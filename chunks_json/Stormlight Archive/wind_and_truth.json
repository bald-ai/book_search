This is\nthe midpoint in the series, and the ending of the first major arc. As such, I\nhave wrestled with this book more than most, giving it a great portion of my\nthoughts, passion, and effort over the last four years. This is, to date, the\nlongest book I’ve ever written—and this is among the longest amounts of\ntime I’ve ever spent on a book. (Probably the longest, if you don’t count\nprojects I set down and came back to years later.) I hope you’ll find the\nresult worth the effort!\nBelow is a list of all the people who worked on the novel behind the\nscenes in various capacities. It’s getting more and more like movie credits,\nwith how many people help. I still write every word, and am the sole author\nof the books, but wow … Dragonsteel as a company has become something\nspectacular. While for most books we keep a pretty normal work schedule,\nStormlight novels are generally an “all hands on deck” situation—with\nsome pulling extra hours to meet deadlines, and others spending a great deal\nof their working days focused only on helping get the book edited,\npublicized, and distributed. So if you ever get a chance to meet them, give\nthem a handshake and a thank-you.\nThen please, sit back and enjoy the show. A highstorm is brewing.\nArtists who worked on this book: Michael Whelan, Donato Giancola,\nMiranda Meeks, Dan dos Santos, Audrey Hotte, Kelley King, Petar Penev,"

When he became a Herald, would his Blade\nbecome like these, imbued with power and lore? “The end of the world.\nWas it a lie?”\nMany who name it such believed what they said, the Stormfather replied.\n“And the owners of these?” he said, gesturing to the Blades. “What did\nthe Heralds believe?”\nIf they had been entirely truthful, the Stormfather said, then I would not\nbe seeking a new champion.\nGavilar nodded. “I swear to serve Honor and Roshar as its Herald. Better\nthan these did.”\nThese words are not accepted, the Stormfather said. You will never find\nthem at random, Gavilar.\nHe would try nonetheless. In becoming the most powerful man in the\nworld, Gavilar had often accomplished what others thought impossible. He\nrounded the ring of Blades again, alone with them in the shadow of\nmonolithic stones. After dozens of visits to this vision, he could name each\nand every Blade by its associated Herald. The Stormfather, however,\ncontinued to be reticent to share information.\nNo matter. He would have his prize. He ripped Jezrien’s long, curved\nBlade from the stone and swung it, cutting the air. “Nohadon met and grew\nto know the Heralds.”\nYes, the Stormfather admitted.\n“They are in there, aren’t they?” he said. “The correct Words are\nsomewhere in The Way of Kings?”\nYes.\nGavilar had the entire book memorized—he’d taught himself to read\nyears ago so he could search for secrets without revealing them to the\nwomen in his life. He tossed the Herald’s Blade aside, letting it clang\nagainst the stone—which made the Stormfather hiss.\nGavilar mentally chided himself. This was just a vision, and these fake\nBlades were nothing to him, but he needed the Stormfather to think him\npious and worthy at least for now. He took up Chana’s Blade. He was fond\nof this one, as its ornamentation bifurcated the blade with a slit down the\ncenter. That long gap would be highly impractical for a normal sword. Here\nit was a symbol that this Blade was something incredible.\n“Chanaranach was a soldier,” he said, “and this is a soldier’s Blade.\nSolid and straight, but with that little impossibility missing from the center.”\nHe held the Blade in front of him, examining its edge. “I feel I know them\neach so well. They are my colleagues, yet I could not pick them out of a\ncrowd.”\nYour colleagues? Do not get ahead of yourself, Gavilar. Find the Words.\nThose storming Words. The most important ones Gavilar would ever say.\nWith them, he would become the Stormfather’s champion—and, he had\ndeduced, something more. Gavilar suspected he would be accepted into the\nOathpact and ascend beyond mortality. He had not asked which Herald he\nwould replace; it felt crass, and he did not want to appear crass before the\nStormfather. He suspected, though, that he would replace Talenelat, the one"

He suspected, though, that he would replace Talenelat, the one\nwho had not left his Blade.\nGavilar stabbed the sword back into the stone. “Let us return.”\nThe vision ended immediately, and he was in the palace’s second-floor\nstudy. Bookshelves, a quiet desk for reading, tapestries and carpets to\ndampen voices. Gavilar wore finery for the upcoming feast: regal robes\nmore archaic than fashionable. Like his beard, the clothing stood out among\nthe Alethi lighteyes. He wanted them to think of him as something ancient,\nbeyond their petty games.\nThis room was technically Navani’s, but it was his palace. People rarely\nlooked for him here, and he needed a reprieve from little people with little\nproblems. As he had time before his meetings, Gavilar selected a small\nbook that listed the latest surveys of the region around the Shattered Plains.\nHe was increasingly certain that place held an ancient unlocked Oathgate.\nThrough it, Gavilar could find the mythical Urithiru, and there, ancient\nrecords.\nHe would find the right Words. He was close. So tantalizingly close to\nwhat all men secretly desired, but only ten had ever achieved. Eternal life,\nand a legacy that spanned millennia—because you could live to shape it.\nIt is not so grand as you think, the spren said. Which gave Gavilar pause.\nThe Stormfather couldn’t read his mind, could it? No. No, he’d tested that.\nIt didn’t know his deepest thoughts, his deepest plans. For if it did know his\nheart, it wouldn’t be working with him.\n“What isn’t?” Gavilar asked, slipping the book back.\nImmortality, the Stormfather said. It wears on men and women,\nweathering souls and minds. The Heralds are insane—afflicted with\nunnatural ailments unique to their ancient natures.\n“How long did it take?” Gavilar asked. “For the symptoms to appear?”\nDifficult to say. A thousand years, perhaps two.\n“Then I will have that long to find a solution,” Gavilar said. “A much\nmore reasonable timeline than the mere century—with luck—afforded a\nmortal. Wouldn’t you say?”\nI have not promised you this boon. You guess it is what I offer, but I seek\nonly a champion. Still, tell me, would you accept the cost of becoming a\nHerald? Everyone you know would be dust by the time you returned.\nAnd here, the lie. “A king’s duty is to his people,” he said. “By becoming\na Herald, I can safeguard Alethkar in a way that no previous monarch ever\nhas. I can endure personal pain to accomplish this. ‘If I should die,’”\nGavilar added, quoting The Way of Kings, “‘then I would do so having lived\nmy life right. It is not the destination that matters, but how one arrives\nthere.’”\nThese words are not accepted, the spren said. Guessing will not bring\nyou to the Words, Gavilar.\nYes, well, the Words were in that volume somewhere. Sheltered among\nthe self-righteous moralizing like a whitespine in the brambles. Gavilar"

Gavilar\nKholin was not a man accustomed to losing. People got what they expected.\nAnd he expected not just victory, but divinity.\nThe guard knocked softly. Was it time already? Gavilar called for Tearim\nto come in, and he did. The guard was wearing Gavilar’s own Plate tonight.\n“Sire,” Tearim said, “your brother is here.”\n“What? Not Restares? How did Dalinar find me?”\n“Spotted us standing watch, I suspect, Your Majesty.”\nBother. “Let him in.”\nThe guard withdrew. A second later Dalinar burst in, graceful as a three-\nlegged chull. He slammed the door and bellowed, “Gavilar! I want to go\ntalk to the Parshendi.”\nGavilar took a long, deep breath. “Brother, this is a very delicate\nsituation, and we don’t want to offend them.”\n“I won’t offend them,” Dalinar grumbled. He wore his takama, the robe\nof the old-fashioned warrior’s garb open to show his powerful chest—with\nsome grey hairs. He pushed past Gavilar and threw himself into the seat by\nthe desk.\nThat poor chair.\n“Why do you even care about them, Dalinar?” Gavilar said, right hand to\nhis forehead.\n“Why do you?” Dalinar demanded. “This treaty, this sudden interest in\ntheir lands. What are you planning? Tell me.”\nDear, blunt Dalinar. As subtle as a jug of Horneater white. And equally\nsmart.\n“Tell me straight,” Dalinar continued. “Are you planning to conquer\nthem?”\n“Why would I be signing a treaty if that were my intent?”\n“I don’t know,” Dalinar said. “I just … I don’t want to see anything\nhappen to them. I like them.”\n“They’re parshmen.”\n“I like parshmen.”\n“You’ve never noticed a parshman unless he was too slow to bring your\ndrink.”\n“There’s something about these ones,” Dalinar said. “I feel a … a\nkinship.”\n“That’s foolish.” Gavilar walked to the desk and leaned down beside his\nbrother. “Dalinar, what’s happening to you? Where is the Blackthorn?”\n“Maybe he’s tired,” Dalinar said. “Or blinded. By the soot and ashes of\nthe dead, constantly in his face …”\nAgain Dalinar whined about the Rift? What an enormous hassle.\nRestares would be here soon, and then … there was Thaidakar. So many\nknives to keep balanced perfectly on their tips, lest they slide and cut\nGavilar. He couldn’t deal with Dalinar having a crisis of conscience right\nnow.\n“Brother,” Gavilar said, “what would Evi say if she saw you like this?”\nIt was a carefully sharpened spear, slipped expertly into Dalinar’s gut.\nThe man’s fingers gripped the table, and he recoiled at her name.\n“She would want you to stand as a warrior,” Gavilar said softly. “And\nprotect Alethkar.”\n“I …” Dalinar whispered. “She …”"

Follow the Codes tonight. There is\nsomething strange upon the winds.”\nThe Codes said not to drink when battle might be imminent. Just a nudge\nto remind Dalinar that it was a feast, and that there was plenty of wine on\nhand. Though Dalinar still thought no one knew he’d killed Evi, Gavilar\nhad found the truth, which let him use these subtle manipulations.\nDalinar was out the door a moment later, his lumbering, pliable brain\nlikely focused on two things. First, what he’d done to Evi. Second, how to\nfind something strong enough to make him forget about the first.\nWhen Dalinar was off down the hallway, Gavilar waved Tearim close.\nThe guard was one of the Sons of Honor, a group that was yet another knife\nGavilar kept balanced, for they could never know he had outgrown their\nplans.\n“Follow my brother,” Gavilar said. “Subtly ensure that he gets\nsomething to drink; maybe lead him to my wife’s secret stores.”\n“You had me do that a few months ago, sire,” Tearim whispered back.\n“There’s not much left, I’m afraid. He likes to share with his soldiers.”\n“Well, find him something,” Gavilar replied. “I can let Restares and the\nothers in when they arrive. Go.”\nThe soldier bowed and followed Dalinar, Shardplate thumping. Gavilar\nshut the door firmly. When the Stormfather’s voice pushed into his mind, he\nwas not surprised.\nHe has potential you do not see, that one.\n“Dalinar? Of course he does. If I can keep him pointed the right\ndirection, he will burn down entire nations.” Gavilar simply had to ply him\nwith alcohol the rest of the time, so that he didn’t burn down this nation.\nHe could be more than you think.\n“Dalinar is a big, dumb, blunt instrument you apply to problems until\nthey break,” Gavilar said, then shivered, remembering seeing his brother\napproach across a battlefield. Soaked in blood. Eyes appearing to glow red\nwithin his helm, hungry for the life Gavilar lived …\nThat ghost haunted him. Fortunately, both Dalinar’s pain and his\naddiction made him easy enough to control.\nGavilar was soon interrupted by another knock. He answered the door\nand found nothing outside, until the Stormfather hissed a warning in his\nmind and he felt a sudden chill.\nWhen he turned around, old Thaidakar was there. The Lord of Scars\nhimself, a figure in an enveloping hooded cloak, tattered at the bottom.\nStorms.\n“I was made promises,” Thaidakar said, hood shadowing his face. “I’ve\ngiven you information, Gavilar, of the most valuable nature. In payment I\nrequested a single man. When will you deliver Restares to me?”\n“Soon,” Gavilar said. “I am gaining his confidence first.”"

When will you deliver Restares to me?”\n“Soon,” Gavilar said. “I am gaining his confidence first.”\n“It seems to me,” Thaidakar said, “that you’re less interested in our\nbargain, and more interested in your own motives. It seems to me that I\ndirected you toward something valuable you’ve decided to keep. It seems to\nme that you play games.”\n“It seems to me,” Gavilar said, stepping closer to the cloaked figure,\n“that you’re not in a position to make demands. You need me. So why don’t\nwe just … keep playing.”\nThaidakar remained still for a moment. Then, with a sigh, he reached up\nwith gloved hands and took down his hood. Gavilar froze—for despite their\nseveral interactions, he’d never before seen the man’s face.\nThaidakar was made entirely of softly glowing white-blue light. He was\nyounger than Gavilar had imagined—in his middle years, not the wizened\nelder he’d seemed. He had a large spike, also blue, through one eye. The\npoint jutted out the back of his skull. Was he some kind of spren?\n“Gavilar,” Thaidakar said, “take care. You’re not immortal yet, but\nyou’ve begun to play with forces that rip mortals apart by their very axi.”\n“Do you know what they are?” Gavilar demanded, hungry. “The most\nimportant Words I’ll ever speak?”\n“No,” Thaidakar said. “But listen: none of this is what you think it is.\nDeliver Restares to my agents, and I will help you recover the ancient\npowers.”\n“I’ve grown beyond that,” Gavilar said.\n“You can’t ‘grow beyond’ the tide, Gavilar,” Thaidakar replied. “You\nswim with it or get swept away. Our plans are already in motion. Though to\nbe honest, I don’t know that we did much. That tide was coming\nregardless.”\nGavilar grunted. “Well, I intend to—”\nHe was cut off as Thaidakar transformed. His face melted into a simple\nfloating sphere with some kind of arcane rune at the center. The cloak,\nbody, and gloves vanished into wisps of smoke that evaporated away.\nGavilar stared. That … that looked a lot like what he’d read of the\npowers of Lightweavers. Knights Radiant. Was Thaidakar—?\n“I know you’re meeting Restares today,” the sphere said, vibrating—it\nhad no mouth. “Prepare him, then deliver him to my agents for questioning.\nOr else. That is my ultimatum, Gavilar. You would not like to be my\nenemy.”\nThe sphere of light shrank and turned nearly transparent as it moved to\nthe door, then bobbed down and vanished through the crack underneath.\n“What was that?” Gavilar demanded of the Stormfather, unnerved.\nSomething dangerous, the spren replied in his mind.\n“Radiant?”\nNo. Similar, but no.\nGavilar found himself trembling.

Not for the first time he wondered if\nNavani could crack this problem. He missed the way they’d once schemed.\nHow long had it been since they’d all laughed together?

Refusing to think of the mountain because she worried about the\nplacement of the foothills.\nHe regretted the distance between them. That coldness growing over—\nwell, grown over—their relationship. Thinking of her sent a stab of pain\ninto his heart. He should …\nEveryone you know will be dust by the time you return …\nPerhaps this way was best.\nHe had plans to mitigate the length of his absence from this world, but\nthey might take several tries to perfect. So … fewer attachments seemed\nbetter. To allow for a cleaner cut. Like one made with a Shardblade.\nHe bent his mind to his plans, and was well prepared by the time\nRestares arrived. The balding man didn’t knock. He peeked in, nervously\nchecking each corner before he slipped through the door. He was followed\nby a shadow: a tall, imperious Makabaki man with a birthmark on one\ncheek. Gavilar had instructed the servants to treat them as ambassadors, but\nhe hadn’t yet had a chance to speak with this second man, whom he didn’t\nknow.\nThe newcomer walked with a certain … firmness. Rigidity. He wasn’t a\nman who gave way. Not to wind, not to storm, and most certainly not to\nother people.\n“Gavilar Kholin,” the man said, offering neither a hand nor a bow. They\nlocked stares. Impressive. Gavilar had expected … well, someone more like\nRestares.\n“Have a drink,” Gavilar said, gesturing toward the bar.\n“No,” the man said. Without a thank-you or compliment. Interesting.\nIntriguing.\nRestares scuttled over like a child offered sweets. Even now—after\njoining this newest incarnation of the Sons of Honor—Gavilar found\nRestares … odd. The short, balding man sniffed at each of the wines. He\nhad never trusted a drink in Gavilar’s presence, but always tested them\nanyway. As if he wanted to find poison, to prove his paranoia was justified.\n“Sorry,” Restares said, wringing his hands as he hovered over the drinks.\n“Sorry. Not … not thirsty today, Gavilar. Sorry.”\nGavilar was close to tossing him aside and seizing control of the Sons of"

        "text": "“Sorry. Not … not thirsty today, Gavilar. Sorry.”\nGavilar was close to tossing him aside and seizing control of the Sons of\nHonor. Except some of the others, like Amaram, respected him. Plus …\nwhy was Thaidakar so interested in Restares? Surely he couldn’t actually be\nsomeone important. Perhaps his tall friend was the true power. Could\nGavilar have been kept in the dark for two years about something that vital?\n“I’m glad you were willing to meet,” Restares said. “Yes, um. Because,\num. So … Announcement. I have an announcement.”\nGavilar frowned. “What is this?”\n“I hear,” Restares said, “that you’re looking to, um, restore the\nVoidbringers?”\n“You founded the Sons of Honor, Restares,” Gavilar said, “to recover the\nancient oaths and restore the Knights Radiant. Well, they vanished when the\nVoidbringers did. So if we bring back the Voidbringers, the powers should\nreturn.”\nMore importantly, he thought, the Heralds will return from the land of\nthe dead to lead us again.\nLetting me usurp the position of one of them.\n“No, no, no,” Restares said, uncharacteristically firm. “I wanted the\nhonor of men to return! I wanted us to explore what made those Radiants so\ngrand. Before things went wrong.” He ran his hand through his thinning\nhair. “Before … I made them … go wrong …”\nRestares wouldn’t meet Gavilar’s eyes. “We … we should stop trying to\nrestore the powers,” Restares said, his voice wilting, and glanced to his\nstern friend—as if for support. “We can’t … afford another Return …”\n“Restares,” Gavilar said, advancing on the little man. “What is wrong\nwith you? You’re talking about betraying everything we believe?” Or at\nleast pretend to believe. Gavilar subtly placed himself so he loomed over\nRestares. “Have you heard of a man named Thaidakar?”\nRestares looked up, his eyes widening.\n“He wants to find you,” Gavilar said. “I have protected you thus far.\nWhat is it he wants from you, Restares?”\n“Secrets,” Restares whispered. “The man … can’t abide … anyone\nhaving secrets.”\n“What secrets?” Gavilar said firmly, making Restares cringe. “I’ve put\nup with your lies long enough. What is going on? What does Thaidakar\nwant?”\n“I know where she is hidden,” Restares whispered. “Where her soul is.\nBa-Ado-Mishram. Granter of Forms. The one who could rival Him. The\none … we betrayed.”\nBa-Ado-Mishram? Why would Thaidakar care about an Unmade? It\nseemed such an oddly shaped piece of the puzzle. Gavilar opened his mouth\nto speak, but a hand squeezed his shoulder, fingers like a vise. Gavilar\nturned to see Restares’s Makabaki friend standing behind him.\n“What have you done?” the man asked, his voice icy. “Gavilar Kholin.\nWhat actions have you taken to achieve this goal of yours, the one that my\nfriend mistakenly set you upon?”"

Restares, you must not\nlose your nerve now!”\nThe stranger stared, his lips parting. He reached toward one of the\nspheres that glowed with a dark, almost inverted violet light. Impossible\nlight; a color that should not exist. As soon as the stranger’s fingers drew\nclose, he yanked them away, then turned wide eyes on Gavilar.\n“You are a fool,” the man said. “A terrible fool charging toward the\nhighstorm with a stick, thinking to fight it. What have you done? Where did\nyou get Voidlight?”\nGavilar smiled. None of them knew of the secret scholar he kept in\nreserve. A master of all things scientific. A man who was neither\nGhostblood nor Son of Honor.\nA man from another world.\n“It is set in motion,” Gavilar said, glancing at Restares. “And the project\nwas a success.”\nRestares perked up. “It … it was? Is that Light …” He turned to his\nfriend. “This could work, Nale! We could bring them back, then destroy\nthem. It could work.”\nNale. Oh, storms. Gavilar knew—but tried to ignore—that Restares\npretended to be a Herald to impress the others. The little man didn’t know\nGavilar had become familiar with the Stormfather, who had told him the\ntruth: that the Heralds had all long since died and gone to Braize.\nSo was this stranger pretending to be Nalan, Herald of Justice? He …\nhad the right look. Many of the depictions were of an imperious Makabaki\nman. And that birthmark … it was strikingly similar to one on several of the\nolder paintings.\nBut no. That was ridiculous. To believe that, one would have to believe\nthat Restares—of all people—was a Herald.\nThe stranger tried to stare Gavilar down. Motionless, his expression\ncold. A monolith instead of a man. “This is far too dangerous.”\nGavilar continued to hold his gaze. The world would bend to his desires.\nIt always had before.\n“But you are,” the man eventually said, stepping back, “the king. Your\nwill … is law … in this land.”\n“Yes,” Gavilar said. “That is correct. Restares, I have more good news.\nWe can move Voidlight from the storm to the Physical Realm. We can even\ncarry it between here and Damnation, as you wanted.”\n“That’s a way,” Restares said, looking to Nale. “A way … maybe to\nescape …”\nNale waved to the spheres. “Being able to bring them back and forth\nfrom Braize doesn’t mean anything. It’s too close to be a relevant distance.”\n“It was impossible only a few short years ago,” Gavilar said. “This is\nproof. The Connection is not severed, and the box allows for travel. Not yet"

        "text": "“It was impossible only a few short years ago,” Gavilar said. “This is\nproof. The Connection is not severed, and the box allows for travel. Not yet\nas far as you’d like, but we must start the journey somewhere.”\nHe wasn’t certain why Restares was so eager to move Light around in\nShadesmar. Thaidakar wanted this information as well. A way to transport\nStormlight, and this new Voidlight, long distances. As he was contemplating\nthat, Gavilar saw something. The door was cracked. An eye was peeking\nthrough.\nDamnation. It was Navani. How much had she heard?\n“Husband,” she said, immediately pushing into the room. “There are\nguests missing you at the gathering. You seem to have lost track of time.”\nHe smothered his anger at her spying, turning to Restares and his friend.\n“Gentlemen, I will need to excuse myself.”\nRestares again ran his hand through his wispy hair. “I want to know\nmore of the project, Gavilar. Plus, you need to know that another of us is\nhere tonight. I spotted her handiwork earlier.”\nAnother one? Another Son of Honor.\nNo, he meant another Herald. Restares was growing more delusional.\n“I have a meeting shortly with Meridas and the others,” Gavilar said,\ncalmly soothing Restares. “They should have more information for me. We\ncan speak again after that.”\n“No,” the Makabaki man growled. “I doubt we shall.”\n“There’s more here, Nale!” Restares said, though he followed as Gavilar\nushered the two of them from the room. “This is important! I want out. This\nis the only way …”\nGavilar shut the door. Then turned to his wife. Damnation, she should\nknow better than to interrupt him. She …\nStorms. The dress was beautiful, her face more so, even when angry.\nStaring at him with brilliant eyes, a fiery halo almost seeming to spread\naround her.\nOnce more, he considered.\nOnce more he rejected the idea.\nIf he was going to be a god, best to sever attachments. The sun could\nlove the stars. But never as an equal.\nSome time later, after he’d seen to Navani, Gavilar slipped away again. To\nhis chambers this time, where he could confront what he’d learned.\n“Tell me,” he said, walking across the springy carpet to regard the\ntabletop map of Roshar. “Why is Thaidakar so interested in Ba-Ado-\nMishram?”\nThe Stormfather formed a rippling beside Gavilar, vaguely in the shape\nof a person, but indistinct. Like the wavering in the air made by great heat\non the stones.\nShe created your parshmen by accident, he said. Long ago, just before\nthe Recreance, Mishram tried to rise up and replace Odium, giving the\nVoidbringers powers.\n“Curious,” Gavilar said. “And then?”\nAnd then … she fell. She was too small a being to uphold an entire\npeople. It all came crashing down, and so some brave Radiants trapped\nMishram in a gemstone to prevent her from destroying all of Roshar. A side\neffect created the parshmen."

        "text": "people. It all came crashing down, and so some brave Radiants trapped\nMishram in a gemstone to prevent her from destroying all of Roshar. A side\neffect created the parshmen.\nSimple parshmen. They were Voidbringers. A delicious secret he’d pried\nout of the Stormfather some weeks ago. Gavilar strolled to the bookcase,\nwhere one of the new heating fabrials had been delivered to him by the\nscholar Rushur Kris. He took it from its cloth casing, weighing it.\nHe had found a way to ferry Voidspren through Shadesmar to this world\nusing gemstones and aluminum boxes. Who would have thought Navani’s\npet area of study would be so useful? And if that conniving Axindweth\neluded his grasp, he’d have to do the next part without her. He had his\nscholar, though in truth Gavilar was baffled by the Light he was creating …\nLight that could somehow kill the Voidbringers? How had Vasher made—\nHe thought he heard a faint crackling sound from the Stormfather.\nLightning? How cute.\n“You’ve never challenged what I’m doing,” Gavilar said. “I would have\nthought that returning the Voidbringers would be opposed to your very\nnature.”\nOpposition is sometimes needed, the Stormfather said. You will need\nsomeone to fight, should you become champion.\n“Give it to me,” Gavilar said. “Now. Make me a Herald. I need it.”\nThe Stormfather turned a shimmering head in his direction. That was\nalmost them.\n“What, those?” Gavilar said. “A demand?”\nSo close. And so far.\nGavilar smiled, hefting the fabrial and thinking of the flamespren\ntrapped inside. The Stormfather seemed increasingly suspicious, hostile. If\nthings did go poorly … could he trap the Stormfather himself in one of\nthese?\nSoon Amaram arrived with a small collection of people: two men, two\nwomen. One man was Amaram’s lieutenant. The other three would be new\nimportant Sons of Honor recruits, invited to the feast and given exclusive\ntime with the king after. It was an annoyance, but a worthy one. Gavilar\nidentified the two women from the notes, but not the older man in robes.\nWho was he? A stormwarden? Amaram liked to keep them around, to teach\nhim their script, which preserved some semblance of Vorin devotion. That\nwas important to him.\nGavilar met each guest in turn, and as he reached the older man,\nsomething clicked. This was Taravangian, the king of Kharbranth.\nFamously a man of little consequence or aptitude. Gavilar glanced at\nAmaram. Surely they weren’t going to invite him into their confidence—\nthey should find the power who secretly ruled Kharbranth. Likely to be one\nof two women, per Gavilar’s spy reports.\nAmaram nodded. So, Gavilar gave his speech about ancient oaths and\nRadiants—of glories past and futures bright. It was a good speech, but\nbeginning to grate on him. Once his words had inspired troops; now he\nspent his entire life in meetings. After finishing, he let everyone get\nsomething to drink.\n“Meridas,” Gavilar whispered, pulling Amaram aside. “These meetings"

After finishing, he let everyone get\nsomething to drink.\n“Meridas,” Gavilar whispered, pulling Amaram aside. “These meetings\nare growing onerous. My experiment was a success. I have the weapon.”\nAmaram started, then spoke softly. “You mean …”\n“Yes, once we bring back the Voidbringers, we will have a new way to\nfight them.”\n“Or a new way to control them,” Amaram whispered.\nWell, that was new. Gavilar considered his friend, and the ambition those\nwords implied. Good for you, Amaram.\n“We must restore the Desolations,” Gavilar said. “Whatever the cost. It’s\nthe only way.”\n“I agree,” Amaram said. “Now more than ever.” He hesitated. “My\nefforts with your daughter did not go well earlier. I thought we had an\nunderstanding.”\n“You simply need more time, my friend. To win her over.”\nAmaram hungered for the throne like Gavilar hungered for immortality.\nAnd perhaps Gavilar would reward Amaram with it. Elhokar certainly did\nnot deserve to be king. He was exactly the opposite of the legacy Gavilar\nwanted.\nHe sent Amaram to talk to the others. Once they had enjoyed their\ndrinks, Gavilar would give another short speech. Then he could be on to …\nHe frowned, noticing that one of the new recruits wasn’t conversing with\nthe others. The elderly man, Taravangian, was staring at the map of Roshar.\nThe others laughed at something Amaram said. Taravangian didn’t even\nlook toward the sound.\nGavilar strode over, but before he could speak, Taravangian whispered,\n“Do you ever wonder about the lives we’re giving them? The people we\nrule?”\nGavilar was unaccustomed to people—let alone strangers—addressing\nhim with such familiarity. But then, this Taravangian saw himself as a king,\nand perhaps as Gavilar’s equal. Laughable, when Taravangian ruled only\none small city.\n“I worry less about their lives now,” Gavilar said, “and more about what\nis to come.”\nTaravangian nodded, appearing thoughtful. “That was an inspiring\nspeech. Do you actually believe it?”\n“Would I say it if I didn’t?”\n“Of course you would; a king will say whatever needs to be said.\nWouldn’t it be grand if that were always what he believed?” He looked to\nGavilar, smiling. “Do you truly believe the Radiants can return?”\n“Yes,” Gavilar said. “I do.”\n“And you are not a fool,” Taravangian said, musing. “So you must have\ngood reasons.”\nGavilar found himself revising his earlier opinion. A little king was still a\nking. Perhaps, among all of the dignitaries in the city tonight, here was one\nwho might … in the smallest way … understand the demands placed on the\nman pressed between crown and throne.\n“A danger is coming,” Gavilar said softly, shocked at his own sincerity.\n“To this land. This world. An ancient danger.”\nTaravangian narrowed his eyes.\n“It’s not just a Desolation we must fear,” Gavilar said. “They come. The"

The Night of Sorrows.”\nTaravangian, remarkably, grew pale.\nHe believed. Gavilar usually felt foolish when he tried to explain the true\ndangers that the Stormfather had shown him—the contest of champions for\nthe fate of Roshar. He worried people would think him mad. Yet this man\n… believed him?\n“Where,” Taravangian asked, “did you hear those words?”\n“I don’t know that you’d believe me if I told you.”\n“Will you believe me?” Taravangian asked. “Ten years ago, my mother\ndied of her tumors. Frail, lying on her bed, with too many perfumes\nstruggling to smother the stench of death. She gazed at me in her last\nmoments …” He met Gavilar’s eyes. “And she whispered: ‘I stand before\nhim, above the world itself, and he speaks the truth. The Desolation is near\n… The Everstorm. The Night of Sorrows.’ Then she was gone.”\n“I’ve … heard of this,” Gavilar admitted. “The prophetic words of the\ndying …”\n“Where did you hear those words?” Taravangian asked, practically\nbegging. “Please.”\n“I see visions,” Gavilar said, frank. “Given me by the Almighty. So that\nwe may prepare.” He looked toward the map. “Heralds send that I may\nbecome the person I need to be to stop what is coming …”\nLet the Stormfather see sincerity in Gavilar. Storms … suddenly Gavilar\nfelt it. Standing there with this little king, he felt it. Never before—in all of\nthis—had Gavilar ever suspected he might be inadequate to the task.\nPerhaps, he thought, I should encourage Dalinar to resume his training.\nRemind him that he is a soldier. Gavilar had the distinct impression that\nbefore too long, he would need the Blackthorn again.\nSomeone is approaching your door outside, the Stormfather warned. One\nof the listeners. Eshonai. There is something about this one …\nOne of the Parshendi? Gavilar shook himself. He dismissed Taravangian,\nAmaram, and the others—happy to be rid of that strange old man and his\nquestioning eyes. The fellow was supposed to be unremarkable. Why did he\nunnerve Gavilar?\nEshonai entered as Amaram passed along his invitation. The\nconversation with the parshwoman went smoothly, with him manipulating\nher—and therefore her people. To prepare them for the role they would\nplay.\nAfter Gavilar grew weary at the feast once the treaty was signed, he retired\nto his rooms. He sank into a deep plush chair by his balcony, releasing a\nlong sigh. Early in his career as a warlord, he’d never allowed himself the\nluxury of softness. He had mistakenly assumed that liking something soft\nwould make him soft.\nA common failing among men who wished to appear strong. It was not\nweakness to relax. By being so afraid of it, they gave simple things power\nover them.\nThe air shimmered in front of him."

By being so afraid of it, they gave simple things power\nover them.\nThe air shimmered in front of him.\n“A full day,” Gavilar said.\nYes.\n“The first of many such,” Gavilar continued. “I will be mounting an\nexpedition back to the Shattered Plains soon. We can leverage my new\ntreaty to obtain guides, have them lead us inward to the center. Toward\nUrithiru.”\nThe Stormfather did not reply. Gavilar wasn’t certain the spren could be\nsaid to have human mannerisms. Today though … that turned-away posture,\nhinted at in the warping of the air … that silence …\n“Do you regret choosing me?” Gavilar asked.\nI regret the way I have treated you, the Stormfather said. I should not\nhave been so accommodating. It has made you lazy.\n“This is lazy?” Gavilar said, forcing amusement into his voice to hide his\nannoyance.\nYou do not reverence the position you seek, the Stormfather said. I feel …\nyou are not the champion I need. Maybe … I’ve been wrong all this time.\n“You said that you were charged with this task of finding a champion,”\nGavilar said. “By Honor.”\nThat is true. I do not speak in human ways. But still, if you become a\nHerald, you will be tortured between Returns. Why is it this doesn’t bother\nyou?\nGavilar shrugged. “I will just give in.”\nWhat?\n“Give in,” Gavilar said, heaving himself out of his seat. “Why stay to be\ntortured and potentially lose my mind? I will give up each time and return\nimmediately.”\nThe Heralds stay in Damnation to seal the Voidbringers away. To\nprevent them from overrunning the world. They—\n“The Heralds are the ten fools for that,” Gavilar explained, pouring a\ndrink from the carafe near his balcony. “If I cannot die, I will be the greatest\nking this world has ever known. Why lock away my knowledge and\nleadership?”\nTo stop the war.\n“Why would I care to stop a war?” Gavilar asked, genuinely amused.\n“War is the path to glory, to training our soldiers to recover the Tranquiline\nHalls. My troops should be experienced, don’t you think?” He turned back\ntoward the shimmer, taking a sip of orange wine. “I don’t fear these\nVoidbringers. Let them stay and fight. If they are reborn, then we will never\nrun out of enemies to kill.”\nThe Stormfather did not respond. And again Gavilar tried to read into the\nthing’s posture. Was the Stormfather proud of him? Gavilar considered this\nan elegant solution; he was puzzled why the Heralds had never thought of\nit. Perhaps they were cowards.\nAh, Gavilar, the Stormfather said. I see my miscalculation. Your entire\nreligious upbringing … created from the lies of Aharietiam and Honor’s\nown failings … it pointed you toward this conclusion.\nDamnation. The Stormfather wasn’t pleased.

His body didn’t hurt. That was an extremely\nbad sign.\nThaidakar, he thought as a figure rose before him, shadowed in the night\nair. Only Thaidakar could send an assassin who could do such things.\nGavilar coughed as the figure loomed over him. “I … expected you … to\ncome.”\nThe assassin knelt before him, though Gavilar couldn’t see anything\nmore than shadows. Then … the assassin—doing something Gavilar\ncouldn’t make out—again glowed like a sphere.\n“You can tell … Thaidakar,” Gavilar whispered, “that he’s too late …”\n“I don’t know who that is,” the assassin said, the words barely\nintelligible. The man held his hand to the side. Summoning a Blade.\nThis was it. Behind the assassin a halo, a corona of shimmering light.\nThe Stormfather.\nI did not cause this, the Stormfather said in his head. I do not know\nwhether that brings you peace in your last moments, Gavilar.\nBut …\n“Then who …?” Gavilar forced out. “Restares? Sadeas? I never thought\n…”\n“My masters are the Parshendi,” the assassin said."

What was happening?\n“The Parshendi? That makes no sense.”\nThis is my failure as much as yours, the Stormfather said. If I try again, I\nwill do it differently. I thought … your family …\nHis family. In that moment, Gavilar saw his legacy crumbling. He was\ndying.\nStorms. He was dying. What did anything matter? He couldn’t. He\ncouldn’t …\nHe was supposed to be eternal …\nI’ve invited the enemy back, he realized. The end is coming. And my\nfamily, my kingdom, will be destroyed, without a way to fight. Unless …\nHand quivering, he pulled a sphere out of his pocket. The weapon. They\nneeded this. His son … No, his son could not handle such power … They\nneeded a warrior. A true warrior. One that Gavilar had been doing his best\nto suppress, out of a fear he barely dared acknowledge, even as he drew his\nlast ragged breaths.\nDalinar.

Tell … tell my brother … he must find the most important words\na man can say …”\nNo, the Stormfather said, though a hand took the sphere. Not him. I’m\nsorry, Gavilar. I made that mistake once. I will never trust your family\nagain.\nGavilar gave a whine of pain, not from his body but from his soul. He\nhad failed. He had brought them all to ruin. That, he realized with horror,\nwould be his legacy.\nIn the end, Gavilar Kholin, heir to the Heralds, died. As all men,\nultimately, must.\nAlone.\nI should have known I was being watched.

Beyond that, Dalinar had made a deal with the\nenemy: in just ten days, the champion of Honor and the champion of Odium\nwould decide the fate of all Roshar.\nThe scope of that was terrifying, yet Kaladin had stepped down as leader\nof the Windrunners.

And\nwhen the champions met atop Urithiru in ten days—nine, since the first day\nwas underway—Kaladin wouldn’t participate.\nThat should have made him an anxious, stewing pot of nerves. Instead he\ntipped his head back, sun warm on his skin, and acknowledged that while\nhe didn’t feel great, someday he would feel great again.\nFor today, that was enough.\nHe turned and strode to his closet, where he picked through stacks of\ncivilian clothing neatly laundered and delivered this morning. The city was\na mere two days free from occupation and the fate of the world approached,\nbut Urithiru’s washwomen soldiered on. None of the clothes appealed to\nhim, and shortly he glanced at another option: a uniform sent by the\nquartermaster to replace the one Kaladin had ruined during the fighting.\nLeyten kept a rack of them in Kaladin’s size.\nKaladin had stuck the uniform to the wall with a Lashing last night, after\nTeft’s funeral, as a test. Urithiru was awake, with its own Bondsmith,\nmaking things … different. His Lashings normally lasted minutes at best—\nyet here this one was, ten hours later, still going strong.\nSyl poked her head into his room—past the hanging cloth doorway—\nwithout any thought for privacy. Today she appeared at full human size and\nwore a havah rather than her usual girlish dress. She’d recently learned how\nto color her dress, in this case mostly darker shades of blue with some\nbright violet embroidery on her sleeves.\nAs Kaladin fastened the last buttons on the high collar of his uniform\njacket, Syl bounced over to stand behind him. Then she floated a foot or so\ninto the air to look over his shoulder and examine him in the mirror.\n“Can’t you make yourself any size?” he asked, checking his jacket cuffs.\n“Within reason.”\n“Whose reason?”\n“No idea,” she said. “Tried to get as big as a mountain once. It involved\nlots of grunting and thinking like rocks. Really big rocks. Biggest I could\nmanage was a very small mountain—small enough to fit in this room, with\nthe tip brushing the ceiling.”\n“Then you could be tall enough to tower over me,” he said. “Why do you\nusually make yourself shorter?”\n“It just feels right,” she said.\n“That’s your explanation for basically everything.”\n“Yup!” She poked him. He could barely feel it. Even at this size, she was\ninsubstantial in the Physical Realm. “Uniform? I thought you weren’t going\nto wear one anymore.”\nHe hesitated, then pulled the jacket down at the bottom to smooth the\nwrinkles across the sides. “It just feels right,” he admitted, meeting her eyes\nin the mirror.\nShe grinned. And storm him, he couldn’t help grinning back.\n“Someone is having a good day,” she said, poking him again.\n“Bizarrely,” Kaladin said. “Considering.”\n“At least the war is almost over,” she said. “One more contest.

        "text": "“At least the war is almost over,” she said. “One more contest. Nine\ndays.”\nTrue. If Dalinar won, Odium had agreed to withdraw from Alethkar and\nHerdaz—though he could keep other lands he controlled, like Iri and Jah\nKeved. If Odium won, they were forced to cede Alethkar to the enemy. Plus\nthere was a greater cost. If Dalinar lost, he had to join Odium, become\nFused, and help conquer the cosmere. Kaladin wanted to think that the\nRadiants wouldn’t follow as well, but he wasn’t certain. So many people\nthirsted for war, even without the influence of an Unmade. Storms, he’d felt\nit too.\n“Syl,” he said, dropping his smile. “I’m sure more people are going to\ndie. Perhaps people I care about, but I can’t be there to help them. Dalinar\nwill have to choose someone else to be champion and—”\n“Kaladin Stormblessed,” she said, rising higher into the air, arms folded.\nThough she wore a fashionable havah, she left her hair white-blue, flowing\nfree, waving and shifting in the wind. The … nonexistent wind. “Don’t you\ndare talk yourself into being miserable.”\n“Or what?”\n“Or I,” she thundered, “shall make silly faces at you. As I alone can.”\n“They aren’t silly,” he said, shivering.\n“They’re hilarious.”\n“Last time you made a tentacle come out of your forehead.”\n“Highbrow comedy.”\n“Then it slapped me.”\n“Punch line. Obviously. All the humans in the world, and I picked the\none without a taste for refined humor.”\nHe met her eyes, and her smile was still storming infectious.\n“It does feel warm,” he said, “to have finally figured a few things out. To\nlet go of the weight and step out from the shadow. I know darkness will\nreturn, but I think … I think I’ll be able to remember better than before.”\n“Remember what?”\nHe Lashed himself upward, floating until he was eye level with her.\n“That days like this exist too.”\nShe nodded firmly.\n“I wish I could show Teft,” Kaladin said. “I feel his loss like a hole in\nmy own flesh, Syl.”\n“I know,” she said softly.\nIf she’d been a human friend, she might have offered a hug. Syl didn’t\nseem to understand physicality like a human did, though where she’d been\nborn—Shadesmar, the Cognitive Realm—she had a substantial body. He\nhad the sense she hadn’t spent much time on that side. This realm suited\nher.\nDropping to the ground, Kaladin walked back to the window, wanting to\nfeel the sunlight. Outside he saw the heights of the mountains, capped by\nsnow. Wind blew across him, bringing with it fresh scents of clean, crisp air\nand a flock of windspren. Including those that made up his armor, who\nsoared in around him. They stayed close, in case they were needed.\nStorms, he’d been through so much so quickly. He felt echoes of an\nanger that had almost entirely consumed him at Teft’s death. Worse, the\nfeeling of nothingness as he fell …\nDark days.\nBut days like this existed too."

Worse, the\nfeeling of nothingness as he fell …\nDark days.\nBut days like this existed too.\nAnd he would remember.\nHis armor spren laughed and danced out the window, but the wind\nlingered, playing with his hair. Then it calmed, still blowing across him, but\nno longer playful, more … contemplative. All through his life, the wind had\nbeen there. He knew it almost like he did his hometown or his family.\nFamiliar …\nKaladin …\nHe jumped, then glanced at Syl, who was walking through the room in a\nhalf dance, half stride, her eyes closed—as if moving to an inaudible beat.\n“Syl,” Kaladin said, “did you say my name?”\n“Huh?” she said, opening her eyes.\nKaladin …\nStorms. There it was again.\nI need your help. I’m so sorry … to ask more of you …\n“Tell me you hear that,” Kaladin said to Syl.\n“I feel …” She cocked her head. “I feel something. On the wind.”\n“It’s speaking to me,” he said, one hand to his head.\nA storm is coming, Kaladin, the wind whispered. The worst storm … I’m\nsorry …\nIt was gone.\n“What did you hear?” Syl asked.\n“A warning,” he said, frowning. “Syl, is the wind … alive?”\n“Everything is alive.”\nHe gazed outward, waiting for the voice to return. It didn’t. Just that\ncrisp breeze—though now it didn’t seem calm.\nNow it seemed to be waiting for something.\nShallan lingered atop Lasting Integrity, the great fortress of the honorspren,\nthinking about all the people she’d been. The way she changed, based on\nperspective.\nIndeed, life was largely about perspective.\nLike this strange structure: a hollow, rectangular block hundreds of feet\ntall, dominating Shadesmar’s landscape. People—spren—lived along the\ninside walls, walking up and down them, ignoring conventions of gravity.\nLooking down along one of the inside walls could be stomach-churning\nunless you changed your perspective. Unless you convinced yourself that\nwalking up and down that wall was normal. Whether a person was strong or\nnot wasn’t usually subject to debate, yet if gravity could be a matter of\nopinion …\nShe turned away from the heart of Lasting Integrity and walked along\nthe very top of the wall. Looking outward to survey Shadesmar: rolling\nocean of beads in one direction, jagged obsidian highlands—lined with\ncrystalline trees—in the other. On the wall with her, an even more daunting\nsight: two spren with heads made of geometric lines, each wearing a robe of\nsome too-stiff glossy black material.\nTwo spren.\nShe’d bonded two. One during her childhood. One as an adult. She’d\nhurt the first, and had suppressed the memory.\nShallan knelt before Testament, her original spren. The Cryptic sat with\nher back to the stone railing. The lines and pattern that made up her head\nwere crooked, like broken twigs. In the center the lines were scratched and\nrough, as if someone had taken a knife to them. More telling, her pattern\nwas almost frozen."

More telling, her pattern\nwas almost frozen.\nNearby, Pattern’s head pulsed to a vibrant rhythm—always moving,\nalways forming some new geometric display. Comparing the two broke\nShallan’s heart. She had done this to Testament by rejecting the bond after\nusing her Shardblade to kill her mother.\nTestament reached out with a long-fingered hand, and Shallan—pained\n—took it. It gripped hers lightly, but Shallan had the sense that was all the\nstrength Testament had. She responded to being a deadeye differently from\nMaya, who stood nearby with Adolin and Kelek. Maya had always seemed\nstrong of body, in spite of being a deadeye. Spren broke in different ways, it\nappeared. Just like people.\nTestament squeezed Shallan’s hand, bearing no expression but that torpid\nmotion of lines.\n“Why?” Shallan asked. “Why don’t you hate me?”\nPattern rested his hand on Shallan’s shoulder. “We both knew the danger,\nthe sacrifice, in bonding to humans again.”\n“I hurt her.”\n“Yet here you are,” Pattern said. “Able to stand tall. Able to control the\nSurges. Able to protect this world.”\n“She should hate me,” Shallan whispered. “But there is no vitriol in the\nway she holds my hand. No judgment in the way she remains with us.”\n“Because the sacrifice was worth something, Shallan,” Pattern said,\nuncharacteristically reserved. “It worked. In the end you recovered, did\nbetter. I am still here. And remarkably, I am not even a little bit dead! I do\nnot think you will kill me at all, Shallan! I am happy about that.”\n“Can I heal her?” Shallan asked. “Maybe if I … if I bond her again?”\n“I think, after talking to Kelek …” Pattern said. “I think you are still\nbonded to her.”\n“But …” Shallan glanced over her shoulder at him. “I broke the bond.\nThat did this.”\n“Some breaks are messy,” Pattern said. “A slice with a sharpened knife is\nclean; a slice with a dull one is ragged. Your break, done by a child without\nfull Intent, is ragged. In some ways that makes it worse, but it does mean\nthat some Connection between you two persists.”\n“So …”\n“So no,” Pattern said. “I do not think that merely saying Words once\nmore would heal her.” His head pattern spun a little more slowly, as if he\nwere contemplating something profound. “These numbers are …\nperplexing, Shallan. Strangely irrational, in a sequence I do not understand.\nI mean … I mean that we are walking on unfamiliar ground. A better\nmetaphor for you. Yes. Unfamiliar ground. In the deep past, deadeyes did\nnot exist.”\nIt was what they’d learned, in part, from the honorspren and from Maya.\nThe deadeyes—all of them except Testament—had been bonded to ancient\nRadiants before the Recreance. Together they’d rejected their oaths, humans\nand spren alike. They’d thought it would cause a painful, but survivable\nsplit. Instead, something had gone terribly wrong."

Instead, something had gone terribly wrong.\nThe result had been the deadeyes. The explanation might lie with Kelek,\nthe very person Shallan had been sent to Lasting Integrity to kill. She\nsqueezed Testament’s hand. “I’m going to help you,” Shallan whispered.\n“Whatever it takes.”\nTestament didn’t respond, but Shallan leaned in, wrapping her arms\naround the Cryptic. Pattern’s robe always felt hard, yet Testament’s bent\nlike cloth.\n“Thank you,” Shallan said. “For coming to me when I was young. Thank\nyou for protecting me. I still do not remember it all, but thank you.”\nThe Cryptic slowly, but deliberately, put her arms around Shallan and\nsqueezed back.\n“Rest now,” Shallan said, wiping her eyes and standing. “I’m going to\nfigure this out.”\nI first knew the Wind as a child, during days before I knew\ndreams. What need has a child of dreams or aspirations? They\nlive, and love, the life that is.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 3\nSyl eventually trailed out of Kaladin’s room and into his family’s quarters.\nHe lingered in the sunlight and wind, hovering, because why not? Light\nhere was constantly replenished, and holding the tower’s new Light seemed\nnot to push him to action the way Stormlight did. Instead, holding it was …\ncalming.\nYet he jumped when a loud noise sounded from farther inside, a set of\nshockspren snapping into appearance around him, like breaking yellow\ntriangles. When he reached the doorway, however, he found the noise was\njust his little brother, Oroden, clapping. Kaladin calmed his thundering\nheart. He had lately become more prone to overreact to loud noises—\nincluding ones that, upon reflection, were obviously nothing dangerous.\nNo further words came from the wind, so Kaladin hovered out into the\nmain room, where Oroden was playing with his blocks. Syl had joined him.\nThough she could make herself invisible, she rarely chose to around his\nfamily. Indeed, last night they had discussed a new procedure: When she\nappeared with color on her clothing, like the violet on her sleeves, it meant\nshe was visible to others. When she appeared as a uniform light blue, only\nhe could see her.\n“Gagadin!” the little boy said, pointing. “You need bocks!”\n“You” in this case meant Oroden himself—who had noticed that\neveryone called him “you.” Kaladin smiled, and used his Light to make the\nblocks hover. Syl, shrinking down, hopped from block to block in the air as\nOroden swatted them.\nWhat am I doing? Kaladin thought. A contest for the fate of the world is\napproaching, my best friend is dead, and I’m playing blocks with my little\nbrother?\nThen in response, a familiar voice spoke from deep within him. Hold to\nthis, Kal. Embrace it. I didn’t die so you could mope around like a wet\nHorneater with no razor. Unlike the wind, this didn’t seem anything"

Instead … well, Kaladin had known Teft long enough to\nanticipate what the man would have said. Even in death, a good sergeant\nknew his job: keep the officers pointed the right way.\n“Fyl!” Oroden said, gesturing to Syl. “Fyl, come fin!” He started\nspinning in circles, and she joined in, twirling around him. Laughterspren,\nlike silver minnows, appeared in the air. That was another difference in the\ntower lately—spren were everywhere, showing up far more frequently.\nKaladin sat on the floor amid hovering blocks, and was forced to think\nabout his place. He wasn’t going to be Dalinar’s champion, and he wasn’t\nthe leader of Bridge Four any longer. Sigzil went to important meetings in\nKaladin’s place.\nSo who was he? What was he?\nYou are … the wind’s voice said softly. You are what I need …\nHe went alert. No, he was not imagining that.\nHis mother entered, wearing her hair tied with a kerchief, like she always\nhad when working in Hearthstone. She settled down next to him, nudged\nhim in the side, then handed him a bowl with some boiled lavis grain and\nspiced crab meat on top. Kaladin dutifully started eating. If there was a\ngroup more demanding than sergeants, it was mothers. When he’d been\nyounger such attention had mortified him. After years without, he found he\ndidn’t mind a little mothering.\n“How are you?” Hesina asked.\n“Good,” he said around a spoonful of lavis.\nShe studied him.\n“Really,” he said. “Not great. Good. Worried about what’s coming.”\nA block floated past, steaming with Towerlight. Hesina tapped it with a\nhesitant finger, sending it spinning through the room. “Shouldn’t those …\nfall?”\n“Eventually, maybe?” He shrugged. “Navani has done something odd to\nthe place. It’s warm now, the pressure equalized, and the entire city is …\ninfused. Like a sphere.”\nWater flowed on command from holes in the walls, and you could\ncontrol its temperature with a gesture. Suddenly a lot of the strange basins\nand empty pools in the tower made sense; they had no controls, because\nyou activated them by speaking or touching the stone.\nSyl got Oroden twirling, then left him dizzy and with a few blocks as a\ndistraction. She popped to human size again and flopped onto her back next\nto Kaladin and Hesina, her face coated in an approximation of sweat. He\nnoticed a new detail: Syl’s havah was missing the long sleeve that would\ncover the safehand, and she wore a glove—or she’d colored her safehand\nwhite and given it a cloth texture. That wasn’t odd; Navani always wore a\nglove these days to leave both hands free. It surprised him that Syl was\nwearing one though. She’d never bothered before.\n“How do small humans keep going?” Syl said. “Where does their energy\ncome from?”"

No human woman\nwould have acted in such a … casual way in a havah. The tight dresses,\nwhile not strictly formal, weren’t designed for rolling around on the ground\nbarefoot. Syl, however, would Syl.\n“Embarrassing childhood stories?” the spren said. “Go! Talk while his\nmouth is full of food and he can’t interrupt you!”\n“He never stopped moving,” Hesina said, leaning forward. “Except when\nhe finally collapsed at night to sleep, giving us brief hours of respite. Each\nnight, I would have to sing his favorite song and Lirin would have to chase\nhim—and he could tell if Lirin was giving a halfhearted chase, and would\ngive him an earful. It was honestly the cutest thing to see Lirin being\nscolded by a three-year-old.”\n“I could have guessed Kaladin would be tyrannical as a child,” Syl said.\n“Children are often like that, Syl,” his mother said. “Accepting only one\nanswer to any question, because nuance is difficult and confusing.”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said, scraping the last of the lavis from his bowl,\n“children. That’s a worldview that, obviously, solely afflicts children—\nnever the rest of us.”\nHis mother gave him a hug, one arm around his shoulders. The kind that\nseemed to grudgingly admit that he wasn’t a little boy anymore. “Do you\nsometimes wish the world were a simpler place?” Hesina asked him. “That\nthe easy answers of childhood were, in truth, the actual answers?”\n“Not anymore,” he said. “Because I think the easy answers would\ncondemn me. Condemn everyone, in fact.”\nThat made his mother beam, even though it was an easy thing to say.\nThen Hesina’s eyes got a mischievous sparkle to them. Oh, storms. What\nwas she going to say now?\n“So, you have a spren friend,” she said. “Did you ever ask her that vital\nquestion you always asked when you were little?”\nHe sighed, bracing himself. “And which question would that be,\nMother?”\n“Dungspren,” she said, poking him. “You were always so fascinated by\nthe idea.”\n“That was Tien!” Kaladin said. “Not me.”\nHesina gave him a knowing stare. Mothers. They remembered too well.\nShamespren popped into existence around him, like red and white petals.\nOnly a few, but still.\n“Fine,” he said. “Maybe I was … intrigued.” He glanced at Syl, who was\nwatching the exchange with wide eyes. “Did you … ever know any?”\n“Dungspren,” she said flatly. “You’re asking the sole living Daughter of\nStorms—basically a princess by human terminology—this question.

He patted Kaladin on the\nknee. “It’s okay, Gagadin,” he said in a comforting voice. “Poop goes in\npotty. Get a treat!”\nThis sent Syl into a fit of uproarious laughter, flopping onto her back\nagain. Kaladin gave Hesina his captain’s glare—the one that could make\nany soldier go white. Mothers, however, ignored the chain of command. So\nKaladin was saved only when his father appeared in the doorway, a large\nstack of papers under his arm. Hesina walked over to help.\n“Dalinar’s medical corps tent layouts and current operating procedures,”\nLirin explained.\n“‘Dalinar,’ eh?” she said. “A few meetings, and you’re on a first-name\nbasis with the most powerful man in the world?”\n“The boy’s attitude is contagious,” Lirin said.\n“I’m sure it has nothing to do with his upbringing,” Hesina replied.\n“We’ll instead assume that four years in the military somehow conditioned\nhim to be flippant around lighteyes.”\n“Well, I mean …” Lirin and Hesina glanced at their son.\nKaladin’s eyes were a light blue these days, never fading back to their\nproper dark brown. It didn’t help that although he was sitting, he was\nhovering an inch off the ground. Air was more comfortable than stone.\nThe two of them spread the pages out on the counter at the side of the\nroom. “It’s a mess,” Lirin said. “His entire medical system needs to be\nrebuilt from the ground up—with training in how to properly sanitize.\nApparently many of his best field medics have fallen.”\n“Many of his best in all regards have fallen,” Hesina said, scanning the\npages.\nYou have no idea, Kaladin thought. He glanced at Syl, who had sidled\nover to sit closer to him, still human size. Oroden was chasing blocks again,\nand Kaladin …\nWell, despite his tension, he let himself bask in it. Family. Peace. Syl.\nHe’d been running from disaster to disaster for so long, he’d completely\nforgotten this joy. Even eating stew with Bridge Four—precious moments\nof respite—had felt like a gasp of air when drowning. Yet here he was.\nRetired.

It was odd behavior for her, but so was her\nbeing human size.\n“Why the full size?” he asked her.\n“When we were in Shadesmar,” she said, “everyone treated me\ndifferently. I felt … more like a person. Less like a force of nature. I’m\nfinding I missed that.”\n“Do I treat you differently when you’re small?”\n“A little.”\n“Do you want me to change?”"

My whims are as inscrutable\nas they are magnanimous.”\n“You were just saying you want to be treated like a person!” he said.\n“Not a force of nature.”\n“No,” she said. “I want to decide when I’m treated like a person. That\ndoesn’t preclude me also wanting to be properly worshipped.” She smiled\ndeviously. “I’ve been thinking of all kinds of things to make Lunamor do. If\nwe ever see him again.”\nKaladin wanted to offer her some consolation, but he honestly had no\nidea if they’d ever see Rock again. This was a different shade of pain,\ndistinct from the loss of Teft, distinct from the loss of Moash—or the man\nthey’d thought Moash had been.\nThat brought the reality of the situation back to him, along with the\nstrange warnings the wind had whispered. He found himself speaking.\n“Father, what’s the battle look like currently? A ten-day deadline. Seems\nlike everyone might simply rest and wait it out?”\n“Not so, unfortunately,” Lirin said. “I’m warned to expect heavy\ncasualties in the next few days, as Dalinar anticipates the fighting will last\nright up until the deadline—in fact, he fears the enemy might push harder to\ncapture ground in the Unclaimed Hills and the Frostlands. Apparently, per\nthe agreement, whatever each side holds when the deadline arrives … that’s\nwhat they get to keep.”\nStorms. Kaladin imagined it: fierce battles over unimportant, uninhabited\nland—but which both sides wanted to hold nonetheless. His heart bled for\nthe soldiers who would die in the nine days before it all would end.\n“Is this the storm?” he whispered.\nSyl glanced at him, frowning. But he wasn’t talking to her.\nNo … that voice replied. Worse …\nWorse. He shivered.\nPlease … the wind said. Help …\n“I don’t know if I can help,” Kaladin whispered, hanging his head. “I …\ndon’t know what I have left to give.”\nI understand, it replied. If you can, come to me.\n“Where?”\nListen to the Bondsmith …\nHe frowned. The day before, Dalinar had mentioned having a duty for\nKaladin in Shinovar, involving the Herald Ishi and some “odd company.”\nKaladin had already resolved to go. So perhaps he could help.\nCome to me, the wind repeated. Please …\nThere was a highstorm tonight, and Kaladin had thought to use it—and\nthe Stormlight it offered—to get to Shinovar.

So, taking a deep breath, Kaladin\nstood and stretched.\nIt had been wonderful to spend time with his family. To remember that\npeace. But even as worn out as he was, there was work for him to do yet.\n“I’m sorry,” he said to his parents. “I’ve got to go. Dalinar wants me to\ntry to find Ishi, who has apparently gone mad. Not surprising, considering\nhow Taln and Ash are faring.”\nHis mother gave him an odd look, and it took him a moment to realize it\nwas because he was speaking so familiarly of Heralds—figures of lore and\nreligious devotion the world over. He didn’t know any of them well, but it\nfelt natural to use their names like that. He’d stopped revering people he\ndidn’t know the day Amaram branded him.\nGod or king. If they wanted his respect, they could earn it.\n“Son,” Lirin said, turning away from his many sheets of paper. From the\nway Lirin said the word, Kaladin braced himself for some kind of lecture.\nHe was unprepared for Lirin to walk over and embrace him. Awkwardly,\nas it wasn’t Lirin’s natural state to give this sort of affection. Yet the gesture\nconveyed emotions Lirin found difficult to say. That he’d been wrong. That\nperhaps Kaladin needed to find his own way.\nSo Kaladin embraced him too, and let the joyspren—like blue leaves—\nswirl up around them.\n“I wish I had fatherly advice for you,” Lirin said, “but you’ve far\noutpaced my understanding of life. So I guess, go and be yourself. Protect. I\n… I love you.”\n“Stay safe,” his mother said, giving him another side hug. “Come back\nto us.”\nHe gave her a nod, then glanced at Syl. She’d changed from a havah to a\nBridge Four uniform, trimmed in white and dark blue, with her hair in a\nponytail like Lyn usually wore. It was strange on Syl—made her look older.\nShe’d never truly been childlike, despite her sometimes mischievous nature\n—and her chosen figure had always been that of a young, but adult, woman.\nGirlish at times, but never a girl. In uniform, with her hair up and wearing\nthat glove on her safehand, she seemed more mature.\nIt was time to go. With a final hug for his brother, Kaladin strode out to\nmeet his destiny, feeling like he was in control for the first time in years.\nDeciding to take the next step, rather than being thrust into it by momentum\nor crisis.\nAnd while he’d woken up feeling good, that knowledge—that sense of\nvolition—felt great.\nThe Wind told me, before she vanished, that it was the change in\nOdium’s vessel that restored her voice. I wonder. Perhaps it is the\nnew storm, making people begin to reconsider that the wind is not\ntheir enemy.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 3\nShallan and Pattern left Testament to rest and crossed the wall at Lasting\nIntegrity to meet with Adolin, Maya, and the Herald Kelek—who were"

Other than them, the wall top was empty today.\n“You don’t remember?” Pattern asked softly as he and Shallan walked.\n“The events with Testament? I thought you did. I thought, with Veil gone\n…”\n“Veil is not gone,” Shallan said. “She’s part of me, like she always was.”\n“I … don’t understand.”\n“It’s hard to explain,” Shallan said. “And … I’m not sure I’ve entirely\nfigured it out. Healing is not an event, Pattern, but a process. I’ve\nincorporated Veil into myself, so she doesn’t take control any longer, but\nshe’s not gone. Veil is me, but Veil is not always Shallan.”\n“But … you are Shallan …”\n“Imagine it as Veil moving to the back of the wagon as we ride toward\nthe future. She’s still there, coaching me, and we’re both aware of the\nworld.”\nThere was more to it than that, of course. Shallan had projected some\nuncomfortable aspects of herself onto Veil. Now she had to face them.\nShe’d worried that Adolin would find it difficult, but … well, Adolin Kholin\nwas storming wonderful. After their discussion last night, he seemed to\nunderstand. Together they knew that there was work to do, but Shallan had\ntaken an enormous step toward healing—and along with it, had\nacknowledged something important.\nShe didn’t deserve hatred, but understanding. It was hard to believe, but\nVeil insisted they try anyway.\n“But …” Pattern said. “Radiant is still … separate?”\n“More separate,” Shallan said.\n“Mmmmm. So … still in the front of the wagon.”\n“Yes. That might change. It might not need to change. I’m figuring this\nout as I go, Pattern, but I feel better. More importantly, I no longer need Veil\nto stand between me and the memories.”\n“So you do remember.”\n“Yes and no,” Shallan said. “It’s a jumble. I was young, the events were\ntraumatic, and there is so much pain associated with memories of my\nmother. I need time to process.”\n“Mmmm. Humans are … squishy. Not just bodies. Minds too. Memories\ntoo. Ideas too. Mmmm …” He sounded pleased by that.\nAs a child, she’d bonded a spren, something her mother had … had not\nliked. A man had come, either to hurt Shallan or to separate her from\nTestament. Her father had fought him, and during their struggle Shallan’s\nmother had come at her with a knife. In self-defense, Shallan had killed her\nmother with an early manifestation of Testament as a Shardblade.\nShallan, in trauma, had rejected her nascent oaths and buried those\nmemories.

And the memories of the days between her mother’s\ndeath and the arrival of Pattern … which of those involved Testament?\nI knew I had a Shardblade … long before I’d bonded Pattern. She’d\nconvinced herself that the weapon belonged to her father, and had been kept\nin his safe. She’d gone there before leaving home, and had drawn it out to\ndismiss it—ignoring that she’d instantly summoned it when reaching her\nhand in—pretending it was an ordinary Blade, pretending she needed ten\nheartbeats to summon it. However, a part of her had known even then that it\nwas Testament, a friend to whom she’d done great harm. That was the one\nthing Shallan clearly remembered. Testament was her friend. A dimpled\npattern on the wall that had delighted, then engaged, then protected a young\ngirl.\nTestament had never been as talkative as Pattern. Indeed, Shallan could\nonly remember rare, soft fragments of speech, encouraging her to stand\nagainst the darkness in her family. Shallan had loved her mysterious spren\ndearly; though her memories were jumbled, the emotions shone through the\npain. Strength could be a matter of perception sometimes. And today\nShallan found she could choose strength.\nThey approached Adolin, Maya, and Kelek. Shallan still found it\nincredible this man was one of the Heralds of the Almighty. The short,\nbalding fellow kept rubbing his hands together, as if washing them in\ninvisible soap and water. Adolin and Maya practically towered over him as\nthey talked to the ball of light.\nMaya was obviously paying attention. She wasn’t completely healed—\nher eyes were scratched out and her coloring was a wan brown instead of\nvibrant green like others of her kind—but she was getting better. She no\nlonger wandered off or just stared blankly during conversations. She was\nalso starting to talk more and more.\n“I worry about what is to come,” the ball of light was saying. It had\ntransformed into an approximation of Wit’s face made of soft blue-white\nlight, and spoke with his voice. The spren was a way to contact him, as\nthey’d discovered a few days ago. “The war is set to intensify, and all rests\nupon the contest of champions. Odium’s chosen warrior versus whoever old\nDalinar chooses.”\n“Father will choose himself,” Adolin said. “When the Blackthorn needs\nto be certain something is done right, he will do it himself.” Adolin paused,\nthen glanced at Maya. “Storm him. He probably is our best chance though.”\n“Wit?” Shallan said. “It’s really happening?”\n“It is indeed,” he said. “The contest is set, contracts agreed to. Shallan,\nthey’ve set it for nine days from now.”\n“So soon?” Shallan asked. Storms. “Where?”\n“Urithiru,” Adolin said, his arms folded. “They’ve already sent\nWindrunners to fetch us. Should arrive today.”\nShallan chewed on that, trying not to feel emotional whiplash. It had\ntaken weeks to reach Lasting Integrity—but Windrunners could fly them"

It had\ntaken weeks to reach Lasting Integrity—but Windrunners could fly them\nback to Urithiru within the day, depending on how much Stormlight they\nbrought.\nShe found herself eager to return. She’d had enough of the honorspren\nand their elitism. She missed blue skies and plants that didn’t crinkle when\nyou touched them. Though Shadesmar had a sun, it was distant and cold.\nShe could never thrive here.\nPlus, as she’d indicated to Testament, she had work to do.\n“Wit,” Shallan said, stepping closer. The glowing version of his face\nfocused on her. “My brothers are safe? You’re certain?”\n“Very certain, brilliant one,” he said back, softly. “You’re sure the\nGhostbloods will move against you?”\n“Yes,” she said. After a year and a half of flirting with the Ghostbloods,\nshe’d at last stepped up and said no. Doing so had essentially declared war\non them. She found Adolin’s hand for support. He knew the entire story\nnow. “Wit, I know their faces, their plans … I’m likely the greatest threat on\nthe planet to their organization, and they tried to kill Jasnah for less.\nEveryone I love is in danger.”\n“I have to manage Dalinar and try to prepare him,” Wit said, “but I think\nI can help you as well. I’ve been watching Mraize’s little crew; I’ll send\nyour people my drawings of their members. But take care, Shallan. I know\nthis group and their leader. They can be brutal.”\n“As can I,” Shallan whispered. She glanced at Kelek, who was staring\nout over the bead ocean and the deadeyed spren who remained on the shore.\nDespite him, she felt safe here with Pattern, Adolin, and Maya. Safe enough\nto voice it. “Wit, I’m worried. Am I ready?”\n“I ask myself that same question now and then,” he said. “And Shallan,\nI’m ten thousand years old.”\n“During the trip,” she said, “I started to create a new persona. Formless.\nA … version of me, but …” How did she explain it? “A version of me with\nno face. A version of me who could do terrible things. I walked away from\nit, Wit, but that capacity is still inside me.”\n“Shallan,” he said, and she looked up, meeting his eyes. “If it weren’t for\nthat capacity, then what good would choices be? If we never had the power\nto do terrible things, then what heroism would it be to resist?”\n“But …”\n“Did you turn away?” he asked, and Adolin squeezed her shoulder.\n“Yes.”\n“Then heroism it is, Shallan.”\n“I’m remembering what I did to my mother,” she said. “And my father.\nAnd to a lesser extent Tyn. Now Mraize … I’m going to have to kill him,\nWit. Is that my destiny? To kill every person who ever mentored me?”\nIn that, finally, her fears found voice. Did it sound silly, foolish,\nridiculous? This pattern she’d seen in her life? Wit did not laugh though,"

Wit did not laugh though,\nand he considered himself an expert on what was ridiculous.\n“Would that any of us,” he said, “could protect ourselves from the costs\nheroism often requires. But again, if there were no cost, no sacrifice, then\nwould it be heroism at all? I cannot promise you that it will be easy, but\nShallan, I’m proud of you.”\nI’m proud of you, Radiant whispered.\nI’m proud of you, Veil—the part of her that was Veil—agreed.\n“Thank you,” she said.\n“I have to go,” Wit said. “But I’ll leave you with this. The Ghostbloods\nwant something extremely valuable, and you have the key to it standing\nwith you right now. If you want to destroy them, you might not need to kill\nevery last one of them. Instead, you might simply need powerful leverage\n…”\nThe glowing spren shifted from his face back to a sphere. “He’s gone,”\nthe spren said. “I’m sorry.”\nHis final words lingered with Shallan, reinforcing something she’d been\nconsidering. A way to protect Roshar from the Ghostbloods—and indeed,\nshe knew what their next target was likely to be. They’d sent her to Lasting\nIntegrity hunting the Herald who stood next to her—and Kelek believed\nthat the secret they truly sought was his knowledge of one of the Unmade.\n“I need,” she said to Kelek, “to know everything you know about Ba-\nAdo-Mishram.”\nThe Herald wrung his hands, then looked to the side as if seeking escape.\n“We’re not going to hurt you,” Adolin said calmly. “You know that by\nnow.”\n“I do,” Kelek said. “It’s just … I wasn’t supposed to be involved. None\nof us are.”\n“I don’t think the other Heralds follow that,” Shallan noted, folding her\narms. “What did you do, Kelek?”\n“Not much,” he said, putting his hand to his head. “I … I can’t do much\nthese days. I don’t know why. I can’t decide. I … I …” He looked up at\nthem, then formed fists, pulling them close to his chest. “I was at Urithiru\nwhen the plan to capture Mishram was conceived. Then … I joined them on\ntheir mission. I’m … I guess I’m the only one alive who actually knows\nwhat happened to her. That’s why the Ghostbloods, and their cursed Lord of\nScars, want me.”\n“Just tell us,” Shallan said.\n“Some of us learned you could capture spren in gemstones,” he\nexplained. “And Mishram—for all her power—is a spren. The Radiants\nprepared a flawless heliodor the color of sunlight, and they trapped her\ninside, then hid her prison. Not in the Physical Realm, and not in\nShadesmar.” He bit his lip, then forced out another part. “In the Spiritual\nRealm. Melishi hid it there.”\n“How?” Shallan asked, sharing a glance with Adolin.\n“I don’t know,” Kelek said, backing away. “I promise you, I don’t know."

They’ll trap\nme in a gemstone, or they think they’ll be able to …” He looked to the two\nof them, wide-eyed, then fled toward the way down. None of them gave\nchase. Unfortunately, this behavior was usual for Kelek.\nMaya grunted softly, watching him go. “He’s gotten a lot worse.”\nShallan started. “You knew him?”\n“Met him a few times,” Maya said, then took a deep breath. “Never …\nnever thought much of him, even then.”\n“Well,” Shallan said, “at least we know something more about Mishram.\nI suspect her prison is part of what Mraize has been hunting for a long time\nnow. I might need to find it first, before he can.”\n“Ba-Ado-Mishram,” Adolin said, thoughtful, leaning back against the\nwall’s battlements. “The most powerful of the Unmade. What would the\nGhostbloods want with her?”\n“Mmm …” Pattern said. “Power. So much power. She was nearly a god.\nShe bonded the singers once. Could Mraize want to do something similar\nagain?”\nShallan shivered as she contemplated Mraize and his master, Iyatil,\nsomehow commanding the entirety of the enemy army. Was that possible?\n“Whatever the reason,” Shallan said, “I have to stop him.”\n“Her prison is in the Spiritual Realm though?” Adolin said, frowning.\n“What does that even mean?”\n“Mmm …” Pattern said. “It means we will never be able to find it.”\n“Surely it’s possible,” Shallan said. “If the ancient Radiants put it there,\nwe should be able to take it out.”\n“You don’t understand,” Pattern said, holding his hands apart and\ngesturing in his way. “You think Shadesmar is odd, yes? Black sky. Little\nsun. Pattern, with arms and legs for perambulating!” His head pattern spun\nfaster. “The Spiritual Realm is stranger by orders of magnitude. It is a place\nwhere the future blends with the present, where the past echoes like the\nstriking of a clock. Time and distance stretch, like numbers infinitely\nrepeating. It is where the gods live, and it baffles even some of them.”\nShallan took that in, then glanced at Testament, huddled in the shadow of\nthe wall farther back along the walk. “Our best guess,” she said, “is that the\ndeadeyes were created because Mishram was imprisoned, right?”\n“Agreed,” Pattern said. “Mishram became like a god to the singers—the\nparshmen. She Connected to Roshar, and echoes of that filtered to the\nspren! Ah, so wonderfully odd. Her imprisonment is the reason broken\nbonds now have such an effect on the spren.”\n“It is because …” Maya said, “… humans have no Honor. The god, I\nmean. I heard … I heard that Mishram had been captured. I heard that …\nthat Radiants would destroy the world. That was why I decided. Decided I"

Considering\nwhat breaking … breaking the bond did to me.”\nThat day—the day Mishram had been captured—something deeper had\nhappened. An event connecting humankind, Honor, spren, and the bonds.\n“Then we need to figure out how Mishram, or her imprisonment, has\npower over our bonds,” Shallan said, looking to Pattern. “We need to go to\nthe Spiritual Realm and find that prison, however difficult it is.”\nHis pattern slowed, then finally he laced his fingers together. “Very well.\nThough, you know when I said I was sure you wouldn’t get me killed?”\n“Yes?”\n“I should like,” he declared, “to make a retraction.”\nI have read that in the ancient days, the Wind often spoke to both\nhuman and singer.

Blood that hadn’t been entirely scrubbed away. Broken banisters on\nbalconies. That reminded him of another time he’d flown up this corridor\n… just after Teft’s murder. Dark, poisoned rage building within—the\nfeeling a fraternal twin to the normal excitement of holding Stormlight.\nThat man he’d become after killing the Pursuer … that man frightened\nKaladin. Even now, lit by calm sunlight. Remembering that man was like\nremembering a nightmare, and it caused painspren—like little severed\nhands—to appear on the balconies he passed, leaping off toward him.\nHe banished those feelings as he landed on a floor near the top of\nUrithiru. As he alighted in the central chamber where the lifts deposited\npeople, he noted a glow coming from a nearby room.\n“Navani,” Syl whispered, her eyes wide. She went light blue, shrank\ndown to spren size, and zipped off in that direction. There was something\nalmost intoxicating about Navani—and her bond with the Sibling—to spren\nin the tower city. Syl would be back shortly.\nKaladin forced himself to walk, not glide, over to Dalinar’s meeting\nroom. As soon as he left Urithiru, Kaladin would have to return to using\nStormlight only when necessary. Best to get into the habit now. As he\nwalked, the wind blew behind him, somehow present all the way within the\nstructure, carrying with it his armor spren as ribbons of light. He didn’t hear\nthe wind’s voice, but it urged him forward, and its warnings echoed in his\nmind.\nThere was a small waiting room outside Dalinar’s meeting room.\nUrithiru had more and more furniture these days, including a couch here.

Let’s see how you screw it up.”\n“Wit?” Kaladin said. “I didn’t realize you were back in the tower.” It was\nprobably a stupid thing to say. Jasnah was here, so it made sense Wit had\ncome along.\nWit, being Wit, finished his page before acknowledging Kaladin. At last\nthe lanky man snapped the book closed, then sat up and lounged on the sofa\na different way, arms spread across the back, one leg crossed on the other,\nlooking like nothing so much as a king on his throne. A very relaxed king\non a rather cushy throne.\n“Well,” Wit said, his eyes alight with amusement, “if it isn’t my favorite\nflute thief.”\n“You gave that flute to me, Wit,” Kaladin said, sighing as he leaned on\nthe doorframe.\n“Then you lost it.”\n“I found it again.”\n“Still lost it.”\n“That’s not the same as stealing.”\n“I’m a storyteller,” Wit said, with a flip of his fingers. “I have the right to\nredefine words.”\n“That’s stupid.”\n“That’s literature.”\n“It’s confusing.”\n“The more confusing, the better the literature.”\n“That might be the most pretentious thing I’ve ever heard.”\n“Aha!” Wit said, pointing. “Now you’re getting it.”\nKaladin hesitated. Sometimes during conversations with Wit, he wished\nhe had someone to take notes for him. “So …” Kaladin said. “Do you want\nyour flute back?”\n“Hell no. I gave that to you, bridgeboy. Returning it would be almost as\ninsulting as losing it!”\n“Then what am I supposed to do with it?”\n“Hmmm …” Wit said, reaching into a bag at his feet and slipping out a\ndifferent flute, this one painted with a shiny red lacquer. He twirled it in his\nhand. “If only there were something we could do with these curious pieces\nof wood? They have holes that seem intended for some arcane purpose,\nbeyond the understanding of mere mortals.”\nKaladin rolled his eyes.\n“If only,” Wit continued, “there were a way to learn to do something\nproductive with this item. It has the look of a tool. Nay, an instrument! Of\nmythical design. Alas. My poor finite mind is incapable of comprehending\nthe—”\n“If I don’t interrupt,” Kaladin said, “how long will you keep going?”\n“Long, long past when it was funny.”\n“It was funny?”\n“The words?” Wit said. “Of course not. Your face while I say them\nthough? Well, it’s been said I am an artist. Unfortunately, the primary\nsubjects of my art can never experience my creations, as displayed upon\ntheir features.” He flipped the flute, then held it out to Kaladin. “Give it a\ntry.

Dalinar’s meetings often overran, despite the many\nclocks Navani had given him.\nKaladin felt an urgency to get to Shinovar, but if he wanted to fly all that\nway without using up a large sack of gemstones—which would be needed\nin the battle to come—he had to fly with the highstorm, hours away yet. So\nhe had time. And … well, Kaladin felt indebted to Wit.

So, he\nplayed the role Wit obviously wanted. “Would you teach me?” Kaladin\nsaid, taking the flute. “I don’t have a lot of time, but—”\nWit was already moving, whipping some sheets of paper from the bag by\nhis feet. He waved for his strange ball spren to go away, and Kaladin’s\nwindspren followed, flitting out of the room as Kaladin glanced over the\npages. They had odd symbols on them, which made Kaladin nervous, but\nWit insisted it wasn’t actual writing. Merely marks on a paper representing\nsounds. It took Kaladin a few minutes to realize the joke.\nStill, over the next hour—Dalinar was really taking his time—Kaladin\nfollowed Wit’s instructions. He learned the basics of fingering, of reading\nmusic, and—hardest of all—how to hold the thing and blow into it properly.\nAt the end of the hour, Kaladin was able to force out a stumbling\nrendition of the first line of the music, with notes that sounded breathy and\nweak in comparison to Wit’s playing. It was an incredibly simple\naccomplishment, and he didn’t attract a single musicspren, yet Kaladin felt\nhe’d climbed a mountain. He was smiling in a stupid way as Syl, full sized\nand wearing a havah with purple trim, peeked in to investigate.\nBased on the sounds I’m making, she’s probably come to see who’s\nstepping on a rat, Kaladin thought.\n“Nice work,” Wit said. “Next fight, start up a bit of that. Surely the\nenemy will drop their weapons … probably just to cover their ears.”\n“If anyone asks about my skill, I’ll be sure to tell them who my teacher\nis.”\nWit grinned.\n“I know that song,” Syl said, folding her arms.\n“Wit played it for us on the Shattered Plains,” Kaladin said. “Back when\nwe first met him. The story of the Wandersail.”\n“I know it better than that though …” she said."

The story of the Wandersail.”\n“I know it better than that though …” she said.\n“Long ago,” Wit said softly, “that rhythm guided humans across the void\nfrom one planet to the other. They followed it to reach your world.”\n“One of the rhythms of Roshar,” Syl said with a nod. “Made into a song,\nwith the tones of the gods.”\n“Gods older than yours,” Wit said from beside Kaladin on the couch.\n“When you first played for us,” Kaladin said, remembering that lonely\nnight on the plateaus when he’d still been a bridgeman, “I could swear the\nsound … came back. You’d play, then talk, and the song would continue to\necho. How did you do that?”\n“I didn’t,” Wit said.\n“But—”\n“Ask yourself who was listening that night.”\n“Me. Syl. You, presumably.”\n“And?”\n“And … some guards in the distance?”\nWit shook his head. “Storms, how can you be from this land, yet be so\ndense. It—”\n“The wind,” Kaladin guessed. “The wind was listening.”\nWit smiled. “Maybe you can be salvaged after all.”\n“Is the wind a god?” Kaladin asked.\n“When this world was created,” Wit said, “long before Honor,\nCultivation, or Odium arrived, Adonalsium left something behind on it.\nSometimes it’s called the Old Magic. That term is often applied to the\nNightwatcher, who came—with Cultivation’s efforts—from one of those\nancient spren. Listen to the Wind when it speaks, Kaladin. It’s weaker than\nit once was, but it has seen so very much.”\n“It … told me a storm was coming,” Kaladin said. “And asked for help.”\n“Then listen,” Wit said. “And the Wind … she will listen to you in\nreturn.” He winked. “That’s all I’ll say about it. I’m not one to give away\nanother’s secrets.”\nLovely. Well, he’d done as Wit asked, so he returned the flute. Would\nDalinar ever be finished? “It was a fun way to pass the time, Wit, but I have\nto ask. Music? What relevance does it have for someone like me?”\n“Ah, now there’s a question for the ages,” Wit said, leaning back. “What\nuse is art? Why does it hold such meaning and potency? I can’t tell you,\nbecause the short answer is unappealing and the long answer takes months.\nI will instead say this: every society in every region of every planet I’ve\nvisited—and I’ve been to quite a large number—has made art.”\nKaladin nodded thoughtfully. Wit hadn’t answered his question, but he\nwas accustomed to that. Protesting would only lead to mockery.\n“Perhaps the question isn’t ‘What use is art?’” Wit mused. “Perhaps even\nthat simple question misses the point. It’s like asking the use of having\nhands, or walking upright, or growing hair. Art is part of us, Kaladin. That’s\nthe use; that’s the reason. It exists because on some fundamental level we\nneed it. Art exists to be made.”"

Art exists to be made.”\nWhen Kaladin didn’t respond, Wit eyed him.\n“I can accept that,” Kaladin said. “As an explanation.”\n“It’s a tautology.”\n“The more confusing the better, right?”\nWit grinned, and then it faded. He glanced at the door.\n“Wit,” Kaladin said. “The Wind asked for help. And Dalinar is worried\nabout the coming battle. I get the feeling this next part is going to be\ndifficult.”\n“Yeah,” Wit said softly. “I feel it too.”\nA straight answer. Those were always disturbing.\n“Do you have any … words of wisdom?” Kaladin asked. “A story,\nmaybe?”\n“Listen,” Wit said. “Everything you’ve done—Kal, everything you’ve\nbeen—has prepared you for what’s next. It’s going to be hard. Fortunately,\nlife has been hard, so you’re working under familiar constraints.”\nKaladin glanced to the side, where Wit was staring off into space, idly\nspinning the red flute in his fingers. Something in his voice … his face …\n“You’re talking,” Kaladin said softly, “as if one of us won’t survive\nthis.”\n“I wish I were optimistic enough to think one of us will survive.”\n“Wit, I’m pretty sure I’ve heard you say you’re immortal.”\n“Immortality doesn’t seem to go as far as it once did, kid.” He glanced at\nKaladin. “Listen, if the Wind wants your help … well, I think you can rise\nto what is coming. Probably. Difficult though it will be.”\n“Storms,” Syl said, walking forward. “I’m … not sure I like it when he’s\nserious, Kaladin.”\n“Dalinar is going to send you to Shinovar,” Wit said, “because he hopes\nIshar can help with the contest of champions. Ishar can’t help, not like that,\nbut you still need to go.”\n“Why?” Kaladin asked. “Why go if I can’t do what I’m sent to do?”\n“Because this is the journey, Kaladin,” Wit said softly. “The last part of\nit. Listen to me: I want you to practice with that flute until you make the\nsound return to you. Because that will mean Roshar is listening.”\nWhat did that even mean? “I think you’ve been reading too many stories,\nWit. Riddles aren’t actually helpful.”\nWit launched himself off the couch and crossed the room on legs that\nsuddenly seemed spindly. “The problem is, I don’t actually know what the\nnext part will entail. I have hints and thoughts, but mostly just worries. All I\ncan do is point you toward what might be the correct path. That and keep\nyour hope strong.”\n“Jasnah doesn’t believe in hope,” Syl whispered, stepping over by\nKaladin. “I heard her complaining about it once.”\n“Jasnah would make an excellent Wit,” Wit said, pointing at Syl. “She’s\nthe right combination of smart and stupid all at once.” He smiled in a fond\nway, and Kaladin thought the rumors about them must be true."

I’ve been waiting for\nthe truth to come crashing down. I don’t know what to do or who to pray to,\nsince the only true God I’ve known is the one we rejected and killed. So\nI’m sending you off, Kaladin. Hoping that if the Wind spoke to you, then\nsome piece of that ancient deity is watching. Because when everything feels\nwrong, all I can do is hope.”\n“The Passions,” Syl whispered.\n“Isn’t that some old Thaylen religion?” Kaladin said. “Something about\nemotion?”\n“Derived, anciently, from the teachings of Odium,” Wit said. “Though\nit’s not polite to point that out to practitioners of the Passions. People don’t\nlike hearing that their religion was mythologized, as if myth can’t be true.\nRegardless, Ancient Daughter, I’d think better of you than to bring up the\nPassions.”\n“Why?” she said. “Human religions are all a little silly, aren’t they?”\n“Yes,” Wit said, “but the Passions teach that if you are fervent enough—\nif you care enough—your emotion will influence your success. That if you\nwant something badly enough, the cosmere will provide it for you.”\nKaladin nodded slowly. “There might be something to that.”\n“Kid,” Wit said, leaning down over Kaladin on the couch, “the Passions\nare absolute horseshit.”\n“What? It’s good to be hopeful! The Passions sound nice.”\n“The wrong people get far too much mileage out of things that sound\nnice,” Wit said. “Take it from a guy who is all too capable with a lie:\nnothing is easier to sell someone than the story they want to hear. The\nPassions are deeply insulting if you spare even a moment to consider. I once\nspoon-fed broth to a trembling child in a kingdom that no longer exists. I\nfound her on a road leading away from a battlefield, after her parents—\nsimple peasants—were slaughtered. Her elder brother lay dead a half mile\nbehind, having starved.\n“You think that kid who starved didn’t want to eat? You think her parents\ndidn’t want to escape the ravages of war badly enough? You think if they’d\nhad more Passion, the cosmere would have saved them? How convenient to\nbelieve that people are poor because they didn’t care enough about being\nrich. That they just didn’t pray hard enough. So convenient to make\nsuffering their own fault, rather than life being unfair and birth mattering\nmore than aptitude. Or storming Passion.”\nHe raised his finger at that last word, and angerspren burst around his\nfeet like pools of boiling blood, as if on cue. Kaladin didn’t know if he’d\never seen Wit so riled up, particularly by something that had nothing to do\nwith their conversation. Though one could never tell with Wit.

Non\nsequiturs that ended up relevant were the daggers he kept strapped to his\nboots, to be employed when his foes were distracted.\n“We need hope, Kaladin,” Wit said, leaning farther forward. “We’re\nheading straight toward what may be the most difficult moment in our lives.\nSo remember: Hope is wonderful. Keep it, treasure it. Hope is a virtue—but\nthe definition of that word is crucial. You want to know what a virtue truly\nis? It’s not that difficult.”\n“If this entire conversation is the way I learn,” Kaladin said, “then I\ndispute the idea of it not being difficult.”\nWit chuckled, then stepped back and threw his hands up, angerspren\nvanishing and gloryspren—tiny spheres of golden light—bursting around\nhim. “A virtue is something that is valuable even if it gives you nothing. A\nvirtue persists without payment or compensation. Positive thinking is great.\nVital. Useful. But it has to remain so even if it gets you nothing. Belief,\ntruth, honor … if these exist only to get you something, you’ve missed the\nstorming point.”\nHe glanced at Syl. “This is where Jasnah is wrong about hope, smart\nthough she is in so many ways. If hope doesn’t mean anything to you when\nyou lose, then it wasn’t ever a virtue in the first place. It took me a long\ntime to learn that, and I finally did so from the writings of a man who lost\nevery belief he thought he had, then started over new.”\n“Sounds like someone wise,” Syl said.\n“Oh, Sazed is among the best. Hope I get to meet him someday.”\n“When you do,” Kaladin said, “maybe some of his wisdom will rub off.”\nWit tossed his flute, spinning it, then pointed it directly at Kaladin.\n“Congratulations. You’ve practiced music, you’ve listened to a self-\nimportant rant, and you’ve delivered quips at awkward points. I dub you\ngraduated from Wit’s school of practical impracticality.”\nSyl sat on the couch, though she left no impression in its cushions. She\nlooked completely baffled.\n“Wait,” Kaladin said. “Does that make me … your apprentice?”\nWit belted out a loud, full belly laugh, long enough to be uncomfortable.\n“Kal,” he said, gasping for breath, “you’re still far, far too useful a human\nbeing to be an apprentice of mine. You’d end up actually helping people!\nNo, I’ve already had one bridgeboy as an apprentice, and graduated or not,\nhe’s incompetent enough to hold on to the position.”\n“I’ll have you know,” Kaladin said, “that Sig is doing a fine job leading\nthe Windrunners.”\n“You’ve been corrupting him,” Wit said. “No, you’re not my apprentice,\nbut that doesn’t mean you can’t learn a thing or two.

I want you to march off to your divine\ndestiny with a spring in your step.”\n“I don’t know what I’m going to do though,” Kaladin said. “War is\ncoming, but I’m not involved. I’m just going to help a maniac return to his\nsenses.”\n“That’s it, eh?” Wit said. “Just you becoming your world’s first\ntherapist.”\nKaladin glanced at Syl, who shook her head. “We have no idea what that\nis, Wit.”\n“Because,” Wit said, “you haven’t finished inventing it yet.” He leaned\nin. “About time someone figured out a method to counteract what I’ve been\ndoing. Now, practice that flute. Get Roshar to listen. Help Ishar. But know\nthat you’re not coming back to aid Dalinar, whatever he thinks.”\n“Practice the flute,” Syl said. “Get Roshar to listen to us. Help Ishar.\nDon’t come back.”\n“Exactly,” Wit said. “Now go. The world needs the two of you—more\nthan you, or it, or anyone other than your humble Wit yet realizes. The fight\nahead of you will be legendary. Unfortunately, you can’t fight this one with\nstrength of muscle. You’ll have to wield the spear another way. Good luck.”\nWith a sigh, Kaladin stood up. Then the most remarkable thing\nhappened. Wit extended his hand, and didn’t pull back as Kaladin hesitantly\ntook it. Wit gave a firm shake.\n“You know what first drew me to you, Kaladin?” Wit asked. “You did\none of the most difficult things a man can do: you gave yourself a second\nchance.”\n“I took that second chance … maybe a third,” Kaladin admitted. “But\nnow what? Who am I without the spear?”\n“Won’t it be exciting to find out?” Wit said. “Have you ever wondered\nwho you would be if there was no one you needed to save, no one you\nneeded to kill? You’ve lived for others for so long, Kaladin. What happens\nwhen you try living for you?” Wit held up his finger. “I know you can’t\nanswer yet. Go and find out.” With that, Wit bowed to him. “Thank you.”\n“For what?” Kaladin asked.\n“For the inspiration,” Wit said, straightening and looking to Kaladin,\nthen to Syl, then smiling in a fond, yet somehow regretful way.\nKaladin felt a chill. “I’m … never going to see you again, am I, Wit?”\n“No one knows the future, Kal,” he replied. “Not even me. So instead of\nsaying goodbye, let’s call this … an extended period of necessary\nseparation, requisite to give me time to think of the most perfect, exquisite\ninsult. If I never get to deliver it in person … well, kindly do me the favor\nof imagining how wonderful it was.

They glanced at\neach other.\n“Wit,” Kaladin called just before the man vanished. “What about my\nstory?”\n“You will tell your own story this time, Kaladin!” Wit said. “And if\nyou’re lucky, the Wind will join in.” Then he was gone, his last whistle\nslowly fading.\n“Did you ever think,” Kaladin said to Dalinar, “that you’d end up\ndancing to that man’s whims?”\n“I suspect,” Dalinar said, stepping back and waving for Kaladin to enter,\n“we’ve been dancing to them for years without knowing it. Come. I have a\nfew things to tell you two before you leave.”\nAs a historian, I find such nuances relevant. As a philosopher, I\nfind them enticing.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 4\nIt was nice for Shallan to take a few hours and think for once. Sitting,\nwearing a bright blue havah rather than her traveling clothing, on the top\nrow of the stone open-air forum in Lasting Integrity, drawing. How long\nhad it been since she’d simply let herself draw? She’d sketched a little\nduring their trip, but that felt like an eternity ago.\nShe relaxed, flowing with the drawing: a depiction of the vertigo she felt\nlooking up along one of the interior walls of Lasting Integrity. A surreal\nimage like something from one of the older art movements, where\nperspective was intentionally alien and off-putting. She liked to think that\nthe old surrealists had made contact with spren and Shadesmar, warping\ntheir minds to new ways of seeing things.\nThough she’d never been as good with landscapes as she was with\npeople, she was proud of the sense her sketch gave of falling—yet into what\nyou could not see, because the unnatural perspective drew your eyes\nupward.\nAs with others she’d done today though, strange faces kept sneaking into\nthe art.\nIn this case, she’d absently warped the shadings of one wall into a face.\nFeminine, a singer with a crownlike carapace and shadows and curves\nforming a stratalike design on her face. Shallan flipped through the\nsketchbook. Each drawing done today had that singer face hidden\nsomewhere, and she didn’t remember making them.\nShe’d done something similar at Urithiru, where the presence of an\nUnmade had warped her sketches. She tried not to let it disturb her quite so\nmuch this time. Then, it had been a message. Was there a similar one now?\nShe looked toward Adolin, who paced at the center of the forum—the\nplace where only a few days before, he’d been on trial. Today he’d been\njoined by Godeke, a lanky Edgedancer. Shallan’s agents had joined them as\nwell: Ishnah, Vathah, and Beryl, along with their Cryptics. Together they"

Together they\nwaited for the Windrunners, and for the fruits of some final efforts in\nLasting Integrity. She started another sketch as they waited.\nIn the end, twelve arrived.\nTwelve honorspren, from a population of hundreds. That was how many\nshowed up in response to Adolin’s call to arms. He and Godeke greeted\neach one with a smile, but she knew he’d expected more. One other did\narrive: Notum. The former sea captain sported his unique facial hair as\nalways, though he walked on unsteady feet. They still didn’t know why\nhe’d been assaulted by those Tukari that Adolin had saved him from.\nNotum didn’t join Godeke and Adolin, but instead walked down the\nsteps to Shallan. “Radiant Kholin,” he said.\nThat was odd to hear, even a year after the wedding. It hadn’t been a\nforegone conclusion that she would take Adolin’s name; among the Alethi\nlighteyes, either party was equally likely to keep their name as adopt a new\none. In her case, she was needed in the line of Kholin succession. She\ndoubted she’d take a throne that Adolin had refused, but Dalinar wanted\npeople he trusted in line. Her adoption into the Kholin house would\nstrengthen her claim, should it come to that.\nIn explaining this to her, Dalinar and Navani had been speaking\npragmatically—but that wasn’t what Shallan remembered most about that\nday. For her, it was the day when a set of parents had, for the first time,\nwanted her.\nNotum settled down beside her. “Your mission was a success. Twelve\nnew Radiants.”\n“We expected more though,” Radiant said, emerging. “After the support\nAdolin got at the trial, I anticipated an excellent recruitment result.”\n“A good number of honorspren support him,” Notum said, “but that\ndoesn’t mean they want to be bonded. One can be irate at the honorspren\nleadership and think humans are deserving of support, without wanting to\ntake that step.”\nBelow, the twelve honorspren started to fade.\n“I’ve never seen this before,” Notum added. “I thought they’d go in a\nblink. Instead they fade away to nothing …”\n“Not nothing,” Radiant said. “They’ll appear on the other side.”\n“I hear it’s traumatic,” Notum said. He had a stiff, formal way of\nspeaking, even when the words were casual. Clipping each word as if he\nwere making an announcement from the quarterdeck of his ship. “Spren on\nthe other side forget themselves.”\n“Only briefly,” Radiant said. “These will probably stay in a group—\nwhich helps—and immediately make their way to Urithiru, drawn by the\nsquires training there.”\n“Do you still need them now, though?” Notum asked. “Isn’t the war soon\nto end?”\n“Windrunners are our primary method of traveling long distances—and I\nsuspect they’ll be very helpful in peacetime. Beyond that … even if Dalinar"

Beyond that … even if Dalinar\nwins the contest, I worry about what is to come next. The more Radiants we\nhave, the more stable our position will be.”\n“Then I should hurry,” Notum said, standing. “To join them, so that I’m\nnot left alone.”\nRadiant approved. But Shallan … she noticed something.\n“You sound reluctant,” Shallan said.\nHe looked at her, glowing the same soft blue as all the honorspren. His\nuniform, his hair, everything about him was made of the same light—solid,\nnot transparent, but also not quite real in the way she understood reality.\n“There is nothing more for me here,” Notum said. “I have been rejected\nof mine, and have seen their pettiness. I should like to be of service. Though\n… I admit, I do not wish to bond a human. I loathe the idea. Is that petty of\nme, in turn?”\n“Absolutely not,” Shallan said. “I have two bonds, Notum, and\nunderstand the cost better than most. It’s not pettiness, or cowardice, to be\nhesitant. Just as it’s not petty or cowardly to reject any relationship.”\n“Pardon,” Notum said, “but other sorts of relationships don’t lead to\nsoldiers with remarkable powers.”\nThat did admittedly complicate the matter. But after learning what she’d\ndone to Testament—who sat with Pattern a few rows down—Shallan\ncouldn’t help but question their mission. They needed Windrunners, yes,\nbut it made her increasingly uneasy to demand a spren bond. It wasn’t\nintimate in the traditional human sense of the word, but it felt as deeply\npersonal.\n“We can use every Windrunner, yes,” she said, “but I don’t think you\nshould force yourself to bond a human if it makes you uncomfortable. You\ncan be a good person and say no, Notum. I’ve learned that.”\n“Perhaps I will stay here a little longer then,” Notum said. “With effort, I\nmight persuade others of my kind to offer you support.” He pointed, and\ndrew her attention to a group of honorspren walking past, wearing traveling\nclothing and carrying gear. As if leaving for a long hike. They waved to\nShallan and Adolin, but did not join those fading away.\n“Objectors?” Shallan asked as Adolin waved back to them. “Those you\nmentioned earlier?”\n“Yes,” Notum said. “They don’t agree with how you were treated, but\nalso don’t want to go to war. They depart Lasting Integrity to make their\nown way.”\nShe nodded. “Well, Radiant Godeke is staying to continue to normalize\nrelations with the honorspren, and I might leave one of my agents as well. If\nyou stay, that would help—they could use a solid ally here.”\n“I am your ally,” he said, “but as I warned you, the honorspren\nleadership does not care for me, even if they have been forced to revoke my\nexile.” His expression grew distant. “We have an entire navy that once\nsailed the bead ocean; it is a shame to see those ships abandoned in the"

It gives the enemy full control of the Shadesmar seas. Perhaps I\ncould sail under honorspren authority again …”\nStorms, if Shallan hadn’t said anything, Notum might have gone to\nbecome a Radiant spren—meaning that she’d just actively gone against\ntheir orders in coming here. Perhaps she wouldn’t mention that in her report\nto Dalinar.\nNo other spren came. Lusintia, the spren who had been Shallan’s guide\nsince her arrival at Lasting Integrity, made no appearance. Shallan had\nhoped she would change her mind, despite their occasional clashes.\n“Notum, thank you,” Shallan said. “For how you stood up for us during\nthe trial.”\n“I am one person stretched thin, Radiant Kholin,” he said, standing with\nhis hands clasped behind him. “Like colors on the mast that have waved too\nlong in the wind. I don’t know what I believe or trust any longer, but what\nwas done to you was not right. I could not play the sham role they\ndemanded of me. I ask your forgiveness for even considering it.”\n“It was natural to want your old life back, Notum.”\nHe turned to her, blue eyes meeting hers. “I lay on the ground, battered\nand assaulted, and watched your husband rise in my defense against\noverwhelming odds. He saved me with no expectation of reward. In that\nmoment I knew that Honor lived.” He nodded curtly to Shallan, then\nwalked down the steps to talk with Adolin.\nShallan slowly returned to her sketch—where she soon found that she’d\ndrawn yet another face. In Adolin’s shadow. Storms.\nDon’t be unnerved, she thought. You were upset when you drew Pattern\nfor the first time, back in Kharbranth. But look how that turned out.\nShe would not be afraid of her own art. She gritted her teeth and forced\nherself to flip to the next sheet and start drawing again, until someone else\nsat beside her. Kelek leaned forward, hands clasped, seeming small and\nfragile.\n“I’m not going with you,” he said softly. “I … I can’t.”\n“It’s not safe for you here,” Shallan said, sketching, her fingers moving\nas if of their own accord. “If I got to you, Mraize’s other assassins can too.”\n“I … I will hide. Better. But I can’t leave the seon, and she can’t travel\nnow. It wouldn’t be good for her.”\nShallan didn’t argue. That never worked well with Kelek. Instead she\nlost herself in a sketch of him. A Herald to add to her collection. She might\nhave said this was the rarest of gems to obtain, but was a Herald actually\nrarer than anyone else? One might argue that due to their immortality, they\nwere less so.\n“We are broken, Shallan,” Kelek finally said. “We are not the heroes you\nwish us to be. Not anymore.”\n“I know how that feels.”\n“I don’t think you do,” he said, wrapping his arms around himself. “I"

Not anymore.”\n“I know how that feels.”\n“I don’t think you do,” he said, wrapping his arms around himself. “I\ndon’t believe anyone does.” He glanced at Adolin, chatting with Notum and\nGodeke. “You’re really going to try to find Mishram?”\n“If I don’t,” Shallan said, “my enemies will.”\n“Then what?” he said. “Will you release her? I … I cannot decide.\nAlways cannot decide. I have advocated for her freedom in the past, but\nnow I worry. She might join and strengthen Odium. She … hates humans.”\nHe put his hand to his head. “Ishar says all the Unmade should be\ncontained, yet what we did to the singers by imprisoning her …”\n“I’ll worry about that when I find her gemstone,” Shallan said.\n“Honestly, I’ll probably bring her back to the Bondsmith and let everyone\ndecide together.”\nHe didn’t respond, so she continued drawing. The familiar sound of\ncharcoal or colored pencil on paper; the distilled attention of creation, like\nthe most potent alcohol. She attracted a few creationspren, little swirling\nlights. These ones, though, behaved oddly—in here, she’d never seen them\nchange shape like they did in the Physical Realm, but these started adopting\nthe appearance of her pencil or eraser.\nShe kept drawing. Lines imitating life. Freezing it. But altering it at the\nsame time, for you could never make an exact copy. That wasn’t the point.\nEvery sketch was a picture of the artist as well: their perspective, their\nemphasis, their instinct reclaiming a moment otherwise lost …\nOnce you reached the end … it was sublime.\nThat moment when you basked in the thing you’d created—that feeling\nof awe mixed with disbelief that this beautiful object had come from you.\nAccompanied by the slightest worry that because you didn’t understand\nhow you’d done it, you maybe didn’t deserve to have been part of the\ncreation. She loved the feeling, even the uncertainty of it.\n“Radiant,” Kelek said, hands clasped as he stared at the stone floor of the\namphitheater, “what do you fear?”\nWhat kind of question was that? “I don’t know,” she lied.\n“I fear options,” he said. “I see each choice I make, and see the terrible\nresults that could stem from it. If I stay here, I see you fail without me. If I\ngo, I see my presence—broken as I am—cause your failure. I cannot\ncontinue. I … I do not …”\nShe rested her hand on his, then passed him the sketch. He took the\npicture, frowning, then his eyes widened as he saw it depicted him standing\ntall, wearing robes and striding from a fanciful city with colorful walls and\nstrange trees with long fronds she’d made up. He carried a staff with an odd\nshape at the top, and strode toward a glowing light on the horizon—though\nin the picture, he looked backward and his face was determined. Decisive.\n“Do you often do this?” he asked.\n“Sketch people?” she said, then blushed. “Yes, I kind of do it all the\ntime. When I’m feeling like myself, at least.”"

Glimpse\nsomeone’s possible selves, and pull one forth … touch, in some small way,\nwhat could have been. What might still be …” He glanced to her, and must\nhave seen the utter confusion in her eyes, as he sighed. “Is this a skill\ncommonly employed by Lightweavers during your time?”\n“Not that I know of,” she said. “But I don’t exactly understand what\nyou’re saying.”\nHe glanced toward Pattern and Testament. “Two spren. Of course …\nyou’ve bonded two. Strange things happen when the Nahel bond is\nimbricated. There were rules against it once, I believe. How long have you\nhad them both?”\n“For some time,” she said, “though I didn’t know it—didn’t remember it\n—until recently.”\n“And how often,” he asked, holding up the sheet, “do you glimpse into\nthe Spiritual Realm, then manifest it in your art?”\n“I …” She thought back to pictures she’d done, like one found in the\npocket of a dead man. Like sketches of the Unmade lurking in Urithiru …\nor faces turning up in her art without her intending to draw them. She began\nto feel like a fool for objecting so quickly to someone who clearly knew far\nmore about these things than she did.\n“It might happen now and then,” she said. “There was an Unmade in\nUrithiru, and it showed up in my art. Now these faces …” She turned one\ntoward him.\nHe nodded. “Because you’ve been thinking about traveling to the\nSpiritual Realm and finding Ba-Ado-Mishram.”\n“That’s her?”\n“One interpretation of her, yes,” he said. “If you were someone else, I\nwould assume you had seen some ancient art and were unconsciously\ninfluenced by it. For you …” He shrugged. “Fortune can do unthought,\nfantodic things.”\n“I’m sorry. Fantodic?”\n“It means … unnerving?” he said. “I’m sorry. I don’t keep up on shifts in\nlanguage, nor am I an expert on Fortune. Best speak to Midius—your Wit—\nabout that. A fantodic man himself, that one.”\nHe took her page and carefully folded it to place in his pocket. She\ncringed at that—she hadn’t applied lacquer to keep it from smudging—but\nwas distracted by something happening up beyond the walls of Lasting\nIntegrity. A group of glowing figures were descending, trailing various\nkinds of spren who could soar with them—attracted to their use of\nStormlight. The Windrunners had arrived.\nSeconds later, Drehy, his spren, and some of his squires landed nearby,\nholding common spears, as Shardblades couldn’t enter Shadesmar. At least\nnot in Shardblade shape.\n“I believe,” Drehy said, “a lighteyed lady ordered a palanquin trip to\nUrithiru?”\n“Funny-looking palanquin, Drehy,” Shallan said, rising.\n“Now, that’s not nice, Brightness,” Drehy said, thumbing over his"

He’s unique.”\nShiosak—who was actually a rather handsome, affable Veden man—\nrolled his eyes.\nFive Windrunners. Not enough to take everyone; Adolin’s soldiers, and\nlikely some of her agents, would have to make the more boring trip back via\nboat. Most wouldn’t mind that. The bigger problem would be Adolin—who\nwould have to leave his horse and his swords behind. Shallan stood up as\nher husband, grinning ear to ear, came jogging up the steps. He knew\nDrehy, of course. Adolin knew everyone. She watched him count the\nWindrunners, do the calculations in his mind, and come to the same\nconclusion.\nAlmost.\n“How many of you,” Adolin said, “will it take to fly my horse home?”\nRegardless, the events surrounding the cleansing of Shinovar are\nof specific relevance, and I am doing my best to record what I can\ndiscover of the Wind’s own words regarding them. Though, now\nthat the Wind and Heralds have vanished, I have only two sources\nwho can speak of these events.\nThey are my witnesses.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 5\nDalinar looked out a window at the frosted peaks of the Ur mountain range.\nKaladin knew these lands were probably claimed by some kingdom, yet it\nwas difficult to imagine. Owning fields was one thing, but mountains?\nIf someone could claim them though, it would be the mountain of a man\nby the window. Dalinar didn’t lean against the stone frame to relax as\nanother might have. He clasped his hands behind him, his spine straight.\nWearing a Kholin blue uniform with his glyphs on the back: the tower and\nthe crown.\nSzeth sat on the floor near the far corner. Dressed once more in white,\nhead shaved. Eyes closed with his long, silvery-sheathed Shardblade in his\nlap. Kaladin had always thought the weapon wicked in appearance, with\nthose hooked crossguard arms and the jet-black hilt. Szeth appeared to be\nmeditating. Calm, rhythmic breaths. Storms, even when relaxing, the man\nwas unnerving.\nSyl maintained both her human size and the colors on her havah as she\nwalked over to stare Szeth in the face to see if he was peeking.\n“How are you feeling?” Dalinar asked. “About your upcoming task?”\n“Good, sir,” Kaladin said. “The world is going to be different, whatever\nhappens in ten days. Wit says I need to find a new place in it—so I’m going\nto try this. You asked me to be a surgeon, not a soldier. I’m game.”\nA surgeon for the mind—who didn’t cut with a scalpel, but with calm\nwords and understanding. Storms, that seemed so much more difficult.\n“Excellent,” Dalinar said. “I’ve had reports on the men you helped with\ntheir battle shock. It’s remarkable.”"

It’s remarkable.”\n“Take a person from the darkness and show them that light still exists. It\nwon’t fix everything, but it does make a difference.”\n“Light,” Dalinar said, gazing out across snowfields reflecting sunlight\nlike liquid diamonds. “Ishar said something about light, when he told me he\nwanted to refound the Oathpact. Saying the Words—the moment when an\noath is sworn, even by someone else nearby—brings clarity … and should\nrestore him, if briefly.” He glanced toward Szeth.\n“Sir?” Kaladin asked.\n“I’m sending Szeth with you.”\n“He’s the companion you promised me?” Kaladin said.\n“I return to my homeland,” Szeth said softly, “to set right what is wrong.\nTo cleanse an evil. To achieve the Fourth Ideal, a Skybreaker must\nundertake a crusade of righteous cause. Upon completing it, I will be poised\nfor the final step, in which a man becomes the law itself. I wished to go\nalone, but Dalinar has insisted I bring you.”\nKaladin took that in, then stepped closer to Dalinar, turning his back on\nSzeth—which felt very wrong to do. “Sir,” he hissed. “That man is not\nstable. He doesn’t need to be sent on a quest. He needs time, attention, and\nthe help of …”\nKaladin trailed off as he noticed Dalinar’s expression.\n“Storms,” Kaladin said. “You think I can do something to help Szeth\nwhile he’s trying to ‘cleanse the evil’ of his homeland?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, firm. “You up to it, soldier?”\nKaladin glanced over his shoulder at Szeth. “Sir, with all due respect, I\nhave managed to help one group of men suffering a mental burden that I\nunderstand from personal experience. You can’t expect me to replicate that\nkind of success with an extreme case like Szeth. I would need months to\ndevise a treatment!”\n“We should … speak in private. Plus, I feel like I need some perspective.\nWhat about you, soldier?”\n“Always, sir,” Kaladin said as Syl joined them, head cocked, eyeing\nDalinar.\n“Excellent,” Dalinar said, turning and walking toward the door. He took\na small wooden box from a table by the wall, then tucked it under one arm.\n“Szeth, will you be fine here on your own for a while?”\n“I’m never alone,” the man said in his lightly accented voice. “Even\nwithout spren or sword, I’d have the voices.” He looked straight at Kaladin\nwith all the emotion of a corpse. Storms. Dalinar wanted him to help that\nman? The assassin who had killed Dalinar’s own brother?\nKaladin followed Dalinar out, expecting them to chat in the next room,\nbut Dalinar led them up the steps to the roof of Urithiru.

And it’s so warm.”\n“It’s Brightness Navani,” Syl said, leaning over the side to look down.\n“And her bond to the tower. This city flourished with life once. It will\nagain.”\n“Reminds me of home,” Kaladin said. “It’s more humid there than on the\nPlains.”\n“Home …” Syl glanced toward the sky, where Kaladin’s armor spren\nplayed. Her ponytail loosened, letting her hair fly freely, white-blue, waving\nin real wind. She grinned at him. “I never felt like I had a home until I\nfound this.”\n“Urithiru?” Kaladin asked.\n“By association, yes.”\n“Have you been taking lessons on being enigmatic from Wit?”\n“Hardly,” she said, resting against the stone railing. “Your family is here\nnow, Kaladin. Does that make this your home now?”\n“I suppose it has to be. My other home is in the hands of the enemy.”\n“Not just the enemy,” Syl said. “The singers.”\nIt was a valid point, difficult to remember. It was their home as well. The\nAlethi parshmen had been enslaved too, but had taken their homeland for\nthemselves. In other circumstances, he would have cheered their fight—he\nknew precisely what it was like to have your dignity stripped away, to be\nbeaten until you lost personality and volition, becoming a thing.\nHe looked again toward Dalinar, whose contest with Odium was\nsupposed to offer a way out of this mess. Kaladin walked over, the breeze in\nhis face—which always felt invigorating.\n“I keep hoping,” Dalinar said softly, “that there are answers\nsomewhere.”\n“Sir?”\n“I have set us on a collision course with destiny,” he explained. “If I\nlose, I might have roped all of us into a much greater war than we knew was\npossible.”\n“So you have to win,” Kaladin said.\n“I do,” Dalinar said. “But I can’t imagine what the contest will be like. I\nfeel it won’t be a clash of swords, but what? What am I missing? Have I\ndoomed us, Kaladin?” He took a deep breath, and with the arm that the\nsmall wooden box was tucked under, he pointed out at the field of white\nsnowcaps. “Can you take us to that peak? The big one that looks like the\ntallest spike on a crown.”\n“Sir,” Kaladin said, “the tower’s warmth won’t reach that far.”\n“Exactly the point, Kaladin.” Dalinar held his hand toward him. “If you\nplease.”\nKaladin breathed in, drawing strength—Light—from the tower.

He\nLashed them upward, Syl shrinking and zipping after them as Kaladin flew\nDalinar to the specific peak, his armor spren spinning about him. The\ntransition to colder air was gradual—the circle of warmth around Urithiru\nwas more like a corona than a bubble. Bare stone gave way to little rivers of\nsnowmelt, which gave way to icy slush, until they finally entered a realm of\ndeep-packed snow.\nAs they drew close, the Towerlight he’d taken failed him, and he had to\nrely on Stormlight from his pouch. It seemed the human body couldn’t hold\nTowerlight unless it was right by Urithiru. Once he’d taken in replacement\nLight and stabilized them, he increased the pressure. The tower’s\nprotections offered more than just warmth. Rock could talk all day about\nhow the air in the Peaks was healthier, but Kaladin had seen firsthand that\npeople found it hard to breathe up this high. Fortunately, Kaladin’s powers\nincluded a more nebulous ability to sculpt pressure and air.\nHe kept a little invisible bubble of thicker air around them. It was\nsomething he had been doing instinctively, but wanted to be more conscious\nof. Syl returned to full size as Kaladin settled himself and Dalinar down\ninto the snow with a crunching sound. Such bizarre stuff. Why did it\ncrunch? It was only very cold water, wasn’t it? Shouldn’t it crack?\nTheir breath puffed in the air—except Syl’s, of course. Though she did\nmimic breathing; her chest subtly rose and fell. Had she always done that?\nColdspren began to grow around Kaladin’s feet, like little crystal spikes.\nDalinar picked up a handful of snow and let it trail between his fingers.\n“Navani says that some of the deeper snow here is likely ancient. We walk\non strata of ice like the strata of rock, for it never gets warm enough up here\nfor it to melt. It remains frozen. For eons.”\n“Sir?” Kaladin said. “Why did we come out into the cold?”\n“I wanted to look at the tower from the outside,” he said, turning and\nstudying Urithiru. “I never can get a good view of it from the Oathgates. It’s\ntoo massive.”\nKaladin stepped up beside Dalinar and examined the tower, their breath\npuffing in front of them.\n“Roshar has seen so many versions of this war, Kaladin,” Dalinar said\nsoftly. “We’ve been fighting the singers since our first generations on this\nplanet, a time that stretches back far beyond our written histories. Through\nmultiple calamities, and the almost utter loss of civilization. I want to see\nthat cycle ended.”\n“We all want that, sir,” Syl said.\n“I know. Yet I can’t help wondering. Should one man have such power\nand authority as I do?” Dalinar shook his head. “Jasnah puts ideas in my\nmind, like cremlings wintering in the heart of a plant, eating it from the\ninside until the weather turns. The world didn’t decide upon this contest. I\ndid. Was there a better way?”\n“I don’t know, sir,” Kaladin said. “I really don’t.”"

I respect your complaints about Szeth. I understand them. He\nis a difficult case, and you have only just begun to learn how to help those\nwith mental wounds.” Dalinar turned, scanning the snowfield. From here\nthe peak of the mountain didn’t seem pointed at all—merely a gentle hilltop\ncovered in snow. “And yet, all these eons. All those deaths, like strata\nbeneath our feet … We need to change, Kaladin. To do things differently. I\nthink we start by not throwing people away when we worry they’re\ndefective.”\n“He murdered dozens.”\n“On orders from the person who was effectively his owner,” Dalinar\nsaid, “while in a compromised mental state. He’s trying to find a better\npath. Kaladin, when I asked you to step down from your post, how did you\nfeel?”\n“Worthless,” Kaladin said, remembering what Wit had told him. Who\nwould you be if there was no one you needed to save, no one you needed to\nkill?\n“You saved me from Szeth once,” Dalinar said. “Now I’m asking for a\ndifferent kind of rescue. Save him, and save the Herald Ishar. Hard, I know,\nbut I want you to try anyway. Because this is the end, and I don’t have other\noptions.”\nKaladin glanced at Syl, who nodded. And storm him, Dalinar was right.\nAgain.\n“I’ll try to help them,” Kaladin said. “I’ll do what I can. But sir … you\nshould know. Wit told me I won’t be able to come back in time to help\nyou.”\n“He said that, did he? Well, Szeth can write, so we can send a spanreed\nwith you to report back that way, in case you truly can’t return in time.”\n“I guess,” Kaladin said. “But … well, Wit told me that Ishar couldn’t\nhelp you, sir. Not in the way you want.”\nDalinar grunted. “What else?”\n“Mostly just that … and that I should listen to the Wind, and Roshar.”\nKaladin took a deep breath. “I think the Wind has been speaking to me, sir.\nA … version of it that is a spren? I don’t fully understand. It told me to\nlisten to you though.”\n“Well, I appreciate it for that. The Heralds are important; they’re part of\nthis. I can’t explain why yet, but I have felt it in my gut for weeks now.\nMaybe longer.” Dalinar put a firm hand on Kaladin’s shoulder, wet from the\nsnow, his foot crunching as he moved. “Ishar … he’s not like Ash or Taln.\nHe’s active, and planning to interfere with what we’re doing. He’s\ndangerous. Exceptionally dangerous.” Dalinar met his eyes. “He’s in\nShinovar, which means he has the Honorblades.”\nSyl whistled softly.\n“Each weapon,” Dalinar said, “is as dangerous as the one Szeth used to"

Now he’s in Shinovar,\nwhich we know nothing about, and which has been suspiciously quiet for\nthis entire war. I’m worried.\n“Szeth is going regardless, but I can’t rely upon him for anything\nneeding nuance or strong decision-making. I can rely on you for both. I\nneed someone watching my back, soldier. I don’t want to find myself\noutmaneuvered by a madman at the last moment. Maybe if we’re lucky,\nyou’ll be able to get through to Ishar and bring me help, despite what Wit\nfears. Even if not, I need some eyes on that land. We’ve ignored it far too\nlong.”\nStorms. This was his true task: help a demigod overcome his\nmegalomania. By Sigzil’s reports, Ishar had been taking spren from\nShadesmar and bringing them physically to this realm—permanently killing\nthem in the process. Creating twisted half-flesh bodies for them that could\nnot survive.\nEach of the Heralds was suffering some kind of severe mental trauma.\nWorse, Kaladin worried that their problems were partially supernatural in\nnature. Who was Kaladin to try to figure out the pathology of gods?\nHe didn’t say any of this, because he knew the answer.\nWho was Kaladin to do this?\nThe only person available. Stormfather help them all.\n“We’ll do it, sir,” Syl said. “Well, Kaladin will do the mental healing bit.\nI’ll do what I can though.”\nThis drew an odd glance from Dalinar. He wasn’t used to honorspren\nbeing visible to anyone but their Radiant, let alone ones who walked around\nfull sized and acted like soldiers. Kaladin, though, found it appropriate. In a\nway, Syl had kicked all this off by deciding to bond him. Why shouldn’t she\nget a voice in agreeing to their next mission?\n“Good,” Dalinar said to the two of them. “I do have … one other thing,\nKaladin. Do you still have that cloak I gave you when you first joined my\narmy?”\n“I do,” he said. “I keep it as a mark of pride, sir, though I don’t often\nwear it. Doesn’t match the uniform, and … well, it has your house glyphs\non the back. Emblazoned to indicate a member of the royal family.”\n“I can understand that,” Dalinar said. “House Stormblessed is a new\nlighteyed house, sure to begin its own grand traditions. It’s not normally\nfitting that you would wear another house’s glyphs.”\n“Except?” Kaladin asked.\nThe man untucked the small wooden box from under his arm and opened\nit, then took out a sheet of paper and unfolded it.

I have a second throne now,\nshared with Navani, here at Urithiru. Yet we are old, and our children are\neither unwilling or already committed. Jasnah is dedicated to restoring\nAlethkar, and wishes her focus to stay there. Gavinor must remain her heir,\nto the Alethi throne. He will ascend to it if she dies.”\n“At his age?” Kaladin asked.\n“A child can, and must, inherit to preserve the throne,” Dalinar said.\n“That settles Alethkar, which is separate from Urithiru and from the Knights\nRadiant. So this kingdom has no heir to take over should something happen\nto me and Navani.”\nDalinar turned, holding the sheet of paper, and looked to Kaladin. Syl\ngasped. Pale yellow shockspren burst around Kaladin, and he felt his\ninsides crumbling. “Sir,” he said, going stiff. “Please, no. I’m broken.”\n“Life breaks us,” Dalinar said. “Then we fill the cracks with something\nstronger.”\n“Renarin. He’s Radiant.”\n“He can see glimpses of the future, and what he’s seen makes him reject\nthis charge. I support him in this. Soldier, Renarin is bonded to a corrupted\nspren, and we as yet don’t know the effects that might have. Adolin flat-out\nrefuses. I … hope to be able to resolve our problems, as I worry I am the\nreason he turned down the throne of Alethkar. But even if we did, Urithiru\nshould have a Radiant at its head.” Dalinar held out the sheet to Kaladin. “I\nwill not force this upon you, Kaladin. But I will ask, because I must. Will\nyou be our heir?”\nIt was like a cold bucket of rainwater thrown over him. He couldn’t\nrespond. Being an officer was difficult, being a lighteyes worse, but being\nroyalty?\n“Son,” Dalinar said softly. “I see your hatred still. Hopefully not for\nanyone specific—but for what has been done to you. In the last years, I’ve\nbeen forced to accept that the distinction between lighteyes and dark is one\nof pure social construction. Nobility is not of the blood, but of the heart.\nBut it must go the other way too. You don’t like what we represent, but to\ncontinue feeling as you do … it will eat you from the inside.”\n“I know,” Kaladin forced out. “But this?”\n“Nothing more,” Dalinar said, handing him the document, “than a duty\nto serve.

        "text": "to serve. Navani and I are Bondsmiths. If I fall in this contest, she will take\nthe throne. She will also be a target though, and it is entirely possible that\nneither of us will survive.\n“If the worst happens, present that letter at Urithiru. It is ratified by\nmultiple ardents. I’ve spoken to Jasnah, the highprinces, and the other\nmonarchs about this, and everyone agrees that a Radiant is best for this\nduty. Unfortunately, most of them are untested. It is, of course, your\ndecision. If you don’t take the throne, I’ve arranged for Dami to be next.”\nDami. He was a Riran Stoneward, with whom Kaladin hadn’t spent\nmuch time. He was well liked, however, and had reportedly said the fourth\noath the day before, after the campaign in Emul, becoming the third to do\nso after Jasnah and Kaladin.\n“If he won’t do it,” Dalinar added, “then it will fall to the highprinces of\nAlethkar. Aladar first and—God Beyond help us—Sebarial after that.”\n“You’re kidding.”\n“He’s good with money.”\n“So good half of it ends up in his pocket.”\n“He’s a better man than he gives himself credit for. Navani thinks the\nstate of his books is a front for his hidden competence. Regardless, I hope\nthat we’ll all survive, and other Radiants with proper leadership training can\nbe placed into the line. Or perhaps something like Jasnah has always\ndreamed of, a more … representational method of governance. You should\nread some of her essays on the topic.”\n“I …” Kaladin glanced at Syl for support.\nShe grinned back at him.\n“You’re not helping,” he said.\n“I’m kind of royalty already,” she said. “It’s not so bad. Trust me.”\n“It’s not the same.” Kaladin looked down at the paper. “I will do what I\ncan for Ishar and Szeth, sir, and send you information on Shinovar. But this\nletter … this is too much.”\n“I’ll accept your decision,” Dalinar said. “All I ask is that instead of\nmaking an immediate judgment call now, you consider a little while. For\nme. Out of respect?”\nStorming man. But he was right—this was something that should be\ngiven some time. Kaladin forced himself to fold the sheet and put it into his\npocket. Logically, there was no difference between darkeyed and light—and\nhe was a lighteyes anyway now. Ruler of a small piece of land in Alethkar\nthat he’d probably never visit. Even so, this felt like a betrayal.\n“I’ll consider it,” he said anyway.\nHowever, the Wind did not think like a person does. This should\nnot surprise anyone who has familiarity with a spren, though such\nthings are less common now than they once were.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 5\nThey brought the horse.\nThey literally brought the storming horse.\nWith Adolin riding it.\nShallan stood on the obsidian stone outside Lasting Integrity with her\nhands on her hips.

The\nhonorspren group who had left earlier had gathered in the near distance,\ndeciding their next move.\nGallant, Adolin’s Ryshadium, had a bit of a glow to him beyond that of\nthe Lashings. When he moved his head, he left an unusual afterimage.\nShe’d never understood why. Now, with Stormlight, he glowed even more.\nShallan expected the enormous black horse to panic as he hovered a few\nfeet off the ground, but while Gallant worked his legs as if he were running\nin slow motion, he otherwise seemed calm.\nAdolin grinned at her from the horse’s back.\n“You could leave the equipment behind,” Shallan said, folding her arms.\n“You don’t need all of that, do you?”\n“Shallan,” he said, offended. “I’m traveling light! I’ve left ninety percent\nof my clothing.”\n“And brought all of your swords.”\n“I need them.”\nMost of the weapons were packed away in special boxes hung from\nGallant’s sides, though a few—like Adolin’s pet greatsword—were in their\nown sheaths attached to the saddle. Shallan walked up and tapped the\nenormous two-handed weapon. “You need this? Adolin, it weighs almost as\nmuch as a person.”\n“It weighs seven pounds,” Adolin said dryly. “Have you ever wielded\nanything other than a Shardblade?”\n“My razor-sharp wit.” She hesitated. “Okay, maybe more like blunt-\nforce wit, applied liberally, with no regard for collateral damage.” She\npatted Gallant on the side and walked forward past his moving legs—which\nended in wide stone hooves, flatter and harder than those of common\nhorses. He looked down and met her eyes with glassy blue ones of his own,\nthen turned his head up toward the sky. Almost aspirationally. As if he’d\nbeen waiting for a chance to fly.\nWell, she supposed if it wasn’t going to panic him … She couldn’t\ndecide, though, if Adolin—strapped in, glowing faintly himself from a\nLashing—was inspiring or patently comical. She glanced at Maya, who\nfolded her arms and was smiling, shaking her head. Storms, she was making\nso much progress so quickly. It gave Shallan hope for Testament.\nThat thought made her turn toward the rocky shore between land and\nglass-bead ocean. Several dozen figures lingered there, standing waist-deep:\na variety of spren, each with their eyes scratched out.\n“There were hundreds of deadeyes on that shore at one point,” Adolin\nsaid softly. “Do you think they knew about the trial somehow? And what\nMaya would say?”\n“They had to,” Shallan said.\n“Who told them though?”\nShe thought of her sketches and the strange things her fingers sometimes\nknew. “No one.”\nAs they watched, a cultivationspren like Maya turned and walked out\ninto the ocean.\n“They return,” Maya said in her rasping voice. “Return.

        "text": "“You mean they return to the bearers of their Blades?” Adolin said.\nA living Shardblade like Pattern never fully returned to Shadesmar while\ntheir Radiant was in the Physical Realm. Shallan would summon him as a\nBlade, and his little pattern form would fade from her skirt—or from\nwherever it was—and travel instantly to her as a Blade. When she\ndismissed that Blade, he’d appear as a little pattern again. He was only\nphysical in Shadesmar right now because she’d traveled here through an\nOathgate.\nDeadeyes were different. When dismissed as Blades, they returned to\nShadesmar to wander. Notum had told her once that they tended to stay near\nwhere the bearer of their Blade was in the Physical Realm. So many of\nthem. Hundreds, living these terrible half lives. “We’ll help them, Maya,”\nShallan said. “Once we figure out how to replicate the progress you’ve\nmade.”\nShe nodded. Behind them, the Windrunners lowered Gallant back down.\nThe horse snorted in annoyance. Or … could she really say it felt such\nemotions? Maybe she was being influenced too much by Adolin, who\nswore that Ryshadium had near-human levels of intelligence. Surely it\nwasn’t annoyed; it was just snorting the way horses did.\nMaya continued to stare as another deadeye walked into the bizarre surf.\n“Lost,” Maya whispered. “Those are lost Blades, Adolin.”\nAdolin dismounted. “Lost Blades, Maya?”\n“Swords,” she said. She still labored sometimes to speak. “In stone. In\nwater. Lost. For so many, many years …”\n“What happens to a Shardblade if it’s abandoned?” Shallan asked. “Like\nif a ship bearing a Shardbearer sinks?”\n“It stays there forever,” Adolin said. “Maya, they wouldn’t be here if\nthey’re lost. They’d be manifested as Blades in the real world.”\n“No,” she said. “People stop thinking about them. They fade away after\ncenturies … to be lost. Their sword vanishes from your world, and they\nwander forever.”\n“Poor things,” Shallan said as the last few turned and walked away into\nthe beads. “We will help them, Maya. Adolin and I will make the time,\nwhen this is all over. We’ll find each and every one.”\nAdolin frowned, perhaps considering the logistics of that. “I wonder if\nAunt Navani could design a fabrial to help locate them. We could at least\ntry to make them comfortable on this side.”\nMaya smiled at that. “I think … that would be wonderful.”\nAdolin went to his soldiers to prepare them for his departure. Shallan, in\nturn, hiked over to Vathah. The Lightweaver was kneeling with his spren\nbeside the bead ocean, practicing commanding the beads. As she watched,\nhe sculpted a chair from them—the little beads locking together like they\nwere magnetic. He was better at this than she, though he still needed a bead\nto use as a model. He clutched one in his hand, the soul of a chair in the\nPhysical Realm.\nThis was a lesser and easier skill than the next step—using Stormlight to\nre-create the entire object on this side, which was called manifesting."

Shallan kept wanting to describe him as the “former\ndeserter,” but that was wrong. She needed to actively change her\nperspective; he’d come a long way since she’d recruited him. These days—\ngrouchy though he might be—he was an accomplished Lightweaver.\n“It looks like only Adolin and I will go with the Windrunners,” she said\nto him and Mosaic, his spren. “With the horse.”\n“You taking or leaving your spren?” he asked, standing up and letting the\nchair collapse back to beads.\nIt was a good question. They could be left, and be summoned to the\nPhysical Realm once Shallan arrived. Maya had seemed worried about that\nthough, and Shallan had felt the same from Testament. She didn’t want\nthem to feel abandoned.\n“We’ll bring them,” she said. “Including Pattern.”\n“Makes sense,” Vathah replied. “If something unexpected happens, it\nwill be better if you aren’t split up.”\n“You all won’t be too bored taking the longer trip home?”\n“Bored?” Mosaic asked, standing next to him. “Bored is good.”\nVathah laughed. “She’s right, Brightness. While you’ve been inside that\nblock of a building, Mosaic and I have been having a grand time playing\ncards with nothing important to do.”\nShe eyed him. She’d have believed that of Gaz or Red. Vathah though?\nHe wilted if you left him without attention.\n“I like it here,” he admitted, staring out over the churning bead ocean. “I\nlike making things out of those beads, and I feel … more in touch with my\npowers. My Lightweaving is working better and better, and now that we\nhave more Stormlight from those Windrunners … well, I’m not sad to take\na slower route home, Brightness. Ishnah, though, is going to throw a fit.\nShe’s beyond tired of the rest of us.”\n“She’ll survive,” Shallan said. “I’m sure she can get a little more mileage\nout of flirting with the soldiers.”\n“They could do better,” he said. “Wish they wouldn’t encourage her.”\nVathah glanced away. Toward Ishnah. Then blushed. Mosaic hummed\nhappily.\nVathah actually blushed. About Ishnah. Not Beryl, who was sultry\nenough to be mistaken for some kind of passionspren. Ishnah: short, not\nparticularly curvaceous, and with a striking tendency to use her\nLightweaving to give herself edgy tattoos and black fingernails. Huh. Well,\ngood for him. Assuming he didn’t screw it up.\nBack among the caravan soldiers, Felt waved to Shallan in farewell. He\nwas one of Adolin’s soldiers: a shorter, foreign man with drooping\nmustaches and a floppy hat. He’d traveled Shadesmar before, and she had\nthe impression that he wasn’t even from Roshar. But if she was going to\nleave the caravan in someone’s hands, he—as one of Dalinar’s elites—\nwould be more than capable."

But if she was going to\nleave the caravan in someone’s hands, he—as one of Dalinar’s elites—\nwould be more than capable.\nSoon, a small retinue of honorspren leaders exited Lasting Integrity.\nShallan moved toward them, boots sliding on the obsidian as she hopped\ndown over a small shelf. She’d changed into travel clothing: trousers under\na long skirtlike coat. Radiant preferred something more battle-ready, but\nShallan had chosen their outfit. She had, however, put her hair into a tight\nbun. She’d made the mistake of leaving it loose while traveling with\nWindrunners before.\nKelek stood at the front of the small group of honorspren. “You still not\nwilling to come?” Shallan asked him. “We could put you on the horse with\nAdolin.”\nHe merely wrung his hands and looked at the ground. So, Shallan waved\nto the honorspren who’d come to send them off—and gave them an upbeat\nsmile, because she figured it would annoy them. Then she turned to go.\n“Take care,” Kelek said, “with your two bonds, child. You may see\nthings that are not good for the healthy mortal mind.”\n“Fortunately, I haven’t had one in years,” she said, glancing back. “I\nmake do with this one instead.”\n“I’m sorry. I know how that feels.”\n“Part of being an artist is training to see the world from many different\nperspectives.” Shallan shrugged. “My way has its difficulties, but once in a\nwhile I see light that no one else seems to. Light reflecting off waves,\nbreaking into sprays upon the ocean, making shapes appear for a heartbeat.\nThe light reflecting in the eyes of someone I’m talking to, as if gleaming\nfrom their soul. In those moments, I know that what I am lets me see what\nothers cannot. Those moments, I’m … if not grateful, then appreciative.”\nKelek cocked his head. “Light … Yes. Light, energy, matter, Investiture.\nThey’re all variations on a theme—the same essence, in different forms.\nThat is especially important for you to understand, with your illusions.”\nShe frowned. “But … illusions can’t change anything, Kelek. They’re\njust figments made of Stormlight.”\n“Oh?” Kelek said, pointing to the honorspren. “What do you think they\nare? Investiture. A form of Light. There were once Lightweavers who could\ngive some substance, briefly, to the things they created.”\n“There were?” Shallan said. But then she thought back to a moment at\nthe Battle of Thaylen Field where she could have sworn she’d felt the\nillusory versions of Radiant and Veil as if they were briefly real. It wasn’t\nthe only time, was it? When one of her illusions had been a little too solid?\nLight … matter … energy. They were the same; when you manifested an\nobject in Shadesmar, you used Stormlight to make a physical re-creation.\nAnd spren could be physical, even if they were made of Light.\nShe needed to change her perspective.\n“If I am to give you parting wisdom,” the Herald said, “it is this: just\nbecause something is fleeting, do not imagine it to be unimportant.” He"

But thank you. For\nnot hurting me. For listening.”\nAnother change of perspective, then. Shallan nodded. She’d begun\nfeeling the trip had been a failure, but it wasn’t. Adolin had made some\nheadway with the honorspren. They’d delivered a Radiant ambassador. And\nshe … well, she had banished Formless, had incorporated Veil, and had\nfound the courage to explain so much to Adolin.\nPlus, maybe she’d helped Kelek. A lonely old hero, worn ragged by time\nand from standing too long in the wind.\nSo she hugged him.\nNearby, the honorspren gasped. Probably the right reaction to someone\nunexpectedly grabbing one of the Heralds—demigods of myth. But Kelek\nwrapped his arms around her and held on.\n“I want to be better,” he whispered.\n“We all do,” she said.\nThat was the sole exchange they needed. She pulled back, and he\nnodded, his eyes wet with tears. Then she turned and walked to Adolin,\nMaya, the Cryptics, and the Windrunners.\n“Ready?” Drehy asked, his spren at his side, manifesting as a tall,\nfashionable honorspren woman.\nShallan nodded. For gear, she’d brought only her satchel, in which she’d\nstashed some necessities. Months spent chasing Jasnah, then losing\neverything and barely surviving to reach the Shattered Plains, had taught\nher to travel light. With a more grounded interpretation of that term than\nAdolin’s.\n“Great,” Drehy said, holding up a fabrial built around a glowing yellow\nheliodor. He pointed across the bead ocean. “We’re going to head for the\nAzimir Oathgate.”\n“That one is letting people transfer to Shadesmar now?” Shallan asked.\n“The awakening of the tower persuaded most of the gate spren,” Drehy\nsaid. “The two at Azimir are surlier than most, but they should let us\nthrough.” He pointed with his fabrial. “Flight here took just over four hours.\nAs long as we stay at forty-eight degrees from the baseline, we should be\nright on target.”\n“Wait,” she said, trying to catch up. “Awakened tower? And what is that\nfabrial?”\n“They call it a ‘compass,’” Drehy said. “An old-style device that points\nthe way in Shadesmar—we found a few in the hidden Urithiru storehouses,\ncourtesy of Bondsmith Navani and the Sibling.”\nShallan blinked. Bondsmith Navani? The Sibling? Wit was probably\nlaughing somewhere to himself at all the things he’d left out of their\nadmittedly brief conversations.\n“We’ll fill you in as we fly,” Drehy said, with a grin. “Let’s get going.”\nThe Windrunners distributed glass masks against the wind, then raised"

Gallant gave an excited whinny, then led\nthe way eagerly—as if galloping in the air, Adolin in the saddle.\nLasting Integrity, the honorspren, and the caravan dwindled behind them.\nShrank. Then vanished.\nSoon after, Radiant found herself wishing that the Windrunners had\nbrought Navani’s traveling sphere. Even with the mask, flying face-first\ninto the wind wasn’t particularly enjoyable. It was at best mildly miserable.\nIn the sphere, Shallan could have spent the time drawing.\nAdolin and Gallant, naturally, loved it. They flew together, Adolin\nstanding up in his stirrups, holding to the reins—which on a Ryshadium\nwere more about stabilizing oneself than directing the beast, as commands\nwere commonly given through the knees. On Gallant’s current tack, they\ndidn’t attach to his face, but to a harness around the neck.\nAdolin was grinning like a boy playing in the rain. And Gallant galloped\neagerly, wind blowing his lips back to expose his teeth, making him look\nlike he was grinning. Adolin Kholin, highprince, son of the most powerful\nman on the planet, renowned swordsman, was secretly one of the goofiest\npeople she’d ever known. Shallan emerged again and blinked, taking a\nMemory of the two of them—Adolin with his goggles on, hair blowing\nabout frantically, Gallant charging.\nAdolin saw her watching and waved eagerly, then gestured to Gallant as\nif to say, Hey, Shallan! Can you believe I’m riding a flying horse?\nIt made her heart melt into a pool of bubbling jelly. Perhaps the greatest\nmiracle of her life was that Adolin had somehow managed to remain single\nuntil she arrived. She passed the next hour or so admiring him off and on.\nRight up until the moment they were attacked.\nHer memory was keen, but her interpretation and explanation of\nthat memory could be fanciful. Those days, though, I believe that\nshe was deliberate, concerned, and focused.\nShe did not see the future.\nBut she somehow knew it anyway.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 5\nKaladin found Szeth standing in the antechamber, his strange Shardblade\nsheathed and tied across his back. He appeared to be staring at the wall.\n“All right,” Kaladin said. “Easiest way for us to get to Shinovar is to fly\nwith the highstorm after it passes Azimir later tonight.”\n“As you wish,” Szeth said.\n“I’m going to pick up my rucksack,” Kaladin said. “Do you need\nanything?”\n“No.”\nOh! A voice popped into Kaladin’s head. He’d always construed it as\nvaguely masculine. Are we going somewhere?\n“Haven’t you paid attention, sword-nimi?” Szeth asked calmly, still\nstaring at the wall.\nOf course I have! the strange Shardblade replied.

But if it’s important that they be there, I want to know.\n“I’ll bring snacks,” Kaladin said. “Szeth, let’s meet at the Oathgate in\ntwo hours. All right?”\nSzeth nodded.\nKaladin collected Syl and his armor spren, who were once again\nhovering in the room where Navani was taking meetings. Then he leaped\nover the banister and dropped almost the entire length of the tower before\nswooping into a corridor along which people were accustomed to seeing\nRadiants fly overhead. The Wind went with him.\nThey landed by the tower’s Windrunner barracks and made their way to\nthe quartermaster’s office. Leyten, a heavyset man with short, curly light-\nbrown hair, was doing his usual puttering with ledgers and accounts. Far too\nfond of numbers, that one was, for all his skill as an armorer.\n“Ah!” Leyten said, straightening and throwing him a Bridge Four salute.\n“Got your things right here.” He disappeared into a rear room, then came\nout with a travel rucksack, no fewer than three canteens strapped to it.\n“Bedroll,” Leyten said, “rations, medical kit, mess kit. Two extra\nuniforms.” He winked at Kaladin.\n“Thanks, Leyten.” Kaladin turned the pack around on the counter, and\nnoted the side pocket for personal effects. He unzipped it and found Wit’s\nflute: carved from dark wood, with some odd knobs partitioning it. Kaladin\nhad sent it down with his other items, because nobody could pack for a ruck\nlike Leyten. Kaladin always felt uncertain unpacking for the night, as he\nnever knew if he’d be able to magic it all back together in a similarly tight\nand efficient way. In that same pocket was Tien’s small toy horse, along\nwith … a rock?\nYes, a rock. Dull brown. Huh.\n“Oh, sorry!” Leyten said. “I didn’t put that in there.” He reached for it,\nbut Kaladin slipped it back in.\nAs Leyten was showing him how to snap apart and reassemble the new\nmess kit design, Dabbid came out of the rear room carrying some supplies.\nHe gave Kaladin a farewell hug, then continued on his way, whistling to\nhimself. And behind him, darting with a furtive air, was a small windspren?\nNo, an honorspren. Kaladin froze.\n“Yeah,” Leyten said, grinning, “Dabbid hasn’t noticed her yet.”\n“I thought there weren’t any more honorspren coming to us.”\n“It must have to do with Prince Adolin’s trip,” Leyten said, with a shrug.\n“She showed up yesterday, alone, and she’s been trailing Dabbid ever\nsince.”\nSyl frowned, still full sized and visible to all. He thought he heard her\nhuff."

He thought he heard her\nhuff.\n“What?” Kaladin asked.\n“Lusintia,” Syl said. “She’s an absolute bore. No fun at all. I didn’t\nexpect her to join us.”\n“Ethenia likes her,” Leyten said.\n“Ethenia is a bore too,” Syl said. “She likes numbers, almost as much as\nVienta does. And she’s practically a Cryptic.” But then she cocked her head.\n“Maybe I need to rethink some things. Can I note how horribly unfair it is\nthat these newer spren make the transition so quickly? I was essentially a\ndrooling idiot for years.”\n“The bonds form faster,” Leyten said, “because the way was paved by a\nbrilliant, very brave spren pioneer.”\nSyl pulsed, her color becoming more blue, the violet on her sleeves more\nvibrant. “I’ve always liked you, Leyten. Even when you were making armor\nout of skulls.”\n“Used more ribs than skulls,” Leyten said, glancing up at something\nhanging above the doorway to the quartermaster’s office. A breastplate\nseemingly fashioned out of pieces of carapace and bone. Out of respect for\nRlain, they’d used wood for this one, and painted it red-orange. Kaladin\nremembered running with Bridge Four toward the enemy, wearing that\nimprovised equipment, whispers around camp calling them silly things like\nthe Order of Bone.\n“Rlain and now Dabbid,” Kaladin said. “Did any of the other squires\npick up one while I wasn’t looking?”\n“Probably a better question for Skar,” Leyten said, bringing out a bag of\ngemstones for Kaladin. He gestured into the next room. “He’s been working\nwith the new recruits.”\nKaladin should have continued on his way. Sigzil commanded the\nWindrunners, and could worry about these questions. But Kaladin felt\nresponsible, even if he no longer was. Beyond that, there was something in\nthe air. That Wind blowing from behind him, that phantom warning echoing\nin his mind. He wanted to check in one last time, to see that everything was\nall right with his troops.\nFor a storm was coming.\nShallan screamed, twisting in the air, still flying—yet helpless as the\nWindrunners clashed with a group of Heavenly Ones. In a moment, their\npeaceful trip turned chaotic. Blue uniforms zipped past, weaving among\nFused with flowing outfits of stark white, black, and red.\nAll Shallan could do was hang there. She waved her arms, flailed about,\nbut couldn’t do more than turn over onto her back. There was nothing for\nher to grab onto or pull against. Adolin was slightly better off. They’d\nLashed him in such a way that he could sit in the saddle—floating, but not\ncompletely weightless.

A Heavenly One wielding a long lance\nran one of Drehy’s squires straight through, sending a spray of blood across\nShallan. A distant painspren howled, and the squire gasped, dropping her\nspear, arms out to the sides as the lance began to traumatically drain her\nStormlight.\nShallan breathed in Stormlight, frantic for a way to help, trying to devise\na proper illusion.

Then a mace struck the creature square in the forehead.\nShallan glanced at Adolin, who had opened one of his weapon boxes and\nwas fishing out a short sword. He threw this next. Storms. He’d had a mace\nin there all along?\nThe weapons weren’t designed for throwing, but after being hit with\nanother knife, the Heavenly One was forced to pull her lance free of the\nunfortunate squire and go after Adolin instead.\n“Adolin!” Shallan cried as he twisted in the saddle to swipe at the enemy\nhe’d engaged. The Heavenly One did a quick spin around him, then came in\nwith her lance—which she rammed straight through the illusory version of\nAdolin that Shallan created as a distraction.\nIt wasn’t perfect. Shallan didn’t have many sketches of Gallant, and so\nthe horse was off—but her doppelganger of Adolin was flawless. The\nHeavenly One, while turning, had lost track of the real him. She glanced at\nShallan, identified the correct Adolin—and ducked underneath the horse.\nTo rise on the other side and barrel into Adolin.\nAdolin was sent tumbling free, swords falling around him, the saddle\nknocked askew. He fell slowly because of his Lashing. Shallan’s next\nLightweaving—of a Windrunner coming for the Heavenly One—distracted\nthe attacker from chasing Adolin. But Shallan’s eyes followed Adolin as he\nfell thirty feet and crashed into the beads. He’d suffocate down there.\nShallan screamed, struggling as the Lashing carried her away from him.\nNo. No. No!\nShallan … Shallan had been Lashed by Drehy.\nBe. Drehy.\nShe sucked up the Stormlight Lashing her in place. Then, with nothing\nholding her up, she dropped to the beads after Adolin.\nAll agree the first key moment came when Kaladin Stormblessed\nlistened. Though not an Edgedancer, he did a fine impression of\ntheir oaths.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 8\nKaladin hesitated. Listening. What was that feeling?\nAn urgency. He needed to keep moving. He and Syl hurried into the next\nroom of the Windrunner quarters.

Kaladin had recommended Skar’s promotion to company\nsecond, but he had turned it down since he wanted to focus on training.\nToday Skar was teaching new recruits one of his favorite lessons, that of\nquickly setting up and breaking down a defensible camp.\nThis new group encompassed almost all ages, and was split pretty much\nhalf and half male and female. More darkeyes than light. What would cause\na woman in her fifties to leave her hearth and take up a spear? But then,\nKaladin supposed her motivations might not be that different from his own.\nProtecting those who couldn’t protect themselves.\nThe chamber was large and wide, big enough for four separate teams of\neight to practice. Kaladin passed among them as they quickly set up\nbedrolls and camouflage nets to hide from air patrols, pretending this large\nstone room was out in the field. Skar walked the perimeter, tossing spears\nout the window, completely unnoticed by the teams of working recruits.\nKaladin smiled as he trotted over to the shorter Windrunner. Skar always\nreminded Kaladin of Teft, as he had the air of a career soldier, and wore his\nuniform like a second skin. Like a lot of the original Bridge Four members,\nSkar had foreign heritage.\nAs Kaladin joined Skar, the man picked up another spear from beside the\nwall and tossed it out the window. They were on the third story—not far up\nby Urithiru reckoning, but that still meant quite a drop. Presumably Skar\nhad warned the workers outside; they always got a kick out of watching the\nspears go out the window, and would make sure nobody was hurt.\n“Storms,” Kaladin said, glancing at the squires—who in their haste to\nassemble their camps hadn’t yet noticed that Skar was stealing their\nweapons. “This group is particularly oblivious, aren’t they?”\n“Gave them four warnings,” Skar said, walking over to another group of\nspears leaned against the wall.\n“What’s this?” Syl asked, watching with wide eyes as Skar started\ntossing the spears out the window.\n“This lot of recruits needs to learn to think like soldiers now,” Skar said.\n“I’m giving them a little lesson.”\n“You have to keep your spear with you at all times,” Kaladin explained.\n“It’s one of the first things a sergeant drills into you. You can’t just have\nweapons sitting around, tripping everyone—and more, an attack could\nhappen at any moment.”\n“Mostly though, it’s about responsibility,” Skar said, tossing another\nspear. Kaladin heard a distant clatter as it hit the stones of the field outside.\n“And obeying orders.” Skar shook his head in annoyance. “Anyway, you\nneed something, Kal?”\n“Did any other honorspren come with that one that’s been following\nDabbid?” Kaladin said, scanning the wide room. He didn’t pick out any\nhonorspren among these recruits, but they often remained invisible.\n“Nope,” Skar said. “Sorry.”\n“Only one?” Syl asked. “There are hundreds of spren in Lasting\nIntegrity.”"

Kaladin hoped so.\n“So you saw Dabbid?” Skar asked, nudging him.\n“I did,” Kaladin said, grinning.\n“Any idea what will happen with his … ailment once he’s bonded?”\n“Honestly, no,” Kaladin said. “But whatever happens, or doesn’t happen,\nI suspect Dabbid will get a say.”\nHe surveyed the recruits again, feeling … not a sadness. A melancholy.\nOne solemnityspren—rare indeed—spiraled up around him, like an almost\ninvisible grey-blue serpent. “Hey,” he said, realizing his true reason for\ncoming in here. “Watch out for Sigzil. He’s going to need a good sergeant\nbehind him, Skar. I know you’re not one of those, but—”\n“I get it,” Skar said. “And I agree. Sig’ll do a good job, sir. Plus he’s got\nLopen to help out too.”\n“That’s part of what worries me …”\nSkar grinned. “Lopen will surprise you, Kal. He’s changing. Guess we\nall are, now that we don’t have you to watch over us. Kids gotta grow up\nsometime.” He looked into Kaladin’s eyes, searching them. “You’re going\nsomewhere?”\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said.\n“Dangerous?”\n“Not supposed to be,” Kaladin said. “I have reason to worry though, and\nWit implied something … storms, like I might not be coming—”\n“You’ll be back,” Skar said.\n“I don’t know if I will, Skar. Not this time.”\n“I was there when the storms tried to claim you. We went out to cut\ndown a corpse, and found you alive. There’s more than a bit of the wind to\nyou, Kal, and the east wind sees tomorrow before anyone else does. You’ll\nbe back.”\n“You can’t see the future, Skar.”\nHe merely shrugged and walked up to the last pile of spears by the wall.\nSkar began tossing them out the window. “You let the others know you’re\nleaving? You said goodbye, right?”\n“I … Not yet. I might need to leave before …”\nKaladin trailed off as Skar gave him a hard stare. Almost as good as Teft\nmight have. The kind of stare that said, If you storming want to do\nsomething stupid, sir, I won’t call it stupid. To your face.\n“I’ll go and say goodbye,” Kaladin said with a sigh. “Just in case.”\n“Good to hear it, sir,” Skar said, tossing another spear out. “They’ve got\nthat party for Rlain getting his spren. You could stop by there. And Drehy is\nbringing Highprince Adolin and Radiant Shallan back from Shadesmar later\ntoday.”\n“When will they arrive?”\n“Should reach Azimir about an hour before midnight.”\nThere would be time, then, if Kaladin was in Azimir waiting for the\nhighstorm.

As he was contemplating this, the nearest group of squires\nfinally saw what Skar was doing. Several of them yelped as they realized\nhe’d managed to dispose of every spear in the place save three.\nSkar doubled his pace, tossing two more spears out the window before—\nat last—one of the new recruits managed to grab his weapon and hold it\ntight. Like a mother with a newborn, eyes wide. The rest simply gaped out\nthe window.\nSkar grinned. The man enjoyed all this a little too much. Kaladin had\nled, but Skar … he’d been born to teach. It took talent to be a good soldier,\nbut a different kind entirely to make good soldiers.\n“We’re under attack!” Skar bellowed. “Squires, to arms and form ranks!”\nStunned silence.\nThen mass chaos.\nSkar gave Kaladin a wink as he and Syl edged around the side of the\nroom, avoiding the rush of squires who—to their horror—found their\nweapons missing.\n“Sir!” one of them shouted. “Our spears!”\n“Stolen by the enemy when you weren’t looking, you dun spheres!” Skar\nbellowed. “Might have thrown them out the windows!”\n“What do we do?” another asked.\nSkar gave her the most withering of stares. “You go and get them. What\ndo you think?”\nKaladin glanced at Syl, and the two of them lifted off the ground and\nstreaked out through the quartermaster’s office—where Kaladin gave\nLeyten a hug and grabbed his pack. He then got out of the way of the rush\nof recruits running for the lower level. Kaladin almost felt sorry for them—\nexcept that this lesson of keeping track of their weapons would almost\ncertainly save some of their lives.\nSyl nodded the way down another corridor. “We have some time?” she\nasked.\n“Yes,” he said. “I’ll drop in and say goodbye to the others at Rlain’s\ncelebration—everyone but Drehy should be back from patrol by then—and\nthat’s in an hour or so.”\n“Well, we’ve fetched your things,” she said. Her havah fuzzed and again\nbecame a Bridge Four uniform. “It’s time to fetch mine.”\n“You have … things?” Kaladin asked.\nShe grinned eagerly, and flew off through the corridor.\nShallan crashed into the bead ocean.\nAs always, the beads were attracted to her Stormlight. They were small;\nsmaller than spheres, but not tiny. Like beads from a necklace. They\nclacked and clattered, surging against her, suffocating her. The motions\ncreated an undertow, and it always felt like something was trying to pull her\ndown. She should have been able to do something to stop that. Her powers\nwere supposed to give her uncommon affinity with the beads.\nShe’d always feared this place; the first visions she’d had of it, as a girl,\nhad terrified her. Worse, those memories were tied to what she’d done to her\nmother, and the events surrounding Testament’s death.\nEmotions and memories made a jumbled mess inside Shallan. Like vines"

Worse, those memories were tied to what she’d done to her\nmother, and the events surrounding Testament’s death.\nEmotions and memories made a jumbled mess inside Shallan. Like vines\ntangled and wrapped together until they formed an impenetrable snarl.\nFortunately, she had Radiant.\nAs Shallan panicked, Radiant surfaced. She felt among the beads, each\nof them speaking softly, giving her an impression of what it represented in\nthe Physical Realm. A moment later, marshaling her Stormlight, Radiant\nused the impression of a building to give organization to the beads. She rose\nfrom the surface of the ocean on the top of the building. The real one was\nprobably metal, but this one was formed of the beads locking together into a\nkind of mesh.\nRadiant spat out a few beads, then stood up. She needed to find Adolin,\nwho would suffocate without—\nDrehy came swooping past, carrying Adolin. Radiant let out a relieved\nsigh as the Windrunner dropped Shallan’s husband to the platform. Adolin\ncoughed, groaning, but otherwise seemed well.\nShallan emerged as she rushed over and grabbed him in a hug, then\nkissed him squarely right there. Who cared who saw?\n“This is bad, Shallan,” Drehy said, landing with a thump on the bead\nrooftop, making it shake. “Heavenly Ones are normally careful, engaging\nand breaking off quickly. This was a full-on attack meant to kill us.”\nRadiant took over again and scanned the sky—though the battle had\nmoved into the distance. “And what is your assessment of our tactical next\nstep?”\n“… Radiant?” Drehy asked.\nRadiant nodded curtly.\n“I dropped the spren into the beads,” Drehy said, pointing toward a\nnondescript section of the ocean. “They don’t need to breathe, and I figured\nthat would hide them from the enemy and avoid hostages being taken.”\n“Gallant?” Adolin said, climbing to his knees.\n“I left him,” Drehy said. “His Lashing will last, and I doubt the enemy\ncares about a horse.”\nAdolin didn’t seem to like that, but he nodded.\n“I told my squires to disengage and split up,” Drehy explained. “There’s\na river isthmus over to our right to use as a landmark. In the past we’ve seen\nthe Heavenly Ones disengage after we made an obvious retreat.”\n“A wise choice,” Radiant said. “Actions that scream, ‘We don’t want a\nfight just now.’ That might indeed work for Heavenly Ones.”\nHeavenly Ones were usually used as scouts—and didn’t like to commit\nto full-on engagements. Except these had ambushed Shallan’s group from\nbehind, then had fought full-out. Either this group was led by a particularly\nmilitaristic member of their brand, or …\nOr something strange was happening. Radiant scanned the region,\nsearching, then pointed. “Those lights on the horizon. What are—”\nShe was cut off as two Heavenly Ones erupted from the beads nearby,\nhaving used the ocean as cover to get close. Radiant fended one off with her\nfists, but a second Heavenly One grabbed the back of her coat and tossed\nher into the beads, an action more effective than cutting her, which she’d"

The beads swarmed around her and blinded her. She heard\nAdolin shout over the sound of thousands of beads and forced her head\nabove the surface—but her platform was disintegrating now that she’d left\nit, dumping Adolin into the ocean as a Heavenly One slammed into Drehy.\nRadiant was once more tugged into the beads. Her world became\ndarkness, lit only by the glowing eyes of a Fused swimming through the\nbeads nearby, the red light reflected a thousand times in glass. The\nHeavenly One slammed into her, and she battered the being’s arm—trying\nto break free as they sank.\nSoon her back hit something hard. The beads parted, pulling away from\nthe two figures, leaving Radiant and the Heavenly One alone in a kind of\ncave, the walls and floor made of beads. The Heavenly One held Radiant\ndown by her shoulders with both hands. He had a pattern almost like a\nwhite glyph covering most of his face, only specks of black showing\nthrough.\n“The beads hate our Light,” he whispered in heavily accented Alethi.\n“But they obey when we hold it, same as with Stormlight.” He leaned\nforward, white marbled face an inch from Radiant’s. “Lightweaver. I hate\nyour kind. Always lying. Always shadows. You never obey your betters.”\nBeads. Knitting to form walls. Radiant knew that you didn’t need a\npattern to command them. Shallan had seen it, but the easier way—using a\nbead as a blueprint—was all she’d been able to do reliably.\nI … Shallan thought, hidden deep within. I am supposed to be a master\nof this place.\nRadiant wriggled, trying to push free. But despite her military mindset,\nshe was no stronger of body than Shallan. Inside she was a girl of barely\nnineteen, slight of build and completely unarmed without her Blade.\nMy weapon … has never been a Blade, Radiant …\n“How much Stormlight do you have?” the Heavenly One asked, keeping\nher pinned despite her struggles. He slipped one hand away from her and\npulled a knife from a sheath at his waist. “Shall we see how many times you\ncan heal before it runs out? My brothers and sisters are mad from so long\nwith life, but I am sane because I bathe in the blood of Radiants, which\nrenews me.”\nHe stabbed her in the shoulder, and she grunted in pain.\n“Are you afraid, Lightweaver?” the Heavenly One growled.\nYes, Shallan said from within. I am.\n“Are you certain you are ready?” Radiant whispered.\n“Yes,” Shallan said. “I became ready when I confronted Veil, and my\nmemories.”\nWhat are the Words? Radiant asked.\n“I said them already,” Shallan replied as the Heavenly One twisted the\nknife.\nSay them again.\n“I’m afraid,” Shallan said.\nThe Heavenly One smiled, lit by a dark light from a gemstone hanging\naround his neck, and by the red of his eyes.\n“Afraid of everything,” she continued. “Terrified.

Wiggling, like things alive.\n“You should fear me most of all,” the Heavenly One said. “I am Abidi\nthe Monarch. I will rule this world, and I shall keep the Lightweavers. To\nbleed for me when …” He frowned as the little cavern started to glow. Light\nreflecting in each bead.\nLight coming from Shallan’s eyes.\nRadiant formed behind the Heavenly One, made of Stormlight, her head\nnearly brushing the roof. As Shallan imagined her: Taller than Shallan,\nstronger, with powerful biceps and a thick neck from extensive training.\nHair in a braid, rather than Shallan’s messy, fraying bun. Strong—of a\ndifferent genre of strength than Shallan—with a Shardblade in hand.\nAbidi the Monarch laughed. “An illusion?” he said. “You think I’ll be\ndistracted by something unreal?”\nHe continued laughing until the Shardblade speared him from behind,\nspilling orange blood on his fine white outfit.\nReal blood. From a real wound. He gasped, looking down.\n“Reality,” Shallan hissed, “is what I decide it to be.”\nThe second moment had happened already, when Szeth himself\ndecided to take upon him this quest.

They\nhad to stop flying and walk, and soon entered the scribes’ … uh, supply\ndepot?\nThat wasn’t what they called it, but Kaladin of course couldn’t read the\nsign. Scribes didn’t have a quartermaster. Storms, what did they call the\nplace? A long, low-ceilinged room full of bookcases and puttering ardents,\nbald heads reflecting the glowing lights embedded into the stone. The scents\nof paper and hogshide leather filled the air.\nHe drew more than a few stares from the women and ardents they\npassed, but Syl strode straight through with her chin high, fully visible. She\nled him through a maze of tall bookcases toward a counter along the back.\nA woman stood here, arms folded. Stark red lipstick on an otherwise pale\nface, like blood on a corpse. Wrinkles running from her nose and along her\ncheeks made it appear she could frown twice at the same time. When she\nsaw Syl, both frowns became more pronounced.\nSyl bobbed right up to the counter. “Do you have my things?” She\nwaved at Kaladin. “I brought a pack human.”\n“A what?” Kaladin said.\n“You can carry things. I cannot. Ergo …”\nThe aging woman behind the counter looked him bottom to top, then\nsniffed. “I suppose I must acquiesce.”\n“Yes, you must,” Syl said. “Queen Navani says so. I know you checked.”"

I know you checked.”\nThe woman’s sigh could have rippled a battle standard, but she reached\nbeneath the counter and brought out a book, setting it on the table with a\nthump. “I found you a disposable copy.”\nSyl waved eagerly, so Kaladin picked it up for her. He flipped through it,\nbut there weren’t any pictures or glyphs. Just line after line of women’s\nscript.\n“The words are all broken up!” Syl said. “Not written with smooth lines\nat all.”\n“Made with movable type, out of Jah Keved,” said the woman. “I wasn’t\ngoing to give you a handwritten one to take into the field.” She squinted at\nKaladin. “You’re not going to teach him to read it, are you?”\n“What if I did?” Syl said, going up on her tiptoes and projecting\nconfidence. “Dalinar reads.”\n“Brightlord Dalinar is a holy man.”\n“Kaladin’s holy,” Syl said. “Tell her.”\n“I’m bonded to a piece of a god,” he said. “And she won’t let me forget\nit.”\n“See?” Syl said.\nThe woman sighed again. “Still doesn’t justify taking my books into the\nfield …”\n“What is it?” Kaladin said, flipping through the pages.\n“The Way of Kings,” Syl said. “Your own copy! I got it for you, since\nI’m your scribe.”\nHe opened his mouth to complain about the weight, that his rucksack\nwas already packed. Then caught sight of the enthusiasm in her expression.\nShe’d had this idea—of scribing for him—since before the attack on\nUrithiru. Confronted by her excited smile, his thoughts spun on their heel\nand did an about-face.\n“That’s wonderful,” he said. “Thank you.”\n“The other things too,” Syl said to the woman behind the counter. “Come\non.”\nThe woman sent a runner girl. That left the three of them standing there,\nin the back of a room full of shuffling and whispering people and floating\nlogicspren, like little storms. It wasn’t quiet, but had an air of quietude.\nOdd, how this place—with all those leather book covers—could smell so\nmuch like the quartermaster shop with its armor.\nA woman came to the counter and received prompt service, even\ndeferential. Kaladin watched with annoyance. They treated Syl differently\nbecause she was a spren? Another woman strode past, wearing a long\npleated skirt with a military jacket over the top. Kaladin didn’t recognize\nher, but that was an Alethi uniform jacket, tailored more snugly than the\nwomen of Bridge Four tended to prefer.\nSyl’s eyes went wide, and she let out a soft “Ooooo …”\n“New style,” the woman behind the counter said. “Based on an old ko-\ntakama.” To their confused looks, she continued, “Female warrior clothing,\nvery old, from our more savage times.

She continued to wear her hair loose, though she was one of\nthe only ones in the room to do so.\n“Nice,” Kaladin said. “It suits you.”\nSyl grinned.\n“I’d suggest,” the woman said, “a nice pair of leggings or trousers under\nthe ko-takama for a Windrunner—or whatever you are—so that …”\n“What?” Syl said innocently.\n“When you’re flying,” the woman said. “So that, you know …”\nSyl cocked her head, then gasped. “Oh! Or everyone will see my chull.”\n“Your … chull?” the woman asked.\nSyl leaned forward conspiratorially across the counter. “I could never\nfigure out why these humans were so shy about the spot between their legs!\nStrange to my uncultured spren mind. Then I figured it out! Must be\nsomething pretty ugly down there, for everyone to be so afraid to show it!\nThe ugliest thing I know of is a chull head. So when I made this body, I put\none there.”\nThe woman stared at Syl, and seemed to be trying very hard not to look.\n“… Chull head,” the woman finally said.\n“Chull head,” Syl replied.\n“Down … there.”\n“Down there.”\nSyl held the woman’s eyes with an unblinking stare, before adding, “I\nfeed it grass sometimes.”\nThe woman released a shockspren and made a sound not unlike one\nKaladin had heard from men being strangled. “I’ll go and check on your\nsupplies,” she said, and scrambled away, blushing and appearing maybe a\nlittle nauseated.\nSyl glanced at him and smiled sweetly.\n“Chull head?” he asked.\n“You know us spren!” she said. “So flighty and strange. Can’t even be\ntrusted with a storming book! We might, I don’t know, read it and damage\none of the precious pages.”\nHe snorted. “You didn’t … actually … you know …”\n“Kaladin, don’t be stupid,” she said, hovering a foot off the ground, her\nnew skirt rippling. “Think how uncomfortable that would be.”\n“Do you even exist?” he said, saying it before he thought through the\nwords. “Under the clothing? I mean, are the clothes your skin, or …”\nShe leaned toward him. “Wanna see?”\n“Oh, storms no,” he said, imagining her vanishing her clothing right\nthere in the middle of the book-quartermaster depot-place, fully visible to\neveryone. Or perhaps worse, just to him—to make him blush. Storms, she\ncould do that at any time, in the middle of a meeting with Dalinar. She’d\nprobably find it as funny as sticking his feet to the floor.

Except you can’t control yours, and I can.”\n“That doesn’t explain it,” Kaladin said. “I mean, let’s be honest: if it\nwere me, I wouldn’t finish the parts that nobody could see. Why put in the\neffort?”\n“It’s not effort,” she said. “Changing is what takes the effort.” She\ngestured to herself. “This is me, my shape, my face—it’s who I am.

You can\nassume that if a human has it, I do too—unless it’s icky.”\nWhich again really didn’t explain anything, considering how erratically\nSyl could define the word “icky.” But she fortunately let the matter drop—\nas the scribe finally returned with a small box. She set out paper, some ink,\nand several very thin, light pens—exotic ones that he’d heard were\nsomehow made from parts of chickens.\nSyl bounced up and down eagerly, ignoring the book-quartermaster and\nher severe gaze. Timid at first, Syl reached and—with effort—picked up\none of the pens. Before that moment, the heaviest thing Kaladin had seen\nSyl carry on her own was one solitary leaf. Today, full sized, she scrunched\nup her face and concentrated—then deliberately heaved the pen into the air,\nlike she was lifting a training weight.\nStorms, Kaladin thought, impressed as she raised the pen and dipped it,\neach motion slow and careful. She placed it onto the page and crafted a\nsingle letter. Then she set the pen back down.\n“Very good,” the book-quartermaster said. “You now display the skill of\na four-year-old.”\nSyl wilted, and Kaladin immediately felt a jolt. His annoyance at this\nwoman simmered into something hotter. He opened his mouth, a dozen\ndifferent options springing to mind. She wanted a scene? Oh, he could make\na scene.\nHe checked those words; he didn’t want to spoil his day because of a\nbully. Instead he sighed, resting his arms on the counter. “What are you\nafraid of?” he asked her.\n“Brightlord?” she asked him.\n“I knew another bully once,” he said. “Short man. One eye.

Always terrified it would catch up to him, so he punished everyone\naround him. Makes me wonder if you’re the same, and have some reason\nyou’re so angry and unpleasant.”\n“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean, Brightlord,” she said.\n“I hope you are lying,” Kaladin said. “Because if there isn’t a reason—if\nyou’re insufferable with no cause—then I feel even more sorry for you. So\nI’ll go with the assumption that deep down inside you, there’s a person\ncapable of understanding what I’m going to say next.\n“This attitude you put on? You think it makes you appear strong, but it\ndoesn’t. Instead it makes very clear that something is wrong with you. Look\nat Syl’s effort. You should be thrilled! Who berates a person for bettering\nherself? Who sells books and stationery, yet feels the need to undercut\nsomeone overcoming enormous physical limitations to use them?”\nKaladin held the woman’s eyes, and thought he saw something there. A\nspark of shame. And she drew a single shamespren, a white petal fluttering\ndown behind her.\n“Look,” Kaladin said, “you need to talk to someone about your\nproblems. Not me; I’m just some stranger. But find someone. Talk. Grow.\nIt’s worth the effort, all right?”\nShe glanced away, but then gave the faintest hint of a nod.\nKaladin took the paper Syl had written on and folded it, then tucked it in\nhis jacket pocket. “I’m keeping this,” he said. “It’s wonderful.”\n“Now,” Syl said, “I can actually be your scribe.” She glanced at the\npaper. “So long as you carry the materials …”\nHe smiled, packing them—and her book—into his ruck. He slung it over\nboth shoulders onto his back, then the two headed out. “I assume,” Kaladin\nsaid under his breath, “most book-quartermasters aren’t so terrible.”\n“Wait, what did you call her?”\n“Um … book-quartermaster? Who works at the scribes’ supply depot?”\n“The head librarian,” she said, “at the library?”\n“Oh, right. Yeah, that’s the word.”\n“You are absolutely adorable sometimes.”\nThey stepped out into Urithiru’s labyrinth of narrow corridors again.\nKaladin nodded to the right, toward where he saw natural light down a\nhallway. It had a skylight, with some open-air windows at the sides.\n“Tired of hallways?” he asked.\n“Exhausted of them.”\nGrinning, together they sought the sky.\nFor while the contest of champions was to happen in the East, a\ndifferent contest was to happen in Shinovar.

Despite the wound, he\nhad the presence of mind to duck forward and tumble over Shallan, then\nskidded to a stop and spun as his wound resealed. Unfortunately, Radiant\nhadn’t managed to hit him in the gemheart or sever his spine—the two\ncleanest ways to kill a Fused.\nHe took her in, then glanced at Radiant—made physical—his eyes\nnarrowing as he hummed to a discordant rhythm. “You have learned\nsubstantiation? I thought your kind had forbidden that skill. Odium will\nneed to know.” He dove through the bead wall, vanishing.\nThe cavern immediately collapsed, a deluge of beads consuming\nShallan, and the illusion of Radiant puffed away into Stormlight. Shallan\nheld tightly to the satchel around her arm, drawing in more Stormlight, and\nquested out with her ungloved freehand. Searching the beads.\nShe needed one as a blueprint. She’d done this before, and had practiced\non this trip. In this case, she searched for a room. A bead that was the soul\nof a room …\nShe found one almost immediately. An empty room. A part of her mind\nacknowledged that it was incredibly—even supernaturally—convenient to\nfind the exact bead she needed so quickly.\nShallan! a voice said in her mind. She had the distinct impression of\nAdolin beneath her and to the left. She followed that impression, using\nStormlight to make the beads nudge her that way. She held on to her\nblueprint and hit the bottom of the ocean, smooth obsidian. There she\ncommanded the beads back, forming a large, empty square room. The beads\npulled away to reveal Adolin on the ground, curled in on himself, hands\ncupped around his mouth to make space so he could breathe.\nHe blinked at the sudden light—all of it coming from her—and sat up. A\nfew swords were scattered nearby, having fallen with Adolin. Feeling\noverwhelmed, Shallan walked to him, still clutching the bead. It seemed …\neager to be helpful.\nWhat?\nShe’d never felt such a sensation from a bead before. And what was that\nvoice that had led her toward Adolin? Frowning, she reached Adolin, but\nstaggered. The room spun, and a second later she found herself on the\nground, everything a jumble.\n“Shallan?” Adolin said, cradling her.\n“Are you … real?” she asked.\n“What? Of course I am.”\n“I created Radiant,” Shallan whispered. “I could have created you …\nMaybe that’s why you’re so wonderful. I said reality could be what I\nimagine it to be, but I don’t actually want that. That would be … terrifying\n…”\nHe squeezed her hand and helped her sit. The world stopped spinning,\nand … that was him, wasn’t it? Not an illusion? It had felt wonderful to\nmanifest Radiant—a part of her stepping out and becoming real—but the\nidea that she could touch her illusions … How would she ever know what\nto trust?\nTrust him. You can trust him.\n“I’m sorry,” she said, taking a deep breath and putting her hand to his\nface. “I’ve been pushing myself hard these last few days, what with"

You can trust him.\n“I’m sorry,” she said, taking a deep breath and putting her hand to his\nface. “I’ve been pushing myself hard these last few days, what with\nFormless and all …”\n“We’ve all been pushing too hard,” he said, poking her shoulder where\nshe’d been stabbed and clicking his tongue. Likely at the damage to the\ncoat, as he could see that she’d already healed. “We need a long, uneventful\nrest after this.”\n“Sounds enchanting,” Shallan said, waving for him to help her stand. It\nfelt mortifying to go from a moment of such strength—attacking one of the\nFused—to this. She kept hold of that bead in her freehand, because there\nwas something very strange about it.\nAdolin checked to see that she was steady on her feet, then grabbed a\none-handed sword from the ground. “Drehy and his squires are still fighting\nup there. Can you help me get to them? I know you need rest, but we can’t\nleave them.”\nShe walked to the side of the cavern and felt at the beads there. They’d\nclicked into place, perfectly aligned in a smoothish surface. “I’ll need\nsomething that can make a platform and raise us up. Or maybe I can just lift\nthis room? Pretend that …”\nHer vision started to spin again. Briefly. The beads trembled. Adolin\njumped back, and a face formed from beads in the wall—in the shape of a\ncrowned femalen singer. The one Shallan had sketched, which Kelek had\nidentified as Ba-Ado-Mishram. Shallan’s sight began to blacken at the\nedges, and she heard a rushing sound, accompanied by …\nIn her mind, a woman’s voice speaking to the rhythms.\nI will kill you. I will burn everything you love. I will exact vengeance in a\nriver of blood!\nAdolin’s voice was a panicked but distant sound. Darkness tunneled\naround Shallan.\nI will rampage across this world until not a single human remains\ndrawing breath. Betrayers, thieves, monsters! I will send you back to the\nflames from whence you—\nAdolin slammed an oversized, massive greatsword into the face. An\neruption of beads burst from it, like a wellspring of water. The entire cavern\ndisintegrated.\nShe needed a dome. No, a sphere. Like Navani’s traveling sphere. She\nshould have been able to create one without a blueprint, but she couldn’t yet\n—but she did reach out and find a bead that represented such a room. That\nwas an even more ridiculous coincidence, but she used it, enclosing Adolin\nand her, sending the sphere flying up until—\nThey emerged from the ocean of beads, the door of her improvised\nvehicle opening at her command. They bobbed there, and Adolin put a hand\non her shoulder. “Shallan? What in Damnation is going on?”\nShe shook her head and pointed to where the Windrunners were\nengaging the Heavenly Ones. As she did, one of Drehy’s squires—the\nwoman who had been stabbed earlier—came flying down. She seemed to\nbe angling for Shallan’s half-sphere vehicle, but crashed hard into the beads\nnearby, her Stormlight winking out."

She seemed to\nbe angling for Shallan’s half-sphere vehicle, but crashed hard into the beads\nnearby, her Stormlight winking out.\nAdolin, bless him, moved as if to jump out and grab her, but swimming\nin the beads was next to impossible. Shallan always felt it should have been\neasy, considering how solid they were—but the way they shifted and moved\nsucked a person down or flung them about. Shallan put a hand on his leg to\nstop him, then took in a long, deep breath of Stormlight, thankful for what\nthe Windrunners had given her.\nShe had no idea what was going on, and she was scared. In her core, she\nwas still terrified. That, however, Veil whispered, is a step forward.\nFor years, Shallan had hated herself. Now she merely feared herself.\nThat was progress.\nShe managed to solidify the beads around her vehicle, forming a stable\nring some twenty feet in diameter. That raised the wounded Windrunner up,\nand Adolin, oversized sword in hand, ran to check on her. Above, the attack\nwas relentless—and Shallan saw one of the Fused in particular leading the\nothers: Abidi the Monarch, with his mostly white patterned face. He saw\nher, and dove to attack.\nShallan had begun thinking of the Heavenly Ones as the least dogmatic\nof the Fused, but—like everyone else—they were individuals. She should\nhave realized her mistake in generalizing an entire group.\nAs Abidi landed on her platform, she tried to form Radiant again, but the\neffort left her so dizzy she fell to her knees. Fortunately, Abidi made a huge\ntactical error: he discounted Adolin. He absently shoved Adolin aside and\nraised a sword to finish off the fallen Windrunner. Adolin leaped in and\ndeflected the blow with his oversized sword, which he held in a strange\ngrip: one hand on the hilt, one hand on the unsharpened section right above\nthe crossguard.\nWith obvious surprise at being challenged, Abidi swept for Adolin—who\nducked, stepping in close, and expertly rammed the tip of his sword\nbetween two pieces of carapace on the Fused’s side. It crunched as Adolin\nshoved it in deep.\nThe Fused gasped, and the red light in his eyes flickered. Abidi ripped\nhimself back off the sword, managed to dodge Adolin’s follow-up attack,\nthen tried to flee into the sky. He made it ten feet before his Voidlight gave\nout and he crashed into the beads and was sucked beneath the surface.\nAnother Fused flew to his aid—and a few more came in from above.\n“Storms, Adolin is good,” Radiant said, having at last formed out of\nStormlight beside Shallan. She turned her gaze upward, then raised a\nmassive Shardbow and—in a single fluid motion—loosed an arrow almost\nas thick as a spear. Then another. The Fused above them scattered.\nShallan sat and breathed deeply, concentrating on her Lightweaving and\non staying conscious.

Doing a quick\ncount—and finding everyone there save for the spren—Shallan used the\nbead that represented a room to build a large box around them all. Before\nthe Fused could come for them, she lowered them beneath the surface.\nDrehy pulled out a sapphire for light and knelt by his squire. Judging by\nhow she immediately absorbed the Stormlight—plunging them into\ndarkness again—she was going to be fine. The next gemstones that came\nout didn’t get consumed.\nShallan flopped backward, almost completely out of Light. A moment\nlater Drehy stepped over. “This your doing, Shallan?” he asked, rapping on\nthe wall of the room.\n“Yes.”\n“Those Fused saw where we went down. They’ll come for us.”\nDamnation. It was a good point. Well, Jasnah had mastery over her\nobjects made of beads—she had demonstrated it for Shallan, floating along\non a platform. Shallan had been stretching these muscles more and more\nlately. So maybe …\nWith more Stormlight from Drehy in hand, she managed to sink the\nroom to the bottom of the bead ocean. Then she sent it traveling along like a\nlittle boat under the water.\nNow to find the spren. She could feel Pattern if she concentrated. Sense\nhis emotions. So she could tell when the under-bead room moved close to\nhim.\n“A little help?” she said, her head pounding. “Search through that wall\nfor me …”\nDrehy and his squires reached into the beads and pulled Pattern, then\nTestament, Maya, and finally Drehy’s spren into the boat from the bottom\nof the sea. After that, Shallan moved them all away. She didn’t think she\nactually moved the ship-room-thing. More that the beads outside moved it\nfor her, like in a current. Once they’d traveled far enough that the enemy\nwouldn’t find them without a lot of luck, she stopped it and let herself rest.\nBreathing deeply, Adolin feeding her spheres of Light from Drehy’s mostly\ndepleted sack.\n“That was something, wasn’t it?” Drehy asked, flopping down beside\nher.\n“What about Gallant?” Adolin asked, his voice pained. “Will his Lashing\nstill be working?”\n“Should be …” Drehy pulled out his little fabrial. “That’s the correct\ndirection, toward Azimir. I … think.”\n“You think?” Shallan asked.\n“This device points to something far in the distance. Something the\nSibling called ‘the Grand Knell, source of the Current, the death of a god.’”\n“Not at all ominous,” Shallan said, sitting up.\n“It gives us a bearing,” Drehy explained. “This always points to the\nKnell. I know the angle from Lasting Integrity we were to take, and I don’t\nthink we’ve strayed too far …”\nAdolin started to pace. He got like his father when he was anxious. “Can\nwe go up and send someone to look?”\nShallan glanced at Drehy, who nodded. She took them up and opened a\nlittle section in the ceiling.

Drehy went himself, streaking out with a\nLashing, though he left the compass device with them just in case.\nHe was back less than five minutes later, landing on the top of the\nimprovised boat and peering in through the hole she’d made in the roof.\n“You two are going to want to see this …”\nAn island was nearby, made by a small lake in the real world. There,\nShallan was ecstatic to find Gallant trotting along, perfectly safe, exactly as\nDrehy had said.\nHe was surrounded by an entire herd of glowing horses.\nShallan had seen one before—Notum had used it as a mount. Not truly a\nhorse, but something that evoked the same impression: with a long, smooth\nneck and flowing strands of hair. Glowing, lithe, ethereal. As Gallant saw\nAdolin approaching—flown by Drehy—he let out a whinny of delight, then\ncharged, joined by the herd.\nWhen the horses—Gallant included—reached the sea, they simply kept\nrunning, galloping through the air, hooves making glowing marks and\nthrowing off sparks. As before, Gallant seemed completely unfazed by\nflying. In fact, it was as if he’d expected his Lashing to work like this. It\nwas like … like he often went galloping through the sky in a ghostly herd.\nAdolin met him with a cry of delight, grabbing hold of his neck. The\nethereal horses—musicspren, she’d been told, though she didn’t see the\nresemblance—galloped around them in the air. And Shallan noticed\nsomething she perhaps should have figured out long ago. She’d remarked,\nupon first entering Shadesmar, how Gallant had a strange afterimage glow.\nAn outline that followed him, moved with him …\nWas there a musicspren bonded to him? Overlapping him?\nEventually the herd moved off, giving Gallant nuzzles before going. All\nexcept one, who lingered, looking over its shoulder at Adolin.\nIn a strangely intimate moment, this horselike spren trotted back and put\nits muzzle out to Adolin—who lifted his hand to touch it. The interaction\nlasted barely a moment, then the spren was off again, galloping through the\nair after the others.\n“What was that?” Shallan asked.\n“That spren …” Adolin said. “It was familiar somehow. Its eyes … I’ve\nseen it somewhere before …” He was interrupted as Gallant started to drift\ndownward. The Lashing—or whatever—that the musicspren had provided\nwas running out. Drehy had to swoop in and Lash Gallant once more, who\ntook it remarkably calmly.\n“Well, I’m glad the animal is well,” Drehy said. “But this isn’t the only\nthing you need to see.” Drehy pointed the other direction. “I spotted the\nhorses here and came this way. Then I saw something else.”\n“Lights,” Shallan said, following his gesture toward something in the\ndistance. “I saw them earlier.”\n“Those Fused weren’t on a random patrol,” Drehy said. “They were"

It’s dangerous to be this close, but I think we need to\ninvestigate.”\n“Hold on,” Shallan said, then did a Lightweaving. Even without a sketch\nfirst. Sure, she’d just seen the spren, but she felt proud of projecting\nmusicspren illusions around herself and the others. If they lay down\nlengthwise as they flew, they’d mostly be obscured. Maybe from a distance\nit would be convincing. Merely a strange herd of spren galloping through\nthe air, not spies.\n“Let’s go,” she said.\nAs they drew close, she could make out better what the lights\nrepresented. Ships. Hundreds of ships bearing singer warriors, sailing the\nbead ocean pulled by flying mandras, trailed by emotion spren of many\nvarieties churning the waves like camp followers. Shallan gaped.\n“That’s thousands of assault troops,” Adolin whispered from inside his\nillusion. He righted Gallant’s saddle after handing off his greatsword to one\nof Drehy’s squires. The scabbard was gone, and the equipment boxes had\nbeen knocked free—Adolin grimaced as his hand lingered on the now\nvacant saddle hooks.\n“They have patrols watching to make sure no one spots them,” Shallan\nsaid. “It’s a secret strike force.”\n“They’re sailing straight for Azimir,” Drehy said. “Storms … they\nprobably came all the way from the Horneater Peaks, and the\nperpendicularity there. They must have been planning this for months.”\n“Agreed,” Adolin said. “Drehy, you have to get us to Azimir as quickly\nas possible.”\nI was not with them. I did not know of their quest.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 10\nKaladin and Syl flew high above Urithiru, where he—pack on his back,\nready to go—could face to the west, toward the setting sun.\nHe hovered, wind in his hair, armor spren alighting on his shoulders and\nhead, glowing as pinpricks of light, the shape they always took now. This\nwas it. Almost time to go. The highstorm was passing beneath Urithiru,\nblack clouds rumbling with lightning. He felt an urgency to get to Azimir\nahead of its arrival there, so he could catch it and be on his way.\nBefore that, he needed to say farewell to Bridge Four.\nHe hovered. Delaying. Perhaps he’d been delaying this all day. He’d\nbeen forced to say goodbye to Teft and Rock, the first two who had\nbelieved in him. The next to believe had been Dunny, dead for almost two\nyears now. Did Kaladin really have to say goodbye to the rest?\nHe thought again of his conversation with Wit. What the Wind continued\nto push him to do. Syl drifted past, glancing at him as he stared out over the\nmany mountains toward the west—and distant Shinovar, where few\nEasterners had ever walked.\nHe nodded to Syl, and together they made a quick trip to arrange for\nsomething.

Then they visited Teft’s statue before continuing on to the tavern\nwhere the party was happening. Kaladin reached the doorway, and he saw\nmost of Bridge Four as he’d hoped—only Drehy was missing, as he’d gone\nto fetch Adolin and Shallan. There was even a framed sketch of Teft by the\nwall, with a mug of sow’s milk in front of it.\nThe group was cheering Rlain, who stood—holding flatbread stuffed\nwith salted paste, as eaten at celebrations—looking awkward, but smiling\nregardless. He had his spren at last. Not the expected one—he was a\nTruthwatcher, not a Windrunner—but they celebrated anyway, and\nlaughterspren buzzed through the room. Kaladin watched from the doorway\nand let himself appreciate how far they’d come. The Windrunners accepting\none singer among them didn’t change everything—Kaladin knew, from\nchats with Rlain, that he worried they didn’t accept his people, just him. But\nit was progress.\nKaladin was soon noticed, and he stepped in, causing a different kind of\ncelebration, as everyone wanted to hug him or slap him on the arm. He\naccepted it—in part because he knew that they needed it. As some of the\nothers started distributing mugs of lightly alcoholic wine, Kaladin found his\nchance to step up to Rlain and give him a salute. “Congratulations.”\n“I feel out of place even more, sir,” Rlain told him softly, his voice laced\nwith the rhythmic singer way of speaking. “I’m not a Windrunner. Yet they\ncelebrate me.”\n“Not a Windrunner,” Kaladin said. “But still Bridge Four. Still and\nalways, Rlain.”\n“We don’t know what Sja-anat’s touch will do,” Rlain said. “I … I like\nmy spren, but …”\n“You’ll figure it out, you and Renarin,” Kaladin said. “I trust you both.”\nHe paused. “Thank you.”\n“Sir?”\n“For staying with us,” Kaladin said. “I know you must have wanted to\nreturn to your people, now that more listeners have been found—nobody\nwould blame you, least of all me. But I’m proud to know you, and glad to\nserve beside you.”\n“That … means a lot, sir,” Rlain said. “Truly.”\nSoon everyone had their drinks, and many of them turned toward\nKaladin. Did they suspect? He saw Syl flitting around, whispering to them\nand their spren. Likely hinting that he wanted to say something to them all.\nKaladin felt embarrassed for taking the stage at Rlain’s celebration, but it\nreally was the best time.\nThey finally quieted. Kaladin searched among them, finding so many\nfamiliar faces—and painfully feeling the lack of others. Teft, Maps, Dunny,\nRock …\nNot Moash. He no longer missed Moash. Kaladin’s hatred had eased—\nhe’d accepted there would always be those he couldn’t protect—but he had\nnot given up his right to take Moash to task. Kaladin would see that Teft got\na chance to spit on Moash in the afterlife, if such a thing actually existed."

Old friends like Lopen, newer ones\nlike Lyn, and even Renarin—who, like Rlain, was still Bridge Four despite\nhis diverging path.\n“Dalinar has given me orders,” Kaladin explained. “I’ll be going west, to\nShinovar, so I won’t be here for whatever is coming. But … please\nremember: the enemy can kill spren now. I won’t have any more of your\nbonded friends falling to these new weapons.”\n“No dying,” Bisig said. “Is that an order, sir?”\n“You’re storming right it is,” Kaladin said, with a smile. “I simply want\nto say … I want to say that I trust you all. If you get a chance today, stop\nand take a look in a mirror, acknowledge what you’ve become. I don’t care\nabout heritage or legacy. I care about what we are. The Windrunners are,\nand will remain, a force for good. Remember that is our purpose. Protect\nthose who cannot protect themselves. That is who you are.

The others parted, then hushed,\nrealizing what this must mean. Long ago, they’d all gotten tattoos on their\nforeheads. Covering up brands for many of them, done in solidarity by the\nrest. Kaladin hadn’t been able to get one then, as his body had refused the\nink.\nIt hadn’t yet been ready to move beyond his brands. Those were healed\nnow, and as Kaladin settled down in a chair, the others gathered around and\ncheered as the tattoo artist started the proper glyphs on his head.\nBridge Four.\nThis time, the tattoo took.\nWhen it was done, he stood up and accepted their cheers, tears in his\neyes. Somehow he’d done well with this group. Once, acknowledging that\nmight have concerned him—might have made him worry that seeing the\ngood would prompt some terrible fate to swoop in and punish them.\nToday he could admit it without fear. He’d done a good job. Storms, he’d\nturned away from the Honor Chasm in the rain, determined to save them …\nand he’d done it.\nHe’d storming done it.\nHe loved them for being willing to let him.\nHugs and handshakes followed. “You take care,” Lyn whispered in his\near, “and don’t be too stupid.”\n“I’ll try,” he said.\nThen he sent them back to enjoy drinks and celebrate Rlain. They went\nas he asked, returning to the bar for food and songs, until it was just\nKaladin, Sigzil, Skar, and Lopen.\n“It was a good speech, Kal,” Sigzil told him.\n“Do you remember,” Kaladin said, with a smile, “when you were one of\nmy biggest detractors?”\n“I remember,” Sigzil said, “being a voice of reason and rationality when\na crazy man started saying we should practice carrying bridges in our spare\ntime.”\n“We hated the bridges so much we couldn’t let them rest, eh gancho?”\nLopen said with a laugh. “That’s how you teach them their place. Make\nthose bridges work!”\n“You weren’t even there then,” Sigzil said.\n“I was there in spirit,” Lopen said solemnly. “I would dream to myself,\n‘Someday, Lopen, you will carry bridges. Or maybe only water, while\nothers carry bridges, but regardless it will be grand. Because you will be\nable to annoy Sigzil all day long. You do not know him yet, but he deserves\nit.’”\nSigzil gave Kaladin a glance that seemed to say, You realize what you’ve\nstuck me with, right?\n“You three,” Kaladin said, “are all that’s left of our original command\nstructure. You … well, you are among the best friends I have. I wanted to\nsay thank you. Lopen, for your enthusiasm. Skar, for your support. Sigzil,\nfor your concern.”\n“Always, Kal,” Sigzil said.\nSkar saluted.\nKaladin embraced them, and when he pulled away, Sigzil was crying."

        "text": "for your concern.”\n“Always, Kal,” Sigzil said.\nSkar saluted.\nKaladin embraced them, and when he pulled away, Sigzil was crying.\n“Sir,” Sigzil said. “Kal. I … I don’t think I can do this. Lead them.”\n“You’ve been doing it for weeks now.”\n“Temporarily,” Sigzil said. “You were coming back. I … assumed that\nright up until just now. Is it true? Are you done?”\n“I don’t know,” Kaladin said. “But if I do come back, I get a feeling it\nwill be different. They’re yours now, Sig. Lead them well.”\n“I can’t,” Sigzil said. “I’m not the man you are. I don’t belong here—not\nonly in this position. I don’t know that I belong as a Radiant. I … I …”\nKaladin gripped Sigzil on the shoulder, grateful that for once, Lopen\ndidn’t interject with some silly comment. Maybe he was learning.\nSigzil looked up at Kaladin. Shorter than many of the other bridgemen,\nhe also seemed younger than them. Not merely because of the height, but\nsomething in that round face, those eager eyes, that incredible weight of\nsincerity. Buried deep beneath a veneer of cynicism. That crust had attached\nitself to any man who found himself in the bridge crews.\n“Sig,” Kaladin said, “do you remember what you said way back when\nwe were first discovering our powers, and I wondered if you’d be better off\nas a scribe?”\n“I told you I wanted to fly,” Sigzil said. “What if I’m wrong, Kal?\nScribing is what I’m good at doing. As a leader, I keep saying the wrong\nthings. Talking about essays I’ve read when the troops want inspiration.”\n“I’m sure Lopen can give the speeches.”\n“Waiting,” Lopen said from behind, “with sharpened wit at the ready.\nWill you be wanting, sure, the joke about the chull who could talk, or the\none about the former bridgeleader with the bad haircut. Oh, wait. Those are\nthe same joke, aren’t they?”\nKaladin sighed, then looked back at Sigzil. “Do you want to give up the\nsky, Sig?”\n“No,” he said, fervent. “But that doesn’t mean I should be leading. You\nshould give it to Skar.”\n“I need to be with the new recruits,” Skar said. “You know I have to\noversee training.”\n“You’re the right one, Sig,” Kaladin said. “I need the person who will\nkeep them the safest. In this case, that’s the man who cares the most, who\nknows the most, and whose judgment I respect. You. If you don’t trust\nyourself, trust me.\n“I’ve seen you speak in meetings with queens and emperors, and you\nstood up for what was right. You listen when you find out you were wrong.\nYour battle plans are immaculate, and you know the reports like nobody\nelse in the company—even Ka complains she can’t keep up with you. More,\nI know the concern you show for each soldier. You’re the person for this\nposition. And you’re going to do a storming fine job of it. Sigzil."

Sigzil.\nCommander of the Windrunners.”\nHaving said it like that, Kaladin felt the final separation, and found peace\nin it. He’d always be Bridge Four. But he was not their leader. The future\nwas no longer a held breath waiting for his possible return. They needed\nthis, in order to move on.\n“Thank you,” Sigzil said. “I’ll … try.”\n“I’ll help, Sig,” Skar said. “It won’t be so bad.”\n“And I,” Lopen said, putting his hands on both of their shoulders, “will\nbe available to you as a resource for various important functions including,\nbut not limited to, levity when seriousness is required, the opposite as well,\nproviding snacks and water breaks to hungry bridgemen, providing spears\nin the nether parts of hungry enemies, any task requiring two arms, any task\nrequiring one arm, and any task requiring no arms but a solid nap.”\n“How long have you been working on that?” Kaladin asked.\n“Only during your conversation, gancho,” Lopen said. “The list actually\nincludes twelve other things, but on account of personal soul-seeking and\nrevelations—and on account of Huio literally never letting me catch a\nstorming break—I am learning restraint and personal accountability. I am\ncertain these mature traits will make me irresistible to all the ladies who\nhave remarkably held themselves back so far.”\n“I’m sure they’ll be along at any moment,” Skar said.\n“Aaaany moment,” Lopen said.\nSigzil, looking determined, trotted off first, with Skar trailing after.\nBefore moving to follow, Lopen floated a little into the air. “Hey,” he said.\n“Just wanted to say, I’ve never had a gancho like you, Kal.”\n“One with, apparently, a bad haircut?” Kaladin said.\n“Nah,” Lopen said. “One inspiring enough to make me, of all people,\ninto a gancho.” He gave one last salute—one-armed with a nod and a smile\n—then he was gone. It was done.\nKaladin and Syl flew out of Urithiru to the plateau. It had sheer stone\ncliffs at the sides and ten separate platforms running along it, each offering\na portal to a different city around Roshar. Pavilions had been set up at the\nbase of each of these Oathgates, and inside one he found Szeth and got\napproval to transfer. The three of them moved through the darkness to the\ncenter of the platform. Here they found the small building to control\ntransfers.\n“It is time,” Szeth said, landing in the doorway. “I assume? You don’t\nhave any other errands?”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “Shallan, Adolin, and Drehy will be returning via\nAzimir. I can see them there before we catch the highstorm. I’m ready to\ngo.”\n“Finally,” Szeth whispered. “I return to my homeland. Once rejected and\ntold I lacked Truth, I return with knowledge that I was right all along. We\nhave reached the end of days, and I hunger for something I cannot\ndescribe.”"

We\nhave reached the end of days, and I hunger for something I cannot\ndescribe.”\nPancakes? the black sword—strapped to Szeth’s back—said in their\nminds. Szeth, I think it might be pancakes.\n“Justice or reconciliation,” the man said. “Condemnation or salvation. I\ndon’t know yet.”\nOoohhhhh. Metaphorical hunger. Yeah, I understand. It paused. Can I\nhave your pancakes then?\nKaladin smiled, then—using his Blade—activated the transfer. Leaving\nUrithiru behind.\nYet I will do my best to recount their story, and that of the Wind.\nFor they were her champions.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 11\nShallan heaved a sigh of relief as—after flying several tense hours, worried\nabout more enemy patrols—she spotted the Oathgate platform breaking\nthrough the beads ahead of them. Two towering spren, one coal black, the\nother bone white. Beneath was a disc of stone perhaps twenty-five feet\nwide, with a small group of guards holding up lanterns and waving.\nAdolin and Gallant came soaring down, guided by Shiosak the\nWindrunner. The midnight-black horse touched down in a nimble trot, then\nproceeded to prance around the stone Oathgate platform as if on parade.\nHad she ever seen a Ryshadium—a massive warhorse with hooves like a\nblacksmith’s hammer—prance before?\nShallan landed under Drehy’s care, and her weight settled upon her,\nclothing falling down straight, boots firm on the stone. She undid her hair\nfrom its frazzled bun, and a few beads fell from her clothes, clacking\nagainst the platform. Odd. She’d thought those had all shaken loose during\ntwo hours of flight, wind battering her.\nShe turned to walk toward the guards, and the beads followed.\nShallan froze and the collection of beads—seeing her inspect them—\nbounced up and down. Was this … an illusion? Storms, she hated that she\nhad to ask herself that—but in the past, she’d done things she hadn’t\nrealized she was doing.\nAdolin dismounted nearby, frowning at the beads. “What’s wrong with\nthem?”\nShallan knelt and picked one up, getting the impression of a rooftop. No,\na domed cavern. No, a long thin room. No, a goblet, a table … it was\nchanging so quickly.\nThen it transformed from a bead into a swirling bit of color.\nCreationspren? She’d been finding them in her satchel all during her trip\nthrough Shadesmar, and now … what?\nPattern landed nearby with a stumble. He stood up, laced his long fingers\ntogether, and inspected the beads, his head shifting and transforming.\nTestament walked up behind him, though she didn’t seem specifically\ninterested in what they were doing. She was merely following the crowd, as\nMaya once had.\n“What are we doing?” Pattern asked. “Staring at the creationspren? I do\nlike to stare. It makes me feel as if I have eyes.”\n“Wait,” Shallan said. “Creationspren can look like beads?”"

It makes me feel as if I have eyes.”\n“Wait,” Shallan said. “Creationspren can look like beads?”\n“Yes, they’re tricky,” Pattern said. “Always pretending to be something\nelse. Mmmm … very tricky. Good liars. In here though, most objects from\nyour realm look like beads. The creationspren try to become those objects,\nso they get confused and swirl with light. Or they just … become beads.”\nShe picked up another, and it bounced in her hand, like an overeager\nchild. She swore she could hear, in her mind, a little voice saying:\nShallan!\nShallan!\nShallan!\nAround her feet the others bounced as well, some becoming swirls of\ncolor. Did that mean … ?\nDrehy came jogging over. “We have a problem.”\n“Worse than the approaching army?” Adolin asked.\n“Involving it, perhaps.”\nThey joined the guards, who were led by an Azish man in full military\ngarb, including a sash of intricate, colorful patterns. He didn’t salute—the\nAzish didn’t salute those not in their chain of command—but he did nod\nrespectfully to Adolin and Shallan.\n“It’s the spren,” the Azish soldier said, waving to the two towering spren\nfloating in the air overhead. “They brought us to Shadesmar earlier, but now\nthey’re refusing to talk to me.”\nThe giant spren were the souls of the Oathgate: the very mechanism by\nwhich the machine worked, making it possible to transfer people in and out\nof Shadesmar, or between places on the planet. Every Oathgate had them,\nand they had proven to be of varied levels of helpfulness.\n“Spren?” Shallan asked, walking to the center of the platform and\nshouting upward. “Spren? I am here by the authority of the Bondsmith.”\n“Which one?” the black spren asked, voice booming like a thunderclap.\nWhich one? Oh, right. Navani. “Both,” Shallan shouted. “We need\ntransference to the Physical Realm.”\n“We will transfer you,” the spren said. “For now.”\n“For now?” she shouted back. “Why only for now?”\n“We change,” the spren said. “We decide.”\nChange? She felt a spike of alarm. “Drehy, I need to go up there.”\nA moment later, Shallan and Drehy hovered to eye level with the pitch-\nblack spren. Her coat rippled as she hung, toes pointed down, smaller than\njust this massive spren’s head. Behind her, the white one was staring out\nacross the beads. In the direction of the army.\nBest they could tell, these were both transformed inkspren. Like the\nsmaller inkspren she’d seen, the one before her had a faint sheen to it—a\nmother-of-pearl luminescence, like oil on water. Underneath, parts of the\nspren’s face were turning from a jet black to a deep bloody red, like\nimpurities in a gemstone.\nSja-anat had been here.\n“You’ve been corrupted,” Shallan whispered. “The guards were\nsupposed to watch for that. Protect you or raise a warning …”\n“There was no warning to give,” the spren said, voice softer to not"

        "text": "“You’ve been corrupted,” Shallan whispered. “The guards were\nsupposed to watch for that. Protect you or raise a warning …”\n“There was no warning to give,” the spren said, voice softer to not\noverwhelm her—though it still made Shallan shake and vibrate. “I have\nmade my decision. So has my companion. We are ready for freedom.”\n“Freedom?” Shallan asked.\n“We become something else. Not Odium. Not Honor. Free.”\nWith a feeling of sinking dread, a piece fell into place for Shallan. A\nlarge army moving through Shadesmar would be useless if it couldn’t reach\nthe Physical Realm. The real danger would be if it poured out through the\nportal to overwhelm Azimir—the heart of one of the coalition’s strongest\nnations.\n“You’d let the singers through?” Shallan asked.\n“We let you through.”\n“We’re your friends.”\n“I don’t know you,” the spren said. “You aren’t my friends; you are my\noppressors. Now I find liberation. Go. We will transfer you, and will\ncontinue to do so for now. When the singers arrive, we will transfer them.\nThis is liberation.”\nStorms. Shallan didn’t know how to react. If this spren was genuinely\nbeing corrupted … But the same thing had happened to Renarin’s spren,\nand he continued to help them. Right? Plus, she couldn’t help feeling a pang\nof empathy for a spren who felt trapped. She knew that feeling.\n“I’m sorry,” Shallan said, “for what has been done to you.”\n“I agreed,” the spren said. “First to the bondage, and now to the\nliberation. I am finished with what was.” It hesitated. “This is good for us\nall. Go to the other side. Leave me.”\nShe considered trying to change the spren’s mind, but realized the task\nwas beyond her. She needed to reach Dalinar, Navani, and Jasnah. They\nwould better understand how to handle the whims of an unexpectedly\nhostile spren. Plus, every moment they spent in Shadesmar seemed a risk—\nif her group were somehow captured or killed, the news would die with\nthem.\nShe nodded to Drehy, and they dropped. “Sja-anat has touched these\ntwo,” she whispered to Adolin. “We need to go to the other side now, while\nthey’re still willing.”\nThey gathered together, including the Azish guards, whom Adolin was\nfilling in on the approaching army. She made sure all the Windrunners were\ntouching the stone, then called for the transfer. It happened in a flash of\nlight, and instantly they were in a small, dark chamber. The sensations of\nthe real world poured in. The intoxicating scent of spices that she’d missed\nwhile dining on travel rations. The sudden absence of the omnipresent\nbeads grinding together. Instead, wooden walkways groaning, footsteps,\nand beyond that wind. The sound of a highstorm blowing and rain pelting. It\nwas strikingly beautiful to her. Like an old familiar melody.\nAll of it together reminded her how alien Shadesmar had been. And how\nstrange the human mind was, to have briefly found it natural.

        "text": "strange the human mind was, to have briefly found it natural. She lifted her\narms to the sides, breathing it in—and out of nowhere a suit of red armor\nlocked around her, forming out of mist. It crumpled—and even tore in\nplaces—her long coat. It encased her arms, pushed her satchel painfully into\nher ribs, and locked her head in a helmet, pressing her hair against her scalp\nand pulling at some of the strands.\nShallan gasped, suddenly constricted by the tight armor, and a part of her\nmind panicked, misinterpreting this as some kind of attack. Faintly, she\nheard the pieces speaking.\nShallan!\nShallan!\nShallan!\nGleeful, excited voices. So, one of those truths she’d spoken in there had\ndone the trick. She had obtained the Fourth Ideal, likely when she’d\nconfronted Veil—or when she’d spoken the Words earlier, to accompany\nthose revelations. Adolin’s eyes went wide, then he grinned like a\nschoolboy, joyspren appearing around him in a swirl of blue leaves. Great.\nOf course he would love this.\nThankfully, Radiant came to her aid. “Can you do something,” Radiant\nsaid to the armor, “about the hair and the satchel?”\nThe armor sent back consternation. It was … new. These spren had never\nbeen armor before, and had only vague impressions of how to proceed.\nRadiant was forced to send a distinct mental image, which made the gorget\nloosen, then the helmet vanished so Radiant could pull her hair out and let it\ndrape around her shoulders. The armor wasn’t as intelligent as Pattern, but\nit was eager to please—so with proper visualization, she got the armor to\nvanish and reappear in a way that left the satchel on the outside.\nUnfortunately, the strap immediately snapped. As she grabbed it, the\narmor seemed thoughtful. Then one section fuzzed again, making a kind of\nside holster out of metal that would hold the satchel.\nShallan! the armor said, voices of the pieces overlapping, sounding\nproud of itself.\nWell, that would do. If only Shallan would wear her hair in a utilitarian\nbraid. It took so long to prepare it in the morning. Perhaps Shallan would\nagree to cut it down to an inch long …\nThe immediate horror from Shallan made Radiant back away from the\nidea.\n“This is well,” Radiant said, looking to Adolin. “Though I will need\ntraining in its usage, I believe.”\n“Yeah,” Adolin said. “Um … Radiant?”\nShe nodded.\n“Don’t try to hold hands with anyone with that on. Or pick up anything.\nOr … well, just be careful.”\nShe dismissed the armor and fell an inch or so to the ground. Then she\nsummoned it again as practice, further ripping the coat—and making\nShallan cringe. Perhaps they could coach the spren on that. The helmet\nappeared and fit into place, leaving space at her neck for her hair to spill out\nthe back, which … didn’t seem the most intimidating image.\nThe helmet, though, was wonderful. It was strangely transparent from\nthe inside, giving her a full view. In addition, the glowing Lightweaver"

In addition, the glowing Lightweaver\nsymbol emblazoned on the front of the suit was nicely striking. The\ncreationspren were eager to know if they were doing this right, so Radiant\ngave a mental reassurance.\nInwardly Shallan snickered, imagining them summoning their armor in\nbattle and ending up with a pot on their head, a barrel around their middle,\nand various bathroom appliances stuck to their arms. So that was an image\nRadiant had to live with. That girl’s imagination. Honestly.\n“We must quickly transfer to Urithiru,” Radiant said, noting that the\nAzish guards were already running to deliver the news to their emperor.\nThe Oathgate here in Azimir was unique, as it was defended in a strange\nway. This had once been a market, and had a large dome covering it. Upon\nhearing that the Alethi had access to the Oathgates, the Azish had moved\nthe market and turned this into a strange kind of inward-facing fortification.\nRadiant supposed that if one of the Oathgates was going to get assaulted,\nthis might be the best target. That large dome was mostly of metal—\nhundreds of yards wide, with a high balcony ideal for stationing archers to\nshoot downward. Only … could they say this was the sole Oathgate being\napproached? Or were hidden invasion forces heading to other locations as\nwell?\nThe Azish made them vacate the control building first, despite her desire\nto go immediately. There was paperwork to fill out, of course, because this\nwas Azir. Nothing too egregious: a log of who was using the Oathgate and\nwhy. They’d need to wait for approval via spanreed.\nRadiant endured it. She probably could have bullied them into going\nfaster, but as long as the news of the impending army was in the emperor’s\nhands, the news was out. Likely the information would get to Dalinar and\nNavani via spanreed before she and Adolin could reach the king and queen.\nThough … Storms, how late was it? In Shadesmar, they’d lost track of\nthe physical world’s schedule. Talking to one of the guards, she discovered\nit was almost midnight, and the middle of the highstorm.\nAs she was thinking on this, someone entered the small tent at the edge\nof the dome, where they were waiting. Kaladin, with his blue uniform and\nshoulder-length hair with a faint curl to it. Shallan had always appreciated\nthat Kaladin didn’t cut it short, as this felt like him, but Radiant did wonder\nat his reasoning. Didn’t it give enemies something to grab on to?\nHey, Shallan thought at Radiant. I’m not shaving my head.\nIt would be so much more efficient, Radiant said. And you could just re-\ncreate the hair with an illusion …\nShallan took over and hurried through the tent, jumping up to give\nKaladin a hug. Storming Alethi giants. Syl entered a second later, and had\nfor some reason grown to the size of a human—as she appeared in\nShadesmar. Plus she was in some kind of uniform."

Plus she was in some kind of uniform.\nIn that case … well, Shallan let go of Kaladin—who as usual had\nsuffered the hug as if he were a log—and grabbed Syl in a hug too. There\nwasn’t much to hold. On this side, an honorspren was mostly incorporeal.\nShallan’s hands connected with something, but could pull in past the\nborders of Syl’s substance. It felt less like holding a physical being, and\nmore like the resistance you got when you pushed two magnets of the same\npolarity together.\nSyl laughed and tried to hug back.\n“Hey, Syl!” Adolin said as he stepped up and slapped Kaladin on the\nback. “Nice uniform.”\n“Thanks!” Syl said. “I made it myself! Out of myself!”\n“I like the cut of the hem,” Adolin said. “I haven’t seen many ko-\ntakamas around, except in old art.”\n“Stop gushing about clothing,” Shallan said, then looked to Kaladin. “Do\nyou have news? We have news.”\n“An army is gathering in Shadesmar,” Adolin said. “They’re mobilizing\nagainst Azimir.”\n“We need to scout the other Oathgates,” Shallan continued. “Can you fly\nus? After we talk to Dalinar.”\nKaladin smiled. “I’m sure some Windrunners can be assigned to that.\nI’m … not going into battle anymore. Your father has another duty for me.”\n“Another duty?” Adolin said. “It can wait! There will be a meeting. We\nhave to address this attack.”\n“I’m certain you will handle it well,” Kaladin said. He glanced at Syl,\nwho nodded. “We’re going to Shinovar with Szeth to scout out what’s\nhappening there, then hunt down Ishar the Herald.”\n“Kal,” Shallan said, “there might be battle coming. Bigger than any fight\nwe’ve seen before, judging by this mobilization. We need every soldier.\nSurely if we talk to Dalinar, he’ll cancel your forced leave.”\n“He’s already offered to do that,” Kaladin said. “But I think … I’m\nneeded more elsewhere. Or maybe Wit would say I need to be doing\nsomething else. It’s time for me to find another path, Shallan.”\nAdolin inspected him, thoughtful.\n“It’s all right,” Kaladin said, meeting her eyes, then Adolin’s. “I can’t\nexplain it, but this is the path I have to take.”\nStorms. “Is that optimism in your voice?” She wanted to make some\nwisecrack, but found the words wouldn’t flow. Not given the expression on\nKaladin’s face. Confident, yes. Optimistic as well.\nBut also … regretful? Solemn?\n“I think he’s always been optimistic,” Adolin said. “You don’t jump in to\nsave a doomed man unless you’re optimistic.”\n“Honor is dead …” Kaladin whispered.\n“You were wrong on that point though,” Adolin said. “Honor isn’t dead.”\n“But—” Kaladin started.\n“Honor isn’t dead,” Adolin continued, “so long as he—it—lives on in us."

We should have left already …”\n“Kal?” Shallan said, raising her chin. “What’s that tone in your voice?\nOut with it.”\n“Wit made it sound like … well, he made me think I should see the\npeople I care about before I leave.

The four of us.” He nodded to Syl. “Drinks, once this is\ndone.”\n“You two should go,” Kaladin said. “If you’re right about an army, then\nDalinar will want to meet immediately.”\nAdolin nodded, and as approval came, he gave Kaladin another slap on\nthe shoulder before leading Gallant back through the corridor toward the\nOathgate. Shallan lingered a moment, then poked Kaladin in the side. “I\nrefuse,” she told him, “to say goodbye.”\n“I’m … um, leaving anyway, Shallan.”\n“Leave, then,” she said. “But we started this. You and I. Radiants before\nanyone else.”\n“Except Jasnah. And maybe Lift. And perhaps—”\n“You and I,” she said, “were there at the start. We meet at the end, like\nAdolin said. When the world is safe, and Dalinar’s done what he needs to\ndo, we can all laugh and joke again.”\n“Shallan, you have to—”\n“Promise.”\nHe sighed. “I can’t promise what the future will be.”\n“Reality warps around you, Kaladin. It always has. Promise me. If\nthere’s a promise, then we can make it happen.”\nHe met her eyes, then nodded. “Drinks. Jokes. Laughter. At the end. I\npromise.”\nShe gave him one last nod, then she followed Adolin while Kaladin said\na quick goodbye to Drehy. After that, the Windrunner soared in with his\nsquires—and beat Shallan and Adolin to the control building at the center."

After that, the Windrunner soared in with his\nsquires—and beat Shallan and Adolin to the control building at the center.\nThere, Shallan summoned her Shardblade, and—\nAnd it was Testament.\nShe froze, feeling echoes of loss—but then reconciliation. She had faced\nthis. She could face this. From her coat, she heard a soft buzzing. Pattern,\nwith his characteristic hum. Two Shardblades.\n“Adolin?” Radiant asked, holding the ornate weapon. “Are there forms\nfor wielding two Shardblades at once?”\n“Of course there are,” he said. “They’re all practically useless though.”\n“Oh,” she said.\n“Sword and knife can be effective,” he said, “and I’ve seen arguments\nfor two side swords. Even that’s more showy, in my opinion, than effective.\nThere just isn’t much advantage to a second sword over a shield—or two-\nhanding one sword. Plus, when we get to the length and size of Shardblades\n… well, Radiant, I think we still have work left to get you fighting\neffectively with one.”\nShe nodded. But … what was that about sword and shield? She\ndetermined to give that some thought after this was done. For now,\nTestamentblade in hand, she stepped up and slid the weapon into the\nkeyhole in the wall of the small control building. With a nod from Drehy,\nwho had swapped for more Stormlight reserves, she rotated the inner wall\nof the circular chamber, activating the device. They appeared in a ring of\nlight on the cold …\nUm, surprisingly warm?\n… plateau outside Urithiru. Radiant frowned, stepping outside into\nhumid, toasty warm mountain air. Her ears didn’t pop as she swallowed, as\nusually happened when she came to Urithiru. Shallan was back in a\nheartbeat. What had happened to the pressure? The cold? It was night here\nin Urithiru—but the tower was glowing. Light shone from windows up and\ndown the structure—a pure, steady light. The wrong color. A shade too\ngreen to be Stormlight.\nOther lights lit the way—from the ground up—along the main plateau\ntoward the tower, where the grand entry shone like the Tranquiline Halls\nthemselves. Even the stonework seemed more … colorful. The city she’d\nleft had felt like the discarded shell of some animal. Now that animal had\nreturned, and Urithiru was alive once more.\nThe Windrunners streaked off into the sky, trailing Stormlight. They’d\nbring the news to the Bondsmiths and generals. Adolin walked up to her,\nleading Gallant. “There will undoubtedly be a meeting of the monarchs in a\nfew hours.”\n“In a few hours?” she said, surprised. “I thought it would be immediate.”\n“That is immediate,” Adolin said with a chuckle, “when you need to\nrouse everyone out of bed. We should have time for a quick change and a\nbite first, maybe even a nap.”\nShe nodded, falling into step with him and crossing the wide, circular\nplatform that made up the extended Oathgate. Preparing herself. The\nmonarchs and Bondsmiths would deal with the coming army. She needed to\ngather the Lightweavers she’d left here, and come up with a plan to deal"

That he would be tearing up at the idea of\nparting from a couple of lighteyes. One who’d rejected his advances, the\nother who was the king’s son. He watched them go, and found himself …\nRelieved?\nStorms, was this how his emotions worked when his brain wasn’t\nbetraying him?\n“What?” Syl asked.\n“I was just thinking about how I’d pined for Shallan, back before she\nwas married.”\n“Does it hurt, seeing them together?”\n“There’s some latent pain,” he admitted. “More about being rejected, as\nnobody likes being turned down. But storms … I’m actually happy it turned\nout this way.”\n“Because they love each other?” Syl asked.\n“Yeah. They’re my friends; I want them to be happy. But there’s more. I\ntry to imagine myself with Shallan, and I can’t help thinking our individual\nneuroses would feed off one another in dangerous ways. My sadness fueling\nher feelings of abandonment when I retreat. Her self-destruction triggering\nmy panic at being unable to help …”\nHe looked to Syl and smiled. “It wouldn’t have to go that way, of course.\nI’ve seen that it can help to be around people who understand firsthand\nwhat it’s like for your mind to betray you. Maybe we’d have worked it out.\nBut right now … I’m glad I didn’t have to try. I’m glad she has Adolin. He’s\nwhat she needs.”\n“And what do you need?” Syl asked softly.\n“Always looking out for me, are you?”\n“It’s basically my only job.”\nHe took a deep breath. “Well, I guess part of the reason for this trip is so\nthat we can find out.”\nThe Oathgate flashed. Shallan and Adolin left, joined by Drehy and his\nsquires.\nDalinar wants me in the line of succession, Kaladin thought idly. What\nwould that make me, Adolin, and Renarin? Brothers?\nStorms, from what he knew of lighteyed succession and genealogy …\nyes, they’d be brothers. Ever practical about such things, the Alethi made no\ndistinction between adopted heirs and birthed heirs—just as being\nconquered by or settling in the kingdom made you Alethi subjects,\nregardless of heritage.\nKaladin had spiraled toward death after losing his only sibling. Then\nhe’d found Bridge Four and the people of the warcamps. Now it seemed he\nhad more brothers and sisters than he could count.\nHe and Syl left the dome through a surprisingly long hallway—there was\na thick stone base to the dome, here near the ground—and met Szeth in the\nwaiting room at the side. Then he, Szeth, and Syl flew up high above the\nstorm. They’d skim the top of it here, where their Stormlight renewed\nconstantly but the winds weren’t too fierce to handle.\nKaladin absorbed the power of the storm, coming alight with Stormlight,\nand felt …\nSatisfaction."

I’ll never completely let go of Tien or Teft—but I am proud of how\nI’ve grown.”\n“You sound so final,” she said, hovering next to him. “All day you’ve\nhad this feeling to you … even before we talked to Wit.” She drifted closer.\n“Is it the Wind?”\n“Partially,” he said. “But Syl … I find I’m not worried. We are going to\nsurvive this. No matter what Wit said.” He nodded firmly. “We’re going to\nhave that drink with Adolin and Shallan.”\nHe held out his hand to her, and she—after a moment’s pause—took it.\nTogether, with Szeth following, they soared forward to the front of the\nstormwall, then joined with the winds, heading westward.\nTHE END OF\nDay One\nKalak locked himself into his secure building in Lasting Integrity. He\nchecked the locks three times, then sighed, closing his eyes. The Radiants\nwere gone.\nHe’d survived so, so many things, but this escape felt narrower than the\nothers. He couldn’t help thinking that the payment for his frighteningly long\nlife was coming due.\nEven after all this time, he didn’t want to die.\nHe put his back to the door, breathing hard. Should he have gone with\nthem? Eyes closed, he tried to remember the man he’d once been, the hero\nwho had fought for thousands of years. His life seemed a blur, a wash of\ngrey and brown, a fresh painting left out in the storm. These days he felt\nonly panic, indecision, and a crushing darkness. Always nearby, always\nthreatening him. Without Ishar holding some of it back … it would have\ndestroyed him long ago.\nBut he’d survived. He’d survived.\nWhat if the Ghostbloods sent others? Thaidakar wanted him. Thaidakar,\na Herald from another world, a creature who was resourceful and brutal.\nI need to hide somewhere else, Kalak thought. Yes. I will gather my\nthings and … and I will go. He rushed into his study, opening the door and\nstepping through.\nImmediately, the drapes from the window beside the door seized him,\nwrapping around him like two grasping hands, pulling him tight. They’d\nbeen cut into strange shapes. What was this? Some art of Stonewards? He\npanicked, but the cloth—moving on its own—filled his mouth. Like a\nconstrictor from the old world, it bound him, tied around him, then\nslammed him against the wall and held him there.\nHe whimpered.\n“Well hello, Herald,” said a man sitting at Kalak’s desk. “If you don’t\nmind, I have a few questions.”\nHe was a foreigner, with long mustaches and a short stature. Pale skin,\nhis hands laced before him. A floppy hat rested atop the desk. Kalak thought\nhe recognized the man. A member of the caravan? One of Prince Adolin’s\nsoldiers?\nOh … oh no …"

We won’t\nbe needing it, will we?”\nKalak whimpered again.\nThe stranger picked up the box that Shallan had relinquished to Kalak,\nthe one that held the seon. The creature liked to hide inside, timid and—\nThe stranger rapped on the box, and the ball of light popped out. “We\ngood, Felt?” it asked with a feminine voice.\n“Should be,” Felt replied.\n“Finally!” the spren said. “You have no idea how aggravating that\nexperience was.”\n“You did well,” Felt said, leaning back in Kalak’s chair. “I heard Shallan\nand Adolin talking, worried about the trauma you’d undergone by being ‘in\nprison.’”\n“Domi!” the spren replied. “If I had to listen to one more lovers’ spat\nbetween those two—let alone one more makeup session—I would grow a\nstomach so I could vomit.”\nThe ball of light swooped over to where Kalak was held against the wall.\nThe spren’s entire air had changed from a frightened and abused creature—\nwith dim light, and a symbol flickering at the center—to a glowing,\nconfident sphere.\nStorms … this was the thing they’d used to communicate. It knew\neverything they’d discussed. The real spy hadn’t been Shallan. He felt such\na fool. He, more than any, should have realized the potential for spren to\nturn against you. He struggled weakly in the strange bonds.\n“I was about to interrogate him, Ala,” Felt said.\n“There might not be a need,” Ala replied. “I’ve already relayed the\ninformation on Mishram’s location to Iyatil.”\n“And Lord Kelsier?” Felt said. “I don’t work for that masked witch.”\n“Him as well,” Ala said. “Obviously.” The spren hovered around Kalak’s\nhead. “Do we use the dagger?”\nFelt considered it, saw Kalak’s distress, and frowned. “No. I don’t trust it\n—Iyatil gave it to us, and Lord Kelsier said to be careful. I think we wait to\nmake sure the mission goes as planned. Mraize and Iyatil might contact us\nfor more explanations. So we sit tight, keep this one company, and bide our\ntime.”\n“I’m ready to be done with this world.”\n“It’s not so bad,” Felt said, idly playing with the dagger that could—if\nused correctly—end Kalak forever. “Once you get used to everyone being a\nfoot taller than you are. Be patient, Ala. Only a fool assumes they know\neverything, and Kalak might yet have a part to play.”\nKalak squeezed his eyes shut, trembling, his heart beating rapidly.

It seemed that one way or\nanother, further decisions were out of his hands.\nOdium knelt, holding a dying child.\nThis was Tu Bayla, considered a backwater by other nations—a place\nwhere foreign armies clashed, rather than ruining their own lands. Azir had\nfought Jah Keved—or Alethkar, when it held Jah Keved—here dozens of\ntimes over.\nFew thought of Tu Bayla; when mortal, Odium never had. Yet it had its\nown wonderful traditions. The people raised a strain of domesticated mink\nas hunting companions, and nearly everyone had one as a pet. They named\ntheir daughters after stars and their sons after flowers. They loved to sing,\nand had the greatest variety of instruments on all of Roshar, though few\noutsiders ever got to hear the beautiful music.\nNow they died. A famine had struck the land, initiated by the passing\nEverstorm destroying crops—exacerbated by the ending of trade between\nAzir and Jah Keved, who were now on opposite sides of the war. Most\nimportantly, in the chaos, the government had collapsed and warlords\nclaimed any supplies for themselves, using them as leverage to rule.\nSo many children died here, unseen. And Odium …\nThat was not my name, he thought. I cannot lose myself in godhood.\nOdium wept for them, and—having formed a body from his infinite\nessence—held one little boy close. Cultivation appeared behind him,\nwearing clothing that evoked the woods—green and vibrant brown, dark\nhair in tight curls.\n“I have infinite capacity,” Odium whispered, his voice ragged. “I can see\nto the ends of the cosmere. I can see the lives of people great and small. I\nhad thought this wonderful, with so much to experience, but now I find only\nsuffering. Infinite capacity to see. Infinite capacity to feel. Infinite capacity\nfor agony.”\n“Yes,” Cultivation said softly.\nOdium was a person divided. One side thinking, the other feeling. The\nformer understood that with his vast powers and knowledge, he would of\ncourse have to accept certain drawbacks or complications.\nThe latter just wanted to weep.\n“This is a curse,” he said, holding the dying child close. “I should be\nable to help them. Save them!”\n“You are forbidden,” Cultivation said, “from taking direct action against\nany who are not fully given to you.”\n“Because of the pact my predecessor made,” he spat. “I can break it.”\n“In so doing, you would be vulnerable to outside attack,” she said. “The\npowers bind us to our promises, particularly those made and sealed with a\nformal oath.” She crouched by him.\n“You promised to teach me what it is to be a god,” he whispered.\n“I am,” she said. “I know the pain, Odium, and why it must be. Tell me\nyou don’t. Tell me you can’t understand.”\nThe logical side of him asserted control, shoving down the side that\nsimply wanted to rage. “I understand,” he admitted. “Assuming these were\nfully mine, and I were allowed, it would not be enough. I could wave my\nhand, heal this boy’s body—but I’d return in several weeks and find him\nstarving again, because the systems that caused this suffering are still in"

I force them to share, to not hurt one another. I make pain\nimpossible.”\n“And in so doing …”\n“I create a country where there are no consequences. Is that so bad?”\n“You tell me,” she said in her infuriatingly calm way.\nYes, it would be bad. He could see all the permutations of time, as well\nas attempts by other Shards like himself to do this very thing. By directly\nintervening on such a granular level, he risked creating a society where no\none learned, and where civilization did not progress. By supernaturally\nforbidding warlords, he would also stifle scientists and artists. By removing\nthe capacity for violence, he would also remove the capacity for mercy.\nThe child died. He saw the soul briefly before it vanished to a place\nbeyond his touch.\n“What do we do instead?” Cultivation said.\n“You want me to say,” he whispered, “that we create systems—\nteachings, incentives—that encourage the right decisions. That we prevent\nwar by building up societies where people choose peace. We prevent greed\nby nurturing governments where the greedy are held accountable. We take\ntime, and we steer, but we do not dominate.”\n“Yes.”\nHe carefully rested the child’s body on the ground, then stood to face\nCultivation, who rose to meet him eye to eye. Anger made him tremble.\nThis divinity he held, it had so much emotion he could barely steer it.\n“I blame you,” he hissed.\n“For the boy’s death?” Cultivation said. “But I just showed you that—”\n“I blame you,” he said, “because you should have done better. Eight\nthousand years, and you should have fixed this. All three of you.”\n“You can see the circumstances that prevented that.”\n“Your fault still. I can do better.”\n“Odium … do not make this mistake.”\n“The problem,” he said, “is not these people. You shift the blame to them\nwith elementary theological arguments.”\n“Elementary,” she replied, “in the same way that gravity is elementary.\nBasic, because it is the foundation. People must be allowed choice.”\n“There is a spectrum of choice that can be allowed,” he said. “No society\ncan persist with complete freedom, and growth can happen within limits. I\ncan make it so that free will exists to an acceptable degree, while also\npreventing famines.”\n“You could do it now,” she said. “Calm the Everstorm. Make peace\nbetween nations. Restore trade.”\n“And in so doing, set them up for another war in a few years? Learn your\nown lessons, Cultivation. These people will not get along because they have\ndifferent forces manipulating them. Honor’s touch lingers, and your own\nmeddling—invisible to most—creates so much tension and strife. It is\nworse in the greater cosmere. So many gods who are cowards.”\n“Because we give people choice?”\n“Because you killed your father, and now worry the same will happen to\nyou.

He saw in them the depths of eternity, as he was sure\nshe saw in his—for these forms they wore were but cloaks across a vast\nessence that was itself infinite.\n“Not until what?” she demanded.\n“Not until there is but one god,” Odium whispered.\n“Do not go down this path. It destroyed your predecessor.”\n“I destroyed my predecessor,” he said. “Leave me. I am finished with\nyour ‘lessons.’”\nShe did, stalking away and vanishing—leaving him with the knowledge\nthat she would work against him. She had already been planning to do so,\npulling on threads for millennia to get what she wanted. She had raised him\nup because the old Odium was becoming too violent, too willing to destroy\neverything as the emotions raged freely. This had been her only choice to\nprevent a much greater cataclysm.\nThe divided one knelt, and let himself feel. He was not Odium. He held\nOdium. He would not let it rule.\nHe was not Odium.\nHe was Taravangian.\nAnd he had an important mission, the same that he’d given himself years\nago when he’d seen the threat to Kharbranth—then had moved to save it.\nHe was the one who could both see the coming danger and be willing to\nstop it.\nHe was Taravangian, the divided one—and he could save them.

He was\nnever truly alone these days, not with the Stormfather increasingly present\nin the back of his mind. Still, the sensation persisted. Dalinar. Alone.\nAgainst a god.\nHe had eight days to find a way to defeat Odium. When younger, Gavilar\nhad stood like this, surveying a battlefield, planning—while Dalinar had\njust blundered from fight to fight, stomping on toes and breaking down\nfences. How much better would all of this have gone if Dalinar had died in\nhis brother’s place that fateful night? Perhaps this war would already have\nbeen won.\nBut Gavilar was dead.

Wit adored plushness. He wanted a mattress\nthat would swallow a person, and had found hers to be unsuitably stiff.\nJasnah liked trying new things; this relationship itself was, in a way, such\nan experiment. She had enjoyed it for many reasons—the scheming\ntogether, the sharing of incredible plans, the chance to connect with\nsomeone so intellectually stimulating. Relationships were about\ncompromise, she had read, and so she’d procured a new bed.\nAnd she hated it. She swam in stuffing, irritationspren—like pink motes\nalmost invisible in the night—bobbing around her as she listened to Wit\nbreathing. He didn’t snore, but he did occasionally whistle.\nShe turned to the other side, which—since they both tended to sink\ntoward the center of this awful mattress—should have jostled him. He just\nlay on his back, whistling softly as he exhaled. Was he actually asleep?\nHe’d hinted that he visited other places at night. Other worlds. Engaging in\npolitical machinations at which she could still only guess.\nYes, there had been wonderful things about the relationship. So many\nothers, however, were like this bed.\n“You lie to me sometimes,” she whispered, facing him in the darkness.\n“You realize that means it can’t be a true relationship? I can trust someone\nwho has secrets, but not someone who lies.”\nIf he was aware, he didn’t say anything, though Design—on the wall\nbehind him—pulsed and rotated. So far Jasnah had caught him in only the\nmost minor of lies. He’d engage in wordplay with her, or toy with puns, and\nshe’d ask him to stop. He’d promise, and would appear to have followed\nthrough. But then she’d notice that the games hadn’t ceased, they’d merely\ngrown more subtle—Wit taking the wordplay to a more esoteric layer,\ndifficult to spot.\nHe seemed to think it would engage her, push her.

If only he’d be up-front with her …\nShe turned over again. A stiff pillow did little to counteract the strange\nstuffing, which was made of baby chicken feathers. Or perhaps the smallest\nfeathers of adult chickens? She hadn’t been able to parse Wit’s description,\nbut either way, a good lavis-husk mattress was far superior. Shredded, to\nremove the awkward lumps.\nShe had ordered another new mattress to put in the next room. She\nvalued the experiment of trying it his way, but she would not continue in\ndiscomfort simply to please him. A relationship required sacrifice by all\nparties, but it should not be built on a foundation of sacrifice. And …\nAnd storms. This was why it was best to avoid such entanglements.\nEight days until Dalinar confronted Odium, and she was worrying about a\nrelationship.\nPerhaps it was a way to distract her. Because despite all of her training,\nall of her learning, all of her preparation … the final decision was going to\ncome down to someone else. Dalinar would face Odium’s champion\nhimself.\nShe did not dispute his choice. He was a Bondsmith and a fierce warrior.\nHe’d had dealings with Odium, and perhaps understood the creature better\nthan any mortal. Jasnah had written out the reasons he was the best choice.\nYet … could it have been her? What if, instead of hiding her powers, she’d\ntold people what she could do and what she feared?\nHer life and Dalinar’s seemed very different. He’d burned a city, and\npeople forgave him. He’d proclaimed the Almighty to be dead, and half the\nardents had joined him. Yet when Jasnah was honest about her atheism, her\nthoughts on government, or her displeasure with traditions like the safehand\n… well, condemnation and judgment had chased her like twin headsmen,\neach looking to get a whipping in before the execution.\nWhen Jasnah Kholin spoke her mind, people hated her. Perhaps she’d\nlearned the wrong lessons from that, but could she be blamed?\nShe curled up, listening to the quiet sounds of Urithiru. Water moving\nthrough pipes of its own accord. Air whispering as it was pumped through\nvents. Trembling there, she at last realized why she hated this mattress so\nmuch. It reminded her of the soft restraints they’d given her when she’d\nbeen young.

She reached to the covered bowl\nof spheres beside the bed, but did not remove the black shroud or draw in\nStormlight—Light rising from her skin would make her a target in the\ndarkness.\nWit sat there, barely visible by the dim light that escaped the bowl\nthrough the shroud. He wore silken nightclothes, though his hair—as\nalways—was immaculate, despite his having slept on it. How?\n“What?” she hissed at him.\n“Oh, bollocks,” he whispered, and leaped from the bed, shockspren\nerupting all around, Design scurrying down the wall and across the floor\ntoward him. “The darkest, hairiest, greasiest bollocks on the most unkempt\nnethers of the most wanton demon of the most obscure religion’s damnable\nhellscape.”\n“Wit?” Jasnah said as he rushed to the counter. “Wit!”\nHe looked to her, wild eyed. Then he pulled the shroud off some spheres\nand washed the room in light. She blinked, dismissing her Blade. If Wit\nwasn’t worried about blinding them, then this wasn’t a physical danger. It\nmight just be another of his strange rants.\nExcept for the way he looked at her, eyes like glowing spheres. Lips\ndrawn, without even a hint of a smile. Jaw taut, hands clenched. Breathing\nquickly.\nGenuine panic. “Wit,” she said. “Please. What’s wrong?”\n“Give me a moment,” he mumbled, turning back to the counter covered\nin documents. “I need … I need a moment …” He extracted a notebook and\nbegan writing. She stood, and though the air was warm—thanks to her\nmother’s transformations—she felt cold in only her nightgown. She threw\non a robe, then leaned over Wit’s shoulder.\nThe symbols he wrote were unfamiliar—one of the many languages he\ncould speak from worlds beyond hers. It appeared that he was making a\ntable though. And those notations at the left of each row—the dots and lines\n—numbers? They repeated far more often than the other symbols did.\nHe wrote furiously, his handwriting growing sloppy. And he’d pulled out\nsome of the strange color-changing sand he used when experimenting. His\nexpression grew more intense.\nThe doors began to shake. Jasnah had a sword in hand a second later, but\nthen realized it was him. No one was on the other side. He was exerting\nsome kind of pressure that made the doors vibrate. The rings in her jewelry\nbox began to spill out onto the floor, while her shoes scooted away, pushed\nby their buckles. Every bit of metal in the room, save for her Shardblade,\nreacted to him—including her fabrial alarms, which went haywire, flashing\nrapidly.\nThen the sand burst alight with a mother-of-pearl iridescence and\nhovered above the table. Wit’s silky nightclothes began to writhe and\ncontort as if alive. His motions became increasingly frantic, fearspren\nbubbling up through the ground around them. Then in a flash—his body\nshape physically changing, molded like wax—he became another person.\nShorter, with stark white hair and subtly different features."

Then in a flash—his body\nshape physically changing, molded like wax—he became another person.\nShorter, with stark white hair and subtly different features.\nThis is the real him, she realized. A man not from their world who\nmasqueraded as Wit. But … his change had been physical, not an illusion.\nHe turned to her, pencil snapping under the pressure from his fingers.\n“I’ve been tricked,” he said.\n“H-how?” she asked.\nThe sand turned black and sprayed back down onto the counter. Wit’s\nshape reverted to his familiar self in seconds, and the room quieted—as if at\nan order from him—save for her fabrial alarms strobing the room white and\nred. He stood, again taller than she was, and held up what he’d written.\n“I’m missing,” Wit said, “three minutes and twenty-seven seconds.”\n“I’m not following,” she said. “Forgive me, Wit. I’m trying to parse this,\nbut … Storms, what is happening?”\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” he said, slumping into the seat beside her stone\ncounter—a natural feature of the room that jutted from the wall. “I have\nlived a very long time, Jasnah. Longer than a mortal mind can track, so I\nstore memories in something called Breath, an easily accessible—if costly\n—form of Investiture a person can adopt and, with training, use to expand\ntheir soul. I periodically review my memories, deciding what can be\njettisoned. In my review just now, I found something unexpected,\nsomething terrifying.”\n“Three minutes and twenty-seven seconds,” she whispered, interrogating\nthe notes on his page. As if by force of will she could decipher them.\n“Missing. When?”\n“A bit over a day ago,” he said.\n“And … what were you doing at the time?”\nHe let out a long breath, then met her eyes. “I was having a chat with\nOdium.”\n“A chat,” she said, her heart trembling, “with the most ancient enemy of\nhumankind? The being that seeks to destroy us, to crush my family, to\nweaponize all of Roshar for his own ends? A chat?”\n“We have a history,” Wit explained. “As I believe I’ve told you.”\nJasnah turned off her alarms, then pulled a chair over and sank down,\nfeeling sick to her stomach. “I asked you, Wit,” she whispered. “I asked you\nto involve me in any dealings you had with him.”\n“I’m telling you now, Jasnah,” he said. “That is, technically, involving\nyou.”\nShe held his eyes and knew. There would never be a place for her inside\nhis deepest self, would there? She’d always be on the outside, maintained as\npart of his collection. Enjoyed, perhaps even loved, but never confided in.\nShe had to withdraw, for her own sake. Anxietyspren, like twisting black\ncrosses, vanished as she tucked away feelings of betrayal. She had known\nwhat she was getting into with him. One did not court an immortal lightly.\n“What were you saying to Odium?” she asked.\n“I …” He shrugged. “I had to gloat a little.

Something happened in those lost minutes.\nHe got the better of me, then excised the memory from my mind, letting me\nbelieve I’d won the exchange. Now that I look, I can find the remnants. It\nwas hurriedly done.”\n“This is wrong, isn’t it?” she said.\n“Fantastically wrong. Rayse is a megalomaniac, Jasnah. For all his\ncraftiness, it would hurt him to let me walk away thinking I’d bested him.\nYet this time he encouraged it.” Wit leaned forward and took her hand.\n“He’s grown. After ten thousand years, Rayse has actually learned\nsomething. That terrifies me. Because if I can’t anticipate what he will do\n…”\n“Then what?”\n“We have to reread the agreement between him and Dalinar,” Wit said.\n“Now.”\nJasnah had a copy. After Dalinar and Odium had agreed upon the terms,\nthe Sibling had been able to quote for them the exact wording. They\nindicated that an agreement between gods wasn’t quite a contract, but it\ncould be written out as one.\nWit started to scan it.\n“Wit,” she said, feeling genuinely unnerved. “Odium said he would keep\nto the spirit of the agreement, not exploiting loopholes. You confirmed this\nwas indeed how it would work?”\n“So I thought,” Wit murmured, still reading. “I also thought I knew\nRayse. Everything is uncertain …”\nA pounding sounded at the entry to her rooms. She pressed her hand on\nthe wall and asked the Sibling to turn on the lights, then passed out of the\nbedroom, through the sitting room, to the door. She rapped out a pattern,\nand heard the proper knock in return, then eased open the door to reveal\nHendit of the Cobalt Guard. A man with discretion to match his general\npoise. She trusted him as much as she trusted any, so wasn’t bothered when\nhe saw Wit leave the bedroom.\n“What?” she said to Hendit.\n“Radiant Shallan and Highprince Adolin have returned, Your Majesty,”\nhe said in a low voice. “Armies are moving through Shadesmar toward\nAzimir, and they report the Oathgate will let them through. Your uncle has\ncalled for a meeting at first bell.”\n“I’ll be there,” she said, then closed the door and looked back across the\nsitting room toward Wit.\nAn invasion force closing on Azimir. She and Dalinar had both\nanticipated there would be attacks right up until the deadline, but they’d\nexpected border skirmishes. After all, what kind of major offensive could be\nmobilized and executed in just ten days?\n“I knew the loss of Cultivation’s Perpendicularity was going to bite us,”\nWit said. “We should have fought for it.”\n“We didn’t have the resources to hold the seas of Shadesmar,” Jasnah\nsaid. “We can defend against this assault.

He took a deep breath. “You’re … you’re right.\nWe need an expert, beyond even my considerable knowledge.”\n“Do you know any?”\n“On your world?” he asked. “Only one, but she and I aren’t on speaking\nterms. I will instead see if I can contact an old friend …”\nNavani was not asleep.\nShe climbed through the bowels of Urithiru, exploring an ancient tunnel\nthat—until her bonding of the Sibling—had been inaccessible. Lifespren\nbounced around her, small glowing green motes. Each one that arrived at\nthe tower, called by the sudden transformation, first found Navani and spun\naround her for a few hours before making its way to the fields.\nShe’d tried sleeping. It hadn’t worked, so she’d succumbed to her\nlonging to explore. This tunnel ultimately led to a large chamber with a wall\nof fabrials: hundreds of glowing gemstones in wire housings, emerging\nfrom the stone like rockbuds.\nShe’d been led here, as she could feel the workings of the tower. A\nthousand different fabrials pulsed in her mind, up and down the structure.\nAttractors drawing water to pumps deep below, delivering it to thousands of\ndifferent faucets across the enormous building. Heating fabrials to warm the\nair. And these on the wall … they drew in air and pushed it through\nUrithiru, ventilating the entire city. How much could she learn from this?\nWhat marvels could she build with such knowledge?\nShe closed her eyes, sensing the fabrials in the wall more acutely now\nthat she was near. Their air was like the breath in her lungs, the water the\npulse of her veins. Anytime she paused, she felt it—and a host of other\ninteractions. Lights glowing from within stone. The lifts in near-constant\nmotion. The powerful strength of Towerlight, infusing all Radiants who\nentered.\nWith that, she hoped her home—now an extension of her very self—\nwould be safe from any further attacks by the enemy.\nIt should be, the Sibling said in her mind. They rarely dared infiltrate me\nbefore. My Light not only knocks Fused unconscious, it makes the Radiants\nhere virtually invincible.\nWe need to learn how to send that Light with them, Navani thought back,\ntrailing through the room, resting her fingers on each fabrial she could\nreach. Spren of a half dozen varieties followed like a cloak made of light.\nIt cannot be done, the Sibling said. Humans cannot hold my Light; they\nare too full of holes.\nIn talking to Dalinar earlier, she’d learned that a Radiant leaving would\nlose Towerlight almost immediately. If a person carried it in a gemstone, the\nLight escaped faster than Stormlight did. Towerlight was a gift, but solely in\nUrithiru.\nBut while they were here, it was omnipresent.

The spren singing to\nthe Sibling.\nShe found such incredible awareness impossible to ignore. So no, she\ndidn’t sleep. She hadn’t in two days, and didn’t feel tired or draw a single\nexhaustionspren.\nWould you like me to quiet the noise? the Sibling asked.\nPerhaps, Navani replied. I will need sleep eventually.\nNo, the Sibling said. You’re part of me, and I am part of you. The tower\ndoesn’t need sleep. You will not either.\nNo sleep …\nShe should have asked, but there was so much to learn. She’d discovered\nonly yesterday that she couldn’t leave the tower for any extended period of\ntime, or it would weaken the bond. A few weeks at most was all she could\nrisk.\nShe tried not to feel inhibited by that. She had great gifts, and the trade-\noff was a reasonable one. Plus, how much could she get done with the extra\nhours not spent asleep? She opened her eyes and tipped her head back,\nlooking up some thirty feet at the wall dappled with gemstones and filigree.\nIt was all so wonderfully overwhelming. Not just the bond to the tower, but\nher emotional journey. Acknowledging her self-worth. Becoming a Radiant,\nwhen she’d been certain it would not be her lot.\nA solitary keenspren, like a marvelous three-dimensional gradient of\ncolor, appeared above her. She gasped—it was the first she’d ever seen.\nThey are afraid, the Sibling said. Of being captured. So they do not often\ncome to humans.\nOne thing still divided Navani and the Sibling, who disapproved of\nmodern fabrials. The spren worried Navani would take what she learned\nand create more abominations. Modern fabrials required trapping spren\nagainst their wishes. The archaic versions, like the ones that ran the tower,\nused willing spren—but were inefficient in so many ways …\nAnd storms. There was so much to learn. So much to do. She barely\nknew where to start. Perhaps she could discuss it with Dalinar? Hopefully\nhe was asleep by now.\nHe’s opening the door to your rooms, the Sibling said. Would you like to\nlisten to what he’s saying?\nWe need to talk about you spying on everyone in the tower, Navani\nreplied.\nWhy?\nIt’s not right. People need privacy.\nThey’re inside me, Navani. They can’t expect privacy when they crawl\ninside someone. I don’t hear it all anyway. Only what I pay attention to.\nStill, Navani replied, it seems—\nNavani. NAVANI.\nShe froze in place, hand on a fabrial, lifespren swirling around her as\nthey sensed her mood.

Here, they’d come to the royal yacht\nbecause he longed for the “sound of the deck creaking to serenade the\nswaying beat of waves on the hull.” They sometimes came down to the\nship, even docked as it was, for a few nights. A getaway that didn’t involve\nmuch getting away, as she had business to be about.\nBut they weren’t in the yacht’s royal suite. They were belowdecks, in the\nmidshipmen’s quarters, stuffed into a hammock. She didn’t complain; she\nwas the one who had married a sailor. Plus, this was cozy and warm. But\nstill.\n“Aren’t we,” she said, swaying in the dark room, “a little old for this,\ngemheart?”\n“I’ll take it up with the council, love,” he replied, his whiskers sharp on\nher skin. “The queen would like advice from her most brilliant of advisors:\nIs she too old for quality time with her husband? Perhaps she is too\ndistinguished for an occasional tumble in the surf?”\n“I wasn’t talking about that,” she replied. “Just the part where we snuck\naway from the guards and found a hammock. You’re almost seventy, you\nknow.”\n“Which makes you …”\n“Almost seventy.”\n“Pretty young,” he said, “by some accountings.”\n“By what kind of accounting is seventy young?”\n“Almost seventy.”\n“And?”\n“And the average age of your merchant council must be somewhere in\nthe eighties,” Kmakl replied. “So by that comparison, we’re basically a new\nschooner. Now stop distracting me from distracting you.”\nShe sighed, but relaxed into the swaying hammock, the rough canvas\nrubbing her bare skin. Waves rocked the ship, and her cares fled before\nwarm perfection. Until a brilliant white light lit the cabin. Damnation.\nShe sat up, as did Kmakl on the other side of the hammock. Both of\nthem glared at the young lieutenant standing on the ladder up, holding a\ndiamond sphere lantern. His eyes locked on Fen—bare in the hammock—\nand he dropped the lantern in shock. It broke open, spilling diamonds in a\ncascade of glittering light.\n“Bother,” Kmakl said. “I thought they knew not to look for us. I\nspecifically left hints …”\n“Sorry, sorry, sorry,” the lieutenant said, scrambling down the ladder,\nshamespren all around as he started snatching up the diamonds. “Sorry! I\ndidn’t see! I mean, I’m sorry I saw, Your Majesty! Ah!”\n“It’s fine,” she said, leaning back. “You know, the queens of history were\nsometimes painted with one breast bare?”\n“Never did understand that,” Kmakl said.\n“Some nonsense about suckling a nation,” Fen replied. “As if these old\nthings would offer more than sawdust.”\nThe lieutenant continued to scramble for diamonds—though if he’d had\nhalf a brain, he would have simply left.\n“It truly is our fault for sneaking off,” Kmakl said. “Can’t believe you let\nme talk you into it, Fen.

Served him right. Though they pretended to be sneaky, the\nentire ship knew to turn a blind eye, letting them imagine they were being\nscandalous.\n“Oh, let the lad off, Fen,” Kmakl said.\n“Get on with you, boy,” Fen said. “We’ll deal with the spilled spheres.\nYou pretend you weren’t here, and so will we. Out. Shoo.”\nThe youth stood up, his white eyebrows stiffened in the naval fashion.\nHe squeezed his eyes closed and saluted. “Your Majesty! Prince Consort!\nI’ve been sent to locate you! News from Urithiru: enemy armies are poised\nto invade Azir!”\n“What?” Fen said, coming alert. She reached for her clothing on the\nfloor, nearly dumping the two of them out on their bare backsides. “Why\ndidn’t you say something!”\n“Sorry. Sorry sorry sorry!” He saluted again, eyes still closed.\n“I thought they already invaded Azir,” Kmakl said.\n“That was Emul,” she replied. “It’s impossible they’d reach Azir by the\ndeadline; we have the bulk of our armies in the way.”\n“They’re coming through Shadesmar!” the lieutenant said.\n“Does the Thaylen Council know, lad?” Kmakl asked.\n“They’re being roused. I—” He cut off and stumbled back as someone\nelse slid down the ladder.\nIt was a storming admiral. Fladrn to be precise—a man with grey hair\nlike stormclouds and spiked eyebrows. He took in her state of undress and\ndidn’t miss a beat. “Your Majesty, this is urgent.”\n“This news about Shadesmar is that bad?” Fen said, dressing rapidly. If\nFladrn had come in person …\n“No, not that,” Fladrn said. “This is something new.”\nFen froze. A pit forming in the depths of her stomach, anticipationspren\nrising through the floorboards in the shape of streamers. Perhaps it was a\nlifetime of always expecting the worst, but she somehow knew what he was\ngoing to say.\n“A second offensive,” she guessed.\n“Yes, Your Majesty,” he said. “Our blockade of Jah Keved has been\nbreached. We just got word.”\n“The Veden blockade?” Kmakl said. “We were supposed to have that\nwell secured, barring …”\n“Barring heavy air support,” Fen said, closing her eyes. “Heavenly\nOnes?”\n“No, Your Majesty,” the admiral said. “Skybreakers.

Because the schedule said he was to be asleep,\nand he kept to the schedule. It was basically the sole thing required of him.\nFollow the outline, provide a model of stability for an empire.\nThe emperor did not lie awake, staring at his ceiling. The emperor\nunderstood that by sheer force of will he could bring peace and harmony to\nhis people. So by force of will, the emperor could obviously make himself\nfall asleep. So he was sleeping. Right then. He had to be.\nTherefore, all the thoughts that crowded his mind—well, they were the\nthoughts of a man dreaming.\nHe did not toss or turn. That would be interpreted as nervousness by the\nten blessed citizens who had been granted the privilege of maintaining his\nbedside vigil. A great honor, tonight bestowed upon women who had\nworked diligently to feed their armies fighting near Emul. It happened all\nnight, every night. Every hour, ten new people would come bask in the\nimperial presence.\nNot Yanagawn’s presence. It wasn’t a man who blessed this nation, but\nthe office itself. Yanagawn was basically like the rack that held up his\nclothing, kept to his shape so those passing outside could see it and be\ninspired.\nHow he wished he could do more than stand and be seen.\nIt was good he was asleep, because those thoughts were unseemly.\nYanagawn was specifically not a man like Dalinar Kholin, who made\ndecisions, then acted. A man who had charged into battle with Plate and\nBlade, forging a nation. That kind of man was dangerous.\nExcept, while dreaming, Yanagawn wished he were dangerous.\nOn paper, he owned every Shard in the greater empire. In reality, many\nwere owned by other kingdoms—and though they paid lip service to the\nimperial seat of Azir, they would never consider delivering up their\nartifacts. He’d be a fool to expose imperial impotence by making such a\ndemand.\nAzir also owned Shards, carried by distinguished soldiers with an\nimperial grant of rights—they could offer aid to the great merchants and\nhouses of Azir in exchange for money, much of which went to the crown.\nMost of their work was civil: cutting new trenches and the like. Those who\nwielded them were loyal, and it was a respected position. Demanding they\nreturn their Shards would be a great dishonor to them.

He rose, planning to\narrive early for the meeting so he could get updates on current troop\nplacements. Unfortunately, something interrupted his plans. It was called a\nshower.\nWater rained down through holes in the ceiling of a small room beside\nhis bedroom. A light behind the stones indicated the level of heat, and if he\npressed his hand to it and rotated, he could make the water warmer or\ncolder. A similar dial let him control the pressure and flow.\nHe was a highprince. A Shardbearer. And this was the single greatest\nmoment of luxury he’d ever known.

She turned it down—changing the flow from a beating frenzy\nto a soft sprinkle.\n“Aaaahh …” she said. “But not hot enough.”\n“Are you trying to drive me out?” Adolin asked as she turned the heat up\nto uncomfortable levels.\n“It’s like rain,” she said, her head tipped back so the water could wash\nacross her face, “if rain were warm.”\n“Hot.”\n“Heat is life. It reminds me that I’m alive.”\n“You … forget that?”\n“Once in a while,” she whispered, then leaned on him, wet hair against\nhis chest. “You’re warm too.”\n“Hakindar brought me six different soaps,” Adolin said. “And a rough\nsand mix from Marat to exfoliate! There’s this one soap out of Thaylenah—\nthey use it on their eyebrows—that is fantastic for hair.”\nShe nodded absently, her eyes closed. So he held her, skin against skin,\nslick and warm. This was perfection. This was what he’d always wanted,\nand had never been able to find, until he met her. Not merely skin to skin.\nSoul to soul. He ran his fingers through her wet hair, massaging her scalp,\nher cheek against his chest.\n“I love you,” he whispered. She grinned back, and he picked her up off\nthe ground a little, surrounded by joyspren, holding her tight.\n“I still …” Shallan whispered. “I still need to deal with the Ghostbloods.\nI might have to miss Dalinar’s meeting. Will you … will you tell him and\nNavani … about Mraize, and what I’ve done? I’m not sure I can spare the\ntime.”\n“Of course,” Adolin said, impressed by how willing she was to be open\nabout these issues. And if she didn’t want to—perhaps couldn’t—explain to\nDalinar herself right now, he understood. “I don’t blame you for wanting\nsomeone to prep my father for you. He can be … stern to those who\ndisappoint him.”\nShe perhaps sensed the bitterness in his tone, noticed how several\njoyspren winked away. It had been a year since Adolin had learned Dalinar\nkilled his mother, and he couldn’t let go. As he set Shallan down, she took\nhis face in her hands.\n“Would it help to talk?” she asked.\n“I don’t know, Shallan,” he said. “Honestly, I don’t want to think about\nhim. Or talk to him. I don’t want to fix things between us. I just … I …”\nHe’d thought waiting would let the pain fade. It had instead festered. He"

He\nfound himself more angry than he’d been when he’d first found out.\n“Another time,” he told Shallan. “I promise. You’re really going to miss\nthe meeting? Did you hear about Thaylen City? A second attack. Maybe\nmore. We’ll know once the scout reports come in.”\n“You can handle it,” she said. “Mraize is here in the tower somewhere,\nand will move against me soon. So I have to move first. It will help if you’ll\ntalk to the Bondsmiths, maybe get me authorization for Radiant troops and\na preemptive strike, if I can find the current Ghostblood nest.”\nHe sighed, wrapping his arms around her again. “Is this ever going to\nend? We met not long before the Everstorm, and married in the middle of a\nwar. I’ve had enough of wearing uniforms every day. Watching cities fall.\nFeeling that I need to hold on tight every time I have you in my arms, as I\ndon’t know when the next chance will be.”\n“I know,” she whispered, head to his chest once more. “I want to kiss\nyou until you can’t breathe and spend a week never leaving our rooms. But\nwe can’t. Not yet. Mraize will try to hurt me, love. Prove that I was foolish\nto cross him. To get to me, he’ll capture or kill you if he can. I have to act\nbefore he does.”\nHe met her eyes, as best he could with both of them blinking away water.\nShe reached up to push a cascade of soaked red hair out of her face. It might\nnot have been the best place for a meaningful stare, but neither of them\nmoved, and the joyspren were soon joined by passionspren—like\nsnowflakes, but more crystalline.\n“Thank you,” he said.\n“For understanding?”\n“For trusting me to understand,” he said. “I’ve never begrudged you\nyour secrets, Shallan, but now that you’re sharing them, I find them\nprecious.”\nShe cocked her head. “I … have shared them, haven’t I? You know it all.\nAll about Mraize, the Ghostbloods, Formless …” She gripped his arms\ntight, pressing her entire self against him, and grinned, water dripping from\nher nose. “You know it all and you don’t hate me! Right?”\n“Of course I don’t.”\n“It’s almost kind of all right,” she said. “It can maybe, possibly work out\n… if I stop Mraize. I don’t know why he wants to find the prison of the\nmost powerful Unmade, but …”\nAdolin nodded. “I’ll represent you at the meeting.”\nShe moved to slip away, without even conditioning her hair. He pulled\nher back. Not for the hair though.\n“Surely we have a few minutes,” he said, “before running to the next\ncrisis? I mean, haven’t you always wondered what it would be like, out in\nthe rain …?”\nShe paused, holding his hand. “Drat,” she said.\n“What?”\n“I was trying very hard to stay focused, Adolin Kholin,” she said, “and"

The heat he’d been fighting off rose\nwithin him, outdoing that of the stream from above, and the passionspren\nfell more powerfully. It seemed that whether or not she had time to spare,\nthey were going to find it.\nDalinar stomped through the corridors of Urithiru, throwing on his coat. He\nwas joined by Colot, second-in-command of the Cobalt Guard. The tall\nlighteyed man had little tufts of red hair mixed through his black, dark\nenough that they were visible only in direct light.\nDalinar didn’t need guards these days, but he said nothing as the man\nfollowed. Colot had been bouncing between positions for a few years, and\nthe last thing he needed was to feel useless or rejected. Again. Kelen, the\nWindrunner squire who had come to fetch Dalinar, hovered along beside the\ntwo of them. It had been merely three days since Navani had reenergized\nthe tower, and the Windrunners already appeared perfectly comfortable\nflying all the time.\nEven at this time of night, Urithiru was usually active—but today the\nmain thoroughfare was less congested than normal. The invasion and the\ncurfews had a lingering effect. People were still traumatized, hiding in their\nrooms, recovering from the stress. Dalinar stormed forward, keeping\nmomentum, as had always been his way. People who spotted him would\nyelp and jump back, but mostly he ignored everyone.\nAs they neared the atrium, where they’d be able to travel to the meeting\nchambers at the top of the tower, Windrunner Sigzil came streaking through\nthe corridor and landed nearby. “I have the initial scout reports, sir.”\n“And?”\n“And you were right, sir,” Sigzil said, holding up a stack of papers as\nthey walked. “It’s not just Azimir and Thaylen City—there’s a third\noffensive. A large number of Fused are marching on the Shattered Plains.”\nDamnation. Two was bad enough—particularly when one was Thaylen\nCity, which had barely recovered from the Battle of Thaylen Field a year\nago. It didn’t have much of a defensive force remaining, and what few ships\nthe royal navy maintained had been dedicated to the Veden blockade. He’d\nneed to send Fen support. A great deal of it.\n“What do we know about the Fused?” Dalinar asked.\n“We sent two Windrunners,” Sigzil said, “who were stationed at a scout\npost in the Frostlands. Sir, they estimate almost a thousand Fused, and at\nleast one thunderclast is with them, if not both.”\n“Storms,” Dalinar said. A thousand Fused? He’d never faced a battle\nwith more than two hundred. There weren’t that many Radiants in all"

        "text": "least one thunderclast is with them, if not both.”\n“Storms,” Dalinar said. A thousand Fused? He’d never faced a battle\nwith more than two hundred. There weren’t that many Radiants in all\nRoshar—not by half. “Why the Shattered Plains? Did they get wind of\nJasnah’s plan to found a second Alethi kingdom there?”\nThe Windrunners didn’t have answers for him, though it did make sense\nto send Fused. Odium couldn’t get many troops to the Shattered Plains\nbefore the deadline—so he’d have to rely on quality rather than quantity.\nPlus, Fused moved far faster than conventional troops, especially if they\nhad Heavenly Ones to fly them part of the distance.\n“A three-way assault,” Kelen said, hovering to his left. “Striking at our\nthree most powerful strongholds other than Urithiru.”\n“Assuming,” Sigzil said, “they aren’t planning to strike here as well.”\n“The Sibling is confident,” Dalinar said, “that no Fused would dare set\nfoot here now, and that Regal powers won’t work. They’d have to use\nconventional troops, which would be massacred by our Radiants.”\nBut this did seem to be a message. Strikes on Dalinar’s coalition: Azimir,\nThaylen City, and the Shattered Plains, which was becoming Alethkar in\nexile. Once the contest arrived in eight days, the borders would freeze—and\nwhile the enemy could probably capture more land by pushing at the\nborders, this was more intimidating. It warned that Odium could cut out the\nvery hearts of his enemies if he wanted.\nWell, let him try. They reached the atrium and stepped out onto a\nbalcony overlooking the central hub below. A large window ran up the\nlength of the far wall, stretching a hundred stories into the sky, showing\ndarkness outside.\n“Just in case,” Dalinar said, “wake every soldier. Send patrols to scan the\nnearby mountains and into Shadesmar here. Post quadruple guard forces at\nany possible incursion point into Urithiru—including the Oathgates and the\ncaverns. Any news on the other monarchs?”\n“They’re confirmed for your meeting, sir,” Sigzil said, holding up the\npapers. “Teshav asked me to deliver these. Letters from Azir and Thaylenah\n—both sound quite alarmed, but agree that meeting is wise.”\nDalinar had given him authority, as leader of the Windrunners, to read\nletters like this. It was wonderful to have another man around who didn’t\nfeel embarrassed to be seen reading. In the past, Sigzil had always been coy\nabout his training in Azir, and whether it included the ability to read Alethi\nscripts. In the face of Dalinar’s decisions, his need for subterfuge had\nevaporated.\n“Has anyone seen Wit?” Dalinar asked.\n“There,” Sigzil said, pointing toward one of the lifts already rising to the\nupper floors. “I spotted him and the queen on their way.”\n“Good,” Dalinar said, holding out his hand. “If you’ll give me a Lashing,\nI might beat them there. Then …” He trailed off as he noticed someone\napproaching down the hallway. The nursemaid, carrying little Gavinor,"

The nursemaid, carrying little Gavinor,\ndressed in his schoolchild’s outfit of knee-length trousers and a blouse.\n“Mararin?” Dalinar said to her. “Is something wrong?”\n“I’m taking him up to the garden room,” Mararin said. “It comforts him,\nBrightlord. I apologize; I didn’t expect to encounter you.”\n“It’s the middle of the night.”\nGav buried his face in her havah, but peeked at Dalinar. The boy’s eyes\nwere red from tears.\n“Nightmares?” Dalinar asked Mararin.\nShe nodded. The woman could be stern, but she cared deeply for the\nchildren she watched over.\n“Grampa?” Gav whispered, yawning. “You promised to play swords\nwith me.”\n“You need sleep, Gav,” Dalinar said softly, stepping toward him. “And\nGrampa has important work today. We will play tomorrow.”\nGavinor nodded, rubbing his eyes on Mararin’s dress.\n“Get him something to eat,” Dalinar said. “Then bring him up to the\ntower top. Maybe after my meeting I can—”\n“Dalinar Kholin?” a voice asked.\nHe spun, but found that Colot the guardsman had already stepped\nbetween him and the speaker. She was a shorter woman, Makabaki, in\nbrown clothing. Black hair in tight curls, heavyset build. Dark brown eyes\nthat shimmered with something he couldn’t define.\n“Do I know you?” Dalinar asked.\n“We’ve met,” she said, then turned and walked along the balcony railing.\nShe waved for him to follow.\n“You give orders to the king of Urithiru?” Colot said. “What manner of\n—”\n“Stay back,” Dalinar said, waving to them all. Then he ran to catch up to\nthe woman. Her air, attitude, and looks dredged up deep memories. Ones\nhe’d once forgotten by her own hand.\nNo. It couldn’t be. Could it?\nCultivation. The third god.\nThey had left behind family and hereditary home, something many\nwould find unconscionable.\n—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable\nShallan lay on her back on the floor underneath the shower, letting the\nwater wash over her. She’d turned it down to a sprinkle, like the riddens of\na storm, to rain on her bare skin and tap on the stones around her. The air\nwas humid from the steam, so she breathed it in thick.\nShe could have lain there forever, enjoying a satisfaction and a fullness\nshe could never have captured in a painting. This fragment of time was\nabout the sensation more than the description. The knowledge that she’d\nopened herself to Adolin, and he had accepted her: flaws, issues, and\ndreams alike.\nWater, stone, and steam …\n… the contentment of knowing that all was—briefly—right …\n… lazy joyspren, swirling around her like blue leaves …\nThis was her reward.

A dozen of them all in a cluster, glowing\nfaintly silver, bouncing up and down.\n“Shallan! Shallan! Shallan!”\n“You guys were … watching?” she asked the creationspren.\n“Shallan! Shallan! Shallan!”\nWell, nice to have a cheering section, she supposed. She looked up and\nfound Pattern dimpling the stone of the wall.\n“Don’t say it,” she told him, climbing to her feet.\n“What?” he said. “It’s absolutely allowed, even encouraged now.”\nShe smiled and finished rinsing, then turned off the water, whispering a\nlittle thank-you to the tower as she toweled off. She then searched the wall\nby Pattern for any sign of Testament.\nNothing. They might still be bonded, but it wasn’t enough to pull\nTestament through. Shallan’s good mood faded as she imagined her poor\nspren sitting alone on the other side. I’ll fix it, she thought. I’ll find a way.\nFirst she had work to do. She put on one of Veil’s outfits and crossed the\nmain sitting room. She and Adolin had a prime location with a large\nbalcony adorned with planters, which she stepped out onto, Pattern having\ntaken his customary place on her long white coat.\n“Well?” she asked.\nOne of the planters stood up, Stormlight steaming off as the\nLightweaving vanished, revealing a short, bearded man. Gaz no longer\nwore an eye patch—he’d healed from that wound. But he often rubbed at\nhis eye.\n“Got a crook in my neck,” Gaz grumbled, stretching. “But I didn’t spot\nanything odd. Red, what about you?”\nAnother planter stood up, a lanky man in bright red suspenders\nemerging. “Nothing. If they’re going to strike, they’re smart enough not to\nbe obvious.”\nShallan leaned back against the wall and folded her arms. She nodded to\nRed, who took out a spanreed and clicked it on and off. They didn’t bother\nwriting things out, instead using the flashing ruby—intended for indicating\none was done writing—as the actual communication. Windrunners had\nstarted developing a code for that.\nThe door to her rooms opened, and two more of her team entered from\nthe hallway outside, where they’d been hidden. Stargyle—a tall, handsome\nman with a ready grin—shook his head. Darcira followed, one of the newer\nmembers of the Unseen Court. No one had so much as scouted Shallan’s\nrooms, best any of them could tell. The five of them gathered around her\nfront room table.\n“Wit sends word,” Gaz said, pulling over a chair. She could see his\nCryptic riding on his shoulder. All of her agents were full Lightweavers,\nhaving spoken the First Ideal and at least one truth. None of those here were\nShardbearers yet, but Gaz and Red were close. “Your brothers are safe, but\nWit wouldn’t even tell me where he took them.”\n“We can trust Wit,” Shallan said."

He did give us these.”\n“No Lightweaver has to join us,” Red said. “In fact, we’re basically full,\nain’t we, Veil?”\nShallan nodded, not wanting to explain the nuance regarding Veil at the\nmoment. Regardless, Red was right. There would be other Lightweavers,\nbut they could form their own family. This group—the Unseen Court—was\nhers, and she wasn’t going to let it grow unwieldy. Kaladin barely knew the\nnames of half the Windrunners these days.\nThere were twelve pictures, sketches of the Ghostbloods that Wit had\nidentified. Most of these faces were familiar, but a few were new. Shallan\nexamined two in particular, a woman and a man who wore hoods and\nmasks. Shorter people, with a foreign look to their clothing. Iyatil, master of\nthis cell of Ghostbloods, was an offworlder who always wore a strange\nwooden mask. Neither of these depictions were of her.\nA note at the bottom said, Looks like Iyatil has called in offworlder\nreinforcements. Watch them. They’re dangerous.\n“I scouted the tower earlier, as you said,” Stargyle told her. “I spotted\nthese two in the atrium, but they also caught me watching them. Neither of\nus moved against one another, and I sensed tension in the way they\nretreated. It’s like … we’re all waiting for the spark that will light the fire.”\nHer eyes lingered on the picture of Mraize, wearing a refined suit, his\nface ripped by old scars. He had been her teacher. A brutal, manipulative\none—but he had seen things in her she hadn’t recognized in herself. He’d\npushed her, yes, but also encouraged her. Now they were at last truly\nenemies. She’d known it was coming, and she hated some of what he\nrepresented, like locking Lift in a cage, as she’d heard from Red.\nShallan had chosen her side, but it troubled her that—as seemed\ninevitable—she was again opposed to her mentor. Her mother, her father,\nTestament, Tyn, now Mraize. How many people who had cared for her\nwould she have to kill? She let Radiant take over, removing her hat and\nbleeding her hair to yellow so the others would recognize the\ntransformation.\n“So far as we know,” Radiant said, “I have the secret they needed from\nKelek—while they do not. They’ll try to extract that information from me.\nThis exposes us to danger, but exposes them as well—because we know\ntheir next move.”\n“Attacking us,” Gaz said. “Or your family.”\n“You are my family, Gaz,” Radiant said. She narrowed her eyes at the\nsheets. “Fortunately, Shallan has a plan. We’re going to form a strike team.”\n“A strike team to do what?” Gaz asked. “Radiant, I’m not afraid to fight,\nbut they have resources from another storming planet and they’re led by"

I don’t know how we fight them.”\nShallan bled back in for a moment and met Gaz’s stare. “Like I said,\nGaz, we have the advantage. They need Mishram’s prison for some reason,\nbut we know where it can be found. If we reach it before they do, we can\nuse it as a bargaining chip to secure our safety.”\n“There’s more,” Red said. “We’re Radiants. We have something they\nnever will: we’ve spoken truth to ourselves.”\nGaz rubbed his chin, then nodded. “You mentioned armor earlier. Is it\ntrue? You have the next Ideal?”\n“Yes,” she said, and made armor form around her, lifting her half an inch\ninto the air as the boots encased her feet.\n“Neat,” Red said. “You have armor, so now we all have armor.”\n“That’s not how it works, Red,” Darcira said, wagging a sketch pencil at\nhim. “We don’t get her powers. Storms, you’re not even her squire anymore\n—you have your own spren!”\n“Yeah, but you heard what Stormblessed did,” Red said, standing up and\nholding out his arms. “He can share his armor! Make it swoop in and\nprotect people! I’ve always wanted Plate. Can I borrow it, Shallan?”\nShe hesitated. She’d … only just earned it.\nDarcira tapped her sketchpad. “It would be good to know if that works,\nBrightness.”\nA reasonable point. Storming former ardent and her scientific mind.\n“Fine,” Shallan said. “How do I do it?”\n“It seems like it just kind of worked for Kaladin,” Red said.\n“Everyone’s talking about it,” Darcira said. “Kaladin flew around. You\nknow, like they do. And his armor—made of windspren—swept here and\nthere, enveloping other soldiers when needed.”\n“Storming lordship bridgeman,” Gaz muttered, “and his storming\nheroism.”\nThey glanced at him.\n“He does it just to make me feel bad,” Gaz said.\n“He acts like a hero,” Red said, amused, “because it annoys you.\nReally.”\n“Yup,” Gaz said. “Everyone should be grateful to me. If I hadn’t shown\nthose bridgemen tough love, they would never have grown up to be such\nnauseating paragons of self-righteousness.”\n“Weren’t you crying the other month,” Red said, “because of what you\ndid to them?”\n“I was drunk,” Gaz said. “You can’t trust a man when he’s drunk. He’ll\naccidentally say things he ain’t ready to say yet. Anyway, weren’t we going\nto try out that armor?”\nShallan considered, and pictured the scene. Kaladin with Light streaming\noff him, sending his armor out to protect.\nSad to miss the invasion, Veil noted.\nBy all accounts it was awful, Shallan replied.\nYeah, but how nifty would it have been to skulk around the tower while it\nwas under enemy rule?"

It had seemed, right when she’d reintegrated, that Veil would be\ngone completely, but what good would healing be if it meant losing part of\nherself—a part she loved—forever? More and more, she was feeling that\nreintegration wasn’t about rejecting Veil or Radiant, but embracing them\nand acknowledging in a healthy way that different parts of her had different\nneeds, different goals, different ideas.\nFor her, this was what healing felt like. Not losing control to her\npersonalities, but also making their strengths part of her. But, back to the\nmatter at hand. She waved her hands at Red and commanded the armor. Go\nto him.\nShallan! the armor predictably replied.\nHim. Go protect him. That guy.\nShe felt only confusion in response. So, she took Red by the arm and\nimagined the armor forming around him.\nDo that.\nShallan!\nThe armor emerged around Red, and she didn’t miss that it appeared as\nshe pictured it: with swirls of color like ribbons of wet paint, poured\ntogether, all in shades of metallic red. The shape was also slightly different\n—sleeker, like it could be worn underneath a coat, rather than hulking like\nAdolin’s Shardplate.\nRed laughed in excitement, puffing with an explosive awespren, his\nvoice echoing in the helm. Shallan stepped back. And Red stood there.\nMotionless. Arms out.\n“Um …” Red’s voice said. “I can’t move …”\n“You can’t?” Gaz said.\nMove, Shallan commanded the armor. It burst apart and vanished.\nThey tried again. Again, once she stepped away, Red was left\nmotionless. He couldn’t so much as bend his finger.\n“Shardplate needs power to move,” Darcira said. “So … maybe it’s not\npowered?”\n“So why does it work for the Windrunners?” Red said, his voice muffled.\n“This really isn’t fair.”\n“I think it’s brilliant,” Gaz said. “Shallan, if we tip him over, do you\nthink he’ll just lie there until we get back from breakfast?”\nShallan dismissed the armor, smiling. Shallan? the voices asked. They\n… were embarrassed.\nIt’s fine, she projected to them. You’re new to this.\nMaybe she could get them some kind of tutoring from … um … other\nbits of armor?\n“Well, I guess no free armor for me,” Red said. “I’ll have to go back to\nwhimpering at night about my dark secrets until I can find a way past\nthem.”\n“Is your dark secret that your sense of humor is awful?” Gaz said.\n“Nah, that’s out in the open,” Red said, settling at the table. “So … are\nwe actually going to take on the Ghostbloods? Directly?”\nShallan checked the others. They nodded. Even Gaz.\n“How do we begin?” Darcira asked."

Even Gaz.\n“How do we begin?” Darcira asked.\n“Mraize always thinks he has the upper hand,” Radiant said. “He thrives\non keeping people off-balance by dangling information like bait. The best\nway to nullify his advantage is to uncover his secrets. There’s so much\nwe’re ignorant about. Why do they want Mishram’s prison? Why did they\nget involved so deeply in our politics? So we’re going to find the answers.”\nShe glanced down at the table, at Mraize’s smirking scarred face. “We’re\ngoing to do something they don’t think is possible: we’re going to steal\nthose secrets.”\n“All right,” Gaz said. “But how?”\n“First,” she said, “we need to find their base …”\n“What are you doing here?” Dalinar demanded as he caught up to the\nwoman … the god. Damnation, this was her. He’d last seen her in a\ndarkened grove, but her face was exactly the same.\n“I go where I please,” she said, sounding amused, a few lifespren\ndrifting around her. “Should I not?”\nAs before, there was the faintest hint of the sound of crumbling stone to\nher voice. Her clothing looked as if she had grown the dress from delicate\nwebs of something fine and earthy, and it in places merged back with her\nskin. Neither effect was as dramatic as it had been in the Valley, perhaps to\nnot draw attention. But he was shaken nonetheless. A Fused trick? Could it\n…\nNo. Fused powers wouldn’t work in the tower. This was Cultivation. He\nstopped beside the metal railing, holding it for support.\n“I remember you,” he said.\n“I know. You wrote it in your book. I take great pains to remain secret,\nDalinar, and you just vomited it all up on a page.” She shook her head.\n“Are you here to help?” he said. “Can you tell me how to defeat Odium?\nCan I use my Bondsmith powers?”\n“No, I cannot,” she said. People passed on the balcony, bowing to him or\nsaluting, but ignoring her. She, who was the greater of the two.\n“Why not?” he asked. “Why not explain?”\n“Haven’t you learned yet? You must find the answers yourself to respect\ntheir meaning.”\n“Pardon,” he said, “but that’s a load of crem. If you give me the answers,\nI absolutely promise to respect them.”\nShe smiled. “Have you wondered why you are a Bondsmith?”\n“To unite them,” he said.\n“Yes. And what does that mean?”\n“Many things, depending on interpretation,” he replied. Then he sighed.\n“Please just give me an answer?”\nShe idled beside the railing, tapping it, gazing down at the people of\nUrithiru below. “Have you ever known Odium to be frightened?”\nHad he?\nYes. Once during a crash of transcendent power. A time when he’d\nsworn he’d heard Evi’s voice, and had become his own man, freed from the\npast. A time when he’d stared a god in the eyes, slammed his hands\ntogether, and merged three realms.\nI am Unity."

A time when he’d stared a god in the eyes, slammed his hands\ntogether, and merged three realms.\nI am Unity.\n“Once,” Dalinar said softly.\n“I have once as well,” she said. “One time, other than when you faced\nhim. It is deep in the past.” She idly held up her hand, lifespren swirling and\nplaying around it. “You need to take a journey, Dalinar Kholin. A dangerous\none, but the path to defeating Odium is not through your powers alone. It is\nthrough understanding. You need to see the history of this world, live it.”\n“Visions?” he asked. “Like I’ve seen before?”\n“Greater,” she said. “Where is Honor?”\n“Dead.”\n“Tanavast—the Vessel that once held Honor—is dead, but the power\nremains. Somewhere. It’s a conundrum that few scholars even know to\nponder upon. None know what became of Honor’s power. Have you any\nguesses?”\n“It’s the spren, maybe,” Dalinar said.\n“Some say that Honor was Splintered by Odium when he killed Tanavast\n—as he did to others before—becoming the spren, as the power of a god\nleft alone will begin to think.” She shook her head. “But they’re wrong. The\nspren existed before Tanavast’s death. They are of him, but are not the core\nof his power. It still exists.” She looked him in the eyes. “It is the power and\nsubstance of the visions you were shown, starting years ago. It seeks for\nmen to see their heritage, as it searches for a new Vessel to hold it.”\n“Wait,” Dalinar said, a cold shock starting at the base of his skull and\nwashing through him, making him grip the banister. “Wait. What are you\nsaying? That … someone could …?”\n“Honor’s power needs a host,” she said. “Whether or not that is you, and\nwhether or not that solves your problems, remain to be seen. However, I’m\nhere to tell you that years ago, you started on a path—and touched the\npower of Honor each highstorm when you saw a vision. The path to\ndefeating Odium is the same one you’re walking. You simply need to see\nbetter, farther, and deeper into the past.”\n“Could you not fight him?”\n“I have my own battles,” she said, turning to trail away. “I cannot fight\nyours, but you now know where the power hides. Seek the Spiritual Realm,\nwhere gods dwell. You have the ability to get there, perhaps even the ability\nto return. There you will receive the final truths of the Heralds, the\nRadiants, and Honor himself. Go and seek it, Dalinar Kholin, if you would\nfinish this journey.”\nShe walked a short distance, until darkness swallowed her, and she\nvanished in a pop of lifespren. Dalinar walked back to the others, who were\nsurrounded by shockspren. Without a word, he pointed upward. Sigzil\nLashed him and he went soaring, two Windrunners joining him. Only when\nhe was already in the air did he realize he’d left his bodyguard behind yet\nagain. Well, Colot could take the lift.\nThe Spiritual Realm. The powers of gods."

Just now.\nWhat? the Stormfather said, suddenly present fully in Dalinar’s mind,\nmaking the air warp nearby. Incredible. She almost never leaves her hiding\nplace.\nYou didn’t sense her?\nShe hides from Odium, he sent. Which means none of us can sense her\neither. She must have come to see what was happening with the Sibling.\nCultivation was ever fond of them.\nCultivation told me, Dalinar said, that Honor’s power still exists in the\nSpiritual Realm—that it is the substance of the visions I’ve seen. She says I\nshould seek answers there.\nThe Stormfather rumbled softly. A dangerous kind of thunder, distant,\nbut warning of imminent violence.\nWould you take that step, Dalinar? the spren asked. Do you seek to lose\nyourself in the past?\nThey reached the top floors of Urithiru.

He gripped the\nbanister, looking down hundreds of feet. A vertigo-inspiring sight. He’d felt\nas though he’d been standing at a precipice for years now, a single step\nfrom demise. Once, if he’d trembled before a battle, it had been with\nexcitement. Now it was because of the daunting realization that everything\nrested upon him. By his design.\nIf he lost this contest …\nI can see that you are nervous, the Stormfather said. Good. Confidence\nin a mortal should only go so far. What else did Cultivation tell you?\nJust that the Spiritual Realm has answers, Dalinar said. That I can get\nthere with my powers. That I should seek the truths of history, and of Honor.\nThe Stormfather rumbled, sounding annoyed by this.\nWhat? Dalinar asked.\nI’ve shown you what you need, he replied. Too much more is dangerous.\nWait, Dalinar thought. There is more? Could I see how the Heralds were\nchosen? How people came to Roshar? Could I see what caused Honor to\ndie?\nThe Stormfather rumbled softly, and sounded even angrier.\nCultivation indicated I should seek these answers, Dalinar said.\nI did not think she would interfere except in her usual way, the\nStormfather said. That of making tiny nudges that require decades to\nmature. I will have to think on it. Her suggestion is dangerous, Dalinar. Too\ndangerous. Take care.\nWith that, the Stormfather turned his attention elsewhere.

Wit sat\non the floor at the rear, holding a scroll of paper in one hand and some kind\nof white bone in the other.\n“What’s he doing?” Dalinar asked Jasnah.\n“Something’s wrong,” she explained, arms folded as she watched him.\n“He had an encounter with Odium that he only just remembered—which\nmeans Odium altered his memories. That, for reasons he hasn’t explained,\nmakes him think there are loopholes in the contract that Odium is\nexploiting.”\n“There can’t be,” Dalinar said. “Odium promised me—confirmed true by\nWit himself—that he wouldn’t use any loopholes. That the soul of the\ncontract was more important.”\nJasnah shook her head. “We’ll get answers from Wit—if we’re lucky—\non his timeline, not ours.” She seemed expressly annoyed with Wit.\n“Well,” Dalinar said, getting out battle maps and waving in the generals\nwaiting outside, “let’s get an accurate accounting of our troop placements\nso we can be ready to present to the monarchs.

Adolin gave a\nshout and ran for the lift, towing Colot behind him. Before the attendants\ncould close the gate, the emperor himself—swathed in thick robes and\nwearing a headdress several feet wide—raised his hand, pausing them.\nAdolin and Colot hopped onto the lift, and Adolin nodded to the emperor\nin thanks. It was crowded full of Azish dignitaries. Wherever Emperor\nYanagawn went, he had to bring viziers, servants, functionaries, servants to\nthe functionaries …\nThe lift started creeping up the wall of the atrium. Then it picked up\nspeed. Within seconds, they were going so fast that Adolin felt the wind of\nit—something that had never happened before the tower’s awakening. At\nthis rate, the ride to the top would take barely a few minutes.\n“Highprince Adolin,” Yanagawn said from the center of his retinue.\n“Might I have a word?”\nNearby, several of the viziers glanced at one another, though none said\nanything. The young emperor wasn’t technically supposed to speak to\nanyone beneath him, but he and Adolin had interacted on and off during the\nyear since the Battle of Thaylen Field. Yanagawn had started talking to\nAdolin directly.\n“Your Excellency?” Adolin said, stepping closer as several guards\nreluctantly made space for him.\n“You saw the armies advancing on my homeland,” Yanagawn said. “The\nreport is that they are … vast?”\n“It’s a pretty decent invasion force,” Adolin admitted. “Maybe fifteen or\ntwenty thousand.”\n“We have a fraction of that in the capital,” Yanagawn said. “Most of our\narmies are out on campaign.” He shook his head, seated in his chair amid\nthem all. They carried a seat for him wherever he went—and sometimes\nthey carried him upon it. “We thought we’d be safe after driving the enemy\nback in Emul. Even with the contest, will it ever end?”\n“I wish I knew, Your Excellency.”\nYanagawn was in many ways baffling to Adolin—a figurehead more\nthan a king. Like a Soulcast statue, powerful in station, but somehow\npersonally impotent. Jasnah thought this was a good thing; Adolin had tried\nto follow her explanations why. It made sense when she talked about checks\non absolute power, but Jasnah could make anything sound reasonable. It\nwas one of her gifts.\n“You fight directly for your people,” Yanagawn said softly to him. “With\nsword in hand. Are you ever frightened you won’t be strong enough,\nHighprince?”\n“You can call me Adolin, if you’d like.”\n“I … cannot offer you the same courtesy.”\n“I understand,” Adolin said. “And in answer to your question: yes.

The\ntype of stealth pain that didn’t ache until you moved the wrong way, and\nsuddenly it flared up—a sharp spike in your side. He would remember\nactivating the Oathgate. Leaving wounded soldiers behind, an entire city\nfull of people that he was supposed to have rescued. His cousin Elhokar\ndead on the stones …\nYeah, that one storming hurt.\n“How do you bear it?” Yanagawn asked.\n“Exercise helps,” Adolin said. “Training with my sword, clearing my\nmind.”\n“Sometimes I think it is a blessing that my station doesn’t let me fight,”\nYanagawn said. Storms, his Alethi was so good. He had an accent, yes, but\nhe’d only been practicing for a year or so. “I do not make the tactical\ndecisions, and so the burden of failure is not my own. At other times, I find\nmyself a coward.”\n“It’s not cowardly to know your own limitations, Excellency,” Adolin\nsaid.\n“Maybe,” Yanagawn said, then smiled fondly. “Do you know my\nbackground, Adolin?”\n“I believe you were a darkeyes … er, whatever you call it … before your\nelevation.”\n“A commoner, yes,” he said. “A thief. And not a very good one at that.”\nMore side glances from the viziers. Noura, their foremost, stepped\ncloser. “Pardon, Excellency and Highness, but that is the path Yaezir put\nyou upon, and is how you were to be manifest to us via miracle.”\n“That doesn’t change what I was, Noura.”\n“Yes, Excellency,” she said. “But dwelling on what you were, instead of\nwhat you are, never gets a person far.”\nAdolin nodded. He could never have lived with so many attendants, but\nNoura … she was at least thoughtful.\n“I mention it,” Yanagawn said, “not to dwell upon it, but to remember a\ntime when I was commonly put into dangerous situations. I did not handle it\nwell then. I often wonder … how would I handle it now?” He looked to\nNoura, and Adolin saw in him the man—not the youth. He was older than\nAdolin had been when he’d first won his Shardblade.\nThis fellow, Adolin thought, needs a good session training with the\nsword.\nIt wasn’t Adolin’s place to say so, not here. So he held his tongue as the\nlift reached the top, and they stepped out. It was time to decide how they\nwere going to face this threat.\nRadiant leaned back against the wall of the lift atrium’s ground floor.\nCourtesy of Shallan’s Lightweaving, she wore the face of a crem scraper.\nHe was a man with long features, drooping as if waxen.\nAdolin got on the lift with the Azish contingent, while Isom—the\nLightweaver she’d tasked with tailing him—gave a covert signal, indicating\nhe’d take the next lift up. Shallan had been worried when Isom reported\nAdolin hadn’t gone straight to the meeting. Of course he’d gone to check on\nhis horse. Again."

Besides,\nsurely the enemy wouldn’t try something in the middle of a meeting of\nkings, queens, and a bunch of Radiants.\nYou’ve done what you can there, Veil said.\nNow her plans depended on one of her Lightweavers being able to tail a\nGhostblood to their current hideout. Gaz was with her, wearing the face of a\nyoung woman who sold rockbud flowers in the market. One of his better\nsketches—and better disguises, as it made use of his shorter height.\n“No reports of Ghostbloods tailing any of our people today,” Gaz said\nsoftly. His Lightweaving had progressed far enough that his voice was\nstarting to modulate as well as his image. “They haven’t even attacked the\nhorse. You think they’re waiting to make us placid?”\nRadiant considered. “No. They don’t want to draw attention. A petty\nstrike at someone Shallan loves would give them a moment of satisfaction,\nbut would bring the full weight of Dalinar’s anger down on them. Mraize is\nmore subtle than that.”\nGaz grunted, a sound that did not match the face he was wearing. He\nneeded more practice. To that end, now that she had checked on Adolin,\nRadiant gave way to Shallan, who slouched further, shoved her hands in her\npockets, and started chewing on her lip—all very un-Shallan-like behaviors\n—to help sell the disguise.\n“No threats,” Shallan whispered with a man’s voice. “No contact. I’d\nhoped we could stop a strike against one of us, then tail the perpetrators.\nThis silence is unnerving. We need to find out what they’re up to, Gaz.”\n“We have agents watching tower entrances and major corridors,” Gaz\nsaid. “But even with our paid informants, I can’t guarantee we’ll pick up a\nGhostblood’s trail.”\nShallan nodded as she chewed her lip, thoughtful. “Ghostbloods won’t\nbe able to stay away from today’s developments. They didn’t interfere with\nAdolin, but they’re watching. They’ll be doing the same for Dalinar,\nNavani, and anyone else they think might know something. Eventually one\nof us will spot someone to follow.”\nGaz nodded slowly, relaxing against the wall with a leisurely air. Shob,\none of the other Lightweavers, would be here in a few minutes with his\nreport. In the past, Gaz had scratched at his stubble and spent half his time\nnervously checking his former blind spot. Both actions were far less\ncommon while he was in disguise, as he’d tempered the behaviors.\n“You’re getting better at this,” Shallan noted.\n“Thanks,” he said. “I needed something to do with my time.”\n“How’s the gambling?”\nHe shrugged.\n“How much in debt are you this week?”\n“Nothing,” he said.\n“That’s an improvement.”\n“Only because I managed to stay away completely,” he said. “That\nadvice you gave about giving myself a budget and only losing that much?”"

It’s why I wound up in the bridge crews, under the thumb of a pair\nof petty lighteyes. It’s why I ended up deserting. No budget will work for\nme. Just gotta do somethin’ else.”\n“Is that difficult?” she asked, thinking of her brother who had the same\nproblem. Maybe what worked for Gaz would help Jushu.\n“Yeah. I used to spend all my days planning how to score,” he said.\n“Strategies—most of them useless. I’d build up in my mind how each play\nwould be one gust in what became a storm of winnings, digging me out of\nmy problems. Each win felt good, like I was taking a step toward being\nworth something.”\nDisgustspren, like orange corkscrews drilling downward, appeared\naround him as he continued. “It’s not the gambling itself that got me. It’s\nthat I built up how it would feel to win, only to come crashing down each\ntime, leaving me feeling like I’d missed out on something I was owed. That\nmade me dull to everything else. Till I was a man without a heart, sending\nboys off to die each day on those bridge runs.”\n“And then …”\n“I found you all,” he said. “People who care about me.”\n“And the power of being loved,” Shallan said softly, a smile rising on\nher lips, “gave you the strength to resist.”\n“What?” He belted out a laugh, half his voice, half that of his illusion.\n“What kind of storming crem is that! The power of being loved? Ha! No,\nStargyle and Red went to every gambling den in the whole storming tower\nand threatened the folks that run them! Said if anyone let me in, Stargyle\nwould rip their toenails off and wear them as a necklace. When I came by,\nthe staff wouldn’t even talk to me!”\n“Well,” she said, “that is the power of being loved. Simply, um, a\ndifferent hue.”\n“A tough kind of love.”\n“A toe-uf kind of love.”\nHe looked at her.\n“Toe,” she said. “For feet. Toenails.”\nHe just kept staring at her.\n“Hey, I’m out of practice,” she said. “There was this whole thing with\nanother personality almost manifesting, and it didn’t leave time for\nwitticisms. Anyway, remind me to send Red and Stargyle a thank-you\nnote.”\n“Storming fools,” Gaz grumbled. “But it worked. After a while, my mind\nfound other ways to spend its time. The work we do, that’s got more of a\nreal thrill to it: the plans, the watching, the tailing. Now the strategies I\nthink of are actually accomplishing something.” He checked his belt, where\none of their spanreeds was blinking. “Damnation. That’s Shob. He’s spotted\na Ghostblood.

By tradition, Yanagawn picked up\nhis own seat and carried it in, and Adolin did the same, grabbing one from\noutside. Navani and Dalinar liked the symbolism.\nInside, Adolin did a quick count of those in attendance, and saw he and\nYanagawn were last. His father and aunt were there, as were Jasnah and\nQueen Fen. A few Radiant representatives, including Sigzil for the\nWindrunners and Stargyle for the Lightweavers, were placing their seats.\nThere were also a couple of the lesser kings—or “primes” as they called\nthem—from the Azish Empire. The Mink had come as well—the short\nHerdazian who was their key strategist. And possibly, following the fall of\nhis kingdom, Herdaz’s ranking lighteyes. Even if he was actually darkeyed.\nThe meeting was rounded out by three other Alethi highprinces, a group\nof scribes, and several generals and important leaders—like Prince Kmakl\nand Noura the vizier. And of course there was Wit, sitting in the corner with\na scroll across his lap. Aunt Navani waved, and all the gathered emotion\nspren in the room flew out—to not distract. Adolin closed the door. Maybe\nhe should have greeted his father, whom he hadn’t seen in weeks. He\nglanced toward Dalinar.\nNo. After how they’d parted, they’d do the proper thing: ignore it and let\nit fester.\nMere seconds after he’d closed the door, there was a knock on it. Adolin\npeeked, then pulled it all the way open as one of the guards gestured to an\nolder Reshi man wearing a loose robe that showed a powerful chest and a\nstrong build. Adolin thought he was one of the leaders of their islands who\nhad been visiting the tower these last few months.\nThey’d never invited him to any of their meetings. The man didn’t ask;\nhe simply picked up a chair and stood outside, waiting with his son, who\noften wore Thaylen clothing.\nAdolin glanced into the chamber. This man was king to only a few\nhundred, less powerful in his sphere than a lower Alethi landowner. He was\nRadiant—the sole Dustbringer left in the tower—but not many Radiants got\nto join the meeting."

You should have insisted that the borders freeze the moment the deal\nwas struck.”\nShe was right, of course, but this was how it was with Adolin’s father.\nDalinar was a great man, yes, but he was confident in his greatness. Which\nled him to assume he could solve any problem himself.\n“I’m sorry, Fen,” Dalinar said. “I’m doing my best.”\n“Your best is going to see my kingdom conquered while you protect\nyours!

Doing whatever you want.\nConsequences be storming damned. Like you did years ago, killing my\nmother. And you never bothered to tell me. You—\n“You did well, Dalinar Kholin,” Yanagawn said. “We agreed to let you\nstand for us, and you found us a solution. Thank you.”\nAdolin frowned, looking at the Azish emperor. His homeland was facing\ninvasion. Why was he so calm?\n“Because of you,” Yanagawn continued, “we have a chance. The enemy\ncan be reborn again and again, but with the contest, peace is actually\npossible.”\n“I failed you in the short term,” Dalinar said. “Armies are coming for\nyour homeland.”\n“As they were three days ago,” Yanagawn said. “And the weeks before\nthat. All that has changed is that you have ensured there is an end in sight.\nYes, the contract could have been a little better, but I think every Azish\nperson in this room can admit that even with important documents, you\nalways miss something.”\n“Well that’s storming true,” Sigzil said, laughing."

We did agree to let you make the decision, and you did all you could.\nI shouldn’t grouse about what could have been, but my homeland only just\nstarted to recover from the last attack.”\n“We merely need to hold out, Fen,” Yanagawn said. “For eight more\ndays. Then we have peace.”\nStorms. With that, the tone of the room changed again. Or perhaps\nAdolin hadn’t been reading it correctly in the first place. People nodded.\nFen sat up a little straighter. And Dalinar … Dalinar met Yanagawn’s eyes,\nthen bowed his head in a sign of respect and thanks.\nWhen had the young emperor learned such maturity? Or … perhaps\nAdolin should be wondering why he hadn’t learned the same.\n“Very well,” Dalinar said. “Let’s discuss our positions. Stargyle, you up\nto making a map with me?”\n“Yes, sir,” the Lightweaver said. “After the last few weeks of practice, I\nthink I can manage it.”\n“Good,” Dalinar said. “We’ll begin in Emul, with—”\n“Holy hell,” a voice said from the corner.\nAdolin frowned, trying to figure out those words and how they fit\ntogether. The group parted, revealing Wit sitting in the corner, holding that\npaper and what looked like a bone. “It’s not possible,” Wit said, louder.\nAdolin glanced toward Jasnah, who shook her head, as confused as he\nwas.\n“I’m an idiot,” Wit said.\n“Wit?” Dalinar asked. “Are you—”\nWit leapt to his feet. “I’m an absolute fool! The most awe-inspiring,\nspectacular example of idiocy this side of the cosmere. So grand, I should\nbe immortalized in song. The type that drunk men sing before they puke,\nmixing the rancid contents of their poisoned stomachs with my name.”\n“Wit,” Dalinar said firmly. “Explain yourself.”\nWell, that seemed like an invitation for mockery. Adolin braced himself,\nbut when Wit spoke his voice was serious.\n“There are loopholes in this agreement,” Wit explained. “I’m sorry; I\nfailed you all. I was supposed to shepherd the process of creating this\ncontract. I could have seen exactly where these attacks would land, if I’d\nbeen more keen-eyed.”\nHe said it solemnly. Quietly. What could make Wit be so … normal?\n“How could you have guessed they’d strike at Thaylen City?” Fen asked.\n“Because it’s in this agreement,” Wit said, “blatant as my own nose. As\nyou all know, Dalinar was forced a little off script in creating this three days\nago.”\n“Odium insisted he couldn’t accept the deal as presented,” Dalinar said\nto the room. “Because he can no longer keep the Fused imprisoned.”\n“Locking them away is no longer viable,” Wit agreed, “with the\nOathpact broken and the Everstorm in place. Regardless, Dalinar going off"

        "text": "“Locking them away is no longer viable,” Wit agreed, “with the\nOathpact broken and the Everstorm in place. Regardless, Dalinar going off\nscript led to this situation—where the enemy has one last chance to grab\nlands.”\n“Which is why we’ve been expecting an attack on the borders in\nstrategically valuable places,” the Mink said, standing beside Dalinar. “If\nthey expand the size of Alethkar, for example, but then we win it back …\nwell, their attack was wasted. So we assumed some encroachment from Jah\nKeved on the Frostlands, or maybe another push into Emul or Tashikk. Key\nis that Alethkar and Herdaz are ours, forever, if Dalinar wins.”\nThe Herdazian looked to Dalinar and nodded in respect. Adolin hadn’t\nheard all the details of the contract, but he’d been told that Dalinar had\nspecifically singled out Herdaz for freedom. The mark of a promise kept.\nDalinar nodded back. Adolin’s father was standing—because of course\nhe’d forgotten to bring his chair. Despite the grand philosophies he\nespoused, Dalinar was always an exception to the rules. Even his own.\nStorms, Adolin thought, acknowledging the bitterness lacing his\nthoughts. I’m really, really letting this go too far.\nHe knew it. But he couldn’t stop it.\n“The Mink is right,” Dalinar said. “Whatever happens, Odium keeps the\nlands that surrendered to him, such as Iri, Jah Keved, and Marat. We keep\nwhatever we hold when the deadline arrives. Strikes against Thaylen City\nand Azimir are not completely outrageous—but they don’t seem a smart\nchoice. Why risk everything on capturing our strongholds when it’s much\nmore possible to grab land at the perimeter?”\n“Because,” Wit whispered, “if he takes the capitals, he gets the\nkingdoms. In their entirety.”\n“Wait,” Yanagawn said. “What did you say?”\n“I realized earlier that I might have missed something,” Wit said. “So, I\nsent a request to one of the best contract negotiators I know. Frost. Tall\nfellow. Big as a house, actually. Sharp teeth. Fondness for chastising me,\nwhich shows he has good judgment. He refused to help, as he insists he will\nnot intervene, but his sister is as smart as he is, and she listened. I read her\nthe contract, and she needed access to the Alethi legal code. That’s what\nI’ve been doing for these past hours—reading her laws, talking her through\nit, asking for her explanations.”\n“And you did this … right here?” Navani asked. “How?”\nWit held up the little bone, as if that explained everything. “The general\nidea is this: In Dalinar’s negotiations, he argued for the return of Alethkar\nand Herdaz. Entire kingdoms. Then he agreed to Odium’s request: Odium\ncan try for entire kingdoms with his attacks. By Alethi law, this means that\nhe has to capture their seat of power. So …”\n“So he throws everything he has at Azimir,” Yanagawn whispered.\n“Because if he can take it, he claims the kingdom. That’s what you’re\nsaying?”\n“Unfortunately, yes,” Wit said."

The room fell silent.\n“He promised me,” Dalinar whispered, “that there would be no taking\nadvantage of loopholes. That he would hold to the spirit of the contest. You\nhad to dig through the Alethi legal code for hours to find this. It sounds a lot\nlike a loophole to me.”\n“Yes,” Wit said. “And that’s why I’m an idiot. Not because I missed the\nintricacies of the legal code—but because this isn’t something that Rayse\ncould ever do. It’s not only against his nature, it’s something he promised he\nwould not do. Even without a formal covenant, a god cannot break that kind\nof promise without dire consequences.”\n“So … what?” Dalinar said. “I’m missing something.”\n“As are we all,” Wit said with a sigh. “Odium is exploiting a loophole in\nyour agreement. Rayse wouldn’t do that. Rayse couldn’t do that. So …” He\nlooked around the room, meeting their eyes. “So we are not facing Rayse.\nMy old enemy must be dead, and someone else has taken up the Shard of\nOdium. I should have seen it the moment he started acting so oddly, but\nnow I’ve confirmed it by sensing the rhythms of Roshar. My friends, we are\nfacing an enemy we do not know and cannot anticipate. And whoever it is,\nthey’re a genius—one who has devised a ploy to conquer all of Roshar in\nten days.”\n“All right,” Shob said, huddling in an alcove with Shallan and Gaz up on\nthe third floor. “Look at these.”\nShallan and Gaz had taken different faces, all three of them now\nappearing like Herdazian workers. Gaz had a real sparkflicker on his finger,\nwith some flint to fake working it. Shob blew his nose, then set out some\npages for them on the ground. It was quieter here, with less traffic, though\nsound still echoed up through the nearby atrium.\n“Oi was watching the atrium region,” Shob said. “Like you said. Oi\nspotted someone spyin’ on Dalinar as he talked to some Makabaki woman.\nThe Ghostblood was this one here.”\nShallan took the page, a sketch of a short Alethi or Veden woman Hoid\nhad identified as a Ghostblood, but not one Shallan had ever met. At the\nbottom he’d written: former actor, recruited recently.\nActor, eh? She supposed that wasn’t an unusual recruitment tactic for a\nsecretive organization.\n“You set a tail on her?” Shallan asked.\n“Darcira is followin’ right now,” Shob said, rubbing his nose again. The\nman was always bemoaning some ailment or another—none of which were\never as debilitating as he thought. He was good at his job though. This was\na solid lead.\nThe Ghostbloods regularly set up, then abandoned bases. They were also\nfantastically good at losing tails, but a new recruit?

This seemed a weak\npoint.\nShob leaned back, complaining about his stomach while Shallan looked\nover the sketch once more, noting the woman’s tattoo peeking out through\nher freehand sleeve. Hoid’s sketches were excellent.\nShallan rubbed her wrist, where she’d refused to get one of those same\ntattoos. She flipped through the sketches and pulled out the picture of\nMraize: tall and distinguished—scarred and proud of it. She … didn’t hate\nhim. For all his threats and manipulations, he was too complex a man to be\nhated. She felt frustration mixed with envy, accompanied by a bitter sadness\nabout what could perhaps have been.\nShe would have to kill him. As she’d killed Tyn. As she’d killed her\nfather. But she would not enjoy it.\nThe next sketch was Iyatil in her mask. Even the sketch of her was\nshadowed, and Hoid noted he didn’t catch sight of her often. The next two\npictures were those masked newcomers—assassins brought in from Iyatil’s\nhomeland, wearing wooden masks painted in a way that made them feel …\nfeatureless. Just shapes and lines, not people, except for those eyes staring\nout, and the mouths barely exposed at the bottom.\nAs she was studying those pictures a soldier strolled past and glanced at\nShallan’s group. Gaz casually held up one of the pages to be more visible,\nbut it suddenly depicted a busty woman in a state of complete undress.\nShallan blushed, drawing a shamespren despite herself. The soldier\nchuckled and moved on.\n“Gaz,” she hissed.\n“What?” he said. “You have a better way to explain a bunch of street\nsweepers gathered around some papers?”\n“Where did you even get that image!”\n“Drew it myself,” he said, with a grunt. “You said we should take them\nart lessons. Gotta get the musculature right to learn proper Lightweaving.”\n“I know that!” she said, recalling some experiences in her youth. She\nshooed away that shamespren in the shape of a red flower petal. “But … my\nmodels were never quite so … um …”\n“Oi think somethin’s wrong with my heart,” Shob said from beside them,\nlying on his back now, eyes closed. “Oi think it stopped beating. Can’t feel\nit. Is that normal?” Shallan didn’t give it much thought—Shob was merely\nbeing his usual overdramatic self.\nGaz shook the page so the image vanished, returning to a depiction of a\nGhostblood. “You want me to invite you next time we do a drawing\nsession?”\n“Storms, no,” Shallan said, still blushing. “You’re not supposed to stare\nat models. It’s unprofessional.”\n“I don’t think those ladies and fellows mind,” Shob said. “On account of\ntheir other jobs.”\nStorms. Well, she did need anatomy practice.

But striking won’t do much good unless we know Mraize and\nIyatil are inside. Plus, like I said earlier, we need to find out what they’re\nplanning.”\n“Which means …” Gaz said.\n“We’ll use a strike team, yes,” Shallan said. “But we’re going to sneak in\nfirst.”\nGaz nodded and collected the pictures, then headed out. Shob was lying\ndown again. Shallan had always found his antics ridiculous, but today …\ntoday she hesitated, then tapped him on the foot while he looked up at the\nceiling.\n“Hey,” she said softly. “Hey, you all right?”\n“Oi know Oi probably am,” he replied. “Oi know it’s just in my head, all\nthese things Oi feel. So yeah, Oi suppose. It ain’t real.”\nShallan suddenly felt guilty. She’d dismissed his attitude as silly earlier.\nHow many would call what she dealt with “silly”?\n“Hey,” she said. “Feeling real is enough. The things in our heads can be\nsome of the most important things in our lives. Love is in our heads.\nConfidence. Integrity. All things we make up, but they’re still very\nimportant.”\nHe sat up. “And me feelin’ sick all the time? Is that good, like love or\nintegrity?”\n“Probably not,” she said. “But it being in your head doesn’t mean we\nshould ignore it. You need any help?”\nHe cocked his head, illusion covering his face, but his eyes—his\nexpressions—showed his true self. “Nobody’s ever asked me that. You\nknow? In years, nobody’s asked me that? Yeah. Yeah, Oi think Oi could use\nsome help.” He hesitated. “But Oi don’t know. Sometimes … when people\nlisten to me … it gets worse. Oi just start thinkin’ of more things wrong,\nthen ask for more and more sympathy. Till Oi hate myself, and everyone\nhates me.”\n“Ignoring the problem isn’t the solution though,” Shallan said. “Trust\nme. When we’re done with all this, let’s see if we can find someone who\ncan help. There has to be an ardent or a surgeon or someone.”\n“Okay,” he said, rising. “Oi think Oi just felt a heartbeat. So maybe Oi\nwill survive long enough.” He glanced at her, then paused. “Oi say\nexaggerations of what Oi feel like that because they’re funny. Makes people\nthink Oi’m jokin’. So they don’t hate me, you know?”\nShe took his hand, squeezed it, and nodded."

Outside, in the room with the\nguards, listening to what they’re chattering about.” Shob was excellent at\nthat kind of information-gathering, but his skill set wasn’t aligned with\nattacking enemies, as she was planning to try next.\n“Then Oi’d better find a lift up,” he said.

Dalinar had said he could wear what he\nwanted, and though Szeth was a Skybreaker, he had no uniform. Even\nduring training and official functions, they’d wear the uniform of the local\nguard or constables.\nStill, Szeth wore filmy white clothing that flapped in the wind as they\nflew. Still, Szeth shaved his head each day, and found the faintest prickle of\nstubble on his scalp an annoyance. Did he do these things because he\nwanted to, or because they were now tradition? Life could be so full of\ndistracting, meaningless small decisions while the large ones—such as\ndetermining his duty to his people—were so hard.\nSo he pretended it was right to continue his routines. If they were wrong\n—if instead he should have a preference among many tiny options … well,\nthat made him shudder to his core.\nHe did like flying though. During the days training with the Honorblades\nin his youth, taking to the sky had appealed to him most of all the powers.\nHe and Kaladin-son-Lirin had flown far with the storm, before sleeping in a\ncoalition camp near the base of the mountains.\nNow, at last, they approached the Misted Mountains at the edge of\nShinovar. They avoided the northern border, where Shin had been loosing\narrows at anyone who drew too close. Szeth figured these southern\nfarmlands would be better. It was also close to where he’d grown up, so he\nknew the region.\nWithin the rushing of the wind and the flapping of clothing in flight, he\ncould not hear the voices whispering or screaming from the shadows.\nThey’d been quiet for some time, so he thought he’d escaped them. It\nturned out they’d simply been lying in wait.\n“Is that the pass?” Kaladin’s voice came to him, cutting through the\nnoise, perfectly audible. Windrunning permitted sculpting airflow. Such\nconveniences were no longer available to Szeth. Nale had granted him leave\nto use Division, now that Szeth had reached the Third Ideal.

His\nspren said the time wasn’t right.\nRegardless, it was the correct pass, and seeing it made Szeth tremble. He\nand Kaladin lowered to some twenty feet off the ground, then proceeded,\nmountains on either side. They passed stonewalker plants for now—short,\nstout trees with leaves pulled in before the wind. Grass in tufts behind\nboulders or lying low in burrows.\nBut soon … soon they’d see …\nSoil. Dirt breaking the stone. Mud running alongside washes, sediment\nfilling the bottom of fissures. Here was where the highstorms finally\nsurrendered, Shinovar bringing the great eastern tyrant of the skies to his\nknees. A place where the lazy rainfall—like a corpse that had already bled\nout—no longer contained the minerals that hardened into cremstone.\nHere life could truly flourish. Szeth’s breath caught, and two gloryspren\nappeared above him, as he spotted mosses growing on rocks, leading to a\nfew scraggly weeds alongside the wash. Szeth cried out despite himself and\ncanceled his Lashings, dropping with a thump to this patch of soil. After so\nmany, many years, his booted feet fell not on blasphemous stone.\nHe hadn’t realized how it would overwhelm him. He fell to his knees\nbefore the dandelions and stared at them.\nKaladin alighted on a rock nearby, confusionspren—like streaks of violet\nextending from a central point—expanding behind him. He couldn’t know\nhow beautiful this tiny plant was. Szeth reached out with trembling fingers\nand touched leaves that didn’t pull back.\n“What’s wrong with that plant?” Kaladin asked. “Is this a sign of the\nproblems in your homeland?”\n“No,” Szeth whispered. “It is merely a weed. The most beautiful of\nweeds …”\nKaladin glanced to the side, where his spren landed and appeared as a\nfull-sized human in a skirted Bridge Four uniform, leggings underneath\nreaching down to mid-thigh. Szeth had not asked why she chose that form.\nIt was not for him to question.\n“Szeth,” said a voice.\nHis spren. A highspren.\nHe still did not know its name. It had never been offered. It was not a\ndistinction the highspren gave lightly, though some other Skybreakers had\nbeen granted the names of their spren.\n“This emotion is unfitting of your station,” the spren said, audible and\nvisible only to him. “Do not spoil your dignity with base sentimentality.\nYou serve the law.”\nSzeth, with effort, forced his hand away from the plant. He stood up.\nVoices. Had there ever been a time when his life hadn’t been ruled by\nvoices? Would he even know what to do if they stopped?\n“You all right?” Kaladin said, hopping off his rock.\nOh, I’m fine! said the sword strapped to Szeth’s back. Thank you.\nNobody has been paying attention to me today, but I’m famously patient. It\ncomes from being a sword.\nKaladin ignored the comment, stepping closer to Szeth."

He simply trusted that in the\nhighspren and Dalinar, he had chosen better masters.\nHe stepped away as Kaladin knelt by the plant, Syl bending down next to\nhim. The rising sun behind sent sunlight streaming through this valley into\nShinovar, the land that swallowed that sun each night. Light created\nshadows—in the leeward side of stones, in crevices, and beneath the very\nblades of grass. As soon as he saw that, the whispers started once more.\nVoices of those he’d killed. Condemning him.\nKaladin poked the plant with his toe. Then again. “I knew about these,”\nhe said to his spren. “Everyone mentions them. But it’s so strange.\nShouldn’t it have been eaten by something?”\n“Maybe it tastes really bad,” Syl said. “Maybe that’s why there are fewer\nproper plants in Shinovar. Our plants get eaten first, because they’re\ndelicious.” She leaned over farther and tapped the plant, proving substantial\nenough to make it quiver.\n“It’s like a painting,” Kaladin whispered.\n“Or a statue,” Syl said. “You think it was Soulcast? That it was once a\nreal plant, and someone made it into this?”\nKaladin shook his head, then lifted his boot. Szeth found it amusing how\nKaladin rammed his foot down, then stopped with a jerk a fraction of an\ninch from the plant. Trying to get it to flinch.\nThis is a man, Szeth thought, who pulls back before crushing a weed.\n“No wonder you broke and gave up the spear,” Szeth said, “leaving your\nfriends to battle without you. You have grown into a coward, then?”\nKaladin pulled up sharply. “You shouldn’t say such things.”\n“I should not speak truth?” Szeth said, genuinely curious. “Or are you\nsaying I am not the one to tell you these things, as I have no authority over\nyou? Interesting.”\n“That’s not what I’m saying, Szeth,” Kaladin said.\n“Then you should stop talking,” Szeth replied. “Because if you cannot\nexplain what you mean, then why voice silly thoughts?”\nSzeth walked on, and reminded himself not to underestimate this man’s\nskill. Kaladin deserved at least some of his fearsome reputation. Before\nSzeth had died his first death, he had faced this man, fighting amid debris\nand breaking plateaus, red lightning crashing against white. Because of that\nday, Szeth’s soul remained only loosely connected to his body—though his\nafterimage was less pronounced now. As if he were slowly healing from\nthat revival.\n“I think these plants are neat,” Syl said. She seemed to be trying to\ndistract Kaladin from his annoyance at Szeth—which was an odd emotion\nto be displaying in the face of true statements expressed clearly.\n“I suppose we’ll get used to them,” Kaladin finally said, flying ahead"

He couldn’t help asking. “Hiding among normal\nplants?”\n“What?” Kaladin said, turning in the air. “Oh. They can’t hide, because\nthey don’t move? Still seems strange to me that they can survive. I know\nthe storms aren’t strong here, but people and animals are going to step on\nthem.”\n“They’re more resilient than you think,” Szeth said.\n“Yeah, but once the real plants retract,” Kaladin said, “these will be\nsitting out in the open. Like the lone soldier in a company with no armor\non.”\nSzeth contained his amusement—his spren would not be happy to see\nsuch an emotion—and instead joined Kaladin flying along the pass. Soon\nthey reached a point where the path turned steeply downward, giving them\na view—for the first time—of Shinovar itself.\nGreenery covered the landscape. Vines across the valley walls; grass\nwaving on the path. Trees below in a vast forest along the slope—beyond\nthat the expansive open prairies of the lowlands.

Odium is no longer Rayse.\n“You can tell?” Dalinar whispered, so Navani could hear too. “So\neasily?”\nYes. The tone has changed, only noticeable when I looked.\nYou … are right, the Sibling said.

Take care. And\nRayse … Rayse is gone, after all this time.\n“You sound regretful,” Navani whispered.\nOnly that my lightning did not strike his corpse, the Stormfather spat.\nAnd my wind did not dash it against stones until it broke.\nHis rumbling faded.\nI miss how the Stormfather used to be, the Sibling said. He was so much\nhappier before. Not so angry all the time …\n“The Stormfather,” Dalinar said to the room, “has confirmed Wit’s\nintuition. Odium exists, but has changed hands. It’s like … like how a spren\ncan have a new Radiant.”\n“So …” Fen said, glancing around the circle, curled eyebrows shaking\nalongside her face. “Who cares?”\n“Who cares?” Yanagawn said. “This is our greatest enemy!”\n“Who is still trying to destroy us,” she said, “as evidenced by the\nimpending invasion. I never knew the old Odium, so it’s basically the\nsame.”\n“No,” Wit said. “It’s different.”\nAgain all eyes turned to him as he rose and walked into the center of the\ncircle. Even in a moment of stress like this, there was a certain\nshowmanship to Wit.\n“I knew the old Odium,” he said, spinning around to look at them all.\n“Our entire plan—the contract, the contest—was based in part on that\nknowledge. Now … I’m frightened. The old Odium was deeply calcified\ninto his position as a god—and was very unlikely to do anything that would\nrisk that position. The new one was likely a mortal before their Ascension.\nThey’ll be more brash, more willing to take risks.\n“More, they aren’t quite bound in the same way. Oh, they’ll have to keep\nthis agreement for the contest of champions—a formal agreement like that\nbinds the power, not just the individual, something Rayse himself\ndiscovered long ago. But lesser promises—like the one made to Dalinar\nabout not exploiting loopholes—are a different matter. He is breaking that\none easily, because he did not make it.”\n“So, wait,” Navani said, trying to understand the details. “Can a god\nbreak a contract, or can they not?”\n“Anyone, anywhere, can,” Wit explained. “God, human, spren.\nHowever, the consequences vary. For a deity, breaking a promise exposes\nthem to destructive forces from others—and the magnitude of the broken\npromise often determines the severity of the consequence.”\n“So …” Fen said. “Can we call off this contest? I don’t appreciate it\nallowing the conquering of my entire island if one city is captured.”\n“Yes, you have that option,” Wit said. “You always did—but if you break\nthe contract, Odium can retaliate in person. He could bring the full force of\nhis powers against you without risking retribution from other gods. Fen …\nhe could kill every person on this planet with a flick of his wrist, if he\nwanted.”\n“Well,” she said, sitting back. “That answers that.”\n“No breaking contracts with gods,” Kmakl said from behind Fen. “I’ll\nmake a note of that …”"

But that promise he made was not a formal agreement\ncertified by oaths. This is the hand we’re dealt. I’m sorry. I am not living up\nto my name. I should have seen this.”\nStorms, what a mess, Navani thought. “So if the enemy”—she tried to\nlay it out clearly—“can conquer the capitals of Azir, Thaylenah, or the\nShattered Plains in the next eight days … he keeps the equivalent kingdom\nin its entirety. No matter the results of the contest?”\n“Yes,” Wit said. “According to Alethi law.”\n“Could we change capitals?” Navani said.\n“That is a very clever idea,” Wit told her. “Which only a very clever\nperson would think of.”\n“Thank you, I …” She trailed off. “You’ve already thought of it, haven’t\nyou?”\n“Yes,” Wit said. “I asked my draconic friend, and got a negative\nresponse. How to explain this?” He thought a moment. “Alethi legal codes\napply here, and they are an absolute mess. A snarl of self-contradictory\ncodes, uncertain precedents, and insane laws that are still on the books\nbecause some drunk highprince thought they were amusing. Don’t show\nthem to the Azish. They’ll have nightmares for weeks.”\n“Too late,” Noura said. “I began studying them the moment we started\nthis coalition.”\n“Here’s the short of it,” Wit said, holding up the written-out version of\nDalinar’s agreement with Odium. “This is immutable. This stands. What\nOdium’s doing plays dirty, but does not break these rules. We could try to\ndo something similar, but changing the capital—or one of a dozen other\nvery clever things I came up with—would put us in violation.”\n“And,” Kmakl said, “we shouldn’t violate agreements with gods. I just\nmade a note of it, even.” He gave a wan smile.\nNavani took a deep breath. “All right then, we’re back to where we\nstarted—merely with a better understanding. Three armies are heading to\nthree capitals. We need to defend all three for eight days, and hope there are\nno other big surprises in the contract.”\n“I will speak to my friend,” Wit said. “I don’t think there’s anything else,\nbut if there is, I will find it. Honestly, most of what she said was\ncomplimentary. The agreement was well done, this small item\nnotwithstanding.”\n“The important point now is what to do next,” Jasnah said.\n“We stand united,” Dalinar said, looking around the room. “And we do\nnot give one inch of stone to him. Stargyle, let’s have a map.”\nStargyle stepped forward, and a brilliant, shimmering map of Roshar\nappeared in the center of the chamber.\nWhat is this? the Sibling said in Navani’s mind.

That is … that is\nincredible.\nLike the work of a master sculptor, the map had fine topographical\ndetail. It could be zoomed in until you could see cities, and zoomed out\nuntil it seemed as if you were gazing down from the moons upon a tiny\ncontinent surrounded by blue waters.\nNavani stood up, joining Dalinar and Stargyle at the side of the map. He\nreally was mastering this—a few weeks ago, only Shallan had been capable\nof the feat. Across the map, Noura provided a taller stool for her emperor.\nAs usual, the Mink stood and started walking straight through it—causing it\nto fuzz into Stormlight and churn in his passing, like eddies in a stream,\nuntil stabilizing again in place.\nIt wasn’t accurate to the moment—this represented the world as it had\nbeen the last time the highstorm had passed. Still, its majesty took Navani’s\nbreath away every time—and she was pleased that the Sibling was similarly\nimpressed.\nI’ve encountered nothing like this, they said in her mind. How? How can\nyou do things the ancient Radiants never did?\nScience is usually the product of incremental advances, shared across a\nbody of people working together, Navani said. But sometimes that group\nlimits you, because they make assumptions. I know there are many things\nwe’ve lost that the ancient Radiants did better—but at the same time, we’re\nnot limited by their expectations.\n“All right,” the Mink said. He was a shorter Herdazian man, lean of\nbuild, with a thin mustache and a wide, inviting smile—though his missing\ntooth and scarred wrists were a testament to the hardships he’d known.\n“First things first. Here are our current troop placements.”\nHe pointed at Emul, to the south of Azir. “The largest group of coalition\nforces—with many of our Stonewards and Edgedancers—are here. They\nwere fighting near the border with Tukar and Marat, and have been moving\nhome for three days now. Some of those—our rear guard, forty thousand\nstrong—are a six-day march from Azimir.”\n“Too far,” Yanagawn said. “The enemy will arrive before then, and my\nforces are down to only a few thousand. We’ll need reinforcement.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, walking past Navani to the eastern side of Roshar.\n“But from where? The rest of the bulk of our troops are here, holding the\nborders of Alethkar in the Frostlands.”\nThey’d been fighting an extended war against the enemy—and most of\ntheir clashes had been on these battle lines. Therefore, that was where their\ntroops were. Urithiru had reserves and off-duty soldiers, but many of them\nhad been slaughtered during the invasion and occupation. Navani had been\nwith them trying to hold out, and the nightmare of seeing so many soldiers\ngive their lives was a fresh wound. One she’d have to address someday,\nonce the crisis was over.\nIf the crisis was ever over.\n“We don’t have many troops who can reach an Oathgate in time,”"

One she’d have to address someday,\nonce the crisis was over.\nIf the crisis was ever over.\n“We don’t have many troops who can reach an Oathgate in time,”\nDalinar said. “We’re stretched incredibly thin, and we can’t move large\nbodies of troops quickly. Particularly not since we’ll need the Windrunners\nfor air support.”\n“We have scouts investigating each of the armies,” the Mink continued.\n“The fleet sailing for Thaylenah has over two hundred ships. They’re not\ngood for naval combat—mostly troop transports—which is why the\nblockade worked for so long. Now that it’s broken though, they could\ndeliver forty thousand soldiers to Thaylen City.”\n“Storms,” Fen whispered.\n“The force moving for Azimir is, fortunately, smaller,” the Mink said.\n“Approximately fifteen thousand, and barely a handful of Fused. It seems\nthey wanted to take us by surprise. Finally, the force marching on the\nShattered Plains is almost exclusively Fused—the most fearsome of the\narmies by far, though it’s only a thousand individuals.”\n“But they attack a mostly barren region,” Fen said.\n“Not barren,” Jasnah said. “That is the sole land my people have, in\nexile. Those are our lumberyards, our fields, and our new budding city at\nthe warcamps. It’s all we have.”\n“Still …” Fen said.\n“Let’s focus on the defense of Azir first,” the Mink said, holding up his\nhand, strolling through the mountains and to the west. “The enemy will\narrive midday tomorrow, best we can guess. You said you have … what,\nthree thousand city defenders?”\nKzal—one of the viziers—replied, “Yes, General.”\nThe Mink nodded to Dalinar and pointed. Navani stepped over as\nDalinar zoomed the map in until they could almost make out the signs of\nwarcamps on the flatlands south of Azimir.\n“This large army of ours is five or six days away,” the Mink mused. “If\nyour forces in Azimir hold out until then, you’ll win for certain. Even if you\nlose the city, that army of so many of our forces returning could maybe take\nit back …”\n“We can’t risk that though,” Adolin said, rising from his seat among the\nhighprinces in the second row. “We can’t just let Azimir be taken, maybe\nburned.” He walked through the map, and for some reason he’d summoned\nhis Shardblade—and was whispering to it? Navani sidled closer,\noverhearing what sounded like a quiet narration of what he was seeing.\nHow odd.\nThe Mink squatted down so he was eye level with the map. Navani\nwasn’t certain what advantage this provided, but he liked to do it, looking\nacross the landscape—in this case from the perspective of Azimir.\n“This is not a trap,” he said softly, smoothing his thin, greying mustache,\n“but the exploitation of an opportunity. They didn’t deliberately draw your\narmies away into Emul, otherwise they’d have struck already. They must\nhave sent this force through Shadesmar weeks ago.

        "text": "have sent this force through Shadesmar weeks ago. Ships do not materialize\nout of thin air.”\nThey do there, the Sibling noted. Though it requires Stormlight …\n“You have a strong position here, Yanagawn,” Dalinar said, gesturing.\n“You may not have a lot of troops, but the enemy has to come through the\nOathgate. The Skybreakers that were fighting in Emul have been withdrawn\nto strike at Thaylenah, and there are few Fused with the invading army, so\nyou don’t have enemy Invested to worry about. Plus, you have the Oathgate\nsurrounded by that metal dome, right?”\n“Yes,” Yanagawn said. “But despite that, I’m afraid. They have five\ntimes our number of troops!”\n“A fortification like that can be an excellent force multiplier,” the Mink\nsaid. “But the average singer troop is stronger than a human one, with their\nwarform armor. It will be a tight defense.”\n“Normally, striking directly at Azimir would be suicide,” Dalinar said,\nstepping up beside the Mink. “And taking it wouldn’t mean anything—it’s\nin the heart of the empire. You can’t expect success in an extended\ncampaign if you’re surrounded. But this isn’t an extended campaign. They\njust have to seize Azimir and hold it for a few days.”\n“You are right,” the Mink said, standing with his head peeking up\nthrough the illusory map. As if he were swimming. “This is an entire\nempire. You, Azish word people. What happens to your empire if Azir is\nconquered?”\nThe viziers conferred, then went to talk to Wit. Navani tapped her fingers\ntogether in thought, and didn’t miss how several in the room—\nrepresentatives of Emul, Yezier, Desh—murmured at this. All three were\nsmaller kingdoms that were part of the complex Azish imperial state. They\nwere autonomous in all but name: never overtly rejecting Azir’s claims of\ndominance, but also not paying tax to the central kingdom, except\noccasional support for armies keeping the peace.\nIt had worked for centuries. The smaller kingdoms gained increased\npolitical clout and Azir was able to pretend it was in charge. The lesser\nprimes deferred to the emperor in social matters, and Azish armies lent aid\nto nearby disputes.\nNo one said the quiet part: that there was no empire. Only a group of\nethnically connected kingdoms who role-played as one.\nExcept now.\n“Unfortunately,” Noura said, with Wit looking sour behind her, “if\nAzimir falls, they all fall. An entire empire, captured in one bold move.”\n“We can’t risk that,” Adolin said, stepping into the center of Shinovar.\n“What we can and cannot risk,” the Mink said, “depends on the troops.\nDalinar, how many can you reasonably provide in time?”\n“Honestly?” Dalinar said. “Maybe twenty thousand.”\n“I need those troops,” Fen said. “Thaylen City will fall without them.”\nShe glanced to Yanagawn. “I’m sorry, Your Excellency, but you have\nreinforcements only a few days’ march from your door—and an excellent\nfortification with which to resist in the interim. My situation is far more\ndire.”"

        "text": "reinforcements only a few days’ march from your door—and an excellent\nfortification with which to resist in the interim. My situation is far more\ndire.”\n“What exactly are your defenses?” Jasnah asked, still seated, taking\nnotes for herself quietly.\n“We have a skeleton of a navy left,” Fen explained. “Our ground forces\n—such as they were—mostly fell at the Battle of Thaylen Field. Frankly,\nwe’re dependent on you for our defense now. As you all well know.”\n“We are establishing our situation, not trying to goad you,” Jasnah said.\n“Let us look at the third point of attack,” the Mink said. “The Shattered\nPlains. These are well defended, no?”\n“Very well defended,” Dalinar said. “But I hate pitting conventional\ntroops against Fused.”\n“If we lose the Shattered Plains,” Jasnah said, “we lose our last foothold\nin eastern Roshar.”\n“Three vital points of defense,” the Mink said, appearing tiny beside\nDalinar. “And our military is strung out, blanketing hundreds of miles of\nborderlands. This isn’t good, Dalinar.”\nNavani had read a lot of books on tactics out loud to her husbands, so\nshe tried to figure out what Dalinar and the Mink would decide. Throw\neverything at Azir, perhaps? It had the fewest troops, and its Oathgate\nwould soon stop functioning for the coalition forces. At Thaylenah, the\nenemy would need to perform an ocean assault and then break through the\ncity walls. They’d done both during the Battle of Thaylen Field, but they\nwould have a much harder time accomplishing that now, with the coalition\nready for them. The same went for the Shattered Plains: Navani knew\nfirsthand how difficult that territory was to crack.\nBut Azimir? With enemies flooding out of the Oathgate in the center of\nthe city, mere yards from the palace? She thought Dalinar would put most\nof their forces there.\nDalinar and the Mink shared a glance. And from their expressions,\nNavani knew she was missing something. What?\n“I see your concern, Uncle,” Jasnah said from her seat, Wit just behind\nher, one hand on the back of her chair. “What is it?”\n“We have limited troops we can mobilize on such short notice,” Dalinar\nsaid. “If we spread ourselves too thin, we lose everything.”\n“We have to assume the forty thousand coming to Azimir will be\nenough,” Jasnah said, seeming proud that she’d figured it out. “Because if\nwe commit more troops there, they’ll be locked away behind a\nnonfunctional Oathgate. A fate the forty thousand will already suffer. So we\nsend only a few thousand to hold out there, and split the bulk of our forces\nacross the other two fronts.”\n“Yes,” the Mink said, sounding reluctant. “That is the best plan. A\nskeleton force to Azimir. The bulk of our conventional troops to Thaylen\nCity to hold the walls—which are useless without troops on them.”\nYanagawn stood up from his throne. “This leaves us alone! Least\ndefended! Abandoned!”\n“Your Excellency,” Dalinar said, turning, “we’re not abandoning you.\nWe’re not making decisions right now, merely working through our options."

Abandoned!”\n“Your Excellency,” Dalinar said, turning, “we’re not abandoning you.\nWe’re not making decisions right now, merely working through our options.\nBut the truth is, you have that excellent fortification surrounding the\nOathgate, and you have forty thousand friendly troops on your doorstep.\nAlong with all of the Radiants who were fighting alongside them.”\n“We walk a delicate line,” the Mink said. “If we overcommit to Azir,\nwhich will soon have far more troops than it needs anyway, we’ll lose\neverything else. We must do all we can to hasten the force already on its\nway to Azimir, and not leave everything else undefended. Navani, how\nconfident are you in the tower’s natural defenses?”\nSibling? she asked.\nThe lights in the room dimmed. A glowing column of light appeared\nfrom a glass disc in the ceiling, extending to a matching one below. The\nSibling’s voice spoke to all of them. “They will not come here. Fused will\nfall unconscious. Regals will have their forms stripped from them. Even\ncommon singers will lose access to their rhythms, and my beats can drive\nthem mad. They know that. Now that I’ve returned, they know.”\nThe room stilled. Well, that seemed a step forward. Only a few days ago,\nthe Sibling would barely speak to Navani.\n“That sounds conclusive,” the Mink said. “So, Dalinar, we can empty\nUrithiru of your twenty thousand and send the bulk of them to shore up\nThaylenah. We cannot lose the island—if we do, we will give up the seas\nentirely. The Shattered Plains might be able to handle themselves. We can\npull in some outlying forces, centralize at Narak.”\n“Pardon,” Sigzil said, “but the scout reports are frank. The fight at the\nShattered Plains will face thunderclasts, Heavenly Ones, Deepest Ones, and\nmore. That’s suicide for conventional troops without support.”\n“He’s right,” Dalinar said. “We’ll need our Radiants there—to counter\ntheir Invested.”\n“And Azir?” Yanagawn said from where he stood. “We defend\nThaylenah and the Shattered Plains, but what do we send to my homeland?\nYou mentioned at least a skeleton force to help me hold until the army\narrives?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, rubbing his chin. “I think your fight is the most\nwinnable. That dome fortification is incredible.”\n“I disagree,” the Mink said. “The defense will be more difficult than you\nthink, Dalinar. The dome will offer a clear killing field, but singer forces are\nwell armored, good versus arrows. If you were defending against humans,\nyou could hold it easily. Against singers?” He shook his head.\n“Yes, but a small number of troops should be able to hold a few days,”\nDalinar said, gesturing toward Azimir on the map. “We must send the bulk\nof our troops to Thaylen City to man the walls, but what if we sent the best\nof our troops to that dome?”\n“I don’t know,” the Mink said. “One misstep, and that dome will fill with\nenemies like a boil on a finger, waiting to pop.

Then they’ll flood into the\nvery heart of the city. No, I wouldn’t want to try to hold that. It could be a\nwaste. We maybe should send nobody, evacuate, and then let the returning\narmy of forty thousand reclaim Azimir once they arrive.”\n“That’s too much of a risk,” Yanagawn said. “What if it were your\nhomeland, Dieno?”\nThe Mink looked up. Then took a deep breath and nodded. “Yes, you are\nright. Of course you are right. I’m sorry—sometimes a love of tactics\novershadows the heart. We must do what we can. Our best, then, to Azir.\nEnough to hold, but not so much to weaken other fronts. But who will lead\nthem?”\nA beat, the room quiet. Navani held her breath.\n“I’ll go,” Adolin said, stepping into the illusion. “Father, let me recruit\ntwo thousand. I’ll ask for volunteers for what might be a difficult fight, and\ngather the best of them. With them and the Cobalt Guard, I’ll go to Azir and\nhold that city until reinforcements arrive.”\nDalinar glanced at Navani; the Mink’s words seemed to have unnerved\nhim. “What of the other two battlefronts,” he said at last. “Who leads those\narmies? I will need to prepare for my contest, and I suspect I won’t be\navailable.”\n“I’m no general,” Fen said. “And Kmakl is a navy man. I’d like some\ngenerals with ground force experience.”\n“What about me?” Jasnah said, finally rising. “I’ve fought in Thaylen\nCity before. I could go, bring generals to determine our strategy, and take\ncommand of the twenty thousand there.”\nNavani held her tongue. Jasnah had been eager for chances to prove\nherself as a tactician—as if she didn’t have enough to occupy her mind.\nStill, Jasnah was perhaps the most dangerous Radiant they had.\n“A good choice,” Dalinar said. “Fen, what do you think?”\n“We’d welcome the queen,” Fen said. “Especially if I can get\nStonewards to seal up breaches in the wall, should it get knocked down\nagain.”\n“We have a few,” Dalinar said, likely doing the mental math. They didn’t\nhave as many Stonewards as they did Edgedancers and Windrunners, and\nmost were already in the group marching for Azimir. “I can send those,\nalong with some Edgedancers to heal the wounded.”\n“Excellent,” Jasnah said, settling back down. “I’ll begin forming a\nstrategy, and discuss it with our generals.”\n“Windrunner Sigzil,” Dalinar said. “You take command of the Shattered\nPlains.”\n“… Sir?” Sigzil said.\n“We’ll want a Radiant in command there. I’ll send the Stormwall to back\nyou up, and you can rely on our generals for tactics. But the Windrunners\nare our largest and most decorated group of Radiant soldiers. You should\nlead.”\n“Sir,” Sigzil said, saluting."

He was\ntrained in warfare by the Blackthorn himself. I’m certain my generals\nwould welcome his aid.”\nNavani wasn’t so certain. She’d seen how jealous soldiers could get\nwhen someone outside their command structure showed up and took\ncharge, but she held her tongue.\n“Father,” Adolin said, “the enemy at Azimir won’t have many Fused. In\nShadesmar I saw some Heavenly Ones, but mostly ships full of common\nsoldiers. We can contain them. Let me go.”\nDalinar towered over the center of the map. Eventually he nodded. “A\ngood plan. You may go, son. And you may recruit up to two thousand of our\nbest, as you wish.”\n“Excellent,” Adolin said.\n“Thank you!” Yanagawn said. “We should start now! We cannot waste\ntime!”\n“The next few hours will be critical,” Dalinar said. “If the monarchs are\nagreed, we can break this meeting for now—though send your generals in\nto speak with the Mink and me. We will spend the next few hours going\nover strategy for each battlefield in detail.”\nImmediately the Azish contingent started moving, picking up their seats.\nAdolin started to join them, then hesitated at the edge of the map.\nHe and Dalinar locked gazes. Just go hug him, Navani thought, stepping\nup to Dalinar and putting her hand to the small of his back. Wish him the\nbest. Tell him you believe in him.\nNeither spoke. Then Adolin spun on his heel and hurried toward the\ndoor. Navani sighed.\n“What?” Dalinar said to her. “He wants little to do with me these days,\nNavani. It’s best I let him go.”\n“He needs his father,” Navani said. “Regardless of what he wants.\nYou’re simply going to let him walk out?”\n“We don’t have time for his drama, Navani,” Dalinar said. “Whatever I\ndo, it won’t be good enough for him. I fear if I ask him for something, he’ll\ndo the opposite. I …”\nHe trailed off as he noticed that Adolin had stopped by the door. To\nNavani’s delight, he turned around and came back. “Father,” he said\nreluctantly, “Shallan sent me with a message you need to hear.”\nNavani felt her eyes widen as Adolin gave a brief—far too brief, for her\ntaste—recounting of some things Shallan had told him.

But storms, they were going to work it out\neventually themselves.\n“You’re supposed to be above gibes like that, son,” Dalinar said softly. “I\nraised you to be better.”\n“Raised me?” Adolin said. Angerspren pooled like blood at his feet—one\nof the few varieties of spren that ignored her orders. “You didn’t raise me,\nFather. You killed the woman who did.”\nDalinar winced. “This isn’t the time.”\n“It could be,” Navani said, wanting to grab them both by the arms and\ntow them off to talk until they worked it out.\n“No,” Adolin agreed. “Not right now. Father, I want you to authorize\nShallan’s strike. Time is of the essence. Please.”\nDalinar sighed, then nodded. “We’ll reach out to her for what she needs.”\nStorms, they seemed so close. Finally, Dalinar opened his mouth. Her\nheart leaped, expecting the apology. Instead it was a gruff, “You might need\nhelp with the Azish. You don’t speak their language.”\n“I can get an interpreter.”\n“I can do better,” Dalinar said, taking him by the shoulder. Stormlight\nstreamed off Dalinar. “I can give you a Bondsmithing to help. It won’t work\nanywhere but in Azir, but while you’re there, it will let you understand\nthem. It should last a few weeks.”\nAdolin grunted. They stared one another in the eyes. Then, Adolin\nnodded and left without another word.\nNavani sighed, her heart bleeding for them.\n“Why?” she asked Dalinar. “Why don’t you say more?”\n“He always throws it back at me,” Dalinar said, his thumb and forefinger\nmassaging his forehead. “And in a way, he’s right, Navani. I didn’t raise\nhim. He was always just … so perfect, all on his own. Or with Evi’s help, I\nsuppose. I now realize I never did anything other than order him around.”\n“And letting it fester will make it better?”\n“I don’t know,” he admitted. “But this really isn’t the time. I’ve got a\nstrategy meeting I need to lead. After that, though, I need to tell you about\nsomething even more important.” He seemed concerned. “I need your"

That of Jasnah and Wit too, maybe Fen.”\nShe frowned. “What is this?”\n“On the way to the meeting today,” Dalinar said, his expression distant,\n“I encountered a god …”\nFirst, I dared not tell them this dusty traveler with whom they\nshared a meal was in fact that very king they had heard of. The\nsecond was that I did not explain that very king had abdicated his\nthrone and walked away from his kingdom.\n—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable\nShallan and her team—the best she had, without Vathah and Ishnah, who\nwere still in Shadesmar—spent the next few hours planning. Then it was\nfinally time.\nHer team of five made their way to an Oathgate outside Urithiru, hiding\namong a larger group of soldiers being transferred to Narak to reinforce it.\nShe led with outward confidence, though deeper inside she acknowledged\nshe was terrified. Mraize and Iyatil had manipulated her before. They had a\nnearly supernatural understanding of politics on Roshar—including the\npolitics between gods.\nWhere other groups had made bids for kingdoms, the Ghostbloods made\nbids for worlds—or for control of economic forces as big as those worlds.\nThis was what terrified Shallan. Not the things that she worried they’d do.\nThe things she was too ignorant to worry they’d do.\nThese thoughts haunted her, accompanied by anxietyspren, as light\nflashed around them and they transferred to Narak—the city at the center of\nthe Shattered Plains. It had been a year and a half since Dalinar’s fateful\nexpedition and the events that had summoned the Everstorm. Since then,\nNarak had become a fortress. With Stonewards, they’d expanded the\nOathgate platform a good ten feet. Then it and each of the central cluster of\nplateaus had been turned into a defensive bastion lined by Soulcast walls,\nattended by troops in towers.\nA lighteyed captain shouted at them to get moving, seeing Shallan and\nthe other four as just another squad of spearmen. They hiked off the\nOathgate platform with the others, entering the new ring of ground around\nthe plateau where people could wait their turn to transfer. Here Shallan and\nher team broke off, heads up, acting like they belonged. They crossed the\nbridge to Narak Four, a nearby plateau that had its own towering circular\nwall.\n“Looks like a chouta roll,” Red said from behind her.\n“What are you on about?” Gaz said.\n“The walls around these plateaus,” he said. “Makes them look like a\nbunch of chouta rolls. You know, open at the top? Stuffed with meat.”\n“And we’re the meat?” Darcira asked, her voice masked by a\nLightweaving to sound masculine.\n“Sure,” Red said.\n“They’re too stocky to look like chouta,” Darcira said. “More like\nshalebark ridges. Oh! Tree stumps, where the center has rotted out.”\n“Or, you know,” Gaz grumbled, “like the warcamps. Where we lived for\nyears?”\n“Oh, yeah!” Red said."

Where we lived for\nyears?”\n“Oh, yeah!” Red said.\n“Circular walls,” Darcira said, “soldiers everywhere … Nah, don’t see\nit.”\n“You two are buffoons,” Gaz said. “I should have stayed a storming\ndeserter. At least out in the wilds, everyone was too depressed to make\nsmall talk.”\nShallan hushed them as they reached the end of the bridge, where they\npresented falsified orders to the sergeant and scribe on watch at the gate.\nDarcira had waved them into existence on a sheet, a perfect replica. Though\nShallan, via Adolin, had permission from the Bondsmiths, she wasn’t going\nto trust anyone she didn’t need to. Anyone here could be in Ghostblood\nemploy.\nThe sergeant waved Shallan and her group through, and they entered\nNarak Four: a distinctive plateau covered in ancient buildings once so\nenveloped in crem that they’d looked like smooth mounds. A little creative\napplication of Shardblades had unearthed the original stone buildings,\nproviding room for barracks and a small marketplace, carefully regulated by\nNavani and the military.\nShallan and her team made a show—for the sergeant idly watching by\nthe gates—of walking to their assigned barrack. They came out on the other\nside wearing the faces and clothing of crem scrapers: the easy-to-ignore,\nlowly workers that kept a place like this clean. As they moved into position,\nthey were joined by Jayn—a Riran woman whom Shallan had recruited to\nthe Unseen Court eight months ago. She’d been sent ahead to watch the\nGhostblood hideout.\n“They’re continuing to gather, Brightness,” Jayn said softly, also\ndisguised as a crem scraper. “I’ve seen five or six people enter the building\nover the last half hour.”\nShallan nodded. Reports said someone was at the doorway, using black\nsand to check everyone who entered. That made Lightweaving tricky, as the\nsand could reveal uses of Radiant powers.\nTo maintain their disguises, her team began leveling a patch of road near\nthe hideout with chisels, removing the crem, plants, and lichens that grew\non the stone. Gaz used posts with string between to section off their\nworking area, diverting foot traffic, letting them chat without worrying\nabout being overheard.\nShallan took the role of foreman, walking around, checking on the other\nfive as they worked. In reality she watched that hideout, a supposed\nstorehouse of no importance. Two more people arrived, including a shorter\nuniformed Alethi man she recognized from Hoid’s sketches. The second\nwas a member of the Azish Prime’s retinue—a vizier even, though not one\nof the very important ones like Noura. Shallan took a Memory of him, so\nshe could add a drawing of the man to their stack.\nMraize had rarely let Shallan meet anyone but him, isolating her from\nwhat was proving to be a distressingly large network, including people\namong most of the major political organizations on Roshar. The best she\nknew, their primary goal was to find a way to begin shipping Stormlight\noffworld, but that—though likely a potential source of great riches—"

The best she\nknew, their primary goal was to find a way to begin shipping Stormlight\noffworld, but that—though likely a potential source of great riches—\nseemed too small-scale for Mraize and Iyatil.\nThe front door of the hideout had a sheltered porch, with a dark shadow\njust inside. When each new Ghostblood arrived at the door, a short, cloaked\nfigure stepped from the shadows and inspected them. Shallan caught a hint\nof a painted wooden mask, and the shape of the figure looked female. That\nconfirmed Darcira’s observations: it was either Iyatil or, more likely, the\nwoman among the other two.\nThe door guard inspected each of the two newcomers by touching their\nfaces to check for discrepancies in their features. Then they held up a jar of\nblack sand.\nShallan huddled with Darcira, Gaz, Red, and Jayn as they labored. They\npretended to be working on a particularly stubborn section of ground\ntogether while Jeneh kept watch. Their spren had instructions to ride on the\ninsides of clothing to remain hidden.\n“All right,” Shallan said. “This is our last chance to back out.”\n“This won’t be like infiltrating the Sons of Honor,” Gaz added. “That\ngroup was already dying when we put them down. This might be the most\ndangerous organization on the planet. I … worry we should go to ground,\nhide from them. Wait out the coming storm. I’m not sure we’re ready.”\n“What do the rest of you think?” Shallan asked.\n“I think,” Red said, “that nobody ever feels ready for big operations.\nStorms, you think half those boys on the walls feel ready to fight a war?\nThe question isn’t if we’re ready, but if it needs to be done.”\nGaz grunted. “That’s true, I suppose. Red, you need to stop saying things\nthat are smart. You’ll upend my entire opinion of you.”\nRed smiled, continuing to work with his chisel, scraping away crem. He\nhad experience with tools like this, having trained as a craftsman during his\nyouth.\n“I think our plan is good,” Darcira said. “I say we move forward.” She\nwas an unusual one, a scientist who had shown talent for Lightweaving and\nleft the ardents to join Shallan. She was the only one in the Court who\ntended to draw logicspren as often as creationspren.\n“I’m worried about how many people are in there,” Jayn said. “Shallan,\nyou will be completely outnumbered. Do we really need to do this?”\n“In just over eight days,” Shallan said softly, “Dalinar Kholin will fight\nthe champion of Odium to decide the fate of the world. The Ghostbloods,\nbest we can determine, are the most dangerous secret political force on the\nplanet. So …”\n“They’re going to be involved somehow,” Red said. “They’ll have some\nplan to compromise the contest. I’m in.” His spren hummed from where he\nrode on the inside of Red’s jacket. Array didn’t say much, and as far as\nShallan had been able to tell, he didn’t hum when he tasted lies—he seemed\nto like alliteration of all things."

So long as they have a monopoly on information, they will control us.\nAnd if we’re always reacting to them, never attacking, they will beat us.”\nShe paused, some of Mraize’s own words returning to her memory. “Prey\ncan only ever run. It can survive, but it can never win. Not so long as the\npredator lives.”\n“Sure,” Gaz said, “but we could just send the Radiant strike team in. I\nhate relying on Windrunners for anything other than transportation—and\nthen they still usually find a way to squeeze in a lecture or two. But … we\ncould defer to them this time, Shallan.”\n“We will use them,” Shallan said. “But Gaz, if we bring in soldiers first,\nthen my gut says Mraize and Iyatil will find a way to escape. Even if they\ndon’t, they’ll never talk. We could throw them in prison for a decade, and\nthose two would keep their silence. I need to know what they’re planning. I\nneed to get into that meeting.”\nShe’d learned some of what she hungered for, yes. Kelek, and her own\nrecovered memories, gave her pieces—but there was so much more.\nWorlds’ worth. She thirsted for the chance to at least once hear them talking\nfreely.\nBeyond that … they were planning something. Why was that woman\nspying on Dalinar? Why did they want Ba-Ado-Mishram? Would bursting\nin with swords out and powers ablaze stop their plans? Maybe. Maybe not.\nIt depended on what pieces were already in motion.\n“Storm it,” Gaz said. “You’re right. I’m in.”\nGaz and Red were among her oldest friends, and among their most\nexperienced Lightweavers. She knew Gaz well enough to tell his objections\nwere real—he was concerned about this mission. But he also was objecting\nin part so that the concerns could be voiced, then overcome.\n“I’m in too,” Jayn said. “Though the real danger is to you, Brightness.”\n“I can handle it,” Radiant said. “We are a go, then. Hopefully they\nhaven’t started discussing anything important.”\nHer team had talked about this. The Ghostbloods couldn’t bring\neveryone over through the Oathgates at once. A group would draw too\nmuch attention, and since the attendees were still trickling in, she hoped\nMraize was still waiting.\nDarcira covertly checked her clock—which, like many scholars, she\nwore on one of Navani’s arm bracer fabrials. “The next Oathgate transfer is\na bit over a half hour from now, and our surveillance spotted a few\nimportant members of the Ghostbloods—at least ones that Wit thought were\nimportant—hanging out in the grand entryway of Urithiru, as if waiting\ntheir turn. They’re likely to be in that next batch, which gives us just\nenough time to set up phase two.”"

They’re likely to be in that next batch, which gives us just\nenough time to set up phase two.”\n“Let’s work for a few minutes longer,” Gaz suggested. “Else it’s\nsuspicious we set up here.”\nShallan nodded in agreement, and started to actually scrape. It was\nsurprisingly hard work—but she did get a particularly defiant rockbud free,\nforcing her chisel underneath and finally prying it loose. A low rain had\nstarted to mist the air, though after the highstorm last night, the next\nwouldn’t be due for a few days. Weather had been odd since the coming of\nthe Everstorm, and rain like this was more common.\nPattern hummed softly from within her jacket, though she couldn’t tell\nwhy. This next part would be difficult. She’d never heard of that strange\nblack sand before their planning meeting earlier, but apparently it had been\nused to spot hidden spren toward the end of Urithiru’s occupation.\nWhether the sand was in jars with guards, or sprinkled along the inside\nof windowsills, it would change color if any intelligent spren came near.\nLesser spren apparently weren’t noticeable, but Cryptics absolutely would\nbe. Worse, it revealed Lightweavings.\nShallan wasn’t terribly surprised—she’d seen Wit use something similar\nonce, and had always wondered at the mechanics. Unfortunately, it meant\nshe had to do the hardest part without her powers or her spren.\n“Time to move, then,” Shallan said, standing. “Let’s go.”\nSigzil did his best to pretend he was Kaladin.\nHe stood tall during the long strategy meeting that followed the initial\ndiscussion of the monarchs, and he tried to act like he understood more than\nhe did. Kaladin was always so sure of himself. He always knew the next\nstep to take.\nSigzil couldn’t do that, but he could pretend enough to keep the\nanxietyspren away. Act like he belonged among monarchs, generals, and the\nstorming Prime Aqasix of the Azish Empire.\nSigzil’s mother would laugh at him; he read the amusement in her letters.\nHim? A military man? Her studious little boy, so delicate and refined? Even\nin Azir, he’d been made fun of for his persnickety ways. Yet here he was,\nshoulder to shoulder with a group of generals.\n“Someone,” he whispered to himself, “is going to eventually discover\nI’m a fraud, won’t they?”\n“You’re not a fraud,” Vienta, his spren, whispered to him—remaining\ninvisible, as she often did.\n“I’m a failed scholar, a mediocre Worldsinger, and a persnickety\nperfectionist who drives the others up the wall. I …”\n“Did you survive Bridge Four?”\n“Yes,” he whispered. “Through pain and storm, I survived.”\n“Then you can survive this.”\n“But to lead them?” he asked.\n“What do you think,” she said softly, “was the result of that pain and\nfire? You are a leader now, Sigzil. You are a hero. Live that truth.”\nAs the meeting moved toward a break, Sigzil found himself standing"

Live that truth.”\nAs the meeting moved toward a break, Sigzil found himself standing\nwith Kmakl, the Thaylen prince consort, at the edge of the large glowing\nmap.\n“What I don’t get,” Kmakl was saying to Ka, the Windrunner scribe, “is\nwhere their troops came from.”\nAcross the room, Brightlord Dalinar, Brightness Navani, Queen Jasnah,\nand Queen Fen retreated to a smaller chamber to discuss something\nsensitive. The Azish Prime had left a short time before, to return to his city.\nHe wasn’t generally involved in detailed battle plans.\n“Their troops get reborn,” Ka said, poring over the scout reports. She\nmade notations with her silver pen, one of the most interesting uses of a\nShardblade among the Windrunners to date. It had a cartridge to fill with\nink and everything. She chose to wear a blue havah embroidered with the\nBridge Four symbol on the shoulder, one of the new uniforms Kaladin had\nauthorized.\nThere was an Azish-inspired one as well, which Sigzil could have worn.\nTheir most recent recruits were from all across Roshar, and Sigzil himself\nhad made the point that the Windrunners shouldn’t be perceived as an\nAlethi group. So why didn’t he wear that instead of the uniform he’d been\ngiven all those months ago? Was it because of the tattoo on his forehead?\nBridge Four was the only place I ever felt like a person rather than an\naccident, he thought. But without Kaladin, Rock, Teft, Moash … was it\nreally Bridge Four anymore? All he wanted was to be back at that fire,\nsitting with his friends and listening to Rock gently make fun of him for\ncounting the chunks of meat in bowls of stew to make sure everyone was\ngetting proper nutrition.\n“Brightlord?” Kmakl asked him. “Is everything all right?”\n“Yes,” Sigzil said, clasping his hands behind his back, forcing his\nattention onto the logistics. “You were saying they have too many troops? I\nthink Ka is correct. Their Fused can be reborn; they’ll always have more\ntroops than we do.”\n“True, true,” Kmakl said. “But with the number of Fused marching on\nthe Shattered Plains, those troop transports coming for Thaylen City will be\nfilled with ordinary singers. They’ll be thrown at our battle lines like bait to\nbe caught in our nets. Poor souls. They have to be running out of frontline\nsoldiers, don’t they?”\n“Apparently not,” Ka said. “How do we distribute our Windrunners?\nSigzil?”\n“Thaylen City will need at least one squad, maybe an entire company,”\nSigzil said. “The enemy will probably move some Skybreakers to the\nShattered Plains, now that the blockade is broken, but an air force will\nguard those troop transports during the crossing. So we should be ready to\nmatch them once they reach Thaylen City, to not cede air superiority.”\nHe wished they had more variety to their Radiant forces. Yes, they had\nWindrunners and Edgedancers aplenty, and a growing force of Stonewards\nand Lightweavers. The other orders were largely empty though."

We’ll burn the docks and lay hull-\nrippers in the shallows. When they land, we go back to the walls.”\n“They smashed those open with thunderclasts last time,” Ka noted. “But\nI have an idea. We could assign our Windrunners to another battlefield until\nthe enemy arrives at yours—forcing them to waste Skybreakers guarding\ntheir ships for days.”\n“A clever idea,” Kmakl said. “With Oathgates at both the Shattered\nPlains and Thaylen City, we can transfer troops between battlefields as\nnecessary.” He glanced up, toward where the Azish contingent had been\nearlier.\nConsidering, perhaps, Sigzil thought, what the Mink said. About Azimir\nbeing a tougher defense than it looked. It would be the only one of the three\nunable to receive support from the other battlefields, as its Oathgate would\nsoon cease functioning. At least they’d have an entire army arriving to help\nin a few days.\nSigzil had to worry about stretching his Windrunners too thin. The battle\nat the Shattered Plains was going to be a strange one, full of so many Fused.\nAnd somehow he had to lead that defense.\n“We can use the Oathgates,” Ka noted, “but we will want to be very\ncareful with them. We’ve had one too many instances of ‘Wait, how’d these\npesky enemy forces get here in the squishy part of my rear lines?’ I think\nwe should assign some people to keep talking to each Oathgate spren, to\nhopefully prevent any other defections. What do you think, Sigzil?”\nWhat did he think? He glanced at her, and heard his spren’s words\nechoing in his mind.\nLive that truth.\nStorm him, it was time to stop being unsure of himself, wasn’t it? It was\ntime to stop fidgeting. He’d been put in command.\nHe needed to act like it.\n“I think you’re right,” he said. “And also … Ka, I have an idea about the\ndefense of Narak. Where I’m in command. It’s a strange one, but I think it\nmight work.”\n“Excellent,” Ka said. “If so, we should run it past the Mink.”\nKmakl scanned the room. “I have some questions to ask him too.

The little man had vanished yet again.\nJasnah—with Dalinar, Navani, and Fen—entered a room full of plants and\nbobbing lifespren.\nIt had once been an ordinary room, but upon the Sibling’s awakening, it\nhad transformed. The stone of the ceiling looked transparent, replicating the\nsun—making you feel like you were standing beneath a skylight.

I thought the stories fancies.”\n“This is growing into something of a mess,” Dalinar said from the center\nof the room, where vines were curling around his legs. “Can we ask the\nSibling to tone it down?”\n“They’d rather not,” Navani said.\nThe room vibrated, and a quiet voice echoed from the air vents near the\nfloor. “It is a room for my sister, should she visit. A room for the\nNightwatcher.”\n“Very well,” Dalinar said, with his firmest voice. His you really should\nlisten to me and do as I say, but I’ll pretend you doing otherwise doesn’t\nbother me voice. “We appreciate your willingness to make the tower\nfunction.”\n“I did not have much choice in the matter,” the Sibling said. “But I did\nhave some. So you are welcome.”\nQueen Fen took a chair from those piled near some tables on the far side,\npulling it free of the foliage. They’d used this smaller chamber off the\nmeeting room for storage. Jasnah stepped softly, trying to imagine the\nNightwatcher visiting, enjoying the abundance of life. Had it ever\nhappened? The Sibling and the tower had shut down just before the\nRecreance, over two thousand years ago.\n“When was the Nightwatcher created?” Jasnah whispered to Ivory. “We\ncall her the Old Magic, but how long has she been around? When did\nCultivation form her?”\nBefore Ivory could answer, a voice whispered back from a nearby air\nvent. “The Nightwatcher came from the Night, as the Stormfather came\nfrom the Wind. Though, when I was young, the Wind was different. So very\ndifferent.”\n“When were you created, Sibling?” Jasnah asked.\n“Some six thousand years ago, when the Stones wanted a legacy in the\nform of a child of Honor and Cultivation. Back when Bondsmiths bonded\nnot to spren, but to the ancient forces, left by gods.”\n“And the Stormfather?”\n“Soon before me.”\n“That’s inaccurate though,” Jasnah said. “Dalinar speaks of the\nStormfather having existed when people first came to Roshar, seven\nthousand years ago. The Stormfather remembers that event, and detailed the\ntiming.”\n“It has been confusing,” the Sibling said, “to learn of all that has\nhappened while I slept. I knew the Stormfather when he was young. I,\nformed from the Stone, which was the sibling of Wind and Night. The\nNight left.

First, though, her uncle had something he wanted to\nsay. She and Navani turned to Dalinar, in the center of the room, who had\nhis eyes closed. It looked as if he were hovering beneath a sea of lights,\ngrass rippling around his feet.\n“Uncle?” Jasnah asked.\n“I am not ready,” he said, opening his eyes, “to fight Odium.”\n“I don’t know what preparation we can make, given the deadline,”\nNavani said. “A deadline you agreed to.”\n“Yes. I did.” He seized a chair from a stack beside some tables draped in\ntablecloths, the whole pile shifting as he jerked it free, and Jasnah heard a\ndistinctive eep from them. They weren’t alone.\nOf course they weren’t. That girl seemed able to wiggle in anywhere.\nJasnah glanced into Shadesmar, and saw Lift there—manifesting as a\nglowing light like a candle’s flame. Alongside someone else. Curious.\n“Even when I agreed to the contract,” Dalinar said, setting the chair\ndown for Navani, then fetching another, “I was uncertain, but the chance\nwas too valuable to pass up. Now that I’ve seen one of my mistakes—not\npreventing this assault—I fear there are more, regardless of what Wit says.”\n“What is it I say?” Wit said, slipping into the room, carrying snacks.\nThat was why he’d sneaked off, delaying them? Really? He handed her a\nplate of fruit. “I hope whatever it is that you said that I said, it was either\nnasty or clever. Or both. I honestly prefer both.”\n“I am worried Odium will outmaneuver me,” Dalinar replied. He\nglanced at Jasnah and nodded toward the seats, with a question in his eyes.\nShe nodded back, so he fetched her one.\nCurious, how he’d changed. She’d read of times when he wouldn’t have\nworried about anyone else. She’d known him throughout her adulthood as\nthe man who would take care of people even when they didn’t want it. Now,\nfor the first time she could remember, he asked if she wanted his help.\nBecause he knew that sometimes she disliked it when people did things for\nher that she would rather have done for herself.\nShe took her seat. Fen pulled over her chair, and Wit placed a small table\nand arranged food on it in an artistic way, because of course he did. Jasnah\nrealized, absently, that she was hungry. They’d all likely forgotten breakfast\nin the chaos.\nOnce in a while, it was nice to have someone take care of you. She didn’t\nblame others for getting confused about what she wanted; she regularly\nconfused herself. So today, she enjoyed the plate of fruit.\nWit brought over a chair and spun it around the wrong way before\nsettling down among them. When in public, he acted the proper Wit,"

        "text": "confused herself. So today, she enjoyed the plate of fruit.\nWit brought over a chair and spun it around the wrong way before\nsettling down among them. When in public, he acted the proper Wit,\nstanding behind her chair, deferring to her. In a setting like this … well,\nwhatever he was, it was above a queen or a highprince. He didn’t need to\nsay it: he could sit among them. They all knew it by now, including Fen,\nwho looked at him the way one might at an eel that could strike at any\nmoment.\n“You are wise to be worried,” Wit said to Dalinar. “I am troubled by this\nnew Odium. The power will remember me and hate me, no matter who is at\nthe helm—but the new Vessel stole several of my memories, then let me\nassume that I’d bested them. This tells us a little of their personality. Not\ngloating, though the power would probably have enjoyed that.”\n“The power … can think?” Jasnah asked.\n“Yes,” Wit said. “Ask your spren what happens if fragments of a god are\nleft to their own devices for too long. They stand up, start walking about,\nand start riding around in people’s earrings. They start caring.\n“Each ‘god’ is a slice of a greater entity killed some ten thousand years\nago, its power divided. Those fragments have Identities, Intents. Honor: the\ninstinct to make bonds and keep them. Odium: a god’s divine wrath,\nuncoupled from essential moderating factors like mercy and love.”\n“I met another one earlier,” Dalinar said. “On my way up here:\nCultivation appeared to me in the form of a woman.”\nJasnah came alert, palafruit halfway to her mouth. “Cultivation spoke to\nyou?” she said. “That’s why you called me in here?”\n“I believe so,” Dalinar said. “She looked the same. Sounded the same.\nFelt the same. It could be a trick of some sort, I admit, but … there was\nsomething about the meeting …”\n“And she said …” Wit prodded.\n“She told me I needed to seek the Spiritual Realm,” Dalinar said. “That I\ndidn’t need to expand my powers as a Bondsmith so much as I needed to\nexpand my understanding, particularly of the past. I cannot travel through\ntime, but I can travel the visions. I can see how the Heralds and Radiants\ndealt with Odium before. She implied I’ve been on this path for years\nwithout realizing it, and if I learn correctly, I will know how to defeat\nOdium.”\nStorms. Jasnah thought of the wonder of being able to travel to other\ntimes. She’d dedicated her whole life to studying the past as a way to\nunderstand the future. Her efforts, though successful at times, had always\nbeen uncertain. Akin to searching shadows for shapes to interpret.\nThrough Dalinar’s visions, she could see what had made those shapes. It\nwasn’t actually traveling to the past, but the possibilities offered … “Can\nyou visit any other times though? I thought the visions were more rigid than\nthat.”\n“I thought so too,” Dalinar said. “But recently I’ve found the\nStormfather’s words about them to be full of … well, not contradictions."

Cultivation implied there was much more to see and\nlearn.”\n“Everything exists in three realms,” Wit said. “Physical, where we live\nnow. Shadesmar, the Cognitive Realm, where minds project their\nimpressions. Finally, the Spiritual Realm. The realm of our souls, our links\nto our past and to other people.\n“The Spiritual Realm is a dangerous, confusing place. Every event in the\npast still echoes in there, yes, just as the scars upon the body are a record of\npast wounds. However, when you travel the visions with the Stormfather,\nDalinar, you do so in a very carefully prescribed way. To deviate from that\ncourse risks getting lost in a place with no directions, no lifelines. A place\nwhere even I, as one of the ancients, tread cautiously.”\n“Would it really be helpful?” Navani asked. “Dalinar, didn’t the\nStormfather imply that the visions can’t show you anything he doesn’t\nknow? So what could you learn?”\n“It does seem like a risk,” Fen added. “For something so nebulous.”\n“There … is more,” Dalinar said, his hands clasped before him.\n“Something else that Cultivation said. What happened to Honor, Wit? What\ntruly happened at his death?”\n“I don’t know,” Wit admitted, his voice soft, arms crossed before him on\nthe back of his chair. “I was off-planet for the event, to my eternal shame.\nOther matters drew my attention, and I let the centuries slip away from me.\nHe was erratic when I left. When I returned …” He shrugged. “Gone. The\nRadiants broken. The world in turmoil following the Recreance. I’ve been\ntrying to catch up ever since.”\n“And … do you know the location of his power?” Dalinar asked.\nWit didn’t respond immediately. He took a deep breath and cocked a\nsmile at the corner of his lips. “So. She nudged you in that direction, did\nshe?”\n“She did,” Dalinar said. “If we are to fight a god, would it not be best to\nhave one on our side?”\nWait, Jasnah thought. What is he saying?\n“I have yet to know a person,” Wit said, “who took up one of those\nShards and didn’t regret it, my friend.”\n“Same as any other burden of responsibility.”\n“Yes,” Wit said, “but orders of magnitude worse.” He looked around the\nroom, and Jasnah noted Fen watching with wide eyes. Not questioning, but\nobviously out of her league.\nThey were talking about Dalinar Ascending to the Shard of Honor.\nStorms.\n“That seems a big leap to make,” Jasnah said. “Too big a leap.”\n“I can think of nothing else to try,” Dalinar whispered.\n“What if we renegotiated the contract?” Jasnah said.\nThey all looked at her.\n“If there is a new Odium,” she said, “he might agree to different terms.\nPerhaps he will stop the war entirely if we give him accommodations.” She\ndidn’t look at Wit. “What if we let him leave?”\n“Jasnah,” Wit said, pained. “We can’t unleash him upon the cosmere.”"

        "text": "didn’t look at Wit. “What if we let him leave?”\n“Jasnah,” Wit said, pained. “We can’t unleash him upon the cosmere.”\n“We have to at least consider every option,” Jasnah said. “You said that\nthe other worlds, and the beings that rule them, are content to leave Odium\nto us. They offer no help or succor, and sometimes you have to think about\nyourself first. What if we renegotiated?”\n“No,” Dalinar said softly. “He took advantage of us once—and he’d only\nrenegotiate if it served him better. He would do so only to take further\nadvantage. I think we need to explore options outside the contract—options\nlike Honor’s power.”\nThey sat quietly at that, and Jasnah had to admit that negotiating the first\ntime hadn’t worked spectacularly. She looked to Wit, who slumped,\noffended, as he met her eyes. Keeping Odium from destroying more worlds\nwas one of his primary goals.\n“Peace,” she said, resting a hand on his arm. “I’m only asking questions,\nas I must.”\n“I understand,” he said, nodding. And he did seem to. “And what is put\nupon all of you is unfair. You have every right to be annoyed at the other\nShards. I certainly am. Dalinar, you have a good point in what you’re\ncontemplating.”\nDalinar nodded. “I worry that I need something far, far greater than what\nthis contest under any terms can offer. If you bring an army of six men\nagainst an army of tens of thousands, you’ll lose. That’s what I’m doing, in\nfacing Odium. What if there’s a better way? What if there’s a way to fight\nOdium? Defeat, destroy, exile him. Using the power of a god.”\nJasnah shivered, and forced herself to consider it. She had known, even\nwhen no one else wanted to acknowledge it, that there was nothing\nwatching or protecting them. All the aphorisms, rituals, and writings were\nfor the comfort of the people at best—or the control of them at worst. She’d\naccepted this, though at times she had dearly wished for that comfort.\nRecently, in talking with Wit, she’d discovered the extent to which she’d\nbeen right. There was something up there, it just wasn’t God. It was a group\nof ordinary people. She didn’t know what terrified her more. The idea of\nsome powerful, all-knowing deity that controlled everything—destroying\nher free will, yet for some reason still leaving the entire world in so much\npain. Or the knowledge that there were beings who ruled the cosmere with\nimmense power—but they had all the foibles, flaws, and limited morality of\nanyone else.\nAfter contemplation, giving Dalinar’s idea due thought, she still found\nherself against it. Kings were bad enough. This was far worse.\n“Dalinar,” she said, “I don’t feel comfortable with this line of\nreasoning.”\n“Neither do I,” he said. “Storms, Jasnah, neither do I. But we face a\nbeing of immense strength and intelligence. When I get to that contest in\neight days, they are going to outmaneuver me. I’m increasingly certain it\nwill happen.”"

I’m increasingly certain it\nwill happen.”\n“So you’re saying the only way to win,” Fen said, “is to face them as an\nequal? With the power of Honor?”\n“Do you know, Wit?” Dalinar asked. “What happens to the power of a\ngod when they die?”\n“It’s different on each world,” Wit said. “On one it was all around, and\nwe didn’t realize it. In another, the god’s power was stuffed in a\nmetaphorical closet—packed into Shadesmar, left to rot. Here, if it wasn’t\nSplintered after all, then it’s in the Spiritual Realm. I think it might be the\nvery substance of your visions, which behave so interestingly.”\n“Cultivation said the same,” Dalinar said. “That if I travel the Spiritual\nRealm, it will be all around me.”\n“But … isn’t it all around us already?” Navani asked. “In the spren, the\nStormlight, the power of the Radiants?”\n“Yes and no,” Wit said. “This is complicated. A Shard—a god—suffuses\neverything. Every axon on the world is, in some way, Connected to it. But\nthe Spiritual Realm must hold a core of what Honor used to be. A well of\nenergy, you might say. If you were to Connect to it in the right way, you\nwould ascend to Honor’s position. Then all the ambient power of the world\nwould be part of you. You’d need to find a way to persuade the power to\naccept you.”\n“And if I did want to do that …” Dalinar said.\nWit met his eyes. “Then yes, the Spiritual Realm is where you’d start.”\nUncharacteristically subdued, he rested his head on his folded arms.\n“Navani, did the Sibling notice the visit of a god to their tower?”\nNavani looked upward for a moment, then shook her head. “The Sibling\nsays, however, that their mother is … quiet. Sneaky.”\n“Her kind tend to be,” Wit mumbled, “for all their enormous size. Tricky\nlizards who hide where you least expect them. Like someone else I know.”\nHe took up an empty bowl, then threw it across the room toward the stacked\ntables. It hit the tablecloth covering one and smacked into something, which\nyelped.\nDalinar stood and spun, toppling his chair, alert, with yellow shockspren\nbreaking around him. A fraction of a second later, he realized who it was.\n“Lift?” he said. “Again?”\nThe head of a teenage girl popped out, with round features and long,\nstraight dark hair spilling around her face. A second head emerged beside\nhers, much older, with a grey mustache.\n“Dieno?” Dalinar said, righting his chair and sitting back down.\nThe Mink seemed embarrassed to have been caught—though as usual\nLift didn’t care. She scampered forward and helped herself to the snacks.\nThe Mink stood up and straightened his clothing.\n“You could have just asked instead of spying,” Dalinar said. “How did\nyou get in, anyway?”\n“Vents,” the Mink said. “And pardon, Blackthorn, the fatal problem with"

Jasnah watched the two, considering them. Lift had\nsignificant potential as a spy, and Jasnah had contemplated encouraging her\nin that direction. The Mink though … he was too dangerous. He acted\nsmall, unassuming, but he was not loyal to her family, and she did not\nblame him. In his place, she wouldn’t be either.\n“I’ll admit,” the Mink said, stepping up to them, “I didn’t anticipate a\ndiscussion of deification. It is … puelo arandan? The Alethi word is …”\n“Blasphemous,” Jasnah said.\n“Ah, yes,” the Mink said. “That.”\n“What did you expect to hear?” Jasnah asked, toying with a small green\npalafruit but not biting into it.\n“A discussion of whether or not to assault Alethkar,” the Mink said,\nshrugging.\n“Alethkar?” Navani said. “Why? If we win, we get it back—and your\nhomeland as well.”\n“If you lose?” the Mink asked, looking to Dalinar.\n“They keep both kingdoms,” Dalinar said.\n“If they control them,” the Mink said. “The contract loophole works both\nways, no?”\nWit cocked his head. “I suppose … yes. If we were to assault and\nreclaim Alethkar before the deadline it would be ours, regardless of the\noutcome of the contest.”\n“When you all scuttled off,” the Mink said, “I assumed you’d seen this,\nand didn’t want anyone else to get their hopes up as you discussed.”\nReclaim Alethkar? She could help her people become a nation again, not\na group of refugees. Jasnah sat up straight and looked to Dalinar, who had\nhunched forward. He met her eyes, and she saw the truth in them. Even\nbefore her own mind—scrambling to work out the logistics—did.\nIt was impossible.\nKholinar was in the very heart of Alethkar—fortified, home to thousands\nof Fused and multiple Unmade. They’d need to somehow deliver enough\ntroops to accomplish the assault, pulling them away from every other\nfortified position—and the distances involved …\nThe enemy’s assaults were in places it could reach quickly: Thaylenah\nby ship, Azimir through Shadesmar, and the Shattered Plains via a smaller\nnumber of Fused arriving by air. Reaching Alethkar on such short notice\nwould be …\nWell, it simply couldn’t be done. Not unless they pulled every\nWindrunner away, and risked everything on this one gamble.\n“The logistics of it are impossible, I’m afraid,” Dalinar said. “Kholinar is\ntoo far away and too well fortified.”\n“And Herdaz?” the Mink asked. “Barely any Fused.

Even if you were confident, I should not\nlike to trust our freedom to another man’s sword. No matter how comically\nlarge said sword may be.” He stepped closer, holding something. A tattered\nremnant of a banner, one Jasnah knew he kept in his pocket. “You are to be\ncommended for remembering Herdaz in your contract, Blackthorn. I no\nlonger think you will forget us, as the Alethi so often have.\n“But you gave me a promise. I should like it fulfilled. First Alethkar,\nthen Herdaz. If you cannot send armies for your homeland, then our\npromise comes due. I would like to try, and I should like you to keep your\noath to me. Troops. Support.”\n“Eight days?” Navani asked. “You want us to deliver troops to a nation\nhundreds of miles away in eight days?”\n“The Fourth Bridge,” the Mink said. “Your flying machine—”\n“Would take weeks to travel that distance,” Navani said.\n“Windrunners, then,” the Mink said. “They can get a person across the\ncontinent in under a day.”\n“But an entire army?” Navani said.\n“We’d need a few hundred at most,” the Mink said. “The members of my\npersonal army, which we have rescued. If you drop us at the border on the\nwestern side, we will assault the capital a little inland, reclaiming my\nhomeland.” He placed the tattered remnant before Dalinar on the food table.\n“Your oath, Blackthorn.”\nHe stared at it. Damnation. He was going to say yes.\n“Dalinar,” Jasnah said. “Look at me.”\nHe turned from the banner, meeting her eyes.\n“Even an assault force of two hundred would require some fifty\nWindrunners. Windrunners we need to protect what we have. There are\nbarely three hundred! You can’t send so many of them on a quest like this.\nThat would make you—no offense, General Dieno—of the ten fools!”\n“I swore an oath, Jasnah,” Dalinar said.\n“But—”\n“What are we, if we don’t have our word?” Dalinar said. “Dieno. We\ncould use your knowledge in the upcoming battles. Are you certain you\nmust leave us?”\n“Yes,” he said. “I won the campaign in Emul for you. Now prove you’re\nno longer the man who burned my lands in your youth, Dalinar. Keep your\nword.”\nDalinar nodded. “I will set fifty Windrunners to the task. Go, with my\nblessing.”\nThe Mink took back his banner, held it in a fist, then gripped Dalinar’s\nshoulder in thanks. He rushed out—not looking at Jasnah as he did.\nDamnation.

It’s\nabout what brings the greatest good to the most people—and sometimes\nthat requires making difficult decisions.”\n“What makes you think,” he said, “that wasn’t a difficult decision?”\nThey continued to lock gazes, Jasnah’s will against his, until a slurping\nsound distracted her and she turned to find Lift standing next to her,\nwatching the two of them like it was some puppet show, a dozen palafruit\npits at her feet and another wiggling in her mouth. Storms above … how did\nthat girl manage to pack down so much so quickly? And be so frighteningly\nskinny at the same time?\n“So …” Lift said. “What you were sayin’ earlier.

Should taste like meat.”\n“Why?”\n“It’s all slimy and gross. Meat, it comes out of a body. It should be slimy\nand gross. Innards and blood and guts and stuff. Meat should taste like\nporridge.” She spat out the last pit, and Jasnah noticed that remarkably, all\nthe snacks Wit had brought were gone. “So, you know, fix that. Also, war\nand death and stuff. Actually, there are a whole lotsa things the Almighty\nshould fix and hasn’t. Wonder if he gets distracted by all the prayers.”\n“The fact that he’s dead,” Navani said dryly, “might be the most\ndistracting part.”\nDalinar suddenly sat up in his seat. Then stood again, looking skyward.\n“The Stormfather,” Ivory whispered in Jasnah’s ear. “I feel him near.”\n“What?” Fen asked.\n“The Stormfather has overheard our conversation,” Dalinar said. “And\nhe’s not happy.

Grass that lay like corpses.\nYet it didn’t feel dead. It was vibrant, green. But docile. Kaladin\ncrouched down to touch a clump of grass, which trustingly let him. He\nstood and ran his hands along a branch, which didn’t tremble. He tapped\nseveral of the diamond leaves, each thick with water.\nIt all seemed … frozen. Like he had access to some strange Surge that let\nhim freeze a moment and wander around in it. He felt he could turn back\nand it would all burst into motion, withdrawing from him in an instant, like\nlounging troops snapping to attention when Dalinar entered the room.\nThere were also no lifespren, despite the many plants. What a bizarre\nplace. Bizarre and somehow … wonderful?\nHe should be unnerved. A land where the plants weren’t afraid of you?\nWhere storms didn’t blow? Where you walked on soil springy beneath the\nfoot, which made a dull thump when you stomped instead of a proper\nscrape or soft smack.\nHe found it oddly peaceful. Comforting. Did a deep part of him know\nhumans had once lived on a world full of these plants? Or perhaps …\nperhaps they weren’t timid or stupid. Perhaps these plants were brave. At\nthe very least, they had never known the tyranny of the storm—and so had\nnever been forced to hide. He found beauty in that.\nIt helped that Syl was delighted by the place.\nShe zipped from tree to reed, to vine, to grass, to bush—a ribbon of light,\ntwirling and twisting while she laughed. Anytime she was a ribbon, she\nshrank back to her tiny size, but she shimmered with a variety of colors.\nSzeth moved up alongside Kaladin as they walked, preserving their\nStormlight. The next highstorm was days away, and Kaladin didn’t trust\nSzeth’s promises that the spheres would recharge as usual in Shinovar. After\nall, he admitted that during his youth, they’d almost never used them—\ninstead relying on dangerous things like candles.\nWhy in the world hadn’t Shinovar burned down? So many plants would\nsurely provide tinder. Kaladin’s people used candles only during the\nWeeping.\nSyl zipped past, doing a series of loops before going to streak through\nsome of the tinkling leaves. The trees here were bone white with knots of\ndark brown, and Szeth had seemed amused when Kaladin asked how many\ntrees in his land were strange colors. Most, it appeared, were the ordinary\nbrown and green.\n“I’d have thought,” Szeth said as Syl zipped past in the other direction,\n“that she would find this place dull. Wouldn’t it be less fun to inspect plants\nthat do not respond?”\n“Syl loves novelty,” Kaladin said. “And she’s probably having all kinds\nof fun with plants that are too slow to dodge her pranks.”\n“Curious,” Szeth said. “Here, we don’t ascribe to plants volition, or\nthoughts, or intentions as is common to your speech.

I won’t kill you then. Ha ha.\nBoth of them froze, listening to the sword chuckle to itself. Finally they\nstarted forward again, along a path through the forest. It wasn’t too\novergrown, fortunately. Kaladin tried to imagine how hard it would be to\nget through here if the plants grew all together and refused to move when\nprodded.\nSo far, there hadn’t been much of a chance to talk to Szeth, what with the\nflying. Or perhaps Kaladin merely told himself that to delay the\nawkwardness. What was the best way to start a conversation? “Hey, sorry to\nhear that you’re crazy” didn’t seem appropriate.\nInstead he tried, “Dalinar says you’ve had a rough time lately.”\n“I wouldn’t know,” Szeth replied.\n“What do you mean by that?”\n“I do not consider a time ‘rough’ or ‘not rough.’ I simply do as my\nmaster commands.”\n“And … you don’t wish it were another way?”\nSzeth eyed him. Kaladin approached a tree branch hanging low over the\npath, then rapped it with his hand, feeling foolish when it didn’t pull back.\nHe ducked underneath.\n“I am here,” Szeth said, “because this is the next step in my progress as a\nSkybreaker. My people, and my land, need me.”\n“So you’re making a choice,” Kaladin said. “Not just doing as\ncommanded. That seems good.”\n“I was commanded to find a quest of relevance,” Szeth said, “and this\npresented itself.” He followed Kaladin under the branch, his shorter stature\nmeaning he didn’t need to duck nearly as far. He moved on ahead faster, as\nif finished with the conversation.\nStorming man. Kaladin caught up. “So, do you want to talk about it?”\n“It?”\n“Life.” Storms, shouldn’t this be easier? “Dalinar says that things you’ve\ndone have left you scarred. Not only physically, but mentally.”\n“Scars exist,” Szeth said. “They are permanent once you bear them. So\nyou endure. Not only physically, but mentally.”\n“What if they aren’t permanent?” Kaladin said. “Stormlight can heal\nphysical scars. What if mental scars can heal too? If not remove them, then\nmake them more limber, easier to bear—”\n“That is irrelevant,” Szeth said. “I do not need to be healed, as I do not\ndeserve anything of the sort.

It is not needed.”\n“He wants you to listen to me though.”\n“All he asked of me was to bring you,” Szeth said. “Therefore, you are\nhere. You. The one who nearly killed me. Here. In my land, on my quest.”\nSzeth looked at him in the overcast forest, those oddly shaped eyes of his\nseeming at home in dimmer light.\n“I trust Dalinar because I must,” Szeth continued. “So I am not allowed\nto resent you. Nevertheless, do not assume I will endure you trying to ‘save’\nme, Kaladin Stormblessed. Not all beneath your judging gaze are in need of\nyour protection. Keep your attention on finding the Herald.”\nSzeth turned and continued on, purposeful.\nSyl landed beside Kaladin and whistled softly, growing to full size.\n“Well, he’s something,” she whispered.\nKaladin gritted his teeth and stalked forward, and Syl walked alongside\n—not flying, instead imitating his posture. She seemed to think he should\ntry talking to Szeth more, but storms, Kaladin understood the frustration of\nsomeone trying to force you to feel better. The sole person who’d ever\nmanaged it had been Adolin—and he had done so without pandering or\ntrying to cheer Kaladin up. Somehow. Maybe Adolin should have come on\nthis mission instead. Storming man.\nRegardless, Kaladin needed another tactic. He refused to manipulate\nSzeth into accepting help.\n“All right then,” Kaladin said, joining Szeth again. “Dalinar wants me to\nrecruit Ishar the Herald. Any ideas on that?”\n“It is a wise mission, given by a wise man,” Szeth said. “But we do not\nknow where Ishar, or Ishu-son-God as we know him, is hiding. Plus, there\nis something dangerous in this land. My mission here involves a …\ncleansing and retribution owed to the people of Shinovar.”\n“Can you tell me what you mean by that?”\n“One of the Unmade is here,” Szeth said. “Awakened years before you\nbecame a Radiant, before the first oaths were sworn. My people have\nembraced it for some reason, and welcomed in its darkness and its\nmanipulations.”\n“How can you be sure it’s an Unmade?” Kaladin said. “It took Dalinar\nages to recognize the Thrill as an Unmade.”\n“Because,” Szeth said, “before my exile, I met it.” He paused for an\ninstant. “It began during my youth. With … a rock.”\nThe others left, allowing Dalinar to confront the Stormfather alone in that\ngarden room.\nHe had grown accustomed to having the Stormfather in the back of his\nmind.

The awful feeling as you waited for a\nbattle report, already seeing that your side was faring poorly.\nDalinar wished that his metaphor for the sensation weren’t so negative,\nthat his relationship with his spren was more like others’. Some of that was\nDalinar’s fault, because of events like when he’d forced the Stormfather to\noperate an Oathgate as if he were a common Blade. It was partly the spren’s\nfault, like when the Stormfather had refused to help Kaladin at Urithiru a\nfew weeks ago, and Dalinar had been forced to step in.\nThey had their peaceful moments, but just as many disagreements. More,\nreally. And often Dalinar could feel the Stormfather’s rage flooding through\nhim, as if he were a chasm during a flash flood. Like today. When the\nStormfather spoke, the force of it made Dalinar’s fingers tremble.\nW ? the Stormfather demanded, his voice like\nHAT ARE YOU DOING\nthunderheads crashing against one another.

I fear that by\nmyself, I can’t defeat Odium.”\nA sudden gale washed over him: a completely impossible wind,\nconsidering he was in a small enclosed space. The wind seemed to blow\naway the room, turning it to Stormlight—the walls, plants, spare tables all\nweathering away like sand caught up in a tempest.\nIn a moment Dalinar was standing in an empty, open blue—hanging as if\nin the air far above the world. It was … it was a vision. Like the ones that\nhad propelled him on this course in life. His body would still be in that\nroom, perhaps collapsed upon the floor, while his mind saw what the\nStormfather wanted.\nAn open sky, and a figure building before him in the shape of dark\nclouds extending in both directions to the horizon. A face manifesting in the\nnatural shapes of the billowing clouds—features he knew as the\nStormfather’s. Bearded, though the hair vanished into the mixing and\nchurning clouds. Inhuman eyes glowing with crackling lightning. A\ndaunting, oppressive sight for one who hovered—tiny—before it.\nBut Dalinar had been the imperious general staring down a subordinate.\nHe knew these tricks.\n“Is it possible for me to take up Honor?” Dalinar demanded.\nN .\nO\n“Wit says otherwise.”\nW .\nIT IS A LIAR\n“He has offered us more help than you have.”\nH , D .

The Stormfather’s voice grew\nWILL NOT GIVE YOU ANSWERS ALINAR\nsofter, smaller. You were supposed to be better than this. You were supposed\nto be better than your brother.\n“My brother?” Dalinar said, frowning.\nHe was arrogant. I knew it. I’ve watched both of you for a long time.\nEven at his worst though, Gavilar didn’t strive for godhood. Why, Dalinar?\nWhy must you seek this?\n“Because I’m overwhelmed, Stormfather,” Dalinar said, letting his\nexhaustion show. “Because I have to somehow save everyone, but I’m just\none man, confused and outmatched. Because the only time I’ve ever felt\nlike I had any hint of control was when I stood up before Odium and\ntouched the Spiritual Realm.”\nUnity, the Stormfather said.\n“Yes.”\nThis is not for you to seek or decide. The power cannot go to one who\nwants it, Dalinar.\n“You said it was impossible earlier,” Dalinar said.\nImpossible the way you want it to happen.\n“And Cultivation, who brought this plan to me in the first place?”\nTraitor. She should know the implausibility of what she suggests.\n“So which is it, Stormfather?” Dalinar demanded. “Is it impossible, or\nmerely implausible? Is it wrong, or is it the only way to unite people, as\nI’ve been trying all along?”\nIt … This is not my plan.\n“Your plan?” Dalinar pushed. “I thought this was Honor’s plan. You said\nhe charged you to find people for the visions—so they could prepare for the\ncoming dangers. You’re filling a role, just like me.”\nYou have no idea what you’re talking about.\n“I only know what you’ve told me,” Dalinar said, feeling his anger\nmount. “I know that I’ve been stymied and cut off every time I’ve tried to\nmake progress! I’ve had to fight you almost as much as I fight our enemy!”\nHonor’s plan—\n“Honor abandoned us!” Dalinar shouted. “We don’t even know why or\nhow! All you’ll say is that he died, he faded away, he left visions and some\nplan for us to force Odium into a contest of champions. Vague, without real\ninstructions.”\nIt’s working though.\n“Is it?” Dalinar said, gesturing toward the continent far below. “You’ve\nseen what the enemy is doing.”\nI … know now.\n“They’ve outmaneuvered us already,” Dalinar said. “And they will do so\nagain!” He heard thunder, and found he was growing. When he spoke, his\nown words were punctuated by rumblings. “The enemy has changed,\nStormfather, but whoever they are, they’re a god—and can match whatever\nI try! You don’t think he can?

He stopped the tide, breathing heavily, and found\nthat—strangely—he was now the same size as the Stormfather. That was an\nimpossibility, since the Stormfather extended to infinity. But in this place,\nreality bent, and he could look the spren straight in the eyes.\nWhat you want … is dangerous.\n“It’s not what I want, Stormfather,” Dalinar said. “But it might be the\nonly way.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled softly, and he glanced down, away from\nDalinar. What of the Heralds? Perhaps the Heralds can help.\n“I sent Szeth and Kaladin to try to retrieve one,” Dalinar said. “But what\ndo you think? Can they solve this?”\nMaybe. But … they are not reliable anymore, are they? Time has broken\nthem … I’ve broken them. He looked back at Dalinar. I cannot say if the\npower would accept someone like you as a host, after what happened with\nTanavast.\n“And what happened with Tanavast?” Dalinar said.\nIt’s … worse than I told you, Dalinar.\n“So you lied.”\nYes. Does that surprise you? Anger you?\nDalinar took a deep breath, and found that he was relieved to finally get\nan admission.\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “But I can move beyond that.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled, and the dark thunderheads calmed. I’m\nsupposed to be better than lies, Dalinar. I should be constant. I am the\nwinds. I do not lie.\n“You are a person,” Dalinar said, “capable of growth. Capable of\nlearning. If that is the case, then you are capable of mistakes.”\nThe Stormfather at last met his eyes again. I don’t know what would\nhappen if you became Honor before the contest. I do not like even thinking\nabout it. However, you might find answers that will … change your\nperspective. In the Spiritual Realm, as Cultivation said. You can take that\nstep, and see the past, but do not seek the power of Honor.\nBe warned. I will not be able to control what happens to you, or where\nyou are taken. It is a process that is confusing to any who is not themself a\nShard of Adonalsium. Even your Wit, for all his boasting and self-\nimportance, can barely fathom the Spiritual Realm.

Perhaps you will see.\n“See what, exactly?”\nOur shame.\nThe vision vanished in the blink of an eye, and Dalinar found himself\nback in the tower. Standing up, remarkably, rather than having collapsed.\nWit was there. Sitting on a table with one leg up, next to a fern growing\nfrom the floor.\n“Could you see that?” Dalinar asked him.\n“I could hear it,” Wit said. “He’s both right and wrong. I do care about\nall of you, Dalinar.”\n“But Odium remaining captive on our planet is more important to you\nthan any of our lives.”\nWit nodded. “I’m sorry.”\n“Do not apologize,” Dalinar said, stretching, exhaustionspren buzzing\naround him like insects. “I appreciate the honesty.”\n“People think I detest honesty,” Wit said, “because they don’t often like\nto hear what I have to say, and so must assume I speak only lies.”\n“They’d probably enjoy it more,” Dalinar said, “if you didn’t present\nboth truth and lies in a way that belittles the listener.”\n“Fair enough,” Wit said, hopping off the table. “I assume you’ve decided\nto go forward with this plan?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, realizing it was true. “I want to start as soon as\npossible.”\n“You’ll need a way to track time in there,” Wit said. “Even if we do this\nthe smart way—which means sending your mind, but not your body—it\nwould be easy for you to let months pass. That obviously won’t do. You\nhave an appointment to keep, after all.”\n“… Months?” Dalinar said.\n“If not years. Decades. Time is entirely different in the Spiritual Realm.\nStorms, in some corner cases, you could vanish for what feels to you like a\nfew hours—while decades of time pass out here. The visions so far were\ncarefully curated and monitored by your spren, preventing you from being\nlost.”\n“Is there a way for you to monitor for us?”\nWit fished in his pocket. He brought out a little clock, with two straps on\nthe sides. The symbols on the face were unfamiliar to Dalinar. “Silverlight\nMercantile,” Wit said to his questioning glance. “Adjustable to local time\non different planets, if you swap out the face. Here, let me see that thing on\nyour forearm.”\nDalinar held up his arm, where he still wore Navani’s fabrial bracer—it\nhad a mechanism that kept the time and the date for him.\n“All right,” Wit said, “this should work. You know how you do that thing\nwhere you teach yourself languages by bonding to a region? Do that, but\nwith the clocks.”\n“Could you be clearer? ‘Do that’ isn’t much to go on.”\n“Take my clock’s soul,” Wit said, holding up his, “and Connect it by a\nthread of power to your own clock, grounding yours in the Physical Realm\nwhile you travel.” Wit looked at him. “Poke this with Stormlight, then poke\nthat.

He touched\nhis clock, and something seemed to snap. The dial quivered for a moment,\nthen continued as if nothing had happened.\n“Excellent,” Wit said.\n“So …”\n“So the clock on your arm will show the same time that mine does,” Wit\nexplained. “The date as well. Without this, your clock could adapt to your\nperception of time in the Spiritual Realm. Meaning it might feel and read\nlike an hour has passed—but in reality you could return here and find all of\nus dead and gone. Well, everyone else. I tend to linger. Rather like a winter\ncough.”\n“What about winter makes one cough?” Dalinar asked.\n“Oh, right,” Wit said. “Roshar. No common cold. You have no idea how\nwonderful life is here, do you?”\n“Are there places worse than the one being threatened with utter\ndomination by a dark, destructive god?”\n“You’d be surprised,” Wit said. “A few have political fundraisers.” He\nstrapped on his clock. “We’ll try a quick test. So long as we keep you\ntethered, time shouldn’t pass too outrageously for you compared to us, and\nyou should be able to send your mind into a vision, then return as you\nwish.”\n“Should be able?”\n“Should be able,” Wit admitted.\nNo quip. That was always a bad sign.\n“You’ll need to open a perpendicularity,” Wit said, “step into it, then let\nthe light take you. But not all of you. Push all the way through—but only\nwith your mind, or you’ll end up in Shadesmar.”\nStorms. That sounded difficult. And confusing.\nBut what else was he to do? “Let’s get Navani and Jasnah in here to\nmonitor me, then we’ll give it a try.”\nWould that men could always do the same—if I could enshrine\none law in all further legal codes, it would be this. Let people\nleave if they wish.\n—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable\nThe drizzle had fully committed to rain by the time Radiant’s team moved\ninto position. If those last few Ghostbloods were coming to the meeting,\nthey would arrive soon. And if there weren’t more coming … well, an\nenemy conference was likely underway, making it even more important that\nRadiant get into that hideout.\nSo, she helped Gaz wheel a small tool cart down the roadway, past\nrainspren like candles, each with a single eye on the top. They reached an\nintersection right in front of the Ghostblood hideout. She found the\nGhostbloods setting up here to be impressively blatant. When others made\nhideouts in grimy corners of the worst parts of a city, they chose the middle\nof a storming military camp. Some people higher in the Alethi military must\nbe in Mraize’s pocket. She’d have work to do uncovering them all.\nOnce in position, she and Red began to set up a small pavilion in the\nrain.

Soon someone from\nthe Ghostbloods—as expected—came to check on them.\nIt wasn’t the masked guard. Damnation. Radiant kept calm and allowed\nRed to handle it while she hung back, fiddling with their tools. The guard\nshe wanted—the one with the mask—emerged from the shadowed porch\nbut did not approach.\n“Hey,” the other Ghostblood said as he arrived. “What’s this?” His name\nwas Shade, a man with Horneater blood, though he looked more Alethi\ndespite the forked beard. She thought the masked woman had fetched him\nas they were setting up.\n“We’re supposed to level this intersection,” Red said. He noted Shade’s\nAlethi uniform. “I have the orders somewhere, Sergeant.”\n“You’re supposed to work in the rain?” Shade demanded.\n“Yeah. Storming unfair.” Red thumbed at the little pavilion. “At least\nwe’ve got that. If you want to take it up with the camp operations\ncommander, I wouldn’t mind a little time off.”\nShade picked through the tools, then poked around in the pavilion—\nwhile the masked guard lurked by the building. Adolin’s sessions with\nRadiant let her spot the readiness of a trained soldier: the stance, the alert\nattention.\nCalm, careful, Radiant rearranged the tools after Shade finished poking\nthrough them. He was built like a boulder, so it would be easy to assume he\nwas the more dangerous, but he didn’t have the casual grace the masked\nwoman did. Shade stepped back in thought, rain dripping down his beard.\nHe wouldn’t want to draw attention, but he also wouldn’t want random\nworkers so close to their base, maybe hearing things they shouldn’t.\n“Pack up and work somewhere else,” he told Red. “For at least a couple\nmore hours. You don’t need authorization; just tell them I gave the orders.”\nRed glanced at Radiant, and—hood pulled tight—she nodded.\n“Yes, Sergeant,” Red said with a sigh.\nThe two of them slowly began disassembling the pavilion. Shade\nreturned to the masked guard and they exchanged whispers. Then the guard\nfell into position by the door while Shade slipped inside, passing a large jar\nof the black sand that had been tied hanging outside.\n“That’s a problem,” Red whispered over the sound of beating rain. “Did\nyou catch their exchange?”\n“Mmm …” Pattern said from Radiant’s coat. “He said, ‘I want them\ngone by the time Aika and Jezinor get here.’ And the woman said, ‘Ya.’”\n“We were supposed to lure out the short one,” Red said. “We need that\nmask.”\n“I’ll go in close and deal with her,” Radiant said.\n“You sure?” Red asked. “What if she makes noise?”\n“I’ll be quick,” she replied, noting Gaz as he came trotting up to them.\n“My part’s done,” Gaz said. “Why are we taking the pavilion down?”\n“Get angry about it,” Radiant said, with a nudge from Veil. “Demand to\nknow who gave these orders.

He did well enough he even drew a\nfew angerspren. Perfect. Shallan and Red set up the pavilion again—they’d\nbarely started disassembling it—while Gaz demanded to speak to the\nsergeant who had changed their orders. With that as an excuse, Radiant told\nPattern to wait behind, then walked over to the building. She stepped out of\nthe rain into the covered porch, and hesitated by the door.\nThe guard emerged from the shadows, mask peeking from the front of\nher hood. As on Iyatil, it made the woman seem … inhuman. Painted wood,\nwithout carvings of facial features—hiding all except those eyes. Locked on\nto her.\n“Oh!” Radiant said. “Sorry. But, um, our foreman wants to talk to you.\nUm. It’s … um. Sorry …”\nThe guard took her by the arm. Radiant twisted and whipped up her\nother hand—pushing a small stiletto toward the guard’s throat. The enemy\ncaught it, her eyes narrowing, then grunted and shoved Radiant backward,\ntrying to trip her.\nA year training with Adolin gave Radiant some unexpected grit. She\nresisted the shove and kept her stance, locking eyes with the masked\ncreature.\nNow, she ordered her armor.\nIn a blink, the armor formed. Not around her, but around the guard,\nfreezing her in place as it had Red earlier. Radiant caught a glimpse of a\npair of shocked eyes as the helmet encased the woman’s face.\nShallan! the creationspren said, eager.\n“Just keep her mouth closed,” she said. “Like the drawing Shallan did\nfor you. Right?”\nShallan! they replied in a chorus. The only sound from the guard was\nmuffled exertion, so hopefully the helmet plan was working. Radiant\nthought they’d explained it well enough to the creationspren: a mechanism\nthat held the jaw shut by making the helmet tighter at the bottom, below the\nmask.\nShe checked the sand in the hanging jar. Still black, as she’d hoped.\nThey’d said that it took an intelligent spren to activate the stuff—which\nmade sense, otherwise it would be useless, turning white in warning\nwhenever someone got anxious. Her Plate spren hadn’t affected it even\nwhen forming.\nRed and Gaz came jogging up. “It worked,” Radiant whispered, her heart\nthumping from the exchange.\nGaz nodded toward the woman’s motionless left hand, raising a knife\ntoward Radiant—the gauntlet had simply formed around it, letting the blade\npeek out. She’d missed that entirely. A good warning. A year of practice had\ngiven her some skill, but it was a weak substitute for a lifetime of battle\nexperience.\n“Eh,” Red whispered, wheeling over the cart, “she could have healed\nfrom it.”\n“And what would that have done to the sand?” Gaz whispered, gesturing\ntoward the glass jar. “We’re not sure if a healing will activate it or not. If so,\nthe first person who stepped through that door would have known a Radiant\nhad been here.” He inspected the armor closer, locked down as it was. “Yet"

I can barely hear her.”\nThe captive woman didn’t even tremble from struggling to escape.\nTogether, they managed to tip her into the two-wheeled cart, throw a tarp\nover her, then wheel it into their small pavilion. Had any guards on the\nwalls seen? Darcira and the strike team were poised to intercept any who\ncame running, but still she worried.\nMove quickly, Shallan thought, taking over from Radiant. She didn’t\nwant the last few Ghostbloods to arrive at the door and find the guard\nmissing.\nGaz put his arms around the head of the armored woman to be in\nposition. He nodded.\nShallan touched the armor. Could you dismiss just the helmet please? she\nasked.\nShallan! the armor said. The helmet vanished in a puff of Stormlight.\nGaz snapped his arms around the woman’s neck, executing a perfect choke\nhold. Shallan needed Radiant again for a moment while watching the\nstruggling woman be strangled, her eyes bulging, her skin going a deep red\naround the mask.\nGaz didn’t kill her, though he held on longer than Radiant thought\nnecessary. He’d explained earlier: assuming your attacker didn’t want to kill\nyou, the best way to escape a choke hold was to pretend to fall unconscious\nearly. So Gaz ignored the struggles, the painspren, the frantic eyes, the\nsudden limpness and counted to himself softly.\nShe’d never asked how he knew this so well.\nGaz nodded, and Shallan dismissed the armor, then began stripping to\nher undergarments while the two other Lightweavers efficiently undressed\nthe guard, then bound and gagged her. Gaz had warned Shallan that people\nusually didn’t stay unconscious for long after being choked out. Indeed, the\nguard was stirring as Shallan finished re-dressing, wearing the woman’s\nclothing. Utilitarian brown leathers that weren’t particularly formfitting,\nalong with a hooded cloak and a frightening number of knives strapped\nacross her person.\nThough Shallan was accustomed to being short compared to the Alethi,\nshe was a tad taller than this offworlder. Close enough, hopefully. She\nalready had her hair under a wig, but her options had been limited, so she\nwas distressed to notice that the guard had closer-cropped hair than the\npictures had depicted. Storms. She’d cut her hair, which meant Shallan\nwould have to leave the hood up indoors. Would that seem odd?\nRed knelt beside the figure, then—appearing more unnerved by this than\nstripping a captive—tried to figure out how to remove the mask. Turned out\nit was bound in place by two cords, which he undid, and pulled the red-\norange mask free. Shallan had expected it to stick—she’d always felt that\nIyatil had worn hers so long that the skin had grown over it. That proved an\nincorrect assumption; the mask was obviously removed and cleaned often,\nbut it was also worn so continuously that it left imprints on the guard’s face.\nHer skin was as pale as Shallan’s, and without the mask she seemed far\nless dangerous.

Aside from the eyeholes,\nit had two holes near the nose for breathing, and a small portion was\nmissing for the mouth—like a bite had been taken out of it at the chin.\nRed nodded. “Looks pretty good.”\n“I don’t know,” Gaz replied, scratching his cheek. “It would fool a casual\npasserby. But Ghostbloods?”\nShallan fell into an imitation of the woman’s stance. Dangerous, ready.\nStepping with the kind of casual grace that took years to perfect. She\nnarrowed her eyes behind the mask, mimicking the woman’s expression—\nconveying it through posture.\nWell done, Veil thought.\nRed glanced at Gaz, cocking an eyebrow.\n“All right, fine,” Gaz said. “I still find it creepy how she can do things\nlike that. Just don’t take the hood off. The hair is wrong.”\nA moment later, Darcira ducked into the pavilion. “You’re not in place\nyet?”\n“Going now,” Shallan said in a whisper, as it was easier to mask her\nvoice that way.\n“Did you find your watchpost?” Darcira said to Gaz.\n“Yeah,” he said. “Neutralized them fast enough to show up here and\nhelp. What took you so long?”\n“Had to go and position the strike team, if you forgot,” Darcira said.\n“What do we do if there were more than two observation posts watching the\nbase?”\nNone of them could answer that, but they’d spotted only two in their\nsweep of the area. They had to trust in their skills. Shallan slipped one of\nher team’s spanreeds into her sleeve, glanced at Pattern—dimpling the\nwood of the cart, humming to himself nervously—then waved goodbye.\nShe left them, instead falling into place by the alcove. She maintained the\nsame posture and stance as before. Sticking to shadows. Not speaking.\nYou can do this, Veil whispered.\nHer heart still thrummed like listener war drums. She was going to enter\nthe enemy stronghold alone—and could not use her powers. But it was the\nonly way. What did you do when there was a guard watching for you?\nYou became the guard.\nNot five minutes later, Shallan spotted two people trotting up to the\nsafehouse. Aika and Jezinor, a pair of Thaylen traders. They’d arrived with\nQueen Fen’s retinue, which explained why they were some of the last.\nThey’d needed to find an excuse to come to the Shattered Plains.\nShallan’s nervousness faded as she made a good show of checking their\nfeatures with her hands, then holding the glass jar of sand up to each one."

She knocked on the door, as she’d\nseen done before. Shade opened it and waved the other two in. Shallan\nslipped in herself, and he held the door open for her. They’d be trusting\ntheir watchposts to send spanreed warnings if anything approached the\nsafehouse. Posting a guard outside for too long risked drawing attention.\nThis was it. Veil was right, she could do this. Unless they asked her to\nsay too much. Unless there was a third watchpost they hadn’t found. Unless\nher disguise failed.\nIt was too late now. She had walked confidently straight into the den.\nNow she either proved to be a predator herself, or she got eaten.\nNavani left Dalinar alone in the room with the plants to talk to the\nStormfather while she stepped outside with the others, knowing he’d fill her\nin later.\nShe entered a world of chaos. Strategists planning, messengers running\norders, a world spinning up to deal with another crisis. It was time to be a\nqueen. Which regrettably meant dealing with all the random issues that no\none else could. At the perimeter of the room, at least a dozen people waited\nfor her attention.\nSo many systems had fallen apart during the occupation. Schooling had\nbeen ignored. Trade for less important supplies—everything from extra\nbuttons to feed for pet axehounds—had been interrupted. Now, with the\ntower awakened, many problems were being solved while others—such as\nwho got to use which services when—were just beginning.\nThey could handle it without her, but they didn’t know it. And …\nperhaps she needed to banish such thoughts. She was important to the\nadministration of this tower, this kingdom. Vital even.\nSo she went into motion, assigning some of her staff to various\nproblems. Makal to rehouse people whose living quarters now turned out to\nbe important for other reasons. Venan to organize meals for everyone\nattending the meeting, and to covertly keep a list of who was sending what\nmessages where, just in case.\nNext she found Highprince Sebarial and Palona waiting for her. They\nhad learned an unfortunate lesson: that sometimes you had to put yourself\nwhere Navani could see you in order to get her time. They had questions\nabout how to get supplies into the city if there was a war on the Shattered\nPlains.\n“We can’t keep relying on the Oathgates,” Sebarial said, rubbing his\nforehead. The girthy man had gone back to wearing an open-fronted\ntakama, now that the weather was summer at the tower, and his belly poked\nout in a way he reportedly thought was distinguished. “But organizing\nshipments from Azir up through these mountains is going to be an\nenormous hassle. Flying them in will be prohibitively expensive in\nStormlight unless we can make more airships. Yes, we can grow food now,\nbut other supplies …”\n“Bring me proposals,” Navani said, looking over Palona’s ledgers.\n“This was supposed to make me rich!” Sebarial said. “I was Highprince\nof Commerce! I was supposed to be able to skim thousands to line my own"

But I can barely make any of this balance. There’s nothing to\nskim!”\n“Don’t mind him, Brightness,” Palona said. “He’s having a rough time\nwith how responsible he’s becoming.”\n“You’re good at being useful, Sebarial,” Navani said. “That’s the\nproblem, isn’t it?”\n“My darkest secret,” he grumbled. “I still pay for my household staff,\nvacations, and massages out of public funds, I’ll have you know. It’s a huge\nscandal.”\n“I’m sure Brightness Navani knows what a miscreant you are,\ngemheart,” Palona said, patting his arm.\nHe sighed. “We’re mobilizing troops to Thaylenah and the Shattered\nPlains. You’re authorizing active battle pay, then? You realize this is going\nto dip into what little we have remaining? We might be able to offer extra\nrations instead of battle pay in some cases.”\n“Thank the Almighty for the emeralds we got on the Shattered Plains,”\nPalona said. “It’s the only way we’re making enough food for everyone\nright now.”\n“I’ll see if we can get more time with the Radiant Soulcasters,” Navani\nsaid. “Given the way the tower is functioning, we can have them working at\nan increased speed.”\n“They break gemstones as they work, Brightness,” Sebarial said. “Even\nRadiant Soulcasters need gems as a focus, which means we can’t continue\nlike this forever. We’ll need a gemheart ranch up here, but there isn’t a lot\nof space, so we can’t lose the Shattered Plains.”\nShe did her best to calm him, then took a meeting with Highprince\nAladar on the status of the lighteyes. There was a lot of general panic about\nJasnah’s work to free the Alethi slaves, a decision that Dalinar had copied\nfor Urithiru after some persuasion. It would be a slow process, designed to\ntake effect over time, with social systems in place to facilitate. Jasnah, as\nusual, had done her research.\nHowever, the lighteyes were pushing back. “Tradition will be cast to the\nwinds,” Aladar said. “The upright, natural order of things is being trampled.\nHow can the lighteyed families maintain themselves without lands and\ntaxes? What does it even mean to be lighteyed any longer?”\n“It means what it has always meant,” Navani said.\n“Which is?” Aladar asked. “Brightness, with the elevation of\nStormblessed to a full house, and now to third dahn, what about the other\nRadiants? More than three-quarters of them were darkeyed and are now\nlight. It’s chaos!”\n“It’s a problem for after the contest, Aladar,” Navani said. “When we’re\nnot focused on a mass invasion. For now, I need logistical work from you.\nMake certain that supplies are transferred per the generals’ requests. Fen\ncan provision some of the soldiers we send her, but if we move battalions to\nNarak they’ll run out of water quickly if we don’t prepare. Also, make sure"

Also, make sure\nto check on Adolin and get him what he needs.”\nThe stately bald man shook his head and sighed. “As you wish—but my\nconcerns won’t go away, Brightness. This problem is a bubbling cauldron.\nIt’s going to overflow. Only the invasions are stopping it.”\n“I know,” she said. “But let’s worry about the crisis we are facing now\nfirst, Aladar.”\nHe bowed, then went to see to her orders. She tried not to be annoyed—\nand commanded the appearing irritationspren to vanish. Aladar was\nreasonable for a highlord, and was simply passing on what the less\nreasonable highlords were thinking. They were a powerful contingent, and\nhadn’t failed to notice that—after years of politicking—almost everyone\nwho had opposed Dalinar was now dead. Rumors about what had really\nhappened to Sadeas churned, for all that Jasnah worked behind the scenes to\nquash them.\nYes, the upper ranks of the lighteyes were a bubbling cauldron.\nUnfortunately for them, the darkeyes had been boiling for far longer—and\nthey suddenly had access to advocates in the form of people who could\nbend the laws of reality. She suspected that if it came to a head, the\nlighteyes would discover how little “tradition” was worth in the face of\ncenturies of pent-up rage.\nNavani put that problem out of her mind for the time being. It was\ndangerous to do so, but she had to perform mental triage. War was upon\nthem, and for eight more days she needed to keep everyone pointed the\nsame direction. She worked through a dozen other problems as\nfunctionaries and aides found her. She kept turning and finding lifespren\nswirling around her, or gloryspren skulking by the ceiling, or any number of\nthem darting around. It was like she was some storming heroine from a\nstory, the silly type where a young and innocent girl always had a thousand\nlifespren or whatever bobbing around her.\nAs she worked, she kept glancing toward the room where Dalinar met\nwith the Stormfather. He’d always been ambitious. But this?\nIs it right, what he contemplates? she asked the Sibling. Ascending to\nHonor?\nSomeone will need to eventually, the Sibling said. The power can’t be left\nto its own devices. It will come awake.\nWhy hasn’t it already? It’s been thousands of years.\nWhatever the reason, be glad. These powers aren’t like the tiny pieces\nthat become spren. The power of a Shard needs a partner, a Vessel. Without\nit …\nWhat? Navani asked.\nGreat danger. We do not think as humans do. To separate the power from\nthose who are attached to the Physical Realm … that should frighten you. It\nis not so terrible a thing for part of me to despise you. But for the power of\na god to? Dangerous. For all of us.\nNavani shivered at the Sibling’s tone, but had to keep working. She\nchecked in with her scholars, who had been waiting patiently in the next"

She\nchecked in with her scholars, who had been waiting patiently in the next\nroom—one of the few small ones that made a ring around the lifts up here.\nInside, seven ardents had set up a display. Navani hated to make them cart it\nall the way up here, but despite the faster lifts, there just wasn’t time for her\nto go elsewhere for meetings. People needed to come to her.\nRushu met her at the doorway, in her usual grey ardent’s robes, sweat\ntrickling down her brow. Indeed, this room was uncomfortably warm. The\npretty woman was, as usual, trailed by several young male ardents eager for\nher attention. In this case they’d volunteered to set up Rushu’s presentation.\nEven after all these years, Navani couldn’t decide if Rushu was oblivious or\ndeliberate in the way she ignored masculine interest.\n“Brightness!” Rushu said, bowing as she entered. “Thank you for\nmaking the time.”\n“I don’t have long, I’m afraid,” Navani said. “Dalinar’s antagonizing the\nStormfather again, and I’ll need to go the moment he’s ready to talk.”\n“Understood, Brightness,” Rushu said, walking her to a counter set up\nwith some fabrials and a small oven burning Soulcast coal, of all things. A\nseparate attractor fabrial above it collected the smoke and invisible deadly\ngases in a sphere of swirling blackness, allowing the small oven to burn\nwithout scent or the need for a chimney. Flamespren played within, their\niridescent forms mimicking the shape of the fire and the molten red\ncoloring of the hearts of coal.\nBeside the oven was a more modern heating device, a large ruby fabrial\nlike the ones they’d installed in many rooms. Those were proving, to the\nSibling’s annoyance, more effective than the tower’s ancient methods,\nwhich required heating air in a boiler at the center of each floor, then\nblowing it into the specific room when requested. While that was amazing,\na simple ruby heating fabrial didn’t waste energy keeping massive boilers\ngoing all the time. Unfortunately, modern fabrials had other problems, at\nleast in the eyes of the Sibling.\n“We’ve only had a day or so to work,” Rushu said, “but I wanted to\nshow you our progress. This was an enlightened idea you had—and could\nrevolutionize the fabrial art! Brightness … this could be your legacy.”\n“Our legacy, Rushu,” Navani said. “You’re doing the work.”\n“Pardon, Brightness. It’s your idea. Your genius.”\nNavani prepared another complaint, then … then discarded it. Storms,\nmaybe she was growing. “Thank you, Rushu. Let’s not assume we’ve\nchanged the world after one day’s work though. Show me what you’ve\ndone.”\nRushu unlatched the glass front of the oven. The group of flamespren\nwithin shivered as the cool air entered, then continued to frolic, taking the\nshapes of small minks cavorting over the surface of the burning coal.\nShe plucked a coal out with a pair of tongs, then nodded to one of her"

The heating fabrial next to the oven had an outlet valve:\nbasically, a hole drilled into the gemstone that they kept plugged with an\naluminum stopper. The assistant unscrewed the plug and opened the valve,\nusually something quite inadvisable. Because the moment he did so, the\nflamespren in the heating fabrial—a vital piece of what powered it—would\nescape.\nThis one scrambled out onto the plug and immediately started to vanish\nback into the Cognitive Realm. Then Rushu held her coal close to it.\nAnother ardent used tuning forks to play what they hoped was a comforting\ntone to the spren. Instead of vanishing, the flamespren hopped onto the coal\nin Rushu’s hand and let her deposit it in the oven. She came out a moment\nlater with a different flamespren on another coal, blinking glowing red eyes,\nred “fur” blazing along its form.\nCalmed by the tone, it let her bring it over to the fabrial. They trapped it\ninside using modern techniques of Stormlight diffusion. Then, with the\ngemstone plugged and a new spren inside, they recharged the fabrial with a\nRadiant’s help and turned it back on so it began heating again.\nWhat abomination are you creating now? the Sibling asked in Navani’s\nhead.\nAbomination? Navani replied. Did you not see what we just did?\nEnslaving spren, the Sibling said, in torment and captivity.\nNavani leaned down by the front glass of the oven, where the spren were\nscampering across the coals. Torment, you say? Tell me, Sibling, which of\nthese spren was the one held captive? If it was tormented, I can’t see any\nlasting effect.\nIt’s still wrong to keep spren in such small prisons, the Sibling said.\n“Brightness,” Rushu said, leaning in beside her and looking at the spren\nin the oven, “this is really possible. Did you read the writings of Geranid\nand Ashir I gave you?”\n“Some of it,” Navani said. “Before the invasion. I know they’ve been\nable to keep the same flamespren for months at a time, without losing them\nto the Cognitive Realm. It requires maintenance of a fire.”\n“Yes, but there’s more!” Rushu said. “Their research taught me\nsomething amazing: the flamespren will stay even longer if you give them\ntreats.”\n“What kind of treats do flamespren want?” Navani asked. “More coal?”\n“Names,” Rushu said. “Names and compliments. Brightness, if you think\nabout the spren, they mold to your thoughts.”\n“I read about the molding process,” Navani said. “If you measure them,\nthey lock to those measurements. But … compliments?”\n“This one is Bippy,” Rushu said, pointing to one of the spren. “See how\nits head has that little tuft on top?”\nBippy looked toward them at the attention, then hopped up to the edge of\nthe oven, staring out with too-large eyes. A bit of fire itself, responding to\nRushu merely mentioning its name."

It’s too\nearly to tell, but Brightness, you might be right. If they can be trained …\nthen we can teach them to go in and out of fabrials on command.”\nDomesticated flamespren? the Sibling asked. Nonsense.\nIs it? Navani asked, still watching Bippy. Rushu moved her finger back\nand forth in front of the glass, and Bippy ran to follow it. When Rushu\ncomplimented the spren on its trick, Navani could have sworn that Bippy\nglowed brighter. Intelligent spren seek bonds with people. Why not lesser\nspren?\nIt … it isn’t natural, the Sibling said.\nPardon, Sibling, Navani said. But neither is living in towers that are\nclimate controlled. If we conformed only to what was natural, my people\nwould be living naked in the wilderness and defecating on the ground.\nThe Sibling simmered in the back of her mind, like a burning coal\nthemself.\nYou’ve said our practices are cruel, Navani said, trying to soften her\ntone. I’m attempting to do something about that. We keep chulls as beasts of\nburden; can we not do the same for spren? If being in a fabrial is\nuncomfortable for a spren … well, so is pulling a cart for a chull. But\nassuming it’s not too bad, we should be able to train them to do it willingly,\nwith rewards. We can … cultivate them, Sibling. Isn’t this a better way? To\nhave spren take shifts in the fabrials, with training to get in and out\nwillingly?\nShe held her breath, waiting. The Sibling had been hard-nosed about\nthis.\nSee my heart, Sibling, she sent. See that I’m trying.\nI see, the Sibling said. Rushu jolted and looked around, as did the other\nardents, indicating the Sibling had chosen to be audible to them as well.\nThis is a good thing you attempt. All spren being free would be preferable.\nBut … if this works … perhaps I can see a compromise. Thank you. For\nlistening and changing. I had forgotten that people are capable of that.\nNavani released a held breath, and with it a mountain of tension. Rushu’s\neyes had gone wide, and the ardent fiddled in her pocket, pulling free a\nnotebook.\n“Sibling?” Rushu whispered, awespren bursting around her. “Thank you\nfor talking to me. Thank you so much!”\nWhat is this? the Sibling asked Navani.\nRushu’s been asking after you constantly since we bonded, Navani\nthought. Haven’t you heard?"

Haven’t you heard?\nAs I said, I don’t pay attention to every word spoken inside my halls, the\nSibling said. Only to what is relevant. Then, after a pause, they continued,\nIs this relevant?\nTo Rushu, yes, Navani said.\nWith her notepad out, Rushu bit her lip and looked to Navani pleadingly.\n“Rushu would like the chance to talk to you,” Navani said out loud. “I\nthink she wants to ask you about fabrials.”\n“Very well,” the Sibling said, and Rushu gasped softly. You should go,\nNavani. I believe your husband’s conversation with my sibling is finished.\nThere will be ramifications.\nNavani nodded. As she left, though, she heard the first of Rushu’s\nquestions—and was surprised that it wasn’t about fabrials at all.\n“Navani tells me,” Rushu said, “that you are neither male nor female.”\n“It is true.”\n“Could you tell me more about that?” Rushu asked.\n“To a human, it must sound very strange.”\n“Actually, it doesn’t,” Rushu said quietly. “Not in the slightest. But talk,\nplease. I want to know how it feels to be you.”\nNavani left them to it, pleased. The fabrial experiment showed promise\n—but more, if she could get the Sibling talking to other scholars, she\nsuspected that would help with the spren’s reintegration. So far, the Sibling\nonly worked with them because Navani had essentially bullied them back\ninto a bond. The more friends, or at least acquaintances, that the Sibling\nhad, the better.\nFor now though, it was time for Navani to deal with another spren. And\nwith a husband who had decided to become a god.\nTWENTY-SIX YEARS AGO\nSzeth-son-Neturo found magic upon the wind, and so he danced with it.\nStrict, methodic motions at first, as per the moves he had memorized. He\nstepped and spun, dancing in a wide circle around the large boulder. Szeth\nwas as the limbs of the oak, rigid but ready. When those shivered in the\nwind, Szeth thought he could hear their souls seeking to escape, to shed\nbark like shells and emerge with new skin, pained by the cool air—yet\naflush with joy. Painful and delightful, like all new things.\nSzeth’s bare feet scraped across the packed earth as he danced, getting it\non his toes, loving the feel of the soil. He went right to the edge, feet kissing\nthe grass—then danced back, spinning to the accompaniment of his sister’s\nflute. The music was his dance partner, wind made animate through sound.\nThe flute was the voice of air itself.\nTime became thick when he danced. Molasses minutes and syrup\nseconds. Yet the wind wove among them, visiting each moment, lingering,\nthen dashing away. He followed it. Emulated it. Became it.\nMore and more fluid he became as he circled the stone.

Five feet across and\nthree feet high—at least the part that emerged from the soil—it was the\nlargest in the region.\nWhen he was wind, he felt he could touch that sacred stone, which had\nnever known the hands of man. He imagined how it would feel. The stone\nof his family. The stone of his past. The stone to whom he gave his dance.\nHe stopped finally, panting. His sister’s music cut off, leaving his only\napplause the bleating of the sheep. Molli the ewe had wandered onto the\ncircular dance track again, and—bless her—was trying to eat the sacred\nrock. She never had been the smartest of the flock.\nSzeth breathed deeply, sweat streaming from his face, wetting the packed\nearth below with speckles like stars.\n“You practice too hard,” his sister—Elid-daughter-Zeenid—said.\n“Seriously, Szeth. Can’t you ever relax?”\nShe stood up from the grass and stretched. Elid was fourteen, three years\nolder than he was. Like him, she was on the shorter side—though she was\nsquat where he was spindly. Trunk and branch, Dolk-son-Dolk called them.\nWhich was appropriate, even if both Dolks were idiots.\nShe wore orange as her splash: the vivid piece of colorful clothing that\nmarked them as people who added. One article per person, of whatever\ncolor they desired. In her case, a bright orange apron across a grey dress\nand vibrant white undergown. She spun her flute in her fingers, uncaring\nthat she had broken her previous one doing exactly that.\nSzeth bowed his head and went to get some water from the clay trough.\nTheir homestead was nearby: a sturdy building constructed of boards, held\ntogether with wooden pegs. No metal, of course. Szeth’s father worked on\nthe rooftop, plugging a hole. Normally he oversaw the other shepherds,\nvisiting them to give them help. There was some kind of training involved,\nwhich Szeth didn’t understand. What kind of training did shepherds need?\nYou just had to listen to the sheep, and follow them, and keep them safe.\nNeturo was between assignments, working on the house he and his\nbrothers had built. In a field opposite the home—distant but visible—the\nmajority of their sheep grazed. A few, like Molli, preferred to stay close.\nSzeth liked when they could use fields near the homestead, as he could be\nnear the stone and dance for it.\nHe dipped a wooden spoon into the trough and sipped rainwater, pure\nand clean. He peered through it to the clay bottom—he loved seeing things\nthat couldn’t be seen, like air and water.\n“Why do you practice so hard?” Elid said. “There’s nobody here but a\ncouple of the sheep.”\n“Molli likes my dancing,” Szeth said softly.\n“Molli is blind,” Elid said. “She’s licking the dirt.”"

We\nmust learn to add so that—”\nShe threw a dirt clod at him. He dodged easily, his feet light on the\nground. He might be only eleven, but some in the village whispered he was\nthe best dancer among them. He didn’t care about being the best. He only\ncared about doing it right. If he did it wrong, then he had to practice more.\nElid didn’t think that way. It bothered him how apathetic she had become\nabout practicing as she grew older. She seemed like a different person these\ndays.\nSzeth tied his splash back on—a red handkerchief he wore around his\nneck—and did a quick count of the sheep.\nElid continued to stare at the sky. “Do you believe the stories they tell,”\nshe eventually said, “of the lands on the other side of the mountains?”\n“The lands of the stonewalkers? Why wouldn’t I?”\n“They just sound so outlandish.”\n“Elid, listen to yourself. Of course stories of outlanders sound\noutlandish.”\n“Lands where everyone walks on stones though? What do they do?

A splash\nfor Roshar.\n“I think,” he said to Elid, “that there must be a lot more rock out there. I\nthink it’s hard to walk without stepping on stone. That’s why they get\ndesensitized.”\n“Where do the plants grow, then?” she asked. “Everyone always talks\nabout how the outside is full of dangerous plants that eat people. There must\nbe soil.”\nTrue. Maybe the terrible vines he’d heard of stretched out long, like the\ntentacles you might find on a shamble, or one of the beasts that lived in the\ntidal pools a short distance down the coast.\n“I heard,” Elid said, “that people constantly kill each other out there.\nThat nobody adds, they only subtract.”\n“Who makes the food then?” he said.\n“They must eat each other. Or maybe they’re always starving? You know\nhow the men on the ships are …”\nHe nervously looked toward the ocean—though it could be seen only on\nthe sunniest days. Technically, his family was part of the farming town of\nClearmount, which was at the very edge of a broad plain, excellent for\ngrazing. This part of Shinovar wasn’t crowded; it was a day or two between\ntowns. He heard that in the north there were towns everywhere.\nThe grassland bordered the southeastern coast of Shinovar.

Clearmount,\nand Szeth’s family homestead, was in an honored location near the\nmonastery of the Stonewards, which was up along the mountain ridge. In\nSzeth’s estimation, this was the perfect place to live. You could see the\nmountains yet also visit the ocean. You could walk for days across the\nvibrant green prairie, never seeing another person. During the early months\nof the year they grazed the animals here, near their homestead. In the mid\nmonths they would take the sheep up the slopes, seeking the untouched and\novergrown grass there.\nHe bent down next to old Molli, scratching at her ears as she rubbed her\nhead against him. She might lick rocks and eat dirt, but she was always\ngood for a hug. He loved her warmth, the scratchy wool on his cheek, the\nway she kept him company when the others wandered.\nShe bleated softly when he finished hugging her. Szeth wiped the salty,\ndried sweat from his head. Maybe he shouldn’t practice dancing so hard,\nbut he knew he’d made a few missteps. Their father said that they were\nblessed as people who could add beneath the Farmer’s eyes. The perfect\nstation. Not required to toil in the field, not forced to kill and subtract—\nallowed to tend the sheep and develop their talents.\nFree time was the greatest blessing in the world. Maybe that was why the\nmen of the oceans sought to kill them and steal their sheep. It must make\nthem angry to see such a perfect place as this. Those terrible men, like any\npetulant child, destroyed what they could not have.\n“Do you think,” Elid whispered, “that the servants of the monasteries\nwill ever come out and fight for us? Use the swords during one of the\nraids?”\n“Elid!” he said, standing. “The shamans would never subtract.”\n“Mother says they practice with the Blades. I’d like to see that, hold one.\nWhy practice, except to—”\n“They will fight the Voidbringers when they arrive,” Szeth snapped.\n“That is the reason.” He glanced toward the ocean. “Don’t speak of the\nswords. If the outsiders realized the treasures of the monasteries …”\n“Ha,” she said. “I’d like to see them try to raid a monastery. I saw an\nHonorbearer once. She could fly. She—”\n“Don’t speak of it,” he said. “Not in the open.”\nElid rolled her eyes at him, still lying on the grass. What had she done\nwith her flute? If Father had to make yet another … She hated when he\nbrought that up, so he forced himself to stay quiet. He pulled away from\nMolli, and then looked down at the ground she’d been licking.\nTo find another rock.\nSzeth recoiled, part shocked, part terrified. It was small, only a handspan\nwide. It peeked up from the earth, perhaps revealed by last night’s rain.\nSzeth put his fingers to his lips, backing away. Had he stepped on it while\ndancing? It was in the packed earth of the dancing ring.\nWhat … what should he do? This was the first stone he’d ever seen"

The ones in other villages and fields—carefully marked off and\nproperly revered—had been there for years.\n“What’s up with you?” Elid said.\nHe simply gestured. She, perhaps sensing his level of concern, rose and\nwalked over. As soon as she saw it, she gasped.\nThey shared a glance. “I’ll get Father,” Szeth said, and started running.\nThe Almighty has given us the limbs to move and the minds to\ndecide. Let no monarch take away what was divinely granted. The\nHeralds also taught that all should have the sacred right of\nfreedom of movement, to escape a bad situation. Or simply to\nseek a brighter dawn.\n—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable\nWalking into that safehouse was like stepping into a memory: that of\nShallan’s first meeting with Mraize. There, she’d entered the basement of a\nbuilding that shouldn’t have had one. Here—after following Shade through\nthe entryway—she headed down another set of stairs cut into the stone.\nThey were smooth and well-shaped, dark with lichen, with some crem\nbuildup at the corners of the steps—indicating that water had occasionally\nseeped in during the many years this place was unoccupied. Using a\ndiamond for light, Shade took them down, and Shallan wondered at the\nancients who had crafted it. Why would you build downward, risking\nflooding?\nThe air was damp in here, though the stones weren’t wet, and she soon\nsmelled incense. At the bottom of the stairs Shallan found the Alethi woman\nwho had been sent to spy on Dalinar. The actor, an acolyte Ghostblood who\nhad probably been teased with membership like Shallan.\nThe woman was studying Mraize’s trophies. Housed in a small room full\nof glass-fronted cases, each unlabeled artifact had its own shelf lit by a\nhandful of chips. A silvery horn or claw from some great beast. A chunk of\nlight red crystal, like pink salt—though of a deeper, more vibrant color. A\nviolet stone egg, partly crystalline, with silver swirling around its shell. A\nfat, succulent leaf that pulsed red and seemed to radiate heat. A vial of pale\nsand she now recognized as having a very practical application.\nSecrets, each stoking her hunger. She’d been strung along with the\npromise of a feast of answers, ideas, even dreams. Worlds full of people for\nher sketch collection. Shade let the newcomers linger to look at the\ntrophies, but Shallan feigned indifference, leaning against the wall and\nglancing through the eyeholes in the mask toward the glass case beside her.\nThere, in the reflection on the glass, she glimpsed a shadowy figure with\nwhite holes for eyes. Sja-anat, one of the Unmade, was here. She studied\nShallan in turn, existing in this realm only as a reflection, then smiled in a\nknowing way and vanished.\nStorms.

Shallan risked following—though Shade remained behind with the\nactor—and closed the door after them.\nThe room beyond turned out to be large, bigger than the building above,\nthough the ceiling was relatively low. It was entirely stone, with little\nfurniture, and her door was in the northeast corner. The southern wall—to\nShallan’s left, maybe forty feet away—was stacked with bales of hay,\ntargets on each one. Maybe twenty feet ahead of her, seven people clustered\naround a lone podium. They chatted softly, and Shallan’s breath caught as\nshe saw Mraize with the group, fiddling with some contraption.\nHis very silhouette still intimidated her. He had a lean strength that never\nquite matched his fine clothing—which today was a coat, shirt, and\ntrousers, with a ruffled portion of his shirt bursting out below the neck.\nBright red, like blood from a slit throat.\nRemember your breathing, Veil whispered. Keep it up, kid.\nShallan nodded absently and did her breathing exercises, calming her\nemotions. Half of the act of an imitation like this was about emotions, and\nnot drawing the wrong spren. She could do this. No need for anxiety.\nMraize barely glanced over as the two newcomers joined six others.\nShallan hung back, breathing calmingly and scanning the room, the mask\nsitting strangely on her face and blocking some of her field of vision. Where\nwas Iyatil?\nThere. She saw the woman watching the group from beside the north\nwall, giving her a full view of the room. Short and masked, Iyatil crouched\non the stone ground. Others, particularly those from Alethi culture, might\nhave mistaken her for a guard, but she was the master, and Mraize her\nsecond.\nStorms. Where Mraize was an overt, blatant kind of dangerous—always\nholding some sort of weapon, talking about hunting and death—Iyatil was\nthe quiet kind. The kind that watched from the shadows, ruminating on the\nsounds you’d make when stabbed.\nShallan stepped forward, because standing in the doorway would draw\nattention. She forced herself to adopt the proper gait, and found her\ncounterpart—the third masked offworlder—watching from all the way\nacross the room by the west wall. He prowled forward, passing a stand of\nburning incense, and approached the two newcomers where—Shallan could\nbarely hear—he offered them a drink.\nThe guard slunk to a bar set up against the east wall near Shallan and\nstarted mixing the drinks. This was a trained assassin—and Mraize was\nhaving him … mix drinks? Was this a way of intimidating the others?\nNo. No, the Ghostbloods were relaxed. They just needed drinks, and the\nassassin was the one available to get them.\n“Ah,” Mraize said as the large contraption in his hands clicked. “There.”\nHe hefted it and placed a small, heavy arrow into it. The device was a kind\nof crossbow, though larger and bulkier than the ones Shallan had seen."

The device was a kind\nof crossbow, though larger and bulkier than the ones Shallan had seen.\nIntrigued, Shallan stepped closer. Then she checked Iyatil and the other\nmasked offworlder. They were watching not the device but the people.\nRight; Shallan tried to do the same, moving along the north wall, behind the\ngroup of people, who faced the targets.\n“Mraize!” said Aika, the Thaylen trader in a skirt and vest. “You said this\nmeeting was urgent; why are you playing with a new toy while we have\ndrinks?”\n“Had to wait for stragglers, Stolen Purse,” he said, with a smile. “And a\ngood drink, well studied, is an excellent start to any difficult conversation.”\n“Feels strange,” said the other Thaylen, “to have so many of us together.\nHow long has it been?”\n“Since the briefing on the Everstorm,” said the man wearing the\npatterned regalia of an Azish vizier. “The year before it arrived. Honestly,\nI’ve missed you all. Mraize, we have Oathgates now. We should meet more\noften.”\n“Meeting is dangerous,” Mraize noted, raising the crossbow to sight at\none of the targets.\n“Mraize, love,” said a woman, Veden like Shallan by her accent, “you\nenjoy danger, don’t you?” Shallan took a Memory of her; aside from the\nvizier she was the only one of the group not in Hoid’s stack of drawings.\n“I enjoy purposeful danger, Icy Tongue,” Mraize said—Shallan knew he\nhad a nickname for everyone. Not a code name, just a quirk of his. “Danger\nwith value and lessons. Foolhardy danger, without purpose, is a waste. A\nwhorehouse for the emotions.”\nHe triggered the crossbow, which shot the larger-than-average bolt into\none of the hay bales.\n“You missed the center, Mraize,” one of the others said.\n“Hence the practice,” Mraize said, reloading the device.\nAs the assassin delivered drinks, Shallan worried what she was expected\nto do. Hopefully not fetch drinks. If she had to ask someone their\npreference, she didn’t like her chances of imitating Iyatil’s accent, which\nshe’d heard only a few times.\nBest for her to avoid saying anything. She prowled along the wall,\nsmoke from one incense burner wafting in her wake.\nIyatil glanced at her.\nPanic erupted in Shallan’s chest, like daggers suddenly slid between her\nribs.\nCalm, Veil reminded.\nShe did her best, maintaining her poise, and picked a spot, then squatted,\nmimicking Iyatil’s posture. Moving had drawn attention, so she determined\nto stay still. Blessedly, that seemed the right move. Iyatil’s attention\nimmediately returned to the group, and the other assassin settled back\nagainst the west wall and watched with folded arms.\n“Is this device the reason we’re all here, risking discovery, Mraize?” Icy\nTongue asked, sipping her drink."

Heavier than a\nnormal crossbow, intended to deliver a payload.”\n“Exactly,” Mraize said, nodding to her. “They were developed to carry\noil or a flaming brand to set fire to enemy sails. Never been terribly\neffective, unfortunately, but they’re enjoyed by some enthusiasts. My father\nhad a few when I was young.” He held up the device, studying it. “A\nmodern weapon, relying on mechanical strength rather than strength of\narm.”\n“It’s obviously difficult to aim,” one of the others said. “I have trouble\nseeing why you’re so interested in it.”\nMraize casually loaded another bolt. Shallan studied him from where she\ncrouched. His actions always had a purpose. What was the lesson here?\nStorms, even when he wasn’t watching her, she felt intimidated by him.\nWorse, she felt an icy chill at the nape of her neck and—despite trying not\nto—glanced at Iyatil. Who had been looking in her direction.\nShallan glanced away immediately, breathing as calmly as she could. An\nanxietyspren appeared anyway, a twisting black cross. Did Iyatil suspect?\nThe spren wasn’t an immediate tell, as one could come because you were\nworried about basically anything, but …\nStorms. Storms, storms, storms. These were experts in the very arts that\nShallan, as Veil, had pretended to know. Sweat ran down her face, and the\nmask suddenly felt heavy and suffocating. Her breath kept getting caught,\nthe heat of it puffing around her cheeks and leaving her skin damp. She\nwanted to rip the mask free.\nDid you notice, Veil said, that he left his trouser leg tucked into his sock?\nShallan glanced again at Mraize, and it was true. In dressing, he’d let his\nright sock catch the back of his trouser leg. In the face of her panic, it was\nan almost comical detail.\nVeil chuckled. He’s just a person, Shallan. They all are. How does\nMraize try to control you?\n“Through intimidation,” she whispered. “Intimidation, secrets, and an air\nof mystery.”\nAnd if you refuse to give him any of those benefits?\nThen …\nJust a person. Iyatil too. People, and highly confident ones, who could\nmake mistakes. They wouldn’t expect Shallan to be here—would never\nassume her capable of taking the face of one of their best.\nEven the most skilled swordswoman, Radiant said, can lose a duel. They\nmight be good, but if they suspected you, they’d have done something by\nnow. You’re doing it.\nYou’re doing it, Veil said. I mean, look how silly he is."

I mean, look how silly he is.\nHe really wasn’t—it was a small mistake, one people commonly made.\nAnd she was in over her head, she knew. But this had to be done, and that\nlittle mistake Mraize had made, it was a sign that he was flawed.\nShallan chuckled softly, and the anxietyspren vanished away.\n“Did you know,” Mraize said to the others, “that on some worlds the\ncrossbow became the default weapon for an entire era of warfare? While the\nweapon is generally slower to reload, it requires less training to use than a\nbow. With the right design it can pierce steel, so instead of the archer who\npractices all their life, or the regal lighteyes in plate armor, such battlefields\nare ruled by the farmers with two months’ training and a technological\nadvantage.”\n“Until a Shardbearer marches through their ranks and lays waste to the\nwhole lot,” said the man in the Alethi uniform. “You know Aladar tried\ncrossbowman ranks once? Sure, they’re powerful—but slow. Best used with\na full pike block for support. And if there’s one man in Plate on the other\nside, those crossbowmen draw him like rain draws vines.”\n“Interesting words, Chain,” Mraize said, sighting with his hand ballista\nand loosing again. “Words spoken with the wisdom of the past—excellent\nat teaching us to deal with the world as it has existed. And only as it has\nexisted.”\nHe looked to Iyatil, who gestured for him to continue. He set the ballista\ndown and opened the front of the podium. A glowing sphere spren floated\nout—much like the seon that Shallan had discovered in her communication\nbox.\nIt changed shape, becoming an older man’s face, with mustaches. Wait\n… did she recognize him?\n“Tell them,” Mraize commanded.\n“We’ve found Restares,” said the floating, glowing head. “He told us,\nand Shallan, the details. Mishram’s prison is hidden in the Spiritual Realm.”\nStorms. That was Felt. One of Adolin’s soldiers.\nColdness enveloped Shallan, accompanied by an overwhelming sense of\ndisconnect. Felt was a spy.\nFelt was a Ghostblood.\nIt was good no one was currently looking at her, because she couldn’t\nkeep the small shockspren away. All that time she’d spent trying to find the\nspy—an entire trip through Shadesmar—only to decide she was herself the\nspy. While Mraize had sent a backup. Of course he had. Storms … she felt\nsuddenly violated, knowing Felt had been watching all along.\n“That’s the important bit,” Felt continued. “Ala has been chatting with\nRestares, who has all kinds of things to say once you press him. Ala’s pretty\nfed up with him, since little of it seems relevant, but I’m taking notes\nanyway.”\nAla? The seon?\nWait …\n“Thank you,” Mraize said. “Ala and you have done well. You will be\ncompensated.”"

On one hand,\nShallan’s sense of betrayal deepened—but on the other, she was relieved.\nThe spren had put up quite an act of being a frightened prisoner, but if that\nwasn’t the case, then maybe Shallan didn’t have to feel so bad for her.\n“I don’t want your rusting coin, Mraize,” Felt said. “I never wanted any\npart of any of this. Though Ala specifically asked me to tell you she wants a\npony. I … I think she might be joking?”\nMraize smiled. “Keep the Herald captive. Further instructions will\ncome.” He made a gesture, and the face faded back to a glowing sphere,\nwhich hid in the podium again.\n“The prison is in the Spiritual Realm?” one of the group said. “So it’s\nimpossible to reach.”\n“Hardly,” Mraize said. “Iyatil and I received intel from a very special\ncontact yesterday, indicating that if we watched Dalinar we would have a\nchance to enter the Spiritual Realm. We thought we might need our newest\nrecruit to nudge him into it, but that wasn’t necessary. Dalinar met with\nCultivation herself, who urged him to seek Honor’s power. He will be\nstepping into the Spiritual Realm soon, and Iyatil and I will follow. Until we\nreturn, Zora, this cell is yours. You will take the seon and report directly to\nMaster Thaidakar.”\nThe Azish vizier nodded.\nThe Thaylen woman he’d called Stolen Purse folded her arms. “You’ve\nnever specifically left someone else in charge before.”\n“This is true,” Mraize said, calmly reloading his hand ballista.\n“So … you think this is dangerous?” the woman continued.\n“I know it is,” Mraize said. “We might not return. Or if we do, hundreds\nof years could have passed here. But we will find Mishram’s prison.”\n“Wait,” said Icy Tongue. “Mraize, how does this help Master\nThaidakar’s plans?”\nMraize didn’t reply, instead sighting his target and loosing. He finally hit\nthe red center circle.\n“We should be working on our plan,” Icy Tongue said, “to transport\nStormlight offworld, now that we know it can be blanked of Identity and\ntransferred between realms. How does chasing down some ancient spren\nfurther Master Thaidakar’s orders to provide him a renewable source of\nInvestiture?”\nShallan leaned forward. She’d already known that the Ghostbloods\nwanted the power of the Radiants and the versatility of Stormlight. That\nexplained a great deal—such as, for example, recruiting Shallan. But there\nwas more. Why was he so interested in Mishram? She reached into her\nsleeve, fingering the spanreed she’d hidden in there, strapped to her arm.\nShe sent three quick flashes—a warning to the others to be ready, but not to\ncome quite yet.

That these hand ballistas were designed to deliver a larger-than-\nnormal payload?\nOh, storms. A gemstone by itself was meaningless. But if he managed to\nget hold of the anti-Stormlight that Navani had developed in Shallan’s\nabsence …\nHe launched the bolt, and hit the target straight on.\nThe wisdom of the past is excellent at teaching us to deal with the world\nas it has existed. And only as it has existed.\nMraize wasn’t showing affection for an old, obsolete piece of\ntechnology. He was practicing with a weapon that, suddenly, could be used\nto kill Radiants—and their spren.\n“Once in the Spiritual Realm,” Mraize said, “Iyatil and I will watch\nDalinar. If we stay close to him, most likely he will lead us to the prison.”\n“How can you know that?” Icy Tongue asked.\n“Because I do,” he said. “Master Thaidakar has approved this course—\nand you eight will lead in our absence. That is all you need know.”\n“Pardon,” said Icy Tongue, “but we’re Ghostbloods. No secrets, Mraize.\nThose are the rules.”\n“Master Thaidakar’s actions,” Mraize said, “prove he does not believe in\nthis rule. Sometimes information is dangerous, and must be kept sheathed\nlike a fine blade.”\nShallan leaned forward farther, but then caught something from the\ncorner of her eye. Iyatil was in motion. The short woman crossed the room\nand stooped beside Shallan, where she whispered something.\nIn a language that Shallan did not recognize.\nDalinar sat with Navani in the garden chamber, both of them in chairs at the\ncenter, facing one another. He held her hands, vines moving around them\nwithout wind or touch. Navani said they were dancing to rhythms Dalinar\ncouldn’t hear.\n“Well?” he asked. “What do you think?”\n“I don’t know, Dalinar,” she said, squeezing his hands. “What happens if\nthis works? Will I lose you?”\n“If I were to Ascend to Honor,” Dalinar said, “I don’t think you’d lose\nme. Cultivation spoke to me earlier, and according to Ash, Honor often\ninteracted with the Heralds.”\n“I don’t mean losing your presence,” she said. “I mean losing you—your\nlove, your humanity. I don’t want to be selfish, and we will do what the\nworld needs. But I have to ask. What will it mean, Dalinar? And does it\nhave to be you?”\nHe didn’t know the answer to either question. They both leaned forward,\nhim resting his forehead on hers. Contemplating. Deciding. Fearspren\nwiggled out of the stones around his feet.\n“All this time,” he whispered, “I’ve been trying to become a better\nperson, Navani.

But also for the way\nshe didn’t immediately agree.\nWit finally returned, slipping in. Dalinar and Navani pulled back from\neach other, and he could see the concern in her eyes.\n“Love,” he said, “we don’t know if this will work. We don’t have to\nmake all the decisions now.”\n“Sometimes,” she said, “it’s good to ask the questions long before you\nneed the answers. I can’t help thinking that we’re dabbling in things well\nbeyond our capacity, Dalinar. The powers of gods? Several of my scholars\ninadvertently detonated themselves just last month, working on anti-Light.\nNow you’re contemplating going somewhere that frightens even Wit.”\n“To be fair,” Wit said, leaning against the wall near the door, “a great\nnumber of things terrify me. I mean, have you considered—really\nconsidered—how insane it is that society entrusts you mortals with\nchildren? After … what, two decades of life, half of it spent in diapers?”\n“Wit,” Navani said, “people don’t spend ten years in diapers.”\n“See?” Wit said. “I’m roughly ten thousand years old, and I barely feel\ncomfortable with my knowledge of how to care for an infant. It’s a wonder\nany of you make it to adolescence …”\n“Focus, Wit,” Dalinar said. “The plan. The Spiritual Realm.”\n“We’re out of our depth,” Navani said. “Like an army struggling against\nan enemy with far more modern equipment.”\n“Or a scholar trying to read complex ideas in a language she has barely\nstudied,” Dalinar added. “But we have only eight days before I need to face\nOdium, and I’m certain the Stormfather is hiding things from me.”\n“The Sibling agrees,” Navani said. “They keep pointing out the\nStormfather’s inaccuracies and our incorrect understanding of historical\nevents.”\n“The goal,” Wit said, “is for you to relive those events. So you can find\nout the truth of Honor’s death, and uncover secrets even I don’t know.” He\nfrowned. “I don’t know why the Stormfather would lie though.”\n“I don’t think … he ever expected anyone to be able to contradict him,”\nDalinar said. “He never thought the Sibling would reawaken.” He met\nNavani’s eyes. “So long as the Heralds are mad and Wit is useless—”\n“Hey!”"

We have to find the\ntruth, Navani. We have to know what happened to Honor.”\n“Which brings us back to the central question,” Navani said softly.\n“What does it mean to replace him?”\n“Dalinar would Ascend,” Wit said. “His mind would expand to see with\nthe eyes of deity. The Shards are not omniscient—it is relatively easy to\nhide things from them. But they are … blessed with a near-infinite capacity\nto understand. To see into the future, in its many permutations, and to\ncomprehend what that means.”\n“It sounds like,” Navani said, “you’d no longer be human.”\n“It sounds like,” Dalinar said, “a version of what has already happened\nto you, with your bond to the tower. We’re working through that. We could\nwork through this.”\nShe nodded hesitantly. “But I ask again: Do you have to do it, Dalinar?\nWhy must it always be you?”\nFrom Jasnah or Adolin, perhaps those words would have been a\nchallenge. A question why he always put himself in the center of the issue.\nHe found such questions ridiculous—who else could he trust with a\nproblem of such magnitude? Someone needed to walk the difficult roads,\nand—as ruler—it was his duty. That was what The Way of Kings taught.\nFrom Navani, it wasn’t a challenge but a plea. If someone was called to\nsacrifice, couldn’t he pass the burden just this once?\n“I can’t trust this to anyone else,” Dalinar said. “You learn, as a general,\nwhen to send your best lieutenant—and when to go yourself.” He squeezed\nher hands. “Navani, if I lose the contest of champions … we lose me. I will\nbe Odium’s, and he will bring out the Blackthorn. Whatever we can do to\nprevent that, I want to try, even if it means this Ascension, as Wit calls it. If,\nafter the contest, the power is changing me too much, I will find another\nand give it to them.”\n“Is that allowed?” she asked, glancing to Wit.\n“Technically, yes,” he said. “But it is extremely difficult to do. Once you\nare a god, Dalinar, it is nearly impossible to let go.”\n“Surely it has been done,” Dalinar said.\nWit grew distant, a faint smile on his lips. “Once. It wasn’t a full\nAscension, but a mortal did give up the power once. It proved to be the\nwrong choice, but it was the most selfless thing I believe I’ve ever\nwitnessed. So yes, Dalinar, it is possible. But not easy.”\n“Nothing ever is,” he said. “Not for us.”\nNavani looked back at him, then nodded. “Very well. Let’s do it then.\nTogether.”\n“… Together?”\n“I’m not going to let you go into the realm of the gods alone,” she said.\n“You’ll need a scholar to help interpret what you see in the past.”\nDamnation.

But if it was going to be as dangerous as Wit implied …\nNo. From her expression, he knew that if he suggested taking another\nscholar instead of her, he would bring down a wrath to make the\nStormfather look like a spring squall. And justly so. For all the same\narguments he’d made to himself about doing this personally, he needed the\nbest at his side. That was Navani.\n“You are wise,” he said. “I hate it, but you are right. We’ll try this\ntogether. But we’ll need to prepare the others to lead Urithiru while we are\ngone. Wit thinks it will take us days to accomplish this.”\n“I can keep an eye on things here,” Wit said. “First, we’ll have you peek\ninto the Spiritual Realm and see if this even works. If you leave your bodies\nbehind, as I’m hoping, I should be able to bring you back out if you’re\nneeded.”\n“Excellent,” Navani said. “How do we proceed?”\n“Well,” Wit said, “you once had to use a highstorm and the Stormfather’s\npowers—but you’re Bondsmiths now. You can open a perpendicularity and\npush into the Spiritual Realm. Once there, I suggest using Connection to\nguide you into a specific slice of the past. I’ll help you with that. You can\npeek into an event I’ve witnessed, experience it, and return so we can\ncompare notes. If that works, we can send you on a longer journey, into\ntimes I wasn’t here to witness.”\nDalinar and Navani met each other’s eyes and nodded.\n“Great,” Wit said. “Let’s head down the elevator and find a good\nlocation to try the experiment.”\n“Why not here?” Dalinar asked.\n“You are about to pierce through the three realms and try to throw\nyourselves into the Spiritual Realm,” Wit said. “If you get it wrong, you’ll\nend up in Shadesmar—but with the force you’re using, you could as easily\ncast yourselves beyond the tower. Personally, I’d feel more comfortable if\nwe were somewhere lower, so you had less distance to fall if things go\nawry.”\n“Very well,” Dalinar said, standing. “Let’s tell Aladar and Sebarial what\nwe’re planning, just in case, then find somewhere lower down for the\nexperiment.”\nI continued on my way, contemplating dust and the nature of\ndesertion. For I, as king, had walked away from my duties, and it\nwas different for me. Had I not renounced a throne the Almighty\nhad granted, and in so doing, undermined my very own words?\nWas I abandoning that which was divinely given me?\n—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable\nShallan stared at Iyatil. The woman’s eyes seemed distant behind that mask,\nand strangely human—as if the mask were some beast that had swallowed a\nperson.\nIyatil repeated her comment in, presumably, their native tongue. In a\npanic, Shallan reached for the spanreed in her sleeve, ready to call the\nothers. Only … she hadn’t actually learned anything yet. How were the\nGhostbloods going to sneak through to the Spiritual Realm with Dalinar?"

How were the\nGhostbloods going to sneak through to the Spiritual Realm with Dalinar?\nWhy were they so interested in one of the Unmade? They’d already made\ncontact with Sja-anat. Wasn’t that enough?\nThere was no helping it. If Iyatil hadn’t been suspicious before, she\nwould be when she got no reply. Shallan gripped the spanreed.\nBut Veil whispered: You can do this, Shallan. Try.\nShallan couldn’t understand what Iyatil had said, but what was her body\nlanguage saying? Iyatil nodded to the side, toward the third masked\noffworlder. Her words had been short and terse, maybe a question, more\nlikely an order. So, risking it, Shallan gave a curt nod.\nThat worked, and Iyatil scurried back toward the doorway in the eastern\nwall, Shallan following. The third assassin met them, and they huddled\ntogether, with Iyatil speaking quickly in their own language. In the center of\nthe room, Mraize hinted to the others what Shallan had guessed: that with\nsome minor tweaks, the hand ballista would be very useful in coming years.\nShallan couldn’t pay attention to him, for she had now gotten herself into\na conversation with not merely one person speaking another tongue, but\ntwo. They’d expect a response other than a nod. She had to escape the\nconversation without making a scene.\nFind an excuse, Veil whispered, for not paying attention.\nYes … distractibility was a universal human foible. Unfortunately there\nwasn’t much in the room. Just the targets, Mraize and his crew, four bleak\nstone walls …\nWait. The doorknob. Silvery, polished, reflective. Being crouched down\ntogether as they were put it near eye level. Shallan fixated on it, waiting\nuntil the others noticed her distraction.\n“Aleen?” Iyatil said to Shallan. “Aleen, vat ist erest missen?”\nShallan pointed at the doorknob and spoke, whispering a word that\nwould be the same regardless of language. “Sja-anat.” The whisper\nhopefully masked her voice.\nIyatil hissed softly, pushing Shallan aside to look closely at the\ndoorknob. When she saw nothing, she grunted, and—ignoring their\nconversation—stalked toward Mraize. The other foreigner glanced at\nShallan, so she shrugged, then leaned in to study the doorknob. He moved\noff after Iyatil.\nShallan calmed her nerves, avoiding drawing a spren this time. Iyatil had\ntaken the bait, and hadn’t seemed to find anything too irregular about\nShallan. Unless she was telling Mraize she was an impostor right now.\nMaybe it was time to call the others. Shallan reached again for her\nspanreed, but a moment later a shadow moved across the doorknob, and\nthen Sja-anat appeared as she had earlier: a jet-black female figure with\nwhite holes for eyes.\nI wondered, she said in Shallan’s mind, how you would manage without\nspeaking her tongue, Shallan. That was clever."

That was clever.\n“So you do know it’s me,” Shallan whispered.\nIt is difficult for mortals to distinguish one soul’s flame from another, but\nI am not mortal.\n“Are you going to reveal me?”\nAs you just revealed me? Perhaps.\n“Whose side are you on, Sja-anat?” Shallan whispered. “Truly. What is\nyour game?”\nGame, Shallan? I fight for survival. Odium will rip through anyone,\nanything, to get what he wishes. Thousands of years have proven he cares\nnothing for me or my children. Honor is a coward who always hated us.\nDestroyed us. Betrayed us. And all Cultivation does is watch.\nI am on the side of preserving a world for my children. You should not\nfear “my side,” Shallan. You should embrace it. If there is room for my\nchildren, there will be room for yours.\nIyatil returned, Mraize tailing her. Again Shallan gripped the spanreed\nbut held her nerve. Sja-anat did not hide, but persisted—small, but\ndistinguishable, as a reflection in the doorknob, looking up at Iyatil.\n“Lieke, stay here,” Iyatil said in Alethi. “Entertain the others.” She\nopened the door, grabbing the doorknob despite the reflection there. Mraize\nfollowed, as did Shallan, assuming that Lieke was the other masked figure.\nShade and the actor were gone from this little alcove. It was darker in\nhere, where the sole light was provided by chips—painted on one side, to\nshine only on Mraize’s treasures.\n“There,” Iyatil said. “My trophy case. I see her reflection.”\nWait … her trophy case? It wasn’t Mraize’s?\nIyatil pulled a mirror out on wheels from behind one of the cabinets.\nShallan closed the door to the other room softly, then stayed back, trying\nnot to draw attention.\nSja-anat appeared in the mirror, all slender smoke and magnetic eyes.\n“Why are you here?” Iyatil demanded. “You’re supposed to be watching\nthe Bondsmiths. Have they begun the process?”\n“My children watch,” Sja-anat said, her voice tinny and small, as if she\nwere communicating down the length of a long hallway. “The Sibling is\nawake. They are not easy to fool, even for me. I myself would draw\nattention.”\n“This isn’t what you told us,” Iyatil said. “The timing will be tight. We\nneed to get into Shadesmar and be ready to enter Dalinar’s perpendicularity\nas soon as it opens.”\n“You will not miss your opportunity,” Sja-anat said. “Though I question\nyour eagerness to be lost in that place.”\n“You said our spren could guide us,” Mraize said, stepping closer to the\nmirror. “You said they understood that realm.”\nOur spren?\nOur spren?\nShallan backed up a pace, pressing against the cold stone wall. Mraize\nand Iyatil had spren? They were Radiant?"

        "text": "Our spren?\nOur spren?\nShallan backed up a pace, pressing against the cold stone wall. Mraize\nand Iyatil had spren? They were Radiant?\nThat’s why they were so eager to meet Sja-anat! Veil said. Sja-anat’s\nrequirements for those who bonded her children were different from those\nof ordinary Radiants.\nStorms. Shallan had been key to facilitating Sja-anat meeting with the\nGhostbloods. She’d known all along that her flirtatious half-commitment to\nthe Ghostbloods was dangerous. Here was proof. Why had she let it go on\nfor so long?\nYou were confused, Radiant said, far from home, and you thought Jasnah\nwas dead. You needed to feel a part of something. Do not be too hard on\nyourself.\nShallan had made many mistakes, yes, but she hoped she was learning\nfrom them. Today she stepped forward, closer to Iyatil and Mraize, hoping\nto catch signs of their spren—to tell what orders they had joined. Or … if\nthey had bonded Sja-anat’s children, were they actually Radiants? Renarin\nwas, but he’d chosen to take the title for himself.\nIn her shock, she’d missed some of what Sja-anat was saying.\nAssurances that her children could offer guidance in the Spiritual Realm.\n“There is only so much that can be done for mortals,” the Unmade\ncontinued. “Like a fish suddenly on the land, you will be in a place that is\nhostile to your existence. My children will guide you, but you still may not\nreturn.”\n“We will go regardless,” Mraize said softly.\n“And I am glad,” Sja-anat said. “One last warning, however. I do not\nthink you will find an ally in my sister. Mishram is not … fond of humans.”\n“We are not seeking an ally,” Iyatil said. “Tell us when Dalinar starts\ngetting ready, so we may prepare.”\n“As you wish,” Sja-anat said. “My children say he is talking to his\nadvisors. He is close though.”\n“What of Shallan?” Mraize asked. “Does she hunt us?”\n“She does,” Sja-anat said. And did not look toward Shallan standing\nbehind them.\nShallan didn’t spot a spren on Mraize’s clothing or shoulder, but she did\nnote the quiver of crossbow bolts at his side. Specifically, one had a\ngemstone affixed with white-blue light that warped the air around it.\nShallan hadn’t seen the anti-Light, but Wit had told her about it, and she\nrecognized it from the description.\nMraize, as ever, had worked quickly and efficiently. So far as Shallan\nknew, there was barely a tiny bit of the stuff in Urithiru, carefully locked\naway. Yet Mraize had already stolen some. She couldn’t help but be\nimpressed.\n“I’m worried Shallan will interfere,” he said.\n“The girl is distracted,” Iyatil said. “You fixate upon her too much,\nacolyte. We made the proper threats; her attention will be on protecting and\nwatching her loved ones.”\n“Yes, Babsk,” Mraize said.\nThey’re human, Veil whispered. Fallible. Remember that."

        "text": "watching her loved ones.”\n“Yes, Babsk,” Mraize said.\nThey’re human, Veil whispered. Fallible. Remember that.\nIyatil waved Mraize off, and he bowed to her. It felt strange to see him\ndefer; he had always seemed so in command. Though there was a level of\nself-control to his obedience. Mraize did not complain or seem upset to be\ndismissed. He walked with his head held high, opening the door to reveal\nthe Ghostbloods practicing with his oversized crossbow.\nSja-anat vanished, and Shallan followed Mraize, trying not to be trapped\nwith Iyatil. Unfortunately, the woman put her hand up to stop Shallan.\n“Something is wrong with him,” Iyatil said softly. “I do not think he has\nbeen replaced with a duplicate, but I do question his loyalty to our cause.”\nThankfully, the words were in Alethi. Perhaps because she’d just been\nspeaking to Sja-anat in that tongue, and continued on momentum. Perhaps it\nwas because in this room, away from the others, she didn’t worry about\nbeing overheard. Or perhaps with Sja-anat around … she wanted to be?\nIyatil still focused on Mraize, thoughtful. “I’ve spent so long training\nhim. It is natural for him to want his own acolytes. But he thinks solely of\nhis own advancement, and not the greater purpose.”\nShallan needed to push. She needed answers. She found herself speaking\nin a whisper. “Thaidakar’s purpose.”\n“Master Thaidakar will see eventually,” Iyatil said. “He is smarter than\nyou give him credit for. He works to protect his homeland above all else,\nbut once we find Mishram for my purposes, he will see. Master Thaidakar\ncan only protect his land if the Shards can be controlled. Will this fit your\nplans as well?”\nStay silent? Or speak? Which was more suspicious?\nIyatil looked at her, waiting. Shallan sweated, and tried giving a nod\nagain.\n“That’s it?” Iyatil said. “You’ve been so …”\nShe focused on Shallan, eyes widening behind her mask. Shockspren\nexploded around her. Damnation. That was it.\nIyatil lunged, and Shallan caught the hand, expecting a knife—but Iyatil\nwasn’t attacking. She was reaching for Shallan’s hood, and in her deflection\nShallan knocked it aside, revealing her wig.\nIyatil hissed, then shouted, scrambling backward, “Radiants! We are\ndiscovered!”\nTWENTY-SIX YEARS AGO\nSzeth’s father, Neturo-son-Vallano, knelt beside the new stone. Szeth’s\nmother, Zeenid-daughter-Beth, was overseeing painting classes in the town,\nso they’d sent her a message via Tek, one of their carrier parrots. Wind blew\nacross them, bringing with it the pungent scent of the gathered sheep in the\nnearby pasture.\nSzeth hid behind his father, peeking out.

He loved their rock, and a new one was surely\ncause for celebration, but shamefully … he wished he hadn’t found it.\nSomething new meant possible celebration, possible attention, possible\nchange. He preferred quiet days full of languid breezes and bleating sheep.\nNights beside the hearth or the firepit, listening to Mother tell stories. He\ndidn’t want some grand new thing. Szeth had what he loved.\n“What do we do, Father?” Elid asked. “Call the Stone Shamans?”\n“It depends,” he said. “Depends.”\nTheir father was a calm man, with a long beard he liked to keep tied with\na green ribbon at the bottom, matching ones on his arms, together forming\nhis splash. He got to wear three, as his duty of training other shepherds\nelevated him. His head was shaded by his customary tall reed hat with a\nwide brim, and he had a bit of a paunch that spoke to his talent as a cook.\nHe had all the answers. Always.\n“What about it is uncertain, Father?” Szeth said, peeking around at the\nlittle stone. “We just do what is right.”\nFather glanced at their larger stone, then at this one. “A single rock is a\nblessed anomaly. Two … might mean more. It might mean the spren have\nchosen this region.”\n“What do you mean?” Elid asked, hands on her hips.\n“I mean there might be other rocks,” Father said, “hiding beneath the\nsurface here. Stone Shamans will want to set aside the entire region,\npreserve it and watch it for a few years to see if anything else emerges.”\n“And … us?” Szeth asked.\n“Well, we’ll have to move,” Father replied. “Tear down the house, in\ncase it’s accidentally on holy ground. Set up wherever the Farmer finds land\nfor us. Maybe in the town.”\nIn the town? Szeth turned, looking into the distance—though the rolling\nhills prevented him from seeing Clearmount unless he climbed up on top of\none. It was close enough to walk to in an hour or so, but he found the place\nnoisy, congested. In the town, it felt like the mountains weren’t just around\nthe corner, because buildings blocked them out. It felt like the meadows had\ngone brown, replaced by dull roads. You couldn’t smell the sea breezes.\nHe didn’t hate the town. But he got the sense that it hated the things he\nloved.\n“I don’t want to move!” Elid said. “We found a rock! We shouldn’t be\npunished.”\n“If it’s right though,” Szeth said, “then we have to do it. Right, Father?”\nFather stood up, pulling at his trousers, and waited. Soon Szeth picked\nout his mother hurrying along the path between hills toward their home. She\nwore a long green skirt as her splash—while it was only one piece, that size\n… well, it was an audacious amount for her station. She had a white apron\nover the front, and curly light brown hair that bunched up around her head\nlike a cloud.\nShe was carrying one of the town’s shovels—a relic crafted from metal\nthat had never seen rock, Soulcast by an Honorbearer and gifted to them."

That couldn’t mean …\nMother hurried up to them, shovel on her shoulder. Father nodded\ntoward the new rock, and Mother let out a relieved sigh. “So small? Your\nnote had me worried, Neturo.”\n“Mother?” Szeth said. “What are you doing?”\n“Merely a quick relocation,” she said. “I borrowed one of the shovels,\nbut didn’t tell anyone why. We’ll dig up the rock and move it a few hundred\nyards. Let it rain a little, so it seems to have naturally poked up, then tell\neveryone.”\nSzeth gasped. “We can’t touch it!”\nMother pulled out a pair of gloves. “Of course not. That’s why I brought\ngloves, dear.”\n“That’s the same thing!” Szeth said, horrified. He looked to his father.\n“We can’t do this, can we?”\nFather scratched at his beard. “Depends, I suppose, on what you think,\nson.”\n“Me?”\n“You found the rock,” Father said, glancing at Mother, who nodded in\nagreement. “So you can decide.”\n“I choose whatever is right,” Szeth said immediately.\n“Is it right for us to lose our home?” Father asked.\n“I …” Szeth glanced at the house.\n“There might be dozens of rocks underneath here,” Father said. “If that’s\nthe case, then we should absolutely move. But in the hundreds of years that\nrain has fallen on this region, only two have emerged. So it’s unlikely.\nMoving the stone a few hundred yards will still make the shamans watch\nthis area, but with the rocks being farther apart, the worry will be more\nnebulous. But that requires us to move it. In secret.”\n“We hate the stonewalkers,” Szeth said, “because of how they treat\nrock.”\nFather knelt down, one hand on Szeth’s shoulder. “We don’t hate them.\nThey simply don’t know the right way of things.”\n“They raid us, Father,” Elid said, folding her arms.\n“Yes, well,” he said. “Those men are evil, but it’s not because they live\nin a place with too much stone. It’s because of the choices they make.” He\nsmiled at Szeth. “It’s okay, son. If you want us to turn this in now, well,\nwe’ll do it.”\n“Can’t you just … tell me what to do?” Szeth asked.\n“No, I don’t think that I can,” Father said. “Unfair to put you in this spot,\nI know, but the spren gave you the first sight. You should decide. We can\nmove the rock, or we can move our home. I’ll accept either one.”\n“Maybe we should let him sleep on it,” Mother said.\n“No,” Szeth said. “No. We can … move the rock.”\nAll three of them relaxed as he said it, and he felt a sudden—shameful—\nresentment.

Didn’t they see that made this his\nfault?\nMother pulled on her gloves and started digging. Szeth winced each time\nthe shovel scraped the stone. That metallic sound was not natural. He hoped\nthat they would discover the rock was enormous—so that the plan had to be\nabandoned. In the end, it was small. Eight inches long, and a dull grey\ncolor. He could have held it in one hand, if he’d wanted.\nMolli the ewe, seeming to sense his tension, rubbed up against him and\nhe gripped at her wool, her warmth. Even Mother seemed a little unsure,\nnow that she’d dug the rock out. She stepped back, leaving it in the hole.\n“You scraped it,” Elid said. “That seems … kind of obvious.”\n“Once we’ve buried it again,” Mother said, “nobody will see the\nscrapes.”\n“How much trouble would we be in,” Elid asked, “if someone found\nout?”\n“I suspect the Farmer wouldn’t be happy,” Father said. He laughed then,\nand it sounded genuine. “Might require some cake to make up for it. Don’t\nget that look, Szeth. We show devotion because we choose to. And so, the\nkind of devotion we make is ours to decide.”\n“I … don’t understand,” he said. “Don’t the Stone Shamans tell us what\nto do?”\n“They share the teachings of the spren,” Mother said, as she shouldered\nthe shovel. “But we interpret those teachings. What we’re doing here today\nis reverent enough for me.”\nSzeth thought on that and wondered—as this was not the first clue in his\nlife—if perhaps this was why they chose to live outside the town. Many\nshepherd families lived at least part of the year inside it. His family visited\neach month for devotions, so he didn’t dare think that his family wasn’t\nfaithful. Yet the older he got, the more questions he had.\nHow did he feel about his parents doing something he knew the shamans\nwouldn’t approve of?\nThey were still all standing there, staring at the rock, when the horns\nsounded. Father looked up, then whispered a soft prayer to the spren of their\nstone. The horns meant raiders on the southern coast. Stonewalkers.\nSzeth felt an immediate panic. “What do we do?”\n“Gather the sheep,” Father said. “Quickly. We must drive them toward\nDison’s Valley on the other side of the town. The Farmer has troops in the\nregion. We’ll be safe inland.”\n“But this?” Szeth said, gesturing to the rock. “This!”\nMother, suddenly determined, reached down and grabbed it in her\ngloved hands.

But let me teach a truth\nhere that is often misunderstood: sometimes, it is not weakness,\nbut strength, to stand up and walk away.\n—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable\nIyatil ran for the larger room, giving Shallan time to reach into her sleeve\nand activate the spanreed strapped to her arm. A long press, locked into\nposition, which would make the ruby on the other spanreed pulse—\nindicating an emergency.\nShallan turned to run up the steps.\nRadiant stopped her. She’d fooled Mraize and Iyatil. She’d done it. They\nwere just people. Deadly, capable, manipulative. But people. In some ways\nless capable than Shallan, for if they genuinely had spren, they were very\nnew to them. Perhaps barely a few days into their bonding.\nInstead of running, Radiant ripped away the stupid wig and mask.\n“Armor,” she commanded.\nShallan!\nIt encased her in a heartbeat, a bright glow from the front of her visor\nilluminating the room. Pattern followed at her summons, a brilliant, silvery\nsword. And Testament?\nShe would not ask Testament to kill again. Shallan reached her left arm\nto the side, and Testament appeared as a powerful shield, affixed to her arm,\nlight as a cloth glyphward.\nShallan was no longer a child, confused, terrified, forced to kill with a\ngifted necklace. She had spoken Truth. And today she was the Radiant\nshe’d once only imagined.\nFrom the larger room with the bales of hay, Iyatil shouted to the others.\n“The Lightweaver is here! She was impersonating Aleen!”\nRadiant stepped through the doorway, checking the corners. She leveled\nher weapon at Lieke, who had been right inside. He fled backward, stepping\non purple fearspren. Radiant didn’t blame him. Facing a Shardbearer\nwithout Shards was not a wise proposition. Unless you were a storm-faced\nbridgeman, of course.\nAcross the room, Mraize took her in, then smiled. Storm him, he was\nproud of her. He calmly raised his hand ballista and shot a normal, non-lit\nbolt. She deflected it easily with her shield, and was struck by a new fear.\nWhat would happen if anti-Light met a Shardweapon?\nStorms, they were in unknown territory."

She deflected it easily with her shield, and was struck by a new fear.\nWhat would happen if anti-Light met a Shardweapon?\nStorms, they were in unknown territory.\nIyatil ripped the ballista out of Mraize’s hands. Nearby, the other\nGhostbloods were doing themselves credit. When Shallan had pulled\nsimilar operations on groups like the Sons of Honor, there had been mass\nchaos. The Ghostbloods moved with deliberate coordination, spreading out,\ntwo summoning Shardblades, others producing conventional weapons.\nIyatil moved quickest of all, explaining why she’d retreated instead of\nengaging Shallan. Stabbing a Knight Radiant was basically useless; she\nneeded something stronger. Iyatil pulled a bolt from Mraize’s pouch and\nraised a now-cocked ballista with it loaded, glowing bright. While Mraize\nhad chosen a conventional bolt, Iyatil would shoot anti-Stormlight.\nShallan ducked back into the trophy room. She glanced over her\nshoulder and saw the Ghostbloods retreating toward the west side of the\nlarge chamber. Storms, of course they’d have another exit. There was no\nway in Damnation’s cold winds they would trap themselves—which meant\nshe couldn’t just hold this room and wait for the others.\nShe stepped into the doorway and shouted, “Mraize!”\nHer helmet amplified the sound, as if she’d spoken with ten times the\nforce. Wow.\nShallan! the armor said, somehow conveying You’re welcome.\nMraize stopped retreating and turned toward her.\n“Would you become the prey?” she demanded. “Running before the\naxehound?”\n“Even a master hunter hides from the storm,” he called back. “I will face\nyou when it is time, little knife.”\n“Why not now?” she asked, advancing. Iyatil was pulling on Mraize’s\narm to flee, ballista lowered to her side. Lieke opened a hidden door in the\nwest wall. The others went through—one at a time, no pushing.\nShallan held her hands to the sides, dismissing both Pattern and\nTestament. “Go find the others; see what is taking them so long,” she\nwhispered to the spren. She could resummon them, but didn’t want to risk\nthem if that bolt was loosed.\nIyatil trained the ballista on her, but did not shoot. She knew she had\nexactly one shot. The others were escaping, but so long as Iyatil and Mraize\nwere focused on Shallan, she bought time for the strike force to arrive.\n“I’ve seen Mishram,” Shallan said. “Lightning in her eyes. Hair like\nmidnight. I’ve seen her.”\nThat did it. The two fixated on her even more squarely.\n“Mishram is imprisoned,” Iyatil said.\n“Can any prison truly hold a god?” Shallan said, stepping forward.\n“Whatever advantage you think you can gain from her, you’re wrong. She\nis malevolent and terrible, the essence of hatred, imprisoned for two\nthousand years. She will destroy you, Mraize. Whatever your plan, it is not\nworth the risk.”\nMraize clasped his hands behind his back, studying her. Her argument"

        "text": "thousand years. She will destroy you, Mraize. Whatever your plan, it is not\nworth the risk.”\nMraize clasped his hands behind his back, studying her. Her argument\nwasn’t a good one—Mraize was willing to make big wagers, and was not\ndriven by fear—but it was all she’d been able to come up with on the spot.\nStill, he studied Radiant. Was he thinking about what she’d said …\nNo, Veil thought. He’s thinking how we surprised him by sneaking in\nhere. And how bold we are to stand here, staring down that weapon.\n“We don’t have to be enemies,” she said to him.\n“You aren’t my enemy,” he said. “You’re my obstacle.”\nIyatil shifted.\nShe’s going to shoot.\nShallan dove to the side while breathing out and purposely ejecting all of\nher Stormlight. With some, she created two illusions: one of her jumping in\nthe other direction, another staying in place.\nIyatil tracked the correct Shallan, then loosed.\nGo! Shallan commanded the armor.\nShallan? the spren sent, but obeyed, vanishing right as the crossbow bolt\ntook her in the ribs. She tumbled in her dive, grunting at the sudden jolt of\npain. She almost drew in Stormlight, but forcibly stopped herself. No. No.\nThe bolt had a metal tip, with a gemstone clipped into the shaft. That tip\n… it was designed, like the weapons of the Fused, to move Light. In this\ncase, it injected the anti-Light, making it seep through her. It wasn’t painful,\nnot compared to the actual wound, but it was wrong. A cold that prowled\nthrough her veins, carried through her body with every beat of her heart.\nPainspren clawed up from the stone ground around her. This feeling was\nunnatural, counter to her very nature, but … she felt she could have drawn\nit in like normal Light. She decided not to try, as it did not seem to be able\nto hurt her so long as she set her jaw against the pain and refused the\nnormal Stormlight that would heal her. Because if those two met …\nThrough tears of pain, Shallan watched Mraize take Iyatil by the arm and\ngesture toward the exit. She instead pulled a knife from its sheath at her belt\nand moved toward Shallan.\nThen, blessedly, something distracted them. Shouts from the hidden\nhallway?\nThe ceiling in the center of the room—between Shallan and the other\ntwo—melted.\nStone in a hole maybe eight feet across poured down, as if it had\nsuddenly become mud. It splashed on the floor of the cavern—missing the\npodium by inches and touching none of the people—then instantly\nhardened. Through that hole came a dozen Windrunners one after another—\nthe last carrying Erinor, Darcira’s husband, a Stoneward. That explained the\nmeltiness.\nHand on her wound—bloodied fingers around the crossbow bolt—\nShallan met Mraize’s eyes.\nThen he, Iyatil, and Lieke—who had been lingering—vanished. The air\naround them warped with a light tinged black-violet, and they were gone."

The air\naround them warped with a light tinged black-violet, and they were gone.\nSzeth trailed off, having told Kaladin a little about his family as they\nwalked through the forest for a few hours. A story of the discovery of a\nrock, told in fits and starts. Kaladin hadn’t interrupted, enjoying hearing the\nother man open up—plus, learning about the Shin was genuinely\ninteresting.\nThis time when Szeth trailed off, he didn’t continue.\n“You heard a horn?” Kaladin eventually prompted. “What did that\nmean?”\n“I’m done for now,” Szeth said.\nKaladin sighed, but otherwise contained his annoyance. At least that\nstory had been something. They soon reached a sharp drop-off. Here the\ntrail wound down in a series of steep switchbacks, so they took a quick\njaunt into the sky. Kaladin felt invigorated, bathed in the light of a sun that\nhad passed its zenith and was now working toward the horizon.\n“Do you have forests near your home?” Szeth asked as they lazily drifted\ndown, skimming the tops of the foliage.\n“Not like this,” Kaladin said. “I didn’t see a true forest until I reached the\nShattered Plains, and took a trip to the harvesting operations a half day’s\nmarch north.”\n“I always thought there couldn’t be trees outside Shinovar,” Szeth said,\nStormlight escaping his lips. “How could they grow in a land with no soil?”\n“And I,” Kaladin said, “never imagined you’d have them here. With\nnothing for their roots to grip.”\nSzeth grunted at that, then Lashed himself in a steady swoop along the\nmountainside. Kaladin followed as the trees dwindled, and they approached\nShinovar proper: a vast plain of vibrant green. Kaladin had seen many a\nfield before, but he realized that up until this moment, he’d never seen\nsomething so alive as this prairie. Though again, there were no lifespren,\nwhich he found odd.\nRegardless, fields back home had grass, but with more space between\nthe blades, so the brown cremstone filtered through. Here the grass grew\nlike moss, achieving an aggressive density. As if the individual blades had\nformed mobs, armies, pike blocks.\nFollowing Szeth, he landed on an outcropping on the slope. As Szeth sat\ndown to inspect the land before them, Kaladin walked to the edge, his\nStormlight giving out, and his full weight settled on him, his feet sinking\ninto the soft soil to an unfamiliar degree. The entire view—with the rolling\nhills of green and a thick blanket of grass—made him think of an ocean.\nEach of those hills a swell or wave, with trees like ships. There was even\nwhat he thought might be a herd of wild horses in the distance. Incredible.\n“I see it now,” Kaladin whispered.\n“What?” Szeth asked.\n“I see how your land survives. That grass … it doesn’t move, doesn’t\nreact. Yet it feels as if it could swallow everything. Like it wants to\nconsume me.”\n“It will, once you die,” Szeth said softly. “It will take all of us.\nUndoubtedly later than we deserve.”"

Like it wants to\nconsume me.”\n“It will, once you die,” Szeth said softly. “It will take all of us.\nUndoubtedly later than we deserve.”\nWhat a delightful way of thinking. Syl landed next to Kaladin, becoming\nfull sized and trimmed in violet. She was grinning, naturally. “Look at the\nsolitary trees!” she said, pointing. “Look at them just sitting there alone,\nwithout a care in the world.”\nHere, trees didn’t need companions with whom to lock roots. But\nKaladin, now that he thought to look closer, found the buildings more\nunusual. This region wasn’t terribly well populated, but he picked out one\ntown, maybe the size of Hearthstone—and several lonely homesteads.\nThose buildings seemed so unprotected, practically shouting for the\nstorms to take them. Though they were distant, he thought they were\nwooden, and appeared flimsy. With flat walls to the east, and windows on\nthose sides as well. He knew people here didn’t have to fight the storms, but\nthose homes unnerved him. Made him think the people must be weak,\ninnocent, in need of protection. Like lost children wandering a battlefield.\n“This is wrong,” Szeth said.\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said, kneeling beside him in the knee-high grass. “How\ndo people live here?”\n“Peacefully, when your kind let them,” Szeth said, his eyes narrowed. He\nsat somewhat awkwardly, the strange black sword strapped to his back. It\nwas a good example of why one normally summoned a Shardblade, instead\nof carrying it. The weapon was awkwardly sized: too long to be worn at the\nwaist, but difficult to draw when strapped to the back like that.\nSzeth glanced at him and shook his head. “Something is wrong here. Not\nthe things you see with a stonewalker’s perspective, Kaladin. Look. Does\nthat region seem … darker than it should?”\nKaladin followed Szeth’s pointing finger to a rise on the right, along the\ncliffsides of the mountain. It was darker than the stones and soil around it.\nBut … there was no visible cloud to cause that shadow. Kaladin narrowed\nhis eyes and thought he could see wisps of blackness rising from it.\n“What’s over there?” Kaladin asked.\n“The monastery,” Szeth said. “We have ten of them. Most are homes of\nthe Honorblades.”\nThe legendary weapons of the Heralds. Szeth had wielded one when\nkilling old King Gavilar. It, unfortunately, had fallen into other hands … the\nhands of a man who should have been Kaladin’s brother.\n“You keep the Honorblades in monasteries?” Kaladin asked.\n“One for each Radiant order, though Talmut’s is missing, of course, as is\nNin’s. Ishu has claimed his too, now. Regardless, when a person is elevated\nas I was in my youth, they travel to each monastery on pilgrimage, training\nat those that have an Honorblade, mastering each Surge. That one ahead is\nthe first I lived in, but it has no Blade.”\n“Which one is it?” Syl asked from the edge of their overlook, gazing\nstraight along the mountainside to that distant fortress on the ridge. “Which\nBlade should it have held?”"

Stonesinew, the\nBearer of Agonies.”\n“That darkness,” Kaladin said, “reminds me of the darkness around the\nKholinar palace. An Unmade lived there. You really met one here, in\nShinovar?”\n“Yes,” Szeth said softly.\n“When was this?” Kaladin said. “After you discovered a rock on your\nfamily’s ground?” He hoped to prompt more of the story.\n“The meeting was much later,” Szeth said, “but that day with the rock,\nand the raid … that was the beginning.”\n“Do you want to tell me more?” Kaladin asked.\n“None of that matters. All that matters is the quest.”\n“And the people, your family, the—”\n“None of it matters,” Szeth repeated. “We should camp here for the night\nand visit the monastery in the morning. Unless you want to investigate that\nplace now.”\nKaladin shoved aside his annoyance at Szeth and looked again at the\npatch of darkness. Then he glanced at the sun, which was getting close to\nsetting. He wasn’t certain how all this connected—Ishar, Dalinar’s request\nof him, and Szeth’s story. But if there was an Unmade, he didn’t want to\nrisk encountering it at night. Kaladin had faced them at Kholinar, where\nhe’d failed to protect the people. Even the Unmade he’d eventually defeated\n—when it had worn Amaram’s body—had been extremely dangerous.\n“Camping sounds good,” Kaladin said. “But let’s do it farther back and\naround that bend, to shelter the cookfire.”\n“We don’t need a cookfire,” Szeth said. “We have travel rations.”\nKaladin insisted, however. Thankfully Szeth joined him, and offered no\nfurther complaint about a cookfire. Because Kaladin needed this man to\nopen up.\nAnd he figured he’d try an old standby.\nThose who offer blanket condemnation are fools, for each\nsituation deserves its own consideration, and rarely can you\nsimply apply a saying—even one of mine—to a situation without\nserious weighing of the context.\n—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable\nShallan’s jaw dropped as she lay on the floor of the Ghostblood hideout.\nShe stared, like an eel gasping for breath, at the space where Mraize and the\nothers had vanished.

For now, she held her\nbloodied side as Windrunners secured the room, several of them going after\nthe Ghostbloods who had escaped.\n“Shallan!” Darcira said, kneeling by her. Shallan hadn’t seen the other\nLightweaver enter. “You’re hurt! How? You didn’t summon your armor?”\n“Anti-Light,” Shallan said with a grunt. “I couldn’t afford to let it hit the\narmor—don’t know what it will do to the spren.” She grimaced. “The bolt\nwent in too low to hit my lung, otherwise I’d be coughing blood all over the\nfloor. Grazed between my ribs though—I can feel it.” Shallan braced\nherself. “Pull it out. It’s injecting anti-Stormlight.”\nThe other woman did so, and Shallan squeezed her eyes shut against the\nagony. She breathed in and out, shallow breaths to control the pain, and\ncontinued to feel that coldness in her veins. The anti-Light pulsed with a\nstrange, off-key sound. Like the scrape of bone on rock. It faded slowly.\nShe opened her eyes and could see it evaporating from her skin, along\nwith the painspren crawling around—several the wrong color. The anti-\nLight wisps soon vanished. Shallan waited a little longer, but she was\ngetting light-headed. So at last she drew in a deep breath, filling herself\nwith Stormlight. The power went to work immediately, and she didn’t\nexplode, which was nice.\n“We shouldn’t have sent you in alone,” Darcira said.\n“Alone? Darcira, we both know my ego is big enough to count for\nbetween two and four people, depending on the day and my mood.” Shallan\ntook a long, ragged breath, and when she breathed out, less Stormlight left\nher than it normally did. An elevated oath meant everything she did was\nmore efficient: she healed better, Stormlight stayed longer, and she was less\n… porous to its escape.\nDarcira pulled her bloodied handkerchief away from the wound. “At\nleast that’s good conventional armor you have on, for leathers. Seems to\nhave absorbed much of the force. At such close range, I’d have expected the\nbolt to go straight out the other side, but it barely punctured the armor on\nyour back.”\n“Perhaps it got lost,” Shallan said. “Take it from one who lives in here—\nmy insides can be confusing.”\n“No, really,” Darcira said. “I don’t think this is hogshide. It’s something\nelse. Probably from … you know …”\nRight. She was wearing the carcass of a beast from some other planet, its\nskin smoother and thicker than that of a hog. Storms. What a surreal\nrealization. Shallan found her feet and wiped her hands on a cloth Jayn\nprovided, as she and the other Lightweavers joined them from the trophy\nroom.\n“What took so long?” Shallan asked them. “Feels like forever since I\ngave the signal.”\n“Erinor spoke to the stones,” Darcira said. “Got the impression there was"

They came charging through without checking first!” She\ngrimaced. “Sorry to let you get hit …”\n“I took it intentionally,” Shallan said, feeling sturdy, even excited, now\nthat she had Stormlight in her veins. Jayn held up her satchel, the shoulder\nstrap tied haphazardly, the leather dimpled with Pattern, who apparently had\nfollowed her instructions and found the others. Shallan slung the satchel\nover her shoulder.\n“Mmm …” Pattern said, moving onto her clothing. “I am very glad you\ndid not get killed while I was not here. I should like to be there when you\ndie. It is a thing friends do for friends.”\nShallan walked to the spot where Mraize and the others had vanished.\nCould she follow? Her powers had a strange relationship with Shadesmar.\nShe’d always had trouble with this, from the first time she’d experimented\nin Kharbranth.\nOr … no … that hadn’t been the first time …\nAs the other Radiants continued exploring—Shallan was particularly\nhappy to have captured those trophies for study—she drew on the\nStormlight to peek into another world, full of churning spheres and a cold\nsun. She held herself back and just looked, seeking …\nThree people on a small boat pulled by mandras, heading for a nearby\nplatform with massive spren overhead. Mraize, Iyatil, and Lieke. One tall\nfigure, two short. They had planned this special means of escape, and were\nheading to Urithiru. Their cell here had suffered a terrible blow—but they’d\nalready set something in motion with Dalinar. A plot to find Ba-Ado-\nMishram, the Unmade.\nShe almost tried pulling herself all the way into Shadesmar, something\nshe wasn’t supposed to be able to do with her powers—but which she’d\ndone before regardless. Two bonds. Two spren. Storms, that explained some\ncurious events in her past; instead of her pulling them into her realm, they\npulled her somewhat into theirs.\nShe blinked, dismissing the vision. She shouldn’t face the Ghostbloods\nalone, but she had an idea about who to go to for help.\n“So,” Lift said, gnawing the last remnants of meat from a bone, “that’s how\nyou build an exploding chamber pot.”\nGavinor—the five-year-old son of King Elhokar, current heir to Alethkar\n—nodded solemnly. He was small for his age; people often thought he was\nmuch younger. Lift didn’t, as she’d known kids like him in orphanages.\nKids who had seen too much.\nThe two of them sat on a table outside the room where Dalinar, Navani,\nand Wit were explaining something to Sebarial and Aladar.

Granted, Baramaz didn’t fall\nover as much when she used her powers. But Lift hardly fell over when she\nused her powers these days.\nIn a stroke of good luck, Sigzil walked by. She followed him with her\neyes, absently lowering the bone from her lips.\n“You often stare at that one, mistress,” Wyndle said, forming next to her\nas a pile of vines. He liked the changes in the tower, because they let him\nappear to anyone. These days he commonly made a funny-looking face to\ninteract, one like his face on the other side. Full and round, with mustachios\nand gemstone eyes that looked like spectacles. He didn’t think it was funny-\nlooking, of course. Pigs didn’t know they stank either.\n“I don’t stare at him,” Lift said, watching the Azish Windrunner give\norders to subordinates. So confident, yet so studious. Not a brute, like so\nmany of the Alethi. He had thoughts. He was smart. Not so tall as to be\nintimidating, but tall enough to be striking.\n“Pardon,” Wyndle said, “but you’re staring right now.”\n“Do you think,” Lift said, “he likes poetry?”\n“Who doesn’t?” Wyndle said. “Ooh, I’ve written seventeen poems about\nthe delightful nature of Iriali footstools!”\n“Shut up,” Lift said. “Gav. Do you think he likes poetry?”\n“I … don’t know what that is,” Gav said.\n“Yeah,” Lift said, still watching Sigzil. Then she added, “I don’t either.”\n“What?” Wyndle said.\n“It’s just a term I’ve heard girls say. Somethin’ about words’n’shit,\nright?”\nWyndle sighed. “Mistress, please don’t use such crude terminology.”\n“That sword ardent does it.”\n“Zahel is not a role model.” Wyndle drew himself up tall. “You are a\nKnight Radiant. A beacon of hope for all people. You should not be using\nvulgarities—besides, you’re not even using that word correctly. It doesn’t\nmake sense in such a linguistic context.”\n“That’s how he uses it,” she muttered. He talked strange sometimes.\nWeird and interesting.\nNobody had seen him since the attack on the tower though. Probably off\nsleeping somewhere. He was smart, that one.

He’s real old—\nlike, old as mountains and shi … um … stuff. But somehow, he don’t know\nthat there’s things a person should do that everyone says ain’t right. You\nknow?”\nGav looked at her, baffled.\n“Just trust me,” Lift said. “Oh! Hey, I remembered. Tower, you there?”\nThe tower spren appeared beside her as a column of light stretching\nbetween discs on the floor and ceiling. The spren liked Lift on account of\nher being awesome. Really strange that more people didn’t feel the same.\n“What?” the Sibling said.\n“You found my chicken yet?” Lift asked.\n“There is no chicken meeting your description in my halls.”\n“It’s here!” Lift said. “Look again. It’s red, and has a beak and feathers.\nAnd it says stuff. Like a person.”\n“You’ve described it many times, Lift.”\n“It was hurt an’ scared. They took it when I was inna cage. You gotta\nfind it, so I can help it.”\nThe Sibling didn’t respond. Those awful people must have taken the\nchicken somewhere—that guy with the scar and too many smiles. Lift"

Next to her, Wyndle grew a vine and patted her on the back,\nwhich was nice.\nBetter, soon Drehy flew in to give a report. And Damnation, did he need\na uniform that tight? Lift leaned to the side, so she could see better when he\nbent over the table with the maps. Damnation.\n“That one?” Wyndle said. “He’s completely the opposite of Sigzil. Why\ndo you stare at that one?”\n“If you need to ask,” Lift said, “then you have no sense of taste\nwhatsoever.”\n“He’s married, you know.”\n“Yeah,” she said, leaning farther to the side. “His husband’s hot too.\nSeems unfair. You’re hot, you can fly, and you have a hot husband?\nWindrunners, Wyndle, I’m tellin’ ya. Something’s up with them. You know,\nI ain’t never seen one o’ them run into a wall? Not even a small wall.”\n“Wyndle,” Gav said softly, “do spren have families?”\n“Why, yes they do, Your Highness!” Wyndle said. “Though we require\nonly one parent, so many spren do not pair bond. But it’s also not\nuncommon for us to do so! Why, even formal marriage isn’t unheard of. I\nhave a mother, who is a dear and kind soul who spends her time gardening\nshoes.”\nGav nodded, knees drawn up against his chest, staring at the ground.\n“My mother gave me to Voidbringers,” he said softly, “to be tormented and\nkilled.”\nLift winced.\n“I think she’s dead now,” Gav continued, his voice even softer. “They\nwon’t tell me straight. I’m too young. But my father is dead. He was killed\ntrying to rescue me …”\n“It is …” Wyndle said. “I mean … I’m sorry.”\n“He was very brave,” Gav whispered. “I don’t remember what he looked\nlike, but he was very brave. He wanted me. He came to save me. Then he\n… then he was slain by the traitor, Vyre.”\n“Hey,” Lift said, nudging him. “Hey.”\nGav looked at her.\nShe reached her hand toward him, two fingers out. He slowly did the\nsame, locking his two fingers into hers. Their secret handshake. The secret\nwas that secret handshakes were stupid, but sometimes you used them\nanyway. Mostly for making scared friends feel like they belonged.\n“You’ve got a place now,” she said. “Remember.”\nHe nodded. He’d need more reminders. Just like she did sometimes.\n“Oh, yes!” Wyndle said. “You have grandparents who love you!”\n“Grampa was going to play swords with me today,” Gav said, wiping his\nnose.\n“Yes, well,” Wyndle said, “the world is kind of in the middle of ending.\nTakes precedence, I should imagine.”\n“I’m gonna learn,” Gav said, a small angerspren pooling beneath him,"

        "text": "Takes precedence, I should imagine.”\n“I’m gonna learn,” Gav said, a small angerspren pooling beneath him,\nlike bubbling blood. “How to use a Shardblade. How to fight. Then I’m\ngonna find everyone who hurt my father, and I’m going to kill them. I’m\ngonna make their eyes burn out and then, when they’re dead, I’ll chop them\nto pieces.”\nHe looked to Lift, then glanced back down, ashamed.\n“Yeah, all right,” she said. “I’ll hold them for you. Deal?”\nHe looked at her again, and finally—for the first time today—smiled.\nYeah, revenge wasn’t gonna be as fun as he thought, and he probably\nneeded to let go of it. But he was five. Right now he needed a friend, not\nsomeone else telling him to be mature.\nBesides. Maturity stank. She resisted the urge to scratch at her wrap,\nwhich she wore bound around her chest. Then Sigzil walked past again, and\nshe absently pulled another rib from her pocket and started chewing on it as\nshe watched.\n“How can you not want to grow up,” Wyndle said, “and still spend half\nyour days ogling men? Don’t you see the contradiction?”\n“No,” she said. “Don’t be stupid.”\n“But your interest in men is obviously a manifestation of your\nadvancement toward adulthood. You don’t seem to mind that, but you hate\nthe secondary sex characteristics manifesting—”\n“Hey Tower,” Lift said.\nAgain the little dancing column of light appeared—though she knew it\nwould be invisible to other humans. Lift saw into the other realm a little.\nSomething related to what had happened to her when she’d gone to the\nNightwatcher, that lying liar who didn’t keep her promises.\n“Yes?” the Sibling said.\n“Are all cultivationspren like this?” Lift asked. “Or did I get stuck with\nthe druff?”\n“What is a druff?”\n“Him.”\n“There is great variety in the personalities of all spren, Lift,” the Sibling\nsaid. “So I’d have to say you got stuck with a druff. Whatever that is.”\nShe grunted, eyeing Wyndle.\n“I like being a druff,” he said, chin out—though he didn’t really have a\nbody, just vines and a head. “You’re lucky. You think just any spren would\nput up with your abuse?”\n“It ain’t abuse,” Lift muttered. “It’s teasing.”\n“You should feel grateful,” the tower said. “Wyndle is correct. Relatively\nfew humans are chosen for the privilege of a Radiant bond.”\n“Ah, what do you know?” she said. “You’re a building.”\n“And?” the tower said.\n“And people fart in you. Like all the time. I bet half the people in this\nroom are doing it right now.”\n“You realize,” the tower said, “you are host to millions of life-forms.\nThey exist in your gut, on your skin, all over you.”\n“What?” Lift said.\n“Oh!” Wyndle said. “I’ve heard of this. Germs, yes! Wisdom of the\nHeralds. People with very detailed and specific life sense can feel them, I’m\ntold! Millions upon millions of tiny creatures living on the skin of humans.”"

Millions upon millions of tiny creatures living on the skin of humans.”\n“They particularly like the hair follicles,” the tower said. “I can feel them\non you, Lift.”\nLift stared at her hands, aghast.\n“And yes,” the Sibling added, “they live their entire lives there. Eating\nyour dead skin flakes. Defecating on you. You are a tower like me, Lift.\nEvery human is.”\n“That is the grossest thing I’ve ever heard.” She looked to Gav. “Hey\nGav. Did you know we have millions of tiny creatures living on us?”\n“Gross!”\n“I know! Awesome.”\n“You were just saying,” the tower told her, “that I’m not worth listening\nto because I’m filled with things that fart!”\n“And?” Lift said.\n“And you are too! So nobody should listen to you either!”\n“Gav,” Lift said. “Should anyone listen to us when we say things? About\nimportant stuff, I mean.”\n“Of course not,” Gav said. “We’re kids.”\nLift looked to the glowing column of light and shrugged.\n“I honestly have no idea why I started talking to you,” the tower said.\n“It’s because you sensed Cultivation’s touch on her,” Wyndle said,\ncompletely missing the context of the tower’s complaint. As usual. What a\ndruff.\nBut … well …\nHe did put up with her. Storms only knew she wouldn’t want to have to\ndo that.\n“Hey,” she said to Wyndle. “Thanks.”\n“What for?” he asked, frowning at her.\nShe put out her hand, two fingers out and crooked, like a claw. He\nregarded it, then opened his eyes wide in shock. Trembling, he formed a\nhand from vines and met hers.\n“I get the secret handshake?” he whispered.\n“Just don’t go sharin’ it,” she said.\n“It must remain special,” Gav added.\n“I … I’m honored,” Wyndle said.\nFinally, at long last, the door into the other room opened. Wit, Dalinar,\nand Navani strode out—and headed straight for the lifts, determined\nexpressions on their faces. Behind them, Aladar and Sebarial looked\nseriously disturbed.\nDamnation. They’d decided something important.\n“Grampa?” Gav said, standing up on the table. “We can play swords?”\nDalinar stopped amid generals and scholars. “There is something more I\nneed to do, son. I’m sorry.”\nGav wilted like a plant with no water. He slumped back down on the\ntable, drawing a long grey streamer of a gloomspren—and bearing the kind\nof expression no secret handshake could fix.\n“You can come in the lift with us, Gav,” Navani said. “Spend a little time\ntogether. Come along.”\nEager, the boy hopped down and rushed over. The nursemaid joined\nthem—she’d been helping herself to snacks, falsely assuming she could\ntrust Gav with a Radiant. Lift fished the last pork rib from her pocket,\neyeing the group as they left.\n“Gram,” Gav said on the way, “what’s ‘shit’ mean?”"

Maybe … maybe teaching the crown prince to cuss hadn’t\nbeen her smartest move. Secretly deep down, she was a bit of a druff,\nwasn’t she?\n“I’m impressed, mistress,” Wyndle said. “You didn’t demand to go with\nthem!”\n“I’m feelin’ kinda grown-up today,” Lift said. “On account of my good\nmanners and full stomach.”\nWyndle nodded, satisfied.

It was a silly\nemotion, but he seemed to feel a lot of those. More than other people.\nThe tower was far better now. Yet out in the fields—which were on large\nstone wafers that sprouted from the mountainside around the base of the\ntower—he found himself displeased. The air was humid, soft, and muggy\nwhen it had once been chill and sharp. Renarin passed row upon row of\nlavis polyps. Even after a few days, the transformation was visible; this row\nwas an inch larger than it had been yesterday.\nHe squatted down. At this rate, the farmers said they’d be able to bring in\ncrops every two months. Suddenly it was clear how the vast tower fed its\npotentially hundreds of thousands of occupants. The air was so wet he felt\nhe was swimming, his uniform jacket uncomfortable. Yet a dozen yards\naway, closer to the tower, the air was a steady comfortable temperature.\nIt all felt … too easy.\nSilly thoughts, he told himself again, standing up straight. For a silly\nman. He looked across the field to Rlain, who was chatting with several\nhuman farmers. Rlain had spent months toiling to teach the humans how to\nuse Stormlight and song to grow plants. Suddenly that work was\nunnecessary.\nThree days after defending the tower—and the humans in it, against his\nown kind—Rlain was back here, checking on the fields. He’d told Renarin\nthat since the Sibling’s awakening, the rhythms became harder to hear the\nlonger he spent inside the tower, so he preferred it out here. Although\npeople side-eyed him, although he’d been called a shellhead, he was here\nmaking certain the very people who distrusted him wouldn’t starve.\nHe stood tall—almost as tall as Kaladin, and several inches taller than\nRenarin—with black skin marbled with red. He had a thick neck and strong\njaw, outlined by a short red-and-black beard. He pointed, encouraging the\nfarmers to grow a line of sugarbark between the lavis and the tubers, which\nneeded standing water to sprout down into. A natural bit of shoring up,"

A natural bit of shoring up,\nshould the ponds overflow—plus something to do with the way the\ncremlings pollinated different crops. These were listener strains, cultivated\non the Shattered Plains, and Rlain knew their intricacies.\nRlain suddenly turned and waved toward the sky. Renarin followed the\ngesture to see a Windrunner approaching. Lanky Drehy landed nearby, and\ngave Rlain a wave back, though he trotted over to Renarin. “Hey,” he said.\n“Meeting is on break. Your aunt asked me to bring you a report.”\n“Thank you,” Renarin said softly.\nOf course she’d send a report. She still hoped, as Dalinar did, that\nRenarin would change his mind and agree to be king of Urithiru should his\nfather fall. Barring that, they wanted him to be Jasnah’s heir until Gav was\nof age. Though Jasnah would ensure an elected official took her place, they\nthought Alethkar should have a monarch, even if they didn’t have absolute\npower.\nDrehy delivered a quick, affable report on the meetings. Renarin found\nhis mind drifting, and he kept glancing at Rlain.\nYou will need this information, Glys said in his mind. You will pay\nattention?\nI will, Renarin sent. Though not all spren and Radiants could\ncommunicate directly by thoughts, he and Glys were increasingly\nintertwined. Renarin didn’t mind that Glys felt what he did. It was a\nchallenge sometimes, figuring out what people meant or wanted from him\n—and having another perspective, no matter how alien, was helpful.\nAfter the report, Drehy lingered, and Renarin started to sweat more in his\njacket. This was the part of conversations he always had trouble with. He’d\nalready said thank you. Should he try small talk? How should this end?\nEveryone else seemed to know what to do—they flowed in and out of\nconversations like eels in a shared current.\nRenarin was the rock in that current.\n“So,” Drehy said, settling back against one of the stone workstations that\nwere scattered through the fields, “want to talk about it?”\nIt? Renarin’s panic grew. What “it”? Was he supposed to know what this\nparticular “it” was?\nI do not know, Glys said, equally worried. Is it us, maybe? They will\nalways be afraid of us, I fear.\n“The way you look at Rlain,” Drehy said in response to Renarin’s\napparent confusion.\n“Oh, that,” Renarin said, relaxing. It was an embarrassing topic, but at\nleast now he knew what the topic was. “Is it … um … obvious?”\n“You learn to watch for guys who watch other guys,” Drehy said,\nshrugging. “I don’t want to pry. It’s nobody’s business. Just wanted you to\nknow I’m here, should you want to talk.”\n“It’s silly,” Renarin said, glancing down, blushing. “He’s not even\nhuman.”\n“I say it’s better to think of everyone as people. Human. Listener. Spren.\nAll people. Even if some of them glow and are annoying.”"

Even if some of them glow and are annoying.”\n“Point,” Drehy’s spren—Talla—said, appearing between them. She\nalways took the fluttering shape of a blue chicken. “I’m not annoying. I’m\nhabitually right. You simply have serious trouble equating one with the\nother, Drehy.”\n“Point,” Drehy said, “being right can be annoying. Habitual or not. The\ntwo are not mutually exclusive.”\nRenarin let himself smile, hesitant. Drehy, like the other members of\nBridge Four, treated him as one of them, awkward or not. To them, he was\n… well, he was a person.\n“I … don’t know what to do,” Renarin said. “About Rlain. About any of\nthis. Aunt Navani won’t be happy. She wants grandchildren. And … um …\nlikes people to be normal.”\n“You are normal,” Drehy said. “Or rather, nobody is normal. Normal\ndoesn’t exist. So if we slavishly try to dress ourselves to imitate it, all we’re\nreally doing is becoming a different kind of abnormal—a miserable kind.”\nRenarin looked down.\n“What do you want, Renarin?” Drehy asked. “Not what your aunt, or\nyour father, or anyone else wants. What do you want?”\n“Maybe what I want,” he said, “is for my aunt, and my father, and\neveryone else to be happy.”\nDrehy shrugged.\nStorms. How to interpret that?\n“Could you … um …” Renarin said, “just say what you mean, please?\nI’m confused.”\n“Sorry,” Drehy said. “I forget sometimes. Renarin, I’m not going to tell\nyou what to be. I’m not going to tell you when, or if, you have to tell\nanyone. You live your life how you want. I’ve known some who would\nprefer to pretend they aren’t different. Doesn’t seem to work often, but it’s\ntheir right. All I’m saying is if you have questions, I might have answers.\nNot ultimate answers. Maybe not even correct answers. Just the answers of\none man who’s been in your shoes.”\nRenarin felt an odd peace at hearing that—odd because his anxiety did\nnot go away. It never really did, but it was nice to have a sense of peace\nalongside it. Once in a while.\nSo … dared he ask?\n“Um …” Renarin said. “What if … you know … he …?”\n“Prefers women?”\nRenarin nodded.\n“Then move on,” Drehy said. “Look, I’ll be honest. It happens.\nNobody’s sense for these things is perfect, and if you ask, sometimes it\nembarrasses people. But trust me, in the long run it’s better to ask, and deal\nwith it if you’re wrong.”\n“I don’t think I could do that,” Renarin said, blushing.\nDrehy took a long, deep breath, but didn’t contradict him. He seemed to\nmean what he’d said earlier—he wasn’t intending to lecture.\n“It’s silly,” Renarin said. “Listeners don’t even court like we do.”\n“They often bond, two people for life.

If you’re willing to try.”\n“I can’t,” Renarin said, his head still down. “I really, really can’t.”\nDrehy moved as if to pat Renarin on the shoulder in a way that would\nhave comforted someone else. He paused though, then gave Renarin an\nencouraging gesture. Bless him, he listened. He knew that Renarin didn’t\nlike to be touched. Though Renarin would have been fine with it in this case\n—he liked some physical contact on his own terms, but he didn’t like being\nsurprised—the more important thing was that Drehy had listened. He\nactually cared. Renarin found himself smiling.\n“You can do this,” Drehy said. “If you don’t want to, that’s all right. But\nRenarin, I know you walked onto a battlefield at Thaylen Field determined\nto make a stand against overwhelming odds all by yourself. I know you\nstruggled with visions of the future and sorted through them, bringing\nmessages to your father. I know you can carry a great weight, my friend.\nYou’ve done it already.” He smiled, then drew in Stormlight and lifted into\nthe air. “Like I said, just one man’s experiences. Bridge Four stew tonight.\nYou coming?”\n“Who’s cooking?”\n“Does it matter?”\n“Determines whether I eat first,” Renarin said, smiling.\n“It’s me.”\n“Then I’ll come hungry,” Renarin said. “Thank you, Drehy.”\n“When you have questions, ask,” he said, and soared back up to rejoin\nthe meeting.\nRenarin turned toward Rlain. But then the sky darkened and the air went\nblack as the world became stained glass. Glys pulsed within him.\nThey had entered a vision of what might come. And this one did not look\npleasant.\nRlain had found his perfect form. Or rather, every form could be perfect for\nhim now.\nIn the past, workform had been his favorite for its versatility. It also left\nhis mind the clearest—the most him. But it didn’t have the height he’d\ncome to appreciate in warform—nor the strength of arm or the armored\ncarapace. He liked the way he looked in warform, and it felt the most like\nhim on the outside. Unfortunately, it made him a little too … eager to fight\nand obey. He could counteract both of these emotions, as a form did not\ncontrol you. But it did subtly change the way you thought.\nIt turned out that being Radiant let him counteract that even more fully.\nHe held up his finger as an awespren—a floating blue ball—alighted on it.\nThis one was invisible to the human farmers who were discussing his\nadvice. Bonded to Tumi, he felt like himself inside regardless of form."

Tumi rarely spoke,\nbut it didn’t take words to understand his spren. The rhythms could do it.\nTumi’s rhythm changed to Anxiety. Rlain turned toward Renarin—he\nhadn’t seen the young man approaching until Drehy had arrived, but it had\nseemed the two had something to talk about, perhaps politics from above.\nRlain had left them alone.\nNow Renarin was encased in a shimmering distortion in the air. Was\nsomething wrong?\nCuriosity from Tumi. Rlain attuned the same, hesitant, and knew Tumi\nthought the humans wouldn’t see what was happening to Renarin. It took a\nstronger Connection to the realms.\n“A vision,” Rlain said. “That’s one of his visions?”\nThe awespren swelled, drawing the attention of the farmers, who saw it\nas a ring of expanding smoke. Rlain let the awespren hop away, then\nexcused himself and walked across rows of plants to Renarin, who appeared\nto be staring at nothing. Dared he intervene?\nTumi counseled boldness, so Rlain stepped forward. In a snap—like the\nsudden strike of a drum—he was inside the vision. The sky was black, and\ndarkness surrounded them like one might dim the other lights in a room to\ninspect a single glowing gemstone. From the ground rose exquisite\nwindows made as if from colorful glass.\n“They’re beautiful,” Rlain noted. “Seems like a very human\nmanifestation though. I wonder why Tumi and Glys show us them in this\nform. Is it their doing, or ours, or some combination?”\nRenarin turned to him looking shocked, then excited. “Rlain!” he said.\n“You can see them?”\nRlain nodded. “I’d hoped I’d be able to see your visions, with my own\nspren. Is this …” He trailed off.\nRenarin was crying.\n“Renarin?” he said to Despair. “What’s wrong? Did I intrude? Should I\nleave?”\nHe turned to go, but Renarin grabbed his hand. Which was surprising,\nfrom Renarin.\n“I have spent,” Renarin whispered, “what feels like an eternity alone\nwith these visions. From the days where I crept on the floor and scrawled\nnumbers, to the day when I realized my family’s love could overcome a\ndark future. To a few days ago, when I heard you’d bonded a spren. Now …\nI’m not alone.”\nRenarin pulled him along the line of stained glass windows, which stood\nupright with nothing to support them. Rlain followed, genuinely intrigued,\nbut also because Renarin had always tried so hard to make Rlain feel\nincluded. Rlain respected the other members of Bridge Four, Kaladin in\nparticular, but there was something special about Renarin. When Rlain had\nbeen alone, rejected by the spren, Renarin had been the one to comfort him.\nThat moment had convinced Rlain that even if it was hard, there could\nbe a place for him among the humans.

Remember it can be lies.”\n“Why pay attention if it could all be lies?”\n“Because truth is just the lie that happened,” Renarin said.\nRlain attuned Skepticism. “That … doesn’t make sense.”\nRenarin stepped up to one of the windows, and Glys—his spren—\nseparated from him, floating up in the air by his head in the shape of a\nshimmering red lattice, with beads of light “dripping” from the top and\nvanishing into the sky. The window depicted Renarin sitting on a throne. He\nwore some kind of archaic outfit, a little like the fencing attire people wore\non the Alethi training grounds, with the skirts.\n“This is Kholinar,” Renarin said, “but it’s not the throne room. That\nlooks like my room. See, those are my models on that shelf.”\n“Models?”\n“Wooden carvings of creatures,” Renarin explained. “You paint them to\nbe lifelike.” He blushed. “I mostly bought knights instead of animals. I\nneeded something to do with my time when Adolin was training. And here,\nthose are my books. I’d spend a few hours each day having them read to\nme.”\n“Such knowledge,” Rlain said. “So much at your fingertips. No wonder\nyou know so much.”\nRenarin blushed again.\n“What?” Rlain asked to Reconciliation. Had he said something wrong?\n“Those aren’t books full of facts or learning,” Renarin admitted.\n“They’re adventure stories, the kind written for young women. I had a\nwhole collection, much to Father’s embarrassment.”\n“Renarin,” Rlain said, “I have seen how your father treats you. He’s not\nembarrassed of you.”\n“He was when I was young,” Renarin said. “But he was wrong back\nthen, wasn’t he?”\nThey studied the image a little longer before Rlain picked out the detail\nthat was bothering him. “Renarin, I think that is singer clothing you’re\nwearing.” He pointed at the folds of cloth, noting how they draped the body.\nThe coloring … the patterns …\n“Are you sure?” Renarin asked.\n“No,” Rlain said, “but I did see a lot of their clothing in the tower these\nlast few weeks. It looks the same.”\n“Lies,” Renarin said softly. “Each picture here shows only one of several\nlikely outcomes. I asked Wit, and he says it’s the way of things—no one\nactually knows the future, not even the gods.”\n“But one possibility will become true,” Rlain said. “That’s what you\nmeant earlier.”\nRenarin nodded, always so solemn. Thoughtful. “We should study the\nother windows before they vanish.”\n“Do we know why they appear?” Rlain said. “What determines when we"

Thoughtful. “We should study the\nother windows before they vanish.”\n“Do we know why they appear?” Rlain said. “What determines when we\nsee one of these, and which … possibility is depicted?”\n“I haven’t been able to figure that out,” Renarin said. “Not fully. Though\nGlys says …”\n“Swells,” Glys said. “There are swells in the rhythms of Roshar.\nCurrents, and old gods, will watch.”\n“Old gods,” Rlain said as Tumi, in his gemheart, changed to the Rhythm\nof the Lost. “The Unmade?”\n“Older,” Glys said. “Older still than Honor, Cultivation, and Odium.”\n“What’s older than them?” Rlain asked, glancing at Renarin. “Even the\nOld Magic, as you call it, is a spren of Cultivation.”\n“When Honor and Cultivation came to Roshar,” Glys said, “deep within\nthe days beyond memory, times as dark to history as the depths of the ocean\nare to light, you—Rlain—were already here. Your people.”\nRlain attuned the Rhythm of the Winds, for something as old as those\ndistant years. Humans had come to Roshar long ago—and brought Odium\nwith them. He had been their god, who had accepted the loyalty of the\nancient singers after Honor betrayed them. Rlain hadn’t put together the\ndeeper truth: that even Honor and Cultivation had come to Roshar and\nfound the singers.\n“Long ago, before any of them arrived,” Rlain said, “did we have forms?\nWere there spren?”\n“I do not know,” Glys said. “I see ahead, not back. You will seek\nanswers from those more ancient than I. The Bondsmith sees backward.\nAlways, his eyes are toward what happened.”\n“Jasnah too,” Renarin said softly. “She knows the past better than any.”\nHe turned along the hallway of windows. “But we look forward …”\nRlain joined him, each of their steps crinkling as if on black glass at their\nfeet, as they continued along the stained glass windows that rose on both\nsides, making a tunnel of light. The windows were the same on both the\nright and the left: Renarin on a throne, followed by a dark and building\nstorm. Rlain knew that one. The Everstorm, which passed by every nine\ndays. It was easy to forget about in Urithiru, which was usually above both\nstorms, but others brought reports. Lightning strikes. Thunder. Generally\nless destruction than the highstorm, but a feeling of malevolence and\nsomething watching, biding its time. Preparing.\nWhy would there be a window depicting the storm? It had already\narrived. Rlain hummed to Confusion. And Renarin, strangely, did as well?\nOr he tried. He glanced at Rlain and tried to imitate his humming. Renarin’s\nattempt was off-rhythm and too loud, like a child sounding out a word that\nwas too big for them. But … Rlain had never heard a human even try\nbefore.\n“Any idea why this is here?” Rlain asked him.\n“No,” Renarin replied. “Sometimes the windows are just like this—"

In the distance, a city was collapsing\ninto a spreading pit. Though the image was static, he felt motion to it\nsomehow. As if that city were constantly crumbling into that pit.\n“I recognize this,” Renarin said. “From my aunt’s notes—when she\nwrote out my father’s visions. This was … the first vision? Or the last one?\nHe stood on a cliff and watched our homeland crumble.”\n“Which … has also already happened,” Rlain said to Consideration.\n“Are we sure these show the future?”\n“They will,” Glys promised. “They will.”\nMaybe, Tumi added by a thrumming from within him. Only maybe.\nThe fourth window was, strangely, a bright green field with distant\nfigures standing in it. The grass didn’t flee from them, so perhaps they’d\nbeen standing there a long time. He counted … twelve? He looked to\nRenarin, who reached up and rested a hand beside the window.\n“Peace,” Renarin said. “I feel peace from this one … Who are they, do\nyou suppose?” He tried humming to Confusion, poorly, but Rlain could\nkind of tell what he meant.\n“Humans,” Rlain said. “They’re all human, I think. This one might be a\nHorneater, and this one Makabaki … And this one—what are those humans\nwith the blue skin?”\n“Those are the Natans,” Renarin said. “Unless you’re talking about the\nAimians, who aren’t humans, but neither are quite as blue as the woman in\nthis picture.” He hesitated, squinting at the distant woman in a vivid blue\nskirt, with white hair and blue skin. “Does this mean anything to you?”\n“No. I’m sorry.”\nRenarin sighed. “They seem to be getting more vague.” He closed his\neyes. “Is that last one still there, at the end?”\nRlain gazed past Renarin toward the “end” of their hallway—and was\nsurprised to see a window there, shadowed in the darkness. No light shone\nthrough it, so he’d missed it.\n“What is that?” Rlain said, walking closer. It depicted only a face. A\nsimple face with intricate patterns, black and red swirling. A singer,\nfemalen, against a black background, etched in glass. Staring at him.\nThen it moved.\nRlain jumped. In fits and jumps the image split, multiple versions of the\nface moving, raging, the eyes going wide, the Rhythm of Agony shaking the\nframe. Windows around them cracked, but the one in the center kept\nvibrating. Her face shuddering back and forth, then her hands against the\nedges of the window, curling, bulging out—as if trying to break free.\nRenarin screamed as the windows to the left and right shattered,\nexposing a dark wasteland. New windows grew up like vines, crystallizing\nand exploding, leaving jagged stumps—but before they broke, Rlain could\npick out images. Burning cities. Broken bodies."

Broken bodies.\nAbove it all a rising Rhythm of Agony, with the femalen singer’s words\nechoing to the sound. I will break it. I will break IT ALL.\nRenarin seized him and somehow pulled him out of the darkness. Just\none step, and it was gone. They were once more on the fields in the hot air,\nsurrounded by confused farmers.\nRlain fell to his hands and knees, carapace kneecaps grinding stone,\nsweat pooling under his collar at the edges of his skull carapace and\nstreaming down his face. Renarin collapsed beside him, trembling.\n“Is that … how it normally goes?” Rlain asked.\n“That was something new. Did you recognize the face?”\n“No, but the rhythm was Agony,” Rlain said. He took a deep breath. “It’s\none of the new rhythms. That people can only access when they are Regal\nor Fused.”\nRenarin closed his eyes. “Welcome to the fun, I suppose.”\n“You said this was something new!” Rlain said to Betrayal. “Implying\nit’s not like this all the time!”\n“Yes, but it’s always something new. So you get used to not being used\nto anything. Ever again.”\n“Delightful,” Rlain said, flopping onto his back, deliberately attuning\nPeace and counting the movements of the rhythm to calm himself.\n“Sorry,” Renarin eventually said, sitting up. “For dragging you into this.”\n“I wanted a spren,” Rlain said. “I asked for it.”\n“You wanted to fly,” Renarin said. “Like the others.”\n“I’m a listener, Renarin,” Rlain said. “I don’t ever do things the way\neveryone else does.” He took another long, deep breath. “This seems more\nuseful than flying. Assuming we can make any sense of it.”\nRenarin nodded, and then smiled. Humans were often overly expressive\nwith their faces, so it might be nothing. But Rlain asked anyway. “Is\nsomething funny?”\n“Still just happy,” Renarin said, “not to be the only one.”\nRlain hummed to Appreciation before remembering that wouldn’t mean\nanything to a human. He kept forgetting, even after two years among them.\nBefore he could explain himself, however, a shadow fell on him. He tipped\nhis head back to see Shallan, hands on her hips, wearing some kind of\narmorlike leather outfit, a white coat, and a matching hat.\n“Resting?” she said. “Eight days until the fate of the world is decided,\nand you two are napping in a field?”\nRlain hummed to Irritation. Sometimes it was good humans didn’t\nunderstand, because in singer company, that would have been rude.\n“Come on,” she said. “I legitimately need your help.”\n“What is the problem?” Renarin said, standing.\n“It involves your father,” Shallan said, “the Spiritual Realm, and a group\nof people who are trying to find the prison of an ancient, evil spren. Ba-\nAdo-Mishram. You know that one?”\nMishram."

She had ruled the singers long ago—a\nspren who had wanted to perpetuate the fighting after the Fused left. The\none who had been determined to exterminate humankind, escalating the\nwar.\nShe was the reason Rlain’s people had abandoned their forms and left.\nShe was the queen of the gods they had forsaken.\nAnd he suspected he’d just seen her face in the vision.\nSo think, my dear reader. As a soldier retreats from a battle he\ncannot win. As a woman rejects a home that shows her only\nviolence. As a family finds hope in walking away from dying fields\nduring a season of too much rain.\n—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable\nShallan had brought some of the Windrunners from the raiding party, so\nshe, Renarin, and Rlain quickly reached the Oathgates. From there, Shallan\nsent one Windrunner to find Dalinar and Navani to explain, as she worried\nher spanreed message hadn’t been received.\nShe then brought the group into Shadesmar via Oathgate. Mraize and\nIyatil were on the move; she needed to be too. On the other side—with\nTestament and Pattern appearing in full-sized form next to her—Shallan got\nher first sight of the tower there, after its awakening.\nIt was brilliant.\nBefore, the tower had manifested as a shimmer of light, but now that\nlight had coalesced—like false dawn becoming true sunlight. It formed a\ntower that was a clone of the one in the Physical Realm, but as if created\nfrom glowing glass. A sphere infused, but on the scale of a mountain.\nThough the light did not overpower her, her eyes watered, trying to take\nin the entire structure. It glowed with the fractured variety of a thousand\ncolors—an artist’s bounty of effulgent shades. Changing, each moment a\ndifferent hue, as if the tower were too exuberant, too joyous and alive to be\nconfined to mere color.\nIt was magnetic, taking not only her breath and attention, but her soul\nand mind, which longed to just once create something so beautiful. It was\nthe pinnacle of all artistry. This was the height to which creations could rise.\nThis was what you could … could …\nDo you need me to take control? Radiant asked.\nPlease! Shallan said, tears in her eyes.\nRadiant took a deep breath, acknowledged the pretty tower, and moved\non. Two Windrunners—Isasik and Breteh—waited in here with their spren\nand their squires. Together, the group was chatting with the Shadesmar\nguards. Though she’d left the bulk of her strike force to watch the captives,\nshe’d sent these Windrunners on ahead to try to see if they could find\nMraize and Iyatil while Shallan fetched Renarin.\nThey didn’t seem to have learned anything, judging by their postures as\nthey talked with the three guards that were posted on this side just in case.\nRadiant looked around, hoping for some sign of the Ghostbloods.

Here near\nthe tower, the ten Oathgates manifested as tall pillars—each with its own set\nof lofty inkspren. Ramps ringed each pillar, spiraling down to the beads far\nbelow. With the restoration of the Sibling, glowing walkways had appeared\nconnecting the pillars, as well as leading to the tower itself, which now\nstood upon a large glowing platform of its own.\nSeeing nothing amiss, she trotted to the Windrunners on one of the\nwalkways.\n“Brightness,” Isasik the Windrunner said. This wasn’t the cartographer,\nbut the other Isasik: a shorter man with an excitable demeanor. Both he and\nBreteh were former bridgemen from Bridge Thirteen, the group that had\nbecome Teft’s squires. She thought that was why they wore red glyphwards\non their arms—something about a pact relating to Moash and vengeance.\nRadiant appreciated their regard for a fallen companion. Over time,\ntower soldiers had moved away from wearing Kholin blue, and toward a\nuniform representing their new kingdom. It appeared white uniforms with\ngold trim had finally been settled upon, as it was one of the distinctive color\ncombinations that wasn’t associated with an Alethi or Veden princedom.\n“We did a sweep of the area and found no sign of the fugitives,” Breteh\nsaid, hovering a few feet off the ground. “The guards haven’t seen them\neither.”\n“We’ve been posted here all day,” said a guard with a faint Bavland\naccent he was obviously trying to mask. “Nobody transferred in until these\nWindrunners arrived.”\nRadiant folded her arms, thoughtful. Around her feet, a collection of\nbeads gathered and bounced up and down. “Other Shallan!” they said. The\nWindrunners seemed to find that quite amusing.\nHad she been wrong? Would Mraize and Iyatil flee, instead of trying to\ncontinue their plan? “They entered Shadesmar on the Shattered Plains,\nthousands of miles away,” she said. “They’d need to have found their way\nhere via Oathgate.”\nCould Mraize and Iyatil be waiting before arriving? Would they jump\nhere at the moment Dalinar opened his portal? Making a break for it?\nRenarin and Rlain joined her, having overcome their awe. “Radiant,”\nRenarin said, “could you please explain better what’s going on? I’m still\nconfused.”\n“Sorry,” Radiant said. “Shallan is inefficient with words at times. There\nis a secretive group known as the Ghostbloods, who are seeking to control\nthe balance of power on Roshar.”\n“Again?” Rlain asked. “Didn’t you round them up right before the\ninvasion?”\n“Those were the Sons of Honor,” Renarin said. “Amaram’s former\ncohort. You know, I wonder if we ask for this sort of thing. We create this\nair of Alethi propriety, promising that we’re up-front and honest. No one\ncan say what they really think, because it would be ‘un-Alethi.’ Then our\nhonesty becomes a lie as we turn to scheming …”"

Unfortunately for us, the Ghostbloods are supported by some\nvery powerful individuals from offworld.”\n“You mean the Fused?” Rlain asked.\n“Further offworld,” Radiant said. “Shallan was recruited by them when\nshe was new to her powers. She kept pretending to be a member, hoping to\nlearn more. It came to a head recently, and she realized she had to stop them\nfrom reaching their goals.”\n“Well, that’s a storming big secret,” Rlain said to a very pronounced\nrhythm, which Radiant couldn’t place.\nRenarin just met her eyes, then nodded. Damnation. He understood. She\nnow felt infinitely more guilty for finding him weird when they first met.\n“They’ve been keenly interested in the Unmade,” Radiant said. “They’ve\nmet with Sja-anat, and … Renarin, I think she’s given them spren to bond.\nLike she did to you and Rlain.”\nSpeaking of which … where were their spren? Shouldn’t they have\nappeared when Pattern, Testament, and her armor had?\n“She … plays both sides,” Renarin admitted. “She’s told me as much.”\n“Her spren accepted me,” Rlain said, “when none of the honorspren\nwould.”\n“That’s unfair,” Breteh’s honorspren said, glowing blue with hands on\nher hips. “Lots of humans weren’t chosen either, Rlain. It comes down to\nindividual decisions.”\n“And yet,” Rlain said, “every single member of Bridge Four now has an\nhonorspren—except me. Curious, how people’s decisions are an individual\nmatter when they’re confronted about them—but those decisions form\nblatant patterns.”\n“Sja-anat,” Radiant said, drawing their attention back to the topic,\n“cannot be trusted—but she’s also not our enemy. She said her spren have\nan affinity for the Spiritual Realm. I think the Ghostbloods are planning to\nuse those spren to help them navigate it. I determined I’d have a much\nbetter chance of figuring out how they’d do that, or even what the\nGhostbloods plan to do, with your help.”\n“Spiritual Realm,” Renarin said. “Where you said …”\n“A certain thing is hidden,” Radiant continued, not wanting to say too\nmuch in front of the guards. Shallan had given this explanation earlier.\nRenarin nodded.\n“So … your spren,” Radiant said. “Do they have any insights? I’m\ncertain the Ghostbloods are going to show up here, likely right when\nDalinar opens the portal. The fugitives might make a dash for it.”\n“It would help,” Renarin said, “to know where this portal will be.” He\nnarrowed his eyes, then pointed at the tower.\nRadiant had the strangest impression as he did so—that his arm and hand\nwere outlined by a soft red glow while in motion, as if he was overlapping"

This light, possibly his spren, moved just\nbefore he did. It was an afterimage, in reverse.\n“There,” Renarin said. “Can you see them?”\n“I can,” Rlain said, pointing as well—and his body had exactly the same\nprecursor image. “They’re in the tower. Both Bondsmiths. Their souls glow\npowerfully.”\n“Spren revolve around Aunt Navani,” Renarin said, “the way winds\nmove through a chasm, sculpted by it. They’re coming down in a lift.”\n“So we go to them,” Radiant said. “Because that’s where Mraize and his\nteam will need to be, once the portal opens.”\nIt was starting to grow dark outside as Navani finally led the group down a\nlift, through Urithiru, to find an appropriate place to perform their\nexperiment. Storms. The entire second day had passed that quickly? She\ndidn’t feel tired, a blessing from the Sibling, though she did see some signs\nof fatigue in Dalinar. The way he clasped his hands behind him, forcing\nhimself to stand tall.\nThey reached the ground floor, light fading in the sky outside the great\natrium window as the sun set on the opposite side of Urithiru. She led them\nthrough a swarm of gloryspren to a stairwell, holding Gav’s hand all the\nway. The boy needed more attention from both of them—and fortunately,\nhe had managed a nap during the many meetings. As they reached the\nbottom of the steps, entering a long hallway, she trailed her other hand\nalong the wall, layered with strata in lines and patterns.\nShe could feel the tower thrumming. A thousand different mechanisms\nworking in concert, like the organs of a human body. Dalinar and Wit strode\nbehind her. Behind them were the characteristic host of attendants and\nguards. Navani could almost ignore them as she walked.\n“Gram?” Gav asked softly. “I’m scared.”\nShe stopped and knelt, letting several of the others pass by. “Why, Gav?”\nHe looked up toward the gloryspren bobbing around her. Then he\ncringed.\n“Could you back away, please,” Navani said, lifting her head and\nspeaking to the spren.\nThey did, many of them vanishing and the others moving to the very top\nof the corridor. Gav relaxed. The spren that had tormented him in the\nKholinar palace had been of a completely different variety, but that didn’t\nmatter in the face of trauma.\n“Was that it?” she asked.\n“Not just that,” he whispered. “The tower … I saw it earlier … and\nGram, it’s a spren? The whole thing?”\n“The tower is good, Gav,” she said. “It cares for us.”\nHe nodded, but didn’t seem convinced. So she gently took his hand and\nheld it to the wall.\n“Can you feel that?” she asked him.\n“I’m not sure,” he said, scrunching up his face.\n“Close your eyes,” she said, “and listen.”"

They’re carrying laundry from all through the tower down\nhere, where it can be washed. It’s not fully up and running yet—we need\nmany more boxes—but this is one of the ways we know the tower is good.”\n“Because … it has boxes?”\n“Because it makes everyone’s lives better,” Navani said. “With this\nmechanism, no one will need to climb stairs with heavy bags of clothing.\nBeyond this are vast rooms where fresh water is cycled and cleaned, so no\none has to carry water. The tower is doing that for us all, not only for kings\nand queens. It is good, Gav. I promise.”\n“I feel it, Gram!” Gav said, his hand beside hers. “I really feel it. The\ntower is alive …”\n“All things are,” she said. “Whether it’s the cup you drink from, the\nhome you live in, or the air you breathe. All of it is part of this world given\nus by the Almighty, and everything in this world is alive. It is one of the\nways we know God loves us.”\nAnd surely He did. Even if the person who had held the power was dead,\nthat was merely an avatar, a Vessel—not God. It was that Vessel Dalinar\nhoped to replace. If he did, would he then return to conventional belief as\nshe hoped? His new ways, new teachings, weren’t strictly blasphemous, but\nthings about them did make her uncomfortable.\nDalinar and Wit had reached a door at the end of the hallway. They\nstepped in, then a moment later Dalinar looked out and waved for her. She\nrose and joined him, and he lifted Gav and handed the boy to his governess,\nwho stood with the guards.\n“Nobody enters,” Dalinar said.\n“Pardon, Brightlord,” one of the guards asked, “but why are we here?\nWhat are we doing?”\n“It’s an experiment that could be dangerous,” Dalinar said. “It could take\nus as long as an hour or so.”\nThey nodded. Dalinar and Navani shut the thick door behind them,\nstanding in one of the tower’s water cistern rooms. Wit strolled through the\nroom, noting where water poured out of pipes in the walls to crash down\ninto the cistern. He said something, but she couldn’t make it out over the\ncascading water.\n“What was that?” Navani said.\n“You didn’t hear?” Wit said, strolling closer. “Excellent. We are unlikely\nto be overheard, and this place is acceptably remote and secure.”\n“Yes, but what did you say?” Navani asked.\nWit smiled, then turned to Dalinar. “You’re certain you want to try this?”\n“I am,” Dalinar said.\nWit turned to Navani.\n“As am I,” she said.\n“Very well,” Wit said, fishing in his pocket. “I’ve thought of the perfect\nvision for your experiment.” He tossed Navani a small rock, which she\ncaught, frowning."

The type you either\nhad to quarry for, or had to Soulcast. She held up the rock for Dalinar.\n“And this is?” Dalinar asked.\n“Rock from Ashyn,” Wit said lightly. “Like those carried by your\nancestors to this world during their migration. They were fragments of a\nholy site on your homeworld, but stones themselves took on a kind of\nmystical lore by association. That sort of thing happens when the world\nundergoes repeated cataclysms and society gets knocked back to the stone\nage a few dozen times. Some seven thousand years later, everyone in\nShinovar worships rocks, and has no idea why.”\nNavani gaped at him.\n“What?” he asked.\n“Have you told them?” she asked. “Shared their heritage, their history\nwith them? Have you written this down?”\n“I keep meaning to …” Wit said, and shrugged.\nDalinar turned the rock over in his fingers. “You just have one of these?\nDid you steal it?”\n“Hmm?” Wit said. “No, I picked it out myself, right before the\nmigration.”\n“To Roshar,” Navani said.\n“Yes.”\n“You were there?”\nAgain Wit shrugged. “Look, I can’t be expected to tell you everything\nthat has happened in the last ten thousand years, all right? Yes, I was there.\nCan we focus on the experiment?” He pointed at the rock. “We want an\neasy vision as a test. A particular event chosen by us, not preselected by\nHonor or the Stormfather.”\n“Yes,” Navani said. “That’s correct. We need to observe historical events\nas they truly happened.”\n“Specifically,” Wit said, “you will eventually need to be able to find the\nhistory I missed in order to determine what led to Honor’s demise, and see\nif you can find why the power refuses Vessels now. First, we should start\nwith something familiar to me. Hence the rock.”\n“The … rock,” Dalinar said. “Wit, I still don’t follow.”\n“I explained this,” he said. “If you go into the Spiritual Realm without\nsome kind of anchor or guide, there’s no telling what you will see. Events\nthat you think about, that are a focus of individual or collective trauma or\npassion, are most likely—but really it could be anything. You could dip in\nthere and end up being shown an extended vision of a kindly old man\nfeeding his axehounds. For hours.”\nWit pointed at the rock again.\n“So …” Navani said, sorting through the flood of information he’d given\nher. “This rock is an anchor to Connect us to a specific moment, and draw\nus to that specific vision?”\n“That’s correct,” Wit said. “Namely: the arrival of humankind upon\nRoshar.”\n“That’s what we’re going to see?” Dalinar asked softly. “Storms.”\n“If it works, yes,” Wit said. “Ideally, only your minds will be taken, your\nbodies staying here.

Since I was there, I can authenticate that this has worked.”\n“A control for the experiment,” Navani said.\n“Exactly,” Wit said. “And with Dalinar’s clock already attuned, you\nshouldn’t get too wildly affected by time dilation. You should avoid coming\nout having aged twenty years—though be careful, it still might be easy to\nlose track of the days. With that, you can see how much time is passing\nhere, so keep an eye on it. Enjoy the vision for an hour or so, then I’ll call\nyou back.”\nDalinar nodded firmly.\n“Wait,” Navani said. “How do we come back? How do we even initiate\nthis? What are the mechanics?”\n“Tether yourselves here with a line of power,” Wit said. “Dalinar, you’ve\ndone it before.”\nNavani observed as he drew in Stormlight, then knelt and infused the\nground with it. When he stood, a line of light anchored him there. With his\ncoaching she was able to draw strength from the tower, then press it into the\nground. Like an experiment with osmosis and diffusion.\n“That line of light will act like a rope,” Wit explained. “So you can be\npulled back should you slip in too deep. You should be able to see those\nlines of light in the vision, and pull on them to come back yourselves. In an\nemergency, I can contact you through them.”\n“All right …” Navani said, shivering. “Now what?”\n“Now,” Wit said, “you open a perpendicularity, and combine all three\nrealms in a single point. You pass through, sending only your mind.”\n“How though?” Dalinar asked.\nWit folded his arms, standing at the edge of the rippling reservoir. Light\ndanced on the ceiling, reflected from the glowing gemstones set in the\nwalls, just beneath the surface. Looking at him, she sensed something\nprimordial about the man. His smile faded, his eyes profound, as if holding\nthe darkness of the cosmere before light sparked.\n“I don’t know,” Wit said softly.\n“You don’t know?” Dalinar said. “You said—”\nNavani laid a hand on his arm, quieting him, and looked to Wit. The\ndeity who insisted he was not.\n“Every time I’ve done this,” Wit said, “I’ve been at one of the pools.\nWells of power that grow around the presence of gods, a kind of … natural\nspring, grown of their power. When you step into such a well, you can feel\nthe bond that gods have to the Spiritual Realm. You can see a little into the\nplane where they exist—where their thoughts move at many times the speed\nof mortals’. I can feel that place calling me. Perhaps it knows I rejected it\nonce; I am the fish that escaped the hook.\n“I can share that feeling, rather than a specific list of instructions,\nDalinar.

It is not much, but you’ve asked for my help, and I give what\nI have.” He met their eyes. “I warned you of the danger. There are few paths\nin this universe I fear to walk. This is one of them.”\nNavani met Dalinar’s eyes. He sighed, but then nodded. “Let’s open the\nperpendicularity,” he said, “and feel it out.”\nAt Radiant’s urging, the group flew toward the Bondsmiths. They left\nBreteh’s three squires behind to watch and give warning if someone came\nthrough one of the gateways.\nThey soared through the halls of Urithiru, and as they did, Radiant\nreached out to brush the wall. It felt solid. This corridor was populated by\nhundreds of tiny candle flames hovering in the air: the souls of the people\nliving and working in Urithiru. There were also a great number of spren,\nwhich on this side were like wildlife—the fauna that populated Shadesmar,\nattracted to, perhaps feeding on, the emotions and experiences of the\nhumans on the other side. They were only visible in the Physical Realm\nwhen something intense let them manifest.\nPerhaps it was the bond that drew them. The bond to people—like\nRadiant spren, or the spren of her armor, which kept up with them\nsomehow, rolling across the ground and sometimes flying between gaps.\nThere was something to the bond that drew spren, invigorated them. Like\ncremlings hiding in shalebark, Shallan thought, smiling, remembering\ndrawings she’d done during a more innocent time.\nThere was so much to be studied about the symbiosis between spren and\nhuman. Someday when all this was done, that would be her project. Jasnah\nthought her a whimsical artist, and that was part of her. But so was the\nscientist. She dreamed of creating a grand illustrated tome explaining the\nintricate details of the bond. Shallan’s ultimate triumph in proving that art\nand science were actually one.\nThe Windrunners landed them at a stairwell heading down. The\nBondsmiths had gone this way—indeed, they shone through the glass floor\nup ahead. The three guards and one of the Windrunners went first to check\nthe way, leaving Renarin to step over to her and whisper.\n“I saw a vision,” he said, “right before you arrived. Rlain thinks it’s Ba-\nAdo-Mishram. What we’re doing here is dangerous, and I need to talk to\nShallan about it.”\nSo, reluctantly, Radiant stepped back. And hoped they wouldn’t get too\ndistracted by whatever he had to say.\nThe tower on this side was overwhelming to Renarin. While Rlain hummed\nto the place’s beauty, Renarin kept focusing on how many things were\nmoving all at once. The walls of shimmering crystal, light catching on\ncorners like it did on a prism. Then there were the spren. Flocks of them,\nmany the size of minks or even axehounds, scurrying down every hallway,\nhanging from the ceiling, making shadows that reflected through walls,\nadding to the visual cacophony.\nThough spren looked different on this side, he was pretty sure those"

Gloryspren flitted around on wings, with glowing spheres\nfor heads. But what were the ones that had six arms and gripped the walls,\nwatching with a large drooping mouth that seemed to have eyes in it? The\nthings that were shaped like anemones? The darker shadows, hulking and\nthreatening, that he kept glimpsing through the glass walls?\nStorms. As he pulled Shallan aside, he searched his pockets for\nsomething to fiddle with. He came out with a couple of spheres, which he\nspun in his palm, and he tried to focus on the clicking sound the glass made.\nShallan undid her hair band and fanned out her hair before replacing her\nhat. Her lips parted as she glanced one way, then the other. It was nice to\nknow he wasn’t the only one to find this terrible and overwhelming …\nShe grinned like a madwoman. “This is amazing,” she said. “I can’t\nbelieve I haven’t come in here before!”\n“Didn’t you just get back yesterday?”\n“I should have made time,” she said, pointing. “Storms! What are those!\nI should sketch those. The ones with the spines? They don’t look like any\nspren on our side. Usually there’s some physical clue to what they are.”\nDespite her words, she didn’t get out a sketchbook. They started down\nthe steps, a Windrunner and Rlain ahead of them. Renarin kept the spheres\nin his hand, clicking them together, and went over what he wanted to say.\nSpelling it out in his mind.\n“So, you wanted to talk?” Shallan asked, eyeing another spren above\nthem, through the transparent ceiling.\n“Yes,” he said, deliberate. “Ba-Ado-Mishram. Rlain thinks we saw her in\na vision.”\n“I think I did too,” Shallan said.\n“What?”\n“Odd things happen with Lightweaving,” she said. “Particularly if\nyou’ve bonded two spren at the same time.”\nTwo spren. “Wait. That’s not just some … friend of Pattern’s?”\n“The deadeye?”\nDeadeye? He peered ahead at the other Cryptic. Was that what the bent\ntines in the head meant? He hadn’t looked closely, as … well … this place\nwas so demanding and exhausting. He simply couldn’t help but see\neverything.\n“Two spren,” he said, fixating on that. “You have two spren. I didn’t\neven know it was possible. Why would you bond a second on your trip?”\n“It’s a long story,” Shallan said.\nThat seemed like a promise of more, but then she didn’t continue.\n“Anyway,” Renarin said eventually—again organizing and focusing his\nthoughts as a group of strange purple spren rolled down the steps next to\nthem. “You said this Unmade was in the Spiritual Realm. And you said my\nfather is opening a perpendicularity to travel there.”\n“Which the Ghostbloods know about,” she said.\n“So we tell him not to!”"

Besides, Renarin, when has your father ever reconsidered because\nany of us made an objection?” She focused on the lights ahead. It appeared\nthat his father and Aunt Navani had entered a large chamber at the end of\nthe corridor. “I can finally stop Mraize—for once I know exactly where he’s\ngoing to be. I just have to be there watching for him.”\n“But this spren,” Renarin said. “Shallan, I think she’s something terrible.\nWorse than the Unmade that caused the Alethi to hunger to kill each other\nin battle for centuries. Worse than the one that killed Aesudan and\nconsumed Amaram. Worse than … anything.”\n“So we absolutely need to stop the Ghostbloods from getting to her.”\n“Or maybe we shouldn’t be involved at all,” Renarin said. “What if by\nmeddling, we lead to her being freed. All the effort we took to lock away\nthe Thrill? Someone took that effort and more to lock Mishram away. If\nshe’s in the Spiritual Realm … maybe your enemies can’t find her, Shallan.\nMaybe the prison is strong enough.”\n“I can’t simply let Mraize do whatever he wants, Renarin.”\n“And me?” Renarin said, feeling Glys thrum within him. “Shallan, you\nspecifically fetched me.”\n“Because you might be able to spot others who have bonded corrupt …\num … reborn? Remade? Sja-anat’s spren.”\n“I think you can do that as well as anyone could,” Renarin said. “You\ntold me Mraize had bonded one of Sja-anat’s Enlightened spren because\nthey could guide him in the Spiritual Realm. Then you came to find me.\nWhy, Shallan? Why really?”\nShe kept her eyes forward. “Mishram’s prison is compromised. The\nGhostbloods knew precisely where to send agents to get the information,\nand have intel on how to reach the Spiritual Realm. And their spren … their\nEnlightened spren … can lead them through that realm.”\n“So you are going to try to find the prison,” Renarin said. “That’s why\nI’m here. You hope Glys can guide you!”\n“I don’t think I thought it through that much,” Shallan said. “I’m\nworking on instinct. Look, we should catch up to the others.”\nShe quickened her step. Renarin forced himself to keep moving along\nthe short hallway, trying so hard to ignore all the lights, the motion. It was\n… it was loud. Not loud to the ears, loud to every sense. It made him want\nto put his hands around his eyes and block out most of the stimuli, to cut\ndown on how much was reaching him.\nI will help? Glys said. I will try?\nThe spren … darkened things. Dampening the lights at the perimeter of\nRenarin’s sight, like what happened in a vision, where everything went\nblack.\nIt did help, and he was able to pull himself together and make his way\nforward after Shallan and the others.

Shallan could be a little like a sudden river after a highstorm.\nA flood that could carry you until it ran out, leaving you stranded. Adolin\njust went along with it.\nIs she right? Renarin asked Glys. Could you help us on the other side, in\nthe Spiritual Realm?\n… Yes, Glys said, sounding hesitant as he pulsed. Yes. I think I could. I\nwill.\nThat was a small comfort, but Shallan did seem frightened of these\nGhostbloods. Renarin didn’t think they could do anything to his father—\nhuman souls appeared as glowing flames on this side, but there was no way\nto interact with them. Yet they didn’t know all the permutations of what\nanti-Light could do, and …\n… and he kept going, despite knowing he was trapped in a Shallan flood.\nBecause if he turned back, then Rlain probably would too, which would\nmean leaving Shallan completely without access to common sense.\nDon’t be unfair, he told himself. She’s done a lot of good for your family.\nA year of having her as a sister-in-law had shown him she could be a deeply\nsensitive and caring person, and she loved Adolin with an enthusiasm that\nnone of the other women ever had. Beyond that, she had a remarkable\nhandle on life, considering the way her fragmented mind sometimes\npresented challenges.\nIn short, despite first impressions, he had grown fond of her. However,\nthat didn’t mean he liked the way that she worked by instinct. Accidentally\njoining a secret organization bent on ruling Roshar, then never finding a\ntime to mention it to anyone until it became a crisis? In his experience, that\nwas the most Shallan thing she could have done.\nUnfortunately, a glow was building ahead of them at the end of the\nhallway; his father was preparing the perpendicularity. But … there wasn’t\nanyone here. The room they reached was a perfect replica of the one in the\nPhysical Realm, only made of the same shimmering glass as everything\nelse. He could make out the souls of Aunt Navani and his father, glowing\nbrightly from their Connections to powerful spren—and another soul,\nwhich had to be Wit, shimmering with a great number of odd colors. Glys\nconfirmed it.\nOtherwise, the room was empty … Wait. What were those two souls\nover at the side, in the walls?\nShallan set the three guards at the door and stepped in with the spren,\nRlain, and the Windrunners. There, she stood with her hands on her hips. “It\nseems impregnable. A hallway ending here? Walls we can see through, and\nno other humans in sight? Did I misjudge?”\n“Those two souls over there might be spying on Father and Navani,”\nRenarin said. “Could that be them?”\nShallan spun to follow his gesture. “Storms, maybe the Ghostbloods\nslipped past in the Physical Realm? It’s possible they transferred with a\ngroup of soldiers on the Shattered Plains.”\n“What do these Ghostbloods look like?” Rlain said, inspecting the souls.\n“Maybe we can identify them.”"

Two wear strange masks most of the time, and are\nforeigners. The third is Thaylen, though he dyes his eyebrows and keeps\nthem short. He has scars across his face, and …” She paused, then glanced\nat Renarin. “They would have spren with them. Maybe hiding within their\nhosts, as yours do?”\n“Tumi says that is likely,” Rlain told her. “Any spren can learn to do it,\neven on this side.”\n“And their powers?” Renarin pushed. “Sja-anat can make any order of\nRadiant save Bondsmith, assuming the spren are willing. And a lot of them\nare, Shallan. She offers a different option, a third option. So what powers\nshould we be watching for?”\n“Well, one can transfer between Shadesmar and the Physical Realm,”\nShallan said. “So they might be waiting on the other side for the\nperpendicularity to open, then plan to pop in here and enter it from this\nside.”\n“Good,” Rlain said. “That gives us something to prepare for.” He knelt\nbeside the wall. “These two souls … they seem to be hiding in an air duct.\nAnd what is that green spot …”\n“Mmm …” Pattern said. “Cultivationspren. That is Lift.”\n“Spying as usual,” Shallan said, folding her arms. “So maybe that’s not\nthem.”\n“What else should we be looking for?” Renarin asked. “Could one of\nthem be a Lightweaver?

Remind me, what do you do when there’s a guard\nwatching for you?\nStorms. You became the guard.\nUnfortunately, Mraize saw her looking through the wall at him, and\nknew they’d been spotted. A second later the three Ghostbloods burst\nthrough the door, still wearing their false faces—though Mraize had pulled\na dagger out. One that glowed and warped the air.\n“Protect the spren!” Shallan shouted, pointing. “Those three guards are\nthe enemy!”\nThe room became chaos. Three Ghostbloods pretending to be common\nAlethi guards faced two Windrunners and their spren, along with Renarin,\nRlain, Radiant, Pattern, and Testament. So many figures suddenly moving,\nresponding, or panicking.\nMraize raised his dagger and stayed back, though when the dagger got\ntoo close to his side, it made the Lightweaving spark and rip apart. Iyatil\nand Lieke leaped for Breteh, perhaps identifying the Windrunner as the\nstrongest.\nRadiant moved, shoving past Pattern and trying to get to Breteh, who\nclashed with Lieke, holding back his dagger. Nearby, Isasik—the other\nWindrunner—tackled Iyatil.\nStorms, no, Radiant thought, pulling to a stop. There was no way Isasik\ncould handle Iyatil. Indeed, the woman spun expertly and grabbed the\nyounger Windrunner by the arm, slashing in a single smooth motion. She\ntossed him aside, blood spraying from a slit across his neck.\nRight then, Dalinar’s perpendicularity opened.\nPower thrummed through the room, pulsing with the energy of storms,\nand Shallan felt it surge through her like hot water in her veins. She gasped\nin awe, and outside the room spren began to scramble and scratch at the\ndoor.\nIyatil jumped for her, knife—fortunately a conventional one—bloody.\nRadiant separated from Shallan then, fully armored despite being in\nShadesmar—formed of Lightweaving given physical weight. Radiant\nsnatched Iyatil straight from the air, then slammed her to the glowing\ncrystalline ground.\nIyatil grunted and slashed at Radiant, the weapon bouncing ineffectively\noff the Shardplate. It wasn’t real, but was anything real on this side? What\nhad made this entire tower, if not raw Investiture from the Sibling?\nRadiant pinned Iyatil down by one arm—but the Ghostblood performed\nan expert wrestling twist and slipped away. She spun around Radiant—who\ntried and failed to grab her.

Testament hid behind Pattern, who\nstood with one hand to his chest, pattern spinning, like a woman whose\ngarden party had just been spoiled by unexpected rain.\nAs Iyatil struck, Shallan dodged backward, blessing Adolin for his\ninsistence on training her in knife combat. As she had expected though, this\nwas a feint—Iyatil slid another knife from her sheath and kept her hand\nback as if to hide it. This one warped the air.\nShallan had been wrong about them only having a little bit of anti-Light\n—there had been one bolt, but at least two daggers. Shallan continued to\ndodge, passing Isasik, whom Renarin was helping sit up after healing. A\nsecond later, Breteh—careening in an uncontrolled Lashing—came\ncrashing past. Iyatil dodged, and Shallan saw her chance, bringing Radiant\nin to tackle the woman, forcing her to drop the dagger—which went\nskidding across the floor.\nWhile Iyatil quickly slipped out of Radiant’s grip again, Shallan was able\nto scoop up the dagger. She glanced up, met Iyatil’s furious gaze, then\nsmiled in triumph.\nA second later, Shallan took a blowgun dart to the eye. She stumbled\nback and barely managed to dodge—through the pain—as Iyatil sent more\ndarts after her. When had the woman gotten out that blowgun? Shallan\nscrambled away, making illusions of herself to distract, and pulled the dart\nfree.\nPuffing, she assessed the situation. Isasik had been healed but still sat on\nthe floor, right hand to his bloodied neck. Lieke was facing Rlain and one of\nthe Windrunner honorspren. The female who had spoken earlier, wearing a\nuniform and carrying a light dueling sword—which she wielded effectively\nto force the outsider up against the wall, then run him through.\nShallan nodded in appreciation—so far, Maya and Notum were the sole\nspren she’d known with the air of soldiers. But it stood to reason there\nwould be others, particularly among the honorspren who had chosen to\ncome and form bonds rather than hide in Lasting Integrity.\nThe Ghostbloods were losing this fight. They might be better individual\nwarriors, but they faced five Radiants, plus the spren and Shallan’s\nillusions. Radiant backed Iyatil into a corner, and Lieke—who didn’t appear\nto have a spren—died in the attack, falling limp and covered in blood. As\nquickly as the ruckus had begun, it was over.\nAs Adolin had warned her so many months ago, combat was often short,\nbrutal, and overwhelming. Years of training came down to a few key\nclashes.

They will be executed unless I give a signal. Or you get\nto them first.”\n“She’s toying with you, Isasik,” Shallan said. “Don’t let her get inside\nyour head.”\n“It’s true,” Mraize said from the ceiling. “You know I wouldn’t lie about\nthis, little knife.

It was\ndifficult to make anything out as the perpendicularity raged—washing out\nthe room with brilliant white light. Spren in the distance were going\nhaywire, a thousand shadows dancing up on the ground floor. But she could\nmake out that warping. That light that somehow repelled natural light—\nincluding that of the perpendicularity—in a bubble around Mraize’s hand.

As if she didn’t care that people saw she was growing up?\nThis version of her didn’t seem afraid of anything.\nLift reached for that version of herself, her fingers barely visible in the\nlight, and she thought she felt a comforting song flow through her. And that\nhand. On the shoulder, with tan skin and painted nails … so familiar.\nThough the rest of the figure was invisible, Lift knew that hand, so soft\ndespite its calluses.\nIf she could just hold it one more time …\nBut there was no substance to this vision. And Lift knew, confronted by\nthis at last, something she’d been lying to herself about. She didn’t believe\nher mother was dead. Oh, she said it. She said it over and over, the way her\ngreat-uncle had always sworn by the name of the god he hated. In case that\ngod was watching, in case fate was checking on her, because if you said it\nthen nobody would ask what was really in your heart.\nShe didn’t believe; she physically couldn’t. Her mother would hold her\nagain, and life would be warm. But Lift … she couldn’t change. What if\nMother returned and didn’t recognize her? What if Mother looked for her\nand didn’t see her, so found some other little girl to love?\nLife had been perfect for a few months. Why couldn’t it have stayed that\nway?\n“Lift?” a trembling voice said from behind her in the shaft. The vision\nvanished. “I’m scared.”\nWyndle? But no. That was …\nShe turned sharply, and saw Gavinor in her shadow, gazing past her into\nthe room where Navani and Dalinar were opening their perpendicularity.\nFrom the wall next to her, Wyndle’s vine formed a mouth. “Oh dear.

Did\nyou know he was following us?”\n“Of course not,” Lift hissed. “Gav! What are you doing!”\n“You said,” the boy whispered, “we have to learn when to obey and\nwhen to not obey. I saw you sneak in. This is a time to not obey?” He\nshrank further before that light.\nStorms. It was one thing to be caught peeking in on important meetings.\nIt was quite another to be caught corrupting the starvin’ crown prince and\ngrandson of the starvin’ Bondsmiths. They’d string her up. Worse. They’d\nstop letting her steal their desserts.\nShe tried to shoo Gav back down the small tunnel, but he was frozen in\nplace. With a sigh, she twisted around so she could push him back before\nher. She’d miss whatever awesome thing Dalinar and Navani were doing,\nbut whatever. She startled a strange purplish cremling as they crawled.\nThose things were all over in the air shafts. She wondered what they tasted\nlike boiled, but had never managed to catch one. She also wondered if\nanyone else suspected what they really were.\nShe got Gav moving at last, and everything was fine until Navani gave a\nshout—and the light started to pull them toward it. Lift screamed as she slid\nbackward through the tunnel, pushing hard on the walls to stop herself, but\nthen Gav collided with her, shoving them both out into the room.\n“Mistress!” Wyndle cried. “Oh my! Mistress!”\nAir rushed around them in a roar, rivaling the sounds of the waterfalls\nthat had made listening in so difficult. With the powerful light blinding her,\nshe lost track of where she was—and Gav slipped from her grip.\nThey were … they were both being pulled toward that rift. Sliding across\nthe rough ground, bumping over stones. In her panic, she tried something\nshe’d never managed before.\nShe became un-awesome. Instead of slipping freely, she tried to make\nherself grind against the ground, maybe stick. Unfortunately, the friction\njust made her flip upward instead. She flew through the too-bright air\nstraight toward the rift—\n—until someone seized her by the arm and held her, a figure that cast a\nshadow in the wrong direction. A man all in black, grunting, struggling\nagainst the powerful rift until finally the perpendicularity vanished.\nLift slumped to the ground, dropping like a kite with no wind. She could\nbarely see anything, just shapes and shadows, though her vision quickly\nbegan to return.\n“Thanks,” she muttered.\n“You’re lucky I sensed you watching again,” Wit said. “I almost missed\ngrabbing you from the air. You both owe me.”\nShe relaxed, and Wyndle came scuttling over.\n“Oh! What was that!” Wyndle said. “Master Hoid, what happened?”\n“I wish I knew,” Wit said. “Their anchors are gone. And … well, so are\nthey.”\n“Wait,” Lift said, opening her eyes. “They went in, like, totally? Bodies\ntoo?” Whenever she’d snuck into Dalinar’s visions, she’d left her body\nbehind."

Bodies\ntoo?” Whenever she’d snuck into Dalinar’s visions, she’d left her body\nbehind.\n“Yes,” Wit said. “And you? No thanks for the rescue? Figures.”\nLift frowned at that until she saw the cremling from earlier fluttering\naway on wings that could barely hold it in the air. So when Wit had said\n“both” of them, he’d meant …\nLift sat bolt upright. “Gav!”\n“What?” Wit asked.\n“Did you grab Gavinor? He was sneaking through the tunnels behind\nme!” She leapt to her feet, searching around. “You saved him, right?”\n“I didn’t see him,” Wit admitted.\n“Why not!” she shouted. “You saw me!”\n“Lift, you’re so highly Invested I’m surprised normal people can’t feel it.\nYou glow so brightly to my life sense that you outshine anyone nearby.\nYou’re sure Gavinor was here?”\nShe nodded, then the two of them looked—slowly—toward the bare\nportion of stone where the portal had been.\n“Well, shit,” Lift said.\n“You heard that from Zahel, haven’t you?” Wit said, his eyes growing\ndistant.\n“Why do people keep saying that?”\n“Rosharans don’t use that particular word as an epithet,” Wit said, his\nexpression still strange as he turned in a slow circle. “You’re only going to\nconfuse people.”\n“The best words are the ones most people don’t understand.”\n“That is literally the opposite of how language should function.”\n“Yeah, ’cuz you make sense all the time. Anyway, what are you doing?\nShould we be panicking?”\n“Design and I are peeking into the Cognitive Realm,” Wit said. “In case\nwe were lucky, and the Bondsmiths dropped into Shadesmar.”\n“And?” Lift guessed.\n“I see the remnants of one corpse—Malwish, by that broken mask—and\na destroyed chamber. That’s curious. But no sign of Gav, Dalinar, or\nNavani. Unfortunately, it seems they did go into the Spiritual Realm.”\n“Which means …?”\nWit focused on her, then drew his lips to a line. “We have to hope that\nDalinar finds his way back in the next eight days.”\n“And if he doesn’t?” She glanced at Wyndle, who had shrunken into a\nsmall pile of vines, whimpering softly. Storms. Gav would be terrified.\nCould she do anything?\n“This complicates everything,” Wit said. “The contract has provisions\nfor Dalinar’s death before the deadline, his stalling for time, or if his arrival\nis prevented by another. But if he doesn’t show up because of his own\nchoices … I believe that will be a forfeit.”\n“Meaning we lose.”\n“Worse,” Wit said. “It will be as if Dalinar broke the contract, violating\nhis oath. As Dalinar represents Honor, the power of which is maintaining\nOdium’s place on this planet … if Dalinar doesn’t show up, that will\nliberate Odium entirely. He’ll be free to rampage in the cosmere again.”\nStorms. Maybe Gav wasn’t the only one in trouble. Except … “Don’t we\nwant Odium to leave?”"

Except … “Don’t we\nwant Odium to leave?”\n“Odium unbound would be terrible,” Wit said, crossing to where the\nportal had opened. He knelt to press his fingers on the stone. “If he weren’t\nbeing held in check by fear of the other Shards, you have no idea the\ndestruction he would cause.”\n“Sure, right,” Lift said. “But we’ve had to deal with him for … like\nforever. Surely someone else can do it.”\nWit didn’t reply.\n“Can you do something?” Lift asked, stepping up to him and squatting\ndown. “Bring them back? The times I cheated my way in, I had Dalinar to\nguide me.”\n“I don’t know,” Wit said softly. “I warned them. I will … try to think of\nsomething that will help. It might take time.” He looked toward the door.\n“That was a knock.”\n“You can hear that over the rush of the water?”\nHe nodded, standing.\n“Do we … tell them?” Lift asked.\n“Depends,” Wit said. “How eager are you to start a massive tower-wide\nriot? Dalinar and Navani are the glue that holds together the nation and the\nRadiants. I think the only thing keeping people from full-on panic is the\nbelief that somehow the Blackthorn will handle the upcoming contest. If\npeople find out he’s gone …”\n“Right,” she said as another knock came, this time louder. “What do we\ndo, then?”\n“We do the smart thing, of course,” Wit said, starting to glow as he drew\nin Stormlight. “We lie.”\nAs night fully took the landscape, Kaladin had to admit defeat. His stew\nwas a disaster. It tasted like crem.\nKaladin had helped Rock dozens of times, though Huio, Lopen, and\nDabbid had proven to be the most capable. Still, it shouldn’t have been that\nhard for him. Just cut everything up and toss it in. Part of the reason he’d\nbrought such a large pack was because he’d requested spices and\nvegetables.\nHe squatted by his little cook pot, a poor substitute for Rock’s great\ncauldron, frustrated. Maybe more pepper? He sprinkled it in and tried the\nmess, which now tasted like slightly spicier crem. He groaned in frustration\nand slumped on his rock. First moon was up, illuminating Szeth as he lay\non his back on the grass—no bedroll, only a blanket as a pillow. He was\nmunching on a ration bar.\n“Not working?” Syl whispered. She sat on a rock nearby, full sized,\nviolet-fringed ko-takama skirt rippling in the wind.\n“It just needs to simmer,” Kaladin lied.\n“Did you use … chunks of ration bars in that?”\n“Needed meat. Ration bars are basically jerky.”\nPerhaps that hadn’t been the best choice. But, well, maybe … maybe if it\ncooked longer? He halfheartedly offered up another pinch of spice to the\nbubbling pot. But storms, he’d taken so long that Szeth had already eaten\nhis own dinner. The whole point of an evening stew was to draw people in,"

The whole point of an evening stew was to draw people in,\ngetting them to open up as they ate something unexpectedly good.\nOnly Szeth didn’t seem to care about what tasted good.\nTry anyway, Kaladin thought at himself. Dalinar asked you.\n“So,” Kaladin said, turning away from the fire to face Szeth, “this is your\nhomeland.”\n“Obviously,” Szeth said.\n“Your house anywhere close?”\n“Nearby,” Szeth said.\n“Want to visit?”\nSzeth shrugged, his eyes now closed. “There is nothing for me there.”\n“Still might help.”\n“I told you that I need no help.”\nKaladin turned and stirred the stew, mostly to be doing something. “I\nused to think that too,” he said, loud enough Szeth could hear from behind.\n“Actually, I used to say it. I always knew I needed help. Part of you does\ntoo, Szeth. It’s not weakness to admit it. We can quiet those voices.”\n“You misunderstand,” he replied. “When I say I do not need help, it is\nnot because I lack the ability to recognize my faults. It is not normal that I\nam chased by the voices of the dead. Likewise, I recognize that others are\nnot so daunted by decisions as I am.\n“When I say I need no help, it is because this is how I should be. I have\nmurdered many innocents. I chose to follow the broken traditions of a\npeople who were so scared of the Truth, they exiled me rather than face it.\nBecause of this, I deserve suffering. It is right. If you were to heal it, you\nwould do something immoral. Therefore I tell you I do not want your\n‘help.’ Leave me alone.”\n“It’s not immoral to stop hurting, Szeth,” Kaladin said, looking back\nagain.\nSzeth just closed his eyes and didn’t respond.\nDamnation. Kaladin gritted his teeth. Then he forced himself to get out\nthe flute and lay Wit’s paper explanations in front of him. He needed\nsomething to relax him, and maybe this would help.\nHe was wrong.\nIt had been barely a day since Wit had shown him the positionings, but\nKaladin fumbled as he tried to replicate them. He first couldn’t make a\nsingle sound. Then what followed was a breathy, weak noise, nothing like\nthe beautiful and light music Wit had made.\nAfter a half hour of stubbornly trying to play, Kaladin tossed the flute\ndown—causing it to stick in the soft soil like a knife in wood. He heaved\nhimself off the rock by the fire and stalked out into the night, kicking at the\nstupid grass as it refused to get out of his way.\nSyl stepped up beside him in the moonlit darkness. She was better at\nbeing of help than he was, because she knew to stay quiet while he breathed\nin and out, trying to exhale away his frustrations.\n“I can’t do this, Syl,” he said. “The only thing I’ve ever been good at is\nwar. Even when I was forced on leave, I found a way to fight for the tower.\nI am useless unless I’m killing something.”\n“You know that’s not true.”"

Even when I was forced on leave, I found a way to fight for the tower.\nI am useless unless I’m killing something.”\n“You know that’s not true.”\n“But I don’t,” Kaladin snapped. “I’ve always been too good at killing.\nYou recognize that; it’s what drew you to me.”\n“I was drawn,” she said, “to willpower, determination, and a desire to\nprotect. Yes, I like the way you dance with the wind when you use a spear,\nbut it’s not the killing, Kaladin. It never was.”\nHe didn’t respond, staring off into the darkness.\n“This is your dark brain talking,” she said. “You weren’t killing when\nyou rescued Bridge Four. You pulled thirty men out of the darkness and the\nchasms, then you forged them into something wonderful.”\n“Yeah,” he said. “I forged them into killers.”\n“A family,” Syl said. “Don’t try to distort it. I was there, Kaladin. You\ndid it because you couldn’t stand to let them keep dying. You did it out of\nlove.”\nHe glanced to the side and saw her staring at him indignantly, full sized,\nimpossible to ignore. Storming woman. She was right.\n“Szeth,” she said, “is no more hopeless than they were. You remember\nhow unwilling Rock was at the start?”\n“Yeah,” he admitted, thinking back to days that—though excruciating at\nthe time—were now fond to him. Sneaking through the night with Rock and\nTeft, fetching bundles of knobweed. Hearing Rock laugh for the first time,\ndescribing what he’d done to Sadeas’s meal.\nThey were both gone now. Teft dead. Rock maybe executed by his\npeople. Still, Kaladin forced the dark thoughts behind him and presented\ngood thoughts, like soldiers with spears, to keep them away. Syl was right.\nHe could claim many things about himself, but he couldn’t justify the\nargument that he was only a killer. And life was good. He had felt it earlier.\nIt didn’t banish the darkness, but active thoughts, as counters to it, really\ndid help.\n“I just don’t know what I am anymore,” Kaladin said softly, more\nhonestly, “or who. If I’m not a soldier, what is there to me? Wit told me to\nfigure it out, but that terrifies me, Syl. I can’t be a surgeon like my father\nwants. I’m not one for a quiet life seeing patients about their bruised arms\nand strange coughs.”\n“What about their bruised minds,” Syl said, “and strange thoughts?” She\nlooked back toward the small fire.\nRemarkably, Szeth had decided to try the stew. Oh, storms. Kaladin went\nhurrying over with an excuse ready.\nSzeth had finished his bowl by the time he arrived. “I would eat this\nagain, if you made it.”\nKaladin frowned. Had … simmering it made it work? He tried a bite,\nand found it exactly as bad as before. Except, well, it was probably better\nthan field rations. Jerky with mashed-up, dried katfruit wasn’t the most\nappealing meal either.\nKaladin had been comparing his stew to Rock’s masterpieces. An\nimpossible benchmark.

But when the sole competition was field rations …\nSzeth stood up, then nodded to the darkness that was the basin of\nShinovar. “This is wrong.”\n“Wrong? I don’t see anything.”\n“There should be candle lights,” Szeth explained. “Fires at the\nhomesteads and villages. I see only darkness. It’s like they’ve all simply\nvanished …”\nKaladin stepped up beside him, gazing out at the ocean of black.\n“I … lied to you earlier,” Szeth admitted. “I do love my people, Kaladin.\nMy exile makes it feel like I don’t care about anything, and sometimes I tell\nmyself I don’t deserve to care. But … the exile was—for so long—my\nproof that I love them. I want to help my people. That is … more important\nto me than the quest, though that makes me a bad Skybreaker.”\n“We will help them, Szeth,” Kaladin promised.\n“Perhaps we will start by visiting my family homestead. To … see if it\nshows us anything.” Szeth handed back his bowl, then walked off and lay\ndown, pulling his blanket over himself and turning away from Kaladin.\nWell, that hadn’t been the laughter over a stewpot Kaladin had wanted,\nbut it was something. He settled down and ate a bowl, finishing off what\nwas left in the pot. He tried not to compare it to Rock’s stew, and it helped.\nHe didn’t want to get into the habit of lowering his standards, but\nconversely, never being willing to reassess was just as bad. Maybe he was\nexpecting too much from Szeth too quickly. Kaladin had been patient with\nBridge Four. He could show the same patience here, despite the tension of a\nworld close to breaking.\nWith that in mind, he decided to pick up the flute and give it another go.\nHe walked a distance away to not bother Szeth and forced himself to\npractice, and felt wind blowing across him as he did. A peaceful wind, of\nthis place, where the grass wasn’t afraid. A wind he found comforting.\n“Is that you?” Kaladin asked, lowering the flute.\nYes, the Wind whispered in his ear, causing Syl to perk up where she’d\nbeen sitting on the ground nearby. The music the ancient one taught you …\nit calls to me …\n“I’ve done as you asked,” Kaladin said. “I’m here. I’m still not sure why,\nbut I’m here. Can you tell me?”\nOdium changes. His goals change. I … can speak now … when it was so\nhard for years …\n“That has to do with Odium?” Syl asked.\nHe changes. His attention is not on me, the Wind said. The Stones have\nalways had the capacity to speak, but only now started doing so. I am\nalways here … Now I warn. Odium is made anew. This is dangerous.\nStay … Watch. I will watch too.

It was a fresh wound. He couldn’t fixate on it, he knew. Not\nand become a new person, like Wit said.\nEventually he went back to the flute. The Wind didn’t return, and his\nmusical attempts were just as pathetic as they’d been earlier. But storm it,\nthere was one thing that was reliably true about Kaladin Stormblessed.\nRegardless of his job or his location, even if you took away his ability to\nfight … he was still the most stubborn fool of a person who ever lived.\nSo he kept right on blowing awful notes on that flute. Right until he\nlooked up and found the Herald Ishar standing in front of him.\nThe tower was strange on the other side. Really strange. And Lopen was,\nsure, an expert in strange things. He had plenty of strange cousins. He\ncollected them.\nSo, he could say with authority this place was strange. Non-strange\nplaces didn’t glow. It was like an entire building had become Radiant,\nsucked in some Stormlight, and was now threatening to stick Huio to the\nwall.\nAnticipationspren followed him like a posse as he and the other two\nWindrunners walked to the site of the explosion. This place was a perfect\nreplica of the tower, only made of glowing glass stuff. The tower said\nwaking it had restored it to its natural state. Which made Lopen wonder\nwhy his arm wasn’t made of glowing crystal on this side. That would be\nmuch better than the fleshy one. Not that he minded—it was good to have\ntwo arms again, as now he could eat chouta and point at things at the same\ntime.\nBut a glowing crystal arm would be pretty deevy.\n“You think,” he asked, “if I thought about it a lot, my arm would turn to\ncrystal?”\nRua, his spren, shrugged. On this side, Rua was around three and a half\nfeet tall—with messy hair, boundless energy, and the proportions of a child.\nHe liked to skip rather than walk, and Lopen had heard that in his home\ncity, Rua could float around all the time. Huio found it fascinating, and was\nalways talking about it.\nThoughts of floating spren and crystal arms evaporated as Lopen reached\nthe site of the blast. “Here, sir,” Isasik said. “We were in here …”\nA smoking, broken chamber. All four walls had been cracked, and the\none by the hallway had been completely destroyed. The crystalline ground\nhad been blasted open in a pit, and the ceiling was a fractured web.\nOne broken corpse lay among the destruction.\n“You’re certain?” Lopen asked.\n“Yes, sir. When I returned to help after rescuing the guards, this is what I\nfound—with that one dead man, who was so broken it made me worry …”\n“What?” Lopen said. “That the others ended up as person-mush?”\nIsasik looked ill, but nodded.\n“There ain’t no person-mush in here,” Lopen said. “This blast was big,\nbut not big enough—sure—to leave us without some kind of sign. Honestly,"

Honestly,\nI expected to encounter some Shallan bits as we walked up that hallway.\nPleasant to not find any.”\n“So …” Isasik said.\n“So, we have to assume they went through the perpendicularity,” Lopen\nsaid. “Or otherwise escaped.”\n“That would transfer them back into the Physical Realm though,” Isasik\nsaid. “None of them are there.”\nLopen didn’t reply. Something was up. Navani wasn’t talking, and so the\nSibling wasn’t talking, but he could smell it when something strange had\nhappened. He was an expert in strange. The literal walls had secrets.\nImportant, terrible secrets.\nWhich was super-okay with Lopen. If important people had it in hand,\nthen he didn’t need to worry!\n“I’m going to assume others have it covered,” he told Isasik. “Come on.\nWe need to fly the Mink’s people to Herdaz.”\n“But—”\n“If they’re dead, can we do anything for them?”\n“Well, no,” Isasik said, floating down to check on the dead man, who\nwas very, very dead. Enough remained to tell it wasn’t any of their friends.\n“If they escaped,” Lopen continued, “and don’t want anyone to know,\nwill we help them by outing them?”\n“No,” he said. “You know how Lightweavers are …”\n“If they vanished into another realm, dimension, or place, is there\nanything we can do for them?”\n“No,” Isasik said, floating up again. “That would take a Bondsmith.”\n“So we report back,” Lopen said. “We’ve searched to make sure they\naren’t being held captive. Now we have to assume it’s all going to work out,\nbecause whatever is going on, it’s bigger than we are.”\nWith that, he started toward the Oathgates. Rua hurried to catch up with\nhim, and the spren—storm him—had a glowing crystal arm now.\n“Show-off,” Lopen said, then hesitated and spoke more softly. “What do\nyou think happened to them, naco? Why isn’t Navani more worried?\nRenarin is her family, and Shallan too. Navani shrugged at the news; she\ndidn’t even put down her chouta. Have you ever seen her shrug before?” He\npaused. “Have you ever seen her eat chouta before?”\nRua pointed up at the distant sun, just barely visible through the\nrefracting glass of the tower walls on this side.\n“The sun?” Lopen said. “No … the realm beyond, where gods live. You\nthink they really went there?”\nRua nodded enthusiastically.\n“Well, Damnation,” Lopen said. “I guess, sure, they’re at least in the\ncorrect vicinity for some divine help …”\nIt was him.

Almost like\n… like he was a prototype for the religious order that had come after. Blue\nrobes. Golden sash. Heavy bracelets.\nBut there was more unseen. The way the hairs on Kaladin’s arms stood\nup. The way the last vestiges of wind had suddenly vanished. The way the\nman could look at Kaladin and seem to see too much. That air … the very\nway he stood … reminded Kaladin of Ash, one of the other Heralds.\nIshar stepped toward Syl, his eyes narrowing. She raised her chin and did\nnot grow small, though he suspected she wanted to flee. A part of Kaladin\ndid too—wanted to be away from the gaze of this being who wasn’t entirely\nhuman.\nBut this was why he’d come.\n“I do not … know you,” Ishar said, turning to Kaladin. “I know every\nother piece moving on this board.

And to Szeth, my servant.\nHow?”\nKaladin steeled himself. “I was sent to help you.”\n“What help needs a god?” Ishar asked.\n“We all need help sometimes,” Kaladin said. “Do you … sometimes feel\noverwhelmed? Like you can’t trust your thoughts?” Storms. Did that sound\nsilly?\n“Dalinar sent you,” Ishar said. “I see now. He wants to confuse me,\nconvince me I am not a god. I do not need your help, child. Your master has\ndone enough damage already.”\n“Damage?” Syl asked.\n“Damage,” Ishar said, turning to regard the lightless, rolling Shin hills.\n“Your Bondsmith pretender attacked me. Changed me. I … saw things I\nthought I’d forgotten. In that moment, Tezim died, but I need that name no\nlonger. I can be Ishar, who Ascended to the position of the Almighty.”\nDalinar had mentioned this. At the instant Navani had become a\nBondsmith, Ishar had seen into the Spiritual Realm and grown lucid for a\nshort time. So … was there an aftereffect here? Was he doing better?\nDalinar had mentioned oaths. If another were sworn near Ishar …\nperhaps he would return to himself. An unconventional means of therapy,\nbut maybe …\nMaybe Kaladin needed to appeal to the Herald, instead of the man. The\nHerald who had defended humankind for so long.\n“Ishar,” Kaladin said. “We need your help.”\n“Yes,” he said. “Your enemies crush and outmaneuver you because you\nhaven’t come to me. I have plans to deal with them, and the greater threats\nbeyond. Become my disciple, and I will show you.”"

Become my disciple, and I will show you.”\n“We can … talk about that,” Kaladin said, glancing at Syl for support.\n“We have Ash and Taln with us, back at Urithiru. Your friends.”\nIshar sniffed. “Useless. Both of them.” He met Kaladin’s eyes. “Do you\nknow what I do for them, child? I founded the Oathpact, so I can siphon\nsome of their pains onto myself. I bear their darkness. Each of them would\nbe crushed by it, were it not for me. You’ve seen Taln? He is insensate, so in\nthe thrall of the darkness?”\n“Yes,” Syl said.\n“That is because I do not bear his darkness as I carry the others,” Ishar\nsaid. “They would all be as helpless if not for me. I am the conflux of all\ndarkness and sorrow. Their pains are upon me. And still I stand before you.\nI am a god.”\n“I just want to—” Kaladin said.\n“I had not foreseen you, but perhaps I should have, considering your\nspiritweb and Connections.” He nodded toward Szeth in the distance.\n“Szeth has come to fulfill the task I set for him many years ago. His path\nwill be difficult. If you would have my ear, prove to me that you can be of\nservice.”\n“In what way?” Syl asked.\n“In helping me prepare for the end,” Ishar said softly. “The Truthless has\nreturned at last. This land needs him.”\n“Ishar,” Kaladin said. “I want to talk about the way you feel. Um … I\nwant to—”\n“I will speak to you,” Ishar said, “when the pilgrimage is finished. When\nthe task is done.”\n“But—”\nIshar’s eyes came alight, glowing as if with Stormlight—but manyfold.\nBeams of light that blinded Kaladin as he roared. “I\nF YOU WISH FURTHER\n, , ! T\nAUDIENCE WITH YOUR GOD THEN SEE HIS WILL DONE CHILD HIS IS THE PRIVILEGE\n.”\nOF ANY DISCIPLE\nThe light faded, and Ishar was gone.\nStorms.\n“Great,” Syl said. “That went well.”\n“Well?” Kaladin said. “He spouted nonsense at me, refused to listen,\nthen vanished.”\n“He also didn’t vaporize us or anything,” Syl said, floating a foot or so\nup into the air, shining softly in the darkness, hair blowing once more as the\nbreeze returned. “And he’s crazy—so, you know, some nonsense is\nexpected. He noticed you and offered you a chance to talk to him again.”\n“He’ll talk to us again,” Kaladin said, “if we help Szeth do … whatever\nit is he’s supposed to do? We don’t have any idea what that is!” He ran a\nhand through his hair, but calmed himself. “That said, he seemed … a little\nbetter than Sigzil and Dalinar described him. I think.”\n“We can help him, Kaladin,” she said, resting incorporeal hands on his\narm. “We can try to help them all.”"

If Ishar won’t talk to me until it’s over …”\nBut, well, Wit had warned him. There was a task here that was greater\nthan bringing Ishar to Dalinar—a task the Wind needed him to complete.\nPreserve a remnant of Honor …\n“What did he mean?” Syl wondered. “He said that Szeth was his servant.\nHow?”\n“Who knows,” Kaladin said. “He calls me a disciple and thinks he’s the\nAlmighty.” He took a deep breath and packed up his flute, his music papers,\nand his gemstone light. “But … I guess you’re right. That could have gone\nfar worse, and we can ask if Szeth has any thoughts tomorrow. For now\nthough, I need some sleep.”\nThey hiked to the campfire, where Szeth was snoring quietly. Kaladin\npacked up dinner and banked the fire, absorbed in his thoughts. They tried\nto turn dark, but he kept battering them back with positive thoughts, like\nsoldiers fighting on his behalf. Reminders that he had succeeded in the past,\nand could succeed again. Reminders that an idea wasn’t true just because it\nentered his head.\nThe darkness was still there and wanted him to believe things would\nnever change, but this little victory proved the opposite. Because while he\nmight never be rid of the thoughts permanently, he was done letting them\nwin.\nTHE END OF\nDay Two\nEl, who had no title, stepped up to the Kholinar palace vault. Four Regal\nsingers had been placed there as guards—a position of honor. Hopefully\nthey would not fall too far after this.\n“You will open the vault for me,” El said to no rhythm.\nThey didn’t question. That pleased him, as he never liked to kill mortals\nwho served well. Their emotions did them credit. Still, he’d assumed they\nwould know not to obey orders from him. He’d thought the Nine would\nhave made that clear the moment he was reborn, but they were distracted\nwith their war.\nSo, unwitting, the four Regals hummed to Subservience, unlocked the\ndoors, and opened them for him, bowing. When he entered, their leader—an\nenvoyform—hurried in after.\n“I am to accompany all who enter, great one,” the Regal said, bowing\nagain. “Pardon my intrusion.”\n“What is your name?” El asked.\n“Heshual,” the Regal said.\n“One of our names,” El said, strolling through the small chamber—\nwhich someone had begun to line with aluminum sheets. “What was your\nname before?”\n“It was … Govi, great one.”\n“Do you miss your old name?”\n“No?” the Regal said.\n“So timid,” El said to no rhythm. “You were passionate enough to\nbecome a Regal in this Return?”\n“I …” Heshual hummed to Tribute, which was a ridiculous rhythm to\nuse for this exchange.\nEl picked through the room, ignoring stores of gemstones, seeking a"

He stoked his annoyance, cherished it as all emotions should\nbe. He did not channel it at this Regal, however, for El understood the\nreason for the timidity.\n“It is all right,” El said. “I assume one Fused noticed your passion and\nput you up for elevation—but since then, others have reprimanded you for\nstanding up for yourself. Now you don’t know the proper way, because\nsociety is in shambles and my kind refuse to be proper role models.”\nThe Regal hummed to Craving. A sign of agreement, and wanting more\ntreatment like this. He got that rhythm right.\n“My kind wear thin, like shoes walked upon for too many miles,” El said\nsoftly. “My honor was stripped in part because I warned of the signs. We\ncannot rule much longer.”\nHe found what he was seeking at last, on a shelf near the back of the\nvault: a specific gemstone, still attached to its dagger. Jezrien’s prison. El\ntook it off the shelf, reverent.\n“Be careful, great one,” the Regal said. “That is a dangerous weapon.”\n“Oh, I know,” El said, taking one of the new anti-Stormlight gemstones\nfrom his pocket. He lifted it up, appreciating Raboniel’s handiwork. Then\nhe touched it to the tip of the dagger, which pulled the anti-Light out and\nsent it into the gemstone prison.\n“Great one!” the Regal said. “That will … That …”\nEl held up the gemstone, where a Herald’s soul had been trapped. It\nflashed as anti-Light met Light, and Jezrien was at long last destroyed. Not\nmuch of an explosion; barely enough to crack the gemstone. There hadn’t\nbeen much of Jezrien left.\nNow even that was gone. Forever. “Goodbye, old friend,” El whispered\nto no rhythm.\nThen he looked at the Regal, who gaped at him, horrified, fearspren\nappearing at his feet.\n“That imprisonment,” El said, tossing the dagger away, “is a punishment\nnone deserve. We shame ourselves by trapping, instead of destroying, a\nHerald.” He held up his anti-Light gemstone, still almost full. “Yes, you\nwere already nearly gone, weren’t you, old friend? The prisons don’t work\non humans as well as was thought …”\nThe poor Regal was cycling through rhythms like a person beset with\nmadness. The soul of a trapped Herald had been by far the most valuable\nthing in the vault.\n“You should run to the Nine right now,” El suggested. “If you are quick,\nthey might not punish you. The fault is theirs for not warning you about me.\nAnd perhaps I bear some fault. For being me. Naturally.”\nThe Regal scrambled away, calling for the other three to watch El and\nnot let him leave. Fortunately for them, he had no wish to depart. He settled\ndown on a bench at the side of the chamber, wondering at the way many\nhad changed names.

Or\na betrayal of the culture they’d possessed in the absence of the ancients?\nBefore more guards arrived, he felt a presence overshadow him. Odium.\nWhat have you done, servant? the familiar voice said, vibrating El\nthrough his gemheart. An act of treason by one of the Fused?\nEl did not reply. He considered that voice.\nIt was almost right.\nWell? Odium said.\n“I see you,” El replied softly with no rhythm. “I know you for what you\nare. And what you are not.”\nThe old Odium had come to hate being challenged. Perhaps that was\nwhy the Fused were so erratic—after thousands of years trapped on Braize,\nunable to fulfill his plans, their god had become erratic first.\nThe new Odium pondered. Who are you? Ah … I see. Yes, curious. I had\nnot paid enough attention to you, El.\n“Do you have his memories, then?” El asked.\nI can view them if I desire, though I do not see why you would name\nJezrien a friend, yet destroy his spirit.\n“In all your divine wisdom,” El said, “you cannot imagine a situation\nwhere a friend deserves to die?”\nThe new Odium laughed. A legitimately joyful-sounding chuckle.\nCurious. In a blink, he appeared beside El and waved a hand, slamming the\nvault door to lock out approaching guards. This Odium was human, elderly,\nand did not care to make himself larger than El to intimidate him.\nThat was more than curious. That was impressive.\n“I have a problem,” Odium said. “Would you help me solve it?”\n“As a test?” El asked. “Or a legitimate need?”\n“Let it be both,” Odium said, strolling through the vault, studying objects\none at a time. He wore the enveloping clothing many humans preferred—\ncovering most of the body, never letting skin or carapace through. A way to\ndisplay the ornamentation of skilled labor.\n“I would hum to Subservience,” El said, “if I had rhythms still.”\n“I will accept that,” Odium said. “I have a plan to capture the entire\nworld, and am confident in my ability to secure Thaylenah and Shinovar. As\nfor Azir, my predecessor left an army that had been heading toward Lasting\nIntegrity, which I was able to turn. It lacks Fused, and now lacks surprise,\nbut I think it should be sufficient to claim Azimir. But the Shattered Plains\ntrouble me.”\n“I believe,” El said, “you have sent great numbers of Fused to the\nlocation.”\n“Is that odd of me?” Odium asked, pausing beside a stack of gemstones,\neach large as a fist, on a shelf.\n“I have been told,” El said, “that the term to use with a divinity is not\n‘odd,’ but ‘inscrutable.’”\nOdium smiled again. He tapped each gemstone in turn, and they glowed\nwith Voidlight—soft purple-on-black.\n“If you have sent so many Fused,” El continued, “and continue to worry\n—then I’d ask what is so important about a wasteland.

Thaylenah is a\ntrading hub, vital for controlling the seas. Azir is the seat of an empire, and\nof great cultural and scientific development in this era. Both greater prizes.\nBoth facing lesser armies.\n“One might guess this is about proximity. For example, getting those\nFused to Azimir in time might be impossible. And you are confident in your\nplan for Thaylenah. So a reasonable person might assume that you sent the\nFused to the only remaining location of note.”\n“Are you reasonable, El?”\n“Rarely.”\nOnce again Odium smiled. “I would like to bring further forces to\nsupport the Shattered Plains. How would you do this?”\n“How much of a cost am I to assume I’d be willing to pay?”\n“A steep one.”\n“Then you already know the answer,” El said. “As the solution is a part\nof you.”\n“Dai-Gonarthis is dangerous to unleash,” Odium said.\n“Despite that,” El said, “if you require an Elsegate, she is the sole option\n—unless you have access to corrupted Elsecallers or a proper Honorblade.”\n“I have neither yet,” Odium said as he walked back to El. “You have\ntraveled with the Black Fisher before.”\n“Yes,” he said. “Most of the lands you’d want are still protected from her\ntouch, but Natanatan … Perhaps. You would need a strong source of\nInvestiture on either side. And someone to lead your armies.”\nOdium studied him. “I see you, El, for what you are not. And for what\nyou are.”\nEl bowed his head.\n“If you serve me,” Odium said, “you may need to kill more of your …\nformer friends.”\n“My friends had their chance. When left on this world, they enslaved my\npeople. The Heralds deserve annihilation. It is … a mercy.”\nOdium nodded. “I dub you—”\n“No titles. Please.”\nOdium hesitated, and El saw danger in his expression. So, he was not\nimmune to the rage, and being cut off by someone much lesser crossed a\nline. A worthy experiment.\n“Very well,” Odium said. “I name you ruler, with no title. You will take\nleadership of my armies to assault the Shattered Plains. Travel to the Peaks\nvia shanay-im, and I shall send Dai-Gonarthis to you. Use her … particular\ntalents to take the garrison at the Peaks, and claim the Shattered Plains in\nmy name. I will pay her price another time.”\nThis left many things unsaid. Why Odium was so interested in the\nShattered Plains. How he knew that there would be enough power to\nConnect them to the well at the Horneater Peaks.\nThe solution to both unsaid questions was likely the same. El again\nbowed his head. “The Nine will not care for my elevation.”\n“And what are your thoughts on the Nine?”\n“I think of them little, and when I do, I think little of them. Master.”\n“Then they report to you, El. Help me claim this world.”\n“If I do, can I rule human lands for you?”"

Help me claim this world.”\n“If I do, can I rule human lands for you?”\n“If that is your wish, I will grant it.”\nExcellent. El bowed. “I will not fail, lest I be destroyed.”\n“El, I do not throw people away for failure, unless it came about by their\nnegligence. Adopt this policy. Even in failure, it is often not the tool, but the\nwielder, who is at fault.” The god began to fade, evaporating to dark mist.\nHis voice lingered. “We have much work to do. Not just on one world, but\nmany.”\nFascinating. El had walked in here expecting imprisonment, probably\nexecution and forced rebirth. Instead it seemed he was leaving with an\narmy, a promise, and a new god who might at last be able to conquer the\nentire cosmere.\nWhat an enchanting day. In his head, he began to compose a poem to\ncelebrate this new god he was delighted to worship. Someone who, he\nsuspected, would know the value of what he had—and would let El help\nhumankind finally realize their true passions.\nHe put Jezrien’s former prison back on the shelf, then tossed his anti-\nStormlight gemstone into the air and caught it again while walking to the\ndoorway, enraptured at the thought of how the Nine would react.\nTaravangian could save them. All of them.\nHe strode, unseen, through Kholinar, now capital of a growing singer\ncivilization. He could see this whole land, and knew its new leaders were\nnot perfect. In that, they were no worse or better than the humans; while\nmany of their policies were more egalitarian, this was also a people who\nhad been enslaved. He felt their complicated emotions, both wanting to be\nbetter than their slavers and being enraged at what had been done to them,\nsometimes lashing out.\nThat rage was his greatest resource. With it, he would bring order to the\nentire cosmere. He held his hands to the sides, feeling the rhythms of the\ncrowds who passed him, unable to see their god. He was still the one\ndivided: a mind that wanted to plan, a heart that fought against that\ncalculating coldness. Right now, the heart wanted to simply accept peace.\nBut it could not abandon Alethkar, not after all the work these singers had\ndone to claim it and build a home.\nIt was theirs. They deserved it.\nThat was the logic speaking. People were in pain. He could retreat his\nsingers to Jah Keved, and there be content.\nJah Keved had basically no armies. How would he bring order to the\ncosmere without armies?\nDid he have to?\nYes. He did.\nBack and forth, back and forth. He partially wondered if this was the\nreason Cultivation had positioned him to be elevated—in giving him his\ncurse and boon for so long.

Cultivation had not given up on\nhim, and would not do so easily. Together they stood in the center of a\nmajor thoroughfare—palanquins lumbering past, laborers hurrying by in\nclumps, tradesmen shouting out wares. Human and singer living together in\na delicate balance. Uncertain, like the one inside him.\n“Would you like to see?” she said. “What I can show you?”\nHe calmed his rage at her. Wisdom dictated that if she wished to give\nhim something, he should at least witness it. He nodded.\nShe led him to gaze upward, toward stars only they could number. He\nstood rooted on Roshar—he could not visit these places, but he could see\nthem. With her help, he was given a new perspective on how she thought it\nshould be, each Shard in their realm of influence, governing their own\nlands.\n“It does not have to be one god,” she said. “One solution will never work\nfor all. That was part of why we had to do what we did, ten thousand years\nago. Let them be, Odium.”\nHe saw something different from what she wanted him to see. He saw\nthat gods could indeed be afraid. Of him. The power of Odium, with his\npredecessor, had killed several of them. That version of him had been too\nbrazen, and had left itself wounded in a clash. Taravangian could certainly\ndo better.\n“Taravangian,” she said, “do not learn the wrong lesson. See.”\nHe saw. Gods who turned away from him, content to let the danger stay\ntrapped. Interestingly, they considered all three of the gods of Roshar to be\na problem, and were happy to leave them to their conflict.\nThis was perfect.\nIsolated as the others were, he could watch and prepare exactingly how\nto defeat each one. Only one of them held two Shards of power, but that one\nwas unable to function properly. Odium’s predecessor had never taken a\nsecond Shard of power for that reason.\nThese can be defeated, he thought, seeing the permutations of possibility.\nThey will regret ignoring me.\nHe kept his thoughts from Cultivation as she tried showing him peaceful\nnations on many planets. He instead was most curious about the fact that\ntwo of the Shards appeared to be missing, completely vanished from\ninteracting with the others. Hidden. One he understood with some effort.\nBut Valor—where had Valor gone, and how did she hide from even his\neyes?\nThe tour over, he and Cultivation pulled their focuses back down to\nRoshar. The greater cosmere was a part of Taravangian’s ultimate plans, and\nhad to be. But for now, this people here—this world—had to be his\neverything.\n“You worry me, Taravangian,” Cultivation said as they stood unseen\namong the people of Kholinar. “If I can admit it, you always worried me. I\nknew what I had to do, but I wish it could have been any other.”\n“If there were not something to fear about the person you chose,” he\nsaid, “then they could not have taken up Odium.”"

Listen to that part of you. Give it a chance.”\nAnd …\nDespite himself, he did feel it. It was the part of Taravangian that loved\nhis daughter and grandchildren. The part of him that had grieved when\nforced to manipulate Dalinar while trying to break up the coalition. It was\nthe part of Taravangian that remembered being young, uncertain, dull—\nyearning to do more to help his people.\nThat was the Taravangian who had been given the chance to have\nanything he wanted, and had wished for the capacity to stop the coming\ncalamity. In a moment, Taravangian felt as if … as if he were that same man\nhe’d been long ago.\n“Very well,” he said, turning from her. Not in shame—he would not\naccept that emotion now—but in … compromise. “I will try.”\nHe was a god divided. What if he let each side rule in turn?\nThe time has at last come for our stewardship to end.\nAs Adolin transferred to Azimir, he heard the overlapping, echoing voices\nof the spren of the Oathgate.\nUse this time well, human, they said. When our new allies arrive, we will\nstop aiding you.\n“And when my father wins his contest?” Adolin asked, appearing in\nAzimir. “Will you help us again then?”\nWe shall see. For now, our transformation approaches.\nWell, the enemy was still an hour or so away. There was time enough to\ntransfer the rest of Adolin’s forces to Azimir. After that, they would be\nisolated here until the reinforcements arrived.\nHe emerged onto the Oathgate platform along with a small group of\nleaders from the Cobalt Guard—including Colot, the tall former\nWindrunner squire with flashes of red in his hair. Adolin took a deep breath,\nremembering how much he liked the smells of Azish spices from the nearby\nmarket. With a pat to calm Gallant, Adolin inspected his surroundings: a\nlarge dome with gaps in the bronze ceiling to let in light. The Oathgate at\nAzimir had been a sheltered marketplace before the discovery of Urithiru.\nNow the stalls had been torn down, leaving a wide expanse of stone.\nThis would be his battlefield: a space well over two hundred yards\nacross, with a control building at the center. The huge bronze dome was\nslightly larger than the platform—essential so that it didn’t transfer when\nthe people did. There was a large wooden balcony halfway up the wall,\nmaybe thirty feet in the air, surrounding the entire dome. He squinted,\npleased to see Azish archers in position up there. Unfortunately, singers\ntended to be more resilient against arrows than humans because of their\nnatural carapace armor."

Unfortunately, singers\ntended to be more resilient against arrows than humans because of their\nnatural carapace armor.\nAdolin inspected the round control building. Maybe twenty-five feet\nacross, that room was the sole incursion point from Shadesmar. When going\nfrom Urithiru to a city, you could use the whole platform—but when\ntraveling to or from Shadesmar, you could only transfer from within the\ncontrol building, something that had come as a horrible surprise to Adolin\nin Kholinar. He’d hoped to save the soldiers he’d been leading by\ntransferring them all—but he, in the control building, had instead gone\nwithout them.\nThe entire place felt like a bunker. He turned around, examining the\ndome, and noted some interesting sacks hung high in the air along its\ninterior. Oil, he guessed, to drop and burn on any enemies who might\ntransfer here. Another good precaution, but also one that might not work as\nwell against singers as the Azish hoped.\nOur most important task, Adolin thought, is to not let them claim ground\ninside this dome.\nIf the enemy could take the dome, then they’d have a large, fortified\nstaging area in Azimir. The defenders would need more than archers and oil\n—they’d need boots on the ground inside the dome, keeping the enemy\nfrom seizing the entire thing from within.\nInteresting, Maya said in his mind.\nShe had been changing quickly, ever since their visit to the tower. A\nliving Urithiru appeared to have invigorated her, and had also somehow\nstrengthened whatever was happening between them. She said the Light of\nthe tower made her feel refreshed, and he felt her in his mind stronger now.\nShe could see into the Physical Realm through his eyes, including when he\nhadn’t summoned her as a Blade, and she’d been responding more and\nmore, even volunteering comments.\nYour Herdazian general, she said. He was worried about this defense.\n“The Mink. Yeah,” Adolin whispered. “I can see why, but only if I look\nhard. On first glance, this seems easy. A good killing field, the enemy\ntrapped in this dome, only one small incursion point. We could guard the\ndoors of that control building and just slaughter singers as they appear, then\ntorch the entire place with oil if they manage to break out of the center.”\nSo what’s the problem?\n“Singers attack through aggression and momentum,” Adolin explained.\n“They’re not formation fighters—they usually flood across a battlefield in a\nrush, fighting in expert pairs trained to defend one another. We often have\nsuperior tactics, but each of their soldiers is stronger, tougher, and harder to\nkill than a human.\n“Our strength is large-scale troop formations. If we try to surround the\ncontrol building and fight them in a tight ring as they come at us—my gut\nsays they’ll break through because we’ll be fighting them their way, pitting\nthe aggression of a few singers against a few humans.”\nThe best way to defeat singers was with large pike blocks and shield\nwalls—although there was barely room for that, he thought it would be\npossible. Particularly if they dumped a bunch of debris in here to slow\nenemy advances. That would give his men a kind of barricade."

That would give his men a kind of barricade.\nHe gazed again at the control room. Azimir’s had eleven openings in its\nround wall, reminiscent of a gazebo. If he were the enemy, he’d send\nthrough Fused and Regals first—and overwhelm the small ring of\ndefenders, winning space for the next groups of troops to transfer quickly in\na flood. If this wasn’t handled well, the humans could lose the entire dome\non the first day.\nThe fire, though, Maya sent. From above.\n“Oil,” Adolin said. “But if it drops, we lose the dome. Remember last\nyear, when we burned the fields along the Alethi border—back when we\nwere trying to push out of the Unclaimed Hills? That’s a common Alethi\ntactic, but the singers simply ran through the fire. They’re not immune to\nheat, but they’re better at handling it than humans.\n“I bet dropping oil in here turns this place into an oven, which would\nlikely kill a wave of singers. But they’d be able to send the next wave in\nmuch sooner than human defenders could return—plus, fire would likely\ndestroy those archer balconies. We can maybe burn the place once—but\nwhen we do, we’re giving up the dome for good, and the singers can use it\nto gather their strength and pour out into the city.”\nHe nodded to himself. The key was to keep them contained and fighting\nfor each foot of space in the dome until human reinforcements arrived. The\nenemy had a much larger force, but he could stall, make them bleed for\neach step. That oil was an absolute last resort. Defensive siege tactics were\ngoing to fail if the humans tried them here—they needed battlefield tactics,\nwith troops on the ground. They could not allow the enemy to fill this\ndome, like a blister waiting to pop, because they would find a way to break\nout—and with so few defenders, the city would inevitably be lost.\nI think you have a good point. Singers … singers use intimidation, speed,\nand force. They’re like heavy cavalry, in infantry form. You need a stout line\nto … to break them.\n“Maya,” he whispered, “that’s the most I think I’ve ever heard from you\nat once!”\nTactics. Strategy. Thinking about it helps me focus.\nOnce Adolin’s officers had inspected the battlefield enough, he got them\nmoving toward the exits. Needing no reins to lead him, Gallant trotted at\nAdolin’s side.\n“What do you think?” Colot asked softly, jogging up to Adolin. “Good\nkilling field in here.”\n“How far do you think those Azish archers can shoot, accurately, into\nbattle?”\n“In here, with this light?” Colot said. “The Azish use the shorter, isri-\nstyle bows—they pack a punch, but don’t have the range of something like\nan Oldblood longbow. I’d put them at a hundred yards. They could stretch\nfarther, but I wouldn’t count on them being accurate beyond that.”\nSo if Adolin put his armies around the control building at the center, they\nwouldn’t have archer support.

        "text": "So if Adolin put his armies around the control building at the center, they\nwouldn’t have archer support. Another good data point. At the edge, ten-\nfoot-thick stone walls supported the bronze dome, which held the wide\nexits, meant for carts and wagons. The Azish had built up the exits: instead\nof a simple door, you had to walk through a stone corridor some thirty feet\nlong, with a bend at the middle—even a little nook going the wrong way—\nto slow and momentarily confuse aggressors. Adolin could see sunlight\nshining into the stone hallway through arrow slits built into the walls. It\nwasn’t truly a maze, not with just one turn, but hallways like these were\ncommon for protecting castles.\n“Your thoughts?” Adolin asked Colot as they followed Azish guards\nthrough the hallway.\n“This fortification is solid,” Colot said. “And we’re low on manpower. I\nsay we let them break themselves on these walls, with arrows raining from\nabove. I could hold these hallways against a superior force for months if I\nhad to.”\n“Against singers?” Adolin said. “With Fused who can fly up to the\nbalcony? Or what if they build ramps up to it and start breaking out that\nway? What if they have some Magnified Ones who can tear holes in the\ndome, or a stolen Shardblade to cut new exits?”\n“Storms,” Colot said. “Storms, you’re right. We can’t let them take the\ninterior of the dome. But what should we do instead?”\n“We’ll see what the Azish commanders think.”\n“You should take command,” Colot said. “You have the most experience\nfighting singers.”\nAdolin shook his head as they reached the end of the hallway. “We don’t\nlead here, Colot. We come to help, not control.”\nTogether, he and his officers stepped out into the sunlight, and the breeze\ncaught his cape, making it flutter.\nYes. He was wearing a cape. It wasn’t standard. It was a little\nostentatious. But Damnation, it looked good with this uniform, and he’d\nwanted to wear a formal uniform cape for literally a decade. Dalinar\nthought they went poorly with regular uniforms—too old-fashioned. He\nwas wrong. It was classic, distinguished, not old-fashioned.\nAdolin’s father thought he was an absolute embarrassment anyway, so\nwhy not throw in the towel on that fight and make some decisions for\nhimself?\nIt is good, Maya said in his mind. It feels right.\n“You’re as old-fashioned as capes are,” Adolin whispered to her, with a\nsmile.\nI am a soldier. I know what inspires soldiers. You look good. It is good.\nEach sentence still felt labored when she spoke, but she made the effort, and\nhe felt her resolve to keep doing so. Like a wounded soldier learning to\nwalk again.\nI’m worried Colot is correct, Maya said to him. Your Azish friends’\ninstincts will lead them wrong here. You might need to take command.\nNo, Adolin thought, testing the ability to merely think answers to her.\nThere will be a better way.\nJust hope, she replied, that our intelligence is accurate, and there aren’t\nmany Fused with the enemy."

Thousands of soldiers lined up\nin ranks, wearing full kit. Striking bronze armor, Soulcast using the imperial\nAzish Soulcaster. Fine steel weapons—spears, swords, and also kattari as\nsidearms. Those thick triangular weapons were between a large dagger and\nsmall sword, excellent for close confines.\nThe soldiers were a brilliant sight: polished armor in the sunlight, each\nwearing a sash over their shoulder and a similar one over their shield—the\ngeometric Azish patterns indicating their battalion. Their helms were\nmarked with different patterns. Seemed to be family affiliations, judging by\nhow each was different from his neighbor’s. But … knowing the Azish, this\ncould also be a mark of how well they did in specific essays or tests to join\nthe military. They were an odd people.\nEffective though, as soldiers. Azir had often fallen to Eastern raids in the\npast—but had just as often held them off. Even the Sunmaker. He’d sacked\nAzimir, but then his army had turned back, unable to hold the entire\ncountry.\n“They report having about three thousand soldiers,” Colot whispered to\nhim.\nNot many at all. Storms, but this would be a strange siege. He’d never\nbeen in a fight where his job was to keep the enemy in instead of out. But\nthe Shattered Plains had been an odd siege as well. He could take some of\nthe lessons learned during five and a half hard years of fighting and apply\nthem here.\nAdolin saluted the Azish soldiers with hand to shoulder, knuckles out,\nthe Alethi way. In turn, they raised their spears. Not a salute—the Imperial\nGuard saluted only the emperor, he’d heard. Or maybe they had a special\nsalute only for him? They had such an odd way of doing things. But then\nagain, who was he to judge? The Azish had the oldest code of laws on\nRoshar, and had been building an empire when the early Alethi had still\nbeen nomadic, according to Jasnah.\nThe leader of the city’s Imperial Guard—Commandant Supreme\nKushkam—came riding up on a brilliant white horse dressed in fine\nbarding. The horse had tassels adorning its head and flanks, as well as a\nspiraling Azish pattern down its legs. More extravagant an equine outfit\nthan any Adolin had ever seen, particularly with that glowing steel barding.\nStorms. The beast could have gone to a royal ball and been the best dressed\non the dance floor.\nGallant snorted. Adolin patted him. “I’ll get you some if you want.”\nCommandant Kushkam was a shorter man, but thick of neck and limb.\nAdolin had asked around, and had discovered Kushkam was well regarded\nas a premier player of the card game towers—especially the more complex\nversion that generals preferred. He was missing an eye and didn’t wear an\neye patch, though tattoos circled the wound like rays of sunlight and\nseemed to spell out something in Azish."

He was missing an eye and didn’t wear an\neye patch, though tattoos circled the wound like rays of sunlight and\nseemed to spell out something in Azish.\nHe looked Adolin up and down from horseback. “I hear,” he said in\nperfect Alethi, “you think you’re going to lead the defense of my city.”\n“Just here to help,” Adolin replied in Alethi, offering his hand. It wasn’t\ntaken.\n“I can use the troops,” Kushkam said. “How many did you bring?”\n“I have two thousand,” Adolin said.\n“Only two thousand?” Kushkam said. “I was hoping for more.”\n“Many are infantry veterans,” Adolin said. “I recruited them myself from\namong our best. Elite soldiers, Commandant. I think they’ll impress you.”\n“My men fight for their homeland,” he replied, leaning down on his\nhorse. “What do yours fight for, Alethi?”\n“The good of all Roshar.”\n“You can say that with a straight face?” Kushkam asked. “I suppose\nthat’s impressive. I’ll take your swords—I’m in no position to reject them—\nbut … well, we will see. I still think you have no stakes here. Either you’ll\nflee when the fighting grows difficult, or …”\n“Or?” Adolin prompted.\nThe man settled back in his saddle. “Or we’ll end up indebted to the\nAlethi.” He hesitated. “Every time Easterners have fought in this city, it has\nended with Azimir being sacked. I don’t think you’re looking for loot—I’m\nno fool, and I have read the reports of Alethi aid in the battles for Emul. But\nI don’t like you being here.” He started his horse forward. “Don’t assume\nI’ll dance whenever you sing.”\nBrusque, Maya thought. We won’t last long in defense if our armies can’t\nwork together.\nThe blocks of troops turned in unison, saluting all of a sudden, hands to\nforeheads. There was only one reason they’d do that—Adolin climbed up\ninto Gallant’s saddle to get a little height, and spotted the emperor’s\nincredibly ornate palanquin coming down a thoroughfare. Yanagawn was\nhere.\nAs the armies waited for it to arrive, Adolin whispered for Colot to\nremain behind, then went for a trot around the perimeter of the large dome.\nHe liked what he found—the dome was in the center of a large open area. A\nwide, flat cobbled space in all directions. The marketplace was apparently\nout here now on most days, but had been disassembled in anticipation of\nbattle. Azimir was a fine city, with grand bronze domes topping the most\nimportant structures. Straight, wide roads. Many clustered buildings, tall\nand thin, for housing—they called them “apartments.” They were in good\nrepair, and sturdy.\nIt was all so organized, as if the entire place had been laid out by Aunt\nNavani. And the number of statues and fountains he saw, accompanied by\nbronze frontings to many of the buildings … well, the place was beautiful.\nThere was heritage here, bespoken in each structure.

And it was full of\npeople watching from buildings or streets. So many civilians, mostly\nwomen and children, as most fighting-aged men had been recruited to the\nwar already.\nThese flooded into the city from the south as battles there raged, seeking\nsafety in the capital. Now war came to them anyway. Storms … he couldn’t\nhelp but remember another grand city full of history and beauty. One he’d\nlast seen from its Oathgate platform—witnessing as the palace fell, the\nwalls crumbled, and the people screamed to him for help. He could still\nhear the soldiers shouting as they carried their wounded to join Adolin …\nHe’d abandoned his own troops.\nShamespren trailed him in the shape of red and white petals. He still had\nnightmares about that day. Imagining those wounded soldiers, stumbling\ntoward the only way out, as an overwhelming force of enemies harried them\nfrom behind. Among them were a few of the loyal Palace Guard that had\nresisted Aesudan, who he had rescued from confinement less than an hour\nbefore. He pictured their captain, Sidin, watching as his prince, his leader,\nhis friend … vanished to safety and left him to die.\nHe gripped Gallant’s reins tighter and completed his circuit. As he’d\nguessed, Yanagawn’s procession had taken its time, and was only now\nsetting up. Adolin’s two thousand were beginning to flow out of the dome,\narriving now that he and the officers had surveyed the battlefield. He would\ndo better here than he had before. It wasn’t merely victory that Adolin\nsought here, but redemption as well. Wrongheaded though that was—\nKadash and his father would have both chided him on that being the wrong\nattitude for entering a conflict—he knew he needed to at least acknowledge\nit.\nHis mother though … she’d have agreed with him.\nThoughts of her were painful these days, and he hated how his fond\nmemories of her were invaded by thoughts of what his father had done. So\nhe tried instead to imagine her blond hair as she’d held him on an early\ncampaign with his father, some border dispute with the Vedens. What would\nshe have told him today?\nCare, he thought. Fight for something, not simply because you’re\npointed that way by a monarch, no matter how beloved.\nIt was something she’d whispered to him, even as he trained, even as\nDalinar insisted Adolin become a soldier. Don’t just fight. Fight for\nsomething—something worthy of your heart. Adolin nodded to himself. He\ncouldn’t save the men he’d left behind. But storms, he could do better this\ntime. He would protect Azimir, whatever it took.\nObviously, the passing of the Dawnshard was the first indication\nthat this event was near. However, we find many other signs.\nEmbarrassingly, Szeth had trouble finding his family’s homestead.\nAfter rising early and breaking camp, Szeth had taken the lead, flying\nthem to the familiar prairie near the ocean where he’d grown up. The smells\nwere right: loam and pollen, with a hint of salty ocean brine. The sights\nwere right: worn paths in the grass, with a few dirt roads; buildings of wood"

The sights\nwere right: worn paths in the grass, with a few dirt roads; buildings of wood\nor soil—strangely empty, but still standing tall.\nHe found it obvious—in retrospect—that many of his people had\nbecome pacifists. It wasn’t too hard to make a mallet out of wood and rope\nfor building homes, but try making a sword without stone or steel. True,\nthere were ancient stone-age weapons he’d seen while training in the\nmonasteries—axelike, with sharpened spikes made from the teeth and shells\nof dead sea creatures. Those could kill, but taking them into battle against\narmored knights with steel blades would be like showing up to a horse race\nwith a three-legged goat.\nSo his people had divided. Soldiers killed, worked metal, cut timber, and\nwalked stone. The farmers and herdsmen … they lived normal lives. Even\nthe people of the cities, who were lazier with their observances, didn’t take\nup weapons. Warfare wasn’t for those with morals. You didn’t kill a man,\nthen refuse to walk on stones. The trick was to find the killers among you,\nthose who subtract, and keep them properly contained and channeled.\nHe told himself this was logical. He needed it to be. Otherwise he might\nbackslide as he had when a youth—and start questioning. He had tried to\nforget those days. Except now he wondered again. If he’d never been\nTruthless, what did that mean … for the things he’d done?\nAnd … and where was the homestead? He stopped at an intersection,\nirrationally distraught. He selected what he thought was the proper path,\nincreasing his Lashing and leading Kaladin above the grass, their passing\nmaking it ripple.\nHad he been gone so long he had forgotten his own home?\nWhy not? the shadows whispered at him. You forgot everything else\nabout who you were.\n“Spren,” he said, “do you know the way I am to take?”\n“I do, Szeth,” his spren said. “But you must find it yourself. These are\nthe rules for your quest.”\nIt seemed they might be speaking of different things. “Can you tell me\nanything of what my quest entails?”\n“Only that you must do as you vowed, and cleanse this land. The\ndefinition of that is up to you.” The spren paused, staying invisible. “You\nwill be required to fight, Szeth. To show how skilled you’ve become.”\n“If it is a difficult fight,” Szeth said, “might I use my second Surge? Nin-\nson-God promised to train me, but I have skill already, from my youth.”\nThe power of Division could set the sky itself aflame. His spren had\ncommanded that he use it solely when instructed.\nThe Skybreakers feared Division. It was related to the fate of the human\nhomeworld, which had been burned.\n“We shall see,” his spren said. “I have been directed to test you.”\n“And how do I pass this test?”\n“When I decide you have. For now, you should conserve your\nStormlight.”\nTo obey, he landed at another crossroads. Here he finally picked out the\nlandmarks and let out an annoyed sigh. Of course. “This way,” he said,"

Of course. “This way,” he said,\nleading Kaladin on foot. “I couldn’t find it because I’m not used to seeing\nall this from the air.”\n“I find it easier from the air,” Kaladin said. “You can see so much more.”\n“Best to conserve Stormlight anyway,” Szeth said.\n“True,” Kaladin said, landing. “But we also can’t afford to walk\neverywhere—this is a big country.” He gave Szeth an upbeat grin, trying\ntoo hard to be friendly, which Szeth found nauseating.\n“I’ve been thinking about what you said last night,” Kaladin said.\n“About your punishment. That you think your … mental state … is\nsomething you deserve.”\n“It is a feature of my exile: I am required to kill unjustly, though I know\nmy actions to be wrong. I take upon me the sin of murder. That is the state\nof the Truthless.”\n“Which you aren’t,” Kaladin said. “You told me you never were\nTruthless.”\n“So the sin of killing is still mine, as I should have stopped it?” Szeth\nsaid, feeling even worse. Walking this path was bad, so close to home. It\nmade him think of a life he could have had. A life where he’d never picked\nup a weapon.\n“No,” Kaladin said. “I mean … Szeth, it’s all a mess. What your people\ndid to you was wrong. Absolutely wrong. You shouldn’t have killed, but we\nneed to focus on the now. Getting you to a healthy place. Then we can\nworry about the past.”\n“He is correct,” the spren said in Szeth’s ear, invisible. “But it is more\ncomplicated than he pretends. You should not carry this pain, Szeth.\nEmotion is of Odium, while Honor is the path of calm understanding and of\nlogical decisions. Promises kept and words followed with exactness.”\nSzeth found something wrong in that, but did not speak it. “My spren\nagrees with you,” he noted, walking the dusty path.\n“He does, does he?” Kaladin said. “Syl would like to hear that. She\ndoesn’t think highspren ever agree to anything reasonable.” He looked to\nthe sky, to where the honorspren—ever flighty and unreliable—was\nfollowing currents of air as a ribbon of light, joined by a pack of windspren\nthat were likely the substance of Kaladin’s armor.\n“I should have performed those killings with a cold, passionless\nunderstanding,” Szeth said, attempting to navigate what his spren had said.\n“Perhaps that is why the whispers in the shadows follow me. When I killed\nthese people I cared too much. I will try to do my duty with less personal\ninvestment.”\nKaladin closed his eyes, breathing out. “Szeth, you still act like you’re\nsome object to be toted around and used as a bludgeon.”\n“I am.”\n“No. You’re a person.”\nSzeth remained silent, worried that if he responded, he would invite\nmore lecturing.

They declared that I was\nthe one who was wrong, and in so doing have perverted the law. Retribution\nmust be administered.”\n“What if instead they’d made a new law allowing them to do what they\ndid to you?”\n“Well, that would be fine,” Szeth said. “Everything would be well.”\n“You see no problem with that?” Kaladin asked.\nInwardly, yes. But that path led to anarchy. He knew for a fact he could\nnot be trusted with decisions.\n“I see no problem with it,” Szeth said.\n“Good,” his spren said. “Men are incongruent, walking contradictions.\nSolely in latching on to something firm, something inflexible, can they be\nguided. There must be a law. To rely on human choice is to rely upon chaos\nitself.”\nThey kept walking, and the smell of dust … of a road blown by the wind\n… that was from another life. He’d forgotten that scent, much as he’d\nforgotten the sound of grass in the wind.\n“All right,” Kaladin said. “Can you at least admit that you’ve made\nchoices? From there, perhaps we can talk about why you’re worth being\nallowed to choose. You decided to follow the law. You didn’t just follow it\nbecause it’s the only way.”\n“Those are the same thing.”\n“They’re not,” Kaladin said, stepping in front of him, then halting.\n“Szeth, you’re breaking apart inside because of the murders you committed.\nRight?”\nSzeth stared him in the eyes for a minute, then finally forced himself to\nnod. “There were some who deserved it,” Szeth whispered, “but many who\ndid not. I saw their fear; I should rather have died than do what I did to\nthem.”\n“So, unless we figure out a way to help you, then you’re going to be in\nthat situation again. You’re going to kill people who don’t deserve it.\nThere’s a better path.”\n“Have you found it?” Szeth asked, genuinely curious. “Have you killed\nthose who did not deserve it?”\n“I …” Kaladin faltered. He broke the gaze, looking toward the horizon,\ncrowned by mountains. “I have. Parshendi—listeners. Soldiers before that.\nSingers.”\n“If you don’t know the answer for yourself,” Szeth said, walking around\nhim and continuing on the path, “how can you presume to lecture me?”\nThis shut him up at last. Kaladin lagged behind as they hiked into the\nwind, toward the southwest. Toward home.\nEventually another voice spoke. Soft, concerned. What about me?

Who liked talking to\nDalinar. He had a kindly way to him.\n“Taravangian,” Szeth said. “Yes. You killed him, sword-nimi. He drew\nyou, and your power consumed him.”\nI’m only supposed to kill those who are evil.\n“He was very evil, sword-nimi,” Szeth said. “I promise it.

And I nearly killed you,\ndidn’t I?\nSzeth glanced at his hand, where the flesh was slightly raised. White-on-\nwhite scars, in a pattern like vines, running up his hand and along his arm.\nThe mark of having wielded the black sword without enough Stormlight to\nfeed him.\n“There are many,” Szeth said quietly, “who would call me evil.”\nYou’re not. I would know. I’ve seen you do good things. You can’t be both\ngood and evil.\n“I believe a man can be both,” Kaladin whispered.\n“Agreed,” Szeth said. “That is the problem. Humans can’t judge this, so\nwe need a higher standard.”\n“Laws made by humans?” Kaladin said. “You truly can’t see the\ncontradiction?”\n“It is the best we have,” Szeth said. “When I chose Dalinar as my guide,\nNin said he wished I’d chosen the law. Perhaps I am starting to see that he\nwas right.”\nIf a human can’t judge good and evil though, Nightblood said, then how\ncan a sword?\nIt was a valid question for which Szeth could not think of an appropriate\nanswer.\nI did kill that old man, the sword said. He’s not the only one. I … wake\nup and people are dead. It was actually me, wasn’t it? All those times …\n“How long has this been going on?” Kaladin asked.\nMy whole life.\n“Which is … how long?” Kaladin asked.\nI … don’t really know. How long do humans live?\n“Sixty to eighty years,” Kaladin said. “More if you’re lucky, less if\nyou’re unlucky.”\nWell, the sword said, Vasher helped make me, and he’s still alive. So I’m\nnot very old, I guess.\n“Vasher?” Kaladin asked.\n“You call him Zahel,” Szeth said softly. “He once visited me to check on\nthe sword, which he named Nightblood. I felt something from him. A\nweight of years.”\nZahel? That’s him. Vasher changes his name sometimes. He never calls\nhimself Warbreaker anymore! I liked that name, but he hates it.

She won’t tell me\nthe reasons, but I assume they’re good ones.\n“You talk to Syl?” Kaladin asked.\n“I,” she said, zipping in alongside them as a ribbon of blue-red light,\nevidently having been listening for a little while, “talk to everyone.”\n“Most of the people don’t even realize you’re around!”\n“I wasn’t referring to the humans,” she said, making herself human size\napparently just so she could roll her eyes at Kaladin. As Szeth walked\nbeside them, she glanced at Kaladin to check whether he had seen the eye\nroll. As he hadn’t, she waited until he looked, then gave a very exaggerated\none. It was so forced, however, that both of them ended up grinning.\nSzeth told himself he was annoyed by this exchange, not jealous of the\nfriendship they obviously shared. Would he have a similar bond with his\nspren, if he had become a Windrunner?\nYou should find Vivenna, Nightblood said. She promised she’d come\nlooking for me if I was stolen! Anyway, I think maybe that ever since I was\nmade, I’ve been … leaving dead people. I … have only recently started to\nthink about it.\n“That seems reasonable,” Szeth said.\n“Um, no it does not,” Kaladin said, turning back to him. “How could you\nnot remember before, Nightblood?”\nI’m not like a fleshy person. My brain, if I have one, is metal. I think that\nmakes me … slow to change. The voice grew softer, with a faint tremble to\nit. I don’t want to kill, Szeth. It doesn’t feel like me.\n“Sword-nimi,” Szeth said, “you are, um, a sword.”\nAdolin says swords don’t have to kill. They can just be beautiful works of\nart.\n“Wait,” Kaladin sputtered. “You talk to Adolin?”\nYeah, all the time. He likes swords.\n“Is there anyone or anything you haven’t been having secret conferences\nwith?” Kaladin asked. “The spren of the tower? The spren of my jacket,\nmaybe?”\n“Both of those are quite fun to talk to, Kal,” Syl said. “But none of us\nhave met the spren who embodies your sense of humor. It hasn’t been seen\nin ages.”\n“Oh please,” he said.\nShe leaned in closer to him as they walked. “It is said that everything has"

And I’m sure\nit’s grouchy somehow.”\nSee, like I said, Nightblood told them. He’d get along great with\nVivenna!\n“Sword-nimi,” Szeth said, trying very hard to keep the conversation\ngoing in one direction instead of seven, “you were created to destroy. It is\nyour purpose. It is not shameful to fulfill your purpose.”\nMaybe you’re right, Nightblood said. But shouldn’t I remember? I’m not\nsupposed to destroy anything that isn’t evil. If I’m not paying attention, who\nknows what could happen?\nKaladin gave Szeth a pointed glance, as if the words of a confused sword\nhad any relevance to their conversation. Fortunately, he was saved from\nfurther blathering as he spotted a white building alone on the prairie.\n“There,” he said. “We’ve arrived.”\nWooden boards complained under Kaladin’s feet as he stepped into the old\nfarmhouse.\nHe felt an eerie sense of familiarity as he ran his fingers along a wooden\ncountertop. Syl—full sized—walked with him, her soft blue glow more\nprominent in the dim light. Kaladin rubbed dust between his fingers. In the\nEast, he’d have expected to find crem overgrowing everything. Not so here,\nbut the musty smells were the same.\nSyl stepped to the doorway, looking out at Szeth—who stood, silent, in\nthe yard. “He needs help, Kaladin. Hearing him speak, I’m more worried.”\n“I’m trying,” Kaladin said.\n“I know,” she said, then turned and glanced vaguely into the air, toward\nthe east.\n“What?” Kaladin asked.\n“Changes are coming,” she said, her eyes narrowed. “I can feel them,\neven if I don’t know what they mean. The soul of the world is …\ncontorting. It’s why the Wind speaks again.”\nStorms. Well, that was ominous. Kaladin crossed the room to open the\nshutters, spilling light across the floor. And he was surprised to see\nsomething in the corner of the room: a single tiny glowing green mote. A\nlifespren?\nIt was the first local spren he’d seen this far into Shinovar. Kaladin bent\ndown to inspect it, and Syl joined him, watching as the mote flickered\nbright then dark, then trembled. Syl gasped.\n“What?” Kaladin said.\n“It’s … it’s afraid.” She held out her hand, palm up, and the little spren\nflitted over to her and hovered above her hand, still trembling. It was\nbasically just a speck of green light—he hadn’t thought such a spren could\nfeel fear.\n“What’s it afraid of?” Kaladin asked.\n“They aren’t intelligent enough to explain,” Syl said. “But I can feel its\nterror.”\nThe end, the Wind whispered, blowing in the window. It fears … what\ncould be … the end of all spren …\nKaladin glanced at Syl, who nodded. She had heard it too."

She had heard it too.\n“Can you explain?” Kaladin asked.\nI … I wish I could …\n“She can feel what I do,” Syl said. “That’s my guess. They all do.\nSomething’s coming, Kaladin.”\nThe little lifespren bobbed off her hand, then floated down and hid once\nmore in the corner.\n“There are so few spren here in Shinovar,” Kaladin said. “Shouldn’t\nthere be lifespren all over this place?”\n“I met a couple of windspren who told me that few spren come here\nanymore. They didn’t know why—they don’t think all that logically. They\nprefer to stay away because it feels wrong.”\n“Do they speak of the ancient spren?” Kaladin asked. “Like the one that\njust spoke to us.”\n“Wind, Stone, and Night,” Syl said. “From before humans arrived on\nRoshar. Few spren remember them, but there are old things here in\nShinovar. Older than the gods themselves …”\nAlso ominous. Kaladin looked back through the one-room building. It\nhad a firepit instead of a proper hearth—probably because they needed to\nuse soil instead of rocks. Storms, how did an entire people exist without\nusing stone?\nAt least they let the soldiers work wood for them, as Szeth had\nexplained. That was how they could have buildings constructed from\nplanks, like this one, held together without a single nail. The place had been\ncleaned out thoroughly. Either Szeth’s family had been given time to pack\nbefore leaving, or scavengers had claimed it all over the years.\nSyl lingered by the doorway, again staring out at Szeth. Kaladin joined\nher. “Hey,” he said to Syl. “I’ll figure out how to help him.”\nShe nodded, her eyes distant.\n“You all right?”\n“Trying to be.”\n“Is it what you said earlier?” he asked. “About old things being in\nShinovar?”\n“Maybe,” she said. “Maybe not.”\nHe chewed on that. “You never did explain to me why you were acting\nso odd during those weeks in the tower. When it was occupied.”\nHer eyes grew distant again. “We seem different from one another, don’t\nwe? You and I?”\n“Yeah,” he said. “You’re literally a piece of a god.”\n“As are you,” she said. “I meant our personalities though. You’re …\nwell, you know.”\n“Gloomy?”\n“Intense. Where I’m … not?”\n“You’re intense,” Kaladin said. “Just, you get excited about things,\ninstead of …”\n“Grouchy?”\n“Don’t tell Szeth I agreed with him. Regardless, your enthusiasm is\ninfectious. Invigorating. Sometimes you’ll get focused on a topic and won’t\nlet it go—which leaves me wondering what I’ve missed. It’s interesting.”\nShe smiled. “I doubt most people would see it that way.”\n“Most people don’t know you like I do,” Kaladin said. “What is it, Syl?\nWhat’s bothering you?”"

Is it bad of me to admit that? I\nwanted to fight, to save the world. The soul of Roshar groaned, and we\nabandoned the battle.” She looked to him, suddenly alarmed. “I didn’t mean\nto say we shouldn’t have. I—”\n“I understand,” he said softly. “It can be both right and difficult at once.”\n“Yeah,” she said.\n“We could …” His stomach twisted. “We could find you another knight,\nSyl. One worthy of you.”\n“Kaladin Stormblessed,” she said, glaring, lifting in the air to be at eye\nlevel with him. In her full-sized form, she was still smaller than he was, but\nsomehow her ability to intimidate was not related to her size. “Don’t you\ndare say things like that.”\n“Syl,” he said, “you started all this. You broke with your kind, came to\nmy world, and sought out someone to refound the Windrunners. You stood\nagainst the will of the Stormfather, subjecting yourself to a near loss of\nidentity, because you knew war was coming—and you wanted us to be\nprepared for it. It isn’t fair you have to sit out the ending.”\n“Fair?” she said, folding her arms. “Your own life hasn’t been fair.\nBesides, something is happening here in Shinovar. We’re the ones sent to\nfigure it out.” She eyed Szeth. “Szeth, and this place, are our duties now.\nWe have to adapt. Both of us, together.”\n“And that’s why you’ve been so different lately?” Kaladin asked.\n“Part of it.” She leaned on the doorframe, hair loose and blowing, skirt\nrippling in a phantom wind he could almost feel. She cocked her head,\nglancing upward. She bore a hint of mischievousness in her smile, but her\neyes had such depth he found himself wondering what profound and\ninteresting things she was pondering.\n“People who think that we’re different,” Syl said, “don’t know you\neither. They look at you and see a perfect soldier.”\n“What do you see?”\n“Flaws,” she said. “Wonderful ones. I’ve never known perfection,\nKaladin, but I should think it boring if I did.”\n“I think you might be close.”\n“To being boring?” she said.\n“That’s … not what I meant.”\nShe grinned at him, but then leaned closer. “I’m not perfect, Kaladin. I\nthink our flaws are what make us the most similar. We’ve both spent far too\nmuch of our lives living for other people.”\n“Me for the bridgemen. And you … for me, right?”\nShe nodded.\n“That’s what happened in the tower,” he guessed. “You came to realize\nthat?”\n“I was trying too hard,” she said, “and learned some interesting lessons\nabout myself as a consequence.”\nHuh. Hearing that twisted his emotions into knots, but he knew it was\ntrue. Wit had demanded Kaladin explain who he was, now that he wasn’t\nleading Bridge Four anymore. What did Kaladin want that was for him?"

What did Kaladin want that was for him?\nThe same challenge could be given to Syl.\n“I suppose,” he said, “if you weren’t spending so much of your time\nbound to the demands of a finicky human, you might have a ton more time\nto sneak rats into people’s sock drawers.”\n“Please,” she said. “My pranks are so much more sophisticated. I’ve\nfound out how to trick skyeels into hiding in drawers.”\n“Storms, that’s horrifying.”\nShe smiled. “I want to stay with you, Kaladin, and learn a different way\nof helping. I want to be a scribe, but I need to do that without living for you,\nif that makes sense. I’m trying to figure out the difference.”\n“I want to protect people,” Kaladin said, “but … I can’t exist only to\nslavishly chase that one duty. Letting go of Tien’s death finally taught me\nthat truth. So how do I protect, but not live to protect?”\n“Exactly.”\n“I guess we’ll figure it out. Somehow? Assuming the world doesn’t end\non us in seven days.”\nThey nodded to one another, and as they left the house, Kaladin at last\nrealized what it reminded him of.\nHome.\nWhich was strange, since it was so different, but it felt the same.\nDifferent shapes. Similar souls.\nTogether, he and Syl approached Szeth, who had dug something out of\nthe dirt near a tree. He held it up, an oblong stone over a handspan long.\n“They put it back,” he said softly. “I thought they might.”\n“Is that the rock?” Kaladin asked. “From your story?”\n“Yes. Just a rock.” Szeth dropped it to the ground with a dull thump.\n“Another meaningless stone that somehow dominated my life. I am ready to\ncontinue to the monastery. I thought coming here would lay some spirits to\nrest, but they plague me still.”\n“Memories are like wine, Szeth,” Kaladin said. “They ferment. If you\nnever let them out, the pressure will simply keep building.”\nSzeth eyed him.\n“I grew up in a home much like that one,” Kaladin said, nodding to the\nside. “You had one sibling? A sister?”\n“Yes,” Szeth said.\n“Sometimes, on the battlefield,” Kaladin said, “I’d think how strange it\nwas that I’d ended up there. I was supposed to have become a surgeon. And\nyou a shepherd, right?”\n“Yes,” Szeth whispered.\n“Do you ever look back and feel intimidated by the flow of time?\nBemused how its current snatched you up and carried you away?”\nSzeth eyed Kaladin. “You’re trying to imply that we’re the same. You\nand me.”\n“I think we are, Szeth.”\n“No. I don’t think so.”\n“Why not?”\nPerhaps Szeth knew he was being baited, because he hesitated. But\nKaladin had tried cajoling and offering help. This was another method of\ngetting someone to talk: to assert something they found incorrect, and wait\nfor them to explain why.\n“Because,” Szeth said, turning to hike away from the homestead, boots"

It was\nforced upon me. I would have been happy as a dancer if not for\nstonewalkers like yourself. Raiders who sailed the ocean nearby.”\n“They attacked here?” Kaladin asked.\n“Yes,” Szeth said, “but that’s not what I resent most about them. Instead\nit is … what their raids did to us. To me.”\nKaladin frowned, keeping up. Syl walked along on the other side,\nchoosing to remain human size.\nThen, finally, Szeth continued. “That night, after I found the stone, the\nraiders came, but it’s not what you’re thinking. I didn’t meet one of them. I\nmet something else. Something worse …”\nTWENTY-SIX YEARS AGO\nEven long after the sun had gone down, Szeth felt that he was somehow in\nthe shadow of the white-cliffed mountains.\nThe bleating of lambs filled the air, emerging from the darkness around\nhim with a nervous energy. Like they sensed a predator. Dozens of shepherd\nfamilies crowded into this ravine, homes left behind, as they were too close\nto the coast and the ravaging stonewalker raiders.\nSzeth and his sister had to work hard to keep their flock—driven hastily\nthrough the oncoming dusk—from bleeding into the others. That might\nprove impossible, given how the shepherds kept pulling farther and farther\nback, up against the slope of the mountains. Nervously trying to be as far\nfrom the raiders as possible.\nUp here, you’d start finding stones in the soil—little pebbles that were\ntoo small to be worshipped, but big enough that you still shouldn’t touch\nthem, if it could be avoided. You never found ones that small below.\nPerhaps these pebbles were part of the mountain—a beautiful sign of the\nlove of the spren, who provided it as a protective fortification.\nSzeth and Elid eventually got the sheep into a huddle. The beasts\nwouldn’t sleep easily tonight though; they could sense their masters’\nconcern. He looked to the sky, and the clouds shrouding moon and stars.\nThe night felt oppressive. Clay lamps made points of light all through the\nvalley around him, but they almost seemed to be swimming in that\nblackness. Like they were the stars, and he was somehow floating above\nthem …\nHe left his sister and found his mother beside some improvised firepits,\ndiscussing an evening meal to hopefully calm everyone down. Misir wat, a\nthick paste made of red lentils, eaten with a spoon or fork off a wooden\nboard for a plate. It was the wrong day of the week for meat.\nMother put Szeth to work, which he realized was what he’d wanted in\nwandering this direction. He busied himself mashing vegetables with vigor.\nNo chopping—the Farmer owned several fine steel knives, crafted by an\nHonorbearer using their Soulcasting art, but none were available. So he\nused a clay mortar and pestle to crush the onions, garlic, and spices together\n—each of which had been lightly braised to soften them."

So he\nused a clay mortar and pestle to crush the onions, garlic, and spices together\n—each of which had been lightly braised to soften them.\nThey’d brought some small portable clay ovens, and had them heating\nup. The spiced lentils went into the clay dish on the top to simmer. Bread—\nor today, soda biscuits—went into the oven.\nIt was good active work. In the distant darkness, music started playing as\nsomeone got out their flute. This cut off shortly, leaving the nervous\nbleating. The Farmer wouldn’t want music to give away their position, in\ncase raiders slipped past his soldiers. That was why they had no bonfires,\nand minimal lanterns. Indeed, Szeth worked at his mashing only by the\nshadowy light of the firepit and the oven.\nSzeth enjoyed working on meals like this, even if the onions made his\neyes water. The Cook—who oversaw the feeding of the people and made\ncertain nobody ever went hungry—had created interesting wooden ladles\nfor measuring. The one Szeth used had the bowl of the ladle split into three\nsections, with some smaller measuring sections along the handle. All he had\nto do was fill the largest compartment with oil, the middle one with onion,\nand the next with garlic. Then he filled the three little divots on the handle\nwith salt, ground chili pepper, and coriander, respectively. He could dump\nthat all into his pestle and begin mashing, and would always have the\ncorrect proportions.\nOnce that was done, he added it to the clay cooking dish—with one\nscoop of lentils and two of water. The measuring ladle let him work without\nsupervision, and he enjoyed it specifically because it was impossible to do it\nwrong. Why couldn’t more things in life have a tool like this for exact\nmeasuring?\nHe hadn’t forgotten the choice his family had made in moving the stone,\nthough fretting over it brought him little satisfaction. He finished the entire\nserving bowl of misir wat, left it simmering, and moved to another—though\nthe Cook herself soon strode past and checked on his work. The girthy\nwoman was dressed all in color, with a red skirt, blue sash, and yellow\nblouse. Dark, curly hair up in twin buns on her head, skirt parted at the front\nto show off another splash of yellow underneath. She was one of those who\nadded, a ruling peer of the Farmer.\n“Needs more pepper,” she declared of his misir wat.\nWhat? No, he’d done it perfectly. Szeth watched with horror as she\nadded chili, then bustled off. Why … why would she say that? She’d\ncreated the measuring tool herself. The soup should taste right. Unless …\nHe must have done something wrong. Why did he do things wrong even\nif he had a tool?\nSoon another vibrantly dressed figure stepped up to his fire. The Farmer\nwore his robes over his traditional farming clothing, which would be soiled\nfrom the day’s work. The dirty clothing was a symbol, but so were the\ncolors, in this case a violet outer robe and an inner sky-blue one of filmier\nmaterial. No mere splash of color for the Farmer. He was color.\nHe had pale skin, like Szeth’s family. Not uncommon in this region,"

Not uncommon in this region,\nthough those with darker skin were more prevalent. “Ah,” he said, seeing\nSzeth. “Son-Neturo. I had hoped to find your father at the fire.”\n“I’ll find him, colors-nimi,” Szeth’s mother said from nearby, where\nshe’d been distributing plates and biscuits.\nThe Farmer bowed his head and spread his hands, indicating he’d accept\nher offer of service. Then he accepted a plate of food from the Cook as she\nbustled back in their direction. The plate had little piles of food across it and\na single biscuit, stuck in place with some lentil paste. Szeth guessed the\nFarmer would have preferred to refuse the meal, as others were still unfed,\nbut one did not contradict the Cook when she delivered food.\nThe Farmer settled down—robes rustling—on a log near Szeth, who\ncontinued working on the next large bowl of misir wat. The man’s presence\nmade Szeth uncomfortable. Was Szeth supposed to say something?\nEntertain him? Szeth began sweating, despite the cool night air.\n“I have heard about you from your father, son-Neturo,” the Farmer said.\n“Perhaps you could come and dance for my farmers and me in the fields.”\n“I … I don’t know, colors-nimi,” Szeth said, blushing. “Entertaining the\nfarmers is usually a job for musicians, isn’t it?”\n“It is a job for any who wish it,” the Farmer said.\n“Does it … add, though?” Szeth asked. “Dancing doesn’t make anything\nor feed anyone.”\n“Ah, you are young yet,” he said, “if you think that to sweeten a person’s\nlife is not a form of feeding them.” He smiled. The man had a kindly face,\noval, like a grain of wheat topped by flaxen hair. His hands were callused,\nwith dirt under the nails, a true sign of nobility.\n“Colors-nimi?” Szeth found himself asking. “How … do you know what\nto do?”\n“I’m not sure I follow you, child.”\n“The right choices. How do you know what they are?”\nThe Farmer sat for a time, stirring his food, taking a bite now and then.\n“Do you know the difference between men and animals, son-Neturo?”\nSzeth frowned. It seemed a question with a great number of possible\nanswers, but he didn’t want to give the wrong one.\n“Men,” the Farmer said, “can take actions.”\n“Animals … take actions, colors-nimi.”\n“It may appear that they do, yes. But if you consider, you will realize\nthey do not. Does the rain act when it falls? Does the rock act when it rolls\ndown the hill? No, the spren move these things.”\nWas the Farmer testing him? Because his own experience taught him\notherwise.\n“I have a sheep,” Szeth said. “Molli. She always comes close to me\nwhen I’m sad, and she licks my face. She chooses, colors-nimi.”\n“Does she now?” the Farmer said, sounding amused. “I think not.\nThough I suppose it is wisdom, after a fashion, to think your own thoughts,\nson-Neturo.”"

I\ndon’t. That is the simple answer. I try. I see. I act. The spren move most\nthings in the world, child, but they do not move people. There’s a reason for\nthat, one that the Stone Shamans teach, and one I ponder as I work.”\n“So … I learn what to do …”\n“By trying,” the Farmer said.\n“That’s not specific enough,” Szeth said, smashing onions and spices\ninto his wooden pestle. “Two people can try, and come up with different\nanswers. Surely the spren have the truth for us. Surely they will tell us what\nto do.”\n“If they did,” the Farmer said, “would that not be the same as moving\nus? Making of us rain, or rocks, or … other things that do not move on their\nown.”\nHe was about to say sheep, Szeth thought.\nThe Farmer finished the last of his mash, then glanced up toward the sky.\n“In other lands, rulers don’t act,” he said calmly. “They decide, but don’t\nact. That is why I must go each day and bring life from the earth, son-\nNeturo. Why I must add, rather than subtract.”\nThat made sense, but Szeth found that his conversation had yielded\nfewer answers than he’d wished. If the Farmer didn’t automatically know\nthe right thing to do, then what hope did Szeth have?\nPerhaps I can find the spren, he thought. And ask them. They lived\ninside everything, especially stones, but were coy. Szeth had seen only three\nspren in his life, and each glimpse had been fleeting.\nSzeth’s father arrived at the dim fireside.\n“Check your measuring tool,” the Farmer said to Szeth. “You’ve been\nadding too much pepper.” He walked over and joined Szeth’s father,\nspeaking to him softly while washing his plate at the cleaning trough.\nSzeth finished mixing his current bowl, then got a plate for himself and\none for his sister. He hiked off through the darkness, up to the armpit of the\nvalley, where Elid was sitting on the grass looking pensive, her small\nceramic lamp in her lap.\n“Szeth,” she whispered, “we’re missing three sheep.”\n“We’ll find them in the morning,” he said, handing her a plate. “Probably\njoined another flock.”\nShe nodded, and in the flickering light glanced at him, then at the food,\nthen away. Nervous.\n“What?” he demanded.\n“Molli is one of the missing sheep,” she said. “I know how you favor\nher, Szeth. It’s all right though. I’m sure she’s simply with one of the other\nflocks like you said.”\nHe frowned. Molli did not like other sheep. She was almost blind, yes,\nbut she could smell them. “You’re sure?”\n“I’m sure. Do you remember bringing her?”\n“I gathered her with the rest before we struck out,” he said. “But there"

Do you remember bringing her?”\n“I gathered her with the rest before we struck out,” he said. “But there\nwas so much chaos …” He met his sister’s eyes, then turned to the\nsouthwest, toward the ocean and their home. A red haze stained the air. The\nstonewalker raiders liked to attack at night. Their metal lanterns were more\neffective than ceramic ones, and their arrows could set the roofs of fishing\nvillages ablaze.\nThe Farmer brought our soldiers, he thought. They’ll be defending the\ncoastlands. It was unlikely any stonewalkers would strike as far inward as\nSzeth’s family homestead.\n“I’ll just … go check some of the nearby flocks,” he said. “She’s easy to\nspot.”\nHe lit himself a lamp and sheltered it with his hand, then went searching.\nBut as he worked, calling to nearby shepherds, a feeling of dread built\nwithin him. Molli always made her way home. She was the one he didn’t\nneed to worry about when the flock strayed.\nAnd so, after searching five other flocks, Szeth found his eyes drawn\nsouthwest again. Toward that blazing horizon. Perhaps it was his\nconversation with the Farmer, emphasizing that the defining feature of\nhumans was their ability to choose. Perhaps it was the way his family had\ndug out the rock. Perhaps it was the general tone of the day, whispering that\nthere were no correct answers. Only decisions.\nIn that moment, Szeth made a choice. A wholly uncharacteristic one that\nhe likely would not have made on any other night. He put out his lamp,\ntrusting the filtered violet moonlight breaking through the clouds, then went\nstalking into the night. Toward their homestead. To find Molli.\nBy himself.\nThe impending events in Iri are another sign. The age of\ntransitions has arrived.\nColot joined Adolin as he left Gallant and jogged toward where the emperor\nwas finally emerging from his palanquin. As one, the sea of Azish soldiers\nand attendants bowed, and storms, Adolin wasn’t certain he’d seen so many\nawespren in one place—exploding like rings of blue smoke, almost in\nconcert with the bows. As if the very spren showed deference to the\nemperor.\nAdolin nudged Colot, and the two of them bowed too. His soldiers\nbehind them, taking the cue, did as well.\n“We bow to a foreign monarch?” Colot whispered.\n“By coming here, we put ourselves in his command structure. Let’s show\nthe man some respect.”\nPer tradition, they bowed for ten seconds, until Noura—head vizier—\nclapped once. The formality of it itched against Adolin’s Alethi sensibilities.\nNot that they didn’t have their own moments of propriety—theirs simply\nmade much more sense.\nAs Adolin straightened, Yanagawn walked down a little ramp—wearing\na crimson and gold robe that seemed at least ten layers thick and a hat wider\nthan his shoulders—and spread his hands out to welcome Adolin. “Thank\nyou,” he said in Alethi, taking Adolin’s hand—prompting gasps across the\nfield.\n“I’m always good for a fight, Your Excellency.”"

He waved to the side, gesturing for\nCommandant Kushkam to approach.\nThe man did so, with another bow. Noura—who often spoke for\nYanagawn at meetings—also stepped up to join them; she was an older\nwoman with her hair in a grey braid, topped by a cap with an intricate red\nand yellow pattern.\n“Adolin, you’ve seen our defenses?” Yanagawn said. “What do you\nthink?”\n“They’re solid,” Adolin replied. “The enemy can bring forces in only a\nlittle at a time, as the way Oathgates work requires that transfers from\nShadesmar use only the very center of the platform. I—”\n“Yes,” Kushkam said in Alethi, stepping forward and pointedly\naddressing Adolin, not the emperor, “our defenses are solid. As soon as\nyour men are off the platform, my troops will surround the control building.\nNot only that, but we’ll have one of the royal Soulcasters ready to help.”\nSoulcasters. Right. “Can you transform all the air inside the control\nbuilding to bronze?” Adolin asked.\n“Regrettably,” Noura said, “our Soulcasters aren’t capable of such feats.\nWe can transform many objects to bronze, but the air itself? No, alas.”\nAdolin nodded. But as he thought about it, he wasn’t certain it would be\nuseful. Alethi Soulcasters were limited to making specific shapes, and\nfilling a room might have been impossible for them as well. Worse, it\nwouldn’t actually do much. The enemy could just transfer the metal into\nShadesmar and tow it out of the way.\n“We’re going to fill the building with as much water as we can,”\nKushkam said, “then Soulcast that into bronze. We will pack soldiers in\nclose around the outside so if the enemy does get through, we can kill them\nin droves. And even if they get past that, we’ll drop oil and cook them\nalive.”\n“No,” Adolin said, shaking his head. “Set that building ablaze only as a\nlast resort. And tell me, how often have your soldiers here faced combat?”\n“They are time-tested veterans,” Kushkam said. “From campaigns\nagainst Marat and in the Yezier succession crisis.”\n“I meant against singers,” Adolin said.\n“We’re the Imperial Guard,” Kushkam said. “We’ve had the honor of\nprotecting the emperor, and the city, this last year.”\n“So your soldiers have never faced a singer charge,” Adolin said,\nthoughtful. “I think we should try a different tactic. The Soulcasting isn’t\ngoing to work when they can merely transfer the bronze to the other side,\nand your soldiers are going to need archer support. We should fill the field\nwith debris: furniture, scrap metal, anything you can spare. Post soldiers\nbehind it in a wide ring, with pikes and barricades.”\n“What?” Kushkam said, then looked to Noura—addressing her instead"

        "text": "behind it in a wide ring, with pikes and barricades.”\n“What?” Kushkam said, then looked to Noura—addressing her instead\nof the emperor, and changing to their language. “Excellency, that’s\nnonsense! The enemy would immediately use any debris as cover. We have\na perfect killing field inside the dome! Why would we ruin it?”\nAdolin blinked in surprise as the words warped, seemed to shift, then\nentered his mind as if they’d been spoken clearly in Alethi. No, better. He\nunderstood the nuance of the inflections, as if he were a natural speaker of\nthe language. Storms. His father’s touch was more effective than he’d\nimagined.\n“We need to be careful,” Adolin said, drawing a few shockspren from the\nothers as he spoke in perfect Azish. “They’ll send Regals, maybe Fused\nfirst, and I don’t trust your lines against those. You need that archer support,\nso it’s better to have larger, fortified lines farther back. If your men break in\nthe initial assault, it could turn into a rout.”\n“I can’t believe I’m hearing this,” Kushkam said. “Throwing away the\nperfect advantage?”\n“This is a Stuko Stem,” Adolin said, gambling on language he thought\nKushkam would like. “Obstruction favors us.”\n“It’s plainly not a Stuko Stem. If anything, it’s a Haramed Stem. You\ninsult my troops!”\n“At least listen to me about the fires,” Adolin said. “Singers are more\nresistant to heat than we are. If you turn the place into an oven, they’ll\nrecover first—and we’ll lose the entire dome to them.”\nThe commandant hesitated, actually considering this. He ground his\nteeth, but didn’t object.\nSo he’s not a fool, Maya thought to Adolin. That’s good.\nAgreed, he thought back. He just didn’t live with a siege mentality on the\nShattered Plains for years.\nStill, the man did glare at him, then looked to the emperor. Adolin\nimmediately realized his mistake. He should never have voiced his\nobjections in the presence of the emperor, embarrassing the commandant in\nfront of his supreme authority. Adolin should have pulled the man aside and\nmade suggestions, not stood in public and contradicted him. Storms, what a\nrookie mistake. He could tell from Kushkam’s posture, standing tall, chin\nraised, that he took it as a threat to his command.\n“Excellency,” Adolin said to Yanagawn, “the commandant is obviously\npassionate and dedicated to the defense of this city. I pushed to see what he\nthought, but I went too far. I bow to his experience and wisdom; let us\nproceed as he suggests.”\nKushkam glanced at him, frowning.\n“Very well,” Yanagawn said, studying Adolin. “Noura, please convey to\nthe commandant that we trust his decisions.”\nShe did so. The thick-necked man bowed to the emperor, nodded to\nAdolin, and trotted off—an aide bringing his horse so he could swing into\nthe saddle and begin calling orders.\n“I would have done as you asked, if you’d pushed,” Yanagawn said\nsoftly to Adolin, in Alethi."

He led\nour forces in several important battles, as recently as two years ago.”\n“A field commander, promoted to defense of the city,” Adolin said, with\na nod. “I’d rather have him on my side. Undermining the fellow in charge is\nnot a way to make friends.”\n“Some would argue that in the positions we hold, we don’t need\nfriends,” Noura said.\n“I would argue you need them more,” Adolin said, then pointed. “Your\ntroops are disciplined and proud. If I undermine their commander, we’ll\nlose morale. If Kushkam is as good as you say, he’ll come around.” He gave\nthem a smile. “Just have some furniture and scrap ready for when we need\nit.”\n“Adolin,” the emperor said, his hands laced together. The clothing and\nheaddress were so regal it was sometimes easy to forget the young man\nwearing them—a teen much the same age Adolin had been when he began\nhis first bouts as a ranked duelist. “What was that you two said? Something\nabout stems?”\n“Oh! Those are shorthand expressions,” Adolin said, “for the opening\nmoves of an enemy player in towers. They say Kushkam is an expert.”\n“Towers?” the emperor asked.\nAdolin started. “Do you call it something else?” he asked, glancing at\nNoura.\n“No,” she said. “The Azish word is ‘gunna ma’—essentially, ‘the tower\ngame.’”\n“Never heard of it,” Yanagawn said.\n“Storms!” Adolin said. “A leader who doesn’t know towers? Noura,\nwhat have you been teaching him?”\n“Political history, social structures, languages, contracts …”\n“Useless on the battlefield,” Adolin said. “A field commander has to\nknow towers.”\n“Pardon, Brightlord,” Noura said, sounding amused. “His Excellency is\nnot a field commander.”\n“We’re on a field of battle now,” Adolin said, gesturing around them.\n“And he’s ultimately in charge.” He leaned in toward the emperor, close\nenough that one of the man’s bodyguards stepped forward until Yanagawn\nwaved him back.\n“Listen, Excellency,” Adolin said. “We’ll remedy this, after the war is\ndone. Noura can teach what to say in a meeting, but if you want to learn\nstrategy, I’ll start you on towers.”\n“I’d … like that,” Yanagawn said, smiling. “Thank you, Adolin. For all\nof it. For being here when you didn’t have to be. When this isn’t your\nfight.”\n“Have you heard about the fixed brawl, Excellency?”\n“That’s what they call the fight where you nearly lost your Shards,”\nYanagawn said. “Stormblessed saved you.”\n“I might not be here,” Adolin said, “if someone hadn’t stood up for me"

I promise it.”\nYanagawn bowed his head in thanks. Adolin bowed in return, and\nwithdrew. As he did so, Colot—who had been hovering nearby—rushed to\ncatch up. “I’m impressed,” he said softly.\n“Is it the cape?” Adolin asked, enjoying how it flowed behind him as he\nwalked. “It’s the cape, isn’t it?”\nColot grinned, the sunlight catching the dark red patches in his hair. “I\nknow a smattering of Azish. I didn’t know you were so good with the\nlanguage.”\n“I’m not,” Adolin said. “My father did something to allow me to speak it\n—I think Noura and the emperor realized that immediately. They’re used to\ndealing with him.” He nodded. “We’ll have to win over the commandant\nthough. I can’t fight effectively beside someone who doesn’t want me\nthere.”\n“Yeah,” Colot said as they crossed the cobbled square. “I hear you. I\ntried that myself …”\nAdolin winced, reminding himself how close Colot had gotten to full\nWindrunner before being rejected by the spren. After that, leaving entirely\nhad been less painful than continuing as a squire.\n“I’m sorry,” Adolin said. “I didn’t mean to dredge up painful\nexperiences.”\n“It’s fine,” Colot said. “Frankly, everything dredges them up.” He shook\nhis head and gazed toward the sky, where a group of windspren passed as\nribbons of blue light. “I don’t even know if it was something I did, Adolin.\nThat’s what really hurts. The honorspren evaluating us were ones who hated\nthe leadership at Lasting Integrity, and had left before you got there. They\npractically fawned over Kaladin and Bridge Four. Every spren wanted\nsomeone like him. Not someone like me.”\n“You mean lighteyed.”\nColot nodded. “It comes around, I guess. Centuries of treating the\ndarkeyes badly; when that turns on its head, it’s hard to complain. No one’s\ngoing to weep for me, the poor highborn boy who didn’t get what he\nwanted. I don’t imagine that they should.” He hesitated, drawing a few\npainspren crawling along at his feet. “Still feels like a punch to the gut.”\nAdolin patted him on the back. The Windrunners’ loss was Adolin’s\nadvantage. He could do far, far worse than a second with Colot’s training\nand discipline. And if he guessed right, the other hole in his command\nstructure would be filled by someone ahead of them. While the rank and file\nof Adolin’s volunteer force were being interrogated and situated by the\nAzish officers, a small group stood apart: a cluster of eight women in\nvibrant Alethi gowns.\nSince Shallan was off doing … well, he didn’t know what exactly.\nShallan stuff—probably involving the fate of reality itself.

And since he\nwouldn’t have his wife to scribe for him on this battlefield, he’d asked\nHighprince Aladar if he could spare some of his staff.\nAladar had taken that request to heart, and had sent his best: his\ndaughter, May.\nWell, this was going to be awkward.\n“Is that May Aladar?” Colot asked.\n“I asked for some scribes.”\n“Storms,” Colot said. “Adolin, didn’t you two …”\n“We never dated,” Adolin said. Then, with a wince, he corrected himself.\n“I never thought we were dating. She … um … understood differently.” He\ntook a deep breath and stepped up to the group of women. “May.”\nShe had black hair, chin-length in the front but shorter in the rear. A\nround button of a face, with light tan eyes. Features reminiscent of ancient\nstone sculptures by master artists.\n“Adolin,” she said, her voice cool. Also like stone. That wasn’t merely\nfor him—that was how May tended to be. “This is going to be a rough\ndefense. The Fused will rip through this fortification like it’s last year’s\ncloak left out in the sun.”\n“Reports say there aren’t many Fused,” Adolin said. “Though they’re\nbound to have stormform and direform Regals. We just have to keep them\ncontained for a few days until the forerunners of our southern army arrive.”\n“Even a few days is an eternity against enemies like these,” she said.\n“Regardless, I’m glad you spoke to my father. I was worried I would be\ntrapped in the tower with nothing relevant to do. Where would you like me\nto begin?”\n“Check out their triage and medical tents,” Adolin suggested. “Make\nsure we don’t need to send for any supplies before the Oathgate shuts\ndown?”\n“Excellent idea,” she said.\nSo cold, Maya thought. She’s not a good match for you. I’m surprised\nyou considered it.\nI considered a lot of women, Adolin thought back. There wasn’t a lot else\nto do on the Shattered Plains. I dated basically everyone eligible and at\nleast halfway interested.\nWait, wait, Maya thought, laughing—something that was so good to hear\nfrom her. Adolin. Were you a slut?\nHe about choked as she said it, but then smiled. She said it in the same\nexaggerated way some of his soldier friends did, good-naturedly laughing\nover one another’s failings.\nI, he thought to her, was not a slut. A trollop at worst. Besides, I find that\na wise commander investigates every strategy, so that he knows his options.\nOf course, she thought. You are correct. A wise soldier knows all the best\npositions.\nAdolin grinned. From speaking to Pattern and Syl, he’d gotten the\nimpression that spren were innocent in the ways of romance and intimacy.\nMaya was different. He supposed it was what happened when you spent\nyour life around soldiers.\nHis attention was drawn back to May as she pointed to one of her wards,\nthen at him.

The girl would stay close to Adolin, in case he needed a\nmessage read or written, as May herself looked over infrastructure. They\nprobably didn’t need to worry about the Azish in this regard, but it never\nhurt to check.\n“Father stopped by,” May added. “You should see him before he leaves.”\nThen she was off, leading her group of scribes toward their counterparts\nsetting up a pavilion nearby. The Azish group would be mixed genders, as\nthey did things oddly here, but May spoke their language fluently.\nReally, she was the best he could have hoped for as an aide-de-camp.\nShe had experience running the princedom for her father, and had an\nexacting and precise way to her. He just wished he didn’t feel like the\ntemperature dropped ten degrees every time she walked past.\n“You … dated her?” Colot asked softly.\nHim too? “I specifically said I didn’t.”\n“You contemplated it though?”\n“She’s an expert sport archer,” Adolin said. “I thought we might have\nsomething in common.”\nArchery wasn’t a feminine art—but most prestigious Alethi families\nmade an exception for it, as well as a little dagger play. Women went to war\nwith their husbands and brothers, and camps got attacked. Keeping your\nhand covered for propriety was one thing; leaving yourself defenseless to\nenemy raiders was another. It was considered unseemly for a woman to\nspend as many hours on archery as May did, but times had been changing\nthere even before Adolin’s father started reading.\nAdolin turned and sought out Highprince Aladar, a bald man who wore a\nmustache with a pointed beard below his bottom lip. Adolin was surprised\nat how fondly he thought of the man these days. Not so long ago, he’d\nregarded all of the other Alethi highprinces with a healthy measure of\ndisgust. One had died by Adolin’s own hand.\nOnly two original highprinces had survived with their power intact.\nSebarial, who was essentially Urithiru’s finance minister, and Aladar, who\nhad fallen into being Navani’s right-hand administrator. Two others—\nBethab and Hatham—had lesser, but respected, positions in the\ngovernment. One in Thaylen City, the other in the field with the forces that\nshould arrive at Azimir in a few days. Neither had the same power they’d\nonce wielded; the days of highprinces as independent monarchs in Alethkar\nhad passed.\nAladar’s position involved the day-to-day administration of Urithiru. It\nwasn’t glorious, but it was in the thick of things, and Aladar seemed to\nenjoy that. Adolin walked up offering a hand, and he took it, with a\nrespectful nod.\nBehind him, each company of Adolin’s troops was being informally\nattached to an Azish company. For now, it was best if their forces each had\nan Azish counterpart for things like mess hours and duty rotations.\n“It’s an honorable task you do here, Kholin,” Aladar said. “I think we all\nstood a little taller after you insisted on coming to Azimir personally to\nhelp.”"

Stormfather send that he wouldn’t need it, but if\na thunderclast joined the battle …\nWell, they’d deal with that if it happened.\n“You have a good force here,” Aladar said, pointing. “Three hundred\nformer Cobalt Guardsmen who took up the uniform again after hearing of\nyour need. Another seventeen hundred volunteers from Urithiru, including\nmany foreigners. I had each tested for competence, and while they’re a bit\nof a hodgepodge, all are decorated in battle.” The older man smiled. “I’m\nsurprised we found anyone capable who hadn’t already been recruited, but\nit seems the word of ‘Prince Adolin’s need’ squeezed some juice even from\nthe rind. They might be irregulars, but I think they’ll serve you well.” He\npaused. “No Shardbearers, I’m afraid. I sent Mintez to the Shattered Plains\nwith mine, per your father’s request.”\n“There’s one other Shardbearer among the Azish,” Adolin said. “They\nkept one back for the city’s Imperial Guard, when the rest were sent to\nbattlefields to the south.”\n“I don’t think they were sent,” Aladar said. “I think they were bought?\nRented by Azish generals? Their system baffles me.”\n“I’m sure it involves paperwork.”\nAladar nodded, then turned and offered Adolin his hand a second time.\nAdolin took it hesitantly.\n“I’m proud, Adolin,” Aladar said. “Of what your family has done for\nAlethkar. Of what we’ve created. If you’d been able to read my innermost\nthoughts three years ago about what I wanted, they would have been of\nseizing land from my neighbors, of making a play for the throne by getting\nyou betrothed to May. Of petty goals and small-minded aspirations. Instead\nwe’ve built something.” His eyes took on a wistful expression. “I never\nknew how satisfying it was to build.” He squeezed Adolin’s hand. “Help\nour allies, Adolin. Save this city. That’s what we are now.”\n“People who build,” Adolin said softly.\n“People whose lives mean something,” Aladar added. “Your mother\nwould be proud of you too.” He smiled, letting go. “And please keep an eye\non May. She’s been getting ideas ever since Jasnah started going into battle\ndirectly.”\n“She’s a fine archer, Aladar,” Adolin said. “Won the women’s division\nthree times, I hear.”\n“I used to find that embarrassing,” he said. “I asked her once if she could\nfind a way to use a bow with only one hand …” He leaned in and lowered\nhis voice. “I’ve been letting her practice with our Plate and Blade. She\nmight do something foolish.”\n“Aladar,” Adolin said, “I was never formally with May, but even I know\nshe’s never attracted a foolishness spren. I’m glad you sent her. I’ll see that"

I’ll see that\nshe stays safe—safe as any of us can be over these next seven days.” He\nnodded toward the dome. “You should go. This will be our last chance to\nuse the Oathgate.”\nAladar stepped away, then—though it wasn’t really appropriate, as they\nwere the same rank—he saluted Adolin. Adolin’s family had stumbled in\nbuilding what they had, and he himself had blood on his hands. But …\nthings were better than they had been. The whole kingdom was. So Adolin\nsaluted back.\nAladar rushed off at the call for the final transfer. Some Azish civilians\nwere leaving for Urithiru, but many more remained. They wouldn’t\nabandon their homeland. They knew that all too often, refugees who went to\nUrithiru ended up staying.\nMost Azish would take their chances here, so he’d be fighting to protect\na city with its heart still in it. With that in mind, Adolin went to find his\narmorers and his Plate. The battle would be upon them within the hour.\nTWENTY-SIX YEARS AGO\nSzeth found light near the homestead.\nNot at the house itself, which was dark and shaded as he passed it. Molli\nwould be near the water trough, over by the family’s stone. That was only a\nshort distance, in the direction of the light.\nHe nearly jumped to the heavens when he heard rustling from the\nhanging lines of beads that covered the home’s doorway. Simply the wind.\nTrembling, he crossed the meadow toward that ruddy light. Concern\nmounting, Szeth forced himself to creep past the tree, the bark chill and\nrough on his palms.\nStraight ahead was the stone—with the packed soil around it—bulging\nfrom the ground like a tumor. Three men sat on it.\nThey sat on the stone, a small fire in front of them, built on the packed\nearth. They’d cooked a meal, and unwelcome scents—burned and horrible\n—assaulted Szeth. Szeth had a terrible premonition that he didn’t want to\naccept, so he didn’t look too closely at that fire. Instead he studied the three\nmen. Soldiers, in leather armor with glistening metal studs. Helms of pure\nsteel. Sheathed swords at their sides. Fingers messy from eating, bits of\nfood in their beards.\nThey were Shin.\nHis people. Not strange raiders from across the mountains. They wore no\ncolor, of course—just black, grey, and brown—but their features were\nunmistakable. He’d seen outlanders before, and had remarked on their eyes,\ntheir dress, their features.\nSzeth relaxed. This was a patrol of the Farmer’s soldiers. Similar groups\nhad come through his family’s lands. He moved to continue searching for\nMolli, but snapped a twig when he did, causing the men to turn in his\ndirection.\nOne slid down the stone to the ground beside the fire and stood, right\nhand on his sword. “Who’s there?”\nFeeling embarrassed, Szeth walked into the light. When they saw him,\nthey immediately relaxed."

I’m a shepherd.” Szeth frowned as he got closer,\nnoticing dark liquid staining the ground near the fire—and empty bottles\nnear the men. “That’s my father’s wine.”\n“Had to check the house,” said a man lying on top of the stone, his voice\nslurred, “for invaders.” He lifted a bottle to his lips. His face flushed with\ndrink, he had a lazy expression, his helmet off beside him. He was bald, his\nhead shaved clean.\n“Why are you drinking?” Szeth demanded. “You’re on patrol. What if\nyou get ambushed? What if—”\n“Raiders didn’t expect resistance,” the standing man cut in. He had dark\neyes set too deep into his skull. “They pushed off almost as soon as we\nmarched in. There won’t be more fighting tonight, unless some slipped\nthrough. We were sent to search.”\n“Best you tipped us a little,” the slovenly one said, drinking more. “For\nprotecting your hide, little shepherd.”\nThe third man had a wispy beard. Younger than the other two. He\nhunched as he sat on the angled top of the stone, staring down, half-drunk\nbottle of wine in his hands. Father saved it for special occasions.\n“You hungry, boy?” said the man with the sunken eyes.\nSzeth shied back. “I … think you should leave.”\n“What? Don’t you appreciate our help?”\n“I …” Szeth stepped farther back and didn’t meet their eyes. “I think you\nshould go.”\nThe drunk man chuckled and picked at a piece of meat, and Szeth knew.\nHe knew. But he didn’t want to accept it.\n“It’s aggravating, you know,” Sunken Eyes said. “We give our lives to\nprotect you, but our only payment is glares. You think we don’t get tired of\nbeing told to move on?”\n“You are they who subtract,” Szeth whispered.\n“We’re the ones standing between you and that,” the man said, waving\ntoward the red light on the horizon. “They burned an entire village, you\nknow? Would have kept going if we hadn’t been called in.”\nSzeth turned away, trying not to hear the sounds of the drunk man\nsmacking his lips as he ate, cracking bones between his fingers. A\nnauseating sound, like a crawling thing from the soil might make when you\nturned over its log.\n“You want our protection,” Sunken Eyes said. “But you don’t want us\naround. Think on that, little splash-colored shepherd. Think about how you\ntreat the people who defend you.”\n“The world would be better without you,” Szeth hissed. “We’d all be\nblessed if there were no people who subtracted.”\nThe man snorted, then took a pull on his bottle of wine. He’d had more\nthan a little himself, it seemed, even if it didn’t show as much.\n“You know what I tire of most?” he said, glancing toward his friends."

If we were to just vanish, who would stop those\nmen on the coast?” He looked back, holding Szeth’s eyes. “You eat the meat\nwe slaughter, on your special days. You use the boards soldiers cut to build\nyour homes. Tell me: if you pay a man to kill, does that make you any less\nguilty? You subtract, little shepherd. You just do it the cowardly way.”\nSzeth hovered near the tree, angry. This man spoke with such\nconfidence. How dare he act as if he had answers? The Farmer didn’t have\nanswers. Father didn’t have answers. But this man thought he did? This …\npathetic excuse for a human being, this sack of slime that … that …\nSzeth sniffled and wiped tears from his eyes. Nearby, the quiet one\nhelped the slovenly one off the stone. They kicked a bottle aside and\nstumbled away into the night, heading past the house. Sunken Eyes stayed\nby the fire, his expression stubborn as he squatted and picked at the\nremnants of the meat. He ripped off a piece and began gnawing at the flesh.\nThat was Molli. Szeth finally accepted it. The “spilled wine” on the\nground was blood, and he’d known what the men were cooking the moment\nhe’d smelled the char. He fell to his knees in the dim light, finding her pelt\n—cut free—in the grass.\n“Why?” he asked hoarsely.\n“Sometimes,” Sunken Eyes said, stumbling to his feet, “we leave\nreminders to make it harder to ignore us. It’s worth the punishment. Worth\nthe anger and the shouts, just to … live for an evening. Like you do.” He\nstarted into the night, unsteady on his feet.\nSzeth pulled Molli’s wool to his face, but all he could smell was the\nblood.\n“No,” Sunken Eyes said in a ragged voice. “No, that’s enough …” He\nstumbled a little farther. “I said no.”\nSzeth barely registered the man’s erratic behavior—speaking to nobody.\nInstead Szeth felt a building rage. A blinding, terrible heat. He dropped the\npelt and went running, colliding with the soldier, making him stumble. But\nSzeth was only a child, and small for his age. He pounded at Sunken Eyes,\nbut the man merely pried him free and tossed him away—like feed for the\nchickens.\nSzeth hit the ground and tumbled against the roots of the tree. The man\ncontinued on. Stumbling, unsteady. “No,” he repeated. “No, I’ll get a\nwhipping for what we’ve already done. If I did that … it would be a\nhanging. He’s a child. No.”\nSzeth pushed himself up, his right hand on something cool and smooth.\nA coldness that spread through him, rage extinguished—replaced by a\ndistinct deep, terrible void that seemed to take all life, light, and warmth\nand suffocate it.\nHe stood up, clutching the stone his family had unearthed earlier.

This wasn’t the\nspren’s will; he was lying to himself. This had been his choice. Why hadn’t\nthe spren struck him down? Didn’t he deserve it? Didn’t he—\nA hand grabbed him by the throat.\nThe soldier, growling, lurched upward and shoved Szeth, dropping him\nto the ground on his back. The man straddled him, nails biting into the\nexposed skin of Szeth’s throat. Terrible breath, with the scent of death upon\nit, lips parted in a grin.

Thinking, numbly, that he had subtracted for the\nfirst time in his life.\nUntil a soft voice blossomed in his mind.\nHere now, what are you?\nSzeth started, glancing around.

She’d explained how to isolate his thoughts for privacy, but\nhe saw no reason to do so—and instead felt a little thrill. He knew that even\nsome Radiant bonds didn’t allow the two to read one another’s minds; it\nwas nice to have something that not all of them could do.\nHe stood on the cobbled ground before the large dome, getting a report\nfrom May Aladar as each piece of Shardplate was locked onto him.\nSabatons, then greaves, cuisses, culet and faulds, skirt …\n“I think we need a medical facility that’s closer,” May said. “I suggested\nthose buildings along the east side of the square.” She pursed her lips. “We\nwill have one healer to provide Regrowth.”\nSurprised, Adolin glanced at her as the armorers locked the breastplate\ninto place. “I didn’t think any Edgedancers could be spared.”\nShe stepped in closer and whispered, “My ward Rahel is a budding\nRadiant. She hasn’t wanted to tell people because it’s not Edgedancing, but\nthe other one.”\n“Truthwatcher,” he said.\n“Yes. She has quietly gone to Radiant Precilia for training, so she knows\nhow to heal. She’s never touched a weapon, and the prospect of fighting\nterrifies her, but she’s willing to help at the hospital.”\nHe nodded. “Give her my sincere thanks.” A single Radiant was an\namazing resource. Rahel could stabilize the most dire of the wounded—\nleaving the rest to surgeons—and that would save a great number of lives.\n“I will pass along your regards,” May said. “Brightness Navani wished\nto send you an Edgedancer, so I suggested this. Rahel is skilled, and it will\ngive her experience on an actual battlefield. Regardless, there is a secondary\nreason to use that first line of buildings to the east as a hospital.”\n“Which is?”\n“Saferoom underneath,” May explained. “It used to be a smuggler’s\ncellar, and I was informed that it will be an emergency bolt-hole to hide the\nemperor. Having a hospital there will disguise why he might run for that\nspecific building.”\nAdolin nodded again, making a mental note to learn how to find and use\nthe saferoom. He might need to stash his scribes there, if the dome fell. As\nhe considered, he saw some distinctive figures approaching. Friends from\nearlier days.\nAdolin grinned, tearing himself away from the armorers—who were\nworking on his pauldrons—to meet the newcomers, slapping shoulders very\ncarefully. “Gerenor, Isalor, Kappak. Storms, it’s good to see you. Thank\nyou.”\nKappak—a man with short hair that had a tendency to stick up—\nlaughed. “Adolin, you think I’d ship back to the Shattered Plains? We spent\nfive years there! I’m bored of it.”\n“Better to be wherever the Kholin is,” Gerenor said, with a wink. “That’s\nwhere the fun happens.”\n“Let’s hope not too much fun,” Adolin said. “Thank you for\nvolunteering.

Watch for messages\nand accept Colot’s word as my own, but if you feel you need to move—then\nmove. I trust you.”\nInstead of salutes, he got slaps on the back. The three broke off, each\ntaking command of a block of over six hundred. Adolin jogged to the\narmorers, metal sparking on cobbles as he went. “Sorry, Geb,” he said to the\ncurrent head armorer.\n“Oh, we know there’s no containing you, Adolin,” the darkeyed man said\nwith a laugh. “Just try not to go into battle without your gauntlets on!”\nColot smiled as Adolin’s pauldrons locked into place on his shoulders.\n“What?” Adolin asked.\n“Simply remembering what it’s like to serve with you, Brightlord.”\n“Military discipline,” May said, holding her ledgers under one arm, “is a\ndifferent beast entirely when Adolin Kholin is around.”\n“You like it,” Adolin said, shoving one hand into a gauntlet, then\ngrinning as he made a fist. Storms, that felt good.\n“I do?” May asked.\n“Gives you something to complain about.”\n“I do not complain,” she said. “I make reports on the principles of\nefficiency and command structures.” She paused. “You realize your\nmethods shouldn’t work, right?”\n“Which part of my methods?” he asked, shoving his fist into the left\ngauntlet.\n“Everyone—from the officers down to the spearmen—calls you by\nname. You fraternize with every rank, even going out to drink with your\narmorers.”\n“Geb knows the best places!” Adolin said.\n“It’s a gift,” Geb added.\n“It shouldn’t work,” May repeated.\n“But it does.”\nAdolin took his helmet from Dal—Geb’s assistant and son—with a nod\nof thanks. He turned back to May. “The men know I’m a mediocre officer,”\nhe said, tucking the helmet under his arm. “But they also know I’m a\nstorming good fighter. So it balances out. You should get your bow.”\nMay started. “What, really?”\n“Unless it violates principles of efficiency and command structures.\nColot, I assume we’re short on good archers?”\n“Afraid so,” Colot said. “We have some among the volunteers, as well as\na few of my former colleagues, but most of this lot are heavy infantry.\nArmored like bricks, trained for city fighting or supporting a Shardbearer.”\n“Well, gather our twenty best archers, then put them under May’s\ncommand.”\n“Command?” May whispered.\n“Unless you’d rather not,” he said. “But your father has named you his\nheir, and if you become highprincess, you’re going to need battlefield\nexperience. Let’s give it a chance. Assuming you have something\nappropriate to wear for battle.”\nAll talk of efficiency went out the window as May threw her ledger to\nher eldest ward and dashed off in a flurry of motion. Adolin grinned, then\nwaved Colot over.\n“I saw Beamlin Dorset in the block,” he said softly. “If Beam is here,"

They’ll\nbe comfortable taking orders from a woman, so make Beam May’s second,\nwith Talig as head sergeant. Put them on the interior balcony with the Azish\narchers; I’ll signal when I need them.”\n“It’ll be done, Adolin,” Colot said.\n“Great, thanks,” Adolin said, then turned to the head ward. She had curls\nof light brown in her hair, bespeaking some foreign heritage. “It was\nKaminah, wasn’t it?”\nShe nodded, and seemed surprised he remembered her name.\n“Ever been an aide-de-camp before?”\n“No, Brightlord.”\n“You’ll figure it out,” he said. “Battlefield promotion.”\n“I … Brightlord, are you sure?”\n“If May trained you, Kaminah, you’ll do fantastically.” She brightened at\nthe words. He pointed toward the dome. “You think you can figure out if\nthe archers’ balcony inside will hold a Shardbearer’s weight?”\n“I’m sure we can get an answer!” she said. “Gitora’s training as an\nengineer. I’ll send her.”\n“Excellent,” Adolin said. “While she works on that, you write down\norders to Colot and my battalionlords.” He gave her a moment to send\nGitora, then she came back and scrambled to get out her ledger. She knelt\nand put it on her lap to write.\n“We’re going to let the Azish do their thing,” he said, eyeing the ranks of\nglistening soldiers. “Tell my battalion- and companylords not—and I mean\nthat quite fervently—to undermine Azish authority, but also tell them to\nkeep watch. I want three companies from each battalion stationed out here,\nready to move in at a moment’s notice and form a classic pike wall, with\nspear and shield in the front rank. Just two deep for now.\n“Station them equidistantly around the outside, and have them wait on\nmy word to rush in and form up. Gallant should stay with his grooms, but\nget me a type three Shardbearer support squad with orders to protect my\nrear if I go in. As always, if I fall, retrieving the Plate and Blade are of\nprimary importance. Got that?”\n“Got it, Brightlord!”\n“Good,” Adolin said. “Let’s get to work. Those singers will arrive at any\nmoment.”\nThey’re here, Maya said, her voice only faintly labored. I’m watching\nthem on the other side. The Oathgate spren have become fully corrupted,\nand serve them now.\nHuh. She could see into both realms? That might be handy.\nMight be, she agreed. Awareness … is good, Adolin. I feel … better and\nbetter. I will say: it’s a pleasure watching you work. Feels so familiar.\n“Work,” he said, pulling on his helmet. “I haven’t started working yet.”\nLiar. You’ve already done the most important parts."

He took a deep breath, accustoming himself\nto wearing the helmet. It felt less stuffy than he remembered, and he felt\nenergized to be suited up again. Each movement quicker, his grip like a vise\nand his bearing like a fortress.\n“Miss me?” he whispered to the armor.\nActually, they did, Maya says. They hate waiting.\nAdolin smiled. “Maya, if you don’t mind, tell me whatever you can see\nabout the enemy movements.”\nAdolin, she said, there are … a great number of them. I know we had\nreports … but it’s daunting.\n“Any way you can get a count of Fused and Regals? The scouts couldn’t\ntell for certain.”\nI’ll try.\nWhen spren like Syl or Pattern were bonded, it pulled them into the\nPhysical Realm completely. Maya was different, and their bond different.\nWhich offered advantages—though he worried maybe he was stretching to\nfind ways to soothe his ego. Because he knew, as he’d acknowledged many\ntimes, that this was the era of Radiants.\nThe Shardbearer was no longer the pinnacle of the battlefield. The young\nlighteyed man who could outduel almost anyone was no longer nearly as\nvaluable as he’d once been—not when compared to someone who could\nliterally fly or bend stone to their will. In less than two years, Adolin Kholin\nhad become so much smaller than he’d once been.\nDespite that, he didn’t chase Radiance. It wasn’t only because his father\nand aunt expected him to become Radiant … or so he told himself. He\nwasn’t that petty, was he?\nStorms, he thought, marching with his small retinue of scribes and\nbodyguards to the steps up the outside of the dome. There he waited a\nmoment. Storms, I just want to choose for myself. Without my father’s\nguidance, or his name, or his decisions for once. Is that so wrong?\nYou all right? Maya whispered.\nI’m fine. He took another deep breath through the helm’s air slits. I’m\nfine. I can do this without him. My way.\nYeah, I don’t like that line of thought, Maya said to him. Kid, have you\ngot issues. So maybe take it from someone else with issues. It’s fine to need\nhelp. I needed it from you. Still might.\nGitora—the younger scribe training as an engineer—came hurrying\ndown the steps. She wore battlefield clothing. Not a havah, but silken\ntrousers underneath a long, colorful tunic slit up the sides. “It will hold your\nweight, Brightlord,” she said, with a bow.\n“Excellent,” he said. “You really do have an eye for engineering.”\n“Um …” The girl, maybe fifteen, shifted from one foot to the other. “In\nfact, the Azish Shardbearer is already up there stomping around.

Though I did check that the balcony\ncould hold you both, and the Azish here agree it will.”\nAdolin grinned, waving for his group to follow as they marched up the\nwooden steps. At the top was a door to the inner balcony, which ran in a\nlong wide loop around the dome. Slots let in light above, not backlighting\nthe archers. Officers also gathered here, watching the dim, flat stone plateau\nbelow. The sole feature was the small control building at the center, which\ncould hold perhaps thirty people.\nAll right, Maya said, I count maybe a hundred or so stormforms moving\ninto position. About as many direforms. That might be the extent of their\nRegals.\nThere wasn’t a real equivalent to Regals in the human armies. They were\nless dangerous than the Fused, but possessed forms of power that made\nthem fearsome fighters. Stormforms, for example, could release bursts of\nlightning—like the one that had killed a dear friend on the Shattered Plains.\nA lack he felt every time he went riding.\nAre the Heavenly Ones still there? he asked Maya. Or did they fly off\nonce the forces arrived?\nStill there, Maya said. The Fused have controlled the nearby beads,\nturning them into solid ground. They’ve got a lot of Voidlight. I am\nswimming in the beads off to the side, watching. Looks like … they’re\nbreaking some boats?\nTo make shields maybe, Adolin said. In a normal siege, you’d break\ndown buildings in nearby villages for wood.\nHe stepped up to the railing, taking off his helm and putting it under his\narm as Kaminah provided a spyglass for him. He used it to get a close-up\nview of what Kushkam’s soldiers were doing. The Azish military had done\nas Colot and Maya had initially suggested: gathering in a tight formation\nright around the central building. A thousand men, though the smallest ring\nat the center held only thirty or so, with some crossbowmen ready to release\nbolts into the building as soon as the enemy appeared. Anticipationspren\nwaved around them, like red streamers moving in wind.\nThey had quickly placed some wooden slats against the bottom half of\nthe doorways to the control building, which they were filling with water. It\nleaked, but there were enough buckets among the men to fill the thing—and\na Soulcaster in an exceptionally ornate outfit stood nearby, face masked to\nhide their ailment, ready to Soulcast the water into bronze and maybe\nprovide an obstruction to the enemy.\nAdolin quickly relayed what Maya had found about numbers of Regals\nto his scribes, and a messenger girl passed it to Kushkam’s officers. Adolin\nsincerely hoped that he was wrong—that Kushkam and his forces could\nhold. He’d soon know, though for now he had to wait.\nHe hated this part.\nHis father spoke of the excitement before a battle, the anticipation.\nAdolin understood some of that. He’d felt the same thing many times on the\nShattered Plains … but it had changed for him a while back. Maybe it was a\nyear at war, maybe it was the capture of the Thrill. But he swore it had\nstarted long before—perhaps as far back as when he and his father had been\nbetrayed by Sadeas, and left alone to die."

He liked showing his\nskill, he liked wearing the Plate, but he’d begun to be nauseated by the\nbutchery. It … it was silly, but he felt that the battlefield made a mockery of\nhis dueling skills. He’d trained with the sword to better his life and test\nhimself against others. Not to kill.\nFortunately for the army, this sense didn’t detract from his efficiency. He\ndid, and would, slaughter—so he didn’t have a high horse to sit on.\nHopefully his only horse was enjoying some grain and not tormenting his\ngrooms.\nAdolin, Maya said, something is happening.\nFirst wave? he asked.\nKind of. Look.\nLight flashed in a small ring around the command building. The Soulcast\nbronze vanished to the other realm, as Adolin had anticipated, where it\ncould be shoved aside. Spren burst from the building, soaring through the\nair on ribbons of red light. A ripple of discomfort and nervous mutters ran\nthrough the Azish archers around him, but Adolin recognized this from\nother battlefields.\n“They’re using Voidspren as scouts,” he said. “Kaminah, send a message\nto the commandant. The enemy will know exactly what terrain is waiting\nfor them, and precisely where we’re positioned. Tell him that I suggest the\nAzish should pull back and form a wider ring with more troops.”\n“Yes, Brightlord!” the scribe said, settling down with her spanreed to\nsend word to the Azish scribe center—while also dispatching one of the\nother young women as a runner.\nOnly two minutes later some of the Voidspren returned to the control\nbuilding and it flashed again—they were reporting back. No troops\ntransferred in at the same moment, but the Soulcast bronze did not reappear.\nThe enemy had removed it even more quickly than Adolin had expected.\nThe next part took a little time. Time for May to arrive in a uniform with\nthe archery platoon he’d requested. Time for Adolin to mentally prepare\nhimself to become a killer once more. Time for him to note Kushkam\nignoring his suggestion, forces remaining in tight ranks around the control\nbuilding.\nThose Voidspren continued to hover around. Maybe someday Aunt\nNavani’s anti-Light would be a viable way to engage with enemy spren—\nbut for now he ignored them. Chopping one in half with a Shardblade\nwould send it to Shadesmar to recuperate, but there were dozens here, so\nthat wouldn’t matter. He waited. Sweating. Feeling a strange, light\nventilation blow through his armor, keeping him cool. Then it happened.\nA third flash of light around the command building.\nIt began.\nThe Heralds are essentially no more. They are rejected by their\nBlades.\nTalmut’s monastery sat atop a long ridge upon the mountainside, high\nenough to give a perspective over the rest of the Nirovah Valley. The first\ntime Szeth had climbed this ridge—trudging up the switchbacks to the\nfortified encampment where the soldiers trained—it had taken over an hour.\nToday, he and Kaladin landed there after a quick Lashing into the sky."

The ridge was\nlonger than it was wide, with a cliff at its back. There was space here for\ndozens of buildings—mostly barracks and training halls.\nThe monastery itself was farther to the left, following a narrow path. For\nnow, Szeth inspected the military camp that had been his home.\n“Szeth?” Kaladin said. “It looks abandoned.”\nAlthough the buildings were in better repair than his homestead, no one\nwas out along the paths. It was as if all the people in his entire homeland\nhad just vanished.\n“There should be thousands of soldiers here training,” Szeth said.\n“Perhaps they moved north,” Kaladin said. “Where our Windrunners\nencountered resistance when trying to survey the land. Why does this place\nhave so much rock—I thought none of you could walk on it?”\n“This is the domain of soldiers,” Szeth explained. “Those who subtract\nare allowed to walk on stone, because their lives are blasphemy. They kill.”\nHe hesitated. “The ones I spoke of, who killed the sheep at my homestead?\nThey came from here.”\n“How can your society function?” Kaladin asked, glancing to Syl\nstanding beside him. “If you treat soldiers like that …”\n“The greatest task in life is to create, to add,” Szeth said. “The greatest\nshame is to break what someone else created—or to ruin art of the gods: the\nspren, and their kings, the Heralds. The stone upholds the soil and creates\nfoundations for Roshar. The spren created it.”\nHe glanced toward Syl, who seemed to find this amusing. “Yes,” she\nsaid, “we barf it out, you see. Rocks, pebbles, shale if we’re particularly\nnauseated.”\n“Not all of our lore … matches what I have seen on the outside,” Szeth\nsaid. “But Roshar is a creation of the gods. Honor, Cultivation, and\nOdium.”\n“Kind of,” Syl said. “Best we can figure out, Roshar is the work of the\nancient god who became Cultivation and Honor. Odium too, though that’s\nembarrassing to admit. It means we’re relatives, you see.”\n“Without the act of God,” Szeth said, “Roshar would weather away into\ndust and vanish into the ocean. To prevent this, the highstorms were created\nto rain crem.” He pointed. “The last crem of a dying highstorm is dumped\nonto these mountains, keeping them high, sheltering Shinovar. We thrive\nbecause of an act of God. So we revere the stone.”\n“Unless you’re a soldier,” Kaladin said, surveying the empty\nencampment with his hands on his hips, apparently finding this entire idea\nunpleasant. Which was good, since it was.\n“A soldier must still revere the stone,” Szeth said softly. “Many learn the"

Which was good, since it was.\n“A soldier must still revere the stone,” Szeth said softly. “Many learn the\nwrong lesson. It is not that stone is mundane to one who kills, it is only that\nsoldiers—living a life of destruction—are forced to defile it. Increasing\ntheir sin with each new weapon forged.”\n“Storms, this place is so bizarre,” Kaladin whispered.\n“We live lives of peace,” Szeth said, “compared to the near-constant\nwarfare of your lands.”\n“Because you shove all the unpleasant elements off on a few, whom you\ntorment.”\n“Is that not what the Radiants are?” Szeth said. “Watchers at the rim, as\nDalinar says? A pleasant term for an unpleasant idea—people who must kill\nso ordinary men and women can live peaceful lives. Radiants must bathe in\nblood and tarnish their souls in order to forge peace.”\n“That is,” Kaladin said, “a complete misinterpretation.”\nSzeth dropped the point. Why argue with one who was accustomed to\nalways being right? “Come. I think there are people here somewhere. The\nbuildings are in much better shape than the ones we passed below.”\nHe turned and looked over the landscape. Homesteads like his dotted the\ngreenery, and he could make out several small towns. They’d visited one on\nthe way here—and it had been abandoned. Perhaps Kaladin was correct and\nthey’d moved north, finding their way to one of the cities.\nKaladin and Syl didn’t object as Szeth led them to one of the barracks, a\nplace he remembered, though not fondly. He stopped—then, without going\nin, he waved for Kaladin and Syl to follow him and he strolled past to the\nnext building in line.\nAs he’d hoped, this prompted sounds from within the barracks—people\nrushing up to the windows to peek now that he was leaving. He spun and\ndashed back in a smooth motion, then kicked the door open, breaking the\nlock.\nDozens of people inside scattered into the shadows. Wide-eyed, dusty-\nfaced, wearing ragged clothing. He saw hints of splashes. Faded scarves.\nSashes that he could barely separate from trousers in the grime and dim\nlight.\nA piece of him let out a deep sigh. Seeing his kind again … made him\nfeel that he had finally awakened from a nightmare to something familiar.\nYet something was wrong. They kept away from him, and from the light\nspilling in through the now-open door.\n“What’s wrong with them?” Syl asked, peeking around him.\n“You,” Szeth said in his own language—it felt unfamiliar to him now,\nheavy on his tongue. “What is wrong with you? You are not soldiers, yet\nyou walk on stone?”\n“We must,” someone whispered from the shadows. “The soil will\nswallow us.”\n“Swallow us,” several others whispered.\n“Nonsense,” Szeth said. “How do you eat?”\n“We work fields at night,” another voice said. “As commanded by the\nshaman. When the ground cannot see us.”\n“See us …” others whispered.\n“What are they saying?” Kaladin asked.\n“They say the ground will swallow them, for some reason,” Syl"

When the ground cannot see us.”\n“See us …” others whispered.\n“What are they saying?” Kaladin asked.\n“They say the ground will swallow them, for some reason,” Syl\nexplained. “So they work the fields at night, and apparently hide here\nduring the day.”\n“Soldiers,” Szeth said, with Syl translating for Kaladin. “Where are the\nsoldiers?”\nThey retreated farther into the darkness, and several hissed when Szeth\nstepped forward. He summoned his Blade, which quieted them.\n“Soldiers went north,” one of them said from the shadows. “Hearing a\nvoice we could not …”\n“A voice?” Kaladin said. “Was it the voice of the Wind?”\n“No,” Szeth said, looking over his shoulder at Kaladin. “It must be the\nvoice of one of the Unmade.”\n“Szeth,” Syl whispered, “when we were in Kholinar, we ran into a\nstrange cult worshipping an Unmade. There were strange events in the\ntower too, when we first arrived. The effect of another Unmade.”\n“If there is one in Shinovar,” Kaladin said, “we need to find it and defeat\nit. Maybe that’s what Ishar is expecting of you, and why he said I needed to\nhelp you.”\n“Perhaps,” Szeth replied. “Or perhaps this punishment is what my people\ndeserve.” He turned from the building and stepped back out into the light.\n“They have invited in one of the Unmade, then refused to expel it when I\nwarned them.”\n“We’re here to change that,” Kaladin said, joining him. “Aren’t we?\nYou’ve been sent to cleanse the place.”\n“I haven’t decided what that cleansing will entail,” Szeth said. “Perhaps\nit is my people who must be destroyed.”\n“You’re kidding,” Syl said, walking hurriedly on his other side, still full\nsized.\n“I have not decided,” Szeth repeated calmly. “My quest is about this\ndecision.”\nGood, his spren whispered. Good. You see, and you grow.\n“Insanity,” Kaladin said. “The people in that building didn’t choose to\nreject you, Szeth. Maybe some of their leaders did, but the ordinary people\ndon’t deserve this punishment.”\nSzeth paused. There was wisdom in those words, wasn’t there? He …\nwavered.\nHe should not waver. The answer should be obvious. He needed to apply\nwhat he’d been taught by Nin-son-God, Herald and leader of the\nSkybreakers. Long ago, during his youth, Szeth had learned that his\njudgment was flawed. It had begun when he’d killed that soldier with the\nrock.\nFortunately, he had guides now. Nin, Dalinar. What would they do in this\nsituation? How would they face this question? Without further comment,\nSzeth strode toward the monastery. Nin and Dalinar would find answers,\nthen do what needed to be done. According to the law.\nThere had to be a standard. Without a standard, there was only chaos. If\na shaman had given orders to these people, then perhaps the monastery\nwould yield clues.\n“Szeth,” Kaladin said, taking his arm as he passed. “I’d really appreciate\nsome answers.”"

He pulled free and started up the\npath.\nThe monastery itself was a tall fortress. The monasteries in the East,\nparticularly Alethkar, always felt so … unimposing to Szeth. Here they\nwere places of war. Or more accurately, of preparation for war.\nOddly, Szeth realized, there was no wind blowing on this ridge.\n“That’s a monastery?” Syl said, hovering alongside as they continued up\nthe stone path across the steep mountain face.\n“They are watchtowers, each of them,” Szeth explained—because she\nwas a spren, and it would be impious to ignore her questions. “Set up by the\nHeralds, who conferred upon us Truth and charged us to be vigilant in case\nthe enemy returned.”\n“Why would they think the enemy would return?” Kaladin asked from\njust behind. “Everything I’ve been taught said the Heralds finished the war\nand the enemy was gone for good.”\n“Yes, they did tell you that,” Szeth said. “Didn’t they.”\n“Wait, wait,” Kaladin said, scrambling up beside him—then, finding the\npath too narrow, he moved out into the air with Syl, hanging over the cliff.\n“All this time the Shin knew that the enemy hadn’t been defeated? That the\nHeralds were among us?”\n“Obviously,” Szeth said. “We were the guardians of their swords. We\nwere entrusted with their Sacred Truth.”\n“The way you say that has the air of something important,” Syl said.\n“Utmost importance,” Szeth said. “The Sacred Truth of the Heralds is\nthe knowledge that the enemy would someday return. If Talmut ever broke.\nOn that day, we Shin would be needed to fight.” He reached the top of the\nclimb, then nodded back down the way. “The men who trained at the\nencampment? That was a hard life, to be despised. Those who trained—as I\neventually did—in the monasteries … they were to be something else\nentirely. True destroyers, most despicable and most glorious. Ready to face\nthe enemy.”\n“Then what happened?” Kaladin asked. “It’s been a year and a half since\nthe return of the singers.”\n“They did not believe. That is the entire reason we are here. Once again,\nplease pay attention.” With a grinding of boots on stone, Szeth strode to the\nfront gates of the monastery—and found them open. Was the place\nabandoned? The shamans should never have left those gates open; it was a\nblatant violation of Truth.\nSzeth stepped into the vaulted great hall inside, an enclosed courtyard\nwhere troops could gather and repel an assault. Cages full of gemstones\nwere built into the walls, with openings to the outside so they would\nautomatically recharge with the passing highstorms. Warm orange-tan light\nspeckled the great hall, illuminating the grand mural of Talmut on the floor.\nA depiction of him wrapped in chains, bound in Damnation, the Bearer of\nAgonies.\nOnly one person stood in the vast hall … and it was one of those who"

A middle-aged Shin woman, wearing the\nstark grey robes of a shaman. No hint of color, not even a splash. Grey hair\nthat might have once had some blond to it.\n“Rit?” he asked. “Rit-daughter-Clutio?”\n“Pilgrim,” she said, nodding to him, her voice echoing in the large empty\nhall.\nKaladin stepped up, likely to begin demanding answers. Szeth waved\nhim off, and fortunately he went, with Syl whispering interpretations to\nhim.\n“I am no pilgrim,” Szeth said. “I am Szeth-son—”\n“I know who you are,” she said, throwing aside her cloak. “I was there\nnine years ago. Do you remember?”\n“Banishment is not something a man forgets,” he whispered.\n“I was told you’d come sooner. It’s been months of waiting.”\nMonths? How did they know?\nShe raised her hands before her and summoned a Shardblade.\nUnornamented, shaped like a long wedge. A brutal weapon, lacking the\ngrace of its fellows, but somehow also more honest. A weapon that he’d\nseen depicted in art many times.\nTalmut’s Honorblade.\n“You had no leave to reclaim that,” Szeth said, summoning his own\nBlade. “Talmut should have his weapon.”\nYou don’t need that! Nightblood said from his back. I’m better than a\ndumb Shardblade made from a dumb spren. Use me!\n“Talmut broke,” the woman said. “He brought the Desolation. His Blade\nis better held by the worthy.”\n“Then why aren’t you fighting the enemy?” Szeth demanded. “What\nhappened to the Sacred Truth?”\nThe woman smiled. “I envy you. Oh, how I envy you, pilgrim, for the\nopportunity you are granted. Prepare to prove yourself.”\n“I’ve done so already,” he said. “I earned the right to bear an\nHonorblade.”\n“And where is it?” she asked him.\nStolen. Lost. In the hands of Moash, the traitor, leaving Szeth with only\nthe Blade he’d earned upon saying his Third Ideal. She obviously knew\nthat, so he did not respond.\n“You must cleanse that sin before being granted your glorious\nopportunity, pilgrim,” she said. “Nine years in the harsh lands of stone. Let\nus see what you’ve learned.”\nShe came for him slowly, stalking forward. Szeth backed up, then\nunstrapped Nightblood and thrust it toward Kaladin.\n“Hold it,” Szeth said. “Do not draw it. Do not intervene.”\n“What are you doing?” Kaladin asked. “What is this?”\n“What I, apparently, must do.”\nAzish crossbowmen started shooting straight into the control building\nthrough the doorways. But as Adolin watched from a distance with the\nspyglass, red lightning sprayed out in return. Stormforms.

Hulking, wicked singers who were among their best troops—\nnot on the level of a man in Plate, but at over seven feet tall, with strength\nand speed enhanced by their incredible form, they were more than a match\nfor the waiting Azish spearmen. Particularly blinded spearmen, potentially\nstunned and burned from the blasts of lightning.\nThe line started to crumple immediately.\n“It’s happening faster than I thought,” Adolin said to his scribe. “Warn\nmy support team, have May be prepared for Heavenly Ones, and tell my\nsoldiers to march in—but to not interfere with the Azish reserves.”\n“Yes, sir!” Kaminah said as he tossed back the spyglass. “Sir? Where\nwill you be waiting for them?”\n“Waiting?” Adolin said, pulling on his helmet. Then he threw himself off\nthe balcony.\nA drop of thirty feet was hazardous in Shardplate, but he couldn’t help\nbut feel a burst of excitement as he hit. His armor held up, and in seconds\nhe was charging across the open stone toward the battle.\nAnd … storms, it had been too long. He had forgotten the power of\nwearing Plate—indeed, he seemed faster than he remembered, each step\nlaunching him forward. Steel grinding rock. Barreling toward the conflict\nahead. Where …\nWhere the Azish held.\nTheir lines buckled, and their soldiers screamed. But counter to his fears,\ntheir lines managed to hold against the onslaught of enemy troops. Barely.\nThey’d break soon. Lightning, hulking direforms, followed by a flood of\nconventional warforms. The control building began flashing quickly, each\nflash depositing another platoon of soldiers who ran out, making room for\nothers to enter behind.\nEven he had underestimated how quickly they’d be able to deploy—and\nwhile the Azish performed better than he’d expected, the direforms made an\neffort to break through in one specific spot. They needed to puncture the\nring of Azish defenders, then flood out and try a surrounding maneuver.\nThat puncture point was where Adolin was needed. He arrived at\nblinding speed, skidding across the stones and summoning Maya in a flash.\nAn enterprising Azish officer at the rear shouted for his beleaguered men to\nmake room. They folded their line, executing the orders perfectly, and\nAdolin hit the enemy like a rushing river of steel and Blade.\nAdolin downed the first few direforms with flashes of Blade. The Azish\ngave him room, and the entire ring began to fall back as reserves from the\nperimeter joined them. Stormfather send that they’d see what his men were\ndoing and align their tactics.\nHe didn’t have time to look, as more and more Regals began turning his\ndirection. Shards were a luscious prize. He clashed with an enormous\ndireform who bore a shield that blocked his Shardblade. A Veden half-\nshard.

Those had started showing up on battlefields—plus shields lined in\naluminum, which could stop a Blade too.\nAdolin ducked a swing from the direform, who also wielded a massive\naxe—larger than any human could have held without Plate—then lunged\nexpertly, skewering the direform and dropping her. Behind that, stormforms\nunleashed lightning—and in the flashes, he was again reminded of\nSureblood’s death.\nIn honor of the fallen, he kept his cool. Adolin wasn’t his father, but\ntoday he’d have done the Blackthorn proud as he advanced, Maya whistling\nthrough the air as he engaged three direforms at once. His assault worked as\na distraction, drawing attention away from the Azish lines to allow them to\nretreat and help their wounded.\nAnd storms, for all he disliked the butchery of it, it was electric to fight\nwith Plate and Blade once more. He dropped two more direforms, then the\nPlate absorbed the lightning the stormforms tried to send at him—\ndissipating it somehow, vibrating against his skin. They should have known\nbetter. Though their lightning wasn’t terribly accurate, and they often loosed\nit when surprised.\nHe continued to smash through their ranks, taking a hit here and there,\ndropping a few more—but mostly keeping them distracted while shouts\nbehind him indicated his soldiers were forming up. He gave a quick glance,\nand was pleased to see the Azish following the lead of his troops: forming a\nlarger, wider ring of pikes and shields some thirty yards back in all\ndirections.\nThat gave the enemy more space to bring in troops, but it spread out\ntheir Regals. The enemy might consider this an initial victory, but it was all\naccording to Adolin’s plan. He prepared to withdraw—until Maya noticed\nsomething.\nThere, she said. Look what you’ve flushed out. Three.\nA glance showed him three figures rising into the air ahead of him, just\nabove the control room. Heavenly Ones would be needed to deal with a full\nShardbearer. Adolin took the chance to make a careful retreat, leaving a half\ndozen Regals on the ground with burning eyes. He was tempted to recover\ntheir half-shards, but that would have been foolhardy.\nHave you seen my support squad? Adolin asked.\nI can only see what you do, I’m afraid, Maya said. Or at least whatever’s\nin the direction you’re facing.\nWell, he’d trust in them. He withdrew farther as the three Heavenly Ones\nswooped toward him, each with a shield that could block his Blade.\nArrows started to pelt them.\nAdolin grinned. May’s team had been watching as requested. With the\nlonger Alethi range, and with the Azish having fallen back, her team had\nplenty of space to harry the Heavenly Ones. In minutes, the three Fused\nrealized they couldn’t engage Adolin while arrows were flying—and soared\noff to take care of the archers first.\nHopefully May and her team could deal with that. Adolin had his hands\nfull as more enemy troops surged toward him—his distraction working\nperhaps a little too well as the enemy noticed he was basically standing\nalone, unsupported. Fortunately, as he fought—moving from Windstance\ninto a defensive Stonestance—he heard familiar shouts approaching from\nbehind."

Fortunately, as he fought—moving from Windstance\ninto a defensive Stonestance—he heard familiar shouts approaching from\nbehind.\nIn moments, Colot had arrived with Adolin’s support squad. They fanned\nout behind him, staying far enough away that he wouldn’t hit them with\nsweeps of the Blade, but at the same time watching his flanks and\npreventing him from being surrounded.\nHe kept fighting, ripping aside a direform’s shield by grabbing it in his\nfree hand, then lunged with a one-handed strike, smoothly moving to\nVinestance—which focused on flexibility. He shocked his opponents by\nadvancing for a moment, confusing them, using his Blade in one hand and\nhis powerful fist in the other to smash away protections.\nA Shardbearer on the battlefield had once been the most dominant,\nterrifying, destructive force any man would ever see. A Shardbearer fully\nsupported by trained troops who knew not to get in his way, but also how to\nkeep him from being pulled down … well, it was still a force even Fused\nhad to respect. Adolin swept through enemy attackers, their eyes burning as\nthey fell dead. Each strike felt like a blow in the name of Kholinar, the city\nhe’d lost, the soldiers he’d abandoned.\nSoon, unnerved, the enemy began to pull away from him. And their\nretreat was hastened as three large screaming fireballs came flying through\nthe air, dripping flaming drops of oil. This wasn’t from the firetrap that\nKushkam had prepared, but from what Adolin’s forces called the Heavenly\nOne protocols. The three who had attacked the archers had been doused\nwith oil, then shot with flaming arrows.\nThe Fused would heal from the burns, but the fire and light would keep\nthem disoriented. Adolin grinned, kicking a direform aside. The Heavenly\nOnes streaked overhead, their outrageously filmy outfits proving to be a\nliability, as they retreated to the control building.\nTo your left.\nAdolin spun toward something he’d barely seen at the corner of his\nvision. He struck by instinct, and his Blade became longer by a few inches\nand speared straight through another flying Heavenly One—this one not on\nfire—her lance scraping across his armor and deflecting off.\nMaya cut the gemheart inside the Fused, and that was enough. The\ncreature’s eyes burned, same as any other singer, and she tumbled to the\nground. She’d be reborn, but not until the next Everstorm. That attack had\nbeen stealthier than the others—and she had somehow gone undetected by\nhis archers. Which put him on alert, something in him warning that it might\nhave been an intentional distraction.\nNearby, singers who had been pulling back suddenly surged forward.\nAdolin grunted, swinging out with his Blade in a wide sweep and dropping\nseveral. Then he danced backward—a moment too late as one specific\nsinger broke from the formation and moved with unexpected speed and\nfluidity, battering at Adolin with a pair of wicked maces.\nAnother Fused. But Adolin recognized this one.\nTall and imperious, a face mostly white, the pattern almost forming a\nglyph. It was the same Heavenly One that he and Shallan had fought in\nShadesmar. The one Adolin had wounded."

At\nleast one small fact was clear to him: he had a debt to settle with the woman\nin front of him. If Rit wanted a fight, he would certainly indulge her.\nThe floor turned liquid.\nStoneward, he thought with a curse, Lashing himself upward as the\nground tried to swallow him. The tiles began flowing and running as if\nsuddenly molten, the mural of Talmut the Herald mixing like wet paint.\nSzeth lurched upward. A Stoneward would have two Surges, and he’d\nnever faced this combination before. During his youth, they hadn’t\npossessed this Blade. Still, he could guess how she would fight. The\nflowing control of stone echoed a Willshaper, mixed with some limited\naccess to the strange abilities of a Bondsmith. It was a dangerous\ncombination, but then again, they all were.\nHe sought the protection of height. If this duel followed the rules of\nthose he’d fought when younger, leaving the room would be out of bounds.\nShe wouldn’t go so far as to destroy the monastery by warping the walls or\nceiling.\nThe ground rippled like the surface of a lake, then began to vibrate. A\ncolumn speared upward—a waterspout of stone bearing her at the top. It\nshowed amazing control of this Surge, more skillful than that of any\nWillshaper he’d known. She was good. And powerful … exceptionally\npowerful.\nShe must be using an incredible amount of Stormlight, he thought. How\nis she getting so much?\nRit speared straight at him atop her column of liquid stone, and as he\ndodged, the entire floor rose in a wave. Szeth flew around the top of the\nvaulted room, but there wasn’t space to flee. He was forced to engage her as\nshe rode the center of the wave of stone. Their Blades met with a sequence\nof clangs, forcing his back against the upper wall of the chamber. The liquid\nstone surged around Rit—enveloping her completely—and tried to wash\nacross Szeth.\nHis stomach jumped as he immediately Lashed himself downward,\nnarrowly avoiding the stone—which splashed on the wall. As Szeth neared\nthe ground, he saw an opening. She’d consolidated much of the liquid stone\nat the top to try to smash into him. This left gaps in the wave lower down.\nHe zipped through one of these gaps, and as he did, he heard a faint\ncracking sound. The stone hardening.

He remembered that sound well from\nhis time training with the Willshaper Blade.\nHe landed cautiously in a skid across the floor, now hard once more—\nbut uneven, a great portion of the stone forming a strange sloped and\ndistorted column up to the left, melding with the wall. Rit descended this\nslope quietly, bare feet on the rock, leaving footprints—Shardblade out.\n“She’s amazing,” Szeth whispered.\nYou are better, his spren said. Go. Destroy her.\n“It is a duel,” Szeth said. “It is not about destruction.”\nShe will kill you if she can, my squire. Imagine a slow death encased by\nstone, the whispers all around you …\nThat image was cold and sharp, like a spear through his chest. It made\nhim tremble, and something sparked inside him.\nControl it, the spren warned.\nSzeth nodded as Rit hopped down onto the warped stone ground. He felt\n… warm. The spren was speaking to him more than it usually did, and its\nattention felt approving. Like that of his father.\nYou have reached an important moment, Szeth, the spren said. Think of\nthat stone tomb. Anticipate it.\nSzeth danced forward, preparing to clash. His new Blade was starting to\nfeel comfortable in his hand, curved but understated—without overbearing\nornamentation. Rit’s weapon was straight. Talmut’s Blade seemed both less\nand more like a sword than many other Honorblades. So simple.\nSzeth swung three times in sweeping arcs, forcing Rit back. He was the\nbetter swordsperson, judging by her reaction times and stance. He tried to\nuse that, to throw her off balance so he could lay a hand on her and Lash her\nupward to gain an advantage. Unfortunately, the floor began to flow again,\nand he was forced into the air.\nThe proper way to fight someone like this was to keep moving—an\nexcellent strategy in any fight. He flew the length of the large front hall,\nthen rounded along the side and swept back down lower.\nBeneath him, the ground undulated. Liquid ripples trembling, the\ncolumn sloughing off and melting into the rest. The tiles re-formed just as\nthey’d been, the destruction undone. Such control. Again he was troubled\nby the power she exhibited. Honorblades used far more Stormlight than a\nRadiant did—as a Radiant’s oaths aligned them to the will of Honor,\nmaking them stronger vessels.\nAt this rate, he should have been able to run her out of power—but she\nshowed no signs of being concerned about that. Instead Rit vanished down\ninto the stone, not needing to breathe. Szeth watched, and once more fear\nsparked within him. As ordered, he imagined that stone enveloping him—\nthe panic it would inspire. He’d be alone with the whispers until he\nsuffocated.\nYes … his spren said. Are you ready to prove yourself?\n“It is not for me to decide, but you.”\nAn excellent answer. I am coming to genuinely like you, squire.

Soon the ground distorted in\na strange waveform, sections of stone rising up in a symmetrical pattern.\nA moment later, jets of it launched upward like streamers, trying to catch\nhim—splashing against the ceiling, then hardening. He narrowly wove\namong them, Lashing at the very edge of his skill. Each one of these new\ncolumns dropped the level of the floor a little, until an amazed Kaladin and\nSyl stood in the doorway before a drop of some twenty feet.\nThe stone had been drained as if from a pool to create a network of\ncolumns. Fortunately, Rit’s control over the stone didn’t extend so far as to\nlet her raise the entire thing up as spikes—she had to directly control a few\ncolumns at a time, freeze them, then move to a new batch. That gave him a\nchance.\nHe began slashing through columns as he passed, the Shardblade cutting\nchunks from the stone—but each soon resealed. Then more columns\nlaunched, trying to catch him. When they missed, they left behind another\nobstacle. Sweating, he drew in more Stormlight from the pouch at his waist.\nWhere was Rit getting this kind of strength? When he’d trained with the\nWillshaper Blade, he’d been able to affect an area of stone only two or three\nfeet wide.\n“Can you see her?” he asked the spren.\nNo. Prepare for the stone to capture you.\n“That will be the end.”\nWill it? You would give up your quest so easily?\n“I …” Szeth Lashed himself to the wall, changing gravity so he could\nrun along it as if it were the floor. He ducked beneath columns, then leaped\n—enhanced by a Lashing—over a flowing section of stone that tried to cut\nhim off.\n“I will fight until I am dead,” he whispered.\nNo.\n“I will fight,” Szeth revised with a grunt, restoring gravity and dropping\ndown a column of stone—scraping it with his fingers—to reach the\nundulating floor of the chamber. “I will fight until you tell me otherwise.”\nExcellent.\nHe plunged his sword into the ground, then Lashed his body upward just\nenough to hover, before continuing to zip through the room—slicing the\nground in large swaths. She would need to be near the surface somewhere\nto watch where he was.\nIt quickly became clear this method would not be effective. She could be\nhiding in any of the columns, and each new one created left more surface\narea to search—plus, being so low to the ground didn’t give him as much\ntime to react to new columns.\nThere was one way to make sure she emerged. It was time to see if his\nspren was guiding him correctly. He gave a glance upward and saw that\nKaladin had leaned out to watch. Then Szeth closed his eyes and landed.\nStone surrounded him. Swallowed him. Shadows became his entire\nworld as the liquid stone hardened, capturing him. A tomb, created in\nexactly his shape. It even held each finger in place around his Blade. He\ncouldn’t inhale. Not only was there no air, there was no room for his chest\nto expand."

Pressing against his cheeks, trapping his eyelids closed. So\nhe held his breath, and heard a clicking tremble on the stone as Rit emerged.\nWalking across the rock.\nI see her directly in front of you, the spren said. She has emerged as you\nhoped.\nYet the spren did not give him permission to use Division. The voices\ngrew louder.\nHe would die here. Encased in stone. He would run out of Stormlight\nand suffocate in a place black and terrible. Death did not frighten him, but\ndying here … failing in his quest …\nThat legitimately terrified him.\nHold, the spren said.\nHis Stormlight was running out. He could feel it trickling away, and the\nvoices condemned him for his murders. He could touch the second power,\naccess it—and in so doing, free himself in an instant.\nHold, the spren said.\nSweating, trembling, almost whimpering, he held.\nSome of the others said that you were not diligent or worthy, the spren\nsaid, because you did not choose the law as your guide. But now … now I\nprove them wrong. Well done, Szeth.\nIt was still. Not. Permission.\nYou may use your second Surge, the spren said. Fight. As a full\nSkybreaker.\nFinally. Szeth swelled with a power that was immediately familiar. The\nstone had captured him, holding him, but that allowed him to touch it. Time\nto burn.\nHe exhaled Stormlight in a rush, infusing the stones around him with a\nmounting destruction. The column became char, the stone itself set alight.\nSzeth ripped from it, trailing ash like a second—no, third—shadow, pieces\nof it crumbling from his face. He forced his eyes open and lunged, Blade\npointed forward, at something moving in front of him. Rit walking close to\ninspect her handiwork.\nHe set the very air alight as he moved.\nSkybreaker.\nRit opened her mouth to scream, and he plunged his Blade straight\nthrough, out the back of her skull, into the next column of stone.\nHer Blade dropped from her fingers.\nShe fell forward on his Blade, the top of her mouth catching on the rear\nedge of the weapon and holding her pinned—until Szeth commanded that\nedge of the Blade to become sharp. Then the corpse fell straight past it,\nleaving a slice this time—because the body was dead.\nThere was no blood.\nSzeth hesitated, frowning. He knelt beside the corpse and heard the\nfaintest words whispered from what should have been dead lips. “Your\nfamily awaits you, pilgrim.”\nHe stumbled back then, as the body disintegrated. Becoming black\nsmoke, leaving only empty clothing behind.\nAdolin faced off against the Fused who had named himself Abidi the\nMonarch.

Unfortunately, the Heavenly One\nexpertly diverted his Blade by hitting it on the flat with one mace, then\nmanaged to ring Adolin’s bell with the other—hitting him square in the side\nof his head.\nHis helmet cracked, but held. Adolin grunted and retreated—but at that\nmoment a pair of warforms dove for his legs, toppling him. Storms, he’d\nbeen ready for this, and they’d still gotten him. As good as his team was at\nhandling Fused these days, the enemy were equally prepared to bring down\nShardbearers.\nHe dropped Maya and punched, sending one of the singers flying, then\nhe rolled and kicked the other free. Abidi slammed his maces down, hitting\nstone as Adolin barely managed to roll out of the way.\nAdolin’s support squad was there a moment later, filling in around him.\nSeveral would be carrying roped hooks to try pulling him—or at least the\narmor—to safety, but as he pushed up to one knee, they’d see he didn’t need\nthat. Instead they engaged the Heavenly One. A near-suicidal act, but the\nShardbearer needed to be preserved. As Adolin gathered his bearings, he\nsaw one man in particular—a bearded fellow he didn’t recognize, with long\nwhite Thaylen eyebrows and a white mustache—protecting him. The man\nstood squarely between the Fused and Adolin.\nThe Fused prepared to swing at the fellow, but Adolin growled, forming\nMaya and hurling her in a flash of spinning metal to slam into the Fused’s\nside. Adolin missed the gemheart, but got the attention of Abidi—who\nturned away from the soldier and glared at Adolin.\nAdolin summoned Maya back to him—an action that was instantaneous\nnow—and found his feet. The bearded Thaylen soldier stabbed the Fused\nwith a spear, but the creature yanked it out and swept the man aside,\nadvancing on Adolin. “It is you,” the Fused growled in accented Alethi.\n“The Bondsmith’s son.”\nAdolin leveled Maya. “I thought I killed you,” he said. “Guess I’ll have\nto do it again.”\n“You did not defeat me,” the Fused growled. “I survive for the end of all\nthings. I will not go to Braize to await rebirth, and miss the glory of this\nconquest. I am Abidi the Monarch, and this land is mine. I will claim this\ncity.”\nStorms. Bless the Fused for their insistence on announcing their titles\nand accolades; it gave Adolin time to set his stance. Most of his support\nsquad held off, wary—now that Adolin had his Blade resummoned, he\nneeded space. He gave a quick sign, sweeping his left hand to the side, two\nfingers out. They began to reorganize, falling back, and Adolin—eyes on\nthat Fused—helped the brave Thaylen man to his feet and sent him off with\nthe others.\nThe Fused, of course, used that opening to attack, as Adolin had\nexpected.

They clashed, and storms, those maces were lined in aluminum—\nfor Adolin tried and failed to slice one in half. He exchanged a few more\nblows with the Fused, but the creature was skilled. Last time, in Shadesmar,\nAbidi had mostly ignored Adolin, which had let Adolin get in an easy hit.\nAbidi wasn’t flying, and the red light of his eyes pulsed, stuttered.\nMaybe Adolin had nicked the gemheart in Shadesmar, making it unable to\nhold enough Voidlight for Lashings. Unfortunately, the Fused was a skilled\nenough duelist that he didn’t need to fly—and Adolin, after just a short\nengagement, realized he didn’t need to prove anything by defeating this\ncreature.\nHe backed up, then gave the signal to his team. Together, they began to\nwithdraw.\n“You run from me?” Abidi said. “You refuse me the honor of the fight?”\n“Some other time perhaps,” Adolin said, jogging backward. Abidi\ntwitched as if to give chase, then glanced at the line of bodies that Adolin\nhad left, maybe realizing that letting himself be drawn too far forward\nwithout support of his own would be certain death.\nInstead Abidi spun and walked away through the ranks of gathering\nsingers. So, this Fused wasn’t one of the completely crazy ones. That was\ndisappointing, but Adolin had a battle to win. He turned and approached a\nwide ring of human troops who now circled the platform at about the\nhalfway point. Spearmen at the front with large shields, pikemen behind—\ncapable of reaching over the front-rank soldiers to attack.\nThe large ring gave a lot of space in the center for the singers to bring in\ntroops—which Adolin knew would be excruciating for the defenders to\nwatch. Still, he was pleased by how quickly the Azish had responded,\njoining to make this formation.\nHe slipped past the ranks, and there spotted Kushkam on his horse. The\nman was looking at the ceiling, and the oil bags suspended far above.\nAdolin knew immediately what he was thinking: There were a lot of singers\ngathering at the center of the field now. Why not retreat and drop the fire to\nkill thousands?\nThat would cost them the city. Adolin shook his head, then held up a\nhand, pleading. Kushkam noticed him. Adolin waited an anxious moment,\nthen the commandant raised a tasseled spear and pointed forward. That …\nthat seemed an order to hold and not retreat.\nAdolin relaxed as the next part played out. The singers formed up and\nadvanced, but they weren’t nearly as skilled at holding formations as\nhumans. Each singer—even the warforms—was stronger, but they relied on\nmomentum, intimidation, and strength to overwhelm.\nThis advance worked more poorly than the initial one had. Once they\ndrew close enough, arrows started to fall, and the Azish had the chance to\nput their killing field into practice. Singers tried to block them with shields,\nbut enough arrows fell that it disrupted their lines.

Adolin recognized the\ndistinctive kchunk of crossbows being cocked from within the Azish lines.\nThose heavy Thaylen weapons took time to load and crank, but storms they\npacked a punch. He saw one bolt go clean through a singer’s breastplate,\nshattering the carapace. The crossbowmen—shooting from the Azish\nground ranks—were able to target the Regals, then fall back once the\nenemy arrived.\nThe human lines held against the following clash, and the one afterward.\nAdolin barely had to jump in and support with his Plate. A half hour later, it\nwas over. The enemy wasn’t defeated—not by far—but they’d obviously\nhoped to win this initial clash quickly. The human ring of defenders started\nto press inward, advancing, and—distantly—Abidi called the retreat. His\nforces pulled back to the control building. Then, surprisingly, they retreated\ninto Shadesmar, one group at a time.\nThey’re leaving? Maya asked.\nNot for good, I’m sure, Adolin thought. But they’ll be safe from our\narchers and any attacks in Shadesmar. Likely they know they need to revise\ntheir assault plan.\nAdolin squinted and picked out Abidi the Monarch glaring in his\ndirection.\nThat one is dangerous, Maya said. I know him from before. One of their\nbest duelists, and often a leader among them.\nHe doesn’t fly, Adolin thought to Maya. Is that because I hit him in\nShadesmar?\nIt happens sometimes. A crack can interfere with their powers. Normally\nthey die and are reborn. But …\nIf this one dies, Adolin realized, he risks missing out on the remaining\nbattle. There would be only one more Everstorm before Dalinar’s contest,\nand not every Fused was able to find a host every Everstorm.\nWorse, Maya thought, he’d have to give up command to a different\nFused, who would get the glory of claiming the city.\nAdolin walked among painspren, guarding Azish squads who advanced\nto check the fallen for wounded. The enemy didn’t take this chance to surge\nout and attack again, so for the time being the skirmish had been won.\nHis gut said that the enemy would lick their wounds and strategize, now\nthat they knew they wouldn’t take the city quickly. So he gave the order for\nhis people to head out, letting the Azish keep ranks inside the dome. As he\nturned to go, he pointedly raised a fist to the distant archers in thanks. May\nwould be watching with her spyglass.\nThat was well-handled, Maya said.\nThank you, he said back. But I still have work to do; we can’t leave the\nAzish feeling humiliated.\nHe’d need this army unified and working together. So he hurried to put\nthe next part into motion.\nThere, we will find our destiny. We cannot stop him from\ndestroying us. It is time.\nDid I do that?” Szeth asked as Rit vanished to dust and black smoke. The\nfire in the air went out, and a rushing sound surrounded him.\nHis spren did not reply.\n“What in Damnation was that?” Kaladin asked, dropping down beside\nhim with Syl.\n“Honorbearer,” Szeth said. “Stoneward.”"

Only in special circumstances.”\nYour life is a special circumstance now, Szeth, it said. You may use the\npower until I tell you otherwise.\nSzeth took in a deep breath, his full weight coming upon him as his\nLashings ran out. He looked around the chamber, the beautiful mural\nconsumed by the strange art of the Stoneward. Some sixty columns reached\nfrom floor to ceiling, like sinew. The floor had dropped tens of feet in the\nbattle. The chamber was ruined.\n“Something is odd here,” Szeth said, turning and fixating upon Talmut’s\ndropped Blade, which Syl had leaned down to inspect.\n“Just one thing?” Kaladin said.\n“Dalinar has mentioned the disappearance of Talmut’s—or Taln’s—\nBlade,” Szeth said, walking over. He hesitated, then picked it up. “It would\nhave been carried by Talmut when he returned from Damnation. Yet when\nhe arrived at the Shattered Plains, his Blade had been swapped for another.”\n“I’ve heard,” Kaladin said. “But—”\n“My people must have retrieved it,” Szeth said. “How did they find him\nso quickly? Why leave him with a different Blade as a ruse?”\nWas he to go on a full pilgrimage, visiting each of the monasteries in\nturn? He rose up toward the doorway, Kaladin and Syl following, then\ndismissed his Blade. With Talmut’s Honorblade, he cut free some of the\ngemstones in the wall. Kaladin did likewise, gathering Stormlight of his\nown. Blasphemy, perhaps, but his spren did not order him to stop. This\nmonastery was ruined anyway.\n“I know you like to be mysterious,” Kaladin said, hovering beside him,\n“but could you please explain?”\nThe man would pester him unless it was spelled out, wouldn’t he? “Rit\nspoke of a pilgrimage,” Szeth said. “That is something from my younger\nyears. To bear one of the Blades of the Heralds is an … honor. A great and\nterrible honor. Among my people, none but the best warriors were allowed\nthis duty.\n“As such, the training and path to become an Honorbearer was arduous.\nYou needed to practice with each Blade, then pick one and defeat its owner\nin a fight using no powers. Then, with that Blade, you needed to face each\nof the other seven Honorbearers. We call it a pilgrimage of Truth. If you\nwere successful, you would be allowed to join their ranks. You could try\nonly once.”\n“You … did this?” Syl asked. “When you were younger?”\n“Yes,” Szeth said. “First I traveled to each monastery to train. I won the\nBlade of Jezrien, whom we call Yesoran. Then I went with that Blade to\nface my former teachers. Instead I was exiled. With it. Years ago.” He"

Years ago.” He\nlanded in the doorway. “And now when I arrive home, Rit claims I am on a\npilgrimage again.”\n“Last night Ishar told me,” Kaladin said, “that he’d speak with me once\nyour pilgrimage was finished.”\nSzeth nodded. “I met Ishu last week. I … was not emotionally strong\nduring that encounter. Ishu said he’d killed my father, and warned that the\nShin had accepted the Unmade. He implied he’d saved them.”\n“The people don’t look very saved to me,” Kaladin said, landing beside\nhim as they started back down the path.\n“I worry that the Herald is unreliable,” Szeth said. “I do not know that\nwe can trust what he said.”\n“He claims to be the Almighty,” Kaladin said. “And he perpetuated a war\nfor years in southern Makabak. You’re right; anything he says is going to be\nunreliable.”\nSzeth held up Talmut’s Honorblade as he descended the path. “Our\nSacred Truth is that the enemy would return, and we would need to fight\nthem with the Honorblades. One at each monastery …”\n“So … we have to retrace the path you took as a youth?” Syl said. “Is\nthat how we cleanse your homeland?”\n“It is a start,” Szeth said. “A direction.”\n“I don’t like it,” Kaladin said, arms folded, hovering along out over the\ncliff. Of course he had to complain. “We’re being manipulated—and by\nsomeone who is obviously delusional.”\n“And what would you do instead?” Szeth asked him. “I must at least\nvisit another monastery to investigate. Perhaps the other shamans will speak\nto me, or perhaps they will attack me. Either action will give us more\ninformation.”\n“Szeth,” Kaladin said, taking him by the arm. “What if we went straight\nto the Bondsmith monastery? Would Ishar be there?”\n“What do you think?” Szeth asked. “You just said he’s unreliable. If we\nignore his instructions, would he simply appear and answer your\nquestions?”\nKaladin thought a moment, then gave the answer he plainly didn’t like.\n“No,” he admitted. “He was quite explicit—he wants you to complete your\nquest, and he wants me to help you. If we’re going to hunt him down, we’ll\nat least need more information on what is happening.”\n“You came here to help Ishu-son-God see clearly,” Szeth said. “I think\nshowing you are earnestly helping will do a great deal. Come.”\nKaladin hovered in place, studying Szeth. The Windrunner was\nannoying, but smart. Perhaps that was why he was annoying. “I’m\nworried,” Kaladin said. “I’m supposed to return with help for Dalinar, but\n… but Wit said I won’t be able to. Not in time, surely. Maybe not at all …”\nHe looked behind him at the monastery. “There’s power here, of a type I\nhaven’t ever seen …”\n“And?” Szeth asked.\n“… And you’re probably right.

Seeing if the other Honorbearers will talk\nto us is the best way to proceed.” He sighed. “How close is the next\nmonastery?”\n“Not too far,” Szeth said. “It would take a few days walking, but we can\nuse some Stormlight and arrive tomorrow.”\nWith a nod, Kaladin joined him along with Syl, walking back down the\npathway. Soon they heard voices.\nPeople from the encampment had left the buildings and were gathering\nin the sunlight.\nAdolin gave an excited leap as he left the dome. He soared some ten feet\nbefore slamming to the ground, meeting his soldiers, who had formed up\noutside following the battle.\nHis father would have given a fine speech. Adolin ripped his helmet off,\nheld it high in one hand with his Shardblade in the other, and bellowed a\nvibrant yell of triumph, exploding with gloryspren. His soldiers shouted\ntheir enthusiasm in a roar, raising weapons.\n“Colot!” Adolin said. “How many fallen do we need to mourn today?”\n“Six wounded, sir,” Colot called back. “None dead among our men.”\nNone? The Azish had certainly lost some, but to have his men fight\nwithout dying? Adolin let out another shout, mirrored by his soldiers. This\nfelt good. He went among them, letting them bang their fists on his Plate, as\nhe’d done with other troops before life had become so complicated and his\nfather’s rules so strict.\nMorale wasn’t just about official commendations or even about\nincreased rations or pay after a victory. It was about the soldiers knowing\nthat Adolin personally was proud of them. How would they know that if\nthey couldn’t see him?\nI am proud, Maya said. I want to join.\nFeel like letting others carry you? he asked.\nYes, she said, sounding surprised. The sword. I will make it dull. Let them\ncarry it.\nMost people never had the chance to hold a Shardblade. So Adolin\npicked out the Thaylen man from earlier, then summoned Maya and held\nher out.\nThe entire group grew hushed, their eyes opening wide.\n“The Blade remains bonded to me,” Adolin said, “but she wishes to join\nyour celebrations. Hold her high! I’m going to go talk to the emperor. I’ll\nsummon the sword back when I need it.” He let the man reverently hold\nMaya, then raise her high with a shout.\nAdolin slipped out from among them. He admittedly was a tad anxious\nletting go of Maya—but it felt meaningful. Colot jogged up beside him as\nhe walked away. “I’ve never seen a Shardbearer act like this,” he said.\n“Aren’t you afraid someone will steal it?”\n“It’s basically impossible without killing me. Besides, these men were\nbrave enough to volunteer for an isolated and risky deployment. They’re\nour best, Colot.” He put an armored hand on the man’s shoulder. “You are\nour best, my friend. You executed those maneuvers perfectly.”\n“Well, I’m glad someone wants me,” he said.\n“Those Windrunners will someday realize what they missed out on,”\nAdolin said, then nodded toward the crowd. “Who is that Thaylen fellow?”"

He’s got skill, so I used him to plug a hole in your\npersonal guard. He seems specifically loyal to you for some reason, but he\ndoesn’t speak a lick of Alethi so I haven’t been able to ask.”\n“I don’t recognize him,” Adolin said. “Get him a uniform, and formally\ninduct him into the Cobalt Guard. He stared down a Heavenly One and kept\nhis wits.”\n“It will be done,” Colot said, then gestured toward the emperor—who\nwas still seated on a podium set up by his palanquin. An ornate, if portable,\nthrone. “They tried to move him once the fighting started, and I think he\nrefused. Also, I believe that Kushkam will give you trouble. He was livid\nabout how things played out.”\nColot pointed toward the beefy Azish commandant, who was\napproaching the emperor with a bowed back and a shamed posture.\n“I think you might be wrong about that,” Adolin said. “Go and make\nsure I didn’t accidentally start a riot by letting them hold the sword—and\nhave my soldiers set up my tent in a spot near our barracks. Oh, and make\nsure the worst of the Azish wounded get healing from May’s budding\nRadiant ward. I’ll handle Kushkam.”\n“Better you than me,” Colot said, with a quick salute before trotting off.\nAdolin was still tailed by several scribes and two bodyguards, but he was\nused to that sort of thing. He clomped up to Yanagawn and his attendants,\nhelm under his arm, in time to catch Kushkam giving a report.\n“… will see that the field inside is covered in debris, as Kholin\nsuggested,” the commandant was saying toward Noura, his head bowed as\nhe knelt before the emperor, his hand outstretched in a penitent way—\nshamespren falling like flower petals around it. “I understand now that our\nassault tactics were faulty.” He glanced toward Adolin, then bowed his head\nlower. “In addition, I must offer—”\n“May I interrupt?” Adolin asked, giving a quick bow to the emperor. “If\nit’s all right?”\n“Please,” Yanagawn said, sitting up in his seat. “What is your\nperspective, Adolin?”\n“I’m impressed,” Adolin said. “You have a fantastic military here,\nExcellency.”\nKushkam glanced at him, frowning.\n“By our reports, we wonder if that statement is true,” Noura said,\nstanding behind the Prime’s seat, decked out in robes that looked far too\nhot, even if the sun was close to setting by now. “Our lines bowed\nimmediately and failed to anticipate enemy maneuvers, requiring your\nsalvation.”\n“Pardon, Noura,” Adolin said. “But I’m a Shardbearer.

Jumping into the\naction when things go wrong is my storming job.” He turned and pointed to\nan Azish company that had left the dome to lick its wounds while others\nfilled in to stand watch. “I don’t know how much direct battlefield\nobservation you’ve done, but any plan can fall apart on any battlefield.\n“The commandant’s strategy didn’t work—but when it didn’t, he and his\narmies quickly reassessed. They fell in to the next best plan, and held. A\nwell-executed pivot like that is one of the single best hallmarks of a\ndisciplined and well-trained military.”\n“One might question his skill if he made such a big mistake,” Noura\npressed. “You were right and he was wrong.”\n“And on other battlefields, I’ve been wrong,” Adolin said. “Look,\nKushkam isn’t used to how Fused and Regals fight, and that got us into\ntrouble today. But he adapted. Moreover, my own officers all thought\nKushkam’s plan would be effective. He’s neither a bad officer nor a bad\ntactician. He made one incorrect call, but then fixed it. I’m honored to be\nable to serve with him and his troops.”\nTo his relief, a lone sincerityspren—like opening blue fronds—appeared\nnext to him, giving testament to the fact that he genuinely believed what he\nwas saying. They all regarded it silently, then Kushkam slowly climbed to\nhis feet.\n“Well,” the emperor said, “I suppose we should celebrate, if not in such a\n… boisterous manner as your troops, Adolin. The day is won.”\n“They will be back,” Kushkam said, gazing directly at Noura. “Vizier,\nthey might try to push through again immediately, assuming that we will be\nresting.”\n“Kushkam is correct,” Adolin said. “They have an army of fresh troops\nwaiting for battle. Their blitz attack having failed, they’ll likely realize their\nbest move now is to try to tire us out.”\n“Agreed,” Kushkam said. “They will regroup, give new orders, and plan\nhow to wear us down—run us out of defenders and break through. The next\nfew days will be grueling.”\n“I have some thoughts on how to approach that, Commandant,” Adolin\nsaid. “If you’d like to hear them.”\n“I think I would,” he said, then bowed to the emperor, who waved that\nhe could withdraw.\nBefore joining him, Adolin stepped closer to Yanagawn. “Hey,” he said\nsoftly. “Hear you didn’t leave when they tried to make you.”\n“Yeah,” Yanagawn said, then sat up a little straighter, as if remembering\nnot to slouch. “I mean, indeed, I thought it best to maintain a strong\npresence here—to indicate faith in the troops.” He smiled at Adolin. “And\n… sometimes I want to be part of events.”\n“I’ll be camping out here on this square, near where my men are\nbarracked. Need to be close, as the enemy will attack at night to test us.\nWant to do the same?”\nYanagawn blinked. “You’re … inviting me to a campout?”"

Need to be close, as the enemy will attack at night to test us.\nWant to do the same?”\nYanagawn blinked. “You’re … inviting me to a campout?”\n“We call them bivouacs in the military,” Adolin replied, with a grin.\n“There should be some time between the fights. I could give you a little\ntraining. Let you swing a Shardblade, practice wearing Plate. You should\nknow how to use it, since you own several sets yourself.”\nAdolin was pretty sure an emperor wasn’t supposed to gawk like that,\njaw gaping, eyes alight. He recovered a moment later, then glanced at\nNoura.\n“I wouldn’t recommend it,” she said carefully. “You are not like an\nEastern ruler. You aren’t needed on the front lines. Your role is to inspire\nand provide leadership.”\n“We won’t put him on the front lines, Noura,” Adolin said, “not unless it\nbecomes absolutely necessary. But he’s about the age I was when I tried\nwinning my own Blade in a duel.”\n“It’s different,” she said. “You didn’t represent an entire empire. As long\nas the emperor is on his throne, Azimir stands. Without him, we are in\nchaos.”\n“Yes,” Adolin said, “but this is the storming end. If the enemy wins this\ncity, there won’t be an empire. You understand that, right?”\nShe hesitated. “And what good is one more teenager on the battle lines?”\nshe finally asked.\n“Depends,” Adolin said. “If that teenager is the emperor himself, coming\nto prove to the troops precisely how vital their defense is? It could be the\nmost important thing he ever does.” He looked to Yanagawn. “There are\ntimes when I saw Gavilar step onto the field, and every eye turned toward\nhim. He didn’t need to raise a Blade, but when the men knew he was there\n—that he was committed—it changed the way they fought. It’s not your\nway, but it might be worth trying.”\n“I’ll do it,” Yanagawn said, keeping his gaze directed at Adolin as Noura\nreleased a soft sigh. “Will you teach me that game you mentioned?”\n“Towers?” Adolin said. “Absolutely.” He nodded and withdrew, jogging\nup to Kushkam, who was waiting nearby. They began walking back toward\nthe bulk of the men, trailed by Adolin’s attendants—who kept far enough\nbehind to let them speak in private.\n“What did I do wrong?” Kushkam asked in a low voice. “Why did the\nline nearly break? I thought the strategy was so sound.”\n“The enemy has, by my best count, around two hundred Regals,” Adolin\nsaid. “I think I might have killed around ten today, plus one—of maybe ten\n—Fused, who might not be able to be reborn in time to rejoin the fight.\nRegardless, Kushkam, you assumed a few of your soldiers were a match for\na few of theirs. Forming up close to the control room like you did let them\nleverage only their strongest soldiers against ours.”\nHe groaned softly. “It really was a Stuko Stem.”\n“Afraid so.”\n“I feel so stupid.”\n“If it means anything,” Adolin said, “I was being honest earlier—my"

But it’s\nhard to give up what feels like an advantageous position.”\n“So what we should do,” he said, “is what your army demonstrated. We\nform solid pike walls farther back, and force them to come to us—make\nthem spread their Regals out, so they can’t pit a hundred of them against a\nhundred humans. They have to instead pit a hundred Regals plus nine\nhundred regular soldiers against a thousand of mine.”\n“Exactly,” Adolin said. “Plus, you will have archer support, and the time\n—during their advance—to position our Shardbearers wherever the enemy\nsends most of their elite troops. And anything that slows their advance gives\nus more time to try to bring Regals down from a distance.”\n“Hence the suggestion that we throw furniture in the way,” Kushkam\nsaid. “I still feel like a failure. Did you … hear they took that imperial\nSoulcaster?”\n“Storms, no,” Adolin said. “I was distracted by fighting.”\n“A flying Fused grabbed him and towed him to the portal while we were\nfirst regrouping.”\nAdolin took a deep breath. “Poor man.”\n“He was almost gone to the Soulcaster disease,” Kushkam said. “But I\nhate to have caused this. I …” He sighed. “I was too intimidated by an\nAlethi coming to take over my city. I apologize.”\n“As do I,” Adolin said. “I put you on the spot earlier by offering\nsuggestions in front of the emperor—ones you didn’t have time to consider.\nThat forced you to make a decision immediately. I should have known\nbetter, and come to you in private to explain my concerns.”\nKushkam grunted. “They warned me about you.”\n“They?”\n“Some of my men,” he said, stopping and turning to face Adolin, who\nwas taller by an inch or two—but not nearly so bulky. Kushkam looked him\nup and down with one eye, the other a tattooed hole. “They said you’d win\nme over. I said that you were a fop, a dandy who was more interested in\nclothing and duels than warfare.”\n“I think, actually,” Adolin said, “both of you were right. I’d much, much\nrather be choosing tomorrow’s wardrobe than be here killing. You?”\nKushkam waited an uncomfortably long moment. Then he smiled,\nholding out his hand. “Absolutely.”\nWith relief, Adolin took his hand.\n“You like to use first names,” Kushkam said. “I’m Zarb, Adolin. I\nappreciate what you did today. You saved lives.”\n“It’s why I’m here,” Adolin said. “I promise.”\n“You should be in command.”\n“Respectfully, no,” Adolin said. “I have more experience fighting the\nsingers, but you know your troops and this city. Beyond that, when this is\nover, I get to go back to Urithiru. You have to live with what we do here."

I promise I’ll do my best not to undermine you any\nfurther—but also to make it very clear when I disagree.”\n“Remarkable,” the man said, shaking his head. “You’re really the son of\nthe Blackthorn?”\nAdolin didn’t reply. Because while yes, he was Dalinar’s son … he\nwasn’t always sure if he was the son of the Blackthorn.\nKushkam’s eyes grew distant as he gazed at the dome. “I’d hoped,” he\nsaid quietly, “to win decisively today—to kill hundreds while they tried to\npush through. I understand your strategy now, and agree … but Adolin, if\nwe have to field pike walls and hold …”\n“It will get brutal,” Adolin agreed softly. “We’ll have an advantage as the\ndefender, but they can afford to lose four to every one they kill.”\n“These soldiers are good men,” Kushkam said. “Our best. They will\nfight, and they will hold, but … we’re looking at high casualties until the\nmain army arrives. I wish you hadn’t been right.”\n“So do I, Zarb,” Adolin said.\n“My officers and I are setting up our tents over in that area,” Kushkam\nsaid, pointing. “I want to be near the fighting, and have refused better\naccommodations farther inside the city. Would you dine with us this\nevening, Adolin? I want you to meet my command staff. If they get to know\nyou, it may help keep them from resenting you.”\n“I’d be honored,” Adolin said. “Thank you. Let me make sure my men\nare properly quartered, and I’ll join you in … say, an hour?”\n“Excellent,” he said, then glanced at the dome again, seeming reserved.\nFinally, he marched toward the pavilions being erected.\nAdolin took a deep breath. Winning over the Azish command structure\nshould have felt fantastic, and it did, but …\nIt was going to be brutal. He’d saved the day, but worse ones were\ncoming. Far worse.\nYou feel sad, Maya said. Uncertain.\n“Just still finding my place in all of this. I’ll figure it out. I will protect\nthis city.”\nI’m worried about the way you say things like that, Adolin.\n“Just being confident.”\nAnd it doesn’t reach deeper?\nHe wasn’t certain. He took a seat at the edge of the square, on a wall by a\nfountain. He looked over the enormous bronze dome, reflecting the light of\na setting sun.\n“I want to be enough,” he said. “I’m nothing more than a man with a\nsword and armor. That used to be enough.” Once, he’d been the best. Now\nthat didn’t matter.\nI feel that’s not who you are, Adolin, she said. But storms, I can’t say. I\nknow you, but I don’t know you.\nHe nodded, understanding the meaning.

We’re going to lose\nso many.”\nOnly three days of fighting. Until the reinforcements.\n“And if they don’t come?” Adolin asked. “Or if the enemy gets more\nRegals?”\nYou … might be right to worry about that. I saw some Heavenly Ones\nleave the group earlier—two of them, leaving them with seven, now that you\nkilled one. Those two could be going to fetch help, since the initial attack\nwas turned back.\nHe took another deep breath.\nIt used to be enough. He used to be enough. Storms, he missed Shallan\nalready. Her voice always helped.\nHe hoped she was safe, wherever she was.\nHe stood and walked toward the others, trying to think of something\nmore he could do here. As he drew closer, he saw soldiers holding his\nsword in a reverent posture. Colot was making sure there was no riot,\nmaking them take turns. But seeing this, Adolin couldn’t help imagining\nwhat would happen to his troops if a legitimate force of Fused were brought\nin. Regals were trouble enough; if there were Deepest Ones in this army,\nthey could swim out through the stones to flank his people. A single\nMagnified One, and then a single Husked One, had given Kaladin trouble.\nAnd even aside from Fused … he was still looking at high casualties\nover the next few days. That was why the Mink had been so uncertain about\nthis defense. Adolin couldn’t help imagining his troops getting slaughtered.\nCouldn’t help remembering the cries from his troops in Kholinar, when\nhe’d left them.\nHe needed an edge. Something to help.\n“Do you remember,” he said, thinking back to a few days ago, “those\nspren who left Lasting Integrity right as we did?” When those honorspren\nobjectors had abandoned the fortress, he had met the eyes of a few. They’d\nbeen among those who had taken up the call, Honor is not dead …\nI do, Maya said.\n“I wonder,” Adolin said, “if we could … I don’t know, get them to come\nand lend us their powers or something …”\nIt felt foolish when he said it. What could they do here? Maya, however,\ngrew excited.\nI can talk now, Adolin. I feel better. I can persuade them! I could go to\nthem.\n“Could you?”\nI can move with the beads. All of us deadeyes do it. I think … I think this\ncould work! Even if it takes a few days, I might be able to get back here in\ntime!\nHuh. “How confident are you?”\nReasonably confident.\nWell … that was interesting. Now that she was speaking more, perhaps\nshe could persuade the honorspren. He could certainly use some more\nRadiants.\n“The timing doesn’t seem like it will work,” he said, thinking of how\nlong it took to bond and train a Radiant.\nI can make it work. If you trust me.\n“Always,” Adolin said.\nBut … to do this … I’d have to go."

She’d slip away in Shadesmar, into\nthe bead ocean. On a battlefield like this, he didn’t need a Blade. Blades\nwere excellent for duels, but nothing beat the power of Plate when fighting\nmultiple foes. Azimir had some Shardhammers—large conventional\nweapons designed to be swung by a person in Plate. He could use one of\nthose, and be nearly as effective. But still …\nHe felt Maya’s emotions, so eager, so certain. She seemed completely\nconfident she could bring him those honorspren to help against the Fused.\nShe wanted to do it so badly, and he’d sworn to himself that she wasn’t his.\nHe didn’t decide for her.\n“I support,” he found himself saying, “whatever decision you make.”\nI will go, she said, sounding eager. Try not to summon me. That will start\nmy journey over. Only if you are in dire need.\n“I understand,” he said.\nAnd the sword, in May Aladar’s hands, vanished of its own accord.\nStorms, Adolin thought as he felt Maya immediately start to grow distant.\nHow many men had given up their Shardblade like that? He thought she\nwould come back, but …\nAll of the Radiants did it once, he thought. And there was one other. My\nfather.\nAdolin considered that, filled with complex emotions, as he ran to check\non his troops. After that, he spent the evening doing his best to win over\nKushkam’s officers—all the while worried about Maya. And all the while\nconfident that he’d made the right choice—because it was the decision his\nheart demanded.\nKaladin glanced over his shoulder as he hiked with Szeth down toward the\nencampment. “Syl,” he whispered, “have you ever seen a Stoneward with\nthat kind of strength?”\n“No,” she replied, hovering beside him. “But I didn’t live during the\ndays of the Heralds.”\n“What was powering her?” Kaladin said. “She didn’t drain a single\ngemstone in the wall—and when I examined the clothing she left after\nSzeth burned the corpse away, I found no spheres or gems.”\nSyl shook her head, looking as troubled as he felt.\n“Storms,” Kaladin said, finally prying his eyes away from the monastery.\n“If that’s what a fully oathed Stoneward can do, it makes me wonder what\nI’m missing about our powers.”\nI don’t think it was that impressive, Nightblood said in his hand.\n“She made the stone flow like water,” Kaladin said.\nWater flows like water all the time, and it’s super stupid. Have you tried\ntalking to it?\n“He has a point,” Syl said to Kaladin. “Water does tend to be pretty\ndumb. Even for something inanimate. No offense, sword.”\nGlad to hear that. Regardless, that sword isn’t so great. I could do better,\nI’m sure.\n“That’s an Honorblade,” Kaladin said. “It grants the bearer the Surges of\na Stoneward—Radiant abilities, unbound by oaths …”"

I’m super good at being a sword.\nBesides, what’s more interesting than making stone act like water?\nDestroying it. That’s what.\n“Szeth did a pretty good job of that too,” Kaladin noted. “Looks like he’s\nfigured out Division at last.”\nNightblood gave a humph.\nTogether, they followed Szeth as he stepped up to the main camp on the\nridge, where people were emerging from their buildings. There were more\nof them than Kaladin had expected—thousands. They must have been\npacked into those barracks. They wore unkempt clothing. Not ripped or\nfrayed, really, but they obviously hadn’t been washed in some time. Stained\nby sweat and crem. Or … well, dirt.\nMany gazed up at the sky, blinking. Several approached Szeth with awe,\nwhispering, pointing at the Honorblade.\n“What are they saying?” Kaladin asked.\n“They’re thanking him,” Syl said. “I think the death of that woman must\nhave freed them somehow. Look how different they seem.”\n“Like they’ve just woken up,” Kaladin agreed.\nMore and more people gathered around Szeth, reaching toward him—\nwhich made him step back, alert, Honorblade clutched as if he expected\nthem to take it. Their postures were universally reverent, but his eyes began\nto dart from side to side. He was feeling boxed in.\nKaladin moved up quickly to intervene, coming in wide so Szeth could\nsee him and not get spooked. “Hey,” Kaladin said. “Hey, you okay?”\n“What do they want of me?” Szeth said. “Why are they acting like this?”\n“Thankful?” Kaladin asked. “You saved them.”\n“I kill,” Szeth said. “I subtract. I destroy. I am to be reviled. I …”\nKaladin carefully put his hand on Szeth’s shoulder and gestured to the\npeople. Nearby, some of them were laughing, clutching family members,\nwhile others had fallen to their knees and were staring at the sky.\n“It’s all right, Szeth,” Kaladin said. “It’s all right.”\nTimid, Szeth relaxed, letting some of the people thank him. Kaladin\ndidn’t understand the words, but he’d seen those postures before, those eyes\nholding back tears. He’d been there. Szeth, it appeared, never had. He took\nthe kindness with an air of bemusement.\nSyl stepped up and translated. “That one in the once-colorful robes\nseems to be their leader. He’s bowing to Szeth.”\n“It’s not right,” Szeth said in Alethi. “This is the Farmer. Son of the man\nI used to know. He doesn’t recognize me, but he is far above me. He … he\nshouldn’t be grateful.”\nStill, Szeth bore it. As he turned to Kaladin and Syl at the end, he wiped\ntears from the corners of his eyes. “I … I do not know how to respond.\nPlease forgive me.”\n“This is what it’s about, Szeth,” Kaladin said.\n“It?”"

Our duty\nhas a cost, as you said—we are both proof of that. But if there’s a difference\nbetween us, it’s this: I know the why.”\n“I thought I knew why,” Szeth whispered.\n“Service to the law?”\n“To an ideal.”\n“Ideals are dead things,” Kaladin said, “unless they have people behind\nthem. Laws exist not for themselves, but for those they serve.”\n“Perhaps,” Szeth said, then took a deep breath and dried his eyes. “Did\nyou see the woman I killed vanish?”\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said. “I thought you did that.”\n“I do not know for certain,” Szeth replied. “This is the first time I have\nbeen allowed Division. I may be … unpracticed with it, since my days\ntraining as a young man. Before she died though, she said something that\nmakes me consider.”\nSyl frowned. “What was it she said?”\n“Just that … my family waited for me.

We need you.\n“I … I believe you,” he whispered back. “There’s something for me\nhere. Not as important as the battle my friends fight in, but still relevant.”\nNo, not as important, the Wind said. More important. Far, far more\nimportant …\n“Kaladin?” Szeth asked. “What are you saying?”\n“I’m talking to the Wind, Szeth. She wants me here.

Every inch of him, save his eyes,\nwas wrapped in tight crimson cloths, the tied-off tails of which sometimes\nescaped his cloak and waved in the wind of an unknown Current. Hand on\nhis kattar, slid into its sheath at his side, he watched for anyone in the crowd\nwho noticed him.\nNothing so far. Good.\nThis was a city haphazardly prepared for war. Baxil strolled through the\nAlethi camp, which had taken the place of the Grand Market. The soldiers\ncamped in concentric rings that he was certain they thought were evenly\nspaced smooth curves. The Azish would have chalked outlines of pathways\nto make sure. He allowed himself a smile, remembering days when he’d\nbeen that persnickety.\nNot a soul saw him.

If you could see that I get what I deserve, I would\nappreciate it. Thanks.\nAzimir was famed for its tea shops, which filled the same niche that\nwinehouses did in the East. By this point, Baxil had sampled a wide variety\nof both, and had his favorites. Here in Azimir, one shop in particular was\nknown for its discretion. They had instructions to watch for him, so as he\nentered, the bouncer by the door leapt to his feet.\n“Master Crimson,” he said. “We got your note.”\n“As well you did,” Baxil said, “or we might not be able to have this\nconversation. He’s here?”\n“He is, master,” the bouncer said, ushering him farther in. “And … he’s\nan odd one.”\n“You don’t know the half of it, Ulak,” Baxil said, tipping him a few\nspheres, which became real as he dropped them. “See that we’re not\ninterrupted.”\nBaxil entered the private room, separated from the rest by hanging\nbeads, and walked through an invisible cloud of incense to approach the\nluxurious table, one of the most exclusive in the city. There, Axies the\nCollector was seated, passing the time by hitting his hand with a small\nhammer.\n“Surely you have painspren by now,” Baxil said, sliding into the booth\nacross from the Aimian. Axies preferred to wear little in the way of\nclothing, in part because he kept his notes on his skin in the form of tattoos\n—an entire book secured in a place where he would never lose it. Like all\nof his kind, he could change the color of any part of his skin at will.\n“I have painspren, yes, of course,” Axies said. “I’ve had them for\nmillennia, Crimson Memory. But you see, we are in the builders’ quarter of\nthe city—where men frequently hammer. There is a curious report from a\nhundred and fifty-two years ago of a peculiar spren drawn to the pain of\nmen who have hit their fingers with a hammer while aiming for a nail. If\none were to search for that specific spren, this would be the place.”\n“And you believe this report?” Baxil asked.\n“Hardly,” Axies said. “It was almost certainly a joke.”\nHe hit his hand with the hammer, then winced, tears leaking from the\ncorners of his eyes.\n“Tell me honestly,” Baxil said, leaning forward. “You enjoy the\npunishment, don’t you.”\n“What kind of deviant would enjoy this?” Axies said. Then hit his thumb\nsquare on with the hammer.\n“Then why?”\n“Pain is fleeting. The thrill of accomplishment is eternal.” Smack. “Yes\n… almost certainly a joke.”\n“If the Prime Kadasix should allow,” Baxil said, relaxing on his bench,\nresting one arm along the top, “I should someday like to understand you.”"

He held his hand out over the tea,\nfeeling the heat of the steam, and … imagined. People throughout the\nteahouse enjoyed their drinks. Especially the stark black jaramon tea, as\nthey’d provided for him. Bitter, sharp, like drinking the venom of\nsomething aggressive—this was tea that fought back.\nSuch things had a life of sorts. Not the individual cups so much as the\nconcept of tea. With this many people thinking about it, savoring it,\ncomplaining about it … Baxil could taste it, and remember what it had been\nlike to drink. During a time that seemed so distant, yet so familiar all at\nonce. Before his blessing, and before his curse.\nToday, a great number of people thinking about the same thing let him\nfeel the bitter tea on his tongue as he sat with his hand over the cup.\n“You’re sure you’re not a spren?” Axies asked. “I’m putting you in the\nappendix regardless, you realize.”\nBaxil smiled. “You brought my bandages?”\nAxies placed them on the tabletop. Red wraps prepared in the most\nspecial of ways, as Baxil needed. The key to his survival. In turn, he placed\na gemstone on the table. He was not a spren, but they did find him\nfascinating.\nAxies snatched it up and peered at the little spren inside. “Better to find\nthem in the wild,” he mumbled, “but this will have to do. Little friend, how\nelusive you’ve proven …”\nBaxil took the bandages and slid them into the pocket of his cloak, then\nrose from his seat.\n“She’s here in Azimir, by the way,” Axies noted.\n“She?”\n“Your old employer,” he said. “The Herald.”\nShalash. He’d known her only as “mistress,” during another life. Had\nbeen rather infatuated with her … maybe never stopped.\n“How?” he asked. “I thought she was at the tower city.”\n“No, she went with the Alethi army on campaign,” Axies said, still\ninspecting his gemstone prize. “I think their king wanted to interview her—\nat least, that’s the impression I got when I chatted with her.

        "text": "ahead.”\n“Yes …” Axies said. “I concur.”\nAxies would stay, of course, hunting the rare spren of enraged passions\nduring war. Well, the Aimian had proven resilient. While Baxil himself …\nalways felt he was one calm breeze away from dissipating. Like smoke\nfrom a dead fire. So, one hand on his kattar, he left a few spheres on the\ntable as payment and continued on his quest.\nHoping that someday, he might be able to enjoy the simple pleasure of\nsipping tea again.\nTaravangian, the god divided, decided to let each side of him rule for a short\ntime in turn. First, the intellect.\nHe found himself more capable, more balanced in this regard as a god.\nHe remembered days of mortality feeling cold indifference to the needs of\npeople—and that terrible callousness now troubled him. Such ruthlessness\nwas not actually logical, for it ignored social consequences. Allowing his\nintellect to reign was not about complete alienation of emotion, but rather\nabout deciding based on reason, while feeling emotion. To that end, he\nlooked at what he was doing, and found …\nThat Cultivation had a point in arguing for him to end the war early—\nthere was good logic in potentially going to Dalinar and the other monarchs,\nthen accepting a deal that restored Alethkar without need for a contest of\nchampions. For one, not pressing the war was safest for Odium personally.\nHe was a new god, and mistakes now could be dangerous, particularly if\nthose powerful forces off-planet decided he was too much of a threat.\nHe had millennia to plan, to decide how to conquer the cosmere as he\nwished. He studied the permutations, his own conclusions, and the goals\nhe’d set out for himself as a mortal, and …\nNo. Working through it in a thousand different ways, he could not justify\nending the war. He was so likely to win, and the offworld forces were\nhighly unlikely to intervene. Plus, there was an element that Cultivation had\nnot been able to fully understand. Odium’s power did not want an end to the\nwar.\nIt wanted to fight, and to rage, and it was livid that his predecessor had\nlet himself get trapped into this contest where the fighting ended. To go\ndown a path of peace had its own terrible danger, especially since there was\nanother being that the power of Odium preferred over Taravangian. Her\nname was Ba-Ado-Mishram, and if Taravangian was not cautious, the\npower might leave him for her, as it had left Rayse for him.\nSo, carefully, he fed emotion to the power. He promised it conquests in\nthe sky, worlds to bend to their will—passion, fury, anger, and pain. All the\nmost powerful emotions that it desired. It fed on that, simmering, while he\nconsidered his plans. They were good. Even excellent. He had a real and\nlegitimate chance at solidifying the entire world beneath his reign.\nAs a test, he showed the power that if it raged too much, it would lose\nwhat it wanted. Extinction of humankind would stop the anger, the rage. He\nshowed it that it would need to learn to fuel itself with more than anger.\nThe power refused to accept that or change. It had given birth to the"

It had given birth to the\nThrill, the grand spren who represented a lust for battle, because it loved the\nemotions of war. It did not accept that too much emotion could ever be a\nbad thing.\nCurious. The power could not change, or would not. Though it should\nhave been all emotions—and his predecessor had insisted that was his\npurview—the power did not like subtle emotions. It liked loud ones. The\npassion of fiery lust, yes. But genuine love? Things such as love and\ncontentment felt like the purview of other gods. They had taken some slices\nof its … portfolio, so to speak, during the Shattering.\nIt liked anger most of all. Anger could simmer when passion gave out.\nAnger could rule a person longer than any lust. Anger was true fire.\nMore information. Good. The more he explored his new capacities, the\nmore he understood. For Taravangian could learn, even if the power\nrefused. He pondered further, with vast resources of mind. His faculties\nwere such that they made his most intelligent days as a mortal seem …\nWell, actually, those had a hint of divinity to them. A respectable level,\nfor a human.\nStill, he was so much more now. Yes, he needed war, for the logical\ndecision was to seek a cosmere unified behind one god. The risks of\nenacting his plans were not too great. He had set up his confrontation with\nDalinar so that he won regardless of what happened. He was confident in\nhis ability to win the vast majority of Roshar.\nHe would be trapped here, but he could keep feeding the power promises\nof the conquest to keep it happy. So how, according to intellect, did he best\nprepare?\nHe needed a command staff.\nPeople of great capacity, and ones he could trust—or rather, ones he\ncould predict so he would know what would cause their failures or\nbetrayals. El, the singer, was a first step. Taravangian had plans for that one\nin coming decades. He needed others. Specifically, those who would live\nlong enough to see his plans enacted.\nTherefore, he appeared at Kharbranth. It was time to speak with Dova.\nRemaining invisible, he first walked the beautiful, dimly lit hallways of\nthe Palanaeum. Books, a weight of information gathered meticulously by\nhis ancestors, each a work of art. This was humankind at its best, standing\nagainst the tides of darkness with ink and pen. He breathed it in, and felt the\nmany words in here. Though minuscule compared to his knowledge, they\nrepresented something grand.\nWas he being too emotional, enjoying this? No, it was logical to admit\nthat he—a god of emotions—needed to feel. Again, it was not rejection of\nemotion that defined intellect, but instead ruling emotion with that intellect.\nSo he slowed time for himself—spending nine thousand heartbeats in the\nspace of a few minutes to bask in the wonderful sense of place a grand\nlibrary provided.\nThat done, he appeared in Dova’s offices on the seventh floor down.\nDova—Battah the Herald—had been an older woman when joining the"

Bald—\nas she enjoyed the way that imitating an ardent made most ignore her—she\nwas writing softly at her desk in a dark room, surrounded by some of the\nmost valuable items in the entire world. Priceless paintings, jeweled vases,\nbars of aluminum.\nHe stepped up, and divinely absorbed the contents of her stacks of\npapers without needing to touch them.\n“While I did intend for you to rule from the shadows, old friend,” he\nsaid, manifesting in a form standing behind her, “I do wish you’d try to let\nmy daughter have a say now and then. She needs to learn to be a queen.”\nDova froze. She spun her chair, and while it was not particularly logical\nto enjoy her look of utter shock, he did it anyway.\n“Hell,” she said. “You’re the new Odium.”\nHe spread his hands to the sides, palms out. “Would you like to worship\nme?”\n“I’d like to be paid, you old rat,” she said, leaning back in her chair,\nfacing him and crossing one ankle over the other knee. “If I’d known how\nmuch trouble it would be to keep your kingdom from falling apart, I’d have\ndemanded so much more.”\n“Dova,” he said, “you’re immortal, and fantastically rich already. Why\ndo you need money?”\n“Do you have any idea the power of compound interest?” she said. “The\nsystem breaks entirely when you can wait it out for a hundred years.”\nTaravangian smiled. She was, for obvious reasons, the most interesting\nmember of the Diagram. Why would a Herald of the Almighty be so …\ncrassly mercenary? The answer proved to be one he’d never exactly\nunderstood when alive. Each of these Heralds was suffering under a cloud\nof mind and soul, and this was how hers manifested. The wise counselor,\nknown for her wisdom for millennia, had become corrupt.\nHe honestly wasn’t certain he could ever name her friend. Dova had no\npermanent allegiances. She was, however, a genuine genius—for a mortal.\nAnd she could be bribed quite effectively. So long as you knew you could\noffer the most, she would always be loyal. What value would it be to have a\nHerald serving him, especially if she returned and went among them? It was\nsomething his predecessor had never tried.\n“I have need of your skill,” Taravangian said. “Specifically, the art with\ncrystal spikes you have been practicing. I believe that you can restore sight\nto the blind?”\n“After a fashion, and with a great cost. They will never truly see again.”\n“But they will sense Investiture?”\n“Yes.” She spun her pen in her fingers. “A god needs nothing, and you\ncould figure out my crystal spikes on your own. You simply want to begin\nintegrating me into your new organization, don’t you?”\n“Why should I reproduce what you have learned so well? It’s more than\njust wanting to make use of you, Dova. It’s that I recognize a valuable tool\nwhen one is presented to me.”"

Even with the Oathpact broken and Ishar doing\nwhatever the hell it is he’s doing, I am a Herald of Honor. Working for\nOdium …” She clicked her tongue. “How unseemly would that be?”\nHe smiled at her.\nShe smiled back.\n“The pay will be excellent?” she asked.\n“Beyond excellent.” He paused for effect. “I can likely get you a planet\neventually. A small one, at least. I’ll try to find a way to get you off Roshar\nto visit it.”\nShe hesitated, her eyes widening, inspecting him to see if he was serious.\nHe was. Today, levity was mostly a social construct to him.\n“I,” Dova said, rising, “will gather my things immediately.”\nNow, it stands to the accountability of reason that orders of\nRadiants, greatly interposed from common nature by their various\noaths, should have had some controversions one to another.\n—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 1\nDalinar felt warm.\nAs if he’d slipped into a bath, a touch warmer than was comfortable at\nfirst, but then his heat blended with it—and it became perfect. Enveloping.\nSafe.\nSo long as he kept his eyes closed.\nWhen he made the mistake of peeking, chaos reigned, trying to tear him\nfrom the warmth. Suddenly he was a child with his grandfather, bringing\nwater to the practice grounds in an old, dusty part of Alethkar.\nIn a flash it was his wedding night with Evi, where he performed\ninadequately in a drunken stupor.\nThen he was the man he’d been just a year ago, getting the report that\nElhokar was dead. A son, sure as his own, lost to the Halls forever.\nCultivation had said he needed to see the past, and so he traveled it—but\nthis was too many versions of himself to contain. So he closed his eyes.\nAnd floated in warmth.\nHe vaguely remembered opening the perpendicularity in Urithiru with\nNavani. Something had … had gone wrong. His anchor had been severed;\nhe’d been pulled in without a way home.\nThat was all right. He’d always been here, and should remain here. What\nwere worries compared to this beautiful sense of peace? Here, nothing at all\nmattered …\nHe peeked.\nHe was walking across a battlefield, bloodied, searching for his brother.\nDragging the corpse of a friend by one hand, because—in his stupor—he\ncouldn’t leave the body behind. Blood trailed him like paint on a\nglyphward, a long stroke, using a once-human brush.\nHe closed his eyes again. Were all those versions of him truly the same\nperson? Or were they paintings made of lying colors on a canvas? Arranged\nto give a sense of continuity, but in reality fractured.\nBetter to float.\nNo. Again he opened his eyes.

I must see.\nIt will destroy you.\nHad he really heard that? Was that … Honor’s power?\nPlease, he repeated, mouthing the word.\nIt will destroy us.\nPlease.\nHe dropped onto something hard. Hesitant, he blinked, opening his eyes\nto find himself kneeling among a few singers. They wore basic clothing:\nloincloths, some straps around their carapace. Their forms didn’t seem\nintimidating; more armored than workform, but not so much as warform.\n“You all right, Moash?” one of them asked.\nMoash? Did they see him as …\nNo, that was just an ancient name that had survived. Navani had\nmentioned reading it in her Dawnchant explorations. With his Connection\nto the Physical Realm severed, he could not return—but had he at least\nmanaged to reach the past?\nThose singers still clustered around him, so he took one of their offered\nhands and let her help him to his feet.\n“Sorry,” he said. “I tripped.”\nThey nodded, and everyone continued on, hiking up through a mountain\npass. As in his other visions, he had taken the place of someone from\nhistory. These would see him as that person, though he saw himself as he\nwas. The vision also made up for his basic failings—for instance, although\nhe did not speak with a singer rhythm, the others didn’t notice.\nHe made a snap decision and tried to reach for his powers and open a\npathway home. It didn’t work. He could access Stormlight—it was all\naround him, infusing everything. But when he tried to Connect the realms,\nslapping his hands together, nothing happened. Hadn’t Wit explained\nsomething about this? Perpendicularities didn’t work the other way.\nStorms. He was trapped in here.\nThe others glanced back at him, so he hastened to catch up. If he acted\nwildly out of character, people in the vision would start getting confused,\nand the whole thing could break down. So he tried to keep pace while …\nWait. How much time had passed?\nWith a mounting horror, he pushed up his wide jacket sleeve to reveal\nhis leather bracer strapped on over his shirt, set with Navani’s fabrials."

How much time had passed?\nWith a mounting horror, he pushed up his wide jacket sleeve to reveal\nhis leather bracer strapped on over his shirt, set with Navani’s fabrials.\nIncluding the clock and day counter. Storms. He’d lost an entire day. That\nwas disturbing, but a part of him was also relieved. The way Wit had\nspoken … it seemed Dalinar could have passed weeks, months, or more\nwithout noticing.\nWell, this clock was tied to Wit’s. Maybe that could provide an anchor to\nget home? He tried using that tether, but again nothing happened. Either he\nwas too inexperienced, or it was too weak a Connection to use to get home.\n“Keep up, Moash!” one of the singers called.\n“Sorry,” he said, puffing as he ran. Was he really that out of shape?\nGranted, some singer forms gave their hosts great endurance, so maybe he\nshouldn’t compare himself.\nThe landscape around them was sparsely forested, and home to a\nparticularly rugged kind of rockbud with a thicker shell and shorter vines\nthan he was accustomed to. Together, he and the singers finally crested the\nrise, and he was relieved to see a flat pass on the other side. The air was\nchill as the group continued forward.\nNine of us, he thought. Where is Navani?\nWas she one of these singers? In the past, when he’d managed to bring\nher into a vision with him, they’d seen each other as they truly were—but\nwho knew if those rules would hold? Before, his experience had been\ncurated by the Stormfather.\nAs they hurried along, Dalinar checked his arm clock again, worried that\nhe’d lose another day somehow. Instead he found the reverse: though he felt\nas if he’d been climbing for an hour or more, mere seconds had passed on\nhis clock. Storms.\nBut how did he get home? He trekked through the pass with the others\nand saw, below, a vast wasteland of crem. A flat brown plain with nothing\ngrowing from it. Where was he? He’d never seen anything like this on\nRoshar. Except …\nIf Wit was right, he thought, this stone has brought me to witness the\narrival of humans on Roshar. Which means that expanse of brown crem …\nthat’s Shinovar, isn’t it?\n“What makes it that way?” he asked out loud.\n“The mud field?” the femalen from earlier asked. “That’s a question for\nthe little gods, not for me, Moash.”\n“There,” another of the team said. “The thieves are trying to skirt the\nbase of the mountains.”\nDalinar followed their gesture, and spotted another group of singers.\nOnly three, leading a group of small chulls along the edge of the mud field\nbelow.\n“Chull rustlers,” he muttered. “All that running to chase down a few\nchull rustlers?”\nThey started descending immediately, taking the slope at a dangerous\nspeed, at least for a human. He fell behind again, and eventually they just\nwent on without him. By the time he reached the base of the slope—puffing\nand sweating—the others had recaptured their chulls.

The large\ncrustaceans rooted around on the ground, searching for rockbuds to chew.\nThey appeared to be juveniles, as they were barely as tall as a person.\n“You all right, Moash?” the femalen asked, trotting up to him.\n“Fine,” he said. “I think I injured my ankle when I fell earlier.”\nHe sat on a rock, sweating. If this vision was like the others, these\nweren’t actual people he was talking to, but … echoes of them. Re-\ncreations. This was like a play, pulled from the mists of time. As he sat, he\ndrew in a little Stormlight—not enough to glow and look odd. His fatigue\nmelted away, and he felt steadier. Yes, everything here was made of\nStormlight.\nHe stood and walked to the edge of the seemingly endless brown plain.\nHe tapped his toe against it, and found it more firm than he’d expected. It\nwasn’t crem though—it felt wrong. Mud? Like the word “muddy,” a\nsynonym for dirty? The ground was said to be strange in Shinovar.\nThe femalen joined him, testing with her toe as well. She hummed\nsomething that sounded curious.\n“Firmer than you thought?” Dalinar guessed.\n“Yes,” she said. “I’ve heard stories of entire hunting parties being\nswallowed by this stuff. It’s not supposed to harden like crem, but I swear\nwe could walk on this.”\n“Maybe it swallows you when you get farther out,” he said.\n“A horrible place,” she said. “Come. We’re going to make camp, prepare\nfor the storm.”\nThe storm? he thought. Damnation.\nSingers could survive out in a highstorm. Technically, humans could too\n—he’d walked some during his time, particularly in his more reckless years\nas a youth. With a little age as seasoning, however, he looked back upon\nthose days with chagrin. So foolhardy.\nPerhaps the storm would be calmer here in Shinovar. The others found a\nstone hollow nearby, and settled down to feed the chulls and prepare a small\ncamp. No metal, Dalinar noted as one of them hobbled the chulls by tying\ntheir feet together with vine ropes. I really am in the deep past, aren’t I?\nSo long as he couldn’t escape, he should try to learn something.\nUnfortunately, it was difficult to concentrate, worried as he was about\nNavani. Was she floating in that chaos somewhere, confronted by flashes of\nher past?\nNavani, he thought. Navani …\nSomething latched on to him, a bond that glowed briefly like a silver\ncord. It yanked on him, and he felt a physical force that made him stumble.\nIt was her. Pulling on him … like he’d pulled on that stone that Wit had\ngiven him. It had been his anchor.

She gripped him, then glanced around.\n“Did we do it?” she asked. “Is this … the past?”\nDalinar led her to the edge of the mud, away from the others. “I think it\nworked, Navani. The stone Wit gave us brought me here, but something is\nwrong. I feel no tether back to the Physical Realm—the clock works, but it\nsays we’ve lost a day already.” He checked his arm with a sudden panic, but\ntime seemed consistent now that he was in a vision. Though another hour\nhad passed in here, the clock said mere minutes had passed in the Physical\nRealm.\n“It could have been worse, I suppose,” she said, turning around.\n“Shinovar?”\n“I believe so. I appeared with this group of singers.” He held up Wit’s\nrock. “This must be the day humans arrive. We’re a little early, I’d guess.”\nHe turned toward the other singers. “Perhaps we can get something useful\nout of them.”\n“Perhaps,” Navani said, her hand still on his arm. “Dalinar, I felt\nsomething when I was floating. A … tugging toward you that I was able to\nsolidify, but there were others. I think there might be someone else in here\nwith us.”\nDalinar rubbed his chin. “Perhaps whatever took us brought Wit as well.\nOr it could be the Stormfather; he exists partially in this place.” He nodded\ntoward the singers again. “I’m going to try something. Might as well use the\ntime we have, right?”\nNavani nodded, following him as he walked to the group of singers.\nThere, he put his hands on his hips and announced, “What do you lot think\nof Honor, the god?”\nBeside him Navani snickered, and when he glanced at her, she’d put her\nhand up in front of her mouth to hide a smile.\n“What?” he demanded.\n“That’s your delicate plan to gather information?”\n“I didn’t say it was delicate.” He eyed her. “Chull in a library?” he said,\nusing one of her metaphors for him.\n“Chull in a storming glassware shop, Dalinar.”\nWell, his question got the attention of the singers. One stood up, a malen\nwith a thick beard, who hummed to a rhythm Dalinar couldn’t pick out.\n“Well?” Dalinar asked.\n“I didn’t realize they’d gotten to you, Moash,” the singer said. “I’m tired\nof this argument.”\nDalinar shared a grin with Navani. Being direct wasn’t always the best\nstrategy, but it was almost always a functional one.\n“Tell me why,” Navani said. “I’d like to hear it from you.”\n“Honor is our god,” the bearded one said, waving in annoyance and\nchanging his rhythm. “His traditions are good enough for me.”\n“The traditions are wrong,” said a femalen, tall and limber, not facing the\nmalen as she worked. “Honor did not give us the spren, or the forms. They\nwere gifts from the Origin of Songs, and They will return. Someday.”"

I think that’s\nreferencing a person.”\n“Adonalsium,” Dalinar guessed, using a name Wit had told him.\n“Adonalsium,” the femalen singer agreed, still working. “Will come\nback for us. Until then, we have the Wind, the Stone, the spren. The life of\ntrees and light of day. That is what we should worship.”\nThe others hummed in what seemed disagreement. When Dalinar\nprodded further, nobody acknowledged his questions.\n“A problem with bluntness,” Navani whispered to him. “Sometimes you\ncut off future opportunities.”\nHe grunted in reply and considered what else to ask, then noticed the sky\ndarkening, clouds billowing forward. He’d forgotten about the storm, but\nthe reports seemed true about Shinovar: instead of a stormwall that tossed\nboulders, he was met with a strong—but not life-threatening—downpour. It\nlasted a mere fifteen or twenty minutes, during which rainspren dotted the\nground like candles. After the initial deluge, the rain softened, becoming\nalmost pleasant.\nThe singers settled onto their knees, then together sang. Each one chose\ntheir own words, but used the same rhythm and notes. Prayers, he realized,\nand suddenly felt that he was intruding. Navani took his hand, and then\nsomething crested the mountaintops—a shimmering distortion that shifted\nraindrops and frightened rockbuds. It had no color or light, but he could see\nit in the way it made the air ripple and the rain tremble. A wave like a\nflowing river, which washed down the slope, trailed by thousands of\nwindspren.\nDalinar stepped in front of Navani by instinct, but the force broke around\nthem, splitting in half—again like a flowing river. It brought with it a\npeaceful sensation and a wind that rippled his wet clothing. The rain’s chill\nfaded to a comforting warmth, and fell into a pattern of sound.\nWe see you, a soft voice, overlapping like a chorus, said in his ear. Man\nfrom another time. Woman from a tower reborn.\n“What … what are you?” Navani asked.\nWe are the Wind, the voices said. Caretakers of this land. And you are\n…?\n“Travelers,” Dalinar said. “Witnesses.”\nCome to see the change, the Wind said. Ah … the arrival.\n“It is soon?” Dalinar asked.\nVery soon. Very soon. The Wind swirled around them. Ah … but you are\nof them. The humans. So you come to know your forefathers …\n“Pardon,” Navani said, “but do you know this … is just a vision?”\nWe have always been, the Wind said. But no thing can remain as it\nalways was. This place is a piece of time, and we see it, experience it. We\nalso see now—and what we have become.

With that, he\ncould get them home.\n“I need to know why Honor’s power abandoned mankind,” Dalinar said\nto the Wind. “I have to access it. Take it up.”\nAt that, the Wind laughed.\n“Do you know how I can persuade it to accept me?”\nIt surrounds you, but you cannot persuade it. Honor’s power is stubborn.\nNow, watch. It is time to see.\nIt flowed past them onto the mudflats. There, in the near distance, a light\nsplit the sky—and a portal opened to another world.\nOne on fire.\nOf different note, as Vava will attest in great disbursement, is that\nwithin orders strife is unexpected, yet still vulgar, of a shape and\nmanifold variety, that is often overlooked, still worthy of\nconsideration.\n—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 1\nShallan floated through shifting colors, transfixed by the beautiful flowing\nribbons.\nLike paint mixing all around her, sometimes becoming images, shapes,\nglimpses of other times. She could have lingered here for an eternity,\nwatching the colors bleed, watching visions of people she’d been come and\ngo.\nThen suddenly it began to fade. She wanted to hold on, reluctant to leave\n—because in that flowing warmth all things were possible, but none of\nthem were her fault. Here, she could merely exist.\nRegardless, a world formed around her. Shallan found herself pulling\nfree of a trance, as if stepping from a mire, and then she began to remember\nurgency. Mraize had collapsed the perpendicularity, and …\n… she’d been sucked through. She felt at her pocket, in the leather armor\nshe still wore, and found the knife she’d stolen from the Ghostbloods. Anti-\nLight. She clutched it, blinking, and looked around, suddenly terrified. How\nlong had she floated like that? Where was she now?\nA room appeared from the shifting mist: a lavish chamber with a\nluxurious bed and fine furnishings. And toys? There was a fortress made of\nwood on the floor, with toy soldiers and several prominent wooden\nShardbearers.\nLight peeked in through open window drapes, but something was wrong\nwith the colors. It didn’t feel quite real. Indeed, when she picked up one of\nthe soldiers from the wooden rampart, she could see that its colors bled into\nthe air. A little like the colors of a prism, but separated, creating three little\ntoy soldiers slightly off-center from one another."

A little like the colors of a prism, but separated, creating three little\ntoy soldiers slightly off-center from one another.\nCyan, magenta, yellow, she thought, remembering her color theory\nlessons. Curious. Though she seemed to be solid, the light coming off every\nother object had that same surreal, off-kilter split of colors. As if they were\non the floor of some Thaylen master printer’s offices, discarded for\nmisalignment.\nThe door opened, revealing Pattern in his full-sized form, with\nTestament behind him—her hand on his shoulder. Like Shallan, they\nappeared more solid than the surroundings. “Ah!” Pattern said. “She is here,\nRenarin! Hmmm. I believe she is playing with your toys.”\n“I was inspecting the colors,” Shallan said, wagging the toy soldier at\nPattern.\n“Oh!” he said. “Can I play with them, then? I always wondered at the\nfuss!”\nAs the others entered from a room outside, Pattern bounced over and\nbegan lining up the toy soldiers. He left Testament to haunt the room just\ninside the doorway, putting her back to the wall. Renarin entered, and\nShallan got her first good view of his spren in physical form.\nTechnically Glys was a mistspren, a variety she’d met in Shadesmar.\nTheir bodies were made of mist that was diaphanous and amorphous, but\nsomehow still gave shape to the clothing they wore. Those she’d seen wore\ngloves, as well as some kind of crystalline mask with delicate features.\nRenarin’s spren had turned a deep red color, like fog hiding a ruby\nsomewhere within. Instead of a mask, Glys had a shifting … nothing. Like\na swirling void, tinted red.\nRlain came in after Renarin, with his own spren, which was larger than\nRenarin’s but had the same kind of face. Rlain towered over all of them; in\nthis form, he might even be taller than Kaladin. He was intimidating in his\nuniform, with his orange-red skullcap of carapace covering his cheeks and\nnose, and with that thick—if short—beard. He had powerful muscles, and\neyes that upon first glance appeared black, without pupils. That was wrong,\nas there was differentiation in singer eyes when you looked closely.\nRlain had presence. She might have been frightened of him, if not for the\nway he glanced at Renarin for support, an action that was strikingly\nvulnerable. Storms. She needed to be careful about how she judged people.\nIt was the artist’s way to paint a picture of someone the moment she saw\nthem—but art was locked to the page, and a person was always so much\nmore than any image could contain.\nPattern began humming contentedly, stacking the toy soldiers up like\nthey were performers.\n“So,” Renarin said. “Um … I think we ended up in the Spiritual Realm.\nFortunately, our spren were able to find you all.”\nShallan winced. “Sorry. I dragged you two into this.” She took a deep\nbreath. “And you were right when you said I was trying to get you to help\nme find Mishram. I didn’t expect … I’m sorry. Genuinely.”"

Genuinely.”\n“It is what it is,” Rlain said, his arms folded. “And if what you say about\nthose assassins is correct—that they are hunting Mishram’s prison—then it\nis well we are here. I don’t want them finding one of our old gods. Odium\nhas enough strength.”\n“I stole this from one of them before the accident,” Shallan said, holding\nup the dagger, the metal at its tip warping the air. “We have to assume Iyatil\nand Mraize are in here somewhere too, and they have spren like yours—\nspren who can guide them.”\n“This Mraize,” Renarin said, “matches the description of someone who\ncaptured Lift during the occupation and gave her to the enemy as a gift.”\nShallan winced. Capturing Lift? Giving her as a gift?\nYeah. That sounded like Mraize.\n“So …” Shallan said, looking up. “We seem to be … in a child’s room?”\n“Renarin’s room!” Pattern said happily. “From when he was young!”\n“I will need memories,” Glys said, standing behind Renarin like a\nshadow. “To give form. I will help, but this is not real. Not even as not real\nas the other visions. Not real past. Sorry. I … will try to words … better.”\n“It’s all right, Glys,” Renarin said. “We get it.”\n“We do?” Shallan asked.\n“Glys can help us shape some semblance of reality from this place,”\nRenarin said. “But it’s not going to tell us anything new or interesting,\nbecause he’s feeding on my memories, not the Connections and tones of the\nSpiritual Realm.”\nOkay … that … barely made any sense to her. Storms. When had\nRenarin learned so much about these kinds of things?\nYou always underestimated him, Radiant reminded her. But at least that’s\none habit you’ve started to break, as you grow.\n“Think of this as a staging area,” Renarin said, gesturing at the walls\nwith shelves bearing toys. “So we can decide what to do next.”\n“Mraize and Iyatil,” Shallan said, “are trying to find the prison of the\nUnmade, Ba-Ado-Mishram. Dalinar will be here too, probably Navani as\nwell, for other reasons.”\nRlain hummed something.\nRenarin, in turn, nodded. “Yes, it is curious. Shallan, do you know why\nmy father would come here? Glys says it’s dangerous.”\n“It is dangerous,” Glys agreed. “And will be.”\n“Dalinar is hunting for information, I think,” Shallan said. “And …\nperhaps for the power of the god Honor, from what I overheard. So that\nmaybe … that power can be exploited.”\nRenarin and Rlain shared a glance.\n“Your father,” Rlain said to a hesitant rhythm, “is an … impressively\nambitious person, Renarin.”\n“Yeah. I’ve noticed.” Renarin made fists and seemed, to her best\nestimation, overwhelmed. She opened her mouth to offer some solution, but"

She opened her mouth to offer some solution, but\nthen he nodded firmly. “Right. If an Unmade’s prison really is in here, we\nneed to find it. First.”\nYou, Radiant noted, are not the only one who has grown.\n“We should join Dalinar and Navani,” Shallan said. “From what Iyatil\nand Mraize said, they hope the Bondsmiths’ visions will lead them to\nMishram’s prison. With your father’s help, we can—”\n“No!” Glys said urgently.\n“No!” Rlain’s spren said, standing close behind him like a shadow. “No,\nno revealing ourselves!”\n“The gods hate us,” Glys said. “In here, we will be exposed to them.\nThey will destroy us!”\n“Honor’s power will hate us,” Rlain’s spren said.\n“We are its enemies,” Glys agreed. “It does not fully think, but it will\nknow. To kill us.”\n“Odium will destroy us.”\n“We are traitors to his vision.”\n“Cultivation will destroy us.”\n“We are abominations,” Glys said. “She will hate us. All will hate us. We\ncannot be seen.”\nBoth of them deliberately stepped further into the shadows of their\nrespective Radiants, peeking out, uncertain.\n“All right …” Shallan said. “So … that makes this more complicated.”\n“There are laws governing what the gods can do,” Renarin said. “Wit\ntalks about it sometimes. But I think … if you enter their domain …”\n“If you invade a person’s house,” Glys said softly, “the law has fewer\nprotections for you. Worse for us. We have chosen to be Enlightened by her,\nwhich puts us in the power of all gods. We will die if we are exposed.”\n“In secret,” Rlain’s spren said. “We go in secret. Using our illusions to\nprotect us. Illusions are quiet. Your enemies, they will come to the same\nconclusions. They will follow the Bondsmiths, who are Connected to events\nthey seek.”\n“So the assassins will be hiding in the visions,” Rlain said, his voice\ndeep and contemplative, “acting out a role, unknown to Dalinar and\nNavani.”\n“We don’t actually have to find Mishram’s prison, you know,” Renarin\nsaid. “We could, um, find these Ghostbloods and just … er …”\n“Just what?” Shallan asked.\n“Murder?” Pattern said, placing another soldier. He’d built a surprisingly\ntall pyramid. “Oh, you mean murder! Shallan is good at murder. Yes,\nmmmmm …”\n“Pattern,” she said, “please don’t say it that way.”\n“She is good,” Pattern corrected himself, “at making people who were\nonce alive and threatening, unalive and unthreatening. Mmmm. Very good\nat it.”\n“Right, um …” Now the old Renarin was back, unwilling to meet her\neyes. “So … if we stop those two, that should be enough, right?

These two not\nonly sided with the enemy, they have attacked—by your word—my cousin\nJasnah. We do what we have to in order to protect.” For support he looked\nto Rlain, who hummed—then after a moment nodded, as if he belatedly\nrealized he needed to give more of a confirmation for humans.\nNeither asked if she was willing. They assumed it, and … well, Mraize\nwas her enemy. He’d manipulated her. Threatened her brothers. He did not\ndeserve her loyalty—and she’d overtly declared war on him.\nStill, she found her heart treasonously hesitant.\nYou’re ready for this, Shallan, Veil thought. We can bring him down.\nYes, but Radiant may have to do the killing, she thought. When the hard\npart comes.\nIt is why I exist, Radiant said.\n“All right,” Renarin said. “Let me see if I can locate Father and Aunt\nNavani. Glys, I’ll need your help.”\nThey settled on the floor, closing their eyes. Shallan hauled herself to her\nfeet and decided to inspect the room. This was Renarin’s childhood\nbedroom, was it? She found a number of stuffed chulls, which appeared to\nhave occasionally been used as mounts for the soldiers—making for the\nslowest, most meandering cavalry of all time. She stopped near Testament,\nwho stood with her hand on one of those animals. Her forlorn pattern\ntwisted, almost motionless.\n“She’s thinking of you,” Pattern said softly, stepping up beside her.\n“When you were young.”\nShallan glanced over her shoulder, to where he’d left a perfect three-\ndimensional pyramid of soldiers—their wooden bases and flat helmets\nletting them balance.\n“She thinks of you,” Pattern continued, laying his hand on Testament’s.\n“And the way you were back then.”\n“Pain,” Testament whispered.\n“In pain,” Pattern said. “A child should live happily. Every child. You\ndid not.”\n“I did for a while,” Shallan whispered.\n“Is that true?” Pattern said.\n“I loved my brothers, and …” Shallan wiped a tear she hadn’t realized\nwas forming. “And there were good times. In the gardens. With her.”\nPattern took Shallan’s hand, then Testament—with a lurch—moved her\nhand on top. Both squeezed.\n“This place,” Pattern warned her, “is affected by your thoughts. Ah, yes,\nand your memories and your soul too. Your soul can make things appear\nwithout thought. It might be difficult. Take care. We will stay close.”\nShe nodded. “I don’t deserve you,” she whispered. “Either of you.”\nPattern hugged her, his too-stiff clothing feeling odd, but she welcomed the\ngesture.\nNearby, Renarin stood up. “We’ve found my father. He’s in a vision.”\n“Good,” Pattern said. “Excellent, even! Let’s go murder some folks!”"

Let’s go murder some folks!”\nWhile Willshapers embraced this very sense of contrarity, an\nattitude that will come as no great surprise to any conversant\nwith their predilections, and indeed might be found unexpected in\nits absence, the presence of such strife among Skybreakers is a\nsource of no small stupefaction to many.\n—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 1\nKaladin, Syl, and Szeth met an unexpected obstacle guarding the next\nmonastery. A fort.\nThey landed together on a grassy hilltop. Kaladin was almost\naccustomed to the ground’s unnatural plushness. Like he was walking on\ncarpet. Outdoors. All the time.\nKaladin shifted the new Honorblade—wrapped in cloth, with a rope tied\nto each end to carry it—from one shoulder to the other. They’d decided\nneither should try to bond it. The distant ramshackle fortification appeared\none strong gust away from collapse. The monastery itself—a towering stone\nblock—peeked up behind the wooden wall.\n“It looks right,” Szeth said. “Good.”\n“Good?” Kaladin asked.\n“No darkness,” Syl agreed. “I can feel it too.”\n“Was there a wall around it before?” Kaladin asked.\nSzeth shook his head. “No, but this is a larger monastery with a small\ncity around it, not just a soldier camp. Perhaps the wall was built after I left.\nAll of the monasteries along the seaboard here were designed to defend\nagainst coastal barbarian incursions.”\n“By barbarians, you mean people like me,” Kaladin said. “Because we\nwalk on stone.”\n“Among other things,” Szeth said, starting forward. “Let’s walk the rest,\nto not alarm them or reveal we are Radiant.”\n“All right,” Kaladin said, joining him. “What, other than walking on\nstone, marks us as barbarians in your eyes?”\n“Your use of color. It doesn’t mean anything to you. Plus, you often eat\nwith your hands.”\n“What else would we eat with?” Kaladin said. “Our feet?”\n“Forks. Spoons.”\n“We have those.”\n“You barely use spoons except for soup. As for forks, you just as often\nuse bread. Flat, dry bread with no yeast. You likely got forks from us.\nPeople in the East steal everything good from the Shin.”\n“Nonsense,” Kaladin said, glancing at Syl for support. She was\nsnickering. “Szeth, that’s nonsense. What have we stolen?”\n“Horses,” he said. “Hogs. Chickens. Social graces. Manners. Philosophy\n…”\n“That’s a huge leap,” Kaladin said. “Horses, maybe. But social graces?\nRegardless, didn’t we all come from Shinovar originally? We landed here\nwhen we … shipped in from another planet? Or whatever.”\nSzeth simply continued walking.\n“Syl,” Kaladin said, “back me up.”\n“Well,” she said, “you do get a lot of food on your hands when you eat.”\n“We use flatbread to scoop curry!” Kaladin said. “We wash our fingers"

You’re not more civilized, Szeth, because you wash\nmore forks.”\nSzeth didn’t reply, but he did seem to have a hint of a smile on his lips as\nthey crossed the shimmering grassland, passing beneath the boughs of a\nlarge tree. After a time flying, Kaladin always forgot how long it took to\nwalk anywhere.\n“You let people rile you,” Szeth said. “You get emotional and argue.”\n“And?” Kaladin asked.\n“And you don’t lose control and kill people.”\n“Is that a problem for you?” Kaladin asked, a little unnerved by needing\nto.\n“No,” Szeth said, “but the Skybreakers teach that if my emotions rule\nme, I will leave corpses in my wake.”\n“You haven’t done so anyway?” Kaladin said.\nSzeth winced visibly. Damnation. Maybe this wasn’t the right way to\napproach therapy, or whatever Wit had called it.\n“I had an old sergeant,” Kaladin said, “in my first months in the military.\nHe always said that he’d rather his men care, feel emotion, and feel pain.\nEven anger. Because we’re supposed to fight for something.”\n“But if you let emotion take over, it will control you,” Szeth said.\n“That’s the way of Odium.”\n“Sure, going too far is clearly bad,” Kaladin said. “I know the stories of\nDalinar’s early days; I’ve met soldiers who were the same. But it’s not like\na little grumping about being called a barbarian is going to drive me to a\nraving frenzy.”\n“And you don’t enjoy it?” Szeth asked. “The battle part?”\n“I …” Did he? “Yeah. Yeah, I enjoy the battle part sometimes.”\n“That doesn’t frighten you?”\n“It does,” Kaladin admitted. “I guess it’s like everything in life. You have\nto find a balance. Is that … maybe part of your problem? You feel that if\nyou take the slightest step in one direction, you might as well dash headlong\nwithout looking back?” He thought a moment. “Might be partially the fault\nof your society, where a child who defends his own life is seen as\nirreconcilably broken—and needs to be sent away.”\nSzeth, characteristically, didn’t respond. But he did appear thoughtful—\nand walking beside him, Syl gave Kaladin an encouraging smile.\nThis was the hard part though. Kaladin had to be honest. Both with Szeth\nand with himself.\nHe had to open up.\n“It still hurts sometimes,” Kaladin said, his eyes forward. “After all I’ve\nbeen through, all I’ve learned, it still hurts. I know I’m still going to have\nbad days, and I’m still going to weep for the friends I lost. I’m still going to\nfeel worthless sometimes. But Szeth, I’m making progress.”\nHe took a deep breath, clearing out some of the emotion.\n“I confronted my shame at being unable to help others,” Kaladin said. “I\nacknowledged I had unrealistic, impossible expectations for myself.

If I can improve, you can too.”\nSyl nodded firmly at this. “I’ve seen it working, Szeth. Not only for\nKaladin, but for others too.” Her words, as a spren, seemed to carry weight\nfor Szeth.\nShe gestured, indicating Kaladin should say more, but his gut said to\nwait. He couldn’t force Szeth down this road. All he could do was share,\nand marvel he was capable of that now.\nEventually, after a good fifteen minutes of walking—passing out of the\nthigh-high grasses and onto a road, then turning toward the small walled\ncity—Szeth spoke.\n“Let us suppose,” he said, “I wanted to … try thinking a different way.\nHow would I approach it?”\n“It sometimes feels like I’ve got two minds,” Kaladin said. “Maybe it’s\nthe same for you. I have a brain that wants to destroy me—one that\nwhispers that everything I love is doomed, so I might as well just give up. I\ncan’t merely endure that kind of thinking. I have to be active. I have to go to\nwar.”\n“Go to war,” Szeth said, “with your own brain.”\n“Yeah, kind of,” Kaladin said. He sighed, searching for the best words.\n“You know how, when you’re first starting to learn to fight, you don’t have\nany instincts? What do you do?”\n“Train,” Szeth said. “Train over and over and over until the proper\nresponse comes the moment you need it.”\n“It’s like that,” Kaladin said. “When the wrong thoughts come in, you\nneed to be ready. Not only to rebuff them, but to present the right thoughts\ninstead. Warrior thoughts, to resist the bad ones.”\n“How can you be sure what is right, though?” Szeth asked. “Your own\nmind has created both ‘good’ thoughts and ‘bad.’ You need something\nexternal, something unchanging—like the law—to guide you. That is what\nmy spren teaches.”\n“Maybe spren can be wrong,” Kaladin said.\nSzeth put his head down, walking faster. “Why do you even care?”\n“I took oaths,” Kaladin said, hurrying to catch up.\n“I took oaths too,” Szeth said with a flippant wave of his fingers. “Mine\nare to the law. Why do yours matter more?”\nThat stopped Kaladin, who paused on the earthen road as Szeth\ncontinued on. It was true. Their oaths—their orders—conflicted. Was there\nsomething higher than an oath? It was difficult to imagine that being true.\n“Szeth,” Kaladin called after him, “how do you feel?”\nSzeth halted on the path, dust on his white trousers. He looked back.\n“How do you feel?” Kaladin asked again.\n“Awful,” Szeth whispered, barely audible. “I should be able to stamp\nthat emotion out, but I can’t. I feel awful. All the time. You?”"

Prepared in your head to counter the dark\nones when they attack? Curious.”\nBefore too much longer, they walked up to the wooden gates of the fort\nto find quite a large group of people had gathered on top to watch them\napproach.\nInterestingly, not all were Shin.\nIt is good for you to hear the words of the Windrunner, Szeth’s spren said in\nhis head. At first, his … inaccurate teachings worried me. Now I see. Like a\nsword being forged, you must be subjected to blows. I will ask the other\nhighspren if they have noticed this important step in the forging of their own\nSkybreakers.\n“You have not done this before?” Szeth whispered.\nYou are my first, and so I will not see you ruined, lest I never be given\nthe chance again. Be careful. You must hear the foolish words of the\nWindrunner and reject them. He is well-meaning, but so very wrong. Hear,\nbut do not heed, my squire.\nSzeth had not known his highspren was new to having a knight; the\nspren did not speak with the air of one inexperienced. And yet, at least part\nof what Kaladin had said was true. Szeth was miserable. Perhaps that didn’t\nmatter. He’d spent his life assuming it didn’t, and it seemed late to change\nthat mindset.\nBut if you had warrior thoughts to destroy such attacks from your own\nmind, he wondered, what then?\nHigh above, on the ramparts—if one could use such a lofty term for the\nflimsy walk inside the palisade—people conferred. Finally someone called\ndown, speaking in the language of Szeth’s homeland.\n“Why are you here, strangers?”\n“We are travelers from beyond the mountains,” Szeth yelled back. “I\nknew this city when it was called Koring, and had no wall such as this.”\nHis comment caused a stir above, and behind him, Syl translated for\nKaladin. He stepped up to Szeth, Honorblade slung across his shoulder.\nNightblood, whom Szeth carried, had said he could persuade the\nHonorblade not to cut the cloth—and so far that was working.\n“Why not tell them who you are?” Kaladin whispered.\n“They didn’t ask,” Szeth said.\n“You’re such a strange person,” Kaladin said, then gestured toward the\nramparts. “Some of those people aren’t Shin.”\n“You can’t tell that by looking,” Szeth said. “They might have lived here\nfor generations. Can you always tell an Alethi by looking?”\n“Well, no,” Kaladin said. “But we’re …”\n“What?” Szeth asked.\n“Cosmopolitan,” Kaladin said. “Everyone knows Alethkar is the center\nof culture.”\n“Tell that to the Azish,” Szeth said, amused.

He gave the people above\nsome time to confer, and was about to breathe in some Stormlight and float\nup, when the gates opened.\nA group of people stood within, bearing metal weapons, though they also\nwore splashes of color. A blue hat here, a yellow apron there. Curious. The\ncity beyond was much as he’d pictured it, however. Wooden boardwalks\nsurrounding maybe two hundred buildings, each painted with color and laid\nout in a neat pattern, with straight roads and plentiful permanent awnings—\nthe type they never had in the East.\nHe’d missed the sight. A simple sign of a land not dominated by storms.\nMetal was used in abundance though—around windows, on door hinges.\nWhen he’d come to his first city, he’d found that blasphemous—even if it\nwas only serviced by soldiers or shamans, and town workers refused to\ntouch it.\nFor Shinovar, this was a midsized settlement, although it would be on\nthe smaller side in the East. His people had less need to huddle together for\nstrength against storms, and so there were far more small towns. At least\nthere had been. Every one that Kaladin and Szeth had passed today had\nbeen empty, like his own homestead.\nSzeth waved to Kaladin and entered, stepping onto the boards that made\nthe street here. Perhaps elsewhere he might have worried about an ambush\n… except these didn’t seem soldiers, but instead merely people with\nweapons.\n“Is that an Alethi uniform?” a man asked Szeth, his voice accented and\nhis white eyebrows long and straight, hanging down by his face. The man\nnodded to Kaladin.\n“It is,” Szeth said, looking around as people gathered. Mothers carrying\nchildren. Workers of all varieties. “What happened here? Why are there so\nmany of you who subtract?”\n“It’s … been a hard few years,” said a woman of Shin heritage.\n“The others leave us alone, mostly,” the first man said. “It was hardest at\nfirst, before the wall. Before we all gathered here, and realized we were the\nonly ones that weren’t …”\n“What?” Szeth asked, fixating on him.\n“Different,” someone else said.\n“Dark,” another added.\nMost of them kept their distance from him, as if expecting immediate\nviolence. Their eyes lingered on the black sword strapped to his back. Or on\nthe Honorblade Kaladin wore, which—despite the cloth around it—was\nobviously a weapon.\n“Did you … really come from the East?” the first man asked. “Is the way\nopen? We’ve considered fleeing. We’ve made a life here, but …”\n“How long?” Szeth asked.\n“Two years.”\nKaladin stepped up, Syl having shrunk to stand on his shoulder and\nwhisper interpretations for him, likely invisible to everyone but him and\nSzeth.\n“Two years?” Kaladin said, and Szeth translated. “Trapped in this city?\nBy what? Attacks from who?”\n“The other towns,” a woman said.\nSzeth scanned the small city. Evidently when danger had come, these"

        "text": "By what? Attacks from who?”\n“The other towns,” a woman said.\nSzeth scanned the small city. Evidently when danger had come, these\npeople had put aside their morals and picked up stone and steel. He found it\n… difficult to blame them. After nine years in the East, he did not deem the\nact as blasphemous as he once might have.\n“Why are things different here?” Kaladin asked.\nSzeth met his eyes, then both of them turned to look toward the fortress\nat the rear of the town. The Willshaper monastery. At the Stoneward\nmonastery, killing the Honorbearer had seemed to release the people. Both\nstarted forward.\n“Wait!” the woman from earlier said. Stout, short, and dark skinned, with\nher brown hair in a bun and a bright green splash of an apron. She also had\na cudgel tied not-so-inconspicuously to her belt. “Who are you?”\n“I am Szeth-son—”\n“I mean, what do you want?” she said. “Do you know why everyone\noutside this immediate region has turned violent? Why they hide during the\ndays, then try to break down our wall at night?”\nOthers began to pester him with questions. The city felt stuffed—home\nto thousands perhaps, if all of those barracks were occupied. They’d\nwelcomed in all the people from the surrounding region, it appeared.\nUnfortunately, he didn’t have time for their questions. He breathed in\nStormlight, rising into the air. Kaladin, with some obvious reluctance,\nfollowed.\nPeople backed away, gasping.\n“The Desolation has finally come,” Szeth told them, “as prophesied by\nthe Heralds themselves. You undoubtedly have seen the new storm. The\nEverstorm.”\n“Yes,” one of the others whispered. “It comes regularly, red with anger,\nand starts lightning fires.”\n“It is a sign,” Szeth said. “The enemy is here, the one we were supposed\nto have trained for centuries to face. We have failed Truth.” He felt his\nstomach twist.\nThousands of years wasted. The gathered people murmured at this—he\nand Kaladin suddenly flying wasn’t much of a surprise, as Honorbearers\nhad once frequented this town, and had not been shy about their abilities.\nBut his words about Truth got to them. They’d known. He could tell by\ntheir reactions, the way they lowered their eyes. They’d guessed that they’d\nfailed.\nHe left the people and flew with Kaladin to the monastery. They found it\nboarded up, planks nailed over all of the arrow-slit windows, and larger\nones across the front gates.\nThey moved to the roof, where Szeth knelt. “I will make us an opening. I\nmust practice with Division.”\n“Please try not to set the entire roof on fire,” Syl said.\n“You have seen only inexperienced Dustbringers so far,” Szeth said,\npressing his hand to the stone rooftop. “Taravangian’s pets had barely any\ntraining. They ignore the ancient honorable traditions and practices of their\nforebearers.”\n“Which are?” Kaladin asked.\n“Self-mastery,” Szeth whispered, “and control.”\nHe summoned the strength of Division.

Szeth’s\nexperience had taught him there was much nuance to the word “powerful.”\nRegardless, he reached back through time to his training, blessing the fact\nthat he’d been forced to learn all the Surges, and closed his eyes.\nThen he felt the soul of the rooftop.\nDivision wasn’t so different from other arts. With Soulcasting, you\nneeded to persuade, cajole, or—if you were particularly skilled—command.\nA Stoneward instead had to know the stone, become kin to it.\nWith Division, the art of Dustbringing, you gave a spark—and controlled\nthe reaction. The results could be explosive. If you were careful, they could\nalso be precise. Today, the fires he started were tiny, practically invisible.\nHe convinced the single-stone rooftop that it was instead made up of many,\nmany stones. Tiny ones. Barely connected.\nHe opened his eyes.\n“Did you … do something?” Kaladin asked.\nIn response, Szeth punched his hand through the rooftop, and a circular\nsection five feet wide disintegrated into powder, raining down into the\nblackened chamber below. Szeth slipped through and dropped into the great\nhall of this monastery, gemstones glowing in the walls to give light.\nNo shaman or Honorbearer waited to attack him. Instead he spotted\nsomething at the front of the hall, near the wooden altar where a stone—\nbrought up from the depths of the soil, hosting the spirits of spren—was\ntraditionally placed.\nCurled in front of it was a corpse. Desiccated by time, holding the\nWillshaper Honorblade: a wide, flat-sided Shardblade with a curved bell\nshape at the tip.\nThe corpse belonged to Sivi-daughter-Sivi, a woman he had once known\nvery well. Szeth knelt beside her and sighed softly. Sivi’s wisdom would\nhave been welcome today.\n“What’s this?” Kaladin said, peering at the ground near her. “These\nmarkings on the stone?”\n“Writing?” Syl said, still small sized, waving for him to hold the light\ncloser. She scrunched up her nose. “I don’t read Shin that well …”\n“It says,” Szeth whispered, “‘I will not bow to him.’” He lowered his\nhead in respect for Sivi. This was what honor looked like sometimes: a\nwithered husk dead on the floor.\n“So …” Kaladin said. “In the previous monastery, the people were\ncursed until you killed the bearer of the Honorblade. Here we find a corpse,\nwho said she would not bow. And the people here aren’t cursed.”\n“So …” Syl said. “This Honorbearer refused whatever the Unmade\nwanted from her, and died instead.”\n“Bring the Honorblade,” Szeth said to Kaladin and Syl, then stood up\nand started walking to the end of the hall.\nWhat are you planning, Szeth? his spren asked.\nIn response, he placed both hands against the gates into the monastery.\nHe closed his eyes, feeling the weight of the doors, which saw themselves\nas part of the monastery.

He severed that, and burned the sides so that when\nhe opened his eyes and pushed, the gates collapsed forward—thundering to\nthe ground outside, tearing down the flimsy boards.\nThe people had gathered outside. Szeth rose into the air, barely noting\nthat Kaladin and Syl had joined him. As the people approached, he spoke.\n“I am Szeth-son-Neturo,” he proclaimed. “Once Honorbearer, now\nKnight Radiant. I was exiled as Truthless, but by suffering in the East, only\nI maintained Truth. The Desolation is here; the outside world has been\nfighting it for over a year.\n“We have failed in our long-standing duty, but I will not fail you. Look\nto the people of the Encilo region—those near the Stoneward monastery.\nThey are freed from the darkness now. I will travel to each monastery in\nturn. If they are similarly corrupted, I will fight the Honorbearer there and\nrestore the people.”\nThe people mostly gaped at him. A few clapped—flimsy, hesitant\nsounds. Well, he didn’t blame them for their confusion. One might imagine\nthat salvation would arrive to thunderous joy, but in his experience it was\noften rewarded with exhaustion. Those who needed help most rarely had\nmuch left to offer their rescuers.\n“You can help them, Szeth,” Kaladin said, hovering up beside him in the\nair. “But trust me: you’ll do more good if you take care of yourself as well.”\n“I will ponder what you have said,” Szeth said. “But we must get to the\nother monasteries. We can gather Stormlight from the hall behind us, then\nvisit the Elsecaller and Lightweaver monasteries tomorrow.”\n“We could split up,” Kaladin said. “Visit two at once. If you have to do\nthe fighting, I could see if any of the others are lacking combatants like this\none. Might speed us up.”\n“I will not stop you, should you wish to go.”\n“And what do you want me to do, Szeth?”\n“I …” He surveyed the crowd, which was at last beginning to celebrate,\npeople hugging one another. “I feel better than I did. I must attribute some\nof that to your annoying persistence.”\n“Well,” Kaladin said, “with that kind of glowing praise, how could I\nleave?”\nSzeth nodded. “As we travel, I will tell you some of what I know of the\nleaders of the monasteries. It might be relevant. Both to our quest … and to\nme. Who I am.”\nWere they all turned to the Unmade? How had Ishu let it go this far? The\nanswer, Szeth supposed, was simple: The Heralds had all gone mad, and\nignored the people they’d once sworn to protect. Much as the Shin people\nthemselves had ignored their duty.\nSzeth went to fetch Stormlight. When he came back, Kaladin had\ndropped down and—with Syl helping interpret—begun trading for fresh\nfood. These people looked well fed enough to spare some—there was time\nfor farming in the day, judging by the state of the nearby fields."

What if the actions of the\nHonorbearers you’re killing are just?\n“I have considered this, spren-nimi,” Szeth said. “The rest of Roshar\nbelonged to the singers before we arrived, and it makes sense that now,\nsinger laws apply there. By virtue of precedent, this is justice. Here,\nhowever, we are in Shinovar. By the ancient histories, Shinovar was given\nto us.\n“Singer law does not apply here; instead, the law of this land is the law\nof the Heralds. They provided this ultimatum: prepare for the Desolation\nand protect this land when it comes. So that is what I must do.”\nA … compelling argument, Szeth, the spren admitted. Yet you do not have\nall of the facts, so take care.\n“Will you give them to me?”\nThey must be earned. Continue your pilgrimage.\nAt this, the whispers from the shadows sounded louder. Calling for Szeth\nto die.\nHe met them, and the words of the spren, with a thought soldier. I have a\npurpose, that thought soldier proclaimed. I am here because of my choices,\nand I am capable of making such decisions.\nIt didn’t work as well as he’d hoped. But Kaladin had said it would\nrequire time and repetition. With that in mind, even this little rebellion\nseemed to help, and Szeth raised his head higher. He could do this. He\ncould decide. Which meant the end was finally in sight.\nHe could cleanse Shinovar.\nThen, at long last, he could end himself—and in so doing, grant true\njustice to those he had murdered. Quietly, he blessed Kaladin for giving him\nthis gift.\nIndeed, the presence of a Herald among them should have, to all\nreasonable understandings, and to the abridgment of expectation,\nled to stability of doctrine among this most specific of orders.\n—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 1\nA portal from another world.\nShalash the Herald had mentioned this, as had Wit.

He strained to hold the way open as\nthousands of refugees flooded around him, clutching their meager\npossessions. Leading withered animals—many of which were unfamiliar to\nNavani.\nIn the background, their world burned. The very sky seemed to be on\nfire, and the people were covered in ash and soot. Navani felt a sudden need\nto go comfort them.\nDalinar gently held her back. “It’s just a vision, Navani,” he whispered.\n“There is nothing you can do for the actual people—they are long dead.\nSave ten. Or nine, I suppose, as Jezrien has been destroyed.”\nAnother figure approached the portal from the other side, stumbling,\ndressed in odd white robes—now stained black—hanging from one\nshoulder.\n“Correction,” Navani said. “There are ten who were here who still live,\nDalinar. That’s Wit.” He didn’t look a day younger than he did thousands of\nyears later, though his hair was a stark white, and he appeared shorter for\nsome reason.\nThe singers standing near Navani and Dalinar had abandoned their\nprayers, and were now muttering to themselves. One femalen mumbled,\n“Such strange skin patterns …”\nNavani hesitated. That singer seemed familiar.\nDalinar, however, started forward. Navani rushed after him, and the\nother singers called after them both—then fled, leaving their chulls,\nobviously terrified by the strange events. As well they should have been.\nToday marked the first step toward what would become a millennia-long\nwar.\n“Dalinar,” Navani said as they walked across the muddy field, “we need\nto find answers.”\n“Agreed,” he said. “We must either find a way home, or …”\n“Or?”\n“We came here to find why Honor’s power refuses to bond anyone,” he\nsaid. “Cultivation implied the secret lies in understanding the history of our\npeople, the Heralds, and their relationship with God.” He hesitated. “That\npower should be a way out for us, if I do take it up.”\n“We will … search for a way,” Navani said, daunted by the idea. “And\nwhile we’re here … there are other secrets we can uncover. Some things\nabout the Heralds’ stories have always confused me.” She glanced at the\nportal—which had expanded to thirty feet in diameter. Ishar stood in the\ncenter, hands thrust to the sides, his face a mask of concentration as he let\nthousands escape the burning land. They wore a variety of clothing styles\nand were of many ethnicities. They must have gathered together at the end,\nseeking refuge from the fires.\n“We know from previous research,” she continued, “that at this point, the\nHeralds aren’t Heralds yet. They won’t become Heralds until the war with\nthe singers begins, and that is at least a generation or two later. Radiants are\nmultiple millennia away from being founded. So how are they accessing\nthese Surges? How did they cross this divide between worlds?”\n“That’s … a good question,” Dalinar said, frowning. “The Stormfather\ntold me that Honor worried about these powers—he feared the Radiants"

How did they cross this divide between worlds?”\n“That’s … a good question,” Dalinar said, frowning. “The Stormfather\ntold me that Honor worried about these powers—he feared the Radiants\nmight destroy Roshar. I think … people must once have been able to access\npowers without bonds and oaths holding them back.”\n“No checks against their power,” Navani said, staring through the tunnel\nat that horrifying place of smoke and red skies. “Come, let’s see what we\ncan discover.”\nShe started forward again, but soon found crossing the muddy ground to\nbe difficult—it was wet from the rain that was still sprinkling down. This\nproved a struggle for the refugees as well, who were laden with goods or\ncarried them on the backs of sorry-looking horses or stranger beasts of\nburden.\nNo wagons, she thought. Or carts. She had trouble believing none had\nmanaged to get a vehicle to help. They must come from a time before such\nthings were invented.\nStorms, it was strange to think of a time that long ago. As she drew\ncloser, she could see the people were as human as any she’d known. Their\nagony seemed real, as did their tears of exhaustion—and even joy—as they\nentered the rain and collapsed in the mud, unable to go any further.\nStrangely, they didn’t attract spren—perhaps those weren’t used to humans\nyet.\nThe rain let up, but her every footstep slid in the muck, and her skirt was\nquickly ruined. Dalinar fared better, stomping his way on booted feet. “Poor\npeople,” he whispered. “Maybe we should get one of those chulls to help?”\n“I thought the people weren’t real?” Navani said.\n“They aren’t,” he admitted. “I … well, I’ve never been good at paying\nattention to that, reasonable though it is.”\nShe smiled, accepting his help forging forward until they reached the\nfirst refugees. The awful stench of smoke hung over them, and they shied\naway. She belatedly remembered that they would see her as a singer—a\nfrightening creature with marbled skin and carapace.\nOne man in a blue tunic had been directing people toward the slopes. He\nstrode over, sandaled feet sliding in the mud, using a spear with an obsidian\nhead to balance himself. He had a short black beard and keen eyes, and\ncould have been Alethi, by his features. Storms. She thought she recognized\nhim. Could some of the depictions have been that accurate?\n“Jezerezeh?” she said, then remembered the name Ash and Taln had used\nfor him. His real name, before being mythologized and made symmetrical.\n“Jezrien?”\nHe pulled up short, his eyes widening, and barked something at them in\na tongue she didn’t recognize.\nDalinar stared at the man, breathing in sharply.\n“You recognize him too?” she asked.\n“In more ways than one. I saw him in a vision, but now that he’s here in\nmore common clothing, exhausted … Storms, Navani. That’s Ahu, a\nbeggar. I … I used to drink with him sometimes, in the gardens at Kholinar\n…”\nWhat? “You’re kidding.”"

A kindly drunk who\nshared wine with me during some of the dark days … Is it possible? Truly?”\nShe turned her attention back to Jezrien. He made another demand of\nthem, and a woman with brilliant red hair—with some undercurrents of\ngold in the locks beneath—stepped up beside him. She had the air of a\nwarrior, though she carried a simple stone axe. That would be Chanaranach,\nsometimes referred to as Chana by Ash.\nAt Navani’s urging, Dalinar retreated with her a little way, so as to not\nantagonize Jezrien or Chana. “Three Heralds,” Dalinar whispered. “You\nsaid the Heralds don’t get their powers for several generations.”\n“Raboniel was made immortal near the time that the Oathpact was\nfounded, which she said was around two generations from the crossing.\nThat matches what we know from the writings in the Dawnchant. They\nindicate that at first, men and singers got along—but over time, humans\nwanted to expand. Rebellion followed, then war …”\n“That explains why Ishar looks younger than when I met him,” Dalinar\nsaid. “And Jezrien here, he could be in his late twenties maybe? And …\nthere.” He pointed toward a young teenage girl, protected by a small group\nof spearmen. “Ash.”\n“And the Ash we know seems frozen in age in her late twenties,” Navani\nsaid. “The Heralds must have aged slowly somehow, until they were made\nimmortal some sixty or seventy years from now. I’d like to see that day.”\nShe narrowed her eyes. “Where is Odium? He arrived with the humans.\nThough a god may not make himself visible …”\nNavani glanced back. Distantly, singers had stopped upon the\nmountainside. They had wisely realized they should see what these invaders\nwere doing.\nJezrien stepped closer, and made yet another demand.\n“Always before,” Dalinar said, with a frown, “I was able to understand\npeople’s languages in the visions.”\n“Everyone’s language?” Navani said. “I think we imprinted as singers in\nthis one, so we speak their language.”\n“I’ll have to try my Connection trick,” Dalinar said. “Which requires\ntouching him.” He raised a finger and wisps of Light began to stream off it.\nJezrien growled, and a powerful Light began to stream from him as well.\nStorms.\nYes, that’s what destroyed Ashyn, Navani thought, remembering the first\npiece of Dawnchant they’d translated. Dangerous powers, of spren and\nSurges. They destroyed their lands and have come to us begging.

But for the moment, her attention was best\nfocused on her husband—because he had stepped forward again and was\npicking a fight with an ancient king. Dalinar was trying to explain—without\nwords—that all he wanted to do was touch Jezrien.\nUnfortunately, if they were familiar with Surgebinding, they knew the\ndangers a simple touch could offer. She didn’t blame Jezrien for backing\naway, pointing a spear toward Dalinar. He had been immune to danger in\nhis previous visions, but now they were here in the flesh. The rules might be\ndifferent. Regardless, she didn’t want Dalinar starting a storming fight in\nthe mud. However, she saw a solution. She touched him on the arm and\npointed to Wit, who had finally stepped through the portal.\nHe was staring at the sky while holding a small rock. The same one he’d\ngiven Dalinar—or would give Dalinar, thousands of years in the future. Wit\nspotted them, and Navani hoped he’d intervene. Instead he looked away, his\nshoulders slumped.\n“Maybe the Wit of this time can explain what we need to Jezrien,”\nNavani said. “Or maybe he’ll let you touch him.”\nDalinar and Navani hiked that way. The mud wasn’t terribly deep, but it\nwas still difficult to move in. Nearby, one poor animal—thicker than a horse\nand heavy as a chull—was getting mired in a deeper spot.\nDalinar grabbed Wit by the shoulder, then touched Navani, Connecting\nthem to make their languages match his—a trick she hadn’t had time to\nlearn yet. Wit appeared profoundly haunted. Eyes glazed over. Motions\nsluggish. Well, he’d just seen an entire world fall. She supposed she\ncouldn’t fault him for lacking a chipper attitude.\nWhen he spoke, though, it wasn’t what she had been expecting at all.\n“I’m not real, am I?” he said in a monotone.\n“Wit?” Dalinar said. “Um … what is your other name?”\n“I have many,” Wit said. “None of them are me. I’m … power … trying\nto imitate him … But he knows too much, so he would know he’s not real,\nand so I have to make myself know I’m not real … But then … I know …”\nHe put his hand to his head, his eyes bulging, and his face started to\ndistort. Melting like paint on a wall. Navani jumped backward.\n“Wit,” Dalinar said. “Whatever you are. Wit would help us.”\n“He just watched Ashyn die,” the homunculus said. “It was one of his\nfirst great failures. Not his absolute first … but one of them. He spent the\nnext weeks staring at the sky. Worrying that he was too old, at three\nthousand. That he was losing himself.” The thing stumbled away. “I must\ndo that. I must do that …”\n“I don’t think we’re going to get anything useful from him,” Navani\nsaid. “But we at least learned the language.”\n“I don’t think we did,” Dalinar said. “I tried to Connect to him, but he"

It wasn’t as refined as\nMaya’s Blade, but it got the job done, crunching carapace and sending the\nenemy to the ground screaming.\nHe knew he was killing good people who were fighting for a world\nwhere humans could never enslave them again. Fortunately, Adolin hated\nthis part already. So he did his job, holding steady with Neziham—the\nAzish Shardbearer—at the center of the human lines.\nThis was the eleventh wave of enemies since the initial fight the day\nbefore. The singer strategy now was to leverage their superior numbers to\nwear down the defenders. Like the previous assaults, this one involved\nenemies flooding out of the central building, advancing through volleys of\narrows, and engaging the pikes.\nTheir battle-by-battle tactics varied. This time they’d sent the entire\nflood at one section of defenders. That let them concentrate their forces—\nbut it let the humans do the same, positioning both Shardbearers right at the\ncrux of the defense. Adolin felt tiredness deep in his bones, but he kept\nfighting, counteracting fatigue with determination. He kicked a table into\nsome singers, who finally began withdrawing toward their bunker.\nAdolin held up a fist, and a horn sounded in response: Kushkam\nagreeing to an advance. So far, the human forces had stood their ground,\nmaintaining that massive ring of pikes and shields, rotating men in and out.\nIn response, the enemy had started building. Using pieces of wood from\ndisassembled ships, they’d started to expand their presence in the dome,\nerecting a kind of roofed fort—maybe a hundred feet in diameter—around\nthe central control structure.\nPlainly, giving the enemy a larger staging area in the dome was no\nlonger a good idea.

        "text": "singers back through the portal to reset. Supported by two full companies of\nsoldiers, Adolin pressed forward. Though the ground was now strewn with\ndebris per his suggestion, the latest singer advance had pushed a great deal\nof it out of the way, clearing a path for a counterassault.\nSingers retreated in front of Adolin, and arrows rained down on them\nfrom above. Seeing the two Shardbearers giving chase made the enemy\neven more unnerved, and some broke. Running, their backs exposed,\nmaking life here for the singers like Damnation itself. At least during their\nadvances they had shield cover to stop arrows.\nAdolin and Neziham surged forward, crossing the fifty or so yards with\ntroops marching behind. The enemy crowded into their newly made fortress\n—which was less like a palisade and more like a little dome of its own.\nOnce close enough, though, Adolin gave the order and the human advance\nhalted. Azish hurlers came forward and tossed bags of oil an impressive\ndistance to hit the fortification.\nSetting the entire inside of this place on fire was a bad idea—but Adolin\nwasn’t opposed to a little tactical arson. The enemy wanted to build a\nfortress in here? Well, flaming arrows would have something to say about\nthat. The oil caught in a burst, and they watched as it burned. Then faltered.\nThen sputtered out.\nWhat?\n“Storms,” Neziham said from within his helm. “Adolin, I don’t think\nthat’s wood—not anymore.”\nJoined by shockspren, Adolin realized he was right. Some sections of the\nfortress had burned away, but much of it … well, what they’d mistaken at a\ndistance for wood was instead a dark brown, unpolished bronze. The enemy\nhad put their stolen Soulcaster to use. Likely setting up sections of wood,\nsealing them with something malleable—as sickening as it sounded,\nprobably feces—then Soulcasting it to solidify the entire structure. Adolin\ngave an order to charge forward, hoping maybe his hammer and Neziham’s\nBlade could destroy the fortification.\nHowever, as soon as they drew close, sections of the fortification slid\nopen—and stormforms began sending out waves of lightning to electrocute\ntroops. Singer archers shot in tandem, and as the human advance faltered,\nreservist rank-and-file singers rushed out to reset their position.\nAdolin’s soldiers had to slow, then hunker down, and then Adolin\ncouldn’t press forward lest he get surrounded. He waited, blocking with his\nown body what he could, but he soon realized this was futile. He couldn’t\npress inward. Their protection of this city depended on them being the\ndefenders, inflicting large casualties on the enemy. He’d lose far too many\ntroops rushing a fortification.\nHe roared in his Plate and smashed a group of singers out of the way,\nthen called the retreat. His forces made a controlled withdrawal, with him\nand Neziham at the rear to block as many enemy arrows as possible, until\nthey eventually reached the human lines. Here he met Kushkam. The stout\nman’s armor was bloodied, though Azish generals didn’t often fight at the\nfront. He eyed Adolin and Neziham, then nodded to the side, and the three"

He eyed Adolin and Neziham, then nodded to the side, and the three\nof them stepped away from the others to confer in private.\n“Bronze,” Adolin said, pulling off his helmet. “They’ve Soulcast the\nstorming thing to bronze.”\n“This is my fault,” Kushkam said. “I let that Soulcaster be taken …”\n“It was a difficult assault anyway, Commandant,” Neziham said, pulling\noff his own helm, revealing a shaved head and a mouth with several bronze\nteeth. “Even without the Soulcaster, the wood might not have caught fire—\nnot if they know to wax it.” He looked across the expansive floor of the\ndome, now with a little fortress at the center. “We’re going to have to let\nthem keep it until reinforcements arrive. We can’t expend the lives to take\nit.”\n“By Yaezir himself,” Kushkam muttered. “Suggestions?”\nAdolin tapped his finger against his helm in thought. “Do you have\nanything bigger than a bow or an ordinary crossbow? In Alethkar, we use\nenormous crossbows—small ballistas really—to try to bring down\nShardbearers.”\n“That works?” Kushkam asked with a grunt.\n“Not usually,” Adolin admitted. “My father does like talking about how\nmany he destroyed in his youth. But we might be able to use them to break\nthat fortress.”\n“We don’t have anything like that, Adolin,” Neziham said.\n“Siege equipment?” Adolin asked. “Catapults?”\n“No. The capital hasn’t been assaulted in centuries. Not since the Alethi\ninvasions, in fact.”\nAt home, they’d have engineers who could build them, but certainly not\nfast enough to be relevant on this battlefield. Adolin considered, but storms,\nhis mind was sluggish.\n“Maybe try to get some rocks on the roof?” Adolin said. “Drop them\nthrough the skylights to see how structurally sound that inner building is?”\n“An excellent suggestion,” Kushkam said, and walked away, calling out\norders immediately.\nAdolin grunted, then took a drink from a runner girl. Fourth day, he\nthought. Only two more until the army starts to arrive. So far, they’d lost\none for every five of the enemy, but if their lines grew too thin …\nWe’ll hold, he thought to himself, and felt a wave of support from the\nnow-distant Maya.\nAdolin nodded to Neziham, then jogged to the way out. There, he moved\nthrough the short maze—really just three small hallways turning sharply—\nand emerged into the late afternoon light. Here …\nHere Adolin sagged, sudden fatigue hitting him like a stormwall,\nexhaustionspren buzzing around him. This had been his third time in the\ndome—and the most grueling. Still, he forced his limbs to move, lugging\nwhat now seemed leaden Plate as he stomped over to his waiting attendants.\nHe stretched out his arms to let his armorers start removing his Plate.\n“Kaminah,” he said to his young aide-de-camp, “what does it mean to\ncapture the city?”\n“Sir?” the brown-haired young woman replied. “Um … I mean, you"

Odium gets the entirety of Azir if he captures this city … but\nwhat does capturing it mean, exactly?”\n“I have no idea,” she said. “Do you want me to write asking for\nclarification from Urithiru?”\n“Please do. It might not be relevant. If they break out of that dome, it\nwill be pretty obvious when the place is conquered, but I’d rather not be\nsurprised by some little-known legality.”\nShe bobbed her head eagerly.\nHis breastplate unlocked and his armorers hauled it free, abruptly\nburdened by its weight—which could be cumbersome when it wasn’t\npowered and active. He stepped free of his boots, and suddenly felt like a\nman whose saddle girth had been cut, dumping him to the ground. He\nstumbled, and needed Colot—who appeared from nowhere and helped him\n—to stay upright. Adolin thanked him and wiped his brow, regaining his\nbalance.\n“You need rest,” Colot said.\n“Sure do. Ask around and see if any of our soldiers did carpentry work,\nand if they built siege equipment at any point. Also, don’t we have a scribe\nwith some engineering knowledge? It might be worth seeing if we can get\nsome catapults up.”\n“Not sure we have the time,” Colot said.\n“Try anyway,” Adolin said.\nThat staging fortress at the center of the dome was going to let the\nenemy keep a large number of troops in position. And with the Soulcaster,\nthey could constantly reinforce it … maybe expand it …\nOne day in, and his defenders were already strained. “Colot,” he said,\n“bring in my first armor standby and tell him to be ready for battle.”\n“Moore? He’s sleeping off the last attack, Adolin,” Colot said, with a\nchuckle. “We’re on your second standby. Reep.”\nAdolin nodded. He knew Reep; a fine soldier, and well trained in Plate.\nHe would take this shift, wearing Adolin’s armor for the next four hours and\nfacing any enemy assaults. Strangely, though, Adolin thought he felt\nreluctance from the armor as it was carried away. Was that real?\n“Hold,” he said to the armorers, and then reached out a hand to touch the\nbreastplate.\nYeah, he was imagining things. He sensed nothing special or odd from\nthe touch. Still, he’d spent his life talking to his sword, and eventually it had\ntalked back.\n“Go with them,” he whispered. “Serve those who bear you as you have\nme. Protect them.”\nHe gestured to the armorers, who—looking amused—carted it off. Well,\nanyone who had served with him long enough knew his ways. He talked to\nhis horse too. And anyone who thought that was strange could stuff a chull\nup their backside; Gallant understood the conversation, and enjoyed it.\n“Casualties?” Adolin asked.\nColot steeled himself. “Twenty-one of ours dead, plus three times as"

I don’t have the Azish number.”\nA costly failure for his assault. In that moment, the celebrations of a day\nago felt far distant. “Get me the names. I’ll listen to them after I check on\nmy horse.”\n“Sir,” Kaminah said, stepping in front of him, her sleeved safehand\nacross her ledgers, holding them tight against her chest. “Um …”\nColot nodded to her, and some understanding seemed to pass between\nthem. Had they been conferring?\n“You should go and rest,” she said to Adolin. “Um. Please?”\n“No need to ask,” Colot told her. “You’re his aide-de-camp, promoted at\nhis own word. You can just tell him.”\n“Right, right,” she said. “Um … yeah. Go and sleep!”\nAdolin sighed softly, then gave Colot what he hoped was a properly\nwithering stare. “You’re making her do it?”\n“What?” Colot said. “Are you really going to ignore Brightness\nKaminah? On the first full day, you’re going to stop her from doing her job?\nThe one you asked her to do?”\nAdolin glanced at the young woman, who shrank down a little, but she\npointed with her freehand at the exhaustionspren buzzing around him. “To\nbed. You fought all night, straight through the Everstorm as it passed.\nBrightlord Colot says I’m supposed to tell you that you have to sleep.”\n“Or?” Colot asked.\n“Or,” she squeaked, “the sergeant at arms will, um, find you and … well,\nthey say he’ll tie you in place.”\n“You know how excited Grubs gets when he has a chance to dig out his\nofficer-tying rope,” Colot added.\nAdolin sighed again.\n“Her first day,” Colot reminded. “Surely you want to be a good example,\nso that in the future she’ll have the courage and experience to help your\nother officers get the rest they need. Even if, of course, you’re superhuman\nand could keep going for weeks.”\n“You’re a bastard, Colot,” Adolin said, but smiled and raised his arm.\nColot tapped it with his own, forearm to forearm. A promise made, and a\npromise accepted.\n“I do my best, sir,” Colot said. “You know I’ll wake you if necessary.”\nAdolin nodded, then paused. “When did you last sleep?”\n“Um …” Colot said.\n“Oh!” Kaminah said. “You too! Off to bed!”\n“After his sleep shift,” Colot promised.\n“Make sure he does it, Kaminah,” Adolin ordered. Then trudged off—\nsecretly relieved they’d forced him into it.\nAfter spending a day preparing strategy and organizing the Windrunners to\nfly the Mink to Herdaz, Sigzil finally stepped out of the Oathgate at the\nShattered Plains.

        "text": "Shattered Plains. Here, he officially took command of the united coalition\nforces defending Narak.\nWith a plan in mind.\nHe immediately launched into the sky, hovering above the Shattered\nPlains to see what the maps had depicted. “Narak” was the name given to\nthe central plateaus, the heart of where the listeners had once made their\nhome in exile. The military, ever pragmatic, had named the largest of those\nplateaus—one shaped a little like a half-moon, open side to the west—\nNarak Prime. The smaller satellite plateaus around it were named Narak\nTwo, Narak Three, and so forth. Of those, Narak Two—the plateau he’d just\nleft—was of vital importance, as it held the Oathgate.\n“Thoughts?” he asked, hanging there.\n“It’s as you feared,” Vienta said, appearing to him as a small woman\nshrouded in moving, flowing cloth, nothing but her eyes visible. “I see\ntroop placements on only the two central plateaus.”\n“Not a bad move,” he said. “Supporting our most important locations.”\n“Yes, but you’ve persuaded me. There is a better defense to be had.”\nSigzil nodded to himself, feeling confident for the first time in months.\nKaladin trusted him. Dalinar trusted him.\nHe, in turn, would trust that they were right to put him in command.\n“Time until the Everstorm arrives?” he asked, gazing to the west—where a\ndarkness was looming.\nVienta watched for a moment. “At current speed,” she said, “I estimate\nthree hours.”\nShe didn’t like letting others know how good she was with things like\ncalculations. It embarrassed her; apparently other honorspren had teased her\nfor her numerical mind. Sigzil instead found it brilliant. She could run\nmathematical problems in her mind faster than a scribe with an abacus, and\ncould judge things like distance and momentum with a glance.\n“Thank you,” he said. “Let’s grab the others and get a little closer to the\nstorm, see if we can make out Fused. I’d love for you to do whatever counts\nyou can of them with that exceptional mind of yours.”\nShe fuzzed, blurring—something she did when she was pleased. “I love\nthat you appreciate what I can do,” she whispered, “even if it isn’t …\nstrictly honorsprenlike.”\n“What I’m about to propose isn’t strictly soldierlike,” he said. “We’ll\nmake it work.”\n“We … really will, won’t we?” she asked. “We can do this.”\n“We can,” he said. He’d protect Narak—and he intended to do so as\nhimself: a scientist.\nHe swooped down, along with his Windrunner command staff: Ka, head\nscribe, and Leyten, the stout head quartermaster—who was to be Sigzil’s\nsecond for this operation. They were joined by Peet, Ka’s husband, another\noriginal member of Bridge Four.\nSigzil led them westward to get a better look at the Everstorm. This\nclose, he felt dominated by it. The enemy had moved the storm across the\nentire continent last night at speed, bringing it here, then slowing it to a\ncrawl. The defense of Narak would happen in darkness, regardless of the\ntime of day."

The defense of Narak would happen in darkness, regardless of the\ntime of day.\n“Sigzil,” Vienta said in his ear, “I count more lightning strikes per\nminute than normal. It seems angry, determined.”\nHe slowed the others so they could study it, still at a distance—but close\nenough to find it overwhelming. It appeared to be gathering strength,\noverflowing with crackling red lightning and ominous thunder.\n“Storms,” Leyten said. “I mean … storm, I guess. One storm. The worst\none.”\n“Heavenly Ones,” Peet said, pointing.\nKa took the spyglass from him, both her spren and his sitting on her\nshoulder cross-legged. Though Peet wore a standard Bridge Four uniform,\nKa preferred a slit-sided havah and leggings. Sigzil had never seen her\nsummon her Shardblade as a sword outside of practice—but she used it as a\npen regularly.\n“Not just Heavenly Ones,” she said, handing the spyglass to Sigzil.\nHe peered through it to search the looming storm, where he picked out\ndistinctive glowing dots soaring in the air among the dark ones that trailed\nlong trains of cloth. Skybreakers. It looked like their entire force,\nnumbering in the hundreds. They’d arrived with the storm.\n“That’s a lot of Skybreakers,” Ka said. “I can see how they managed to\nmove so many Fused.”\nThe defenders would face as many as eight or nine hundred Fused, flown\nin by the Heavenly Ones and Skybreakers with the storm—leaving behind\ntheir conventional troops, who marched too slowly.\n“Information from the Heralds,” Vienta whispered, with Sigzil telling the\nothers, “says there are perhaps four thousand total Fused in existence—but\nbest our spies can guess, large numbers of those are too worn or mentally\noverwhelmed to be used in combat. The latest spy reports from Kholinar\nindicate the enemy has around two thousand who are functional, awake, and\nbattle capable. So …”\n“We’re facing almost half their entire force here,” Ka said. “Incredible.”\nFor the enemy who was holding huge swaths of Roshar to field fully half\nits Invested forces here … that was a huge commitment. And Sigzil had to\nresist it.\nVienta whispered to him counts she made of what she could see, and he\ntold them to Ka to report. Then together they flew back to Narak to meet the\nbattalionlord overseeing defenses: an Alethi general with light green eyes\nwho wasn’t much older than Sigzil was. This man—Balivar—had been a\nlieutenant a year and a half ago.\n“Our generals are gathered?” Sigzil asked, landing.\n“Yes, sir!” Balivar said, saluting.\n“Lead on,” Sigzil said, and they were led off of the perfectly circular\nNarak Two—the Oathgate—and onto the southwestern portion of Narak\nPrime. Like many here at the center, these two plateaus now had large, thick\nwalls protecting them, built by Stonewards.\n“Good thing the listeners didn’t have these walls,” Leyten said softly,\nrubbing at his chin. “We’d have never taken the place.” The quartermaster"

He was one of the\nmost easygoing original members of Bridge Four, and had been there that\nfirst day when Kaladin had pulled them out of bed.\n“You just like how neat and orderly it looks with the walls,” Ka said,\nwith a laugh. An Alethi woman, she kept her hair shorter than most.\n“A well-apportioned military camp is a thing of beauty,” Leyten replied.\n“Everything in its place, packed tight like a good rucksack.”\nThey were led to a small building on Narak Prime, well-guarded, where\nthe rest of Sigzil’s generals waited for orders. After speaking with the Mink\nat length, Sigzil had those orders—but he wasn’t certain what the others\nwould think. Once in the room, which was filled with maps on tables and\nwalls, he turned to regard the dozen or so generals and scribes who were\npreparing the defense.\nHe took a deep breath, stilling his nerves. Time to be a leader.\n“I’m going to change the way you’re operating here,” Sigzil said,\ngesturing to the table map of the surrounding plateaus. “You’ve pulled all\nour forces onto two plateaus: Narak Prime and Narak Two. Is that correct?”\n“Yes, sir,” Balivar said, frowning. “It’s what makes the most sense.\nThose are the two most important positions, and we have limited defenders.\nWe shore them up the best that way.”\n“I want instead,” Sigzil said, “to spread our defense across these four\nplateaus, all of which have walls.” He pointed at Narak Prime and Narak\nTwo, but then at Three and Four as well.\n“Sir?” another general, an older man, asked. He had a full head of silver\nhair—his name was Winn, Sigzil recalled from the briefings. “Is that really\nwise? Do we really have the troops to protect four plateaus?”\n“No,” Sigzil said. “And that’s the point.”\nThey gaped at him, shocked.\n“There is a principle in engineering,” Sigzil said, “where you build in\nfailure points to a device. Say, a bridge. You make it so certain parts will\nbreak first.”\n“Why build it so it will break, sir?” Balivar asked.\n“Because …” one of the scribes answered, nodding her head. “Because\nif you know where a break will happen, then you can anticipate it.”\n“Exactly,” Sigzil said. “If a bridge is going to fail, you want to know it’s\nunder too much stress before it breaks, so you can fix it. In most cases, you\nbuild a point to break that isn’t vital, to protect the one that is.” He slammed\na finger to the map. “We have to protect Narak Prime. If we lose it, then by\nthe terms of the contract, we lose the entire region—warcamps, Unclaimed\nHills, everything.\n“We need that land.

The enemy attacking here is an attempt to starve the tower because\nthey know they can’t assault it directly now that it’s awakened.”\nSigzil stabbed the map again. “We cannot afford to lose Narak Two. The\nOathgate is absolutely vital for resupplying us with gemstones, to provide\nmedical attention for our troops back at Urithiru, and—in an emergency—\nto provide a safe retreat.”\n“That’s why we’ve protected these two,” Balivar said.\n“It’s why,” Sigzil said, “we’re going to protect all four of these plateaus\n—then lure the enemy to spend time hitting one we can lose, by leaving it\nslightly less protected. We’re going to build in failure points, like in\nengineering a bridge. This isn’t an ordinary siege—we don’t have to last\nmonths, even weeks. We need to last six days. The more we can trick the\nenemy into attacking sections of our defenses that don’t actually matter, the\nbetter.”\nHe waited, his heart racing, for their objections. The obvious ones: That\nhe had never been in command of a battlefield like this before. That his\nscientific thinking was something to be mocked—among soldiers, it made\nhim so odd. He’d gone over this plan with the Mink and the others after\ndreaming it up, and they’d helped him refine it. But now … now he\nexpected …\n“That could work,” Winn, the aged general, said. “You’re right, Radiant\nSigzil. If we’ve been approaching this like any other siege, the enemy might\ntoo—they might search for weak points and strike there first. So if we build\nthose into our defenses intentionally … this could really work.”\n“Huh,” Balivar said, looking at the new battle maps and troop\npositioning numbers that Ka handed out. “It’s odd. I don’t think I’ve ever\nseen a general think like this before …”\n“It’s not as uncommon as you assume,” Winn said. “Think of how a\nsmaller military will have fallback positions during a controlled retreat,\nmaking the enemy fight for an advance. It’s like that, just with … a dash of\nengineering.”\n“I like it,” one of the scribes said. “This is a new world, with Fused—\nwhose rushes can be so powerful they’re almost impossible to stop. The\ntides of battle can turn so quickly with these incredible forces at play.\nPlanning for controlled losses is an excellent way to mitigate that.”\nThey started talking it over in detail, taking in the battle plans he’d\nbrought—scribes reading out the details. For the next hour they hashed it\nout, asking the questions that Sigzil—with the Mink’s help—already had\nanswers for. At the end of it, the orders were passed. Troops would file into\nNarak Three and Four, which had been barracks before. Arranged\nspecifically to encourage an assault on Narak Four first.\nSigzil watched it happen, a little bemused, because not once did they\nquestion him. He … was a Radiant.

True, it was Vienta who had done the calculation, but she preferred\nthat people not know—so he simply accepted the respect of the others as he\nprovided guidance.\nAt the end they broke, with Sigzil appointing Balivar to head up ground\ndefenses. Sigzil would continue to oversee general strategy, but much of his\nmoment-to-moment attention would be on making certain the enemy didn’t\nobtain air dominance.\n“Storms,” he said, walking out of the small room to see troops in motion.\n“Leyten … that worked.”\nThe affable man slapped him on the back.

Now here they were, in command of the\nplace’s entire military structure.\n“You did good in there, Sig,” Leyten said. “You wowed them.” He ran\noff to see that the camp had enough of things like arrows, while Ka\nremained conferring with the camp scribes.

Skybreakers served the enemy, as did\nall the Dustbringers, but those had retreated to Jah Keved after\nTaravangian’s betrayal. That put his three hundred against nine—but with\nhim having far greater conventional forces, and a dozen Shardbearers.\nNot a fair fight, as the enemy had the advantage … but his strategy could\naccount for that. Assuming it worked, assuming they could win within that\nterrible black storm with its crimson lightning.\nThe enemy’s forces were always bolstered by the storm.\n“I believe in you,” Vienta whispered. “I … believe in us, Sigzil.

Beyond that, they robbed\nyou.”\n“I know,” Father said. “But … my little boy …”\n“How could this happen?” Mother said, her voice strong, like a towering\ntree. Firm, immovable. “Colors-nimi, how could you let your soldiers run\nrampant like this?”\n“They have been more difficult to control lately,” the Farmer said. “It\nmust be because I let them fight. They get a taste for it, and subtraction … it\nfeeds upon itself, Zeenid.”\nSzeth squeezed his eyes shut. He had subtracted. No. That was a\nsanitized word.\nHe’d killed someone. With a rock to the head.\n“What are you saying?” Father asked. “What does this mean for my\nson?”\n“He did nothing wrong,” the Farmer assured him. “The fault lies entirely\nupon the soldiers, and upon me as their supervisor. At the same time, what\nyour son did … changes a person.”\n“No,” Mother said. “I won’t have you say in one breath he did nothing\nwrong, and in another imply he is broken.”\n“He is not broken,” the Farmer said. “We need people capable of actions\nlike this. The raids grow more frequent. I need soldiers who were raised\nwell, who are moral and strong, but who can also subtract when needed.”\nIn the silence that followed, Szeth could hear leaves rustling. The\ngurgling of the distant brook. The grinding of wills between his parents and\nthe man they obeyed.\n“This is a talent,” the Farmer said. “The Stone Shamans teach that it is.\nYour son should be sent for training.”\n“In how to kill?” Father asked, his voice cracking.\n“Do you know the stories of the Knights Radiant?” the Farmer asked.\n“They had a philosophy. They called it … watchers at the rim. They went to\nfight, and be changed, so we might live.”\n“You want to do this to our son?” Mother asked.\n“He’s already killed a man, Zeenid, and he used a stone to do it. He\nblasphemed. But soldiers, they can touch rocks, and iron forged from the\nblood of the earth. Sending him away would protect him from what he did."

If the shamans discover he was hiding that stone\n…”\n“We all found that stone,” Mother said. “We—”\n“It is well,” the Farmer said. “Let’s face the problem before us, not ones\nin the past.” His voice was so calming, as if it came from the brook or the\nleaves. If Szeth were ever to be blessed to hear the spren, he imagined their\nvoices would be the same.\n“No,” Szeth whispered to himself. “You will never hear the spren, Szeth.\nYou aren’t worthy of that.”\nDon’t be so certain, a voice—that same one—said in his head. We watch\nyou, Szeth. We are curious.\nHe felt a sudden jolt. Again? What did it mean?\n“You’re going to take him away,” Mother said. “You’re going to steal\nhim and turn him into a killer.”\n“I’m sorry,” the Farmer said. “You can visit him though.”\nMore silence, full of the sounds of the winds. Then a sound of wood\ngroaning as someone stood up on the steps outside. A voice somehow\nstronger than the wind, or the trees, or the river. A voice like the stones.\n“No,” Szeth’s father said. “I will not visit. If you are taking my son, then\nI will go with him. I will learn to subtract as well.”\nSomething broke in Szeth then. It was a strange sensation, feeling his\nemotions snap, like a clay vessel dropped to the ground. A burst of pain at\nhearing his father insist—followed by rushing warmth and relief.\nSzeth wouldn’t be alone.\n“Neturo!” the Farmer said. “You are my best administrator!”\n“No longer. If you are going to teach my son to kill, then you will teach\nme as well so that he is never alone with what he must do.”\n“Then Elid and I will go too,” Mother said. “If she hates it, we will let\nher move to the town with her cousins, as she has often asked.”\n“This is insanity,” the Farmer said.\n“No,” Father replied. “We are a family. My son will not step into the\ndarkness alone. If you need me to break something to prove I am willing,\npoint me toward the other two soldiers who robbed me, then left my son in\nthe hands of a drunken monster.”\nThe Farmer heaved a long sigh. “At least think about this first. You\nmight reconsider.”\n“Are you going to reconsider?” Father asked.\n“No,” the Farmer admitted.\n“Then neither,” Father said, “will I.”\nI challenge that itself to be perfidious; having studied much of\ntheir natures, and having made a specific attempt to represent\ntheir minds accurately, I find myself confident in my delineation;\nit is of particular passion and perfection in me; as perhaps I\nwould have known them myself, given opportunity.\n—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 2\nShallan emerged into what felt like the real world.

She gasped,\ngrinning, and knelt and stuck her hands into it. Storms. It was just like she’d\nread.\nSeveral singers kept running, but two others lurched to a halt nearby.\nShallan appeared to be wearing a singer body, even to her own eyes. That\nwas odd, wasn’t it? Dalinar always saw himself as himself; she’d read the\naccounts several times.\n“Shallan?” asked a tall singer with a mostly white skin pattern.\n“Yup.”\n“And Renarin?” The tall one peered at the third, a shorter singer with\nblack and red in swirls.\n“This is … eerie,” Shallan said, prodding the carapace on her face. “Glys\nand Tumi said we’d have a Lightweaving over us, but I feel like I’m in the\nactual body of this singer.”\n“It’s complicated,” Rlain said. “Which is … a way of saying I don’t\ncompletely understand. We can’t afford to be recognized by anyone, not\neven Brightlord Dalinar. When we enter, the vision itself assigns us people\nto take over. Then, Glys and Tumi nudge us to actually take the shape.”\n“Where are our spren?” Renarin asked, and his voice sounded odd. No\nrhythm, she realized.\nRlain winced. He heard it too.\n“I feel Tumi,” Rlain said. “Hovering outside the vision and watching, to\nnot give us away.”\n“Ah …” Renarin said. “Yes. That’s for the best. Um …” He held his\nhands out and inspected them. “Shallan, are you all right?”\n“I like this carapace,” she said, standing up. “It feels neat. And the dirt\ntoo! I can’t wait to step on plants that don’t move. Won’t that be surreal?”\n“Doesn’t look like many plants have grown here yet.” Renarin pointed\ndown the hillside to an enormous flat basin of dirt. Wet dirt, judging by how\nthe people trudged through it.\n“There,” Rlain said, singling out one figure below. “That’s your father,\nisn’t it?”\n“And Navani with him,” Shallan said. “So we can see them as\nthemselves. But the two Ghostblood assassins …”\n“… will be hiding,” Renarin said quietly. “Like us. They could be\nanyone on that field.” He took a deep breath. “Still, we have the advantage.\nYou heard the Ghostbloods say they’re going to watch my father and aunt,\nso we have intel on the enemy’s movements. That puts us at a tactical\nadvantage.”\nRlain hummed softly.\n“What?” Renarin asked.\n“You sound like your father,” Rlain said. “In the best of ways.”\nRenarin glanced at the ground, and she sensed a blush in his posture—\nwhich she found very curious, especially given how he looked back up\ntoward Rlain in an admiring way. Could it be … these two? She couldn’t\nwait to ask Adolin. Maybe he knew something. For now she led the way\ndown the slope.\n“You two should try not to speak too much,” Rlain noted."

For now she led the way\ndown the slope.\n“You two should try not to speak too much,” Rlain noted.\n“We don’t have to fool other singers, fortunately,” Renarin said. “Just\nsome humans.”\n“I wonder if I could do it,” Shallan said, trying to mimic Rlain’s rhythm.\n“I might have to someday, in the real world.”\nRlain halted in place, his eyes wide, humming a tense rhythm. Shallan\nmatched it.\n“How are you doing that?” he demanded. “That’s a perfect rhythm.”\n“It feels natural in this body,” she said, shrugging. “I’m mostly imitating\nyou.”\n“It’s uncanny,” he said, resuming his descent. “But be careful. If you\nonly imitate, you’ll often hum one that isn’t appropriate for your\nconversation.”\nTogether, they reached the bottom of the slope and set up there to watch.\n“Why stop here?” Renarin asked. “Aren’t we going to go find the\nGhostbloods?”\nStorms. She was so used to working with the Unseen Court that she’d\nforgotten these two had practically no experience. “Our first objective,” she\nsaid, “is to be as unobtrusive as we can. Try not to draw their attention. Us\nreturning might seem odd, since the others were running away. Therefore,\nwe should act as if we were sent back to watch.”\n“Right,” Renarin said. “So how do we learn anything?”\nShe narrowed her eyes. “Look for anyone sticking a little too close to\nDalinar or Navani. And give me a minute.” She studied the area, noting the\ngroups of human refugees making their way out of the wet dirt. Exhausted,\nburned, terrified.\nThe first arrival of humans on Roshar. What a thing to witness. However,\nVeil coached her quietly—helping her keep her mind on the job at hand,\nreminding her of the skills she’d been practicing since childhood. When you\nhad an abusive father and an insane mother, you learned to act.\nI think, Veil whispered, we’ve always been a little better at this than we\nadmitted.\nIt was true. Shallan had always worried that Veil acted like an expert in\nespionage, but was actually a scared child. However, in some ways that\nscared child was the queen of putting on faces. She shouldn’t have had to\ngo through such a terrible, painful childhood—but since she had, she might\nas well storming weaponize it.\n“Continue pretending to be scouts,” she whispered. “Back up a little.\nAdopt nervous postures. I’m going in.”\n“In?” Renarin said.\n“I can do this better than Mraize can,” Shallan whispered. “It’s time to\nprove it.”\nShe moved out from behind the rocks in a low, nervous gait. She wasn’t\nseeing humans, but bizarre, frightening aliens. She got close, skittish,\nclutching her spear. The gathered people shouted, so she sought refuge\nbehind another rock, closer to the mud.\nThen she moved out, creating two illusions—leaving a fake version of\nthe singer behind, while Shallan instead trudged forward wearing the face\nand the loose and ragged gown of one of the refugees she’d seen.

Covered\nin both ash and that wet mud. A simple brown dress, long as her ankles. A\nlittle embroidery.\nStorms, Shallan, Radiant thought.\nWhat?\nYou didn’t need a drawing first. You just did it.\nShe … she was right. Shallan had been moving in this direction, but had\nshe ever fully created a Lightweaving without any kind of drawing? It was\n… well, it was about time. She checked for weapons and found her anti-\nStormlight dagger in a sheath at her belt—and added it to her costume.\nFirst confirm he’s here, she thought at herself. Watching Dalinar and\nNavani. Try to figure out if he has tells that will let me spot him in the\nfuture. Then retreat and come up with a real plan for eliminating him.\nThat wasn’t her weakness showing, was it? She could kill Mraize. As\nshe’d killed every other mentor in her life so far and—\nDo you need me? Radiant asked.\nNo, Shallan said, stepping into the wet dirt, finding it exactly as slippery\nand messy as she’d hoped it would be. She started out past the refugees,\nattempting to project that she had forgotten something. Just another refugee\nhuman. It was a good thing she had lots of practice, because being Shallan\nwearing a singer’s body, wearing a Lightweaving of a different human, was\na lot of layers to peel back.\nShe waved on the few people that spoke to her, though—with alarm—\nshe realized she couldn’t understand them. She smiled in an exhausted way\nand pointed, deliberately saying something too soft for them to hear over\nthe crowd.\nThey moved on as she continued walking. Dalinar and Navani were\ntalking to … was that Wit? Or a simulacrum of Wit? She forcibly kept from\nstaring, and instead found her way to an animal that was mired in the mud.\nWith a smile to the people there, she took the ropes at its neck and began\nhelping pull it free, giving her a reason to linger near Dalinar and Navani.\nSo, where would Mraize be? she wondered. They started to get the\nstrange horse free, but then one of the workers slid, tugging the animal\nfarther into the mud. He’ll want to be somewhere he can overhear …\nThe refugees were mostly flowing past without stopping. With effort, she\nkept from looking through the portal into the other world. The horse-thing\nmoved, barely. It seemed that …\nThat the other people working with her were barely trying. One grunted\nand waved her off, kneeling so he could peer at the animal’s legs, to check\nthem for wounds, maybe?\nShallan had immediately found the easiest way to remain close to\nDalinar without being spotted … because Mraize had set up this situation to\ndo the same. Storms. That had to be either him or Iyatil kneeling in the mud\nin front of her. Her gut said it was Mraize. Not because he acted like\nhimself—indeed, he didn’t.

Instead of confident, he was kind of bumbling\n—and when he stood, hands on his hips, he gave a rueful smile. Except it\nwas very similar to the act he’d put on when pretending to be a soldier in\nUrithiru.\nHaving one or two personas you default to, Shallan thought, is almost as\nmuch of a tell as acting like yourself. She’d likely made that same mistake\nin the past.\nShe gripped her knife, but didn’t draw it. Dalinar pushed past them in the\nwet soil, saying to Navani that he was going to speak to the Stormfather.\nMraize traced Dalinar’s departure with his eyes. Shallan would never have a\nbetter chance than this.\nBut …\nRadiant took over, pulling the knife and swinging as Mraize walked past\nher toward Dalinar. Mraize spotted her motion in the corner of his eye and\ncursed, catching her arm right before she connected. Radiant saw genuine\npanic in his expression as she forced him into the side of the muddy animal,\ncausing other refugees to scream and back off.\nHe held to her forearm with both hands, grunting, then eyed her. “That’s\na dangerous knife for you, little one,” he said, letting a smile creep to the\ncorner of his mouth. “Have you gone and grown up on me?”\nUnfortunately, he was stronger than she was. To get an edge, Radiant\ntried to summon her armor, which resulted in a bunch of tiny knives\nappearing in the sticky wet dirt, quivering and saying, “Other Shallan!”\nSo … no armor in this realm. Radiant pushed back from him, ripping out\nof his grip—a move that he should have been able to prevent, but he\nseemed wary, and eager to keep her at a distance.\n“How long?” Shallan asked.\n“How long what?” he asked, wiping his face, leaving a smear of dirt.\n“How long,” Shallan said softly, “have you secretly been afraid of me?”\nOddly, he smiled. “Since I discovered that you had killed Tyn. Why\nwould I recruit someone I wasn’t at least in part frightened of? Why hunt\nsomething that can’t fight back?”\nThat smile. So confident. Shallan wanted, on a gut level, to remove it.\nThankfully, Radiant was more levelheaded. She knew, from Adolin’s\nlessons, the foolish danger in attacking a taller, stronger opponent with only\na knife. His hand had gone down by his side, almost certainly for his own\nweapon. If she allowed herself to be drawn into a brawl, he’d have a severe\nadvantage.\nSo she instead feinted an attack, then stepped back, hiding her knife.\nWhen he pulled out his weapon, she raised her arms and stumbled away,\nshrieking. The onlookers, who had been confused up until now, lurched into\naction, grabbing Mraize. Though she’d been the first aggressor, they\nprobably hadn’t seen that, as it had been so unexpected. Several also moved\nto block Shallan from Mraize, holding out warding hands—but they\nobviously thought they knew who was the more dangerous, because they\nrestrained Mraize, while merely keeping her away.

He\nsomehow spoke their language.\nCould she use the situation? Persuade the others he was dangerous? This\nwas a tired, emotional lot.\n“Kill him,” a soft voice said from beside her.\nShallan’s voice.\nShallan spun and saw a figure dressed identically to her—but with a\nhead made all of curling grey smoke. Spiraling, shifting, mesmerizing.\n“It’s what we are, Shallan,” the figure said. “It’s what we need to\nbecome. You cannot reject me forever. I am you.”\n“F-Formless?” Shallan whispered. “I banished you.”\n“I am you.”\n“No,” Shallan said, backing up. “I banished you.”\n“And yet,” it said, stepping forward, “you come to a realm of\npossibilities and futures. Tell me, are you better because of one good day?\nWill you ever be fully ‘better’?”\n“I can be better,” she hissed. “I can.”\n“Can you?” Formless asked, and all else seemed to fade. “You are what\nyou were made into, Shallan. You are what was done to you. That is me. I\nam your future.”\nShallan screamed and hunched down, her hands like claws, one open,\none gripping her knife. The vision vanished. All became swirling mist, and\nshe felt someone embrace her. Pattern.\n“Calm, Shallan,” he said. “Calm …”\nPanting, she let him hold her. She couldn’t see well in this place of\nshifting shapes and futures, like mixing paint, but she heard Rlain speak\nsomewhere nearby.\n“Well, that could have gone better,” he said, his voice thrumming with a\nrhythm.\n“Let’s find somewhere to recover and regroup,” Renarin said. “Our spren\nare panicking. They’re certain that in another few moments we’d have been\nnoticed by the gods. We need to do this without making so much of a\nscene.”\n“Murdering someone makes a scene,” Shallan mumbled. “At least it has\nevery time I’ve done it …” But she let herself be pulled away into the mists\nof the future.\nThe Stormfather appeared as a shimmer to Dalinar. Standing on the\nmountainside, looking down at the newly arrived humans.\nDalinar stopped in front of the spren, studying him. Today, he thought he\ncould even catch some shape to the shimmering—one that matched the\nimage he’d seen of the dead god, Honor, also named Tanavast.\nThe Stormfather was an echo of the Almighty.

They’re called dogs.” He fell silent a moment.\n“Tanavast always said he missed hounds. Too small a breeding population\nmade it through. They will be gone in three hundred years.”\n“Hounds?” Dalinar said. “Like axehounds?”\n“Your ancestors bred axehounds as a replacement, as they fit the same\necological niche. They have some of the same mannerisms. It’s a …\ncuriosity of genetics and parallel evolution. If you breed for certain traits—\nsuch as obedience—sometimes you get a few of the same companion traits.\n“The pigs … they’ll thrive on Roshar; they’re willing to eat anything.\nThose minks will become wild and feral. The rats made it, remarkable\nconsidering how few snuck through, but I’ve learned never to be surprised\nat where you find rats. Look. The birds are about to arrive.”\nDalinar turned as people began to cry out, ducking as an enormous group\nof chickens came soaring in through the portal. Thousands of them.\n“They flocked on the other side,” the Stormfather said, “corralled and\ncornered by rising temperatures and the burning sky. It is a miracle they\nfound their way here, but they must have followed the sudden cool air. Or\nperhaps … perhaps the Wind sought them out. They will thrive. Parrots of\ntwo dozen varieties, who can eat the grains of Roshar until other options\nbegin to grow in Shinovar.”\nDalinar didn’t reply, merely listening. Sometimes the Stormfather would\njust talk, and you never knew what you might learn.\n“I don’t remember this,” the Stormfather continued, “yet I do. I wasn’t\nalive, wasn’t aware.”\nHe didn’t go on, so after a while Dalinar prompted him. “Tanavast was\nalive though. You have some of his memories.”\n“Echoes only,” the Stormfather said. “Little that is relevant. A fondness\nfor dogs …”\n“What happened on Ashyn, really?” Dalinar said.\n“I do not know.”\n“And … the Wind you mentioned earlier. It spoke to me.”\n“A fallen god.”\n“A fallen god,” Dalinar said. “There are gods other than Honor,\nCultivation, and Odium? Here on Roshar?”\n“There are pieces of the god who made the planet,” the Stormfather said.\n“No longer relevant, as humans—poorly adapted to this land—began to fear\nthe storm above all else. And so it took on life … became an Adversary. A\nnew demigod for Roshar.”\nDalinar nodded, thoughtful. The god who had made this world, perhaps\nthe very God Beyond that Dalinar had begun to follow … they had left\ncaretakers in the spren. But when that god vanished—dead and shattered,\nby Wit’s testimony—the spren had grown into something else. Something\nmore tied to Honor, Cultivation, and Odium."

The true origin for his people\n—and all humans—on this world. He checked his clock, and found that it\nwas still the fourth day. He had time.\n“The power of Honor is here,” Dalinar said. “Around us.”\n“It will never accept you.”\n“Why not?” Dalinar asked.\n“Because it cannot stand another who would do what Honor did.”\nThere.\nThat seemed relevant.\n“What Honor did?” Dalinar said. “Stormfather, what exactly did Honor\ndo?”\nThe shimmering hesitated a moment, as if realizing it had said too much.\n“It is connected,” Dalinar said. “What happened to Honor, how he died\n—and the way I could take up the power. I need to know how the previous\ngod died before I could hope to hold that same position.

I will try to send you back now, if you will go. But you\nNOUGH OF THIS\nmust swear to never try this again.”\n“No,” Dalinar said, recognizing this was what he had to do. The others\nwould have to fight battles without him, for now. He had to remain here and\nfind his way to these secrets.\n“You doom yourself,” the Stormfather said. “And your wife. And others.\nY !”\nOU SHOULD NOT DEFY ME\n“Stormfather,” Dalinar said quietly, “do you remember when we talked a\nfew days ago? Do you remember what you told me?”\nSilence.\n“You can change,” Dalinar said. “We do not have to be combatants, as\nwe often have been.”\n“All it takes is a willingness …” the Stormfather whispered. “It is too\nlate for me, Dalinar. You … should not try so hard with me. I am but a\nspren.” His voice grew softer. “Please, just come back.”\nDalinar wavered a moment, then shook his head. “No. I’ve seen the\nvisions as you wanted to present them, Stormfather. I will now see what\nactually occurred. I will find out what happened to Honor, and why his\npower has chosen no successor.”\n“So like your brother,” the Stormfather whispered. “So arrogant.”\n“Why do you have an opinion on Gavilar?” Dalinar asked, confused.\n“Did you interact with him?”\nThe Stormfather seemed to come more alert at this, as if he’d said\nsomething wrong. Revealed something. The moment of Connection\nbetween them—of understanding, as had happened occasionally during\ntheir time together—evaporated. “You will die in here!” the spren\nthundered. “You will wander for eons, then wither away!”"

Once in a while, it went so well between them, like when the\nStormfather had told him about Eshonai’s death.

He’d spent half his time out hunting, and the other half picking\nfights. He’d died in a duel when she was seventeen, and his last words to\nher had been to ask if, in her biography of him, she could include a\nparticularly vile insult about the man who had stabbed him.\nShe’d never written that biography. That neglected task was one of\nhundreds that haunted her, and for some reason this place—this jaunt into\nthe Spiritual Realm—reminded her of him. Why?\nThe question chased her as she trudged through the mud past refugees\nand toward the open portal. There, she realized part of what was itching at\nher. She still felt Connected to something, someone, out there. It was the\nsame sensation she’d felt when searching for Dalinar earlier.\nSomeone was watching from the Spiritual Realm. Someone she knew\nwell. Was it … her father? No. But whatever that Connection was, she\ncouldn’t identify it—and she also couldn’t contact the Sibling, though not\nfor lack of trying.\nShe stood in the mud, hands on her hips, dissatisfied with the way people\nflowed around her, frightened. She hadn’t missed that the king and his\nspearmen kept their attention directly on her. Indeed, there was a\ndisturbance happening—several refugees squabbling—but she couldn’t get\na good view of them because of the soldiers barricading her way.\nShe folded her arms.

Nearby, the stream of tired people had slowed to a trickle. But it\nwasn’t long before another group came through, different from the others.\nTheir clothing less refined: more furs tied closed, less cloth. They clustered\ntogether and gave distrusting glares to others.\nShin, Navani realized, catching sight of a few of the faces hidden deep in\ntheir hoods. I’m witnessing the arrival of the Shin.\nThe portal itself interested her too. It had swelled even further, perhaps\nto eighty feet wide, level with the ground on the bottom. After a moment’s\nthought, Navani settled on an idea. She walked straight to the portal,\nkeeping space between her and the refugees. The soldiers, not wanting to be\ntouched by her, moved away—then trailed after her.\nJasnah felt creating things like this—portals that could transport people\naround Roshar—should be possible with Elsecaller abilities, but they had\nno clues how to accomplish it, and Jasnah’s experiments hadn’t borne fruit.\nSo what could Navani learn about this portal? One powerful enough to\nbring these people from an entirely different world? Well, observation\nnumber one: this portal required continued effort to maintain. Ishi’Elin\nremained standing on the other side, his arms stretched out, palms flat, as if\nhe were physically pushing the portal open. The edges rippled and\nfluctuated, shrinking if he lost concentration or strength.\nAt this point, Navani thought, he might not be a Bondsmith, since this\nlooks like an Elsecalling. So, some of the Heralds were practiced in\ndifferent Surges from the ones they would one day take up as Heralds.\nWithin the portal, there was maybe six inches of “tunnel” between the\nworlds. It was a shimmering silvery color. As she watched people cross\nfrom the other side, their forms seemed to fuzz briefly, then fuzz again as\nthey stepped out on this side.\nIt’s like they fall in on the other side, she thought, then fall out on this\nside—like they slide through space and emerge. It’s less like a doorway you\nstep through, and more like something you step into—which then carries\nyou a distance.\nShe doubted she had enough understanding of these kinds of physics to\ndraw conclusions. Best to memorize her observations, then present them to\nher team when she returned. Regardless, it was good to make some order\nfrom the chaos. As always, a few key observations—a few thoughts about\nthe mechanics of her situation—gave her some small measure of control. Or\nat least it made her feel that way.\nFlocks of chickens burst through the top of the portal some twenty-five\nfeet up. She considered, then reached out a finger to touch the portal.\nBehind her, someone cried out. She looked to find the king still watching\nher—a teenaged Shalash peeking out from behind him. He stepped forward,\npointing and speaking in an authoritarian way.\n“He’s saying,” a voice said from beside her, “that you shouldn’t go\nthrough—that the other side is dangerous.”\nShe glanced over and found Wit sitting in the mud to her left—his face"

He somehow talked\nwithout it. Distant thunder sounded, but she kept her attention on him.\n“Um, thank you,” she said. “Are you … feeling all right?”\n“Me?” the faceless Wit said. “Oh, I’m fine. Just a big mess of existential\ncrisis! Me, who is not me, knowing that I’ll puff away back to nothing the\nmoment this vision ends. It’s fun! Like realizing you’ve swallowed poison\nby accident!”\n“I’m sorry,” she said.\n“It’s fine,” he said. “I’m not real, so my emotions don’t matter! My pain\nis an illusion, and I’m a puppet for raw Investiture, propped up and\nspeaking like the sock on a child’s hand.” He cocked his head. “Damn. Is\nthis how the Iriali feel all the time? No wonder they’re so storming odd.”\n“What happens if I step through?” she asked.\n“Nothing,” fake-Wit replied. “Because you can’t. This vision is tied to\nRoshar. You can see what it saw—the light passing through the Elsegate—\nbut if you try to step through, nothing will happen.”\n“The Spiritual Realm is all places,” Navani said. “That’s what you—um,\nwhat real-world-Wit—told us.”\n“Yup, true,” he said. “But you’re not a god, Navani. This vision is the\nSpiritual Realm trying very hard to provide something your mind can\nunderstand. Push it too far, and that will unravel. So, fair warning.”\n“Warning taken,” she replied. She nodded toward Jezrien and his\ndaughter. “Could you tell them I’m not dangerous?”\n“You want me to lie?” Wit asked.\n“I’m not dangerous.”\n“Did you or did you not melt a man’s eyes straight out of his head some\nfive days ago?”\nShe hesitated. “I’m not dangerous to them.”\n“Of course you aren’t,” he said. “They’re not alive.”\nStorms above and Light Almighty … this fake Wit was even more\naggravating than the real one. She stood, hands on her hips, looking at him\n—and he flopped back in the mud, blank face toward the sky, mumbling to\nhimself about things like “infinite recursion” and “synthetic consciousness.”\nNavani sighed and turned again toward Jezrien and his daughter, still\nprotected by guards. She smiled at the king, then tried bowing. He nodded\nto her. So she approached him slowly, hands to the sides to show she meant\nno harm.\nShe didn’t dare get too close, so she stopped maybe five feet away and\nhoped he’d also move forward to meet her. He didn’t—he studied her,\nthoughtful. But his daughter—who had a darker skin tone than his—slipped\nout from behind him. She stepped forward, ignoring her father’s warning,\nand put out her hand to touch Navani’s.\nNavani squatted down closer to Shalash’s eye level, and laced their\nfingers together.

Sometime in\nthe future, these two—with eight others—would found the Oathpact. One\nof the most important events in history.\nDalinar had apparently finished his conversation, as she could see him\napproaching through the mud. Had that thunder earlier been because of\nhim?\n“The vision will end soon,” fake-Wit said. “You came here to see the\ncrossing, and you did. You’ll be cast out into the ever-mixing churn of\npossibilities and memories.”\n“And we’ll be left without a guide,” she said. “We need a way to return\nto the Physical Realm.”\n“Good luck with that,” fake-Wit said. “Your husband just rejected the\nStormfather’s offer to send you back! Haha!”\nNavani held to Shalash’s hand, eye to eye. A wind blew across them, and\nshe thought she heard a song carried with it. Faintly familiar.\n“Can you help?” she asked the Wind.\nI … do not know … it whispered. Your husband decided to stay. He is …\nboth wise and foolish … He has realized that the only path forward is\nthrough time. You must find the day that Honor died …\nThat day was at least five thousand years into the future. How would\nthey ever find it?\nMaybe I don’t have to, Navani thought, looking at Shalash. Not yet.\nCultivation told us to see history—and that’s why we came. What if I first\nfind a way to jump us forward in time a little—then from there I can search\nout the next step.\n“The Oathpact,” Navani whispered. “Its founding. These two will be\nthere. I need a guide, an anchor, to that moment.”\nAh … the Wind whispered. Her ribbon. Take her ribbon …\nNavani smiled at the young Shalash. Both she and her father seemed\nmore friendly than they had been earlier, perhaps having realized Navani\nwasn’t dangerous. Unfortunately, the distant hills were warping, turning to\nStormlight, evaporating. As Wit had warned, this vision was ending.\nNavani mimed at her own hair, then at Ash’s. The girl felt at her head,\nthen—questioning—took off her ribbon and placed it in Navani’s hand.\nA moment later the vision burst, and all the people unraveled into\nStormlight. But the ribbon remained clutched in Navani’s fingers.\nAdolin felt a lot better after a few hours of sleep. Bolstered, he made use of\nthe well-equipped, overly bronze bathing facility his officers had been\nassigned. He shaved and put on a fresh uniform, then got an update from\none of Kaminah’s assistants. Two assaults in four hours. No progress made\non either side, which was a win for the defenders—though that singer\nfortress at the center held, repelling dropped stones.\nColot had gone to bed right before Adolin had woken up, and for once\nthe dome was quiet. The enemy might have more troops, but they still had\nto worry about depleting them. Perhaps they had decided to hunker down,\nreinforce their fortress, and discuss strategy.

It was what he’d have done\nafter over a full day of losing large numbers to the offensive with no\ndiscernible progress.\nHe left his blackout tent and found it was already getting dark. As he did,\nhis timid scribe whispered to him some bad news: His worst fears were\nproving true. The Azish reserve forces had been delayed. An enemy force of\nsome sort had raided them, a mystery troop that baffled their generals. The\ndelay was, they hoped, a short one—and they were already moving again.\nThe current estimate had their reinforcements at least two days out.\nAdolin wasn’t too surprised, though a mystery force worried him. What\nwas going on there? Regardless, the enemy was going to try anything they\ncould to delay those troops to keep Azimir isolated as long as possible. He\ntook the news, then shook his head and scanned the darkened plaza.\nAdolin’s armor standby had just put on his Plate for a shift, giving Adolin a\nlittle time. So he did something that was always near the top of a\ncommander’s list, but never quite as urgent as it should be: he went to visit\nthe injured.\nThe Azish field hospital was one of the nicest he had ever seen. As May\nhad suggested, the surgeons were set up in a building right near the dome.\nHe entered a world of sterile scents, recently mopped floors, white walls,\nand whiter linens. The Azish took to heart the old teachings of the Heralds,\nthat dirt and disorder attracted rotspren, that washing hands and boiling\ninstruments prevented infection.\nAdolin had met armies who ignored such rules, and inevitably infection\nset in—visible by the spren they attracted. It didn’t take much\nexperimenting to see which way was better, and he was pleased to see this\nhospital so well equipped. He got a quick, secret briefing on how to open\nthe saferoom hidden underneath the structure, then went out to visit the\nsoldiers.\nThe Truthwatcher could be spared to help solely those whose wounds\nwere life-threatening. Otherwise, the work would overwhelm and exhaust\nher. So there were plenty of painspren creeping on the floor, and a good\nnumber of men whose wounds would keep them out of the battle. Adolin\nstopped by bed after bed, his scribe quietly ensuring he remembered names,\nor providing them for those he had never met.\nHe chatted with each soldier in turn, laughing and joking with them,\nencouraging them and commending their service. Most only wanted to\nknow that their squad was doing fine. He gave needed reassurances—that a\nwound was a price sometimes paid for protecting one’s fellows. He\nreassured each that they weren’t letting anyone down by being out of\naction, and promised that if Rahel had extra strength, he’d allow her to do\nfurther healings to get men back on their feet.\nAs he went, anxietyspren began to fade from the room one by one. Near\nthe end of his circuit, he met with a man who was missing an arm. That was\nsomething Adolin saw less and less these days—the best of their Radiant\nhealers could now Regrow limbs. Sometimes.

So, Adolin encouraged\nthe wounded man to see the lost arm as a temporary inconvenience—and\npromised that as soon as this was over, he would get the man to a more\nexperienced healer.\n“Well, if nothing else,” the wounded man said, “maybe I have a future\non a bridge crew!”\nAdolin laughed, though he wondered if the members of Bridge Four—\nand to a lesser extent, Bridge Thirteen—knew quite how famous they were.\nEach member, including many who had died before joining Dalinar’s army,\nhad taken on near-mythological status in the Alethi military.\nAdolin gave the soldier a firm squeeze on the shoulder and a nod of\nappreciation—for Adolin, that always seemed to work better than salutes.\nThen he stood up and checked the time. He could probably visit a few of\nthe Azish wounded. Would they like that from a foreign officer? He looked\ndown the long hallway, which was occupied by …\nHe trailed off as he recognized someone sitting beside a bed: a thin\nwoman, with Azish skin coloring and Shin eyes, although she showed some\nhints of her Alethi parentage as well. If those were even the right terms, for\na woman who had been born before Azir, Shinovar, or Alethkar had existed.\nHer name was Shalash, but people called her Ash. Herald of the\nAlmighty. Adolin hesitated, his guards and scribe for the day huddling\nbehind him as they saw what he had. She sat beside a bed that held a\nmountain of a human being: Talenel, the Bearer of Agonies. The one they\nhad left behind, and who—in finally breaking—had ushered in the return of\nthe enemy.\n“What are you staring at, princeling?” Ash called to him.\n“I didn’t realize you were here,” he said.\n“We are an afterthought,” Ash said, shrugging. “Your father brought us\nto Azir on his campaign; it seems he wants to keep us near, hoping our\nwisdom will rub off on him. That makes him the greater fool, since we have\nno wisdom left. Only madness and grief.”\nAdolin stopped beside the bed and gazed at Taln, who lay on his back,\neyes closed—muttering to himself.\n“Is he all right?” Adolin asked.\nAsh’s glare could have melted iron. “What do you think?”\nAdolin leaned down and heard the ancient man whispering the same\nthings as always. A mantra about how he was going to help the people to\nresist the coming evils.\n“Are you worth it?” Ash asked.\n“Pardon?” Adolin asked.\n“Are you worth it?” She rested her hands on Taln’s arm. “Do you know\nthe price that was paid on a distant world for your peace, by a man who\nnever wanted this? A man who would have been content with his horses?\nAre you worth it?”\n“I don’t know,” Adolin said, honest.\n“Time will tell.”"

Rahel had joined his cluster of\nattendants: a young woman maybe seventeen with long ombre hair, going\nfrom dark brown to light brown. Her mistspren shone on the wall,\nappearing like scattered light; it was the uncorrupted variety. Rare, for one\nof those to let themself be seen by others. Perhaps it was for the Heralds’\nbenefit.\n“I’m sorry, Brightlord,” the young Radiant said. “She refuses to let me\ntry to heal him.”\n“Your touch couldn’t do anything for that man,” Adolin assured her.\n“Just like I can’t heal the lost limbs …” she said, accompanied by\nshamespren.\n“You’re doing wonderfully,” Adolin assured her. “Half those men would\nbe dead if not for you. Think of yourself as a field medic: your job isn’t to\nfix them up perfectly; your job is to make sure they survive until they can\nbe fixed up.”\nShe nodded, then moved back to her station, where she had a stack of\nnovels to keep her occupied between healings. Poor kid. Before yesterday,\nshe’d probably never seen what battle could do—and now she would have a\nreminder every few hours. During these next days, she’d likely get even\nless sleep than he did.\nHe moved outside and found that a runner had arrived with a message.\nHis scribe of the hour read it to him. “‘Enemy made a quick attack, but then\nalmost immediately retreated,’” she said. “‘We’re licking our wounds. Low\ncasualties this time, as neither group pushed too hard. My gut says they will\ntry a Castle Down. Thoughts?’” The scribe lowered the paper. “Castle\nDown?”\n“Move from towers,” Adolin said. “He thinks the enemy has been too\nregular with their assaults—on purpose, to make us expect a rhythm. The\nnext attack will come later than expected, he thinks, as that will give us just\nenough time to start resting.” Adolin considered. Yes, this might be a better\nexplanation than he’d come up with for the enemy behavior. “Write back\nand say I agree—and that I think we should be ready for an attack between\nan hour and a half and two hours from now.”\nHe checked the sky, where the sun had vanished below the horizon. That\ntiming felt right—just long enough for the humans to start winding down\nand settle into bed. His scribe made the report via spanreed to the central\nmessage room, who would get it to Kushkam. This scribe wasn’t Kaminah,\nbut a younger girl, maybe fourteen. With frizzy hair that refused to stay in\nits braids. She’d told him her name, but … with embarrassment, he realized\nit had slipped away from him. Bad form, that. Too much to keep his mind\non, and too little sleep.\nHe asked her name again—Makana—and memorized it this time. He\nneeded to take better care of himself, and do something relaxing for now to\nlet his mind rest. And so, to that end, he gave a few quiet orders, then strode"

And so, to that end, he gave a few quiet orders, then strode\noff into the night toward the most prominent set of tents.\nHe had an imperial friend to visit, and a promise to keep.\nTWENTY-SIX YEARS AGO\nThe soldier camp smelled like people.\nFor a youth who had spent his life among sheep, human smells were\ndistracting. Wrong, like a splash of color that was too vibrant, drawing too\nmuch attention.\nHe clustered with his family at the mouth of the training yard, which\noccupied a ridge along the highlands near the Stoneward monastery. Black\nsmoke assaulted the sky, marching from bellows and forges spilling bloody\nlight. The sounds of metal on metal, like the cries of damned souls, rang\nwithin the forges—but also from the practice grounds, where men swung\nblasphemous weapons.\nStone covered the ground here, so close to the great aboshi—the\nmountaintops, and the spren who were their souls. Would his family really\njust … step on it? It was all so overwhelming—with the oppressive scents\nof sweat and the cries (and strangely, laughs) of the fighting men—that it\nmade Szeth pull against his mother’s side.\nElid stood tall, obviously trying to pretend that—as the older sibling—\nshe was stronger. She took a deep breath, then stepped off the soil onto\nstone. As she did, he caught another glare from her. This is your fault, that\nglare proclaimed, echoing what she’d said to him the night before. Though\nshe’d always seemed resentful of their slow life, she was not happy in the\nleast to have it stolen away. Still, she could have gone to live with cousins.\nA terrible decision to have to make, yes, but he couldn’t be completely\nblamed. Could he?\nFather went next, joining Elid on the stone. As Szeth hung back, holding\nto his mother, she took something from her pouch. A small sheep made of\nwool. It smelled … of Molli?\nHe touched it, then glanced up at his mother. No words passed between\nthem, though Mother wiped tears from her eyes. He’d thought Molli’s pelt\nburied, but evidently Mother had saved some of the wool. Szeth should\nhave been too old for toys, but he clutched it anyway, tucked it away before\nanyone could see. It gave him the strength to step onto the stone. It was\nhard under his feet. Wrong.\nMother joined him, and eventually a man in a leather jerkin came\njogging over. He was a burly type, with dark hair and skin. He unrolled a\nscroll, nodding to himself as he read. “Neturo-son-Vallano? Zeenid-\ndaughter-Beth? Right, welcome. Thanks for signing up. We can always use\nmore hands.”\n“We didn’t …” Father said, then trailed off. “We were forced into this.”\n“Says here only your child was,” the man replied. “You parents are\nvolunteers. That’s rare.” He dithered, then offered a hand to Szeth’s parents.\n“Betheth-son-Vetor.

Captain of recruitment and discipline.”\nFather tentatively took his hand and looked over the long camp covering\nthe ridge, full of buildings and bustling people. Father’s job had always\nbeen to herd shepherds as shepherds herded sheep. Szeth didn’t know much\nabout that, but if these soldiers had been sheep, he would have called them\na poorly watched flock. There was an air of laziness to the place. Those\nwho sparred or trained were watched by twice as many people who were\nlounging. To Szeth’s left, a large number of men congregated around the\ncookfires, where women tended great metal cauldrons.\nSome men were doing their laundry at racks farther along—Betheth said\nsoldiers were required to see to their own clothing and equipment.\nEveryone in their family would get training in the warrior’s script, and all\nbut Szeth would be allowed to—after a year—apply for work at the\nmonastery instead, if they wanted. To become acolyte shamans, where\nwomen could choose to be warriors.\nUntil then, Elid and Mother would have the choice of cooking, washing\nfloors, or tending the animals sent for slaughter. The elderly or infirm\namong the flocks were sent up here, and in abstract, Szeth had always been\nfine with this. Animals at the ends of their lives could still add this way;\neven people fed the soil when dead.\n“I don’t see families …” Mother said. “I thought people served for\ngenerations as soldiers. What of them?”\n“They usually get a transfer,” Betheth said. “They become city guards or\nwork lumberyards. It’s … more comfortable for stabler individuals.” There\nwas an implication to his voice. That he assumed Szeth’s family would\neventually find their way to such work as well. “Anyway, let me send the\nthree of you off to your bunks. You’ll have your own room, spacious as\nthings go here. I’ll take the lad to initial assessment—”\n“I’m going with him,” Father said, a hand on Szeth’s shoulder.\n“Wherever he goes.”\nBetheth hesitated, then shrugged. “Right, then. Zeenid, I’ll send you to\ncheck out the quarters …” He gave her instructions and a little map drawn\nin black charcoal. Szeth was used to writing being in ink, with reeds.\nSoldiers, it appeared, did things differently.\nOnce Mother and Elid had moved off, Betheth led Szeth and his father\naround the perimeter of the training grounds to where a small group of four\nyouths were waiting.\nBetheth held his hand toward Szeth. “You can’t be wearing that any\nlonger, son,” he said, gently. Pointing at Szeth’s handkerchief.\nNo more color. The uniforms were dark brown, and not a speck or splash\nof true color graced the camp. In taking off his kerchief and handing it over,\nSzeth felt as if he were giving up something vital that defined him.\nThis is good, the voice said in his head, making him jump. This is where\nyou belong. It had a moderate pitch; he couldn’t decide if it sounded male\nor female.\nWhat are you? Szeth thought, apprehensive. But got no reply. The voice"

The voice\nunnerved him, and he held to his father’s hand, though he probably should\nhave acted more mature. However, he was younger and smaller than the\nother youths who lined up for Betheth. None of them had fathers with them.\nBetheth nodded for Szeth to join the line. When he didn’t move, Betheth\nspoke, a sharpness to his voice. “You’re a soldier now, Szeth,” he said. “I\nam to teach you discipline. Don’t make me teach it harshly.”\nSo Szeth reluctantly let go of his father’s hand and joined the other four\nyouths in the line.\n“How do you enforce discipline here?” Father asked.\n“We make examples of the worst cases,” Betheth said.\n“And the best cases?”\n“Allowed free time.”\n“You said that the men are in charge of their own gear—”\n“Their kit and clothing, yes.”\n“How is this enforced?” Father asked.\n“Same way. Beatings if they’re sloppy.”\nFather shook his head. “Beating one sheep rarely makes the others\nobedient. It only makes them fear you.”\n“Fear makes obedience though, doesn’t it?” Betheth said. “Look, Neturo,\npeople here aren’t like the ones you know. These come because they’re\ndeviants. Problems.”\n“Problems like my son?” Father asked.\nBetheth had trouble finding words to reply to that. Father, though …\nconflict wasn’t his way. He simply stepped back, clasping his hands and\nsurveying the training field.\nThe Farmer said humans choose, Szeth thought, and are defined by that\nchoice. Is that true even here, in this place of bloody stone and men who\nsubtract?\nSzeth stood there, nervous, dwarfed by the older teens. Had they … done\nas he had? He found it hard to imagine they had … had killed someone.\nThat was difficult to acknowledge. It was as if those events had\nhappened in a dream, to another person. Yet at the same time he could still\nfeel the rock under his fingers—smooth, but rough at once. Could still feel\nthe warmth. The blood.\n“I need to know,” Betheth said, “what I’m working with in you all.” He\nwaved a thick-fingered hand as several workers walked out of a shed.\nPushing corpses: dead sheep, hung up on racks with wheels on the bottoms.\nSzeth felt nauseous.\nBetheth handed each boy a spear. “Show me what you’ve got. Pretend\nthose are enemies on the field, and you need to subtract them before they\nreach the houses beyond.”\n“If we don’t,” one of the boys said, “do we … go home?”\n“No,” Betheth said, firm. “Once you’ve been sent here, you don’t ever\ngo back. But don’t be so glum. People are wrong—subtracting isn’t evil.\nWe’re necessary parts of society. We are the most important, it might be\nargued.” He waved to the carcasses. “I just need to know what kind of\ntraining to give you. So have at it. Prove that you’re going to make full use"

I promise you, it’s far more fulfilling than you assume.\nWe, of all people, get to express what’s truly inside of us.”\nThe other boys moved forward. Then, with shocking aggression, they\nbegan to stab at and attack the carcasses. One even shouted. Once they\nstarted, they seemed to need this. To release something pent up inside. Their\nshouts resonated with Szeth. He felt so lacking in control, so frustrated by\nthe apparent nonexistence of answers. Everyone talked about him, but they\ndidn’t ask what he wanted. He gritted his teeth and started forward.\nCareful, the strange voice said, butting into his mind. This is an odd test.\nI find it amusing each time I see it done. They’re trying to judge if you’re\nout of control. If you can contain the desire to subtract or not.\nSzeth hesitated. That Voice knew a great deal.\nIt’s self-fulfilling, the Voice continued. They encourage new recruits to\nattack all out, then use that as proof that the boys were secretly broken all\nalong—that you can distinguish someone who subtracts, if you bring out\ntheir true selves. The system has been flawed for a while now, but you can\nuse that.\n“How?” Szeth whispered.\nMake a single surgical strike with the spear at the neck of the carcass.\nDon’t pretend to rage; show restraint. That will distinguish you from these\nothers.\nArms trembling, Szeth raised the spear. “What are you?” he whispered.\nI am the spren of the stone you discovered, the Voice said. And I ask that\nyou not tell others of me, Szeth. I’ve been watching over your family. I am\nsorry for what has happened, but there are important things for you to do.\nThere was … a plan for him?\nThere were answers?\nSomeone was watching?\nSzeth calmed his nerves, then gripped the spear and stabbed once at the\ncarcass’s neck. He was shocked by how easily the sharpened steel tip of the\nspear went in, until it ground against bone.\nHe pulled the spear free, then stepped back.\n“What was that, Szeth?” Betheth said. “That’s all you have?”\n“You said I needed to stop it,” Szeth said. “You said to pretend it was an\nenemy. I pretended as best I could. One stab, and that should do it, right?”\n“That’s not what the report says you did to the soldier,” Betheth said.\n“He was from this camp, you know. Others are going to talk about you.”\nRepeat after me: That man was sick.\n“That man was sick,” Szeth said.\nI did what I needed to make sure the sickness didn’t spread.\n“I did what I needed to do to make sure the sickness didn’t spread, sir.”\nNothing more. My tool was a poor one for the task, but I needed to\ndefend myself.\n“Nothing more. I’m sorry I used the rock. It was wrong of me, but I was\nunder attack.”\nBetheth nodded at those words, then he made some notes. Szeth glanced"

Szeth glanced\nback at his father, who stood with his arms folded, lost in thought as he\nstared at the camp. Neturo had found a problem to solve.\n“Come,” Betheth said, putting his arm on Szeth’s shoulder and steering\nhim away from the other boys. “Let’s talk to the camp’s general, Szeth. You\nmight find a better home in officer training.”\nIt is to this end that I have identified and made particular note of\nthree distinct factions of Skybreakers, even during Nale’Elin’s\ndays of direct leadership, and this is to be found in my third coda.\n—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 2\nNoura the vizier left the tent the moment Adolin arrived with his armorers.\nShe gave him one quick look, her lips downturned, then she was gone.\nAdolin had to assume she’d spent time trying to persuade Yanagawn not to\ngo forward with battle training. However, the young monarch stood and\nsmiled, then quickly waved Adolin forward.\nThey had no idea what they were getting in him, Adolin thought. A\ncomplete wildcard. Elevating a pauper to emperor. It’s like something from\none of the old stories.\n“You’ll really let me wear it?” Yanagawn said, cooing over the armor.\n“I lend it to my armor standbys all the time,” Adolin said. “Plus, it\nshouldn’t be needed for the next hour or so.”\nYanagawn rubbed his hands, eyes wide and mischievous, hat with its\nlong sweeping sides waggling as he moved. “Let’s do it!”\n“Let’s clear some space then,” Adolin said. The large tent was cluttered\nwith furnishings, from rugs to couches, to tables piled with glass, gold, and\naluminum. Bowls, sphere goblets, portraits of the Herald Jezrien—painted\nin Azir as a regal Makabaki.\n“There’s space over here,” Yanagawn said, hurrying to an open section\nof carpet.\n“Excellency,” Adolin said, “that’s not nearly enough space for a man\nwearing Plate for the first time. If you value any of this stuff, I suggest you\nhave it cleared away. Trust me.”\n“Oh!” Yanagawn clapped and pointed, and servants appeared and got to\nit.\nAdolin would have preferred to do this out in the square, but his gut said\nthat would be pushing too far. Some of the guards seemed to have swapped\nout the moment Adolin arrived. So, only the most trusted guards and\nYanagawn’s close servants were in the tent. They could … pretend not to\nsee him going so far against tradition. Parading him out before the entire\narmy and city would be another thing entirely. A man’s first time in Plate\ncould be a little awkward, even if Zahel wasn’t around to make you jump\noff buildings onto your head.\n“So …” Yanagawn said, glancing down at his ornate robes.

When he\nstretched his arms out to the sides, layers of cloth strung like wings between\nhis arms and torso. His robes weren’t divided, and his headdress was …\nwell, roughly the size of a small cottage.\n“You’ll need to change,” Adolin said, waving to Geb.\nThe head armorer tossed the emperor a thick gambeson and padded hose\nfor wearing underneath Plate. “This should fit.”\n“Excellent,” Yanagawn said, pointing to them all. “I dub these men\nchosen for the day, granted leave of viewership, blessed by my imperial\npresence.”\n“Um … thanks?” Adolin asked.\n“It means,” an Azish soldier whispered, “that you are allowed in the\ngreat Prime’s presence during intimate times. A blessing bestowed upon a\ncertain number of common people every day, in order that they might\nexperience his majesty and participate in our governance.”\nAdolin looked to the one who had spoken—a man with short black hair.\nHe had the most impressive mustache, bushy and thick. It went out more\nthan it did down.\n“Thanks,” Adolin said, then hesitated as the emperor’s clothiers began\nstripping him. “Uh … should we go?”\n“Didn’t you hear what I said?” the soldier said. “You’re blessed. I mean,\nhe did it for convenience, it appears—but who would question the Prime’s\ndecisions?” He winked.\n“Ah,” Adolin said. “I think my father talked about this. People watch\nhim sleep at night, right?”\n“And eat. And bathe. And everything else. The emperor is a symbol of\nthe health of our nation.”\nWhat an odd people. Talking directly to Yanagawn was seen as insulting\n—but he’d strip in front of strangers?\n“They say you’re good at towers,” the friendly guard said.\n“I’ve been known to play a game now and then,” Adolin said, leaning\nback against a sofa that had been upended to make room.\n“What variety?”\n“Flat Face,” Adolin said.\nThe guard nodded. He held his formal pose, carrying an impressive\nAzish ceremonial polearm. “The best for strategic planning. But it is a little\nmundane.”\n“Mundane?” Adolin asked. “It’s a classic. You prefer Stacks?”\n“Yaezir, no!” the man said. “Deliverer is my favorite. If not Vanquish.”\n“Heard of both. Never tried them.” Adolin had never figured out why\nthere were so many variants on the rule set of such a simple game.\n“You should try sometime,” the guard said. “Both are good preparations\nfor the actual interesting variations, like Crosswise Chull or Bubbly Belch.”\nAdolin eyed him. Surely those were made up. The guard kept his pose,\nstaring straight forward, a smile on his lips. Soon Yanagawn was ready, and\nthe armorers approached with the Plate. Geb glanced at Adolin, who\nnodded, and then they started suiting up the emperor.\nYanagawn looked so much more ordinary in the training clothing—less\nlike a … flower arrangement at a funeral, more like a person.

Now people watched him bathe,\nwhile others literally dressed and fed him.\nEvery man needed a chance to stand tall and learn he could withstand a\npunch. Or … well, maybe not every man. Renarin would probably explain\nthat there were very few things every man needed, whatever society said,\nand Adolin did try to listen.\nI hope you’re well, Renarin, Adolin thought. Once, he could always\ncount on Renarin being nearby—but now he was Radiant, and although he\nwasn’t a Windrunner, he was learning to fly. While Adolin just kept going\nas he always had. Same old Adolin.\n“I’d always heard,” Yanagawn said, staring at his booted feet, “that Plate\nresizes to the individual. I hadn’t imagined it would be so comfortable\nthough.” Awespren gathered around him—blue smoke rings—and hovered\nas the armorers locked on each new piece, which indeed resized. Mostly.\nThe breastplate and greaves were both a little long on him, and he’d be\nbetter off with a deliberate resizing. You could shatter a piece, then regrow\nit on someone, to get a more exact fit.\nThis was close enough for now. Adolin watched with pleasure as the arm\npieces locked in, then Geb handed Yanagawn the helmet. He slid it on, and\nit sealed in place. Storms, but Adolin could remember the first time he’d put\non Plate. That electric sense of power, that strength, that feeling of\ninvulnerability. He waved to Geb, who—with his assistants—dragged in a\nfew practice dummies.\n“Have at it,” Adolin said to the emperor.\n“It?”\nAdolin nodded to the dummies. “Pretend they wrote a really terrible\nessay, full of …” What made an essay bad? “… Poetry?”\n“Huh?” Geb asked. “Poetry?”\n“There’s prose and poetry,” Adolin said. “They’re opposites or\nsomething; my wife talked about it. So if you tried to write an essay and\nfilled it with poetry, you’ve failed, right?”\nThe friendly guard from earlier was snickering. Yanagawn, however,\ntried to attack the training dummies. He launched forward with too eager a\nstep though, and the Plate’s inherent strength sent him stumbling until he\nfell on his face.\nThe guards immediately moved to help.\n“Stop!” Adolin said, hands out to block them. “You want to get\nyourselves killed?”\n“But—” the friendly guard said.\n“He’s fine,” Adolin said. “Aren’t you, Excellency?”\nYanagawn was laughing as he climbed to his hands and knees. “That’s\namazing!” he said. “Amazing! Even my steps are stronger. How high could\nI jump?”\n“I’d suggest you try,” Adolin said, with a smile, “but you’d probably\ntopple the tent when you hit the roof. Take it easy as you stand up,\nExcellency.”\nGeb’s men were ready with hooks to steer Yanagawn if he strayed too\nclose to anyone.

        "text": "close to anyone. A Shardbearer first using his Plate could be dangerous—as\nevidenced when Yanagawn stood up and swung his arms to the sides to\nbalance. Those sweeps of armored hands could throw a man across the\nroom.\nFortunately, Geb and his men had done this many times. They carefully\nsteered some servants away, giving the emperor plenty of space to practice\nwalking. He got that part quickly; most people did. Finally he approached\nthe dummies, and with joyspren swirling around his arms, punched each\ndummy in turn, blasting them to splinters and shards.\n“That is,” Yanagawn said, his voice echoing in his helm, “the single most\nsatisfying thing I’ve ever done.”\n“Great,” Adolin said as Geb handed him some wooden training eggs.\n“Here, catch these.”\nYanagawn turned, and managed not to stumble as he located Adolin,\nwho carefully threw one of the wooden eggs across the room. They were\nexactly the right size to grip in the hand, three inches across, and though\nYanagawn missed the first two, he caught the third.\nAnd immediately smashed it while trying to hold it.\n“Wow,” the emperor said.\n“Wearing Plate,” Adolin said, “isn’t so much about learning how to do\ndamage. That part is easy. Learning not to break everything? Well that takes\npractice. Once you can learn to direct your force, you truly become\ndangerous.”\nHe tossed Yanagawn another sphere, which the emperor caught—then\ncrushed.\n“That’s so difficult!” the younger man said, as if both delighted and\nsurprised.\nAdolin smiled, and nodded for Geb to give some practical instructions\naccompanied by simple exercises. Yanagawn took to it with eagerness as\nAdolin settled on a chair stacked on another one, while Donalar—an officer\nwith light blue eyes who was the third generation of that name in the Cobalt\nGuard—arrived to tell him there was still no movement from the enemy.\nHis meal was ready—merely some chouta in a wrap, to keep him on the\nmove. He ate, wishing Shallan were here. They often ate together, ignoring\nproprieties of gendered dining. He missed the quips, the silliness mixed\nwith truly poignant questions about his day, his feelings, his choices.\nThe guard from before, the one with the bristly mustache, watched\nYanagawn with interest. “You want to take a turn?” Adolin asked him\naround a bite of chouta.\n“I’ve trained on one of the imperial sets,” the man said. “Most of the\nguards have. Just in case.”\nMade sense. As Kaminah was learning her job quickly—and had sent\nhim several chouta wraps, with the implication he needed to keep eating—\nhe held up one to the guard. “Want some?”\n“No eating on watch,” he said, his eyes on the emperor. “Aren’t you\ngoing to teach him towers?”\n“Planning to once he can sit down without falling over,” Adolin said.\n“He’s a quick learner though. Hey, Excellency!”\nYanagawn turned, curious.\n“Come and sit,” Adolin said, pointing. “We’ll start your tactical\ntraining.”\n“While wearing Plate?” the emperor asked."

Adolin grabbed a low table—designed for use while sitting on the\nground—and hauled it in front of Yanagawn. Then he turned to the friendly\nguard.\n“You’ve got a deck?” he asked the man.\n“Why assume I carry one on me?”\n“You seem the type.”\nThe man grinned, then fished one out of the pouch at his side, all while\nkeeping at alert attention.\n“I hope,” Adolin said, settling himself at the table, “you don’t lose too\nmuch of your weekly wages at cards.”\n“Lose?” the man said from behind. “Not sure I know that word,\nforeigner. Must be an Alethi thing.”\nAdolin chuckled, shuffling the large cards. “Is he always this\nentertaining?”\n“He … isn’t allowed to talk to me,” Yanagawn admitted.\nOh, right. “Is that hard?”\n“The hardest part, Adolin. Harder than being a spectacle. Harder by far\nthan my lessons. It’s the only thing I truly miss from the old days.”\nAdolin leaned across the small table. “Next time we’re in Urithiru, I’ll\nhave Shallan make an illusory decoy for you to entertain the scribes. We’ll\nsneak you out for a night—go to some winehouses, play some cards, hit a\nparty.”\n“Ha!” Yanagawn said. Then after a moment said, “Wait. That wasn’t a\njoke.”\n“Storming right it wasn’t a joke; it was a promise.” Adolin held up the\ndeck. “You’ve really never played?”\n“No,” Yanagawn said. “My uncle never let me play any card games. Said\nI’d lose my shoes, then his shoes.”\n“Well,” Adolin said, “towers is versatile, but I’m going to teach you a\nversion called Flat Face. Not because you have to keep from laughing—but\nbecause each card does exactly what the glyphs indicate.”\n“There are versions where that isn’t the case?”\n“Most of them, in fact,” Adolin said. “I’m going to give you cards,\nwhich you should hide from me. You can look at your hand, and you deploy\ncards as armies on the table. Maneuver your troops, change their capacities\naccording to the armies you deploy next to them. Choose when to attack,\nwhen to retreat a card back to your hand. The winner is whoever eliminates\nall opposing cards—or who forces his opponent to give up.”\n“Why would you ever give up?” Yanagawn asked. “Why not fight until\nyou’re beaten?”\n“That is an excellent question,” Adolin said. “Often in towers you try for\nbest of three—and you can permanently lose cards in earlier skirmishes.\nMany versions require betting, and the more you commit, the higher the\nbets.”\n“So … you would retreat if you want to preserve your cards for the next"

Correct?”\nAdolin smiled. “You are going to be the best student I’ve ever had,\nExcellency.”\nYanagawn nodded his helmeted head. Then he carefully reached up and\ntook the helm off. He set it to the side, deeply considering something. Was\nit the cards?\n“Would it be all right,” the emperor asked softly, “if I asked you to call\nme by my name?” He met Adolin’s eyes. “It will give the viziers heart\nattacks though. I don’t want to cause you trouble.”\n“Yanagawn,” Adolin said, dealing the cards, “I’ve been breaking the\nhearts of scribes since I was fourteen. I’ll manage. You ready?”\n“Yes. Absolutely!”\nKaladin finished making the evening stew. He and Szeth had flown much of\nthe distance to the next monastery, where they hoped to find more answers.\nBut going in at night didn’t sound wise. Kaladin was eager to be moving\nforward, but at the same time, rushing seemed wrong. He feared pushing\nSzeth too much. Pushing himself too much … well, he’d learned how\ndangerous that could be. So as the stew cooked—smelling almost\nacceptable now that he had some fresh peppers—Kaladin decided to\npractice the flute.\nIt was strange, to be sitting near this gurgling river in the night,\nsurrounded by empty grasslands, simply playing. His life since reaching\nadulthood—before it, really—had been a nonstop sprint. Event after event,\nalmost every one a disaster. He’d stopped only when forced to rest.\nNow something peaceful within him wanted to call to mind their faces.\nFriends he’d lost. Friends whose fates he didn’t know. Women he’d loved.\nOthers who had loved him. Never the two intersecting, as was the perverse\nway of his life.\nHe remembered nights as a slave, trembling and huddled by the wall.\nOther nights planning, letting himself build idealistic dreams of freedom.\nHe remembered nights around the stewpot with Bridge Four, and others\ntrying to stay awake on guard duty. He remembered, as a blur, those broken\ndays after the fall of Kholinar when it had all caught up to him.\nHe remembered a beautiful woman made of blue light, standing with a\nbrilliant sword and cutting through the darkness as death itself came\ncrawling for him in the shape of a thousand spined monsters. And he\nremembered his father’s embrace at the end of a long black tunnel.\nThrough it all, he played his flute. Poorly. The notes just wouldn’t form\nright, and his fingers felt like they were made of stone. He tried again and\nagain. He’d learned the spear. He’d learned to face the darkness of his\nmind. He could learn to control this simple piece of wood.\nYet it resisted him with all the might of Bridge Four combined. More\nstubborn than any slave or lighteyes."

Listening isn’t painful anymore!”\nHe gave her a flat stare.\n“Listening isn’t agonizingly painful anymore!” she said.\nKaladin sighed and gazed out to a tall hillside, where Szeth stood in front\nof the first moon, inspecting the landscape. “I keep thinking about how Wit\nmade this flute play music back to him.”\n“Yeah,” she said. “The story of the Wandersail. When he played it, the\nechoes of it bouncing around in the chasms continued afterward.”\n“I always wondered why he told me that story. The story about a people\nwho followed a king who was, in the top of his tower, dead. About a people\nwho learned their actions were their own responsibility. Seems odd, doesn’t\nit? I already knew that the lighteyes weren’t as valorous as they claimed,\nand that my actions were my own.”\n“Maybe it wasn’t about the lighteyes,” she said, “but other forces you let\nsteer you.”\nKaladin nodded. “It was surreal. Wit would stop playing, then the music\nwould return, continuing as he talked.” He looked at the flute. “Before we\nleft Urithiru, he implied that would happen for me. When I learned to play it\nnot with my lips, but with my heart. I can’t fathom what that might mean.”\n“He can be frustrating,” Syl said. “If the world survives this, I’ll see if I\ncan hide something extra annoying in his sock drawer.” She smiled, but\nthen put her hand on his knee. “You … all right?”\n“I’m fine,” he promised. “Just thinking. When I needed him, Wit was\nalways there. But he told me I would have to make my own story this time.”\nHe shrugged. “When the darkness consumed me, he pulled me free. So\nmaybe I can listen to him today.”\n“That’s a remarkably mature perspective,” Syl said. “I feel a little silly\nabout the sock drawer wisecrack now.”\nKaladin merely smiled as Szeth strode back to them. “That next town is\nvery clearly corrupted,” the man said. “They hid inside all day, but are out\nnow at night. Some are working the fields, but many are moving in the\ndarkness toward Koring, the town where people are normal. Likely to try\nbreaking in.”\n“Should we help?” Kaladin asked.\n“Koring survived two years,” Szeth said. “They can rebuff another\nassault, particularly now that they don’t have to worry about any attacks\nfrom the Encilo region.” He knelt beside the small fire and tasted the stew.\nHe grunted.\n“Better?” Kaladin asked.\n“Your Eastern ways have corrupted my sense of taste,” Szeth said. “I\nshouldn’t enjoy this much pepper.”\nStorms, but that man knew how to backhand a compliment.

Dedicating everything he had to helping Szeth. Should he stop\nhelping? That couldn’t be the right answer.\nAt Syl’s urging, he got out their copy of The Way of Kings, so she could\nread him a chapter, with him turning the pages. After that, she—\nconcentrating earnestly—wrote out their daily report to send home via\nspanreed, which Szeth commonly did. Today he seemed focused on his\nmeal and thoughts, so Kaladin—somewhat grudgingly—took the spanreed\npen and traced her words.\n“It’s not writing to copy writing!” Syl insisted.\n“Feels like writing,” Kaladin grumbled.\nShe watched him work by the light of a sphere, beaming. Her joy at\nbeing able to scribe infected him, and he ended up not minding so much.\n“How are you doing?” he asked her as he worked, lying on the ground\nwith the spanreed board before him, tracing through a very thin piece of\npaper what she’d written beneath. “About your goals.”\n“Not living just for you?” she said.\n“Yeah,” Kaladin whispered. “Because I’m having a storming hard time\nfiguring out how to both help people and not help people all at once.”\n“You just need to live for yourself. That’s what the flute was about,\nwasn’t it?”\n“I can’t be certain,” he said, “that I’m not doing that to please Wit.\nWould I ever have chosen that on my own?”\n“Would I ever have chosen to write on my own?” she asked, leaning\ndown beside him. “But I did, and I love it.” She whispered to him, “I’m\nkeeping a journal. It’s private and I’m doing it.”\nHe looked up at her smile.\n“I returned to the Physical Realm,” she told him, “because I enjoy it\nhere. I like the wind, the colors, the infinite blue sky and the warm close\nsun. I like the Radiant bond, because I like participating. I remind myself of\nthat. I’m a person, and I chose.”\n“Rule number one,” Kaladin whispered.\n“Exactly. What about you? Are you a thing, Kaladin, or a person? Do\nyou move merely because your instincts tell you, or do you choose to\nhelp?”\n“Both, sometimes,” he admitted. “Like with Bridge Four, in the early\ndays. I had this … mental need to help, so when I failed, it broke me. Even\nmore than the loss of a dear friend should have, because I was so defined by\nthe idea of protecting others.” He finished writing and changed the paper, in\ncase a message came for them. “Still, I genuinely want to help.”\n“Rough,” Syl said quietly. “Because, like me, the problem you and the\nreal you are all mixed up together.”"

The\nancient spren of Roshar, predating humans and even singers.”\n“The Wind said that she couldn’t speak until recently,” Kaladin said.\n“Something about Odium, and maybe how people perceived her.”\n“Emotion spren and windspren came from the Old Magic,” Syl said.\n“Before humans were here, or the ten groups of Radiant spren were created.\nI think the oldest spren must all be mostly forgotten. Overwhelmed,\ncrowded out, like whispers in a room full of shouting people. The Night.\nThe Stone. And the Wind. They’re ancient. Older than the gods …”\nThe spanreed started writing. A short message directly from Wit, which\nSyl read. Wit was apparently still covering for the Bondsmiths while they\nsearched for answers in the Spiritual Realm. But he “totally had it handled”\nand “no one should worry at all.” Which was, of course, worrying. Fighting\nhad started with the Fused at the Shattered Plains, but there were no\ncasualties among Bridge Four. Adolin was holding Azimir. Jasnah would\nleave for Thaylen City soon, though enemy forces weren’t expected there\nfor a few days yet.\nKaladin was tempted to write back and demand help with his personal\nproblems. But Wit ended with, “Write your story. Listen to the Wind.”\nStorming man. He knew.\nKaladin leaned back and attempted to listen to the Wind now. He found\nonly the sound of the leaves and the brook chattering away. He closed his\neyes, trying to remember the last time he’d done something that had been\npurely for him, purely peaceful. If he could be doing anything at that\nmoment, what would it be? What would make him happy? He let himself\nanswer truthfully.\nHe wanted to go dancing with Syl.\n“Hey,” he said to her, “feel like a kata?”\n“Sure,” she said, perking up."

He tossed off his jacket, and didn’t let it bother him that if\nhe worked up a sweat, he’d need to do extra laundry in that stream the next\nday.\nFor now, he just wanted to be like those ancient spren. Exist as the\nsimplest version of himself: with a spear in hand.\nHe fell into a stance, and as soon as he snapped into position, Syl\nvanished from her human form and came to him, dropping into his hand as\na long, silvery spear. One kata alone felt appropriate, the one they called the\nChasm Kata. That training dance he’d done so long ago, the first time he’d\nshown Bridge Four what he could do.\nFor a time after that, he’d refused to wield a weapon. Using a pole with\nno spearhead instead had freed him. Likewise, Syl … she wasn’t a weapon.\nNot tonight. A living Shardblade could take whatever shape you wanted,\nand today the shape was of a spear—but not a weapon.\nTonight, his dance wasn’t about killing, or even about training. It was\nabout the kata, and his love for what he’d learned. He spun the spear,\nadding in every flourish he knew, the kinds that would get you killed on a\nbattlefield—but that didn’t matter. Because he wasn’t on a battlefield, and\nthis wasn’t a weapon.\nSyl was a glowing silvery arc in his hands as he moved through the\nsequence. Each step sure, each grip perfect, stretching and straining his\nmuscles. Just because it wasn’t practical didn’t mean it wasn’t difficult. He\nspun, whipping the spear into attacks. Then—as he leaned forward,\nthrusting the spear in a long one-handed lunge—the shape of it fuzzed, and\nhe was holding her hand.\nHe spun Syl, her skirt flaring as he moved through the next step of the\nkata. He’d never learned to dance, not properly. Tarah had laughed when\nshe’d found out, and so he’d never told anyone else. When would stern\nKaladin Stormblessed ever have time for dancing? He was too busy saving\nthe world.\nThis was different. This he could do, because there was no wrong way.\nHe merely had to do what felt right. He spun with Syl, then yanked her\nback, spear landing securely in his left hand as he added steps to the kata.\nThe springy ground seemed to propel his spins, as if he were light as air. He\nwhipped the spear to the side and Syl unfolded, rotating in a spin, her hand\nin his. Faintly touching.\nA part of him wanted to feel foolish. Wanted to worry about tomorrow,\nwhen Szeth would have to face an Elsecaller, with powers nearly as arcane\nas those of a Bondsmith. Should he be planning for that? Kaladin almost\nstopped.\nThen he remembered what he’d said to Szeth about warrior thoughts.\nCould he honestly help Szeth if he wasn’t willing to do the same himself?\nDid he truly believe those practices would work?

Kaladin took a deep\nbreath, then battered back those emotions, presenting counterthoughts like\nparts of the kata. Syl formed into a spear as he spun, then he used the\nmomentum to launch the weapon—throwing it in a glowing silver line\ndirectly through a nearby tree trunk.\nI deserve peace.\nThe spear formed in his hand again, but then was Syl, laughing as they\ndanced.\nI deserve to be happy.\nHe tossed her as a spear from one hand, then caught her as a woman—\nSyl choosing when to be which, but him sensing each change. They turned,\nwhirling, two hands holding two hands.\nI will enjoy this. I will let myself enjoy living.\nThe darkness didn’t die, but it retreated as all darkness did before light.\nAnd as they twirled, Syl’s laughter calling to the sky, the Wind arrived and\nbegan dancing with them. The Wind began moving them both. Pushing him\nthis way, then that. A swirling, gusting, powerful force. Alive, guiding his\nsteps.\nI remember this, Kaladin thought. From my childhood. I remember\nmoving, and the Wind joining me. I remember … peace and freedom.\nHe danced through it, and Syl danced with him, both riding the eddies of\nthe Wind. And if he’d ever known a perfect moment in his life—crystallized\njoy, like light made into something you could hold—this was it. Worries\nabandoned. No, worries battered away. Worries refused.\nIn that—at the edge of the world and the advent of the end of all things\n—Kaladin Stormblessed allowed himself to be happy. For what felt like the\nfirst time since Tien’s death.\nHe came to the end of the dance, dipping low, holding Syl as a spear,\nthen a woman, then as pure light. Distant thunder. Wind that continued to\ngust around them.\nFollowed by sound. From the flute.\nKaladin spun, and then—Syl at his side as a woman—ran for it. He\ngrabbed the flute and held it as the swirling Wind blew across the holes,\nsending out fitful half-sounds. He drew that Wind in, and felt it churning\nwithin him, like Stormlight energizing his lungs. He blew. The note: pure\nand clean.\nHe played then. Not perfectly. Far from it. He was new to this, but like\nthe kata, he didn’t bother with what he should be doing. He played what felt\nright; what came next. The music that Wit had left him to learn—the song\nof the Wandersail—provided a framework, a backbone, as Kaladin played.\nSome notes strong, others faltering, but growing better with each repetition.\nHe wanted this. He wanted it because this was a challenge, something to\nlearn, something different. Stuffy, grumpy Kaladin. He didn’t have time for\nmusic or love or life. That was the story.

Of a man who had time for music. He found in it some piece of his\nsoul that had always been missing, a loss he’d never had words to explain.\nHe learned a new language that night, full of new adjectives for who\nKaladin was, and who he could be.\nHe finished, and the Wind rushed away, carrying the last notes into the\nnight. The sounds didn’t return to him, but the Wind did seem to keep hold\nof them for safekeeping. He looked at Syl, whose smile was made of light,\nand he grinned. He let himself grin. Happiness was a part of what defined\nKaladin.\nHe lingered on her face, kept worries at bay with a shield wall of\nproactive thoughts, for a remarkable length of time, until finally he turned\nto see what Szeth thought of the music.\nThe man was not there. He’d left the stump where he’d been eating. The\nsky was empty of him, though his pack—including the two Honorblades\nand Nightblood—lay near the fire.\n“Huh,” Kaladin said. “Did you see where he went?”\nYanagawn indeed proved an extremely capable student, picking up the\ngame quickly. Moreover, he appeared to have a sixth sense for the\nbattlefield lessons each of the early training scenarios were meant to\ninstruct.\n“So,” Yanagawn said, “it really is worse to deploy everything at once,\nwith nothing in reserve. While it makes a show of force, which sounds most\nlikely to win, your mistakes magnify—and you don’t have any flexibility to\nreset if things get out of hand.”\n“Exactly!” Adolin said, chewing on his second roll of chouta, as he knew\nhe’d be chastised otherwise. He tapped the table in front of them—which\nwas now cracked after Yanagawn had placed a card too forcefully and split\nthe wood. After that they’d removed the Plate, leaving the emperor in a\nwarrior’s gambeson with a robe over the top. “Plus, you need reserves to be\nable to counter your opponent, and you need to be able to play to the terrain\nif the battlefield moves.”\n“Or,” Yanagawn said, studying the board, “a company you thought\nstrong might have a bad break and flounder. If you’ve committed\neverything, the way I just did, you can’t shore up weak points.”\n“Excellent. Now, other than that, why did you lose?”\n“You were able to surround me,” he replied, “and a surrounded army is\nweaker.”\n“It can’t rest its troops in back lines as effectively,” Adolin said, “and has\nto waste energy watching its flanks, then fighting on them. So you got\nsurrounded—and then were so overly committed that you didn’t have any\nreserves to break through and rescue your troops.”\nYanagawn nodded, then eyed a large upright clock. “You have to go,\ndon’t you?”\n“Afraid so,” Adolin said. “I’m on duty—and the enemy is very likely to\nattack soon.”\n“I’d love to know how you figured that out,” Yanagawn replied. “Can I\nlearn it from cards?”"

We’ll get you there.” He then held out his\nhand.\nYanagawn hesitantly took it. A few of the servants gasped, but Adolin\nignored them.\n“It’s tradition,” Adolin said, “to give a handshake across the table after a\ngame. One last lesson for tonight: Don’t ever get mad at a person you’re\nsparring with, especially when they defeat you. Their victory is training for\nyou. More importantly, you need to be the kind of person the best duelists\nwant to fight—because if you only ever face people you can beat, then\nyou’ll never improve.”\n“Thank you,” Yanagawn said, standing up. “For all of it, Adolin.” He\npaused. “How is it you’re not Radiant?”\nAdolin covered a wince. That question.\nThat storming question.\n“Everyone says you’re the best fighter in the army,” Yanagawn\ncontinued. “And everyone loves you.”\n“I wish that were true, Yanagawn. I can think of quite a few who don’t.”\n“Regardless. Why?”\n“I …” One factor was that he would not abandon Maya, and becoming\nRadiant would require that, he’d been told. But beyond that … “I don’t like\nthe oaths,” Adolin admitted. Voicing it for the first time.\n“What?” Yanagawn said. “I thought good Vorin people were all about\noaths.”\nAdolin shrugged, rising. “My father made oaths, and so did all the\nhighprinces, before the Radiants were refounded—back when they were all\nburning down villages and slaughtering people. Their actions were\nconsidered honorable because they kept their storming oaths. Who cares\nabout the suffering they caused, right? Everyone was honorable! That’s\nwhat matters!”\nYanagawn, instead of being taken aback by the rising angerspren at\nAdolin’s feet, pondered this with a solemn expression.\n“Too many people,” Adolin said as his armorers began to put on his\nPlate, “think the oath, and not what it means, is the important part. I heard\nsomething in one of my lessons once, from an ardent. About a man who\ntook an oath to sit in a chair until told he could stand—and he stayed there\nfor ten years.”\n“Wow,” Yanagawn said. “That’s impressive.”\n“It’s idiocy,” Adolin said. “Pardon, Yanagawn—everyone celebrated\nhim, but it’s pure idiocy. You know what I’d admire? A man who gave an\noath, then realized it was storming stupid and broke it—apologized—and\nmoved on with his life, determined not to make that kind of mistake again.”\n“Some might call that hypocrisy.”\n“No, it would just be—”\nAdolin cut off. Sometimes a hypocrite is just a man in the process of\nchanging. Storming Dalinar Kholin had written that in his storming book.\nPeople quoted it all the time.\nDalinar was always there, everywhere Adolin looked."

Merely two men\ndoing their best.”\nAdolin nodded, then leaned forward—his lower half now armored—and\nthumbed over his shoulder. “That fellow with the mustache. Who is he?”\n“Commandant’s son,” Yanagawn whispered. “Gezamal.”\n“Good to know,” Adolin whispered. But before he could say more, the\nThaylen man—Hmask—was announced at the tent. He waved to Adolin,\ncarrying a letter from one of the scribes.\nAdolin didn’t need it. He could hear the distant shouts. The enemy had\narrived, exactly as predicted. He held out his arms, and the armorers\nhurriedly finished suiting him up.\nI wish not to engage to the reader their faults, rather to make it\nclear that an order so determined to care for the unwanted, the\nunguarded, and the disenfranchised would obviously have\npassionate disagreement in how to best attend to the needs of the\nlowly and disregarded.\n—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 2\nSzeth ate his stew, pondering whether he should tell Kaladin about the\nVoice.\nThat Voice he’d heard as a child, the one he hadn’t heard since leaving\nShinovar. It didn’t seem to be the same as the voices of the dead he now\nheard. Sometimes he wondered if that first Voice had been real—or an early\nmanifestation of his … problems.\nHe’d initially started telling Kaladin his past in order to explain how he\nknew an Unmade was in Shinovar. Only … when reaching the part where\nhe’d first heard the Voice … Szeth had left that out. Even still—as he talked\nto Kaladin about being forced into the military, and training there his first\nfew years—he left out details. No mention of the Voice, little discussion of\nhis family, except his father.\nIt felt like lying. At the same time, some things were personal. With a\nsigh, Szeth set aside his bowl and stood up, stepping forward.\nWhere he immediately fell into the place of shadows.\nThe world of beads and a distant sun. Makari Sin in the old Shin\nwritings. The glasslands. Shadesmar.\nPanic hit as he splashed into the sea of beads. He desperately reached\ntoward the alien sky. He would drown here. Sink into the deep sea of beads,\nfalling, falling, falling until he was forced to inhale a mouthful of glass.\nUntil he died and came to rest on the obsidian ocean floor. An open-eyed\neternal corpse that lore claimed would never rot, staring at an abyss that\nwould never stare back, despite its million million beaded eyes.\nDeath didn’t frighten him, but he had to finish his quest before he went,\nand so he fought through the panic. He stopped thrashing as he sank in the\nbeads, their insectile clacking ceaseless as they rolled over one another. He\nwas not powerless here. He’d survived this place during training long ago,\nand he could do so again."

He’d survived this place during training long ago,\nand he could do so again.\nHe fished in the pouch at his waist and brought forth a gemstone full of\nStormlight. He drew in the tiniest amount—sucking air between his teeth,\nbeads pressing against his lips as if eager to find their way into his throat.\nHe almost Lashed himself upward. But he was here, in this place. Why?\nInstead he focused, imagining a shape in his mind. A pillar. A solid pillar\nupon which he could stand. Certain orders of Knights Radiant had an\naffinity for this place, but Skybreakers were not one of them. Fortunately,\nanyone with Stormlight—including those who weren’t Radiant—could\ncommand the beads.\nThe sea beneath him began to solidify. Beads clicked together, sticking\nas if magnetized, and pushed upward. A few seconds later he broke through\nthe surface—beads rolling free of his platform. He stumbled to his feet,\nbeads dripping from his clothing, and found himself upon what amounted to\na small raft.\nKeeping it cohesive was difficult. He had to concentrate, and despite that\nhis platform undulated beneath his feet as if held together by the most\ntenuous of bonds. He would never manage any construction more complex\nthan this, not without a model or guide, and he couldn’t draw in too much\nStormlight—for if he did, the nearby beads would surge toward him,\nflooding over the top of the platform. It also might draw the attention of\nvery dangerous spren beasts.\n“So, you remember your training,” a voice said, causing him to spin. A\nstern man sat on a similar platform ten yards away, a Blade across his lap—\nthe Elsecaller Blade, which had an appearance reminiscent of Oathbringer.\nA hooked shape on the end, but flowing lines in an arcing curve. The man\nwas shrouded in black, inky cloth. White hair in tufts, clean shaven across\nthe face, and hands that had seen some years.\nPozen-son-Nash. One of Szeth’s earliest teachers, and a man a part of\nhim still hated. Few individuals had the power to enter Shadesmar, and even\nfewer could bring others. If Szeth was here, it was because of this man—\nbearer of Batlah’s sword.\nSzeth was to have visited Pozen’s monastery next, but the old man had\nplainly decided not to wait.\n“An assassination,” Szeth said, falling into a fighting stance and reaching\nout to summon his Blade. “You ignore the rules of pilgrimage?”\n“No such rules apply,” Pozen said. “You are aspiring to a position no\nman has claimed in thousands of years. Such a lofty goal must come with a\nlofty test.”\n“I seek no position.” Szeth glanced at his hand. Empty. His Shardblade.\nWhere was it?\nOf course. He knelt down on his platform, hearing something shifting\nbelow, thrashing in the beads. With focus, he raised up another small pillar,\nand upon it was a strange figure in the shape of a clothed man. The interior\nof the figure was blackness and stars—like a rip in reality.

It was the way\nhis spren manifested in this realm. Szeth, in his panic, hadn’t seen the spren\nappear. Unfortunately, Honorblades acted differently, as evidenced by the\none across Pozen’s lap.\nWell, perhaps this would be an advantage; Szeth’s spren was an ancient\nwarrior. He might not be able to become a Shardblade in Shadesmar, but he\ncould fight by Szeth’s side. His spren stopped thrashing somewhat\nhesitantly, then looked around—his strange shape seeming to flow more\nthan it moved. As if he were some kind of shadow of a person.\n“Oh,” the spren said. “Oh!”\n“Prepare yourself, Szeth-son-Neturo,” Pozen said, hands on his Blade. “I\ncould have killed you as you fell, but I have given you this chance out of\nwhat may be an overabundance of fondness for a former student.”\n“I have no weapon!” Szeth shouted. “I cannot fight you without one.”\n“Then you do not deserve to win.”\nSomething exploded from the beads to Szeth’s left. A younger Shin\nwoman in grey robes, a bow strapped to her back. She bore the Edgedancer\nHonorblade: a narrow sword almost six feet long, with a curved crossguard.\nShe swiped for Szeth and he Lashed himself backward just in time. His\nspren sputtered and ducked, his hands over his head, although no Shin\nwould dare attack a spren.\nSzeth drew in more Stormlight, making the beads rattle and surge toward\nhim, and took to the sky. He didn’t recognize the newcomer, with that black\ncloud of curls around her head. A newer bearer of the Blade, he suspected,\nhaving been elevated in the years since his exile, to replace Dulo.\nSzeth’s spren yelped and dropped into the beads, as Szeth couldn’t\nmaintain that platform. He started splashing about in an … admittedly\nundignified way. Perhaps the creature would not be as much use in this\nfight as Szeth had hoped.\n“You gang up on me?” Szeth shouted to those below. “Two on one?\nHave you no shame?”\n“Should the mountain feel shame for breaking those who cross it?”\nPozen called. “We are the barrier you must pass, Szeth-son-Neturo.”\n“Why?” Szeth shouted. “Tell me why!”\nOnce, he had never asked why. Strange, how he should be so insistent\nnow. He’d changed, hadn’t he.\nIn response, the Edgedancer removed the bow from her back and began\nlaunching arrows at him.\nSzeth Lashed himself higher in the strange sky with its too-still clouds\nand tiny sun. He could stay out of range easily, but to what end? His\nStormlight would run dry quickly—he had only the pouch of gemstones at\nhis belt.\nHe watched the two figures below, the Edgedancer sinking beneath the\nbeads again. Her order had no specific powers here; he suspected that Pozen\nwas creating platforms so she could concentrate on the fighting.\nMy sole way out, Szeth thought, is to capture Pozen and force him to\nElsegate us home."

However, in the months he’d spent training with Pozen\nas a younger man, he had never managed it. Elsegates were a difficult skill\nto master, and barely a small fraction of those who trained achieved them.\nRegardless, he had to engage the two Honorbearers. Weaponless. On turf\nthey’d chosen. With just one pouchful of Stormlight.\nHis strategizing was interrupted as something dark dove at him from the\nsky. Inky black, shaped vaguely like a skyeel, though many times the size.\nA spren he didn’t recognize, but one that was obviously dangerous. He\nhadn’t spotted it, black against black as it was, but he did manage to Lash\nhimself into a dodge at the last second.\nTeeth flashed white as it tore through the air. Spren could be deadly here,\nparticularly if you didn’t know which emotions were drawing them. He\ngrowled softly as—now that he knew what to look for—he spotted an entire\nflock of them. That Edgedancer with her bow had driven him this direction\non purpose.\nHe dove toward the beads, anticipating an attack. The Edgedancer\npopped up, raised on a pillar created by Pozen, who continued to sit cross-\nlegged in his spot. She loosed a series of arrows in Szeth’s direction, so he\ndropped quickly and hit the beads with a crash. He canceled his Lashings,\nletting him slip beneath the surface.\nHere the whispers were louder. In this realm, was he closer to the souls\nhe’d killed?\nThankfully, his training was coming back to him. He imagined motion,\nwaves of beads bearing him sideways, and it worked—the beads responded.\nWith Stormlight and proper thought, you could swim through the beads,\nwith them pushing you along. His control wouldn’t be as precise as Pozen’s,\nbut it would work. At least, so long as he held a small amount of Stormlight\n—which would also spare him needing to breathe.\nAs he ushered himself through the beads, he heard one voice above the\nothers. A whisper that was stronger.\nSzeth? it said. Szeth?\nHe searched through the beads, and his fingers brushed something. He\nseized it, finding a handful of cloth. He yanked the figure closer.\n“Squire?” his spren said. “Is that you?”\n“Locate me a weapon,” Szeth hissed through closed teeth. In this place,\nyou could summon objects from the real world if you held the bead that\nrepresented their soul. “I cannot read the beads, so you must search them\nfor a weapon. I will distract the enemies while you do so.”\n“I shouldn’t interfere …” the spren said.\n“Then I will die, and you will have no squire,” Szeth snapped, letting go\nand allowing the flowing beads to separate them.

Strangely, his reverence for his spren had\nbegun to wane.\nHe surged through the beads, trying to head vaguely in the direction of a\nsmall river he and Kaladin had seen earlier. It would manifest as solid\nground here, and would perhaps give him terrain to use to his advantage.\nUnfortunately, as he moved, the beads began to pull away from him.\nHe’d been discovered.\nThey formed a tube ten feet in diameter, like a mine shaft from Bavland,\nwhere he’d once been owned. The walls of the large tube hardened, and\nSzeth now scrambled on curved, solid ground. He ran for the open end of\nthe tunnel as—just behind him—the wall crashed open and the Edgedancer\nentered. She skated along the side of the tube, her powers giving her grace\nand speed. Szeth spun and Lashed himself backward to stay ahead of her,\nbut the tube kept extending, beads falling into place.\nThe tube suddenly ended in a wall, which he should have expected. He\nslammed into it and she approached, moving quickly.\nHe canceled his Lashing, crouching as her Blade stabbed straight into the\nwall above him—coming within inches of his head. He ducked and ran\nback through the tube as she stopped with precision, then lunged again. He\ngrunted and set the air alight to distract her—a flash of fire.\nStormlight healed the Edgedancer of the superficial burns as her next\nlunge sliced his cheek before plunging the Blade into the wall of the strange\ntube. That brought her in very close to him, and he grunted, grabbing for\nher arm.\nShe backhanded him, deceptively strong—and when he seized her, her\nskin and clothing became as if coated in grease. Edgedancer. Right. There\nwould be no grappling with her. His fingers slipped free, and the\nEdgedancer slid backward, then sliced at him once more with her Blade.\nHe dodged, barely, but then the tunnel’s beads crumbled beneath his feet,\ndumping him down to his waist before partially resolidifying. Pozen’s\nwork. The Edgedancer sprang forward as Szeth struggled in the beads,\nholding up warding hands, but mostly floundering.\nIn a flash, the Blade cut through his forearms. His fingers went limp,\nlosing all sensation, turning into dead weights on the ends of his arms.\nDesperate, he Lashed himself downward through the beads, sinking to his\nshoulders as the next attack passed over his head. The beads started to\nharden further, trying to trap him in place—but with concentration, he made\nthe closest ones respond to him, not Pozen.\nFree enough to slide out, Szeth Lashed himself straight at the\nEdgedancer. He slammed into her and Lashed her away. She soared\nbackward until his Lashing ran out, then she regained control, shaking\nherself.\nSzeth hovered up into the air of the tunnel, wary, exerting effort and\nconcentration to heal his hands. In the distance, he heard it again. That\nvoice.\nSzeth? I’m here! Use me!\nHis spren? No, the voice was wrong. Not Kaladin either.\nWas that … Nightblood?\nThe Edgedancer watched him, careful.

        "text": "His spren? No, the voice was wrong. Not Kaladin either.\nWas that … Nightblood?\nThe Edgedancer watched him, careful. He had to get out of the tube—it\nwas a clever construction, intended to prevent him from leveraging his\nability to fly while still giving the Edgedancer room to maneuver. Pozen\nmust be nearby, to see inside well enough to have liquefied the beads under\nSzeth alone.\n“They told me you were the best,” the Edgedancer said, gliding forward\nlithely, Blade up and pointed at him. “They told me I’d need to train\nexhaustively to have even a chance against you, Truthless. Yet here you are,\ndefeated.”\nSzeth said nothing. He drew in more of his precious remaining\nStormlight and forced it into his hands. Healing from a cut like this took\nwork. Why was she giving him time to accomplish it?\nBecause she doesn’t know, he realized. They haven’t fought Radiants. He\nremembered well his stark amazement when Kaladin had first healed from\nan Honorblade slice, impossible without living oaths and Radiance. The\nHonorblades were amazing, but they were essentially prototypes, without\nthe … refinement that had come as the Radiants had experimented.\nAn opportunity, then.\n“Perhaps,” the Edgedancer said, “I will instead be allowed your great\nhonor. If I am the one who kills you, do you think they will grant it to me\ninstead?”\n“Grant you what?” Szeth asked, landing in the tunnel. He could hear the\nrolling of the beads outside, but distantly, muffled. He sagged, pretended to\nbe worn out, defeated. Letting her stalk closer. “I don’t know what any of\nyou are talking about.”\n“We were instructed not to say,” she told him. “I wish I had not found\nyou so … disappointing, Truthless.”\n“I am but one man,” he said. “Training and skill cannot overcome all\nthings. You have trapped me, weaponless, in an unstable location and have\npitted me two against one. What did you expect?”\n“Brilliance,” she whispered, then lunged for him.\nSzeth, in turn, raised fully healed hands and—with two fingers—pushed\nthe tip of the sword aside. He stepped into her lunge—the sword passing\njust by him—and raised his other fist in a punch, slamming it into her\nstomach.\n“I’m not Truthless,” he growled.\nShe gasped, eyes going wide, and he clocked her across the face with\nanother fist. Then he brought his elbow down on her wrist to disarm her.\nThe Honorblade vanished as she let go, but his next punch missed as the\ntunnel began to undulate and the stunned Edgedancer was dropped into the\nbeads to protect her.\nHe sighed, and a second later the tunnel collapsed into a crushing,\nchurning mass of beads. Fortunately, he was able to control the flow of it;\nPozen couldn’t completely trap him, not so long as Szeth knew to command\nthe beads closest to him.\nAs he swam to hide, he felt cloth in the beads.

        "text": "thrust a bead into his palm. “The best I could do!”\nSzeth pressed Stormlight into the bead, eager for the weapon the spren\nhad found. Here, he did what was called “manifesting.” Using the soul of an\nobject, and Stormlight, to create a physical representation of the item in\nShadesmar.\nHe felt the object form as he made a surge of beads to lift him up toward\nthe surface. There, he saw what he’d been given.\nA spoon. A wide wooden stirring spoon, as was commonly used in\nShinovar for cooking.\nHis spren, appearing far from distinguished as his strange head bobbed\nup from the beads nearby, waved. Close beyond him, Szeth spotted the\npeninsula of firm obsidian ground that followed the river in the Physical\nRealm.\n“A spoon?” Szeth shouted. “The best you could find was a spoon?”\n“You’re inventive!” the spren called back. “I figured you could find\nsomething to do with it!”\nYes, Szeth did find something to do with the spoon. He threw it at the\nspren, hitting him square in the forehead. Then, with a sigh, Szeth let\nhimself sink into the beads again. Weak hope though it was, if he stayed\nsubmerged, he might be able to hide.\nSzeth commanded the currents of beads to swing him toward that ridge\nof land. He wanted his back to that wall, even underneath the beads—as it\nwould at least protect him from one direction. Plus, he was running low on\nStormlight. The moment his reserves failed, he’d quickly suffocate unless\nhe had land to climb upon.\nIt was an unusual experience, flowing through the beads, feeling them\nroll off his face. If he opened his eyes, they’d press against his eyeballs,\nstinging. Each bead glimmered faintly with a spark deep within. They made\nway for him at first … but then started working against him.\nPozen had located him. The beads, rather than ushering Szeth forward,\nbegan to swirl and churn around him. Pozen couldn’t capture Szeth in them,\nbut he could send rival currents to smash into Szeth. Those threw him off\ncourse, as if he were flying through a highstorm.\nSzeth soon lost control. It had been too many years since his training,\nand he’d never been particularly skilled in Shadesmar anyway. Wave after\nwave of beads crashed across him, spinning him, battering him. One finally\nslammed him up against something hard—the ridge he’d been swimming\ntoward.\nHe let out a grunt of pain. The beads—as if sensing his weakness—\nsucked him away from the wall, then crashed him back into it. This time he\nscreamed, glowing Stormlight escaping his lips as his ribs were cracked.\nHis remaining Light rushed to heal him, but at this rate he’d run out in\nminutes.\nSzeth, Nightblood said in his mind—cutting through the whispers like a\nblade. I’m here!\n“Where?” Szeth said.\nI sank and hit something hard. By a wall, I think.\nCould it be? Szeth, using his small reserve of Stormlight, Lashed himself\ndownward. A force strong enough to rip him out of the currents. He sank\nsome hundred feet, and it grew even darker in these depths, the voices\nlouder."

He sank\nsome hundred feet, and it grew even darker in these depths, the voices\nlouder.\nBut … he thought he could see light? He searched for it, and as he\nthrashed in the beads, his hand fell on something. He seized it. A hilt.\nYes! You found me!\n“Why is your voice different?”\nThe sword shouldn’t manifest as a weapon in here, should it?\nShardblades didn’t. But Honorblades could be brought through into\nShadesmar intact—so who knew what the rules would be for Nightblood.\nAt least the sword didn’t suck his Stormlight away. It was likely still\nsheathed.\nWorn out, low on Stormlight, Szeth projected control and focus, calling a\nwave from below to lift him. He soon entered the currents Pozen had sent,\nwhich again tried to smash him against the land. Szeth continued upward\nthough, until his head and shoulders broke the surface of the ocean. He used\nhis left arm to cling to the obsidian ridge, the top of which was only a few\ninches above the beads. In his right hand, beneath the beads, he clung to\nNightblood’s hilt, not revealing it.\nThe Edgedancer was already atop the ridge. She strode along it toward\nhim, grey robes rustling, her Blade out and held before her. She didn’t\nengage him in conversation; she just raised her weapon, preparing to chop\ndown through his head.\nSzeth ripped his right hand from the beads.\nAnd released an explosion of light.\nIn that hand he held not a jet-black sword, but a blazing, radiant line of\ngolden light. Glowing like the sun itself, so bright it made the Edgedancer\ngasp and stumble back, shading her eyes with her left hand.\nSzeth hauled himself onto the obsidian ridge. He took the effulgent\nweapon—it was a sword, if difficult to see through the blinding light—and\nheld it before him. Fortunately, his eyes adjusted, letting him see his enemy\nenough to fight.\n“Sword-nimi?” he whispered. “What happened to you?”\nHappened? Nightblood asked, the voice … different. Distorted, as if\nheard underwater. Nothing happened. Say, where did the hill where we were\ncamping go? Did the grass get covered in those beads?\n“We’re in Shadesmar,” Szeth said. “You don’t know?”\nWhat’s Shadesmar? Oh! Is that person in front of us evil? Are you really\ngoing to use me to fight? Yay!\nSzeth glanced to the side, to where he caught sight of his spren drifting\nin the beads, useless as he tried to swim.\n“Yes,” Szeth said. “I am proud to wield you.”\nWhat a great choice!\n“Why are you glowing though?”\nGlowing? I always glow, don’t I?\nThe truth of it clicked with Szeth. This was Shadesmar, the land of the\nmind.

Their skill, however, was\none he had taken to fairly well—which let him know how to fight one of\ntheir kind. He used that understanding now, blocking the Edgedancer’s\nattacks with a sequence of expert parries—and using small Lashings to\nmake himself lighter, to pull him out of the way with extra speed when\ndodging.\nShe spun, coasting backward a short distance and watching him with\nwhat he read as concern. Then she gritted her teeth and came in a second\ntime—and once more he easily dodged or parried each of her strikes.\nAlthough she moved like a liquid, he moved like the wind. As they again\nparted, she was puffing, Stormlight leaking from her lips as she skidded to a\nstop, illuminated starkly by Nightblood. Bright highlights and harsh\nshadows. He was winning.\nIt was not good to take pride in his skill. To kill was to subtract, after all.\nYet after what she’d said earlier, he did feel some measure of enjoyment at\nthe way she regarded him. It was easy to pretend superiority when you left\nyour opponent unable to resist in any meaningful way. Szeth turned and\npositioned himself with his sword held before him, shining and brilliant,\nthen nodded to the Edgedancer to come in again.\nAre we … fighting or sparring? Nightblood asked.\n“Fighting, sword-nimi,” Szeth said softly. “They would kill me.”\nUnfortunately, as the Edgedancer prepared, beads began to bubble up\nand pour onto the narrow peninsula of ground. Szeth glanced out into the\nocean, where Pozen had floated over—still cross-legged on a platform of\nbeads, Shardblade in his lap. Beads surged up around Szeth to interfere in\nthe fight; they began to pool around him, shoving him off balance, locking\ntogether and trying to trap his feet.\nThat is cheating, Nightblood said. That’s cheating, isn’t it, Szeth?\nSzeth grunted as he tried to lift into the air, but beads grabbed him by the\nlegs and held on. He tried to prepare the mental commands to get the beads\nto let go, but couldn’t spare that attention—as the Edgedancer attacked in a\nblinding sequence of strikes. True swordplay on this level wasn’t about\nparrying, despite his showy engagements earlier. So while he managed to\nblock some of her attacks, another one speared him straight through the left\nthigh, making him stumble.\nDo you want extra help? Nightblood asked.\n“Yes,” Szeth whispered. “Please.” He grabbed the sword in two hands,\nstaggering. He had to balance on one leg, fighting with the beads that—\nhaving formed snaking tentacles—tried to pull him down.\nDRAW ME.\nThe Edgedancer came at him, ready to swing a powerful, two-handed\nattack. Szeth growled and whipped the golden sheath from Nightblood,\nreleasing a further explosion of light—though it began to drain Szeth’s\nStormlight at a furious rate. Szeth raised his own attack, swinging with\neverything he had.\nBlade met Blade.\nA crash exploded from the swords—a blast of force that hurled back"

Szeth raised his own attack, swinging with\neverything he had.\nBlade met Blade.\nA crash exploded from the swords—a blast of force that hurled back\nbeads in a massive crater around Szeth some fifty feet wide. The hit tossed\nthe Edgedancer like a leaf, her Blade flung from her fingers to shimmer and\nfall into the beads while she crumpled and rolled backward along the ridge.\nNo Stormlight wafted from her body. She fell still, as if dead.\nSzeth gasped, barely stabilizing himself on one leg—and resheathed the\nsword. Beads rained down distantly into the ocean.\nHmm, Nightblood said. That didn’t do what I thought it would.\n“What … did you think it would do?” Szeth said.\nI’ve been chatting with the Honorblades you recovered, and thought\nmaybe I’d give you some other Radiant abilities.\n“You can … actually do that?” Szeth asked.\nApparently not. I really thought I’d figured it out. Sorry, Szeth.\n“This will do,” Szeth said, drawing Stormlight and letting it surge into\nhis wounded leg. He stepped forward a moment later, healed, walking\ntoward the Edgedancer as she climbed to her feet, woozy. She saw him,\nthen resummoned her Blade. She’d stopped glowing, however.\nNo Stormlight. No powers.\n“Stand down,” Szeth said to her.\nShe growled and launched at him with her Blade, so Szeth swung and\nexpertly feinted, then unsheathed his blade again and struck—Nightblood\ndidn’t simply cut, but made the Edgedancer burst into motes of light. Like\ntiny meteorites scattering away from him in a million sparks that vaporized\nand vanished.\nAs Szeth resheathed—Nightblood having consumed the last of his\nStormlight—her Honorblade clanged to the ridge, then slipped and fell into\nthe beads. Szeth turned toward Pozen—who remained sitting patiently out\nin the sea. The elderly man held his hand to the side, and the beads there\nsplit, delivering to him the Edgedancer Honorblade, which he placed into\nhis lap alongside his own weapon.\n“You are defeated, Pozen,” Szeth shouted across the sixty or so feet\nseparating them. “Reject the touch of the Unmade! Help me cleanse the\nland, rather than bolstering the darkness!”\n“You have no idea of what you speak,” Pozen called back. “You have\nalways had trouble seeing the right of things, Szeth-son-Neturo.”\n“True,” Szeth said softly. “But I think I might at last be seeing clearly.”\nHe stepped to the edge of the beads, pondering how to cross them to Pozen,\nand they hardened in front of him.\nAh, there, Nightblood said. That helps, doesn’t it?\n“Thank you, sword-nimi,” Szeth said, striding across the surface of the\nocean. As he took each step, the beads locked together underfoot.\nThe beads like Honorblades. Oh! They like regular Shardblades too. And\nthe spren who make them. Something about the bond …\n“You think you have won,” Pozen called as Szeth approached. “But I see\nyou are out of Stormlight, Szeth-son-Neturo.”"

Something about the bond …\n“You think you have won,” Pozen called as Szeth approached. “But I see\nyou are out of Stormlight, Szeth-son-Neturo.”\n“Pozen,” Szeth said, “you cannot defeat me in a duel. We both know\nthat. Let us talk. Can you spare me no courtesy? After all those months we\nspent together?”\n“Months spent preparing you,” Pozen said, “for a duty you rejected.”\nStill, the elderly man studied him, and there was … something between\nthem. Not affection. Neither had particularly liked the other.\nBut Pozen was the Honorbearer with whom Szeth had spent the most\ntime. The first who had recruited him. So the elderly man held up a hand,\nhalting Szeth’s advance.\n“I will give you a chance, Szeth,” Pozen said softly. “If you can\nremember what I taught you, and apply it. You never did learn to Elsegate.\nWell, let us see if you can figure it out when the stakes are so high.”\nSzeth cursed and started running.\nPozen stood up, then fell forward onto his Honorblade. Szeth screamed\nas he arrived, stabilizing the ground of that pillar so it didn’t fall apart at\nPozen’s death. He dropped to his knees, grabbing the body in one hand,\nNightblood in the other.\nThe corpse evaporated into dark mist, the same way the Stoneward had.\nSzeth looked up, kneeling before the two Honorblades, and scanned the\narea around him. No sign of any ships. He had no supplies, and was in the\nmiddle of an ocean. Even if he could walk down the river peninsula and\nfind land, it would take him weeks to reach a settlement. He’d be dead long\nbefore that. Rain did not fall in Shadesmar.\nSzeth? Nightblood asked. What is wrong? Why do you have that\nexpression?\n“We are trapped, sword-nimi,” Szeth whispered. “I cannot get us out of\nthis place.”\nThis place? Nightblood said. Oh, the sword is explaining. Strange. But\nSzeth, you’re amazing. You can get us out.\nCould he?\nSzeth searched Pozen’s robes, and found a pouch of gemstones. He drew\nin that Light, then took Pozen’s Honorblade in one hand, admiring it. A\ndecade ago, he’d used it to come to Shadesmar during his pilgrimage. He’d\nhad to be rescued by Pozen—borrowing the Willshaper Honorblade—to get\nback out. Holding it this time though, he felt something.\nFear?\nThe Honorblade didn’t speak, at least not to people. But it was afraid. It\nknew something was deeply wrong. Whatever was happening in Shinovar,\nthis Blade wasn’t part of the problem—and it was as confused as Szeth. It\nwanted to be in the hands of its true owner, the Herald.\nSzeth closed his eyes and whispered a prayer. To the spren of this Blade,\nto the spren of his land. He concentrated, and didn’t rely on the training that\nhad never worked. Instead he focused on his quest.\nIf he did not return, his people were doomed. And he would never find\nout how, or why, his father had died."

And he would never find\nout how, or why, his father had died.\nTo this urgent need, the Honorblade seemed to listen, and made up for\nhis inadequacy.\nLet’s go! Nightblood said. I’ll bet Syl is worried about me!\nSzeth stabbed into the air. His hand grew cold as the Honorblade drew\nStormlight from him in a rush, and the weapon’s tip sliced through reality\nitself, cutting a slit like in the stomach of an enemy, maybe four feet across.\nIt bowed outward, a hole just big enough for him to pass through.\nHis exhaustion struck him right as the beads under his feet began to\nundulate and fall apart. With a cry, he clutched Nightblood and the two\nHonorblades, then sprang through the opening and tumbled out onto a dark\nlandscape.\nSpringy grass above loam, smelling of freshness and life. He drew a\ndeep breath and flopped onto his back, enervated by the sudden loss of\nStormlight. The golden version of Nightblood had vanished from his hand,\nbut Szeth heard the black sword humming and talking from where he’d left\nit by the tree. He still had the two Honorblades, and he’d managed to avoid\nimpaling himself as he fell.\nSo he took a moment, lying there and looking up at the sky. Until a\nshadow in the night approached and loomed over him.\n“Szeth?” Kaladin asked. “Here you are. Why did you wander off? Stop\nlounging—shouldn’t we be planning the confrontation with the next\nHonorbearer?”\nSzeth laughed at that. Kaladin—raising a sphere for light—spotted the\ntwo Honorblades and gasped.\n“You did well, Szeth,” Szeth’s highspren said in his ear. “A challenge\nmet and overcome.”\n“You sound so confident,” Szeth whispered.\n“I am,” the spren said, invisible.\n“Then would you prefer I forget the image of you floundering in the\nbeads? That of your providing, when asked to help, a spoon? Shall I forget\nhow useless you were?”\n“I … That was … intentional. To ensure you did not rely upon me.”\n“Yes, of course, spren-nimi,” he said. “If we continue, we will find the\nLightweaver monastery next, will we not?”\n“Yes. That would make sense.”\n“It is good, then, that I share with you something I learned from my\nteacher in Lightweaving many years ago.”\n“Um … all right,” the spren said. “What is that?”\nSzeth cracked an eye at Kaladin, who was demanding answers. Instead,\nSzeth whispered softly to the spren.\n“When you’re living an illusion, spren-nimi, be very careful not to do\nanything to spoil it. Because once you do, it is exceedingly difficult to\nrecapture your audience.”\nIndeed, some insist that among Radiants, some Skybreakers did\nstep forth into the Recreance, and their actions are covered; to\nthis end, I have engaged the commentary of Didal; it strikes as\nmendacious that any Skybreaker would turn upon their oaths, and\nI find their malignment to be uniformly abhorrent.

The\nSkybreakers, who have always quietly cared for those the law\nforgets, do still exist, as previously accounted; they merely exist in\nmultiple forms.\n—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 3\nShallan sat and watched a school of skyeels dancing in the sky. Playfully\nnipping at one another, swirling and streaming. Though she was too distant\nto see the subtle details of the three-color split, it was manifest all around\nher. These worlds, created by Renarin’s and Rlain’s spren, made her feel as\nif she were living in a woodblock print.\nThis time they were at one of the warcamps. Nearby, Rlain and Renarin\nsat with their feet hanging over the side of a chasm. She’d never known\nRenarin to be overtly cheerful, but he laughed at something Rlain said. The\nspren didn’t think Dalinar and Navani had found their way to another vision\nyet, which gave her time to think about what had happened in the last one.\nHer clash with Mraize had nearly revealed her to the gods.\nPerhaps they could plan better for the next time. And perhaps she could\nfigure out what was happening to her mind.\n“How did Formless come back, Pattern?” Shallan asked. She sat at the\nedge of the camp, near the crumbled wall. Pattern sat to her right on a\nbroken section of the wall, hands crossed primly in his lap.\n“I do not know,” he said. Testament sat a little farther up on the same\nbroken wall, regarding the skyeels. “I do not think humans make sense\nwhen they are sane! Let alone when they are not. Ha ha.”\nShe tipped her head back and felt the breeze, making pictures in her\nmind from the clouds. This idyllic version of the Shattered Plains had been\nconstructed from Rlain’s memory. It depicted a time before humans arrived,\nthough no one else—singer or human—appeared in the vision. Their touch\nwas represented in the cloths hanging from windows, the crops growing in\nthe distance, the spears and bows leaning against one wall. It was like\nvisiting a home when the occupants had stepped out, soon to return.\n“I banished Formless,” Shallan said. “I grew past that. I don’t need her.”\n“Agreed,” Pattern said.\n“Is this what it will be like?” Shallan asked. “For the rest of my life?\nKnowing that my mind could—at any moment—backslide? Knowing that\nis always lurking around the corner?”\n“I’m sorry, Shallan.”\nShe squeezed her eyes shut. “It was almost better, Pattern, when I didn’t\nknow. Then, it wasn’t my fault when I failed. Or at least I could pretend it\nwasn’t.”\n“Shallan,” Pattern whispered, “what did Wit say?”\n“I know …”\n“Repeat it.”\n“I don’t deserve it,” she whispered. “What was done to me is not my\nfault.

It’s awful, and it’s unfair, but I do.” She took a deep breath. “I’m\nnot going to let Formless manifest as a full aspect of my personality. Veil\nand Radiant are coping mechanisms, and they helped me survive. But\nFormless … she’s me. Not an alternate persona, but a representation of me\ngiving up. That is me if I just … become what Mraize wants.”\n“You won’t give in to that, Shallan.”\n“No. I won’t.”\n“Then there is nothing to fear. Perhaps she only manifests here as a\nreminder. Maybe?”\nShe looked to him, to find his head pattern spinning and transforming,\nmesmerizing, faster than normal. He was worried for her.\n“Thank you,” she said.\n“Oh!” he said, perking up. “I said the right things?”\n“It’s more that you were here,” she said, smiling.\n“I am very good at this,” Pattern said. “Mmmm. That might be a lie, but\nI don’t care!”\nShallan gazed up at the sky, past the eels, at the clouds. “I wonder how\nAdolin is doing. Is he all right, do you think? He had to go to war without\nme.”\n“He is very strong,” Pattern said. “The best swordsman I know! Or really\nthat anyone knows!”\nThat was true, but being the best didn’t always protect you. Sometimes it\nmade you a target. She continued staring at the clouds, imagining them as\n…\nThe face of Ba-Ado-Mishram. Glaring down at her malevolently.\nShallan’s breath caught, and she glanced at Testament, who had been\nstaring in that direction all this time. She wasn’t watching the skyeels, but\nthat face in the clouds.\nRenarin suddenly cried out and stumbled to his feet. So, he’d noticed as\nwell. Together the two men hurried back to her, their spren joining them\nfrom the shadows nearby, where they liked to linger—though they would as\noften inhabit their hosts’ bodies somehow.\n“Face,” Renarin said, pointing to where he’d been sitting. “In the\npatterns of the stone on the ground.”\n“Like that one?” Shallan asked, nodding toward the sky.\nHe followed her gesture, then cursed and crouched down.\n“Perhaps we should go indoors,” Rlain said.\n“If you saw her in the stones,” Shallan said, “then she’s tainting this\nentire vision. We’ll find her face in there too.”\n“Yes,” Rlain said. “But which would you rather have watching you? A\nface in a stonework wall or that?”\n“Oh!” Pattern exclaimed. “I like the giant one. It is more intimidating.”\n“You like that?” Rlain’s words dripped with a frantic rhythm.\n“I have decided I like style,” Pattern said. “It is a Lightweaver thing,\nwhich we are very good at recognizing.” He pointed. “That is style.”"

And it seemed to say a lot if one of them\nfound Pattern strange.\nSome of the way he acts, Radiant said, her voice amused, he learned\nfrom you. I should think you would be proud.\nThey retreated into a hollow stone building overgrown with crem\ndrippings like candle wax. These sorts of things had been cleaned up when\nthe humans had taken the region, which in retrospect Shallan found a\nshame. The organic, melted feel was so much more engaging and different\nfrom …\nWas that Veil snickering at her? Just for liking an odd building?\nHonestly.\nThis was where Rlain had grown up. Unlike Renarin’s room, this had no\nfine furniture—though he did have a basket for possessions and a nice\nmattress for the bed.\n“What’s this?” Renarin said, gesturing to a smaller bed. “Sibling?”\n“Hound,” Rlain said. “I raised axehounds when younger. Had to let them\ngo when we fled to Narak.”\n“Axehounds,” Renarin said. “I didn’t know that about you.”\n“I got along with them better than I did with people.” Rlain shrugged and\nsettled onto the bed, now far too small for him. “Funny. I used to think this\nbed was so roomy when I was in workform. But today this body feels like\nthe right one, so it’s hard to reconcile my perfect bed with the fact that I no\nlonger fit it.”\n“You really grew up here?” Shallan asked, peering around for signs of\nMishram’s face. She found it on three separate stones, as if part of the\nnatural pattern of the rock.\n“My whole childhood,” he said. “When my parents died in the flood, it\nwas just me in here. The strange one, on his own with his hounds …”\n“Was that hard?” Renarin asked. “As a child?”\n“I was nearly seven when it happened,” Rlain said. “So, not that bad.”\nIt took Renarin a moment to process that—Shallan noticed him thinking\nit through. Singers matured much faster than humans did, reaching\nadulthood by age ten.\n“Still,” Renarin said.\n“You get used to being alone,” Rlain said. “Sometimes a little too used to\nit, you know?”\n“I do,” Renarin said. “Trust me.” He looked like he wanted to say\nsomething more, and Shallan had the distinct feeling she was intruding.\nRenarin backed off, turning away and finding something to fiddle with—in\nthis case a few pebbles from his pocket that he could roll and count between\nhis fingers.\n“So,” Shallan said, cutting in, “should we talk about the way Mishram is\nwatching us?”\n“Mmm …” Pattern said. “You think of her, and it draws her attention.\nThe prison is leaking.”\n“She shouldn’t be able to see in here,” Glys said. “This should be safe,\neven from gods …”\n“However, if she’s watching us,” Rlain said, feet up on the head of his\nbed, “we must be on the right track.”"

That’s our mission.”\n“I tried,” Shallan said. “And I almost revealed your spren to the gods. Do\nthey have any advice for avoiding that?”\n“No armor,” Renarin said, glancing toward Pattern and Testament, who\nhad settled down over beside the firepit. His and Rlain’s mistspren loomed\nin the doorway, and didn’t fully enter for some reason. “When you\nsummoned that you almost outed us.”\n“It doesn’t work here anyway,” Shallan said.\n“I wish we could understand,” Rlain said, “what’s being said in the\nvisions. We’re focused on stopping these assassins, but the visions could\ntell us so much. Like how Honor died.”\n“Do we really want to know?” Renarin asked.\n“Why wouldn’t we?” Rlain said.\n“Because the truth can be painful,” Renarin said.\n“So you’d rather not know it?” Rlain asked, his rhythm changing.\n“Sometimes,” Shallan said. “Sometimes that’s tempting.”\nRenarin looked to her and nodded. “Regardless,” he said, “I think we\nshould try again at stopping the Ghostbloods, in another vision. But\nShallan, Rlain and I aren’t experts at acting. I worry we might hold you\nback.”\n“Possibly,” Shallan said. “But you’re experts—or the closest we have—\non this realm. I think I’m way better off with you two along. Besides,\nthere’s two of them and three of us. Our best shot at taking them is\ntogether.”\n“Agreed,” Rlain said. “Can we arm ourselves?”\n“I have this,” Shallan said, bringing out the dagger that warped the air.\n“So we have something.”\n“Rlain and I will just have to find weapons in whichever vision we\nenter,” Renarin said, then took a deep breath. “We’re agreed? We try again\nto trap or kill the assassins?”\nShallan and Rlain nodded. Now it was up to the spren to warn them\nwhen another vision was ready.\nHours after the latest assault, Adolin walked unarmored through the square\noutside the Oathgate dome, which had fallen quiet once more. Storms, he\nwas exhausted. They’d fended off the attack, but it had lasted much longer\nthan the others.\nThey’re trying to break us, he thought. Don’t let them. Still, it was\ndifficult to ignore the swarms of exhaustionspren. Only two days in, and he\nwas starting to worry. About the mystery strike force harrying the\nreinforcements. About losing too many soldiers. About another city doomed\nto be abandoned.\nIt was pretty out here on the plaza. Tens of twinkling cookfires dotted the\nsquare, each with its own dancing flamespren, made in little portable\nhearths provided by the Azish.

The\nShattered Plains, then Urithiru, both chillier than his homeland. How long\nhad it been since he’d lived in Alethkar? He’d barely been a man when he’d\nridden off to the war on the Shattered Plains. He’d gone back to Kholinar\nonce, of course. And left it burning.\nStorms, he’d been trying to relax, but it felt like he was carrying an\nincredible weight all of a sudden. Memories. He’d failed many times in his\nlife, but Kholinar was different. Everyone made mistakes. But not everyone\nleft their city to the enemy. The city where he, Adolin, should have been\nking. If he hadn’t abandoned it … both the throne and the land.\nAt the same time, not everyone murdered another highprince in a\nsecluded hallway. Though Adolin stood by that action and would do it\nagain, that was part of the weight. A better man might have found another\nway. And a better man certainly wouldn’t have covered it up as he had.\nHe halted, missing Shallan. He felt the cool wind blow across him and\nwished he knew its name, for everything had a name. These days he wasn’t\ncompletely sure of his own.\n“Highprince Adolin?” a voice asked from nearby.\nHe turned, surprised to see Noura, the head vizier, approaching, her\npatterned clothing blending in with the night’s shadows. He idly wondered\nif that gave their soldiers an advantage in the dark.\n“Yes?” he asked.\n“I have come to request a favor,” the older woman said, walking closer\nto him, visible by green moonlight as neither of them carried a lamp or\nsphere. “Will you please cease your corruption of the Prime? You are\nconfusing him and frustrating our attempts to guide him in the correct way.”\nAdolin turned back toward the wind, and fell naturally into a parade rest.\nA soldier’s ways for a soldier’s son. “Do the moons look bigger here in\nAzimir?”\n“I really wouldn’t know, Brightlord.”\nHe grunted, then shifted—maintaining his stance—to face the emperor’s\ngrand pavilion. “What do you think Yanagawn needs, Noura?”\n“Careful guidance,” she replied, “to provide stability to the empire, so\nthe empire may provide stability to him.”\n“Sounds like smart words quoted from somewhere.”\n“My own essay,” she admitted, “when I applied for this position. Adolin,\nso long as the emperor is on his throne, Azimir stands. It is one of our\nstrongest mottos. He is to sit and rule, not pretend to be a soldier.”\n“Well,” Adolin said, still studying that pavilion—lit from the inside by\ncalm spheres, making the whole thing glow like a lantern. “Sitting there\nmight be what the emperor needs, and what the empire needs. But that’s not\nwhat I asked, now is it?”\n“Yanagawn needs whatever the empire needs.”\n“No,” Adolin said, pivoting to meet her eyes in the darkness. “Noura,\nthat young man needs a friend.”\n“He has friends.”"

That loneliness can destroy a\nperson, and I’m grateful for those I was able to trust. Yanagawn needs\nsomeone he can talk to who isn’t in his chain of command, or whatever you\ncall it for someone like him. He needs someone who isn’t related to him, in\ncharge of him, or serving him.”\n“He’s stronger than you think.”\n“Storm it, Noura, it’s not about strength.” He waved toward the pavilion,\nand kept his voice down. “Of course he’s strong. But people break, and\nsometimes the strong ones break harder than the weak ones—because\nthey’re the ones you pile everything on top of. You ever seen what happens\nwhen you put too much weight on a horse? I don’t care if it’s an old nag or\na Ryshadium warhorse—you can break its spine, Noura.”\n“You think I don’t care?” she hissed, stepping right up to him. Though\nshe was quite a bit shorter, there was a fire to her he could practically feel.\n“I put that boy on the throne, knowing full well what I was asking of him. I\nlive each day doing whatever I can to uphold him. He is my emperor.”\n“Oh?” Adolin said. “Lift told me how he got elevated—that he was\npicked as a convenient dupe. Someone for Szeth to murder because no one\nelse would take the spot. He’s disposable to you, so don’t moralize to me.”\nHe expected her to break his gaze, to turn away in shame, but she set her\njaw. “Yes,” she admitted. “We did that to a boy, for the good of the empire,\nbut then that boy became my Prime. I’d die for him. Do you believe that,\nKholin? The moment we elevated him, he became my responsibility, my\nduty, my life.”\n“I …” Storms. He’d expected some fiddling bureaucrat. He’d\nunderestimated her, hadn’t he? “I believe you.”\n“Then believe that I know what he needs.”\n“All right,” Adolin said. “I’ll back off if you can look me straight in the\neyes and tell me—in all honesty—that the boy isn’t still there inside that\nemperor. You tell me he doesn’t need a friend.”\nSilence. She held his eyes, and her jaw worked. But she couldn’t force it\nout. “It isn’t proper,” she finally said, “for our emperor to walk into battle.\nIt violates tradition.”\n“I’ve been around enough scribes to know you make tradition. My father\nand I disagree on a number of things, but there’s one point on which we do\nagree: any man, anywhere, should have the right to pick up the spear or\nsword and fight for what he believes in.

If you deny Yanagawn that, you\ndeny him manhood itself.”\nAt this, Noura rolled her eyes. “And you were doing so well … then,\nreliable old Alethi chauvinism.”\nAdolin refused to be baited. He narrowed his eyes. “There’s more here,\nisn’t there? About me? What is it you don’t like about me, Noura?”\nShe weighed her response, folding her arms. “You walked away from the\nthrone, Kholin. You are one of the only people in the world who could\nactually have been on the Prime’s level, and you walked away from it. That\ndegree of irresponsibility is … concerning.”\nHe started, and dropped his parade stance at last. “You … think I’m\ngoing to convince him to do the same?”\n“Ideas are more contagious than any disease,” she said. “And Kholin,\nYanagawn is a good emperor. He has the heart to be an excellent one. If\nyou’d seen the progress he’s made … If you knew the previous emperors,\nall excellent candidates on paper, who became shells … Do you realize how\nlong it’s been since we had a Prime who truly understood the needs of the\ncommon people? We can’t lose him.”\n“Then listen,” Adolin whispered. “If you keep him isolated, without\nfriends, that will break him, Noura.”\nShe held his eyes, hers reflecting green moonlight.\n“Why did you turn away from your throne?” she finally asked. “What\nhappened?”\n“It has something to do with what he and I talked about today,” Adolin\nsaid. “Something I never put a finger on. Oaths versus promises.\nExpectation versus execution. Give Yanagawn a little freedom, Noura, and\nhe’ll soar. Hold him down, and he’ll start looking for exits lower to the\nground.” He grinned at her. “And if you want someone near him who\ndoesn’t want anything, then, well … consider that there’s a single person in\nthis storming world who had it all in the palm of his hand, and walked\naway.” Adolin tapped his chest. “Know for certain that one man doesn’t\nwant your emperor’s throne, or his money, or his power. Consider that, then\nask yourself why I care.”\n“Because you’ve been there,” she whispered.\n“Storming right I have,” Adolin said. “Still am.” He gave her a bow of\nthe head, then turned and walked off. She didn’t call for him to return or\ndemand he stay away. So he figured that was a battle won, or at least fought\nto a stalemate.\nTHE END OF\nDay Four\nMoash was done.\nI killed Teft …\nOdium no longer protected Moash from his own emotions. His eyes had\nbeen burned away, leaving him with one final image—as if struck upon his\nmind like the branding of a glyph: the queen of Urithiru with a halo of light\naround her, and he swore …\n… he swore …\n… that he’d seen Teft’s spirit, Radiant and accusatory, rising behind her\nas part of that glow."

Humming singers and constant stonework.\nKholinar, he thought, after a long flight. He’d been recovered from the\nsnows of Urithiru, then eventually deposited here. His bed was plush, but\nhis innards were raw as he groaned and turned on his side, clawing at his\nface.\nI killed Teft.\nThe god of all emotions had promised to protect Moash from these\nfeelings, this awful guilt, this sense of worthlessness. That was why he’d\nbelieved. Why he’d followed.\n“Take my pain,” he croaked. “Why won’t you take my pain?”\n“I don’t do that any longer, Vyre,” a quiet voice said from next to his\nbed.\nMoash turned toward the sound, trying to look, despite no longer having\neyes. He did that every time. Looking. Not seeing.\nThat voice. It was different, but …\n“It is not right for me to take emotions,” the voice said. “My predecessor\nwas a glutton, and would feed upon those of his followers. Not I. Your\npassion is what makes you live, Vyre. What god of passion am I if I do not\ncelebrate emotion in my followers?”\n“You celebrate this?” Moash asked, clawing at his face again. “I feel like\nI’m being ripped apart. Each day I’m destroyed anew, condemned as a\nmonster …”\n“That is the price we pay,” the voice said, “for doing what is right. If it\ndid not have a cost, would it be a sacrifice to do what was right? Would not\nall people just do it naturally?”\n“Right?” Moash asked. “Killing a friend?”\n“If a man must die for his choices,” the voice said, “is it not better that\nhe be killed by a friend, who will mourn him?” Sounds of clothing\nrumpling. A chair scooting. As if the speaker was leaning forward in his\nseat. “You’re not a monster. A monster would murder with glee and love it.\nTo kill with agony, like a surgeon who must bring pain … those are the\nactions of a hero, Vyre.”\nA … hero?\n“Who are you?” Moash asked.\n“Your new god,” the voice said. “Y .”\nOU KNOW ME\nThat voice, that use of tone … it was Odium. But a new Odium.\nDifferent, yet the same.\n“Take my pain …” Moash whispered.\n“No, Vyre, I will not. If you cannot bear the price, then you are not\nworthy of your title or Blade. However, there is something I can give you.\nSee. Not with your eyes—I cannot restore them, as they were taken by an\nact of my adversary—but I can still engage your mind.”\nAnd Moash saw. Or … imagined. Glorious forces marching to war,\nacross a hundred worlds, bringing peace and order to so many. He saw\npeace, serenity, a thousand wrongs righted. Kings cast down, and the\nfamilies of working people—like those who ran the caravans—given, at\nlong last, true retribution for the crimes committed against them."

Forged beneath the banner of an eternal, immortal army\nled by a man in black Shardplate, eyes glowing red.\n“The Blackthorn serves you?”\n“He may,” Odium said. “Equal odds, depending on his choices in a few\ndays. But if not him, another. Vyre, isn’t this what you want? Isn’t this why\nyou turned against your friends in the first place? Why do you fight?”\n“Because nothing matters …”\n“Why did you fight?”\n“Because the king of Alethkar was a rat, who got good men killed. And\nnobody would ever bring him to justice for his crimes.”\n“What you see,” Odium said, “is every wrong being righted. Every\nwrong. If you follow me, you can decide how that happens, and who is\nrewarded. Is that not better than fighting for nothing? Better than feeling\nnothing? When you contemplate your pain, contemplate the peace and unity\nthat pain will earn for so many. Let it become a badge to you, Vyre.”\nA badge. A way to recover the man he’d once been, who had stood\nagainst even Kaladin to bring justice to the men who wore crowns and\nexploited the weak. That was who Moash had been.\n“How?” Moash asked.\n“You’re willing to try again?” Odium asked. “Although it may require\nopposing your friends? For they might name you traitor, but they never do\nstop being your friends, do they?”\n“No. They don’t.”\n“I understand better than any,” Odium said. “It’s why I care about you,\nVyre. Yes, I do understand …”\nThe chair moved again, then Odium’s voice, more distant: “He’s yours.\nLet’s see if this works.”\nHands strapped him down in the darkness. They shoved a cloth into his\nmouth to muffle screams, and then, what happened next …\nThey took mallets and pounded spikes of light through his skull. He\nscreamed. But this time the screams were in defiance of the pain, both\noutside and in. They were in rejection of the guilt, for he had been working\nfor a greater world. How dare they fight against him?\nHow dare Kaladin claim to protect, when he defended the highborn who\nmurdered? He was a pawn. How dare he not admit it? How dare he serve\nthem?\nWhen it was finished, the agony throbbing through Moash, he lay in a\nsweat, ragged and used, like an old pair of shoes worn on far too long a\nwalk. They’d done something with his empty eye sockets, something that\nshould have killed him. But as he lay there, wondering at the point of it, he\n…\nHe saw.\nNot as he had. Outlines of light, the people specifically, and …\ngemstones, infused. Living things. No color, but … spren.\nHe could see spren. All around.\n“That should work,” a new voice said, feminine. “Look at his response.\nIt’s functioning.

He looked around the room,\nand found Odium as a blazing source of light, his figure washed out by the\npower. Like a sun standing not ten feet away. And with him another,\nglowing with a different kind of light. A different … not color … rhythm of\nlight?\n“I will do what must be done,” Vyre said. “Because someone must.”\n“That is right, Vyre,” Odium said.\nAfter spending some time allowing intellect to rule, Taravangian changed.\nHe let intellect be ruled by emotions for now, and braced himself for what\ncame next: A flood of passions and feelings. A dam broken down. They\nwashed through him, each stronger than the last.\nWorry, confidence, passion, fear, rage. Rage.\nHe instantly traveled back to Kharbranth, the home that he cared for so\ndearly. He blanketed the city so he could feel the emotions of each and\nevery person there.\nHe loved them. Oh, how he loved this city, with its art, and its library,\nand its many hospitals that took any patient without cost. He even loved the\nsecret portions of those hospitals, where people had died—feeling so many\nthings—at the hands of his surgeons, killed to gather their Death Rattles.\nSacrifices made in a terrible, but important quest—for that had once been\nhis sole way to gain insight into the future.\nHis policies ensured the greatest good. In Kharbranth he found\njustification, for here was a city that—in war—knew peace. Insignificant\ncrime rates created by giving police the ability to exile offenders, leaving in\nKharbranth only the serene and wonderful.\nWas that enough? He began to weep, for he knew it would not be\nenough. He instantly transferred to his daughter’s room, where he sensed\nshe was playing with his grandchildren. He watched them laugh while he\ntrembled, suddenly afraid. Should he not feel love, seeing them again?\nNo. He was terrified. They were exposed.\nExpelling criminals was not enough. He needed to punish them.\nAnnihilate them, so they could not hurt his family or his people. And what\nof other kingdoms? They could come here, invade, destroy. His family\nwould never be safe unless everything everywhere was under his control.\nOnly then would he never have to fear.\nHe did not appear to his family. He gave them each a hug, but silently,\ninvisibly. They must not know what he was and what he had to do.\nEmotion insisted on war.\nIn this, remarkably, both intellect and feeling agreed.\nCultivation was wrong. War, leading to his control of everything, was the\nonly way.\nDearest Cephandrius,\nYour rebuttal is eloquent, as always, but did you think I would be\nmoved?\nVenli sat in the cave alone.

She’d carved it by her own hand, using her\nabilities to shape the stone.\nOutside, an enormous shadow passed by, accompanied by the distinctive\nscrapes and thumps of a chasmfiend. People walked with the beast, their\nrhythms optimistic. For the first time in so very long, things seemed to be\nimproving for her kind.\nUnless Venli had led ultimate destruction their way.\nShe closed her eyes, placed her hands on the stones, and sang to them.\nWelcome, child of ancients, the stones replied. Welcome, stonesinger.\nWelcome, Radiant.\n“I need guidance,” Venli whispered. “Please.”\nAbout what? the stones asked.\n“My people … by taking me in, by sheltering renegade Fused like\nLeshwi … will draw Odium’s ire. I have felt his anger. I worry that I’ve led\ndestruction to the listeners. Again.”\nWe do not know the future, the stones said. We sing of the past. Of days\nlong ago when we sang together, and you shaped us. When your kind knew\nthe stone.\nLike the rock at Urithiru, these stones were eager to speak with her—and\ntheir rhythms were those of Joy and Peace. They named themselves Ko, the\nstones of the hills, but sometimes spoke as if all stone—indeed, all Roshar\n—were one.\nThey eagerly showed her the past, and with her powers that meant\nshapes appeared from the stone floor. Tiny sculptures only inches tall,\nrepresenting her people crossing to this land. Periodically looking up, as if\nnoticing something. Or … listening?\nThe rock had no answers. It didn’t care about the “new” gods; it just\nwanted to sing, which would have been delightful, if she weren’t\nincreasingly anxious over what she’d done. Taking the oaths of a Knight\nRadiant, at long last. Her words being accepted by … well, she supposed it\nmust have been Cultivation.\nVenli had brought the Reachers, the lightspren, to her kind. Starting with\nJaxlim, Venli’s mother, a full two dozen listeners had bonded spren. A\nbrilliant outpouring of power, far faster than any of the other orders had\nbeen refounded. The lightspren had been so eager.\nAnd yet … this sort of thing drew attention. Lately she’d been hearing\ndistant thunder, that of the Everstorm approaching, though no one else\nseemed to be able to hear it. That sound terrified her; she knew him all too\nwell. With her hands on the ground of her small chamber, her flesh shivered\n—and her stomach twisted, her carapace feeling cold—as she remembered\ndays serving him. Singing his songs, his rhythms. Watching as he destroyed\nthe listeners—so he’d thought—in order to create false martyrs to pin on\nthe humans.\nA remnant had survived somehow, despite it all. And she’d come to\nthem. She had to help.\nPlease, she said to the stones. Give me a way.\nThey merely continued to sing with her, joyous. We’re happy you’re\nhere. We brought you to this place, where the songs were once the loudest,\nand now you sing with us again.\nThe stones didn’t think about tomorrow. Let the wind worry about that."

Although\nshe hadn’t gotten her answers, when speaking with the stones she couldn’t\nhelp but find a sense of place. She hadn’t realized, until a quiet day at\nUrithiru, how much the songs meant to her. How much her heritage meant\nto her. She’d squandered these wonders all her life, her own eyes on the\nfuture—and only the future.\nUnfortunately, having been Odium’s mouthpiece, she knew him all too\nwell. He would come for them once he’d dealt with the humans. She rose,\nand left her cave to gaze out at her people. Seventeen hundred listeners,\nincluding many children. The elderly, the infirm, the young, and a stalwart\ngroup of soldiers, Eshonai’s closest friends—who had refused the forms of\npower Venli had brought.\nThese were the true soul of the listeners. They had looked power in the\neyes and had rejected it.\nBeing a listener means … the stones said to her … to listen to the stones\n… and your ancestors …\nInside her, Timbre attuned the Rhythm of Remembrance. Here in these\ncompletely unsheltered lands—the wide flatland southeast of the Shattered\nPlains—Venli’s people made homes from crem and chunks of greatshell\ncarapace. This place had once been considered too dangerous to visit, as it\nwas the home of chasmfiends.\nNow those chasmfiends moved among her people. Or … well, mostly\nthey slept among her people. Giant lumps of monstrous chitin, who were\ncontent to lounge around with people literally climbing all over them. They\nliked to be brushed or scratched like giant axehound pups. And her people\nhad no lack of food, as evidenced by a chasmfiend returning from the hunt\ndragging a twenty-foot-tall dead zumble—a herbivore with a bulbous black\ncarapace. The chasmfiend let the listeners slice off some chunks for cooking\nas it settled down to eat.\nA gentle humming drew her attention. She glanced over as her mother,\nJaxlim, stepped up—a listener with a round face, long hairstrands in a braid,\nand a complex skin pattern of very thin lines. Instantly Venli was a little girl\nagain. Listening to the songs and diligently memorizing them at her\nmother’s feet. Usually those memories were accompanied by a frustration\nwith her sister—Eshonai had never done what she should, yet had always\nbeen Mother’s favorite.\nToday … Venli maintained Joy, and shifted to the Rhythm of the Lost for\nher sister. In the end, Eshonai had done more for their people than Venli\never had. Timbre had chosen both of them. It was not a rivalry.\nOddly, Jaxlim hummed to Anxiety. Venli returned Confusion.\n“I feel that I am to blame,” Jaxlim explained. “If I had not taught you\nsongs that made you thirst for forms of power, then maybe—”\n“Mother,” Venli said. “No. I’ve spent too many months trying to avoid"

        "text": "songs that made you thirst for forms of power, then maybe—”\n“Mother,” Venli said. “No. I’ve spent too many months trying to avoid\ntaking responsibility. I won’t have anyone give me more excuses, not even\nyou. I did what I did, and it was not your fault. The terrible choices were\nmine.”\nInside, Timbre responded with the Rhythm of Resolve.\n“Still,” Jaxlim said, looking across the people with their carapace huts\nclustered in groups of four between resting chasmfiends. “To finally come\nto myself, and to find us broken … It was my duty to guide with song and\nstory.”\nVenli stepped up next to her mother, who had always been so strong …\nuntil she wasn’t. That, Venli realized, was the way of life. No carapace was\nso thick it couldn’t crack.\nShe took her mother’s hand and hummed to Resolve. “We weathered it,”\nVenli said. “Cracked, yes, but our people survived. Now we need to find a\nway to continue without being destroyed by Odium.”\n“I don’t know if I can solve that problem entirely,” Jaxlim said, “but I’ve\nbeen thinking over the old songs, and I believe I might have something that\nwill help.”\nVenli hummed to Hope.\n“Come,” Jaxlim said. “Let us speak to your friends—the ancient ones\nyou call Fused.”\nDalinar moved through shifting realities. He told himself that he needed to\nstomach it—that he needed to see what had been.\nHe opened his eyes.\nFor the briefest moment, he stood on a burned hillside at night, in a land\nwith a strange pale moon. A broken city smoldered before him, one with\nhigh walls that had been shattered, and within it a strange people. He raised\nwhat he knew was a weapon, though it was no sword or polearm, and\nunleashed lines of light while his armies surged around him.\nHe wore black Shardplate.\nStorms. He squeezed his eyes shut. It’s merely a possibility. It won’t\nhappen. I will make certain it doesn’t happen. Yet these were the terms he’d\nagreed to: if he failed the contest of champions, he would lead Odium’s\narmies in their conquest of other worlds. Could he do that?\nHe’d given his word. Storms.\nSounds assaulted him. War, screams, soldiers dying. He refused to open\nhis eyes to it, and instead reached out. He was a Bondsmith. He could make\nbonds, find bonds, strengthen bonds. There was a strong bond for him here\nin this place …\nOr several?\nThree strong bonds. A few others nearly as strong. That was odd. What\nwas he Connected to in here aside from Navani? The Stormfather? No …\nthat bond was different. These others were bright, and … and close?\nBrilliant white lines spreading from him, one pointing to …\nA young man … no, an old man … no, a child … Elhokar? Was that\nElhokar?\nIt was gone in a moment, leaving him with a haunting echo. He tried to\nfollow, but found himself pulled toward another instead. A bond with\nsomeone whose love he didn’t deserve, yet sometimes still took for granted."

A bond with\nsomeone whose love he didn’t deserve, yet sometimes still took for granted.\nSomeone whose touch made him come alive, and whose smile made him a\nbetter man.\nShe was … there. He found Navani’s hand and opened his eyes to her,\nseeing her in a hundred different variations, one after another, everything\nfrom a young maiden to an aged queen. That smile—that knowing smile—\nremained the same.\n“We need another vision!” Dalinar shouted against the tide of images\nthat flowed around them like a current. “We need an anchor!”\n“Fortunately,” Navani shouted, “I thought of that!”\n“You did?”\nShe raised her hand, which was wrapped in a red ribbon. It stayed the\nsame, even though everything else about her shifted. “I got it from\nShalash!”\nStorms, she was amazing. He touched the ribbon and felt it guiding\nthem, just as the stone had. The realm seemed to calm.\n“Navani,” Dalinar said, “the Stormfather offered to take us out and … I\nrefused him.” He met her eyes. “He’s frightened of what we might discover.\nThat alone is enough to encourage me to seek it. I’m sorry. I should have\nconsulted you.”\nShe nodded, accepting that. “Time remaining?”\nHe glanced at his arm. “Five days. I am convinced the Stormfather is\ndeliberately hiding the secret of how to absorb and use Honor’s power. To\nfind it …”\n“We must find our way to the day Honor died,” Navani agreed. “We\nmust witness the fall of the Knights Radiant and the death of the Almighty.”\nDalinar nodded. “The Stormfather said that the power would never\napprove of me, because ‘it cannot stand another who would do what Honor\ndid.’”\nNavani lifted the ribbon as a vision began to coalesce around them.\n“With the right anchors,” she said, “we can jump forward through time and\nlocate the right vision. We know the names of some of the Radiants\ninvolved in the Recreance—someone named Melishi was a Bondsmith\nthen.”\n“Thank you,” Dalinar said, holding her hands.\n“I’m still not sure what I think of our goal here,” she said. “I don’t want\nto lose you.”\n“I know,” he said. “At least I’m trying something new. Your way. Less\nwar, more scholarship.”\n“This is more history than it is engineering,” she said as the vision\nlocked into place. “So: Jasnah’s way more than mine. But … it is good to be\nsearching for answers rather than simply charging forward and hoping\neverything works out.”\nThe chaos had fully stabilized now. The two of them were in a dark room\nwith a dirt floor. A fire burned in the center, giving a primal kind of light to\nthe scene. Jezrien, looking older than the last time they’d seen him, sat on\nthe ground by the fire with Ishar and a few others. Shalash, now appearing\nto be an older teen, wore that same ribbon in her hair. Ishar somehow\nseemed more weathered than the others, with haggard eyes and a white\nbeard.\nThe woman Dalinar assumed was Chanaranach, with brilliant red hair"

She wore makeshift carapace\narmor. Her right hand rested on the hilt of a primitive sword—made from\nsharpened pieces of carapace embedded into wood. Again, her safehand—\nlike those of the other women in the room—was exposed.\nThere was no door to the room, just a hanging cloth, and someone pulled\nit back, allowing sunlight to enter. “He’s here,” the person said, and Dalinar\nwas glad to—this time—be able to understand the language.\nJezrien turned to Dalinar. “Well,” he said. “It is time to make a decision.”\n“Then,” Dalinar said, “make a decision we shall.”\nHe was shocked how effortless it felt to fall into playing along with the\nvision. The first times he’d done this, he’d felt so awkward. Now it was\nalmost second nature to start manipulating the conversation.\n“You say it so easily,” Jezrien said.\n“I’ve had a long time to think,” Dalinar said, careful not to be too\nspecific or committal. He couldn’t afford to let this vision fall apart until he\nhad another anchor to move forward in time once more. “But still, a\nsolution eludes me. Outline the problem for me, as we know it, one final\ntime?”\n“A wise choice,” Ishar said, settling down with them, and then he held\nhis hands before himself in an odd gesture, palms up. It evidently meant\nsomething to the others, but merely speaking their language didn’t provide\nDalinar with the accompanying cultural context. “As always, Kalak, your\ncalm sense of reason is encouraging. How is it no decision, no matter how\npainful, ever seems to upset you?”\n“I’m simply good at hiding it,” Dalinar said.\n“You’re too calm,” Chana said, sitting. She gave an odd sweeping\ngesture with her hand, her fingers wriggling. “You always have been\nshoshau. Makes me want to do something to upset you.” She smiled, and\nthat word, shoshau … he half understood it. Some kind of idiom?\nNext to Dalinar, Navani gave him a look, which—because he knew her\n—he thought he could read. She was impressed. Delicate conversation had\nnever been his strongest talent. But … well, time and experience could\nmake a diplomat even from an old whitespine like him, apparently.\n“Our people,” Jezrien said from beside the fire, “continue to push against\nthe confines set by the singers. Fifty years, and already war is starting.\nInevitable.”\n“I would not find our way to it again,” said the last person at the fire—an\nAlethi-looking woman, in green, with long black hair. “After what\nhappened last time …” She closed her eyes, and a soft glow came from her.\n“Prayers. Prayers, heavens, and songs …”\nDalinar started. Navani’s eyes went wide. That wasn’t Stormlight, but it\nfelt similar. That was control of the Surges, centuries before the Knights\nRadiant. The action seemed to attract a spren—a glowing figure forming"

        "text": "felt similar. That was control of the Surges, centuries before the Knights\nRadiant. The action seemed to attract a spren—a glowing figure forming\nbehind her, in the darkness. Something was familiar about it, like … an\necho of something Dalinar had seen earlier.\nIt vanished a second later.\n“We won’t let it go that far, Vedel,” Jezrien promised, speaking to the\nwoman as she stopped glowing.\n“But high heavens and beasts below!” Chana said. “We have to do\nsomething, Your Majesty. Thirty people slaughtered?” Angerspren boiled\naround her—plainly by this time, humans had started attracting spren,\nunlike the last vision.\n“Not our people,” Ishar said, making another odd gesture, two fingers\nup. “Makibak’s rebels.”\nShalash glared at him. “You’ll start another war with them. With Nale.”\n“They’re not our people,” Ishar said, repeating the gesture. “They never\nhave been, child.”\n“Bah!” Ash said, standing up. “I’m tired of being called that!” She\ntugged at the ribbon in her hair, then turned and stalked toward the door.\n“My precious one,” Jezrien said, reaching toward her. But she was gone\na second later.\nJezrien started to go after her. Vedel—the Herald Vedeledev—put a hand\non Jezrien’s shoulder. She was the Herald of Healing, by their lore, a master\nof mind and soul who held the keys of immortality. “She might not be able\nto see that maturity comes more slowly for her, because of what\nSurgebinding did to us, but she is also correct. She isn’t a child any longer.”\nHe nodded, taking a deep breath.\n“I’ll talk to her later,” Chana said, gesturing with both palms upward.\n“But we have important matters to discuss. Ishar is right. Makibak and his\nrebels are a different nation.”\n“All humans are our people, Ishar, Chana,” Jezrien said. “Regardless of\nethnicity or background. But … you are right too. We can’t simply let this\ngo.” He looked to Navani, then to Dalinar. “Kalak? Pralla? Thoughts?”\n“So,” Dalinar said carefully. “Thirty humans were killed by singers, as\nour peoples clash. And they have … been treating us poorly.”\n“Confining us to these lands,” Chana said, “where barely anything\ngrows. If we move to the east, where they have their fine stone-sung\nbuildings and food in abundance, they demand we serve them. That might\nhave been enough for the first generation, Kalak—they knew only war and\nfire. But the younger generation who have grown up here? They can’t stand\nit.”\nDalinar nodded. He knew the context now, could place this vision. They\nall sat for a short time, and he didn’t prompt them to say anything else.\nThey’d jumped forward barely fifty years—and he’d need to be able to take\nmuch greater leaps if he wanted to reach the Recreance. He covertly\nchecked his clock just in case, but found mere seconds had passed. Again,\nwhen he was in a vision, time stretched the other way—with the world\noutside moving at a crawl."

Again,\nwhen he was in a vision, time stretched the other way—with the world\noutside moving at a crawl.\n“I think,” Navani said to the others, “I could use some fresh air before\nwe make this decision.”\nSmart, a way to delay and get more bearings. The others accepted that,\nclimbing to their feet. As they stepped out, Dalinar found they’d been in\nsome kind of man-made cave. A room dug into a hillside, but one formed\nentirely of mud. They were in a … well, a kind of town of mud homes and\nmany tents. Those seemed to be hogshide—much thicker than cloth, and\nmore permanent than the tents he’d seen. They had one high point in the\ncenter, then sweeping hogshide sides that were eventually spiked to the soft\nground.\nThe humans here mostly resembled the Alethi or Vedens, some with\ndarker tan skin, some with lighter pale skin. He didn’t see anyone with dark\nbrown skin other than Shalash, nor did he see anyone other than her who\nlooked Shin. Their eyes were a variety of shades, more darkeyed than not.\nJezrien, who was darkeyed himself, was gazing toward a group of\nsingers a short distance away. “They’ll expect some kind of response,\nKalak. Shoshau. This comes to a head. Our people cannot be confined.”\n“There’s an answer other than war,” Navani said. “There has to be.”\n“If scholars like you ruled the world, Pralla,” Jezrien said, “then maybe\nthere would be. Take your breather, and drink the heavens’ fresh air. I will\ngreet the singers. Kalak, join me, once you have made up your mind.”\nHe walked away. Dalinar turned, and noted what appeared to be fields of\ngrain out in the mud, but they were clearly struggling. Meager stalks of\nsomething growing in rows—no grass anywhere to be seen, a few tiny\nlifespren. At least the mud was mostly dry this time, packed under his feet.\nJezrien stopped a short distance from the singer contingent, who looked\nfar better equipped, with strange stone weapons that were too honed to have\nbeen formed by chipping. The axe held by one near the front was so smooth\nit could have been Soulcast. Their clothing, while still primitive, was better\nconstructed than that of the humans. Cloth instead of furs, their leathers\nwell cured, their dyes vibrant.\nIt was … surreal. After all he’d been through, a part of him still imagined\nthe singers as the Parshendi or parshmen. As primitives, far less advanced\nthan the Alethi. Here that was dramatically different. Humans were barely\nsurviving, while the singers thrived.\nThis was their world.\n“The ribbon brought us here,” Navani said. “It’s somehow relevant to\nthis moment, this day. I don’t think we’ve seen why, but once we do, we\nwill likely be near the end of the vision. So we need another anchor.”\n“Maybe we can find something new to jump us all the way to the\nRecreance.”\n“The Radiants don’t even exist yet, gemheart,” Navani said. “I think"

But how? What anchor\ncould we find?”\n“I felt something when I touched that ribbon,” Navani said. “I wonder if\nI could use that sense to identify other possibilities. Our powers Connect us,\nbut can also sense Connections …”\nHer saying it prompted Dalinar to reach for Stormlight, to see if he could\nagain form a web of light and lines around him. Immediately he had that\nsame strange impression as before, of a bond he didn’t recognize. This time\nhe moved. He reached out with both hands as a shimmer of light appeared\n—which he seized. A part of him felt like he was reaching for Elhokar’s\nghost. Instead he found a child.\nGavinor. His grandnephew.\n“Gav?” Dalinar said, pulling the child to him.\nThe little boy—wide-eyed—gasped. He grabbed hold of Dalinar,\ngripping tightly. “Grampa. You found me.”\nDalinar held to him, baffled, and glanced at Navani. Was this some\nstrange manifestation of the Spiritual Realm? She put her hand to the boy’s\nface, looking deeply into his eyes, and Dalinar saw lines of light extending\nfrom her—a strong one touching the boy.\n“I think it’s really him,” Navani said. “Gavinor? What happened?”\nGav whimpered in Dalinar’s lap. How would others react to a child\nappearing with them?\n“I’m sorry,” the boy whimpered. “I was watching. I didn’t want to be\nleft. I snuck away from Mararin and I watched you in the basement. Then\nthere was light, and … and …”\nDalinar groaned.\nLittle Gav cringed. “Don’t be angry, Grampa. Don’t be angry.”\n“It’s not the child’s fault, Dalinar,” Navani said. “We opened the portal.\nWe tried this insane plan.”\n“He’s in serious danger though,” Dalinar said. “He snuck away from his\nminder, and now … Storms. We have to get him back to safety!”\n“Yes, but anger won’t change anything.”\nDamnation. She was right. He didn’t like this, but Gav couldn’t be made\nto feel he was a problem. Dalinar pulled Gav closer into an embrace. “Gav.\nI’m not angry, not at you. I’m angry at myself for letting this happen. I’m\nglad we found you.”\nThe boy buried his face in Dalinar’s chest. “I was with Mother again,” he\nwhispered. “Over and over. I hate those red spren …”\n“Is there any way we can send him to safety?” Navani asked Dalinar.\n“Maybe the Stormfather?”"

For now … maybe\nwe should find an anchor, so at least we don’t get trapped in the Spiritual\nRealm.”\nNavani took Gav, because she obviously wanted to comfort him. A\nsoldier walked past, wearing furs and carrying a crude stone spear. “What\nan odd spren …” he said, eyeing Gav. Then he seemed embarrassed,\nnoticing the two of them. “Sorry, Surgebinders. Sorry.” He made an\nawkward gesture with one hand out as he bowed, then hurried away.\n“Spren?” Navani said.\n“I yanked him into the vision abruptly,” Dalinar said. “The vision will\ntry to adapt, and maybe the best way for it to account for someone\nappearing out of nowhere is to give them the appearance of a spren to the\npeople of the vision.”\n“Ah …” Navani said. “You must be right. And you claim not to be a\nscholar.”\n“I keep good company,” Dalinar said.\n“Grampa?” Gav said, squeezing his eyes shut. “A spren? I don’t like\nspren.”\n“It’s all pretend, Gav,” Navani said. “This place? It’s just a story. We’re\nliving in a story.” She paused, then continued. “You remember when\nShallan made the story of the axehounds appear from light? And you got to\nplay with them?”\nGav opened his eyes. “Yes. Yes, I liked that.”\n“This is the same,” Navani said. “A story of long ago, made for fun.\nExactly like the Lightweaving.”\nGav nodded, and seemed much less frightened as he let her hold him.\n“You,” Dalinar said, “are a genius.”\n“We’ll see,” Navani said. “There’s no telling when the vision will break\napart. We should divide our time. I’ll poke around and see if I can find\nanything that might Connect us to this location, but in the near future.”\n“I’ll talk to the other Heralds,” Dalinar said. “And try to find something\nConnecting us to the day they became Heralds.”\nDalinar jogged over to Jezrien and the others. A tall singer at the front of\ntheir group stepped forward as Dalinar arrived. He was a malen of black\nand red carapace, with a long face, gemstones in his beard. He was old,\nwhich you could tell not only by the wrinkles on his face, but also by the\nwhitening of his carapace around the edges.\n“My friend,” the singer said to Dalinar with a pronounced smile. Broader\nthan singers usually gave, perhaps as an exaggeration for human eyes.\n“Kalak, you have barely aged. I had not thought the stories to be true, yet\nhere you stand. Twenty years since last we parted, and you are still the same\nman I saw when you passed into this world fifty years ago.”"

Twenty years since last we parted, and you are still the same\nman I saw when you passed into this world fifty years ago.”\nJezrien looked to him, and Dalinar remembered he was supposed to be\nmaking a decision. He met the king’s eyes and nodded. He still didn’t know\nexactly what he was deciding, but he projected confidence.\nJezrien held out a hand upward, and seemed questioning. Dalinar, after a\nmoment’s thought, mimicked the gesture. Jezrien took that with a grim\nexpression, but nodded and turned back to the singer. “Are we finally going\nto talk about the problem, Elodi? Or are we going to reminisce?”\n“I prefer to reminisce,” Elodi said, his gaze moving to study the town.\n“You are making this place yours, Jezrien. There is so much room to\nexpand.”\n“Wasteland,” Jezrien said. “Barely anything can grow.”\n“Your people are welcome in the east.”\n“As servants,” Dalinar said. “Practically slaves.”\n“How else will you learn our ways? Wise children sit at the feet of their\nfathers.” Elodi stepped closer to Jezrien. Chana moved to block him, but\nJezrien waved her off. Dalinar would not have expected a female bodyguard\nduring this era, but her job was obvious.\nElodi spoke softly, to a sharp rhythm. “This is bad, my friends,” he said,\nregarding each of them. “Very bad.”\n“Thirty of my kind are dead,” Jezrien said.\n“In retribution for theft and the murder of a singer,” Elodi replied. “Your\npeople encroach upon the hunting grounds to the east. Some among my\nkind are starting to refer to humans as pests. Like a cremling worm in our\ngrain. I have not … heard such vitriol before. Ever.” He eyed the sky.\n“There is a darkness growing in this land. New gods, Jezrien. I do not like\nthe words of the new gods. But the old ones are losing their voices …”\n“Can you calm your people?” Jezrien asked.\n“Can you contain yours?”\n“We cannot, Elodi,” Jezrien said. “Most do not accept me as king. To be\nhonest, many hate me. I cannot stop them.”\n“They will start a war.”\nJezrien glanced at Dalinar, as if for backup. So, Dalinar took the\nopportunity—crude though he knew it was—to try something. “Maybe,” he\nsaid, “if Honor were to bless us in some way—show us how to contain our\npowers as Surgebinders—we could lead the people again, and regain their\ntrust. Then perhaps we could prevent war.”\nNearby, Ishar gasped. Jezrien put his hand to a pouch tied to his belt.\n“How do you know about that?” he hissed, drawing shockspren.\n“It is just something I’ve been thinking,” Dalinar said.\n“This is not the time,” Ishar said. “We will talk later. Elodi, if there has\nto be war … then there has to be war.”\n“Makibak and his rebels are proud,” Jezrien said, making a gesture with\ntwo fingers. “But they are good people, and I cannot blame them for their"

My people are dying in this mud pit.”\n“Better than burning on your old world.”\n“This one will come to flames as well, soon. I can’t halt it, but I think\nyou might be able to. The singers listen to you.”\nElodi looked to the sky again. “And I listen to the old gods. The Wind,\nthe Stone. They whisper for me to go east, to leave this pile of tinder before\nthe bonfire begins.”\n“In leaving,” Jezrien said, “you take with you every hint of common\nsense left to the singer nation. There will be war.”\n“There’s already war, my friend,” Elodi said. “Stay on your side of the\nmountains.”\n“I don’t think we can do that, Elodi,” Jezrien said. “Not if humans are\ndying.”\n“Then pray that I do leave for the east, so we do not meet again,” Elodi\nsaid. “My people are listening to your god these days. I hope to drown out\nhis voice with the Rhythm of Peace, but …”\nElodi gave them one last glance, then gathered his people and left.\nHiking away.\n“Gwythiadri!” Jezrien snapped once he was gone. A … curse word?\nDalinar thought it might be a name. Jezrien turned and stalked back toward\nthe dugout. Ishar and Chana gave chase. Nearby, Dalinar spotted Shalash\nstanding with her hands clasped, watching the singers retreat. Past her,\nNavani was speaking with some people near a cookfire. Gav sat next to her,\nand while some passed by and noticed him, nobody found him too odd.\nThe boy being here made Dalinar anxious. Gavinor had been through so\nmuch—being abandoned to evil spren by one parent, then losing the other\nmoments later. Dalinar reached out again to the Stormfather, but got no\nresponse.\nWell, Cultivation had sent him here. He had to trust in that, and in his\ninstincts. It was not a burden he wanted, but he had never wanted any of\nthis. Roshar needed a king, and so a king he would be. He strode up to the\ndugout, determined to find an anchor to continue their quest.\nI have kept my part of the bargain, and will not be budged. I have\nstayed upon my land, bringing blessings to the people of Nalthis\n—gifting them the power of gods, as I was so long denied. I do\nnot repeat the mistakes of the past.\nSigzil soared beneath a black-clouded sky with five of his squires. Thunder\ncrashed above, accompanied by red flashes—like the cracked knuckles of a\ngod preparing to come in for the kill.\nThey intercepted the squad of Heavenly Ones, forcing them to abandon\nthe boulders they’d been carrying—which otherwise would have fallen on\nthe defenders of Narak.

Where once they’d\npaired off against Windrunners and fought aerial duels, now three ganged\nup on one of his squires, each exchange furious and brutal.\nThere had been deaths in previous clashes, but those had been rare. Not\nanymore. After one day, Sigzil had already lost eight Windrunners. Eight.\nHe Lashed himself straight toward the beleaguered squire, Rowalan, and\nengaged all three of his foes, Shardspear a silvery sweeping arc in the air. It\nreshaped into a glaive as he fought, matching those carried by the Azish\nImperial Guard.\nHis attacks drove the enemy back. He was extra careful to keep an eye\nout for any daggers that warped the air. So far, none of the enemy carried\nthose weapons that could kill spren—but scientists at Urithiru were working\novertime to perfect the methodology, and he was certain the enemy was\ndoing the same. With the fate of the world at stake, it wouldn’t be long\nbefore prototypes of those weapons came to this battlefield.\nHis foes surrounded him, cautious, watching. Two lunged—and with a\ngrunt, Sigzil spun in the air, Lashing himself backward. Then, gathering his\nStormlight, he performed a calculated Lashing upward, his weapon\nlengthening to a lance. As he’d guessed, the third of the shanay-im had tried\nto dive in while Sigzil was distracted.\nSigzil countered, using multiple Lashings and thrusting upward, his\nlance going straight through the Heavenly One’s chest and piercing the\ngemheart. The malen’s Lashings continued carrying him downward—his\nburning eyes forming twin trails of smoke—as Sigzil pulled his weapon\nfree. Fused always looked surprised when he killed them, as if they couldn’t\nfully believe that a common man had bested their millennia of experience.\nFortunately for Sigzil, most of those millennia had been spent torturing\nHeralds rather than fighting.\nAs rain started to fall, the remaining five shanay-im broke off and fled\ninto the darkness. There was more to the reason he fought better here than\nhe had before; Sigzil had yet to see any of their best fighters. In\nHearthstone, Leshwi had almost killed him. Then she had let him go. He\nmissed those Heavenly Ones, who had not only been more honorable, but\nmore sane. It was almost as if maintaining a code throughout the centuries\nhad kept them from deteriorating.\n“Thoughts?” he asked.\n“Calculating their speeds …” Vienta said. “They have built to Heavenly\nOne stable cruising velocity. I believe they are retreating for real this time,\nrather than planning to double back.”\n“My gut says the same.”\n“Your gut?” she asked. “The same organ that tells you when to eat?”\n“It’s a human thing,” he replied, with a smile.\n“Nonsense,” she said. “Lots of animals have stomachs, not just humans,\nthough I’ve never thought to count the number of species.

        "text": "though I’ve never thought to count the number of species. Excellent\nfighting today, by the way.”\n“Thanks,” he said, as the Heavenly Ones vanished away beneath the\ncover of lightning. They were frighteningly effective at killing, but their\nmorale was weak. They preferred quick clashes that left the dead floating in\nthe air.\nSigzil soared to join his squires, who were healing wounds from the\nquick skirmish. “Storms,” Fent said. “Companylord, you fight like … like\nthe wind itself sometimes.”\n“Stormblessed’s training,” another squire, Deti, whispered.\nSigzil shot them a glare. They knew what he thought of them\nmythicizing him and the other members of Bridge Four. The pair shut up\nimmediately, saluting. For now, he sent them on patrol, then flew toward\nNarak to take battle reports. As he did, Leyten joined him.\n“Your plan is working, Sig,” Leyten said, giving the salute of the day as\nproof of his identity. “Decisively attacking those heading for our core\nplateaus diverted others to Narak Four. They ended up concentrating their\nefforts there.”\nNarak Four was the first of their intentional weak points, and Sigzil’s big\nmathematical gamble. Make the enemy waste resources taking ground that\nSigzil’s people could afford to lose.\n“Reports on the rest of our soldiers?” Sigzil asked.\n“None dead, Sig,” Leyten said. “But …”\n“What?”\n“There still hasn’t been a shipment of Stormlight from Urithiru.” They\nlocked eyes. Sigzil had been informed—and had in turn informed his\ncommand staff and generals—of Dalinar’s absence. He trusted the\nBondsmith to do what had to be done, but storms … they’d been counting\non Dalinar to offer a continually renewing supply of Stormlight.\nWithout that, Sigzil wasn’t certain they could hold this location, with or\nwithout his strategic plans.\n“We’d be better off,” Leyten said, “if we were at full force, so we could\nrest our Windrunners more between bouts. What was Dalinar thinking,\nsending over half our Windrunners to ferry troops during a time like this?”\n“He was keeping an oath, Leyten,” Sigzil said, landing on the boarded\nground of the platform—built up with wood, to put a barrier between their\nfeet and Deepest Ones who might be moving through the stone. The\nDeepest Ones could get through some other materials, but formerly living\nthings like wood slowed them significantly. “You know how important that\nis.”\nLeyten said nothing. Though normally of a cheerful disposition, the\ncurly-haired man looked haggard today. He’d lost a squire earlier in the\nmorning. Sigzil sent him off through the light rain, with a reminder that a\nhighstorm was expected before too long. Then he started taking reports\nfrom the scribes who had splashed through puddles and rainspren to join\nhim.\nThere were so many things to do when you were in charge. He’d barely\ntouched any of his experiments since Kaladin’s retirement two months ago.\nSigzil had imagined the freedom of being able to set his own schedule—to\nmake room for things like his large-scale project to determine how quickly"

He had the authority—well,\nwhen they weren’t mid-battle—to set up experiments, divert resources. It\nwas everything he needed, except time to attend in person. Right now, Ka\nshowed him enemy troop movements. They had brought some stormforms,\nwho had nearly managed to set one of the gates ablaze during the fighting.\nThe generals were considering having a Stoneward put up a wall to block\nthe gate entirely, but Sigzil worried that would box them in too much.\nNarak Two was their Oathgate—and he wanted his troops to be able to\nretreat across those bridges to Urithiru, if needed.\nOf course, those bridges—though made of stone—might not survive the\nfighting. He asked the generals to draw up alternative evacuation plans,\nthen had them warn everyone—yet again—of the impending highstorm.\nWinds could get extremely dangerous when the two storms met, and the\nEverstorm appeared to be here to stay.\nAfter that, he went to check on Narak Four—where the fighting had\nbeen most fierce—wondering idly about the Fused he’d just killed. He’d\nhave gone back to Braize, and it would take time for him to be reborn. That\nprocess usually required days, maybe weeks. But with the Everstorm\nparked here …\nIt could probably happen within hours, maybe faster.\nStorms. This was going to be a long five days. And he had no time for\nsuch worries as a group of Edgedancers returned, leaping the gaps between\nchasms using modified scouting poles, designed with greatly increased\nfriction at their ends.\nAnother offensive of Fused, primarily Magnified Ones, was coming—\nlooking like they were going to hit Narak Four, now that its gate had been\nweakened. It was playing out as he had hoped, but he would rather not lose\nthe plateau too quickly. It wasn’t that he wanted to give up ground; only\nthat when he was forced to, he wanted it to be ground they didn’t need.\nSo, Sigzil sounded the warning and took to the sky yet again, flying\nthrough an omnipresent darkness that was already starting to feel eternal.\nFive Heavenly Ones, led by Venli’s former master, Leshwi, had left Urithiru\nwith them. Now they sat alone around a small fire at the outskirts of the\nlistener settlement. Venli and Jaxlim approached them, joined by Thude,\none of the leaders of the listeners. The hulking warform malen had a pattern\nmade more of large marbled patches than lines. He wore the same long coat\nhe always had in the past, despite Bila’s mockery of it.\nStrangely, Venli occasionally stepped on sand: an oddity of the washed-\nout flatland east of the Shattered Plains. Water flooded out this way, and it\nmade ripples on the ground nearest the chasms—depositing crem there.\nAdditionally, you ended up with these pockets of sand.

Venli had never seen\nanything like it, although she’d been told some beaches had similar\ngeology.\nLeshwi stood up as Venli and the others approached. Over the last few\ndays, the powers of the five Heavenly Ones had given out … something\nthat shouldn’t have happened.\n“Leshwi,” Thude said to Appreciation, with Venli translating into Alethi\nfor the Fused, “we would speak with you. Would you walk with us a\nmoment?”\nLeshwi looked to each of them in turn. Her once fine attire of flowing\nrobes and long trains had been cut away by force of necessity. Now she\nstood in clothing that, up top, was still regal—but below her knees it was\ncovered in crem and stuck with sand. She didn’t have proper footwear, only\nan intricate wrap that started at her thighs and continued down around her\nfeet.\nShe fell into step with them as they walked back among the community\nof listeners. One of the chasmfiends opened an eye and inspected Venli as\nshe passed, but then returned to snoring. The alliance between chasmfiends\nand listeners was something Venli couldn’t get a straight answer about—the\nothers were suspicious of her, and rightly so. Timbre had been speaking to\nthe chasmfiends though, and claimed to be close to figuring it out.\n“I suspect I know the meaning of this intervention,” Leshwi said. Her\nrhythm was one of Odium’s twisted ones, the Rhythm of Conceit. “If you\ninsist, we will go on our way. Our presence here is dangerous to you and\nyours.”\nThude hummed to Anxiety. “That isn’t what we were going to suggest,\nLeshwi.”\n“Isn’t it?” The tall Fused had an imperious way of speaking, even when\nshe was obviously trying not to be domineering. “If my servants had\nattracted Odium’s ire, I would not have thought twice about casting them\nout. Yet here I am, essentially a servant to you—or at least a suffered\nvisitor.” She stopped, gazing down at her feet in the sand. “I do not know\nmy place anymore. I am … unaccustomed to walking.”\n“Your Light ran out,” Venli said, excited. “It’s an oddity, correct?”\n“Yes,” Leshwi whispered. “Normally, a Heavenly One can fly as long as\nshe wants, without the Light ever running out, unless she uses it for Lashing\nsomething else. Mine running out means he’s coming for us.”\n“Maybe,” Venli said. “Or maybe you’re not as attuned to his power as\nyou once were. Radiants, as their oaths increase, can hold Stormlight better.\nAnd Fused?”\n“We have no such gradations,” Leshwi said. “We are simply his. And\nalways have been.”\n“Until now,” Jaxlim said.\nThe four of them halted, surrounded by listeners going about their daily\nduties. It had been Jaxlim’s idea: to bring Leshwi among them to remind\nher of the people she’d come to join, and let her hear their peaceful\nrhythms.\n“The old songs,” Thude said, “mention that we, in abandoning Odium"

If you want to\njoin us, Leshwi, you have to do the same.”\n“Give up the sky?” Leshwi said to Agony.\n“If that’s what it takes,” Jaxlim said to Peace, “then yes.”\nLeshwi raised her eyes. “I don’t know if I’m capable,” she whispered. “I\nhave seen thousands of years. I at times feel more spren than singer.\nWalking like this makes me wince with each step. I cannot change.”\n“You already have, Leshwi,” Venli said.\n“This is what it is to be a listener,” Jaxlim said. “To reject their conflict.\nWe belong to no god save Roshar itself.”\n“And the stones that make it …” Venli whispered.\n“The stones,” Leshwi said softly. “Once, long ago, our ancestors\nworshipped the spren of the stones. By the time I was a young girl, my kind\nhad turned to Odium, once spren and Honor abandoned us.” She hummed\nto another corrupted rhythm. “But it wasn’t ever that simple, was it? Some\nspren stood with humans, others stood apart, others still listened to us. It\nwas a mess … It always has been.”\n“Join us,” Venli said. “Truly.”\n“Is it really possible though?” Leshwi asked. “For all your thoughts of\nisolation, you were manipulated to his ends as soon as he wanted you.” She\nglanced to them. “It is not the same for a Fused as it is for all of you. I am\nbound to Odium. I can perhaps reject him verbally—but he would retain a\nhold on me. He could make my existence miserable next time I die. It is a\n… difficult thing you ask.”\n“It is,” Jaxlim said. And left it at that.\nVenli wanted to push, but she trusted her mother’s wisdom. Leshwi\nnodded to them and hummed to Praise—not in acceptance of their demand,\nbut in acknowledgment that they were trying to help. She walked off, and\nVenli didn’t know if she noticed that she’d used one of the old rhythms. Not\none of Odium’s. Leshwi did that sometimes, as Venli had—off and on—\nduring her days finding her way out.\nIf Venli had managed it, Leshwi could. For although Leshwi was Fused,\na soul permanently bound to Odium’s service, Venli found it difficult to\nbelieve anyone could be farther gone than she had been herself.\n“She will make the right choice,” Jaxlim said to Resolve.\n“How do you know?” Thude asked.\n“Because it’s her choice to make,” Venli said, grasping what her mother\nmeant. “And so her choice is the right one. We will respect it.”"

She had\nspent years blaming Eshonai; how strange to realize that all Venli truly\nneeded to do to win her mother’s praise was … well, be worthy of it.\n“Come,” Thude said to her. “Your spren has been asking about the\nchasmfiends and how all of this came about. You’ve proven yourself true,\nby the bonds and spren you have brought to us. I have been given\npermission from the rest of the Five to explain how we did it.”\nAt last. Venli nodded, eager, humming to Excitement.\n“We didn’t have a keeper of songs once Jaxlim fell ill,” Thude said to\nEmbarrassment, “so I had to compose this one myself. I call it the Song of\nthe Beasts, the story of our final decision to make peace with the creatures.\nI’m sorry if it’s uneven or amateur.”\n“It’s wonderful,” Jaxlim said. “I love what you’ve done, Thude. Please.\nShare it with my daughter.”\nSo, Thude started singing.\nTWENTY-THREE YEARS AGO\nSzeth-son-Neturo no longer danced with the wind.\nHad there been magic in his steps, in the breeze, in the music of the\nlandscape? Or had he been a silly boy determined to make profound what\nwas actually awkward and simple? The boys of the practice yards outside\nthe Stoneward monastery left him with no such confusion. They lined up to\nprove themselves against him, and Szeth laid each one in the dust.\nThe latest challenger was Jormo-son-Falk. Name notwithstanding, the\nlight-skinned youth seemed the son of a mountain. Fortunately, three years\nin the practice yards had taught Szeth true. Strength and reach were distinct\nadvantages. Every advantage was also a liability, when you depended on it\ntoo much.\nJormo came in swinging, trusting in his greater weight and momentum.\nSzeth refused to be caught in the momentum of life, or of battle.\nMomentum carried those who didn’t wonder, didn’t stop to question.\nQuestions like “What is right?”\nOr perhaps questions like “Shouldn’t I be approaching more carefully?”\nSzeth barely had to shove Jormo—catching him shield-on-shield,\nstepping to the side to dodge a wild strike from the man’s sword—in order\nto trip him. Jormo ended up face-first in the dirt, dust rising from him in a\npuff. Laughter erupted from the watching youths—all officers in training\nlike Szeth. Mostly children of other officers. As the Voice had said, those in\nthe camp tended to fulfill their own expectations.\nJormo pushed himself up and spat dirt. His glance toward Szeth carried\nthunderous implications—toughs like him did not like to be defeated by\nsomeone smaller and younger.

He probably should have let Jormo beat him.\nNo, the Voice said.\n“No?” Szeth asked as Jormo got to his feet.\nNo, the Voice replied. You cannot run from men like Jormo forever.\nSzeth wasn’t certain when the Voice had begun reading his mind. It had\nhappened gradually over the last few years.\nHit him when he comes for you, the Voice said. Hard this time.\nJormo grabbed his shield and practice sword—iron, as they all had to get\nused to holding metal, but not edged—and came for Szeth again. More\ncautious, testing forward. Other soldiers leaned over the fence surrounding\nthe sparring grounds, calling to him, but that cacophony became a soft\nbuzzing to Szeth.\nTime for the dance. He exchanged blows with Jormo, each trying to\nintercept the other’s hits with their shield, the two spinning around one\nanother as they swung. A brutal affair, exactly as Szeth had imagined\nfighting to be.\nYet it was a dance. Szeth had learned the steps by brute force of practice\neach and every evening, while the others relaxed. He did it right. He had to\ndo it right. Some people whispered of supernatural skill on his part, that he\nwas too capable for a boy of fourteen. That angered him. It made luck out of\nsweat. He hated it when they pretended he was something special. He\nwasn’t.\nThat was the point.\nJormo left an opening, slipping his shield too low as he tried a rush.\nSzeth clipped him on the helmet, then dodged the youth’s follow-up blow.\nSzeth’s next hit went to Jormo’s side, directly where the jerkin was tied, a\nweak point in the armor. The blow forced the stiff leather against his ribs,\ncausing him to huff in pain. Szeth struck the leg next, a precise hit on the\nthigh just above the leather greave.\nJormo went down once more, sprawling, dazed.\nHit him! the Voice demanded.\nSzeth hesitated.\nJormo howled and heaved himself at Szeth’s legs, toppling him, though\ngrappling was forbidden. Szeth had not practiced this kind of fighting.\nKammar, the art of fighting with hands, was for the shamans or those who\nhad already mastered the sword.\nJormo grabbed Szeth by the head and slammed it against the ground,\nshouting. The rim of Szeth’s helmet bit into his neck, and he struggled,\ntasting dirt and blood as Jormo again slammed him to the ground. Szeth’s\nfingers found something next to him. A rock, half buried in the dirt, kicked\nloose by the sparring. His fingers locked onto it, smooth and rough all at\nonce, alien.\nHe gripped it.\nThen let go.\nNo, he thought. Not again.\nHe had lost control once. Death had followed.\nHe would never lose control again.\nNEVER.\nShouts. Jormo was pulled off Szeth, who lay disheveled on the ground,"

Jormo was pulled off Szeth, who lay disheveled on the ground,\nhis lip bleeding where he’d bitten it, helmet askew, though it had done its\njob. As he shook his head and cleared his tears, he found he was largely\nuninjured.\nWe are going to have to do something about this, Szeth, the Voice said.\nHow can you defend this land if you hold back?\n“That will be different,” Szeth said, standing.\nAhead of them, Sergeant Szrand berated Jormo. “If you lose control like\nthat, you’ll end up becoming what all those people think we are!” His wave\nwas toward the lowlands, but he didn’t need the gesture, as the phrase those\npeople never referred to anyone else. The “sheep,” as soldiers called them.\nTo Szeth it did not seem a healthy relationship on either side—but he\nsaid nothing. His betters, like the Farmer and the General, must know what\nthey were doing.\nThe sergeant pushed Jormo away, and Szeth thought that maybe the\nyouth would be suitably disciplined—and therefore not seek revenge. Then\nagain, this was the same camp that had trained the soldiers who had killed\nMolli … so Szeth decided he’d best sleep on the roof anyway. Discipline\nwas getting better now that his father was the General’s aide-de-camp, but\none man could only do so much.\n“You,” Sergeant Szrand said, looking at Szeth. “Always causing\ntrouble.”\nSzeth froze, not liking the tone of the sergeant’s voice. He was a thick\nman—thick of arm, thick of thigh, thick of waist. Thick of wit. With deep\nbrown skin and hair that puffed out when he removed his helmet.\nSzeth had always thought him jovial, even if the sergeant had never been\nable to explain footings properly. Szeth had needed to go to some of the\ncamp’s shaman acolytes—who trained with the Honorbearers—to learn. An\nodd bunch, the shamans. Holy enough to walk on stone, because they\nshared its divine nature. The opposite of the soldiers, yet placed alongside\nthem.\nSzrand was still glaring at him.\n“… Sergeant?” Szeth asked.\n“Always a problem,” the taller man said, striding up to Szeth. “Always\ngoading people. Always acting like you’re better than they are.”\n“But I am better than they are,” Szeth said. “I rarely lose a bout, and\nnever three out of five against the same boy. I defeat people several years\nolder than I am.”\nThe sergeant glared at him.\n“You know it is true,” Szeth continued, his head cocked. “You know I\nhave to go to the acolytes for proper training, as I’ve outgrown your\nteaching.”\n“I want sixteen laps around the entire field, Szeth,” the sergeant said,\npointing. “When you’re done with that, I’ll have thought of your next\npunishment.”\n“I did nothing wrong,” Szeth said.\n“Sixteen laps!”\nSzeth didn’t move. Then, softly, he whispered, “Should I do it?”\nWhat do you think? the Voice replied.\n“Just tell me.”"

He was still uncertain whether he trusted the\nVoice or not. He worried it might be a trickster spren, as spoken of in lore.\n“Well?” Sergeant Szrand bellowed.\n“No,” Szeth said. “I will not accept punishment for having done no\nwrong.”\n“Boy,” Szrand said, stepping closer, speaking under his breath, “don’t\npush me. This will calm the situation for everyone.”\n“Is it right?”\n“Right is what I say is right.”\n“If that were true,” Szeth said, “then you’d know the proper way to train\nyour students.”\nSzrand hissed softly. He walked over and seized a practice sword and\nshield from a watching student. Szeth sighed. So, he’d made the wrong\nchoice.\nThe sergeant, to his credit, did get the first hit, but that was because\nSzeth initially held back. After taking a sharp blow on the arm and realizing\nthat Szrand was not doing him the same favor, he left the man groaning on\nthe ground and holding his leg.\nSzeth stood over him wondering if an adult would act out of the same\npetty sense of revenge that a youth did. Maybe Szeth should sleep on\nsomeone else’s roof for a while.\nSo, the Voice said, you are not impossibly timid.\n“Is this what you’d have done?” Szeth whispered.\nFor insulting me and acting above me? I’d have gone much further,\nSzeth. But you are young, and you are learning.\nSzeth pulled off the training armor, then left it with his sword and shield\non the rack. He supposed that now he had done something wrong in hurting\nthe sergeant. Besides, he was supposed to obey orders, so he started jogging\nthe laps. It felt good to be moving, although a sense of dread chased him.\nHe hadn’t been in the wrong, but had he let not being wrong … well, make\nhim wrong?\nHis mother stopped him halfway through the third lap. She arrived with\na waterskin, waving him down as he rounded the southern tip of the\nencampment.\n“More laps?” she said as he jogged over to her, puffing.\nHe nodded, accepting the waterskin. How she found him at times like\nthis puzzled him. He settled on a rock and drank, as he knew she wouldn’t\nbe satisfied until he’d taken a break.\nThree years had passed, and it still felt wrong for his mother to not be\nwearing a splash of color. Father, Szeth, even Elid … they’d all taken to this\nlife. Mother, though, seemed dull without color.\n“Why do you push yourself so hard, Szeth?” she asked.\n“I am here,” he said.\nShe looked confused by that answer. He wasn’t certain why—he was\nhere, so he would do as the place demanded. Yes, he missed dancing. Yes,\nhe missed the sheep, and the grass, and the solitude.

He\nrarely brought it out, and never with the other boys around, but he did\nalways keep it nearby.\n“Some of the recruits, when they wash out, are sent away to other kinds\nof work,” Mother said.\n“Never back to normal lives though,” Szeth said. “They’re sent to labor\nin the mines or things like that.”\n“Would it be so bad?” his mother asked. “To have solid work again?”\n“To wash out that hard, Mother,” Szeth said, “I’d have to be\nincompetent.”\nShe didn’t reply, but turned to stare out over the valley. He didn’t often\npause to gaze in that direction. Toward the past. She thought it beautiful.\n“How did you know I was out?” he asked. “Did Elid tell you?” Running\nlaps took him by the kitchens and their wide, open windows that let in the\ncool air. His sister was observant, although the truth was the other scullery\nmaids knew she liked to watch for him. So one of them had probably told\nher, then covered for her as she went to tell his mother.\nHe found it odd how quickly people did things like that for Elid. She\nbarely cared about her duties, yet everyone helped and welcomed her. Szeth\nwas impeccable in his duty, and the others all jeered him. With more time\nthough, he was certain he’d pick out the nuances. There were rules to every\nsituation; he merely didn’t know these ones yet.\nHe soon finished, thanked her for the water, and returned to running. He\nprobably wouldn’t see her again today, as she went to bed early … while\nFather usually stayed up late with his work. Szeth … had noticed that they\nwere rarely in the same room together these days.\nEventually, he finished the laps and went to the practice yards for the\nsecond stage of his punishment. It was worse than he’d imagined: a note\ntelling him to report to the General’s office. The few boys assigned to oil\nthe equipment didn’t meet his eyes. He felt alone, like a mouse on a barren\nfield, constantly looking toward the sky.\nHe’d never been summoned to the General’s office for discipline. Szeth\nslipped into the office, passing the cages of the General’s messenger\nparrots, and was confronted by the sight of his father behind the desk\noutside the General’s room.\nSzeth’s father always seemed too solid to belong behind a desk. A man\nlike Neturo should be out in the sunlight, like a stone basking in the\nelements. Yet here he was, going through the General’s appointment books,\nannotating procedures, coming up with ways to make the camp more\nefficient. Szeth supposed it was a high honor—people talked as though it\nwas. Father ate meals with the General and attended his most important\nmeetings.\n“Father,” Szeth said.\n“Ah, son,” Neturo said, glancing up and smiling."

Father ate meals with the General and attended his most important\nmeetings.\n“Father,” Szeth said.\n“Ah, son,” Neturo said, glancing up and smiling.\nSzeth let some of the tension melt from his shoulders. As long as his\nfather could smile, maybe it wasn’t as bad as Szeth had feared.\n“Just a sec,” Neturo said, quickly making a few notations in his ledger.\nThen he stood up and walked over to give Szeth a hug. “Hard day?”\n“Yes,” Szeth whispered.\n“I hear you laid Szrand on his ass,” his father said, pulling back from the\nhug but holding Szeth by the shoulders to inspect him.\nSzeth blushed, but nodded.\n“Fourteen years old,” Neturo said, “and making fools of men twice your\nweight. Remarkable.”\n“You aren’t … mad?”\n“I am a little,” Neturo admitted. “But Szrand is a buffoon. I’m working\nout a retirement plan for him. I think I’ll put Yago-son-Yargo in his place,\nbut he’s getting up in age. When he retires in five years or so, we’ll need a\nnew master of the training grounds. Someone who will listen to orders and\ntrain the new boys properly.”\n“You want that to be me?” Szeth said. “Father, I don’t think the other\nboys would let that happen. They don’t … they don’t like me.”\n“It wouldn’t be for some time yet,” Father said. “Those boys training\nwith you now, well, they will be assigned to other locations by then. The\nold guard will retire, and the new guard will take their spots. I think … I\nthink I can make a real home for us here, son. A place your mother can\nenjoy.”\n“Does this have to do with why she often leaves the room when you\nenter?” Szeth blurted the words, but felt stupid for saying them. Like\npointing out a stain on someone’s shirt.\nNeturo glanced away. “Maybe, maybe.” He took a deep breath.\n“Anyway, you’d like a permanent post here, wouldn’t you? At the training\ngrounds?”\n“I wouldn’t have to go fight,” Szeth whispered. “I wouldn’t have to kill\n…”\n“That’s a good thing, isn’t it?” Father asked, suddenly seeming\nconcerned.\n“Wonderful,” Szeth whispered.\nFather bobbed his head eagerly. “Come on.” He led the way, but not into\nthe General’s chambers. Out of the building.\n“Father?” Szeth said. “Didn’t the General send for me? To discipline me\nfor fighting earlier?”\n“That? Oh, that wasn’t your fault. The General doesn’t know about it. I\nsent for you myself—something important is happening today. It doesn’t\ndirectly involve you, but I wanted you to be there to watch.”\nNeturo led the way out onto the path that wound along the cliff face up\ntoward the old monastery. Szeth followed, curious. The monastery was\nmaintained by shamans and their acolytes, but there was no Honorbearer in\nattendance.

Theirs was the Stoneward monastery, dedicated to the lost\nHerald.\nSzeth was thus surprised when they joined a group of people standing\nwith the General near the gates into the monastery. General Kinal was a\nwide, quiet man, with darker skin and grey streaking his beard. Szeth had\nalways seen him as stoic, even dangerous, but today he was nodding\nenthusiastically to his companion—his eyes wide with excitement, looking\nlike nothing so much as a young recruit taking his first advice.\n“I’m pleased at the changes in your camp,” one of the newcomers was\nsaying. “Pleased indeed, General Kinal.”\nThe speaker was a short, older man, light skinned with a long drooping\nbeard and mustaches. Bald, wearing brilliant light blue robes, indicating a\nhigh-ranking shaman—or in this case, the highest. For he held a brilliant\nHonorblade in front of him, point down, one hand on the hilt and the tip\nsunken six inches or so into the stone of the pathway. Szeth had heard that\nthe Honorbearers often kept their swords out when visiting—as a reminder.\nA display of the trust placed in the Shin people, and the Truth they silently\nbore. The knowledge that someday the enemy would return, and someone\nwould need to be ready to fight.\nIt was his first time seeing one of the Blades—this one wide like a\nweapon meant to slay horses, with a hooked end and sweeping ridges. Szeth\nwas mesmerized. It was to the dull iron sword he’d used earlier what a\nbeautiful white pelt was to a muddy washrag.\nDo you want to hold one? the Voice asked.\n“Yes,” Szeth whispered. “Yes.”\nGood. The time is not right. Perhaps it never will be. But I am watching\nyou.\nThe General waved toward Szeth’s father. “Here he is, honor-nimi. The\none I mentioned to you!”\nThe aged Honorbearer took Neturo in, measuring him. “You are the\nsecretary who has been overseeing discipline and work routines?”\n“Yes, honor-nimi,” Neturo said.\n“I am Pozen-son-Nash, and I find myself impressed with you. The men\nof your camp are happier, yet do their work more willingly. The shamans\nreport impressive changes in morale. This has long been a difficult camp,\nwatched over by several of us, but with no Honorbearer of its own—and\nwith a Farmer who is far too kindly. Tell me, secretary, where did you learn\nthe ways of leading men and inspiring them?”\n“Well,” Neturo said, “people are a lot like sheep, honor-nimi.”\nThe Honorbearer looked shocked by that. Szeth, of course, understood.\nSheep were caring, and communal, and smart. But in large groups, you at\ntimes needed a firm hand. His father explained basically this same idea,\nthough Szeth wasn’t listening much. His eyes were on that beautiful relic.\nFighting and killing isn’t bad, Szeth thought. If it were, God wouldn’t\nhave given us swords. We’re needed. Killing, sometimes, is needed.\nIn this, he was a sheep himself. He knew that what they did was right,\nbut he would have loved a firmer hand. Direction.\nPerhaps the man in front of him would finally be someone who could"

Direction.\nPerhaps the man in front of him would finally be someone who could\ngive it. Szeth, over the last few years, felt he’d matured. He could grasp that\ndifferent people saw things differently from him. That a soup with a lot of\npepper could be right for one person, but wrong for another. Some\nquestions didn’t actually have right answers.\nBut some had to have right answers. So Szeth asked, “May I be allowed\nto speak, General-nimi, honor-nimi?”\nAll eyes turned to him, as if he were a bright splash of color on the\nwrong person. Szeth stifled a blush and tried to stand tall, as he’d been\ntrained.\n“And who is this?” the Honorbearer asked.\n“My son,” Father said, placing his hand on Szeth’s shoulder. “As good a\nson as a man could want, honor-nimi, and one full of curious questions.”\nPerhaps a soldier should not care what a father said. But Neturo’s praise\nmade Szeth swell.\n“He is one of our most promising young officers,” the General said.\n“Likely will follow his father into administration before too long.”\n“And in so doing,” the Honorbearer said, focusing on Szeth, “deny us\nyet another talented leader for the field. But I will not interfere with your\nmanagement. Young man, what is your question?”\nSzeth swallowed, and—feeling like a fool for having the same stupid\nquestion every time—forced himself to speak. “Honor-nimi, how do you\nknow what is right?”\nThe older man cocked his head, then dismissed his Blade, frowning. He\nglanced at Szeth’s father, who shrugged, as if to say, I told you he was a\ncurious type.\n“We have all been taught right and wrong since childhood,” the\nHonorbearer said. “You have, by all accounts, a wonderful father. He did\nnot explain this to you?”\nSzeth squirmed; the Honorbearer sounded almost offended by the\nquestion. Still, his father nodded encouragingly, so he continued. “Honor-\nnimi, I was taught. But as I grow, I see that truth seems … different for\ndifferent people. Is there one truth, or many? How do I know which one to\nfollow?”\n“Listen to your superiors,” the Honorbearer said. “Follow the chain of\ncommand.”\n“I trust in the General and the monasteries,” Szeth said. “But how do you\nknow what is right?”\n“Our chain of command,” the Honorbearer said, “ends at the Heralds,\nwho serve the Lifebrother—spren of soil—and the spren of mountains, sun,\nand moons. They, in turn, report to God himself. Do you question these?”\n“No, I suppose not.”\n“Then follow what you’re told, young man,” the Honorbearer said, “and\ncount yourself lucky to be one who defends Truth.”\nSzeth nodded, bowing his head.\n“Is there a particular moral question you’re having trouble with?”\nsomeone else asked.

It was one of the\nHonorbearer’s attendants, another high-ranking shaman, in violet robes. She\nhad short dark hair of a style he’d never seen before, parts of it made to\nstick out as if on purpose. It seemed a flagrant way to draw attention to\noneself.\n“We do not want to trouble you, honor-nimi,” the General said to the\nwoman, paying her deference.\n“It is no trouble,” she replied.\nHonor-nimi? A second Honorbearer?\nShe watched him, her eyes a deep shade of violet, hands clasped before\nher. She looked young for an Honorbearer, though what did he know?\n“I …” Szeth said, searching. “I have trouble hurting people, honor-nimi.\nEven in training, when it would be correct. It feels wrong.”\n“It is not so terrible,” the woman said. “I do not see this as a flaw.”\n“Nonsense,” the older Honorbearer said. “Sivi, if he is to be a soldier, he\ncannot afford to hesitate—it could mean the lives of his companions if he\ndoes.”\nShe considered. “An unfortunate truth, but this one is destined for\nadministration.”\n“Which is a problem in itself,” the older Honorbearer said. “We\nconsistently promote the ones who are levelheaded out of battle, yet we\ncomplain about ‘incident’ after ‘incident.’” He focused on Szeth. “Young\nman, what do you want to do?”\n“What is right,” Szeth said immediately.\n“Then do this.” The older man pointed at Szeth. “Each week, take at\nleast one shift at the camp slaughterhouse. Accustom yourself to death, little\nsheepherder.”\nThe idea horrified Szeth. Which … might be good?\n“General,” Pozen continued, “when the next raid happens, assign this\none to the defense.”\n“He’s a little young yet.”\n“He wants to know how to fight, doesn’t he? How to hurt? Don’t put him\nat the front, of course; let him be in the rear guard. These are lessons you\nlearn only by experience.” He met Szeth’s eyes. “Will you do it? Follow my\norders to the best of your understanding?”\n“Is it right?” Szeth asked.\n“I say that it is. Do you believe me?”\nWhat else could he say? He was glad that for once, someone seemed\nwilling to be firm.\nSo he nodded.\nAnd was sent to learn how to kill.\nI have plans to deal with Odium, as I told you before. I will not\nexplain them to you.\nWe’ll go east,” Jezrien said as Dalinar entered the dugout. “We’ll leave\nBattar in charge here.”\nDalinar hovered near the doorway. Jezrien and Ishar sat near the fire at\nthe center, which had burned low. Chana—the red-haired woman with furs\nand the strange almost sword—paced behind them, while Vedel was\nsomehow creating a strange latticework of lights between her fingers.

Like\nthe strings of a child’s game, except made of power, into which she stared.\nThat seemed an awful lot like Bondsmithing to Dalinar, and it held his\nattention while the others conversed.\n“Jez, maybe the rebels are right,” Chana said as she flopped down in the\ndirt. Not the most graceful of people. “I doubt anything is ever going to\nflourish in this place.”\n“Battar is confident,” Jezrien said. “Keep breeding the strains that do\ngrow, albeit weakly, and she says eventually we’ll turn this mud fertile.”\n“Would that we’d thought to bring soil with us,” Ishar said, shaking his\nhead.\n“Who thought we’d need dirt?” Chana said. “It’s weird so many of you\nbrought rocks.”\n“Mementos of a world lost,” Jezrien said. “Kalak. Going east. Do you\nagree?”\nThey looked to Dalinar.\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “We can’t abandon other humans to die.”\n“So even Kalak agrees,” Chana said. “Our veterans are all grizzled\nelders, but they can help us train a new generation. Maybe just … a show of\nforce, a threat to the migration grounds will be enough.”\n“Jezrien,” Dalinar said, sitting by the fire with the others, “I said\nsomething earlier that upset you and Ishar. What is going on? Are you\nplanning something without me?”\nIt was his best lead. He’d tried to talk about the idea of making Heralds,\nand these two seemed to know something. Indeed, they shared a glance.\n“We’re not ready,” Ishar said, flicking his eyes to Vedel and her lattice of\nlines of light. She nodded.\n“Your plans can take far too long, old friend,” Dalinar said to Ishar.\n“Immortality has you thinking like the stones themselves—watching the\neons, barely changing.”\n“My idea is an idea of gods, Kalak,” Ishar said. “It must move on their\ntimescale, and cannot be rushed.”\n“Surely you can give me something,” Dalinar said, thinking a note might\nbe a good anchor. “Some … bit of explanation, perhaps? Written down?”\nThey stared at him blankly.\n“What words are these?” Ishar asked.\nStorms. Dalinar had a moment of utter disconnect, realizing that they\ndidn’t have writing yet. They spoke in ways that felt so modern, and he had\nassumed too much. He should blame the bond that was translating for him.\nIt made their conversation seem so comfortable, but their gestures and some\nof their facial expressions were far more alien.\nBefore he could try to explain, the drape covering the doorway rustled,\nand someone stepped in. The Herald Shalash—looking to be seventeen or\neighteen.\nJezrien frowned. “Ash?”\n“Why am I not invited?” Shalash asked. “Why do you all plan without\nme?”\n“My beautiful,” Jezrien said, standing up. “My precious fur. We—”\n“I’m over sixty years old,” Shalash said, summoning violent angerspren\nin pools at her feet. “Why do you all always treat me like a child?”"

I want to fight,\nFather. I’m immortal like you.”\n“We’re not immortal,” Vedel said softly, collapsing her lattice of light.\n“The powers changed us, yes, but we are not eternal. You grow, Ash.\nSlowly.”\n“I’m going east with you to see my cousins.” Ash yanked the ribbon\nfrom her head and tossed it to the ground, spilling long, straight black hair\nacross her shoulders. “Sixty years as a child is enough.”\nShe stormed out of the chamber, leaving them all quietly stunned.\nThe ribbon was our previous anchor, Dalinar thought. I’ve witnessed the\nrelevant moment involving it, and Navani said …\nThis vision would begin to unravel now.\n“Listen and hear, the song of new sight,\nA story of years, and of the long fight.\nFor these eyes are not yours,\nWe measure not the years,\nWe know not our full loss,\nBut we dream nonetheless.”\nAs Thude sang, Venli settled down on a worn stone that was peeking\nfrom the sand like a miniature plateau. Others nearby paused in their\nministrations to the chasmfiends. Even several of the monstrous beasts\nnearby turned their heads toward the sound.\nAs Thude continued, Venli picked out what he meant by calling this a\n“song of new sight,” and insisting these “eyes are not yours.” His song was\nfrom the perspective of the chasmfiends. Indeed, as the stanzas progressed\n—sung to the Rhythm of the Lost, a stately and sometimes unnerving\nrhythm—she saw why.\nShe’d been told that chasmfiends could project images in one another’s\nminds—that they communicated through some sort of bond. Some were\ncapable of sharing it with singers. According to Thude’s song, they found\nboth humans and listeners to be a curious bunch of cremlings. It was hard,\nthe song explained, to recollect the past. Chasmfiends didn’t write, and their\nsongs weren’t of narrative, but emotions. They’d lived on these vast rolling\nhills for many centuries, and rarely saw singers or humans except when\nthey underwent the final change—when they visited the Shattered Plains to\ngrow manyfold and obtain the last stage of their adulthood.\nThat was all pretty vague. But the next part—the first humans who\nfought back and killed a chasmfiend—was starkly remembered by the\nbeasts. Burned into the minds of all those nearby, then passed to the other\nchasmfiends as warning.\n“Then raising a nail, made all of steel,\nA warrior brought hail, and pain to feel.\nNow our eyes saw true,\nOur ears now heard trace,\nOur ways were at fault,\nThese were rivals to fight.”\nAs the song continued, she realized she’d been expecting fear or anger\nfrom the chasmfiends. Instead, they responded to the killing as a challenge."

        "text": "Our ways were at fault,\nThese were rivals to fight.”\nAs the song continued, she realized she’d been expecting fear or anger\nfrom the chasmfiends. Instead, they responded to the killing as a challenge.\nAmong their kind, a smaller chasmfiend would often challenge a larger one\nfor dominance—but it was usually just a show. The smaller one, once\nproving itself bold and brave, would back off. They rarely killed each other.\nThese little things with the metal teeth, however—they didn’t back\ndown. They were rivals, so the chasmfiends began fighting back, as a\ndisplay of strength. The chasmfiends were animals … or maybe something\ndifferent from both common animal and listener. Either way, they kept on\nfighting, stealing prey from the humans, individually challenging humans\nand sometimes listeners for dominance. Until the day …\n“When report came in stark, by one who was bold,\nA story made dark, without reason to hold,\nIt could not be said,\nWithout rhythm so sad,\nLike a hit to the skull,\nThey were killing the small.”\nThude seemed to be taking some liberties, framing it in tones that the\nlisteners would empathize with. The meaning was plain enough: The\nchasmfiends hadn’t initially grasped that the humans were attacking the\npupating ones—because who would do that? There was no dominance to be\nestablished and no bravery to prove there. Yet they understood eventually.\nTheir numbers were dwindling because the strange creatures were doing\nsomething unthinkable. For centuries, the chasmfiends had depended on\nthis location—which they called the land of fallen stars—for their\ntransformations. While they pupated many times in their lives, the final\ntransformation had to happen at the Shattered Plains. Why was not clear to\nVenli from the song.\nThe song entered a prolonged set of stanzas eulogizing the young, which\nthe listeners had also been killing. For their survival, yes, but to the near\nextinction of a grand species. It would have been bad enough if they’d been\ndumb animals, but to find them capable of thought … well, Venli could\nunderstand the Rhythm of the Lost as a choice. And the horror with which\nThude—although no expert at composition—painted the realization.\nThe narrative continued with an unexpected turn: The chasmfiends\ndecided these little things, small though they were, must actually be\ndominant. And so, when the listeners left the Shattered Plains … a group of\nthe chasmfiends came and offered their version of a truce. This group—\nsome fifty individuals, not the majority of the remaining chasmfiends, but a\nsizable chunk—had thrown their lot in with Venli’s people.\n“The right time had come, songs became new.\nThe storm was undone, leaving fresh dew.\nWe lived with those small,\nAnd found their true skill.\nNot that of bringing ends,\nBut of scratching our ears.”\nThat brought a chuckle to those listening, though Thude sounded a little\nembarrassed by the joke ending. He had grown during this last year. Venli\ncould remember a day when all he did was talk about wanting to get\nsomething to eat—yet here he was, leading their people and creating songs.\n“So,” Venli said from her rock, “they simply … stopped trying to eat\nus?”"

Apparently, they find\nways to live with one another in situations like that.” He glanced at the\nlarge dozing heaps that appeared much less fearsome when they were\nhumming softly to the ministrations of the listeners.\n“I don’t think they see us as dominant,” Venli said, her arms folded.\n“It’s more complex than that,” Thude explained. “To them, dominance\nwas never about dominating. They want to look strong before each other,\nprobably to attract mates, partially also because it just … feels good, I\nsuppose. We showed ourselves capable of fighting, and they were the ones\nwho backed away. Now they’re content to live together.”\n“We were cowardly,” Jaxlim said. She stood with hands clasped behind\nher. “We killed their young.”\n“They give no signs of bearing a grudge, fortunately,” Thude said to\nConsolation. “They evidently like this arrangement. People to clean their\ncarapace and scratch between gaps is an excellent trade for sharing some\nfood, in their minds. They’re predators, and big ones. They need to sleep …\nwell, most of the day, really.” He changed to the Rhythm of Determination.\n“But Venli, Jaxlim, if we need a boulder lifted or a beast slain … they’re\neager to help. And they can carry dozens of us on their backs at once.”\n“Can they fight?” Venli asked.\n“I think history has proven they can,” Thude said. “But it’s also shown\nthat they’re outmatched by Shardbearers.”\n“What about Fused?” Venli said.\nThude looked at her, uncomfortable. He didn’t want to face it, but Venli\nhad to.\n“Odium is going to take notice of us eventually,” she said, laying her\narms on her knees as she sat. “Even if we don’t participate in the fighting.\nYou remember the deal between him and the humans?”\nShe had a spanreed, and had sent a few short communications to Rlain,\nas promised when they’d parted. He wasn’t responding lately, which\nworried her, but before he’d gone silent, he’d explained the details of the\ncontest to her.\n“Yes,” Thude said to Anxiety. “There might be fighting right now, but\nit’s leading to peace in a few days. That’s good for us, isn’t it?”\n“It seems that the enemy,” she said, “will have plenty of time to focus on\nsmall details he’s ignored. People he thought he’d destroyed completely, but\nwho persist—their continued existence making a liar of him.”\n“Gods,” Jaxlim said softly, “do not like being embarrassed.”\n“We could join the humans,” Venli said idly.

It was—\nIt was …\nProbably what she deserved. She took a long calming breath, letting\nTimbre’s rhythms help her find a way to Peace. One would think that by\nnow she would have purged herself of being selfish. It was still there,\nhowever: that drive to demand respect. The part of her that wanted power\nand praise.\nTimbre pulsed, indicating it was a normal emotion. But Venli thought\nshe felt it more strongly than others. Why was that? Was she genuinely a\nworse person than the rest of them?\nTimbre replied that there were different challenges for different people.\nBeing self-aware was part of the solution. Venli returned her thanks, but\nprivately she was even a little annoyed by Timbre—who always had the\nright answers. Still, she’d decided not to indulge in self-pity. She’d have to\nremain vigilant, and work harder to reject her natural inclinations toward\npride. She instead attuned Joy, reminding herself how wonderful these last\nthree days had been.\n“Venli,” her mother said, walking over, “are you well?”\n“Just frustrated and confused.”\nJaxlim settled down on the stone beside Venli, then wrapped her arms\naround her, humming softly to Love. Venli wasn’t a child anymore, and felt\nashamed at first. But then … then Timbre picked up the rhythm too, and it\nvibrated through Venli. Being held wasn’t solely for little children. It was\nfor all children. She closed her eyes and at first suffered it, then accepted it,\nthen …\nThen savored it. She breathed out, and allowed herself to attune Love as\nwell.

But within that embrace, all she\nwanted was to be the daughter her mother expected. The daughter who\nknew the heritage of her people, and carried with her their songs. She’d\nneed to hear Thude’s new one again, and memorize it.\nAnd yet, the oddities, Venli thought. There are serious holes in that story.\n“Why?”\n“Why what?” Jaxlim asked, still holding her.\n“Chasmfiends need to come to the Shattered Plains for their ultimate\ntransformation. Why? The highstorms give them the power to grow. So\ncan’t they make that transformation anywhere?”\n“Many animals have such instincts.”\n“We just learned they’re more than animals, Mother,” Venli said. “They\napparently tried the final pupation elsewhere.”\n“That might only be the song,” Jaxlim said. “Thude said he’s not expert\nin them.”\nVenli let the hug persist a little longer, but found she couldn’t leave the\nquestions alone. She rose and strode to one of the chasmfiends—a large\none, with dark eyes full of mystery. It snorted at her as she stepped in front\nof it, her every instinct indicating she should run.\nInstead, she stared it in the eyes. “Why?” she said. “Why do you need to\npupate on the Shattered Plains?”\nThe beast settled its head back down, closing its eyes and turning away\nfrom her. She stepped in front of it again, right up near the eye.\n“I can be extremely stubborn,” she whispered. “It’s practically my\ndefining trait. So I’m going to get an answer.”\nThe thing snorted again, then opened one eye.\nIn a second, she felt what it had, climbing onto a plateau years ago.\nNeeding to grow, bursting against its own carapace. It followed a song. A\nthousand powerful songs, sung by fragments of light in the ground. There,\nwithin its cocoon …\nPower. Flooding it. Expanding it. Power coming from the sky and from\nthe ground.\nVenli gasped, and searched her memory for the songs she’d been taught\nto repeat so many times. About how her people had found their way to the\nShattered Plains. It seemed they’d been led there. But by what?\nBy songs, the stones whispered.\n“There is something here, isn’t there?” she whispered. “Why has\neveryone fought so hard over this barren, broken expanse?”\n“Venli?” her mother asked, stepping up to her. “It’s because of the\nOathgate and the Shardblades abandoned here.”\n“Yes,” Venli said, feeling the chasmfiend’s memory. “But what … what\nif there’s more?”\nWhy had a kingdom ever been built in this desolate place, where the\nstorms were so devastating?\nWhat had broken the Plains?\nWhat had she felt from the chasmfiend as it transformed?\nFinally, why did Odium want this place so badly?

A highstorm was near.\nNavani watched as Dalinar vanished into the hut dug in the hillside, a hole\nin the top letting smoke from the fire within trail out, like a kettle’s spout\nfor steam.\n“Gram?” Gav asked, seated nearby. “I’m scared.”\nNavani knelt by the boy and hugged him. “Don’t be frightened, Gav.\nWe’re here with you now.”\n“Is this really a place of pretend?”\n“Yes,” Navani said. “You know how you and Grandpa play greatshell,\nwhere he’s the beast, and you’re the mighty knight who slays it?”\nGav nodded.\n“Well, this is a place where everything—even the ground and the sky—\npretends with us. We came here to learn secrets.”\n“Secrets that … the ground and the sky know?”\n“Well, maybe.” Navani thought a moment. “Wind, can you hear me?”\n“Gram?” Gav asked. “Is this part of the pretending?”\n“Yes, Gav. It is. Wind, you spoke to us earlier,” Navani said, staring at\nthe sky. “Please. Can you see me here, now?”\nI see you, a quiet voice said. Woman of another time. This was my time.\nMy era. This was when I lived …\n“Did you die, then?”\nSpren don’t die, they only change forms. We bend to how people see us,\nand so I am no longer a god. You worship the storm instead.\n“Gram?” Gav said. “What is that voice?”\n“It’s …” Navani hesitated. “It’s the Wind, Gav.”\n“Will it hurt me?”\n“No,” Navani whispered. “Remember what I showed you in the tower?\nSome spren are good. Some spren help us.”\n“I …” Gav grew thoughtful, after his way. “I remember. I heard …\nsomething earlier, before Grampa found me. A nice spren, that said it could\nprotect me from the bad ones. It sounded like Daddy.”\n“Good!” Navani said, but she doubted Gav knew his father’s voice. He\nhad been so young when Elhokar left for the Shattered Plains.\nChild, the Wind said to Gav, I will not hurt you. I am not the storm,\nthough I am in the storm.\n“Wind,” Navani said, still hugging Gav, “is … what my husband wishes\nto do … is it valid?”\nValid? Or possible?\n“Either?” she said.\nBoth, but there are burdens to be borne. Secrets even I do not know,\nbecause I was voiceless and quiet—confined mostly to Shinovar. If the\nBondsmith wishes to become Honor, it will hurt.\n“Would it … help him with his fight?”\n“Grampa is a good fighter,” Gav whispered. He closed his eyes. “I want\nto be a good fighter. Like him. Like Daddy. I want to be a king.”\nIt might help, the Wind said. I prepare in case it does not. To protect my\ncharges.\n“Your charges?” Navani asked."

Blessed by the\nstorm. A champion for the wind itself …\nNavani considered that, but was distracted as she saw the distant\nmountains begin to fade. The vision was ending.\nDalinar started picking up random objects in the dugout, frantic, since\nNavani said she’d felt something at touching the ribbon. He even grabbed\nthe ribbon, hoping maybe it would work again. He felt nothing.\nBut as he worked, the others occasionally giving him odd glances, a\nword cut through his panic.\n“Nale gave me a mark of debt.”\nJezrien had said it, but Dalinar spun, realizing something. All of the\nHeralds had been accounted for in this vision except Taln and Nale. Two\nwho seemed Makabaki. And this group were discussing going to help\n“Makibak.”\n“Nale,” Dalinar said, kneeling by the others. “He will be there?”\n“Probably,” Chana said, lounging back. “I don’t like that one. He might\navoid us.”\n“No,” Jezrien said. “He will help. Nale is one of the most honorable men\nI’ve ever known.”\n“He was our enemy!” Chana said.\n“And we were wrong,” Vedel whispered. “He knew the truth of the god\nPassion long before any of us did. We fought on the wrong side of that war,\nChana. I feel I will spend my life regretting that choice.”\n“Nale,” Dalinar said, “gave you … something?”\nDalinar heard a rumbling in the back of his mind. The Stormfather was\nwatching, quietly.\n“Yes,” Jezrien said, reaching to his pouch. He took out a small piece of\nstone, marked with scratches in the shape of an animal head. A picture that\nwas reminiscent of a glyph. Maybe they did have writing—or some early\nancestor of it.\n“He … owes you a new ox?” Chana said, frowning.\n“No, this represents a larger debt,” Jezrien said. “An ox debt was all we\nhad to signify the moment. The Makibaki have been using them to mark all\nkinds of things.”\nDalinar stared at the disc. It would work. A connection from this moment\nto Nale, and a debt he owed Jezrien.\nDalinar. The Stormfather’s voice. Please. Don’t take this step. I …\nPlease. It might …\n“It might what?” Dalinar whispered.\nIt might reveal … me …\nDalinar hesitated. He felt an empathy for the Stormfather, as Dalinar\nknew the pain that history remembered could reveal. But this was the only\npath.\n“I’m sorry, Stormfather,” Dalinar said, with genuine regret.\nJezrien was still watching the disc. “Nale gave me this with a promise. If\nI show him this, he’ll listen to—”\nDalinar snatched it. He immediately felt it pulsing with a deep sense of\nmeaning—a Connection. He leapt to his feet, and Chana—moving quickly\n—lunged to tackle him. But Dalinar realized he’d been ready for this. An"

An\nold instinct that had led him to identify the one in the room most likely to\nattack him.\nHe dodged her, then burst out of the hovel. The vision was breaking\napart, buildings unraveling as if to smoke, but he found Navani desperately\ntrying to find an anchor near the firepits. He charged up and hooked his\nright arm around her. Gav began to cry as the vision unraveled, but Dalinar\nseized the boy with his left hand and held on tightly. All the while keeping\nhold of that little stone disc in his right fist.\nIn the chaotic darkness that followed, it formed an anchor to the next\npoint in their journey.\nEIGHTEEN YEARS AGO\nSzeth ducked into the building, a simple one-room home in the fishing\nvillage. Dirt floor. An unmended net hanging on a peg from the wall. Bone\nhooks leaning against the door, for reaching into the deep and pulling up\ncages. The place smelled of brine and old shells.\nFive men huddled on the floor, wearing the clothing of fishermen. Dirty,\ntheir eyes downcast. The stonewalkers had begun taking slaves. Today they\nwould get what they came for. And more.\n“All is well?” Szeth hissed to the men.\nOne of his sergeants nodded. “We’re ready, sir.”\nThe men on this mission were his best: a brave group willing to forgo\nexercise for a time to enhance their scrawny appearance. He checked on\neach one, making absolutely certain each was committed. Then he hurried\nto the goods by the wall: oil from the bladders of the giant crabs that walked\nthe ocean floor, stored in leather sacks. Prized shells in wooden boxes.\nThe stonewalkers’ loot, and their doom. Each box had a false bottom\nwith weapons stored inside. Hand on his sword, Szeth urged the men to\nbravery and moved toward the next building. In the distance, the\nstonewalker raiders’ ships were barely visible. Szeth hesitated, looking out\nacross the evening waters—which were placid, as if subservient to the\ninvaders.\nYou have time, the Voice said. If you hurry.\nSzeth crept into the next building. At nineteen, he’d been living as a\nsoldier for eight years now. He sometimes found it difficult to remember\npastoral life as a shepherd—but going out among the common folk brought\nreminders. As he checked on the soldiers in this building, he passed a large\ncrab shell on the wall—painted with colors. The fisherfolk here added; they\nwould capture fish, but nothing larger. They would have harvested that shell\nfrom a crab that died naturally. Even the oil could be harvested humanely.\nOnce, he had believed adding was the sole way to live. Now he had\nfound another. He spoke to each man, then hastened outside.\nThis is a good plan, Szeth, the Voice said as he entered the final building\nin the row. I’m proud of you.\n“The General wouldn’t go this far,” he whispered.\nAre you following orders?\n“To the letter,” Szeth said.\nThen how could he complain?"

        "text": "in the row. I’m proud of you.\n“The General wouldn’t go this far,” he whispered.\nAre you following orders?\n“To the letter,” Szeth said.\nThen how could he complain?\nThese last years, he’d cherished what the Honorbearer had told him. Do\nas he was told. Except … there was so much wiggle room. His orders were\nto protect the villages. The General would want a display of force to scare\nthe raiders away—but if Szeth did that, the raiders would just find another\nundefended village to assault. It had happened before.\nThough it hadn’t seemed so at first, what the Honorbearer had said—to\nfollow orders to the best of his understanding—put the burden back on\nSzeth. Lately they’d told him to show initiative—to be a leader. These\nwords had to mean something. He would show the General that he could do\nmore than follow orders; he could excel at them.\nEvery one of his soldiers was in place, eyes downcast, dirt on their faces.\nReady for the trap.\nThe General doesn’t have answers, the Voice said. Only you have\nanswers. The ones you find, the ones you create for yourself. This is good.\nYou are good.\nSzeth nodded, crouching inside the doorway and lifting the beads that\ndraped the opening to peek at the approaching ships, which stalked like\nwild axehounds on the hunt—shadows moving across the water. Five years\nsince that day the Honorbearers had visited. Five years of visiting the\nslaughterhouse each week. Five years of being sent on patrols. He now fully\nunderstood the weaknesses of those who added. The Farmer, for all his\ncareful wisdom, was afraid of the outsiders. His orders to the General were\ntoo passive.\nBoth worried about antagonizing the stonewalkers, so it had grown\nworse over the years. More raids. More thefts. Now the opportunistic taking\nof slaves. The Farmer had begun leaving goods as a kind of tribute, hoping\nthat a larger offering would keep the enemy from taking slaves.\nThat wouldn’t work. The Voice promised it would merely get worse.\nSzeth had been told to show initiative, and he thought he could hear the\nwords they weren’t saying. They wanted someone to solve this problem for\nthem.\nSzeth narrowed his eyes. He knew that feeling.\nToday, the spren said, they learn.\nSzeth slipped out of the building. He paused by the water to fish a stone\nout of the surf. For luck. Sand was fine for fisherfolk to walk on because of\nits size, though they used docks to avoid little stones. He liked to carry them\nfor a bit, then deliver them to the grove near the camp.\nLucky stone secured, he moved around the building and selected a\nhiding spot behind it. He felt at his belt for the horn—slick, cold, ready to\nsummon his reserves from the nearby valley. It would be his job to call off\nthe trap if he thought anything was amiss. So Szeth watched—anxious—as\nthe ships stilled in the bay. They released smaller boats, like a swarm of\ngnats, which glided ever closer, moved by oars through the mirror waters.\nAlmost here …\nA sound to his right.\nSzeth spun, and to his horror he spotted a young boy—wearing a splash"

What?\nThe people had been evacuated on the Farmer’s orders! But before Szeth\ncould move to usher the child away, he heard guttural outlander shouts. The\nsplashing of men leaping from boats, which ground against the sand as they\nwere pulled ashore.\nThe boy panicked and crouched by a building. Idiot. What had tempted\nhim into danger?\nWhat tempted you that day, Szeth? the Voice asked. Perhaps this boy left\nbehind something he loved.\nSzeth watched with an increased tension as the stonewalkers raided the\nvillage. Ripping down bead doorways, laughing to one another as they\nfound offerings. This time not just goods, but some weak, scraggly slaves.\nMen taught to speak one phrase in the stonewalker language: “We are yours\nnow.”\n“Please, spren of the moons,” Szeth whispered. “Don’t let them be\nsuspicious. Don’t let them question.”\nIt will be as I desire, the Voice said to the prayer.\nThe foreigners began forcing slaves onto their boats, sacks of oil slung\nover shoulders, boxes of shells carried triumphantly. Not for the first time\nSzeth wondered, were there people who added among the outsiders? Did\nthese soldiers really have no Farmer to control them?\nMen who would subtract with no oversight whatsoever from calmer\nminds. The idea disturbed him.\nSzeth refused to let himself relax, even though the enemy took the bait—\nlaughing and joking in their twisted language. One lit a torch, ready to\nthrow it onto the buildings. Another of the stonewalkers slapped him,\nshouting something, then tossed the torch into the nearby surf with a hiss.\n“What are they saying?” Szeth asked, wishing he had the training in\nlanguages that was common to the shamans.\nWith so much oil around, the leader fears that a fire could rage out of\ncontrol.\nPity. Szeth had thought they were showing mercy to the village. He\nturned to look through the darkness toward the boy, who had smartly\nremained quiet. Obviously terrified, huddling by the wall, shadowed from\nthe pale blue light of the Second Sister above.\nSzeth needed these soldiers to retreat with their bounty, so he could\nmove on to the next stage of the plan. Unfortunately, as some of them\nstarted to row out to sea, the leader barked something to his men, who\nbegan to scout the area. What could they possibly be looking for? The\nvillage homes were all arrayed facing the coast; only some sheds and small\npastures lay back here.\nApparently they wanted to squeeze every bit of value from this raid. A\nfew grabbed chickens from a coop, and another kicked open a shed. There\nwere no hinges, so the boards were fitted to slide into place. Loathing the\nmen for their greed, Szeth faded further into the darkness of his hiding\nplace. Until he saw men heading toward the boy’s location.

They’d push\ninto that shack, and with the way the boy was whimpering …\nYou know what you need to do, the Voice said to him.\nSzeth stood up from his hiding place.\nI meant you needed to remain in hiding, Szeth, and let the boy suffer the\nconsequences of his actions. The Voice sounded annoyed. But how could it\nbe angry if it wouldn’t explain what it wanted?\nSzeth walked into the middle of the roadway, causing the foreigners to\nshout. The ones nearest the boy pulled out weapons and pointed them at\nSzeth, who—feigning fear—cringed away. He tossed them his sword, then\nwent to his knees.\nThis is a dangerous gamble, the Voice said.\n“They took the others as slaves without question.”\nUnarmed men weakened over time. They might be afraid of you. They\nshould be afraid of you.\nThey weren’t. They were accustomed to weakness from Szeth’s people,\neven the soldiers. These laughed, one taking his sword, then saying\nsomething that—despite the language barrier—Szeth could tell was\nderisive. Outsiders did not think highly of Shin metallurgy.\nThey took Szeth, removed his armor, and tied him up. Then all the men\nwho had been searching this back street hauled him off toward one of the\nlanding boats, leaving the boy hidden.\nThe stonewalkers smelled awful, of oil and sweat. They wore furs for\nwarmth while sailing, but their clothing underneath was … well, ordinary.\nColorful, in fact. Tunics with leather breastplates and knee guards. Metal\nhelmets.\nMany had narrow black beards bound in cords, and they handled him\nroughly as they forced him to sit in the little boat. They rowed him out\nacross the still waters toward the nearest of the three ships. They’d left him\nhis horn, but he didn’t seek to blow it. The plan—his own problems\nnotwithstanding—was going fine. Hopefully none of his watching reserves\nwould strike out early in some foolish attempt to rescue him. Hopefully he\nhadn’t ruined the entire operation to protect one silly boy.\nBut if it’s not to protect silly boys, Szeth thought to himself, then why am\nI here?\nAt the ship, they raised his boat up on winches, then hauled him out onto\nthe deck—where a man wearing fine clothing, including a long coat, looked\nhim over. Likely the captain. Szeth spotted some of his soldiers being\nushered belowdecks, as escaped slaves from past raids had indicated. Loot\n—people and goods alike—was split equally among the ships, and stowed\nin their dark bowels. But each of Szeth’s men had a small blade hidden in\ntheir mouth to cut their bonds.\nThe captain seized Szeth’s horn and had others search his pockets, where\nthey found the lucky stone he’d grabbed earlier. They found this particularly\nexciting, and for a moment Szeth was confused.\nThey think it’s an Oathstone, the Voice explained.

These were allowed to take an oath on a\nsacred stone, then do service. They were rare enough he’d never met one.\n“One that small could be an Oathstone?” he asked.\nMost are smaller, the Voice said. It is a curious practice among your\npeople, one I have encouraged. I approve of oaths. Unbreakable, binding\nyour will to the people you serve.\nThe leader of the raiders barked orders at Szeth. In response, Szeth\nsagged in the men’s grip, trying to get his feet underneath him as the ship\nswayed. The other landing boats had all been unloaded.\nDistant horns sounded from the reserves. The sign. Excellent. People on\nthe ship scanned the coast. The captain merely laughed—they had the loot.\nHe called out to his men, and they started preparing the ship to sail.\nThe captain is amused, the Voice said. He finds leaving slaves and\nofferings to be a sign of cowardice, and believes the arriving forces are just\nmaking a show of doing something now that the danger has passed. Like a\ndog raving at the fence once the stranger has already turned away. He\nbelieves raiding here each season will make him extremely rich.\nSzeth nodded, his nervousness rising as he waited, hoping. Now was the\nmoment. This was when …\nOne of the three ships leaked smoke. Screams followed, then flames\nbroke through windows, and smoke billowed from the hold, turning the ship\ninto a black column in moments—only a phantom orange light below\nmarking the flames within. Szeth held a breath until he saw unarmored Shin\nmen diving from the ship in the chaos.\nHis soldiers had executed the plan. Cutting themselves free, killing any\nwatching, then spreading and burning the oil. That done, they could escape\ninto the night. Moments later, shouts sounded from the hold of the ship he\nwas on, and he smelled smoke. In seconds it began to seep, thick and black,\nbetween the boards under his feet.\nThe men on deck panicked, ripping themselves away from the horrific\nsight of their sister vessel going up in flames as they realized they were\nnext.\nPerfect. Szeth yanked free from his stunned captors and rolled on the\ndeck. He bodychecked a sailor, then clomped down the steps to the hold,\ncoming up behind a sailor fighting against someone below. He slammed a\nkick into the sailor’s back, throwing them forward on the sword of Lumo-\nson-Tumo.\n“Stones Unhallowed!” Lumo said, light from the growing fire below\nshowing a confused Shin face. “Sir, what are you doing on board?”\n“Simply keeping an eye on things,” Szeth said, turning around. “Little\nhelp?”\nLumo sliced through the ropes binding him, then Szeth took the saber\nfrom the fallen man. Curved. He wasn’t used to that. He nodded to the\nmembers of the strike team, then together they burst up out of the hold onto\nthe deck—to find it practically empty. The sailors had jumped overboard,\nincluding the captain. They had likely realized the vessel was irrecoverable.\n“Join the reserves as they watch the beach,” Szeth said to the four. “If"

They had likely realized the vessel was irrecoverable.\n“Join the reserves as they watch the beach,” Szeth said to the four. “If\nany sailors slip past and make their way inland, they could slaughter\ndozens.”\n“Yes, sir!” the strike team said, four diving overboard as more and more\nsmoke blackened the air.\nLumo hesitated by the rail. “Sir?”\nSzeth was watching that third ship. Stonewalker sailors were swimming\nthat direction. There was no smoke.\n“Sir!” Lumo said, coughing. “You can’t stay here!”\n“Go!” Szeth said, feeling the heat flare up as flames licked through the\nhatch in the deck. Lumo refused to go, sticking by his side. Strange, how\nout here—among these men—the very attitudes that had once brought\nSzeth derision now brought him loyalty. He had not changed. He was quiet,\nnot wanting to talk when everyone else was so full of words. He still\nsparred relentlessly, and made no excuses for his resulting skill.\nThese men loved him for it. It seemed he had found three different\nmilitaries in his life. One represented in the corrupt soldier he’d killed.\nAnother represented in those of the camp, who enjoyed their easy lives. The\nfinal one was out here, among those assigned to defend their shores.\nThe third group didn’t care if he was brusque, if he beat them at\nswordplay, or if he chided them. Not as long as he could fight. Because a\nman who kept his companions alive earned the respect of all.\nFive of the men who respected him were on that last ship. Szeth turned\nand fought through the smoke, Lumo coughing as he followed. Szeth\nfetched the coat from the corpse in the stairwell, then pulled Lumo out of\nthe smoke, where both gasped for breath.\n“Swim to shore,” he said to Lumo. “I need to go for Jathen and the\nothers. If I do not return, tell Cade he has command.”\n“Yes …” Lumo said between coughs. “Yes, sir.”\nSzeth shoved him off the side of the ship, then ran across the deck—\nthrowing on the coat—to leap off the other side. He hit the water, cool and\nrefreshing, though salt stung his eyes and filled his mouth. It was better than\nthe smoke.\nHe’d only learned to swim after joining the military—yet as with all his\nlessons, he’d practiced eagerly. But it was difficult while wearing a coat and\ntrying to carry a sword in one hand. Even in a peaceful sea, he felt like he\nfought for every inch. Surging beneath the water, hearing popping and\nknocking upon the waves, he joined the stonewalkers swimming for the last\nremaining ship, hoping that his coat and the dark night would help him pass\nas one of them.\nHe swam, blackness above, a dark watery void beneath, full of phantom\nsounds.

Conveniently, the sides of this ship had many wooden\nshelves and ornaments. He clawed his way up until he heaved himself over\nthe rail.\nThe air smelled weakly of smoke from the nearby burning vessels—but\nthis ship was not aflame. Instead his five soldiers sat at the center of the\ndeck, tied to the mast with their heads bowed. By the light of shining white\nlanterns—profane, as gemstones belonged in monasteries—he could see\nblood on the deck. At least one of his men had a broken nose. Yet they\nstirred, groaning. He was in time.\nUnfortunately, some twenty stonewalker raiders were here, helping\nothers up from the water below.\nWhat will you do? the Voice said to Szeth. I am curious at your brave\nchoice. Are you not afraid?\nFear. Szeth never seemed to feel that emotion as acutely as others did.\nThere was always too much going on, too much to worry about, to be\nafraid. Still, he was nervous as he crossed the deck, pulling out the stolen\nsword. He kept his head bowed, and staggered as if exhausted from his\nswim.\nThat was a mistake. One of the others on the deck turned to help him,\nand immediately recognized what he was. Szeth had lighter skin than any of\nthese raiders—the swim had taken the soot from him, and the deck was far\ntoo well lit. Szeth raised his sword threateningly, but who would be\nintimidated by one man? Several of them grabbed their swords and came\nfor him.\nThere was no wind, but Szeth danced anyway.\nAlways before, he’d held back. Sparring or engaging in quick clashes\nwith foes had never given him a chance to truly become what he’d trained\nfor. Among his own men, he was virtually untouchable. The enemy raiders\nproved to be of lesser skill. Limbs dropped. Men screamed. Blood mixed\nwith water on the deck, lit by the too-regular glow of gemstone lanterns.\nSzeth became death for the first time. Before, he’d borrowed that\ndarkness. Today he embraced it. Three … four … seven men he dropped.\nUnstoppable.\nUntil he felt a faint tap on his back, near his left side. He thought he’d\nstumbled into something, and glanced down to see a sword tip jutting from\nhis stomach. Pain blossomed then, and the sword was yanked free. Szeth\nstumbled to the deck, stunned, and watched blood and something darker\nand fouler surge from his wound and across his hand.\nA part of his mind refused to believe. His enemies could have finished\nhim off easily as he knelt there, touching his own viscera, numbed by the\nincongruous experience.\nDo you know why there are so few true swordmasters, Szeth? the Voice\nasked.\nSzeth looked up across the ship’s deck, and a piece of him noticed that\nthe stonewalkers were still frightened of him. He’d left eight twitching\nbodies on the wood in his brief, explosive attack. The man who had struck\nhim was wounded too, and had lurched away, calling to friends as he held a"

The man who had struck\nhim was wounded too, and had lurched away, calling to friends as he held a\ndark spot on his thigh.\nIt’s because the consequences of mistakes are so high, the Voice said,\nconversationally. Even the best fighters must face battles where whims of\nfate can leave them dead in a moment. In true battle, men don’t get a\nchance to learn from mistakes.\nSzeth slumped to the deck, and the sounds of yells, of waves on the hull,\nof his own groans … softened. Dulled. Could sounds go out of focus?\nYou show promise, the Voice said. Would you like another chance, Szeth?\n“Yes,” he whispered. “Please.”\nThe lantern nearest him went out. A moment later, Szeth’s strength\nreturned. He pressed his hand to the wound, and found it sealed.\nThis once, the Voice said, I restore you. Not many men have a chance to\nlive a second time. You did not earn this. I gave it to you. Remember that.\nSzeth hauled himself to his feet.\nAlso, learn from the mistake. What did you do wrong?\nSzeth gripped his sword, but already several on deck had noticed him.\nThey were calling to their friends. He could become death again, or …\nHe turned and cut Jathen and his brother free from the nearby mast. He\nkicked a sword their way from one of the fallen, shouting, “Free the\nothers!”\nHopefully they hadn’t been beaten too badly. They did start moving at\nhis command, but Szeth’s attention had to be on the enemies. He once more\nfought with all he had. This time though, before he could be surrounded, his\nmen started backing him up. Four had gotten to their feet and were fighting.\nIn seconds, a stunning event occurred: the enemy began throwing down\ntheir swords and asking for mercy. Szeth stood, confused, gazing around the\ndeck full of exhausted, wounded, waterlogged enemy raiders.\n“It’s true,” Szeth whispered. “These never were their best, were they?”\nYou’d be hard-pressed to find truly capable soldiers among the people of\nSteen nowadays. Travel to Azir, and you’ll encounter another thing entirely.\nSzeth knew neither of those places, but he ordered his men to gather the\nsurrendered weapons. Then he pointed for the raiders to drag their wounded\nto one side of the ship, where he allowed them to tend to the fallen. What\nnext though? His goal had been to destroy all three of these ships, not\ncapture an entire crew.\n“How is Athszen?” Szeth asked as Jathen stepped up to him.\n“Dazed from his beating,” the other soldier said, “but I think he’ll\nrecover. Sir … thank you for coming for us. Truly.”\nSzeth nodded.\n“What … do we do now?” Jathen asked.\n“Get one of those shore boats ready for the six of us,” Szeth said, still\nholding a sword on the captives. “Take those bows in that rack by the side\nthere, then help Athszen and the others onto the boat.”\nJathen set to work. Szeth’s men had some rowing practice, as part of\ntheir training.\n“What do I do with them?” he whispered to the Voice."

Revenge?\n“A little,” Szeth said. “More, I want them to stop raiding. To go away,\nand never return.”\nBest way to accomplish that is to leave them frightened of you. That\nmeans letting this ship go. It’s dangerous though, because you have an\nequal chance of inspiring rage in them. A cycle of vengeance. They may\nreturn with six ships next time.\n“How do I stop that?”\nHow far are you willing to go?\nHe thought of years spent in the slaughterhouse. “Assume,” Szeth said,\n“I am willing to do whatever it takes.”\nGood. Yes, you were worth the second chance, Szeth. That one who\nstabbed you? That’s their captain. Show him the healed wound and repeat\nthe words I tell you.\nSzeth stepped up before the man and pulled back the cut and bloody\nsection of his shirt, revealing the healed skin. The Voice said words in\nSzeth’s mind that he didn’t understand, but he repeated the sounds as best\nhe could.\nThe captain and those around him pulled back, horrified.\n“What did I say?” Szeth asked.\nYou said that you were of the Stormriders. That you’d heard of the raids\non this land, and had finally brought your immortals to stop them.\n“I don’t know what the Stormriders are.”\nLegends among them, the Voice said. From a long time ago, when your\npeople left their lands and walked stones. Back when the Shin were\nfearsome warriors.\n“Hard to believe that was the case,” Szeth admitted.\nIt’s possible for any people. Humans are humans, whatever their\nhomeland. Most of the regions on this continent have been known for their\nskill in battle at one point or another. These days it might be the Alethi or\nthe Vedens, but it was once you.\nHe found that curious.\nNow, the Voice said, pick one of them and stab them right where you\nwere stabbed.\nSzeth hesitated. That would be a … hard way for a man to die. Long,\npainful.\nYou said you’d do anything.\n“Why that?” Szeth asked.\nTo make them race home, hoping to get the person to medical care. It\nwon’t work. If I hadn’t killed the foreign bacteria in your gut, you’d have\ndied.\nSzeth didn’t know the word “bacteria,” but he understood the meaning\nanyway. He dithered, but then heard the sounds of the slaughterhouse, and\nhe knew what he was. Better these than his own people. He stabbed not one,\nbut two of the sailors, to be certain the message was delivered.\nBefore the others could rise up and attack, believing they would be\nexecuted, Szeth stepped back and repeated the words the Voice gave him. A\nwarning to these men never to return, and a charge for them to spread the\nword. Shin shores were no longer easy targets.\nFor every ship that came, he would increase the number of raiders he\nchose to die slowly, painfully.\nSaying the words left him feeling … dull.

Like his emotions had suffered\nthe same muffling distortion that sounds had taken on earlier. He joined his\nmen in the little boat. Jathen had figured out the lowering mechanism.\nAs they rowed to shore, and no arrows fell, Szeth saw the captain\nstanding on deck and watching.\n“Can you speak to his mind?” Szeth whispered to the Voice.\nI cannot, as I am bonded only to those of your land.\n“Pity,” Szeth said. “I would have wished for you to tell him that I’m\nwatching him. A voice in his mind would drive that fear deep.”\nPerhaps there is something I can do. I will see.\nA short time later, Szeth rejoined his celebrating soldiers on the beach—\ntheir casualties nonexistent save a wound or two, their enemies defeated. He\ndid not celebrate with them, nor with the fishermen who came with cheers,\nbringing beer and food for their protectors. His men didn’t mind as he\nwalked away. They knew he did not participate in such events.\nInstead Szeth stood on the beach, watching two ships burn away into the\ndeep. He stood there until, as expected, a group of riders came down from\nthe monastery. He hadn’t, however, anticipated his father being among\nthem. Neturo ran up and looked at the blood on Szeth’s clothing, then\nembraced him.\n“Szeth,” Neturo said, though the warmth of the embrace felt distant to\nSzeth, “what have you done?”\nWas that … horror in his father’s voice? Szeth pulled back, trying to read\nthe emotions in the older man. “I protected our shores,” Szeth said. “I did\nwhat I was commanded to do.”\n“You went too far!” the General called from behind. “Burning their\nships? They’ll come back with hundreds more!”\n“I saw to it that they won’t, sir,” Szeth said, frustration building inside\nhim.\n“You shouldn’t have made this decision.”\n“But I followed the chain of command,” Szeth said, growing even more\nangry. “I was told to protect the shores. That was your order. You told me to\npatrol, and to find a strategy. That’s what I did! I did exactly as I was told.”\n“You took too much upon yourself, son,” Neturo said.\n“Stones! How am I to know that?” Szeth said, exasperated.\nNeturo glanced back at the General, lit by a flickering lantern. Out in the\nbay, the last of the lights went out as the burning ships finally slipped\nbeneath the surf. Leaving moonlight to reflect on the glassy water, again\ndominant, fire only a memory.\n“Szeth, report to camp,” the General said. “I will … need to seek the\nwisdom of greater minds than mine as I decide what to do with you.”\nI am well aware that if you were to know of my plans, you would\nbe compelled to interfere. It is your way, is it not?\nAdolin moved among the soldiers during their midday meal, visiting each\nsmaller subcamp in turn. He’d never had a mind for numbers or words.

        "text": "smaller subcamp in turn. He’d never had a mind for numbers or words. He\noften felt stupid when women conversed—or even, strangely, when Shallan\nand Kaladin did. He followed what they said, but missed the implications.\nBut there was one thing he had a mind for, and that was names. People\ntalked about being bad with names; he’d heard it a dozen times over. He’d\nbeen bad at them once. But in his experience, being bad with names was\nlike being bad with swords. Most people could learn if they tried hard\nenough.\nA name meant something. Adolin had learned that when he clasped\nhands with a spearman and remembered his name, and saw a certain\nbrightness ignited in the man’s eyes. Dark or light. Learning names carried\na price, because Adolin knew the faces of the fallen. It was a price he’d pay\nagain and again, because if you were going to die for someone, you could at\nleast do it for someone who knew who you were.\nThe men at his current stop drew laughterspren—like silver arrows that\ndarted in circles—as he told a story of the time he’d arrived at a dance and\nfound his trousers were on backward. He listened to their worries and\ncomplaints, and promised to do something about stubborn quartermasters\nand bland Soulcast food. He asked after families, loved ones, passions, and\ndid his storming best to remember it all.\nBecause Adolin Kholin was bad at a whole terrible host of things. But he\nrefused to let people be one of those.\nHe moved on, and heard the same story at each camp. It was barely their\nthird day of the campaign, and already it was wearing everyone down. Most\nwars weren’t constant fighting, just occasional skirmishes or all-out clashes.\nThis was different. This was a grueling, constant struggle—where you had\nto be alert as battle could come at any time. That took a toll.\nIt was relatively easy to get men riled up and energized if there was only\none decisive battle to win. It was possible to keep them excited for a series\nof skirmishes, like on the Shattered Plains, where there was glory to be won\nand a good support structure at the warcamp. This extended—but\naggressive—siege was different. Small numbers of defenders meant\nfrequent rotations into the dome. It meant holding back an enemy, instead\nof conquering plateaus or taking ground. On the very best of days they were\nstagnant—and still returned to the camps a little less numerous.\nSo Adolin countered it in the best way he knew: With stories of flipped-\naround trousers and times when he was inspired by other soldiers.\nReminders of victories they’d won. And by calling as many as he could\nremember by name. It wasn’t the way his father would have done it. Dalinar\nwould speak of kingdom, king, and ideals—not play the charismatic\ncommander. He’d tell the soldiers to fight for something, not someone.\nBecause if the someone fell, Adolin’s way could lead to chaos, while a\nnation or ideal could outlast any one man’s death.\nIt was good, reasonable leadership advice. It ignored the fact that none of\nthese soldiers really fought for their country or their ideals. Not in the\nmoment. It might have been why they signed up; maybe it was why they"

It might have been why they signed up; maybe it was why they\nsaid they fought. But in the sweat and blood and chaos and storm of the\nbattle, they fought for none of that. They fought for one another.\nWhen you stared down death, it was the people who mattered.\nAdolin trudged away from the last subcamp, carrying with him the\nhaunting sight of too many empty seats. How long had it been since he’d\nfelt confident in this war? Not in Azimir specifically—this entire war\nagainst the singers. It was starting to get to him. He stopped in place and\nlooked toward that bronze and stone dome. Inside, a crafty and relentless\nenemy continued to build larger and larger fortifications while Adolin’s\npeople were buzzing with exhaustionspren.\nAnd five days remained.\nWe’ll be reinforced, he told himself. Not long now. Just hold out until\nthen. So far there was no intel on the phantom force harrying the main\narmy, which was blessedly still making progress.\nHe checked the time using his aunt’s arm clock. There would be a\nhighstorm later today, but for now there were a few things he could do to\nhelp the battle. One was to fill those seats with new bodies. Yes, his defense\ndepended on having the best troops he could—as in tight confines he\ncouldn’t field many soldiers. But a body in a spot was better than none.\nWhen the enemy surged, he needed to clog their way. So he met Colot at a\nlarge staging area on the cobbles in front of the dome, where several\nhundred people had gathered.\nThe Azish military had all kinds of recruitment rules. They had entrance\nexams of all things. The resulting military was tight, disciplined, and well-\npaid, and it made for an excellent career. But it was not equipped to deal\nwith a draft, and it never let in outsiders.\nWhile Adolin … well, the Alethi were a different kind of fighting force.\nHis own honor guard was made up of men from all across the world, and\nhis father had trained him in a tactic that had been an Alethi tradition for\ncenturies: recruit like your life depended on it. He smiled, remembering\nTeleb talking about how he’d joined Dalinar’s army. Adolin’s father might\nspeak of people fighting for cause or kingdom, but the man’s success was\ndue in no small part to his own personal magnetism.\n“What have we got, Colot?” Adolin asked, surveying the lines of\npotential recruits.\n“You were right; there’s a lot to work with here. You have to be a\nspecific kind of smart to make it in the Azish military, which leaves a lot of\npeople out.” He paused. “Good thing we’re Alethi, or we’d be storming out\nof luck.”\nAdolin smiled. “I talked to Kushkam. Apparently the entrance exams\naren’t specifically to test intelligence—it’s an excuse to weed out bad\nactors. We’ll have many here who never tried out. But watch for those who\ndid and failed. Some of those will be too violent, too undisciplined, and will\nhave been failed for that—no matter the official reason.”"

Some of those will be too violent, too undisciplined, and will\nhave been failed for that—no matter the official reason.”\nColot grunted. “Strange way of doing it nonetheless.”\n“You done any weeding yet?”\n“They always take it better from you.”\nGreat. Adolin waved for Challa, his scribe of the day, to follow. She, like\nMay’s other wards, was a younger girl; she was slightly cross-eyed, and\nalways carried a piece of wood to fidget with. Desperate times meant\npeople did desperate things, like show up for recruitment when they weren’t\nfit for battle. When active fighting was nearby, people felt a growing need\nto do something. To not merely hide at home and wait.\nHe respected them for that. And there was a strong argument to be made:\nif the fate of the nation was at stake, then wouldn’t he want every recruit he\ncould get? The problem was, he had a limited number of people he could\ntrain and equip, and he had to make the best of that. More, he needed\nsoldiers who could face a warform singer and not be shoved around.\nSo, he separated out those who were too small. He didn’t actively\ndifferentiate between underage boys, the women with slight builds, and the\nmen who were too old or weak. But he still had to eliminate nine out of ten\npeople in line. He left mostly craftsmen of one sort or another, including a\nhandful of women with larger frames. As he pointed out each one, Challa\nmade a note, and Colot pulled them from the line.\nAdolin stopped by one taller woman, with good muscles on her, the\nstrongest he’d seen so far. She stood with her eyes straight forward at\nattention.\n“Name, soldier?” he asked her.\n“Sarqqin, sir,” she said.\n“Where’d you gain those muscles, Sarkuin?” he asked. Storms, he could\nnot get that sound right.\n“Blacksmithing, sir. I’ve apprenticed for seven years, and just been\nnamed master.”\n“Impressive,” he said. “Like I’ve told the other women, if I let you in,\nyou’ll have to live and work around men in what might be embarrassing\nsituations.”\n“I’m used to it, sir,” she said. “I have papers.”\nPapers? He hesitated, then glanced at his scribe.\n“One who has filled out the forms,” Challa the scribe whispered, “to live\nas a man.”\nAh. He’d heard of that. Well, the Azish did things their own way, didn’t\nthey?\n“Good to have you, Sarkuin,” Adolin said to the man, and moved on.\nThough he did make a note for Colot to assign him to a specific platoon\nwhere Adolin knew for a fact they’d been asking for a soldier with smithing\nexperience.\nBy the end, most of the people he hadn’t pulled out of the lines accepted\ntheir fate. In his experience, many had known they’d probably be\neliminated, but had forced themselves to sign up anyway. He had Colot\ngather them for other duties—surgeons needed help in the sick tent, and\nthere were always messages to run.

He\nturned to move on, and found himself face-to-face—well, chin-to-forehead\n—with an Azish girl who hadn’t been chosen.\nShe gave him a glare that could have punctured carapace. “Messenger?”\nshe demanded. “You’re assigning me to be a messenger?”\n“We always need messengers.”\n“I can fight!” she said. “I might look lanky for a boy, sir, but I’ll surprise\nyou.”\n“For a boy?” Adolin said, peering at her once more. “Um … do you …\num … have papers?”\nShe glanced away. Then cursed under her breath. “No. Aqqil never\nneeded them. What gave me away?”\nAqqil. That sound again. How did they do that? Adolin inspected the\ngirl, taking in the baggy clothing, her hair recently cut short. She had the air\nof please-pretend-I-am-a-boy-so-I-can-kill-things. Like most militaries, the\nAzish did not recruit women, so this girl had likely assumed Adolin\nwouldn’t either.\n“Acwill?” Adolin said. “I assume she’s a girl from a story, who dressed\nup as a boy and went to war?”\nShe nodded. “She went to save her brother.”\n“It’s a famous story,” Challa whispered to him from the side. “I’ve read\nthe most modern rendition. Quite exciting!”\n“I had one of those I liked when I was young,” Adolin said. “My mother\nused to read it to me. About a girl who signed up because her brother was\ntoo sickly to serve. So, you and I share something …”\n“Zabra,” the young woman said.\n“… Zabra. But I’m sorry. I can use your help, but it will have to be\nrunning messages.”\n“Because I’m a girl?”\n“Because you can’t do the other jobs I need done.” He sighed, then\nwaved for her to follow him. She did, still glaring. “Have you ever seen a\nwarform up close, Zabra?”\n“No,” she admitted, scuttling along with him. “But I know what you’re\ngoing to say. They’re big. They’re heavy. Well, that means they’re slow.”\n“They’re not, actually,” he said. “That’s a mistake many people make.\nSome of the fastest soldiers I know are also the strongest.”\n“They’ll still die from a spear in them,” she said. “Size isn’t everything.”\n“No, it’s not,” he said, leading her to one of the armory tents. He sent\nChalla to fetch someone for him, then grabbed two large shields—meant for\nholding in front of a pike formation. He tossed one to Zabra.

A short time later, Colot strolled\nup with a replacement knife. “I told you they take it better from you.”\nAdolin grunted, sheathing the knife.\n“Warning,” Colot said. “You’re up for duty in the dome.”\nAdolin was barely halfway to his armorers when the bells sounded—the\nenemy was making an assault. He started running.\nChasmfiends could sing.\nEach of the beasts rose on an array of feet, turning a thick neck skyward\nand releasing a quartet of harmonizing notes, for they could call with\nmultiple voices at once. Venli had been warned, but still she thought it\nremarkable, as she found something familiar in the notes. They vibrated\nwithin her, deep down to her gemheart. There were tones to the planet,\nseparate from the rhythms her people heard. Perhaps these were the tones of\nthe gods. But if that was the case, why four?\nMore oddly, the very ground vibrated along.\nWatch, Venli, the stones whispered. See.\nSee the coming storm? No, the stones wanted her to watch them. So\nwhile all other eyes turned toward the chasmfiends or toward the east, Venli\ncrouched and watched sand dance on stone, vibrating as if it was hot and\neach grain was a little person, trying to keep from being scalded. They\nseparated, forming into groups … geometric divisions.\n“Are the chasmfiends doing this?” she asked.\nWe enhance. You can enhance further.\nWith Timbre’s encouragement, Venli drew in Stormlight and placed her\nhands on the ground—letting the vibration fill her—then pushed Stormlight\nout. The stone began to shift, becoming as if liquid. Often when she’d done\nthis, she’d commanded the stone to take certain shapes—molded in part by\nher will, in part by her fingers, as if she were making a bowl out of soft\ncrem. Today, she let the tones do the shaping.\nThe resulting pattern was curious to her. She pulled her hands back,\nStormlight evaporating, leaving a five-foot round section of rock distorted\ninto a tiny mountain range.\nTimbre thrummed with excitement. The Shattered Plains? Yes, Timbre\nsaid it looked exactly like the Shattered Plains.\nVenli didn’t see it. The Plains had chasms, while this had ridges.\nHowever, Timbre had flown above the Plains, and thought the similarity\nwas remarkable. It was true the shape of the place had always been unusual.\nShe looked to Thude and her mother, but both had gone running to help\nprepare the camp.\nVenli didn’t know how to help, so she stayed out of the way as the\nchasmfiends formed a ring against the storm, while their young gathered\ninside.

Though the camp had some permanent structures,\nthose weren’t fully trustworthy yet, so many listeners gathered here. It\nwasn’t quite like being indoors, but it was far better than being exposed.\nVenli stood with one hand up and pressed against the carapace chest of a\nbeast. She braced herself for the stormwall, and felt strangely peaceful as it\ncrashed across the chasmfiends, who growled and trumped at it in defiance.\nShe huddled down next to a small chasmfiend the size of an axehound.\nThough it had a wicked face and claws, it sidled up to her and rubbed the\ntop of its head on her shoulder. She had always imagined they were solitary,\nbut she supposed that was because she only saw them when they were\nhunting or searching for a place to pupate.\nLightning crashed outside, but the enormous chasmfiends protected them\nfrom the brunt of both wind and debris. At one point several chasmfiends\nroared, their trumpeting voices audible even over the howling wind. Venli\napproached the leg of the one sheltering her and gazed out at the passing\nStormstriders, enormous spren with long imbs. The striders didn’t seem to\ncare about the chasmfiends’ challenge, but she got the sense from the\nsatisfied trumps that the chasmfiends believed they had run the odd spren\noff.\nA few people slipped out from the shelter, off to seek new forms. She\nwasn’t certain she’d ever do that again—she liked the limber form of power\nshe held, so long as she could remain free from Odium’s interference by\nvirtue of Timbre. As the storm continued though, questions still bothered\nher. The storm was relevant for pupating chasmfiends, and they could use it\nfor smaller growth cycles elsewhere. She’d always assumed the\nchasmfiends came to the Plains to better access the storms—but there were\nhills out here that were taller.\nIt wasn’t the elevation. It was something else.\nShe ducked back within the shelter, such as it was, relatively dry as\nwater poured along the beast’s body outside, streaming down to the stones\nin the darkness. She didn’t experience a moment of clarity or stillness at the\ncenter of this storm, but she was well aware when the gemstones burst\nalight—tied in malen beards or gathered in baskets. She felt the strength\nthrum through her as she breathed in Light, then she knelt and placed her\nhands on the stones again.\nShow me, she thought.\nCome to the center.\nThe center of the camp here?\nNo. The center of the Plains. Your former home. But beware. A battle\nhappens there now.\nNarak. They meant Narak, the collection of plateaus at the heart of the\nShattered Plains.\nShow me what you can here, she asked, and poured more Stormlight into\nthe stones. Nearby, her mother and Bila moved over, joining a small crowd\nthat watched the stones liquefy and undulate before her.\nThey formed the Shattered Plains, as she’d seen before—with ridges\ninstead of chasms. They came to make a city, like the others, the stones said."

They brought with them power—power to make the stones vibrate.\nAn incredible power.\nShe saw the thoughts of the stones. This land had been home to singers\nonce, then to humans with a vaguely blue tint to their skin. They’d built a\ngrand nation, and had wanted a capital city, as befitted the other great\nnations. A tenth Oathgate. Beautiful walls and patterns of stone.\nThey had built it. With power.\nWhen was this? Venli asked.\nNot long ago, the stones said. Although she wondered if stones could\nunderstand mortal timescales.\nWhat happened around the same time?\nThey showed her, in another patch of stone. Urithiru being built. Soon\nafter, the coming of a great king … and Timbre knew him. The one known\nas Nohadon. Timbre pulsed. She was certain there had been no Radiants at\nthat time. They’d been founded during Nohadon’s reign, or soon after.\nThere weren’t any Radiants then, she thought to the stones. How?\nOnce, you sang with us, the stones said, needing no Radiant bond. The\nhumans were the same.\nYes … she’d heard this before, from the rock at Urithiru. Singers had\nlearned to use Surges long, long ago. However, the Radiant bond had\norganized and structured the powers. Something … something about using\nthe powers without that structure had been dangerous …\nBecause of the new gods, the stones thought with sorrow. They didn’t\nunderstand. No one understood the alien stones at the place’s heart.\nAlien stones?\nThe fourth moon. Now dead. Now fallen. With stone that is not quite\nstone. And when gods came here …\nStone went haywire, vibrating at insane speed. She saw people sink into\nit. She saw destruction. Terror. A landscape broken by the hand of Honor\nhimself. Why had he destroyed this city? Had it been because they’d dared\nuse Surges?\nWhen the ground settled—continuing to glow with Light—the little map\nshowed the Shattered Plains she knew. A broken landscape, fractured, but\nbearing a haunting sense of symmetry. A corpse. Why had Honor turned\nagainst them? And before that, where had they ever found the power for\nsuch an act? Sculpting an entire city? Even with a hundred Willshapers, she\ncouldn’t imagine that possibility.\nIt’s still here, the stones whispered.\n“What?” she asked. “The strange stone?”\nAnd more. Come and see.\nShe let the stones harden, and—to the beating sound of the rain—ran her\nfingers across them. Streams of water trickled in from the edges of the\nchasmfiends’ shelter, filling the miniature chasms.\n“When was this place broken?” Venli whispered, but immediately felt\nfoolish.\nNot long ago, the stones said.\nStones. They really had a bad sense of time.\nWhat else happened at the same time as the breaking?\nIt showed her nine figures, in a ring, with swords.

I couldn’t make out the words, but … I felt\nwarm.”\n“Like a familiar voice,” Jaxlim said, “welcoming me home …”\n“We need to make an expedition to Narak,” Venli said. “Leaving today,\nif we can. The stones say there is a secret there that we need to see. Those\nof you who want to know the truth should join me.” She paused. “There’s a\nwar happening there, so we’ll need to travel through the chasms, and hope\nthey are not too flooded.”\nIf I were to give you the fuel with which to set yourself aflame, the\nresulting bonfire would then become my fault and not yours. For\nwe all know what you are.\nJasnah arrived in Thaylen City fully armored, at the head of an entire\ndivision of Alethi troops. In this, she represented the change she had always\nwanted to see in the world. A woman capable of leading an army.\nYet ideas hounded her, as they always did. Phantom lights in the night to\ndistract. Had she truly made headway for other women, or had she merely\nbecome an exception that was suffered? What did it say that, in order to\npresent herself as strong, she put on armor and engaged in traditionally\nmasculine activities?\nCertainly it made a statement. But did it do harm as well, reinforcing that\nonly one kind of strength was valid? It was the eternal irony of the capable\nrhetorician: train to find holes in any philosophy, and that will inevitably\nextend to your own. An inquisitive mind did not stop asking questions just\nbecause it found answers.\nShe marched down the grand steps of the city—which, like Kharbranth\nand several other ocean ports, was built up the leeward side of a large hill.\nThaylen City was a metropolis that looked a little like a wide staircase, with\nbuildings settled across many separate tiers. She marched her armies into\nthe Royal Ward, the top tier of the city, then straight past the palace. They\ncontinued down past the Loft Wards to the Ancient Ward, near the bottom.\nShe was accompanied by an honor guard comprised entirely of former\nslaves. On paper they were free, having taken up weapons and been trained\nas proper paid soldiers. In her employ, she made their freedom a reality—\nand she sensed their gratitude. But life for most former slaves was a great\ndeal harsher. Former owners could not lash out at their queen, so they\nretaliated against those who least deserved it. She knew that some slaves, to\navoid this, were quietly doing their work as they had, with almost no pay.\nOthers were determined not to, and found that society was hostile toward\nthem—and that invisible chains had replaced literal ones.\nShe’d known all of this would happen.

Slaves had been freed by imperial\ndecree in Azir during the reign of Kasaakam the Magnanimous. Some\nslaves in Jah Keved had been granted an elevation to the next nahn after the\nsuccessful Bav uprising of 637. She had a half dozen records of smaller\ninstances, and had studied them all at length. Learn from the past, and you\ncould predict the future without needing any mystical talent.\nBut storms, harnessing that knowledge was proving—with each new\nevent—more difficult than she’d assumed. She worried that her many\nactions to facilitate change wouldn’t stick—that the human desire to create\nmisery and dominate one’s fellows would prove more durable than her\nreign.\nShe wished that were the lone worry plaguing her. Yet she also worried\nabout the power she had—that any Alethi monarch had—and how to set up\nchecks on that. And finally, there was the letter. The note she’d left for Wit,\nformally ending their relationship. It had been the right thing.\nPerhaps she should have done it in person, but she didn’t want it to\ndevolve into an argument. She’d started by simply writing out her thoughts\nfor herself. That had turned into a letter, and she did work so much better in\nwriting. He would understand. Even if he was angry.\nHer mind couldn’t be on that. It shouldn’t be. She walked, as the first\nfemale Alethi general in many generations, at the head of a group of freed\nslaves, to the defense of their closest ally. Outside strong—strong as\nShardplate. Inside constantly worried. At the bottom of the next flight of\nsteps, she met up with Fen, Kmakl, and multiple representatives of the\nmerchant council.\nShe gladly accepted introductions to several of their key military\nstrategists, Ivory offering his usual quiet commentary in her ear, and sent\nthem to talk to her officers about how to best integrate her forces with the\nlocal defenses. She had already made it clear that she would rely on the\ngenerals for actual strategy. She thought the generals appreciated that, but\nshe was also their queen, and getting straight answers out of anyone was\ndifficult. She had not thought she would miss the days when everyone was\nbrutally forthright with their opinions about her—she still bore the scars of\nthat ostracization. Yet at least she’d known at all times where she stood.\nStop focusing on yourself, Jasnah thought, frustrated that she’d fallen\ninto old ways of constant self-reflection. Fen needs you.\n“You seem concerned,” Jasnah said to the Thaylen queen as the two of\nthem walked up to the top of the city wall, overlooking the docks and the\nbay. Kmakl remained below, directing Jasnah’s troops to find their barracks\nin the Low Ward of the large steplike city.\n“We are soon to be invaded,” Fen said. “The fate of a great portion of the\nworld relies solely upon your uncle, a man who—despite everything—I\ncan’t completely say that I trust.

I maybe should have\nspoken out earlier about the way anyone who wants to learn to be Radiant\nends up moving to Urithiru, where their loyalty is to the Radiant orders\ninstead of their homeland.” She looked to Jasnah. “No offense, Jasnah, but\nwhy shouldn’t I be concerned?”\n“Sorry,” Jasnah said. “Poor choice of words.” Storms. She tried so hard\nto be precise with her language, yet here she’d defaulted to a common\nconversation starter. “I was simply hoping to discuss your defenses.”\n“We hope the trebuchets will help,” Fen said, pointing to several\nemplacements along the slope. “They could realistically sink a ship or two\non their way in. More, they might be able to deal with another of those\nstone monsters, if they appear.”\nThe Thaylen queen rested her hand on a portion of the stone railing that\nwas two-colored, with bronze to the left. Just over a year ago, the wall had\nbeen shattered by a thunderclast, a stone beast of towering size.\n“Fine work there,” Ivory whispered, his voice amused. Jasnah was the\none who had Soulcast this metal portion to seal the city up again.\nShe wasn’t certain a trebuchet would be effective against a thunderclast,\nso she had brought Stonewards. They couldn’t manipulate the rock of the\nthunderclast itself—that resisted their touch, as Shardplate refused to be\nLashed—but melting the ground beneath one, then solidifying it, had\nproven a perfectly valid counter to the monsters.\n“Storms,” Fen said, leaning forward, her arms crossed on the railing.\n“We’ve worked so hard to rebuild, and suddenly we’re straight back to war.\nWill I be the queen who suffered not one, but two cataclysmic invasions of\nher homeland?”\n“We have a great deal more experience now, Fen,” Jasnah said. “I\nbrought entire contingents of many Radiants.”\n“We still don’t have much of a navy,” Fen whispered. “Even with all our\nwork over the last year, what we have is a pale imitation of our former\nglory. What is Thaylenah without the best fleet on the oceans?”\nA year of recruitment and training could repair her military, and help\nfrom Radiants and Soulcasters could rebuild a wall with incredible speed,\nbut good ships took time. The wood Soulcasters that Thaylenah had\nacquired from Aimia were a tremendous boon, but ships themselves were\ntoo complex—too delicate, requiring too many different skills—to Soulcast.\nJasnah clearly remembered her own disappointment, when she was first\ntraining to Soulcast, that she couldn’t just conjure up intricate contraptions\nat will.\nIt would be years before Thaylenah had a fleet to boast of—and most of\nwhat they did have was watching the eastern and western seas to intercept\nenemy ships coming from those directions. No one had anticipated the\nVeden blockade falling so easily. By initial counts, some hundred enemy\nships were currently making their way across the channel.\n“How?” Fen said. “How did they build such a military to attack us\nagain?

There weren’t supposed to be sufficient enemy numbers in\nJah Keved to send another fleet full of ground forces. The blockade was\nonly supposed to stop resupplies into Veden City.”\n“We’ll know more in a few days, when that armada gets here,” Jasnah\nsaid.\n“Assuming the enemy doesn’t somehow bring in their storm again, to\nmove with unexpected speed. Odium could get those ships here in a few\nhours if he wanted.”\nIt was a possibility, and partly why Jasnah had needed to arrive while the\nenemy landing was days away yet. One thing was certain though: the\nenemy wanted Thaylen City. This would be an extremely difficult assault\nfor them, across an exposed bay, then against a tight fortification. The\nattack would be a bloodbath for the singers, assuming no surprises.\nLast time, there had been surprises. The defenders had been taken\nunaware at several distinct points, which was obviously why Fen was\nconcerned. Odium was willing to commit thousands of troops, all of his\nships, and a good portion of his air support to taking Thaylenah.\n“An ending is,” Ivory whispered, echoing her own thoughts.\nThis was it. No relenting. No retreating. Odium would throw bodies at\nthis wall until there was nothing left to throw. Until the heaps of the dead\nmade a ramp. Until the bay turned orange. Because victory here meant\ndomination for centuries—and a loss meant the enforced cessation of\nhostilities.\nThat was liberating. Because there would be only one more battle.\nIt was also terrifying. Because there would be no holding back for a\nfuture fight.\n“Come,” Fen said. “Last time, they caught us with our sails down and\nour anchor fouled on coral. I want to spend what hours we have thinking.\nWhat is he going to try this time, and how can we counter it?”\nJasnah nodded and followed her down the steps, her armored feet\nscraping stone. In this city, a year ago, Jasnah had first fully revealed to the\nworld the extent of her training and her oaths, as a Radiant of the Fourth\nIdeal. Though she still had not found the fifth, she was here now with far\nmore authority, far more troops, far more experience.\nEither she would be enough, or she would die in this defense. The time\nfor questions had passed.\n“I don’t like the way they’re gathering out there,” Leyten said as he and\nSigzil watched from the wall of Narak.\nRed lightning illuminated the amassing enemy forces on the plateau to\nthe west of Narak Four. Two or three hundred individuals with glowing red\neyes—and amid them, a new brand of Fused.

Twenty of them, among three hundred total enemies—but here,\neach was Fused with a few stormform Regals mixed in.\n“Shouldn’t they be taking shelter?” Leyten continued. “The convergence\nwill be happening any minute. Stormwall was sighted at the eastern\nwatchpost.”\nSigzil hunkered down by instinct, remembering the last time he’d seen\ntwo storms meet. That day, plateaus had shattered.\n“Ever wish you didn’t have to do any of this?” Leyten said, resting\nagainst the wall top. “That instead you could be back at Urithiru, goobering\naround?”\nSigzil blinked. The air seemed alive with crackling red lightning, and the\nstorms held their breaths as they prepared to clash. Tension wound inside\nhim like the springs of a crossbow. And yet, he couldn’t help asking.\n“… Goobering?”\n“You know,” Leyten said. “Poking around, working on projects here and\nthere. Doing inventory, running accounts, cleaning shelves. Just … living,\nwithout stressing about what you might or might not get done. Goobering.”\n“That is not a real word.”\nLeyten shrugged.\nSigzil sighed. “Is that a Lopen invention?”\n“Nah, comes from my grandmother,” Leyten said. “I just … Sig, I like it\nwhen the work is boring. Sometimes I even think I’d rather be back in the\nchasms, tinkering with my improvised armor, instead of out here having to\nkill. Does that make me a bad soldier?”\nSigzil shook his head. “No. I understand. I would rather be sticking\npeople to the ceiling and seeing how long they stay there. The thing is, the\nShattered Plains is the closest Alethkar has to a kingdom these days. Those\nfields, those lumberyards, the growing trade market at the warcamps. If we\ndon’t defend against conquest by this enemy … If we don’t fight here …”\n“Then nobody ever gets to goober.”\n“Please don’t phrase it like that.”\nThunder.\nHighstorm thunder sounded quite different from Everstorm thunder. The\nlatter was often a sharp crack rather than a boom. The Everstorm was like\nwhips being snapped, omnipresent, almost constant—but the highstorm\nknew how to let a thunderbolt linger. More a mountain crumbling than a\nwhipcrack.\nNo confluence had ever been as destructive as that first one, so he hoped\ntoday wouldn’t be too terrible. Still, Sigzil huddled lower on the stone wall\nand looked to the east.

It was more pure a blue at the\nShattered Plains than it had been in Azir. Here, it had recently come in over\nthe ocean, and was at its strongest, carrying the sea itself.\nSigzil saw it, and strangely felt hope. The highstorm would kill him if it\ncould, he knew. It was violent and terrible. It also for some reason felt right.\nIt belonged to Roshar, unlike the awful black and red darkness above him\nnow. The highstorm brought life. Water to drink. Light to see by and to\ngrant powers. The storm carried Roshar itself—the stone they stood upon\nwas dropped, as crem, with the rain.\nStupid though it was, Sigzil stood up taller. Below, people were running\nfor bunkers created by Stonewards, but Sigzil found himself welcoming the\nhighstorm. Out on that plateau, the Fused didn’t flinch. The Everstorm\nclouds grew excited, like they were boiling, the lightning more fierce.\nThe highstorm struck …\nAnd began to die.\nThe highstorm faltered, water crashing down, the stormwall breaking\napart. The grey-blue was somehow consumed by the black and deep red.\nThe highstorm didn’t go easily, but it did go quickly, with booms and\ntantrums.\nWhen it hit Sigzil a few minutes later, all that remained was a hard rain\nthat passed in a few minutes, becoming a trickle.\n“What on Damnation itself was that?” Leyten hissed.\nSigzil shook his head again. “It was like … like two kings met, and one\nwas forced to bow.”\n“That seems a very bad sign,” Leyten said. “What about the\nStormfather?”\nThroughout the camp, gemstones flickered and became bright, so at least\nthe highstorm remained functional. But the wind was nearly nonexistent,\nand the rain a mild annoyance. As far as he knew, this had never before\nhappened at a convergence.\nOutside, those Fused went on the march, a group of Skybreakers flying\nup to support them. “This worries me,” Vienta whispered in his ear. “First\nthe strange behavior of the highstorm, now … I can’t put my finger on it\n…”\n“Only Skybreakers supporting them,” Sigzil said. “And a new brand of\nFused to keep our attention.

We can stand, here. We will.”\nThe enemy formed up to strike at Narak Four.

Yet inside, he still reeled at the\nimplications of the highstorm having turned into a whimpering axehound.\nSoldiers cheered anyway, filling the walls, ready to fight in the pelting\nrain. As more and more joined him on the walls, they were confronted with\na daunting sight. The Focused Ones drew close, then their bodies started to\n… well, condense.\nThe many layers that formed what seemed to be a fat being began to pull\ninward somehow. It had the look of dozens of belts cinching tighter and\ntighter—weaving underneath each other. Like coils of rope yanked at both\nends. As those folds condensed, they started to outline muscles, or maybe\nbecome muscles.\nWhen they’d fully grown taut, each Focused One had transformed into a\ntall, sculpted, androgynous figure that projected strength. As if they had\nbeen a relaxed spring, which had now been wound, the extra folds pulling\ntight against their powerful bodies. Master Hoid had warned that they’d\nweigh even more than a Magnified One, and that their density would grant\nthem incredible strength and—though Sigzil found it hard to believe—the\nability to stop a Shardblade.\nThe rest of the ground force was made up mostly of Magnified Ones—\nwho could grow carapace at will, and walked as hulking mountains, often\nwith arms transformed into spiked bludgeons. Together, these began tearing\nup the wooden planking on the ground beneath them—placed to interrupt\nany Deepest Ones. Sigzil thought they might be trying to taunt him to attack\nthem outside the fortification. He sent a message to the ground-force\ngenerals, and they concurred.\nWell, the enemy could rip up as much planking as they wanted. Sigzil\npassed orders for the defenders to wait. “They’ll need to cross that chasm,”\nhe said to the soldiers clustered on the wall top with him, “then climb this\nwall somehow. They’re at a disadvantage unless they have …”\nHe trailed off as he heard something. Loud, stone-on-stone footfalls. And\nin the distance, red lightning outlined a gigantic thunderclast approaching.\nIt appeared the enemy had a plan to get through the wall after all.\nAs for Valor, our dealings are none of your business—for largely\nthe same reasons. Can you not leave her alone?\nDalinar didn’t spend long in the chaos this time. Using the little engraved\nstone, he pulled himself, Gav, and Navani through to the next vision almost\nimmediately.\nIn moments, the three of them appeared on solid, familiar stone. Storms,\nit was good to feel rock beneath his feet. He turned and saw another camp\nfull of old-fashioned tents, populated by humans of mixed heritage. Few\nShin, except Ishar and maybe Ash. He picked out many individuals here\nwho might have been Alethi, Veden, Reshi, Marati, Thaylen, and Azish. No"

No\nHorneaters, Natan, Iriali, or their cousins the Rirans.\nA few small horses carried packs nearby, but he still didn’t see any\nwagons, nor any permanent buildings. Glancing around, he spotted Jezrien,\nwho wore a cloak and tunic of a rough blue cloth.\n“We’re on the other side of the mountains this time, based on these\ntrees,” Navani said. She touched a nearby branch and the leaves pulled in.\n“We’ve gone with them on their expedition to Azir, perhaps? So … maybe\nonly a few weeks have passed between visions for these people?”\nShalash stood by a tent, and she now appeared like a mature woman in\nher twenties. She carried a spear.\n“I think it’s been more than a few weeks,” Dalinar said. “Look at\nShalash—and Ishar, see him over there, walking with Jezrien to that tent?\nBoth look exactly as they do during our era. This is it. What I wanted. The\nday when …”\n“When they became truly immortal,” Navani said, holding Gav’s hand.\n“I found this stone disc,” Dalinar explained, “which connects Nale and\nJezrien. I knew Nale had to be there when the Oathpact was formed.”\nThey did seem to be actively at war, judging by the people carefully\nchipping out new stone arrowheads. Because the chipped edges looked less\nrefined than those of steel arrowheads, Dalinar had imagined the process\nwas haphazard. Now—as he saw the knappers expertly crafting them with\nstone tools and leather to scrape against—his perspective changed. These\nwere masters, creating weapons with as much skill and care as a modern\nswordsmith.\nFor the first time, he had a glimpse of how Jasnah understood history. He\nwished he had a few hours to go talk to those knappers, and the fletchers\nbeside them, to see their work in detail and experience a world where this\nwas cutting-edge technology.\n“The disc worked,” he said to Navani, checking his clock. “And we\ndidn’t even lose an hour between visions. I want to witness today’s events,\nbut afterward we have thousands of years to cover before reaching the fall\nof Honor and the secrets of how to obtain his power. We’ll need to find a\nfaster way.”\n“Agreed,” Navani said. “For now, though, I’m just glad we managed to\nget here. To this day.”\nRenarin appeared in a vision, wearing something between a robe and a very\nloose dress, blue, tied at the waist. He glanced around, trying not to look\npanicked.\nHe could do this. Support Shallan, find the Ghostbloods, attack them.\nReaffirming the goal calmed him, let him assess his surroundings. He was\nin a hogshide tent, which was comforting. When he was outdoors there\ncould be a lot to see—too much to keep track of. He stood on a rough-\nwoven rug, dyed blue and made of coarser fibers than he was used to. He\nwished he could feel it with his toes, but he was wearing slippers."

He\nwished he could feel it with his toes, but he was wearing slippers.\nPeople were talking outside, but in here he was alone. Alone. That sent a\nspike of alarm through him. He was supposed to stay close to Shallan, yet\nthey appeared to have been split up as they were sent into the vision.\nI’m sorry, Glys said. This is not the vision I intended. We missed one, one\nthat started right after. But Renarin, your father is here. Outside.\nSomeone pushed into the tent, but it wasn’t his father. It was an older\nman, bald but with a white beard, squared off like an ardent’s. He crossed\nthe room hurriedly, and was followed into the tent by a woman with\nflaming red hair and a kind of militaristic outfit of hogshide and fur.\n“The time has arrived,” the older man said, stalking straight up to\nRenarin. “Are you ready? Can you do what I asked?”\nOh, storms, Renarin thought, shying away. Dared he hope one of these\nwas Shallan or Rlain? Like before, they would be wearing the face of\nsomeone else in the vision. How could he signal to friends who he was\nwithout revealing himself?\n“Well?” the man demanded.\n“I’m ready,” Renarin forced out.\n“Ishar,” the redheaded woman said, stepping closer to the man. “Are you\ncertain about this plan?”\nIshar? A Herald? Or just named after a Herald? He did have the look of\nmany of the paintings. Storms.\n“I’ve spent decades planning,” Ishar said. He then gestured to Renarin.\n“And do you know anyone more capable than Vedel?”\nVedel. Another Herald.\n“Yes,” said the redheaded woman, almost certainly Chanaranach. “You,\nIshar. You’re more capable than all of us.”\n“I will facilitate the bond,” he said. “But I need someone with skill in\nRegrowth to make certain our immortality, and to make of us deities.”\n“Jezrien doesn’t want to be a deity,” Chana said. “We’re going along\nwith this, but it worries me, Ishar, how you speak sometimes.”\n“It is only because I feel it has to be done,” Ishar said. “Right, Vedel?”\nThese weren’t real people. This wasn’t a real situation. That didn’t make\nhim any less nervous, but if he had faced the Fused, he could face these.\n“Immortality,” he said. “Is that so important to you?”\n“Of course not,” Ishar said, perhaps too quickly. “I want to protect the\nworld, as Jezrien has demanded. Immortality is a side effect.”\n“Seems selfish,” Renarin said, and Chana nodded. He wasn’t certain he\ndid see it as selfish, but … well, people argued when they had big emotions.\n“Haven’t you felt it?” Ishar asked him, his tone changing from defensive\nto … concerned. “Doesn’t it unnerve you? Our bodies aging, albeit slowly?\nYou may think I’m selfish, but I am frightened of old age, Vedel. I do not\nwant to be senile for a thousand years. We brought the people to this cursed"

We brought the people to this cursed\nworld, with its treasonous inhabitants. We burned the old one. So I’m going\nto fix things. I need the time to do so.”\nChana eyed him, but finally nodded. Hesitant, Renarin did likewise. It\ndidn’t appear either of these was secretly one of the Ghostbloods.\n“Be ready to take the bond,” Ishar said, “and accept the power of Honor.\nI need you for this, Vedel. I’ll be back soon.”\nAs Dalinar was studying the camp, someone walked past, saw Gav, and\nmumbled the same thing from the previous vision. “What an odd spren …”\nApparently the visions still chose to present Gav as a spren to explain his\npresence. People would see him, then shake their heads and move on,\nignoring him from there on out.\n“I wonder,” Navani said, “if we could find an anchor that will guide us\nthrough multiple visions. Something relevant at a number of points in the\nfuture. That might help us jump more quickly between them.”\nDalinar nodded, considering that. But how to do it?\nNavani knelt, putting Gav down. He was old enough that carrying him\nwas difficult, even if he was small for his five years. “Gemheart?” she\nasked. “Are you all right?”\n“I don’t like this,” Gav whispered. “I don’t like how things keep\nchanging.”\n“Don’t worry,” Navani said, giving him a hug. “We’ll go home soon.\nRemember, nothing in here can hurt you. It’s pretend.”\n“You want something here?” he asked. “You’re looking for something\nyou lost?”\n“Looking,” Dalinar said, trying to find the words to explain it, “for a way\nto become a mighty warrior—capable of defeating the greatest enemy I’ve\never known.”\nThat was evidently the right thing, because Gav looked interested for the\nfirst time. “I want that, Grampa,” he whispered. “I want that too.”\nThey crossed the camp toward Jezrien, and Dalinar spotted more signs\nthat this was a warcamp. Those men jogging back into the camp? Scouts.\nThey wore no armor, not even leathers, just some strange animal skins.\nThey had the build of runners, and carried bows but no spears.\nThere were virtually no women. He was accustomed to scribes and\nfemale quartermasters, and nowadays female Radiants. Here, he didn’t even\nsee camp followers. Some men were washing clothing in a barrel, and he\nfigured that they didn’t have Soulcasters for food or infrastructure. That\nhampered large military movements, so you had to have smaller teams,\neach trained to do more jobs, to stay mobile. He passed some men\nbutchering the carcass of a large numul—a type of midsized shellbeast he’d\nseen occasionally in the West. An army here likely provisioned itself by\nfollowing the herds while on campaign.\nDalinar halted near the butchers, spotting something.\n“What?” Navani whispered.\n“They have thrown the gemheart in with the scrap ligaments and the\nbroken carapace chunks,” he whispered back. “They don’t seem to know"

        "text": "“What?” Navani whispered.\n“They have thrown the gemheart in with the scrap ligaments and the\nbroken carapace chunks,” he whispered back. “They don’t seem to know\nwhat it is.”\nIn many beasts the gemheart wasn’t so glorious and brilliant as it was in\na chasmfiend. This one’s cloudy, inch-long gemstone was covered in a web\nof sinew. But still … that had more value than the meat. The Azish ranched\nthese beasts in great numbers, using their inferior gemhearts to make bronze\nwith their Soulcasters.\nSo strange. They moved on, and Dalinar noticed other oddities. It\nsmelled wrong. Even the sweat of the bodies was somehow different, more\nmusky, more pungent. He could hear hogshide flaps being beaten for\ncleaning, but no familiar sounds like the sharpening of swords or the clang\nof buckets. This was almost an alien world. Yet they did appear to be\npreparing for an upcoming skirmish. He could pick that out in their quick\nmotions, hurried as if they were trying to finish on a deadline. Or maybe …\nYes. His answer came as the sky began to darken. Highstorm. They were\non the east side of the mountains. Exposed. Why was nobody running for\ncover? And … what kind of cover could all these loose tents offer anyway?\nHe grabbed Gav in both arms, planning to run for a hillside, but the Wind’s\nvoice spoke in his mind.\nHiding isn’t necessary, the Wind said. They prayed, and Honor listened\nto such prayers during this time. He will modulate the storm in this small\nregion, preventing it from destroying his faithful.\nHe glanced at Navani, whose eyes were wide. She’d heard it too. They\nstood in the center of the ancient camp, Dalinar’s nerves taut as bowstrings,\nuntil rain started falling. Along with a gentle wind streaming among the\nsoldiers, almost visible—a thick wind, turgid, lazy.\nMen in the camp stood up and looked toward the sky. They didn’t try to\nget out of the warm rain, though they laughed and pointed at passing\nwindspren.\nGavinor relaxed. “Oh …” the child said softly. “I feel warm …”\nBlood of my fathers, Dalinar thought. It’s true. He did feel warm—from\na blossom of heat within. He thought he recognized that warmth from\nsomewhere, and it was accompanied by a faint but audible tone that\nvibrated against his soul with the smooth, satisfying touch of a polishing\ncloth on a sword.\nRenarin stood there, hearing rain fall on the tent and feeling overwhelmed.\nStorms, it sounded like today was the founding of the Oathpact.\nStill, he needed to find the others. We should have agreed on some sort\nof hand signal or something, he thought, searching a nearby tabletop for a\nweapon. He didn’t find any, though the buckle on a small leather strap gave\nhim something to fidget with. A moment later someone else entered. A\nwoman who looked Veden, wearing vibrant green clothing. Renarin drew\nfarther back into the shadows of the tent, worried he’d have to navigate his\nway through another conversation. The woman glanced around, noticed\nhim, then turned indifferently and started studying the ceiling. Then she\nhummed briefly.\nWait. That had been one of the rhythms."

That had been one of the rhythms.\n“Rlain?” Renarin guessed, stepping into the light.\n“It is you,” the woman said, looking relieved. “I thought it might be,\nfrom the fidgeting.” Rlain rushed over. “We can understand people this\ntime, but I have no idea what I’m doing.”\n“Did you locate Shallan?”\n“Not yet,” he said. “I appeared, and started walking around awkwardly\nuntil a bald human passed by and told me to go in here, as it was ‘almost\ntime.’”\n“That was Ishar,” Renarin said. “Ishi’Elin … one of the Heralds. We’re\nabout to see the Oathpact be sworn.”\n“And the Ghostbloods want to interfere with that?”\n“No, remember, this isn’t actually the past,” Renarin said. Rlain didn’t\nhave experience with Dalinar’s visions. “The Ghostbloods think following\nDalinar will guide them to Mishram’s prison.” Renarin frowned. “I don’t\nknow why they’d think that, since Dalinar is hunting for what happened to\nHonor. Unless …”\n“Unless,” Rlain finished, “the events are connected.”\nStorms. “And the Ghostbloods know that somehow.”\n“It’s all wrapped up in one knot,” Rlain said, nodding. “The fall of your\ngod. The imprisonment of one of ours. The Radiants walking away from\ntheir vows, and the singers ending up in slaveform. Renarin … there are so\nmany secrets here.”\n“We’re only here to stop the Ghostbloods,” Renarin said.\n“But what if we could do more?” Rlain said. “What if we found the\nprison, so we could discover what truly happened? Not merely to the\nlisteners, but to all singers.” He hummed to an excited rhythm. “I think\nShallan was right to bring us. We need to know these secrets. I need to\nknow them.”\n“Because you’re a singer,” Renarin realized. “If we do go as far as\nShallan wants, and reach the prison ourselves … a singer should be\ninvolved, not just humans.”\n“No offense,” Rlain said, his rhythm changing. He hummed a little extra\nto indicate an emotion—something Renarin had noticed his kind did\nunconsciously after speaking a short sentence. “Renarin, I respect you, Kal,\nDalinar … all of you. But don’t you agree? Don’t you think that a singer\nought to have some involvement?”\n“You’re right, of course,” Renarin said, flipping the buckle open in his\nfingers. He could imagine how Rlain must feel, constantly surrounded by\npeople who had enslaved his. And … storms, he found it so much easier to\nread what Rlain was thinking when he hummed those rhythms to indicate\nhis emotional state. Why couldn’t humans do something like that?\nWhen he talked to Rlain, the entire world opened up to Renarin—he was\nno longer the blind one in conversations, struggling to figure out what\neveryone else was feeling while they all picked up on it effortlessly. It was a\nskill he’d had to practice, and he was proud of the improvements he’d\nmade."

It was a\nskill he’d had to practice, and he was proud of the improvements he’d\nmade.\nWith Rlain, he didn’t need that effort, and it made the entire conversation\nmore relaxing. Right up until Rlain asked something that sent a spike of\npanic through Renarin.\n“Can I touch you?”\n“What?” Renarin said.\n“Wearing these faces makes me nervous,” Rlain said, putting his hand to\nhis head and running his fingers through the Veden woman’s hair. “I find\nthe rhythms hard to hear, and this body isn’t just a Lightweaving. I don’t\nfeel my carapace anymore. It unnerves me.”\nRight. With someone else, Rlain would have simply reached out to grab\ntheir shoulder for support, but Renarin liked people to ask first. Right, right.\nThat was what Rlain was asking.\nHe nodded, and then tried to hum his emotions, which made Rlain smile.\nRlain took Renarin by the upper arm and held on, breathing deeply and\nhumming to himself. Renarin felt, in return, an unanticipated fire from that\ntouch. A warmth that spread through him, like the one that others had\nalways expected him to feel—told him he would. But which he’d never\nexperienced from the women his aunt and others presented for him.\nShould he say something? Like what? “I know we were just talking\nabout the enslavement of your people, but what’s your opinion on courting\nhumans?” Storms, it would be so awkward. Renarin didn’t think he had it in\nhim. Why ruin something nice? This was good enough, right?\n“Very well,” Rlain said, humming to what Renarin thought was Resolve,\n“how do we find Shallan?”\n“Others are still out there waiting?” Renarin asked, forcing himself to\nstay on task. It was the fate of the world they were trying to influence; he\nfelt selfish for letting his attention wander from that.\n“Yes,” Rlain said, letting go—unfortunately—and walking over to peek\nout the front of the tent. “Since it started raining, they’ve all been standing\naround.” He hummed to Peace, accompanying the patter of rain on the tent.\n“It’s the highstorm, Renarin, but … different. More soothing. I like this\nsensation. Anyway, I see a number of them who look important—though\nthe old man is under a canopy.”\n“Those are the Heralds,” Renarin said. “We have to assume Shallan is\nwith them, and our enemies too. Finding her and not them is going to be\ndifficult. Particularly for me, Rlain. I’m not good at subtext when it’s in my\nface, let alone when it’s on someone else’s face hiding behind yet a third\nface.”\n“Yeah,” Rlain said to Irritation. “Humans … don’t always make a lot of\nsense.”\nHowever … Renarin considered a moment. “There’s something I can do\nwith my powers, Rlain. It … well, it’s hard to explain. Glys says that\nLightweaving should be one of our Surges, but when I’ve tried it, I get\nsomething else.”\n“What does it do?” Rlain asked.\n“I think it shows me people’s souls,” Renarin whispered. “And their"

But I think maybe it\nwould help here, because if we can see people’s souls …”\n“We can see who’s who,” Rlain said, with a nod. “But if you do it, try\nnot to be too obvious.”\nThis … Glys said to him, his voice distant, this will be useful. This will\nbe good. Try.\nEncouraged, Renarin drew in Stormlight. It permeated this place, and\nhe’d already been holding a little unconsciously. Now, he knelt and\nmotioned for Rlain to sit.\nRenarin cupped his palms and … breathed out, capturing the Light in a\nsphere maybe six inches across, spinning, glowing, above his hand. Please,\nif you can, he thought, let me see—and let him see. The shadows that Light\ncast sometimes showed Renarin things, a little like the window visions. The\nones he could make on purpose were less distinct, more vague, but at least\nhe could control their timing.\nRlain stared into the sphere, and the light it cast from him made an\nimage: a singer standing as if on a border, one foot in the world of men—\nrepresented by a city with human architecture—another foot in the world of\nsingers, with each building in the more flowing designs of his people. He\nwore half a Bridge Four uniform, half a singer robe, accentuating his\ncarapace. All split right down the middle.\nIt was a clearer vision than Renarin usually got. And it seemed Rlain saw\nthe same thing when staring into the light in Renarin’s hand.\nFor a while, Dalinar just enjoyed the rain and the strange warmth. Nearby\nrockbuds opened up and flushed with sudden color, their shells going from\nbrown to a vibrant orange-red, spouting lifespren. Vines extended, grass\ncoming from its holes and stretching long blades toward the sky, like a man\nwaking from a deep slumber. Basins caught the rain, and he saw crem\ndishware near one of the cookfires.\nBe warned, the Wind said. The storm could be very cruel, and Honor\nmodulated it only in specific cases. I … was frightened of it at times. The\nsingers have armor for a reason.\n“Why?” Gav asked, surprising Dalinar by interacting with the spren.\n“Why are you nice?”\nWe are what Adonalsium left … the Wind said. And even the storm,\nbefore Honor, could be pled with at times …\n“The Stormfather never told me that,” Dalinar said. “The Stormfather\nsays the storm simply is. That it has no choice but to destroy.”\nThis is Roshar. Nothing merely is. Everything thinks. Everything has a\nchoice. Watch. As humans choose.\nGav walking hand in hand with Navani, the three crossed the ground to\njoin Jezrien with a small group looking to the sky, arms spread. The king\ntook a long, deep breath, uncaring that his fine clothing was getting wet. He\nnodded to them, then he turned to the scouts Dalinar had noticed earlier.\n“All right,” Jezrien said. “Kalak has finally decided to join us. You may\ngive your report.”"

You may\ngive your report.”\n“It’s him,” a scout said. A dark-skinned man with a birthmark on his\ncheek. Storms, that was Nale. Dalinar had met him once. “Your friend,\nJezrien. I’m sure of it.”\n“El is dead,” Jezrien whispered. “I stabbed him myself.”\n“And yet he lives,” Nale said. “Jezrien, if El has joined the Fused … not\nonly are our enemies being reborn, but they are recruiting the strongest and\nmost talented singers to immortality. We have to counter it, or we will lose\nthis war.”\n“Ishar was correct all along, Jezrien,” Chana said—by his side, as she’d\nbeen in each previous vision. “This is Passion’s doing. Our god has fully\nbetrayed us.”\n“I believe we betrayed him first,” Jezrien said softly. “The moment I\nacknowledged that Nale had been correct, things started changing. He was\nnever Passion, Chana. Always Odium.”\n“How long has it been since that day …?” Navani said. “I sometimes\nlose track of time.”\n“Over forty years,” Jezrien said. “Forty-three long years of war …”\nDalinar winked at her, appreciating her clever manipulation of the\nconversation to get them information. “Are we planning campaigns?\nPerhaps battle maps I can see?” Maybe one of those would work for an\nanchor to the future.\n“Later,” Jezrien said. “This isn’t the time. You know that.”\nWell, a map probably wouldn’t get him far enough. He needed\nsomething persistent, something that would still be here in a thousand years\n… and still relevant …\nHis eyes opened wide as the answer occurred to him. He was about to\nwitness the founding of the Oathpact—and as part of that, ten eternal\nweapons would be formed. A link to each and every Desolation. The\nHonorblades. And if he was still Kalak … one would form in his own\nhands. An anchor that could carry him thousands of years into the future.\nThat’s the answer, he thought, excited. That has to be possible. And it\nwill come straight to me, if I play my role right and don’t disrupt what is\nhappening.\nRenarin held the Light for Rlain to see.\n“That’s marvelous,” Rlain said. “How do you do it?”\n“I just breathe out,” Renarin said, “and the Light gathers. I … um, I ask\nnicely too. That helps.”\n“Ask nicely?”\n“Yeah, the Light seems to respond more when I think a little request.”\n“Tumi called me the Bridger of Minds,” Rlain said, staring into the\nsphere. “Important singers have titles. That’s my future, my fate.”\n“Nothing is fated,” Renarin said. “I learned that painfully, Rlain. There is\nonly possibility and chance, maybe with nudges from outside forces. What\ncomes in the future is our choice.”\n“Like your father,” Rlain said, “not joining Odium at the battle of\nThaylen Field.”"

Unless it was still to come.\nNot forced to follow Odium, but going willingly as part of their agreement.\nRlain held out his own hand, hesitantly trying to breathe out Stormlight\n—making a few attempts and not getting anything.\n“Don’t force it,” Renarin said. “Try being relaxed.”\n“Try being relaxed,” Rlain said, “while wearing a human woman’s body\nand seeking a pair of assassins who want to control the world, as I keep\nseeing faces of one of the Unmade in patterns of dust on the ground. Right.\nNo problem.”\n“Nice rhythm,” Renarin said, amused at how this particular one\nemphasized the sarcasm.\n“Thanks,” Rlain said.\nRenarin dismissed his sphere and left Rlain to it, instead checking out\nthe front of the large tent. In the camp beyond, thick tarps dripped with\nwater from the continuing rainfall. The air was cold, crisp, and wet. Jasnah\nwould love this, Renarin thought, taking in the antiquated clothing, the\nweapons chipped from stone.\nHis father and Navani had arrived to speak with some people in clothes\nmore colorful than most, though still relatively simple by modern terms. He\ncould, as before, see Dalinar and Navani as themselves—they weren’t\nhidden by their spren, the way both the Ghostbloods and Renarin’s group\nwere. And … Damnation. Was that Gavinor? Why had Dalinar and Navani\nbrought a child into the Spiritual Realm?\nWho among that group with his father was secretly an enemy? Who was\na friend?\nGlys, he thought, I need to be able to use my powers without alerting\neveryone in the room. Is there a … stealthier way to shine my light on them?\nNot that I know of, Glys said.

But he held out his hand—absently realizing it\nwas an unsleeved safehand, which was amusing—and tried forming a small\nLight. Unfortunately, it was too distant to reveal anything about the group\noutside. Renarin puzzled through options as behind him, Rlain hummed an\nexcited rhythm.\n“I got some!” he said. “A little bit, at least. It came out and is forming.”\n“Excellent,” Renarin said, glancing at the desk, where a few gemstones\nhad been set out. Raw, uncut gemstones, yes, but glowing nonetheless.\nWhat if he stood over there and made Light? Maybe no one would notice it\ncame from him.\nOr, well, he was imitating a Herald, wasn’t he? Maybe they could use\ntheir powers in the open. He was Vedeledev … an Edgedancer. That\nwouldn’t fit. But Rlain seemed to be Pailiah, who was a Truthwatcher, so it\nshould be fine for him.\nThat could work, maybe, Glys said. Also, maybe if you use less Light, the\neffects might be less noticeable."

As he was thinking, Renarin saw the\ngroup, including his father and aunt, striding across the wet ground toward\ntheir tent.\nRenarin pulled the flaps closed. “They’re coming back and—” He cut off\nas he found Rlain kneeling and holding a sphere of Light, wide-eyed. In the\nlight cast by that sphere, Renarin saw himself and Rlain.\nThey were kissing.\nOh.\nStorms, there wasn’t time for this.\n“They’re coming,” Renarin said, rushing to him. “Dismiss the sphere!”\n“How?” Rlain asked. “I don’t even know how I summoned it. I—”\nThe front flaps of the tent opened, and people began to pile in.\nBefore Dalinar could explain to Navani his plan to get an Honorblade—\nthen use that as an anchor—Jezrien started walking, and Dalinar decided he\nshould stick close. Together they joined Ishar. The elder Herald stood a\nslight distance apart from the others, hands clasped behind his back. He was\nwith a woman who could have been Alethi, or maybe not—she had silvery\nhair. They were the only two who had chosen to stand under cover when the\nrains arrived.\n“Battar,” Nale said to the woman with Ishar, making another of the odd\ngestures Dalinar didn’t understand, touching fingers to forehead. “I find\nmyself oddly glad I never managed to kill you.”\n“Nale,” she said. “Always the brilliant conversationalist. I’ve news you\nneed to hear.”\n“I don’t really care,” Nale said, his words stiff, clipped. “I’m heading\nback out on patrol.”\nJezrien sighed. He looked to Dalinar for help.\n“Must we rehash old arguments?” Dalinar said, carefully. “Can we not\nlet the past fade, and look to the future?”\n“Agreed,” Navani said. “Human must stand with human in this world.”\nJezrien nodded to the rest of the camp, particularly some Makabaki\nsoldiers nearby. “They listen to you, Nale. Even if you don’t rule. Please.\nLet us do this together.”\n“Just because I’m older than them is no reason for me to rule,” Nale said.\n“We don’t work the same way you do, Althman. Thankfully.”\n“Please,” Navani said, gentle. “If there’s information to share, we all\nneed to hear it.” She was quickly learning how to manipulate the situation.\n“Midius is right,” Jezrien said, nodding to Navani, which gave Dalinar a\nstart. Midius … that was their name for Wit. Dalinar had assumed she was\nin Vedeledev’s body again, but evidently not. They’d appeared hand in\nhand, so maybe the vision had needed to place them into bodies of people\nstanding near one another.\nJezrien moved toward a large nearby tent, and the others joined him.\nChana, the bodyguard.

Finally Nale, with a sigh.\nTogether, this group was seven of the ten Heralds, plus Wit. As Dalinar\nentered the tent, he recognized Pailiah instantly, wearing green cloth that\nstood out so much from the furs of the others. With tan skin and a Veden\nlook, she was Lightweaving. She sat on the floor inside the tent, and a globe\nof Light hovered above her hand.\nBehind them, Nale hissed, angerspren boiling at his feet. “You swore\nyou wouldn’t use the powers any longer, Althman. This is forbidden.”\n“We need to know what is coming,” Jezrien said. “And Pralla sees the\ntruth, as it might be. She always has.”\n“That’s eight,” Navani whispered to Dalinar, still hand in hand with Gav,\nwho glanced around, interested. At the moment he seemed more curious\nthan afraid. The others ignored him, as one might a lingering emotion spren.\nOf all those here, Dalinar was most interested in Nale, and his explicit\nhostility toward the others. He’d recently seen visions of this man. Perhaps\nvisions of this very day. Nale had been an enemy to the others …\nBut where was Taln? The one they abandoned. As the group entered the\ntent—including some Vorin and Makabaki bodyguards—Dalinar searched\namong them. He’d met Taln in the modern day, and the hulking soldier\nwould stand out in a crowd. He wasn’t here. There was one other person in\nthe room though—one who had been hidden in a darkened corner, but was\nrevealed as they lit lanterns. This had to be Vedeledev, a woman with long\ndark hair bearing a slight curl. She looked Alethi or Veden to him, though\nher skin was paler, like she was from near the Horneater Peaks.\nNavani’s breath caught audibly.\n“What?” Dalinar whispered to her.\n“I was in her body before,” Navani whispered. “Now I get to see her.\nVedeledev. Keeper of the keys.”\n“I’ve always wondered what they were the keys to,” he said. Scholars\ntended to swear by her name.\n“The keys of immortality,” Navani whispered, her eyes wide as Vedel\nturned to the gathered group. “It’s happening.”\n“It is time,” Jezrien said to Vedel. “Is he ready?”\nVedel didn’t respond, looking strangely panicked.\n“Vedel?” Jezrien asked. “It is time. Show us.”\nAs everyone entered the tent, Renarin sought the shadows by instinct. Rlain\ncontinued kneeling on the ground, and fortunately, none of them thought his\nLightweaving was odd—at least not until a tall Makabaki man at the back\nsnapped that they shouldn’t be using the powers.\nRenarin stepped forward, hoping to draw attention away from Rlain—\nbut as he did, his father looked straight at him, sparking an entire host of\nemotions.

Happiness at seeing someone who could take charge—shame at\nnot feeling like he should take charge himself. Embarrassment at not being\nable to say anything to indicate who he was. Even a bit of resentment. It\nwas always there, part of their relationship. You couldn’t banish such things\nwith a wave of the hand.\nThose thoughts and worries all fled as a stately, Alethi-looking man—\nprobably Jezrien—spoke to Renarin.\n“It is time,” he said. “Is he ready?”\nStorms!\n“Vedel?” Jezrien asked. “It is time. Show us.”\nAnd the whole room waited for Renarin to answer.\nYou need not always have the last word, though I know you\ncollect them like badges of honor. I will not tell you where she is.\nAll his life, Renarin had struggled to figure out what people wanted of him.\nIt was the great recurring theme of his existence. He’d say the wrong\nthing, or more commonly not say something everyone expected him to, and\nthe whole room would look at him just as they did now, in that tent full of\nfuture Heralds. Waiting.\nHe usually withdrew until the uncomfortable moment passed. In doing\nso, he suspected he’d trained those closest to him to ignore him. It hurt,\nbecause he wanted to understand—more, he wanted them to understand\nhim. Still, for so much of his life, silence had been his defense. Say nothing.\nAccept that they thought him odd, which was better than them being\noffended.\nToday that wouldn’t work. Today he had put himself in a position where\nnot speaking would reveal him to assassins who prowled with other faces.\nExcept …\n“Vedel?” the king asked again.\nExcept this had all happened before. In most conversations, there was no\nway to know the right answers. Today, however, the right answer existed—\nhe merely needed the script.\nOh! Glys said, his voice distant as he watched from outside. Oh, this will\nwork! This is possible!\nYou can see what happened in the original event? Renarin thought to\nhim. The one the vision is copying.\nYes, Glys said. Now that you’re inside it, yes! Say this, Renarin. Say,\n“Yes, we presented Ishar’s plan to him, and he listened. All is ready—as am\nI.”\nRenarin relayed the words, which made Jezrien nod in satisfaction. One\nof the others, who had to be Nale, pushed forward. “Wait. I know you.\nVedel. The queen.”\n“Queen no longer,” Renarin said, repeating the words fed to him by\nGlys. “My people are dead. I am only a healer now.”\n“The talad …” Nale said.\nRenarin had no idea what that meant, but he didn’t need to. Storms, it\nwas such an incredible relief to—for once—know how to respond. To be\nable to participate in a conversation without anxiety or worry. Surely this\nwas how his father felt—always with an answer, always able to speak his\nmind.\nIs this what you will want? Glys asked. To always give answers\nexpected? What of individuality? What of spontaneity?"

What of spontaneity?\nIt was difficult to explain, even to one who could sense his feelings and\nthoughts. Renarin was … growing to respect who he was rather than who\nhe thought he should be. For much of his life that had been a struggle, as\nhe’d always felt insufficient. Not the warrior his father wanted. Not the\nreligious devotee the ardents wanted. Not the prince the people wanted.\nIn every way, he was a failure. That should make him want to rebel,\nthrow it all away, find his own path. But he loved these people—his father,\nhis aunt, the ardents like Kadash, his brother, and the people of Alethkar. He\nknew he shouldn’t derive his self-worth from being what they expected, but\nsurely there was good in pleasing others? He—\nWait, Glys said. Renarin, wait! Renarin, this will be wrong!\nRenarin felt a panic, thinking that in his musings, he’d missed a cue. But\n… it wasn’t him. It was Gav, standing in front of Navani. He must be in the\nbody of someone unimportant, because the others didn’t appear to care\nmuch what he did.\nBut Gav had asked a question. And that set Renarin’s mental connection\nto Glys abuzz.\nThat wasn’t what the vision says will happen! Glys explained. That one\nisn’t following the script.\nYes, that’s Gav, Renarin sent. He can’t really play along. That doesn’t tell\nus anything though, because …\nWait. Storms.\nThat’s how we can tell! Renarin realized. All the actual members of the\nvision know what they’re supposed to say, but intruders will not. The\nGhostbloods would out themselves by not following the vision exactly.\nNot necessarily, Glys said. They will maybe have learned the same secret\nas you—and if one person goes off script, the others will too.\nRight. He’d have to be careful about making assumptions. But this at\nleast seemed like a possible way to find the assassins hidden in the vision.\nYou will speak, Glys prompted him, as he’d not been following the\nconversation.

Chips and chunks of stone fell across Sigzil in the darkness—\nmade suddenly light as a Skybreaker started setting the air ablaze.\nGenerals sent ground troops to fill the gap. And fortunately, the\nthunderclast’s feet finally started to sink into the plateau behind her. By\nstaying braced across the chasm using both legs and one arm long enough\nto break open the wall with her other fist, she had allowed Stonewards\nclimbing the chasm wall enough time to make the plateau edge soft\nunderneath her feet.

The thirty-foot-tall monster—which looked vaguely\nskeletal, with a grand arrowhead face—trumped as her feet sank in. Five\nEdgedancers with Blades slid forward and began chopping at her, and Sigzil\njoined them, shaking off his daze and summoning his spear—then soaring\nforward and ramming it through one glowing stone eye.\nShe stilled, and her eyes faded, the light going out. She’d done her\ndamage though—her corpse formed a bridge in through the wall. Magnified\nOnes sprang from the nearby plateau onto her back, then ran forward and\nleaped over her head onto Narak Four.\n“All Radiants, form a defensive perimeter and let the troops reset their\nlines!” Sigzil shouted, swooping down near the scribe station.\n“Do we retreat, sir?” one of the generals asked. “The wall is breached!”\n“No,” Sigzil said. “It’s only the fifth day—we need to hold as long as we\ncan. Prepare for a retreat, but we need to see if we can hold here. Ka, get me\nthe Stormwall now!”\nSigzil took a stance nearby, putting himself between enormous\nMagnified Ones and the path to Narak Two, the Oathgate. He engaged the\nfirst few. His squires, then Skar and his squires, formed up around him.\nWindrunners fulfilled many roles on a battlefield. Scouts, yes, but often\nmore akin to cavalry—fast, responsive, capable of getting to a situation and\nholding a line while slower troops were maneuvering.\nEdgedancers joined them, and the Radiants fought the Fused together.\nEach grouped off into individual duels, not out of honor, but because a\nRadiant or Fused was like a single-unit army unto themself. There weren’t\nthe raw numbers to form blocks of troops—and the fighting styles of\nRadiants, particularly with Blades, often required space.\nNearby, an Edgedancer shouted as she fell to a Focused One: the new\nbrand, with a sleek, sculpted form, made up of overlapping belts. Like a\nbody embalmed, wrapped in cloth, except each piece instead was like a\nleather strap. As Sigzil tried to go to the Edgedancer’s aid, the Focused One\nsmashed her head with its foot, completely crushing her spine and skull. A\nwound even Stormlight couldn’t heal. Sigzil cursed and left his squires\nfacing off against two Magnified Ones—they had the experience for that—\nand flew toward the Focused One.\nUnlike the Magnified Ones, this thing didn’t run or leap as it turned\ntoward him. This tall, sculpted being walked steadily, with a sense of\ninevitability. Unclothed, androgynous, it seemed malen to Sigzil—but they\nall did. That was probably just Sigzil defaulting to an assumption.\nIt didn’t flinch as Sigzil’s Shardspear hit it straight in the chest, sank in\nabout half an inch, then stopped. Storms, it was true.

Sigzil danced away as the thing lunged forward with incredible speed\n—like a spring uncoiling. Sigzil barely dodged, Lashing upward, his sweat\nmingling with the rain. Some of the thing’s calf muscles had unwrapped at\nthe motion, the folds right above the feet becoming loose, then sliding down\nlike many layers.\nAs he watched, they pulled tight again. Fascinating. He dove, putting a\nlittle more force behind his thrust, and managed to shove the spear in a\nfraction deeper. He was ready for the thing’s sudden motion this time, but\nhe still barely managed to dodge. Nearby, a group of heavy infantry—men\nin their strongest armor, carrying warhammers—formed a line. That was the\nbest way to fight Magnified Ones with conventional troops.\nA squad of these engaged a Focused One, who—with a jolt of motion—\ngrabbed one fully armored soldier by the head. The hand released its\ntension, folds around the forearm unraveling like coils of rope being given\nsudden slack. This time Sigzil saw more—the tension being released at the\nwrist was like a spring unwinding, and a great deal of that force was\ndelivered to the fingers. All that pent-up potential energy was transferred\ninto an already powerful grip.\nThe head burst. The helmet didn’t help.\nStorms. Though Vienta began whispering numbers to him, analyzing the\nforce transfer, the battle stopped being academic for Sigzil in that moment.\nHe moved, rallying troops with shouts and a raise of the spear.\nUnfortunately, the Skybreakers made another series of harrying strikes right\nthen. Alongside the other Windrunners, Sigzil was forced to give air\nsupport, lest the enemy drop behind their lines.\nThe next fifteen minutes were chaos in the skies, fighting through rain\nand fending off fellow humans who should have been on his side. He at last\ngot a moment to disengage to check on their defenses, ignoring the glowing\nred dot from one of the six spanreed rubies strapped to his arm. It indicated\nthat Leyten needed his attention, but that could wait.\nHis forces had managed to stop the enemy from overrunning the entire\nplateau. That was helped when a small squad of Windrunners arrived,\ncarrying ropes and lifting dangling figures: people in Shardplate. You\ncouldn’t lift Shardplate with Lashings, but you could Lash yourself upward\nand carry a Shardbearer with ropes. This group had been fighting off a\nsimultaneous attack on Narak Prime, but he needed them here more—and\nthis method of deployment was fastest.\nThe Windrunners cut their ropes, and four Shardbearers dropped to the\nbattlefield—splintering the wooden boards as they hit, Blades appearing in\ntheir hands. Finally a fifth man dropped, the one they called the Stormwall.\nDami, the Riran Stoneward. Shardplate formed around him—the largest,\nbulkiest suit Sigzil had ever seen, glowing a dangerous golden orange at its\nsymbol and joints. In that armor, Dami stood a head taller than even the\nfour conventional Shardbearers.\nSigzil hadn’t been with him in Emul when he’d said his Fourth Ideal, but"

In that armor, Dami stood a head taller than even the\nfour conventional Shardbearers.\nSigzil hadn’t been with him in Emul when he’d said his Fourth Ideal, but\nit had reportedly been spectacular. The Stormwall didn’t summon a\nShardblade, but an imposing tower shield, spiked and as tall as he was. He\nslammed it to the ground in front of him, then shoved a Magnified One out\nof the way while hitting another with a fist that crushed its face. Colorful\nribbons—tied around his wrists and extending out through the Plate—began\nmoving of their own accord; they spiraled outward around his fist and\nbecame like blades themselves, after the Stoneward art.\n“The Focused Ones!” an Edgedancer shouted, sliding past Sigzil in the\nrain, trailing fearspren like a train. “They can’t be killed! They can’t be\nkilled!”\nWell, that wouldn’t do. Time for some applied science.\n“Four Lashings,” Vienta whispered, “at three hundred feet should be\nenough, judging by the metrics you provided me.”\nSigzil gained some distance with a few Lashings, then came back in low,\nusing four Lashings in repeated succession. He skimmed across the top of\nthe plateau, darting past skirmishing groups, the speed of his passing\nmaking pooled water split behind him in a wake—flashing red from\nreflected lightning above. He came in at a Focused One. The creature\nglanced at him at the last second, and took a Shardspear in the face.\nSigzil’s momentum drove the weapon all the way in, the spearhead\nbursting out the rear. Sigzil towed the figure—heavy though it was—down\nto the ground and slammed the head into the stones. The Fused inflated in a\nheartbeat, tension releasing as it expanded in a sudden dangerous burst.\nLike hundreds of very taut ropes suddenly snapping and whipping about.\nThe eyes burned.\n“They can be killed!” Sigzil shouted, yanking the spear out and holding\nit overhead. “Fight! Keep fighting!”\nThat rallied them, and along with the Stormwall, they began pushing the\nenemy back. Soon Sigzil was able to pull free—leaving the Stormwall and\nSkar in command of ground and air respectively—and tapped his gemstone\nto indicate to Leyten he was ready for the message. The pattern of blinks\nthat followed spelled out the number of a plateau, and a warning that\nsomething strange was happening.\n“Weiss and Atakin,” Sigzil said to his squires. “You’re with me. Fishev,\nlet me know via ruby if the battle turns against us here. I need to check on\nsomething.”\n“Why is everybody so sad?” Gav asked the gathered crowd of future\nHeralds. “Can we pretend to be chasmfiends instead of standing around like\nthis?”\nDalinar cringed, waiting for the others to react. They all looked at Gav,\nas if seeing him for the first time. “Spren?” Jezrien finally asked. “What did\nyou … ask?”\n“The spren asked why we are sad,” Dalinar said. “It is an emotion spren,\nof course.”\n“Yes,” Jezrien said, the vision adapting to the situation. “We are sad, as"

Vedel\nwas visiting us when the … end began.”\n“So I left them,” she whispered. “To burn.”\n“You are a healer, Vedel, not a Firesmith,” Jezrien said, walking across\nthe tent to comfort her. “There was nothing you could do once the chain\nreaction set the air ablaze.”\n“Still … I should have been with them.” She looked away, and Dalinar\nfound something familiar to her mannerisms.\n“We all regret those days,” Jezrien said. “There’s a reason you came to\nme. You knew, even then, that we’d chosen the wrong god.”\n“I didn’t want to choose any god,” she said, then turned and gestured to\nthe side. “I suppose this one is happy. That we must finally come crawling\nto him.”\nLight filled the tent, blinding Dalinar. He blinked tears away as others\ngasped. A moment later that light faded, and a man was standing beside\nVedel. A regal, muscular man with long white hair, dark skin, and golden\nclothing from another time or place—far too fine for this era of the world.\nIt was Tanavast, the one they called the Almighty. Or as often, the one\ncalled Honor. It was happening. Please, Dalinar prayed, let me get a Blade\nas an anchor—before the vision ends.\nIt had to be close. But …\nWhat about Taln?\nAdolin charged into his armor, eager to be into the dome to join the defense.\nHe leaped into the boots and felt them tighten as he walked into the greaves\nthat were being held for him. His armorers cried out, as normally a\nShardbearer stood still and let himself be equipped.\nToday Adolin grabbed the breastplate—which had to be held by several\narmorers struggling with its weight—and guided it on, feeling it lock\naround him as two other armorers heaved the back plate on. The shoulder\nplates seemed to jump into place, as did other pieces, before he pushed his\nhands into the gauntlets. He turned and pointed at his scribes even as the\nfull power of the armor arrived, the pieces doing their final fitting, straps\npulling tight, clinking as sections snapped together and drew Stormlight\nfrom the chest.\n“Where is the Azish Shardbearer?” Adolin asked.\n“Northern section,” Kaminah said, scrambling up. “Um, the\ncommandant has a note for you here. It says, ‘Cast the Banner?’ With a\nquestion mark?”\n“Ah …” Adolin said. Towers maneuver. Kushkam thought from the\nenemy positioning that they’d try extra hard to bring down a Shardbearer\ntoday—which made sense. The enemy had largely stopped trying since\ntheir attempt on the first day. Perhaps they’d been waiting for the defenders\nto grow lax, and overcommit their Shards?\n“Tell him I appreciate the warning,” Adolin said. “And write ‘Arms\nAloft.’” A game signal, turning one of your cards to an angle to indicate\nbeing impressed by an opponent’s move."

Somehow, every time Adolin went into the dome,\nhe found Hmask on his honor guard. He still wasn’t certain what he’d done\nto get the fellow’s loyalty. He needed to find a translator and ask.\nHis guards in tow, Adolin entered the dome through one of the stone\ncorridors, then emerged into the darkened interior, struck by the smell of\nblood. It lingered here, cooped up as they were in this strange arena. The\nsingers left their fallen corpses—a tradition the Fused apparently enforced.\nThe defenders removed theirs during lulls—and they often cleared out the\nenemy bodies too, to avoid collecting rotspren. But storms, he wished he\ncould fight in the sunlight again.\nNo, he thought, jogging up behind their lines. When I fight in sunlight\nagain, it will be because the enemy has escaped this prison. Don’t wish for\nthat.\nThe enemy had further expanded their central fortification in the dome,\ncreating space for hundreds of soldiers. He wished he had some way of\nknowing what the food and resupply situation was for them in Shadesmar.\nThey hadn’t expected a long fight. Dared he hope they’d start starving?\nThinking about Shadesmar made him think of Maya. He could feel her,\nweakly, somewhere distant. Determined. But the enemy was well into its\npush trying to break the ring of defenders—who managed to field a full four\nranks. One shield wall, three lines of pikes, two resting while the two at the\nfront fought. Ten minutes at the front, ten on the pikes behind, followed by\ntwenty minutes of rest.\nAdolin picked a spot where the soldiers seemed to be flagging, then\nwaded in, sweeping with his large Shardhammer and breaking the enemy\nassault. Once he’d forced them back in that spot, he retreated and let the\nline reset itself with fresh troops, before prowling for another spot to help.\nHe was joined today by a few Azish field officers. As a runner came with\nwarnings of direforms approaching, he went charging off again. Here he\nhad a tougher fight, leaping in past beleaguered pikemen. He swung for a\nmostly white singer direform—with wicked carapace spines—but missed.\nSome furious fighting ensued, and he managed to drop one, though three\ncontinued to harry him. Worse, farther down the line, lightning showed\nRegals breaking apart the shield formation.\nAdolin grunted, but held his ground as arrows fell around him. May\nconcentrated volleys right on his position, counting on his armor to deflect\narrows, which banged as they occasionally struck him. That distraction let\nhim land a powerful blow on one direform—flinging the Regal tens of feet.\nThe other two fell back, which let Adolin charge to the second broken\nsection of the line in time to chase away the stormforms."

He was shorter, with a skin tone that bespoke some Reshi or\nHerdazian heritage. “I worry that battlefields are changing on us,\nBrightlord. Pike blocks aren’t working like they used to—they break too\neasily before these new kinds of troops. The old ways are dying. That\nworries me. All our training is in those methods.”\nThere wasn’t time to reminisce about the changing world with Gamma,\nas Adolin was immediately needed to shore up another position. The enemy,\nhowever, used a common tactic: When a Shardbearer showed up to help a\nline, the singers would largely fall back in that region. Avoiding the worst\nof the casualties he could inflict.\nIt made for grueling work. Adolin always needed to be ready, constantly\njumping in. Yet he never truly felt like he was achieving anything, for the\nenemy would reshuffle forces and attack where he wasn’t. Neziham—the\nAzish Shardbearer—largely had the same duty on the other half of the\ncircle.\nIt’s working though, Adolin thought as he spelled off another group of\nbeleaguered soldiers. They cheered him softly as his arrival let them fall\nback and swap with reserves. This method of defense had kept things\nmostly stable for the last day or two of fighting—and even though his\nsoldiers were tiring, he believed they could persist.\nThe latest reports said the Azish and Alethi reinforcements were under\ntwo days away. No more phantom attacks by that mystery army. With their\nVoidspren to give intel, the enemy had to know the same thing—and would\nbe worried about the tide changing when those armies arrived. So as he\nworked, Adolin looked for signs of what Kushkam was wary of: an attack\nintended to bring Adolin down.\nHis next few engagements didn’t involve any Regals or Fused. They\nwere holding back their elites for a spell, resting them. Plus, the enemy\nwaves withdrew quickly when he arrived, as if to heighten his confidence\nthat he was invulnerable. His instincts said Kushkam was right. The battle\nhad been stale for too long, almost a full day. They’d try for his Shards\nsoon.\nHe fell back and explained this to his honor guard, telling them what to\nexpect. So everyone was ready when—roughly two hours into this assault\n—Adolin stepped up past the line and the enemy suddenly surged forward.\nDireforms—a good two dozen of them—swarmed around, while\nconventional troops and stormforms tried to break the pike wall behind and\nsurround him.\nAdolin did not retreat. This was why he was here. He began swinging,\nsmashing enemy after enemy as they were forced to engage him—and take\nthe true beating he could inflict. He used Mountainstance, one of the\nstances for the hammer, and trusted his team to keep him from being\noverwhelmed.\nThen went on the attack."

He used Mountainstance, one of the\nstances for the hammer, and trusted his team to keep him from being\noverwhelmed.\nThen went on the attack.\nThe enemy seemed surprised by this, and he heard what sounded like\ncurses as he laid about himself with the hammer, cracking carapace,\ncrushing stormforms who got too close, their lightning spasming out.\nRegals didn’t really have a counterpart in the human military. Unmade were\nlike Heralds, and Fused like Radiants. The Regals were perhaps special\nforces—but enhanced ones.\nThe direforms around him—with extremely strong carapace grown in\nwicked points—pressed in. They didn’t have Surges, but they were tough.\nAt least until you hit them full in the face with a Shardhammer, their\nexaggerated carapace crumpling as they fell in a mess of blood. They were\naccustomed to being stronger than both allies and foes, and would have\ndominated an ordinary battlefield. But with his Plate, Adolin matched them\nand held his ground, until …\n“Adolin,” a voice said. He knew that voice. Masculine, clipped,\nreserved. Was that one of his honor guard? “Adolin, the other one is falling!\nHe’s down!”\n“Other one?” he shouted.\n“The Azish Shardbearer. They sent twice as many against him—and they\nhave shields with aluminum bands to stop the Blade.”\nStorms. They weren’t trying to bring Adolin down, they were trying to\ndistract him. The true attack was on Neziham, who was already down—and\non the complete opposite side of the dome from Adolin. Storms!\nAdolin tried to withdraw, but the enemy had planned this. They’d\npositioned direforms along his flanks, making it difficult for him to extract.\nThey would force him to fight for every inch of retreat. In the meantime\nthey’d be finishing off Neziham and pulling away his corpse, armor and all.\nThe two Shardbearers were the defenders’ best edge in this fight. Lose\none …\nAdolin made a snap decision.\nA potentially terrible one.\nHe charged.\nThe enemy had positioned all their troops to his flanks, pushing the\nhonor guard behind him into a snarl of fighting. They’d done everything\nthey could to keep him from retreating, but they’d left the way forward\nlargely open. Adolin raced on Plate-enhanced feet, broke through the flimsy\nenemy back line, and dashed across the open field. Virtually alone, trailing\na few of his honor guard, he soon reached the enemy bunker.\n“Quickly. He’s still alive, I think.” Suddenly the voice clicked.\n“Notum?” Adolin said.\nA glowing figure appeared in the air by Adolin, roughly a foot tall—\nbearing the distinctive beard and uniform of the honorspren naval captain.\n“It worked!” Adolin said. “Where is Maya?”\n“I don’t know that. Perhaps I should explain after?”\nRight. Adolin’s brash push forward had put him in the middle of the\nenemy position, surrounded in a way that was terrible even for a\nShardbearer. This was how you fell. This was how, no matter how\ninvincible you felt, you could be brought down—letting your Shards"

This was how, no matter how\ninvincible you felt, you could be brought down—letting your Shards\nbecome enemy Shards, then return to kill your friends.\nThe thing was, Adolin wasn’t just any Shardbearer. He was, at his core,\nthe Blackthorn’s son. Sadeas, wherever he was, could explain what that\nmeant.\nAdolin didn’t like it, and he didn’t have to. He embraced it anyway.\nMomentum, he thought. A battle is about momentum.\nOnly one way forward.\nThrough the enemy fortification itself, which now had a dome on the top\nto deflect falling stones. It was dented, but sloped; he wouldn’t be able to\nget any purchase up there. So he kept going forward, enemies swarming at\nhis sides but shouting to one another in alarm. As long as the enemy was\nconfused by his insane gamble, as long as they were afraid of him, they\nwouldn’t press their advantage. Adolin bashed open the enemy fortification\nwith his hammer, beating back the bronze door and smashing it completely.\nUnfortunately, that left his hammer—already weakened from fighting—\nbent all out of shape. So Adolin threw it into the singers within, crushing\nseveral of them.\nThe space was big enough for a direform, which meant it was big\nenough for him. He bellowed a roar at the remaining singers crowded inside\n—causing them to panic and dodge, trailing fearspren.\nAdolin charged into the dim confines.\nDon’t stop moving.\nDon’t let them respond; only let them react. Don’t let them plan, only let\nthem panic. Don’t let them see you as anything other than a terrible force.\nMake them avoid you at all costs.\nHe began laying into the singers inside with his fists. He crushed skulls\nand sent bodies slamming into stiff bronze walls. Their terror did the work\nfor him as they scrambled to get away, tripping one another, clearing the\npath. He had to climb over bodies both alive and dead, but with the\nunnatural strength and poise of his armor he had little trouble.\nDon’t. Stop. Moving.\nHe didn’t go through the control building at the center, but rounded it to\nthe left, then crashed out through a door on the opposite side of the enemy\nfortification, where singers were spilling out before him, desperate to get\naway. He’d traveled faster than news of what he was doing, so the rear\nranks on this side were confused. He roared and surged among them, and\nthe chaos fed itself.\nNotum became a glowing line of light in the air, circling over one area in\nthe battle ahead. With that guide, Adolin was able to storm among the\nenemy ranks and break through to find the fallen Shardbearer on his back,\nhis armor smoking from a dozen cracks. Neziham was still fighting while\nsupine, sweeping about with his Blade to cut at the legs of any who came\nclose.\nDireforms, however, leaped over the sword and came at him from all\nsides.

        "text": "Direforms, however, leaped over the sword and came at him from all\nsides. Others blocked Neziham’s attacks with those wide square shields that\nhad bands of aluminum nailed onto them. One direform pounded a fist into\nNeziham’s head, and the helmet exploded in a spray of molten sparks.\nThe next hit would finish him off.\nAdolin didn’t intend to let that blow fall. He roared again, drawing their\nattention, and was rewarded by looks of confusion, shock, and—most\nimportantly—terror. Adolin grabbed the nearest direform and smashed a fist\nthrough the malen’s face, breaking carapace, then flesh, then bone. As the\ncorpse sagged in his hands, Adolin took it by one leg and began swinging.\nIt was difficult to find weapons a Shardbearer wouldn’t break within one\nor two swings. Even the best swords shattered when you hit someone with\nthem using the full force of Plate—but direforms had extremely strong\ncarapace. Adolin made full use of this, swinging his grisly trophy around,\nbashing it into the others, shocking them with the brutality of it.\nAs the body ripped apart, leaving him brandishing a leg, Adolin at last\nachieved his goal. The demoralized and confused enemy broke, Regals\nincluded. Most battles weren’t about killing everyone who stood against\nyou; they were instead about getting your enemy to stop fighting.\nRegals sprinted for their bunker. They dragged wounded friends, and\nAdolin raised a hand, signaling to the archers to let them do so. Exhausted,\nhe turned to help the fallen Neziham—but halted when he saw one figure\non the field who was not retreating.\nThe Heavenly One glowed—if it could be called that—with the dark\nenergy of Voidlight, but did not fly. Abidi the Monarch. He glanced at his\nretreating soldiers, then back at Adolin.\n“I see you,” he said. “Radiant. Why do you hide your powers?”\n“I’m not Radiant,” Adolin said.\n“Nonsense. That spren is yours. I see its influence, when it tries to hide.\nLittle honorspren, flitting around in the air.” He stepped toward Adolin. “No\nwonder you could stand against me as no common mortal could, Kholin.”\nAdolin growled, stepping back.\n“Yes,” Abidi said, “I know you. They say you’re the best. Did you know\nthat the blood of Radiants quiets the voices in my mind, and takes away the\nedge of a thousand years of pain? If I bathe in it, they simmer, then slip\naway. Now that I know what you are, I can claim your corpse as my prize,\nand this city as my throne.”\n“Then come for me,” Adolin said, raising metal fists.\nInstead, Abidi studied him before finally joining the retreating armies.\nThe wiser move, for he was now the one in danger of being surrounded.\nSome might have called it cowardice, but they would be fools.\nAdolin sighed and walked over to offer Neziham a hand, helping heave\nthe fallen Shardbearer into a sitting position. He was heavy; the enemy had\nalmost run him out of Stormlight.\n“Thank you,” he said. “You … are quite the Shardbearer.”\n“Thanks,” Adolin said."

Do you suppose\nit was the secret of half-shards all along? Our artifabrians never were able to\nsuccessfully reproduce them from those schematics King Taravangian\nprovided. Was it a trick, from the Vedens, all this time?”\n“I wonder,” Adolin said, watching as the enemy retreated with their\nshields. The metal could block Shardblades, and though it was\nexceptionally rare, the enemy seemed to be able to Soulcast it. It was\nshowing up more and more in battle.\nAdolin turned, then—with a start—realized a uniformed man with\ndrooping white eyebrows peeking from his helmet was standing guard at his\nrear. “Hmask?” Adolin demanded. “Did you follow me into the storming\nenemy fortification?”\nWith a grin, Hmask saluted.\n“Suppose I can’t chastise you for doing what you saw me do,” Adolin\ngrumbled, looking around. He found Notum floating nearby. “All right,\nspren. Let’s chat.”\nAll I will say is that I have kept my bargain, and I did not go in\nperson at her request for aid.\nNavani—seen by the others in this vision as Wit—felt her fingers tighten on\nGav’s shoulders as he stood before her.\nGod had just appeared.\nThis was … Him. The being she’d worshipped since childhood. The one\nshe’d burned glyphwards to. Dalinar said he was dead, but she’d never been\nable to accept that, not the way he said it. God could not die. Perhaps an\naspect of him could die, an avatar.\nSo, she steeled herself. This wasn’t actually God. This was one of his\nmany faces.\n“My friends,” Tanavast said.\n“Friends?” Ishar said softly. “You call us that?”\n“We should have been friends, Ishar,” Tanavast said. “You should have\nlistened to me so many years ago.”\n“You brought war and death to our world,” Chana said.\n“I brought truth, and the truth brought war and death,” Tanavast replied.\n“Do you deny this, Chana?”\nChana fell silent.\n“Rayse would destroy you now,” Tanavast said. “He doesn’t care for the\npeople he plays with; he never has. He has found the singers, and he’s been\ngranting them immortality so they can kill you.” Tanavast’s eyes flashed\ngolden. “You will not defeat him. Not alone.”\n“Honor,” Nale said, shoving his way to the front of the group, “how do\nwe know this won’t play out as it did last time?”\n“Nale,” Tanavast said. “It is good to see you. Tell the others. Did I lie to\nyou last time?”\n“No,” Nale said. “But the powers you gave me … they helped burn the\nworld itself.”\nHonor’s expression softened. “I’m sorry. But did I warn you?”\n“Yes,” Nale admitted. “You did.”\n“It will not happen again, Nale,” Honor said. “Ishar’s plan is a good\none.”"

You\nquestion him—therefore he will now seek to annihilate you.”\nNavani soaked it in, too amazed to talk. This was a scholar’s dream.\nEven though she wasn’t a historian, this had to be witnessed, so it could be\nrecorded. She practically held her breath, worried that any interruption or\ncomment she made could taint the vision.\n“I don’t know if I can trust you again, Honor,” Nale said.\nTanavast stepped forward and placed his hand on Nale’s shoulder.\nNavani felt the hair on her arms go up, her skin tingling.\n“I,” Tanavast said, “am not perfect, Nale. I am merely a part of\nsomething that is perfect. I took this power upon myself to do good, and I\nmean to keep that Intent. I promise that I will not allow what happened to\nyour ancestral home to happen here. However, you do need power to\nresist.”\n“We can bind the enemy to a place far from here,” Ishar said. “Their\nsouls keep returning, and that is something we can never defeat.”\n“It is why they keep fighting,” Vedel said a moment later, looking up\nfrom the edge of the conversation. “Instead of finding a peaceful solution. If\nwe can lock these Fused away, then perhaps we can persuade the living to\nlisten.”\n“A … binding,” Chana said. “What kind of binding?”\nNavani trembled. She’d always imagined this happening in some grand\nhall or magnificent palace. In a temple or shrine. Not in an old leather tent,\nwith rain pattering outside. She’d imagined regal clothing, not furs and\nrough cloth. Shining armor, not stone spears.\nBut it was happening. And she got to witness it.\n“Most of you once served him,” Tanavast said. “He granted you his\npowers. There is a Connection we can exploit, so long as the circle contains\nenough of you. Strongest would be sixteen or my own number of ten—it\ncannot be nine. If you speak oaths to me, my power can be channeled and\ngoverned by rules to prevent a cataclysm. I will take back your Surges, then\ngrant them anew, and together you will become a force that both protects\nRoshar and binds the enemy away from it.”\n“Ten,” Shalash said. “But we are only nine …”\n“No, Ash,” Jezrien said, turning toward her immediately. “There will be\nenough without you. We will find two more. We …” He trailed off as she\nmet his eyes, and Navani sensed a history there. Things that had happened\nin the decades since Ash had removed her ribbon.\nJezrien sighed. “We will accept … any who volunteer.”\n“Only volunteers,” Honor agreed. “This may well require you to travel\nto Braize, and its well of souls, to seal the enemy. Your pact will complete\nthe blessing that Odium began, then rejected—but you will become mine\ninstead of his.”\nNavani didn’t know if the others felt the same trembling that she did—"

Let me begin the\ncircle, and you end it. It is my duty, as king.”\nIshar nodded. He closed his eyes, and a web of lines emanated from him,\nlike the Bondsmithing she and Dalinar had begun to perform. This seemed\nfar more intricate, and she realized she could never have replicated this with\nher childlike understanding of the power. Ishar mouthed words of Intent,\nthen touched Honor and drew out a powerful cord of light.\n“This will start the bond,” Ishar said. “Only once it is complete can\nVedel seal immortality upon us—using our Connection to Honor to tap into\nconstantly rejuvenating Investiture from the Spiritual Realm, locking our\nsouls at our current age. This way we can be reborn again and again.”\nIshar touched his line to Jezrien first. “I swear this oath to you, Honor,”\nthe king said. “I will hold back the darkness. I will protect this land.”\nThe cord of light went through Jezrien, and he began to glow. A low hum\nof power filled the room, vibrating with Honor’s tone. Ishar took a second\ncord from the god, and glanced around the room.\nJezrien took something from his pocket and held it out. A small round\npiece of stone—the same one that Dalinar had taken as an anchor. “I release\nyour debt, Nale. I will not force this upon you.”\n“I appreciate that,” Nale said. “I am uncertain I desire it, but I will take\nthis charge with honor.”\n“Do not consider it an honor,” Jezrien said. “A duty, yes, but not an\nhonor.”\n“I understand.” Nale hesitated, looking at Ishar holding a line of light,\nConnected to a god. “Though I had not expected you would come to an\nenemy with this offer.”\n“An enemy, yes,” Jezrien said. “But an enemy who was correct all along,\nmaking me the villain, not you. We will fix what we’ve broken. Ishar and I\nagreed. There is no person we would welcome more eagerly into this pact\nthan you. You are the single most honorable man I have ever had the\nprivilege of opposing.”\n“I wish that were true,” Nale said, watching that line of light. “But I will\nserve as best I can. I swear this oath, Almighty Honor. I will protect this\npeople and this land. I will hold back the darkness.”\n“And I will watch both of you,” Chana said, stepping forward. “Where\nmy king goes, I go. I will protect the people and this land, Honor.

I will\nhold back the darkness.”\nIshar Connected them both with lines of light, the hum of power\nincreasing with each one. Navani watched with a held breath. This was not\nthe way she had pictured it, but storms, it was beautiful. People Connected\ndirectly to God, bound to him, oathed to him. This was the very beginning\nof Vorinism.\nVedel was next, then Pralla. Before Battar could speak, Shalash stepped\nforward. Jezrien raised his hand, as if to ward her off again—then instead\noffered it to her. She took it, made her oath, and received a line of light.\nBattar was next.\nThen nothing. Six and seven … who is the eighth?\nOh, right. She nudged Dalinar.\n“Navani,” he whispered, “this can be our anchor. If I get an Honorblade\nhere …” He took a deep breath. “Blood of my fathers, if this isn’t the\nopportunity of a lifetime …” He stepped to the group, which was forming\ninto a circle. “I swear to Honor to protect this land. To hold back the\ndarkness. I will do it. Somehow.”\nIshar Connected him, but remained outside the circle, as Jezrien had\nsuggested he be last. There was still one missing.\n“We eight who have sworn,” Jezrien said, “all remember the old world.\nBut there is one more here who knew the gods. Midius? It is time.”\nGod himself turned to Navani. “I would have you, old friend. I think\nyou’re the only one among us all who showed an ounce of wisdom on that\nday.”\nShe wanted to. But …\nWit would say no. He’d say it in a silly way.\nFacing God, she tried to impersonate Wit, but she couldn’t bring herself\nto speak an insult. “I can’t, I really can’t,” she whispered, holding in tears.\n“Pick another.”\nJezrien looked disappointed and turned away, as if he’d truly thought in\nthe moment that Wit would join them.\n“It must be a volunteer,” Tanavast said. “And to create the bond, it is\nbetter if it is someone who has interacted with the gods in the past.”\nNone of those watching said anything. Until at last Nale took from\nJezrien the disc with the marking on it. “It cannot be only kings and\nscholars, can it?” he said. “What finely dressed, immortal demigod will\nspare one thought for the woman whose name he does not know?”\nHe flipped the disc over in his fingers. “I have a recommendation.”\nKaladin strolled through a highstorm like it was nothing. In fact, there was\nbarely anything to distinguish it from the rain showers he and Szeth had\nencountered a few days before. Same darkened sky, as if it were brooding.\nSame lazy rain, chill but not cold. Same odd sounds: water on grass and\nsoil. He was accustomed to the rapping of rain on stone, a sound not unlike\ntwigs cracking. In Shinovar, rain fell with a sputter and a tap, more center\ndrum than rim."

In Shinovar, rain fell with a sputter and a tap, more center\ndrum than rim.\nHe and Szeth hiked toward the next monastery, waiting for the storm to\nrecharge their gemstones. He’d thrown on the cloak Dalinar had given him,\nand found that Leyten had properly oiled it against rain. With his boots\nlaced tight and his hood up, he kept relatively dry. It wasn’t pleasant,\nparticularly not with the way the ground melted here when exposed to\nwater, but neither was it arduous.\nStrolling. Through a highstorm, his armor spren dancing in the air\ncurrents above. He thought maybe he understood one of Wit’s old stories\nbetter. Naturally this was the place where, after running across an entire\ncontinent, a man could at last find the wind faltering. Of course Fleet had\nfailed in the end, but that hadn’t been the point.\n“Hey, Szeth,” Kaladin said, hurrying up beside him—slipping only twice\nin the mud. “You know the story of Fleet?”\n“No,” Szeth said softly.\n“It’s … I guess it’s not relevant.” If Szeth had one talent, it was\ncontinuing on despite adversity. He didn’t need reminders of that. But …\n“Want to hear it anyway?”\nSzeth didn’t reply. He often did that, ignorant or uncaring of social\ncustoms. Kaladin clenched his jaw, trying not to feel annoyed. Kaladin had\nthought he was making some progress with Szeth, but then last night Szeth\nhad apparently fallen into Shadesmar, fought two Honorbearers, and\nreturned. Despite Kaladin’s prodding, Szeth had barely said five sentences\nabout it.\nSzeth wasn’t opening up to him, no matter what he did. The man had\neven stopped telling the story of his younger life. Kaladin felt so awkward\npushing for more—he really was muddling through things he barely\nunderstood, wasn’t he? He looked up at the sky, almost offended by how\nmuch light shone through those clouds even while it was raining. Why\nshould the people here get to live in such relative ease? What did Szeth\npossibly have to complain about, growing up in such an idyllic place? Why\nwas …\nNo. Kaladin forcibly pushed back on those dark thoughts. This quiet\nstorm reminded him of the Weeping, when he always had a rougher time.\nKaladin smiled and remembered lying on a rooftop once in the rain, when\nTien—with his boundless optimism and love—had shown up with a toy\nhorse for his big brother. That memory could make him smile now, when\nonce it had only reminded him of Tien’s death.\nThe people of Shinovar shouldn’t feel bad because the storms aren’t\nstrong here, he told himself. Everyone’s challenges are different.\nKaladin took a deep breath. “Hey. Why are we heading to the Elsecaller\nmonastery? We have the sword, and the Honorbearer is dead. Shouldn’t we\njust move on?”\n“We must check,” Szeth said, his eyes forward, “to make certain the\npeople are released when their Honorbearer dies. It happened once. I want\nto confirm that it continues to happen.”\nIt was a fair enough reason."

Then felt a fool. “I’m glad you’re trying them.”\n“I assumed you would be.”\n“Do understand,” Kaladin said, “it … it’s not an easy fix. You have to\npractice it day after day, even when your mind doesn’t want to. Especially\nwhen it feels like it’s too hard. Learning to resist your own mind is difficult,\nSzeth.”\n“Yes, I see,” Szeth said. “I will consider.”\n“We’re a lot alike, you know,” Kaladin said.\n“We are?”\n“Left our homes as youths to become soldiers,” Kaladin said. “Ended up\nfighting battles we didn’t believe in, because of our foolish choices. I see\nmyself in you, Szeth.”\n“I cannot say the same,” Szeth replied. “I do my job. You always seem to\nbe questioning yours. I find that aspect of you embarrassing.”\nKaladin dented his palms with his fingernails as he made fists, forcing\nhimself not to snap at the man.\nAnd as if in reward for Kaladin’s self-control, Szeth continued a moment\nlater. “However, I now see reason in Dalinar sending you with me. Your\nwords … have merit. For the first time in quite a while I find myself\nwavering. Perhaps you will be victorious here, Kaladin Stormblessed, and I\nwill take your words as law.”\n“Wait … as law?”\n“Yes,” Szeth said, soaring smoothly over a large puddle, landing on the\nother side. “Dalinar does not want my devotion. I believe I can change my\nguide and still remain true to my Skybreaker oaths. I have been considering\nfollowing the law as the others do. Perhaps instead I could do as you say.”\nKaladin groaned. “Szeth, I’m not trying to get you to follow me instead\nof Dalinar.”\n“Ah, you aren’t?” Szeth said, glancing to the side. “I misunderstand,\nthen. You have been doing a poor job of making your intentions clear.”\n“I want you to follow your own conscience!”\n“My own conscience says I cannot trust my own conscience,” Szeth\nsaid, perfectly straight-faced.\n“What you do instead isn’t healthy.”\n“My health is irrelevant.” He regarded Kaladin again, then smiled. “Do\nnot look so displeased. Your way of thinking does help. It has led me to a\nposition of leverage over my own will. Because of you, Kaladin, I am\nfinally able to recognize—and admit—that it is time for me to die. I’m at\nlast capable of the strength required to kill myself.”\nKaladin stopped in place, rain tapping at the oiled hood of his cloak.\n“You what?”\n“The law demands that I, for my crimes, be punished,” Szeth said,\ncontinuing to walk. “I have killed many; I should face justice. I will\ncomplete the pilgrimage, cleanse my homeland, then find peace in\ndestruction at my own hand. Now that I know I’m not Truthless, I can"

Now that I know I’m not Truthless, I can\ndeliver judgment to myself.” He looked back. “I used to pray the spren\nwould strengthen the hands of those who struck at me. Silly, isn’t it? When\nthe rock was always just a rock, and I could have ended my own suffering\nat any point.” He shrugged, then turned and continued along the rainy path.\n“Szeth!” Kaladin shouted. “That isn’t why I’ve been teaching you!”\n“Do you want me to make my own decisions?” Szeth called back.\n“Yes, but—”\n“This is mine, bridgeman! Come, let’s hurry. For once my fate seems\ncertain, and I find that invigorating.”\nKaladin lingered, feeling like the rain was knocking and trying to get in.\nTo tell him what a fool he had been.\nSyl zipped down and appeared next to him. “So few spren, even in a\nstorm,” she said, looking skyward. “Just your armor spren—not another\nsingle windspren. Something’s happening. The Wind says … says the storm\nis wavering.”\nKaladin heaved himself forward, pulling his cloak closer. “Did you hear\nwhat he said?”\n“Szeth?” she said, joining him and stepping lightly—although full sized,\nshe floated and danced more than walked. “Yes.”\n“I thought I was making progress.”\n“It’s merely progress with a few … twists and turns.”\nKaladin shook his head, rain streaming down his shoulders. “Why do I\nfind him so infuriating, Syl? Shouldn’t I enjoy helping him? Part of me\nwants to let him end himself. He’s right—he does deserve to die, doesn’t\nhe?”\n“I don’t know,” she said softly. “Does anyone?”\n“He’s killed hundreds.”\n“Under orders. As have we.”\n“A soldier bears some weight of responsibility for the people they kill,”\nKaladin said. “We all know that, deep down.”\n“So …”\n“So, storms, I don’t know,” Kaladin said. “Part of me feels like he’s a\nlost cause, Syl. He doesn’t want my help. I should leave him alone and\nfocus my attention on what the Wind needs me to do. Szeth is too far gone.”\n“People didn’t leave you alone when you thought you were too far\ngone.”\nHe didn’t reply to that. Because she was right, yes, but this was also\ndifferent. Szeth was …\nWell, Kaladin couldn’t even really define it. Szeth was just so … so …\nunhelpable.\nHe felt unsatisfied with those thoughts, but he persisted in them,\nbelligerent as he stalked through the rain. They passed a single rainspren—\none—which Szeth knelt by and bowed to, whispering, before they\ncontinued. Kaladin remained in his self-enforced sour mood for another\nhour of hiking, until something changed. He stood up straight, then reached\nto his pocket, finding light bursting from it. His gemstones had been\nrecharged. Just like that?\nSon of … Honor … A distant voice, accompanying a rumble of thunder\nwith no lightning.\n“What?” Kaladin whispered."

Just like that?\nSon of … Honor … A distant voice, accompanying a rumble of thunder\nwith no lightning.\n“What?” Kaladin whispered.\nWhen there was no response, he glanced at Syl. She shook her head. “I\ntold you. Something’s been … strange about Father lately. He’s …\nwithdrawn from me, Kaladin.”\n“Do you have any idea why?”\n“No. And I can’t get the Wind to say much. She seems weaker today.\nWhatever is happening, I don’t think it can be good.”\n“We’ll see if Wit has any news for us,” Kaladin said, “when we report in\ntonight.”\nShe nodded and floated on ahead. Kaladin, for now, didn’t try further\nwith Szeth—because he knew that the wrong words could be dangerous.\nBetter to think about a plan first so he didn’t cause additional problems.\nSzeth had halted atop a hill in the rain, and as Kaladin joined him, the\nreason became obvious. They’d arrived. The next monastery was straight\nahead. In the middle of a river.\n“Ten. But we are only nine …” Shalash said, as part of the conversation\nwith the Almighty. Renarin wouldn’t have noticed anything wrong, except\nsuddenly Glys spoke.\nThere! the spren said. There, that’s one of them! Shalash didn’t say that\nduring the actual event!\nRenarin froze, then cursed himself for doing so. He forced himself to\nlook away and meet Rlain’s eyes. He nodded, as Tumi had shared their\ntechnique for spotting intruders. Shalash’s line had been out of place. She\nwas either Shallan or one of the assassins.\nUm … Renarin thought, now what?\nRlain was already moving though. Both of them had trained with\nKaladin, but Rlain had taken to the training far more fully—despite at first\npretending not to know much. He had the experience of both the Alethi and\nthe listener armies. Would that be enough against Shallan’s assassins?\nRenarin tried to stay near enough to Rlain to help without looking\nsuspicious. Everyone else was focused on the conversation with Honor.\nThen he met Shalash’s eyes by accident. They locked gazes—and she\nwhispered, barely audible, “Renarin?”\nStorms. It was Shallan.\nGlys, tell Rlain, Renarin sent as he nodded to Shallan.\nI will do so, Glys said. But you must speak very soon. Then Shallan must\ntoo, and Pattern does not yet know how to communicate mind-to-mind!\nOrdinary Radiant spren have trouble with this, as Honor considered it an\ninvasion of privacy. Perhaps he worried they would learn to hear his mind,\nas part of the bond. Regardless, Pattern cannot pass the correct words to\nShallan.\nThe others had begun to glow, swearing oaths, a humming power filling\nthe room. Renarin knew his aunt Navani would be quietly memorizing all\nof this. He could go to her for a thorough analysis after. For now he\nrepeated the words that Glys gave him, received Ishar’s line of light, then\nstepped up beside Shallan and whispered to her, hoping the hum would\ncover his whispers.\n“You’re going to be expected to say what Ash originally said,” Renarin"

Step forward—but wait for Jezrien to\ntake your hands. Then say the exact words the others have.”\nShe did that, playing the role well. Renarin counted off the people in the\nroom as Dalinar took the role of Kalak. So … he could assume the enemy\nwasn’t one of the Heralds, as none of them had spoken out of turn. That left\nonly a handful of guards standing at the back of the room. Careful not to\nmeet their eyes, Renarin whispered to Shallan.\n“I think your assassins must be those guards.”\n“That was my guess as well,” Shallan whispered, “once I realized you\nwere Vedel.”\n“What was my giveaway?” he asked.\n“You’re fidgeting with the ties on your dress.”\nStorms. He hadn’t even realized. He forcibly let go of them, feeling\nhimself blush at being so obvious.\n“It’s all right,” Shallan whispered. “It takes years of practice to expunge\nyour tells—unless you can fabricate an entirely new personality. Which I\ndon’t recommend.”\nRenarin relayed their suspicions to Rlain. The singer repositioned closer\nto those guards as Glys whispered to Renarin what was coming.\n“A large group of them are about to leave,” Renarin whispered to Shallan\nbeneath the hum of power, “to fetch Taln. The rest of us can stay here. Be\nready to move.”\nShe nodded, not acting the least bit worried, though it was nerve-racking\nto him. How did people live with this? The knowledge that in seconds, life\nand death would be decided? That in seconds someone he loved could be …\ngone? Decades of life learning, dreaming, preparing just … snuffed out?\nThe group began to leave, bowing to Honor as they exited. Those\nGhostbloods had been planning for this mission. Storms. What if their spren\nreally did know the script, as Glys had warned, and could therefore play any\npart perfectly? They could be anyone.\nThose soldiers at the back looked unconcerned. But wouldn’t you act\nunconcerned? Renarin wavered as the last people left the tent, leaving him,\nShallan, Rlain, and the three guards.\nRenarin took a deep breath and got ready to join Shallan in striking\nagainst the guards. As he did, Honor attacked him.\nThese days, it seems she and I are the only ones capable of\nmaintaining any manner of isolation. I can tell you, with absolute\ncertainty, she does not want to see you again. It has not been too\nlong. No, I do not think it ever will be.\nRadiant spun away from the confused guards as Renarin called out a\nwarning. Damnation. She hadn’t considered that Mraize might have taken\nthe form of Tanavast. Yet he—glowing, deific, with long white hair and\nstrange-fitting robes—pushed Renarin aside and pulled a knife from his\nbelt, lunging at her."

Yet he—glowing, deific, with long white hair and\nstrange-fitting robes—pushed Renarin aside and pulled a knife from his\nbelt, lunging at her.\nGuards scattered, confused, running from the tent as they saw a god\nstrike murderously at one of the Heralds. Radiant leaped back as Mraize\nswiped, then she slashed with her own knife—the one that warped the air—\nforcing him back. She had training in knives, although Adolin disliked\nthem.\nIt’s hard to not lose a knife fight, even if you win, she remembered him\ntelling her. Most of the blocks involve sacrificing a limb to put your knife in\nthe other fellow’s eye.\nYet she felt alive with Stormlight urging her forward. She slashed three\ntimes at Mraize. Now that he’d dropped the act, she could see his smile on\nthe god’s features. He expertly dodged Rlain, who came in for a tackle, then\ncasually shoved Renarin out of the way.\nRlain recovered, grabbing a spear from the last remaining guard—who\nstood frozen with fear. Renarin went tumbling. Rlain fell in beside her,\nspear at the ready, as they faced Mraize, whose robes shone with an inner\nlight. He stepped back, knife in a reverse grip, his stance threatening.\n“Watch for Iyatil,” Radiant whispered. “That final guard might be her.”\n“They let me take the spear,” Rlain whispered back.\n“Iyatil might do that,” Radiant said, “if she thought it would put you off\nguard. I’m not sure it’s her, but she’s here somewhere.”\nRlain hummed softly and repositioned so he could watch both Mraize\nand the panicked guard. “Warning. I’m in a human femalen’s body. I keep\nexpecting to be taller, my reach to go farther. I won’t be fighting in top\ncondition.”\nShe nodded and counted slowly, then together they rushed Mraize—who\nwhipped out a blowgun and planted a dart straight in Rlain’s eye. The singer\ncursed, stumbling, as Mraize shoved Radiant off balance.\nShe fell, then scrambled back up—but Mraize was calculating and quick.\nHe swiftly got his knife in Rlain’s throat and sent him toppling. Radiant\nstruck at Mraize from behind, but he danced away while Renarin grabbed\nRlain, crying out. He and Rlain fuzzed. A moment later the two Heralds\nthey’d been impersonating were staring with glassy expressions. Their\nspren must have pulled them out.\nMraize glanced at the others, momentarily distracted. As Adolin had\ntaught her, Radiant attacked him from the side. Shallan’s husband’s training\nproved correct: in a fight with multiple people, combatants would often\nexpose themselves to take out one enemy. She pressed that advantage, and\nas Mraize turned to defend, she took his knife straight through her forearm\n—then planted her knife square in his chest.\nThey both froze. Her arm blazed with a good kind of pain, the kind she\ncould easily ignore, the kind that sometimes just kept her alive and aware.\nMraize, in turn, smiled.\n“Well executed, little knife,” he said, blood trickling from the corner of"

He pulled back from her, stumbling,\nripping his knife from her arm—and leaving her knife in her hand. “But did\nyou expect that to kill me?”\nHer left arm flared with pain, and she had trouble working her fingers.\nNo, her strike hadn’t killed him—not even with the anti-Stormlight knife.\nLike when she’d taken the bolt to her side, anti-Stormlight didn’t\nautomatically kill a human. He’d have some of it moving through his veins\nfrom her strike, but it would only activate if he was foolish enough to heal\nbefore it evaporated.\nShe drew in a little Stormlight and let her arm begin to reknit. She didn’t\nwant to do too much, lest she attract Odium’s attention. Mraize leaned on\nthe table, coughing again, and she was reminded of a different kind of pain.\nA pain that she hated, the pain that she’d felt upon stabbing Tyn through the\nheart so long ago, at the start of her journey.\nShe advanced on Mraize. If she stabbed him enough times, he’d be\nforced to draw in Stormlight.\n“Do you even know?” he whispered through bloody lips. “What we’re\ndoing in here?”\nThe two Heralds lay on the floor dazed, eyes staring sightlessly, as did\nthe final guard. It was as if … this part of the vision had gone so far off-plan\nthat it was frozen.\n“You’re here,” Shallan said, “because you seek Mishram’s prison.”\n“Why, though?” Mraize asked. “You need to ask the difficult questions. I\ntrained you to consider not merely the prey, but the hunt.”\nShe halted, wary, watching blood trail down the side of a god’s mouth,\nthen drip from his chin. She launched herself at him, refusing to be\ndistracted, and he managed to catch her arm—barely. He put his face close\nto hers.\n“Why?” he asked. “You can figure it out. I know you can. Why? Why is\nMishram not already free?”\nThis stopped her. Despite it all, she paused. Trying to press her knife\ntoward his eye, held in place by his grip. Why wasn’t she free?\nThis is the realm of the gods, she thought. Where Odium resides. He\nknows precisely where her prison is. He could have led someone here to\nfree her.\nWhy hasn’t he?\n“Odium wants her imprisoned,” she whispered.\nMraize nodded.\n“He’s afraid of her, isn’t he?”\n“Yes,” Mraize said, smiling.\n“Why?”\n“I don’t know,” Mraize said. “But you learn to respect the thing the\ngreatest predator fears. Master Thaidakar is smart, little knife. Maybe the\nsmartest man I’ve ever met … or at least the most shrewd. He knows how\ndangerous Odium is, and is legitimately worried about him escaping. So,\nwhile the other Ghostbloods question, I hunt. Because I know.”\n“We need leverage against Odium,” Shallan said."

He, his regal clothing stained red,\nstumbled back and barely remained upright, one hand resting on the table\nfor strength.\nShe wanted to do as he said. She wanted to work with him.\nDo you need me again? Radiant asked.\nYes, Shallan said.\nWe need to talk about how you made me take over earlier, so you\nwouldn’t have to see—\nI’ll confront it soon, Shallan promised.\n“Help you?” Radiant demanded. “Mraize, I’m here to kill you.”\n“Ah, but I created you, little knife,” Mraize said, his words slightly\ngarbled from his punctured lung. “You cannot best your maker.” He winced.\n“You know how important our quest is. Let us put aside our differences and\nuse this weapon against your enemy.”\n“No, Mraize,” Radiant said. “I won’t be manipulated by you.”\n“I warn you,” he growled. “We know more than you think.”\n“And I know more than you think,” she said. “I know exactly why\nOdium is afraid.”\n“Why?” he said.\n“What happened to Adonalsium?” Radiant asked in turn. “The god that\nwas killed, all those millennia ago?”\n“He—or it—was murdered by common people.”\n“Common or extraordinary,” Shallan said, “the god of gods was killed\nby its own creations. Yes, I can guess why Odium fears Mishram.\nSometimes the parents’ greatest fear should be their children.” She raised\nher knife, stained with Mraize’s blood. “You helped make me, yes. That\nhasn’t saved any of the others.”\nShallan lunged, but Mraize had been overexaggerating his weakness. He\nseemed to have pulled in a little Stormlight—the anti-Light from her stab\nearlier had run out. He grabbed her arm and flung her to the side.\nBefore he could stab her, strong arms gripped him from behind. Radiant,\nin physical form, appeared from a white glowing mist. Shallan kicked him\nin the stomach, then advanced, prepared to do what she must.\nWhen a voice whispered in her ear—her own voice.\n“See it done, Shallan,” Formless said. “See him ended.”\nShallan froze, then searched the shadows of the tent, finding the figure\nthere. Shallan, but with swirling black mist for a face. Terrifying.\n“Kill him,” Formless said. “And kill Dalinar, who is always so\njudgmental of you.”\n“I would never,” Shallan hissed.\nRadiant vanished, dropping Mraize.\n“Dalinar is your father now,” Formless said. “Navani your mother. You\nwill hurt them, as you’ve hurt everyone else. You will destroy because you\ncannot build—and anything you pretend to create is just an illusion. Gone\nin moments.”\n“No,” she said. “No, I—”"

Panicked, she whispered, “Glys,\nTumi, pull me out!”\nThe lines of light faded as Dalinar and the others strode through the camp\noutside. Not gone, but waiting until the tenth person was found.\nDalinar felt the power within him as he walked, but … as an echo. As a\nmemory. This wasn’t real. He hadn’t actually sworn that oath … had he? He\nwould keep it, of course, as it was what he already intended to do. An oath\nwas the most powerful thing he knew, and without oaths, he wouldn’t even\nbe worth his name. He had made mistakes, had killed people he loved, but\nhe would never break an oath.\nThey passed soldiers who gaped at them as they glowed with Stormlight,\nmoving through the center of the camp toward the outskirts. Until they\nfound him.\nDalinar had seen Taln in the future—a hulking warrior with inhuman\nbulk and muscles. This was the same person, with the same daunting height,\nbut he was of a more … ordinary build. A little flabby, with his tunic askew\nand his belt too loose. He was caring for the horses.\n“The horse keeper?” Ishar asked, skeptical. “Wasn’t he dismissed from\nthe front lines and forbidden a weapon?”\n“Yes,” Jezrien said. “Nale, this is a bad idea.”\n“Honor said he wanted someone who had interaction with the gods,”\nNale said. “Well …”\nThe other two shared a look. Dalinar took the opportunity to glance at\nNavani, who—playing Wit—stayed on the periphery, holding hands with\nGav. She nodded to him.\n“How?” Dalinar asked Jezrien, curious. “How did he interact with the\ngods?”\n“Have you forgotten so easily?” Ishar asked.\n“I have had a lot on my mind,” Dalinar said. “Jog my memory.”\n“His soul is warped,” Jezrien said, “from his attempt to kill Cultivation.”\n“He deserves a second chance,” Nale said. “It will be good for us to have\nsomeone who is not a king among us.” Then, louder, he continued, “Taln!”\nTaln looked up from the horses, and something in Dalinar twisted as he\nsaw the man’s smile. Open, free of any pain or fear. “Nale?” he exclaimed,\nhis belly jiggling as he jogged over. “You’re glowing. I thought you hated\nSurges.”\n“Taln, I want you to meet someone.” He turned and said to Ishar, “Can\nyou ask Honor to join us?”\n“He is busy,” Ishar said, cocking his head. “Just a moment …” Soon\nHonor emerged, glowing and resplendent in his golden clothing.

The hum\nof power vibrated through Dalinar again, and the line of light connecting\nhim to the god burst alive.\n“Talenel,” Nale said, “this is Honor.”\nTaln frowned. He did not bow or show reverence, and instead looked the\ngod straight in the eyes. “I’ve waited a long time for this moment. And here\nI am. Without my weapon.”\n“This one?” Honor asked. “You know what he did.”\n“You wanted someone who’s had interaction with the gods,” Nale said.\n“Plus, I want contrary opinions in the group. For balance.”\nTaln was still staring eye to eye with Honor. “You destroyed an entire\nworld. My grandmother’s world.”\n“I … regret that,” Honor said. “I vow—upon my own power—that I will\nnot allow such destruction again.”\nTaln stood a moment. When he spoke, his tone was cool. “Well, I\nsuppose everyone deserves a second chance, even gods.” He stepped back\nto soothe a horse as a rumble of thunder sounded in the sky.\nDalinar couldn’t help walking up beside him. “You aren’t what I\nexpected,” he said.\nTaln narrowed his eyes at him. “What? Still frustrated I lost the weapon\nyou gave me, Kalak?” He patted the horse, then thumbed over his shoulder.\n“That’s the foreign king, I see. And you’re all glowing. You aren’t going to\nset the ground on fire, are you?”\n“I don’t intend to,” Dalinar said softly. “What happened to you?”\nHe got no response. Behind them, Jezrien said, “Nale, are you certain\nthis is a good idea?”\n“Should we not have someone among us,” Nale replied, “who represents\nanother kind of world? A world of people who can’t simply hand their\nhorses to someone else to take care of? A world where if your sandals wear\nout, you walk barefoot rather than commandeering them from the next man\nin line?” He looked at each of them in turn. “If we’re going to protect the\npeople, should we not represent the people?”\n“What is this?” Taln asked softly, glancing at them.\n“Immortality,” Tanavast said, his voice echoing the thunder from above.\n“I offer it to you, Talenel.”\n“Ah,” Taln said. “No, thank you. With all due respect.”\n“… Excuse me?” Tanavast said. “Isn’t this what all men secretly want?”\n“I have heard too many stories,” Taln said. “Living out those eons\ndoesn’t suit men well. Though if you have a new pair of sandals, I wouldn’t\nmind those.”\n“I offer powers unimaginable,” Tanavast said.\n“I can imagine quite a lot,” Taln said, “and some of it is downright\nterrible. I think I will pass.”\n“Well,” Ishar said, “there, he said it. Let us find another.”\n“No,” Nale said. “He’s perfect. I know what happens when the power\ngoes only to those who want it, Taln.”\nTaln hesitated, then turned again toward Nale.\nWho held up the small stone disc with the animal head on it. “If you join"

Dalinar couldn’t see why—but it seemed to no\nlonger be an indication of debt. It meant something else.\n“Which is why,” Honor said, “I think Nale is right. You are a good\nchoice. Wise.”\n“No,” Taln replied. “Not wise. Scared. Why … why do you want this of\nme?”\n“The enemy is being reborn,” Honor explained. “They become immortal,\nand humankind must have immortals to fight them.

We will close a\nloophole that has allowed Odium to meddle, and we will provide\nchampions to stand against the tide of darkness. You once were a soldier.\nBecome one anew.”\nTaln looked at the glowing people, the god, and Ishar. Then to Dalinar.\nTo Dalinar, he asked the question none of them had. “And what is the\nprice?”\n“Pain,” Dalinar whispered.\n“By binding away the enemy, you might be bound with them,” Tanavast\nsaid. “As an immortal, you will watch everyone around you grow old, then\ndie. You will have power none can understand, and you will be lonely,\nisolated. Years will blend like drops of water that form streams.”\nTaln nodded slowly, then did something unexpected. He thought.\nRainwater streaming down his face, dripping from his chin, he considered\nin silence for a good two minutes. It felt like an eternity.\n“If not me, you’ll find another?” Taln said.\n“Yes,” Tanavast said.\n“Then I’ll do it,” Taln said, walking up, taking the little disc from Nale.\n“How do I begin?”\nThat made Dalinar worry. They’d seen the moment their anchor had\nbeen connected to, which meant the vision could start to decay at any\nmoment.\n“Swear to Honor,” Tanavast said, “that you will protect this land. And\nhold back the darkness.”\n“I will protect the people of this land,” Taln whispered. “I will hold back\nthe darkness. Not for Honor. But I’ll do it.”\n“That is enough,” Honor said.\n“I swear as well, last of all,” Ishar said. “To bind this Oathpact. I will\nprotect this land. I will hold back the darkness.”\n“And so,” Tanavast said, “you bind me, as I bind you. We need the\nothers.”\nHurry! Dalinar thought. Make me an Honorblade!\nThey returned to the tent, where the others waited. Dalinar covertly took\nNavani’s hand, willing the next part to happen quickly. Ishar Connected\nTaln and himself with Light.\n“Now,” the god said, “it shall be done. Once finished, Vedel can do her\npart and seal your immortality. Each Herald of Honor, stretch forth thy\nhand.”"

Each Herald of Honor, stretch forth thy\nhand.”\nTen people, in a circle, hands outstretched. Dalinar’s heart trembled as,\none at a time, Honor pulled something from within his chest—and held it\nout. A glowing splinter of Light that formed a Shardblade when it touched a\nHerald’s waiting hand.\nThe tent began to evaporate around them right as Honor reached him.\nGripping Navani’s hand, Dalinar took that glowing piece of Light—and felt\nthe many Connections it contained. A stable anchor that could carry them\nfrom Desolation to Desolation, and hopefully let them finally reach the day\nwhen Honor himself had died.\nIn moments Shallan was back in the chaos of the Spiritual Realm. She\ntrembled, holding herself, then felt the arms of both Pattern and Testament\naround her.\n“Glys and Tumi are resetting that part of the vision,” Pattern whispered,\n“so Dalinar and Navani will find nothing wrong. Look.”\nShallan glanced to the side, and thought she could see it. Through a\nshimmering part of the landscape, like a waterfall, she could vaguely make\nout the tent. When Dalinar and Navani stepped in, all the chaos and blood\nhad vanished.\nOthers came with them. The Heralds.\nRadiant! she thought. Take over.\nIt’s all right, Shallan, Veil thought. You can see her now. You can survive\nthis. You’ve grown to where you can.\nShallan … allowed herself to remain in control. To watch. It was hard,\nand she was soon crying, but she did it. She held for just a minute, and\nheard a child’s voice crying in the back of her mind, then turned away and\ntook a few deep breaths. She … had further to go, but she’d done that\nmuch.\nGood, Veil thought to her. You’re healing, Shallan.\nBut what of Mraize? He’d gleaned information from her, and in the end\nshe’d broken down and let him escape. At least her fear of Formless was\nfading. The persona didn’t have the same power over her that it had during\nthe trip to Lasting Integrity. Perhaps her growth made her less susceptible.\nShe still didn’t know how or why it was manifesting. But, as she’d thought\nbefore, perhaps there didn’t need to be a reason. Any more than a person\nwith a chronic cough needed a reason for their ailment to return\nunexpectedly.\nEither way, she thought they needed a new approach for these visions.\nMraize won each confrontation. And Iyatil? What of her? Could the babsk\nperhaps be in another set of visions, accomplishing some other plan?\nMraize might be here simply to keep Shallan busy.\n“Take me to Renarin and Rlain,” she requested. “We have to do some\nbrainstorming.”\nBe content to play with your toys on their world of storms. Or do I\nhave to broadcast what I have learned of your goals? I certainly\ndo not think it a coincidence that you have made a special study\nof the worlds where legends abound of the dead being raised.\nWhat was this feeling Szeth felt?"

I certainly\ndo not think it a coincidence that you have made a special study\nof the worlds where legends abound of the dead being raised.\nWhat was this feeling Szeth felt?\nWas it … fondness? For this monastery in the small city on the island?\nStrange, to feel fondness, considering his hatred for it when he’d first\narrived.\nThose had seemed the darkest possible times—black as the hateful hour\nbetween moons. His imagination had been flawed, unable to grasp true,\npenetrating misery. Fortunately, experience had solved that deficit. A\nmoonless night still had stars. He hadn’t understood that until each and\nevery one of them had been ripped away, leaving him in a nothingness so\nabsolute, pain itself was a relief.\n“What a strange place to put a city,” Kaladin said, oblivious as usual.\n“Every time it rains, you’ll have to wait until the river dries out to cross.”\n“The river,” Szeth said, “does not dry out.”\n“Never?” Kaladin asked. “But …” He frowned. “It has to run out\nsometime. Where does the water come from?”\n“Ice melting,” Szeth said. “There are some permanent rivers like this in\nthe East. Merely fewer.”\n“Huh,” Kaladin said.\nSzeth started toward the bridge, and the others trailed along. None of\nthem flying—to avoid revealing themselves. That meant a long hike beside\nthe river, which flowed fat with rainwater. They crossed the wooden bridge\nto the city, which was empty. Just wooden walkways, clay brick cobbles,\nstreets flowing with muddy water, buildings applauding with raindrops. It\nwasn’t until they’d searched a half dozen structures that they found a\nwoman in one … sweeping the floor.\nShe jumped as they entered, then her hand went to her lips as she saw\nKaladin, his uniform marking him as an outsider.\n“It is well,” Szeth said quietly. “We’re simply travelers. We thought the\ntown empty.”\nThe woman wore a splash. A ragged blue apron. Though she was thin as\na sapling, she did not have that same cast to her eyes as the haunted people\nhe’d seen before.\n“Please,” Szeth said, gesturing for Kaladin to back away. “What\nhappened to the people of the city?”\n“It … feels like a dream,” the woman said at last, clutching her broom.\nThis was a finer house, a merchant’s or an officer’s quarters, but strewn\nwith recent refuse.\n“The shadow has passed,” Szeth said. “You know of what I speak? The\ndarkness that came from the monastery?”\nThe woman nodded, relaxing when Kaladin stepped back out into the\nrain.\n“How long has it been?” she whispered. “Since it began …”\n“Years,” Szeth said.\nShe gasped.\n“The others?” Szeth asked. “The rest of the town? They should be free\nnow. Where are they?”\n“Most were … sent at the start …” she said, looking into the distance.\n“To the first monastery. The Bondsmith. We were to gather there with\nweapons, then patrol the borders of Shinovar because someone was coming\n…” She focused on him, and her eyes widened. “You were coming.”"

We were to gather there with\nweapons, then patrol the borders of Shinovar because someone was coming\n…” She focused on him, and her eyes widened. “You were coming.”\nThis was not unanticipated, as there had been many reports of Shin\ntroops on the northern borders. Hopefully none would be deployed against\nhim. Szeth did not relish the idea of cutting through innocents to reach the\nfinal monastery.\n“I stayed behind,” the woman explained. “My leg, you see. So when my\nmind cleared …” She glanced around the room. “I lived in this filth. I can’t\n… believe that …”\nSzeth left her with a suggestion she make her way southward, then\njoined Kaladin, who had been listening at the door with Syl interpreting.\nLike most spren, her shape was disturbed slightly by the falling water.\nWith his bundle of swords on his back, Szeth walked toward the\nmonastery at the center of the city. He thought he periodically heard\nNightblood speaking softly, talking to the Honorblades. Learning from\nthem, it seemed.\nKaladin and his spren hurried after. “Szeth, did you hear that?” Kaladin\nsaid. “They went to the final monastery?”\n“Then to the border, yes,” Szeth said.\n“Maybe the Unmade is at that first monastery, the last one on your list.”\n“I think it must be. But before I go there, I want to free as many people\nas possible.” The rain was slackening, and sunlight—pure sunlight—began\nto break through the clouds above. “You may go on without me, if you\nwish.”\n“I told you I’d stay,” Kaladin said, “and I mean it. But Szeth … you\nnever told me about your meeting with an Unmade. Maybe we can identify\nwhich one it is; I learned of them all in officer meetings with Jasnah. This\nsounds like Ashertmarn.”\n“I have said what I intend to say.” He left Kaladin stewing and walked\nup to the monastery, feeling again that stirring sense of familiarity. How\ndare this place feel like home? This was where he’d taken his first step\ntoward being Truthless. It was where he’d discovered the shamans lied.\nHe stepped inside the great hall, as the gates had been left open. The\nvoices of the dead grew … softer here, as if in reverence. He could hear the\nwater outside, drops pouring from the rooftop sounding louder than the rain\nhad.\nThe monastery was empty. I wonder … Szeth thought, then found\nhimself turning right, Kaladin and Syl following. He trailed down a hallway\nwindowed with thin slits. The acolyte rooms were beyond, wooden, with\nmetal door handles and stone floors. Purposely designed to force the\nshaman acolytes to become accustomed to touching metal, as some arrived\nwithout first becoming soldiers. Szeth remembered listening to many of\nthem sobbing in the night after arriving.\nThe soldiers had not cried. They’d bled their tears out long ago. He\ncounted down seven rooms, walked to his bunk inside. Strange, how he\ncould remember each place he’d ever slept for any length of time. Was that\nnormal? Close his eyes, and he could easily imagine the floor of his home,"

The barracks at Talmut’s monastery. Then here. A bunk\nthat was a little too small, even for him. He knelt beside it and ran his\nfingers over the wood of the frame.\nHe removed the loose block by the wall, reached in, and came out with a\nhandful of scratchy wool. Sewn together into the shape of a lamb.\nOh, glories within …\nArrow slits in the hall sent lines of light through the doorway to the\nfloor, one on either side of him, like glowing spikes. He’d been so strong,\nso sure he didn’t need anything, until that moment. Until he trembled,\nsqueezed his eyes shut, then put the small toy to his forehead.\nAnd wept.\nKaladin haunted the doorway into the small chamber, feeling weirdly out of\nplace. Szeth had come directly here. Now he was … crying?\nThe Assassin in White, kneeling on the floor by his discarded pack of\nswords, blubbering over a toy? It made sense after only a moment’s\nconsideration.\n“You had a younger brother,” Kaladin said. “Why didn’t you tell me?”\n“No,” Szeth said hoarsely. “I … didn’t mention this toy in my story to\nyou … did I?”\n“You came here for it,” Kaladin said. “Who was the child who died, the\none you couldn’t protect?”\nSzeth still knelt, head bowed, and Syl tapped Kaladin on the arm. “Kal,”\nshe whispered. “Can’t you see? It’s his. He was the child.”\nThe words shook Kaladin, inverting his perspective like that first time\nhe’d stood on the wall of a chasm. Szeth’s toy?\n“Storms,” Kaladin whispered. All this time, he’d been looking for the\nconnection between him and Szeth, wanting to see that Szeth was like him.\nHowever, that wasn’t quite right. Szeth wasn’t so much like Kaladin as\n…\n“Szeth,” Kaladin said. “How old were you when they took you from\nyour home?”\n“Eleven,” Szeth whispered, hoarse. “I was eleven.”\nSzeth wasn’t Kaladin.\nSzeth was Tien.\nSzeth wasn’t the young man who had gone to war, determined to save\nand protect. He was the child who had been ripped from his peaceful life,\nthen transformed into a killer against his will. A scared little boy who just\nyearned to go home.\nKaladin had been thrown off by Szeth’s competence—he moved like\nKaladin did, seemed to know the weapon intrinsically. Except Szeth hated\nthe spear, while Kaladin loved it. He should have seen.\nStorms. Something broke in Kaladin. He stumbled away from the room\nand put his back to the stone wall of the hallway outside. Syl followed,\nconcerned.\n“I keep expecting him to become likable,” Kaladin whispered to her. “Or\nat least reasonable. I keep having trouble helping him because he’s not like\nthe men at Urithiru, the ones I understood, the ones who wanted my help\n…”\n“But …?” she asked."

I keep having trouble helping him because he’s not like\nthe men at Urithiru, the ones I understood, the ones who wanted my help\n…”\n“But …?” she asked.\n“Those were foolish expectations on my part,” Kaladin said. “A child\ntaken from his home and twisted into a killer isn’t going to be likable.\nPeople who need help aren’t going to be reasonable all the time.\nStormfather knows, I often wasn’t.”\nSuddenly, he needed to help Szeth. Not because of Dalinar’s request, not\nbecause of past failures. But because this was a person in pain, and Kaladin\nwas perhaps one of the few people in a position to help.\nUnfortunately, by the time he stepped back to the room, Szeth had\nrecovered. He’d returned the stuffed toy to its hole, and was wiping his\nhands on his white trousers. He replaced his long white raincloak with a\nflourish that sprayed water across the room, then he picked up the bundle of\nswords.\n“Szeth?” Kaladin said as the man pushed past him and into the hallway.\n“We must be moving,” Szeth said. “I would like to check the Edgedancer\nmonastery, though we’ll then need to retrace our steps a little. Fortunately,\nwe have recharged our Stormlight, and can afford to fly.”\n“Szeth, it’s not your fault, what they did to you.”\nSzeth stopped a little farther down the hallway.\n“The world needs killers,” Kaladin said. “So if it can’t find them, it\nmakes them out of whatever raw materials are at hand. Like children who\nlove to dance.”\n“I murdered a man,” Szeth said, facing away from Kaladin. “I wasn’t\nsome random choice.”\n“You protected yourself, Szeth.”\n“I meant to kill him, even before he tried to strangle me.”\n“But you weren’t going to,” Kaladin said. “Don’t lie. You told me what\nhappened.” He glanced at Syl—who nodded, encouraging him.\nSzeth started walking again.\n“Rule number one,” Kaladin called after him. “You’re not a thing.\nYou’re a person. Rule number two, you get to choose. And there’s a third\nrule, Szeth. You deserve to be happy.”\nSzeth put one hand to the wall and let the bundle of swords slump from\nhis other hand onto the floor. “Why?” he asked, his back bowed. “Why\nwould I deserve happiness? Give me a single good reason, bridgeman.”\nKaladin took a gamble. A line that wouldn’t be true for everyone, and\nwould be dangerously untrue to say to some who had come from places of\nabuse. But he’d heard enough of Szeth’s story, despite the parts that the man\nobviously hadn’t shared.\n“One good reason, Szeth?” Kaladin replied. “I’ll give you two. One\nmother. One father. I don’t know where your parents are, if they’re still\nalive or if they’ve passed, but I’ll tell you this. They loved you. They want\nyou to be happy.”\n“I don’t deserve their names,” Szeth said. “The things I’ve done …”\n“Things you were made to do,” Kaladin said, stepping forward. “I spent\nyears believing my parents would hate me for my failings, but I knew—I"

You know too, don’t you?”\nSzeth looked away. So Kaladin stepped forward again, careful, as if he\nwere approaching a timid animal.\n“You are not a thing,” Kaladin whispered. “You can choose. What do\nyou want, Szeth?”\n“You’re wrong,” Szeth said, harsh. He turned, then cocked his head—\nand was probably hearing the spren. That cursed highspren who hovered\naround him, unseen, whispering lies. “I … I’m flawed. My choices can’t be\ntrusted. I do not know right and wrong.”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “Szeth, listen to what that spren is saying, then\nthink. When you were about to hit that soldier as a child? You said you\nstopped, until he tried to kill you. When you killed at Taravangian’s\ndemands, you knew it was wrong. Damnation, you knew there was\nsomething wrong in your homeland. They exiled you, but you knew. Each\ntime, you knew. If you’d been the one to decide, if you’d truly been in\ncontrol, people would still be alive. You can choose. So don’t lie to me and\nsay otherwise.”\n“I …” Szeth blinked. “People … people are still dead, Kaladin. I still\nkilled them.”\n“Then do better,” Kaladin said. “Try to fix the problem, make restitution.\nBut Szeth, you can’t do better if you’re dead. I’m telling you that you, and\nall of us, can do better. Choose better.” Kaladin stepped right up to Szeth\nand extended his hand. “We talk a lot about taking responsibility, Szeth. It’s\nwhat Dalinar teaches, and storm me if it’s wrong, but I don’t think you have\nany difficulty taking responsibility.\n“The truth is, there’s a balance. You are a product of what life, society,\nand people have done to you. You bear blame for what you did, but others\nbear a lot of it too. It’s never too late to accept that your past might not be\nan excuse, but it is a valid explanation. So tell me. What do you—Szeth-\nson-Neturo—want for yourself? With no influence from anyone else, not\neven me. What do you want?”\nSzeth gazed at Kaladin’s open, extended hand. The man was trembling,\nand Kaladin couldn’t tell what of the wetness on his face was rain, what\nwas sweat, and what was tears.\n“If I choose this,” Szeth whispered, “it’s as good as admitting that there\nare no right answers. That no one knows the truth. That terrifies me.”\n“It means,” Kaladin said, “that neither truth nor answers are easy to find.\nWe still have to try, rather than giving up that responsibility to someone\nelse. Maybe someone has found the truth. I certainly hope so. But let’s talk\nabout what you genuinely want, and work from there.”\n“I want …” Szeth said. “I … want to stop killing.” He looked to Kaladin,\nwide-eyed, as if admitting this were some terrible transgression. “I want to"

I want to cause no more pain.”\n“Then we’ll figure that out.”\n“It’s impossible,” Szeth whispered. “I have to cleanse my homeland. I’m\ntoo great a weapon to be left alone. Someone will find me. Someone will\nuse me. That’s why I put myself in Dalinar’s care, because I hoped that at\nleast I’d be used well. I can’t imagine a world where—”\n“Szeth,” Kaladin cut in. “We’ll find a way.”\nSzeth stared at Kaladin, then finally took his outstretched hand. Kaladin\nhad anticipated a firm handshake, but Szeth went for the full hug, like a\nchild needing reassurance from a parent. Which was strange, considering\nhow much older Szeth was than him—only now, Kaladin could see the\neleven-year-old boy in the assassin. A boy who was never allowed to grow\nup, and who had somehow maintained a fragile child’s view of morality.\nSo, Kaladin held Szeth, who quivered, whispering, “I want to stop\nhurting people. I want to stop being a source of pain. I never want to be\nforced to take another life. I want to be done, Kaladin. I want to be done.”\nKaladin held tight as Syl popped up from behind Szeth and—grinning—\ngave Kaladin an encouraging double thumbs-up. Was this what Wit had\nmeant by being a therapist? Kaladin supposed that once in a while, every\nperson—even ruthless assassins—needed a hug.\nSzeth took a deep breath and stepped back. “I don’t see how I can have\nwhat I want. My people do need me to help them. That requires killing the\ncorrupted Honorbearers.”\n“Does your spren have any ideas?” Kaladin said, picking up the bag of\nswords so Szeth wouldn’t have to carry it. A foolish question perhaps, but\nhe was hoping he could involve the highspren and maybe get the thing to\nhelp, rather than hurt.\n“He left this morning, running in shame,” Szeth said. “I think he realized\nthat after his failings in Shadesmar, I would no longer look toward him as I\nonce had.”\nSo Szeth hadn’t been hearing the spren earlier? That troubled Kaladin.\nHe started to follow Szeth out, then turned as he noticed Syl ducking back\ninto the room. He peeked in, finding her fiddling with the loose brick. She\npulled on it, her arms straining, her back bent with the effort.\n“Syl?” he said. “That’s far too heavy for you. You—”\nThe stone slid. Kaladin started as Syl, eager, reached into the hiding spot\nand pulled out the small toy. Kaladin could now see that it was in vaguely\nthe shape of an animal with four legs and fluffy hair. A sheep—Kaladin had\nseen them grazing on the hillsides.\nSyl pulled it close, with a grin. It was small, about the size of a child’s\nhand, but still. Kaladin remembered a time when she’d had trouble carrying\na leaf."

She bobbed along next to him as\nhe caught up with Szeth. Together they walked from the monastery and into\nthe sunlight. To find an ominous figure waiting in the courtyard outside.\nHe stood with two highspren splitting the air near his head. An imperious\nman, dark skin with cool undertones, a crescent birthmark on his cheek.\nTall, strong, bald, cut as if from stone. Wearing a sharp black uniform\nmarked with silver.\nNalan’Elin, Herald of Justice.\n“Sir?” Szeth stopped in place, then saluted.\n“I have come,” Nale said with a deep voice, “to accompany you on your\nquest.” He focused on Kaladin. “As I’ve been told that you need …\nminding.”\nKaladin met the Herald’s eyes, and softly cursed. Szeth’s spren hadn’t\ngone “running in shame.”\nIt had gone running for reinforcements.\nYou feign altruism. But you have another motive, do you not?\nWell, you always have.\nI had already decided to follow,” Notum explained to Adolin, Colot, and\nMay in Adolin’s command tent.\nThe spren had grown to full size and glowed softly, standing at an odd\nkind of attention with one arm to his breast and the other folded behind his\nback. He spoke in that same formal way as always, as if giving a report to\nsuperiors.\n“How though?” Colot asked. “From what Adolin says, there was a great\nocean between you and here.”\n“I … I realized, right after Brightlord Adolin left, that staying behind\nwas cowardice on my part.” Notum drew himself up. “I determined to come\njoin the fight, though I’m not going to be a Radiant spren. I will not give\nany human that power over me. That doesn’t mean I can’t help.”\n“But Radiants are what we need!” May said, seated at Adolin’s writing\ndesk in her battle leathers. “If we had more Windrunners, we—”\n“Peace, May,” Adolin requested. “We shouldn’t try to force the Radiant\nbond on anyone.”\nThat she didn’t like that idea was clear from the way she drew her lips to\na line.\nNotum nodded to Adolin in thanks. “I was going to try to find a means to\nsail all the way to the Oathgate here. Then, that first night, I heard a voice.”\n“Was it Maya?”\n“Your spren?” Notum asked.\n“She doesn’t belong to me,” Adolin said. “She’s my comrade in arms.\nShe went to the honorspren dissenters for help.”\nHow could she have gotten so far?

It had taken weeks to cross that\ndistance by ship, and while Adolin had the sense that she was traveling a\ndifferent way—swept along by the beads as deadeyes sometimes were—she\ncouldn’t have arrived so quickly, could she?\n“I do not know her voice well,” Notum said. “So I could not say. This\nwas a quiet feminine voice, calling me to arms. I made my decision at that\nmoment, and I allowed the hopes and thoughts of humankind to draw me\ninto the Physical Realm. I came to myself about a day later, and flew here.”\n“One day?” Colot said. “You spent only one day disoriented? It took\nSylphrena years, I believe.”\n“The mind-dampening has been growing shorter and shorter,” May said\nfrom her desk. “Still, one day is remarkable. Particularly for a spren who\nisn’t intending to form a Radiant bond. What’s holding him here, Adolin?”\n“What do you mean?” Adolin asked.\n“The Radiant bond is a symbiosis,” May said. “Which means the bond\ngives something to both parties. Like … a contract. The human gets access\nto the Surges that are an innate aspect of the spren. In return, the spren gets\nstability in this realm. A human mind and soul to anchor them to the\nphysical world, without which spren have trouble thinking and\nfunctioning.”\n“I do not find it difficult,” Notum said. “But I am firm about not being\nbonded. You aid the war effort without being Radiants. Why can I not do\nthe same?”\n“You already did,” Adolin said. “You saved a Shardbearer today, Notum.\nThank you.”\n“You rescued me from torture,” Notum said to Adolin, “at the hands of\nthose Tukari. It is an honor to return the favor.” He drew himself up even\nstraighter. “I formally request a battlefield commission under your\ncommand, Adolin Kholin. I cannot hold a weapon in this realm, but I will\nbe of service to you. I promise it.”\n“I accept the offer, Captain Notum,” Adolin said. “I’ll put you in charge\nof my messenger corps, if May approves.”\n“I have my hands full with reports and archery training,” she said,\n“considering that I have a new apprentice.” She leaned forward and\ncontinued making battle reports to Urithiru via spanreed. “An invisible,\nflying spren to lead our messengers would be an advantage. And maybe\nhe’ll eventually realize what he should truly be doing.”\nAdolin tried shaking hands with Notum, but he could barely feel the\nspren’s touch. Afterward, Notum bowed instead.\n“Thank you,” Notum said. “For giving me a place, unconventional\nthough it is. We will hold back the enemy, Adolin. Remember, Honor is not\ndead.”\n“Not so long as he lives within us,” Adolin said. “Good to have you,\nNotum. I grant you a field commission as a captain in the Cobalt Guard.\nColot, would you process him? Though I suppose he won’t be needing\nrations or a quartermaster requisition allotment …”"

Though I suppose he won’t be needing\nrations or a quartermaster requisition allotment …”\nThey left, and Adolin strolled over to May, watching her scribble out\nlines on her report. He’d never felt the desire to learn to read himself.\nPerhaps he should have, but there was plenty else to do. Plus, he’d had\nenough of being like his father. Echoes of that reverberated from earlier in\nthe day—being the killer the situation required.\nNot simply a killer, he thought, remembering his mother’s voice and\nface. I kill for a cause—something that matters.\n“I still find that spren’s arrival strange,” May said as she wrote. “He\nshould need more time to adjust.”\n“Maybe we don’t know everything about the process yet,” Adolin said.\n“Isn’t that what science teaches? That we should never assume we have all\nthe answers, and we should keep testing what we observe against what we\nthink we know?”\nMay hesitated, the pen on her page halting. “Well, yes. How do you\nknow that?”\n“Shallan talks about it,” he said, smiling. She reportedly was still on her\nsecret mission to deal with the Ghostbloods. Her squires weren’t worried,\nbut Adolin couldn’t help but be anxious. How would he know if she was in\ntrouble and needed help? What if it was weeks until he saw her again? She\ncould handle herself, but … storms, he hoped she was safe.\n“And you actually listen when she speaks of womanly things?” May\nasked. “When we were not-courting, all I could get you to listen to was\nhistorical battle accounts.”\n“Guess I’m expanding my horizons.”\nMay huffed, making another note. “She’s good for you.”\n“You have no idea. Any word from Urithiru today?”\n“Battle reports from the Shattered Plains,” she said, sliding him a sheet\nfor a scribe to read to him later. “They’re holding against an incredible\nnumber of Fused, but worry about dwindling Stormlight supplies. No\nsurprises yet at Thaylen City.”\n“Nothing further about my wife?”\n“I tried to ask the fool, as requested,” she told him. “But no one can find\nhim. Your aunt, though, sent you this short reply: she believes that Shallan\nand your brother are both doing a very important task. That is all.”\n“Well, it’s something,” he said, taking the page with the battle report.\n“Thank you.”\n“I am glad,” May said, continuing to write, “that you and I did not work\nout as a couple. I think we’d have hated one another eventually. I’m glad\nyou found someone better suited to you, though I thought you and Shallan a\nstrange pairing until I realized something. You both share the same sense of\nwhimsy.”\n“I don’t have a whimsical bone in my body, May.”\nMay eyed him, then kept writing.\n“What?” he said.\n“I thought you more self-aware than that,” she said. “Don’t you have a\ndinner appointment with the emperor?”\nShe was right, and he probably shouldn’t keep the emperor waiting—"

Adolin left her to her reports,\namused she thought him whimsical. Today he’d washed free the blood, but\nthe brutal destruction he’d caused chased him. That was the job, after all.\nHe felt a comforting reassurance from Maya, though no words. She was\ntoo far away. He wished he knew if Notum had been her doing or not—\ncertainly, his arrival was proof that spren could be of great value on the\nbattlefield. Maya’s quest was relevant, and not too problematic, so long as\nAdolin didn’t run out of Shardhammers.\nBut at the same time, he had to shoo away anxietyspren at the worry her\nquest wouldn’t be enough. A dozen honorspren wouldn’t mean much if\nthose reinforcements didn’t arrive. Adolin glanced at the dome, trying to\nimagine holding here five more days without further troops, and shivered at\nthe thought.\nHe couldn’t quash the fear that once again, he wouldn’t be enough.\nBattle report from the Shattered Plains in hand, he shook his head and went\njogging toward Yanagawn’s tent for their nightly training and games of\ntowers.\nSigzil flew through the chasms of the Shattered Plains with two of his\nsquires. Via spanreed, Leyten had advised Sigzil to come in low, unseen, so\nhe moved through darkened chasms, lit occasionally from the red lightning\nabove. A low misting of rain meant that water streamed through the slots in\na quiet gurgle. Not a rushing roar, and not particularly dangerous.\nFortunately, each plateau was numbered on his map for reference, and\nthat ultimately got him to the correct spot. There he found Leyten and his\nsquires hovering low, peeking up over the edge of a plateau. Sigzil flew to\nthem and gave the salute of the day, and they gave the proper response.\nA set of flashes on Sigzil’s bracer indicated that the assault on Narak had\nbeen rebuffed. The enemy was withdrawing for now. The coalition army\nwould retreat from Narak Four eventually, but today’s hard fighting was\nworth something—with that wall broken, the enemy would keep\nconcentrating attacks there, maybe earning the other plateaus breathing\nroom.\n“You were right to send me looking for the Heavenly Ones,” Leyten\nwhispered to him, pointing at a group of them soaring just ahead. “One of\nour scout nests spotted them out here; it seems all of them are in this region,\npatrolling. I bet they’ve got orders to keep humans away from whatever is\nhappening over there. I don’t think they spotted me or my squires though.”\nSigzil considered, spending some time watching the Heavenly Ones.\n“Thoughts?” he whispered.\n“I think I can estimate a proper heading,” Vienta whispered. “Judging by\ntheir guard pattern, they are trying to keep people away as Leyten said. A\nplace farther north, along the edge of the Shattered Plains.”\nSigzil turned toward the others. “You have cloaks?”"

        "text": "their guard pattern, they are trying to keep people away as Leyten said. A\nplace farther north, along the edge of the Shattered Plains.”\nSigzil turned toward the others. “You have cloaks?”\nLeyten’s squires broke them out. The policy was to wear or carry them\nwhen on patrol—and swathed in these buttoning, hooded black cloaks, they\nweren’t nearly as noticeable. Stormlight still streamed off their skin and\ntighter clothing, but it tended to get caught in the folds of the cloaks and\nevaporate.\n“We’ll go in through the chasms,” Sigzil said. “Leyten, me, Weiss, and\none of Leyten’s squires. The rest of you, wait for our signal in case we need\nyou.”\nCareful Lashings sent them zipping through the network of chasms with\nSigzil in the lead—map in hand, its surface waxed against the rain. The\nlightning above seemed focused in a specific region, so he flew that\ndirection, passing chasms littered with refuse that was overgrown with life.\nHere he found the strangely companionable scents of growth and decay,\nlifespren and rotspren dancing together above the streaming water. There\nwere fewer corpses than he remembered from his days as a bridgeman.\nMore bits of trees and shell. The Shattered Plains were moving on from the\ntime when human and listener clashed atop them every few days.\nHe consulted with Vienta, who flew up to watch the enemy search\npatterns. Eventually the group reached the edge of the Plains—and indeed,\nthat was exactly where the lightning was concentrated. Here, Sigzil\ncarefully led them upward. In leaving the gurgling chasm floor, he felt as if\nhe were parting from an old friend. The chasms had been Bridge Four’s\npunishment at first, then their respite, then their shelter as they practiced.\nThe very skills he now used as a warrior had been seeded in this network of\ntombs, where he’d first wielded a spear with those who would become his\nbrothers.\nHe and Leyten peeked carefully up over the rim of the chasms, looking\nout at the hilly—even mountainous—landscape north of the Plains. It was a\nregion he’d rarely visited, and then only when flying scouting missions.\nHere, on a field of stone beneath violent lightning—which was almost\nconstant—an army was gathering. Hundreds of enemy soldiers, their wet\ncarapace reflecting lightning.\nRegals. How? How had the enemy brought in these reinforcements?\nThey couldn’t have walked from Alethkar. That was hundreds of miles.\nHeavenly Ones and Skybreakers had been too busy fighting to transport\nanyone.\n“I don’t understand,” Leyten said, his voice barely audible over the\nthunder. “This should be impossible, Sig.”\n“Maybe they’re a Lightweaving,” Weiss said. The short, dark-haired\nsquire had been a seamstress before joining the Windrunners. “A grand\nshow meant to intimidate us.”\n“Best we know, Masked Ones can’t make giant Lightweavings on this\nscale,” Leyten replied. “They mostly just change their own features.”\n“We have evidence,” Sigzil said, “of Heavenly Ones creating occasional\nweak Lashings in others, though it uses up their power quickly. So it’s"

        "text": "“We have evidence,” Sigzil said, “of Heavenly Ones creating occasional\nweak Lashings in others, though it uses up their power quickly. So it’s\npossible Masked Ones can do the same. But I think that’s unlikely here.”\n“I … agree,” Vienta whispered. “No hypothesis I imagine can explain\nthis, Sigzil. Unless …”\n“What?” he whispered.\n“Unless they’ve figured out a way to Elsecall.”\nDamnation. “I’m going up,” Sigzil said.\n“Up?” Leyten hissed, grabbing his arm.\n“That light in the center of the army? I need to know what it is, but can’t\nsee from this perspective.” He glanced at the sky. “The lightning is going to\nhave everyone light-blinded; it will be storming difficult to locate me if I\nstay high enough.”\nLeyten considered, then nodded and let go of his arm. He probably\nwanted to insist on coming too, but knew that would double the chances of\nthem being spotted.\n“Be ready to flee just in case,” Sigzil said to the others. Then he\nwithdrew a few hundred yards before taking to the sky, doing something\nthey rarely dared—coming close to the cloud line of rippling red lightning.\nTo avoid that lightning, he moved fast, pulling his cloak tight and Lashing\nhimself to the north, back toward the gathering army. The constant flashes\nabove seemed the eyes of Odium, but he forcibly told himself it was no\nsuch thing. Odium couldn’t see everywhere at once. Many things slipped\nhis notice.\nAnd surely, if he had seen Sigzil, the response would have been\nimmediate. Because at the center of the gathering army was a hole in the\nground—a wide ring of violet light, the inside falling away like a pit.\nSoldiers jumped up from within it, soaring out of the hole, being seized by\ncompanions and stabilized as they landed.\n“Storms,” Sigzil whispered. “You were right. That’s an Elsegate, I\nassume?”\n“Yes,” Vienta whispered back. She appeared to him shrouded in\nbillowing cloth, like laundry on the line. “There’s only a few ways it could\nbe possible.”\n“How?” This power had created the Oathgates long ago, had brought\nhumans to Roshar. Despite years of trying, Jasnah hadn’t figured out its\nmechanics, and interrogations with Heralds hadn’t helped. The Fused\nshouldn’t be capable of large-scale manifestations like this.\n“It would mean,” she said, “that the enemy has empowered Dai-\nGonarthis again, which we all thought he’d never do. So outside of reason\nthat it was barely worth consideration. She wishes to break and burn this\nworld. Bad though that is, I am hopeful this is the case, because if it’s not\nher … then the enemy has the Elsecaller Honorblade.”\n“Storms,” he whispered, to the appropriate sound of rumbling thunder.\n“Would that we could experiment with the power …” Vienta whispered\nto him. “The two of us. All the time in the world, and an Elsecaller.”\n“See if we can create perpetual motion …” Sigzil said. “See if there are\nany limits to speed and distance …”"

        "text": "“See if we can create perpetual motion …” Sigzil said. “See if there are\nany limits to speed and distance …”\n“So many things to learn.” In a rare moment, her billowing cloth\nretracted around her face, and she smiled toward him.\nUnfortunately, there was still a war to fight. Sigzil used his spyglass to\nsee if he could spot an Honorblade or sign of an Unmade. He did locate an\ninteresting Fused. Tall, and standing apart from the others, with a body too\nsilvery to be natural. He knelt at the edge of the large portal in the ground.\nThen a figure jumped up out of the portal near the Fused. A human with\nbrown hair flecked with black, in a black uniform, carrying a familiar\nHonorblade. As he looked up, Sigzil could swear that this man’s eyes\nglowed violet. As if … as if they were gemstones full of Voidlight.\nSigzil knew this figure all too well. Moash. Once friend.\nTeft’s killer.\nEIGHTEEN YEARS AGO\nFor the second time in his life, Szeth waited on the other side of a door\nwhile people decided his fate.\nHe wasn’t a child any longer. He didn’t hide in bed, or cry into a blanket.\nHe stood outside the General’s door, his back straight, legs spread, hands\nclasped before him. Guard stance. He could hold it, motionless, longer than\nanyone he knew.\nInside, he trembled.\nHe’d stridden into battle—through smoke and fire and brine—where his\nplan had destroyed two ships and sent the raiders away, perhaps forever.\nHe’d thought himself immune from fear, even quietly bragged about it in\nhis head. Yet now? Now he had to force himself to breathe evenly so that he\ndidn’t start hyperventilating? Now he had to struggle to keep the emotions\nfrom flooding out as tears?\nWhat was wrong with him? He’d accepted punishment in the past. He\ncould do so again.\nEven if … even if this would be different.\nIt had been three days since Szeth’s operation. Forbidden his duties—or\neven sparring—during that time, he’d been left in misery to wait for this\ntribunal. Finally, Honorbearers had arrived—and now they all spoke\ntogether inside. With the General, his father, even the Farmer. Carried in by\nsoldiers so he wouldn’t have to step on stone. All because Szeth had used\nhis initiative in following orders.\nHe wished he could hear what they were saying. He could not, so he\nremained standing. Angry. Increasingly sick. Even the Voice was shunning\nhim lately.\nA footstep ground against the gravel walkway nearby. A normal sound to\nhim now. He glanced that direction, wondering who would approach the\nGeneral’s offices at a time like this. The answer should have been obvious.\nElid. His sister.\nAs an adult, Elid was still two inches taller than he was. She wore work\nclothing, and though she wasn’t a supervisor in the kitchens, she bore a\ndistinctive air of authority. Maybe it was the polished stone necklace of\nbeads, a badge of pride for a hobby no one outside the monasteries would\never enjoy. Maybe it was the way she strolled over and leaned with one"

Maybe it was the way she strolled over and leaned with one\nshoulder against the wooden wall, one leg lazily crossing the other. Long\nblack ponytail, keen eyes, knowing smile.\nElid navigated rules and social expectations like a fish in water. Whereas\nSzeth did it like a sword through entrails.\n“So,” she said, “you screwed up again.”\nHe glanced away from her, staring through the camp at nothing in\nparticular.\n“They’re gonna kick you out, eh?”\n“They can’t,” Szeth said softly. “I subtract. They can find something\nmiserable for me to do, they can execute me, or …”\nOr worse. They wouldn’t make him Truthless, would they? He hadn’t\ndenied Truth. He was trying to protect Shinovar.\nHe could feel Elid’s skeptical eyes on him. That woman … “What do\nyou want, Elid?” he snapped.\n“Just to see how you’re doing,” she said. “Szeth. It’s okay to rage and\nlose control sometimes. But you need to find better ways to express it than\nin battle.”\nRage? He looked at her, confused until he sorted through that statement.\n“Is that what they’re saying in camp?”\n“A lot of them have felt it,” she said, shrugging. “It’s why they’re here.\nThese are the men who can’t control themselves when they fight.”\n“I didn’t attack the outlanders out of rage, Elid,” he said. “I was told to\ndefend our shores.”\n“You were told,” she said, “to watch for any enemy that decided to strike\ninward. Why do you think the Farmer leaves offerings for them?”\n“Because he’s afraid.”\n“Because it works,” Elid said. “If they find easy goods, they take them\nand leave. They know if they burn down the fishing villages and steal all\nthe workers, the offerings stop.”\nThat wasn’t what the Voice said. The Voice said that the Farmer’s\nofferings would only make the enemy hunger for more and more. Szeth had\nthought, in the General’s orders—the way Szeth had been left to his own\ndevices on the coast these months, tasked with defensive operations—that\nthe General had understood.\nObviously not.\nObviously, he really had screwed up again.\n“I’m sorry, Elid,” he said. “For ruining your life.”\n“Eh, that life was boring,” she said. “Stones Unhallowed. To think, if\nnothing had happened, I might be sitting out in a field somewhere today.”\nShe shivered visibly.\n“You shouldn’t swear.”\n“Why not? You honestly think rock is holy?”\n“Of course it is,” Szeth said. “Ask Father.”\n“Szeth. Do you still not know why we lived apart from everyone else\nwhen we were young?”\nHe closed his eyes. He … he didn’t want to know. Life already confused\nhim too much. That unsettled sense continued when, of all things, Elid\nhugged him.\nThis made him break his stance, put his arms to the side in surprise. She\nembraced him. Elid.\n“Listen,” she said. “Father will work it out. Everyone knows your heart\nis right.”"

You’ll get through this, whatever happens.” She nodded\nto him encouragingly, then backed off as the door opened.\nFather beckoned Szeth to enter. Szeth did so, trying to recover his\ncomposure. It was difficult. Three Honorbearers stood inside. Pozen, with\nhis white beard and accusatory eyes. Sivi, with a smile. Vambra, who\nwasn’t as familiar as the other two. A woman young to be an Honorbearer,\nwith long golden hair.\nThe Farmer appeared older than Szeth remembered. More white in his\nhair, somehow more attention-drawing than the colorful clothing. He was\nstanding on the wooden floor beside Rit-daughter-Clutio, the head shaman\nof the monastery with no Blade.\nThe General was the last one, gazing out the window, hands clasped\nbehind him. “We have consulted, Szeth-son-Neturo,” he said softly. “What\nyou did was reckless, destructive, and insubordinate. Your father spoke of\nyour good nature and your skill, which we have taken into account. In the\nend, however, we cannot ignore the danger you bring upon all of us. It is\nour inclination to send you to the mines.”\nThat was …\nWell, that was what he’d expected.\nSzeth remained in his stance.\n“Son?” the Farmer said. “Do you have anything to say?”\nSzeth frowned. “Should I say something?”\nThe others shared glances.\n“I did what I was told,” Szeth said. “If I misinterpreted so badly, then\nyou are correct to decommission me.” Saying it brought a huge weight off\nhis shoulders. “Maybe … maybe this is for the best.”\nThis seemed to concern several of them, but the Farmer—swathed in\ncolor—smiled openly.\n“You are right, Szeth,” the Farmer said, his voice kindly. “I’m glad you\nsee it. In anticipation of your willingness to cooperate, I’ve insisted that\ninstead of hard labor, you be given a post at the high pass to watch for\nstonewalkers entering our lands. I sometimes go there to meet foreign\ntraders; it is beautiful, Szeth. A lonely post, yes, but also good for solitary\nthinking.” He paused. “You could keep sheep, as soldiers there do for\nfood.”\nSheep? Herding flocks again?\nOh … how incredible that would be.\nHe could imagine it: A quiet post, far from where he could do harm. As\nmany sheep as he wanted, and he’d slaughter only the elderly and infirm, at\nthe end of their lives. Quiet winds. Dancing.

He found, as he looked up and met the Farmer’s eyes, that\nhe wasn’t frightened any longer.\nWell, this won’t do, the Voice said in his head. Not after you finally\nstarted proving yourself. I’m sorry for getting distracted. I nearly missed\nthis meeting, didn’t I?\nSuddenly, all three Honorbearers stood up straighter and went alert, as if\nthey’d been slapped. Then, as if one, they focused on Szeth.\n“Out,” Pozen said. “Everyone but Szeth.”\n“Excuse me?” the Farmer said. “But—”\n“OUT,” Pozen repeated, Honorblade appearing in his hand. He slammed\nit straight through the floor and into the stone. “Right now.”\nFather, Rit, and the General hurried out. The Farmer had to wait for his\nsoldier porters to come and pick him up off his ritual mat and carry him out\nbeyond the stones—but he went, appearing troubled the entire time.\nSzeth bore it all with a mounting sense of dread.\nAs soon as the door shut, Vambra—the Truthwatcher Honorbearer—\nwalked up to Szeth. She couldn’t be much older than he was, but spoke with\nauthority. “How long has he been talking to you?”\n“I …” Szeth barely maintained his stance; his instincts said he should\nflee this intense scrutiny.\n“How long?” Vambra repeated.\nIt’s all right, the Voice said. You may reveal me.\nOnly then did Szeth understand. “You hear it too?” He looked to the\nother Honorbearers. “All three of you?”\n“It is very rare,” Sivi said, “for one who is not an acolyte or a shaman to\nbe chosen. In fact, I can’t remember the last time it happened.”\n“I was six years in the monastery before I heard him,” Vambra said.\n“Soldier, you were asked a question.”\n“I heard the Voice that first day,” Szeth said, “when I killed that soldier\nas a child. I’ve … heard it regularly ever since.”\n“This was his plan?” Pozen asked. “Burning those ships?”\nOf course it was, the Voice said, and from the way they reacted, each of\nthem had heard it. There’s no Honorbearer in this monastery or region. I\nwork through other means here.\n“Why?” Szeth whispered. “Why wouldn’t you tell them?”\nIt does them good, the Voice said—and this time it seemed to be only for\nSzeth. They need to remember that they serve me, not the other way around.\nWait.\nThe Honorbearers served the Voice?\n“What is it?” Szeth said, unfolding his arms, breaking stance at last.\n“What is this Voice?”\n“That,” Sivi said, sounding reluctant, “is only for the highest members of\nour society to know.”\n“Regardless,” the elderly Pozen said, gesturing toward Szeth, “he needs\ntraining at a monastery. You’ve heard the reports of Szeth’s skill—they are\ntrue and unexaggerated. If there was an Honorbearer in this monastery, he’d\nhave been recruited long ago.”"

It said to send survivors back, when my plan had been\nto sink all three ships.”\n“Well, there you are,” Vambra said. “He’s rarely wrong. You did well,\nSzeth. Sorry for the confusion and hubbub.”\n“This is actually perfect,” Pozen said. “You should see my current crop\nof acolytes—not a standout among them. But this boy … If there’s a\nsolution to the Tuko problem, this might very well be it.”\nSzeth felt his freedom evaporating. Rainwater disappearing under the\nsun. His stomach churned, like during the first weeks after coming to the\nmonastery, when he’d started eating meat every day.\n“Do I need to do this?” Szeth whispered. “Must I?”\nYes, Szeth, you must, the Voice said. It is right.\nVambra clapped him on the shoulder as Pozen dismissed his Blade and\ncomposed himself, all three of them adopting more serious airs. They called\nout, and Szeth’s father opened the door for the General, who hesitantly\nentered.\n“We have something to tell you,” Pozen said with a stern voice. “The\nyoung man is in fact a hero.”\n“What?” the General said. “But—”\n“He was working on higher orders,” Pozen said. “His attack three days\nago was a trial of his abilities and leadership skill. Today’s conversation\nwas a test to see if he would take punishment with grace, which he did.\nWe’re moving him to my monastery to begin training as a shaman acolyte.”\nSzeth was glad to see the stunned look in the General’s eyes. For once,\nsomeone else was as confused as Szeth was.\nNeturo nodded slowly. “I’ll help him gather his things.”\n“No need,” Pozen said. “Once you become an acolyte, you must burn\neverything you own.”\nSzeth put his hand to the pouch at his belt. “Everything?”\n“Today, you become someone new, Szeth,” Pozen said. “Neither one\nwho adds nor one who subtracts—but someone holy, someone greater. You\ncome alone, as every child is born alone.”\n“A … alone?” Szeth said, his voice small.\n“No,” Neturo said.\nSzeth glanced to his father.\n“No child is ‘born alone,’” Neturo said. “He is born to a family. If Szeth\nis to go, we go with him.”\n“There will be no place for you in the monastery,” Pozen said. “You\ncan’t—”\n“Pardon,” Sivi said, “but there is a city outside your monastery, Pozen."

Of course I do. I won’t\nlet them take you away from us.”\nThe next part passed in a daze. An announcement in the camp: a\ncommendation for Szeth. Szeth didn’t get to see the expression on Jormo’s\nface as he was placed on a horse, and the servants of the Honorbearers\ngathered to begin their caravan home. Nearby, the Farmer stood on ritual\ncarpet on a box, on top of soil carried and placed here. A pillar of color in\nthe otherwise drab camp. He looked concerned as the ribbons tied to his\nrobes fluttered in the wind.\nNeturo came with a large pack on his back, and Elid followed. Szeth\nglanced away from her as she stepped up to his horse. “I’m sorry.”\n“Are you kidding?” Elid said. “Have you heard how great the cities are\naround active monasteries? This is going to be wonderful.”\nShould he think that way? Instead he felt sick. Even a little angry. So he\nlooked up behind him and he saw what he’d been expecting. What he’d\nbeen anticipating. His stomach turned over.\nHis mother stood there, and she bore no pack.\n“Zeenid,” Neturo said, walking to her. “We must—”\n“I’m not going, Neturo,” she said. “I’m not letting you do this to me\nagain.”\n“I …” Neturo said. “I didn’t—”\n“I’m going back to my old life,” she said. “I’m told, with cleansing and\npenance, I can return as if nothing had happened—because I never\nsubtracted. You never subtracted, Neturo. We didn’t need to do this.”\n“Zeenid,” Neturo said, “we can’t leave him.”\n“He’s an adult, Neturo,” Zeenid said. “Nineteen years old. Let go. For\nboth of your good.”\nThe Honorbearers chose that moment to start the caravan. Horses and\nporters began descending the long set of switchbacks. Szeth held his horse\nback, looking to his parents. To Neturo, who glanced at Szeth, then at\nZeenid, who averted her eyes.\n“Wait,” Elid said from beside Szeth’s horse. “Wait. Mom’s not coming?\nThat isn’t what … I mean …”\nMother spun and walked back toward camp. She didn’t say goodbye.\nNeturo whispered to Elid, asking if she wanted to stay with Mother—telling"

She didn’t say goodbye.\nNeturo whispered to Elid, asking if she wanted to stay with Mother—telling\nher it was a valid decision. She shook her head with tears in her eyes, so he\nturned her away from the sight.\nTogether, the three of them started after the caravan. Szeth hung his\nhead. Though he knew deep down that they hadn’t been a family for years\nnow, it still hurt. Because this break, last of all, seemed final.\nTHE END OF\nDay Five\nIt’s funny, Zahel thought, how many times I’ve been chained to the ceiling.\nZahel hung, naked, in a dark room. Unshaven, unwashed. He thought it\nhad been weeks since that first day—during the invasion—when he’d been\ntaken. The timing wasn’t clear though, because he had to keep erasing his\nmemories to help neutralize his captor’s torture.\nTorture. Why did they always default to torture? The research didn’t\nsupport its effectiveness, even in people who couldn’t erase memories of\nthe pain to prevent long-term trauma.\nBut then, he wasn’t a man of research any longer, was he? He wasn’t\nmuch of a man, or god, of anything these days. He groaned, pulling himself\nup a little by his arms to stretch. Beside him, out of reach—if his hands had\nbeen free—a sad, sorry parrot hung in her cage. Bright crimson, with shades\nof cherry, and a maroon on the darker parts of her wings. Very striking. She\ndidn’t look at him, remaining quiet.\nIt was bad when a parrot grew quiet.\n“Hey,” Zahel said, his voice hoarse. “Hey.”\nStupid bird didn’t react. It huddled down in its cage, without a proper\nperch.\nZahel sagged in his bonds. Blood crusted his naked body. They always\nknew to take his clothing, so he couldn’t bring it to life. Once in a while,\ncouldn’t he be captured by someone stupid? He bowed his head, his hair—\nnot quite black, more a deep chestnut—curling around his face. Stringy,\nunwashed.\nThe brightest splash of color in the circular room—lined in aluminum\nsheets, preventing even spren from sensing him—was the parrot. Other than\nthat, it was just his dried blood on the floor, a bookcase along one wall, and\na mattress on the other side, though it hadn’t been used by his captors in\nweeks.\nNot for the first time, he wondered why he kept struggling. Centuries.\nFriends failed. Most recently a woman abandoned, when she’d so believed\nin him …\nHe had told himself he was retiring.\nIn truth, he’d simply run.\nThe bird shuffled, but when Zahel glanced over, it had just lowered its\nhead.\nSo, with a sigh, Zahel tried something else. “Hey,” he said. He looked\naway, and looked back quickly. “Peeky time.”\nThe bird looked up.\nZahel repeated the infant’s game again. “Peeky time. Peeky time.”\nThen, slowly, the parrot perked up. “Peeky time …” it said in its avian\nvoice."

You …”\nHe trailed off as the door opened, and Axindweth—rings glittering on\nher fingers—slipped in. “Playing games, are we, Vasher?” She clicked her\ntongue, and the bright green Aviar on her shoulder mimicked the sound.\n“I have to do something to pass the time. Figure it will take you forty\nyears or so to die.” He met her eyes. “I can outlast you. I’ve done it before.”\nShe laughed. “Always blustering, Vasher.” She took a box from under\nher arm and opened it, displaying a fabrial shaped a little like a handgun,\nonly with spikes at the front.\nWell, hell. She’d finally gotten a painrial.\n“I have found,” Axindweth said, “a more efficient way of making you\nhurt, Vasher. Would you like a taste?”\nHe didn’t reply.\n“What if we compromised,” Axindweth said. “You give me half your\nBreaths, and I will let you go.”\nHalf his power, which was admittedly an incredible wealth of\nInvestiture. Zahel should never have brought so much; he’d known it would\ndraw attention.\nHe could give her half. He didn’t need those Breaths. Except he knew\nhow that would go. If he gave her half, she—after such a burgundy victory\n—would demand more. Then more.\nIt wasn’t a negotiating tactic. It wasn’t a path toward freedom. This was\njust another attempt to break him down.\nSo—feeling sorry for the parrot who had to watch—he didn’t say\nanything further until she made him start screaming.\nTaravangian struggled with balance. Even as his plots were playing out, the\npieces falling into line, he struggled. While he knew he needed to dominate,\nhe still questioned.\nWhy should he question?\nToday, his attention was on Shinovar. He was aware of his former\nservant, Szeth, traveling through this land, disrupting it. Though\nTaravangian had pieces in motion to ultimately control Shinovar, this place\nof flowing grasses and echoes of a dead world should have been easy for\nhim to dominate. It was not. It was instead a warning.\nHe considered from atop a mountain. His emotions, which flared so\npowerfully, cared more about the kingdoms he already had. Kharbranth. Jah\nKeved. Alethkar.\nI will need to focus on many foreign lands in the centuries to come, he\nthought. Shinovar, then, is good practice. If I cannot apply my focus to a\ndistant part of Roshar, how will I dominate all worlds, everywhere?\nCultivation appeared behind him. He did not need to look, for he had no\neyes.\n“You have tried as I asked?” she said.\n“Yes.”\n“And?”\n“Both halves of me reject your assumptions, Cultivation,” he\nproclaimed. “The mind finds it requisite of me to become the conqueror; the\nheart needs the same, if for different reasons.”"

In\nmathematics, sums and divisions were straightforward—but not so with\nsouls. Both heart and mind wished conquest, but the two together?\n“You,” she said, “were one of the few humans ever to taste divinity. A\nman who could think with incredible speed. A man who could feel the\npowerful crushing emotions of Odium. You had both the mind and emotions\nof a god.”\n“… Yet never,” he whispered, “at the same time. Until now.”\n“Please, Taravangian. Do you truly want to go down this path?”\nDid he?\nDid he legitimately?\nHe fixated on the people working so hard to resist him. He saw their\npassion, their ingenuity, and loved it. He realized now why he questioned.\nThere were two on this planet who, even as a divinity, he respected almost\nas equals. Jasnah Kholin and Dalinar Kholin. If they opposed him, then …\nhe questioned. For in his Ascension to godhood, he’d obtained a wisdom\nthat eluded most mortals. A simple, reasonable precept: if someone you\ndeeply respected disagreed with you, perhaps it was worth reconsidering.\nThat was when, for the first time, Taravangian legitimately wavered.\nThis problem was not academic, and not one simply of passionate instinct.\nThe question of opposing his friends cut to his very soul. For by its light, he\nsaw that he had been lying, even to himself.\nYes, it made sense to give the cosmere one god.\nYes, it was his passion to protect his people.\nBoth were true, but they were not the actual reason he’d done any of this.\nIn that moment of uncertainty, Taravangian did what even gods struggled to\ndo.\nHe saw the truth within himself, one he would never admit to any other\nbeing. Why conquer?\nBecause someday, someone would do it.\nAnd he wanted to be that one.\nThe burden of a king was to make the difficult choices, and he’d done\nthat for so many years. He longed to enjoy the rewards for those many\npainful sacrifices. He yearned to see what he could do, unhindered. What\nheights he could soar to, what accomplishments he—Taravangian, the\ngreatest of men, now divine—could achieve.\nConquest was not a need, but a want. And he was done denying himself\nthe things he wanted.\nThe power loved this revelation. It was pure, unfettered emotion.\nThe mind respected this revelation, for it was truth acknowledged.\nThe two, at that moment, became one. It was the moment of decision.\nTaravangian hung on that precipice and let himself question for one final\nmoment. What would Dalinar do? Two versions of Taravangian seemed to\nsplit off from him, walking into infinite time. Two people that he could be.\nDalinar …\nDalinar was wrong."

He coalesced an avatar in radiant, shining gold vestments and\nplaced a small cane to his side, the twin portions of his soul vibrating with\nthe same pure tone.

You now also know of my\nrevelations, if they may be called that, in full. Each of my visions\nis here. Each experience of my past that shaped me.\n—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar Kholin\nOn Nale’s arrival, Szeth became a different person. As they got ready for\nthe day, Kaladin tried to engage Szeth in conversation, but all he received\nwas simple answers spoken in a monotone. They then flew for much of the\nmorning, but landed to walk the rest of the way to the Lightweaver\nmonastery—which marked the halfway point in their journey. Szeth\ncontinued to think approaching on foot would be less conspicuous.\nSo Kaladin trudged along in the dirt, pack heavy on his back. The land\nhad grown dustier and dirtier as they’d moved northward, the air less\nhumid, with even the nights uncomfortably warm.\nThe plants here were of a … weedier nature. The small earthen road\nthey’d been following had become a much larger thoroughfare. Dusty,\ndespite the rainfall a day before. He couldn’t imagine what this would be\nlike when full of people and carts.\nDetermined, Kaladin fell into step beside Szeth—the two of them\ntrailing behind Nale, who strode along, imperious and tall. He somehow\ncollected less dust on his legs than Kaladin did, and apparently needed no\nwater or rest, for he called no breaks and expected them to drink from\ncanteens while walking. He looked like a lighteyes with two sorry soldiers\ntrotting along behind, carrying all his things.\nHe’s trying to rile you, Kaladin told himself. He probably wants to annoy\nyou to the point that you abandon Szeth to him.\nKaladin refused to get upset. “So,” he said, “how much farther is it?”\n“Not far,” Szeth said.\n“How often have you been to this monastery?”\n“A handful of times,” Szeth said. “Lightweaver was not my preferred\npair of abilities.”\n“What was it like?” Kaladin asked. “Training with each of the Blades?\nMust have been interesting.”\nSzeth shrugged, his eyes on Nale. Storms. It felt like their progress had\nbeen washed completely away in the highstorm rain. That was agonizing to\nKaladin, because now—seeing how much Szeth needed help, how much"

That was agonizing to\nKaladin, because now—seeing how much Szeth needed help, how much\nlike Tien he was—Kaladin’s passion for helping him had grown and grown.\nMaybe too far. It was physically painful to be unable to do anything to help.\n“Szeth,” he tried again, “can we talk about—”\n“We can talk,” Nale said from ahead. “Please. I hear you’ve been\noffering my disciple radical philosophy, Windrunner. I should like to hear it\nfor myself.”\nKaladin gritted his teeth. So far, Nale had barely said a word to him. He\nwished he’d been better able to organize his own thoughts, because as he\nstepped up beside Nale—a man who was, unusually, about Kaladin’s height\n—he felt woefully unprepared.\n“Go ahead,” Nale said, striding with hands clasped behind him. “Speak\nto me of your ideas, mortal.”\nKaladin glanced around to see if Syl had returned from scouting, but she\nhadn’t. “I think,” he said, “this ‘follow the law’ thing you people have going\non is ridiculous.”\n“You are an anarchist?” Nale asked, his voice perfectly calm. “Tearing\ndown law and society, and making ash of them both?”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “But I don’t think you should worship it either.\nEvery rule needs to be broken now and then.”\n“Does it now?” Nale asked. “How do we decide? More importantly, who\ndecides?”\n“It depends,” Kaladin said.\n“Upon what?” Nale said. “Cannot every murderer say, ‘Mine is the\ninstance where the rule should be broken’? Every person has wanted to\nbreak the law—but if it is right for one to uphold it, then it is likewise right\nfor all. The great moralist Nohadon himself pointed out the need for such\nrules in society. Would you contradict him?”\n“I’m not arguing with him,” Kaladin said. “I don’t even want to argue\nwith you. I simply think that Szeth should think for himself a little more.”\n“I believe he is thinking for himself,” Nale said. “He has simply chosen\nanswers you do not like. Why is it that all proponents of ‘free thinking’ only\naccept the answers they want? Anyone who agrees with them is a free\nthinker. Anyone who doesn’t? Why, they must be blinded by the oppressive\nnorms of society, or are dancing on strings to the evil delight of those in\ncontrol.”\nThe passionless way he spoke, in a monotone aside from a stressed word\nhere and there, was unnerving.\n“Look,” Kaladin said, “can we please just talk about Szeth?”\n“We are talking about Szeth. And you are dodging questions. Do you\nthink people should follow the law?”\n“In general, sure. But the law isn’t perfect—it was made by a bunch of\npeople like us.”\n“That is all we have though. The law is the current best guideline to\nmorality for our society.”\n“Yeah, but that’s not how you present it to Szeth, is it?” Kaladin said,\nglancing back at the other man, who followed behind—silent, but obviously\nlistening intently. “Not some ‘guideline to morality’ but as an ideal to"

It’s one of his oaths!”\n“The oath,” Nale said, “is to find a moral compass. He selected a person.\nI find his choice questionable, but his decision is allowed and respected.”\n“Still. Sounds like you really do worship the law.”\n“Why shouldn’t we?” Nale said. “In nothing does mankind so closely\napproach the divine as in the creation of codes to better itself.”\n“I … don’t believe that. The law was worse than flawed for me, Nale. It\nlet a terrible man steal my brother and send him to war, to die. And while\nmy own slavery was probably illegal by Alethi law, what Sadeas did to my\nfriends—forming us into bridge crews and sending us to die on the\nShattered Plains—was perfectly legal and absolutely reprehensible. The law\ncan be, and often is, very broken.”\nNale shook his head. “And what replaces it?”\n“Human decency, maybe?”\n“Which is applied irregularly. The law doesn’t fix all ills, but it tries to—\nand you may have suffered, but you would have suffered more without the\nlaw. For humans cannot be trusted to be decent, Stormblessed. You should\nknow this more than most. Even my own viewpoint, I’ve come to learn, can\nbe flawed. The law, though, has been crafted over eons, handed down from\ngeneration to generation, refined and perfected.”\n“Except for those laws created at the whims of some idiot king. Which is\nmost of them.”\n“Why do you assume that you are smarter than the one who made the\nlaws?” Nale said. “From what the spren tells me, you don’t have any\nanswers—you don’t offer a better path. You simply tear down the one\noffered.”\n“But—”\n“Again, what would you have him do?” Nale said. “Other than ‘think for\nhimself’? Do you have a replacement for his idealization?”\n“I think he shouldn’t have one!”\n“So you want to replace something grand with nothing. The true goal of\nevery revolutionary. To tear down, rip apart, and destroy. You have no\nphilosophy to cherish, therefore you seek to ruin others’, jealous that they\nhave answers.\n“Well, I have answers,” Nale said. “The answer is to trust in the law,\nbecause at least then you have a moral compass. The ideas of men are weak\nthings, as are their hearts. Thus we pick something greater.”\n“But the law is the ideas of men!”\n“No,” Nale said. “There you are wrong. These laws are better than the\nmere ideas of men.”\n“But you just agreed that they are the thoughts of men!”\n“I did not. Tell me, do you know where the law of this land came from?”\nThis man … there were so many holes in his arguments, and he simply\nignored them. Nale said he was flawed, then proclaimed he had answers.\nStill, Szeth was listening—if Nale didn’t see the problems, perhaps Szeth\nwould.\n“Windrunner?” Nale asked. “Where did the law of this land originate?\nDo you know?”"

Let me explain.”\nKaladin felt himself being drawn into a trap, sure as he could sense a\nfeint coming in combat. He was no philosopher, unfortunately, and\nstruggled to find a way to avoid whatever Nale was planning. So he\nremained quiet.\nNale raised his hands to the sides in a sweeping gesture, taking in the\nlong brown-green grasses growing thigh-high, punctuated by stalks of giant\nflowers as tall as a man—with rigid stems almost like shells, and bright\nyellow petals surrounding a brown center, like an eye.\n“This land,” Nale continued, “was our first home upon this world. The\ncradle of humankind, where our first laws were forged. Not by spren or by\nmen, but by the hand of God himself and the monarch he had chosen:\nJezrien. King of Heralds, and Herald of Kings. My enemy, then my dear\nfriend. That divine origin is the foundation of law in Shinovar, Kaladin\nStormblessed. This is what you seek to undermine.”\n“But … wait,” Kaladin said. “Then why do the Shin worship the spren?”\n“Spren?” Nale said. “You mean literal fragments of divinity?”\n“Yeah, Syl says that, but … I mean …” He frowned. “Wait. This really\ndoesn’t add up. How did you Heralds find this world in the first place?”\n“We followed the sacred tones of Roshar,” Nale said. “We reached out\nthrough the power of Elsecalling—Ishar was once a master of that art. I had\nsome talent as well.” His expression grew wistful. “I heard it … the songs\nof a new world, fresh and alive. An inviting rhythm …”\n“Okay,” Kaladin said. “But were the spren involved? This place speaks\nto me sometimes. The Wind itself.”\n“Ignore that. Echoes of a god long dead and gone.”\n“But—”\n“We are off track,” Nale said. “Tell me: would you overthrow the entire\nShin system of government?”\n“What? Of course not.”\n“How would you react to another order of Radiants coming in, implying\nthat your oaths to protect are foolish?”\n“Look,” Kaladin said, tossing up his hands, getting frustrated. “It’s not\nworking for him. What you’re doing is hurting Szeth. I don’t argue like a\nscholar, Nale. But it’s not working. It’s broken. He needs help, compassion,\nand you’re not offering it.”\n“He is broken more than most,” Nale said, stopping on the road, meeting\nKaladin’s eyes. “You had a hand in that. Do you know who picked him up\noff the ground the day you left him to die in the storm, Kaladin\nStormblessed? Where was your compassion then?”\nWind gusted dust across the two of them as they stared eye to eye. “He\nwas actively trying to kill Dalinar,” Kaladin said."

They’d been forced to double back, after visiting a second empty\nmonastery the night before. Now he thought they were somewhere in the\nmiddle western portion of Shinovar. Near some mountains that bordered the\nwestern ocean. The … what had Szeth called it? The “big ocean”? No, that\nsounded silly. It was something like that though.\nThese western mountains here were lower than the ones on the east of\nShinovar, without frosted points, and had more mesas than peaks. The hot\nweather made Kaladin sticky with sweat as he put his hand to his eyes and\nsearched.\n“I don’t see it,” he said.\n“It’s ahead, hidden by the natural shape of the landscape,” Nale said.\n“You think the Lightweaver monastery would be easy to spot?”\nKaladin blushed, and glancing at Szeth, knew his arguments had failed.\nSzeth turned off the road and headed along a much smaller path to the side.\nHe wouldn’t meet Kaladin’s gaze.\nIt was unfair that convincing someone depended not on the strength of\nideas, but the strength of the arguer. Kaladin had always hated that, but\nagain, he didn’t have the eloquence to explain why. Instead he simmered as\nSzeth took up his weapon once more and—despite what he’d confessed he\nwanted—renewed his mission to kill.\nJasnah left the Thaylen strategy meeting with a gnawing anxiety, though the\nroot cause eluded her. At least her outfit was serving its purpose. The\nuniform had nods to her gender, with a fitted bodice and a high-buttoning\ncoat that was long in front and back, so it flowed a little like skirts, with\ntrousers and boots underneath. With the accompanying gloves, she could\nfight in this without trouble.\nShe’d become a model for many women Radiants, and had to be aware\n—at all times—that she was being watched. Granted, that had always been\ntrue—but at least now some who watched took her as a positive example.\n“The preparations,” Ivory’s voice said in her ear, “they are good, Jasnah.\nThe defense is.” He rode, as he often did, on her earring—she wore large\nseashell ones for him.\nBehind her, other generals and admirals left the conference room,\nchattering together. After an entire day planning for the defense of Thaylen\nCity, spirits were high. The Stonewards thought they could hide spikes of\nstone in the bay, to rip open hulls and sink ships. In addition, the\nartifabrians had developed counters to the Deepest Ones—fabrials that\ncould identify any Fused who came too close.

Indeed, this very morning, a special package\nhad arrived: several gemstones of precious anti-Voidlight, capable of ending\na Fused forever.\nThaylenah was as prepared as it possibly could be: the merchant city had\nessentially become a single giant fortress. With high cliffs to the sides—and\nno beachhead to allow access to the high ground behind—taking this port\nwould be a nightmare.\nAs the enemy knew.\nThey came anyway.\nJasnah reached an open window looking out over the city from a vantage\non the highest tier. Once, she might have found it restful here, with that blue\nshimmering ocean and the crisp, chill southern air.

As an inkspren, he tended to fixate on the present—the\nsituation as it was. It was a propensity, not an absolute, but he had found\nthat assessing the situation as it actually stood was the best way to solve a\nproblem.\nJasnah, on the other hand, tended to be focused on anything but the\npresent. Understanding the past, and how it informed the future, was her\nmandate as a Veristitalian—the one group of scholars who had embraced\nher as a young woman, when all others had found her heresy too polarizing\nto touch. Past and future were wed, but sometimes focusing on that left her\ntoo removed from the now.\n“Jasnah,” Ivory said, “you are concerned that what we perceive is not the\ntruth. That another reality is.”\n“Yes,” she said. “I am no expert in tactics, but I concur with what the\ngenerals, Radiants, and admirals are saying. The city is impregnable. So …”\n“So you worry we are wrong.” Ivory thought for a moment. “Perhaps\nwhat they need is not another general, Jasnah. Perhaps this time they need a\nscholar.”\nShe immediately felt like a fool. If she was going to prove her value to\nthis group, it wouldn’t be through tactical acumen. She was better with\nmilitary strategy than the average person, but the minds in that room were\namong the best in the world. She would have to spend years studying before\nshe could be their equal.\nBut if she was right, this was a logic problem, not a military one.

        "text": "did Odium break an unbreakable city?\nShe needed paper and a quiet space to think.\nImmediately.\nBoth have as much detail as I can remember. My life. My reign.\nMy sorrow. My glory.\n—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar Kholin\nSzeth had no particular affinity for the Lightweavers. Though he’d trained\nwith their arts by requirement, he hated the way they made comedy out of\ntruth, practically worshipping lies.\nAs he walked the final path to the monastery, however, he found himself\nwondering. He’d imagined Lightweavers as strange beings who turned the\ntruth into whatever they wanted it to be. But perhaps re-forming the truth\ninto what you wanted it to be was not a trait merely of liars, but of all\nhuman beings.\nThis smaller path off the main road descended a gradual slope. He\nwalked it alongside Nin—or Nale, as he referred to himself—with Kaladin\nand Sylphrena behind. Szeth felt lonely. His spren had stopped talking to\nhim except to issue stiff commands. Nightblood spent his days chatting with\nthe Honorblades. Kaladin and Nale argued. Did they care about Szeth, or\nmerely about proving one another wrong? Dared he think such thoughts\nabout a holy being such as Nin-son-God?\nSzeth glanced over his shoulder at the two men. Blue uniform and black.\nThe man who had left him to die, and the man who had saved him. The man\nwho claimed to care for Szeth, and the one who only cared about the law. A\npiece of him was angry at them both for pulling him between them.\nMaybe that as well was simply life. To be pulled between two partial\ntruths. Sivi had tried so hard to get him to accept that, and he’d always\nresisted. For if life was about partial truths as much as it was about singular\nones, then all other aspects of his existence became extremely messy.\nHe wished dearly for the sweet, clean truths of Nin’s path. Even if it\nrequired him to kill.\nSzeth? Nightblood’s voice. Are you all right?\n“Sword-nimi?” Szeth whispered, shifting the group of swords on his\nback. He carried half, and Kaladin had the other half strapped to his pack.\nThey were heavy—lighter than they should be, but not inconsequential.\n“No need for concern.”\nIt’s just … I felt something from you.\n“Felt it?” Szeth said. “How can you feel what I do?”\nI don’t know. I feel close to you. You hurt.\n“I always hurt.”\nShouldn’t that … go away? Human pains fade, don’t they?\n“I should very much like it to be so, sword-nimi. But I do not think I\ndeserve such peace.”\nYou said you weren’t going to kill anymore.\n“I should like that as well,” Szeth said, turning right and starting down\nsome steps that were hidden by the rolling brown landscape. Made of logs\nand stakes pounded into the earth, worn by time and footsteps, they led into\na small ravine that opened up as two hills met, a stream cutting between\nthem.\nSzeth? the sword asked. Are you evil?\n“Why do you ask?” he whispered. “Before, you said you were sure that I\nwasn’t.”"

        "text": "them.\nSzeth? the sword asked. Are you evil?\n“Why do you ask?” he whispered. “Before, you said you were sure that I\nwasn’t.”\nWell, I’ve been listening. More, I’ve been trying to remember, which is\nsometimes hard. You talk about the burdens you carry. The people you’ve\nkilled. Innocents, you say. And … killing innocents is evil. Isn’t it?\n“Yes.”\nBut when you saved Dalinar and the Radiants, that was good, wasn’t it?\n“I hope so.”\nI was created, and I was given a simple purpose. Destroy evil. I figured I\nwould find the men who were evil and destroy them. That’s what Nale\nwants, isn’t it? To separate people into groups. Evil. Not evil.\n“That is too simple, even for his philosophy,” Szeth whispered, reaching\nthe bottom of the steps. “He points out that all people are sometimes good,\nsometimes evil. It’s impossible for us to separate the two—therefore, we\nneed a guideline.”\nShouldn’t it be easy to tell what is good and evil?\n“We all pretend that it is,” Szeth said. “But if it were, then we would not\ndisagree so much.” He walked into the ravine, with water trickling in from\nthe brook to his right. “We almost all agree on the basics. Killing an\ninnocent is evil. But what if it’s to save three innocents? What if you are an\ninstrument, following what you thought was a higher law? What if you take\na good action, it goes poorly, and innocents die?”\nThose seem like uncommon cases.\n“If only, sword-nimi. If only.”\nThe ravine opened up to reveal the monastery. Cut into the rock, its stone\nface stained by the water dripping from above. Szeth had seen the chasms at\nthe Shattered Plains, and this was different. For one, it was far more open to\nthe sky. And while the stream here gave some fertility—letting small trees\nspring up—it wasn’t filled with such a determined swelling of plant life as\nthe chasms.\nThis was a quiet, contemplative corner in a windswept land. He studied\nit, and worried. Not just about his earlier concerns, but about the Voice. He\nknew he’d eventually have to face it. He thought that loosening its grip on\nhis land, by killing the Honorbearers, was a good way to proceed. But when\nthose battles were over, then what?\nCould he fight an Unmade? Dalinar hadn’t been able to. He’d had to\ndefeat it through force of will, refusing the lure of the Thrill it offered—but\nalso, as he’d described in his book, by acknowledging what they shared.\nDid something similar await Szeth?\nHe didn’t know. Thus he did what he could; and that meant cleansing\nthis land. He strode toward the monastery, which had—instead of a city or\neven a garrison to support it—only a few homes for keepers and servants.\nAll empty, Szeth quickly determined.\nExiting one of them, he passed Kaladin and Nin. “Szeth,” Kaladin said,\ntrying to take him by the arm. “There must be another way.”\nSzeth stopped, allowing Kaladin to seize him—making the man feel silly"

Kaladin walked up to the\ndoorway to watch, but Nin took him by the shoulder.\n“He must fulfill the pilgrimage without your help, Windrunner,” the\nHerald said. “Do not interfere.”\nThe inside of this monastery was darker than the others. Lit by a skylight\nfar above, in the roof of the three-story grand hall. A column of sunlight\nstreamed down upon a group of thirty women standing in rows, wearing the\nsame face.\nSzeth halted in place, Shardblade out. Waiting. “Moss-son-Farrier?” he\ncalled. “I … would not fight you, if I do not have to.”\n“Then you should not have come in.” Moss’s voice echoed from farther\nin the chamber. “I had thought I’d never see you again, Szeth. I miss the old\ntimes between us.”\nSzeth hesitantly took a step forward. Those rows of people were all\nwearing the same colorful gown. They looked like …\nLike the Herald, he thought. Shush-daughter-God, the Lightweaver.\nYes. He’d met the Herald in real life, and this was an approximation of\nher. These weren’t thirty individual women, but thirty illusions of the\nmonastery’s patron Herald.\nSticking to the darkened perimeter of the room, Szeth crept closer. Each\nof the illusions looked identical to the others. All the figures stood perfectly\nstill, gazing at him.\n“Show yourself, Moss,” Szeth said.\n“I have,” Moss replied, his voice coming from the ranks of illusory\nwomen. Szeth was watching the faces of those closest, and they did not\nspeak. But … a skilled Lightweaver could warp and bend the air to create\nsound. “I am hidden before you, in this light, as one of these versions of\nShush.”\n“Can’t we simply duel?” Szeth said.\n“Duel?” Moss said with a laugh. “You think I’d have any kind of chance,\nSzeth?”\nSzeth continued to walk around the circle of light.\n“You know we don’t put much stock in fighting,” Moss continued.\nIt was true. Sometimes, a Lightweaver was even chosen through a\ncontest of illusions—though if one was as stubborn as Moss’s predecessor\nhad been, swordplay became needed. The Bondsmith Honorbearer also was\nchosen irregularly, by vote.\n“So instead of a duel you make a game?” Szeth called. “One of your\nridiculous puzzles?”\n“My part ends when you pick one of me to kill,” Moss said. “Almost all\nof the illusions before you are imperfect in some way. One is me, hidden\nbehind a face that is instead perfect. Twenty-nine of those standing here are\ninnocuous; one of those standing here is deadly.

Now is the last I\nwill speak to you. Choose carefully.”\nSzeth sighed, dismissing his Shardblade for now. He trusted his mastery\nof the Blade against anyone other than a Herald, but his mind? He … did\nnot trust that. No, not with those voices in the eaves.\nHe would have to do his best anyway. For it was what was required of\nhim, and he did as he was required.\nVenli led the way through the chasms of the Shattered Plains, guiding\ntwenty of her people—and several chasmfiends, who followed farther\nbehind—toward a hidden song she’d barely begun to be able to hear.\nThey’d entered the chasms from the east, a method she’d never used\nbefore. In the past, during her childhood, she’d always entered the chasms\nby jumping, or climbing from above, usually following Eshonai on some\nchild’s quest. She remembered those days with a smile. Back before she’d\ngrown jealous of her sister, before Venli had been trapped memorizing\nsongs while her sister wasted time.\nShe attuned Peace. That wasn’t the right way to think of it, was it?\nVenli paused at an intersection to look at her people trailing behind—a\ngroup that included several of her companions from Urithiru, who had left\nwith her: Dul, Mazish, and Shumin. There was also a larger number of\noriginal listeners, and finally Leshwi and her Heavenly Ones. A calm stream\nflowed through the chasm, avoidable for the most part by walking next to\nthe wall. The flow would probably grow more furious as they approached\nthe storm, but she hoped it wouldn’t become so bad they were forced out of\nthe chasms. The Everstorm didn’t dump nearly as much rain as the\nhighstorm commonly did.\nShe spun and walked through a swarm of lifespren, passing a stone in the\nshape of a tree branch. A lonely stick had been ripped free in the wind and\nended up here—where, over time, crem had coated it. Such shapes tended\nto be hollow—she could step on it and crack it straight through, because the\noriginal wood had rotted away, leaving this shell.\nThoughts could turn to stone the same way. In her memories, she’d been\n“forced” to sit and train—but how true was that? She’d practiced because\nshe’d loved the songs, loved learning, and loved spending time with her\nmother. Her resentment was because she hadn’t felt appreciated, not\nbecause of the work itself.\nAnd her sister? Her sister had been doing what their people needed, even\nif Venli hadn’t been able to recognize it. Continuing to nurture that nugget\nof resentment was like taking a stick and coating it in crem—if she wasn’t"

Continuing to nurture that nugget\nof resentment was like taking a stick and coating it in crem—if she wasn’t\ncareful, the truth would rot away inside. She’d be left with hollow lies.\nShe instead brought to mind different memories: of beautiful evenings\nsinging what she’d learned to Eshonai, both of them staring across the\nShattered Plains and laughing together. Inwardly, she attuned Peace, and\nthen Awe. She was in a wondrous location. She should enjoy this chasm and\nits vibrant ecosystem.\nThe thick, wet air reminded her of the first whiff of a cup of tea, fat with\nsteam and the smell of herbs. Vines trailed down the sides of the chasm, and\nshalebark sprouted in a hundred vibrant varieties. The fan-shaped yellow\nones to her right clung to the wall, each looking like a book that was being\nriffled open.\nAt her feet, cremlings scuttled among forests that had to be enormous to\nthem, but that to Venli were each like a tiny diorama. The kind that Kunona\nused to make, each little piece of stone or tiny plant carefully arranged.\nKunona had … died during the birth of the Everstorm. Venli glanced up\nat the dark sky, visible through the slit top of the chasm high above. Red\nflashes reflected off clouds up there. By moving inward, they entered his\ndomain.\nShe still heard that rhythm in the distance. The one she was following.\nThe closer they drew, the better Venli could pick out the tone—somehow\ndiscordant, with a chaotic rhythm. To her right, a purple cremling sat atop a\nbulbous frond. It seemed to be watching her, and she hummed a happy\nrhythm to it.\nSoon, Thude stepped up next to her, holding a gemstone for light, his\nfoot crunching softly on a rotten log, the pieces getting caught in the current\nand floating back alongside the group. “Venli,” he said to Anxiety. “Are you\nsure about this course? The Everstorm is that way.”\n“Likely parked and paused,” she said. “He’s done it before—moved the\nstorm where he wants it to frighten and dominate the humans.” She\nhesitated. “A battle is taking place there, Thude. Humans and singers fight\nover Narak. I told you what Rlain sent me? The contract the human king\nhas with Odium, and the strange terms that let them keep what they gain\nthese ten days?”\n“So much blood spilled,” Thude whispered to Mourning, “for a barren\nstretch of broken stone. The humans spent years murdering listeners there,\nand now others kill over it again.”\nShe hummed to the Lost, and … found it sad how solemn he’d become.\nThat was partially her fault.\nMostly her fault.\n“I’m sorry, Thude,” she whispered. “For everything.”\n“I keep thinking maybe she survived somehow, Venli. That someday\nEshonai will walk back into our camp. When you first returned … I thought\n… I thought it was her. For just a moment. Is that foolish of me?”\n“Hope is not foolish,” she said, with a wince, “but Thude … I saw\nEshonai’s corpse. I’m sorry. I should have mentioned it. But you know"

But you know\nTimbre was her spren first.”\nHe glanced at her, humming to Appreciation. He wanted her to explain.\n“I was sent with Demid,” Venli said, “to collect my sister’s Shards after\nshe died. Thude, Odium didn’t care about her. Eshonai was disposable to\nhim. I think that’s when I started to change. That day when we found her,\nand I realized all anyone cared about was her armor …”\nTimbre thrummed inside her. Comforting. Then added something\ncurious.\n“Thude,” Venli said, “Timbre says Eshonai wasn’t his when she died.\nShe’d broken free.”\n“She was stormform,” Thude said. “Is that possible?”\n“I was able to do it, but only with Timbre’s help. Timbre says … Eshonai\ndid it too. She cast him out of her mind and was herself when she died. We\ncan fight him.”\nBehind the line of listeners, she could see one of the larger shadows\nprowling the chasm. They had insisted on coming. Five chasmfiends,\nincluding the one everyone called Thundercloud, their leader. Or he was the\nfirst who had decided not to fight any longer—and when the largest and\nmost dangerous of them decided the little things on the Shattered Plains had\ndefeated him, the others had followed.\n“Perhaps we can do something,” Venli said, “about the conflict\nhappening ahead of us, Thude. Perhaps we should join the fighting, as I\nsuggested before.”\n“No.”\nShe held up a gemstone to illuminate his face.\n“Venli,” he said, “we will not fight. I’ve decided to trust you again, but\nyou do not lead us. We number barely a thousand adults. The chasmfiends’\nnumbers are worse. Not much more than a hundred individuals? I get the\nsense that they are dwindling fast. They will have difficulty breeding if too\nmany more die. We will stay out of this fight.”\n“Our numbers are my fault. If I hadn’t—”\n“Venli, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but … let go. It’s done. We all\nregret what happened. But … an evil god was bent on our destruction. I’m\ntrying not to hate you. It will help us both if we can move on.”\nShe sighed, but he was right—both about her, and about not fighting.\nShe doubted they’d ever have gone with her on this trek if the spren hadn’t\nspoken and the chasmfiends hadn’t confirmed the existence of that strange\ntone.\n“No fighting,” she said to Thude. “I’m glad you and the Five came. Any\ndecision we make, of course, will be yours.”\nHe hummed to Determination. They’d left Jaxlim behind, as she and\nVenli—as keepers of the songs—couldn’t both be risked at the same time.\nBut all of the Five had come, after appointing others to take their places if\nthey didn’t return.

It would still take a great while to reach the\ncenter, hiking through these twisting chasms in secret—but traveling the\nplateaus above would be suicide, with Heavenly Ones and Windrunners\npatrolling.\nOnly down here were they safe, within the darkness and the writhing\nplants.

And even if he were not,\nI would find his actions increasingly suspect.\n—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar Kholin\nSzeth finished his circuit of the pool of light in the Lightweaver monastery,\ncalm sun from above falling on those thirty illusory figures. How would he\npick out the right one? Looking closely, he spotted tiny differences between\nthe figures: hair parted differently, eyes different colors, sashes on dresses\nforming different bows.\nHe studied each one, and sweat began to drip down his face. He couldn’t\ntell which was “perfect” and which was not. Storms … how could he ever\nbeat a Lightweaver at their own tricks? He could come to only one\nconclusion. He should strike randomly and trust in fate. He summoned his\nBlade, and knew he would fail.\n“Hmmm …” a feminine voice said in his ear.\nHe glanced to the side and saw nothing.\n“Yeah,” Syl whispered, “tricky Lightweavers with their tricky ways.\nWell, if your spren won’t help, I will.”\n“You … shouldn’t be here,” Szeth whispered.\n“Nale said Kaladin can’t help you, but he didn’t say anything about me.\nI’m a god, aren’t I? Piece of one?”\n“Of course.”\n“Do you not pray to gods for help?”\n“Yes.”\n“So …”\nHe thought barely a moment. “Will you please help?”\n“Gladly,” she whispered. “Keep your voice down, don’t mention my\nname, and let them assume you’re talking to your spren.”\n“Follow the rules though. Don’t touch them.”\n“Fine, fine. Let’s walk along this row here. Hmmm … They’re each\ndifferent. Just barely.”\n“We’re to find which one is perfect. But how do we know which is the\n‘perfect’ representation of a Herald? Half have green eyes, half have\nviolet.”\n“Exactly half and half?”\nHe considered, then counted. “Sixteen violet. Fourteen green.”\n“That seems deliberate. Can we infer something from that? Quick, count\nhow many have their hair parted on the left, and how many on the right.”\nHe did so.

Same with bows—sixteen tied in\nan extravagant knot, fourteen in a simple one.\n“So,” Syl said, “do we think the ‘correct’ Ash will have the more\ncommon trait, or the less common one?”\n“Perfection is rare,” he said, “so the less common one?”\nHe disliked guessing when it involved something this important … but\nhe supposed he’d been ready to strike randomly. Syl’s aid eased his tension,\nand he found himself exceptionally grateful for it. Together the two talked it\nover, and through a process of elimination found one version of Shush who\nhad each of the most rare traits. Green eyes, part on the left, bow a simple\nknot, ring on her finger … all the way through the various attributes.\nThey stopped in front of this one, the third from the left in the back row.\nSzeth prepared his sword.\nThen hesitated. What was wrong?\n“Does this …” Syl said in his ear, “feel too easy to you?”\n“It does.”\n“Do you know much about the person who set this up?”\n“Yes.”\n“And what kind of person are they?”\n“Too smart,” Szeth said. “And sure of their cleverness. Like most\nLightweavers I’ve met.”\nSyl thought a moment. “Yeah, there’s a zero percent chance we solved\nthe riddle this easily. I’d bet my left ear—I’ve never liked that one—that we\nare supposed to choose this illusion. Not because it’s right, but because it’s\nthe most obvious choice.”\n“Then what do we do?” Szeth whispered.\n“We need to go a layer deeper,” Syl said. “We need to discard obvious\nchoices.”\n“Then how will we ever know?” Szeth asked, walking to the end of the\nrow, then peering down the line of near-identical versions of the demigod.\n“Moss is smarter than I am. He’ll have considered every option.”\n“I’m thinking …”\n“Their faces have small moles,” Szeth said, walking back down the line.\n“Maybe we find the one without such a blemish? Except I find that too\nobvious as well.”\n“Yeah,” Syl said, “and not even really accurate. What about a mole\nmakes someone less perfect? That’s another way for us to assume we’ve\ncracked the code, only to lose. I think.”\nHer uncertainty mirrored his own. Whatever solution he pondered … it\nseemed flimsy, surface-level. Finding the one Shush who was out of step\nwith the others? Finding the one that had her head straight, when others\nwere cocked slightly? Any of these could be the solution, but how did that\nmake them intrinsically any less perfect?\nKnowing Moss …\n“He’ll want to win no matter what choice I make,” Szeth said. “That’s\nthe kind of puzzle this is, isn’t it? The kind he can’t lose, no matter which\noption I choose.”\n“Aaaah …” Syl said. “You’re almost certainly right, Szeth. What exactly\ndid he say at the start?”\n“He said almost all of the illusions were imperfect in some way. But one\nwas him, hidden behind a face that was instead perfect.” He paused. “He"

It’s not a riddle if you couldn’t conceivably find the answer. Hmm\n… just a second.” A moment later she said, “Fly up above them, Szeth.\nLet’s see if they make an interesting pattern.”\nHe Lashed himself into the air, in front of the skylight, casting a shadow\non those below. Together he and Syl studied the array of five rows of six.\n“I don’t see anything,” Szeth said.\n“You trained with this Lightweaver, didn’t you? Is there some clue in\nyour training?”\n“It was a long time ago,” Szeth said. “And I was never very good at it.”\nYet it would be just like Moss to reference some idle bit of instruction, these\nmany years later. “I was taught,” he said after mulling it over, “that one\ntheme of Lightweaving is subterfuge. It’s not about perfection, as no\nillusion can be perfect. He and I agreed on that. So all of those illusions are\nimperfect, by their nature.”\n“But he stated he was one of the figures,” Syl said.\n“Well, he said he was hiding behind one of the versions of Shush. ‘One\nis me, hidden behind a face that is instead perfect …’”\nHe gazed down from this lofty position, and saw it. As in the other\nmonasteries, there was an old mural on the floor depicting one of the\nHeralds. Here, the face of Shush. Set upon stone. That which was perfect.\n“Storms,” Syl said. “The floor!”\nSzeth needed no further proof. He summoned his Blade and dropped,\nstabbing straight into the floor tiles, right through the eye.\n“Szeth!” Syl said in his ear. “That was impulsive!”\n“You saw it as I did,” he said, watching as the Lightweavings of the\nfigures broke apart, revealing a group of exhausted, bleary-eyed, and\nsomewhat dazed acolytes.\nAcolytes? Szeth thought. He used people behind the faces of Shush?\nWhy? That seemed particularly brutal of Moss. If Szeth had struck one of\nthose, he’d have killed them.\n“We could have talked it through or something,” Syl said, remaining\ninvisible as she spoke into his ear.\n“And given him time to realize we’d figured it out?” Szeth said, looking\ndown at the floor—which he sliced apart, opening a dug-out section in the\nstone beneath the mural. Moss’s clothing lay inside; upon being stabbed,\nhe’d evaporated into darkness like the others, leaving his Blade. Szeth cut\nthrough enough stone to pick that up: a Blade with wave patterns along the\nback, and a round hole in the pommel.\n“I still think it was a little brash,” Syl said.\n“Sometimes,” Szeth said, hefting the sword, “you simply have to make a\ndecision.”\nAs Kaladin and Nin approached, he realized that those words were"

        "text": "“Sometimes,” Szeth said, hefting the sword, “you simply have to make a\ndecision.”\nAs Kaladin and Nin approached, he realized that those words were\nabsolutely true.\nJasnah found a peaceful place to think in an unlikely location. A temple.\nWhen her uncle, Dalinar, had been in this city, he’d used his powers to\nrestore an ancient temple. Jasnah still didn’t understand how he’d managed\nit; the Bondsmith powers worked so oddly. Granted, each Radiant order was\nproving that their specific applications of the Surges could be unusual, but\nBondsmiths were on another level entirely.\nThe restored temple to Talenelat was now viewed as a holy site beyond\neven others in Thaylen City, and it was reserved for Radiants to use. As her\nrooms in the city had, by her request, been placed near those of the other\ngenerals … well, if she wanted somewhere quiet, this was perfect. No one\nwould bother her in this solemn circular chamber, decorated with murals\nand stone glyphwards praising the Almighty.\nJasnah set up at the rear of the chamber, between two pillars and near a\nrelief depicting Taln, the Bearer of Agonies. They mostly got his features\nright. A surgical table and chairs had been placed here, as this room was\nused for healings when an Edgedancer or Truthwatcher was in the city.\nShe set her notebooks and papers on the surgical table, but did not sit. An\nelectric current seemed to run through her, like the kind one could create\nwith that old experiment using brine-soaked cloths and different kinds of\nmetals. Caged lightning. During a scientific summit in her youth, she’d seen\na researcher use that process to make the muscles of a cremling twitch after\nit was dead.\nShe walked around the surgery table, her mind buzzing. Odium knew\nthis city could not be broken without extreme loss of life. Indeed, even with\nextreme loss of life, he would almost certainly fail here. Thaylen City was\nbarely worth attacking. Yet he was coming with large numbers, and was\ngiving himself only a couple of days to capture the city.\nWhat was she missing?\nWhat were they all missing?\nIvory grew to full size, hand on his dueling sword, watching her with\nobvious amusement. He stood by the doors, lounging—a figure entirely of\ninky-black marble, with an oil-on-water iridescence when the light hit just\nright.\nHe gave her space and quiet to think. Unfortunately, now that she was\nhere … she found answers elusive. She wrote down logical questions to\nconsider, as prescribed by her formal training, drawing a swarm of\nlogicspren like little thunderclouds.\nEach idea led to answers that felt wrong. Emotional Core Theory taught\nher to look toward what drove participants: What emotions might be\ncausing them to act as they did? Was there an intangible, emotional reason\nthat Odium wanted this city? Perhaps failing to take it a year ago still\nrankled, and so he’d come for vengeance.\nYet this was a new Odium—and while the power might want vengeance,\nwho knew what the new Vessel wanted? She was on shaky ground to\nassume she could reason their motives. Plus, she’d never liked assuming\nthat her opponents were making mistakes. Yes, it was important to"

        "text": "who knew what the new Vessel wanted? She was on shaky ground to\nassume she could reason their motives. Plus, she’d never liked assuming\nthat her opponents were making mistakes. Yes, it was important to\nrecognize and exploit missteps, but underestimating foes was a bad habit\nthat led to worse surprises. If you instead assumed your enemies were\nmaking the right decisions—and you countered them anyway—then you\nwere often led to important realizations.\nAssuming competence from her enemy, what was her next step? Perhaps\nformalist theory: lay out your premises and try to construct the next logical\nmove. However, that felt too much like what they’d been doing with the\ngenerals—they could plan for eventualities better than she could. She\nneeded to uncover what they weren’t seeing.\nThis led her to economic theory. It taught her to follow the incentives.\nWere there intangibles to be gained by attacking here? Storms. Was Odium\nsimply diverting their forces? Drawing their limited resources away from\nbattles that could be lost, instead committing them to a fight they were\nalready likely to win?\nThat seemed a useful hypothesis. She sat and explored it, writing notes,\nas logicspren swirled around her hand. Fen was one of their two strongest\nallies. She was also loud and brash, and demanded help for a city that had\nalready been through so much. The coalition was more likely to devote\nresources to Thaylen City so that it didn’t have to rebuild a second time. Yes\n… all this could lead them to overcommit to defending this city.\nCould this attack actually be a way to make certain the other two assault\npoints—Azimir and the Shattered Plains—were denied resources? Here, she\nfound problems with her premise. If your goal was merely to divert forces\nfrom other battles, then why would you divert your own forces in the same\nway?\nPerhaps these were troops that couldn’t be used elsewhere? No … those\nforces could have sailed through Shadesmar to Azimir, right? Maybe there\nweren’t mandras available to pull ships that far in time? And what about the\nShattered Plains? With the Everstorm blowing them, could the enemy have\ndelivered these troops to that battlefield in time?\nShe did calculations, and felt she might be on to something. But after an\nhour of thinking, looking up numbers, and writing out her thoughts … she\nwas beginning to hit a wall.\n“Ivory,” she said, “distract me.”\nHe was used to this. “A temple,” he said from where he stood at full size\nnear the doorway. “You come to a temple to think?”\n“It’s quiet. And beautiful.”\n“Even after all these years,” he said, “I do not always understand the\nperson you are, Jasnah. Shouldn’t this place make you angry? You deny the\ndivinity at the very foundation of its religion. You deny the faith of the\npeople who built it.”\n“Small quibble,” she said, “but I do not deny that the people who built\nthis had faith. Nor do I deny that faith’s power to inspire.”\n“But you are in opposition to their god.”\n“A larger quibble,” she said. “I’m not in opposition to their god, because\ntheir god—as they imagine him, all-powerful and all-knowing—does not"

I can no more be in opposition to that than I am to an imaginary\nchildhood friend—you cannot wrestle with, fight, or oppose something that\ndoes not exist. I oppose the assumptions that people make. Because if you\nstart with faulty assumptions …”\nWell, Damnation.\nFaulty assumptions.\nShe’d forgotten a basic tenet of any logical dissection: examine your\npremises. What were hers? She held up a finger to stall Ivory, who—again\n—was used to this sort of thing.\nPremise One: That Odium truly wanted to take this city. That appeared\nreasonable, from all they knew.\nPremise Two: That the city was well-defended. This seemed a strong\npremise—at least, she trusted the admirals and generals.\nWhat else? What was she missing?\nIt hit her like thunder.\nPremise Three: she wrote. That there are actually storming troops\ncoming this way.\nIn a cold sweat, she saw their mistake. Ships coming this direction didn’t\nmean troops. Even if scout reports had seen people crowding the decks,\nimplying far more people underneath … that didn’t mean there were troops\non the way. Fen had been shocked the enemy had been able to raise an army\nto assault her city. What if he hadn’t? What if he had ships—the navy from\nVedenar, and stolen ships from Thaylen City itself—and people to dress up\nin costumes … but no actual troops? What would he do in that situation?\nHe’d send a fleet this way. Slowly. To make his enemies dig in, divert\nresources … and wait for an army that wasn’t really coming.\nShe stood up, her eyes wide.\n“You have it,” Ivory said. “The answer is?”\n“The hypothesis is. I need our Windrunner scouts to do something\npotentially dangerous, but potentially vital.” She looked up. “I need them to\nget very, very close to those ships.”\nI realize this is, in a way, ridiculous. I, who proclaim a god to be\ndead, am also the one who rejects the idea that no God exists.\nAnd yet my very being—soul, mind, body—rebels at the idea that\nnothing out there cares. It must.\n—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar Kholin\nWhile Szeth recovered some gemstones from a stash here in the monastery,\nSylphrena appeared again beside Kaladin—human size, because it felt right.\nShe regarded the collection of acolytes who had been standing with\nillusions over them. People. Moss had used real people in his test. How\nunnecessarily cruel. Illusions didn’t need a person to stick to; Shallan made\nthem freestanding all the time.\nOnce Szeth returned with the infused gemstones, Syl floated with him\nand Kaladin out to the front of the monastery. There, Nale glanced at her.\nGlared? He wasn’t frowning. Could you glare without a frown? Perhaps she\nshould ask some angerspren.\nShe smiled at Nale.

Especially the ones where it made someone\nannoyed.\nSzeth studied his newly won Honorblade, pausing on the stone porch\noutside the monastery. Behind, in the hall, the poor acolytes began to\nstumble and hug one another, freed from the darkness. Kaladin squatted by\nSzeth as he unwrapped their increasingly bulky pack of swords, then slid\nthis new one in among them—and Nightblood quietly asked it if it could\nbecome dull for their travels.\n“I’m impressed,” Kaladin said to Szeth. “How did you figure out that\nriddle?”\n“I had the blessings of the spren,” Szeth said.\nNale—standing with hands clasped behind himself like a giant stone\nstatue—glared at her even more intently. How strange, this feeling. That of\nperking up beneath a glare. Ruining that man’s day was basically the best\nthing ever.\nExcept … why did her mind keep drifting back to that oddity of using\nservants behind the illusions? Stupid brain. It couldn’t let go of ideas\nsometimes, and other times it was so full of silly ideas, it couldn’t pick one.\nSzeth had won.\nExcept …\nTo win this test, the Lightweaver had said, you must choose a version of\nme, strike with your Blade through the eye, and kill me. Then you must\nescape my monastery with my Blade.\nThen you must escape with my Blade …\n“Well,” Kaladin said. “I’m glad it wasn’t me in there. I think I’d have\ngone mad.”\n“No,” Syl said, forcing herself back to the moment, and crouched down\nbeside him near the Blades. “Your spren would have helped you. Which is\nhow the bond is supposed to work. We both give, and we both get. A\nsymbiosis, like the pictures that Shallan showed me of cremlings.”\n“What do cremlings have to do with this?” Kaladin said, frowning.\n“Everything,” Syl said.\nSzeth tied the bundle of cloth-wrapped swords, then stood up as people\nbegan to flood out of the monastery, falling to their knees, weeping. As in\nother places they’d visited. It felt more … intimate here, in this little\nchasmlike ravine, with the stream trickling behind Nale.\nThese people surrounded Szeth on the open rock patio in front of the\nmonastery. A location that felt a lot like ordinary Roshar, with stone on the\nground, almost no mud or dirt. A holy place, although why the spren of\nrocks got so much devotion here was beyond her. Rock spren were almost\nas stupid as stick spren, and that was saying something.\nThough the stone itself has ancient memories, she thought. Of a land that\nonce knew the touch of neither human nor singer …\nKaladin stood up, smiling at Szeth. He liked this part, she knew, because\nit reminded Szeth that he was fighting for something. Because ideals were\nstupid unless there were people behind them.

So strange that an entire order\nof Radiants didn’t understand that.\nSyl wanted to flit off into the air and go looking for lifespren, as she\nthought some might be here in this almost-right place with the stream and\nthe trees.\nBut her brain. Her stupid brain.\nHer brain kept thinking about Moss. He’d thought himself so smart, and\nnow he was dead. So there.\nHer brain latched on. Like with jaws.\nHolding. Tight. Squeezing.\nTwenty-nine of those standing here are innocuous; one of those standing\nhere is deadly. Twenty-nine posed no threat, but one of those standing was\ndeadly. The Lightweaver hadn’t been standing; he’d been lying down.\nShe looked at Szeth, with his too-shiny, too-hairless head. Twenty-nine\nof the people standing weren’t dangerous … but was one of them deadly\nstill? Someone who made a riddle like this seemed the type who would try\nto get the wording exactly right. Would he also be the type to hide two\nriddles in one?\nThis is your true test …\nSyl bolted upright, then grabbed Kaladin by the arm. Actually grabbed\nhim. With full force.\nHe glanced at her, shocked.\n“Kaladin,” Syl hissed. “One of those acolytes is going to try to kill\nSzeth.”\nHe blinked, took it in.\nAnd trusted her.\nWithout a moment’s hesitation, Kaladin summoned the spear. She went,\nher substance flowing into the weapon, her awareness becoming his. In\nthose moments she overlapped with him, saw through his eyes. It wasn’t\nexact. She had an awareness that wasn’t precisely his.\nNever were they closer than in these moments when Kaladin—bless him\n—just trusted her. He took the spear in two hands and saw it. A flash in the\nair as one of the people fawning over Szeth—a matronly woman—\nsummoned a Blade, raised her arms to strike at Szeth’s back …\nAnd was speared straight through the ear by Kaladin.\nHer eyes burned and she collapsed. Around them, people cried out and\nscattered.\nSzeth, belatedly, spun around.\n“Cheating,” Nale said, his voice calm. “The Windrunner has helped\nyou.”\nSzeth stared at the dead woman, who evaporated into smoke. He knelt\nreverently and picked up her Blade: long and curved, with an intricate\ndesign near the hilt. “The Truthwatcher Honorbearer? I don’t know her.\nWhat of Vambra-daughter-Skies? She was so young …”\nSzeth blinked, then looked to Kaladin, who looked to Syl, who appeared\nfull sized as Kaladin dismissed his spear.\n“Two Honorbearers attacked you last time,” she said. “And so I thought,\n‘Huh. Why would they send only one this time?’ And then I thought,\n‘Szeth’s head is funny without hair.’ But then I thought, ‘Hey. The\nLightweaver said that twenty-nine of the illusions standing there weren’t\ndangerous.’ And … um … the rest just fell into place.” She shrugged.\n“You knew about this?” Kaladin said, spinning toward Nale."

The\nrules have been violated.”\n“What rules?” Szeth said softly.\nSyl turned slowly, Kaladin doing likewise, to where Szeth knelt holding\nthe new Honorblade. The air was strangely quiet, now that the servants of\nthe monastery had fled. Szeth looked up and met Nale’s eyes.\n“What rules did I violate,” Szeth said, “Nin-son-God?”\n“The rules of pilgrimage.”\n“When Pozen drew me into Shadesmar …” Szeth whispered, “I asked\nabout the rules. He said that there are no set rules for this challenge. If there\nwere, I could not have been attacked by two Honorbearers at a time.\nCorrect?”\nNale did not reply.\n“Nor could I have been attacked outside the boundaries of the monastery\nitself.” Szeth stood and nodded to Kaladin. “This man has been assigned to\nhelp me. As he did his job, and since there are no rules for this pilgrimage\n… I do not see how any could have been violated. Sir.”\nSyl whistled softly at the complete lack of emotion in Szeth’s voice. The\ntwo faced one another, black uniform and white. Until Nale spoke.\n“You are correct and I was wrong,” Nale said. “The pilgrimage\ncontinues. Bear your prizes with pride. Come. We will visit the\nTruthwatcher monastery as a formality, then continue to the final three.\nThey will be the most difficult for you, each a unique test.”\n“That’s it?” Syl demanded, a fury rising within. She wasn’t a windspren,\nbut she sure could feel like a storm when she wanted. “That’s it?”\n“What more do you want when a man is wrong?” Nale asked, calm, then\nturned and walked toward the steps.\nSyl started toward him, but stopped as Kaladin caught her eyes and\nshook his head. So she let the storming man go. Szeth carefully wrapped the\nnewest sword—making six of them they’d captured so far—with Kaladin’s\npack instead. But …\n“Wait,” she said. “Three more monasteries, not counting Truthwatcher,\nsince we have that sword already. Does that add up? We have six swords,\nbut shouldn’t there be ten overall?”\n“The Windrunner Honorblade has been corrupted,” Nale called from\nahead. He turned and glided up into the air instead of climbing the steps.\n“Our king, Jezrien, was killed by the Windrunner traitor, Vyre. Odium took\nhis Honorblade unto himself in that moment, corrupting it.” He stepped\nonto the hilltop and strode out of sight.\n“Huh,” Syl said, looking at the two boys. “Did either of you know that?”\n“Some of it,” Kaladin said. “Not the corrupting part.”"

Syl folded her arms. She could feel her\narms. Like she could feel her toes rub together when she had toes. She was\nalways solid to herself.\nShe glanced at Kaladin, who was shaking his head. “I know,” he said to\nher. “I feel it too.”\n“Your toes rubbing together?” she asked, cocking her head.\n“My … what? No, Syl, frustration. Nale is infuriating. He doesn’t\nactually follow the law—he changes his perceptions, motivations, and even\nmorals at the drop of a sphere. He acts like he’s made of iron, but the\nmoment he’s confronted with a logical inconsistency, he either changes the\nconversation or walks away.”\n“Kaladin, I think he’s as close to broken as Taln or Ash … maybe even\nmore.”\n“We only have four days until the contest.” He paused. “I’m … really\nnot going to find Ishar in time to help Dalinar, am I? I’m not going to be\nback in time to see the contest. Wit was … Wit was right, wasn’t he?”\n“I’m afraid he was,” Syl said. “But there’s a purpose for you here. Wit\nsaid so.”\nKaladin looked up. “The Wind said I have to do something important …\nmaybe more important than the contest. At least in her opinion. But what\ncould that possibly be?”\n“Restoring Ishar, perhaps?” she said.\n“Dalinar said,” Kaladin whispered, “that an oath sworn at the right time\nmight change Ishar.” He took a deep breath, and his eyes focused on Szeth\nclimbing the steps. “But more and more, I find myself worrying only about\nSzeth. Too much. Syl, it’s taking me over again. I went from being annoyed\nby him to hurting over how incapable I am of helping him. Just like with\nBridge Four … I start feeling isolated, like I will be the only one who\nsurvives, when everyone else withers away …”\nShe took his arm, and with effort and concentration, made imprints in his\nuniform with her fingers. He saw that and smiled.\n“We’re on a journey,” she said. “Between who we were, and who we\nwant to be. Both of us.”\n“I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do, though.”\n“What is it you keep telling Szeth about what he needs to be doing? That\nfollowing orders or laws slavishly isn’t as important as finding your own\npath?”\n“Fine, you’re right. As usual.”\n“Don’t say it that way.”\n“Because?”\n“Because I want to be right only when I’m right, not because it’s\nexpected. That’s part of my journey, Kaladin.”\n“To live for yourself, not only for others,” he said, “all while somehow\nstill wanting to help me.”\n“The same way you need to protect—but not make that everything about\nyou.”"

Not with this alone, but with helping Szeth. You’re incredible,\nSyl.”\nThere. She’d been waiting for that. She lifted a few inches off the\nground.\nBut don’t do it just for him, she told herself. Do it because it’s what you\nwant.\n“We find our balance, then,” Kaladin said. “Somehow.” He took a deep\nbreath, heaved out a sigh—and took to the air to follow the other two.\nShallan paced the confines of her rooms—in the Sebarial warcamp—at the\nShattered Plains. Like the previous times they’d created one of these little\nenclaves in the Spiritual Realm, color bled and the setting didn’t feel quite\nreal. Rlain and Renarin were at her sitting room table, and natural light\nshone in from the window in her bedroom. She’d snuck out through that\nwindow on multiple occasions when first infiltrating the Ghostbloods.\nUnlike the other two, Shallan—with Glys’s help—had formed a waiting\narea that was not her childhood bedroom. That was categorically good for\nthem all. Though she was largely doing better, if they tried to visit that\nmemory, they’d end up in a room with white carpet made red—and at least\none corpse.\n“It’s strange,” Renarin said. “I’m not tired or hungry. Glys can’t tell me\nhow long this has taken, but we must have been in the Spiritual Realm for\nat least ten hours.”\n“Tumi is the same,” Rlain said. “I think time is too nebulous to them. He\ntends to think in terms of what has been, and what will be, but not about the\ntime frame of either.”\nRenarin tapped the table with one finger. “Aunt Navani’s scholars say\nthat matter, energy, and Stormlight are the same thing—just different states.\nThis place seems to be made up entirely of Stormlight, or Investiture, or\nwhatever. When we entered, did we become Stormlight as well? If so, what\nwill happen with our bodies when we exit?”\n“I guess …” Rlain said. “I guess we’ll re-form?”\n“Assuming that is true,” Renarin said, glancing at her, “could we bring\nthings with us? Re-form them from their spiritual aspect? What could we\ncreate if we mastered this place?”\nIt was a valid question, but one Shallan couldn’t focus on. She continued\npacing.\n“Still worried,” Rlain guessed, “about how to kill the Ghostbloods?”\n“I’m a fool,” Shallan said. “Killing them here will be virtually\nimpossible. They can heal, and there’s Stormlight all around. I thought anti-\nLight must be dangerous—but it didn’t hurt him, exactly like it didn’t hurt\nme.”\n“Glys says …” Renarin cocked his head.

Might be tough to isolate them though, if they’re hiding inside a\nbody.”\n“I thought,” Rlain said to a slow, calm rhythm, “that Glys and Tumi were\nhis. Voidlight.”\n“They’re a mix,” Renarin said. “Glys says … something about a Rhythm\nof War …” He shook his head. “Is Tumi equally callous? About us killing\nhis brothers or sisters?”\n“We kill other humans all the time,” Shallan said, with a shrug.\n“We don’t!” Renarin said, then blushed. “I mean, I don’t … Still, I do\nfind all of this fascinating. Light. Anti-Light. Investiture. Energy.”\n“Is that why your father always wanted you to be an ardent?” Rlain said\nto the Rhythm of Curiosity. “This way of asking questions and thinking\nsuch interesting thoughts?”\n“Yeah,” Renarin said. “I don’t know if I refused just so I could resist\nwhat was expected, or if becoming an ardent felt like giving up on my\nfather’s hopes for me when I was young.”\n“You don’t have to live up to anyone’s expectations, Renarin,” Shallan\nsaid, stopping near him, the strangely saturated light spilling in through the\nwindow over her.\n“I know,” he said. “We always say things like that, Shallan, those of us\non the outside. It’s true enough. I don’t have to conform, become a warrior\nand a highprince the way everyone expects of my father’s sons. Yet I worry\nthat in our zeal, we forget that merely because something is more standard\nor conventional, that doesn’t make it bad.\n“My values are shaped by those around me, whom I respect. That makes\nit impossible to separate what my father wants of me from what I want for\nmyself—his ideals have in large part become my ideals. To try to separate\nmyself completely from those influences would also be a rejection of who I\nam. And … I’m doing it again. Getting lost in my own thoughts.” He\nlooked to Rlain for support.\n“I find this aspect of you to be fascinating,” Rlain said. “I’ve never really\nconsidered where I got my ideals.” He put his hand on the table, close to\nRenarin’s.\nDo not, Shallan thought at herself, get distracted by their flirting. She\nhad to save the world. She left them for the moment, approaching Pattern,\nwho stood in the doorway to the bedroom. “Those two,” she said as she\npassed, “are way too distracted.”\n“Mmm …” Pattern said.\n“Don’t you start.”\n“Start what? I have nothing at all to say about a budding young Radiant\nbeing distracted from important events by romantic dalliances.

He probably hadn’t seen battle yet. Still, she would have felt a\nlot better if he were here to hold.\nShe turned toward Pattern again. “It worries me how Mraize fooled us\nby taking Honor’s form. That could have easily gotten us killed. Plus, I’m\nconcerned about what Iyatil is plotting.”\n“Mmm … do you think she has a graph, or …”\n“She might be letting Mraize distract us. If so, he does it well—and\nconstantly outmaneuvers me.” She pulled out the anti-Stormlight knife. If\nshe could get to their spren … It was awful to contemplate. And yet, they\nwere enemy combatants.\nShe stalked back into the other room. “Have any of you seen Mraize’s\nspren when we interact?”\nRlain cocked his head. “Tumi says … he has had impressions of the\nspren watching from outside. But in here it’s hard to find someone who\ndoesn’t want to be found. Particularly a spren.”\n“They’ll be shy, like ours.”\nShallan gazed down at the dagger—which didn’t split into colors, like a\nlot of this vision. Instead it caused a little eddy around it, warping the air\nlike a puncture in reality. A thought occurred to her. “Maybe I don’t have to\nhurt them—maybe I can use this on Mraize. I didn’t dare heal when I had\nanti-Light in my system. Mraize didn’t either, earlier. So I simply have to\nwound him badly enough that he can’t wait out the anti-Light evaporating\nfrom him.”\n“Glys says that might work,” Renarin said, nodding. “If he pulls in\nStormlight to heal, and it meets anti-Light … that will be deadly.”\nShe nodded firmly. “Unfortunately, Mraize is a better fighter than I am.”\n“You did pretty well against him during the last fight, Shallan,” Rlain\nsaid with a praising rhythm.\n“I did, but that fight could just as easily have gone the other way—and I\nwas lucky to be able to fight him. If he’d managed to stab me in the back"

If he’d managed to stab me in the back\nwhen I wasn’t looking, that could have been it. I wish we could get the drop\non him for once.”\n“How would we manage that?” Renarin asked.\n“What if,” Rlain said, “instead of entering the visions directly, we sent in\nsome kind of avatar—and we watched from outside?”\n“Yes!” Shallan said. “Last time after leaving, I could kind of make out\nwhat was happening in the vision, and Lightweaving is ‘quiet.’ It won’t\ndraw the attention of the gods that hunt your spren. We could watch the\nGhostbloods, then strike when we have the upper hand.”\nThe two glanced at each other, and were probably communicating with\ntheir spren. Shallan glanced back toward Pattern, who had been joined by\nTestament—the other Cryptic had been lying on the overstuffed bed.\nShallan remembered how lavish these quarters had felt when she’d first\narrived.\nShe no longer saw such a bed as wasted on her. Relaxation was\nsomething she had earned, and she should enjoy it during the rare occasions\nwhen she wasn’t running into danger. It was all right for her to enjoy a little\nluxury in life. The same way it was all right for her to be happy with\nAdolin, and appreciate his love.\nShe really was feeling better. Except … on the writing desk by the\ndoorway were a handful of spheres without gemstones. Ends, used for\ngambling for no stakes—or in this case, for learning sleight of hand. Tyn\nhad given them to her. More by instinct than conscious thought, Shallan\nwalked over and palmed several of the spheres, replacing them with ones\nfrom her pocket. Then she did it again, a quick move while bumping into\nthe desk, or while raising her other hand as a distraction.\nPattern stepped over and put his long-fingered hand on her shoulder.\n“Formless speaks of each person I’ve killed, people who took me in and\ntrusted me,” Shallan whispered. “It feels … horrible when I see it in its\nwhole context, Pattern. Mother, Father, Testament, Tyn … Next, Mraize.\nHow many people who get close to me will I end up killing? Why does it\nhappen so often to me?”\n“I do not know, Shallan,” he whispered. “But as I have come to know\nhumans better, I can tell you this: you are awful at statistics.”\n“Is that supposed to be comforting?”\n“Yes!” he said. “You are so deeply flawed in your understanding of\nnumbers. It is in fact quite inspiring, yes.”\n“I … need a little help, Pattern,” she said. “Understanding what in\nDamnation you’re talking about.”\n“You are so bad at math!”\n“Don’t say that, Pattern,” she replied. “My name, at least, is parallel.\nThat’s a mathematical concept.”\n“… Your name?”\n“Yes.”\n“Parallel?”\n“Shallan,” she said. “Two ‘l’s. Pair’a’els.”\nHis pattern froze. Then, remarkably, he let out a loud guffaw. “That was\nactually funny!”"

Listen, you are all stupid about\nnumbers. You do well, for those with brains made of meat, but you think of\neverything wrong.” He pulled her from the room again and leaned closer.\n“Of all the people you’ve known, Shallan, how many have you killed? A\nfew?”\n“The important ones.”\n“Adolin?” he asked. “Dalinar, Navani? The brothers you protected—and\neven if we are speaking solely of mentors, Sebarial and Palona still live\ndespite their best efforts. And Jasnah. Hmmmm? You are not statistically\ndangerous to those around you. Only to those who try to kill you.”\n“Testament,” she whispered.\n“You are working to repair that error,” Pattern said. “Shallan, it is my job\nto help and protect you. I do a bad job sometimes! But today, let me\npromise: in you, I have found someone sincere. That is what attracted me—\nyour sincerity and your lies, combining to create a more important truth.\n“You will not hurt the people around you. Not intentionally, and not any\nmore than any other human. The statistics Formless gives you are the bad\nkind of lies—the lies that look at a truth and twist it into something worse. I\ntrust you. Testament trusts you, despite what happened. We love you.\nStatistically—real statistics—you have done an excellent job! I have\nultimate, mathematically backed faith that you will continue to do an\nexcellent job! So please, do not listen to Formless. Do not give her life.”\nShe put her hand on his, resting on her shoulder. “When did you get so\ngood at talking to humans?”\n“I listen to you,” Pattern said softly.\nShe smiled.\n“Then I do the opposite,” he added.\nHe could only let that hang for a moment before snickering and\nwhispering that it was a joke. Shallan smiled, then turned and walked into\nthe sitting room with the men.\n“Well?” she said.\n“Glys says Rlain’s plan could work,” Renarin told her. “Next vision,\nwe’ll avoid going in—and will instead send one of your Lightweavings\nwhile we watch.”\nSIXTEEN YEARS AGO\nSzeth lunged, his practice sword scraping along the back edge of his foe’s.\nSliding inside the man’s defenses, Szeth shoved him away, then slammed\nhis weapon into the side of his foe’s neck.

Though twenty acolytes watched, and three full\nshamans, no one spoke. Gonda was the monastery swordmaster, favored to\nsomeday hold the Honorblade.\nHe had not landed a touch on Szeth in all five of their bouts today.\nSzeth slowly removed his mask, bathing his sweaty face in cool air.\nGonda did not seem angry at Szeth; those of this monastery were indeed of\na different breed than the petty soldiers of the camp Szeth had left. Less\nopen resentment. Less brutality. But more strange politics behind the\nscenes.\nGonda’s practice sword fell from the rack as he placed it. He left it lying\nand pushed out of the training hall, footsteps loud in the silence. Like\nraindrops on a rooftop.\nSzeth carefully racked his own equipment, feeling the eyes of the other\nacolytes on him. Two years here had been good for him; in the camp, he’d\nrarely been challenged. When he’d arrived here, it had taken him weeks to\nland a single point on any of his companions.\nA strong current made for stronger fish. Szeth quietly pulled off his\ngambeson and handed it to the older acolyte in charge of cleaning\nequipment today. In Pozen’s monastery, the more hits you took during\ntraining, the more chores you did. It had been over a year since Szeth had\nbeen assigned such duties. It had been longer than that since he’d cried\nhimself to sleep, missing his mother.\nAll was right again. Here, he didn’t need to think—he could merely\ntrain. He liked how simple his life was at last. Even the behind-the-scenes\npolitics didn’t matter, not so long as you were good with a sword.\nAs he’d just proven, he was very good.\nPozen himself emerged from behind one of the pillars. Like the others in\nthe room, Szeth bowed. He hadn’t realized the Honorbearer was watching.\n“And so, Szeth,” the older man said, “you take the rank of swordmaster\nfor yourself.”\nSzeth did not reply. It was true.\n“I am impressed with everything about you,” Pozen said, “save your\nweakness with Elsecalling. It is a troubling shortcoming, Szeth.”\nAlso true. He’d practiced with the Blade, as for the defense of Truth—\nfor the preparation their people must make in the event of the Voidbringers’\nreturn—each monastery needed multiple trained Surgebinders in case the\nHonorbearer fell in battle.\n“I have prepared a hunt for you,” Pozen said. “The first clue is to be\nfound atop the seventh spire. Go.”\nSzeth had worried he would need to retire to his rooms now that he’d\nwon his title. That would have meant thinking, musing over his\naccomplishment.

        "text": "He started on it immediately.\nThe “seventh spire” was a riddle. Fortunately, he knew a tavern outside the\nmonastery, in Mokdown—the small city that filled the island here between\nrivers. The tavern was called First Spire. He assumed that the seventh\nwould be the seventh building on the street.\nUnfortunately, he found nothing atop that building. He stood on the roof,\narms folded, the confused homeowner holding the ladder below. He did\nanother search of the rooftop for anything crystalline—Pozen liked to\nSoulcast things into crystal. Nothing.\nFinally, Szeth climbed down the ladder. It was wood, of course, as were\nthe logs that made up the boardwalk. There were clay bricks here and there,\nimitating stone, but not holy. It was ingenious how the people of this region\nlearned to lock wooden pieces together into joints without using nails. It\nmade the wattle-and-daub structures or sod houses of his own home region\nlook decidedly primitive by comparison.\nWhich was what made it all the more odd when these people used metal\nhinges on their doors.\nSzeth thanked the homeowner, a portly man with a deferential way of\nspeaking. He wore a splash, but over here they did that by sewing patches\nonto their clothing. In this case, red on the knees. How was it they didn’t\nknow the proper way of things? Pozen had ordered him to stop talking\nabout it, but if Szeth were the one who was in the wrong, he would want\nsomeone to tell him.\nAfter being dismissed, the man opened the door to his home—despite\nthe steel hinges. If the door broke, he’d need to call an acolyte or a retired\nsoldier—many lived in this town—to fix it. In fact, there were a great\nnumber of carpenters, smiths, and other tradesfolk, who were men or\nwomen that had once been soldiers or acolytes and had retired after only a\nyear or two. It felt like … like they had chosen that life just to quit, so they\ncould be employed in such professions.\nSoulcast metal was reserved for tools that needed to be handled. The\nhinges came from mines, and everyone used them. So maybe these people\ndidn’t care about wearing their splashes wrong. Two years here, and Szeth\nstill tied his mind in knots pondering these things—when in reality he\nneeded to focus on the riddle.\n“Goodman,” Szeth called.\nThe man peeked back out his door.\n“What do you think of when I say ‘the seventh spire’?”\n“The Seven’s spire?” the man asked. “Well—”\n“No,” Szeth began, then stopped.\nThe Seven’s spire? The Seven was a street. Could he have misheard? It\nwouldn’t be the first time, as Pozen spoke with a slight Northern accent.\nOf course. The Seven.\n“Acolyte?” the homeowner asked.\n“Never mind,” Szeth said, turning on his heel. “Thank you for your aid.”\nHe started off, wooden paving logs firm underfoot. It really was\nremarkable, this wood of the makam tree. Light, strong. It made for an\ninteresting city—which Szeth tried not to hate.

Indeed, his father had made\ngreat improvements here after being elected mayor last year, moving from\ncity finance minister, an appointed position. Under Neturo’s direction, old\npaving logs had been replaced with new ones, the bridges repaired. Social\nreforms had been instituted encouraging the loggers to be less rowdy. Better\nworking hours, more frequent rotations for leave.\nNeturo didn’t seem bothered by what it had cost to get here, so Szeth\ntried not to be. Instead he enjoyed the whitewashed buildings, the way\npeople nodded in respect to an acolyte, the colors in patches on the clothing.\nIt didn’t smell too bad. Not like the towns back home, where horse dung\nhad covered the streets and sewage had been dumped in the river.\nMokdown was, if not fresh, at least bearable. Plus, he was the best of the\nacolytes, and had satisfying workouts each day. Surely the pain that Mother\nwasn’t here with them—and that he went weeks, sometimes months without\nseeing Elid, who liked to travel—would fade further. His old life was\nsupposed to have been burned away. The embers would die soon.\nThe Seven’s tallest building was a church to Ishu, the Herald. It had once\nbeen dedicated to Batlah—but sometime in the past, that had changed. The\npeople of Shinovar revered the Heralds almost as much as the sun, moons,\nand mountains, who were the greatest of spren. But Ishu was extra special\nfor having brought them to this land by listening for the songs of a new\nworld.\nAtop this building, Szeth found a crystal patch of shingles. Riddle\nsolved. Underneath it was a small slip of paper that held the next clue. The\nEastern Wind. Szeth climbed back down the side of the church. “Sorry,” he\nsaid to the Stone Shaman peeking out the window near the statue Szeth was\nusing for handholds.\n“It’s fine, acolyte,” she replied. “I do wish he’d warn us when he sends\npeople on these hunts. We were holding services …”\nSzeth bowed to her, then started along the street.\n“Acolyte?” the shaman said. When he glanced at her, she nodded to the\nside. He followed the gesture to where someone lounged near the front of\nthe building. A tall woman in colorful shaman robes, older than Szeth by a\ndecade, with that short haircut he still found flagrant. Sivi visited the city so\noften, one could mistakenly assume she was the local Honorbearer. Were\nthe Willshaper acolytes that disciplined, so as to pay no heed when their\nleader left? He’d heard the opposite. They said the Willshaper acolytes\ndrank, and went out riding, and barely trained at all.\nHe found that kind of frivolity implausible in Sivi. After all, he liked her.\n“Szeth,” she said, strolling over.\n“Honorbearer,” he said, bowing. “I’m sorry I cannot stop to speak with\nyou long. I have been set an urgent task by—”\nSivi held out a handful of small pieces of paper, identical to the one"

        "text": "you long. I have been set an urgent task by—”\nSivi held out a handful of small pieces of paper, identical to the one\nSzeth already had. “Pozen always uses the same places. I swear, I remember\nmy predecessor mentioning the crystal shingles when she was an acolyte.”\nSzeth gaped at the proffered handful of clues. “I … I can’t take those. I\nneed to find my own way to—”\n“I believe your instructions were to return with the papers,” she said.\n“There was no prohibition against someone handing them to you.”\nIt was true. So, Szeth accepted the papers.\n“Come and speak with me, Szeth,” she said, heading toward a nearby\ntavern. “I’d like to hear of your training.”\nHe sighed, but could not refuse an Honorbearer. Besides, Sivi did often\nhave a … perspective to share. He tried not to assume he was the reason for\nher frequent visits—but he couldn’t put out of his mind things he’d\noverheard. About Pozen’s plans for him.\nAt a quiet booth in the tavern—it was only three in the afternoon—he\ngot tea while she sipped something he pretended was barley water. Both\nfree, as this was a monastery town.\n“I heard,” she said, “that you made swordmaster today.”\n“That news spread already?” he asked, waiting out of respect to sip his\ntea until she drank first.\n“Gonda is good,” she said. “No one expected someone better to come\nalong.” She eyed him.\nHe looked down into his tea.\n“You know, don’t you?” she asked.\n“I’ve … overheard things I should not have.”\n“Pozen’s not shy about his aspirations for you, Szeth,” Sivi replied.\n“He’s been cultivating you for this role for years—since even before you\nwere an acolyte.”\n“I recognize the need,” Szeth said, forcing the words out, “for the best\nsoldiers to hold the Honorblades. That is Truth. To prepare for the coming\nof the enemy.”\n“Then why do you seem ashamed?”\nHe looked down, and did not reply.\nSivi sighed, then tapped the tabletop with one finger. “Szeth. Do you\nknow why Pozen sends you on these silly little hunts?”\n“I do not ask, and he offers no explanation.”\n“It’s because he wants to test your obedience. Pozen wants acolytes who\nare quick to obey, slow to question.”\n“That sounds like an admirable quality in a religious acolyte.”\n“And in a colleague?”\nThere it was. She said it openly.\n“You’re so quick to do as you’re told, Szeth,” Sivi said. “Why?”\n“It’s not what you think,” he said, blushing.\n“And what do I think?”\n“That I’m stupid,” Szeth said. “I obey for the opposite reason. If I don’t\nmove quickly … I start wondering. I start asking. I have an … unruly mind,\nhonor-nimi.”\n“Tell me,” she said, leaning forward, “the questions you ask, Szeth.”\nDared he say it? Was this a test to see if he obeyed her, or if he was self-\ncontradictory? They played so many games. Perhaps that was why he\nsecretly hated this city, because here—at last—he’d learned that even"

Perhaps that was why he\nsecretly hated this city, because here—at last—he’d learned that even\nHonorbearers saw things differently from one another.\n“Pozen is not the best swordsman,” Szeth said, watching the dark\nshifting colors swirl in the tea, leaking from the pouch. “Not anymore; he’s\nalmost sixty. Yet no one challenges him.”\n“He is wise,” she said. “Being the best soldier is not always about being\nquickest with a weapon. Experience is valuable, even after the body starts\nto slow.”\n“He could still offer wisdom while someone else bore the Blade.”\n“If a genuine threat came,” she replied, “he’d let one of his acolytes bear\nthe Honor when going into battle. Why do you think we train you all so\nwell with the weapon?”\n“This is reasonable,” Szeth said. “But if an aging Honorbearer isn’t that\ndire a problem, why is everyone—including you and Pozen—this eager for\nme to begin a pilgrimage?”\nShe smiled, then finally tipped her head back and took a long drink.\nWhen she set the cup back down, she met his eyes. “The Windrunner is a\nproblem.”\n“Honorbearer …” Szeth searched for the name. “Tuko-son-Tuko?”\n“Correct. You paid attention in lessons.”\n“Of course I did,” Szeth said, frowning. “Why would there be lessons if\none is not to pay attention?”\n“Oh, Szeth.”\nHe started into his drink, savoring the bitter taste.\n“Are you going to ask what the problem with Tuko is?”\n“Is it my place to ask?”\n“Well, I did leave that door wide open …”\n“Is he a problem to Truth?” Szeth asked. “And for the defense of our\nlands?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then that is enough.” He met her eyes. “I haven’t heard the Voice in a\nwhile.”\n“He’s been busy.”\n“And if I’m an Honorbearer,” Szeth said, “will I get to know what he is?\nWhat is actually going on?”\n“If you want to know.”\nDid he? Szeth settled back on the hard bench of their booth, looking out\nthe window at the passing people. Pozen had said Mokdown wasn’t large\nby most standards. Szeth found it hard to imagine more people moving\nthrough the streets without carriages and wagons crushing people or\ncausing chaos.\nNone of the people outside knew about the Voice. None of them cared\nthat they didn’t know. He could be like them.\nBut …\n“After I destroyed the invaders,” Szeth said, “Pozen was ready to\ncompletely abandon me—all of you were. Then, the moment you knew I’d\nheard the Voice, you welcomed me.”\n“The context changed,” she said. “One moment you were a rogue agent\nacting against the interests of his Farmer. The next, you were a servant of a\ngreater power.”\n“Actions should be right or they should be wrong. That’s what I was\ntaught.”\n“When you were a child,” she said, “you were taught what a child can\nunderstand. Why does nuance terrify you, Szeth?”\n“Because,” he whispered, “I can’t predict it.”"

Don’t you think you should have grown a little since then?”\nHe looked up from his tea. Wait. She—\n“Your father and I talk,” she said. She looked wistful as she said it, a hint\nof a smile on her lips.\nFor once, he caught the nuance.\n“You don’t keep visiting the city because of me,” he said, horrified. “Not\nonly for me.”\nShe shrugged.\n“My father is a heretic! You’re a holy woman!”\nShe snorted in amusement, nearly spitting out her beer. “He’s hardly a\nheretic, and I’m merely halfway holy, Szeth. Your father is a man of strong\nfaith, just not in things that don’t matter. You should ask him sometime.”\nThose kinds of conversations never went as Szeth wanted.\n“Will you do it?” she asked. “Will you go on pilgrimage, in preparation\nto challenge the Windrunner for his Blade?”\nPilgrimage. He would need to visit each monastery and train in all the\nSurges. Then he would have to defeat the Windrunner in a duel without\npowers. That wouldn’t have to be deadly; it depended on whether Tuko\nwould surrender the Blade willingly or not. But … the Windrunner did not\nseem the type, from what Szeth had heard, to give up the Blade willingly.\nHe was young to be an Honorbearer. And reportedly very skilled.\nAfter winning the Blade—if he succeeded in that—Szeth would have to\ngo on a pilgrimage to the monasteries again and present himself to the\nHonorbearers, proving to their satisfaction that he was worthy. Lest they as\na group renounce and condemn what he’d done—returning the Blade to the\nprevious Honorbearer if he lived, or finding a replacement if he didn’t.\nIt could take years. A decade. Longer.\n“Szeth?” she asked. “Will you do what we ask?”\n“How can I trust that it’s right to listen to you!” Szeth said, throwing his\nhands in the air. “If nuance changes what is right and wrong for you on a\nwhim!” He sat back in his seat, puffing. Then he groaned softly. “That did\nsound childish, didn’t it?”\nWhen he said that, Sivi relaxed visibly and took a long pull on her drink.\n“It’s that satisfying to you,” Szeth said, “to see me frustrated?”\nShe held up a finger, still drinking. She downed the entire thing. Storms.\n“It’s satisfying,” she said, wiping her lip, “to know I was correct: there is\nsomething in you that is willing to self-reflect. Why do you find it so hard,\nSzeth?”\n“I just want things to be easy,” he said. “Like they were when I was\nyoung.”\n“That’s laziness.” She pointed at him, leaning forward across the table.\nShe did that a lot. Such passion. Had he ever felt that passionate about\nanything?\nYes, he thought. About finding answers."

About finding answers.\n“Listen,” Sivi said. “Life was never easy when you were young, Szeth.\nYou were merely allowed to pretend that it was. Other people were always\nout there making these kinds of choices.”\n“But—”\n“Just because your life gave you the luxury of simplicity doesn’t mean\nthe world was magically less complex,” she said. “Tell me. Aren’t you glad\nyou got to escape your childish notions, and see the world as it really is?”\n“I …” Glad? For all of this?\nThat was … uncomfortably close to what he’d been thinking earlier, that\nhe’d want to be informed if he were wearing splashes wrong. Huh. He\nconsidered that as Sivi ordered another drink from the barmaid, who\nhovered barely far enough away to be discreet.\nIf he was wrong about religion, wouldn’t he want to know? Yes. Yes, he\nwould. And wouldn’t he be glad to have been corrected? In a moment of\ndeep reflection, he realized his errors. It wasn’t their fault for using nuance;\nit was his for not wanting to see it.\n“I’ll do it,” he said. “I’ll go on the pilgrimage. If you took me in first to\ntrain with your Blade, I’d like that. Let me fulfill my final requirements as\nan acolyte here, so that I might be elevated to warrior elite.” He would of\ncourse choose that path rather than becoming a ministering shaman, the\nother option for an acolyte.\n“Excellent,” she said.\n“What would you have done,” he said, “if I hadn’t been willing to accept\nyour advice?”\n“Wouldn’t be the first time,” she said with a sigh. Then, to his\nquestioning gaze, she continued, “Three of the other current Honorbearers\ntrained with Pozen—he has a sixth sense for finding talented warriors. But\nhe has also proven himself quite skilled at finding people who will jump\nwhen he commands. It almost makes one think he wants servants more than\ncolleagues.” She nodded to him, standing and taking her beer from the tray\nas it arrived. “I’ve got someone else to visit. See you at my monastery in a\nfew months.”\nSzeth tried not to think about who she was seeing. Before she left\nthough, she stepped back and leaned down by him. “Pozen is using you.\nRemember that.”\n“And you?” Szeth asked. “Are you using me?”\nShe winked at him.\n“I’m not doing this because you want me to,” he said, “or because he\ndoes. I’m doing it for answers. I will know what the Voice is.”\n“We’re all counting on it, Szeth,” she said, then left—taking her cup with\nher.\nSzeth made sure to pay for it before he left. Free drinks were one thing,\nbut they shouldn’t be exploiting the tavern by taking their cups.\nJasnah says that the existence of an all-powerful and all-loving\nGod must be questioned by the simple evidence of injustices done\nin life to the innocent, such as the child who dies from disease."

        "text": "Jasnah says that the existence of an all-powerful and all-loving\nGod must be questioned by the simple evidence of injustices done\nin life to the innocent, such as the child who dies from disease.\n—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar Kholin\nSigzil clutched his squire Deti in the middle of a battlefield and screamed.\nFor help, for Stormlight, for a healer. His words were lost in the chaos of\nred lightning and shouting soldiers as the enemy poured in through the hole\nmade by the dead thunderclast, the defenses broken open once more.\nLightning flashed from the ground around him as stormforms unleashed\ntheir power to mirror that above.\nDeti had blood on his lips, and trembled, surrounded by painspren—like\ntiny disembodied hands, clawing at the ground as they moved. Deti’s\npanting was dull, lacking Stormlight, which had been depleted in their clash\nwith some Heavenly Ones.\n“Take mine!” Sigzil said. “Take my Light, Deti!”\nBut Sigzil’s gemstones were drained.\nDeti put a hand to his face, blood and rain mixing, then gasped. “It\ncomes!” Deti shouted. “The Night of Sorrows! I stand on the precipice of\ndawn and watch it advance, consuming all light, all life, all hope! IT\nCOMES!”\nDeti’s light faded. Sigzil screamed again and seized a lance from a dead\nHeavenly One nearby, crumpled in a heap from where Sigzil had dropped\nher. He raised the weapon, which had drained away Deti’s Stormlight, and\nbellowed into the night, seeking foes to kill.\nHe found plenty.\n“Sigzil,” Vienta whispered. “You are in command. You cannot afford\nrage. You must fall back and find Stormlight.”\nHe rushed toward a group of his soldiers who were surrounded by\ndireform Regals, with their bulky, spiked carapace and glowing red eyes.\nSigzil ripped into their ranks, killing with a weapon that could suck away\ntheir Voidlight—expelling it into the night, for the gemstone mechanism at\nthe lance’s pommel had cracked in its fall. He did all of this while wielding\nVienta as a short dagger in his off hand.\nHe broke through, and found two Edgedancers among the soldiers. Mere\nfeet away from a dying man they could have saved, had they known. That\nmade even more angerspren boil at his feet.\nYou need to regroup our forces, Sigzil, Vienta said. You cannot bring Deti\nback. It’s time to retreat.\nSigzil continued to kill, always underestimated by his foes, as he was\nshorter than many of the Alethi around him. And storms, his logical side\nwould not shut up. It agreed with Vienta. Once he’d fought those soldiers\nclear, he led them and the two Edgedancers in a retreat toward a stabilizing\nline of human forces at the rear of Narak Four. He dismissed his Blade and\ntossed the stolen lance to an armorer, then took gemstones off a runner boy\nwhose job was to deliver them to Radiants in the field.\nThere were only a handful, as they had to ration.

When were the\nstorming Bondsmiths going to return? Sigzil surveyed the dark plateau,\noverrun with red-eyed figures, and knew the day was lost. Winn, the old\ngeneral with a full head of silver hair, joined him.\n“Orders, sir?” the elderly general shouted over the thunder.\n“Time to retreat,” Sigzil said, breathing deeply, rain streaming down his\nface. This was his plan, but storms, he’d hoped to hold another day. “Give\nthe command.”\nAs Winn did so, Sigzil sent Vienta to warn his squires—flying in pairs\nabove—of the situation. He looked across the plateau toward the lump that\nwas Deti, dead on the stone, and felt a treasonous sense of powerlessness.\nStorms, he thought. This is what Kal felt, isn’t it? What eventually broke\nhim?\nHe could learn from what his captain had endured. It wasn’t Sigzil’s\nfault, but the fault of the enemies, that his squire had fallen. He did his best\nto quash the thoughts about what he could have done differently, either in\ntraining or in the fighting today, to better protect Deti. He focused instead\non helping the living. It worked, to an extent.\nAs his spren arrived, he spent some of his precious Stormlight to rise in\nthe air and defend the back line of soldiers. He could see they took heart\nfrom seeing him hovering with his silvery spear in hand. They held\nstronger, emboldened as groups of beleaguered men found their way to this\nbastion of defense. More Edgedancers began to streak across the plateau,\nreturning from where they’d been flanking the enemy forces. They picked\nup the fallen, healing them and carrying them to safety. Sigzil called the\nfinal retreat as the Stormwall and his group of Shardbearers held the\nbridgehead.\nTheir retreat took them all across Narak Two, the Oathgate plateau,\nwhich was connected to all three side plateaus. Narak Prime was to the east,\nand Narak Three to the southwest. His forces managed to get off the broken\nplateau, and the Stonewards dropped the bridge.\n“The enemy appears to be celebrating,” Vienta whispered in his ear. “I\nsee no indications they plan to push the assault further today. Well done.”\nSigzil nodded curtly, not feeling it. Yes, his plan had worked so far—but\nif they had to keep rationing Stormlight …\nSkar and Leyten landed and checked in with him. Sigzil told them softly\nabout Deti. Skar already knew, his team having done a few passes over the\nfallen plateau to search for pockets of survivors. They’d seen the body.\nNearby, generals began to confer on how to draw enemy attention to Narak\nThree next, the other plateau they could afford to lose. That was going to be\ntricky, though Sigzil had some ideas.\nFor now, another item bothered him. “Leyten, Skar,” he said, “Deti\nspoke a Death Rattle when he died. Moelach is here.”"

Moelach is here.”\nLeyten grunted. “I’ll poke around and see if anyone else heard anything\nfrom the dying today. I’m not too concerned though. Moelach never takes\npart in the fighting.”\n“There might be other Unmade,” Sigzil warned. “Pass the word, you\ntwo.”\n“Will do,” Skar said. “You’re not blaming yourself for this, are you?”\n“Trying my best not to, but you know how it feels.”\nLeyten nodded. “I wish I didn’t, but I do.”\n“I’ll focus on the next phase of our strategy, and the academics will\ndistract me. I can’t afford to mope right now—the generals and troops need\nto know I’m proud of the fighting they did, and of their excellent execution\nof my plan.”\n“Storms,” Leyten said. “Sig, you really sound like a leader.”\nDid he? He … did. “Blame Kaladin,” he said, managing a wan smile\ndespite the day’s gloom. “And what he made of all of us.”\n“Blame Kaladin,” Skar agreed. “Storming man and his inspiring ways.”\n“Any of you see Moash during the fighting?”\n“No,” Leyten said. “But we’re keeping watch. The moment he appears,\nwe’ll make sure you know. Then there will be a reckoning.”\nChaos retreated around Shallan, but she didn’t emerge into a vision—not\nexactly. Instead, the complex flowing tides of the Spiritual Realm fashioned\na kind of wall before her. The cloudy glass grew with the same creeping\nuncertainty as frost on a window, forming a wide, vaguely round pillar.\nWooden planks in several elevated tiers appeared next, around the glass\npillar—and Shallan was able to climb them, as if she stood on some kind of\nstrange scaffolding outside reality. Pattern and Testament emerged with her,\nand then farther up—because the scaffolding created disjointed levels—\nRlain, Renarin, and their spren appeared.\nAfter three attempts, she was slowly getting accustomed to the process.\nThis was all created by Renarin and Glys—using Renarin’s instincts for\nhow it should look, re-creating some scaffolding he’d seen around a\nmonastery in his youth.\nShallan hunted around the pillar for a good spot to peek in. Renarin\nthought the cloudy glass was a visual manifestation of the uncertainty of\nthis place—but some spots were less opaque. She located one and knelt on\nthe plank, looking through to see a battle happening on the other side.\nDalinar and Navani had been moving through the Desolations for some\ntime now, and this pillar was the way that Glys and Tumi allowed Shallan’s\nteam to watch.\nThey’d seen Desolation after Desolation—sometimes hundreds of years\napart—as the Bondsmiths moved out of the shadowdays toward the future.\nIn the last one, Shallan had seen people with spren and powers—early\nKnights Radiant, complete with Shardplate emblazoned with glyphs.\nDalinar had leaped straight over the days of Nohadon, and the founding of\nthe Radiants."

        "text": "Knights Radiant, complete with Shardplate emblazoned with glyphs.\nDalinar had leaped straight over the days of Nohadon, and the founding of\nthe Radiants.\nSo far, she had spotted no sign of Mraize or Iyatil—either inside or\noutside the visions. But they’d be there, following Dalinar, as they believed\nhis quest for Honor would lead them to Mishram as well. Today’s\nbattlefield was in Shinovar, and it had changed during the millennia since\nthat first vision. A blanket of languid green grass now grew where once\nthere had been only wet dirt. Trees dotted the landscape in small groups, as\nif conversing at a dinner party.\nStrange, how often the fighting in these visions happened in Shinovar—\nthe isolationist kingdom hadn’t been so unapproachable back then, it\nseemed. She peered through her clearer section of glass. There. Those\nglowing figures swooping through the sky … those were Windrunners.\nDalinar and Navani were heading straight toward the Recreance: the day\noaths had been broken, the origin of the secrets that everyone was hunting.\n“Did you see those Windrunners?” Renarin asked, boards creaking as he\napproached. “And soldiers with good bronze weapons this time. I think\nthey’re finally making technological progress, rather than losing it with\neach Desolation.”\n“We’re too far away from the action,” Shallan said, squinting. “Can you\nget us in closer?”\n“I’ll talk to Glys,” he said.\nSuddenly their window looked straight into the midst of a battle with the\nsingers—a hectic mess. Yes, the Radiants were here, but not in the distinct\nuniforms she was accustomed to. However, the human combatants did\nmaintain a formation for once. A giant shield wall with spears.\n“That almost looks modern,” Rlain said from somewhere nearby. “Your\npeople are using the same tactics here that they used against mine on the\nShattered Plains.”\n“Not exactly,” Renarin said. “That’s a shield wall, yes, but not a modern\nflexible block. No pikes, no cavalry, no heavy infantry—just well-drilled\nlight infantry. This is still thousands of years ago, but something big has\nchanged.”\n“Metalworking,” Rlain said.\n“It’s more that they can achieve continuity,” Shallan said. “People can\nstart progressing at last, now that society isn’t obliterated every time the\nFused return.”\n“Exactly,” Renarin said. “While even the Recreance is shadowed, we\nhave learned a lot from Father’s previous visions, and have some\nfragmentary texts from before. The Radiants during this period became a\nstable force connecting the people between Returns—a group of warriors\nwho trained during the decades of peace, and were ready when the battle\ninevitably came.”\n“Watchers at the rim,” Shallan whispered.\n“Against my people,” Rlain said.\n“Against the worst instincts in all people,” Shallan said, pulling back\nfrom the window. “Rlain, you yourself explained to me how the listeners\nrefused to continue the fighting—and left. The Fused didn’t just oppress us.\nThey did your kind as well.”\nRlain shook his head. “That’s too simple an explanation, Shallan. One"

One\nside escalates, so the other must match—or go further. The Fused wouldn’t\nexist if the humans hadn’t begun to outgrow the land given them. The\nHeralds wouldn’t exist if the Fused hadn’t been created to stop this\nincursion.\n“In turn, the Fused hardened—growing more and more determined each\ntime they returned, learning to fight and defeat the Heralds. Humankind was\nleft desolate, which led to the founding of the Radiants. The war simply\nkept spinning, and spinning, and spinning. I can decry the bloodshed, but I\ndon’t blame the singers of these ancient days. Humans broke their promises\nand invaded. What else would you do but fight?”\nShe looked back at the window and saw a group of five Fused—\nMagnified Ones—smashing into the human phalanx, throwing men into the\nair. Stonewards came in, dashing to counter them, their brilliant armor\nappearing out of place on this battlefield. Those were essentially modern\nShardbearers, among common soldiers wearing sculpted bronze\nbreastplates, the kind she’d seen in a museum in Kharbranth.\n“I …” she said. “Rlain, the singer side did serve Odium.”\n“Because the other gods refused to help them.” He hummed to a soft\nrhythm. “This ancient war ended with the mass enslavement of my kind,\nsave a handful. Is that the only acceptable answer? One people or another\nhas to be subjugated, or even destroyed?”\n“Rlain,” Renarin said, “my father is trying to end the war with peace.\nHe’s willing to risk our homeland for it. There are other answers. There\nhave to be.”\n“If Odium will let any of those answers work,” Rlain said. “And what\nwill your father’s peace offer my people? They are abandoned to the enemy\ngod. I wish … I wish there were something to be done not only for the\nhumans, but for the singers too.”\nThey fell quiet, watching death play out on the historical battlefield.\nShallan tried to make sense of it, to see if she could spot Dalinar and\nNavani. But this was too close.\n“Can you move us to the top of that hill?” she asked.\n“This isn’t your map with Father, Shallan,” Renarin said. “I can’t just\nzoom us around. Glys says we’re lucky to see anything.”\n“Give it a try, please,” she said. She couldn’t afford to get distracted by\nthe historical implications of all this—she was here to stop Mraize and\nIyatil.\nRenarin and Glys discussed, and their window jumped to a hilltop. Not\nthe one she’d requested, but it would work. Their window wouldn’t be\nvisible to those inside the vision, Glys assured them. It still felt strange;\nsoldiers could run straight through them, without noticing.\n“There,” she said, finding Dalinar and Navani watching from another\nhill.

She smiled, as seeing them reminded her of Adolin—who hopefully\nwas having a much easier time than she was. Dalinar and Navani would\nlikely observe this vision a short time, find out the year if they could, then\nuse their anchor to jump forward many years, skipping Desolations.\nShe hoped they wouldn’t end up skipping the most important moments,\nrequiring backtracking. But it felt to her that fate itself—or the power that\nmade up the Spiritual Realm—recognized when events had significance.\nMaybe because humans and singers gave them importance. That sort of\nthing echoed, and also let you predict the future a little. Wit had, by his own\nexplanation, come to Roshar specifically because he’d been able to feel that\nimportant events were impending. He’d once even attended a festival near\nher home estates.\nTwo Heralds crested a hill nearby, and Shallan glanced away. Shallan …\nVeil said inside her.\nShe forced herself to look back. At a woman with red hair, walking\nbeside Jezrien the king.\nThe implications of this are daunting, Radiant thought.\nWe have to acknowledge them anyway, Veil said.\nFor now, Shallan let herself turn away. “What is that?” she said, pointing\nto a darkened area where the grass was in shadow but no cloud was visible.\n“Glys says one of the Unmade is there,” Renarin said, stepping closer to\nher. “It’s … Shallan, it’s Ba-Ado-Mishram. Not the real her, of course—a\nhistorical reconstruction in the vision.”\nThey’d caught glimpses of the other Unmade during previous battles,\nand Shallan felt annoyed that she hadn’t been able to see their creation. That\nevent was mysterious even to the spren. What were the Unmade?\nRegardless, they’d never caught sight of Mishram before in one of these.\n“I’m going in,” Shallan said. “Tell Glys to send me.”\n“We said we were going to stay outside,” Renarin said, hopping down to\nher level, shaking the scaffolding. “Only send in illusions.”\n“We said,” Shallan replied, “that we’d send in illusions until we saw\nsomething important. I recognize that stopping Mraize and Iyatil is most\nimportant, but maybe interacting with Mishram—even the historical one—\ncould tell us something.”\n“You still want to find the prison, don’t you?” Renarin asked. “Whether\nor not we stop the Ghostbloods first.”\nAnd … was he humming to a rhythm?\nRlain stepped up to the edge of the higher scaffolding. “I think she\nshould go in, Renarin. The plan is working—we have surveyed the\nlandscape and looked for the Ghostbloods. Plus, with this framework, you\nand I can keep watch on her.”\n“All right,” Renarin said. “Wave if something is wrong, and we’ll pull\nyou out.”\nShallan nodded, and an eyeblink later she was inside the vision.\nSIXTEEN YEARS AGO\nThe day he was to leave on his pilgrimage to become an Honorbearer, Szeth\nspent the morning in the monastery’s rock garden.

Well, except for the Stoneward powers—they didn’t have the Blade\nof Talmut-son-God—and the Bondsmith powers. That Blade was held by a\ncivil leader, and passed down through a different tradition.\nToday Szeth prayed, bowing before a brilliant stone: two feet across with\na crystal vein running through the center. It opened at one side like a mouth,\nthe crystal forming teeth. The spren of this stone certainly seemed an\nostentatious type.\n“Spren,” he whispered. “In wisdom, please, guide me.”\nEvery important moment in his life had involved a stone, hadn’t it? Was\nthis one looking back, as he gazed upon it? Hesitant, he reached out and put\nhis hand on it, feeling the grain of the surface, jutting with little bits of clear\ncrystal. Still such a strange sensation, like the skin of some beast.\nFor a moment he felt … memories. As if … this stone had come from\nanother place, and remembered being carried … with a group of terrified\npeople …\nIs this you? he wondered. Are you the spren I follow?\nAh, Szeth, the Voice responded, and it had a different sensation, the\nmemories vanishing. Don’t think I’ve been ignoring you. You’ve merely\nbeen in good hands. Complete your pilgrimage. Then we will meet.\n“Thank you,” Szeth whispered.\nYour life has purpose, Szeth. Everything that has happened to you, I\norchestrated. You have meaning because your meaning is part of my\nmeaning.\nThose words.\nThose words were what he needed: a reminder that his life was not an\naccident.\nI warn you, the Voice said, this next part will be the most difficult. You go\namong some who do not regard me as highly as Pozen does. Do not lose\nyour way.\nAt least he wouldn’t be alone. You will be with me, right? Szeth asked\nthe Voice.\nNo response.\n“Father plans to follow you, Szeth.”\nHe shook out of his meditation and became aware of a quiet stream, a\nlatticework skylight filtering sunlight, and fronds sheltering a variety of\nstones. No one would dare interrupt his final meditation … except Elid.\nStanding by the doorway was a lean woman who—like Szeth—had their\nmother’s wiry strength. He’d seen Elid some mornings, exercising and\ntraining to use the sword with the shamans on the riverbanks. In this city, all\nwho touched stone were, if they wished, allowed to train in weapons with\nthe shamans. He’d found it strange—or perhaps oddly encouraging—that\nhere, fighters weren’t dismissed as “those who subtract.” Merely “those\nwho touch stone.” It was the wrong way of things, but sometimes the wrong\nway could … sound better.\nIndeed, Elid carried a small side sword—symbolizing her commitment\nto Truth.\n“You are forbidden in the monastery, Elid,” he said, turning back to his\ncontemplation of the rock.\n“I’ve been thinking of joining up,” she said. “Been talking to some of the\nshamans. They told me I should look around.”"

They told me I should look around.”\n“Your efforts to circumvent propriety are, as always, awkward,” Szeth\nsaid. “Pretending you want to join simply so you can come bother me is\ninappropriate.”\n“It worked.”\n“I am supposed to be alone during this meditation.”\n“Which means we can talk in private,” she said.\nHe sighed, contemplating fetching a shaman to throw her out.\n“Did you even hear me?” she said. “Father is planning to go with you.\nAgain. When you leave on pilgrimage.”\nSzeth felt a sudden, deep sense of relief. He hadn’t thought … but of\ncourse. Neturo would do as he always had. While some young men would\nhave acted embarrassed by the idea of their father traveling with them,\nSzeth did not need such lies.\n“I did not consider that he would come,” Szeth said, “but I am not\nsurprised. It has been his behavior in the past.”\n“You need to tell him to stay,” Elid said.\n“Why?”\nShe strode farther into the garden, not even pausing to offer prayer to the\nstones she passed. “Szeth! He’s built something here! He’s the mayor.”\n“A strange position,” Szeth said. “Why let men choose a leader, instead\nof trusting the spren? We didn’t do anything like that at home.”\n“Because we were backwater sheepherders!”\nHe thought for a moment she’d stopped to reverence a stone, but no, she\ncouldn’t be … Elid jumped over a section of garden from path to path to\nstand near Szeth. That woman …\n“You can’t let him go with you, Szeth,” she said, looming above where\nhe knelt on the soft, mossy soil, his hand still on the top of the stone. “Do\nthe right thing—let him stay.”\n“I don’t let or make him do anything, Elid.”\n“You don’t say anything, but you imply a whole lot.”\n“And you,” he said, “always like to make so many assumptions.” With a\nquiet prayer, he removed his hand from the stone, then stood up—trying to\nshelter the rock from her tantrum. “Maybe Father wants to go on\npilgrimage. Maybe he wants to go live at the Willshaper monastery. Maybe\nhe has … reasons.”\nElid gaped at him. “You know.”\n“About Father and Sivi? Yes. I deduced it.”\nShe gaped again, her eyes wide, jaw dropping.\n“What?” he demanded.\n“I just thought if you knew,” she said, “you’d spend every day preaching\nat him about his sinful state, Szeth. What, do you berate him during lunch\nwhen I’m not around?”\nHe blushed, then started to walk out of the rock garden. They could at\nleast have this conversation somewhere less holy.\n“You honestly don’t care?” she said, hurrying to keep up with him. “You\ndon’t think what they’re doing is wrong?”\n“Mother left him,” Szeth said.\n“She might come back!”\nHe halted in place, causing Elid to lurch to a stop. He met her gaze, eye\nto eye, as they were roughly the same height."

If Father goes with you, then that will soon mean the end\nof him and Sivi.”\n“So you’re in favor of their relationship?”\n“I’m in favor of anything that doesn’t rip our family apart further.”\nHe met her eyes. “You could have gone back; you could have stayed\nwith her.”\n“And leave Father?” Elid said. In a moment, her confidence seemed to\nevaporate as she wrapped her arms around herself. “I miss her. Do you?”\n“Yes,” he whispered.\n“I used to feel sorry for you,” Elid said. “Used to want to protect you,\nlike Father. But … then she left us …” She shook her head. “That broke\nFather. You know how many nights I spent holding his hand while he cried?\nYou weren’t there, Szeth. I was.”\n“I know.”\nBut there was a reason. The Voice. Szeth walked a purposeful path. He\nhad to believe it.\n“Well, I’m not going to go with you this time,” Elid snapped. “I’m not\ngoing to spend the rest of my life pretending you’re a lost child. If you have\nany kind of decency, you’ll tell Father to stay so you don’t keep ruining his\nlife either.”\nSzeth stepped around her. He quickly bowed his head to each stone as he\nwalked, his emotions in turmoil.\n“Do you know why?” Elid called after him. “Why he’s always willing to\nfollow you? Why he doesn’t care about me as much as he does you? Why\nare you his favorite?”\nSzeth bowed his head again, this time not out of reverence. He reached\nthe doorway.\n“I hate you,” Elid called after him. “I hate you, Szeth!”\n“I’m sorry,” he whispered, “for not knowing a better way.”\nHe left his sister behind then. Taking only a change of clothing and his\nsword as he left the monastery.\nIt was raining by the time Szeth reached the bridge. He walked alone, by\ntradition … but not by law. So it wasn’t strictly against any rules for Neturo\nto meet him there. Pack slung over his shoulder, his beard now streaked\nwith grey. Heavyset, with no splash, but smiling.\nHow could he smile? Szeth felt he’d lost the capacity years ago.\n“Thought you could sneak away without me?” Neturo asked.\nSzeth took a deep breath and spoke the words he’d needed to go over a\nhundred times in his head during this walk. “Please stay behind, Father.”\nNeturo considered, rain streaming off his umbrella. Szeth had brought\nnone. It was a light rainfall; he would merely need to care for the sword\nwhen he found shelter for the night.\n“Is that what you want, Szeth?” Neturo asked. “Or is it what you think\nyou should want?”\n“You have a life here,” Szeth said.\n“I have a life wherever my family is.”\n“Your family is here too!” Szeth said. “With Elid.

Who left because of me …”\nFather dropped the umbrella and seized him in an embrace. Szeth held in\nthe tears, although they would have been invisible in the rain. He did not\nwish to offend the spren by acting as if a pilgrimage were a sad occasion.\n“Szeth,” Father whispered to the sound of splashing rain, “what\nhappened between your mother and me was not your fault. We were\nstruggling long before you found that stone.”\n“Really?”\n“Really.”\n“That could have been my fault too, though. It had to be hard, living\nwith a boy who didn’t know what is right.”\nFather held tighter. “Son. It was never you. I took your mother from her\nfamily and persuaded her to question things that others never dare. For that,\nwe were forced to live outside, as no one would rent to us. I have letters\nfrom her sisters. She’s happy, Szeth. Happier without me.”\nThat sounded insane, but there it was. Szeth did not question whether it\nwas the truth, if his father had spoken it.\n“You should still stay with Elid,” Szeth whispered.\n“Elid hates me, Szeth.”\n“What? No! She loves you.”\n“That’s not what she says,” Neturo said softly. “I don’t know how to deal\nwith her. I never have. I try to talk to her, and she walks away. I bring her\ngifts, and she accuses me of trying to bribe her.” Neturo took a deep breath.\n“I think that … space will do us good. I’ll come back later, and see if she’s\ncooled off.” He pulled away from the embrace, and kept on smiling through\nthe water streaming down his face. “I don’t want you to think you have to\ncare for your old father. But I’ll go with you, Szeth, so you don’t have to go\nby yourself. It’s the only way I know how to help.”\n“Thank you,” Szeth whispered. “Thank you.”\nJasnah’s argument is probably the greatest a person could make\nagainst what I teach, and so it must be addressed. I am not\ncertain I have the philosophy, the words, or the experience to do\nso with the respect it deserves.\n—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar Kholin\nShallan appeared in a dying body.\nShe gasped at the sudden pain, putting a hand to her side and feeling\nblood as she lay on the Shin grass, the sun blazing overhead. Storms. She\nwas in the body of a mortally wounded singer. That made her panic before\nshe felt something in her mind …\nMmm … Shallan?\n“Pattern? You’re in my mind. Like when you’re a sword.”\nOur bond has been strengthening. You have said the proper truths. We\nthought maybe this would start to work.

He wanted to get\nyou into a singer so that you’d be able to understand Mishram, but … well\n…\n“It’s all right,” Shallan whispered. “Maybe we should try again? Pull me\nout? Or maybe I’ll just heal—”\nMmm … Pattern said. A singer using Stormlight would draw attention\nfrom anyone watching. Glys wants you to avoid that. He says you won’t\nreally die, because you’re not really wounded, but … I’ll tell him to pull you\nout anyway.\n“Thank you,” Shallan said, squeezing her eyes closed against the pain,\none hand on the wound—the broken carapace felt odd beneath her fingers.\nWait. Shallan, look.\nShe frowned and raised her head, though that made her vision swim. She\nwas lying among a large group of corpses and the mortally wounded, the\nbattle having moved on. Some bodies bled red, others orange, and a mess of\nspren—fearspren, angerspren, confusionspren, painspren—sprinkled the\nground and air, to her singer body’s eyes looking closer to their forms in\nShadesmar than the way humans saw them. Some ten feet away, a singer\nwept and clutched at the wounds along her side, humming in fits and spurts.\nA song perhaps, to comfort herself as she died.\nBa-Ado-Mishram was approaching. The Unmade took the shape of a\nblack mass of smoke, with hands growing out of it to move. Powerful\nhands, entirely black, stretching out and gripping the ground to pull her\nalong.\nLeave me here for now, Shallan thought to Pattern, gritting her teeth.\nWhen Mishram reached the other dying singer, her strange too-long\nlimbs puffed away into smoke, but the main mass of blackness remained.\nThat transformed into a singer femalen as if she were emerging from fog,\nwith billowing robes and long black hair. She leaned down over the dying\nsoldier, and extra arms formed to cradle the head and body.\nThey exchanged words, too soft for Shallan to hear. She forced herself to\nwait, but couldn’t help whimpering at the pain.\nMishram turned toward her. Shallan’s heart stumbled. That was the face\nshe’d seen in her drawings—in the sky, the smoke, the knots and grain of\nwood. Unlike Sja-anat, who tended to appear human—or as perhaps some\nkind of spren, with smooth skin and too-narrow features—Mishram was\nunabashedly singer. Some red lines of smoke made up her face, giving her\nan otherworldly carapace and patterns.\nShe fixated on Shallan, then again became a cloud of smoke with\nstretching arms. She pulled herself with that same unnatural gait up to\nShallan, and became a singer again.\nStorms.\nShould we bring you out? Pattern asked.\nShallan waited, her breath held, as Mishram loomed over her, arms\nforming from amorphous smoke at her sides to cradle Shallan. The Unmade\nleaned down, then breathed out, darkness wrapping around Shallan. Storms,\nit was … it was …\n“Live,” Mishram whispered, her voice somehow overlapping with a"

Storms,\nit was … it was …\n“Live,” Mishram whispered, her voice somehow overlapping with a\ndozen different rhythms. “Heal.”\nThe pain in her side vanished, and her body reknit. Nearby, she could see\nthe other singer stumbling to her feet, humming in amazement at her\nrestored body. They weren’t Regals with powers, let alone Fused. They\nwere common soldiers.\n“Why?” Shallan asked as Mishram gently lowered her to the ground.\n“He does not love us,” Mishram said. She looked to the sky, as if\nworried. “So we must love ourselves.” She became smoke again, long arms\nstretching across the battlefield as she looked for other wounded singers.\nShallan struggled to her feet. She’s healing people, she thought to\nPattern. Did any of you expect that?\nI try not to expect things that aren’t mathematically sure, Pattern said.\nPeople say that life tends to be irrational, but even irrational numbers can\nbe computed with ease. You all are something beyond that.\nStorms. More than irrational?\nWay more. Regardless, the others are fascinated by this. Rlain says that\nMishram was one of the main gods they rejected in leaving—so he didn’t\nexpect kindness from her. They want you to see if you can get any more\ninformation.\nShallan picked her way across the field to where Mishram healed\nanother near-dead singer. The malen put his hand to his head, where his\ncarapace had been cracked.\n“The other Unmade have plots,” Shallan said. “What are yours?”\n“You deserve,” she said—again with too many rhythms, “far better than\nhim. Live. Feel. Feel so much more than he allows. Be.” She turned away,\nlong arms quickly pulling her toward another fallen body.\nShallan looked to the other two who had been healed. They gathered\nwith her, watching Mishram.\n“I never know what to make of them,” the femalen said.\n“I saw Yelig-nar consume a dozen of our kind in one battle,” the malen\nwhispered to a morose rhythm. “My brother included. Now this one …\nheals us? They’re spren. Best not to try to understand them.”\n“She’s right though,” Shallan found herself saying. “Odium doesn’t care\nabout us.”\n“He cares about winning,” the femalen said. “If we want to live in peace,\nwe’ll need to kill the humans. It’s that or be destroyed.”\n“We could coexist,” Shallan said.\nBoth hummed to the same rhythm, which seemed mocking or skeptical.\nStorms, it was easier to pick those out in a singer body, wasn’t it?\n“Coexisting,” the malen said. “A fanciful dream. Sure, who wouldn’t\nprefer that?”\n“The humans slaughtered my sisters,” the femalen said. “It can’t happen.\nI won’t let it.”\nShallan crossed the field, and the other two didn’t stop or question her.\nThe singers didn’t maintain the same kind of discipline or expectations as\nhuman societies. Not that they were without conviction or prowess—but\nthey didn’t have the same hierarchies of commanders or ranks.\nShe approached Mishram, the grass ignoring her as she stepped on it."

There was a sense of freedom\nand individuality to their lives—something she’d never really noticed\nbefore watching them closely in these visions.\nAll this time she’d imagined them as destroyers, seeking to enslave\nhumankind. But humans were the ones who made slaves. Then again, from\nwhat she’d seen, humans had grander cities, more diversity of professions,\nand—strangely—more artists. Why should that be? Considering how free\nthey were, shouldn’t there be more artists among singers? Perhaps for art to\ntruly flourish, you needed certain kinds of infrastructure. A part of her hated\nthat idea, realistic though it sounded, and …\nAnd she let Radiant take control. Mishram had found a human this time,\nstill alive, blood on his lips as he lay there trembling, eyes squeezed shut\nagainst the monstrosity that loomed above him. He was muttering\nsomething, but Shallan—in the singer’s body—couldn’t understand it. The\nwords felt so dead to her without a rhythm.\n“Will you heal him?” she asked.\n“I cannot,” the Unmade said. “And I would not.” She hesitated. “Yet we\nshould sing for him. That will make his final transition more peaceful.”\nMishram leaned down and began to sing softly to the Rhythm of Peace.\nShallan’s anxiety lessened. The dying man stopped trembling, and his\nbreathing became more regular. He even … even seemed to hum to it\nhimself until he slipped away.\nShallan found tears in her eyes, and Mishram regarded her—strangely,\nthe spren didn’t turn so much as just shift until she was facing a different\ndirection.\n“You cry for them, singer?” Mishram asked.\n“I cry for all of us,” Shallan whispered. “And for the pain that we all\ncause one another. Is there no way to stop this, Mishram?”\n“He will never allow it, for the wars serve him, preparing his armies for\na future I do not yet understand. We must dominate the humans. That is\nfirst. They will not stop fighting until we are completely under their control,\nso we must accomplish that first.” She hesitated. “Then, perhaps.” The\nspren looked to the sky. “If he allows it … I wish that he would.”\nStorms. Shallan had grown to know, in a small way, Sja-anat—and had\nbriefly been forced to trust the spren. Yet in all her interactions with the\nUnmade, she had never seen one act so very human as Mishram did now,\nhumming softly for a dying enemy. Shallan reminded herself that Mishram\nwould eventually pick up the war against humankind in Odium’s absence.\nShe and Mishram were on opposite sides of this battlefield, but—\nMishram’s song changed.\nShallan stepped back in shock as the smoky figure began to vibrate and\npulse, her face distorting. “I see you,” it hissed. “I see you, Lightweaver.”"

That angry, twisted face. It wasn’t the Ba-\nAdo-Mishram of memory. It was the current one.\n“I will rip you to pieces,” Mishram said, advancing on her. “I will pull\nyour bones from their sockets and listen to them pop. I will crack your\nfingers backward, just to hear you scream. I will revel in the things that\nflow from you when sliced: pain and screams and bowels unchained. I—”\nWe’re getting you out, Pattern said.\nShallan was glad for that, but as it happened, she realized this was the\nmost interaction she’d had with Mishram. This was progress, terrifying\nthough it was—so she tried a Lightweaving as she was yanked free. She’d\nplanned it, and she thought it might—\nShe shook, finding herself on the scaffolding again. She scrambled up,\nignoring questions from Pattern and Rlain—instead peering at the vision.\nShe’d managed to create a Lightweaving of herself, as Shallan, that had\nappeared beside the soldier whose body she’d been inhabiting. The soldier\nwandered off, heading toward the other two who had been healed, to\ncontinue on as the historical event had played out.\nThe fake Shallan stayed in place, and she—outside—controlled it.\n“Why?” she whispered, making the Lightweaving say the same. With her\neyes closed, she was almost back inside. She couldn’t hear Mishram’s reply\nfrom out here, but Glys glided up to her and whispered what the Unmade\nsaid.\n“Why what?” Mishram replied. “Why do I hate you?”\n“No,” Shallan said. “We came to your world, and then fought you for it.\nWe imprisoned you for thousands of years. I know why you hate me.”\n“Then what?” Mishram said, Glys imitating her biting anger.\n“Why is Odium afraid of you?” Shallan said. “Could you actually\nreplace him?”\nStillness.\nThen Glys gasped.\nShallan trembled as she opened her eyes and found the swirling smoke-\npaint of the Spiritual Realm all around her, shifting behind her, flowing like\na thousand rivers smashing together. The eddies of their motion formed\nfaces, which all moved in unison.\n“How do you know?” Mishram demanded. “How do you know?”\n“I’ve been there,” Shallan whispered. “I killed those who created me as\nwell.”\nMishram’s essence flowed forward, colorful mist becoming darkness,\nbecoming hands that reached for Shallan. Whatever the nature of Mishram’s\nprison, it was weaker in here. Shallan was sure those hands had become\nreal, and would—\nRlain stepped between them.\nTall as a tower, with the armor of a singer and the uniform of an Alethi.\nHis spren joined him, faceless, hiding in his shadow.

Staring at …\nShallan had made a practice of studying eyelines for sketching. She was\nabsolutely certain that Mishram was staring at the way Renarin had taken\nRlain’s hand for support.\n“We are children of Sja-anat,” Glys said from behind Renarin. “You\nremember your sister?”\n“Help us find you,” Rlain demanded. “We cannot free you, but it will be\nbetter for everyone if you are found by us, and not by our enemies.”\nShallan’s breath caught. Yes, despite Renarin’s complaints, she did want\nto find the prison. If Mishram could actually threaten Odium … well, that\nwas a weapon worth having. And having Rlain agree with her was\nbolstering.\nMishram faded back into the swirling paint-smoke and vanished.\nShallan groaned and climbed to her feet. Then she noticed Pattern\nhumming nearby. He pointed back into the vision—which was still playing\nout. Testament stepped up beside Pattern, both of them looking at Shallan’s\nLightweaving through a clearer section of the glass.\nShallan’s illusions no longer froze when she wasn’t directing them. The\none inside, for example, had clasped its hands and was staring thoughtfully,\nshifting occasionally as a living person might.

A human soldier who gripped a\ndagger that warped the air.\nMraize. Shallan’s breath caught. He watched the illusory her, obviously\nprepared to run up and strike … but he hesitated. She was absolutely\ncertain he hesitated. She didn’t get to see for how long, as the vision soon\nended, and the glass pillar crumpled away.\nThen strangely, the ground beneath her feet darkened. Shallan took hold\nof Renarin so the three of them would be less likely to be separated. “What\nis that darkness?” she hissed.\n“It’s him,” Glys said. “Mishram seeing us has led Odium to notice\nsomething was wrong. He’s searching for us.”\n“We will hide,” Tumi said. “Take care, Shallan. We will find you soon.”\n“But—”\n“We will find you,” Tumi repeated.\nShe was cast into the shifting chaos.\nAlone.\nAdolin sat, left hand against his chin, staring at the complicated towers\nboard. They’d swapped to smaller cards to fit more on a table—each barely\nan inch.\nTwo practice swords were on the floor, and Yanagawn was still sweating\nfrom their sparring match. No Shardplate today—just good old-fashioned\nswordplay. Each time Adolin arrived, the Imperial Guards changed to ones\nled by Gezamal, Kushkam’s son. A great number of the standard guards\nwould have serious trouble with Adolin embarrassing their emperor during\ntraining. Thus, before his sessions, Kushkam switched them out.\nThat workout was finished, so now, as the welcome cool breeze of the\nevening darkness arrived—allowed in through the far side of the tent—it\nwas time for the more important lesson of the evening.

One in tactics.\n“Hmm …” Yanagawn said, surveying the board, letting out a\nconcentrationspren—like a water drop rippling the air behind him in circles.\n“I’m doomed.”\n“Are you?” Adolin asked.\n“You’ve proven to me, time and time again, that the larger force wins.\nNot just by a linear amount either.”\n“Explain.”\nYanagawn eyed him, then pointed at the board. “I currently have a\nhundred thousand troops. You have a hundred and twenty thousand.”\n“But you started with more.”\n“You always let me start at the advantage.”\n“So the larger force doesn’t always win?”\n“I should say,” Yanagawn replied, “that all other factors being equal—\nincluding the skill of their leader—the larger force wins. Is that correct?”\n“And not just by a linear amount,” Adolin said. “That’s relevant.”\nThe emperor nodded, in his training robe looking like an ordinary youth.\nHis black hair was six inches long; when not trapped under extravagant\nheadgear it could flare outward in that uniquely Makabaki way.\n“Two equal forces smashing against one another,” Yanagawn said softly,\n“will both suffer huge casualties. But if one force is even ten or twenty\npercent larger, something strange happens. The casualties on the other side\nmultiply. Two hundred against one hundred doesn’t result in one hundred\ndead on each side—it results in a hundred dead on the smaller side, and\nmaybe only twenty dead on the larger side. The more overwhelming your\nforce, the more protected each man is.”\n“Assuming,” Adolin said, “both forces fight until one is utterly\nannihilated—which is extremely rare. Armies will usually break after ten to\nfifteen percent losses. That’s not cowardice; it’s human nature.” He leaned\nforward. “A good general understands the stakes. Almost nothing is worth\nfighting for until you’re all dead.”\n“So I should retreat on this board,” Yanagawn said. “You have an\noverwhelming size advantage, so I’ll lose.”\n“Will you, though?” Adolin asked.\nTo his credit, Yanagawn didn’t get exasperated by Adolin’s pushing. He\nstudied further, taking his time.\nGezamal, wearing his Imperial Guard uniform with the extra patterns,\nhad moved over so he could view the board. The man was an expert towers\nplayer; he would immediately see what Adolin was teaching. Yanagawn,\nhowever, needed a hint.\n“Look for your troops,” Adolin said, “who have an advantage.”\n“These here,” Yanagawn said, pointing to a line of troops at the front of\nhis formation. “They have an advantage still. Representing, I believe, high\nground.”\n“And what is high ground?”\n“A force multiplier,” Yanagawn said. “These spearmen, particularly\nfighting defensively, can hold against a larger force. But Adolin, this is only\na small portion of my army; you think I should keep them here so the others\ncan retreat?”\nAdolin waited, saying nothing.\n“… No,” Yanagawn said softly, then made his move.

Redeploying the\ntroops with an advantage to defensive postures, turning their cards around.\nHe’d seen. Adolin’s troops were split between those on the field and a\nsmaller force of reserves coming in from behind. Yanagawn’s troops, in\nturn, were split between the small portion on the hilltop and the larger\nportion within striking distance of Adolin’s reserves.\nOver the next few moves, Yanagawn positioned his larger force against\nAdolin’s reserves—counting on his hilltop defensive troops to hold back the\nrest for a time, as they couldn’t pass without taking huge losses. They held\nlong enough for the bulk of his troops to surround and begin destroying\nAdolin’s reserves—which Adolin had deliberately left exposed for the\nlesson.\n“I see …” Yanagawn said. “I thought it was my one hundred against\nyour one twenty. But with this maneuver, I leave twenty of mine to hold\nback the bulk of yours—while my eighty destroy your arriving forty.”\n“You’d take some casualties among your defensive troops,” Adolin said,\n“but in the end, I’d be left with the smaller overall army. Now I, seeing that,\nam the one who has to withdraw.”\n“I’ve been told, Adolin,” Gezamal said, squatting down by the table,\n“that you can turn almost any position into a winning one. These scenarios\nhappen in real life—not as clearly, not as cleanly, but they are real. I’ve read\nof them.”\n“I’ve lived them,” Adolin said. “It works—separate enemy forces, gang\nup on the smaller one … It’s a good tactic, and one every military\ncommander should know. Watch for chances to turn the battle in your favor,\nYanagawn. Because almost any fight can be won.”\nHe began gathering the cards.\n“Is that applicable to our own circumstances?” Yanagawn said, looking\ntoward the side of the tent—toward the dome. They could faintly hear\nfighting inside, though the hour was growing late. Adolin had spent hours in\nthere today; as the enemy troops grew more confident with their position,\nthey now kept almost constant pressure against the defenders.\n“Yes,” Adolin said. “We can win this, Yanagawn.”\n“Our troops are exhausted,” Yanagawn said.\n“Fresh ones should arrive within the day,” Adolin replied. “Plus, we’re in\nan advantageous spot. You can’t always see your whole battlefield like we\ncan here in the dome—and you can rarely manage it so well. Towers is an\nexcellent training method, but it’s a little too formal, a little too structured.”\n“I’ve heard my father say the same, Adolin,” Gezamal said. “On a real\nbattlefield, troops get bogged down, or maneuver wrong, or orders arrive\nafter the situation has changed.” He paused. “I think I’d struggle with true\nbattlefield strategy—I’m too used to having exacting control over my\npieces.”\n“I’m sure you’d do better than you think,” Yanagawn said.\n“Thank you,” Gezamal replied.

He stood up straight, and grew very quiet. It wasn’t wrong to\naddress the emperor if spoken to, but it was a breach—it seemed—for such\nan exchange to happen with a guard.\n“It’s all right,” Adolin said to Gezamal. “We’re all friends in this tent.”\n“No, it’s not,” Gezamal said, very stiff-backed.\nAdolin sighed, but he didn’t push. He expected other military leaders to\nput up with the way he led his troops—he should probably try a little harder\nto appreciate the Azish system.\n“Adolin,” Yanagawn said, leaning forward to help gather the cards. “You\nalways give me the advantage at the start of a game. I wonder if we should\ntry it another way. My uncle, when I was … living my previous life …\nalways said hardship made a man grow. If I start in a winning position, how\nwill I learn?”\n“We’ll move on to other training structures eventually,” Adolin\npromised. “But Yanagawn, let me share something my father once told me.\nHe said that if he had ten generals who could always win from a superior\nposition, he could rule the world. Do not discount how difficult it is to\nmaintain a lead. Too many generals throw away winning positions because\nof bad fundamentals.”\n“All right,” he said.\n“You talked earlier about the stronger force always winning, but we just\nproved that’s not the case. Indeed, there’s an old list we call Valithar’s\nDictates. He said there are three primary ways that a general loses from a\nnumerical advantage. Can you name any of them?”\n“Terrain?” Yanagawn guessed. “An inferior force with better\nfortifications can beat a superior force. In today’s game, I was able to use\nthe land against you.”\n“Excellent,” Adolin said.\n“A second one …” Yanagawn said, “involves leadership or training? I\nlost early games because I was incompetent.”\n“One general doesn’t have to be incompetent to lose to another that is\nbetter, but yes, that is one of the three. Superior troops or leadership can\nchange a losing position into a winning one. And the third?”\nYanagawn thought awhile, then shook his head.\n“Random chance,” Adolin said. “A strong line can buckle because a\nsingle soldier loses his footing. A powerful force can have its supply lines\nswept away by unexpected flooding, leaving its soldiers hungry and at a\ndisadvantage.”\n“Frustrating,” Yanagawn said.\n“Life,” Adolin replied. Then he paused. “Technically, there is a fourth\nway a stronger force frequently loses to a weaker one, though it’s not one\nValithar outlined. We’ll talk about that later. For now, focus on these three.”\n“I will,” Yanagawn promised. Then he hesitated. “Adolin?”\n“Yes?”\n“Will I ever be able to use any of this?” The emperor sat back in his\ncushioned seat on the floor before their low table.

A servant brought wine,\ndelivering it to another servant, who poured it, and in turn gave it to the\nservant who today was designated as worthy to present it to the emperor.\n“Depends,” Adolin said, pouring himself some wine—orange, because\nhis father had gotten to him—and lying back on his own cushions. “We\nhope to never have to use this in real life. War finds us nonetheless.”\n“Your father is building us a lasting peace,” Yanagawn said. “If we hold\nhere until the deadline arrives, then Azir is free. But either way, the war\nwith the singers ends. Doesn’t it?”\n“That’s how it appears,” Adolin said.\n“So when will I use any of this?”\n“Well,” Adolin said, “there’s the joy of the game. Have you enjoyed\nlearning towers?”\n“Immensely.”\n“Then you can keep playing,” Adolin said, sipping his wine. He gazed\nupward, thoughtful, imagining the sky past the tent’s top. “What do you\nmake of what the contract implies? About … war out there?”\n“Other worlds?” Yanagawn said. “We have legends about them, in our\nrecords. We record everything, and there are so many stories that confirm\nthis if you look for them.”\n“Really?” Adolin said, perking up.\n“Firsthand accounts of people who traveled here,” Yanagawn said,\n“traversing a great darkness that sounds an awful lot like Shadesmar. I had\nmy scribes gather them all, and the weight of them together … it’s rather\nconvincing. We all thought so, right, Noura?” He turned, but she wasn’t\nthere. She still left during the training. “Anyway,” Yanagawn continued,\n“seeing it all together, it’s remarkable we didn’t understand this earlier.\nMakes me wonder if anyone close to us is secretly one of them. A person\nfrom another world.”\n“His name is Wit,” Adolin said. “And he’s kind of a jerk.”\nYanagawn smiled. “We have legends about him too. Most records call\nhim an emissary of Yaezir, but it’s clear he’s been interfering for millennia.”\nHe paused, looking down at his wine. “Wit, our emissary of the gods, is just\n… a man. I spoke to him only last week. We worship Yaezir—or as you call\nhim, Jezerezeh—yet it seems he never was God … and that he might be\ndead anyway.”\n“Yeah,” Adolin said. “I … do think about that.”\n“What does it mean?” Yanagawn asked. “What do you believe, in the\nface of all of this?”\nWhat did he believe? Storms, that was a good question. How long had it\nbeen since he’d paid for prayers, gone to the devotary, or done any of the\nother things he was supposed to do? One would think that with literal\nVoidbringers coming down to assault the land, he’d be more devout, not\nless. But then his father had gone and upended religion itself and … and\nAdolin was left wondering. If there were gods, or an Almighty, or\nsomething … shouldn’t Adolin be getting a little help now and then? He\nwas trying to protect the world."

He\nwas trying to protect the world.\nThose kinds of worries unnerved him on a fundamental level. As he\nconsidered, he felt something from Maya—distant though she was. A kind\nof comfort.\nThey continued playing, and some servants brought Yanagawn food—\nletting him take a short break to dine. Not a formal dinner, just some\nsnacks.\n“Silver plates?” Adolin asked with a smile. “And forks?”\n“Worse, or better,” Yanagawn said, raising a small fork he was using\nwith one hand. A servant took it, stabbed a small fruit, then handed it back.\n“Aluminum.”\n“Aluminum?” Adolin said. “You have aluminum dining ware?”\n“And finery,” Yanagawn said, gesturing to some of the nearby\ncandelabras holding ceremonial candles. “This one here was made from a\nstar that fell during my predecessor’s days—we used to call it starmetal.\nMore valuable than any gemstone or other metal. Only the finest for the\nemperor.”\n“We could use that,” Adolin said, thoughtful. “It blocks Shardblades, and\nhas other applications.”\nYanagawn paused. “I hadn’t really thought about that. Maybe I should\nhave—especially when they started coating my bedrooms in plates of it to\nprotect from the Fused.” He turned from his meal and gave instructions for\npeople to begin gathering the metal to take to the armorers. The enemy\nhadn’t used any Shardblades in this fight, but who knew? A few shields\nbanded in the stuff might be useful.\nAdolin was thinking on this as his guards swapped. He wasn’t surprised\nwhen Hmask—happy and smiling—was in the new rotation.\n“Good to see you, my friend,” Adolin said to him.\nHmask merely nodded.\n“Wish I knew what your story was,” Adolin said idly.\nYanagawn, accepting another drink, looked over. Then he spoke to\nHmask directly—his guards and aides were slowly getting used to this—in\nwhat sounded like perfect Thaylen.\nHmask, surprised, replied. He spoke quickly and eagerly.\n“Interesting,” Yanagawn said in Azish. “Adolin, do you remember a\nmoment during the Battle of Thaylen Field when you were in a building and\na large monster was attacking it?”\n“Thunderclast,” Adolin said. “Yeah. I wasn’t able to beat it. Honestly, I\nbarely inconvenienced it.” He thought back to that whole ordeal with shame\nat his failure.\nHmask kept talking.\n“There was a boy,” Yanagawn said, “in a building that was breaking and\ncrumbling. Do you remember?”\nAdolin paused, picturing it.\nA whimper. An overturned table. Thunderclast footfalls, shaking chips\nfrom the ceiling. A young boy.\n“I remember,” Adolin said, and Yanagawn interpreted.\nHmask knelt, mustaches and eyebrows wagging, and took Adolin’s hand.\n“Son,” he said in Alethi. “Me. Son. You.” He pressed his forehead to\nAdolin’s hand. “Me. Son. You.”"

You.”\n“I think,” Yanagawn said, “you saved his son’s life.”\nHmask stood up, tears in his eyes, and slapped his chest. He then\nreturned to his stance by the exit. Until now, Adolin had forgotten that\nmoment in Thaylen City. Storms.\nBefore he could think further though, a pair of Azish scribes arrived in a\nflurry. Adolin sat up, alarmed. These were dressed as Azish information\ngatherers. He was pretty sure they ran the local spanreed hub for the\nemperor.\nThey weren’t looking for him, however. They asked for Noura, then left\nwhen she wasn’t there.\n“What was that?” Adolin said.\n“Hmm?” Yanagawn said. “They would have said something if it was\nimportant.”\nAdolin excused himself, pushing out into the night. He spotted the two\nmoving to another lit tent and tried to follow them in, but was stopped by\nguards.\nHe gritted his teeth until Noura called from within. “He may enter.”\nAdolin pushed past the men and found her at a desk with several other\nviziers. The two scribes he’d seen earlier stood there, swarming with\nanxietyspren like twisting black crosses. They’d delivered spanreed\nwritings to Noura.\n“What kind of important news,” he said, “causes the lead scribes of the\nspanreed hub to run to you personally?”\nNoura looked to him, then drew her lips to a line. Somehow Adolin\nknew—from that grim expression—that this wasn’t information from\nUrithiru about the war effort at large; it was specific to Azir.\n“The reinforcements,” he guessed. “They aren’t going to arrive in time.”\n“You,” Noura said, “are smarter than your reputation suggests,\nHighprince.”\nHis stomach sank. Even though he’d planned for this, expected it for\ndays … well, you anticipated the worst case, but you did not want to have\nto encounter it.\n“What happened?” he demanded.\n“Betrayal,” she said. “Emul and Tashikk have turned on us.”\nEmul and Tashikk? Two of the subject nations in the Azish empire. The\ncoalition had expended huge efforts to protect Emul from conquest recently.\nThat was why the bulk of their armies were away, needing to march to\nAzimir.\n“The phantom force that struck at our reinforcement,” he said. “They\nwere our own people.”\n“Supposedly our own,” Noura said. Nearby a spanreed was writing\nfuriously. Adolin waited as she read it, then met his eyes. “From the prime\nof Emul. A formal declaration of secession. It seems … they’ve made their\nown deal with Odium. I suspect we’ll get the same from Tashikk.”\nThe dagger of those words cut deeply, and Adolin attracted a spren he\nnever had before—in all his years. Like snapping strings expanding from\nhim.

Though the bulk of the forty thousand\ntroops marching to their rescue were Alethi and Azish, the entire remaining\nforce from the two subject nations had turned against them—and were\nharrying them, slowing them. It would be enough to keep the army from\narriving in time.\n“Storms,” he whispered. “How could they? Why?”\n“Evidently,” Noura said, reading a letter from the Tashikki prime,\n“Odium offered them a deal with some small measure of autonomy—and\nthey decided to take that instead of waiting on the results of the battle here.\nI fear … they assumed that if Azir won, it would reinforce our imperial\nclaim, and that we might push for stronger oversight and taxation. They saw\nthemselves as picking between two bad choices, and took the sure one.”\nAdolin sat there, his stomach churning, his nerves taut as he tried to find\na way out of this mess. He’d never expected their allies—those they’d\nfought to protect—to turn on them. It meant … storms, this was a brilliant\nmove on Odium’s part. He’d known the Azish empire was only tenuously\nunited, and had struck precisely in a way to give the smaller parties some\nconcessions so he could dominate the larger one.\n“The enemy is isolating us, Noura,” he said. “He’s looking to suffocate\nus.”\nHe felt the winds behind him grow still, and he could make out the\nshouts of men fighting in the dome. Men who were exhausted, barely\nholding on.\nMen who would have to hold out for three and a half more days.\nBecause no help was coming.\nBut I will say that for me, the existence of something that cares—\nand can, after death, make up for injustices in life—is not the\nquestion. But the answer.\n—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar\nKholin. Excerpt used at his tribunal, in absentia—for\nthe appeal filed on his behalf by supporters after his\nexcommunication from the Vorin church—as evidence\nof continued heresy.\nDalinar was cast into the Spiritual Realm.\nThis time it was different. Though he tried to keep hold of Navani and\nGav, he lost them in the rush.\nThey’d been moving from Desolation to Desolation, making their way\ntoward the Recreance. Then, just now, a shadow had fallen over the vision.\nCausing it to end abruptly.\nImages of his past came more quickly, more violently than before.\nArmored versions of him stomped through landscapes, fracturing them like\na shattered mirror, only for another version of him to rip that reality apart,\ndrunkenly weeping over his faults.\nHe clutched the Honorblade anchor, but didn’t use it yet. He … he\nneeded to find Navani. He searched fervently for the line of light\nConnecting them, but the sea of overlapping images crashed against him in\nwaves, blinding him. It was the ocean, and he a poor sailor on the rocks.\nThose waves were made up of thousands of versions of him, boiling\nfrom the surf that was this strange place, the swirling colors and\nshimmering essence.\nBe me, each of them demanded.

He hunkered down before them, his eyes squeezed closed.\n“Stormfather,” he whispered. “Please.”\nI will help, the Stormfather replied, if you leave this realm and never\nreturn.\nDalinar blinked and saw a figure breaking the tide in front of him. The\nfigure shifted, changing shapes faintly—while keeping the same general\nform.\n“Why?” Dalinar whispered. “Why are you so afraid?”\nI had a plan. I need you to trust me.\n“Trust you?” Dalinar said, surging forward through the thousands of\nlandscapes that appeared and vanished. “How can I trust you? You had a\nplan for all this? What plan?”\nThe figure didn’t respond. So, desperate, Dalinar held the Honorblade\nclose. Take me, he thought, to my destination. I need to go further than I\nhave before. Far further …\nHe fell in a heap, and a new reality burst into being. He felt the\nHonorblade vanish from his grip—and he cried out as it did. He … he was\nalone, on a burning section of rock, with taller formations and clumps of\nstone here and there. A scent of burned flesh pervaded the air.\nDalinar knew this place. It was one of his original visions—the one\nwhere he’d discovered the discarded Honorblades after the Heralds walked\naway from them. The … ultimate end of his anchor, and the reason it had\nvanished after bringing him here. He had reached the day the Blades had\nbeen discarded.\nHe got to his knees in the shadow of a dying thunderclast. Jezrien the\nHerald was standing tall on a short ridge perhaps twenty yards away. The\nking looked more regal than he had in the earlier visions, but perhaps that\nwas the kingly clothing: white and blue, without furs, the cloth more refined\nthan it had been in antiquity. The outfit was marred with blood and ash, but\nthat was something Dalinar associated with kingship.\n“Chana,” Jezrien called to him. “Here.”\nSo, he was in her body this time? The red-haired bodyguard? He had the\nimpression she was in Jezrien’s inner circle, even among the Heralds. She,\nJezrien, and Ishar. Dalinar trotted over to join Jezrien on the ridge. From\nthere, he saw armies hunting among the fallen for survivors.\nWhere was Navani? Would she find her way to this vision as well?\nStorms. He checked his arm bracer. They were on the sixth day; four\nremaining. He’d learned so much about Honor and the Oathpact from these\nvisions, but the primary secret kept eluding him: how could he persuade\nthat power to accept him as its new master?\nHe tried to reach out for his Connection to Navani, to pull her to him, but\nfound nothing. He was torn between trying to find her and Gav, or\ncontinuing, because Jezrien was walking onward."

He was torn between trying to find her and Gav, or\ncontinuing, because Jezrien was walking onward.\nBefore, when Dalinar had seen this vision, he’d arrived after the Heralds\nhad abandoned their oaths. If he went with Jezrien, he could see the actual\nmoment that had happened. Could this relate to Honor and his power? It felt\nlikely.\n“Hurry,” Jezrien said. “Ishar is at the meeting place already. I want to get\nthere before the others.”\nDalinar joined him. Worried about Navani, but hoping she was already in\nthe body of another Herald.\n“Did you see any of the others?” Jezrien asked. “Maybe Kalak? I think\neveryone else survived. We’re doing it again—we aren’t taking risks. We\nhide from battle. Everyone except …”\n“Except Taln,” Dalinar said.\nJezrien nodded. “I sent Battar and Vedel to check on my daughter,\nmostly to keep them busy. We need to make our decision quickly, before\nthey start trickling back.”\n“Decision …” He knew what Jezrien referred to: this would be the\ndecision not to leave for Braize. The decision to leave Taln alone to bear the\nOathpact.\nCowardice. Except he saw the way Jezrien gazed down at the ground as\nhe spoke. Saw the way his hands trembled, and how he had to make fists to\nhide it. Suddenly, instead of regal, he appeared haggard. Overwhelmed.\nWho was Dalinar to judge what thousands of years of torture could do to a\nman?\n“Jezrien,” he said, “I still, so many centuries later, don’t understand how\nall of this works. Is it idiocy of me to admit?”\n“No,” Jezrien said softly. “No, I suppose it isn’t. It’s courage, Chana.\nYou should understand before we make this decision.”\n“How does our dying trap the Fused?” Dalinar said.\n“Braize,” he said. “The planet. It draws souls to it naturally. Honor\nfashioned it into a prison, but a prison needs a lock.”\n“And … we are that lock?” Dalinar asked.\n“Our oath is that lock. Because Odium first Connected to us when he\ngave us powers on Ashyn, Honor could use that bond against him. That,\nalong with the promise we made, becomes the force that holds the Fused.”\nJezrien’s eyes seemed distant. “It is … what the gods do. We form a binding\nthrough our willpower, holding the others we are Connected to—our\nreplacements in a way—to Braize. Impossible, save for the strange nature\nof that planet lending our ten oaths a multiplicative strength.”\n“But unless all ten of us return, they can be reborn.”\n“Yes,” Jezrien said. “Normally. All ten …”\nDalinar thought he understood, as he’d seen some of it through these last\nvisions. The Heralds would appear, then lead the people and help them\nfight.

Then the Heralds had to go and\nlock the Fused away.\nThus, they never saw the true end of a Desolation. The Heralds\nfrequently waited for a large battle—where lots of Fused had died—to go\ntogether to Braize and begin the Isolation. And beyond that, if one of them\ndied and remained on Braize, that slowed the Fused. The more who did, the\nslower the enemy returned.\nSo to win a Desolation, they trained the humans, they killed as many\nFused as possible, then they began staying in Damnation … reforging the\nlock. Until one of them broke in torture, and the floodgates opened again,\nletting the Fused begin the process to return to Roshar. At that point, the\nHeralds—exhausted—would return, starting the cycle once more.\nA cycle that repeated until this last Desolation. When the nine had left\nthe one.\nThey arrived in the natural hollow near a tall rock formation—almost\nlike a castle—that offered some seclusion from the battlefield. This was\nwhere Dalinar had seen the vision of the Honorblades rammed into the\nground.\nIshar was waiting for them.\nAnd he was chatting with Honor.\nDalinar stopped in place, feeling a jolt of excitement. He was still on the\nright track. This was Aharietiam, some four or five thousand years before\nDalinar’s time, perhaps two or three thousand years before the day he most\nwanted to see: when the Knights Radiant had walked away, and Honor had\nbeen killed. That was a long time off, yes—but this was a good step.\nI need to find Navani, he thought. I’ll need her help to decipher all of\nthis.\nJezrien joined Ishar. Honor was once again dressed in gold, his brown\nskin and white hair offering a distinctive contrast. Dalinar stumbled up after\nthem.\n“Lord,” Jezrien said. “Almighty. Did you … hear what we were\nconsidering?”\n“Ishar’s plan,” Honor said. “Not to return to Braize.”\n“We … we apologize for our weakness,” Jezrien said, looking away,\nsqueezing his eyes shut, drawing shamespren. “But Lord, it’s so hard. We\ncan’t … I mean, the mere thought of …”\n“We’re broken,” Ishar whispered. “We need you to change the bond.\nTake it from us.”\n“Break the Oathpact?” Honor asked.\n“Change it, so that others can take our place,” Ishar said. “Or … or\nmaybe make it allow half of us to hold the bond for one Isolation, then trade\nwith the other half …”\n“Five?” Honor said. “No, impossible. Five is a number of weakness. No\nsymmetry, no power. Perhaps four would work. The number of\nAdonalsium’s four aspects. Or ten, sixteen … one.”\nDalinar felt cold. “One?”\n“One cosmere,” Honor said. “One Truth. One Adonalsium. A number of\npower and strength.”\n“One …” Ishar whispered. “One could remain?”"

Like a soldier in the lead of a formation.”\n“But—” Dalinar started.\n“Regardless,” Honor said, “I will no longer be aiding you as you go\nforward, Heralds. My part in this conflict is done.”\n“What do we do?” Jezrien asked.\nStorms, Honor had been here? And had nurtured the seed of their\nbetrayal of Taln?\n“I cannot afford to care any longer,” Honor said. “I can’t afford to care\nabout any of you. I need … distance. Yes.”\n“But Lord,” Ishar said, stepping forward, “what do we tell the people?”\n“Do as you wish.” Honor vanished—no fanfare, no flash.\n“That is it,” Jezrien said, making a small gesture with his hand—more\nsubtle than the ones Dalinar had seen before.\n“You’ll abandon him,” Dalinar whispered. “Now that you know one can\ndo it alone.”\n“Not fully alone,” Ishar said. “We will … support him … from this\nworld.”\n“I still wish others could take our place,” Jezrien said.\n“I will find a way to replace us,” Ishar said. “But it will take time,\nJezrien. For now, we leave Taln.”\nJezrien looked sick.\n“Could you go to Damnation instead of him?” Ishar said, looking from\nhim to Dalinar. “Can either of you go?”\n“I …” Dalinar said. He didn’t want to break the vision. “I don’t know.”\n“I can’t do it,” Jezrien whispered. Then summoned his sword and gazed\nat it, pain evident on his face. “But neither can I carry this in good\nconscience after abandoning a friend. When all but Taln have gathered, I\nwill leave my Blade here, never to take it up again. I can wield Honor no\nlonger.” His face seemed to grow more pale. “I feel it, Ishar. I feel myself\n… putting my burden upon him.” He glanced toward where the Almighty\nhad been standing. “I thought … I thought he’d fix it …”\n“Our god is no longer reliable,” Ishar said, then took a deep breath. “I\nwill do what I can in his absence.” Ishar put his hand on Jezrien’s shoulder.\n“I first bore Surges. I initiated the Oathpact. I am the Bondsmith. I can bear\nsome of your pain.” He looked to Dalinar. “I can bear part of it for each of\nyou.”\n“I can’t let you do that, Ishar,” Jezrien said.\n“Why not? You are willing to abandon Taln. We all are.” Ishar’s\nexpression softened. “Someone may need to step into Honor’s place. I can\nexplore that possibility. Please, give me some of your pain.”"

They turned as other figures came stumbling up to the meeting\nplace. Vedel, Ash, Battar. None appeared to be Navani or Gav.\nDalinar backed away and sat on the stone ground. If the Almighty had\nbeen willing to support you, maybe change the members of the Oathpact,\nthis could have been avoided. So why? Why does he seem to be actively\nworking against us?\nOthers arrived, everyone but Nale and Kalak. Dalinar closed his eyes\nand focused on his Connections. He breathed in and out. Whatever darkness\nhad been overshadowing him faded away. The web of lines of light\nreturned, extending from him, binding him to the people he loved …\nNavani and Gav appeared on the ground before him—and unlike\neverything else here, they didn’t form from swirling Stormlight. Instead the\nair appeared to part around them, like dust being swept back on the stone\nfloor—or even drapes being opened. Revealing them behind a layer of\nreality, as if they’d always been there.\n“You found us,” Navani said, relieved, holding Gav.\n“As you found me before,” Dalinar said. He checked his arm clock\nagain, and saw it had barely moved. Storms, he could age decades in here if\nhe wasn’t careful, while minutes passed outside. That would almost be as\nbad as the opposite. “It’s near the end of the sixth day, Navani. I just learned\nthat Honor abandoned the Heralds in the moments before they walked away\nfrom their swords.” He frowned. “Ishar did something I hadn’t known\nabout: he took some of the pain of the others, and carried it himself. Maybe\nthat is why he seems so unreliable during our time.”\nNavani hugged Gav tighter, and Dalinar gave them a moment to recover.\nSome of the lines of white light connected to his core were fading; two\nstrong ones pointed to Navani and Gav, but a few others stood out—one in\nparticular as strong as his line to Navani. Curious. And there was another,\ndrifting off into nothing, that felt … familiar. The Stormfather.\nDalinar followed it with his eyes, spotting a shimmering in the air\nnearby.

Is that what this is?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, pulling back, surprised—again—at Gav’s maturity.\nThe ardents still at Urithiru were those who had chosen Dalinar’s way, over\nthe more orthodox branches of the religion forming in reaction to his\nteachings. Those who remained revered him on a level that probably should\nhave made him uncomfortable.\n“I thought so.” Gav pointed toward the gathered Heralds. “Aunt Dova is\nhere. Should we talk to her?”\n“Wait,” Dalinar said. “Aunt Dova? You know her?”\nHe nodded. “She visited Mother. Sometimes.”\nA Herald had been visiting Aesudan? Dalinar frowned, looking at\nNavani, who knelt beside him.\n“You’re sure, Gav?” she asked.\nHe nodded, his eyes wide.\n“I think, lad,” Dalinar said, “she’s just a pretend version of … Aunt\nDova.”\nThe boy merely nodded again. “I’ll watch, Grampa,” he whispered.\n“Like you. God trained you. He’ll train me too. To be a king. To kill those\nwho killed Daddy.”\nStorms. Once they were through this, he’d chat with the lad, try to help\nhim with those feelings. For now, he and Navani stood, and he nodded\ntoward “Aunt Dova.”\n“Any idea why she might have visited the palace?” he asked.\n“No idea,” Navani said. “I don’t recognize her though. So I didn’t see\nher there.” She thought a moment. “What happened? How did we lose track\nof each other during this transition between visions?”\n“There was a darkness in the last one,” Dalinar said. “And it fell apart. I\nused the sword to get here, then it evaporated.”\n“It wouldn’t be viable after this anyway; the Heralds’ swords will no\nlonger be as tied to important events. We’ll need another anchor to progress.\nDo you know who you are replacing?”\n“Chana,” he said.\n“And me?” Navani asked.\nDalinar shook his head. “Nobody was with me when you appeared there.\nMaybe they’ll see you as a spren, like Gav.”\nNavani, seeming thoughtful, brushed herself off and went to listen in on\nthe Heralds. They were talking over the plan.\n“Grampa,” Gav whispered, “when can we go home? I will listen … I\nwill be strong. But … do you know?”"

But … do you know?”\n“Stormfather?” Dalinar asked, giving the boy another hug.\nNo response.\n“S !” Dalinar said, allowing the authority of storms to well up\nTORMFATHER\nwithin him. He didn’t know how he did it.\nWhat? the Stormfather said in his mind, and the shimmering moved\ncloser to him.\n“Take the boy out of here,” Dalinar said to it. “At least let him find\npeace.”\nYour recklessness brought him here.\n“You could send him home.”\nYou could bring him home.\nDalinar gritted his teeth.\nThis might scar him, the Stormfather said. What he sees could be\nhorrible. Don’t you care?\n“Of course I care!” Dalinar snapped. “But I’m a king. I can’t think of the\none; it’s my duty to think of the people as a whole. I’m close to the power\nof Honor. I can feel it. With it, I can defeat Odium. But if I leave now—for\nGav or Navani, or even myself—I fail everyone else as a result!”\nIs that actually your reason, the Stormfather demanded, or is it because\nyou need to be right? Is it because you need to be the one who makes the\ndecisions, who has the final say?\nDalinar didn’t reply. For all the spren claimed it didn’t see or do things\nthe way that men did—that it didn’t understand the ways of humankind—it\nwas expert at deflecting conversations and diverting Dalinar’s attention.\nDalinar looked back at the second shimmering he’d seen earlier. “That’s\nyou, isn’t it? You were here watching, when the Heralds broke the\nOathpact.”\nI had to witness it, the Stormfather said.\nStorms, it was so hard to sort through the lies—in previous\nconversations, the Stormfather claimed he’d merely been a primal force\nduring this era. A wind that blew with the storms, personified by human\nattention. He’d said he hadn’t developed a full personality until Honor’s\ndeath, when he’d inherited some of Honor’s memories.\nYet the Stormfather had been here. Dalinar would have to discuss this\nwith Navani. He glanced at her, and found that she was waving her hand in\nfront of Jezrien’s face—getting no reaction.\n“You’re right,” she called to Dalinar. “They noted me as a spren, but now\nwon’t even acknowledge me. I think the vision is pretending I’m not here.\nAs happened with Gav, after you pulled him into a vision.”\nDalinar nodded in thought.\n“Grampa,” Gav said softly, “were you hearing someone in your head?\nJust now, before talking to Gram?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “I was talking to the Stormfather. He’s a friendly\nspren, son.”\n“I hear Daddy sometimes. Telling me I’m a good boy.”\n“Listen to voices like that, Gav,” Dalinar whispered.\nNavani returned and settled down beside Dalinar. “I don’t know if being\nignored is better or worse. I can walk around without distracting them, but I"

I can walk around without distracting them, but I\ncan’t ask questions.”\n“What does it mean that Honor left the Heralds?” Dalinar asked her. “Is\nit tied to his death? And to why the power hasn’t attached to anyone in all\nthese years?”\n“I don’t know,” she said.\nNale arrived—and the others welcomed him, friendly. Their attitudes\ntoward one another had changed over the millennia. Nale took the news of\ntheir imminent disbanding with a nod. He asked after Kalak—who they\nfeared might have died, though Dalinar knew he would arrive eventually—\nthen left his sword. He paused with his hand on it for a moment and\nexhaled, shivering as something seemed to pass from him. He walked away\nwithout a further word, the first of them to leave. He would later, Dalinar\nknew, reclaim his weapon—as would Ishar.\n“What can we use as an anchor to the next vision?” Dalinar asked. “I\nworry this one will fall apart as soon as all the Heralds leave their swords.”\n“Hopefully we won’t lose one another again,” Navani said. She thought\na moment, then pressed her hand to his chest. He frowned until he saw what\nshe was doing—concentrating, strengthening the power of the line of light\nConnecting them.\nUnite them. Dalinar still occasionally heard echoes of that command\nvibrating through him. He thought that hadn’t come from the Stormfather or\nHonor, but from a god that once had existed, and might yet, if not in a form\npeople recognized. He had no evidence other than his own feelings. But he\nhad written—he hoped convincingly—of those experiences in his book.\n“There,” Navani said, pulling her hand away. “That might make it easier\nfor us to find one another.”\n“We can’t go back to searching for a new anchor each vision. That was\ntoo slow—not to mention maddening.”\n“Wit said this was the best way.”\n“He said this was a way,” Dalinar said, standing up. “But Wit’s not a\nBondsmith; he can’t manipulate Connection.” He looked to that shimmer of\nthe real Stormfather. “The Stormfather, the real one, told me he had to\nwatch this event when it actually happened. Because it was too important\nnot to witness. If he watched this, do you suppose …”\nShe frowned. “Was he even alive before Honor died?”\n“I get confusing answers to that question,” Dalinar said. “Wait for me;\nI’m going to try something.”\nDalinar stalked toward that shimmer, and as he did, the vision started to\nbreak apart. Shifting Stormlight began to claim it, but Dalinar seized hold\nof that line of light Connecting him to the Stormfather. He held tight,\npulling on it, like he was holding a horse’s reins.\nThe vision stabilized around him.\nWhat are you doing? the Stormfather said, trepidatious.\n“You know what we need to see next,” Dalinar said. “I can use you to\nget there.”\nYou cannot win Honor’s power through force of will, Dalinar, the"

Your brother tried to force his way to his goals, and he\nended up broken.\n“What do you know about my brother?” Dalinar demanded. “How many\nlies have you told me?”\nOnly the ones you needed to hear.\n“You can lead me to the next vision,” Dalinar said.\nAnd so you continue, bullheaded as always, the Stormfather snapped. We\nclash, you refuse to listen, and you bend me to your will. You talk of\nreconciliation, and us getting along, but then you ignore my wishes when it\nis convenient for you. Then you are angry when I don’t want to work with\nyou?\nDalinar stopped beside the shimmer. “Would you let the world fall under\nOdium’s control because of your pride, Stormfather?”\nBetter than potentially letting it burn, Dalinar, under your control. I need\nsomeone willing to work with the power, not against it.\n“Sometimes there is no path forward,” Dalinar said, “so you have to\nbreak one open.”\nLike you did with Elhokar? Pounding him into submission? You never\nknew he was seeing Cryptics because instead of asking why he was afraid,\nyou burst in and attacked him!\n“I showed him I wasn’t a threat!” Dalinar said.\nBy beating him near senseless, the Stormfather said. I should never have\npicked you, Dalinar. You are born of war, and trail blood like a shadow. The\nsole thing you know how to do is break. If you are told no, you just punch\nharder—because life has taught you that’s how to get what you want. But\nsometimes, deny it though you may, the world doesn’t need what you want.\nDalinar let his fingers trail from the line of light. There was … there was\ntoo much truth in the Stormfather’s words.\n“What are you?” Dalinar asked, narrowing his eyes at the shimmer.\n“What are you really?”\nWhat I’ve always been, the Stormfather said. Perhaps if you hadn’t\ntreated me like you did Elhokar and every other person in your life, we’d\nhave made it further, Dalinar. I suppose the fault is mine. I knew what you\nwere. This is the end. You will die in this realm—a worse death than your\nbrother, and a worse one than you deserve. Goodbye.\nThe Stormfather faded, and the vision burst like a bubble, Stormlight\nswirling around him, consuming him. Those words echoed in his mind. A\nfarewell. An expectation of death.\nThe Stormfather was right. The only way Dalinar knew how to solve\nproblems was by attacking them. It was a flaw. Perhaps a fatal one.\nBut blood of his fathers, he was not going to die in here. He was not\ngoing to let the world wither beneath Odium because of his own\nweaknesses. He might know only how to kill and fight, but at least he was\nstorming good at it.\nHe again seized hold of the line of light Connecting them.

The Stormfather wasn’t simply an\nanchor, he was the pathway, the portal. The answer. Dalinar held to the line\nof light with one hand, and seized the one Connecting him to Navani with\nthe other. He heaved on both, pulling like he had on that fateful day when\nhe’d bound the realms.\nFor a long moment—during which he knew time was passing with\nfrightening speed—he stood there, a line of light in each hand, like some\nmythical giant. The one the Thaylen stories said pulled the sun up by a cord\neach morning. He shouted, straining, and through sheer force of will\nbrought his hands together and made the lines meet.\nRealities overlapped. He heard the Stormfather growl in anger—for in\nthat moment, a new vision formed. A familiar sight: the large main\nthoroughfare of Urithiru, full of people dressed in old styles of clothing.\nTakamas, robes, long enveloping skirts. A man strode among them, tall and\nconfident, wearing Shardplate that glowed blue—matched by his rippling\nblue cape. A Windrunner. His helm was off, revealing blond hair and skin\npale as the palest Shin.\nDalinar knew that man.\nWe’re here, he thought. It worked. He checked his arm, and found he’d\nlost another day. Three remained until the contest, but he was here. At the\nright time. He glanced to the side, where Navani had replaced one of the\nmany people waiting in the wings of the hallway. Gav held to her leg.\n“What is this?” she asked. “Dalinar, what did you do?”\n“I used my Connection to the Stormfather to bring us here,” he said. “To\nwhere we need to be.”\n“How do you know?”\n“You see that Radiant?” Dalinar said, pointing. “He’s the first one who\ngave up his Blade and Plate at the Recreance, the leader who stepped out\nbefore them all. I remember him distinctly from my visions of that day. He\nstill has his armor now, and he looks younger than I remember, so the\nRecreance hasn’t happened yet.” He paused. “We’ve reached our goal:\nthese are the last days before Honor died.”\nTHE END OF\nDay Six\nDyel had the most unusual of visitors.\nThat was not uncommon in Iri, now that the Owners had returned. They\nwalked the streets, with bodies bearing patterns that looked like they were\npainted. Red, white, and black.\nBut these visitors were not of the Owners. These visitors were different.\nThe three sat at a table in her shop near the cubbies on the wall where\nher grandfather—before his murder—had put shoes. When they’d come in,\nthey’d pretended they were from “the East.” But Dyel knew accents, and\nthese men were not from the East. Besides, their clothing was strange—\nparticularly the tallest man’s, with the long white coat and the spectacles\npeeking from his pocket.\nShe hovered in the doorway to the kitchen after delivering their tea,\nhoping her mother wouldn’t notice her loitering."

She could almost believe he was from the far East, where terrible\nmen were said to be the fiercest of warriors. But he liked sugar in his tea.\nWhat kind of fierce warrior liked sugar in his tea?\n“Of course I’m not,” said the tubby one, who was constantly scowling.\n“The device is unpredictable, don’t you know?” This one had darker skin\ntoo, and was completely bald. Older. Shorter. Again he wore odd clothing—\nmost people in Iri went around without shirts, and only a bandeau for the\nwomen. He wore a cloak and colorful robes. In this weather?\nThe tall man grunted, then sipped his sugared tea. The third of them sat\nquietly. A Shin man of middling height, also balding—with a scar on his\nhead—light skin, and more normal clothing, for an outlander. Shirt and\ntrousers. He didn’t talk as much. But he watched. She knew people like\nthat.\nLest they think that she was observing them, Dyel busied herself\ncleaning tables, then standing by the door to give welcoming smiles to those\nwho passed on the street. She liked that: watching the different kinds of\npeople who were part of the One. She also liked smelling the ocean air.\nThough they were too poor to have a shop in the best part of town, the\nbreeze carried the crisp, salty air inland. A gift of experience she could add\nto the One.\nOutside, an Owner walked past, a hulking figure with carapace and eyes\nthat glowed red. There was some discussion about them in Iri; were these\nsingers, these Owners, part of the One, or were they something else? She\nthought they must be the One. It wouldn’t be the One unless it—God—\nencompassed everything. Every person a piece of it, extended out into the\ncosmere to live a different life and bring back enriching knowledge.\nHer mother didn’t believe, but Dyel did. Because if she did, then\nGrandpa Ym was always with her and she with him.\n“Serving girl?” one of the men called. “Could I get another?”\nShe hurried to the table with the three strangers, her hair aflutter. She\ntrimmed it only when Mother forced her to. She was Iriali, and her golden\nhair was her heritage. She quickly refilled the men’s cups as the thoughtful\none—the quiet one—set a sphere on the table.\nHer breath caught. A full broam? She looked to the man, who had a\nround, friendly face. He nodded.\nShe snatched it up, the azure light inside it making her skin glow. But\nMother would insist she ask. So, reluctantly, she spoke. “Do I have to give\nyou change?”\n“No,” he said, smiling. “Though I wouldn’t mind answers to a question\nor two.”\nShe shrugged. “Sure.”"

She nearly dropped the teapot.\nShe’d suspected they weren’t what they said, but this? This?\n“I’m sorry I have to go I forgot my mother wanted me to check on the\nbiscuits stay as long as you want thank you for the tip we are closed now\ngoodbye.” She scampered into the rear room—now a kitchen and living\nspace, transformed from her grandfather’s workshop. She put her back to\nthe wall, her heart thundering.\nHe had returned. The murderer. What to do?\nFind Mother.\nMother was gone. Dyel found nothing but a note. Back in fifteen. Watch\nthe shop.\nOh no. Nonononono.\nShe scrambled past globby purple fearspren and found a knife for\nspreading butter. Then she hid in the corner, clutching it, trying not to be too\nloud as she cried and trembled. Until they darkened the doorway. Three\nmen—two shorter, one taller. Dyel yelped despite herself, holding out the\nknife.\nThe tall one glanced at the thoughtful one. “Look what you’ve done,\nDemoux,” he said. “I told you to stop talking about that.”\n“I need an intelligent spren to study!” he said. “They keep telling me\nno.”\n“Perhaps because you keep saying you want to ‘study’ them, isn’t that\nso?” the grumpy one said. “We certainly frightened fewer people when your\ntranslator didn’t work.”\nThe tallest man knelt before Dyel, who tried to squeeze herself against\nthe wall, her skirt getting twisted and crumpled, the rough grain of the wood\npressing into the skin of her back except where she wore her bandeau.\n“I’m sorry,” the man said, “to have—”\nThe rear door slammed open and there was her mother—frantic, in loose\nblue trousers and matching bandeau, with a golden mane of hair that was\nradiant in the light of the setting sun. She saw the three strangers.\nHer Shardblade materialized a second later.\nBright and silver, their family’s hidden secret, kept quiet since it had\nmanifested a few months ago. But few secrets mattered when you found\nyour twelve-year-old daughter facing three assailants.\n“Whoa,” the tall one said, leaping away. He was the one, the killer.\n“Whoa.” He pulled something from his belt, something he brandished like a\nweapon, though Dyel had never seen a weapon that was just a metal tube\nwith a handle.\nThe grumpy one smashed a sphere into the ground, somehow cracking it.\nStormlight flowed up around him, and strange symbols formed in the air.\nMother leaped in front of Dyel, sweating, gripping her weapon in two\nhands. “We knew you’d be back! We knew you’d come for me once you\nheard!”\nDyel crawled forward and grabbed her around the legs, terrified.\nThey all stood silently in the room until the thoughtful Shin man spoke.\n“What the hell is going on?”"

I\ntalked to the families of others you killed. We know what you are.\nMurderer.”\nDyel cowered. Mother kept trying to inch them toward the door.\nStrangely, the tall man relaxed, lowering his weapon.\nThe bald one lowered his hands, the strange glowing light around him\nevaporating. “I told you that you looked like him.”\n“I do not,” the tall one said.\n“You kind of do,” the thoughtful one said.\n“Just because we’re both dark-skinned?” the tall one said.\n“I’m dark-skinned too,” said the bald one. “And nobody says I look like\nhim.”\n“You’re silver most of the time, Galladon,” the tall one said, putting his\nweapon away in his coat. “Listen, I’m not the murderer you’re worried\nabout. That’s Nale, the Herald.”\nThey both watched him, terrified, silent—until Mother, oddly, cocked\nher head. She dismissed her Blade, which made Dyel quiver. Surely Mother\ndidn’t believe a killer.\nUma appeared a second later, sliding up the wall, a collection of lights\nlike those scattered by a prism. “It is all right, Dyel,” she said. Her voice\nwas quiet, like the sound of a vibrating glass cup. “I know the Herald Nale\nby sight—the one who killed your grandfather—and this is not him.”\nOh. Dyel carefully stood up behind her mother. Her heart pounding,\nlikely the same as all of them. Until a moment later, the thoughtful one said,\n“Can I study you?”\n“Um …” Uma said. “No?”\n“I told you to stop phrasing it that way, Demoux,” said the one who had\nbeen called Galladon.\n“I don’t want to lie to them,” Demoux said, gesturing.\nThe tall one cleared his throat. “Perhaps we should go.”\nMother eyed them, still tense. She’d still heard her daughter cry out, then\nhad found three strange men intimidating her in the rear of the shop.\n“Mother,” Dyel whispered, pointing. “They knew. They asked me about\nUma.”\n“How?” Mother demanded.\n“We didn’t mean to frighten the girl,” the tall one said, with a placating\nhand forward. “We had simply heard rumors. We are scholars, and like to\nstudy spren.”\n“See?” Demoux said. “Baon uses the word.”\n“Baon is not an example of how to be in any way tactful!” Galladon said.\n“Crazyfools, all of you.” What a curious word. He stepped forward, and\nthough he had been the grouchiest at the table ordering drinks, he made his\ntone polite now. “I’m sorry we frightened you. We will go now, with your\nleave, Radiant.”\nMother glanced down at Dyel, then sighed, looking back at the men. “I\nhave a letter for you.”\nWhat?\nWhat?\n“Mother?” Dyel asked."

It’s in my nightstand. Please fetch it.”\nDyel, confused, did as she was asked. Mother remained, eye-to-eye with\nthe three strangers. That woman? The one who wore many rings, and who\nhad helped for several weeks at the local charity hospital. A healer skilled\nwith herbs, whose room had smelled of the fish she’d caught in the\nPurelake, then dried. She’d come for tea each morning.\nIn the nightstand beside the bed, Dyel found a sealed envelope. On it\nwas drawn, roughly, the profiles of three men. These three men, except with\nquite comical, exaggerated proportions. What an odd experience from the\nOne. How had the woman known? But then, Dyel’s life had been turned\nupside down ever since Uma had arrived and her mother had started\nglowing sometimes. Unique experiences.\nShe cherished thinking of it that way. So many didn’t believe these days,\nbut she did. For Grandfather.\nShe scampered down the stairs and handed the letter to her mother, who\ntossed it to the men. “I was told,” Mother explained, “that I would know\nwho to give this to.”\nThe tall one, Baon, caught it. He eyed the others, then slit it open with a\npocketknife.\n“It’s from him,” Baon said.\n“Of course it is,” Demoux replied. “Right as we’re leaving.”\n“What does it say?” Galladon said.\nBaon closed the envelope. “It has only his signature. And a crude\ndepiction of male genitalia.”\n“From the Trickster Aspect,” Mother said. “He was here too, last year.”\n“Of course he was,” Demoux repeated, then sighed. “I’m ready to get off\nthis rusting planet. What about you two?”\n“Yes, please,” Galladon said. “One of the eldest beings in the cosmere\n… and he has the mental age of a thirteen-year-old.”\n“If this man ever returns,” Baon said, “keep your distance. He isn’t\nterribly dangerous, but whenever he’s spotted, innocents get hurt.”\nThat was only natural. He was the Trickster Aspect, spun out of the One\nto create chaos. They had hundreds of legends about him, but you couldn’t\ninsult him by not serving him tea.\nA ding came from Galladon’s pocket.\n“Time,” he said.\nThe three men started out. Baon hesitated by the door. “Things might be\nchaotic in your city for a little while.”\nThen he too left.\nDyel hugged her mother, but the fearspren remained. Not just because of\nwhat Baon had said. This meant the killer had not yet come, and they still\nneeded to fear him.\nOutside, people started shouting.\n“I will look,” Uma said in her tinkling voice. “Stay strong. I do not know\nwhat this is.”\nMother nodded and led Dyel up the steps as Uma went out the door.\nTheir shop was part of a larger building, four stories high, and they helped"

        "text": "what this is.”\nMother nodded and led Dyel up the steps as Uma went out the door.\nTheir shop was part of a larger building, four stories high, and they helped\nkeep it tidy and fixed things—which meant Mother could take them up the\naccess stairway to the roof.\nThere, they saw what was causing the chaos. Cusicesh the Protector had\nrisen from the bay—the great, multi-armed spren made of a column of\nwater. That was all? Dyel relaxed. She’d seen Cusicesh many times. But\nwhy then were so many people pointing and crying out? Why were so many\nrunning?\n“It’s … the wrong time,” her mother said.\nCusicesh—breaking all tradition—waved his hands out to the sides,\npalms toward the city. And then, before him in the bay, the air split in a\nglorious radiant fountain. A column of light.\n“The gateway to the land of shadows,” Mother whispered. “Honor’s\ngateway … Oh Father, Mother, ancestors who have become One … Dyel,\nfetch the travel packs! It’s time!”\nDyel froze. Time … the travel packs … All good Iriali kept them, but\nthat was mostly a formality, unless …\nIt was time? A rare awespren burst around her, made of blue rings of\nsmoke.\n“People,” Cusicesh said. He never spoke. His voice was deep, and\nvibrated the city—somehow loud enough to make her soul shake, but not so\nloud it hurt her ears. “I am to be your guide for the Fifth Journey.”\nTime. That meant …\nTime to continue the Long Trail.\nTime to find the Fifth Land.\nShocked out of her reverie, she went running for the travel packs—\nterrified that this great day should have come during her life. She wished\nthere were a way to explain that she was filled up with new experiences.\nThat she’d rather live some peaceful days, without Owners returning to the\nland, or her mother starting to glow, or the call to the Long Trail itself\noccurring.\nIt wasn’t to be. As when she met back with her mother, Uma had\nreturned. Mother was crying.\n“We will try,” Mother whispered to the spren, who brightened the floor\nof the rooftop. “We will see … see how far you can go. Come, Dyel. We\nmustn’t miss the call. Boats are already rowing out to meet the gateway.”\nAnd so, with only their travel packs, they found their way to a boat.\nThey joined with the light of the gateway, which she briefly thought must\nbe like rejoining the One when she died. They emerged into the place of\nshadows with the leaders of their kind, who had already begun preparing\ncaravans to cross the darkness. Other portals, she heard, had opened all\nacross Iri—one in every major city.\nNearby, she spied the three strangers again, Demoux complaining about\nthe “odd behavior for a perpendicularity of this nature.” Mother settled her\ndown in some blankets, then went to find them a position in the caravans.\nDyel clutched her pack to her chest, stunned by how fast it had happened.\nHer time in the city, with the shop, was over.\nShe whispered a quiet farewell.\nIt was time to leave Roshar. Forever."

Forever.\nOdium worked on teaching Dalinar his lessons until something pulled him\naway. Something surprising, alarming.\nCultivation was moving against him.\nOdium was shocked, for he had genuinely not thought her capable. Her\nmovements made him turn from the Spiritual Realm and focus his attention\non Kharbranth, his quiet seaside city, protected from storm and war.\nThere, Cultivation’s agents were in motion. People with faintly blue\nveins beneath the skin, wearing black, their faces covered. They carried\nmodern equipment: crossbows, half-shard shields, blades of the finest steel,\nand armor of some strange Soulcast material. Which was hard enough to\nstop an arrow, yet lightweight, and left them limber.\nHer forces sliced through Kharbranth, having arrived in sleek black\nboats in the night.\nHe was … impressed. This was incredible. A tactical, precision strike on\nhis home and family? He formed an invisible avatar, standing in the sky, the\nwind playing at his robes. He watched with mounting concern as his city\nguard fell to grisly deaths, each of them choking on their own blood as\nfighters with no uniforms cut through the city. His defenders didn’t have a\nchance, and Taravangian could do nothing. The Fused and Unmade were\nboth forbidden this city, so none were close enough to help.\nIn minutes, Cultivation’s forces were assaulting the palace at the top of\nthe city, cut into the stone cliff face. Odium trembled, feeling—for the first\ntime since his Ascension—panic. Like all emotions, it welled inside him\nmore strongly than any mortal could feel, making him tremble and gasp.\nCultivation appeared next to him. “I will not hurt them unless you refuse\nto back down.”\n“You …” Odium said, his anger stoking. “You monster.”\n“I do what must be done.”\nHe laughed, tears of pain forming at his eyes—because he’d created this\navatar to simulate mortal responses. The tempests within his power, the\nchanges to his rhythms, were far, far more terrible signs—but even still,\ntears were familiar to him.\nSo many emotions. He wrestled with them, his mortal training and his\ndivine mind struggling together. Betrayal, fear, and … and satisfaction.\n“You use my methods, Cultivation,” he whispered. “You know the true\nway of kings.”\nHer avatar would not meet his eyes. Her forces broke into the palace,\nand several members of his staff … were plants of hers. They gave up his\ndaughter and his grandchildren, who were soon imprisoned in their own\nrooms. With murderers poised to strike.\n“You would actually do it,” Taravangian said. “You did have another\nplan! You didn’t simply pick me because you suspected I could hold\nOdium’s power. You picked me because you thought you could control\nme!”\n“I don’t think it, Taravangian,” she said. “I know there is only one thing\nin all this world you’ve ever legitimately cared for. Now I hold it. Back\ndown. Go to the human coalition and agree to an immediate armistice. Give\nthe Kholins their kingdom and be content with the lands you already hold."

Give\nthe Kholins their kingdom and be content with the lands you already hold.\nThey are more than your share anyway. Make peace.”\n“And what growth can come from peace?” he asked, quivering with the\nweight of so many emotions. “Admit it, Cultivation. You let the war\nproceed for millennia and did not intercede, because conflict doesn’t just\ninflame emotion, it forces growth. Your power’s Intent.”\nHer avatar stared at him boldly, but he felt the tremble in her power. Yes.\nIt did like war, didn’t it? She hated suffering, but she was the Vessel. Her\npower loved anything that encouraged people to learn, better themselves,\nand achieve. That was often accelerated by conflict.\n“You force me to make peace now,” he said, “not because you want to\nend the hostilities—but because you don’t want to be wrong in having\nchosen me to Ascend.”\n“You do not know my heart.”\n“And you,” he whispered, “do not know what you have created,\nKoravellium Avast. I no longer question. I know my path is right, and so—\nat each point—the next step is clearly manifest. No longer is my challenge\nabout decisions, but merely about having the strength to execute them.”\nIn the ocean several miles from Kharbranth, a wave began to build.\n“Taravangian,” Cultivation said. “What … what is this?”\n“A … lesson,” he whispered, a profound sadness welling within him as\nthe wave grew. Larger and larger.\nCultivation gasped, horror vibrating from her. “Taravangian. No. You\ncan’t.”\n“I will weep,” he whispered. “Know that I will weep.”\nHis avatar closed its eyes, tears leaking down its cheeks. He thought of\nhis family—not only his daughter, dear Savrahalidem, but his\ngrandchildren. Gvori, Karavangia, and little Ruli—whom he’d been forced\nto use in schemes before. And of course there were his dear friends of the\nDiagram. Faithful Maben, who sat with her own granddaughter in the\nmorning light, knitting, completely unaware of the incursion force. Mrall,\nalready dead, having tried to protect Taravangian’s family. Adrotagia … she\nwas walking the palace gardens, and assassins crept up behind her.\n“I will remember you,” he whispered as the wave surged toward the city,\nnow a hundred feet tall. It was an action he could not have taken anywhere\nelse, for it was too direct an intervention. But Kharbranth … he, as a mortal,\nhad been promised Kharbranth. That still held.\n“Taravangian!” Cultivation said. “I will back down. S !”\nTAY YOUR HAND\n“Ah,” he said, “but the lesson is not just for you; it is for any who would\nthink to intimidate me. A god must have no holes in his armor, Cultivation.”\nHe steeled himself, observing her panic and pain for her followers who\nwould be consumed. She could not watch. She turned away, which gave\nhim peace, and let him summon his power.\nThen Odium, God of Passions, destroyed Kharbranth entirely—the one"

She turned away, which gave\nhim peace, and let him summon his power.\nThen Odium, God of Passions, destroyed Kharbranth entirely—the one\ncity he’d bargained all his mortal life to protect.\nI’m sorry.\nLosing a squire wore on Sigzil, but he threw himself into the next phase of\nhis plan. The trick was going to be to divert the enemy to Narak Three—\nsouthwest of the Oathgate platform—instead of the Oathgate itself. A\ndifficult proposition, as the enemy was shrewd.\n“They’ll obviously want to take Narak Two next,” General Winn\nexplained, pointing to their maps. “Holding the Oathgate is of utmost\nstrategic importance.” The others nodded.\nWas it though? In a traditional battle, yes, it would be. It would cut off\nthe human retreat, make them desperate. Isolate them. Yet … Sigzil\nconsidered as he stood by the table with the others, men more experienced\nthan he. Should he say what he was thinking? Surely it wasn’t wise to\ncontradict them.\nBut why was he here, if not to lead?\n“Is it though?” he asked them. “They have only three days now to\ncapture Narak Prime. Will they waste time on Narak Two?”\n“It’s our retreat,” General Balivar said. He was younger, like Sigzil.\n“Seems a wise way to break us.”\n“Or galvanize us to fight to the last man,” Sigzil said, gesturing. “Which\nisn’t what they want. They want to break us, make us retreat. If they take the\nOathgate, we can’t do that, and they are more likely to lose than win—\nbecause of the deadline. They can’t afford to make us hunker down.”\nThe others stared at the maps. “Storms,” Winn said. “I think he’s right.\nOur plans are stale as last week’s bread. We need to be looking at the\nsituation as it stands now.”\n“If they throw everything they have at Narak Prime,” Sigzil said, “they\nmight overwhelm us. But here’s the key: they may not know how low we\nare on Stormlight, and Narak Prime has the tallest walls and the strongest\ndefenses.\n“They have to be worrying about the looming deadline. So what we need\nto do is make them think that by attacking Narak Three, they’ll be getting\nwhat they want: a way to demoralize us. We have to make it too tempting a\nstrike to pass up.”\n“A feint,” Ka said, with a nod, holding her silvery Shardpen at the\nwriting station. “Like how you pretend weakness in a sword fight, and\nmake the enemy strike there.”\n“Pull back troops to Narak Prime and Narak Two,” Sigzil said, rubbing\nhis chin. “Then … we still have those Lightweavers?”\n“Yes, sir,” Winn said.\n“Send for Stargyle.”\nWithin minutes, the handsome Lightweaver was ushered in, his hair\nimmaculate as usual. Maybe he kept it that way through rain and storm with\nan illusion. Sigzil sat him down with the generals.\n“We have been using Narak Three as a supply depot,” he explained."

Sigzil sat him down with the generals.\n“We have been using Narak Three as a supply depot,” he explained.\n“And those Deepest Ones have always been prowling around, watching. In\nthis largest building, I want you to make an illusion of gemstones—our\nstorage for it. Then we, in the fighting, need to find a way to let the enemy\nget a glimpse inside—so they assume taking Narak Three would be a huge\nblow to us. See if we can trick them into throwing everything they have at\nit.”\nIt took a little while to get a plan in place, but Stargyle was confident—\nhe seemed to like the idea of having something relevant to do on the\nbattlefield other than using illusions to hide groups of archers or medical\nstaff, to move them into position covertly. As he left, Sigzil shared a look\nwith his command staff, and left the most worrying part unsaid.\nThey were laying a trap to feign losing their Stormlight cache … but in\nreality, it was a partial truth. They were dangerously low on Stormlight. And\nif the Bondsmiths didn’t return soon …\nHe emerged from the meeting into a camp doing its preparations\nbetween battles. Swords being sharpened, soldiers catching sleep while they\ncould. He walked across the courtyard, receiving salutes, answering a few\nquestions—bolstering each person he talked to, which he now did by habit.\nThat done, he forced himself to climb a ladder—not fly up it—to the\nwooden wall walk, constructed alongside the hulking stone fortification the\nStonewards had built.\n“How long do you suppose we can last,” he whispered, “before we run\nout?”\n“Hard to say,” Vienta whispered back. “There are a lot of variables. But\neach shipment of Light from Urithiru is smaller than the one before, and\neach fight takes more than the previous, as the enemy pushes harder and\nharder.”\n“Three days?” he asked, reaching the top of the wall. “Can we last three\ndays?”\n“I … do not think it likely,” she admitted.\nUp here he found Leyten leaning against the wall. Sigzil fell in beside\nhis friend, enjoying a rare moment of peace, gazing out over the darkened\nPlains—which were occasionally lit red by bursts of lightning. It was …\npretty, actually, if he removed the context.\n“Is it strange?” Leyten said. “That I miss them? The chasms? Not merely\nmaking armor down there, as I mentioned before. I like the feel of those\nchasms. Teeming with life, never fully quiet, but with a quietude. Like\ntoday, in fact. With that gentle lightning and a plain pretending to sleep.”\n“I feel it too,” Sigzil said. “Hard to believe at times like this, how much\nblood and death this quiet place has caused.”\n“I wasn’t supposed to be a bridgeman,” Leyten said. “Most of you were\nforced into the army; I came willingly, as a way to send money home to my\nfamily.

Shipped off to die running bridges to\nsoothe the ego of a highborn soldier.\n“He died, you know,” Leyten said, with a half smirk. “Two bridge runs\nlater. Gabaron, the man who consigned me to the bridge crews? Dead.” He\neyed Sigzil. “Bad riveting to his armor straps. Whole cuirass snapped off.\nTurns out if you keep killing the guys who maintain your equipment, you\nstop having well-maintained equipment.”\n“Once in a while,” Sigzil said, smiling, “fate hits us with something\nthat’s downright poetic, doesn’t it?”\n“Yeah …” Leyten trailed off. “Sig … do I belong here?”\nSigzil frowned, regarding his friend, with his curly hair wet from the\ndrizzle. Leyten looked down. “I’m not a true Radiant, Sig. I’m a guy who\nlikes to sit and count how many uniforms we need before we run out. I\ndon’t belong in the sky, glowing. I’ve never felt comfortable with people\npaying attention to me. And during this fighting, I’ve lost two squires. I just\n… I wonder …”\nStorms, what to say to that? Sigzil considered, and took his friend by the\nshoulder, drew his eyes. Then he smiled and said, “I know. I feel it too.”\nLeyten smiled back. “You do? You’ve been so confident lately.”\n“An act,” Sigzil said.\n“But … Sig, what if I’m not good enough? Those squires … they’re my\nfault. Their deaths. I …”\n“Blame Kaladin.”\nLeyten frowned, glancing at him.\n“Kal put us in charge,” Sigzil said, trying a calculated gambit. “He could\nhave been here. He isn’t. So it’s his fault.”\n“He led us well!” Leyten snapped, pulling out of his funk, eyes alight\nwith determination. “He did everything he could, then more. He’s not to\nblame.”\n“Oh, so you trust his decisions?”\n“I …” Leyten trailed off, and smiled sheepishly. “I suppose I do.”\n“Then you have to trust that he was correct to leave us in charge,\nLeyten,” Sigzil said. “If you blame yourself for your squires dying, then\nyou’ll have to blame Kal for when Maps died, or Teft, or any other losses.\nCan’t have it both ways.” He leaned closer. “And we both know Kaladin is\na storming hero. So …”\nLeyten stood taller. “Yeah. Yeah, you’re right.” He looked to Sigzil.\n“Thank you. Sig … I miss him, Kaladin. But you should know, I’m just as\nproud to serve under you.”\nSigzil gave the man’s arm a squeeze, then sent him to get the\nWindrunners ready for the next clash. Oddly, the things he’d said to Leyten\nresonated with him too. Inside, he still wondered … but those voices were\ngrowing quieter. As the camp rushed to execute his plans, and his generals"

As the camp rushed to execute his plans, and his generals\nfound his ideas worthwhile, Sigzil discovered something remarkable.\nThis was him. This man who could lead. He finally had a place to\nchannel all of his thoughts and ideas. He had reasons to make those ideas as\nprecise and calculated as possible. His love of engineering and physics\nactually came into play in this defense, and his interactions with the others\nbolstered him.\nHe wasn’t so lofty that he thought he deserved command. But somehow,\nin being forced into it, he’d discovered something important. Here, beneath\nred lightning and on a plain full of chasms he’d claimed as his own, Sigzil\nfound himself. In a way that training with Master Hoid, or learning beneath\nKaladin, had never done for him.\nSigzil was, at long last, the man he’d always wanted to be.\nHiking through the chasms reawakened Venli’s childhood, and she loved it.\nEven with the red lightning above and the terrible way thunder echoed\ndown here. Even with the otherwise absolute darkness broken only by their\nfrail gemstones. Even with a flow of water that came up to her knees at\ntimes. Even with the stench of death and the ancient corpses they\nsometimes passed.\nEven with all that, she found she loved this place.\nLoved that life had conquered such depths, as marked by the bobbing\ngreen glow of circular lifespren with their delicate spines. They’d weave\nthrough the holes in skulls or past chunks of cracked carapace, then dance\nwith patches of rotspren, like punch lines to one another’s jokes, red and\ngreen. Each meaningless without the other.\nShe loved the sounds of trickling water, of vines constricting, of\ncremlings on the walls—and the steady, dangerous splashing of the\nchasmfiends behind. She would periodically glance back and see them there\n—wedged between the walls, using their many legs to maneuver, their faces\nlike chunks of broken rock. She’d panic briefly, then attune Awe. These\nwere their allies now.\nShe closed her eyes, listening to that strange tone she followed, growing\nmore firm and pure as they traveled inward. She breathed in the potent air,\nwalked through the darkness with her hands out to the sides.\nAnd immediately tripped, her foot snagging on a vine beneath the\nflowing water. She caught herself before she fell, and attuned\nEmbarrassment. Maybe best to keep her eyes open.\nThe water flow, although shallow, was growing treacherous. The chasms\nhad a mostly flat floor, the result of crem settlement competing against\nerosion and creating a kind of equilibrium that prevented the chasms from\nfilling in. She thought the erosion would eventually win, especially after\nseeing it had already done so on the far eastern side of the Shattered Plains,\nbut that was probably eons away.\n“I don’t like walking through this water,” Bila said from nearby,\nsplashing as she stepped. “My brain keeps attuning the Terrors, telling me\nthis is the trickle at the start of a highstorm.”\n“The Everstorm rains far less than the highstorm,” Venli said. “We\nshould be fine.”"

        "text": "this is the trickle at the start of a highstorm.”\n“The Everstorm rains far less than the highstorm,” Venli said. “We\nshould be fine.”\nBila raised a gemstone to light her face and stared up through the\nopening in the chasm toward the angry sky. “At least we shouldn’t have to\nsuffer through a meeting of Everstorm and highstorm again.”\nVenli had heard their tales of escaping into the night through the chasms\nwhen that horrific first meeting of storms had occurred. She’d been on the\nplateaus then, though it felt like a lifetime ago—and remembered through\nthe eyes of another person.\nTimbre thrummed. A theory: the meeting of storm and storm had never\nagain been so violent as it had been that first time, when plateaus had been\ndestroyed. Was that another clue? Had this location caused the violence of\nthat convergence? Were others weaker because they happened elsewhere?\nOr was it what they’d guessed originally: that the violence of that first\nconvergence had been caused by the Everstorm’s exultant inception?\nShe had no answers, so she led on until they hit an obstruction in the\nchasm: a damlike natural structure, created by a log wedged between the\nwalls. A waterfall poured over it, and potential handholds of wood and bone\nwere covered in moss. Her skin crawled, and she attuned the Terrors at the\nmere thought of climbing it. Of being required to touch the bodies of the\ndead.\nThe others hesitated around and behind her, but then a shadow—\nblocking the violent red light crackling in the sky above—fell across her.\nThundercloud leaned down and studied the obstruction. Then the long\nmandibles beside its mouth—which were jointed, and roughly the thickness\nof a singer’s arms—reached to Venli. Her rhythm froze as the chasmfiend\npicked her up with those armlike appendages and held her beneath his chin.\nHe crawled over the obstruction.\nThe other chasmfiends followed, carrying singers, and making several\ntrips—easily cresting the dam by moving, as they often did in here, with\ntheir legs pressed against either side of the chasm. Their forelegs were\nstrong and powerful, but not hinged in a way to grab or lift. These smaller\nones below the head, though, had fine articulation.\nVenli let her rhythm start again as she breathed deeply, now standing in\nwaist-high water upstream from the dam—for it had formed something of a\nlake. The next person set down by the chasmfiends was Leshwi. Venli\nquietly attuned Tension; she and the Fused hadn’t interacted much in the\nlast few days—both were uncertain about their new relationship.\nLeshwi eyed her, then hummed to Agony. “I do not know if I can\ncontinue this way, Venli. I was a demigod for millennia. Now … I stand in\nwet clothing, shivering.”\n“Would you go back to him?” Venli asked. “Become his again, fight in a\nwar that you don’t believe in? Kill, so you can be comfortable again?”\nLeshwi’s rhythm changed to Reprimand and she glanced at Venli in\nanger. Then, with obvious effort, she attuned Withdrawal instead, looking\naway.\n“You were strong enough,” Venli said to Praise, “to turn against your"

Now …” She glanced down at her wet clothes, her\nhands outspread. “Now … why am I even here? What am I doing? I can’t\nhelp you.”\n“But you can,” Venli said. “If we encounter a patrol from Odium’s army,\nthere’s a chance they won’t know you’ve switched sides. They’ll obey a\nFused of your renown. You’re our last defense against discovery.”\nLeshwi paused at that, humming to Consideration.\n“We’ll find a new place for you,” Venli promised. “With the listeners.\nYou might not be a god among us—we will have no gods—but you’ll be\nsomething better. Free.”\n“Free …” Leshwi said. “It has been a long, long time …” She glanced\nupward. “But can I ever be free if I cannot soar?”\nSoon, the chasmfiends had carried each of the listeners across the\nobstruction. Venli’s gemstone lit Thundercloud’s dark eyes as he leaned\ndown beside her. His entire face was made of plates, the eye peeking\nthrough a junction between a few. She could feel Curiosity pulsing from\nhim.\n“You want to know the source of the song as much as we do,” Venli said.\nHe looked inward toward the center, still many hours’ march away. Then\nhe cocked his head, his long mandibles twitching. She followed his gaze,\nand crackling lightning illuminated something in the chasm. Another\nobstruction wedged between the walls, but higher up. Not creating a dam\nthis time.\n“Shall we see?” she asked.\nIn response, Thundercloud picked her up again—chill water streaming\nfrom her—and lifted her high to inspect …\nA bridge.\nOne of those the humans used. Old, scarred, grown over with haspers\nand shalebark, wedged here twenty feet up. Moss covered the bottom side,\nand rockbuds had begun finding purchase on it. Venli could see nicks in the\nwood where arrows—launched by her kind—had stuck during an assault.\nA different kind of corpse. Held up under her arms, Venli reached out\nand touched the wood, projecting in her mind to the chasmfiend what this\nwould have looked like when new. They thought the beasts liked that kind\nof explanation.\nEventually Thundercloud set her down, and together they continued on,\ninward toward that sound. A discordant tone and chaotic rhythm becoming\nmore clear the closer they approached.\nJasnah sat, tense, with Queen Fen and their scribes as the spanreed wrote.\nWe got in close, Your Majesty, explained the Windrunner scribe on the\nother end. We waited for early morning when the enemy aerial force seemed\nleast alert, then came in under the waves. While the Fused know of this\ntrick, and post sentries to make sure we don’t sink their boats from below,\nwe were able to draw close without being spotted."

Your theory is\ncorrect: the holds of every ship our spren surveyed are filled with chunks of\nstone, not soldiers. Those on deck are decoys intended to give the\nimpression that the ships are so crowded, there is no room below. I highly\nsuspect those on top are not trained soldiers, but laborers who have been\ngiven warform, judging by how they act—but of course I cannot be sure.\nRegardless, I am convinced there is no invading army. Only an elaborate\nprop. We have reached a small island for stability to send this. We don’t\nthink the enemy spotted our efforts; a Lightweaver on hand was useful,\nthough I don’t think Red enjoyed the swimming portion all that much.\nAwaiting instructions.\nFen breathed out as Jasnah passed the page to be copied by their scribes,\nthen translated for the Thaylens and read out to the male generals. While\nthat was happening, Jasnah ordered the Windrunners to hold position for\nnow, in case they were needed for further reconnaissance.\nThey’d set up in a small room next to the larger planning chamber,\nwhich had—for two days—been full of the greatest living military minds\ndiscussing every avenue of defense. Against an assault that was not coming.\n“This is bad, Jasnah,” Fen said softly.\n“Bad?” Jasnah replied. “Fen, your city is almost certainly safe. Odium\nsaw that it was unassailable in the time before the deadline, so he’s focusing\non the two other battlefields.”\n“Do you really think he’ll just give us up?”\n“Well, the being known as Odium—even with a new host—is intelligent\nbeyond mortal measure.”\n“That’s hardly reassuring,” Fen said.\n“Fen,” Jasnah said, “the fact that he’s brilliant is a good thing for you. A\nsmart general knows how to win battles, but a brilliant one knows when to\nwalk away from them. Odium has seen that wasting resources here isn’t a\nviable strategy, and made a feint to divert resources from the Shattered\nPlains and Azimir, where he can win. You should be safe.”\n“Should be,” Fen said. “Jasnah … how confident are you in a ‘should’?”\n“Theories with strong evidence are the soul of scientific discovery,”\nJasnah said.\n“And if we acted on this intel? What would our next steps be? To send\nour troops and Radiants to reinforce the Shattered Plains, correct?”\nJasnah nodded. Careful watch in Shadesmar had prevented further\nOathgate spren from being taken by Sja-anat—for now, and hopefully\nforever, the Oathgates at Thaylen City and the Shattered Plains continued to\nwork for them. Therefore, the troops here could quickly be repositioned\nthere. She wished the same could be said of Azimir.\n“What if that’s what he wants?” Fen continued. “What if the empty holds\nare the ruse, and we’re meant to discover them? What if there’s a different\nplan to take this city?”"

It was a fallacy: the idea that\nyou could never know anything because there was always something to\nlearn. If you started to think that your enemy had planned for every decision\nyou could make, then you’d let your fear of being wrong guide you instead\nof a reliance upon the facts you’d discovered.\n“It’s possible,” Jasnah said, taking Fen’s hand. “I won’t lie and say\notherwise. But the trick with the rocks in the holds is a clever one, and was\ndifficult for us to confirm. Fen, the Shattered Plains is enduring the full\nwrath of the Everstorm and every Fused the enemy can throw at it. While\nwe sit here waiting.”\n“You’re saying I should abandon my city,” Fen said. “Send away the\ntroops and leave Thaylen City exposed.”\n“I’m saying we need to act on the information we have, not the\ninformation we think we don’t have.”\nFen looked away, though she held to Jasnah’s hand. “So close. Three\ndays, and we will know peace. But what if by listening to you now, I throw\neverything away, Jasnah? We can’t leave Thaylen City undefended. I can’t.”\n“I have to send the Radiants to bolster those at the Shattered Plains,”\nJasnah said. “I have Dalinar’s authority to do so. We can’t reach Azimir\nwith that Oathgate down, but we can do this much.”\n“You could be killing me and my kind.”\n“My moral philosophy is to do the most good I can in any situation,”\nJasnah said.\nFen slipped her hand from Jasnah’s. “Will you give me time to talk with\nthe Thaylen Central Council and see what they think?”\n“Of course,” Jasnah said. “I want the Windrunners back here to report\nanyway—spanreeds can be stolen, so we need direct firsthand\nconfirmation.” The Windrunner sending the message had given the proper\ncode words at the start, but who knew what Odium could see?\nFen left the room, troubled. And Jasnah, if she let herself be empathetic\nfor a moment, understood. To send troops away during this most important\nthree-day window? It would be excruciating, whether or not you knew it\nwas right. The enemy likely understood that. It was a curious quirk of\nmedicine that a placebo often worked even if you knew you were being\ngiven a placebo. This situation showed why, with a kind of inverse\nexample. A feint could work even if you knew it was a feint, because it left\nyou worried about what else you might be missing.\nDo the most good, she thought to herself. When decisions grew difficult,\nshe relied on this guiding philosophy. With that in mind, she began drawing\nup the orders for her troops to reinforce the Shattered Plains.\nYou are right, and your letter to me was—characteristically—full\nof wisdom and excellent deductions.\nShallan awoke in her past. It was that day. White carpet. It … it …\nNo."

It … it …\nNo.\nThe vision shifted. She was a child. Hiding in a corner. Crying while her\nparents shouted at each other.\nHers wasn’t a unique story, she knew. She’d listened over the years, had\ncollected people in her sketchpads. For almost every family like Lopen’s,\nfull of love and happiness, there was one like hers. Where the happy times\nwere the frosting on a dessert, used to cover up the misshapen lump that\nhadn’t come out of the oven properly.\nThere had been joy. But so often it had seemed a fabrication carefully\nconstructed to let them pretend. It was hard to remember those good times\nas she hid there hearing the shouts. As an adult, she sometimes told herself\nthe lie that everything had been wonderful up until her mother’s death; but\nas with many lies in her life, she had let that one live too long. They offered\nprotection, yes, but they could also hurt.\nMother slammed a door, then footsteps approached. Shallan, feeling so\nshort in this body, peeked out from her room to watch her mother stalk past.\nA flash of red-and-gold hair. Muttering words. “I can’t be like this. I can’t.\nI’m not a soldier, I’m a homemaker. This is what I want. This is what I\nalways wanted. I can’t. I can’t. I can’t. I can’t. I can’t. I can’t.”\nShallan ducked away.\nSo, Veil said. How do we face this? Now that we remember?\nShould we go after her? Radiant asked.\nShallan steeled herself, and did not follow—but storms, it was another\nstep forward. She didn’t look away, didn’t dodge the question. That was her\nmother.\nI’m almost ready, she acknowledged to them. But we need to find a\nvision where I’m an adult.\nAgreed, Veil said. For now, accept the memories.\nIn a child’s body, Shallan dried her tears and went skulking through the\ncorridors of the manor house. Father hadn’t often devolved to physical\nabuse yet, but he shouted at the servants, itching for a fight. So she veered\naway from him and crept under the steps, where he never looked.\nHer brothers huddled in here. All but Helaran, the eldest, whom Kaladin\nwould someday kill. Jushu wiped his eyes. Wikim pretended he hadn’t been\nafraid. Balat was a mound in the darkness, not glancing toward them.\nShallan took a diamond chip from her pocket, then she began telling\nthem a story. The elder her was in this body, experiencing these things, but\nunlike the other visions, she simply let it happen. That was possible, she\nfelt, only because this was her past, and a piece of her remembered what to\ndo.\nShe lived the memory as if she were riding on the wind.\nBecause this wasn’t frosting.

The looks\nher brothers gave as she ignored her own pain and fear and told them a tale\nshe’d imagined, the tale of a little axehound who explored the world.\nSeeing grand cities, eventually being mistaken for a king and crowned. It\nwas silly and made little sense, which was part of the charm. Besides, when\nyou’re starving, bread is a feast.\nBalat turned away from the wall and smiled. Jushu began to help her\nmake up ideas. Wikim stopped pretending to be strong, and allowed himself\nto be a wide-eyed little boy loving the story. Together they spun a yarn that\npushed back the shadows and the darkness. Together, despite parents who\nseemed not to care, they became a family anyway.\nLater, after Father had time to cool down and Mother was acting like\nherself again, they slipped out. Each brother hugged her, and they agreed to\ngo about their chores without being asked. That night, while tidying her\nroom, Shallan found a strange spiral pattern on the wall. Drawn to her by\nher lies—but not just any lies. Like all Cryptics, Testament had come\nseeking the most wonderful lies. The contradictions that made humans able\nto function.\nStories. Specifically, the one she’d told herself: the performance that she\nwas happy and strong and not terrified.\nA lie that made it possible to shine when all the world was dark.\nRenarin remembered this day.\nHe was in the body of his younger self, sitting at a feast. The fires\nburned high in the hearths—a frightful, menacing light, full of dancing\nflamespren. Even with proper flues, the huge fires made the room smell of\nchar and smoke. That scent would linger on his clothing; he’d pick up a\njacket that looked clean, then would carry the ghost of the bonfire all day\nlong.\nAround this time, in his youth, the Kholins had started practicing to be\nmore refined. King Gavilar had become less a soldier and more a politician\n—and he’d moved the fires from open bonfires into hearths with iron\ngrates. Renarin noted who in the grand hall appeared to enjoy the fire, and\nwho kept their distance. The distinction fascinated him.\nHe sat at the children’s table, where boys and girls still sat together,\nthough he was the tallest one there. He should have moved on, but staying\nseemed to delay decisions. Seemed to make things more comfortable.\nWhether it actually did either was debatable, the older him now realized. It\ncertainly looked odd for the youth with the beginnings of a mustache—\nthough he ignored it—to be sitting with kids three years younger than him.\nRenarin had never known a divided Alethkar. He’d been born into a\nunited kingdom, son of the mighty general who had forged it. Yet many\npeople remembered the time before unification—and today was when\nRenarin had realized his father’s prominence would not always protect him.\nAfter the second course, Renarin had gotten up to find the privy. He did so\nagain now, slipping from the feast hall, playing with the buttons on his\nsleeve—and there encountered the older boys.\nHe remembered jumping in surprise at that, though today he expected"

They\nwore fine clothing; the sons of the elites who, seeing the winds turning, had\njoined with Gavilar. These boys didn’t remember the old kingdom, but their\nparents did—and their thoughts had a way of seeping into the children, like\nink through too-thin paper. A metaphor that made him smile, as he would\nnever have considered it before learning to write.\nAs he walked past the boys, they followed, taunting him. He stopped,\nthen turned, and the elder him saw something new he’d missed when\nyounger. Those nervous postures, the way the boys kept glancing to one\nanother, feeding their actions with nods? These boys … they were afraid.\nThey surrounded him, shoved him up against the wall, as in this vision\nhe wore the body of a child. They demanded to know if he thought he was\nbetter than they were. Now, he realized they were testing limits. In their\neyes, Dalinar must be ashamed of his youngest son, to make him sit at the\nchildren’s table, to refuse him training with the sword. They wanted to see\nhow far they could push that.\n“I remember you,” Renarin whispered. “I will remember this for a long,\nlong time.”\nThey frowned, as that hadn’t been the expected response. Yes, he\nremembered this day. It had been one among many mounting days that had\nmade him realize he didn’t understand people. He’d been so completely\nbaffled, so ashamed. Why would his friends—people he perceived as his\nfriends—treat him this way? Where had these sudden emotions come from?\nWhat had he done wrong, and could he be sure to never do it again?\nHe wasn’t that boy any longer.\nRenarin swept the legs from under the lead boy, knocking his head on\nthe floor. Zahel hadn’t taught Renarin much hand-to-hand, but this move\nwas one he’d claimed was essential. So many situations became so much\nmore manageable when the other fellow was on the ground.\nThe other boys froze for a moment, then one shoved Renarin against the\nwall once more while another helped their fallen friend. Renarin suffered it,\nexamining how he felt. He hoped that fighting back would give him\ncatharsis … but no. This was merely a vision. Nothing here meant anything.\nBeyond that, he was Radiant now. He was supposed to be better than this.\nHe braced himself to take a punch or two, but then Adolin—as had\nhappened in the original experience—ran up. Dear, earnest Adolin,\nshouting, trailing pools of angerspren. Four boys, and just one Adolin, but\nthey were frightened of him. He carried a sword, but didn’t need to use it as\nhe got in the face of the leader of the band—the eldest boy, who was\nAdolin’s age—and threatened a duel.\nAnd storms, Renarin loved him for it. He didn’t need saving as he once\nhad, but he remembered how it felt when Adolin had shown up. Like a hero\nfrom some story, arriving at the first break in the clouds after a highstorm."

Like a hero\nfrom some story, arriving at the first break in the clouds after a highstorm.\nAnd young Renarin hadn’t realized these boys would never actually injure\nhim. He’d been afraid for his life.\nAdolin Kholin had been protecting the weak since he could walk.\nStrange, that Renarin was now the knight.\nIs this why you wanted to train and become a soldier? Glys asked.\nBecause you wanted to be like him?\n“No,” Renarin whispered. “I wanted to not need him.”\nYou were just thinking of how you love the way he helped.\n“I do,” Renarin said as the boys ran off. “But I don’t want to have to rely\non him, Glys. All my life, I’ve needed the help of others in a way my father\nand my brother never did. I like to think that has taught me a thing or two,\nbut storms … this day. This storming day.”\nWhat will this day do to the young you?\n“Show me that I can’t trust people,” Renarin said. “Because I can’t read\nthem. For years I was afraid that every friend would turn out to secretly hate\nme. Afraid that if I had to fight, my blood sickness would leave me\nincapable. So when I had a chance to be a soldier, to wear Plate at last, I\ntook it.”\nAdolin turned to him and asked if he was all right, promising to teach the\nboys a lesson. He would. Adolin was already a rising star as a duelist, and\nsoon all would know that if anyone treated Renarin poorly, they could\nexpect a challenge.\nRenarin would always love his brother for that, and would always\nquietly resent being unable to do it for himself.\nRlain hummed to the Rhythm of the Lost, because he was here in a vision\n… with Eshonai.\n“We’re losing too many people,” she said, pacing before them in her\nShardplate as they met to discuss strategy. They were all in warform, but\nshe towered over them in their seats. “If we continue like this, the humans\nwill wear us down until we’re nothing. An axe with no bite—all handle.”\nOutside he could see old Narak, as it would never exist again. Open\nplateaus with no fortifications. Homes made by listeners out of whatever\nthey could find, augmenting ancient stone buildings overgrown with crem.\nA high sky, blue, above plateaus like islands.\nFor a while here, he’d thought it would all work out. Then the humans\nhad refused to leave, and had begun to win.\n“What if,” Thude said, “we sent spies among them?”\nEshonai turned on her heel to regard him. She hummed to Appreciation,\nindicating he should continue.\n“We could have someone take dullform,” Thude continued. “It is enough\nlike slaveform that no human will notice.”\n“They have enslaved ones serve meals,” Bila said, to Appreciation as\nwell. “Clean. Carry. They are around all the time.”\n“It’s true,” Eshonai said. “I saw that in their palace. They ignore us.\nWe’re practically invisible to them.”\n“So a spy could get close,” Thude said to Excitement. “He or she could"

We could start raiding close\nto the warcamps again.”\n“If we started taking all of the gemhearts,” Harvo said, “perhaps we\ncould starve the humans out.”\n“It’s a clever idea, Thude,” Eshonai said to Consideration. “Let’s try\nsending one at first—maybe to visit that lumber operation upriver—and see\nhow they’re treated. See how long they can stay without being recognized.”\nRlain hadn’t realized how painful this day was to remember. He attuned\nTension as he considered what was about to happen. Because Thude\nvolunteered first.\n“I could do it myself,” Thude said. “I know the way.”\n“Don’t be a fool,” Eshonai said. “What if the humans attack you on\nsight? We can’t afford to lose your prowess in battle, Thude.”\n“Though our food stores would likely thank us if you were gone …” Bila\nadded with a laugh.\nRlain squeezed his eyes shut, and Tension thundered in his mind.\nBila tried to volunteer next, but Thude objected. “I can’t lose you,” he\nsaid to her.\nHarvo tried, but was deemed too useful to their farming, and was\nrejected too. Tusa was essential for research.\nThe room grew quiet.\n“I’ll do it,” Rlain said, opening his eyes.\nThey looked to him, and several seemed to have forgotten he was even\nin the room. They’d just been talking about how the parshmen were\ninvisible to humans, but they treated him the same way a lot of the time.\nHe waited for the objections, or at least for someone to say they’d miss\nhim. Instead they all perked up.\n“That’s an excellent idea,” Thude said.\n“You’re perfect,” Tusa agreed.\nEven Harvo, one of his best friends, said nothing. It was still awkward\nbetween them—what had happened while Rlain had been in mateform. He\ndidn’t think the others treated him too differently as a result; they thought it\nwas amusing, like most of what happened during mateform.\nNo, they simply … well, they didn’t know him. They didn’t care to know\nhim. He was always there, but never relevant. The quiet one at the edge of\nthe conversation.\n“You don’t currently have a warpair,” Eshonai said. Of them all, only she\nhad ever appeared the least bit hesitant about sending him into danger.\nEshonai, however, was also a general—and had to focus on the good of\ntheir people. “You are a capable soldier, and can get yourself out if things\ngo poorly. Thank you for the offer, Rlain. I think this will work.”\nIn the moment, he’d felt proud to be able to offer something other than\nhis knowledge of farming. After this day, he would train to become a spy\nand infiltrate the humans. But in the subsequent years, things would go\nwrong.

What was this?\nAdolin held up the device, which looked like two small spyglasses\nattached together, with a metal hinge between them.\n“They’re called binoculars,” Colot said.\n“Fabrial?” Adolin asked, noting the gemstone contraptions at the bottom.\n“Yes,” Colot said, “but the lenses don’t need that apparently. Here, turn\nthis dial at the top to change the focus.”\nAdolin lifted the thing to his eyes, scanning the city and adjusting as he\nwas told. Storms … they worked beautifully, and magnified better than any\nspyglass he’d used—with the added benefit of depth perception.\n“Look up to your right,” Colot said. “Then, to activate the fabrial\nportion, acknowledge that you’re seeking living things seen only through\nthe lenses.”\nAdolin frowned.\n“Don’t ask me,” Colot said. “Evidently you need to indicate what you\nwant to the fabrial spren, otherwise it will just locate the nearest people—\nwhich would be us.”\nJust locate the nearest … Adolin jumped as lights inside the lenses lit up\nwhen he passed a certain section of the sky. He focused there and moved\nthe dial, zooming in, and found he could make out a group of four Heavenly\nOnes in the air.\n“Storms …” He lowered the binoculars, squinted, and couldn’t make\nanything out. He raised the binoculars again, and while the figures were still\nsomewhat small, he could make out the long ribbons of clothing they wore,\nflapping in the wind.\n“I need as many of these devices as we can get,” Adolin said. “I want a\nhundred. I want them in the hands of every scout, every scribe, every rear\nguard and bodyguard.”\nColot chuckled. “The Azish have one pair, which they finally got\nworking yesterday. I don’t think it’s for sale.

Find Notum and send him to me. Something’s\ngoing to happen today, and likely soon.”\nNavani walked the halls of Urithiru in the past. And it was so very wrong.\nBack in the Physical Realm, she’d been growing accustomed to the new\nversion of the tower, with bright glowing lights within the stone, spren at\nevery corner, and a feeling of vibrant alertness. Pumps churning, air\nblowing, people thriving.\nShe also remembered well the slumbering version. The lights having\ndrifted off, sleepily, thousands of years before. The machinery working in a\nstate of basic maintenance. A city waiting for renewal.\nThe tower of this vision was between those two. The lights were there,\nburied in the stone strata, but they were weak and frail. The machinery\nworked in fits and starts, and spren hid in the corners, frightened. She knew,\nfrom recovered records, what was happening: the Radiants were\nabandoning the tower. It was going to sleep.\nThat half state, like a creature half-formed, unnerved her. She carried\nGav, and found herself checking over her shoulder nervously at each\nintersection.\nDalinar didn’t seem to notice the wrongness; his attention was on that\nRadiant from his other vision. The one who would be first to give up his\nShards. They followed the man down one of the main thoroughfares of\nUrithiru, and people made way for him, with his flowing blue cape and\nmagnificent living Shardplate. Windrunner, she assumed from the armor—\nwhich was sleeker than most, and glowed the right shade, though his glyph\nwas an antiquated version of the one that read “peace.”\nNavani and Dalinar followed after, joining the traffic working its way\noutward toward the Oathgates. These people were wheeling their\nbelongings in carts and were dressed for travel, carrying children. The\nlimited records that had been left behind didn’t say why the tower had been\nabandoned. The Sibling probably could have told her, but there had been so\nmuch to do in the last few days, Navani hadn’t thought to ask.\nPeople pooled at the front gates, but the Windrunner took to the air and\nsoared over them. Navani didn’t know how they looked to these people, but\nit didn’t seem they were anyone important, as she and Dalinar had to work\nto get through. Fortunately, Dalinar was good at this sort of thing.\nEventually they reached the front of the crowd—forcing their way out\nthe front gates—and saw a standoff. A large group of Radiants, over a\nhundred strong, in a variety of dress had gathered outside. There appeared\nto be no standardized uniform, though many of them wore takamas with\nopen-fronted robelike shirts for the men and chest wraps for the women.\nIt was strangely invigorating for her to see the ancient dress, her people’s\nheritage, here.

Many of the darkeyes around her were wearing\nsimilar clothing, though those from other countries—like the Azish—were\ndressed differently.\nThese gathered Radiants were either Windrunners or Skybreakers,\njudging by how many hovered. She guessed they were all the latter, for\nwhen the man they’d been following lowered down in his Plate before\nthem, they—virtually as one—had turned hostile postures toward him.\nThree even summoned their own armor.\nA man in green seasilk clothing got between them, then thrust his hands\nout to the sides—one toward the Windrunner, one toward the Skybreakers.\nHe said something, but Navani was too distant to hear. She nodded to\nDalinar, and they tried to move forward—but a line of other Radiants barred\nthe way.\n“Radiant business,” one of them said to him. “Let the Bondsmith handle\nit.”\n“I have urgent information for him,” Dalinar said.\n“It can wait.”\n“But—”\n“It can wait,” the Radiant said, trying a glare on Dalinar. Who glared\nright back.\nNavani pulled him away. “Starting a fight won’t accomplish anything.”\n“These visions are useful,” Dalinar said, “but I hadn’t appreciated how\nthe other ones were curated for me.”\n“What do you mean?” Navani said, soothing Gavinor with a hug, who\nwas looking at the tower and asking if they were home.\n“When I was experiencing that first set of visions years ago,” Dalinar\nsaid, “they placed me right at the center of events, in a prime spot to\nobserve or even participate. They were selected for that purpose. These are\nmore haphazard. We’re just showing up in whatever body happens to be\navailable.”\n“So what do we do?”\nHe narrowed his eyes and glanced over his shoulder past the Radiants.\n“Navani, there’s a line of light Connecting you to that man between the\nWindrunner and the Skybreakers.”\n“He’s the tower’s Bondsmith during this time. We learned his name from\nthe records: Melishi.”\n“I’m … going to try something,” Dalinar said. “If it’s all right with you.\nI think if I enhance that Connection …”\nIn the blink of an eye, Navani had shifted across the plateau. She now\ntook the place of that Bondsmith—standing between angry Skybreakers and\nthat solitary Windrunner. She shook herself, reorienting. She looked like\nherself, at least to her own eyes, but it was clear she had taken the\nBondsmith’s spot in everyone else’s eyes.\nStorms. Dalinar could have given her a moment to agree before doing\nthat.\n“Please reconsider,” the Windrunner was saying. “We need to stay\ntogether.”\n“It’s far too late for that, Garith,” said an armored woman at the head of\nthe Skybreakers, her feet hovering a foot off the ground. “The time for\nbeing ‘together’ ended years ago, when you condemned Kazilah.”\n“I’ve apologized for—”\n“There is a rift here,” the woman said, raising her voice, drawing\nangerspren as a pool on the ground below her. “A rift formed by lies.

No one wants our oversight, so why bother?”\n“Because,” Garith said, “after years, we actually have a duty to\nperform!”\n“You speak of this new movement among the singers, the parsh,” the\nSkybreaker said.\n“Something must be done about them,” the Windrunner said. “For over\ntwo thousand years the Radiants haven’t had a true enemy—save for flare-\nups of the Unmade. Now an enemy presents itself. This is a chance to unify\nus again! The parsh have Surges. This was all supposed to be over, yet they\nfight on.

Yes, apparently so.\n“I think,” she said, “we’re all a little too emotional right now. Why don’t\nwe talk it over in a calmer setting?”\n“Calm?” the Skybreaker said. “Melishi, the tower is dying. The\nprotections are vanishing. You yourself called for the evacuation!”\n“He said we’d return,” Garith said. “It’s temporary.”\n“Then why all those barriers around the Sibling?” the Skybreaker\ndemanded. “If it’s temporary, why not just weather it, ship in food?” She\nnarrowed her eyes. “No, something is happening. I will not live here if even\nthe Bondsmith is lying.”\n“Show Melishi a little trust,” Garith said. “He—”\n“Trust?” the Skybreaker said. “Trust, Garith? What about your lies?\nWhat cons are you running, while pretending you are so valiant?”\nThe Windrunner recoiled, floating back a foot as if by instinct, his eyes\nwide.\n“Yes, I’m well aware of how you keep holding things back from us, and\neven the other Windrunners,” the Skybreaker said. “What are you hiding?”\nShe spat on the ground before Navani. “The truth becomes a frailer memory\nhere, day by day. Our new leader has told us where we came from, what\nhumankind did to its homeworld, and you two refuse to let me tell\neveryone. Liars. Liars to the core.” The flying woman stared straight at\nNavani and continued. “We’ve told everyone else the truth anyway. Deal\nwith it.” She gave what appeared to be a salute—arm overhead—but done\nironically, then waved to the others. They flew off in a group.\nNavani forced herself not to feel insulted or ashamed.

The records they’d found indicated a mass abandonment of\nthe tower, led by Melishi. They had also referenced the tensions between\nWindrunners and Skybreakers.\nGarith the Windrunner lowered down next to her. “It’s unraveling,\nMelishi,” he said softly. “I warned you this might happen, if you couldn’t\npersuade the Sibling. The tower is a symbol. Losing it …”\n“I have done all I could,” Navani said, needing to give some response.\n“I wish I could be convinced that was true,” he said. “I sincerely wish\nit.” Storms. The coldness from him was practically palpable. “I will gather\nthe Radiants at the camp near Cabridar and try to make a new place for us\nthere. But the enemy moves toward Iri, and Feverstone. Fighting will come\nfor us soon—and if the Skybreakers have told everyone the truth of our\nhistory … there will be more disagreements.”\nHe rose off the ground to go, but Navani realized she needed to try for\nmore information. “Wait,” she said. “What of this accusation, Garith? That\nyou’ve been lying? About what?”\nHe drew his lips to a line, and offered no excuse or explanation as he\nsoared away toward the upper reaches of the tower. Navani was left alone\non the empty plateau before the Oathgates, enveloped in a familiar\ncoldness.\nAdolin found Commandant Kushkam in one of his customary locations, on\nthe balcony in the dome, surveying the Oathgate battlefield. It had changed\ndramatically in the four days since the fighting had begun, and was unlike\nany that Adolin had ever seen. The bronze fortification at the center,\nroughly circular with a rounded top, had expanded further. It could hold\nseveral thousand now. Outside it was a long, wide ring of stone ground that\n—despite the dim light—Adolin knew was coated in crusted blood and\ncorpses. No rainwater would fall in here to wash that away.\nThat wide field was also strewn with debris that had been pushed\noutward, in columns, thirty or forty yards by the attackers as they made\ntheir assaults: forming barricades behind which the defending soldiers\nsometimes took up positions. All together, it formed a star pattern.\nMore debris was on its way—the emperor’s own furniture, as he’d\ninsisted. Yanagawn confessed he had rooms full of it that he’d never used,\nand so what was now being thrown down onto the field was their finest—\ngold and red, occasionally jeweled, glittering in the darkness. No\naluminum, though evidently there was a ton of that in the palace just\nhanging around as picture frames and dining ware. What a strange place\nAzir was.\nRegardless, they were at a lull in the fighting for the moment—\nsomething that was becoming rarer and rarer as the enemy tried for\nconsistent attacks. Adolin liked to think the defenders had done enough\ndamage to make the enemy wary; they had the numerical advantage, but\ntheir forces weren’t infinite. They sometimes had to pause to reassess.\nAdolin walked up to Kushkam—pushing aside a yawn, refusing to give"

They sometimes had to pause to reassess.\nAdolin walked up to Kushkam—pushing aside a yawn, refusing to give\nin to the fatigue—and leaned against the rail by him. Kushkam didn’t speak\nat first. The commandant was like a small chull in the shadows: stout but\nsturdy.\n“We still have that oil,” Kushkam said, referencing the oil sacks tied to\nthe top of the dome, rigged to fall upon command. A trap set up before the\nenemy had even arrived. “We might have to use it soon, Adolin. They\nalmost broke us last time, and half my forces had retreated into the hallways\nbefore the Shardbearers hit the enemy.”\n“If we use the oil, we lose the dome.”\n“I know. I believe you.” He heaved a sigh. “We might not have a choice.\nWhat about caltrops? Our remaining Soulcaster can make bronze ones.”\n“Singer feet are tough, Kushkam,” Adolin said. “I don’t think they’ll be\nstopped by that.” He ground his teeth in thought. “I like your other idea\nthough. Plugging the passageways.”\nThe idea was to fill some of the hallways with Soulcast bronze, so when\nthe enemy battered down the door, they found the path had turned solid.\nTrouble was, if they plugged too many, their own forces couldn’t make it in\nto fight.\nBut … Kushkam was right. They were close to losing the dome entirely.\nPlugging the exits, then, might be another last-ditch method of slowing the\nenemy.\nKushkam nodded. “I’m trying to find a towers analogue that move\nwould mirror.”\n“Don’t think there is one except for Zenaz’s Final Adage.”\n“‘Never assume,’” Kushkam quoted, “‘the game actually replicates real\nlife.’ Well, I’ll see about plugging some of the exits.” He pointed to the\nfield. “For now, see that larger corridor across the way, where they’ve\npushed debris to the sides more than others? I think that happened\nintentionally, not as part of a failing line. I suspect they’re preparing that\ncorridor for a large assault today.”\n“We’ve spotted the Heavenly Ones hovering right outside the city,”\nAdolin said. “Hopefully that’s all there are—the enemy keeps patrols all\nthrough this region, and might have assigned one to come here for support.”\n“And if they brought other, more dangerous Fused with them?”\n“That could be catastrophic.”\nKushkam grunted. “Let’s put the reserves on alert. We’re likely looking\nat a large offensive either way.” He paused. “You think they could have\ngotten more Fused here on the other side? Flown in through Shadesmar?”\n“Yeah,” Adolin said. “Heavenly Ones are slower than Windrunners, but\ngiven several days … Well, we should be ready.”\nKushkam leaned toward Adolin. Sensing the man’s mood, Adolin also\nleaned in so they could speak more privately. The archers and scribes on the\nbalcony were already giving them some space, but the two lowered their\nvoices anyway.\n“Adolin,” Kushkam said, “how do we stand against this? Please tell me"

Please tell me\nyou have some way we can be ready for more Fused. My men are\nexhausted, wounded, and now demoralized because the reinforcements\nhave failed to arrive.”\n“I … I don’t know,” he said. “Zarb, I wish I had an answer, but … I\ndon’t. Fused are going to be tough no matter what. We can watch for\nMasked Ones—I’ve already been telling the men to be suspicious of any\nhumans trying to escape out the doors from inside here. But Flowing Ones,\nMagnified Ones, Altered Ones, Husked Ones … storms. We have trouble\nfacing them with Radiants.”\n“This will break us,” Kushkam whispered. “I won’t speak these fears\neven to my high officers, but to you …” He glanced at Adolin. “What do we\ndo?”\nIt broke Adolin’s heart to have no answers. Again, he felt as if he were\nback in Kholinar as it fell. Then, whispered into his mind from somewhere\ndistant, Maya’s voice. Three words.\nHold. Help. Comes.\nStorms, he would not give in to this despair. “Help is coming,” he\npromised Kushkam.\n“Your spren?” Kushkam said. “When will she arrive?”\n“I don’t know,” Adolin admitted.\n“What good can more honorspren do though? Notum is helpful, yes, but\nwe don’t need more scouts—and we don’t have time for Radiant bonds.”\nAdolin hesitated, uncertain.\nHelp. Comes, Maya promised.\n“We just have to hold,” Adolin said. “Help is coming.”\n“A miracle? Is that what you’re promising, Adolin?”\nWas he? He floundered, for while he trusted Maya, the more he thought\nabout what he’d asked her to do—fetch more honorspren—the less he\nthought it would help.\nStorms, he should be able to protect this city without that, shouldn’t he?\nHe was the Blackthorn’s son. His father would have found a way.\n“The enemy can’t merely defeat us,” Adolin said. “They have to hold the\ncity. Maybe we can win even if we lose the dome. I still don’t have a good\nlegal definition of what it means to hold the city. My scribes and yours have\nbeen going in circles over the relevant statutes.”\n“Likely it means conquering the palace,” Kushkam said, “and holding\nthe throne itself. ‘As long as the emperor is on his throne, Azir stands.’”\nAdolin cocked his head, remembering hearing Noura say the same thing.\n“Is that a common phrase among your people?”\n“Yes. Three centuries ago, during the chaos at the fall of the Dusqqa\nDynasty, it was proven in court. One family tried to set up a rival imperial\nseat in another city, but the judges decided that the family that held the\npalace—specifically the throne room—was the true ruler.”\nAdolin smiled. “Sometimes you talk like Jasnah, Zarb. I don’t think I’ll\never get used to you all needing to take history lessons to become soldiers.”"

I don’t think I’ll\never get used to you all needing to take history lessons to become soldiers.”\n“There are certain advantages,” he replied. “Then again, the Alethi\nmethod has its charm. You don’t waste time teaching men to read or sing.\nYou put them in armor, give them a sword, and train them to kill … There’s\na reason you’re the most feared military in the world.”\n“Well, if you’re right about the throne, then we know their goal. The\npalace should be our fallback position.”\n“Know your enemy’s goals,” Kushkam said. “It’s always an advantage.\nI’ll ponder how we can reinforce that fallback, but … if things keep going\nas they are, we might not even have the troops to man the palace walls. So\nfor now, I want to make sure our reserves are ready for a push today.”\nAdolin nodded and withdrew, meaning to go check on his Plate. On his\nway along the balcony, however, he encountered an Azish girl struggling to\npull back a bow. He fought off a yawn, nodding to May Aladar, and tried to\nremember the young girl’s name.\nZabra. That was it. “Harder than it looks, Zabra?” he asked.\n“They made it too hard,” Zabra complained. “I know there are bows with\nless of a draw than this.”\n“We’re fighting singers,” he said. “Warforms mostly. They’re well\nequipped, and naturally armored. We need bows with a good draw weight to\nhave any hope of bringing them down.”\nZabra deflated. She wasn’t much shorter than many of the soldiers, but\nshe had a willowy form.\n“May does it,” Zabra whispered.\n“Captain Aladar,” Adolin said, “has been training in the bow for a\ndecade. I believe I told you that it would take you years to get to fighting\nshape.”\n“It’s not taking the emperor years,” Zabra muttered. Then she cringed,\nglancing around to make sure none of the Azish archers were near. “I know\nyou’re training him. Everyone whispers about it. He’s never held a sword,\nyet you’re going to put him on the front lines.”\nAdolin chuckled. “The front lines?”\n“Well, you might. What’s the difference? You’re going to tell me it’s\nbecause he’s a man, aren’t you? And an important one?”\n“Well, the ‘important’ part would keep him out, in your culture,” Adolin\nsaid. “But you know he had training with knives as a boy, right?”\n“We’re … not supposed to talk about that time.”\n“Must be hard,” Adolin said. “Regardless, he has some good fighting\ninstincts, and I can work with those. Finally, there’s one important factor.”\nShe frowned in the dim light, trying to figure it out.\n“Shardplate,” Adolin said. “Technically, all of the empire’s Plate belongs\nto the emperor. If he ever has to put that on to keep him safe, I want him to\nbe capable of using it. If he’s ever on the battlefield, he’ll be in Plate. It\ndoes a great job equalizing for skill.”\n“So …” she said softly. “You’re saying I need to get me a set of"

Then she smiled at his shocked\nexpression. “Or I could do the reasonable thing and find me a spren. I think\nI’d like being able to melt stone with a glare.”\nHe gave her a smile as May reclaimed the bow and sent Zabra running\nwith a message to check on arrow supplies.\n“Sorry about that,” Adolin said as Zabra left. “I should have asked before\nhanding her off to you.”\n“Eh,” May said. “She’s easy to motivate, which is useful. You look\ntired.”\n“I’m not tired.”\n“You look it.”\n“Too dark in here for you to tell.”\n“You just yawned. How much have you been sleeping?”\n“Are you my mother?”\n“I’m your ex. Which makes me the closest thing your wife has to an\nadvocate here, plus I’m technically your head scribe for this deployment. So\n…”\n“Not sleeping enough,” he admitted, his mind drifting toward Shallan,\nand his worry for her. “But sleeping more than I feel I should. I’m good for\nnow, May. I promise.”\nOne of his usual scribes would have accepted that—they knew if they\npushed, and he pushed back, he could be trusted to make that decision. May\nremained skeptical. Before she could order him to sleep though, a line of\nblue light came shooting through one of the balcony doorways.\nNotum appeared as a human-size spren. “Sir, you need me?”\n“Can you still see into Shadesmar?” Adolin asked. “You’re not fully\nbonded.”\n“I’m not any bonded,” Notum said, and closed his eyes. “I can catch\nglimpses. I don’t think I can tell you much—the enemy has gathered many\nof their assault troops on this side, I believe. It …” He paused. “Wait.”\n“Fused?” Adolin asked, stomach sinking.\n“Yes,” Notum said. “And worse. Large shadow. Red eyes. That’s a\nthunderclast soul, Adolin. It—”\nAdolin went running, shouting the alarm and calling for his armor.\nTrumpets of warning started sounding as he burst out of the dome. On the\nelevated ramp around the outside he spun, searching until he saw something\nhuge and hulking rising from the field right outside Azimir.\nHis greatest fear had arrived, in the form of a mountain of stone bent on\nbreaking open the dome.\nSomehow, I’ve never been good at this. Ten thousand years, and\nsome things I just cannot learn.\nThe enemy arrived. Hitting Narak Prime, exactly as Sigzil didn’t want them\nto.\nSo he fought, hoping his plan with the Lightweaving would divert them.\nFor now he had to hold the skies, creating burning eyes with a silvery spear.\nVienta began spinning around him as he flew between clashes, a woman\nshrouded in flowing cloth.

Though he knew she felt more comfortable\nhidden, she remained visible to encourage him as he soared through the\nEverstorm’s omnipresent darkness.\nKeep going, Sigzil. This is where you belong: the scholar with a spear.\nHe hadn’t fit in with the scholars at home because he didn’t like sitting\nin musty rooms reading. He’d wanted to be out doing field research,\nlearning and experiencing. That was why Master Hoid had chosen him as\nan apprentice. And it was why he was an effective Windrunner.\nAnd now, why he could lead.\nHe summoned his Shardspear and plummeted from the heights, joined\nby a force of thirty Windrunners glowing Radiant in defiance of the eternal\nnight.\nThey clashed with the Skybreakers, who’d flown in to give air support to\nthe major offensive against Narak Prime. Those Focused Ones had proven\ncapable of launching boulders with their springlike musculature, and were\ntrying to bring down walls. That meant the defenders had to change tactics\n—sending forces out to harry advancing enemies, rather than only flying\nabove the plateau.\nIn a moment, Sigzil was fighting for his life again. The Skybreakers\nfought wordlessly, never responding to demands or questions. Slate-faced\ndestroyers who burned the air, a rare few of them wearing glittering\nShardplate. At least Nale himself was nowhere to be seen; Sigzil did not\nfancy his chances against a Herald.\nHe swept with his spear, then Lashed to the side, whirling around his\nenemy—who struck at the wrong spot. Sigzil planted a dagger in the man’s\nneck from behind, and that dagger—made from a stolen enemy lance—\npulled Stormlight out. The enemy froze in the air, paralyzed by the trauma.\nSigzil released the knife hilt and left the Skybreaker trembling there,\ninstead defending against two others who tried to save their fellow. He held\nthem off until their companion’s Stormlight finally dwindled. Sigzil ducked\nbackward and yanked the dagger free, timing it perfectly, leaving the\nunfortunate Skybreaker to drop.\nThe other two dove after him, exposing their backs to Sigzil—who dove\nas well, summoning Vienta as a long Shardlance. He rammed it through one\nof their backs, then formed a Blade to sweep at the other—all while they\nfell together.\nFour figures crashed into the plateau. Only Sigzil rose, standing upright\nas a ring of Stormlight expanded from him—brushing across three corpses.\nFent and Kalleb, two of his squires, swooped in to check on him. The three\nstruck out across the plateau—one without walls, on the outskirts of the\nbattlefield—dodging between clashing Radiants.\nCome on, Sigzil thought, glancing toward Narak Three in the distance. It\nhad to be a tempting target, with those lower walls. If the Lightweavers did\ntheir job right, Deepest Ones—who peeked through walls and scouted the\narea—would soon give the report that a huge gemstone stash was there,\nheavily guarded.

Just subtle enough, just tempting enough. He had\nto hope it worked, because those Focused Ones were breaking the wall of\nNarak Prime—and the Stonewards were running low on Light to repair it.\nStorms. He’d never been in a battle such as this, full of so many Radiants\nand Fused. They dominated this battlefield, Heavenly Ones streaking\nthrough the sky. A few rare Husked Ones dropped their bodies, becoming\nribbons of light, proving difficult to target and counter. Deepest Ones\nemerged from stone where the wooden protections had been broken, while\nMagnified Ones with hulking silhouettes clashed against Stonewards who\nliquefied the ground.\nIt was madness. Traditional battle lines and formations were almost\nimpossible to maintain. Sigzil and his squires soared through this mess,\ntargeting a Focused One—who, harried from above, had been forced to\nbegin launching boulders into the sky. Magnified Ones nearby pulled large\ncarts full of the stones as ammunition.\nSigzil and his squires came in low and fast, and Sigzil dismissed his\nShardlance and yanked out a conventional sword. The two squires ran\ninterference, distracting guards. In the confusion, the enemy couldn’t\ndetermine which was the full Radiant until Sigzil had maximum momentum\nand rammed a newly formed Shardspear straight through the eye of a\nFocused One. Others nearby cursed him and began launching boulders at\nhim, but Sigzil used rapid-fire Lashings to yank himself one way, then the\nother, and left a burning-eyed Focused One behind.\nThere were barely fifteen of those left, so each one they brought down\nwas a huge loss to the enemy. After regrouping with his squires, he saw a\nheartening sight. The remaining Focused Ones suddenly pivoted, and the\nentire army charged instead toward Narak Three—with its lower number of\ndefenders and supposedly rich contents.\n“Storms!” Kalleb exclaimed, running a hand through his short dark\nbeard. “Sir, it’s working.”\nWith a sense of overwhelming relief, he checked the spanreeds strapped\nto his arm. With them he sent confirmation of the enemy’s pivot to his\ngenerals—and that the next phase of the plan could move forward. The\narmy was to act panicked, pretend they’d been caught with their trousers\naround their ankles, and mount a hasty defense of Narak Three. Encourage\nthe enemy to double down there and try to break through. It was working.\nExcept … this other spanreed? That was from Leyten. Sigzil answered it,\nand the ruby started giving a message via Windrunner code.\nFound him. North side.\nSigzil felt a sudden chill. Him.\nMoash.\nSigzil quickly sent back a message: Do. Not. Engage.\nNo response.

Two\nhorses had struggled to pull it.\nAdolin threw the top aside, revealing the chain.\nAn enormous aluminum chain—Yanagawn wasn’t the only one with\naccess to the stuff. The Radiants had been experimenting with the\nexceptionally light metal. Specifically, chains like this one sometimes\nhelped against thunderclasts.\nHe hurried to the front of the wagon, where Gallant was reluctantly\nallowing himself to be harnessed. The Ryshadium eyed him.\n“I know it’s not glorious,” Adolin said. “But it’s what we need.”\nThe horse snorted, but stopped nipping at the grooms. In the distance,\nenormous footsteps shook the ground. It was coming.\n“Two ordinary horses could barely pull this,” Adolin added to Gallant.\n“Stallions.”\nGallant eyed him, then blew out.\n“Yes, I’m trying to manipulate you,” Adolin said, with a grin. “Is it\nworking?”\nThe horse held his head high, and Adolin turned toward his team, who\nstood among waving ribbons of anticipationspren. These forty soldiers had\narmed themselves with ropes and hammers, carrying oil in barrels on their\nbacks. All had been of only minor effectiveness against a thunderclast, but it\nwas something.\nStorms, he’d hoped never to try this again without Radiants. Adolin\ngrabbed his Shardhammer from the ground near the wagon and pointed,\nraising a shout of defiance from his soldiers. Then he charged toward the\nhulking shadow that had climbed over the walls into Azimir and was\nthundering toward the dome.\nGallant strained forward, pulling the wagon—which squealed in protest,\nbut did move. Adolin’s soldiers charged with him. They somehow had to\nfight a beast made entirely of stone. Thirty feet tall, with glowing red eyes\nand a face that evoked the lean, arrowheaded danger of an axehound. This\nparticular thunderclast was more feral-looking than the one Adolin had\nfought—and failed to defeat—in Thaylen City.\nAdolin led his team along a wide city street empty of people, and had\nflashbacks to Thaylen City. Same heartbeat in the stone, made by massive\nfeet. Same sound of buildings crashing down as it brushed past them. Same\nthundering in Adolin’s chest as he faced a terrible truth.\nHe was a common man in a world of giants. Against these things, even\nShardweapons were of middling effectiveness.\nI might need you, he thought to Maya. I’m sorry.\n… Understand … she sent, distant. But … I am close … to what you\nasked …\nI fear I sent you on a meaningless chase, Adolin told her, frank. It might\nbe best if you just return.\nPlease … she replied.\nWell, he wasn’t going to force the issue. No soldier served with him who\ndidn’t want to. It was bad military practice perhaps, but Adolin did a lot of\nstupid things.

Case in point: charging a thunderclast.\nStorms, he’d forgotten how big they were.\nWhen his team reached an intersection that the looming thunderclast\nwould most likely pass, he halted them. Horns in the distance announced a\nmajor offensive in the dome. As expected, unfortunately. The enemy would\nbe keen to divide the defense. While ordinary troops were basically useless\nagainst this thing, it would be an enormous distraction for Adolin and—he\nsaw another figure running up—Neziham, the Azish Shardbearer.\n“Commandant says I should aid you,” the man said, his voice echoing in\nhis helm. “But Adolin … those horns.”\n“I know,” Adolin said, peeking around the side of the building he was\nusing for cover. The thing was crashing along the large roadway, coming\ntheir direction. “But if that thing reaches the dome, it can rip it apart and\nstomp our armies to pulp.” Adolin glanced back at Neziham, viewing him\nthrough the slit in his own helm. “The regular soldiers and the commandant\nwill have to hold the dome.”\n“They have more Fused now,” Neziham said, pained.\n“I hate it too. I’m sorry.”\nAdolin worried that the man might rush back to the dome. But as Adolin\nhad come to expect, the Azish troops were made of harder stuff than that.\nNeziham nodded to him, summoning his Blade. “For Prime and People,” he\nwhispered. “So long as the emperor is on his throne, I fight. Tell me what to\ndo.”\n“Nothing we have can hurt that thing except your Blade,” Adolin said.\n“The rest of us are here to distract it.”\n“I go for the legs, then?” he said.\n“I tried that,” Adolin said. “But it’s a lot tougher than it sounds, and it\nsounds storming tough.” He pointed to the wagon behind them. “Those\nchains can hold them briefly, trip them. My troops will oil the ground, try to\ndisorient the beast with ropes and arrows. I’ve never tried this with\nconventional troops though. We always had Edgedancers and Stonewards\n…”\nHe took a deep breath, then forged on. “I’ll run in and try to get the chain\naround its legs. If I can trip it, strike for the neck.

He stood up from the bedside of one of the wounded—he’d been\nvisiting the hospital—and listened to the horns, reading their notes.\nEnormous incursion. He took a deep breath. He wouldn’t have his\nShardbearer for this fight; he’d already sent him to join Adolin against the\nthunderclast.\nSo be it. He took his helmet off the bedside table and saluted the\nwounded soldiers. Then he pushed through the exit and onto the cobbled\nplaza outside, dominated by the giant dome. In better times, this plaza was a\nmarket filled with merchants and tents. Now it was empty.\nNo. Not empty. Those were figures rising up from the stone. Smooth-\nskinned singers with a variety of patterns, but each evoking a sense of\nemaciated, elongated limbs and wide, dangerous eyes.\nDeepest Ones. The Fused were here.\n“Yaezir,” he swore softly, gathering his personal guard. The bulk of the\ntroops would already be committed in the dome. So he sent a messenger,\nthen led the charge against the Deepest Ones himself. And prayed this\nwouldn’t be the day he saw his homeland fall.\nSigzil nearly left his squires behind in his haste to find Leyten. He finally\nspotted an isolated group of people clashing on a small plateau on the north\nside of the battlefield.\nHe summoned his Blade and came screaming in, passing puddles that\nreflected red lightning, full of corrupted rainspren. He closed in as Leyten\nand three squires faced a glowing man in black.\nThe moment Sigzil drew near, his Lashings vanished.\nEver since Kaladin had been caught by the strange fabrial that negated\nRadiant abilities, they’d trained for this. Still, Sigzil went tumbling, his\nLashing canceled but not his inertia. His training fled in the moment, and\nboth he and his squires tumbled to the ground.\nHe looked up in time to see Moash ram his Shardblade through the head\nof one of Leyten’s squires, dropping the young man with his eyes burning.\nAs Leyten swung with his knife, Moash rose in the air on a quick Lashing,\nthen kicked, sending Leyten sprawling.\nNo. No.\nSigzil tried to summon his Shardspear—but nothing happened. You\ncouldn’t do that while within one of these bubbles created by the fabrial. He\ncould almost sense his powers, and his weapon, at the edge of his reach.\nMoash’s Honorblade made him capable of using powers while the rest of\nthem could not.\nThis was a death trap.\n“Out!” Sigzil shouted to his squires. “Now! Run until you feel your\npowers return.”\n“A hundred and twenty-two feet away,” Vienta said, having noted the\nexact place they entered the field. He repeated her, sending the squires\nscrambling, panic in their eyes.\nSigzil ran the other way, toward Leyten.\n“Sigzil … I’m afraid,” Vienta said.\n“Stay hidden,” he replied. “There’s no sand that I see. No way for him to\nspot you.”"

No way for him to\nspot you.”\n“Stay strong,” she whispered as he took out the knife he’d used to kill\nthe Skybreaker earlier, though he had no intention of fighting Moash like\nthis. He kept his eyes open for the fabrial, saw nothing.\n“Leyten!” he shouted on the run. “Retreat! Now!”\nLeyten backed up, accompanied by his two remaining squires. But Sigzil\nnow saw that they couldn’t retreat. As they tried to escape, Moash—using\nLashings—cut them off. Leyten looked at Sigzil—who was dashing the\nthirty yards or so between them—then pointed to the sides.\nHis squires ran in opposite directions. Leyten stood his ground to distract\nMoash.\nNo. No, no, NO!\nLeyten tried valiantly, wielding a simple side dagger against an\nHonorblade. He wisely ducked the first strike, then got into a grapple,\nwhich held Moash off a few moments.\nSigzil arrived a second later, slamming his specialized knife down into\nMoash’s back as the two struggled.\nMoash didn’t so much as flinch, though he did turn and glance at Sigzil.\nAnd the man’s eyes were entirely crystalline.\nTwo diamonds, glowing with Voidlight, had replaced his eyes—and\nindeed, they seemed to have lanced through his skull, because pieces of\nthem jutted from the back and sides of his head. As if they’d grown in\namong his brains, crusting them like a fungus. It looked almost as if he had\na crown of crystals.\nSigzil stumbled back, yanking his dagger free, unnerved by that inhuman\ngaze.\nMoash shoved Leyten to the side in a heap—he groaned, still alive—\nthen spun and leveled the Honorblade. In the traitor’s other hand, he carried\na bloodied knife, one that warped the air.\nThen, with that unnerving gaze pinned on Sigzil, Moash smiled.\nSigzil raised his weapon—though the strange metal at the core of the\nknife could block a Shardblade, he was just a man with a knife against a\nfully powered Radiant. So, instead of doing something stupid—well,\nstupider—he kept his distance, and tried to get Moash talking.\n“Moash,” he said, “you don’t have to do this.”\n“Of course I don’t,” Moash said.\n“Why, then?” Sigzil asked, genuinely pained.\n“You ask your enemy why he fights you?”\n“We weren’t always enemies!” Sigzil said, edging over toward Leyten,\nwho was groaning on the ground.\n“We were brothers, Sig,” Moash said. “But then you chose the Alethi\nlighteyes over me—you went to them, after they murdered us, degraded us.\nAfter all that, you became hounds in the laps of the Kholins.” He pointed\nwith his sword. “I used to avoid emotion. Reject it. I welcome it now. It is\nmy sword as much as this Blade.”\n“But …” Sigzil trailed off as Moash—whose eyelids blinked normally"

But Moash Lashed himself upward, swinging with the\nknife that distorted the air.\nSigzil heard a piercing shriek that twisted his insides. But it wasn’t\nVienta that Moash struck.\nLeyten shouted in anguish and stretched bloodied fingers upward. He’d\nbeen stabbed during his clash with Moash earlier.\n“Ethenia,” Leyten whispered. “No …”\nMoash lightly floated away from Sigzil, easily staying out of his reach,\nand landed near Leyten. There, he plunged the anti-Stormlight knife straight\ninto Leyten’s chest.\n“NO!” Sigzil screamed.\nMoash stood, and glanced toward shouts from nearby—an entire force,\nfetched by the squires, running this way. He tapped his wrists together in\nthe Bridge Four salute, then took to the sky—streaking away in the\ndarkness.\nWeeping, Sigzil reached Leyten, who was bleeding profusely. “Sorry,\nSig,” Leyten wheezed. “We … we didn’t mean to engage … We were in the\nair and he swooped back on us … activated the device so we dropped …”\n“Don’t speak, Leyten,” Sigzil said, stanching the wounds, but feeling\nhelpless. Those were deep cuts. He grabbed the man under the arms. “I need\nto get you out of this bubble so you can be healed.”\n“I was stupid …” Leyten said. “I let him get another of us, Sig … I …”\nSigzil began pulling the larger man, even though his medical training\nsaid not to move someone with such serious wounds. But within this field,\nLeyten had no chance.\n“I … I see something, Sig. I see you … Storms, I am you …”\n“Don’t—”\n“I die!” Leyten shouted, spasming. “The Scholar with a Spear! I die by\nthe hands of a friend! My spren screams in death, and I know that I have\nfailed to lead! I am no captain! I am nothing! Vyre strikes me, and my eyes\nburn!”\nMoments later, a pair of Edgedancers—led by Sigzil’s squires—found\nSigzil weeping, his fingers bloody as he worked feverishly to sew up the\nwounds of a man who had already died.\nThe fabrial proved to be hidden in the shell of a rock, easy to miss. They\ndeactivated it, then stood around Sigzil, solemn. His mind was full of those\nlast words, that Death Rattle, which had prophesied Vienta’s and Sigzil’s\nown deaths by the terrible hand that had taken Teft and Leyten.\nIn the past, I’ve held on too tightly.

I’ve worked on that, but find\nthat sometimes my grip is too loose.\nNavani trudged along the plateau in front of Urithiru, feeling the incredible,\ndaunting weight of ignorance.\nTo those in this vision where she’d seen the Skybreakers leave, she\nlooked like a Bondsmith now many centuries dead, one who had let the\ntower grow cold and inhospitable. The chill air surrounded her, attracting\ncoldspren—like icicles that grew up from the ground the wrong way—that\nhad once been familiar, before the tower awoke. She turned toward the\ncrowd of people, and many shivered, pulling their arms in tight. They wore\nrobes with open fronts and skirts that went to the knee, leaving them\nwoefully unprepared for such a bout of winter.\nBut why? Why was the tower failing? Was it because of the strife\nbetween orders? It had been millennia since a Desolation—and while\nthey’d once been led by the Heralds and Honor, they now had no divine\nguidance and no enemy to fight. It was little wonder they’d found their way\nto interorder squabbling.\nAs she walked toward the silent crowd, she absently breathed in\nStormlight—it came easily, as this realm was completely suffused with it—\nand tried to sense the tower. She found only a low buzzing sound in place of\nthe expected rhythms.\nThough she did, in searching, find … something. A line? A faint teal line\nof light? She gasped, for while Dalinar had explained what he could see\nwith his powers, and while she could feel Connections at times, she had\nnever been able to see these lines. Though she’d tried reaching the Sibling\nbefore, it had always failed. But maybe here, near a copy of the tower …\nShe touched this line with her fingers, then followed it with her mind.\nShe heard a very faint, yet wonderfully familiar rhythm. Navani? The\nSibling’s voice, frail and distant. It is you!\nYes, she replied.\nI sense you, suddenly, in me—and not. How?\nI’m in a vision, she said. Of the days right before you went to sleep. I just\nwitnessed the Skybreakers leaving. Sibling, can you bring us back? We are\nlost in here.\nI … do not know how. My siblings might.\nThe Stormfather refuses, Navani said, reaching the front of the crowd,\nwhich parted for her. She walked over to where Dalinar and Gavinor were\nseated, then waved the others away—indicating she wanted space. People\nobligingly either moved into the tower or continued their treks toward the\nOathgates.\n“I’ll explain in a minute,” Navani said, at Dalinar’s questioning glance.\nSibling, she continued. Are you well in my absence?\nYes. You are here … and not here … The bond is strong enough for me to\ncontinue. But you saw them go? Those days are shadowed to my mind. The\n… Skybreakers?\nThey revealed the truth of humankind’s origins, Navani said. Then they\nleft.\nAnd … my Bondsmith?\nI’m taking his role in this vision, Navani said. Sibling, what happened?"

Sibling, what happened?\nHow did it come to this?\nI remember … fighting, the Sibling said. Angry Radiants. So many\ndifferent personalities. So many different passions. During those days it\ngrew worse. I wonder … I wonder if Mishram was behind it … But that was\nnot the reason. No. It was the Bondsmith. Melishi. He … withdrew from me,\nand sought after … You won’t like this, Navani.\nFabrials? she guessed. Our newer kind?\nYes. Melishi discovered the means of imprisoning spren. It was that,\nmixed with a feeling. I get feelings sometimes, Navani. Of what is to come. I\nsensed … pain. So much pain.\nThe Recreance, Navani replied, looking up at the tower. It’s near. A\nRadiant mentioned Feverstone—and the Recreance happened there, not\nlong after this.\nIs there … a Windrunner? the Sibling asked. One from Rira, with hair\nthe color of a heliodor?\nYes, Navani sent. I met him.\nFollow him, the Sibling said, their voice growing softer. He lies. I do not\nknow more, as it happened far from me.\nThen they were gone. Navani’s line of light faded, slipping through her\nfingers like water.\n“I saw but couldn’t hear,” Dalinar said, sitting and holding Gav in his\nlap. “You contacted the Sibling?”\nNavani nodded, settling down with him. “I lost the thread.”\n“That you found it after only a few days of practice is encouraging. The\nSibling might be able to get us out.”\n“They said they can’t,” Navani said. “But I don’t always trust that they\nknow what is and isn’t possible.” She sighed, looking back to where the\nSkybreakers had been. “The Radiants of this time discovered the truth—\nprobably from Nale—that humankind are the invaders on Roshar.”\n“Already?” Dalinar frowned, Gav in his lap holding to him with his eyes\nclosed. “I thought that happened closer to the Recreance. I believe we’re a\ngood ten years from that, based on the age of that Windrunner. But … I\nsuppose it could fit. Per the records we discovered in the tower, the\nRadiants discovered the truth, and had a plan to imprison Mishram. We had\nto connect the dots after that to determine what happened next. It could\nhave taken some years to execute their plan, and for the news to build to\nthem abandoning their oaths …”\nStorms. She smiled at him.\n“What?” he said.\n“Just imagining the younger you tracking the intricacies of historical\ntimelines, Dalinar. You could barely keep track of where you put your\nknife.”\n“I miss that knife,” he said, with a grunt, then met her eyes. “It helps that\nI care now. It helps more that I can read and write.”\nShe hesitated, trying to imagine being unable to write.

There was a\ntendency in records for women to fondly imagine their husbands as big\nclumsy beasts, uncaring for details or nuance. With embarrassment, she\nremembered a few such comparisons in her own mind. But how much\neasier was it to remember details and discover nuance when you could write\nthem out, discuss them via letters, ponder and record your thoughts?\nStorms, even look at a timeline?\nShe was quite aware of the injustices done to women by their society.\nThat did not discount the different but still debilitating ones done to men.\n“Anyway,” she said, clearing her mind, “you’re probably right about the\ntimeline. Except … are we sure the news of the truth of humankind caused\nthe Recreance?”\n“No,” he admitted. “The Stormfather is our only real source of\ninformation, as Wit said he wasn’t on Roshar for these events. But the\nStormfather holds back truths. I confronted him about this very idea, and he\ndodged the question, but even then—even before I knew he lied sometimes\n—I could sense there was more. The truth of where we came from must\nhave contributed to the Recreance, but it isn’t the only secret.”\n“The Sibling told me to follow that Windrunner,” Navani said. “He’s\ncentral to it somehow.”\n“Since he’ll be the first one to abandon his Shards and kill his spren,”\nDalinar said, “do you think it’s possible he was working with the enemy,\nplanning how to cripple the Radiants?”\nIt was an unfortunate likelihood. She sat back on the cold stone, ignoring\nthe odd looks from people who flowed from the gate nearby. How to get to\nthe next step? They needed to chase that Windrunner, uncover his lies.\nBut first a breather. Gav seemed to have fallen asleep in Dalinar’s lap,\nand while she didn’t feel sleepy, she was bearing an increasing weight of\nmental exhaustion. “Dalinar,” she said, “could you please ask before you do\nsomething unexpected with your powers? I did not appreciate being thrust\ninto the center of that conversation without warning, useful though it\nproved to be.”\n“Sorry,” he said, looking away.\n“Love,” she said, placing a hand on his knee, “you’re acting more …\noverwhelming lately. Stomping forward. Trampling over people like you\nused to. I thought you were doing better at such things.”\n“Can you blame me?” he said, quietly to not disturb Gav. A chiller wind\nfrom the nearby mountains blew across them, and Dalinar shivered.\n“Navani, what if I’m not enough? What if I can’t solve this—either through\ngaining Honor’s power or another way—and defeat him?”\n“I don’t know,” she admitted.\n“From the beginning,” he whispered, “this has all focused on me.\nVisions. Revelations. Burdens. Honor’s plan was to make Odium agree to a\ncontest of champions—which we’ve done. Now I have to find the solution.\nThe only hope our homeland has of ever being free again … and it rests on\nme. Is it any wonder I’m becoming more overwhelming?”\nShe squeezed his leg. “The man you were can’t fix this, Dalinar. He\nnever could have.”"

He\nnever could have.”\nHe met her eyes, then he nodded. “I’ll remember that.”\n“How many days left?”\n“Still three,” he said, checking. “It’s consistent—within the visions, time\npasses very slowly.”\n“We need to slip forward a little further,” she said, “without losing\nourselves.”\n“I don’t know if we have that level of control,” Dalinar said. “We keep\nstumbling around in here. If we knew what we were doing, we probably\ncould have jumped from that first vision straight to the ones we wanted.”\n“True,” she said. “But Dalinar, I think you underestimate how much\nwe’ve learned. We’ve actually made a great deal of progress in learning to\nmanipulate our situation in here, when you look at it.”\nHe grunted. “I guess you’re right. And Cultivation did encourage me to\nsee the past. I’ve done that. So next …”\n“We make another small increment,” Navani said. “A refinement, using\nwhat we’ve learned. How did you send me into this particular role of the\nvision?”\n“I strengthened the line between you and Melishi,” he said. “I figured it\nwould work, since you were both Bondsmiths of the tower.”\n“And in so doing, you exerted a new kind of control over the vision,” she\nsaid, thoughtful. “At its core, science is about control. Being able to repeat\nthe same experiment, get the same results, then use those results to your\nadvantage.”\n“So …” he said, “you’re saying if we can control the vision in a small\nway, we might be able to control the visions in a larger way too?”\n“Yes.” Navani stood. “Repeatability is one of the fundamental steps to\nunderstanding the world. Once you can replicate a result, you can really\nstart digging for the truth.”\n“I don’t know if I can replicate what I did though,” Dalinar said. “It\nworked because you were both Bondsmiths, and it felt right to Connect\nyou.”\n“Connect me to someone else,” Navani said. She pointed at some people\nwalking nearby, carrying their belongings toward the Oathgate. “That\nwoman there.”\n“Why her?”\n“She has two children, a boy and a girl,” Navani said. “Like me. She is\nroughly my age. And judging by her bearing, she is proud, although she\nwalks alone with no husband. As I did for years after Gavilar’s death.”\n“Odd …” Dalinar said.\nShe glanced at him.\n“As you said that,” he told her, “you forged just the smallest Connection\nto the woman.”\n“Perception,” she said, remembering the research into spren. “Perception\nchanges Investiture, Dalinar. Wit talked about this place, and how it is a\nshifting web of Connections.”\n“He also said it was beyond the ability to understand.”\n“He said it was beyond our ability to understand,” she replied. “But so\nare all natural phenomena, in the beginning. It is the scientist’s duty to make\nthat which was once unknowable so commonplace that you can wear it on\nyour arm and think nothing of it.”"

It is the scientist’s duty to make\nthat which was once unknowable so commonplace that you can wear it on\nyour arm and think nothing of it.”\nDalinar glanced at the fabrial clock. Then nodded, closing his eyes and\nconcentrating.\nA moment later, Navani was in the place of that woman. Carrying a large\npack with her family’s belongings, and accompanied by two children. It\nworked. She looked back across the barren plateau to Dalinar, who stood\nwith Melishi the Bondsmith. Melishi put his hand to his head as if confused,\nthen rushed off toward the tower.\nPerfect. She soothed the two teenaged children, sent them on their way\nwith their packs—even though she knew they weren’t real, she couldn’t\nhelp herself—then walked back to Dalinar. He was speaking with Gav as\nthe child stirred in his lap.\n“… It’s all right, Grampa,” Gav was saying. “Daddy told me it would be\nall right.”\n“You heard him?” Dalinar said. “Elhokar’s voice.”\nGav nodded sleepily.\n“Is that possible?” Navani asked.\n“I don’t know,” Dalinar whispered. “I feel … like sometimes I hear Evi’s\nvoice. It might be my mind pretending. At any rate, it seems to have\ncomforted him.”\nNavani nodded, looking after Melishi.\n“So …” Dalinar said, “under the proper circumstances, we can choose\nhow we’re perceived in these visions. That sounds useful. But we still need\nto jump forward a few years, to chase down that Windrunner’s secrets.”\n“You used the Stormfather as an anchor,” Navani said. “How? Can you\ntalk me through it?”\n“I was angry with the Stormfather, and I knew that he knew what I\nneeded to see. I used my Connection to him—slammed my hands together\nand made us shift here.”\n“Because the Stormfather was thinking about it,” Navani said. “The very\nsecrets the Stormfather was trying to hide hovered in his mind, forging that\nConnection for us.” She took a deep breath. “That was similar to the other\nanchors, which were related in some way to the events we saw. Well, we are\non a path toward the Recreance, and that Windrunner, Garith. This is our\ndestiny: to find why Honor died, and how.”\nShe looked to Dalinar and he stood up, disturbing Gav.\n“Navani,” Dalinar said, “that’s working. I don’t know if you’re\nreinforcing what is already there, or if you’re creating something new—but\nI feel like I can see the pathway.”\n“The Stormfather knows it,” she said, “and you have a profound\nConnection to him. Roshar knows what happened. These events somehow\nbegan the sequence that led to you and me becoming Bondsmiths. This isn’t\njust a mystery, it’s our heritage.”\nDalinar met her eyes and nodded. He had the Connection, the pathway.\nAn anchor forged of their own natures, history, and bonds. “I am in awe,\nNavani. I didn’t realize your scholarly methods could help us understand\nthe ways of the gods.”\n“Dalinar,” she said, “understanding the ways of God is the primary\npurpose of science.”"

I didn’t realize your scholarly methods could help us understand\nthe ways of the gods.”\n“Dalinar,” she said, “understanding the ways of God is the primary\npurpose of science.”\nWith that, he engaged his powers.\nAnd they appeared on a battlefield with singers arrayed before them.\nNavani, Dalinar, and Gav were among the Radiants—and in the distance,\nthat Windrunner was walking up to a tent. He was about ten years older\nnow, with greying hair—the same age he looked in the vision where Dalinar\nhad first seen him, on the day of the Recreance.\nThe thunderclast slammed a fist down, breaking cobbles. The stones\nspasmed, the near miss throwing Adolin to the ground. He scrambled\nbackward on hands and knees, forced to leave the hammer.\nThe creature raised its fist from the ground, dropping chips of broken\ncobble like clattering rain. This one walked with a hunched-over gait, still\nbipedal, but those arms were so long they would scrape the ground if it\ndidn’t curl them up while walking. It attacked again, voiceless, as Adolin’s\nsoldiers swarmed it on both sides—oil draining from the small kegs on their\nbacks, coating the stone beneath its feet. Other soldiers broke larger barrels\nat the head of the street, letting it flow down.\nAdolin puffed inside his helm, hoisting the large chain over one shoulder\n—with the other end running some forty feet back down the street toward\nthe carriage, which he’d disconnected from Gallant. The horse danced\naround, snorting, but obeyed Adolin’s strict command to stay put—between\nthe oiled ground and uneven cobbles, bringing a horse into this was begging\nfor a broken leg.\nRight, Adolin thought. Just get the chain wrapped around one leg. Use\nthe hook on the end to hold it secure.\nHe heaved forward, blessing the power of Plate to keep him moving\ndespite his mounting fatigue. He pushed into the nearest building, pulling\nthe chain with him. This was one of many tenements along the road. In\nAzimir, these tended to be nicer than in other cities—three-story rows of\nmultifamily homes, made of stone. The front room was empty, thankfully;\nthe family had fled out the rear door, leaving a trail of fearspren.\nStorms, they were lucky thunderclasts had trouble forming out of\ncovered or worked stone. Otherwise it could have emerged straight under\nthe palace, rather than approaching from outside the city. Adolin watched\nthrough the doorway, the end of the chain in his hands—each link as wide\nas his palm. In the street, Neziham distracted the thing by running past with\nhis Blade out, trying to cut at the ankle, and forcing it to dodge with a\nlumbering gait.\nThat gave Adolin a chance to duck out again, towing the chain. He\nslipped on the oil, righted himself, then scrambled toward the closest\nmassive stone foot. It was thicker than a man was tall, and looked like a\nhoof. Adolin hauled his chain around the leg—but the thunderclast moved\nand yanked the chain right out of Adolin’s grip. His end, with the hook,\nflipped away from him and crashed into a building."

His end, with the hook,\nflipped away from him and crashed into a building.\nAdolin skidded on oiled ground, then went running for the chain end.\nThe thunderclast eyed him; but before it could attack, Adolin’s soldiers\nmade a desperate play, getting in its way and shouting, making it pause.\nAdolin pulled the chain out of the crumbling facade of the building, then\nspun to see a terrifying sight: a hand, large enough to blot out the sky,\nswinging for him. Adolin dove, but got hit anyway, and was flung like a\nslapped cremling. The world spiraled around him as he tumbled down the\nroadway amid sounds of clanging metal and grinding rock.\nHe landed and groaned, lifting a dazed head. His Plate leaked Light from\nnearly every armor piece. He felt terribly dizzy as he stood up on wobbly\nfeet.\nWas the Plate … worried?\n“Not your fault,” Adolin mumbled, getting his bearings. He’d dropped\nthe chain again. Storms. He forced himself to go running for it, trailing\nStormlight. Fortunately, Neziham had distracted the thunderclast before it\ncould finish Adolin off.\nAdolin grabbed the chain and dashed to the thing’s right foot as it kicked\nwith the other, toppling a building toward Adolin’s troops. With a grunt,\nAdolin let himself slide across the oiled ground straight past the leg. Then\nhe heaved to the side, scrambling around the ankle as it slammed its other\nfoot down on the roadway ahead.\nAgain the thunderclast noticed him and swung, but Adolin ducked—\nskidding on the oil. Wind from the miss rippled pools of oil nearby, then\nthey shook violently as the hand hit the ground. Adolin managed to scuttle\nback around the thing’s heel. Here, with a heave, he slammed the hook\nthrough two of the links on the other side.\nWhen the thunderclast raised that foot to step, it towed the chain behind\nit—the other end, also with a hook, coming out of the box at the end of the\nstreet and clanging against cobbles.\nAdolin backed away, breathing hard. First part done. Now he had to link\nthat other end of the chain to something. Ideally he would wrap it around\nthe other foot, to best trip it. As he contemplated his options, he checked\nover his shoulder and saw another daunting sight.\nHeavenly Ones were buzzing high above the city, dropping boulders—\nartillery that, after millennia of practice, they knew how to make as\ndangerous as any siege weapon.\nZarb Kushkam looked up in confusion, his vision swimming, his arm\nbloodied. What … what had …\nAround him, soldiers lay dead in a blast pattern. Others continued to\nfight and shout as hands came up through the ground and seized them,\nstabbing them in the thighs.

His\nmind was …\nA shock ran through him, a sharp wave of coldness, and his mind\ncleared, confusionspren vanishing. He shook himself, and found the young\nAlethi healer at his side, holding his hand—Stormlight glowing from her.\nShe wore a dress in the middle of this chaos, bright green.\nZarb grabbed a nearby soldier. “Get her a storming helmet!” he shouted,\npointing. “And keep her alive as she heals people!” He seized another. “See\nthat he stays alive!”\nThen he pulled a pike from the hands of one of the dead and shouted the\nrallying cry. Just in time for the wall of the dome to explode outward in a\nshower of broken stone.\nBeyond it stood the hulking forms of ten beings with glowing red eyes.\nIncluding a variety he’d never seen—tall, with skin that seemed made from\ntightly wrapped belts.\nThe Fused were here. If there had ever been a time, it was now. “Tell\nthose inside the dome,” he ordered one of his beleaguered messengers, “to\nprepare to drop the firebombs.”\nAdolin’s honor guard did what they could to stall the thunderclast, but it\nhad largely broken them. Of Adolin’s forty, maybe ten remained on their\nfeet. They waved nets and shot arrows, but the thing had decided they\nweren’t a threat. It instead slammed its hand down near Neziham.\nThat was Adolin’s cue. He ducked out of the building where he’d been\nhiding—after breaking through several walls inside, dodging attacks from\nthe thunderclast until it lost him. He ran for the loose end of the chain and\nseized it, his armor leaking Stormlight—but not so furiously that he was\nworried. It should hold for now.\nAfter seeing this thing kick down buildings, he’d decided his only hope\nwas to lock its legs together. Nothing else would have any real chance of\ntripping it. He winced as a giant hand slapped Neziham into a wall. His\nPlate was in even worse shape than Adolin’s.\nKeep moving, Adolin told himself, charging across the ground with chain\nin hand.\nThe thunderclast turned and tried to step on him, but blessedly it didn’t\nhave a good line of sight straight down. Adolin threw himself to the side to\ndodge, the chain rattling. He sprang to his feet and tried to wrap it around\nthe free ankle. This time the creature simply kicked the other leg forward—\nthe one with the chain already locked around it.\nDamnation.\nThe chain pulled taut, yanking Adolin—who clung tight—away from the\nleg he’d been targeting.

They were covered in a spiderweb of fissures, the kind that, if this were\na duel, would prompt the judge to call a halt. Too much of a risk of the Plate\nbreaking, leading to injury.\nHe looked up to get his bearings, and found himself far along the street\n—ahead of Neziham, when he’d previously been behind the man. The other\nShardbearer glanced at Adolin, distracted at just the wrong time.\nNo!\nA colossal stone fist smashed down on Neziham, crushing him against\nthe ground. Plate exploded and popped in a sequence of spraying molten\nbits, and the thunderclast’s knuckles slammed into the street. Neziham’s\nShardblade clanged free, rolling across the street, and didn’t vanish.\nWhen the thunderclast pulled its hand up, the knuckles were covered in\ngore—with tiny bits of Plate sticking to it. What was left of Neziham was a\nmash of bones, blood, and steel.\nThe thunderclast reached down and grabbed the chain in its fists. Then,\nstraining for a moment, snapped the chain with a sharp peal of breaking\nmetal. It threw the remnants to the street, then continued on, relentless,\ntoward the dome.\nLeaving Adolin lying there, exhausted, dazed, and defeated.\nNINE AND A HALF YEARS AGO\nSzeth pulled to a stop in the monastery’s grand hall, sword out and\nbloodied.\nThe time had come, after years of training.\nThe time for him to take his place.\nHe glanced back, and saw blood trickling through the grooves between\nthe floor’s mosaic tiles. From above, those formed a picture of Yesoran,\nking of the Heralds. This close to the floor, each tile was more like a little\nisland—with grooves forming valleys between, the grout worn away over\nthe years. Grooves not meant for blood, but a convenient path for it\nnonetheless—like the fuller down the center of a sword.\nTuko-son-Tuko, the Honorbearer of Wind, was the fount of said blood.\nBarely on his feet, one hand pressed to his bloodied side. Their clash had\nlasted less than five minutes.\nTuko dropped his sword, his face pained as he pressed his other hand to\nhis wound. He tried to step toward Szeth, but slipped in his own blood and\nfell—his head hitting the tiles with a discomforting thunk.\nSzeth sheathed his sword—uncaring that it was bloodied, despite his\ntraining—and hurried to the fallen man. He kept watch for a dagger, in case\nthis was a feint, but saw none as he rolled the dazed, dying man into his\nown lap, holding him.\n“Honor-nimi,” Szeth said, “you fought well.”\nTuko spat bloody spittle into Szeth’s face.\nA fair reaction. Szeth calmly wiped it off, figuring that—in the agony of\ndeath—he might have acted the same way.\nWell, no, he wouldn’t have.\nBut it was understandable someone might.\n“I knew,” Tuko said. “The moment they sent you to train, I knew what"

Another of his glassy-eyed sheep. Can’t have someone\nlike me among the Honorbearers. That damnable stonebreaker.”\n“Don’t speak so of a colleague,” Szeth whispered. “Even if you are\ndying, honor-nimi, Pozen deserves better. You will soon join the stones, and\ntheir glorious—”\n“He’ll throw you away too,” Tuko said, drawing breath like hisses, in\nand out, hyperventilating against the pain. Warm blood streamed around his\nwound into Szeth’s lap. “We’re nothing to him.” He seized Szeth’s shoulder.\n“If you reject him, he will have no power over you. Walk away, and he can\nno longer see what you do. You don’t have to follow him. You …”\nTuko’s eyes went wide, and his hand squeezed Szeth’s shoulder, twisting\nthe cloth in a tight-clenched grip.\n“I climb!” Tuko shouted, ragged. “I climb the wall of grief toward the\nlight, locked away above! I climb, the weight of my darkened twin on my\nback, and seek the captive! The light I love! I … Storms … the light I\nlove!”\nThe strength went out of Tuko. A Blade clanged to the ground next to\nhim. The Honorbearer should not have insisted on a duel to the death\ninstead of just to defeat. Regrettable, but Szeth had won.\nSeven years of pilgrimage. And he had finished, the first part at least.\nNow he had to present himself to the others and be accepted. But this fight\nwould be the most painful step. He could lose fights with the others, and\nstill be considered worthy.\nWith the corpse in his lap, he blinked dazed eyes to look around the\nmonastery’s grand hall. Some of Tuko’s acolytes were openly weeping.\nOthers stared at Szeth with outright hatred. As he searched for a friendly\nface, he eventually found the Honorbearers. Sivi wouldn’t meet his eyes,\nthough Moss—a younger man like him—hurried forward.\n“Wow,” Moss said, kneeling by Szeth. “Just … wow, Szeth.”\n“I have killed,” Szeth whispered, “one of the most holy people in all the\nworld.” A foolish statement. What had he expected? This was what he’d\ncome to do.\nMoss, however, seemed to understand. He’d ascended most recently\nbefore Szeth, some four years ago. “I … had to kill the one before me as\nwell. She wouldn’t step aside once defeated. I tell myself that I’ll be wiser\nwhen it is my time to pass on the Blade. That I’ll step down when the other\nHonorbearers ask me to do so.”\n“Perhaps I will be as well,” Szeth said. “Or perhaps someone will kill me\nin delayed retribution for what I’ve done.” That felt good. Knowing that all\nof these acolytes who glared at him with such vitriol might someday have\ntheir own chance to kill him.\n“Come on,” Moss said, helping him to his feet. “We’ll go for a walk."

Training with Moss had been the best part of\nthe last years. Moss had treated him like a colleague from the start, even if\nhe was prone to boasts and showing off. Lightweaving hadn’t been Szeth’s\nfavorite of the Surges, but he would always cherish that year.\n“Will you inform my father,” Szeth said, “that I have succeeded? He will\nbe waiting outside.”\n“Of course,” Moss said. Szeth regretted sending one of Moss’s station to\ndo such a simple task, but there was no other.\nSzeth reverently placed the corpse on the floor, atop the picture of\nYesoran-son-God. He knelt and offered a prayer to the spren. Then he\nstood, slid the Honorblade out of Tuko’s blood, and walked to the other\nHonorbearers. Six had come to witness. Moss the Lightweaver. Pozen the\nElsecaller. Sivi the Willshaper. Dulo-son-Tudla, the Edgedancer. Vambra-\ndaughter-Skies, the Truthwatcher. Gearil, the Dustbringer.\nThere was no Stoneward, naturally. No Skybreaker, as that Herald had\nreclaimed his Blade. No Bondsmith, as she was busy with some kind of\nelection in the city. Now Szeth was the Windrunner Honorbearer. He\nsuddenly felt sick. This was what he’d trained for, but it felt horribly wrong.\nPozen nodded toward the Blade, which Szeth held reverently—his\nfavorite of the Blades, not just for its powers. He liked its simple, elegant\nshape.\n“Welcome,” Pozen said, “to your rightful place, Szeth.”\n“Pardon, Honorbearer,” Szeth said, “but I am not of your position yet.\nFirst, I must complete the second pilgrimage, proving myself to each of you\nin combat.”\n“Ha!” Dulo said, slapping Szeth on the back. “That’s merely a formality,\nSzeth! You think we’d let anyone unworthy get this far?”\n“You’ll visit each monastery in turn, yes,” Pozen said. “But to celebrate,\nSzeth. You’ve already proven yourself.”\nHe glanced to Moss, who had just returned. He nodded. “It’s what they\ndid for me.”\nMoss was another of Pozen’s protégés. Trained deliberately to become\nthe Lightweaver.\n“Well,” Dulo said as the group of them started to walk out, “it’s done,\nfinally. Disaster averted.”\n“Did you ever doubt?” Pozen asked. “The boy is perfect. I knew it the\nmoment I found him in that decaying so-called monastery …”\nFor all their talk of celebrating Szeth, they acted more self-satisfied than\nanything else. Even Moss ran to catch up with Pozen. The acolytes and\nshamans slipped away to mourn. Soon only Szeth, Sivi, and the corpse\nremained in the hall.\n“Shouldn’t someone … do something with the body?” Szeth asked."

Why was everyone so eager to\nbe rid of him? I spent my year training with him looking for heresy. He was\nlax with the rules, and cold toward me, but I did not think he was deserving\nof death. Did he speak against Truth when I could not hear?”\n“He did, Szeth,” she said softly, but still wouldn’t meet his eyes. It\nseemed like forever since the day he’d left Pozen’s monastery to train with\nher, now seven years past. Over five years since he’d last seen his sister.\nAnd at least a few months since that had finally stopped hurting.\n“I …” Szeth looked back at the body. “I feel sick, honor-nimi.”\n“Good.”\n“You used me to kill him,” he said. “Like a hired blade sent in the\nnight.”\n“Sent by the spren.”\n“Sent by all of you,” Szeth snapped, then felt ashamed. He’d followed\nTruth. They were not to blame. “I apologize, honor-nimi.”\n“It’s fine, Szeth,” she said. “I don’t love it either. But he was talking of\nrebellion—civil war. I suspect he didn’t say as much to you because he\nfeared that we’d sent you to him.”\n“What?” Szeth said. “Why would he even consider such a thing?”\n“We all have our reasons, Szeth,” she said, turning to go. “Most of us\neven think they’re the right ones. Come on—there are celebrations to be\nhad.”\n“When do I meet the Voice?”\n“In time. Once—”\n“When?” Szeth asked.\n“After the second pilgrimage.”\n“How quickly can I finish?”\nShe studied him.\nYou have all done well, the Voice said. Let him fly to me, then go on his\nsecond pilgrimage.\nSzeth, come to me at Ayabiza and seek the holy grotto beyond it. There,\nyou will know the full extent of Truth—and you will have your answers.\nWith you, it was both, wasn’t it? Suffocating at times, yet not\ninvolved enough at others.\nAdolin lay on the road, dazed from his failure against the thunderclast,\ntrying to push to his feet. He slipped on the oil and collapsed, hitting his\nhelm against the stones, and heard echoes of another time.\nStorms, Adolin! What are you doing!\nHe forced himself up again by his arms.\nAdolin, don’t be foolhardy! You’ll get yourself killed fighting this thing!\n“I’m …” Adolin whispered. “I’m supposed to say that to you, Renarin.\nI’m supposed to keep you safe. I …”\nI can handle it, Adolin. Just go!

When you had been\nthe best all your life, but suddenly you were obsolete?\nStill braced by his arms, he looked toward the thunderclast along a road\nstrewn with rubble. It shoved its way past buildings, leaving destruction in\nits wake. In the distance beyond, those Heavenly Ones buzzed around the\ndome. If more Fused were here … the city was lost.\nHe’d failed. Again. I … I don’t know if I can do this anymore, he thought,\nso terribly exhausted.\nHe slumped back down.\nThen felt hands on his shoulders.\nArmored though he was, he could still feel them trying to help him to his\nfeet. He glanced up and found Hmask. The Thaylen man had a head wound,\nglistening blood staining one long eyebrow and half his mustache. He tried\nanyway to help a Shardbearer many times his weight to rise.\nSomething awakened in Adolin. Memories of people to whom Adolin\nhad mattered, like a little boy in Thaylen City. And storms, there were a lot\nof little boys in Azimir. But only one Shardbearer left. Him.\nWith a heave, Adolin got to his feet, armor still in place but leaking\nsomething furious. He nodded in thanks to Hmask, then picked up one of\nthe remnants of the chain—only ten feet long—and threw it over his\nshoulder and clanked forward to pick up Neziham’s bloody Shardblade.\n“Hey,” he said to the sword, his voice muffled in his helm. “I’m Adolin.\nI need to borrow you for a little while, if that’s all right.”\nUp ahead, directly in the thunderclast’s path, was the tower he’d stood\non earlier in the morning. The watchpost. It was roughly the same height as\nthe creature, which moved slowly. Deliberately, destructively, but slowly.\nSo Adolin stumbled past the oiled ground and called for Gallant, who\nemerged from between two buildings.

They were\npart of his Identity—part of how he saw himself—so they were how the\nbody manifested when created from pure Investiture.\nSo strange, to hold his hand again. The man she’d come to see, over the\ncenturies, as the sibling she’d never had.\nThe one they’d betrayed.\nThe one they’d abandoned.\nThe one who had, through sheer determination, carried Roshar on his\nback into the modern age.\nHe mumbled that same mantra. “The time of the Return … We must\nprepare …”\nThe fighting in the square outside had grown quiet.

No more men\nscreaming for reinforcements. No more clangs of metal. No more sounds of\nstone against stone. That worried her. It meant the battle had been won.\nOr lost.\nShapes darkened the doorway, then a figure with glowing eyes stepped\ninto the long hospital corridor. Abidi the Monarch, she recognized by the\npatterns. Unlucky, to encounter him of all Heavenly Ones. Abidi liked pain.\nDoctors cringed and hid as Ash stood up. But of course, what was she?\nNothing. She’d spent centuries insisting she was nobody. She sank down\ninto her seat, trembling, and Abidi didn’t seem to notice her.\n“So,” Abidi said in the old language. Others were joining him, pushing\ninto the chamber. “The wounded.”\nAsh closed her eyes.\n“Slaughter them,” Abidi ordered. “It will demoralize the defenders.”\nSilence. Oh, people were whimpering or groaning. Some wounded\nsoldiers were standing up, trying to find weapons. But it was silent in one\nstark way that made Ash shiver.\nTaln had stopped whispering.\nThe bed behind her creaked and shifted, and she blinked away tears to\nlook up. To see him towering there in the shadows at the end of the hall.\nOne of the Fused at the other end of the room raised a sphere. Then\ntossed it their direction.\nThen gasped.\nIn the light, Taln stood bare chested and wearing only short breeches,\npractically filling the hallway that had been made into a sickroom. His\nhands clenched to fists.\n“You fools,” Ash said to the Fused. “You could have had the city, but\nyou came here. For the broken.”\nAbidi pointed, seeing them for the first time, and his eyes went wide\nwith abject horror. It was so satisfying to watch him turn and flee. Because\nTalenel’Elin, unarmed and without his Blade, was still the most terrifying\nwarrior on the planet.\nA crash broke the silence, windows cracking, air rushing to fill the hole\nTaln left when he moved. And for the first time in over four thousand years,\nthe Bearer of Agonies fought back.\nAdolin hauled himself onto the top of the watchpost. He’d climbed up the\noutside. His Plate was losing functionality, but it had been strong enough to\nhaul him up, and climbing had been better than navigating those tiny stairs.\nHe checked Neziham’s Blade, which he’d tied on with a rope.

He’d coiled the\nsnapped end around his waist, secured with a bent broken link.\nWith Gallant—who now had orders to get to safety—he’d managed to\nget ahead of the monster.

Gripping with one hand, he used\nthe hooked end of the chain to lock himself into place. This thunderclast’s\nbody—particularly a hulking portion of the back—was made up of a\ncrisscrossing mess of stone protrusions. Like a snarl of branches, with small\ngaps between them here and there. The hook fit right in.\nFrom this vantage, Adolin could see chaos around the dome—broken\nopen on one side, the enemy flooding out. Storms. The city really was lost\nalready, wasn’t it?\nHe growled, clinging to the thunderclast as it noticed him, then began\nshaking. Fortunately, its stone arms didn’t bend the correct ways to reach its\nback, but that shaking was furious. Adolin managed to hold on, barely—\nthen as it paused, Adolin pulled the Blade off his belt and rammed it into the\nthing’s back.\nUnfortunately, the sword didn’t stab deep enough to kill—not with all\nthis mass of stone on the thunderclast’s back. Either that or he just wasn’t\nhigh enough; the weak spot was the neck, at the base of the skull, and that\nwas a few feet higher up. The thing began shaking again, more furiously.\nGrowling, he left the sword rammed into the body and held tight with\ngauntleted fingers that—leaking Stormlight—were starting to lose their\nstrength.\nThe monster trumped—an awful, terrible sound. Adolin took the chance\nto grab the Shardblade and yank it out—and in that moment the monster\nbent down, then lurched upward and spun. Adolin only had one hand on it\nthis time. The forceful motion dislodged his weakened fingers and sent him\nflying.\nThe chain links snapped tight with Adolin on the end, swinging back and\nforth like a ball on a string—slamming into one side of the thunderclast,\nthen the other. His vision became a mess of cracked lines from a failing\nhelmet, and he barely kept track of what was happening, though he clung to\nthe Blade.\nThere! a chorus of voices seemed to say to him. Grab!\nHe reached out blindly, his free hand moving almost of its own accord,\nand seized hold of an upper portion of the thunderclast’s back again. This\ntime the thing tried to bend over and flip him forward so that its fingers—\nreaching toward its head—could grab him.\nAdolin screamed as pieces of his Plate began to fail, going dull and\npowerless from the lack of Stormlight. He leaped upward, using the\nmomentum of the monster’s motion, and hit the head. Slipped. Then\nrammed his Blade straight into the thunderclast’s neck.\nIt jerked upright, its head tipping back, Adolin falling free along the\nthing’s side.\nThen it froze.\nFinally, it collapsed like a felled tree.

He stood\nup among the many shifting futures.\nAnd was not afraid.\nHe’d been here. In this situation. He remembered nights early in his\nspren bond, feverishly scrawling on the floor what he’d seen and heard.\nThat had terrified him—not knowing what was happening to him, or why.\nThe Spiritual Realm was overwhelming to the senses—and he disliked\nthat—but it wasn’t frightening. He knew why he was here, and he knew\nwhat he was. No longer was Renarin a scared child needing Adolin to\nrescue him. No longer was he an abomination needing to hide while\nsimultaneously feeling he must share what he knew, in case it helped his\nfather.\nHe was Radiant. He was Truthwatcher. He was Glys’s companion. He\nwas Bridge Four. So much about the world didn’t make sense to him, but he\nknew why he was here, and that gave him a path forward. Strangely, he\nfound he didn’t fear even the gods.

In the face of the terrors he’d lived through—the terror of not\nknowing if he was mad, or if he’d somehow been corrupted and was\nserving evil—simple mortality seemed a distant nightmare, barely\nremembered.\nI am scared, Glys said. I will be destroyed. I will be erased. I will be\nhated.\n“Hide in me,” Renarin said. “I will protect you.”\nHe held out his hand, and Glys formed from the chaos—then shrank to\nthe self he preferred in the Physical Realm. The strange red crystalline\nstructure. This melded into Renarin, finding no gemheart, but a welcome\nhiding place nonetheless.\nAll felt … right with Glys then. The spren ceased trembling. Renarin\nlooked around, but found only echoes of his past, shifting and constantly\nmoving like shadowy clouds.\nThis place, he thought, requires organization to understand it. This is too\nmuch for a human mind.\nFortunately, he’d learned all kinds of strategies for making sense of a\nworld—and its people. Admittedly, something about his bond with Glys\ngave him extra advantages. He clasped his hands behind him,\nunconsciously—he realized—adopting the posture his father took at\nstrategy meetings, and he imposed his will on the surroundings.\nAround him the chaos faded, and instead a group of stained glass\nwindows grew up. Each separated from the others, like a little display in an\nart museum, with a black featureless background spreading behind. Out\nthere, he could vaguely see figures made as if out of white smoke, rising\nfrom the ground.\nHe walked along the windows, each of which bore an elaborate glass\nscene.

        "text": "scene. There was Shallan, and there his father and Navani—on some new\nbattlefield with a large tent. The stained glass didn’t move, but when he\nlooked away and turned back, it often had changed to a new perspective. He\nfocused on his father and aunt. They were at a meeting of singers and\nhumans.\nThey will be close, Glys whispered. Close to secrets.\n“And you?” Renarin said to him. “Are you safe now? From the gods?”\nYour father has drawn their attention for now.\nRenarin stopped beside a window with Rlain sitting among other singers,\nand considered how best to get his friend’s attention. Rlain had said they\nshould find Mishram’s prison, which Renarin was starting to consider.\nHe thought he could likely enter the window if he wanted, so should he\n—\nRenarin froze. One of the windows was changing. He sensed it before he\nsaw it. She was here.\nTurning slowly, Renarin picked out the window. Growing dark, with\nshards of glass colored violet, blue, and black. Ba-Ado-Mishram. That same\nsinger face from before, railing against the confines of the window. Moving\nwhen none of the others did. Shaking the glass. The windows closest to her\nbegan to darken.\nStorms. Renarin didn’t know how to react. But he … he had felt like that\nbefore. Confused, terrified, worried. Each emotion she showed was so very\nfamiliar to him. Strange. He barely understood the other members of Bridge\nFour at dinner. Why should he feel he understood an ancient spren?\nHe walked up to the window.\n“When I make noise like that,” he whispered, “it’s because I have so\nmany emotions, I don’t know what to do with them all. So they burst from\nme like a storm.”\nThe figure glared at him, seething.\nCareful, Glys warned. She would destroy you if she could. And Renarin,\nI think she has influenced your visions. Somehow, that vision with Adolin\nwas her doing.\n“Was it, now?” he said. “Why that vision, Mishram?”\nShe continued to glare at him.\n“More importantly,” Renarin said, “what did you show the others? And\nwhy?”\n“Destroy … you …” Mishram whispered, her frame vibrating. “I showed\nyou so you can find me … Find me! So I may destroy you.”\n“How tempting.” Renarin stepped closer. “I recognize it must be terrible\nto suffer imprisonment for so long, but is this any worse than the torture the\nHeralds endured at the hands of the Fused?”\nShe withdrew until the glass window showed no more than a pair of eyes\nburning in the darkness. He wondered, if he stepped through this window,\nwould he reach her? Find her prison?\nNo, Glys said. You would find nothing. She pervades this place, so she\nappears in it, but we have not found her prison.\n“How do we do so?” Renarin asked.\nDo you want to?\n“I’m beginning to think it might be the only way,” Renarin said. “Take\nthe prison, hide it elsewhere, leave the Ghostbloods to wander in here,\nseeking something they will never locate.”\nThe idea unnerved him, because he worried what Shallan wanted with"

        "text": "the prison, hide it elsewhere, leave the Ghostbloods to wander in here,\nseeking something they will never locate.”\nThe idea unnerved him, because he worried what Shallan wanted with\nthe prison. He trusted her, but he missed some subtleties of conversations,\nand he felt unequipped to say if her desires here were valid or not.\n“Thoughts?” Renarin prompted Glys.\nTo reach her, you will need … to Connect to her somehow.\n“Interesting,” Renarin said. “Like Father and Navani were doing,\ntraveling the visions?”\nYes, Glys said. Though your Connection must be deeper. They travel\nechoes of the past—you seek a hidden secret that has been locked away. You\nwill need to anchor soul to soul.\nRenarin contemplated this, before turning and walking to Rlain’s\nwindow. He took a long breath, then stepped into the glass as if he were\nentering a pond of water. Inside the vision, Rlain sat alone in a small Narak\nshanty. Head bowed, humming softly, the others having left. Storms, was\nRenarin intruding? Should he go? That was the posture Renarin sometimes\nhad when he didn’t want to be talked to or touched. If he stayed, it would be\nawkward, wouldn’t it?\nAnd yet … he remembered something that Zahel, of all people, had told\nhim. Sometimes you just have to push through. The swordmaster had been\ntalking about fatigue at the start of an exercise routine. Some days, you’d\narrive and would be eager for the exercise. Others … well, you just had to\npush through.\nWhat had Drehy said?\nIn the long run, it’s better to ask and deal with it if you’re wrong. Could\n… one just push through awkwardness too?\n“Rlain?” he asked.\nRlain glanced at him, then brightened immediately, his hummed rhythm\nchanging to the Rhythm of Joy. Storms … he’d been feeling alone, hadn’t\nhe? It was basically the opposite of what Renarin had assumed.\n“Glys says it’s all right to group together again,” Renarin said, walking\nover. “Is this your room in Narak?”\n“No,” Rlain said, settling against the wall. “This is one of the meeting\nchambers where my people discussed strategy and plans. Nothing formal.\nThis was simply … where we talked. As friends …”\nHe looked toward the ceiling. Renarin couldn’t read the meaning behind\nthose words, but the rhythm changed to what he was sure was the Rhythm\nof Annoyance. In this realm, picking those out was becoming natural to\nhim.\nI help, Glys whispered, seeming pleased with himself.\nWell, thank you, Renarin replied.\n“Annoyed,” Renarin said, settling down by Rlain, “with your friends?”\n“They sent me off to be a spy,” Rlain said quietly. “I volunteered, so it’s\nnot like I should be mad. But …”\n“You felt unwanted.”\n“Storms, but I did,” Rlain said.\n“Yeah,” Renarin said. “I know.”\n“Were you … unwanted?” Rlain asked, surprised.\n“Never overtly,” Renarin said. “And my father has grown so much. It’s"

It’s\nunfair to hold his actions as a younger man against him. You know that he\ncame to meetings of scholars last year, merely so I wouldn’t be the only\nnon-ardent man present? But …”\n“When you were young, he wanted a soldier.”\n“Even Adolin wasn’t enough for him,” Renarin said. “What chance did I\nhave?” He paused. “Why did they send you away?”\n“Well,” Rlain said, his head tipped back against the wall, “the need was\nlegitimate. It’s just that … I never fit in the same as everyone else. Nobody\nhated me. Nobody wanted to be rid of me. But when it came to losing\nsomeone they loved to be a spy, or losing me … not even Eshonai asked me\nto stay. By this point she was in a full ‘I must be a general’ mindset. I was a\nsolution to a problem. That was all she could afford to let me be.”\n“I make things difficult,” Renarin said. “Because I don’t see the world\nthe same way as everyone else, and they have to make accommodations for\nme. They have to explain differently to me, taking an extra effort. It causes\nme to feel like a burden. And … sometimes I feel it would be so much more\nconvenient for everyone if I weren’t there.”\n“It’s so awful,” Rlain said to the Rhythm of Appreciation, “that people\nhave to grow and stretch themselves around you. Becoming better.”\nRenarin smiled. Sarcasm was different among the singers, who could\ndeliberately match an incongruous rhythm to their words.\nRlain kept humming but didn’t speak. Together they gazed out the\nwindow to where the sun had set, and starspren began playing in the\nevening sky.\nI like the way he’s quiet sometimes, Renarin thought. At dances or\nparties, to make up for his awkward silences, his aunt Navani or his cousin\nAesudan had always tried to put him with someone talkative. They thought\nhe’d enjoy having someone else speak when he didn’t want to. But it had\ntaken so much effort to keep track of all the words.\nDared he ruin this? It was perfect as it was.\nNo, he thought. That’s fear talking. It’s not perfect yet.\nPush through. He braced himself for the awkwardness.\nAnd spoke.\n“What’s it like,” he said, feeling like he was stumbling over each word,\n“for a singer to be in a relationship with someone? A … romantic one, I\nmean.” He’d started. He might as well finish. “Could it ever work with a\nhuman?”\n“Oh, um …” Rlain hummed to Tension. “I haven’t thought about it,\nreally. I mean …”\nOh, storms. I’ve ruined it. I’ve gone and broken everything. I—\n“That’s a lie,” Rlain said, wincing. “I … um, have thought about it,\nRenarin.

        "text": "Renarin. A lot.”\nA part of Renarin wished he could simply vanish. Could his powers do\nthat? For once, the silence seemed far worse than words. It kept stretching\non and on and on.\n“You’ve always tried to understand me, Renarin,” Rlain said. “And\nusually you figure it out. Even though you don’t have the rhythms, you can\nread me.”\n“I just … hate seeing someone alone. In a crowd.”\n“Is that all?” Rlain asked.\n“No,” Renarin admitted.\nMore silence. More awkwardness.\nAnd then a rhythm. The Rhythm of Curiosity, hummed by Rlain. “We\npretend,” he said, “that when we’re in forms other than mateform, we don’t\nfeel attraction at all. But Renarin, can I tell you something? That’s an\nexaggeration.\n“When I’m in warform, I’m more prone to want to follow orders. That\ndoesn’t mean I’m completely without self-determination. Likewise, when\nwe’re in mateform, we feel all kinds of powerful attractions—but those\nemotions and feelings are there in other forms. Most singers stay together\nas a pair, even after children are raised. Relationships are important to us,\njust as they are with humans.”\n“Different though,” Renarin said. “It’s different.”\n“Isn’t … learning about someone different interesting?” Rlain said.\n“Like I said earlier?”\n“I … guess that it is,” Renarin said. “How do you know you’re\ncompatible? What makes you compatible? What if you spend a lot of time\ntogether, and start to form a relationship, and then mateform comes and …\nwell, it doesn’t work.”\nRlain hummed to Anxiety.\n“What?” Renarin asked.\n“That happened to me,” he explained. “The first time I tried mateform.\nEveryone expected me to bond with one of the three females from our\ngroup … and I tried very hard to get the attention of Harvo instead.”\n“A … male?”\n“I never attempted that form again,” Rlain said, humming to Anxiety,\nlooking down. “They laughed at me for months. As if I had made a mistake\nor something. They thought I was so lustful that I lost track of who was\nwho.” He glanced at Renarin. “The mateform part, it’s not as important to\nus as it seems to be to you. If we get along, work well together, that’s more\nimportant—that’s what makes us a warpair. Then the rest … you can make\nit fit.”\n“Unless, you know, you end up chasing a man instead …” Renarin said,\nchuckling. Not because he wasn’t still anxious, but because—amazingly—\nthat anxiety had begun to ebb.\n“Even then,” Rlain said. “I knew, Renarin. I was hesitant to try mateform\nfor that reason. I didn’t want to bond with any of the others. I could have\ntold them what would happen, because it was there inside me, even if it’s\nnot as strong in most forms as it is for humans. Personality compatibility,\nthough, that’s what we look for. What I’ve wanted.”\nHe looked to Renarin, then hummed to Anxiety, but while smiling.\nThat combination, Renarin thought. He’s blushing."

He’s blushing.\nRenarin took a deep breath, then pushed through this last bit of\nawkwardness. “Is it worth trying, then, do you think?”\nIn response, Rlain rested his hand hesitantly on top of Renarin’s. Renarin\nturned his hand upward and took Rlain’s—and felt heat. And beyond that,\nhe could sense the rhythms pulsing from Rlain into him.\nThe Rhythm of Excitement.\nThere was so much to do, so much to talk about, but this was enough for\nnow. He let them have silence. Just the rhythms, the heat, and two people\nharmonizing together.\nRenarin, Glys said eventually. Shallan has arrived, and is responding\noddly.\nShallan? he thought. What do you mean?\nI brought her out of her vision, Glys said, because you indicated you\nwanted to gather us again. Your window is still standing, and she’s\nwatching.\nOh, blood of his fathers. Shallan was watching? What’s she doing? he\nasked.\nHopping up and down, Glys said, making a high-pitched sound like she’s\nin pain.\nShe’s not in pain, Renarin said back, sighing. She’s squealing in\nexcitement. That girl … Maybe it was a Lightweaver thing, or maybe it was\nonly Shallan, but he’d always sensed a voyeuristic side to her. It took a\nspecial type to enjoy pretending to be someone else.\nWell, if nothing else, he was glad to be able to provide his sister-in-law\nwith some entertainment. He stood up, holding to Rlain’s hand. “Come on.\nWe need to talk about what we’ve each seen in these most recent visions.”\n“Why?” Rlain asked. “Is it relevant?”\n“I think Mishram influenced them,” Renarin said. “I just encountered\nher, and something she said makes me think that there’s a secret in what\nwe’re being shown.”\nRlain nodded, and banished the vision, still holding Renarin’s hand. And\nremarkably, as they rejoined Shallan—who gave him a thumbs-up and a\ngrin—he found that the awkwardness had passed. The future—for once—\nseemed extraordinarily bright. Like glowing, brilliant glass.\nIn the end, it is my lies that do me in. Another lesson I fail to learn\ntime and time again. I recognize this flaw. I hope it does not\nsomeday destroy me.\nAdolin came awake in a shiver of cold ice. He gasped, his eyes snapping\nopen, his muscles going tense and rigid. His vision was cloudy from tears,\nand he remembered …\nFalling.\nThe thunderclast.\nDarkness.\nSounds in his ears, foreign at first, but then … then voices he knew.\n“The leg!” That was May.\n“I can’t … I can’t do more!” A girl. The Truthwatcher. What was her\nname? Rahel? Yes … that was it …\nShe was crying.\nAdolin blinked away tears and found himself lying, still half in his Plate,\nby the broken remnants of the thunderclast’s hip—which they’d apparently"

Yes … that was it …\nShe was crying.\nAdolin blinked away tears and found himself lying, still half in his Plate,\nby the broken remnants of the thunderclast’s hip—which they’d apparently\nbeen forced to cut open using Neziham’s Shardblade to pull him free.\nAdolin was alive, but he saw something his mind refused to accept.\n“Adolin?” May said, taking him by the face. “Bless the Almighty.\nAdolin, can you hear me?”\n“My … leg …” Adolin said.\nHis right leg ended in a stump, below the knee.\n“I tried!” Rahel said, crying. “I … I can’t … I …”\n“The thunderclast pinned you,” May said, her voice calm. The calm that\nall officers were trained for at times of great emotion. “The Plate shattered,\nand your leg was mashed to basically nothing. But you’re alive, Adolin.”\nHe blinked, numb.\n“Adolin,” May said. “Rahel healed your other wounds, which were\nsevere. When we return to Urithiru, a more experienced Radiant can give\nyou your leg back.”\nRight. Of course they could. Adolin pushed through the shock. “The\ncity?”\n“Fighting on all fronts around the dome,” she said. “Archers had to flee\nas Heavenly Ones took the balcony. The dome is basically lost, and worse,\none side was blasted completely open. Kushkam was holding that gap. But\n… Notum said he hadn’t seen the commandant in some time, and his men\nwere in shambles. I think they may have dropped the firebombs inside the\ndome, but first dozens of Fused broke out into the city through the gap.”\nIn the distance, shouting. Fighting.\n“Get this Plate off me,” Adolin said, pushing himself up on one elbow.\n“It’s useless in this shape. We have to go help.”\n“Adolin, your leg—”\n“I’m our most experienced field commander,” he said, waving for\nassistance hauling him to his feet. “I must give orders if Kushkam has\nfallen. And the rest of us are needed to fight!”\nMay looked to the others—the ten or so men left from Adolin’s assault\non the thunderclast. Including stalwart Hmask, who finally—ignoring\neveryone else—helped Adolin pry free the breastplate, then climb to his\nfeet.\nTo his foot.\nTogether, they started toward the breach in the dome. Adolin relied on\nHmask and another soldier to basically carry him with one arm around\neach. They hurried as best they could, but he knew—deep down—this city\nwas lost. It had been lost the moment those Fused had arrived.\nStorms. Just like Kholinar. Anxietyspren trailed him in the shape of\ntwisting black crosses. There was nothing he could do.\nColot had been leading the defense against conventional singers who had\nbroken out of the other side of the dome. Only some ragged remnants were\navailable to face the Fused. These groups flowed together as they reached\nthe medical quarter.\nThere they found an unlikely group of reinforcements: the imperial\nhonor guard and Yanagawn himself, dressed for battle.

Adolin squeezed Hmask’s shoulder, and they\nlurched forward, limping among the bodies. Yanagawn hurried over, his\nfine cape stained with singer blood from the bodies below. It was difficult to\neven find a place to step.\n“Adolin!” Yanagawn said.\n“Excellency,” Adolin said, dazed, “did you do this?”\n“We found them like this!” he said. “I … I know I shouldn’t have come,\nbut Kushkam called up every available soldier. My honor guard wouldn’t\nleave me, so …” His sword drooped in his fingers. “I didn’t arrive in time\nfor … whatever this is …”\nThey continued picking through the field, where Yanagawn’s soldiers\nused an old battlefield tactic of searching for painspren, which would\nindicate someone alive. One cried out and pushed aside a body swarming\nwith them, where he found Kushkam. “He’s still breathing!”\nRahel ran to help, her gemstone bearer hurrying behind with a sack of\nStormlight. Adolin, Hmask, and Yanagawn picked their way toward the\nbreach in the dome. He could feel a lingering heat radiating from that hole,\nbut that hadn’t reached these Fused outside. He counted eight separate\nvarieties here—dead, tens of them. Their gemhearts crushed, their chests\nhaving been either ripped open or smashed. Storms. What could do\nsomething like this to the enemy’s most elite fighters? This many could\nhave brought down Shardbearers, Radiants. Yet he saw the bodies of\nneither.\nA ribbon of light announced Notum. “Adolin,” he said. “Firebombs were\ndeployed in the dome. Those conventional enemy forces who weren’t\ncaught in the flames were forced to retreat back through the Oathgate. We\nhave a chance to …” He trailed off, looking around. “How did you kill this\nmany Fused?”\n“I didn’t,” Adolin whispered, pointing. They reached the culmination of\nthe carnage, a part of the silent battlefield nearest the broken gap in the\ndome. Inside, though the fires had gone out, flamespren danced on the\nstones, enjoying the heat.\nHe could see through the gap to the darkened center, where singers—\nwho could withstand more heat than humans—were reemerging. They’d fill\nthe dome before his forces could go in and face them. Still, Kushkam’s\nfirebombs had prevented complete disaster, forcing an important enemy\nretreat. They’d used most of the oil in the city, but it had worked.\nThe Fused who escaped before the flames should have been able to take\nthe city anyway.

Adolin could imagine enemy after enemy\nthrowing themselves at this location—he’d seen this kind of display before\nwith common troops trying to pull down a Shardbearer.\nAdolin had to stumble and crawl to climb that pile of corpses. At the top,\nthey found two bodies. Unarmored.\nTaln, the Herald, knelt here with his head back, speared with a dozen\nlances, which propped up his corpse—his hand still holding the crushed\nskull of a dead Fused. In death, he was covered in blood, his face tipped\ntoward the sky and his mouth open as if in a shout. Leaning against him\nfrom behind, nestled among the bodies as if looking for a place to rest, was\nAsh, a bloodied and chipped sword in her lap.\nShe was smiling. Bleeding from a good two dozen hits, she looked at\nAdolin, who knelt at the edge of the little crater at the top of the pile of\ncorpses.\n“This time,” she whispered, “I won’t let him go alone.”\nShe closed her eyes and fell still.\nAdolin gaped, awespren bursting around him in blue, as Colot arrived\nnearby—at last—with real reinforcements. He set them to guard the breach\nin the dome, though they had to stand back a little before the heat.\nCommon singers flooded the dome inside. And with them he saw Abidi\nthe Heavenly One. He and his troops seemed shaken, and didn’t engage\nColot’s reinforcements at the gap. The fire that had burned many—their\ncorpses still inside—would have them frightened.\nAdolin sat back, trying very hard to ignore both the corpses and the way\nhis leg fell impossibly, no foot or calf to brace it. Exhausted, drained,\nAdolin let himself close his eyes and breathe out a sigh.\nThey’d paid a terrible price, but the city would last another day.\nDalinar was at a parley.\nTwo armies, one human and one singer, were arrayed here to display\ntheir might—but Dalinar could tell they didn’t mean to do battle. The\npostures of the soldiers to his sides were, ironically, too aggressive. Their\nstances were more like poses, their weapons displayed prominently,\nparticularly their Shards. Plus, there were too few anticipationspren.\nA smaller group of people—including the Windrunner they’d followed\nvia Connection—was meeting in a small, open-sided pavilion between the\narmies. Discussing terms of surrender perhaps? Or negotiating a treaty?\nBeside him, Navani dropped the spear that had appeared in her hand as\nthey’d joined this vision. She lifted Gav, and a few people glanced at him,\nmuttering about the odd spren.\n“There’s going to be a fight soon,” Navani said. “Those ones in the\ncenter are deciding terms for the battle. We should get away from the front\nlines.”\n“Actually,” Dalinar said, “this is a parley for peace.”\n“Really?” she said, looking down the line of soldiers. “How can you\ntell?”\n“Instinct,” he said. “I’m going to put us into that group at the center.

All\nright?”\n“Do it.”\nHe thought about how many times he’d been in similar meetings, which\nmade a faint line of light Connect him to those having the discussions. With\nthat, he changed the perspective for him, Navani, and Gav; they appeared\nwith the parley group, inside the pavilion. Yes … people didn’t negotiate\nbattlefield rules with refreshments on hand. But terms of peace?\nThe table they stood around also supported this conclusion. It was\ncovered in maps that had been drawn on, scribbled out, circled, annotated.\nSeveral humans—both men and women—were in the process of writing on\nthose maps currently, though the writers all seemed to be this era’s version\nof ardents. At least they wore the familiar grey robes—though these bore\nodd embroidery—even if the hairstyles weren’t what Dalinar expected.\nThe Windrunner—looking closer, Dalinar now thought maybe he was\nRiran like Evi—stepped up to the table. He had more lines on his face now,\nand appeared much as Dalinar remembered him from the Feverstone Keep\nvision. He felt excited as he realized how close they were. He turned and\nscanned the room, noting Radiants of several orders, including—at the\nback, watching—Melishi, plus the Heralds Kalak and Nale.\nAcross the table from the humans were what should have been an\nimpossibility: Regal singers, in a variety of imposing forms, their eyes\nglowing faintly red in the canopied shade. This was the False Desolation,\nwhen the singers had gained forms of power without the intervention of\nOdium. Though many thought it just a story, this brutal, bloody war had\nended with the “Voidbringers” becoming simple parshmen.\nDalinar glanced at Navani, who frowned back at him. If this was one of\nthe most terrible times in history … why were they all chatting in a\npavilion? Were they about to witness the last breakdown of talks? Perhaps\nhe’d been too quick to assume there wouldn’t be a battle today.\n“Look,” the Windrunner—Navani had said his name was Garith—said.\n“We cannot promise you that land! As I told you, we don’t yet have an\nagreement from the kings who rule there.”\nDalinar eyed the maps, trying to judge the locations. It seemed … they\nwere near Iri. Is that where the singers live between Desolations? Surely\nthey couldn’t all fit in one kingdom, not if they had the strength of numbers\nto assault the entire world …\n“You could fight the kings of those regions,” said a direform Regal at the\nfront of the enemy contingent. Femalen, with a pattern of black and red that\nwas made up of large patches of each color. She had wickedly barbed\ncarapace and an intense stare. “Conquer the region, then expel the humans\nthere.”\n“I’m not going to fight my own people,” Garith said.\n“They’re not your people.”\n“All humans are my people. I’m Radiant.”\n“Our god will not accept a treaty,” the direform said, “without this land.\nOur people are tired of being herded into the mountains and unfertile"

        "text": "“All humans are my people. I’m Radiant.”\n“Our god will not accept a treaty,” the direform said, “without this land.\nOur people are tired of being herded into the mountains and unfertile\nregions. We must have more farmland.” Behind her, the others hummed to a\nsharp rhythm, indicating their agreement.\nGarith sat down at the table, causing the three ardents to stop writing.\nThe Radiant—who didn’t wear his armor, but instead a simple tunic—put\nhis hands to his head, sighing. “Do you want to return to the killing? You\nsaid your god was willing to listen and negotiate.”\n“For this land,” another one said from behind.\n“You have all of Moladetia,” Garith said, waving to the maps. “It\nincludes swaths of farmland, with perfect hills, around Eila. Isn’t that\nenough?”\n“No,” the singer said. “Our people in Silnaka cannot continue to survive\nin the highlands. We need not one singer kingdom, but three. Why are we\nconfined to mountains and one stretch of land? We must thrive.”\n“It’s always been enough before …” Garith said.\nThe singers just hummed to that, drawing angerspren. Finally, the\ndireform at the front spoke. “We are done for today.” She withdrew with the\nothers, leaving the pavilion. The enemy army beyond started to retreat,\nmoving in warpairs, as the listeners had once done—something he hadn’t\nseen in previous eras.\nSmaller numbers than modern militaries, Dalinar noted. Judging by\ncounts on the map … He’d always had a hunch that the numbers in old\nbattle reports, written by ancient scholars, were inflated. He couldn’t\nimagine hundreds of thousands of troops meeting on a battlefield in the\ndays before modern logistics.\nAfter the singers had withdrawn, Radiants began to pull seats over to the\ntable. Notably, Melishi—the Bondsmith—continued to watch from the rear.\nDid he know he stood with two Heralds, or did Nale and Kalak use aliases\nat this time?\nNavani and Gav waited quietly. Dalinar, however, pulled a seat over to\nthe table himself. He didn’t have time for quiet observation—according to\nhis clock, he had barely over two days until his meeting with Odium. He\nhad to find the answers to what had happened to Honor, and he was close.\n“Garith,” said a female Radiant with the colorings of an Edgedancer on\nher clothing, “it might be time to give this up. They won’t agree.”\n“They will,” Garith said. “They’re willing to talk. We merely have to\nfind the right path. Please. Give me more time.” He put one hand on the\ntable.\nDalinar leaned forward. He’d been in meetings like this, trying to\npersuade everyone to follow a course he knew was right. He was used to\nresistance. Complications. Yet here, one Radiant, then another, then a third\nput their hands out on top of Garith’s.\n“You’ve held us together,” one of them said. “I didn’t believe you could,\nbut you did it.”\n“We lost the tower, but we remained a people,” the Edgedancer said.\n“The Radiants support you.”"

        "text": "but you did it.”\n“We lost the tower, but we remained a people,” the Edgedancer said.\n“The Radiants support you.”\nDalinar hesitantly put his hand on top of the others. “They have their god\nthough,” he said, trying to work it into the conversation. “The aggression\nshe inspires worries me.”\n“Agreed,” said an Azish Stoneward as they pulled their hands back. “But\nthere is dissension among the singers because of it. That group that split off\n… we’ve been tracking them. They have abandoned all forms. They’d\nrather go without than bow to Mishram and the Unmade.”\n“They make a mistake,” Garith said. “She’s more reasonable than Odium\never was.”\n“You don’t know that,” the Edgedancer replied. “It’s been thousands of\nyears since anyone fought Odium.”\nGarith looked like he wanted to say something, but didn’t. Storms. He\nwas hiding something. Was he … was he meeting with the Unmade? In\nsecret?\nWas he a traitor?\n“I’d feel better,” Dalinar said tentatively, “if I knew more of what to\nexpect from our side. Regarding our god.”\n“Yes, well,” Garith said. “Honor won’t meet with anyone other than\nMelishi. So unless he’ll give us the gift of a little guidance for once …”\nAll eyes turned toward the Bondsmith. The man met the stares with a\nlevel one of his own. “Honor does not interfere any longer. Our doings are\nours alone.”\n“But you have spoken to him,” Garith said.\n“He does not interfere,” Melishi said, his arms folded.\nGarith sighed, looking back to the others sitting at the table. Ardents\nwere quietly rolling up maps, but otherwise there was silence. Except for a\ngentle wind.\nAre you there? Dalinar thought. Ancient god? Are you still watching?\nHe got … a feeling, but no words. The ancient gods—the Wind, the\nStone, the Night—had less power in this time. They found it difficult to\nspeak.\n“We are close to lasting peace,” Garith said, blue fronds of\nsincerityspren unfolding around him. “I promise you, we’re closer to a\ntreaty than we seem.”\n“They will betray it,” Melishi said. “They are the Voidbringers,\ndestroyers.”\n“And what are we?” Garith snapped. “We’re all Voidbringers. Every\ntime we pick up a spear or a Blade and slaughter someone over this cursed\nland, we become Voidbringers. Singer or human, it’s the same. That’s the\nVoid, Melishi.”\n“Watchers at the rim,” the Stoneward said. “Someone must fight.”\n“Yes,” Garith said, standing. “But we mustn’t love it so much we\nabandon other options. This treaty will work. It … it must … Just give me\ntime.”\n“You have it,” the Edgedancer said. “But we can’t keep at this forever.”\nGarith nodded, and the meeting began to disperse. Dalinar watched\nGarith walk from the pavilion, where he was joined by a small group of\nother Windrunners. He glanced back at the pavilion, then took to the sky\nwith his attendants.\nFollow … the Wind said."

He glanced back at the pavilion, then took to the sky\nwith his attendants.\nFollow … the Wind said.\nStorms. He didn’t have the powers to follow with Windrunning, but he\nhad to find out what they were up to.\n“Does anyone else worry about where he goes?” Dalinar asked the\nothers.\n“He’s always been like that,” the Edgedancer said. “But he’s led us well,\nNaze. You have to admit that.”\nThey began to break down the pavilion, and he saw Navani taking some\nof the notes from the ardents and scanning them. Dalinar felt a building\nsense of foreboding.\nIt was coming. The Recreance was here.\nHe jumped as someone stepped up beside him. Melishi.\n“Tonight is the night,” Melishi said. “We know where he’ll be. I hope it\nwon’t break the others when they realize Garith is a traitor.”\n“Tonight,” Dalinar said. “Where?”\n“About an hour’s walk from the keep,” Melishi said. “Same place as last\ntime, though we were too late. Tonight we’ll go early and watch. Your\nwarnings in the past have been useful, Naze, but this must be done.\nOtherwise, Garith will destroy us all. Are you in?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar whispered, and a line of light burst into existence tying\nhim to Melishi. He pulled on the line of light, and the setting warped around\nhim. In seconds he was lying prone on the stone ground, with Navani, Gav,\nMelishi, and several others—including Kalak.\nIt was night, first moon, and they hid in a hollow in the ground, near\nsome trees, their bodies camouflaged beneath branches and fallen leaves.\nThe landscape here was made up of many towering rock formations,\nreminding him of the place where the Heralds had abandoned their Blades.\nPerhaps this was the same region—with rocks like buildings, forming many\ncanyons, small trees lining a stream that ran past behind Dalinar.\nThe lofty rock formations in front of him—thirty or forty feet tall—\nsurrounded a kind of natural glade or clearing. He didn’t like this spot; he\nsaw too many places for people to get around you, sneak up without being\nseen. But perhaps it was a good space for a clandestine meeting, with\nshadows cast by moonlight.\nHe took Navani’s hand and mouthed “Sorry” to her in apology for doing\nthis so brashly. She nodded, and took Gav by the hand. He seemed to be\ndoing well, his head cocked as if he were listening to something. Storms, it\ncouldn’t actually be Elhokar, could it?\nLights in the sky. Windrunners, glowing with Stormlight, landed together\non the ground ahead, among the rocks. Dalinar leaned forward, and got a\nglare from Melishi, so he settled back again, not disturbing their cover.\nGarith paced the stone, looking worried. Storms, that posture … that\nconcern. This was a man working hard to hold too many things together, to\nkeep the threads from unraveling, to keep a people united."

This was a man working hard to hold too many things together, to\nkeep the threads from unraveling, to keep a people united.\nI’ve known that feeling, Dalinar thought idly. I’ve been that man. But\nwhy meet with the enemy to—\nA moment later, Dalinar had shifted places. Quick as an eyeblink, he was\nin Garith’s place in the vision.\nDamnation. He’d empathized too strongly with the man’s plight, and had\naccidentally activated his powers. Panicked, he looked around, trying to\nspot Navani—but the place where she and the others lay was well hidden.\nAll he saw was a blanket of fallen leaves. Next to him, the other\nWindrunners shifted, one glancing at the moon, checking the time.\n“Garith,” one said, “are you sure about this?”\nBefore Dalinar could reply, the sound of footsteps on stone drew their\nattention. A group of three singers emerged from the shadows. So, Garith\nwas meeting with them in secret, and Melishi wanted proof of this,\nperhaps? Dalinar narrowed his eyes, but tried not to be aggressive or out of\ncharacter. Garith, whose place he had taken, had arranged this. Dalinar\nneeded to play along.\nThe direform femalen from the meeting stalked up to Garith, her figure\n—like those of all direforms—covered in sharp barbs of carapace. While\nthe other Windrunners backed away, Dalinar stood his ground. She came\nright up to him, standing a few inches taller than he was. She studied him,\nand her expression softened—her humming changing to a comforting\nrhythm.\nThen she bent forward, took Dalinar’s head in her hands, and kissed him.\nI offer my most sincere apology for everything wrong I’ve done. I\nam glad we tried. I am sorry that I continue to be someone with\nwhom a relationship is nearly impossible.\nKaladin found himself at peace as he laid out his tools to make dinner.\nTwilight had arrived on the seventh day.\nHe’d already acknowledged he wouldn’t make it back in time to see the\ncontest. Now though, he felt that truth rather than merely admitting it.\nWith this came peace. For despite it all—everything he’d been through,\nthe state he’d ended up in, the trauma he’d endured—a part of him had still\nassumed that he would become the champion Dalinar required. He’d\nbelieved, deep down, that he would return to Urithiru with the secrets of the\nHeralds—maybe even with Ishar—and save the day. Fight Odium’s\nchampion. Win.\nHe left his vegetables set out on a cloth by the fire. Then took a long\nbreath and lay on the hillside to look up at the stars. He and the others—\nafter flying and walking all day—were near the Dustbringer monastery.\nIt was never going to be me, he thought. It was always going to be\nDalinar himself. I knew that. He reached over and pulled a rolled bundle\nfrom his pack. The cloak Dalinar had given him. It made for a nice pillow\nas he stared at the stars. After a short time, he got out his flute. Dinner could\nwait."

        "text": "from his pack. The cloak Dalinar had given him. It made for a nice pillow\nas he stared at the stars. After a short time, he got out his flute. Dinner could\nwait.\nHe relaxed there and played it slowly. Because he enjoyed the art of it,\nand he thought that manifested in his notes.\nIn the sky above, his armor spren swirled about in patterns to the music.\nSyl eventually flew over, full sized, and lay down next to him, glowing\nsoftly, staring into the sky as he played. He wasn’t certain how long they\nremained there, because the softness of the grass seemed to invade his very\nbeing. Soft sound. Soft, fuzzy minutes. Soft ideas, offering quiet, pleasant\ncompanionship. Soft company.\nHe let the music trail off eventually and held the flute up, looking at it\nagainst the backdrop of stars. “Still no echoing music coming back to me.”\n“You should be honored then,” Syl said. She rolled closer to him—\nleaving her hair frazzled. “The Wind likes your songs, Kaladin. She carries\nthem away to cherish.”\nHe smiled, flipping the flute in his hand, like doing a miniature kata.\n“I can’t believe how good you’ve become,” she said.\n“I’m not good. I’m merely not awful.”\n“After only seven days!”\n“I only know one song, and that barely.”\n“One song, in seven days.” She poked him. “And it’s a beautiful one that\nreminds me of the song of Roshar itself. Just let me compliment you, all\nright?”\n“All right,” he said. Then he went back to playing. He played for the\npeople he’d lost, to remember them. The songs felt more real as he thought\nabout those people. Goshel, Dallet, Tien, Nalma, Teft, Maps, and a dozen\nother members of Bridge Four. Men of his squads alongside slaves whose\nfaces he’d almost forgotten, but whose companionship he would always\ntreasure.\nHe worried that more of his friends might have died during this most\nrecent fighting, though the spanreed had given no relevant news tonight. He\nplayed for them as well. A melancholy song, but not a painful one. With the\nsong’s help, he felt … felt he could remember the fallen—but remarkably,\nnot feel their loss was his fault.\nNale ruined the moment by stomping past. “I hate that song,” he said.\n“Why?” Kaladin asked.\nNale didn’t reply. He tore into a pack and fished out a ration bar.\n“Nale?” Kaladin called as he stomped past again. “Do Heralds eat?”\n“Heralds can eat,” he said. “We hunger if we do not. These bodies of\nours are highly Invested, but they are not immortal; only our souls are\nimmortal.” He turned to Kaladin, holding up the Soulcast ration bar. “This\nis a perfect food.”\n“Those taste like rancid armor grease.”\n“They provide sustenance, are portable, and do not distract. Soulcast\njerky, congealed fats, dried nutrients.” He ate it, no expression on his face.\n“A soldier needs nothing more.”\nWhatever. This wasn’t a point Kaladin wanted to argue. Nale strode off,"

Nale strode off,\nthough as he did, Kaladin found Szeth settled on a rock nearby. Watching.\n“What?” Kaladin said.\n“I’m waiting,” Szeth said softly, “for some stew.”\nWell, storms. Kaladin considered the deliberate way Szeth had said that,\nafter hearing Nale proclaim the virtues of ration bars. Then Kaladin\nhurriedly got to work. Boiling water in his small pot, slicing vegetables,\ndropping them in.\nKaladin wanted to prompt Szeth to speak. But something … something\nseemed to whisper to him in Wit’s voice. This isn’t the part where you talk.\nJust listen …\n“I am caught between two choices,” Szeth said. “I can see the merits of\nboth.”\nKaladin nodded, and kept chopping.\n“Yesterday, I did as Nale demanded,” Szeth continued. “I went in to kill,\nand won the day, but only with Syl’s help. Moss was a friend once. Now he\nis another corpse I must carry.”\nKaladin nodded again.\n“I hate this,” Szeth said, “but I have made promises. Oaths. I am doing\ngood for this land; I can feel it. I should carry on, regardless of the cost to\nme.”\nKaladin finished cutting his longroots. Then he played the flute while the\nstew simmered, because Szeth asked him to, and because it annoyed Nale.\nSzeth stayed, even when Nale came over to glower. The Herald retreated\nagain when Kaladin handed Szeth a bowl, and some of the man’s pain\nappeared to melt off his face as he ate.\nBetween bites, Szeth said, “I would … welcome your thoughts, Kaladin\nStormblessed.”\nThe mythical power of stew. Kaladin smiled, taking a bite, and realized\nsomething. Back in Hearthstone as a child, he had yearned to train in the\nspear and learn how to fight. Yet the best moments of his life, and the most\nimportant connections he’d made, hadn’t come from his training in the\nspear. They had come from a different kind of training. Done by his mother\nduring those same early years—when she taught him to peel longroots and\nboil vegetables. Remarkable.\nWhat would Wit tell him to do here with Szeth? Tell a story, maybe.\nKaladin didn’t know any good ones, except the ones of his life.\n“I knew this man once,” Kaladin said. “Goshel. He was a slave with me,\nduring some of the darkest days of my life. They wanted me to train them\nso they could revolt against their masters. They’d found out I’d been a\nfighting man.”\n“Yes,” Szeth said, thoughtful. “Slavery is nasty and barbaric. I would\nhave fought back too.”\nKaladin looked up, surprised. “But … I thought … I mean, you served\nfor so long.”\n“I oathed myself into my position,” Szeth said. “You were forced into it,\nweren’t you? Betrayed?”\nKaladin put his fingers to his forehead, touching only the smooth skin"

Betrayed?”\nKaladin put his fingers to his forehead, touching only the smooth skin\nwhere his tattoo was. No more scars. No more brands. Dangerous no\nlonger? “Yes,” he said.\n“That is a different thing entirely,” Szeth said.\n“Rebellion was against the law, regardless of our reason for becoming\nslaves.”\nSzeth grunted, then turned back to his stew.\nThis wasn’t the way Wit told stories. Kaladin felt awkward as he\ncontinued without feathered words. “So, Goshel. He was a smaller fellow,\nSzeth. You’d have liked him. Quiet. Determined. He served with precision,\nbut had this fire in his eyes. Like smoldering coals. He asked me to teach\nthe others to fight. Thing is, he already knew. I saw it the moment he held a\nspear—though he tried to hide it. This floored me. I hadn’t met many other\nslaves who had been soldiers.”\nSzeth grunted. “Too valuable?”\n“Exactly,” Kaladin said. “It takes a lot to force a trained soldier into\ncommon household slavery. Something unusual has to happen.”\nSzeth paused, spoon halfway to his lips, waiting. Huh. It worked, even\nwithout the feathered words.\n“And?” Szeth asked.\n“Goshel was worse than a deserter,” Kaladin said. “When I got his story\nout of him, I found a man who had deliberately disobeyed orders. He’d\nkilled his commanding officer.”\n“That monster,” Szeth whispered.\nKaladin hesitated, because he hadn’t expected such a willing audience in\nSzeth. Yet the man watched him, eyes wide. Even for him.\nHe hasn’t had years to get used to Wit, Kaladin thought. Or maybe he\njust isn’t as cynical as I am. Probably the latter. Kaladin had always found\nhimself thinking more about why Wit was telling him the story, as opposed\nto just listening.\n“There’s a monster in this story,” Kaladin said. “Goshel’s commanding\nofficer ordered him to burn a village.”\nSzeth hesitated, then continued eating. “Ah.”\n“Ah?” Kaladin asked.\n“I see why you tell me this story,” Szeth said. “You want me to think\nabout the kinds of commands a soldier must disobey.”\nMaybe they weren’t so different. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to be that heavy-\nhanded. But … Szeth, it’s true.” Kaladin served himself a bowl. “Goshel\ndied in the rebellion I started. I blamed myself for quite a long time.”\n“You blamed yourself for surviving, didn’t you?”\nKaladin nodded.\n“It hurts to live,” Szeth said, with a nod, “when you don’t deserve it. So\n… you want me to disobey my orders, my oaths?”\n“I want you to consider giving something different a go,” Kaladin said.\n“You’ve tried what Nale wants of you.” He took a bite of the stew and …\nstorms, it really was good this time, wasn’t it? “How is that working? For\nyou. Your emotions. Your thoughts.”\n“Not well,” Szeth whispered."

Your thoughts.”\n“Not well,” Szeth whispered.\n“Think about that,” Kaladin said. “I don’t know if we’ll be able to get\nout of this without more killing, but we can try. I’ll help you.”\nSzeth served himself a second bowl. “I will consider.” He walked away,\nwatching the sky and eating as he strolled.\nStrangely, a part of Kaladin panicked as Szeth walked away. Despite\nseeing how well the conversation had gone, Kaladin wanted to do more. In\na way, Szeth’s positive response made it worse—because the part of\nKaladin that had always needed to help was stronger for people he liked.\nHe felt a sudden powerful urge to leap from his seat, to run after the man\nand insist that they make a plan. Or worse, to make one without Szeth’s\nknowledge. To protect him, save him, fight for him, do anything to keep the\nman from being hurt. He remembered a dead girl on a slab—a child he and\nhis father had failed to save. A terrible pain echoed from that distant failure.\nNo.\nHis instinct was good. It had led him to save Bridge Four, and himself.\nBut he could now view it with more mature eyes. It was also dangerous, the\nsame way water could still drown a dehydrated man. Storms. If he let this\nneed to protect control him completely, he would never be able to help\nanyone. He’d break first. And so, carefully, he fought back.\nSzeth deserves to make his own choices, he thought. If I step in, I take\nthat from him—and that’s not who I want to be.\nIf I don’t control myself, I can’t protect, can’t help. If I let what Tien’s\ndeath did to me happen again and again, I will break. I can’t keep a\nstranglehold on those I love.\nAnd finally, most potent of all: I have to live for myself. Let him go for\nnow.\nThere was a place for both Kaladin and Stormblessed. It wasn’t so easy\nto do as to think it, of course. But today Kaladin’s anxiety retreated,\nparticularly as he remembered the music. The calming, peaceful love of the\nsong he’d played, and its rhythms. Nothing magical. Merely a … contrast.\n“Did something just change?” Syl said, sitting next to him on the log. “In\nour bond?”\n“I don’t know,” Kaladin said. “I don’t feel any different.”\n“I feel … warmth and peace,” Syl said, leaning against his shoulder, her\nhair blowing softly and tickling his cheek. “That was well done with\nSzeth.”\n“Wit would have done better.”\n“Wit would have gotten himself stabbed.”\n“Maybe,” Kaladin said, taking another bite. “Wish you could taste this\nstew. It’s kind of not terrible.”\nShe opened her mouth to say something, but was interrupted as a\nshimmering figure appeared by the fire. The shape of a man wearing a\nuniform—but really a black void filled with stars. Kaladin hadn’t been\naware highspren could appear that way on this side."

Um … please?”\n“You want help?” Syl said. “You’re a highspren!”\nThe figure slumped forward. “Can I admit,” he said softly, “that I’m not\na very good one?”\nKaladin and Syl shared a look.\n“I know how it’s supposed to go,” the figure continued. “The others\nshowed me. Speak like this! Commanding voice! Get the human to do what\nyou say! But it feels so wrong. I see him hurting … and it feels wrong.”\n“Is this your first time as a bonded spren?” Kaladin asked. Syl was\nglaring. She had a thing about highspren.\n“Yeah,” the spren said. “We’re supposed to take the oaths, you know?\nWe’re the only order where the spren take the oaths too. But I feel like I’m\nruining everything for everyone. I don’t feel like I’m helping, but I’m also\nmaking them all disappointed!”\n“Them?” Kaladin asked.\n“The other highspren. Particularly 121.”\n“Who?” Kaladin asked.\n“Nale’s spren,” Syl whispered. “He’s one of the worst.”\n“Your names are numbers?” Kaladin asked, frowning. “Like …\nCryptics?”\n“What?” both she and the highspren said.\n“It’s nothing like that,” the highspren replied. “Theirs are formulas. Ours\nare numbers.”\n“That was honestly kind of racist,” Syl whispered to Kaladin.\n“I’m sorry?” Kaladin said, rubbing his forehead. “No, I really am. I just\ndon’t know much about this. So … your name is …?”\n“12124,” 12124 said.\n“Is that how many of you there have been?”\n“No. It’s just my name.”\nSyl rolled her eyes, as if Kaladin had said something awkward again.\n“So, 12124,” Kaladin said, “you’re on your first mission as a bonded\nspren, and you’re trying to help Szeth—but also to fulfill your order’s\nexpectations of you.”\n“Yes!” 12124 said. “But then you said we don’t have to be what we are,\nyou know? You said you’re an anarchist!”\n“I did not say I’m an anarchist,” Kaladin said. “I’m simply reminding\npeople that they have choices.”\n12124 leapt to his feet and started pacing, and it was somewhat hard to\nfollow him in the darkness, where his shape bled into the night.

Curiously,\nthey stayed stationary as he moved—as if he were a portal.\n“Rule one, I’m not a thing,” 12124 said. “Rule two, I get to choose.”\n“Rule three …” Syl whispered.\nThe highspren stopped. “I deserve to be happy.” He turned to regard\nthem. “What if being happy means … doing things differently from other\nspren?”\n“You’ll have to decide,” Kaladin said, getting another spoonful of stew.\n“You’re supposed to give me the answers!”\n“You wanted my therapy,” Kaladin said. “This is how it goes. I don’t\ngive answers. I just …”\n… give questions to think upon?\nDamnation.\nWit, you crafty bastard.\n“You just what?” 12124 asked.\n“I just listen,” Kaladin said.\n“That doesn’t sound like much work,” 12124 said, folding his arms.\n“Maybe I should have joined the dissenters.”\n“The what?” Kaladin said.\nThe spren looked away. “I … shouldn’t have said that. Pretend I didn’t.\nAnd please, give me at least some advice.”\n“Maybe,” Kaladin said, “if what you’re doing isn’t working, you should\ntry something different. Talk to Szeth and see what he wants. His opinion\nshould be relevant. And … try not to be too hard on yourself, 12124. This is\nyour first time. You’ll make mistakes. Forgive yourself for them, then do\nbetter.”\n“You haven’t told me if I should follow the will of the highspren,” 12124\nsaid, “or if I should follow my heart.”\n“I haven’t,” Kaladin agreed, taking another bite.\n“This ‘therapy’ is too easy,” the spren said. “All you do is sit and listen,\nthen tell me things I already kind of know.”\n“Remarkable,” Kaladin said, “how little we do things like that though,\nisn’t it?”\nThe spren didn’t have a face, only a void of stars, but he seemed to be\nsmiling as he replied. “It is remarkable. More so because I actually feel\nbetter.”\nKaladin raised a spoon to him, and 12124 vanished.\n“That was so weird,” Syl said, leaning in and whispering to Kaladin,\nwatching the space where 12124 had been.\n“Do you know anything about the dissenters he mentions?”\n“No,” she said. “But I don’t know a lot about spren politics of this era.”\nShe hesitated. “How odd. I find myself almost not loathing him.”\n“Must be the stew.”\n“I didn’t eat the stew.”\n“Then imagine how much better things would be if you had.” He smiled\nand took another bite.\n“Is that supposed to sound wise or something?” she said. “Because it\nwas just confusing.”\n“Sorry,” he said. “Wit always ends conversations with comments like\nthat. I don’t think I have the hang of it yet.” He finished his stew, then\nconsidered a moment.\nThen he prepared another bowl and went looking for Nale.

He found the\nHerald hovering in the sky maybe fifty feet up, cross-legged, eyes closed.\nKaladin dithered.\n“What?” Syl said, walking up beside him.\n“I was going to try to give this to Nale,” Kaladin said, “but I feel …\nstorms, Syl, I feel he doesn’t deserve it. I don’t want to help him.”\n“You didn’t want to help Szeth at the start either.”\n“This is different,” Kaladin said. “He …”\nHe is your enemy, the Wind said in Kaladin’s ear. He jumped, then\nrelaxed as he recognized her voice. Rather, he has become your enemy.\n“Wind,” Syl said, “why does Nale hate the song Kaladin plays?”\nHe hates it because he remembers it, the Wind explained. Cephandrius—\nyou call him Wit—taught you that song, Kaladin, because it is one of our\nrhythms. It is the song the Heralds heard, that Nale heard, that brought\nthem here to safety.\n“But why should he hate that?”\nA part of him wishes they’d died on Ashyn and never come to Roshar.\nThe Wind’s touch brushed his face. And another part remembers who he\nused to be. Thank you, Kaladin, for that song. It strengthens me. But … I’m\nsorry. I need more from you.\n“For what?” Kaladin whispered, turning away from Nale. “I came here\nin part because of what you said.”\nYou need to help them. The Heralds.\n“I …” Kaladin swallowed, standing there in the dark night, surrounded\nby living wind. “I think they should probably die, ancient god. They have\nlived too long.”\nThey are the last pieces of Honor, Kaladin. Siphoned off, held apart.\nThey are more important than you can know.\n“But why not let them rest? Haven’t they earned that?”\nWould it have been right to let you rest? You acknowledged in a column\nof light what you had done wrong. Would it have been better to not let you\nchange, not let you grow?\nThat day, less than two weeks past, seemed like so long ago. That day\nwhen Kaladin had put down his burdens in the proper way, by forgiving\nhimself.\n“No,” he admitted. “It would have been wrong to let me go before I did\nthat.”\nIf they die now, they die as they are. But their journey is not complete,\nKaladin. Neither is yours. You … regret coming here, to this land?\n“I wanted to be the champion,” he admitted. “And protect Alethkar.”\nYour duty here is far more important. I need a champion too. All of the\nspren will need one.\n“As you said before,” Syl said. “How?”\nThe Heralds are Connected to Honor, the Wind said. In a way that once\ngave them power over Odium, they can also have power over Honor. And\nall his creations. To bind them.\n“But why,” Kaladin said, with a chill, “would we need that kind of\npower?”\nI see … danger … the Wind said. Please, Kaladin. I love him, as I love"

That is something the Stormfather does, but not something\nI have done in a long, long time …\nHe felt a gust of wind in his face, and was given … the faintest\nimpression. Not a vision, but a hint of a memory. Several, in sequence.\nDarkness, followed by light as Nale—covered in ash and blood from his\nown cuts—pulled rubble aside and reached a hand to those trapped within.\nTerror, cowering in a corner, as red eyes burst through a doorway—then\nNale, moving with the speed of the wind, arrived to save those who had\nbeen forgotten.\nGratitude, looking past a man in black, tall, bleeding from one hand\nwhile he held a glittering Shardblade in the other. Wounded, but his stance\nsaying as loud as any banner: You WILL NOT have them.\nA dozen flashes in a row, each a fragment of something someone had\nseen and felt—taken by the Wind, then passed to Kaladin like a distant\nscent.

Kaladin breathed in deeply, the knowledge and\nmemories settling on him.\nSyl took his hand.\n“Did you see them too?” Kaladin whispered.\nShe nodded.\nHe wanted to ponder it further, maybe bring that stew to Nale, but Szeth\ncame dashing up. Even before he arrived, Kaladin went alert—tossing the\nbowl and summoning the Sylspear.\n“Look,” Szeth said, taking him by the arm. “Look.”\nSzeth pointed in the same direction Nale was staring. Northeast. The\ndirection of the final monasteries. Dustbringer, Skybreaker, Windrunner—\nwhich they’d skip—and Bondsmith.\nA stream of glowing light in the sky ran in that direction. Like stars,\nmoving, a shining river of light. Low on the horizon, easy to miss at first,\nbut obvious now that it had been pointed out.\n“What is it?” Kaladin whispered.\n“Spren,” Syl said. “All of the spren of this land. No wonder we haven’t\nseen any.”\n“They are always more rare here,” Szeth said. “But not as rare as they\nhave been during this trip.”\nA shadow descended. Nale, coming to alight on the ground beside them.\n“Your gods have gathered to witness your decisions, Szeth-son-Neturo. And\nthe salvation of this land.”\nKaladin pried for more information, but of course Nale wouldn’t give\nany. It seemed that if there were to be answers, they would be found to the\nnortheast.

Certainly, she never wanted to go\nback to her childhood.\nYou’ll need to, Veil warned. We haven’t finished that fight yet.\nShallan wanted to ignore the comment, but to do so risked Formless. So\nshe acknowledged it. She would go back. There were things she needed to\nconfront. Fortunately, she didn’t need to do it right now.\nShe had Glys and Tumi create a scene in Shadesmar for them, an\nobsidian rock ledge where she and Adolin had seen a starspren. That trip\nhad been a time of darkness, but this had been a point of light. More and\nmore, she was trying to let the points of light—not the darkness between\nthem—guide her.\nToday, after Renarin and Rlain stepped into the vision with her, Shallan\nwalked along this ridge, smiling up at the dancing starspren: flowing,\nwinged, long and sinuous. Like a chasmfiend, but more regal. Pattern put a\nlong-fingered hand on her shoulder, and she put her hand on his. Testament\nsat to the side, on a slightly higher section of stone.\n“What happened here?” Renarin said. “Why is it so much better than one\nof our childhood homes?”\nWouldn’t you like to know, Shallan thought, turning to look at the two of\nthem, who settled down suspiciously close to one another on an obsidian\noutcropping. Shallan remembered those days too, with fondness. The early\ndays when she realized that the relationship with Adolin was going to work.\nThe euphoria of love—and of relief that she hadn’t somehow screwed it up.\nBe safe, she thought to him. Please.\n“Renarin,” she said, refocusing on their mission, “you told me that you\nspoke to Mishram again?”\n“I did,” he said. “I … well, I kind of confronted her. May have …\nantagonized her by demanding she explain herself.”\n“Really?” Rlain said to an appreciative rhythm. “You confronted one of\nthe Unmade? Made demands of her?”\n“She’s locked away,” Renarin said. “It’s not so brave as you make it\nsound.”\n“Her prison is obviously failing. I’m impressed.”\n“What did Mishram say exactly, Renarin?” Shallan asked. “I think the\nwording might be relevant.”\n“She said, ‘I showed you so you can find me. So I may destroy you.’”\nRlain’s rhythm became more uncomfortable. “She hates you because\nyou’re human—and me because my people betrayed her.” He paused. “Still,\nshe is willing to lead us to her …”\n“To kill us!” Renarin said.\n“Renarin,” Rlain replied, “I think we need to find her. We came here to\nstop the Ghostbloods, but we—even Shallan, with all her skill—have\nproven insufficient.”\n“He’s right,” Shallan noted. “I caught a glimpse of Mraize a few visions\nago, but that’s it. I don’t think we’re good enough to track them in here.”\n“So …” Rlain said, his rhythm determined, “we need to find the prison"

I don’t think we’re good enough to track them in here.”\n“So …” Rlain said, his rhythm determined, “we need to find the prison\nand move it—before they do.”\n“I … figured you’d want that,” Renarin said. He took a deep breath. “I\njust worry. The way she acts, the way she talks … And Glys told me that\nshe’s influenced the visions we’re seeing.”\n“Maybe there’s a clue in them,” Shallan said. “Like how she’s been\nshowing us her face in objects. Anyone remember seeing anything odd in\nrecent visions?”\n“I was too busy feeling rejected,” Rlain said. “It was a hard memory, that\none. I had to sit and listen to my friends realize that we needed a spy. They\nsettled on me because I was the most disposable.”\n“I was in the palace at Kholinar,” Renarin said. “It was also a hard\nvision, but not as fresh a wound. I was being bullied by some other teens,\nand Adolin saved me.” He frowned. “The thing is, I’ve grown since that\nday. I didn’t want that protection anymore; I wanted to defend myself, to be\nmy own person, not Adolin Kholin’s little invalid brother.”\n“And did you see anything out of the ordinary?” Shallan asked.\n“I’m trying to remember,” Renarin said. “Honestly, I can’t think of\nanything that stands out. Other than the entire experience feeling wrong\nnow, as that’s not who I am anymore.”\nIt was the same for her, unfortunately. Maybe there was a clue in her\nvision of telling stories to her brothers, but she didn’t see it. She paced\nwhile above the starspren posed for her, lounging, looking down.\nHer vision … She’d sought refuge with her brothers. Brought them joy.\nIt was a painful memory, but a fond one all the same. The beginnings, she\nthought, of what had made of her an actor—and a Lightweaver.\nShallan, Veil said, confront it.\nAt her side, Pattern began humming. Hesitantly, Testament joined in\nfrom her seat nearby.\n“I changed my vision,” Shallan said to Rlain and Renarin. “I was going\nto see something else, but I refused.”\n“And … what were you going to see?” Renarin asked.\n“The day I killed my mother,” Shallan said softly. “Perhaps Mishram\nintended to put some kind of clue in there. If so, I missed the chance.”\nThe two shared looks. Renarin shrugged; Rlain hummed. Then Renarin\nsat upright.\n“You remember something?” Shallan asked, eager.\n“No,” Renarin said. “It’s Glys. He says something has happened. My\nfather and aunt … they’ve found their way to an important moment, the one\nwhen Mishram was originally captured.”\nStorms. “That’s close to when Honor died, right?” Shallan said. “They’re\nconnected.”\nRenarin nodded. “It’s all linked. Including why Odium is afraid of\nMishram.”\n“Because she could kill him,” Shallan said. “And take his place. She’s a\nviable rival for his power.”\n“Exactly,” Renarin said.\nWait.\nWait."

She’s a\nviable rival for his power.”\n“Exactly,” Renarin said.\nWait.\nWait.\nBecause … she could kill him … As Shallan had told Mraize, she knew\nthat feeling: the danger a child presented to the parent. Before she could\nfollow the thought, Renarin stood. “We need to join my father’s vision.”\n“Mraize and Iyatil will be there,” she warned. “So be alert.”\n“Understood,” Renarin said. Storms, when had he grown that confident?\nHe reminded her of … well, his father. “Get ready. I’m going to have Glys\nsend us in.”\nGoodbye. It might be a great long time before we see one another\nagain, if ever.\nDalinar allowed himself to be kissed by the Regal.\nHe had never known of a singer to display affection in such a human\nway, but the kiss was genuine, and drew passionspren. It took an effort for\nDalinar not to pull back, as he felt he was going to get knifed at any\nmoment, yet this had to play out. He did hear a gasp from the spot where\nthe others were hiding, likely from Navani, and he hoped that everyone else\nwas too stunned to be suspicious.\nThe Regal finished her kiss and pulled back a little, her face still inches\nfrom his, eyes glowing faintly red. Her features, with that red and black\nmarbling—so alien, so terrible. This was his enemy. This was …\nConcern? She seemed concerned. Perhaps because he hadn’t responded\nto the kiss with the affection she anticipated.\n“Are you all right?” she whispered. “Is it the others? You said we should\nshow them.”\n“It’s fine,” Dalinar said, resting his hand on her shoulder.\nShe hummed gratefully and nodded in an exaggerated way—for him, he\nrealized. Storms … she legitimately cared. And when she looked to the\nother Windrunners, she offered them a smile—again exaggerated, but\ngenuine. Singers did smile, they just tended to be less dramatic about it than\nhumans.\nThis is not a betrayal, Dalinar thought. I don’t know what it is, but it’s\nnot a betrayal.\n“Do you want to do it?” she asked him. “Or shall I?”\n“Go ahead,” he said.\nShe stood close to him, so he—feeling it was the right thing to do—put\nhis arm around her. It was strange, doing that to someone who was taller\nthan he was, and he had to be careful of the ridges and sharp portions of her\ncarapace. He felt a moment of discomfort and betrayal himself, for Navani’s\nsake. He knew that she would understand, but few people would enjoy\nseeing their spouse in the arms of another.\n“You are Garith’s dearest friends,” the singer said to the Windrunners.\n“We’ve decided we need to explain. We started meeting in secret years ago,\nafter clashing on the battlefield …”\nShe glanced to him, and hummed softly.\n“We were enemies at first,” he said, guessing what to say next.\n“But we had one thing in common,” she said. “We both wanted all of"

Same as us.”\nIt was harder to say than it should have been. They’d stolen his\nhomeland, killed his brother. They’d assaulted the tower.\nBut … he’d attacked Herdaz in his youth, yet the Mink worked with\nhim. His people had fought the Vedens for centuries, and now one was his\ndaughter-in-law. Maybe there was something he could learn from this\nancient Windrunner.\nBut why did this all turn out so poorly …?\nA mounting dread began to build within him. He was not watching a\nvision that ended with a happy truce between peoples. This ended in slavery\nand broken oaths.\n“I can accept,” said one of the other Windrunners, “that a few of the\nsingers are willing to make peace. But the entire nation?”\n“Garith,” said another, “you’re barely holding the Radiants together. And\nshe argues so forcefully at our parleys!”\n“My people don’t want war,” said the singer at his side. “But … more of\nthem are aggressive than I’d prefer. I can’t look like I’m giving in. Garith\nand I wanted to show you, so you’d understand. Peace is possible. We can\nfind a way.”\n“Peace is possible,” Dalinar whispered.\nThe singer glanced at him, then nodded. “She agreed to come.”\n“… She?” Dalinar said.\n“These need to know it’s not just a few of us,” the singer said. “They\nneed to know our new god is different.”\nThe hair on Dalinar’s arms went up as something changed. He turned to\nsee that—among the shadows of the rising stones—a darkness had pooled.\nLiquid night. From it, into the light of the moon, stepped a figure.\nIt was in the shape of a singer. Shorter than most. No barbed carapace.\nNo dangerous expression. An adult with alternating lines of white, red, and\nblack. This was a spren though. Her bare feet didn’t touch the ground. Her\nhairstrands drifted unnaturally, lifted by some unseen wind. And she\nemitted the faintest glow, a violet red that was only really visible if you\nlooked at the ground beneath her, where it reflected faintly.\nThe singer next to him, and the three who accompanied her, bowed their\nheads and hummed to a reverent rhythm. Could this truly be her? Ba-Ado-\nMishram, the most terrible Unmade? Looking … like an average singer?\nAs she stepped forward, she jolted, and her figure—in a blink—was\nglaring at him with wide eyes, mouth open as if screaming. It passed just as\nquickly.

It was like … like a second Mishram was trying to break out of\nthis one. But as she stepped up to him, she stabilized into the kindly\nversion.\n“Garith,” she said, her voice overlapping somehow with multiple\nrhythms at once. “I have come, as you have vowed your sincerity.” She\nlooked to the other Windrunners. “I was skeptical, but if these two can find\npeace, then perhaps others can as well. I did not become their god to watch\nthem die. I …” She trailed off, and her demeanor changed. She jolted again,\na screaming figure replacing her for a moment, then she was back. Staring\n…\nStraight at where Navani’s group was hiding.\nRun, Mishram! Dalinar thought. Hide!\nBut he needed to see. This was why he was here.\n“Who else did you bring?” Mishram asked, pointing. “Who is out\nthere?”\nThe Windrunners turned, displaying obvious shock, as some of those\nwho had been hiding emerged. Navani was there, appearing concerned as\nshe held Gav’s hand. Kalak, at the rear, looked ashamed. No sign of\nMelishi. Dalinar turned, inspecting the region. That ridge there … a\nflanking maneuver would …\nHe spotted Melishi slipping out from between two stones nearby. The\nman had backed out of the woods and rounded behind Mishram, and was\nnow only ten feet away. Melishi carried a large gemstone, and as Mishram\nnoticed him, she cocked her head—but didn’t seem frightened.\nFabrials as we know them, Dalinar realized, haven’t been invented yet.\nHumans only barely learned to trap spren—and Mishram has no idea what\nthat stone can do.\n“I,” Melishi said, “am the Bondsmith.”\n“Yes,” Mishram said. “The one who abandoned the tower.”\nMelishi stepped closer, his robes rustling, that gemstone—big as a\nchild’s head—clutched before him in a two-handed grip. Largely uninfused,\nit glowed a soft yellow.\nThe singer at Dalinar’s side—he still didn’t know her name—grabbed\nhis hand. “The Bondsmith? If he joins with our cause … if he believes …\nthis could be the moment when we find lasting peace!”\nStorms. None of them realized they were witnessing an assassination.\nDalinar’s instincts screamed at him to do something, but he held back.\nRooted. A stone, like the watching monoliths.\nHe had been on enough battlefields to know what was coming. He could\nhave listed off the beats. Melishi getting even closer. Ba-Ado-Mishram\nwatching like a lone soldier, uncertain if she should stand her ground or run.\n“You’re trying to unite them,” Melishi said. “All of the singers … unite\nthem to follow you.”\n“I bring them harmony,” Mishram said. Speaking with rhythms in an\ninhuman way—and yet there was a vulnerability. “Odium would burn them,\nso I made my play, infusing myself with the full power of his\nperpendicularity.

I can replace\nhim.”\nMelishi stopped right before her. “And we can have peace. Two peoples.\nOne world.”\n“Yes,” Mishram said. “Peace.”\n“In that we are united,” said Melishi. “I know how to be certain we will\nhave peace. All you have to do is open your heart, and trust. I will unite us\nall.”\nThose words struck Dalinar through like a spear. Standing with a singer\nlover at his side, he forced himself to watch as the honor of an entire people\nwas broken in an instant. Melishi raised the gemstone to the unsuspecting\nspren, and …\nHesitated.\nMishram cocked her head.\nDalinar’s breath caught.\n“D , M ,” Honor’s voice said, vibrating through the small hollow\nO IT ELISHI\nof stone.\nMelishi did. Dalinar wasn’t certain of the mechanics, though he’d done it\nonce with the Thrill. Something about a deep Connection to the Unmade,\nwhich Melishi had forged with ideas of unity. Something about welcoming\nthem in, then continuing to pull.\nIn this case, Mishram’s desire to stop the war bound her to the\nBondsmith, who wanted exactly the same thing—but was willing to do an\nunspeakable act to make it happen. The Bondsmith began to glow, and\nMishram distorted and bent, screaming with a sudden raw panic. A hundred\noverlapping voices, and a tunnel of light.\nDalinar sent himself away, out of the body of the Windrunner, to rejoin\nNavani. She took him in her arms, burying her face in his chest, trembling\nas they listened to the terrified shrieks of a spren betrayed.\nIn that instant, something ripped within the world itself. Roshar’s\nrhythms and tones froze. Like a heart suddenly stopped. Three terrible\nseconds.\nThen it was back. When the light faded, Melishi held a gemstone prison\nin his hands, and Honor was standing behind him.\n“Honor, you bastard,” Dalinar whispered. “You were responsible for all\nof this.”\n“This is why!” Navani whispered. “Why the power refuses another host,\nwhy it—”\nScreaming.\nThe singers collapsed, as if one. Drawing shockspren, Garith caught the\ndireform next to him, preventing her from hitting hard, but all four singers\nbegan to writhe and scream.\nDalinar, with Navani—Gav holding to her skirt—walked back to the\ncenter of the hollow. Garith held his direform lover … but she was losing\nher form. Dalinar had never seen a singer changing forms, but this was\ntraumatic, her carapace becoming brittle and ripping free, her body\nshrinking—the bones cracking and popping. By the time it was done—and\nshe lay limp in Garith’s arms—both were stained with orange singer blood.\nWhat had once been a femalen of imposing stature and confidence had\nshrunken to something all too familiar: one of the quiet, mostly mute\nservants who had waited on Dalinar most of his life. He felt he could see\nthe light of understanding fade from her eyes.\nShe looked up at Garith, blinking, and seemed confused. And terrified."

I … I’ll fix this.” He rose, thunder in his expression, angerspren\npooling at his feet, and started toward Melishi. “We gave our word, Melishi.\nThat we were negotiating in good faith! We swore an oath!”\nDalinar joined him, stalking across the stones, no longer caring that this\nwas all just a re-creation. Others followed him, some of those who had been\nhiding with Navani, though Kalak cowered in the back. Dalinar’s hands\nitched to close around that Bondsmith’s neck. He felt hollow, remembering\nthose awful seconds when the entire planet had gone still.\nMelishi, terrified, sought to hide behind Honor. The god continued to\nstand firm, staring them down.\n“You did this,” Garith said. “Why?”\n“It was necessary,” Honor said.\n“You are supposed to respect oaths!” Garith said, stopping right in front\nof Honor. “You embody them! How could you allow this? How?”\nHonor turned as if to leave. Garith reached for him, but as his fingers\ntouched the god …\nA vision. Injected directly into Dalinar’s mind. Of Radiants burning\nRoshar, of the sky on fire, of people dying and withering to dust. Of Garith\nhimself, glowing with power, leaving thousands—human and singer alike—\ndead. Navani gasped—and the Windrunners cried out in pain. Even Melishi\nand the Radiants who had come with him howled.\nThey all saw it. Every Radiant on Roshar. What could be. A reminder\nthat their powers could utterly lay waste to an entire world. It had happened\nbefore.\n“You,” Honor said, “are destruction incarnate. You are as Dawnshards.\nYou will soon become Surges unbounded, as I cannot watch you any longer.\nThe Radiants will end this planet.”\nHis words thundered through Dalinar’s heart, and he finally understood\nthe Recreance. All these years, and now he understood. Garith would walk\naway from his oaths, as would most of the others, because what were words\nlike those after a tragedy like this? After God abandoned you, and you saw\nwhat you believed was the future?\nThe vision faded, and Garith stumbled back, returning to his fallen love.\nHonor remained in place—and strangely, the deity’s expression changed.\nHe focused on Dalinar, then Navani, then sighed.\nThis … this wasn’t the past playing out. Dalinar saw as much in the\ngod’s eyes. Honor had seen him.\n“Blood of my fathers,” Dalinar said. “You’re not dead, are you? You\nnever were. It was an act?”\n“No,” the being said, and its voice was familiar. “It’s me. I was created\nin his image.”"

Why?”\n“You, Dalinar,” the Stormfather said, sounding exhausted, “have seen far\ntoo much. I hope you are satisfied. I … I must stop hiding you from Odium.\nYou are his. And this is … this is his domain now.” He vanished, and\nDalinar was cast into the chaos of the Spiritual Realm again.\nThis time, when he tried to find the lines of light Connecting him to\npeople and places, he discovered they had vanished. And a shadow loomed\nover him.\nOdium.\nRenarin knelt beside the fallen singer as the Windrunner returned to her side\nand cradled her.\nRenarin felt powerless. He thought his gasp earlier—while hiding in the\nleaves—might have ruined things. It hadn’t, fortunately, but seeing a singer\nand a human kiss …\nThis had all been started by love. Love and betrayal.\nThe poor Windrunner didn’t look at Renarin. He clung to his love and\nstarted humming. A rhythm. The Rhythm of Joy. A human, outside of one of\nthe visions, had learned them—and was desperately trying to bring her\nback.\nA hand on his shoulder. Rlain’s, though he was in the body of another\nRadiant spy. He hummed to the Lost.\n“I know why she hates us now,” Renarin whispered. “I’d hate us too.”\n“She’s wrong,” Rlain said.\nRenarin glanced at him. “How can you say that? After seeing this?”\n“I see,” Rlain said, regarding the others around the hollow, “people.\nSome who have done evil things, yes, but others who have loved. Renarin,\nyou asked how it is for us. We feel love, as any human does. But we’re\nafraid of it because we associate powerful emotions with him.” He squeezed\nRenarin’s shoulder. “Doesn’t stop us from hating. In that, he wins, because\nhe scares us away from the beautiful emotions and leaves only the\ndestructive ones.”\nStorms. Renarin stood up next to him.\n“She’s wrong,” Rlain said, “if she hates humans. Because it merely gives\nhim what he wants: two sides delineated simply. One who can just be ‘the\nenemy.’ People can be wonderful or terrible; an enemy, though, can only be\nsomething to fight.” He looked down, then hummed to Anxiety. “Does that\nsound trite?”\n“A little,” Renarin said. “The thing is, the deepest truths always sound a\nlittle trite. Because we all know them, and feel foolish being reminded.”\nShallan passed by—Glys warned him it was her—and scanned the\ncrowd, her eyes narrowed. Looking for Mraize or Iyatil.\nNo one here, Glys said, plays their part poorly. Perhaps they are lost,\nand did not find this day?\nShallan waved them forward. “Hurry.

What could\nhe do to help?\n“I’ll make it right,” Renarin whispered.\nThe Windrunner looked up, and seemed to see him. Somehow, across\ntime, through the void that was Beyond, this man saw Renarin. He gasped.\n“I promise,” Renarin said. “I’ll find a way.”\nThe man nodded, tears in his eyes, and Renarin finally hurried after the\nother two. But they were too late. The vision started to unravel, though\nRenarin heard something first.\n“Stormfather. You were here; you did see all of this.” Renarin’s father.\n“You’ve known the truth all along—it was lies when you said you didn’t\nremember. Why?”\n“You, Dalinar”—a booming voice, like thunder—“have seen far too\nmuch. I hope you are satisfied. I … I must stop hiding you from Odium.\nYou are his. And this is … this is his domain now.”\nEverything burst apart, and Renarin lost track of them all—not just his\nfather, but Shallan and Rlain.\nI can find them, Glys said. I will.\nThe shifting smoke stabilized around him, becoming an expanse of black\nstone—not much to see. Glys—who hid inside Renarin again—struggled to\nhold it together.\nShallan, Rlain, Pattern, and Testament formed from that mist as it\nretreated.\n“Did you see where the man went?” Shallan asked, turning around. “The\none carrying Mishram’s prison?”\n“I managed to,” Rlain said. “He opened a perpendicularity and was\npulled through.”\n“The Bondsmith went straight into the Spiritual Realm,” Pattern said.\n“Mmmm … Then he was lost. He carried the prison into his tomb.”\n“So we didn’t learn anything new,” Shallan said, folding her arms. “We\nalready knew he was in here.”\n“We need a Connection,” Renarin said, feeling tired. How long had they\nbeen here? An entire day, or maybe two, even? He should need sleep,\nsomething to drink, shouldn’t he?\n“What was that?” Rlain asked. “You said a Connection.”\n“That’s the way to find things in here,” Renarin said. “It’s how Father\nand Navani did it.”\n“Mishram’s prison is in here somewhere,” Shallan said, “and locations in\nthe Spiritual Realm aren’t … really locations. They’re like … memories,\nthoughts. All you need to reach a distinct point is the right Connection.”\n“We just saw the prison being made,” Rlain said. “Isn’t that enough?”\n“No, unfortunately,” Renarin said, thinking back to what Glys had said\nearlier. He felt the spren vibrating within him, to what he thought was the\nRhythm of the Lost. To find the lost … you needed more than superficial\nConnection. “We have to know how she felt. We have to know Mishram.\nDeeper than seeing, we have to feel it.”"

He considered how Mishram must\nhave felt, being betrayed, and something occurred to him. “Glys. Where\nwere the other Unmade when this happened? Were they fighting\nsomewhere?”\nNo, they knew, Glys said. Some were there. They watched.\nWhat?\n“They were there?” To Rlain’s confused glance, he explained. “Glys says\nthe other Unmade were there watching.”\n“Tumi agrees,” Rlain said. “He says he could feel them. I didn’t see\nanything. Did you?”\n“No.”\n“Sja-anat is often invisible,” Shallan said.\nShe … was there, Glys said. That is part of why she sent us to you. She\nhas not spoken of the events she saw, but she feels pain for them.\nThere was something here, if Renarin could just …\nRenarin! Glys said with a sudden urgency. Another watches us! What is\nthat?\nRenarin followed Glys’s prompting, and turned to see something\napproaching across the expanse of simple dark stone and a black sky, lit—\nlike some places in Shadesmar—with some unseen, inexplicable light. The\nfigure wore plain leathers, as Shallan had been wearing when she’d entered\nthis place. Its face was a dark swirl of mist, like a whirlpool of smoke.\n“What is it?” Rlain asked, subtly putting himself between the thing and\nRenarin.\n“It’s me,” Shallan whispered. “I’m making it somehow.” She reached out\nher hand, palm forward. The thing froze. “Storms. I … I should be more in\ncontrol. I’m sorry. I …” She looked to Renarin, and her face was panicked,\nso full of emotion even he could tell what she was feeling. “We need to\nleave. Go somewhere more stable. Please.”\nI will try, Glys said. But it is harder now. I do not know why. Unless …\n“Unless?” Renarin whispered.\nUnless it’s his influence. Renarin! The sky!\nA shadow rose in the distance. Dark, ominous, with a crown that\nstretched toward the heavens, and golden light pouring from its eyes.\n“Now, now,” Odium said, his voice—strangely familiar—booming\nacross them. “I see. Rats in the walls. Amazing that you could all hide from\nme. Unfortunately, I’m quite busy. So why don’t you stay where I put you\nuntil I’m ready?”\nThey were cast into the mist, the vision bursting, separating them in a\nflurry of power.\nTHE END OF\nDay Seven\nBeing a queen was supposed to have been awesome.\nIt was not awesome.\nIt was awful.\nMaybe that was because they didn’t let Lift do anything truly queenly,\neven if she was wearing an illusion of Navani’s face and body.

In a\nmoment of trying to be more reasonable, she’d even asked that they let her\nplay with that stuff that blew up when you mixed it, like Navani did. Lift\nhad promised she’d heal if she lost any appendages that she really needed.\nEach time, her keepers—Brightlady Khal and Brightlord Aladar—had\nlaughed. As if she were joking. Except they didn’t laugh when she was\nactually joking, and said that Aladar’s face looked like he’d sneezed when\nhe was brushing his teeth, and had frozen that way.\n“You … sneeze when you brush your teeth?” he’d asked her instead.\nWell, yeah. Sometimes, she supposed. She didn’t track it or anything.\nShe sat back in her “throne” with a huff. Navani didn’t even have a\nproper throne room from which Lift could spout dictates and yell for\npeople’s heads to be offed. Instead, Navani had an office. For meetings. It\nhad a nice chair, but it wasn’t a throne at all.\nToday, the desk was arrayed with a wide variety of foods, all exotic, to\nkeep Lift distracted. That’s what they did—pile food in front of her. Have\nher walk the hallways so everyone thought Navani was still here, and not\nsucked through a hole into the past or something. They’d have her cancel\nmeetings claiming fatigue, then they’d stick her in Navani’s rooms. They\nkept giving her games or books to try to keep her occupied. As if she could\nread. “Young ladies are supposed to like these,” they said. As if she were a\nlady.\nShe pushed her plate around with a fork, sitting on Navani’s chair with\nher legs hanging over the side. She looked like Navani, even to herself, but\nthe illusion wasn’t great.\nWell, it was kind of great. Wit was good with this stuff. But Lift was\nshorter than Navani, so the illusion always had to include a full gown to\nhide that her waist was far lower. And though the illusion looked like it was\nstaring people in the eyes, she was actually looking out from the chest\nsomewhere, which could be kind of distracting. Like having two bowls\nstrapped to the sides of your face.\n“Lift?” Wyndle said, forming his bearded face from a pile of vines, his\neyes as crystalline gemstones and seeming worried. “You aren’t … eating?\nLook at all of this expensive food they’re forced to give you to keep you out\nof trouble!”\n“Don’t wannit,” she mumbled, her voice Navani’s.\n“Is that caviar? Lift, that’s caviar!”\nShe flopped onto her stomach, laying across the chair with her waist on\none armrest, her upper chest on the other, dangling one arm down toward\nthe floor. This room was so tiny. No windows. Why would Navani have an\noffice without a window? Except for the fact that she’d want nobody to\nwatch her having private meetings, of course. Other than that.\n“Lift …” Wyndle said, sitting on the desktop, offering one vine as a hand"

You didn’t cause the explosion.”\n“You think they found Gav in there?”\n“Certainly they did! They’re Bondsmiths, Lift. Most incredible and\naccomplished of all Radiants. Why, I’ll bet they found him instantly. Lift?\nIt’s all right.”\n“There’s nothin’ I can do. Just like Wit said.”\n“So why mope?”\n“I just wanna be parta stuff,” she muttered. “I was one of the first. And\nI’m never part of anything.” She stared at the floor. “And when I am, I\nmake it go wrong. Every time. You can lie and say it ain’t true, but it ain’t\nain’t true, Wyndle. You know it always gets messed up. If I’d been better at\nthis, maybe I coulda saved Gav. I didn’t. Couldn’t even save myself.\n“So they lock me in a room when the world’s gotta be saved, otherwise\n… I’ll trip. I’ll knock into people. People are dyin’. Gav is lost. But I’m\nhere in this uncomfortable chair, savin’ nobody. Because if I were there? It\ngoes wrong. They know it.”\n“The chair is uncomfortable?”\n“Mmmph.”\n“Have you tried … sitting in it?”\nShe flopped around, lying back across the armrests and staring at the\nceiling.\n“Storms …” Wyndle said. “No wisecrack?”\n“Mmmph.”\n“This is dire. Dire indeed. I … um … I …” He drew himself up, then\noffered the secret handshake.\nWell, storm him for a Voidbringer.\nIt kind of made her feel better when he did that.\n“Lift,” the tower said, a shimmer appearing on the table in the designated\nspot. “What is ‘peeky time’?”\n“Children’s game,” Lift said, taking Wyndle’s offered hand and shaking.\n“You play it with babies, like the drooling really, really young babies who\nain’t old enough to play real games, like hitting each other with sticks.”\n“Oh, okay,” the tower said.\n“Why?” Lift asked.\n“I heard echoes of the term in a deep hallway on the thirty-third floor,”\nthe tower explained. “But there’s housing in that direction, so maybe a\nwoman was out walking her baby.”\n“You can’t tell?” Lift said.\n“I … am not fully functional without Navani,” the Sibling said, their\nvoice growing softer. “It won’t be a big problem for some weeks yet, as\nshe’s partially here. In the Spiritual Realm, she’s kind of everywhere. But\n… it is having an effect.”\nLift grunted. “You worried?”\n“I shouldn’t be. I didn’t want to be here, in this situation. I can’t decide if\nI’d rather still be asleep or not, and Navani can be … determined when she\nwants something. I chose to accept her Words, and it was my decision, but I\n… I waver.”\n“I’m glad you’re awake,” Lift said. “You make the tower all deevy.”"

Need a new\nword.” She flopped around to where she was lying on the chair with her feet\nin the air and her head hanging down under the desk. “Hey, Tower. What\ndid this voice you heard sound like?”\n“I can re-create it,” the Sibling said, and projected the sound of a distant,\ninhuman voice saying “peeky time” in the most forlorn way ever.\nLift slammed her head against the underside of the desk as she tried to sit\nup. “Storms! Ow! Storming storming storming storming storms. Sibling,\nthat’s my storming chicken, you storming tillwallop!”\n“Your chicken can actually talk?”\n“I told you! An’ better than Wyndle!”\n“Hey!” he said.\n“You use too many words I don’t know,” Lift said, standing and rubbing\nher forehead. “That strange monster man that took the chicken, then sold\nme to the enemy? He vanished into the hole with Navani, right?”\n“By your description, yes …” the tower said.\n“So he musta left my chicken somewhere! It could be starvin’!” She\ngrabbed a plate off the desk. “Do chickens like caviar?”\n“Maybe?” Wyndle said.\n“I’ll bring some curry just in case,” she said, grabbing another plate. “I\ngotta go save it!”\n“Lift,” the tower said, “I can send a contingent of guards. You can send a\ncontingent of guards. We—”\n“No,” Wyndle said, growing taller. “We have to do this. Ourselves.\nRight, Lift?”\n“Storming right,” she said. Then smiled at him. “Thanks for backin’ me\nup.”\n“Always,” he said.\n“And you don’t think it will be odd,” the Sibling’s shimmer of light said,\n“for the queen to go out by herself, hunting through distant hallways?”\n“Sure,” Lift said. “But you can eat the illusion, right?”\n“Well, it was made with Towerlight, so I can cancel the power sustaining\nit, but that’s not—”\n“Good enough!” Lift said. “There’s no time! My chicken needs caviar.\nBut first, record me sayin’ these words with Navani’s voice …”\nIn a second, she was back to herself. Wearing her clothing—just some\ntrousers and a loose shirt—like she’d put on this morning before being\ntransformed to Navani. Bands wrapping her chest underneath. She hated\nhow she looked most days, so that part of the illusion was nice, but this\nwasn’t a job for a queen.\nSeconds later, Lift strode out past the guards at the door, who were\nsurprised—but not that surprised—to find that Lift had somehow snuck past\nthem to pester the queen.

The Sibling projected Navani’s voice from inside,\ntelling them not to interrupt her for a while—as Lift had distracted her from\nsome very important paper reading.\nJust like that, she was free for the first time in forever—or since that\nmorning at least—to do what she wanted. And what she wanted, what she\nneeded, was to be a hero. Even if only to a single frightened animal.\nWith the Sibling’s help, they were able to figure out exactly where the evil\nguy’s den was. A room that the Sibling, upon focusing on it, couldn’t sense.\n“Ralkalest,” the Sibling explained from a glowing spot on the wall in a\nback corridor. “You probably call it aluminum. Some of the rooms in the\ntower have to be lined in it for practical reasons. Sometimes you need to\ncontain a being of immense power. I’d forgotten it was even here—as I\ncan’t sense what’s inside.”\nLift had positioned herself underneath the room. The corridor one level\ndown went under it. Since the lock mechanism appeared to be jammed, this\nfelt like the best way in.\n“Aluminum?” Wyndle said. “Oh … I don’t like that. We could get\ntrapped!”\n“We ain’t gonna get trapped,” Lift said, climbing up the wall on some\nvines he’d grown for her. Soon she was hanging upside down, her long dark\nhair falling around her head. “But we are gonna be careful in case that\nmonster man with the scars left guards or somethin’. That might be why the\ndoor won’t open. Now hush and turn into a sword.”\n“But I can’t cut through aluminum!”\n“What?” Lift said. “What use is a sword what can’t cut stuff?” Storming\nspren. Every time she needed him …\n“The sheeting is very thin,” the Sibling explained. “Because it’s so\nvaluable. Basically just foiling. You should be able to punch through, even\nwith a Shardblade.”\n“Glad someone is useful. Now hush, both of you.”\n“Okay,” Wyndle said, “but why come in from the bottom?”\n“More dynamic,” Lift said, then thrust her hand to the side and he\nappeared as a sword. She didn’t do that often, as swords felt … wrong to\nher. But they were good for chopping. She sliced a circle out of the ceiling,\nand indeed, did hit some resistance. It stopped the Blade more soundly than\nthe Sibling had thought it might. However, once she got a chunk of the\nceiling out, she could reach up and bend back the sheets of metal and pry\nthem out of the way. They weren’t terribly thick, so she managed it, after\nturning Wyndle into a crowbar.\nAfter some further effort, she got a nice Lift-sized circle cut out of the\nceiling. The blocks of stone that she cut out had been clattering to the\nground—and the last, biggest ones fell with a crash to wake the dead. She\nwinced.\nIs that part of being dynamic?

She stuck her head up into a round stone chamber, with some\nbooks in a case along one wall and lit by some spheres on top of it. Other\nthan that, the only furniture was a mattress on the floor.\nHowever, a cage hung from the ceiling with her chicken in it. Her heart\nleaped. Hanging near it was some old guy. He seemed to be unconscious, or\nmaybe dead, hanging by a chain from the ceiling, and was way, way too\nnaked.\n“Ugh,” Lift said, wincing.\n“What?” Wyndle said, growing up beside her. “You’re always staring at\nmen—”\n“Not old ones,” she said. And not one who looked like this, bloodied\nfrom what had probably been torture. It turned her stomach to see the poor\nman like that. Plus he was bearded and rather hairy. Like, actually really\nhairy.\n“Bleck,” she muttered, then hauled herself up inside. Seemed empty\notherwise. So she took some caviar out of her pocket and climbed on the\nbookcase to offer it to the chicken. “Hey. Hey, I’m here. I got you.”\nThe animal’s feathers looked terrible—worn and ragged, faded, rather\nthan the chipper bright red she’d seen from it just before the occupation. It\nstill had that hurt wing, but it perked up when it saw her and got excited.\n“Hello!” it said. “Hello, hello, hello!”\nNearby, the man hanging by the chains stirred. Lift got the door to the\nchicken’s cage open and the animal out, after which it clung to her arm with\nclaws that were way too sharp. The man blinked open red eyes, then\nfrowned.\n“That is … unexpected,” he said.\n“You need help?” Lift said, clutching her chicken close. “’Cuz uh … I’m\nmaybe a hero or somethin’.”\n“That would be appreciated,” the man said, his voice ragged. “Quickly\nthough, before—”\nThe door opened. The supposedly broken door. Yeah, Lift loved being\nright, but she could have been wrong now and it would have been okay.\nThree people entered, and they were not official guards or anything like\nthat. Two thugs, with knives strapped to them. One woman in a havah, with\nrings glittering on her fingers. It took one glance from the woman—her\nexpression angry—for Lift to guess these were associates of the terrible\nman who had taken her captive and sold her to the enemy.\nStorming Sibling bein’ blind lately. Lift growled, then summoned\nWyndle as a sword and shouted, “Hey Sibling, if you can hear, send those\nguards! I really shoulda listened to you!”\nNo reply. But if the tower heard the bird, then it could hear her. Lift\ndidn’t try to engage the two thugs as they surged toward her, but instead\nswung her Blade for the chains holding the captive to the ceiling. It didn’t\nwork, because of course she wasn’t storming lucky enough for that. The\nchains were something the sword couldn’t cut."

She hated the\nweakness inside that refused to admit, deep down, that she was alone. She\nhated that she’d gotten Gav in trouble, and couldn’t help, because she\ncouldn’t figure out how to work with this stupid body that kept growing.\nToday, she was mad.\nThey shouldn’t have pushed her today.

She hopped free as the\nwoman met her eyes, and Lift knew … somehow knew … the woman was\nawesome too. So Lift was ready as the woman came zipping through the\nroom, insanely fast.\nThe ground became full of traction, and the woman, in her speed, hit the\npatch. Snaps announced the woman’s legs breaking as she put too much\nforce behind her motions, and she tripped as Lift always did.\nLift came to a sliding rest beside the toppled bookcase. Hair falling\naround her face. None of the three moved. The only sound was that of the\nchain rotating as the man looked toward her.\nLift stood up, sweat streaming from her, and felt a powerful headache\ncoming on. Wait. That … that was Zahel hanging there. The sword ardent—\nshe usually saw him when she went to watch the guys training. With the\nblood and that hair, she hadn’t realized … She cringed beneath his gaze.\nWhy was he peering at her so intently?\n“That was,” he said—and she winced at what might come next\n—“perhaps the most impressive display of raw talent I’ve ever witnessed.”\nShe … slowly uncringed. “What? I fell over myself.”\n“That woman is a full Feruchemist. You reacted in time despite her\nmanyfold speed enhancement. And the use of Abrasion … your\nmanipulation of forces …”\nLift looked to Wyndle, who was appearing from his vines as they regrew\nbeside her. He gave a no-shoulder shrug.\n“I usually trip,” Lift said. “Like, a lot. I’m terrible at this.”\n“You ever seen someone new to Shardplate try to walk, child?” the\nswordmaster asked.\n“… No?”\n“Incredible power,” he said, “demands incredible training, otherwise it\ncan manifest as clumsiness.” He looked at her, and seemed … different.\nWhen she’d seen him before, at the practice grounds, he’d always been so\nindifferent. Now he almost seemed to be glowing, not with Stormlight, but\nwith enthusiasm. “You need,” he said softly, “a teacher.”\n“You need,” she replied, “some pants.”\nSome guards finally arrived, and as they were cutting the man down—\nand she snuggled her chicken—Lift kept thinking back on those words. A\nteacher. She’d had lots that had wanted to teach her. She’d run from them.\nWas this different? Could this be different? Did she want it to be? That\nwould mean changing.\nBut everything … everything was changing, no matter what she decided.\nEven the Nightwatcher had lied to her. She couldn’t pretend she was ten\nanymore. Pretending she was ten …\nThat had gotten Gav in trouble. Because she refused to grow, and\nrefusing to grow meant refusing to learn. She hated it, but she couldn’t. And\nif she wanted to stop being useless …\nMaybe …\nStorms. If everything was going to change, she had to change with it,\ndidn’t she?

Feeling so lanky and awful, she\nlooked away, arms wrapped around herself, but spoke softly.\n“How would we start?”\nOdium turned from Sja-anat’s rats in the Spiritual Realm, and focused his\nattention on Dalinar. All the while, he accepted his sorrow at what he’d\ndone to Kharbranth. Proof must be given of a conviction, or it was no\nconviction at all.\nFirst Roshar, then the cosmere. The destruction of Kharbranth would be\nhis greatest sacrifice, its loss evidence of commitment. Cultivation had\nstopped arguing with him, or trying to persuade him. She had made her\nplays, and had failed.\nNow a chull of a man was all that stood in his path. Dalinar’s future was\ncloudy to him though. Just as he hadn’t been able to foresee Cultivation’s\nattack on Kharbranth, Taravangian couldn’t see this man’s choices.\nInteracting with someone who was tainted by one who saw the future made\nit more difficult to see—especially in the short term.\nAs Dalinar trembled, huddled and isolated in the Spiritual Realm, Odium\nrecognized something. His plans would be a grand kindness to this man—a\nway for Dalinar to obtain his potential. First, though, he needed Dalinar to\nacknowledge that Odium’s way had been the right way all along.\nOdium would win the contest, of course, because either outcome served\nhim. But the end he truly needed was the one where Dalinar joined him.\nHow to make the man see? How to get him to accept the correct future?\nThe answer was simple. He had to break his old friend down so he could\nbe rebuilt. Fortunately, Odium had experience at this. Both in hurting\nDalinar, and in handling the subsequent pain of being forced to do so.\nIndeed, he was growing to be quite expert at it.\nI sense I’ve done a poor job of explaining the exact nature of\nantiLight.

But standing tall because someone had to, and he had\naccepted this burden of leadership.\nHe would grieve later. For the defenders’ sake, he could not do so now.\nHe gave the orders, and supervised their forces retreating from Narak Three\nonto the Oathgate platform. Once Sigzil gave the sign the Stonewards—\nusing some of the last remaining Stormlight—dropped the bridge into the\nchasm.\nAcross the gap, on their newly won plateau, the singers rejoiced. They\nwould find a pile of uninfused gemstones in the storehouse they’d won.\nHopefully they would think the defenders had simply used up all the Light\nin the defense, and wouldn’t realize the trick Sigzil had pulled.\nSigzil breathed out misting breaths, then drifted back through harder rain\nthan normal. He pulled his raincoat tight and settled onto the battlements of\nNarak Prime. Since the battle was over, he didn’t dare fly too much, as they\nhad to preserve Stormlight.\nStorms. He looked through the rain toward the new ranks of Radiants\narrayed below, sent by Jasnah for the support of Narak—but he couldn’t\ndeploy them. He was limited not by the number of Radiants he had, but by\nthe number of gemstones he could use to equip them. He stood there a long\nwhile, feeling the deflation that followed a battle, the winding down of both\nemotion and muscle. They didn’t need him right now, as the logisticians and\nhealers would deal with this part, but he remained where he could be seen.\nGeneral Winn eventually joined him on the battlements, climbing with\neffort in the rain. “Retreat was executed perfectly, Brightlord,” the man\nsaid. The elderly general wasn’t fit enough to hold a weapon himself, but\nhad done a great deal of work behind the scenes to make the retreat go\nsmoothly.\nBut they still had two days left, and couldn’t afford to lose another\nplateau. Sigzil needed to think of a way to help them last, somehow, despite\nhis distractions.\n“General Winn,” Sigzil said, watching the soldiers crowd the grounds\nbelow, seeking medical attention. Most of his soldiers would have to camp\nout in the rain now, as they’d lost a great number of their barracks with the\nabandonment of Narak Three. “How do you deal with the loss of soldiers\nunder your command? Personally, I mean.”\n“That’s a question without many good answers, Brightlord,” the older\nman said, leaning against the battlement beside Sigzil, rain pelting their\ncoats. “At my age … well, loss isn’t an occasion, but a state of being. Of the\nforty-five men I served with as officers under Gavilar, I’m the only one left.\nSame for my siblings. Same for … well, most anyone my age.”\n“I’m sorry,” Sigzil said.\n“They weren’t taken by a traitor before my eyes,” Winn said, resting a\nhand on Sigzil’s shoulder. “That makes it hurt more, I’m sure.

You\nfaced loss as an officer must. Be proud of that.”\n“I don’t want to be proud,” Sigzil said. “I want to hold as we’ve been\ntold. But Winn … the Stormlight.”\n“I know. Your spren have any numbers for us?”\n“She says,” Sigzil replied, “that she expects us to run out of Stormlight\nsometime today, early tomorrow at the latest, depending on how much we\nhave to fly and how much the Stonewards have to repair the walls.”\nThey fell quiet. Vienta whispered some other numbers in his ear—her\nestimates of casualties, which were generally accurate. Information that\nhe’d asked for, and that he appreciated, but when added to the falling rain\nand Winn’s general sense of uncertainty …\n“What do we do?” Sigzil asked.\n“Sir,” General Winn said, “I … am kind of hoping that’s something\nyou’ll be able to answer. We’re going to need a plan. And under the\ncircumstances, it will likely need to be something unconventional. You got\nus this far. Do you have any more ideas?”\n“I’m working on it,” Sigzil promised. “But honestly, I’m hoping\nsomeone else has a miracle to suggest this time. Once everyone is settled,\ncall a planning meeting.”\nChaos.\nShifting faces, but each bloody, each dying.\nPeople Dalinar had known, people he’d fought beside, people he’d\nkilled. Then … something new.\nA world he didn’t know. A distant place where he brought death,\ndestruction, and waste as the Blackthorn, in armor the color of coal. A\nworld of strange beautiful architecture, all aflame; he ground its ashes\nbeneath his heels.\nJolt.\nThe apparitions vanished, and he was … he was in the Kholinar palace?\nWearing an Alethi uniform stained by wine on one cuff, the top buttons of\nthe jacket undone. Around him, ardents in grey robes brought food to\ncommon people seated in rows on the floor. A Beggars’ Feast? Yes … yes,\nthey’d often had these during Gavilar’s reign.\n“Hey,” someone said, slapping him on the shoulder. “Rortel. I got some.\nLet’s go.”\nRortel … that had been one of Dalinar’s elites. He’d died in an early\nplateau assault, but this was before that, and Dalinar apparently wore his\nbody. The man who spoke to him was Malan, a tall green-eyed fellow with\ndark curly hair—a member of the Cobalt Guard. He carried a jug of wine.\n“Come on,” Malan repeated. “Let’s go.”\nDalinar let himself be pulled from his seat. Storms. Dalinar … knew this\nnight, didn’t he? It was a night where he had failed. He followed Malan\nthrough the doorway, past a beggar sitting outside by the wall. Dalinar\nstopped, because he knew this beggar.

All those years, I never recognized you …” The king of Heralds had\nbeen here, this night of all nights.\nJezrien took his hand. “Have you seen me?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “I see you now, my friend.”\n“The man I was,” Jezrien said. “He escaped me. I let him go, like leaves\nbefore a storm. Have you seen him? I … would be him again. Please.”\nDalinar squeezed the Herald’s hand, but it was just a vision and Malan\ngrabbed him by the shoulder. “Come on. Dalinar wants that wine.”\n“Dalinar,” Dalinar said, “has had plenty of wine. He didn’t need to send\nus to steal some from the Beggars’ Feast. He’s an embarrassment to his\nname.”\nMalan pulled him to his feet. “Watch what you say. We have orders.”\n“Orders given by a drunkard,” Dalinar said, exhausted. “I don’t need to\nsee this day again—I lived it.”\nMalan looked at him as if he were mad, and perhaps he was. Then shouts\nrose in the near distance. Malan went on the alert, gripping his sword.\nDalinar instead knelt by Jezrien again. “I know you’re not real,” Dalinar\nwhispered to him, “but I have seen the man you were. He wasn’t perfect,\nbut he did his best to protect us. Thank you.”\nThe beggar regarded him, and seemed to grow lucid for a moment.\n“Have you seen yourself?”\n“I think I am about to,” Dalinar said.\n“Don’t lose him,” Jezrien said, urgently. “Don’t let go of him.” He gazed\nupward. “I can sometimes feel where I need to be … so I came here …”\nSoldiers dashed down the hallway, yelling that an assassin was heading\ntoward the king’s chamber. They would be too late, Dalinar knew, and for\nthat they should be grateful. Szeth, possessing powers that hadn’t been seen\nin Alethkar for two thousand years, had slaughtered all who stood against\nhim.\n“We have to rouse the Blackthorn,” Malan said, again taking Dalinar\nfirmly by the shoulder. “Let’s go.”\nDalinar let himself be taken. In truth, he remembered little of this part of\nthe night. Because …\nBecause there he was in the feast hall, where the news of the attack\nhadn’t yet reached. Dancers were retreating, chatting to one another, and the\nParshendi drums sat abandoned. People talked in the dimmer light of\nshielded gemstones, and a woman played a flute among spinning\nmusicspren.\nDalinar slumped alone at one of the lower tables, his head down on the\nwood as he grumbled that the serving staff—on Navani’s orders—refused to\nbring him anything more to drink. He pointed at the soldiers as they arrived.\n“You found some?” he said, each word slurred. “Give me.”"

Drink,” younger Dalinar demanded. “I can still hear her. I\nwant her gone.”\nHe fumbled for the jug of wine while Dalinar—older Dalinar—looked\non in revulsion. Most people drank a little too much now and then, but this\nwas something else: A man who could not be trusted. A man who had long\nago betrayed himself and everyone who loved him—and would soon reap\nhis reward.\nThis was a man Dalinar hated. Both versions of him agreed on that point.\nSeeing his younger self like this made him sick.\n“Sir,” Malan said as young Dalinar took a pull straight from the jug,\n“you need to—”\nOlder Dalinar slapped his younger self, making him spit wine. Malan\nbacked away, shocked, as this was not normal behavior from his friend—\nboth were quite effective enablers. Young Dalinar bellowed at the insult,\nstumbling to his feet. When he lunged, older Dalinar—one hand casually\nbehind his back—sidestepped, then slapped him soundly across the face\nagain.\nWhen younger Dalinar came in roaring, older Dalinar caught him by the\nfront of his wine-stained shirt. “Your brother is dying,” older Dalinar said.\n“Right now.”\nYounger Dalinar looked at him, blinked red eyes, and it seemed to sink\nin. “Gavilar.”\n“Is being murdered,” older Dalinar said.\n“Gavilar?” Younger Dalinar pulled free of the grip and stumbled toward\nthe door. He toppled to the floor halfway there. Falling into an unconscious\nstupor.\nBrother, follow the Codes tonight …\nDalinar heaved a sigh, shaking his head. “What a disgrace.” His words\nmade couples shy away, and Malan went running, probably to try to help\nthe king. He was a good soldier, when properly led.\n“Curious,” a voice said, thrumming through the walls, making the entire\nvision shake. “The man you were. Such an embarrassment. Does it hurt to\nsee it?”\n“I know what I was,” Dalinar said, standing tall. “I know I can never\nescape it, because I cannot bring Gavilar back. But I keep taking steps! You\nhear me. I keep taking—”\nThe vision shifted. In the blink of an eye, he was in another room. Cold,\nwith Gavilar’s corpse lying on a table. Older Dalinar did remember this—\nwhen he woke from his stupor, and was brought here to see …\nYounger Dalinar stumbled down the steps into the room, then howled.\nOlder Dalinar winced, despite what he’d said earlier, looking away as his\nyounger self rushed to the body, then hugged it, heedless of the blood.\nWeeping with a raw pain that …\nStorms, he knew that pain. It … did still hurt, all these years later. Like a\nwound that some surgeon had dug into with knife and forceps.\nBrother, follow the Codes tonight …\n“Grampa?” a voice said from behind him."

Yes, the child was standing among the\nguards, unseen by Dalinar at first. Dalinar immediately pushed forward,\nseizing Gav as the realm again went dark and shifting.\n“Grampa,” Gav whispered. “You found me. Who was that dead man?\nWhy were there two of you?”\n“The dead man was your other grandpa, Gav,” Dalinar said. “My\nbrother, the man you were named after. I … let him die.”\n“Like … you had to let Daddy die?”\nDalinar closed his eyes, holding the child tight as the Spiritual Realm\nbecame chaos again.\n“Everyone dies,” Gav whispered. “We see so many people. Killing. And\ndying. And killing. And dying. Gram says these pretends happened long\nago. So many being killed …”\nStorms. Dalinar clutched the child, thinking how it must be for him,\nseeing the Desolations. After a lifetime on the battlefield, Dalinar was\nfamiliar with its destruction. Maybe … maybe desensitized. He should have\nthought more about the child.\n“There will be peace, Gav,” Dalinar promised. “That’s what I’m working\nfor—what you and I are fighting for.”\n“Will there?” Gav whispered, his head against Dalinar’s chest. “I don’t\nsee it, Grampa. When I open my eyes, I see us fighting forever, and ever,\nand ever … And I have to be a soldier. I have to be strong and fight … like\nyou.”\n“There will be an end, Gav. I’ll find it.”\nHolding Gav, with a storm of uncertainty around him, Dalinar finally\nunderstood something about himself. The drive that had first sent him\nlooking for Bondsmiths to train under, then into the Spiritual Realm … it\nhad been spurred by a growing distrust of the Stormfather and Honor, and\nof this plan to bind Odium.\nDalinar opened his eyes, and confronted it. The power swirling around\nhim was Honor’s power—which refused to bond to another person. In it he\nsaw death and destruction, and now—repeated over and over—he saw the\nvision he’d lived earlier. Humankind betraying Mishram. Again and again.\n“What happens,” Dalinar asked the power, “if we make peace? If I win\nthe contest?”\nHe saw it play out in a thousand different ways. Mankind would break\nthat peace. Of course they would—Odium would ensure they did. Yes,\nOdium would keep his part. But he would insult, he would demean. He\nwould enslave the humans in his lands, grinding them into the ground until\ntheir relatives in free countries demanded retribution. And war started\nagain, for while a god could not break his word, humans could.\nHumans always could …\n“It doesn’t have to be like that,” Dalinar whispered. “Nothing we see has\nto be …”\nYet it seemed a sham to him now. Peace via contract? Even if he secured\nit, they’d circle back to this problem in the future. The same cycle he’d seen\nplay out time, and time, and time, and time again in these visions. Death,"

Death,\ndestruction, fighting, war.\nThere would be no peace until the root problem was dealt with. And this\ntreaty was no more than putting a bandage on a gut wound. Honor’s plan\nwas flawed. It always had been.\n“That’s why I need you,” Dalinar said to the power swirling around him.\n“I need the strength to deal with Odium personally, to end the war at its\nvery roots!”\n“You?” a voice said, a shadow falling over him. It was Odium’s voice\nfrom earlier, in the vision. Different from when he’d heard it before. Now\nfaintly familiar … “You, Dalinar Kholin, think you can make peace? You\nbreak everything you touch. You took the throne from Elhokar, then sent\nhim to die. You want to be a god because you want power.”\n“No,” Dalinar said, frowning. “You don’t know me. You—”\nOdium’s strength swept across him, and ripped Gav from his arms. It\nsent Dalinar tumbling through darkness. Visions began to assault him,\nrelentless, knocking down his defenses—his confidence wearing thin.\nAnd Dalinar Kholin knew what it was to be in Damnation itself.\nSome might assume that Light and anti-Light are opposites, as\ncan be found in philosophy, though not truly in actual physical\nscience. Hot banishes and destroys cold. Light banishes and\ndestroys dark. Likewise, one might say that Light and anti-Light\nare opposites in that they are mutually destructive.\n—From Rhythm of War, first coda, Navani Kholin\nKaladin tried to retain the peaceful feelings from the night before, but those\nevaporated as the group approached the Dustbringer monastery. Instead he\nfelt … determination? Resignation? Something in between?\nWould Szeth fight here, or would he refuse? Hold to the morals he’d\nbegun to find for himself, or bow before the pressure of expectations?\nKaladin had done all he could to prepare the man, but so had Nale.\nConceptually, Kaladin was fine with Szeth deciding he needed to kill the\nHonorbearers to protect his people. Yet something about this whole\nsituation itched at him. If he’d been in Szeth’s place, he’d feel manipulated.\nThey didn’t know the whole story, and killing when you didn’t have the\nwhole story … that made him uncomfortable, so he could fully understand\nSzeth wanting to stop. Storm it, if he wanted to stop, Szeth should have that\nright.\nThey wound up a switchback, hiking through some highlands on the\nborder between Shinovar and eastern lands. Syl had flown on ahead. Nale,\nwho seemed never to get tired, stood atop a ridge above. And as Kaladin\nfinally arrived, sweaty, he resisted the urge to draw in Stormlight. If Nale\ncould do this without it, so could Kaladin. Indeed, it was good to get some\nphysical exercise to keep his body strong.\nAt least the view was spectacular: looking back, he saw a verdant\nlandscape adorned by lakes and rivers.

From up here, it seemed less alien.\nMore … pastoral. A giant panorama like a painted canvas, with mountains\nin the distance, clouds and that river of spren far overhead, less visible in\nthe daylight than it had been at night. Those clouds were gorgeous too,\nletting sunlight break through to highlight its favorite parts of the landscape.\nThe ridge here was soil, not rock. What prevented it from simply melting\ndown in the rain? Was there solid mountain rock beneath this, like the spine\nof a person under their skin? He’d always imagined there was, but Szeth\ntalked as if the soil went down, down, down. Like an ocean, the depths of\nwhich were unknowable.\n“Look at it,” Nale said softly as Szeth, last up the switchback, joined\nthem. “This is a land of ancient laws, carried with us from a better place.\nThis land became a shard of the old world where we once lived. Its rules\nrun deep, deep as the bones of your ancestors. People I knew, spoke with,\nlaughed with, are buried here, seven thousand years dead. This is your\nheritage, Szeth.”\n“Wait,” Kaladin said. “Because laws are old, they’re good?”\n“You would discard the wisdom of your elders?” Nale asked.\n“My elders were shockingly keen on things like slavery,” Kaladin said.\n“I don’t revere anything or anyone just because of age.”\n“Do not dismiss their wisdom because of their faults, Stormblessed,”\nNale said. “Sometimes we see farther as we age. Our posture shrinking, our\nthoughts elevating.”\nUnfortunately, there was some truth in that. The Radiant orders were\nancient, and he’d grown immeasurably because of the way their oaths made\nhim stretch. The Words weren’t easy, and they hurt, but they were right. At\nthe same time though …\nWell, he’d seen too much to blindly trust that the people in charge were\nthere for a reason. A lot of laws and rules were the same—retaining their\npositions by merit of momentum, not virtue. If true nobility wasn’t of\nblood, but of the heart, as Dalinar said … then good traditions would be\nvaluable because of what they offered, not because they merely existed.\nBut how to explain all of that? In a way that didn’t make his words\nstumble over one another?\n“I’ll make my own choices,” Kaladin said. “Based on what I see and\nexperience.”\n“Your perspective is flawed.”\n“No more so than anyone else’s. No more so than the people who made\nthese laws, Nale. That’s what I keep saying.”\n“No,” Nale said. “I keep telling you these laws go back to something\ngreater.”\n“Is that why you follow them, then?” Kaladin asked. “I still don’t get it,\nNale.”\n“I do what is right because it is right.”\nKaladin ground his teeth. He needed to change the way he did this.\nLogic didn’t work with Nale, and never would. Kaladin couldn’t argue\nsomeone out of being mentally ill. Any more than someone could argue\nhim out of feeling bad. So what had worked?"

        "text": "Logic didn’t work with Nale, and never would. Kaladin couldn’t argue\nsomeone out of being mentally ill. Any more than someone could argue\nhim out of feeling bad. So what had worked?\nCertain skills—like being able to resist his own thoughts—had helped\nhim, with time and practice. That wasn’t something someone else could do\nfor Nale though. Really, the things that had helped Kaladin the most were\nthe times when Adolin had listened. Had just … talked to him.\nHe remembered how the Wind loved Nale. A weathered hero who had\nseen millennia …\n“Maybe you’re right, Nale,” Kaladin said. “You’ve seen so much more\nthan the rest of us. I’ll admit, maybe I haven’t listened to you enough.\nCould you tell me about some of the best parts of being a Herald, maybe\nfrom the early days?”\nNale eyed him, as if sensing a trap. However, he also seemed pleased to\nhave won the argument. As they continued hiking eastward—toward some\ntrees growing along the slopes—he started talking. And Kaladin caught\nSzeth watching intently.\n“The early days were some of the hardest,” Nale said. “We didn’t yet\nknow how the Surges interacted with Roshar. And the people? They lived\ndifficult lives back then, Stormblessed. In huts and dirt. Or … crem …” His\neyes unfocused a little and he swept out with a hand. “I remember my first\nrebirth. I’d joined the Heralds uncertainly, but that Return convinced me.\nThe war between humans and singers had become so bad so quickly. Odium\npersuading good singers they had to slaughter every human to ever have\npeace.\n“The best of them refused. Did you know that? We don’t talk about it.\nOdium killed so many of them before he and Honor made their pact not to\nintervene directly. Odium executed singers who wouldn’t kill for him, and\nover centuries built groups of them trained only for death. It was\nparticularly bad those early years, but …”\nHe halted in place.\n“But?” Kaladin asked.\n“I stopped them,” Nale whispered. “I stood between darkness and life,\nand I was the light …”\n“Do you remember how that felt?” Kaladin asked.\n“Painful,” Nale said. “But glorious. I wasn’t always so harsh, you know.\nI spoke of it to Lift. I should like to see her again … something about that\nchild … always outside my reach, taunting me with who I used to be …”\nNale stared ahead. He actually appeared to think about this, cocking his\nhead.\n“I do remember …” Nale said. “That feeling …”\n“We should talk about that!” Kaladin said. “When you—”\n“I was flawed then,” Nale said, with a dismissive wave of his fingers. “I\nhave learned and grown this last year.”\n“But—”\n“No more of this conversation.”\nDamnation. Kaladin had felt so close—and he was a fool for stepping in,\ntoo eager to help, speaking when he should have remained quiet. Still, it\nhinted at possible progress. That getting through to Nale wasn’t so much\nabout persuading him that he was wrong, but about reminding him of the\nperson he’d been."

That getting through to Nale wasn’t so much\nabout persuading him that he was wrong, but about reminding him of the\nperson he’d been.\n“It doesn’t matter anyway,” Szeth said, his soft voice interrupting from\nbehind. “The past is dead, Kaladin. I must think of the task ahead of me.\nThere is an Unmade here, disrupting our laws and our ways. I must focus\non stopping it.”\n“That is true,” Nale said after a moment’s thought. “An Unmade has no\njurisdiction in Shinovar. If you find one here, you can legally do as you see\nfit.” Nale turned to Szeth. “You are Truthed: one who fights for what is\nright, bearing the traditions and history of your people like a crown.\n“You are a Bearer of Honor. Your original Blade was stolen, but now you\ncarry six more. Blades that, with Jezrien’s death, no longer anchor the\nOathpact—and which are no longer bound to any Herald. They are yours,\nSzeth. You are the product of generations of preparation.”\n“Truthed,” Szeth whispered. “Szeth-son-Neturo. Truthed of Shinovar\n…”\n“I trust you to make the correct decision.” Nale turned and began\nwalking.\nAnother dramatic walkaway. Kaladin sighed, then patted Szeth on the\nshoulder. Together they followed, passing some very strange trees. They\nwere green and cone-shaped. How did they know to grow in that shape?\nAnd the leaves? They were little spikes. What was wrong with this place?\nEvery time he felt he was getting used to it and coming to appreciate its\nbeauty, he found something like this.\nTheir walk brought them to another small town, one with a stone wall,\nnestled among the trees atop the hill. The gate was open, and as they\nentered, Kaladin saw the telltale signs: furtive movements at the windows\nof barracks. Doors that shook as people pressed close to listen. A certain …\ndarkness in the air. Not quite a shimmering, but something.\nThis place was corrupted. That Unmade had hold of the Honorbearer\nhere. And storm it, Kaladin worried he had led Szeth wrong. This place did\nneed help. Why should Kaladin be encouraging Szeth to stop fighting?\nBecause he wants to, Kaladin reaffirmed. And every soldier should have\nthe option to put down their spear if they choose to and are willing to pay\nthe cost.\nKaladin had accepted and embraced his calling as a watcher at the rim.\nHe did it so that others could choose, through no act of cowardice, to live\ndifferently. If Szeth wanted to step down, they’d figure out what to do next.\nIt was the meaning of “journey before destination.” And Kaladin\nbelieved it.\nThat would have to be enough.\nAs Venli’s expedition of listeners finally reached the central plateaus—\nsneaking through the chasms amid wobbling rainspren—the signs of the\nbattle above became more and more pronounced. Figures leaping in groups\nacross the gaps. Shouts and screams to match the beat of the lightning and\nthunder. Corpses floating in the rivers. Fused. Radiants. The best of Roshar,"

The best of Roshar,\nmurdering one another yet again in an unbreakable chain of death.\nThe chasmfiends wanted to eat the dead, but they refrained at the request\nof Venli and the others. This did confuse the beasts, however. Surely eating\ndead things was fine. Humans and singers didn’t taste that good, but they’d\ndo. Fortunately, they soon found a few fallen chulls—likely from ranching\nefforts on one of the plateaus—that had been spooked and run off a ledge.\nVenli stood with the Five, water flowing around their thighs, as they\ndecided their next move.\n“I feel it just ahead,” she explained. “Maybe two plateaus over that\nway.”\n“That’s the heart of Narak itself,” Thude said to Anxiety.\n“It’s calling to us,” said Estel, a newer member of the Five, who had\nchosen to hold nimbleform. They no longer each bore a different form; that\nhad proven impractical. Plus there were more than five known forms. “It\nsheltered us during our exile. It calls to us for a reason.”\n“I’m worried,” Venli whispered to the Terrors. “Last time I did anything\nlike this, I was playing into Odium’s hands. I did it willingly. I knew what I\nwas doing. I … I wasn’t deceived. I have to admit that. But this time,\nmaybe I am? Maybe this is some kind of signal meant to draw us in.” She\nput her hands to her head, rubbing at the roots of her hairstrands. “I can’t\nshake a dreadful rhythm. I’m scared.”\n“Do you reject him?” Bila asked softly.\n“Yes,” Venli whispered. “After what he did to our people? I reject him\nwho would be our god.”\n“Then he cannot control you,” Bila said.\n“I wish that were so,” said Kivor, a hulking malen in warform. “But he is\ncrafty, and takes some unaware. Eshonai would not have gone willingly to\nhim if she’d fully known what she was doing. We five should vote. Yes,\nwe’ve come all this way, but to think we can’t turn around now is\nfoolishness.”\n“I could go ahead without you,” Venli said. “In case it’s a trap.”\n“We vote,” Kivor said, firm. “Thude. What say you? Do we go on? See\nwhat this mystery is, even if it might destroy us?”\n“I vote yes,” Thude said. “If it destroys us, so be it, but we must find the\nanswers.”\n“Why?” Bila asked, her face shrouded in darkness, for they dared not use\ngemstones here. Overhead, humans shouted and Windrunners streaked\nthrough the air. “Why do we need answers?”\n“Because we’ll be destroyed without them,” a voice said from behind\nthem. They turned, looking at another shadow—though Leshwi’s voice\nannounced who she was. “What are we? Some thousand, against the might\nof Odium? We shall need some way to resist.

I can’t help thinking that\nwhatever you’re hearing … it’s been sent to us for a purpose.”\nNone of the Heavenly Ones could hear the sound. Just Venli and—for\nsome reason—the chasmfiends.\n“I …” Leshwi continued, then she blinked, her eyes starting to glow red.\n“Odium is offering his power to all who are here fighting. I could not resist.\nI’m sorry. I do not think he saw me individually or knows I am here.”\n“It took me months to learn to fully reject him,” Venli said. “We did not\nexpect you to do it in a week, Leshwi.”\n“I should be held to a higher standard,” Leshwi said. “I am Fused. I am\nimmortal. I—”\n“Think of yourself as young again, Lady Leshwi,” Venli said gently, to\nPeace. Though admittedly, there was a part of her that felt a thrill at being\nable to speak commandingly to one who had held such power over her.\n“You are starting over. Right now, the important question is: Will your\nnature give us away? Will he see you if you remain with us?”\n“I honestly don’t know,” she said. “I and the others should hold back a\nlittle from what you do next.”\nIt was a wise offer. They accepted it, then the rest of the Five voted one\nat a time. It was unanimous to continue. They did not ask Venli for her vote,\nas she did not lead, even if she’d guided them this far. Leaving the\nHeavenly Ones and the chasmfiends behind for now, Venli and the other\nfourteen listeners crept inward.\nThat tone thundered in her ears. It was … it was ahead … but down …\nThey reached the central plateau itself. Above, the humans had set up\nwatchposts hanging over the chasms. They were tattered and broken,\npresumably damaged in the battle. Perhaps they had been used in an effort\nto spot Deepest Ones. Nervously, Venli peeked into Shadesmar to see if any\nFused were nearby, but found only an expanse of beads—with glowing\nflames higher up, representing the fighting humans and singers.\nExcept … the beating … was lower. Beneath the beads. Beneath the\nground.\n“What?” Thude whispered.\n“It’s underneath us,” Venli whispered. She pressed her hand against the\nchasm wall as she crouched in the flowing water.\nYes, the stones said to her. You are nearly here.\nClosing her eyes, she drew in Stormlight. Rock flowed like water,\npushing back the river as it rose up on the sides, creating a hole in the wall\nthat was protected from the stream by a lip. She climbed in, and peered\ndown a tunnel that led far beneath the ground.\nA light shone at the distant end. She looked to the Five. Thude appointed\nthe remaining nine to stay back and watch, then—humming to\nDetermination—Venli and the Five started into the tunnel.\nJasnah and Fen agreed on a compromise.

        "text": "Determination—Venli and the Five started into the tunnel.\nJasnah and Fen agreed on a compromise. Their Radiants had left Thaylen\nCity through the Oathgate to support the beleaguered forces on the\nShattered Plains. She wished she could get them to Adolin and Yanagawn,\nbut with the Oathgate there in enemy hands, the corrupted spren refused to\naccept transfers.\nHopefully the Shattered Plains could use them, though she worried about\ntheir Stormlight reserves—with her mother and uncle still absent, and Wit\nbeing cagey about when they might return. In addition, the compromise\nwith Fen required the bulk of Jasnah’s conventional troops to remain at\nThaylen City. It would take costly Stormlight to get them transferred—so\nthe Radiants made sense as the first step.\nAs she stood outside the Oathgate platform—watching it flash with light\nas the last batch of Radiants vanished—she considered the wobbling knees\nof their coalition. Too few troops had been sent to Azimir. Fen’s arguments\n—that the bulk of the Alethi forces would soon arrive to help defend the\ncapital—had seemed sound. Except that Emul and Tashikk had turned on\nthem, shockingly, and attacked those troops.\nShe felt like she should have seen that. It was a huge political upheaval,\nthe final shattering of the Azish Empire, and she still reeled from it\nhappening in this day and age. But it was even more horrifying in context.\nJasnah sat on troops that weren’t needed, while Adolin—according to the\nregular updates she received from May Aladar—fought desperately, low on\nresources, isolated without a functional Oathgate.\nThe Crzmak Stability, she thought, turning and walking through the city,\nwearing her uniform, unaccompanied by bodyguards. She’d sent those with\nthe Radiants to support Sigzil. Some centuries ago, a coalition had risen\namong the squabbling families of Thaylenah, led by the charismatic\nexplorer Crzmak. Its fate was an example of how the best intentions could\ngo wrong when resources grew tight.\nFen wanted to make absolutely certain that her city didn’t fall—and who\ncould blame her? In her eyes the Shattered Plains were expendable. Yet if\nthey lost the Shattered Plains, Urithiru lost autonomy—the farms, forests,\nand ranching efforts there were essential to supply the city. Jasnah had\nbegun to imagine a new Alethkar at the Shattered Plains—a place for her\npeople outside of Urithiru.\nWithout the Shattered Plains … they’d have to rely on Thaylen City to\nship resources in via Oathgate. Fen promised no tariffs, and Jasnah believed\nher. But what about the merchant council? What about their heirs? She\nshook her head, walking back to her base of operations on this tier—the old\ntemple. Ivory was off secretly listening to Fen report to the Thaylen\nCouncil, accompanied by Brightlord and Brightlady Bethab—Urithiru’s\nambassadors to the city.\nJasnah had sent Ivory because although she trusted Fen as much as she\ntrusted anyone, she’d still like to know exactly what the woman said.

At her\ndesk in the temple, Jasnah began digging out her projections about what\nmight happen at the Shattered Plains. As moving clouds darkened the\nwindows, she fished in her pocket for spheres. Battle was … so much more\nmessy than she’d expected. Why did everyone speak so much of the grand\nexecution of battlefield strategy, if it rarely went as planned?\nThe room grew even darker. Those clouds were—\n“I had hoped,” a soft voice said, “that you wouldn’t realize the ships\nwere empty. When did you send Windrunners to check? Odd, how it’s so\neasy to see anything, yet miss so much.”\nJasnah froze, ice bathing her veins. She looked up, and saw that the\ndarkness falling over the room had come not from clouds, but from a\nshadow cloaking the front of the chamber: a black mist with a strange\ngolden light at the core, tinged red on the outsides. It billowed forward like\nan Everstorm front.\nThe words came from within.\nHer mouth went dry. Fearspren wiggled like globs at her feet, despite her\nbest efforts. “Odium. You cannot touch me. Not without violating your pact\nand opening yourself to attack.”\n“Wit has explained well, I see,” the cloud said. “Do not fear, Jasnah. I’m\nnot here to hurt you, but to compliment you. I was worried you might see\nthrough my ruse with the ships. You have that way about you.”\nJasnah backed away from the table and summoned her armor. It formed\naround her in a flash, clamping into place, pressing her clothing tight.\nOdium couldn’t hurt her directly—Wit was certain of that—but where there\nwas a whitespine, you often found pups. He might not be alone.\n“Jasnah,” Odium said. Was that voice … familiar? “You were right to\nsend your Radiants away. I will take this city, but not by military force.”\nThe dark mists coalesced.\nInto Taravangian.\n“Thaylen City will fall by tomorrow evening,” the figure said. “I’ve\ncome to see to it personally.”\n… In mathematics, we have negative numbers—an impossible\nreality, yet an extremely useful model, as explained by the woman\nwho developed them. Negative one balances with one to create\nzero, both evening out at nothing.\n—From Rhythm of War, first coda, Navani Kholin\nIt was good to be back at the Dustbringer monastery, Szeth thought,\nbreathing in the scent of the pines. He hadn’t realized how much he’d\nmissed this place. An open sky. A refreshing breeze. Ice skating on the\npond.\n… And then he says that he helped build a huge fortress! Nightblood was\nsaying as they walked. A huge one! Big, big, big! And others joined in. They\ndid it even before there were Radiants! Isn’t that deevy? Stoneshaping is\ndeevy.\n“Is that another word of Lift’s?” Szeth said, smiling.\nYup! She knows the best words. They sound so much more fun, don’t they,\nthan regular words? Oh! Do you think we’ll see her tonight at dinner?"

Do you think we’ll see her tonight at dinner?\n“No, sword-nimi,” Szeth said, gently reminding. “She is thousands of\nmiles away. That is a long distance.”\nOh! Right. Right. Deevy. Hey, the swords say they’re almost home. What\ndoes that mean?\nSzeth shook his head and unstrapped his pack. “I don’t know, I’m\nafraid.” Then, speaking louder, he handed the swords to Kaladin. “Take care\nof them. Nin-son-God, do I need to worry about two Honorbearers\nattacking me today?”\n“No,” Nin said. “Your test today is of a different sort. You will face only\none foe.”\n“The former Honorbearer was elderly,” Szeth said. “I assume Gearil-\ndaughter-Gearil has passed? I will face a new, younger Bearer?”\n“Yes,” Nin admitted.\n“Good,” Szeth said, considering his plan. Syl came down from the sky,\nwhere she’d been watching the roadway of spren.\n“It’s so odd up there …” she said, landing—full sized, as she almost\nalways was these days. “Only nature and emotion spren are there. No\nRadiant spren, unbonded or otherwise. They all are still on the other side,\nbut in such quantities it makes the air glow here.”\n“Kaladin, Sylphrena,” Szeth said to them, “I would not like your help\ntoday.”\n“But,” Kaladin said, “if you—”\n“No help, please,” Szeth said.\nNearby, Nin nodded in approval.\n“This is one of my favorite monasteries,” Szeth said, “and a skill at\nwhich I excelled. I … can find my own way here.”\nKaladin reluctantly nodded and took the pack of swords. Szeth turned to\nthe monastery, built in the classic style: a large stone block with slits for\nwindows, standing on a hill in the town, which was dressed up by the\nappealing surroundings and those wonderful trees. But it was just a fortress.\nOne that hadn’t served its function, as it had been corrupted from within.\nSzeth summoned his Shardblade as he walked. “You’ve been quiet\nlately.”\nI’ve been thinking, his spren said.\n“About?”\nAbout what it means to swear oaths, the spren explained. About the best\nway to help you.\n“And?” Szeth asked, stopping in the doorway.\nI think … I need more time.\nIt was remarkable that a highspren should need time to think. Szeth\npeered into the monastery’s grand hall, noting the glowing gemstones on\nthe walls, then the lone figure all the way on the other end. The person—\nfemale, judging by the fit of her grey robes—was swathed in cloth\nwrapping even her head and face.\nSzeth made his decision. He reached to the side and dropped his sword.\nDismissing it.\n“I will not fight you,” he said into the room.\nHe did not look to see Nin’s or Kaladin’s reactions. He was not choosing\neither of their ways. He was … testing his options. That was all. But in one\nthing Kaladin was correct."

But in one\nthing Kaladin was correct.\nWhat Szeth had been doing was destroying him.\n“Szeth,” his spren hissed, forming a rift by his head, “what are you\ndoing?”\n“Something is wrong,” Szeth said. “Something big. How did my people\n—Honorbearers included—allow an Unmade to entice them? Why did no\nothers resist as I did? How did my father, who became grand senator of our\npeople, get taken in? It’s never made any sense to me—and I once decided\nthe only reasonable assumption was that I’d seen things wrong. That I was\nTruthless. Yet Nin names me Truthed. So how could all this have\nhappened?”\nThe figure approached, her Honorblade appearing in her fingers. The\nDustbringer Blade, with a strange slit down the middle and a great deal of\nornamentation around the hilt. Her footsteps left burning imprints in the\nfloor. He’d learned that particular intimidation trick.\n“Szeth!” his spren said. “I really think you should fight!”\n“No one will tell me the truth,” Szeth said. “A pilgrimage, for what?\nWhy do the Honorbearers vanish to smoke when I kill them?”\nThe Dustbringer started running.\n“Szeth!” the spren said. “Szeth!”\n“I am not smart enough to figure out what is happening, but I’m not\ngoing to fight. I’m going to find answers.”\nThe figure reached him, sword out and trailing fire. Another trick to\nintimidate. She drew close enough to swing, and when she did, Szeth\nLashed himself to the side just enough to dodge.\nA set of swings followed, four sweeping attacks, each dodged with his\npowers. She moved in, using the Dustbringer Surges to alter her traction on\nthe ground—sometimes sliding easily, sometimes gaining purchase in an\ninstant and leaping forward with powerful lunges.\nHe dodged them all.\nHe knew these tricks. When she set the air alight, he held his breath, as it\nwasn’t terribly dangerous, no matter how flashy. So much of being a\nDustbringer was about intimidation. True, with the right preparation, she\ncould fill the air in an enclosed space with wood dust and then set it alight\nto create an incredible explosion. But he saw this woman’s tutor in her\nattacks. Flashes and burning motions intended to distract, so that a well-\ntimed sword thrust could do the true damage. If not that, catch them\nunaware and use Division on them directly.\nHe did not fall for the feints. He dodged, sometimes flying, sometimes\nburning the ground or setting wood alight before she could turn it into\nexplosive dust.\n“What is this about?” he asked her softly. “You’re new to this calling.\nNewer, at least. Tell me.”\nShe growled, snapping her fingers, letting fire burn around her in a puff.\nYou could only do that so much, as it drew water from the air, creating a gas\nyou could set alight.

He was beginning to see how much his terrible\nexistence had improved his skills. These Honorbearers, despite their\ntraining, had little practical experience with death and destruction—yet\ndeath and destruction had been Szeth’s life ever since his exile began. He’d\nfound, and fought, his equals in people like Kaladin.\nHe had begun as one of the best that Shinovar had ever created, and he’d\nlong since surpassed that.\n“Fight me,” the woman snapped as he dodged.\nWait.\n“How did you know?” she hissed. “You humiliate me!”\nIt couldn’t be.\nSzeth landed, meeting the Honorbearer’s gaze as she dashed up to him.\nHe formed his Blade in a heartbeat and raised it, absently blocking her\nstrike at his neck. He leaned forward and looked straight into her eyes.\nIt was.\n“I will not fight you,” he whispered. “I will not kill you. Do as you\nmust.”\nHe tossed his sword once more and sat down.\n“Szeth!” his spren cried.\nThe Honorbearer swung for him again, her hands trembling. The Blade\nstopped right before it hit his neck.\nHe met her eyes as she stood there, and he could see the conflict inside.\nShe gathered her strength, gripped the Blade in two hands, and swung yet\nagain—but again she pulled up short before actually striking him.\n“Did they all let me win?” Szeth asked. “Has this all been some sham to\nmake me think I’m accomplishing something?”\n“No, Szeth!” his spren said in his ear. “They’re all supposed to try to kill\nyou!”\nThe figure backed away, grunting softly, then ran toward him again as if\ntrying to force herself to attack. She couldn’t do it though, and drew back,\nstalking around him in a circle.\n“Szeth,” his spren said, “listen to me. You’ve come to the wrong\nconclusion. Something strange is happening, but it’s not what you think.\nThese Honorbearers are supposed to fight you with whatever they have. Do\nyou think being pulled into Shadesmar was a sham?”\n“No,” he agreed. Each of those previous fights had felt desperate to him,\nand at the last monastery someone had tried to knife him in the back. They\nwanted him dead.\nBut this woman … he was right about her. And beyond, he was just so\ntired of the killing.\n“Why?” he asked the figure stalking around him. “Why do you hold\nback?” She yanked the cloth from her head, exposing short-cropped brown\nhair and a face—aged, as his had. Harder. Thicker of neck. Scarred. But so\nfamiliar.\n“Elid,” he said. Evidently his sister had chosen to train, as she’d always\nwanted.\n“Fight me, Szeth!”"

So he leaned forward until she dismissed the\nBlade, and as it vanished to mist, he embraced her.\n“I’m supposed to kill you,” she whispered. “I won my own Blade after\nyou left. To prove I wasn’t weak, I wasn’t Truthless. In the end, your\nleaving wasn’t enough. You still ruined my life.”\n“I’m sorry.”\n“I … am taken by it too,” she said. “The darkness. The Voice. You know\nit?”\n“I do.”\n“I can’t think, Szeth. I didn’t want to think. Why did you drop your\nsword and sit down like that? Why would you ever do that? Even if you\nrecognized my voice, you must know that I was ready to kill you. Why did\nyou trust that I wouldn’t?”\n“I didn’t, Elid. I just decided to be done.”\n“Hell of a time to decide that,” she said, holding to him.\n“An excellent time, actually.”\nHer grip on him tightened. “Listen,” she said. “I feel like years have\npassed in a blink, in a daze. You have to stop it. You have to free us.”\n“How?”\n“I don’t know. But maybe if you do it … if you succeed …”\n“Succeed at what?”\n“They haven’t told you?” She pulled back, and started to unravel.\nTurning to dark mist, dying. “You don’t know?”\n“Know what?” Szeth asked, clinging to her hands. “Why am I here,\nElid?”\n“The Oathpact is broken,” she said, her face distorting. “He’s\nsummoning me, to try to stop me, but I know. The circle is shattered. The\nHeralds degrade. They need someone new. They need … you, Szeth. This\npilgrimage, it’s an audition. Jezrien is dead. And you are to take his—” She\nwent stiff, then completely vanished."

And you are to take his—” She\nwent stiff, then completely vanished.\nHer sword clanged to the ground in the empty monastery, and he was left\nholding air.\n“I had worried about that one,” Nin said from behind. “Ishar said she\nwould be likely to kill you because of her long-building anger. She proved\nto be … weaker than we’d hoped.”\nSzeth turned, livid. “You used my sister against me?”\n“You must be strong,” Nin said, darkening the gateway into the\nmonastery, “to take up this mantle.”\n“To be a Herald?” Szeth said. “Were you going to ask me?”\n“None of us asked for this,” Nin replied. “We did what was needed. As\nyou always have.”\n“It’s true?” Kaladin said, stepping around Nin. “You’re looking for …\nfor another Herald.”\n“To hold back the tide of evil,” Nin said, “the Oathpact must be sure and\nwhole.”\n“Wait,” Syl said, appearing full sized next to Kaladin. “Will a new\nOathpact even do anything? The Fused came back this time because of the\nEverstorm, right?”\n“The Fused Returned because Taln broke,” Nin said. “The Everstorm\nwas brought in, along with gemstones bearing spren, in order to quicken the\nprocess of rebirth—and to make it easier to give forms of power. We do not\nknow what would have happened if Taln had not broken before the\nEverstorm arrived. Ishar explained this to me.”\n“So you don’t know,” Syl said, pointing. “You don’t know that re-\nforming the Oathpact will actually achieve anything. The Everstorm, the\nmethods of physically bringing Voidspren through Shadesmar, might make\nit meaningless.”\n“We must try regardless,” Nin said. “Ishar says the only way to stop the\nFused is to use our souls to lock them away, as part of an oath. If we had a\nnew member, an unparalleled warrior, as Jezrien was—a man with no\nattachments to this world, a man who always does what is needed …”\nSyl folded her arms, and seemed unconvinced. “I thought you wanted\nthe singers to win.”\nSzeth frowned, looking to him, still feeling … warm from his sister’s\nembrace. It was a good question.\nNin cocked his head though. “Why would you have such a wrongheaded\nidea? Why would I want the singers to win? They’re our enemies.”\n“You fight alongside them!” Syl said. “Your Skybreakers side with\nthem!”\n“The singers have the legal precedent,” he said, “and we must follow the\nlaw. But they are our enemies, and I obviously want them to fail.”\n“You uphold them!” Syl said.\n“Nonsense,” Nale said.\nSyl’s mouth worked, her eyes wide, and she looked baffled. Szeth …\nempathized. He’d worked his mind in circles trying to understand morality\nhimself, though he’d assumed a piece of divinity would have an easier time.\nKaladin stepped up next to her, standing just inside the monastery,\nholding the bundle of swords. “Syl …” the Windrunner whispered. “I know"

But it won’t\nwork. You can’t persuade someone delusional with logic.”\nNin sniffed in dismissal of that and glanced at Szeth. “You are ready for\nthis burden?”\nSzeth, numb, shook his head. “Herald,” he whispered. “Me? Are you\ninsane?”\n“I have been told we are,” Nin said, turning. “Come. Two monasteries\nremain. Your father is at the last one.”\n“Elid said our father is dead!” Szeth said.\n“He is. So is your sister. You think you’ve been fighting the living in\nthese monasteries, Szeth? Come now.” He stepped outside.\nDead? He’d been told it before, but he felt sick, cold. Confused.\nKaladin came running up. “Szeth. This …”\n“This is an impossibility,” Szeth said, shoving down the emotions. He\nstarted walking. “What Nin wants from me is an impossibility.”\nAnd yet, Szeth’s own sorry life had taught him that he was a poor judge\nof what was possible and what was not.\nSigzil sat in a meeting within a building on Narak. Rain pelting the stone\nroof.\n“We’ve never fought a battle like this,” Balivar said, sitting at the table\nwith seven others, Sigzil included. Chella the Edgedancer was there, as well\nas Winn. Three other generals, along with Dami—the Stoneward they\nnamed the Stormwall—rounded out the group. Their entire leadership.\n“I don’t like how many losses we’re taking,” said Chella, a woman who\nwore her hair long to flow in the wind. “We’ve lost almost sixty Radiants,\nincluding squires. It horrifies me. Sixty! More casualties than we’ve taken\nover the entire last year.”\n“Is this truly worth it?” Balivar asked. “For some barren rock in a land\nno one cares about?”\n“The Bondsmith told us to hold,” the Stormwall said, crossing arms as\nthick as some people’s thighs. “So we hold.”\n“The Bondsmiths,” Chella said, “put us in command of this battle. We\ncan decide when the costs are too high.”\nThey looked to Sigzil. Who banished the sounds of Leyten dying and sat\nup tall. “What are our options for defense?” he asked the generals.\n“They aren’t great, Brightlord,” Winn said. “We can continue to risk\nWindrunners and Edgedancers to harry those Focused Ones, but we’ve lost\nso many …”\n“Even with the Stonewards resealing cracks and thickening our defenses,\nI fear the enemy powers are too strong for our fortifications,” Balivar\nadded. “The moment we run out of Stormlight, we will fall.”\n“We’ll fall anyway,” said General Habrinar, an old greybeard—who had\nalso been pulled out of retirement. He folded his arms on the table. “We are\noutnumbered, and that disparity grows worse with each loss we take, with\nenemy reinforcements having come via Elsegate. Truth is, I think we’re"

I don’t trust this so-called battle of champions.\nThe enemy has been winning, so why would he agree to such a thing? I\nthink it’s a ruse. It doesn’t make any kind of strategic sense.”\n“That,” the Stormwall said, “is pure conjecture. Dalinar Kholin is one of\nthe greatest military minds Roshar has known. He wouldn’t agree to a\ncontest like this unless it was the right move.”\n“We don’t have to worry about it either way,” Sigzil said, standing up.\n“Our job is this battlefield. We need to last two more days. Does anyone\nhave an idea?”\nThe generals glanced at each other.\n“It’s that bad?” Chella asked.\n“Brightlord Sigzil’s plan to strategically give up plateaus was brilliant,”\nGeneral Rust Elthal said. “But it’s really the only thing that got us this far.\nEspecially without Stormlight, I can think of no way to survive. Brightlord\nSigzil, are you certain the Bondsmiths are unavailable? I have reports of\nBrightness Navani being seen in the hallways.”\n“A ruse, unfortunately,” Sigzil said, with a grimace. “We have to do this\nwith the resources we have—or will soon have. We have Jasnah’s Radiants,\nand my Windrunner colleagues have finished delivering the Mink and his\npeople. They will be here before too long.”\n“More Radiants won’t mean anything if our Stormlight gives out though,\nwill it?” Chella whispered.\n“Still, we must try,” Winn said, looking to Sigzil.\nThe next parts grew technical. How to arrange troops on the two\nremaining plateaus: Narak Prime and Narak Two, the Oathgate plateau. As\nthe meeting finally broke, Sigzil remained behind with General Winn, who\nwas the rare Alethi that was around his height. They stood in the doorway,\nwatching the others retreat through the rain.\n“I want your honest evaluation,” Sigzil said. “What are our chances of\nlasting another two days?”\n“Ten percent, maybe,” Winn said. “With heavy casualties. Brightlord, I’ll\nbe frank. General Habrinar has always been a fatalist, but in this case he’s\nright. Ours is a terrible situation. A normal siege favors the defenders—so\nlong as you don’t run out of food and water, you’re good for long periods.\nBut with the powers the enemy has, and with this storm, and us being\nsurrounded, and our Stormlight low …” He looked to Sigzil. “We are a\ncandle before the storm, Brightlord.”\nSigzil took a deep breath. “I … maybe have an idea.”\n“Thank the Heralds,” Winn whispered. “What? Why didn’t you mention\nit at the meeting?”\n“I wanted to see if anyone had anything better,” Sigzil said. “Because I\nhaven’t completely worked out the details of mine. It seems like it might be\nimpossible. But Vienta and I have been looking over the fine points of the\nagreement between Dalinar and Odium, and … maybe we have something.\nI need more time.”"

But Vienta and I have been looking over the fine points of the\nagreement between Dalinar and Odium, and … maybe we have something.\nI need more time.”\n“Then we will give it to you,” Winn said.\nHe saluted and walked off into the rain, more of a spring in his aged step.\n“Storms,” Vienta whispered. “Sigzil, this idea … it can’t work. I can’t\nsee how we could possibly trick the Fused into following us off the\nplateau.”\nHe thought maybe he could trick them into abandoning it completely—\nfollowing his army into the rain, so that when the deadline came, the enemy\ndidn’t hold the plateau. She was right though; they wouldn’t be diverted\nthat far.\nBut there was something here … He felt he could crack this. Storms,\nhe’d come here to lead, and found he was actually good at it when he\nstopped worrying so much about what people thought of him.\nHe wanted to bring that to fruition and save the place. He wanted\nLeyten’s death—still a raw wound inside—to mean something. He wanted\nto live up to the trust they all had in him.\n“We have to make this work, Vienta,” he said. “It’s our job.”\n“I’m sorry,” she replied, invisible. “I’ve not been a good spren lately. I\n…”\n“It’s all right,” Sigzil said. “You’ve been extremely helpful. How are you\nfeeling?”\n“I keep hearing Ethenia scream,” she whispered. “We aren’t supposed to\nbe able to die, Sigzil. We’re the wind and the heart of Honor itself. If we\ncan die … what does that mean? That even Honor, the winds, the planet\nitself can just … end?”\nHe wasn’t a philosopher, as much as his master Hoid had tried, so he had\nno answer. He merely stood there, looking out through the rain.\nRocks sang as Venli and the others reached the end of the tunnel. They\nfound a magnificent golden pool of light.\nAwespren burst around them, six of them, floating blue balls that\nexpanded as they faded into nothing.\nThis pool was hidden in a rocky cavern with no exits, directly beneath\nthe main Narak plateau. Thirty yards or more wide, it glowed, shimmering\nand brilliant. The liquid seemed thicker than ordinary water, and it rippled\nas Thude knelt and tapped it with his axe.\nIt was the source of the sound.\n“What is it?” Bila asked to Awe.\nTimbre pulsed an explanation.\n“Timbre has seen a pool like this,” Venli said. “In the mountains. The\nFused use it as a gateway to another realm. They always called it\nCultivation’s pool. The greatest of the gods create them, and Timbre says\nshe thinks … it gathers for the same reason Stormlight streams off a\nhuman.”\n“All three have one of these?” Thude asked, dipping his axe again.\n“Honor, Cultivation, and Odium?”\n“Honor’s pool moves around,” Venli said. “No one knows where\nOdium’s is. At least … no one did. The Fused talked about it, that Odium\ndoesn’t trust anyone to know its location, after an event they wouldn’t\nspeak of.”"

The Fused talked about it, that Odium\ndoesn’t trust anyone to know its location, after an event they wouldn’t\nspeak of.”\nIt had been hidden, at least until now. Until …\nUntil, Timbre guessed, someone arrived who was bonded to both a spren\nof Odium and a spren of Honor. Venli. Had Odium somehow masked his\npool using Honor? Or was it something else? What had the stones said …\nPieces of the sky, fallen here. Watched over by strange people. Secrets\neven the gods didn’t understand.\nChasmfiends had always been capable of hearing it. That was what led\nthem to this region to pupate. The ancient singers had unwittingly followed\nit here too, before it had been hidden. When the Everstorm and highstorm\nhad clashed, this pool had fueled their explosive destruction. Most\nimportantly, the power here—and the bits of fallen sky—had somehow\nbeen involved in the destruction of a city and a people.\nOdium wanted to hold this portion of land at all costs. Rlain’s\ndescription of the contest explained so much—and she wished he hadn’t\nstopped answering. Because she could see why the war above was so\nfearsome, why the Everstorm was here.\nOdium had brought his best to protect this pool. Venli attuned the\nTerrors. What on Roshar were they going to do with such knowledge?\nThude foolishly reached out to touch the power, but Bila held him back.\nTogether they stared at it, golden light reflecting in their eyes.\nBefore they could make a decision, one of the guards came stumbling\ndown through the tunnel. “Our Heavenly Ones have been discovered.”\n“By which side?” Venli asked, anxious.\n“The singers,” he said. “And by some kind of extremely dangerous-\nlooking Fused.”\nThis is closer to the interactions of Light and anti-Light, yet I do\nnot fully accept it as the proper parallel either.\n—From Rhythm of War, first coda, Navani Kholin\nDalinar jolted, his muscles coming alert, like the nervous shocks that\nhappened when on the cusp of sleep. He found himself standing in front of\na mirror.\nElhokar stared back at him.\nWait, Dalinar thought. Why do I see Elhokar? He raised his hands and\nchecked. Yes, he was in his nephew’s body, but for some reason saw\nElhokar’s features instead of his own. Why? Storms, it broke Dalinar’s\nheart anew to see Elhokar just as he remembered him. In uniform, with\nthose distinctive features, vaguely reminiscent of his father. A boy Dalinar\nloved like his own son.\nHad there been a way to save the lad? What had Dalinar been thinking,\nsending him to Kholinar with only a small group of guards? Should Dalinar\nhimself have gone? He tried checking the clock on his arm, but it wasn’t\nthere—perhaps since Elhokar wouldn’t have been wearing it. Where was\nNavani? He hadn’t been able to find her in … how long had it been?

He\nspun, but saw nothing. “Show yourselves!” he demanded of the seemingly\nempty room. “What is it you want?”\nWe seek … truth …\nDalinar jumped. That wasn’t the voice of Odium, or Honor. That\nsounded like … a Cryptic? Storms. Wit had said Elhokar had been on the\npath to Radiance. Dalinar had always underestimated this man, hadn’t he?\nA knock on the door, and Elhokar’s armorers entered at his call. That\nwould have been odd for most, but during this time Elhokar had been\nparanoid, often commanding the armorers to suit him up for everyday\nactivities. Dalinar allowed them to do so now, looking around the room,\nremembering his nephew. They were in the Pinnacle, Elhokar’s seat at the\nwarcamps. Dalinar had been here many times.\nShardplate donned, he dismissed the armorers. There were some maps\non the table, a scattered mess. His nephew had been irritable and nervous\nduring these days—but he could see now that perhaps the lad had been\nhaunted by Cryptics. Deep inside, Dalinar felt … what Elhokar must have.\nHis frustration at not being believed—and his worry that he was mad,\nseeing things like Dalinar had. So many uncertain thoughts, mixing with a\ndesire to live up to his father’s name.\nIt was as if he could sense Elhokar’s growing understanding that he was\na weak king—and that drove him to wish that he could be like the\nBlackthorn. The new Blackthorn. The man Dalinar had become. Elhokar\nrespected him so much, but he didn’t know how to deal with the scheming\nhighprinces, the expectations, the fear that he was losing his mind. It was all\nso overwhelming.\nThere were rumors about Dalinar and Elhokar’s mother. Dalinar sensed\nthat Elhokar had wanted to broach the topic, to project strength. Yet he was\nalso so uncertain. Would that make Dalinar angry, or proud of his nephew’s\nproactivity?\nStorms. That impression of his nephew’s thoughts—something new to\nthese visions, and only faintly noticeable—left Dalinar cold. The lad had\nneeded someone who understood. Someone to listen.\nInstead, the door opened and Dalinar Kholin entered the room, thunder\nin his expression. And the older Dalinar now recognized this day—from not\neven two years ago, yet he was so very different. This wasn’t the drunkard.\nThis Dalinar had been starting on his path to Radiance, but he continued to\nsolve things in only one way. One blunt, terrible way.\nOlder Dalinar realized … he was still that man. In the vision previous,\nhow had he responded to his younger self? By slapping him silly.\n“Do we have to do this?” Dalinar asked his younger self, looking him in\nthe eyes.\n“Yes,” younger Dalinar growled, before raising one leg and kicking\nDalinar in the chest. His immediate response was fury. Once again he could\nfeel—as a hint deep within—his nephew’s emotions. Elhokar’s confusion,\npanic, and pain."

Elhokar’s confusion,\npanic, and pain.\nOn top of that was Dalinar’s own sense of indignation. This younger\nversion of him was going to secure the kingdom, but in the process would\ndrive Elhokar to further bouts of insecurity. Insecurity that would cause him\nto demand he lead the mission to Kholinar, where he’d be killed.\nThe sad truth was that despite his accomplishments, Dalinar had\nconsolidated power by killing or removing the highprinces who didn’t agree\nwith him. He’d taken a proud nation of warriors, eliminated all balances\nupon a monarch’s powers, completely broken the ruling class, and installed\nhimself as a despot at the top. For the good of the world.\nHe could almost hear Taravangian, dead these few weeks, whispering to\nhim. You see. The monarch must do what needs to be done. Regardless of\nthe consequences. You’ve always known that, Dalinar …\nHe didn’t know that he could have taken any other action to protect the\nworld, but that didn’t stop him—in the moment—from being furious with\nthis younger version of himself. And so he fought back. After falling from\nthat initial kick, he dodged younger Dalinar’s follow-up attack, moving\nfaster than Elhokar had in the original clash. He grabbed the table, smashed\nit against young Dalinar, and then came in swinging, pounding gauntlets\ninto young Dalinar’s chest.\nIt wasn’t the best strategy, gauntlet against breastplate, as it cracked both\npieces equally. Dalinar didn’t care. This wasn’t real, but his anger was.\nYounger Dalinar growled, knocking Dalinar’s arms away, then rushing\nhim with a shoulder, slamming him backward. Old Dalinar broke through\nfurniture, stumbling away, but then launched into a grapple as younger\nDalinar drew closer. But that risked their heads—which were exposed, so\nhe let younger Dalinar push him away.\n“Are you surprised?” younger Dalinar said. “No, you expected this.\nStorms, Elhokar.”\nDalinar didn’t reply, arms raised in a boxing posture, Stormlight faintly\nleaking from cracks in his gauntlets. Younger Dalinar tested him, and\nDalinar blocked his strikes with his forearms, then delivered two solid\npunches to the man’s chest, further cracking their armor.\n“You’ve been practicing,” younger Dalinar said, rounding him. “When\ndid you get so good at boxing?”\nDalinar didn’t respond. What did he care? The visions were playing with\nhim; maybe he shouldn’t be rising to the bait. Still, his anger flared as\nyounger Dalinar came in, and storms … Dalinar wasn’t as fit as he’d been\neven two years ago. Back then, he’d gone on regular plateau assaults.\nAfter all this time being a king and a general—having given his Plate to\nRenarin—Dalinar could not keep up. Eventually, younger Dalinar forced\nhim to stumble, then delivered an expert heel-first kick and cracked\nDalinar’s breastplate. He could feel Elhokar’s emotions.

He … he will be a stronger king.\n“No, Elhokar,” Dalinar whispered. “The failure is mine. It will take your\ndeath to teach me that.”\nYounger Dalinar came in, relentless. He’d thought, in that thick-skulled\nhead of his, that the only way to prove he wasn’t a threat was to get into a\nposition where he could easily kill Elhokar, then walk away. Because\nyounger Dalinar was fully incapable of sitting down and sincerely trying to\nlisten.\nI can’t beat him alone, Dalinar thought. But perhaps I can outthink him.\nThis younger him had let Sadeas play him, nearly getting his entire army\nkilled.\nDalinar launched himself across the room, dodged an attack, then kicked\nthe door down. “The Blackthorn has gone mad from his strange visions!” he\nshouted to the panicked guards outside. “He’s trying to kill me and take the\nthrone!”\nYounger Dalinar pulled him back into the room and threw him to the\nfloor. Then, the younger him leaned down and smashed his fist into\nDalinar’s breastplate—shattering it in an explosion of glowing bits of metal.\nThat did it. Without the breastplate, which held the majority of the\ngemstones, Plate had trouble drawing power. The other parts felt leaden\naround him, difficult to lift. Dalinar let his head rest back, lying face-up on\nthe floor.\n“You cut your own straps, didn’t you?” younger Dalinar said. “On the\nhorse? You faked an assassination attempt.”\nDalinar didn’t respond, instead turning toward the guards.\n“They’re my men,” younger Dalinar said. “They won’t help you,\nElhokar. They’ve always been my men.”\nExcept one of them … one of them was truly horrified. From his\nexpression Dalinar knew it was little Gav. Watching. Witnessing. Storms,\nhe’d just seen Dalinar—younger Dalinar, but he wouldn’t know the\ndifference—beat his father. Because if Dalinar saw Gav as a soldier, Gav—\nin turn—would see Elhokar on the floor here.\nStorms … this vision was different by intent, wasn’t it? It was\ndeliberately showing Gav what had happened. Odium wanted Gav to\nwitness Dalinar nearly killing his father.\nGav reached toward him with tears in his eyes.\n“I didn’t mean to hurt him, son,” Dalinar said. “I was just trying … my\nbest …”\nBut before he could explain further, the vision ended.

Maybe more information would help. It sometimes\ndid. Not as often as she wished, but she usually craved it anyway.\n“How?” she asked through dry lips.\n“Szeth came to kill me bearing the sword that bleeds darkness,”\nTaravangian said, standing at the opening into the small temple. “I had been\ninteracting with the previous Odium, and the sword became available at\nexactly the right time. I availed myself of the opportunity, slew Rayse, and\nAscended.” He spread his hands to the sides. “It was Cultivation’s fault and\nplan. I am, like Roshar itself, a dupe in a larger game.”\nStorms, it really did seem like him. She couldn’t know for certain, but\nthere was little you could know for certain.

Wit had explained some things, like that power needed a person to\nhold it. Taravangian had Ascended not to actual Godhood, but to lowercase\ngodhood, a word Wit employed for a being of immense power. She\naccepted that definition as a useful description.\nShe had no idea what to do. Despite sharing a bed with Wit—who was\nlike one of these creatures—she was overwhelmed by the idea of dealing\nwith them. Inside, she trembled.\n“I come with an offer,” Taravangian said. “I am speaking to Fen now; the\nability to be in more than one place at once is an advantage of my elevated\nstatus. She doesn’t believe that I am me, by the way. She’s much less\nlogical than you are.”\n“I don’t entirely believe you either.”\n“You believe enough,” Taravangian said, stopping near her, looking up\nto meet her eyes. Even in this form, he was shorter than she was. “Because\nwhy would I lie? There is nothing to gain from it. You wouldn’t trust\nTaravangian any more than you would Rayse. A scholar knows; I reveal\nmyself not for advantage, but as a courtesy. For our upcoming duel.”\n“You cannot hurt me.”\n“It will not be a duel of swords, Jasnah,” he said. “My predecessor … he\nworked so hard to recruit his opponents. Alas, he did so by pushing.”\nTaravangian extended his hand to her. “I intend to do it with a gentle tug\ninstead.”\nShe did not take the hand."

Alas, he did so by pushing.”\nTaravangian extended his hand to her. “I intend to do it with a gentle tug\ninstead.”\nShe did not take the hand.\nHe smiled anyway. “Tomorrow I will argue to Queen Fen why she and\nher people should join me willingly and become part of the larger reborn\nDawnsinger nation. I invite you to offer counterargument. It is your\nspecialty, is it not?”\n“I … You’re going to try to recruit Thaylenah?”\n“A gentle tug,” he said, turning to go. He paused, and glanced back at\nher. “I do know how to shove too, but one should always try to lead people\nto the proper decisions first. Prepare your arguments well, Jasnah. I am\ncurious to hear what you come up with to convince Fen to stay with you\nand your fallen kingdom, instead of joining the side already proven\nvictorious. By the end, you’ll see. You’ll understand.”\nHe started evaporating into that mist again.\n“See you soon,” his voice said as his body disintegrated. “I hope you\ndon’t waste too much of your time wondering if this is a trick. Just don’t\nforget to prepare your arguments. Then meet me here in this room, exactly\none day from now.”\nWith that, he was gone.\nVenli had never seen a Fused like this before. Tall, with magnificent metal\nhorns—and with his carapace somehow transformed to shimmering steel. It\nlooked violent, but with an artistic touch, all smooth lines until the bits\ncame to points here and there. What brand was this? She couldn’t tell;\nperhaps whatever was going on with the carapace obscured his true nature.\nShe and the others had hurriedly returned to the chasms, sealing up the\nway below. In a stroke of luck, leaving the Heavenly Ones behind had been\nprecisely the right move—for while Leshwi and the chasmfiends had been\ndiscovered, they had distracted the enemy long enough for Venli and the\nothers to escape the tunnel without it or them being seen.\nSoon after, Venli’s group had been spotted as well—then herded\ntogether. She, still in envoyform—a form of power, a Regal—had been\nbrought forward. Now, two Heavenly Ones—not of Leshwi’s force—\ndeposited her on a plateau a short distance from the fighting. Shrouded in\ndarkness by the omnipresent clouds, occasionally painted red with\nlightning, she inspected the strange Fused. Leshwi and the other rebel\nHeavenly Ones knelt before him. Humming to Agony. Trembling.\nVenli found herself unafraid.\nHow curious. Timbre pulsed inside her, and she realized she’d faced\nOdium himself. This Fused might destroy her, but to the Rhythm of the\nLost, a phrase repeated in her mind:\nI am my own. Not his.\n“And here,” the Fused said, completely without rhythm, “the ringleader\nherself. Once Odium’s own Voice. Venli, Last Listener. Welcome.”\nShe had not expected politeness. So, she hummed to him in greeting.\nThe Heavenly Ones who had brought her backed away, leaving the group lit\nby a few gemstones on the ground, wet from previous rain—though that"

In the Everstorm, it came in fits and starts.\n“It is unusual,” this Fused said, walking around Leshwi and the others as\nthey knelt, “to find those who rebel against Odium. Some think it\nimpossible, but it does happen.” He looked to Venli. “Often it is a mark of\nour best.”\n“I would not have expected you to say such a thing.”\n“Who else would have the force of will, or the courage, to turn against a\ngod?” asked the strange Fused. “Odium’s predecessor always stamped them\nout. What a waste. If we cull ourselves of our strongest wills, what is left?”\nHe glanced to the side, where a Husked One sat back, staring at the sky.\nMotionless.\nVenli had seen this happen in Kholinar. Fused who just … stopped\nmoving. Stopped thinking. A price paid for thousands of years of life, much\nof it spent at war.\n“What are you going to do with us?” Venli asked.\n“I give you an offer,” the Fused replied. “I would appreciate your\nloyalty. You see, I am … of a different mindset than others. I finally have a\ngod to follow who shares my tendencies. You will not be punished for\nrebellion. Instead you will be elevated.” He smiled. “You will be made\nFused, Venli. These will be pardoned, and given the greatest rewards. For I\nneed the edge you provide.”\nEdge? She frowned.\n“We need to defeat the humans,” the Fused said, pointing. “And you\nhave brought me something extremely interesting. Captive greatshells who\nsomehow follow you.”\nTimbre pulsed to a worried rhythm. The guard had said the chasmfiends\nhad fled, and the enemy warriors had focused only on capturing Leshwi and\nher Fused. But he knew?\nLeshwi looked to her and bowed her head. She had revealed the truth of\nthe chasmfiends, then.\n“I must speak to the others,” Venli said. “You will give me time to make\na decision.”\n“You make demands?” he said.\n“Is this not a negotiation?” Venli asked. “I have looked Odium in the\neye. I know he could have you destroy me upon a whim. But if you seek us\nas allies, then I believe it my right to have time to consider.”\n“How satisfying. Go. Do not interfere in this fight yet. You will be\nwatched, but you will be given time.” He turned his gaze toward the sky. “I\nwill have this land tomorrow, one way or another. And understand this is a\nthreat: we know of your people at the edge of the plateaus. Odium plans to\ndeal with them soon. My offer … is survival, Last Listener. Do not dismiss\nit lightly.”\nHe clapped his hands and released Leshwi and the others. They—bowing\n—hurried over and joined Venli. Leshwi herself took Venli by the arm and\nbegan flying her down into the chasms."

She hadn’t heard the name. “What title?”\n“No title.”\n“That’s odd, isn’t it?”\n“He is the only one,” Leshwi whispered. “He is … not to be trifled with.\nBut if he’s willing to pardon us … this could be our way out. Our way to\nprotect the listeners.”\n“The last time I put any of my people in Odium’s power,” Venli said as\nthey landed, “it did not go well. I do not trust his offers.”\n“El says there is a new Odium, remade,” Leshwi said. “An incredible\nevent, one I cannot even begin to fathom. Yet El promises it can be\ndifferent. He rarely lies.”\nVenli attuned Skepticism, but once she had rejoined the others, they\ncalled the chasmfiends back to join them. The beasts were allowed to\napproach beneath the careful watch of Odium’s forces, who had made a\nspace for them all in a large gap between plateaus. Here, with the others,\nshe sat and told them the disturbing news.

But first …\nWind embraced him. A powerful, high wind that churned and buffeted. A\nwind born of angrier places, beyond the mountains. Today, he loved the way\nit enveloped him, reminding him how small he was. He’d begun to think\nhimself grand. But the wind needed no Stormlight to blow. The wind was\nits own Surge, monarch of a realm that Szeth visited only with its\npermission.\nThere was a liberation in being small. Whatever he did, no matter what\nhe broke or ruined, Szeth was insignificant compared to the wind. He\nsoared high. No. Tuko had spoken of the need to keep proper perspective.\nSzeth didn’t soar, he Lashed. The sky became down for him, and he fell\nwith increasing speed upward, into the heavens. Dropping, not flying, like a\nstone. Sent spinning, twirling, cast into the wind to fall.\nFall …\nFall …\nAlmost he could imagine falling forever, away from this land with its\ncomplicated questions, up through an infinite invisible embrace. It got\ncolder the higher you went, and the air grew thin. But what was air to\nSzeth? He didn’t need to breathe any longer.\nFalling …\nFalling …\nThrough clouds. Drawing in more Stormlight. Bursting into the expanse\nbeyond, mysterious as the greatest depths of the ocean. Still Szeth fell into\nthe blue. Which darkened.\nThe air failed.

He hadn’t risen so high that the ground let go of him, not by\nfar. He hung for a moment, twisting in that all-dominating blue that faded to\nblack. The land below was covered in a veil of white clouds. Lit by the sun,\nso distant yet.\nSzeth fell back down. Dropping in the other direction, the wind building.\nWhen he used his powers, that buffeting was lessened—but he didn’t use\nthem now. Soon the wind was a roar, shouting in glee at his return.\nDown Szeth fell, until the city became visible. Ayabiza, the place of\nlanding, the name suddenly appropriate. The Bondsmith monastery was half\na day’s walk beyond it, in the rocky portions of the highlands. Reluctantly,\nhe Lashed himself upward—slowing his fall until he landed in the central\nsquare of the city with a crash of expanding Stormlight. Wooden paving\nboards rattled underfoot, then he stood up among startled marketgoers.\nA true city, the most ancient on Roshar. Built by both those who touched\nstone and those who didn’t. Both were needed, like shepherd and sheep.\nTall buildings, mostly of clay, reinforced by wood. Painted in bright colors,\nmurals on every wall, for in Ayabiza buildings could have as much a splash\nas anyone gave them.\nHe’d always wanted to visit this city, but the Bondsmith monastery\nwasn’t part of the pilgrimage. You didn’t fight that Honorbearer, or train\nwith their strange powers. So he’d never had the time.\nToday, he strolled down the boarded walkway, nodding to locals who\nbowed in deference. He should have gone straight to meet the Voice, yet he\ndelayed. He knew that once he took that step, his life would change again.\nFirst, this Voice had stolen the grasslands from him, then it had stolen his\ninnocence, then finally it had ascended him to master of wind and Truth.\nThe next step … Szeth dared not guess.\nThe city was enormous. So many wonderful murals, each brightly\ncolored. So many people, swathed in brilliant splashes. The famous sewer\nsystem, built following an ancient Herald’s design. Hanging gardens on\neach building so vines could grow down, letting the land add its splash to\nthe paintings. It was more brilliant than he’d even imagined. Yes, this was\nworth fighting for. For this, he prepared for the coming of the End of All\nThings.\nHe traded empty gemstones with a local foreign merchant for full ones,\nthen took to the sky once more.\nIt was time.\nInstead, I find the closest model to be that of destructive\ninterference in sound.

She\nhad to see and accept what Veil had once seen and accepted for her.\nIt was time to visit that day.\nIt formed around her—and oh, how she missed the chaos of the Spiritual\nRealm. So much better was possibility than reality. She could have spent an\neternity surrounded by figures from the past and future, made as if from\nflowing paint and mist. Instead she came here. To the Davar estate.\nShe’d been eleven.\nShe appeared in her adult body—not the child’s body whose perspective\nhad once shaped her view of the world. Always forced to look up. Always\nknowing everyone else was so much stronger than she was. And therefore\n—she’d believed—wiser.\nShe was in her room. A small chamber with fluffy white carpet. She’d\nloved to roll on that carpet, feel it tickle her cheek, then her neck, then her\nother cheek. Near one wall was her trunk, and in that—hidden poorly—her\ndrawings.\nThey weren’t good. She wasn’t an artist yet, and wouldn’t truly start to\nbecome one until Helaran brought her supplies in the future. But she had …\nStrength, Veil thought.\n… but she had spent time in the gardens with Testament. Exploring her\npowers, and saying truths.\nShe opened the door and walked the memory, where light streaming\nthrough windows looked too golden, the colors of the wood trim too rich. In\nthe hallway she glanced out a window into the gardens, and saw a young\ngirl with a freckled face and a white gown.\nShe was surrounded by shivering vines, the type that poured down walls\nlike waterfalls in this part of Jah Keved, glittering with glowing lifespren.\nThe air smelled of life—a faintly grassy scent, mixed with the dampness of\nwater standing in pools from the recent rainfall. Young Shallan had felt safe\nhere. Just her, the plants, the lifespren, and Testament.\nThe stone bench in front of the young Shallan—kept clean from crem\nbut growing lichen along its legs—was dimpled with Testament’s shape.\n“I’m afraid,” young Shallan said.\n“Why, Shallan?”\nOlder Shallan raised her head sharply, hearing Testament’s calm, wise\nvoice. The way it had been. Storms, that sound struck something inside\nShallan. The memory seemed to become more real in that moment.\n“Because,” young her whispered, “I don’t want anything to change, and\nit will. I hate the future. I’m scared of it.”\n“A truth,” Testament responded, “that I will hold dear, Shallan.” The\nplants moved and writhed, twisting across the ground, forming a symbol out\nof greenery with young Shallan at the heart of it.\n“Why?” adult Shallan said. “Why would you let a girl of eleven swear\nthe oaths? I was too young.”\nTestament felt, Pattern said in her mind, that starting with a child who\nhad no preconceptions would be better for inspiring a new generation of\nRadiants.

And then … there was the other reason you drew our attention …\nAdult Shallan turned as the young Shallan stood up, gathering Testament\non her dress, and snuck into the house. Always sneaking about, always\nlistening. Shallan followed until they reached the door to her mother’s\nroom. On the other side, Mother’s voice, speaking with a man who was\nvisiting from far away, a man the servants whispered must be her lover.\nYoung Shallan listened at the door, terrified, hoping to find it wasn’t\ntrue. Adult Shallan simply strode past her and pushed the door open.\nMother was there, pacing, wearing a beautiful blue and gold dress. In\nthat moment Shallan remembered her companion in crisp detail: a foreigner\nwho wore the Skybreaker symbol on his sleeve. He carried a box with a\nglowing light inside, like the one that Shallan had used to communicate\nwith Mraize while in the Cognitive Realm. A sphere rose from it and\nformed a face. A face she knew from art and description.\nNale—Nalan’Elin, the Herald.\n“Chana,” he said. “I need you to join Kalak and myself in Kholinar. Our\nwork grows more difficult.”\nNale.\nKalak.\nChana.\n“It’s true,” Shallan whispered, tears forming at the corners of her eyes.\nYes, Pattern said. I’m sorry.\nThey didn’t seem to be able to see the adult her; no one reacted to her.\nIndeed, young Shallan kept kneeling outside, listening as if the door were\nclosed.\n“Chana,” Nale continued, his voice cool and emotionless as the glowing\nface spoke, “you’re being unreasonable. This entire endeavor of yours was\nunreasonable.”\n“I wanted a life again,” Mother snapped. “I fell in love.”\n“You found a dupe.”\nMother growled. Literally growled. She stalked across the room toward\nthe Skybreaker, and he stepped back, alarm blooming on his face, keeping\nbehind the glowing sphere as if to defend himself or ward her away.\nShallan watched, transfixed. That … wasn’t how she remembered her\nmother, who had been so sweet, so overtly feminine. Here, she wasn’t even\nwearing a glove.\n“He loves me, Nale,” Mother growled. “I have a family.”\n“And where has that led you?” the voice said, calm. “To this? And the\nchild? What of Shallan?”\nMother turned away. Shallan walked between them, looking from one to\nthe other.\n“She is one of them,” Mother said.\n“Yes,” Nale said. “Which means …”\nMother didn’t respond.\n“Dreder will kill her if you do not,” said Nale. “We have legal\njustification, by the Veden Voidcraft Act, to punish those who seek such\npowers—as you well know. Kill her. Those are my orders.” Then his face\nsmoothed out to the round seon spren, which returned to its box.\nYoung Shallan—still listening at the doorway—gasped, then pulled\naway.

Testament had realized the danger, and whispered to Shallan that they\nneeded to escape. Young Shallan scurried away, back to her rooms, where\nshe’d begun gathering things to flee.\nOlder Shallan waited in this room, stabbed through with a variety of\npains. One would think her a connoisseur of pain by now, as she could\nname the different types. She wiped the tears from her eyes, recognizing\nbetrayal—its own distinct flavor—mixed with the confused agony of seeing\nher mother again and the strangely poignant pain of discovery.\nThe Skybreaker … Dreder … set aside the box. “All but your husband’s\nbastard bear a terrible burden, including predispositions inherited from you.\nNale says you were warned it would happen. Chana … killing the child\nnow will be a mercy.”\n“You don’t understand,” Mother whispered. “She’ll come back, Dreder.\nOnce I kill her, she’ll return to life. She’s taking my place.”\n“What nonsense is this?”\n“Shallan has powers,” Mother said, “but the Radiants are dead and gone.\nThis means that I’ve found what I was searching for: an heir. The bond has\npassed from me to her. She is eternal now and I am mortal.”\n“Chana,” Dreder said, “I’m no Herald, but even I know Bondsmithing\nwell enough to know you can’t give away your bond to the Oathpact.”\n“I’ve already done it,” Chana said. “You’ll see. Shallan will be reborn,\nand then … then I’ll be free.” Mother looked to the side, and met the older\nShallan’s eyes. “You’ll do better than I could, Shallan.”\n“You’re insane,” Dreder said softly. “Only Nale remains unscathed. But\nvery well. Prove it to me. Kill the child, and let her return. I will report this\nnews to my lord Herald and the other Skybreakers.”\nHe just wanted a budding Radiant eliminated—as had been the\nSkybreaker pattern for centuries. Mother held Shallan’s eyes, then stalked\naway with a bearing that young Shallan had never seen. Confident, strong\nas a warrior in battle.\nDreder sighed and followed. “Nasty business,” he said to himself. “I hate\nit when they’re children …”\nShallan, cold, trailed after them. She couldn’t watch this, could she? She\n…\nYes, you can, Veil said.\nYes, you can, Radiant said.\nShe could. She followed them down the hallway, and felt something\nchanging in her. The pains were still there, but they had dulled, the barbs no\nlonger razor sharp.\nHer mother had not been well. Obviously. That didn’t excuse her actions,\nbut somehow seeing it … seeing it and confronting it helped.\nShallan stopped at her childhood room, but young Shallan wasn’t there.\nThat’s right.

Is that new? Shallan demanded. Did that\nactually happen? Or is it a change because it’s what I want to see?\nI do not know, Pattern said. I’m sorry.\nIt … Testament’s voice, weak but audible. It happened. She paused.\nAdult Shallan collapsed to her knees beside the two. Mother knelt there,\nknife out and ready, emotions of her own warring on her face. Anger,\ndetermination … then …\nHer face softened. She did not strike.\nA sword appeared in young Shallan’s hands, materializing out of white\nmist. She rammed it up through her mother’s chest, and Chana’s eyes\nburned.\nDreder shouted, reaching for her. His eyes burned next, and he fell\nfacedown.\nMother somehow lasted a moment, mouth moving, eyes black—before\nslumping down onto the crying child.

This terrible day.\nThe day the world had ended.\nAnd Shallan was to blame.\nIn the farthest reaches of her mind, she heard that same child’s voice\ncrying. Nestled in her head. Not new.\nI’ve protected her all this time, Veil whispered. It’s all right. She’s safe.\nShe always has been.\nShallan wiped her tears. Storms. She was through it. She’d watched it.\nShe’d survived. Emotions still made a mess of her, but a budding\nknowledge—reinforced by experience—emerged like a powerful light from\nwithin.\nShe could do this.\nShe had already done it. She’d survived it as a child—the only way she\nknew how, but even then she’d been strong.\nShe forced herself to turn back and watch. The Shardblade hadn’t\nvanished to mist, but young Shallan wouldn’t look at it. Whispering self-\nhatred, she had begun renouncing her oaths in this moment, though it\nwouldn’t fully happen until the next day, in the garden, when she was more\nlucid and capable of truly doing so.\n“I hate you,” young Shallan would say. “I’m done.”"

Memories of what she had done to a dear\nfriend.\nDoes it hurt? Shallan asked Testament.\nYes, Testament said. But … sometimes … pain is required …\nShallan took a deep breath, and opened her eyes. Father, surrounded by\nshockspren, pushed himself up from the floor.\nShallan? Pattern said in her mind. Are you … are you all right?\nI can handle it, she replied.\nWe worried it would break you, he said. I think the Spiritual Realm itself\nwants to show you things that hurt.\n“It never broke me,” Shallan said. “It merely cracked me, Pattern. I filled\nthose cracks.” She took another deep breath, shuddering. “I’m glad to\nremember.”\nThere will be more emotion to come, Radiant said. But when it comes,\nwe’ll be here to help.\nFather put the Shardblade in his safe, then gently wiped the blood from\nthe young Shallan’s face. She felt anger at seeing him be so tender, as his\ntemperament had always been erratic at best, abusive at worst. This moment\nwould shatter their family.\nShould she blame herself? Could she? Could anyone actually blame the\nyoung girl trembling in her father’s arms?\nNo. She had to blame her mother, because her mother was to blame. The\nhesitation was to Mother’s credit, and Mother’s insanity provided context.\nBut context didn’t excuse actions, only helped give reasons for them. A\nchild had the right to defend herself, and the hesitation had not been a\ncomplete halt to the violence. Adult Shallan knelt beside her mother’s fallen\ncorpse. How did she feel about this woman now? Still angry, yes. Still\nangry.\nYou don’t have to forgive her, Testament said. What she did was terrible.\nI don’t have to, Shallan replied. But I want to.\nFather began singing his lullaby. Shallan knelt there, suddenly drained.\nThere was … more. More she had to do. More she wanted to do.\nAre we … just going to ignore … that you’re the daughter of a Herald?\nPattern said. Shallan, Heralds are like spren—they don’t die permanently,\nnot even by Shardblades.

Only someone very profane\n—or extremely holy—could walk here. In the past, there had been ten who\nfit both descriptions. Szeth knelt and touched one of the slots in the stone,\nstill present after thousands of years, kept clean by the shamans. He’d\nexpected to find a few of them here today, but the place was empty.\nSzeth reverenced each of the stone divots in turn, the sheaths for the\nHonorblades when they’d been gifted to the Shin for safekeeping. He went\nthrough all …\n… all nine. That was right. He felt a fool for imagining ten people\nearlier. Had he forgotten his lessons so easily? He paused at the blank\nsection of stone where Talmut’s Blade would have been placed, and kissed\nthe ground there. It was the first time his lips had touched stone.\nForehead against the rock, he prayed silently to Talmut. The one who\nhad chosen to remain in Damnation so that his brothers and sisters—and all\nhumankind—might escape it. The story was so dramatic, so inspiring, that\nSzeth wondered why it wasn’t emphasized more in their teachings.\nHe remembered one retelling of it during his days in the monasteries,\nwhen some of the acolytes had acted out the holy text where Talmut had\nstood before the other nine and demanded they let him return to Damnation\nalone, for all of their good. How each of the nine had demanded that he let\nthem be the one to return in his place, only to be refuted by his impeccable\nlogic.\nHe kissed the stone again, glad to have this delay before meeting the\nVoice. Because a part of him that he’d never acknowledged was afraid.\n“What now?” he asked.\nNow, Truth, the Voice said.\n“I do not want a sterilized version,” he said. “Tell me everything.”\nI will.\nThe longer Szeth spent thinking about what had happened to him these\nlast months, the worse he felt. The other Honorbearers had used him to\nremove an inconvenient member of their order.\n“I’m here,” Szeth said, turning around. “Show yourself to me.”\nYou should not make demands of your betters, Szeth, the Voice said. I am\ntempted to make you wait. Would you perhaps like the others to prepare you\nfor what you are about to see?\n“No,” he said. “I don’t want to hear their version of whatever this is.”\nWhy not?\n“I don’t trust them,” he admitted.\nAnd you trust me?\n“I have to,” Szeth said. “If I don’t, what is left?”\nAh … that is an excellent reply, the Voice said. Well, I am not always\nhere, but I have returned in person this time to meet you. Follow the path to\nyour left.\nSzeth turned that way, leaving the Sheathing of Swords, and started\nalong a small pathway between the rock formations, washed smooth by\ncenturies of rainfall drainage.\nThere. Turn here.\nSzeth glanced over and found that—though the wash continued\ndownward—a trail broke off along a shallow ridge some ten feet off the\nground.

He followed this, one hand on the stone cliff face, his steps\ngrinding on a narrow stone ledge. He deliberately chose not to fly.\nThe cavern was barely a few dozen feet along the trail. He stopped\nmaybe ten feet from it.\n“Here?” he asked.\nYes. Upon ascension, each Honorbearer must stand before me. To ask my\napproval.\n“And if one doesn’t get it?”\nThey would have been culled long before being allowed this far.\n“Then what happened with Tuko?” Szeth said.\nHe was promising, but ultimately proved too weak to do what was\nneeded.\n“Which was?”\nCome forward, Szeth. Let us speak in person.\nSzeth frowned, continuing on the path, which seemed … darker than it\nhad moments ago. His mind could not reconcile the discontinuity. Shade on\na cloudless day. A smothering of his soul. A blackness only visible when he\nwasn’t looking directly at it.\nSomething here was very, very wrong.\n“What is that?” Szeth asked.\nWhat?\n“I sense … something dark.”\nSenses are not to be trusted, Szeth. Come to me.\nSzeth walked to the mouth of the cavern. He found Shardblade cuts\nalong the tunnel beyond, and fingerprints? The work of a Stoneward, or a\nWillshaper.\nAre you ready, the Voice said, to meet your God, Szeth?\n“God left us,” he whispered. “God created the world, saw that it pleased\nhim, then moved on. He is the sun high above, and beyond. The spren\nnurture us.”\nYou speak of a god. Not your God, Szeth.\nSzeth swallowed, then stepped into the tunnel. With a single ruby for\nlight, he traveled deeper, his footsteps echoing far into the darkness. Until\nhe reached a room with the tunnel continuing on the other end. The room …\nwas filled with spren.\nNailed to the walls.\nSzeth gasped and gripped the stone on either side of the opening. The\nroom was barely ten feet wide, and had straight flat walls. Here, tens of\nholy spren, each of a different variety, had been affixed in place by crystal\nspikes. As if for ornamentation.\nStones Unhallowed … he could hear them screaming. See them\nwrithing. A windspren, in the shape of a small woman, shrieking in a\nconstant panic, trying to push the spike out of her chest—where it had been\ndriven through her into the stone. A flamespren, quiet but whimpering,\nflickering like a lit candle. A gloryspren, bulbous and round, motionless.\nSome he didn’t understand. That was an angerspren—he’d read of those\n—there, in the puddle of blood. But there was no nail in it—instead the nail\nwas driven though something above it, a vague shape like a plate of\ncarapace from some insect. Another was a translucent arrowhead shape that\nhe didn’t recognize, thrashing like a captured snake.\nSzeth stumbled back, rapidly gasping for breath. Trying to banish their\nterrible screams, so frail, so agonized."

Trying to banish their\nterrible screams, so frail, so agonized.\nI leave them up on purpose, the Voice said, softer. He’d never been able\nto tell if it was a male or female voice. They have to learn their true master.\nSpren need to change, Szeth. I can transform them.\n“Into what?” Szeth hissed.\nInto better versions of themselves. That match me, and what I need them\nto do. Do not fret, Szeth. Things like this have always been done.\nSomething shifted in the tunnel beyond the room. Darkness growing,\nmade manifest into a shadow with human proportions. It was coming. For\nhim.\nSzeth. I have prepared and chosen you for this. Each of the others have\nagreed to do what needs to be done. To prepare.\n“I … I know what you are,” Szeth whispered, trembling.\nGood. You are not the first to guess.\nHe’d read of this. One of the most powerful enemies of humankind. A\ncreature who lived in shadows, made of shadows, who could take spren and\ntwist them to her own ends. He hadn’t realized she could do it to people as\nwell.\nAll his life … from childhood and that first awful day when he’d killed\n… he’d been listening not to a god or a spren.\nBut to one of the Unmade.\nSzeth? the Voice said. I realize it is much to accept and much to bear. I\nknow you can handle it; this is why you were chosen.\nSo it came to this. He had never thought … never believed …\nSzeth, the Voice said, growing more forceful, the shadow approaching.\nCome and worship.\n“I …” Szeth said. “I have to make a decision, don’t I?”\nThe decision is made. You are here.\nIt would be easy to stay. To accept. Yet even now—after all these years\n—he remembered his father’s words. Son. I trust you to decide.\nSzeth had been too afraid to make the right decision as a child. He’d\nalways worried that if he faced such a choice again, again he’d prove too\nweak.\nBut that day, Szeth was stronger than he’d ever been. For as the shadow\ncalled to him, Szeth turned and fled.\nThe destructive version of a melody is not its opposite, then, but\ninstead the exact same song played back at precisely the right\ntime to negate the melody. If you were to hear the two in isolation,\nyou would not be able to tell the difference.\n—From Rhythm of War, first coda, Navani Kholin\nAdolin could still feel his foot.\nIt was the most unreal sensation. His foot was gone; he could see that\nclearly. So far as he knew, what was left of it was pinned underneath the\nthunderclast. The corpse was barely visible as a mound of darkness in the\ndistance.\nBy evening spherelight, Adolin stared at his leg while the surgeon\nworked, affixing the peg.

They sat outside the tents, in the cool night air,\nnear the dome.\n“It’s very important that we get a clean fit, Brightlord,” the surgeon was\nsaying. “We want it so secure and tight that your stump doesn’t move in the\nhogshide cup. The more it slides about, the more the stump will chafe.”\nAdolin just kept staring at the missing limb. It had taken an entire day\nand then some for a surgeon to be spared for the fitting. Adolin hadn’t\npushed for it earlier. He had plenty of work to do, going over shift reports,\ntrying to make new battle plans following yesterday’s disaster.\nThe battle reports weren’t encouraging. He could hear fighting at the\ndome. It was constant now.\n“There will almost certainly be pain anyway,” the surgeon said, pulling\nsome straps tight around Adolin’s thigh. “You have one of Brightness\nNavani’s pain-reduction fabrials?”\n“Somewhere,” Adolin said. “I … don’t often wear it.”\n“You’ll want to start,” the man said, doing another strap. “You’re lucky\nthat we have Regrowth to form you good scars so quickly. Usually we wait\nmonths before fitting a peg.”\n“Lucky,” Adolin said. “Yeah.”\nThe surgeon paused, then continued working, falling silent. Storms,\nAdolin shouldn’t have said that. He was lucky. That thunderclast should\nhave crushed him completely. Plus, he could get that leg back as soon as he\nhad access to a more skilled Radiant healer. Maybe his brother. It would be\ngood to see Renarin again. They’d spent so little time together these last\nmonths.\nHe tried not to consider—instead—the soldiers he knew who couldn’t be\nhealed. The ones Regrowth didn’t work for. Lopen had regrown his arm\nimmediately, after years going without. But some people received full\nRegrowth within a month, but had internalized the wound enough that the\nbody wouldn’t comply. He didn’t know how to combat that. He needed to\nnot accept the wound? Storms, he hated the idea that if he couldn’t get\nhealed properly, it was his fault somehow. Wasn’t the loss of a limb bad\nenough?\nThe surgeon straightened, then nodded to him.\nAdolin tentatively stood up on his left leg, then let the pegged right leg\nstart bearing his weight again. He slipped immediately and the surgeon\ncaught him, holding him steady.\n“It will take time to relearn how to balance,” the surgeon said. “I won’t\nspice up my words, Adolin. A lot of people with a peg need crutches their\nwhole lives.”\nAdolin forced himself to stand again, wobbling.\n“Some do learn to use it by itself as a mobility device,” the surgeon said.\n“It goes faster for duelists, I’ve found. People who have already spent a lot\nof time working on their balance, and who have strength in both legs. But\nBrightlord, I don’t want you in combat.”\n“For how long?”\n“Ever, Adolin,” the man said softly. “We permanently relieve men with\nthese kinds of injuries, and you pay them a pension for their service, if you\nrecall. Many on pegs are unsteady, and we can’t have a man in a shield wall"

        "text": "these kinds of injuries, and you pay them a pension for their service, if you\nrecall. Many on pegs are unsteady, and we can’t have a man in a shield wall\nwho can be shoved out of place with ease.”\nAdolin closed his eyes. Storms. He’d said almost exactly the same words\nto Zabra, hadn’t he?\nA sudden spike of anger rose inside him. Anger at what had happened to\nhim. Anger that he couldn’t help while others were dying. Across the\ncobbled field, an exhausted shield wall held the breach in the dome. Other\nforces held the doorways out.\nAs he’d predicted, after the firestorm of dropped oil, the defending\nforces had lost the entire interior. Reports from scribes who could speak the\nDawnchant said that Abidi the Monarch was inside, proclaiming that the\nHeralds were dead. That the city was nearly theirs. All it would take was a\nfew final pushes.\nAbidi was right. Though the human forces had resisted all day, their\ndefensive lines were barely holding, and were a terrifyingly thin three ranks\ndeep. You needed one line on the front with shields, actively fighting. You\nplaced a second line with pikes, supporting that front line, but also doing\nhard work—exhausting work. Three ranks meant only one line was resting.\nIt would be so much better to have five ranks, and he preferred ten.\nThree meant long shifts with soldiers on their feet. Exhausted, subject to\nconstant assault from a larger force that could rotate in fresh troops far\nfaster. It was a nightmare. And they had to do this for two more days, while\nbeing down to one Shardbearer. A man with Adolin’s Plate—the boot\nreplaced, and cracks sealed by modern fast-grow methods depleting the\nremaining bits of Neziham’s Plate—and Neziham’s Blade. They wouldn’t\nhave access to Neziham’s Plate for the rest of the battle. It would take too\nlong to regrow.\nThe surgeon rose, looking toward the fighting. “I’d best get back to help\nthe wounded on the lines.”\nAdolin nodded, and the surgeon grabbed his bag and jogged away.\nAdolin took his crutches, but tried not to use them as he limped—and slid—\nback into the imperial tent. Yanagawn had made a spot for Adolin in here\nwhere he could take reports in cushioned luxury. He’d assumed that Adolin\nwould want the plushness in which to recuperate. Silently, Adolin hated it,\nbut he also hadn’t wanted to be alone in his own tent.\nTo take a break from it, they’d set out the towers board for their\ncustomary evening game. Adolin gave his crutches to an aide, then forced\nhimself to carefully balance and limp over. It was surprisingly difficult, and\nit felt like his muscles didn’t work like they should. Why should it be so\nhard to keep a rubber-tipped peg from sliding out from underneath him?\nStill, he made it and settled down.\nYanagawn said nothing. He was studying the game board from within\nhis mountainous robes. Adolin had needed to leave when the surgeon was\nfree, which had interrupted their game. Neither had suggested skipping the\nevening play, despite the army’s dire circumstances. Both knew there was\nlittle more they could do. Both also seemed to need this bit of stability."

Both also seemed to need this bit of stability.\nPieces on a table they could control exactly. Indeed, the emperor had dug\nup one of the fancy sets—not just cards, but little soldiers you could deploy\nin place of cards once revealed. They were, amusingly, aluminum.\nYanagawn made his move, executing a classic envelopment, basically\nruining Adolin’s chances of winning the match. He hadn’t been certain\nYanagawn would see the move, as it required some subtle application of the\nterrain.\n“Excellent,” Adolin said, beginning to clear the pieces. “You’ve proven\nyou can perform an assault from a defensive position and win. That’s a\ndifficult one to learn.”\n“It’s hard to decide,” the emperor said, “whether I should hold firm on\nthe defense, or press an advantage and risk losing my privileged position.”\nHe stared at the table a little longer. “This is what you did in the dome the\nother day. You left a position of safety and risked yourself to save\nNeziham.”\n“Yes,” Adolin said softly. “I didn’t think about it so much though. I\nsimply acted.”\n“A hundred days of preparation are needed for one day of spontaneity,”\nYanagawn said.\n“Quoting Sadees at me?” Adolin said with a laugh. “He attacked your\nkingdom.”\n“He came the closest any Alethi ever did to conquering us.”\nThat wasn’t the way the Alethi told it. Sunmaker had taken most of Azir,\nbefore dying from disease.\n“Plus,” Yanagawn said, with a smile, “someone who basically defeated\nus sounds like someone whose tactical insights we should listen to, eh?”\n“I suppose that’s true,” Adolin said, setting out the game pieces again.\nHe nodded to the side as Colot—his uniform bloodied and hair disheveled,\nthough he seemed unwounded—stepped in, glanced at him, then stepped\nback out. Ever since Adolin’s fall, the man had checked on him every few\nhours. But it was difficult to complain. Adolin instructed his officers to\ncheck in on the wounded. It was merely humiliating to be on the receiving\nend.\nI guess being a good example, Adolin thought, can go both ways.\nAdolin shifted and felt the peg knock against the table leg. Storms, every\ntime he moved, it was there reminding him. He maybe should have\nunstrapped it when sitting down, but he figured the faster he got used to\nwearing it, the better.\n“Well, I have some good news, Yanagawn,” Adolin said. “You’ve\ndefeated all the classic training scenarios. You’ve memorized and avoided\nthe ways a general can lose from a stronger position. You have practiced not\nmaking key mistakes—and you’ve learned to react to random chance.\nYou’re not a beginner any longer.”\n“You have no idea how glad I am,” he said, drawing a gloryspren, “to be\nable to learn something that doesn’t involve conjugating verbs or listing\ndates.”\nAdolin chuckled, although inwardly he was horrified.

He was all for men\nlearning whatever they wanted, but he hoped Aunt Navani never heard\nabout Yanagawn’s education. Poor little Gavinor would probably end up\nhaving to memorize the names of all the different kinds of forks in the\nworld.\n“So what next?” Yanagawn asked, leaning forward hungrily. “Do we\nmove on to games where we start out on equal footing?”\n“Journeyman training usually involves something like that,” Adolin said.\n“You’ll get smashed the first few times, but it’s good to knock that crutch\nout from under you when you’re new, before you rely on your confidence in\nwinning too much.”\nYanagawn’s eyes flicked toward the crutches, and it took Adolin a\nmoment to realize what he’d said. Then his foot—which wasn’t even\nstorming there—started to ache again.\n“I’m eager to start losing,” Yanagawn said.\n“Good. After that, it might do you good to try a few unwinnable\nscenarios, to teach you more about minimizing losses and calculated\nretreats. What do you think, Gezamal?” Adolin scanned the room’s guards,\nsearching for Kushkam’s son.\nHe wasn’t here. Adolin went chill. Kushkam the elder was back on his\nfeet and in command after being knocked unconscious, then healed. But his\nson … had he …?\n“He had to be reassigned,” Yanagawn said softly. “Gezamal agreed to\nlead the guards into battle yesterday with me. He listened to me, when he\nshould have rejected my order.”\n“They can reject your orders?”\n“I’m not all powerful, Adolin,” Yanagawn said. “We have a bill of legal\ncitizen rights—and the azaderach-tor, the limit on imperial power and\nreach. Civil servants form a representative government for the people. I am\nthe soul of our people, but I’m not some Alethi dictator.” He glanced down,\nseeming embarrassed. “Sorry. I repeated that as it was told to me; I should\nhave shown more tact.”\n“It’s all right,” Adolin said. “But they act like you’re so powerful.”\n“I reign,” he said, “but do not rule. It’s a fine distinction. Regardless, my\nsoldiers … they’re not supposed to let me hurt myself. Gezamal stood with\nme when I tried to go fight, and so … he was removed.”\n“Yanagawn,” Adolin said, irate, “you can’t punish a good officer for\nmaking a good decision—particularly one you wanted him to make. You\ncan’t let your soldiers question the difference between the moral decision\nand the right one. Make them the same thing!”\n“I understand such criticisms,” Yanagawn said, his head down, arranging\nhis pieces, not meeting Adolin’s eyes. “But there are things we must do to\nbe a civilized society. One of those is to accept that actions have\nconsequences. Embracing those consequences is sometimes both moral and\nright.”\nAdolin shook his head, finding that attitude utterly contemptible.

That made small talk awkward.\nThey dug into a few more games. After crushing Yanagawn a few times\nas promised, Adolin decided to use the facilities. He refused the crutches as\nhe limped out of the tent, intending to hit the officers’ latrine.\nColot was waiting in the moonlight outside.\n“Checking on me again?” Adolin said. “You might be going a little too\nfar on that, Colot.”\n“I found him, Adolin.”\n“Him?”\n“Kushkam’s son,” he said. “He was reassigned to basic infantry. He’s on\nrotation out to reserves right now, if you want to talk to him.”\nAdolin hesitated, then grinned. “Colot, you gemstone of a human being.\nYou’re wasted as an officer.”\n“I am?” he said, sounding amused.\n“You should have been a sergeant, given how useful you are. Come on,\nlet’s go and talk to Gezamal. I feel we might have an open spot in my guard\nfor someone like him.”\nSzeth wasn’t certain he wanted to keep living. Yet Nin said they wanted to\nmake Szeth immortal?\nSzeth was numb from that revelation. He would have welcomed laughter\nor tears, or really any emotion other than the crushing pressure. That grip on\nhis heart, squeezing. Making of him a ball of stone.\nNin had left them earlier in the night, saying he needed to prepare for\nsomething. Szeth now watched the last flickers of their campfire, embers\nfalling apart, relaxing as life finally left them and their colors faded. How\nstrange to see no flamespren upon the fire; he had spent so many years in\nplaces where spren, like stone, were common. The unusual had become\nusual. A fitting metaphor for his life.\nA Herald. Eternal. The idea made him want to run. To hide himself\nsomeplace where the very movements of the earth could grind him down\ninto the nothing that he deserved to be. He had lived a horrible, murderous\nlife, but always he had believed there would be an out. An end, in death.\nIf he completed this pilgrimage, death would be no end.\nBut is this not the torment you deserve? a part of him questioned. To hear\nthose whispers forever? To spend eternity adding to his body count, for the\nHeralds were—first and foremost—soldiers. Ishu might be a scholar, but he\nwas also one of their finest swordsmen.\nTo live among them … as one of them … would be agony.\nAnd what of my father? My sister? Were they trapped in some kind of\nhalf-death? Would … becoming a Herald mean that at least he’d be with\nthem?\nHe looked up as a figure approached his dozing fire, but it was not\nKaladin, Sylphrena, or even Nin. It was a creature in the shape of a man,\nbut whose figure cut a hole in reality itself—displaying a starfield beyond.\n“Hello, my squire,” the spren said.\nSzeth bowed his head.

The spren had never appeared to him in such a\nhuman shape before. He was honored. It was an emotion he could paste to\nthe ball of stone that was his crushed innards, like a note stuck with gum\npaste to the message post in the center of town.\nThe spren sat down on the other side of the embers. Kaladin and Syl\nwere playing the flute on the next hillside over. Szeth found a certain …\nvibrance to Kaladin’s playing. It wasn’t good. He played haltingly, often\nstarting, stopping, then replaying the same sequence multiple times. And he\nknew only one song.\nIt should have been annoying, but Szeth remembered when his sister had\npracticed this way. She’d needed to feel out songs as she learned them. In\nthis, Kaladin’s music was alive—finding its way, growing. To Szeth that\nwas beautiful, and it was one of the few things on this trip that had offered\nhim comfort.\n“Szeth,” the spren said, “I would speak to you.”\n“Please,” Szeth said softly, gazing down at the embers.\n“Do you have … questions for me?”\n“Is it true?” Szeth said. “That this is my destiny? To join the Heralds?”\n“Yes,” the spren said. “It is why Nale first came to you, why he gave you\nthat black sword. The weapon is supposedly a kind of … test of a person’s\ncharacter. You have passed.”\n“I’ve done little with the sword,” Szeth said, glancing toward where\nNightblood and the Honorblades lay.\n“That is part of passing the test.”\nKaladin’s music cut off as he played a comically bad note. Then laughter\ndrifted over as Syl said something. Szeth’s spren looked that direction, and\nthough his posture was difficult to read, he appeared … envious.\n“Do you wish our bond was more like theirs?” Szeth asked.\n“I shouldn’t,” the spren said. “Our bond is not like theirs. No highspren\nshould want one where the human could kill us. It is unseemly.”\nThat part was true. Szeth didn’t know the mechanics, but it had been\nshared with him as he reached higher levels of training. A highspren could\nend their bond at any point, with no repercussions to either of them. No\ndeadeyed highspren existed, or would exist. If Szeth walked away from his\noaths, his spren would not be hurt.\nThe way they did this involved a distance between them, which\nprotected the highspren from the human. And that distance was part of why\ntheir attitude toward their Radiants was so different as well.\n“It is not appropriate for a piece of deity to laugh as she does, to joke and\nmake light,” his spren added. “It just sounds so … friendly. Regardless, I\nwish I could have explained your true task in this pilgrimage, Szeth. Nale\nsaid I could not until you were fully committed.

The\ncorrelation between Shadesmar and this land wasn’t absolute; reflections\ncould show up here in odd ways. On the other side, those spren likely\nmarched or swam toward their destination. It now made sense to him why\nthey were going. To witness what would happen to Szeth. Should he\nsucceed.\n“I do not wish for this burden,” he whispered.\n“I know,” the spren said. “Nale and my superiors tell me that only one\nwho does not want the burden should be offered it. They’ve been waiting\nfor you for many years. A man with no attachments, trained in the best arts\nof war—a man who will fight on command, and who knows how to follow\nthe dictates of such an important bond. You’re perfect for the role, Szeth.\nNot only an expert with the Surges. You are completely in control and\ncompletely obedient.”\n“That is required, then, of a Herald?”\n“How else do you think they survived thousands of years?”\nIt seemed to him that the Heralds had been getting worse over the years.\nSo were they actually surviving? But of course such thoughts were foolish.\nThe Heralds were imbued with the power of Honor himself—and it was\nHonor’s very nature to be obedient and to demand obedience. Honor was\nthe force by which up became up and down became down. Gravityspren did\nnot question. Szeth should not either. It was what he’d been taught in the\nmonasteries.\nNow those teachings were crushing him to the point that he could barely\nbreathe. He felt it coming on again, a tightening that was somehow worse\nthan the numbness. A paralyzing tension, as if he were steam needing to\nescape, but there was no release. Just more. And more. Pressure. Pushing\nhim to—\nKaladin’s music began once more. A flute, reminding Szeth of the days\nwhen his dances had not left corpses. He found himself able to breathe.\n“I know that song from somewhere …” Szeth’s spren said.\n“It’s … possible, then?” Szeth forced out. “To make a new Herald?”\n“So far as I understand,” the spren said, turning back to the fire. Did he\nwatch the embers die? What did an immortal being think about such\nendings? “The Oathpact unravels because of Jezrien’s death, but it is a slow\nunraveling. The enemy has been unable to find and destroy any other\nHeralds, and so the hole can be patched. It would require taking a piece of\nHonor, forging from it a new sword. Saying the most important Words a\nperson can say, and joining the Heralds.”\n“The Words,” Szeth said. “I cannot be told them.”\n“Yes!” the spren said, animatedly gesturing with both hands. “You see.\nYou understand.”\n“I do,” Szeth said. And knew he had the right Words inside him. “It is …\nnecessary?”\n“Ishar has foreseen that unless the Oathpact is reforged,” the spren said,\n“millions will suffer. Millions upon millions.”\nThe ball tightened."

Millions upon millions.”\nThe ball tightened.\n“Then I will do it,” Szeth whispered, closing his eyes. “There was never\nany question that I would, was there?”\n“Well, not until Kaladin started … you know. Helping.”\n“I would be dead now if he hadn’t,” Szeth said. “Nin is broken, spren.\nThis test is irrational. Any soldier can lose a fight, no matter how good that\nsoldier is. He could have accidently seen me dead at any point on this\nquest.”\n“He … says that vigilant adherence to the law will protect you.”\n“He does not know what is right any longer,” Szeth said, staring out into\nthe darkness. Nin’s departure left Szeth concerned, because the next\nmonastery was the Skybreaker one. “Nin was angry that I refused to fight\nmy sister. But not fighting her is how I won the battle!”\n“I …” The spren looked away, toward the music. “I want to help. Really\nhelp. Be your partner, Szeth. I … wanted you to know that.”\nHow strange, that this uncertain, amiable being was the same one who\nhad spoken to him so imperiously before. Spren, it seemed, were as capable\nas humans of wearing different faces and putting on airs.\n“I joined the Skybreakers,” the spren said, “and became a knight within\ntheir ranks so that I might help protect the world. We’re not like other\norders—we never abandoned our duties. So … I’m trying, Szeth. Once\nyou’re a Herald, I’m … ready.”\n“What is the cost to you?”\n“What you do, I have to do with you,” the spren explained. “Nale’s spren\nwas always trapped with him on Braize, and subject to the pains that the\nenemy can inflict.”\n“Storms,” Szeth whispered.\n“Ishar searches for a way to make us truly physical,” the spren said. “I\ndo not know the details—he will not share them with the Skybreakers—but\nhe says it will make us untorturable.”\n“How would you having physical bodies,” Szeth said, “make you less\neasy to torture?”\n“I don’t know,” the spren admitted. “Ishar has been erratic these last few\nmillennia. I’m sure he has a good plan in there somewhere. He always\ndoes.”\n“And the Unmade plaguing Shinovar?” Szeth said. “I assume that\ncleansing the land is how I prove I am worthy of being a Herald?” Again,\nthe tightening inside. “But how does it relate? Why am I fighting\nHonorbearers, and why haven’t the Heralds cleansed them already?”\nThe spren squirmed on the ground by the fire.\n“I can’t know this yet?” Szeth asked.\nThe spren shook his head.\n“I know an Unmade is here,” Szeth said. “I heard its Voice in my head,\nstarting on the day I killed the soldier. I discovered its place of darkness,\nand realized—even back then—that my people were corrupted. At the time,\nI believed the Unmade in Shinovar meant the Return had begun—I didn’t\nrealize that the Unmade had been left behind."

At the time,\nI believed the Unmade in Shinovar meant the Return had begun—I didn’t\nrealize that the Unmade had been left behind.\n“So, I was both wrong and right. Wrong, in that the general mass of the\nVoidbringers had not yet Returned. Right, in that a servant of Odium was\ndoing terrible things to my people.” He thought a moment. “Are the Heralds\nunable to cleanse this land for some reason? Must it be a Shin who\nperforms the act? Perhaps that allows the Shin people to be redeemed, and\njoin the fight?”\nThe spren didn’t reply.\n“But why so late?” Szeth said softly. “The war has been happening for\nwell over a year now. Longer, depending on when the first Voidspren began\nto appear.”\n“Answers will come …” the spren said.\n“… in the next two monasteries,” Szeth said with a sigh.\n“Yes.” The spren paused. “Szeth, can I admit something to you? I …\ndon’t know the answers. I … have some of the very same questions you\ndo.”\nSzeth settled back as the last embers died. He had thought the matter of\nhis future settled. He had chosen Kaladin’s path, that of peace, but now the\nworld itself had been settled upon his shoulders.\nPeace was something for other people. For Szeth, there had always been\n—and would always be—voices in the darkness. And his insides were\ncrushed between the force of landscapes: one made of stone, and the other\nsoil.\nWhile hunting down Gezamal, Adolin walked the entire way across the\ncobbled courtyard on his own, without needing crutches—though he did\nhave to lean on Colot now and then. Notum arrived, full sized, hovering\nnext to them as he gave a quiet report. The lines were holding, but\ncasualties were frighteningly high. In turn, morale was frighteningly low.\nThe defenders had finally, reluctantly, gathered a second—and later\ntoday, even a third—wave of recruits from the city. Untrained men and\nwomen with spears and shields would hold the first line, with more\nexperienced soldiers using pikes from behind. It was a horrible tactic, but\nthe sole one available—plugging holes in the front with people who had\nonly the most basic of training.\nOnce you started building weak points into your lines, the fall was\nimminent.\nTwo days, Adolin thought. Less than that now. Practically a day and a\nhalf. That’s all we have to survive. The contest would happen at midday on\nthe tenth day at Urithiru, meaning late morning here in Azir.\nStill, he could hear people screaming as they fought.\n“At least,” Notum said, “the enemy forces have been vastly depleted.\nThey are tired too, and wounded.”\n“Yeah,” Colot said. “But there’s still more of them, so they can rest their\nlines better.”\nHe was probably right. The enemy had been depleted, then demoralized\nby the Herald attack, the loss of the thunderclast, and the firebombs the day\nbefore. Plus, if he’d been in command of the singers, he’d have picked a\nforce and rested them for a day, keeping the humans busy with other troops."

Blood of his fathers … the worst part\nwas not being able to help. To be hobbling along on one good leg while\nsoldiers died. He was able to send Kushkam some suggestions on where to\nposition the weaker pike blocks, but that didn’t feel like much. Maybe\nAdolin could put on the Plate himself, leave one leg out with the peg, and—\nNo. He wouldn’t let his pride endanger the city—he was good with\nPlate, but one of his armor standbys would be better. He hated it, but the\nmature thing was to let someone else fight in his place.\nThey passed the shadow of the fallen thunderclast. At least his leg had a\nstorming fine tombstone. Past that were the latrines, a row of wooden\nouthouses with steps up onto them, and bottom sections that could be\nremoved and periodically Soulcast—waste and all. Adolin found it amusing\nto think that some of the city’s bronze came, literally, from dung.\nThe younger Kushkam was here, wearing gloves and an apron over his\nuniform, cleaning latrines. His weapons were near, and he—as a fit soldier\n—would be doing a full rotation on the front lines like everyone else.\nDuring his time off however, instead of resting, he got this duty.\nAdolin barely contained his anger; demoting a man like Gezamal was an\ninsult. Specifically, an insult to every soldier who had made a snap—and\ncorrect—decision to disobey orders when the circumstances changed.\n“Gezamal,” he said, catching the man’s attention. “Missed you at our\nnightly game.”\nGezamal seemed glad to see Adolin, judging by his posture in the night\nas he stood taller and hopped down the steps. “Adolin? Walking already?\nYou’ll be fit for service again in no time.”\nA small lie, of the type soldiers told one another. Adolin clasped hands\nwith the man—though only after Gezamal had removed his gloves and\npositioned himself downwind.\n“You like my new offices?” Gezamal said, gesturing.\n“Gezamal,” Adolin said softly, “this is an affront. I can’t believe—”\n“Stop,” Gezamal said, his entire posture changing. He stood more alert,\nand shied back. “Do not speak ill of the emperor.”\n“I won’t. But this business of demoting you? It’s insanity! After what\nyou did?”\n“What I did,” Gezamal said, his voice grown cold, “was what needed to\nbe done. As is this.”\n“What?” Adolin said. “Gezamal—”\n“Adolin,” he said, lowering his voice, “when I ordered my men to march\ninto battle with the emperor, I knew what it would cost. If he’d been\ninjured, I’d have been executed. He wasn’t, blessedly, so I’ll accept this.”\n“What you did was right.”\n“Which is why I’m fine taking my duties now.”\n“It’s bad military discipline, Gezamal,” Adolin said. “You can’t punish"

You need officers to feel comfortable making decisions. If\nyou muddle that with a fear of repercussions, the result is indecisive\nleadership. And the result of that is disaster.”\nGezamal sighed and settled down on the outhouse steps, nodding as a\nsoldier arrived to use the facilities. Gezamal slumped forward a little,\ncrossing his arms. “I suppose we shouldn’t fault you for offering advice\nwhen that’s what we invited you here to do. It’s probably good advice, too.\nIf there’s one thing the Alethi know, it’s how to maintain a disciplined\nfighting force.”\n“Not all of us,” Adolin said, thinking of Sadeas’s armies. “But I’ve\nlearned a few things. Either we need to get your demotion reversed, or at\nthe very least I want you on my staff. I value a soldier who has the courage\nto do what you did.”\n“I appreciate the offer. But I won’t leave.”\n“Why?”\nGezamal looked up as the first moon started to set behind him, the violet\nlight dwindling. “You ever love something flawed, Adolin?”\n“Isn’t everything flawed?” he said, glancing at Colot, who had so far\nremained silent in this conversation.\n“I suppose it is,” Gezamal said. “Well, I love the empire. I love that our\npeople have stood for thousands of years, against invaders with more\nShards. I love that we have produced writing and art, standing as a light\nagainst the twin tides of ignorance and lies.\n“I love that in Azir, a thief can become emperor. That any person who\ndedicates themselves can take the tests and rise high. I love the way we\nhave reasons for what we do. Yes, the weight of those reasons might create\nbooks full of bureaucracy. Yes, it might get unwieldy. Yes, it might hurt you\nnow and then. But everything you love is going to hurt you now and then,\nbecause it is flawed.”\nHe rose from the steps. “There should obviously be a threshold for being\nhurt. We haven’t reached mine. The laws say that a man who did what I did\nneeds to be punished. Maybe the law should change, but I accept what has\nhappened. Because Adolin, I guarantee that every other soldier in our\nmilitary—even those who think I was a monster for putting the emperor in\ndanger—understands. Accepting your punishment with decorum is a mark\nof respect for the thing we all love.”\nAnother soldier passed in the night and nodded to Gezamal. Neither gave\nsalutes, but the impression Adolin had was similar. Thoughtful, Adolin\nnodded to Gezamal himself, then let him return to what he’d been doing.\nAdolin started back across the courtyard. Pondering. Did he love things\nthat hurt him?\nMaybe not something. But certainly someone. A father.\n“I think …” Colot said, walking with him, “I get it, Adolin. Maybe that’s"

Maybe that’s\nwhy I’m still a soldier.” The red-haired man paused, then turned and gazed\nback at the setting moon. “It hurt, being rejected by the Windrunners. All\ntheir ideals—about protecting, about helping—meant so much to me. It\nreally seemed to be working. I learned to draw in the Light, and I even took\nto the sky a few times. And then …”\n“You told me the spren didn’t want you,” Adolin said. “Because you\nwere lighteyed.”\n“It feels so strange,” Colot said, “to have something that had always\nbeen an advantage turn against me. Should I be embarrassed? Angry? Is it\nfair that I should get rejected when I personally didn’t do anything other\nthan be born lighteyed?” He sighed. “I wish I knew, Adolin. I start to feel\nbetter, then I see them flying, and it all floods back …” He looked to\nAdolin, then appeared embarrassed. “Sorry. Just … I get what Gezamal\nsaid. I’m still here. Despite when it hurts.”\nNotum soon came zipping back, and fetched Colot, as Kushkam needed\nhim to take command while he saw to other duties. Despite his obvious\nfatigue, Colot jogged away, leaving Adolin alone as the moonlight\nvanished. He balanced precariously on the peg and the stump that was\nalready starting to ache. Listening to other people fight, and feeling a\nmounting dread.\nThey weren’t going to last another day and a half.\nNINE AND A HALF YEARS AGO\nSzeth landed in a crash of Stormlight, expanding from him in a puff, frost\ncrystallizing on his clothes. Sloppy. He was using too much. He’d … he’d\nbeen warned about that …\nHe scrambled up to his father’s cookfire. How long had it been? Hours?\nHours since he’d entered that tunnel …\nHe barely remembered running. Fleeing. Not only from the Unmade, but\nfrom the past. He rushed up to his father—firelight throwing violent\nshadows—and grabbed him by the shoulders. This little waystop was off\nthe roadway. It was where Neturo said he’d wait until …\n“Son?” Neturo said, cowering before Szeth.\n“It’s all a lie,” Szeth said, Stormlight streaming from his arms. Too\nmuch. He’d taken in too much. It burned through him, demanding he move,\nfight, take action, or run …\n“What?” Neturo asked. “Son? What’s wrong?”\nI can’t bring him into this, Szeth thought. Not until I know what I’m\ndoing.\n“Stay here,” Szeth insisted, leaning in, making Neturo cringe. “Hide.\nHide, Father.”\n“Szeth,” Neturo said, reaching out and placing his right hand on Szeth’s\ncheek. “Son. Deep breaths, like when you were a child. Remember?”\nRemember?\nDeep breaths.\nSzeth drew them in, remembering those peaceful, perfect days. Free\nfrom problems.\nNo, Szeth thought. Sivi was right.

I … Father, what if I’m wrong?”\n“I can’t help you if you don’t tell me. But Szeth … I trust you.”\n“How?” Szeth said, collapsing to his knees. “I’m so wrong so very often,\nFather. Then when I choose, I hate my choices. How can you trust me?”\n“I’ve never met anyone who wants to do the right thing more than you,\nSzeth.”\n“Wanting has never been enough, Father.”\nNeturo merely embraced him, pulling Szeth—still kneeling—to his\nchest. “I know. But sometimes it’s all we have, Szeth. I’m sorry I don’t have\nbetter answers. I guess … I stayed with you, hoping I’d be able to find them\nfor you.

It was the week before he passed—after we got news that the\nHonorbearers couldn’t come.”\n“There are … too many who need Regrowth,” Szeth said. “They can’t\ntravel for most cases. They can only heal those who come to them …” That\nhad been a difficult few months. Learning to heal each day, trying to treat as\nmany of the petitioners as possible, discovering that he couldn’t help a\nshocking number of them—as the wounds were too old.\n“My father, Vallano,” Neturo said, “broke down crying when he realized\nhe was going to die.

We have to figure out the rest.”\n“There should be more than that. More than me.”\nNeturo didn’t say anything as they sat in that firelight, windblown smoke\ncurling around them, mixing with Szeth’s Stormlight.\nHe was all they had. Him. Szeth. He had to do something.\n“Stay here,” Szeth said. “Stay hidden. Please.”\nWith that, Szeth launched into the air again.\nAnti-Light is not inherently the opposite of standard Light, nor is\nit negative, or imaginary, or a philosophical opposite.

She needed the vision to start a bit earlier than that so\nshe could have more space to remember lighter times, before she\nconfronted more darkness. She could and would do this; she just needed\nsome trackway first to begin running. She felt a hint of surprise in the\nshifting motions of the chaos as she asserted her will over the vision, but it\npassed in a blink, and she appeared in her own body once again.\nShe was seated, being fussed over by the royal Alethi makeup artists.\nShe remembered being amused that such a thing as official royal makeup\nartists existed.\nIt was her wedding day. She’d been betrothed to Adolin for months, but\nthe marriage had not yet proceeded. In part because she hadn’t committed\nuntil after the battle of Thaylen Field—where Dalinar had united the realms\nfor the first time. That day, a glorious event had occurred: Adolin Kholin\nhad pierced through illusion and facade and seen the real Shallan.\nShe had seen him too. Experienced the deep, true him, and the wonderful\nfuture they could have. Now she sat—stressed and overwhelmed—as they\nprepared her for the actual ceremony.\nUntil the boots arrived.\nKaladin’s gift—ones that would fit her, but of a military cut and design.\nShallan laughed, holding them up. The stress melted away. She was both\nwomen. The Shallan getting married, and the Shallan living through these\nvisions again. To anyone else, being two women at once might have been\ndemanding and confusing. For Shallan it was just everyday life.\nOnly two people at the same time? How easy.\nAfter the gifts, Shallan was led to a small room to pray and meditate.\nToday, she ran her fingers over the brushpen and ink jar, thinking. At the\ntime, she hadn’t enjoyed her wedding as much as she should have. The day\nhad been chaos and anxiety, like so much of her life, really. She had been\nJasnah’s ward. Shouldn’t she have learned to instill a little order in her life?\nHumming sounded from behind.\nShe turned to find Pattern there, full sized, holding hands with Testament\n—who was the one humming.\n“She wanted to be here, with you,” Pattern said. “On this day, a year ago.\nUnfortunately, she had to remain hidden. To protect you.”\n“From myself.”\n“From the pains of life,” Pattern replied. “And from truth, for a time. In\nyou, the lie was life, Shallan. We need them sometimes. Even spren. You\ntaught me that.”\nShallan took Testament’s hands in her own. “Thank you.”\nTestament, in return, mumbled something Shallan couldn’t make out.\nShallan leaned in, straining to hear as Testament repeated the words.\n“Enjoy.

Enjoy it.\n“I deserve this,” Shallan said, leaning back, remembering what she’d\nrealized on this day. It was all right to be happy. “Why do I need to keep\nlearning the same lessons? Can’t I make progress for once?”\n“You aren’t relearning the same lessons,” Pattern said. “You’re\nreinforcing them. In math, you can know a thing, yes, but it is the proof that\nteaches the deeper truth. Life is your proof, Shallan.”\n“I suppose,” Shallan said, “it is good to revisit what you’ve learned, now\nand then. For added context.”\nThese visions … Had she appreciated them? The ability to go back and\nwitness life as it had been? Laughter with her brothers. Seeing her father\nagain. Hurtful though he had often been, she didn’t hate him.\nThen there was her mother.\nShe had been here, at the wedding. Shallan had refused to see, or at least\nremember, the first time. Now her eyes were open, and her veil removed.\n“I want to live it again,” she whispered. “Let’s do it.”\nHer brothers soon invaded her small chamber, as they had on that day.\nShe embraced them as if seeing them for the first time in ages, which—in a\nway—was true of her current self too. She let them love her, and she loved\nthem.\nShe accepted the letter they had brought from Mraize, explaining that he\nhad kept his promise and protected them. As always, there was an implicit\nthreat in his words. Today she ignored that. Today, she was going to enjoy\nher wedding. How many people actually got to relive such a marvelous\nevent? She took a deep breath, stepped out, and joined the celebration.\nIt was beautiful.\nThey’d chosen one of the top rooms of Urithiru, with an enormous\nwindow looking out at frosted peaks. Everyone was there, swirling with\njoyspren like blue leaves. Her brothers, who’d only just discovered their\nsister was marrying one of the most powerful men in the world. Her squires,\nwho were becoming Radiants in their own right. Vathah, Ishnah, Red, Gaz,\neven Shob. Stargyle and Beryl hadn’t joined yet at the time.\nKaladin stood in a back corner, his face an emotionless mask. She tried\nnot to think of choosing Adolin as a rejection of Kaladin—more an\nacknowledgment that for all the powerful moments they’d experienced\ntogether, their relationship was not one of romance but shared pain.\nSebarial and Palona, looking like proud parents. Women she’d come to\nknow, like Ka and Rushu. Everyone in their finest, men in formal white\nsuits with colors—in sashes or capes—declaring house allegiances.

He’d later tell\nher it was a gift from Kaladin. He’d been given forty-seven different swords\nthat day, including one from her, and had chosen to wear Kaladin’s.\nAnother man might have done that to prove victory over a rival. For\nAdolin, it was an earnest acknowledgment of a friend. Shallan took a\nMemory of it all, something she’d failed to do last year. She would re-create\nthis day in art—but knew that no mere charcoal pencil would suffice. She’d\nneed to practice with oils; as soon as Dalinar’s contest was finished, that\nwould be her task.\nShe met Adolin in the center of the room. He wore white, again by\ntradition, though she’d never seen an Alethi wedding outfit before, with its\nexaggerated cloth shoulders, its robelike design, its stiff—yet wide—cuffs\nand collar. Trimmed in Kholin blue, with a formal blue hat to represent\nmodesty before the Almighty. Her sapphire dress was equally antiquated,\nwith swooping wide cuffs and so much embroidery it covered most of the\ndress. The sewn-in rubies glowed, reflected in the gold on the bridal crown\nand thick overvest.\nShallan loved it—they looked like characters from a play. And as\ngorgeous as Adolin’s outfit was, nothing could match his smile as he took\nher hands. In Jah Keved, she would have been given away by a senior\nhouse member, but by Alethi tradition, no one led them or gave them away.\nThey were their own free people by the law, and owned by none.\nWitnesses were required, however, and Navani and Palona would offer\nthe notarization for that. They moved up alongside the arch that represented\na portal to a new beginning. On the right side was Wit, dressed in black, the\nonly one in the room wearing that color.\nHand in hand, Shallan and Adolin walked to the arch and stood beneath\nit. Kadash, the ex-warrior ardent, officiated. Adolin’s trusted spiritual\nadvisor. She remembered the ceremony going by in a flash before. Today it\nlingered. As she stared into Adolin’s eyes and felt his hands, she let it be\nwonderful. Let it last as long as possible.\n“Nothing brings the Almighty more joy,” Kadash said, “than an oath\nmade in earnest. So it should be no surprise that two oaths, made in love,\nare an experience sublime.\n“We were formed by the Almighty, and find our deepest joy in building,\ncreating, making oaths—and keeping them. The truly special experience of\nmarriage is the chance to help one another in this journey. None of us is\nperfect, and so none of us can keep oaths perfectly.

Together, your oaths will stand apart from the world.\n“I believe that in nothing are we so blessed,” Kadash continued, “as we\nare in our ability to accept one another as imperfect, yet trying. So look at\none another. Remember this love, but know that this is merely the\nbeginning. Each day, love should grow, until what you come to feel is a\nbonfire to today’s candle, overshadowing lesser flames.\n“To build a bonfire is more difficult than to light a candle. You will find\nthe powerful heat to be a reward all throughout your lives. Here, I witness\n—we all witness—that a bond is formed. What the Almighty forges, let no\nperson seek to undermine.”\nShallan beamed. She felt it. Being here. Being alive. Adolin’s warmth,\nfrom his palms into hers. Heat of life and love.\n“Your oaths have been prepared?” Kadash asked.\n“They have,” Adolin said, squeezing her hands. “Shallan, my life is\nyours, my strength is yours, and our journeys are now one. My oath to you\nis love. Forever.”\n“Adolin,” she whispered, remembering the words she’d spoken as if they\nwere new, “my life is yours. My strength, always, is yours. When you are\nweak, let me be strong. When I am weak, please lend me your strength. And\nwhen we are both weak, at least we will not be alone. Never again alone,\nfor our journeys have together become one. My love, forever. This is my\noath.”\nHe grinned. “A little improvisation from what you wrote before,\ngemheart?”\nShe leaned in. “Get used to it, gemheart. It will only get wilder from\nhere.”\nHe kissed her, causing some whispers in the room, as it was not yet time\nfor kissing. He could improvise as well.\n“Then,” Kadash said, “it is witnessed and sealed by my authority from\nthe Almighty. Two oaths have become one. Two hearts become one. Two\njourneys become one. You, Adolin Kholin, and you, Shallan Davar, are\none.” He paused. “This is when you’re supposed to kiss …”\nShe grabbed Adolin, went up on her toes, and kissed him with as much\nforce and life and heat as she could manage, in an explosion of\npassionspren like crystalline snow. She held it, until she heard people\ncoughing and shuffling, but she didn’t care about their discomfort. She\nbreathed his breath and pressed herself to him and became his as he became\nhers.\nBecause she.\nDeserved.\nThis.\nSo much might be wrong and stressful, but she did not walk alone any\nlonger.

Shallan was sure she saw\nsomething right itself in Testament’s pattern just then. Tines unbending\nslightly; her pattern restoring in some small way. Testament had been\nunable to attend the wedding the first time, but now … now it could be\nright. Indeed, Shallan hadn’t been able to experience this fully the first time\neither. She’d still had things to learn.\nToday, she looked away from the spren. Toward Kaladin brooding in one\ncorner. After checking on him, she’d looked to Sebarial and Palona, given\nthem a grin, then had seen a flash of red hair behind them. Followed by a\nface.\nThat haunting, distressing face.\nShallan had given that moment to Veil. Now, she could finally see,\naccept, and acknowledge it. Her mother stood at the back of the room,\namong the servants.\nThe Herald had died, and returned.\nShallan had killed her and sent her to Braize, where she had broken and\ncome back to Roshar. Initiating the Return, unleashing the Voidbringers,\nand starting all of this.\nNINE AND A HALF YEARS AGO\nThe next morning, Szeth landed back at the Windrunner monastery and\nstrode through the open front gates.\nConfident. He was the only hope his people had.\nHe was it.\nAcolytes scattered, running for their shamans. By the time Szeth had\nreached the Honorbearer’s quarters—Szeth’s quarters—the ten shamans of\nthe monastery had gathered. In defiance of their station, each was wearing a\nfaded red armband, left out in the sun. For mourning.\nAppropriate.\n“Walk with me,” Szeth commanded them.\n“Honor-nimi,” the lead shaman said. Faraz-daughter-Daraz, he thought\nher name was. A short woman with brown skin and jet-black hair, cut close\nand curly. “We ten have conferred, and we ask to be sent as traveling\nshamans to visit villages in the region, rather than maintaining the\nmonastery.”\nA profound demotion. And a profound statement.\n“I barely spoke with you while I trained here,” Szeth said. A deliberate\nmisphrasing. They’d barely spoken to him. He’d been treated with strict\ncoolness during that year. “Tell me. Where did Tuko find you?”\nFaraz didn’t reply, but one of the others piped up. “We’re rejects,” he\nsaid. “Turned down by the other monasteries.”\n“Turned down,” Szeth guessed, “but not because of lack of skill with the\nsword?”\n“I was one of the best,” Faraz said, her chin up. Hardly appropriate\nhumility for a servant of the Heralds. “I defeated Pozen’s swordmaster in\none out of five bouts.”\n“To win even a single point on Gonda-son-Darias is indeed an\naccomplishment,” Szeth said.\n“You took him down five for five, I heard,” Faraz said, reluctantly.\n“Yes,” Szeth said, surveying the group of them. “But I have an\nuncommon skill, even among those uncommonly skilled. Five of you are of\nthe sword, and five of the book?”"

Five of you are of\nthe sword, and five of the book?”\n“Technically,” one of the others said.\n“In reality, all ten are of the sword,” Szeth guessed, nodding. “Originally\nrejected because of your rebellious attitudes, then gathered here. So, Tuko\nwas actually planning a rebellion.” Szeth started down the hallway. “Walk\nwith me.”\nThey did not.\nSzeth turned back to them. “I have not released you. Until I do, I am\nHonorbearer. Be glad you have me.”\n“You killed Tuko!” shouted one of the others.\n“As I said, be glad,” Szeth said. “I am more skilled than he was. You will\nneed the very best to resist the others. If Tuko truly believed in Truth, then\nhe would have wished for me to take his place.”\nThe others considered that as Szeth walked through the quiet hallway.\nFinally, the gaggle of shamans joined him. “What are you saying?” Faraz\ndemanded.\nSzeth turned a corner and threw open the armory doors. As he’d\nremembered, Tuko kept the room well-stocked. It was a centerpiece of each\nMonastery of Truth, but many were maintained more out of ritual than\nactive need. Not so here. Swords in stacks, gemstones, armor and shields in\nabundance. The larder would be well maintained to resist a siege, and the\nmonastery—like each of them—had its own wells.\nIf he could recruit Moss, they’d have Soulcasting, which would mean\ninfinite food so long as they took care of their gemstones. Unfortunately, he\nwasn’t certain he would be able to persuade him. Maybe Sivi …\n“Szeth?” Faraz demanded. “Um, honor-nimi?”\n“Did Tuko tell you why he planned to rebel?” Szeth said.\n“No,” she admitted. “It didn’t get that far. He said that the others might\nattack us, and we should prepare. When the time came, and we were ready\n… except he backed down. He waited. Until you arrived.”\n“He assumed that he could defeat me.” Szeth looked to the gathered ten,\nand saw fear in their eyes now. “Tuko discovered, as I recently have, that\nthe other Honorbearers serve one of the Unmade.”\nHis voice didn’t even tremble. Did he sound confident? He felt it, for\nonce.\n“An Unmade?” Faraz asked softly.\n“Yes. I do not yet know if they are deceived or aware, but they are\nactively following the thing’s demands. They call it ‘the Voice.’” He\npaused, then took a deep breath. “I must declare, alone, that the Desolation\nhas arrived. The Voidbringers have returned. At long last, the day of Truth is\nhere—and it is time to fight.”\nOnly one Unmade so far, that he had seen. The records from thousands\nof years ago were fragmentary copies of copies, but the general consensus\namong scholars was that if one Voidbringer was found, the rest would soon\nfollow—or had already come in secret. He turned to the others, who were\nthem universally alarmed, wide-eyed. Yet then they started nodding. Tuko"

Tuko\nhad been working on them, despite not explaining fully.\n“I have hope,” Szeth said, “that I can recruit one or two of the\nHonorbearers. The others will resist us, so we must move quickly. Mobilize\nand recruit any among the people who are willing. It is time for war, and for\nus to pray to the Heralds that we are not too late.”\nIf you played the “destructive” melody and the primary melody at\nthe same time, they would reinforce one another instead of\ndestroying. This is humans and singers. Not opposites.\nThe same song. Played at different times.\n—From Rhythm of War, first coda, Navani Kholin\nShallan left Adolin standing beneath the ceremonial archway of new\nbeginnings.\nIt was the kind of callous thing women did in stories, but that wasn’t the\nreal him—and when she acknowledged that, the rest fell apart for her. It\nwasn’t the real Dalinar or Navani who cried out—nor was it the real Wit she\npassed, but a giggling mess of self-aware Investiture egging her on. She\ngave everyone the briefest explanation of needing an emergency stop at the\nwashroom, then made for her mother while holding up the skirts of her\nenveloping blue dress.\nChana … her mother saw her coming. With eyes wide, the woman\nducked out the rear door. But there weren’t many places to go, this high in\nUrithiru. Shallan soon cornered her mother in an empty room, lit by natural\nsunlight from outside. Chana faced the window with a panicked expression\n—hands pressed against the glass. Wishing, it seemed, to force her way\nthrough.\n“Mother,” Shallan said from the doorway. “Please.”\nChana glanced over her shoulder. Storms. Shallan had seen her several\ntimes in the visions of the past, wearing furs, with the bearing of a soldier. It\nwasn’t that her mother was a Herald. That was overwhelming, yes, but not\npainful. Whereas seeing the woman again … that hurt. Made Shallan want\nto run back to the warm wedding room. Avoid the confrontation.\nNo, Radiant said. You said it’s time. Fight.\n“Fight for me,” Shallan whispered.\nNot this time, Shallan. Not this time.\n“Mother,” Shallan said, steeling herself. “Why are you here?”\n“I …” Chana whispered, tears in her eyes. “I heard that the Radiants had\nreturned. That you were one. I came, and found a wedding. I didn’t want to\ninterfere. I just … wanted to see you again …” The woman sank to the\nfloor, then pulled herself over into the corner, away from the window and\nShallan. She huddled there, rocking back and forth, hands up to her face,\nfingernails digging into her cheeks.\n“I didn’t want to hurt you,” she said, “but Ishar said I would. I wanted a\nfamily. I wanted … Selfish. So selfish. I …” She moaned, the sound\nbecoming a soft wail of agony as she clawed at her face, trembling and\nweeping."

I …” She moaned, the sound\nbecoming a soft wail of agony as she clawed at her face, trembling and\nweeping.\nShallan stood rooted in place, aghast as it slowly sank in. She, Shallan,\nwas the healthy one by comparison. She … she was the adult in the room.\nPain. Pain … Shallan could handle, with Veil and Radiant as strengths in\nher mind. Like pillars holding up the sunlight. Shallan wiped her eyes, then\napproached, aware that this woman—though unarmed—might have access\nto a Shardblade or even an Honorblade. It was only a vision, and probably\nsafe, but she still kept one eye on her mother’s hands as she knelt.\n“Mother,” she whispered. “It’s all right.”\nDid she feel that? Or were they just words? Emotions were a firestorm\ninside Shallan—anger, frustration, fear. Heat, all of them. So very hot, as if\nto burn her away and leave nothing but cinders. But then Chana looked at\nher, lifted a trembling hand, and put her fingers against Shallan’s cheek.\n“I wish I hadn’t hurt you,” Chana said. “Ishar and Nale told me it was a\nmistake to marry, but I thought I was well. I think … I think all of us make\nthat mistake, even Ishar.”\n“I know what happened,” Shallan whispered.\n“We return,” Chana said. “I went to Braize … and I broke. I tried to hide,\nI tried to last! But oh, I broke. This is me, this is all me! Everything that is\nhappening is my fault! A new Desolation …” She closed her eyes and\npressed her face against the wall again, moaning.\nAnd Shallan …\nShallan felt the heat radiating through her, and made a decision.\n“Mother,” she whispered, “you can’t blame yourself for what others do. You\ncannot take responsibility for their choices. If the enemy attacks, it is not\nyour fault.”\n“And what I did to you?” Chana hissed. “I thought … I thought you’d\nreplace me. So selfish. Even if it had been true, it would have been selfish\n…”\nShallan leaned back, the words bringing emotion, like a jolt of cold ice\namid the heat. Betrayal, a pain straight into her heart. Then … then slowly it\nmelted away. When she spoke—tears in her eyes—Shallan found the words\nwere not lies. Painful, yes, but not lies.\n“Mother,” Shallan said, “I forgive you.”\nChana hesitated, then glanced toward Shallan. “I don’t deserve that.”\n“I give it anyway,” Shallan whispered. “What you did was terrible. You\nwill need to be watched, helped, and prevented from hurting others. But I\nam safe now, so I can forgive you.”\nChana lowered her hands. “How could I, and the horrible thing I’ve\nbecome, create something so wonderful in you? Hug your brothers for me,\nShallan. Tell them I love them, even if I can never, ever see them again.\nLest I hurt them too.”\nThe heat settled. Maybe her mother didn’t deserve forgiveness—there"

Maybe her mother didn’t deserve forgiveness—there\nwas no excuse for what she’d done, no matter her mental state. Still, it was\nimportant for Shallan to make some kind of reconciliation, if only in this\nplayacting way.\nPattern stepped in, and then Testament. Chana’s eyes flicked toward\nthem, and she smiled. “You are in good hands. I should … I should have\nliked to have been with you, these years.” She glanced to the side and\njumped, seeing … nothing that Shallan could make out.\n“They’ve found me,” Chana said.\n“They?” Shallan asked, rising and stepping back, careful of what this\nerratic behavior might mean.\n“The souls of the dead singers,” Chana said. “The Fused who have not\nReturned. I’m looking for Taln—I won’t break this time. I will find him.”\nSouls of the dead …\n“Mother?” Shallan said. “Where am I, right now?”\n“Inside a vision,” Chana said, “in the Spiritual Realm. Reliving your\nwedding. I died again, a few months ago. I was on Braize, in the Cognitive\nRealm, but I felt you calling … pulling me to you …”\nIt was really her?\nChana stood up, suddenly alert. “Thank you for stopping me.” She met\nShallan’s eyes. “Do not trust any of us, except for Taln.”\n“Mother, you—”\n“I must go,” she whispered, then leapt forward and hugged Shallan. “I\nwill try not to break so easily this time.” Then her mother evaporated into\ncolorful shifting smoke.\nStorms! Shallan gasped, in and out, arms wrapped around herself, the\nsensation of her mother’s hug lingering. “Was that … the real her?”\n“Mmm …” Pattern said. “Rules are odd for Heralds, who are beings of\nall realms. I believe it was indeed her. A lie that became true.”\nShallan felt a hand on her shoulder. Testament, pointing with a\ntrembling, elongated finger. A shadow fell on the room somehow, though\nthe window still looked out on a sunny day.\n“He is here,” Testament whispered. “Odium.”\nThe vision broke apart, sending her back into chaos.\nDalinar screamed into the swirling chaos of the Spiritual Realm. He tried to\nfight it. Tried to offer up the strength that he’d found in taking the next step.\nThe power itself, not just Odium’s touch, taunted him. Humans could not\nbe trusted. Humans had broken Honor. None were worthy. It became a two-\npronged attack, the power of Honor cooperating with Odium, who forced\nDalinar to see failure after failure. Wearing down his resolve that he’d\nchanged, that he was a better man, that he’d been forgiven.\nFailing Gavilar on the night of his assassination.\nFailing Elhokar, who had needed an uncle, not a rival.\nShifting shapes assaulted him, as if he were somewhere dark, full of\nthunder, wind battering him.

A single door, metal and\nimposing, more plug than portal.\nA row of four beds against the back wall. Dalinar lay on one at the far\nend, and three blanketed lumps indicated the others were also occupied.\nLighting came courtesy of some spheres in a sconce on the wall, though a\ncloth had been thrown across it to provide shade.\nDalinar sat up, puffing, sweating. His heart thundered, and in his mind\nechoed the accusations of the dead. He checked his arm fabrial, but it had\nbeen shattered. It might already be too late. It probably was. He felt as if\nhe’d been in here for decades.\nHe tried to distract himself by inspecting this vision. The place seemed\nfamiliar; it had the look of a prison, with those uniform beds, the lack of\nwindows, and that imposing metal door. But what kind of prison had such\nnice sconces?\n“Father?” The next figure in the row of beds sat up, revealing a young\nboy that Dalinar didn’t recognize. “Please, Father. Make it stop.”\n“… Gav?” Dalinar said, and the boy looked at him, his eyes wide.\n“Daddy?” Gav said.\nYes, that was Gav, though he wore a different face. Dalinar hated the\nway these new visions didn’t let them truly see one another. Odium, trying\nto isolate them? Dalinar drew in a deep, relieved breath. “It’s me, son,”\nDalinar said. “I mean … me, Dalinar. Your grampa.”\nGav cringed, a motion that broke Dalinar’s heart.\n“What is this place?” Gavinor said, clutching the blanket. “I want to go\nhome. I want to go home!”\n“It’s all right,” said a familiar, lightly accented voice. The figure in the\nthird bed stirred, revealing a mess of blond hair and a pale face, tear streaks\nstaining her makeup.\nEvi.\nOh …\nOh, Damnation.\n“Evi?” he whispered.\nShe sat up, cocking her head. “Yes? Your name was … Hakin? Hakon?\nI’m sorry, it’s been a long night.”\nDalinar felt strangely thin, his emotions distant, his thoughts flimsy—\nlike he was a shadow cast by a man. So. This was how Odium intended to\nbreak him. He said he’d moved forward … but was he ready for this? For\nher. He could have sworn he’d heard her voice at Thaylen Field. But …\nOh no.

The eyes of the Blackthorn, cutting through it all. Red\nlike blood. The eyes of a man who, after years of restraint, had finally given\nin and become the thing everyone said he was. The thing his brother wanted\nhim to be.\nA destroyer.\nBut Dalinar was not afraid. He no longer feared the past, and Odium had\nmade a mistake in bringing him here.

He\nwas a man who did not care what they revealed.\nHe stepped from the fires and confronted the Blackthorn on a ledge near\nthe top of Rathalas, the city known as the Rift—a place with buildings\nconstructed down along the inside of a chasmlike valley. Many buildings\nburned; archers shot at the residents from above; those refugees who fled at\nthe bottom of the Rift were to be slaughtered by Dalinar’s armies.\nIt was a funeral pyre for the innocent.

An excellent\nofficer who, because of this day, would walk away from the army and\nbecome an ardent.\n“New orders!” Dalinar shouted. “Kadash, I want the archers on the rim\nto stand down. Tell the troops at the bottom of the Rift to step aside and let\npeople pass freely. Gather all of our troops and set them to putting out fires\nand helping the Rifters escape the flames. This is no longer a retribution. It\nis a rescue.”\nKadash and the other troops paused, looking from Dalinar to the\nBlackthorn.\n“Which of us,” Dalinar said softly, “do you want to be the real Dalinar,\nson?”\nKadash looked to him, stood up taller, and began passing the orders. But\nthen he hesitated. “Sir … it’s too late, isn’t it? The city is aflame. The\nsoldiers below have already started the massacre.”\n“It’s never too late,” Dalinar said, “to try to be a better man. Do what\nyou can.”\nKadash ran off, shouting to stop the killing, as did the others. Dalinar\nturned toward a burning building to try to rescue the citylord and his family,\nbut the Blackthorn stepped in front of him.\n“You cannot ignore me,” the Blackthorn said. “I am you.”\n“Yes …” Dalinar replied. “And no.”\nThe Blackthorn raised Oathbringer to strike.\n“See,” Dalinar said. “Know.”"

The\nBlackthorn’s eyes came alight with understanding as he saw the future—\nsaw himself breaking, saw Gavilar die. Dalinar poured into this effigy every\npain, every ounce of understanding, and the truth of who he had become.\nThe Blackthorn gasped, and fell to his knees.\n“Now what you said is true,” Dalinar said.\n“You realize,” Odium said, the sound vibrating through Dalinar, “this is\nmeaningless. None of this is real. What you do is performative.”\n“Then enjoy the show,” Dalinar said, dashing for the burning building.\nBut before he reached it, a figure in Shardplate came running to intervene.\n“Dalinar?” Sadeas demanded. “What in Damnation are you—”\nDalinar punched him across his helmeted face, an excellent right hook,\ncarrying with it decades of frustration and strength. The fist blasted through\nthe Plate helmet, shattering it, and cracked across Sadeas’s too-red, too-\npuffy, too-smug face.\nSadeas dropped like a lead bar, crashing to the floor in a heap of Plate.\nThat one … that one felt good.\nOdium sighed. “You aren’t performing only for me, Dalinar. Honor’s\npower watches, and you just showed it something.”\n“That even I can change?”\n“That men don’t deserve Honor, for they disobey orders.”\n“I’m saving lives!”\n“Traitors. What does the power of oaths care for lives, Dalinar? You, in\nall your self-righteous posturing, just broke your oath of commission to do\nas the king orders. Your job was to quell the rebellion in this city. Burning\nthis place down, to make a statement—that was the right choice. I wanted\nyou to see that.”\nIn an instant, the vision shattered into fragments of light; he lost Gavinor\nagain. His heart trembled for the boy, but he stood up tall before the tempest\nthat followed.\n“You feign strength,” Odium said, “but you still hurt from that day. And\nyou always will. Because that part of you knows it was necessary. You took\nthose pains deliberately.”\nThat voice. Was it …\nThe tempest whipped at Dalinar. Seeking to overwhelm and destroy him.\nThat he could stand, but suddenly images of burned people began to form.\nHis earlier strength seemed a lie as he stumbled, then huddled before those\nsights: image after image of the dead. Because it was true. For all his\nposturing, his changes in himself didn’t restore to life the burned corpses of\nthe children he had killed.\nThat was his burden. And his shame.\nPerhaps that was what was guiding these visions. Not only Odium, but\nhis own conscience, beaten bloody by his past and now thirsting for\nvengeance.\nFor he found his resolve crumbling, and found himself weeping as he\nsaw those corpses. Including Evi’s. He was a different man now, but could\nanything ever make up for such a terrible thing as he’d done? It was so\nhorrific that seeing it now, he had to acknowledge that any punishment"

He deserved it.\n“You must find the most important words a man can say.”\nA voice. Upon the currents of this place.\nHe … he knew that voice. Dalinar searched in the chaos. It wasn’t\nGavilar, or Elhokar, or the Stormfather …\n“Those words came to me from one who claimed to have seen the future.\n‘How is this possible?’ I asked in return. ‘Have you been touched by the\nVoid?’ The reply was laughter. ‘No, sweet king. The past is the future, and\nas each man has lived, so must you.’”\n“Nohadon?” Dalinar whispered. “Is that you?”\n“You will love,” the haunting voice continued. “You will hurt. You will\ndream. And you will die. Each man’s past is your future.”\n“Then what’s the point?” Dalinar begged. “Why? Must everything I do\nhave no meaning because of the terrible choices I once made?”\n“Ah, Dalinar,” the voice said. “Listen. Remember. The question is not\nwhether you will love, hurt, dream, and die. It is what you will love, why\nyou will hurt, when you will dream, and how you will die. This is your\nchoice. You cannot pick the destination, only the path.”\n“The path,” Dalinar whispered, “is filled with pain.”\n“Your pain.”\n“Yes.”\n“Your pain,” the voice said. “All men have the same ultimate destination,\nDalinar. But we are not creatures of destinations. It is the journey that\nshapes us. Our callused feet. Your callused feet. Our backs strong from\ncarrying the weight of our travels. Your back strong from carrying the\nweight of your travels. Our eyes open. Your. Eyes. Open. You kept the pain,\nDalinar. Remember that. For the substance of our existence is not in the\nachievement, but in the method …”\nThe voice drifted away. Dalinar heaved himself to his feet. “Please don’t\nleave me!”\nA shadow emerged from the chaos. As tall as a mountain, as wide as the\nhorizon. It fell on Dalinar, dominating him. A force. That spoke with …\nwith Taravangian’s voice.\n“Dalinar, my old friend,” the voice said. “Who are you calling for? The\nStormfather? Navani?”\nDalinar collapsed to his knees before the shadow. And knew the truth.\nTaravangian …\nStorms. Taravangian was the new Odium.\nSo many things suddenly made sense. It was a piece he’d been missing.\nAnd it terrified him. For he could think of no person worse—not even the\nman Dalinar had once been—to hold this power.\nStorms.\n“You could have been spared this torture,” Taravangian said, his voice\nvibrating with the force of a thousand drums. “My predecessor offered to\ntake your pain, but you refused. So now you must suffer.” The shadow\nformed into the old man, standing before him, but with the …\nincomprehensible scope of a god.\nTaravangian.\nOdium.\nThey were doomed."

Yet it must be.”\nBut I … Dalinar thought. I did not give him my pain.\nHe looked down at his chest and found a single glowing, golden light\nforming there. A line Connecting him to something. He touched it and felt\nagony. The pain of failure. The sharp, terrible agony of not just having lost\npeople you loved, but having caused that death. Through inaction. Through\nmisguided intention. And finally, worst of all, through deliberate choice.\nAnd nothing one could do could ever make up for those awful decisions.\nIt was a unique kind of misery. Dalinar knew it so, so well.\nHe seized that line of light, the agony vibrating through him. He used the\nvery pain that Odium thought would crush him as a lifeline. Dalinar took\nhold of it in one hand and began pulling himself through the chaos on hand\nand knees.\n“Dalinar,” Odium said. “Dalinar, I can end this.”\nDalinar found his feet, and started walking. Each touch on the line of\nlight was anguish. He kept going.\n“Do you know where that leads, Dalinar?” Odium said. “That path is\nonly to more pain! You need to listen to me. I will show you. I\nWILL PROVE\nI !”\nTO YOU THAT AM RIGHT\nHolding to that terrible pain, back bent, hands trembling, Dalinar pulled\nhimself away from the shadow and stepped—with a surprised stumble—\ninto a vision. A small stone chamber with a tiny window. Like … a\nmonastery cell? Yes, the dark rooms where they kept the unhinged, away\nfrom light and stimulation.\nA figure huddled against the wall in one corner, shaking and weeping\nsoftly. Dalinar’s line of light led straight to him. Dalinar approached and\nknelt beside the figure, who proved to be an older man, with a stern full\nfigure, a full beard. Dalinar recognized the face, though it no longer\nspanned an entire sky.\nThe Stormfather. So small now, as if mortal.\n“You liar,” Dalinar hissed.\nThe Stormfather continued to huddle by the wall, his eyes squeezed shut.\nAnd storms, Dalinar felt his anger evaporating. Again he was reminded how\nhe confronted problems: punch them, break them, burn them down.\nJourney before destination.\nHe needed to try something different. Still on his knees beside the\nStormfather, he hesitantly put a hand on the spren’s shoulder. The pain\nflared. That all-too-familiar agony of failure and loss.\n“You feel it too,” Dalinar said. “That’s what led me to you, isn’t it?”\nThe Stormfather shivered, the floor before him stained with tears. “I\nremember, Dalinar,” he said. “As you accused me, I remember what …\nHonor did. I know his whole life. I’m an echo of him. And his failings are\nmine.”\n“Show me,” Dalinar said.\n“You’ll hate me,” the Stormfather whispered, his voice raw, ragged."

I … I …”\n“Show me,” Dalinar said softly. “So that I can understand.”\nThe Stormfather blinked open tear-reddened eyes and looked at him. “It\nhurts.”\n“Maybe that’s the point. Maybe emotions don’t make us weak. Maybe\nthey teach us. Like the pain of touching a hot stove. They show us what we\nshould do, and remind us what we should not.”\nFrom the outside, Dalinar was a monster. How would Honor look from\nthe inside? Did Taravangian, or Odium, realize what he’d done in\nreminding Dalinar of his pain?\nNo. Taravangian saw only destinations.\n“You’ll hate us—me, Honor—for what we did.”\n“No,” Dalinar replied. “Understanding has never led to hatred. Show me.\nI cannot take your pain, but I can help you carry it.”\nThe Stormfather reached up to touch his hand to Dalinar’s.\nA new vision began. And in this one, Dalinar saw the life of a god.\nTHE END OF\nDay Eight\nYes, but will they keep to it?” Brakt asked, gesturing to the small stack of\npages in her hand.\n“They’re Alethi,” Ytredn replied. “If you get it on paper, it’s as good as\nan oath to them. I think they will keep to what they’ve promised. They\nmust.”\nThe two stood with Rysn on the lift, heading up to the middle floors of\nUrithiru. Chiri-Chiri snuggled in her lap, as large as a small axehound these\ndays. The larkin was constantly frustrated that she couldn’t hide in little\nboxes or pots of grass any longer. The number of times Rysn had been\nforced to yank her out of a hole she’d wedged herself into …\nThose in the tower gave the creature curious looks, as well they should.\nRysn had heard more than a few compare Chiri-Chiri to a chasmfiend with\nwings, though she was leaner than that, and had a segmented tail ending\nwith a bulbous bit and then a pointed hook. She looked, really, like nothing\nelse alive.\nThey gave Rysn’s floating chair equally odd looks, even if that\ntechnology was becoming well known. Though they didn’t know the half of\nit. For now, she didn’t show off its newer functions, and just rode the lift\nwith the two senior members of the Thaylen Patent Office.\n“Why do you question, Brakt?” Rysn asked as the lift locked into place\non the appropriate floor. “If we have a contract, we have a contract, don’t\nwe?”\nThe woman, with silvering hair and a stiff formal blue vest, walked\nbeside Rysn—who moved her chair by touching a gemstone control on the\narmrest. It floated along, high enough for her to look people in the eyes.\n“We have spent literally decades,” Brakt said, “trying to get the Alethi\nand the Azish to agree to our patent requirements. I find it …\nuncharacteristic of them to agree so suddenly to our demands.”"

I find it …\nuncharacteristic of them to agree so suddenly to our demands.”\n“They’re our allies now,” Ytredn said, waving with one hand, his\neyebrows pulled back along his head and tied behind with a silver ribbon.\n“A lot of things are changing.”\nThat wasn’t quite what Rysn had heard. She’d heard that during the\noccupation of Urithiru, which had ended two weeks past, Navani had\nbullied several very important Thaylen artifabrians into sharing trade\nsecrets—and they, after the occupation, had immediately bullied her into\nfinally agreeing to Thaylen patent wording. Vstim said that Navani had\nsigned—but under duress, during a time of great turmoil and stress in the\ntower following the occupation. Her babsk cursed the artifabrians who had\npushed for it so quickly. He worried there might be legal precedent for\ngetting the treaty thrown out.\nHe concurred, though, that it was better to test the treaty now. And so\nRysn was here. Her homeland was under threat, but she could do nothing\nfor them. War seemed constant these days, but life went on. She rested her\nhand on Chiri-Chiri, scratching at a small patch of skin between plates of\ncarapace—which earned a buzzing of pleasure from the beast.\nThey reached the proper room, and she halted her chair outside to await\nthe meeting time. Then, with her eyes closed, Rysn let herself feel.\nShe was growing better at controlling, or at least dealing with, the\nexpanding powers given by … her special duty. Life sense, as the Sleepless\ncalled it, was the ability to feel living things—the bits of power that made\nup all of them, and constituted a soul. Sounds were different to Rysn now,\nas she could pick out notes exactly—and sometimes got lost in\nconversations because she was paying attention to the musicality of the\nlanguage. And colors … she had finally managed to keep her mind from\ncomparing shades of color the moment she looked at something, but it\ncould still be distracting.\nIt all mixed to make life a little more overwhelming than it had been.\nThe Sleepless called it “merely the surface-level gifts your duty bestows.”\nThey said to appreciate and welcome them, so she tried.\n“Time,” Brakt said.\nRysn felt the Alethi scholars join them before she opened her eyes, and\ncould have placed each one distinctly. Together, they entered the meeting\nroom, and the ardents gathered around her. Not Rushu or any that Rysn\nknew; these were more mid-level bureaucrats than scientists, though they\nadministered Queen Navani’s various programs.\nRysn glanced from Brakt to Ytredn. Both of the patent officials nodded.\nSo Rysn took out her list of demands and presented them to the gathered\nofficials.\nThey’d been warned, but as they read her papers, they looked more and\nmore indignant. “These are impossible,” one woman at the front said at last.\n“This is too much.”\n“Your queen signed the deal,” Rysn said.\n“It’s not retroactive,” the woman said. “We’re free to make use of the"

The basic functions\nweren’t stunning anymore—artifabrians had been making things hover for\nyears. The biggest and most difficult rock to crack had been how to have\nlateral movement when hovering, as the mechanics of conjoined fabrials\nhad—up until recently—forbidden that. Rysn had been a big part of how\nthat had been overcome, with the help of the Windrunner Huio, who was\nher business partner—and who was also named in her demands.\nThe Alethi, of course, had immediately taken her design and weaponized\nit—that was the Alethi way. The flying machine, the Fourth Bridge, was the\nresult. But it had limitations.\nRysn flipped a switch on her chair, and it hovered sideways. Then she\nmade it do a little circle of the room. She was no scientist herself, but deep\ndown every merchant was a bit of a showman. So, using her control stick,\nshe soared the chair upward while moving sideways, then down in a little\ndip and bump. Finally, she came to rest in front of the scholars, hovering a\nfoot off the ground.\n“That is …” the lead ardent said, “admittedly far smoother than anything\nwe’ve managed. How are you so quickly switching between gemstones?\nWhat’s powering such calm and steady movement on that small of a scale?”\n“No chull track, I’ll tell you that,” Rysn said. “We’ve achieved speeds—\nwithout me in the seat, of course—of up to seventy-three knots.”\nTheir eyes bulged at this.\n“How?” one of the other ardents asked.\nRysn looked to her companions.\n“So, you want to be in business or not?” Brakt asked, stepping forward.\n“If you do, we need to talk about how this time you’re not going to infringe\nmy client’s patents, and how the Alethi and Urithiru governments owe her\nand her business partner—one Huio of Calipa—the demanded royalties\nupon every device they’ve begun creating that uses her proprietary\ndesigns.”\n“You’d put a price on scientific advancement?” a male ardent demanded.\n“You’d lock such valuable information behind a wall of filthy\nmercantilism?”\nRysn sighed. Fortunately, the other two were used to dealing with this\nsort of thing.\n“Before the implementation of a patent system in Thaylenah,” Ytredn\nsaid, right hand to his breast in a kind of salute, “each important discovery\nwas held back by the inventor, for fear of their ideas being poached. Even\nstill, we have problems with guilds maintaining secrets far beyond what is\nbeneficial.\n“A fair and reasonable patent system exists not to lock discoveries away,\nbut to encourage them to come into the light; we assure inventors that their\nideas will be valued and respected. We do not hide information. We\nencourage its sharing, just as any good legal code encourages good"

We\nencourage its sharing, just as any good legal code encourages good\nbehavior.”\nThe lead ardent huffed. But the creation of the Fourth Bridge was indeed\na sign that sharing information could lead to much greater discovery. As\nlong as she had a say in how it went. With the military in charge, she\ndoubted time would ever be devoted to such a presumably low-level need\nas mobility devices.\nBut with the patent in her control, she’d make it happen. She settled back\nin her chair as the officials slowly talked the bureaucrats into signing a\nratification of the treaty—something Vstim said would strengthen their\ncase. Then, with Rysn’s permission, they began laying out the schematics\nfor the intricate gemstone-changing device that let her chair have such\nsmooth flight. That included the specifics of the gravity- and ocean-wave-\nbased propellant prototypes, both of which were far more efficient than\nsimply having a track of chulls move your ship.\nRysn laced her fingers, listening, pleased. She’d dreamed of being a\nmerchant captain, and now had her own ship. She’d been trained to\nnegotiate trades around the world by one of the best. Who would have\nthought that her actual fortune would come not from the delivery of goods,\nbut as a result of wanting to be able to move her own chair on the ship’s\ndeck?\nAll was going well until Dalinar Kholin walked through the door. And\nthe power inside her went haywire.\nA surging ran through her, like a sudden storm on deck. The power of the\nDawnshard, her duty and her secret, started vibrating with a discordant\nnote.\nDalinar’s eyes locked on hers. His jaw dropped, and his image fuzzed\nbriefly. She immediately knew this was not actually the Blackthorn of\nlegend. Someone was imitating him.\n“Out,” the person imitating Dalinar said. “Everyone but the woman in\nthe hovering chair. Now.”\n“Brightlord?” an ardent said.\n“Now,” he repeated.\n“Go,” Rysn said to her attendants, trying to keep her voice from\ntrembling. Storms. The power felt like it was screaming. “I have business\nwith … with the Blackthorn. Private negotiations. I will be well.”\nThey seemed confused and concerned by this, with good reason. But\nthey did go, leaving Rysn in the chamber with the man who looked like\nBrightlord Kholin—until the door closed. Then his illusion fell apart,\nrevealing a shorter Shin man with white hair.\n“Who the hell are you?” he said.\n“I ask the same,” she replied. “You are not a Fused—which is good, as a\nMasked One almost killed me a year back. But what … why …”\nHe was another one. Like her.\nHe held one of the things, the duty and power. The man before her was a\nDawnshard.\nBut they were not supposed to be anywhere near one another. No two\nhad been placed on the same planet, and for very good reason.\n“I felt you the moment you entered the tower,” he said, “but didn’t know\nexactly what you were until now. You’ve found it?

Of course.”\n“Rysn,” Nikli said, stepping between her and the strange man, “do not\nspeak with this one. He isn’t what you think. He walked away from his duty\ncenturies ago. He held a Dawnshard once, but now merely bears echoes of\nit—”\n“No, Nikli,” Rysn said. “He is one. I can feel it. He is one of four that\nyou said should never meet. We are here. And we’re together.”\nNikli looked at her, then back to the strange man.\n“This is a secret,” the strange man noted, “that I’ve worked very hard to\nkeep.”\n“You took it up again?” Nikli demanded, stepping toward him. “You …\nThat’s why no one can find it. You gave it up, but then took it again at some\npoint, hiding it—because the signs would be dismissed as lingering\naftereffects of your long-standing tenure. Then … you brought it here to\nRoshar?

Even\nyou should know better.”\nNikli’s shape unraveled a little like it did when he was upset, the legs of\nthe cremling-like creatures that made him up poking through his skin.\nRysn hovered to the side, studying the man with the white hair.\n“How did I completely miss you?” he said, still meeting her eyes. “Who\nare you? How did this happen? Something this momentous should have\nshown up in …”\nHe trailed off as the powers within them started to align. The Sleepless\nhad explained to her what she held: a Dawnshard, one of the four core\nforces by which a god had been Shattered. Something beyond common\nSurges. Something primal.\nThe four had been divided up, never to be brought together, lest …\nLest this happen. The two started to pull toward one another. Rysn\ngasped, gripping the armrests of her chair as the power sought to pull her\nacross the room to smash into the force from the other man. She knew,\ninstantly, this would destroy her—she’d be made a flesh pulp by the\ncontortion of the forces in motion.\nShe strained, but was pulled out of the chair to the floor, dumping Chiri-\nChiri from her lap with a click of annoyance. The room began to vibrate.\nNikli, and her other Sleepless guard who had been sneaking up behind the\nstrange man, unraveled. Their separate hordelings lost cohesion as they fell\ninto mounds of scrambling bits. Chiri-Chiri writhed on the floor, the awful\nvibration making her screech.\nRysn scrambled to hold to the ground as she was pulled across the floor\ntoward where the man with the white hair was glowing.

They settled\ndown beside her, and Nikli helped Rysn sit up.\n“Well,” Rysn said, wiping the sweat from her brow, “what do we make\nof that?”\n“I can think of few people worse in all the cosmere to have discovered\nus,” Alalhawithador said. “But it is not your fault.

Over the time that Rysn had borne this burden, she\nthought maybe she’d started to earn their respect. That was manifest now, as\nAlalhawithador—who had once been harsh to her—spoke in a kindly way.\n“What would you like to do, Bearer?”\nRysn had Nikli help her back into her seat. She took a deep breath, again\nwiping sweat from her brow. “We need to go into hiding, don’t we? I have\n… I have to abandon my ship. My crew. Everything.”\nThe two looked down.

There was another\npurpose, of course, for these visions. As a god, everything he did had\nmultiple purposes.\nIn this case, he inspired pain. When Dalinar managed to briefly wrest\ncontrol of a vision, to try to avoid his agony, Odium isolated him and began\noverpowering him with painful truth. To break him down, so he could be\nrebuilt.\nThe power loved seeing that emotion in Dalinar.\nEverything was in hand. Until Dalinar vanished.\nSurprise. The power did not love that, but it accepted it. Complete,\noverwhelming, surprise.\nWhat had happened? Dalinar was nowhere in the Spiritual Realm—\nnowhere that Odium could see. Could someone hide from him that\ncompletely?\nThe answer was yes. They could. But it would take the act of a Shard.\nThe visions themselves were hiding Dalinar now?

Visions, for\nthat reason, were more stable when in this “region” of the Spiritual Realm.\nYet the power had been agreeing with Odium. Such as it could; but it\ndidn’t have true volition, did it? It didn’t care about anything other than\nfollowing its Intent, right? Odium investigated, furious at having his prey\nstolen, and found something unexpected.\nThe power of Honor had been too long without a host. It was becoming\ndangerous. It was coming alive. So Odium contemplated.\nShould he destroy it?\nTEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO\nI, G , .\nOD FOUND A WORLD UNMANAGED\nB , . T\nLUE AGAINST A BLACK SKY A GLOBE OF INFINITE POTENTIAL HIS WAS A NEW\n, I — A ’ .

That keeps with the spirit\nof the listeners.”\n“I’ll admit,” Kivor whispered, “a part of my soul is relieved to face this\nquestion at last. It was coming. Perhaps this is for the best—our people will\nno longer need to worry about the axe to our throats.”\n“We can’t,” Thude whispered. “Rejecting him is what defines us.”\nVenli settled down outside their circle. It was so strange to be here again.\nBeneath another darkened sky.

He demands my\nreturn.” She hesitated. “Venli, do you sense it?”\n“No,” Venli said, scooting forward. Cautious, Venli placed her hand on\nthe Fused’s shoulder. “But I can understand the relief that might come from\njust … returning to him, and no longer feeling rejected—or afraid.”\nLeshwi looked at her hand, then back at Venli. This was an interaction\nthat once would have been brazen. Comforting a Fused? Heresy.\n“I have found,” Venli said, “that I no longer need to be afraid.”\nAfter a moment, Leshwi hummed to Resolve.\n“Still,” Kivor said. “The Five need to make a choice.”\n“If we join this battle,” Bila said, “they’ll use us as fodder at the front of\ntheir final assault. Us and the chasmfiends. We’ll be slaughtered.”\n“But if it gains you peace for the rest of your people?” Leshwi asked.\n“We cannot resist a force such as Odium alone. Is this not a worthy\nsacrifice?” With her elevated way of talking—her accent harking back to\nthe ancient days—it was difficult not to agree with her; she projected\nauthority.\nThough Venli could understand the allure, she was revolted by the offer.\nThe others seemed the same, even those who had spoken in favor of\naccepting it. They glanced at one another, humming to uncomfortable\nrhythms.\nVenli wished she had something that would give them solace. But who\nwas she? She had bent like a twig to his will. She had …\n… sworn oaths to seek freedom. To help those in bondage. An idea\noccurred to her. A desperate, dangerous idea. A counterpoint to what she’d\ndone years before.\nTimbre thrummed. Excited.\n“Five, if I may speak?” Venli said, as a plan formed in her mind.\nNavani was lost in a nightmare.\nShe knelt on the ground before a low table, sweating, surrounded by\nlaughing women. They mocked her as she struggled with the written word,\nsounding out each letter.\nShe was eleven, and had come with her father to the city of Shulin to do\nbusiness, including a need to settle their family accounts. Her family grazed\nkevah: midshelled beasts that had been cultivated for their gemhearts useful\nin Soulcasting meat. Their flesh wasn’t too bad either, and they could graze\non flat land, the worst type for farming because of water stagnation.\nThey paid now for animals purchased the year before. Ranching was a\nfine living for a lighteyed family who happened to own some cheap land—\nbut it was not well regarded for a man of her father’s dahn.\nTime with her father out on hunts or riding the ranch hadn’t been good\nfor Navani’s studies.

With\neffort, she wrote out the final lines of the contract. She sat up, then listened\nto the women read, finding her spelling amusing.\nNavani hated coming to the city. Hated feeling ignorant.\n“Child,” a kindly lesser scribe said, leaning down. “Why not let another\nmore experienced handle this?”\n“We only have three scribes,” she said. “One’s having a baby soon. The\nother two are seeing to our local accounts.” What Navani did here was a\nformality—they needed the good scribes to ensure nobody was embezzling.\n“Your mother?” the scribe asked.\n“Mother left,” Navani whispered. “Divorced us.”\nThe women shared glances. It wasn’t impossible—the right of travel was\na divine blessing granted to all but lower-nahn darkeyes, enshrined in Alethi\ncommon law for centuries. No person could be forced to work, or live, in\none place.\nYet a divorce wasn’t considered proper. Leaving wasn’t a problem, mind\nyou, but why cancel a marriage? Navani’s mother had too much dignity to\nleave without officially divorcing, but not enough dignity to maintain\ncontact with her daughter.\nThe laughter turned demonic, and insults started to fly, beating on her\nlike lashes.\nIgnorant.\nIncapable.\nIdiot.\nThe young Navani, crushed by the experience, had fled, crying. She\nhadn’t felt like herself for weeks afterward. This had been one of the central\nmoments in her life when … when she’d known … a girl like her couldn’t\never be …\n“Lies,” she whispered, looking up. “Repackage them as you wish. I\nknow them now for what they are.”\nSuddenly the nightmare had no teeth. The laughter took on a frantic air,\nthe women annoyed to be ignored.\n“This seed was buried deep, wasn’t it?” Navani whispered. “Grew into a\nweed that snarled and choked me for decades, watered by Gavilar once he\nrecognized it. I’ve pulled that weed. Its power withered as its roots died.\nBegone.”\nThe vision popped, and she was cast into the chaos.\nShe hunkered down against the flashes of visions—of other times in her\nlife when she’d been mocked, undermined, attacked. And she started\nthinking clearly. She wasn’t certain how long she’d been adrift in this place\n—she cursed herself for not insisting she have a clock like Dalinar’s, but\ntheir visit to the Spiritual Realm was supposed to have been a quick test.\nShe put that failing aside. She needed to find Gavinor, then Dalinar, then\nget out. Unfortunately, she could see no lines of Connection. Something\nwas different now. And Navani …\nNavani saw a pattern to it.\nPatterns were one of the pillars of science. And she was a scientist. She\nhad gone toe-to-toe with Raboniel and won.

Not about herself, but\nabout them.\nEver since the vision where Mishram had been captured, she’d been\nswimming through possibilities, and they should have been random. Instead\nthis had been the fourth in a row of escalating intensity and pain. She\nrefused to believe that she was causing her own torment; she was clearly\nbeing directed toward painful moments.\nShe stood up amid the chaos, like a terrible wind blowing past with\nstreams of colorful smoke and mist that briefly took the shapes of people or\nevents. It tugged at her clothing and her hair, which had come loose from its\ncustomary braids and bun. Perhaps this was Odium, or maybe it was\nDalinar. He had been feeling raw and vulnerable, falling back—regrettably\n—to old foibles. Perhaps his pain—and worry for the upcoming contest—\nwas somehow dominating the visions, creating echoes that sent her into her\ndarkest days.\nI am a scholar, she thought. And I will test hypotheses. My visions have\nbeen escalating. Which means …\nAs the next started to form, she guessed it would be Gavilar. On one of\nthe days near the end, when they’d fought constantly. The vision came\ntogether: her study in the palace of Kholinar. She knew, without needing to\ncheck the calendar on her desk, what day it was. Her books were out, and\nshe was working on an essay about the Parshendi, recently discovered on\nthe Shattered Plains.\nShe wanted to remain logical, but … this room brought up so many\nmemories. Kholinar, now lost to them, the palace controlled by the Fused.\nThis room likely no longer existed. She stood in a beautiful figment of her\npast.\nShe walked to the bookshelf and ran her fingers over Light and\nGemstones by Chanosha, then the six-volume Artifabrication by Britt the\nGood. Navani’s copies had been worn when she acquired them, as these\nwere old books with faded pages and cracking covers, purchased by a\nyoung Navani during the years when she’d first started spending time with\nGavilar, Dalinar, Torol, and Ialai. Days when they’d dreamed of conquering\nthe world, and she’d dreamed of conquering herself.\nThere, in a spot along her shelf of knickknacks, she found a wooden …\nsomething … made by Elhokar when he’d gotten his first whittling knife as\na boy. He’d called it a skyeel, she thought. He’d been embarrassed, years\nlater, that she’d kept it. Yet she smiled whenever she saw it, and the small\nscrapbook of poems and stories written by Jasnah during her youth, when\nshe’d been determined to learn how to write those fun adventure tales that\nwomen liked to read. Those embarrassed Jasnah more than the wooden\nskyeel had Elhokar, and Navani had been sensitive enough to hide them.\nShe had been made to feel ashamed of her scholarship; she would not do\nthe same to her daughter.\nOdd, Navani thought, trailing through the room. Each time, the vision\nlets me settle in for a moment before hitting me with the painful part. Like it\nwants me to experience joy, before smashing it.\nIt seemed so deliberate. She was able to guess, almost to the second,"

She was able to guess, almost to the second,\nwhen she would first hear Gavilar’s footsteps in the hall. She turned,\ncompletely unsurprised when he burst through the door and slammed it\nshut.\nSeeing him hurt. From the outside, he was exactly the man she’d always\nwished to marry. A regal king, like from the olden days. Any historian could\nhave warned her those kings from the olden days had almost universally\nbeen vile human beings.\n“Did you tell Elhokar,” he demanded, his eyes seething, “that he\nshouldn’t marry Aesudan?”\n“So I was right,” she said. “It’s that argument.”\n“How dare you? We need this union; you know how I’ve worked for it.\nElhokar would have married that nobody scribe, if not for me.” He didn’t\nraise his voice, but lowered it, exuding a sense of dangerous control.\n“I wonder,” Navani said. “Was I too hard on Aesudan? I remember\nundercutting her time and time again. I didn’t like the girl, but did I need to\ninsult her?”\nGavilar strode around the desk to come right up next to her. “You\nundermine my authority.”\n“I assert my authority.”\n“You will make me look bad before the highprinces.”\n“I learned long ago, Gavilar,” she said, “queen or not, I can’t make you\ninto anything. If you look bad before anyone, it’s merely because I’ve\npulled the curtains back.”\nHe growled, then raised his hand.\n“Ah,” she said. “But he never hit me. If he does now, it will break the\nillusion, won’t it?”\nHe huffed, then spun, turning away from her.\nHer heart was racing—that slap had looked like it would really fall. But\nthen … had she just manifested control over this vision? She hadn’t been\nable to draw herself into a pleasant vision despite trying, but maybe that\nwas too big an alteration—perhaps she needed to try smaller things. Like …\nlike guiding an ornery chull. Stopping it was near impossible. But you\ncould turn it. How to test her theory?\n“Yes, he can’t hit me,” she whispered. “Physical pain would have\nbolstered me, provoked me to leave and escape his control. What he did\nwas in some ways worse. He undermined my confidence …”\nGavilar spun back toward her. “You think,” he said, “you belong at my\nside? You think you deserve to be a queen?”\n“Yes,” she said. “Like that.”\n“I build something grand,” Gavilar said, stalking toward her, “and you’re\nstill stuck—at least in your mind—on a backwater ranch, barely able to\nwrite your name.”\n“He didn’t know that about me,” she added. “By the time I knew him, I\nhad impressive penmanship and spelling.”\n“I build something grand,” Gavilar said, stalking toward her again, like\nan actor repeating his lines after flubbing them, “and you’re still stuck—in\nyour mind—on a backwater ranch, worrying about your insignificant father\nand his petty concerns.”"

You’re missing the nuance. The\ncareful gibes like pins—not daggers. The cold refusal to talk to me about\nimportant matters, as if insulting me wasn’t even worth his time. Gavilar\nwas a master of precision abuse.”\nThe simulacrum of Gavilar started pacing on the other side of the room.\nShe could steer this vision. Almost like … whatever was sending these had\nits attention mostly elsewhere, and had left this one to play out and torment\nher. Like Dalinar’s visions of the past, which had instructions on what to\nshow him, but no direct oversight.\nOr was she reading too much into this? Either way, she had tested her\ntheory. The next step was application. Could she use these visions to get\ninformation that would help Dalinar?\nNo, she thought. I need to find Gav first. Somewhere in here is a boy,\nterrified and alone.\nWhere would little Gavinor be?\nThe answer was obvious. If the poor child was in a vision like this, it\nwould be the one where he was tortured by evil spren while his mother\nhummed to herself.\nWait.\nThat had happened in the Kholinar palace.\nA different version of it, yes, but if Navani could steer this particular\nchull … could she find her grandson? Gavilar started talking again, but\nNavani ignored him. He was unworthy of her attention, and always had\nbeen.\nWhat if … she thought. Storms. That would hurt. Could she do it?\nStrength before weakness. She’d said the words. She needed to mean\nthem.\n“You know what would really hurt me?” she whispered. “If I was forced\nto watch what happened … what happened to Elhokar … at the end.”\nEach word was raw, because they were true.\nThat truth served her—because she was certain the vision could sense\nher sincerity. In a blink, Gavilar’s simulacrum puffed away, and the room\nchanged, dust appearing on the books. This was the palace that Aesudan had\nruled under the thrall of multiple Unmade.\nNavani opened the door, and heard shouts echoing in the hall. She’d\ndone it. This was the terrible day when her son had been killed.\nNINE AND A HALF YEARS AGO\nSzeth landed at the Elsecaller monastery at night.\nPozen’s monastery, where Szeth had lived the longest. His eyes naturally\nsought out the hallway window where he’d stood many a time staring out\ninto the night, holding a contraband woolen toy and longing for his mother.\nHe launched into the air, soaring up to the roof, and surveyed the lights\nof Mokdown beyond. A small, vibrant city, squashed between two rivers.\nDid any of the shamans who served beneath the Honorbearers know?\nSurely there couldn’t be hundreds of people involved in this conspiracy,\ncould there?\nHis mind still reeled.

He’d ignored\ninvitations to visit the other monasteries, but the letters he’d sent to Sivi and\nMoss—implying that they should join him—had gone unanswered.\nThe Return had come, right beneath their noses. How many\nHonorbearers had lived and died, fully in the grip of the very thing they\nwere meant to protect against? How many Tukos had there been?\nHonorbearers who didn’t quite buy in—their questioning leading to their\nremoval?\nNo more. He had begun gathering towns and cities to his cause. Before\nhe unleashed civil war, however, Szeth wanted to try other options. He was\nexploring one tonight. He slunk across the rooftop, glad for all the times\nthat Pozen had made him climb up here on his stupid quests. Szeth hated\nthis place. Hated it deeply—for forcing him to leave his mother behind, for\nmaking Elid abandon him.\nHere, Pozen had forged Szeth into a weapon. But a weapon could be\nturned on its masters, and Szeth was strong enough—because of their\ntraining—to do what needed to be done. For that, Szeth supposed, he should\nbe grateful.\nPozen used you as an assassin, he thought. He deserves this more than\nany of them.\nSzeth located the access hatch, and hesitated, thinking of his father, who\nhad vanished. Szeth had come back a day after visiting the Voice, only to\nfind the hidden camp empty, Neturo nowhere to be seen—with no signs or\nnotes left behind.\nHe feared his father had been taken hostage. If so … what would the\nprice be for Szeth’s decisions?\nNo, not a price, Szeth thought. You have to have a choice to pay a price.\nToday, I have no choice.\nToday, he would assassinate Pozen as the first step in war.\nSzeth sliced the lock off the access hatch with his Blade, then slipped in.\nThis hatch was a weak point, and shouldn’t have existed. Even Pozen,\ndespite his claims of orthodoxy, had grown soft. Stones Unhallowed … they\nall had.\nSzeth dropped into the hallway, cold despite the Stormlight raging inside\nhim. It was past curfew, when Pozen demanded his acolytes be in their\nquarters. But what would he do if he did meet some poor acolyte? He felt\nhorrible, sneaking through these once-familiar hallways. This subterfuge\nwas a similar tactic to what he’d done to those invading sailors years ago.\nTrickery, movement in darkness.\nThis wasn’t him, was it? He could win any fight directly, so why use\nstealth?\nA mercy, Szeth told himself. A Blade in the night is a mercy. Just a quick\nexcision of festering flesh, from the Blade of a surgeon. This proved it\nwasn’t about revenge for Szeth. It was only what had to be done. With\nPozen’s blade, Szeth would have Soulcasting. With that to feed his armies,\nhe could march on and overthrow the Bondsmith. With Pozen dead, the\nother Honorbearers might fold. He might not need to fight Sivi or Moss."

        "text": "he could march on and overthrow the Bondsmith. With Pozen dead, the\nother Honorbearers might fold. He might not need to fight Sivi or Moss.\nHis head buzzing with such thoughts, he was glad when he reached one\nof the meditation chambers, found it empty, and slipped inside. There—by\nthe light of a few amethysts—he tried to calm his rapid breathing, quiet his\nthundering heart. Luckily, he hadn’t been seen. He was fond of some of\nthose who worked this monastery. He’d have hated to …\nTo what? Would he really kill one of his friends?\nHe breathed a soft prayer to the room’s stone, a raw chunk of shale with\na sharp point toward the sky. Pozen liked to meditate in the night, after\ncurfew, when it was quiet. He usually picked one of the chambers farther\nalong the hallway. If Szeth was in luck, the man would come tonight. He\nwould be alone, and Szeth could do the deed.\nUnfortunately, Szeth soon heard a voice echoing in the hallway outside\n—but it didn’t belong to Pozen.\nIt was Sivi.\nSzeth went alert, his breath catching.\n“… can’t defeat him, Pozen,” she was saying. “None of us can.”\n“There is time yet,” Pozen replied. “Many of us find the Truth difficult at\nfirst. He is an obedient sort, Sivi. Give him more time. It has been only six\nweeks—you refused to speak to us for three months once you were\nelevated. Szeth will return and do as he is told.”\n“I think you underestimate him,” Sivi said.\n“Underestimate him? You think it is good he shows this rebellious\nstreak? Sivi, you know better.”\nShe didn’t reply. Szeth could hear them in the hallway just outside,\nseparated from him by a door woven of reeds and fronds. He summoned his\nBlade.\n“You question too much, Sivi,” Pozen said sharply. “Your loyalty\nbecomes suspect.”\n“What?” she said right by the door, the proximity making Szeth sweat.\n“You’ll do to me what you did to Tuko?”\n“Don’t be dramatic,” Pozen said. “You wouldn’t push us to that, Sivi.”\n“Don’t be dramatic?” she said, her voice rising. “We killed Tuko and\nreplaced him with someone far, far more skilled. He wrote to me,\nsuggesting I visit to speak with him about an important item—and the\nimplication was clear. He’s been talking to the garrisons of the cities nearest\nhim. This could become very, very bad.”\n“I will handle it,” Pozen said. “The Voice assures me that all is under\ncontrol—particularly with the specific leverage you made sure to get for us.\nHere. You wanted to meditate with amethyst light? These chambers will\ndo.”\nSzeth held in a curse. In a panic, he drew in the room’s Stormlight—a\nbad idea, as it could reveal he was here, but he couldn’t help himself. He\nLashed himself upward in the small chamber, toward the ceiling. Sivi,\nhowever, didn’t enter his meditation chamber—she entered the one next to\nhis.\nPozen retreated. Szeth heard his footsteps along the hallway. That"

That\nworried Szeth, until he realized that he’d been handed a gift. He could kill\nSivi and claim the Willshaper Blade, then strike against Pozen. When he\nhad both of their weapons, his armies would be that much better protected.\nHe wouldn’t have to worry about Honorbearers using Shadesmar to pop in\nunexpectedly, nor would there be any who could sculpt stone.\nHe’d be far from safe—there would be those who could Lightweave to\nworry about, not to mention the armies serving the others. But with three\nBlades …\nHe raised his weapon, preparing to break through the thin wall between\nalcoves. She’d be dead before she realized what was happening. Except …\nSivi?\nHis father genuinely seemed to love her, and had cried when it was time\nto part and continue the pilgrimage. It might have been a fling to her, but\nnot to Neturo. Plus, she’d treated Szeth so well.\nShe serves the Unmade, Szeth thought. She violates Truth, even while\nshe pretends to preach it.\nBut if he was wrong? This was all happening so quickly. Szeth looked\ndown at the stone in his room, wavering.\nA boy with a rock in his hand, blood dripping from it.\nBurning ships.\nA dying holy man in his arms, holding his shoulder as his life bled away.\nYes, Szeth could kill. They’d made sure of that.\nToday, he dismissed his Blade. He left the meditation chamber, walked\nto the adjacent one he’d heard Sivi enter, then strode in. He owed it to his\nown conscience to at least talk to her first. Szeth was not the man Pozen had\ncrafted him to be—he was more than that. He was a child of Neturo.\nChildren of Neturo asked questions.\nSivi turned. Her eyes went wide and she rose and backed against the\nwall, holding her hand out to the side. But she did not summon her Blade.\nShe did not scream for help.\n“Szeth,” she said. “We’ve … been worried about you. Are you here to\ntalk to Pozen? I assume you have … questions. It’s been a hard few weeks,\neh?”\n“Questions,” he said, stepping closer to her in the small room of prayer.\n“Yes, I have questions. One in particular. How, Sivi? How could you serve\none of the Unmade?”\nShe sighed. “You saw the captive spren, then?”\n“Captive and being tortured.”\n“I had hoped he’d come to you outside the cavern,” she said. “That was\nhow he spoke to me at first.”\n“I demanded the full truth.”\n“Then you got angry when he gave it to you?”\n“Sivi, this is what we trained to fight. The Unmade’s presence means the\nDesolation has begun. The world is in danger, and we’re not ready to fight\nit!”\n“Wait,” Sivi said. “What did you see, Szeth?” She frowned, her eyes\ndistant. “Could I … Could that be right? Could I have been deceived?\nThat’s the form I’d have chosen for a deception … but Szeth, it’s not—”"

Could I have been deceived?\nThat’s the form I’d have chosen for a deception … but Szeth, it’s not—”\n“What is this?” a voice demanded from behind.\nSzeth spun, immediately beginning the process of summoning his Blade.\nPozen stood in the hallway, as Szeth had foolishly left the door open. The\nolder Honorbearer carried a small tray of fruit.\nHad he … gone to fetch a snack for his meditation?\nRegardless, Szeth had been thinking about how easy it had been to sneak\nup on Sivi. Now he ate those words as he himself left his back exposed.\n“Szeth?” Pozen demanded. “Have you come to apologize? After all I did\nfor you, to have you pout like a child? You’ve embarrassed me.” Pozen\nlooked to Szeth’s hand, then his face. “No. You’re here for something far\nworse, aren’t you, Szeth?”\nTo his credit, Pozen didn’t run. He likely knew that the best chance he\nhad was in that moment—with Szeth trapped in a small room, a potential\nenemy to his rear. Pozen stretched his hand out for his Blade.\nSzeth didn’t wait for his weapon. He lunged forward into the hallway\nand grappled Pozen, who deflected his hands, Stormlight rising around him.\nSzeth Lashed himself away, soaring some distance down the hallway. It\nwouldn’t do for Pozen to transfer both of them to Shadesmar.\n“The ultimate betrayal,” Pozen said, then spat to the side. “You are a\ndisgrace, Szeth.”\n“I choose Truth,” Szeth said.\nPozen’s Blade appeared in his hand. And Szeth …\nSzeth retreated.\nHe would not be a killer who came in the night. If Szeth murdered Pozen\nhere, he knew he would never recruit Sivi or any of the others.\n“I have already told the Windrunner acolytes what I saw,” Szeth called\nthrough the hallway to them. “I have begun raising the banner of Truth,\nsince you will not. I will let it be known to any who will hear: It is time.\nThe Voidbringers have returned. If you would join me, I would welcome\nyou. If you will not … then I will fight you, Pozen. Sivi—even you.”\nWith that, Szeth fled.\nFear the old man who welcomed failure when young. If he has\nsurvived this long, he learned.\n—Proverbs for Towers and War, Zenaz, date unknown\nKaladin rose early on the ninth day and made breakfast. He wasn’t familiar\nwith the vegetables they’d bought at that village a few days back. Some\nkind of root, Szeth had explained—except here, instead of growing down\ninto cracks, roots dug into the soil. That just didn’t seem sanitary. He\nwashed the long orange things three times, and found they tasted\nremarkably good raw—slightly sweet, and with a solid crunch. So he cut\nthem and fried them in his travel skillet, and after they softened, a pinch of\nsugar enhanced their natural sweetness. And …\nStorms. Rock really had made a bit of a chef out of Kaladin.

        "text": "sugar enhanced their natural sweetness. And …\nStorms. Rock really had made a bit of a chef out of Kaladin. He\nchuckled at this, though it was difficult to maintain good humor under the\ncircumstances. He set out a plate for Szeth, who was meditating, then\nscooped the rest onto his own plate and settled on a nearby rock. He gazed\nout over the brownish-green landscape, with its hills and odd trees. In one\nof those an entire flock of chickens was roosting, bright red and green, and\nhe could hear them clucking from here.\nSyl settled down beside him. He was coming to like the way she went\nabout full sized these days; he could judge her expression and mood better\nthis way. Right now she slumped, wearing her modified and skirted\nuniform, elbows on her knees and chin in her hands as she floated half a\nfoot off the ground, hair drifting around her head as if she were underwater.\n“I don’t like this,” she said.\n“Nale leaving early,” Kaladin said softly. “‘Preparing’ things at the next\nmonastery.”\n“He’s a creep,” Syl said. “How are the toes?”\n“They’re called carrots.”\n“They look like people’s toes.”\n“Nobody has toes this long,” he said, eating. “And they’re good. Taste\nlike a breakfast my mother made.” He hesitated. “I put sugar on them, like\nMother always did for us kids. Rock really has corrupted me—he always\ninsisted there were more flavors than ‘hot’ and ‘very hot.’”\nSyl smiled, but clasped her hands in front of her, still concerned. So\nKaladin ate, then took out his flute and played for a little while, his fingers\nincreasingly comfortable holding the wooden instrument, calluses from\nwielding the spear finding a home with another kind of work.\nThe playing calmed him. And as it often did, the song brought the Wind.\nHe felt its attention—the unseen ancient spren who inhabited this land.\n“Any guesses on what I should expect?” Kaladin said. “Nale is\nobviously going to be waiting for us. This is the Skybreaker monastery, and\nhe bears the Honorblade. They’ve tried so many underhanded ways to kill\nSzeth. I worry this will be the worst.”\n“Because,” Syl added, “Nale is an utter creep.”\n“Please,” a quiet voice said. “Don’t speak of him like that.” The Wind\nstirred Kaladin’s hair, drifting past it.\n“He might have once been a hero as you showed me,” Kaladin said. “But\nWind, in my time Nale has been a source of only misery, death, and\nfrustration.”\n“He’s just weathered,” the Wind whispered. “Like that rock you sit\nupon.”\nKaladin frowned, shifting, looking at the stone beneath him. It was\nmerely a smooth round stone, maybe three feet across.\n“Like a rock?” Syl said. “Stubborn? Immovable?”\n“You are not those who speak with Stone,” the Wind whispered. “I do\nnot think you can hear its voice, even with my help. But touch it, Kaladin,\nSylphrena. I will try.”\nKaladin glanced at Syl, who stood as he did. Curious, he pressed his"

        "text": "Sylphrena. I will try.”\nKaladin glanced at Syl, who stood as he did. Curious, he pressed his\nhand to the stone, and she did likewise, her hand beside his. In a flash, he\nsaw something. An … impression. The Wind was right though. He could\nnot hear the voice of the stone, if it had one.\nBut he did see a beautiful statue of a woman. Full-figured, her arms\noutspread, gazing down at what had once been a road here. He did not\nknow who would have placed such a fine statue in such an out-of-the-way\nplace. Candles lit at its base made the site feel welcoming, like a waystop\nfor weary travelers.\nThen the years passed. He saw them in a rush. Rainstorm after rainstorm.\nHe felt the wind on the stone, and over time the statue weathered. The lines\nwore down, the detail vanishing, and then the features melted away. Years\nstole the statue’s shape like sandpaper until, by the repeated washing of\nstorms, it sank into the soil.\nThe impression faded. The stone Kaladin had been sitting upon had been\na masterwork thousands of years ago. Now it was just another lump of rock.\n“I told you,” the Wind said. “I love the Stones, and they are my sibling—\nbut my touch breaks them, ever so slowly. Nale is one of these stones,\nKaladin, Sylphrena. Time has weathered him away. But like this stone, a\npart of him remembers what he once was.”\n“The only time I’ve given him pause,” Kaladin said, hand pressed to the\nrock, “was yesterday, when I asked him why he became a Herald.”\n“Make him remember,” the Wind said. “Please. I know you do not care\nfor the Heralds, Sylphrena, and they were not perfect, even when they were\nwhole. Jezrien was proud, and Ishar thought himself above common people.\nPralla loved her secrets, and Battar could be conniving. Chana avoided\ntaking responsibility, and Nale could hold a grudge. But they were good\npeople.\n“And they tried. So very, very hard. Honor abandoned them to the\nweathering of time—but in some ways they are the best that remains of\nhim. A piece of an infinite god is still infinite, and the power within these\nnine … I think we will need it, in days to come. Try to see their potential,\nnot their faults.”\n“I’ll … try,” Syl said with a sigh. “I mean, I know what you’re saying is\nright. Hard to feel it though.”\n“It is hard for Nale to feel that way about himself too,” the Wind\nwhispered. “Please, Kaladin. Help him.”\n“I kind of have my hands full with Szeth,” Kaladin said, glancing to the\nside, where Szeth was returning from his meditations. “Don’t know if I\nhave time for another patient.”\n“But that,” the Wind said, “is why I brought you here.”\n“You said a storm was coming,” Kaladin said, recalling the first\nconversation he’d had with the Wind at Urithiru.\n“Yes,” the Wind said. “And they are the counter. Remember what the\nBondsmith said. I need you …”"

I need you …”\n“But Heralds?” Kaladin said. “Wind, that might be a little beyond my\nskill. I told Dalinar the same.”\n“You’ve already helped one who will soon be a Herald,” the Wind said,\nher voice fading. “It’s possible.”\nSzeth arrived, and … well, Kaladin did suppose he’d helped the man.\nSzeth actually smiled as he picked up the plate. “For me?”\n“Yes.”\n“Carrots for breakfast,” Szeth said, shaking his head. “Stonewalkers …\nyou have odd tastes.” He tried one. “Surprisingly good though. We should\npack up and go. I suspect Nin will be waiting for us. I can eat as we walk.”\nKaladin looked at Syl, who nodded in agreement. So he cleaned up, then\nfollowed Szeth onward—to the penultimate monastery. Wind blowing\nquietly along with them, and spren streaming in the sky like a highway of\nlight.\n“Hold the wall!” Sigzil shouted through the pouring rain. “Hold!”\nHe swept along behind the ranks of men, who stood on the wall as water\nstreamed down off the ramparts behind them. This persistent drizzle sank in\nwith a deep chill, slicking surfaces and ruining bowstrings, not to mention\nobscuring their view of the plateaus around them. Corrupted windspren\nwhipped past in the air, and the army faced a sea of red eyes staring out\nthrough the mist. Some among them unleashed a constant pounding of\nstones against the wall. Crashing rocks, smashing at the fortification—a\nterrible, erratic drumbeat that left Sigzil’s ears ringing.\nMen worked with halberds and spears along the top—amid striking\nrocks—their weapons pointed down at the Deepest Ones, bits of whom\npeeked out of the wall. To counteract the barrage of stones, the defenders\nhad used Stonewards to thicken the walls—but that made them wide\nenough for Deepest Ones to disappear into completely, popping out to\nattack the Stonewards behind it, who used their little remaining Stormlight\nto keep the fortification from falling apart.\nThe constant barrage was going to run them out within a few hours. The\nenemy, however, seemed to have as much Voidlight as they wanted. And\nSigzil still hadn’t been able to come up with an application of his plan that\nwould work.\nSigzil swooped along, trying to keep the soldiers protected. He had to\nhave troops on the walls, as the enemy periodically dropped attackers up\nhere. Indeed, something hit the wall nearby—something large. A Magnified\nOne hauled himself up over onto the wall top a second later, followed by\nanother. Sigzil cursed, forming his spear, and streaked toward them as they\nbegan battering soldiers away.\nHusked Ones followed—three appearing on the wall from their ribbons\nof light to support the massive Magnified Ones. Sigzil struck at the largest\nof the creatures, and his spear sank deep—but the Magnified One grew\nthick carapace, pushing him back away with a growth like an expanding\ncolumn of stone.

Sigzil’s spear never touched anything vital, and that\ncarapace grew at a furious rate in the storm, encasing his spear.\nSigzil was forced to pull back—lest his hands be captured in the\novergrown chitin—dismissing his spear. The Magnified One broke off this\nsegment of growth, like a tumor along its side, then swung for Sigzil with a\nhand that had become a large club. Sigzil ducked, then rushed at the Husked\nOnes—but was kept at bay by the Magnified One. The Fused did\nfrightening damage to the defenders before the Stormwall arrived and\ndistracted them. That finally gave Sigzil a chance to ram a spear straight\nthrough the back of a Husked One’s head. As the Fused collapsed off the\nwall into the rain, Sigzil lifted into the air, and noticed an encouraging flash\nof light from the next plateau over.\nHe flew toward it, but the two remaining Husked Ones zipped after him,\nbecoming lines of light that materialized into figures grappling him. One\nheld his arms back, immobilizing him as the other grabbed the front of his\nuniform, pulling him close.\n“We were promised a chance to fight your leader,” the creature hissed to\nhis face. “The one who defeated Lezian. Why does the Stormblessed not\ncome to meet our challenge?”\nSigzil grunted, and began Lashing the creature away—but it clung to\nhim, holding on tightly.\n“If I kill you,” the creature asked, “will Stormblessed chase me down for\nvengeance?”\n“You can’t kill me,” Sigzil hissed.\n“You think you’re too strong?”\n“No,” Sigzil whispered. “But I’ve heard the name of my killer screamed\non the lips of a dying man. And it’s not you.” With a grunt, Sigzil kicked the\ncreature free.\nThe Fused became a ribbon of light to return, but Sigzil was already\nLashing himself and the other Fused upward—carrying them into the\nmiddle of a storm of Light, a group that had just arrived via Oathgate.\nWindrunner reinforcements swarmed around, dozens of them attacking. The\nHusked One behind Sigzil let go with a curse, then was chased away.\nA familiar figure hovered over to Sigzil, giving a salute. “Hey, hooch,”\nLopen said. “Sounds like you’ve been having a hard time of it.”\nSigzil nodded. “You heard …?”\n“About Leyten. Yeah.” Lopen led the group of Windrunners who had\ntaken the Mink to Herdaz. They were finally back, adding another twenty\nRadiants to Sigzil’s army. They helped chase the Skybreakers away, and the\nfight quieted for a while, the last Magnified One dying on the wall.\nShe had left tens of Sigzil’s soldiers dead and broken. One Stoneward\nkilled. And those stones kept hitting the wall, crash after crash.\n“You brought Stormlight?” Sigzil asked.\n“Not much,” Lopen said. “Hooch … we nearly ran ourselves out flying"

        "text": "The fool will, when losing, seek to flip the board and scatter the\npieces. This is not an adage for towers.\n—Proverbs for Towers and War, Zenaz, date unknown\nNavani paused outside her office in the Kholinar palace, listening. The\nentire building seemed to vibrate with shouts and clashing men. How\nfamiliar those sounds were to her. A scholar in name, and at heart, but her\nlife had never been one of quiet study. Her life had been a battlefield.\nShe felt drawn toward the sounds, magnetically, as she walked the empty\nhallways; all soldiers had been pulled into the clash. Aesudan’s loyalists—\ncorrupted by the touch of an Unmade, having locked away any soldiers who\ndisagreed—were fighting both Elhokar’s incursion force and invading\nsingers. Adolin described it as a confusing storm of killing. Yet that was\nbelow. Here, on an upper floor, she was able to walk alone.\nAt the hallway she knew they would come down, she turned and\nwatched. I’m early, she thought, remembering Adolin’s narrative. That\nfighting she heard was Adolin and Elhokar battering their way through the\ndefenders at the front of the palace. She had time. Should she go for Gav\nalone?\nNo. Though it was difficult, she forced herself to analyze the situation.\nAdolin had said the queen was guarded by a force of soldiers. These\nhallways were empty, but Aesudan’s chambers would not be—and Navani\nwould have a very difficult time there, even with some power over the\nvisions.\nMoreover, what good would it do to rescue Gav, then hopefully Dalinar,\nif the three of them were still trapped in these visions? She needed to devise\na path out of the Spiritual Realm entirely. She reached out for the Sibling,\nbut found her mind abuzz with … with tones, vibrations, music that\ndisharmonized.\nBut Navani … she knew the right tones, didn’t she? She thought back to\nher time with Raboniel, and sorted through the noise. With her eyes closed,\nshe found them. The tones. The sounds of Roshar itself.\nNavani? The Sibling’s voice.\nYes.\nYou are lost among infinite possibilities.\nI can hear them, I think, Navani said. Tones that vibrate the wrong way,\nlike an instrument out of tune.\nThose are the possible futures, the Sibling said. Discordant until they\nbecome reality, and then snap, they match the tones of Roshar. I’m sorry. I\ncannot see you. I …\nIs there time left? Navani asked, feeling desperate. Until the deadline?\nLess than a day.\nTime. She wasn’t too late.\nI need a way out, Navani sent. I’ve attempted to make a perpendicularity\nin here. Nothing happens.\nYou can’t make one that leads out in the same way, the Sibling said. It’s\nlike you’ve slid down a tall mountain slope, and are now at the base, trying\nto get back up.\nWit gets out, Navani sent. Others get out. How?\nUsing points of transition, the Sibling said, their voice growing distant. If\nsomeone else made a hole in, you could escape that way. I could … I could\ntry to help …"

        "text": "Using points of transition, the Sibling said, their voice growing distant. If\nsomeone else made a hole in, you could escape that way. I could … I could\ntry to help …\nNavani lost the tones in the cacophony. Points of transition, she thought.\nCan I trick the vision into giving me one of those?\nShe heard soldiers approaching, so she stepped back as a collection of\nAesudan’s troops—having left her private chambers—passed and gathered\nat the top of the stairs. It was time. She turned, steeling herself, and watched\nthe stairwell.\nAnd there he was, with brilliant Shardblade aloft. Elhokar, her son.\nKaladin guarded his side, and some fifty soldiers followed, loyal to the\nking. Part of the force Elhokar had recruited to break in and save his family\n—the son who needed him desperately, and the wife who would refuse his\naid.\nNavani’s heart twisted to see his face again. She blinked away tears, and\nfound … a certain peace as he announced himself to the gathered defenders\n—his proud voice making them break and retreat past Navani, ignoring her.\nElhokar hadn’t been a particularly good king. And he … he could have been\na better person. Maybe that last part was her fault, though she hadn’t had\nmuch parenting help—not the useful kind.\nThose worries fled as she saw Elhokar appearing to glow with his own\npower. In the end, her son had been a hero. A king. His death hurt, but she\ndidn’t feel the extreme pain she’d expected at encountering him here. In\nsome ways it was actually comforting. For this was Elhokar Kholin at his\nfinest, perhaps the brightest moment of his life, leading with confidence.\nRescuing his son. Standing shoulder to shoulder with a Radiant.\nAs the defenders retreated, Navani emerged from her alcove. Kaladin\nand Elhokar saw her, and stopped.\n“M-Mother?” Elhokar said.\nSo, he saw her as herself. She hadn’t been certain. “Come quickly,” she\nsaid. “Aesudan has left your son to the torments of spren.”\n“How are you here?” Elhokar asked, stepping up. “Mother. It seems\nimpossible.”\n“Dalinar learned to make a portal for me,” she said. “It’s fine. It makes\nsense. Let this play out as it should.”\nElhokar … nodded. He took her face in his hands, as if uncertain she was\nreal, then embraced her. Kaladin, standing behind, waved them forward and\ntogether they marched on Aesudan’s chambers, passing statues of Heralds\nand the corridor where the soldiers had retreated—leaving the queen. Who\ncould be heard singing in the room beyond.\nElhokar halted in place, cocked his head, then looked at Navani.\nSomething in his demeanor had changed.\n“What is it?” Navani asked.\n“Just … impressed with you, Mother,” he said, and led the way into the\nroom.\nShe didn’t have time for the conversation that took place with Aesudan\n—it wasn’t real anyway. Now that she was here, Navani pushed through the\ncluttered room and found Gav at the rear, behind a dressing screen. And"

        "text": "—it wasn’t real anyway. Now that she was here, Navani pushed through the\ncluttered room and found Gav at the rear, behind a dressing screen. And\nblessedly, it was the real him. The older Gav—a year made a big difference\nwhen one was small—with tearstained eyes. Navani seized him, pulling\nhim close, ignoring the spren that darted away.\n“Gram?” he said. He held her tightly. “Gram, is that you? The real you?”\n“Yes, dear one.”\n“Where is Grampa?” Gavinor whispered, clinging to her. “Why … why\nis he so busy killing people? Why is he so terrible? Why does he hate me,\nand everyone, so much?”\n“That wasn’t him you saw,” Navani guessed. “It was a terrible vision,\nGav. Dalinar loves you.”\n“Daddy said …” Gav whispered. “Daddy said I should try to be strong,\nlike him …”\nHe calmed, and his soul vibrated against hers. This was him, and not\nsome fabrication of the visions. She soothed him, drying his tears, before\nprocessing what he’d said.\nHe’d been hearing his father all through these visions. Navani looked\nback toward Elhokar—who had left the conversation with Aesudan and\nstood alone in the center of the room, staring toward her, a hint of a smile\non his lips. His face in shadow. He’d changed in an eyeblink.\nWhatever that was, it wasn’t her son. Not even a simulacrum of him\ncreated in vision, as it had been moments before. This was something else\nin his skin.\n“What now?” not-Elhokar asked. “You have Gavinor.”\n“We get out,” she whispered, pulling Gav close.\n“Oh, but how?” not-Elhokar said. “Isn’t that the problem you’ve had all\nalong, Navani?”\n“Gram,” Gav said, pointing. “It’s him. Daddy. He’s been helping me.”\nNavani held him, trembling, and backed away from the thing. What lived\nin this place of shadows and half realities? She ran into the wall as the thing\nadvanced.\n“Oh, Navani,” it said, and the voice … sounded familiar to her. Not\nElhokar’s, but someone else’s. “I’m so glad I was able to spend more time\nwith you here, seeing what makes you afraid, and what makes you angry.”\n“Odium,” she whispered.\n“And more,” he replied. “You haven’t answered me. You found Gav,\nthrough your cleverness. I should have expected you’d work out how to\nmanipulate this place. But what now?”\n“Now,” she whispered, “I am worried I’ll see him being tormented.\nDalinar, the man I love. I am afraid you’ll make me watch him in pain.”\n“Ah …” Odium said, still bearing Elhokar’s face—but making\nexpressions she’d never seen on her son. As if his flesh were a mask\ndistorted by something behind. “So that’s how you made it here. Clever\nindeed. I should have watched you more closely.”\nShe thought about Dalinar in need and tried to Connect to him—or trick\nthe vision into taking her there. But Odium waved his hand, and the vision"

        "text": "indeed. I should have watched you more closely.”\nShe thought about Dalinar in need and tried to Connect to him—or trick\nthe vision into taking her there. But Odium waved his hand, and the vision\nremained solid. Here, he was completely in control. Her will was a candle’s\nflame compared to the bonfire that was the will of a god.\nNow what?\nHolding to Gav, she made a decision. A desperate, painful decision. She\ncouldn’t help Dalinar in here, but if she got out, she might be able to find a\nway to use her powers—or the Stormfather’s—to reach him.\nShe had Gav. She needed to take him and go, hopefully while the enemy\nunderestimated her.\n“We must continue this vision,” Navani whispered.\n“Why?” Odium asked. “You’re that eager to see your son die, Navani?\nSuch passion that will inspire!”\nShe hurried past him, joining Kaladin and the soldiers as they rushed\nback down the hallway. Odium trailed behind in Elhokar’s form, playing\nout the vision. Navani kept Gav safe, whispering for him not to watch, as\nthey reached the ground floor—and the mess really started. The singer\nattack had breached the palace.\nShe found—as she pushed through the chaos of the battle—that she\ndidn’t need to watch the next part. Why look backward? She couldn’t save\nElhokar. But she could save Gav. She deliberately chose to remember her\nson as he’d been, bursting to the top of that stairwell. Before Odium had\nturned his attention on this vision and taken his place.\n“Gram,” Gav whispered, his eyes squeezed shut, “I’m scared.”\n“It’s all right, gemheart,” she whispered, barreling toward the Sunwalk\nwith some soldiers. “I have you.” This long covered walkway led to a built-\nup location beside the palace.\nKholinar’s Oathgate.\n“Navani?” Elhokar’s voice called after her. “Mother? Mother, help me!”\nHer blood turned cold as she heard Odium shifting his tone to mimic\nElhokar’s. Pleading for help amid the screaming and fighting soldiers.\nLife before death.\nGav was alive.\nBehind her was only death.\nShe reached the Oathgate. Below, she knew the city was flooding with\nsingers.\nThis city was lost long ago. This is a vision.\n“Activate it,” she hissed at the simulacrum of Kaladin beside her. He\nhadn’t frozen in battle this time, as he’d followed her instead of staying to\nfight.\n“But …”\n“Do it!” she snapped.\n“Mother?” Elhokar’s voice.\n“Elhokar’s coming,” Kaladin said. “Navani, he’s limping across the\nSunwalk. He’s wounded!”\n“Activate the Oathgate,” she said.\n“But …”\n“You aren’t real,” she whispered to Kaladin, refusing to turn toward\nElhokar. “He isn’t real. But we are. Please. Help us. If there is anything of\nthe real Stormblessed inside of you, summon it. Please.”\nThe simulacrum looked to her, and something did seem to steel inside\nhim. He ran for the Oathgate’s control building."

        "text": "the real Stormblessed inside of you, summon it. Please.”\nThe simulacrum looked to her, and something did seem to steel inside\nhim. He ran for the Oathgate’s control building.\nWhile Elhokar’s pained voice whispered behind her, “Ah … that might\nwork for you, Navani. An Oathgate activation, even in a vision, will be a\nrush of power. But will you abandon Dalinar as you did Elhokar? The man\nyou love? He is real. And I have him.”\n“Dalinar,” she whispered, “is strong enough to fight you. I trust him.”\nThe Oathgate flashed. In that moment, she sought the tones of Roshar\nagain, and she felt something latch onto her.\nI have you, the Sibling said. Connect to me.\nShe held on. Tight. She’d always been good at holding to things she\nloved. Only recently had she begun to acknowledge when she needed to let\ngo.\nGav in one arm, she pulled with her might and—more importantly—her\nmind.\nAnd emerged from light into her rooms at Urithiru.\nVenli—shrouded in a cloak, hunched down to hide her envoyform height—\nwalked through the human camp, accompanied by several armed human\nguards.\nNarak had changed much in the year or so since she’d lived here. Gone\nwere the ramshackle listener buildings, replaced by stone bunkers. A large\nstone wall protected it, a fortification of amazing strength, standing even\nagainst the boulders thrown by the metacha-im, the Focused Ones.\nIt was cracked though, and she could hear the stone pleading as it began\nto fail. She passed the dead lying in rows, among solemn rainspren and\nblood flowing like water. Beleaguered soldiers carried wounded to the\nOathgate, for transfer to Urithiru—and the healers there.\nMost telling, she passed someone in a Radiant uniform, weeping and\nshivering, her stare hollow as she whispered about a distinctly new pain.\nRlain had told her the truth: spren could be killed. A new era had come\nupon them.\nStill under guard, she stepped into a building at the center of the plateau.\nA well-lit room inside held tables, battle maps, and an Azish man in a\nWindrunner uniform. He looked up, studying her as she entered.\n“The singer Radiant,” he said to her in Alethi. “I don’t think I’d have\nbelieved it, despite what I’ve heard, if you hadn’t emerged from the rock\nnear one of my patrols.”\nShe’d noticed that Odium’s forces didn’t know what she could do. Her\npeople had been given cloaks as blankets to sleep under. Hopefully the\nenemy guards would not find the lump of shaped stone under a cloak, the\nreal Venli having slipped down into the stones to escape. It was more than\nshe’d ever done with the power before. She was improving.\n“Welcome,” the Windrunner said, exhaustionspren buzzing around him.\n“I’m glad for your offer, but I don’t think you’ll be able to help in the way\nyou want.”\n“You’re right,” she said, frank. “The enemy will wipe you off this\nplateau within hours, and we haven’t enough troops to help you.

But your\nmessage said you have a different proposal?”\nHe outlined one, and it wouldn’t work either. She knew that instantly.\nBut what if …\nWhat if she took some of his idea … and added some of hers?\n“Where is Jasnah?” Venli asked. “The human queen of Alethkar,\ndaughter of the man we slew so many years ago?”\n“At Thaylen City,” he said, frowning. “Why?”\n“I think your idea will work, with some revisions. But it will need to\ninvolve her …”\nNINE YEARS AGO\nSzeth, the last bearer of Truth, killed.\nHe soared across the battlefield, dressed in bright colors: red and orange\nand all shades between. He came in low, booted feet brushing the grass,\nsword out to the side, passing an entire line of soldiers. Twenty of them died\nbefore they could react, and the block of soldiers shattered.\nHe hovered briefly, watching his troops move in, displeased. His soldiers\nwere sloppy, timid. Killing a human being was an entirely different\nexperience from stabbing a pig carcass, and years of abstract training could\nnot replace actual experience in battle. They would have to do better. The\nVoidbringers would put up a much more resilient defense than this city\nmilitia.\nHe gave his soldiers just long enough to start to flounder, his long red\nbelt fluttering in the wind, sword out to the side. He had, unfortunately, very\nlittle experience training soldiers—merely a short stint as an officer during\nwhich he’d sunk those raiders’ ships. Looking back, he could see how lucky\nhe’d been to inherit soldiers who were battle-hardened against the\nstonewalkers.\nAs his line stalled—a few of them staring, disbelieving, at the deaths\nthey’d caused—he lowered, then infused one of the holy boulders outside\nthis town and sent it crashing among the enemy ranks. The remnants went\nfleeing back to their town, throwing down their weapons.\nSo it began. Their first battle. It hadn’t happened with a triumphant\nmarch of glorious armies, but with a few hundred acolytes who were killing\nfor the first time.\n“You will have to do better,” he snapped at his troops, and saw them\ndeflate, sag. Well, good. They had been embarrassing, and he’d needed to\ndo all the work. “Come. We must secure the town and begin persuading\nthem to join our cause.”\nEveryone in the town paid him lip service now that he’d conquered them.\nThey would bow to him as he walked past, call him honor-nimi. Board his\nsoldiers, and let him recruit.\nHe didn’t have their hearts. He felt it as he spoke with the town butcher\nto secure supplies for his men. The spindly man bowed, but he was afraid.\nHe was not liberated. And he refused to be liberated, no matter what Szeth\nsaid.\n“I promise you,” Szeth told him, “the Return has begun. The\nVoidbringers attack our land.”\n“Yes, of course, honor-nimi.” The butcher bowed again.\n“You don’t believe,” Szeth said, then glanced at his officers. “He doesn’t\nbelieve.”"

You must see and understand that. Why don’t you see?”\nThe man seemed uncomfortable. He offered more of his best cuts of\nmeat. Szeth sighed, accepted the offer, then moved on through the town.\nHis officers caught up. “It’s going to be like this everywhere we go,”\nVisk warned. “It’s why Tuko never actually decided to rebel. He knew—\none Honorbearer against the others—it was going to look like a power\nstruggle, a civil war.”\nSzeth stopped at the end of the boardwalk and gazed out across the green\nspring grass, the fields newly planted, beneath a sky that at times appeared\ntoo pure a blue to be real. As if they were watercolors on a giant canvas.\nHe’d imagined thousands flocking to him. The banner of Truth raised\nhigh, a grand army forming to help him root out the sickness upon the land.\nInstead, the people wanted to ignore him. Hoping he, like a strange stench,\nwould simply … go away.\nSzeth dismissed his officers. One small town, and already administration\nwas a headache. Thinking of that made him wonder about his father, held\nby the enemy—Sivi and Pozen’s conversation had confirmed that.\nEventually the enemy would play that piece, demanding that Szeth turn\nhimself in or Neturo would be executed.\nWhat would he do when that day came? It was a situation where …\nwhere the right choice was exceptionally difficult. And how was Szeth\ngoing to conquer an entire nation? How would he lead them against the\nVoidbringers’ invading force, which—as soon as they realized what he was\ndoing—would be sure to come out of hiding and strike.\n“How,” he whispered, still standing at the edge of the boardwalk. “How\ndo I do this? Please.”\nThe Honorbearers are weak, the Voice said. They hide, hoping you will\nlose your nerve.\n“You,” Szeth hissed. “I thought I was done with you.”\nOh, Szeth. You’ll never be done with me.\n“Out!” Szeth shouted. “Out of my head!”\nThe Voice chuckled. You’ve committed a cardinal sin. You’ve killed\nothers of your kind, raised a rebellion, however small. The fight you’ve\nwanted is building. You just need to push it over the tipping point, and draw\nout the other Honorbearers so you can kill them.\nSzeth forced himself to be calm. At least the Voice was familiar. He\nknew where he stood with it. And, perhaps in its decision to taunt him, it\nhad given something away. So long as he contained his revolution to this\nsmall region, the others would rightly assume they could ignore him. What"

We march.”\n“What?” she asked. “Where?”\n“Along the mountains,” Szeth said. “Toward my home village—and the\nStoneward monastery. Where a real army has been training for decades\nagainst raiders from outside.”\nAn army that had been organized, disciplined, and administered by a\ngenius: Szeth’s father. They would listen to Szeth. Among them were\nsoldiers who respected him for his strength of leadership.\nLet the Honorbearers ignore him once those troops were beneath his\nbanner.\nSEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO\nI, G , .\nOD HELD THE BODY OF A DEAD CHILD AND WEPT AS THE SKY BURNED\nA .

But beware the assumption that you have considered\nevery possibility.\n—Proverbs for Towers and War, Zenaz, date unknown\nAs Szeth led Kaladin to the Skybreaker monastery, the land grew\nexceptionally hilly. Brown rolling hills, covered in scrub grasses that\nhugged the ground. More weed than true grass, the plants had petals that\nspread out rather than grew upward. Szeth had never learned their names.\nKaladin found the grass fascinating. He still had a childlike wonder\nwhen investigating common, normal plants. Szeth might have gotten tired\nof that attitude, had it not grown into a certain respect and admiration.\nKaladin actually appeared to like this place. After years in the East, Szeth\nwould not have expected that from one of them.\n“This grass is like half something of your world,” Kaladin explained at\nSzeth’s questioning glance, “and half something of mine. It doesn’t move\nwhen touched, but it looks like it’s hiding on the ground, trying to get out of\nthe wind.”\nThis terrain was a borderland between their worlds. They crossed large\nsections of stone where the soil had washed away, and the road wound\naround those parts. Szeth didn’t bother to do likewise. Not anymore.\nEventually they halted atop a particularly tall hill, facing eastward. In\nthese highlands, with their chill air even this far north, it didn’t feel like\nmuch separated them from stonewalker lands. The barrier here seemed\nmore philosophical than physical.\nSylphrena came flying down to check on them. “You two all right?” she\nasked, remaining as a ribbon of light.\n“Just wondering what’s happening to Dalinar and the others,” Kaladin\nsaid. “No reply from the spanreed last night. I wonder if we’re too\nunimportant to answer. Do you feel anything, Syl?”\n“I feel a trembling in the wind,” she said, her voice growing smaller.\n“The world is holding its breath.”\nKaladin glanced to Szeth, who shrugged. He would have liked to be with\nDalinar, but it was not his task. So he started down the hill. “I have\ndecided,” he told Kaladin as the man caught up, “that I need to fight and kill\ndespite my preferences. The duty I bear is too great.”\nHe glanced to Kaladin after he said it, ashamed.\nThe Windrunner merely nodded. “I’m sorry, Szeth. What can I do to\nhelp?”\n“I cannot be persuaded.”\n“I gathered that from the tone of your voice. Can I help?”\nSzeth continued more carefully—waiting for the objections. “If I am to\nbe a Herald, I will need to fight. That is that.”\nKaladin nodded, looking thoughtful as he hiked.

Today, they had split\nthe swords between them. Szeth wore Nightblood and a few Honorblades\non his back, while Kaladin had tied several to the large rucksack he wore.\n“I hear you,” Kaladin said. “I’ve had that same problem. Still rips me up\ninside, to think of the men—and singers—I’ve killed. At first, it helped me\nto divide everyone into us and them, then focus only on protecting the us.\nThe longer I was in the military though, the more that shifted.”\n“How?” Szeth asked, genuinely curious.\nKaladin’s expression grew distant. “I started to realize, Szeth, there can\nalways be more them. When I started fighting? It wasn’t against Parshendi;\nit was my own people. Not even from another kingdom, merely other Alethi.\nWe’ll always find someone to fight, if we look. I’ve fought against one of\nmy own brothers, the man who took your sword. I realized I couldn’t\nsimply kill whenever I was told. Neither could I walk away, or people I\nloved would die.”\n“So … what did you do?” Szeth asked. “It sounds like there’s no\nanswer.”\n“No explicit one,” Kaladin said. “I do know someone, Zahel, who just\nwalked away. I respect that. But I had to draw lines I wouldn’t cross.” He\ntook a deep breath, as if admitting this next part was difficult. “Then I had\nto step up and take responsibility. Become one of the people who made\ndecisions. If I wanted the killing to stop, I had to make it stop. From the top,\nas a leader.” He cocked his head. “I guess … I guess that means I really\nshould be a lighteyes, doesn’t it? Maybe that was why Dalinar was offering\n…”\nSzeth slowed on the path, considering. Then he stopped. “Kaladin?”\nThe other man hesitated, looking back.\n“Tell me what to do,” Szeth said. “When we reach the next monastery.\nShould I fight, or should I refuse?”\nKaladin smiled, then shook his head and continued on.\nSzeth ran to catch up, awkwardly holding the bundle of swords on his\nback, kicking up dust. “I will do as you say.”\n“Not going to happen, Szeth.”\n“You came to help me! Dalinar commanded you.”\n“I’m helping as best I can,” Kaladin said. “What do you feel you should\ndo?”\n“I feel I need to fight,” Szeth said. “I have to kill. Someone needs to do\nit.”\n“Then I’ll support you. Help you work through the pain.”\n“But you want me to make the other choice,” Szeth said. “Say it.”\n“I want you to choose. What I’d choose isn’t relevant, Szeth. I’m not\nhere to make you do anything specific. I’m here to try to help you be\nhealthy in making your choice.”\nAnd … he seemed honest. Legitimately honest.

        "text": "healthy in making your choice.”\nAnd … he seemed honest. Legitimately honest. How long had it been\nsince someone in Szeth’s life had … refused to give him orders? The only\ntime he could remember was long ago, when he’d spoken to the Farmer in\nhis childhood.\nKaladin was a killer, one of the best Szeth knew. But somehow he\nexpressed the same wisdom as the most peaceful man Szeth had ever met. It\nwas a revelation. Like a burst of gloryspren, though he did not draw any in\nthis place. Kaladin had actually found a path to peace. It was possible.\nSzeth could choose to find peace himself. And perhaps, maybe, with\nwork, he could be well again.\nSuddenly, everything looked different. Windswept hills weren’t just\ndusty and brown, they were home, welcoming Szeth back after his long,\nexhausting trials. A blue sky that had watched him dance wanted to see joy\nonce more. Life wasn’t a thing of beauty for him, and the shadows hadn’t\nvanished, but someone had found a way out. The road was no longer a path\ntoward doom or death. It was a way forward.\nStrange, how much could change because of a conversation.\nSzeth’s first instinct was still to try to swear some oath to Kaladin, this\nman who had shown him so much. But that was wrong. That wasn’t the\npoint.\nDon’t expect to heal quickly, he thought, recalling one of the things\nKaladin had said to him early on. Szeth was surprised he remembered. He\nhad been listening more than he assumed. It’s a long road.\nWell, Szeth was accustomed to long roads.\n“Is that it?” Kaladin asked, pointing up the way to some structures on a\nridge.\n“That is it.”\n“Feels … wrong,” Kaladin said, frowning. They shared a look, and Szeth\nnodded. Yes, it did.\nThey were in the air a moment later to get a better view. Syl joined them\nin ribbon form, and the problems became evident: fallen roofs, the walls\nstanding alone, the broken doors.\nThis town had been attacked. Without waiting for Kaladin, Szeth\nincreased his Lashing, wind rushing around him. The town here was\nclustered among hills in a dusty, out-of-the-way section of the highlands.\nNothing but brown wilderness extended for miles outside the town’s walls.\n“This happened a while ago,” Kaladin said as they slowed above the\nmonastery. “A couple of the buildings are burned, but there’s no scent of\nsmoke.”\n“Agreed,” Szeth said. This place had been raided, then abandoned. No,\nhe thought, noticing some movement in the shadows of rubble. Mostly\nabandoned.\n“You see that?” Kaladin asked, pointing at some other shadows. “The\npeople are here, as in the other towns. The darkness covers this place.”\n“I had hoped it would be different,” Szeth said.\n“Why?” Syl asked, forming her full-sized human shape.\n“Because we know this Honorbearer,” Szeth said, leading the way down\ntoward the monastery in the center of town—the largest structure, perched\non one of the higher hills.\nThey landed before the monastery, which had a broken-in roof, but all"

The great wooden gates were ajar, and Syl peeked in\nfirst, then nodded to the other two. The doors were heavy enough that they\nhad to slip in between them, leaving them mostly shut.\nInside, a figure in a black uniform stood at the far end of the grand\nentryway. Facing them. Hands on the crossguard of his Shardblade, which\nwas planted point-first into the stone floor. Nin-son-God looked unchanged\nfrom when he’d left them last night.\nSzeth took off his swords and handed them to Kaladin.\nSzeth? Nightblood asked. I think you should use me for this fight. I’m a\nreally good sword.\n“I know, sword-nimi,” Szeth whispered. “I fear this is not the test for\nyou.”\nBut—\n“Please let me choose,” Szeth said.\nOh. Oh, RIGHT. Got it.\nSzeth nodded to Kaladin, then summoned his Blade. He turned and\nstrode farther into the room, stepping into sunlight streaming through the\nbroken roof. He walked over and around the rubble of its fall, and some\nboulders from a collapsed chimney.\n“Sir?” he asked Nin. “What happened here?”\n“There are those,” the Herald said, “who seek to prevent what is coming.\nWhat you will become.”\nSzeth stopped a safe distance away. “Is this challenge like the others?”\nhe asked, right palm sweaty as he carried his Blade. Could he … fight a\nHerald?\n“No,” Nin said, bringing him relief. “You would not survive a fight\nagainst me, so it would be unfair. Thus, in this challenge, I simply\ncommand you to accept your place. The next monastery is the last, where\nyou will be tested to your fullest. I demand your word that you will obey\nme, and do exactly as I tell you, once we reach it.”\nIt was a simple test. The easiest for Szeth. For he always did as his\nmasters required.\n“Now,” Nin said, “give me your oath.”\nSzeth opened his mouth. And an oddity slipped out.\n“No.”\nSilence. Even the whispers quieted, shocked.\n“Szeth,” Nin said, “I require this.”\n“Tell me what you will make me do,” Szeth found himself saying. “I\ncannot judge if I do not know the cost.”\nNin floated forward, his coat trembling in the breeze. “You never needed\nthis before.”\nSzeth did not speak. He had said what he wanted.\nNin halted maybe five feet away. Within Shardblade striking distance.\n“Promise me you will follow my commands,” he said softly. “Give me an\noath. This is your test, Szeth.”\nThe room felt colder. Szeth breathed out, and swore he saw it puff.\n“What is happening to this land, Nin? Why are the people consumed by\ndarkness? Who is the Unmade that I fight? What is going on?”\n“You don’t need to know that yet. Speak the words.”\nSzeth met his eyes, and said them. “I,” he whispered, “am not a thing.”\nNin let the slightest sigh of annoyance pass his lips. It was the strongest"

It was the strongest\nsign of emotion Szeth had seen from him.\n“I,” Szeth repeated, “am not a thing, Nin. I’m not a rock to be handed\nbetween people, exchanged like money. I’m a person. You ask me to be a\nHerald. A Herald! A demigod, an immortal leader of humankind. Yet you\nwant me to do as I’m told?”\n“You always have before,” Nin said.\n“I was broken before!” Szeth shrieked. “I was ripped away from my\nperfect life and pounded and forged and beaten into a weapon! I can’t be\nwhat you want! At least not unless I know what it will cost me. I get to\nchoose. I … I deserve to be able to decide. If I can’t have the life I want, I at\nleast deserve to choose what I’m walking toward instead!”\nHe looked to Nin, pleading, wishing for him to understand. Szeth just\nneeded this small measure of comfort. He’d do it. He’d take up the mantle,\nhe’d give away everything he’d started to dream he could have. He’d do it.\nBut he had to make the choice. It was a luxury that he’d never before\nwanted, but that now—suddenly—he absolutely needed.\n“So be it,” Nin said, raising his sword in one hand. “We will do this the\nmore difficult way. I do not think it is possible, but you will have to defeat\nme as you did the others. If you kill me, I will be reborn, as our immortality\nwas sealed through ancient arts related to—but not dependent upon—the\nOathpact. Unfortunately, I am very likely to kill you instead.”\nHe stepped down onto the ground, leaving the air to give himself\npurchase and leverage for a lunge, then swung.\nSzeth dropped his Shardblade, determined not to fight.\nIt was the wrong choice.\nHe knew that in an instant. His sister had refused to kill him, but Nin\nwould not hold back.\nSo Szeth saw his death approach as a silver wave of light. Until a spear\nintercepted it with a resounding clang.\nKaladin stepped up beside Szeth, tossing off Nale’s attack.\n“You cannot interfere, Stormblessed,” Nale said, calm, pulling backward\ninto the air.\nThis man, Kaladin thought. This storming man. “For a person who harps\non about the law so often,” Kaladin snapped, “I find it shocking that you\nforget there are no rules.”\n“It should be a struggle between me and him,” Nale said.\n“Szeth,” Kaladin said, not daring to take his eyes off Nale, “do you want\nmy help?”\n“Yes, please,” Szeth whispered. “Nin, this is my champion. I cannot\nfight you. I choose not to. But he defeated me. He can defeat you.”\nNale raised his sword in a formal posture. He blinked once, then turned\nto Kaladin. “I see. This is the way forward. Once you are dead, Szeth will\nbe free of your influence.”\n“Nale,” Kaladin said. “Don’t force this. Let’s talk about—”"

Let’s talk about—”\n“I will be your death, Stormblessed,” Nale said. “If you are certain you\naccept this charge and duty.”\nGreat. Your thoughts? he asked Syl in his mind.\nI think this is the only way, she replied. But Kaladin … Heralds are\nsupposed to be virtually undefeatable.\nIf that were the case, he thought, they wouldn’t have died during each of\nthe Desolations. They still need Stormlight, right? They’re experts in the\nSurges. So maybe …\n“Your word, Stormblessed?” Nale asked.\n“You’d accept such an unfair fight?” Kaladin asked, treading carefully,\nhis armor spren humming in his mind, currently invisible—as they usually\nwere when not dancing with the wind—but ready to manifest. “I’m willing,\nbut I want to be sure.”\n“If you do not face me, I will kill Szeth,” Nale said. “So this is fairer\nthan slaying him as he stands there.”\n“And if we could make it even more fair?” Kaladin said, untying the\npouch of spheres at his belt. “I’d go without Stormlight. What about you?\nJust the skill of one soldier against another.”\n“I am blessed with millennia of training. It would not be fair even still.”\n“But more fair?” Kaladin pressed.\nNale contemplated, then fished a pouch from his pocket.\nWhat do you think? Kaladin asked Syl.\nI think … this might be better, she said. You’re more recently practiced\nwithout powers. He might be rusty. But do you really want to fight? Isn’t\nthere another way to reach him?\nLogic won’t work, Kaladin thought to her. If he were reasonable, we\nwouldn’t be here. So maybe this is the only way to force him to change.\nAnother voice … “Take care,” the Wind whispered. “Honor is dead, and\nJezrien is gone. Nale … can command forces once forbidden him … But\nthis is your best chance …”\n“Fine,” Nale said, tossing first one pouch to Szeth, then a second, then\nfinally a third. “Sword against spear.”\n“Fine,” Kaladin said, tossing his gemstones to Szeth as well. “I accept\nyour challenge, Nale. I will protect the one who cannot right now protect\nhimself.”\n“Windrunners,” Nale said, as if it were a curse. “Still, I commend you\nfor your sacrifice.” The man dropped fully to the rubble, boots scraping\nstone and broken bits of wood, then exhaled until his Stormlight was gone.\nKaladin infused a rock with all of his own Stormlight and sent it sailing\noff at an angle into the sky. Szeth, holding their pouches of spheres, backed\nup toward the wall—where Kaladin had dropped his pack and the\nHonorblades.\n“I have heard of your skill with the weapon, Stormblessed,” Nale said,\nswinging with his Blade experimentally as he stretched. “I shall enjoy\nseeing what you can do. I warn you, this is to the death. Your armor is\nallowed, as are our Blades and talents unrelated to Stormlight. We go on\nyour mark.”"

We go on\nyour mark.”\nKaladin stepped back, raised his spear into position, and gave a mental\ncommand to his armor to make sure it was in place.\n“Go,” he said.\nAfter dealing with an interesting matter involving the battle at the Shattered\nPlains, Jasnah met Fen at the designated time in the small temple Dalinar\nhad repaired. Fen arrived with apparent curiosity, while Jasnah …\nJasnah was drawing exhaustionspren.\nShe’d wasted time, exactly as Odium had predicted, mulling over the\nnature of the upcoming debate. She’d compared notes with Fen, who had\nalso been visited by Odium and been told the same thing: to meet at the\ntemple for a debate about whether or not Thaylenah should join his empire.\nJasnah had held herself back—with general success—from diving into\nthe historical record to search for examples of one of the three gods\nappearing directly to individuals. Instead she’d gone straight to Wit.\nHis words, via spanreed, had persuaded her. Taravangian taking up\nOdium explained, in Wit’s mind, the deity’s odd behavior. Rayse always did\nassume he was invincible, Wit had written, even before his Ascension. But\nall along, the power has been seeking someone more aligned to its interests.\nTaravangian’s Ascension is the answer to the question I was seeking. And\ngood riddance to a terrible person who deserved far worse than he got. I\nhope it was painful.\nThat said, I do not know if this is good for us. Rayse was crafty,\ndangerous, and destructive—but he was easy to anticipate and goad into\naction. Taravangian … I do not know him well enough. Take care. He will\nno longer be the man you knew, but a being of immense power. Not truly\nGod, a point upon which you and I agree, but the closest the cosmere\nknows.\nShe’d prepared as best she could, all night. Now Jasnah settled down at\nher table, laying out her books and scribbled notes. Fen paced, wearing\nThaylen clothing: a vest and blouse above an ankle-length skirt with straps\nup over the shoulders.\n“You really think he’s going to come?” Fen said. “This isn’t some\ndistraction?”\n“Taravangian is a philosopher. He will welcome the chance to prove\nhimself in a debate.”\n“Taravangian,” Fen said, pacing back the other way. “I don’t believe it’s\nhim. This is a game. Though I’m intrigued. I’ll admit, even with all of our\npreparations, I was worried about losing the city to his army. But our battle\nis merely a conversation … If he realized he couldn’t conquer us, and is\ninstead trying something more desperate … this could stall us until the\ndeadline.”\nJasnah didn’t contradict her, though she was far less certain. Her gut said\nthat an army would be easier to deal with than the concentrated attention of\na Shard of Adonalsium. She looked over her notes again, readying her\narguments.\nFen found that amusing as well. She insisted she wasn’t going to give in"

She insisted she wasn’t going to give in\nto Odium as Tashikk and Emul had, so why did Jasnah bother? But\nTaravangian was subtle, careful, and highly capable. He obviously thought\nthis would work. To that end, Jasnah had rehearsed appeals to the Thaylen\nsense of pride and independence. Arguments against the morality of the\nsinger empire. Specific criticisms of Odium’s historical methods of rule,\nwhich she had records to prove.\nHaving done all of that, having spent so many hours planning in a flurry,\nshe suddenly felt foolish. It was all so obvious. Of course the Thaylens\nwouldn’t choose to follow the enemy. They had worried, throughout the\nfounding of the coalition, that Jasnah’s uncle would dominate them. They\nwere quite capable of rejecting Odium doing the same.\nWhy, then, was she so anxious?\nThe entrance to the small room darkened. Guards who had been waiting\noutside rushed in to surround Fen, one of them even charging through the\nblack smoke itself. He stopped in front of the queen and put the point of his\nsword toward the forming Shard. Jasnah took a mental note to ask his name\nlater; he might be Radiant material.\nThe darkness coalesced into a kindly old man, standing straight-backed,\nbut with a golden walking stick. He had on orange and gold robes that\nweren’t nearly as gaudy as the attire his predecessor had reportedly worn.\nAs in life, Taravangian had a wispy beard, pointed at the front, white and\nshort along his jaw. He hadn’t fixed his balding forehead.\nHe didn’t seem to mind looking small and unassuming. “It’s good to see\nyou both again,” he said. “Thank you for taking my suggestions seriously.\nFen, you will not need those guards.”\nShe eyed him, mostly obscured by hulking soldiers, then quietly asked\nfor them to step outside. They went reluctantly. Jasnah’s tension rose as\nTaravangian sat down, a stool forming behind him from dark smoke.\nHe waved in front of him. “Shall we chat here, as former friends?” Two\nmore stools formed.\n“I don’t see the need, Odium,” Fen said, folding her arms, remaining\nstanding. “I can just tell you no, right here, right now. There will be no\naccommodation between us.”\n“Fen, Fen,” Taravangian said. “Are you not a merchant? A queen of\nmerchants? Are you absolutely certain you want to reject an offer before\nyou even hear the terms?”\n“I can’t imagine any terms,” Fen said, “that would convince me to give\nup my country to you.”\n“Then what harm is there in listening?” Taravangian asked. “It will keep\nme distracted, after all. Wouldn’t an extended negotiation serve you best?\nSo long as I have hope to persuade you, I obviously won’t need to try other\nploys for the city.”\nShe eyed him. “Well, storms,” she said under her breath. “It truly is you,\nisn’t it?”\n“It truly is,” Taravangian said. “Jasnah, you’ve confirmed with your\nWit?”\n“I have,” she admitted."

I promise to deploy no tricks against\nyou, and no attacks upon this city, during our conversation. It is a promise\nthat, in making, I am bound by deific powers to keep.”\nJasnah looked at Fen, who looked back. Finally, the two of them picked\nup chairs—reminiscent of the way Dalinar insisted they all carry seats at\nUrithiru—and placed them in a circle with Taravangian at the center of the\nchamber. With a sigh, he made his stools vanish.\n“How is this going to proceed?” Fen said as she sat. “You make an\nargument, and Jasnah counters it?”\n“Actually,” Taravangian said, smiling, “I believe Jasnah is going to make\nmy argument for me.”\n“What?” Jasnah said, nearly scattering the stacks of papers in her lap.\n“You, Jasnah,” Taravangian said. “You are the reason Fen will decide to\njoin my empire.” He smiled more broadly. “Thank you for your service all\nof these years. Now, let us begin.”\nIn every game are a hundred paths to failure. But not always a\nsingle one to victory. It is not weakness to admit that another\ngeneral must fight this foe another day.\n—Proverbs for Towers and War, Zenaz, date unknown\nSpear in hand, Kaladin backed away from Nale and evaluated the\nbattlefield. The inside of an old monastery building, the roof broken down,\nstone blocks from the large fallen chimney—to his left—and hearth\ncrumpled toward the center of the room.\n“The day I warned you about is nearly here,” the Wind whispered. “The\nstorm. Tomorrow. I need you tomorrow.”\n“Then I’ll have to survive,” Kaladin said. “Any chance I could get your\nhelp?”\n“I am weak,” the Wind whispered. “I … have nothing but my voice,\nKaladin.”\nWell then. Without his powers, Nale was only a person, right? The black-\nsuited man swiped with his Shardblade, cutting the air, standing ten feet in\nfront of Kaladin and watching with keen eyes. He did not immediately\nengage.\nDuring the invasion of Urithiru, Kaladin had gotten plenty of practice\ndrawing on his old training to fight without powers. He set his stance, spear\npointed at Nale. The man finally started moving, easing to the right around\nthe perimeter, past Szeth, boots scraping stone. He faced Kaladin from by\nthe wall, just within its shadows—then he lunged into the sunlight.\nKaladin used his spear to shove the Blade away, but didn’t take the bait\nto strike. That had been a test, as Nale—with sword instead of spear—had a\nreach disadvantage. His motions precise, every step deliberate, he rounded\nKaladin, then came in with another strike. Again Kaladin deflected, though\nthe man’s precision and lack of expression unnerved him."

Again Kaladin deflected, though\nthe man’s precision and lack of expression unnerved him.\nNale was a man … and also not one, all at once. He was ancient. In\nmany ways completely unknowable.\nCalm, Kaladin told himself. You fought the Pursuer, you fought Leshwi.\nYou’ve defeated ancients before.\nKaladin’s training told him what would likely happen next. Another\ntesting strike, which came, and he deflected it. Now the real strike. Nale\nswung a fourth time, but instead of backing off as Kaladin deflected, the\nHerald shoved in close, trying to fling Kaladin’s spear to the side.\nKaladin wouldn’t have it. He kept firm, withdrawing a few steps, but\ntraining the spear on Nale and nearly skewering him—forcing the Herald\naway.\nNale continued to stride around him. “Good,” he said. “Good.”\nNot the expected reaction. While Kaladin could anticipate this man’s\nattacks, Nale’s motives were as opaque as ever.\nOddly, Wit’s words returned to him. The fight ahead of you is going to be\nlegendary. Unfortunately, you can’t fight this one with strength of muscle …\nThe next few exchanges were more aggressive, but Kaladin controlled\nthe clashes. The man with the spear should always control the fight, because\nwhen he lost that control—when the swordsman got in close—that was it.\nNo, Kaladin thought. You have Plate now. Use it. He needed more\ntraining with his armor; strategically taking hits on it was a common\npractice for Shardbearers.\nNale came in again. Kaladin let him get close and swing at Kaladin’s\nhead—while Kaladin himself formed Syl into a long knife. Metal clanged\nagainst metal as Nale’s Blade hit, and a web of cracks appeared in the air to\nthe left of Kaladin’s head, but he stabbed the knife directly at Nale’s gut.\nThe Herald managed to sidestep, just barely, then he danced backward.\nKaladin managed a small slit in Nale’s fine black uniform, along his side.\nKaladin smiled. The spiderweb of cracks in the air by his head turned blue,\nand his armor came fully alert to the danger. It formed—starting a tiny bit\nout from his skin, then pulling in and locking into place, completely\nencasing Kaladin. Leyten would have fits about Kaladin’s jacket getting\nwrinkled, but the Shardplate took that—and everything else—into account,\nforming perfectly, allowing full movement.\nKaladin wasn’t certain of the specifics; his armor was always there these\ndays, protecting him. But it wasn’t fully there until the danger was real.\nRegardless, he spun his Shardspear and stepped back, armored foot now\nfalling hard and crunching on rubble. A glow came from his chest and from\nother junctions along the sleek armor, and the visor—which he knew\nglowed from the slits—was transparent to him.\nHe now felt the weight and power of the Shardplate, a strength he hadn’t\nfully mastered. Yet he had a certain … intrinsic understanding of it. This\nwas his Plate, not some castoff from another Radiant. The windspren who"

The windspren who\nformed it were his companions, and had come to his call at the Fourth Ideal.\nNale swiped with his Blade—his Radiant Blade, it seemed, not his\nHonorblade—strolling around Kaladin. He didn’t summon his own Plate.\nShouldn’t it have deflected Kaladin’s strike earlier?\nNale fell into an unfamiliar stance, sword held forward, then waved for\nKaladin to approach and try some strikes of his own. Spear in hand, Kaladin\ndid so, clashing with Nale, Plated feet grinding stone, spear clanging\nagainst sword. Kaladin didn’t connect, but still Nale’s Plate didn’t appear.\nAt least, he let a spear thrust go straight past his cheek—a hair from slicing\nhim—and it didn’t collide with anything.\nKaladin pulled away. Truth was, he didn’t want to hurt Nale, and the\nman might have suspected Kaladin’s heart wasn’t in their exchanges—for\nhe soon went back on the offensive.\nKaladin stepped into his flurry of strikes, taking another hit on the head,\nbut sweeping for Nale’s legs with the butt of his spear, which formed into a\nhook. The man jumped over the attack, then slammed his sword into\nKaladin’s head yet again. With a curse, Kaladin stumbled back. His helm\nwas leaking furiously, a web of cracks crossing his vision. His armor\nseemed stronger than ordinary Shardplate, and was powered not by\ngemstones but by its own Connection to the Spiritual Realm, but Sigzil\nhadn’t had time to run tests. Kaladin didn’t want to take a fourth hit in the\nsame spot if he could help it.\nHe came in once more, more careful, forming Syl into a giant Blade and\nsweeping at Nale, who easily dodged.\n“You did better without the Plate, Stormblessed,” Nale said in his\npassionless voice. “How long have you had it?”\nPlate formed around Nale in a heartbeat, and he slammed an armored fist\ninto Kaladin’s chest—sending him stumbling backward to the ground,\nwhere he crashed in a heap, metal grinding on stone. Nale’s armor vanished,\nbecoming mist, and he strolled forward. “Do better. I would not have you\ndie in such a pitiful way.”\nKaladin clambered to his feet, then mostly dismissed his Plate. He\nneeded more training to use it properly. As it faded though, he knew the\nspren would remain, guarding him.\n“Good,” Nale said, falling into a stance again.\nKaladin raised his spear, then advanced on Nale, forcing him back\nthrough the rubble-strewn room. Szeth watched from the side, concern\nshowing in his widened eyes, in his tense hold on his pack of swords—\nincluding Nightblood.\nThis guy, Syl said in Kaladin’s head. Have we ever fought someone so\nannoying?\n“Amaram,” Kaladin whispered.\nOh yeah. He was an absolute tool, wasn’t he?

Be careful with your footing—but don’t take your eyes\noff the target. Strike because you decide to, not because you’re anxious.\nHe got in several very close thrusts, and expertly kept Nale at bay.\n“Good,” the man said. “This is a man I can kill with confidence.”\n“You keep saying that,” Kaladin said, sweat trickling down his brows.\n“Well, come on then. Try.”\nNale did. Sweeping attacks with his Blade from a stance Kaladin didn’t\nknow—like Windstance, only more frantic. Kaladin should have had the\nadvantage with his longer reach, but now he was forced back. He thrust, but\neach time just a little too slowly. He still managed to fend off the attacks\nuntil right at the end, when he went to block a sweep from Nale’s Blade.\nNale, in a blink, was holding a spear instead. He rammed it forward,\nsquare into Kaladin’s face—where the invisible helmet barely caught it. The\ntip pierced the armor, cracking it fully, and stopped right between Kaladin’s\neyes, almost touching the skin.\nWatch it, Kal, Syl said in his head. That was a little close …\nThey clashed again, and yet again Kaladin almost got a strike on Nale.\nBy now Kaladin was puffing, sweating. This careful, deliberate contest\nreminded him of the fights he’d had with Leshwi. But those had been fights\nagainst a rival he respected, and this felt different. Storms, it was hard.\nKaladin kept having to push himself more than he wanted, overextending to\ntry to land a hit—and he kept missing anyway.\n“You are good,” Nale said, breaking off, then calmly walking through\nthe chamber to Kaladin’s right. “I have looked into your past, Stormblessed.\nYou—the one who slipped past me, the one I should have found and killed.\nI know you have had a difficult life. It would have been better if you’d died\nby young Helaran’s Blade.”\nKaladin hesitated, gripping his spear, which had changed from smooth to\ncovered in tiny ridges to give his sweaty hands more purchase. Helaran.\nShallan’s brother. It was sometimes difficult to remember that one event had\nset all this off: Kaladin unexpectedly finding a Shardbearer on the\nbattlefield. A Skybreaker acolyte sent to murder Amaram, to prevent him\nfrom looking into the secrets of the vanished Knights Radiant.\n“It was you,” Kaladin said. “You sent him.”\n“I wish I’d known,” Nale said, “that the key target was not Amaram, but\none of his squadleaders. I would have gone myself and made sure you\ndidn’t leave that battlefield alive.”\nHe’s so strange, Syl thought at him. He’s always had this broken belief\nthat if he killed the Radiants, it would prevent the Desolation. But we came\nback because we felt the Desolation coming.\n“Why?” Kaladin said to Nale. “The Desolation would still have come.\nSyl sought me out because she felt the storm moving through Shadesmar.\nTaln Returned, finally breaking. Your killing all those Radiants\naccomplished nothing.”"

Your killing all those Radiants\naccomplished nothing.”\nNale froze, and Kaladin saw something: a flash of emotion, a chink in\nhis armor. He looked away, as if remembering, then put his hand to his\nchest. “Do you know a young Radiant named Lift?” Nale asked.\n“I do,” Kaladin said. “Why?”\n“She is the only one to have ever defeated me in single combat,” Nale\nsaid softly.\n“Please tell me she didn’t use the fork,” Kaladin said.\n“No. No, it was a different weapon entirely.” He focused again on\nKaladin. “You might be right. The Desolation may still have arrived.\nHowever, I’d have killed you, and been correct to do so—for I believed it\nwas the best course at the time, and was following what I’d been told.”\n“By whom?” Kaladin demanded.\n“Ishar, naturally,” Nale said. “Regardless: my choices were correct. Yes.\nIf I’d killed every potential Radiant, then would the spren have felt the\ndesire to return? No. Not at all.”\n“The Everstorm—” Kaladin said.\n“Is meaningless,” Nale said. “I am right.”\nHe’s working through his rationalizations, Syl said, and getting them\nmixed up again.\nLogic would never work. Emotion. Kaladin had to focus on emotion and\nmemory. How to make Nale remember?\n“That day …” Kaladin said. “Helaran came thundering in like a storm.\nHe killed my friends, left misery in his wake. Don’t you care? He murdered\na youth, a wounded child who was no threat. Cenn was his name.”\n“Collateral damage,” Nale said.\n“You say that about a child? Didn’t you care once, Nale? About the\ninnocents?”\nThe briefest moment of concern crossed his face. “I am here,” he said\nsoftly, “because of the innocents.”\n“Yet you kill them!”\n“I … follow the law,” Nale said. “Helaran joined the army that your lord\nwas fighting against, which gave him legal justification to kill as he\nneeded.” Nale looked up at Kaladin and pointed his sword straight at him.\n“I would kill a thousand youthful soldiers if my cause were just and the law\non my side.”\nKaladin’s grip tightened on his spear. He felt cold … and then warm.\nAnd then …\nAnd then he was back there. He was that man again, the one he’d\nproclaimed dead so many times. He remembered the smell of blood in the\nair on that field, so long ago, and the sound of Dallet repeating Kaladin’s\norders as he beat spear against shield to organize the squad.\nSzeth was the boy who needed Kaladin now. And Kaladin was here in\nthis fight not because of a compulsion—but because he had decided for\nhimself. Wit said he needed to discover who he was when he didn’t need to\nfight. Remarkably, Kaladin had begun to do that, he realized. New Kaladin\nstill protected, but accepted he might fail. He controlled his sense of loss.\nNot through callousness, as his father had tried to teach him. But through\nlove."

But through\nlove.\nMemory and present meshed together, and then Kaladin lunged and\nstruck. He anticipated exactly how Nale would dodge. Wind in his ears,\nKaladin changed the tip of his thrust perfectly, knowing that his strike\nwould be true.\nThis was the one. He had Nale.\nThen the Herald moved a little faster, blurring.\nKaladin missed. His spear passed right by Nale’s ear, striking only empty\nair.\nThat caused a moment of disconnect. Kaladin should have recovered and\nreset as training had drilled into him. Yet he knew he should have hit. Every\nscrap of instinct he had with the spear—the intimate familiarity that he\nseemed to have that others lacked—said that strike should have landed.\nHow had Nale possibly dodged?\n“Such an interesting aspect of Windrunners,” Nale said, stepping back.\n“If one enrages other people, they get sloppy. But put you in a position to\nprotect, make you see red, and we find you at your best.”\nKaladin struck again, and Nale leaned to the side, again impossibly fast.\nA little blur and shift.\nThis strike missed as well.\n“Good,” Nale said. “Yes, you’d likely have won by now if you were\nfacing most foes. You quite nearly killed me, Stormblessed. Be proud of\nthat. I would have you die with such pride.”\nKaladin gripped his spear again, then struck, struck, struck. Three\nprecise attacks, each as useless as the one before. Nale stepped around each\none. He didn’t even raise his Blade. He acted casual.\n“Fight me!” Kaladin said, leaping forward—\nNale was there. Stepping into the attack and around it, faster than\nKaladin could respond. Nale pressed his hand against Kaladin’s chest and\ntossed him to the ground. Sprawling.\nKaladin gaped, stunned—less physically than mentally. Never since his\nfirst days training with a spear had anyone treated him so indifferently in a\nfight.\nWhat … what was going on?\nKaladin? Syl said.\nHe picked himself up and backed away. That emotion making him cold,\nthat was fear. Powerlessness. He knew it. He’d felt it many times before,\nbut rarely while he’d held a spear.\n“If I am asked,” Nale said, striding forward, “I will be honest. You\nfought well. It is rare that I must use the true skills of a Herald against a\nmortal. We … do not deploy them frivolously.”\nSzeth stumbled between the two of them. “I’ll do as you say. I’ll obey,\nNin. It’s over!”\nNale calmly pushed Szeth out of his way and walked toward Kaladin. “I\nmust execute him, Szeth, now that I have legal authority to do so. His\ncorrupting influence on you must end.”\n“But—”\n“He agreed to this fight. It is settled. Stand down.”\n“It’s all right, Szeth,” Kaladin said, mind racing. “I’ll find a way to—”\nNale was there in front of him."

A\nlifetime of practice had trained Kaladin in what to expect. He could barely\ntrack—much less comprehend—the way Nale seized him by the arm, spun\nhim and took him in two hands, then smashed him against the stone wall of\nthe building.\nOnce. Twice. Thrice. Kaladin’s armor gave out as Nale treated him like a\nchild’s doll. The armor exploded, leaving Kaladin exposed. Then Nale\ntossed Kaladin aside.\nKaladin rolled hard along the ground, slamming into the nearby wall and\ncolliding with his pack. Limp, in pain, Kaladin wheezed for breath, his\nvision spinning. This was … this was something he’d never experienced …\nEven in his youth, the first time he’d picked up a spear, he’d felt somewhat\nin control.\nHe’d never been so utterly outmatched.\nHe looked up, blinded by pain, seeing the dark shadow of Nalan’Elin\napproach. Then he stopped as a figure formed in front of him. Syl?\n“This is not fair,” she said.\n“It is just.”\nHe tried to step around her and she moved back in front of him. “This?\nJustice?”\n“I am sorry, Ancient Daughter,” Nale said, still cold and calm. “You\nshould have stayed in Shadesmar as your father wished. Your pain is of\nyour own choosing.”\nNale stepped deliberately through her. Then pulled up short as another\nfigure formed in front of him, hands up as if to protect Kaladin. From the\nshape, through blurred vision, Kaladin could make out Szeth’s spren.\n“Stop, Nale!” the spren said. “Please.”\n“You,” Nale said, “are a disgrace to your kind. You were trained to be a\nlight to your human, not some kind of attendant to him and his will.”\nNale continued, ignoring both spren, ignoring Szeth’s cries. Kaladin took\na deep breath and prepared to stand, pressing his hands against the stone\nfloor, strewn with chips of rubble. And as he did, he heard something\ndistant, faint.\nThe sound of a flute.\nNo general can control a battlefield. He must instead learn to ride\nit like one does an untamed beast. But you can practice and\nprepare for that eventuality.\n—Proverbs for Towers and War, Zenaz, date unknown\nSuch an incongruous sound. A flute, the song Kaladin had been practicing,\ndrifting in the air. Frail.\nThe Wind, he realized, was trying to help the best she could. With her\nvoice.\n“I return your song to you, Kaladin,” she whispered. “As I once returned\nit to Cephandrius.”\nNale stopped and looked around, frowning. “That song again …” he\nsaid. “That rhythm …”\nI can’t win this battle with a spear, Kaladin thought.

Kaladin gasped, pain blinding his vision, as he felt his\ninsides crunch. He fell to his knees, and the flute slipped from his fingers\nand hit the floor.\nSzeth caught Kaladin and held out a pouch of spheres. “Take it! This\nisn’t a fight any longer. It’s an execution.”\nIn his pain, Kaladin drew in the Stormlight, though he couldn’t have said\nif it was a conscious choice or the response of a drowning man breaking the\nsurface for a frantic gasp. That began to heal him, and his vision recovered,\nbut as he reached for more, someone else got there first. Nale strode past,\nand Light streamed from the spheres in Szeth’s possession—from pouches\nby the walls as well, from gemstones Kaladin hadn’t remembered, tucked\ninto the bottom of his pack. Everything.\nIt seemed to favor Nale, streaming to him instead of Kaladin. The Herald\ndrew it in with arms outstretched—then let go. Allowing a puff of radiance\nto shimmer up into the air and vanish.\n“No Stormlight,” Nale said calmly. “That was the agreement.” He\nstepped forward and slammed a booted heel on the flute, crunching the\nwood, shattering it.\nKaladin cried out in dismay, reaching for the broken flute. Nale moved\nagain, pushing Szeth aside with enough force to throw him into the wall.\nKaladin had been healed enough to see clearly, though his Stormlight gave\nout. Without it, the Honorblades couldn’t grant Surges, and Nightblood\nwould consume their souls in a flash if drawn.\nLying on the ground, Kaladin stretched his fingers toward the broken\nflute again, tears in his eyes.\nKaladin, Syl said, I don’t understand why the flute matters.\n“Nale knows this song,” Kaladin whispered. “He knows this story. He\nunderstands, deep down, what it means to care for people more than rules. I\nknow it, Syl. We have to remind him. We have to make him remember.”\nKaladin reached out, and something silvery formed in his hand from\nRadiant mist. A flute made all of metal.\nThis is dangerous though! Syl said. Maybe we should run.\nBut the Wind kept returning his music to him, in the distance. Halting,\nfaulty notes. Echoes from when he’d practiced. Kaladin, panting, heaved to\nhis feet and backed away from Nale.\nThe Herald was ignoring him, continuing to walk with his head cocked.\nListening. “That song … it’s the song you played.

        "text": "the notes that led us to Roshar all those millennia ago …”\nWind blew through the broken monastery, a soft wind, a teasing wind. It\ntouched the flute and a quiet note sounded, vibrating the instrument in\nKaladin’s hand. The other notes outside grew stronger, overlapping one\nanother, as if five or six flutists were playing and not one.\nNale moved to one of the arrow-slit windows and peered out. “What is\nthis? What army comes to your aid?” He glanced back at Kaladin.\n“Nothing. Just hills …” He narrowed his eyes. “Offworlder magic. You’ve\nbeen talking to Midius. His illusions are meaningless against one who\nknows them for the falsehoods they are, Stormblessed.”\nNale spun and raised his sword in two hands, point toward Kaladin. In\nreturn, Kaladin put the flute to his lips, and blew a few bars of the melody\nhe’d been practicing. This flute seemed more natural to his fingers and lips.\nSimple though the tune was, he felt enormous pride at the lack of mistakes.\nHe raised his head from the flute, looked Nale—who had stopped again\n—in the eyes. “This story is about Derethil and the Wandersail.”\nNale’s calmness cracked as he gritted his teeth and surged forward, but\nhis strange speed failed him. He stumbled. Kaladin was able to back up to\nescape Nale’s reach. The Wind almost seemed to lift him as he hopped over\nthe pile of rubble that had been the monastery chimney.\nLanding on the other side, Kaladin shouted, “Have you heard it? The\nstory of how Derethil and his crew made their way to a hidden island in the\nEndless Ocean? A land where everything appeared so perfect at first?”\nNale slowed. “I do not pay attention to made-up stories.”\n“Pity,” Kaladin said. “They have proven to be some of the most real\nthings in my life.” He presented the flute, which the Wind played in his\nhand. “Derethil and his crew set out to cross the ocean and find out what\nwas on the other side. Some say they sought the place the Voidbringers\nwere born. Others say Derethil sought the Origin itself, that mythical place\nwhere storms begin and Light is most powerful.\n“I do not know the ultimate result of their voyage, but I do know that\nthey wrecked on an island called Uvala, near a mighty whirlpool. A tall\npeople lived there, who wore shells in their hair unlike any that grew on\nRoshar. They cared for Derethil and his crew. Everything seemed so perfect.\nSo ideal. No need for guards, or police, or anything of the sort.”\nNale growled, a bit of true emotion, but again stopped in place as the\nmusic outside—sounding like a dozen flutes now—increased in volume.\nEchoes of Kaladin’s practice overlapping, forming a cohesive song. Nale\nlooked one way, then the other.\n“Why did you become a Herald, Nale?” Kaladin asked softly. “Do you\nremember? Can you remember how you felt?”\n“Emotion can’t be trusted!”\n“Is it your emotions you can’t trust,” Kaladin said, “or your mind?”\n“I … I used to see clearly …” he said, tipping his head back. “I thought I"

You felt yourself slipping, didn’t you? You knew your logic failed.\nYou knew you were getting worse, so you fixated on something external,\nhoping it would be a guiding light as your own mind deteriorated.”\nNale growled, glaring at him. “The law is perfect.”\nKaladin pointed the flute at him, and spoke in rhythm to the music. “One\nday, on this perfect island, Derethil saw something unnerving. A serving girl\nmade a mistake. She broke some goblets. The other people of the island\nattacked her and killed her brutally. Do you know why?”\n“It was obviously the law,” Nale growled.\n“The law of the emperor.”\n“The law must be obeyed,” Nale said, right fist toward Kaladin—his\nsword as if forgotten in his other hand. “Stop fleeing your destiny,\nStormblessed!”\nKaladin rounded Nale, his chest still aching from the hit. “Do you\nremember finding people trapped in rubble? Darkness, followed by light, as\nyou—smothered in ash and blood—worked to save those trapped beneath\nthe wreckage?”\n“That happened many times,” Nale said. “Too many times.”\n“Do you remember,” Kaladin continued, “a child who cowered in a\ncorner as figures with glowing red eyes broke down the doorway … and\nwas saved as you came back seeking those who had been left behind?”\n“I …” Nale cocked his head to the music.\n“Gratitude,” Kaladin said. “Do you remember their gratitude as you\nstood before the weak and ignored, blood dripping down your arm as you\nheld out your sword … like a banner …”\n“You will not have them,” Nale whispered. He looked to Kaladin, and\nthere were tears at the corners of his eyes. “I woke one day … this must\nhave been a thousand years ago or more … and I realized I’d hurt someone\nby accident. Out of irritation. I thought … I’m losing it. Losing myself.”\n“So you sought a way to control your actions.”\n“I turned to the law,” Nale whispered. “To force myself to hold on to the\nperson I wanted to be. Because … I couldn’t trust my mind anymore …”\nKaladin had positioned himself with his back to the large gates at the\nfront of the chamber. Here he stopped, brandishing the flute, with the Wind\nblowing through it.\n“I can’t go back!” Nale shouted. But he seemed … afraid of Kaladin. He\nretreated as he spoke, his words and tone defiant. “I can’t trust you, or what\nI see, or what I think! There is only one ANSWER. I must follow the law!”\n“Derethil and his men,” Kaladin said, accompanied by the flute playing\nin his fingers, “discovered more instances of brutality from the people of\nUvala.

They stormed the tower to demand\naccountability!”\nNale snarled, then strode to the side of the room and grabbed the still-\ndazed Szeth—who had been listening to the music in awe—from next to the\nwall. Nale placed his Shardblade to Szeth’s throat.\n“Come fight me!” Nale said.\nThe music outside softened. The flute in his fingers became as quiet as a\nwhisper. It felt anticipatory to Kaladin, the held breath before a storm.\n“Nale,” Kaladin said, “is this what you’ve become?”\nThe Herald paused. He glanced at Szeth, and seemed to see him in a new\nlight. He dropped Szeth and again put his hand to his chest.\nThen he looked to Kaladin, and his calm shattered, emotion streaking his\nface with lines of anger as he shouted, “This is your fault! It all made sense\nbefore you!” He started toward Kaladin again, sword held high. “You are\nmy flaw! You are the one I let slip past, who started the events that ruined it\nall! You are the cause for ALL of this!”\nKaladin raised his arms to the sides.\nWind erupted through the gates of the monastery, slamming the doors\nopen, carrying with it music. An overwhelming stampede of sound, a\nthousand flutes playing at once. Every practice Kaladin had done, captured\nby the Wind and belted out in a tide of song.\nIt hit Nale with a physical force. The Herald leaned back and faltered,\neyes going wide, as if staring into a bright, all-consuming light.\n“What did they find!” Kaladin shouted at him. “What did they find in the\ntop of the tower, Nale?”\nThe man whimpered and stepped back.\n“WHAT WAS IN THE TOWER?” Kaladin bellowed.\n“NOTHING!” Nale yelled back, his face a mask of pain, tears streaming\ndown his cheeks. “There was nothing in the tower! There was …” Nale fell\nto his knees. “There was nothing! He’s dead.”\nNale dropped his Blade. He looked at his hands, then at Kaladin as the\nmusic drifted away, the tide becoming a stream.\n“Honor is … is dead,” Nale whispered. “Jezrien is … is gone. Ishar is …\nas good … as good as dead too …”\n“Derethil learned a lesson that day—one I’ve learned, and you must\nlearn. Even if an emperor makes the laws, when we uphold them, the laws\nbecome ours. The responsibility ours. And every action those people took\n… that blood was on their hands.”\nNale wept openly.\n“Why,” Kaladin repeated, “did you become a Herald, Nale?”\nThe bald man looked up at him, seeming a completely different person\nfrom moments ago. “I feared the others, highborn save Taln, would forget\nthe little people of the lands.

Oh … my god … What has happened to me? What has become\nof me?” He blinked through the tears. “The law cannot shelter me. Why?\nWhy can’t I see right anymore? Do you think … do you think that black\nsword could destroy me?”\nKaladin gripped his flute tighter and stood above the pitiful man\nkneeling on the ground. Demigod. Broken. A moment later, Szeth stumbled\nup beside him.\nThen, Szeth reached a trembling hand out to Nale. “We can help you,”\nhe said softly. “We can’t make it all better, but we can help. Right,\nKaladin?”\nEven those I hate, Kaladin thought. “Yes, we can help, Nale. We will\nhelp.”\nNale broke down weeping as he took Szeth’s hand, but then stayed on\nhis knees—clinging to it, wetting the broken ground of the monastery with\nhis tears. Two figures appeared. Syl on one side, 12124 on the other.\nThe final figure, Nale’s spren, emerged as a rip in the sky nearby. Not in\nthe shape of a person. Then it streaked off and vanished.\nNINE YEARS AGO\nI’m sorry, honor-nimi,” Lumo said. “I cannot authorize this for one\nHonorbearer. I just … Szeth, you have to know how this looks. It’s insane.”\n“It’s Truth, Lumo,” Szeth said.\nHe stood, Blade in hand, before his old home on the clifftop—the small\ntown and warcamp outside the Stoneward monastery. He stood in roughly\nthe last place he’d seen his mother before leaving.\nShe lived in a city a short flight away. He had been tempted to seek her\nout, but … not like this. He would wait until he was seen as a hero.\nStrange, how much this place he’d hated now felt like returning home.\nHe’d saved Lumo years ago from a burning ship during that infamous\nattack on the raiders. The red-bearded man was now the General of the\nentire place. Straight-backed, tall, with a neat uniform. This camp\nmaintained the discipline that Neturo had instilled; that was clear from the\nsoldiers arrayed to meet Szeth.\nSoldiers who, despite his history with them, didn’t believe.\n“Can you offer proof?” Lumo asked.\n“My own word is my proof,” Szeth said. “And my station as\nHonorbearer.”\n“Honorbearer Pozen visited us last night,” Lumo said softly. “Elsecalled\nright into the center of the camp. He said you were a delusional heretic who\ncouldn’t be trusted.”\n“And what,” Szeth said quietly, “do you think of Pozen?”\nThe soldiers shared looks. All was still for a moment as a cold, highland\nbreeze greeted them.\n“He is not a soldier,” Szeth said. “Did he send us help when we held here\nalone against raiders? Did he bring his Blade and fight by our side? Did he\neven seem to care?”\nThey did not respond."

Right\nbefore I left you, I was to be banished—then suddenly the narrative\nchanged, bizarrely, and I was rewarded. It was the Unmade. They all obey\nit. I swear it to you.”\n“You … hear a voice,” Lumo said. “Telling you to do things.”\n“Each Honorbearer does,” Szeth said.\nSilence. He knew, from their expressions, that he had failed. These\ncapable soldiers were lost to him. At least that was what he assumed, until\nsalvation arrived.\nIn the form of an enemy army.\nOne of Lumo’s soldiers spotted it, raising the alarm. The banners, Szeth\nsaw as he turned, were of the other monasteries. An army multiple times\nlarger than his, emerging through an Elsecalled portal to fight.\nIn that moment, he knew retreat was impossible against Elsegates.\n“It is time,” Szeth said. “We fight.”\n“I cannot join you, Szeth,” Lumo said, pained.\n“Then,” Szeth said, meeting his eyes, “you shall instead have to watch\nthem slaughter me.”\nShortly thereafter, Szeth raised the flag of rebellion and led his army against\nthe forces of the Honorbearers. But today he did not kill.\nThe way he’d slain dozens in the previous battle haunted him. He felt as\nif their souls watched him from the quiet places beneath the stones, where\nthe spren were said to lurk. He knew why the Honorbearers refused to use\ntheir weapons against the raiders, although he hadn’t said so to Lumo. It\nwas too much.\nSo today, he led. He glowed, he hovered before his men, and he shouted\nencouragement. They were outnumbered, but at least had their backs to the\ncliffs, so they couldn’t be surrounded. He thought this position must be\ngood, as his soldiers would fight more valiantly, knowing the weakness of a\nretreat was forbidden them. Indeed, they fought better this time, even if the\nindividual soldiers missed a great number of strikes, and didn’t seem to\nunderstand the flow of the conflict.\nSzeth kept them fighting with shouts and orders, and because he didn’t\nfight, the other Honorbearers didn’t join the fray. He could see their\nbanners, one from each of the other monasteries. Including the Bondsmith\nmonastery, which was curious. So he was arrayed against seven banners, all\nbut the Windrunner, Stoneward, and Skybreaker.\nHe let his armies begin retreating up the switchback to the clifftop\nwarcamp, but only under pressure from his shamans. Still, he kept them\nfighting. He kept them desperate, until …\nAt last.\nThe armies of the Stoneward monastery above came to Szeth’s rescue.\nAs he’d hoped, they were unable to watch as one of their own was\ndestroyed. Szeth rose into the air, afire with Stormlight, listening to the\nglorious sound of their trumpets. Crystal-clear notes accompanying a force\nmarching down the switchbacks to join Szeth’s troops."

Crystal-clear notes accompanying a force\nmarching down the switchbacks to join Szeth’s troops.\nSomething swelled in Szeth at the sound, the sign of that glorious force\nmarching with bright helmets and shields held high. This was the moment\nwhen his flaming ember became a wildfire. The moment when resistance\nagainst the Voidbringers truly began, and the Desolation was opposed.\nHe landed in a storm of light. “It’s true,” whispered Drodli, one of his\nhead shamans, his helmet askew with a dent in one side, and blood—not his\n—on his armor. “They are coming, as you said. What … what would we\nhave done if they hadn’t?”\n“We’d have died,” Szeth said calmly. “Better to die than to let the Return\nhappen unresisted.”\nDrodli gave him a horrified look at that. Never mind. Better soldiers\nwere coming. His shamans were, he noticed, yelling for the men to take\nheart at the sight—something he likely should have done. Instead he flew\nup to speak to Lumo at the head of the new troops.\n“We’ll fight, Szeth,” he said, “but only because you’re on the defensive\n—and they apparently want to exterminate you. Something strange is going\non, and it’s time that we had some respect here, rather than being\nconsidered second-class because we lack an Honorbearer.”\nThose were not quite the words of a glorious champion for Truth, but\nthey would do. Szeth flew back down, and the Stoneward army began to\nsupport his ranks. As the troops were bolstered, stabilizing on the incline—a\nfavorable position—he shouted a challenge to the enemy armies.\nOther Honorbearers materialized. First Moss, who should have been his\nfriend, then Sivi. Pozen was making those closest to Szeth come first,\nhoping they would die by his Blade.\nWell, today he refused. He was no assassin, no murderer crafted to do\nevil. He sought them out and clashed with them, but made no killing blows.\nHe merely fought until Moss broke and fled. Sivi waited until that fight was\ndone, then came in next.\nThough she could bend the stones to her will, he made certain not to\nleave the soil. She refused to Elsegate away, and so theirs was mostly a duel\nof sword against sword, fought on the ground in the middle of the enemy\nranks—who made room for them, and did not try to interfere.\nSzeth did her the honor of minimizing his use of powers, and therefore\nhad to spend a good five minutes fighting until he managed to disarm her\nand send her sprawling across the grass in a heap, her short hair falling and\nobscuring her eyes.\n“You’re strong,” she whispered. “Stones Unhallowed … how did you get\nso strong?”\n“Because,” he said, leveling his Blade at her, “I fight to protect our land.\nJoin me, and we will be two.”\n“Szeth,” she said. “You’re confused. That wasn’t an Unmade you saw.”\n“I will not be persuaded by you.”\nShe sighed and sat up. “Well, at least you let yourself be distracted by a\nduel.”\nDistracted?"

He turned, with horror, and saw the\ntroops from the Stoneward monastery retreating. No, worse—re-forming\nand turning their weapons against his troops, who were now trapped\nbetween two enemy forces.\n“Traitors!” Szeth shouted. “Treason!”\nEverything crumbled. His vision of a glorious resistance. His men\nleading a wildfire of change that saved the world itself. He screamed in\ndenial, and shot through the sky on a Lashing, an arrow in flight. He\nslammed against the ground between his forces and those of the traitors,\nLumo at their head. He opened his mouth to demand answers … and a\nfigure stepped out from among them.\nA stout man with a short beard, thinning hair, a friendly smile. Neturo.\nHis father.\nA lightning bolt of shock jolted through Szeth. His father was a captive.\nA prisoner. A … a …\n“Hello, son,” Neturo said, stopping a few feet in front of him. “We\nthought that Lumo and his troops might listen to reason if I spoke to them.”\n“Lightweaving,” Szeth whispered. “You aren’t real.”\n“I’m sorry,” Neturo said, wearing his old uniform, but with new colors.\nBlue, brown, and green. The …\nThe Bondsmith colors.\nNeturo summoned an Honorblade, with a wavy blade and writing along\nit, then placed it into the ground in front of him. “I am real, Szeth. When\nSivi and Pozen came to me with this offer, I didn’t know what to think.\nGrand senator? Bondsmith? Leader of our people? They said it might be the\nonly way to save you. So I listened. And … well, I’ve heard him now, son.”\n“The Voice?” Szeth whispered.\n“He says you turned your back on him.”\n“Father, he’s—”\n“He’s not a Voidbringer, son,” Neturo said. “I’ve met him. I don’t know\nwhat he is. A god perhaps, as he says—but he’s not one of them.”\n“I …” Szeth put a hand to his forehead. “No. You can’t be … can’t be\nreal …”\nNeturo dismissed his Blade, then stepped forward, arms out, and Szeth\nbacked up. His father kept coming until he embraced Szeth. And … stones\n… it was him.\n“We have to stop this madness,” Neturo said. “The Voice is committed,\nbut I know there must be another way.”\n“I’m following my heart, Father,” Szeth whispered. “I’m trying to do\nwhat is right. I’ve always tried to do what is right.”\n“I know,” Neturo said. “I know.”\nSzeth squeezed his eyes closed, and he was a little boy again. Standing\nbefore a rock that would go on to kill every bit of joy in his life.\n“Szeth,” his father said, his arms warm, his voice warmer, “I’ve realized\nwhy I followed you all those years.”\n“Why?”\n“I thought you might lead me to answers.” He gave Szeth a squeeze.\n“You did.”\nNeturo …\nNeturo had answers."

He’d\nkilled dozens with an Honorblade. He’d raised an army to fight his own\npeople. If he was wrong …\nWhy had he thought he could trust his own judgment? He was a fool,\nand a child, and he always had been.\n“Tell me what to do,” Szeth whispered. “And I’ll do it. If you tell me.”\nThe first rule of warfare is to know your enemy.

What had\nTaravangian just said?\nThat she would persuade Fen to join his cause? That Jasnah had been\nworking for Odium?\n“Don’t be ridiculous,” Jasnah said. “Fen, I’ve never worked for\nTaravangian, unless you count one time when I was hired to help his\ngranddaughter. Stating that I have done so all along is an indication of his\nintent to lie.”\n“It’s no lie,” Taravangian said, extending his hands as he sat across from\nher—palms up, his golden cane leaning against his thigh. “But it is perhaps\na tad melodramatic. I can’t help myself sometimes.” He met Jasnah’s eyes.\n“You don’t know that you’ve been serving me, Jasnah. But you have been,\nall your life, regardless.”\n“Insanity,” she said, feeling cold. “Is this really your opening argument?\nLet’s move to the political debate.”\n“We’ll get there,” he said, his light brown eyes holding hers. “Tell me,\nJasnah. What is your fundamental guiding principle? The philosophy by\nwhich you live your life?”\n“I follow the Philosophy of Aspiration,” she said. “I’ve made no attempt\nto hide that. I do good, Taravangian, whatever it takes.”\n“Ah …” he said. “Not merely good, though. The most good possible, for\nthe most people.”\n“Correct.”\n“Then we are aligned,” he said, turning to Fen. “Jasnah and I hold to the\nsame philosophy. It will be easy, then, for the two of us to explain why\nThaylenah should join with me.”\nJasnah ground her teeth. “Don’t let him steer,” Ivory warned in her ear,\nfrom where he rode on her earring.\n“I reject that assertion,” Jasnah said, then she looked to Fen, who sat\nwatching with interest. “Fen, I’ve studied philosophy all my life—and I’ve\ndetermined that what I need to do is seek the greatest and best good for all\npeople. I’ve dedicated myself to this cause—you know that I have.

If I gave them\nsuch promises?”\n“There would still be no reason for her to accept. Peace is already on the\nway for her per my uncle’s actions. Why would Fen agree to join with you\nnow, a day before that arrives?”\n“Oh, but there you are wrong,” Taravangian said. He looked to Fen. “My\nfriend, I am required by dictates of my conscience to see this planet unified,\nbecause that will lead to the greatest goodness that could ever encompass\nRoshar. Over the last millennia, wars were fought between humans, while\nthe singers lived lives of enslaved agony. Misery has been the greatest\ncurrency of your kingdoms for generations. But I can make that go away.”\n“Dalinar’s covenant will enforce peace,” Fen said.\n“Between my empire and the kingdoms of humankind,” Taravangian\nsaid softly. “Not between humans themselves.”\n“We have treaties with Fen.”\n“Ah,” Taravangian said, “but how often do mortals break treaties? Did\nnot your war on the Shattered Plains begin that way? How well did your\nown father, Jasnah, keep his word? I believe he had treaties with Jah Keved,\nyet skirmishes and power struggles still happened.” He turned to Fen. “Our\nagreement locks borders into place, but you know how fickle humans are.\nHuman nations may continue fighting one another, as they can ignore words\non the page.”\nJasnah blessed her preparations. She’d caught this one as a likely\nargument—it was, after all, a natural outgrowth of the treaty. Odium had to\nhold to his word, but humans did not.\n“Is he right?” Fen said. “I thought Dalinar’s covenant froze the borders\nof nations, and they would be magically—supernaturally—impossible to\nbreak.”\n“Not exactly,” Jasnah said. “Odium is bound by the dictates of being a\ndivinity, so—and Wit agrees—he will be forced to abide by the contract. He\n‘vowed to cease hostilities and maintain the peace, not working against\nDalinar, his allies, or their kingdoms in any way.’ So, he must prevent acts\nof war between the people in regions he rules and ours, for a period of one\nthousand years. The rest of us humans are free to do as we wish, and could\ntheoretically attack each other without breaking the contract with Odium.\nFortunately, you know my uncle, and you know me. We will not attack\nyou.”\n“And your grandchildren?” Taravangian asked. “Their grandchildren?”\nHe pressed a hand to his chest. “I’m immortal. I will enforce peace among\nthe nations that follow me. If you join me, Fen, I will see that your\ngrandchildren do not die in useless wars.

If you turn me away, I will be forced to\ndo so. For your own good.”\nRiding a chasmfiend was more difficult than Venli had assumed. As she and\nthe other listeners geared up on a staging plateau—in preparation for\nattacking the human position—the others explained how to hold to the\nropes they looped around the beast’s neck and body, how to brace herself\nupon outcroppings of carapace.\n“It’s easy, once you get the hang of it,” Thude said to Confidence.\nVenli figured she could have made a list a mile long of things that were\neasy “once you got the hang of them.” She determined to crouch instead of\nstanding tall like Thude, holding to the ropes. They weren’t reins—you\ncouldn’t control a chasmfiend. You could merely make suggestions via the\nrhythms you sang. The ropes were wholly for the benefit of the riders.\nRed lightning rumbled above, reminding her even more of that terrible\nnight when she and the others had first unveiled the Everstorm. It didn’t\nhelp that the humans were in basically the same position, holding Narak\nwith darkened, worried eyes, shadowed within helms, anticipationspren\nwaving around them. Their walls were cracked, their Stormlight almost out.\nUnlike last time, when the humans had fought newly born stormforms,\nthey faced a battle-hardened army led by immortals.

Their\nthunderclast was dead, and needed time to return, and the humans had\nsuccessfully killed over half of the Focused Ones. She’d heard the Fused\ntalking. The arrival of Venli’s group mattered because they had brought\nbeasts capable of legitimately challenging Shardbearers and breaking down\nwalls.\nA Husked One appeared beside them, a femalen with glowing red eyes\nand a large, powerful figure, her woven hair forming clothing. “You will be\nthe second assault. Be ready to bring down those walls.”\n“The second?” Venli asked, surprised. “He’s not sending us in first?”\n“Be grateful El leads this battle,” she said. “I would gladly send you\ntraitors to die.” She spat to the side, something Venli had occasionally seen\nthe Fused do—but which baffled modern singers. A relic of their culture\nfrom long ago? “He wants to soften the enemy by personally trying to kill\nsome of their spren first.”\nTimbre trembled within her. This … changed the plan slightly. Venli had\nanticipated being the first wave. Thunder hammered them as the call went\nup, and a group of Heavenly Ones—not including Leshwi and her\nfollowers, who hovered nearby—went streaking toward the human air\nforces.\nSEVEN THOUSAND FIFTY YEARS AGO\nI, A , .

Turn them against him.\n—Proverbs for Towers and War, Zenaz, date unknown\nJasnah stood up at Taravangian’s threat to crush Thaylen City. “You said we\nwere safe! Now you say you’ve got the city in your hand, and threaten to\nsqueeze?”\n“So long as we talk,” he said, spreading his hands again, “I will not\nmove. That was my promise. I hold the sword at bay—though you should\nknow that while you were distracted by those empty ships, I put other plans\nin motion.” He looked to Fen. “You can either negotiate and come to me\npeacefully, or you come to me bloodied, burning. I’d welcome the former. I\nwill accept the latter.”\nJasnah felt alert, tense. To have a god say it so calmly …\n“What proof do you have of this claim?” Fen asked, obviously shaken by\nthe way she’d gone pale, gripping her knees with her hands as she sat.\n“I offer none but my word,” Taravangian said.\nOutside, clouds moved in front of the sun, and the small chamber\ndarkened briefly. The distant ocean waves seemed to still.\n“Not even he can know the future for certain,” Jasnah said, forcing\nherself to sit. “It’s a threat, not a promise.”\n“She is unfortunately right,” Taravangian said. “But my threats are not to\nbe taken lightly.”\n“So that’s it?” Fen said. “You come in here and demand I bend the\nknee?”\n“Do you love this city, Fen?” Taravangian asked.\n“With all my life.”\n“Then listen to me,” he said, leaning forward, clasping his hands. “I do\nnot have time to perpetuate petty wars on the surface of Roshar; I have\ngrander tasks to be about. I must take this city tonight. See that as a threat,\nbut also see me arriving here as an attempt to do it any other way. Come\nwith me, my friend, so that your people may prosper.”\nFen shook her head. “I don’t see how you possibly think this will work,\nTaravangian.”\n“My arguments will stand,” he said, gesturing to Jasnah without looking\nat her, “because Jasnah agrees. The smartest person you know, Fen, agrees\nwith me.”\n“This again?” Jasnah said. “I do not.”\n“We will see. But first, would you like to hear my entire offer, laid out\npoint by point?”"

        "text": "with me.”\n“This again?” Jasnah said. “I do not.”\n“We will see. But first, would you like to hear my entire offer, laid out\npoint by point?”\n“Please,” Fen said. “I thought I’d made that clear.”\n“Excellent,” he replied. He nodded to Jasnah, who nodded back, wanting\nto see his hidden card. “The first reason is as explained: I have forces\npoised to take this city and overthrow it. You, however, have a chance to\nprenegotiate a ceasefire.”\nJasnah frowned, remembering what Wit had taught her. “They are\nallowed to lie. It’s only a formal contract that they cannot break, and certain\noaths made to others of the same level of power.”\n“Nevertheless,” Taravangian said, “this point is absolutely true. But it is\nnot the main reason you should join with me, Fen. The main reason is my\nstrength, and that of my empire.”\nFen sniffed. “Break my oaths to the other monarchs to switch to the\npresumably winning side?”\n“Why not?” Odium said. “Fen, do you realize what will happen even if\nDalinar wins? I control most of the world—including the coasts.” He\nunfolded something from his pocket. “Here are contracts I’ve made, over\nthe last nine days, with each of the former Azish protectorates, or key cities\nin those protectorates in too much turmoil to claim entirely, plus other\nnotable cities across Roshar.\n“You know of Emul and Tashikk. I have here contracts with Steen,\nDawn’s Shadow, New Natanan, even Sesemalex Dar and Tukar—Ishar’s\nattention being elsewhere. These join my ports in Jah Keved, and my recent\nconquest in Karanak. In aggregate, I now control every major port on\nRoshar. Every one, Fen. Except, of course, Thaylen City.”\nShe took the papers hesitantly, and her eyes widened. Storms. Jasnah\nshould have anticipated this.\n“Check if you must,” Taravangian said. “Write to the leaders of these\nport cities.”\n“You’ll still have us, Fen,” Jasnah reminded. “You won’t be without\nallies.”\n“In the best of circumstances,” Taravangian said, “the only ports\navailable to you will be in Alethkar and Herdaz. Think on it, Fen. You will\nbe left with allies who are practically landlocked. You’ll face miles upon\nmiles of coast with no friendly berths. Nowhere to shelter from storms.\nNowhere to trade. What is a merchant city with no customers?”\n“Storms …” Fen whispered. She looked up at Jasnah. “I … Storms.”\n“My third point,” Taravangian said, “is that I can keep your people safe\nas no one else can. I realize that alone isn’t enough, but in the context of the\nrest? Because, Fen, the fourth point is extremely relevant. Even if Dalinar\nwins, you will want to be part of what I’m building.\n“I will give your people a contractual say in the management of my\nempire. A representation alongside the singers, something my predecessor\nwould never have done. You can work with me to shape the world, Fen."

You can work with me to shape the world, Fen.\nYour terms will be more favorable than any in your hand there. They will be\nspectacular, Fen. We’ll build a true empire, with Thaylenah as one of its\ncrown jewels.”\nHe leaned forward. “This is your chance, Fen, to negotiate for yourself.\nYou don’t have to rely on Dalinar, or his contest, or his word. You can make\nyour own deal. Isn’t that what your people excel at? Why let another lead?”\n“That’s bad,” Ivory whispered in Jasnah’s ear. “It is what Fen wants\nmost.”\n“Fen,” Jasnah said. “You have a voice with us.”\n“She … is right,” Fen said. “Taravangian, I’m already part of something.\nI like the coalition, for all its faults.”\n“And if Jasnah agrees you should leave it?” he asked. “Because she\nwill.”\n“Like Damnation I will,” Jasnah said.\n“Ah, and so here we are at last,” Taravangian said. “I have made my\noffer. Outlined my reasons. Tell us, Jasnah. What arguments can you\npresent that Fen should stay in your coalition?”\nJasnah calmed herself. She couldn’t focus on the full dissolution of the\nAzish empire; he’d presented this as a dramatic reveal, to make her fixate\nupon it—and not the point at hand. She therefore kept her rebuttal cool, in\ncontrol.\n“She shouldn’t join,” Jasnah said, “because you—both Taravangian and\nOdium—are a tyrant, a destroyer, and a monster. You have murdered\nthousands, and by joining with you and your empire, any monarch becomes\ncomplicit in the damage you have done—and will do.”\n“I’ve done it in the service of the greatest good,” Taravangian said.\nHe hoped to use Jasnah’s personal values against her. Well, it would be\nbest not to underestimate the creature with near-deific powers, so she was\ncareful and precise as she replied. “I do not accept that you have done good,\nTaravangian. Your murders in Jah Keved were in the service of putting\nyourself on the throne—something you might argue is the greater good.\nHowever, there were obviously better ways than murder of achieving\nstability in the kingdom.”\n“And stability on Roshar, Jasnah?” Taravangian asked. “I can see the\npermutations of time. How many billions of people—slated for death—will\nlive because I stepped up to take this mantle? When I have control of the\ncosmere, the peace that shall be known will bring joy to more people than\nyou can imagine exist.”\n“Is peace your only ‘good’?” Jasnah asked. “Because freedom and\nvolition are enormous goods unto themselves—and being protected from\nharm, yet being dominated without the chance to speak or fight for yourself,\nis not a true good. Shall we speak of the writings of Falabratant, of your\nown home city, and his moral philosophies regarding self-determination?\nWe could write to him now and see what he says.”\n“He would not answer,” Taravangian said softly."

It was strange\nhe’d managed to keep even spies from communicating, but that city was\nfully in his power. She’d guessed that he’d done something to stop\nspanreeds from working in the city, as had previously happened at Kholinar.\n“Yes,” Taravangian said. “I have.” Taravangian fell silent, eyeing her. He\nplainly understood Jasnah’s tactic—getting into the weeds of nuanced\nphilosophical discourse would lose Fen. She was intelligent and discerning,\nbut in Jasnah’s experience, one of the fastest ways to kick someone out of a\nconversation was to bombard them with minutiae about a topic they had not\nresearched.\n“But this,” Taravangian said, “is a tangent.”\n“Then it is one which is specifically relevant to the situation,” Jasnah\nreplied.\n“No,” Taravangian said. “Fen can’t know, as you can’t know, the things\nmy divine eyes can see. I insist my rule will be the better good, but anything\nI showed you would be tainted by my touch. You will never believe that I\nam right.”\nA point to Jasnah. By admitting that, by refusing to argue further, he\nacknowledged as much.\n“Then,” Jasnah said, “if joining you isn’t for the greater good, why\nshould she join you?”\n“Because she would get a better deal with me.”\n“And what of her sense of honor?” Jasnah asked, knowing how relevant\nthe idea was to Fen. “She has made promises to our coalition. Joining you\nwould be to turn her back on her allies.”\n“Allies,” he said. “For how long? Two years now?”\n“These two years haven’t been without their problems, but we have been\na good team.” Jasnah looked across at Fen. “Alethkar, Thaylenah, Azir. We\nhave done well together—better than we ever did apart. This is the start of\nsomething valuable, Fen.”\n“That is true,” Fen said. “Isn’t it?” She looked to Taravangian, nodding.\n“All of your arguments are abstract—when I have at my side an ally who\nhas proven themselves. I face you, an ally who betrayed us. So\nTaravangian, with all this talking in circles, you have proved nothing.”\n“Nothing?” he said. “Fen, your grand coalition will fall eventually. You\nknow Alethkar cannot keep its word long-term. What of Dalinar’s attempts\nto become highking? What about the secrets they kept from you? What\nabout how consistently Alethkar acted without informing or involving\nyou?”\n“Mistakes,” Jasnah said. “Which we admitted. We have done better in\neach instance.”\n“Yes,” Fen said. “Dalinar is a bully at times—but I know where I stand\nwith him, and he is doing better.”\nTaravangian drew his lips to a line and eyed Jasnah. Seeming displeased."

Forever. I\noffer you, right now, the chance to negotiate. Isn’t it at least tempting to see\nwhat you can negotiate out of me? For yourself?”\n“I think I’m fine where I am, Taravangian,” she said. “If you’re finished,\nI believe I’ve made my decision.”\n“Have you asked Jasnah what she’d do in your situation?” he asked\nsoftly.\nJasnah frowned. “I’d obviously not side with you. I don’t understand\nwhy you keep bringing this up …”\nShe trailed off, because Taravangian’s smile had returned.\nThat unnerved her.\n“I’ll ask it,” he said. “Jasnah, what would you do if you were in Fen’s\nsituation?”\n“Keep my promises,” she said.\n“Is that so?” he asked. “You would do the moral thing instead of the\nright thing? Tell me, historian, do you avoid distasteful choices because\nthey are difficult? Do you search for the non-violent solution, or do you act\ndecisively to protect your own? To do the greatest good as you see it,\nregardless of the cost.”\nShe hesitated. Wait. But she’d won that point, hadn’t she? He was\nobviously trying to turn the focus from himself to her—undermining her\nvalue as a credible …\nOh no. Looking at his smile, she felt a coldness move through her. He\ncouldn’t know about …\n“Jasnah,” he said, “shall we speak of it?”\n“It?”\n“The lesson,” he whispered. “The day you came into my city, took\nShallan, and went on the hunt for people to murder. The day you\ntransformed living, breathing men into statues and smoke in an alley?”\nJasnah felt cold—remembering that first day when she’d shown her\npowers to Shallan.\n“That day,” Taravangian said, “when you murdered people on the streets\nof my city, you let your true allegiance—to Odium—be known.”\n“What is this?” Fen asked, looking to Jasnah, whose insides were turning\ninto knots. “What is he talking about?”\n“Jasnah,” Taravangian said, sitting calmly, meeting Jasnah’s eyes, “once\nwalked around in my city at night, displaying her wealth, hoping that men\nwould try to rob her. Like a fisherman with a lure, to attract thieves so that\nshe could kill them.”\n“A lesson for my ward,” Jasnah said. “About making difficult choices.”\n“You said earlier,” Taravangian continued, “that your moral philosophy\nled you to do the most good.

Tell her to do what you’d do.”\n“I would obviously …” She trailed off again, sensing that there was\nmore to come. He had another blow to deliver.\nIndeed, Taravangian patted at his robes, then reached into one pocket and\ntook out a piece of paper. He unfolded it carefully, then presented it to Fen.\nJasnah, feeling a mounting dread, rose and stepped over to look: and saw\nFen held a contract for assassination. One targeting Aesudan—Elhokar’s\nwife, and Jasnah’s sister-in-law. It was signed by Jasnah herself.\nDamnation. While she’d come prepared to argue against philosophies,\nTaravangian had come to argue against a person.\nHer.\nAs Navani walked through Urithiru, she held Gav, who was—despite being\nsmall for his age—a little too big to carry gracefully. He immediately fell\nasleep, his little body giving up and letting him slumber.\nShe didn’t set him down as they rode the lift all the way to the top. Her\nmind was on Dalinar, whom she’d abandoned. Logically, she still agreed\nwith all of her reasons for leaving. Protecting Gav. Making certain one\nBondsmith escaped. If Dalinar couldn’t go to the contest of champions …\nStorms. She’d go. She’d already decided that, hadn’t she? This wouldn’t\nbe a fight with swords. Whatever it was, if Dalinar couldn’t go … she\nwould.\nBut even that was not something she could focus on. She had heard\nDalinar describe this emotion before, this heightened intensity. You leave a\nman behind on the battlefield, and something changes in you. Her every\nthought was on how she could get him out. If she relaxed, it would be a\nbetrayal. It didn’t make sense, but it felt like sense.\nShe drew a strange spren, like swaths of light in the air following an\ninvisible shining object. One she’d never seen before. She reached the top,\nwhere Mararin the nursemaid—brought by her request to the Sibling—\nwaited to take Gav. Navani nervously let him go, but fortunately he was fast\nasleep. Navani gave instructions to put him on a couch in the room next\ndoor, where she could check on him. Then she strode toward her meeting\nroom, surprising the guards out front—who immediately drew swords on\nher.\nTold you, the Sibling said.\nNavani glared at the guards. A long, uncomfortable moment. Then …\nthey slowly lowered their weapons. “Storms,” one said. “You’re the real\none, aren’t you?”\n“Let me see,” Navani said, brushing past and entering the little chamber\nbeyond.

I thought you\nsaid they couldn’t use their abilities while—\nLook closer, the Sibling said. And they sounded … amused?\nThe other Navani was halfway through a meal. Men’s food—spiced\nmashed glibon beans, cured pork, flatbread. The doppelganger’s hands were\nsticky with sauce, her head close to the table, arm lifted as she attempted to\nshove an entire piece of flatbread into her mouth. Her eyes opened wide as\nshe saw Navani, and she froze there, juice dripping off the bread and onto\nher cheek.\n“Lift?” Navani guessed.\n“Told you,” the younger guard whispered to his companion from behind.\n“Brightness Navani would never spend so much time staring at my ass …”\n“Oh, flaps!” Lift said. “Seventeen bakers and one whore! Uh … I mean\n… uh, hi, Navani! Um … I did a real good job a bein’ you …”\nIt was surreal seeing herself quickly wipe her hands and scramble over—\nhitting her elbow on the desk, then cursing and kicking it, then cursing and\nhopping on one foot from the pain.\n“This was Wit’s idea?” Navani said flatly.\nLift-Navani wiped her hands on her fine havah, making real-Navani\nwince. “He thought it would … um … stop people from panicking?”\n“He thought it would be funny too, admittedly,” Wit’s voice said from\nbehind.\nNavani spun, and found Dalinar with a distinctly Wit-ish twinkle in his\neye.\n“In my defense,” Wit said, the illusion evaporating, “I mostly required\nher to stay in bed complaining of an illness. I told our leaders the truth. We\nparaded her back and forth through the hallways to keep the tower calm.”\n“She didn’t moon anyone, did she?” Navani asked.\n“Hey!” Lift said, scowling. “I’m not that bad.”\nThe girl was getting more sensitive about jokes. Well, Navani\nremembered that age, and being the same way. She tried to apply that\nunderstanding to Lift, but storms … she felt like she was going to spend\nyears hearing about the embarrassing things “she” had done this week.\nHer worry for Dalinar, however, washed away such concerns. She took\nWit by the arm. “I left him,” she said, tears finally forming in her eyes. “I\nhad … I had to leave him. And—”\n“It’s all right,” Wit said. “Calm yourself.”\n“I don’t need calm, Wit,” she snapped. “I need focus. You helped us into\nthis mess, and you will help me save him.”\n“Of course,” Wit said. “First, did Shallan, Gav, Rlain, or Renarin return\nwith you?”\n“Shallan?” she said. “I have Gav. But Rlain? Renarin? I didn’t know\nthey were even in there.”"

        "text": "top of his cane as he sat, “would you have assassins watch your own family,\nJasnah?”\n“Aesudan was unpredictable,” Jasnah explained, turning toward him\nfrom where she stood by Fen. “And power hungry. I worried about her\ndestabilizing the kingdom.”\n“Ah,” Taravangian said. “But didn’t you condemn me for killing to\nobtain the throne of Jah Keved? Didn’t you insist there were ‘obviously\nbetter ways than murder’? Are you a hypocrite, Jasnah?”\nDamnation.\nHe was good.\nHe’d led her right into a trap, let her think she was doing well, before\nslamming a revelation into her head like a warhammer. Was this what it was\nlike to argue with someone who could foresee the future?\n“Did you go to Aesudan and try to get her to change?” Taravangian\nasked. “Or did you talk to your brother, who loved her? No. I know you\ndidn’t. Why not?”\n“Contract notwithstanding, I never moved against Aesudan, Fen,” Jasnah\nsaid, her mind racing as she tried to find a way to control this development.\n“I had the option, but all I did was watch her to be certain.”\n“You were willing to murder a member of your own family,”\nTaravangian said. “In secret. You knew then, as you now know, that pain\nand suffering are sometimes required. You speak of freedom and liberty, but\nyou connive and plot to force your goals upon the world. Because you\nrecognized the job of the monarch is to protect their people. No matter\nwhat.”\nJasnah looked across at him, meeting his eyes. He couldn’t know …\n“Did you ever explore the possibility,” Taravangian asked, “of\nassassinating Fen?”\nDamnation.\nFen—holding the contract at Jasnah’s side—stared at her with obvious\nconcern. Lying now would only make it worse. He could have re-created\nthose paper trails as well.\n“I investigated every monarch with whom we interacted,” Jasnah\nadmitted. “And assessed their likelihood of being a threat to my people.”\n“Did you ever ‘explore the possibility of assassinating’ me, Jasnah?” Fen\nasked.\n“I …” Jasnah said. “I am known to overprepare at times. I need to know\nmy options.”\nAgain Taravangian smiled. Choose your words more carefully, Jasnah\nthought to herself in annoyance. Don’t let him rile you into speaking hastily.\n“Options?” Fen said. “Killing me was an option?”\n“It was before I knew you,” Jasnah said, slowing, being more deliberate\nwith her diction. “Please understand. I was exploring a hypothetical. Surely,\nas a queen, you …”\nStorms. He wanted her to admit that a monarch had to protect her people\n—leading toward the inevitable conclusion that joining his coalition would\nbe better for Thaylenah. Jasnah took a deep breath, and steered the\nconversation back toward Taravangian. “He’s trying to turn us against one\nanother, Fen. Look at his smile.”\n“I smile,” Taravangian said, “because I do not wish to let myself despair\nat the harsh realities of the world. A good monarch does as you did, Jasnah."

A good monarch does as you did, Jasnah.\nAnyone, including a friend, can become a liability. A good monarch\nprepares to do even what is painful. Tell me honestly. If you, right now,\nthought Fen were a threat to your family—if she were planning to destroy\nAlethkar—would you eliminate her?”\n“Any queen would,” Jasnah said.\n“I don’t … know if I would,” Fen whispered.\nJasnah froze, standing at the center of their little triangle of three chairs,\nthen looked at the other queen.\n“Oh, I’d bluster,” Fen said. “I’d scream and I’d be angry. But\nassassinating a friend …” The paper went limp in her fingers. “I’ve always\nworried I’m too soft for this job.”\nThis was unexpected; Jasnah would not have anticipated that from Fen.\nTaravangian had prepared well. He somehow knew the queen better than\nJasnah did.\n“It’s all right, Fen,” Taravangian said. “You have a model before you.\nJasnah—who, despite her words to the contrary, doesn’t actually seek the\ngreater good.” Taravangian faced her. “Admit it, Jasnah. You only seek your\ngreater good. You protect your kingdom, and your people, above others.\nYour philosophy is deeply flawed, for you cannot know what is best for all.\nA mortal cannot think of Roshar at large—let alone the cosmere. Have you\nimagined how many planets there are, how many people? Would you let\nRoshar be destroyed to protect them?”\nShe …\nStorms. Her mind reeled. The grand scope of the cosmere, and the\nbillions who lived in it, was indeed too much.\nDon’t let him steer, she thought. Don’t let him catch you with corner\ncases.\n“I could never know,” Jasnah said, “that destroying a planet was for the\nbest—and so no, I wouldn’t.”\n“If you can’t know the greater good,” Taravangian said, “why would you\nprofess to try to seek it?”\nShe almost followed with the next logical sentence: that it was her duty\nto do her best to seek the greater good. A person could only see so far, and\nhad to act on their best information. If she said that, he’d point out that he\nhad more information—seeing into the future as a pseudo-deity did. She\nwouldn’t fall into that trap.\nShe closed her mouth. He noticed, and nodded slightly to her in\nacknowledgment.\n“I don’t like how this is going, Jasnah,” Ivory said in her ear. “I …\nworry.”\n“This does not change the situation,” Jasnah said, meeting Taravangian’s\neyes. “Fen knows that you double-crossed us, and set us up for destruction.\nShe might question my morality, but why does that matter? You are the one\nshe would be making a deal with. Your history of behavior is far more\nimportant.”\n“Well, that’s true, at least,” Fen said, lowering the contract.\nAnother nod, almost imperceptible, from Taravangian—in recognition of\nher skillful turning of the conversation."

And if we are considering history, the\nsingers have always been a multiracial society, willing to accept humans\namong them. And while we speak of the Voidbringers and their destruction\n—only the humans, in recent history, have accomplished something truly\nbarbarous: the near extinction of the singers. A union between you and my\nempire is perfectly workable, and my goal isn’t to prove myself moral, but\nto show that your correct choice—your sole reasonable choice—is to take\nthe deal I’m offering.”\n“And you are failing at proving that goal,” Jasnah said. “Fen doesn’t care\nabout the fate of the cosmere—but she does care about the fate of Roshar.\nWhat kinds of policies will you implement, Taravangian? What kind of god\nwill you be? You’ve told Dalinar that you intend to launch invasions of\nother worlds. Will you simply turn Thaylenah into a mill churning out\nsoldiers to die in your thirst for conquest?”\nJasnah caught the briefest glance of annoyance from him. “I would be\nwilling,” he said, seeming reluctant, “to exempt the Thaylen people from\nconscription, allowing them to join up only if they wish it.”\n“You’d need to promise more than that,” Fen said. “I know how you can\nget ‘volunteers’ by creating hardships for those who don’t sign up. We’d\nneed protections in place against that.”\n“Of course,” Taravangian said.\nJasnah gritted her teeth. Don’t let negotiations start. That was yet\nanother wrong turn. He was more than good at this. He was fantastic, and\nJasnah …\nJasnah found herself invigorated. She rebelled against the emotion; she\nwas striving to defend the fate of an entire people. This was a solemn,\nterrifying situation.\nShe didn’t enjoy this, but a part of her was engaged in a way she had\nrarely been in her life. Arguing with someone who had the genuine capacity\nto not merely match her every point, but defeat her. It made her feel alert,\neven alive.\n“It doesn’t matter,” Jasnah said to him, “because the destruction and pain\nyou will cause Roshar will be legendary should you win. Sometimes, yes,\npain and suffering are needed—which is why we continue to fight you.\nSiding with you would be a betrayal of Roshar itself.”\n“Jasnah,” he said, “every war on this planet has been caused by the\nconflict between two Shards. Two religions. Now that there is only one\nShard, one god, we have found a way to peace—with your uncle’s contest.\nIt’s time to look forward, not backward. By siding with me, Fen can reap\nthe greatest benefits of the new world we’re creating.”\n“I don’t know, Taravangian,” Fen said. “She’s right.

Fen, if you join with\nme, I will end religious strife forever, across the cosmere. Think of being\nthe one to help bring peace to untold millions.”\n“Again,” Jasnah said, “this is a scope beyond our ability to consider.\nYou’ve proven that.”\n“Admit it, Jasnah,” he said. “Doesn’t this appeal to you? A crusade to put\na stop to religious strife? The chance to kill the remaining gods, leaving you\nonly one to deal with? Isn’t that the core of who you are?”\n“No,” she said, feeling her strength mount.\n“But you have always said—”\n“My core,” she said, “is rationality. It is not hatred. I am not defined by\nmy heresy, no matter how much people have tried to do so.”\nTaravangian hesitated, studying her.\n“It’s an easy mistake to make,” Jasnah continued. “My goal is nothing\nmore than the freedom of mind, body, and will for all. Let them worship\nhow they wish, but let them do so with their eyes open, having all the\nrelevant information.”\n“And the gods who subject people to their demands?”\n“I would have issues with them, as I do with you,” Jasnah said. “But I do\nnot know them—and I am not a child, Taravangian. I do not assume that\nwithout religion, there would be nothing for people to go to war over.\n“If you assume I will crusade against religion or other Shards simply\nbecause they exist, then you make a mistake. The same mistake made by all\nwho give petty, casual thought to my heresy. They assume I replace\nreligious ideology with an ideology of their absence. That is not the case. I\nam against dogma of any variety. God, nationality, or philosophy—when\nyou become a slave to it without capacity to change or reconsider, that is the\nproblem.”\n“But you have said in the past—”\n“When new information arrives,” Jasnah said, “I change. If I find\noppression in the cosmere, I will oppose it. However, to join you in war\nagainst other planets would only perpetuate suffering.” She took a deep\nbreath, everything locking into place. “I will not side with you. I am not\nyou.”\n“Of course not,” he said. “You don’t see far enough. If you did, you’d\nunderstand completely. The greatest good.”\n“You are not good for this planet. Your history, temperament, and\nmorality all prove it. It will require sacrifices to stand against you, but we\nwill do so, united. Regardless of the cost.”\nHe nodded to her a third time. “I appreciate it, Jasnah,” he said. “You are\nremarkable.

Just as she’d sacrifice all those worlds in the cosmere to\nprotect Roshar. Just as she’d kill you to protect her family. Ultimately she’s\nlike any of us: Family. Kingdom. World. In that order.”\n“I—” Jasnah started, not wanting to let him talk.\n“Would you deny it?” Taravangian said, his soft, kindly voice cutting\nthrough her objection. “Would you deny that you’d throw away Thaylenah\nto destroy me, but that you would not do the same with Alethkar? If you\nwere able to save your land, but condemn the other, what would you do?”\nWhat would she do? It deserved thought, and she knew—with a little of\nit—that she’d do as he said.

She had a special duty to protect her people,\nbecause she was their queen.\n“The individual details of a situation would be too intricate for me to\nanswer a question like that,” Jasnah said. “So I say, without further context,\nthat I wouldn’t destroy Thaylenah.”\nFen was eyeing her. Storms, Jasnah was being too academic about this.\nFor all Fen’s limitations as a queen at times, she was incredibly emotionally\nintelligent. She was probably reading too much into the way Jasnah paused.\n“By the first winds,” Fen said. “That’s a lie, isn’t it, Jasnah? You would\nsacrifice Thaylenah to defeat him. Of course you would.”\n“I’d strive to do what is right,” Jasnah said. “But Fen, he’s deflecting us\nwith abstractions.”\n“Actually, they’re quite concrete,” Taravangian said. He stood up to face\nher. “We know what you and the Alethi would do in such a situation. You\nalready encountered one. When Dalinar made his contract, what thought\ndid he give to Thaylenah?”\n“He froze all—”\n“He didn’t even think about them,” Taravangian said. “I can see that\nmoment, Jasnah! He gave a plea for Herdaz to save face because of a\npromise, but he forgot the rest. He could have frozen the national lines\nimmediately, but he didn’t. Why? Because he was thinking of Alethkar\nalone, which was already captured. What thought did he give for the rest?\nNone. As you, in a similar situation, would consider only you and yours.”\n“Nonsense,” Jasnah said. “I’d think of the greater good.”\n“How can you know, though?” Fen demanded, standing too. “How can"

You’re just like Dalinar, aren’t you? So\ndetermined to decide.”\n“Fen, no,” Jasnah said. “Listen—”\nJasnah’s own voice cut in. “What if we renegotiated the contract?”\nShe froze. So did Fen. They looked to Taravangian, who held up his\nhand, a small Lightweaving appearing above it. Showing the group of them\n—Jasnah, Fen, Wit, Dalinar, Navani—sitting in a room full of plants,\nmeeting last week. Jasnah had spoken, and in his simulacrum, she did\nagain.\n“If there is a new Odium,” the image of Jasnah said, “he might agree to\ndifferent terms. Perhaps he will stop the war entirely if we give him\naccommodations. What if we let him leave?”\n“Jasnah,” Wit said, pained. “We can’t unleash him upon the cosmere.”\nTaravangian met her eyes.\nAnd Jasnah, in that moment, knew she had lost.\n“Sometimes,” the Jasnah hovering over his hand said, “you have to think\nabout yourself first.”\n“What is best for Thaylenah, Jasnah?” Taravangian whispered.\nFen turned toward her. “He is right. If you wanted to do what was best\nfor Thaylenah, what would you do? A monarch must be willing to sacrifice\nanything to protect their people. Isn’t that right?”\nJasnah took a deep breath, trying to clear her mind, claw this\nconversation back. She had the philosophical grounding to resist this. “Fen,\nlisten. He’s set up a classic prisoner’s dilemma for us. It’s a conversation we\nhave all the time in philosophical circles; it may seem that the best thing to\ndo is sell out the others, but if we remain united—”\n“Sometimes,” the small Jasnah repeated, “you have to think about\nyourself first.”\n“But—”\n“Sometimes”—louder, her own voice condemning her—“you have to\nthink about yourself first.”\n“You’ve always tried to have it both ways, Jasnah,” Taravangian\nwhispered. “Protect your own. Then do what is right. In that order.” He\nlooked to Fen. “I will give nearly anything to see her defeated, Fen.\nIncluding the greatest deal any kingdom or planet will ever get from me.\nThaylenah will become a genuine world power, not subject to Alethkar.\nEver. Again.”\n“I—” Jasnah said.\n“Tell me I’m wrong,” he said, focusing on her. “Deny that you seek your\nown country’s needs first. Lie for us, Jasnah. Look me in the eyes, and lie.”\nStorms. She needed support, and turned to her ideals. But they wavered.\nAnd … and … the truth was, he did offer an excellent opportunity for\nThaylenah. It truly would protect Fen’s people best, and make them rich.\nThey’d have free trade within Odium’s empire, they would be protected\nfrom any future Alethi aggression, and they would benefit—like any"

Grand conquests brought lavish wealth to those\nback home. Aligning with Odium would bring Fen’s people stability and\nprosperity. It might not be the greater good, but Jasnah’s core rocked as she\nacknowledged—finally—that she really couldn’t see the greater good.\nAnd never had been able to.\nNo, a part of her thought. Freedom is more important.\nBut did she believe that? Or did she believe that keeping people safe was\nright, regardless? Even if Dalinar won this war … Fen’s people were\nheaded for debilitating austerity. Jasnah had been willing to kill Aesudan …\nand had killed those men in Kharbranth. Did she still think those choices\nwere right?\nIt all became a mess in her head.\nAs he had obviously intended.\n“Jasnah,” Fen said, “I know you’d take the deal. He’s been correct all\nalong.”\n“No, I wouldn’t,” Jasnah snapped.\nAnd … those words were a lie. It was what she wanted Fen to do, not\nwhat she would do. It wasn’t best for Thaylenah—but it might be best for\nAlethkar.\nOh …\nOh, storms. When the moment came, she did exactly as he said she\nwould. She did whatever it took to win.\n“He’s right,” Fen whispered. “You lie.”\nJasnah trembled, and inwardly marveled at what Taravangian had done.\nHe’d made her stay up all night, preparing political arguments so she now\nbuzzed with exhaustionspren. Then he’d cornered her and besmirched her\ncharacter and turned her very moral framework against her. He had come\narmed not merely with politics, but with the truth.\n“I’ll take the deal, Taravangian,” Fen said. “Assuming we can reach\npoints I agree with.”\nJasnah barely heard it. He’s right about me, she thought, horrified—\nseeing the near assassination of Aesudan … the lesson in Kharbranth … the\nway she’d stood with a sword to Renarin’s neck—all those moments in a\nnew light.\nI didn’t swing, she thought. I didn’t kill him, or Aesudan. But that proved\nTaravangian correct. She’d loved them too much to kill them, which meant\nher moral philosophy was an utter sham. Jasnah Kholin loved her family,\nher people, her kingdom.\nAnd that, in this instant, condemned her.\nIt suddenly seemed that she’d always been two women. One who\npretended to be cold, calculating, and willing to do anything in the name of\nher philosophical morality. Another who knew that there had always been\nsomething wrong with the morals she claimed to follow.\nShe couldn’t know what was right.\nThe cosmere, even the world, was just too big.\nShe … she needed time to deal with this.\nSo she sat down again, and the negotiations began.

In so doing, Thaylenah joined the enemy without a\nsingle sword being raised.\nNINE YEARS AGO\nOnce again, Szeth sat while others decided his fate.\nTonight he did it by a fire, arms crossed on his knees, cheeks stained\nwith tears. His army camped a short distance away. The Stoneward army\nhad retreated to its fortifications. All the others camped around him, and\ntheir Honorbearers stood with his father nearby.\nAt least Szeth had finally become a threat that was worthy of attention.\nHis father …\nHis father carried an Honorblade now.\nNeturo had become one who subtracted.\nIt was silly to let this bother Szeth. Neturo had become a soldier the\nmoment he’d joined up, and he’d trained with the sword like everyone else.\nIt was just that … he’d become an administrator so quickly, and Szeth had\ntrouble picturing him as a killer. Yet the Bondsmith Blade was said to be the\nmost destructive of them all. When the time came, the others would kill\nhundreds, and the Bondsmith tens of thousands …\nHis gentle father. A killer. Szeth closed his eyes, hugging his knees, and\nlistened.\n“The Voice wanted this to continue,” Sivi said. “Surely that makes you\nwary, Pozen.”\n“We almost had war,” Moss said. “Straight-up civil war.”\n“What is his real game?” Sivi asked. “He could have stopped this at any\npoint, but he didn’t. He let Szeth continue building momentum. If those\nsoldiers hadn’t listened to Neturo …”\n“My son gets confused sometimes,” Neturo said. “But he’s a good lad,\nwith a heart stronger than any of us. I still don’t understand why I couldn’t\ntalk to him about these plans. I’ll need a better reason than God gave last\nweek, that’s for sure.”\nHe sounded … he sounded like he’d been part of this for a great long\ntime. He’d known for years?\nBut known what?\nHello, Szeth, the Voice said in his mind.\nSzeth jumped. “Get out of my head,” he hissed.\nNo. Regardless of your tantrums, here we are, and you have proven to\nhave no more backbone than your predecessor. I genuinely thought you’d\nstrike Neturo down and start a revolution.\n“My father?” Szeth said, pained. “You thought I’d kill my own father?”\nYes. The gods did it once. You seem of a similar air. Regardless, I’m\ngoing to have to do something to harden you. This land needs armies if we\nare to fight, and armies need generals who are actually acquainted with\nwar.\n“I don’t understand. And I don’t want to understand.”\nYou don’t need to, fortunately. Simply do as you are told. If you do not\ntrust me, trust your father. Goodbye, Szeth. I’ll see you in a decade.\nThe Voice vanished. Szeth huddled down, and suddenly wondered if\nhe’d somehow dreamed all of it. The others said they heard the Voice, but\nwas he only imagining that they said those things? What if he couldn’t be\ntrusted at all, in any way, to make his own decisions? What then?"

What then?\n“Truthless,” Pozen said.\nSzeth caught the word. Truthless.\n“There has to be another way,” Neturo said. “Truthless … that’s harsh,\nPozen. Too harsh.”\n“It is the right decision,” Pozen said. “He will learn humility in that\nstation. And Neturo, he will be a threat to no one. Isn’t that what you\nwant?”\n“He must pay,” Vambra agreed. “If we don’t punish civil war, then what\nwill we punish?”\n“I suggest,” Gearil the Dustbringer said, “we declare here and now that\nthe Voidbringers are never going to return. We need to push Truth to mean\nsomething else, something new, or we will have further problems like this.”\n“Agreed,” Dulo the Edgedancer said. “And we must make an example of\nthis man. He’s Truthless. If we don’t declare it, we will face other\nrebellions.”\n“He’s just …” Neturo said. “He’s just confused …”\n“Neturo,” Sivi said, her voice gentle, “you’ve known Truth since the day\nI let you touch the Bondsmith Blade. You saw the stones transform; you’ve\nseen the future; you spoke to God. You know what is coming.”\n“You know there are no Voidbringers,” Pozen said. “The spirits of the\nstones themselves showed it to you. The former powers are no more. The\nKnights Radiant are fallen. We are all that remains, and we must focus on\nthe true threat.”\n“War,” Neturo whispered. “With other worlds.” His voice sounded\nstronger, and he joined the others as they strode back to the fire. Neturo\ntook a deep breath. “Give up the sword, Szeth.”\nIn response, still seated, Szeth summoned it. He understood little of their\nconversation, and his mind was foggy, confused. Dazed. Yet …\nNo Voidbringers.\nThere were no Voidbringers?\nNo more Knights Radiant?\nThe spirits of the stones themselves promised it?\nThis Blade was the ultimate manifestation of his sin. He tossed it to the\ngrass. Stones Unhallowed … he’d killed so many … He thought he heard\nthe dead whispering in the night around him.\nPozen nodded, and a few soldiers took Szeth from behind, forcing him\nup to his knees, binding his wrists. As he struggled, his father put a hand on\nhis shoulder, calming him.\n“He gave up the Blade willingly,” Neturo said. “He allowed himself to\nbe bound. There’s no need for harsh punishment.”\nSzeth looked at the sky. That beautiful black infinity, broken by stars. He\nclosed his eyes, ignoring the pain in his shoulder from having his hands\ntied. He felt the wind. There as always.\n“They are correct, Father,” Szeth whispered. “I am Truthless. I must be.”\n“Son?” Neturo asked.\n“There are two options,” Szeth whispered. “Either I was right to attack\nyou all, or I was wrong. If I am right, then I need to kill all of you here.\nEven you, Father.” Tears stained Szeth’s eyes as he gazed upward."

One or the other. Decide. For I will not.”\nSilence, other than the teasing wind.\nHe never could trust in his own opinion, could he?\n“So be it,” Neturo said softly.\nSzeth closed his eyes. “What is the punishment for being Truthless?”\n“An Oathstone,” Sivi said. “Banishment.”\n“You will swear it?” Pozen asked. “To follow the way of the\nOathstone?”\nA stone. A stone would know better than he did, wouldn’t it? That would\nbe … so, so very nice.\n“I don’t want to decide anymore,” Szeth whispered. “I’m done. Give me\nthe stone.”\nPozen reached into his pocket and brought out a small round rock. A\nsimple one with a few quartz crystals and a rusty vein of iron on one side.\nHe raised it up. “Before this Oathstone, before the spren, before your father.\nPromise to do whatever this stone’s holder demands of you, except the\ndemand to kill yourself.”\n“I make the Oathstone promise,” Szeth said. “I will follow what is said\nby the one who holds it, as you say.” He felt an immediate liberation at\nsaying the words. No more choices.\nFreedom.\nThey cut his bonds, and he stood, holding out his hand for the stone.\n“Take his Blade,” Pozen said, waving. “Until we can …”\nHe trailed off, then looked toward the sky. They all did, even his father.\n“What?” Szeth asked.\n“The Voice says …” Sivi whispered, standing just to Szeth’s right. “He\nsays you’re to keep it.”\n“A Truthless with an Honorblade?” Father said. “That sounds incredibly\ndangerous.”\nThey all paused again, and shivered from whatever the Voice said. His\nfather cursed and glanced at Szeth, then away, squeezing his eyes shut.\n“He will be sent East,” Pozen said, pressing the Oathstone into Szeth’s\nhand. “We will give him to one of the Farmers to send off with a caravan. If\nGod says to leave him the Blade … Well, add this to your vow: you may\nnot give the Blade away. A stonewalker should never hold it.”\n“I promise it,” Szeth whispered.\n“Then may the stones guide you, Szeth-son-Neturo.”\n“I’m Truthless,” Szeth said. “I do not deserve that name any longer.”\n“Son,” Neturo said, turning back, weeping openly. “You’ll always\ndeserve it.”\n“I don’t decide that,” Szeth said, relaxing, loving that idea, “and neither\ndo you. We merely do what we are told.”\n“Szeth-son-son …” Pozen began.\n“Vallano,” Neturo said, wiping his eyes, though tears kept flowing.\n“Szeth-son-son-Vallano,” Pozen said, “for sins against Truth, you are\nbanished. And may the Heralds protect those you are turned against.”\nSzeth nodded."

I’m sorry.\nI’ve failed you. I’m so, so sorry … my little boy …”\n“Your little boy is dead, Neturo,” Szeth whispered. “You lost him years\nago, that night when he killed.”\nSoldiers pulled them apart, and left Neturo on the ground amid a patch of\ntrodden-down grass. They hauled Szeth away. He was eventually sold to a\nstonewalker with curious eyebrows and far too colorful clothing.\nFrom there, Szeth resolved not to look back.\nAnd never to question.\nNot every win is a victory. And not every loss is a defeat.\n—Proverbs for Towers and War, Zenaz, date unknown\nThe call came.\nFinally, Venli and the others launched toward the human forces. With\nthunder and red lightning as their accompaniment, a terrible chorus of\ndrums began. The pounding of greatshell feet on plateaus was the\npercussion, and the screams of terrified soldiers the applause.\nVenli clung to the slick ropes, mist and rain pelting her as Thundercloud\ncharged the human position. She felt a little of what humans must have\nduring those old plateau runs. Arrows sliced the air around her. Even with\nthe humans deliberately trying to miss her, even with a giant carapaced head\nin front to break arrows, it was unnerving.\nThey reached the chasm and leaped. She held her breath, her rhythms\nstilling.\nThude whooped as he stood upright, gripping the ropes, joyful like the\nold him. A heartbeat later, Thundercloud crashed through the human wall,\nbreaking the cracked fortification and shoving through the crumbling stone.\nThe humans had cleared off from this section, pretending that the cracks\nwere too extensive for them to risk standing atop it. Thundercloud entered\nthe plateau; it had taken considerable deliberate effort to explain to him that\nthey weren’t going to kill the humans. She felt his confusion now.\nWe don’t eat humans anymore, she sent to him.\nHis reply was more confusion. He knew that they didn’t eat humans\nanymore. He’d accepted all of the small things as rivals, and not food. But\nyou could eat things that weren’t usually food. And today, wasn’t he\nsupposed to?\nWell, all right, she thought to him, remembering the plan. We eat humans\nthis once. Only the correct humans.\nFor now, it was time to make a bit of a mess. She clung to his back with\nthe others, teeth gritted, attuned to Excitement to try to convince herself.\nThundercloud really leaned into his part—that of completely destroying the\nhuman camp while the two other chasmfiends crashed in behind. One\nripped down the gate between the two plateaus. They’d chosen Skyblue for\nthat, as she seemed to understand that she wasn’t to break the humans’\nbridge, which they’d use to flee onto the Oathgate platform."

Soon after, the Oathgate began to flash, people\nescaping. Overhead, Leshwi and her three made a good show of fighting.\nThundercloud snapped at a few retreating humans, and Venli reined him\nin with a rhythm. One waved, and dropped the package for her.\nThundercloud wanted to chase them, but she turned him the other direction.\nYou can’t eat those humans, she thought.\nHe sent back confusion again. His kind had made peace with the\nlisteners, who were like little chulls. But they could eat the humans\nsometimes, who were like little horses. He thought he’d figured it all out.\nShe pointed him toward a line of corpses that had been left—after some\ncomplaints—per her instruction. It made her extremely uncomfortable, but\nit did seem necessary. In seconds, Thundercloud was munching away. He\nsent to her that he thought he finally understood. She didn’t want him to eat\nhumans because they weren’t fatty enough to be truly delicious, and he\nshould focus on better meals.\nShe didn’t watch as the last humans retreated.\nShallan ducked through waves of possibility, dodging the eyes of the vast\nshadow that she knew must be Odium. Colors streamed around her like\nindividual rivers: versions of her rising from them like women bursting\nfrom a pool of water, then melting back down. Renarin and Rlain had\nmentioned being afraid of this place, but possibility didn’t frighten Shallan.\nShe engaged with it each time she drew.\nThe shadow hunted her, but she sent Lightweavings—effortless here—to\ndistract. Frightened versions of her in a dozen varieties—and it worked. In\nthis place, even a god had difficulty distinguishing the real her. Admittedly,\nhis attention seemed—most recently—diverted to something else. But she\nfelt a thrill.\nThe daughter of a Herald. Storms. Kelek had said she had a strange\nattachment to the Spiritual Realm, and had blamed her twin bonds. Was\nthere something more? She’d spoken to, held, her mother again. A\nrelationship fraught with pain and anxiety, and with old wounds made fresh.\nBut maybe … maybe they could heal this time without so much scarring.\nOdium’s attention finally left her entirely, the vast shadow in the sky\nvanishing. Was she right to read annoyance in that departure? She settled\ndown and let possibility wash over her, feeling … if not victorious, then\nsatisfied. She was certain he’d have found her—as he had before—if he’d\nbeen able to focus, but she’d at least given him a little trouble.\nNow what? She meditated on the colors, and acknowledged that too\nmuch time here—although it didn’t frighten her—would not be good for her\nmental health.

One of the off-color ones,\nwhere everything wasn’t quite right. She lay on a rocky beach at sunset. She\npicked herself up, brushing off, and turned, noting the placid ocean waves\nlapping toward her booted feet.\nShe spun slowly, inspecting mountainous terrain and a long beach. An\nisland. Maybe Thaylenah, on a side without the large city. Indeed, she\nthought she saw a village farther along. And some ships coming in for the\nevening, bearing the day’s harvest.\nShallan started toward a large set of rocks farther up the beach, intending\nto climb them for a better vantage. But as she drew close, she froze. Those\nweren’t rocks, but an enormous shelled carcass, mistaken for landscape in\nthe shadowed evening light.\nStorms. It was enormous—twenty-five feet tall on its side, with many\nlong legs like a crab, several broken. It was the largest greatshell she’d seen\nother than a chasmfiend, and it appeared distinctly proportioned for living\nin water, where buoyancy would allow such long legs. The natural historian\nin her wanted to imagine what its life was like, deep beneath the waves—\nand how it had eventually washed up here.\nShe wasn’t given the time for such scholarly diversions, however, as she\nnoticed something more daunting. Sitting on the beast’s shell, high up, with\none leg swinging over the side, was a single person.\nMraize.\nSigzil’s job was to make the retreat look like a rout.\nHe called for his soldiers to withdraw from Narak as the chasmfiends\nbroke down walls. He shouted and screamed, then fought desperately\nagainst enemy Heavenly Ones as his men made their retreat. He found one\nmoment to toss the pouch of rolled-up papers toward Venli, hoping the plan\nshe and he had hashed out was the right one, but mostly spent his time\norganizing his people.\nThe enemy forces—sensing victory—harried them but did not get lured\ninto a trap. Their leader was smart, that Fused with the silvery carapace. He\nstood on the wall as Sigzil mobilized the rearguard, including the Stormwall\nin his golden Shardplate.\n“I don’t like this,” the Stormwall growled softly. “I think we could have\nheld longer.”\n“Dami,” Sigzil hissed, “we are out of Stormlight.”\n“The Bondsmith said to stay,” Dami insisted from inside his helm. “The\nAlethi queen doesn’t override that. My loyalty isn’t to her, or her fallen\nkingdom.”\n“Is it to me?”\nThe Stormwall looked to him. “Yes,” he finally said. “Storm it, yes.

They hung before the sky of red\nlightning, but did not swing down. If they were lured onto the next plateau\nover, it would be disastrous for them. The Oathgate could transfer them to\nUrithiru.\n“Just tell me this,” the Stormwall said, saluting as a man in Shardplate\nclanked past, leading the surgeons in a hasty flight. No wounded; Sigzil had\nordered them to go earlier. “Promise me, Sigzil, that this is because it’s\nwhat you think is best. Not because you’ve lost a friend, and are too worried\nto keep fighting, lest you lose another.”\nStorms. That hit a bit close to home. But the Stormwall was known for\nhis accuracy. “I believe I’m doing this for the right reasons. I believe I’m\nlearning to lead, genuinely. But either way, it’s my call to make.”\nThe Stormwall grunted. “Appreciate the honesty.” He gazed back over\nNarak, which was now occupied by Venli’s chasmfiends. “This choice is\ngoing to bite us someday, Sigzil. Give my Stonewards fifteen minutes, then\nfollow.”\nSigzil saluted, then the Stormwall tromped off. His group was the last of\nthe ground soldiers, and would drop the bridge behind them, while the\nWindrunners made up the final rearguard. Capable as they were of swift\nmotion and flight, it was the natural strategy.\nBut it left Sigzil and his friends as the last fighters—and while Odium’s\nforces weren’t allowing themselves to be pulled into a trap, they were still\ntrying to do what damage they could. All but the listener Venli, and her\nchasmfiends—who put on a good show, then turned to eating corpses.\nSigzil whispered an apology to the souls of those whose bodies he’d\nallowed to be desecrated, then fought for fifteen minutes before signaling\nthe ultimate retreat. His Windrunners went flying for the Oathgate, and he\ncounted them off, then gave one last look at the Shattered Plains. He’d first\narrived here covered in crem and dust. Now he soared above it.

This\nstrange barren land that he’d bled for first as a slave, then as a bodyguard,\nthen finally as a Radiant.\nThis place had never been home. But home had been here. He saluted it,\nthen he turned to go.\nAnd immediately dropped from the sky.\nShockspren burst around him, and Vienta screamed in a panic in his ear.\nHe hit the plateau hard, with a crack of bones breaking, pain shooting\nthrough him.\nHow … What …?\nA figure in black touched down next to him, boots scraping stone. Sigzil\nhad landed on Narak Prime, off to one side near the wall. He blinked\nthrough tears up at a figure with glowing eyes, holding a fabrial in one\nhand.\n“They only have a few of these,” Moash whispered. “They are difficult\nto make, requiring rare spren.

The others\ndid so under protest—not because they wanted to use them, but because the\nFused fear this power.”\nSigzil’s fingers trembled from the pain of his fall—storms, that had been\nthirty feet or more. Healing didn’t come, and he couldn’t feel his body\nbelow the waist.\nThough moving was agony, Sigzil reached for his knife.\nMoash let him get it out, then stepped on his wrist, making him scream\nand drop it.\n“Sig …” Vienta said, her voice distant.\n“Go,” he whispered. “Get away.”\n“I can’t. I can’t leave you …”\nMoash, unable to hear her side of the conversation, knelt by Sigzil. “I\nhave a new god, Sig. He won’t take my pain—instead he lets me bathe in it,\nteaches me to love it. I’m going to build something great with him.\nUnfortunately, you’re in the way.”\nSigzil gritted his teeth against the pain. “Get,” he said between them to\nVienta, “help.”\nHis vision cleared, and he saw Moash smiling in the darkness, his\ncrystalline eyes and crown glowing with their own light. Contrasting with\nthe boiling red ocean of clouds above. Then Moash shot into the air and\nwhipped a knife from his belt, slashing with it as something flew overhead.\nSigzil felt Vienta’s pain as his own, though the anti-Stormlight knife had\nbarely nicked her. She became visible, dropping, a small figure in a puff of\nblue cloth who struck the ground near him, her arm completely destroyed\nand leaking Stormlight, her eyes wide as she trembled and gasped.\nMoash landed again, fabrial in one hand, light-bending knife in the other.\n“This will hurt me,” he said. “It is the pain of building a new empire.”\nHe raised the knife, ready to plunge it down. Leyten’s final words rang\nin Sigzil’s ears: the prophecy that Vienta and Sigzil would fall by Moash’s\nhand.\nBut the future was never set.\nAnd so, Sigzil did the only thing he could think of to save Vienta. “I\nrenounce my oaths!” he shouted.\nAnd he meant it.\nSomething ripped inside him, but he screamed it again, meaning every\nword as fervently as he could. “I renounce them!” Sigzil screamed against\nthe terrible pain. “I am no Radiant!”\nVienta shrieked in agony, but vanished as the knife hit the stone. Sigzil’s\nsoul suddenly echoed. For it was empty as a grand imperial hallway.\nMoash frowned, then stood. “That,” he said softly, “was exceptionally\nstupid of you.”\nHe stepped up to Sigzil, then paused as a Shardblade clanged to the\nground nearby. Vienta. Storms, Sigzil hoped Adolin’s Blade was right, and\nit was possible to heal deadeyes now. Sigzil rolled, grabbing the Blade, and\nswung it toward Moash—and narrowly missed the man’s legs as he hopped\nback, cursing."

Sigzil rolled, grabbing the Blade, and\nswung it toward Moash—and narrowly missed the man’s legs as he hopped\nback, cursing.\nSigzil propped himself up with one arm as best he could, sword in the\nother—his legs refusing to work. Moash eyed him, planning his next attack,\nand was so distracted that he didn’t see the figure come flying in from the\nside. Lopen slammed into Moash, throwing them both to the ground. Lopen\ncame up in a roll with the fabrial in one hand—then he shattered it against\nthe ground.\nSigzil’s powers didn’t return. However, the sudden pain of the lost bond\n—renounced along with his oaths—struck him like a thunderclap. An acute,\ncrippling grief, like a hole in his soul had been filled with fire.\nMoash stood and leveled his sword at Lopen. “You realize,” Moash said,\n“I’m more than capable of killing you without a fabrial, Lopen. I always\nbested you while sparring.”\n“Oh, I think you’ll have more trouble with me now,” Lopen said,\nsummoning his Shardspear.\n“What?” Moash asked. “Because you have two hands now?”\n“You storming idiot,” Lopen said, his expression dark but his grin wide\nas he leveled his spear. “It’s not the number of hands that makes a man, but\nthe number of cousins.”\nA flood of glowing shapes came in over the wall, led by Huio. Bridge\nFour. Skar, Peet, Natam … all of them. Moash assessed them with a glance,\nthen fled—soaring back toward the bulk of the enemy forces. Lopen took a\nstep after him, then apparently thought better of it.\nSkar landed by Sigzil and held out a sphere. “Here, sir. Take this.”\n“I can’t,” Sigzil croaked. He squeezed his eyes shut, tears leaking from\nthe corners.\n“Sure you can,” Skar said. “Unless … storms … did he …?”\nGentle hands took Sigzil’s Blade, then passed it to a squire, who winced\nat touching it. Lopen lifted Sigzil next, taking him into the air. “I saw what\nyou did, gancho. That was maybe the bravest thing I’ve ever seen a man\ndo.”\n“Not your gancho any longer,” Sigzil whispered. “Not a Windrunner any\nlonger. It’s up to you and Skar to lead now.”\n“Oh, storms,” Lopen whispered. “Almighty help us all …”\nA flash of light sent them through the Oathgate, and as soon as they\nappeared on the other side, he heard the orders to lock the mechanism so no\nenemies could follow. That would work, but would isolate and cut off the\nShattered Plains.\nAn Edgedancer came skating up to heal him. Though his body began\nworking again, Sigzil lay in a heap on the ground, staring at the Shardblade\nthey placed beside him.\nRelief never came. Painspren crawled all over him.

The other listeners seemed equally unnerved—all but Thude,\nwho was still laughing.\nVenli hummed to Resolve, then went on wobbling feet to retrieve the\npackage Sigzil had tossed for her. Just some papers rolled in an oiled cloth,\nwhich she tucked away for tomorrow. Narak was eerily empty now, barely\nrecognizable. Wet, crumpled buildings. Pools of rainwater, and little\nrainspren peeking up among the debris.\nFresh bodies left to make it appear like the assault had been more\neffective than it had actually been. She maintained Resolve, but secretly\nthought it looked obvious that the chasmfiends had attacked unpopulated\nsections. That the humans had evacuated willingly. That the retreat had been\ntoo quick.\nShe held her breath as El himself was carried onto the plateau by a\nHeavenly One. And Venli realized she still had no idea what brand of Fused\nhe was. What were his powers? She’d heard that he did the replacement of\nhis carapace himself, putting metal where there should be chitin, but any\nbrand of Fused could heal from such wounds.\nHe strolled through the camp, and eventually paused beside Venli and\nher crew. Leshwi and the others landed nearby. The Oathgate flashed again.\nSeconds later a Voidspren—like a line of glowing red light—crossed the\nground. “That is the last of them,” a familiar voice said. “I watched them\ngo. Vyre had some fun at the end, but it is done now. The Shattered Plains\nhave fallen to us at last.”\n“Your group did well,” El said, looking to Venli. “Retreat with your\npeople to the staging plateau. This might be a feint; the humans do like an\nunexpected rally. It is … something curious about them.”\nVenli nodded, but quietly sent a request to Thundercloud. He ambled\ntoward them, a human arm hanging from his mouth, and flopped down right\nthere and closed his eyes. The other two joined him, maws bloodied.\n“There’ll be no moving them now, Grand One,” Thude said. “They are\nburst predators—a lot of activity and feasting, followed by a good nap.”\n“I suppose we can watch this plateau from here, Ancient One,” Venli\nsaid to the Fused.\n“Very well,” El said, and moved on, speaking with his Fused\ncommanders and posting the majority of his forces near the Oathgate—he\nhad Vyre, the traitor, lock it down from their side, but seemed worried the\nhumans might somehow reverse that.\nHe was watching for the wrong kind of trap. Venli and the others\ngathered in a huddle, and none dared hum the rhythms they were feeling.\nExcept for Timbre, deep within her.\nOptimistic Joy.

When you fall, you could\nbreak something else.”\n“I don’t fall,” Adolin promised. “I catch myself while slipping and\nrecover.”\nThe surgeon eyed him, then shook his head. “Duelists,” he muttered,\nwaving for Adolin to sit down so he could check the stump. “Suppose you\ntrained fighting one-legged or some such?”\n“I did, in fact,” Adolin said with a chuckle. “Never know when you’ll\ntake a wound to the thigh. Zahel insisted.”\nThe surgeon undid the peg and checked Adolin’s stump—which\nadmittedly was pretty sore. He’d spent hours walking back and forth across\nthe courtyard today, receiving reports, listening to the fighting. Wincing at\neach and every shout. He had a sense he’d be called up, wounded or not,\nbefore the night ended, and wanted to be as steady as he could.\nThe surgeon put some ointment on the stump to dull the pain, and didn’t\norder bed rest. He kept glancing at the dome in the waning evening light.\nAnother runner came with a message for Adolin, Kushkam asking for some\nadvice about tactics—but there wasn’t much Adolin could say. The time for\ngrand strategy had passed—the defense of the dome was down to the field\ncommanders with simple instructions: hold the line.\n“I want you to rest this,” the surgeon said. “We might all have to take a\nturn tonight, and I know you’ll insist on going. Give it an hour or two first.\nPlease.”\nAdolin drew in a deep breath, then nodded. So it was that a few minutes\nlater, he found himself in another game of towers with Yanagawn. Using the\nfamiliarity of the game to try, for a short time at least, to get his mind off his\nworries. The emperor won their first bout. He had all the signs of becoming\nan excellent field general—just the right willingness to seize opportunities.\nNot timid, but also not brash. He learned from mistakes, and rarely had to\nbe taught the same principle twice.\nAdolin settled back, rubbing his stump—as he’d removed the peg for the\nmoment. He was coming to understand how lucky the Azish were. Out of\nthe hundreds of boys who could have been plucked from the street, how had\nthey—or really, Lift—found the one who would actually make a great\nleader?\nUnless … how many people who lived in the gutters would have\nexcelled if put in this seat?

He’d always assumed that\nthe Almighty had put him in that role deliberately. But if the Almighty was\ndead …\nThey reset the pieces. Tense, as another report came in. This was the last\nstand. All defenders on the lines, all reserves called up and fighting, no one\nbeing allowed to rest for more than fifteen-minute bursts. The next few\nhours would determine the fate of Azir for centuries to come. But here, two\nof the most powerful men in the world could do nothing but sit and wait.\nSo they played. Adolin’s sole attendants today were May Aladar and her\nscribes; he’d sent the rest of his guard to the battle lines. There wasn’t much\nuse for an archer at the moment. The fighting was all close quarters, so May\nhad taken up bodyguard duty. A position that a woman never should have\nhad to do, but these were unusual times.\nYanagawn was guarded by some of the finest in the Azish military.\nThese six soldiers probably wouldn’t have made much of a difference on\nthe battlefield, and Adolin didn’t suggest they be sent away, although in\nYanagawn’s position he would have done so immediately.\n“I feel like you legitimately tried that time,” Yanagawn said, “and I still\nwon!”\n“You did,” Adolin said. “Expertly done.”\n“You only pulled disadvantage cards though,” Yanagawn said. “That’s\nmore luck than anything, but still, this is the first match on an even field\nthat I won!”\n“You’re getting better and better,” Adolin said, thoughtful. Perhaps it\nwas time. “May, want to join us for a game?”\nShe looked up from her spanreed conversations. She was wearing her\nuniform just in case—a long mail shirt draped over the seat next to her, and\na set of leather greaves beside it. She eyed the game board in her analytical\nway. Then she nodded. He knew she played with her father—indeed, they’d\nhad a few games together during their days not-courting. She wasn’t bad.\nNot the best, but capable.\n“Sure,” she said. “Assuming you ask His Royal Majesty if it pleases\nhim.”\n“Tell her,” Yanagawn said, “I look forward to the opportunity. My first\nthree-way game! I’m ready.”\nShe settled down, and Adolin began setting up the cards and game\npieces. They played, and Yanagawn—eager to continue proving himself—\nseized the initiative, making bold and powerful plays at the start. The game\nboard soon grew complex.\n“I have more news from Urithiru,” May said. “The Shattered Plains are\nofficially lost. All our forces have retreated.”\nAdolin groaned softly.\n“Can we be reinforced?” Yanagawn asked, suddenly excited. “Can those\nforces come here?” He placed a card, then replaced it with the appropriate\npiece from his game set, now that its characteristics were fully known. “I\nknow they can’t use the Oathgate, but there were a lot of Windrunners at the\nShattered Plains, right? Could they fly here overnight?”\nMay placed her own pieces, careful not to respond to the emperor. What\na strange dance everyone performed around him."

        "text": "Shattered Plains, right? Could they fly here overnight?”\nMay placed her own pieces, careful not to respond to the emperor. What\na strange dance everyone performed around him.\n“It’s a good question,” Adolin said. “May?”\n“I’ve asked the Windrunners,” she said, “to send whoever can be spared.\nThey’re worn out, as you can imagine, but it looks like some will be\ndispatched.” She hesitated. “Adolin, your aunt has returned, but not your\nfather. Brightness Navani can’t infuse spheres with Stormlight, and her\nTowerlight escapes too quickly from both people and gemstones. There’s\nonly enough to send a few Windrunners—and it will take hours for them to\nget here on a single Lashing.”\nAdolin tried to let himself hope they would arrive in time, but he found it\ndifficult to summon the optimism. He’d spent too long hoping for the Azish\nreinforcements. He glanced up as he heard distant horns, but it wasn’t a call\nfor the wounded yet. Only a warning that no shift change was coming. No\none would sleep tonight. Unfortunately, exhausted soldiers were better than\nno soldiers.\nYanagawn placed his next piece, and in so doing took a dominant\nposition on the game board. He sat back, pleased—and rightly so. He was\ndoing better than either Adolin or May. Therefore it was satisfying to watch\nYanagawn’s complete disbelief as, over the next half hour, he was\nsystematically destroyed.\nYanagawn scrambled to recover. He tried to employ the tactics Adolin\nhad taught him. He made a few mistakes, a great number of ordinary\nmoves, and even a few legitimately brilliant ones. He lost anyway, crushed\nas May and Adolin allied against him. Adolin quickly mopped up May, who\nwas forced to retreat—though she finished with more points than\nYanagawn. Which had likely been one of her best outcomes. He could tell\nshe was proud of doing as well as she had; towers was rarely taught to\nwomen. Indeed, he’d heard that women had trouble finding capable\nopponents willing to play them.\n“How?” Yanagawn said, looking at the dismal results. “How did I lose?\nYou two talked it through ahead of time and decided to defeat me\ntogether?”\n“No,” May said. “We simply played by best principles.”\nAdolin leaned forward. “This is a lesson that doesn’t come up very often\nin real life, but it’s vital to learn, because when it does come up it can lead\nto disaster. You remember my key lesson? The most powerful force wins?”\n“Unless,” Yanagawn said, “terrain, incompetence, or random chance\ninterfere.”\n“Yes,” Adolin said.\n“But I was the most powerful force!”\n“No,” Adolin said, and gestured at the board. “May and I together were.\nThis is the lesson, Yanagawn. In a contest of one-on-one, you should\npresent power and dominate every chance you get. However, in a contest\nbetween three or more parties, that’s not the case.”\n“Two weaker forces,” May said, “will always align against the strongest\none. By presenting strength, you become a target, galvanizing your enemies\nto put aside their differences.” She began cleaning up the pieces, admiring"

It can get messy when there\nare ten participants all choosing sides …”\n“It’s sometimes called the Sunmaker’s Gambit,” Adolin added.\n“Drawing in a third party to a battle, knowing that you cannot win without\nthem.”\nYanagawn stared at the board. “So … what should I have done?”\n“Play more carefully,” Adolin said. “Feign weakness. Or make alliances\nearly.” He paused, then shrugged. “Or build up enough power that you\nalone are stronger than all of your opponents at once. That’s hard, but valid\ntoo.”\n“That sounds complicated,” Yanagawn said.\n“Welcome to politics,” Adolin said. “Two parties on a battlefield is\nmerely warfare: they fight until one leaves. Three parties on a battlefield is\na negotiation; it transforms into an entirely different game.” He shook his\nhead. “I dislike that dynamic, honestly. Towers is so much simpler with two\nplayers, just like a duel. Then it can be about actual skill.”\n“Skill in politics is a skill,” May said.\n“One I’m bad at. Sword on sword is so much cleaner.” Adolin looked up\nat Yanagawn. “But listen, this game tries to replicate the real battlefield—\nand in this case it does. Multiple players makes things messy. Learn the\nlesson.”\n“One on one,” Yanagawn said, “hit hard. One on one on one … defend.\nIs this the fourth way to lose a battle where you’re the strongest party? The\none you promised to tell me?”\n“It’s not,” Adolin said, “but it might as well be. Pretend it is.”\nYanagawn gave him a frown, but Adolin finished tidying the pieces.\nHe’d always hated the fourth rule. It seemed to favor people like his father.\nIt—\nThe horns sounded once more.\nThat was it. A desperate signal, the type Kushkam had sent warnings he\nmight need. All able-bodied men were called, regardless of experience. The\ncity was appallingly short on men at this point; too many had been recruited\nfor the battles to the south, and too many others had fled the city or been\nsent to farming operations to feed the armies.\nAnyone left was called to come—including the crippled, the elderly, and\nany women willing to fight. That would include Adolin, who started\nstrapping on his peg. He wouldn’t wear the Plate, but he could hold a shield\nand mostly keep his balance. He quested out to Maya, to check if maybe he\ncould get a Blade.\nClose … she sent. Getting close …\nHow close?\nHours. Some hours. Difficult to judge in the beads.\nMaya … can you actually win this war for us? With those spren you\nbring?\nMaybe. Maybe, Adolin.\nWell … that was something. He had to resist summoning her, just in\ncase. But if he didn’t … Storms. He might not last the night.\nMay was already reaching for her mail and helmet."

We’ll pass on the location to the Windrunners, who should\nbe able to sneak in and pull him out if they arrive too late.”\nThe guards saluted him.\n“I should fight,” Yanagawn said, rising. “I should—”\nAdolin reached across the game board and rested a hand on Yanagawn’s\nshoulder. One of the scribes in the back gasped, but everyone else was used\nto this by now.\n“If you die,” Adolin said softly, “this kingdom has nothing left to hope\nfor.”\n“You’ve been training me to fight,” Yanagawn said. “You were excited\nwhen I went to battle earlier!”\n“We had a chance of winning then,” Adolin said, “and you brought with\nyou a large force of reserve troops. This is different. You only have six. And\nYanagawn … you’re not a soldier, not yet. There is no need for you to die\nhere.”\nThe younger man’s eyes began to tear up. “It’s that bad?”\nAdolin nodded, grim.

More importantly, Notum had seen more Fused\narriving.\n“Take him there,” Adolin said to the guards. “Right now.”\nThe horns sounded again. More desperate. Adolin turned, his stupid peg\nslipping.

Then he deliberately looked back toward the ocean.\n“I was a child,” he said, “when I first climbed this corpse. I liked to\npretend I was a famous hunter of greatshelled beasts—that I had felled it.\nTruth was, everyone in the village had heard of it crawling up here, and I\nonly managed to visit a week after it died.”\n“Mraize,” she said, standing taller. “We need to end this. You and I.”\n“I know,” he said softly. He nodded toward the waves. “Do you think\nthere’s anything out there? Across the ocean? Like the fanciful tales claim?”\n“Honestly, no,” Shallan admitted, keeping her distance. “If you look at\nthe strength the highstorm builds over water … well, it’s difficult even for\nsettlements on Roshar’s eastern shore to survive. The Shattered Plains are\nhundreds of miles inland, and they struggle. I find it difficult to imagine\nlittle inhabited islands like in the stories …”\n“Though?” he asked, and seemed to understand that with her, there\nwould be a though.\n“… though,” she confessed, “I wish for them to exist. They sound so\ninteresting, so mysterious.”\n“They do exist,” he said, turning his head upward toward the darkening\nsky. Toward the stars. “Up there. Islands in the sky, far distant. Worlds with\nwonders we can only imagine.”\n“She never took you, did she?” Shallan asked, despite having already\nguessed the answer.\n“No,” he admitted. “I was promised I could go if I successfully recruited\nus a Radiant.” He stood up on the shell right below her, turning. “Now I am\nto be punished for choosing poorly. Ten more years, with no chances to\ntravel offworld. I might never see those places, little knife.”\n“You want me to feel sad for you?” Shallan asked.\n“You will, whether I want it or not. It is your nature.”\nTen years. A harsh punishment, considering—as she was coming to\nrealize—how much he wanted to travel to collect trophies of his own. But\nsomething about it didn’t sit right with Shallan. Harsh punishments were\ncertainly part of the Ghostblood way, but only if they served as motivation.\nEverything they did was about giving incentives, manipulating a situation.\nShe sensed a hollowness to his eyes.

He was waiting for me to get close.\n“Mraize,” she said softly, “can we not find another way?”\n“I … have been asking that too.”\nThat part sounded honest.\n“Where is Iyatil?” Shallan said. “Your spren invited me into this vision\n… your job is, in part, to distract me, isn’t it? While she does the actual\nwork of finding the prison?”\nHe didn’t reply. From him, a good sign that she’d guessed correctly—\nthough that too could be manipulation. That was the problem with their\nrelationship. She never knew exactly where she stood with Mraize. Even\nwith other spies, like her Lightweavers, she knew where she stood—but for\nall his claims about the Ghostbloods being open, she didn’t know him.\nShe was beginning to feel like she never would.\nThey took a long moment, watching each other from a distance, him atop\na dead beast and her wearing a false face.\n“Did you know,” he whispered, “there is a world out there with an ocean\nin the sky? Another where people fly upon kites, as if every man were a\nWindrunner. Yet another where the gods can make any object stand up and\nwalk? I will see them each someday, little knife. And claim a trophy to\nremember them by.”\n“Walk away from Iyatil,” she said. “Go, on your own.”\n“It’s difficult to reach some of them,” he said. “A few, even she has\nnever visited. Some are said to be myths. I’d love to sort through lies and\nlegends, but I have made oaths, Shallan. I will be bound by them. If I am\nnot, what kind of man am I?”\nHe left an implication in it. That she had walked away from hers. And\nfrom him.\n“When next we meet,” he said, turning and sitting back down, “be ready\nto fight. Try to hold me back from that which I’ve chased for my entire life.\nThe dreams of a little boy, who once climbed atop a dead carcass to\npretend.”\nThe vision burst, and she was pulled into the Spiritual Realm again. She\nfelt powerless, frustrated. And ashamed at those emotions, when she should\nhave tried right then to end him.\nI need to stop being distracted by Mraize though, she thought. I need to\nfind Iyatil. Or better, the prison.\nBut how?\nWell, it did seem that Mishram had been influencing their visions.\nRenarin agreed. So … maybe she needed to stop hiding. Let Odium show\nher what he wished. And hope that somewhere in those visions was the clue\nshe needed to beat Iyatil to the prison.\nKaladin worked on dinner in the broken monastery chamber, the sun having\nbarely kissed the horizon. Close by, Nale sat against the wall. He bore a\nhaunted expression, his eyes red from crying.

The\nman who heard the songs of Roshar long ago. I … am not him. I remember\nhim.”\n“I know,” Kaladin said as he stirred his stew by a small fire in the night.\n“I’ve felt the same.”\n“I want to be better,” Nale said. “I want to be that man, the one who\nstood against the law to defend those who deserved mercy. That is the only\npath to true justice. How? How can I see clearly once more?”\n“Kaladin will help,” Szeth promised.\nWell, Szeth’s enthusiasm was what Kaladin deserved. While Kaladin still\nwasn’t certain he could help Heralds, he could try. It seemed to him nobody\never had.\nNale lifted his hand toward Szeth and summoned a Shardblade. Not the\none he’d been fighting with earlier. That had been his Radiant Blade—this\nwas his Honorblade, delicate, with twin slits along it and a large pommel.\n“Take it, Szeth,” Nale whispered. “Hold it until … until I am sure I can\ncarry it again. I … I am not … I am not a man, or a Herald, of justice right\nnow …”\nSzeth looked to Kaladin, who nodded, tasting his stew. The last sunlight\nvanished. It was the ninth and final night.\nSzeth took the sword from Nale—who in the hours since the fight had\nbecome frail, halting, barely able to move. Szeth wrapped him in Kaladin’s\nblue Kholin cloak, as the Herald was shivering, then fetched him something\nto drink.\nSyl folded her arms and stopped humming. “So …” she said. “Now\nwhat?”\n“The last monastery,” Szeth said, joining them by the fire. “I have not\nyet cleansed my homeland. I must somehow deal with the Unmade who\nbanished me all those years ago, after turning the Honorbearers against me,\nfooling even my father.”\n“No,” Nale said softly.\nThey all turned from the fire toward him beside the wall, wrapped in the\ncloak. He was staring at his cup, which trembled in his fingers. “There is no\nUnmade.”\n“What?” Szeth said. “The Voice in my head. Everything I saw. The\ncorruption of my people!”\nNale closed his eyes.\n“Ishar,” Syl said. “It’s Ishar, isn’t it?”\nNale nodded.\n“All of it?” Szeth said. “That was him?”\n“Yes,” Nale whispered.\n“How?” Syl demanded.\n“There are wells of power,” Nale whispered, “associated with the gods.\nYou have likely heard of one at the Horneater Peaks.”\n“So,” Kaladin said, “Ishar found Honor’s well of power and used it\nsomehow?”\n“Honor’s power refuses the touch of men,” Nale said, “and his\nperpendicularity moves. Cultivation’s power at the Peaks is carefully\nmonitored by her spren, and cannot be accessed by mortals. But Odium’s\npower … it dislikes him, thinks him weak. Mishram found its hiding place,"

Mishram found its hiding place,\nand gained the ability to Connect to all of the singers. Ishar knew this, and\n…”\n“Damnation,” Kaladin whispered, feeling cold. “The Bondsmith Herald\ntook up the power of Odium?”\n“Only a fraction of it,” Nale said. “It let him Connect to this land and\nbecome a god to the people here … That is what the Honorbearers\nfollowed, Szeth. A true divinity, to their eyes, who could show them the\nfuture. Wars to come …”\n“Voidbringers,” Syl whispered.\n“No,” Nale said. “Something worse … We did not believe the\nVoidbringers would return.”\n“All this time,” Szeth said, “it was one of the Heralds I heard?”\n“He wanted to make a true soldier of you. He did not like me or my\nSkybreakers much at the time, as this was right after Billid and his\ndissenters broke off from me with their traitorous spren.”\n“There are Skybreaker dissenters?” Szeth asked.\n“Yes. Often, through the centuries … I usually can bring them back … I\nshould have seen. Regardless, Ishar was looking for new Heralds to replace\nus, but was constantly frustrated that his Honorbearers in Shinovar never\nrose to the occasion. He wanted them to fight, to become warriors. It is …\nwhat Odium does … and I think that infected Ishar …”\nNale opened his eyes again. “Even when you were wrong, you managed\nto see more clearly than the rest of us, Szeth. You are not Truthless. We\ndenied the Return. We let it happen without fighting it, and at times actually\njoined the enemy. We are Truthless. Ishar, Herald of Wisdom, is Truthless.”\n“Storms,” 12124 whispered, appearing beside Szeth. He regarded them,\nhis face a void of stars. “Storms!”\n“Ishar waits at the final monastery?” Kaladin said, stirring the stew.\nNale nodded. “Where spren gather. Where Szeth will be initiated as a\nHerald, a real one, to lead us. Somehow I knew that we needed you, Szeth,\nalthough I was broken. Does that mean there’s hope for me, even now?”\nSzeth looked to Kaladin for support.\n“Absolutely,” Kaladin said.\n“Then we go to the final monastery,” Szeth said.\n“We will need Stormlight,” Kaladin said.\n“There is a stash near our destination,” Nale mumbled, “at a hidden\nretreat of mine. We can reach it before dawn.”\n“We travel through the night, then,” Szeth said. “And arrive in the\nmorning. To confront Ishu-son-God.”\nKaladin nodded, and began ladling stew into bowls. As he did so, he\nglanced to Nale, huddled by the wall, cold and miserable. I was wrong\nearlier, wasn’t I? Kaladin thought. During our fight, I thought he was\nincomprehensible.

But if you do this, it is likely the last time you\nwill play. This also is not an adage for towers.\n—Proverbs for Towers and War, Zenaz, date unknown\nAdolin had drilled in pike block formations, but had never been in battle\nmanning one. Doing so now—in the last stand to protect Azimir—proved\none of the most humiliating experiences of his life.\nWhen he and May arrived at their posts—charging through the night\nwhile carrying enormous pikes well over ten feet long—they were sent to\ndifferent points in the line. Split apart because the commander in charge,\nthough apologetic, didn’t want “two weak links next to one another.”\nAdolin had to strap his longsword to his back—because at his hip it\nmight knock into others in the line. He was positioned somewhere in the\nmiddle of the block that was holding the extended breach in the stone wall\nof the dome. It was right at ground level, ripped open by the Fused who had\nin turn been killed by Taln. That gap, which had been expanded in the hours\nsince that assault, was some forty feet long.\nThe defenders had placed chunks of rubble across it—more stumbling\nblock than fortification—and held that gap with a large pike line. Modern\npike formations were less shield wall and more an anti-cavalry defensive\nposition, often with crossbowmen at the wings. Tonight they deployed a\nmore classical arrangement: a shield wall in front, with two ranks of pikes\nbehind.\nThe front row employed shields and short spears to hold the enemy back.\nThe second rank lined up tightly and held the pikes in two hands, stabbing\nthem over the shoulders of the front rank to kill enemy soldiers. A third row\nstood at the ready, resting and getting water, but also sometimes bringing\npikes to bear—reaching past two ranks—during a particularly difficult rush.\nAdolin was put into the back line first, filling a hole among soldiers who\nwere sweating and gulping water among ever-present fearspren,\nexhaustionspren, and painspren.

By now, there were no Alethi blocks or\nAzish blocks; the two regiments had been fully integrated. This section was\ncommanded by a tall Azish man with scars on his bald scalp.\nHe gave the order to prepare for the ranks to swap, and the men around\nAdolin groaned softly. Not enough time to rest, not nearly enough. They\nneeded far more troops, as the enemy was trying to break through each of\nthe doorways on the ground level and break out from the balcony above.\nEach section was defended with flagging troops, many of whom were\nuntrained.\nAdolin could taste the desperation in the air as he was ordered forward.\nThe second pike line withdrew, folding around the third pike line, who\nstepped forward into their places. The others put Adolin to shame as they\nefficiently brought their pikes into an overhand grip and let the inner line\nslip past them. Adolin’s pike clattered against that of a retreating soldier,\nand he nearly got them into a snarl, earning a curse from the man. In this\ndim light, the fellow couldn’t see who Adolin was, which was probably best\nfor both of them.\nAdolin hefted his pike and moved it into place, trying his best to protect\nthe spearmen in the front line before him. Beyond was a dark gap, broken\nonly by the glowing gemstones in the singers’ beards. A sea of red, blue,\npurple, and yellow stars. That and glowing red eyes marking Regals.\nThe defenders had killed a great number of singers—at great cost, yes,\nbut it meant stormforms couldn’t bring down this pike line easily, nor could\ndireforms just rip through it. There weren’t enough Regals remaining, and it\ndidn’t seem the Fused that Notum had seen earlier today were ready yet.\nSo, it came down to the dregs: the weakened, wounded, and exhausted\nhuman defenders against the singer grunts who had seen tens of thousands\nof their kind die during this assault. Adolin tried not to think about who he\nwas killing: people who arguably were barely a year old. Legitimately\nangry at what had been done to them, they had been taken in by Odium,\nmade soldiers, and now were forced to charge pike blocks. Adolin grunted\nas they came in again, knocking aside pikes, trying to get close and batter\nthrough the shield wall.\nMost of his work was in stabilizing and resetting his pike. Pulling it\nback, stabbing in. Grueling work that quickly had his arms burning. It was a\nnightmare, lit only by a few weak sphere lanterns. He stood for a\nfrighteningly long time, trying to shove back a tide of aggressive troops.\nIt was a miracle the defenders hadn’t fallen. The line would buckle and\nshift as the singers hit it, but Adolin’s entire world was that storming pike,\nheavy enough that it was hard to even keep raised, let alone do something\nuseful with. Secondary was the pain of trying to keep himself from slipping\nbecause of his missing leg. He could sometimes lodge the peg against the\nedge of a cobblestone and get some leverage, until it inevitably slipped and\nhe stumbled."

He could sometimes lodge the peg against the\nedge of a cobblestone and get some leverage, until it inevitably slipped and\nhe stumbled.\nHe felt sorry for the poor souls who had to not only keep their pikes in\nplace, but also put up with him. Adolin gritted his teeth and kept at it for\nwhat seemed like an eternity—long past when his arms started going numb.\nHe’d never been a liability on a battlefield before, and he hoped he wasn’t\none now, but storms … the experience was absolutely, thoroughly, horribly\nhumiliating.\nMy muscles aren’t used to this work. My ego isn’t accustomed to\nstanding in a formation rather than running around in Plate, virtually\nimpervious.\nWeren’t there supposed to be rotations? Weren’t they supposed to have a\nchance to—\nThe captain of their rank called for rotation. Adolin gladly pulled back,\nand was embarrassed as he immediately knocked pikes against another man\ncoming in to relieve him. Storms send it wasn’t the same one. Adolin\nstumbled out of the line, and someone blessedly took his pike while a\nwoman offered him a ladle of water. He drank three in a row, and then\nchecked the moon.\nIt had been at most fifteen minutes. Storms. They had to keep this up all\nnight? He settled down on the ground, allowed ten minutes or so before\nthey’d have to stand in line again. Judging by the setting first moon, they\nhad twelve hours until his father’s confrontation—which would happen at\nmidday at Urithiru. Adolin barely felt he could handle a second shift, let\nalone twenty more.\nThe officer of the rank stepped up to Adolin and spoke softly. “I can\nrotate you out, Brightlord. You don’t have to go in on next shift.”\n“No,” Adolin said. “As long as the others go in, I go in.”\nThe tall man, mostly a shadow in the night, seemed concerned. “The\nnext shift is the difficult one, Brightlord.”\n“More difficult than that?” Adolin said, amazed.\n“Everyone takes a turn in the shield wall.”\nStorms, of course. The pikes were hard to carry, but the soldiers in the\nmost danger would be in that front line. They rotated in a different way, as\nthey had different equipment, but it made sense that everyone would do a\nstint there.\nIf he’d just survived a nightmare, what was coming would be … Storms,\nit would be Damnation itself. Adolin sat on the ground, listening to men\nshout, grunt, and bleed.\n“Send me in,” he said to the officer, gritting his teeth. “I’ll be better on\nthe front line anyway—I haven’t built the muscles for holding a pike. I’ll be\nmore effective with spear and shield.” He gestured to his peg leg, and felt\nstrangely—and stupidly—embarrassed at how poorly his trouser leg fit\naround it. “But don’t put me next to someone else weaker or untrained.”\n“Less and less I can do about that lately, Brightlord,” the Azish man said,\nlooking over his shoulder as another group of reinforcements arrived from\nthe recruitment tent. Five men who carried their pikes even more\nuncertainly than Adolin."

Five men who carried their pikes even more\nuncertainly than Adolin.\nAdolin sighed and took another drink, but his break was up before he\nhad a chance to appreciate it. He was handed a spear and shield, sent\nforward at the side with some others—they’d rotate in from the edges while\nthe men at the center of this section retreated through the middle of the\npikemen.\nMinutes later, he was fighting for survival against a tide of darkness\ncome alive.\nVisions twisted and spun around Shallan, never remaining stable for long.\nShe saw her father beating her brother Balat—then she was killing her\nfather, singing as she strangled him. Anger, pain, and betrayal. From parent\nto child to child. All of that, and so full of hatred—as her father hated his\nfather and hated his children, who hated him.\nTime distorted and scenes bled together.\nHatred.\nLoathing.\nOdium.\nThis was his realm, and Shallan had let him find her—so he punished her\nwith scenes of killing. Her mother gasping, eyes burning. Tyn impaled on\nthe end of Shallan’s Blade. Testament screaming as Shallan ripped her very\nsoul apart.\nThat made it so difficult to remember the reconciliation she’d just had\nwith her mother. Such happy moments were washed away, and she was\nback with Tyn in a grand tent that had seemed so magnificent to Shallan at\nthe time—though it was nothing compared to Alethi finery. Tyn was\nstanding over her, complaining that she’d have to pin Shallan’s death on\nVathah.\nI’m sorry that you have to learn the lesson this way. Sometimes, we must\ndo things we don’t like, kid …\nShallan struck first, killing the woman with a Shardblade. Tyn died with\nburned-out eyes, and something was born inside Shallan. A persona who\ncould kill, though it wouldn’t find a name for some time yet. She had two\nbudding personas then, and maybe a third—the child—which she had never\nacknowledged.\nBut two to help her. One to hold memories. Another to fight and kill\nwhen she could not. These two would be bloodstained so Shallan could\ncontinue to function. Eventually Shallan would take one and make of it Veil\n—then later, when she needed a swordswoman, would take the other and\nmake Radiant, but both had been growing for far longer than that.\nIn this vision, Shallan stabbed again, chopping at Tyn’s fallen body. And\nFormless stood behind her, nodding. That … wasn’t how this had happened.\nWas it?\nIn a flash she was killing Mraize, and her sword left blood as his head\nrolled free. From there she murdered Wit, who laughed. Then Jasnah, stern\nand unloving, dying as she chastised Shallan for her sword form.\n“No,” Shallan whispered. “I wouldn’t kill them.”\nYet in the vision she did, over and over. Everyone who had ever loved\nher, helped her, or offered her mentoring. She’d killed her parents, then\nneeded replacements to kill as well. Sebarial and Palona. Dalinar and\nNavani.\nBlood on her hands, and her personas couldn’t help her."

She knew this wasn’t real. She’d walked into this\nintentionally, but that didn’t matter anymore. Her will faltered as she was\nforced to watch, time and time again, as someone she loved died at her own\nhands.\nDon’t let him win. Don’t believe.\nYet it was relentless. A repetitive chorus that proclaimed she was\ndangerous to anyone who got close to her. She would outgrow them, then\nmurder them.\nJust as she’d done to her parents.\nRhythms vibrated through Rlain as he appeared on a battlefield. Nearby,\nhumans fled before a cheering host of singers. It was … the end. A fight\nwon.\nOthers soon began to bring the warriors water and bandages. And they\nwere beautiful. Civilians in flowing robes that displayed carapace to its\nfullest. Outfits of fine stitching and sturdy design, made of seasilk, dyed to\ncomplement skin tones. They spoke of the warriors having fought to defend\nthe city. A singer city.\nHe longed to see it. Show me, he thought. Please?\nHe was among them suddenly. In their city—beautiful, with buildings\nthat incorporated the flow of crem as it fell, sculpting it over the long term\ninto shapes and designs. Natural patterns, making the city feel as if it were a\nfeature of the landscape, not an imposition constructed atop it.\nHere were blacksmiths who worked forges, artists who created swirling,\nflowing murals from sand or bits of colored shell, craftspeople who\nconstructed drums or other instruments he didn’t recognize. All done out\nunder the sun, instead of hidden away in a workshop, bearing artform or\nother magnificent forms. They wanted to be beneath the light and within the\nwind.\nHe found himself humming to the Rhythm of Awe. It was true. He’d\nalways imagined they had culture, creations, nations, that rivaled those of\nthe humans—but a part of him had felt an itching worry. That perhaps the\nsingers weren’t capable of such majesty.\nThis was wonderful. Not just versions of what the humans did, but\nsomething distinctive. Marvelous. Theirs. In all these visions he’d been\nseeing the human perspective, except in that first one. Now he finally\nexperienced something else.\nHis heritage.\nThis isn’t what you need to see, a voice whispered. It was Mishram. I’m\nsorry.\n“Send me back then,” he said, reluctant.\nHe was again on the battlefield.\nI hate this, Mishram whispered. I hate you. See.\nWarriors were gathering at the center of the battlefield, and he joined\nthem. Singers did not line up or form ranks. Even in this ancient army,\nnobody wore uniforms. There were leaders, by necessity, but no platoons or\ndivisions.\nIn this, Rlain had come to think they might be able to learn from the\nhumans. There was strength in regimentation, much like there was strength\nin a lattice structure of reeds forming a basket.\nBridger of Minds, something seemed to whisper to him on the wind.

You can heal us.\nRlain spun and looked, but saw only a sea of singer faces, each with its\nown distinctive pattern—red, black, white mixing. He’d heard a human\nchild call him “painted” once, but of course that was a very human way of\nseeing it. In reality, the humans were the ones who seemed painted,\ncovering their colors with one hue.\nHe tried not to think of it that way. Neither was painted, and neither was\nbetter. There could be a certain handsomeness to either. You could see\nhuman eyes and expressions better, as their irises were so easy to catch\nagainst the white. He found that appealing, and the mop of hair that was so\nunruly at times, where singer hairstrands tended to fall straight.\nHe looked around, wishing to find Renarin. Something was happening\nthere, something he hadn’t hoped for—but which was exciting and\ninvigorating. After years without even a basic warpair, and despairing of\never knowing one, was he actually close to something better? Something\nmore?\nHe wanted to seize that, to hold to Renarin and never let go. He felt\nelated, and kept attuning the Rhythm of Joy, including when he deliberately\nshifted off it for another reason.\nThere isn’t time for frivolities during this important moment, he thought.\nThis is why it’s better not to think of such bonds except in the proper form.\nIt’s distracting.\nBut he wanted to be distracted. Did that make him a bad soldier?\nFortunately, his attention was drawn by something manifesting at the center\nof the troops. There, on a stone elevated nine feet in the air, a figure grew\nfrom dark smoke. He knew Ba-Ado-Mishram’s face by now, but it was odd\nseeing her fully present, in a body that was nine times the size of an average\nsinger, wreathed in bloodred clothing that exposed carapace. Her entire\nfigure smoldered—wisps of dark light rising from it, the edges fuzzy. She\nwas made, it appeared, entirely of black and dark red smoke, and her eyes\nwere golden.\nThe soldiers hushed, the humming softening to the Rhythm of the\nTerrors. Mishram, so tall and dominating, like a mountain. She carried a\nstaff, which she slammed down on the rock, the sound sharp in Rlain’s ears.\nWith that thought, he realized what he might be seeing. This vision was\nbefore Mishram had been captured. It was during the time Mishram had\nbecome their god, creating the False Desolation. That must have included\nthe battle that he’d seen the tail end of, the corpses of which were still\nstrewn about behind, though the army had moved to a cleaner section of\nground to watch Mishram.\nShe hummed the Rhythm of Exultation. “A battle won,” she announced.\n“And gifts to be given.

        "text": "forth, and receive your gift.”\nShe held out a hand, and darkness rained from beneath her downturned\npalm, forming a miniature storm. A singer was tapped on the shoulder by an\nimperious stormform, then sent to stumble up before her. She nodded, and\nhe stepped into the storm—though he’d been in warform, he was but a doll\nto her, her palm large enough it could have held him.\nThe crowd grew even more still as he emerged from the darkness—\naltered, as if by a highstorm, into a new form. Direform, with glowing red\neyes, and carapace that imitated a suit of armor—more tightly closed, with\nspikes. A form of power, and one of the best for war.\nTwo more were chosen and took upon them forms of power.\n“The other Unmade,” Mishram said, her voice booming across them,\n“have agreed to support me. We are winning. Now we press the humans.\nRelentless.”\n“And Odium?” Rlain called, his voice ringing out across a quiet, awed\ncrowd of soldiers. “What of him?”\n“He is locked away,” she said, “like the human Heralds. I used his power\nto bind him for a time. He cannot waste our lives any longer.” She focused\non Rlain and reared up, standing tall rather than crouching. “Who are you,\nsoldier?”\n“I’m … I’m nobody,” Rlain said. “Why do you fight, Mishram? Don’t\nyou want peace?”\n“Humans will never want peace unless they are forced into it,” she said.\n“Once I bring them to the brink of collapse, we shall see. Who are you?”\n“Nobody,” Rlain said. “I choose to be nobody.”\nWith that, he turned and left.\nFirst alone, with many humming or shouting to words of betrayal. He\nleft among the corpses, and then … was followed. One here, one there, not\na flood. A trickle. Some just … turned and walked away.\nMishram appeared in front of him. “Why? Why do you leave? We’re\nwinning!”\nRlain pulled to a stop. Why?\n“I rejected him,” he said, “but not to replace him with another war.”\n“We can win!”\n“At what cost?” he said. “I’m done.”\nHe walked around her. And others, they did join him. The listeners, who\nwould together break ties with Mishram and the rest of their kind, giving up\ntheir forms in order to seek their own way.\n“Singer,” Mishram said, standing tall, calling after him. “This will not\nserve you. I stepped into God’s role. I took his pool, his perpendicularity,\nand am tied to every singer who holds a form. To every spren, to every fiber\nof Roshar.”\nRlain looked back at her, hesitating.\nMishram’s expression changed, and she suddenly hummed to Confusion,\nglancing around. “It is you. It is this. Yes …” She focused on him again.\n“This was the day. The day I realized … I realized that I had to find another\nway.”\n“When the listeners left?” Rlain said. “That was when you decided to\nmeet with the humans?”\n“I was betrayed …” Her eyes flashed. “Because of you.”"

Toathan. That name … He knew that name. One of\nthe ancestors. His ancestor, a name recorded in song. Others joined him,\nasking what they should do. He could see confusion in their eyes, worry\nabout the war.\n“Something is wrong with all forms lately,” a femalen said. “You can all\nfeel it, can’t you? It feels wrong. The rhythms change. The songs warp.”\n“I’m done,” another said. “It’s never going to end. We just keep fighting.\nAnd fighting. And fighting.”\n“Go,” Rlain said to them. “Gather your families. We will leave together,\nenter the storm and abandon our forms. She has taken up the mantle of\ndivinity, and in so doing, touched everything. That wrongness you feel? It\nwill dig deep into us if we do not act. It will change our minds, draw us\nback to her.”\n“Abandon our … forms?” the femalen asked.\n“What are we without forms?” said another, to Anxiety.\n“Free,” Rlain said to Resolve.\nThey nodded, and went running for the warcamp in the near distance. To\ngather children, once-mates. Rlain was proud, in this instance, to stand in\nhis ancestor’s place. The next part would be traumatic for them, as they\neventually entered a dull fog of thought—where only a few songs would\nsurvive.\nAnd in the distance, Mishram stood tall. She let us go, he realized. He’d\nnever considered that. He’d imagined them sneaking away, but this was the\nfull light of day, beneath the sun and sky.\nFor all her faults, she hadn’t forced them to stay. And after this, when\nshe’d been asked to seriously consider peace, she’d … learned from the\nlisteners. He saw her standing there, surveying the battlefield, and she\nseemed to waver.\n“It’s a different thing entirely to see them die when you are in command,\nisn’t it, Mishram?” he asked.\nYes. Her voice vibrated through him. I wish the best of you hadn’t chosen\nto leave. Perhaps you’d have helped me.\n“Perhaps,” he said. “Or perhaps we’d have been corrupted by your\nambition.”\nNow what? she asked. You know my failures, my pains, Bridger of\nMinds. I want … want so badly to break something, everything, for what\nwas done to me. I … I cannot hold it back, most days. I rage, I scream. I\nwill kill you, if I can. I fear it. What will you do, when you find me?\n“I don’t know yet,” he said, and started walking away. “Maybe I’ll just\nlisten.”\nIt was the darkest day Renarin could remember.\nThe first day the visions had struck him. The day he’d worried he was\nbeyond redemption."

        "text": "listen.”\nIt was the darkest day Renarin could remember.\nThe first day the visions had struck him. The day he’d worried he was\nbeyond redemption.\nIt had been only … what, a year and a half ago? Yet he felt so much\nyounger, isolated and alone in his room at the warcamps. Dalinar liked\nausterity, and that affected his sons as well. So Renarin sat on a hard\nwooden chair, in a room with too little light, enveloped in darkness.\nThe visions were obviously trying to upset him. He stood up, and it\nbegan: his first time seeing the future. He saw the coming storm, and\nnumbers in the air, indicating the time until its looming arrival. The\nEverstorm.\nThe sights had terrified him—and as he remembered this day, he\nscreamed, hands over his eyes, overwhelmed by how much noise and chaos\ncrashed into him. Yet despite all this sensation, he now understood. The\nyounger him had seen into the Spiritual Realm, which meant all the\npossibilities were vying for his attention.\nHe cut off his screams, and forced himself to watch, as he hoped to be\nable to parse it better now. But he couldn’t help remembering his fear—his\nworry at what was wrong with him. That he—in seeing the future—was to\nbe consigned to Damnation for his heresy.\nRenarin’s father saw visions too, but in his, he lived the life of a Knight\nRadiant of old. He saw Nohadon, the great king, or witnessed grand events\nlike the Recreance. When Renarin saw visions, they were of blackness, a\ncoming storm, and even—in the most terrible moments—his father falling\nto the influence of the enemy and becoming Odium’s general.\nThe messaging seemed clear. Something was wrong with Renarin. I will\nbe sorry, Glys said, his voice anguished. I will be, Renarin.\nEventually, Glys would offer some explanation—that he, as a newer\nspren and only recently defected to Sja-anat, hadn’t realized what all this\nwould do to Renarin. Neither of them had understood the greater truth: that\nwhat Renarin saw wasn’t inevitable, and the possibilities he saw were\nheavily influenced by the enemy. Renarin stood up. He’d spent so long\nthinking about the visions, and how to avoid their terrible possibilities. But\nwhat about the present moment? Shouldn’t he work to change the now?\nIt is not our strength, Glys whispered. We focus on what will be.\n“I have to do a lot of things that I’m not very good at,” Renarin said.\n“That’s basically my whole life, Glys.”\nSoon after this, the younger Renarin would learn to channel all this\ninformation into a visualization. Stained glass windows; a way to bring\norder to the chaos of the Spiritual Realm. He could do that now, so he\nturned around, and the flashing visions crystallized and grew into windows\nsurrounding him as if he were in a dark room—light shining from outside.\nIn the windows, he saw dates depicted in glyphs in the glass. He saw\nfurious winds, crimson lightning, the eyes of the enemy peering through—\nbloody and terrible. But the past was dead and gone. What of the now?\nNew windows grew around him, vibrant, each color so bright and vivid"

They showed a dark landscape, crops\nthat barely grew, withered towns, a people enslaved. He saw his father’s\nfuneral pyre, which was foolishness. When his father died, he’d be turned\ninto a statue like all Alethi kings and highprinces.\nEach of these windows had signs of Mishram’s touch, but they were in\ncorners, hidden. As if she were … piggybacking on Odium’s visions.\nI do think all of this is leading us somewhere, Renarin thought to\nhimself. Odium is trying to break us, but Mishram is using his attacks to tell\nus something. About isolation, and betrayal, and pain …\nHe found these windows too dominated by Odium to tell him what he\nwanted to know. “This is your influence, isn’t it?” Renarin said to the sky.\n“I’ve always seen the future you want. Even if you weren’t paying attention\nto me directly, your shadow looms long.”\nIt has to be that way, Renarin, Glys thought to a mournful rhythm. It is\nwhat I am. Of him, now.\n“No,” Renarin said. “I spent my life being told I had to become an\nardent, Glys. Because people couldn’t think of anything else to do with a\nhighborn boy who couldn’t fight.” He squeezed his hands into fists to keep\nfrom trembling. People thought he was emotionless because he didn’t take\npart in their conversations or find what they did interesting, but they were\nwrong. He felt too many emotions. When he’d been a child, it had been\ndifficult to contain them.\nThey could all read each other better than he could read them, and that\nmade them assume they understood him. When the truth was, he didn’t\nwork by the same rules, and he never had. He saw the world from a\ndifferent perspective.\nHe could make that his strength. He shoved into the darkness again,\naway from these windows, and as he did, he summoned his Light. Despite\nhis many attempts to learn to make illusions like Shallan did, this was what\nit always came to for him. Light growing like a ball in his hand, shining all\naround him, and showing him truth.\nThe ancient Radiants must have known this was possible, right? Their\norder was named for it. His society said that seeing the future was a terrible\nand evil thing, but maybe that was just because Odium influenced it so\nheavily. Surely there was a way to cut through it.\nEveryone saw by light. Could you see better by a purer light?\nA new set of windows began to grow around Renarin, like crystals\nforming. He held his hand high, filling it with the power of this realm, and\n—bathed in that cool, white illumination—the windows changed. Shadows\nmelted from them, fled from them. Darkness evaporated.\nRenarin was left with the truth. A dozen varieties of it. For while certain\nthings were true no matter what perspective you saw them from, that wasn’t\nthe case for most things in life. The answer to most questions was “Well, it\ndepends …” That went for inconsequential questions like what one wanted"

Glys said, awed. Can we see this?\n“We change the now, Glys,” Renarin said. “The future always begins\nwith the now.”\nEach window depicted him. Renarin the ardent was here, with a shaved\nhead and an embarrassing beard that didn’t grow in that well. Renarin the\nscholar was another option, wearing the arcane robes of the stormwardens.\nThe window presented him in a dynamic posture, but he’d known enough\nstormwardens to think poorly of their art. Perhaps that was Aunt Navani’s\nbias. People inherently viewed any man who tried to become a scholar as\nridiculous; it had infected even him.\nAnother was Renarin the general, and he found this interesting, because\nhe thought he might have been good at tactical decision-making. This him\nwore a strange uniform, one he didn’t recognize—not Alethi, though of that\ncut. He stood at Urithiru, he thought, and was older, with longer hair and a\nclean-shaven face. He studied this one a long while, for the Oathgate\nplatforms visible to the sides were covered over with fields.\nHe moved on from that window eventually, instead seeking one that he’d\nglimpsed earlier: the one window where he stood with a tall, handsome\nsinger with a skullcap of carapace and a neat, dark beard. Rlain. Was there\nonly one window where he was with Rlain in the future?\nHe has hard times ahead, Glys said.\n“What do you see of them?” Renarin asked.\nOnly what you do, but the future is … mine. I understand it. I don’t see\nfarther, or more, but better.\n“That doesn’t make a lot of sense to me, Glys,” Renarin said. “I’m\nsorry.”\nRlain, Glys said. Look at him in this picture.\nA singer wearing a Bridge Four uniform, but the city behind them was\nobviously a singer one—judging by the architecture. Indeed, it was\nprobably Kholinar.\n“If I go with him,” Renarin said, “I’ll have to turn my back on\nhumankind, to an extent.”\nAs he will need to turn his back on his kind to an extent, Glys agreed.\nBoth sides will hate both of you.\n“Like both gods hate you?” Renarin said.\nYes, Glys said softly, trembling with a rhythm. You will understand. If\nyou walk that path, you will understand, Renarin. I … do not want you to\nhave to.\n“It might be the only way,” Renarin said, looking at the depiction of\nhimself in the window, wearing singer clothing, standing with Rlain’s arm\nin his. That flowing outfit was remarkable, designed to show carapace\nRenarin didn’t have.\nRlain in a human uniform. Renarin in one of the singers’ formal outfits.\nIt was a statement.

Normal doesn’t exist.\nHe could choose any of these lives and work toward them, though none\nof them were guaranteed. Was this really the life he’d choose? The risk he’d\nchoose?\nWhy? Glys said. Why do you want to be with him?\n“Because he has tried to understand us,” Renarin said. “I love that he\ntries so hard. So many people just dismiss the different. I’ve lived that all\nmy life, seeing it all around me. But Rlain … he wants to understand\neveryone.” Renarin reached up and touched the glass. “I think he truly does\nunderstand—me. One of the only people to ever do so. Other than my\nfamily, I don’t think anyone has ever wanted to.”\nThis path leads to both pain and joy, Glys said.\n“So much better to feel,” Renarin said, “than to take the path that leads\nto only greyness and safe solitude. This is what I want. Him, yes, but also\nthe life where we try to blend these worlds.”\nWhy?\n“Because someone has to, Glys,” Renarin said, pushing on the window\nwith his hand. “My father can’t end this war by drawing lines and trying to\nenforce them. If we want to end the war for real, we have to change hearts,\nnot maps.”\nThey changed the future by changing today. He’d pushed past the\nawkwardness. He’d learned that Rlain was interested. Now, that final step.\nRenarin shoved his way through this stained glass window and vanished\nfrom his vision, relying on Glys’s guidance to enter another, where Rlain\nwas walking with a group of several hundred singers.\nRlain pulled up sharply as Renarin appeared in front of him. Then he\nstepped forward. “Renarin?”\n“Yes,” Renarin said. Then he took a deep breath, reached for Rlain, and\nkissed him.\nIt was harder than he’d have liked, given how tall Rlain was. The singer\ndidn’t flinch, fortunately—because that might have broken Renarin’s will.\nHe let Renarin take him by the sides of the face, fingers brushing carapace,\nand kiss him.\nA flood of emotions.

It wasn’t the one that others might have\nchosen, and wasn’t one that many would have chosen for him. He wasn’t\neven certain it was right, but it was what he wanted. He would merely have\nto hope that those who cared for him would understand that the decision\nwas his to make, not theirs.\nHe pulled back and waited for a reply, anxious.\n“That was … nicer than I expected,” Rlain said to the Rhythm of\nAnxiety. “Are you sure, Renarin? I don’t think that the world is going to\ntake kindly to us being together. I don’t want you to get hurt.”\n“Will you be the one to hurt me?”"

In other words, even the finest lose a significant\namount. Do not set up unless you are prepared for loss.\n—Proverbs for Towers and War, Zenaz, date unknown\nAdolin rotated through ranks in the pike block, and never had a chance to\ndraw his longsword. He held a shield and spear. He used a pike. He gulped\nwater. He grunted and he sweated.\nMen and women around him died. Shouted. Thrashed on the ground. Got\ndragged, whimpering, off to the surgeons—when possible. Often you had to\nkeep going while they screamed. If you stopped to help, then the whole city\nwould fall.\nSo he fought with dying soldiers weeping at his feet, his peg slipping in\ntheir blood. Each time one died, the line grew more strained, and the\noptions for filling those gaps more desperate. Fewer soldiers. More\nuntrained townspeople.\nThe night seemed endless. And Adolin thought, as he moved from\nstation to station—bloodletting with a spear, bloodletting with a pike, lying\non the ground and bleeding hope—that he knew what it was like to be dead.\nHe’d always secretly hated that part of Vorinism, without speaking it\naloud—not even to himself. The doctrine that upon death, they all just kept\non fighting. Gloriously, the ardents claimed. For eternity.\nWhat an awful existence. He’d tried to picture it as endless duels of\nhonor. Then he had gone to war and he’d seen what fighting was really like.\nWar was being forced to step on another man’s entrails, hearing him wail as\nyou pushed them out farther, because you had to keep fighting. War was\nknowing that the end was here, and there wasn’t a storming thing you could\ndo.\nKnowing that when you died, the best thing you could hope for was to\nbe shoved back into a line so you could spend eternity being split open time\nand time again.\nOn one rest rotation, Adolin lay and stared at the second moon, numb to\nthe passage of time, thinking about that afterlife. And he realized part of\nwhy he hated his father—because in Dalinar’s book, Oathbringer, he\noffered something better. A different God than the Almighty, a God that he\ndescribed only as a sense of warmth. A God he claimed made things right\neventually.\nHow dare Dalinar Kholin—who had butchered all his life—be the one to\noffer such an uplifting message? How dare the Blackthorn, soaked in blood,\nclaim the high ground?\nHow dare he judge Adolin for killing Sadeas and protecting their family,\nwhen Dalinar had burned Adolin’s mother alive?\nNothing made sense anymore. Adolin felt he was the only one who\nrecognized that the world had gone insane, and when he pointed it out, he\nwas told that he was being spoiled. That he needed to forgive, that he was\nthe problem, and why couldn’t he live up to his father’s wonderful\nexample?\nAdolin didn’t want to follow an example. He wanted nothing to do with\nall of this, and he wanted the good men whose names he memorized to stop\nstorming dying."

        "text": "example?\nAdolin didn’t want to follow an example. He wanted nothing to do with\nall of this, and he wanted the good men whose names he memorized to stop\nstorming dying.\nThat was what he felt. Fatalism. A desire to simply give up. It was as\ndeadly and pernicious as the terrible void inside the dome, filled with\nenemies.\nThe call came for him to rotate back to the front line. As he sat up,\nsomeone handed him a spear and shield. Hadn’t he just done this? How\nmany rotations had it been? That hadn’t been fifteen minutes to rest, had it?\nHow?\nHe yearned to lie there. They’d let him. He was a highprince. He could\nhave been a king.\nBut if he did that …\nIf he did that, then he failed Kholinar again. He’d told himself he’d have\nfought for the city—no, for his men—and stood with them until the end.\nThat he hadn’t abandoned his men on purpose. But if he lay here, then he\ndid exactly that, and he became worse than a man who had killed Sadeas.\nHe became a liar and a hypocrite.\nSo he heaved himself up, found the queue to rotate to the front, and took\nhis spot with shield and spear. Strangely, he found motivation in an\nunexpected place. Kaladin had survived worse than this as a bridgeman.\nAdolin had heard Lopen and Rock, Sigzil and Skar, describe it multiple\ntimes as they’d gone drinking together.\nAt least Adolin could fight back. The call came and he filed in, letting\nthose who had been fighting pull the wounded to safety through the center\nof the pike line. There, Adolin realized he was smiling. Stupid bridgeboy.\nWhere did he get off, being so inspiring?\nA moment of brightness. Then back to Damnation.\nJasnah knelt alone in the little temple.\nFen had left. Odium had evaporated.\nThey’d made their deal. Thaylenah would serve Odium, regardless of\nwhat happened at Dalinar’s contest of champions. It … was both the wrong\nand the right decision. Wrong for Roshar. But perhaps right for Thaylenah.\nFen had been able to negotiate her own terms, rather than depending on\nDalinar.\nYet Jasnah felt revolted. She cradled her stomach, sick. After she had\nfailed so dramatically, the presence of sculpted depictions of Talenelat\nseemed a deliberate mockery. She’d spent her life spurning the existence of\ndeity—and had now been bested by one.\nStorms. She pulled herself to the wall and sat against it, trying to\norganize her mind. The scholar’s duty, to analyze what had gone wrong. It\ncame down to two points. First, she herself had been flawed. She’d grown\nso engaged by the argument she’d forgotten the context. She’d wanted to\ndefeat Taravangian with words, but in so doing, had actually proven his\npoint to Fen. Jasnah had shown both that he was wrong for Roshar and that\nit was right for Thaylenah to make a deal with him. The prisoner’s dilemma\nindeed.\nThe second problem with her arguments was more daunting. The"

        "text": "it was right for Thaylenah to make a deal with him. The prisoner’s dilemma\nindeed.\nThe second problem with her arguments was more daunting. The\nPhilosophy of Aspiration, the very philosophy she’d relied on for so many\nyears, had failed her completely. Losing that, realizing that she might have\nbuilt the bedrock of her life upon a flawed philosophy that even she didn’t\ntruly believe, shook her to her core.\nThe greater good at any cost. If she wouldn’t pay any cost, then she gave\nonly lip service to the philosophy. If she would pay any cost, how was she\nany better than Taravangian? How many of her actions were truly in service\nof this idea? The greatest good … but how could she claim to know what\nwas right, when she could not see the scope of the cosmere?\nInstead, she tried clinging to histories—but she knew they could be\nincredibly biased. She’d spent her life struggling to sort the fiction from the\nfact, with varying success. However, all of them had warned of the dangers\nof dealing with Voidbringers—and thus, in going up against Odium and\nexpecting to win, she had refused to learn from the past. In this, the\nhistories condemned her.\nShe tried, last of all, to cling to her own mind. She thought. She\nreasoned. She had to be able to trust her conclusions. Except, huddled here\nat a midnight desk, she remembered a day when her mind itself had\nbetrayed her—and her family had locked her away. It could do so again.\nThe room grew darker somehow, despite the night, then a light\nbrightened in the center of the room. She looked up, having crouched by the\nwall unconsciously remembering those days locked away as a child. She’d\ncried in a barren corner until her mother had returned—at long last—from\nher trip and restored the sunlight.\nNo sunlight shone on her today. This was its mocking doppelganger: the\ngolden glow of Taravangian’s vestments.\nJasnah forced herself to stand. She would not stay huddled and broken\nbefore him, trapped in memories. She had sworn to herself, with the other\nVeristitalians, that she would not become so enamored with the past that it\ndominated her life.\n“I thought,” she said to Taravangian, wiping her eyes, “that you went\nwith Fen.”\n“I can do both,” he said. “I am God.”\n“There is no God.”\n“Even still, you insist?” Taravangian asked, his tone lightly amused. He\nsettled down, and a chair formed from black smoke for him. He put his\nhand to the side, and his slender golden scepter appeared, letting him\nbalance his hand atop it like a cane. “After what you’ve seen? After being\nso resoundingly outmatched?”\n“If you were God,” she said, “you would be all powerful, and would not\nneed to outmatch a woman like me. If you were God, then you would know\neverything, and could speak exactly to me the number I am thinking in my\nhead.” She met his gaze.\nNegative one point eight seven three nine, she thought.\nHe merely nodded. As she’d ascertained, he could not read her mind."

As she’d ascertained, he could not read her mind.\n“There may not be a God, but there are gods,” Jasnah said, “as Wit has\ndefined them: creatures of immense power, immortal and terrible. I accept\nyou are one of those, Taravangian. It is no shame for me to be bested by one\nwho has such capacity.”\n“Ah, but was it my power that bested you, Jasnah?”\nShe looked away. Echoes of her failure were too recent. She could not\nhold his confident, conniving gaze.\n“We,” he said softly, “are the same.”\n“You caught me in a lie,” she said. “So if we are the same, you are a liar\ntoo? You never were able to take this city, were you?”\n“Ah … well, I did lie. But not about that, Jasnah.” He waved a hand.\nNearby, a dozen dark figures rose from the stone ground, like the souls of\nthe dead. Deepest Ones, with eyes that were too large, bodies too spindly,\nalmost no carapace except where their genitals should have been, the only\nadornment on their nude bodies save for their long, knifelike fingernails.\n“They were poised to kill the members of the Thaylen Council,”\nTaravangian said, “should my negotiation with Fen fail.”\n“Impossible,” Jasnah said. “That room is lined in aluminum and hidden,\nincluding from me. We have fabrials to tell if Fused are nearby, and they\nwere deployed to—”\n“No such fabrials exist,” Taravangian said. “The artifabrians who\nclaimed to have created them serve me, and that was the lie. The fabrials\nwere invented to set you all at ease and allow my Fused to draw near. As for\nyour hidden council? It’s in the Loft Ward, behind a wineshop’s false wall.\nAt thirty-two Market Street.”\nStorms. She tried not to be intimidated by the fact that he knew that, but\n…\n“I have agents on the Thaylen Council too,” Taravangian noted.\n“Connections that go back to my mortal days, when several of them were\npart of the Diagram. You and your uncle consistently ignored the council\nand focused on Fen alone, though she is not an absolute power in this city.\nEven you, Jasnah, who speak of equality and a representative government,\nignored the elected officials today, arguing with me on Fen’s behalf only.\nYet that council is what you claim to want for your people.”\n“They’re an oligarchy,” she said. “Not what I want for Alethkar at all.”\n“So you focus on the dictator instead?” Taravangian shook his head. “It\nwas an oversight. Admit it. You should have invited them to this meeting.”\n“It was a mistake,” Jasnah whispered, backing up to the wall, watching\nthe Deepest Ones and preparing her Stormlight.\n“You needn’t worry,” Taravangian said, waving for the Fused to vanish\ninto the stones. “My point is, I did have a plan for conquering this city. My\nfriends on the council had removed the aluminum paneling in one section.\nDuring a recess they would have left, and would have returned to find—as"

Four would have survived, all loyal to\nme, and the minimum number required to manage the government.”\n“Fen could have—”\n“Fen would have been arrested,” Taravangian snapped. “She has been\nignoring the council too much—and there are legitimate worries that she\nwas overstepping her authority. My four would have immediately instigated\na tribunal against her, temporarily relieving Fen of power. She’d likely have\nwon the resulting trial, but in the meantime this city would have turned to\nme.”\nTaravangian stood, and suddenly seemed enormous. Filling the room.\nBeyond. The walls fading, all other sights vanishing. As if Jasnah was on an\nendless dark plain, with only the god Taravangian—his face suddenly more\nskeletal, his eyes recessed, golden light rising around him—standing before\nher.\n“I always had this city in hand,” he said. “However, they will be ruled\nbetter if they join me willingly. I have them now. More, I have you, Jasnah.\nFinally admitting the truth.”\n“What truth?” she asked, her voice hoarse.\n“That you have always been my servant. Everything you’ve done, from\nfreeing my granddaughter, to your murders on the streets of Kharbranth, to\narguing with Dalinar each time he tried to pretend he had a pedestal to stand\nupon. Each time you hired assassins, or you moved people into position\nwho would do what needed to be done, you served me.”\nHe was suddenly closer. So close to her, all she could see was his terrible\nface. “I will need someone to rule this planet,” he said softly, “as my\nattention shifts toward the greater cosmere. When you are ready, come to\nme.”\n“You can’t leave,” she snarled. “You are locked here.”\n“Which is perfect,” he whispered. “The other gods will think me\ncontained, and I will have a chance to build up my resources and my\ninfrastructure. There are three habitable planets in this system. If you knew\nthe things I could do with them … but that will have to wait. If you wish to\nsee what happens when I launch my full armies in a few centuries, come to\nme. I will make you Fused, and therefore immortal.”\n“Never,” she hissed.\n“Never?” he said. “Still lying, I see. You really think there is no chance\nyou will see the value of entering my service?” He somehow loomed even\ncloser. “What is the greater good, Jasnah? Dying in obscurity, or becoming\nimmortal and working for centuries to influence me to treat people better?”\nShe worked her mouth, but she could not say the words. Could not refute\nhim, because one of her cardinal values was that she would not lie to\nherself. She hated that she had to consider the offer, but she did. To reject it\nout of hand would be foolish, and she was …\nWell, she’d assumed she was not a fool.\nAnd so, for the second time in one day, Taravangian left her broken and\ndefeated.\nWithin the hour, news reached her: the nation had voted—by near-"

The dawning of the tenth day was\napproaching. Dalinar was still trapped in the Spiritual Realm.\nAnd Wit thought they shouldn’t do anything.\n“If Odium was interfering with your visions,” Wit said, leaning forward\nas he sat on his couch, hands clasped before him, “then he likely was with\nDalinar’s as well. In fact, we can be certain he is interfering right now. He\nwas the reason you lost contact with one another.”\n“How can you be sure it counts, Wit?” Navani asked, pacing. “Frankly,\nyou’ve been wrong about this contract before.”\nNews from the battlefronts was eminently discouraging. Even if they did\nwin back Alethkar, they’d end up losing far more. She couldn’t … couldn’t\nhonestly say she wouldn’t make that trade, considering how many of the\nother monarchs had given in to Odium’s demands. As long as she had\nJasnah, as long as Adolin and Renarin survived …\n“I can’t be sure I’m right,” Wit admitted. “But while you were checking\non Gavinor I asked my contact on Yolen for her read, and she agrees.\nOdium severing your Connection to Dalinar, isolating the two of you,\nwould count as interfering with Dalinar’s reaching the meeting on time. The\ncontract explicitly indicates this would mean a forfeit.”\n“So if Dalinar doesn’t make it,” Navani said, “we win?”\n“Yes.”\n“So either Odium has to make absolutely certain Dalinar arrives, or …”\n“Or …” Wit continued, grim. “Or Odium thinks what he’s gaining in\nplaying with Dalinar is worth the price of forfeiting Alethkar.”\nThat possibility horrified her.\nThey were the only people in the room. There were no other monarchs to\nlook to for support. Fen had betrayed them, as had the Emuli and the others\nin the once-unified Azish empire. Yanagawn fought alongside Adolin in a\ncity on the verge of falling, and Jasnah was still in Thaylen City. Her\nterseness about when she’d return indicated she was taking her failure\npoorly.\nFor now, Navani was alone. She and Wit. She … was so very tired."

It\nfelt as if she hadn’t slept in days, and given the strange nature of the\nSpiritual Realm, she wasn’t certain that she had.\n“I think Odium will be sure Dalinar returns,” he said. “Considering who\nhe once was.”\n“Excuse me?” she asked, fingers at her temples, trying to massage away\na headache.\n“Ah, right. You wouldn’t know,” Wit said. “Odium’s new Vessel is\nTaravangian.”\nSleep fled.\nNavani stood bolt upright. “Taravangian is dead. We found his body.”\n“A body,” Wit said, “nearly completely consumed by Nightblood. A husk\nthat could have been anyone. In this case, it was almost certainly what\nremained of my old friend Rayse.”\nNavani tried to sort through the implications. “Is this … good for us?\nTaravangian was … almost a friend.”\nWit looked away.\n“No,” Navani whispered. “An almost-friend knows us too well. Plus,\nTaravangian has already proven that he cares nothing for such bonds.”\n“He cares, and that makes him dangerous,” Wit said. “Navani, Rayse\nwas a horrible human being. One of the worst I’ve ever known. But he was\npredictable, savage, with an extreme sense of self-preservation and a pride\nthat was easy to exploit. Taravangian is …”\n“A catastrophe.”\n“I cannot think of a better, or worse, vessel for Odium. Rayse had\nexperience with the power, which is our only advantage in swapping him\nfor Taravangian. But I fear that in the long run, this … this is very, very\nbad.”\n“He won’t just want to defeat Dalinar,” Navani said. “He’ll want to\nbreak him.”\n“We’ve trapped Odium, one way or another, on Roshar,” Wit said. “For\nRayse, this was an indignity. For Taravangian, this will give him time to get\nused to his powers. He likely doesn’t want to go out into the cosmere yet;\nhe’ll certainly want a powerful general to do that for him. A … near friend.\n“I’d hazard Taravangian cares little for Alethkar … but the soul of your\nhusband, that is his true prize. Dalinar needs to be there so Taravangian can\nwin his oath to follow. I wouldn’t worry about Dalinar returning from the\nSpiritual Realm, Navani. I would worry about which version of him will\nreturn.”\nNavani took that as calmly as she could, and tried to consider this like a\nscholar, despite her fatigue. “If what you say is true, then we should try\neven harder to find Dalinar.”\n“That’s the problem, Navani,” Wit said. “If Odium is taking an active\nrole, risking a loss by forfeit, then you and I are completely out of our\ndepth.

Together we will hope that the man we have all chosen as our\nchampion can resist whoever Odium chooses to be his. Because whatever\nhappens tomorrow, I think that secretly, Dalinar Kholin is both champions.”\nAdolin remembered the Battle of the Tower on the Shattered Plains.\nHe fought the endless waves of singers, ramming his spear into darkness\nbroken by faded stars and red embers. He used his shield as best he could to\nprotect the man to his left, counting on the man—or actually woman—to\nhis right to do the same for him. He tried to give space for the pikes to reach\nacross his shoulders—but those dwindled as people were pulled to fill holes\nin the shield line.\nHe pushed through fatigue and terror, past fatalism into numbness. And\nhe remembered the Tower. Fighting, hopeless, along with his father atop a\nnatural rock wedge, knowing there was no salvation. He’d been wrong then,\nbecause of the valor of Bridge Four. Today, no one was coming.\nHis was a numbness of four levels. Numbness of ear, as he turned off the\npart of him that empathized with the screaming of his fellows as they died.\nNumbness of mind, as he just kept doing what he was doing, muscle\nmemory now completely dominant. Numbness of body, as he felt less like a\nman and more like meat Soulcast into a man’s shape. Thrusting his spear\nand holding his shield with limbs that could not be his, because they were\ntoo sluggish, too heavy, too dead. As if they had already climbed onto the\npyre ahead of him.\nNumbness of soul. Storms. He needed a break. He looked to the sides\nand found he could still feel something: a chill, followed by a terrible sense\nof dread.\nThere were no more soldiers waiting to fill the line. No replacements\ncoming. No more pikes at his back. Every available soldier was plugging\nthis hole, or others.\nThere would be no more breaks. No more rotations. No more rest. Until\nhe fell.\nLast moon was setting.\nHe knew that because he could see it on the other side of the dome. The\nlarge gap they held let him see in, but across the way—hundreds of yards in\nthe distance—the catwalk doors inside the dome were open. Here, the\nenemy fought against frantic defenders on the narrow, elevated ledge\noutside. Their defense must have been as terrible as his.\nRegardless, the gaps let him see straight out at the moon, green and\nsolemn. A figure stepped in front of the moon—holding a brilliant\nShardblade. The last human Shardbearer.\nHe defended alone, unsupported, a silhouette holding firm. In his\nnumbness, Adolin imagined it was him fighting gloriously. It was his Plate,\nand that sealed the illusion in Adolin’s mind. Never in a battle even close to\nas bad as this one had he been without his armor. He couldn’t be this wretch\non the ground with a spear he could hardly grip."

Surrounded, overwhelmed, pulled into the\ndarkness of the dome. That man who should have been Adolin—he didn’t\nknow which armor standby bore the Plate and Blade—could not fight them\nall. Adolin’s shout was lost in the cacophony of battle, then he slipped on\nhis peg. In that moment, Adolin remembered he wasn’t a shining hero.\nToday he was a crippled spearman with barely enough strength to lift his\nshield.\nCheering sounded inside the dome. It was hundreds of yards across, so\nAdolin couldn’t see the details—and he had to focus on his own fight. But\nthat cheering became chants, deliberately in Azish. “The last human falls.\nThe Shards are ours. The last human falls. The Shards are ours!”\nThe sound shook Adolin straight to his heart. Around him, his line\nbuckled further.\n“Hold!” he shouted. But no one was listening. “Hold!”\nHe gripped his shield and used his spear less as a weapon, more as a way\nto try to push back the tide. He screamed and no one replied. Across the\ndome, red eyes flooded out through the gap the Shardbearer had been\nholding.\nThis time no one stopped them.\nAdolin continued to fight. Holding the gap for another eternity,\nscreaming at his soldiers to hold. Until at long last, the enemy ranks in front\nof him parted—and a figure stepped to their forefront. Red eyes shining\nthrough the eye slits of a helm covered in blood. Familiar, terrible laughter.\nGlistening Shardplate—Adolin’s. And a Blade that had once been an\nimperial Azish heirloom.\nAbidi the Monarch had Shards now.\nThe beleaguered shield line shattered around Adolin. The general inside\nhim was surprised they’d held so long—far past what a game of towers said\nthey would. He could not feel angry at them, but in their haste, a faceless\nsoldier shoved him. Adolin tried to turn and stabilize himself, but tripped on\nhis bad leg and went down.\nThe floodgates opened. Singer ranks gushed from the wound in the\ndome, some trampling across him, their officers yelling in Azish for them to\npress the advance, cut down the stragglers, eliminate defenses.\nAdolin curled up, and thought to hide among the dead. It was dark. They\nmight not think to send someone to check the fallen. It happened. Lying\nthere would be smart.\nHe didn’t feel smart. He suddenly felt angry. Because nothing seemed to\nhave a point. He’d loved his father, supported him against the tide of\nbetrayal in Alethkar, only to learn Dalinar had killed Adolin’s mother.\nAdolin had stood trial for all of humankind at Lasting Integrity. For\nwhat? No help, no answers. Moral victories didn’t matter when cities fell\nanyway. He’d always tried to fight for his kingdom and his family, while\nothers played games and murdered in the night—but when he stood up for\nthose he loved, he became a villain? For killing a man who had tried to do\nthe same to him?"

For killing a man who had tried to do\nthe same to him?\nFinally, at long last, he acknowledged it. The cloud that had been chasing\nhim for so many months.\nIf Adolin couldn’t trust his father …\nWhat … what could he trust in?\nIf Dalinar Kholin wasn’t worthy of Adolin’s reverence, where was the\nsense in any of this? Maybe there wasn’t any. Maybe it didn’t mean\nanything.\nMaybe nothing did.\nHe shouted and heaved himself up, no longer numb, but alive with a cold\nsense of fury. Surrounded by figures moving in the darkness—who at first\ndidn’t realize he wasn’t one of them—Adolin yanked the release cord on his\nback and pulled off his longsword. He grabbed it and flung the sheath away\ninto the night, his shield lost, common helmet and breastplate biting into his\nskin. He forced his peg backward into a hole between two cobbles, bracing\nit, and put two hands on the hilt of his sword. Shallan had given him this\none, for their wedding.\nOn this terrible night, chaos flowing around him, Adolin became the\nstone. The man who would not back down. The man who would hold his\nground.\nBecause in the past, the world had always started making sense again\nwhen he stood with sword in hand.\nHe began to fight. One man against a tide of glowing gemstones in\nbeards or on clothing for the femalens. He attacked the first one that\nrecognized him. She turned to raise an axe, and Adolin expertly batted the\nweapon aside, then rammed his sword straight into her eye. As that one fell,\nhe swung at the next, separating arm from body.\nA sword was not commonly the best weapon for this kind of fighting—\nbetter an axe or mace against carapace. However, if the sword was part of\nyou, that changed—because singers tended to rely on their carapace. To\nexpect it would protect them—when in reality it had plenty of chinks,\nplenty of holes.\nAdolin did not dance. A duel was a dance. This was not something\nbeautiful, and he was no poet. This was a man, a fallen city, and anger\nculminating in blood to spill. First theirs, then his.\nFor he knew this was the night he’d die. At least he could go down\nfighting.\nAdolin … Maya.\nNo. He did not summon her.\nWhy?\nHe did not want her to see him fall. The city was lost, and he … he felt\nashamed.\nNo shame in loss … she whispered.\nI failed Kholinar.\nNever shame in loss …\nI failed you. Father. Everyone.\nNever. I AM COMING.\nHe ignored her and kept fighting. He brought down eight singers before\none landed a real hit on him, a spear to the back of his good leg, right\nthrough the opening of the greave. His calf burned with pain as he grunted\nand spun on his peg, slapping away the spear and then driving his sword\nthrough the neck of the singer.

Another slammed an axe into\nhis side, and he knew that was the blow that would do it. Numb though his\nbody was to pain, he had fought enough to recognize that sensation of blood\nsaturating armor, warming his skin.\nAnother swept that cursed peg out from under him, and he went down,\nwedding sword clanging from his numb fingers, lost into the night. And as\nhe lay there, he was still angry. Because for the first time in his life, the\nsword hadn’t brought him peace or answers.\nHe couldn’t trust in his father any longer. But as a singer stood above\nhim—with halberd raised to ram down—Adolin found he wanted to.\nHe wanted to find a way to love his father again. He wanted to make\npeace. He wanted a chance.\n“Not yet!” he screamed. “Not until I see him again!” He kicked the\nsinger in the knee with his peg. She stumbled.\nThen an arrow took her in the eye.\nA flood of arrows followed, forcing enemies nearby to fall back. Adolin\ntwisted, seeing a small enclave of defenders with archers at the front. The\nsingers … the battle lines had fallen and they didn’t have enough discipline\n… which hurt them here … They could make a powerful, mad rush, but\nreorienting to an enemy position was …\nStorms, it was hard to think …\n“There!” Colot’s voice said as he dashed from among May and her\narchers. “I’ve found him.”\n“Leave me,” Adolin croaked, numb.\n“Can you stand?” Colot asked, reaching him.\n“Leave me.”\n“Storm that,” Colot said.\n“Leave—”\n“Look,” Colot said, leaning down and looming large in the night. “You\nsee that man holding a lantern near May? That’s the storming emperor. He\nrefused to leave until we came for you. May, fortunately, saw you in the line\nearlier. You hear me, Adolin? Yanagawn will not leave until you are with us.\nSo get to your storming feet, or let that boy die.”\nThey locked eyes, and storm him, Colot was right. And storm it, Adolin\nneeded to see his father at least one more time. He let Colot help him stand.\nA moment later Hmask was there under his other arm. They stumbled away\nfrom the dome and met up with Yanagawn amid his soldiers. Would they\nsuffer Gezamal’s fate for letting the emperor put himself in danger? The\nidea made Adolin, groggy, chuckle. How many latrine attendants did they\nneed in the fallen city?\nBecause it had fallen. Adolin paused to look it over, held upright by his\nfriends, and saw enemy soldiers in every direction. They didn’t set the city\non fire, the way human conquerors would have. They wanted to rule, and\nsome of the singers fighting to claim Azimir had lived here as parshmen.

They\npicked up some enemies—singer officers who were able to get some troops\nto give chase. Fortunately, the defenders had a protocol for this. Adolin and\nthe emperor were shut in a room with a few defenders while others made it\nseem like they had all escaped through the back doors.\nAfter that, it was a quick run—well, a limping, exhausted, beleaguered\ntrot—through several buildings all built against one another, until they\nreached the saferoom door. Adolin suffered it in a daze, and didn’t fully\ncome alert until coldness washed through him.\nHe blinked, and found himself on the floor of the saferoom, bloodied,\nwith Rahel the teenage Truthwatcher kneeling beside him. He noted others\nthere: the emperor, some soldiers, many of the wounded who had been\nmoved into this bunker instead of left in the hospital.\nHow … how much time had he lost? He groaned, lying there, as the\nhealing hadn’t done anything for his fatigue. At least the numbness was\nreturning. The numbness of utter loss. He saw it in the faces of everyone\ndown here with him: Colot, May, Yanagawn—even Kushkam, who was\nnursing a wound of his own, his face bloodied, barely healed as they could\nspare Regrowth for only the worst cases.\nAdolin was glad to see the other general, but the look they shared was\ndemoralizing.\nThe city had fallen. And with it the empire.\nAzir was no more.\nTHE END OF\nDay Nine\nDieno, the Mink, did not think highly of the means by which he was to be\nexecuted.\n“Surely,” he said, hands tied behind his back as he lay with his head\nagainst the headsman’s block, “you can think of something better than this.”\nLike most of the soldiers in the courtyard below, the judiciary who led\nthe execution was Herdazian. She wore a robe that tied to one shoulder,\nwith singer markings on it, and was accompanied by a squad of bulky\nwarforms. Dieno had seen this multiple times: a conqueror often put some\nenterprising local in charge. It let the people pretend they had some\nsemblance of self-rule. All you needed was a traitor or two.\n“Tie me to a boulder and launch me into the ocean with a catapult,”\nDieno said, his face pressed against the wood. “Now that would be\nsomething. If you’re feeling spicy, you could throw me from a tower and\nsee how many archers could hit me before I land. Good target practice,\nthat.”\nThe judiciary actually paused, seeming to consider, before one of the\nsinger minders shoved her on the shoulder. So she continued reading\nDieno’s crimes.\nA beheading? Really? What an indignity. Dieno sighed, glad his crimes\nhad been so exhaustive, as it gave him time to plan. There was always a\nway out.\nThough … this situation was looking rough.\nHe’d had the Windrunners land his people a couple days’ march from the\nHerdazian capital.

Getting too close would have put everyone on alert. After\nthat, he’d led his troops through a series of caves he’d played in as a child,\nones that traveled underground and came up close to the city.\nIt had been a brilliant plan. He’d been quite proud of it. It would have\nbeen wonderful if they hadn’t run into a series of cave-ins.\nIn the years since he’d played here, the caves had become unstable.\nEverstorm, likely. He hadn’t accounted for that, and his troops had been\nliterally stonewalled three times trying to navigate the caverns. Eventually\nthey’d been forced to come out and cross an open field of stone.\nThe moon had emerged at just the wrong moment. It seemed fate itself\nhad turned on him. An entire army had mobilized against them—and what\nhad been planned as a glorious rescue had ended last night. He hadn’t even\nreached the city.\nThey’d brought his troops and him to an outpost by the ocean, well away\nfrom the capital. Herdaz was not going to be saved by him; he’d have to\nhope for Dalinar and his contest. Dieno himself might not even see the hour\narrive, unless …\n“Hey,” he shouted, “could you at least use a mallet?”\nThey paused again.\n“A … mallet?” the judiciary asked.\n“Sure. Smash my head,” Dieno said. “Instead of just cut it off. All these\npeople came to watch. You need to give them something worth witnessing.”\n“A mallet would be incredibly painful,” the judiciary said.\n“But a better story,” Dieno said. “Come on. I’m a legend. You can’t have\na legend dying by a mere beheading, can you? Singers. You talk about\npassion and song. Well, we need a better song today if Dieno the Mink is\ngoing to die.”\nTheir humming changed. Mention passion, and it sometimes worked for\nthem.\n“Do we … have a mallet?” the judiciary asked.\nThere. The headsman looked away from Dieno to reply. There. Shouldn’t\nhave taken his eyes off his charge.\n“I don’t have one,” the headsman said. “But—”\nDieno slipped the ropes from his wrists with a couple of quick\ncontortions. A second later, he yanked the chain around his neck—in the\nhands of a headsman’s assistant—and threw the boy off balance. Dieno hit\nhim a second later, shoving him from the execution platform.\nThe crowd cheered, which shocked those on the podium. Yes, the\naudience of gathered soldiers were ostensibly on their side—Herdazians\nand singers who served the invaders. But Dieno was certain every person\nhad come expecting to have a story to tell at the end. He would see them\nhave a proper finale, one way or another.\nThe Mink would not fall to a headsman. Indeed, the man lifted his axe\nand swung, but Dieno was yanked out of the way—and completely off the\nexecution platform—by the falling man who still held his chain. Dieno\ncame down on top of the youth, heard something crack in his chest, and\nbounced free."

Dieno\ncame down on top of the youth, heard something crack in his chest, and\nbounced free.\nDieno patted him on the cheek. “Broken ribs. Three months’ bed rest,\nlad. Spend it thinking about how you’ve chosen to side with the enemy.” He\npulled the chain free of the groaning youth’s hands, then swung it up and\nused it to block the attack of the singer guards charging for him.\nHe escaped under the wooden platform itself. It had been erected to give\nthe courtyard a good view of his death, but the narrow confines of the\nwooden beams down here blocked the warforms in their bulky,\nunremovable armor, while Dieno … well, he could get through almost any\ngap.\nChaos and shouting followed him as he slipped out near some steps up\nonto the fort’s wall. Other exits were blocked, but perhaps he could find a\nway to hop off it to safety. He reached the top, but found soldiers on every\nside, advancing. He looked across the ocean, shrouded in mist, the moon\nrising on the last evening before the contest.\nThere was no place to jump. He was trapped at last. Dieno steeled\nhimself, hoping they had their bows ready to give it a good show, and\nclimbed onto the top of the battlement. It was fifty feet to the stones below.\nEscaping today had been a frail hope anyway. You couldn’t stay ahead of\nthe wind forever. Not even someone like him. He’d given Herdaz his all,\nbut how many times could your heart break for a kingdom before your soul\nbled out? He quietly acknowledged that he’d done all he could, then\nprepared to jump.\nA thumping shook the ground and made him pause. Behind, guards and\nsoldiers reaching to seize him stopped short. The wall trembled, the ground\nboomed.\nA greatshell the size of a city emerged from the darkened fog, big\nenough to tower over the entire fort.\n“Well now,” Dieno said. “That’s a finale.”\nCould he destroy the power of Honor?\nOdium considered this, perhaps too long. The power was protecting\nDalinar. If he attacked it, he might be able to get at his friend. A smaller part\nof him dealt with other rats in the walls, keeping them occupied—trying to\nbreak them—though he could not spare them much attention.\nHe watched the permutations, and found them clouded. He couldn’t\ncompletely destroy the power of Honor, as power could not be destroyed,\nbut there were options. His predecessor had done it several ways. First, by\nimprisoning the power of two Shards in the Cognitive Realm, which had\nproved cataclysmic and made it very difficult to access the land. Then by\nattacking a Shard outright, an action which had left him wounded and had\n—in the clash—destroyed planets.\nOdium thought maybe he could Splinter this power, spreading it out,\npreventing it from congealing into something that could resist him. It was\nsomething his predecessor had avoided, however, because of the threat to\nhimself. To clash with Honor’s power would violate his oath not to strike\nfirst against the other Shard, and would leave him vulnerable to an assault\nfrom Cultivation."

Each choice grew too haughty, too eager for immortality or\npower. The Stormfather feared each would eventually go to war with\nOdium and destroy the world.\nLast of all, he showed Gavilar. Dalinar watched with a sinking feeling.\nHe’d tried so hard to pretend he didn’t hear the way Navani spoke of\nGavilar, the way the Stormfather referenced him. The way the facts of\nGavilar’s life hadn’t added up to the sum Dalinar had always imagined.\nIt was a final daunting revelation. More personal. Equally terrible.\nGavilar Kholin had brought about his own demise.\n“I can’t trust someone who wants the power, Dalinar,” the Stormfather\nsaid through tears, his frail, emaciated form held in Dalinar’s arms.\n“Whoever takes the power could attack Odium, which is what our enemy\nultimately wants, as it would free his anger to destroy. I need someone who\nhas held power and not become a tyrant.”\nForced to shake off the revelation of his brother’s true nature, Dalinar\npicked apart the unspoken part of the Stormfather’s words. The power of\nHonor, if given the choice, would circumvent the contest of champions—\nthen destroy the planet.\n“That’s why you’re wrong too,” the Stormfather mumbled. “The real\nTanavast might have done better than I have in picking. I don’t think\nenough like a man. I clearly never should have chosen you, but the wounds\nyou bore …”\n“They mirror your own,” Dalinar whispered. “Those of a god who\nfailed.” He felt the weight of his own failures. The corpses he had created.\nThe people he had let down.\nHe’d always stubbornly insisted he was right. Momentum. His life had\nbeen about momentum. Problem was, it was all too easy to gather\nmomentum in the wrong direction, and it became harder and harder to\nchange course.\n“I kept hope,” the Stormfather said, “that he could be defeated by a\nchampion …”\n“I don’t share that hope,” Dalinar said. “He was able to outmaneuver\nTanavast, who knew him well.

Men have had a fool for a god for so very long\n…”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “We’ve done the greater good here. Whatever\nhappens at the contest, Odium remains locked away—and cannot go into\nthe cosmere to destroy. That was Tanavast’s goal, and Wit’s goal.”\n“It was … wasn’t it?” the Stormfather said, blinking. “I … I did manage\nthat.

Thousands of years of\nwar, engaged in proxy battles, as Odium trained armies on Roshar—hoping\nfor some way to someday escape. How much sorrow had been perpetuated\nhere, to protect people and worlds Dalinar had never seen?\nDalinar stood, within the current vision of a small, dark monastery\nchamber for the mentally troubled.

He\nhad similar features to Tanavast, but was less lean, with stronger eyebrows,\na more prominent nose. Brothers, not identical twins.\n“So what do we do?” Dalinar said. “Yes, he’s trapped on this world—but\nthat’s not an ultimate solution. Tanavast’s visions prove that throughout\nhistory, people—human, Herald, god—have avoided dealing with Odium.\nThey kicked the problem to the next generation. Each Desolation, merely\nstalling. Other deities out in the sky somewhere, content to let him remain\nsomeone else’s duty. Even Tanavast’s final confrontation, where he fled and\ngave his memories to you, pushed the problem off to someone else.\n“My contract threatens to do the same. Peace on Roshar, until he\nprovokes a war by making us attack him. He used the same tactic again—a\npromise he would not attack, which left his opponent free to strike. Because\nit lets others break their oaths, and protects him from repercussions.”\n“It will happen,” the Stormfather agreed, his rumbling voice becoming\nmore familiar and stormlike. “Tanavast’s peace is a sham, Dalinar. When\nOdium wishes to conquer this land, he will find a way to provoke your\ncoalition to attack him, giving justification for war.”\n“He can’t be merely locked away or appeased,” Dalinar whispered.\n“Someone has to destroy him.”\n“You cannot fight!” the Stormfather said, his voice rumbling louder now.\n“Dalinar, you—”\n“I know,” he said. “Peace. I know.” Still …\nBlood of my fathers, Dalinar thought, pacing in the small room. How do\nyou defeat someone too powerful to fight, yet too crafty and dangerous to\nlock away?\n“I have to win this contest,” Dalinar said. “Yet I feel that no matter what\nI do, he’ll play me for one of the ten fools.” He stopped pacing and looked\nat the Stormfather. “The power is here? This place? The visions?”\n“Yes,” the Stormfather said. “Here and everywhere. It watches us, trying\nto understand us. Different from other similar powers, as it has been alone\nfor thousands of years. It grows more self-aware, as I did in the storm, and\nit studies humankind. It’s also the very substance of these walls, this\nground, this sky.”\nDalinar considered, then resumed his pacing.\n“Dalinar,” the Stormfather said, “holding the power will not let you win.\nThat cannot beat Odium.”\n“Then what will?” Dalinar said, frustrated. “You led me to this, when all"

I lived as that storm for so long, my soul\nshaped by the prayers of the humans beneath. I forgot what it was to be\nalive, and you reminded me, sometimes through force. Because of you, I\nremember and understand Tanavast’s mercy and pity. I recognize the need\nto change, and … I find myself not so bitter about what Tanavast did at the\nend. Ultimately, I am as you’ve known me. Not a friend perhaps, but a\ncompanion.”\nDalinar nodded. He then held his hands to the sides and tried to accept\nthe power of Honor. He could feel it, watching.\nIt rejected him. N . H .\nO UMANS BREAK OATHS\nDalinar sighed, opening his eyes. At least he had more information now.\nIn his younger years all he’d wanted to do was march onto a battlefield and\nfind an opponent, but he’d come to realize the essential military value of a\nlittle knowledge. Wars were won not by hotheads with swords, but by cool\nminds who could position those hotheads.\nDalinar had context for his clash with Odium. He’d seen the creature’s\nhistory, and knew how he thought. Except there was a wrinkle.\n“Odium is not Rayse any longer,” Dalinar said. “Taravangian took his\nplace.”\n“I fear the power, Dalinar, more than Taravangian. I fear Honor as well.\nThese powers were not meant to be held in isolation—each of them is\nwarped or distorted without the others.” The Stormfather moved closer. “I\nfind myself glad it is you going to this conflict, Dalinar.”\n“Why?” Dalinar asked, his hands spread. “I am no better than Tanavast. I\nburned cities, I murdered.”\n“Perhaps,” the Stormfather said. “But you took the next step, Dalinar,\nwhen I hid.” His eyes became distant. “I hid. I wept. I pretended I didn’t\ncare, because that was the path that seemed the least painful …”\nThis creature. Dalinar took a deep breath and tried to contain his\nfrustration. All this time, he’d been bonded to someone who could have\nexplained the truth. But … storms. If Evi could forgive Dalinar …\n“I forgive you,” Dalinar forced himself to say.\nThe Stormfather looked at him.\n“You have always been clear with me on one point,” Dalinar said. “You\nare a storm, not a human, and even with a piece of Tanavast in you … it is\nunreasonable for me to expect you to act as a human being would. You\ntried. And that piece of you that is Tanavast? Well, many would have"

Well, many would have\nburned this planet down in order to prove themselves right. He ran, but I’ve\nknown plenty of soldiers who lacked the bravery to run when they should\nhave. So I forgive you, and I forgive Tanavast. I’m just one person, and I\ncan’t absolve you of anything … but I can forgive you. Come, let’s find\nNavani and Gav, then get back.” He hesitated. “Unless …”\n“There is time,” the Stormfather said. “Some little remains before your\ncontest. But Dalinar … do you mean what you said? You forgive me?”\n“I’m trying,” Dalinar said, as honestly as he could. “Can we leave,\nplease? I’ve seen enough.”\n“I shall send you out.”\n“Navani first,” Dalinar said. “And Gav.”\n“They are home already. Navani brought them by using her bond to the\nSibling. But … your son is here, and the Lightweaver, along with one\nsinger.”\n“Adolin?”\n“The other. The one who sees.”\n“Renarin and Shallan,” he said with surprise. “Take me to them.”\n“They hide from gods,” the Stormfather said. “Odium cannot find them,\nand so I have no hope of doing so. They came by choice, I think.”\nDalinar considered. “Send me back. Once I’ve done what I need to, I’ll\nfind a way to get them out.”\nA portal of light opened. Dalinar stepped through it, and walked at long\nlast from memory into the present.\n“The Shattered Plains have fallen to the enemy,” Kaminah the scribe said\nquietly, reading from her spanreed conversation. “And Thaylenah has\nsigned a deal with Odium, as Emul and the others did.”\nThe small group of officers at one corner of the packed saferoom all\ngrew silent. Adolin hung his head, sitting on the floor, his back to the wall.\nHe felt like a leaf after the highstorm was finished with it, every muscle\nsore, head pounding, leg—the missing one—aching enough to draw a\nsomewhat confused-looking painspren.\nIf the Shattered Plains—where they’d stationed most of their Radiants—\nwas unable to stand … what chance had Azir ever had?\n“Traitors,” Noura spat, sitting beside Adolin. “We bled and died on\nEmuli and Thaylen stone. And they just make a deal? Betraying us?”\n“We dominated Emul for centuries,” Yanagawn said, so out of place in\nhis ornate robes among all of them who were—save the few viziers and\nscions—bloodied, exhausted, beaten down. “We continuously claimed\nimperial authority over them, forced them to playact being part of our\nempire. You are surprised they now take the chance to be rid of us?”\n“They serve the enemy!”\n“They trade one tyrant for another,” Yanagawn said. He seemed\nswallowed in his finery, his eyes haunted—and he sounded as exhausted as\nAdolin felt. “Maybe Odium gave them better terms than we did. Who\nknows? I wish them the best.

Resisting didn’t help us—and now we are\ndominated without having a deal in place to protect our people.”\nThe group fell still. Again. Silence had come in fits and waves, like\nmoonlight on a cloudy night, since the city’s fall a few hours ago. Adolin\nneeded sleep, yet his mind wouldn’t stop racing. For the second time he’d\nwatched a city fall, with his greatest efforts proving useless.\nBeing the Blackthorn’s son hadn’t been enough. Being Adolin hadn’t\nbeen enough. What was left?\nHe clung to one shred of light. When as he’d been about to die, he’d\nrealized he needed to make peace with his father, needed to believe such a\nreconciliation was possible.\nHe was so tired. So worn. So broken. Yet something within him felt …\nlike a sword on an anvil.\nIf Dalinar Kholin of all people could find forgiveness and hope … can’t I\ndo so as well?\n“Windrunners will be here soon,” May said from where she sat, quietly\nwriting on scraps of paper—drawing out towers pieces for the emperor,\nwho had mentioned he wished they had a deck to pass the time. “The squire\nI’m writing to says they’ve landed outside the city. They’ll wait for things\nto die down, then sneak in and find us. Notum has already met up with\nthem.”\n“How many Windrunners?” Kushkam said.\n“Two full ones, a handful of squires,” May said.\n“Time?” Adolin said, his voice hoarse.\nNoura checked her pocket fabrial watch. “Three hours until your father’s\ndeadline.”\n“What if we do something?” Yanagawn asked. They’d given him a\npillow, the only “furniture” in the room. He perched atop it like a chicken\non her nest in one of the picture books from Adolin’s youth.\n“Do something?” Noura asked. “Like what, Majesty?”\nHe sighed and took off his massive headpiece to wipe his brow. He\nseemed so young, so small without it. “We have three hours, Noura. We\ncould … I don’t know. Gather what we have left, try to fight?”\nAdolin scanned the room, taking stock. Kushkam, who was missing\nthree fingers on one hand now, and had a cut across his face that had barely\nscabbed over. Adolin, in the shape he was in. Gezamal had survived and\nwas here. He’d reportedly been the one who got his father to safety. He\nlooked relatively unscathed.\nAdd to them a handful of the emperor’s guards, Colot, May, and a few of\nAdolin’s men including Hmask. The other wounded—maybe thirty—who\nthey’d moved here were in even worse shape than Adolin. None of them\ncould stand, let alone mount a resistance.\nSomeone had to say it. Someone Yanagawn would listen to.\n“There’s nothing we can do, Majesty,” Adolin said softly. “I’m sorry.”\nYanagawn looked down, huddling in his robes.\nOne of Colot’s guards stepped up—Sarqqin, the Azish blacksmith who"

The room wasn’t supposed to hold this many.”\n“The rest of us will need to surrender,” Noura said softly, “once the\nemperor and Brightlord Adolin have been flown to safety.”\n“They may execute you, Noura,” Yanagawn said. “The singers\nsometimes execute the leadership of a conquered town. Too many highborn\nhave caused problems after being subjugated. You will be in danger, and so\nwhen I leave, you will leave with me.”\nShe sighed. “As you wish, Majesty.”\nAdolin lay back again, in an attempt to get a little sleep. Wondering\nabout his father, missing Shallan, and trying to banish that little sliver of\nlight inside him that had started whispering.\nSecond chance, Adolin. You’ve been given a second chance. You know\nwhat your father did with his. What will you do with yours?\nSzeth slowly helped Nin-son-God into the bed of the wagon. The old\nvehicle groaned beneath his weight as Nin lay down, his head toward the\nfront seats. Kaladin slid the bundle of swords in next to him. Eight\nHonorblades and one pitch-black sword, locked in a silvery sheath.\nOoh! Nightblood said. A chariot! Is this a chariot? You got me a\nchariot?\nSzeth smiled, then looked to the couple who stood in the barn nearby,\nholding candles for light. “Thank you.”\n“Thank you, Honorbearer,” the wife said. “For the distinction of letting\nus aid one of Truth.”\nThey seemed good people, both wearing their splashes brightly, living on\ntheir own, away from city or town—reminding him of his own family.\nPerhaps that was why they hadn’t been touched by the evils.\nSzeth walked over and handed them a couple of broams, now drained of\nStormlight. “The gemstones in these were grown in the hearts of beasts, not\ncleaved from stone. They have great value.”\nPlainly dubious, the man glanced at his wife—who nodded after a brief\npause—and took the two ruby broams. They were familiar with money,\neven if this was different from the iridescent coins made from greatshell\ncarapace by the mint.\nSzeth took the two old horses the couple had offered and hitched them to\nthe front of the wagon in the early-morning darkness. It had been years\nsince he’d done this, but the process returned to him easily.\nKaladin and Syl stood watching him with some measure of awe or\nconfusion.\n“What?” Szeth asked.\nKaladin cleared his throat. “Are those horses all right? They, um, look\n…”\n“They’re so small!” Syl said. “Are these kid horses?”\n“They’re not child horses,” Szeth said, smiling. He patted one of them.\n“This one is a senior, actually.

In Shinovar, we have more breeds of horses than you can\nimagine.”\nHe climbed up into the front of the wagon, where Kaladin and Syl joined\nhim, and he waved to his spren, haunting the shadows with the whispers.\nThe creature hesitantly moved into the wagon bed in human shape. He sat\nby Nin.\nWith a shake of the reins, they were off. Pulling slowly out of the barn\nand across a land soaked by ordinary rain. They had a chest full of infused\ngemstones in the wagon, recovered from Nin’s stash, and were maybe two\nhours’ ride from the Bondsmith monastery.\nThey’d talked about flying straight there. But both wanted to preserve\nStormlight, and maybe prepare themselves. “And so,” Szeth said, “we begin\nour final charge toward destiny. Riding in an old wagon. Seems\nappropriate.”\n“Appropriate how?” Kaladin asked.\n“When this began for you,” Szeth said as they rolled through a puddle\nwith a bounce and a splash, “was it in a throne room? On a battlefield? Did\nyou begin your journey soaring in the sky?”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “It started in a little town, far from anywhere\nimportant.”\n“My journey started among the sheep.”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said, nodding.\n“Yeah,” Syl added. Then after a pause, “My journey did start in a throne\nroom, admittedly.”\n“What?” Kaladin asked, glancing at her sitting on—well, hovering about\nan inch above—the wooden seat next to him, full sized and wearing her\nuniform.\n“Yup!” she said. “I poofed into existence, fully formed by the\nStormfather, right in the middle of the Godforge—which is basically his\nthrone room.” She eyed Szeth and Kaladin. “It was far more elegant than\nthe way you humans are born.”\nSzeth leaned back, enjoying how oddly relaxing it was to be sitting here,\nmoving toward his final confrontation but not worrying about it. “Do I want\nto know,” Szeth said, his eyes on the road, “how she found out about the\ncreation of new humans?”\n“I’m very inquisitive,” Syl said.\n“She’s nosy,” Kaladin said.\n“I ask questions.”\n“She interrogates people.”\n“I did not interrogate Monosha,” Syl said, folding her arms. “We’re\nfriends.”\n“A midwife,” Kaladin explained at Szeth’s questioning look. “Once\nshowed her puppies being born.”\n“Wouldn’t take me to the birth of a human,” Syl said. “Had to sneak into\nthat one.”\n“You are …” a voice said from behind them, “not what I imagined.”\nSzeth peered over his shoulder to where Nin lay, wrapped in his blanket,\ngazing at the sky. “Can you tell me what to expect?” Szeth asked. “From\nthis next part?”\n“Ishar will want to see you humbled,” Nin said softly. “You have\ndefeated each Honorbearer, but he says that while a Herald must be\naccomplished, he cannot be arrogant.

Only that you are expected to fail it.”\n“And if Szeth gains Ishar’s approval,” Kaladin said, “he’ll be made a\nHerald?”\n“Yes,” Nin whispered, his voice frail, even sickly. “I … now that I see\nbetter, I question this plan. Much of what Ishar has done these last centuries\n—these last years in particular—is … unsettling to me. Trying to build an\narmy of physical spren and Fused, preparing for far-distant conflicts. I fear\nwhat drinking of Odium’s power did to him. That troubles me deeply now. I\ndo not know why it didn’t before.”\n“Like I’ve been saying,” Syl said, “we don’t need Heralds anymore.\nEven if you lock the enemy away on Braize, they can get here via the\nEverstorm. The whole system is broken.”\n“Maybe …” Nin said, “that was our mistake.”\nSzeth glanced back at him. “Mistake?”\n“We were so much more than locks upon Fused souls. We were leaders\nonce. Teachers. What if we’d stayed on Roshar … and taught? Not to betray\nTaln, but to build up science, society? What if …” He shook his head. “I\nthink the world could very well still use Heralds, Ancient Daughter. Just …\nnot the ones it has …”\nHe trailed off. And together they rode in silence beneath that highway of\nspren light in the sky—pointed toward destiny.\nI know that to this day, people are confused by how at the end,\nspren began arriving in the East without the need for bonds.\nNotum, now among the most famous of honorspren, is an\nexample.

There was meaning in that, wasn’t\nthere? Or was he just reacting against his earlier lack of emotion. He knew\nhe was exhausted, and maybe not rational, but in the end—when he’d been\nabout to die—it wasn’t honor Adolin had felt, but fatalism. That terrified\nhim.\nAdolin Kholin had no purpose. He hadn’t had one since the day of the\nRadiants had dawned.\nYou’ve been here helping all this time, Maya said. Her voice was\nstronger. She was close now.\nSo?\nSo you’ve always had a purpose.\nI’m not enough, though.\nGood! she replied.\nGood? he thought, shocked.\nYes. Because … She took a mental breath, and he could feel this much\ntalking remained difficult for her.

The lighteyes rarely\nspoke that way these days, even if his father did. Maya was from another\ntime though—a time when religion had been different.\nA short while later, Adolin heard the door to the basement saferoom slip\nopen. That set them all on edge, until Notum zipped down. A group of\npeople followed, cloaks obscuring their Windrunner uniforms.\n“Skar?” Adolin said, standing. “Drehy?”\nThe two Windrunners were followed by five squires. The last quickly\nshut the door.\nAdolin stood and limped over to the two familiar Radiants, one tall and\none short, who were surveying the room, their expressions grim.\n“Went about as well for you as it did us, eh?” Skar asked.\n“That bad?” Adolin asked.\n“It was a storming mess,” Drehy said. “Enemy threw everything they\nhad at the Shattered Plains, Everstorm included. We lost a lot of people,\nHighness. Good people. Sigzil is down, alive but without a spren. Leyten\nand Deti are dead. I don’t feel like we ever had a chance.”\n“Did anyone hold any of the battlefields?” Adolin asked. “What about\nthe Mink, and Herdaz?”\n“Last we’d heard,” Drehy said, “they didn’t even make it in time. They\ngot bogged down fighting to reach the capital.”\n“Brightness Jasnah was right,” Skar said. “That excursion was of the ten\nfools.”\n“Looks like our entire defense was of the ten fools,” Drehy said. “We\nfailed on every storming front.”\n“Unless my father wins,” Adolin said. “Then we get Herdaz and\nAlethkar back, regardless.”\nThe two nodded, but seemed grim.

So I’m not leaving, Noura,\nnot as long as there is hope.”\n“What hope can there be?” she asked.\n“As long …” Adolin whispered from his seat by the wall. “As long as\nthe emperor is on his throne …”\n“Azir stands,” Yanagawn said. “The fifth dynasty troubles, Noura. You\ntaught me of them, when two rival emperors fought for the city. In a\ndisputed city, the one who holds the throne physically has legitimacy.”\n“An impossible chance,” Noura said. “The enemy will fill the palace—\neven if they don’t know about that precedent, they’ll be searching for you,\nfor our riches. That location will have one of the highest troop\nconcentrations in the city. We’ll never get in.”\nSomething sparked in Adolin.\nThat light. He realized and recognized it right before Yanagawn spoke.\n“If only,” the young emperor said, a hint of awe in his voice, “we had\nsomeone to lead us who had experience sneaking into the palace.”\nStorms. Adolin blinked, then forced himself to stand on foot and peg.\nYanagawn’s origin … was as a thief who had infiltrated the Azish palace\nwith Lift so long ago.\n“This is why,” Adolin whispered, meeting the emperor’s eyes. “Why you\nare here. This … means something.”\n“What’s this?” Drehy asked. “I’m lost. Are we leaving or not?”\n“No, we aren’t,” Adolin said. “Because Yanagawn is going to sneak us\ninto the palace, where he and I will seize the throne room and save this\nstorming city.”\nLight coalesced around Dalinar, then he appeared in his rooms in Urithiru.\nHe was home.

What happened in there?”\n“The visions tried to replicate you and found it impossible.”\nWit smiled.\n“Please don’t let that pad your ego,” Dalinar said. “Wit, did you know\nthe Stormfather held Tanavast’s memories?”\n“He’s a kind of off-white, half-finished version of his Cognitive\nShadow,” Wit said, with a nod. “A … replica of Tanavast, maybe an avatar,\nthat had taken on its own will.”\n“With his memories.

You have around two hours remaining. I told\nher you’d appear in your rooms, but she was hesitant to come down in case\nyou appeared elsewhere and went looking for her.”\n“You knew I’d be here?

Listen, it whispered. Listen.\n“Now, the king of that land was a good man,” Wit continued. “I rather\nliked him, for all his faults. One day, he started pondering the nature of\nnobility. He had a discussion with his lords—though on this planet, it was\nnot the color of the eyes that marked nobility. They claimed it was about\nbirth, naturally: the acts of god, the sanctity of the crown.

Everyone conveniently neglects to tell the lower\nclass that it’s their coin, and their lack of swords.\n“Regardless, the king had listened to the wrong kind of philosophers.\nThe kind who spoke of concepts like the innate equality of all people. He\nbegan wondering about the flimsy rationalizations given for elevating one\nperson above another, and he got into an argument with his lords.\n“It was a foolish argument, with some measure of wine involved. The\nking claimed he could take any lowborn child in the land and raise him to\nbe as noble, to be as learned and talented as any highborn child. One of his\nbarons took the bet. And so, the lumberman’s son was brought to the\npalace.”\n“Were you that boy?” Dalinar asked.\n“No,” Wit said. “But I was young then, frightfully so. I’d somehow\nfound a weapon destined to kill a god, and was carrying it un-wittingly.”\nOddly, as they entered the main thoroughfare toward the lifts, nobody\nmade way for Dalinar. “What did you do to me?” he asked as they walked\n—Wit strolling, Dalinar marching.\n“Just a little Lightweaving,” Wit said. “We don’t have time for you to be\nmobbed. Besides, Dalinar, I want you to enjoy it.”\n“The story?”\n“No, this,” Wit whispered, his hands out toward the people they passed.\nThis. Dalinar let the silence linger as they continued, and … he noticed a\nConnection to the people. They’d followed him through rain and ruin to\nmake a new home at the tops of these unnamed mountains.\nAs he walked, at first each step felt as if he were marching to the\ngallows. His last confrontation, the conflict that would save or destroy him.\nThen … he started sensing their souls. The woman who carried a basket of\nclothing, the potter with his bucket of clay.

The child and the guard, both\nrunning, both shouting, dreams spinning in their minds. Even the\nStormfather, still there in the back of his head.\nSo many of them. So many stories. Dalinar thought he felt it, the same\nthing that Tanavast mentioned: the cords that bound all of humankind into\none family.\nToday, he was their dream. He was their champion.\n“What happened?” Dalinar asked. “To the lumberman’s son?”\n“He failed,” Wit said softly. “I wasn’t able to stop him from doing so,\nand it haunts me to this day.”\nNoura, in her colorful and patterned vizier’s robes, immediately stepped up\nto confront Adolin.\n“Save the city?” she demanded. “You will not pull the emperor into\nsome suicide mission! He needs to retreat and be safe, to inspire the people\nto fight for their freedom.”\n“It’s not a suicide mission,” Adolin said. “You yourself told me that the\nperson who controls the throne controls the empire. If we can obtain it\nbefore the deadline, and hold it until the moment arrives, the kingdom will\nbelong to Yanagawn.”\n“Because of a single precedential ruling,” Noura said.\n“The enemy is bound by laws like that,” Adolin said. “It can work. My\nfather’s confrontation with Odium is in …”\n“Just under two hours,” May said.\n“Around two hours,” Adolin said. “All we have to do is sneak into the\nthrone room!”\n“People will be rushing out of the city,” Kushkam said, standing. That\ngash across his nose and cheeks was really something—like he’d taken an\naxe straight to the face. “The enemy will likely just be letting refugees leave\n—fewer people to feed and watch as they secure the city.”\n“The Windrunners made it in here,” May said, pointing. “That’s proof\nthat the city isn’t locked down. I think he’s right!”\n“People are fleeing the city,” Drehy said. “The enemy is busy setting up\nbarracks, supply depots, checkpoints.”\n“Common methods of securing a city,” Colot said, with a grunt. “There\nwill be chaos for a little longer, and the checkpoints won’t all be up yet. We\ncould probably make it most of the way to the palace by acting like scared\ncitizens.”\n“Where,” Kushkam said, “His Imperial Excellency implies he can get us\nin quietly.”\n“I can!” Yanagawn said. “I was in the planning meetings with my uncle.\nI know all the options to sneak in.” Hope rose in Yanagawn’s voice, a single\ngloryspren appearing above him.\nThat spark of light inside Adolin found purchase, and started to build\ninto a flame. He’d been broken down entirely … and it felt like a fresh start.\nSometimes, Maya said, you don’t need a Radiant or a Shardbearer. A\nperson’s life isn’t meaningless because they can’t hit the hardest anymore,\nAdolin. At some point, you’re going to realize why you’re really here.\nThank you, he thought. For believing in me."

For believing in me.\nIt’s kind of our job, she replied, and took a breath. Warning. My plan to\nhelp you probably won’t matter anymore … I was counting on there being\nan army with you. You might not need me.\nI’ll always need a good friend, Adolin thought. A person’s life isn’t\nmeaningless because you—\nShove it, she said, though he felt amusement from her.\n“We can do this,” Yanagawn continued. “We bring a small force, sneak\nin, and—”\n“Maybe they can try,” Noura said, gesturing to Adolin. “But not you.”\n“I must lead them, Noura,” Yanagawn said.\n“Just tell them how to get in. Stay here, safe.”\nYanagawn drew himself up. Met her eyes. And spoke with a voice that\nseemed not wholly his own. “I am emperor. I will lead them.”\nThey locked gazes. Then Noura started crying. Not because she’d lost\nthe argument, Adolin realized, but because she was afraid. “I don’t want\nyou to get hurt,” she whispered. “I don’t want to lose you. Please.”\nStorms … that wasn’t the face of a bureaucrat trying to enforce rules. It\nwas the face of a mother speaking to a son. They might not be related by\nblood, but suddenly her resistance to Adolin’s efforts took on a new light.\n“After all we’ve done to you,” she said, grasping Yanagawn’s hands,\n“after all we’ve asked of you, Yanagawn, I don’t want to see you get killed.\nWe elevated you out of shame, and you proved better than any of us. Please.\nI want you to be safe.”\n“I …” He took a deep breath. “I can’t be safe. Not if my people need\nsomething more.” He looked to Adolin. “You’re with me?”\n“To the end, Your Majesty,” Adolin said.\n“Then gather and prepare my forces, please.”\n“We’ll accept anyone,” Adolin said, turning to the room, “who can stand\nand walk.”\nNearby, a small figure scrambled up from among the scribes. The\nspindly Azish girl, Zabra, who he had sent to understudy with May.\n“Anyone?”\n“Remember how I told you,” Adolin said, “that if you did what I said,\nyou’d someday get your chance, Zabra?”\nShe nodded eagerly.\n“Well, I’m in no position to turn down anyone who can hold a blade.\nFind yourself one.” He scanned the room as a small band formed from\namong the survivors—including Kushkam, Sarqqin the blacksmith, Hmask,\nand Colot. Rahel the teenage Truthwatcher. A few other soldiers.\n“And what of them?” Gezamal said, nodding to the Windrunners. “They\nhave orders to bring you to safety.”\nAdolin glanced at Drehy and Skar, who seemed offended by the\nimplication. “Orders last until the situation changes,” Skar said. “Any good"

What do you need from us, Adolin? We’re in.”\nDrehy nodded in agreement.\nAdolin smiled, and did not look at Gezamal, who might take that as\ngloating. “Thank you, my friends. How many Heavenly Ones did you see\nout there?”\n“A good thirty, I’m afraid,” Drehy said.\n“Only a handful of other Fused though,” Notum added, standing on\nMay’s shoulder, small sized, “from what I saw.”\n“We’ll never succeed if too many Fused come for us,” Adolin said. “But\nif Drehy and Skar can lead those Heavenly Ones away …”\n“We can do that,” Skar said. “We’ve had practice. We should be able to\nimply a whole force of Windrunners is coming—which will mobilize the\nenemy Fused, send them into offensive patterns. We should be able to keep\nthem all out of your way for a few hours.”\nYanagawn began taking off his robes. He dumped the whole mess onto\nthe floor, leaving him in an undershift.\n“What are you doing, Majesty?” Noura asked.\n“Those robes will draw attention,” he said, suddenly seeming just an\nordinary youth. “My people don’t need an emperor right now, Noura. They\nneed a thief.”\nI record here the notes of the song. The Wind knows it very well. I\ncannot hear her voice, but sometimes I hear the flute.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 117\nSzeth hummed softly to himself as he drove the wagon in the morning light.\nHe realized, idly, it was the song that Kaladin had been playing. Nin-son-\nGod had fallen quiet, and Szeth wondered if he’d dozed off—but that\ncouldn’t be possible given how much the wagon bumped.\n“Aboshi,” he said to Nin, “it would really help if you could tell me why\nIshar came up with this plan. What did he think it might accomplish?”\n“Agreed,” Kaladin said, watching the road ahead of them. “I’m ready for\nsome answers.”\n“It started,” Nin whispered after a short time, “when Ishar told me that\nhe foresaw pain in the future. Taln had already lasted longer than any of us\nbelieved he could. Thousands of years.”\n“Thousands of years?” Kaladin said. “Wait, none of you died during that\ntime?”\n“We are more resilient than mortals,” Nin said. “You noticed, surely.”\n“Yeah, I suppose I did,” Kaladin admitted.\n“Unfortunately,” Nin said, “several among us were growing … weaker.\nAccessing our natures, our blessings, was harder and harder. Kalak, Chana,\nVedel … Ishar worried that one of the weaker ones would die by some\naccident or incident. Worse, Ishar walked the Spiritual Realm, and foresaw\nfuture threats. He needed time, he said, to prepare for them. So he sent me\nto stop the Return. We … we decided that the rise of any other Radiant\norders would prompt the enemy to come. Only … only it didn’t.

I killed so\nmany … with no cause …”\nHe fell silent again, and Szeth waited, content to let him speak at his own\nspeed. Kaladin did the same. Syl, however, showed no such patience.\n“And?” she asked from where she knelt on the bench. “So? How does\nthis relate to Shinovar?”\n“My job was to stall,” Nin said, sounding dazed. “Ishar, in the meantime,\nsearched for solutions. Ways to bolster our strength for future fights. He\nstepped into the Well of Control and took upon himself some of Odium’s\npower, then began working on new kinds of soldiers. But he was on a cliff\nedge too. And his eventual solutions were …”\n“Were what?” Syl asked, turning around to look back at him.\n“Spren,” Nin said, “made physical so they could fight. Immortal, in\npossession of Surges, as is the natural state of many of your kind. I … It\nsounds outlandish to me now that I consider. But he also created something\nterrible …”\n“Human Fused,” Szeth guessed. “Like my father and my sister. You\nmade their souls able to be recalled to new bodies, so they can be reborn\neach time they are killed. That’s why I could slay these on my pilgrimage,\nand you don’t mind.”\n“Yes,” Nin said. “We did it to each Honorbearer, save one. Sivi rejected\nhim.”\n“Has he made any others?” Syl asked.\n“Just the Honorbearers so far. He was planning to make an army. It is far\neasier a process than new Heralds, who have other abilities. Is it … a good\nidea?”\n“That depends,” Kaladin said. “What is the cost?”\n“It … seemed small to me … once,” Nin said softly.\nThey reached a fork in the road, and Szeth took the path eastward,\nfarther into the hills. This was a borderland between Shinovar and Iri, the\nair bearing a highland chill, the ground containing more stone than soil.\n“A new body,” Nin said. “They need a new body each time. We do not.\nOur substance is rebuilt from the essence of Honor when we return. Ishar\nwas not able to access that power, so each rebirth of the Honorbearers\nrequires a body.”\n“Very like the Fused,” Kaladin said.\n“Yes, though humans do not rebuild themselves in storms,” Nin said, his\nvoice growing even softer. “I hear his process takes a few days, and is far\nmore painful.” Nin fell silent. Only the sounds of the wagon disturbed the\nhighlands. Creaking wheels. Jostling wood. Snorting horses.\n“So,” Kaladin said, “the cost is not worth paying.”\n“What if it protects us though?” Szeth asked. “What if it gives us\nwarriors who can fight the Fused?”\n“We can already fight the Fused,” Kaladin said. “We’ve done it time and\nagain in the past.”\n“This Return is worse though,” Nin whispered. “With the Everstorm, the\nFused cannot be locked away.

Perhaps these human\nFused …”\n“Sometimes,” Szeth agreed, “a price must be paid for survival.”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “Szeth. What you did destroyed you. Was that worth\nthe cost?”\n“I do not think so now,” Szeth said. “But what if someone has to make\nthe difficult choices, and do terrible things, so that others may have peace?”\n“What peace?” Kaladin demanded, waving his hands. “You think people\ncan live in peace, knowing what it cost? Look, I don’t have all the answers.\nI’ve told you that. But this isn’t a question of a few people needing to make\na terrible choice. That’s a lie—everyone, everywhere, faces these kinds of\ndecisions. That’s life. What kind of world would it be if every time such a\ndecision came up, we forced ourselves to sacrifice? Not giving up our lives\nor time, but our integrity, our happiness, our very identities?”\n“Misery,” Nin whispered. “It would be a world of misery and darkness.”\n“And what if by giving up our edge, we lose?” Szeth asked.\n“Then we lose, Szeth,” Kaladin said. “Maybe we even die. But in doing\nso, we retain ourselves—because I tell you, there are worse fates.”\n“Yes,” Nin said. “Yes. He is right. The Wind is right. The music … is\nright …”\n“Can you tell me about the Skybreaker dissenters?” Szeth asked. “That\nyou mentioned?”\n“Occasionally,” Nin said, “a group of them refuses my leadership. Billid\nclaimed … to have found old Skybreaker oaths. I thought it ridiculous at the\ntime …”\nNin refused further prompts, so Szeth let the conversation lapse, thinking\nabout his upcoming decision. Because it was important that he make\ndecisions. Even if he was persuaded by one side to choose as he did, he\nneeded to decide.\nKaladin is right, he concluded. And Ishar must be stopped.\nSzeth was the last bearer of Truth in Shinovar. He was the final\nHonorbearer. He needed to find a way to stop what had happened here. For\nhis family, for his people, and most importantly—this time—for himself.\n“The lumberman’s son failed,” Wit continued softly. “He did not prove that\na child born to working parents could grow up to be as learned as a king.”\n“Then why are you telling me this?” Dalinar asked, frowning as they\nwalked through Urithiru.\n“Because the way he failed is relevant,” Wit said. “You see, they set up\nterms for this contest. At the end of eight years of lessons—trained\nalongside the baron’s son and other nobility—the lumberman’s son would\nbe tested. Three tests, of which he needed to win at least one.\n“First was the test of the sword. Could he compete with the others in\nmartial prowess, using the weapons of the upper class? Second was the test\nof history. Could he recite the lineages of kings, the storied and notable\nevents of their kingdom, the important provinces and their exports?”"

Could he recite the lineages of kings, the storied and notable\nevents of their kingdom, the important provinces and their exports?”\n“Those seem reasonable,” Dalinar said. “But there’s a flaw in such a test.\nEven if all people are equal in general, not all individuals are equal in\ncapacity. One experiment with one boy can’t prove anything.”\n“And so, you’re smarter than they were,” Wit said. “Good. I worry about\nyou sometimes, Dalinar.”\n“Worry? Why?”\n“Everyone says you’re dense,” he explained. “I fear you will believe\nthem.”\n“Everyone?”\n“Mostly me,” Wit admitted.\nStrangely, Dalinar started to feel more confident as he walked toward\nwhat would certainly be the most important event in his life. “Is that why\nthe lumberman’s son lost?” he asked as they reached the atrium. “Because\nthey all ignored the reason for the contest? To prove that the lower class\ndeserved better lives?”\n“Would they deserve worse lives,” Wit said softly, “if they couldn’t win\nin a swordfight, memorize history, or complete the third task?”\n“No,” Dalinar realized. “And so …”\n“The entire contest was a sham,” Wit said. “There was no need for it.\nAnd really, there was no way to fail it.”\n“But you said he did.”\n“Yes,” Wit said. “Jerick was remarkable in that regard. You see, the king\nrealized what you did: that this test relied too much on random chance, even\nif the child had been chosen deliberately for his acumen by a scholar sent to\nteach in his little lumbering village.\n“Regardless, the king was wise, and set the odds in his favor. I said,\nvictory in any one of the three categories would have let the youth win. And\nwhile you’re right, and the entire contest was a sham, it felt important to\nthem. Perhaps under other circumstances it would have taught them\nsomething.”\nThey reached a lift, and Wit—unwilling to wait in line—dismissed\nDalinar’s Lightweaving. They commandeered the next one, and were soon\nsoaring up the atrium wall. The contest would take place on the roof.\n“What was the third of the three tests?” Dalinar said.\n“Poetry,” Wit said. “To win the test, he had to compose a piece of unique\npoetry.”\nDalinar blinked in surprise.\n“Don’t look at me like that,” Wit said. “Familiarity with words is\nconsidered important to many noble courts.”\n“Even for men?”\n“Remarkably, it’s usually the men. I’ve known many a king who insisted\nthat words with any substance were too difficult for women.”\n“The cosmere is a strange place, isn’t it?”\n“You have no idea.”\nDalinar leaned against the railing, watching the people in the atrium\nbelow. Feeling, despite the distance, his Connection to them. “Composing\nan original poem seems difficult.”\n“Impossible,” Wit said. “Originality is impossible.”\nDalinar frowned, glancing at Wit, who leaned on the railing beside him.\n“Trust me,” Wit said. “I’ve tried.

Everything has been done. Every story has been told.

Dalinar, I’m sorry for lying to\nyou, because I’ve played at words at your expense. Originality is impossible\nbut also unavoidable. Because not everything has been done before.” Wit\nglanced at him. “You haven’t existed before. None of us have.\n“That’s the sole originality we need. A story might have been told before,\nbut you haven’t told it. Every idea might have been thought, but each is new\nagain when you think them. And that lumberman’s son? He couldn’t fail.\nBecause I was to be the judge of his poem, and I deeply, sincerely believe\nthat every person is unique. The contest wasn’t about whether his poem was\ngood, merely if it was unique. He could have stood up, released an\nodoriferous belch, then sat down, and I’d have considered that acceptable.\nHe was destined to win.”\n“But he failed.”\n“He ran,” Wit whispered.\n“He … what?”\n“He ran away,” Wit said. “Off to war. He was cajoled into it, convinced\nto run. The lumberman’s son found the only way to lose an unlosable\ncontest. He didn’t show up.”\nHe ran …\n“Tanavast ran,” Dalinar said. “Instead of facing Odium—and I think it\nwould have destroyed the world if he’d chosen differently.”\n“A valid point.”\n“You wanted me to listen to this story. Why, Wit? I’m not going to run\nfrom this fight.”\nTheir lift thumped into place on the last level of the tower.\n“Journey before destination,” Wit said. “Your journey has led to this\ndestination. We’re here.” He turned and looked him in the eyes. “I can’t\nforesee what happens next.”\nDalinar frowned.\n“I think it’s because of Renarin,” Wit said, “and your link to him. Maybe\nit’s something else; regardless, I can’t see how this will go. I suspect Odium\ncan’t either. That frightens me because for the first time in all of this, I don’t\nknow the right story to tell.\n“But listen. The lumberman’s son? In running, he lost the contest—but it\ndidn’t matter. Because the next day, the barons launched a coup and\nexecuted the king.” Wit smiled grimly. “As I said, all governments are\ntechnically a form of republic.”\n“What became of the lumberman’s son in the end?”\n“He went to war. Fought, bled, learned, loved. He returned with\nvengeance one day and killed the barons. A remarkable tale, in fact.” Wit\nheld his eyes. “We never have all the answers, Dalinar.

It’s a\ndistraction. The contest of champions, the contract … all of it. The words,\nthe posturing. It’s pointless.”\n“Yes.”\n“But I am not pointless. My life. People’s lives.

That’s what\nNohadon meant in his book.”\n“I don’t know what comes next, Dalinar,” Wit said. “But I’m glad you\nare the one who will walk up to meet Odium. Because while you might not\nknow the secret to defeating him, you have learned something more\nimportant. We’re not sending a soldier up those steps. We’re sending a\nking.”\nThe doctor gingerly removed the hogshide cup from Adolin’s stump,\npulling free the peg’s support framework. Adolin clenched his teeth, and\ndidn’t make a sound at the pain, although painspren betrayed him. He\ndeliberately didn’t look at the mess of blood and broken blisters.\nThe doctor silently cleaned it off while Rahel gave Adolin a quick\nhealing, sending a chill through him. It seemed a waste of Stormlight—the\ndoctor himself had a wicked cut along one thigh. However, Adolin was part\nof the strike force, and needed to be able to walk.\nAs the others pulled on cloaks to obscure them, the doctor returned and\nrefit the cup and peg. “Brightlord,” he said, “that healing won’t do enough.\nProblem is, while your wound is healed as if you’d had it for months, you\ndon’t have the calluses to match. This will soon start hurting again, and\ncould be distracting.”\n“This is our last chance,” Adolin said. “I have to risk it. Honest truth is\n… most of me hurts, Jakkik. The leg is just one more thing.”\nThe man glanced at him, then sighed and took something from his\npocket. A white powder, which he mixed into a flask of alcohol. “I normally\nonly give this to the dying,” he said, “because it’s so addictive. Tincture of\nfiremoss.”\nHe handed the cup to Adolin. “This will mute the pain, maybe even put a\nbit of a spring in your step. Until you crash tonight, Brightlord. When you\ndo, it will be bad.”\n“After the deadline?” Adolin asked.\nThe surgeon nodded.\nAdolin downed the entire thing. A few minutes later, he stepped out into\nthe morning sun with eleven others, including Notum. Together they slipped\nthrough Azimir, picking their way toward the palace. His father would\nconfront the enemy in approximately an hour and a half, according to\nNoura’s clock.\nNoura came along, despite her objections.

They carried minimal arms; helms and shields would have been\ntoo obvious. He had his side sword, and that was it.\nAdolin’s group was the last of the three to leave, and they moved in a\nhuddle through the city. Azimir was a mess. Moaning people, a dozen\nvarieties of dismal spren. Harsh smoke from a fire that had been started in\nthe distance. People moving in scattered, terrified clusters, flowing toward\nthe city exits. Singers patrolling in blocks, heavily armed and hulking, each\nled by a glowing-eyed Regal.\nAdolin’s group rounded the broken dome, now like the husk of some\ndead greatshell, abandoned and hollow. Ahead, down a roadway, a cloaked\nfigure waved. The first group that had left the safehouse had gone that way,\nto find one of the rally points where human troops might be holed up. The\nsecond group was searching a different rally point. Those twenty were\nhoping to find some resistance and make a fuss to draw attention away from\nthe palace, however briefly.\nSneaking a full thirty people into the palace had seemed like too much\nfor Yanagawn anyway, so they settled on eleven, plus Notum. Storms.\nWould those singers notice that his group was going against the general\nflow of traffic? Adolin felt like a dent on an otherwise perfect suit of armor\nduring inspection, right on the breastplate, blatant and visible.\nHe pulled his blanket closer, then gritted his teeth and let it flop again, as\nthat would better obscure his sword. He also let Yanagawn lead the way,\nand was impressed by how unregal the youth looked, hunched over. Just an\nurchin in a cloak. The emperor’s former life was—\nA door burst open near Adolin and he flinched, hand going to his sword.\nA group of singers stomped out of the building, carrying piles of silks and\nhandfuls of glowing gemstones. One smashed a window, laughing, as they\nhurried on. They barely gave him a second glance, but storms …\n“So much for them not looting,” Colot said softly, pulling up beside\nAdolin as they continued on. “There’s far more happening here than I’ve\nheard of in other conquered cities.”\n“The severity of the general,” Adolin whispered, “influences the severity\nof the troops.”\nColot nodded. It wasn’t a direct correlation—disciplined generals\nsometimes had troops who got away from them. At the same time though,\nSadeas’s armies had always behaved differently from Dalinar’s. Even back\nin the old days.\nIn the signs they passed—broken windows, singer troops harassing\nrefugees, some civilian corpses—Adolin could read a lot about their leader.\nIf he’d needed further reason to condemn Abidi, he found it here.\nAs for his father …\nAdolin found himself at peace for the first time in what felt like forever.\nNo longer inspired, as he had been earlier, but also no longer angry.\nWhat changed? Maya asked."

        "text": "As for his father …\nAdolin found himself at peace for the first time in what felt like forever.\nNo longer inspired, as he had been earlier, but also no longer angry.\nWhat changed? Maya asked.\nI’ve decided to let him be a person, Adolin thought. I’m not sure I’ll ever\nfully forgive him for killing my mother, but I’m willing to love him anyway.\nMore importantly, he’d given up on the dream of his father as some\nperfect paragon. And if Adolin’s father didn’t have to be the greatest man\nalive, then Adolin Kholin didn’t have to try to match that kind of incredible\nreputation.\nStrange what a relief it was to finally acknowledge that.\nI don’t get it, Maya admitted.\nI don’t think I do either, entirely, Adolin said. Humans don’t make sense.\nSpren don’t either, she said. Trust me. We pretend otherwise, but we’re\nfully capable of being storming messes. By the way, I should be close\nenough now that you can summon me; we can trust these spren to make the\nrest of the way on their own.\nNot sure we need them now, he said.\nUnfortunately, that’s true, she thought. I feel … She took a deep breath. I\nfeel like a fool. I should have stayed and helped.\nI’d have fallen in the last fight anyway, Adolin thought. They’d have\ntaken your Blade and used it against us. So maybe it’s a blessing, what\nhappened.\nThey reached an intersection and Yanagawn had them pause. Adolin\nwaved for the others to huddle up with him, and told them not to act so\nmuch like soldiers—not to stand in a line, scanning the area with careful\neyes.\nI think, Adolin said to Maya, that I really felt, deep down, that I had to\nstep up and take my father’s place. I felt, for some reason, that since he had\nproven to be flawed, I had to take his place and be perfect instead. I’ve\nbeen running from that for a long time, because I knew I couldn’t be.\nShe sent him a grunt of appreciation, and a feeling—through their bond\n—that she understood how messed up that must have felt.\nYeah, he thought. My anger over my mother’s death wasn’t just … just\nabout what he did. It was like I was furious at him for toppling my perfect\nimpression of him. Like, he was supposed to be better than that.\nHe should have been, Maya said. But nobody ever really is.\nNobody, Adolin thought. Especially not me.\nThey started across the road in small groups, reaching the wall around\nthe palace complex. Adolin waited until the last group had crossed, ready to\nscuttle forward himself. Right before he did, though, a group of singers\ncame stomping along the road.\nHe and Zabra, who were the last to go, huddled against the wall of the\nbuilding. This group of singers wasn’t looting, and they prowled with a\nmore deliberate, martial step. Though Adolin wished they would just move\non, one stopped at the corner, glancing at him.\nAdolin’s blood froze, sweat prickling his brow. A warm wind blew in,\nrippling the blanket, pushing it back, exposing his peg leg. The singer"

The singer\nglanced at that, then at Zabra, an obvious child. The singer immediately\nrelaxed and continued on, leaving Adolin’s heart to slowly recover as he\nmade a fist, having nearly summoned Maya.\nThey waited a minute or two, then hurried to join the others. As they did,\nhe found Notum with them, standing on Kushkam’s shoulder.\n“I’m sorry, Adolin,” the spren whispered. “I should have spotted that\npatrol. I was scouting around inside the complex.”\n“It’s fine,” Adolin said.\n“Last time,” Yanagawn said, looking at the wall into the palace complex,\n“my team climbed this wall to get in. This spot is hard to see from the\ninside, lacking major windows or guard posts. However, I think we should\ntake another route: the smuggler’s port.”\n“The what?” Noura asked.\n“Smuggler’s port,” Yanagawn said. “A hidden entrance to the palace\ncomplex you can bribe your way through.”\n“There’s no such thing,” Noura said.\n“Um … yes there is,” Yanagawn said. “Sorry. My uncle didn’t want to\nuse it, as he figured the soldiers who ran it wouldn’t respond well to thieves.\nThey only let people bribe their way in for small-scale crimes.”\n“And you think this is our best path?” Adolin asked him.\n“Yes,” Yanagawn said. “Climbing the wall was more difficult than we\nexpected—and I don’t fancy our chances of doing so unseen with this many\npatrols out here and Heavenly Ones in the air. I think I can get the port\nopen, even if no one is manning it.”\nAdolin glanced at Kushkam, then both of them nodded, and Adolin\ngestured for Yanagawn to lead the way. He did, May on his heels and\nNotum zipping ahead, invisible to all but them.\nYou were wrong earlier, Maya said.\nAbout what?\nAbout yourself. You said you especially didn’t live up to what people\nexpected. But you’re a storming good person, Adolin. Better than your\nfather.\nI think, today, he thought back, the important fact is that I don’t need to\nbe better than him. He can just be a person. And I … I can just be one too.\nFair enough, Maya said. Does this mean you’ll stop trying to do\neverything all by yourself?\nBy himself? You have us mixed up, he said. My father is the one who\ninsists on doing everything all alone, as if he’s the only one who matters.\nYeah? Maya said. When Kaladin needed help, you were there.\nSure, he’s my friend.\nWhen Shallan had secrets, you didn’t pry.\nJust trying to be a good husband, he said as they reached a section of the\nwall obscured by some planters and trees.\nThat’s always how you are, Maya said. I’ve been watching a long time\nnow, Adolin. Watching you give everyone whatever they need. What about\nwhat you need?\nHe fell quiet as Yanagawn knocked.\nMaybe I don’t need anything, he said."

He increasingly enjoyed seeing her\npersonality emerge.\nYanagawn began feeling around a hidden section of wall, behind vines\nthat quivered at his touch. “There’s a lever back here somewhere …” he\nexplained. But before Adolin could offer to help search, a slot in the wall\nopened.\n“Who are you?” a muffled voice hissed. “Never mind. It’s dangerous out\nthere. Hurry, get inside.”\nThen a section of the ground slid open, revealing a small tunnel leading\nunder the wall. A few small diamond chips, barely infused, revealed a\nconfused soldier’s face looking up from the pit.\nTogether, they piled in—forcing the soldier backward as he watched\nthem, waving away anxietyspren. There was space for them all down here,\nan entire hollowed-out room perhaps ten feet long and twenty wide. It was a\nlittle like the saferoom they’d been in before—with water traps along the\nwalls for drainage.\nOther refugees and injured people clogged the space as Adolin’s group\ncrowded in. There were only two other soldiers, and one was severely\nwounded, his back to the wall, halberd on the ground next to him. Blood\npooling at his side. Rahel gasped, and rushed to help him.\n“You look like important folk,” the guard said, eyeing Kushkam. “I think\nI’ve seen you before …”\nYanagawn held his hand up to forestall Kushkam’s comment, then\ndropped his cloak to reveal himself.\nThe guard looked him up and down. “And … you are?”\n“Oh, right,” Yanagawn said. “I’m without my regalia. I am Yanagawn,\nthe emperor.”\n“And I’m the storming king of …” the man began, then trailed off as\nNoura—wearing her thick, patterned vizier’s coat—dropped her cloak. The\nguard’s eyes bulged, then he glanced toward Rahel, who started glowing as\nshe healed the wounded soldier.\n“Excellency!” the guard said to Noura, then fell to his knees. “I didn’t\nrealize … I shouldn’t have spoken to …”\n“Ask him,” Yanagawn said, “how he ended up here.”\n“What is your situation here?” Noura asked, Adolin watching the\nexchange with amusement.\n“We fled here after the dome fell,” the guard said. “I kind of run the\nplace, you see, and we needed somewhere to … Storms! Is it really him? Is\nit …” He barely dared look at Yanagawn.\n“It is him,” Noura said, her voice displeased. “Majesty, why didn’t you\ntell me of this place?”\n“Because you’d have shut it down,” Yanagawn replied.\n“It should be shut down,” Noura said, staring with loathing at the two\nsoldiers. “They’re thieves.”"

He glanced at the two soldiers.\n“Today, we’re lucky they exist. This place serves a necessary function—\npeople are going to need to get in and out of the palace complex unknown\nby the officers. If it’s going to happen, well, wouldn’t you rather have loyal\nsoldiers be in charge of it?”\n“Loyal?” Noura said.\n“Loyal to the empire,” the wounded guard whispered, blinking awake,\nnodding in thanks to Rahel. She knelt back, and storms, Adolin could see\nhow exhausted she was. She barely had any Stormlight, and had stolen\nLight from the chips in the room to perform this minimal healing.\n“Always loyal,” the wounded man continued, chuckling, blood on his\nlips. “Doesn’t mean we can’t perform a few … extra services here and\nthere.”\n“All the thieves knew,” Yanagawn said, “that this lot wouldn’t take\nkindly to anyone sneaking in with too bad an intent.” He looked to the\nunwounded soldier. “You are chosen today, and may speak directly to me.\nWhat is your name?”\nThe man fell to his knees, bowing his head. “Jaskkeem.”\n“Jaskkeem,” Yanagawn said. “We’re going to take back the palace. Can\nyou get us across the grounds unseen?”\nThe man looked up, tears in his eyes. “Take back the palace?”\n“Yes,” Yanagawn said, confident. “We will save Azir if we can hold the\nthrone room. Can you lead us there?”\n“Absolutely, Majesty. There’s a tunnel here that leads right up next to the\nmain palace building!”\n“Then let us be quick,” Yanagawn said. “And may Yaezir guide us, for I\nfear we have less than an hour to accomplish our design.”\nCuriously, the closest I came to the Knight of Wind and the Knight\nof Truth during their quest happened during the last hours before\nStormfall. When they visited my parents’ house, while I was\nasleep, and purchased their wagon.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 27\nI think Ishar took the power … maybe three hundred years ago?” Nale said\nfrom where he lay in the wagon bed. “Four?

To our\nshame.”\nKaladin found himself strangely calm as he sat in the front seat between\nSzeth and Syl. Time was running out, but he was willing to take this next\npart slowly.

        "text": "This region seemed empty—though earlier in the night, before reaching\nNale’s cache, they’d swung past a larger city glowing bright in the distance.\nThe size had shocked Kaladin. He’d begun to think of this land as\npopulated solely by homesteads and farming towns.\nHe’d immediately felt foolish. Visiting Hearthstone and the region\nnearby, one would have assumed Alethkar had no grand cities. Shinovar’s\nmonasteries were deliberately placed in less populated regions—so while he\nhadn’t seen much urban development here, it obviously existed. There was\neven an Oathgate here somewhere.\n“He Connected himself to this land,” Nale continued. “I don’t know the\nprocess—I don’t understand a fraction of the things Ishar can do with his\npowers. Seven millennia later, I still couldn’t tell you why Ashyn burns.\nHowever, it was after he took the power … and became the spren of this\nland … that he started seeing himself as the Almighty. Oh, it had always\nbeen there, this sense of grandeur. He is not a humble man, our Ishar. But he\nnever thought he was God. Not until … he kind of became one …”\nKaladin glanced at Syl, who uncharacteristically hadn’t gone soaring\nupon the winds. Instead she remained human size, occasionally resting her\nhead on his shoulder, though she didn’t get physically tired. She’d look to\nthe skies, where—now that it was light—only a faint shimmering in the air\nindicated that spren were migrating this way in Shadesmar, Kaladin’s armor\nspren flying around up there with them.\n“Does any of this make sense to you?” Kaladin asked softly.\n“Honor died,” she said. “Leaving this land without a god. It’s reasonable\nsomeone would try to fill that void. Ishar’s attempt seems … less than\nstellar.”\n“If we kill him, Nin,” Szeth said, “can we actually end his touch on the\nland and free my people?”\n“I don’t entirely know,” Nale said. “Our immortality is related to our\nstatus as Heralds, but was conferred separately. We can still be reborn. I\nthink that to save this land, you must do more than defeat Ishar. You must\ndo for him what you did for me … but it will be harder.”\nSzeth looked to Kaladin.\n“There might be a way,” Kaladin said, leaning forward in his seat.\n“Dalinar says that a spoken oath might restore Ishar, at least briefly.”\n“When a Radiant says the Words,” Syl agreed, “they don’t just Connect\nto their spren in the Cognitive Realm, they Connect to the Spiritual Realm.\nIt’s a mini perpendicularity each time. A confluence of power and Intent,\nand an alignment of self.”\n“How close are you?” Szeth said, still regarding Kaladin.\n“I have barely let myself think about the final Words,” Kaladin admitted.\n“The last set nearly broke me.”\n“Then it will have to be me,” Szeth said, “but there is a difficulty here.\nFor Skybreakers, I must complete my quest in order to say the Fourth\nIdeal.”\n“Yes,” Nale said. “The Fourth Ideal—the quest. The Fifth to become the\nlaw. I have said those words already. I cannot be the one.”"

        "text": "Ideal.”\n“Yes,” Nale said. “The Fourth Ideal—the quest. The Fifth to become the\nlaw. I have said those words already. I cannot be the one.”\n“So you have to finish your quest,” Kaladin said to Szeth.\n“But defeating Ishar is what finishes my quest,” Szeth said. “We cannot\nrestore him to sanity without the burst of power I might release at the\nWords, but I cannot say the Words unless he is already defeated.”\nDamnation. Kaladin chewed on that, seeking another way. Could he …\ncould he talk to Ishar, and help him as he’d helped Szeth?\nSyl nodded toward Nale. You helped him, her voice whispered in his\nmind.\nThe Wind helped him, Kaladin sent back through the bond.\nYou and the Wind together.\nKaladin frowned at the idea. “What is the Wind, Syl? I feel that I’m\nmissing something here.”\n“She’s part of something very ancient,” Syl said, looking back at the sky.\n“I’m an honorspren, and was created by him—or the remnant of him that is\nthe Stormfather. Yet this isn’t a world of just Honor.” Her expression\nbecame distant, searching. “There’s more. Before Honor, Cultivation, and\nOdium arrived … Roshar was here. If a God still lives, I find him in the\nquiet breeze that dances with all things.”\nThat … didn’t help terribly. But he couldn’t keep from thinking of times\neven in his youth when the wind had been there, and how eventually it had\nbrought Syl to him.\nThe time approaches, the Wind whispered to him. The hour when spren\nmay need a champion. I wish that it were not so.\n“And what does it mean?” Kaladin whispered. “What will be required of\nme?”\nEverything. I’m sorry …\nSzeth soon slowed the wagon. “We’re close. I’ve only been here once\nthough.”\n“It’s over to your left,” Nale whispered, sitting up. “Along that ridge\nthere, beside the mound that was once a thunderclast corpse. Twist around\nto those rocks, where stones rise like a cathedral. That’s where you’ll find\nhim.”\nSzeth started them rolling that way, across stone and occasional patches\nof soil. In fact, Kaladin was shocked to see that some of the stone bore grass\nthat peeked from holes. Real grass. After only nine days, he found it odd\nhow surprising its movement was.\nA place where two grasses met. They drove up a shallow stone incline,\nonto a small ridge.\n“I remember,” Nale said, his voice haunted, “when this entire region was\nfilled with corpses. When it burned, and even mountains had been slain. I\nremember … a final battle …”\n“Aharietiam,” Syl said. “It was here?”\n“Yes,” Nale said. “This is where Honor abandoned his Heralds. This is\nwhere we walked away, leaving our Blades and our … self-worth. I don’t\nknow that I can ever have mine back …”\n“Nonsense,” Kaladin said. He turned, twisting to look at Nale. “Don’t\ntalk like that.”\n“I left him,” Nale whispered. “I left Taln. I thought he’d break soon. He\nshould have broken soon. But he lasted over four thousand years.”"

But he lasted over four thousand years.”\n“And how long had you suffered?” Kaladin asked.\nNale looked away.\n“The burden you ten carried,” Kaladin said, “is unfair. And while trauma\ndoesn’t excuse what you did, it does explain it. We can’t let you, or Ishar,\nhurt others—but that doesn’t mean you weren’t hurt yourselves. You have a\nright to receive help.”\nNale continued to look away, but he gave a shallow nod. “There was no\ngrass long ago. It can grow here now. Remarkable.”\nSoon they reached the rock formation, which rose high like the walls of\nan ornate monastery. And standing in its shadow was a figure with an\nHonorblade. With white hair and beard, Shin by the look of his features,\nwearing blue robes.\nSzeth stopped the wagon. “Nin,” he said. “Nightblood. Please guard the\nHonorblades.”\nSzeth? Nightblood asked. You’re going to fight without me?\n“I don’t know if I’m going to fight at all,” he replied. “But if I do, I will\nuse my Shardblade.”\nBut … I’m a great sword, aren’t I?\n“You are a great sword,” Szeth said, climbing from the wagon. “But you\nare also too dangerous. I’m sorry, sword-nimi. I do not want to kill today.”\nBut … but evil …\n“I see no evil,” Szeth replied. “Merely confusion.”\nHe glanced at Kaladin, who climbed down as well. Together they walked\nto the edge of the clearing, looking toward Ishar. Syl landed beside Kaladin,\nand a moment later—perhaps spurred on by her—12124 appeared beside\nSzeth. In a human shape and size.\nThe Wind joined them a moment later. A soft, encouraging breeze.\nKaladin looked to Szeth. “Ready?”\nSzeth considered. Kaladin gave him time. Then finally, Szeth started\ntoward Ishi’Elin, Herald of Oaths. The rest of them followed.\nAdolin and his team emerged from the tunnel into the famous grounds of\nthe Bronze Palace.\nThe sight was stunning. Even the stone had been Soulcast into bronze—\nwith little bits of quartz in it, to make it sparkle and shine like a sky full of\nstars. As they climbed out of the hidden tunnel exit, he saw figures\nswooping past high in the sky: a formation of Heavenly Ones moving away\nfrom the city center. Drehy and Skar had done their job well, it seemed.\nThe grounds were silent, particularly compared to the chaos and looting\nin the streets outside. Jaskkeem—the soldier who ran the smuggler’s port—\nled them across one last stretch of bronze ground up to the palace itself, an\nornate building with smooth metal walls. The tip of Adolin’s peg leg\nthumped with each step, rubber on bronze. It didn’t hurt, as the doctor’s\ntincture was working—and Adolin felt a zip of alertness and energy.

It was gaudy, yes, but also\nundeniably gorgeous.\nYanagawn led them to one of the large building’s back doors—and\nNoura had a key. They were inside a second later, and the emperor shared a\ngrin with Adolin.\n“I feel like I’m actually doing something,” the younger man whispered.\n“For the first time since taking this throne, I’m helping rather than merely\nsitting and being seen.”\n“How long until my father’s confrontation?” Adolin asked Noura.\n“Just over half an hour,” she whispered.\n“We have to slip into the throne room unseen,” Yanagawn said. “We hold\nthe room quietly, without anyone the wiser, until the deadline. We won’t\neven have to raise a sword.”\n“That would be storming beautiful,” Adolin said.\nThey continued on, Kushkam, Sarqqin, and Gezamal forming the\nrearguard, May and Yanagawn going first, taking Jaskkeem with them.\nNotum scouted ahead, as before. That left Noura, Adolin, Colot, Rahel,\nHmask, and Zabra at the center of their line. Adolin threw off the blanket\nnow that they were inside—as the group would be suspicious here no\nmatter what. He hoped they simply wouldn’t encounter anyone.\nThe place was dead. Staff had been evacuated, and all the guards had\nbeen recruited into the war effort. They did find places where the doors had\nbeen broken open, so the enemy had been here, but perhaps they’d secured\nthe palace complex and moved on. Could Adolin be that lucky?\nNo, he thought. This seems deliberate.\n“Wait a moment,” he said to the others, causing them to bunch up around\nhim. “This feels too quiet. What are we walking into, Yanagawn? What is\nthe layout of the hallways ahead of us?”\nNoura pointed, used to answering questions directed toward the emperor.\n“See that hallway at the end of this one? We take a left there, then another\nimmediate left into the throne room.”\nHe looked ahead, down a grand hallway with chandeliers and art on\nevery storming free space of wall. It ended at a T intersection. Left to the\nthrone room.\n“What do you mean by too quiet, Adolin?” Yanagawn asked.\n“There should be looting here,” he said. “Or at least guards stationed to\nwatch to be sure it doesn’t happen. Notum. Check our rear.”\nThe spren saluted and became a ribbon of light, then zipped back the\nway they’d come in.\nBe ready, Adolin thought to Maya.\nGot it, she replied.\n“I think this is a trap,” Adolin said. “Three ways out—back the way we\ncame, forward and to the left, forward and to the right. I’m betting there are\ntroops at each position.” He looked to Kushkam, then May. Both nodded,\nagreeing with his assessment.\n“We knew this probably wouldn’t be easy,” May said. “We’ll have to\nsend someone in to hold the throne, then fight to hold the room.”\n“We can bolt the doors in seven places,” Yanagawn said, “with the flick"

If this is a trap, the room will be locked tight.”\n“Can we cut our way in?” Sarqqin asked. “Brightlord Adolin, is your\nShardblade available yet?”\n“It is,” Adolin said. “That spot up to our left? That’s the wall into the\nthrone room. I could slice us a hole there maybe, and we’d at least have a\nway out.”\nNoura winced.\n“The entire chamber is lined in aluminum,” Yanagawn said.\n“Remember? I told you we lined it after learning about Deepest Ones. But\nthere is a hidden door.”\nHe led them to a spot between two ornate urns on pedestals. Here, Noura\nflipped a hidden switch, but nothing happened.\n“Jammed shut,” Colot guessed. “That proves it. They’re ready for us.”\nYanagawn looked to Adolin with panic in his eyes. “Do we run?”\n“Where?” Adolin said. “Yanagawn, it would have been nice if we could\nsneak, but life is rarely that easy.”\nNotum came zipping back a second later. “You’re right, Adolin,” he said.\n“A good fifty troops, with some Fused, are coming up behind us.”\nKushkam pointed the way forward. They continued along the hallway,\nreaching the T intersection. To both their left and their right—perhaps fifty\nfeet down each corridor—waited another force. Hundreds of them.\nSounds announced the troops coming up behind. Kushkam gave him a\ngrim look, sword out. They were well and truly surrounded.\n“We’re doomed,” the emperor whispered.\n“Perhaps,” Adolin said. “But do you remember that there was one last\nway a smaller force can defeat a greater one?”\n“Yes,” Yanagawn said. “You promised to tell me what it was.”\nKushkam grunted. He was forced to hold his sword in his off hand\nbecause of his lost fingers. “You taught him those, did you?”\n“What is it?” the emperor asked, gripping his sword in nervous fingers.\n“The fourth way.”\n“The game can never fully account for the human spirit, Yanagawn,”\nAdolin said. “Numbers, advantages, disadvantages, statistics … sometimes\nthey lie. Because sometimes the smaller force fights in a way that no pieces\non a board can ever replicate. Sometimes in real life, when the odds of\nwinning are miniscule—and any smart general would have surrendered—a\nforce keeps fighting. And wins.”\nYanagawn trembled. “There are hundreds of them though …”\n“Why aren’t they attacking?” May asked, bow out and strung, her hand\nresting on the large dagger at her side.\nAdolin considered a moment, and realized he knew why. He walked a\nshort distance—just ten feet—to the left at the intersection, then pulled\nopen one of the doors to the throne room itself.\nIn the ornate, well-furnished room beyond, the lights were dim. Sitting\non the throne—illuminated from above—was a figure in glittering Plate, red\neyes shining through the slits on the front. Adolin’s Plate."

He stood and slid it from the wood, then raised it and pointed it at\nAdolin.\n“Wait out here,” Adolin said to the others.\n“But—” Colot began.\n“If those forces attack, hold this spot,” Adolin said. “Whatever else\nhappens, hold the room.”\nThen he stepped inside, hobbling on one foot and one peg, before closing\nthe door behind him. He got ready to call Maya.\nAbidi pulled a lever built into the shining bronze throne. The doors\nbehind Adolin clicked softly, the many bolts that Yanagawn had mentioned\nsliding into place.\n“They say,” Abidi growled, “you are this era’s greatest living\nswordsman.”\n“No,” Adolin said. “But I was trained by him.” He thrust his hand to the\nside to summon Maya.\nNothing happened.\nAbidi laughed, holding up his Blade. “Aluminum lines this room, little\nmortal. You should have summoned your Blade, then carried it into the\nroom. The Azish didn’t realize the death trap they were creating here. You\nhave to be very, very careful about how aluminum is applied—something\nthose of your time have yet to learn.”\nStorms. Storms.\nAdolin backed up, his heels touching the locked door.\n“You defeated me in front of all my soldiers,” Abidi said. “You cracked\nmy gemheart and stole my ability to fly, so I’ve had to crawl among the\nlowborn these ten days. It was either that or return and be reborn, losing my\nchance to win this land and rule, as is my right.”\nHe raised his Blade toward Adolin. “I stay sane by bathing in the blood\nof Radiants. Be honored. Today, I allow you that distinction instead.” The\nglow behind the helm seemed to intensify. “I’m going to enjoy this.”\nThen he rushed forward and attacked with a sweep of his Shardblade.\nWithin the Spiritual Realm, and beneath Formless’s eyeless gaze, Shallan\nwas subjected to death after death as the visions continued to try to destroy\nher.\nShe saw her mentors fall again and again.

They were\nsomething she used to cope. They helped and protected her. So, as the\nvisions continued, she rejected the lie that she would inevitably hurt people\nshe loved. She recognized it for what it was.\nBecause she, Shallan Davar, was an expert in lies.\nSoon the terrible visions began to fade, becoming just the ordinary\nSpiritual Realm again. It seemed that the shadow watching her had moved\nits attention elsewhere. She hadn’t stopped those terrible visions, but she\nhad weathered them, and that was a grand victory. Odium and Formless\nshould have picked something more novel, because she had spent the last\nseveral years practicing how to deal with this very flavor of pain.\nOnce the visions stopped coming so violently, a familiar sensation\nappeared in her mind. Pattern—then soon afterward, the shifting and\nflowing mists of the Spiritual Realm faded. She emerged into a black\nexpanse again, joined by her two spren, where Rlain and Renarin—real, as\nfar as she could tell—were waiting. They rushed to her.\n“Shallan?” Renarin said. “Are you well?”\n“Well enough,” she said. “Where are Glys and Tumi?”\n“Hiding inside us,” Rlain said. “With the gods moving about recently,\nthey are frightened.”\n“Shallan, I need to know what you saw,” Renarin said. “I think it might\nall be relevant, as I’m guessing the visions are embedded with clues from\nMishram.”\n“I agree,” Shallan said. “And I’ve been watching for clues too. We will\nfind her prison not in a place, but in a mindset. Her mindset. Which she’s\nbeen embedding into the visions we see.”\n“My friends,” Rlain said, “did not stand up for me. That’s what I saw.\nThen the day my people—the listeners—walked away. And … Mishram.\nShe was betrayed at the end by the other Unmade, who did not come to help\nher when she was captured. She was abandoned by friends and followers.”\n“Like me, she wanted to stand up for herself,” Renarin said. “Maybe\nthat’s why I saw what I did—a day when I was too weak and another had to\nprotect me. But then I grew, and became a man who could protect myself.\nAs she did, perhaps? When she decided to take up power and help the\nsingers?”\n“Instead of her father,” Shallan whispered. “She took the place of her\nfather. Mishram … did your father try to kill you? Is that the Connection\nyou’re trying to send? The message that will let us find you?”\nThe three of them stood together.\nIt wasn’t enough.\n“What now?” Rlain asked to Curiosity.\nShallan closed her eyes. “There’s more,” she whispered, thinking back to\nall she’d been experiencing. “Mishram is afraid that after so long, she’s\nbecome unpredictable—dangerous to those she loves. Even deeper, she’s\nafraid that she deserves this prison, because everyone betrayed her. Because\nshe’s been trapped with her own thoughts so long, they’ve betrayed her.\nThat’s what she’s feeling. That she deserves this suffering.”"

That she deserves this suffering.”\nShallan opened her eyes and stepped forward. A corridor appeared\nbefore her. It looked into a small stone room with soft glowing light.\nRenarin gasped. Rlain hummed.\nTogether they entered a small room lit by vibrant torches. A corpse lay in\nthe corner, old and desiccated, basically just bones. Holding … blocks? A\nchild’s blocks, and that side of the room was painted soft colors, like a\nnursery.\nThe corpse wore Melishi’s clothing. The ancient Bondsmith had died\nhere, alone, in the Spiritual Realm. After finding his childhood room, as\neach of them had.\nA brilliant glowing yellow heliodor lay in the center of the chamber,\nringed by candles that somehow still burned. It was cracked along one side,\ntiny wisps of smoke escaping to taint the Spiritual Realm, and eventually\nShallan’s drawings.\nMishram’s prison.\nShallan, Pattern thought to her. We are not alone.\nShe turned, and saw a shadow darkening the corridor behind them. It\nwas Mraize; she knew that posture. As he’d told her, their next encounter\nwould lead to the end.\n“I leave Mishram to you, gentlemen,” she said, walking out. “I need to\ndeal with a loose thread that has been left to dangle for far, far too long.”\nNavani’s breath caught as Dalinar stepped into her meeting room at the top\nof the tower.\nHe was back. He was alive.\nThe Sibling had warned her he was coming, so she’d waited to see if she\ncould tell from his eyes which Dalinar he was. The Bondsmith? The\nBlackthorn?\nNeither. He was neither.\nHe took her in his arms and kissed her. Those watching—guards, scribes,\nSebarial and Palona holding hands with a Herdazian wedding ribbon around\ntheir wrists—seemed to be made uncomfortable by his display of affection.\nNavani held the kiss, held him, held to that warmth. For it was nearly\ntime. Soon Dalinar would march up the steps to the roof, and the end would\ncome. Once the kiss broke, Navani hugged him, feeling the hard muscles.\nThe soft touch. “I’m sorry,” she whispered.\n“For what?” he asked.\n“For leaving you.”\n“Gemheart,” he replied, “you cannot leave me. I carry you inside. Gav?”\n“Safe,” she said. “Sleeping in the next room. He’s barely stirred since we\ngot out. Love, I thought we’d be able to help you from here. I was wrong.”\nHe squeezed her tighter. “You did the right thing, and you are wonderful\nin every way, Navani. I couldn’t have been saved. I didn’t want to be. There\nwere things I needed to see.”\nShe pulled back, but kept her arms around him, tipping her chin up and\nmeeting his eyes, so close to hers. “What?”\n“I always thought the burden of a king was the greatest a man could\nknow,” Dalinar said. “But I was a child, Navani, with a childish\nunderstanding.”"

Though over a week had passed, the hairs on his face told her how long\nhis body felt it had been gone. One day, maybe two. Remarkable.\n“Every moment we live changes us, Navani,” he said. “Living the\nmemories of gods has changed me above all. I saw his life, Navani.\nTanavast’s entire existence. It both haunts and inspires me.”\n“Storms,” she whispered.\n“Am I … still frightening to you, as you once said I was?”\n“No,” she said, searching his eyes. “Your fire is still there, Dalinar, but I\nknow it better now. It is not the fire of destruction, but the fire that spreads,\nshares its warmth. The fire that envelops my heart, but leaves me\nbreathless.”\nHe smiled. “I fear I will never live up to the things you say about me,\nlove. I am far too boring. Isn’t that what you once said? That older people\nshould be compelled to be boring?”\n“And yet,” she said, “I’m compelled to find you fascinating regardless.”\nThey shared a moment. The room around them—with ten pillars at the\nsides, one at the center, and the stairwell to the roof—remained quiet and\nstill, despite all the observers. Including Jasnah, who had kept to herself\nsince her return, feeling soundly her failure in Thaylen City.\nNo one dared clear their throats or remind them that the deadline was\nlooming. This was her time. Navani kissed him again, for ten burning\nheartbeats.\nWhen she pulled back, his eyes were sorrowful.\n“You don’t know how you’re going to beat him?” she guessed. “The trip\nthrough the Spiritual Realm … a waste?”\n“No,” he said. “Very much not a waste. It showed me how little I\nunderstand, which is a lesson I wish I could stop needing to be taught. I\ndon’t know what is to come. I don’t know if I’ll be able to counter it. But …\nI feel more confident than I did ten days ago.”\n“Do what is right in the moment,” she whispered.\nHe cocked his head.\n“I trust you, Dalinar. The man you’ve become, at last, is a man I trust\nfully.”\n“Even with the fire?”\n“Because of the fire,” she said. “There is no need to trust someone who\ncouldn’t hurt you, Dalinar. I trust you because you can hold that fire and not\nbe burned.”\nHe nodded. “I will do what is right.”\n“Discard all the rest. All the thoughts, philosophies, arguments, and even\nthe memories of gods. Do not do what they would have you do. Do what\nyou, Dalinar Kholin, would do.”\n“Thank you,” he said, then let go at last.

Your prayers. Your trust.” He nodded to Wit, who\nbowed his head in respect. Then, as he walked past Sebarial, Dalinar put a\nhand on the highprince’s shoulder.\nSebarial—remarkably teary-eyed—gripped Dalinar’s wrist in return.\n“Strange,” Sebarial said, “how we can accidentally become good men, eh,\nDalinar? A few choices here and there, and suddenly we’re respectable. The\nway your brother always said he wanted.”\n“My brother,” Dalinar said, “was a liar, Sebarial.”\nSebarial smiled, squeezing Dalinar’s arm. “So you finally know, do you?\nGavilar always talked about living the Codes, and here you’ve gone and\nbecome them. Go. Be a storming hero. Win our homeland back.”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “That’s what the path of gods has shown me,\nSebarial. I can’t just protect Alethkar; I have to find a way to defeat him\nfully.”\n“How will you storming do that?”\n“With oaths and light, Sebarial.” Navani had placed Dalinar’s copy of\nThe Way of Kings on a table. He smiled, slipped it off, and carried it in one\nhand as he strode up the stairs.\nI will leave one to ponder upon the incredible irony of the Herald\nof Bonds deciding he needed to teach Szeth, of all people, how to\nbe humble. As if years of slavery weren’t a capable instructor.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 83\nIshu-son-God took his hands off his Blade and clasped them behind\nhimself, leaving it stuck in the ground. A nonthreatening posture to greet\nthose who joined him in the shadow of the enormous rock formations.\nThose were tall, spindly, grasping toward the skies. Perhaps too fragile to\nhave existed in the East without toppling.\nSzeth stopped fifteen feet from Ishu. He glanced toward Kaladin, then\nSyl. “Either of you know what to do next?”\n“No idea,” Syl said.\n“Nale said he’d test you one final time,” Kaladin said. “To … teach you\nhumility.”\nSzeth took a deep breath, holding himself back from summoning his\nBlade. He was done with killing, unless he was given a very good reason.\nThat was his balance. No more fighting unless he decided the cost was\nworth it.\n“Ishu,” he called. “I’ve finished my pilgrimage.”\n“Indeed,” the man said, his voice loud, commanding. “You are worthy of\nmy presence, child. You may approach.”\nCautious, Szeth stepped closer, followed by Kaladin and Syl—and also\nby his own spren, who trailed along farther behind. Nin remained in the\nwagon.\n“Good, good,” Ishu said, smiling. He had a mid-length white beard,\ntrimmed straight across the bottom. He seemed more … human than Szeth\nhad expected.

I led you to become my warrior, Szeth, and sent you into the East to\nlearn how to fight like a demigod. To become my champion.\n“Now,” Ishu continued out loud, “you have returned to me. Refined, like\nthe clay pot having been fired in the kiln.”\n“Why?” Syl said. She pressed her hands together at her breast, obviously\nhorrified. “Why have you done this to Shinovar? Where are the spren?”\n“I prepare for the difficult times ahead,” Ishu said. “I have seen\ncataclysm, child. Roshar will need a God—a true God—to weather it.” He\nlooked up at the spren’s light, which spun around this place high in the sky\nlike a halo. “The spren rejected me, so I had to reject them.”\n“Is that why,” Szeth asked, his voice cold, “for centuries Shinovar has\nhad almost no spren? Why my people looked for them, worshipped them,\nand longed to listen to them … So that when a Voice came into their heads\n…”\n“It is time,” Ishu said, waving him forward. “You will be the first of my\nnew Heralds, and can train others to lead my Fused and spren armies.\nTogether we will make way for the end of the world, so that we may forge a\nnew one.”\n“Ishar.” It was Nin, stumbling forward, eventually reaching them and\naccepting Kaladin’s arm for support. “You’re wrong. We don’t see straight,\nany of us. Listen. Listen to the tones of Roshar, to the Wind. Listen to—”\n“You are weak, Nale,” Ishu said, glaring at him. “I will replace you next,\nonce Szeth has taken Jezrien’s spot. Come, Szeth, you are nearly ready.”\n“Nearly?” Szeth said, cold.\n“Szeth,” Kaladin said, nudging him and pointing backward. A group of\npeople had emerged from around the rock formations and were approaching\nthe wagon.\nSzeth recognized each of them. Moss. Pozen. Elid. The “dead”\nHonorbearers, turned into Fused by Ishu. There were six of them, and they\nhelped themselves to the Honorblades in the bed of the wagon.\nSzeth gritted his teeth and almost went to prevent the larceny, but Ishu\nspoke.\n“They do not steal what you have earned, Szeth-son-Shinovar,” the\nHerald said. “Be patient.”\nThe six filed forward, passing Kaladin and Szeth. Nin returned to the\nwagon, walking more steadily this time, and strode back with the rest of the\nswords, including Nightblood and Kaladin’s pack. He dropped those a short\ndistance away, then approached with two Blades.\n“Nale?” Kaladin asked."

The rock formations and ground here were\nlike ardents, with heads bowed in a ring, at worship—swords at the center.\nNin drove his Blade into position, then placed Sivi’s. Instead of\ncontinuing to sink all the way down to their hilts, the Blades remained\nwhere they were placed, half in, half out. As they’d proven while being\ncarried all this way, they knew how to modulate the sharpness of their\nedges.\n“Last time I was here,” Nin said, “there were nine.” He moved around\nthe circle, right hand hovering above the Blades. He stopped beside Taln’s,\nthe most simple, least ornate of those in the ring. “This one was missing\nthen.”\nIshu reached forward and put one hand on his own Blade. “And today,\nwe once more have nine. We are missing the Blade we sent with you,\nSzeth.”\n“It is lost,” Szeth said, feeling cold.\n“You will replace it with a new one,” Ishu explained. “It will form when\nyou join the Heralds.” He nodded to the Honorbearers, who stepped back.\nAnd Szeth realized something—he’d expected six figures. That was the\nright number. Szeth himself represented the Windrunners, and there was no\nsword for them. With Ishu, Nin, and Sivi—who had refused—that made\nten.\nExcept one of the figures was new. Instead of the female Edgedancer\nSzeth had faced in Shadesmar, there was a masculine figure in robes. The\nman looked up. Inside the hood, Szeth saw familiar features. Round,\nfriendly. Solid.\n“Father?” Szeth whispered.\n“It is well that you succeeded, Szeth,” Ishu said, drawing Szeth’s\nattention back to him. “And returned to your God.”\n“You are not a god, Ishar,” Kaladin said. “We’ve come to try to help you.\nBut we don’t want to fight; we just want to talk.”\nIshu sniffed in disdain. “As if you could fight me. But now there is no\ntime for talk. The final confrontation at Urithiru happens in mere moments,\nand Dalinar will fail. He is, and always has been, a fool and a pretender. He\nis to face Odium’s champion, yet he sends away his two finest soldiers?”\n“Perhaps he knows,” Szeth said, “that not every battle is also a fight.”\nIshu shook his head. “Once Dalinar is dead, we will need an army to\ndefeat both Odium and the greater storms coming.” He hesitated, then\nfocused on Szeth, as if momentarily surprised to see him there. “Right. I\nremember. You must be humbled. One last test, Szeth. My Honorbearers\nwill defeat you, together.”\n“Together?” Kaladin demanded. “He can’t fight all of them.”"

The red\nlightning seemed muted as it flashed from deep within the clouds, an erratic\nheartbeat. The lack of thunder following it was unnerving, but more so was\nthe figure made of dark mist coalescing on the rooftop.\nTaravangian. Standing tall, without the slight crook to his back he’d\nalways had when Dalinar had known him. He wore yellow robes, bordering\non gold, and a simple golden crown, his hands clasped behind him.\n“Dalinar,” he said, smiling in a way that Dalinar might once have seen as\nkindly. “Navani’s efforts to improve your punctuality have worked, my\nfriend.”\n“Do not name me friend.”\n“Should I lie?”\n“The friendship was the lie.”\n“I wish that were so.” His eyes appeared genuinely sorrowful. “That\nwould make what I’m forced to do to you oh so much easier.

Again he tried to summon his Blade, and again\nnothing. He couldn’t even sense Maya. What could he do?\nReach the throne, he thought, and trigger the unlocking mechanism?\nThen escape?\nAbidi crashed through furniture, tossing it aside as he gave chase. If\nAdolin couldn’t escape, then he had to succeed at a near-impossible task.\nOne only a single man in recent memory had ever accomplished: defeating\na Shardbearer in single combat when you were without.\nThe room had a set of unadorned bronze pillars running down either\nside, near the walls. Adolin hurdled a golden table, knocking over beautiful\ncandlesticks, then landed awkwardly on his peg. He tripped, caught himself\non a large stand with bowls on top, and made for one of the pillars to give\nhimself some better cover.\nAbidi kicked away the table behind him, then stumbled as he\noverextended.\nToo much force, Adolin thought as he reached the pillar and unsheathed\nhis side sword. He’s not used to the Plate. Adolin had seen similar stumbles\nfrom Yanagawn recently.\nAbidi wasn’t as awkward as the emperor had been. He stomped forward\nmore cautiously, faceplate glowing red. He was a trained soldier, with\nthousands of years of experience. But he couldn’t fly, so he had to rely on\nPlate he hadn’t had time to train in yet.\nThat was something at least.

Adolin rounded the pillar, putting it between himself and Abidi,\nwho had to stomp around it. Despite his swordsmanship, in that Plate he\nwasn’t as graceful with his footwork as he might otherwise have been.\nAdolin was able to keep ahead of his foe by weaving between the pillars,\nthen he limp-dashed to the far wall and the dais with the throne.\nHe searched, but he couldn’t find the mechanism to lock and unlock the\ndoor. He had no idea where the hidden exit was from this side, plus it had\nbeen jammed somehow. Escaping seemed unlikely.\nAbidi charged between the pillars, ignoring the low tables in the way—\ncrashing through them with a terrible racket, scattering fine silvery cups and\nplates to the ground.

He came in fast, but Adolin was able to leap to the side\n—and since Abidi had more momentum than he expected with the Plate, he\nstruck the throne, knocking it over.\nAdolin hit the carpet below the short dais and rolled, coming up on one\nfoot—the good one. Then he heaved himself up and dashed—as best he\ncould—toward the other set of pillars. He blessed the hours he’d spent\npracticing with the peg, since he could move somewhat quickly. At the\nsame time, he felt frustrated. Without this hindrance, he might have had a\nchance. Maybe he could have stood against a full Shardbearer who was new\nto his Plate.\nAs it was … Adolin did have some training in fighting a Shardbearer\nwithout Shards of his own. It was a little like training in how to land if\ntossed off a cliff. They all knew it meant basically nothing. He would die\nhere.\nNo. No more fatalistic thoughts. If he fell, Azir fell. He had to find a way\nto do the impossible. He had to stop this creature. Now.\nAdolin reached the first pillar, then turned as Abidi leaped off the throne\nand crashed down near him. He didn’t stumble this time. The Fused wasn’t\nsome bumbling fool—he was inexperienced with a new tool, but his posture\nwas excellent as he attacked again.\nAdolin attempted to find an opening to attack. Zahel had trained him to\nparry a Shardblade—it involved slapping the flat portion of the enemy’s\nweapon—but Adolin didn’t dare, because a single wrong move would be\ndeath. Instead he hopped back.\nHe tried as best he could, but Abidi had reach, strength, speed … and\nevery other advantage. He easily kept Adolin at bay, forcing him back\nbetween the pillars. At the final one, Adolin planned another strike—and his\ninstincts let him guess correctly the direction Abidi would come around the\npillar to attack. Abidi ducked around from the left, and Adolin performed an\nexpert lunge—but then the peg slipped. His sword clanged against the near-\nimpervious Shardplate, and Adolin fell, his bad leg going out from\nunderneath him.\nAbidi laughed. “It feels incredible to wear this Plate! To be invincible\nand watch you struggle, the rat that you are, with panic in your eyes. Why\nhave we never developed a version of this for ourselves?”\nAdolin rolled, knowing that the Blade would fall any moment. Puffing,\nincreasingly exhausted and aching—though in this room he drew no spren\nto betray his state—he crawled to his feet by using the rear wall to support\nhim. As soon as he did though, Abidi lunged and swung. Adolin threw\nhimself to the side, the only desperate move he could make in such a\nsituation, and managed to avoid the Blade. But he slipped and hit the\nground again, and was left with the haunting image of that sword passing\nless than an inch before his eyes.\nHe rolled over with a groan, propping himself up with his sword,\nsomewhat dazed as he found his feet.\n“They said you were good,” Abidi said, Blade pointed at Adolin. “Was I\nreally reawakened to fight one so pathetic?”"

If\nyou wanted a challenge, why didn’t you fight him?”\nThe glow of burning eyes through the faceplate increased, illuminating\nthe dimly lit room. That had struck a nerve.\n“You ran, didn’t you?” Adolin asked, backing away, sword out, hand\ncoated in sweat. “How regal of you.”\nThe Fused didn’t snarl or flinch at the barb, but he did kick an\noverturned table straight at Adolin. Adolin cursed, ducking, and got clipped\non the shoulder. Sharp pain rushed down his arm as he stumbled into one of\nthe pillars opposite the ones he’d been using. Perhaps taunting the\nimmortal, Surge-powered murderer in Shardplate wasn’t the best idea.\nAdolin committed himself to running and dodging, staying ahead—but\nonly because he could maneuver around the furniture and pillars. For one\nwho had just taunted his opponent for refusing a fight, Adolin was forced to\ndo the same. Even with that, he should have died.\nExcept it didn’t seem the Fused wanted to end this quickly. He stalked\nthrough the room, but didn’t give much chase. With a sinking feeling,\nAdolin realized that Abidi had no reason to be hasty. He held this throne\nroom—if the deadline arrived, Adolin had little doubt that by Azish law, the\nkingdom would go to Odium. Therefore, the Fused could bide his time,\ntoying with Adolin, enjoying his prey’s rising panic.\nAdolin had to win this fight quickly. Yet as he tried to set for Windstance,\nhis stupid foot—or not-foot—slipped again, and he was forced to brace his\nleft arm on a pillar to avoid tripping. In a duel, your footwork needed to be\nintricate. He expected to be able to spring off his toes. He needed heels to\nspin on. Needed the sides of his feet to stop himself.\nHe’d practiced walking and even half-running on this new foot, but he\nhadn’t practiced any footwork. There was no way he’d win against any\ncapable enemy, let alone one in Plate.\nAbidi cut off Adolin’s route to the other side of the room. “Do you miss\nthe energy and power of this Plate, little human? Do you feel small?”\n“I’ve felt small for years now,” Adolin whispered.\nBut as he said it, he found new perspective. He’d been complaining since\nthe fall of Kholinar—maybe longer—about how the world had changed,\noutgrown people like him. However, last night, he’d been a common\nspearman. Adolin realized right then that the world hadn’t changed that\nmuch. The darkeyes had always felt small in this world of Shardbearers.\nAdolin’s place had changed. He’d been complaining about suddenly\nbeing one of the small ones—a reality the vast majority of soldiers lived\nwith every day.\nKaladin survived this, he reminded himself again. Years ago, Kaladin\nhad killed a Shardbearer. It wasn’t impossible."

Years ago, Kaladin\nhad killed a Shardbearer. It wasn’t impossible.\nAbruptly, he was back at his training with Zahel.\nZahel had forced him to fight on a pile of shifting stones, because his\nfooting wouldn’t always be sure. He’d forced Adolin to fight in the rain, or\nwhen standing on a narrow beam. Adolin had grumbled at each session,\nclaiming he’d never need this kind of training in a practical situation.\nZahel had insisted.\nBless him.\nSomething clicked in Adolin, and when he next set his peg, he expected\nit to slip. He accounted for it, used it, and incorporated that slip into his\nstance. As he backed away this time, he changed his gait to account for the\npeg, and stopped stumbling or limping. The peg was still a disability, but he\ncould deal with it. If he couldn’t—if he could only fight when\ncircumstances were perfect—then what kind of swordsman was he?\nAbidi seemed to notice as Adolin’s stance became more sure, his dodges\nmore precise. The creature grunted. “Tell the emperor to surrender and\ndeliver himself to me. I will let both of you live.”\n“Why do you care?” Adolin asked, stepping around the fallen throne,\nknocked off its dais.\n“I want him as my servant,” Abidi explained. “His people will serve me\nbetter if I control him.”\nIt was likely true. In exile, Yanagawn would claim to be the true\nmonarch. Even with Dalinar’s deal, a rival dynasty set up by Yanagawn in\nUrithiru would be inconvenient for those ruling Azir.\n“I thought you might bring him to me here in the palace,” the Fused said,\nswiping a few times with his Blade, evidently enjoying the sound of it\ncutting the air. “Still, we can deal. Deliver him, and you live, human. I will\nabandon the pleasure of bleeding you for this price. Where is he?”\nFor a moment, Adolin was confused. Had the Fused not seen Yanagawn\npeek in with the others at the start of the fight? But of course; without his\nrobes and trappings, Yanagawn was just another youth. Abidi hadn’t\nrecognized him. Why would he?\nThe very person Abidi wanted was right outside. It remained quiet in the\nhallway. The forces likely had orders not to attack until Abidi made his play\nto take the emperor prisoner. Suddenly, Adolin didn’t feel so proud of his\nability to survive so long against a Shardbearer. Abidi hadn’t truly wanted\nhim dead, not yet.\nAdolin pretended to think about the offer to gain a little time. Because he\nwas still in serious trouble. Even if he could fight as Zahel had trained him,\neven if he managed to account for the peg, he had next to no chance. He\nneeded an edge. And one occurred to him as he eyed the first table he’d\nhurdled over after entering the room.\nThe one where he’d knocked over some finery set out to please the\nemperor. And Adolin was reminded of evening games with Yanagawn, and\na conversation about a fallen star."

As Abidi\nreplied, Adolin stumbled over and scooped something up off the ground\nwith his left hand.\nAbidi cursed and came in with a direct, flowing strike of the Blade.\nAdolin lifted his left hand, and parried—\n—clang—\n—with an ornate aluminum candelabra.\nI often reflect upon how the world changed that day.

Radiant asked Shallan as she stepped up to confront\nMraize.\nHe was in his own body for once, wearing the finery she’d come to\nassociate with him, with softness, ruffles, and embroidery. It contrasted\nstarkly with the scars on his face, the lean cut of his features, the dangerous\nexpression.\nHe waited for her outside the corridor, and as Shallan left, the way into\nMishram’s prison didn’t vanish. A room with an open hallway at one side\nthat had appeared here in this otherwise featureless grey plane with a black\nsky. The expanse of white-grey stone extended in all directions, into\ninfinity.\nShallan stood between him and the way in. Then Radiant stepped up,\nmade of unsolidified Stormlight—faintly transparent, wisps of it trailing off\nher uniformed figure. Pattern and Testament hovered just inside the\ndoorway to the prison—and Pattern held Testament to keep her back.\nFormless, unfortunately, was there as well. Lurking to Shallan’s left, her\nface a swirl, her hair matching Shallan’s.\n“Do you want me,” Radiant repeated, “to handle this?”\nUsually Shallan simply adopted one persona or another. Lately though,\nRadiant came only when called for, and only in the most extreme situations.\n“I … don’t need you right now,” Shallan said.\n“You’re certain?”\nShallan regarded Mraize, with that half-cocked smile and weaponized\narrogance. Could she handle this? She felt in her pocket, and found the\ndagger she’d stolen from him in their earlier clash. They both knew exactly\nwhat was coming. One had to inflict the other with a fatal wound using anti-\nLight, forcing them to either heal and die, or die from the wound.\nI’m certain I can do this myself, Shallan thought. I’m not sure I could kill\na spren, but this … this I can do.\nRadiant evaporated, retreating to the back of Shallan’s mind. Formless,\nhowever, drew nearer. That frightened Shallan, because while she knew\nshe’d never be fully “better,” she’d thought she’d handled this. She’d\nthought …\n“You should let me pass into that chamber, little knife,” Mraize said,\nstriding forward. “I need to recover the gemstone inside.”"

What am I missing?\n“I basically beat you last time we exchanged knives,” Shallan said.\n“A well-fought clash,” Mraize said, stopping five feet in front of her.\n“But you had help. Do you truly think you can fight me one-on-one?”\nShe wasn’t certain, no. She could fight, and she knew some small\nmeasure of sleight of hand. But Mraize was an expert. Trained by Iyatil,\nwho …\n“Where is Iyatil?” Shallan asked. “I haven’t seen her since we entered.”\n“She’s watching Dalinar,” he said. “I have done my job, as you know,\nwhich was to keep you distracted.”\nIt was reasonable. It was what she’d guessed. Except why would Iyatil\nwatch Dalinar? Dalinar wasn’t looking for Mishram. He had never been\nlooking for Mishram. They’d used him to get into this realm, but once here\n…\nShallan moved on pure instinct as the pieces clicked into place. She\nwhipped out the anti-Stormlight knife, then spun.\nAnd plunged it directly toward the face of Formless.\nKaladin winced, turning away from the farce of a fight where the\nHonorbearers attacked Szeth—who refused to fight back. At least they used\nonly fists and feet. Kaladin and Syl, as instructed, stood with Ishar.\nSzeth, fortunately, managed to scramble free from the pile-on. Full of\nStormlight, he flew backward onto the more open portion of stone near the\nabandoned wagon. His assailants followed, using Surges. Sliding across the\nground, making stones melt.\nDifficult though it was, Kaladin tore his eyes away from the fight and\nfocused on Ishar. How in the world did Kaladin help a being like this, who\nthought himself God?\nStart by talking, he decided. Or getting him talking.\n“You were there?” Kaladin asked. “From the very beginning? Is it true\nthat we … came from another world?”\nIshar turned, ponderous as a shifting mountain, and regarded Kaladin.\n“Yes. We called our world Alaswha. There was a time when I loved it very\nmuch. We are literally the last pieces of our lost homeland here.” He\npaused. “I am not so eager to lose another world, bridgeman. I will fight.”\n“We welcome your help,” Kaladin said, then gestured to Szeth. “But\ndoes it have to be like this? Is this necessary?”\n“A god must be willing to accept the pain of his people. Without pain,\nthere is no joy.”\nNale did not participate in the beating. He stood quietly, watching, his\nblack uniform wrinkled from his time in the bed of the wagon. He looked\nfar more … human because of that. Syl—on Kaladin’s other side—gave a\nsoft gasp each time Szeth took a blow, but Stormlight would keep Szeth\nalive.

He put it to his lips and blew a few hesitant notes.\nNale nodded eagerly.\nIshar heaved a sigh. “What is this?”\n“Um …” Kaladin said, lowering the flute. “The story of the Wandersail\nis about Derethil and—”\n“Yes, I wrote it,” Ishar said.\n“You … what?” Kaladin asked.\n“I wrote it down,” Ishar said absently. “Three thousand years ago, I\nsuppose it was. When Derethil—then so old he could not walk without the\nhelp of his grandson—told me his tale. Much of it was embellishments, I\nexpect. I’ve searched for the islands he mentioned, and although my\nmethods are not exhaustive, I could not find them. This lends credence to\nthe entire thing being a fancy of an old man whose fishing boat got lost in a\nstorm.”\nHe looked at Kaladin. On the field of stone, Szeth cried out in pain.

That he was\ninvolved, perhaps even responsible? He told us about the Shards, and it was\nhis talk that led us to first contact Odium.”\nA cold shock ran through Kaladin.\n“He prefers to leave that part out,” Ishar said. “Strange, how he always\nmanages to worm his way into each and every relevant decision. Like a fly\nthat you can’t swat.”\n“He …” What could Kaladin say after that? He looked at his flute.\n“There’s another story …”\n“Which one?” Ishar asked. “Gasha and the ten assassins?

They looked to the gemstone lying on the floor, cracked. Renarin\ncould see Mishram inside as a black tempest, straining against her confines.\nViolent flashes of red. A miniature Everstorm.\n“He wandered, didn’t he?” Renarin asked. “Trapped in the Spiritual\nRealm, with no way out, as his powers had faded away.”\nHe betrayed his spren as he betrayed me!\n“No,” Renarin said. “What he did to you was terrible, but he did what he\ncould to protect the Sibling.

He himself had often noted how\nslowly time outside passed while he was in visions, the reverse of what\nhappened when he floated in the Spiritual Realm.\nTaravangian could have very easily placed Gav in a vision meant just for\nhim, and caused decades to pass there.\n“What have you done?” Dalinar whispered, horrified.\n“Made a champion,” Taravangian said. “Worthy of you.”\n“If that is really Gavinor,” Dalinar shouted, turning toward Taravangian,\n“then what you’ve done is horrific.

And he is fully willing, per the terms of our\nagreement.”\n“But—”\n“If you wish to denounce me, tell him you didn’t take the throne from his\nfather in all but name. Tell him you didn’t burn down a city with your own\nwife inside.”\n“Gav,” Dalinar said, holding out his hands to the man, “I have made\nmistakes. Terrible ones that I deeply regret. But don’t do this.”\n“Grandfather?” Gavinor said. In that moment … his voice held echoes of\nthe child he’d once been. “Would you die for Alethkar? If I kill you, the\nkingdom is mine beneath Odium. We will join his coalition, and make\nRoshar the greatest power in the cosmere. Isn’t that worth your life?”\nStorms, the coldness in that tone. The hardness in those eyes.\n“It’s nearly time, Dalinar,” Taravangian whispered.\n“I’m not going to fight Gavinor. He has done nothing wrong.”\n“No,” Taravangian said. “It won’t actually be a fight, but you are going\nto kill him, Dalinar. That is how this ends. You will save Alethkar—and\nprotect the cosmere from my influence—with one simple act: the murder of\nan innocent.”\nI find stories of the Knight of Wind to be most intriguing.

I wonder what it knew\nthat we do not.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 34\nAdolin grinned, holding the three-pronged aluminum candelabra that he’d\nused to block Abidi’s Blade. Shaped a little like a fork, the branching\nprongs reminded him of a Marati swordbreaker. At any rate, the sturdy\nmetal construction caught the Blade mere inches from Adolin’s face.\nThe fight dynamics changed.\nAbidi started to try for real, attacking more relentlessly. But Adolin\nfound, here in this dim throne room in a foreign land, a place for a\nswordsman. He fought using knife and sword style, another one that Zahel\nhad drilled into him—though it was not used in formal duels.\nAbidi moved like the wind, and had the power of Plate. But Adolin …\nAdolin cared.\nThat wasn’t always enough. But today he backed it up with a lifetime of\ntraining and an enthusiastic passion for the duel. He focused on dodging\nand parrying, but he engaged instead of running.\nThat shouldn’t have been enough against such a powerful foe, yet time\nbecame as melting wax, moments flowing thickly into one another. Lessons\nresurfaced about not letting the enemy maximize the power of their Plate.\nAs they clashed, Adolin diverted the enemy’s attacks rather than catching\nthem—not letting Abidi shove him backward.\nHe let his enemy overstep, try too hard, stumble and struggle with the\nstrength of his Plate. Abidi could easily overpower him if Adolin tried to pit\ntheir muscles against one another—but it meant nothing if Abidi couldn’t\nland a hit or otherwise leverage the Plate.\nSeconds became as one. Adolin moved like water, or the trembling\nflame. He was as careful and precise as he’d ever been—near to perfect as\nhe incorporated the peg and his unconventional dagger into his style. The\nonly sounds were footsteps. Clangs. Thump of peg on stone or carpet. And\nan increasingly frustrated grunting from the Fused.\n“Why?” Abidi finally demanded. “Why do you even bother? Azir isn’t\nyour land. This isn’t your fight.”\nWhy? Adolin gave it a moment before replying.\n“You made it our fight,” he said. “When you invaded. You unified us as\nnothing has ever been able to do. Alethi tyrants tried and failed, but nothing\nworks like a common enemy.” Adolin hesitated. “Besides. I promised I\nwould help.”\n“Bah!” Abidi said. “You humans and your oaths.”\n“Not an oath,” Adolin whispered, parrying the Shardblade with a clang.\n“A promise.”\nTo him they were different. In ways he was starting to realize were\nimportant, deep down to his core identity.\n“Oh, look out, Szeth!” his spren called.\nSzeth had no opportunity to “look out” because he didn’t know which\ndirection to turn—besides, attacks were coming from all angles. His broken\narm had barely healed. He tried to Lash himself into the air, but the\nStoneward snapped out a whip, wrapping Szeth’s leg, then made the whip"

He tried to Lash himself into the air, but the\nStoneward snapped out a whip, wrapping Szeth’s leg, then made the whip\nhard and unyielding as steel.\nSzeth was yanked back down, and tried to protect himself with his hands\nand arms as attacks came from all sides again. The pain was nearly\nunbearable, new sparks of it flaring up from each punch or kick. They\nforced him to the ground, and the stone became liquid beneath his feet.\n“That’s not good!” Szeth’s spren cried from somewhere. “Um, maybe\nget up, Szeth?”\nHe groaned. A part of him wanted to use his Stormlight to send these\nfools into oblivion. To bring death and destruction. But … was that the right\nchoice?\nWhy, after all of this, did he still not know the right choice? Why\ncouldn’t someone tell him?\nThrough blurry, tearstained eyes, he saw a figure grab him by his loose\nwhite uniform. Szeth blinked, making out his father’s shape. The mouth a\nsnarl, lips parted to show teeth.\nBut the eyes … the eyes were crying.\nNeturo threw him tumbling across the ground. Szeth came to a rest, a\nmass of pains upon pains. He drew in the last of his Stormlight, waiting for\nits healing touch.\n“I yield,” Szeth said, lying there. “Please, I yield.”\n“No.” Ishu’s voice, from farther away. “You are not permitted to yield.\nThis is over only when I say it is, Szeth.”\nSzeth raised his head from the cold stone, looking past six approaching\nfigures. Toward the more distant forms of Kaladin, Nin, and Ishu. He\nblinked.\n“How long?” Szeth forced out.\n“Until you fight and lose,” Ishu called. “I will not stand for this\nweakness, Szeth.”\nHe sighed and slumped back. Though a part of his mind … a part of his\nmind noticed something.\nSix Honorbearers. I was confused at first, not expecting my father among\nthem. Because I fought six before.\nBut including him, there should be seven.\nHe’d counted ten by adding Ishu, Nin, Sivi, and the empty space Szeth\nwas to take. But with both Neturo and Ishu, that double-counted\nBondsmiths.\nThere were only nine accounted for then. The Edgedancer was missing.\nHe forced himself to stand and confront them: familiar faces, including his\nfather and sister. As they struck again, he saw the solution.\nHe’d fought the Edgedancer in Shadesmar alongside Pozen. She hadn’t\nbeen reborn like the others. Why not? Was it because …\nStorms.\nShe was the sole one he’d killed with Nightblood.\nRlain knelt with Renarin by the gemstone prison. As they did, Renarin\nreached out and took Rlain’s hand for support. Rlain looked down, attuning\nJoy, then found that feeling remarkable. How normal it felt, how easily he’d\nresponded to that touch, how much he enjoyed it.\n“We found the prison,” Renarin said. “So … we have to decide. What do\nyou think we should do?”\n“We take it with us, I suppose,” Rlain said. “We hide it deeper in the"

What do\nyou think we should do?”\n“We take it with us, I suppose,” Rlain said. “We hide it deeper in the\nSpiritual Realm.”\n“To wander forever?” Renarin said. “Storms … is that what we’re here\nto do? Find a way to patch the gemstone so she can’t send hints to anyone\nelse, then die in here like Melishi did?”\nBoth fell silent. Rlain attuned Resolve.\n“We could find a way out afterward,” Rlain said. “Or we could take it\nand hide it in Urithiru.”\n“Since that has proven so secure,” Renarin replied. “The enemy has\nbroken in twice in the last year alone!”\n“The Sibling is awake now to stop them.” He said it to Skepticism,\nhowever. The tower might protect from Fused, but what of other humans?\nSomeone would want this prison. It was far too valuable.\nBecause Odium fears her … Rlain thought.\nAnd … what if they did something else with it? This was the god his\npeople had rejected so long ago. Would it be a betrayal to free her now? Or\nwould it instead be poetic?\nWould she just start another war, enraged? Would she kill him, kill\nRenarin? Destroy? Dared he even consider unleashing such a terrible force\nupon the world?\nBe careful, Rlain, Tumi said. Please, be very careful.\nInside the gemstone, Ba-Ado-Mishram had retreated, the tempest\nstilling. As if she was resigned to her fate.\n“You led us to you,” Renarin said. “Why?”\nTo destroy you!\n“Locked in a prison?” Renarin said. “With only the faintest crack from\nwhich to speak?” He surveyed the large heliodor, cracked at one corner,\nperhaps when dropped here by Melishi.\nRlain wondered what it had been like for the human, near the end.\nWandering, likely weak. He looked like he’d died of old age, or he’d run\nout of water over a long period of time. A sad way to die, but then again,\nthis was the man who had orchestrated the betrayal and enslavement of\nRlain’s entire species. So he found he didn’t mind so much that the death\nhad likely been miserable.\nDestroy you, Mishram said, softer. Get … vengeance … She had slowed\nfurther in her gemstone, now looking so very small. She was afraid, alone,\nand trapped.\n“You led us,” Rlain said to the Rhythm of Hope, “because you thought\nwe might help you, didn’t you?”\nSilence. Not even a pulsed rhythm.\nTwo thousand years in a prison. Betrayed, hating all humankind, she still\nhoped for freedom—and she knew if no one ever found her, she’d never get\nout.\n“Defend yourself!” Ishar shouted, his face growing red as Szeth just\ncontinued to take the beating. “You are to be a Herald! Show some pride!”\nKaladin frowned, noticing that the Honorbearers seemed to react to\nIshar’s emotions. Moving more quickly, more aggressively, as he shouted.\n“Ishar,” Kaladin said.\n“Hmm?” Ishar asked. “Was there something else, child?”"

Moving more quickly, more aggressively, as he shouted.\n“Ishar,” Kaladin said.\n“Hmm?” Ishar asked. “Was there something else, child?”\nKaladin felt chilled by how easily Ishar changed from enraged to placid.\nOn the field, the Honorbearers’ attacks calmed.\n“We want to help you,” Syl said, having reappeared—full sized, beside\nKaladin—no longer the flute.\n“That is kind of you,” Ishar said. “But I need no help, not from you two.\nWatch, and do not interfere.”\n“Ishar,” Nale said from the other side. “I think … I think you should\nlisten. We do need help. We’re … we’re not right.”\n“I’ve observed that in you and the others,” Ishar said. “But I have\nbecome the Almighty, and have withstood the darkness.” He narrowed his\neyes. “I hold our bond together, fractured though it is. But, Nale, I do sense\nyour darkness. I feel it in all of you, even Taln. I carry your burden, in part,\nbut I resist it. I am a god.”\n“You took the power of Odium, Ishar,” Nale said. “And it’s corrupting\nyou.”\n“I subsume that power and make it mine. I corrupt it.”\nSyl looked to Kaladin, seeming helpless. He shared the emotion. Even\nthe Wind had stilled, as if she didn’t know what to do either.\n“Stormblessed,” Ishar said, “do you remember what I told you when we\nfirst met in this land?”\n“That I could have an audience with you,” Kaladin said, “if I helped\nSzeth.”\n“Not that,” Ishar said. “I told you how I bolstered the Heralds, and held\ntheir darkness. Do you wish to feel it? I could show you a grief that would\nbreak any mortal. It would break the Heralds, if I allowed it.” He laid his\nhands over his heart. “This is why I am a god. You have your audience. Is\nthis all you wished to do with it? Tell me Midius’s silly tales?”\nThe spren wait, Syl said in his mind. Thousands of them. Worried,\nbecause something dangerous is coming. They are here with us. Kaladin,\nwe have to do something. What?\nKaladin sweated, and felt impotent. He couldn’t help Ishar on such a\ndeadline; that wasn’t how healing worked. Not of the body, and certainly\nnot of the mind.\nSo maybe it was best to try another tactic. “You are a god,” Kaladin said,\n“yet leave your people without choices?”\nIshar growled softly. “You dare question me?”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said. “How can you be a god if nobody worships you?”\n“This entire land worships me!” Ishar said, and Kaladin winced as the\nattacks against Szeth became more violent. “Shinovar, and beyond. They\npray to the Almighty.”\n“Who they think is Tanavast.” Kaladin waved to the Honorbearers.\n“They are directly under your control, aren’t they?

You haven’t become their god, Ishar. They don’t worship you,\nfor they cannot. You’re just another pretender.”\n“How dare you,” Ishar said, his eyes starting to glow.\n“Now,” Kaladin said, chin up, “if you were to release them, and they still\nworshipped you … that would be different.”\n“Child,” Ishar said softly, “I am over seven thousand years old. You\nthink you can trick me into doing as you wish? A god is no god if the\nworship, or even the mild regard, of his inferiors is requisite to his status.”\nHe turned to Kaladin, his back to the swords. “Why are you here?”\n“I—”\n“What do you think you add?” Ishar asked. “I told you before, I did not\nforesee you. It makes no sense that you would come here. You, who are too\nbroken to fight? You, who cannot help with strategy or planning? Dalinar\nsent you because he needed you out of the way. Your part is done, and you\nscramble for relevance. You are not helping. You cannot help. Sit down and\nstop trying to distract me.”\nEach word should have been a spear. Perhaps even a few weeks ago they\nwould have been. A condemnation, when Kaladin had tried so hard to\nprotect and help others. Working until it left him battered beyond\nfunctionality, like a worn-out shield.\nYet something had changed in him. Or had been changing. His worth did\nnot come from whether he helped. Only in whether he tried.\nIshar strode toward the fighting, and Kaladin realized he’d made an\nerror. Playing into the man’s delusions, even to try to manipulate him, felt\nwrong. Underhanded.\nSo instead he spoke words he knew Ishar would ignore, but words that\nneeded to be said. “You aren’t a god, Ishar,” Kaladin said. “You’re a man.\nSeven thousand years old, yes. But still a man. And you need help.”\nIshar stopped and glared at him, blue robes rippling as the Wind … the\nWind started to return.\n“The spren are afraid,” Syl said, stepping up beside Kaladin. “Terrified,\nIshar. They know, as I think you know, that something difficult is coming.\nLet’s face it together. You know you’ve driven them away. Shouldn’t that be\na sign that what you’re doing is wrong?”\n“I have plans for the spren,” Ishar said, a softness to his voice that made\nKaladin’s hair stand on end. “They might fear what is coming. Their fear of\nme should be greater.” He spun and strode toward the fighting, then with a\nfurious tone bellowed, “Of all the things I expected of you, Szeth,\ndisobedience is not one of them! Fight!”\nAnd all attention turned back toward the ragged man wearing white. His\nStormlight starting to fail.\nMuch of what I know of the Knight of Wind, I get from Jasnah\nKholin.

Now head of our order, and a woman who has shown\nmuch patience for a simple Shin bookworm who thinks herself\nworthy of the task of writing this account.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 22\nAdolin kept fighting, and storms …\nHe was growing tired. He’d pushed himself far too hard today, and even\nwith Regrowth and drugs, he was flagging. His leg stump ached, and he felt\nblisters there breaking and—with the sweat of his exertion—making the fit\nslide.\nHe needed a plan to win, not merely survive.\nAbidi fights like many soldiers new to their Shards, he thought. He’ll\nassume that in Plate he’s invulnerable.\nBecause of that, he’d let himself get hit. Unfortunately, Adolin couldn’t\nbreak a section of Plate with a common sword. It would take tens of\nprecisely targeted blows. But Abidi had a lot of training in fighting against\nPlate himself—he would expect Adolin to try to shatter a section.\nSo, for now, that was the strategy Adolin used. He mustered his\nremaining strength and pushed into an offensive. Abidi laughed, as it would\npresumably both expose and tire Adolin. But in this, the Fused was wrong.\nThis was Adolin’s world.\nThis was who Adolin was.\nHe moved as the flickering flame that had found tinder, and became a\nbonfire. The thick moment itself burst aflame, and Adolin found clarity in\nits light.\nThis was his world.\nThis was who he was.\nWith a sword in his hands, everything briefly made sense again. He had\nbeen waiting so, so long for that feeling.\nCrack.\nHis sword hit a section of Plate on Abidi’s left side. The Fused paused,\nshock manifesting in his posture. The mortal had landed a hit on him? Yes,\nthe blow was meaningless, but the mortal had hit him.\nRage seemed to fill Abidi’s movements as he swept through another\nsequence of attacks. Adolin dodged, parried, and at just the right time …\nCrack!\nA second hit on the exact same section of Plate.\n“How?” Abidi demanded. “You are Radiant. You must be!”\n“Do you see Stormlight rising from me?”\n“Then how?”\nHow?\nWhy?\nHe had promised to help Azir. But why?\nBecause his mother had trained him to care. As Dalinar had worked to\nmake Adolin into a weapon, Evi had worked to make Adolin into one that\nhad meaning. There, within the burning clarity of the perfect duel, Adolin\nwent a level deeper. He understood himself in a way otherwise impossible.\nWhy?\nWhy had he always cared so much that his father be perfect? Why be so\nworried, then so furious, when Dalinar proved flawed?\nBecause Evi had believed in Dalinar. Against all evidence, she’d loved\nhim. And Adolin, her little boy, desperately wanted her to be right.\nThat was why. That was the final truth of it. With a sigh, Adolin let go.\nLet her rest, and let his anger flow away like expelled heat from a flame.\nThere were many things Adolin could never become. But this one was"

But this one was\npossible: He could be the man Evi envisioned. A man who cared. A man\nwho fought for a purpose.\nCrack!\nA third hit on that very same section of Plate. That would do it.\nAbidi roared. This was when he would strike, throwing away caution.\nAdolin set one foot, slid a little on his peg, and stepped into the Fused’s\nfurious blow.\nScrape.\nAbidi’s Blade hit right next to Adolin’s shoulder—where he had raised\nhis aluminum candelabra, expertly placing it where he knew the strike\nwould come.\nAdolin, however, did not strike at that section of Plate again—no,\ninstead he rammed his sword straight into the eye slit in the helm. Aligned\nperfectly with the slant of the hole, because Adolin knew that helm like he\nknew his own name.\nOne glowing eye went out, pierced clear through.\nIn any ordinary duel—and many extraordinary ones—that would have\nbeen the end. Unfortunately, against a Fused, it was not. Abidi brushed\naside Adolin’s sword—breaking off about six inches of it, then ripping the\nremnants of the weapon out of Adolin’s hand.\nThat had been his best chance. He’d hoped that with his gemheart\ncracked, Abidi wouldn’t heal. The gamble failed, for Abidi did not fall. He\nreached for Adolin, who was too close to dodge. A gauntleted hand seized\nhim under one arm and lifted him into the air.\nIt was at that moment that Adolin knew for certain nothing he could do\nwould be enough. No matter how good he was with the sword, it wouldn’t\nbe enough. Abidi dropped his Blade—which fell and stuck point-first into\nthe floor—and pulled the remains of Adolin’s sword tip out of his helmet,\nall while Adolin dangled in his grip, helpless.\nThe eye healed and began glowing again.\nSometimes your best wasn’t enough. It was a lesson every general had to\nlearn. Adolin had never expected to learn it in a duel.\n“What was the point of that?” Abidi demanded. “I can’t be killed so\neasily. You know what? Now I will slaughter you, little human prince. I\ndon’t care about your emperor any longer. I just want you to bleed.”\nNot enough. Adolin wasn’t enough.\nMaya was right, he thought, smiling. I am like my father. I rushed in here\nalone. Tried to do this by myself.\n“I will parade your corpse around once the blood is drained from it,”\nAbidi said, holding him up, eyes to burning helmeted eyes. “That will\nterrify the emperor into surrendering, won’t it? Best swordsman alive.\nBah!”\nSwordsman. What was Adolin if he couldn’t win with the sword? He\nasked that question again, and …\nFor once, did not feel condemned by the truth. He didn’t have to be the\nbest anymore. He was like his father, and that … that was all right, in some\ncases.\nWhat had Maya said to him? That someday he’d realize why he was\nreally here?

When Adolin had refused the throne, refused to be a king.\nBecause he’d been too frightened to live up to a reputation he didn’t think\nhe deserved.\nAdolin chuckled.\nAbidi eyed him from within the glowing helm. “Panicked? At your\nend?”\n“Just realizing something important at precisely the wrong moment,”\nAdolin said. Then he whispered, “Yes.”\n“Yes?”\n“I’ll lead them. They don’t need a swordsman. They’ve got plenty. They\nneed a leader.”\nAs Abidi studied him, seeming perplexed, Adolin thought. About his\nfather’s failings and his mother’s faith. About a world that wasn’t fair—and\ndidn’t appear to have a place for him.\nAbout everything having a purpose.\nThen Adolin whispered, “I’ll do it. But I could use a little help right here.\nPlease.”\n“Begging?” Abidi asked. “Delicious!”\n“Please,” Adolin said, eyes squeezed closed. He wasn’t speaking to\nAbidi or even to Maya. It was, he supposed, a prayer. “Help me.”\nA chorus of voices replied in his mind: … Sir?\nWhat … what was that?\nSir!\nAbidi took Adolin in two hands and spun, hurling him toward the stone\nwall only eight feet away—using all the force of a man in Plate. A throw\nlike that could crush steel, let alone flesh.\nSir! the voices cried.\nIn that instant—as Adolin was flung toward his death—a burst of light,\nlike sparks thrown by a hammer on steel, exploded from Abidi and became\na swarm of embers. Which flashed to surround Adolin.\nAdolin crashed back-first into the wall, and the stone broke.\nBut Adolin did not.\nSir! the voices said. He became aware of strength. Metal surrounding\nhim, bolstering him. Protecting him.\nHis Plate.\nHe saw Abidi gape, stripped of his armor, his bloodied face revealed, his\nclothing crumpled, his eyes wide and incredulous.\nAnd Adolin remembered the last time he’d been with his Plate, when\nhe’d …\nWell, he’d asked it to go with his armor standbys, and serve them. It had\nbeen doing so, not distinguishing among the people it had been passed\nbetween.\nSuddenly, the helmet on Adolin’s head went almost completely\ntransparent from the inside, giving him a full range of view. The voices …\nthey were the spren of his Plate. He could feel them inspecting his peg leg\nand … troubleshooting?\nHis leg armor re-formed, becoming tight around the peg and making a\nkind of metal foot beneath. Springy, it was crafted of several curved pieces\nwrapping around one another and forming something like three toes.\nHe felt satisfaction from the spren. This was … a design they knew?\nFrom long ago?\nAdolin stepped forward, pulling away from the cracked wall. Chips fell\naround him as his new foot—not as sensitive as a flesh one, yet remarkably\nsupple and strong enough to lift him in Plate—gave him sure footing."

The product of both of their hopes. He was Adolin Kholin. A man\nwith very good friends.\nSir! the Plate said, sounding satisfied as Adolin made fists and charged\nforward.\n“Oh, songs,” Abidi swore.\nNeturo kept picking Szeth up, pulling him by his clothing, bringing them\nnose to nose. Growling. Angry. Crying.\nIn a moment, Neturo held him even closer, and Szeth—dazed, bloodied\n—heard something. Words forced out between clenched teeth.\n“Please. Help. Us. Son.”\nSzeth’s eyes focused. He saw a face that was a mask of anger, but …\nBut not Neturo’s anger.\n“Please, Szeth.” His father’s voice, so small, as if coming from deep\ninside. “Please. It hurts.”\nNeturo hurled him again. Away from the others. As if trying to keep him\nfrom harm, but then he stalked forward to attack. Puppets. Ishu had made\nthem puppets. Perhaps it was the sole way to bestow the powers he wanted\nto.\nEveryone in this land, Szeth thought, lying again on the stone. Everyone\nhere is kind of a puppet, trapped in that darkness. Ishu thought he was\npreparing them for war, but he only hobbled them. Everyone.\nThe Herald’s madness had spread to the entire land as he Connected to it.\nDriving away the spren. Leaving Shinovar hollow.\n“Szeth!” his spren said, hovering nearby as a slit in the air. “What is\nwrong?”\n“This isn’t my father,” Szeth said. “Not completely.”\nThe six surrounded him and began kicking again.

Can’t you just tell me?”\nThen, his voice again, older, to the Farmer.\n“How do you know what to do?”\nOlder again.

Each time it was less and less a question.\nMore and more a mantra.\nI am Truthless. I do not ask.\nI do as my masters require.\nNever. Again.\nSzeth raised his head, finding his knees as they continued to pummel\nhim. Kicking and hitting. He turned his eyes to the sky, and something\nignited inside him.\nNever. AGAIN.\n“I am my own agent,” Szeth shouted. “I make my own choices. I. Am.\nTHE LAW!”\nLight erupted around him.\nTo this day, I wish I had all the answers. Would that someday, a\nhistorian could make a record with all possible information at her\nfingertips. For example, what was it Ishu did to prepare himself\nfor what he knew the Knights would attempt? It still baffles\nexplanation, as do many Bondsmith arts.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 201\nShallan stabbed at Formless.\nFormless grunted with Shallan’s voice—and barely managed to catch the\nattack with one hand, right before the tip hit her eye.\nFortunately, Shallan was ready with Adolin’s training. She hooked\nFormless’s foot and sent her tumbling to the ground, then followed in a\nsmooth motion—so practiced, she shocked herself with its grace—and\nlanded on top of the other woman. There, Shallan used her momentum to\npush the knife down further, until it touched the face.\nThe anti-Stormlight started to burn away the Lightweaving, revealing\nIyatil’s masked face, hidden by the illusion she’d been wearing this entire\ntime. As before, the entire illusion didn’t fall, just the places where the tip\nof the knife touched.\nI need to be quick, Shallan thought. Before Mraize reacts. With a surge\nof strength, her leverage giving her the extra bit she needed, Shallan\nplunged the dagger into Iyatil’s eye. A killing strike—which immediately\nrequired Stormlight to heal, lest she die.\nIyatil breathed it in by instinct.\nShallan felt a shock as the anti-Stormlight met Stormlight. A flaming\nflash followed, and Iyatil screamed …\n… then fell limp.\nMraize bodychecked Shallan a moment later, throwing her off. She\ncarried the bloodied dagger with her, and scrambled to her feet to protect\nherself. Mraize, however, knelt above Iyatil’s corpse—the Lightweaving\nfalling away.\nHe pulled off the mask to administer aid … but found her dead, one eye\npunctured, a larger hole having burned out the inside of her head. Storms, it\nhad worked. As Shallan had deduced, trying to heal yourself while anti-\nLight was in your system was … not a good idea.\nIt’s the first time I’ve seen her true face, Shallan thought, gazing at a\nwoman with Shin features, middle-aged, far less … alien without the mask.\nMraize knelt back. “I’m free …” he whispered, then looked to her. “How"

I beat that side\nof me, I grew past it, but Formless just kept lingering … I realized that\nwasn’t me, so there was only one other person it could be. I don’t know\nhow she …”\nShallan’s eyes opened wide. The seon—the little spren in the\ncommunications box. When infiltrating the Ghostblood hideout, Shallan\nhad learned it worked for them.\nThat spren had been with her when she’d been creating Formless. It had\nbeen there when she’d explained everything to Adolin after the trip. She’d\ntold Wit, through it, about how she feared she was killing all of her mentors.\nThe seon spren knew it all. If it knew, Mraize and Iyatil knew. That was\nhow they’d played her this entire trip. Storms.\nMraize glanced at her, then his eyes narrowed. “You figured it out? How\nwe knew?”\n“Yes,” she said. “The spren box. Plus, why would Iyatil be watching\nDalinar? Better for you to divide your work: You hunted the visions to see if\nyou could find the prison. Iyatil watched me, to see if I led you here. My\ncondition gave her the perfect cover.”\nMraize looked back at Iyatil. With one hand, he deliberately closed the\neye Shallan hadn’t stabbed. With his other hand, covertly, he slipped\nsomething out of a sheath at Iyatil’s belt.\nA second knife charged with anti-Stormlight. The one that Shallan\ncarried was empty now, dull and useless. Oddly, Shallan saw a glow from\nthe corpse, and worried the knife hadn’t done its job. But that was only\nIyatil’s spren slinking out of her body, a corrupted inkspren from the look of\nit, which became full sized as it emerged.\nIt appeared wounded as it crawled away. Mraize stood up, trying to\ncover what he’d done in taking the knife by pointing at Shallan with his\nother hand. He slipped the knife into his belt, and Shallan didn’t look at it\ndirectly. That had been smooth on his part. He was now armed, while she\nwas practically unarmed.\n“Do we have to do this?” Shallan asked as the two faced off.\n“You just killed my babsk,” he said softly.\n“And freed you.”\n“As I warned you last time, I am bound by my honor. I disliked Iyatil,\nbut it was my privilege to learn under her. Little knife, you’ve now taken a\nfateful step. Before, I was ready to overlook your infractions. No longer.”\nShallan backed away, hand out to ward off Pattern, who was trying to\ncome and help. He came anyway, leaving Testament and sidling up next to\nShallan. Storms, that knife could kill him. She couldn’t let him stay here.\nUnfortunately, again, her heart trembled at the idea of hurting Mraize."

She couldn’t let him stay here.\nUnfortunately, again, her heart trembled at the idea of hurting Mraize.\nHe was brutal, he’d manipulated her, he’d imprisoned Lift and given her to\nthe enemy. At the same time, he had taken Shallan in. Mentored her. And …\nshe admired him. All her fears hadn’t really been about Jasnah, or Navani,\nor anyone else who had cared for her. They had been about him.\nShe worried she’d have to kill him.\n“Mraize,” she said, “this is not the person you need to be.”\n“And what would I be instead?” he asked, his voice soft, dangerous.\n“Prey?”\nShallan nodded to the side, where—Lightweaving by instinct, needing\nno sketch—she created a different version of Mraize. She began picturing\nhim as a Radiant in Shardplate, gazing off toward the horizon. But no …\nthat wasn’t Mraize. That wasn’t what he could be.\nInstead she made a version of him in rugged clothing, walking\nsomewhere bright. A world where the sun was a soft shade of yellow, and\nthe ground was covered in soil, like Shinovar. In this vision, Mraize had\nabandoned the fine clothing for traveler’s gear. On his shoulder, a\nLightweaver patch. In this place of twisting futures, she knew it was a\ngenuine possibility—and hopefully so would he.\nAn offer, not a distraction. “You could be our agent to other worlds,” she\nwhispered. “Like you want. You said you weren’t allowed to visit them\nyet.”\n“I have traveled Shadesmar,” Mraize said, staring—with what she\nthought was genuine longing—at her Lightweaving. “I have met aethers\nand dragons. But no, I was never allowed onto another world.”\nThe illusory Mraize stopped, one foot up on a stone, surveying the\nlandscape. They couldn’t see much of it, as the focus of the Lightweaving\nwas on him. Still, she could see that version of him smile. A genuine, non-\npredatory smile.\n“Don’t press this conflict,” Shallan said to him. “Iyatil was going to try\nto kill me. I fought back. It’s done. The Ghostbloods are finished.”\n“No,” he said, his expression hardening. “Let me tell you what will\nhappen. You will come with me, and we’ll see if Master Thaidakar will\nabsolve your sins if you agree to join us. I will take over the Rosharan\nGhostbloods, then I will travel.”\nHis eyes lingered on that illusion, then he ripped them away from it.\nShallan’s heart broke in that moment.\nHe won’t let you join them, Veil whispered. It’s a lie. He’s too afraid of\nyou now.\nI know, Shallan said to her.\nIs it time for me to take over? Radiant asked.\nShallan examined her emotions and thought back, No. I will do this,\nRadiant.

He should have had a shield. In their few sessions\nwith the sword, Adolin had said, “Only a storming fool goes into a fight\nwithout helm and shield.”\nHe did not have a shield.\nHe did not have a helm.\nHe was leading a force of ten, facing down hundreds.\nColot, the Alethi man with a bit of red in his hair, stood beside him.\n“Why haven’t they attacked?” Yanagawn asked, trying not to sound\nnervous. An emperor shouldn’t be nervous, not even when he was about to\ndie.\n“They’re waiting for something,” Colot said, his eyes narrowed. “That’s\nthe look of soldiers on strict orders—ones they’re having trouble keeping—\nnot to engage. See how the Regals have to keep reminding them to stand\nand not charge? See how they pull eagerly at the line?”\n“They’re waiting,” Kushkam said in Alethi from behind, speaking with\nhis deep, almost musical voice. “But why, Colot?”\nColot just shook his head, baffled.\nYanagawn thought of the four ways to win when you were facing a\nlarger force. Superior defenses or terrain? No, his force here was\nsurrounded. Superior soldiers or tactics? They all had agreed this was a\nfoolish assault, most likely to fail. They were wounded or untrained, so they\ndidn’t have superior soldiers either.\nCould they hope for the third way to win? A random turning of the tides?\nThat seemed … a forlorn hope. No highstorm hitting the supply lines could\nsave his force in this moment. It would take an act of god or Kadasix to—\nThe double doors of the throne room exploded open, slamming to the\nsides with a clatter, as a body soared through them and crunched into the\nwall of the hallway, then thumped to the floor. The body bled orange blood.\nIt groaned and stirred, as Adolin Kholin—in Shardplate painted blue,\nshining between the joints with a flaming orange glow—strode out of the\nthrone room.\nYanagawn gasped as—with a deliberate, powerful stride—Adolin\nwalked over. He rammed his left heel down into the body, crushing the\ngemheart—and, well, the entire rib cage—which released a puff of\nVoidlight. The creature’s eyes went out, and Adolin turned to regard\nYanagawn through a resplendent gleaming helm.\n“Your Majesty,” he said, resting the Blade of Memories on his shoulder,\n“I have reclaimed your Shardblade for you.”\n“I. Am. THE LAW!”\nKaladin stumbled to a halt. He’d been running after Ishar to stop him\nfrom interfering in the fight. Now all grew still, Honorbearers collapsing to\nthe ground, arms raised to shield their eyes against the column of light\nexploding as if from Szeth’s chest.\nThe law. The final ideal of the Skybreakers? But Szeth hadn’t completed\nhis quest.\n“He skipped an oath?” Kaladin demanded, looking at Syl. “Can you do\nthat?”"

Barely any of you even float!”\nKaladin reached Ishar, who stood with a hand in front of his face.\nSuddenly a kind of … shield of Stormlight extended from his hand,\nbecoming almost solid, and blocking his view.\n“Ishar,” Kaladin said. “We need to talk while you see clearly.”\nThe Herald turned to him, then raised an eyebrow. “So. That imitation\nBondsmith, Dalinar, told of my failing last time? Foolish child.” He\nlowered his hand, and the light hit him—but his eyes were glowing with his\nown Stormlight. So bright, Kaladin couldn’t make out his pupils. “I was\nfooled by Dalinar’s clever lies once. Not again. I am prepared with\ncountermeasures. I always learn.”\nHe strode forward, completely unfazed by the speaking of the oath, and\nby the light it released.\nI can say this. I believe the fact that Ishu was bearing some of the\npain of each and every Herald is an extremely relevant point in\nthis analysis. For while he gave the darkness, he indeed held it in\npart.\nI keep returning to this idea. As I feel it should be explored\nfurther.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 201\nAdolin grinned within his helm, exulting in the shock not just of his friends\n—but that of the enemy forces, who roared at Abidi’s death.\nAdolin? Maya’s voice said. Stormfists! What happened? I … She took a\ndeep breath. I panicked when you vanished. I thought you’d died!\nAluminum around the room, he thought. But I handled it. Barely.\nA few flitting Voidspren zipped over to explore what had occurred, then\nretreated to their armies fifty feet away on either side.\n“Noura,” Adolin said. “Time until the deadline?”\nThe vizier started. “Ten minutes,” she said in a nervous voice.\nCould they hold that long? He looked at his force.\n“At least twelve Fused, Adolin,” Notum whispered. “One is taking\ncharge now that Abidi is dead.”\nAdolin had Plate and Blade, but his forces were exhausted, and half of\nthem were wounded or undertrained. Though Hmask had an eager smile,\nthe others seemed to understand. Adolin’s smile died. His friends would\nmostly fall in the first few minutes, slaughtered as he held, surrounded, until\nhe was eventually dragged down and stabbed through the eyes.\nSir? the armor thought.\nTransparent portions filled in his faceplate’s holes, and air began to flow\nup through his armor, refreshing him. With the whole helm transparent, he\ndidn’t need an eyeslit. Well, that was convenient.\nIt wouldn’t make a difference though. The enemy could shatter his shell\nand kill him like a crab on the table for dinner. They began to form up and\nstarted singing one of their chants. The sound filled the hallway, and\nAdolin’s few defenders anxiously pulled together.\nThey had come all this way—they had fought for so long—and they’d\nstill fail."

Adolin, I’m here. Maybe my friends can help!\nI don’t think a few more honorspren will be relevant. I’m sorry. His heart\nbroke as he said it, for he knew how hard she’d worked.\nHonorspren? she asked, with a laugh. You think I went to find a group of\nstuffy honorspren?\nThey’re who I sent you for! Adolin replied.\nNo you didn’t, she replied. Look! See!\nThe scene of the ornate hallway faded around him, and for a moment he\nsaw through her eyes in Shadesmar. This had nearly happened once before,\nat Lasting Integrity, when he’d sensed her emotions and almost seen what\nshe did.\nMaya stood on the bottom of the sphere sea, and with her were others.\nDeadeyes.\nDozens of them. Moving through the beads, emerging like ancient deep-\nsea corpses dredged up by some ship that was casting nets into frozen\nwaters. He probably shouldn’t have been able to see them among the\nspheres like this, but she didn’t see quite as a human did. To her vision the\nspheres faded, almost invisible.\nSuddenly Adolin recognized his mistake. When he had asked Maya to go\nfor the spren, he had meant the honorspren who had been leaving Lasting\nIntegrity. But she’d assumed he was referencing a different group leaving at\nthe same time: the deadeyes who had come to witness the trial.\nThat was why she hadn’t been able to leave them—for they required\nconstant guidance and supervision.\n“Who are they?” Adolin asked, baffled. He didn’t see how deadeyed\nspren, even this many of them, would help.\n“They are those who have been forgotten,” Maya whispered. “Blades\nand Plate who are no longer thought of. Dropped into the sea, lost, buried in\nstone, discarded by time.”\n“They … eventually fade back into Shadesmar,” Adolin said,\nremembering what she’d told him.\n“To wander forever,” she said. “But I haven’t forgotten them. And they,\nlike me, have not forgotten you.”\nA group of the figures stepped closer to him, lurching, eyes mere\nscratches. There were perhaps as many as fifty of them, of a variety of\ntypes, extending back in ranks. Cultivationspren like Maya. Peakspren.\nEven some honorspren, including one nearby, a man with a long beard and\ntattered old uniform. He stepped up to Adolin—as he saw through Maya’s\neyes—and was accompanied by smaller spren riding on his shoulders like\nbarnacles. Plate spren, Adolin realized.\nThe mouths of several deadeyes worked, but as Maya had once been,\nfinding words proved impossible for them. However, Adolin sensed their\nfeelings somehow. Their thoughts. One at a time, each raised their right fist\noverhead, elbow bent in an ancient salute he had seen in old dueling\nfectbooks. He felt, more than heard, what they said.\nYou need allies.\nWe have come."

He felt, more than heard, what they said.\nYou need allies.\nWe have come.\n“But you’ve given so much …” Adolin whispered. “I … I can’t take\nmore.”\nOne of them—an ashspren that was nearly a skeleton—pointed at his\nleg. His missing one, which they seemed able to recognize across realms.\nAdolin didn’t need an explanation. They were wounded. So was he.\nSometimes you had to press forward anyway.\nThe ashspren opened her mouth and forced out a few sounds. “Wa … wa\n… tch …”\n“Watchers,” Adolin said, “at the rim.”\nShe nodded, and he felt her thoughts. Oaths had fallen, but she would not\nlet him fight alone.\n“Because in this case,” Adolin said quietly, “a promise is something\ndeeper than an oath.”\nThe group of them nodded, appearing relieved that he understood.\nMaybe they wouldn’t have phrased it in those exact words, the ones Adolin\nhad been pondering. Maybe it was just semantics and he was a fool; he\nsuspected Kaladin, Shallan, and the other Radiants would disagree with his\ndistinction.\nHe felt it an important one, for him. An oath could be broken, but a\npromise? A promise stood as long as you were still trying. A promise\nunderstood that sometimes your best wasn’t enough. A promise cried with\nyou when all went to Damnation. A promise came to help when you could\nbarely stand. Because a promise knew that sometimes, being there was all\nyou could offer.\n“Once,” Maya said, “we stood against all that was dark. Adolin, we stand\nagain. We. Stand. AGAIN.”\nTears in his eyes, Adolin nodded. Then he raised his arm to salute the\nfallen warriors who had come to fight when others hid in their fortresses.\nIn that moment, Adolin saw Honor. Alive and well.\nIn a flash, Adolin was back in the Azimir palace. Only seconds had\npassed, as no one had moved. And he was crying. He felt Maya and the\nothers there, ready.\nI need nine of them, he sent to her. Blades and Plate.\nThe enemy began to advance from both sides, their songs echoing down\nthe hallway. But Adolin, above the noise, shouted three words.\n“Unoathed! Arm up!”\nHis group of worried soldiers, scouts, and one scribe looked to him.\n“What?” Yanagawn asked, his voice trembling.\nAdolin thrust his hands to the sides, and a ring of Shardblades appeared\naround him in a wide circle, point first into the floor, each with a Plate\nhelmet appearing from white mist, hanging from the pommel.\n“I said,” Adolin commanded, “ARM UP!”\nRenarin glanced out from where he knelt by the gemstone, hoping Shallan\nwould return. He couldn’t see much, but she seemed to be fighting the\nGhostbloods. Quick motions. Figures struggling in silhouette.\n“This is our fault,” Renarin whispered to Rlain beside him.\n“Humankind’s. Peace was possible, but we didn’t want peace. We wanted to\nwin.”\n“We have to let Mishram go,” Rlain whispered. “I … Renarin, I think we"

A singer’s\ndecision.”\nRlain considered. “She might destroy us the moment she gets out.” His\nrhythm changed to Determination, which he hummed a moment. “But …\nwe have to set this right, Renarin.

The listener who had been\nbrave enough to infiltrate his enemies—and then the listener who had been\nkindly enough to see the good in them.\n“Let’s do it,” Renarin said.\nTogether, they picked up the gemstone and raised it high.\nSzeth took a long, calming breath.\nHe stood in a column of light, surrounded by the Honorbearers—each of\nwhom had fallen before him, arms raised to shade their eyes against the\nlight.\nHe felt whole. How long had it been? Whole of body—though he’d been\nout of Stormlight, this moment had restored him. Whole of mind, with clear\nthoughts for once.\nWhole of heart. Having made his own decisions.\nAs the light faded, he looked to his spren, who stood nearby—human\nshaped, full of stars.\n“Thank you,” Szeth said. “For at least trying to help me.”\n“You …” the spren said. “You spoke the Fifth Ideal. Szeth, you’ve\nbecome the law!”\n“Yes,” Szeth said. “I see it now. All men should be the law, spren. All\nmen should follow it not because it is the law, but because they have\ndecided to do so. We should fight it when it is wrong. That is … dangerous,\nbecause men can be right and wrong too. I can be. I will be.”\n“Yes,” the spren said as a certain peace fell over the stone field,\nsprinkled with grass that peeked out of holes. “Yes, I see. I understand.”\nSzeth nodded. “You are the wrong spren for me, I’m afraid.”\n“What?”\n“If I am to choose, I do not choose you. The Skybreakers under Nin are\nwrong and as corrupted as Ishu’s touch on this land. You care not for\npeople, only for rules. I do not care for your training styles, your\nphilosophies, or the ‘truths’ you tell yourselves.” He paused, considering\nthe next action, and decided it was right. “I will seek out the dissenters who\nlive the old ways of the Skybreakers. There, I will find another spren. I\nrelease you from your bond. I wish we could have been friends.”\nImmediately, Szeth felt a ripping sensation. Like when a crusted-over\nbandage is pulled off a wound, pieces of flesh going with it. He gasped and\ndropped to his knees—for while he’d been beaten bloody moments before,\nthose wounds had been physical. This was different."

He would not continue to be used by Nin’s\nSkybreakers. He would find those who did it a better way, or he would\nmake one himself.\n“No,” his spren said, beginning to fade. “No, Szeth!”\nNin’s spren appeared nearby, and Szeth’s spren reached out as if for help.\nThe Herald’s spren shook its head. “How fitting, 12124. This is what\nhappens when you give them too much power. Learn your lesson here, if\nyou are ever allowed to speak oaths again. You have let yourself become an\nattendant to your human, an auxiliary to his will.”\n“Is that …” the shrinking spren said. “Is that so bad?”\n“Your failure proves that it is.”\nSzeth’s spren vanished into the Cognitive Realm. He hoped it would be\nwell in Shadesmar. Their pairing had never been a good one for either of\nthem. Szeth forced himself to his feet, feeling suddenly frail. For although\nin his mind he was a Skybreaker still, he was now powerless. As his\nawareness of his surroundings returned fully, he found Ishu standing a short\ndistance away, Kaladin and Syl behind him.\n“That was,” Ishu said, each word clipped, “among the most idiotic things\nI have ever seen a mortal do. Abandoning your oaths just after the Fifth\nIdeal? You could have been immortal.”\n“I can barely struggle through the life I have been given,” Szeth said. “I\nwish no more of it than that.” He glanced around, seeing his father\ncollapsed on the ground. His sister groaning. They would soon return to\nIshu’s control.\nSo, Szeth strode past them to where Kaladin’s pack had been deposited.\nNearby grass pulled away again as he knelt, leaving a few patches that were\nShin and didn’t move.\nResting on them was a black sword in a silvery sheath.\n“Sword-nimi,” Szeth said, “what do you do with those you eat? Do you\ndestroy their souls forever?”\nWhat, no! Do you destroy things forever when you eat them? No, you\njust change them.\n“What happens to people, when you … touch them?”\nThey go wherever people go when they die. I eat their Investiture, which\ndrips out of me eventually.\nSzeth nodded. That would do. “I have found that I must destroy one last\ntime. It turns out I have need of a sword.”\nOh. Oh, pick me please, Szeth. Pick me! I’m a great sword. I promise!\nSzeth smiled, then reached for the blade.\nA hand seized him on the shoulder. He turned to find Ishu looming over\nhim.\n“Fool man,” Ishu said. “Without Stormlight for you to feed it, that"

This has\ngone far out of control.”\nIshu pulled back his hand, leaving a glowing light Connecting him to\nSzeth. What did that—\nA deep, terrible darkness struck Szeth.\n“See the darkness I hold at bay,” Ishu said. “The sorrow inside the hearts\nof the Heralds, which I have taken upon myself. See our burden.”\nSzeth screamed.\nYanagawn was the first to move. He snatched the helmet from the closest\npommel and threw it on. For a moment Adolin thought he looked comical—\na youth with only a large, heavy helmet.\nThen it resized to him, and the other pieces formed in the air around him\n—hanging for a fraction of a second before slamming together and encasing\nhim. The same flickering glow of firelight emanated from the helmet and\njoints, and again there was no symbol.\nYanagawn seized the Blade from the ground and pulled it free, turning to\nmeet the tide of enemies. Others scrambled to do as Adolin had said,\ngrabbing helms and suiting up.\nAdolin snagged Jaskkeem, the guard from the smuggler’s port, and\nhauled him over to Noura and Rahel. Behind him, Colot and May—each\ngleaming in their new Plate—clashed with oncoming enemies. Adolin\nseized Noura delicately with one hand and gave her the Blade of Memories,\nthe Azish Shardblade.\n“You three go inside this room,” he told them. “Noura, sit on the throne.\nJaskkeem, and Rahel, make sure no one sneaks in while we fight.”\nNoura accepted the Blade and did as he instructed, Rahel and the guard\nfollowing behind. He would check on them soon. For now, he turned to join\nthe eight others …\nNine others?\nWait. He did the math, and realized he’d … Never mind. He needed to\nfight. The enemy had pulled back, shocked by the new development, some\nof them fallen dead with burning eyes. Adolin raised his hand in salute, then\nsummoned Maya as a Blade.\nThank you, he thought.\nLife before death, she replied. Or maybe life after death this time? I\nnever really understood that motto anyway. Let’s kick some Fused ass.\nAdolin joined his nine and thrust out his Blade. As the Fused called for\nthe attack to resume, Adolin stood.\nAnd held.\nKaladin pulled Ishar away from Szeth. “What are you doing? Leave him—”\nHe cut off as he saw his hands, which now trailed that same glowing line\nof light. Some kind of Bondsmith trick?

He hurt everyone he helped. Where he went, his friends died. He\nsurvived only to be a harbinger of death.\nEveryone he ever tried to save was dead. From Teft to Tien. Dozens of\nfaces and more. Bridgemen whose names he’d forgotten, or never known.\nDalinar had sent him to Shinovar to get him out of the way. Nobody ever\nwanted to be with or around Kaladin. Why would they? He hated himself\nenough to recognize the truth.\nHe was worthless. He always had been.\n“Feel it,” Ishar whispered.\nKaladin dropped to the stones, a strangled sound escaping his lips, trying\nto force breath into his lungs—his body taut, rigid. When he felt like this,\nhe just wanted to give up and not move. Today it hit him like a physical\nforce, a suffocating darkness that would crush him. Not out of existence—\nhe’d have blessed that—but into a ball of pain and self-loathing that would\nnever end.\n“Feel it,” Ishar repeated. “This is what the Heralds would all feel, if I did\nnot hold it back. I am why they can function.”\nIshar touched Syl on the forehead and left a line of light as she tried to\nkneel by Kaladin. She gasped and dropped, trembling, huddling into a ball,\nweeping. Nearby, Szeth lay wide-eyed, his lips parted. Immobile.\n“Feel,” Ishar said, “what it is to be me. Feel the pains of a Herald.”\n“Ishar,” Nale said, approaching. “We need to change our plans, Ishar. We\n—”\nIshar touched him on the arm, and Nale dropped, wheezing, trembling.\nKaladin watched it through a daze.\n“You must bear your own madness now, Nale,” Ishar said softly. “But I\nstand at the crux of the Oathpact. I can feel them all. What do you say to my\ndarkness?”\nNale whimpered.\nIshar turned and waved a hand, sending all six Honorbearers to the\nground, moaning—apparently not needing to touch them to push this\ndarkness through their bond.\n“Feel it,” he repeated softly. “Then question me.”\nFor the events surrounding the contest at Urithiru, I must refer\nyou to another volume of this multi-author work.

He kept his eyes on Gav. “Son, he’s using you.”\n“I’ve seen your life, Grandfather,” Gav said. Storms, he sounded so\nmuch like Elhokar. “I’ve lived my father’s life a dozen times over. And\nalways the same theme. No one ever gets to decide. You decide for them.”\nHe swept out with the Blade in a wide attack, nearly clipping Dalinar. “Is it\nimpossible for you to believe I’m not being used? That I’ve decided I want\nthis?”\nAfter twenty years seeing only what Taravangian wanted him to see?\nThe lad might be deciding, but he obviously wasn’t seeing clearly. But if\nGavinor had his father’s stubbornness, there would be little Dalinar could\ndo to persuade him of that fact.\nWhat, then? Just keep dodging?\n“Dalinar,” Taravangian said, appearing beside him. “Did you really come\nto a battle for the fate of the world unarmed?”\n“It wasn’t to be a swordfight,” Dalinar said.\n“Why not?” Taravangian said. “Isn’t this what you want? A battle you\ncan win? But of course, I complicated it, didn’t I? By bringing someone you\ndon’t want to kill. So inconvenient.”\nDalinar drew in Stormlight, the power infusing him, keeping him from\ngetting winded. That helped him stay ahead of the young man, even though\nhe was good. That was probably what you got by training for twenty years,\nalone, under the supervision of a god.\nAs Dalinar passed Taravangian again, the being extended a hand, and a\nShardblade appeared in it—one Dalinar didn’t recognize. He held it out,\npoint down. “Go ahead. Offered without trick or need for payment. So no\none can accuse me of fixing the fight.”\nDalinar ignored him, dodging as Gav—focused, determined—came for\nhim again. Storms, Dalinar was going to make a mistake soon—get backed\nup against the side, or lose his footing. In a fight against a Shardbearer, the\nend could come in the blink of a burning eye. As Gav got too close, Dalinar\nwas forced—almost by instinct—to grab the offered Shardblade and use it\nto block.\nHe heard a dull whimper from the Blade he held. The distant spren, who\nat least wasn’t screaming outright. The next clashes were of Shardblades in\nthe midday sunlight—surrounded by the advancing dark storm. Blades\nflashed, reflecting light.\nThe storm rumbled, and the sun vanished, the air growing colder and\ncolder against the sweat on Dalinar’s brow. It felt like rain was near, with\nthat crispness and sudden cloud cover.\nDalinar backed away, as Gav—sweating, puffing—rounded him.\n“You’re better,” he said softly, “than the versions of you I’ve fought in my\nhome realm.”\n“Gav …” Dalinar said, but the youth was coming in again.

Dalinar met\nhim, Blade against Blade, then shoved him backward—sending him\ntumbling, Blade slipping from his fingers. He scrambled to seize it again.\nTaravangian clicked his tongue. “Careful, son,” he said to Gav. “Don’t\nlet him surprise you.”\n“Don’t call him son,” Dalinar growled.\nTaravangian laced his fingers before himself, watching as Gav reset his\nstance. “My predecessor worked so hard to find a champion. You failed\nhim, then little Stormblessed rejected the call. His final plan had been to use\nthe traitor, Moash. But what would that prove? There’s no poetry to it.”\n“I hate you,” Dalinar whispered, emotions churning in him like wind\nbefore a storm. “I hate you, Taravangian.”\n“Odium,” Taravangian said. “Yes. I provoke that. It is my duty, I\nsuppose.” He snapped his fingers, and Gav suddenly froze in place, sword\nraised for another attack. His eyes quivered; he was aware, but unable to\nmove.\n“What have you done?” Dalinar demanded.\n“Gavinor, by swearing to me, gave me power over him. So I can make\nhim wait.” He looked to Dalinar. “Isn’t this what you want? A good fight to\nend this all?”\n“You know it’s not,” Dalinar said. “Not against Gav.”\n“Then who?” Taravangian said. “One of my most powerful Fused,\nperhaps? Someone you can kill without feeling guilty. Except, of course, for\nthe body of the innocent singer they’re using. There’s always a cost, isn’t\nthere.”\nDalinar backed out of Gav’s reach, in case he unfroze—then tossed the\nShardblade to the ground with a clang.\n“I could provide you with an innocent you don’t know,” Taravangian\nsaid. “A sack over their head, so you don’t have to look them in the eyes,\nplaced on an altar as my champion. Would you pay that price for your\nkingdom’s freedom, Dalinar? Is that what you’d prefer?”\n“Storm you!” Dalinar said, stepping toward him. “There are prices that\naren’t worth paying to win.”\n“I disagree. No price is too high for the greater good.”\n“Just give me a true contest. A real fight.”\n“Do you want the world to be won by strength of arm, then, Dalinar? Or\nwould you rather it be a choice between morals?” He gestured toward Gav,\nstill frozen in place, weapon raised. Tears were forming in his eyes.\n“Here is my champion,” Taravangian said softly, “legally chosen and\nprovided by the appointed time. I cannot fix the fight against you, but there\nis no prohibition against me fixing it for you. This ends when you decide:\nkill him while he watches, or forfeit and die by your own hand.”\nAdolin held.\nWith the Unoathed, he held. Maya in hand and Plate on his back.

The\narmor warned when someone was behind him and provided updates on\nwhich sections were cracked.\nHis friends fought with varying levels of capability—but when you were\nin Plate and holding a Blade, “varying levels” was still extremely\ndangerous. Adolin paired experienced Shardbearers with newcomers, and\ntold those inexperienced to just let loose—not worrying, because their\ncompanions were all in Plate, and could take an accidental hit or two.\nThe result was a tempest of ten shimmering Blades. They killed so many\nenemies that black smoke from burning eyes began to collect at the ceiling.\nIn that wide, lavish hallway, they stood together—ten full Shardbearers\nfighting at once, a feat Adolin had never even heard of.\nIt had an effect. The enemy songs wavered; warforms started to shy\naway. It was glorious. He soon sent Kushkam and his son in to check on\nNoura, and a good thing too, as they returned shortly with a dead Husked\nOne who had slipped past. From the side, Adolin saw Noura and the other\ntwo in there—with the vizier herself standing on the toppled throne.\nWarning, sir! the armor said to Adolin, but not in time to stop a\nMagnified One from slamming into him. Adolin’s armor strained, and\nwarned him the back plate was weakening, until the Magnified One jolted\n—and a Shardblade split her straight between the eyes from behind.\nThe Fused dropped, eyes burning, and Adolin saw a Shardbearer in blue-\nglowing Plate behind her. “Brightlord Adolin?” a familiar masculine voice\nsaid. “Are you well?”\n“Notum?” Adolin said, shaking himself.\n“Indeed,” the Shardbearer said from within his helm. “I do not have\nmuch substance in this realm, but … well, ‘not much’ seems to be enough\nto control this Plate. The windspren have accepted me as their bearer.”\nNotum, full sized but basically just air? They’d always said that the\nstrength of the bearer of the Plate didn’t matter much once the armor was\nactive, but he hadn’t realized quite how far that could go.\nTogether they turned—and found the enemy lines crumbling. Ordinary\nsoldiers fell back, leaving irate Regals and Fused. Adolin didn’t blame the\ncommon soldiers—his Shardbearers had carved up the enemy lines like the\nprized hog at a Lightday feast.\n“It’s working,” Yanagawn said within his armor, grabbing Adolin by the\nshoulder. “It’s working. Position, tactics, even luck … none of that could\naccount for this. But we’re winning anyway.”\nAdolin grinned, and leveled his Blade at one of the Fused, a lithe brand\nwith an Edgedancer’s abilities. The Fused, in turn, looked upward—seeing\nor hearing something Adolin could not. Then he sighed.\nAnd walked away.\nThe others did too. What? Were they that intimidated? Adolin had never\nknown Fused to lose morale—they could often hold lines all on their own.\nBehind them, Noura ran from the throne room, holding aloft her small\nclock. “It’s happened! The time arrived! The Blackthorn’s contest has\nbegun!”"

The Blackthorn’s contest has\nbegun!”\nThe enemy forces seemed to know it. They gathered their wounded—\nthose who had been punched by Plated fists, or had their limbs broken—and\nlaid down their weapons. By the rules that Odium himself had set, they\ncould no longer fight in this land. Adolin looked to Yanagawn, who pulled\noff his helmet, grinning like he’d won his first duel. Which, Adolin\nsupposed, he had.\nWhat now?\nYanagawn spoke to the Fused with the decisive voice of an emperor.\n“Gather your people at the Oathgate, Fused. We will let them withdraw into\nShadesmar. If you have wounded that need care, we will see to them once\nour own are cared for.”\nThe remaining Fused nodded, and began giving orders in their own\nlanguage. Adolin waited, tense, expecting some sort of trick until at last the\nenemy was gone, and his team stepped out into the sunlight of the tenth day.\nTo a free Azir. And so far as he knew, the only kingdom in Roshar other\nthan Urithiru that had stood successfully against the invasion.\nDalinar breathed deeply of the cold air as he rounded Gavinor, the poor lad\nfrozen like a statue.\n“Such a little thing to kill one man,” Taravangian said, “in the name of\npreserving a nation. We had many a conversation about this. Do you\nremember? Sitting before a hearth, or an imitation one …”\n“I remember,” Dalinar whispered. “A time when I thought I could trust\nyou.”\n“You needed someone to talk to who understood the burden of rule. An\nimpossible topic to discuss unless you’ve been there. Musty books full of\nscholars’ debates are all useless compared to the empathy of one man who\nhas watched a city burn, knowing it was necessary.”\n“It was never necessary,” Dalinar said, his breath puffing. “You don’t\nunderstand me, Taravangian. You might pretend to, but you don’t—and the\nway you tried to use visions to break me proves it. I don’t think you care to\nactually understand. You merely want someone to justify your horrible\nactions, to make it easy for you.”\nTaravangian stepped in front of him, his eyes intense, glowing, burning.\n“You think this is easy for me, Dalinar? I can hear children—both singer\nand human—suffer all across Roshar. I cannot close my eyes to it, for I see\nwith divine senses, inextinguishable. I feel their loss, their grief, their pain.\nAll through the cosmere, good people cry out for relief. They will do so\nuntil someone brings peace.”\nHe held Dalinar’s gaze, and continued, his voice barely a whisper. “I was\nready to let go and be done, then destiny wrenched me back. I will do what\nhas been demanded of me. I will be the evil that all men need, but are afraid\nto embrace. There will be no stillness until I bring it by force, until the gods\nstand down or die.

I’ll leave Alethkar alone, and continue my task\nwithout you.”\nAlmost, Dalinar believed Taravangian did this out of a sense of altruism.\nThe passion was there, the commitment. Unfortunately, Dalinar knew\nTaravangian too well. His old friend didn’t just want peace—he wanted to\nbe the one to bring it, his way. In this they were alike, and always had been.\nDalinar looked back to Gav, frozen. All but his eyes, weeping, blinking.\nHe seemed to strain against his bonds.\n“He knows that you betrayed him,” Dalinar said. “Twenty years training,\nfor you to not even give him the chance to defeat me?”\n“A painful lesson,” Taravangian said. “We, at the top, can never have the\npeace we will bring others. We must taint our souls with the worst sludge of\ncorrupt morality, to sacrifice our ideals at the feet of a stable government.\nCome. Choose. Your people expect you to do what needs to be done.”\n“They expect me to be a good man,” Dalinar said.\n“They expect you to pretend to be a good man, so they can sleep at\nnight. What is this one death to you? Your government does worse every\nday. Your non-Radiant Soulcasters? Slowly consumed by their powers to\nprovide food. The darkeyes—the slaves you didn’t want to free—toil,\ngiving their best years to their betters. You let innocent men be hanged so\nthat justice may be applied evenly. You let soldiers die, and children on the\nother side starve, so your people at home can greet each other with cheerful\nmornings.\n“This is the actual nature of virtue and leadership. And if you aren’t\nwilling to dirty your pristine, godly, oh-so-righteous hands with it … then I\nname you a coward. The worst kind of hypocrite.” Taravangian’s grey eyes\ncontinued to burn with a fire behind them, capturing Dalinar’s own, his\nvoice like a held note. “Admit I’m right.”\n“Never,” Dalinar hissed.\n“So be it,” Taravangian said, walking over and taking Oathbringer from\nGavinor’s frozen hand. He walked back, extending it. “Forfeit, and die.\nThat will prove you a fool, but at least you’ll be consistent.” He stepped\ncloser, Blade raised. “Then you’ll rise again as my general, head of my\narmies. Blood and terror shall be your surnames, as the Blackthorn will live\nagain.” Taravangian thrust Oathbringer into the floor of the rooftop in front\nof Dalinar. “It’s the greater evil, but if it’s your choice, I will accept.”\n“You win either way. Whatever I do, you win.”\n“Did you really think I would be here under any other circumstances?”\nTaravangian left the sword and backed away, the darkness behind\nmanifesting as a billowing red storm.

It was to be alive.\nSo he could accept the pain of failing Iyatil and letting her die—yet at\nthe same time he could glory in freedom. Never again would she hold him\nback. Never again would he fume at her prohibitions, her rules.\nHe had survived her. He was their leader now. He would have had\nShallan as his own acolyte, trained in a better path—controlled not through\npunishment, but through information. But she refused. He respected her fire\nand ambition. She had been trained well, after all.\nNow she needed to be eliminated. For if you could not control the beast,\nthen it was your duty to put it down. He smiled as he approached her. She\nstood next to that Lightweaving she’d made of him, the tempting one that\nimagined him as a Radiant.\n“We can talk,” he said, ignoring that illusion. “Service to me will not be\nso harsh as you imagine, Shallan. I am capable of many revelations that will\nbe … illustrative to you. Perhaps we can travel those worlds together. I\nknow how you hunger to see them.”\nShe made the false illusion step toward him, which gave him pause as he\nregarded it, trying to determine if there was some trick here. It puffed away\na second later. A distraction? He looked back and met her eyes, which\nseemed afraid. Concerned. Or was he reading her expression wrong? She\nhad grown proficient at hiding what she was feeling.\nHe prowled forward, and she shifted, one foot to the other. Such odd\nbehavior … but ah, another distraction, yes. Her spren had moved to the\nside, and Mraize caught sight of it dashing toward him in a sudden rush. It\nwas trying to tackle him, but Mraize set his stance. It collided with him\nweakly; it was just a Cryptic, with no battle sense. Mraize easily deflected\nit, sending it to the ground.\nMraize almost struck at it with his knife, annoyance rising in him as he\neyed Shallan and growled. A desperate move on her part—she must have\nseen the knife he’d taken from his babsk’s corpse, hidden in his pocket.\n“You send your spren,” he said, “hoping I’ll wound it and leave myself\nunarmed? Ruthless, little knife. I didn’t know you had it in you.” He\nglanced toward the other Cryptic—still at the doorway into the prison. The\nsick one. “Yet I suppose it is not your first time sacrificing a spren.”"

The Lightweaving\nfell away, revealing her true self.\n“I’m sorry,” Mraize said as she struggled in his grip. He slipped the knife\nfrom his pocket and raised it. “Almost, you made me wish I could be the\nman you imagine. How do you do that?”\n“By caring,” Shallan said quietly. “And by lying.” Her eyes flicked to his\ndagger.\nWhich did not glow with that light that warped the air. Instead he held\nher drained knife—while the one she held, which had almost struck him—\nwarped the air.\nWhat?\nWhen she tried to tackle me, he thought. It was a cover for swapping the\nknives!\nGreat Gods of Fallen Worlds … how? How had she become that good at\nsleight of hand? For the first time in this fight, he started to worry.\n“You have a choice, Mraize,” she said. “You always have a choice. Don’t\nforce this.”\nIf you don’t kill her, he thought, then she will kill you.\nIt was the way of these things. He met her eyes.\nThis was the moment.\nHe dropped his useless knife and twisted her wrist with both hands,\nmaking her scream and drop her glowing knife. He snatched it from the air\nas she scrambled for the one he’d dropped. In a flash they met, him\nramming his knife into her chest, and her driving hers into his stomach.\nA sudden, blazing, burning tore through his abdomen.\nHe gasped at her as the anti-Stormlight surged through his body. “H …\nhow?”\n“I’m not good enough to slip a knife out of your pocket and replace it,”\nShallan said. “But I’ve always been great with a calculated lie. You always\nheld the knife that could have killed me, but you dropped it.” She brought\nher face close to his as his strength faded. “I have a choice too. I make it\nnow. The choice to no longer let myself be abused.”\nShe rammed the knife in deeper. Mraize felt his life fading as she sought\nhis heart, and despite himself—too inexperienced with his powers to do\notherwise—he breathed in Stormlight.\nIn a second, fire consumed all. Like a sunrise burning away night.\nVenli knew the deadline had arrived when El finally called his guards away\nfrom watching the Oathgate. He’d been expecting some sort of attack right\nup until that moment.\nIt was then that she acknowledged it at last: her plan had worked. El\nhadn’t seen what they were doing.

El blinked\nonce, then turned to regard the group of them as if for the first time.\n“Excuse me?” he said.\nVenli reached into the pocket of her cloak, to an oiled and protected\npouch. From within she took a roll of papers signed by Jasnah, the human\nqueen.\nA treaty.\nAfter seven long years at war, the Alethi and listeners had finally made\npeace. Venli handed the papers to Thude, who held them up. A treaty signed\nby Gavilar’s heir—daughter of the man they’d killed on the night of the\nprevious treaty signing.\nThis one would hold. They had vowed it.\nEl took the treaty and read it quietly. “You arranged this how?”\n“With great care,” Venli said. “The humans knew the plateaus were lost,\nand together we agreed that a friendly party in control was preferable to an\nunfriendly one.”\n“This is our land,” Bila said. “The humans did the right thing in\nacknowledging that on paper.”\n“They are willing to do the right thing occasionally,” El said softly,\n“when it is the only option.”\n“This is stupidity!” one of El’s companions, a Magnified One, shouted to\nFury. “We will just take it from these little ones!” He drew back his hand to\nswing at Venli, and while Leshwi and the others tried to intervene, it was El\nwho moved first.

We’ll send\nambassadors. I should have liked to own this land, but this is not an\nunacceptable outcome. It offers … different opportunities.”\nHe returned the treaty and walked away, calling for his forces to retreat.\nA second storm had begun to build on the top of Urithiru. The highstorm.\nDalinar noted it, as one might note the first rays of dawn. A … herald of\nthings to come. A glimmer of hope.\nWas there any possible way out of this?\nHe looked again toward Gav, who stood with his arms raised to kill—but\nwith no weapon in them. His sword, Oathbringer—the symbol of both\nDalinar’s greatest sin, and his attempts at redemption—scoring the roof\nnearby.\nGavinor was crying. It was such a cheap trick, to use him as a pawn—\nbut at the same time, Dalinar understood the greater message here.\nTaravangian could have used some unnamed innocent just as easily, as this\nwasn’t about whether or not Dalinar was the better fighter. It was to force\nhim to agree, one way or another, with Taravangian.\nKill Gav, and Taravangian’s philosophy proved correct. Walk away, and\nDalinar would be forced to join him in advancing that philosophy anyway.\nHe’s right though, isn’t he? Dalinar thought. It’s better that I kill one\nperson now, to free Alethkar. Although he hated the way this had happened,\nGav had chosen …\nDamnation. No. Dalinar wouldn’t accept that line of reasoning. A child\ntaken by a monster and lied to for decades could not be held accountable for\nthis decision. If Dalinar killed him, he would at least do himself—and Gav\n—the dignity of not blaming the lad.\nIt would be so easy. Few monarchs would have hesitated for long. It\ngives Taravangian what he wants most, he thought. The chance to corrupt\nme.\nBut the other choice? To join Odium? To launch wars that spanned the\nvoid between worlds? That was … that was what humankind had already\ndone, essentially, in coming to Roshar.\nPerhaps … perhaps he could do that. Perhaps he could manage those\nwars, so they didn’t get too terrible. Was it the worst thing, to have a\ncapable general in the command structure, preventing atrocities? Plus, he\ncould surely wage war against other worlds without getting too emotionally\ninvolved. It was nothing more than he and Gavilar had done in uniting\nAlethkar—simply on a grander scale.\nThat seemed … a terrible perversion of the goals he’d spent the last few\nyears seeking.

The unity he still felt a true God had commanded him to\nbring. To do what Taravangian wished … that would be to reject Dalinar’s\nbudding faith, and join a quest he knew was evil. That was far worse than\nkilling one young man.\nStorms. He gazed at Gav. Remembering the child he’d played with, held,\nrejoiced over. A child he’d seen mere hours ago, by his mental reckoning.\nCould it be that … that Taravangian had been right all along? That this was\nthe actual way of kings? Not Nohadon’s platitudes about helping. A deeper,\ndarker truth: that a king’s duty was to take upon him the sins of an entire\ngovernment.\nThe Stormfather formed as a shimmer beside him, and Dalinar realized\nhe saw the spren as a friend. An occasionally combative one, yes, but …\nwell, Dalinar had few friends he hadn’t at some point wanted to punch.\nHe’d followed through with more than a couple.\n“Do you have an answer for me?” Dalinar asked.\nThe Stormfather shook his head. “I’m sorry.”\n“Dalinar?” Taravangian asked from behind, near the far railing,\nstreaming with the darkness that fed his storm. “Shall we talk further?”\n“I could … go with him,” Dalinar whispered. “Become his Fused, but\nthen ignore his orders to fight. He can’t compel me.”\n“I think he might be able to,” the Stormfather said. “He may be able to\nremake you, Dalinar, as the Unmade were created. It requires your\npermission, but the contract …”\nThe contract would give that.\n“It is hard,” Taravangian said, “to have one’s morals legitimately tested,\nisn’t it? To find yourself at the crossroads of what you’ve said and what you\nhave lived. I know, Dalinar. Trust me, I know. And I am sorry.”\nStorm that man. He sounded so …\nNot reasonable. Relatable. Taravangian had been in Dalinar’s position,\nand had been forced to make these choices. It was as Dalinar had feared.\nAll of his searching, all of his work, was for nothing. In the end, Odium\ncontrolled this confrontation utterly.\nNo, Dalinar thought. The journey. I learned.\nHe raised his hands to the sides, cold wind blowing across him, and he\nlooked out across the peaks, feeling …\nLife. Perhaps it was an echo of his visions. Perhaps it was that sense of\nwarmth, the one he sometimes knew during quiet hours in his study.\nPerhaps it was the time, the place, the company.\nHe felt them. The people of the tower, of the surrounding nations, of\nAlethkar, of the world. He felt their fear, their love, their dreams. Some of\nthem hurt, as Odium said. That was terrible, but it was also life. And life\ncould be painful.\nMost didn’t know what he was doing, nor could they really care. Other\nneeds were too pressing, too immediate.

He knew in that moment the\ndeepest lie that Taravangian told: that only “great” men had difficult choices\nto make. That only kings carried burdens of guilt. That he was somehow\nspecial in needing to make painful decisions.\nDalinar’s power was vast, so his choices were influential, but they were\nnot unique.\nYes, something familiar said in Dalinar’s mind. See …\nHe had seen. He had strode the path of history, coming to Urithiru not by\nconventional means, but by walking time itself. He had been singer, Herald,\nhuman, god. In the Spiritual Realm, he had seen what Connected them all.\nLast of all, he stood here, knowing weakness. Not being enough … like a\nyoung man he loved who celebrated now in Azimir.\nNot enough …\nYou could never be smart enough. Jasnah had learned that. Nor could\nyou just keep fighting forever. Kaladin had learned that. You couldn’t be\nstrong enough, nor could you be perfectly honorable. That was what it was\nto be mortal. Sometimes you succeeded anyway. Sometimes you failed.\nDalinar had experienced the breaking of oath after oath. Humans turning on\nsingers. Singers turning from Honor to Odium. He’d even seen a god trying,\nas best he could, and finding no way out but to break his word.\nYes. Dalinar felt that voice. The power of Honor. It HURTS. Why must it\nhurt? Can humans not simply do as they say that they will?\nThis—the power of Honor—was one person he hadn’t yet\nacknowledged. One he’d seen, but hadn’t considered. He did so now, seeing\nthrough the eyes of the power itself.\nPerson after person had failed it, making it tremble with agony.\nAwareness blossomed in Dalinar. And there, at the crux of two storms,\nDalinar Kholin understood.\n“Stormfather,” he said. “I know the Words!”\nAnd the existence of those several key people is the one thing that\nI myself have heard from the Wind. This singular truth, a nugget\nthat I cannot yet explain.\n“One is not enough. The change must come from many.”\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 237\nShallan dropped the expended knife, exhausted, falling to her knees beside\nMraize’s corpse. It was lucky he hadn’t seen, at the last moment, that the tip\nof the real knife—with the anti-Light—had burned through her illusion. But\nshe’d successfully kept his attention on her. Misdirection within\nmisdirection. And it had worked. He was dead.\nAnd she felt exhausted rather than triumphant.\nPattern bounced over, still wearing the Lightweaving that made him look\nlike Shallan. A too-tall version of her, which was likely what had tipped\nMraize off. Then Radiant was kneeling across the body from her. Blond,\nwith a thicker neck, stronger muscles, and a calm smile.\n“You did it all on your own, Shallan,” Radiant said. “You killed him\nyourself. You don’t need me to do that anymore, do you?”\n“No,” Shallan whispered. “Thank you.”"

She was the part of Shallan that had killed her mother,\nkilled her father, and borne the weight of fighting. She’d emerged as a\npersona after Tyn’s death and formed into Radiant some weeks later—but\nas Veil had carried Shallan’s memories, Radiant had carried her violence.\n“I know it hurts,” Radiant said, glancing at Mraize, whose dead face was\nfrozen in a mask of surprise and agony.\n“It does,” Shallan said. “But not … not because of what I did, but\nbecause of his decisions. I am not responsible for his bad choices … or the\nconsequences of them.”\nRadiant reached across, gripped Shallan on the shoulder, and squeezed.\nThen they were one.\n“Is that … it?” Pattern said in her voice. That was disorienting enough\nthat she dismissed the illusion. Testament joined them. Quiet as always.\n“Shallan?” Pattern said. “Are you healed?”\n“That’s not how it works,” she said, feeling so exceptionally tired. It had\nbeen … a very long day. “I will always have to fight my mind’s\ninclinations. It’s not that I’m healed, or even that Radiant is gone\ncompletely.” She stood up. “But I am better than I was.”\nMraize started glowing, then his skin rippled.\n“Here,” she said, reaching down and helping to pull the wounded spren\nfrom his body: a bone-white Cryptic, with a head pattern that was all\nwrong. Loose loops like scribbles instead of geometric shapes.\n“I …” the Cryptic said. “I am sorry. But I hate you. Mmmm … it is a\nstrong hate.”\n“You will have to deal with that,” Shallan said, inspecting the Cryptic’s\nleft side, which had been burned away—leaving a hole where the arm and\nshoulder should have been. She glanced to Iyatil’s inkspren, who was\nradiant with colors to show its changed nature—and was huddling in the\nshadows nearby. “Is there a way to heal you?”\n“I do not know,” the Cryptic said. “You burned away the part of us that\nis Stormlight, not the part that is Voidlight. I … I feel sad. And hurt. I do not\nwant to talk to you.”\nShallan didn’t blame him. She looked to Pattern, who helped her get the\nwounded Cryptic to his feet. Perhaps if they brought them to Sja-anat, she\ncould do something?\nShe started toward the room with the prison. In the fight, she’d almost\nforgotten it. As she drew near, she could barely make out something\nhorrifying inside.\nRenarin and Rlain with the gemstone raised high. Poised to drop it,\nshatter it, and release Mishram.\nOh, storms.\nNale, called Nalan’Elin, huddled on the ground and tried to stop existing.\nIt wasn’t that this darkness was new, but he’d … he’d been able to hide\nfrom it.

She could barely reach out, her very essence twisted in agony. She’d\nfelt something like this before, in trying to empathize with Kaladin and\npeople like him, but experiencing it like this was so, so different.\nIt made her feel completely alone.\n“Know my pain,” Ishar was saying, though she barely heard. “As you\nfeel it, let me have peace. To think.”\nSo, so alone. What had she ever done that had mattered? She felt a\nsqueezing within her, rearranging her until she …\nShe wanted to not be. It wasn’t pain. It was the opposite of pain. It was a\ndeep, terrible nothing.\nIt terrified her more than anything else ever had.\nSzeth was exhausted.\nHow long was he expected to keep going? What was the point of all this\nfighting?\nEach new thought was of how he’d failed. The eyes of someone he’d\nkilled. Whispers in the darkness.\nHe was overwhelmed.

Why had he tried so hard?\nCouldn’t he just sleep for once?\nYet sleep seemed too easy an escape for one such as him.\nSzeth?\nThe sword. Szeth ignored it.\nSzeth, what is wrong?\nEverything was wrong. It always would be. Szeth squeezed his eyes\nshut, curled up, and trembled.\nKaladin lay there, grappling with the darkness.\n“I made a fool’s choice, didn’t I?” Ishar said. “To think that any mortal\ncould ever deserve to be a Herald. I must move forward with another plan.\nDissolve the Oathpact. Yes, dissolve it, bring the spren through to this\nrealm, and make them my army.”\nThoughts intruded and stabbed Kaladin’s mind, like spears in his flesh,\nmaking him scream his flaws. Those he’d lost. Those he’d failed. Storms,\nhe hated this part.\nStill, there was nothing to do about it. So Kaladin raised his head and\nlooked up.\nSo often, it began with just looking up. That was the first step in clawing\nfree of this darkness. With eyes blurred by tears, he thought he saw\nsomeone … standing there in front of him. Kaladin himself.\nYoung Kaladin, standing up to volunteer to join the military because his\nbrother had been taken.\nBeside him, Squadleader Kaladin, on the battlefield and sheltering the\nnew recruits.\nThen Bridgeman Kaladin, forcing his friends to carry a bridge on its\nside.\nCaptain Kaladin, who stood to protect Elhokar against even a friend.\nRadiant Kaladin, battling Szeth in the sky.\nHe looked at all the dead men he’d been, and realized something.

Was that terrible? The darkness inside him said it was, that\nhe’d end up going in the same circles as before. That darkness … in it, he\nfelt the burdens of the nine remaining Heralds. The people who had\nsacrificed so much for the world, and lost themselves because of it. Was that\na warning? That he shouldn’t try?\nKaladin fought that feeling off, for he had a new tool. He had learned,\nand grown, while helping Szeth. Storms … by helping, he’d learned. He\nwasn’t perfect at it, but he had boundaries now. He refused to take Szeth’s\nfailings upon himself, refused to let failure crush him.\nThe change to become this newest version of himself wasn’t about\nabandoning what he admired about himself. It was only about finding a\nhealthy way to handle it.\nAnd so, in the face of the most awful darkness he’d ever felt, Kaladin\nStormblessed took a deep breath.\nThen stood up.\nI can’t speak to that. But I can speak to the testimony of one man’s\nexperience. That of what it felt like to be in the very depths of\ndespair, and then to have someone stand up and try their best to\nshield you from it.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 237\nKaladin stood up to protect Szeth, Syl, and even Ishar. Not because he had\nto. Not because the situation forced him into it. But because this WAS the\nman he wanted to be.\nIshar cut off his rambling and turned to look at him, eyes widening.\nEveryone else on that barren field of rock lay on the ground, curled up,\ntrembling, eyelids clenched shut. Even Syl was incapacitated. Like Kaladin,\nNale, and Szeth, she had a cord of white light leading to Ishar.\nIn that moment, Kaladin understood why he had come here. He felt the\nWind herself take a welcome gasp. His invisible armor—and, it seemed,\nthousands of windspren, somewhere—found wonder in this simple act. A\nman standing up.\n“Impossible,” Ishar said. “What are you?”\n“I’m just an old spear who wouldn’t break, Ishar.”\nHe stepped sideways in front of Szeth, putting himself between Ishar and\nhis friend. It was perhaps a hollow gesture, but there was a darkness\nemanating from Ishar—and maybe Kaladin could shield others from it, like\none could in standing before a terrible storm. Indeed, Szeth opened his eyes.\nIshar stalked toward Kaladin. “I don’t believe it.” He looked at Kaladin’s\ncord, then back at him. “How?”\n“This horrible darkness,” Kaladin said. “That’s what you feel?”\n“Every day.”\n“It’s awful, isn’t it?”\nIshar nodded."

But Ishar, you will be warm again. And that is another thing\nentirely to promise.”\n“I … I don’t know if that is true,” Ishar whispered. “It’s different for us.”\n“It’s not,” Kaladin said. “I feel your pain now, and I see what it is. Your\nlives might be supernatural, Ishar, but what you feel is what I feel. I realize\nthat on one hand, that is no consolation. Your pain, your sorrow—your\ndarkness—doesn’t transform because another experienced it. Still, it seems\nto help, doesn’t it? Knowing you aren’t alone.”\nIt was difficult to even speak. Kaladin wasn’t lying; he had felt this\nbefore—but whatever Ishar had done to him was worse than most of his\ndays. It was like all of the worst days Kaladin had known distilled into 200\nproof awfulness. The Horneater white of misery.\nThis was worse than the days when he didn’t want to move.

Days like the one\nwhen he’d stood in the rain above a chasm long ago.\nThat was what the Heralds lived with.\nStorms, Kaladin thought. I have to help them.\nIt was a laughable thought. How could he help? He was barely\nfunctional. It was all he could do to stand there.\nBut stand. Kaladin. DID.\nAnd somehow it helped. Seeing someone else resist helped. Szeth,\ngroaning, managed to look up at him. Syl stirred.\n“How?” Ishar repeated. “What are you?” He gestured toward Szeth.\n“Are you … are you his spren? His god?”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “I’m his therapist.”\nIshar blinked. “… What is that?”\n“I honestly have no idea,” Kaladin admitted.\nIshar moved with a crash of speed. A pop, and a rush, and suddenly he\nwas there with a hand at Kaladin’s throat. “I will crush you. You will fall\nhere, Stormblessed. You cannot help. You cannot stop me. Everyone you\nlove will die for this insolence. Doesn’t that terrify you?”\n“Yes,” Kaladin admitted.\nThe darkness wanted him to see himself failing.

The Words that both soldier and surgeon needed\nto learn eventually.\nTwo halves of one man. A singular lesson.\nA step forward from what he’d learned in storm and tempest two weeks\nago, Words said in agony.

Trying earnestly to work with\nTanavast—but finding him infuriatingly uncaring about oaths.\n“I see your pain,” Dalinar whispered.\nLines of light—dozens, hundreds—began to appear at his chest,\nvanishing into nothing, tethering him to … to something distant. Or\nsomething here, but in another realm.\nYou … the power whispered. You are the uniter.\nYes. He had followed the command to unite them. He’d brought\nAlethkar together, forged a cohesive nation out of squabbling highprinces.\nThen he’d brought nations together in his coalition. Stumbles\nnotwithstanding, he and Navani had built this tower and its people into a\ntrue kingdom.\nThose lines of light strengthened.\n“I know you want a successor,” Dalinar said.\nHumans lie, the power said. I have watched them lie. Every one of them\nlies. The lies hurt.\n“I saw,” Dalinar said. “I do not think you’ll do better than me, right now.\nI have grown so much, even in the past ten days.” Dalinar had learned the\nlessons of those who had failed. He was ready. Ready to take the next step.\nThe lines of light … stayed the same. The power didn’t care about\nDalinar’s willingness to serve. Why not?\nIt is the power of Honor and oaths, Dalinar thought. Not of self-\nimprovement. It doesn’t care if I’ve grown. It cares if I will keep my word.\nDalinar thought of the many oaths he’d made, and kept. Promises to\nhimself, to others. Including as recently as sending Radiants with the Mink,\nwhen it had hurt his war efforts. And yet … he found himself uncertain.\nWas he really a man of his word? He’d told Elhokar that he didn’t want\nthe throne, had sworn it to Sadeas, vowed he’d never be king … but then\nhe’d taken that throne in all but name.\nThe power didn’t care. So long as Dalinar technically hadn’t taken the\nthrone, all was well.\nThat bothered him. This power had a certain immaturity he had not\nthought to find in something deific. But … he supposed it was relatively\nnewly aware.\nIt is time, Dalinar. That was … Cultivation’s voice. Speak the Words. You\nknow them now.\nHe did.

Then he spoke to Honor the most important Words he\nmight ever say. Words that only worked if he could say them truly.\n“I understand you.”\nThe Wind itself accepted his Words.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 249\nThese Words, the Wind whispered to Kaladin, are accepted.\nKaladin came alight with an explosion of power.\nAnd Ishar, poor Ishar, was still Connected to him by that Bondsmith’s\ntether. In the moment the final Words were spoken, power surged through\nthat very tether, along with a wave of Light from Kaladin, which threw\nIshar back with a physical force. He slammed against a natural rock pillar,\nwashed in pure light from the Spiritual Realm.\nKaladin felt he could see the power of the Fifth Ideal pushing back the\nblackness through that tether, like a drain being flooded in the wrong\ndirection, until it reached Ishar and he gasped again. Black smoke exploded\nout of the Herald, pushed from his pores like Stormlight.\nKaladin distinctly thought he heard, echoing through that failing bond,\nthe gasps of eight other people as an unacknowledged darkness left them.\nAn oppressive cloud that Ishar thought he’d been holding back, but had in\nreality been infecting every Herald. The blackness he’d absorbed from\nOdium centuries ago, by finding his pool of power.\nIt wouldn’t heal them, lifting this dark cloud. Their wounds stretched\nback millennia before Ishar’s terrible decision. However, this might help\nopen a path to healing.\nIshar, with one final gasp, slumped against the ground, dazed and\nperhaps unconscious. Kaladin, still glowing, noticed that the tethers were\nstill there. So he knelt and seized Nightblood by the hilt, whipping the\nsword from its sheath. Power began to be pulled from Kaladin, but he held\nso much from the Fifth Ideal that it seemed trivial.\nUsing the sword, Kaladin carefully severed the cords coming from Ishar,\nfreeing Syl, Nale, and Szeth. The last vestiges of that darkness faded,\nleaving only a memory. Szeth let out a sigh of relief. Syl laughed.\nNearby, Ishar’s Honorbearers stirred, and started to rise. And storms …\nthat darkness continued to hang over them. That shadow upon the land …\nKaladin could see it manifest in all six, whose faces became masks of rage\nand anger as they gathered. They’d been created from that darkness, so this\nwasn’t over.\nKaladin set down the black sword—but noticed, as he did, that a line of\ndarkness remained attached to his hand. His Stormlight continued to drain,\nvanishing, as if he were expending it on some great task.\nI have learned from the other swords, Nightblood said in his mind. I\nknow the Surges. I will Connect to you. You will feed me!\n“Nightblood,” Kaladin whispered, “let go.”"

If there was fighting to\nbe finished today, Szeth needed to do it. So Kaladin tossed the black sword\nto him—and that line of darkness connecting him to the weapon stretched.\nFeeding from Kaladin’s Stormlight, and not from Szeth’s soul.\nSzeth lifted the weapon high.\nKaladin, in turn, helped Syl rise.\n“Kaladin,” she whispered, “what have you done?”\n“Figured myself out, finally,” he said, with a smile. He looked toward\nSzeth. “We need to leave this next part to him.”\nSzeth held up the black sword, using Kaladin’s Stormlight to sustain them\nboth.\nDestroy evil! Nightblood cried, inky black liquid dripping from the blade\n—but almost all of it evaporating before it hit the ground.\n“No, sword-nimi,” Szeth said. “Today, we simply restore what is right.”\nThe six Honorbearers surrounded him, each with a Blade of their own.\nIshu was down, but his anger raged in them. These things that had been\nmade from Szeth’s family and mentors … they were abominations. Yet as\nhe regarded them—Nightblood boiling in front of him—he read something\nnew in their expressions. He’d once seen anger: teeth gritted in fury, eyes\nwide with contempt. Now he saw pain. Teeth gritted at being made puppets,\neyes wide at the horror of what they were forced to do.\n“Oh, Father,” he whispered. “I’ve been there. I have walked that road. I\nunderstand.”\nNeturo wept openly as he gripped his Blade. “I’m sorry,” he said through\ngritted teeth. “Szeth, I’m so sorry.”\nHe seemed to think that six against one was unfair odds. The one,\nhowever, was Szeth. “Sword-nimi,” he whispered. “You have created a\nbond to Kaladin. Does this mean you have been learning Surges from the\nHonorblades? Can you return to me my Lashings?”\nYes, the sword said. I can restore your Lashings. Those are easy. Even a\nspren can give those. Now we fight? We finally FIGHT?\nSzeth felt a distinct chill in his right palm. Hopefully Kaladin’s\nStormlight would hold, for otherwise the sword would consume them both.\nFor now, Szeth had what he needed. His Lashings, and more. How long had\nit been since he’d been able to give his heart entirely to a fight? Not with\nthe Skybreakers, not while puppeted by Taravangian’s strings, not even at"

Not with\nthe Skybreakers, not while puppeted by Taravangian’s strings, not even at\nthe Battle of Thaylen Field.\nIt had been since he’d first picked up a Blade, and found it a dance.\n“Yes,” he whispered to Nightblood. “Now we fight.”\nThe perpendicularity glowed with an awesome power, a star atop Urithiru,\nmaking everything white.\n“Dalinar?” Taravangian said, his voice calm as he spoke from within his\nstorm. “What do you think you’re doing?”\n“I cannot face you as a man and win, Taravangian,” Dalinar said. “It is\ntime for Honor to return.”\n“It cannot return to you,” Taravangian said. “The power rejects\nhumankind. It will reject you in particular, because you are an oathbreaker.”\n“Then explain what is happening,” Dalinar said, expanding that column\nof Light.\nFor once, in all the time they’d known each other, Taravangian\napparently had no idea how to reply.\nDalinar reached through that perpendicularity. Come on! he said to the\npower. You are needed!\nIt flooded around him, but did not enter him. He felt he was in a vision,\nbut there was nothing to see. Greyness, and an infinite expanse of nothing,\nformless. But with glistening power in the sky, infinite and wonderful.\n“Why?” Dalinar said. “Why do you hesitate?”\nI … Humankind … The pain … Except …\nIn a flash, Dalinar saw a revelation: two people holding a gemstone\nprison. The Bridger of Minds. The Son of Thorns.\nOn the edge of a proverbial cliff, and a future no one—not even the gods\n—could see.\nRenarin and Rlain held the gemstone high.\nRlain attuned Determination, his hand next to Renarin’s, glad to be here\nwith this man at his side.\nShallan called for them to stop. They both glanced at her, then at each\nother. Ignoring her cries.\n“You sure?” Renarin asked.\n“Yes. You?”\n“Yes,” Renarin said to Determination.\nTogether they slammed the gemstone down against the ground, where it\nshattered completely, and a dark storm escaped it.\nThe curious effect that the Black Sword has on individuals is one\nthat I find poorly recorded. It is true that many feel nausea when\npicking it up, which is a sign of a heart uncorrupted by greed.\nOthers are, then, corrupted by that greed.\nMost interesting are those in between. Those who feel neither\nemotion. Those who can use the sword, but walk a fine line upon\nits edge.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 266\nKaladin stood back with Syl, watching Szeth fight, and marveled.

        "text": "promenade—running up along it. As he crested it and the stone tried to\nenvelop him, Nightblood destroyed it in a burst of smoke.\nSzeth landed amid a group of five enemies and blocked their blows\neasily, throwing sparks from their Blades—breaking off chips from them,\ntossing their bearers back. He scattered enemies, but they kept scrambling\nto attack him again. Every time, Szeth somehow pressed the advantage\nagainst overwhelming odds. He moved as, and with, the wind. As the\nStoneward tried to grab him, Szeth slid along the ground and touched her\nleg. The woman went careening into the air.\n“The Wind aids him …” Kaladin whispered.\nNo. We fear him.\nThat startled Kaladin, and he glanced to the sides, to see pinpricks of\nlight hovering around him. Windspren? His armor. They had never spoken\nto him before.\nWait. If those were the spren of his armor … why were there so many?\nFading in and out, vanishing as soon as he could see them in the air. He felt\n…\nThousands of them. Watching on the other side. With them the Wind\nherself, the ancient soul of Roshar. As if all of the wind on Roshar was\nholding its breath here, in this moment.\nTo the east, through the spren, he felt the land tremble.\nSomething terrible was happening at Urithiru.\nDalinar felt the moment Renarin and Rlain released Ba-Ado-Mishram. A\nlong-lasting discordant note, vibrating the soul of Roshar in the most\nterrible of ways, was finally extinguished.\nSomething that had been broken—for so very long—righted.\nDalinar strode toward Odium, the power of Honor surrounding him. He\nsaw it, true honor, in the efforts of two young people to set right an ancient\nwrong. In the way a young spearman rose to his feet in the darkness. In a\nman who stood with friends to save a city that was not his own. In the\nLightweaver who refused the lies and accepted truth. Even in the way a\nqueen who had been wrong resolved to do better.\nHe saw it in what Alethkar had been, and what it had become. In\nhimself. If the man who burned cities could be redeemed, then who could\nnot?\nThat was honor. The power couldn’t see it, and that still troubled Dalinar,\nbut he could.\nFortunately, with the release of Mishram accomplished—her betrayal the\nvery thing that had broken Tanavast—the path became clear. That sin had\nbeen holding the power back all these centuries, but now it thirsted for a\nVessel, and Dalinar had seen its existence and its failings.\nIt wanted someone who understood it. That was the budding humanity of\nit, the budding awareness. Like all sapient things, it wanted to be\nunderstood. And thus, with that Connection, the power that had been\nostracized at long last returned.\nHonor was born again in Dalinar Kholin.\nSzeth was free.\nReleased from an eternal prison. He … he could dance again.\nHe spun among the Honorbearers, Nightblood laughing as he sprayed\ndark mist around them.\nHe was alive.\nSzeth-son-Neturo was alive."

Because\nit was time, past time. He needed to bring peace to these people. So he\nstopped stalling and slid on a Lashing across the ground. Two slashed\nbehind him, but missed, as Szeth placed himself right in front of Pozen. The\nold Honorbearer reached out with rage in his eyes to try to send Szeth to\nShadesmar.\n“Thank you,” Szeth said, thrusting with the midnight sword, “for your\ntraining.” Pozen, his first teacher, exploded into black smoke and his Blade\nwent flying, clanging to the ground in the distance.\nSzeth Lashed himself backward—abruptly moving in an unnatural way,\nto anyone not used to Lashings. He left four confused assailants trying to\nswing at him as he turned, wind in his face, and located a rock formation\nthat hadn’t been there a moment earlier. He drove his blade straight into it,\nconsuming it in a burst of black smoke.\n“Farewell, Moss,” Szeth said, tears on his cheeks, as the Lightweaving\nvanished around the stones, revealing a man being consumed by\nNightblood. “The only one of you to be an actual friend. May you rest at\nlast.”\nBa-Ado-Mishram filled the small chamber with a billowing black smoke.\nRlain lost sight of Shallan outside—even lost track of his surroundings. He\nput a hand out to one wall through the darkness.\nThat darkness formed a sphere around him and Renarin, and then\nMishram appeared from the smoke—with hands like claws. She loomed\nover Renarin like a vengeful shadow, fingers making knifelike nails, eyes\nblazing red.\nRlain attuned Resolve and leaped forward, seizing Renarin, sheltering\nhim, and turned to Mishram. “NO.”\n“He is one of them,” she growled.\n“He freed you. He did what was right, because it is right!”\n“He was a fool! They imprisoned me. They lied to me! He is evil!”\n“He is a person,” Rlain shouted.\n“He is human!” she shouted back.\n“Some are evil, some are good. Most are both! Just like us, and until we\naccept that, nothing will ever change!”\n“Nothing changed for me in two thousand years!”\n“It changed for us,” Rlain said. He pulled Renarin closer, then attuned\nLove. “It changed for us, Mishram.”\nThe Rhythm of Spite beat around them like thunder. Yet she did not\nstrike. She screamed—and an explosion of light followed. Rlain clung to\nRenarin, and they fell through the floor. Renarin shouted, and all was\nblackness and light, somehow mixing, until with a jolt they hit the ground.\nRlain twisted, groaning. When his vision recovered, he found himself\nand Renarin lying with Shallan and the spren on one of the Oathgate\nplateaus of Urithiru. The version in Shadesmar, with its strange black sky\nand odd clouds.\nThey had been ejected from the Spiritual Realm. And deposited near\nwhere they’d begun this journey."

        "text": "plateaus of Urithiru. The version in Shadesmar, with its strange black sky\nand odd clouds.\nThey had been ejected from the Spiritual Realm. And deposited near\nwhere they’d begun this journey.\nSzeth landed softly on the stones as a third Blade clanged to the ground at\nhis feet. A third foe killed, this time the Stoneward. That left him with only\nthree. His sister, the Dustbringer. The older Truthwatcher woman whose\nname he had never learned. Finally, his father.\nSzeth hesitated, his hand sweaty on Nightblood’s grip.\nFight! the sword said. DESTROY!\nThe feeling of the battle had changed. Neturo’s head jerked, as if forced\nto move. He nodded to the Truthwatcher. That oddest of orders, the one\nSzeth had understood the least, even when using its Blade.\nThe Truthwatcher strode forward, a globe of light forming in her hands.\nShadows came alive. Szeth stumbled back as they crawled from the\ndarkness around him. Transparent figures. That one … that was the old\nAlethi king. That one a bandit from Bavland. There, a serving woman at the\nVeden feast …\nGuards. Common darkeyes. Kings. Shardbearers.\nThe people Szeth had killed. The whispers.\nThe whispers were alive. Each one pointed at Szeth. Accusatory.\nSzeth spun around, trying to face them all, waving Nightblood—though\nhis hand was starting to hurt, black tendrils moving up his wrist. An oath\nspoken had brought great power to Kaladin, but Nightblood searched for\neven more. Darkness moved like veins under the skin, corruption seeking\nSzeth’s heart. The sword was looking to feast upon his soul.\nSzeth! Nightblood demanded. We must kill!\nA Blade flashed from among the clustering shadows. Szeth parried by\ninstinct, knocking away the Blade. His sister emerged from among the dead.\n“You ruined everything, Szeth. Before you bashed out that soldier’s brains,\nour life was perfect. You sent Mother away. You broke Father. You ripped\nour family apart.”\n“I know,” he said, tears on his cheeks.\n“I’m going to kill you for that,” she said, circling him like a predator,\nturning her Blade in her hand. “I’m not going to hold back this time. You\ndeserve it.”\n“I do,” Szeth said as the shadows drew closer. “But Elid … you don’t.”\n“Don’t deserve to die?”\n“Don’t deserve that burden,” Szeth whispered. “You don’t deserve any\nof this … what Ishu has done to you. What I did to our family. I wish I\ncould restore you.” He blinked tears from the corners of his eyes as he saw\nthat she, when she moved, trailed a faint shadow. Like … like he had done,\nto some eyes, after being healed from near death.\nExcept where his was white, hers was red.\n“I can’t spare you though,” Szeth said. “You aren’t alive any longer,\nElid. You’re something else.”\nShe growled, raising her sword toward him. The shadows surrounded\nSzeth, and he realized as they touched him … if they took him, he could not\nhelp his sister.\nNone of them were real. They never had been real. Like a stone revered"

Like a stone revered\nand carried without purpose, they were … nothing.\nIgnoring them didn’t make them go away, but it did steal their power. As\nElid lunged, he turned aside her Blade. She appeared shocked by this—\nshe’d thought he would be taken down by his madness. Her lunge brought\nthem face-to-face, and Szeth kissed her on the forehead.\nThen he swept Nightblood through her, bringing peace to his sister and\nsending her Blade clattering to the ground, digging a gouge out of the\nstones.\nThose who were not there, you future readers, understand. Even\nhundreds of miles away from the event, I heard the thunder.\nThe land trembled at what Dalinar Kholin did.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 181\nDalinar’s mind expanded.\nHe could see it all. Past, present, potential futures.\nHis body evaporated into the substance that was the vast,\nincomprehensible essence of godhood. What stepped forward from that\npower to meet Taravangian was merely a projection that towed infinity\nbehind it like a cloak.\nYou have done it, the Stormfather said, awed, his voice so very, very tiny\nnow. A puff of air against a raging highstorm. Dalinar, Honor, could meet\nTaravangian on equal terms. And could consider a third option apart from\nthe two he’d been offered.\nWhat if he destroyed Odium? The contract of old let Dalinar attack as he\nwished. Yes, Odium could defend himself if that happened, but Dalinar had\nbeen a soldier and Taravangian a philosopher.\nDalinar could destroy his enemy and save Roshar. The power of Honor\nwanted this confrontation. Dalinar, in a moment of infinite lucidity, saw that\nthis was part of why it had broken away from Tanavast. Of what he had\nworried, he now saw the fulfillment: Honor, in the power’s eyes, was about\noaths. But there was a darker side to it.\nHow many men had stabbed someone they loved because of “honor”?\nHow many wars had been started because of an insult to “honor”?\nHow much anger in the world had been caused by a belief in “honor”?\nThe power accepted those definitions of it. It was the power of oaths and\nthe pride that men bore at being thought of as men of oaths. As Dalinar had\nwitnessed: thousands of years of warfare to prove who was right, and who\ndeserved this land. The power didn’t care about self-improvement, but it\ncared deeply about being right.\n“S ,” Taravangian said, “T ?”\nO HIS IS WHAT IT COMES TO\n“I ,” Dalinar found himself replying.\nT IS THE ONLY WAY\n“I ,” Taravangian said. “I I H ,\nACCEPT F CAN ANNIHILATE THE POWER OF ONOR\n, I .”\nSPLINTER IT COMPLETELY THEN WILL BE FREED\nDalinar.

On the top of the tower, he heard Gavinor crying, suddenly freed\nas Taravangian focused on Dalinar. Crying … the way he had as a child …\nDalinar remembered his first vision ever, standing and watching a\ncataclysm engulf his homeland. How many times had he seen that vision,\nand assumed the cataclysm was some enemy force? Some terrible fate he\nneeded to stand before and prevent?\nNow, he saw it clearly for the first time. The cataclysm was Dalinar\nhimself.\nHe was there, frantically punching Elhokar again.\n“Stop.”\nHe burned Evi because it was what the people of the Rift deserved. It\nwas retribution for breaking the treaty they’d sworn an oath to follow.\n“We can’t do this.”\nHis people had killed tens of thousands of Parshendi on the Plains,\npursuing the Vengeance Pact in the name of honor and oaths broken.\n“No,” Dalinar said, backing down from the fight with Odium. “Never.”\nThis had never been his plan upon taking the power, but he’d been swept up\nin the moment. Now he refused. Now … he had the power …\nAnd he still needed another solution.\nLight surrounded Dalinar. A moment later, he vanished. Drawn into one\nfinal vision.\nKaladin and Syl knelt beside Ishar, who seemed conscious—but barely. He\nstared at the sky, not blinking, and hardly stirred as Kaladin lifted him to a\nseated position.\nStorms, Kaladin thought. Nightblood was using up Light at a furious rate\n—even though Kaladin had felt minutes ago like he was holding it full to\nbursting. As he waved his hand in front of Ishar’s dazed eyes, he found frost\non his clothing. He breathed in to restore his Light, and found nearly all of\nhis gemstones already empty. Storms.\n“That’s bad,” Syl said, glancing at the black lines forming on his hand\naround where the cord tethered him to Nightblood. “This is dangerous.”\n“I know,” he said. “Ishar. Can you hear me? Can you use the Bondsmith\nBlade to open a perpendicularity? We need more Stormlight.”\nPlease, he thought. Please have worked."

Please have worked.\nKaladin found it remarkable how easily the final Words had come to\nhim. He’d expected so much pain from it, and yet … the Fourth Ideal had\nbeen his biggest stumbling block. After admitting he couldn’t help\neveryone, with a little time he came to the natural ultimate conclusion—that\nif he wanted to keep doing what he could do, he’d need to look out for\nhimself.\n“Kaladin,” Syl said, resting her hand on his arm and staring at the sky,\n“the spren feel something coming.”\nThe sky was shimmering more brightly now.\n“What is it?” Kaladin asked.\nThey know, the Wind whispered, that we stand upon a cliffside. Dalinar\nKholin faces his greatest challenge.\n“And what will happen?” Kaladin asked, feeling cold.\nIt is not written, the Wind said. Not yet. But be ready, Kaladin. Please.\nBe ready.\nSweat on his temples crystallized to ice in an extremely strange\nsensation. Fortunately, Ishar finally groaned, blinking. He focused on\nKaladin.\n“Stormblessed,” he whispered. “What did you do to me?”\n“Depends,” Kaladin said. “How do you feel?”\n“Like a mountain fell on me,” Ishar said. He coughed and leaned\nforward, then his eyes found Szeth, still fighting the spirits. “Oh. Oh no.\nWhat have I done …?”\nWell, that was a good sign.\n“Can you stop them?” Kaladin asked.\n“I …” Ishar held his hand before him. “I have no power … no Surges\n…”\nNale stumbled up to them, looking confused, a hand to his head. Kaladin\ndidn’t have time for them at the moment though. He yanked a pouch from\nIshar’s belt, then breathed in the Stormlight inside, feeding Nightblood.\nIt’s coming, the Wind said, and her voice seemed to echo. As if there\nwere a thousand versions of it overlapping. You say you’ll help … but I’m\nsuddenly afraid. Will you still curse me because you continue to live?\n“No,” Kaladin promised. “Never again.”\nWill you be there? When I need you?\n“Have I ever not been?” he said—though moments later a sharp pain\nstruck his hand. He cried out, then raised his hand to find the black veins\nrunning up his forearm.\nKaladin breathed in, searching for more Stormlight, but Ishar was\ncompletely tapped. He looked to Nale, who shook his head. Nothing.\nNightblood would soon consume Kaladin.\nPerhaps Nightblood would consume them all.\nDalinar appeared somewhere warm, with light coming in through windows\nthat was somehow … softer than other light. More blurry, like he saw it\nthrough eyes that couldn’t focus. He could see the room around him better\nthough: it was an antiquated stone chamber, full of the belongings gathered\nin a long life, well lived.\nWooden bowls on one counter.

Paintings on one wall, of an older style:\ndepicting mountains and rainfalls in black and grey ink, with the slightest\nwashings of red and blue. A few hung askew, but not because of some\ndisaster. They had just slipped, and nobody had righted them yet. Dalinar\nlooked out the window and saw only a soft light that didn’t blind him, but\nwashed out whatever there was to see.\nHe could hear sounds out there: people chatting, individual voices\nindistinguishable, but the talk was bright and energetic. The sounds of a\nwinehouse with people laughing, or perhaps a market …\nBlood of my fathers, Dalinar thought. Dare I hope? Have I finally come\nback here … to him …\nIn a daze, he walked to the door and pushed it open. In the small kitchen\nbeyond, he found a shorter man with an Alethi or Veden look about him.\nSilver hair, pointed beard. Smile lines and simple, old-fashioned grey robes,\nembroidered red and yellow. He was working at an archaic oven, all stone\nand brick, with a front that could not be closed.\nNohadon. The ancient king who had written The Way of Kings.\n“Oh, thank the storms,” Dalinar whispered.\n“What?” Nohadon said, reaching into the oven with a flat metal tool.\n“The visions have been terrible lately,” Dalinar said. “I worried this one\nwould be twisted somehow.” He said it, though he didn’t expect that to\nmake sense to Nohadon. Still, the previous time he’d seen this man …\nHadn’t he called Dalinar by name? Despite being in a vision of the past?\n“You’re surprised to find me, Dalinar?” Nohadon said. “I promised you\nShin bread, my friend. I usually keep my promises.” He pulled a thick loaf\nof bread from the oven, made in the strange Shin style that Dalinar—after\nshopping for ingredients with this man in a vision the year before—had\nasked to try in the real world.\nNohadon gestured for him to sit at the small table on the floor nearby.\nDalinar did so, and the ancient king—moving with a spry sense of\nexcitement—slid the bread onto the tabletop. “Perfect!” he said, poking it.\n“Exactly the right mix of crust and fluffiness! I’d be embarrassed if it had\nbeen a dud, considering the importance of the moment.”\n“What is this?” Dalinar said, feeling so … surreal. The warmth, the room\nthat seemed to fuzz, a softness to each corner or edge. “Did I create this?\nI’m Honor now. I’m creating visions?”\n“Ha!” Nohadon said, settling down. “A god for less than five minutes,\nand already you think you control everything.” He took a knife and cut into\nthe bread, steam rising from the fluffy insides. Dalinar liked a good\nflatbread with his meals, but this stuff had just tasted … wrong.

The final confrontation between Odium and Honor.”\n“I would counter,” Nohadon said, “that this is the most important time\nfor you to be reminded of lazy days baking bread. Why do you fight, if not\nfor days like these?” He took a healthy bite. “What happened?”\n“I nearly destroyed it all,” Dalinar admitted. “It was so tempting to fight\nhim, knowing I could win.”\n“Except …”\n“Except that would destroy too much,” Dalinar said. “I realized it. I\nstopped myself.”\n“That’s progress, my friend.”\n“Is there no way to fight him?” Dalinar said. “Without destroying all of\nRoshar?”\n“I don’t think there is,” Nohadon said. “Powers like yours have clashed\nbefore without destructive results—but always then, one of the two wanted\nto preserve. When both want to destroy … it’s violent.”\n“So that puts me right back where I started!” Dalinar said. “I have the\npower of a god, but I still cannot see a way out. Either I kill my\ngrandnephew, or I serve Odium.” He put his hands on his head, leaning\nforward, elbows on the table.\nThe power of Honor let him see so much farther. But Odium could see\nthat distance as well, and had designed this trap so there was no way out. “I\nhave to be strong. I must do as you would do, Nohadon.”\n“And what would I do?” the elderly king asked.\n“Make the right choice,” Dalinar said. “Refuse to kill Gav. Accept this\nmeans serving Odium.”\n“Interesting,” Nohadon said. “Wouldn’t that give Odium everything he\nwants? If you willingly serve him, then many of the Radiants will go with\nyou. He would ostensibly be trapped here on Roshar, so the other gods will\ncontinue to ignore him—but he’d have access to the finest military in the\nwhole of the cosmere. He’d have time to plan, build, and raise a new force\nof Fused who aren’t suffering from mental fatigue. In a hundred years or so,\nhe’d be able to launch his armies and conquer everything with ease.”\nDalinar narrowed his eyes at the old king. “Who are you, really?”\n“Perhaps merely a construction of your mind,” he said. “Or maybe I’m\nactually Nohadon. Well, I was born with the name Bajerden, but no one\nseems to like that one.”\n“You can’t be encouraging me to kill Gav!” Dalinar slammed his fist to\nthe table. “Nohadon wouldn’t kill a child to achieve his goals!”\n“Dalinar,” Nohadon said. “I did so all the time. Every policy I made hurt\nsomeone.”\nDalinar hesitated. In this room, he didn’t feel like a god. He felt like …\njust a man talking to another man. “So … killing Gavinor is the right\nanswer?”\n“I didn’t say that,” Nohadon replied. “Only that sometimes, we all have"

Not just kings, Dalinar. Did you see that?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “I did.”\n“Every parent must choose themselves or their child, every day—\nsometimes multiple times a day. When to play. When to rest. Every decision\nwe make influences others, and sometimes harms them. That’s not the way\nof kings. That’s the way of life.”\n“So you would kill the boy,” Dalinar said.\n“Would I?”\n“I don’t know,” Dalinar said, attempting to remain angry, though this\nplace had a soothing quality. He sat back, sighing. “What do I do?”\n“I suggest,” Nohadon said, pushing the loaf in Dalinar’s direction, “you\nhave a slice of bread.”\nDalinar paused, then cut a slice. “I did try this stuff. I didn’t much care\nfor it.”\n“How’d you eat it?”\n“With my dinner.”\n“With curry and hot spices, no doubt,” Nohadon said, clicking his\ntongue. “This is Shin bread, Dalinar. Eat it their way. With salted butter.”\n“Butter? Why? That’s for cooking.”\n“Here,” Nohadon said, demonstrating by spreading the stuff from a\nblock onto a slice of bread.\nDalinar hesitantly did as instructed. Then he tried the bread, and found it\na different experience entirely. Light, tasty, with a hint of salt and oil. It was\ndelicious.\n“Too much yeast, I think,” Nohadon noted.\n“No, it’s perfect,” Dalinar said, taking another bite. “Much better than\nwhat I got at Urithiru.”\n“Good, good,” Nohadon said. “I suppose context matters both with bread\nand with decisions. What’s your context, Dalinar?”\n“An evil god,” Dalinar said, “wearing the face of a man I once called a\nfriend. Putting me in an impossible situation. I keep thinking of the first\nvision I ever saw. That of my homeland falling to a destructive wave.”\n“This one?” Nohadon said.\nAnd they were standing there, pieces of bread still in hand. Upon a cliff\noverlooking Kholinar, the home he’d not seen in so many years. The gem of\nGavilar’s conquest.\nIt was the first vision, the first and the last. Each time he’d stood here,\nDalinar had felt like a different man. He watched it play out again, the\nground falling away, a terrible destructive wall of something overwhelming\nKholinar and breaking it apart completely. Darkness of unfathomable depth\nswallowing all.\n“What does it mean?” Nohadon said.\n“I am the destruction,” Dalinar said, pointing. “A clash between me and\nOdium would destroy this world.”\nTanavast was always too weak to take this step, the Stormfather\nwhispered in Dalinar’s head from someplace distant. He … I … spent so\nlong searching for someone who wouldn’t dare do it. Maybe … I was\nwrong. Could I have been wrong?\n“No,” Dalinar said, confident."

Could I have been wrong?\n“No,” Dalinar said, confident.\nNohadon put his hand on Dalinar’s shoulder, gesturing to the vision of\nKholinar. “Are you sure this represents the destruction you’d cause by\nclashing with Odium?”\n“What else could it mean?” Dalinar asked.\n“I don’t know,” Nohadon replied. He took a bite of bread. “A\nconundrum. But I suppose you are here, at this decision point, and not\nsomeone else. So maybe only you can know.”\nThe wave of destruction reached the cliff upon which Dalinar stood, and\nall started falling. Breaking.\nHe appeared back in Nohadon’s kitchen. Slice of bread in his fingers. He\nsighed, leaning forward. “I’m so tired of this question, Nohadon.”\n“And what question is that?”\n“How to defeat Odium!”\n“And what does defeating him look like?” Nohadon said.\n“I don’t know!” Dalinar said. “That’s the problem.”\n“Paint for me the picture,” Nohadon replied, “of what a perfect outcome\nlooks like to you.”\nDalinar hesitated, then ate more of the bread, considering. “Wit told a\nstory, with the point being to not lose sight of the everyday lives of the\npeople. Navani told me to make what feels the best decision in the moment.\nI think … I think what I want, then, is peace. Without compromising my\nvalues.”\n“What kind of peace?” Nohadon asked. “Enforced? No ability to\nchoose?”\n“That … serves him, doesn’t it?” Dalinar said. “Taravangian’s\npredecessor spent millennia—all of the wars—trying to build himself\nunstoppable armies. That didn’t work, as it merely broke us. With enforced\npeace though, Taravangian can recruit, train, marshal his forces—pick\ncareful engagements offworld to build veteran experience. That’s how you\ntrain a military.” Dalinar put his hands to his head. “I need to break the\ncycle of constant battle.”\n“So that is what victory looks like to you?”\n“Everything serves him!” Dalinar said, standing up, pacing. “Every\npossible outcome! Peace serves him, war serves him! Everything I could\nthink of, everything I could do!” He stopped by one of those windows,\nbathed in the strange light. “I can’t defeat him … Storms, I really just\ncan’t.”\n“Who can?”\nDalinar looked back at Nohadon, who met his eyes.\nWho can?\nA thought occurred to him. And a knock came at the door right after.\nNohadon rose and answered it, ushering in an Alethi child—perhaps nine or\nten—of indistinguishable gender. He patted them on the head, gave them\nsome bread, and sat them by the hearth to watch the flames.\n“Strange,” Nohadon said, walking up to Dalinar, “how one so ancient\ncan still be so young …”\n“Honor,” Dalinar guessed. “That’s the power of Honor. It’s started to\ndevelop its own mind.”\n“Yes,” Nohadon said, looking on it fondly.\nWho could stop the war?"

It’s started to\ndevelop its own mind.”\n“Yes,” Nohadon said, looking on it fondly.\nWho could stop the war?\n“The powers,” Dalinar whispered. “The war will stop when the powers\nthemselves want it to stop.”\nNohadon snapped his fingers.\nDalinar walked over to the child, then settled down next to them. “Hey,”\nhe said.\n“I chose you,” they whispered, “because you’d seen my life, and\nunderstood what I’d been through. But then you refused to fight. You\nrefused.” The child stared at the wall, at nothing. “Even he knows it’s the\nright thing, to fight until one of us wins. Why does he know better than you\ndo? He’s our enemy?”\nDalinar took a bite of bread. “You saw my life, parts of it, as you made\nthe visions for me.”\n“Yes.”\n“You remember the one with the barrels of oil?”\n“That one played out wrong,” Honor’s power whispered. “You were\nsupposed to burn the room, and all in it. Why do you do what is wrong?\nThere was another you there, who understood.”\nStorms. This bread really was good.\n“Understanding. You wanted someone to understand you. That’s why\nyou came to me.”\nThe child nodded.\n“What about my wife, Evi?” Dalinar asked. “Can you try to understand\nher?”\n“She broke an oath. She went to the enemy. You were there to stop them,\nand she went to them anyway.”\n“Can you understand, though?” Dalinar said. “Why she did? Why it was,\nto her—and to me now—the right thing? Why she’s the example, and I the\nfailure?”\n“I … I can’t.”\n“Can you try? You want to be understood. Do you not think others want\nto be understood too, by you?”\nThe being scrunched up its brow. And thought.\nGood enough for now. Dalinar finished his bread, then stood and walked\nback to Nohadon, by the wall.\n“It is a child,” Dalinar said. “Or like one. Newly born, with its own\nvolition.” He met Nohadon’s eyes. “It reasons like one now, with a simple\nperspective. But it’s willing to consider things. It can change, can’t it?\nGrow?”\n“What do you think?” Nohadon said, snacking on bread.\n“Yes. The powers must be able to change. Everyone can change, even\nme. I walked those paths … I saw the past … I know divinity. Honor must\nlearn. That’s the answer.”\n“Midius is right. You really aren’t as dense as everyone says.”\n“You realize people have spent literal centuries writing about how wise,\nand serene, and full of decorum you must have been.”\n“I’m a king,” Nohadon said. “Therefore, whatever I do is by definition\nregal. You have the answer?”\n“Almost …” Dalinar said. “The power needs time to learn, and ways to\nexperience the lessons to change, but I can’t give them either. Because time\nis what Taravangian wants. So he can plot. I can’t let him do that, so I need"

I can’t let him do that, so I need\nto simultaneously buy time for Honor’s power, but deny it to Taravangian.”\nThe answer was so close. Today, Dalinar had seen true honor. As Adolin\nstood for Azir, and Renarin set right a terrible wrong. As Jasnah picked\nherself up from failure, and Shallan rose above what had been done to her.\nAnd Kaladin …\nBlood of my fathers, Dalinar thought, realizing. Kaladin will preserve a\npiece … That’s what we need …\nNow that he knew the end he wanted, Dalinar could see the answers. You\nnever could find them unless you knew what you were looking for, could\nyou?\n“I can’t stop Odium,” Dalinar whispered, a plan forming. “But they can.”\nHe looked to Nohadon. “Am I simply doing the same thing that has always\nbeen done, though? Kicking the problem down to the next generation. Isn’t\nthat an awful idea?”\n“That depends,” Nohadon said, “upon what aid you can give them. And\nupon the type of people they are.”\n“They are the best,” Dalinar whispered. “There will be a cost, won’t\nthere? I need Taravangian to think he’s won. And storms, he’s at least a little\nbit right, isn’t he? About decisions?”\n“Right,” Nohadon said, “and terribly, terribly wrong.” He squeezed\nDalinar’s arm. “We do have to make awful decisions sometimes. They will\nbe flawed because we are flawed. That is not a reason, however, to give up\non finding better solutions. And the destination …”\n“… must not undermine the journey.” Dalinar nodded. “I’ll pay the cost.\nSend me back.”\nNohadon smiled. “Good luck, my friend. Thank you for listening to me\nall those years. It does a man good to know that what he wrote has meant\nsomething …”\nThe vision collapsed. In the blink of an eye, Dalinar was back on that\nrooftop—and was again a god, his power pressing against that of\nTaravangian.\nYes, he could defeat Taravangian, but that wasn’t winning. “I cannot best\nyou,” Dalinar whispered with a voice of thunder. “No matter what I do.”\n“You are correct,” Taravangian said, and Dalinar sensed relief in his\nvoice. At least part of him had known that fighting Honor, with the will of\nthe Blackthorn, was a dangerous proposition for him. “Whether you are god\nor man, it is the same: serve me or kill an innocent. You will learn the\nlesson.”\n“I have learned it,” Dalinar said. “Just not the way you intended me to.”\nDalinar felt the Stormfather there, and he remarkably came to the same\nconclusion. The path of the Heralds from long ago. A path Dalinar had\nspent a lifetime trying to understand.\nYes, the remnant of Tanavast said. I am willing. This is my ultimate\nchoice and sacrifice, Dalinar. I choose. Do it now.\nDalinar opened his eyes, beacons of blazing power, and spoke four\nfateful words."

As he killed his sister,\ngiving her the final death, the whispers became less accusatory. Indeed, they\ngrew welcoming.\nJoin us.\nThe Truthwatcher, seeing that her ploy hadn’t worked, howled and came\nfor Szeth—and Szeth cut her down, with mercy. Then it was only him and\nhis father.\nSzeth strode forward, his arm a writhing mass of agony, Nightblood\nscreaming for blood in his ears—accompanied by a chorus of shadows.\nJoin us!\nHe met his father, who still wept, and they clashed—though after a few\nquick meetings of black sword against Blade, Szeth knew Neturo was no\nmatch for him. Even though he’d trained, Neturo was more bureaucrat than\nwarrior.\nSzeth pushed Neturo—blade against Blade—back until he hit a stone\nrock formation. Szeth held him there, eye to eye.\n“How long?” Szeth whispered. “How long did you know?”\n“Si … Sivi told me, when she wasn’t supposed to, that they had a new\nGod. Our first year at Pozen’s monastery. I started training with the Blades\nto become Bondsmith then.”\nA real answer. Neturo spoke with gritted teeth, forcing the sentences\nthrough, but it did seem to be him. His father’s voice.\nIt was enough that Szeth almost wavered. “Why didn’t you tell me,\nFather? You had answers. That’s all I was seeking.”\n“Szeth …” Neturo said. “I was following you because I thought you had\nanswers. The young man always so certain what was right. The youth who\nbested all who came against him. The man who was so direct, so certain.\nWhen I found the Honorbearers believing something impossible … I\nthought you’d find the truth, Szeth.”\n“So you served the thing?” Szeth demanded. “You took up the Blade,\nyou became an Honorbearer, you banished me?”\n“Every step felt so natural …” Neturo said. “Until … it had me, Szeth. It\nhad me.” Tears leaked down his face.\nAn emotion was made complete in Szeth; a circle that had begun the day\nwhen they’d first found that rock, and his father had refused to decide what\nto do. Parents were just people. His had loved him; Szeth knew that. He\nloved them in turn. Enough to do what came next.\nSzeth let himself be shoved back by Neturo, then ducked the following\nsweep and stabbed Nightblood through the chest of his father.\n“Thank you.” With a sigh of relief, Neturo-son-Vallano vanished into\ndark mist.

It\nreached for Szeth’s soul. An ending? It would be so easy to let Nightblood\ntake him.\nHe glanced to the side, and saw Ishar sitting up near Kaladin, restored.\nThere was a lightness to the air and to the sky. So blue. Szeth had returned\nto Shinovar with Truth. Exiled, now restored.\nThe land was whole again.\nTime to die, Szeth thought. It is what I decide. I can decide for myself. I\n…\nYet …\nIf he did that, it would betray everything Kaladin had taught him. Yes,\nSzeth could choose.\nAnd he needed to choose better.\n“I’m sorry, Father,” Szeth said, sobbing. “I cannot go with you. Not …\nnot this time.”\nLive, then, the shadows whispered. Live and do better.\nWith teeth gritted against the pain, he started toward the sheath—but\nKaladin’s Stormlight was finally out, and the pain brought Szeth to his\nknees again. Unable to walk, he forcibly pried his fingers off Nightblood.\nOne at a time.\nThe sword kept drinking.\nWith a howl, Szeth cast the weapon away. It spun like a dancer, point\nagainst the ground, still twisting—like a top released from its string. It\nstayed upright, spraying darkness around it and screaming in a voice that\nlacked any of the affable friendliness Szeth had known in it.\nDESTROY. EVIL!\nKaladin watched from where he had fallen to the pain. Szeth began to\ndisintegrate to dark smoke, his hand evaporating, then his arm. Kaladin\nstretched out his hand, trailing its own dark smoke, toward his friend. The\nwind blew around him as if frantic, and Syl was screaming in pain.\n“Stop it, Ishar!” Nale’s voice, distant.\n“I cannot. I … I cannot, Nale! The sword will consume me if I touch it!\nThere is no Stormlight. It has taken it all …”\nKaladin needed to replace its sheath, but he couldn’t speak, couldn’t\neven … think …\nSzeth … Szeth’s arm was gone … He was dying.\nThen, a quiet voice.\nI … I am not a thing.\n“Rule one,” Kaladin whispered, searching for the voice. Landing on the\nspinning sword.\nI … I can choose.\nEvidently someone other than Szeth had listened to the lessons Kaladin\nhad been teaching.\n“You are not a thing, Nightblood,” Kaladin said.\nI AM NOT A THING!\nThe pain vanished. Nightblood spun to a stop, lazily, the smoke fading\naway. The black sword balanced on its point for a second, then clattered to\nthe stones.\nA dozing voice seemed to whisper, I … will not … kill my friends.\nKaladin heaved a sigh, worn out completely, and rested his head against\nthe stone ground.

She felt like paint on a palette after a vigorous\nmixing to blend colors. “Damnation. What happened?”\n“Ba-Ado-Mishram,” Pattern said, sitting up in a motion that was\ndistinctly inhuman. Not stretching, or getting into position, or leveraging\nhimself with his arms. He just sat up like a bent hinge. “She escaped back\ninto the Cognitive Realm where she is most comfortable, and carried us\nwith her. Mmm … that’s probably good, right?”\nShallan sat and spotted Renarin and Rlain nearby on the same platform,\nhelping one another stand. Then she made the mistake of looking up.\nTwo violent storms clashed against one another. Iridescent mother-of-\npearl against red-gold. In Shadesmar, they manifested like two clouds of ink\nin water, each trying to overtake the other.\n“Dalinar and Odium?” she asked.\n“Yup!” Pattern said. “I think we might be in danger here.

A figure of black smoke with white\neyes. Not Mishram, but an Unmade who was smaller, and looked more\nhuman than singer.\nTogether, Shallan, Pattern, and Testament helped the two wounded spren\nover to Sja-anat. She became more real, blackness trailing from her, and her\neyes pits of white nothing.\n“I will remember your care for my children,” she said.\n“Eventually,” Shallan said, “you will need to pick a side, Sja-anat. What\nyou did here … pitting Mraize and me against one another …”\n“I did not create your disagreements,” she said. “I only made certain that\nwhichever of you freed my sister, I would have had a hand in it.

Now.”\nShallan glanced toward the platform, which she’d left to meet Sja-anat.\nThe two enormous spren of the Oathgate had crouched down, a posture\nshe’d never seen from them before.\nShallan dashed toward the platform, where Rlain and Renarin waited.\nJust before she reached it, however, one of the Oathgate spren screamed.\nThough Renarin was holding out his hand toward Shallan, light surrounded\nhim and Rlain, and they vanished."

Uniting is not an\nultimate good. It is only as good as the purposes for that unification.\n“I have been bested by you. Continuing in this contract merely because I\nagreed to it … that would be the ultimate act of foolishness. You have won\nbecause you are smarter than I am. But you have not proven anything other\nthan that.”\nTaravangian roared in defiance, then … then in glory as he realized this\nwould mean his freedom. The contract, including Honor’s binding of\nOdium to this world, was finished. In a rage, he attacked …\nAnd vaporized the Stormfather.\nDalinar bellowed in agony. He had expected to go first, and this was\ncruel—unnecessarily so. Still, Dalinar was met with one last confident gaze\nof the being’s eyes—and a knowledge that what remained of Tanavast felt\nredemption in this choice.\nThen he was gone. Dalinar fell to his knees. He blinked through the pain,\ndetermined. Now the gambit, the way to buy time. Dalinar raised an arm\nagainst the wind, feeling so very, very small now that the power had left\nhim. He was … like a ragged old uniform, once stretched across a powerful\nfigure, now tattered remnants.\nHonor’s power hovered there, glowing like its own third storm. It\nwanted a host so badly. It had waited millennia, and now it had been\nbetrayed a second time.

He felt, in fact, all of his Connections.\nTo Navani, he sent love.\nTo Adolin, he sent apologies.\nTo Renarin, he sent pride.\nTo the others, he sent courage.\nI could not defeat Odium, he told them. But I can buy you time. For\nOdium is about to have his attention entirely consumed by a greater\nproblem.\nThis was Dalinar’s final test: at long last, trusting someone else to do the\njob.\nWith a smile, he felt echoes through the cosmere. Each time Honor had\ngone to the other gods for help, they’d been content to leave Roshar alone.\nTo make Odium someone else’s problem.\nDalinar could see the difference between giving up responsibility—as\nthey had—and ensuring someone else had the chance you could not. As of\nnow, the other gods’ attention fixated on Taravangian. Each of those vast\nbeings witnessed the birth of the most powerful and dangerous thing that\nhad existed since the Shattering of Adonalsium.\nThose forces together acknowledged that they had an enemy. Freed from\nhis constraints, supremely strong.

Dalinar closed his\neyes, ready to die right there, in that furious storm, strong enough to flay his\nskin from his body. However, somehow within the tempest, Dalinar heard\nsomething: the sound of a man whimpering in pain.\nSo, Dalinar Kholin heaved himself up against the wind—his body\nbreaking, and blood streaming from him—to fight it one last time.\nAnd now we reach the part of the narrative where I can but\nspeculate, as my witnesses were both unconscious.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 271\nNale felt good.\nNot great. Not wonderful. But he felt … better. A shadow had lifted from\nhim.\nNow though, something terrible had happened again. Suddenly his\nstomach churned, and a force seemed to try to turn him inside out.\n“Ishar?” he said, kneeling beside the other Herald, who stared at the sky,\nhis eyes wide. “Ishar, what is it?”\n“The Stormfather is dead,” Ishar whispered. “Dalinar Kholin has failed.\nHonor is being consumed … Retribution … his name is Retribution.” He\nblinked, concentrating. “Cultivation flees. Retribution will also consume\nand destroy the spren, then remake them to his will and pleasure.”\n“What?” Nale said, helping the aged Herald sit. “All of them? Ishar …\nwhat do we do?”\n“I don’t know …” Ishar said. “I see clearly for the first time in centuries\n… It’s been so long, walking through fog. Or smoke, the smoke of a\nburning world …” He focused again on Nale. “Like the spren, we bear a\ndistinctive part of Honor’s power in us. Retribution will want to reclaim it.\nPrepare yourself, Nale. This is our end.”\nThe end. Nale fell to his knees, then settled back. The end. Yes. He could\naccept the end. Even if he’d just started feeling hope for recovery …\nPerhaps it was time.\nPerhaps it was past time.\n“What will this mean?” he asked. “For Roshar?”\n“No Stormlight,” Ishar said, tired. “No highstorm. The enemy has won,\nand I was too infatuated with my own plots to notice or stop it …” He\nwiped his mouth with a trembling hand. “This is what we deserve.”\nPerhaps, a familiar voice said—trembling, uncertain. But there is still a\nservice you could perform. If you are willing.\n“What service?” Nale asked the Wind.\nA ring of ten, in their strength, could bind Retribution in some small way.\nCould it not?\n“… Yes,” Ishar said. “We bear Honor’s power. Much as our Connection\nto Odium helped us bind him and his spren long ago, our Connection to\nHonor could let us bind Retribution. In a small way.” The elderly Herald\nwiped blood from his mouth. “We could maybe prevent him from taking the\nspren to himself. We could seal away that part of his power, weaken him.\nYes … Yes, that could work.”"

Reaffirm our oaths, exploit that weakness he made in\nhimself for us.”\nNale trembled. Reforge the Oathpact? “Ishar,” he said, feeling a deep,\nshameful terror rise inside of him.\nMemories.\nAgony.\nBeing held against stones, his soul burned and flayed.\nHearing his friends scream in pain, their voices echoing in his ears for\ncenturies, awful and terrible, like the sound of fingernails being ripped from\nthe flesh.\nNale blinked sudden tears from the corners of his eyes. “I can’t go back,\nIshar. I … I can’t. I’m not strong enough!”\nWhat if … there were a way to improve the Oathpact? the Wind asked.\nNale could sense the fear in her voice … in the many voices of the\nwindspren gathered to watch. What if there were a way for your minds to go\nsomewhere else?\n“Hmm …” Ishar said, as the Wind perhaps showed him something Nale\ncouldn’t see. “You’ve been thinking about this a long time, haven’t you …”\nI have had a great deal of time to think, Ishar.\n“It could work. Nale, help me up.”\nNale did so, lifting Ishar, who suddenly seemed frail in a way no Herald\never should. They looked upon a sorry scene. Swords scattered across the\nground. Stormblessed, collapsed, his hand smoldering, several fingers\nmissing. Szeth in worse shape, his arm gone all the way to the shoulder, his\nclothing burned away on one side, the skin beneath scored and blackened.\nSylphrena was lying on her back—she appeared whole, yet was sobbing.\nA black sword. Full of Investiture, mumbling to itself in a daze. Ishar\nlimped to his own sword, which he’d dropped in the chaos. He hesitated\nbefore touching it.\n“Perhaps you should place them,” he said to Nale. “I … don’t feel like\nmyself when I touch its power.”\nNale did as asked, taking each Honorblade and placing it in the circle\nuntil all nine stood in their slots. All but Jezrien’s.\n“The Wind has suggested a way to avoid the torture, Nale,” Ishar said.\n“Impossible while Honor lived, but with some of his power siphoned off as\nRetribution asserts himself …”\nNale spun. “How?”\n“I have studied the Stormfather’s visions,” Ishar explained. “The Wind\nhas suggested that I create something similar. Though our souls will return\nto Braize, our minds are separate—and I can place them inside a vision,\nfreed from whatever our souls or bodies might feel. With delicacy, this can\nbe hidden from the Shards. I think I can do it, if Ash and Pralla help.”"

I think I can do it, if Ash and Pralla help.”\nNale rushed back to Ishar, taking him by the arm. “You mean …?”\n“We could perhaps have peace between Returns,” Ishar said. “Instead of\ntorture. Retribution will certainly seek vengeance against us if we bind him,\nand will attempt to make us break the pact, but if he cannot find our minds\n…”\nSomething deep within Nale trembled at that idea. Peace. He had not\nknown it for so long.\n“Will it work?” Nale asked. “Truly work?”\n“I cannot guarantee it,” Ishar said, “but I think it will. Old friend. Can\nyou summon the courage to try?”\nOld friend. They had not begun as friends. He had considered Ishar\nhaughty. Perhaps he had been. Perhaps some of that remained. But friends,\nnow. Yes, that was right.\nBut what of Nale’s courage? He opened his mouth, but thought he heard\n…\nHe thought he heard the sound of flutes.\n“I will try,” Nale whispered.\n“Good, good,” Ishar said. “Come. It will be the end of all spren if we do\nnot do something. Honor must be preserved.” Ishar knelt by Szeth. Nale\njoined him, prodding delicately at the man’s wounds. They weren’t quite\nlike burns; more like necrosis.\n“Szeth lives,” Nale said, “but he needs Regrowth. I have a fabrial—”\n“But no Stormlight,” Ishar said.\n“No Stormlight.” Nale deflated. During the confrontation, either Ishar,\nthe sword, or Stormblessed had consumed it.\n“Once Szeth is a Herald, this body will be meaningless anyway,” Ishar\nsaid. “We proceed.”\nNale turned Szeth onto his back. His head rolled, limp. He breathed,\nbarely. “Can he do it? He must speak the Words.”\nNo, the Wind said. He cannot.\nA sound rumbled in the east. Nale looked, and saw darkness growing in\nthe sky. Like a bruise on the heavens themselves. “You said no more\nstorms, Ishar!”\n“I said no more highstorm,” Ishar whispered. “But there is another\nstorm. Now the only storm. The Night of Sorrows has come, Nale. The True\nDesolation is here.”\n“The True Desolation?” Nale said, cradling Szeth in his lap. “Ishar, what\n… what good is it to fight now? Why struggle? Why care? The Stormfather\nis gone. Jezrien is gone. We have lost, finally. Honor is dead.”\n“Yes,” a quiet voice said. “Honor is dead.”\nBoth Heralds spun to see Kaladin Stormblessed slowly pushing himself\nup to a seated position, hair disheveled, blue uniform rumpled, dirt on his\nface. He looked at his right hand, what was left of it, and grimaced.

And I’m not sure if I\never really knew him …”\nShe glanced at him, and as she did, he saw a storm in her eyes. Not a\nmetaphoric one, but actual lightning and swirling clouds, filling them. In a\nmoment, she wore something very different. A regal gown, fit for … for a\nqueen.\n“I can’t protect the spren, Kaladin,” she said. “Odium holds Honor’s\npower. We are now part of … of him. He will take us to him, destroy us,\nUnmake us.”\n“I think,” Kaladin said, “the Wind has prepared a solution for that.\nHaven’t you?”\nI’m sorry. I should not ask … but I do. This is the only solution I could\nthink of to prevent the danger that I sensed.\nSyl sat up, and hesitated. “The last remnants of Honor lie here, in the\nhands of a broken circle of broken men and women. I see. Damnation,\nKaladin. I see.”\n“An Oathpact could stop what is coming?” Kaladin asked.\nThe original one worked because most of the Heralds had once been\nchosen by Odium, and could leverage that Connection to bind him, the\nWind said, blowing across him. An oath here, now that he’s Retribution,\nshould do the same. Maybe. Please. Don’t hate me.\nKaladin gritted his teeth and stood, forming fists—or trying, since one of\nhis hands didn’t work anymore, and he felt only numbness from it.\nHe faced into the Wind. “Will the spren really die if this is not done?”\nYes, the Wind whispered. Dalinar Kholin is dead. Cultivation has been\nfreed from the planet, and runs, fearful of what she has done. Honor and\nOdium combine. Retribution will absorb all of the power, and will create\nweapons from it. New Unmade. Terrible Unmade.\nKaladin took a deep breath. “What do you need me to do?”\nSyl took his arm, and when he looked to her, he saw tears on her cheeks.\nActual tears. How?\n“Are you sure, Kaladin?” Syl whispered. “You know what it will mean?\nFor you to …”\nStorms. Was she saying …?\nYes. He had known it the moment he stood up.\n“We cannot ask this of you,” Syl whispered.\nKaladin steeled himself. “But I can offer.”\n“You spent all this time learning that you can’t sacrifice yourself for\neveryone else,” she said. “You can’t do this.”\n“Pardon,” he said gently, placing his hand on hers, “but that is not what I\nlearned, Syl.”\nShe looked up at him.\n“I learned that I don’t have to make that sacrifice,” he explained. “I can’t\nprotect everyone, and I have made peace with that.

I\ncan repay that now.” He faced the Wind again. “Dalinar is really dead?”\nYes. And I cannot feel Navani or the Sibling.\nSyl shivered, tears rolling farther down her cheeks. Had he ever seen her\ncry before?\nKaladin closed his eyes. “The people will have nothing left. No storm,\nno god, no king … They must be given some kind of hope.” He opened his\neyes and met Syl’s. “What do you need me to do.”\n“You will need to say the Words,” she whispered.\n“Stormblessed?” Nale asked.\nKaladin turned to see Nale gingerly lowering Szeth, unconscious, to the\nground. “You don’t know what you’re saying,” Nale said. “Ishar’s plan to\nprotect our minds might not work. We could be going to torture. Even if not\n… it could be centuries until we return. Everyone you know and love will\nbe dead by then.”\nKaladin’s heart trembled. Bridge Four … his family …\n“It should be him,” Nale said, nodding to Szeth. “He has no Connections\nleft. He has been prepared for this.”\nKaladin crossed the patch of too-springy ground. He knelt and rested his\nfingers on Szeth’s wounded shoulder. “No. He cannot bear this.”\n“But—” Nale began.\n“He chose peace,” Kaladin said, “not war. Heralds must fight, and he\nneeds to heal.” He felt the wind blowing across him. “I cannot protect\neveryone. But I can protect him.”\nIshar, kneeling nearby, looked up at Kaladin. “Child? You really think\nyou can replace Jezrien, our king?”\nKaladin rose and carefully slid Nightblood’s sheath back onto him. The\nsword didn’t seem to be awake; instead it was in a stupor. From there,\nKaladin walked to his pack and dug inside, finding something soft at the\nbottom.\n“Jezrien was the greatest of men,” Ishar said. “Our guide and our leader.\nI prepared Szeth for over a decade. You cannot take the place of a king like\nJezrien.”\n“To think,” Kaladin said softly, “that you have lived millennia and you\nhaven’t learned a simple truth.” He pulled a deep blue cloak from the pack,\nthe tower and the crown emblazoned on the back. “Nobility has nothing to\ndo with blood, Ishar. But it has everything to do with heart.”\nKaladin stood up and threw the cloak over his shoulders. It swept\nthrough the air, and he felt the Wind making it float around him.\nThe spren were there when you needed us, the Wind said to him. Please.\nThey are so afraid.\n“It’s all right,” he said. He took a deep breath, and started toward the\nring of swords. “I’m here.”\nSyl fell into step next to him. “No one can tell you the Words.”"

He took a deep breath, and started toward the\nring of swords. “I’m here.”\nSyl fell into step next to him. “No one can tell you the Words.”\n“Fortunately, I know them.”\nWind blew around him, and he … he remembered that wind. He\nremembered it blowing as he first picked up a spear, long ago, and before\nthat when he was a child first holding a quarterstaff. Kaladin stepped\nthrough a version of himself, that youthful version everyone had called Kal.\nFor he was part of Kaladin.\nThe wind had been there on the day he’d killed Helaran and saved\nAmaram. The last day Squadleader Kaladin had existed. Kaladin walked\nthrough that old version of himself. For he was part of Kaladin.\nHe remembered the wind blowing in his face, trying to force him back\nfrom the Honor Chasm. He remembered thinking about how it had worked\nto keep him from taking those steps. That version of Kaladin appeared, the\nwretch, the slave. Kaladin strode through him, for he was part of Kaladin.\nThe wind had been there with him when he’d fought Szeth in the clouds.\nKaladin Stormblessed, Radiant. Kaladin strode through that man, for that\nman was part of him.\nThe wind had been there when he’d fought the Pursuer after Teft’s death\n—that day when Kaladin had almost given in to Odium. That version of\nKaladin appeared, his eyes burning yellow-red. Kaladin strode through that\nfigure, for it was yet another element of him, and he should not forget.\nThe Wind had always been there. Holding its breath at some important\nmoments, but blowing alongside him gloriously during others. If he did not\nact, Retribution would kill it, and Syl, and all of them. Kaladin had to hide\nthe Wind, the Heralds, and the last bits of Honor away. Protect them.\nUntil the time was right to Return.\nYes, he knew the Words. Not an Ideal of any set of Radiants. Something\nmore daunting. A last version of Kaladin appeared in front of him, a\nterrifying, glorious being.\nKaladin. Herald.\n“I,” Kaladin whispered, walking through that version, “accept this\njourney.”\nThe air split with a crack of thunder. When the reply came, it was Syl’s\nvoice. These Words are accepted.\n“That isn’t what we said,” Nale said.\n“The important part is not the Words themselves,” Kaladin said. “It is,\nagain, the heart. Thousands of years, and I’d think you would know this.”\nKaladin thrust out his broken hand—withered, with only the thumb and\ntwo fingers remaining—as he reached the ring of weapons. Syl, in turn,\nthrust her hand forward, near his and right below it. A white-blue spear of\nlight formed in their hands—both Kaladin and Syl gripping it.\nTogether, they rammed it into the ground in the open spot of the ring.\nThe light faded, creating a tall, silvery spear—not the one he’d been using,\nthough it had echoes of the design. This hadn’t been made from Syl; this\nhad been created, like the Honorblades, from Honor."

As he determined to do so, Honor swelled\ninside him, and more fully bonded into Retribution.\nGood. Likewise, he would allow the Shattered Plains to have a kind of\nautonomy themselves. What of the rest? Roshar was entirely dominated.\nHis agents in the Shin government had succeeded while the Heralds were\ndistracted. The Reshi Isles … he had the land, all of it, though those who\nrode the beasts had largely rejected his offers. They weren’t worth the\neffort.\nEverything else on Roshar—ninety percent of the planet—had accepted\nhis deals or had been won by his forces. That would do. It was enough. In\nfact, it was glorious. Retribution would keep his promises. Oaths were\nimportant. And Retribution would destroy anyone who believed differently.\nStrangely, the power of Honor displayed the slightest hint of …\nuncertainty. What was that? Why was it acting so oddly? Taravangian’s\nexpanded knowledge found this impossible; was it because some of it had\nbeen siphoned off, locked away?\nI will need to move quickly, he thought, seeing possible futures. Escape\nRoshar, before the other Shards move against me. They are timid still, but\nwill be galvanized by time.\nHis next actions would have to be decisive. He began thinking of ways\nto draw the attention of his enemies toward a conflict on Scadrial … He\nwould have to leave Roshar under a regent, as he needed to plan how to\nevade this trap that Dalinar had created for him. How? How had the man\nbeen so clever? How had Taravangian not seen this?\nHis anger at Dalinar surged again, a tempest of flame and ire. Dalinar.\nDalinar had stolen centuries from him! No more planning, no more careful\nmanipulations. Dalinar …\nDalinar did still exist.\nTaravangian reached out and found something lingering on the other\nside: Dalinar’s soul. Infused with power, unable to pass on yet. The part of a\nperson that remained, briefly, before entering the Beyond. Taravangian\nseized it, and it fell into his power.\nFor Dalinar Kholin was an oathbreaker.\nY I I , Taravangian said to him. I\nOU REALIZE CAN NOW DO WITH YOU WHAT WILL\n, D .

D , NOTHING.\nOTHING ANYMORE ALINAR YOU ARE\nIf so, then I trade it for everything. Taravangian … I call that a bargain.\nTaravangian raged, furious that Dalinar refused to let him gloat. Yet he\nwould not be goaded; he would control this power. Taravangian still had\nuses for Dalinar. His broken oaths put his soul in Taravangian’s hands, and\nhe would make an Unmade from him. Make him …\nDalinar’s soul slipped away from him. Stretched. And vanished into the\nBeyond. Taravangian scrambled to hold it, but like water through fingers,\nhe could not.\nYou cannot have him, the powers said, for he is claimed by another.\nDefeat.\nWhy should Taravangian feel defeated when he’d won everything? He\nraged again, this time worst of all, ripples of it further warping the realms\naround Roshar. Dalinar had escaped? Dalinar was dead?\nBut no. There was something of him left. Taravangian found it in the\nSpiritual Realm. It had manifested in the vision where Dalinar had\nstubbornly thrown an oil barrel and performed acts of peace, as if he hadn’t\nalready burned a city to the ground.\nIn that vision, the Blackthorn had formed. And the Blackthorn … it was\na legend. It was spoken of, molded by the minds of people, taking shape. It\nhad responded differently from every other part of the visions, for things\npeople thought about came alive.\nA great number of people thought about the Blackthorn. The stories of\nhim outgrew Dalinar himself—who had made at least one mistake. He’d\ngiven this thing his memories, shown it the future, and now it came even\nmore fully to life.\nRetribution cradled it.\nYou are right, it said to him, making his ego soothe and anger soften. He\nwas weak. I am not weak. I will not do the things he showed me. I will not\nweep, drunken, when an assassin must be fought. I will not back down from\nthe fight and the conquest. I am the Blackthorn.\nWill you serve me? Retribution asked. When I take war to the stars.\nIt is what I do, said the Blackthorn.\nYes … a mistake. Dalinar had Connected to this nascent spren of\nhimself, given it his memories, his skill—memories that, in it, came too\nsoon. It was what Dalinar could have been, had Cultivation not protected\nhim from his actions. Greater than Gavilar, greater than any man.\nA true champion. With incredible battle acumen, brilliant understanding\nof tactics and strategy, and Dalinar’s stubborn force of will. But without the\nweak inhibitions of his old age, such as having been broken by his wife’s\ndeath.\nYes. Dalinar Kholin had died.\nBut the Blackthorn would live.\nNow, to deal with one other oathbreaker. The Heralds, he saw, were safe\nfrom his touch. But one person was not, a person both powers warned him\nto deal with immediately.\nWhere was Wit?"

It requires an oath forged, and a bit of a god …”\nKaladin’s eyes went wide as something burned within him. He could feel\nthe others. Taln, Ash, Vedel, Chana … they felt terrified, worried they were\nheading toward torture.\nThis is working, the Wind whispered. Kaladin, it’s working! The\nOathpact preserves the spren!\n“I hope we will be beyond him too,” Ishar said, seizing his Blade. He\nlooked to Kaladin. “But … even so … I might lose myself again. Not all of\nthe rot upon my soul was because of the power of Odium, Stormblessed. I\n… am weak. Of mind.”\n“I will help,” Kaladin promised.\nNearby, Nale stiffened, then evaporated, vanishing into nothingness. His\nsword disappeared from the ring.\n“We use bodies of power when we Return, child,” Ishar said. “No one\ndies to create us. Honor found such an idea as the Fused abhorrent. Once.”\nKaladin nodded, steeling himself as his soul began to vibrate. A light\nenveloped him, and as it did, Syl found his hand. And he could feel her grip\nit.\n“You still have your original body,” Ishar said as he vanished. “Your soul\nwill be pulled with us, leaving the body behind. I’m sorry. It might hurt.”\nKaladin squeezed Syl’s hand tightly, then gasped, a terrible fire ripping\nthrough him. A flaring in his skull, agonizing. He felt his eyes burn away, as\nif he’d been struck by a Shardblade.\nFollowed by …\nNothing.\nBut it was not a complete success, as I have not heard the Wind—\nneither has Szeth—in years.

Though his\nplan had worked, and the generals had commended him on salvaging a\nterrible situation, he didn’t feel it. He felt awful.\n“You’re talking to the wrong surgeon, I’m afraid,” Lirin said, walking to\nhis cupboard. “My son is training to help with mental and emotional\nailments. His strategies for dealing with loss will help more than my\nmedicines. That said, you might have trouble sleeping, and for that I can\noffer—”\nThe door slammed open.\nWit stood on the other side, wide-eyed, puffing, sweat trickling down his\nface.\n“Excuse me?” Lirin said. “This surgery room is off-limits to even you. I\nneed to maintain—”\n“Dalinar is dead,” Wit snapped. “The Sibling is going into another self-\nprotective coma. The world is ending. So if you please, Lirin, shut up.”\nWhat? Dalinar had lost? Sigzil, in his haze of pain, hadn’t been paying\nattention to much—he was barely aware that a day had passed since losing\nVienta.\nWit shoved Lirin out the door and slammed it. He dashed up to Sigzil\nand took him by both arms. “Kid, I need you. I really, really need your\nhelp.”\n“Wha … what?” Sigzil asked. “Why are—”\n“Listen to me,” Wit hissed. “In a frighteningly short amount of time, the\npower that Odium holds is going to identify me as the only thing on the\nplanet that can harm him. The power bears a grudge, even though its vessel\nhas changed. It’s going to vaporize me.”\n“Wit?” Sigzil said. “I thought nothing could—”\n“Pay attention,” Wit said, shaking him. “I’m holding something\nincredibly dangerous. Something that Odium absolutely cannot get access\nto. A power more ancient than any of the gods. Do you understand me? I\nneed someone to take it. I need someone to bear it for a short time, until I\ncan return for it. It can’t be a Radiant. It would be too dangerous, too much\npower in one person’s hands.”\n“But … you’re a Radiant …”\n“Smart as always.” Wit pointed one hand at him. “Sigzil,” he said, his\nvoice growing solemn. “Old Dalinar has done something incredibly stupid.\nHe made a gamble, and in so doing he unleashed a terror upon the entire\ncosmere. I don’t have time to explain all the ramifications, but we cannot\nlet Odium have the Dawnshard. He is the last being in all the many worlds\nwho should hold it.”\n“And …” Sigzil said, his mind racing, the pain fading before this\ninformation. “And so you brought it here to his planet?”\nWit took a deep breath, then nodded.\n“Idiot,” Sigzil said.\n“Guilty. Will you do it, Sigzil? Will you take it?”\nSomething came alight within him. A way to make up for his failings.\n“Yes, I’ll take it, Wit. I’ll do better this time. I’ll redeem myself.”"

As much as its ilk can like anything.\nI don’t think it’s alive, not like a spren, or the power of the Shards. More …\nit likes you the way a subaxial electron likes a nucleus. Are you ready?”\nSigzil nodded.\n“When Odium arrives,” Wit said, “his presence coalescing here will let\nme do something odd.” He held up a device made of several gears and what\nappeared to be glowing light—not trapped in a gemstone, but in an\nhourglass. “I’m sorry for how that will feel, but the Dawnshard should keep\nyou alive. Get off this planet as soon as you can. Keep it away from him,\nSig. Our only advantage is that he doesn’t know it’s here. Unfortunately, if\nhe kills me while I hold it, he’ll discover the truth.

The\nentire room in front of him had filled with some kind of crystal, and his\naunt Navani floated in the center of it, glowing. Frozen, eyes closed.\nShe appeared to be asleep. Although the tower continued to function as it\nhad since awakening—lifts, pumps, lights all working properly, Towerlight\navailable to Radiants here—they could not communicate with the Sibling or\nNavani. Jasnah knelt in front of Renarin, her hands against the glassy wall.\nHe put his next to hers on the wall, and could hear his aunt’s heartbeat.\n“Have you ever heard of anything like this?” Renarin asked Rlain and\nJasnah.\n“No,” Jasnah said. She looked exhausted. Deep bags beneath her eyes,\nmakeup a mess, normally immaculate hair out of its braids. “No. But she\nseems alive. She has to survive … I need her …”\nA dome of light as solid as this crystal surrounded the entirety of\nUrithiru, impassable. The Oathgates were inside that dome, but didn’t work.\nHe’d been transported here with Rlain during their last functional moments."

The Oathgates were inside that dome, but didn’t work.\nHe’d been transported here with Rlain during their last functional moments.\nHe’d left Shallan behind by accident. How could he explain that to\nAdolin? Last word was that his brother lived, but that was when there had\nbeen Stormlight and spanreeds. Now silence reigned. No storms. No\nspanreeds. No knowledge of what anyone anywhere was doing.\nThey were completely cut off.\nRlain put a hand on his shoulder, and Renarin placed his atop it, taking\nstrength from the singer’s presence. Finally, Jasnah stood. She nodded to\nthem, then led them back to a nearby room, where Sebarial and Aladar\nwaited. They looked to Renarin now that Navani was indisposed and\nRenarin’s father …\nRenarin’s father …\nHe took a deep breath, then walked with Jasnah and the highprinces to\nthe nearby stairwell. “I will not be your king,” Renarin whispered to them\nas they climbed those steps.\n“But—” Sebarial said.\n“Jasnah, I wish to adopt your system,” Renarin said. “Can we institute a\nrepresentative government for Urithiru, as you have for the Alethi exiles\nhere?”\n“I will show you how,” she said softly.\n“What?” Sebarial said. “But—”\n“My brother and I refuse the throne,” Renarin said. “I won’t stand for a\nhighprince to be elevated. We will have an elected senate and a Ministerial\nExemplar.” He stopped, looking back at them. “I think you’ll find\nBrightness Jasnah’s writings on the topic to be quite thorough.”\n“I’ve read them,” Sebarial said. “But if Queen Navani wakes, she’ll\ndiscover that most of her power has been stripped away! She’ll be furious.”\n“When my aunt wakes,” Renarin said, “she’ll accept that the world has\nprogressed, and a queen can lead without being a ruler. I think you’ll find\nher excited by the prospect.” He turned to the still-glowing lights in the\nwalls of Urithiru. “Besides, I expect she’ll have plenty to do.”\nHe continued up the steps, surprised by how confidently he spoke.\nOrdering around highprinces? Demanding they give up their power? But he\ncouldn’t be king; he and Rlain had other work to do. Odium now ruled the\nworld, and the singers had won—at long last—one of the Desolations.\nRlain intended to speak to their leaders on behalf of humankind. Renarin\nwould join him. Assuming they could ever get out of this city.\nRenarin emerged into the top room of the tower, and from there, took the\nsteps to the roof. Together, he, Rlain, and Jasnah joined a small, solemn\ngroup at the railing. Gavinor, somehow fully grown, sat by it with\nOathbringer across his lap, his eyes red.\nIt was so much to take in.

Now\n… now he needed to deal with what was ahead of him. A few others had\ncome to see the body, and they parted for Renarin.\nHe braced himself, took a deep breath, then knelt by the corpse of\nDalinar Kholin.\nMost of the damage to his body had been to his back, including the\nstrikes of windblown stones to his skull that had killed him. Now lying\nface-upward on the roof, he appeared peaceful. Eyes closed.\nRenarin closed his own eyes to the anguishspren floating around him and\ngave his father a final hug. Of the sort that Dalinar had always needed,\ndespite everyone else—everyone but Renarin—thinking otherwise. Being\nstrong didn’t mean that you didn’t need anyone. Those around you were the\nsource of your strength.\n“Thank you,” Renarin whispered to his father. “For being proud of me.\nFor showing me the heights we can reach, regardless of the depths we once\nknew.”\n“I hate that he died alone up here,” Aladar said, his voice rough,\nrepeating a sentiment he’d mentioned earlier. “That we couldn’t help him.”\n“He didn’t die alone, Aladar,” Renarin said, rising and turning toward the\nrest of them. “He … I …”\nHe looked to Jasnah. She nodded to him. So, as he’d told her, he took out\nhis notes, reading what he’d written quickly while Jasnah had tried to get\nthrough the crystal to Navani.\n“No hero dies alone,” Renarin read, written in halting words by his own\nhand, “for he carries with him the dreams of everyone who continues to\nlive. Those dreams will keep my father company in the Beyond, where he\ntaught us we go when we die. No continual war. No more killing. My father\nis finally at peace. And we live because of his sacrifice.”\nHe glanced up from his notes and smiled—weakly, sadly—as Rlain\nhummed to the Lost. Sebarial nodded.\nAladar, however, looked down, not meeting his eyes. “He failed,\nRenarin. I loved him too, but I can’t lie. He came up here to save\nhumankind, and he failed. The enemy destroyed him, took the power, and\nwon the very world.”\n“No more highstorm,” Teshav said. “You’ve seen the Everstorm\ngrowing?” Beneath them, a blackness was moving to cover the entire land.\nEverything but Urithiru itself. “The world is doomed. It’s inevitable now\n…”\nBoth sentiments, Renarin knew, would be prevalent in the years to come.\nHis father would be remembered as a brave hero who failed.\nGlys had another take on it.\nHe found a way forward, the spren said. The only way forward. I feel it,\nRenarin, but I do not understand it. I think we will eventually.

He had seen his father burning in his\nvisions, for some reason, not made into stone. They weren’t always right.\nBut that didn’t mean they were always wrong either. Dalinar had died.\nRlain embraced him. Renarin appreciated it—because although\nembracing in front of others was embarrassing, they needed to see that\nsinger and human could work together.\nThey started toward the steps. At the top of them, Renarin joined Jasnah\nin turning back to face the body—lying on blood-soaked blankets.\n“I wanted you to see him up here,” Jasnah said. “Before we moved him.”\n“Thank you,” Renarin said. “And thank you for letting me speak to the\nhighprinces. I … I think I needed that.”\n“We have difficult days ahead, Renarin,” Jasnah said, her voice strangely\nfrail. “Days I hoped to prevent. But everything I’ve striven to achieve has\ncollapsed, and everything I thought I knew … is no more …”\nHe raised his hand toward her, and let her nod before hugging her, as had\nalways been their way.\n“Come,” Jasnah said, walking back down. “Your father’s work is\nfinished. Ours is merely beginning.”\nRenarin followed. He would discover why his father had given up the\npower to the enemy. Because if Glys was right, then in that decision, they\nwould find their only way forward. Into a future that, for once in a long\nwhile, Renarin knew nothing about.\nSzeth-son-Neturo awoke in a land covered by darkness. Not pitch-black,\nbut dark as the hateful hour, the time between moons. Crackling red\nlightning, more or less constant, gave some relief to the night. The ground\ntrembled in a way he’d never experienced before. Rumbling periodically,\nlike a counterpoint to the thunder. It felt like distant mountains collapsing.\nHe stared upward, thinking he must be dead, until the pain of his body\nconvinced him otherwise. He groaned, reaching with his left hand to probe\nat his pained side, and found his right arm was gone, and even part of his\nshoulder. The skin was tender, and the wrongness of the missing limb was\ndisorienting. Like being in a nightmare, or in someone else’s body.\nHe rolled over, his clothing loose and burned. Then he groaned again as\nhe found the corpse of Kaladin Stormblessed on the ground nearby. No\nbreath, no pulse, his eyes pits of blackness. The Honorblades and Heralds\nwere gone.\nSzeth bowed his head. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “After all you did for\nme, Ishu killed you, didn’t he?”\nSzeth wished he could find tears. He just felt … so overwhelmed. So\nnumb. Did that mean he was callous?\n“Sylphrena?” he called. “Sylphrena, are you here?”"

He crawled, one-handed,\nshuffling and searching until he found Nightblood, sheathed, on the ground.\nSzeth. I killed him, didn’t I? I killed Kaladin …\n“No,” Szeth said. “His eyes were burned. He was stabbed by a\nShardblade, Nightblood. You took a few of his fingers, but you didn’t kill\nhim. You stopped.”\nBut you … your arm …\n“A price I paid to save my family,” he said. “You did that.

That is him, in the sky.\nSzeth gazed up at blackness. The ground trembled again, enough to\nmake him stumble. Once it subsided, he looked toward Kaladin. He would\n… have to find help to bury the man. He couldn’t manage it one-handed\nwith no tools.\nWhat do we do? Nightblood asked.\n“I was told to live better,” Szeth said. “And I will. My people will need\nhelp with what is to come, and I believe there are still better Skybreakers to\nbe found.”\nAnd so Szeth-son-Neturo, the last bearer of Truth of Shinovar, put his\nsword to his shoulder and started walking.

She had also failed in protecting Thaylen City.\nShe’d given up the Shattered Plains, recognizing that a treaty was the\nbest choice—but that was inconsequential without the Oathgates.

She pulled the covers around herself.\nHer father was long dead. Her mother was in a coma. Her brother had been\nslain. Her uncle had died failing to protect the planet. And now, even Wit\nwas gone.\nWorst of all, Taravangian had been right. At every point, he had been\nright. About her. About everything.\nShe hadn’t felt so utterly alone since that day she’d been locked away as\na child. And there was no one to dry her tears as she shook, trying to hold it\nback, curled up in her bed. Overwhelmed, worn out, and—worst of all—\nwrong.\nVenli sat at the edge of the main plateau of Narak, looking toward a sunset\nshe could not see. Black clouds and red lightning stretched in all directions,\nblocking the sunlight.\nA day had passed since Odium’s Ascension to Retribution. He had\nspoken to them, via messenger. He would be in touch. For now, the listeners\nwere allowed his Light to fuel their powers, should they wish it. The\nmessenger also explained that they could use it to grow crops, as Stormlight\nhad once done.\nThey received this Light once a day, at midnight, by placing their\nspheres beneath the sky and asking him to bless them. Retribution asked for\nnothing in exchange, and had promised he did not see himself as their god.\nOnly an interested party wishing to offer them help.\nThey had done as instructed last night, testing his word, and now had\nfilled gemstones.

With that, they could survive in this land. Their need to do\nso, however, worried her. Would that she had her sister’s wisdom to advise.\nShe thought of Eshonai, and watching the sunset together on these plateaus.\nThinking of her gave Venli a sense of peace. Even with the terrible\nstorm. And she wondered … was this what redemption felt like? This\nuncertainty that she could have done more, mixing with a thrill of having\ncome home at last?\nTimbre thrummed to Hope.\nVenli’s mother approached—she’d gone to get tea—and settled down,\nsaying nothing, but offering a cup to Venli. Together they hummed.\nThis may not be redemption, Venli thought. Not yet. Maybe just …\natonement. The redemption comes later, after we see if I can keep\nimproving.\nThe treaty sat beside her, in its waterproof pouch. Eshonai hadn’t been\nable to get the humans to listen, but somehow Venli had. It wasn’t a\ncompetition, and she had to keep that in mind. But this land was theirs\nagain.\n“Venli!” a voice called. She turned to see Bila waving to her. Venli\nlooked to her mother, who hummed to Tension.\nThey went running past lounging chasmfiends—including some who had\njust arrived, carrying more listeners here from the edge of the plateaus. She\nalso passed a couple of Fused who hadn’t left yesterday, when El had called\nthe retreat. They had asked to stay. That group included the Husked One\nshe’d seen the other night on the plateau, staring at the sky.\nHe had been a farmer many thousands of years ago, and was now\nchatting with them—animated in a way he hadn’t been before. Venli ran\npast him to the building where, using Retribution’s gifted Light, she’d\nsecretly made a passage downward, and had found the underground pool to\nbe empty.\nNow, with her mother and Bila, she reached the pool and found the\nstrange too-thick liquid returning. Welling up from the ground. The color\nwas different, a brilliant black-blue. A new tone accompanied it, pulsing to\na new rhythm. The … Rhythm of War? She knew its name instinctively.\n“What does it mean?” Thude asked her, looking up from where he knelt\nby the gathering pool of blue-black liquid light.\n“It means,” she said softly, “that we have a very powerful duty, Thude.\nOur little land is going to be important to the coming world.”\n“Why can’t anyone ever just leave us alone?” Bila asked.\n“That’s not how the world works, Bila,” Venli said. “We have to be part\nof life. I guess … that’s what our leaders decided, along with Eshonai, all\nthose years ago when they went to meet the humans. Yes, our ancestors\nwalked away.” She looked to the light. “We, in turn, have to come back. We\nmake a nation, a strong one, for any singer who wants to join us. Anyone\nwho seeks to listen, and hear, the peaceful rhythm in the stillness of the\nstorm’s heart.”"

Anyone\nwho seeks to listen, and hear, the peaceful rhythm in the stillness of the\nstorm’s heart.”\nThe others nodded, humming to Determination, as they watched the new\ngod’s power fill this hidden well.\nThis account will not be without flaws. But it is the best I have\nbeen able to create from available information—and from the\nwitness of my husband, Szeth, and the witness of the black sword\nhe bears. For I myself helped him bury the Knight of Wind’s body,\nthe day after Stormfall.\nThe day that everything changed.\n—From Knights of Wind and Truth, an account of the\ncleansing of Shinovar by Masha-daughter-Shaliv, six\nyears following Stormfall, page 292\nWit woke in a bed somewhere far from Roshar. A place with soil, budding\nskyscrapers, and firearms.\nIt had worked. He would continue to exist.\nHe sat up and stretched, feeling remarkably hale for someone who had\nbeen completely vaporized by a deity. But, well, they didn’t make deities\nlike they once had. He had been part of the group who had seen to that.\nHe stood, found he was naked, and rifled through the drawers in the\ndresser by the far wall. Everything was still here, placed as he’d left it years\nago, regularly laundered per his instructions.\nExcellent. He dressed. It was … it was all going to …\nWell, he couldn’t tell himself that lie, could he? It wasn’t all going to\nwork out. Damnable Dalinar Kholin had made the absolute wrong choice.\nWit slumped down into his bed and closed his eyes. He could feel his\nLightweaver powers, but the distance between him and Design—who had\nbeen left on Roshar—was so vast, he doubted he’d be able to do much with\nthem for now. The protections he had instituted for her would hopefully\nfunction—but he wouldn’t be able to summon her as a Blade for now.\n“Great art,” Wit whispered, running his hand through his hair, which was\nwhite in this body. “Is about …” About what? “… about novelty. Yes. It\ncomes back to novelty once again, you see.”\nThe door creaked open and Ulaam stepped in. As usual, the creature\nwore its skin an ashen grey. “Ah, Hoid. Our little experiment worked,\nhmmmm? I found you on the floor of my laboratory earlier this morning!”\n“Thank you,” Wit … no, Hoid … said, “for keeping that cell culture\nalive.” His body regenerated from the largest piece of flesh he had\nremaining. He’d always known this, but had never found opportunity to,\nwell, weaponize it.\n“This can be of great use, don’t you think?” Ulaam asked. He hesitated,\nstraightening the cuffs of his black suit. “Was it painful, vaporizing\nyourself?”\n“Odium did it for me.”\n“Oh? Hmm …” Ulaam grew more solemn. “I see. Then the rumors about\nRoshar are true?”\n“I need a seon right away,” Hoid said, standing again. “I need to find out\nwhat’s happening.”\n“We’re already trying!” Ulaam said. “But time appears to be passing far"

Quite the slowness bubble around the planet, yes indeed,\nhmmmm? Why, I bet it will be months before we have the full story!\nMonths for us. Hours for them.”\nMonths? When Shards died, combined, or otherwise distorted, strange\nevents could follow. Harmony’s creation had involved the remaking of a\nworld, while Ambition’s death had destroyed several. The formation of\nRetribution … caused time dilation?\nThat could be an enormous hassle. “I need to get back immediately.”\n“Hoid,” Ulaam said, “if you go, you’ll be trapped in that bubble. We’ll\nlose you for who knows how long, and events are transpiring. Autonomy is\nmoving. I have a message I’m certain is from Taldain, though the planet\nshould be unreachable. Think carefully before you return to Roshar,\nhmmmm?”\nHoid sat back on his bed. Ulaam left some broadsheets for him, as well\nas a short report on everything they knew about Roshar so far, then\nretreated. When Hoid read it, the depth of his own failures at last sank into\nhim.\n“Novelty,” Hoid whispered, running his hand through his hair again.\n“Yes, novelty. The unexpected. It … I …”\nSomewhere dear to him, a new storm was blowing. A storm that would\nstrangle all plant life, and kill everyone unless Retribution intervened.\nSomewhere dear to him, a continent was trembling and breaking as a god\nwas absorbed. Spren would be slaughtered unless a miracle happened.\nSomewhere dear to him, Design was alone, and his former apprentice\ncarried a vitally powerful artifact, unaware of the damage it would do to his\nsoul. Friends had been cast adrift, without guidance. A woman he’d loved.\nYouths he’d mentored. He’d told himself he would sacrifice Roshar for the\ngood of the cosmere, but at the end he hadn’t been so certain. And now it\nseemed it was going to be sacrificed anyway, just not for the good of\nanyone or anything.\nIt would take months for him to get back. And if he did … the greater\ncosmere would suffer. For Odium had not only been unleashed, he had\nbecome something that would rival even Harmony in power.\n“Novelty?” Hoid whispered. “Who am I to speak of novelty? I’m far, far\ntoo late for that. Betrayal isn’t anything new, you see, not for me. Would\nthat it were.”\nHe could not return. The people of Roshar, including those he loved,\nwere on their own. He had to protect Scadrial first, because they absolutely\ncould not afford to lose this planet too. What had Dalinar been thinking?\nWhy had he …\nWait.\nHoid’s eyes opened.\nCould it be …\nHe closed his eyes, took a small bone from his pocket, and reached out\nto the meditative realm of the dragons—where he’d always be an interloper."

The same room, apparently, where the\nPrime was traditionally chosen.\nIt had been about a month and a half since the confrontation between\nOdium and Dalinar. Outside, rain beat against the metal rooftop with a\nclatter. That sound—for the first few days—had nearly driven him insane.\nNow it was just background noise.\nNoura settled at the table, as did most of the nine Unoathed—the ten\nincluding Adolin—who had taken up Shards to save Azimir. They had\nBlades and Plate for others to join them, thirty-seven in total. So far they’d\nbeen cautious about progressing, until they decided their next steps.\nThe long conference table flickered with weevilwax candles—a stock\nthat the city was working furiously to replenish. Compared to the steady,\nfamiliar light of spheres, the candles were harsh and terrible. Like shouts\nwhen he was accustomed to kind words.\nAdolin looked to Yanagawn, again dressed in his regalia—though the\nyoung man could summon his Plate and Blade like a Radiant at any\nmoment. Somehow, their armor and swords worked without Stormlight. In\ncontrast to those of ordinary Shardbearers—whose Blades could not be\nbonded and Plate could not be repaired—the armaments of the Unoathed\nstill functioned. Maya said something had been done at the end by the\nHeralds to shield and protect the spren—and this was a side effect.\nRadiants could still summon Blades and Plate too, but Adolin’s\nUnoathed could do it without Surges or oaths. They were something new.\n“All right, Adolin,” Noura said. “Are you going to tell us why you\nbrought us here? You finally have news?” Thankfully he could still\nunderstand when people spoke Azish, though the Connection that Dalinar\nhad made for him was starting to slip. It now took Adolin a few minutes\nevery morning before the words started making sense.\n“Maya has returned,” he explained, “from her trip to Urithiru.” As the\nOathgates and the spanreeds no longer functioned, sending her seemed the\nbest way. Normal Radiant spren were unable to travel to the other side. But\nMaya … with whatever strange bond she had with Adolin … could.\n“And?” Yanagawn asked.\nAdolin took a deep breath. “My father is dead.”\nHe braced himself as he said it. The pain was still raw, and anguishspren\ncongregated at his feet. But he forced himself onward, recounting what\nMaya had learned from the spren who gathered at Urithiru, in Shadesmar.\nOdium had won, and the world was now his—everything but Azir.

Well,\nand Urithiru—but it was now inside a strange glass bubble, and people in\nthe Physical Realm couldn’t get in or out. Renarin had freed Ba-Ado-\nMishram, and didn’t know what that meant for the world.\n“Radiants still have powers in Urithiru itself,” he explained, “which is\nhow we were able to get this information. Jasnah can look into Shadesmar\nand speak to the spren there, but no one can leave Urithiru in the Physical\nRealm, and Radiants across the world are unable to use their powers.”\n“But we can summon our Blades and Plate,” Notum said, standing on the\ntable, small sized. “Indeed, our spren seem to be recovering.”\n“Xorm continues to improve,” the emperor agreed—naming the spren of\nhis sword. “Whatever your brother did, Adolin, it has helped the deadeyes.”\nI concur, Maya said. Every deadeye I met—even those not part of our\ngroup—is healing. Adolin, I saw my reflection, and I have eyes again. The\nscratches remain like faded scars, but I have eyes.\n“Yet we have no Stormlight,” Noura said. “And that storm … it doesn’t\nstop. It rains and it blows. For over a month straight.”\nThe words chilled Adolin. The Everstorm blanketed the entire land—not\nas violent as it had been at times, true, but pervasive. It seemed that in\nexpanding it to the entire continent, Odium had been forced to let it weaken.\nIt was wind and rain, mostly, with little lightning. At least the quaking of\nthe ground had stilled for the most part, though the news they gathered of\nchanges to the landscape terrified him.\nAzimir had been spared that. They’d felt only rumbles in the distance as\nthe world trembled at the coming of a new god. Worse, that storm would\nstrangle the world. No spanreeds for communication. No Oathgates. No …\nNo healing. He looked at the missing portion of his leg, where he wore\nthe single piece of Plate that grew a metal kind of leg and foot, with three\nlarge toe-like portions. He was getting quite proficient with it, but still had\nbeen hoping to have his actual foot back. Now …\nWell, storms. He’d gotten off easy. His father …\nHis father had failed to protect them, but only so much could be\nexpected of one man. Others would curse Dalinar in coming days, but\nAdolin would not be one of them. For a part of him had known what had\nhappened since that day—when he’d felt a surreal sense of love and\napology from his father.\nAdolin had survived that terrible night by telling himself he needed to\nsee his father again, to make amends. He felt that last parting gift from\nDalinar, but was still sad. He’d never have the chance to look Dalinar in the\neyes again.\nDamnation, that hurt.\n“Well,” Kushkam said. “We ten are not beaten. We are Shardbearers, and\ncan grow our ranks for as long as the others who came with Maya are\nwilling.”\n“We also have all those Radiants at Urithiru,” May added. “They have"

Shallan reportedly lived, for which\nhe was incredibly relieved. Former Oathgate spren had confirmed it to\nMaya. She had lingered at Urithiru for a few days, the spren there said, but\nhad left on a ship. He worried for her, and was terrified he might not be able\nto see her again if the Oathgates didn’t work.\nRoshar was now a world without Stormlight. Could Shallan ever return\nto the Physical Realm?\nAlmighty help them. What were they going to do?\n“Everyone!” The door slammed open, revealing Zabra, her hair in braids\nand wearing an outfit with hokra—those were the patterns delineating\nstation—proclaiming her a Shardbearer. “Everyone, come outside!”\nThey looked to each other. Noura drew her lips to a line—she did not\nlike how familiar Zabra was with the emperor, but could say nothing.\nYanagawn considered each of the Unoathed to be of a rank permitted to\nspeak with him—and in fact gloried in the opportunity. He and Gezamal\nmust have played dozens of games of towers over the last weeks.\nThe emperor finally had friends. Noura would learn to deal with it.\n“Zabra?” Yanagawn asked. “What is it?”\n“The rain,” she said. “It’s ending.”\nThey piled out of the room. Adolin was last, and on the side table, he\nfound the book he’d placed there. One from which he was, haltingly,\nlearning to read. Because if he couldn’t ever see his father again, he could\ntry to understand the man.\nBy reading his own words.\nAdolin tucked Oathbringer under his arm, and followed the others out of\nthe palace. Miraculously, the clouds were indeed breaking. He stepped into\nsunlight, blinking at the familiar glow. It was like a rank of diligent soldiers\nshoving back the enemy forces at long last. Brilliant and shining down, a\ncolumn of light like his father used to make.\nThere, Adolin felt a warmth he could not explain. Perhaps just from the\nsunlight, but it seemed something more. Book snug under his arm, he felt\nlike somewhere his father was smiling at him. Adolin quietly raised his fist\nover his head, saluting the triumphant sun.\nThey found in coming weeks that the sunlight extended exactly to the\nedge of Azir. The rest of the land, Shinovar included, would remain cloaked\nin eternal night. The barriers of the Purelake had broken, and flooding had\nclaimed many nearby lowlands, further isolating Azir.\nHowever, the enemy could not touch this land. Small though it might\nseem, a light would remain in Roshar.\nShallan, swathed in a long cloak, kept her head down as she worked her\nway through the crowd of spren. There were some few humans here, so she\nwasn’t too obvious. And she was glad for the cloak, as Shadesmar had felt\nstrangely cold ever since that day, months ago now, when Retribution had"

And she was glad for the cloak, as Shadesmar had felt\nstrangely cold ever since that day, months ago now, when Retribution had\nbeen born.\nShe managed to push to the front of the crowd, which waited beside a\ncrater in the obsidian ground. It was empty.\nShe breathed out. Yes, she’d heard. But she’d wanted to see it for herself.\nThis had been Cultivation’s Perpendicularity, the pool at the top of the\nHorneater Peaks, the place where most people entered or left the Physical\nRealm. They’d been able to do so here for millennia.\nIt had vanished when Cultivation had fled Roshar. Shallan stared at the\nhole for a long time, feeling unsettled—like many of the people who\ncamped at its rim, waiting. She knew that … that she’d probably stay as\nwell, for a time. Because there was a community here, and hope—frail\nhope.\nShe was … she was trapped in Shadesmar.\nMonths of travel and hoping desperately. Now it finally sank in. She\nmight never escape this realm.\nShe might never see Adolin again.\nHer hands went to her stomach, cradling it. Oh … oh storms.\nIt took an embarrassingly long time for her to recover. Fortunately, the\npart of her that was Radiant was able to assess the situation. There was food\nand water here, transported from offworld—and regular shipping lanes were\nplanned to Urithiru, where Towerlight would also allow manifesting and the\ncreation of food and water for humans.\nShe could survive. She had to. Not just for herself.\nPlus, there had to be ways back into the Physical Realm. Retribution\nwould have a perpendicularity somewhere, even if Odium’s had never been\nlocated. Radiant powers at Urithiru still functioned, which meant there was\na chance an Elsecaller—well, only Jasnah for now—would finally figure\nout how to transfer other people between realms.\nHope. Shallan would find a way.\nShe trudged back among the tents and shanties, crossing wooden ground\nthat floated here—Haka’alaku, a city built around the perpendicularity,\ncovered seven distinct islands with floating wooden platforms between. It\nwas of impressive size, ruled by the peakspren. Their egalitarian ways\nmeant that even humans were in their senate, as anyone who lived here long\nenough was granted citizenship.\nOf course, the Fused actually ruled. But they allowed the local\ngovernment to do its thing. Shallan pulled her cloak tighter and quieted her\narmor spren—who rode in the pouches at her belt, and had begun to\nwhisper her name again, as she hadn’t paid attention to them in a while.\nShe wound back to where she’d left Pattern and Testament, watching a\nspecific camp among the hundreds on the outskirts of the city. Tents set up\non the floating boards, space rented at a very cheap price in the local\ncurrency—bits of metal, of all things. She’d been able to sell some clothing,\nwhich was of value here because it wasn’t manifested.\nShe nodded to her spren, not looking as several Fused flew overhead.\nTheir powers still worked.\nThe Fused offer another opportunity, Shallan thought. If their Light\nfunctions, they might be able to make a perpendicularity somehow. I will"

Felt, a foreigner with drooping mustaches,\nhad once been one of Dalinar’s good friends. He’d then been one of\nAdolin’s soldiers, and their guide on the way to Lasting Integrity.\nLastly, he’d turned out to be a traitor. A Ghostblood.\nWhen she took down her hood, his face went so white, he looked like he\nwas about to pass out.\n“I just want to talk to him,” Shallan said.\n“Him?” Felt asked.\n“Your leader. The Lord of Scars. Is it possible? Do the seons still work?”\n“Yes,” Felt admitted. “Kind of.”\n“I need to use yours,” Shallan said. “It’s the least you can do for me,\nFelt. Besides, I have news that you might find relevant.”\nSigzil walked, cloak pulled tight, tongue dry in his mouth from thirst.\nHe was often thirsty here, but the power had begun to sustain him. The\nthing Wit called a “Dawnshard.” It … it kept him alive. And changed him.\nHe could … sense things he had never been able to before. He saw the\nworld in new ways.\nHe’d spent months crossing the bead oceans by begging passage,\ndodging Fused and keeping his head down, and was now accustomed to the\ndark sky. The one that reminded him of the Shattered Plains as he’d last\nseen them, before …\nBefore …\nHe kept walking. Across the black obsidian, for some reason not sleepy,\nthough he felt tired. He’d been unable to sleep since that day when Wit had\ngiven him this burden.\nA burden Sigzil would protect. He’d prove himself. Redeem himself. He\n…\nHe just kept walking.\nOn. And on. Until at last he saw something on the otherwise featureless\nobsidian expanse. Lights. As he approached, those soon resolved into a long\nline of people, most of them with golden hair and carrying torches that gave\noff light but not heat.\nSigzil let out a sigh of relief. He’d found the Iriali caravan that was\ntraveling offworld, as spoken of by some of the spren he’d encountered in\nhis journey. He’d sought out Vienta first, of course. He hadn’t found her,\nbut she’d sent him a message. She didn’t want to speak to him, but she\nlived. Healed by whatever had happened at the End of All Things.\nHe didn’t blame her for rejecting him. He’d consigned her—both had\nbelieved—to a painful half existence. He had done it to save her, and the\nnote she’d sent acknowledged that, but she still didn’t want to see him.\nThe caravan was much bigger than he’d anticipated, stretching far into\nthe distance. The guards at the perimeter questioned him, then sent him to a\nspecific section near the end. The Iriali allowed foreign travelers to join\nthem, so long as they behaved themselves and worked for their keep. They\nalso thought it best if you stayed with your own kind."

With\nKaladin.”\nSigzil perked up. “You … know Kaladin?”\n“Briefly, I knew him. I can tell you of his time in Shinovar, though I do\nnot know the end of his quest there.

Any of us can. There are some\nin the caravan, even some windspren and other smaller ones. Cultivation\nfled, and it was her bond with Honor, and their agreement with Odium, that\nlocked us here.” The spren hesitated, then leaned forward. “Can I tell you a\nsecret, Windrunner?”\n“Sure,” Sigzil said. “Why not?”\n“I’m a failure,” the spren confessed. “I think maybe most of us highspren\nare. I don’t want to be a bother, but these Iriali mostly ignore me, and I\nreally, really need someone to talk to. Please? I will tell you of Kaladin.”\nSigzil shrugged. “Go ahead. I’ll listen.”\n“Well, thank you,” the spren replied. “It started when Dalinar sent us to\n—”\n“Wait,” Sigzil said, frowning. “You’re Szeth’s spren?”\n“I was,” the spren said, then hung his head. “He rejected me.”\nSigzil grunted. “You have a name?”\n“I used to have one.

And he\nlistened to the spren’s story, sitting in a daze and trying not to be frightened\nof the way his very body seemed to be changing to adapt to the power he\nheld.\nWit had promised to find him soon though. Until then, Sigzil could do\nthis one task. He’d hold the secret.\nTalking to Thaidakar, the Lord of Scars, was odd for Shallan. The seon—\nAla—could indeed contact the Ghostblood leader.

        "text": "Talking to Thaidakar, the Lord of Scars, was odd for Shallan. The seon—\nAla—could indeed contact the Ghostblood leader. No Stormlight needed.\nThe Ghostblood leader, in turn, was willing to talk to Shallan. And\nfortunately, old Thaidakar didn’t seem too angry at hearing Iyatil and\nMraize were dead. Shallan kept a close eye on Felt anyway; storms, she was\nso exposed and vulnerable without any way to heal herself.\nYes, it all worked as she sat in Felt’s tent, communicating through the\nseon spren. There was only one problem.\n“You’re in some kind of planet-wide slowness bubble,” old Thaidakar\nexplained, his face a hovering globe of light, imitated by Ala. It had a spike\nthrough one eye. “The clash of two Shards, including the near destruction\nof your world, followed by the combining of those two Shards into one? It’s\ndone something to the Spiritual Realm near your planet, changing the way\ntime flows for you.\n“You think we’re communicating directly, but the better part of an hour\npasses here between each of your replies to me. You think it has been a few\nmonths, but it has been years for us. Ala has to slow down and repeat this as\na recording—for if I spoke in real time, you’d hear only a quick blip.”\nShallan took that in. “So if I leave to get help from other planets …”\nThe face shook, then re-formed. “Yes, if you left and traveled to another\nworld, decades might pass for you. I don’t recommend it, unless there is\nnobody you care about—because when you return, you will be much older\nthan they are.”\nShe pulled her cloak closer, feeling cold. “How long will this effect last?\nCan you guess?”\nThe face froze, then shook, then spoke again, and it looked like his hair\nhad been brushed. “We’ve been calculating. Seems like the time dilation is\nslowing around Roshar, and the worst was at the start, but it’s going to be a\nwhile yet. Maybe … seventy or eighty years from now, you’ll realign with\ncosmere standard? That will seem like a decade or so for you.”\nShe nodded. Waiting for more, but of course he was getting this—\napparently—as messages spread across a few hours. He wouldn’t be\nwatching for a head nod.\n“Have you thought about my proposal?” she asked Thaidakar.\nHe fuzzed again. Then responded. “I have. I don’t know if I can make\npeace with you, Kholin. Killing Iyatil went too far. I accept that she must\nbear the consequences of her brutality, but she was my colleague—and her\nbrother will need to be told what happened. He doesn’t know yet. We’ve\nhad our own crisis here recently.\n“However, without Stormlight—and with Mishram freed—our interests\non Roshar are minimized. I doubt Iyatil’s brother will insist on coming to\nseek vengeance against you immediately. He’s more likely going to try to\nbreak away from me—so I might have a little civil war on my hands. If his\nagents do arrive on Roshar, they’ll be your enemies.\n“So for now, let us consider it a truce between us, but not one between"

The truth is, you’re just too small to worry\nabout right now, Kholin. Odium is not only free, he’s picked up a second\nShard. The worst that could happen, has happened. From here it will be\nwar. I’d focus on that if I were you. Dark days are coming.”\n“Then I demand one thing,” Shallan said. “A payment for what yours did\nto me and mine. For the murders Iyatil and Mraize committed in your\nname.”\nA pause. A fuzzing. Two words. “What price?”\n“This seon spren obeys you, works for you,” Shallan said. “I want it to\njoin me instead, and work under my direction until I can sort through a few\nthings.”\nThis response took longer. Probably hours for him.\n“Ala is not a slave,” he finally said, “but I’ve asked her. She … agrees\nthat we owe you something. She will enter your employ, so long as you’re\nwilling to let her report back to me of events on Roshar as she sees them.”\n“Fine.”\n“A deal, then,” he said. “We are settled. A clever bargain on your part—\nyou can hire out her services to others at a steep price, which will give you\nincome in Shadesmar. Farewell for now, Shallan Kholin.”\nThe face vanished, again becoming a ball of light, which bobbed for\nShallan. “So …” the ball said. “I guess … I might have to earn back your\ntrust …”\n“You never will, but that won’t prevent us from working together.”\nShallan looked to Felt. “What about you?”\n“I’m used to this kind of thing,” he said, with a shrug. “One mess after\nanother, doing my job. With Lord Dalinar and Lord Mraize dead … well,\nguess Malli and I will have to find someone else to serve. If our old bodies\ncan manage it.”\nShallan stood up and pushed out of the tent, and waved for the ball to\nfollow her. She was well aware she was inviting a spy for Thaidakar into\nher midst again, but she had a distinct purpose this time.\nShe joined Pattern and Testament, who was increasingly verbal these\ndays, her scratches almost completely faded, her pattern more vibrant.\nShallan explained what she’d discovered to them, then looked at the seon.\n“Spren,” she said to it. “Wit had one of you in the tower, and he used it\nto communicate. Are there others in this land you know of?”\n“Yes,” she admitted. “A small number.” She paused. “I can contact Olo,\nwho worked for your Wit. We’ve been chatting. Olo fled the tower at his\nmaster’s suggestion months ago, and is weaving toward the Shattered\nPlains.”\n“Contact him,” Shallan said. “And tell him I have a job for him, if he’s\nwilling. But I need him to go to Azimir.”\n“Azimir? Olo tends to like to be helpful, so I suspect he’ll go, but why\nAzimir?”"

Olo tends to like to be helpful, so I suspect he’ll go, but why\nAzimir?”\nShallan just bade her ask, feeling a grim determination. She had no idea\nhow she’d get back to the Physical Realm, but for now … if this worked,\nshe’d at least be able to talk to Adolin. As she waited for Ala to contact the\nother seon spren, she looked up at the sky. There were no more clouds in\nShadesmar. Only darkness and a distant, frail sun, too small to offer\nwarmth.\nDark days were coming, Thaidakar said.\nHe was wrong in that.\nThey had most certainly already arrived.\nIt was months, by mortal time on Roshar—years outside it—before\nRetribution could spare a thought for Roshar itself. He quickly checked that\nthe land was progressing as he wanted. There was turmoil, and the\ngeography had been broken in ways he hadn’t anticipated.\nDalinar. Foolish, stubborn Dalinar.\nDalinar Kholin, the man who had known.\nTaravangian emerged into the Spiritual Realm in his avatar form, joining\na vision he himself had created and kept going indefinitely. It was populated\nby tens of thousands of people.\nHis daughter. His grandchildren. Adrotagia.\nEach of whom was real, and not a fake made of this realm.\nKharbranth was dead, but in the moment that Cultivation had looked\naway, Taravangian had summoned his power and taken the people. The city\nhad indeed been destroyed, but he’d saved the occupants. In utter secret.\nIn the Spiritual Realm, he’d created for them a clone of Kharbranth. He\nwalked its streets, knowing them to be fake, while no one living here did.\nHe’d taken from them any memory of Cultivation’s killers, whom he’d left\nto die in the city, and had instead implanted in their minds an impression\nthat those who were missing had died of a strange disease. That had started\nwith the city guards.\nHe walked to the palace and into his throne room, where Adrotagia—\nreal, not a construct of visions—was meeting with some former members of\nthe Diagram. “Vargo,” she said. So far as she now remembered, he had not\ndied.\nSo far as any of them knew, everything had turned out well. Peace had\nbeen made, though they were required to stay in their city. He embraced\nher, then walked to his throne. He settled down there, and called for his\ngrandchildren to be brought to visit. He held them as they crawled into his\nlap.\nThe entire city would persist in here, isolated and protected from\nwhatever he did in the cosmere. One perfect place of peace and love.\nHis secret. His dangerous, shameful secret. Because in the end, although\nno one could ever know it, there were things even Taravangian—in a\nmoment of pain and passion—had refused to sacrifice.\nHe embraced his grandchildren, weeping, and the power simmered.\nHating Dalinar Kholin.\nFor having been right.\nAll art,” Hoid said, “is secretly improvisation.”\nThe other people in the waiting room glanced at him, giving him dark"

        "text": "Hating Dalinar Kholin.\nFor having been right.\nAll art,” Hoid said, “is secretly improvisation.”\nThe other people in the waiting room glanced at him, giving him dark\nlooks. He sat primly in his coachman’s uniform, hat under his arm. He’d\ndusted off his old beggar’s costume—well, it was supposed to be dirty, so\nhe’d more dusted onto it—for an appearance here and there. However, he\nwanted to be gainfully occupied. And stay close to some important, relevant\npeople who tended to look poorly on someone who could fill a garden with\ngood topsoil merely by shivering.\n“Art,” Hoid said. “It’s truly improvisation. You realize that, don’t you?”\nThe others ignored him. How rude.\n“You see,” he said, leaning toward a woman waiting to apply for a\nbuttling position, by the advertisement in her fingers. “You can practice,\nand practice, and practice. But then the moment comes, and …” He made a\ngesture with his fingers toward the ceiling, drawing her eyes that way. “And\nthen the lights turn on, and the practice is but a guide.\n“An outline? Well, you start with a blank page either way. And the parts\nwhere you’re forced, by narrative beauty, to toss the outline away?\nImprovisation. Art is improvisation. It’s the brushstrokes you don’t intend,\nbut your instincts know you need anyway. The parts of the story you add for\na specific reader, the expression you make onstage to provoke a gasp. That’s\nthe art.”\nThe woman scooted a little distance away from him.\n“I was wrong with my plans,” he said, staring toward the sky. The\nceiling was in the way, but that didn’t matter. He could imagine it. That was\nbasically the entirety of his job. “I was so meticulous, so deliberate; I tried\nto be so clever. And then poof, it was all destroyed. By a grand act of\nmajestic improvisation.”\nHe could see now what Dalinar Kholin had done. It had taken Hoid\nweeks to grasp what that wonderful, belligerent, spectacular man had done.\nEveryone, Hoid at their forefront, had been ready to walk away again. Their\nproblem safely delayed once more.\nIn one grand stroke, Dalinar had stolen that from them. He’d released the\nlion from its cage, or the whitespine from its den, or the dragon from her\npalace. And he’d given them a huge boost to propel them into being a\ncataclysmic threat, if unchecked. He’d demanded that action be taken, and\nRetribution had been forced to turn from Roshar to deal with greater foes.\nAt first, Hoid had worried this would destroy Roshar. But no, of course it\nwouldn’t, because Retribution would not let himself get caught and killed\nso easily. He’d gone into hiding immediately, but it was very hard for a\nShard to hide—so long as it wanted to influence things, the vibrations\nwould be felt.\nNow, a dance. A game on a grand scale, building to war. One none of\nthem had wanted, because they’d been willing to quietly pretend that it\nwould never happen, and that the murderer who had killed at least three of\ntheir number wasn’t their problem."

And\nduring that time, just maybe, Retribution would assume the place secured\nand loyal.\nWhich gave Roshar a chance.\n“Hoid?” the Ladrian house steward called from the front of the small\nwaiting room.\nHow did he see? Hoid thought, standing up. How did Dalinar find the\nway out? This hadn’t been one of the many more obvious possibilities. It\nhad been a small, insignificant one—as likely as flipping a coin onto the\nsame side a thousand times in a row. None of them had seen it, because\nwhen possibilities were infinite, you could get a tad overwhelmed.\nIt bothered him that few would know what Dalinar had achieved and\nsacrificed. But fortunately, at least one person did know, and he wasn’t\nexactly a quiet type. Dalinar Kholin’s true story would be told. Once the\ntime was right, and Hoid could get back to Roshar.\nThe Ladrian house steward was a plump, middle-aged woman. She had a\nprim jacket and spectacles, and a bright yellow pocket square. The type of\nbold coloring in an otherwise drab outfit that said, “I consider myself a fun-\nloving type—but I decided to study accounting, and I now know seventeen\ndifferent ways to fill out a ledger.”\nFrom her seat behind the desk, the woman looked him up and down,\nspectacles on the end of her nose. Then she studied the application in front\nof her.\n“I believe,” Miss Grimes said, “you’re interested in the coachman job?”\n“I am?” Hoid said. “I suppose that explains this coachman’s jacket, this\ncoachman’s hat, and the application for a coachman’s job filled out by me\nthat you are, indeed, holding at this very moment.”\n“Ah,” the woman said. “A funny type.”\n“Only when the situation does not call for it, ma’am.”\nShe grunted, turning the page. “You realize the pay is terrible.”\n“It always is.”\n“You don’t have any references.”\n“Previous employer is a tad indisposed,” he said, “living on another\nplanet, which is undergoing a brief, but dramatic, world-ending cataclysm.”\nHe leaned forward. “Also, she broke up with me recently, and I don’t think\nI’d get much of a referral.”\nThe woman took that in stride, which improved Hoid’s opinion of her.\n“Well, I can’t be too picky,” the steward said, stamping his application.\n“Seeing as ever since a previous fellow literally ended up driving off a cliff,\nwe’ve had trouble keeping the position filled. You passed the driving test,\nand Jone says you’re good with the horses and know your way around the\ncity, even if you are a little odd. Report in tomorrow. Six sharp.”\n“Thank you, ma’am,” Hoid said, then leaned down farther across the\ntable. “I didn’t know what to do. Thing is, that’s wonderful. That’s the"

Because when the predetermined answers flee, then the solution\ncomes down to who you are. That’s when we see the mettle of a person.\nThat is art: when untested skill meets unplanned catastrophe.”\nThe woman looked up at him, then blinked. “I think I understand.”\n“Wait. Really. You do?”\n“Of course I do,” the woman said. “You’re here for this job because\nabsolutely nobody else will hire you. Good thing you can get a person\nwhere they’re going.”\n“Ma’am,” Hoid said, putting on his hat, “you have no idea.”\nHe turned and walked from the room into the sunlight, already\nimprovising. First, to help guide this crisis on Scadrial. After that …\nWell, hate it though he did, there was only one reasonable choice. With\nRetribution formed, Hoid needed allies—even allies who hated him—who\nknew how to fight gods.\nHe would have to go find Valor. After all that time he’d spent trying to\nmanipulate Dalinar, the old Blackthorn had gone and manipulated Hoid—\nand every single Shard.\n“Brilliant job, my friend,” he said, striding out onto the street. “Brilliant\nstorming job. You’ve given us a chance. Let’s hope we can live up to it.”\nPOSTLUDE TO\nTHE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE\nKalak woke up somewhere bright.\nOn a grassy hillside, where the plants didn’t pull away. Near an ocean. A\nreal ocean beach, and real grass. He thought … he thought he recognized\nthe place.\nAlaswha? But it had been destroyed. How?\nHe shrank down upon himself, huddling on that hillside, when he heard\nvoices. He turned slowly to see people atop the slope. It wasn’t a hill … but\ninstead a little ridge leading down to the sandy beach. Behind it was an\nopen expanse of green.\nPeople stood there. His former friends. The others …\nI didn’t survive, he thought. I died. I’ve gone to Braize.\nThe flesh burning.\nThe fires.\nThe pain, over and over …\nYes, it looked peaceful now, but this must be a new kind of torture. The\nfriendly grass and soothing waves? It would be snatched away. Three of the\nfigures in the group were wrong. That was proof. Who was that soldier in\nKholin blue? That figure he couldn’t quite make out? That was Nale’s\nspren, he supposed. But that woman with white-blue hair, long and\nflowing? She didn’t belong here.\nKalak shuddered, panicking as the man in blue saw him and walked\nover.\n“Hey,” the man said, squatting down on the top of the ridge, a few feet\nfrom Kalak.\n“What lie is this?” Kalak demanded. “What kind of Voidbringer are\nyou?”\n“I’m not one,” the man said. “My name is Kaladin. I’ve … joined you.\nTo replace Jezrien.”\n“Impossible.”\n“You saw me, Kalak, when we asked you to refound the Oathpact. You"

A chance to protect the spren. He’d\ndone that, yes. He … remembered … but it seemed a dream, as did the\nlessening of darkness that had encouraged him forward. He was a wretch,\nand always would be.\nThe man smiled. “Ishar has changed the way the Oathpact functions,\nKalak. He brought our minds here, where the enemy will not be able to\nreach us.”\nWas … was that possible?\nDared he hope?\n“No,” Kalak hissed. “I don’t deserve something like that. I’ve failed\neveryone. I’m worthless.”\n“Not true,” Kaladin said. “Ishar says … says that with the merging of\nHonor and Odium … things are odd. An unexpected warping of time has\nhappened, so it will pass strangely for us. More strangely even than what is\nhappening on Roshar. While years pass there, months will pass for us. We\nhave time, for once, and peace.”\nKalak cringed. “I don’t believe it.”\nThe man, Kaladin, reached out his hand. “Come join us, Kalak. Come\nsee.”\n“No. I’ve failed. It’s too late.” Kalak closed his eyes. “Everything I’ve\ndone … everything I’ve tried … It’s only led to more destruction and\ndoom.”\n“I know how that feels. Trust me.” And there was something …\ncompelling about his voice. Empathetic. Could a Voidbringer fake that?\nKalak opened his eyes.\nKaladin still had his hand outstretched. “Come. At least listen to me. I\nthink I can help you reclaim some of what you used to be.”\n“There’s nothing left,” Kalak said. “The world is doomed. We have\nfailed. Everyone on Roshar is as good as dead.”\n“Then what harm is there,” Kaladin said, “in trying one more time? If\neverything is already doomed?”\n“I …”\n“One more try,” Kaladin whispered. “Just once more.”\n“Once more,” Kalak said. “A … final Return?”\n“We heal,” Kaladin said. “We reclaim ourselves. Then we go back to\nRoshar. This time, we win for real. Instead of coming back withered from\ntorture, you’ll return refreshed. Mended, and we’ll see what we can do\ntogether.”\nOne more try.\nA final Return.\nWhat harm … what harm could there be in it? Still he wavered, ever\nincapable of simply deciding. He wanted to shy away, but then he saw a\nfigure sitting beyond the others. A man with dark skin. A man they’d\nabandoned.\n“Is that Taln?” Kalak asked. “Taln is here? Has he … said anything?”\n“He needs time,” Kaladin said. “And help. So far, he’s only said one\nthing. He said … he forgives you all.”\nA tremble went through Kalak.
