        "text": "Dedication\nFor Oliver Sanderson,\nWho was born during the middle of the writing of this book, and was\nwalking by the time it was done.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nAs you might imagine, producing a book in the Stormlight Archive is a\nmajor undertaking. It involved almost eighteen months of writing, from\noutline to final revision, and includes the artwork of four different\nindividuals and the editorial eyes of a whole host of people, not to mention\nthe teams at Tor who do production, publicity, marketing, and everything\nelse a major book needs in order to be successful.\nFor some two decades now, the Stormlight Archive has been my dream\n—the story I always wished I could tell. The people you’ll read about below\nquite literally make my dreams a reality, and there aren’t words to express\nmy gratitude for their efforts. First in line on this novel needs to be my\nassistant and primary continuity editor, the incumbent Peter Ahlstrom. He\nworked very long hours on this book, putting up with my repeated\ninsistence that things which did not fit continuity actually did—eventually\npersuading me I was wrong far more often than not.\nAs always, Moshe Feder—the man who discovered me as a writer—did\nexcellent editorial work on the book. Joshua Bilmes, my agent, worked hard\non the book in both an agenting and editorial capacity. He’s joined by Eddie\nSchneider, Brady “Words of Bradiance” McReynolds, Krystyna Lopez,\nSam Morgan, and Christa Atkinson at the agency. At Tor, Tom Doherty put\nup with me delivering a book even longer than the last one when I promised\nto make it shorter. Terry McGarry did the copyediting, Irene Gallo is\nresponsible for the art direction for the cover, Greg Collins for interior\ndesign, Brian Lipofsky’s team at Westchester Publishing Services for\ncompositing, Meryl Gross and Karl Gold for production, Patty Garcia and\nher team for publicity. Paul Stevens acted as superman whenever we needed\nhim. A big thanks to all of you.\nYou may have noticed that this volume, like the one before it, includes\namazing art. My vision for the Stormlight Archive has always been of a\nseries that transcended common artistic expectations for a book of its\nnature. As such, it is an honor to once again have my favorite artist, Michael\nWhelan, involved in the project. I feel that his cover has captured Kaladin\nperfectly, and I am extremely grateful for the extra time he spent on the\ncover—at his own insistence—going through three drafts before he was\nsatisfied. To have endpapers of Shallan as well is more than I had hoped to\nsee for the book, and I’m humbled by how well this whole package came\ntogether.\nWhen I pitched the Stormlight Archive, I spoke of having “guest star”\nartists do pieces for the books here and there. We have our first of those in\nthis novel, for which Dan dos Santos (another of my personal favorite\nartists, and the man who did the cover for Warbreaker) agreed to do some\ninterior illustrations.\nBen McSweeney graciously returned to do more brilliant sketchbook\npages for us, and he is a pure delight to work with. Quick to recognize what\nI want, sometimes even when I’m not quite sure what I want, I’ve rarely\nmet a person who mixes talent and professionalism in the way Ben does."

        "text": "I want, sometimes even when I’m not quite sure what I want, I’ve rarely\nmet a person who mixes talent and professionalism in the way Ben does.\nYou can find more of his art at InkThinker.net.\nA long time ago, almost ten years now, I met a man named Isaác\nStewart who—in addition to being an aspiring writer—was an excellent\nartist, particularly when it came to things like maps and symbols. I started\ncollaborating with him on books (starting with Mistborn) and he eventually\nset me up on a blind date with a woman named Emily Bushman—whom I\nsubsequently married. So needless to say, I owe Isaac a few big favors. With\neach progressive book he works on, that debt on my part grows greater as I\nsee the amazing work he has done. This year, we decided to make his\ninvolvement a little more official as I hired him full-time to be an in-house\nartist and to help me with administrative tasks. So if you see him, welcome\nhim to the team. (And tell him to keep working on his own books, which\nare quite good.)\nAlso joining us at Dragonsteel Entertainment is Kara Stewart, Isaac’s\nwife, as our shipping manager. (I actually tried to hire Kara first—and Isaac\npiped up noting that some of the things I wanted to hire her for, he could do.\nAnd it ended up that I got both of them, in a very convenient deal.) She’s\nthe one you’ll interact with if you order T-shirts, posters, or the like through\nmy website. And she’s awesome.\nWe used a few expert consultants on this book, including Matt Bushman\nfor his songwriting and poetry expertise. Ellen Asher gave some great\ndirection on the scenes with horses, and Karen Ahlstrom was an additional\npoetry and song consultant. Mi’chelle Walker acted as Alethi handwriting\nconsultant. Finally, Elise Warren gave us some very nice notes relating to\nthe psychology of a key character. Thank you all for lending me your\nbrains.\nThis book had an extensive beta read done under some strict time\nconstraints, and so a hearty bridgeman salute goes to those who\nparticipated. They are: Jason Denzel, Mi’chelle Walker, Josh Walker, Eric\nLake, David Behrens, Joel Phillips, Jory Phillips, Kristina Kugler, Lyndsey\nLuther, Kim Garrett, Layne Garrett, Brian Delambre, Brian T. Hill, Alice\nArneson, Bob Kluttz, and Nathan Goodrich.\nProofreaders at Tor include Ed Chapman, Brian Connolly, and Norma\nHoffman. Community proofreaders include Adam Wilson, Aubree and Bao\nPham, Blue Cole, Chris King, Chris Kluwe, Emily Grange, Gary Singer,\nJakob Remick, Jared Gerlach, Kelly Neumann, Kendra Wilson, Kerry\nMorgan, Maren Menke, Matt Hatch, Patrick Mohr, Richard Fife, Rob\nHarper, Steve Godecke, Steve Karam, and Will Raboin.\nMy writing group managed to get through about half of the book, which\nis a lot, considering how long the novel is. They are an invaluable resource\nto me. Members are: Kaylynn ZoBell, Kathleen Dorsey Sanderson,\nDanielle Olsen, Ben-son-son-Ron, E. J. Patten, Alan Layton, and Karen"

Patten, Alan Layton, and Karen\nAhlstrom.\nAnd finally, thanks to my loving (and rambunctious) family. Joel,\nDallin, and little Oliver help keep me humble each day by always making\nme be the “bad guy” who gets beat up. My forgiving wife, Emily, put up\nwith a lot this past year, as tours grew long, and I’m still not sure what I did\nto deserve her. Thank you all for making my world one of magic.\nMap of Roshar\nPrologue: To Question\nSIX YEARS AGO\nJasnah Kholin pretended to enjoy the party, giving no indication that she\nintended to have one of the guests killed.\nShe wandered through the crowded feast hall, listening as wine greased\ntongues and dimmed minds. Her uncle Dalinar was in the full swing of it,\nrising from the high table to shout for the Parshendi to bring out their\ndrummers. Jasnah’s brother, Elhokar, hurried to shush their uncle—though\nthe Alethi politely ignored Dalinar’s outburst. All save Elhokar’s wife,\nAesudan, who snickered primly behind a handkerchief.\nJasnah turned away from the high table and continued through the\nroom. She had an appointment with an assassin, and she was all too glad to\nbe leaving the stuffy room, which stank of too many perfumes mingling. A\nquartet of women played flutes on a raised platform across from the lively\nhearth, but the music had long since grown tedious.\nUnlike Dalinar, Jasnah drew stares. Like flies to rotten meat those eyes\nwere, constantly following her. Whispers like buzzing wings. If there was\none thing the Alethi court enjoyed more than wine, it was gossip. Everyone\nexpected Dalinar to lose himself to wine during a feast—but the king’s\ndaughter, admitting to heresy? That was unprecedented.\nJasnah had spoken of her feelings for precisely that reason.\nShe passed the Parshendi delegation, which clustered near the high\ntable, talking in their rhythmic language. Though this celebration honored\nthem and the treaty they’d signed with Jasnah’s father, they didn’t look\nfestive or even happy. They looked nervous. Of course, they weren’t\nhuman, and the way they reacted was sometimes odd.\nJasnah wanted to speak with them, but her appointment would not wait.\nShe’d intentionally scheduled the meeting for the middle of the feast, as so\nmany would be distracted and drunken. Jasnah headed toward the doors but\nthen stopped in place.\nHer shadow was pointing in the wrong direction.\nThe stuffy, shuffling, chattering room seemed to grow distant.\nHighprince Sadeas walked right through the shadow, which quite distinctly\npointed toward the sphere lamp on the wall nearby. Engaged in\nconversation with his companion, Sadeas didn’t notice. Jasnah stared at that\nshadow—skin growing clammy, stomach clenched, the way she felt when\nshe was about to vomit. Not again. She searched for another light source. A\nreason. Could she find a reason? No."

No.\nThe shadow languidly melted back toward her, oozing to her feet and\nthen stretching out the other way. Her tension eased. But had anyone else\nseen?\nBlessedly, as she searched the room, she didn’t find any aghast stares.\nPeople’s attention had been drawn by the Parshendi drummers, who were\nclattering through the doorway to set up. Jasnah frowned as she noticed a\nnon-Parshendi servant in loose white clothing helping them. A Shin man?\nThat was unusual.\nJasnah composed herself. What did these episodes of hers mean?\nSuperstitious folktales she’d read said that misbehaving shadows meant you\nwere cursed. She usually dismissed such things as nonsense, but some\nsuperstitions were rooted in fact. Her other experiences proved that. She\nwould need to investigate further.\nThe calm, scholarly thoughts felt like a lie compared to the truth of her\ncold, clammy skin and the sweat trickling down the back of her neck. But it\nwas important to be rational at all times, not just when calm. She forced\nherself out through the doors, leaving the muggy room for the quiet\nhallway. She’d chosen the back exit, commonly used by servants. It was the\nmost direct route, after all.\nHere, master-servants dressed in black and white moved on errands\nfrom their brightlords or ladies. She had expected that, but had not\nanticipated the sight of her father standing just ahead, in quiet conference\nwith Brightlord Meridas Amaram. What was the king doing out here?\nGavilar Kholin was shorter than Amaram, yet the latter stooped\nshallowly in the king’s company. That was common around Gavilar, who\nwould speak with such quiet intensity that you wanted to lean in and listen,\nto catch every word and implication. He was a handsome man, unlike his\nbrother, with a beard that outlined his strong jaw rather than covering it. He\nhad a personal magnetism and intensity that Jasnah felt no biographer had\nyet managed to convey.\nTearim, captain of the King’s Guard, loomed behind them. He wore\nGavilar’s Shardplate; the king himself had stopped wearing it of late,\npreferring to entrust it to Tearim, who was known as one of the world’s\ngreat duelists. Instead, Gavilar wore robes of a majestic, classical style.\nJasnah glanced back at the feast hall. When had her father slipped out?\nSloppy, she accused herself. You should have checked to see if he was still\nthere before leaving.\nAhead, he rested his hand on Amaram’s shoulder and raised a finger,\nspeaking harshly but quietly, the words indistinct to Jasnah.\n“Father?” she asked.\nHe glanced at her. “Ah, Jasnah. Retiring so early?”\n“It’s hardly early,” Jasnah said, gliding forward. It seemed obvious to\nher that Gavilar and Amaram had ducked out to find privacy for their\ndiscussion. “This is the tiresome part of the feast, where the conversation\ngrows louder but no smarter, and the company drunken.”"

Even her\nmother Navani could not do that to her.\n“Perhaps if you found pleasant associations,” Gavilar said, “you would\nenjoy the feasts.” His eyes swung toward Amaram, whom he’d long fancied\nas a potential match for her.\nIt would never happen. Amaram met her eyes, then murmured words of\nparting to her father and hastened away down the corridor.\n“What errand did you give him?” Jasnah asked. “What are you about\nthis night, Father?”\n“The treaty, of course.”\nThe treaty. Why did he care so much about it? Others had counseled that\nhe either ignore the Parshendi or conquer them. Gavilar insisted upon an\naccommodation.\n“I should return to the celebration,” Gavilar said, motioning to Tearim.\nThe two moved along the hallway toward the doors Jasnah had left.\n“Father?” Jasnah said. “What is it you aren’t telling me?”\nHe glanced back at her, lingering. Pale green eyes, evidence of his good\nbirth. When had he become so discerning? Storms… she felt as if she\nhardly knew this man any longer. Such a striking transformation in such a\nshort time.\nFrom the way he inspected her, it almost seemed that he didn’t trust her.\nDid he know about her meeting with Liss?\nHe turned away without saying more and pushed back into the party, his\nguard following.\nWhat is going on in this palace? Jasnah thought. She took a deep breath.\nShe would have to prod further. Hopefully he hadn’t discovered her\nmeetings with assassins—but if he had, she would work with that\nknowledge. Surely he would see that someone needed to keep watch on the\nfamily as he grew increasingly consumed by his fascination with the\nParshendi. Jasnah turned and continued on her way, passing a master-\nservant, who bowed.\nAfter walking a short time in the corridors, Jasnah noticed her shadow\nbehaving oddly again. She sighed in annoyance as it pulled toward the three\nStormlight lamps on the walls. Fortunately, she’d passed from the populated\narea, and no servants were here to see.\n“All right,” she snapped. “That’s enough.”\nShe hadn’t meant to speak aloud. However, as the words slipped out,\nseveral distant shadows—originating in an intersection up ahead—stirred to\nlife. Her breath caught. Those shadows lengthened, deepened. Figures\nformed from them, growing, standing, rising.\nStormfather. I’m going insane.\nOne took the shape of a man of midnight blackness, though he had a\ncertain reflective cast, as if he were made of oil.

        "text": "certain reflective cast, as if he were made of oil. No… of some other liquid\nwith a coating of oil floating on the outside, giving him a dark, prismatic\nquality.\nHe strode toward her and unsheathed a sword.\nLogic, cold and resolute, guided Jasnah. Shouting would not bring help\nquickly enough, and the inky litheness of this creature bespoke a speed\ncertain to exceed her own.\nShe stood her ground and met the thing’s glare, causing it to hesitate.\nBehind it, a small clutch of other creatures had materialized from the\ndarkness. She had sensed those eyes upon her during the previous months.\nBy now, the entire hallway had darkened, as if it had been submerged\nand was slowly sinking into lightless depths. Heart racing, breath\nquickening, Jasnah raised her hand to the granite wall beside her, seeking to\ntouch something solid. Her fingers sank into the stone a fraction, as if the\nwall had become mud.\nOh, storms. She had to do something. What? What could she possibly\ndo?\nThe figure before her glanced at the wall. The wall lamp nearest Jasnah\nwent dark. And then…\nThen the palace disintegrated.\nThe entire building shattered into thousands upon thousands of small\nglass spheres, like beads. Jasnah screamed as she fell backward through a\ndark sky. She was no longer in the palace; she was somewhere else—\nanother land, another time, another… something.\nShe was left with the sight of the dark, lustrous figure hovering in the\nair above, seeming satisfied as he resheathed his sword.\nJasnah crashed into something—an ocean of the glass beads. Countless\nothers rained around her, clicking like hailstones into the strange sea. She\nhad never seen this place; she could not explain what had happened or what\nit meant. She thrashed as she sank into what seemed an impossibility. Beads\nof glass on all sides. She couldn’t see anything beyond them, only felt\nherself descending through this churning, suffocating, clattering mass.\nShe was going to die. Leaving work unfinished, leaving her family\nunprotected!\nShe would never know the answers.\nNo.\nJasnah flailed in the darkness, beads rolling across her skin, getting into\nher clothing, working their way into her nose as she tried to swim. It was no\nuse. She had no buoyancy in this mess. She raised a hand before her mouth\nand tried to make a pocket of air to use for breathing, and managed to gasp\nin a small breath. But the beads rolled around her hand, forcing between her\nfingers. She sank, more slowly now, as through a viscous liquid.\nEach bead that touched her gave a faint impression of something. A\ndoor. A table. A shoe.\nThe beads found their way into her mouth. They seemed to move on\ntheir own. They would choke her, destroy her. No… no, it was just because\nthey seemed attracted to her. An impression came to her, not as a distinct\nthought but a feeling. They wanted something from her.\nShe snatched a bead in her hand; it gave her an impression of a cup. She\ngave… something… to it?

In a moment she was\nfalling not among individual beads, but through large masses of them stuck\ntogether into the shape of…\nA cup.\nEach bead was a pattern, a guide for the others.\nShe released the one she held, and the beads around her broke apart. She\nfloundered, searching desperately as her air ran out. She needed something\nshe could use, something that would help, some way to survive! Desperate,\nshe swept her arms wide to touch as many beads as she could.\nA silver platter.\nA coat.\nA statue.\nA lantern.\nAnd then, something ancient.\nSomething ponderous and slow of thought, yet somehow strong. The\npalace itself. Frantic, Jasnah seized this sphere and forced her power into it.\nHer mind blurring, she gave this bead everything she had, and then\ncommanded it to rise.\nBeads shifted.\nA great crashing sounded as beads met one another, clicking, cracking,\nrattling. It was almost like the sound of a wave breaking on rocks. Jasnah\nsurged up from the depths, something solid moving beneath her, obeying\nher command. Beads battered her head, shoulders, arms, until finally she\nexploded from the surface of the sea of glass, hurling a spray of beads into a\ndark sky.\nShe knelt on a platform of glass made up of small beads locked\ntogether. She held her hand to the side, uplifted, clutching the sphere that\nwas the guide. Others rolled around her, forming into the shape of a hallway\nwith lanterns on the walls, an intersection ahead. It didn’t look right, of\ncourse—the entire thing was made of beads. But it was a fair\napproximation.\nShe wasn’t strong enough to form the entire palace. She created only\nthis hallway, without even a roof—but the floor supported her, kept her\nfrom sinking. She opened her mouth with a groan, beads falling out to clack\nagainst the floor. Then she coughed, drawing in sweet breaths, sweat\ntrickling down the sides of her face and collecting on her chin.\nAhead of her, the dark figure stepped up onto the platform. He again\nslid his sword from his sheath.\nJasnah held up a second bead, the statue she’d sensed earlier. She gave\nit power, and other beads collected before her, taking the shape of one of the\nstatues that lined the front of the feast hall—the statue of Talenelat’Elin,\nHerald of War. A tall, muscular man with a large Shardblade.\nIt was not alive, but she made it move, lowering its sword of beads. She\ndoubted it could fight. Round beads could not form a sharp sword. Yet the\nthreat made the dark figure hesitate.\nGritting her teeth, Jasnah heaved herself to her feet, beads streaming\nfrom her clothing. She would not kneel before this thing, whatever it was.\nShe stepped up beside the bead statue, noting for the first time the strange\nclouds overhead. They seemed to form a narrow ribbon of highway, straight\nand long, pointing toward the horizon.\nShe met the oil figure’s gaze.

It regarded her for a moment, then raised\ntwo fingers to its forehead and bowed, as if in respect, a cloak flourishing\nout behind. Others had gathered beyond it, and they turned to each other,\nexchanging hushed whispers.\nThe place of beads faded, and Jasnah found herself back in the hallway\nof the palace. The real one, with real stone, though it had gone dark—the\nStormlight dead in the lamps on the walls. The only illumination came from\nfar down the corridor.\nShe pressed back against the wall, breathing deeply. I, she thought, need\nto write this experience down.\nShe would do so, then analyze and consider. Later. Now, she wanted to\nbe away from this place. She hurried away, with no concern for her\ndirection, trying to escape those eyes she still felt watching.\nIt didn’t work.\nEventually, she composed herself and wiped the sweat from her face\nwith a kerchief. Shadesmar, she thought. That is what it is called in the\nnursery tales. Shadesmar, the mythological kingdom of the spren.\nMythology she’d never believed. Surely she could find something if she\nsearched the histories well enough. Nearly everything that happened had\nhappened before. The grand lesson of history, and…\nStorms! Her appointment.\nCursing to herself, she hurried on her way. That experience continued to\ndistract her, but she needed to make her meeting. So she continued down\ntwo floors, getting farther from the sounds of the thrumming Parshendi\ndrums until she could hear only the sharpest cracks of their beats.\nThat music’s complexity had always surprised her, suggesting that the\nParshendi were not the uncultured savages many took them for. This far\naway, the music sounded disturbingly like the beads from the dark place,\nrattling against one another.\nShe’d intentionally chosen this out-of-the-way section of the palace for\nher meeting with Liss. Nobody ever visited this set of guest rooms. A man\nthat Jasnah didn’t know lounged here, outside the proper door. That relieved\nher. The man would be Liss’s new servant, and his presence meant Liss\nhadn’t left, despite Jasnah’s tardiness. Composing herself, she nodded to the\nguard—a Veden brute with red speckling his beard—and pushed into the\nroom.\nLiss stood from the table inside the small chamber. She wore a maid’s\ndress—low cut, of course—and could have been Alethi. Or Veden. Or Bav.\nDepending on which part of her accent she chose to emphasize. Long dark\nhair, worn loose, and a plump, attractive figure made her distinctive in all\nthe right ways.\n“You’re late, Brightness,” Liss said.\nJasnah gave no reply. She was the employer here, and was not required\nto give excuses. Instead, she laid something on the table beside Liss. A\nsmall envelope, sealed with weevilwax.\nJasnah set two fingers on it, considering.\nNo. This was too brash. She didn’t know if her father realized what she\nwas doing, but even if he hadn’t, too much was happening in this palace.\nShe did not want to commit to an assassination until she was more certain."

She slid a second envelope\nfrom the safepouch inside her sleeve and set it on the table in place of the\nfirst. She removed her fingers from it, rounding the table and sitting down.\nLiss sat back down and made the letter vanish into the bust of her dress.\n“An odd night, Brightness,” the woman said, “to be engaging in treason.”\n“I am hiring you to watch only.”\n“Pardon, Brightness. But one does not commonly hire an assassin to\nwatch. Only.”\n“You have instructions in the envelope,” Jasnah said. “Along with initial\npayment. I chose you because you are expert at extended observations. It is\nwhat I want. For now.”\nLiss smiled, but nodded. “Spying on the wife of the heir to the throne?\nIt will be more expensive this way. You sure you don’t simply want her\ndead?”\nJasnah drummed her fingers on the table, then realized she was doing it\nto the beat of the drums above. The music was so unexpectedly complex—\nprecisely like the Parshendi themselves.\nToo much is happening, she thought. I need to be very careful. Very\nsubtle.\n“I accept the cost,” Jasnah replied. “In one week’s time, I will arrange\nfor one of my sister-in-law’s maids to be released. You will apply for the\nposition, using faked credentials I assume you are capable of producing.\nYou will be hired.\n“From there, you watch and report. I will tell you if your other services\nare needed. You move only if I say. Understood?”\n“You’re the one payin’,” Liss said, a faint Bav dialect showing through.\nIf it showed, it was only because she wished it. Liss was the most\nskilled assassin Jasnah knew. People called her the Weeper, as she gouged\nout the eyes of the targets she killed. Although she hadn’t coined the\ncognomen, it served her purpose well, since she had secrets to hide. For one\nthing, nobody knew that the Weeper was a woman.\nIt was said the Weeper gouged the eyes out to proclaim indifference to\nwhether her victims were lighteyed or dark. The truth was that the action\nhid a second secret—Liss didn’t want anyone to know that the way she\nkilled left corpses with burned-out sockets.\n“Our meeting is done, then,” Liss said, standing.\nJasnah nodded absently, mind again on her bizarre interaction with the\nspren earlier. That glistening skin, colors dancing across a surface the color\nof tar…\nShe forced her mind away from that moment. She needed to devote her\nattention to the task at hand. For now, that was Liss.\nLiss hesitated at the door before leaving. “Do you know why I like you,\nBrightness?”\n“I suspect that it has something to do with my pockets and their\nproverbial depth.”\nLiss smiled. “There’s that, ain’t going to deny it, but you’re also\ndifferent from other lighteyes. When others hire me, they turn up their noses\nat the entire process. They’re all too eager to use my services, but sneer and"

They’re all too eager to use my services, but sneer and\nwring their hands, as if they hate being forced to do something utterly\ndistasteful.”\n“Assassination is distasteful, Liss. So is cleaning out chamber pots. I\ncan respect the one employed for such jobs without admiring the job itself.”\nLiss grinned, then cracked the door.\n“That new servant of yours outside,” Jasnah said. “Didn’t you say you\nwanted to show him off for me?”\n“Talak?” Liss said, glancing at the Veden man. “Oh, you mean that\nother one. No, Brightness, I sold that one to a slaver a few weeks ago.” Liss\ngrimaced.\n“Really? I thought you said he was the best servant you’d ever had.”\n“Too good a servant,” Liss said. “Let’s leave it at that. Storming creepy,\nthat Shin fellow was.” Liss shivered visibly, then slipped out the door.\n“Remember our first agreement,” Jasnah said after her.\n“Always there in the back o’ my mind, Brightness.” Liss closed the\ndoor.\nJasnah settled in her seat, lacing her fingers in front of her. Their “first\nagreement” was that if anyone should come to Liss and offer a contract on a\nmember of Jasnah’s family, Liss would let Jasnah match the offer in\nexchange for the name of the one who made it.\nLiss would do it. Probably. So would the dozen other assassins Jasnah\ndealt with. A repeat customer was always more valuable than a one-off\ncontract, and it was in the best interests of a woman like Liss to have a\nfriend in the government. Jasnah’s family was safe from the likes of these.\nUnless she herself employed the assassins, of course.\nJasnah let out a deep sigh, then rose, trying to shrug off the weight she\nfelt bearing her down.\nWait. Did Liss say her old servant was Shin?\nIt was probably a coincidence. Shin people weren’t plentiful in the East,\nbut you did see them on occasion. Still, Liss mentioning a Shin man and\nJasnah seeing one among the Parshendi… well, there was no harm in\nchecking, even if it meant returning to the feast. Something was off about\nthis night, and not just because of her shadow and the spren.\nJasnah left the small chamber in the bowels of the palace and strode out\ninto the hallway. She turned her steps upward. Above, the drums cut off\nabruptly, like an instrument’s strings suddenly cut. Was the party ending so\nearly? Dalinar hadn’t done something to offend the celebrants, had he? That\nman and his wine…\nWell, the Parshendi had ignored his offenses in the past, so they\nprobably would again. In truth, Jasnah was happy for her father’s sudden\nfocus on a treaty. It meant she would have a chance to study Parshendi\ntraditions and histories at her leisure.\nCould it be, she wondered, that scholars have been searching in the\nwrong ruins all these years?\nWords echoed in the hallway, coming from up ahead. “I’m worried\nabout Ash.”\n“You’re worried about everything.”"

Am I getting worse? I think I feel worse.”\n“Shut up.”\n“I don’t like this. What we’ve done was wrong. That creature carries my\nlord’s own Blade. We shouldn’t have let him keep it. He—”\nThe two passed through the intersection ahead of Jasnah. They were\nambassadors from the West, including the Azish man with the white\nbirthmark on his cheek. Or was it a scar? The shorter of the two men—he\ncould have been Alethi—cut off when he noticed Jasnah. He let out a\nsqueak, then hurried on his way.\nThe Azish man, the one dressed in black and silver, stopped and looked\nher up and down. He frowned.\n“Is the feast over already?” Jasnah asked down the hallway. Her brother\nhad invited these two to the celebration along with every other ranking\nforeign dignitary in Kholinar.\n“Yes,” the man said.\nHis stare made her uncomfortable. She walked forward anyway. I\nshould check further into these two, she thought. She’d investigated their\nbackgrounds, of course, and found nothing of note. Had they been talking\nabout a Shardblade?\n“Come on!” the shorter man said, returning and taking the taller man by\nthe arm.\nHe allowed himself to be pulled away. Jasnah walked to where the\ncorridors crossed, then watched them go.\nWhere once drums had sounded, screams suddenly rose.\nOh no…\nJasnah turned with alarm, then grabbed her skirt and ran as hard as she\ncould.\nA dozen different potential disasters raced through her mind. What else\ncould happen on this broken night, when shadows stood up and her father\nlooked upon her with suspicion? Nerves stretched thin, she reached the\nsteps and started climbing.\nIt took her far too long. She could hear the screams as she climbed and\nfinally emerged into chaos. Dead bodies in one direction, a demolished wall\nin the other. How…\nThe destruction led toward her father’s rooms.\nThe entire palace shook, and a crunch echoed from that direction.\nNo, no, no!\nShe passed Shardblade cuts on the stone walls as she ran.\nPlease.\nCorpses with burned eyes. Bodies littered the floor like discarded bones\nat the dinner table.\nNot this.\nA broken doorway. Her father’s quarters. Jasnah stopped in the hallway,\ngasping.\nControl yourself, control…\nShe couldn’t. Not now. Frantic, she ran into the quarters, though a\nShardbearer would kill her with ease. She wasn’t thinking straight. She\nshould get someone who could help. Dalinar? He’d be drunk. Sadeas, then.\nThe room looked like it had been hit by a highstorm. Furniture in a\nshambles, splinters everywhere. The balcony doors were broken outward.\nSomeone lurched toward them, a man in her father’s Shardplate. Tearim,\nthe bodyguard?\nNo. The helm was broken. It was not Tearim, but Gavilar. Someone on\nthe balcony screamed."

Someone on\nthe balcony screamed.\n“Father!” Jasnah shouted.\nGavilar hesitated as he stepped out onto the balcony, looking back at\nher.\nThe balcony broke beneath him.\nJasnah screamed, dashing through the room to the broken balcony,\nfalling to her knees at the edge. Wind tugged locks of hair loose from her\nbun as she watched two men fall.\nHer father, and the Shin man in white from the feast.\nThe Shin man glowed with a white light. He fell onto the wall. He hit it,\nrolling, then came to a stop. He stood up, somehow remaining on the outer\npalace wall and not falling. It defied reason.\nHe turned, then stalked toward her father.\nJasnah watched, growing cold, helpless as the assassin stepped down to\nher father and knelt over him.\nTears fell from her chin, and the wind caught them. What was he doing\ndown there? She couldn’t make it out.\nWhen the assassin walked away, he left behind her father’s corpse.\nImpaled on a length of wood. He was dead—indeed, his Shardblade had\nappeared beside him, as they all did when their Bearers died.\n“I worked so hard…” Jasnah whispered, numb. “Everything I did to\nprotect this family…”\nHow? Liss. Liss had done this!\nNo. Jasnah wasn’t thinking straight. That Shin man… she wouldn’t\nhave admitted to owning him in such a case. She’d sold him.\n“We are sorry for your loss.”\nJasnah spun, blinking bleary eyes. Three Parshendi, including Klade,\nstood in the doorway in their distinctive clothing. Neatly stitched cloth\nwraps for both men and women, sashes at the waist, loose shirts with no\nsleeves. Hanging vests, open at the sides, woven in bright colors. They\ndidn’t segregate clothing by gender. She thought they did by caste,\nhowever, and—\nStop it, she thought at herself. Stop thinking like a scholar for one\nstorming day!\n“We take responsibility for his death,” said the foremost Parshendi.\nGangnah was female, though with the Parshendi, the gender differences\nseemed minimal. The clothing hid breasts and hips, neither of which were\never very pronounced. Fortunately, the lack of a beard was a clear\nindication. All the Parshendi men she’d ever seen had beards, which they\nwore tied with bits of gemstone, and—\nSTOP IT.\n“What did you say?” Jasnah demanded, forcing herself to her feet.\n“Why would it be your fault, Gangnah?”\n“Because we hired the assassin,” the Parshendi woman said in her\nheavily accented singsong voice. “We killed your father, Jasnah Kholin.”\n“You…”\nEmotion suddenly ran cold, like a river freezing in the heights. Jasnah\nlooked from Gangnah to Klade, to Varnali. Elders, all three of them.\nMembers of the Parshendi ruling council.\n“Why?” Jasnah whispered.\n“Because it had to be done,” Gangnah said."

        "text": "Members of the Parshendi ruling council.\n“Why?” Jasnah whispered.\n“Because it had to be done,” Gangnah said.\n“Why?” Jasnah demanded, stalking forward. “He fought for you! He\nkept the predators at bay! My father wanted peace, you monsters! Why\nwould you betray us now, of all times?”\nGangnah drew her lips to a line. The song of her voice changed. She\nseemed almost like a mother, explaining something very difficult to a small\nchild. “Because your father was about to do something very dangerous.”\n“Send for Brightlord Dalinar!” a voice outside in the hall shouted.\n“Storms! Did my orders get to Elhokar? The crown prince must be taken to\nsafety!” Highprince Sadeas stumbled into the room along with a team of\nsoldiers. His bulbous, ruddy face was wet with sweat, and he wore\nGavilar’s clothing, the regal robes of office. “What are the savages doing\nhere? Storms! Protect Princess Jasnah. The one who did this—he was in\ntheir retinue!”\nThe soldiers moved to surround the Parshendi. Jasnah ignored them,\nturning and stepping back to the broken doorway, hand on the wall, looking\ndown at her father splayed on the rocks below, Blade beside him.\n“There will be war,” she whispered. “And I will not stand in its way.”\n“This is understood,” Gangnah said from behind.\n“The assassin,” Jasnah said. “He walked on the wall.”\nGangnah said nothing.\nIn the shattering of her world, Jasnah caught hold of this fragment. She\nhad seen something tonight. Something that should not have been possible.\nDid it relate to the strange spren? Her experience in that place of glass\nbeads and a dark sky?\nThese questions became her lifeline for stability. Sadeas demanded\nanswers from the Parshendi leaders. He received none. When he stepped up\nbeside her and saw the wreckage below, he went barreling off, shouting for\nhis guards and running down below to reach the fallen king.\nHours later, it was discovered that the assassination—and the surrender\nof three of the Parshendi leaders—had covered the flight of the larger\nportion of their number. They escaped the city quickly, and the cavalry\nDalinar sent after them were destroyed. A hundred horses, each nearly\npriceless, lost along with their riders.\nThe Parshendi leaders said nothing more and gave no clues, even when\nthey were strung up, hanged for their crimes.\nJasnah ignored all that. Instead, she interrogated the surviving guards on\nwhat they had seen. She followed leads about the now-famous assassin’s\nnature, prying information from Liss. She got almost nothing. Liss had\nowned him only a short time, and claimed she hadn’t known about his\nstrange powers. Jasnah couldn’t find the previous owner.\nNext came the books. A dedicated, frenzied effort to distract her from\nwhat she had lost.\nThat night, Jasnah had seen the impossible.\nShe would learn what it meant.\nPart One: Alight\n1.

        "text": "Part One: Alight\n1. Santhid\nTo be perfectly frank, what has happened these\nlast two months is upon my head. The death,\ndestruction, loss, and pain are my burden. I should\nhave seen it coming. And I should have stopped it.\nFrom the personal journal of Navani\nKholin, Jeseses 1174\nShallan pinched the thin charcoal pencil and drew a series of straight\nlines radiating from a sphere on the horizon. That sphere wasn’t quite the\nsun, nor was it one of the moons. Clouds outlined in charcoal seemed to\nstream toward it. And the sea beneath them… A drawing could not convey\nthe bizarre nature of that ocean, made not of water but of small beads of\ntranslucent glass.\nShallan shivered, remembering that place. Jasnah knew much more of it\nthan she would speak of to her ward, and Shallan wasn’t certain how to ask.\nHow did one demand answers after a betrayal such as Shallan’s? Only a few\ndays had passed since that event, and Shallan still didn’t know exactly how\nher relationship with Jasnah would proceed.\nThe deck rocked as the ship tacked, enormous sails fluttering overhead.\nShallan was forced to grab the railing with her clothed safehand to steady\nherself. Captain Tozbek said that so far, the seas hadn’t been bad for this\npart of Longbrow’s Straits. However, she might have to go below if the\nwaves and motion got much worse.\nShallan exhaled and tried to relax as the ship settled. A chill wind blew,\nand windspren zipped past on invisible air currents. Every time the sea grew\nrough, Shallan remembered that day, that alien ocean of glass beads…\nShe looked down again at what she’d drawn. She had only glimpsed\nthat place, and her sketch was not perfect. It—\nShe frowned. On her paper, a pattern had risen, like an embossing.\nWhat had she done? That pattern was almost as wide as the page, a\nsequence of complex lines with sharp angles and repeated arrowhead\nshapes. Was it an effect of drawing that weird place, the place Jasnah said\nwas named Shadesmar? Shallan hesitantly moved her freehand to feel the\nunnatural ridges on the page.\nThe pattern moved, sliding across the page like an axehound pup under\na bedsheet.\nShallan yelped and leapt from her seat, dropping her sketchpad to the\ndeck. The loose pages slumped to the planks, fluttering and then scattering\nin the wind. Nearby sailors—Thaylen men with long white eyebrows they\ncombed back over their ears—scrambled to help, snatching sheets from the\nair before they could blow overboard.\n“You all right, young miss?” Tozbek asked, looking over from a\nconversation with one of his mates. The short, portly Tozbek wore a wide\nsash and a coat of gold and red matched by the cap on his head. He wore his\neyebrows up and stiffened into a fanned shape above his eyes.\n“I’m well, Captain,” Shallan said. “I was merely spooked.”\nYalb stepped up to her, proffering the pages. “Your accouterments, my\nlady.”\nShallan raised an eyebrow. “Accouterments?”"

        "text": "Yalb stepped up to her, proffering the pages. “Your accouterments, my\nlady.”\nShallan raised an eyebrow. “Accouterments?”\n“Sure,” the young sailor said with a grin. “I’m practicing my fancy\nwords. They help a fellow obtain reasonable feminine companionship. You\nknow—the kind of young lady who doesn’t smell too bad an’ has at least a\nfew teeth left.”\n“Lovely,” Shallan said, taking the sheets back. “Well, depending on\nyour definition of lovely, at least.” She suppressed further quips,\nsuspiciously regarding the stack of pages in her hand. The picture she’d\ndrawn of Shadesmar was on top, no longer bearing the strange embossed\nridges.\n“What happened?” Yalb said. “Did a cremling crawl out from under you\nor something?” As usual, he wore an open-fronted vest and a pair of loose\ntrousers.\n“It was nothing,” Shallan said softly, tucking the pages away into her\nsatchel.\nYalb gave her a little salute—she had no idea why he had taken to doing\nthat—and went back to tying rigging with the other sailors. She soon caught\nbursts of laughter from the men near him, and when she glanced at him,\ngloryspren danced around his head—they took the shape of little spheres of\nlight. He was apparently very proud of the jape he’d just made.\nShe smiled. It was indeed fortunate that Tozbek had been delayed in\nKharbranth. She liked this crew, and was happy that Jasnah had selected\nthem for their voyage. Shallan sat back down on the box that Captain\nTozbek had ordered lashed beside the railing so she could enjoy the sea as\nthey sailed. She had to be wary of the spray, which wasn’t terribly good for\nher sketches, but so long as the seas weren’t rough, the opportunity to watch\nthe waters was worth the trouble.\nThe scout atop the rigging let out a shout. Shallan squinted in the\ndirection he pointed. They were within sight of the distant mainland, sailing\nparallel to it. In fact, they’d docked at port last night to shelter from the\nhighstorm that had blown past. When sailing, you always wanted to be near\nto port—venturing into open seas when a highstorm could surprise you was\nsuicidal.\nThe smear of darkness to the north was the Frostlands, a largely\nuninhabited area along the bottom edge of Roshar. Occasionally, she caught\na glimpse of higher cliffs to the south. Thaylenah, the great island kingdom,\nmade another barrier there. The straits passed between the two.\nThe lookout had spotted something in the waves just north of the ship, a\nbobbing shape that at first appeared to be a large log. No, it was much\nlarger than that, and wider. Shallan stood, squinting, as it drew closer. It\nturned out to be a domed brown-green shell, about the size of three\nrowboats lashed together. As they passed by, the shell came up alongside\nthe ship and somehow managed to keep pace, sticking up out of the water\nperhaps six or eight feet.\nA santhid! Shallan leaned out over the rail, looking down as the sailors\njabbered excitedly, several joining her in craning out to see the creature."

Shallan leaned out over the rail, looking down as the sailors\njabbered excitedly, several joining her in craning out to see the creature.\nSanthidyn were so reclusive that some of her books claimed they were\nextinct and all modern reports of them untrustworthy.\n“You are good luck, young miss!” Yalb said to her with a laugh as he\npassed by with rope. “We ain’t seen a santhid in years.”\n“You still aren’t seeing one,” Shallan said. “Only the top of its shell.” To\nher disappointment, waters hid anything else—save shadows of something\nin the depths that might have been long arms extending downward. Stories\nclaimed the beasts would sometimes follow ships for days, waiting out in\nthe sea as the vessel went into port, then following them again once the ship\nleft.\n“The shell is all you ever see of one,” Yalb said. “Passions, this is a\ngood sign!”\nShallan clutched her satchel. She took a Memory of the creature down\nthere beside the ship by closing her eyes, fixing the image of it in her head\nso she could draw it with precision.\nDraw what, though? she thought. A lump in the water?\nAn idea started to form in her head. She spoke it aloud before she could\nthink better. “Bring me that rope,” she said, turning to Yalb.\n“Brightness?” he asked, stopping in place.\n“Tie a loop in one end,” she said, hurriedly setting her satchel on her\nseat. “I need to get a look at the santhid. I’ve never actually put my head\nunderwater in the ocean. Will the salt make it difficult to see?”\n“Underwater?” Yalb said, voice squeaking.\n“You’re not tying the rope.”\n“Because I’m not a storming fool! Captain will have my head if…”\n“Get a friend,” Shallan said, ignoring him and taking the rope to tie one\nend into a small loop. “You’re going to lower me down over the side, and\nI’m going to get a glimpse of what’s under the shell. Do you realize that\nnobody has ever produced a drawing of a live santhid? All the ones that\nhave washed up on beaches were badly decomposed. And since sailors\nconsider hunting the things to be bad luck—”\n“It is!” Yalb said, voice growing more high pitched. “Ain’t nobody\ngoing to kill one.”\nShallan finished the loop and hurried to the side of the ship, her red hair\nwhipping around her face as she leaned out over the rail. The santhid was\nstill there. How did it keep up? She could see no fins.\nShe looked back at Yalb, who held the rope, grinning. “Ah, Brightness.\nIs this payback for what I said about your backside to Beznk? That was just\nin jest, but you got me good! I…” He trailed off as she met his eyes.\n“Storms. You’re serious.”\n“I’ll not have another opportunity like this.

I don’t know what kind of view I can get\nthrough the water, but I have to try.”\nYalb sighed. “We have masks. Made from a tortoise shell with glass in\nhollowed-out holes on the front and bladders along the edges to keep the\nwater out. You can duck your head underwater with one on and see. We use\nthem to check over the hull at dock.”\n“Wonderful!”\n“Of course, I’d have to go to the captain to get permission to take\none…”\nShe folded her arms. “Devious of you. Well, get to it.” It was unlikely\nshe’d be able to go through with this without the captain finding out\nanyway.\nYalb grinned. “What happened to you in Kharbranth? Your first trip\nwith us, you were so timid, you looked like you’d faint at the mere thought\nof sailing away from your homeland!”\nShallan hesitated, then found herself blushing. “This is somewhat\nfoolhardy, isn’t it?”\n“Hanging from a moving ship and sticking your head in the water?”\nYalb said. “Yeah. Kind of a little.”\n“Do you think… we could stop the ship?”\nYalb laughed, but went jogging off to speak with the captain, taking her\nquery as an indication she was still determined to go through with her plan.\nAnd she was.\nWhat did happen to me? she wondered.\nThe answer was simple. She’d lost everything. She’d stolen from Jasnah\nKholin, one of the most powerful women in the world—and in so doing had\nnot only lost her chance to study as she’d always dreamed, but had also\ndoomed her brothers and her house. She had failed utterly and miserably.\nAnd she’d pulled through it.\nShe wasn’t unscathed. Her credibility with Jasnah had been severely\nwounded, and she felt that she had all but abandoned her family. But\nsomething about the experience of stealing Jasnah’s Soulcaster—which had\nturned out to be a fake anyway—then nearly being killed by a man she’d\nthought was in love with her…\nWell, she now had a better idea of how bad things could get. It was as\nif… once she had feared the darkness, but now she had stepped into it. She\nhad experienced some of the horrors that awaited her there. Terrible as they\nwere, at least she knew.\nYou always knew, a voice whispered deep inside of her. You grew up\nwith horrors, Shallan. You just won’t let yourself remember them.\n“What is this?” Tozbek asked as he came up, his wife, Ashlv, at his side.\nThe diminutive woman did not speak much; she dressed in a skirt and\nblouse of bright yellow, a headscarf covering all of her hair except the two\nwhite eyebrows, which she had curled down beside her cheeks.\n“Young miss,” Tozbek said, “you want to go swimming? Can’t you wait\nuntil we get into port? I know of some nice areas where the water is not\nnearly so cold.”\n“I won’t be swimming,” Shallan said, blushing further. What would she\nwear to go swimming with men about? Did people really do that? “I need to"

Did people really do that? “I need to\nget a closer look at our companion.” She gestured toward the sea creature.\n“Young miss, you know I can’t allow something so dangerous. Even if\nwe stopped the ship, what if the beast harmed you?”\n“They’re said to be harmless.”\n“They are so rare, can we really know for certain? Besides, there are\nother animals in these seas that could harm you. Redwaters hunt this area\nfor certain, and we might be in shallow enough water for khornaks to be a\nworry.” Tozbek shook his head. “I’m sorry, I just cannot allow it.”\nShallan bit her lip, and found her heart beating traitorously. She wanted\nto push harder, but that decisive look in his eyes made her wilt. “Very well.”\nTozbek smiled broadly. “I’ll take you to see some shells in the port at\nAmydlatn when we stop there, young miss. They have quite a collection!”\nShe didn’t know where that was, but from the jumble of consonants\nsquished together, she assumed it would be on the Thaylen side. Most cities\nwere, this far south. Though Thaylenah was nearly as frigid as the\nFrostlands, people seemed to enjoy living there.\nOf course, Thaylens were all a little off. How else to describe Yalb and\nthe others wearing no shirts despite the chill in the air?\nThey weren’t the ones contemplating a dip in the ocean, Shallan\nreminded herself. She looked over the side of the ship again, watching\nwaves break against the shell of the gentle santhid. What was it? A great-\nshelled beast, like the fearsome chasmfiends of the Shattered Plains? Was it\nmore like a fish under there, or more like a tortoise? The santhidyn were so\nrare—and the occasions when scholars had seen them in person so\ninfrequent—that the theories all contradicted one another.\nShe sighed and opened her satchel, then set to organizing her papers,\nmost of which were practice sketches of the sailors in various poses as they\nworked to maneuver the massive sails overhead, tacking against the wind.\nHer father would never have allowed her to spend a day sitting and\nwatching a bunch of shirtless darkeyes. How much her life had changed in\nsuch a short time.\nShe was working on a sketch of the santhid’s shell when Jasnah stepped\nup onto the deck.\nLike Shallan, Jasnah wore the havah, a Vorin dress of distinctive design.\nThe hemline was down at her feet and the neckline almost at her chin. Some\nof the Thaylens—when they thought she wasn’t listening—referred to the\nclothing as prudish. Shallan disagreed; the havah wasn’t prudish, but\nelegant. Indeed, the silk hugged the body, particularly through the bust—\nand the way the sailors gawked at Jasnah indicated they didn’t find the\ngarment unflattering.\nJasnah was pretty.

Though Jasnah was twice\nShallan’s age, her mature beauty was something to be admired, even\nenvied. Why did the woman have to be so perfect?\nJasnah ignored the eyes of the sailors. It wasn’t that she didn’t notice\nmen. Jasnah noticed everything and everyone. She simply didn’t seem to\ncare, one way or another, how men perceived her.\nNo, that’s not true, Shallan thought as Jasnah walked over. She wouldn’t\ntake the time to do her hair, or put on makeup, if she didn’t care how she\nwas perceived. In that, Jasnah was an enigma. On one hand, she seemed to\nbe a scholar concerned only with her research. On the other hand, she\ncultivated the poise and dignity of a king’s daughter—and, at times, used it\nlike a bludgeon.\n“And here you are,” Jasnah said, walking to Shallan. A spray of water\nfrom the side of the ship chose that moment to fly up and sprinkle her. She\nfrowned at the drops of water beading on her silk clothing, then looked\nback to Shallan and raised her eyebrow. “The ship, you may have noticed,\nhas two very fine cabins that I hired out for us at no small expense.”\n“Yes, but they’re inside.”\n“As rooms usually are.”\n“I’ve spent most of my life inside.”\n“So you will spend much more of it, if you wish to be a scholar.”\nShallan bit her lip, waiting for the order to go below. Curiously, it did\nnot come. Jasnah gestured for Captain Tozbek to approach, and he did so,\ngroveling his way over with cap in hand.\n“Yes, Brightness?” he asked.\n“I should like another of these… seats,” Jasnah said, regarding Shallan’s\nbox.\nTozbek quickly had one of his men lash a second box in place. As she\nwaited for the seat to be ready, Jasnah waved for Shallan to hand over her\nsketches. Jasnah inspected the drawing of the santhid, then looked over the\nside of the ship. “No wonder the sailors were making such a fuss.”\n“Luck, Brightness!” one of the sailors said. “It is a good omen for your\ntrip, don’t you think?”\n“I shall take any fortune provided me, Nanhel Eltorv,” she said. “Thank\nyou for the seat.”\nThe sailor bowed awkwardly before retreating.\n“You think they’re superstitious fools,” Shallan said softly, watching the\nsailor leave.\n“From what I have observed,” Jasnah said, “these sailors are men who\nhave found a purpose in life and now take simple pleasure in it.” Jasnah\nlooked at the next drawing. “Many people make far less out of life. Captain\nTozbek runs a good crew. You were wise in bringing him to my attention.”\nShallan smiled. “You didn’t answer my question.”\n“You didn’t ask a question,” Jasnah said. “These sketches are\ncharacteristically skillful, Shallan, but weren’t you supposed to be\nreading?”\n“I… had trouble concentrating.”"

        "text": "“You didn’t ask a question,” Jasnah said. “These sketches are\ncharacteristically skillful, Shallan, but weren’t you supposed to be\nreading?”\n“I… had trouble concentrating.”\n“So you came up on deck,” Jasnah said, “to sketch pictures of young\nmen working without their shirts on. You expected this to help your\nconcentration?”\nShallan blushed, as Jasnah stopped at one sheet of paper in the stack.\nShallan sat patiently—she’d been well trained in that by her father—until\nJasnah turned it toward her. The picture of Shadesmar, of course.\n“You have respected my command not to peer into this realm again?”\nJasnah asked.\n“Yes, Brightness. That picture was drawn from a memory of my first…\nlapse.”\nJasnah lowered the page. Shallan thought she saw a hint of something in\nthe woman’s expression. Was Jasnah wondering if she could trust Shallan’s\nword?\n“I assume this is what is bothering you?” Jasnah asked.\n“Yes, Brightness.”\n“I suppose I should explain it to you, then.”\n“Really? You would do this?”\n“You needn’t sound so surprised.”\n“It seems like powerful information,” Shallan said. “The way you\nforbade me… I assumed that knowledge of this place was secret, or at least\nnot to be trusted to one of my age.”\nJasnah sniffed. “I’ve found that refusing to explain secrets to young\npeople makes them more prone to get themselves into trouble, not less.\nYour experimentation proves that you’ve already stumbled face-first into all\nof this—as I once did myself, I’ll have you know. I know through painful\nexperience how dangerous Shadesmar can be. If I leave you in ignorance,\nI’ll be to blame if you get yourself killed there.”\n“So you’d have explained about it if I’d asked earlier in our trip?”\n“Probably not,” Jasnah admitted. “I had to see how willing you were to\nobey me. This time.”\nShallan wilted, and suppressed the urge to point out that back when\nshe’d been a studious and obedient ward, Jasnah hadn’t divulged nearly as\nmany secrets as she did now. “So what is it? That… place.”\n“It’s not truly a location,” Jasnah said. “Not as we usually think of them.\nShadesmar is here, all around us, right now. All things exist there in some\nform, as all things exist here.”\nShallan frowned. “I don’t—”\nJasnah held up a finger to quiet her. “All things have three components:\nthe soul, the body, and the mind. That place you saw, Shadesmar, is what\nwe call the Cognitive Realm—the place of the mind.\n“All around us you see the physical world. You can touch it, see it, hear\nit. This is how your physical body experiences the world. Well, Shadesmar\nis the way that your cognitive self—your unconscious self—experiences the\nworld. Through your hidden senses touching that realm, you make intuitive\nleaps in logic and you form hopes. It is likely through those extra senses\nthat you, Shallan, create art.”\nWater splashed on the bow of the ship as it crossed a swell.

        "text": "that you, Shallan, create art.”\nWater splashed on the bow of the ship as it crossed a swell. Shallan\nwiped a drop of salty water from her cheek, trying to think through what\nJasnah had just said. “That made almost no sense whatsoever to me,\nBrightness.”\n“I should hope that it didn’t,” Jasnah said. “I’ve spent six years\nresearching Shadesmar, and I still barely know what to make of it. I shall\nhave to accompany you there several times before you can understand, even\na little, the true significance of the place.”\nJasnah grimaced at the thought. Shallan was always surprised to see\nvisible emotion from her. Emotion was something relatable, something\nhuman—and Shallan’s mental image of Jasnah Kholin was of someone\nalmost divine. It was, upon reflection, an odd way to regard a determined\natheist.\n“Listen to me,” Jasnah said. “My own words betray my ignorance. I told\nyou that Shadesmar wasn’t a place, and yet I call it one in my next breath. I\nspeak of visiting it, though it is all around us. We simply don’t have the\nproper terminology to discuss it. Let me try another tactic.”\nJasnah stood up, and Shallan hastened to follow. They walked along the\nship’s rail, feeling the deck sway beneath their feet. Sailors made way for\nJasnah with quick bows. They regarded her with as much reverence as they\nwould a king. How did she do it? How could she control her surroundings\nwithout seeming to do anything at all?\n“Look down into the waters,” Jasnah said as they reached the bow.\n“What do you see?”\nShallan stopped beside the rail and stared down at the blue waters,\nfoaming as they were broken by the ship’s prow. Here at the bow, she could\nsee a deepness to the swells. An unfathomable expanse that extended not\njust outward, but downward.\n“I see eternity,” Shallan said.\n“Spoken like an artist,” Jasnah said. “This ship sails across depths we\ncannot know. Beneath these waves is a bustling, frantic, unseen world.”\nJasnah leaned forward, gripping the rail with one hand unclothed and\nthe other veiled within the safehand sleeve. She looked outward. Not at the\ndepths, and not at the land distantly peeking over both the northern and\nsouthern horizons. She looked toward the east. Toward the storms.\n“There is an entire world, Shallan,” Jasnah said, “of which our minds\nskim but the surface. A world of deep, profound thought. A world created\nby deep, profound thoughts. When you see Shadesmar, you enter those\ndepths. It is an alien place to us in some ways, but at the same time we\nformed it. With some help.”\n“We did what?”\n“What are spren?” Jasnah asked.\nThe question caught Shallan off guard, but by now she was accustomed\nto challenging questions from Jasnah. She took time to think and consider\nher answer.\n“Nobody knows what spren are,” Shallan said, “though many\nphilosophers have different opinions on—”\n“No,” Jasnah said. “What are they?”\n“I…” Shallan looked up at a pair of windspren spinning through the air"

        "text": "philosophers have different opinions on—”\n“No,” Jasnah said. “What are they?”\n“I…” Shallan looked up at a pair of windspren spinning through the air\nabove. They looked like tiny ribbons of light, glowing softly, dancing\naround one another. “They’re living ideas.”\nJasnah spun on her.\n“What?” Shallan said, jumping. “Am I wrong?”\n“No,” Jasnah said. “You’re right.” The woman narrowed her eyes. “By\nmy best guess, spren are elements of the Cognitive Realm that have leaked\ninto the physical world. They’re concepts that have gained a fragment of\nsentience, perhaps because of human intervention.\n“Think of a man who gets angry often. Think of how his friends and\nfamily might start referring to that anger as a beast, as a thing that possesses\nhim, as something external to him. Humans personify. We speak of the\nwind as if it has a will of its own.\n“Spren are those ideas—the ideas of collective human experience—\nsomehow come alive. Shadesmar is where that first happens, and it is their\nplace. Though we created it, they shaped it. They live there; they rule there,\nwithin their own cities.”\n“Cities?”\n“Yes,” Jasnah said, looking back out over the ocean. She seemed\ntroubled. “Spren are wild in their variety. Some are as clever as humans and\ncreate cities. Others are like fish and simply swim in the currents.”\nShallan nodded. Though in truth she was having trouble grasping any of\nthis, she didn’t want Jasnah to stop talking. This was the sort of knowledge\nthat Shallan needed, the kind of thing she craved. “Does this have to do\nwith what you discovered? About the parshmen, the Voidbringers?”\n“I haven’t been able to determine that yet. The spren are not always\nforthcoming. In some cases, they do not know. In others, they do not trust\nme because of our ancient betrayal.”\nShallan frowned, looking to her teacher. “Betrayal?”\n“They tell me of it,” Jasnah said, “but they won’t say what it was. We\nbroke an oath, and in so doing offended them greatly. I think some of them\nmay have died, though how a concept can die, I do not know.” Jasnah\nturned to Shallan with a solemn expression. “I realize this is overwhelming.\nYou will have to learn this, all of it, if you are to help me. Are you still\nwilling?”\n“Do I have a choice?”\nA smile tugged at the edges of Jasnah’s lips. “I doubt it. You Soulcast on\nyour own, without the aid of a fabrial. You are like me.”\nShallan stared out over the waters. Like Jasnah. What did it mean? Why\n—\nShe froze, blinking. For a moment, she thought she’d seen the same\npattern as before, the one that had made ridges on her sheet of paper. This\ntime it had been in the water, impossibly formed on the surface of a wave.\n“Brightness…” she said, resting her fingers on Jasnah’s arm. “I thought\nI saw something in the water, just now. A pattern of sharp lines, like a\nmaze.”\n“Show me where.”"

A pattern of sharp lines, like a\nmaze.”\n“Show me where.”\n“It was on one of the waves, and we’ve passed it now. But I think I saw\nit earlier, on one of my pages. Does it mean something?”\n“Most certainly. I must admit, Shallan, I find the coincidence of our\nmeeting to be startling. Suspiciously so.”\n“Brightness?”\n“They were involved,” Jasnah said. “They brought you to me. And they\nare still watching you, it appears. So no, Shallan, you no longer have a\nchoice. The old ways are returning, and I don’t see it as a hopeful sign. It’s\nan act of self-preservation. The spren sense impending danger, and so they\nreturn to us. Our attention now must turn to the Shattered Plains and the\nrelics of Urithiru. It will be a long, long time before you return to your\nhomeland.”\nShallan nodded mutely.\n“This worries you,” Jasnah said.\n“Yes, Brightness. My family…”\nShallan felt like a traitor in abandoning her brothers, who had been\ndepending on her for wealth. She’d written to them and explained, without\nmany specifics, that she’d had to return the stolen Soulcaster—and was now\nrequired to help Jasnah with her work.\nBalat’s reply had been positive, after a fashion. He said he was glad at\nleast one of them had escaped the fate that was coming to the house. He\nthought that the rest of them—her three brothers and Balat’s betrothed—\nwere doomed.\nThey might be right. Not only would Father’s debts crush them, but\nthere was the matter of her father’s broken Soulcaster. The group that had\ngiven it to him wanted it back.\nUnfortunately, Shallan was convinced that Jasnah’s quest was of the\nutmost importance. The Voidbringers would soon return—indeed, they were\nnot some distant threat from stories. They lived among men, and had for\ncenturies. The gentle, quiet parshmen who worked as perfect servants and\nslaves were really destroyers.\nStopping the catastrophe of the return of the Voidbringers was a greater\nduty than even protecting her brothers. It was still painful to admit that.\nJasnah studied her. “With regard to your family, Shallan. I have taken\nsome action.”\n“Action?” Shallan said, taking the taller woman’s arm. “You’ve helped\nmy brothers?”\n“After a fashion,” Jasnah said. “Wealth would not truly solve this\nproblem, I suspect, though I have arranged for a small gift to be sent. From\nwhat you’ve said, your family’s problems really stem from two issues. First,\nthe Ghostbloods desire their Soulcaster—which you have broken—to be\nreturned. Second, your house is without allies and deeply in debt.”\nJasnah proffered a sheet of paper. “This,” she continued, “is from a\nconversation I had with my mother via spanreed this morning.”\nShallan traced it with her eyes, noting Jasnah’s explanation of the\nbroken Soulcaster and her request for help.\nThis happens more often than you’d think, Navani had replied.

The\nfailing likely has to do with the alignment of the gem housings. Bring me the\ndevice, and we shall see.\n“My mother,” Jasnah said, “is a renowned artifabrian. I suspect she can\nmake yours function again. We can send it to your brothers, who can return\nit to its owners.”\n“You’d let me do that?” Shallan asked. During their days sailing,\nShallan had cautiously pried for more information about the sect, hoping to\nunderstand her father and his motives. Jasnah claimed to know very little of\nthem beyond the fact that they wanted her research, and were willing to kill\nfor it.\n“I don’t particularly want them having access to such a valuable\ndevice,” Jasnah said. “But I don’t have time to protect your family right\nnow directly. This is a workable solution, assuming your brothers can stall a\nwhile longer. Have them tell the truth, if they must—that you, knowing I\nwas a scholar, came to me and asked me to fix the Soulcaster. Perhaps that\nwill sate them for now.”\n“Thank you, Brightness.” Storms. If she’d just gone to Jasnah in the\nfirst place, after being accepted as her ward, how much easier would it have\nbeen? Shallan looked down at the paper, noticing that the conversation\ncontinued.\nAs for the other matter, Navani wrote, I’m very fond of this suggestion. I\nbelieve I can persuade the boy to at least consider it, as his most recent\naffair ended quite abruptly—as is common with him—earlier in the week.\n“What is this second part?” Shallan asked, looking up from the paper.\n“Sating the Ghostbloods alone will not save your house,” Jasnah said.\n“Your debts are too great, particularly considering your father’s actions in\nalienating so many. I have therefore arranged a powerful alliance for your\nhouse.”\n“Alliance? How?”\nJasnah took a deep breath. She seemed reluctant to explain. “I have\ntaken the initial steps in arranging for you to be betrothed to one of my\ncousins, son of my uncle Dalinar Kholin. The boy’s name is Adolin. He is\nhandsome and well-acquainted with amiable discourse.”\n“Betrothed?” Shallan said. “You’ve promised him my hand?”\n“I have started the process,” Jasnah said, speaking with uncharacteristic\nanxiety. “Though at times he lacks foresight, Adolin has a good heart—as\ngood as that of his father, who may be the best man I have ever known. He\nis considered Alethkar’s most eligible son, and my mother has long wanted\nhim wed.”\n“Betrothed,” Shallan repeated.\n“Yes. Is that distressing?”\n“It’s wonderful!” Shallan exclaimed, grabbing Jasnah’s arm more\ntightly. “So easy. If I’m married to someone so powerful… Storms! Nobody\nwould dare touch us in Jah Keved. It would solve many of our problems.\nBrightness Jasnah, you’re a genius!”\nJasnah relaxed visibly. “Yes, well, it did seem a workable solution. I had"

I had\nwondered, however, if you’d be offended.”\n“Why on the winds would I be offended?”\n“Because of the restriction of freedom implicit in a marriage,” Jasnah\nsaid. “And if not that, because the offer was made without consulting you. I\nhad to see if the possibility was even open first. It has proceeded further\nthan I’d expected, as my mother has seized on the idea. Navani has… a\ntendency toward the overwhelming.”\nShallan had trouble imagining anyone overwhelming Jasnah.\n“Stormfather! You’re worried I’d be offended? Brightness, I spent my entire\nlife locked in my father’s manor—I grew up assuming he’d pick my\nhusband.”\n“But you’re free of your father now.”\n“Yes, and I was so perfectly wise in my own pursuit of relationships,”\nShallan said. “The first man I chose was not only an ardent, but secretly an\nassassin.”\n“It doesn’t bother you at all?” Jasnah said. “The idea of being beholden\nto another, particularly a man?”\n“It’s not like I’m being sold into slavery,” Shallan said with a laugh.\n“No. I suppose not.” Jasnah shook herself, her poise returning. “Well, I\nwill let Navani know you are amenable to the engagement, and we should\nhave a causal in place within the day.”\nA causal—a conditional betrothal, in Vorin terminology. She would be,\nfor all intents and purposes, engaged, but would have no legal footing until\nan official betrothal was signed and verified by the ardents.\n“The boy’s father has said he will not force Adolin into anything,”\nJasnah explained, “though the boy is recently single, as he has managed to\noffend yet another young lady. Regardless, Dalinar would rather you two\nmeet before anything more binding is agreed upon. There have been…\nshifts in the political climate of the Shattered Plains. A great loss to my\nuncle’s army. Another reason for us to hasten to the Plains.”\n“Adolin Kholin,” Shallan said, listening with half an ear. “A duelist. A\nfantastic one. And even a Shardbearer.”\n“Ah, so you were paying attention to your readings about my father and\nfamily.”\n“I was—but I knew about your family before that. The Alethi are the\ncenter of society! Even girls from rural houses know the names of the\nAlethi princes.” And she’d be lying if she denied youthful daydreams of\nmeeting one. “But Brightness, are you certain this match will be wise? I\nmean, I’m hardly the most important of individuals.”\n“Well, yes. The daughter of another highprince might have been\npreferable for Adolin. However, it seems that he has managed to offend\neach and every one of the eligible women of that rank. The boy is, shall we\nsay, somewhat overeager about relationships. Nothing you can’t work\nthrough, I’m sure.”\n“Stormfather,” Shallan said, feeling her legs go weak. “He’s heir to a\nprincedom! He’s in line to the throne of Alethkar itself!”"

He’s in line to the throne of Alethkar itself!”\n“Third in line,” Jasnah said, “behind my brother’s infant son and\nDalinar, my uncle.”\n“Brightness, I have to ask. Why Adolin? Why not the younger son? I—I\nhave nothing to offer Adolin, or the house.”\n“On the contrary,” Jasnah said, “if you are what I think you are, then\nyou will be able to offer him something nobody else can. Something more\nimportant than riches.”\n“What is it you think that I am?” Shallan whispered, meeting the older\nwoman’s eyes, finally asking the question that she hadn’t dared.\n“Right now, you are but a promise,” Jasnah said. “A chrysalis with the\npotential for grandeur inside. When once humans and spren bonded, the\nresults were women who danced in the skies and men who could destroy\nthe stones with a touch.”\n“The Lost Radiants. Traitors to mankind.” She couldn’t absorb it all.\nThe betrothal, Shadesmar and the spren, and this, her mysterious destiny.\nShe’d known. But speaking it…\nShe sank down, heedless of getting her dress wet on the deck, and sat\nwith her back against the bulwark. Jasnah allowed her to compose herself\nbefore, amazingly, sitting down herself. She did so with far more poise,\ntucking her dress underneath her legs as she sat sideways. They both drew\nlooks from the sailors.\n“They’re going to chew me to pieces,” Shallan said. “The Alethi court.\nIt’s the most ferocious in the world.”\nJasnah snorted. “It’s more bluster than storm, Shallan. I will train you.”\n“I’ll never be like you, Brightness. You have power, authority, wealth.\nJust look how the sailors respond to you.”\n“Am I specifically using said power, authority, or wealth right now?”\n“You paid for this trip.”\n“Did you not pay for several trips on this ship?” Jasnah asked. “They\ndid not treat you the same as they do me?”\n“No. Oh, they are fond of me. But I don’t have your weight, Jasnah.”\n“I will assume that did not have implications toward my girth,” Jasnah\nsaid with a hint of a smile. “I understand your argument, Shallan. It is,\nhowever, dead wrong.”\nShallan turned to her. Jasnah sat upon the deck of the ship as if it were a\nthrone, back straight, head up, commanding. Shallan sat with her legs\nagainst her chest, arms around them below the knees. Even the ways they\nsat were different. She was nothing like this woman.\n“There is a secret you must learn, child,” Jasnah said. “A secret that is\neven more important than those relating to Shadesmar and spren. Power is\nan illusion of perception.”\nShallan frowned.\n“Don’t mistake me,” Jasnah continued. “Some kinds of power are real\n—power to command armies, power to Soulcast. These come into play far\nless often than you would think. On an individual basis, in most\ninteractions, this thing we call power—authority—exists only as it is"

This is true, but you have also seen that I do not\noften use it. You say I have authority as the sister of a king. I do. And yet,\nthe men of this ship would treat me exactly the same way if I were a beggar\nwho had convinced them I was the sister to a king. In that case, my\nauthority is not a real thing. It is mere vapors—an illusion. I can create that\nillusion for them, as can you.”\n“I’m not convinced, Brightness.”\n“I know. If you were, you would be doing it already.” Jasnah stood up,\nbrushing off her skirt. “You will tell me if you see that pattern—the one that\nappeared on the waves—again?”\n“Yes, Brightness,” Shallan said, distracted.\n“Then take the rest of the day for your art. I need to consider how to\nbest teach you of Shadesmar.” The older woman retreated, nodding at the\nbows of sailors as she passed and went back down belowdecks.\nShallan rose, then turned and grabbed the railing, one hand to either side\nof the bowsprit. The ocean spread before her, rippling waves, a scent of\ncold freshness. Rhythmic crashing as the sloop pushed through the waves.\nJasnah’s words fought in her mind, like skyeels with only one rat\nbetween them. Spren with cities? Shadesmar, a realm that was here, but\nunseen? Shallan, suddenly betrothed to the single most important bachelor\nin the world?\nShe left the bow, walking along the side of the ship, freehand trailing on\nthe railing. How did the sailors regard her? They smiled, they waved. They\nliked her. Yalb, who hung lazily from the rigging nearby, called to her,\ntelling her that in the next port, there was a statue she had to go visit. “It’s\nthis giant foot, young miss. Just a foot! Never finished the blustering\nstatue…”\nShe smiled to him and continued. Did she want them to look at her as\nthey looked at Jasnah? Always afraid, always worried that they might do\nsomething wrong? Was that power?\nWhen I first sailed from Vedenar, she thought, reaching the place where\nher box had been tied, the captain kept urging me to go home. He saw my\nmission as a fool’s errand.\nTozbek had always acted as if he were doing her a favor in conveying\nher after Jasnah. Should she have had to spend that entire time feeling as if\nshe’d imposed upon him and his crew by hiring them? Yes, he had offered a\ndiscount to her because of her father’s business with him in the past—but\nshe’d still been employing him.\nThe way he’d treated her was probably a thing of Thaylen merchants. If\na captain could make you feel like you were imposing on him, you’d pay\nbetter.

It was like a tiny, mobile island, its\nback overgrown with seaweed, small crystals jutting up from the shell.\nShallan turned and walked toward the stern, where Captain Tozbek\nspoke with one of his mates, pointing at a map covered with glyphs. He\nnodded to her as she approached. “Just a warning, young miss,” he said.\n“The ports will soon grow less accommodating. We’ll be leaving\nLongbrow’s Straits, curving around the eastern edge of the continent,\ntoward New Natanan. There’s nothing of worth between here and the\nShallow Crypts—and even that’s not much of a sight. I wouldn’t send my\nown brother ashore there without guards, and he’s killed seventeen men\nwith his bare hands, he has.”\n“I understand, Captain,” Shallan said. “And thank you. I’ve revised my\nearlier decision. I need you to halt the ship and let me inspect the specimen\nswimming beside us.”\nHe sighed, reaching up and running his fingers along one of his stiff,\nspiked eyebrows—much as other men might play with their mustaches.\n“Brightness, that’s not advisable. Stormfather! If I dropped you in the\nocean…”\n“Then I would be wet,” Shallan said. “It is a state I’ve experienced one\nor two times in my life.”\n“No, I simply cannot allow it. Like I said, we’ll take you to see some\nshells in—”\n“Cannot allow it?” Shallan interrupted. She regarded him with what she\nhoped was a look of puzzlement, hoping he didn’t see how tightly she\nsqueezed her hands closed at her sides. Storms, but she hated confrontation.\n“I wasn’t aware I had made a request you had the power to allow or\ndisallow, Captain. Stop the ship. Lower me down. That is your order.” She\ntried to say it as forcefully as Jasnah would. The woman could make it seem\neasier to resist a full highstorm than to disagree with her.\nTozbek worked his mouth for a moment, no sound coming out, as if his\nbody were trying to continue his earlier objection but his mind had been\ndelayed. “It is my ship…” he finally said.\n“Nothing will be done to your ship,” Shallan said. “Let’s be quick about\nit, Captain. I do not wish to overly delay our arrival in port tonight.”\nShe left him, walking back to her box, heart thumping, hands trembling.\nShe sat down, partially to calm herself.\nTozbek, sounding profoundly annoyed, began calling orders. The sails\nwere lowered, the ship slowed. Shallan breathed out, feeling a fool.\nAnd yet, what Jasnah said worked. The way Shallan acted created\nsomething in the eyes of Tozbek. An illusion? Like the spren themselves,\nperhaps? Fragments of human expectation, given life?\nThe santhid slowed with them. Shallan rose, nervous, as sailors\napproached with rope.

Was it human\nimagination that had given windspren their mischievous spark?\nShe stepped unsteadily into the rope loop as the sailors lowered it down\nbeside her feet, then Yalb handed her the mask he’d told her of.\nJasnah appeared from belowdecks, looking about in confusion. She saw\nShallan standing off the side of the ship, and then cocked an eyebrow.\nShallan shrugged, then gestured to the men to lower her.\nShe refused to let herself feel silly as she inched toward the waters and\nthe reclusive animal bobbing in the waves. The men stopped her a foot or\ntwo above the water, and she put on the mask, held by straps, covering most\nof her face including the nose.\n“Lower!” she shouted up at them.\nShe thought she could feel their reluctance in the lethargic way the rope\ndescended. Her foot hit the water, and a biting cold shot up her leg.\nStormfather! But she didn’t have them stop. She let them lower her farther\nuntil her legs were submerged in the frigid water. Her skirt ballooned out in\na most annoying way, and she actually had to step on the end of it—inside\nthe loop—to prevent it from rising up about her waist and floating on the\nwater’s surface as she submerged.\nShe wrestled with the fabric for a moment, glad the men above couldn’t\nsee her blushing. Once it got wetter, though, it was easier to manage. She\nfinally was able to squat, still holding tightly to the rope, and go down into\nthe water up to her waist.\nThen she ducked her head under the water.\nLight streamed down from the surface in shimmering, radiant columns.\nThere was life here, furious, amazing life. Tiny fish zipped this way and\nthat, picking at the underside of the shell that shaded a majestic creature.\nGnarled like an ancient tree, with rippled and folded skin, the true form of\nthe santhid was a beast with long, drooping blue tendrils, like those of a\njellyfish, only far thicker. Those disappeared down into the depths, trailing\nbehind the beast at a slant.\nThe beast itself was a knotted grey-blue mass underneath the shell. Its\nancient-looking folds surrounded one large eye on her side—presumably, its\ntwin would be on the other side. It seemed ponderous, yet majestic, with\nmighty fins moving like oarsmen.

Though the depths seemed empty, the area\njust around the santhid teemed with life, as did the area under the ship. Tiny\nfish picked at the bottom of the vessel. They’d move between the santhid\nand the ship, sometimes alone, sometimes in waves. Was this why the\ncreature swam up beside a vessel? Something to do with the fish, and their\nrelationship to it?\nShe looked upon the creature, and its eye—as big as her head—rolled\ntoward her, focusing, seeing her. In that moment, Shallan couldn’t feel the\ncold. She couldn’t feel embarrassed. She was looking into a world that, so\nfar as she knew, no scholar had ever visited.\nShe blinked her eyes, taking a Memory of the creature, collecting it for\nlater sketching.\n2. Bridge Four\nOur first clue was the Parshendi. Even weeks\nbefore they abandoned their pursuit of the\ngemhearts, their pattern of fighting changed. They\nlingered on the plateaus after battles, as if waiting\nfor something.\nFrom the personal journal of Navani\nKholin, Jeseses 1174\nBreath.\nA man’s breath was his life. Exhaled, bit by bit, back into the world.\nKaladin breathed deeply, eyes closed, and for a time that was all he could\nhear. His own life. In, out, to the beating of the thunder in his chest.\nBreath. His own little storm.\nOutside, the rain had stopped. Kaladin remained sitting in the darkness.\nWhen kings and wealthy lighteyes died, their bodies weren’t burned like\nthose of common men. Instead, they were Soulcast into statues of stone or\nmetal, forever frozen.\nThe darkeyes’ bodies were burned. They became smoke, to rise toward\nthe heavens and whatever waited there, like a burned prayer.\nBreath. The breath of a lighteyes was no different from that of a\ndarkeyes. No more sweet, no more free. The breath of kings and slaves\nmingled, to be breathed by men again, over and over.\nKaladin stood up and opened his eyes. He’d spent the highstorm in the\ndarkness of this small room alongside Bridge Four’s new barrack. Alone.\nHe walked to the door, but stopped. He rested his fingers on a cloak he\nknew hung from a hook there. In the darkness, he could not make out its\ndeep blue color, nor the Kholin glyph—in the shape of Dalinar’s sigil—on\nthe back.\nIt seemed that every change in his life had been marked by a storm. This\nwas a big one. He shoved open the door and stepped out into the light as a\nfree man.\nHe left the cloak, for now.\nBridge Four cheered him as he emerged. They had gone out to bathe\nand shave in the riddens of the storm, as was their custom. The line was\nalmost done, Rock having shaved each of the men in turn. The large\nHorneater hummed to himself as he worked the razor over Drehy’s balding\nhead. The air smelled wet from the rain, and a washed-out firepit nearby\nwas the only trace of the stew the group had shared the night before."

        "text": "head. The air smelled wet from the rain, and a washed-out firepit nearby\nwas the only trace of the stew the group had shared the night before.\nIn many ways, this place wasn’t so different from the lumberyards his\nmen had recently escaped. The long, rectangular stone barracks were much\nthe same—Soulcast rather than having been built by hand, they looked like\nenormous stone logs. These, however, each had a couple of smaller rooms\non the sides for sergeants, with their own doors that opened to the outside.\nThey’d been painted with the symbols of the platoons using them before;\nKaladin’s men would have to paint over those.\n“Moash,” Kaladin called. “Skar, Teft.”\nThe three jogged toward him, splashing through puddles left by the\nstorm. They wore the clothing of bridgemen: simple trousers cut off at the\nknees, and leather vests over bare chests. Skar was up and mobile despite\nthe wound to his foot, and he tried rather obviously not to limp. For now,\nKaladin didn’t order him to bed rest. The wound wasn’t too bad, and he\nneeded the man.\n“I want to look at what we’ve got,” Kaladin said, leading them away\nfrom the barrack. It would house fifty men along with a half-dozen\nsergeants. More barracks flanked it on either side. Kaladin had been given\nan entire block of them—twenty buildings—to house his new battalion of\nformer bridgemen.\nTwenty buildings. That Dalinar should so easily be able to find a block\nof twenty buildings for the bridgemen bespoke a terrible truth—the cost of\nSadeas’s betrayal. Thousands of men dead. Indeed, female scribes worked\nnear some of the barracks, supervising parshmen who carried out heaps of\nclothing and other personal effects. The possessions of the deceased.\nNot a few of those scribes looked on with red eyes and frazzled\ncomposures. Sadeas had just created thousands of new widows in Dalinar’s\ncamp, and likely as many orphans. If Kaladin had needed another reason to\nhate that man, he found it here, manifest in the suffering of those whose\nhusbands had trusted him on the battlefield.\nIn Kaladin’s eyes, there was no sin greater than the betrayal of one’s\nallies in battle. Except, perhaps, for the betrayal of one’s own men—of\nmurdering them after they risked their lives to protect you. Kaladin felt an\nimmediate flare of anger at thoughts of Amaram and what he’d done. His\nslave brand seemed to burn again on his forehead.\nAmaram and Sadeas. Two men in Kaladin’s life who would, at some\npoint, need to pay for the things they’d done. Preferably, that payment\nwould come with severe interest.\nKaladin continued to walk with Teft, Moash, and Skar. These barracks,\nwhich were slowly being emptied of personal effects, were also crowded\nwith bridgemen. They looked much like the men of Bridge Four—same\nvests and knee-trousers. And yet, in some other ways, they couldn’t have\nlooked less like the men of Bridge Four. Shaggy-haired with beards that\nhadn’t been trimmed in months, they bore hollow eyes that didn’t seem to\nblink often enough. Slumped backs. Expressionless faces."

Expressionless faces.\nEach man among them seemed to sit alone, even when surrounded by\nhis fellows.\n“I remember that feeling,” Skar said softly. The short, wiry man had\nsharp features and silvering hair at the temples, despite being in his early\nthirties. “I don’t want to, but I do.”\n“We’re supposed to turn those into an army?” Moash asked.\n“Kaladin did it to Bridge Four, didn’t he?” Teft asked, wagging a finger\nat Moash. “He’ll do it again.”\n“Transforming a few dozen men is different from doing the same for\nhundreds,” Moash said, kicking aside a fallen branch from the highstorm.\nTall and solid, Moash had a scar on his chin but no slave brand on his\nforehead. He walked straight-backed with his chin up. Save for those dark\nbrown eyes of his, he could have passed for an officer.\nKaladin led the three past barrack after barrack, doing a quick count.\nNearly a thousand men, and though he’d told them yesterday that they were\nnow free—and could return to their old lives if they wished—few seemed\nto want to do anything but sit. Though there had originally been forty bridge\ncrews, many had been slaughtered during the latest assault and others had\nalready been short-manned.\n“We’ll combine them into twenty crews,” Kaladin said, “of about fifty\neach.” Above, Syl fluttered down as a ribbon of light and zipped around\nhim. The men gave no sign of seeing her; she would be invisible to them.\n“We can’t teach each of these thousand personally, not at first. We’ll want to\ntrain the more eager ones among them, then send them back to lead and\ntrain their own teams.”\n“I suppose,” Teft said, scratching his chin. The oldest of the bridgemen,\nhe was one of the few who retained a beard. Most of the others had shaved\ntheirs off as a mark of pride, something to separate the men of Bridge Four\nfrom common slaves. Teft kept his neat for the same reason. It was light\nbrown where it hadn’t gone grey, and he wore it short and square, almost\nlike an ardent’s.\nMoash grimaced, looking at the bridgemen. “You assume some of them\nwill be ‘more eager,’ Kaladin. They all look the same level of despondent to\nme.”\n“Some will still have fight in them,” Kaladin said, continuing on back\ntoward Bridge Four. “The ones who joined us at the fire last night, for a\nstart. Teft, I’ll need you to choose others. Organize and combine crews, then\npick forty men—two from each team—to be trained first. You’ll be in\ncommand of that training. Those forty will be the seed we use to help the\nrest.”\n“I suppose I can do that.”\n“Good. I’ll give you a few men to help.”\n“A few?” Teft asked. “I could use more than a few…”\n“You’ll have to make do with a few,” Kaladin said, stopping on the path\nand turning westward, toward the king’s complex beyond the camp wall.

It\nrose on a hillside overlooking the rest of the warcamps. “Most of us are\ngoing to be needed to keep Dalinar Kholin alive.”\nMoash and the others stopped beside him. Kaladin squinted at the\npalace. It certainly didn’t look grand enough to house a king—out here,\neverything was just stone and more stone.\n“You are willing to trust Dalinar?” Moash asked.\n“He gave up his Shardblade for us,” Kaladin said.\n“He owed it to us,” Skar said with a grunt. “We saved his storming life.”\n“It could have just been posturing,” Moash said, folding his arms.\n“Political games, him and Sadeas trying to manipulate each other.”\nSyl alighted on Kaladin’s shoulder, taking the form of a young woman\nwith a flowing, filmy dress, all blue-white. She held her hands clasped\ntogether as she looked up at the king’s complex, where Dalinar Kholin had\ngone to plan.\nHe’d told Kaladin that he was going to do something that would anger a\nlot of people. I’m going to take away their games…\n“We need to keep that man alive,” Kaladin said, looking back to the\nothers. “I don’t know if I trust him, but he’s the only person on these Plains\nwho has shown even a hint of compassion for bridgemen. If he dies, do you\nwant to guess how long it will take his successor to sell us back to Sadeas?”\nSkar snorted in derision. “I’d like to see them try with a Knight Radiant\nat our head.”\n“I’m not a Radiant.”\n“Fine, whatever,” Skar said. “Whatever you are, it will be tough for\nthem to take us from you.”\n“You think I can fight them all, Skar?” Kaladin said, meeting the older\nman’s eyes. “Dozens of Shardbearers? Tens of thousands of troops? You\nthink one man could do that?”\n“Not one man,” Skar said, stubborn. “You.”\n“I’m not a god, Skar,” Kaladin said. “I can’t hold back the weight of ten\narmies.” He turned to the other two. “We decided to stay here on the\nShattered Plains. Why?”\n“What good would it do to run?” Teft asked, shrugging. “Even as free\nmen, we’d just end up conscripted into one army or another out there in the\nhills. Either that, or we’d end up starving.”\nMoash nodded. “This is as good a place as any, so long as we’re free.”\n“Dalinar Kholin is our best hope for a real life,” Kaladin said.\n“Bodyguards, not conscripted labor. Free men, despite the brands on our\nforeheads. Nobody else will give us that. If we want freedom, we need to\nkeep Dalinar Kholin alive.”\n“And the Assassin in White?” Skar asked softly.\nThey’d heard of what the man was doing around the world, slaughtering\nkings and highprinces in all nations.

        "text": "“And the Assassin in White?” Skar asked softly.\nThey’d heard of what the man was doing around the world, slaughtering\nkings and highprinces in all nations. The news was the buzz of the\nwarcamps, ever since reports had started trickling in through spanreed. The\nemperor of Azir, dead. Jah Keved in turmoil. A half-dozen other nations left\nwithout a ruler.\n“He already killed our king,” Kaladin said. “Old Gavilar was the\nassassin’s first murder. We’ll just have to hope he’s done here. Either way,\nwe protect Dalinar. At all costs.”\nThey nodded one by one, though those nods were grudging. He didn’t\nblame them. Trusting lighteyes hadn’t gotten them far—even Moash, who\nhad once spoken well of Dalinar, now seemed to have lost his fondness for\nthe man. Or any lighteyes.\nIn truth, Kaladin was a little surprised at himself and the trust he felt.\nBut, storm it, Syl liked Dalinar. That carried weight.\n“We’re weak right now,” Kaladin said, lowering his voice. “But if we\nplay along with this for a time, protecting Kholin, we’ll be paid\nhandsomely. I’ll be able to train you—really train you—as soldiers and\nofficers. Beyond that, we’ll be able to teach these others.\n“We could never make it on our own out there as two dozen former\nbridgemen. But what if we were instead a highly skilled mercenary force of\na thousand soldiers, equipped with the finest gear in the warcamps? If worst\ncomes to worst, and we have to abandon the camps, I’d like to do so as a\ncohesive unit, hardened and impossible to ignore. Give me a year with this\nthousand, and I can have it done.”\n“Now that plan I like,” Moash said. “Do I get to learn to use a sword?”\n“We’re still darkeyes, Moash.”\n“Not you,” Skar said from his other side. “I saw your eyes during the\n—”\n“Stop!” Kaladin said. He took a deep breath. “Just stop. No more talk of\nthat.”\nSkar fell silent.\n“I am going to name you officers,” Kaladin said to them. “You three,\nalong with Sigzil and Rock. You’ll be lieutenants.”\n“Darkeyed lieutenants?” Skar said. The rank was commonly used for\nthe equivalent of sergeants in companies made up only of lighteyes.\n“Dalinar made me a captain,” Kaladin said. “The highest rank he said\nhe dared commission a darkeyes. Well, I need to come up with a full\ncommand structure for a thousand men, and we’re going to need something\nbetween sergeant and captain. That means appointing you five as\nlieutenants. I think Dalinar will let me get away with it. We’ll make master\nsergeants if we need another rank.\n“Rock is going to be quartermaster and in charge of food for the\nthousand. I’ll appoint Lopen his second. Teft, you’ll be in charge of\ntraining. Sigzil will be our clerk. He’s the only one who can read glyphs.\nMoash and Skar…”\nHe glanced toward the two men.

One short, the other tall, they walked\nthe same way, with a smooth gait, dangerous, spears always on their\nshoulders. They were never without. Of all the men he’d trained in Bridge\nFour, only these two had instinctively understood. They were killers.\nLike Kaladin himself.\n“We three,” Kaladin told them, “are each going to focus on watching\nDalinar Kholin. Whenever possible, I want one of us three personally\nguarding him. Often one of the other two will watch his sons, but make no\nmistake, the Blackthorn is the man we’re going to keep alive. At all costs.\nHe is our only guarantee of freedom for Bridge Four.”\nThe others nodded.\n“Good,” Kaladin said. “Let’s go get the rest of the men. It’s time for the\nworld to see you as I do.”\n* * *\nBy common agreement, Hobber sat down to get his tattoo first. The gap-\ntoothed man was one of the very first who had believed in Kaladin. Kaladin\nremembered that day; exhausted after a bridge run, wanting to simply lie\ndown and stare. Instead, he’d chosen to save Hobber rather than letting him\ndie. Kaladin had saved himself that day too.\nThe rest of Bridge Four stood around Hobber in the tent, watching in\nsilence as the tattooist worked carefully on his forehead, covering up the\nscar of his slave’s brand with the glyphs Kaladin had provided. Hobber\nwinced now and then at the pain of the tattoo, but he kept a grin on his face.\nKaladin had heard that you could cover a scar with a tattoo, and it ended\nup working quite well. Once the tattoo ink was injected, the glyphs drew the\neye, and you could barely tell that the skin beneath was scarred.\nOnce the process was finished, the tattooist provided a mirror for\nHobber to look into. The bridgeman touched his forehead hesitantly. The\nskin was red from the needles, but the dark tattoo perfectly covered the\nslave brand.\n“What does it say?” Hobber asked softly, tears in his eyes.\n“Freedom,” Sigzil said before Kaladin could reply. “The glyph means\nfreedom.”\n“The smaller ones above,” Kaladin said, “say the date you were freed\nand the one who freed you. Even if you lose your writ of freedom, anyone\nwho tries to imprison you for being a runaway can easily find proof that\nyou are not. They can go to Dalinar Kholin’s scribes, who keep a copy of\nyour writ.”\nHobber nodded. “That’s good, but it’s not enough. Add ‘Bridge Four’ to\nit. Freedom, Bridge Four.”\n“To imply you were freed from Bridge Four?”\n“No, sir. I wasn’t freed from Bridge Four. I was freed by it. I wouldn’t\ntrade my time there for anything.”\nIt was crazy talk. Bridge Four had been death—scores of men had been\nslaughtered running that cursed bridge. Even after Kaladin had determined\nto save the men, he’d lost far too many. Hobber would have been a fool not\nto take any opportunity to escape."

Hobber would have been a fool not\nto take any opportunity to escape.\nAnd yet, he sat stubbornly until Kaladin drew out the proper glyphs for\nthe tattooist—a calm, sturdy darkeyed woman who looked like she could\nhave lifted a bridge all on her own. She settled down on her stool and began\nadding the two glyphs to Hobber’s forehead, tucked right below the\nfreedom glyph. She spent the process explaining—again—how the tattoo\nwould be sore for days and how Hobber would need to care for it.\nHe accepted the new tattoos with a grin on his face. Pure foolishness,\nbut the others nodded in agreement, clasping Hobber on the arm. Once\nHobber was done, Skar sat quickly, eager, demanding the same full set of\ntattoos.\nKaladin stepped back, folding his arms and shaking his head. Outside\nthe tent, a bustling marketplace sold and bought. The “warcamp” was really\na city, built up inside the craterlike rim of some enormous rock formation.\nThe prolonged war on the Shattered Plains had attracted merchants of all\nvarieties, along with tradesmen, artists, and even families with children.\nMoash stood nearby, face troubled, watching the tattooist. He wasn’t the\nonly one in the bridge crew who didn’t have a slave brand. Teft didn’t\neither. They had been made bridgemen without technically being made\nslaves first. It happened frequently in Sadeas’s camp, where running bridges\nwas a punishment that one could earn for all manner of infractions.\n“If you don’t have a slave’s brand,” Kaladin said loudly to the men,\n“you don’t need to get the tattoo. You’re still one of us.”\n“No,” Rock said. “I will get this thing.” He insisted on sitting down\nafter Skar and getting the tattoo right on his forehead, though he had no\nslave brand. Indeed, every one of the men without a slave brand—Beld and\nTeft included—sat down and got the tattoo on their foreheads.\nOnly Moash abstained, and had the tattoo placed on his upper arm.\nGood. Unlike most of them, he wouldn’t have to go about with a\nproclamation of former slavery in plain view.\nMoash stood up from the seat, and another took his place. A man with\nred and black skin in a marbled pattern, like stone. Bridge Four had a lot of\nvariety, but Shen was in a class all his own. A parshman.\n“I can’t tattoo him,” the artist said. “He’s property.”\nKaladin opened his mouth to object, but the other bridgemen jumped in\nfirst.\n“He’s been freed, like us,” Teft said.\n“One of the team,” Hobber said. “Give him the tattoo, or you won’t see\na sphere from any of us.” He blushed after he said it, glancing at Kaladin—\nwho would be paying for all this, using spheres granted by Dalinar Kholin.\nOther bridgemen spoke out, and the tattoo artist finally sighed and gave\nin. She pulled over her stool and began working on Shen’s forehead.\n“You won’t even be able to see it,” she grumbled, though Sigzil’s skin"

She pulled over her stool and began working on Shen’s forehead.\n“You won’t even be able to see it,” she grumbled, though Sigzil’s skin\nwas nearly as dark as Shen’s, and the tattoo showed up fine on him.\nEventually, Shen looked in the mirror, then stood up. He glanced at\nKaladin, and nodded. Shen didn’t say much, and Kaladin didn’t know what\nto make of the man. It was actually easy to forget about him, usually trailing\nalong silently at the back of the group of bridgemen. Invisible. Parshmen\nwere often that way.\nShen finished, only Kaladin himself remained. He sat down next and\nclosed his eyes. The pain of the needles was a lot sharper than he’d\nanticipated.\nAfter a short time, the tattooist started cursing under her breath.\nKaladin opened his eyes as she wiped a rag on his forehead. “What is\nit?” he asked.\n“The ink won’t take!” she said. “I’ve never seen anything like it. When\nI wipe your forehead, the ink all just comes right off! The tattoo won’t\nstay.”\nKaladin sighed, realizing he had a little Stormlight raging in his veins.\nHe hadn’t even noticed drawing it in, but he seemed to be getting better and\nbetter at holding it. He frequently took in a little these days while walking\nabout. Holding Stormlight was like filling a wineskin—if you filled it to\nbursting and unstopped it, it would squirt out quickly, then slow to a trickle.\nSame with the Light.\nHe banished it, hoping the tattoo artist didn’t notice when he breathed\nout a small cloud of glowing smoke. “Try again,” he said as she got out new\nink.\nThis time, the tattoo took. Kaladin sat through the process, teeth\nclenched against the pain, then looked up as she held the mirror for him.\nThe face that looked back at Kaladin seemed alien. Clean-shaven, hair\npulled back from his face for the tattooing, the slave brands covered up and,\nfor the moment, forgotten.\nCan I be this man again? he thought, reaching up, touching his cheek.\nThis man died, didn’t he?\nSyl landed on his shoulder, joining him in looking into the mirror. “Life\nbefore death, Kaladin,” she whispered.\nHe unconsciously sucked in Stormlight. Just a little, a fraction of a\nsphere’s worth. It flowed through his veins like a wave of pressure, like\nwinds trapped in a small enclosure.\nThe tattoo on his forehead melted. His body shoved out the ink, which\nstarted to drip down his face. The tattooist cursed again and grabbed her\nrag.\nKaladin was left with the image of those glyphs melting away. Freedom\ndissolved, and underneath, the violent scars of his captivity. Dominated by a\nbranded glyph.\nShash. Dangerous.\nThe woman wiped his face. “I don’t know why this is happening! I\nthought it would stay that time. I—”\n“It’s all right,” Kaladin said, taking the rag as he stood, finishing the\ncleanup. He turned to face the rest of them, bridgemen now soldiers. “The\nscars haven’t finished with me yet, it appears. I’ll try again another time.”\nThey nodded.

He’d have to explain to them later what was happening;\nthey knew of his abilities.\n“Let’s go,” Kaladin said to them, tossing a small bag of spheres to the\ntattooist, then taking his spear from beside the tent entrance. The others\njoined him, spears to shoulders. They didn’t need to be armed while in\ncamp, but he wanted them to get used to the idea that they were free to\ncarry weapons now.\nThe market outside was crowded and vibrant. The tents, of course,\nwould have been taken down and stowed during last night’s highstorm, but\nthey’d already sprung up again. Perhaps because he was thinking about\nShen, he noticed the parshmen. He picked out dozens of them with a\ncursory glance, helping set up a few last tents, carrying purchases for\nlighteyes, helping shopowners stack their wares.\nWhat do they think of this war on the Shattered Plains? Kaladin\nwondered. A war to defeat, and perhaps subjugate, the only free parshmen\nin the world?\nWould that he could get an answer out of Shen regarding questions like\nthat. It seemed all he ever got from the parshman were shrugs.\nKaladin led his men through the market, which seemed far friendlier\nthan the one in Sadeas’s camp. Though people stared at the bridgemen,\nnobody sneered, and the haggling at nearby stands—while energetic—\ndidn’t progress to shouting. There even seemed to be fewer urchins and\nbeggars.\nYou just want to believe that, Kaladin thought. You want to believe\nDalinar is the man everyone says he is. The honorable lighteyes of the\nstories. But everyone said the same things about Amaram.\nAs they walked, they did pass some soldiers. Too few. Men who had\nbeen on duty back in the camp when the others had gone on the disastrous\nassault where Sadeas had betrayed Dalinar. As they passed one group\npatrolling the market, Kaladin caught two men at their front raising their\nhands before themselves, crossed at the wrist.\nHow had they learned Bridge Four’s old salute, and so quickly? These\nmen didn’t do it as a full salute, just a small gesture, but they nodded their\nheads to Kaladin and his men as they passed. Suddenly, the more calm\nnature of the market took on another cast to Kaladin. Perhaps this wasn’t\nsimply the order and organization of Dalinar’s army.\nThere was an air of quiet dread over this warcamp. Thousands had been\nlost to Sadeas’s betrayal. Everyone here had probably known a man who\nhad died out on those plateaus. And everyone probably wondered if the\nconflict between the two highprinces would escalate.\n“It’s nice to be seen as a hero, isn’t it?” Sigzil asked, walking beside\nKaladin and watching another group of soldiers pass by.\n“How long will the goodwill last, do you think?” Moash asked. “How\nlong before they resent us?”\n“Ha!” Rock, towering behind him, clapped Moash on the shoulder. “No\ncomplaining today! You do this thing too much. Do not make me kick you.\nI do not like kicking. It hurts my toes.”"

It hurts my toes.”\n“Kick me?” Moash snorted. “You won’t even carry a spear, Rock.”\n“Spears are not for kicking complainers. But big Unkalaki feet like\nmine—it is what they were made for! Ha! This thing is obvious, yes?”\nKaladin led the men out of the market and to a large rectangular\nbuilding near the barracks. This one was constructed of worked stone,\nrather than Soulcast rock, allowing far more finesse in design. Such\nbuildings were becoming more common in the warcamps, as more masons\narrived.\nSoulcasting was quicker, but also more expensive and less flexible. He\ndidn’t know much about it, only that Soulcasters were limited in what they\ncould do. That was why the barracks were all essentially identical.\nKaladin led his men inside the towering building to the counter, where a\ngrizzled man with a belly that stretched to next week supervised a few\nparshmen stacking bolts of blue cloth. Rind, the Kholin head quartermaster,\nto whom Kaladin had sent instructions the night before. Rind was lighteyed,\nbut what was known as a “tenner,” a lowly rank barely above darkeyes.\n“Ah!” Rind said, speaking with a high-pitched voice that did not match\nhis girth. “You’re here, finally! I’ve got them all out for you, Captain.\nEverything I have left.”\n“Left?” Moash asked.\n“Uniforms of the Cobalt Guard! I’ve commissioned some new ones, but\nthis is what stock remained.” Rind grew more subdued. “Didn’t expect to\nneed so many so soon, you see.” He looked Moash up and down, then\nhanded him a uniform and pointed to a stall for changing.\nMoash took it. “We going to wear our leather jerkins over these?”\n“Ha!” Rind said. “The ones tied with so much bone you looked like\nsome Western skullbearer on feast day? I’ve heard of that. But no,\nBrightlord Dalinar says you’re each to be outfitted with breastplates, steel\ncaps, new spears. Chain mail for the battlefield, if you need it.”\n“For now,” Kaladin said, “uniforms will do.”\n“I think I’ll look silly in this,” Moash grumbled, but walked over to\nchange. Rind distributed the uniforms to the men. He gave Shen a strange\nlook, but delivered the parshman a uniform without complaint.\nThe bridgemen gathered in an eager bunch, jabbering with excitement\nas they unfolded their uniforms. It had been a long time since any of them\nhad worn anything other than bridgeman leathers or slave wraps. They\nstopped talking when Moash stepped out.\nThese were newer uniforms, of a more modern style than Kaladin had\nworn in his previous military service. Stiff blue trousers and black boots\npolished to a shine. A buttoned white shirt, only the edges of its collar and\ncuffs extending beyond the jacket, which came down to the waist and\nbuttoned closed beneath the belt.\n“Now, there’s a soldier!” the quartermaster said with a laugh. “Still\nthink you look silly?” He gestured for Moash to inspect his reflection in the"

Kaladin had rarely seen the\nman so out of sorts. “No,” Moash said. “I don’t.”\nThe others moved eagerly and began changing. Some went to the stalls\nat the side, but most didn’t care. They were bridgemen and slaves; they’d\nspent most of their recent lives being paraded about in loincloths or little\nmore.\nTeft had his on before anyone else, and knew to do up the buttons in the\nright places. “Been a long time,” he whispered, buckling his belt. “Don’t\nknow that I deserve to wear something like this again.”\n“This is what you are, Teft,” Kaladin said. “Don’t let the slave rule\nyou.”\nTeft grunted, affixing his combat knife in its place on his belt. “And\nyou, son? When are you going to admit what you are?”\n“I have.”\n“To us. Not to everyone else.”\n“Don’t start this again.”\n“I’ll storming start whatever I want,” Teft snapped. He leaned in,\nspeaking softly. “At least until you give me a real answer. You’re a\nSurgebinder. You’re not a Radiant yet, but you’re going to be one when this\nis all blown through. The others are right to push you. Why don’t you go\nhave a hike up to that Dalinar fellow, suck in some Stormlight, and make\nhim recognize you as a lighteyes?”\nKaladin glanced at the men in a muddled jumble as they tried to get the\nuniforms on, an exasperated Rind explaining to them how to do up the\ncoats.\n“Everything I’ve ever had, Teft,” Kaladin whispered, “the lighteyes\nhave taken from me. My family, my brother, my friends. More. More than\nyou can imagine. They see what I have, and they take it.” He held up his\nhand, and could faintly make out a few glowing wisps trailing from his\nskin, since he knew what to look for. “They’ll take it. If they can find out\nwhat I do, they’ll take it.”\n“Now, how in Kelek’s breath would they do that?”\n“I don’t know,” Kaladin said. “I don’t know, Teft, but I can’t help\nfeeling panic when I think about it. I can’t let them have this, can’t let them\ntake it—or you men—from me. We remain quiet about what I can do. No\nmore talk of it.”\nTeft grumbled as the other men finally got themselves sorted out,\nthough Lopen—one armed, with his empty sleeve turned inside out and\npushed in so it didn’t hang down—prodded at the patch on his shoulder.\n“What’s this?”\n“It’s the insignia of the Cobalt Guard,” Kaladin said. “Dalinar Kholin’s\npersonal bodyguard.”\n“They’re dead, gancho,” Lopen said. “We aren’t them.”\n“Yeah,” Skar agreed.

To Rind’s horror, he got out his knife and cut the\npatch free. “We’re Bridge Four.”\n“Bridge Four was your prison,” Kaladin protested.\n“Doesn’t matter,” Skar said. “We’re Bridge Four.” The others agreed,\ncutting off the patches, tossing them to the ground.\nTeft nodded and did likewise. “We’ll protect the Blackthorn, but we’re\nnot just going to replace what he had before. We’re our own crew.”\nKaladin rubbed his forehead, but this was what he had accomplished in\nbringing them together, galvanizing them into a cohesive unit. “I’ll draw up\na glyphpair insignia for you to use,” he told Rind. “You’ll have to\ncommission new patches.”\nThe portly man sighed as he gathered up the discarded patches. “I\nsuppose. I’ve got your uniform over there, Captain. A darkeyed captain!\nWho would have thought it possible? You’ll be the only one in the army.\nThe only one ever, so far as I know!”\nHe didn’t seem to find it offensive. Kaladin had little experience with\nlow-dahn lighteyes like Rind, though they were very common in the\nwarcamps. In his hometown, there had only been the citylord’s family—of\nupper-middle dahn—and the darkeyes. It hadn’t been until he’d reached\nAmaram’s army that he’d realized there was an entire spectrum of\nlighteyes, many of whom worked common jobs and scrambled for money\njust like ordinary people.\nKaladin walked over to the last bundle on the counter. His uniform was\ndifferent. It included a blue waistcoat and a double-breasted blue longcoat,\nthe lining white, the buttons of silver. The longcoat was meant to hang\nopen, despite the rows of buttons down each side.\nHe’d seen such uniforms frequently. On lighteyes.\n“Bridge Four,” he said, cutting the Cobalt Guard insignia from the\nshoulder and tossing it to the counter with the others.\nShallan’s Sketchbook: Santhid\n3.

Tonight, the\nship did not have a port in which to shelter.\nThe church of this era was suspicious of the Knights Radiant, the book\nread. Yet it relied upon the authority granted Vorinism by the Heralds. This\ncreated a dichotomy in which the Recreance, and the betrayal of the\nknights, was overemphasized. At the same time, the ancient knights—the\nones who had lived alongside the Heralds in the shadowdays—were\ncelebrated.\nThis makes it particularly difficult to study the Radiants and the place\nnamed Shadesmar. What is fact? What records did the church, in its\nmisguided attempt to cleanse the past of perceived contradictions, rewrite\nto suit its preferred narrative? Few documents from the period survive that\ndid not pass through Vorin hands to be copied from the original parchment\ninto modern codices.\nShallan glanced up over the top of her book. The volume was one of\nJasnah’s earliest published works as a full scholar. Jasnah had not assigned\nShallan to read it. Indeed, she’d been hesitant when Shallan had asked for a\ncopy, and had needed to dig it out of one of the numerous trunks full of\nbooks she kept in the ship’s hold.\nWhy had she been so reluctant, when this volume dealt with the very\nthings that Shallan was studying? Shouldn’t Jasnah have given her this right\noff? It—\nThe pattern returned.\nShallan’s breath caught in her throat as she saw it on the cabin wall\nbeside the bunk, just to her left. She carefully moved her eyes back to the\npage in front of her. The pattern was the same one that she’d seen before,\nthe shape that had appeared on her sketchpad.\nEver since then, she’d been seeing it from the corner of her eye,\nappearing in the grain of wood, the cloth on the back of a sailor’s shirt, the\nshimmering of the water. Each time, when she looked right at it, the pattern\nvanished. Jasnah would say nothing more, other than to indicate it was\nlikely harmless.\nShallan turned the page and steadied her breathing. She had experienced\nsomething like this before with the strange symbol-headed creatures who\nhad appeared unbidden in her drawings. She allowed her eyes to slip up off\nthe page and look at the wall—not right at the pattern, but to the side of it,\nas if she hadn’t noticed it.\nYes, it was there. Raised, like an embossing, it had a complex pattern\nwith a haunting symmetry. Its tiny lines twisted and turned through its\nmass, somehow lifting the surface of the wood, like iron scrollwork under a\ntaut tablecloth.\nIt was one of those things. The symbolheads. This pattern was similar to\ntheir strange heads. She looked back at the page, but did not read. The ship\nswayed, and the glowing white spheres in her goblet clinked as they shifted.\nShe took a deep breath.\nThen looked directly at the pattern.\nImmediately, it began to fade, the ridges sinking. Before it did, she got a\nclear look at it, and she took a Memory.\n“Not this time,” she muttered as it vanished. “This time I have you.”"

She huddled down beside her light, red hair\ntumbling around her shoulders.\nShe worked furiously, possessed by a frantic need to have this drawing\ndone. Her fingers moved on their own, her unclothed safehand holding the\nsketchpad toward the goblet, which sprinkled the paper with shards of light.\nShe tossed aside the pencil. She needed something crisper, capable of\nsharper lines. Ink. Pencil was wonderful for drawing the soft shades of life,\nbut this thing she drew was not life. It was something else, something\nunreal. She dug a pen and inkwell from her supplies, then went back to her\ndrawing, replicating the tiny, intricate lines.\nShe did not think as she drew. The art consumed her, and creationspren\npopped into existence all around. Dozens of tiny shapes soon crowded the\nsmall table beside her cot and the floor of the cabin near where she knelt.\nThe spren shifted and spun, each no larger than the bowl of a spoon,\nbecoming shapes they’d recently encountered. She mostly ignored them,\nthough she’d never seen so many at once.\nFaster and faster they shifted forms as she drew, intent. The pattern\nseemed impossible to capture. Its complex repetitions twisted down into\ninfinity. No, a pen could never capture this thing perfectly, but she was\nclose. She drew it spiraling out of a center point, then re-created each\nbranch off the center, which had its own swirl of tiny lines. It was like a\nmaze created to drive its captive insane.\nWhen she finished the last line, she found herself breathing hard, as if\nshe’d run a great distance. She blinked, again noticing the creationspren\naround her—there were hundreds. They lingered before fading away one by\none. Shallan set the pen down beside her vial of ink, which she’d stuck to\nthe tabletop with wax to keep it from sliding as the ship swayed. She picked\nup the page, waiting for the last lines of ink to dry, and felt as if she’d\naccomplished something significant—though she knew not what.\nAs the last line dried, the pattern rose before her. She heard a distinct\nsigh from the paper, as if in relief.\nShe jumped, dropping the paper and scrambling onto her bed. Unlike\nthe other times, the embossing didn’t vanish, though it left the paper—\nbudding from her matching drawing—and moved onto the floor.\nShe could describe it in no other way. The pattern somehow moved\nfrom paper to floor. It came to the leg of her cot and wrapped around it,\nclimbing upward and onto the blanket. It didn’t look like something moving\nbeneath the blanket; that was simply a crude approximation. The lines were\ntoo precise for that, and there was no stretching. Something beneath the\nblanket would have been just an indistinct lump, but this was exact.\nIt drew closer. It didn’t look dangerous, but she still found herself\ntrembling.

A flattened-out version, without torso or\nlimbs. It was an abstraction of one of them, just as a circle with a few lines\nin it could represent a human’s face on the page.\nThose things had terrified her, haunted her dreams, made her worry she\nwas going insane. So as this one approached, she scuttled from her bed and\nwent as far from it in the small cabin as she could. Then, heart thumping in\nher chest, she pulled open the door to go for Jasnah.\nShe found Jasnah herself just outside, reaching toward the doorknob,\nher left hand cupped before her. A small figure made of inky blackness—\nshaped like a man in a smart, fashionable suit with a long coat—stood in\nher palm. He melted away into shadow as he saw Shallan. Jasnah looked to\nShallan, then glanced toward the floor of the cabin, where the pattern was\ncrossing the wood.\n“Put on some clothing, child,” Jasnah said. “We have matters to\ndiscuss.”\n* * *\n“I had originally hoped that we would have the same type of spren,”\nJasnah said, sitting on a stool in Shallan’s cabin. The pattern remained on\nthe floor between her and Shallan, who lay prone on the cot, properly\nclothed with a robe over the nightgown and a thin white glove on her left\nhand. “But of course, that would be too easy. I have suspected since\nKharbranth that we would be of different orders.”\n“Orders, Brightness?” Shallan asked, timidly using a pencil to prod at\nthe pattern on the floor. It shied away, like an animal that had been poked.\nShallan was fascinated by how it raised the surface of the floor, though a\npart of her did not want to have anything to do with it and its unnatural,\neye-twisting geometries.\n“Yes,” Jasnah said. The inklike spren that had accompanied her before\nhad not reappeared. “Each order reportedly had access to two of the Surges,\nwith overlap between them. We call the powers Surgebinding. Soulcasting\nwas one, and is what we share, though our orders are different.”\nShallan nodded. Surgebinding. Soulcasting. These were talents of the\nLost Radiants, the abilities—supposedly just legend—that had been their\nblessing or their curse, depending upon which reports you read. Or so she’d\nlearned from the books Jasnah had given her to read during their trip.\n“I’m not one of the Radiants,” Shallan said.\n“Of course you aren’t,” Jasnah said, “and neither am I. The orders of\nknights were a construct, just as all society is a construct, used by men to\ndefine and explain. Not every man who wields a spear is a soldier, and not\nevery woman who makes bread is a baker. And yet weapons, or baking,\nbecome the hallmarks of certain professions.”\n“So you’re saying that what we can do…”\n“Was once the definition of what initiated one into the Knights\nRadiant,” Jasnah said.\n“But we’re women!”"

Refreshing, wouldn’t you say?”\nShallan looked up from poking at the pattern spren. “There were women\namong the Knights Radiant?”\n“A statistically appropriate number,” Jasnah said. “But don’t fear that\nyou will soon find yourself swinging a sword, child. The archetype of\nRadiants on the battlefield is an exaggeration. From what I’ve read—though\nrecords are, unfortunately, untrustworthy—for every Radiant dedicated to\nbattle, there were another three who spent their time on diplomacy,\nscholarship, or other ways to aid society.”\n“Oh.” Why was Shallan disappointed by that?\nFool. A memory rose unbidden. A silvery sword. A pattern of light.\nTruths she could not face. She banished them, squeezing her eyes shut.\nTen heartbeats.\n“I have been looking into the spren you told me about,” Jasnah said.\n“The creatures with the symbol heads.”\nShallan took a deep breath and opened her eyes. “This is one of them,”\nshe said, pointing her pencil at the pattern, which had approached her trunk\nand was moving up onto it and off it—like a child jumping on a sofa.\nInstead of threatening, it seemed innocent, even playful—and hardly\nintelligent at all. She had been frightened of this thing?\n“Yes, I suspect that it is,” Jasnah said. “Most spren manifest differently\nhere than they do in Shadesmar. What you drew before was their form\nthere.”\n“This one is not very impressive.”\n“Yes. I will admit that I’m disappointed. I feel that we’re missing\nsomething important about this, Shallan, and I find it annoying. The\nCryptics have a fearful reputation, and yet this one—the first specimen I’ve\never seen—seems…”\nIt climbed up the wall, then slipped down, then climbed back up, then\nslipped down again.\n“Imbecilic?” Shallan asked.\n“Perhaps it simply needs more time,” Jasnah said. “When I first bonded\nwith Ivory—” She stopped abruptly.\n“What?” Shallan said.\n“I’m sorry. He does not like me to speak of him. It makes him anxious.\nThe knights’ breaking of their oaths was very painful to the spren. Many\nspren died; I’m certain of it. Though Ivory won’t speak of it, I gather that\nwhat he’s done is regarded as a betrayal by the others of his kind.”\n“But—”\n“No more of that,” Jasnah said. “I’m sorry.”\n“Fine. You mentioned the Cryptics?”\n“Yes,” Jasnah said, reaching into the sleeve that hid her safehand and\nslipping out a folded piece of paper—one of Shallan’s drawings of the\nsymbolheads. “That is their own name for themselves, though we would\nprobably name them liespren. They don’t like the term. Regardless, the\nCryptics rule one of the greater cities in Shadesmar.

Think of them as the\nlighteyes of the Cognitive Realm.”\n“So this thing,” Shallan said, nodding to the pattern, which was\nspinning in circles in the center of the cabin, “is like… a prince, on their\nside?”\n“Something like that. There is a complex sort of conflict between them\nand the honorspren. Spren politics are not something I’ve been able to\ndevote much time to. This spren will be your companion—and will grant\nyou the ability to Soulcast, among other things.”\n“Other things?”\n“We will have to see,” Jasnah said. “It comes down to the nature of\nspren. What has your research revealed?”\nWith Jasnah, everything seemed to be a test of scholarship. Shallan\nsmothered a sigh. This was why she had come with Jasnah, rather than\nreturning to her home. Still, she did wish that sometimes Jasnah would just\ntell her answers rather than making her work so hard to find them. “Alai\nsays that the spren are fragments of the powers of creation. A lot of the\nscholars I read agreed with that.”\n“It is one opinion. What does it mean?”\nShallan tried not to let herself be distracted by the spren on the floor.\n“There are ten fundamental Surges—forces—by which the world works.\nGravitation, pressure, transformation. That sort of thing. You told me spren\nare fragments of the Cognitive Realm that have somehow gained sentience\nbecause of human attention. Well, it stands to reason that they were\nsomething before. Like… like a painting was a canvas before being given\nlife.”\n“Life?” Jasnah said, raising her eyebrow.\n“Of course,” Shallan said. Paintings lived. Not lived like a person or a\nspren, but… well, it was obvious to her, at least. “So, before the spren were\nalive, they were something. Power. Energy. Zen-daughter-Vath sketched\ntiny spren she found sometimes around heavy objects. Gravitationspren—\nfragments of the power or force that causes us to fall. It stands to reason that\nevery spren was a power before it was a spren. Really, you can divide spren\ninto two general groups. Those that respond to emotions and those that\nrespond to forces like fire or wind pressure.”\n“So you believe Namar’s theory on spren categorization?”\n“Yes.”\n“Good,” Jasnah said. “As do I. I suspect, personally, that these\ngroupings of spren—emotion spren versus nature spren—are where the\nideas of mankind’s primeval ‘gods’ came from. Honor, who became\nVorinism’s Almighty, was created by men who wanted a representation of\nideal human emotions as they saw in emotion spren. Cultivation, the god\nworshipped in the West, is a female deity that is an embodiment of nature\nand nature spren. The various Voidspren, with their unseen lord—whose\nname changes depending on which culture we’re speaking of—evoke an\nenemy or antagonist. The Stormfather, of course, is a strange offshoot of\nthis, his theoretical nature changing depending on which era of Vorinism is\ndoing the talking…”\nShe trailed off.

Shallan blushed, realizing she’d looked away and had\nbegun tracing a glyphward on her blanket against the evil in Jasnah’s words.\n“That was a tangent,” Jasnah said. “I apologize.”\n“You’re so sure he isn’t real,” Shallan said. “The Almighty.”\n“I have no more proof of him than I do of the Thaylen Passions, Nu\nRalik of the Purelake, or any other religion.”\n“And the Heralds? You don’t think they existed?”\n“I don’t know,” Jasnah said. “There are many things in this world that I\ndon’t understand. For example, there is some slight proof that both the\nStormfather and the Almighty are real creatures—simply powerful spren,\nsuch as the Nightwatcher.”\n“Then he would be real.”\n“I never claimed he was not,” Jasnah said. “I merely claimed that I do\nnot accept him as God, nor do I feel any inclination to worship him. But this\nis, again, a tangent.” Jasnah stood. “You are relieved of other duties of\nstudy. For the next few days, you have only one focus for your\nscholarship.” She pointed toward the floor.\n“The pattern?” Shallan asked.\n“You are the only person in centuries to have the chance to interact with\na Cryptic,” Jasnah said. “Study it and record your experiences—in detail.\nThis will likely be your first writing of significance, and could be of utmost\nimportance to our future.”\nShallan regarded the pattern, which had moved over and bumped into\nher foot—she could feel it only faintly—and was now bumping into it time\nand time again.\n“Great,” Shallan said.\n4. Taker of Secrets\nThe next clue came on the walls. I did not\nignore this sign, but neither did I grasp its full\nimplications.\nFrom the journal of Navani Kholin,\nJeseses 1174\n“I’m running through water,” Dalinar said, coming to himself. He was\nmoving, charging forward.\nThe vision coalesced around him. Warm water splashed his legs. On\neither side of him, a dozen men with hammers and spears ran through the\nshallow water. They lifted their legs high with each step, feet back, thighs\nlifting parallel to the water’s surface, like they were marching in a parade—\nonly no parade had ever been such a mad scramble. Obviously, running that\nway helped them move through the liquid. He tried to imitate the odd gait.\n“I’m in the Purelake, I think,” he said, under his breath. “Warm water\nthat only comes up to the knees, no signs of land anywhere. It’s dusk,\nthough, so I can’t see much.\n“People run with me. I don’t know if we’re running toward something\nor away from it. Nothing over my shoulder that I can see. These people are\nobviously soldiers, though the uniforms are antiquated. Leather skirts,\nbronze helms and breastplates. Bare legs and arms.” He looked down at\nhimself. “I’m wearing the same.”\nSome highlords in Alethkar and Jah Keved still used uniforms like this,\nso he couldn’t place the exact era.

The modern uses were all calculated\nrevivals by traditionalist commanders who hoped a classical look would\ninspire their men. In those cases, however, modern steel equipment would\nbe used alongside the antique uniforms—and he didn’t see any of that here.\nDalinar didn’t ask questions. He’d found that playing along with these\nvisions taught him more than it did to stop and demand answers.\nRunning through this water was tough. Though he’d started near the\nfront of the group, he was now lagging behind. The group ran toward some\nkind of large rock mound ahead, shadowed in the dusk. Maybe this wasn’t\nthe Purelake. It didn’t have rock formations like—\nThat wasn’t a rock mound. It was a fortress. Dalinar halted, looking up\nat the peaked, castle-like structure that rose straight from the still lake\nwaters. He’d never seen its like before. Jet-black stone. Obsidian? Perhaps\nthis place had been Soulcast.\n“There’s a fortress ahead,” he said, continuing forward. “It must not still\nexist—if it did, it would be famous. It looks like it’s created entirely from\nobsidian. Finlike sides rising toward peaked tips above, towers like\narrowheads… Stormfather. It’s majestic.\n“We’re approaching another group of soldiers who stand in the water,\nholding spears wardingly in all directions. There are perhaps a dozen of\nthem; I’m in the company of another dozen. And… yes, there’s someone in\nthe middle of them. Shardbearer. Glowing armor.”\nNot just a Shardbearer. Radiant. A knight in resplendent Shardplate that\nglowed with a deep red at the joints and in certain markings. Armor did that\nin the shadowdays. This vision was taking place before the Recreance.\nLike all Shardplate, the armor was distinctive. With that skirt of chain\nlinks, those smooth joints, the vambraces that extended back just so…\nStorms, that looked like Adolin’s armor, though this armor pulled in more at\nthe waist. Female? Dalinar couldn’t tell for certain, as the faceplate was\ndown.\n“Form up!” the knight ordered as Dalinar’s group arrived, and he\nnodded to himself. Yes, female.\nDalinar and the other soldiers formed a ring around the knight, weapons\noutward. Not far off, another group of soldiers with a knight at their center\nmarched through the water.\n“Why did you call us back?” asked one of Dalinar’s companions.\n“Caeb thinks he saw something,” the knight said. “Be alert. Let’s move\ncarefully.”\nThe group started away from the fortress in another direction from the\none they’d come. Dalinar held his spear outward, sweating at his temples.\nTo his own eyes, he didn’t look any different from his normal self. The\nothers, however, would see him as one of their own.\nHe still didn’t know terribly much about these visions. The Almighty\nsent them to him, somehow. But the Almighty was dead, by his own\nadmission. So how did that work?\n“We’re looking for something,” Dalinar said, under his breath. “Teams\nof knights and soldiers have been sent into the night to find something that\nwas spotted.”"

So how did that work?\n“We’re looking for something,” Dalinar said, under his breath. “Teams\nof knights and soldiers have been sent into the night to find something that\nwas spotted.”\n“You all right, new kid?” asked one of the soldiers to his side.\n“Fine,” Dalinar said. “Just worried. I mean, I don’t even really know\nwhat we’re looking for.”\n“A spren that doesn’t act like it should,” the man said. “Keep your eyes\nopen. Once Sja-anat touches a spren, it acts strange. Call attention to\nanything you see.”\nDalinar nodded, then under his breath repeated the words, hoping that\nNavani could hear him. He and the soldiers continued their sweep, the\nknight at their center speaking with… nobody? She sounded like she was\nhaving a conversation, but Dalinar couldn’t see or hear anyone else with\nher.\nHe turned his attention to the surroundings. He’d always wanted to see\nthe center of the Purelake, but he’d never had a chance to do much besides\nvisit the border. He’d been unable to find time for a detour in that direction\nduring his last visit to Azir. The Azish had always acted surprised that he\nwould want to go to such a place, as they claimed there was “nothing\nthere.”\nDalinar wore some kind of tight shoes on his feet, perhaps to keep him\nfrom cutting them on anything hidden by the water. The footing was uneven\nin places, with holes and ridges he felt rather than saw. He found himself\nwatching little fish dart this way and that, shadows in the water, and next to\nthem a face.\nA face.\nDalinar shouted, jumping back, pointing his spear downward. “That was\na face! In the water!”\n“Riverspren?” the knight asked, stepping up beside him.\n“It looked like a shadow,” Dalinar said. “Red eyes.”\n“It’s here, then,” the knight said. “Sja-anat’s spy. Caeb, run to the\ncheckpoint. The rest of you, keep watching. It won’t be able to go far\nwithout a carrier.” She yanked something off her belt, a small pouch.\n“There!” Dalinar said, spotting a small red dot in the water. It flowed\naway from him, swimming like a fish. He charged after, running as he’d\nlearned earlier. What good would it do to chase a spren, though? You\ncouldn’t catch them. Not with any method he knew.\nThe others charged behind. Fish scattered away, frightened by Dalinar’s\nsplashing. “I’m chasing a spren,” Dalinar said under his breath. “It’s what\nwe’ve been hunting. It looks a little like a face—a shadowy one, with red\neyes. It swims through the water like a fish. Wait! There’s another one.\nJoining it. Larger, like a full figure, easily six feet. A swimming person, but\nlike a shadow. It—”\n“Storms!” the knight shouted suddenly. “It brought an escort!”\nThe larger spren twisted, then dove downward in the water, vanishing\ninto the rocky ground. Dalinar stopped, uncertain if he should keep chasing\nthe smaller one or remain here.\nThe others turned and started to run the other way.\nUh-oh…\nDalinar scrambled back as the rocky lake bottom began to shake.

He\nstumbled, splashing down into the water. It was so clear he could see the\nfloor cracking under him, as if something large were pounding against it\nfrom beneath.\n“Come on!” one of the soldiers cried, grabbing him by the arm. Dalinar\nwas pulled to his feet as the cracks below widened. The once-still surface of\nthe lake churned and thrashed.\nThe ground jolted, almost tumbling Dalinar off his feet again. Ahead of\nhim, several of the soldiers did fall.\nThe knight stood firm, an enormous Shardblade forming in her hands.\nDalinar glanced over his shoulder in time to see rock emerging from the\nwater. A long arm! Slender, perhaps fifteen feet long, it burst from the\nwater, then slammed back down as if to get a firm purchase on the lakebed.\nAnother arm rose nearby, elbow toward the sky, then they both heaved as if\nattached to a body doing a push-up.\nA giant body ripped itself out of the rocky floor. It was like someone\nhad been buried in sand and was now emerging. Water streamed from the\ncreature’s ridged and pocked back, which was overgrown with bits of\nshalebark and submarine fungus. The spren had somehow animated the\nstone itself.\nAs it stood and twisted about, Dalinar could make out glowing red eyes\n—like molten rock—set deep in an evil stone face. The body was skeletal,\nwith thin bony limbs and spiky fingers that ended in rocky claws. The chest\nwas a rib cage of stone.\n“Thunderclast!” soldiers yelled. “Hammers! Ready hammers!”\nThe knight stood before the rising creature, which stood thirty feet tall,\ndripping water. A calm, white light began to rise from her. It reminded\nDalinar of the light of spheres. Stormlight. She raised her Shardblade and\ncharged, stepping through the water with uncanny ease, as if it had no\npurchase on her. Perhaps it was the strength of Shardplate.\n“They were created to watch,” a voice said from beside him.\nDalinar looked to the soldier who had helped him rise earlier, a long-\nfaced Selay man with a balding scalp and a wide nose. Dalinar reached\ndown to help the man to his feet.\nThis wasn’t how the man had spoken before, but Dalinar recognized the\nvoice. It was the same one that came at the end of most of the visions. The\nAlmighty.\n“The Knights Radiant,” the Almighty said, standing up beside Dalinar,\nwatching the knight attack the nightmare beast. “They were a solution, a\nway to offset the destruction of the Desolations. Ten orders of knights,\nfounded with the purpose of helping men fight, then rebuild.”\nDalinar repeated it, word for word, focused on catching every one and\nnot on thinking about what they meant.\nThe Almighty turned to him. “I was surprised when these orders arrived.\nI did not teach my Heralds this. It was the spren—wishing to imitate what I\nhad given men—who made it possible. You will need to refound them. This\nis your task. Unite them. Create a fortress that can weather the storm. Vex"

Vex\nOdium, convince him that he can lose, and appoint a champion. He will\ntake that chance instead of risking defeat again, as he has suffered so often.\nThis is the best advice I can give you.”\nDalinar finished repeating the words. Beyond him, the fight began in\nearnest, water splashing, rock grinding. Soldiers approached bearing\nhammers, and unexpectedly, these men now also glowed with Stormlight,\nthough far more faintly.\n“You were surprised by the coming of the knights,” Dalinar said to the\nAlmighty. “And this force, this enemy, managed to kill you. You were never\nGod. God knows everything. God cannot be killed. So who were you?”\nThe Almighty did not answer. He couldn’t. Dalinar had realized that\nthese visions were some kind of predetermined experience, like a play. The\npeople in them could react to Dalinar, like actors who could improvise to an\nextent. The Almighty himself never did this.\n“I will do what I can,” Dalinar said. “I will refound them. I will prepare.\nYou have told me many things, but there is one I have figured out on my\nown. If you could be killed, then the other like you—your enemy—\nprobably can be as well.”\nThe darkness came upon Dalinar. The yelling and splashing faded. Had\nthis vision occurred during a Desolation, or between? These visions never\ntold him enough. As the darkness evaporated he found himself lying in a\nsmall stone chamber within his complex in the warcamps.\nNavani knelt beside him, clipboard held before her, pen moving as she\nscribbled. Storms, she was beautiful. Mature, lips painted red, hair wound\nabout her head in a complex braid that sparkled with rubies. Bloodred dress.\nShe looked at him, noting that he was blinking back awake, and smiled.\n“It was—” he began.\n“Hush,” she said, still writing. “That last part sounded important.” She\nwrote for a moment, then finally removed pen from pad, the latter held\nthrough the cloth of her sleeve. “I think I got it all. It’s hard when you\nchange languages.”\n“I changed languages?” he asked.\n“At the end. Before, you were speaking Selay. An ancient form of it,\ncertainly, but we have records of that. I hope my translators can make sense\nof my transcription; my command of that language is rusty. You do need to\nspeak more slowly when you do this, dearest.”\n“That can be hard, in the moment,” Dalinar said, rising. Compared to\nwhat he’d felt in the vision, the air here was cold. Rain pelted the room’s\nclosed shutters, though he knew from experience that an end to his vision\nmeant that the storm had nearly spent itself.\nFeeling drained, he walked to a seat beside the wall and settled down.\nOnly he and Navani were in the room; he preferred it that way. Renarin and\nAdolin waited out the storm nearby, in another room of Dalinar’s quarters\nand under the watchful eyes of Captain Kaladin and his bridgeman\nbodyguards.\nPerhaps he should invite more scholars in to observe his visions; they"

But storms, he had enough trouble with one person watching him\nin such a state, raving and thrashing on the ground. He believed in the\nvisions, even depended upon them, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t\nembarrassing.\nNavani sat down beside him, and wrapped her arms around him. “Was it\nbad?”\n“This one? No. Not bad. Some running, then some fighting. I didn’t\nparticipate. The vision ended before I needed to help.”\n“Then why that expression?”\n“I have to refound the Knights Radiant.”\n“Refound the… But how? What does that even mean?”\n“I don’t know. I don’t know anything; I only have hints and shadowy\nthreats. Something dangerous is coming, that much is certain. I have to stop\nit.”\nShe rested her head on his shoulder. He stared at the hearth, which\ncrackled softly, giving the small room a warm glow. This was one of the\nfew hearths that hadn’t been converted to the new fabrial heating devices.\nHe preferred the real fire, though he wouldn’t say it to Navani. She\nworked so hard to bring new fabrials to them all.\n“Why you?” Navani asked. “Why do you have to do this?”\n“Why is one man born a king, and another a beggar?” Dalinar asked. “It\nis the way of the world.”\n“It is that easy for you?”\n“Not easy,” Dalinar said, “but there is no point in demanding answers.”\n“Particularly if the Almighty is dead…”\nPerhaps he should not have shared that fact with her. Speaking of just\nthat one idea could brand him a heretic, drive his own ardents from him,\ngive Sadeas a weapon against the Throne.\nIf the Almighty was dead, what did Dalinar worship? What did he\nbelieve?\n“We should record your memories of the vision,” Navani said with a\nsigh, pulling back from him. “While they are fresh.”\nHe nodded. It was important to have a description to match the\ntranscriptions. He began to recount what he’d seen, speaking slowly enough\nthat she could write it all down. He described the lake, the clothing of the\nmen, the strange fortress in the distance. She claimed there were stories of\nlarge structures on the Purelake told by some who lived there. Scholars had\nconsidered them mythological.\nDalinar stood up and paced as he moved on to the description of the\nunholy thing that had risen from the lake. “It left behind a hole in the\nlakebed,” Dalinar explained. “Imagine if you were to outline a body on the\nfloor, then watch that body rip itself free from the ground.\n“Imagine the tactical advantage such a thing would have. Spren move\nquickly and easily. One could slip in behind battle lines, then stand up and\nstart attacking the support staff. That beast’s stone body must have been\ndifficult to break. Storms… Shardblades. Makes me wonder if these are the\nthings the weapons were truly designed to fight.”\nNavani smiled as she wrote.\n“What?” Dalinar asked, stopping in his pacing."

Makes me wonder if these are the\nthings the weapons were truly designed to fight.”\nNavani smiled as she wrote.\n“What?” Dalinar asked, stopping in his pacing.\n“You are such a soldier.”\n“Yes. And?”\n“And it’s endearing,” she said, finishing her writing. “What happened\nnext?”\n“The Almighty spoke to me.” He gave her the monologue as best he\ncould remember while he paced in a slow, restful walk. I need to sleep\nmore, he thought. He wasn’t the youth he’d been twenty years ago, capable\nof staying up all night with Gavilar, listening with a cup of wine as his\nbrother made plans, then charging to battle the next day full of vigor and\nhungering for a contest.\nOnce he was done with his narrative, Navani rose, tucking her writing\nimplements away. She’d take what he’d said and have her scholars—well,\nhis scholars, which she’d appropriated—work at matching his Alethi words\nup with the transcriptions she’d recorded. Though, of course, she’d first\nremove the lines where he mentioned sensitive issues, such as the\nAlmighty’s death.\nShe’d also search for historical references to match his descriptions.\nNavani liked things neat and quantified. She’d prepared a timeline of all of\nhis visions, trying to piece them into a single narrative.\n“You’re still going to publish the proclamation this week?” she asked.\nDalinar nodded. He’d released it to the highprinces a week ago, in\nprivate. He’d intended to release it the same day to the camps, but Navani\nhad convinced him that this was the wiser course. News was seeping out,\nbut this would let the highprinces prepare.\n“The proclamation will go to the public within a few days,” he said.\n“Before the highprinces can put further pressure on Elhokar to retract it.”\nNavani pursed her lips.\n“It must be done,” Dalinar said.\n“You’re supposed to unite them.”\n“The highprinces are spoiled children,” Dalinar said. “Changing them\nwill require extreme measures.”\n“If you break the kingdom apart, we’ll never unify it.”\n“We’ll make certain that it doesn’t break.”\nNavani looked him up and down, then smiled. “I am fond of this more\nconfident you, I must admit. Now, if I could just borrow a little of that\nconfidence in regards to us…”\n“I am quite confident about us,” he said, pulling her close.\n“Is that so? Because this traveling between the king’s palace and your\ncomplex wastes a lot of my time each day. If I were to move my things here\n—say, into your quarters—think how much more convenient everything\nwould be.”\n“No.”\n“You’re confident they won’t let us marry, Dalinar. So what else are we\nto do? Is it the morality of the thing? You yourself said that the Almighty\nwas dead.”\n“Something is either right or it’s wrong,” Dalinar said, feeling stubborn.\n“The Almighty doesn’t come into it.”\n“God,” Navani said flatly, “doesn’t come into whether his commands\nare right or wrong.”\n“Er. Yes.”\n“Careful,” Navani said. “You’re sounding like Jasnah. Anyway, if God\nis dead—”"

If the Almighty died, then he was never God, that’s\nall.”\nShe sighed, still close to him. She went up on her toes and kissed him—\nand not demurely, either. Navani considered demureness for the coy and\nfrivolous. So, a passionate kiss, pressing against his mouth, pushing his\nhead backward, hungering for more. When she pulled away, Dalinar found\nhimself breathless.\nShe smiled at him, then turned and picked up her things—he hadn’t\nnoticed her dropping them during the kiss—and then walked to the door. “I\nam not a patient woman, you realize. I am as spoiled as those highprinces,\naccustomed to getting what I want.”\nHe snorted. Neither was true. She could be patient. When it suited her.\nWhat she meant was that it didn’t suit her at the moment.\nShe opened the door, and Captain Kaladin himself peered in, inspecting\nthe room. The bridgeman certainly was earnest. “Watch her as she travels\nhome for the day, soldier,” Dalinar said to him.\nKaladin saluted. Navani pushed by him and left without a goodbye,\nclosing the door and leaving Dalinar alone again.\nDalinar sighed deeply, then walked to the chair and settled down by the\nhearth to think.\nHe started awake some time later, the fire having burned out. Storms.\nWas he falling asleep in the middle of the day, now? If only he didn’t spend\nso much time at night tossing and turning, head full of worries and burdens\nthat should never have been his. What had happened to the simple days?\nHis hand on a sword, secure in the knowledge that Gavilar would handle\nthe difficult parts?\nDalinar stretched, rising. He needed to go over preparations for\nreleasing the king’s proclamation, and then see to the new guards—\nHe stopped. The wall of his room bore a series of stark white scratches\nforming glyphs. They hadn’t been there before.\nSixty-two days, the glyphs read. Death follows.\n* * *\nA short time later, Dalinar stood, straight-backed, hands clasped behind\nhim as he listened to Navani confer with Rushu, one of the Kholin scholars.\nAdolin stood nearby, inspecting a chunk of white rock that had been found\non the floor. It had apparently been pried from the row of ornamental stones\nrimming the room’s window, then used to write the glyphs.\nStraight back, head up, Dalinar told himself, even though you want to\njust slump in that chair. A leader did not slump. A leader was in control.\nEven when he least felt like he controlled anything.\nEspecially then.\n“Ah,” said Rushu—a young female ardent with long eyelashes and\nbuttonlike lips. “Look at the sloppy lines! The improper symmetry.\nWhoever did this is not practiced with drawing glyphs. They almost spelled\ndeath wrong—it looks more like ‘broken.’ And the meaning is vague. Death\nfollows? Or is it ‘follow death’? Or Sixty-Two Days of Death and\nFollowing? Glyphs are imprecise.”"

Glyphs are imprecise.”\n“Just make the copy, Rushu,” Navani said. “And don’t speak of this to\nanyone.”\n“Not even you?” Rushu asked, sounding distracted as she wrote.\nNavani sighed, walking over to Dalinar and Adolin. “She is good at\nwhat she does,” Navani said softly, “but she’s a little oblivious sometimes.\nAnyway, she knows handwriting better than anyone. It’s one of her many\nareas of interest.”\nDalinar nodded, bottling his fears.\n“Why would anyone do this?” Adolin asked, dropping the rock. “Is it\nsome kind of obscure threat?”\n“No,” Dalinar said.\nNavani met Dalinar’s eyes. “Rushu,” she said. “Leave us for a\nmoment.”\nThe woman didn’t respond at first, but scuttled out at further prompting.\nAs she opened the door, she revealed members of Bridge Four outside, led\nby Captain Kaladin, his expression dark. He’d escorted Navani away, then\ncome back to find this—and then had immediately sent men to check on\nand retrieve Navani.\nHe obviously considered this lapse his fault, thinking that someone had\nsneaked into Dalinar’s room while he was sleeping. Dalinar waved the\ncaptain in.\nKaladin hurried over, and hopefully didn’t see how Adolin’s jaw\ntightened as he regarded the man. Dalinar had been fighting the Parshendi\nShardbearer when Kaladin and Adolin had clashed on the battlefield, but\nhe’d heard talk of their run-in. His son certainly did not like hearing that\nthis darkeyed bridgeman had been put in charge of the Cobalt Guard.\n“Sir,” Captain Kaladin said, stepping up. “I’m embarrassed. One week\non the job, and I’ve failed you.”\n“You did as commanded, Captain,” Dalinar said.\n“I was commanded to keep you safe, sir,” Kaladin said, anger bleeding\ninto his voice. “I should have posted guards at individual doors inside your\nquarters, not just outside of the room complex.”\n“We’ll be more observant in the future, Captain,” Dalinar said. “Your\npredecessor always posted the same guard as you did, and it was sufficient\nbefore.”\n“Times were different before, sir,” Kaladin said, scanning the room and\nnarrowing his eyes. He focused on the window, too small to let someone\nslip in. “I still wish I knew how they got in. The guards heard nothing.”\nDalinar inspected the young soldier, scarred and dark of expression.\nWhy, Dalinar thought, do I trust this man so much? He couldn’t put his\nfinger on it, but over the years, he’d learned to trust his instincts as a soldier\nand a general. Something within him urged him to trust Kaladin, and he\naccepted those instincts.\n“This is a small matter,” Dalinar said.\nKaladin looked at him sharply.\n“Don’t worry yourself overly much about how the person got in to\nscribble on my wall,” Dalinar said. “Just be more watchful in the future.\nDismissed.” He nodded to Kaladin, who retreated reluctantly, pulling the\ndoor closed."

The mop-haired youth was as tall as Dalinar was.\nThat was hard to remember, sometimes. It didn’t seem so long ago that\nAdolin had been an eager little boy with a wooden sword.\n“You said you awoke to this here,” Navani said. “You said you didn’t\nsee anyone enter or hear anyone make the drawing.”\nDalinar nodded.\n“Then why,” she said, “do I get the sudden and distinct impression that\nyou know why it is here?”\n“I don’t know for certain who made it, but I know what it means.”\n“What, then?” Navani demanded.\n“It means we have very little time left,” Dalinar said. “Send out the\nproclamation, then go to the highprinces and arrange a meeting. They’ll\nwant to speak with me.”\nThe Everstorm comes…\nSixty-two days. Not enough time.\nIt was, apparently, all he had.\nBridge Four Tattoos\n5. Ideals\nThe sign on the wall proposed a greater\ndanger, even, than its deadline. To foresee the\nfuture is of the Voidbringers.\nFrom the journal of Navani Kholin,\nJeseses 1174\n“Toward victory and, at long last, vengeance.” The crier carried a writ\nwith the king’s words on it—bound between two cloth-covered boards—\nthough she obviously had the words memorized. Not surprising. Kaladin\nalone had made her repeat the proclamation three times.\n“Again,” he said, sitting on his stone beside Bridge Four’s firepit. Many\nmembers of the crew had lowered their breakfast bowls, going silent.\nNearby, Sigzil repeated the words to himself, memorizing them.\nThe crier sighed. She was a plump, lighteyed young woman with\nstrands of red hair mixed in her black, bespeaking Veden or Horneater\nheritage. There would be dozens of women like her moving through the\nwarcamp to read, and sometimes explain, Dalinar’s words.\nShe opened the ledger again. In any other battalion, Kaladin thought\nidly, its leader would be of a high enough social class to outrank her.\n“Under the authority of the king,” she said, “Dalinar Kholin, Highprince\nof War, hereby orders changes to the manner of collection and distribution\nof gemhearts on the Shattered Plains. Henceforth, each gemheart will be\ncollected in turn by two highprinces working in tandem. The spoils become\nthe property of the king, who will determine—based on the effectiveness of\nthe parties involved and their alacrity to obey—their share.\n“A prescribed rotation will detail which highprinces and armies are\nresponsible for hunting gemhearts, and in what order. The pairings will not\nalways be the same, and will be judged based on strategic compatibility. It\nis expected that by the Codes we all hold dear, the men and women of these\narmies will welcome this renewed focus on victory and, at long last,\nvengeance.”\nThe crier snapped the book closed, looking up at Kaladin and cocking a\nlong black eyebrow he was pretty sure had been painted on with makeup."

She nodded to him, then moved off toward the\nnext battalion square.\nKaladin climbed to his feet. “Well, there’s the storm we’ve been\nexpecting.”\nThe men nodded. Conversation at Bridge Four had been subdued,\nfollowing the strange break-in at Dalinar’s quarters yesterday. Kaladin felt a\nfool. Dalinar, however, seemed to be ignoring the break-in entirely. He\nknew far more than he was telling Kaladin. How am I supposed to do my\njob if I don’t have the information I need?\nNot two weeks on the job, and already the politics and machinations of\nthe lighteyes were tripping him up.\n“The highprinces are going to hate this proclamation,” Leyten said from\nbeside the firepit, where he was working on Beld’s breastplate straps, which\nhad come from the quartermaster with the buckles twisted about. “They\nbase pretty much everything on getting those gemhearts. We’re going to\nhave discontent aplenty on today’s winds.”\n“Ha!” Rock said, ladling up curry for Lopen, who had come back for\nseconds. “Discontent? Today, this will mean riots. Did you not hear that\nmention of the Codes? This thing, it is an insult against the others, whom\nwe know do not follow their oaths.” He was smiling, and seemed to\nconsider the anger—even rioting—of the highprinces to be amusing.\n“Moash, Drehy, Mart, and Eth with me,” Kaladin said. “We’ve got to go\nrelieve Skar and his team. Teft, how goes your assignment?”\n“Slowly,” Teft said. “Those lads in the other bridge crews… they have a\nlong way to go. We need something more, Kal. Some way to inspire them.”\n“I’ll work on it,” Kaladin said. “For now, we should try food. Rock,\nwe’ve only got five officers at the moment, so you can have that last room\non the outside for storage. Kholin gave us requisition rights from the camp\nquartermaster. Pack it full.”\n“Full?” Rock asked, an enormous grin splitting his face. “How full?”\n“Very,” Kaladin said. “We’ve been eating broth and stew with Soulcast\ngrain for months. For the next month, Bridge Four eats like kings.”\n“No shells, now,” Mart said, pointing at Rock as he gathered his spear\nand did up his uniform jacket. “Just because you can fix anything you want,\nit doesn’t mean we’re going to eat something stupid.”\n“Airsick lowlanders,” Rock said. “Don’t you want to be strong?”\n“I want to keep my teeth, thank you,” Mart said. “Crazy Horneater.”\n“I will fix two things,” Rock said, hand to his chest, as if making a\nsalute. “One for the brave and one for the silly. You may choose between\nthese things.”\n“You’ll make feasts, Rock,” Kaladin said. “I need you to train cooks for\nthe other barracks. Even if Dalinar has extra cooks to spare now with fewer"

        "text": "these things.”\n“You’ll make feasts, Rock,” Kaladin said. “I need you to train cooks for\nthe other barracks. Even if Dalinar has extra cooks to spare now with fewer\nregular troops to feed, I want the bridgemen to be self-sufficient. Lopen,\nI’m assigning Dabbid and Shen to help you assist Rock from here on out.\nWe need to turn those thousand men into soldiers. It starts the same way it\ndid with all of you—by filling their stomachs.”\n“It will be done,” Rock said, laughing, slapping Shen on the shoulder as\nthe parshman stepped up for seconds. He’d only just started doing things\nlike that, and seemed to hide in the back less than he once had. “I will not\neven put any dung in it!”\nThe others chuckled. Putting dung in food was what had gotten Rock\nturned into a bridgeman in the first place. As Kaladin started out toward the\nking’s palace—Dalinar had an important meeting with the king today—\nSigzil joined him.\n“A moment of your time, sir,” Sigzil said quietly.\n“If you wish.”\n“You promised me that I could have a chance to measure your…\nparticular abilities.”\n“Promised?” Kaladin asked. “I don’t remember a promise.”\n“You grunted.”\n“I… grunted?”\n“When I talked about taking some measurements. You seemed to think\nit was a good idea, and you told Skar we could help you figure out your\npowers.”\n“I suppose I did.”\n“We need to know exactly what you can do, sir—the extent of the\nabilities, the length of time the Stormlight remains in you. Do you agree\nthat having a clear understanding of your limits would be valuable?”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said reluctantly.\n“Excellent. Then…”\n“Give me a couple of days,” Kaladin said. “Go prepare a place where\nwe can’t be seen. Then… yes, all right. I’ll let you measure me.”\n“Excellent,” Sigzil said. “I’ve been devising some experiments.” He\nstopped on the path, allowing Kaladin and the others to draw away from\nhim.\nKaladin rested his spear on his shoulder and relaxed his hand. He\nfrequently found his grip on the weapon too strong, his knuckles white. It\nwas like part of him still didn’t believe he could carry it in public now, and\nfeared it would be taken from him again.\nSyl floated down from her daily sprint around the camp on the morning\nwinds. She alighted on his shoulder and sat, seeming lost in thought.\nDalinar’s warcamp was an organized place. Soldiers never lounged\nlazily here. They were always doing something. Working on their weapons,\nfetching food, carrying cargo, patrolling. Men patrolled a lot in this camp.\nEven with the reduced army numbers, Kaladin passed three patrols as his\nmen marched toward the gates. That was three more than he’d ever seen in\nSadeas’s camp.\nHe was reminded again of the emptiness. The dead didn’t need to\nbecome Voidbringers to haunt this camp; the empty barracks did that. He\npassed one woman, seated on the ground beside one of those hollow\nbarracks, staring up at the sky and clutching a bundle of masculine clothing.\nTwo small children stood on the path beside her.

Too silent. Children that\nsmall shouldn’t be quiet.\nThe barracks formed blocks in an enormous ring, and in the center of\nthem was a more populated part of camp—the bustling section that\ncontained Dalinar’s living complex, along with the quarters of the various\nhighlords and generals. Dalinar’s complex was a moundlike stone bunker\nwith fluttering banners and scuttling clerks carrying armfuls of ledgers.\nNearby, several officers had set up recruitment tents, and a long line of\nwould-be soldiers had formed. Some were sellswords who had made their\nway to the Shattered Plains seeking work. Others were bakers or the like,\nwho had heeded the cry for more soldiers following the disaster.\n“Why didn’t you laugh?” Syl said, inspecting the line as Kaladin hiked\naround it, on toward the gates out of the warcamp.\n“I’m sorry,” he replied. “Did you do something funny that I didn’t see?”\n“I mean earlier,” she said. “Rock and the others laughed. You didn’t.\nWhen you laughed during the weeks things were hard, I knew that you were\nforcing yourself to. I thought, maybe, once things got better…”\n“I’ve got an entire battalion of bridgemen to keep track of now,”\nKaladin said, eyes forward. “And a highprince to keep alive. I’m in the\nmiddle of a camp full of widows. I guess I don’t feel like laughing.”\n“But things are better,” she said. “For you and your men. Think of what\nyou did, what you accomplished.”\nA day spent on a plateau, slaughtering. A perfect melding of himself, his\nweapon, and the storms themselves. And he’d killed with it. Killed to\nprotect a lighteyes.\nHe’s different, Kaladin thought.\nThey always said that.\n“I guess I’m just waiting,” Kaladin said.\n“For what?”\n“The thunder,” Kaladin said softly. “It always follows after the\nlightning. Sometimes you have to wait, but eventually it comes.”\n“I…” Syl zipped up in front of him, standing in the air, moving\nbackward as he walked. She didn’t fly—she didn’t have wings—and didn’t\nbob in the air. She just stood there, on nothing, and moved in unison with\nhim. She seemed to take no notice of normal physical laws.\nShe cocked her head at him. “I don’t understand what you mean. Drat! I\nthought I was figuring this all out. Storms? Lightning?”\n“You know how, when you encouraged me to fight to save Dalinar, it\nstill hurt you when I killed?”\n“Yes.”\n“It’s like that,” Kaladin said softly. He looked to the side. He was again\ngripping his spear too tightly.\nSyl watched him, hands on hips, waiting for him to say more.\n“Something bad is going to happen,” Kaladin said. “Things can’t just\ncontinue to be good for me. That’s not how life is. It might have to do with\nthose glyphs on Dalinar’s wall yesterday. They seemed like a countdown.”\nShe nodded.\n“Have you ever seen anything like that before?”"

They seemed like a countdown.”\nShe nodded.\n“Have you ever seen anything like that before?”\n“I remember… something,” she whispered. “Something bad. Seeing\nwhat is to come—it isn’t of Honor, Kaladin. It’s something else. Something\ndangerous.”\nWonderful.\nWhen he said nothing more, Syl sighed and zipped into the air,\nbecoming a ribbon of light. She followed him up there, moving between\ngusts of wind.\nShe said that she’s honorspren, Kaladin thought. So why does she still\nkeep up the act of playing with winds?\nHe’d have to ask her, assuming she’d answer him. Assuming she even\nknew the answer.\n* * *\nTorol Sadeas laced his fingers before himself, elbows on the fine\nstonework tabletop, as he stared at the Shardblade he’d thrust down through\nthe center of the table. It reflected his face.\nDamnation. When had he gotten old? He imagined himself as a young\nman, in his twenties. Now he was fifty. Storming fifty. He set his jaw,\nlooking at that Blade.\nOathbringer. It was Dalinar’s Shardblade—curved, like a back arching,\nwith a hooklike tip on the end matched by a sequence of jutting serrations\nby the crossguard. Like waves in motion, peeking up from the ocean below.\nHow often had he lusted for this weapon? Now it was his, but he found\nthe possession hollow. Dalinar Kholin—driven mad by grief, broken to the\npoint that battle frightened him—still clung to life. Sadeas’s old friend was\nlike a favored axehound he’d been forced to put down, only to find it\nwhimpering at the window, the poison having not quite done its work.\nWorse, he couldn’t shake the feeling that Dalinar had gotten the better\nof him somehow.\nThe door to his sitting room opened, and Ialai slipped in. With a slender\nneck and a large mouth, his wife had never been described as a beauty—\nparticularly as the years stretched long. He didn’t care. Ialai was the most\ndangerous woman he knew. That was more attractive than any simple pretty\nface.\n“You’ve destroyed my table, I see,” she said, eyeing the Shardblade\nslammed down through the center. She flopped down onto the small couch\nbeside him, draped one arm across his back, and put her feet up on the\ntable.\nWhile with others, she was the perfect Alethi woman. In private, she\npreferred to lounge. “Dalinar is recruiting heavily,” she said. “I’ve taken the\nopportunity to place a few more of my associates among the staff of his\nwarcamp.”\n“Soldiers?”\n“What do you take me for? That would be far too obvious; he will have\nnew soldiers under careful watch. However, much of his support staff has\nholes as men join the call to take up spears and reinforce his army.”\nSadeas nodded, still staring at that Blade. His wife ran the most\nimpressive network of spies in the warcamps. Most impressive indeed,\nsince very, very few knew of it. She scratched at his back, sending shivers\nup the skin.\n“He released his proclamation,” Ialai noted."

The others hate it.”\nSadeas nodded. “Dalinar should be dead, but since he is not, at least we\ncan depend upon him to hang himself in time.” Sadeas narrowed his eyes.\n“By destroying him, I sought to prevent the collapse of the kingdom. Now\nI’m wondering if that collapse wouldn’t be better for us all.”\n“What?”\n“I’m not meant for this, love,” Sadeas whispered. “This stupid game on\nthe plateaus. It sated me at first, but I’m growing to loathe it. I want war,\nIalai. Not hours of marching on the off chance that we’ll find some little\nskirmish!”\n“Those little skirmishes bring us wealth.”\nWhich was why he’d suffered them so long. He rose. “I will need to\nmeet with some of the others. Aladar. Ruthar. We need to fan the flames\namong the other highprinces, raise their indignation at what Dalinar\nattempts.”\n“And our end goal?”\n“I will have it back, Ialai,” he said, resting his fingers on Oathbringer’s\nhilt. “The conquest.”\nIt was the only thing that made him feel alive any longer. That glorious,\nwonderful Thrill of being on the battlefield and striving, man against man.\nOf risking everything for the prize. Domination. Victory.\nIt was the only time he felt like a youth again.\nIt was a brutal truth. The best truths, however, were simple.\nHe grabbed Oathbringer by the hilt and yanked it up out of the table.\n“Dalinar wants to play politician now, which is unsurprising. He has always\nsecretly wanted to be his brother. Fortunately for us, Dalinar is no good at\nthis sort of thing. His proclamation will alienate the others. He will push the\nhighprinces, and they’ll take up arms against him, fracturing the kingdom.\nAnd then, with blood at my feet and Dalinar’s own sword in my hand, I will\nforge a new Alethkar from flame and tears.”\n“What if, instead, he succeeds?”\n“That, my dear, is when your assassins will be of use.” He dismissed the\nShardblade; it turned to mist and vanished. “I will conquer this kingdom\nanew, and then Jah Keved will follow. After all, the purpose of this life is to\ntrain soldiers. In a way, I’m only doing what God himself wants.”\n* * *\nThe walk between the barracks and the king’s palace—which the king\nhad started calling the Pinnacle—took an hour or so, which gave Kaladin\nplenty of time to think. Unfortunately, on his way, he passed a group of\nDalinar’s surgeons in a field with servants, gathering knobweed sap for an\nantiseptic.\nSeeing them made Kaladin think not only of his own efforts gathering\nthe sap, but of his father. Lirin.\nIf he were here, Kaladin thought as he passed them, he’d ask why I\nwasn’t out there, with the surgeons. He’d demand to know why, if Dalinar\nhad taken me in, I hadn’t requested to join his medical corps."

        "text": "wasn’t out there, with the surgeons. He’d demand to know why, if Dalinar\nhad taken me in, I hadn’t requested to join his medical corps.\nIn fact, Kaladin could probably have gotten Dalinar to employ all of\nBridge Four as surgeons’ assistants. Kaladin could have trained them in\nmedicine almost as easily as he had the spear. Dalinar would have done it.\nAn army could never have too many good surgeons.\nHe hadn’t even considered it. The choice for him had been simpler—\neither become Dalinar’s bodyguards or leave the warcamps. Kaladin had\nchosen to put his men in the path of the storm again. Why?\nEventually, they reached the king’s palace, which was built up the side\nof a large stone hill, with tunnels dug down into the rock. The king’s own\nquarters sat at the very top. That meant lots of climbing for Kaladin and his\nmen.\nThey hiked up the switchbacks, Kaladin still lost in thought about his\nfather and his duty.\n“That’s a tad unfair, you know,” Moash said as they reached the top.\nKaladin looked to the others, realizing that they were puffing from the\nlong climb. Kaladin, however, had drawn in Stormlight without noticing.\nHe wasn’t even winded.\nHe smiled pointedly for Syl’s benefit, and regarded the cavernous\nhallways of the Pinnacle. A few men stood guard at the entrance gates,\nwearing the blue and gold of the King’s Guard, a separate and distinct unit\nfrom Dalinar’s own guard.\n“Soldier,” Kaladin said with a nod to one of them, a lighteyes of low\nrank. Militarily, Kaladin outranked a man like this—but not socially. Again,\nhe wasn’t certain how all of this was supposed to work.\nThe man looked him up and down. “I heard you held a bridge,\npractically by yourself, against hundreds of Parshendi. How’d you do that?”\nHe did not address Kaladin with “sir,” as would have been appropriate for\nany other captain.\n“You want to find out?” Moash snapped from behind. “We can show\nyou. Personally.”\n“Hush,” Kaladin said, glaring at Moash. He turned back to the soldier.\n“I got lucky. That’s it.” He stared the man in the eyes.\n“I suppose that makes sense,” the soldier said.\nKaladin waited.\n“Sir,” the soldier finally added.\nKaladin waved his men forward, and they passed the lighteyed guards.\nThe interior of the palace was lit by spheres grouped in lamps on the walls\n—sapphires and diamonds blended to give a blue-white cast. The spheres\nwere a small but striking reminder of how things had changed. Nobody\nwould have let bridgemen near such casual use of spheres.\nThe Pinnacle was still unfamiliar to Kaladin—so far, his time spent\nguarding Dalinar had mostly been in the warcamp. However, he’d made\ncertain to look over maps of the place, so he knew the way to the top.\n“Why did you cut me off like that?” Moash demanded, catching up to\nKaladin.\n“You were in the wrong,” Kaladin said. “You’re a soldier now, Moash.\nYou’re going to have to learn to act like one. And that means not provoking\nfights.”"

And that means not provoking\nfights.”\n“I’m not going to scrape and bow before lighteyes, Kal. Not anymore.”\n“I don’t expect you to scrape, but I do expect you to watch your tongue.\nBridge Four is better than petty gibes and threats.”\nMoash fell back, but Kaladin could tell he was still smoldering.\n“That’s odd,” Syl said, landing on Kaladin’s shoulder again. “He looks\nso angry.”\n“When I took over the bridgemen,” Kaladin said softly, “they were\ncaged animals who had been beaten into submission. I brought back their\nfight, but they were still caged. Now the doors are off those cages. It will\ntake time for Moash and the others to adjust.”\nThey would. During the final weeks as bridgemen, they’d learned to act\nwith the precision and discipline of soldiers. They stood at attention while\ntheir abusers marched across bridges, never uttering a word of derision.\nTheir discipline itself had become their weapon.\nThey’d learn to be real soldiers. No, they were real soldiers. Now they\nhad to learn how to act without Sadeas’s oppression to push against.\nMoash moved up beside him. “I’m sorry,” he said softly. “You’re right.”\nKaladin smiled, this time genuinely.\n“I’m not going to pretend I don’t hate them,” Moash said. “But I’ll be\ncivil. We have a duty. We’ll do it well. Better than anyone expects. We’re\nBridge Four.”\n“Good man,” Kaladin said. Moash was going to be particularly tricky to\ndeal with, as more and more, Kaladin found himself confiding in the man.\nMost of the others idolized Kaladin. Not Moash, who was as close to a real\nfriend as Kaladin had known since being branded.\nThe hallway grew surprisingly decorative as they approached the king’s\nconference chamber. There was even a series of reliefs being carved on the\nwalls—the Heralds, embellished with gemstones on the rock to glow at\nappropriate locations.\nMore and more like a city, Kaladin thought to himself. This might\nactually be a true palace soon.\nHe met Skar and his team at the door into the king’s conference\nchambers. “Report?” Kaladin asked softly.\n“Quiet morning,” Skar said. “And I’m fine with that.”\n“You’re relieved for the day, then,” Kaladin said. “I’ll stay here for the\nmeeting, then let Moash take the afternoon shift. I’ll come back for the\nevening shift. You and your squad get some sleep; you’ll be back on duty\ntonight, stretching to tomorrow morning.”\n“Got it, sir,” Skar said, saluting. He collected his men and moved off.\nThe chamber beyond the doors was decorated with a thick rug and large\nunshuttered windows on the leeward side. Kaladin had never been in this\nroom, and the palace maps—for the protection of the king—only included\nthe basic hallways and routes through the servants’ quarters. This room had\none other door, probably out onto the balcony, but no exits other than the\none Kaladin stepped through."

This room had\none other door, probably out onto the balcony, but no exits other than the\none Kaladin stepped through.\nTwo other guards in blue and gold stood on either side of the door. The\nking himself paced back and forth beside the room’s desk. His nose was\nlarger than the paintings of him showed.\nDalinar spoke with Highlady Navani, an elegant woman with grey in\nher hair. The scandalous relationship between the king’s uncle and mother\nwould have been the talk of the warcamp, if Sadeas’s betrayal hadn’t\novershadowed it.\n“Moash,” Kaladin said, pointing. “See where that door goes. Mart and\nEth, stand watch just outside in the hall. Nobody other than a highprince\ncomes in until you’ve checked with us in here.”\nMoash gave the king a salute instead of a bow, and checked on the door.\nIt indeed led to the balcony that Kaladin had spotted from below. It ran all\naround this upmost room.\nDalinar studied Kaladin and Moash as they worked. Kaladin saluted,\nand met the man’s eyes. He wasn’t going to fail again, as he’d done the day\nbefore.\n“I don’t recognize these guards, Uncle,” the king said with annoyance.\n“They’re new,” Dalinar said. “There is no other way onto that balcony,\nsoldier. It’s a hundred feet in the air.”\n“Good to know,” Kaladin said. “Drehy, join Moash out there on the\nbalcony, close the door, and keep watch.”\nDrehy nodded, jumping into motion.\n“I just said there’s no way to reach that balcony from the outside,”\nDalinar said.\n“Then that’s the way I’d try to get in,” Kaladin said, “if I wanted to, sir.”\nDalinar smiled in amusement.\nThe king, however, was nodding. “Good… good.”\n“Are there any other ways into this room, Your Majesty?” Kaladin\nasked. “Secret entrances, passages?”\n“If there were,” the king said, “I wouldn’t want people knowing about\nthem.”\n“My men can’t keep this room safe if we don’t know what to guard. If\nthere are passages nobody is supposed to know about, those are\nimmediately suspect. If you share them with me, I’ll use only my officers in\nguarding them.”\nThe king stared at Kaladin for a moment, then turned to Dalinar. “I like\nthis one. Why haven’t you put him in charge of your guard before?”\n“I haven’t had the opportunity,” Dalinar said, studying Kaladin with\neyes that had a depth behind them. A weight. He stepped over and rested a\nhand on Kaladin’s shoulder, pulling him aside.\n“Wait,” the king said from behind, “is that a captain’s insignia? On a\ndarkeyes? When did that start happening?”\nDalinar didn’t answer, instead walking Kaladin to the side of the room.\n“The king,” he said softly, “is very worried about assassins. You should\nknow this.”\n“A healthy paranoia makes the job easier for his bodyguards, sir,”\nKaladin said.\n“I didn’t say it was healthy,” Dalinar said. “You call me ‘sir.’ The\ncommon address is ‘Brightlord.’”"

This\nman had put him in the role, so Kaladin would assume it came with certain\nprivileges, unless told otherwise. “Every man I’ve ever called ‘Brightlord’\nhas betrayed me. A few men I’ve called ‘sir’ still have my trust to this day. I\nuse one more reverently than the other. Sir.”\n“You’re an odd one, son.”\n“The normal ones are dead in the chasms, sir,” Kaladin said softly.\n“Sadeas saw to that.”\n“Well, have your men on the balcony guard from farther to the side,\nwhere they can’t hear through the window.”\n“I’ll wait with the men in the hall, then,” Kaladin said, noticing that the\ntwo men of the King’s Guard had already moved through the doors.\n“I didn’t order that,” Dalinar said. “Guard the doors, but on the inside. I\nwant you to hear what we’re planning. Just don’t repeat it outside this\nroom.”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Four more people are coming to the meeting,” Dalinar said. “My sons,\nGeneral Khal, and Brightness Teshav, Khal’s wife. They may enter. Anyone\nelse should be kept back until the meeting is over.”\nDalinar went back to a conversation with the king’s mother. Kaladin got\nMoash and Drehy positioned, then explained the door protocol to Mart and\nEth. He’d have to do some training later. Lighteyes never truly meant\n“Don’t let anyone else in” when they said “Don’t let anyone else in.” What\nthey meant was “If you let anyone else in, I’d better agree that it was\nimportant enough, or you’re in trouble.”\nThen, Kaladin took his post inside the closed door, standing against a\nwall with carved paneling made of a rare type of wood he didn’t recognize.\nIt’s probably worth more than I’ve earned in my entire lifetime, he thought\nidly. One wooden panel.\nThe highprince’s sons arrived, Adolin and Renarin Kholin. Kaladin had\nseen the former on the battlefield, though he looked different without his\nShardplate. Less imposing. More like a spoiled rich boy. Oh, he wore a\nuniform like everyone else, but the buttons were engraved, and the boots…\nthose were expensive hogshide ones without a scuff on them. Brand new,\nlikely bought at ridiculous expense.\nHe did save that woman in the market, though, Kaladin thought,\nremembering the encounter from weeks ago. Don’t forget about that.\nKaladin wasn’t sure what to make of Renarin. The youth—he might\nhave been older than Kaladin, but sure didn’t look it—wore spectacles and\nwalked after his brother like a shadow.

That might\nbe important to his job.” Dalinar didn’t look toward Adolin or Kaladin.\nAdolin walked up, taking Dalinar by the arm and speaking in a hushed\ntone that was not so soft that Kaladin couldn’t hear. “We barely know him.”\n“We have to trust some people, Adolin,” his father said in a normal\nvoice. “If there’s one person in this army I can guarantee isn’t working for\nSadeas, it’s that soldier.” He turned and glanced at Kaladin, once again\nstudying him with those unfathomable eyes.\nHe didn’t see me with the Stormlight, Kaladin told himself forcefully.\nHe was practically unconscious. He doesn’t know.\nDoes he?\nAdolin threw up his hands but walked to the other side of the room,\nmuttering something to his brother. Kaladin remained in position, standing\ncomfortably at parade rest. Yes, definitely spoiled.\nThe general who arrived soon after was a limber, bald man with a\nstraight back and pale yellow eyes. His wife, Teshav, had a pinched face\nand hair streaked blond. She took up position by the writing desk, which\nNavani had made no move to occupy.\n“Reports,” Dalinar said from the window as the door clicked shut\nbehind the two newcomers.\n“I suspect you know what you’ll hear, Brightlord,” said Teshav.\n“They’re irate. They sincerely hoped you would reconsider the command—\nand sending it out to the public has provoked them. Highprince Hatham was\nthe only one to make a public announcement. He plans to—and I quote\n—‘see that the king is dissuaded from this reckless and ill-advised course.’”\nThe king sighed, settling into his seat. Renarin sat down immediately, as\ndid the general. Adolin found his seat more reluctantly.\nDalinar remained standing, looking out the window.\n“Uncle?” the king asked. “Did you hear that reaction? It’s a good thing\nyou didn’t go so far as you had considered: to proclaim that they must\nfollow the Codes or face seizure of assets. We’d be in the middle of a\nrebellion.”\n“That will come,” Dalinar said. “I still wonder if I should have\nannounced it all at once. When you’ve got an arrow stuck in you, it’s\nsometimes best to just yank it out in one pull.”\nActually, when you had an arrow in you, the best thing to do was leave\nit there until you could find a surgeon. Often it would plug the blood flow\nand keep you alive. It was probably best not to speak up and undermine the\nhighprince’s metaphor, however."

It was probably best not to speak up and undermine the\nhighprince’s metaphor, however.\n“Storms, what a ghastly image,” the king said, wiping his face with a\nhandkerchief. “Do you have to say such things, Uncle? I already fear we’ll\nbe dead before the week is out.”\n“Your father and I survived worse than this,” Dalinar said.\n“You had allies, then! Three highprinces for you, only six against, and\nyou never fought them all at the same time.”\n“If the highprinces unite against us,” General Khal said, “we will not be\nable to stand firm. We’ll have no choice but to rescind this proclamation,\nwhich will weaken the Throne considerably.”\nThe king leaned back, hand to his forehead. “Jezerezeh, this is going to\nbe a disaster…”\nKaladin raised an eyebrow.\n“You disagree?” Syl asked, moving over toward him as a cluster of\nfluttering leaves. It was disconcerting to hear her voice coming from such\nshapes. The others in the room, of course, couldn’t see or hear her.\n“No,” Kaladin whispered. “This proclamation sounds like a real\ntempest. I just expected the king to be less… well, whiny.”\n“We need to secure allies,” Adolin said. “Form a coalition. Sadeas will\ngather one, and so we counter him with our own.”\n“Dividing the kingdom into two?” Teshav said, shaking her head. “I\ndon’t see how a civil war would serve the Throne. Particularly one we’re\nunlikely to win.”\n“This could be the end of Alethkar as a kingdom,” the general agreed.\n“Alethkar ended as a kingdom centuries ago,” Dalinar said softly,\nstaring out that window. “This thing we have created is not Alethkar.\nAlethkar was justice. We are children wearing our father’s cloak.”\n“But Uncle,” the king said, “at least the kingdom is something. More\nthan it has been in centuries! If we fail here, and fracture to ten warring\nprincedoms, it will negate everything my father worked for!”\n“This isn’t what your father worked for, son,” Dalinar said. “This game\non the Shattered Plains, this nauseating political farce. This isn’t what\nGavilar envisioned. The Everstorm comes…”\n“What?” the king asked.\nDalinar turned from the window finally, walking to the others, and\nrested his hand on Navani’s shoulder. “We’re going to find a way to do this,\nor we’re going to destroy the kingdom in the process. I won’t suffer this\ncharade any longer.”\nKaladin, arms folded, tapped one finger against his elbow. “Dalinar acts\nlike he’s the king,” he mouthed, whispering so softly only Syl could hear.\n“And everyone else does as well.” Troubling. It was like what Amaram had\ndone. Seizing the power he saw before him, even if it wasn’t his.\nNavani looked up at Dalinar, raising her hand to rest on his. She was in\non whatever he was planning, judging by that expression.\nThe king wasn’t. He sighed lightly. “You’ve obviously got a plan,"

He sighed lightly. “You’ve obviously got a plan,\nUncle. Well? Out with it. This drama is tiring.”\n“What I really want to do,” Dalinar said frankly, “is beat the lot of them\nsenseless. That’s what I’d do to new recruits who weren’t willing to obey\norders.”\n“I think you’ll have a hard time spanking obedience into the\nhighprinces, Uncle,” the king said dryly. For some reason, he absently\nrubbed at his chest.\n“You need to disarm them,” Kaladin found himself saying.\nAll eyes in the room turned toward him. Brightness Teshav gave him a\nfrown, as if speaking were not Kaladin’s right. It probably wasn’t.\nDalinar, however, nodded toward him. “Soldier? You have a\nsuggestion?”\n“Your pardon, sir,” Kaladin said. “And your pardon, Your Majesty. But\nif a squad is giving you trouble, the first thing you do is separate its\nmembers. Split them up, stick them in better squads. I don’t think you can\ndo that here.”\n“I don’t know how we’d break apart the highprinces,” Dalinar said. “I\ndoubt I could stop them from associating with one another. Perhaps if this\nwar were won, I could assign different highprinces different duties, send\nthem off, then work on them individually. But for the time being, we are\ntrapped here.”\n“Well, the second thing you do to troublemakers,” Kaladin said, “is you\ndisarm them. They’re easier to control if you make them turn in their\nspears. It’s embarrassing, makes them feel like recruits again. So… can you\ntake their troops away from them, maybe?”\n“We can’t, I’m afraid,” Dalinar said. “The soldiers swore allegiance to\ntheir lighteyes, not to the Crown specifically—it’s only the highprinces who\nhave sworn to the Crown. However, you are thinking along the right lines.”\nHe squeezed Navani’s shoulder. “For the last two weeks,” he said, “I’ve\nbeen trying to decide how to approach this problem. My gut tells me that I\nneed to treat the highprinces—the entire lighteyed population of Alethkar—\nlike new recruits, in need of discipline.”\n“He came to me, and we talked,” Navani said. “We can’t actually bust\nthe highprinces down to a manageable rank, as much as Dalinar would like\nto do just that. Instead, we need to lead them to believe that we’re going to\ntake it all from them, if they don’t shape up.”\n“This proclamation will make them mad,” Dalinar said. “I want them\nmad. I want them to think about the war, their place here, and I want to\nremind them of Gavilar’s assassination. If I can push them to act more like\nsoldiers, even if it starts with them taking up arms against me, then I might\nbe able to persuade them. I can reason with soldiers. Regardless, a big part\nof this will involve the threat that I’m going to take away their authority and\npower if they don’t use it correctly. And that begins, as Captain Kaladin"

And that begins, as Captain Kaladin\nsuggested, with disarming them.”\n“Disarm the highprinces?” the king asked. “What foolishness is this?”\n“It’s not foolishness,” Dalinar said, smiling. “We can’t take their armies\nfrom them, but we can do something else. Adolin, I intend to take the lock\noff your scabbard.”\nAdolin frowned, considering that for a moment. Then a wide grin split\nhis face. “You mean, letting me duel again? For real?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. He turned to the king. “For the longest time, I’ve\nforbidden him from important bouts, as the Codes prohibit duels of honor\nbetween officers at war. More and more, however, I’ve come to realize that\nthe others don’t see themselves as being at war. They’re playing a game. It’s\ntime to allow Adolin to duel the camp’s other Shardbearers in official\nbouts.”\n“So he can humiliate them?” the king asked.\n“It wouldn’t be about humiliation; it would be about depriving them of\ntheir Shards.” Dalinar stepped into the middle of the group of chairs. “The\nhighprinces would have a hard time fighting against us if we controlled all\nof the Shardblades and Shardplate in the army. Adolin, I want you to\nchallenge the Shardbearers of other highprinces in duels of honor, the prizes\nbeing the Shards themselves.”\n“They won’t agree to it,” General Khal said. “They’ll refuse the bouts.”\n“We’ll have to make sure they agree,” Dalinar said. “Find a way to\nforce them, or shame them, into the fights. I’ve considered that this would\nprobably be easier if we could ever track down where Wit ran off to.”\n“What happens if the lad loses?” General Khal asked. “This plan seems\ntoo unpredictable.”\n“We’ll see,” Dalinar said. “This is only one part of what we will do, the\nsmaller part—but also the most visible part. Adolin, everyone tells me how\ngood you are at dueling, and you have pestered me incessantly to relax my\nprohibition. There are thirty Shardbearers in the army, not counting our\nown. Can you defeat that many men?”\n“Can I?” Adolin said, grinning. “I’ll do it without breaking a sweat, so\nlong as I can start with Sadeas himself.”\nSo he’s spoiled and cocky, Kaladin thought.\n“No,” Dalinar said. “Sadeas won’t accept a personal challenge, though\neventually bringing him down is our goal. We start with some of the lesser\nShardbearers and work up.”\nThe others in the room seemed troubled. That included Brightness\nNavani, who drew her lips to a line and glanced at Adolin. She might be in\non Dalinar’s plan, but she didn’t love the idea of her nephew dueling.\nShe didn’t say so. “As Dalinar indicated,” Navani said, “this won’t be\nour entire plan. Hopefully, Adolin’s duels won’t need to go far. They are\nmeant mostly to inspire worry and fear, to apply pressure to some factions\nwho are working against us. The greater part of what we must do will entail"

The greater part of what we must do will entail\na complex and determined political effort to connect with those who can be\nswayed to our side.”\n“Navani and I will work to persuade the highprinces of the advantages\nof a truly unified Alethkar,” Dalinar said, nodding. “Though the Storm-\nfather knows, I’m less certain of my political acumen than Adolin is of his\ndueling. It is what must be. If Adolin is to be the stick, I must be the\nfeather.”\n“There will be assassins, Uncle,” Elhokar said, sounding tired. “I don’t\nthink Khal is right; I don’t think Alethkar will shatter immediately. The\nhighprinces have come to like the idea of being one kingdom. But they also\nlike their sport, their fun, their gemhearts. So they will send assassins.\nQuietly, at first, and probably not directly at you or me. Our families.\nSadeas and the others will try to hurt us, make us back down. Are you\nwilling to risk your sons on this? How about my mother?”\n“Yes, you are right,” Dalinar said. “I hadn’t… but yes. That is how they\nthink.” He sounded regretful to Kaladin.\n“And you’re still willing to go through with this plan?” the king asked.\n“I have no choice,” Dalinar said, turning away, walking back toward the\nwindow. Looking out westward, in toward the continent.\n“Then at least tell me this,” Elhokar said. “What is your endgame,\nUncle? What is it you want out of all of this? In a year, if we survive this\nfiasco, what do you want us to be?”\nDalinar put his hands on the thick stone windowsill. He stared out, as if\nat something he could see and the rest of them could not. “I’ll have us be\nwhat we were before, son. A kingdom that can stand through storms, a\nkingdom that is a light and not a darkness. I will have a truly unified\nAlethkar, with highprinces who are loyal and just. I’ll have more than that.”\nHe tapped the windowsill. “I’m going to refound the Knights Radiant.”\nKaladin nearly dropped his spear in shock. Fortunately, nobody was\nwatching him—they were leaping to their feet, staring at Dalinar.\n“The Radiants?” Brightness Teshav demanded. “Are you mad? You’re\ngoing to try to rebuild a sect of traitors who gave us over to the\nVoidbringers?”\n“The rest of this sounds good, Father,” Adolin said, stepping forward. “I\nknow you think about the Radiants a lot, but you see them… differently\nthan everyone else. It won’t go well if you announce that you want to\nemulate them.”\nThe king just groaned, burying his face in his hands.\n“People are wrong about them,” Dalinar said. “And even if they are not,\nthe original Radiants—the ones instituted by the Heralds—are something\neven the Vorin church admits were once moral and just. We’ll need to\nremind people that the Knights Radiant, as an order, stood for something"

If they hadn’t, then they wouldn’t have been able to ‘fall’ as the\nstories claim they did.”\n“But why?” Elhokar asked. “What is the point?”\n“It is what I must do.” Dalinar hesitated. “I’m not completely certain\nwhy, yet. Only that I’ve been instructed to do it. As a protection, and a\npreparation, for what is coming. A storm of some sort. Perhaps it is as\nsimple as the other highprinces turning against us. I doubt that, but\nperhaps.”\n“Father,” Adolin said, hand on Dalinar’s arm. “This is all well and good,\nand maybe you can change people’s perception of the Radiants, but…\nIshar’s soul, Father! They could do things we cannot. Simply naming\nsomeone a Radiant won’t give them fanciful powers, like in the stories.”\n“The Radiants were about more than what they could do,” Dalinar said.\n“They were about an ideal. The kind of ideal we’re lacking, these days. We\nmay not be able to reach for the ancient Surgebindings—the powers they\nhad—but we can seek to emulate the Radiants in other ways. I am set on\nthis. Do not try to dissuade me.”\nThe others did not seem convinced.\nKaladin narrowed his eyes. So did Dalinar know about Kaladin’s\npowers, or didn’t he? The meeting moved on to more mundane topics, such\nas how to maneuver Shardbearers into facing Adolin and how to step up\npatrols of the surrounding area. Dalinar considered making the warcamps\nsafe to be a prerequisite for what he was attempting.\nWhen the meeting finally ended, most people inside departing to carry\nout orders, Kaladin was still considering what Dalinar had said about the\nRadiants. The man hadn’t realized it, but he’d been very accurate. The\nKnights Radiant did have ideals—and they’d called them that very thing.\nThe Five Ideals, the Immortal Words.\nLife before death, Kaladin thought, playing with a sphere he’d pulled\nfrom his pocket, strength before weakness, journey before destination.\nThose Words made up the First Ideal in its entirety. He had only an inkling\nof what it meant, but his ignorance hadn’t stopped him from figuring out the\nSecond Ideal of the Windrunners, the oath to protect those who could not\nprotect themselves.\nSyl wouldn’t tell him the other three. She said he would know them\nwhen he needed to. Or he wouldn’t, and would not progress.\nDid he want to progress? To become what? A member of the Knights\nRadiant? Kaladin hadn’t asked for someone else’s ideals to rule his life.\nHe’d just wanted to survive. Now, somehow, he was headed straight down a\npath that no man had trod in centuries. Potentially becoming something that\npeople across Roshar would hate or revere. So much attention…\n“Soldier?” Dalinar asked, stopping by the door.\n“Sir.” Kaladin stood up straight again and saluted. It felt good to do that,\nto stand at attention, to find a place.

He wasn’t certain if it was the good\nfeeling of remembering a life he’d once loved, or if it was the pathetic\nfeeling of an axehound finding its leash again.\n“My nephew was right,” Dalinar said, watching the king retreat down\nthe hallway. “The others might try to hurt my family. It’s how they think.\nI’m going to need guard details on Navani and my sons at all times. Your\nbest men.”\n“I’ve got about two dozen of those, sir,” Kaladin said. “That’s not\nenough for full guard details running all day protecting all four of you. I\nshould have more men trained before too long, but putting a spear in the\nhands of a bridgeman does not make him a soldier, let alone a good\nbodyguard.”\nDalinar nodded, looking troubled. He rubbed his chin.\n“Sir?”\n“Your force isn’t the only one stretched thin in this warcamp, soldier,”\nDalinar said. “I lost a lot of men to Sadeas’s betrayal. Very good men. Now\nI have a deadline. Just over sixty days…”\nKaladin felt a chill. The highprince was taking the number found\nscrawled on his wall very seriously.\n“Captain,” Dalinar said softly, “I need every able-bodied man I can get.\nI need to be training them, rebuilding my army, preparing for the storm. I\nneed them assaulting plateaus, clashing with the Parshendi, to get battle\nexperience.”\nWhat did this have to do with him? “You promised that my men\nwouldn’t be required to fight on plateau runs.”\n“I’ll keep that promise,” Dalinar said. “But there are two hundred and\nfifty soldiers in the King’s Guard. They include some of my last remaining\nbattle-ready officers, and I will need to put them in charge of new recruits.”\n“I’m not just going to have to watch over your family, am I?” Kaladin\nasked, feeling a new weight settling in his shoulders. “You’re implying you\nwant to turn over guarding the king to me as well.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “Slowly, but yes. I need those soldiers. Beyond\nthat, maintaining two separate guard forces seems like a mistake to me. I\nfeel that your men, considering your background, are the least likely to\ninclude spies for my enemies. You should know that a while back, there\nmay have been an attempt on the king’s life. I still haven’t figured out who\nwas behind it, but I worry that some of his guards may have been\ninvolved.”\nKaladin took a deep breath. “What happened?”\n“Elhokar and I hunted a chasmfiend,” Dalinar said. “During that hunt, at\na time of stress, the king’s Plate came close to failing. We found that many\nof the gemstones powering it had likely been replaced with ones that were\nflawed, making them crack under stress.”\n“I don’t know much of Plate, sir,” Kaladin said. “Could they have just\nbroken on their own, without sabotage?”\n“Possible, but unlikely.

At the same time, I’m going to start siphoning off\nthe officers from his guard to train soldiers in my army.\n“Over the next few weeks, we’ll merge your group and the King’s\nGuard into one. You’ll be in charge. Once you’ve trained bridgemen from\nthose other crews well enough, we’ll replace soldiers in the guard with your\nmen, and move the soldiers to my army.” He looked Kaladin in the eyes.\n“Can you do this, soldier?”\n“Yes, sir,” Kaladin said, though part of him was panicking. “I can.”\n“Good.”\n“Sir, a suggestion. You’ve said you’re going to expand patrols outside\nthe warcamps, trying to police the hills around the Shattered Plains?”\n“Yes. The number of bandits out there is embarrassing. This is Alethi\nland now. It needs to follow Alethi laws.”\n“I have a thousand men I need to train,” Kaladin said. “If I could patrol\nthem out there, it might help them feel like soldiers. I could use a large\nenough force that it sends a message to the bandits, maybe making them\nwithdraw—but my men won’t need to see much combat.”\n“Good. General Khal had been in command of patrol duty, but he’s now\nmy most senior commander, and will be needed for other things. Train your\nmen. Our goal will eventually be to have your thousand doing real roadway\npatrols between here, Alethkar, and the ports to the south and east. I’ll want\nscouting teams, watching for signs of bandit camps and searching out\ncaravans that have been attacked. I need numbers on how much activity is\nout there, and just how dangerous it is.”\n“I’ll see to it personally, sir.”\nStorms. How was he going to do all of this?\n“Good,” Dalinar said.\nDalinar walked from the chamber, clasping his hands behind him, as if\nlost in thought. Moash, Eth, and Mart fell in after him, as ordered by\nKaladin. He’d have two men with Dalinar at all times, three if he could\nmanage it. He’d once hoped to expand that to four or five, but storms, with\nso many to watch over now, that was going to be impossible.\nWho is this man? Kaladin thought, watching Dalinar’s retreating form.\nHe ran a good camp. You could judge a man—and Kaladin did—by the\nmen who followed him.\nBut a tyrant could have a good camp with disciplined soldiers. This\nman, Dalinar Kholin, had helped unite Alethkar—and had done so by\nwading through blood. Now… now he spoke like a king, even when the\nking himself was in the room.\nHe wants to rebuild the Knights Radiant, Kaladin thought.

Instead, she wrote descriptions\nsupplemented with sketches.\n“Food…” Pattern said. The sound had a buzzing quality and he vibrated\nwhen he spoke.\n“Yes,” Shallan said. “We eat it.” She selected a small limafruit from the\nbowl beside her and placed it in her mouth, then chewed and swallowed.\n“Eat,” Pattern said. “You… make it… into you.”\n“Yes! Exactly.”\nHe dropped down, the darkness vanishing as he entered the wooden\ndeck of the ship. Once again, he became part of the material—making the\nwood ripple as if it were water. He slid across the floor, then moved up the\nbox beside her to the bowl of small green fruits. Here, he moved across\nthem, each fruit’s rind puckering and rising with the shape of his pattern.\n“Terrible!” he said, the sound vibrating up from the bowl.\n“Terrible?”\n“Destruction!”\n“What? No, it’s how we survive. Everything needs to eat.”\n“Terrible destruction to eat!” He sounded aghast. He retreated from the\nbowl to the deck.\nPattern connects increasingly complex thoughts, Shallan wrote.\nAbstractions come easily to him. Early, he asked me the questions “Why?\nWhy you? Why be?” I interpreted this as asking me my purpose. When I\nreplied, “To find truth,” he easily seemed to grasp my meaning. And yet,\nsome simple realities—such as why people would need to eat—completely\nescape him. It—\nShe stopped writing as the paper puckered and rose, Pattern appearing\non the sheet itself, his tiny ridges lifting the letters she had just penned.\n“Why this?” he asked.\n“To remember.”\n“Remember,” he said, trying the word.\n“It means…” Stormfather. How did she explain memory? “It means to\nbe able to know what you did in the past. In other moments, ones that\nhappened days ago.”\n“Remember,” he said. “I… cannot… remember…”\n“What is the first thing you do remember?” Shallan asked. “Where were\nyou first?”\n“First,” Pattern said. “With you.”\n“On the ship?” Shallan said, writing.\n“No. Green.

It hadn’t really been there in the first place, had it?\nShe raised her safehand to her breast, breathing in and out in sharp gasps.\nNo.\n“Hey, young miss!” Yalb said from behind. “Tell the new kid here what\nhappened in Kharbranth!”\nShallan turned, heart still racing, to see Yalb walking over with the “new\nkid,” a six-foot-tall hulk of a man who was at least five years Yalb’s senior.\nThey’d picked him up at Amydlatn, the last port. Tozbek wanted to be sure\nthey wouldn’t be undermanned during the last leg to New Natanan.\nYalb squatted down beside her stool. In the face of the chill, he’d\nacquiesced to wearing a shirt with ragged sleeves and a kind of headband\nthat wrapped over his ears.\n“Brightness?” Yalb asked. “You all right? You look like you swallowed\na turtle. And not just the head, neither.”\n“I’m well,” Shallan said. “What… what was it you wanted of me,\nagain?”\n“In Kharbranth,” Yalb said, thumbing over his shoulder. “Did we or did\nwe not meet the king?”\n“We?” Shallan asked. “I met him.”\n“And I was your retinue.”\n“You were waiting outside.”\n“Doesn’t matter none,” Yalb said. “I was your footman for that meeting,\neh?”\nFootman? He’d led her up to the palace as a favor. “I… guess,” she said.\n“You did have a nice bow, as I recall.”\n“See,” Yalb said, standing and confronting the much larger man. “I\nmentioned the bow, didn’t I?”\nThe “new kid” rumbled his agreement.\n“So get to washing those dishes,” Yalb said. He got a scowl in response.\n“Now, don’t give me that,” Yalb said. “I told you, galley duty is something\nthe captain watches closely. If you want to fit in around here, you do it well,\nand do some extra. It will put you ahead with the captain and the rest of the\nmen. I’m giving you quite the opportunity here, and I’ll have you appreciate\nit.”\nThat seemed to placate the larger man, who turned around and went\ntromping toward the lower decks.\n“Passions!” Yalb said. “That fellow is as dun as two spheres made of\nmud. I worry about him. Somebody’s going to take advantage of him,\nBrightness.”"

Somebody’s going to take advantage of him,\nBrightness.”\n“Yalb, have you been boasting again?” Shallan said.\n“’Tain’t boasting if some of it’s true.”\n“Actually, that’s exactly what boasting entails.”\n“Hey,” Yalb said, turning toward her. “What were you doing before?\nYou know, with the colors?”\n“Colors?” Shallan said, suddenly cold.\n“Yeah, the deck turned green, eh?” Yalb said. “I swear I saw it. Has to\ndo with that strange spren, does it?”\n“I… I’m trying to determine exactly what kind of spren it is,” Shallan\nsaid, keeping her voice even. “It’s a scholarly matter.”\n“I thought so,” Yalb said, though she’d given him nothing in the way of\nan answer. He raised an affable hand to her, then jogged off.\nShe worried about letting them see Pattern. She’d tried staying in her\ncabin to keep him a secret from the men, but being cooped up had been too\ndifficult for her, and he didn’t respond to her suggestions that he stay out of\ntheir sight. So, during the last four days, she’d been forced to let them see\nwhat she was doing as she studied him.\nThey were understandably discomforted by him, but didn’t say much.\nToday, they were getting the ship ready to sail all night. Thoughts of the\nopen sea at night unsettled her, but that was the cost of sailing this far from\ncivilization. Two days back, they’d even been forced to weather a storm in a\ncove along the coast. Jasnah and Shallan had gone ashore to stay in a\nfortress maintained for the purpose—paying a steep cost to get in—while\nthe sailors had stayed on board.\nThat cove, though not a true port, had at least had a stormwall to help\nshelter the ship. Next highstorm, they wouldn’t even have that. They’d find\na cove and try to ride out the winds, though Tozbek said he’d send Shallan\nand Jasnah ashore to seek shelter in a cavern.\nShe turned back to Pattern, who had shifted into his hovering form. He\nlooked something like the pattern of splintered light thrown on the wall by a\ncrystal chandelier—except he was made of something black instead of light,\nand he was three-dimensional. So… Maybe not much like that at all.\n“Lies,” Pattern said. “Lies from the Yalb.”\n“Yes,” Shallan said with a sigh. “Yalb is far too skilled at persuasion for\nhis own good, sometimes.”\nPattern hummed softly. He seemed pleased.\n“You like lies?” Shallan asked.\n“Good lies,” Pattern said. “That lie. Good lie.”\n“What makes a lie good?” Shallan asked, taking careful notes, recording\nPattern’s exact words.\n“True lies.”\n“Pattern, those two are opposites.”\n“Hmmmm… Light makes shadow. Truth makes lies. Hmmmm.”\nLiespren, Jasnah called them, Shallan wrote. A moniker they don’t like,\napparently. When I Soulcast for the first time, a voice demanded a truth"

I still don’t know what that means, and Jasnah has not been\nforthcoming. She doesn’t seem to know what to make of my experience\neither. I do not think that voice belonged to Pattern, but I cannot say, as he\nseems to have forgotten much about himself.\nShe returned to making a few sketches of Pattern both in his floating\nand flattened forms. Drawing let her mind relax. By the time she was done,\nthere were several half-remembered passages from her research that she\nwanted to quote in her notes.\nShe made her way down the steps belowdecks, Pattern following. He\ndrew looks from the sailors. Sailors were a superstitious lot, and some took\nhim as a bad sign.\nIn her quarters, Pattern moved up the wall beside her, watching without\neyes as she searched for a passage she remembered, which mentioned spren\nthat spoke. Not just windspren and riverspren, which would mimic people\nand make playful comments. Those were a step up from ordinary spren, but\nthere was yet another level of spren, one rarely seen. Spren like Pattern,\nwho had real conversations with people.\nThe Nightwatcher is obviously one of these, Alai wrote, Shallan copying\nthe passage. The records of conversations with her—and she is definitely\nfemale, despite what rural Alethi folktales would have one believe—are\nnumerous and credible. Shubalai herself, intent on providing a firsthand\nscholarly report, visited the Nightwatcher and recorded her story word for\nword…\nShallan went to another reference, and before long got completely lost\nin her studies. A few hours later, she closed a book and set it on the table\nbeside her bed. Her spheres were getting dim; they’d go out soon, and\nwould need to be reinfused with Stormlight. Shallan released a contented\nsigh and leaned back against her bed, her notes from a dozen different\nsources laid out on the floor of her small chamber.\nShe felt… satisfied. Her brothers loved the plan of fixing the Soulcaster\nand returning it, and seemed energized by her suggestion that all was not\nlost. They thought they could last longer, now that a plan was in place.\nShallan’s life was coming together. How long had it been since she’d\njust been able to sit and read? Without worried concern for her house,\nwithout dreading the need to find a way to steal from Jasnah? Even before\nthe terrible sequence of events that had led to her father’s death, she had\nalways been anxious. That had been her life. She’d seen becoming a true\nscholar as something unreachable. Stormfather! She’d seen the next town\nover as being unreachable.\nShe stood up, gathering her sketchbook and flipping through her\npictures of the santhid, including several drawn from the memory of her dip\nin the ocean. She smiled at that, recalling how she’d climbed back up on\ndeck, dripping wet and grinning. The sailors had all obviously thought her\nmad.\nNow she was sailing toward a city on the edge of the world, betrothed to\na powerful Alethi prince, and was free to just learn. She was seeing"

She was seeing\nincredible new sights, sketching them during the days, then reading through\npiles of books in the nights.\nShe had stumbled into the perfect life, and it was everything she’d\nwished for.\nShallan fished in the pocket inside her safehand sleeve, digging out\nsome more spheres to replace those dimming in the goblet. The ones her\nhand emerged with, however, were completely dun. Not a glimmer of Light\nin them.\nShe frowned. These had been restored during the previous highstorm,\nheld in a basket tied to the ship’s mast. The ones in her goblet were two\nstorms old now, which was why they were running out. How had the ones\nin her pocket gone dun faster? It defied reason.\n“Mmmmm…” Pattern said from the wall near her head. “Lies.”\nShallan replaced the spheres in her pocket, then opened the door into the\nship’s narrow companionway and moved to Jasnah’s cabin. It was the cabin\nthat Tozbek and his wife usually shared, but they had vacated it for the third\n—and smallest—of the cabins to give Jasnah the better quarters. People did\nthings like that for her, even when she didn’t ask.\nJasnah would have some spheres for Shallan to use. Indeed, Jasnah’s\ndoor was cracked open, swaying slightly as the ship creaked and rocked\nalong its evening path. Jasnah sat at the desk inside, and Shallan peeked in,\nsuddenly uncertain if she wanted to bother the woman.\nShe could see Jasnah’s face, hand against her temple, staring at the\npages spread before her. Jasnah’s eyes were haunted, her expression\nhaggard.\nThis was not the Jasnah that Shallan was accustomed to seeing. The\nconfidence had been overwhelmed by exhaustion, the poise replaced by\nworry. Jasnah started to write something, but stopped after just a few words.\nShe set down the pen, closing her eyes and massaging her temples. A few\ndizzy-looking spren, like jets of dust rising into the air, appeared around\nJasnah’s head. Exhaustionspren.\nShallan pulled back, suddenly feeling as if she’d intruded upon an\nintimate moment. Jasnah with her defenses down. Shallan began to creep\naway, but a voice from the floor suddenly said, “Truth!”\nStartled, Jasnah looked up, eyes finding Shallan—who, of course,\nblushed furiously.\nJasnah turned her eyes down toward Pattern on the floor, then reset her\nmask, sitting up with proper posture. “Yes, child?”\n“I… I needed spheres…” Shallan said. “Those in my pouch went dun.”\n“Have you been Soulcasting?” Jasnah asked sharply.\n“What? No, Brightness. I promised I would not.”\n“Then it is the second ability,” Jasnah said. “Come in and close that\ndoor. I should speak to Captain Tozbek; it won’t latch properly.”\nShallan stepped in, pushing the door closed, though the latch didn’t\ncatch. She stepped forward, hands clasped, feeling embarrassed.\n“What did you do?” Jasnah asked. “It involved light, I assume?”"

One of the sailors saw the deck turn green, but it vanished when I\nstopped thinking about the plants.”\n“Yes…” Jasnah said. She flipped through one of her books, stopping at\nan illustration. Shallan had seen it before; it was as ancient as Vorinism. Ten\nspheres connected by lines forming a shape like an hourglass on its side.\nTwo of the spheres at the center looked almost like pupils. The Double Eye\nof the Almighty.\n“Ten Essences,” Jasnah said softly. She ran her fingers along the page.\n“Ten Surges. Ten orders. But what does it mean that the spren have finally\ndecided to return the oaths to us? And how much time remains to me? Not\nlong. Not long…”\n“Brightness?” Shallan asked.\n“Before your arrival, I could assume I was an anomaly,” Jasnah said. “I\ncould hope that Surgebindings were not returning in large numbers. I no\nlonger have that hope. The Cryptics sent you to me, of that I have no doubt,\nbecause they knew you would need training. That gives me hope that I was\nat least one of the first.”\n“I don’t understand.”\nJasnah looked up toward Shallan, meeting her eyes with an intense\ngaze. The woman’s eyes were reddened with fatigue. How late was she\nworking? Every night when Shallan turned in, there was still light coming\nfrom under Jasnah’s door.\n“To be honest,” Jasnah said, “I don’t understand either.”\n“Are you all right?” Shallan asked. “Before I entered, you seemed…\ndistressed.”\nJasnah hesitated just briefly. “I have merely been spending too long at\nmy studies.” She turned to one of her trunks, digging out a dark cloth pouch\nfilled with spheres. “Take these. I would suggest that you keep spheres with\nyou at all times, so that your Surgebinding has the opportunity to manifest.”\n“Can you teach me?” Shallan asked, taking the pouch.\n“I don’t know,” Jasnah said. “I will try. On this diagram, one of the\nSurges is known as Illumination, the mastery of light. For now, I would\nprefer you expend your efforts on learning this Surge, as opposed to\nSoulcasting. That is a dangerous art, more so now than it once was.”\nShallan nodded, rising. She hesitated before leaving, however. “Are you\nsure you are well?”\n“Of course.” She said it too quickly. The woman was poised, in control,\nbut also obviously exhausted. The mask was cracked, and Shallan could see\nthe truth.\nShe’s trying to placate me, Shallan realized. Pat me on the head and\nsend me back to bed, like a child awakened by a nightmare.\n“You’re worried,” Shallan said, meeting Jasnah’s eyes.\nThe woman turned away. She pushed a book over something wiggling\non her table—a small purple spren. Fearspren. Only one, true, but still."

Go back to\nyour studies.”\nShallan sat down on the stool beside Jasnah’s desk. The older woman\nlooked back at her, and Shallan could see the mask cracking further.\nAnnoyance as Jasnah drew her lips to a line. Tension in the way she held\nher pen, in a fist.\n“You told me I could be part of this,” Shallan said. “Jasnah, if you’re\nworried about something…”\n“My worry is what it has always been,” Jasnah said, leaning back in her\nchair. “That I will be too late. That I’m incapable of doing anything\nmeaningful to stop what is coming—that I’m trying to stop a highstorm by\nblowing against it really hard.”\n“The Voidbringers,” Shallan said. “The parshmen.”\n“In the past,” Jasnah said, “the Desolation—the coming of the\nVoidbringers—was supposedly always marked by a return of the Heralds to\nprepare mankind. They would train the Knights Radiant, who would\nexperience a rush of new members.”\n“But we captured the Voidbringers,” Shallan said. “And enslaved them.”\nThat was what Jasnah postulated, and Shallan agreed, having seen the\nresearch. “So you think a kind of revolution is coming. That the parshmen\nwill turn against us as they did in the past.”\n“Yes,” Jasnah said, rifling through her notes. “And soon. Your proving\nto be a Surgebinder does not comfort me, as it smacks too much of what\nhappened before. But back then, new knights had teachers to train them,\ngenerations of tradition. We have nothing.”\n“The Voidbringers are captive,” Shallan said, glancing toward Pattern.\nHe rested on the floor, almost invisible, saying nothing. “The parshmen can\nbarely communicate. How could they possibly stage a revolution?”\nJasnah found the sheet of paper she’d been seeking and handed it to\nShallan. Written in Jasnah’s own hand, it was an account by a captain’s wife\nof a plateau assault on the Shattered Plains.\n“Parshendi,” Jasnah said, “can sing in time with one another no matter\nhow far they are separated. They have some ability to communicate that we\ndo not understand. I can only assume that their cousins the parshmen have\nthe same. They may not need to hear a call to action in order to revolt.”\nShallan read the report, nodding slowly. “We need to warn others,\nJasnah.”\n“You don’t think I’ve tried?” Jasnah asked. “I’ve written to scholars and\nkings all around the world. Most dismiss me as paranoid. The evidence you\nreadily accept, others call flimsy.\n“The ardents were my best hope, but their eyes are clouded by the\ninterference of the Hierocracy.

My brother and uncle might believe, and that is why we are\ngoing to them.” She hesitated. “There is another reason we seek the\nShattered Plains. A way to find evidence that might convince everyone.”\n“Urithiru,” Shallan said. “The city you seek?”\nJasnah gave her another curt glance. The ancient city was something\nShallan had first learned about by secretly reading Jasnah’s notes.\n“You still blush too easily when confronted,” Jasnah noted.\n“I’m sorry.”\n“And apologize too easily as well.”\n“I’m… uh, indignant?”\nJasnah smiled, picking up the representation of the Double Eye. She\nstared at it. “There is a secret hidden somewhere on the Shattered Plains. A\nsecret about Urithiru.”\n“You told me the city wasn’t there!”\n“It isn’t. But the path to it may be.” Her lips tightened. “According to\nlegend, only a Knight Radiant could open the way.”\n“Fortunately, we know two of those.”\n“Again, you are not a Radiant, and neither am I. Being able to replicate\nsome of the things they could do may not matter. We don’t have their\ntraditions or knowledge.”\n“We’re talking about the potential end of civilization itself, aren’t we?”\nShallan asked softly.\nJasnah hesitated.\n“The Desolations,” Shallan said. “I know very little, but the legends…”\n“In the aftermath of each one, mankind was broken. Great cities in\nashes, industry smashed. Each time, knowledge and growth were reduced to\nan almost prehistoric state—it took centuries of rebuilding to restore\ncivilization to what it had been before.” She hesitated. “I keep hoping that\nI’m wrong.”\n“Urithiru,” Shallan said. She tried to refrain from just asking questions,\ntrying instead to reason her way to the answer. “You said the city was a kind\nof base or home to the Knights Radiant. I hadn’t heard of it before speaking\nwith you, and so can guess that it’s not commonly referred to in the\nliterature. Perhaps, then, it is one of the things that the Hierocracy\nsuppressed knowledge of?”\n“Very good,” Jasnah said. “Although I think that it had begun to fade\ninto legend even before then, the Hierocracy did not help.”\n“So if it existed before the Hierocracy, and if the pathway to it was\nlocked at the fall of the Radiants… then it might contain records that have\nnot been touched by modern scholars. Unaltered, unchanged lore about the\nVoidbringers and Surgebinding.” Shallan shivered. “That’s why we’re really\ngoing to the Shattered Plains.”\nJasnah smiled through her fatigue. “Very good indeed. My time in the\nPalanaeum was very useful, but also in some ways disappointing. While I\nconfirmed my suspicions about the parshmen, I also found that many of the\ngreat library’s records bore the same signs of tampering as others I’d read.\nThis ‘cleansing’ of history, removing direct references to Urithiru or the\nRadiants because they were embarrassments to Vorinism—it’s infuriating."

Maybe that was wishful\nfancy, but I am not too much a scholar to hope that something like that\nmight be true.”\n“And the parshmen?”\n“We will try to persuade the Alethi to rid themselves of those.”\n“Not an easy task.”\n“A nearly impossible one,” Jasnah said, standing. She began to pack her\nbooks away for the night, putting them in her waterproofed trunk.\n“Parshmen are such perfect slaves. Docile, obedient. Our society has\nbecome far too reliant upon them. The parshmen wouldn’t need to turn\nviolent to throw us into chaos—though I’m certain that is what’s coming—\nthey could simply walk away. It would cause an economic crisis.”\nShe closed the trunk after removing one volume, then turned back to\nShallan. “Convincing everyone of what I say is beyond us without more\nevidence. Even if my brother listens, he doesn’t have the authority to force\nthe highprinces to get rid of their parshmen. And, in all honesty, I fear my\nbrother won’t be brave enough to risk the collapse expelling the parshmen\nmight cause.”\n“But if they turn on us, the collapse will come anyway.”\n“Yes,” Jasnah said. “You know this, and I know it. My mother might\nbelieve it. But the risk of being wrong is so immense that… well, we will\nneed evidence—overwhelming and irrefutable evidence. So we find the\ncity. At all costs, we find that city.”\nShallan nodded.\n“I did not want to lay all of this upon your shoulders, child,” Jasnah\nsaid, sitting back down. “However, I will admit that it is a relief to speak of\nthese things to someone who doesn’t challenge me on every other point.”\n“We’ll do it, Jasnah,” Shallan said. “We’ll travel to the Shattered Plains\nand we’ll find Urithiru. We’ll get the evidence and convince everyone to\nlisten.”\n“Ah, the optimism of youth,” Jasnah said. “That is nice to hear on\noccasion too.” She handed the book to Shallan. “Among the Knights\nRadiant, there was an order known as the Lightweavers. I know precious\nlittle about them, but of all the sources I’ve read, this one has the most\ninformation.”\nShallan took the volume eagerly. Words of Radiance, the title read.\n“Go,” Jasnah said. “Read.”\nShallan glanced at her.\n“I will sleep,” Jasnah promised, a smile creeping to her lips. “And stop\ntrying to mother me. I don’t even let Navani do that.”\nShallan sighed, nodding, and left Jasnah’s quarters. Pattern tagged along\nbehind; he’d spent the entire conversation silent.

Part of her was eager to begin, but she was exhausted, her\neyelids drooping. It really had gotten late. If she started the book now…\nPerhaps better to get a good night’s sleep, then dig refreshed into a new\nday’s studies. She set the book on the small table beside her bed, curled up,\nand let the rocking of the boat coax her to sleep.\nShe awoke to screams, shouts, and smoke.\n7. Open Flame\nI was unprepared for the grief my loss brought\n—like an unexpected rain—breaking from a clear\nsky and crashing down upon me. Gavilar’s death\nyears ago was overwhelming, but this… this\nnearly crushed me.\nFrom the journal of Navani Kholin,\nJesesach 1174\nStill half asleep, Shallan panicked. She scrambled off her cot,\naccidentally slapping the goblet of mostly drained spheres. Though she used\nwax to keep it in place, the swat knocked it free and sent spheres tumbling\nacross her cabin.\nThe scent of smoke was powerful. She ran to her door, disheveled, heart\nthumping. At least she’d fallen asleep in her clothing. She threw open the\ndoor.\nThree men crowded in the passageway outside, holding aloft torches,\ntheir backs to her.\nTorches, sparking with flamespren dancing about the fires. Who brought\nopen flame onto a ship? Shallan stopped in numb confusion.\nThe shouts came from the deck above, and it seemed that the ship\nwasn’t on fire. But who were these men? They carried axes, and were\nfocused on Jasnah’s cabin, which was open.\nFigures moved inside. In a frozen moment of horror, one threw\nsomething to the floor before the others, who stepped aside to make way.\nA body in a thin nightgown, eyes staring sightlessly, blood blossoming\nfrom the breast. Jasnah.\n“Be sure,” one of the men said.\nThe other one knelt and rammed a long, thin knife right into Jasnah’s\nchest. Shallan heard it hit the wood of the floor beneath the body.\nShallan screamed.\nOne of the men spun toward her. “Hey!” It was the blunt-faced, tall\nfellow that Yalb had called the “new kid.” She didn’t recognize the other\nmen.\nSomehow fighting through the terror and disbelief, Shallan slammed her\ndoor and threw the bolt with trembling fingers.\nStormfather! Stormfather! She backed away from the door as something\nheavy hit the other side. They wouldn’t need the axes. A few determined\nsmashes of shoulder to door would bring it down.\nShallan stumbled back against her cot, nearly slipping on the spheres\nrolling to and fro with the ship’s motion. The narrow window near the\nceiling—far too small to fit through—revealed only the dark of night\noutside. Shouts continued above, feet thumping on wood.\nShallan trembled, still numb.

It was a nightmare! It couldn’t be—\n“Mmmm… Fight…”\n“No!” Shallan found herself hyperventilating as the men outside\ncontinued to ram their shoulders against her door. She was not ready for\nthis. She was not prepared.\n“Mmmm…” Pattern said, sounding dissatisfied. “Lies.”\n“I don’t know how to use the lies!” Shallan said. “I haven’t practiced.”\n“Yes. Yes… remember… the time before…”\nThe door crunched. Dared she remember? Could she remember? A\nchild, playing with a shimmering pattern of light…\n“What do I do?” she asked.\n“You need the Light,” Pattern said.\nIt sparked something deep within her memory, something prickled with\nbarbs she dared not touch. She needed Stormlight to fuel the Surgebinding.\nShallan fell to her knees beside her cot and, without knowing exactly\nwhat she was doing, breathed in sharply. Stormlight left the spheres around\nher, pouring into her body, becoming a storm that raged in her veins. The\ncabin went dark, black as a cavern deep beneath the earth.\nThen Light began to rise from her skin like vapors off boiling water. It\nlit the cabin with swimming shadows.\n“Now what?” she demanded.\n“Shape the lie.”\nWhat did that mean? The door crunched again, cracking, a large split\nopening down the center.\nPanicked, Shallan let out a breath. Stormlight streamed from her in a\ncloud; she almost felt as if she could touch it. She could feel its potential.\n“How!” she demanded.\n“Make the truth.”\n“That makes no sense!”\nShallan screamed as the door broke open. New light entered the cabin,\ntorchlight—red and yellow, hostile.\nThe cloud of Light leaped from Shallan, more Stormlight streaming\nfrom her body to join it. It formed a vague upright shape. An illuminated\nblur. It washed past the men through the doorway, waving appendages that\ncould have been arms. Shallan herself, kneeling by the bed, fell into\nshadow.\nThe men’s eyes were drawn to the glowing shape. Then, blessedly, they\nturned and gave chase.\nShallan huddled against the wall, shaking. The cabin was utterly dark.\nAbove, men screamed.\n“Shallan…” Pattern buzzed somewhere in the darkness.\n“Go and look,” she said. “Tell me what is happening up on deck.”\nShe didn’t know if he obeyed, as he made no sound when he moved.\nAfter a few deep breaths, Shallan stood up. Her legs shook, but she stood.\nShe collected herself somewhat. This was terrible, this was awful, but\nnothing, nothing, could compare to what she’d had to do the night her father\ndied. She had survived that. She could survive this.\nThese men, they would be of the same group Kabsal had been from—\nthe assassins Jasnah feared. They had finally gotten her.\nOh, Jasnah…"

What was Shallan going to do about armed men taking\nover the ship? How would she find a way out?\nShe felt her way out into the passageway. There was a little light here,\nfrom torches above on the deck. The yells she heard there grew more\npanicked.\n“Killing,” a voice suddenly said.\nShe jumped, though of course it was only Pattern.\n“What?” Shallan hissed.\n“Dark men killing,” Pattern said. “Sailors tied in ropes. One dead,\nbleeding red. I… I do not understand…”\nOh, Stormfather… Above, the shouting heightened, but there was no\nscramble of boots on the deck, no clanging of weapons. The sailors had\nbeen captured. At least one had been killed.\nIn the darkness, Shallan saw shaking, wiggling forms creep up from the\nwood around her. Fearspren.\n“What of the men who chased after my image?” she asked.\n“Looking in water,” Pattern said.\nSo they thought she’d jumped overboard. Heart thumping, Shallan felt\nher way to Jasnah’s cabin, expecting at any moment to trip over the\nwoman’s corpse on the floor. She didn’t. Had the men dragged it above?\nShallan entered Jasnah’s cabin and closed the door. It wouldn’t latch\nshut, so she pulled a box over to block it.\nShe had to do something. She felt her way to one of Jasnah’s trunks,\nwhich had been thrown open by the men, its contents—clothing—scattered\nabout. In the bottom, Shallan found the hidden drawer and pulled it open.\nLight suddenly bathed the cabin. The spheres were so bright they blinded\nShallan for a moment, and she had to look away.\nPattern vibrated on the floor beside her, form shaking in worry. Shallan\nlooked about. The small cabin was a shambles, clothing on the floor, papers\nstrewn everywhere. The trunk with Jasnah’s books was gone. Too fresh to\nhave soaked in, blood was pooled on the bed. Shallan quickly looked away.\nA shout suddenly sounded above, followed by a thump. The screaming\ngrew louder. She heard Tozbek bellow for the men to spare his wife.\nAlmighty above… the assassins were executing the sailors one at a\ntime. Shallan had to do something. Anything.\nShallan looked back at the spheres in their false bottom, lined with\nblack cloth. “Pattern,” she said, “we’re going to Soulcast the bottom of the\nship and sink it.”\n“What!” His vibrating increased, a buzz of sound. “Humans…\nHumans… Eat water?”\n“We drink it,” Shallan said, “but we cannot breathe it.”\n“Mmmm… Confused…” Pattern said.\n“The captain and the others are captured and being executed. The best\nchance I can give them is chaos.” Shallan placed her hands on the spheres\nand drew in the Light with a sharp breath. She felt afire with it inside of her,\nas if she were going to burst. The Light was a living thing, trying to press\nout through the pores of her skin."

The Light was a living thing, trying to press\nout through the pores of her skin.\n“Show me!” she shouted, far more loudly than she’d intended. That\nStormlight urged her to action. “I’ve Soulcast before. I must do it again!”\nStormlight puffed from her mouth as she spoke, like breath on a cold day.\n“Mmmmm…” Pattern said anxiously. “I will intercede. See.”\n“See what?”\n“See!”\nShadesmar. The last time she’d gone to that place, she’d nearly gotten\nherself killed. Only, it wasn’t a place. Or was it? Did it matter?\nShe reached back through recent memory to the time when she’d last\nSoulcast and accidentally turned a goblet into blood. “I need a truth.”\n“You have given enough,” Pattern said. “Now. See.”\nThe ship vanished.\nEverything… popped. The walls, the furniture, it all shattered into little\nglobes of black glass. Shallan prepared herself to fall into the ocean of those\nglass beads, but instead she dropped onto solid ground.\nShe stood in a place with a black sky and a tiny, distant sun. The ground\nbeneath her reflected light. Obsidian? Each way she turned, the ground was\nmade of that same blackness. Nearby, the spheres—like those that would\nhold Stormlight, but dark and small—bounced to a rest on the ground.\nTrees, like growing crystal, clustered here and there. The limbs were\nspiky and glassy, without leaves. Nearby, little lights hung in the air, flames\nwithout their candles. People, she realized. Those are each a person’s mind,\nreflected here in the Cognitive Realm. Smaller ones were scattered about\nher feet, dozens upon dozens, but so small she almost couldn’t make them\nout. The minds of fish?\nShe turned around and came face-to-face with a creature that had a\nsymbol for a head. Startled, she screamed and jumped back. These things…\nthey had haunted her… they…\nIt was Pattern. He stood tall and willowy, but slightly indistinct,\ntranslucent. The complex pattern of his head, with its sharp lines and\nimpossible geometries, seemed to have no eyes. He stood with hands\nbehind his back, wearing a robe that seemed too stiff to be cloth.\n“Go,” he said. “Choose.”\n“Choose what?” she said, Stormlight escaping her lips.\n“Your ship.”\nHe did not have eyes, but she thought she could follow his gaze toward\none of the little spheres on the glassy ground. She snatched it, and suddenly\nwas given the impression of a ship.\nThe Wind’s Pleasure. A ship that had been cared for, loved. It had\ncarried its passengers well for years and years, owned by Tozbek and his\nfather before him. An old ship, but not ancient, still reliable. A proud ship. It\nmanifested here as a sphere.\nIt could actually think. The ship could think. Or… well, it reflected the\nthoughts of the people who served on it, knew it, thought about it.\n“I need you to change,” Shallan whispered to it, cradling the bead in her"

It was too heavy for its size, as if the entire weight of the ship had\nbeen compressed to this singular bead.\n“No,” the reply came, though it was Pattern who spoke. “No, I cannot. I\nmust serve. I am happy.”\nShallan looked to him.\n“I will intercede,” Pattern repeated. “… Translate. You are not ready.”\nShallan looked back to the bead in her hands. “I have Stormlight. Lots\nof it. I will give it to you.”\n“No!” the reply seemed angry. “I serve.”\nIt really wanted to stay a ship. She could feel it, the pride it took, the\nreinforcement of years of service.\n“They are dying,” she whispered.\n“No!”\n“You can feel them dying. Their blood on your deck. One by one, the\npeople you serve will be cut down.”\nShe could feel it herself, could see it in the ship. They were being\nexecuted. Nearby, one of the floating candle flames vanished. Three of the\neight captives dead, though she did not know which ones.\n“There is only one chance to save them,” Shallan said. “And that is to\nchange.”\n“Change,” Pattern whispered for the ship.\n“If you change, they might escape the evil men who kill,” Shallan\nwhispered. “It is uncertain, but they will have a chance to swim. To do\nsomething. You can do them a last service, Wind’s Pleasure.

She\nheard distant cracks from the physical world as she withdrew so much Light\nfrom the nearby gemstones that they shattered.\nShadesmar vanished.\nShe was back in Jasnah’s cabin.\nThe floor, walls, and ceiling melted into water.\nShallan was plunged into the icy black depths. She thrashed in the\nwater, dress hampering her movements. All around her, objects sank, the\ncommon artifacts of human life.\nFrantic, she searched for the surface. Originally, she’d had some vague\nidea of swimming out and helping untie the sailors, if they were bound.\nNow, however, she found herself desperately even trying to find the way up.\nAs if the darkness itself had come alive, something wrapped around her.\nIt pulled her farther into the deep.\n8.

        "text": "on wood. The distant calls of scouts, shouting back the all-clear.\nThe sounds of a plateau run were familiar to Dalinar. Once, he had\ncraved these sounds. He’d been impatient between runs, longing for the\nchance to strike down Parshendi with his Blade, to win wealth and\nrecognition.\nThat Dalinar had been seeking to cover up his shame—the shame of\nlying slumped in a drunken stupor while his brother fought an assassin.\nThe setting of a plateau run was uniform: bare, jagged rocks, mostly the\nsame dull color as the stone surface they sat on, broken only by the\noccasional cluster of closed rockbuds. Even those, as their name implied,\ncould be mistaken for more rocks. There was nothing but more of the same\nfrom here where you stood, all the way out to the far horizon; and\neverything you’d brought with you, everything human, was dwarfed by the\nvastness of these endless, fractured plains and deadly chasms.\nOver the years, this activity had become rote. Marching beneath that\nwhite sun like molten steel. Crossing gap after gap. Eventually, plateau runs\nhad become less something to anticipate and more a dogged obligation. For\nGavilar and glory, yes, but mainly because they—and the enemy—were\nhere. This was what you did.\nThe scents of a plateau run were the scents of a great stillness: baked\nstone, dried crem, long-traveled winds.\nMost recently, Dalinar was coming to detest plateau runs. They were a\nfrivolity, a waste of life. They weren’t about fulfilling the Vengeance Pact,\nbut about greed. Many gemhearts appeared on the near plateaus, convenient\nto reach. Those didn’t sate the Alethi. They had to reach farther, toward\nassaults that cost dearly.\nAhead, Highprince Aladar’s men fought on a plateau. They had arrived\nbefore Dalinar’s army, and the conflict told a familiar story. Men against\nParshendi, fighting in a sinuous line, each army trying to shove the other\nback. The humans could field far more men than the Parshendi, but the\nParshendi could reach plateaus faster and secure them quickly.\nThe scattered bodies of bridgemen on the staging plateau, leading up to\nthe chasm, attested to the danger of charging an entrenched foe. Dalinar did\nnot miss the dark expressions on his bodyguards’ faces as they surveyed the\ndead. Aladar, like most of the other highprinces, used Sadeas’s philosophy\non bridge runs. Quick, brutal assaults that treated manpower as an\nexpendable resource. It hadn’t always been this way. In the past, bridges\nhad been carried by armored troops, but success bred imitation.\nThe warcamps needed a constant influx of cheap slaves to feed the\nmonster. That meant a growing plague of slavers and bandits roaming the\nUnclaimed Hills, trading in flesh. Another thing I’ll have to change, Dalinar\nthought.\nAladar himself didn’t fight, but had instead set up a command center on\nan adjacent plateau. Dalinar pointed toward the flapping banner, and one of\nhis large mechanical bridges rolled into place. Pulled by chulls and full of\ngears, levers, and cams, the bridges protected the men who worked them."

        "text": "his large mechanical bridges rolled into place. Pulled by chulls and full of\ngears, levers, and cams, the bridges protected the men who worked them.\nThey were also very slow. Dalinar waited with self-disciplined patience as\nthe workers ratcheted the bridge down, spanning the chasm between this\nplateau and the one where Aladar’s banner flew.\nOnce the bridge was in position and locked, his bodyguard—led by one\nof Captain Kaladin’s darkeyed officers—trotted onto it, spears to shoulders.\nDalinar had promised Kaladin his men would not have to fight except to\ndefend him. Once they were across, Dalinar kicked Gallant into motion to\ncross to Aladar’s command plateau. Dalinar felt too light on the stallion’s\nback—the lack of Shardplate. In the many years since he’d obtained his\nsuit, he’d never gone out onto a battlefield without it.\nToday, however, he didn’t ride to battle—not truly. Behind him,\nAdolin’s own personal banner flew, and he led the bulk of Dalinar’s armies\nto assault the plateau where Aladar’s men already fought. Dalinar didn’t\nsend any orders regarding how the assault should go. His son had been\ntrained well, and he was ready to take battlefield command—with General\nKhal at his side, of course, for advice.\nYes, from now on, Adolin would lead the battles.\nDalinar would change the world.\nHe rode toward Aladar’s command tent. This was the first plateau run\nfollowing his proclamation requiring the armies to work together. The fact\nthat Aladar had come as commanded, and Roion had not—even though the\ntarget plateau was closest to Roion’s warcamp—was a victory unto itself. A\nsmall encouragement, but Dalinar would take what he could get.\nHe found Highprince Aladar watching from a small pavilion set up on a\nsecure, raised part of this plateau overlooking the battlefield. A perfect\nlocation for a command post. Aladar was a Shardbearer, though he\ncommonly lent his Plate and Blade to one of his officers during battles,\npreferring to lead tactically from behind the battle lines. A practiced\nShardbearer could mentally command a Blade to not dissolve when he let\ngo of it, though—in an emergency—Aladar could summon it to himself,\nmaking it vanish from the hands of his officer in an eyeblink, then appear in\nhis own hands ten heartbeats later. Lending a Blade required a great deal of\ntrust on both sides.\nDalinar dismounted. His horse, Gallant, glared at the groom who tried\nto take him, and Dalinar patted the horse on the neck. “He’ll be fine on his\nown, son,” he said to the groom. Most common grooms didn’t know what\nto do with one of the Ryshadium anyway.\nTrailed by his bridgeman guards, Dalinar joined Aladar, who stood at\nthe edge of the plateau, overseeing the battlefield ahead and just below.\nSlender and completely bald, the man had skin a darker tan than most\nAlethi. He stood with hands behind his back, and wore a sharp traditional\nuniform with a skirtlike takama, though he wore a modern jacket above it,\ncut to match the takama.\nIt was a style Dalinar had never seen before.

Aladar also wore a thin\nmustache and a tuft of hair beneath his lip, again an unconventional choice.\nAladar was powerful enough, and renowned enough, to make his own\nfashion—and he did so, often setting trends.\n“Dalinar,” Aladar said, nodding to him. “I thought you weren’t going to\nfight on plateau runs any longer.”\n“I’m not,” Dalinar said, nodding toward Adolin’s banner. There, soldiers\nstreamed across Dalinar’s bridges to join the battle. The plateau was small\nenough that many of Aladar’s men had to withdraw to make way,\nsomething they were obviously all too eager to do.\n“You almost lost this day,” Dalinar noted. “It is well that you had\nsupport.” Below, Dalinar’s troops restored order to the battlefield and\npushed against the Parshendi.\n“Perhaps,” Aladar said. “Yet in the past, I was victorious in one out of\nthree assaults. Having support will mean I win a few more, certainly, but\nwill also cost half my earnings. Assuming the king even assigns me any.\nI’m not convinced that I’ll be better off in the long run.”\n“But this way, you lose fewer men,” Dalinar said. “And the total\nwinnings for the entire army will rise. The honor of the—”\n“Don’t talk to me about honor, Dalinar. I can’t pay my soldiers with\nhonor, and I can’t use it to keep the other highprinces from snapping at my\nneck. Your plan favors the weakest among us and undercuts the successful.”\n“Fine,” Dalinar snapped, “honor has no value to you. You will still obey,\nAladar, because your king demands it. That is the only reason you need.\nYou will do as told.”\n“Or?” Aladar said.\n“Ask Yenev.”\nAladar started as if slapped. Ten years back, Highprince Yenev had\nrefused to accept the unification of Alethkar. At Gavilar’s order, Sadeas had\ndueled the man. And killed him.\n“Threats?” Aladar asked.\n“Yes.” Dalinar turned to look the shorter man in the eyes. “I’m done\ncajoling, Aladar. I’m done asking. When you disobey Elhokar, you mock\nmy brother and what he stood for. I will have a unified kingdom.”\n“Amusing,” Aladar said. “Good of you to mention Gavilar, as he didn’t\nbring the kingdom together with honor. He did it with knives in the back\nand soldiers on the field, cutting the heads off any who resisted. Are we\nback to that again, then? Such things don’t sound much like the fine words\nof your precious book.”\nDalinar ground his teeth, turning away to watch the battlefield. His first\ninstinct was to tell Aladar he was an officer under Dalinar’s command, and\ntake the man to task for his tone. Treat him like a recruit in need of\ncorrection.\nBut what if Aladar just ignored him? Would he force the man to obey?\nDalinar didn’t have the troops for it."

He’d come\non this plateau run not to fight, but to talk. To persuade. Navani was right.\nDalinar needed more than brusque words and military commands to save\nthis kingdom. He needed loyalty, not fear.\nBut storms take him, how? What persuading he’d done in life, he’d\naccomplished with a sword in hand and a fist to the face. Gavilar had\nalways been the one with the right words, the one who could make people\nlisten.\nDalinar had no business trying to be a politician.\nHalf the lads on that battlefield probably didn’t think they had any\nbusiness being soldiers, at first, a part of him whispered. You don’t have the\nluxury of being bad at this. Don’t complain. Change.\n“The Parshendi are pushing too hard,” Aladar said to his generals.\n“They want to shove us off the plateau. Tell the men to give a little and let\nthe Parshendi lose their advantage of footing; that will let us surround\nthem.”\nThe generals nodded, one calling out orders.\nDalinar narrowed his eyes at the battlefield, reading it. “No,” he said\nsoftly.\nThe general stopped giving orders. Aladar glanced at Dalinar.\n“The Parshendi are preparing to pull back,” Dalinar said.\n“They certainly don’t act like it.”\n“They want some room to breathe,” Dalinar said, reading the swirl of\ncombat below. “They nearly have the gemheart harvested. They will\ncontinue to push hard, but will break into a quick retreat around the\nchrysalis to buy time for the final harvesting. That’s what you’ll need to\nstop.”\nThe Parshendi surged forward.\n“I took point on this run,” Aladar said. “By your own rules, I get final\nsay over our tactics.”\n“I observe only,” Dalinar said. “I’m not even commanding my own\narmy today. You may choose your tactics, and I will not interfere.”\nAladar considered, then cursed softly. “Assume Dalinar is correct.\nPrepare the men for a withdrawal by the Parshendi. Send a strike team\nforward to secure the chrysalis, which should be almost opened up.”\nThe generals set up the new details, and messengers raced off with the\ntactical orders. Aladar and Dalinar watched, side by side, as the Parshendi\nshoved forward. That singing of theirs hovered over the battlefield.\nThen they pulled back, careful as always to respectfully step over the\nbodies of the dead. Ready for this, the human troops rushed after. Led by\nAdolin in gleaming Plate, a strike force of fresh troops broke through the\nParshendi line and reached the chrysalis. Other human troops poured\nthrough the gap they opened, shoving the Parshendi to the flanks, turning\nthe Parshendi withdrawal into a tactical disaster.\nIn minutes, the Parshendi had abandoned the plateau, jumping away and\nfleeing.\n“Damnation,” Aladar said softly. “I hate that you’re so good at this.”\nDalinar narrowed his eyes, noticing that some of the fleeing Parshendi"

They lingered\nthere, though much of their force continued on away.\nDalinar waved for one of Aladar’s servants to hand him a spyglass, then\nhe raised it, focusing on that group. A figure stood at the edge of the plateau\nout there, a figure in glistening armor.\nThe Parshendi Shardbearer, he thought. The one from the battle at the\nTower. He almost killed me.\nDalinar didn’t remember much from that encounter. He’d been beaten\nnear senseless toward the end of it. This Shardbearer hadn’t participated in\ntoday’s battle. Why? Surely with a Shardbearer, they could have opened the\nchrysalis sooner.\nDalinar felt a disturbing pit inside of him. This one fact, the watching\nShardbearer, changed his understanding of the battle entirely. He thought\nhe’d been able to read what was going on. Now it occurred to him that the\nenemy’s tactics were more opaque than he’d assumed.\n“Are some of them still out there?” Aladar asked. “Watching?”\nDalinar nodded, lowering his spyglass.\n“Have they done that before in any battle you’ve fought?”\nDalinar shook his head.\nAladar mulled for a moment, then gave orders for his men on the\nplateau to remain alert, with scouts posted to watch for a surprise return of\nthe Parshendi.\n“Thank you,” Aladar added, grudgingly, turning to Dalinar. “Your\nadvice proved helpful.”\n“You trusted me when it came to tactics,” Dalinar said, turning to him.\n“Why not try trusting me in what is best for this kingdom?”\nAladar studied him. Behind, soldiers cheered their victory and Adolin\nripped the gemheart free from the chrysalis. Others fanned out to watch for\na return attack, but none came.\n“I wish I could, Dalinar,” Aladar finally said. “But this isn’t about you.\nIt’s about the other highprinces. Maybe I could trust you, but I’ll never trust\nthem. You’re asking me to risk too much of myself. The others would do to\nme what Sadeas did to you on the Tower.”\n“What if I can bring the others around? What if I can prove to you that\nthey’re worthy of trust? What if I can change the direction of this kingdom,\nand this war? Will you follow me then?”\n“No,” Aladar said. “I’m sorry.” He turned away, calling for his horse.\nThe trip back was miserable. They’d won the day, but Aladar kept his\ndistance. How could Dalinar do so many things so right, yet still be unable\nto persuade men like Aladar? And what did it mean that the Parshendi were\nchanging tactics on the battlefield, not committing their Shardbearer? Were\nthey too afraid to lose their Shards?\nWhen, at long last, Dalinar returned to his bunker in the warcamps—\nafter seeing to his men and sending a report to the king—he found an\nunexpected letter waiting for him.\nHe sent for Navani to read him the words.

        "text": "after seeing to his men and sending a report to the king—he found an\nunexpected letter waiting for him.\nHe sent for Navani to read him the words. Dalinar stood waiting in his\nprivate study, staring at the wall that had borne the strange glyphs. Those\nhad been sanded away, the scratches hidden, but the pale patch of stone\nwhispered.\nSixty-two days.\nSixty-two days to come up with an answer. Well, sixty now. Not much\ntime to save a kingdom, to prepare for the worst. The ardents would\ncondemn the prophecy as a prank at best, or blasphemous at worst. To\nforetell the future was forbidden. It was of the Voidbringers. Even games of\nchance were suspect, for they incited men to look for the secrets of what\nwas to come.\nHe believed anyway. For he suspected his own hand had written those\nwords.\nNavani arrived and looked over the letter, then started reading aloud. It\nturned out to be from an old friend who was going to arrive soon on the\nShattered Plains—and who might provide a solution to Dalinar’s problems.\n9. Walking the Grave\nI wish to think that had I not been under\nsorrow’s thumb, I would have seen earlier the\napproaching dangers. Yet in all honesty, I’m not\ncertain anything could have been done.\nFrom the journal of Navani Kholin,\nJesesach 1174\nKaladin led the way down into the chasms, as was his right.\nThey used a rope ladder, as they had in Sadeas’s army. Those ladders\nhad been unsavory things, the ropes frayed and stained with moss, the\nplanks battered by far too many highstorms. Kaladin had never lost a man\nbecause of those storming ladders, but he’d always worried.\nThis one was brand new. He knew that for a fact, as Rind the\nquartermaster had scratched his head at the request, and then had one built\nto Kaladin’s specifications. It was sturdy and well made, like Dalinar’s\narmy itself.\nKaladin reached the bottom with a final hop. Syl floated down and\nlanded on his shoulder as he held up a sphere to survey the chasm bottom.\nThe single sapphire broam was worth more by itself than the entirety of his\nwages as a bridgeman.\nIn Sadeas’s army, the chasms had been a frequent destination for\nbridgemen. Kaladin still didn’t know if the purpose had been to scavenge\nevery possible resource from the Shattered Plains, or if it had really been\nabout finding something menial—and will-breaking—for bridgemen to do\nbetween runs.\nThe chasm bottom here, however, was untouched. There were no paths\ncut through the snarl of stormleavings on the ground, and there were no\nscratched messages or instructions in the lichen on the walls.

        "text": "crem.\nAs he moved forward, Kaladin had to pick his way over all kinds of\ndebris. Broken sticks and logs from trees blown in from across the Plains.\nCracked rockbud shells. Countless tangles of dried vines, twisted through\none another like discarded yarn.\nAnd bodies, of course.\nA lot of corpses ended up in the chasms. Whenever men lost their battle\nto seize a plateau, they had to retreat and leave their dead behind. Storms!\nSadeas often left the corpses behind even if he won—and bridgemen he’d\nleave wounded, abandoned, even if they could have been saved.\nAfter a highstorm, the dead ended up here, in the chasms. And since\nstorms blew westward, toward the warcamps, the bodies washed in this\ndirection. Kaladin found it hard to move without stepping on bones\nentwined in the accumulated foliage on the chasm floor.\nHe picked his way through as respectfully as he could as Rock reached\nthe bottom behind him, uttering a quiet phrase in his native tongue. Kaladin\ncouldn’t tell if it was a curse or a prayer. Syl moved from Kaladin’s\nshoulder, zipping into the air, then streaking in an arc to the ground. There,\nshe formed into what he thought of as her true shape, that of a young\nwoman with a simple dress that frayed to mist just below the knees. She\nperched on a branch and stared at a femur poking up through the moss.\nShe didn’t like violence. He wasn’t certain if, even now, she understood\ndeath. She spoke of it like a child trying to grasp something beyond her.\n“What a mess,” Teft said as he reached the bottom. “Bah! This place\nhasn’t seen any kind of care at all.”\n“It is a grave,” Rock said. “We walk in a grave.”\n“All of the chasms are graves,” Teft said, his voice echoing in the dank\nconfines. “This one’s just a messy grave.”\n“Hard to find death that isn’t messy, Teft,” Kaladin said.\nTeft grunted, then started to greet the new recruits as they reached the\nbottom. Moash and Skar were watching over Dalinar and his sons as they\nattended some lighteyed feast—something that Kaladin was glad to be able\nto avoid. Instead, he’d come with Teft down here.\nThey were joined by the forty bridgemen—two from each reorganized\ncrew—that Teft was training with the hope that they’d make good sergeants\nfor their own crews.\n“Take a good look, lads,” Teft said to them. “This is where we come\nfrom. This is why some call us the order of bone. We’re not going to make\nyou go through everything we did, and be glad! We could have been swept\naway by a highstorm at any moment. Now, with Dalinar Kholin’s\nstormwardens to guide us, we won’t have nearly as much risk—and we’ll\nbe staying close to the exit just in case…”\nKaladin folded his arms, watching Teft instruct as Rock handed practice\nspears to the men. Teft himself carried no spear, and though he was shorter\nthan the bridgemen who gathered around him—wearing simple soldiers’\nuniforms—they seemed thoroughly intimidated."

Teft himself carried no spear, and though he was shorter\nthan the bridgemen who gathered around him—wearing simple soldiers’\nuniforms—they seemed thoroughly intimidated.\nWhat else did you expect? Kaladin thought. They’re bridgemen. A stiff\nbreeze could quell them.\nStill, Teft looked completely in control. Comfortably so. This was right.\nSomething about it was just… right.\nA swarm of small glowing orbs materialized around Kaladin’s head,\nspren the shape of golden spheres that darted this way and that. He started,\nlooking at them. Gloryspren. Storms. He felt as if he hadn’t seen the like in\nyears.\nSyl zipped up into the air and joined them, giggling and spinning around\nKaladin’s head. “Feeling proud of yourself?”\n“Teft,” Kaladin said. “He’s a leader.”\n“Of course he is. You gave him a rank, didn’t you?”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “I didn’t give it to him. He claimed it. Come on.\nLet’s walk.”\nShe nodded, alighting in the air and settling down, her legs crossed at\nthe knees as if she were primly seating herself in an invisible chair. She\ncontinued to hover there, moving exactly in step with him.\n“Giving up all pretense of obeying natural laws again, I see,” he said.\n“Natural laws?” Syl said, finding the concept amusing. “Laws are of\nmen, Kaladin. Nature doesn’t have them!”\n“If I toss something upward, it comes back down.”\n“Except when it doesn’t.”\n“It’s a law.”\n“No,” Syl said, looking upward. “It’s more like… more like an\nagreement among friends.”\nHe looked at her, raising an eyebrow.\n“We have to be consistent,” she said, leaning in conspiratorially. “Or\nwe’ll break your brains.”\nHe snorted, walking around a clump of bones and sticks pierced by a\nspear. Cankered with rust, it looked like a monument.\n“Oh, come on,” Syl said, tossing her hair. “That was worth at least a\nchuckle.”\nKaladin kept walking.\n“A snort is not a chuckle,” Syl said. “I know this because I am\nintelligent and articulate. You should compliment me now.”\n“Dalinar Kholin wants to refound the Knights Radiant.”\n“Yes,” Syl said loftily, hanging in the corner of his vision. “A brilliant\nidea. I wish I’d thought of it.” She grinned triumphantly, then scowled.\n“What?” he said, turning back to her.\n“Has it ever struck you as unfair,” she said, “that spren cannot attract\nspren? I should really have had some gloryspren of my own there.”\n“I have to protect Dalinar,” Kaladin said, ignoring her complaint. “Not\njust him, but his family, maybe the king himself. Even though I failed to\nkeep someone from sneaking into Dalinar’s rooms.” He still couldn’t figure\nout how someone had managed to get in. Unless it hadn’t been a person.\n“Could a spren have made those glyphs on the wall?” Syl had carried a leaf\nonce. She had some physical form, just not much."

She had some physical form, just not much.\n“I don’t know,” she said, glancing to the side. “I’ve seen…”\n“What?”\n“Spren like red lightning,” Syl said softly. “Dangerous spren. Spren I\nhaven’t seen before. I catch them in the distance, on occasion. Stormspren?\nSomething dangerous is coming. About that, the glyphs are right.”\nHe chewed on that for a while, then finally stopped and looked at her.\n“Syl, are there others like me?”\nHer face grew solemn. “Oh.”\n“Oh?”\n“Oh, that question.”\n“You’ve been expecting it, then?”\n“Yeah. Sort of.”\n“So you’ve had plenty of time to think about a good answer,” Kaladin\nsaid, folding his arms and leaning back against a somewhat dry portion of\nthe wall. “That makes me wonder if you’ve come up with a solid\nexplanation or a solid lie.”\n“Lie?” Syl said, aghast. “Kaladin! What do you think I am? A Cryptic?”\n“And what is a Cryptic?”\nSyl, still perched as if on a seat, sat up straight and cocked her head. “I\nactually… I actually have no idea. Huh.”\n“Syl…”\n“I’m serious, Kaladin! I don’t know. I don’t remember.” She grabbed\nher hair, one clump of white translucence in each hand, and pulled\nsideways.\nHe frowned, then pointed. “That…”\n“I saw a woman do it in the market,” Syl said, yanking her hair to the\nsides again. “It means I’m frustrated. I think it’s supposed to hurt. So… ow?\nAnyway, it’s not that I don’t want to tell you what I know. I do! I just… I\ndon’t know what I know.”\n“That doesn’t make sense.”\n“Well, imagine how frustrating it feels!”\nKaladin sighed, then continued along the chasm, passing pools of\nstagnant water clotted with debris. A scattering of enterprising rockbuds\ngrew stunted along one chasm wall. They must not get much light down\nhere.\nHe breathed in deeply the scents of overloaded life. Moss and mold.\nMost of the bodies here were mere bone, though he did steer clear of one\npatch of ground crawling with the red dots of rotspren. Just beside it, a\ngroup of frillblooms wafted their delicate fanlike fronds in the air, and those\ndanced with green specks of lifespren. Life and death shook hands here in\nthe chasms.\nHe explored several of the chasm’s branching paths. It felt odd to not\nknow this area; he’d learned the chasms closest to Sadeas’s camp better\nthan the camp itself. As he walked, the chasm grew deeper and the area\nopened up. He made a few marks on the wall.\nAlong one fork he found a round open area with little debris. He noted\nit, then walked back, marking the wall again before taking another branch.\nEventually, they entered another place where the chasm opened up,\nwidening into a roomy space.\n“Coming here was dangerous,” Syl said."

It was\ndangerous.”\n“Where were you before?”\n“Another place. With lots of spren. I can’t remember well… it had lights\nin the air. Living lights.”\n“Like lifespren.”\n“Yes. And no. Coming here risked death. Without you, without a mind\nborn of this realm, I couldn’t think. Alone, I was just another windspren.”\n“But you’re not windspren,” Kaladin said, kneeling beside a large pool\nof water. “You’re honorspren.”\n“Yes,” Syl said.\nKaladin closed his hand around his sphere, bringing near-darkness to\nthe cavernous space. It was day above, but that crack of sky was distant,\nunreachable.\nMounds of flood-borne refuse fell into shadows that seemed almost to\ngive them flesh again. Heaps of bones took on the semblance of limp arms,\nof corpses piled high. In a moment, Kaladin remembered it. Charging with\na yell toward lines of Parshendi archers. His friends dying on barren\nplateaus, thrashing in their own blood.\nThe thunder of hooves on stone. The incongruous chanting of alien\ntongues. The cries of men both lighteyed and dark. A world that cared\nnothing for bridgemen. They were refuse. Sacrifices to be cast into the\nchasms and carried away by the cleansing floods.\nThis was their true home, these rents in the earth, these places lower\nthan any other. As his eyes adjusted to the dimness, the memories of death\nreceded, though he would never be free of them. He would forever bear\nthose scars upon his memory like the many upon his flesh. Like the ones on\nhis forehead.\nThe pool in front of him glowed a deep violet. He’d noticed it earlier,\nbut in the light of his sphere it had been harder to see. Now, in the dimness,\nthe pool could reveal its eerie radiance.\nSyl landed on the side of the pool, looking like a woman standing on an\nocean’s shore. Kaladin frowned, leaning down to inspect her more closely.\nShe seemed… different. Had her face changed shape?\n“There are others like you,” Syl whispered. “I do not know them, but I\nknow that other spren are trying, in their own way, to reclaim what was\nlost.”\nShe looked to him, and her face now had its familiar form. The fleeting\nchange had been so subtle, Kaladin wasn’t sure if he’d imagined it.\n“I am the only honorspren who has come,” Syl said. “I…” She seemed\nto be stretching to remember. “I was forbidden. I came anyway. To find\nyou.”\n“You knew me?”\n“No. But I knew I’d find you.” She smiled. “I spent the time with my\ncousins, searching.”\n“The windspren.”"

And what we do is important. So\nimportant that I left everything, defying the Stormfather, to come. You saw\nhim. In the storm.”\nThe hair stood up on Kaladin’s arms. He had indeed seen a being in the\nstorm. A face as vast as the sky itself. Whatever the thing was—spren,\nHerald, or god—it had not tempered its storms for Kaladin during that day\nhe’d spent strung up.\n“We are needed, Kaladin,” Syl said softly. She waved for him, and he\nlowered his hand to the shore of the tiny violet ocean glowing softly in the\nchasm. She stepped onto his hand, and he stood up, lifting her.\nShe walked up his fingers and he could actually feel a little weight,\nwhich was unusual. He turned his hand as she stepped up until she was\nperched on one finger, her hands clasped behind her back, meeting his eyes\nas he held that finger up before his face.\n“You,” Syl said. “You’re going to need to become what Dalinar Kholin\nis looking for. Don’t let him search in vain.”\n“They’ll take it from me, Syl,” Kaladin whispered. “They’ll find a way\nto take you from me.”\n“That’s foolishness. You know that it is.”\n“I know it is, but I feel it isn’t. They broke me, Syl. I’m not what you\nthink I am. I’m no Radiant.”\n“That’s not what I saw,” Syl said. “On the battlefield after Sadeas’s\nbetrayal, when men were trapped, abandoned. That day I saw a hero.”\nHe looked into her eyes. She had pupils, though they were created only\nfrom the differing shades of white and blue, like the rest of her. She glowed\nmore softly than the weakest of spheres, but it was enough to light his\nfinger. She smiled, seeming utterly confident in him.\nAt least one of them was.\n“I’ll try,” Kaladin whispered. A promise.\n“Kaladin?” The voice was Rock’s, with his distinctive Horneater accent.\nHe pronounced the name “kal-ah-deen,” instead of the normal “kal-a-din.”\nSyl zipped off Kaladin’s finger, becoming a ribbon of light and flitting\nover to Rock. He showed respect to her in his Horneater way, touching his\nshoulders in turn with one hand, and then raising the hand to his forehead.\nShe giggled; her profound solemnity had become girlish joy in moments.\nSyl might only be a cousin to windspren, but she obviously shared their\nimpish nature.\n“Hey,” Kaladin said, nodding to Rock, and fishing in the pool. He came\nout with an amethyst broam and held it up.

I have promised I will not fix dung\nfor the men, but it is hard, with soldiers being accustomed to food that is not\nmuch better.” He held up the sphere. “I will use him to buy better, eh?”\n“Sure,” Kaladin said.

And now that I am free, I can\ncreate a shrine fitting to you.”\n“A shrine?” Syl said, eyes widening. “Ooooh.”\n“Syl!” Kaladin said. “Stop it. Rock, I saw a good place for the men to\npractice. It’s back a couple of branches. I marked it on the walls.”\n“Yes, we saw this thing,” Rock said. “Teft has led the men there. It is\nstrange.

How did you know this thing would happen?”\n“They were there,” Kaladin said, “in Sadeas’s warcamp, when we were\nassigned to exclusive duty in the chasms. They saw what we did, and have\nheard stories of our training here. By bringing them down here, we’re\ninviting them in, like an initiation.”\nTeft had been having problems getting the former bridgemen to show\ninterest in his training. The old soldier was always sputtering at them in\nannoyance. They’d insisted on remaining with Kaladin rather than going\nfree, so why wouldn’t they learn?\nThey had needed to be invited. Not just with words.\n“Yes, well,” Rock said. “Sigzil sent me. He wishes to know if you are\nready to practice your abilities.”\nKaladin took a deep breath, glancing at Syl, then nodded. “Yes.

That it was night, that she had awakened screaming, and her\nfather was singing her to sleep…\n“The crystals fine will glow sublime, so sleep my baby dear.”\nThey passed Father’s strongbox set into the wall.

There\nwas land nearby, and the surf sounded against it with a low roar. In the other\ndirection stretched only the endless blue sea.\nShe was cold and her head throbbed as if she’d banged it repeatedly\nagainst a wall, but she was alive. Somehow. She raised her hand—rubbing\nat the itchy dried salt on her forehead—and hacked out a ragged cough. Her\nhair stuck to the sides of her face, and her dress was stained from the water\nand the seaweed on the rock.\nHow… ?\nThen she saw it, a large brown shell in the water, almost invisible as it\nmoved toward the horizon.

You refuse to think about things that bother you.\nBut that was how she survived.\nShallan wrapped her arms around herself for warmth on her stone perch\nand stared out over the ocean. She had to face the truth. Jasnah was dead.\nJasnah was dead.\nShallan felt like weeping. A woman so brilliant, so amazing, was just…\ngone. Jasnah had been trying to save everyone, protect the world itself. And\nthey’d killed her for it. The suddenness of what had happened left Shallan\nstunned, and so she sat there, shivering and cold and just staring out at the\nocean. Her mind felt as numb as her feet.\nShelter. She’d need shelter… something. Thoughts of the sailors, of\nJasnah’s research, those were of less immediate concern. Shallan was\nstranded on a stretch of coast that was almost completely uninhabited, in\nlands that froze at night. As she’d been sitting, the tide had slowly\nwithdrawn, and the gap between herself and the shore was not nearly as\nwide as it had been. That was fortunate, as she couldn’t really swim.\nShe forced herself to move, though lifting her limbs was like trying to\nbudge fallen tree trunks. She gritted her teeth and slipped into the water.\nShe could still feel its biting cold. Not completely numb, then.\n“Shallan?” Pattern asked.\n“We can’t sit out here forever,” Shallan said, clinging to the rock and\ngetting all the way down into the water. Her feet brushed rock beneath, and\nso she dared let go, half swimming in a splashing mess as she made her way\ntoward the land.\nShe probably swallowed half the water in the bay as she fought through\nthe frigid waves until she finally was able to walk. Dress and hair\nstreaming, she coughed and stumbled up onto the sandy shore, then fell to\nher knees. The ground here was strewn with seaweed of a dozen different\nvarieties that writhed beneath her feet, pulling away, slimy and slippery.\nCremlings and larger crabs scuttled in every direction, some nearby making\nclicking sounds at her, as if to ward her off.\nShe dully thought it a testament to her exhaustion that she hadn’t even\nconsidered—before leaving the rock—the sea predators she’d read about: a\ndozen different kinds of large crustaceans that were happy to have a leg to"

This stretch of coast was pocketed with numerous beaches and\ninlets. She put off seeking shelter, instead walking for a long time down the\nshoreline. The beach was composed of sand that was coarser than she’d\nexpected. It certainly didn’t match the idyllic stories she’d read, and it\nground unpleasantly against her toes as she walked.

Night was almost\nupon her.\nWith it came the shocking cold, as bad as the worst winter back home.\nHere in the Frostlands, this would be common. Her clothing, which in this\nhumidity hadn’t completely dried despite the hours walking, felt like ice.\nShe did not know how to build a fire, but perhaps she could make one in\nanother way. She fought through her weariness—storms, but she was\nexhausted—and took out a glowing sphere, one of many she’d found in\nJasnah’s trunk.\n“All right,” she whispered. “Let’s do this.” Shadesmar.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. She was learning to interpret his humming. This\nseemed anxious. “Dangerous.”\n“Why?”\n“What is land here is sea there.”\nShallan nodded dully. Wait. Think.\nThat was growing hard, but she forced herself to go over Pattern’s\nwords again. When they’d sailed the ocean, and she’d visited Shadesmar,\nshe’d found obsidian ground beneath her. But in Kharbranth, she’d dropped\ninto that ocean of spheres.\n“So what do we do?” Shallan asked.\n“Go slowly.”\nShallan took a deep, cold breath, then nodded. She tried as she had\nbefore. Slowly, carefully. It was like… like opening her eyes in the\nmorning.\nAwareness of another place consumed her. The nearby trees popped like\nbubbles, beads forming in their place and dropping toward a shifting sea of\nthem below. Shallan felt herself falling.\nShe gasped, then blinked back that awareness, closing her metaphoric\neyes. That place vanished, and in a moment, she was back in the stand of\ntrees.\nPattern hummed nervously.\nShallan set her jaw and tried again. More slowly this time, slipping into\nthat place with its strange sky and not-sun. For a moment, she hovered\nbetween the worlds, Shadesmar overlaying the world around her like a\nshadowy afterimage. Holding between the two was difficult.\nUse the Light, Pattern said. Bring them.\nShallan hesitantly drew the Light into herself. The spheres in the ocean\nbelow moved like a school of fish, surging toward her, clinking together. In\nher exhaustion, Shallan could barely maintain her double state, and she\ngrew woozy, looking down.\nShe held on, somehow."

In\nher exhaustion, Shallan could barely maintain her double state, and she\ngrew woozy, looking down.\nShe held on, somehow.\nPattern stood beside her, in his form with the stiff clothing and a head\nmade of impossible lines, arms clasped behind his back, and hovering as if\nin the air. He was tall and imposing on this side, and she absently noticed\nthat he cast a shadow the wrong way, toward the distant, cold-seeming sun\ninstead of away from it.\n“Good,” he said, his voice a deeper hum here. “Good.” He cocked his\nhead, and though he had no eyes, turned around as if regarding the place. “I\nam from here, yet I remember so little…”\nShallan had a sense that her time was limited. Kneeling, she reached\ndown and felt at the sticks she’d piled to form the place for her fire. She\ncould feel the sticks—but as she looked into this strange realm, her fingers\nalso found one of the glass beads that had surged up beneath her.\nAs she touched it, she noticed something sweeping through the air\nabove her. She cringed, looking up to find large, birdlike creatures circling\naround her in Shadesmar. They were a dark grey and seemed to have no\nspecific shape, their forms blurry.\n“What…”\n“Spren,” Pattern said. “Drawn by you. Your… tiredness?”\n“Exhaustionspren?” she asked, shocked by their size here.\n“Yes.”\nShe shivered, then looked down at the sphere beneath her hand. She was\ndangerously close to falling into Shadesmar completely, and could barely\nsee the impressions of the physical realm around her. Only those beads. She\nfelt as if she would tumble into their sea at any moment.\n“Please,” Shallan said to the sphere. “I need you to become fire.”\nPattern buzzed, speaking with a new voice, interpreting the sphere’s\nwords. “I am a stick,” he said. He sounded satisfied.\n“You could be fire,” Shallan said.\n“I am a stick.”\nThe stick was not particularly eloquent. She supposed that she shouldn’t\nbe surprised.\n“Why don’t you become fire instead?”\n“I am a stick.”\n“How do I make it change?” Shallan asked of Pattern.\n“Mm… I do not know. You must persuade it. Offer it truths, I think?”\nHe sounded agitated. “This place is dangerous for you. For us. Please.\nSpeed.”\nShe looked back at the stick.\n“You want to burn.”\n“I am a stick.”\n“Think how much fun it would be?”\n“I am a stick.”\n“Stormlight,” Shallan said. “You could have it! All that I’m holding.”\nA pause. Finally, “I am a stick.”\n“Sticks need Stormlight. For… things…” Shallan blinked away tears of\nfatigue.\n“I am—”\n“—a stick,” Shallan said. She gripped the sphere, feeling both it and the\nstick in the physical realm, trying to think through another argument. For a\nmoment, she hadn’t felt quite so tired, but it was returning—crashing back\nupon her. Why…\nHer Stormlight was running out."

Why…\nHer Stormlight was running out.\nIt was gone in a moment, drained from her, and she exhaled, slipping\ninto Shadesmar with a sigh, feeling overwhelmed and exhausted.\nShe fell into the sea of spheres. That awful blackness, millions of\nmoving bits, consuming her.\nShe threw herself from Shadesmar.\nThe spheres expanded outward, growing into sticks and rocks and trees,\nrestoring the world as she knew it. She collapsed into her small stand of\ntrees, heart pounding.\nAll grew normal around her. No more distant sun, no more sea of\nspheres. Just frigid cold, a night sky, and biting wind that blew between the\ntrees. The single sphere she’d drained slipped from her fingers, clicking\nagainst the stone ground. She leaned back against Jasnah’s trunk. Her arms\nstill ached from dragging that up the beach to the trees.\nShe huddled there, frightened. “Do you know how to make fire?” she\nasked Pattern. Her teeth chattered. Stormfather. She didn’t feel cold\nanymore, but her teeth were chattering, and her breath was visible as vapor\nin the starlight.\nShe found herself growing drowsy. Maybe she should just sleep, then\ntry to deal with it all in the morning.\n“Change?” Pattern asked. “Offer the change.”\n“I tried.”\n“I know.” His vibrations sounded depressed.\nShallan stared at that pile of sticks, feeling utterly useless. What was it\nJasnah had said? Control is the basis of all true power? Authority and\nstrength are matters of perception? Well, this was a direct refutation of that.\nShallan could imagine herself as grand, could act like a queen, but that\ndidn’t change a thing out here in the wilderness.\nWell, Shallan thought, I’m not going to sit here and freeze to death. I’ll\nat least freeze to death trying to find help.\nShe didn’t move, though. Moving was hard. At least here, huddled by\nthe trunk, she didn’t have to feel the wind so much. Just lying here until\nmorning…\nShe curled into a ball.\nNo. This didn’t seem right. She coughed, then somehow got to her feet.\nShe stumbled away from her not-fire, dug a sphere from her safepouch,\nthen started walking.\nPattern moved at her feet. Those were bloodier now. She left a red trail\non the rock. She couldn’t feel the cuts.\nShe walked and walked.\nAnd walked.\nAnd…\nLight.\nShe didn’t move any more quickly. She couldn’t. But she did keep\ngoing, shambling directly toward that pinprick in the darkness. A numb part\nof her worried that the light was really Nomon, the second moon. That\nshe’d march toward it and fall off the edge of Roshar itself.\nSo she surprised herself by stumbling right into the middle of a small\ngroup of people sitting around a campfire. She blinked, looking from one\nface to another; then—ignoring the sounds they made, for words were\nmeaningless to her in this state—she walked to the campfire and lay down,\ncurled up, and fell asleep.\n* * *\n“Brightness?”"

No, her feet hurt. Her face\nwas nothing compared to that pain.\nIf she slept a little longer, maybe it would fade. At least for that time…\n“B-Brightness?” the voice asked again. “Are you feeling well, yes?”\nThat was a Thaylen accent. Dredged from deep within her, a light\nsurfaced, bringing memories. The ship. Thaylens. The sailors?\nShallan forced her eyes open. The air smelled faintly of smoke from the\nstill-smoldering fire. The sky was a deep violet, brightening as the sun\nbroke the horizon. She’d slept on hard rock, and her body ached.\nShe didn’t recognize the speaker, a portly Thaylen man with a white\nbeard wearing a knit cap and an old suit and vest, patched in a few\ninconspicuous places. He wore his white Thaylen eyebrows tucked up over\nhis ears. Not a sailor. A merchant.\nShallan stifled a groan, sitting up. Then, in a moment of panic, she\nchecked her safehand. One of her fingers had slipped out of the sleeve, and\nshe pulled it back in. The Thaylen’s eyes flicked toward it, but he said\nnothing.\n“You are well, then?” the man asked. He spoke in Alethi. “We were\ngoing to pack to go, you see. Your arrival last night was… unexpected. We\ndid not wish to disturb you, but thought perhaps you would want to wake\nbefore we depart.”\nShallan ran her freehand through her hair, a mess of red locks stuck with\ntwigs. Two other men—tall, hulking, and of Vorin descent—packed up\nblankets and bedrolls. She’d have killed for one of those during the night.\nShe remembered tossing uncomfortably.\nStilling the needs of nature, she turned and was surprised to see three\nlarge chull wagons with cages on the back. Inside were a handful of dirty,\nshirtless men. It took just a moment for it all to click.\nSlavers.\nShe shoved down an initial burst of panic. Slaving was a perfectly legal\nprofession. Most of the time. Only this was the Frostlands, far from the rule\nof any group or nation. Who was to say what was legal here and what was\nnot?\nBe calm, she told herself forcefully. They wouldn’t have awakened you\npolitely if they were planning something like that.\nSelling a Vorin woman of high dahn—which the dress marked her as\nbeing—would be a risky gambit for a slaver. Most owners in civilized lands\nwould require documentation of the slave’s past, and it was rare indeed that\na lighteyes was made a slave, aside from ardents. Usually someone of\nhigher breeding would simply be executed instead. Slavery was a mercy for\nthe lower classes.\n“Brightness?” the slaver asked nervously.\nShe was thinking like a scholar again, to distract herself. She’d need to\nget past that.\n“What is your name?” Shallan asked. She hadn’t intended to make her\nvoice quite so emotionless, but the shock of what she’d seen left her in"

She hadn’t intended to make her\nvoice quite so emotionless, but the shock of what she’d seen left her in\nturmoil.\nThe man stepped back at her tone. “I am Tvlakv, humble merchant.”\n“Slaver,” Shallan said, standing up and pushing her hair back from her\nface.\n“As I said. A merchant.”\nHis two guards watched her as they loaded equipment onto the lead\nwagon. She did not miss the cudgels they carried prominently at their\nwaists. She’d had a sphere in her hand as she walked last night, hadn’t she?\nMemories of that made her feet flare up again. She had to grit her teeth\nagainst the agony as painspren, like orange hands made of sinew, clawed\nout of the ground nearby. She’d need to clean her wounds, but bloodied and\nbruised as they were, she wasn’t going to be walking anywhere anytime\nsoon. Those wagons had seats…\nThey likely stole the sphere from me, she thought. She felt around in her\nsafepouch. The other spheres were still there, but the the sleeve was\nunbuttoned. Had she done that? Had they peeked? She couldn’t suppress a\nblush at the thought.\nThe two guards regarded her hungrily. Tvlakv acted humble, but his\nleering eyes were also very eager. These men were one step from robbing\nher.\nBut if she left them, she’d probably die out here, alone. Stormfather!\nWhat could she do? She felt like sitting down and sobbing. After everything\nthat had happened, now this?\nControl is the basis of all power.\nHow would Jasnah respond to this situation?\nThe answer was simple. She would be Jasnah.\n“I will allow you to assist me,” Shallan said. She somehow kept her\nvoice even, despite the anxious terror she felt inside.\n“… Brightness?” Tvlakv asked.\n“As you can see,” Shallan said, “I am the victim of a shipwreck. My\nservants are lost to me. You and your men will do. I have a trunk. We will\nneed to go fetch it.”\nShe felt like one of the ten fools. Surely he would see through the flimsy\nact. Pretending you had authority was not the same as having it, no matter\nwhat Jasnah said.\n“It would… of course be our privilege to help,” Tvlakv said.\n“Brightness… ?”\n“Davar,” Shallan said, though she took care to soften her voice. Jasnah\nwasn’t condescending. Where other lighteyes, like Shallan’s father, went\nabout with conceited egotism, Jasnah had simply expected people to do as\nshe wished. And they had.\nShe could make this work. She had to.\n“Tradesman Tvlakv,” Shallan said. “I will need to go to the Shattered\nPlains. Do you know the way?”\n“The Shattered Plains?” the man asked, glancing at his guards, one of\nwhom had approached. “We were there a few months ago, but are now\nheading to catch a barge over to Thaylenah. We have completed our trading\nin this area, with no need to return northward.”"

We have completed our trading\nin this area, with no need to return northward.”\n“Ah, but you do have a need to return,” Shallan said, walking toward\none of the wagons. Each step was agony. “To take me.” She glanced\naround, and gratefully noticed Pattern on the side of a wagon, watching.\nShe walked to the front of that wagon, then held out her hand to the other\nguard, who stood nearby.\nHe looked at the hand mutely, scratching his head. Then he looked at\nthe wagon and climbed onto it, reaching down to help her up.\nTvlakv walked over to her. “It will be an expensive trip for us to return\nwithout wares! I have only these slaves I purchased at the Shallow Crypts.\nNot enough to justify the trip back, not yet.”\n“Expensive?” Shallan asked, seating herself, trying to project\namusement. “I assure you, tradesman Tvlakv, the expense is minuscule to\nme. You will be greatly compensated. Now, let us be moving. There are\nimportant people waiting for me at the Shattered Plains.”\n“But Brightness,” Tvlakv said. “You’ve obviously had a difficult time of\nevents recently, yes, that I can see. Let me take you to the Shallow Crypts.\nIt is much closer. You can find rest there and send word to those waiting for\nyou.”\n“Did I ask to be taken to the Shallow Crypts?”\n“But…” He trailed off as she focused her gaze on him.\nShe softened her expression. “I know what I am doing, and thank you\nfor the advice. Now let us be moving.”\nThe three men exchanged befuddled looks, and the slaver took his knit\ncap off, wringing it in his hands. Nearby, a pair of parshmen with marbled\nskin walked into camp. Shallan nearly jumped as they trudged by, carrying\ndried rockbud shells they’d apparently been gathering for fires. Tvlakv gave\nthem no heed.\nParshmen. Voidbringers. Her skin crawled, but she couldn’t worry about\nthem right now. She looked back at the slaver, expecting him to ignore her\norders. However, he nodded. And then, he and his men simply… did as she\nsaid. They hitched up the chulls, the slaver got directions to her trunk, and\nthey started moving without further objection.\nThey might just be going along for now, Shallan told herself, because\nthey want to know what’s in my trunk. More to rob. But when they reached\nit, they heaved it onto the wagon, lashed it in place, and then turned around\nand headed to the north.\nToward the Shattered Plains.\n12.

His deep, bellowing laugh echoed in the chasm. “This time, he\nholds me!”\nSigzil made a notation on his ledger. “Good. Keep hanging on, Rock.”\n“For how long?” Rock asked.\n“Until you fall.”\n“Until I…” The large Horneater frowned, hanging from the stone with\nboth hands. “I do not like this experiment any longer.”\n“Oh, don’t whine,” Kaladin said, folding his arms and leaning on the\nwall beside Rock. Spheres lit the chasm floor around them, with its vines,\ndebris, and blooming plants. “You’re not dropping far.”\n“It is not the drop,” Rock complained. “It is my arms. I am big man, you\nsee.”\n“So it’s a good thing you have big arms to hold you.”\n“It does not work that way, I think,” Rock said, grunting. “And the\nhandhold is not good. And I—”\nThe stone popped free and Rock fell downward. Kaladin grabbed his\narm, steadying him as he caught himself.\n“Twenty seconds,” Sigzil said. “Not very long.”\n“I warned you,” Kaladin said, picking up the fallen stone. “It lasts\nlonger if I use more Stormlight.”\n“I think we need a baseline,” Sigzil said. He fished in his pocket and\npulled out a glowing diamond chip, the smallest denomination of sphere.\n“Take all of the Stormlight from this, put it into the stone, then we’ll hang\nRock from that and see how long he takes to fall.”\nRock groaned. “My poor arms…”\n“Hey, mancha,” Lopen called from farther down the chasm, “at least\nyou’ve got two of them, eh?” The Herdazian was watching to make sure\nnone of the new recruits somehow wandered over and saw what Kaladin\nwas doing. It shouldn’t happen—they were practicing several chasms over\n—but Kaladin wanted someone on guard.\nEventually they’ll all know anyway, Kaladin thought, taking the chip\nfrom Sigzil. Isn’t that what you just promised Syl? That you’d let yourself\nbecome a Radiant?\nKaladin drew in the chip’s Stormlight with a sharp intake of breath, then\ninfused the Light into the stone. He was getting better at that, drawing the\nStormlight into his hand, then using it like luminescent paint to coat the\nbottom of the rock. The Stormlight soaked into the stone, and when he\npressed it against the wall, it stayed there.\nSmoky tendrils of luminescence rose from the stone. “We probably\ndon’t need to make Rock hang from it,” Kaladin said. “If you need a\nbaseline, why not just use how long the stone remains there on its own?”\n“Well, that’s less fun,” Sigzil said. “But very well.” He continued to\nwrite numbers on his ledger.

I need to\nimpress the women. I do not think sticking rocks to walls will be enough.”\n“I think anyone would find that impressive,” Sigzil said. “It defies the\nlaws of nature.”\n“You do not know many Herdazian women, do you?” Lopen asked,\nsighing. “Really, I think we should try again on the flying. It would be the\nbest.”\n“There is something more,” Kaladin said. “Not flying, but still useful.\nI’m not certain I can replicate it.

The rock finally\npopped off the wall, trailing a few final wisps of Stormlight as it hit the\nground. “Well over a minute,” Sigzil said. “I counted eighty-seven\nseconds.” He looked to the rest of them.\n“We were supposed to be counting?” Kaladin asked, glancing at Rock,\nwho shrugged.\nSigzil sighed.\n“Ninety-one seconds,” Lopen called. “You’re welcome.”\nSigzil sat down on a rock, ignoring a few finger bones peeking out of\nthe moss beside him, and made some notations on his ledger. He scowled.\n“Ha!” Rock said, squatting down beside him. “You look like you have\neaten bad eggs. What is problem?”\n“I don’t know what I’m doing, Rock,” Sigzil said. “My master taught\nme to ask questions and find precise answers. But how can I be precise? I\nwould need a clock for the timing, but they are too expensive. Even if we\nhad one, I don’t know how to measure Stormlight!”\n“With chips,” Kaladin said. “The gemstones are precisely weighed\nbefore being encased in glass.”\n“And can they all hold the same amount?” Sigzil asked. “We know that\nuncut gems hold less than cut ones. So is one that was cut better going to\nhold more? Plus, Stormlight fades from a sphere over time. How many days\nhas it been since that chip was infused, and how much Light has it lost since\nthen? Do they all lose the same amount at the same rate? We know too\nlittle. I think perhaps I am wasting your time, sir.”\n“It’s not a waste,” Lopen said, joining them. The one-armed Herdazian\nyawned, sitting down on the rock by Sigzil, forcing the other man over a\nlittle. “We just need to be testing other things, eh?”\n“Like what?” Kaladin said.\n“Well, gancho,” Lopen said. “Can you stick me to the wall?”\n“I… I don’t know,” Kaladin said.\n“Seems like it would be good to know, eh?” Lopen stood up. “Shall we\ntry?”\nKaladin glanced at Sigzil, who shrugged.\nKaladin drew in more Stormlight. The raging tempest filled him, as if it\nwere battering against his skin, a captive trying to find a way out. He drew\nthe Stormlight into his hand and pressed it against the wall, painting the\nstones with luminescence.\nTaking a deep breath, he picked up Lopen—the slender man was\nstartlingly easy to lift, particularly with a measure of Stormlight still inside\nKaladin’s veins. He pressed Lopen against the wall.\nWhen Kaladin dubiously stepped back, the Herdazian remained there,\nstuck to the stone by his uniform, which bunched up under his armpits.\nLopen grinned. “It worked!”\n“This thing could be useful,” Rock said, rubbing at his strangely cut\nHorneater beard. “Yes, this is what we need to test. You are a soldier,\nKaladin. Can you use this in combat?”\nKaladin nodded slowly, a dozen possibilities popping into his head."

Syl had cocked her head, zipping\nover to Kaladin. “Was that a joke?” she asked softly.\n“Yes,” Kaladin said. “A distinctly bad one.”\n“Ah, don’t say that!” Lopen said, still chuckling. “It’s the best one I\nknow—and trust me, I’m an expert on one-armed Herdazian jokes. ‘Lopen,’\nmy mother always says, ‘you must learn these to laugh before others do.\nThen you steal the laughter from them, and have it all for yourself.’ She is a\nvery wise woman.

The head, he is best part of\nchull.”\n“I will trust you two on that,” Kaladin said. “Marginally.” He reached\nup, taking Lopen by the arm as the Stormlight holding him in place began\nto fade. Rock grabbed the man’s waist, and they helped him down.\n“All right,” Kaladin said, instinctively checking the sky for the time,\nthough he couldn’t see the sun through the narrow chasm opening above.\n“Let’s experiment.”\n* * *\nTempest stoked within him, Kaladin dashed across the chasm floor. His\nmovement startled a group of frillblooms, which pulled in frantically, like\nhands closing. Vines trembled on the walls and began to curl upward.\nKaladin’s feet splashed in stagnant water. He leaped over a mound of\ndebris, trailing Stormlight. He was filled with it, pounding with it. That\nmade it easier to use; it wanted to flow. He pushed it into his spear.\nAhead, Lopen, Rock, and Sigzil waited with practice spears. Though\nLopen wasn’t very good—the missing arm was a huge disadvantage—Rock\nmade up for it. The large Horneater would not fight Parshendi and would\nnot kill, but had agreed to spar today, in the name of “experimentation.”\nHe fought very well, and Sigzil was acceptable with the spear. Together\non the battlefield, the three bridgemen might once have given Kaladin\ntrouble.\nTimes changed."

Together\non the battlefield, the three bridgemen might once have given Kaladin\ntrouble.\nTimes changed.\nKaladin tossed his spear sideways at Rock, surprising the Horneater,\nwho had raised his weapon to block. The Stormlight made Kaladin’s spear\nstick to Rock’s, forming a cross. Rock cursed, trying to turn his spear\naround to strike, but in doing so smacked himself on the side with Kaladin’s\nspear.\nAs Lopen’s spear struck, Kaladin pushed it down easily with one hand,\nfilling the tip with Stormlight. The weapon hit the pile of refuse and stuck\nto the wood and bones.\nSigzil’s weapon came in, missing Kaladin’s chest by a wide margin as\nhe stepped aside. Kaladin nudged and infused the weapon with the flat of\nhis hand, shoving it into Lopen’s, which he’d just pulled out of the refuse,\nplastered with moss and bone. The two spears stuck together.\nKaladin slipped between Rock and Sigzil, leaving the three of them in a\njumbled mess, off balance and trying to disentangle their weapons. Kaladin\nsmiled grimly, jogging down to the other end of the chasm. He picked up a\nspear, then turned, dancing from one foot to the other. The Stormlight\nencouraged him to move. Standing still was practically impossible while\nholding so much.\nCome on, come on, he thought. The three others finally got their\nweapons apart as the Stormlight ran out. They formed up to face him again.\nKaladin dashed forward. In the dim light of the chasm, the glow of the\nsmoke rising from him was strong enough to cast shadows that leaped and\nspun. He crashed through pools, the water cold on his unshod feet. He’d\nremoved his boots; he wanted to feel the stone underneath him.\nThis time, the three bridgemen set the butts of their spears on the\nground as if against a charge. Kaladin smiled, then grabbed the top of his\nspear—like theirs, it was a practice one, without a real spearhead—and\ninfused it with Stormlight.\nHe slapped it against Rock’s, intending to yank it out of the Horneater’s\nhands. Rock had other plans, and hauled his spear back with a strength that\ntook Kaladin by surprise. He nearly lost his grip.\nLopen and Sigzil quickly moved to come at him from either side. Nice,\nKaladin thought, proud. He’d taught them formations like that, showing\nthem how to work together on the battlefield.\nAs they drew close, Kaladin let go of his spear and stuck out his leg.\nThe Stormlight flowed out of his bare foot as easily as it did his hands, and\nhe was able to swipe a large glowing arc on the ground. Sigzil stepped in it\nand tripped, his foot sticking to the Light. He tried to stab as he fell, but\nthere was no force behind the blow.\nKaladin slammed his weight against Lopen, whose strike was off-center.\nHe shoved Lopen against the wall, then pulled back, leaving the Herdazian\nstuck to the stone, which Kaladin had infused in the heartbeat they’d been\npressed together.\n“Ah, not again,” Lopen said with a groan."

Kaladin barely had time to smile\nbefore he noticed Rock swinging a log at his head.\nAn entire log. How had Rock lifted that thing? Kaladin threw himself\nout of the way, rolling on the ground and scraping his hand as the log\ncrashed against the floor of the chasm.\nKaladin growled, Stormlight passing between his teeth and rising into\nthe air in front of him. He jumped onto Rock’s log as the Horneater tried to\nlift it again.\nKaladin’s landing slammed the wood back against the ground. He\nleaped toward Rock, and part of him wondered just what he was thinking,\ngetting into a hand-to-hand fight with someone twice his weight. He\nslammed into the Horneater, hurling them both to the ground. They rolled in\nthe moss, Rock twisting to pin Kaladin’s arms. The Horneater obviously\nhad training as a wrestler.\nKaladin poured Stormlight into the ground. It wouldn’t affect or hamper\nhim, he’d found. So, as they rolled, first Rock’s arm stuck to the ground,\nthen his side.\nThe Horneater kept fighting to get Kaladin into a hold. He almost had it,\ntill Kaladin pushed with his legs, rolling both of them so Rock’s other\nelbow touched the ground, where it stuck.\nKaladin tore away, gasping and puffing, losing most of his remaining\nStormlight as he coughed. He leaned up against the wall, mopping sweat\nfrom his face.\n“Ha!” Rock said, stuck to the ground, splayed with arms to the sides. “I\nalmost had you. Slippery as a fifth son, you are!”\n“Storms, Rock,” Kaladin said. “What I wouldn’t do to get you on the\nbattlefield. You are wasted as a cook.”\n“You don’t like the food?” Rock asked, laughing. “I will have to try\nsomething with more grease. This thing will fit you! Grabbing you was like\ntrying to keep my hands on a live lakefish! One that has been covered in\nbutter! Ha!”\nKaladin stepped up to him, squatting down. “You’re a warrior, Rock. I\nsaw it in Teft, and you can say whatever you want, but I see it in you.”\n“I am wrong son to be soldier,” Rock said stubbornly. “It is a thing of\nthe tuanalikina, the fourth son or below. Third son cannot be wasted in\nbattle.”\n“Didn’t stop you from throwing a tree at my head.”\n“Was small tree,” Rock said. “And very hard head.”\nKaladin smiled, then reached down, touching the Stormlight infused\ninto the stone beneath Rock. He hadn’t ever tried to take it back after using\nit in this way. Could he? He closed his eyes and breathed in, trying… yes.\nSome of the tempest within him stoked again. When he opened his eyes,\nRock was free. Kaladin hadn’t been able to take it all back, but some. The\nrest was evaporating into the air.\nHe took Rock by the hand, helping the larger man to his feet. Rock\ndusted himself off."

Rock\ndusted himself off.\n“That was embarrassing,” Sigzil said as Kaladin walked over to free\nhim too. “It’s like we’re children. The Prime’s own eyes have not seen such\na shameful show.”\n“I have a very unfair advantage,” Kaladin said, helping Sigzil to his\nfeet. “Years of training as a soldier, a larger build than you. Oh, and the\nability to emit Stormlight from my fingers.” He patted Sigzil on the\nshoulder. “You did well. This is just a test, like you wanted.”\nA more useful type of test, Kaladin thought.\n“Sure,” Lopen said from behind them. “Just go ahead and leave the\nHerdazian stuck to the wall. The view here is wonderful. Oh, and is that\nslime running down my cheek? A fresh new look for the Lopen, who cannot\nbrush it away, because—have I mentioned?—his hand is stuck to the wall.”\nKaladin smiled, walking over. “You were the one who asked me to stick\nyou to a wall in the first place, Lopen.”\n“My other hand?” Lopen said. “The one that was cut off long ago, eaten\nby a fearsome beast? It is making a rude gesture toward you right now. I\nthought you would wish to know, so that you can prepare to be insulted.”\nHe said it with the same lightheartedness with which he seemed to approach\neverything. He had even joined the bridge crew with a certain crazy\neagerness.\nKaladin let him down.\n“This thing,” Rock said, “it worked well.”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said. Though honestly, he probably could have\ndispatched the three men more easily just by using a spear and the extra\nspeed and strength the Stormlight lent. He didn’t know yet whether that was\nbecause he was unfamiliar with these new powers, but he did think that\nforcing himself to use them had put him in some awkward positions.\nFamiliarity, he thought. I need to know these abilities as well as I know\nmy spear.\nThat meant practice. Lots of practice. Unfortunately, the best way to\npractice was to find someone who matched or bested you in skill, strength,\nand capacity. Considering what he could now do, that was going to be a tall\norder.\nThe three others walked over to dig waterskins from their packs, and\nKaladin noticed a figure standing in the shadows a little ways down the\nchasm. Kaladin stood up, alarmed until Teft emerged into the light of their\nspheres.\n“I thought you were going to be on watch,” Teft growled at Lopen.\n“Too busy being stuck to walls,” Lopen said, raising his waterskin. “I\nthought you had a bunch of greenvines to train?”\n“Drehy has them in hand,” Teft said, picking his way around some\ndebris, joining Kaladin beside the chasm wall. “I don’t know if the lads told\nyou, Kaladin, but bringing that lot down here broke them out of their shells\nsomehow.”\nKaladin nodded.\n“How did you get to know people so well?” Teft asked.\n“It involves a lot of cutting them apart,” Kaladin said, looking down at"

The scrape was gone,\nStormlight having healed the tears in his skin.\nTeft grunted, glancing back at Rock and the other two, who had broken\nout rations. “You ought to put Rock in charge of the new recruits.”\n“He won’t fight.”\n“He just sparred with you,” Teft said. “So maybe he will with them.\nPeople like him more than me. I’m just going to screw this up.”\n“You’ll do a fine job, Teft, I won’t have you saying otherwise. We have\nresources now. No more scrimping for every last sphere. You’ll train those\nlads, and you’ll do it right.”\nTeft sighed, but said no more.\n“You saw what I did.”\n“Aye,” Teft said. “We’ll need to bring down the entire group of twenty\nif we want to give you a proper challenge.”\n“That or find another person like myself,” Kaladin said. “Someone to\nspar with.”\n“Aye,” Teft said again, nodding, as if he hadn’t considered that.\n“There were ten orders of knights, right?” Kaladin asked. “Do you\nknow much of the others?” Teft had been the first one to figure out what\nKaladin could do. He’d known before Kaladin himself had.\n“Not much,” Teft said with a grimace. “I know the orders didn’t always\nget along, despite what the official stories say. We’ll need to see if we can\nfind someone who knows more than I do. I… I kept away. And the people I\nknew who could tell us, they aren’t around any longer.”\nIf Teft had been in a dour mood before, this drove him down even\nfurther. He looked at the ground. He spoke of his past infrequently, but\nKaladin was more and more certain that whoever these people had been,\nthey were dead because of something Teft himself had done.\n“What would you think if you heard that somebody wanted to refound\nthe Knights Radiant?” Kaladin said softly to Teft.\nTeft looked up sharply. “You—”\n“Not me,” Kaladin said, speaking carefully. Dalinar Kholin had let him\nlisten in on the conference, and while Kaladin trusted Teft, there were\ncertain expectations of silence that an officer was required to uphold.\nDalinar is a lighteyes, part of him whispered. He wouldn’t think twice if\nhe were revealing a secret you’d shared with him.\n“Not me,” Kaladin repeated. “What if a king somewhere decided he\nwanted to gather a group of people and name them Knights Radiant?”\n“I’d call him an idiot,” Teft said. “Now, the Radiants weren’t what\npeople say. They weren’t traitors. They just weren’t. But everyone is sure\nthey betrayed us, and you’re not going to change minds quickly. Not unless\nyou can Surgebind to quiet them.” Teft looked Kaladin up and down. “Are\nyou going to do it, lad?”\n“They’d hate me, wouldn’t they?” Kaladin said. He couldn’t help"

He couldn’t help\nnoticing Syl, who walked through the air until she was close, studying him.\n“For what the old Radiants did.” He held up a hand to stop Teft’s objection.\n“What people think they did.”\n“Aye,” Teft said.\nSyl folded her arms, giving Kaladin a look. You promised, that look\nsaid.\n“We’ll have to be careful about how we do it, then,” Kaladin said. “Go\ngather the new recruits. They’ve had enough practice down here for one\nday.”\nTeft nodded, then jogged off to do as ordered. Kaladin gathered his\nspear and the spheres he’d set out to light the sparring, then waved to the\nother three. They packed up their things and began the hike back out.\n“So you’re going to do it,” Syl said, landing on his shoulder.\n“I want to practice more first,” Kaladin said. And get used to the idea.\n“It will be fine, Kaladin.”\n“No. It will be hard. People will hate me, and even if they don’t, I’ll be\nset apart from them. Separated. I’ve accepted that as my lot, though. I’ll\ndeal with it.” Even in Bridge Four, Moash was the only one who didn’t treat\nKaladin like some mythological savior Herald. Him and maybe Rock.\nStill, the other bridgemen hadn’t reacted with the fear he’d once worried\nabout. They might idolize him, but they did not isolate him. It was good\nenough.\nThey reached the rope ladder before Teft and the greenvines, but there\nwas no reason to wait. Kaladin climbed up out of the muggy chasm onto the\nplateau just east of the warcamps. It felt so strange to be able to carry his\nspear and money out of the chasm. Indeed, the soldiers guarding the\napproach to Dalinar’s warcamp didn’t pester him—instead, they saluted and\nstood up straight. It was as crisp a salute as he’d ever gotten, as crisp as the\nones given to a general.\n“They seem proud of you,” Syl said. “They don’t even know you, but\nthey’re proud of you.”\n“They’re darkeyes,” Kaladin said, saluting back. “Probably men who\nwere fighting on the Tower when Sadeas betrayed them.”\n“Stormblessed,” one of them called. “Have you heard the news?”\nCurse the one who told them that nickname, Kaladin thought as Rock\nand the other two caught up to him.\n“No,” Kaladin called. “What news?”\n“A hero has come to the Shattered Plains!” the soldier yelled back.\n“He’s going to meet with Brightlord Kholin, perhaps support him! It’s a\ngood sign. Might help calm things down around here.”\n“What’s this?” Rock called back. “Who?”\nThe soldier said a name.\nKaladin’s heart became ice.\nHe nearly lost his spear from numb fingers.

He dashed through the camp, running toward Dalinar’s\ncommand complex at its center.\nHe didn’t want to believe when he saw the banner hanging in the air\nabove a group of soldiers, probably matched by a much larger group outside\nthe warcamp. Kaladin passed them, drawing cries and stares, questions if\nsomething was wrong.\nHe finally stumbled to a stop outside the short set of steps into Dalinar’s\nbunkered complex of stone buildings. There, standing in front, the\nBlackthorn clasped hands with a tall man.\nSquare-faced and dignified, the newcomer wore a pristine uniform. He\nlaughed, then embraced Dalinar. “Old friend,” he said. “It’s been too long.”\n“Too long by far,” Dalinar agreed. “I’m glad you finally made your way\nhere, after years of promises. I heard you’ve even found yourself a\nShardblade!”\n“Yes,” the newcomer said, pulling back and holding his hand to the side.\n“Taken from an assassin who dared try to kill me on the field of battle.”\nThe Blade appeared. Kaladin stared at the silvery weapon. Etched along\nits length, the Blade was shaped to look like flames in motion, and to\nKaladin it seemed that the weapon was stained red. Names flooded his\nmind: Dallet, Coreb, Reesh… a squad before time, from another life. Men\nKaladin had loved.\nHe looked up and forced himself to see the face of the newcomer. A\nman Kaladin hated, hated beyond any other. A man he had once\nworshipped.\nHighlord Amaram. The man who had stolen Kaladin’s Shardblade,\nbranded his forehead, and sold him into slavery.\nTHE END OF\nPart One\nInterludes\nI-1.

Exile.\nHome.\nShe ripped the helm of the Shardplate from her head, taking a deep\nbreath of cool air. Plate ventilated wonderfully, but even it grew stuffy after\nextended exertions. Other soldiers landed behind her—she had taken some\nfifteen hundred this run. Fortunately, this time they’d arrived well before\nthe humans, and had harvested the gemheart with minimal fighting. Devi\ncarried it; he had earned the privilege by being the one to spot the chrysalis\nfrom afar.\nAlmost she wished it had not been so easy a run. Almost.\nWhere are you, Blackthorn? she thought, looking westward. Why have\nyou not come to face me again?\nShe thought she’d seen him on that run a week or so back, when they’d\nbeen forced off the plateau by his son. Eshonai had not participated in that\nfight; her wounded leg ached, and the jumping from plateau to plateau had\nstressed it, even in Shardplate. Perhaps she should not be going on these\nruns in the first place.\nShe’d wanted to be there in case her strike force grew surrounded, and\nneeded a Shardbearer—even a wounded one—to break them free.

Her leg\nstill hurt, but Plate cushioned it enough. Soon she would have to return to\nthe fighting. Perhaps if she participated directly, the Blackthorn would\nappear again.\nShe needed to speak with him. She felt an urgency to do so blowing\nupon the winds themselves.\nHer soldiers raised hands in farewell as they went their separate ways.\nMany softly sang or hummed a song to the Rhythm of Mourning. These\ndays, few sang to Excitement, or even to Resolve. Step by step, storm by\nstorm, depression claimed her people—the listeners, as they called their\nrace. “Parshendi” was a human term.\nEshonai strode toward the ruins that dominated Narak. After so many\nyears, there wasn’t much left. Ruins of ruins, one might call them. The\nworks of men and listeners alike did not last long before the might of the\nhighstorms.\nThat stone spire ahead, that had probably once been a tower. Over the\ncenturies, it had grown a thick coating of crem from the raging storms. The\nsoft crem had seeped into cracks and filled windows, then slowly hardened.\nThe tower now looked like an enormous stalagmite, rounded point toward\nthe sky, side knobbed with rock that looked as if it had been melted.\nThe spire must have had a strong core to survive the winds so long.\nOther examples of ancient engineering had not fared so well. Eshonai\npassed lumps and mounds, remnants of fallen buildings that had slowly\nbeen consumed by the Shattered Plains. The storms were unpredictable.\nSometimes huge sections of rock would break free from formations, leaving\ngouges and jagged edges. Other times, spires would stand for centuries,\ngrowing—not shrinking—as the winds both weathered and augmented\nthem.\nEshonai had discovered similar ruins in her explorations, such as the\none she’d been on when her people had first encountered humans. Only\nseven years ago, but also an eternity. She had loved those days, exploring a\nwide world that felt infinite. And now…\nNow she spent her life trapped on this one plateau. The wilderness\ncalled to her, sang that she should gather up what things she could carry and\nstrike out. Unfortunately, that was no longer her destiny.\nShe passed into the shadow of a big lump of rock that she always\nimagined might have been a city gate. From what little they’d learned from\ntheir spies over the years, she knew that the Alethi did not understand. They\nmarched over the uneven surface of the plateaus and saw only natural rock,\nnever knowing that they traversed the bones of a city long dead.\nEshonai shivered, and attuned the Rhythm of the Lost. It was a soft\nbeat, yet still violent, with sharp, separated notes. She did not attune it for\nlong. Remembering the fallen was important, but working to protect the\nliving was more so.\nShe attuned Resolve again and entered Narak.

Much of the Shattered Plains had once been populated, but\nthe largest city had been here at the center. So now the ruins of her people\nmade their home in the ruins of a dead city.\nThey had named it Narak—exile—for it was where they had come to be\nseparated from their gods.\nListeners, both malen and femalen, raised hands to her as she passed. So\nfew remained. The humans were relentless in their pursuit of vengeance.\nShe didn’t blame them.\nShe turned toward the Hall of Art. It was nearby, and she hadn’t put in\nan appearance there for days. Inside, soldiers did a laughable job of\npainting.\nEshonai strode among them, still wearing her Shardplate, helm under\nher arm. The long building had no roof—allowing in plenty of light to paint\nby—and the walls were thick with long-hardened crem. Holding thick-\nbristled brushes, the soldiers tried their best to depict the arrangement of\nrockbud flowers on a pedestal at the center. Eshonai did a round of the\nartists, looking at their work. Paper was precious and canvas nonexistent, so\nthey painted on shell.\nThe paintings were awful. Splotches of garish color, off-center petals…\nEshonai paused beside Varanis, one of her lieutenants. He held the brush\ndelicately between armored fingers, a hulking form before an easel. Plates\nof chitin armor grew from his arms, shoulders, chest, even head. They were\nmatched by her own, under her Plate.\n“You are getting better,” Eshonai said to him, speaking to the Rhythm of\nPraise.\nHe looked to her, and hummed softly to Skepticism.\nEshonai chuckled, resting a hand on his shoulder. “It actually looks like\nflowers, Varanis. I mean it.”\n“It looks like muddy water on a brown plateau,” he said. “Maybe with\nsome brown leaves floating in it. Why do colors turn brown when they mix?\nThree beautiful colors put together, and they become the least beautiful\ncolor. It makes no sense, General.”\nGeneral. At times, she felt as awkward in the position as these men did\ntrying to paint pictures. She wore warform, as she needed the armor for\nbattle, but she preferred workform. More limber, more rugged. It wasn’t\nthat she disliked leading these men, but doing the same thing every day—\ndrills, plateau runs—numbed her mind. She wanted to be seeing new things,\ngoing new places. Instead, she joined her people in a long funeral vigil as,\none by one, they died.\nNo. We will find a way out of it.\nThe art was part of that, she hoped. By her order, each man or woman\ntook a turn in the Hall of Art at their appointed time. And they tried; they\ntried hard. So far, it had been about as successful as trying to leap a chasm\nwith the other side out of sight. “No spren?” she asked.\n“Not a one.” He said it to the Rhythm of Mourning. She heard that\nrhythm far too often these days."

She heard that\nrhythm far too often these days.\n“Keep trying,” she said. “We will not lose this battle for lack of effort.”\n“But General,” Varanis said, “what is the point? Having artists won’t\nsave us from the swords of humans.”\nNearby, other soldiers turned to hear her answer.\n“Artists won’t help,” she said to the Rhythm of Peace. “But my sister is\nconfident that she is close to discovering new forms. If we can discover\nhow to create artists, then it might teach her more about the process of\nchange—and that might help her with her research. Help her discover forms\nstronger, even, than warform. Artists won’t get us out of this, but some\nother form might.”\nVaranis nodded. He was a good soldier. Not all of them were—warform\ndid not intrinsically make one more disciplined. Unfortunately, it did\nhamper one’s artistic skill.\nEshonai had tried painting. She couldn’t think the right way, couldn’t\ngrasp the abstraction needed to create art. Warform was a good form,\nversatile. It didn’t impede thought, like mateform did. As with workform,\nyou were yourself when you were warform. But each had its quirks. A\nworker had difficulty committing violence—there was a block in the mind\nsomewhere. That was one of the reasons she liked the form. It forced her to\nthink differently to get around problems.\nNeither form could create art. Not well, at least. Mateform was better,\nbut came with a whole host of other problems. Keeping those types focused\non anything productive was almost impossible. There were two other forms,\nthough the first—dullform—was one they rarely used. It was a relic of the\npast, before they’d rediscovered something better.\nThat left only nimbleform, a general form that was lithe and careful.\nThey used it for nurturing young and doing the kind of work that required\nmore dexterity than brawn. Few could be spared for that form, though it\nwas more skilled at art.\nThe old songs spoke of hundreds of forms. Now they knew of only five.\nWell, six if one counted slaveform, the form with no spren, no soul, and no\nsong. The form the humans were accustomed to, the ones they called\nparshmen. It wasn’t really a form at all, however, but a lack of any form.\nEshonai left the Hall of Art, helm under her arm, leg aching. She passed\nthrough the watering square, where nimbles had crafted a large pool from\nsculpted crem. It caught rain during the riddens of a storm, thick with\nnourishment.

        "text": "A group of three mateforms—two female, one male—played in the\nwater, splashing at one another. Barely clothed, they dripped with what\nothers would be drinking.\n“You three,” Eshonai snapped at them. “Shouldn’t you be doing\nsomething?”\nPlump and vapid, they grinned at Eshonai. “Come in!” one called. “It’s\nfun!”\n“Out,” Eshonai said, pointing.\nThe three muttered to the Rhythm of Irritation as they climbed from the\nwater. Nearby, several workers shook their heads as they passed, one\nsinging to Praise in appreciation of Eshonai. Workers did not like\nconfrontation.\nIt was an excuse. Just as those who took on mateform used their form as\nan excuse for their inane activities. When a worker, Eshonai had trained\nherself to confront when necessary. She’d even been a mate once, and had\nproven to herself firsthand that one could indeed be productive as a mate,\ndespite… distractions.\nOf course, the rest of her experiences as a mate had been an utter\ndisaster.\nShe spoke to Reprimand to the mateforms, her words so passionate that\nshe actually attracted angerspren. She saw them coming from a ways off,\ndrawn by her emotion, moving with an incredible speed—like lightning\ndancing toward her across the distant stone. The lightning pooled at her\nfeet, turning the stones red.\nThat put the fear of the gods into the mateforms, and they ran off to\nreport to the Hall of Art. Hopefully, they wouldn’t end up in an alcove along\nthe way, mating. Her stomach churned at the thought. She had never been\nable to fathom people who wanted to remain in mateform. Most couples, in\norder to have a child, would enter the form and sequester themselves away\nfor a year—then would be out of the form as soon after the child’s birth as\npossible. After all, who would want to go out in public like that?\nThe humans did it. That had baffled her during those early days, when\nshe’d spent time learning their language, trading with them. Not only did\nhumans not change forms, they were always ready to mate, always\ndistracted by sexual urges.\nWhat she wouldn’t have given to be able to go among them unnoticed,\nto adopt their monochrome skin for a year and walk their highways, see\ntheir grand cities. Instead, she and the others had ordered the murder of the\nAlethi king in a desperate gambit to stop the listener gods from returning.\nWell, that had worked—the Alethi king hadn’t been able to put his plan\ninto action. But now, her people were slowly being destroyed as a result.\nShe finally reached the rock formation she called home: a small,\ncollapsed dome. It reminded her of the ones on the edge of the Shattered\nPlains, actually—the enormous ones that the humans called warcamps. Her\npeople had lived in those, before abandoning them for the security of the\nShattered Plains, with its chasms the humans couldn’t jump.\nHer home was much, much smaller, of course. During the early days of\nliving here, Venli had crafted a roof of greatshell carapace and built walls to\ndivide the space into chambers. She’d covered it all over with crem, which"

She’d covered it all over with crem, which\nhad hardened with time, creating something that actually felt like a home\ninstead of a shanty.\nEshonai set her helm on a table just inside, but left the rest of her armor\non. Shardplate just felt right to her. She liked the sensation of strength. It let\nher know that something was still reliable in the world. And with the power\nof Shardplate, she could mostly ignore the wound to her leg.\nShe ducked through a few rooms, nodding to the people she passed.\nVenli’s associates were scholars, though no one knew the proper form for\ntrue scholarship. Nimbleform was their makeshift substitute for now.\nEshonai found her sister beside the window of the farthest chamber. Demid,\nVenli’s once-mate, sat next to her. Venli had held nimbleform for three\nyears, as long as they’d known of the form, though in Eshonai’s mind’s eye\nshe still saw her sister as a worker, with thicker arms and a stouter torso.\nThat was the past. Now, Venli was a slender woman with a thin face, her\nmarblings delicate swirling patterns of red and white. Nimbleform grew\nlong hairstrands, with no carapace helm to block them. Venli’s, a deep red,\nflowed down to her waist, where they were tied in three places. She wore a\nrobe, drawn tight at the waist and showing a hint of breasts at the chest.\nThis was not mateform, so they were small.\nVenli and her once-mate were close, though their time as mates had\nproduced no children. If they’d gone to the battlefield, they’d have been a\nwarpair. Instead, they were a researchpair, or something. The things they\nspent their days doing were very un-listener. That was the point. Eshonai’s\npeople could not afford to be what they had been in the past. The days of\nlounging isolated on these plateaus—singing songs to one another, only\noccasionally fighting—were over.\n“So?” Venli asked to Curiosity.\n“We won,” Eshonai said, leaning back against the wall and folding her\narms with a clink of Shardplate. “The gemheart is ours. We will continue to\neat.”\n“That is well,” Venli said. “And your human?”\n“Dalinar Kholin. He did not come to this battle.”\n“He will not face you again,” Venli said. “You nearly killed him last\ntime.” She said it to the Rhythm of Amusement as she rose, picking up a\npiece of paper—they made it from dried rockbud pulp following a harvest\n—which she handed to her once-mate. Looking it over, he nodded and\nbegan making notes on his own sheet.\nThat paper required precious time and resources to make, but Venli\ninsisted the reward would be worth the effort. She’d better be right.\nVenli regarded Eshonai. She had keen eyes—glassy and dark, like those\nof all listeners. Venli’s always seemed to have an extra depth of secret\nknowledge to them. In the right light, they had a violet cast."

        "text": "of all listeners. Venli’s always seemed to have an extra depth of secret\nknowledge to them. In the right light, they had a violet cast.\n“What would you do, Sister?” Venli asked. “If you and this Kholin were\nactually able to stop trying to kill each other long enough to have a\nconversation?”\n“I’d sue for peace.”\n“We murdered his brother,” Venli said. “We slaughtered King Gavilar\non a night when he’d invited us into his home. That is not something the\nAlethi will forget, or forgive.”\nEshonai unfolded her arms and flexed a gauntleted hand. That night. A\ndesperate plan, made between herself and five others. She had been part of\nit despite her youth, because of her knowledge of the humans. All had voted\nthe same.\nKill the man. Kill him, and risk destruction. For if he had lived to do\nwhat he told them that night, all would have been lost. The others who had\nmade that decision with her were dead now.\n“I have discovered the secret of stormform,” Venli said.\n“What?” Eshonai stood up straight. “You were to be working on a form\nto help! A form for diplomats, or for scholars.”\n“Those will not save us,” Venli said to Amusement. “If we wish to deal\nwith the humans, we will need the ancient powers.”\n“Venli,” Eshonai said, grabbing her sister by the arm. “Our gods!”\nVenli didn’t flinch. “The humans have Surgebinders.”\n“Perhaps not. It could have been an Honorblade.”\n“You fought him. Was it an Honorblade that struck you, wounded your\nleg, sent you limping?”\n“I…” Her leg ached.\n“We don’t know which of the songs are true,” Venli said. Though she\nsaid it to Resolve, she sounded tired, and she drew exhaustionspren. They\ncame with a sound like wind, blowing in through the windows and doors\nlike jets of translucent vapor before becoming stronger, more visible, and\nspinning around her head like swirls of steam.\nMy poor sister. She works herself as hard as the soldiers do.\n“If the Surgebinders have returned,” Venli continued, “we must strive\nfor something meaningful, something that can ensure our freedom. The\nforms of power, Eshonai…” She glanced at Eshonai’s hand, still on her\narm. “At least sit and listen. And stop looming like a mountain.”\nEshonai removed her fingers, but did not sit. Her Shardplate’s weight\nwould break a chair. Instead, she leaned forward, inspecting the table full of\npapers.\nVenli had invented the script herself. They’d learned that concept from\nthe humans—memorizing songs was good, but not perfect, even when you\nhad the rhythms to guide you. Information stored on pages was more\npractical, especially for research.\nEshonai had taught herself the script, but reading was still difficult for\nher. She did not have much time to practice.\n“So… stormform?” Eshonai said.\n“Enough people of that form,” Venli said, “could control a highstorm, or\neven summon one.”\n“I remember the song that speaks of this form,” Eshonai said. “It was a\nthing of the gods.”"

        "text": "even summon one.”\n“I remember the song that speaks of this form,” Eshonai said. “It was a\nthing of the gods.”\n“Most of the forms are related to them in some way,” Venli said. “Can\nwe really trust the accuracy of words first sung so long ago? When those\nsongs were memorized, our people were mostly dullform.”\nIt was a form of low intelligence, low capacity. They used it now to spy\non the humans. Once, it and mateform had been the only forms her people\nhad known.\nDemid shuffled some of the pages, moving a stack. “Venli is right,\nEshonai. This is a risk we must take.”\n“We could negotiate with the Alethi,” Eshonai said.\n“To what end?” Venli said, again to Skepticism, her exhaustionspren\nfinally fading, the spren spinning away to search out more fresh sources of\nemotion. “Eshonai, you keep saying you want to negotiate. I think it is\nbecause you are fascinated by humans. You think they’ll let you go freely\namong them? A person they see as having the form of a rebellious slave?”\n“Centuries ago,” Demid said, “we escaped both our gods and the\nhumans. Our ancestors left behind civilization, power, and might in order to\nsecure freedom. I would not give that up, Eshonai. Stormform. With it, we\ncan destroy the Alethi army.”\n“With them gone,” Venli said, “you can return to exploration. No\nresponsibility—you could travel, make your maps, discover places no\nperson has ever seen.”\n“What I want for myself is meaningless,” Eshonai said to Reprimand,\n“so long as we are all in danger of destruction.” She scanned the specks on\nthe page, scribbles of songs. Songs without music, written out as they were.\nTheir souls stripped away.\nCould the listeners’ salvation really be in something so terrible? Venli\nand her team had spent five years recording all of the songs, learning the\nnuances from the elderly, capturing them in these pages. Through\ncollaboration, research, and deep thought, they had discovered nimbleform.\n“It is the only way,” Venli said to Peace. “We will bring this to the Five,\nEshonai. I would have you on our side.”\n“I… I will consider.”\nI-2. Ym\nYm carefully trimmed the wood from the side of the small block. He\nheld it up to the spherelight beside his bench, pinching his spectacles by the\nrim and holding them closer to his eyes.\nSuch delightful inventions, spectacles. To live was to be a fragment of\nthe cosmere that was experiencing itself. How could he properly experience\nif he couldn’t see? The Azish man who had first created these devices was\nlong deceased, and Ym had submitted a proposal that he be considered one\nof the Honored Dead.\nYm lowered the piece of wood and continued to carve it, carefully\nwhittling off the front to form a curve. Some of his colleagues bought their\nlasts—the wooden forms around which a cobbler built his shoes—from\ncarpenters, but Ym had been taught to make his own.

        "text": "carpenters, but Ym had been taught to make his own. That was the old way,\nthe way it had been done for centuries. If something had been done one way\nfor such a long time, he figured there was probably a good reason.\nBehind him stood the shadowed cubbies of a cobbler’s shop, the toes of\ndozens of shoes peeking out like the noses of eels in their holes. These were\ntest shoes, used to judge size, choose materials, and decide styles so he\ncould construct the perfect shoe to fit the foot and character of the\nindividual. A fitting could take quite a while, assuming you did it properly.\nSomething moved in the dimness to his right. Ym glanced in that\ndirection, but didn’t change his posture. The spren had been coming more\noften lately—specks of light, like those from a piece of crystal suspended in\na sunbeam. He did not know its type, as he had never seen one like it\nbefore.\nIt moved across the surface of the workbench, slinking closer. When it\nstopped, light crept upward from it, like small plants growing or climbing\nfrom their burrows. When it moved again, those withdrew.\nYm returned to his sculpting. “It will be for making a shoe.”\nThe evening shop was quiet save for the scraping of his knife on wood.\n“Sh-shoe… ?” a voice asked. Like that of a young woman, soft, with a\nkind of chiming musicality to it.\n“Yes, my friend,” he said. “A shoe for young children. I find myself in\nneed of those more and more these days.”\n“Shoe,” the spren said. “For ch-children. Little people.”\nYm brushed wooden scraps off the bench for later sweeping, then set\nthe last on the bench near the spren. It shied away, like a reflection off a\nmirror—translucent, really just a shimmer of light.\nHe withdrew his hand and waited. The spren inched forward—tentative,\nlike a cremling creeping out of its crack after a storm. It stopped, and light\ngrew upward from it in the shape of tiny sprouts. Such an odd sight.\n“You are an interesting experience, my friend,” Ym said as the shimmer\nof light moved onto the last itself. “One in which I am honored to\nparticipate.”\n“I…” the spren said. “I…” The spren’s form shook suddenly, then grew\nmore intense, like light being focused. “He comes.”\nYm stood up, suddenly anxious. Something moved on the street outside.\nWas it that one? That watcher, in the military coat?\nBut no, it was just a child, peering in through the open door. Ym smiled,\nopening his drawer of spheres and letting more light into the room. The\nchild shied back, just as the spren had.\nThe spren had vanished somewhere. It did that when others drew near.\n“No need to fear,” Ym said, settling back down on his stool. “Come in.\nLet me get a look at you.”\nThe dirty young urchin peered back in. He wore only a ragged pair of\ntrousers, no shirt, though that was common here in Iri, where both days and\nnights were usually warm.\nThe poor child’s feet were dirty and scraped."

Come, young one, settle down. Let’s\nget something on those feet.” He moved out one of his smaller stools.\n“They say you don’t charge nothin’,” the boy said, not moving.\n“They are quite wrong,” Ym said. “But I think you will find my cost\nbearable.”\n“Don’t have no spheres.”\n“No spheres are needed. Your payment will be your story. Your\nexperiences. I would hear them.”\n“They said you was strange,” the boy said, finally walking into the\nshop.\n“They were right,” Ym said, patting the stool.\nThe urchin stepped timidly up to the stool, walking with a limp he tried\nto hide. He was Iriali, though the grime darkened his skin and hair, both of\nwhich were golden. The skin less so—you needed the light to see it right—\nbut the hair certainly. It was the mark of their people.\nYm motioned for the child to raise his good foot, then got out a\nwashcloth, wetted it, and cleaned away the grime. He wasn’t about to do a\nfitting on feet so dirty. Noticeably, the boy tucked back the foot he’d limped\non, as if trying to hide that it had a rag wrapped around it.\n“So,” Ym said, “your story?”\n“You’re old,” the boy said. “Older than anyone I know. Grandpa old.\nYou must know everythin’ already. Why do you want to hear from me?”\n“It is one of my quirks,” Ym said. “Come now. Let’s hear it.”\nThe boy huffed, but talked. Briefly. That wasn’t uncommon. He wanted\nto hold his story to himself. Slowly, with careful questions, Ym pried the\nstory free. The boy was the son of a whore, and had been kicked out as soon\nas he could fend for himself. That had been three years ago, the boy\nthought. He was probably eight now.\nAs he listened, Ym cleaned the first foot, then clipped and filed the\nnails. Once done, he motioned for the other foot.\nThe boy reluctantly lifted it up. Ym undid the rag, and found a nasty cut\non the bottom of that foot. It was already infected, crawling with rotspren,\ntiny motes of red.\nYm hesitated.\n“Needed to get some shoes,” the urchin said, looking the other way.\n“Can’t keep on without ’em.”\nThe rip in the skin was jagged. Done climbing over a fence, perhaps?\nYm thought.\nThe boy looked at him, feigning nonchalance. A wound like this would\nslow an urchin down terribly, which on the streets could easily mean death.\nYm knew that all too well.\nHe looked up at the boy, noting the shadow of worry in those little eyes.\nThe infection had spread up the leg.\n“My friend,” Ym whispered, “I believe I am going to need your help.”\n“What?” the urchin said.\n“Nothing,” Ym replied, reaching into the drawer of his table.

The light\nspilling out was just from five diamond chips. Every urchin who had come\nto him had seen those. So far, Ym had been robbed of them only twice.\nHe dug more deeply, unfolding a hidden compartment in the drawer and\ntaking a more powerful sphere—a broam—from there, covering its light\nquickly in his hand while reaching for some antiseptic with the other hand.\nThe medicine wasn’t going to be enough, not with the boy unable to\nstay off his feet. Lying in bed for weeks to heal, constantly applying\nexpensive medication? Impossible for an urchin fighting for food each day.\nYm brought his hands back, sphere tucked inside of one. Poor child. It\nmust hurt something fierce. The boy probably ought to have been laid out in\nbed, feverish, but every urchin knew to chew ridgebark to stay alert and\nawake longer than they should.\nNearby, the sparkling light spren peeked out from underneath a stack of\nleather squares. Ym applied the medication, then set it aside and lifted the\nboy’s foot, humming softly.\nThe glow in Ym’s other hand vanished.\nThe rotspren fled from the wound.\nWhen Ym removed his hand, the cut had scabbed over, the color\nreturning to normal, the signs of infection gone. So far, Ym had used this\nability only a handful of times, and had always disguised it as medicine. It\nwas unlike anything he had ever heard of. Perhaps that was why he had\nbeen given it—so the cosmere could experience it.\n“Hey,” the boy said, “that feels a lot better.”\n“I’m glad,” Ym said, returning the sphere and the medicine to his\ndrawer. The spren had retreated. “Let us see if I have something that fits\nyou.”\nHe began fitting shoes. Normally, after fitting, he’d send the patron\naway and craft a perfect set of shoes just for them. For this child,\nunfortunately, he’d have to use shoes he’d already made. He’d had too\nmany urchins never return for their pair of shoes, leaving him to fret and\nwonder. Had something happened to them? Had they simply forgotten? Or\nhad their natural suspicion gotten the better of them?\nFortunately, he had several good, sturdy pairs that might fit this boy. I\nneed more treated hogshide, he thought, making a note. Children would not\nproperly care for shoes. He needed leather that would age well even if\nunattended.\n“You’re really gonna give me a pair of shoes,” the urchin said. “For\nnothin’?”\n“Nothing but your story,” Ym said, slipping another testing shoe onto\nthe boy’s foot. He’d given up on trying to train urchins to wear socks.\n“Why?”\n“Because,” Ym said, “you and I are One.”\n“One what?”\n“One being,” Ym said. He set aside that shoe and got out another. “Long\nago, there was only One. One knew everything, but had experienced\nnothing. And so, One became many—us, people. The One, who is both\nmale and female, did so to experience all things.”"

The One, who is both\nmale and female, did so to experience all things.”\n“One. You mean God?”\n“If you wish to say it that way,” Ym said. “But it is not completely true.\nI accept no god. You should accept no god. We are Iriali, and part of the\nLong Trail, of which this is the Fourth Land.”\n“You sound like a priest.”\n“Accept no priests either,” Ym said. “Those are from other lands, come\nto preach to us. Iriali need no preaching, only experience. As each\nexperience is different, it brings completeness. Eventually, all will be\ngathered back in—when the Seventh Land is attained—and we will once\nagain become One.”\n“So you an’ me…” the urchin said. “Are the same?”\n“Yes. Two minds of a single being experiencing different lives.”\n“That’s stupid.”\n“It is simply a matter of perspective,” Ym said, dusting the boy’s feet\nwith powder and slipping back on a pair of the test shoes. “Please walk on\nthose for a moment.”\nThe boy gave him a strange look, but obeyed, trying a few steps. He\ndidn’t limp any longer.\n“Perspective,” Ym said, holding up his hand and wiggling his fingers.\n“From very close up, the fingers on a hand might seem individual and\nalone. Indeed, the thumb might think it has very little in common with the\npinky. But with proper perspective, it is realized that the fingers are part of\nsomething much larger. That, indeed, they are One.”\nThe urchin frowned. Some of that had probably been beyond him. I\nneed to speak more simply, and—\n“Why do you get to be the finger with the expensive ring,” the boy said,\npacing back the other direction, “while I gotta be the pinky with the broken\nfingernail?”\nYm smiled. “I know it sounds unfair, but there can be no unfairness, as\nwe are all the same in the end. Besides, I didn’t always have this shop.”\n“You didn’t?”\n“No. I think you’d be surprised at where I came from. Please sit back\ndown.”\nThe boy settled down. “That medicine works real well. Real, real well.”\nYm slipped off the shoes, using the powder—which had rubbed off in\nplaces—to judge how the shoe fit. He fished out a pair of premade shoes,\nthen worked at them for a moment, flexing them in his hands. He’d want a\ncushion on the bottom for the wounded foot, but something that would tear\noff after a few weeks, once the wound was healed…\n“The things you’re talking about,” the boy said. “They sound dumb to\nme. I mean, if we’re all the same person, shouldn’t everyone know this\nalready?”\n“As One, we knew truth,” Ym said, “but as many, we need ignorance.\nWe exist in variety to experience all kinds of thought. That means some of\nus must know and others must not—just like some must be rich, and others\nmust be poor.” He worked the shoe a moment longer. “More people did"

He did stop at\nthe doorway, though.\n“If we’re all just the same person trying out different lives,” the boy\nsaid, “you don’t need to give away shoes. ’Cuz it don’t matter.”\n“You wouldn’t hit yourself in the face, would you? If I make your life\nbetter, I make my own better.”\n“That’s crazy talk,” the boy said. “I think you’re just a nice person.” He\nducked out, not speaking another word.\nYm smiled, shaking his head. Eventually, he went back to work on his\nlast. The spren peeked out again.\n“Thank you,” Ym said. “For your help.” He didn’t know why he could\ndo what he did, but he knew the spren was involved.\n“He’s still here,” the spren whispered.\nYm looked up toward the doorway out onto the night street. The urchin\nwas there?\nSomething rustled behind Ym.\nHe jumped, spinning. The workroom was a place of dark corners and\ncubbies. Had he perhaps heard a rat?\nWhy was the door into the back room—where Ym slept—open? He\nusually left that closed.\nA shadow moved in the blackness back there.\n“If you’ve come for the spheres,” Ym said, trembling, “I have only the\nfive chips here.”\nMore rustling. The shadow separated itself from the darkness, resolving\ninto a man with dark, Makabaki skin—all save for a pale crescent on his\ncheek. He wore black and silver, a uniform, but not one from any military\nthat Ym recognized. Thick gloves, with stiff cuffs at the back.\n“I had to look very hard,” the man said, “to discover your indiscretion.”\n“I…” Ym stammered. “Just… five chips…”\n“You have lived a clean life, since your youth as a carouser,” the man\nsaid, his voice even. “A young man of means who drank and partied away\nwhat his parents left him.

He spoke with such a stark\nlack of emotion, he could have been conversing about the weather.\n“I didn’t know…” Ym pled.\n“You are guilty nonetheless.” The man reached his hand to the side, and\na weapon formed from mist there, then fell into his hand.\nA Shardblade? What kind of constable of the law was this? Ym stared at\nthat wondrous, silvery Blade.\nThen he ran.\nIt appeared that he still had useful instincts from his time on the streets.\nHe managed to fling a stack of leather toward the man and duck the Blade\nas it swung for him. Ym scrambled out onto the dark street and charged\naway, shouting. Perhaps someone would hear. Perhaps someone would\nhelp.\nNobody heard.\nNobody helped.\nYm was an old man now. By the time he reached the first cross street,\nhe was gasping for air. He stopped beside the old barber shop, dark inside,\ndoor locked. The little spren moved along beside him, a shimmering light\nthat sprayed outward in a circle. Beautiful.\n“I guess,” Ym said, panting, “it is… my time. May One… find this\nmemory… pleasing.”\nFootsteps slapped on the street behind, getting closer.\n“No,” the spren whispered. “Light!”\nYm dug in his pocket and pulled out a sphere. Could he use it,\nsomehow, to—\nThe constable’s shoulder slammed Ym against the wall of the barber\nshop. Ym groaned, dropping the sphere.\nThe man in silver spun him around. He looked like a shade in the night,\na silhouette against the black sky.\n“It was forty years ago,” Ym whispered.\n“Justice does not expire.”\nThe man shoved the Shardblade through Ym’s chest.\nExperience ended.\nI-3. Rysn\nRysn liked to pretend that her pot of Shin grass was not stupid, but\nmerely contemplative. She sat near the prow of her catamaran, holding the\npot in her lap. The otherwise still surface of the Reshi Sea rippled from the\npaddling of the guide behind her. The warm, damp air made beads of sweat\nform on Rysn’s brow and neck.\nIt was probably going to rain again. Precipitation here on the sea was\nthe worst kind—not mighty or impressive like a highstorm, not even\ninsistent like an ordinary shower. Here, it was just a misting haze, more\nthan a fog but less than a drizzle. Enough to ruin hair, makeup, clothing—\nindeed, every element of a careful young woman’s efforts to present a\nsuitable face for trading."

Enough to ruin hair, makeup, clothing—\nindeed, every element of a careful young woman’s efforts to present a\nsuitable face for trading.\nRysn shifted the pot in her lap. She’d named the grass Tyvnk. Sullen.\nHer babsk had laughed at the name. He understood. In naming the grass,\nshe acknowledged that he was right and she had been wrong; his trade with\nthe Shin people last year had been exceptionally profitable.\nRysn chose not to be sullen at being proven so clearly wrong. She’d let\nher plant be sullen instead.\nThey’d traversed these waters for two days now, and then only after\nwaiting at port for weeks until the right time between highstorms for a trip\nonto the nearly enclosed sea. Today, the waters were shockingly still.\nAlmost as serene as those of the Purelake.\nVstim himself rode two boats over in their irregular flotilla. Paddled by\nnew parshmen, the sixteen sleek catamarans were laden with goods that had\nbeen purchased with the profits of their last expedition. Vstim was still\nresting in the back of his boat. He looked like little more than another\nbundle of cloth, almost indistinguishable from the sacks of goods.\nHe would be fine. People got sick. It happened, but he would become\nwell again.\nAnd the blood you saw on his handkerchief?\nShe suppressed the thought and pointedly turned around in her seat,\nshifting Tyvnk to the crook of her left arm. She kept the pot very clean. That\nsoil stuff the grass needed in order to live was even worse than crem, and it\nhad a proclivity for ruining clothing.\nGu, the flotilla’s guide, rode in her own boat, just behind her. He looked\na lot like a Purelaker with those long limbs, the leathery skin, and dark hair.\nEvery Purelaker she’d met, however, had cared deeply about those gods of\ntheirs. She doubted Gu had ever cared about anything.\nThat included getting them to their destination in a timely manner.\n“You said we were near,” she said to him.\n“Oh, we are,” he said, lifting his oar and then slipping it back down into\nthe water. “Soon, now.” He spoke Thaylen rather well, which was why he’d\nbeen hired. It certainly wasn’t for his punctuality.\n“Define ‘soon,’” Rysn said.\n“Define…”\n“What do you mean by ‘soon’?”\n“Soon. Today, maybe.”\nMaybe. Delightful.\nGu continued to paddle, only doing so on one side of the boat, yet\nsomehow keeping them from going in circles. At the rear of Rysn’s boat,\nKylrm—head of their guards—played with her parasol, opening it and\nclosing it again. He seemed to consider it a wondrous invention, though\nthey’d been popular in Thaylenah for ages now.\nShows how rarely Vstim’s workers get back to civilization. Another\ncheerful thought. Well, she’d apprenticed under Vstim wanting to travel to\nexotic places, and exotic this was. True, she’d expected cosmopolitan and\nexotic to go hand in hand. If she’d had half a wit—which she wasn’t sure"

If she’d had half a wit—which she wasn’t sure\nshe did, these days—she’d have realized that the really successful traders\nweren’t the ones who went where everyone else wanted to go.\n“Hard,” Gu said, still paddling with his lethargic pace. “Patterns are off,\nthese days. The gods do not walk where they always should. We shall find\nher. Yes, we shall.”\nRysn stifled a sigh and turned forward. With Vstim incapacitated again,\nshe was in charge of leading the flotilla. She wished she knew where she\nwas leading it—or even knew how to find their destination.\nThat was the trouble with islands that moved.\nThe boats glided past a shoal of branches breaking the sea’s surface.\nEncouraged by the wind, gentle waves lapped against the stiff branches,\nwhich reached out of the waters like the fingers of drowning men. The sea\nwas deeper than the Purelake, with its bafflingly shallow waters. Those\ntrees would be dozens of feet tall at the very least, with bark of stone. Gu\ncalled them i-nah, which apparently meant bad. They could slice up a boat’s\nhull.\nSometimes they’d pass branches hiding just beneath the glassy surface,\nalmost invisible. She didn’t know how Gu knew to steer clear of them. In\nthis, as in so much else, they just had to trust him. What would they do if he\nled them into an ambush out here on these silent waters? Suddenly, she felt\nvery glad that Vstim had ordered their guards to monitor his fabrial that\nshowed if people were drawing near. It—\nLand.\nRysn stood up in the catamaran, making it rock precariously. There was\nsomething ahead, a distant dark line.\n“Ah,” Gu said. “See? Soon.”\nRysn remained standing, waving for her parasol when a sprinkle of rain\nstarted to fall. The parasol barely helped, though it was waxed to double as\nan umbrella. In her excitement, she hardly gave it—or her increasingly\nfrizzy hair—a thought. Finally.\nThe island was much bigger than she’d expected. She’d imagined it to\nbe like a very large boat, not this towering rock formation jutting from the\nwaters like a boulder in a field. It was different from other islands she’d\nseen; there didn’t seem to be any beach, and it wasn’t flat and low, but\nmountainous. Shouldn’t the sides and top have eroded over time?\n“It’s so green,” Rysn said as they drew closer.\n“The Tai-na is a good place to grow,” Gu said. “Good place to live.\nExcept when it’s at war.”\n“When two islands get too close,” Rysn said. She’d read of this in\npreparation, though there were not many scholars who cared enough about\nthe Reshi to write of them. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of these moving\nislands floated in the sea. The people on them lived simple lives,\ninterpreting the movements of the islands as divine will.\n“Not always,” Gu said, chuckling. “Sometimes close Tai-na is good.\nSometimes bad.”\n“What determines?” Rysn asked.\n“Why, the Tai-na itself.”"

Primitives. What\nwas her babsk expecting to gain by trading here? “How can an island—”\nThen the island ahead of them moved.\nNot in the drifting way she’d imagined. The island’s very shape\nchanged, stones twisting and undulating, a huge section of rock rising in a\nmotion that seemed lethargic until one appreciated the grand scale.\nRysn sat down with a plop, her eyes wide. The rock—the leg—lifted,\nstreaming water like rainfall. It lurched forward, then crashed back down\ninto the sea with incredible force.\nThe Tai-na, the gods of the Reshi Isles, were greatshells.\nThis was the largest beast she’d ever seen, or ever heard of. Big enough\nto make mythological monsters like the chasmfiends of distant Natanatan\nseem like pebbles in comparison!\n“Why didn’t anyone tell me?” she demanded, looking back at the boat’s\nother two occupants. Surely Kylrm at least should have said something.\n“Is better to see,” Gu said, paddling with his usual relaxed posture. She\ndid not much care for his smirk.\n“And take away that moment of discovery?” Kylrm said. “I remember\nwhen I first saw one move. It’s worth not spoiling. We never tell the new\nguards when they first come.”\nRysn contained her annoyance and looked back at the “island.” Curse\nthose inaccurate accounts from her readings. Too much hearsay, not enough\nexperience. She found it hard to believe that no one had ever recorded the\ntruth. Likely, she simply had the wrong sources.\nA falling haze of rain shrouded the enormous beast in mist and enigma.\nWhat did a thing so big eat? Did it notice the people living upon its back;\ndid it care? Kelek… What was mating like for these monsters?\nIt had to be ancient. The boat drew into its shadow, and she could see\nthe greenery growing across its stony skin. Shalebark mounds made vast\nfields of vibrant colors. Moss coated nearly everything. Vines and rockbuds\nwound around trunks of small trees that had gained a foothold in cracks\nbetween plates of the animal’s shell.\nGu led the convoy around the hind leg—giving it a very wide berth, to\nher relief—and came up along the creature’s flank. Here, the shell dipped\ndown into the water, forming a platform. She heard the people before she\nsaw them, their laughter rising amid splashes. The rain stopped, so Rysn\nlowered her parasol and shook it over the water. She finally spotted the\npeople, a group of youths both male and female climbing up onto a ridge of\nshell and leaping from it into the sea.\nThat was not so surprising. The water of the Reshi Sea, like that of the\nPurelake, was remarkably warm. She had once ventured into the water near\nher homeland. It was a frigid experience, and not one to be engaged in\nwhile of sound mind. Frequently, alcohol and bravado were involved in any\nocean dip.\nOut here, though, she expected that swimmers were commonplace. She"

She\nhad not expected them to be unclothed.\nRysn blushed furiously as a group of people ran past on the docklike\nshell outcropping, as bare as the day they were born. Young men and\nwomen alike, uncaring of who saw. She was no Alethi prude, but… Kelek!\nShouldn’t they wear something?\nShamespren fell around her, shaped like white and red flower petals that\ndrifted on a wind. Behind her, Gu chuckled.\nKylrm joined him. “That’s another thing we don’t warn the newcomers\nabout.”\nPrimitives, Rysn thought. She shouldn’t blush so. She was an adult.\nWell, almost.\nThe flotilla continued toward a section of shell that formed a kind of\ndock—a low plate that hung mostly above water. They settled in to wait,\nthough for what, she didn’t know.\nAfter a few moments, the plate lurched—water streaming off it—as the\nbeast took another lethargic step. Waves lapped against the boats from the\nsplashdown ahead. Once things were settled, Gu guided the boat to the\ndock. “Up you go,” he said.\n“Shall we tie the boats to anything?” Rysn said.\n“No. Not safe, with movement. We will pull back.”\n“And at night? How do you dock the boats?”\n“When we sleep, we move boats away, tie together. Sleep out there.\nFind island again in the morning.”\n“Oh,” Rysn said, taking a calming breath and checking to make sure her\npot of grass was carefully stored in the bottom of the catamaran.\nShe stood up. This was not going to be kind to her shoes, which had\nbeen quite expensive. She had a feeling the Reshi wouldn’t care. She could\nprobably meet their king barefooted. Passions! From what she’d seen, she\ncould probably meet him bare-chested.\nShe climbed up carefully, and was pleased to find that despite being an\ninch or so underwater, the shell was not slippery. Kylrm climbed up with\nher and she handed him the folded-up parasol, stepping back and waiting as\nGu maneuvered his boat away. Another oarsman brought up his boat\ninstead, a longer catamaran with parshmen to help row.\nHer babsk huddled inside, wrapped in his blanket despite the heat, head\npropped up against the back of the boat. His pale skin had a waxy cast.\n“Babsk…” Rysn said, heart wrenching. “We should have turned\naround.”\n“Nonsense,” he said, his voice frail. He smiled anyway. “I’ve suffered\nworse. The trade must happen. We’ve leveraged too much.”\n“I will go to the island’s king and traders,” Rysn said. “And ask for\nthem to come here to negotiate with you on the docks.”\nVstim coughed into his hand. “No. These people aren’t like the Shin.\nMy weakness will ruin the deal. Boldness. You must be bold with the\nReshi.”\n“Bold?” Rysn said, glancing at the boat guide, who lounged with fingers"

You must be bold with the\nReshi.”\n“Bold?” Rysn said, glancing at the boat guide, who lounged with fingers\nin the water. “Babsk… the Reshi are a relaxed people. I do not think much\nmatters to them.”\n“You will be surprised, then,” Vstim said. He followed her gaze toward\nthe nearby swimmers, who giggled and laughed as they leaped into the\nwaters. “Life can be simple here, yes. It attracts such people like war\nattracts painspren.”\nAttracts… One of the women scampered past, and Rysn noticed with\nshock that she had Thaylen eyebrows. Her skin had been tanned in the sun,\nso the difference in tones hadn’t been immediately obvious. Picking\nthrough those swimming, Rysn saw others. Two that were probably\nHerdazians, even… an Alethi? Impossible.\n“People seek out this place,” Vstim said. “They like the life of the\nReshi. Here, they can simply go with the island. Fight when it fights\nanother island. Relax otherwise. There will be people like this in any\nculture, for every society is made of individuals. You must learn this. Do\nnot let your assumptions about a culture block your ability to perceive the\nindividual, or you will fail.”\nShe nodded. He seemed so frail, but his words were firm. She tried not\nto think about the swimming people. The fact that at least one of them was\nof her own kind made her even more embarrassed.\n“If you cannot trade with them…” Rysn said.\n“You must do it.”\nRysn felt cold, despite the heat. This was what she’d joined with Vstim\nto do, wasn’t it? How many times had she wished he would let her lead?\nWhy feel so timid now?\nShe glanced toward her own boat, moving off, carrying her pot of grass.\nShe looked back at her babsk. “Tell me what to do.”\n“They know much of foreigners,” Vstim said. “More than we know of\nthem. This is because so many of us come to live among them. Many of the\nReshi are as carefree as you say, but there are also many who are not. Those\nprefer to fight. And a trade… it is like a fight to them.”\n“To me too,” Rysn said.\n“I know these people,” Vstim said. “We must have Passion that Talik is\nnot here. He is their best, and often goes to trade with other islands.\nWhichever you do meet for trade, he or she will judge you as they would\njudge a rival in battle. And to them, battle is about posturing.\n“I once had the misfortune to be on an isle during war.” He paused,\ncoughing, but spurned the drink Kylrm tried to give him. “As the two\nislands raged, the people climbed down into boats to exchange insults and\nboasts. They would each start with their weakest, who would yell out\nboasts, then progress in a kind of verbal duel up to their greatest. After that,\narrows and spears, struggling on ships and in the water. Fortunately, there\nwas more yelling than actual cutting.”\nRysn swallowed, nodding.\n“You are not ready for this, child,” Vstim said."

Fortunately, there\nwas more yelling than actual cutting.”\nRysn swallowed, nodding.\n“You are not ready for this, child,” Vstim said.\n“I know.”\n“Good. Finally you realize it. Go now. They will not suffer us long on\ntheir island unless we agree to join them permanently.”\n“Which would require… ?” Rysn said.\n“Well, for one, it requires giving all you own to their king.”\n“Lovely,” Rysn said, rising. “I wonder how he’d look wearing my\nshoes.” She took a deep breath. “You still haven’t told me what we’re\ntrading for.”\n“They know,” her babsk said, then coughed. “Your conversation will not\nbe a negotiation. The terms were set years ago.”\nShe turned to him, frowning. “What?”\n“This is not about what you can get,” Vstim said, “but about whether or\nnot they think you are worthy of it. Convince them.” He hesitated.\n“Passions guide you, child. Do well.”\nIt seemed a plea. If their flotilla was turned away… The cost of this\ntrade was not in the goods—woods, cloth, simple supplies purchased\ncheaply—but in the outfitting of a convoy. It was in traveling so far, paying\nguides, wasting time waiting for a break between storms, then more time\nsearching for the right island. If she was turned away, they could still sell\nwhat they had—but at a stiff devastating loss, considering the high\noverhead of the trip.\nTwo of the guards, Kylrm and Nlent, joined her as she left Vstim and\nwalked along the docklike protrusion of shell. Now that they were so close,\nit was difficult to see a creature and not an island. Just ahead of her, the\npatina of lichen made the shell nearly indistinguishable from rock. Trees\nclustered here, their roots draping into the water, their branches reaching\nhigh and creating a forest.\nShe hesitantly stepped onto the only path leading up from the waters.\nHere, the “ground” formed steps that seemed far too square and regular to\nbe natural.\n“They cut into its shell?” Rysn said, climbing.\nKylrm grunted. “Chulls can’t feel their shells. This monster probably\ncan’t either.”\nAs they walked, he kept his hand on his gtet, a type of traditional\nThaylen sword. The thing had a large triangular wedge of a blade with a\ngrip directly at the base; you’d hold the grip like a fist, and the long blade\nwould extend out down past the knuckles, with parts of the hilt resting\naround the wrist for support. Right now, he wore it in a sheath at his side,\nalong with a bow on his back.\nWhy was he was so anxious? The Reshi were not supposed to be\ndangerous. Perhaps when you were a paid guard, it was better to assume\neveryone was dangerous.\nThe pathway wound upward through thick jungle. The trees here were\nlimber and hale, their branches almost constantly moving. And when the\nbeast stepped, everything shook.\nVines trembled and twisted on the pathway or drooped from branches,\nand these pulled out of the way at her approach, but crept back quickly after"

Soon, she couldn’t see the sea, or even smell its brine. The\njungle enveloped everything. Its thick green and brown were broken\noccasionally by pink and yellow mounds of shalebark that seemed to have\nbeen growing for generations.\nShe’d found the humidity oppressive before, but here it was\noverwhelming. She felt as if she were swimming, and even her thin linen\nskirt, blouse, and vest seemed as thick as old Thaylen highland winter gear.\nAfter an interminable climb, she heard voices. To her right, the forest\nopened up to a view of the ocean beyond. Rysn caught her breath. Endless\nblue waters, clouds dropping a haze of rain in patches that seemed so\ndistinct. And in the distance…\n“Another one?” she asked, pointing toward a shadow on the horizon.\n“Yeah,” Kylrm said. “Hopefully going the other way. I’d rather not be\nhere when they decide to war.” His grip tightened on the handle of his\nsword.\nThe voices came from farther up the way, so Rysn resigned herself to\nmore climbing. Her legs ached from the effort.\nThough the jungle remained impenetrable to her left, it remained open\nto her right, where the massive flank of the greatshell formed ridges and\nshelves. She caught sight of some people sitting around tents, leaning back\nand staring out over the sea. They hardly gave her and the two guards more\nthan a glance. Up farther, she found more Reshi.\nThese were jumping.\nMen and women alike—and in various states of undress—were taking\nturns leaping off the shell’s outcroppings with whoops and shouts,\nplummeting toward the waters far below. Rysn grew nauseated just\nwatching them. How high up were they?\n“They do it to shock you. They always jump from greater heights when\na foreigner is here.”\nRysn nodded, then—with a sudden start—realized that the comment\nhadn’t come from one of her guards. She turned and discovered that to her\nleft, the forest had moved back around a large outcrop of shell like a rock\nmound.\nThere, hanging upside down and tied by his feet to a point at the top of\nthe shell, was a lanky man with pale white skin verging on blue. He wore\nonly a loincloth, and his skin was covered with hundreds upon hundreds of\nsmall, intricate tattoos.\nRysn took a step toward him, but Kylrm grabbed her shoulder and\npulled her back. “Aimian,” he hissed. “Keep your distance.”\nThe blue fingernails and deep blue eyes should have been a clue. Rysn\nstepped back, though she couldn’t see his Voidbringer shadow.\n“Keep your distance indeed,” the man said. “Always a wise idea.” His\naccent was unlike any she’d heard, though he spoke Thaylen well. He hung\nthere with a pleasant smile on his face, as if completely indifferent to the\nfact that he was upside down.\n“Are you… well?” Rysn asked the man."

She wasn’t particularly superstitious—she was even\nskeptical of the Passions sometimes—but… well, this was an Aimian.\n“What fell curses did you bring on this people, beast?” Kylrm\ndemanded.\n“Improper puns,” the man said lazily. “And a stench from something I\nate that did not sit well with me. Are you off to speak with the king, then?”\n“I…” Rysn said. Behind her, another Reshi whooped and leaped from\nthe shelf. “Yes.”\n“Well,” the creature said, “don’t ask about the soul of their god. They\ndon’t like to speak of that, it turns out. Must be spectacular, to let the beasts\ngrow this large. Beyond even the spren who inhabit the bodies of ordinary\ngreatshells. Hmmm…” He seemed very pleased by something.\n“Do not feel for him, trademaster,” Kylrm said softly to her, steering her\naway from the dangling prisoner. “He could escape if he wished.”\nNlent, the other guard, nodded. “They can take off their limbs. Take off\ntheir skin too. No real body to them. Just something evil, taking human\nform.” The squat guard wore a charm on his wrist, a charm of courage,\nwhich he took off and held tightly in one hand. The charm hadn’t any\nproperties itself, of course. It was a reminder. Courage. Passion. Want what\nyou need, embrace it, desire it and bring it to you.\nWell, what she needed was her babsk to be here with her. She turned her\nsteps upward again, the confrontation with the Aimian leaving her\nunnerved. More people ran and leaped from the shelves to her right. Crazy.\nTrademaster, she thought. Kylrm called me “trademaster.” She wasn’t,\nnot yet. She was property owned by Vstim; for now just an apprentice who\nprovided occasional slave labor.\nShe didn’t deserve the title, but hearing it strengthened her. She led the\nway up the steps, which twisted farther around the beast’s shell. They\npassed a place where the ground split, the shell showing skin far beneath.\nThe rift was like a chasm; she couldn’t have leaped from one side to the\nother without falling in.\nReshi she passed on the path refused to respond to her questions.\nFortunately, Kylrm knew the way, and when the path split, he pointed to the\nright fork. At times, the path leveled out for significant distances, but then\nthere were always more steps.\nHer legs burning, her clothing damp with sweat, they reached the top of\nthis flight and—at long last—found no more steps.

Their\nbreastplates and armguards were of carapace carved wickedly with points,\nand though they wore only wraps for clothing, they stood as stiff-backed as\nany Alethi soldier, with stern expressions to match. So her babsk was right.\nNot every Reshi was the “lounge and swim” type.\nBoldness, she thought to herself, remembering Vstim’s words. She\ncould not show these people a timid face. The king stood at the end of the\npathway of guards and rockbuds, a diminutive figure on the edge of a\ncarapace shelf, looking toward the sun.\nRysn strode forward, passing through a double row of spears. She\nwould have expected the same kind of clothing on the king, but instead the\nman wore full, voluminous robes of vibrant green and yellow. They looked\nterribly hot.\nAs she drew nearer, Rysn got a sense for just how high she had climbed.\nThe waters below shimmered in the sunlight, so far down that Rysn\nwouldn’t have heard a rock hit if she’d dropped one. Far enough that\nlooking over the side made her stomach twist upon itself and her legs\ntremble.\nGetting close to the king would require stepping out onto that shelf\nwhere he stood. It would place her within a breath of plummeting down\nhundreds and hundreds of feet.\nSteady, Rysn told herself. She would show her babsk that she was\ncapable. She was not the ignorant girl who had misjudged the Shin or who\nhad offended the Iriali. She had learned.\nStill, perhaps she should have asked Nlent to lend her his charm of\ncourage.\nShe stepped out onto the shelf. The king seemed young, at least from\nbehind. Built like a youth, or…\nNo, Rysn thought with a start as the king turned. It was a woman, old\nenough that her hair was greying, but not so old that she was bent with age.\nSomeone stepped out onto the shelf behind Rysn. Younger, he wore the\nstandard wrap and tassels. His hair was in two braids that fell over tan, bare\nshoulders. When he spoke, there wasn’t even a hint of an accent to his\nvoice. “The king wishes to know why his old trading partner, Vstim, has not\ncome in person, and has instead sent a child in his place.”\n“And are you the king?” Rysn asked the newcomer.\nThe man laughed. “You stand beside him, yet ask that of me?”\nRysn looked toward the robed figure. The robes were tied with the front\nopen enough to show that the “king” definitely had breasts.\n“We are led by a king,” the newcomer said. “Gender is irrelevant.”\nIt seemed to Rysn that gender was part of the definition, but it wasn’t\nworth arguing over. “My master is indisposed,” she said, addressing the"

        "text": "It seemed to Rysn that gender was part of the definition, but it wasn’t\nworth arguing over. “My master is indisposed,” she said, addressing the\nnewcomer—he’d be the island’s trademaster. “I am authorized to speak for\nhim, and to accomplish the trade.”\nThe newcomer snorted, sitting down on the edge of the shelf, legs\nhanging out over the edge. Rysn’s stomach did a somersault. “He should\nhave known better. The trade is off, then.”\n“You are Talik, I assume?” Rysn said, folding her arms. The man was no\nlonger facing her. It seemed an intentional slight.\n“Yes.”\n“My master warned me about you.”\n“Then he isn’t a complete fool,” Talik said. “Just mostly.”\nHis pronunciation was astonishing. She found herself checking him for\nThaylen eyebrows, but he was obviously Reshi.\nRysn clenched her teeth, then forced herself to sit down beside him on\nthe edge. She tried to do it as nonchalantly as he had, but she just couldn’t.\nInstead, she settled down—not easy in a fashionable skirt—and scooted out\nbeside him.\nOh, Passions! I’m going to fall off of this and die. Don’t look down! Do\nnot look down!\nShe couldn’t help it. She glanced downward, and felt immediately\nwoozy. She could see the side of the head down there, the massive line of a\njaw. Nearby, standing on a ridge above the eye to Rysn’s right, people\npushed large bundles of fruit off the side. Tied with vine rope, the bundles\nswung down beside the maw below.\nMandibles moved slowly, pulling the fruit in, jerking the ropes. The\nReshi pulled those back up to affix more fruit, all under the eyes of the\nking, who was supervising the feeding from the very tip of the nose to\nRysn’s left.\n“A treat,” Talik said, noticing where she watched. “An offering. These\nsmall bundles of fruit, of course, do not sustain our god.”\n“What does?”\nHe smiled. “Why are you still here, young one? Did I not dismiss you?”\n“The trade does not have to be off,” Rysn said. “My master told me the\nterms were already set. We have brought everything you require in\npayment.” Though for what, I don’t know. “Turning me aside would be\npointless.”\nThe king, she noticed, had stepped closer to listen.\n“It would serve the same purpose as everything in life,” Talik said. “To\nplease Relu-na.”\nThat would be the name of their god, the greatshell. “And your island\nwould approve of such waste? Inviting traders all this way, only to send\nthem off empty-handed?”\n“Relu-na approves of boldness,” Talik said. “And, more importantly,\nrespect. If we do not respect the one with whom we trade, then we should\nnot do it.”\nWhat ridiculous logic. If a merchant followed that line of reasoning,\nhe’d never be able to trade. Except… in her months with Vstim, it seemed\nthat he’d often sought out people who liked trading with him. People he\nrespected. Those kinds of people certainly would be less likely to cheat you.\nPerhaps it wasn’t bad logic… simply incomplete."

Those kinds of people certainly would be less likely to cheat you.\nPerhaps it wasn’t bad logic… simply incomplete.\nThink like the other trader, she recalled. One of Vstim’s lessons—which\nwere so different from the ones she’d learned at home. What do they want?\nWhy do they want it? Why are you the best one to provide it?\n“It must be hard to live out here, in the waters,” Rysn said. “Your god is\nimpressive, but you cannot make everything you need for yourselves.”\n“Our ancestors did it just fine.”\n“Without medicines,” Rysn said, “that could have saved lives. Without\ncloth from fibers that grow only on the mainland. Your ancestors survived\nwithout these things because they had to. You do not.”\nThe trademaster hunched forward.\nDon’t do that! You’ll fall!\n“We are not idiots,” Talik said.\nRysn frowned. Why—\n“I’m so tired of explaining this,” the man continued. “We live simply.\nThat does not make us stupid. For years the outsiders came, trying to\nexploit us because of our ignorance. We are tired of it, woman. Everything\nyou say is true. Not true—obvious. Yet you say it as if we’d never stopped\nto consider. ‘Oh! Medicine! Of course we need medicine! Thank you for\npointing that out. I was just going to sit here and die.’”\nRysn blushed. “I didn’t—”\n“Yes, you did mean that,” Talik said. “The condescension dripped from\nyour lips, young lady. We’re tired of being taken advantage of. We’re tired\nof foreigners who try to trade us trash for riches. We don’t have knowledge\nof the current economic situation on the mainland, so we can’t know for\ncertain if we are being cheated or not. Therefore, we trade only with people\nwe know and trust. That is that.”\nCurrent economic situation on the mainland… ? Rysn thought. “You’ve\ntrained in Thaylenah,” she guessed.\n“Of course I have,” Talik said. “You have to know a predator’s tricks\nbefore you can catch him.” He settled back, which let her relax a little. “My\nparents sent me to train as a child. I had one of your babsks. I made\ntrademaster on my own before returning here.”\n“Your parents being the king and queen?” Rysn guessed again.\nHe eyed her. “The king and king’s consort.”\n“You could just call her a queen.”\n“This trade is not happening,” Talik said, standing. “Go and tell your\nmaster we are sorry for his illness and hope that he recovers. If he does, he\nmay return next year during the trading season and we will meet with him.”\n“You imply you respect him,” Rysn said, scrambling to her feet—and\naway from that drop. “So just trade with him!”\n“He is sickly,” Talik said, not looking at her. “It would not do him\njustice. We’d be taking advantage of him.”\nTaking advantage of… Passions, these people were strange. It seemed\neven odder to hear such things coming from the mouth of a man who spoke\nsuch perfect Thaylen."

It seemed\neven odder to hear such things coming from the mouth of a man who spoke\nsuch perfect Thaylen.\n“You’d trade with me if you respected me,” Rysn said. “If you thought I\nwas worthy of it.”\n“That will take years,” Talik said, joining his mother at the front of the\nshelf. “Go away, and—”\nHe cut off as the king spoke to him softly in Reshi.\nTalik drew his lips into a line.\n“What?” Rysn asked, stepping forward.\nTalik turned toward her. “You have apparently impressed the king. You\nargue fiercely. Though you dismiss us as primitives, you’re not as bad as\nsome.” He ground his teeth for a moment. “The king will hear your\nargument for a trade.”\nRysn blinked, looked from one to the other. Hadn’t she just made her\nargument for a trade, with the king listening?\nThe woman regarded Rysn with dark eyes and a calm expression. I’ve\nwon the first fight, Rysn realized, like the warriors on the battlefield. I’ve\ndueled and been judged worthy to spar with the one of greater authority.\nThe king spoke, and Talik interpreted. “The king says that you are\ntalented, but that the trade cannot—of course—continue. You should return\nwith your babsk when he comes again. In a decade or so, perhaps we will\ntrade with you.”\nRysn searched for an argument. “And is that how Vstim gained respect,\nYour Majesty?” She would not fail in this. She couldn’t! “Over years, with\nhis own babsk?”\n“Yes,” Talik said.\n“You didn’t interpret that,” Rysn said.\n“I…” Talik sighed, then interpreted her question.\nThe king smiled with apparent fondness. She spoke a few words in their\nlanguage, and Talik turned to his mother, looking shocked. “I… Wow.”\n“What?” Rysn demanded.\n“Your babsk slew a coracot with some of our hunters,” Talik said. “On\nhis own? A foreigner? I had not heard of such a thing.”\nVstim. Slaying something? With hunters? Impossible.\nThough he obviously hadn’t always been the wizened old ledgerworm\nthat he was now, she’d imagined he’d been a wizened young ledgerworm in\nthe past.\nThe king spoke again.\n“I doubt you’ll be slaying any beasts, child,” Talik interpreted. “Go.\nYour babsk will recover from this. He is wise.”\nNo. He is dying, Rysn thought. It came to her mind unbidden, but the\ntruth of it terrified her. More than the height, more than anything else she’d\nknown. Vstim was dying. This might be his final trade.\nAnd she was ruining it.\n“My babsk trusts me,” Rysn said, stepping closer to the king, moving\nalong the greatshell’s nose. “And you said you trust him. Can you not trust\nhis judgment that I am worthy?”\n“One cannot substitute for personal experience,” Talik translated.\nThe beast stepped, ground trembling, and Rysn clenched her teeth,"

Fortunately, up this high, the motion was\nmore like a gentle sway. Trees rustled, and her stomach lurched, but it\nwasn’t any more dangerous than a ship surging on a wave.\nRysn stepped closer to where the king stood beside the beast’s nose.\n“You are king—you know the importance of trusting those beneath you.\nYou cannot be everywhere, know everything. At times, you must accept the\njudgment of those you know. My babsk is such a man.”\n“You make a valid point,” Talik translated, sounding surprised. “But\nwhat you do not realize is that I have already paid your babsk this respect.\nThat is why I agreed to speak with you myself. I would not have done this\nfor another.”\n“But—”\n“Return below,” the king said through Talik, her voice growing harder.\nShe seemed to think this was the end. “Tell your babsk that you proceeded\nfar enough to speak with me personally. Doubtless, this is more than he\nexpected. You may leave the island, and return when he is well.”\n“I…” Rysn felt as if a fist were crushing her throat, making it hard for\nher to speak. She couldn’t fail him, not now.\n“Give him my best wishes for his recovery,” the king said, turning\naway.\nTalik smiled in what seemed to be satisfaction. Rysn glanced at her two\nguards, who bore grim expressions.\nRysn stepped away. She felt numb. Turned away, like a child demanding\nsweets. She felt a furious blush consume her as she walked past the men\nand women preparing more bundles of fruit.\nRysn stopped. She looked to her left, out at the endless expanse of blue.\nShe turned back toward the king. “I believe,” Rysn said loudly, “that I need\nto speak with someone with more authority.”\nTalik turned toward her. “You have spoken to the king. There is nobody\nwith more authority.”\n“I beg your pardon,” Rysn said. “But I do think there is.”\nOne of the ropes shook from having its fruit gift consumed. This is\nstupid, this is stupid, this is—\nDon’t think.\nRysn scrambled to the rope, causing her guards to cry out. She grabbed\nthe length of rope and let herself over the side, climbing down beside the\ngreatshell’s head. The god’s head.\nPassions! This was hard in a skirt. The rope bit into the skin of her arms,\nand it vibrated as the creature below crunched on the fruit upon its end.\nTalik’s head appeared above. “What in Kelek’s name are you doing,\nidiot woman?” he screamed. She found it amusing that he’d learned their\ncurses while studying with them.\nRysn clung to the rope, heart rushing in a mad panic. What was she\ndoing? “Relu-na,” she yelled back at Talik, “approves of boldness!”\n“There is a difference between boldness and stupidity!”\nRysn continued to climb down. It was more of a slide.

Oh, Craving,\nPassion of need…\n“Pull her back up!” Talik ordered. “You soldiers, help.” He gave further\norders in Reshi.\nRysn looked up as workers grabbed the rope to haul her back upward. A\nnew face appeared above, however, looking down. The king. She raised a\nhand, halting them as she studied Rysn.\nRysn continued on down. She didn’t go terribly far, maybe fifty feet or\nso. Not even down to the creature’s eye. She stopped herself, with effort,\nher fingers burning. “O great Relu-na,” Rysn said loudly, “your people\nrefuse to trade with me, and so I come to you to beg. Your people need what\nI have brought, but I need a trade even more. I cannot afford to return.”\nThe creature, of course, did not reply. Rysn hung in place beside its\nshell, which was crusted with lichen and small rockbuds.\n“Please,” Rysn said. “Please.”\nWhat am I expecting to happen? Rysn wondered. She didn’t expect the\nthing to make any sort of reply. But maybe she could persuade those above\nthat she was bold enough to be worthy. It couldn’t hurt, at least.\nThe rope quivered in her hands, and she made the mistake of glancing\ndown.\nActually, what she was doing could hurt. Very much.\n“The king,” Talik said above, “has commanded that you return.”\n“Will our negotiation continue?” Rysn asked, glancing up. The king\nactually looked concerned.\n“That’s not important,” Talik said. “You have been issued a command.”\nRysn gritted her teeth, clinging to the rope, looking at the plates of\nchitin before her. “And what do you think?” she asked softly.\nDown below, the thing bit down, and the rope suddenly became very\ntight, slapping Rysn against the side of the enormous head. Above, workers\nshouted. The king yelled at them in a sudden, sharp voice.\nOh no…\nThe rope pulled even tighter.\nThen snapped.\nThe shouts grew frantic above, though Rysn barely noticed them as\npanic struck. She did not fall gracefully, but as a flurry of screaming cloth\nand legs, her skirt flapping, her stomach lurching. What had she done? She\n—\nShe saw an eye. The god’s eye. Only a glimpse as she passed; it was as\nlarge as a house, glassy and black, and it reflected her falling form.\nShe seemed to hang before it for a fraction of a second, and her scream\ndied in her throat.\nIt was gone in a moment. Then rushing wind, another scream, and a\ncrash into water hard as stone.\nBlackness.\n* * *\nRysn found herself floating when she awoke. She didn’t open her eyes,\nbut she could sense that she was floating. Drifting, bobbing up and down…\n“She is an idiot.” She knew that voice.

It was hot.\nHer vision swam, and she drifted… drifted because her mind was cloudy.\nWhat had they given her? She tried to sit up. Her legs wouldn’t move. Her\nlegs wouldn’t move.\nShe gasped, then began breathing quickly.\nVstim’s face appeared above her, followed by a concerned Reshi\nwoman with ribbons in her hair. Not the queen… king… whatever. This\nwoman spoke quickly in the barking language of the Reshi.\n“Calm now,” Vstim said to Rysn, kneeling beside her. “Calm… They’ll\nget you something to drink, child.”\n“I lived,” Rysn said. Her voice rasped as she spoke.\n“Barely,” Vstim said, though with fondness. “The spren cushioned your\nfall. From that height… Child, what were you thinking, climbing over the\nside like that?”\n“I needed to do something,” Rysn said. “To prove courage. I thought… I\nneeded to be bold…”\n“Oh, child. This is my fault.”\n“You were his babsk,” Rysn said. “Talik, their trader. You set this up\nwith him, so I could have a chance to trade on my own, but in a controlled\nsetting. The trade was never in danger, and you are not as sick as you\nappear.” The words boiled out, tumbling over one another like a hundred\nmen trying to leave through the same doorway at once.\n“When did you figure that out?” Vstim asked, then coughed.\n“I…” She didn’t know. It just all kind of fell together for her. “Right\nnow.”\n“Well, you must know that I feel a true fool,” Vstim said. “I thought this\nwould be a perfect chance for you. A practice with real stakes. And then…\nThen you went and fell off the island’s head!”\nRysn squeezed her eyes shut as the Reshi woman arrived with a cup of\nsomething. “Will I walk again?” Rysn asked softly.\n“Here, drink this,” Vstim said.\n“Will I walk again?” She didn’t take the cup, and kept her eyes closed.\n“I don’t know,” Vstim said. “But you will trade again. Passions! Daring\nto go above the king’s authority? Being saved by the island’s soul itself?”\nHe chuckled. It sounded forced. “The other islands will be clamoring to\ntrade with us.”\n“Then I accomplished something,” she said, feeling a complete and utter\nidiot.\n“Oh, you accomplished something indeed,” Vstim said.\nShe felt a prickling pressure on her arm and opened her eyes with a\nsnap. Something crawled there, about as big as the palm of her hand—a\ncreature that looked like a cremling, but with wings that folded along the\nback.\n“What is it?” Rysn demanded.\n“Why we came here,” Vstim said. “The thing we trade for, a treasure"

He held the large cut gemstone\nup to Bila, who took it and tapped it with her finger.\nThey were a warpair of Eshonai’s own personal division. They dressed\nin simple garments that were tailored around the chitinous armor plates on\ntheir arms, legs, and chests. Thude also wore a long coat, but he wouldn’t\ntake that to battle.\nEshonai, by contrast, wore her uniform—tight red cloth that stretched\nover her natural armor—and a cap on her skullplate. She never spoke of\nhow that uniform imprisoned her, felt like manacles that tied her in place.\n“A stormspren,” Bila said to the Rhythm of Skepticism as she turned the\nstone over in her fingers. “Will it help me kill humans? Otherwise, I don’t\nsee why I should care.”\n“This could change the world, Bila,” Eshonai said. “If Venli is right, and\nshe can bond with this spren and come out with anything other than\ndullform… well, at the very least we will have an entirely new form to\nchoose. At the greatest we will have power to control the storms and tap\ntheir energy.”\n“So she will try this personally?” Thude asked to the Rhythm of Winds,\nthe rhythm that they used to judge when a highstorm was near.\n“If the Five give her permission.” They were to discuss it, and make\ntheir decision, today.\n“That’s great,” Bila said, “but will it help me kill humans?”\nEshonai attuned Mourning. “If stormform is truly one of the ancient"

It will help you kill humans. Many of them.”\n“Good enough for me, then,” Bila said. “Why are you so worried?”\n“The ancient powers are said to have come from our gods.”\n“Who cares? If the gods would help us kill those armies out there, then\nI’d swear to them right now.”\n“Don’t say that, Bila,” Eshonai said to Reprimand. “Never say anything\nlike that.”\nThe woman quieted, tossing the stone onto the table. She hummed\nsoftly to Skepticism. That walked the line of insubordination. Eshonai met\nBila’s eyes and found herself softly humming to Resolve.\nThude glanced from Bila to Eshonai. “Food?” he asked.\n“Is that your answer to every disagreement?” Eshonai asked, breaking\nher song.\n“It’s hard to argue with your mouth full,” Thude said.\n“I’m sure I’ve seen you do just that,” Bila said. “Many times.”\n“The arguments end happy, though,” Thude said. “Because everyone is\nfull. So… food?”\n“Fine,” Bila said, glancing at Eshonai.\nThe two withdrew. Eshonai sat down at the table, feeling drained. When\nhad she started worrying if her friends were insubordinate? It was this\nhorrid uniform.\nShe picked up the gemstone, staring into its depths. It was a large one,\nabout a third the size of her fist, though gemstones didn’t have to be large to\ntrap a spren inside.\nShe hated trapping them. The right way was to go into the highstorm\nwith the proper attitude, singing the proper song to attract the proper spren.\nYou bonded it in the fury of the raging storm and were reborn with a new\nbody. People had been doing this from the arrival of the first winds.\nThe listeners had learned that capturing spren was possible from the\nhumans, then had figured out the process on their own. A captive spren\nmade the transformation much more reliable. Before, there had always been\nan element of chance. You could go into the storm wanting to become a\nsoldier, and come out a mate instead.\nThis is progress, Eshonai thought, staring at the little smoky spren\ninside the stone. Progress is learning to control your world. Put up walls to\nstop the storms, choose when to become a mate. Progress was taking nature\nand putting a box around it.\nEshonai pocketed the gemstone, and checked the time. Her meeting\nwith the rest of the Five wasn’t scheduled until the third movement of the\nRhythm of Peace, and she had a good half a movement until then.\nIt was time to speak with her mother.\nEshonai stepped out into Narak and walked along the path, nodding to\nthose who saluted.

Still, dullform was a\nlimiting form, without the capacities and advantages of newer forms. There\nshouldn’t have been any here. Had these people bonded the wrong spren by\nmistake?

His voice\nsounded dead. “We did it.”\n“Why?” Eshonai said. “Why would you do this?”\n“Humans won’t kill us when they come,” the malen said, hefting his\nrockbud and continuing on his way.

She could almost ignore\nthe damage at this point.\nA city full of empty buildings, and Eshonai’s mother chose a shack on\nthe very edge of the city, almost fully exposed to the storms. Mother\nworked her shalebark rows outside, humming softly to herself to the\nRhythm of Peace. She wore workform; she’d always preferred it. Even after\nnimbleform had been discovered, Mother had not changed. She had said she\ndidn’t want to encourage people to see one form as more valuable than\nanother, that such stratification could destroy them.\nWise words. The type Eshonai hadn’t heard out of her mother in years.\n“Child!” Mother said as Eshonai approached. Solid despite her years,\nMother had a neat round face and wore her hairstrands in a braid, tied with\na ribbon. Eshonai had brought her that ribbon from a meeting with the\nAlethi years ago. “Child, have you seen your sister? It is her day of first\ntransformation! We need to prepare her.”\n“It is attended to, Mother,” Eshonai said to the Rhythm of Peace,\nkneeling down beside the woman. “How goes the pruning?”\n“I should be finishing soon,” Mother said. “I need to leave before the\npeople who own this house return.”\n“You own it, Mother.”\n“No, no. It belongs to two others. They were in the house last night, and\ntold me I needed to leave. I’ll just finish with this shalebark before I go.”\nShe got out her file, smoothing one side of a ridge, then painting it with sap\nto encourage growth in that direction.\nEshonai sat back, attuning Mourning, and Peace left her. Perhaps she\nshould have chosen the Rhythm of the Lost instead. It changed in her head.\nShe forced it back. No. No, her mother was not dead.\nShe wasn’t fully alive, either.\n“Here, take this,” Mother said to Peace, handing Eshonai a file. At least\nMother recognized her today. “Work on that outcropping there. I don’t want\nit to keep growing downward. We need to send it up, up toward the light.”\n“The storms are too strong on this side of the city.”\n“Storms? Nonsense. No storms here.” Mother paused. “I wonder where\nwe’ll be taking your sister. She’ll need a storm for her transformation.”\n“Don’t worry about that, Mother,” Eshonai said, forcing herself to speak\nto Peace. “I will care for it.”\n“You are so good, Venli,” Mother said. “So helpful. Staying home, not\nrunning off, like your sister. That girl… She’s never where she should be.”\n“She is now,” Eshonai whispered. “She’s trying to be.”\nMother hummed to herself, continuing working. Once, this woman had\none of the best memories in the city. She still did, in a way.\n“Mother,” Eshonai said, “I need help. I think something terrible is going\nto happen. I can’t decide if it is less terrible than what is already\nhappening.”\nMother filed at a section of shalebark, then blew off the dust."

        "text": "to happen. I can’t decide if it is less terrible than what is already\nhappening.”\nMother filed at a section of shalebark, then blew off the dust.\n“Our people are crumbling,” Eshonai said. “We’re being weathered\naway. We moved to Narak and chose a war of attrition. That has meant six\nyears with steady losses. People are giving up.”\n“That’s not good,” Mother said.\n“But the alternative? Dabbling in things we shouldn’t, things that might\nbring the eyes of the Unmade upon us.”\n“You’re not working,” Mother said, pointing. “Don’t be like your\nsister.”\nEshonai placed her hands in her lap. This wasn’t helping. Seeing\nMother like this…\n“Mother,” Eshonai said to Supplication, “why did we leave the dark\nhome?”\n“Ah, now that’s an old song, Eshonai,” Mother said. “A dark song, not\nfor a child like you. Why, it’s not even your day of first transformation.”\n“I’m old enough, Mother. Please?”\nMother blew on her shalebark. Had she forgotten, finally, this last part\nof what she had been? Eshonai’s heart sank.\n“Long are the days since we knew the dark home,” Mother sang softly\nto one of the Rhythms of Remembrance. “The Last Legion, that was our\nname then. Warriors who had been set to fight in the farthest plains, this\nplace that had once been a nation and was now rubble. Dead was the\nfreedom of most people. The forms, unknown, were forced upon us. Forms\nof power, yes, but also forms of obedience. The gods commanded, and we\ndid obey, always. Always.”\n“Except for that day,” Eshonai said along with her mother, in rhythm.\n“The day of the storm when the Last Legion fled,” Mother continued in\nsong. “Difficult was the path chosen. Warriors, touched by the gods, our\nonly choice to seek dullness of mind. A crippling that brought freedom.”\nMother’s calm, sonorous song danced with the wind. As frail as she\nseemed other times, when she sang the old songs, she seemed herself again.\nA parent who had at times conflicted with Eshonai, but a parent whom\nEshonai had always respected.\n“Daring was the challenge made,” Mother sang, “when the Last Legion\nabandoned thought and power in exchange for freedom. They risked\nforgetting all. And so songs they composed, a hundred stories to tell, to\nremember. I tell them to you, and you will tell them to your children, until\nthe forms are again discovered.”\nFrom there, Mother launched into one of the early songs, about how the\npeople would make their home in the ruins of an abandoned kingdom. How\nthey would spread out, act as simple tribes and refugees. It was their plan to\nremain hidden, or at least ignored.\nThe songs left out so much. The Last Legion hadn’t known how to\ntransform into anything other than dullform and mateform, at least not\nwithout the help of the gods. How had they known the other forms were\npossible? Had these facts originally been recorded in the songs, and then\nlost over the years as words changed here and there?"

Had these facts originally been recorded in the songs, and then\nlost over the years as words changed here and there?\nEshonai listened, and though her mother’s voice did help her attune\nPeace again, she found herself deeply troubled anyway. She had come here\nfor answers. Once, that would have worked.\nNo longer.\nEshonai stood to leave her mother singing.\n“I found some of your things,” Mother said, breaking the song, “when\ncleaning today. You should take them. They clutter the home, and I will be\nmoving out soon.”\nEshonai hummed Mourning to herself, but went to see just what her\nmother had “discovered.” Another pile of rocks, in which she saw child’s\nplaythings? Strips of cloth she imagined were clothing?\nEshonai found a small sack in front of the building. She opened it to\nfind paper.\nPaper made from local plants, not human paper. Rough paper, with\nvaried color, made after the old listener way. Textured and full, not neat and\nsterile. The ink on it was beginning to fade, but Eshonai recognized the\ndrawings.\nMy maps, she thought. From those early days.\nWithout meaning to, she attuned Remembrance. Days spent hiking\nacross the wilderness of what the humans called Natanatan, passing through\nforests and jungles, drawing her own maps and expanding the world. She’d\nstarted alone, but her discoveries had excited an entire people. Soon, though\nstill in her teenage years, she’d been leading entire expeditions to find new\nrivers, new ruins, new spren, new plants.\nAnd humans. In a way, this was all her fault.\nHer mother started singing again.\nLooking through her old maps, Eshonai found a powerful longing\nwithin her. Once, she’d seen the world as something fresh and exciting.\nNew, like a blossoming forest after a storm. She was dying slowly, as surely\nas her people were.\nShe packed up the maps and left her mother’s house, walking toward\nthe center of town. Her mother’s song, still beautiful, echoed behind her.\nEshonai attuned Peace. That let her know that she was nearly late for the\nmeeting with the rest of the Five.\nShe did not hasten her pace. She let the steady, sweeping beats of the\nRhythm of Peace carry her forward. Unless you concentrated on attuning a\ncertain rhythm, your body would naturally choose the one that fit your\nmood. Therefore, it was always a conscious decision to listen to a rhythm\nthat did not match how you felt. She did this now with Peace.\nThe listeners had made a decision centuries ago, a decision that set them\nback to primitive levels. Choosing to murder Gavilar Kholin had been an\nact to affirm that decision of their ancestors. Eshonai had not then been one\nof their leaders, but they had listened to her counsel and given her the right\nto vote among them.\nThe choice, horrible though it seemed, had been one of courage. They’d\nhoped that a long war would bore the Alethi.\nEshonai and the others had underestimated Alethi greed. The gemhearts\nhad changed everything."

        "text": "hoped that a long war would bore the Alethi.\nEshonai and the others had underestimated Alethi greed. The gemhearts\nhad changed everything.\nIn the center of town, near the pool, was a tall tower that remained\nproudly erect in defiance of centuries’ worth of storms. Once, there had\nbeen steps within, but crem leaking in windows had filled the building up\nwith rock. So workers had carved steps running around its outside.\nEshonai started up the steps, holding to the chain for safety. It was a\nlong but familiar climb. Though her leg ached, warform had great\nendurance—though it required more food than any other form to keep it\nstrong. She made it to the top with ease.\nShe found the other members of the Five waiting for her, one member\nwearing each known form. Eshonai for warform, Davim for workform,\nAbronai for mateform, Chivi for nimbleform, and the quiet Zuln for\ndullform. Venli waited as well, with her once-mate, though he was flushed\nfrom the difficult climb. Nimbleform, though good for many delicate\nactivities, did not have great endurance.\nEshonai stepped up onto the flat top of the once-tower, wind blowing\nagainst her from the east. There were no chairs up here, and the Five sat on\nthe bare rock itself.\nDavim hummed to Annoyance. With the rhythms in one’s head, it was\ndifficult to be late by accident. They rightly suspected that Eshonai had\ndallied.\nShe sat on the rock and took the spren-filled gemstone from her pocket,\nsetting it on the ground in front of her. The violet stone glowed with\nStormlight.\n“I am worried about this test,” Eshonai said. “I do not think we should\nallow it to proceed.”\n“What?” Venli said to Anxiety. “Sister, don’t be ridiculous. Our people\nneed this.”\nDavim leaned forward, arms on his knees. He was broad faced, his\nworkform skin marbled mostly of black with tiny swirls of red here and\nthere. “If this works, it will be an amazing advance. The first of the forms of\nancient power, rediscovered.”\n“Those forms are tied to the gods,” Eshonai said. “What if, in choosing\nthis form, we invite them to return?”\nVenli hummed Irritation. “In the old day, all forms came from the gods.\nWe have found that nimbleform does not harm us. Why would stormform?”\n“It is different,” Eshonai said. “Sing the song; hum it to yourself. ‘Its\ncoming brings the gods their night.’ The ancient powers are dangerous.”\n“Men have them,” Abronai said. He wore mateform, lush and plump,\nthough he controlled its passions. Eshonai had never envied him the\nposition; she knew, from private conversations, that he would have\npreferred to have another form. Unfortunately, others who held mateform\neither did so transiently—or did not possess the proper solemnity to join the\nFive.\n“You yourself brought us the report, Eshonai,” Abronai continued. “You\nsaw a warrior among the Alethi using ancient powers, and many others"

Surgebindings have returned to men. The spren again\nbetray us.”\n“If Surgebindings are back,” Davim said to Consideration, “then it\nmight indicate that the gods are returning anyway. If so, we’d best be\nprepared to deal with them. Forms of power will help with that.”\n“We don’t know they will come,” Eshonai said to Resolve. “We don’t\nknow any of this. Who knows if men even have Surgebindings—it might be\none of the Honorblades. We left one in Alethkar that night.”\nChivi hummed to Skepticism. Her nimbleform face had elongated\nfeatures, her hairstrands tied back in a long tail. “We are fading as a people.\nI passed some today who had taken dullform, and not to remember our past.\nThey did so because they worried that men would kill them otherwise! They\nprepare themselves to become slaves!”\n“I saw them too,” Davim said to Resolve. “We must do something,\nEshonai. Your soldiers are losing this war, beat by beat.”\n“The next storm,” Venli said. She used the Rhythm of Pleading. “I can\ntest this at the next storm.”\nEshonai closed her eyes. Pleading. It was a rhythm not often attuned. It\nwas hard to deny her sister in this.\n“We must be unified in this decision,” Davim said. “I will accept\nnothing else. Eshonai, do you insist on objecting? Will we need to spend\nhours here making this decision?”\nShe took a deep breath, coming to a decision that had been working its\nway through the back of her mind. The decision of an explorer. She glanced\nat the sack of maps she’d set on the floor beside her.\n“I will agree to this test,” Eshonai said.\nNearby, Venli hummed to Appreciation.\n“However,” Eshonai continued to Resolve, “I must be the one who tries\nthe new form first.”\nAll humming stopped. The others of the Five gaped at her.\n“What?” Venli said. “Sister, no! It is my right.”\n“You are too valuable,” Eshonai said. “You know too much about the\nforms, and much of your research is held only in your head. I am simply a\nsoldier. I can be spared if this goes wrong.”\n“You are a Shardbearer,” Davim said. “Our last.”\n“Thude has trained with my Blade and Plate,” Eshonai said. “I will\nleave both with him, just in case.”\nThe others of the Five hummed to Consideration.\n“This is a good suggestion,” Abronai said. “Eshonai has both strength\nand experience.”\n“It was my discovery!” Venli said to Irritation.\n“And you are appreciated for it,” Davim said. “But Eshonai is right; you\nand your scholars are too important to our future.”\n“More than that,” Abronai added. “You are too close to the project,\nVenli.

If Eshonai enters the storms and\ndiscovers that something is off about this form, she can halt the experiment\nand return to us.”\n“This is a good compromise,” Chivi said, nodding. “Are we in\nagreement?”\n“I believe so,” Abronai said, turning toward Zuln.\nThe representative of the dullforms rarely spoke. She wore the smock of\na parshman, and had indicated that she considered it her duty to represent\nthem—those with no songs—along with any dullforms among them.\nHers was as noble a sacrifice as Abronai holding to mateform. More so.\nDullform was a difficult form to suffer, one that only a few ever\nexperienced for longer than a stormpause or so.\n“I agree to this,” Zuln said.\nThe others hummed to Appreciation. Only Venli did not join in the song.\nIf this stormform turned out to be real, would they add another person to the\nFive? At first, the Five had all been dullforms, then all workers. It was only\nat the discovery of nimbleform that it had been decided that they would\nhave one of each form.\nA question for later. The others of the Five stood up, then began to make\ntheir way down the long flight of steps spiraling around the tower. Wind\nblew from the east, and Eshonai turned toward it, looking out over the\nbroken Plains—toward the Origin of Storms.\nDuring a coming highstorm, she would step into the winds and become\nsomething new. Something powerful. Something that would change the\ndestiny of the listeners, and perhaps the humans, forever.\n“I nearly had cause to hate you, Sister,” Venli said to Reprimand, idling\nbeside where Eshonai sat.\n“I did not forbid this test,” Eshonai said.\n“Instead you take its glory.”\n“If there is glory to be had,” Eshonai said to Reprimand, “it will be\nyours for discovering the form. That should not be a consideration. Only\nour future should matter.”\nVenli hummed to Irritation. “They called you wise, experienced. It\nmakes one wonder if they’ve forgotten who you were—that you went off\nrecklessly into the wilds, ignoring your people, while I stayed home and\nmemorized songs. When did everyone start believing you were the\nresponsible one?”\nIt’s this cursed uniform, Eshonai thought, rising. “Why didn’t you tell us\nwhat you were researching? You let me believe your studies were to find\nartform or mediationform. Instead, you were looking for one of the forms of\nancient power.”\n“Does that matter?”\n“Yes. It makes all the difference, Venli. I love you, but your ambition\nfrightens me.”\n“You don’t trust me,” Venli said to Betrayal.\nBetrayal. That was a song rarely sung. It stung enough to make Eshonai\nwince.\n“We’ll see what this form does,” Eshonai said, picking up her maps and\nthe gemstone with the trapped spren. “Then we will talk further. I just want\nto be careful.”"

Come with me; I will need to train you in\nthe proper mindset to help the form work. Then we will pick a highstorm\nfor the transformation.”\nEshonai nodded. She would go through this training. In the meantime,\nshe would consider. Perhaps there was another way. If she could get the\nAlethi to listen to her, find Dalinar Kholin, sue for peace…\nPerhaps then, this would not be needed.\nPart Two: Winds’ Approach\n13. The Day’s Masterpiece\nWarform is worn for battle and reign,\nClaimed by the gods, given to kill.\nUnknown, unseen, but vital to gain.\nIt comes to those with the will.\nFrom the Listener Song of Listing, 15th\nstanza\nThe wagon rattled and shook its way across the stone ground, Shallan\nperched on the hard seat next to Bluth, one of the slab-faced mercenaries\nTvlakv employed. He guided the chull pulling the wagon, and didn’t speak\nmuch, though when he thought she wasn’t looking, he would inspect her\nwith eyes like beads of dark glass.\nIt was chilly. She wished the weather would turn, and spring—or even\nsummer—would come for a time. That wasn’t likely in a place notorious\nfor its permanent chill. Having improvised a blanket from the lining of\nJasnah’s trunk, Shallan draped it over her knees and down to her feet, as\nmuch to obscure how tattered her skirt had become as against the cold.\nShe tried to distract herself by studying the surroundings; the flora out\nhere in the southern Frostlands was completely unfamiliar to her. If there\nwas grass, it grew in patches along the leeward sides of rocks, with short\nspiky blades rather than long, waving ones. The rockbuds never grew larger\nthan a fist, and they didn’t open all the way, even when she’d tried pouring\nwater on one. Their vines were lazy and slow, as if numbed by the cold.\nThere were also spindly little shrubs that grew in cracks and along hillsides.\nTheir brittle branches scraped the sides of the wagon, their tiny green leaves\nthe size of raindrops folding and pulling into the stalks.\nThe shrubs grew prolifically, spreading wherever they could find\npurchase. As the wagon rolled past a particularly tall clump, Shallan\nreached out and snapped off a branch. It was tubular, with an open center,\nand felt rough like sand.\n“These are too fragile for highstorms,” Shallan said, holding it up.\n“How does this plant survive?”\nBluth grunted.\n“It is common, Bluth,” Shallan said, “to engage one’s traveling\ncompanion in mutually diverting dialogue.”\n“I’d do that,” he said darkly, “if I knew what in Damnation half those\nwords meant.”\nShallan started. She honestly hadn’t expected a response. “Then we are\neven,” she said, “as you use plenty of words I don’t know. Admittedly, I\nthink most of them are curses…”"

Admittedly, I\nthink most of them are curses…”\nShe’d meant it lightheartedly, but his expression only darkened further.\n“You think I’m as dumb as that stick.”\nStop insulting my stick. The words came to her mind, and almost to her\nlips, unbidden. She should have been better at holding her tongue,\nconsidering her upbringing. But freedom—without the fear that her father\nwas looming behind every closed door—had severely diminished her self-\ncontrol.\nShe suppressed the taunt this time. “Stupidity is a function of one’s\nsurroundings,” she said instead.\n“You’re saying I’m dumb because I was raised that way?”\n“No. I’m saying that everyone is stupid in some situations. After my\nship was lost, I found myself ashore but unable to make a fire to warm\nmyself. Would you say that I’m stupid?”\nHe shot her a glance, but did not speak. Perhaps to a darkeyes, that\nquestion sounded like a trap.\n“Well I am,” Shallan said. “In many areas, I’m stupid. Perhaps when it\ncomes to large words, you’re stupid. That’s why we need both scholars and\ncaravan workers, guardsman Bluth. Our stupidities complement one\nanother.”\n“I can see why we need fellows who know how to light fires,” Bluth\nsaid. “But I don’t see why we need people to use fancy words.”\n“Shhhh,” Shallan said. “Don’t say that so loudly. If the lighteyes hear,\nthey might stop wasting their time making up new words, and instead start\ninterfering with the business of honest men.”\nHe glanced at her again. Not even a glimmer of humor in the eyes\nbeneath that thick brow. Shallan sighed, but turned her attention back to the\nplants. How did they survive highstorms? She should get out her sketchpad\nand—\nNo.\nShe blanked her mind and let it go. A short time later, Tvlakv called the\nmidday halt. Shallan’s wagon slowed, and one of the others pulled up\nbeside it.\nTag drove this one, with the two parshmen sitting in the cage behind,\nworking quietly at weaving hats from reeds they’d gathered in the morning.\nPeople often ordered parshmen to do such menial work—something to\nmake sure all of their time was spent earning money for those who owned\nthem. Tvlakv would sell the hats for a few chips at his destination.\nThey kept working as the wagon stopped. They would have to be told to\ndo something else, and had to be trained specifically for each job they did.\nBut once they were trained, they would work without complaint.\nShallan had difficulty not seeing their quiet obedience as something\npernicious. She shook her head, then held out her hand to Bluth, who\nhelped her from the wagon without further prodding. On the ground, she\nrested her hand on the side of the vehicle and breathed in sharply through\nher teeth. Stormfather, what had she done to her feet? Painspren wiggled\nout of the wall beside her, little orange bits of sinew—like hands with the\nflesh removed."

We are poor for merchants,\nyou see, and cannot afford delicacies.”\n“Whatever you have will suffice,” Shallan said, trying to keep the pain\nfrom showing in her face, though the spren had already given her away.\n“Please have one of your men get down my trunk.”\nTvlakv did so without complaint, though he watched hungrily as Bluth\nlowered it to the ground. It seemed a particularly bad idea to let him see\nwhat was inside; the less information he had, the better off she would be.\n“These cages,” Shallan said, looking over the back of her wagon, “from\nthose clasps at top, it looks like the wooden sides can be affixed over the\nbars.”\n“Yes, Brightness,” Tvlakv said. “For highstorms, you see.”\n“You only have enough slaves to fill one of the three wagons,” Shallan\nsaid. “And the parshmen ride in another. This one is empty, and will make\nan excellent traveling wagon for me. Put the sides on.”\n“Brightness?” he said with surprise. “You want to be put into the cage?”\n“Why not?” Shallan asked, meeting his eyes. “Certainly I’m safe in\nyour custody, tradesman Tvlakv.”\n“Er… yes…”\n“You and your men must be well acquainted with rough travel,” Shallan\nsaid calmly, “but I am not. Sitting day in and out in the sun on a hard bench\nwill not suit me. A proper carriage, however, would be a welcome\namelioration of this wilderness journey.”\n“Carriage?” Tvlakv said. “It’s a slave wagon!”\n“Mere words, tradesman Tvlakv,” Shallan said. “If you please?”\nHe sighed, but gave the order, and the men pulled the sides out from\nbeneath the wagon and hooked them up on the outside. They left off the\nback one, where the cage door was. The result did not look especially\ncomfortable, but it would offer some privacy. Shallan had Bluth haul her\nchest up and inside, to Tvlakv’s dismay. Then, she climbed in and pulled the\ncage door shut. She held her hand out through the bars toward Tvlakv.\n“Brightness?”\n“The key,” she said.\n“Oh.” He pulled it out of a pocket, regarding it for a moment—too long\na moment—before handing it to her.\n“Thank you,” she replied. “You may send Bluth with my meal when it is\nready, but I shall require a bucket of clean water immediately. You have\nbeen most accommodating. I will not forget your service.”\n“Er… Thank you.” It almost sounded like a question, and as he walked\naway, he seemed confused.

He’d quickly come a long way from\nspending hours spinning in the center of a room or climbing up and down\nwalls.\nShallan took out some spheres for better light, then removed one of the\ncloths Jasnah had wrapped around her books. It was immaculately clean.\nShallan dipped the cloth into the bucket of water and began to wash her\nfeet.\n“Before I saw Jasnah’s expression that night,” she explained, “before I\ntalked to her through her fatigue and got a sense of just how worried she\nwas, I had fallen into a trap. The trap of a scholar. Despite my initial horror\nat what Jasnah had described about the parshmen, I had come to see it all as\nan intellectual puzzle. Jasnah was so outwardly dispassionate that I assumed\nshe did the same.”\nShallan winced as she dug a bit of rock from a crack in her foot. More\npainspren wiggled out of the floor of the wagon. She wouldn’t be walking\ngreat distances anytime soon, but at least she didn’t see any rotspren yet.\nShe had better find some antiseptic.\n“Our danger isn’t just theoretical, Pattern. It is real and it is terrible.”\n“Yes,” Pattern said, voice sounding grave.\nShe looked up from her feet. He had moved up onto the inside of the\nchest’s lid, lit by the varied light of the differently colored spheres. “You\nknow something about the danger? The parshmen, the Voidbringers?”\nPerhaps she was reading too much into his tones. He wasn’t human, and\noften spoke with strange inflections.\n“My return…” Pattern said. “Because of this.”\n“What? Why haven’t you said something!”"

Why haven’t you said something!”\n“Say… speaking… Thinking… All hard. Getting better.”\n“You came to me because of the Voidbringers,” Shallan said, moving\ncloser to the trunk, bloodied rag forgotten in her hand.\n“Yes. Patterns… we… us… Worry. One was sent. Me.”\n“Why to me?”\n“Because of lies.”\nShe shook her head. “I don’t understand.”\nHe buzzed in dissatisfaction. “You. Your family.”\n“You watched me with my family? That long ago?”\n“Shallan. Remember…”\nAgain those memories. This time, not a garden seat, but a sterile white\nroom. Her father’s lullaby. Blood on the floor.\nNo.\nShe turned away and began cleaning her feet again.\n“I know… little of humans,” Pattern said. “They break. Their minds\nbreak. You did not break. Only cracked.”\nShe continued her washing.\n“It is the lies that save you,” Pattern said. “The lies that drew me.”\nShe dipped her rag in the bucket. “Do you have a name? I’ve called you\nPattern, but it’s more of a description.”\n“Name is numbers,” Pattern said. “Many numbers. Hard to say.\nPattern… Pattern is fine.”\n“As long as you don’t start calling me Erratic as a contrast,” Shallan\nsaid.\n“Mmmmmm…”\n“What does that mean?” she asked.\n“I am thinking,” Pattern said. “Considering the lie.”\n“The joke?”\n“Yes.”\n“Please don’t think too hard,” Shallan said. “It wasn’t a particularly\ngood joke. If you want to ponder a real one, consider that stopping the\nreturn of the Voidbringers might depend on me, of all people.”\n“Mmmmm…”\nShe finished with her feet as best she could, then wrapped them with\nseveral other cloths from the trunk. She had no slippers or shoes. Perhaps\nshe could buy an extra pair of boots from one of the slavers? The mere\nthought made her stomach churn, but she didn’t have a choice.\nNext, she sorted through the contents of the trunk. This was only one of\nJasnah’s trunks, but Shallan recognized it as the one the woman kept in her\nown cabin—the one the assassins had taken. It contained Jasnah’s notes:\nbooks and books full of them. The trunk contained few primary sources, but\nthat didn’t matter, as Jasnah had meticulously transcribed all relevant\npassages.\nAs Shallan set aside the last book, she noticed something on the bottom\nof the trunk. A loose piece of paper? She picked it up, curious—then nearly\ndropped it in surprise.\nIt was a picture of Jasnah, drawn by Shallan herself. Shallan had given\nit to the woman after being accepted as her ward. She’d assumed Jasnah\nhad thrown it away—the woman had little fondness for visual arts, which\nshe considered a frivolity.\nInstead, she’d kept it here with her most precious things. No. Shallan\ndidn’t want to think about that, didn’t want to face it.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “You cannot keep all lies. Only the most"

For Jasnah. She’d been\navoiding the grief, had stuffed it into a little box and set it away.\nAs soon as she let that grief come, another piled on top of it. A grief that\nseemed frivolous in comparison to Jasnah’s death, but one that threatened to\ntow Shallan down as much, or even more.\n“My sketchpads…” she whispered. “All gone.”\n“Yes,” Pattern said, sounding sorrowful.\n“Every drawing I’ve ever kept. My brothers, my father, Mother…” All\nsunk into the depths, along with her sketches of creatures and her musings\non their connections, biology, and nature. Gone. Every bit of it gone.\nThe world didn’t depend upon Shallan’s silly pictures of skyeels. She\nfelt as if everything was broken anyway.\n“You will draw more,” Pattern whispered.\n“I don’t want to.” Shallan blinked free more tears.\n“I will not stop vibrating. The wind will not stop blowing. You will not\nstop drawing.”\nShallan brushed her fingers across the picture of Jasnah. The woman’s\neyes were alight, almost alive again—it was the first picture Shallan had\ndrawn of Jasnah, done on the day they’d met. “The broken Soulcaster was\nwith my things. It’s now on the bottom of the ocean, lost. I won’t be able to\nrepair it and send it to my brothers.”\nPattern buzzed in what sounded like a morose tone to her.\n“Who are they?” Shallan asked. “The ones who did this, who killed her\nand took my art from me. Why would they do such horrible things?”\n“I do not know.”\n“But you are certain that Jasnah was right?” Shallan said. “The\nVoidbringers are going to return?”\n“Yes. Spren… spren of him. They come.”\n“These people,” Shallan said, “they killed Jasnah. They were probably\nof the same group as Kabsal, and… and as my father. Why would they kill\nthe person closest to understanding how, and why, the Voidbringers are\ncoming back?”\n“I…” He faltered.\n“I shouldn’t have asked,” Shallan said. “I already know the answer, and\nit is a very human one. These people seek to control the knowledge so that\nthey can profit from it. Profit from the apocalypse itself. We’re going to see\nthat doesn’t happen.”\nShe lowered the sketch of Jasnah, setting it between the pages of a book\nto keep it safe.\nScroll of Stances\n14.

The fop\nwith the nice clothing. Tinalar thought to duel me just to embarrass my\nfather. Instead I got his Blade.” If he’d lost, he would have had to give\nTinalar his Plate, which he’d inherited from his mother’s side of the family.\nAdolin had never named his Shardblade. Some did, some didn’t. He’d\nnever thought it appropriate—not because he didn’t think the Blade\ndeserved a name, but because he figured he didn’t know the right one. This\nweapon had belonged to one of the Knights Radiant, long ago. That man\nhad named the weapon, undoubtedly. To call it something else seemed\npresumptuous. Adolin had felt that way even before he’d started thinking of\nthe Radiants in a good light, as his father did.\nThis Blade would continue after Adolin died. He didn’t own it. He was\nborrowing it for a time.\nIts surface was austerely smooth, long, sinuous like an eel, with ridges\nat the back like growing crystals. Shaped like a larger version of a standard\nlongsword, it bore some resemblance to the enormous, two-handed\nbroadswords he’d seen Horneaters wield.\n“A real duel,” Adolin whispered to the Blade. “For real stakes. Finally.\nNo more tiptoeing around it, no more limiting myself.”\nThe Shardblade didn’t respond, but Adolin imagined that it listened to\nhim. You couldn’t use a weapon like this, a weapon that seemed like an\nextension of the soul itself, and not feel at times that it was alive.\n“I speak so confidently to everyone else,” Adolin said, “since I know\nthey rely on me. But if I lose today, that’s it. No more duels, and a severe\nknot in Father’s grand plan.”\nHe could hear people outside. Stomping feet, a buzz of chatter. Scraping\non the stone. They’d come. Come to see Adolin win or be humiliated.\n“This might be our last fight together,” Adolin said softly. “I appreciate\nwhat you’ve done for me. I know you’d do it for anyone who held you, but\nI still appreciate it. I… I want you to know: I believe in Father. I believe\nhe’s right, that the things he sees are real. That the world needs a united\nAlethkar. Fights like this one are my way to make it happen.”\nAdolin and his father weren’t politicians. They were soldiers—Dalinar\nby choice, Adolin more by circumstance. They wouldn’t be able to just talk\ntheir way into a unified kingdom. They’d have to fight their way into one.\nAdolin stood up, patting his pocket, then dismissing his Blade to mist\nand crossing the small chamber. The stone walls of the narrow hallway he\nentered were etched with reliefs depicting the ten basic stances of\nswordsmanship.

Adolin counted them off to\nhimself as he passed. This small tunnel had been cut into the stone of the\narena itself, and ended in a small room cut into the rock. The bright sunlight\nof the dueling grounds glared around the edges of the final pair of doors\nbetween him and his opponent.\nWith a proper preparation room for meditation, then this staging room\nto put on armor or retreat between bouts, the dueling arena at the warcamps\nwas transforming into one as proper as those back in Alethkar. A welcome\naddition.\nAdolin stepped into the staging room, where his brother and aunt were\nwaiting. Stormfather, his hands were sweating. He hadn’t felt this nervous\nwhen riding into battle, when his life was actually in danger.\nAunt Navani had just finished a glyphward. She stepped away from the\npedestal, setting aside her brushpen, and held up the ward for him to see. It\nwas painted in bright red on a white cloth.\n“Victory?” Adolin guessed.\nNavani lowered it, raising an eyebrow at him.\n“What?” Adolin said as his armorers entered, carrying the pieces of his\nShardplate.\n“It says ‘safety and glory,’” Navani said. “It wouldn’t kill you to learn\nsome glyphs, Adolin.”\nHe shrugged. “Never seemed that important.”\n“Yes, well,” Navani said, reverently folding the prayer and setting it in\nthe brazier to burn. “Hopefully, you will eventually have a wife to do this\nfor you. Both the reading of glyphs and the making of them.”\nAdolin bowed his head, as was proper while the prayer burned. Pailiah\nknew, this wasn’t the time to offend the Almighty. Once it was done,\nhowever, he glanced at Navani. “And what of the news of the ship?”\nThey had expected word from Jasnah when she reached the Shallow\nCrypts, but none had been forthcoming. Navani had checked in with the\nharbormaster’s office in that distant city. They said the Wind’s Pleasure had\nnot yet arrived. That put it a week overdue.\nNavani waved a dismissive hand. “Jasnah was on that ship.”\n“I know, Aunt,” Adolin said, shuffling uncomfortably. What had\nhappened? Had the ship been caught in a highstorm? What of this woman\nAdolin might be marrying, if Jasnah had her way?\n“If the ship is delayed, it’s because Jasnah is up to something,” Navani\nsaid. “Watch. We’ll get a communication from her in a few weeks,\ndemanding some task or piece of information. I’ll have to pry from her why\nshe vanished. Battah send that girl some sense to go with her intelligence.”\nAdolin didn’t press the issue. Navani knew Jasnah better than anyone\nelse. But… he was certainly concerned for Jasnah, and felt a sudden worry\nthat he might not get to meet the girl, Shallan, when expected.

Letting someone else choose for him had a strange appeal,\nconsidering how loudly Danlan had cursed at him when he’d broken off that\nparticular relationship.\nDanlan was still one of his father’s scribes, so he saw her on occasion.\nMore glares. But storm it, that one was not his fault. The things she’d said\nto her friends…\nAn armorer set out his boots, and Adolin stepped into them, feeling\nthem click into place. The armorers quickly affixed the greaves, then moved\nupward, covering him in too-light metal. Soon, all that remained were the\ngauntlets and the helm. He knelt down, placing his hands into the gauntlets\nat his side, fingers in their positions. In the strange manner of Shardplate,\nthe armor constricted on its own, like a skyeel curling around its rat, pulling\nto comfortable tightness around his wrists.\nHe turned and reached for his helm from the last armorer. It was\nRenarin.\n“You ate chicken?” Renarin asked as Adolin took the helm.\n“For breakfast.”\n“And you talked to the sword?”\n“Had an entire conversation.”\n“Mother’s chain in your pocket?”\n“Checked three times.”\nNavani folded her arms. “You still hold to those foolish superstitions?”\nBoth brothers looked at her sharply.\n“They’re not superstitions,” Adolin said at the same time Renarin said,\n“It’s just good luck, Aunt.”\nShe rolled her eyes.\n“I haven’t done a formal duel in a long time,” Adolin said, pulling on\nthe helm, faceplate open. “I don’t want anything to go wrong.”\n“Foolishness,” Navani repeated. “Trust in the Almighty and the Heralds,\nnot whether or not you had the right meal before you duel. Storms. Next\nthing I know, you’ll be believing in the Passions.”\nAdolin shared a look with Renarin. His little traditions probably didn’t\nhelp him win, but, well, why risk it? Every duelist had his own quirks. His\nhadn’t let him down yet.\n“Our guards aren’t happy about this,” Renarin said softly. “They keep\ntalking about how hard it’s going to be to protect you when someone else is\nswinging a Shardblade at you.”\nAdolin slammed down his faceplate. It misted at the sides, locking into\nplace, becoming translucent and giving him a full view of the room. Adolin\ngrinned, knowing full well Renarin couldn’t see the expression. “I’m so sad\nto be denying them the chance to babysit me.”\n“Why do you enjoy tormenting them?”\n“I don’t like minders.”\n“You’ve had guards before.”\n“On the battlefield,” Adolin said. It felt different to be followed about\neverywhere he went.\n“There’s more. Don’t lie to me, Brother. I know you too well.”\nAdolin inspected his brother, whose eyes were so earnest behind his\nspectacles. The boy was too solemn all the time.\n“I don’t like their captain,” Adolin admitted.\n“Why? He saved Father’s life.”"

That makes me suspicious.”\n“I think you don’t like that he ordered you around, on the battlefield.”\n“I barely even remember that,” Adolin said lightly, stepping toward the\ndoor out.\n“Well, all right then. Off with you. And Brother?”\n“Yes?”\n“Try not to lose.”\nAdolin pushed open the doors and stepped out onto the sand. He’d been\nin this arena before, using the argument that though the Alethi Codes of War\nproscribed duels between officers, he still needed to maintain his skills.\nTo placate his father, Adolin had stayed away from important bouts—\nbouts for championships or for Shards. He hadn’t dared risk his Blade and\nPlate. Now everything was different.\nThe air was still chill with winter, but the sun was bright overhead. His\nbreath sounded against the plate of his helm, and his feet crunched in sand.\nHe checked to see that his father was watching. He was. As was the king.\nSadeas hadn’t come. Just as well. That might have distracted Adolin\nwith memories of one of the last times that Sadeas and Dalinar had been\namiable, sitting together up on those stone steps, watching Adolin duel. Had\nSadeas been planning a betrayal even then, while laughing with his father\nand chatting like an old friend?\nFocus. His foe today wasn’t Sadeas, though someday… Someday soon\nhe’d get that man in the arena. It was the goal of everything he was doing\nhere.\nFor now, he’d have to settle for Salinor, one of Thanadal’s Shardbearers.\nThe man had only the Blade, though he’d been able to borrow a set of the\nKing’s Plate for a bout with a full Shardbearer.\nSalinor stood on the other side of the arena, wearing the unornamented\nslate-grey Plate and waiting for the highjudge—Brightlady Istow—to signal\nthe start of the bout. This fight was, in a way, an insult to Adolin. In order to\nget Salinor to agree to the duel, Adolin had been forced to bet both his Plate\nand his Blade against just Salinor’s Blade. As if Adolin weren’t worthy, and\nhad to offer more potential spoils to justify bothering Salinor.\nAs expected, the arena was overflowing with lighteyes. Even if it was\nspeculated that Adolin had lost his former edge, bouts for Shards were very,\nvery rare. This would be the first in over a year’s time.\n“Summon Blades!” Istow ordered.\nAdolin thrust his hand to the side. The Blade fell into his waiting hand\nten heartbeats later—a moment before his opponent’s appeared. Adolin’s\nheart was beating more quickly than Salinor’s. Perhaps that meant his\nopponent wasn’t frightened, and underestimated him.\nAdolin fell into Windstance, elbows bent, turned to the side, sword’s tip\npointing up and backward.

His opponent fell into Flamestance, sword held\none-handed, other hand touching the blade, standing with a square posture\nof the feet. The stances were more a philosophy than a predefined set of\nmoves. Windstance: flowing, sweeping, majestic. Flamestance: quick and\nflexible, better for shorter Shardblades.\nWindstance was familiar to Adolin. It had served him well throughout\nhis career.\nBut it didn’t feel right today.\nWe’re at war, Adolin thought as Salinor edged forward, looking to test\nhim. And every lighteyes in this army is a raw recruit.\nIt wasn’t time for a show.\nIt was time for a beating.\nAs Salinor drew close for a cautious strike to feel out his opponent,\nAdolin twisted and fell into Ironstance, with his sword held two-handed up\nbeside his head. He slapped away Salinor’s first strike, then stepped in and\nslammed his Blade down into the man’s helm. Once, twice, three times.\nSalinor tried to parry, but he was obviously surprised by Adolin’s attack,\nand two of the blows landed.\nCracks crawled across Salinor’s helm. Adolin heard grunts\naccompanying curses as Salinor tried to bring his weapon back to strike.\nThis wasn’t the way it was supposed to go. Where were the test blows, the\nart, the dance?\nAdolin growled, feeling the old Thrill of battle as he shoved aside\nSalinor’s attack—careless of the hit it scored on his side—then brought his\nBlade in two-handed and crashed it into his opponent’s breastplate, like he\nwas chopping wood. Salinor grunted again and Adolin raised his foot and\nkicked the man backward, throwing him to the ground.\nSalinor dropped his Blade—a weakness of Flamestance’s one-handed\nposture—and it vanished to mist. Adolin stepped over the man and\ndismissed his own Blade, then kicked down with a booted heel into\nSalinor’s helm. The piece of Plate exploded into molten bits, exposing a\ndazed, panicked face.\nAdolin slammed the heel of his foot against the breastplate next.\nThough Salinor tried to grab his foot, Adolin kicked relentlessly until the\nbreastplate, too, shattered.\n“Stop! Stop!”\nAdolin halted, lowering his foot beside Salinor’s head, looking up at the\nhighjudge. The woman stood in her box, face red, voice furious.\n“Adolin Kholin!” she shouted. “This is a duel, not a wrestling match!”\n“Did I break any rules?” he shouted back.\nSilence. It struck him, through the rush in his ears, that the entire crowd\nhad gone quiet. He could hear their breathing.\n“Did I break any rules?” Adolin demanded again.\n“This is not how a duel—”\n“So I win,” Adolin said.\nThe woman sputtered. “This duel was to three broken pieces of Plate.\nYou broke only two.”\nAdolin looked down at the dazed Salinor. Then he reached down, ripped\noff the man’s pauldron, and smashed it between two fists. “Done.”\nStunned silence."

His armor wouldn’t work properly, and he’d need to roll\nonto his side and work his way to his feet. Doable, but he obviously didn’t\nhave the experience with Plate to perform the maneuver. Adolin slammed\nhim back down to the sand by his shoulder.\n“You’ve lost,” Adolin growled.\n“You cheated!” Salinor sputtered.\n“How?”\n“I don’t know how! It just— It’s not supposed to…”\nHe trailed off as Adolin carefully placed a gauntleted hand against his\nneck. Salinor’s eyes widened. “You wouldn’t.”\nFearspren crawled out of the sand around him.\n“My prize,” Adolin said, suddenly feeling drained. The Thrill faded\nfrom him. Storms, he’d never before felt like this in a duel.\nSalinor’s Blade appeared in his hand.\n“Judgment,” the highjudge said, sounding reluctant, “goes to Adolin\nKholin, the victor. Salinor Eved forfeits his Shard.”\nSalinor let the Blade slip from his fingers. Adolin took it and knelt\nbeside Salinor, holding the weapon with pommel toward the man. “Break\nthe bond.”\nSalinor hesitated, then touched the ruby at the weapon’s pommel. The\ngemstone flashed with light. The bond had been broken.\nAdolin stood, ripping the ruby free, then crushing it in a gauntleted\nhand. That wouldn’t be needed, but it was a nice symbol. Sound finally rose\nin the crowd, frantic chattering. They’d come for a spectacle and had\ninstead been given brutality. Well, that was how things often went in war.\nGood for them to see it, he supposed, though as he ducked back into the\nwaiting room he was uncertain of himself. What he’d done was reckless.\nDismissing his Blade? Putting himself in a position where the enemy could\nhave gotten at his feet?\nAdolin entered the staging room, where Renarin looked at him wide-\neyed. “That,” his younger brother said, “was incredible. It has to be the\nshortest Shard bout on record! You were amazing, Adolin!”\n“I… Thanks.” He handed Salinor’s Shardblade toward Renarin. “A\npresent.”\n“Adolin, are you sure? I mean, I’m not exactly the best with the Plate I\nalready have.”\n“Might as well have the full set,” Adolin said. “Take it.”\nRenarin seemed hesitant.\n“Take it,” Adolin said again.\nReluctantly, Renarin did so. He grimaced as he took it. Adolin shook his\nhead, sitting down on one of the reinforced benches intended to hold a\nShardbearer. Navani stepped into the room, having come down from the\nseats above.\n“What you did,” she noted, “would not have worked on a more skillful\nopponent.”\n“I know,” Adolin said."

She felt extremely satisfied to have noticed the plants—it showed\nthat though she lacked much practical knowledge, some of her studies could\nbe useful in the wild.\nDid she confront him about his lie? What would it accomplish? He\ndidn’t seem to get embarrassed by such things. He watched her in the\ndarkness, eyes beady, shadowed.\n“Well,” Shallan said to him, “that is unfortunate. Perhaps in our travels\nwe will meet another merchant group with whom I can trade for proper\nfootwear.”\n“I will be certain to look for such an opportunity, Brightness.” Tvlakv\ngave her a bow and a fake smile, then continued toward the evening cook\nfire, which was burning fitfully—they were out of wood, and the parshmen\nhad gone out into the evening to search for more.\n“Lies,” Pattern said softly, his shape nearly invisible on the seat beside\nher.\n“He knows if I can’t walk, I’m more dependent upon him.”\nTvlakv settled down beside the struggling fire. Nearby, the chulls—\nunhooked from their wagons—lumbered around, crunching tiny rockbuds\nbeneath their gargantuan feet. They never strayed far.\nTvlakv started whispering quietly with Tag, the mercenary. He kept a\nsmile on his face, but she didn’t trust those dark eyes of his, glittering in the\nfirelight.\n“Go see what he’s saying,” Shallan told Pattern.\n“See… ?”\n“Listen to his words, then come back and repeat them to me. Don’t get\ntoo close to the light.”"

Don’t get\ntoo close to the light.”\nPattern moved down the side of the wagon. Shallan leaned back against\nthe hard seat, then took a small mirror she’d found in Jasnah’s trunk out of\nher safepouch along with a single sapphire sphere for light. Just a mark,\nnothing too bright, and it was failing at that. When is that next highstorm\ndue? Tomorrow?\nIt was nearing the start of a new year—and that meant the Weeping was\ncoming, though not for a number of weeks. It was a Light Year, wasn’t it?\nWell, she could endure highstorms out here. She’d already been forced to\nsuffer that indignity once, locked within her wagon.\nIn the mirror, she could see that she looked awful. Red eyes with bags\nunder them, her hair a frazzled mess, her dress frayed and soiled. She\nlooked like a beggar who had found a once-nice dress in a trash heap.\nIt didn’t bother her overly much. Was she worried about looking pretty\nfor slavers? Hardly. However, Jasnah hadn’t cared what people thought of\nher, yet had always kept her appearance immaculate. Not that Jasnah had\nacted alluringly—never for a moment. In fact, she’d disparaged such\nbehavior in no uncertain terms. Using a fetching face to make men do as\nyou wish is no different from a man using muscle to force a woman to his\nwill, she’d said. Both are base, and both will fail a person as they age.\nNo, Jasnah had not approved of seduction as a tool. However, people\nresponded differently to those who looked in control of themselves.\nBut what can I do? Shallan thought. I have no makeup; I don’t even\nhave shoes to wear.\n“… she could be someone important,” Tvlakv’s voice said abruptly\nnearby. Shallan jumped, then looked to the side, where Pattern now rested\non the seat beside her. The voice came from there.\n“She is trouble,” Tag’s voice said. Pattern’s vibrations produced a\nperfect imitation. “I still think we should just leave her and go.”\n“It is fortunate for us,” Tvlakv’s voice said, “that the decision is not\nyours. You worry about making dinner. I shall worry about our little\nlighteyed companion. Someone is missing her, someone rich. If we can sell\nher back to them, Tag, it could be what finally digs us out.”\nPattern imitated the sounds of a crackling fire for a short time, then fell\nsilent.\nThe precise reproduction of the conversation was marvelous. This,\nShallan thought, could be very useful.\nUnfortunately, something needed to be done about Tvlakv. She couldn’t\nhave him regarding her as something to be sold back to those missing her—\nthat was discomfortingly close to viewing her as a slave. If she let him\ncontinue in such a mindset, she’d spend the entire trip worrying about him\nand his thugs.\nSo what would Jasnah do, in this situation?\nGritting her teeth, Shallan slipped down off the wagon, stepping\ngingerly on her wounded feet.

She waited for the\npainspren to retreat, then—covering up her agony—she approached the\nmeager fire and sat down. “Tag, you are excused.”\nHe looked to Tvlakv, who nodded. Tag retreated to check on the\nparshmen. Bluth had gone to scout the area, as he often did at night,\nchecking for signs of others passing this way.\n“It is time to discuss your payment,” Shallan said.\n“Service to one so illustrious is payment in itself, of course.”\n“Of course,” she said, meeting his eyes. Don’t back down. You can do\nthis. “But a merchant must make a living. I am not blind, Tvlakv. Your men\ndo not agree with your decision to help me. They think it a waste.”\nTvlakv glanced at Tag, looking unsettled. Hopefully, he wondered what\nelse she had guessed.\n“Upon arriving at the Shattered Plains,” Shallan said, “I will acquire a\ngrand fortune. I do not have it yet.”\n“That is… unfortunate.”\n“Not in the slightest,” Shallan said. “It is an opportunity, tradesman\nTvlakv. The fortune I will acquire is the result of a betrothal. If I arrive\nsafely, those who rescued me—saved me from pirates, sacrificed greatly to\nsee me brought to my new family—will undoubtedly be well rewarded.”\n“I am but a humble servant,” Tvlakv said with a broad, false smile.\n“Rewards are the farthest thing from my mind.”\nHe thinks I’m lying about the fortune. Shallan ground her teeth in\nfrustration, anger beginning to burn inside of her. This was just what Kabsal\nhad done! Treating her like a plaything, a means to an end, not a real\nperson.\nShe leaned closer to Tvlakv into the firelight. “Do not toy with me,\nslaver.”\n“I wouldn’t dare—”\n“You have no idea the storm you have wandered into,” Shallan hissed,\nholding his eyes. “You have no idea what stakes have been wagered upon\nmy arrival. Take your petty schemes and stuff them in a crevice. Do as I\nsay, and I will see your debts canceled. You will be a free man again.”\n“What? How… how did you—”\nShallan stood up, cutting him off. She felt somehow stronger than she\nhad before. More determined. Her insecurities fluttered in the pit of her\nstomach, but she paid them no heed.\nTvlakv didn’t know she was timid. He didn’t know she had been raised\nin rural isolation. To him, she was a woman of the court, accomplished at\nargument and accustomed to being obeyed.\nStanding before him, feeling radiant in the glow of the flames—\ntowering above him and his grubby machinations—she saw. Expectation\nwasn’t just about what people expected of you.\nIt was about what you expected of yourself.\nTvlakv leaned away from her like a man before a raging bonfire.

Shallan realized that she was\nglowing faintly with the light of spheres. Her dress no longer bore the tears\nand smudges it had before. It was majestic.\nInstinctively, she let the glow from her skin fade, hoping Tvlakv would\nthink it a trick of the firelight. She spun and left him shaking beside the fire\nas she walked back to the wagon. Darkness was fully upon them, the first\nmoon having yet to rise. As she walked, her feet didn’t hurt nearly as much\nas they had. Was the knobweed sap doing that much good?\nShe reached the wagon and began climbing back into the seat, but Bluth\nchose that moment to crash into camp.\n“Put out the fire!” he cried.\nTvlakv looked at him dumbfounded.\nBluth dashed ahead, passing Shallan and reaching the fire, where he\ngrabbed the pot of steaming broth. He turned it over onto the flames,\nsplashing out ashes and steam with a hiss, scattering flamespren, which\nfaded away.\nTvlakv jumped up, looking down as filthy broth—faintly lit by the\ndying embers—ran past his feet. Shallan, gritting her teeth against the pain,\ngot off the wagon and approached. Tag ran up from the other direction.\n“… seem to be several dozen of them,” Bluth was saying in a low voice.\n“They are well armed, but have no horses or chulls, so they are not rich.”\n“What is this?” Shallan demanded.\n“Bandits,” Bluth said. “Or mercenaries. Or whatever you want to call\nthem.”\n“Nobody polices this area, Brightness,” Tvlakv said. He glanced at her,\nthen looked away quickly, obviously still shaken. “It is truly a wilderness,\nyou see. The presence of the Alethi on the Shattered Plains means many like\nto come and go. Trading caravans like ours, craftsmen seeking work,\nlowborn lighteyed sellswords with an eye toward enlisting. Those two\nconditions—no laws, but plenty of travelers—attract a certain kind of\nruffian.”\n“Dangerous,” Tag agreed. “These types take what they want. Leave\nonly corpses.”\n“Did they see our fire?” Tvlakv asked, wringing his cap in his hands.\n“Don’t know,” Bluth said, glancing over his shoulder. Shallan could\nbarely make out his expression in the darkness. “Didn’t want to get close. I\nsnuck up to get a count, then ran back here fast.”\n“How can you be sure they’re bandits?” Shallan asked. “They might\njust be soldiers on their way to the Shattered Plains, as Tvlakv said.”\n“They fly no banners, display no sigils,” Bluth said. “But they have\ngood equipment and keep a tight guard. They’re deserters. I’d bet the chulls\non it.”\n“Bah,” Tvlakv said. “You’d bet my chulls on a hand with the tower,\nBluth. But Brightness, for all his terrible gambling sense, I believe the fool"

We must harness the chulls and depart immediately. The night’s\ndarkness is our ally, and we must make the most of it.”\nShe nodded. The men moved quickly, even the portly Tvlakv, breaking\ndown camp and hooking up the chulls. The slaves grumbled at not getting\ntheir food for the night. Shallan stopped beside their cage, feeling ashamed.\nHer family had owned slaves—and not just parshmen and ardents. Ordinary\nslaves. In most cases, they were nothing worse than darkeyes without the\nright of travel.\nThese poor souls, however, were sickly and half-starved.\nYou’re only one step from being in one of those pens yourself, Shallan,\nshe thought with a shiver as Tvlakv passed, hissing curses at the captives.\nNo. He wouldn’t dare put you in there. He’d just kill you.\nBluth had to be reminded again to give her a hand up into the wagon.\nTag ushered the parshmen into their wagon, cursing at them for moving so\nslowly, then climbed into his seat and took up the tail position.\nThe first moon began to rise, making it lighter than Shallan would have\nliked. It seemed to her that each crunching footstep of the chulls was as\nloud as a highstorm’s thunder. They brushed the plants she’d named\ncrustspines, with their branches like tubes of sandstone. Those cracked and\nshook.\nProgress was not quick—chulls never were. As they moved, she picked\nout lights on a hillside, frighteningly close. Campfires not a ten-minute\nwalk away. A shifting of winds brought the sound of distant voices, of metal\non metal, perhaps men sparring.\nTvlakv turned the wagons eastward. Shallan frowned in the night. “Why\nthis way?” she whispered.\n“Remember that gully we saw?” Bluth whispered. “Putting it between\nus and them, in case they hear and come looking.”\nShallan nodded. “What can we do if they catch us?”\n“It won’t be good.”\n“Couldn’t we bribe our way past them?”\n“Deserters ain’t like common bandits,” Bluth said. “These men, they’ve\ngiven up everything. Oaths. Families. When you desert, it breaks you. It\nleaves you willing to do anything, because you’ve already given away\neverything you could have cared about losing.”\n“Wow,” Shallan said, looking over her shoulder.\n“I… Yeah, you spend your whole life with a decision like that, you do.\nYou wish any honor were left for you, but know you’ve already given it\naway.”\nHe fell silent, and Shallan was too nervous to prod him further. She\ncontinued watching those lights on the hillside as the wagons—blessedly—\nrolled farther and farther into the night, eventually escaping into the\ndarkness.\n16.

Swordmaster\nNimbleform has a delicate touch.\nGave the gods this form to many,\nTho’ once defied, by the gods they were\ncrushed.\nThis form craves precision and plenty.\nFrom the Listener Song of Listing, 27th\nstanza\n“You know,” Moash said from Kaladin’s side, “I always thought this\nplace would be…”\n“Bigger?” Drehy offered in his lightly accented voice.\n“Better,” Moash said, looking around the practice grounds. “It looks just\nlike where darkeyed soldiers practice.”\nThese sparring grounds were reserved for Dalinar’s lighteyes. In the\ncenter, the large open courtyard was filled with a thick layer of sand. A\nraised wooden walkway ran around the perimeter, stretching between the\nsand and the narrow surrounding building, which was just one room deep.\nThat narrow building wrapped around the courtyard except at the front,\nwhich had a wall with an archway for the entrance, and had a wide roof that\nextended, giving shade to the wooden walkway. Lighteyed officers stood\nchatting in the shade or watching men sparring in the sunlight of the yard,\nand ardents moved this way and that, delivering weapons or drinks.\nIt was a common layout for training grounds. Kaladin had been in\nseveral buildings like this. Mostly back when he’d first been training in\nAmaram’s army.\nKaladin set his jaw, resting his fingers on the archway leading into the\ntraining grounds. It had been seven days since Amaram’s arrival in the\nwarcamps. Seven days of dealing with the fact that Amaram and Dalinar\nwere friends.\nHe’d decided to be storming happy about Amaram’s arrival. After all, it\nmeant that Kaladin would be able to find a chance to finally stick a spear in\nthat man.\nNo, he thought, entering the training grounds, not a spear. A knife. I\nwant to be up close to him, face-to-face, so I can watch him panic as he\ndies. I want to feel that knife going in.\nKaladin waved to his men and entered through the archway, forcing\nhimself to focus on his surroundings instead of Amaram. That archway was\ngood stone, quarried nearby, built into a structure with the traditional\neastward reinforcement. Judging by the modest crem deposits, these walls\nhadn’t been here long. It was another sign that Dalinar was starting to think\nof the warcamps as permanent—he was taking down simple, temporary\nbuildings and replacing them with sturdy structures.\n“I don’t know what you expected,” Drehy said to Moash as he inspected\nthe grounds. “How would you make sparring grounds different for the\nlighteyes? Use diamond dust instead of sand?”\n“Ouch,” Kaladin said.\n“I don’t know how,” Moash said. “It’s just that they make such a big\ndeal of it. No darkeyes on the ‘special’ sparring grounds. I don’t see what\nmakes them special.”\n“That’s because you don’t think like lighteyes,” Kaladin said. “This\nplace is special for one simple reason.”\n“Why’s that?” Moash asked.\n“Because we’re not here,” Kaladin said, leading the way in. “Not\nnormally, at least.”\nHe had with him Drehy and Moash, along with five other men, a mix of"

Dalinar\nhad assigned those to Kaladin, and to Kaladin’s surprise and pleasure, they\nhad accepted him as their leader without a word of complaint. To a man,\nhe’d been impressed with them. The old Guard had deserved its reputation.\nA few, all darkeyed, had started eating with Bridge Four. They’d asked\nfor Bridge Four patches, and Kaladin had gotten them some—but ordered\nthem to put their Cobalt Guard patches on the other shoulder, and continue\nto wear them as a mark of pride.\nSpear in hand, Kaladin led his team toward a group of ardents who\nbustled in their direction. The ardents wore Vorin religious garb—loose\ntrousers and tunics, tied at the waist with simple ropes. Pauper’s clothing.\nThey were slaves, and then they also weren’t. Kaladin had never given\nmuch thought to them. His mother would probably lament how little\nKaladin cared for religious observance. The way Kaladin figured it, the\nAlmighty didn’t show much concern for him, so why care back?\n“This is the lighteyes’ training ground,” said the lead ardent sternly. She\nwas a willowy woman, though you weren’t supposed to think of ardents as\nmale or female. She had her head shaven, like all ardents. Her male\ncompanions wore square beards with clean upper lips.\n“Captain Kaladin, Bridge Four,” Kaladin said, scanning the practice\ngrounds and shouldering his spear. It would be very easy for an accident to\nhappen here, during sparring. He’d have to watch for that. “Here to guard\nthe Kholin boys while they practice today.”\n“Captain?” one of the ardents scoffed. “You—”\nAnother ardent silenced him by whispering something. News about\nKaladin had traveled quickly through camp, but ardents could be an isolated\nlot, sometimes.\n“Drehy,” Kaladin said, pointing. “See those rockbuds growing up on the\ntop of the wall there?”\n“Yup.”\n“They’re cultivated. That means there’s a way up.”\n“Of course there is,” the lead ardent said. “The stairwell is at the\nnorthwestern corner. I have the key.”\n“Good, you can let him in,” Kaladin said. “Drehy, keep an eye on things\nfrom up there.”\n“On it,” Drehy said, trotting in the direction of the stairwell.\n“And what kinds of danger do you expect them to be in here?” the\nardent said, folding her arms.\n“I see lots of weapons,” Kaladin said, “lots of people moving in and out,\nand… are those Shardblades I see? I wonder what could possibly go\nwrong.” He gave her a pointed look. The woman sighed, then handed her\nkey to an assistant, who jogged off after Drehy.\nKaladin pointed to positions for his other men to watch from. They\nmoved off, leaving only him and Moash.

The lean man had turned\nimmediately at the mention of Shardblades, and now watched them\nhungrily. A pair of lighteyed men bearing them had moved out into the\ncenter of the sands. One Blade was long and thin, with a large crossguard,\nwhile the other was wide and enormous, with wicked spikes—slightly\nflamelike—jutting out of both sides along the lower third. Both weapons\nhad protective strips on the edges, like a partial sheath.\n“Huh,” Moash said, “I don’t recognize either of those men. I thought I\nknew all the Shardbearers in camp.”\n“They aren’t Shardbearers,” the ardent said. “They’re using the King’s\nBlades.”\n“Elhokar lets people use his Shardblade?” Kaladin asked.\n“It is a grand tradition,” the ardent said, seeming annoyed that she had\nto explain. “The highprinces used to do it in their own princedoms, before\nthe reunification, and now it is the king’s obligation and honor. Men may\nuse the King’s Blade and Plate to practice. The lighteyes of our armies must\nbe trained with Shards, for the good of all. Blade and Plate are difficult to\nmaster, and if a Shardbearer falls in battle, it is important that others be\ncapable of their immediate use.”\nThat made sense, Kaladin supposed, though he found it hard to imagine\nany lighteyes letting someone else touch his Blade. “The king has two\nShardblades?”\n“One is that of his father, kept for the tradition of training\nShardbearers.” The ardent glanced at the sparring men. “Alethkar has\nalways had the finest Shardbearers in the world. This tradition is part of it.\nThe king has hinted that someday, he might bestow his father’s Blade upon\na worthy warrior.”\nKaladin nodded in appreciation. “Not bad,” he said. “I’ll bet that a lot of\nmen come to practice with them, each hoping to prove he’s the most skilled\nand most deserving. A good way for Elhokar to trick a bunch of men into\ntraining.”\nThe ardent huffed and walked away. Kaladin watched the Shardblades\nflash in the air. The men using them barely knew what they were doing. The\nreal Shardbearers he’d seen, the real Shardbearers he’d fought, hadn’t\nlurched about swinging the oversized swords like polearms. Even Adolin’s\nduel the other day had—\n“Storms, Kaladin,” Moash said, watching the ardent stalk away. “And\nyou were telling me to be respectful?”\n“Hmm?”\n“You didn’t use an honorific for the king,” Moash said. “Then you\nimplied that the lighteyes coming to practice were lazy and needed to be\ntricked into it. I thought we were supposed to avoid antagonizing the\nlighteyes?”\nKaladin looked away from the Shardbearers. Distracted, he’d spoken\nthoughtlessly. “You’re right,” he said. “Thanks for the reminder.”\nMoash nodded.\n“I want you by the gate,” Kaladin said, pointing. A group of parshmen\ncame in, bearing boxes, probably foodstuffs. Those wouldn’t be dangerous."

A knife to the side from someone like that would be one of the best\nways to pull off an assassination.”\n“Fine. But tell me something, Kal. Who is this Amaram fellow?”\nKaladin turned sharply toward Moash.\n“I see how you look at him,” Moash said. “I see how your face gets\nwhen the other bridgemen mention him. What did he do to you?”\n“I was in his army,” Kaladin said. “The last place I fought, before…”\nMoash gestured to Kaladin’s forehead. “That’s his work, then?”\n“Yeah.”\n“So he’s not the hero people say he is,” Moash said. He seemed pleased\nby that fact.\n“His soul is as dark as any I’ve ever known.”\nMoash took Kaladin by the arm. “We are going to get back at them\nsomehow. Sadeas, Amaram. The ones who have done these things to us?”\nAngerspren boiled up around him, like pools of blood in the sand.\nKaladin met Moash’s eyes, then nodded.\n“Good enough for me,” Moash said, shouldering his spear and jogging\noff toward the position Kaladin had indicated, the spren vanishing.\n“He’s another who needs to learn to smile more,” Syl whispered.\nKaladin hadn’t noticed her flitting nearby, and now she settled down on his\nshoulder.\nKaladin turned to walk around the perimeter of the practice grounds,\nnoting each entrance. Perhaps he was being overly cautious. He just liked\ndoing jobs well, and it had been a lifetime since he’d had a job other than\nsaving Bridge Four.\nSometimes, though, it seemed like his job was impossible to do well.\nDuring the highstorm last week, someone had again sneaked into Dalinar’s\nrooms, scrawling a second number on the wall. Counting it down, it pointed\nat the same date a little over a month away.\nThe highprince didn’t seem worried, and wanted the event kept quiet.\nStorms… was he writing the glyphs himself while he had fits? Or was it\nsome kind of spren? Kaladin was sure nobody could have gotten past him\nthis time to get in.\n“Do you want to talk about the thing that is bothering you?” Syl asked\nfrom her perch.\n“I’m worried about what’s happening during the highstorms with\nDalinar,” Kaladin said. “Those numbers… something is wrong. You still\nseeing those spren about?”\n“Red lightning?” she asked. “I think so. They’re hard to spot. You\nhaven’t seen them?”\nKaladin shook his head, hefting his spear and walking over onto the\nwalkway around the sands. Here, he peeked into a storage room. Wooden\npractice swords, some the size of Shardblades, and sparring leathers lined\nthe wall.\n“Is that all that’s bothering you?” Syl asked.\n“What else would be?”\n“Amaram and Dalinar.”"

Dalinar Kholin is friends with one of the worst\nmurderers I’ve ever met. So? Dalinar is lighteyed. He’s probably friends\nwith a lot of murderers.”\n“Kaladin…” Syl said.\n“Amaram’s worse than Sadeas, you know,” Kaladin said, walking\naround the storage room, checking for doorways. “Everyone knows that\nSadeas is a rat. He’s straight with you. ‘You’re a bridgeman,’ he told me,\n‘and I’m going to use you up until you die.’ Amaram, though… He\npromised to be more, a brightlord like those in the stories. He told me he’d\nprotect Tien. He feigned honor. That’s worse than any depth Sadeas could\never reach.”\n“Dalinar’s not like Amaram,” Syl said. “You know he’s not.”\n“People say the same things about him that they did of Amaram. That\nthey still do of Amaram.” Kaladin stepped back out into the sunlight and\ncontinued his circuit of the grounds, passing dueling lighteyes who kicked\nup sand as they grunted, sweated, and clacked wooden swords against one\nanother.\nEach pair was attended by a half-dozen darkeyed servants carrying\ntowels and canteens—and many had a parshman or two bring them chairs\nto sit on when they rested. Stormfather. Even in something routine like this,\nthe lighteyes had to be pampered.\nSyl zipped out into the air in front of Kaladin, coming down like a\nstorm. Literally like a storm. She stopped in the air right in front of him, a\ncloud boiling from beneath her feet, flashing with lightning. “You can\nhonestly say,” she demanded, “that you think Dalinar Kholin is only\npretending to be honorable?”\n“I—”\n“Don’t you lie to me, Kaladin,” she said, stepping forward, pointing.\nDiminutive though she was, in that moment, she seemed as vast as a\nhighstorm. “No lies. Ever.”\nHe took a deep breath. “No,” he finally said. “No, Dalinar gave up his\nBlade for us. He’s a good man. I accept that. Amaram has him fooled. He\nhad me fooled too, so I suppose I can’t blame Kholin too much.”\nSyl nodded curtly, the cloud dissipating. “You should talk to him about\nAmaram,” she said, walking in the air beside Kaladin’s head as he\ncontinued scouting the structure. Her steps were small, and she should have\nfallen behind, but she didn’t.\n“And what should I say?” Kaladin asked. “Should I go to him and\naccuse a lighteyes of the third dahn of murdering his own troops? Of\nstealing my Shardblade? I’ll sound like either a fool or a madman.”\n“But—”\n“He won’t listen, Syl,” Kaladin said. “Dalinar Kholin might be a good\nman, but he won’t let me speak ill of a powerful lighteyes. It’s the way of"

And that is truth.”\nHe continued his inspection, wanting to know what was in the rooms\nwhere people could watch people spar. Some were for storage, others for\nbathing and resting. Several of those were locked, with lighteyes inside\nrecovering from their daily sparring. Lighteyes liked baths.\nThe back side of the structure, opposite the entrance gate, held the\nliving quarters for the ardents. Kaladin had never seen so many shaved\nheads and robed bodies scurrying about. Back in Hearthstone, the citylord\nhad kept only a few wizened old ardents for tutoring his son. Those had also\ncome down to the town periodically to burn prayers and elevate darkeyes’\nCallings.\nThese ardents didn’t seem to be the same type. They had the physiques\nof warriors, and would often step in to practice with lighteyes who needed a\nsparring partner. Some of the ardents had dark eyes, but still used the sword\n—they weren’t considered lighteyed or darkeyed. They were just ardents.\nAnd what do I do if one of them decides to try killing the princelings?\nStorms, but he hated some aspects of bodyguard duty. If nothing happened,\nthen you were never sure if it was because nothing was wrong, or because\nyou had deterred potential assassins.\nAdolin and his brother finally arrived, both fully armored in their\nShardplate, helms under their arms. They were accompanied by Skar and a\nhandful of former members of the Cobalt Guard. Those saluted Kaladin as\nhe walked up and gestured that they were dismissed, the shift officially\nchanged. Skar would be off to join Teft and the group protecting Dalinar\nand Navani.\n“The area is as secure as I can make it without disrupting training,\nBrightlord,” Kaladin said, walking up to Adolin. “My men and I will keep\nan eye out while you spar, but don’t hesitate to give a holler if something\nseems amiss.”\nAdolin grunted, surveying the place, barely paying Kaladin any heed.\nHe was a tall man, his few black Alethi hairs overwhelmed by quite a bit of\ngolden blond. His father didn’t have that. Adolin’s mother had been from\nRira, perhaps?\nKaladin turned to walk toward the northern side of the courtyard, where\nhe’d have a different view from Moash.\n“Bridgeman,” Adolin called. “You’ve decided to start using proper titles\nfor people? Didn’t you call my father ‘sir’?”\n“He’s in my chain of command,” Kaladin said, turning back. The simple\nanswer seemed the best.\n“And I’m not?” Adolin asked, frowning.\n“No.”\n“And if I give you an order?”\n“I’ll comply with any reasonable requests, Brightlord. But if you wish\nfor someone to fetch you tea between bouts, you’ll have to send someone\nelse. There should be plenty here willing to lick your heels.”\nAdolin stepped up to him.

        "text": "else. There should be plenty here willing to lick your heels.”\nAdolin stepped up to him. Though the deep blue Shardplate added only\na few inches to his height, he seemed to tower because of it. Perhaps that\nline about licking heels had been brash.\nAdolin represented something, though. The privilege of the lighteyes.\nHe wasn’t like Amaram or Sadeas, who brought out Kaladin’s hatred. Men\nlike Adolin just annoyed him, reminding him that in this world, some\nsipped wine and wore fancy clothing while others were made slaves almost\non a whim.\n“I owe you my life,” Adolin growled, as if it hurt to say the words.\n“That’s the only reason I haven’t yet thrown you through a window.” He\nreached up with a gauntleted finger and tapped at Kaladin’s chest. “But my\npatience with you won’t extend as far as my father’s, little bridgeman.\nThere’s something off about you, something I can’t put my finger on. I’m\nwatching you. Remember your place.”\nGreat. “I’ll keep you alive, Brightlord,” Kaladin said, pushing aside the\nfinger. “That’s my place.”\n“I can keep myself alive,” Adolin said, turning away and tromping\nacross the sand with a clink of Plate. “Your job is to watch over my\nbrother.”\nKaladin was more than happy to let him leave. “Spoiled child,” he\nmuttered. Kaladin supposed that Adolin was a few years older than him.\nJust recently, Kaladin had realized that he’d passed his twentieth birthday\nwhile a bridgeman, and never known it. Adolin was in his early twenties.\nBut being a child had little to do with age.\nRenarin still stood awkwardly near the front gate, wearing Dalinar’s\nformer Shardplate, carrying his newly won Shardblade. Adolin’s quick duel\nfrom yesterday was the talk of the warcamps, and it would take Renarin\nfive days to fully bond his Blade before he could dismiss it.\nThe young man’s Shardplate was the color of dark steel, unpainted. That\nwas how Dalinar had preferred it. By giving his Plate away, Dalinar\nsuggested that he felt he needed to win his next victories as a politician. It\nwas a laudable move; you couldn’t always have men following you because\nthey feared you could beat them up—or even because you were the best\nsoldier among them. You needed more, far more, to be a true leader.\nYet Kaladin did wish Dalinar had kept the Plate. Anything that helped\nthe man stay alive would have been a boon for Bridge Four.\nKaladin leaned back against a column, folding his arms, spear in the\ncrook of his arm, watching the area for trouble and inspecting everyone that\ngot too close to the princelings. Adolin walked over and grabbed his brother\nby the shoulder, towing him across the courtyard. Various people sparring in\nthe square stopped and bowed—if not in uniform—or saluted the\nprincelings as they passed. A group of grey-clothed ardents had gathered at\nthe back of the courtyard, and the woman from earlier stepped forward to\nchat with the brothers. Adolin and Renarin both bowed formally to her.\nIt had been three weeks now since Renarin had been given his Plate."

Adolin and Renarin both bowed formally to her.\nIt had been three weeks now since Renarin had been given his Plate.\nWhy had Adolin waited so long to bring him here for training? Had he been\nwaiting until the duel, so he could win the lad a Blade too?\nSyl landed on Kaladin’s shoulder. “Adolin and Renarin are both bowing\nto her.”\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said.\n“But isn’t the ardent a slave? One their father owns?”\nKaladin nodded.\n“Humans don’t make sense.”\n“If you’re only now learning that,” Kaladin said, “then you haven’t been\npaying attention.”\nSyl tossed her hair, which moved realistically. The gesture itself was\nvery human. Perhaps she’d been paying attention after all. “I don’t like\nthem,” she said airily. “Either one. Adolin or Renarin.”\n“You don’t like anyone who carries Shards.”\n“Exactly.”\n“You called the Blades abominations before,” Kaladin said. “But the\nRadiants carried them. So were the Radiants wrong to do so?”\n“Of course not,” she said, sounding like he was saying something\ncompletely stupid. “The Shards weren’t abominations back then.”\n“What changed?”\n“The knights,” Syl said, growing quiet. “The knights changed.”\n“So it’s not that the weapons are abominations specifically,” Kaladin\nsaid. “It’s that the wrong people are carrying them.”\n“There are no right people anymore,” Syl whispered. “Maybe there\nnever were…”\n“And where did they come from in the first place?” Kaladin asked.\n“Shardblades. Shardplate. Even modern fabrials are nowhere near as good.\nSo where did the ancients get weapons so amazing?”\nSyl fell silent. She had a frustrating habit of doing that when his\nquestions got too specific.\n“Well?” he prompted.\n“I wish I could tell you.”\n“Then do.”\n“I wish it worked that way. It doesn’t.”\nKaladin sighed, turning his attention back to Adolin and Renarin, where\nit was supposed to be. The senior ardent had led them to the very back of\nthe courtyard, where another group of people sat on the ground. They were\nardents too, but something was different about them. Teachers of some sort?\nAs Adolin spoke to them, Kaladin did another quick scan around the\ncourtyard, then frowned.\n“Kaladin?” Syl asked.\n“Man in the shadows over there,” Kaladin said, gesturing with his spear\ntoward a place under the eaves. A man stood there, leaning cross-armed\nagainst a waist-high wooden railing. “He’s watching the princelings.”\n“Um, so is everyone else.”\n“He’s different,” Kaladin said. “Come on.”\nKaladin wandered over casually, unthreatening. The man was probably\njust a servant. Long-haired, with a short but scruffy black beard, he wore\nloose tan clothing tied with ropes. He looked out of place in the sparring\nyard, and that itself was probably enough to indicate he wasn’t an assassin.\nThe best assassins never stood out.\nStill, the man had a robust build and a scar on his cheek.

So he’d seen\nfighting. Best to check on him. The man watched Renarin and Adolin\nintently and, from this angle, Kaladin couldn’t see if his eyes were light or\ndark.\nAs Kaladin got close, his foot audibly scraped the sand. The man spun\nimmediately, and Kaladin leveled his spear by instinct. He could see the\nman’s eyes now—they were brown—but Kaladin had trouble placing his\nage. Those eyes seemed old somehow, but the man’s skin didn’t seem\nwrinkled enough to match them. He could have been thirty-five. Or he\ncould have been seventy.\nToo young, Kaladin thought, though he couldn’t say why.\nKaladin lowered his spear. “Sorry, I’m a little jumpy. First few weeks on\nthe job.” He tried to say it disarmingly.\nIt didn’t work. The man looked him up and down, still showing the\nchained menace of a warrior deciding whether or not to strike. Finally, he\nturned away from Kaladin and relaxed, watching Adolin and Renarin.\n“Who are you?” Kaladin asked, stepping up beside the man. “I’m new,\nas I said. I’m trying to learn everyone’s names.”\n“You’re the bridgeman. The one who saved the highprince.”\n“I am,” Kaladin said.\n“You don’t need to keep prying,” the man said. “I’m not going to hurt\nyour Damnation prince.” He had a low, grinding voice. Scratchy. Strange\naccent too.\n“He’s not my prince,” Kaladin said. “Just my responsibility.” He looked\nthe man over again, noticing something. The light clothing, tied with ropes,\nwas very similar to what some of the ardents were wearing. The full head of\nhair had thrown Kaladin off.\n“You’re a soldier,” Kaladin guessed. “Ex-soldier, I mean.”\n“Yeah,” the man said. “They call me Zahel.”\nKaladin nodded, the irregularities clicking into place. Occasionally, a\nsoldier retired to the ardentia, if he had no other life to return to. Kaladin\nwould have expected them to require the man to at least shave his head.\nI wonder if Hav is in one of these monasteries somewhere, Kaladin\nthought idly. What would he think of me now? He’d probably be proud. He\nalways had seen guard duty as the most respectable of a soldier’s\nassignments.\n“What are they doing?” Kaladin asked Zahel, nodding toward Renarin\nand Adolin—who, despite the encumbrance of their Shardplate, had seated\nthemselves on the ground before the elder ardents.\nZahel grunted. “The younger Kholin has to be chosen by a master. For\ntraining.”\n“Can’t they just pick whichever one they want?”\n“Doesn’t work that way. It’s kind of an awkward situation, though.\nPrince Renarin, he’s never practiced much with a sword.” Zahel paused.\n“Being chosen by a master is a step that most lighteyed boys of suitable\nrank take by the time they’re ten.”\nKaladin frowned. “Why didn’t he ever train?”"

Not brave enough.” The man\nnarrowed his eyes as Adolin stood up and gestured. “Damnation. I knew it\nwas suspicious that he waited for this until I got back.”\n“Swordmaster Zahel!” Adolin called. “You aren’t sitting with the\nothers!”\nZahel sighed, then gave Kaladin a resigned glance. “I’m probably not\nbrave enough either. I’ll try not to hurt him too much.” He walked around\nthe railing and jogged over. Adolin clasped Zahel’s hand eagerly, then\npointed to Renarin. Zahel looked distinctly out of place among the other\nardents with their bald heads, neatly trimmed beards, and cleaner clothing.\n“Huh,” Kaladin said. “Did he seem odd to you?”\n“You all seem odd to me,” Syl said lightly. “Everyone but Rock, who is\na complete gentleman.”\n“He thinks you’re a god. You shouldn’t encourage him.”\n“Why not? I am a god.”\nHe turned his head, looking at her flatly as she sat on his shoulder.\n“Syl…”\n“What? I am!” She grinned and held up her fingers, as if pinching\nsomething very small. “A little piece of one. Very, very little. You have\npermission to bow to me now.”\n“Kind of hard to do when you’re sitting on my shoulder,” he mumbled.\nHe noticed Lopen and Shen arriving at the gate, likely bearing the daily\nreports from Teft. “Come on.

That made the animal slow as\nthe wagon in front of them—driven by Tvlakv—began moving up a hillside\ncovered in tiny rockbuds.\n“You see?” Shallan said, showing him the leaf. “That’s why the plant’s\nlimbs are so fragile. When the storm comes, it will shatter these branches\nand break off the leaves. They will blow away and start new shoots,\nbuilding their own shell. They grow so quickly. Faster than I’d have\nexpected out here, in these infertile lands.”\nBluth grunted.\nShallan sighed, lowering her finger and putting the tiny plant back in the\ncup she’d been using to nurture it. She glanced over her shoulder.\nNo sign of pursuit. She really should just stop worrying.\nShe turned back to her new sketchbook—one of Jasnah’s notebooks that\ndidn’t have many pages filled—then began a quick sketch of the small leaf.\nShe didn’t have very good materials, only a single charcoal pencil, some\npens, and a little ink, but Pattern had been right. She could not stop.\nShe had begun with a replacement sketch of the santhid as she\nremembered it from her dip in the sea. The picture wasn’t equal to the one\nshe’d crafted right after the event, but having it again—in any form—had\nstarted healing the wounds inside.\nShe finished the leaf, then turned the page and began a sketch of Bluth.\nShe didn’t particularly want to restart her collection of people with him, but\nher options were limited. Unfortunately, that hat really did look silly—it\nwas far too small for his head. The image of him huddled forward like a\ncrab, back to the sky and hat on his head… well, at least it would be an\ninteresting composition.\n“Where did you get the hat?” she asked as she sketched.\n“Traded for it,” Bluth mumbled, not looking at her.\n“Did it cost much?”\nHe shrugged. Shallan had lost her own hats in the sinking, but had\npersuaded Tvlakv to give her one of the ones woven by the parshmen. It\nwasn’t particularly attractive, but it kept the sun off her face.\nDespite the bumping wagon, Shallan eventually managed to finish her\nsketch of Bluth. She inspected it, dissatisfied. It was a poor way to start her\ncollection, particularly as she felt she’d caricatured him somewhat. She\npursed her lips. What would Bluth look like if he weren’t always scowling\nat her? If his clothing were neater, if he carried a proper weapon instead of\nthat old cudgel?\nShe flipped the page and started again. A different composition—\nidealized, perhaps, but somehow also right. He could actually look dashing,\nonce you dressed him up properly. A uniform. A spear, planted to his side.\nEyes toward the horizon. By the time she’d finished, she was feeling much\nbetter about the day.

He gave the chull a few\nwhacks to stop it alongside the one pulling Tvlakv’s wagon. Tag rolled up\nhis wagon—he carried the slaves, this time.\n“Knobweed!” Shallan said, lowering her sketch and pointing at a patch\nof thin reeds growing behind a nearby rock.\nBluth groaned. “More of that plant?”\n“Yes. Would you kindly fetch them for me?”\n“Can’t the parshmen do it? I’m supposed to feed the chulls…”\n“Which would you rather make wait, guardsman Bluth? The chulls, or\nthe lighteyed woman?”\nBluth scratched his head underneath the hat, then sullenly climbed down\nfrom the wagon and walked toward the reeds. Nearby, Tvlakv stood on his\nwagon, watching the horizon to the south.\nA thin trail of smoke rose in that direction.\nShallan felt an immediate chill. She scrambled from the wagon and\nhurried to Tvlakv. “Storms!” Shallan said. “Is it the deserters? They are\nfollowing us?”\n“Yes. They have stopped to cook for midday, it seems,” Tvlakv said\nfrom his perch atop his wagon. “They do not care about us seeing their\nfire.” He forced out a laugh. “That is a good sign. They probably know we\nare only three wagons, and are barely worth chasing. So long as we keep\nmoving and don’t stop often, they will give up the chase. Yes. I’m certain.”\nHe hopped down from his wagon, then hurriedly began to water the\nslaves. He didn’t bother to make the parshmen do it—he did the work\nhimself. That, more than anything, testified to his nervousness. He wanted\nto be moving again quickly.\nThat left the parshmen to continue weaving in their cage behind\nTvlakv’s wagon. Anxious, Shallan stood there watching. The deserters had\nspotted the wagons’ trail of broken rockbuds.\nShe found herself sweating, but what could she do? She couldn’t hurry\nthe caravan. She had to simply hope, as Tvlakv said, that they could stay\nahead of pursuit.\nThat didn’t seem likely. The chull wagons couldn’t be faster than\nmarching men.\nDistract yourself, Shallan thought as she started to panic. Find\nsomething to take your mind off the pursuit.\nWhat about Tvlakv’s parshmen? Shallan eyed them. Perhaps a drawing\nof the two of them in their cage?\nNo. She was too nervous for drawing, but perhaps she could find\nsomething out. She walked to the parshmen. Her feet complained, but the\npain was manageable. In fact, in contrast to how she’d covered it up on\nprevious days, now she exaggerated her winces. Better to make Tvlakv\nthink she was less well than she was.\nShe stopped at the cage’s bars. The back was unlocked—parshmen\nnever ran. Buying these two must have been quite an investment for Tvlakv.\nParshmen weren’t cheap, and many monarchs and powerful lighteyes\nhoarded them."

Buying these two must have been quite an investment for Tvlakv.\nParshmen weren’t cheap, and many monarchs and powerful lighteyes\nhoarded them.\nOne of the two glanced at Shallan, then turned back to his work. Her\nwork? It was difficult to tell the males from the females without undressing\nthem. Both of these two had red on white marbled skin. They had squat\nbodies, perhaps five feet tall, and were bald.\nIt was so difficult to see these two humble workers as a threat. “What\nare your names?” Shallan asked.\nOne looked up. The other kept working.\n“Your name,” Shallan prodded.\n“One,” the parshman said. He pointed at his companion. “Two.” He put\nhis head down and kept working.\n“Are you happy with your life?” Shallan asked. “Would you rather be\nfree, given the chance?”\nThe parshman looked up at her and frowned. He scrunched up his brow,\nmouthing a few of the words, then shook his head. He didn’t understand.\n“Freedom?” Shallan prodded.\nHe hunched down to work.\nHe actually looks uncomfortable, Shallan thought. Embarrassed for not\nunderstanding. His posture seemed to say, “Please stop asking me\nquestions.” Shallan tucked her sketchbook under her arm and took a\nMemory of the two of them working there.\nThese are evil monsters, she told herself forcefully, creatures of legend\nwho will soon be bent on destroying everyone and everything around them.\nStanding here, looking in at them, she found it difficult to believe, even\nthough she had accepted the evidence.\nStorms. Jasnah was right. Persuading the lighteyes to rid themselves of\ntheir parshmen was going to be nearly impossible. She would need very,\nvery solid proof. Troubled, she walked back to her seat and climbed up,\nmaking sure to wince. Bluth had left her a bundle of knobweed, and was\nnow caring for the chulls. Tvlakv was digging out some food for a quick\nlunch, which they’d probably eat while moving.\nShe quieted her nerves and forced herself to do some sketches of nearby\nplants. She soon moved on to a sketch of the horizon and the rock\nformations nearby. The air didn’t feel as cold as it had during her first days\nwith the slavers, though her breath still steamed before her in the mornings.\nAs Tvlakv passed by, he gave her an uncomfortable glance. He had\ntreated her differently since their confrontation at the fire last night.\nShallan continued sketching. It was certainly a lot flatter out here than\nback home. And there were far fewer plants, though they were more robust.\nAnd… … And was that another column of smoke up ahead? She stood up\nand raised a hand to shade her eyes. Yes. More smoke. She looked\nsouthward, toward the pursuing mercenaries.\nNearby, Tag stopped, noticing what she had. He hustled over to Tvlakv,\nand the two started arguing softly.\n“Tradesman Tvlakv”—Shallan refused to call him “Trademaster,” as\nwould be his proper title as a full merchant—“I would hear your\ndiscussion.”\n“Of course, Brightness, of course.” He waddled over, wringing his"

So it is not unexpected that we should encounter others…”\n“Those ahead?”\n“Another caravan, if we are lucky.”\nAnd if we’re unlucky… She didn’t need to ask. It would mean more\ndeserters or bandits.\n“We can avoid them,” Tvlakv said. “Only a large group would dare\nmake smoke for midday meals, as it is an invitation—or a warning. The\nsmall caravans, like ourselves, do not risk it.”\n“If it’s a large caravan,” Tag said, rubbing his brow with a thick finger,\n“they’ll have guards. Good protection.” He looked southward.\n“Yes,” Tvlakv said. “But we could also be placing ourselves between\ntwo enemies. Danger on all sides…”\n“Those behind will catch us, Tvlakv,” Shallan said.\n“I—”\n“A man hunting game will return with a mink if there are no telm to be\nfound,” she said. “Those deserters have to kill to survive out here. Didn’t\nyou say there was probably going to be a highstorm tonight?”\n“Yes,” Tvlakv said, reluctant. “Two hours after sunset, if the list I\nbought is correct.”\n“I don’t know how bandits normally weather the storms,” Shallan said,\n“but they’ve obviously committed to chasing us down. I’d bet they plan to\nuse the wagons as shelter after killing us. They’re not going to let us go.”\n“Perhaps,” Tvlakv said. “Yes, perhaps. But Brightness, if we see that\nsecond column of smoke ahead, so might the deserters…”\n“Yeah,” Tag said, nodding, as if he’d only just realized it. “We cut east.\nThe killers might go after the group ahead.”\n“We let them attack someone else instead of us?” Shallan said, folding\nher arms.\n“What else would you expect us to do, Brightness?” Tvlakv said,\nexasperated. “We are small cremlings, you see. Our only choice is to keep\naway from larger creatures and hope for them to hunt one another.”\nShallan narrowed her eyes, inspecting that small column of smoke\nahead. Was it her eyes, or was it growing thicker? She looked backward.\nActually, the columns looked to be about the same size.\nThey won’t hunt prey their own size, Shallan thought. They left the army,\nran away. They’re cowards.\nNearby, she could see Bluth looking backward as well, watching that\nsmoke with an expression she couldn’t read. Disgust? Longing? Fear? No\nspren to give her a clue.\nCowards, she thought again, or just men disillusioned?

Cutting eastward wouldn’t work. The deserters would\ntake the easy kill—slow-moving wagons—instead of the potentially harder\nkill straight ahead.\n“We make for the second column of smoke,” Shallan said, sitting down.\nTvlakv looked at her. “You don’t get to—” He broke off as she met his\neyes.\n“You…” Tvlakv said, licking his lips. “You won’t get… to the Shattered\nPlains as quickly, Brightness, if we get tied up with a larger caravan, you\nsee. It could be bad.”\n“I will deal with that if the problem arises, tradesman Tvlakv.”\n“Those ahead will keep moving,” Tvlakv warned. “We may arrive at\nthat camp and find them gone.”\n“In which case,” Shallan said, “they will either be moving toward the\nShattered Plains or coming this way, along the corridor toward the port\ncities. We will intersect them eventually one way or another.”\nTvlakv sighed, then nodded, calling to Tag to hurry.\nShallan sat down, feeling a thrill. Bluth returned and took his seat, then\nshoved a few wizened roots in her direction. Lunch, apparently. Shortly, the\nwagons began rolling northward, Shallan’s wagon falling into place third in\nline this time.\nShallan settled into her seat for the trip—they were hours away from\nthat second group, even if they did manage to catch up to it. To keep from\nworrying, she finished her sketches of the landscape. She then turned to idle\nsketches, simply letting her pencil go where it willed.\nShe drew skyeels dancing in the air. She drew the docks of Kharbranth.\nShe did a sketch of Yalb, though the face felt off to her, and she didn’t quite\ncapture the mischievous spark in his eyes. Perhaps the errors related to how\nsad she became, thinking of what had probably happened to him.\nShe flipped the page and started a random sketch, whatever came into\nher mind. Her pencil moved into a depiction of an elegant woman in a\nstately gown. Loose but sleek below the waist, tight across the chest and\nstomach. Long, open sleeves, one hiding the safehand, the other cut at the\nelbow exposing the forearm and draping down below.\nA bold, poised woman. In control. Still drawing unconsciously, Shallan\nadded her own face to the elegant woman’s head.\nShe hesitated, pencil hovering above the image. That wasn’t her. Was it?\nCould it be?\nShe stared at that image as the wagon bumped over rocks and plants.\nShe flipped to the next page and started another drawing. A ball gown, a\nwoman at court, surrounded by the elite of Alethkar as she imagined them.\nTall, strong. The woman belonged among them.\nShallan added her face to the figure.\nShe flipped the page and did another one. And then another.\nThe last one was a sketch of her standing at the edge of the Shattered\nPlains as she imagined them. Looking eastward, toward the secrets that\nJasnah had sought."

        "text": "The last one was a sketch of her standing at the edge of the Shattered\nPlains as she imagined them. Looking eastward, toward the secrets that\nJasnah had sought.\nShallan flipped the page and drew again. A picture of Jasnah on the\nship, seated at her desk, papers and books sprawled around her. It wasn’t the\nsetting that mattered, but the face. That worried, terrified face. Exhausted,\npushed to her limits.\nShallan got this one right. The first drawing since the disaster that\ncaptured perfectly what she’d seen. Jasnah’s burden.\n“Stop the wagon,” Shallan said, not looking up.\nBluth glanced at her. She resisted the urge to say it again. He didn’t,\nunfortunately, obey immediately.\n“Why?” he demanded.\nShallan looked up. The smoke column was still distant, but she’d been\nright, it was growing thicker. The group ahead had stopped and built a\nsizable fire for the midday meal. Judging by that smoke, they were a much\nlarger group than the one behind.\n“I’m going to get into the back,” Shallan said. “I need to look something\nup. You can continue when I’m settled, but please stop and call to me once\nwe’re near to the group ahead.”\nHe sighed, but stopped the chull with a few whacks on the shell. Shallan\nclimbed down, then took the knobweed and notebook, moved to the back of\nthe wagon. Once she was in, Bluth started up again immediately, shouting\nback to Tvlakv, who had demanded to know the meaning of the delay.\nWith the walls up her wagon was shaded and private, particularly with it\nbeing last in line so nobody could look in the back door at her.\nUnfortunately, riding in the back wasn’t as comfortable as riding in the\nfront. Those tiny rockbuds caused a surprising amount of jarring and\njolting.\nJasnah’s trunk was tied in place near the front wall. She opened the lid\n—letting the spheres inside provide dusky illumination—then settled back\non her improvised cushion, a pile of the cloths Jasnah had used to wrap her\nbooks. The blanket she used at night—as Tvlakv had been unable to\nproduce one for her—was the velvet lining she had ripped out of the trunk.\nSettling back, she unwrapped her feet to apply the new knobweed. They\nwere scabbed over and much improved from their condition just a day\nbefore. “Pattern?”\nHe vibrated from somewhere nearby. She’d asked him to remain in the\nback so as to not alarm Tvlakv and the guards.\n“My feet are healing,” she said. “Did you do this?”\n“Mmmm… I know almost nothing of why people break. I know less of\nwhy they… unbreak.”\n“Your kind don’t get wounded?” she asked, snapping off a knobweed\nstem and squeezing the drops onto her left foot.\n“We break. We just do it… differently than men do. And we do not\nunbreak without aid. I do not know why you unbreak. Why?”\n“It is a natural function of our bodies,” she said. “Living things repair\nthemselves automatically.” She held one of her spheres close, searching for"

        "text": "unbreak without aid. I do not know why you unbreak. Why?”\n“It is a natural function of our bodies,” she said. “Living things repair\nthemselves automatically.” She held one of her spheres close, searching for\nsigns of little red rotspren. Where she found a few of them along one cut,\nshe was quick to apply sap and chase them off.\n“I would like to know why things work,” Pattern said.\n“So would many of us,” Shallan said, bent over. She grimaced as the\nwagon hit a particularly large rock. “I made myself glow last night, by the\nfire with Tvlakv.”\n“Yes.”\n“Do you know why?”\n“Lies.”\n“My dress changed,” Shallan said. “I swear the scuffs and rips were\ngone last night. They’ve returned now, though.”\n“Mmm. Yes.”\n“I have to be able to control this thing we can do. Jasnah called it\nLightweaving. She implied it was far safer to practice than Soulcasting.”\n“The book?”\nShallan frowned, sitting back against the bars on the side of the wagon.\nBeside her, a long line of scratches on the floor looked like they’d been\nmade by fingernails. As if one of the slaves had tried, in a fit of madness, to\nclaw his way to freedom.\nThe book Jasnah had given her, Words of Radiance, had been swallowed\nby the ocean. It seemed a greater loss than the other one Jasnah had given\nher, the Book of Endless Pages, which had strangely been blank. She didn’t\nunderstand the full significance of that yet.\n“I never got a chance to actually read that book,” Shallan said. “We’ll\nneed to see if we can find another copy once we reach the Shattered Plains.”\nTheir destination being a warcamp, though, she doubted that many books\nwould be for sale.\nShallan held one of her spheres up before herself. It was growing dim,\nand needed to be reinfused. What would happen if the highstorm came, and\nthey hadn’t caught up to the group ahead? Would the deserters push through\nthe storm itself to reach them? And, potentially, the safety of their wagons?\nStorms, what a mess. She needed an edge. “The Knights Radiant\nformed a bond with spren,” Shallan said, more to herself than to Pattern. “It\nwas a symbiotic relationship, like a little cremling who lives in the\nshalebark. The cremling cleans off the lichen, getting food, but also keeping\nthe shalebark clean.”\nPattern buzzed in confusion. “Am I… the shalebark or the cremling?”\n“Either,” Shallan said, turning the diamond sphere in her fingers—the\ntiny gemstone trapped inside glowed with a vigilant light, suspended in\nglass. “The Surges—the forces that run the world—are more pliable to\nspren. Or… well… since spren are pieces of those Surges, maybe it’s that\nthe spren are better at influencing one another. Our bond gives me the\nability to manipulate one of the Surges. In this case, light, the power of\nIllumination.”\n“Lies,” Pattern whispered. “And truths.”\nShallan gripped the sphere in her fist, the light shining through her skin"

        "text": "Illumination.”\n“Lies,” Pattern whispered. “And truths.”\nShallan gripped the sphere in her fist, the light shining through her skin\nmaking her hand glow red. She willed the Light to enter her, but nothing\nhappened. “So, how do I make it work?”\n“Perhaps eat it?” Pattern said, moving over onto the wall beside her\nhead.\n“Eat it?” Shallan asked, skeptical. “I didn’t need to eat it before to get\nthe Stormlight.”\n“Might work, though. Try?”\n“I doubt I could swallow an entire sphere,” Shallan said. “Even if I\nwanted to, which I distinctly do not.”\n“Mmmm,” Pattern said, his vibrations making the wood shake. “This…\nis not one of the things humans like to eat, then?”\n“Storms, no. Haven’t you been paying attention?”\n“I have,” he said with an annoyed zip of a vibration. “But it is difficult\nto tell! You consume some things, and turn them into other things… Very\ncurious things that you hide. They have value? But you leave them. Why?”\n“We are done with that conversation,” Shallan said, opening her fist and\nholding up the sphere again. Though, admittedly, something about what he\nsaid felt right. She hadn’t eaten any spheres before, but she had somehow…\nconsumed the Light. Like drinking it.\nShe’d breathed it in, right? She stared at the sphere for a moment, then\nsucked in a sharp breath.\nIt worked. The Light left the sphere, quick as a heartbeat, a bright line\nstreaming into her chest. From there it spread, filling her. The unusual\nsensation made her feel anxious, alert, ready. Eager to be about…\nsomething. Her muscles tensed.\n“It worked,” she said, though when she spoke, Stormlight—glowing\nfaintly—puffed out in front of her. It rose from her skin, too. She had to\npractice before it all left. Lightweaving… She needed to create something.\nShe decided to go with what she’d done before, improving the look of her\ndress.\nAgain, nothing happened. She didn’t know what to do, what muscles to\nuse, or even if muscles mattered. Frustrated, she sat there trying to find a\nway to make the Stormlight work, feeling inept as it escaped through her\nskin.\nIt took several minutes for it to dissipate completely. “Well, that was\ndistinctly unimpressive,” she said, moving to get more stalks of knobweed.\n“Maybe I should practice Soulcasting instead.”\nPattern buzzed. “Dangerous.”\n“So Jasnah told me,” Shallan said. “But I don’t have her to teach me\nanymore, and so far as I know, she’s the only one who could have done so.\nIt’s either practice on my own or never learn to use the ability.” She\nsqueezed out another few drops of knobweed sap, moved to massage it into\na cut on her foot, then stopped. The wound was noticeably smaller than it\nhad been just moments ago.\n“The Stormlight is healing me,” Shallan said.\n“It makes you unbreak?”\n“Yes. Stormfather! I’m doing things almost by accident.”\n“Can something be ‘almost’ an accident?” Pattern asked, genuinely"

I’m doing things almost by accident.”\n“Can something be ‘almost’ an accident?” Pattern asked, genuinely\ncurious. “This phrase, I do not know what it means.”\n“I… Well, it’s mostly a figure of speech.” Then, before he could ask\nfurther, she continued, “And by that I mean something we say to convey an\nidea or a feeling, but not a literal fact.”\nPattern buzzed.\n“What does that mean?” Shallan asked, massaging the knobweed in\nanyway. “When you buzz like that. What are you feeling?”\n“Hmmm… Excited. Yes. It has been so long since anyone has learned of\nyou and your kind.”\nShallan squeezed some more sap onto her toes. “You came to learn?\nWait… you’re a scholar?”\n“Of course. Hmmm. Why else would I come? I will learn so much\nbefore—”\nHe stopped abruptly.\n“Pattern?” she asked. “Before what?”\n“A figure of speech.” He said it perfectly flatly, absent of tone. He was\ngrowing better and better at speaking like a person, and at times he sounded\njust like one. But now all of the color had gone from his voice.\n“You’re lying,” she accused him, glancing at his pattern on the wall. He\nhad shrunk, growing as small as a fist, half his usual size.\n“Yes,” he said reluctantly.\n“You’re a terrible liar,” Shallan said, surprised at the realization.\n“Yes.”\n“But you love lies!”\n“So fascinating,” he said. “You are all so fascinating.”\n“Tell me what you were going to say,” Shallan ordered. “Before you\nstopped yourself. I’ll know if you lie.”\n“Hmmmm. You sound like her. More and more like her.”\n“Tell me.”\nHe buzzed with an annoyed sound, quick and high pitched. “I will learn\nwhat I can of you before you kill me.”\n“You think… You think I’m going to kill you?”\n“It happened to the others,” Pattern said, his voice softer now. “It will\nhappen to me. It is… a pattern.”\n“This has to do with the Knights Radiant,” Shallan said, raising her\nhands to start braiding her hair. That would be better than leaving it wild—\nthough without a comb and brush, even braiding it was hard. Storms, she\nthought, I need a bath. And soap. And a dozen other things.\n“Yes,” Pattern said. “The knights killed their spren.”\n“How? Why?”\n“Their oaths,” Pattern said. “It is all I know. My kind, those who were\nunbonded, we retreated, and many kept our minds. Even still, it is hard to\nthink apart from my kind, unless…”\n“Unless?”\n“Unless we have a person.”\n“So that’s what you get out of it,” Shallan said, untangling her hair with\nher fingers. “Symbiosis. I get access to Surgebinding, you get thought.”\n“Sapience,” Pattern said. “Thought. Life. These are of humans. We are\nideas. Ideas that wish to live.”\nShallan continued working on her hair. “I’m not going to kill you,” she"

Ideas that wish to live.”\nShallan continued working on her hair. “I’m not going to kill you,” she\nsaid firmly. “I won’t do it.”\n“I don’t suppose the others intended to either,” he said. “But it is no\nmatter.”\n“It is an important matter,” Shallan said. “I won’t do it. I’m not one of\nthe Knights Radiant. Jasnah made that clear. A man who can use a sword\nisn’t necessarily a soldier. Just because I can do what I do doesn’t make me\none of them.”\n“You spoke oaths.”\nShallan froze.\nLife before death… The words drifted toward her from the shadows of\nher past. A past she would not think of.\n“You live lies,” Pattern said. “It gives you strength. But the truth…\nWithout speaking truths you will not be able to grow, Shallan. I know this\nsomehow.”\nShe finished with her hair and moved to rewrap her feet. Pattern had\nmoved to the other side of the rattling wagon chamber, settling onto the\nwall, only faintly visible in the dim light. She had a handful of infused\nspheres left. Not much Stormlight, considering how quickly that other had\nleft her. Should she use what she had to further heal her feet? Could she\neven do that intentionally, or would the ability elude her, as Lightweaving\nhad?\nShe tucked the spheres into her safepouch. She would save them, just in\ncase. For now, these spheres and their Light might be the only weapon\navailable to her.\nBandages redone, she stood up in the rattling wagon and found that her\nfoot pain was nearly gone. She could walk almost normally, though she still\nwouldn’t want to go far without shoes. Pleased, she knocked on the wood\nnearest to Bluth. “Stop the wagon!”\nThis time, she didn’t have to repeat herself. She rounded the wagon and,\ntaking her seat beside Bluth, immediately noticed the smoke column ahead.\nIt had grown darker, larger, roiling violently.\n“That’s no cook fire,” Shallan said.\n“Aye,” Bluth said, expression dark. “Something big is burning.\nProbably wagons.” He glanced at her. “Whoever is up there, it doesn’t look\nlike things went well for them.”\n18. Bruises\nScholarform shown for patience and thought.\nBeware its ambitions innate.\nThough study and diligence bring the reward,\nLoss of innocence may be one’s fate.\nFrom the Listener Song of Listing, 69th\nstanza\n“New guys are coming along, gancho,” Lopen said, taking a bite of the\npaper-wrapped something he was eating. “Wearing their uniforms, talking\nlike real men. Funny. It only took them a few days. Took us weeks.”\n“It took the rest of the men weeks, but not you,” Kaladin said, shading\nhis eyes from the sun and leaning on his spear. He was still on the lighteyes’\npractice grounds, watching over Adolin and Renarin—the latter of whom\nwas receiving his first instructions from Zahel the swordmaster. “You had a\ngood attitude from the first day we found you, Lopen.”\n“Well, life was pretty good, you know?”"

You’d just been assigned to carry siege bridges until you\ndied on the plateaus.”\n“Eh,” Lopen said, taking a bite of his food. It looked like a thick piece\nof flatbread wrapped around something goopy. He licked his lips, then\nhanded it to Kaladin to free his single hand so he could dig in his pocket for\na moment. “You have bad days. You have good days. Evens out eventually.”\n“You’re a strange man, Lopen,” Kaladin said, inspecting the “food”\nLopen had been eating. “What is this?”\n“Chouta.”\n“Chowder?”\n“Cha-ou-ta. Herdazian food, gon. Good stuff. You can have a bite, if\nyou want.”\nIt seemed to be chunks of undefinable meat slathered in some dark\nliquid, all wrapped in overly thick bread. “Disgusting,” Kaladin said,\nhanding it back as Lopen gave him the thing he’d dug out of his pocket, a\nshell with glyphs written on both sides.\n“Your loss,” Lopen said, taking another bite.\n“You shouldn’t be walking around eating like that,” Kaladin noted. “It’s\nrude.”\n“Nah, it’s convenient. See, it’s wrapped up good. You can walk about,\nget stuff done, eat at the same time…”\n“Slovenly,” Kaladin said, inspecting the shell. It listed Sigzil’s tallies of\nhow many troops they had, how much food Rock thought they’d need, and\nTeft’s assessments of how many of the former bridgemen were fit for\ntraining.\nThat last number was pretty high. If bridgemen lived, they got strong\ncarrying bridges. As Kaladin had proven firsthand, that translated to their\nmaking fine soldiers, assuming they could be motivated.\nOn the reverse side of the shell, Sigzil had outlined a path for Kaladin to\ntake on patrol outside the warcamps. He’d soon have enough of the\ngreenvines ready to begin patrolling the region outside of the warcamps, as\nhe’d told Dalinar he would do. Teft thought it would be good for Kaladin to\ngo himself, as it would let the new men spend time with Kaladin.\n“Highstorm tonight,” Lopen noted. “Sig says it will come two hours\nafter sunset. He thought you’d want to make preparations.”\nKaladin nodded. Another chance for those mysterious numbers to\nappear—both times before, they’d come during storms. He’d make extra\ncertain Dalinar and his family were being watched.\n“Thanks for the report,” Kaladin said, tucking the shell into his pocket.\n“Send back and tell Sigzil his proposed route takes me too far from the\nwarcamps. Have him draw up another one. Also, tell Teft I need a few more\nmen to come here today and relieve Moash and Drehy. They’ve both been\npulling too many hours lately. I’ll guard Dalinar tonight myself—suggest to\nthe highprince it would be convenient if his entire family would be together\nfor the highstorm.”"

I’ll guard Dalinar tonight myself—suggest to\nthe highprince it would be convenient if his entire family would be together\nfor the highstorm.”\n“If the winds will, gon,” Lopen said, finishing his last bite of chouta. He\nwhistled then, looking in at the practice grounds. “That is something, isn’t\nit?”\nKaladin followed Lopen’s gaze. Adolin, having left his brother with\nZahel, was now executing a training sequence with his Shardblade.\nGracefully, he spun and twisted on the sands, sweeping his sword in broad,\nflowing patterns.\nOn a practiced Shardbearer, Plate never looked clumsy. Imposing,\nresplendent, it fit to the form of the wearer. Adolin’s reflected sunlight like a\nmirror as he made sweeps of the sword, moving from one posture to the\nnext. Kaladin knew it was just a warm-up sequence, more impressive than\nfunctional. You’d never do something like this on the battlefield, though\nmany of the individual postures and cuts represented practical movements.\nEven knowing that, Kaladin had to shake off a feeling of awe.\nShardbearers in Plate looked inhuman when they fought, more like Heralds\nthan men.\nHe caught Syl sitting on the edge of the roof overhang near Adolin,\nwatching the young man. She was too distant for Kaladin to make out her\nexpression.\nAdolin finished his warm-up in a move where he fell to one knee and\nslammed his Shardblade into the ground. It sank up to mid-blade, then\nvanished when he released it.\n“I’ve seen him summon that weapon before,” Kaladin said.\n“Yeah, gancho, on the battlefield, when we saved his sorry ass from\nSadeas.”\n“No, before that,” Kaladin said, remembering an incident with a whore\nin Sadeas’s camp. “He saved someone who was being bullied.”\n“Huh,” Lopen said. “He can’t be too bad then, you know?”\n“I suppose. Anyway, off with you. Make sure to send that replacement\nteam.”\nLopen saluted, collecting Shen, who had been poking at practice swords\nalong the side of the courtyard. Together, they jogged off on the errand.\nKaladin did his rounds, checking on Moash and the others before\nwalking over to where Renarin sat—still armored—on the ground before\nhis new master.\nZahel, the ardent with the ancient eyes, sat in a solemn posture that\nbelied his ragged beard. “You will need to relearn how to fight, wearing that\nPlate. It changes the way a man steps, grips, moves.”\n“I…” Renarin looked down. It was very odd to see a man wearing\nspectacles in the magnificent armor. “I will not need to relearn how to fight,\nmaster. I never learned in the first place.”\nZahel grunted. “That’s good. It means I don’t have to break down any\nold, bad habits.”\n“Yes, master.”\n“We’ll start you off easily, then,” Zahel said. “There are some steps at\nthe corner over there. Climb up onto the roof of the dueling grounds. Then\njump off.”\nRenarin looked up sharply. “… Jump?”\n“I’m old, son,” Zahel said. “Repeating myself makes me eat the wrong"

Kaladin shrugged.\n“Eat… what… ?” Renarin asked.\n“It means I get angry,” Zahel snapped. “You people don’t have proper\nidioms for anything. Go!”\nRenarin sprang to his feet, kicking up sand, and hustled away.\n“Your helmet, son!” Zahel called.\nRenarin stopped, then scrambled back and snatched his helmet off the\nground, nearly slipping onto his face as he did so. He spun, off balance, and\nran awkwardly toward the stairs. He nearly plowed into a pillar on the way.\nKaladin snorted softly.\n“Oh,” Zahel said, “and you assume you’d do better your first time\nwearing Shardplate, bodyguard?”\n“I doubt I’d forget my helmet,” Kaladin said, shouldering his spear and\nstretching. “If Dalinar Kholin intends to force the other highprinces into\nline, I think he’s going to need better Shardbearers than this. He should\nhave picked someone else for that Plate.”\n“Like you?”\n“Storms no,” Kaladin said, perhaps too vehemently. “I’m a soldier,\nZahel. I want nothing to do with Shards. The boy is likable enough, but I\nwouldn’t trust men to his command—let alone armor that could keep a\nmuch better soldier alive on the field—and that’s it.”\n“He’ll surprise you,” Zahel replied. “I gave him the whole ‘I’m your\nmaster and you do what I say’ talk, and he actually listened.”\n“Every soldier hears that on their first day,” Kaladin said. “Sometimes\nthey listen. That the boy did is hardly noteworthy.”\n“If you knew how many spoiled ten-year-old lighteyed brats came\nthrough here,” Zahel said, “you’d think it worth noting. I thought a\nnineteen-year-old like him would be insufferable. And don’t call him a boy,\nboy. He’s probably close to your own age, and is the son of the most\npowerful human on this—”\nHe cut off as scraping from atop the building announced Renarin Kholin\ncharging and throwing himself off into the air, boots grinding against the\nstone coping of the roof. He sailed a good ten or twelve feet out over the\ncourtyard—practiced Shardbearers could do far better—before floundering\nlike a dying skyeel and crashing down into the sand.\nZahel looked toward Kaladin, raising an eyebrow.\n“What?” Kaladin asked.\n“Enthusiasm, obedience, no fear of looking foolish,” Zahel said. “I can\nteach him how to fight, but those qualities are innate. This lad is going to do\njust fine.”\n“Assuming he doesn’t fall on anyone,” Kaladin said.\nRenarin climbed to his feet. He looked down, as if surprised that he\nhadn’t broken anything.\n“Go up and do it again!” Zahel called to Renarin. “This time, fall\nheadfirst!”\nRenarin nodded, then turned and trotted off toward the stairwell."

The man was carrying a Shardblade with metal guards over\nthe sharp edges, one of the ones the king provided for training use.\nZahel took the Shardblade from the ardent, holding it up.\nKaladin nodded his chin at it. “What’s that on the Blade?”\n“Nobody’s sure,” Zahel said, swiping with the Blade. “Fit it to the edges\nof a Blade, and it will adapt to the shape of the weapon and make it safely\nblunt. Off the weapons, they break surprisingly easily. Useless in a fight on\ntheir own. Perfect for training, though.”\nKaladin grunted. Something created long ago, for use in training? Zahel\ninspected the Shardblade for a moment, then pointed it directly toward\nKaladin.\nEven with it blunted—even knowing the man wasn’t going to really\nattack him—Kaladin felt an immediate moment of panic. A Shardblade.\nThis one had a slender, sleek form with a large crossguard. The flat sides of\nthe blade were etched with the ten fundamental glyphs. It was a handspan\nwide and easily six feet long, yet Zahel held it with one hand and didn’t\nseem off balance.\n“Niter,” Zahel said.\n“What?” Kaladin asked, frowning.\n“He was head of the Cobalt Guard before you,” Zahel said. “He was a\ngood man, and a friend. He died keeping the men of the Kholin house alive.\nNow you’ve got the same Damnation job, and you’re going to have a tough\ntime doing it half as well as he did.”\n“I don’t see what that has to do with you waving a Shardblade at me.”\n“Anyone who sends assassins after Dalinar or his sons is going to be\npowerful,” Zahel said. “They’ll have access to Shardbearers. That’s what\nyou’re up against, son. You’re going to need far more training than a\nbattlefield gives a spearman. Have you ever fought a man holding one of\nthese?”\n“Once or twice,” Kaladin said, relaxing against the nearby pillar.\n“Don’t lie to me.”\n“I’m not lying,” Kaladin said, meeting Zahel’s eyes. “Ask Adolin what I"

Behind him, Renarin dove face-first off the\nroof and crashed into the ground. He groaned inside his helm, rolling over.\nHis helm leaked Light but he seemed otherwise unharmed.\n“Well done, Prince Renarin,” Zahel called without looking. “Now do a\nfew more jumps and see if you can land on your feet.”\nRenarin rose and clinked off.\n“All right then,” Zahel said, sweeping the Shardblade in the air. “Let’s\nsee what you can do, kid. Convince me to leave you alone.”\nKaladin didn’t respond other than to heft his spear and settle into a\ndefensive posture, one foot behind, one out front. He held his weapon with\nthe butt forward instead of the point. Nearby, Adolin sparred with another\none of the masters, who had the second King’s Blade and a suit of Plate.\nHow would this work? If Zahel scored a hit on Kaladin’s spear, would\nthey pretend it had cut through?\nThe ardent approached in a rush, raising the Blade in a two-handed grip.\nThe familiar calmness and focus of battle enveloped Kaladin. He did not\ndraw in Stormlight. He needed to be certain not to come to rely on it too\nmuch.\nWatch that Shardblade, Kaladin thought, stepping forward, trying to get\ninside the weapon’s reach. In fighting a Shardbearer, everything became\nabout that Blade. The Blade that nothing could stop, the Blade that didn’t\njust kill the body—but severed the soul itself. The Blade—\nZahel dropped the Blade.\nIt hit the ground as Zahel got inside Kaladin’s reach. Kaladin had been\ntoo focused on the weapon, and though he tried to get his spear in position\nto strike, Zahel twisted and buried his fist into Kaladin’s stomach. The next\npunch—to the face—slammed Kaladin to the floor of the practice grounds.\nKaladin immediately rolled, ignoring the painspren wiggling in the\nsand. He found his feet as his vision swam. He grinned. “Nice move, that.”\nZahel was already turning back to Kaladin, Blade recovered. Kaladin\nscuttled backward on the sand, spear still forward, staying away. Zahel\nknew his way around a Blade. He didn’t fight like Adolin; fewer sweeping\nblows, more overhand chops. Quick and furious. He backed Kaladin around\nthe side of the practice ground.\nHe’ll get tired keeping this up, Kaladin’s instincts said. Keep him\nmoving.\nAfter an almost complete circuit of the grounds, Zahel slowed his\noffense and instead rounded on Kaladin, watching for an opening. “You’d\nbe in trouble if I had Plate,” Zahel said. “I’d be faster, wouldn’t tire.”\n“You don’t have Plate.”\n“And if someone comes for the king wearing it?”\n“I’ll use a different tactic.”\nZahel grunted as Renarin crashed to the ground nearby. The prince\nalmost kept his footing, but stumbled and fell to the side, skidding in the\nsand."

The prince\nalmost kept his footing, but stumbled and fell to the side, skidding in the\nsand.\n“Well, if this were a real assassination attempt,” Zahel said, “I’d be\nusing different tactics too.”\nHe dashed toward Renarin.\nKaladin cursed, taking off after Zahel.\nImmediately, the man reversed, skidding to a stop in the sand and\nspinning to swing at Kaladin with a powerful two-handed blow. The strike\nconnected with Kaladin’s spear, sending a sharp crack echoing across the\npractice grounds. If the Blade hadn’t been guarded, it would have split the\nspear in two and perhaps grazed Kaladin’s chest.\nA watching ardent tossed Kaladin half a spear. They’d been waiting for\nhis spear to be “cut,” and wanted to replicate a real fight as much as\npossible. Nearby, Moash had arrived, looking concerned, but several\nardents intercepted him and explained.\nKaladin looked back to Zahel.\n“In a real fight,” the man said, “I might have chased down the prince by\nnow.”\n“In a real fight,” Kaladin said, “I might have stabbed you with half a\nspear when you thought me disarmed.”\n“I wouldn’t have made that mistake.”\n“Then we’ll have to assume I wouldn’t have made the mistake of letting\nyou get to Renarin.”\nZahel grinned. It looked a dangerous expression on him. He stepped\nforward, and Kaladin understood. There would be no backing away and\nleading him off this time. Kaladin wouldn’t have that option if he were\nprotecting a member of Dalinar’s family. Instead, he had to try his best to\npretend to kill this man.\nThat meant an attack.\nA prolonged, close-quarters fight would favor Zahel, as Kaladin\ncouldn’t parry a Shardblade. Kaladin’s best bet was to strike fast and hope\nto score an early hit. Kaladin barreled forward, then threw himself to his\nknees, skidding on the sands underneath Zahel’s strike. That would get him\nclose, and—\nZahel kicked Kaladin in the face.\nVision swimming, Kaladin rammed his fake spear into Zahel’s leg. The\nman’s Shardblade came down a second later, stopping where Kaladin’s\nshoulder met his neck.\n“You’re dead, son,” Zahel said.\n“You’ve got a spear through the leg,” Kaladin said, puffing. “You aren’t\nchasing down Renarin like that. I win.”\n“You’re still dead,” Zahel said with a grunt.\n“My job is to stop you from killing Renarin. With what I just did, he\nescapes. Doesn’t matter if the bodyguard is dead.”\n“And what if the assassin had a friend?” another voice asked from\nbehind.\nKaladin twisted to see Adolin, in full Plate and standing with his\nShardblade point stuck into the ground before him. He’d removed his helm,\nand held it in one hand, the other hand resting on the Blade’s crossguard.\n“If there were two of them, bridgeboy?” Adolin asked with a smirk.\n“Could you fight two Shardbearers at once? If I wanted to kill Father or the\nking, I’d never send just one.”"

Arrogant bastard.\n“All right,” Zahel said. “I’m sure he sees the point, Adolin. No need—”\nKaladin charged the princeling, and he thought he heard Adolin\nchuckling as he put on his helm.\nSomething boiled inside of Kaladin.\nThe nameless Shardbearer who had killed so many of his friends.\nSadeas, sitting regally in red armor.\nAmaram, hands on a sword stained with blood.\nKaladin screamed as Adolin’s unguarded Shardblade came for him in\none of the careful, sweeping strokes from Adolin’s practice session. Kaladin\npulled himself up short, raising his half-spear and letting the Blade pass\nright before him. Then he slapped the back edge of the Shardblade with his\nspear, knocking Adolin’s grip to the side and fouling up the follow-through.\nKaladin barreled forward and threw his shoulder against the prince. It\nwas like slamming into a wall. Kaladin’s shoulder flared with pain, but the\nmomentum—along with the surprise of his cudgel blow—knocked Adolin\noff balance. Kaladin forced both of them backward, the Shardbearer\ntoppling to the ground with a crash and a surprised grunt.\nRenarin made a twin crash, falling to the ground nearby. Kaladin raised\nhis half-spear like a dagger to plunge it toward Adolin’s faceplate.\nUnfortunately, Adolin had dismissed his Blade as they fell. The princeling\ngot a gauntleted hand up underneath Kaladin.\nKaladin slammed his weapon downward.\nAdolin heaved upward with one hand.\nKaladin’s blow didn’t connect; instead he found himself airborne,\nthrown with all the Plate-augmented strength of a Shardbearer. He\nfloundered in the air before slamming down eight feet away, the sand\ngrinding into his side, the shoulder he’d hit against Adolin flaring in pain\nagain. Kaladin gasped.\n“Idiot!” Zahel yelled.\nKaladin groaned, rolling over. His vision swam.\n“You could have killed the boy!” He was talking to Adolin somewhere\nfar away.\n“He attacked me!” Adolin’s voice was muffled by the helm.\n“You challenged him, fool child.” Zahel’s voice was closer.\n“Then he asked for it,” Adolin said.\nPain. Someone at Kaladin’s side. Zahel?\n“You’re wearing Plate, Adolin.” Yes, that was Zahel kneeling above\nKaladin, whose vision refused to focus. “You don’t throw an unarmored\nsparring partner like he’s a bundle of sticks. Your father taught you better\nthan that!”\nKaladin sucked in sharply and forced his eyes open. Stormlight from the\npouch at his belt filled him. Not too much. Don’t let them see.

Zahel cried out in surprise as Kaladin pitched himself up\nto his feet and dashed back toward Adolin.\nThe prince stumbled away, hand out to his side, obviously summoning\nhis Blade. Kaladin kicked his fallen half-spear up in a spray of sand, then\ngrabbed it in midair as he got near.\nIn that moment, the strength drained from him. The tempest inside of\nhim fled without warning, and he stumbled, gasping at the returning pain of\nhis shoulder.\nAdolin caught him by the arm with a gauntleted fist. The prince’s\nShardblade formed in his other hand, but in that moment, a second Blade\nstopped at Kaladin’s neck.\n“You’re dead,” Zahel said from behind, holding the Blade against\nKaladin’s skin. “Again.”\nKaladin sank down in the middle of the practice grounds, dropping his\nhalf-spear. He felt completely drained. What had happened?\n“Go give your brother some help with his jumping,” Zahel ordered\nAdolin. Why did he get to order around princes?\nAdolin left and Zahel knelt beside Kaladin. “You don’t flinch when\nsomeone swings a Blade at you. You actually have fought Shardbearers\nbefore, haven’t you?”\n“Yeah.”\n“You’re lucky to be alive, then,” Zahel said, probing at Kaladin’s\nshoulder. “You’ve got tenacity. A stupid amount of it. You have good form,\nand you think well in a fight. But you hardly know what you’re doing\nagainst Shardbearers.”\n“I…” What should he say? Zahel was right. It was arrogant to say\notherwise. Two fights—three, if he counted today—did not make one an\nexpert. He winced as Zahel prodded a sore tendon. More painspren on the\nground. He was giving them a workout today.\n“Nothing broken here,” Zahel said with a grunt. “How are your ribs?”\n“They’re fine,” Kaladin said, lying back in the sand, staring up at the\nsky.\n“Well, I won’t force you to learn,” Zahel said, standing up. “I don’t\nthink I could force you, actually.”\nKaladin squeezed his eyes shut. He felt humiliated, but why should he?\nHe’d lost sparring matches before. It happened all the time.\n“You remind me a lot of him,” Zahel said. “Adolin wouldn’t let me\nteach him either. Not at first.”\nKaladin opened his eyes. “I’m nothing like him.”\nZahel barked a laugh at that, then stood and walked away, chuckling, as\nif he’d heard the finest joke in all the world. Kaladin continued to lie on the\nsand, staring upward at the deep blue sky, listening to the sounds of men\nsparring. Eventually, Syl flitted over and landed on his chest.\n“What happened?” Kaladin asked. “The Stormlight drained from me. I\nfelt it go.”\n“Who were you protecting?” Syl asked.\n“I… I was practicing how to fight, like when I practiced with Skar and\nRock down in the chasms.”\n“Is that really what you were doing?” Syl asked."

He lay there, staring at the sky, until he finally caught\nhis breath and forced himself to his feet with a groan. He dusted himself off,\nthen went to check on Moash and the other guards. As he went, he drew in a\nlittle Stormlight, and it worked, slowly healing his shoulder and soothing\naway his bruises.\nThe physical ones, at least.\n19. Safe Things\nFIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO\nThe silk of Shallan’s new dress was softer than any she had owned\nbefore. It touched her skin like a comforting breeze. The left cuff clipped\nclosed over the hand; she was old enough now to cover her safehand. She\nhad once dreamed of wearing a woman’s dress. Her mother and she…\nHer mother…\nShallan’s mind went still. Like a candle suddenly snuffed, she stopped\nthinking. She leaned back in her chair, legs tucked up underneath her, hands\nin her lap. The dreary stone dining chamber bustled with activity as Davar\nManor prepared for guests. Shallan did not know which guests, only that\nher father wanted the place immaculate.\nNot that she could do anything to help.\nTwo maids bustled past. “She saw,” one whispered softly to the other, a\nnew woman. “Poor thing was in the room when it happened. Hasn’t spoken\na word in five months. The master killed his own wife and her lover, but\ndon’t let it…”\nThey continued talking, but Shallan didn’t hear.\nShe kept her hands in her lap. Her dress’s vibrant blue was the only real\ncolor in the room. She sat on the dais, beside the high table. A half-dozen\nmaids in brown, wearing gloves on their safehands, scrubbed the floor and\npolished the furniture. Parshmen carted in a few more tables. A maid threw\nopen the windows, letting in damp fresh air from the recent highstorm.\nShallan caught mention of her name again. The maids apparently\nthought that because she didn’t speak, she didn’t hear either. At times, she\nwondered if she was invisible. Perhaps she wasn’t real. That would be\nnice…\nThe door to the hall slammed open, and Nan Helaran entered. Tall,\nmuscular, square-chinned. Her oldest brother was a man. The rest of\nthem… they were children. Even Tet Balat, who had reached the age of\nadulthood. Helaran scanned the chamber, perhaps looking for their father.\nThen he approached Shallan, a small bundle under his arm. The maids made\nway with alacrity.\n“Hello, Shallan,” Helaran said, squatting down beside her chair. “Here\nto supervise?”\nIt was a place to be. Father did not like her being where she could not be\nwatched. He worried.\n“I brought you something,” Helaran said, unwrapping his bundle. “I\nordered it for you in Northgrip, and the merchant only just passed by.” He\ntook out a leather satchel.\nShallan took it hesitantly.

Helaran’s grin was so wide, it practically\nglowed. It was hard to frown in a room where he was smiling. When he was\naround, she could almost pretend… Almost pretend…\nHer mind went blank.\n“Shallan?” he asked, nudging her.\nShe undid the satchel. Inside was a sheaf of drawing paper, the thick\nkind—the expensive kind—and a set of charcoal pencils. She raised her\ncovered safehand to her lips.\n“I’ve missed your drawings,” Helaran said. “I think you could be very\ngood, Shallan. You should practice more.”\nShe ran the fingers of her right hand across the paper, then picked up a\npencil. She started to sketch. It had been too long.\n“I need you to come back, Shallan,” Helaran said softly.\nShe hunched over, pencil scratching on paper.\n“Shallan?”\nNo words. Just drawing.\n“I’m going to be away a lot in the next few years,” Helaran said. “I need\nyou to watch the others for me. I’m worried about Balat. I gave him a new\naxehound pup, and he… wasn’t kind to it. You need to be strong, Shallan.\nFor them.”\nThe maids had grown quiet since Helaran’s arrival. Lethargic vines\ncurled down outside the window nearby. Shallan’s pencil continued to\nmove. As if she weren’t doing the drawing; as if it were coming up out of\nthe page, the charcoal seeping out of the texture. Like blood.\nHelaran sighed, standing. Then he saw what she was drawing. Bodies,\nfacedown, on the floor with—\nHe grabbed the paper and crumpled it. Shallan started, pulling back,\nfingers shaking as she clutched the pencil.\n“Draw plants,” Helaran said, “and animals. Safe things, Shallan. Don’t\ndwell on what happened.”\nTears trickled down her cheeks.\n“We can’t have vengeance yet,” Helaran said softly. “Balat can’t lead\nthe house, and I must be away. Soon, though.”\nThe door slammed open. Father was a big man, bearded in careless\ndefiance of fashion. His Veden clothing eschewed the modern designs.\nInstead, Father wore a skirtlike garment of silk called an ulatu and a tight\nshirt with a robe over the top. No mink pelts, as his grandfathers might have\nworn, but otherwise very, very traditional.\nHe towered taller than Helaran, taller than anyone else on the estate.\nMore parshmen entered after him, carrying bundles of food for the kitchens.\nAll three had marbled skin, two red on black and one red on white. Father\nliked parshmen. They did not talk back.\n“I got word that you told the stable to prepare one of my carriages,\nHelaran!” Father bellowed. “I’ll not have you gallivanting off again!”\n“There are more important things in this world,” Helaran said. “More\nimportant even than you and your crimes.”\n“Do not speak that way to me,” Father said, stalking forward, finger"

He then\ncontinued forward. “How dare you!

A Blade some six feet long, curved and thick, with the side\nthat wasn’t sharp rising into a shape like burning flames or perhaps ripples\nof water. It had a gemstone set at the pommel, and as light reflected off the\nmetal, the ridges seemed to move.\nHelaran was a Shardbearer. Stormfather! How? When?\nFather cut off, pulling up short. Helaran hopped down from the low\ndais, then leveled the Shardblade at his father. The point touched Father’s\nchest.\nFather raised his hands to the sides, palms forward.\n“You are a vile corruption upon this house,” Helaran said. “I should\nshove this through your chest. To do so would be a mercy.”\n“Helaran…” The passion seemed to have bled from Father, like the\ncolor from his face, which had gone stark white. “You don’t know what you\nthink you know. Your mother—”\n“I will not listen to your lies,” Helaran said, rotating his wrist, twisting\nthe sword in his hand, point still against Father’s chest. “So easy.”\n“No,” Shallan whispered.\nHelaran cocked his head, then turned, not moving the sword.\n“No,” Shallan said, “please.”\n“You speak now?” Helaran said. “To defend him?” He laughed. A wild\nbark of a noise. He whipped the sword away from Father’s chest.\nFather sat down in a dining chair, face still pale. “How? A Shardblade.\nWhere?” He glanced suddenly upward. “But no. It’s different. Your new\nfriends? They trust you with this wealth?”\n“We have an important work to do,” Helaran said, turning and striding\nto Shallan. He laid a hand fondly on her shoulder. He continued more softly.\n“I will tell you of it someday, Sister. It is good to hear your voice again\nbefore I leave.”\n“Don’t go,” she whispered. The words felt like gauze in her mouth. It\nhad been months since she’d last spoken.\n“I must. Please do some drawings for me while I’m gone. Of fanciful\nthings. Of brighter days. Can you do that?”\nShe nodded.\n“Farewell, Father,” Helaran said, turning and striding from the room.\n“Try not to ruin too much while I’m gone. I will come back periodically to\ncheck.” His voice echoed in the hallway outside as he left.\nBrightlord Davar stood, roaring.

He kicked over a small\ndining table, then took the chairs one at a time and smashed them into the\nfloor with repeated, brutal blows.\nBreathing deeply, he turned his eyes on her.\nShallan whimpered at the rage, the lack of humanity, in his eyes. As\nthey focused on her, the life returned to them. Father dropped a broken chair\nand turned his back toward her, as if ashamed, before fleeing the room.\n20.

Though the column had dwindled, she could now make out\nthat it had three different sources, rising into the air and twisting into one.\nShe climbed to her feet on the rocking wagon as they rolled up one last\nhill, then stopped on the side, mere feet away from letting her see what was\nout there. Of course; cresting the hill would be a very bad idea if bandits\nwaited below.\nBluth climbed down from his wagon and jogged forward. He wasn’t\nterribly nimble, but he was the best scout they had. He crouched and\nremoved his too-fine hat, then made his way up the hillside to peek over. A\nmoment later, he stood up straight, no longer attempting stealth.\nShallan hopped down from her seat and hurried over, skirts catching on\nthe twisted branches of crustspines here and there. She reached the top of\nthe hill just before Tvlakv did.\nThree caravan wagons smoldered quietly below, and the signs of a\nbattle littered the ground. Fallen arrows, a group of corpses in a pile.\nShallan’s heart leaped as she saw the living among the dead. A scattering of\ntired figures combed through the rubble or moved bodies. They weren’t\ndressed like bandits, but like honest caravan workers. Five more wagons\nwere clustered on the far side of the camp. Some were scorched, but they all\nlooked functional and still laden with goods.\nArmed men and women tended their wounds. Guards. A group of\nfrightened parshmen cared for the chulls. These people had been attacked,\nbut they had survived. “Kelek’s breath…” Tvlakv said. He turned and\nshooed Bluth and Shallan backward. “Back, before they see.”\n“What?” Bluth said, though he obeyed. “But it’s another caravan, as\nwe’d hoped.”\n“Yes, and they needn’t know we are here.

They flew no banner, and did not march in formation or wear\none uniform, but they looked well equipped.\n“We need to go down and ask the other caravan for help,” Shallan said.\n“No!” Tvlakv said, snatching the spyglass back. “We need to flee!

She wore a tan glove\nover her safehand, and spoke Alethi without an accent.\n“I…” Tvlakv said. “I am just a humble merchant, and—”\n“The ones chasing us are certainly bandits,” Shallan cut in. “They have\nchased us all day.”\nThe woman cursed, raising a spyglass of her own. “Good equipment,”\nshe mumbled. “Deserters, I’d guess. As if this weren’t bad enough. Yix!”\nA second figure stood up nearby, wearing tan clothing the color of\nstone. Shallan jumped. How had she missed spotting him? He was so close!\nHe had a sword at his waist. A lighteyes? No, a foreigner, judging by that\ngolden hair. She never was sure what eye color meant for their social\nstanding. There weren’t people with light eyes in the Makabaki region,\nthough they had kings, and practically everyone in Iri had light yellow eyes.\nHe jogged over, hand on his weapon, watching Bluth and Tag with overt\nhostility. The woman said something to him in a tongue Shallan didn’t\nknow, and he nodded, then jogged off toward the caravan below. The\nwoman followed.\n“Wait,” Shallan called to her.\n“I don’t have time to talk,” the woman snapped. “We’ve got two bandit\ngroups to fight.”\n“Two?” Shallan said. “You didn’t defeat the one that attacked you\nearlier?”\n“We fought them off, but they’ll be back soon.” The woman hesitated"

They were using\nflaming brands to scare us. They pulled back to let us fight the fires, as they\ndidn’t want to lose any more goods.”\nTwo forces, then. Bandits ahead and behind. Shallan found herself\nsweating in the cold air as the sun finally vanished beneath the western\nhorizon.\nThe woman was looking northward, toward where her group of bandits\nmust have retreated. “Yeah, they’ll be back,” the woman said. “They’ll want\nto be done with us before the storm comes tonight.”\n“I offer you my protection,” Shallan found herself saying.\n“Your protection?” the woman said, turning back to Shallan, sounding\nbaffled.\n“You may accept me and mine into your camp,” Shallan said. “I will see\nto your safety tonight. I will need your service after that to convey me to the\nShattered Plains.”\nThe woman laughed. “You are gutsy, whoever you are. You can join our\ncamp, but you’ll die there with the rest of us!”\nCries rose from the caravan. A second later, a flight of arrows fell\nthrough the night from that direction, pelting wagons and caravan workers.\nScreams.\nBandits followed, emerging from the blackness. They weren’t nearly as\nwell equipped as the deserters, but they didn’t need to be. The caravan had\nfewer than a dozen guards left. The woman cursed and started running\ndown the hillside.\nShallan shivered, eyes wide at the sudden slaughter below. Then she\nturned and walked to Tvlakv’s wagons. This sudden chill was familiar to\nher. The coldness of clarity. She knew what she had to do. She didn’t know\nif it would work, but she saw the solution—like lines in a drawing, coming\ntogether to transform random scribbles into a full picture.\n“Tvlakv,” she said, “take Tag below and try to help those people fight.”\n“What!” he said. “No. No, I will not throw my life away for your\nfoolishness.”\nShe met his eyes in the near darkness, and he stopped. She knew that\nshe was glowing softly; she could feel the storm within. “Do it.” She left\nhim and walked to her wagon. “Bluth, turn this wagon around.”\nHe stood with a sphere beside the wagon, looking down at something in\nhis hand. A sheet of paper? Surely Bluth of all people didn’t know glyphs.\n“Bluth!” Shallan snapped, climbing into the wagon. “We need to be\nmoving. Now!”\nHe shook himself, then tucked the paper away and scrambled into the\nseat beside her. He whipped at the chull, turning it. “What are we doing?”\nhe asked.\n“Heading south.”\n“Into the bandits?”\n“Yes.”\nFor once, he did as she told him without complaint, whipping the chull\nfaster—as if he were eager to just get this all over with. The wagon rattled\nand shook as they went down one hillside, then climbed another."

The wagon rattled\nand shook as they went down one hillside, then climbed another.\nThey reached the top and looked down at the force climbing toward\nthem. The men carried torches and sphere lanterns, so she could see their\nfaces. Dark expressions on grim men with weapons drawn. Their\nbreastplates or leather jerkins might once have held symbols of allegiance,\nbut she could see where those had been cut or scratched away.\nThe deserters looked at her with obvious shock. They had not expected\ntheir prey to come to them. Her arrival stunned them for a moment. An\nimportant moment.\nThere will be an officer, Shallan thought, standing up on her seat. They\nare soldiers, or once were. They’ll have a command structure.\nShe took a deep breath. Bluth raised his sphere, looking at her, and\ngrunted as if surprised.\n“Bless the Stormfather that you’re here!” Shallan cried to the men. “I\nneed your help desperately.”\nThe group of deserters just stared at her.\n“Bandits,” Shallan said. “They’re attacking our friends in the caravan\njust two hills over. It’s a slaughter! I said I’d seen soldiers back here,\nmoving toward the Shattered Plains. Nobody believed me. Please. You must\nhelp.”\nAgain, they just stared at her. A little like the mink wandering into the\nwhitespine’s den and asking when dinner is… she thought. Finally, the men\nshuffled uneasily and turned toward a man near the center. Tall, bearded, he\nhad arms that looked too long for his body.\n“Bandits, you say,” the man replied, voice empty of emotion.\nShallan leaped down from the wagon and walked toward the man,\nleaving Bluth sitting as a silent lump. Deserters stepped away from her,\nwearing ripped and dirty clothing, with grizzled, unkempt hair and faces\nthat hadn’t seen a razor—or a washcloth—in ages. And yet, by torchlight,\ntheir weapons gleamed without a spot of rust and their breastplates were\npolished to the point where they reflected her features.\nThe woman she glimpsed in one breastplate looked too tall, too stately,\nto be Shallan herself. Instead of tangled hair, she had flowing red locks.\nInstead of refugee rags, she wore a gown woven with golden embroidery.\nShe had not been wearing a necklace before, and when she raised her hand\ntoward the leader of the band, her chipped fingernails appeared perfectly\nmanicured.\n“Brightness,” the man said as she stepped up to him, “we aren’t what\nyou think we are.”\n“No,” Shallan replied. “You aren’t what you think yourselves to be.”\nThose around her in the firelight regarded her with eager stares, and she\nfelt the hair rising in a shiver across her body. Into the predator’s den\nindeed. Yet the tempest within her spurred her to action, and urged her to\ngreater confidence.\nThe leader opened his mouth as if to give some order. Shallan cut him\noff. “What is your name?”\n“I’m called Vathah,” the man said, turning toward his allies. It was a\nVorin name, like Shallan’s own. “And I’ll decide what to do with you later."

You can stop it.”\nThose dark eyes of his seemed dead. “We can’t change the past.”\n“I can change your future.”\n“We are wanted men.”\n“Yes, I came here wanting men. Hoping to find men. You are offered the\nchance to be soldiers again. Come with me. I will see to it you have new\nlives. Those lives start by saving instead of killing.”\nVathah snorted in derision. His face looked unfinished in the night,\nrough, like a sketch. “Brightlords have failed us in the past.”\n“Listen,” Shallan said. “Listen to the screams.”\nThe piteous sounds reached them from behind her. Shouts for help.\nWorkers, both men and women, from the caravan. Dying. Haunting sounds.\nShallan was surprised, despite having pointed them out, how well the\nsounds carried. How much they sounded like pleas for help.\n“Give yourself another chance,” Shallan said softly. “If you return with\nme, I will see that your crimes are erased. I promise it to you, by all that I\nhave, by the Almighty himself. You can start over. Start over as heroes.”\nVathah held her eyes. This man was stone. She could see, with a sinking\nfeeling, that he wasn’t swayed. The tempest inside of her began to fade\naway, and her fears boiled higher. What was she doing? This was crazy!\nVathah looked away from her again, and she knew she’d lost him. He\nbarked the order to take her captive.\nNobody moved. Shallan had focused only on him, not the other two\ndozen or so men, who had drawn in close, torches raised high. They looked\nat her with open faces, and she saw very little of the lust she’d noticed\nbefore. Instead, they bore wide eyes, longing, reacting to the distant yells.\nMen fingered their uniforms, where the insignias had been. Others looked\ndown at spears and axes, weapons of their service perhaps not so long ago.\n“You fools are considering this?” Vathah said.\nOne man, a short fellow with a scarred face and an eye patch, nodded\nhis head. “I wouldn’t mind starting over,” he muttered. “Storms, but it\nwould be nice.”\n“I saved a woman’s life once,” another said, a tall, balding man who\nwas easily into his forties. “I felt a hero for weeks. Toasts in the tavern.\nWarmth. Damnation! We’re dying out here.”\n“We left to get away from their oppression!” Vathah bellowed.\n“And what have we done with our freedom, Vathah?” a man asked from\nthe back of the group."

Others broke off and followed him. Shallan turned—hands clasped\nin front of her—as nearly the entire group took off in a charge. Bluth stood\nup on his wagon, his shocked face showing in the torchlight that passed.\nThen he actually whooped, jumping down from the wagon and raising his\ncudgel high as he joined the deserters charging toward the battle.\nShallan was left with Vathah and two other men. Those seemed\ndumbfounded by what had just happened. Vathah folded his arms, letting\nout an audible sigh. “Idiots, every one.”\n“They are not idiots for wanting to be better than they are,” Shallan\nsaid.\nHe snorted, looking her over. She had an immediate flash of fear.\nMoments ago, this man was ready to rob her and probably worse. He didn’t\nmake any moves toward her, though his face looked even more threatening\nnow that most of the torches had gone.\n“Who are you?” he asked.\n“Shallan Davar.”\n“Well, Brightness Shallan,” he said, “I hope for your sake you can keep\nyour word. Come on, boys. Let’s see if we can keep those fools alive.” He\nleft with the others who had remained behind, marching up over the hill\ntoward the fighting.\nShallan stood alone in the night, exhaling softly. No Light came out;\nshe’d used it all. Her feet were no longer so much as sore, but she felt\nexhausted, drained like a punctured wineskin. She walked to the wagon and\nslumped against it, then finally settled down on the ground. Head back, she\nlooked up at the sky. A few exhaustionspren rose around her, little swirls of\ndust spinning into the air.\nSalas, the first moon, made a violet disc in the center of a cluster of\nbright white stars. The screams and yells of fighting continued. Would the\ndeserters be enough? She didn’t know how many bandits there were.\nShe’d be useless there, only getting in the way. She squeezed her eyes\nshut, then climbed up into the seat and took out her sketchbook. To the\nsounds of the fighting and dying, she sketched the glyphs for a prayer of\nhope.\n“They listened,” Pattern said, buzzing from beside her. “You changed\nthem.”\n“I can’t believe it worked,” Shallan said.\n“Ah… You are good with lies.”\n“No, I mean, that was a figure of speech. It seems impossible that\nthey’d actually listen to me. Hardened criminals.”\n“You are lies and truth,” Pattern said softly. “They transform.”\n“What does that mean?” It was hard to sketch with only the light of\nSalas to see by, but she did her best.\n“You spoke of one Surge, earlier,” Pattern said. “Lightweaving, the\npower of light. But you have something else. The power of transformation.”"

Mmmm.”\nShallan finished her prayer, then held it up, noticing that a previous\npage had been ripped out of the notebook. Who had done that?\nShe couldn’t burn the prayer, but she didn’t think the Almighty would\nmind. She pressed it close to her breast and closed her eyes, waiting until\nthe shouts from below quieted.\n21. Ashes\nMediationform made for peace, it’s said.\nForm of teaching and consolation.\nWhen used by the gods, it became instead\nForm of lies and desolation.\nFrom the Listener Song of Listing, 33rd\nstanza\nShallan closed Bluth’s eyes, not looking at the ripped-out hole in his\ntorso, the bloody entrails. Around her, workers salvaged what they could\nfrom the camp. People groaned, though some of those groans cut off as\nVathah executed the bandits one by one.\nShallan didn’t stop him. He did the duty grimly, and as he walked past\nhe didn’t look at her. He’s thinking these bandits could have easily been him\nand his men, Shallan thought, looking back down at Bluth, his dead face lit\nby fires. What separates the heroes from the villains? One speech in the\nnight?\nBluth wasn’t the only casualty of the assault; Vathah had lost seven\nsoldiers. They had killed over twice that many bandits. Exhausted, Shallan\nrose, but hesitated as she saw something poking out of Bluth’s jacket. She\nleaned down and pushed the jacket open.\nThere, stuffed in his pocket, was her picture of him. The one that\ndepicted him not as he was, but as she imagined he might once have been.\nA soldier in an army, in a crisp uniform. Eyes forward, rather than looking\ndown all the time. A hero.\nWhen had he taken it from her sketchbook? She slipped it free and\nfolded it, flattening the wrinkles.\n“I was wrong,” she whispered. “You were a fine way to restart my\ncollection, Bluth. Fight well for the Almighty in your sleep, bold one.”\nShe rose and looked over the camp. Several of the caravan’s parshmen\npulled corpses to the fires for burning. Shallan’s intervention had rescued\nthe merchants, but not without heavy losses. She hadn’t counted, but the toll\nlooked high. Dozens dead, including most of the caravan’s guards—among\nthem the Iriali man from earlier in the night.\nIn her fatigue, Shallan wanted to crawl into her wagon and curl up for\nsleep. Instead, she went looking for the caravan leaders.\nThe haggard, bloodstained scout from before stood beside a travel table,\nwhere she was talking to an older, bearded man in a felt cap. His eyes were\nblue, and he moved his fingers through his beard as he looked over a list the\nwoman had brought him.\nBoth looked up as Shallan approached. The woman rested a hand on her"

The woman rested a hand on her\nsword; the man continued to stroke his beard. Nearby, caravan workers\nsorted through the contents of a wagon that had toppled over, spilling bales\nof cloth.\n“And here is our savior,” the older man said. “Brightness, the winds\nthemselves cannot speak of your majesty or the wonder of your timely\narrival.”\nShallan didn’t feel majestic. She felt tired, sore, and grungy. Her bare\nfeet—hidden by the bottom of her skirts—had started to ache again, and her\nability to Lightweave was expended. Her dress looked almost as bad as a\npauper’s, and her hair—though braided—was an absolute mess.\n“You are the caravan owner?” Shallan asked.\n“Macob is my name,” he said. She couldn’t place his accent. Not\nThaylen or Alethi. “You have met my associate Tyn.” He nodded toward the\nwoman. “She is head of our guards. Both her soldiers and my goods have…\ndwindled from tonight’s encounters.”\nTyn folded her arms. She still wore her tan coat, and in the light of\nMacob’s spheres, Shallan could see that it was of fine leather. What to make\nof a woman who dressed like a soldier and wore a sword at her waist?\n“I’ve been telling Macob of your offer,” Tyn said. “Earlier, on the hill.”\nMacob chuckled, an incongruous sound considering their surroundings.\n“Offer, she calls it. My associate is under the impression that it was really a\nthreat! These mercenaries obviously work for you. We are wondering what\nyour intention is for this caravan.”\n“The mercenaries didn’t work for me before,” Shallan said, “but they do\nnow. It took a little persuasion.”\nTyn raised an eyebrow. “That must have been some mighty fine\npersuasion, Brightness…”\n“Shallan Davar. All I ask of you is what I said to Tyn before.\nAccompany me to the Shattered Plains.”\n“Surely your soldiers can do that,” Macob said. “You don’t need our\nassistance.”\nI want you here to remind the “soldiers” what they’ve done, Shallan\nthought. Her instincts said that the more reminders of civilization the\ndeserters had, the better off she would be.\n“They are soldiers,” Shallan said. “They have no idea how to properly\nconvey a lighteyed woman in comfort. You, however, have nice wagons and\ngoods aplenty. If you can’t tell from my humble aspect, I am in dreadful\nneed of a little luxury. I’d rather not arrive at the Shattered Plains looking\nlike a vagabond.”\n“We could use her soldiers,” Tyn said. “My own force is reduced to a\nhandful.” She inspected Shallan again, this time with curiosity. It wasn’t an\nunfriendly look.\n“Then we shall make an accord,” Macob said, smiling broadly and\nreaching across the table toward Shallan. “In my gratitude for my life, I\nshall see you cared for with new apparel and fine foodstuffs for the duration\nof our travels together.

I suppose not.” He\nreleased her hand, then waved toward a pair of people off at the side of the\nwagons. Tvlakv and Tag. “And what of those?”\n“They are mine,” Shallan said. “I will deal with them.”\n“Just keep them at the back of the caravan, if you will,” Macob said,\nwrinkling his nose. “Grimy business. I’d rather not our caravan stink of\nthose wares. Either way, you’d best be about gathering your people. There\nwill be a highstorm soon. With our lost wagons, we have no extra shelter.”\nShallan left them and made her way across the valley, trying to ignore\nthe mingled stench of blood and char. A shape split from the darkness,\nmoving in beside her. Vathah didn’t look any less intimidating in the better\nlight here.\n“Well?” Shallan asked him.\n“Some of my men are dead,” he said, his voice a monotone.\n“They died doing a very good work,” Shallan said, “and the families of\nthese who lived will bless them for their sacrifice.”\nVathah took her arm, pulling her to a stop. His grip was firm, even\npainful. “You don’t look like you did before,” he said. She hadn’t realized\nhow much he towered over her. “Did my eyes mistake me? I saw a queen in\nthe darkness. Now I see a child.”\n“Perhaps you saw what your conscience needed you to see,” Shallan\nsaid, tugging—unsuccessfully—on her arm. She blushed.\nVathah leaned in. His breath wasn’t particularly sweet. “My men have\ndone worse things than this,” he whispered, waving his other hand at the\nburning dead. “Out in the wilderness, we took. We killed. You think one\nnight absolves us? You think one night will stop the nightmares?”\nShallan felt a hollowness in her stomach.\n“If we go with you to the Shattered Plains, we’re dead men,” Vathah\nsaid. “We’ll be hanged the moment we return.”\n“My word—”\n“Your word means nothing, woman!” he shouted, grip tensing.\n“You should let her go,” Pattern said calmly from behind him.\nVathah spun, looking about, but they weren’t near anyone in particular.\nShallan spotted Pattern on the back of Vathah’s uniform as he turned.\n“Who said that?” Vathah demanded.\n“I heard nothing,” Shallan said, somehow managing to sound calm.\n“You should let her go,” Pattern repeated.\nVathah looked around again, then back at Shallan, who met his gaze\nwith a level stare. She even forced out a smile.\nHe let go of her and wiped his hand on his trousers, then retreated."

He smiled toward Shallan as she\narrived, though the expression seemed particularly thin on him today.\n“So,” he asked conversationally, “were you in on it from the start?”\n“In on what?” Shallan asked wearily, shooing Tag away so she could\ntalk to Tvlakv in private.\n“Bluth’s plan.”\n“Please, do tell.”\n“Obviously,” Tvlakv said, “he was in league with the deserters. That\nfirst night, when he came running back to the camp, he’d met with them\nand promised to let them take us if he could share in the wealth. That was\nwhy they did not immediately kill you two when you went to speak with\nthem.”\n“Oh?” Shallan asked. “And if that were the case, why did Bluth come\nback and warn us that night? Why did he flee with us, instead of just letting\nhis ‘friends’ kill us right then?”\n“Perhaps he only met with a few of them,” Tvlakv said. “Yes, they lit\nfires on that hillside in the night to make us think there were more, and then\nhis friends went to gather a larger crowd… And…” He deflated. “Storms.\nThat doesn’t make any sense. But how, why? We should be dead.”\n“The Almighty preserved us,” Shallan said.\n“Your Almighty is a farce.”\n“You should hope he is,” Shallan said, walking to the back of Tag’s\nwagon nearby. “For if he is not, then Damnation itself awaits men like\nyou.” She inspected the cage. Five slaves in grimy clothing huddled inside,\neach one looking alone, though they were crammed in close.\n“These are mine now,” Shallan told Tvlakv.\n“What!” he stood up on his seat. “You—”\n“I saved your life, you oily little man,” Shallan said. “You will give me\nthese slaves in payment. Dues in recompense for my soldiers protecting you\nand your worthless life.”\n“This is robbery.”\n“This is justice. If it bothers you, submit a grievance with the king in the\nShattered Plains, once we arrive.”\n“I’m not going to the Shattered Plains,” Tvlakv spat. “You have\nsomeone else to convey you now, Brightness.

I’m very good at spotting a forgery.”\nShe hadn’t ever even seen a writ of slavery, and wouldn’t know how to\ntell if one was faked. She didn’t care. She was tired, frustrated, and eager to\nbe done with this night.\nOne by one, five hesitant slaves stepped from the wagon, shaggy\nbearded and shirtless. Her trip with Tvlakv had not been pleasant, but it had\nbeen luxurious compared to what these men had been through. Several\nglanced at the darkness nearby, as if eager.\n“You may run if you wish,” Shallan said, softening her tone. “I will not\nhunt you. I need servants, however, and I will pay you well. Six firemarks a\nweek if you agree to put five of them toward paying down your slave debt.\nOne if you don’t.”\nOne of the men cocked his head. “So… we take away the same amount\neither way? What kind of sense does that make?”\n“The best kind,” Shallan said, turning to Tvlakv, who sat stewing on the\nside of his seat. “You have three wagons but only two drivers. Will you sell\nme the third wagon?” She wouldn’t need the chull—Macob would have an\nextra she could use, since several of his wagons had burned.\n“Sell the wagon? Bah! Why not just steal it from me?”\n“Stop being a child, Tvlakv. Do you want my money or not?”\n“Five sapphire broams,” he snapped. “And it’s a steal at that price; don’t\nyou argue otherwise.”\nShe didn’t know if it was or not, but she could afford it, with the spheres\nshe had, even if most of them were dun.\n“You can’t have my parshmen,” Tvlakv snapped.\n“You can keep them,” Shallan said. She would need to talk to the\ncaravan master about shoes and clothing for her servants.\nAs she walked off to see if she could use an extra chull of Macob’s, she\npassed a group of the caravan workers waiting to the side of one of the\nbonfires. The deserters threw the last body—one of their own—into the\nflames, then stepped back, wiping brows.\nOne of the darkeyed caravan women stepped up, holding out a sheet of\npaper to a former deserter. He took it, scratching at his beard. He was the\nshorter, one-eyed man who’d spoken during her speech. He held up the\nsheet to the others. It was a prayer made from familiar runes, but not one of\nmourning, as Shallan would have expected to see. It was a prayer of thanks.\nThe former deserters gathered in front of the flames and looked at the\nprayer.

Violent shaking,\nwith water seeping in at the joints. Something was out there, in the dark\nchaos of the highstorm. It thrashed and pounded at the window, wanting in.\nLight flashed out there, glistening through the drops of water. Another\nflash.\nThen the light stayed. Steady, like glowing spheres, just outside. Faintly\nred. For some reason he couldn’t explain, Kaladin had the impression of\neyes.\nTransfixed, he raised his hand toward the latch, to open it and see.\n“Someone really needs to fix that loose shutter,” King Elhokar said,\nannoyed.\nThe light faded. The rattling stopped. Kaladin blinked, lowering his\nhand.\n“Someone remind me to ask Nakal to see to it,” Elhokar said, pacing\nbehind his couch. “The shutter shouldn’t leak. This is my palace, not a\nvillage tavern!”\n“We’ll make sure it’s seen to,” Adolin said. He sat in a chair beside the\nhearth, flipping through a book filled with sketches. His brother sat in a\nchair next to him, hands clasped in his lap. He was probably sore from his\ntraining, but he didn’t show it. Instead, he had gotten a small box out of his\npocket and was repeatedly opening it, turning it in his hand, rubbing one\nside, then shutting it with a click.

        "text": "he had run. However, when the horns for a plateau run sounded, Idrin\nwould turn toward them and his expression would grow longing. He wanted\nto be out there fighting. Sadeas’s betrayal had made a lot of the soldiers in\ncamp similarly eager—as if they wanted the chance to prove how strong\nDalinar’s army was.\nMore rumbling came from the storm outside. It was odd not to be cold\nduring a highstorm—the barrack always felt chilly. This room was well\nheated, though not by a fire. Instead, the hearth held a ruby the size of\nKaladin’s fist, one that could have paid to feed everyone in his hometown\nfor weeks.\nKaladin left the window and sauntered toward the fireplace under the\npretext of inspecting the gemstone. He really wanted a glimpse of whatever\nit was Adolin was looking through. Many men refused to even look at\nbooks, considering it unmasculine. Adolin didn’t seem to be bothered by\nthat. Curious.\nAs he approached the hearth, Kaladin passed the door to a side room\nwhere Dalinar and Navani had retired at the advent of the storm. Kaladin\nhad wanted to post a guard inside. They’d refused.\nWell, this is the only way into that room, he thought. There’s not even a\nwindow. This time, if words appeared on the wall, he would know for\ncertain nobody was sneaking in.\nKaladin stooped down, inspecting the ruby in the hearth, which was\nheld in place by a wire enclosure. Its strong heat made his face prickle with\nsweat; storms, that ruby was so large that the Light infusing it should have\nblinded him. Instead, he could stare into its depths and see the Light moving\ninside.\nPeople thought that the illumination from gemstones was steady and\ncalm, but that was just in contrast to flickering candlelight. If you looked\ndeeply into a stone, you could see the Light shifting with the chaotic pattern\nof a blowing storm. It was not calm inside. Not by a wind or a whisper.\n“Never seen a heating fabrial before, I assume?” Renarin asked.\nKaladin glanced at the bespectacled prince. He wore an Alethi\nhighlord’s uniform, like that of Adolin. In fact, Kaladin had never seen them\nwearing anything else—other than Shardplate, of course.\n“No, I haven’t,” Kaladin said.\n“New technology,” Renarin said, still playing with his little metal box.\n“My aunt built that one herself. Every time I turn around, it seems the world\nhas changed somehow.”\nKaladin grunted. I know how that feels. Part of him yearned to suck in\nthe Light of that gemstone. A foolish move. There’d be enough in there to\nmake him glow like a bonfire. He lowered his hands and strolled past\nAdolin’s chair.\nThe sketches in Adolin’s book were of men in fine clothing. The\ndrawings were quite good, their faces done in as much detail as their\ngarments.\n“Fashion?” Kaladin asked. He hadn’t intended to speak, but it came out\nanyway. “You’re spending the highstorm looking for new clothing?”\nAdolin snapped the book closed.\n“But you only wear uniforms,” Kaladin said, confused."

        "text": "anyway. “You’re spending the highstorm looking for new clothing?”\nAdolin snapped the book closed.\n“But you only wear uniforms,” Kaladin said, confused.\n“Do you need to be here, bridgeboy?” Adolin demanded. “Surely\nnobody is going to come for us during a highstorm, of all things.”\n“The fact that you assume that,” Kaladin said, “is why I need to be here.\nWhat better time would there be for an assassination attempt? The winds\nwould cover shouts, and help would be slow in coming when everyone has\ntaken cover to wait out the storm. Seems to me this is one of the times when\nHis Majesty most needs guards.”\nThe king stopped pacing and pointed. “That makes sense. Why hasn’t\nanyone else ever explained that to me?” He looked at Idrin, who remained\nstoic.\nAdolin sighed. “You could at least leave Renarin and me out of it,” he\nsaid softly to Kaladin.\n“It’s easier to protect you when you’re all together, Brightlord,” Kaladin\nsaid, walking away. “Plus, you can defend each other.”\nDalinar had been intending to stay with Navani during the storm\nanyway. Kaladin approached the window again, listening to the storm pass\noutside. Had he really seen the things he thought he had during his time out\nin the storm? A face as vast as the sky? The Stormfather himself?\nI am a god, Syl had said. A little piece of one.\nEventually, the storm passed, and Kaladin opened the window to a black\nsky, a few phantom clouds shining with Nomon’s light. The storm had\nstarted a few hours into the night, but nobody could sleep during a storm.\nHe hated when a highstorm came so late; he often felt exhausted the next\nday.\nThe side room door opened and Dalinar stepped out, trailed by Navani.\nThe statuesque woman carried a large notebook. Kaladin had heard, of\ncourse, about the highprince’s fits during storms. His men were divided on\nthe topic. Some thought Dalinar was frightened of highstorms, and his\nterror sent him into convulsions. Others whispered that with age, the\nBlackthorn was losing his mind.\nKaladin badly wanted to know which it was. His fate, and that of his\nmen, was tied to this man’s health.\n“Numbers, sir?” Kaladin asked, peeking into the room, looking at the\nwalls.\n“No,” Dalinar said.\n“Sometimes they come just after the storm,” Kaladin said. “I have men\nin the hall outside. I would prefer if everyone remained here for a short\ntime.”\nDalinar nodded. “As you wish, soldier.”\nKaladin walked to the exit. Beyond, some men of Bridge Four and of\nthe King’s Guard stood on watch. Kaladin nodded to Leyten, then pointed\nfor them to watch out on the balcony. Kaladin would catch the phantom\nscratching those numbers. If, indeed, such a person existed.\nBehind, Renarin and Adolin approached their father. “Anything new?”\nRenarin asked softly.\n“No,” Dalinar said. “The vision was a repeat. But they’re not coming in\nthe same order as last time, and some are new, so perhaps there is\nsomething to learn we have not yet discovered…” Noticing Kaladin, he"

        "text": "the same order as last time, and some are new, so perhaps there is\nsomething to learn we have not yet discovered…” Noticing Kaladin, he\ntrailed off, then changed the topic. “Well, as long as we’re waiting here,\nperhaps I can get an update. Adolin, when can we expect more duels?”\n“I’m trying,” Adolin said with a grimace. “I thought beating Salinor\nwould drive others to want to try me, but they’re stalling instead.”\n“Problematic,” Navani said. “Weren’t you always saying that everyone\nwanted to duel you?”\n“They did!” Adolin said. “When I couldn’t duel, at least. Now, every\ntime I make an offer, people start shuffling their feet and looking away.”\n“Have you tried anyone in Sadeas’s camp?” the king asked eagerly.\n“No,” Adolin said. “But he’s only got one Shardbearer other than\nhimself. Amaram.”\nKaladin felt a shiver.\n“Well, you won’t be dueling him,” Dalinar said, chuckling. He sat down\non the couch, Brightness Navani settling in beside him, hand fondly on his\nknee. “We might have him on our side. I’ve been speaking to Highlord\nAmaram…”\n“You think you can get him to secede?” the king asked.\n“Is that possible?” Kaladin asked, surprised.\nThe lighteyes turned to him. Navani blinked, as if noticing him for the\nfirst time.\n“Yes, it is possible,” Dalinar said. “Most of the territory that Amaram\noversees would remain with Sadeas, but he could bring his personal land to\nmy princedom—along with his Shards. Usually it requires a land trade with\na princedom bordering the one a highlord wishes to join.”\n“It hasn’t happened in over a decade,” Adolin said, shaking his head.\n“I’m working on him,” Dalinar said. “But Amaram… he wants to bring\nSadeas and me together instead. He thinks we can get along again.”\nAdolin snorted. “That possibility blew away the day Sadeas betrayed\nus.”\n“Probably long before that day,” Dalinar said, “even if I didn’t see it. Is\nthere anyone else you could challenge, Adolin?”\n“I’m going to try Talanor,” Adolin said, “and then Kalishor.”\n“Neither full Shardbearers,” Navani said with a frown. “The first has\nonly the Blade, the second only the Plate.”\n“All of the full Shardbearers have refused me,” Adolin said with a\nshrug. “Those two are eager, thirsty for notoriety. One of them might agree\nwhere others haven’t.”\nKaladin folded his arms, leaning back against the wall. “And if you\ndefeat them, won’t it scare off others from fighting you?”\n“When I beat them,” Adolin said, glancing at Kaladin’s relaxed posture\nand frowning, “Father will maneuver others into agreeing to duels.”\n“But it will have to stop sometime, right?” Kaladin asked. “Eventually\nthe other highprinces will realize what’s happening. They’ll refuse to be\ngoaded into further duels. It might be happening already. That’s why they\ndon’t accept.”"

That’s why they\ndon’t accept.”\n“Someone will,” Adolin said, standing. “And once I start winning,\nothers will begin to see me as a real challenge. They’ll want to test\nthemselves.”\nThat seemed optimistic to Kaladin.\n“Captain Kaladin is right,” Dalinar said.\nAdolin turned toward his father.\n“There’s no need to fight every Shardbearer in camp,” Dalinar said\nsoftly. “We need to narrow our attack, choose duels for you that point us\ntoward the ultimate goal.”\n“Which is?” Adolin asked.\n“Undermining Sadeas.” Dalinar almost sounded regretful. “Killing him\nin a duel, if we have to. Everyone in camp knows the sides in this power\nstruggle. This won’t work if we punish everyone equally. We need to show\nthose in the middle, those deciding whom to follow, the advantages of trust.\nCooperation on plateau runs. Help from one another’s Shardbearers. We\nshow them what it’s like to be part of a real kingdom.”\nThe others grew quiet. The king turned away with a shake of his head.\nHe didn’t believe, at least not fully, in what Dalinar wished to achieve.\nKaladin found himself annoyed. Why should he be? Dalinar had agreed\nwith him. He stewed for a moment, and realized that he was probably still\nupset because someone had mentioned Amaram.\nEven hearing the man’s name put Kaladin out of sorts. He kept thinking\nsomething should happen, something should change, now that such a\nmurderer was in camp. Yet everything just kept on going. It was frustrating.\nMade him want to lash out.\nHe needed to do something about it.\n“I assume we’ve waited long enough?” Adolin said to his father. “I can\ngo?”\nDalinar sighed, nodding. Adolin pulled open the door and strode away;\nRenarin followed at a slower pace, hauling that Shardblade he was still\nbonding, sheathed in its protective strips. As they passed the group of\nguards Kaladin had put outside, Skar and three others broke off to follow\nthem.\nKaladin walked to the door, doing a quick count of who was left. Four\nmen total. “Moash,” Kaladin said, noticing the man yawning. “How long\nhave you been on duty today?”\nMoash shrugged. “One shift guarding Brightness Navani. One shift with\nthe King’s Guard.”\nI’m working them too hard, Kaladin thought. Stormfather. I don’t have\nenough men. Even with the leftover Cobalt Guard that Dalinar is sending to\nme. “Head back and get some sleep,” Kaladin said. “You too, Bisig. I saw\nyou on shift this morning.”\n“And you?” Moash asked Kaladin.\n“I’m fine.” He had Stormlight to keep him alert. True, using Stormlight\nthat way could be dangerous—it provoked him to act, to be more impulsive.\nHe wasn’t sure he liked what it did to him when he used it outside of battle.\nMoash raised an eyebrow. “You’ve got to be at least as tired as I am,\nKal.”"

That was important. Moash needed to\nthink like a bodyguard, and there was no better way than serving on an\nalready-established crew.\n“My shift here with the King’s Guard is almost over,” Moash noted.\n“I’ll head back after.”\n“Fine,” Kaladin said. “Keep Leyten with you. Natam, you and Mart\nguard Brightness Navani. I’ll see Dalinar back to camp and post guards at\nhis door.”\n“Then you’ll get some sleep?” Moash asked. The others glanced at\nKaladin. They were worried as well.\n“Yes, fine.” Kaladin turned back to the room, where Dalinar was\nhelping Navani to her feet. He’d walk her to her door, as he did most\nevenings.\nKaladin debated for a moment, then stepped up to the highprince. “Sir,\nthere’s something I need to talk to you about.”\n“Can it wait until I’m done here?” Dalinar said.\n“Yes, sir,” Kaladin said. “I’ll wait at the palace’s front doors, then will\nbe your guard on the way back to camp.”\nDalinar led Navani away, joined by two bridgeman guards. Kaladin\nmade his own way down the corridor, thinking. Servants had already come\nby to open the corridor windows, and Syl floated in through one as a\nspinning swirl of mist. Giggling, she spun around him a few times before\ngoing out another window. She always got more sprenlike during a\nhighstorm.\nThe air smelled wet and fresh. The whole world felt clean after a\nhighstorm, scrubbed by nature’s abrasive.\nHe reached the front of the palace, where a pair of the King’s Guard\nstood on watch. Kaladin nodded to them and got crisp salutes in return, then\nhe fetched a sphere lantern from the guard post and filled it with his own\nspheres.\nFrom the front of the palace, Kaladin could look out over all ten\nwarcamps. As always after a storm, the Light of refreshed spheres sparkled\neverywhere, their gemstones ablaze with captured fragments of the tempest\nthat had passed.\nStanding there, Kaladin confronted what he needed to say to Dalinar. He\nrehearsed it silently more than once, but still wasn’t ready when the\nhighprince emerged at last from the palace doors. Natam saluted from\nbehind them, handing Dalinar off to Kaladin, then jogged back to join Mart\noutside Brightness Navani’s door.\nThe highprince started down the switchbacks of the side route down\nfrom the Pinnacle to the stables below. Kaladin fell in beside him. Dalinar\nappeared deeply distracted by something.\nHe hasn’t ever announced anything about his fits during highstorms,\nKaladin thought. Shouldn’t he say something?"

Shouldn’t he say something?\nThey’d talked about visions, earlier. What was it Dalinar saw, or thought\nhe saw?\n“So, soldier,” Dalinar said as they walked. “What is it you wanted to\ndiscuss?”\nKaladin took a deep breath. “A year ago, I was a soldier in Amaram’s\narmy.”\n“So that’s where you learned,” Dalinar said. “I should have guessed.\nAmaram is the only general in Sadeas’s princedom with any real leadership\nability.”\n“Sir,” Kaladin said, stopping on the steps. “He betrayed me and my\nmen.”\nDalinar stopped and turned to look at him. “A poor battle decision,\nthen? Nobody is perfect, soldier. If he sent your men into a bad situation, I\ndoubt he intended to do so.”\nJust push through it, Kaladin told himself, noticing Syl sitting on a\nshalebark ridge just to the right. She nodded at him. He has to know. It was\njust…\nHe’d never spoken of this, not in full. Not even to Rock, Teft, and the\nothers.\n“It wasn’t that, sir,” Kaladin said, meeting Dalinar’s eyes by spherelight.\n“I know where Amaram got his Shardblade. I was there. I killed the\nShardbearer carrying it.”\n“That can’t be the case,” Dalinar said slowly. “If you had, you’d hold\nthe Plate and Blade.”\n“Amaram took it for himself, then slaughtered everyone who knew the\ntruth,” Kaladin said. “Everyone but a lone soldier who, in his guilt, Amaram\nbranded a slave and sold rather than murdering.”\nDalinar stood in silence. From this angle, the hillside behind him was\ncompletely dark, lit only by stars. A few spheres glowed in Dalinar’s\npocket, shining through the fabric of his uniform.\n“Amaram is one of the best men I know,” Dalinar said. “His honor is\nspotless. I’ve never even known him to take undue advantage of an\nopponent in a duel, despite cases when it would have been acceptable.”\nKaladin didn’t respond. He’d believed that too, at one point.\n“Do you have any proof?” Dalinar asked. “You understand that I can’t\ntake one man’s word on something of this nature.”\n“One darkeyed man’s word, you mean,” Kaladin said, gritting his teeth.\n“It’s not the color of your eyes that is the problem,” Dalinar said, “but\nthe severity of your accusation. The words you speak are dangerous. Do\nyou have any proof, soldier?”\n“There were others there when he took the Shards. Men of his personal\nguard did the actual killing at his command. And there was a stormwarden\nthere. Middle-aged, with a peaked face. He wore a beard like an ardent.” He\npaused. “They were all complicit in the act, but maybe…”\nDalinar sighed softly in the night. “Have you spoken this accusation to\nanyone else?”\n“No,” Kaladin said.\n“Continue to hold your tongue. I’ll talk to Amaram. Thank you for\ntelling me of this.”"

Thank you for\ntelling me of this.”\n“Sir,” Kaladin said, taking a step closer to Dalinar. “If you really believe\nin justice, you—”\n“That’s enough for the moment, son,” Dalinar cut in, voice calm but\ncool. “You’ve had your say, unless you can offer me anything else by way\nof evidence.”\nKaladin forced down his immediate burst of anger. It was difficult.\n“I appreciated your input when we were talking about my son’s duels\nearlier,” Dalinar said. “This is the second time you’ve added something\nimportant to one of our conferences, I believe.”\n“Thank you, sir.”\n“But soldier,” Dalinar said, “you’re walking quite a line between\nhelpfulness and insubordination in the way you treat me and mine. You\nhave a chip on your shoulder the size of a boulder. I ignore it, because I\nknow what was done to you, and I can see the soldier beneath. That’s the\nman I hired for this job.”\nKaladin ground his teeth, and nodded. “Yes, sir.”\n“Good. Now run along.”\n“Sir, but I must escort—”\n“I think I’ll return to the palace,” Dalinar said. “I don’t think I’ll get\nmuch sleep tonight, so I might want to pester the dowager with my\nthoughts. Her guards can watch over me. I’ll take one with me when I\nreturn to my camp.”\nKaladin let out a long breath. Then saluted. Fine, he thought, continuing\ndown the dark, damp path. When he reached the bottom, Dalinar was still\nstanding up above, now just a shadow. He seemed lost in thought.\nKaladin turned and walked back toward Dalinar’s warcamp. Syl flitted\nup and landed on his shoulder. “See,” she said. “He listened.”\n“No he didn’t, Syl.”\n“What? He replied and said—”\n“I told him something he didn’t want to hear,” Kaladin said. “Even if he\ndoes look into it, he’ll find plenty of reasons to dismiss what I said. In the\nend, it will be my word against Amaram’s. Stormfather! I shouldn’t have\nsaid anything.”\n“You’d let it go, then?”\n“Storms, no,” Kaladin said. “I’d find my own justice.”\n“Oh…” Syl settled on his shoulder.\nThey walked for a long while, eventually approaching the warcamp.\n“You’re not a Skybreaker, Kaladin,” Syl finally said. “You’re not\nsupposed to be like this.”\n“A what?” he asked, stepping over scuttling cremlings in the dark. They\ncame out in force after a storm, when plants unfolded to lap up the water.\n“That was one of the orders, wasn’t it?” He did know some little of them.\nEveryone did, from the legends.\n“Yes,” Syl said, voice soft. “I’m worried about you, Kaladin. I thought\nthings would be better, once you were free from the bridges.”\n“Things are better,” he said. “None of my men have been killed since\nwe were freed.”\n“But you…” She didn’t seem to know what else to say. “I thought you"

Once again, light and motion surrounded him, people\nrunning quick errands, parshmen repairing buildings damaged by the storm.\n“During my time as a bridgeman, all I had to worry about was my men.\nNow things are different. I have to become someone. I just don’t know who\nyet.”\nWhen he reached Bridge Four’s barrack, Rock was dishing out the\nevening stew. Far later than usual, but some of the men were on odd shifts.\nThe men weren’t limited to stew any longer, but they still insisted on it for\nthe evening meal.

Kaladin had instilled in them a respect for it,\nmuch as a soldier respected his spear.\nStew. Bridges. They spoke so fondly of things that had once been\nemblems of their captivity.

He had\ntan skin, like an Alethi, but he didn’t seem to have the right face shape.\nHerdazian?\n“Oh, don’t mind Punio,” Lopen called from nearby. “He’s my cousin.”\n“You had a cousin on the bridge crews?” Kaladin asked.\n“Nah,” Lopen said. “He just heard my mother say we needed more\nguards, so he came to help. I got him a uniform and things.”\nThe newcomer, Punio, smiled and raised his spoon. “Bridge Four,” he\nsaid with a thick Herdazian accent.\n“Are you a soldier?” Kaladin asked him.\n“Yes,” the man said. “Brightlord Roion army. Not worry. I swore to\nKholin instead, now. For my cousin.” He smiled affably.\n“You can’t just leave your army, Punio,” Kaladin said, rubbing his\nforehead. “It’s called desertion.”\n“Not for us,” Lopen called. “We’re Herdazian—nobody can tell us apart\nanyway.”\n“Yes,” Punio said. “I leave for the homeland once a year. When I come\nback, nobody remembers me.” He shrugged. “This time, I come here.”\nKaladin sighed, but the man looked like he knew his way around a\nspear, and Kaladin did need more men. “Fine. Just pretend you were one of\nthe bridgemen from the start, all right?”\n“Bridge Four!” the man said enthusiastically.\nKaladin passed him and found his customary place by the fire to relax\nand think. He didn’t get that chance, however, as someone stepped up and\nsquatted down before him. A man with marbled skin and a Bridge Four\nuniform.\n“Shen?” Kaladin asked.\n“Sir.”\nShen continued to stare at him."

Here was a man who, unlike the others,\nwasn’t welcome to leave and make his way in the world. Dalinar had freed\nthe rest of Bridge Four—but a parshman… he’d be a slave no matter where\nhe went or what he did.\nWhat could Kaladin say? Storms.\n“I appreciate your help when we were scavenging. I know it was\ndifficult for you to see what we did down there sometimes.”\nShen waited, still squatting, listening. He regarded Kaladin with those\nimpenetrable, solid black parshman eyes of his.\n“I can’t start arming parshmen, Shen,” Kaladin said. “The lighteyes\nbarely accept us as it is. If I gave you a spear, think of the storm it would\ncause.”\nShen nodded, face displaying no hint of his emotions. He stood up\nstraight. “A slave I am, then.”\nHe withdrew.\nKaladin knocked his head back against the stone behind him, staring up\nat the sky. Storming man. He had a good life, for a parshman. Certainly\nmore freedom than any other of his kind.\nAnd were you satisfied with that? a voice inside him asked. Were you\nhappy to be a well-treated slave? Or did you try to run, fight your way to\nfreedom?\nWhat a mess. He mulled over those thoughts, digging into his stew. He\ngot two bites down before Natam—one of the men who’d been guarding at\nthe palace—came stumbling into their camp, sweating, frantic, and red-\ncheeked from running.\n“The king!” Natam said, puffing. “An assassin.”\n23.

He hadn’t thought that his\nprotectiveness could apply to lighteyes.\n“Well, at least he ran here,” the king said, waving off the attentions of a\nwoman who was trying to bandage a gash on his forehead. “You see, Idrin.\nThis is what a good bodyguard looks like. I bet he wouldn’t have let this\nhappen.”\nThe captain of the King’s Guard stood near the door, red-faced. He\nlooked away, then stalked out into the hallway. Kaladin raised a hand to his\nhead, bewildered. Comments like that one from the king were not going to\nhelp his men get along with Dalinar’s soldiers.\nInside the room, a mess of guards, servants, and members of Bridge\nFour stood around, looking confused or embarrassed. Natam was there—\nhe’d been on duty with the King’s Guard—as was Moash.\n“Moash,” Kaladin called. “You’re supposed to be back in the camp\nasleep.”\n“So are you,” Moash said.\nKaladin grunted, trotting over, speaking more softly. “Were you here\nwhen it happened?”\n“I’d just left,” Moash said. “Finishing my shift with the King’s Guard. I\nheard yelling, and came back as quickly as I could.” He nodded toward the\nopen balcony door. “Come have a look.”\nThey walked out onto the balcony, which was a circular stone pathway\nthat ran around the peak rooms of the palace—a terrace cut into the stone\nitself. From such a height, the balcony offered an unparalleled view\noverlooking the warcamps and the Plains beyond. Some members of the\nKing’s Guard stood here, inspecting the balcony railing with sphere lamps.\nA section of the ironwork structure had twisted outward and hung\nprecariously over the drop.\n“From what we’ve figured,” Moash said, pointing, “the king came out\nhere to think, as he likes to do.”\nKaladin nodded, walking with Moash. The stone floor beneath was still\nwet from highstorm rain. They reached the place where the railing was\nripped, several guards making way for them. Kaladin looked down over the\nside. The drop was a good hundred feet onto the rocks below. Syl drifted\nthrough the air down there, making lazy glowing circles.\n“Damnation, Kaladin!” Moash said, taking his arm. “Are you trying to\nmake me panic?”\nI wonder if I could survive that fall… He’d dropped half that once\nbefore, filled with Stormlight, and had landed without trouble. He stepped\nback for Moash’s sake, though even before gaining his special abilities,\nheights had fascinated him. It felt liberating to be up so high. Just you and\nthe air itself.\nHe knelt down, looking at the places where the footings of the iron\nrailing had been mortared into holes in the stone. “The railing pulled free of\nits mountings?” he asked, poking his finger into a hole, then pulling it out\nwith mortar dust on his fingers.\n“Yeah,” Moash said, several of the men of the king’s guard nodding.\n“Could just be a flaw in the design,” Kaladin said."

It fell right out. Barely a sound. I was\nstanding here, looking out at the Plains and thinking to myself, and next I\nknew His Majesty was hanging right there, holding on for his life and\ncursing like a caravan worker.” The guard blushed. “Sir.”\nKaladin stood, inspecting the metalwork. So the king had leaned against\nthis section of the railing, and it had bent forward—the mountings at the\nbottom giving way. It had almost come free completely, but fortunately one\nbar had held tight. The king had grabbed hold and clung to it long enough to\nbe rescued.\nThis should never have been possible. The thing looked as if it had been\nconstructed of wood and rope first, then Soulcast into iron. Shaking another\nsection, he found it incredibly secure. Even a few footings giving out\nshouldn’t have let the whole thing fall off—the metal pieces would have\nhad to come apart.\nHe moved to the right, inspecting some of those that had ripped free of\none another. The two pieces of metal had been sheared at a joint. Smoothly,\ncleanly.\nThe doorway into the king’s chamber darkened as Dalinar Kholin\nstepped out onto the balcony. “In,” he said to Moash and the other guards.\n“Close the door. I’d like to speak to Captain Kaladin.”\nThey obeyed, though Moash went reluctantly. Dalinar walked up to\nKaladin as the windows closed, giving them privacy. Despite his age, the\nhighprince’s figure was an intimidating one, wide shouldered, built like a\nbrick wall.\n“Sir,” Kaladin said. “I should have—”\n“This wasn’t your fault,” Dalinar said. “The king wasn’t under your\ncare. Even if he was, I wouldn’t reprimand you—just as I won’t reprimand\nIdrin. I wouldn’t expect bodyguards to inspect architecture.”\n“Yes, sir,” Kaladin said.\nDalinar knelt down to inspect the mountings. “You like to take\nresponsibility for things, don’t you? A commendable attribute in an officer.”\nDalinar rose and looked at the place where the rail had been cut. “What is\nyour assessment?”\n“Someone definitely chipped at the mortar,” Kaladin said, “and\nsabotaged the railing.”\nDalinar nodded. “I agree. This was a deliberate attempt on the king’s\nlife.”\n“However… sir…”\n“Yes?”\n“Whoever tried this is an idiot.”\nDalinar looked to him, raising an eyebrow in the lantern light.\n“How could they know where the king would lean?” Kaladin said. “Or\neven that he would? This trap could easily have caught someone else, and\nthen the would-be assassins would have exposed themselves for nothing. In\nfact, that is what happened. The king survived, and now we’re aware of\nthem.”\n“We’ve been expecting assassins,” Dalinar said. “And not just because\nof the incident with the king’s armor. Half the powerful men in this camp"

        "text": "them.”\n“We’ve been expecting assassins,” Dalinar said. “And not just because\nof the incident with the king’s armor. Half the powerful men in this camp\nare probably contemplating some kind of assassination attempt, so an\nattempt on Elhokar’s life doesn’t tell us as much as you’d think. As to how\nthey knew to catch him here, he has a favorite spot for standing, leaning\nagainst the rail and looking out over the Shattered Plains. Anyone who\nwatches his patterns would have known where to apply their sabotage.”\n“But sir,” Kaladin said, “it’s just so convoluted. If they have access to\nthe king’s private chambers, then why not hide an assassin inside? Or use\npoison?”\n“Poison is as unlikely to work as this was,” Dalinar said, waving toward\nthe railing. “The king’s food and drink is tasted. As for a hidden assassin,\none might run into guards.” He stood up. “But I agree that such methods\nwould probably have had a greater chance at success. The fact that they\ndidn’t try it that way tells us something. Assuming these are the same\npeople who planted those flawed gemstones in the king’s armor, they prefer\nnonconfrontational methods. It’s not that they’re idiots, they’re…”\n“They’re cowards,” Kaladin realized. “They want to make the\nassassination look like an accident. They’re timid. They may have waited\nthis long so that suspicion would die down.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, rising, looking troubled.\n“This time, though, they made a big mistake.”\n“How?”\nKaladin walked to the cut section he had inspected earlier and knelt\ndown to rub the smooth section. “What cuts iron so cleanly?”\nDalinar leaned down, inspecting the cut, then took out a sphere for more\nlight. He grunted. “It’s supposed to look like the joint came apart, I’d\nguess.”\n“And does it?” Kaladin asked.\n“No. That was a Shardblade.”\n“Narrows down our suspects a tad, I’d think.”\nDalinar nodded. “Don’t tell anyone else. We’ll hide that we noticed the\nShardblade cut, maybe gain an edge. It’s too late to pretend that we think\nthis was an accident, but we don’t have to reveal everything.”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“The king is insisting that I put you in charge of guarding him,” Dalinar\nsaid. “We might have to move up our timetable for that.”\n“I’m not ready,” Kaladin said. “My men are stretched thin with the\nduties they already have.”\n“I know,” Dalinar said softly. He seemed hesitant. “This was done by\nsomeone on the inside, you realize.”\nKaladin felt cold.\n“The king’s own chambers? That means a servant. Or one of his guards.\nMen in the King’s Guard might have had access to his armor, too.” Dalinar\nlooked at Kaladin, face lit by the sphere in his hand. A strong face, with a\nnose that had once been broken. Blunt. Real. “I don’t know whom I can\ntrust these days. Can I trust you, Kaladin Stormblessed?”\n“Yes. I swear it.”\nDalinar nodded. “I’m going to relieve Idrin of this post and assign him"

        "text": "trust these days. Can I trust you, Kaladin Stormblessed?”\n“Yes. I swear it.”\nDalinar nodded. “I’m going to relieve Idrin of this post and assign him\nto a command in my army. It will sate the king, but I’ll make certain Idrin\nknows he isn’t being punished. I suspect he’ll enjoy the new command\nmore anyway.”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“I’ll ask him for his best men,” Dalinar said, “and those will be under\nyour command for now. Use them as little as possible. I eventually want the\nking being guarded only by men from the bridge crews—men you trust,\nmen who have no part in warcamp politics. Choose carefully. I don’t want\nto replace potential traitors with former thieves who can be easily bought.”\n“Yes, sir,” Kaladin said, feeling a large weight settle on his shoulders.\nDalinar stood up. “I don’t know what else to do. A man needs to be able\nto trust his own guards.” He walked back toward the door into the room.\nThe tone of his voice sounded deeply troubled.\n“Sir?” Kaladin asked. “This wasn’t the assassination attempt you were\nexpecting, was it?”\n“No,” Dalinar said, hand on the doorknob. “I agree with your\nassessment. This wasn’t the work of someone who knows what they’re\ndoing. Considering how contrived it was, I’m actually surprised at how\nclose it came to working.” He leveled his gaze at Kaladin. “If Sadeas\ndecides to strike—or, worse, the assassin who claimed my brother’s life—it\nwill not go so well for us. The storm is yet to come.”\nHe pulled open the door, letting out the complaints of the king, which\nhad been muffled behind it. Elhokar was ranting that nobody took his safety\nseriously, that nobody listened, that they should be looking for the things he\nsaw over his shoulder in the mirror, whatever that meant. The tirade\nsounded like the whining of a spoiled child.\nKaladin looked at the twisted rail, imagining the king dangling from it.\nHe had good reason to be out of sorts. But then, wasn’t a king supposed to\nbe better than that? Didn’t his Calling demand that he be able to keep his\ncomposure under pressure? Kaladin found it difficult to imagine Dalinar\nreacting with such ranting, regardless of the situation.\nYour job isn’t to judge, he told himself, waving to Syl and walking away\nfrom the balcony.

A fight for vengeance, a way to\nshow the world that the Alethi don’t stand for betrayal.”\n“Yeah,” Red agreed. The lanky, bearded soldier pulled free a bar from\nher wagon. With this one removed, it left only three at each corner to hold\nup the roof. He dropped the bar with satisfaction, then dusted off his work\ngloves. This would help transform the vehicle from a rolling cage into a\nconveyance more suitable for a lighteyed lady.\n“I remember it,” Red continued, sitting down on the wagon’s bed, legs\ndangling. “The call to arms came to us from Highprince Vamah himself,\nand it moved through Farcoast like a bad stench. Every second man of age\njoined the cause. People wondered if you were a coward if you went to the\npub for a drink but didn’t wear a recruit’s patch. I joined up with five of my\nbuddies. They’re all dead now, rotting in those storm-cursed chasms.”\n“So you just… got tired of fighting?” Shallan asked. She had a desk\nnow. Well, a table—a small piece of travel furniture that could be taken\napart easily. They’d moved it out of the wagon, and she was using it to\nreview some of Jasnah’s notes.\nThe caravan was making camp as the day waned; they’d traveled well\ntoday, but Shallan wasn’t pushing them hard, after what they’d all been\nthrough. After four days of travel, they were approaching the section of the\ncorridor where bandit strikes were much less likely. They were getting close\nto the Shattered Plains, and the safety they offered.\n“Tired of fighting?” Gaz said, chuckling as he took a hinge and began\nnailing it in place. Occasionally, he would glance to the side, a kind of\nnervous tic. “Damnation, no. It wasn’t us, it was the storming lighteyes! No\noffense intended, Brightness. But storm them, and storm them good!”\n“They stopped fighting to win,” Red softly added. “And they started\nfighting for spheres.”\n“Every day,” Gaz said. “Every storming day, we’d get up and fight on\nthose plateaus. And we wouldn’t make any progress. Who cared if we made\nprogress? It was the gemhearts the highprinces were after. And there we\nwere, locked into virtual slavery by our military oaths. No right of travel as\ngood citizens should have, since we’d enlisted. We were dying, bleeding,\nand suffering so they could get rich! That was all. So we left. A bunch of us\nwho drank together, though we served different highprinces. We left them\nand their war behind.”\n“Now, Gaz,” Red said. “That isn’t everything. Be honest with the lady.\nDidn’t you owe some spheres to the debtmongers too? What was that you\ntold us about being one step from being turned into a bridgeman—”\n“Here now,” Gaz said. “That’s my old life. Ain’t nothing in that old life\nthat matters anymore.” He finished with the hammer. “Besides. Brightness\nShallan said our debts would be taken care of.”"

Brightness\nShallan said our debts would be taken care of.”\n“Everything will be forgiven,” Shallan said.\n“See?”\n“Except your breath,” she added.\nGaz looked up, a blush rising on his scarred face, but Red just laughed.\nAfter a moment, Gaz gave in to chuckling. There was something\ndesperately affable about these soldiers. They had seized the chance to live\na normal life again and were determined to hold to it. There hadn’t been a\nsingle problem with discipline in the days they’d been together, and they\nwere quick, even eager, to be of service to her.\nEvidence of that came as Gaz folded the side of her wagon back up—\nthen opened a latch and lowered a small window to let the light in. He\ngestured with a smile at his new window. “Maybe not nice enough to befit a\nlighteyed lady, but at least you’ll be able to see out now.”\n“Not bad,” Red said, clapping slowly. “Why didn’t you tell us you’d\ntrained as a carpenter?”\n“I haven’t trained as one,” Gaz said, expression turning oddly solemn.\n“I spent some time around a lumberyard, that’s all. You pick up a few\nthings.”\n“It’s very nice, Gaz,” Shallan said. “I appreciate it deeply.”\n“It’s nothing. You should probably have one on the other side too. I’ll\nsee if I can scrounge another hinge off the merchants.”\n“Already kissing the feet of our new master, Gaz?” Vathah stepped up to\nthe group. Shallan hadn’t noticed him approaching.\nThe leader of the former deserters held a small bowl of steaming curry\nfrom the dinner cauldron. Shallan could smell the pungent peppers. While it\nwould have made a nice change from the stew she’d eaten with the slavers,\nthe caravan had proper women’s food, which she was obliged to eat. Maybe\nshe could sneak a bite of the curry when nobody was looking.\n“You didn’t ever offer to make things like this for me, Gaz,” Vathah\nsaid, dipping his bread and tearing off a chunk with his teeth. He spoke\nwhile chewing. “You seem happy to have been made a servant to the\nlighteyes again. It’s a wonder your shirt isn’t torn up from all the crawling\nand scraping you’ve been doing.”\nGaz blushed again.\n“So far as I know, Vathah,” Shallan said, “you didn’t have a wagon. So\nwhat is it you’d have wanted Gaz to make a window in? Your head,\nperhaps? I’m certain we can arrange that.”\nVathah smiled as he ate, though it wasn’t a particularly pleasant smile.\n“Did he tell you about the money he owes?”\n“We will handle that problem when the time comes.”\n“This lot is going to be more trouble than you think, little lighteyes,”\nVathah said, shaking his head as he dipped his bread again. “Going right\nback to where they were before.”\n“This time they’ll be heroes for rescuing me.”\nHe snorted. “This lot will never be heroes. They’re crem, Brightness.\nPure and simple.”\nNearby Gaz looked down and Red turned away, but neither disagreed\nwith the assessment."

One would assume you’d be\naccustomed to it by now.”\nHe grunted. “Be careful, girl. You wouldn’t want to accidentally insult a\nman.”\n“The last thing I’d want to do is accidentally insult you, Vathah,”\nShallan said. “To think that I couldn’t manage it on purpose if I wanted!”\nHe looked at her, then flushed and took a moment, trying to come up\nwith a response.\nShallan cut in before he could do so. “I’m not surprised you’re at a loss\nfor words, as it’s also an experience I’m sure you’re accustomed to. You\nmust feel it every time someone asks you a challenging question—such as\nthe color of your shirt.”\n“Cute,” he said. “But words aren’t going to change these men or the\ntroubles they are in.”\n“On the contrary,” Shallan said, meeting his eyes, “in my experience,\nwords are where most change begins.

That terrified her, but she wanted to be ready.\nShe dug out a different book—one of the few from Jasnah’s stash that\ndidn’t describe the Voidbringers or legendary Urithiru. Instead, it listed the\ncurrent Alethi highprinces and discussed their political maneuvers and\ngoals.\nShallan had to be ready. She had to know the political landscape of the\nAlethi court. She couldn’t afford ignorance. She had to know who among\nthese people might be potential allies, if all else failed her.\nWhat of this Sadeas? she thought, flipping to a page in the notebook. It\nlisted him as conniving and dangerous, but noted that both he and his wife\nwere sharp of wit. A man of intelligence might listen to Shallan’s arguments\nand understand them.\nAladar was listed as another highprince that Jasnah respected. Powerful,\nknown for his brilliant political maneuvers. He was also fond of games of\nchance. Perhaps he would risk an expedition to find Urithiru, if Shallan\nhighlighted the potential riches to be found.\nHatham was listed as a man of delicate politics and careful planning.\nAnother potential ally. Jasnah didn’t think much of Thanadal, Bethab, or\nSebarial. The first she called oily, the second a dullard, and the third\noutrageously rude.\nShe studied them and their motivations for some time. Eventually, Gaz\nstood up and dusted sawdust from his trousers. He nodded in respect to her\nand moved to get himself some food.\n“A moment, Master Gaz,” she said.\n“I’m no master,” he said, walking up to her. “Sixth nahn only,\nBrightness. Never could buy myself anything better.”\n“How bad, exactly, are these debts of yours?” she asked, digging some\nspheres out of her safepouch to put in the goblet on her desk.\n“Well, one of the fellows I owed was executed,” Gaz said, rubbing his\nchin. “But there is more.” He hesitated. “Eighty ruby broams, Brightness.\nThough they might not take them anymore. It’s my head they may want,\nthese days.”\n“Quite a debt for a man such as yourself. Are you a gambler, then?”\n“Ain’t no difference,” he said. “Sure.”\n“And that’s a lie,” Shallan said, cocking her head. “I would know the\ntruth from you, Gaz.”\n“Just turn me over to them,” he said, turning and walking toward the\nsoup. “Ain’t no matter. I’d rather that than be out here, wondering when\nthey’ll find me, anyways.”\nShallan watched him go, then shook her head, turning back to her\nstudies. She says that Urithiru is not on the Shattered Plains, Shallan\nthought, turning a few pages. But how is she certain? The Plains were never\nfully explored, because of the chasms. Who knows what is out there?\nFortunately, Jasnah was very complete in her notes. It appeared that\nmost of the old records spoke of Urithiru as being in the mountains.

He liked to come out when\nit was darker, and she did not forbid him. She searched and found him on\nthe table, a complex formation of ridges in the wood.\n“Historians,” Shallan said, “are a bunch of liars.”\n“Mmmmm,” Pattern said, sounding satisfied.\n“That wasn’t a compliment.”\n“Oh.”\nShallan slammed her current book closed. “These women were\nsupposed to be scholars!

No it’s not. Truth is… it’s Truth. Reality.”\n“Your truth is what you see,” Pattern said, sounding confused. “What\nelse could it be? That is the truth that you spoke to me, the truth that brings\npower.”\nShe looked at him, his ridges casting shadows in the light of her\nspheres. She’d renewed those in the highstorm last night, while she was\ncooped up in her box of a wagon. Pattern had started buzzing in the middle\nof the storm—a strange, angry sound. After that, he’d ranted in a language\nshe didn’t understand, panicking Gaz and the other soldiers she’d invited\ninto the shelter. Luckily, they took it for granted that terrible things\nhappened during highstorms, and none had spoken of it since.\nFool, she told herself, flipping to an empty page in the notes. Start\nacting like a scholar. Jasnah would be disappointed. She wrote down what\nPattern had said just now.\n“Pattern,” she said, tapping her pencil—one she’d gotten from the\nmerchants, along with paper. “This table has four legs. Would you not say\nthat is a truth, independent of my perspective?”\nPattern buzzed uncertainly. “What is a leg? Only as it is defined by you.\nWithout a perspective, there is no such thing as a leg, or a table. There is\nonly wood.”\n“You’ve told me the table perceives itself this way.”\n“Because people have considered it, long enough, as being a table,”\nPattern said. “It becomes truth to the table because of the truth the people\ncreate for it.”\nInteresting, Shallan thought, scribbling away at her notebook. She\nwasn’t so interested in the nature of truth at the moment, but in how Pattern\nperceived it. Is this because he’s from the Cognitive Realm? The books say\nthat the Spiritual Realm is a place of pure truth, while the Cognitive is more\nfluid.\n“Spren,” Shallan said. “If people weren’t here, would spren have\nthought?”"

I do not think that my kind would live in a world with only them.\nThey have their own spren.”\nShallan sat up sharply. “Their own spren?”\nPattern shrank on her table, scrunching up, his ridges growing less\ndistinct as they mashed together.\n“Well?” Shallan asked.\n“We do not speak of this.”\n“You might want to start,” Shallan said. “It’s important.”\nPattern buzzed. She thought he was going to insist on the point, but after\na moment, he continued in a very small voice. “Spren are… power…\nshattered power. Power given thought by the perceptions of men. Honor,\nCultivation, and… and another. Fragments broken off.”\n“Another?” Shallan prodded.\nPattern’s buzz became a whine, going so high pitched she almost\ncouldn’t hear it. “Odium.” He spoke the word as if needing to force it out.\nShallan wrote furiously. Odium. Hatred. A type of spren? Perhaps a\nlarge unique one, like Cusicesh from Iri or the Nightwatcher. Hatredspren.\nShe’d never heard of such a thing.\nAs she wrote, one of her slaves approached in the darkening night. The\ntimid man wore a simple tunic and trousers, one of the sets given to Shallan\nby the merchants. The gift was welcome, as the last of Shallan’s spheres\nwere in the goblet before her, and wouldn’t be enough to buy a meal at\nsome of the finer restaurants in Kharbranth.\n“Brightness?” the man asked.\n“Yes, Suna?”\n“I… um…” He pointed. “The other lady, she asked me to tell you…”\nHe was pointing toward the tent used by Tyn, the tall woman who was\nleader of the few remaining caravan guards.\n“She wants me to visit her?” Shallan asked.\n“Yes,” Suna said, looking down. “For food, I guess?”\n“Thank you, Suna,” Shallan said, freeing him to go back toward the fire\nwhere he and the other slaves were helping with the cooking while\nparshmen gathered wood.\nShallan’s slaves were a quiet group. They had tattoos on their foreheads,\nrather than brands. It was the kinder way to do it, and usually marked a\nperson who had entered servitude willingly, as opposed to being forced into\nit as a punishment for a violent or terrible crime. They were men with debts\nor the children of slaves who still bore the debt of their parents.\nThese were accustomed to labor, and seemed frightened by the idea of\nwhat she was paying them.

They were obviously uncomfortable with\nthat idea.\nShallan shook her head, packing away her things. As she walked toward\nTyn’s tent, Shallan paused at the fire and asked Red to lift her table back\ninto the wagon and secure it there.\nShe did worry about her things, but she no longer kept any spheres in\nthere, and had left it open so Red and Gaz could glimpse inside and see\nonly books. Hopefully there would be no incentive for people to go rooting\nthrough them.\nYou dance around the truth too, she thought to herself as she walked\naway from the fire. Just like those historians you were ranting about. She\npretended these men were heroes, but had no illusions about how quickly\nthey could change coats in the wrong circumstances.\nTyn’s tent was large and well lit. The woman didn’t travel like a simple\nguard. In many ways, she was the most intriguing person here. One of the\nfew lighteyes aside from the merchants themselves. A woman who wore a\nsword.\nShallan peeked in through the open flaps and found several parshmen\nsetting up a meal on a low travel table, meant for people to eat at while\nsitting on the floor. The parshmen hurried out, and Shallan watched them\nsuspiciously.\nTyn herself stood by a window cut into the cloth. She wore her long, tan\ncoat, buckled at the waist and almost closed. It had a dresslike feel to it,\nthough it was far stiffer than any dress Shallan had worn, matched by the\nstiff trousers the woman wore underneath.\n“I asked your men,” Tyn said without turning, “and they said you hadn’t\ndined yet. I had the parshmen bring enough for two.”\n“Thank you,” Shallan said, entering and trying to keep the hesitation\nfrom her voice. Among these people, she wasn’t a timid girl but a powerful\nwoman. Theoretically.\n“I’ve ordered my people to keep the perimeter clear,” Tyn said. “We can\nspeak freely.”\n“That is well,” Shallan said.\n“It means,” Tyn said, turning around, “that you can tell me who you\nreally are.”\nStormfather! What did that mean? “I’m Shallan Davar, as I have said.”\n“Yes,” Tyn said, walking over and sitting down at the table. “Please,”\nshe said, gesturing.\nShallan seated herself carefully, using a ladylike posture, with legs bent\nto the side.\nTyn sat cross-legged after flipping her coat out behind her. She dug into\nher meal, dipping flatbread in a curry that seemed too dark—and smelled\ntoo peppery—to be feminine.\n“Men’s food?” Shallan asked.\n“I’ve always hated those definitions,” Tyn said. “I was raised in Tu\nBayla by parents who worked as interpreters. I didn’t realize certain foods\nwere supposed to be for women or men until I visited my parents’ homeland\nfor the first time. Still seems stupid to me. I’ll eat what I want, thank you\nvery much.”\nShallan’s own meal was more proper, smelling sweet rather than savory.\nShe ate, only now realizing how hungry she was."

You hire an intermediary there, and they can\nperform services for you. Research, make inquiries—even relay messages\nfor you via spanreed to any major city in the world. Quite spectacular.”\n“That sounds useful,” Shallan said carefully.\n“Indeed. You can find out all kinds of things. For example, I had my\ncontact find what they could on House Davar. It’s apparently a small, out-\nof-the-way house with large debts and an erratic house leader who may or\nmay not still be alive. He has a daughter, Shallan, whom nobody seems to\nhave met.”\n“I am that daughter,” Shallan said. “So I’d say that ‘nobody’ is a\nstretch.”\n“And why,” Tyn said, “would an unknown scion of a minor Veden\nfamily be traveling the Frostlands with a group of slavers? All the while\nclaiming she’s expected at the Shattered Plains, and that her rescue will be\ncelebrated? That she has powerful connections, enough to pay the salaries\nof a full mercenary troop?”\n“Truth is sometimes more surprising than a lie.”\nTyn smiled, then leaned forward. “It’s all right; you don’t need to keep\nup the front with me. You’re actually doing a good job here. I’ve discarded\nmy annoyance with you and have decided to be impressed instead. You’re\nnew to this, but talented.”\n“This?” Shallan asked.\n“The art of the con, of course,” Tyn said. “The grand act of pretending\nto be someone you aren’t, then running off with the goods. I like what you\npulled with those deserters. It was a big gamble, and it paid off.\n“But now you’re in a predicament. You’re pretending to be someone\nseveral steps above your station, and are promising a grand payoff. I’ve run\nthat scam before, and the trickiest part is the end. If you don’t handle this\nwell, these ‘heroes’ you’ve recruited will have no qualms stringing you up\nby the neck. I’ve noticed that you’re dragging your feet moving us toward\nthe Plains. You’re uncertain, aren’t you? In over your head?”\n“Most definitely,” Shallan said softly.\n“Well,” Tyn said, digging into her food, “I’m here to help.”\n“At what cost?” This woman certainly did like to talk. Shallan was\ninclined to let her continue.\n“I want in on whatever you’re planning,” Tyn said, stabbing her bread\ndown into the bowl like a sword into a greatshell. “You came all the way\nhere to the Frostlands for something. Your plot is likely no small con, but I\ncan’t help but assume you don’t have the experience to pull it off.”\nShallan tapped her finger against the table. Who would she be for this\nwoman? Who did she need to be?\nShe seems like a master con artist, Shallan thought, sweating. I can’t\nfool someone like this.\nExcept that she already had. Accidentally."

Accidentally.\n“How did you end up here?” Shallan asked. “Leading guards on a\ncaravan? Is that part of a con?”\nTyn laughed. “This? No, it wouldn’t be worth the trouble. I may have\nexaggerated my experience in talking to the caravan leaders, but I needed to\nget to the Shattered Plains and didn’t have the resources to do it on my own.\nNot safely.”\n“How does a woman like you end up without resources, though?”\nShallan asked, frowning. “I’d think you would never be without.”\n“I’m not,” Tyn said, gesturing. “As you can plainly see. You’re going to\nhave to get used to rebuilding, if you want to join the profession. It comes,\nit goes. I got stuck down south without any spheres, and am finding my way\nto more civilized countries.”\n“To the Shattered Plains,” Shallan said. “You have a job there of some\nsort as well? A… con you’re intending to pull?”\nTyn smiled. “This isn’t about me, kid. It’s about you, and what I can do\nfor you. I know people in the warcamps. It’s practically the new capital of\nAlethkar; everything interesting in the country is happening there. Money is\nflowing like rivers after a storm, but everyone considers it a frontier, and so\nlaws are lax. A woman can get ahead if she knows the right people.”\nTyn leaned forward, and her expression darkened. “But if she doesn’t,\nshe can make enemies really quickly. Trust me, you want to know who I\nknow, and you want to work with them. Without their approval, nothing big\nhappens at the Shattered Plains. So I ask you again. What are you hoping to\naccomplish there?”\n“I… know something about Dalinar Kholin.”\n“Old Blackthorn himself?” Tyn said, surprised. “He’s been living a\nboring life lately, all superior, like he’s some hero from the legends.”\n“Yes, well, what I know is going to be very important to him. Very.”\n“Well, what is this secret?”\nShallan didn’t answer.\n“Not willing to divulge the goods yet,” Tyn said. “Well, that’s\nunderstandable. Blackmail is a tricky one. You’ll be glad you brought me\non. You are bringing me on, aren’t you?”\n“Yes,” Shallan said. “I do believe I could learn some things from you.”\n25. Monsters\nSmokeform for hiding and slipping between\nmen.\nA form of power, like human Surges.\nBring it ’round again.\nThough crafted of gods,\nIt was by Unmade hand.\nLeaves its force to be but one of foe or friend.\nFrom the Listener Song of Histories, 127th\nstanza\nKaladin figured that it took a lot to put him in a situation he’d never\nbefore seen. He’d been a slave and a surgeon, served on a battlefield and in\na lighteyes’ dining room. He’d seen a lot for his twenty years. Too much, it\nfelt at times. He had many memories he’d rather be without."

        "text": "a lighteyes’ dining room. He’d seen a lot for his twenty years. Too much, it\nfelt at times. He had many memories he’d rather be without.\nRegardless, he had not expected this day to present him with something\nso utterly and disconcertingly unfamiliar. “Sir?” he asked, taking a step\nbackward. “You want me to do what?”\n“Get on that horse,” Dalinar Kholin said, pointing toward an animal\ngrazing nearby. The beast would stand perfectly still, waiting for grass to\ncreep up out of its holes. Then it would pounce, taking a quick bite, which\nwould cause the grass to shoot back down into its burrows. It got a\nmouthful each time, often pulling the grass out by its roots.\nIt was one of many such animals dawdling and prancing through the\narea. It never ceased to stun Kaladin just how rich people like Dalinar were;\neach horse was worth spheres in profusion. And Dalinar wanted him to\nclimb on one of them.\n“Soldier,” Dalinar said, “you need to know how to ride. The time might\ncome when you need to guard my sons on the battlefield. Besides, how long\ndid it take you to reach the palace the other night, when coming to hear\nabout the king’s accident?”\n“Almost three-quarters of an hour,” Kaladin admitted. It had been four\ndays since that night, and Kaladin had frequently found himself on edge\nsince then.\n“I have stables near the barracks,” Dalinar said. “You could have made\nthat trip in a fraction of the time if you could ride. Perhaps you won’t spend\nmuch of your time in the saddle, but this is going to be an important skill\nfor you and your men to know.”\nKaladin looked back at the other members of Bridge Four. Shrugs all\naround—a few timid ones—except for Moash, who nodded eagerly. “I\nsuppose,” Kaladin said, looking back at Dalinar. “If you think it’s\nimportant, sir, we’ll give it a try.”\n“Good man,” Dalinar said. “I’ll send over Jenet, the stablemaster.”\n“We’ll await him with eagerness, sir,” Kaladin said, trying to sound like\nhe meant it.\nTwo of Kaladin’s men escorted Dalinar as he walked toward the stables,\na set of large, sturdy stone buildings. From what Kaladin saw, when the\nhorses weren’t inside, they were allowed to roam freely inside this open\narea west of the warcamp. A low stone wall enclosed it, but surely the\nhorses could jump that at will.\nThey didn’t. The brutes wandered about, stalking grass or lying down,\nsnorting and whinnying. The entire place smelled strange to Kaladin. Not of\ndung, just… of horse. Kaladin eyed one eating nearby, just inside the wall.\nHe didn’t trust it; there was something too smart about horses. Proper\nbeasts of burden like chulls were slow and docile. He’d ride a chull. A\ncreature like this, though… who knew what it was thinking?\nMoash stepped up beside him, watching Dalinar go. “You like him,\ndon’t you?” he asked softly.\n“He’s a good commander,” Kaladin said, as he instinctively sought out\nAdolin and Renarin, who were riding their horses nearby. Apparently, the"

Apparently, the\nthings needed to be exercised periodically to keep them functioning\nproperly. Devilish creatures.\n“Don’t get too close to him, Kal,” Moash said, still watching Dalinar.\n“And don’t trust him too far. He’s lighteyed, remember.”\n“I’m not likely to forget,” Kaladin said dryly. “Besides, you’re the one\nwho looked like you’d faint from joy the moment he offered to let us ride\nthese monsters.”\n“Have you ever faced a lighteyes riding one of these things?” Moash\nasked. “On the battlefield, I mean?”\nKaladin remembered thundering hooves, a man in silvery armor. Dead\nfriends. “Yes.”\n“Then you know the advantage it offers,” Moash said. “I’ll take\nDalinar’s offer gladly.”\nThe stablemaster turned out to be a she. Kaladin raised an eyebrow as\nthe pretty, young lighteyed woman walked up to them, a pair of grooms in\ntow. She wore a traditional Vorin gown, though it wasn’t silk but something\ncoarser, and was slit up the front and back, ankle to thigh. Underneath, she\nwore a feminine pair of trousers.\nThe woman wore her dark hair in a tail, no ornaments, and had a\ntautness to her face that he didn’t expect in a lighteyed woman. “The\nhighprince says I’m to let you ruffians touch my horses,” Jenet said, folding\nher arms. “I’m not pleased about it.”\n“Fortunately,” Kaladin said, “neither are we.”\nShe looked him up and down. “You’re that one, aren’t you? The one\neveryone is talking about?”\n“Maybe.”\nShe sniffed. “You need a haircut. All right, listen up, soldier boys!\nWe’re going to do this properly. I won’t have you hurting my horses, all\nright? You listen, and you listen well.”\nWhat proceeded was one of the dullest, most protracted lectures of\nKaladin’s life. The woman went on and on about posture—straight-backed,\nbut not too tense. About getting the horses to move—nudges with the heels,\nnothing too sharp. About how to ride, how to respect the animal, how to\nhold the reins properly and how to balance. All before being allowed to\neven touch one of the creatures.\nEventually, the boredom was interrupted by the arrival of a man on\nhorseback. Unfortunately, it was Adolin Kholin, riding that white monster\nof a horse of his. It was several hands taller than the one Jenet was showing\nthem. Adolin’s almost looked a completely different species, with those\nmassive hooves, glistening white coat, and unfathomable eyes.\nAdolin looked the bridgemen over with a smirk, then caught the\nstablemaster’s eye and smiled in a less condescending way. “Jenet,” he said.\n“Looking fetching today, as always. Is that a new riding dress?”\nThe woman bent down without looking—she was now talking about\nhow to guide the horses—and selected a stone from the ground. Then she\nturned and threw it at Adolin."

Then she\nturned and threw it at Adolin.\nThe princeling flinched, raising an arm protectively over his face,\nthough Jenet’s aim was off.\n“Oh, come on now,” Adolin said. “You’re not still sore that—”\nAnother rock. This one clipped him on the arm.\n“Right, then,” Adolin said, jogging his horse away, hunched down to\npresent a smaller target for rocks.\nEventually, after demonstrating saddling and bridling on her horse,\nJenet finished the lecture and deemed them worthy of touching some\nhorses. A flock of her grooms, both male and female, scurried out onto the\nfield to select proper mounts for the six bridgemen.\n“Lots of women on your staff,” Kaladin noted to Jenet as the grooms\nworked.\n“Horseback riding isn’t mentioned in Arts and Majesty,” she replied.\n“Horses weren’t terribly well known back then. Radiants had Ryshadium,\nbut even kings had little access to ordinary horses.” She wore her safehand\nin a sleeve, unlike most of the darkeyed groom women, who wore gloves.\n“Which matters because… ?” Kaladin said.\nFrowning, she looked at him, baffled. “Arts and Majesty…” she\nprompted. “Foundation of masculine and feminine arts… Of course. I keep\nlooking at those captain’s knots on your shoulder, but—”\n“But I’m just an ignorant darkeyes?”\n“Sure, if that’s how you want to put it. Whatever. Look, I’m not going to\ngive you a lecture on the arts—I’m tired of talking to you people already.\nLet’s just say that anyone who wants can be a groom, all right?”\nShe lacked a polished refinement that Kaladin had come to expect in\nlighteyed women, and he found it refreshing. Better a woman who was\novertly condescending than the alternative. The grooms walked the horses\nout of their enclosure and to a riding ground, shaped like a ring. A group of\nparshmen with eyes downcast brought the saddles, saddle pads, and bridles\n—equipment that, following Jenet’s lecture, Kaladin could name.\nKaladin selected a beast that didn’t look too evil, a shorter horse with a\nshaggy mane and a brown coat. He saddled it with help from a groom.\nNearby, Moash finished and threw himself up into his saddle. Once the\ngroom let go, Moash’s horse wandered off without him asking it to do so.\n“Hey!” Moash said. “Stop. Whoa. How do I get it to stop walking?”\n“You dropped the reins,” Jenet called after him. “Storming fool! Were\nyou even listening?”\n“Reins,” Moash said, scrambling for them. “Can’t I just slap it over the\nhead with a reed, like you do a chull?”\nJenet rubbed her forehead.\nKaladin looked into the eye of his own chosen beast. “Look,” he said\nsoftly, “you don’t want to do this.

        "text": "pleasant to one another and get it over with as quickly as possible.”\nThe horse snorted softly. Kaladin took a deep breath, then grabbed the\nsaddle as instructed, lifting one foot into the stirrup. He rocked a few times,\nthen threw himself up into the saddle. He grabbed the saddle horn in a death\ngrip and held on tight, ready to be thrown about as the beast went charging\naway.\nHis horse bent her head and began licking some rocks.\n“Hey, now,” Kaladin said, raising the reins. “Come on. Let’s move.”\nThe horse ignored him.\nKaladin tried cuing it in the flanks as he’d been told. The horse didn’t\nbudge.\n“You’re supposed to be some kind of wagon with legs,” Kaladin said to\nthe thing. “You’re worth more than a village. Prove it to me. Get going!\nForward! Onward!”\nThe horse licked the rocks.\nWhat is the thing doing? Kaladin thought, leaning to the side. With\nsurprise, he noticed grass poking out of its holes. Licking fools the grass\ninto thinking rain has come. Often after a storm, plants would unfold to glut\nthemselves on the water even if insects decided to chew them. Clever beast.\nLazy. But clever.\n“You need to show her you’re in charge,” Jenet said, wandering past.\n“Tighten the reins, sit up straight, pull her head up, and don’t let her eat.\nShe’ll walk all over you if you aren’t firm.”\nKaladin tried to obey, and did manage—finally—to pull the horse away\nfrom her meal. The horse did smell odd, but it wasn’t a bad smell really. He\ngot her walking, and once that happened, steering wasn’t that difficult. It\nfelt strange to have some other thing in control of where he was going,\nhowever. Yes, he had the reins, but at any time this horse could just up and\ntake off running and he’d be unable to do anything about it. Half of Jenet’s\ntraining had been about not spooking the horses—about remaining still if\none started to gallop, and about never surprising one from behind.\nIt looked higher from atop the horse than he’d assumed it would. That\nwas a long fall to the ground. He guided the horse about, and after a short\ntime, he managed to pull up beside Natam on purpose. The long-faced\nbridgeman held his reins as if they were precious gemstones, afraid to yank\nthem or direct his horse.\n“Can’t believe people ride these things on storming purpose,” Natam\nsaid. He had a rural Alethi accent, his words bluntly clipped, like he was\nbiting them off before he’d quite finished them. “I mean, we ain’t moving\nany faster than walking, right?”\nAgain, Kaladin remembered the image of that charging mounted\nShardbearer from long ago. Yes, Kaladin could see the reason for horses.\nSitting up higher made it easier to strike with power, and the size of the\nhorse—its bulk and momentum—frightened soldiers on foot and sent them\nscattering.\n“I think most go faster than these,” Kaladin said. “I’d bet they gave us\nthe old horses to practice on.”\n“Yeah, I suppose,” Natam said. “It’s warm.

Hard to feel like\nthis thing is worth as much as it is. It’s like I’m riding about on a pile of\nemerald broams.” He hesitated, glancing backward. “Only, emeralds’\nbacksides ain’t nearly so busy…”\n“Natam,” Kaladin asked. “Do you remember much about the day when\nsomeone tried to kill the king?”\n“Oh, sure,” Natam said. “I was with the guys who ran out there and\nfound him flapping in the wind, like the Stormfather’s own ears.”\nKaladin smiled. Once, this man would barely say two sentences\ntogether, instead always staring at the ground, somber. Used up by his time\nas a bridgeman. These last few weeks had been good for Natam. Good for\nthem all.\n“Before the storm that night,” Kaladin said. “Was anyone out on the\nbalcony? Any servants you didn’t recognize? Any soldiers who weren’t\nfrom the King’s Guard?”\n“No servants that I recall,” Natam said, squinting. The once-farmer got\na pensive look on his face. “I guarded the king all day, sir, with the King’s\nGuard. Ain’t nothing standing out to me. I— Whoa!” His horse had\nsuddenly picked up speed, outpacing Kaladin’s.\n“Think about it!” Kaladin called to him. “See what you can remember!”\nNatam nodded, still holding his reins like they were glass, refusing to\npull them tight or steer the horse. Kaladin shook his head.\nA small horse galloped past him. In the air. Made of light. Syl giggled,\nchanging shape and spinning around as a ribbon of light before settling on\nthe neck of Kaladin’s horse, just in front of him.\nShe lounged back, grinning, then frowned at his expression. “You’re not\nenjoying yourself,” Syl said.\n“You’re starting to sound a lot like my mother.”\n“Captivating?” Syl said. “Amazing, witty, meaningful?”\n“Repetitive.”\n“Captivating?” Syl said. “Amazing, witty, meaningful?”\n“Very funny.”\n“Says the man not laughing,” she replied, folding her arms. “All right,\nso what is drearifying you today?”\n“Drearifying?” Kaladin frowned. “Is that a word?”\n“You don’t know?”\nHe shook his head.\n“Yes,” Syl said solemnly. “Yes, it absolutely is.”\n“Something’s off,” he said. “About the conversation I just had with\nNatam.” He tugged on the reins, stopping the horse from trying to bend\ndown and nibble at grass again. The thing was very focused.\n“What did you talk about?”\n“The assassination attempt,” Kaladin said, narrowing his eyes. “And if\nhe’d seen anyone before the…” He paused. “Before the storm.”\nHe looked down and met Syl’s eyes.\n“The storm itself would have blown down the railing,” Kaladin said.\n“Bending it!” Syl said, standing up and grinning. “Ooohhh…”"

Kaladin turned his horse toward where\nNatam was riding. Unfortunately, catching up wasn’t easy. Natam was\nmoving at a trot, much to his obvious dismay, and Kaladin couldn’t get his\nmount to go faster.\n“Having trouble, bridgeboy?” Adolin asked, trotting up.\nKaladin glanced at the princeling. Stormfather, but it was difficult not to\nfeel tiny when riding beside that monster of Adolin’s. Kaladin tried to kick\nhis horse faster. She kept clopping along at her one speed, walking around\nthe circle here that was a kind of running track for horses.\n“Spray might have been fast during her youth,” Adolin said, nodding at\nKaladin’s mount, “but that was fifteen years ago. I’m surprised she’s still\naround, honestly, but she seems perfectly suited for training children. And\nbridgemen.”\nKaladin ignored him, eyes forward, still trying to get the horse to pick\nup her pace and catch Natam.\n“Now, if you want something with more spunk,” Adolin said, pointing\ntoward the side, “Dreamstorm over there might be more to your liking.”\nHe indicated a larger, leaner animal in its own enclosure, saddled and\nroped to a pole firmly mortared into a hole in the ground. The long rope let\nit run in short bursts, though only around in a circle. It tossed its head,\nsnorting.\nAdolin heeled his own animal forward and past Natam.\nDreamstorm, eh? Kaladin thought, inspecting the creature. It certainly\ndid seem to have more spunk than Spray. It also looked like it wanted to\ntake a bite out of anyone who drew too close.\nKaladin turned Spray in that direction. Once near, he slowed—Spray\nwas all too happy to do that—and climbed off. Doing so proved more\ndifficult than he’d expected, but he managed to avoid tripping onto his face.\nOnce down, he put his hands on his hips and inspected the running\nhorse inside its fence.\n“Weren’t you just complaining,” Syl said, walking up onto Spray’s\nhead, “that you’d rather walk than let a horse carry you about?”\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said. He hadn’t realized it, but he had been holding\nsome Stormlight. Just a tad. It escaped when he spoke, invisible unless he\nlooked closely and detected a slight warping of the air.\n“So what are you doing thinking about riding that?”\n“This horse,” he said, nodding to Spray, “is only for walking. I can walk\njust fine on my own. That other one, that’s an animal for war.” Moash was\nright. Horses were an advantage on the battlefield, so Kaladin should be at\nleast familiar with them.\nThe same argument Zahel made to me about learning to fight against a"

Horses were an advantage on the battlefield, so Kaladin should be at\nleast familiar with them.\nThe same argument Zahel made to me about learning to fight against a\nShardblade, Kaladin thought with discomfort. And I turned him down.\n“What do you think you’re doing?” Jenet asked, riding up to him.\n“I’m going to get on that,” Kaladin said, pointing at Dreamstorm.\nJenet snorted. “She’ll throw you in a heartbeat and you’ll break your\ncrown, bridgeman. She’s not good with riders.”\n“She has a saddle on.”\n“So she can get used to wearing one.”\nThe horse finished a round of cantering and slowed.\n“I don’t like that look in your eyes,” Jenet told him, turning her own\nanimal to the side. It stomped impatiently, as if eager to be running.\n“I’m going to give it a try,” Kaladin said, walking forward.\n“You won’t even be able to get on,” Jenet said. She watched him\ncarefully, as if curious what he’d do—though it seemed to him she might be\nmore worried for the horse’s safety than his.\nSyl alighted on Kaladin’s shoulder as he walked.\n“This is going to be like back at the lighteyed practice grounds, isn’t it?”\nKaladin asked. “I’m going to end up on my back, staring at the sky, feeling\nlike a fool.”\n“Probably,” Syl said lightly. “So why are you doing this? Because of\nAdolin?”\n“Nah,” Kaladin said. “The princeling can storm away.”\n“Then why?”\n“Because I’m scared of these things.”\nSyl looked at him, seeming baffled, but it made perfect sense to\nKaladin. Ahead, Dreamstorm—huffing out huge breaths from her run—\nlooked at him. She met his eyes.\n“Storms!” Adolin’s voice called from behind. “Bridgeboy, don’t actually\ndo it! Are you mad?”\nKaladin stepped up to the horse. She danced a few steps back, but let\nhim touch the saddle. So he breathed in a little more Stormlight and threw\nhimself at the saddle.\n“Damnation! What—” Adolin shouted.\nThat was all Kaladin heard. His Stormlight-aided leap let him get higher\nthan an ordinary man could probably have managed, but his aim was off.\nHe got hold of the pommel and threw one leg over, but the horse started\nthrashing.\nThe beast was incredibly strong, a distinct and powerful contrast to\nSpray. Kaladin was quite nearly hurled from the seat on the first buck.\nWith a wild swipe of the hand, Kaladin poured Stormlight onto the\nsaddle and stuck himself in place. That only meant that instead of being\ntossed from horseback like a limp cloth, he got whipped back and forth like\na limp cloth. He somehow managed to get hold of the horse’s mane and,\nwith teeth gritted, did his best to keep from being bounced senseless.\nThe stable grounds were a blur. The only sounds he could hear were his\nbeating heart and the smashing hooves. The Voidbringer beast moved like a\nstorm itself, but Kaladin was stuck to the saddle as surely as if he’d been"

After what seemed an eternity, the horse—blowing out big,\nfrothy breaths—stilled.\nKaladin’s swimming vision cleared to show a group of bridgemen—\nkeeping their distance—cheering him on. Adolin and Jenet, both mounted,\nstared at him with what seemed to be a mixture of horror and awe. Kaladin\ngrinned.\nThen, in one last, powerful motion, Dreamstorm bucked him free.\nHe hadn’t realized that the Stormlight in the saddle was exhausted. In a\nfitting fulfillment of his earlier prediction, Kaladin found himself dazed,\nlying on his back staring at the sky, having trouble remembering the last\nfew seconds of his life. A number of painspren wiggled out of the ground\nbeside him, little orange hands that grabbed this way and that.\nAn equine head with unfathomably dark eyes leaned down over\nKaladin. The horse snorted at him. The smell was moist and grassy.\n“You monster,” Kaladin said. “You waited until I was relaxed, then\nthrew me.”\nThe horse snorted again, and Kaladin found himself laughing. Storms,\nbut that had felt good! He couldn’t explain why, but the act of clinging for\ndear life to the thrashing animal had been truly exhilarating.\nAs Kaladin stood and dusted himself off, Dalinar himself broke through\nthe crowd, brow furrowed. Kaladin hadn’t realized the highprince had still\nbeen nearby. He looked from Dreamstorm to Kaladin, then raised an\neyebrow.\n“You don’t chase down assassins on a placid mount, sir,” Kaladin said,\nsaluting.\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, “but it is customary to start training men by using\nweapons without edges, soldier. Are you all right?”\n“Fine, sir,” Kaladin said.\n“Well, it seems your men are taking to the training,” Dalinar said. “I’m\ngoing to put in a requisition release. You and five others you select are to\ncome here and practice every day for the next few weeks.”\n“Yes, sir.” He’d find the time. Somehow.\n“Good,” Dalinar said. “I received your proposal for initial patrols\noutside of the warcamps, and thought it looked good. Why don’t you start\nin two weeks, and bring some horses with you to practice out in the field.”\nJenet made a strangled sound. “Outside the city, Brightlord? But…\nbandits…”\n“The horses are here to be used, Jenet,” Dalinar said. “Captain, you’ll\nbe sure to bring enough troops to protect the horses, won’t you?”\n“Yes, sir,” Kaladin said.\n“Good. But do leave that one behind,” Dalinar said, waving toward\nDreamstorm.\n“Er, yes, sir.”\nDalinar nodded, moving off and raising his hand toward someone\nKaladin couldn’t see.

Kaladin found himself\nstanding near Adolin, who remained mounted.\n“Thanks,” Adolin said, grudgingly.\n“For?” Kaladin asked, walking past him toward Spray, who continued\nto chew at grass, uncaring of the fuss.\n“Not telling Father I put you up to that.”\n“I’m not an idiot, Adolin,” Kaladin said, swinging into his saddle. “I\ncould see what I was getting myself into.” He turned his horse away from\nher meal with some difficulty, and got some more pointers from a groom.\nEventually, Kaladin trotted over toward Natam again. The gait was\nbouncy, but he mostly got the hang of moving with the horse—they called it\nposting—to keep from slapping around too much.\nNatam watched him as he moved up. “That’s unfair, sir.”\n“What I did with Dreamstorm?”\n“No. The way you just ride like that. Seems so natural for you.”\nDidn’t feel that way. “I want to talk some more about that night.”\n“Sir?” the long-faced man asked. “I haven’t thought of anything yet.\nBeen a little distracted.”\n“I have another question,” Kaladin said, bringing their horses up beside\none another. “I asked you about your shift during the day, but what about\nright after I left? Did anyone other than the king go out onto the balcony?”\n“Just guards, sir,” Natam said.\n“Tell me which ones,” Kaladin said. “Maybe they saw something.”\nNatam shrugged. “I mainly watched the door. The king remained in the\nsitting room for a time. I guess Moash went out.”\n“Moash,” Kaladin said, frowning. “Wasn’t his shift supposed to be done\nsoon?”\n“Yeah,” Natam said. “He stayed around a little extra time; said he\nwanted to see the king settled. While waiting, Moash went out to watch the\nbalcony. You usually want one of us out there.”\n“Thanks,” Kaladin said. “I’ll ask him.”\nKaladin found Moash diligently listening to Jenet explain something.\nMoash seemed to have picked up riding quickly—he seemed to pick up\neverything quickly. Certainly, he’d been the best student among the\nbridgemen when it came to fighting.\nKaladin watched him for a few moments, frowning. Then it struck him.\nWhat are you thinking? That Moash might have had something to do with\nthe assassination attempt? Don’t be stupid. That was ridiculous. Besides,\nthe man didn’t have a Shardblade.\nKaladin turned his horse away. As he did, however, he saw the person\nDalinar had gone to meet. Brightlord Amaram. The two were too far away\nfor Kaladin to hear them, but he could see the amusement on Dalinar’s face.\nAdolin and Renarin rode up to them, smiling broadly as Amaram waved to\nthem.\nThe anger that surged within Kaladin—sudden, passionate, almost\nchokingly strong—made him clench his fists. His breath hissed out. That\nsurprised him. He’d thought the hatred buried deeper than that."

The Feather\nThey blame our people\nFor the loss of that land.\nThe city that once covered it\nDid range the eastern strand.\nThe power made known in the tomes of our\nclan\nOur gods were not who shattered these\nplains.\nFrom the Listener Song of Wars, 55th\nstanza\nAdolin crashed into the Parshendi line, ignoring weapons, throwing his\nshoulder against the enemy at the front. The Parshendi man grunted, his\nsong faltering, as Adolin spun about himself and swept with his Shardblade.\nTugs on the weapon marked when it passed through flesh.\nAdolin came out of his spin, ignoring the glow of Stormlight coming\nfrom a crack at his shoulder. Around him, bodies dropped, eyes burning in\ntheir skulls. Adolin’s breath, hot and humid, filled his helm as he puffed in\nand out.\nThere, he thought, raising his Blade and charging, his men filling in\naround him. Not those bridgemen, for once, but real soldiers. He’d left the\nbridgemen back on the assault plateau. He didn’t want men around him who\ndidn’t want to fight Parshendi.\nAdolin and his soldiers pushed through the Parshendi, joining up with a\nfrantic set of soldiers in green uniforms with gold accents, led by a\nShardbearer in matching colors. The man fought with a large Shardbearer’s\nhammer—he had no Blade of his own.\nAdolin pushed through to him. “Jakamav?” he asked. “You all right?”\n“All right?” Jakamav asked, voice muffled by his helm. He slammed the\nfaceplate up, revealing a grin. “I’m wonderful.” He laughed, pale green\neyes alight with the Thrill of the fight. Adolin recognized that feeling well.\n“You were almost surrounded!” Adolin said, turning to face a group of\nParshendi running up in pairs. Adolin respected them for coming at\nShardbearers, rather than fleeing. It meant almost certain death, but if you\nwon, you could turn the tide of a battle.\nJakamav laughed, sounding as pleased now as when enjoying a\nwinehouse singer, and that laughter was infectious. Adolin found himself\ngrinning as he engaged the Parshendi, sweeping them down with blow after\nblow. He never enjoyed simple warfare as much as a good duel, but for the\nmoment, despite its crassness, he found challenge and joy in the fight.\nMoments later, the dead lying at his feet, he spun about and searched for\nanother challenge. This plateau was shaped very strangely; it had been a tall\nhill before the Plains were shattered, but half of it had ended up on the\nadjacent plateau. He couldn’t imagine what kind of force would have split\nthe hill down the center, as opposed to cracking it at the base.\nWell, it wasn’t an ordinary-shaped hill, so maybe that had something to\ndo with the split.

        "text": "Well, it wasn’t an ordinary-shaped hill, so maybe that had something to\ndo with the split. It was shaped more like a wide, flat pyramid with only\nthree steps. A large base, a second plateau atop it that was perhaps a\nhundred feet across, then a third, smaller peak atop the other two, placed\nright in the center. Almost like a cake with three tiers that had been cut with\na large knife right down the center.\nAdolin and Jakamav fought on the second tier of the battlefield.\nTechnically, Adolin wasn’t required to be on this run. It wasn’t his army’s\nturn in the rotation. However, the time had come to implement another part\nof Dalinar’s plan. Adolin had arrived with only a small strike force, but it\nwas a good thing he had. Jakamav had been surrounded up here, on the\nsecond tier, and the regular army hadn’t been able to break through.\nNow, the Parshendi had been pushed back to the sides of this tier. They\nstill held the top tier completely; it was where the chrysalis had appeared.\nThat put them in a bad position. Yes, they had the high ground, but they also\nhad to hold the slopes between tiers to secure their withdrawal. They’d\nobviously hoped to get the harvesting done before the humans arrived.\nAdolin kicked a Parshendi soldier over the edge, toppling him down\nthirty feet or so onto those fighting on the bottom tier, then looked to his\nright. The slope upward was there, but the Parshendi had the approach\nclogged. He’d really like to reach the top…\nHe looked at the sheer cliff face between his tier and the one above.\n“Jakamav,” he called, pointing.\nJakamav followed Adolin’s gesture, looking upward. Then stepped back\nfrom the fighting.\n“That’s crazy!” Jakamav said as Adolin jogged up.\n“Sure is.”\n“Let’s be at it, then!” He handed his hammer to Adolin, who slipped it\ninto the sheath on his friend’s back. Then the two of them ran to the rock\nwall and started to climb.\nAdolin’s Plated fingers ground against rock as he pulled himself straight\nup. Soldiers below cheered them on. There were handholds aplenty, though\nhe would never have wanted to do this without Plate to propel his climb and\nprotect him if he fell.\nIt was still crazy; they’d end up surrounded. However, two Shardbearers\ncould do amazing things when supporting one another. Besides, if they got\noverwhelmed, they could always jump off the cliff, assuming their Plate\nwas healthy enough to survive the fall.\nIt was the sort of risky move that Adolin would never dare when his\nfather was on the battlefield.\nHe paused halfway up the cliff. Parshendi gathered on the edge of the\ntier above, preparing for them.\n“You have a plan for getting a foothold up there?” Jakamav asked,\nclinging to the rocks beside Adolin.\nAdolin nodded. “Just be ready to support me.”\n“Sure.” Jakamav scanned the heights, face hidden behind his helm.\n“What are you doing here, by the way?”\n“I figured no army would turn away some Shardbearers who wanted to\nhelp.”\n“Shardbearers? Plural?”\n“Renarin is down below.”\n“Hopefully not fighting.”"

Plural?”\n“Renarin is down below.”\n“Hopefully not fighting.”\n“He’s surrounded by a large squad of soldiers with careful instructions\nnot to let him get into the fighting. Father wanted him to see a few of these,\nthough.”\n“I know what Dalinar is doing,” Jakamav said. “He’s trying to show a\nspirit of cooperation, trying to get the highprinces to stop being rivals. So he\nsends his Shardbearers to help, even when the run isn’t his.”\n“Are you complaining?”\n“Nope. Let’s see you make an opening up there. I’ll need a moment to\nget the hammer out.”\nAdolin grinned inside his helmet, then continued climbing. Jakamav\nwas a landlord and Shardbearer under Highprince Roion, and a fairly good\nfriend. It was important that lighteyes like Jakamav saw Dalinar and Adolin\nactively working toward a better Alethkar. Perhaps a few episodes like this\nwould show the value of a trustworthy alliance, instead of the backstabbing,\ntemporary coalition Sadeas represented.\nAdolin climbed farther, Jakamav close behind, until he was a dozen feet\nfrom the top. The Parshendi clustered there, hammers and maces at the\nready—weapons for fighting a man in Shardplate. A few farther down\nlaunched arrows, which bounced ineffectively off the Plate.\nAll right, Adolin thought, holding his hand to the side—clinging to the\nrocks with the other—and summoned his Blade. He slammed it directly into\nthe rock wall with the flat of the blade facing upward. He climbed up beside\nthe sword.\nThen he stepped onto the flat of the blade.\nShardblades couldn’t break—they could barely bend—so it held him.\nHe suddenly had leverage and good footing, and so when he crouched down\nand leaped, the Plate hurled him upward. As he passed the edge of the top\ntier, he grabbed the rock there—just beneath the feet of the Parshendi—and\npulled on it to throw himself into the waiting foe.\nThey broke off their singing as he smashed into them with the force of a\nboulder. He got his feet underneath him, mentally sending a summons to his\nBlade, then slammed his shoulder into one group. He began to lay about\nhimself with punches, smashing the chest of one Parshendi, then the head of\nanother. The soldiers’ carapace armor cracked with sickening sounds, and\nthe punches flung them backward, knocking some off the cliff.\nAdolin took a few hits on his forearms before his Blade finally re-\nformed in his hands. He swung about, so focused on holding his ground that\nhe didn’t notice Jakamav until the Shardbearer in green fell in beside him,\ncrushing Parshendi with his hammer.\n“Thanks for tossing a platoon’s worth of Parshendi down on my head,”\nJakamav called as he swung. “That was a wonderful surprise.”\nAdolin grinned, pointing. “Chrysalis.”\nThe top tier wasn’t well populated—though more Parshendi were\nflooding up the incline.

He and Jakamav had a direct path to the chrysalis, a\nhulking, oblong boulder of brown and faint green. It was matted to the\nrocks with the same stuff that made up its shell.\nAdolin leaped over the twitching form of a Parshendi with dead legs\nand charged the chrysalis, Jakamav following at a clanking jog. Getting to a\ngemheart was tough—the chrysalises had skin like rock—but with a\nShardblade, it could be easy. They just had to kill the thing, then cut a hole\nso they could rip out the heart and—\nThe chrysalis was already open.\n“No!” Adolin said, scrambling up to it, grabbing the sides of the hole\nand peering into the slushy violet interior. Chunks of carapace floated\nwithin the goop, and a conspicuous gap lay where the gemheart normally\nconnected to veins and sinew.\nAdolin spun, searching across the top of the plateau. Jakamav clanked\nup and cursed. “How did they get it out so quickly?”\nThere. Nearby, Parshendi soldiers scattered, yelling in their\nimpenetrable, rhythmic language. Standing behind them was a tall figure in\nsilvery Shardplate, a red cloak billowing out behind. The armor had peaked\njoints, ridges rising like the points on a crab’s shell. The figure was easily\nseven feet tall, the armor making him look massive, perhaps because it\ncovered a Parshendi who had that carapace armor growing from his skin.\n“It’s him!” Adolin said, running forward. This was the one his father\nhad fought on the Tower, the only Shardbearer they’d seen among the\nParshendi for weeks, maybe months.\nPerhaps the last one they had.\nThe Shardbearer turned toward Adolin, gripping a large uncut gemstone\nin his hand. It dripped ichor and plasma.\n“Fight me!” Adolin said.\nA group of Parshendi soldiers charged past the Shardbearer, running\ntoward the long drop-off at the back of the formation, where the hill had\nbeen split down the center. The Shardbearer handed his gemheart to one of\nthese charging men, then turned and watched them jump.\nThey soared across the gap to land on the top of the other half of the\nhill, the one on the adjacent plateau. It still amazed Adolin that these\nParshendi soldiers could leap chasms. He felt a fool as he realized that these\nheights were not a trap for them as they would be for humans. To them, a\nmountain split in half was just another chasm to leap.\nMore and more of the Parshendi made the leap, flowing away from the\nhumans below and jumping to safety. Adolin did spot one who stumbled as\nhe leapt. The poor fellow screamed as he plummeted into the chasm. This\nwas dangerous for them, but it was obviously less so than trying to fight off\nthe humans.\nThe Shardbearer remained. Adolin ignored the fleeing Parshendi—\nignored Jakamav, who called for him to fall back—and ran up to that\nShardbearer, swinging his Blade full force. The Parshendi raised his own\nBlade, slapping aside Adolin’s blow."

The words were in Alethi—heavily accented, yes,\nbut understandable.\nThe Shardbearer slammed up his faceplate. And, to Adolin’s shock,\nthere was no beard on that face. Didn’t that make this a woman? Telling the\ndifference with Parshendi was difficult for him. The vocal timbre was rough\nand low-pitched, though he supposed it could be feminine.\n“I must need speak to Dalinar,” the woman said, stepping forward. “I\nmet him one time, much long ago.”\n“You refused our every messenger,” Adolin said, backing away, sword\nout. “Now you wish to speak with us?”\n“That was long ago. Time does change.”\nStormfather. Something inside of Adolin urged him to go in swinging,\nto batter this Shardbearer down and get some answers, win some Shards.\nFight!

It could change the course of the entire war.\n“He will want to contact you,” Adolin said, taking a deep breath,\nshoving down the Thrill of battle. “How?”\n“Will send messenger,” the Shardbearer said. “Do not kill one who\ncomes.” She raised her Shardblade toward him in salute, then let it drop and\ndematerialize. She turned to charge toward the chasm and hurled herself\nacross in a prodigious leap.\n* * *\nAdolin pulled off his helm as he strode across the plateau.

It wasn’t\noften that a run ended with the Alethi controlling the plateau, but with no\ngemheart to show for it.\nHe released one gauntlet, the straps undoing themselves automatically\nat his will, then hooked it at his waist.

Sir, we\ntried hard to dissuade him. Then, when he got near and summoned his\nBlade, he just kind of… stood there. We got him away, sir, but he’s been\nsitting on that rock ever since.”\nOne of Renarin’s fits. “Thank you, soldier,” Adolin said. He walked\nback over and laid his ungauntleted hand on Renarin’s shoulder. “It’s all\nright, Renarin. It happens.”\nRenarin shrugged again. Well, if he was in one of his moods, there was\nnothing to do but let him stew. The younger man would talk about it when\nhe was ready.\nAdolin organized his two hundred troops, then paid his respects to the\nhighprinces. Neither seemed very grateful. In fact, Ruthar seemed\nconvinced that Adolin and Jakamav’s stunt had driven the Parshendi off\nwith the gemheart. As if they wouldn’t have withdrawn the moment they\nhad it anyway. Idiot.\nAdolin smiled affably, regardless. Hopefully Father was right, and the\nextended hand of fellowship would help. Personally, Adolin just wanted a\nchance at each of them in the dueling ring, where he could teach them a\nlittle respect.\nOn his way back to his army, he searched out Jakamav, who sat under a\nsmall pavilion, having a cup of wine as he watched the rest of his army\ntrudge back across the bridges. There were a lot of slumped shoulders and\nlong faces.\nJakamav gestured for his steward to get Adolin a cup of sparkling\nyellow wine. Adolin took it in his unarmored hand, though he didn’t drink.\n“That was quite nearly awesome,” Jakamav said, staring out at the battle\nplateau. From this lower vantage, it looked truly imposing, with those three\ntiers.\nAlmost looks man-made, Adolin thought idly, considering the shape.\n“Nearly,” Adolin agreed. “Can you imagine what an assault would look like\nif we had twenty or thirty Shardbearers on the battlefield at once? What\nchance would the Parshendi have?”\nJakamav grunted. “Your father and the king are seriously committed to\nthis course, aren’t they?”\n“As am I.”\n“I can see what you and your father are doing here, Adolin. But if you\nkeep dueling, you’re going to lose your Shards. Even you can’t always win.\nEventually you’ll hit an off day. Then it will all be gone.”\n“I might lose at some point,” Adolin agreed. “Of course by then I’ll\nhave won half the Shards in the kingdom, so I should be able to arrange a\nreplacement.”\nJakamav sipped his wine, smiling. “You are a cocky bastard, I’ll give\nyou that.”\nAdolin smiled, then settled down in a squat beside Jakamav’s chair—he\ncouldn’t sit in one himself, not in Shardplate—so he could meet his friend’s\neyes. “The truth is, Jakamav, I’m not really worried about losing my Shards"

I can’t seem to\nget any Shardbearers to agree to a bout, at least not for Shards.”\n“There have been certain… inducements going around,” Jakamav\nadmitted. “Promises made to Shardbearers if they refused you.”\n“Sadeas.”\nJakamav inspected his wine. “Try Eranniv. He’s been boasting that he’s\nbetter than the standings give him credit for. Knowing him, he’ll see\neveryone else refusing, and see it as an opportunity for him to do something\nspectacular. He’s pretty good, though.”\n“So am I,” Adolin said. “Thanks, Jak. I owe you.”\n“What’s this I hear about you being betrothed?”\nStorms. How had that gotten out? “It’s just a causal,” Adolin said. “And\nit might not even get that far. The woman’s ship seems to have been\nseverely delayed.”\nTwo weeks now, with no word. Even Aunt Navani was getting worried.\nJasnah should have sent word.\n“I never thought you were the type to let yourself be nailed into an\narranged marriage, Adolin,” Jakamav said. “There are lots of winds to ride\nout there, you know?”\n“Like I said,” Adolin replied, “it’s far from official.”\nHe still didn’t know how he felt about all this. Part of him had wanted to\npush back simply because he resisted being subject to Jasnah’s\nmanipulation. But then, his recent track record wasn’t anything to boast of.\nAfter what had happened with Danlan… It wasn’t his fault, was it, that he\nwas a friendly man? Why did every woman have to be so jealous?\nThe idea of letting someone else just take care of it all for him was more\ntempting than he’d ever publicly admit.\n“I can tell you the details,” Adolin said. “Maybe at the winehouse later\ntonight? Bring Inkima? You can tell me how stupid I’m being, give me\nsome perspective.”\nJakamav stared at his wine.\n“What?” Adolin asked.\n“Being seen with you isn’t good for one’s reputation these days,\nAdolin,” Jakamav said. “Your father and the king aren’t particularly\npopular.”\n“It will all blow over.”\n“I’m sure it will,” Jakamav said. “So let’s… wait until then, shall we?”\nAdolin blinked, the words hitting him harder than any blow on the\nbattlefield. “Sure,” Adolin forced himself to say.\n“Good man.” Jakamav actually had the audacity to smile at him and lift\nhis cup of wine.\nAdolin set aside his own cup untouched and stalked off.\nSureblood was ready and waiting for him when he reached his men.\nAdolin moved to swing into the saddle, stewing, but the white Ryshadium\nnudged him with a butt of the head. Adolin sighed, scratching at the horse’s\nears. “Sorry,” he said. “Haven’t been paying much attention to you lately,\nhave I?”\nHe gave the horse a good scratch, and felt somewhat better after"

Adolin patted Sureblood’s neck, and the horse\npranced a bit as they started moving. He often did that when Adolin was\nfeeling annoyed, as if trying to improve his master’s mood.\nHis four guards for the day followed behind him. They’d obligingly\nbrought their old bridge from Sadeas’s army to get Adolin’s team where\nthey needed to go. They seemed to find it very amusing that Adolin had his\nsoldiers take shifts carrying the thing.\nStorming Jakamav. This has been coming, Adolin admitted to himself.\nThe more you defend Father, the more they’ll pull away. They were like\nchildren. Father really was right.\nDid Adolin have any true friends? Anyone who would actually stand by\nhim when things were difficult? He knew practically everyone of note in the\nwarcamps. Everyone knew him.\nHow many of them actually cared?\n“I didn’t have a fit,” Renarin said softly.\nAdolin shook out of his brooding. They rode side by side, though\nAdolin’s mount was several hands taller. With Adolin astride a Ryshadium,\nRenarin looked like a child on a pony by comparison, even in his Plate.\nClouds had rolled across the sun, giving some relief from the glare,\nthough the air had turned cold lately and it looked like winter was here for a\nseason. The empty plateaus stretched ahead, barren and broken.\n“I just stood there,” Renarin said. “I wasn’t frozen because of my…\nailment. I’m just a coward.”\n“You’re no coward,” Adolin said. “I’ve seen you act as brave as any\nman. Remember the chasmfiend hunt?”\nRenarin shrugged.\n“You don’t know how to fight, Renarin,” Adolin said. “It’s a good thing\nyou froze. You’re too new at this to go into battle right now.”\n“I shouldn’t be. You started training when you were six.”\n“That’s different.”\n“You’re different, you mean,” Renarin said, eyes forward. He wasn’t\nwearing his spectacles. Why was that? Didn’t he need them?\nTrying to act like he doesn’t, Adolin thought. Renarin so desperately\nwanted to be useful on a battlefield. He’d resisted all suggestions that he\nshould become an ardent and pursue scholarship, as might have better\nsuited him.\n“You just need more training,” Adolin said. “Zahel will whip you into\nshape. Just give it time. You’ll see.”\n“I need to be ready,” Renarin said. “Something is coming.”\nThe way he said it gave Adolin a shiver. “You’re talking about the\nnumbers on the walls.”\nRenarin nodded. They’d found another scratched set of them, after the\nrecent highstorm, outside Father’s room. Forty-nine days. A new storm\ncomes.\nAccording to the guards, nobody had gone in or out—different men\nfrom last time, which made it unlikely it had been one of them. Storms.\nThat had been scratched on the wall while Adolin had been sleeping just\none room away. Who, or what, had done it?"

Who, or what, had done it?\n“Need to be ready,” Renarin said. “For the coming storm. So little\ntime…”\n27. Fabrications to Distract\nFIVE YEARS AGO\nShallan longed to stay outside. Here in the gardens, people didn’t\nscream at each other. Here there was peace.\nUnfortunately, it was a fake peace—a peace of carefully planted\nshalebark and cultivated vines. A fabrication, designed to amuse and\ndistract. More and more she longed to escape and visit places where the\nplants weren’t carefully trimmed into shapes, where people didn’t step\nlightly, as if afraid of causing a rockslide. A place away from the shouting.\nA cool mountain breeze came down from the heights and swept through\nthe gardens, making vines shy backward. She sat away from the\nflowerbeds, and the sneezing they would bring her, instead studying a\nsection of sturdy shalebark. The cremling she sketched turned at the wind,\nits enormous feelers twitching, before leaning back down to chew on the\nshalebark. There were so many kinds of cremlings. Had anyone tried to\ncount them all?\nBy luck, her father had owned a drawing book—one of the works of\nDandos the Oilsworn—and she used that for instruction, letting it rest open\nbeside her.\nA yell sounded from inside the nearby manor house. Shallan’s hand\nstiffened, making an errant streak across her sketch. She took a deep breath\nand tried to return to her drawing, but another series of shouts put her on\nedge. She set her pencil down.\nShe was nearly out of sheets from the latest stack her brother had\nbrought her. He returned unpredictably but never for long, and when he\ncame, he and Father avoided one another.\nNobody in the manor knew where Helaran went when he left.\nShe lost track of time, staring at a blank sheet of paper. That happened\nto her sometimes. When she raised her eyes, the sky was darkening. Almost\ntime for Father’s feast. He had those regularly now.\nShallan packed up her things in the satchel, then took off her sun hat\nand walked toward the manor house. Tall and imposing, the building was an\nexemplar of the Veden ideal. Solitary, strong, towering. A work of square\nblocks and small windows, dappled by dark lichen. Some books called\nmanors like this the soul of Jah Keved—isolated estates, each brightlord\nruling independently. It seemed to her that those writers romanticized rural\nlife. Had they ever actually visited one of the manors, experienced the true\ndullness of country life in person, or did they merely fantasize about it from\nthe comfort of their cosmopolitan cities?\nInside the house, Shallan turned up the stairs toward her quarters. Father\nwould want her looking nice for the feast. There would be a new dress for\nher to wear as she sat quietly, not interrupting the discussion. Father had\nnever said so, but she suspected he thought it a pity she had begun speaking\nagain.\nPerhaps he did not wish her to be able to speak of things she’d seen. She"

She\nstopped in the hallway, her mind going blank.\n“Shallan?”\nShe shook herself to find Van Jushu, her fourth brother, on the steps\nbehind her. How long had she been standing and staring at the wall? The\nfeast would start soon!\nJushu’s jacket was undone and hung askew, his hair mussed, his cheeks\nflushed with wine. No cufflinks or belt; they had been fine pieces, each with\na glowing gemstone. He’d have gambled those away.\n“What was Father yelling about earlier?” she asked. “Were you here?”\n“No,” Jushu said, running his hand through his hair. “But I heard. Balat\nhas been starting fires again. Nearly burned down the storming servants’\nbuilding.” Jushu pushed past her, then stumbled, grabbing the bannister to\nkeep from falling.\nFather was not going to like Jushu coming to the feast like this. More\nyelling.\n“Storms-cursed idiot,” Jushu said as Shallan helped him right himself.\n“Balat is going straight crazy. I’m the only one left in this family with any\nsense. You were staring at the wall again, weren’t you?”\nShe didn’t reply.\n“He’ll have a new dress for you,” Jushu said as she helped him toward\nhis room. “And nothing for me but curses. Bastard. He loved Helaran, and\nnone of us are him, so we don’t matter. Helaran is never here! He betrayed\nFather, almost killed him. And still, he’s the only one who matters…”\nThey passed Father’s chambers. The heavy stumpweight door was open\na crack as a maid tidied the room, allowing Shallan to see the far wall.\nAnd the glowing strongbox.\nIt was hidden behind a painting of a storm at sea that did nothing to dim\nthe powerful white glow. Right through the canvas, she saw the outline of\nthe strongbox blazing like a fire. She stumbled, pulling to a stop.\n“What are you staring at?” Jushu demanded, holding to the bannister.\n“The light.”\n“What light?”\n“Behind the painting.”\nHe squinted, lurching forward. “What in the Halls are you talking about,\ngirl? It really did ruin your mind, didn’t it? Watching him kill Mother?”\nJushu pulled away from her, cursing softly to himself. “I’m the only one in\nthis family who hasn’t gone crazy. The only storming one…”\nShallan stared into that light. There hid a monster.\nThere hid Mother’s soul.\n28.

I’ll check each one.”\nTyn laughed, tossing her head back, jet-black hair falling free around\nher shoulders. She sat in the driver’s seat of the wagon. Where Bluth used\nto sit.\n“You call that a Bav accent?” Tyn demanded.\n“I’ve only heard them three or four times.”\n“You sounded like you have rocks in your mouth!”\n“That’s how they sound!”\n“Nah, it’s more like they have pebbles in their mouths. But they talk\nreally slow, with overemphasized sounds. Like this. ‘Oi looked over the\npaintings that ya gave me, and they’re roit nice. Roit nice indeed. Ain’t\nnever had a cloth for my backside that was so pleasant.’”\n“You’re exaggerating that!” Shallan said, though she couldn’t help\nlaughing.\n“A tad,” Tyn said, leaning back and sweeping her long, chull-guiding\nreed in front of her like a Shardblade.\n“I don’t see why knowing a Bav accent would be useful,” Shallan said.\n“They’re not a very important people.”\n“Kid, that’s why they’re important.”\n“They’re important because they’re unimportant,” Shallan said. “All\nright, I know I’m bad at logic sometimes, but something about that\nstatement seems off.”\nTyn smiled. She was so relaxed, so… free. Not at all what Shallan had\nexpected after their first encounter.\nBut then the woman had been playing a part. Leader of the guard. This\nwoman Shallan was talking to now, this seemed real.\n“Look,” Tyn said, “if you’re going to fool people, you’ll need to learn\nhow to act beneath them as well as above them. You’re getting the whole\n‘important lighteyes’ thing down. I assume you’ve had good examples.”\n“You could say that,” Shallan replied, thinking of Jasnah.\n“Thing is, in a lot of situations, being an important lighteyes is useless.”\n“Being unimportant is important. Being important is useless. Got it.”\nTyn eyed her, chewing on some jerky. Her sword belt hung from a peg\non the side of the seat, swaying to the rhythm of the chull’s gait. “You\nknow, kid, you get kind of mouthy when you let your mask down.”\nShallan blushed.\n“I like it. I prefer people who can laugh at life.”\n“I can guess what you’re trying to teach me,” Shallan said. “You’re\nsaying that a person with a Bav accent, someone who looks lowly and\nsimple, can go places a lighteyes never could.”\n“And can hear or do things a lighteyes never could. Accent is important.\nElocute with distinction, and it often won’t matter how little money you\nhave. Wipe your nose on your arm and speak like a Bav, and sometimes\npeople won’t even glance to see if you’re wearing a sword.”\n“But my eyes are light blue,” Shallan said. “I’ll never pass for lowly, no\nmatter what my voice sounds like!”\nTyn fished in her trouser pocket.

She had slung her coat over another\npeg, and so wore only the pale tan trousers—tight, with high boots—and a\nbuttoned shirt. Almost a worker’s shirt, though of nicer material.\n“Here,” Tyn said, tossing something to her.\nShallan barely caught it. She blushed at her clumsiness, then held it up\ntoward the sun: a small vial with some dark liquid inside.\n“Eyedrops,” Tyn said. “They’ll darken your eyes for a few hours.”\n“Really?”\n“Not hard to find, if you have the right connections. Useful stuff.”\nShallan lowered the vial, suddenly feeling a chill. “Is there—”\n“The reverse?” Tyn cut in. “Something to turn a darkeyes into a\nlighteyes? Not that I know of. Unless you believe the stories about\nShardblades.”\n“Makes sense,” Shallan said, relaxing. “You can darken glass by\npainting it, but I don’t think you can lighten it without melting down the\nwhole thing.”\n“Anyway,” Tyn said, “you’ll need a good backwater accent or two.\nHerdazian, Bavlander, something like that.”\n“I probably have a rural Veden accent,” Shallan admitted.\n“That won’t work out here. Jah Keved is a cultured country, and your\ninternal accents are too similar to one another for outsiders to recognize.\nAlethi won’t hear rural from you, like a fellow Veden would. They’ll just\nhear exotic.”\n“You’ve been to a lot of places, haven’t you?” Shallan asked.\n“I go wherever the winds take me. It’s a good life, so long as you’re not\nattached to stuff.”\n“Stuff?” Shallan asked. “But you’re—pardon—you’re a thief. That’s all\nabout getting more stuff!”\n“I take what I can get, but that just proves how transient stuff is. You’ll\ntake some things, but then you’ll lose them. Just like the job I pulled down\nsouth. My team never returned from their mission; I’m half convinced they\nran off without seeing me paid.” She shrugged. “It happens. No need to get\nworked up.”\n“What kind of job was it?” Shallan asked, blinking pointedly to take a\nMemory of Tyn lounging there, sweeping her reed as if conducting\nmusicians, not a care in the world. They’d nearly died a couple of weeks\nback, but Tyn took it in stride.\n“It was a big job,” Tyn said. “Important, for the kinds of people who\nmake things change in the world. I still haven’t heard back from the ones\nwho hired us. Maybe my men didn’t run off; maybe they just failed. I don’t\nknow for certain.” Here, Shallan caught tension in Tyn’s face. A tightening\nof the skin around the eyes, a distance to her gaze. She was worried about\nwhat her employers might do to her. Then it was gone, smoothed away.\n“Have a look,” Tyn said, nodding up ahead.\nShallan followed the gesture and noticed moving figures a few hills\nover.

        "text": "Shallan followed the gesture and noticed moving figures a few hills\nover. The landscape had slowly changed as they approached the Plains. The\nhills grew steeper, but the air a little warmer, and plant life was more\nprevalent. Stands of trees clustered in some of the valleys, where waters\nwould flow after highstorms. The trees were squat, different from the\nflowing majesty of the ones she’d known in Jah Keved, but it was still nice\nto see something other than scrub.\nThe grass here was fuller. It pulled smartly away from the wagons,\nsinking into its burrows. The rockbuds here grew large, and shalebark\ncropped up in patches, often with lifespren bouncing about like tiny green\nmotes. During their days traveling they’d passed other caravans, more\nplentiful now that they were closer to the Shattered Plains. So Shallan\nwasn’t surprised to see someone up ahead. The figures, however, rode\nhorses. Who could afford animals like that? And why didn’t they have an\nescort? There seemed to be only four of them.\nThe caravan rolled to a stop as Macob yelled an order from the first\nwagon. Shallan had learned, through awful experience, just how dangerous\nany encounter out here could be. None were taken lightly by caravan\nmasters. She was the authority here, but she allowed those with more\nexperience to call stops and choose their path.\n“Come on,” Tyn said, stopping the chull with a whack of the stick, then\nhopping down from the wagon and grabbing her coat and sword off their\npegs.\nShallan scrambled down, putting on her Jasnah face. She let herself be\nherself with Tyn. With the others, she needed to be a leader. Stiff, stern, but\nhopefully inspiring. To that end, she was pleased with the blue dress that\nMacob had given her. Embroidered with silver, made of the finest silk, it\nwas a wonderful upgrade from her tattered one.\nThey walked past where Vathah and his men marched just behind the\nlead wagon. The leader of the deserters shot Tyn a glare. His dislike of the\nwoman was only more reason to respect her, despite her criminal\nproclivities.\n“Brightness Davar and I will handle this,” Tyn said to Macob as they\npassed.\n“Brightness?” Macob said, standing and looking toward Shallan. “What\nif they are bandits?”\n“There are only four of them, Master Macob,” Shallan said lightly. “The\nday I can’t handle four bandits on my own is a day I deserve to be robbed.”\nThey passed the wagon, Tyn tying on her belt.\n“What if they are bandits?” Shallan hissed once they were out of\nearshot.\n“I thought you said you could handle four.”\n“I was just going along with your attitude!”\n“That’s dangerous, kid,” Tyn said with a grin. “Look, bandits wouldn’t\nlet us see them, and they certainly wouldn’t just sit there.”\nThe group of four men waited on the top of the hill. As Shallan drew\ncloser, she could see that they were wearing crisp blue uniforms that looked\nquite genuine. At the bottom of the ravine between hills, Shallan stubbed\nher toe on a rockbud.

They were luxurious, and probably worth a fortune, but\nthey were little more than slippers.\n“We’ll wait here,” Shallan said. “They can come to us.”\n“Sounds good to me,” Tyn said. Indeed, up above, the men started\nmoving down the hillside when they noticed Shallan and Tyn were waiting\nfor them. Two more came and followed after them on foot, men not in\nuniforms, but workers’ clothing. Grooms?\n“Who are you going to be?” Tyn asked softly.\n“… Myself?” Shallan replied.\n“What’s the fun in that?” Tyn said. “How’s your Horneater?”\n“Horneater! I—”\n“Too late,” Tyn said as the men rode up.\nShallan found horses intimidating. The large brutish things weren’t\ndocile like chulls. Horses were always stomping about, snorting.\nThe lead rider reined in his horse with some obvious annoyance. He\ndidn’t seem in complete control of the beast. “Brightness,” he said, nodding\nto her as he saw her eyes. Shockingly, he was darkeyed, a tall man with\nblack Alethi hair he wore down to his shoulders. He looked over Tyn,\nnoting the sword and the soldier’s uniform, but let slip no reaction. A hard\nman, this one.\n“Her Highness,” Tyn announced in a loud voice, gesturing toward\nShallan, “Princess Unulukuak’kina’autu’atai! You are in the presence of\nroyalty, darkeyes!”\n“A Horneater?” the man said, leaning down, inspecting Shallan’s red\nhair. “Wearing a Vorin dress. Rock would have a fit.”\nTyn looked to Shallan and raised an eyebrow.\nI’m going to strangle you, woman, Shallan thought, then took a deep\nbreath. “This thing,” Shallan said, gesturing at her dress. “He is not what\nyou have a princess wear? He is good for me. You will be respect!”\nFortunately, her red face would fit for a Horneater. They were a passionate\npeople.\nTyn nodded to her, looking appreciative.\n“I’m sorry,” the man said, though he didn’t seem very apologetic. What\nwas a darkeyes doing riding an animal of such value? One of the man’s\ncompanions was inspecting the caravan through a spyglass. He was\ndarkeyed too, but looked more comfortable on his mount.\n“Seven wagons, Kal,” the man said. “Well guarded.”\nThe man, Kal, nodded. “I’ve been sent out to look for signs of bandits,”\nhe said to Tyn. “Has all been well with your caravan?”\n“We ran into some bandits three weeks ago,” Tyn said, thumbing over\nher shoulder. “Why do you care?”\n“We represent the king,” the man said. “And are from the personal\nguard of Dalinar Kholin.”\nOh, storms.

If you really were\nattacked, I would like to know the details.”\n“If we were attacked?” Shallan asked. “You doubt our word?”\n“No—”\n“I am offend!” Shallan declared, folding her arms.\n“You’d better watch yourself,” Tyn told the men. “Her Highness does\nnot like to be offended.”\n“How surprising,” Kal said. “Where did the attack take place? You\nfought it off? How many bandits were there?”\nTyn filled him in on the details, which gave Shallan a chance to think.\nDalinar Kholin was her future father-in-law, if the causal matured into a\nmarriage. Hopefully, she wouldn’t run into these particular soldiers again.\nI really am going to strangle you, Tyn…\nTheir leader listened to the details of the attack with a stoic air. He\ndidn’t seem like a very pleasant man.\n“I am sorry to hear of your losses,” Kal said. “But you’re only a day and\na half by caravan from the Shattered Plains now. You should be safe the rest\nof the way.”\n“I am curiosity,” Shallan said. “These animals, they are horses? Yet you\nare darkeyed. This… Kholin trusts you well.”\n“I do my duty,” Kal said, studying her. “Where are the rest of your\npeople? That caravan looks as if it’s all Vorin. Also, you look a little spindly\nfor a Horneater.”\n“Did you just insult the princess’s weight?” Tyn asked, aghast.\nStorms! She was good. She actually managed to produce angerspren\nwith the remark.\nWell, nothing to do but soldier on.\n“I am offend!” Shallan yelled.\n“You have offended Her Highness again!”\n“Very offend!”\n“You’d better apologize.”\n“No apologize!” Shallan declared. “Boots!”\nKal leaned back, looking between the two of them, trying to parse what\nhad just been said. “Boots?” he asked.\n“Yes,” Shallan said. “I am liking your boots. You will apology with\nboots.”\n“You… want my boots?”\n“Did you not hear Her Highness?” Tyn asked, arms folded. “Are\nsoldiers of this Dalinar Kholin’s army so disrespectful?”\n“I’m not disrespectful,” Kal said. “But I’m not giving her my boots.”\n“You insult!” Shallan declared, stepping forward, pointing at him.\nStormfather, those horses were enormous! “I will tell all who are to listen!\nWhen arriving, I will say, ‘Kholin is stealer of boots and taker of women’s\nvirtue!’”\nKal sputtered. “Virtue!”\n“Yes,” Shallan said; then she glanced over to Tyn. “Virtue? No, wrong\nword. Virture… No… Vesture. Vesture! Taker of woman’s vesture! That is\nword I wanted.”\nThe soldier glanced to his companions, looking confused. Drat, Shallan\nthought. Good puns are lost on men with poor vocabulary."

        "text": "word I wanted.”\nThe soldier glanced to his companions, looking confused. Drat, Shallan\nthought. Good puns are lost on men with poor vocabulary.\n“Is no matter,” Shallan said, throwing up her hand. “All will know what\nyou have done in wronging me. You have laid me bare, here in this\nwilderness. Stripping me! Is an insult to my house and my clan. All will\nknow that Kholin—”\n“Oh, stop, stop,” Kal said, reaching down and awkwardly pulling his\nboot from his foot while on horseback. His sock had a hole in the heel.\n“Storming woman,” he muttered. He tossed the first boot down to her, then\nremoved the other.\n“Your apology is accepted,” Tyn said, fetching the boots.\n“By Damnation, it had better be,” Kal said. “I’ll pass along your story.\nMaybe we can get this storming place patrolled. Come on, men.” He turned\nand left them without another word, perhaps fearing another Horneater\ndiatribe.\nOnce they were out of earshot, Shallan looked at the boots, then started\nlaughing uncontrollably. Joyspren rose around her, like blue leaves that\nstarted at her feet then moved up in a swirl before flaring out above her as if\nin a blast of wind. Shallan watched them with a big smile. Those were very\nrare.\n“Ah,” Tyn said with a smile. “No use denying. That was fun.”\n“I’m still going to strangle you,” Shallan said. “He knew we were\nplaying with him. That has to be the worst Horneater impression a woman\nhas ever done.”\n“It was actually pretty good,” Tyn said. “You overdid the words, but the\naccent itself was spot on. That wasn’t the point, though.” She handed back\nthe boots.\n“What was the point?” Shallan asked as they hiked back toward the\ncaravan. “Making a fool out of me?”\n“Partially,” Tyn said.\n“That was sarcasm.”\n“If you’re going to learn to do this,” Tyn said, “you have to be\ncomfortable in situations like that. You can’t be embarrassed when you pose\nas someone else. The more outrageous the attempt, the straighter you have\nto play it. The only way to get better is to practice—and in front of people\nwho very well might catch you.”\n“I suppose,” Shallan said.\n“Those boots are too big for you,” Tyn noted. “Though I did love the\nlook on his face when you asked for them. ‘No apologize. Boots!’”\n“I really need some boots,” Shallan said. “I’m tired of walking around\non rock barefoot or in slippers. A little padding, and these will fit.” She held\nthem up. They were rather large. “Er, maybe.” She looked backward. “I\nhope he’ll be all right without them. What if he has to fight bandits on his\nway back?”\nTyn rolled her eyes. “We’re going to have to talk about that\nkindheartedness of yours sometime, kid.”\n“It’s not a bad thing to be nice.”\n“You’re training to be a con artist,” Tyn said. “For now, let’s get back to\nthe caravan.

With that red hair of yours, you’ll probably find more chances to use\nit than you would others.”\n29. Rule of Blood\nArtform for colors beyond our ken;\nFor its grand songs we yearn.\nWe must attract creationspren;\nThese songs suffice ’til we learn.\nFrom the Listener Song of Revision, 279th\nstanza\nTorol Sadeas closed his eyes and rested Oathbringer on his shoulder,\nbreathing in the sweet, moldy scent of Parshendi blood. The Thrill of battle\nsurged within him, a blessed and beautiful strength.\nHis own blood pumped so loudly in his ears he almost couldn’t hear the\nbattlefield shouts and groans of pain. For a moment, he reveled only in the\ndelicious glow of the Thrill, the heady euphoria at having spent an hour\nengaged in the only thing that brought true joy anymore: contending for his\nlife, and taking those of enemies lesser than himself.\nIt faded. As always, the Thrill was fleeting once battle itself ended. It\nhad grown less and less sweet during these raids on the Parshendi, likely\nbecause he knew deep inside that this contest was pointless. It did not\nstretch him, did not carry him further toward his ultimate goals of conquest.\nSlaughtering crem-covered savages in a Heralds-forsaken land had truly\nlost its savor.\nHe sighed, lowering his Blade, opening his eyes. Amaram approached\nacross the battlefield, stepping over corpses of men and Parshendi. His\nShardplate was bloodied purple up to the elbows, and he carried a\nglimmering gemheart in one gauntleted hand. He kicked aside a Parshendi\ncorpse and joined Sadeas, his own honor guard fanning out to join those of\nhis highprince. Sadeas spared a moment of annoyance for how efficiently\nthey moved, particularly when compared to his own men.\nAmaram pulled off his helm and hefted the gemheart, tossing it up and\ncatching it. “Your maneuver here today failed, you realize?”\n“Failed?” Sadeas said, lifting his faceplate. Nearby, his soldiers\nslaughtered a pocket of fifty Parshendi who hadn’t managed to get off the\nplateau when the rest retreated. “I think this went quite nicely.”\nAmaram pointed. A stain had appeared on the plateaus to the west,\ntoward the warcamps. The banners indicated that Hatham and Roion, the\ntwo highprinces who were supposed to have gone on this plateau run, had\narrived together—they used bridges like Dalinar’s, slow plodding things it\nhad been easy to outrun. One of the advantages of the bridge crews Sadeas\npreferred was that they needed very little training to function. If Dalinar had\nthought to slow him down with his stunt of trading Oathbringer for Sadeas’s\nbridgemen, he had been proven a fool.\n“We needed to get out here,” Amaram said, “seize the gemheart, and\nreturn before the others arrived. Then you could have claimed that you\ndidn’t realize you weren’t in the rotation today. The arrival of both other"

        "text": "return before the others arrived. Then you could have claimed that you\ndidn’t realize you weren’t in the rotation today. The arrival of both other\narmies removes that shred of deniability.”\n“You mistake me,” Sadeas said. “You assume I still care about\ndeniability.” The last Parshendi died with enraged screams; Sadeas felt\nproud of that. Others said Parshendi warriors on the field never surrendered,\nbut he’d seen them try it once, long ago, in the first year of the war. They’d\nlaid down their weapons. He’d slaughtered them all personally, with\nShardhammer and Plate, beneath the eyes of their retreating companions\nwatching from a nearby plateau.\nNever again had any Parshendi denied him or his men their right to\nfinish a battle the proper way. Sadeas waved for the vanguard to gather and\nescort him back to the warcamps while the rest of the army licked its\nwounds. Amaram joined him, crossing a bridge and passing idling\nbridgemen who lay on the ground and slept while better men died.\n“I am duty-bound to join you on the battlefield, Your Highness,”\nAmaram said as they walked, “but I want you to know that I do not approve\nof our actions here. We should be seeking to bridge our differences with the\nking and Dalinar, not trying to agitate them further.”\nSadeas snorted. “Don’t give me that noble talk. It works fine for others,\nbut I know you for the ruthless bastard you really are.”\nAmaram set his jaw, eyes forward. When they reached their horses, he\nreached out, hand on Sadeas’s arm. “Torol,” he said softly, “there is so\nmuch more to the world than your squabbles. You’re right about me, of\ncourse. Take that admission with the understanding that to you, above all\nothers, I can speak the truth. Alethkar needs to be strong for what is\ncoming.”\nSadeas climbed the mounting block the groom had set out. Getting onto\na horse in Shardplate could be dangerous to the animal if not done correctly.\nBesides, he’d once had a stirrup snap on him when he stepped into it to haul\nhimself into the saddle. He’d ended up on his backside.\n“Alethkar does need to be strong,” Sadeas said, holding out a gauntleted\nhand. “So I’ll make it so by force of fist and the rule of blood.”\nAmaram reluctantly placed the gemheart there, and Sadeas gripped it,\nholding his reins in the other hand.\n“Do you ever worry?” Amaram asked. “About what you do? About\nwhat we must do?” He nodded toward a group of surgeons, carrying\nwounded men across the bridges.\n“Worry?” Sadeas said. “Why should I? It gives the wretches a chance to\ndie in battle for something worthwhile.”\n“You say things like that a lot these days, I’ve noticed,” Amaram said.\n“You weren’t like that before.”\n“I’ve learned to accept the world as it is, Amaram,” Sadeas said, turning\nhis horse. “That’s something very few people are willing to do. They\nstumble along, hoping, dreaming, pretending. That doesn’t change a single"

You have to stare the world in the eyes, in all its\ngrimy brutality. You have to acknowledge its depravities. Live with them.\nIt’s the only way to accomplish anything meaningful.”\nWith a squeeze of the knees, Sadeas started his horse forward, leaving\nAmaram behind for the moment.\nThe man would remain loyal. Sadeas and Amaram had an\nunderstanding. Even Amaram now being a Shardbearer would not change\nthat.\nAs Sadeas and his vanguard approached Hatham’s army, he noticed a\ngroup of Parshendi on a nearby plateau, watching. Those scouts of theirs\nwere getting bold. He sent a team of archers to go chase them off, then rode\ntoward a figure in resplendent Shardplate at the front of Hatham’s army: the\nhighprince himself, seated upon a Ryshadium. Damnation. Those animals\nwere far superior to any other horseflesh. How to get one?\n“Sadeas?” Hatham called out to him. “What have you done here?”\nAfter a quick moment of decision, Sadeas lifted his arm back and hurled\nthe gemheart across the plateau separating them. It hit the rock near Hatham\nand bounced along in a roll, glowing faintly.\n“I was bored,” Sadeas shouted back. “I thought I’d save you some\ntrouble.”\nThen, ignoring further questions, Sadeas continued on his way. Adolin\nKholin had a duel today, and he’d decided not to miss it, just in case the\nyouth embarrassed himself again.\n* * *\nA few hours later, Sadeas settled down into his place in the dueling\narena, tugging at the stock on his neck. Insufferable things—fashionable,\nbut insufferable. He would never tell a soul, not even Ialai, that he secretly\nwished he could just go about in a simple uniform like Dalinar.\nHe couldn’t ever do that, of course. Not just because he wouldn’t be\nseen bowing to the Codes and the king’s authority, but because a military\nuniform was actually the wrong uniform for these days. The battles they\nfought for Alethkar at the moment weren’t battles with sword and shield.\nIt was important to dress the part when you had a role to play. Dalinar’s\nmilitary outfits proved he was lost, that he didn’t understand the game he\nwas playing.\nSadeas leaned back to wait as whispers filled the arena like water in a\nbowl. A large attendance today. Adolin’s stunt in his previous duel had\ndrawn attention, and anything novel was of interest to the court. Sadeas’s\nseat had a space cleared around it to give him extra room and privacy,\nthough it was really just a simple chair built onto the stone bleachers of this\npit of an arena.\nHe hated how his body felt outside of Shardplate, and he hated more\nhow he looked. Once, he’d turned heads as he walked. His power had filled\na room; everyone had looked to him, and many had lusted when seeing him.\nLusted for his power, for who he was."

His power had filled\na room; everyone had looked to him, and many had lusted when seeing him.\nLusted for his power, for who he was.\nHe was losing that. Oh, he was still powerful—perhaps more so. But the\nlook in their eyes was different. And every way of responding to his loss of\nyouthfulness made him look petulant.\nHe was dying, step by step. Like every man, true, but he felt that death\nlooming. Decades away, hopefully, but it cast a long, long shadow. The only\npath to immortality was through conquest.\nRustling cloth announced Ialai slipping into the seat beside his. Sadeas\nreached out absently, resting his hand on the small of her back and\nscratching at that place she liked. Her name was symmetrical. A tiny bit of\nblasphemy from her parents—some people dared imply such holiness of\ntheir children. Sadeas liked those types. Indeed, the name was what had first\nintrigued him about her.\n“Mmmm,” his wife said with a sigh. “Very nice. The duel hasn’t started\nyet, I see.”\n“Mere moments away, I believe.”\n“Good. I can’t stand waiting. I hear you gave away the gemheart you\ncaptured today.”\n“Threw it at Hatham’s feet and rode away, as if I didn’t have a care.”\n“Clever. I should have seen that as an option. You’ll undermine\nDalinar’s claim that we only resist him because of our greed.”\nBelow, Adolin finally stepped out onto the field, wearing his blue\nShardplate. Some of the lighteyes clapped politely. Across the way, Eranniv\nleft his own preparatory room, his polished Plate its natural color except\nacross the breastplate, which he’d painted a deep black.\nSadeas narrowed his eyes, still scratching Ialai’s back. “This duel\nshould not even be happening,” he said. “Everyone was supposed to be too\nafraid, or too dismissive, to accept his challenges.”\n“Idiots,” Ialai said softly. “They know, Torol, what they’re supposed to\ndo—I’ve dropped the right hints and promises. And yet every one of them\nsecretly wants to be the man who brings down Adolin. Duelists are not a\nparticularly dependable lot. They are brash, hotheaded, and care too much\nabout showing off and gaining renown.”\n“His father’s plan cannot be allowed to work,” Sadeas said.\n“It won’t.”\nSadeas glanced at where Dalinar had set up. Sadeas’s own position was\nnot too far away—within shouting distance. Dalinar didn’t look at him.\n“I built this kingdom,” Sadeas said softly. “I know how fragile it is,\nIalai. It should not be so difficult to knock the thing down.” That would be\nthe only way to properly build it anew. Like reforging a weapon. You\nmelted down the remnants of the old before you created the replacement.\nThe duel began down below, Adolin striding across the sands toward\nEranniv, who wielded old Gavilar’s Blade, with its wicked design. Adolin\nengaged too quickly. Was the boy that eager?"

Was the boy that eager?\nIn the crowd, lighteyes grew quiet and darkeyes shouted, eager for\nanother display like last time. However, this didn’t devolve into a wrestling\nmatch. The two exchanged testing blows and Adolin backed away, having\ntaken a hit on his shoulder.\nSloppy, Sadeas thought.\n“I finally discovered the nature of that disturbance at the king’s\nchambers two weeks ago,” Ialai noted.\nSadeas smiled, eyes still on the bout. “Of course you did.”\n“Assassination attempt,” she said. “Someone sabotaged the king’s\nbalcony in a crude attempt at dropping him a hundred feet to the rocks.\nFrom what I hear, it nearly worked.”\n“Not so crude then, if it almost killed him.”\n“Pardon, Torol, but almost is a big distinction in assassinations.”\nTrue.\nSadeas searched within himself, seeking some sign of emotion at\nhearing that Elhokar had almost died. He found none beside a faint sense of\npity. He was fond of the boy, but to rebuild Alethkar, all vestiges of former\nrule would need to be removed. Elhokar would need to die. Preferably in a\nquiet manner, after Dalinar had been dealt with. Sadeas expected he’d have\nto cut the boy’s throat himself, out of respect for old Gavilar.\n“Who commissioned the assassins, do you suppose?” Sadeas asked,\nspeaking softly enough that—with the buffer his guards kept around their\nseats—he didn’t have to worry about being overheard.\n“Hard to tell,” Ialai replied, scooting to the side and twisting to get him\nto scratch a different part of her back. “It wouldn’t be Ruthar or Aladar.”\nBoth were solidly in Sadeas’s palm. Aladar with some resignation,\nRuthar eagerly. Roion was too much a coward, others too careful. Who else\ncould have done it?\n“Thanadal,” Sadeas guessed.\n“He’s the most likely. But I will see what I can discover.”\n“It might be the same ones as with the king’s armor,” Sadeas said.\n“Perhaps we could find out more if I exercise my authority.”\nSadeas was Highprince of Information—one of the old designations,\nfrom previous centuries, which split duties in the kingdom among\nhighprinces. It technically gave Sadeas authority over investigations and\npolicing.\n“Perhaps,” Ialai said hesitantly.\n“But?”\nShe shook her head, watching another exchange of the duelists down\nbelow. This bout of fighting left Adolin with Stormlight streaming from one\ngauntlet, to the booing of some of the darkeyes. Why were those people\neven allowed in? There were lighteyes who were unable to attend because\nElhokar reserved seating for their inferiors.\n“Dalinar,” Ialai said, “has responded to our ploy of making you\nHighprince of Information. He used it as precedent for making himself\nHighprince of War. And so now, every step you take invoking your rights as"

        "text": "Highprince of Information. He used it as precedent for making himself\nHighprince of War. And so now, every step you take invoking your rights as\nHighprince of Information cements his authority over this conflict.”\nSadeas nodded. “You have a plan, then?”\n“Not quite yet,” Ialai said. “But I’m forming one. You’ve noticed how\nhe started up patrols outside of the camps? And in the Outer Market. Should\nthat be your duty?”\n“No, that’s the job of a Highprince of Commerce, which the king hasn’t\nappointed. However, I should have authority over policing all ten camps,\nand appointing judges and magistrates. He should have involved me the\nmoment an attempt was made on the king’s life. But he didn’t.” Sadeas\nchewed on the thought for a moment, removing his hand from Ialai’s back,\nletting her sit up straight.\n“There is a weakness here we can exploit,” Sadeas said. “Dalinar has\nalways had a problem giving up authority. He never really trusts anyone to\ndo their job. He didn’t come to me when he should have. This weakens his\nclaims that all parts of the kingdom should work together. It’s a chink in his\narmor. Can you ram a dagger in it?”\nIalai nodded. She’d use her informants to start questions in court: Why,\nif Dalinar was trying to forge a better Alethkar, was he unwilling to give up\nany power? Why hadn’t he involved Sadeas in the king’s protection? Why\nwouldn’t he open his doors to Sadeas’s judges?\nWhat authority did the Throne have, really, if it made assignments like\nthe one to Sadeas, only to pretend they hadn’t been given?\n“You should renounce your appointment as Highprince of Information\nin protest,” Ialai said.\n“No. Not yet. We wait until the rumors have nipped at old Dalinar, made\nhim decide he needs to let me do my job. Then, the moment before he tries\nto involve me, I renounce.”\nIt would widen the cracks that way, both in Dalinar, and in the kingdom\nitself.\nAdolin’s bout continued below. He certainly didn’t look like his heart\nwas in it. He kept leaving himself open, taking hits. This was the youth who\nhad bragged about his skill so often? He was good, of course, but not nearly\nthat good. Not as good as Sadeas had himself seen when the boy had been\non the battlefield fighting the…\nHe was faking.\nSadeas found himself grinning. “Now that’s almost clever,” he said\nsoftly.\n“What?” Ialai asked.\n“Adolin is fighting beneath his capacity,” Sadeas explained as the youth\ngot a hit—barely—on Eranniv’s helm. “He’s reluctant to display his real\nskill, as he fears it will scare others away from dueling him. If he looks\nbarely capable enough to win this fight, others might decide to pounce.”\nIalai narrowed her eyes, watching the fight. “Are you sure? Couldn’t he\njust be having an off day?”\n“I’m sure,” Sadeas said. Now that he knew what to watch for, he could\neasily read it in Adolin’s specific moves, the way he teased Eranniv to"

Now that he knew what to watch for, he could\neasily read it in Adolin’s specific moves, the way he teased Eranniv to\nattack him, then barely fended off the blows. Adolin Kholin was cleverer\nthan Sadeas had given him credit for.\nBetter at dueling as well. It took skill to win a bout—but it took true\nmastery to win while making it look the whole time that you were behind.\nAs the fight progressed, the crowd got into it, and Adolin made it a close\ncontest. Sadeas doubted many others would see what he did.\nWhen Adolin, moving lethargically and leaking Light from a dozen hits\n—all carefully allowed on different sections of Plate, so none shattered and\nexposed him to real danger—managed to bring down Eranniv with a\n“lucky” blow at the end, the crowd roared in appreciation. Even the\nlighteyes seemed drawn in.\nEranniv stormed off, shouting about Adolin’s luck, but Sadeas found\nhimself quite impressed. There might be a future for this boy, he thought.\nMore so than his father, at least.\n“Another Shard won,” Ialai said with dissatisfaction as Adolin raised a\nhand and walked off the field. “I’ll redouble my efforts to make certain this\ndoesn’t happen again.”\nSadeas tapped his finger against the side of his seat. “What was it you\nsaid about duelists? That they’re brash? Hotheaded?”\n“Yes. And?”\n“Adolin is both of those things and more,” Sadeas said softly,\nconsidering. “He can be goaded, pushed around, brought to anger. He has\npassion like his father, but he controls it less securely.”\nCan I get him right up to the cliff’s edge, Sadeas thought, then shove\nhim off?\n“Stop discouraging people from fighting him,” Sadeas said. “Don’t\nencourage them to fight him, either. Step back. I want to see how this\ndevelops.”\n“That sounds dangerous,” Ialai said. “That boy is a weapon, Torol.”\n“True,” Sadeas said, standing, “but you are rarely cut by a weapon if\nyou are the one holding its hilt.” He helped his wife to her feet. “I also want\nyou to tell Ruthar’s wife that he can ride with me next time I decide to\nstrike out on my own for a gemheart. Ruthar is eager. He can be of use to\nus.”\nShe nodded, walking toward the exit. Sadeas followed, but hesitated,\ncasting a glance toward Dalinar. How would this be if the man weren’t\ntrapped in the past? If he’d been willing to see the real world, rather than\nimagining it?\nYou’d probably have ended up killing him then too, Sadeas admitted to\nhimself. Don’t try to pretend otherwise.\nBest to be honest, at the very least, with oneself.\nShallan’s Sketchbook: Unclaimed Hills Lait Flora\n30.

Shallan took the\nwoman’s spyglass and raised it to look more closely. “Plants,” Shallan said.\n“There’s a rock overhang there, sheltering them from the east.”\n“Oh, is that all?” Tyn settled back, closing her eyes. “Thought it might\nbe a caravan tent or something.”\n“Tyn, it’s plants.”\n“So?”\n“Divergent flora in an otherwise uniform ecosystem!” Shallan\nexclaimed. “We’re going! I’ll go tell Macob to steer the caravan that way.”\n“Kid, you’re kind of strange,” Tyn said as Shallan yelled at the other\nwagons to stop.\nMacob was reluctant to agree to the detour, but fortunately he accepted\nher authority. The caravan was about a day out from the Shattered Plains.\nThey’d been taking it easy. Shallan struggled to contain her excitement. So\nmuch out here in the Frostlands was uniformly dull; something new to draw\nwas exciting beyond normal reason.\nThey approached the ridge, which had caused a high shelf of rock at\nexactly the right angle to form a windbreak. Larger versions of these\nformations were called laits. Sheltered valleys where a town could flourish.\nWell, this wasn’t nearly so large, but life had still found it. A grove of short,\nbone-white trees grew here. They had vivid red leaves. Vines of numerous\nvarieties draped the rock wall itself, and the ground teemed with rockbuds,\na variety that remained open even when there wasn’t rain, blossoms\ndrooping with heavy petals from the inside, along with tonguelike tendrils\nthat moved like worms, seeking water.\nA small pond reflected the blue sky, feeding the rockbuds and trees. The\nleafy shade in turn gave shelter to a bright green moss. The beauty was like\nveins of ruby and emerald in a drab stone."

The beauty was like\nveins of ruby and emerald in a drab stone.\nShallan hopped down the moment the wagons pulled up. She frightened\nsomething in the underbrush, and a few very small, feral axehounds burst\naway. She wasn’t sure of the breed—she honestly wasn’t even sure they\nwere axehounds, they moved so quickly.\nWell, she thought, walking into the tiny lait, that probably means I don’t\nhave to worry about anything larger. A predator like a whitespine would\nhave frightened away smaller life.\nShallan walked forward with a smile. It was almost like a garden,\nthough the plants were obviously wild rather than cultivated. They moved\nquickly to retract blooms, feelers, and leaves, opening a patch around her.\nShe stifled a sneeze and pushed through to find a dark green pond.\nHere, she set down a blanket on a boulder, then settled herself to sketch.\nOthers from the caravan went scouting through the lait or around the top of\nthe rock wall.\nShallan breathed in the wonderful humidity as the plants relaxed.\nRockbud petals stretching out, timid leaves unfolding. Color swelled around\nher like nature blushing. Stormfather! She hadn’t realized how much she’d\nmissed the variety of beautiful plants. She opened her sketchbook and drew\nout a quick prayer in the name of Shalash, Herald of Beauty, Shallan’s\nnamesake.\nThe plants retracted again as someone moved through them. Gaz\nstumbled past a group of rockbuds, cursing as he tried not to step on their\nvines. He came up to her, then hesitated, looking down at the pool.\n“Storms!” he said. “Are those fish?”\n“Eels,” Shallan guessed as something rippled the green surface of the\npool. “Bright orange ones, it appears. We had some like them back in my\nfather’s ornamental garden.”\nGaz leaned down, trying to get a good look, until one of the eels broke\nthe surface with a flipping tail, spraying him with water. Shallan laughed,\ntaking a Memory of the one-eyed man peering into those verdant depths,\nlips pursed, wiping his forehead.\n“What do you want, Gaz?”\n“Well,” he said, shuffling. “I was wondering…” He glanced at the\nsketchpad.\nShallan flipped to a new page in the pad. “Of course. Like the one I did\nfor Glurv, I assume?”\nGaz coughed into his hand. “Yeah. That one looked right nice.”\nShallan smiled, then started sketching.\n“Do you need me to pose or something?” Gaz asked.\n“Sure,” she said, mostly to keep him busy while she drew. She tidied up\nhis uniform, smoothing out his paunch, taking liberties with his chin. Most\nof the difference, however, had to do with the expression. Looking up, into\nthe distance. With the right expression, that eye patch became noble, that\nscarred face became wise, that uniform became a mark of pride. She filled it\nin with some light background details reminiscent of that night beside the\nfires, when the people of the caravan had thanked Gaz and the others for\ntheir rescue."

Gaz\ntook it reverently, running his hand through his hair. “Storms,” he\nwhispered. “Is that really what I looked like?”\n“Yes,” Shallan said. She could faintly feel Pattern as he vibrated softly\nnearby. A lie… but also a truth. That was certainly how the people Gaz\nsaved had viewed him.\n“Thank you, Brightness,” Gaz said. “I… Thank you.” Ash’s eyes! He\nactually seemed to be tearing up.\n“Keep it safe,” Shallan said, “and don’t fold it until tonight. I’ll lacquer\nit so it won’t smudge.”\nHe nodded and walked, frightening the plants again as he retreated. He\nwas the sixth of the men to ask her for a likeness. She encouraged the\nrequests. Anything to remind them of what they could, and should, be.\nAnd you, Shallan? she thought. Everyone seems to want you to be\nsomething. Jasnah, Tyn, your father… What do you want to be?\nShe flipped back through her sketchbook, finding the pages where she’d\ndrawn herself in a half-dozen different situations. A scholar, a woman of the\ncourt, an artist. Which did she want to be?\nCould she be them all?\nPattern hummed. Shallan glanced to the side, noticing Vathah lurking in\nthe trees nearby. The tall mercenary leader hadn’t said anything of the\nsketches, but she saw his sneers.\n“Stop frightening my plants, Vathah,” Shallan said.\n“Macob says we’ll stop for the night,” Vathah replied, then moved\naway.\n“Trouble…” Pattern buzzed. “Yes, trouble.”\n“I know,” Shallan said, waiting as the foliage returned, then sketching it.\nUnfortunately, though she’d been able to get charcoal and lacquer from the\nmerchants, she didn’t have any colored chalks, or she might have tried\nsomething more ambitious. Still, this would be a nice series of studies.\nQuite a change from the rest in this sketchbook.\nShe pointedly did not think about what she had lost.\nShe drew and drew, enjoying the simple peace of the small thicket.\nLifespren joined her, the little green motes bobbing between leaves and\nblossoms. Pattern moved out onto the water and, amusingly, began quietly\ncounting the leaves on a nearby tree. Shallan got a good half-dozen\ndrawings of the pond and trees, hoping she’d be able to identify those from\na book later on. She made sure to do some close-up views showing the\nleaves in detail, then moved on to drawing whatever struck her.\nIt was so nice to not be moving on a wagon while sketching. The\nenvironment here was just perfect—sufficient light for drawing, still and\nserene, surrounded by life…\nShe paused, noticing what she’d drawn: a rocky shore near the ocean,\nwith distinctive cliffs rising behind. The perspective was distant; on the\nrocky shore, several shadowy figures helped one another out of the water.\nShe swore one of them was Yalb."

The perspective was distant; on the\nrocky shore, several shadowy figures helped one another out of the water.\nShe swore one of them was Yalb.\nA hopeful fancy. She wished so much for them to be alive. She would\nprobably never know.\nShe turned the page and drew what came to her. A sketch of a woman\nkneeling over a body, raising a hammer and chisel, as if to slam it down into\nthe person’s face. The one beneath her was stiff, wooden… maybe even\nstone?\nShallan shook her head as she lowered her pencil and studied this\ndrawing. Why had she drawn it? The first one made sense—she was\nworried about Yalb and the other sailors. But what did it say about her\nsubconscious that she’d drawn this strange depiction?\nShe looked up, realizing that shadows had grown long, the sun easing\ndown to rest on the horizon. Shallan smiled at it, then jumped as she saw\nsomeone standing not ten paces away.\n“Tyn!” Shallan said, raising her safehand to her breast. “Stormfather!\nYou gave me a fright.”\nThe woman picked her way through the foliage, which shied away from\nher. “Those drawings are nice, but I think you should spend more time\npracticing to forge signatures. You’re a natural at that, and it’s a kind of\nwork you could do without having to worry about getting into trouble.”\n“I do practice it,” Shallan said. “But I need to practice my art too.”\n“You get really into those drawings, don’t you?”\n“I don’t get into them,” Shallan said, “I put others into them.”\nTyn grinned, reaching Shallan’s stone. “Always fast with a quip. I like\nthat. I need to introduce you to some friends of mine once we reach the\nShattered Plains. They’ll spoil you right quick.”\n“That doesn’t sound very pleasant.”\n“Nonsense,” Tyn said, hopping up onto a dry part of the next rock over.\n“You’d still be yourself. Your jokes would merely be dirtier.”\n“Lovely,” Shallan said, blushing.\nShe thought the blush might make Tyn laugh, but instead the woman\nbecame thoughtful. “We are going to have to figure out a way to give you a\ntaste of realism, Shallan.”\n“Oh? Does it come in the form of a tonic these days?”\n“No,” Tyn said, “it comes in the form of a punch to the face. It leaves\nnice girls crying, assuming they’re lucky enough to survive.”\n“I think you’ll find,” Shallan said, “that my life hasn’t been one of\nnonstop blossoms and cake.”\n“I’m sure you think that,” Tyn said. “Everyone does. Shallan, I like you,\nI really do. I think you’ve got heaps of potential. But what you’re training\nfor… it will require you to do very difficult things. Things that wrench the\nsoul, rip it apart. You’re going to be in situations that you’ve never been in\nbefore.”\n“You barely know me,” Shallan said. “How can you be so certain I’ve\nnever done things like this?”\n“Because you aren’t broken,” Tyn said, expression distant.\n“Perhaps I’m faking.”"

This is the last chance for you to back out.”\n“I…”\nWhat was she going to do about Tyn when she arrived? Admit that she\nhad only gone along with Tyn’s assumptions in order to learn from her? She\nknows people, Shallan thought. People in the warcamps who might be very\nuseful to know.\nShould Shallan continue with the subterfuge? She wanted to, though\npart of her knew it was because she liked Tyn, and didn’t want to give the\nwoman a reason to stop teaching her. “I am committed,” Shallan found\nherself saying. “I want to go through with my plan.”\nA lie.\nTyn sighed, then nodded. “All right. Are you ready to tell me what this\ngrand scam is?”\n“Dalinar Kholin,” Shallan said. “His son is betrothed to a woman from\nJah Keved.”\nTyn raised an eyebrow. “Now that’s curious. And the woman isn’t going\nto arrive?”\n“Not when he expects,” Shallan said.\n“And you look like her?”\n“You could say that.”\nTyn smiled. “Nice. You had me thinking it would be blackmail, which is\nvery tough. This, though, this is a scam you might actually be able to do.\nI’m impressed. It’s bold, but attainable.”\n“Thank you.”\n“So what’s your plan?” Tyn said.\n“Well, I’ll go introduce myself to Kholin, indicate I’m the woman his\nson is to marry, and let him set me up in his household.”\n“No good.”\n“No?”\nTyn shook her head sharply. “It puts you too much in Kholin’s debt. It\nwill make you seem needy, and that will undermine your ability to be\nrespected. What you’re doing here is called a pretty face con, an attempt to\nrelieve a rich man of his spheres. That kind of job is all about presentation\nand image. You want to set up in an inn somewhere in a different warcamp\nand act like you’re completely self-sufficient. Maintain an air of mystery.\nDon’t be too easy for the son to capture. Which one is it, by the way? The\nolder one or the younger one?”\n“Adolin,” Shallan said.\n“Hmmm… Not sure if that’s better or worse than Renarin. Adolin\nKholin is a flirt by reputation, so I can see why his father wants him\nmarried off. It will be tough to keep his attention, though.”\n“Really?” Shallan asked, feeling a spike of real concern."

I’ll have to work on this\none awhile to determine the right approach, but you are certainly not going\nto accept Kholin hospitality. Adolin will never express interest if you’re not\nin some way unobtainable.”\n“Hard to be unobtainable when we’re already in a causal.”\n“Still important,” Tyn said, raising a finger. “You’re the one who wants\nto do a love scam. They’re tricky, but relatively safe. We’ll figure this out.”\nShallan nodded, though inside, her worries had spiked. What would\nhappen with the betrothal? Jasnah wasn’t around to push for it any longer.\nThe woman had wanted Shallan tied to her family, presumably because of\nthe Surgebinding potential. Shallan doubted the rest of the Kholin house\nwould be so determined to have a nobody Veden girl marry into the family.\nAs Tyn rose, Shallan stuffed away her anxiety. If the betrothal ended, so\nbe it. She had far more important concerns in Urithiru and the Voidbringers.\nShe would have to figure out a way to deal with Tyn, though—a way that\ndidn’t involve actually scamming the Kholin family.

Was the air stale?\n“Sir?”\nKaladin turned. One of the bridgemen, an earnest man with short dark\nhair and strong features, had not joined the others at the stew cauldron.\nKaladin searched for his name…\n“Pitt, isn’t it?” Kaladin said.\n“Yes, sir,” the man replied. “Bridge Seventeen.”\n“What did you need?”\n“I just…” The man glanced at the inviting fire, with members of Bridge\nFour laughing and chatting with the patrol group. Nearby, someone had\nhung a few distinctive suits of armor on the barrack walls. They were\ncarapace helms and breastplates, attached to the leathers of common\nbridgemen. Those had now been replaced with fine steel caps and\nbreastplates. Kaladin wondered who had hung the old suits up. He hadn’t\neven known that some of the men had fetched them; they were the extra\nsuits that Leyten had crafted for the men and stashed down in the chasms\nbefore being freed.\n“Sir,” Pitt said, “I just want to say that I’m sorry.”\n“For?”\n“Back when we were bridgemen.” Pitt raised a hand to his head.\n“Storms, that seems like a different life. I couldn’t think rightly during those\ntimes. It’s all hazy. But I remember being glad when your crew was sent out\ninstead of mine. I remember hoping you’d fail, since you dared to walk with\nyour chin up… I—”\n“It’s all right, Pitt,” Kaladin said. “It wasn’t your fault. You can blame\nSadeas.”\n“I suppose.” Pitt got a distant look on his face. “He broke us right good,\ndidn’t he, sir?”\n“Yes.”\n“Turns out, though, men can be reforged. I wouldn’t have thought that.”\nPitt looked over his shoulder. “I’m going to have to go do this for the other\nlads of Bridge Seventeen, aren’t I?”\n“With Teft’s help, yes, but that’s the hope,” Kaladin said. “Do you think\nyou can do it?”\n“I’ll just have to pretend to be you, sir,” Pitt said. He smiled, then\nmoved on, taking a bowl of stew and joining the others.\nThese forty would be ready soon, ready to become sergeants to their\nown teams of bridgemen. The transformation had happened more quickly\nthan Kaladin had hoped. Teft, you marvelous man, he thought. You did it.\nWhere was Teft, anyway? He’d gone on the patrol with them, and now\nhe’d vanished. Kaladin glanced over his shoulder but didn’t see him;\nperhaps he’d gone to check on some of the other bridge crews. He did catch\nRock shooing away a lanky man in an ardent’s robe.\n“What was that?” Kaladin asked, catching the Horneater as he passed.\n“That one,” Rock said. “Keeps loitering here with sketchbook.

He let Rock return to his stew and stepped away\nfrom the fire, enjoying the peace.\nEverything was so quiet out there, in the camp. Like it was holding its\nbreath.\n“The patrol seems to have worked out,” Sigzil said, strolling up to\nKaladin. “Those men are changed.”\n“Funny what a couple of days spent marching as a unit can do to\nsoldiers,” Kaladin said. “Have you seen Teft?”\n“No, sir,” Sigzil said. He nodded toward the fire. “You’ll want to get\nsome stew. We won’t have much time for chatting tonight.”\n“Highstorm,” Kaladin realized. It seemed like too soon since the last\none, but they weren’t always regular—not in the way he thought of it. The\nstormwardens had to do complex mathematics to predict them; Kaladin’s\nfather had made a hobby of it.\nPerhaps that was what he was noticing. Was he suddenly predicting\nhighstorms because the night seemed too… something?\nYou’re imagining things, Kaladin thought. Shrugging off his fatigue\nfrom the extended ride and march, he went over to get some stew. He’d\nhave to eat quickly—he’d want to go join the men guarding Dalinar and the\nking during the storm.\nThe men from the patrol cheered him as he filled his bowl.\n* * *\nShallan sat on the rattling wagon and moved her hand over the sphere\non the seat beside her, palming it and dropping another.\nTyn raised an eyebrow. “I heard the replacement hit.”\n“Drynets!” Shallan said. “I thought I had it.”\n“Drynets?”\n“It’s a curse,” Shallan said, blushing. “I heard it from the sailors.”\n“Shallan, do you have any idea at all what that means?”\n“Like… for fishing?” Shallan said. “The nets are dry, maybe? They\nhaven’t been catching any fish, so it’s bad?”\nTyn grinned. “Dear, I’m going to do my very best to corrupt you. Until\nthen, I think you should avoid using sailor curses. Please.”\n“All right.” Shallan passed her hand over the sphere again, swapping the\nspheres. “No clink! Did you hear that? Or, um, did you not hear that? It\ndidn’t make a noise!”\n“Nice,” Tyn said, getting out a pinch of some kind of mossy substance.\nShe began rubbing it between her fingers, and Shallan thought she saw\nsmoke rising from the moss. “You are getting better. I also feel like we\nshould figure out some way to use that drawing talent of yours.”\nShallan already had an inkling of how it would come in handy. More of\nthe former deserters had asked her for pictures.\n“You’ve been working on your accents?” Tyn asked, eyes glazing as she\nrubbed the moss.\n“I have indeed, my good woman,” Shallan said with a Thaylen accent.\n“Good.

You blush at the mere mention of exposing your safehand.\nCan’t you see how it’s going to be hard for you to run any kind of\nproductive scam?”\nShallan took a deep breath. “I guess.”\n“Showing your hand off isn’t going to be the toughest thing you need to\ndo,” Tyn said, looking distant. “Not the toughest by a breeze or a\nstormwind. I…”\n“What?” Shallan asked.\nTyn shook her head. “We’ll talk about it later. Can you see those\nwarcamps yet?”\nShallan stood up on her seat, shading her eyes against the setting sun in\nthe west. To the north, she saw a haze. Hundreds of fires—no, thousands—\nseeping darkness into the sky. Her breath caught in her throat. “We’re\nthere.”\n“Call camp for the night,” Tyn said, not moving from her relaxed\nposition.\n“It looks like it’s only a few hours away,” Shallan said. “We could push\non—”\n“And arrive after nightfall, then be forced to camp anyway,” Tyn said.\n“Better to arrive fresh in the morning. Trust me.”\nShallan settled down, calling for one of the caravan workers, a youth\nwho walked barefoot—his calluses must be frightening—alongside the\ncaravan. Only those senior among them rode.\n“Ask Trademaster Macob what he thinks of stopping here for the night,”\nShallan said to the young man.\nHe nodded, then jogged up the line, passing lumbering chulls.\n“You don’t trust my assessment?” Tyn asked, sounding amused."

Not that I\nhaven’t tried to figure out all three.”\nTyn smiled, eyes closed. “Your Veden king is dead.”\n“Hanavanar? Dead?” She’d never met the highprince, let alone the king.\nThe monarchy was a far-off thing. She found that it didn’t particularly\nmatter to her. “His son will inherit, then?”\n“He would. If he weren’t dead too. Along with six of Jah Keved’s\nhighprinces.”\nShallan gasped.\n“They say it was the Assassin in White,” Tyn said softly, eyes still\nclosed. “The Shin man who killed the Alethi king six years back.”\nShallan pushed through her confusion. Her brothers. Were they all\nright? “Six highprinces. Which ones?” If she knew that, it might tell her\nhow her own princedom was fairing.\n“I don’t know for certain,” Tyn said. “Jal Mala and Evinor for sure, and\nprobably Abrial. Some died in the attack, others before that, though the\ninformation is vague. Getting any kind of reliable information out of\nVedenar these days is tough.”\n“Valam. He still lives?” Her own highprince.\n“He was fighting for the succession, reports say. I have my informants\nsending me word tonight via spanreed. Might have something for you\nthen.”"

Might have something for you\nthen.”\nShallan settled back. The king, dead? A succession war? Stormfather!\nHow could she find out about her family and their estate? They were\nnowhere near the capital, but if the entire country was consumed by war, it\ncould reach even to the backwater areas. There was no easy way to reach\nher brothers. She’d lost her own spanreed in the sinking of the Wind’s\nPleasure.\n“Any information would be appreciated,” Shallan said. “Any at all.”\n“We’ll see. I’ll let you come by for the report.”\nShallan settled back to digest this information. She suspected I didn’t\nknow, but didn’t tell me until now. Shallan liked Tyn, but had to remember\nthat the woman made a profession of hiding information. What else did Tyn\nknow that she wasn’t sharing?\nAhead, the caravan youth walked back down the line of moving\nwagons. As he reached Shallan, he turned and walked beside her vehicle.\n“Macob says you are wise to ask, and says we should probably camp here.\nThe warcamps each have secure borders, and aren’t likely to let us in during\nthe night. Beyond that, he is uncertain if we could reach the camps before\ntonight’s storm.”\nTo the side, eyes still closed, Tyn grinned.\n“We camp, then,” Shallan said.\n32. The One Who Hates\nThe spren betrayed us, it’s often felt.\nOur minds are too close to their realm\nThat gives us our forms, but more is then\nDemanded by the smartest spren,\nWe can’t provide what the humans lend,\nThough broth are we, their meat is men.\nFrom the Listener Song of Spren, 9th\nstanza\nIn his dream, Kaladin was the storm.\nHe claimed the land, surging across it, a cleansing fury. All washed\nbefore him, broke before him. In his darkness, the land was reborn.\nHe soared, alive with lightning, his flashes of inspiration. The wind’s\nhowling was his voice, the thunder his heartbeat. He overwhelmed,\novercame, overshadowed, and—\nAnd he had done this before.\nAn awareness came to Kaladin, like water seeping under a door. Yes.\nHe’d dreamed this dream before.\nWith effort, he turned around. A face as large as eternity stretched\nbehind him, the force behind the tempest, the Stormfather himself.\nSON OF HONOR, said a voice like roaring wind.\n“This is real!” Kaladin yelled into the storm. He was wind itself. Spren.\nHe found voice somehow. “You are real!”\nSHE TRUSTS YOU.\n“Syl?” Kaladin called. “Yes, she does.”\nSHE SHOULD NOT.\n“Are you the one who forbade her to come to me? Are you the one who\nkeeps the spren back?”\nYOU WILL KILL HER. The voice, so deep, so powerful, sounded\nregretful. Mournful. YOU WILL MURDER MY CHILD AND LEAVE\nHER CORPSE TO WICKED MEN.\n“I will not!” Kaladin shouted."

Kaladin saw the world from above. Ships in\nsheltered harbors rocking on violent swells. Armies huddled in valleys,\npreparing for war in a place of many hills and mountains. A vast lake going\ndry ahead of his arrival, the water retreating into holes in the rock beneath.\n“How can I prevent it?” Kaladin demanded. “How can I protect her?”\nYOU ARE HUMAN. YOU WILL BE A TRAITOR.\n“No I won’t!”\nYOU WILL CHANGE. MEN CHANGE. ALL MEN.\nThe continent was so vast. So many people speaking languages he could\nnot comprehend, everyone hiding in their rooms, their caverns, their\nvalleys.\nAH, the Stormfather said. SO IT WILL END.\n“What?” Kaladin shouted into the winds. “What changed? I feel—”\nHE COMES FOR YOU, LITTLE TRAITOR. I AM SORRY.\nSomething rose before Kaladin. A second storm, one of red lightning, so\nenormous as to make the continent—the world itself—into nothing by\ncomparison. Everything fell into its shadow.\nI AM SORRY, the Stormfather said. HE COMES.\nKaladin awoke, heart thundering in his chest.\nHe almost fell from his chair. Where was he? The Pinnacle, the king’s\nconference chamber. Kaladin had sat down for a moment and…\nHe blushed. He’d dozed off.\nAdolin stood nearby, talking to Renarin. “I’m not sure if anything will\ncome from the meeting, but I’m glad Father agreed to it. I’d almost given\nup hope of it happening, with how long the Parshendi messenger took to\narrive.”\n“You’re sure the one you met out there was a woman?” Renarin asked.\nHe seemed more at ease since he had finished bonding his Blade a couple\nweeks back, and no longer needed to carry it around. “A woman\nShardbearer?”\n“The Parshendi are pretty odd,” Adolin said with a shrug. He glanced\ntoward Kaladin, and his lips rose in a smirk. “Sleeping on the job,\nbridgeboy?”\nThe leaking shutter shook nearby, water dribbling in under the wood.\nNavani and Dalinar would be in the room next door.\nThe king wasn’t there.\n“His Majesty!” Kaladin cried, scrambling to his feet.\n“In the privy, bridgeboy,” Adolin said, nodding to another door. “You\ncan sleep during a highstorm. That’s impressive. Almost as impressive as\nhow much you drool when you’re dozing.”\nNo time for gibes. That dream… Kaladin turned toward the balcony\ndoor, breathing quickly.\nHe comes…\nKaladin pulled open the balcony door. Adolin shouted and Renarin\ncalled out, but Kaladin ignored them, facing the tempest.\nThe wind still howled and rain pelted the stone balcony with a sound\nlike sticks breaking. There was no lightning, however, and the wind—while\nviolent—was not nearly strong enough to fling boulders or topple walls.\nThe bulk of the highstorm had passed."

Wind from the depths of nothingness, battering him. He felt\nas if he were standing above the void itself, Damnation, known as Braize in\nthe old songs. Home to demons and monsters. He stepped out hesitantly,\nlight from the still-open door spilling onto the wet balcony. He found the\nrailing—a part that was still secure—and clenched it in cold fingers. Rain\nbit him on the cheek, seeping through his uniform, burrowing through the\ncloth and seeking warm skin.\n“Are you mad?” Adolin demanded from the doorway. Kaladin could\nbarely hear his voice over the wind and distant rumbles of thunder.\n* * *\nPattern hummed softly as rain fell on the wagon.\nShallan’s slaves huddled together and whimpered. She wished she could\nquiet the blasted spren, but Pattern wasn’t responding to her promptings. At\nleast the highstorm was nearly over. She wanted to get away and read what\nTyn’s correspondents had to say about Shallan’s homeland.\nPattern’s hums sounded almost like a whimper. Shallan frowned and\nleaned down close to him. Were those words?\n“Bad… bad… so bad…”\n* * *\nSyl shot out of the highstorm’s dense darkness, a sudden flash of light in\nthe black. She spun about Kaladin before coming to rest on the iron railing\nbefore him. Her dress seemed longer and more flowing than usual. The rain\npassed through her without disturbing her shape.\nSyl looked into the sky, then turned her head sharply over her shoulder.\n“Kaladin. Something is wrong.”\n“I know.”\nSyl spun about, twisting this way, then that. Her small eyes opened\nwide. “He’s coming.”\n“Who? The storm?”\n“The one who hates,” she whispered. “The darkness inside. Kaladin,\nhe’s watching. Something’s going to happen. Something bad.”\nKaladin hesitated only a moment, then scrambled back into the room,\npushing past Adolin and entering the light. “Get the king. We’re leaving.\nNow.”\n“What?” Adolin demanded.\nKaladin threw open the door into the small room where Dalinar and\nNavani waited. The highprince sat on a sofa, expression distant, Navani\nholding his hand. That wasn’t what Kaladin had expected. The highprince\ndidn’t seem frightened or mad, just thoughtful. He was speaking softly.\nKaladin froze. He sees things during the storms.\n“What are you doing?” Navani demanded. “How dare you?”\n“Can you wake him?” Kaladin asked, stepping into the room. “We need\nto leave this room, leave this palace.”\n“Nonsense.” It was the king’s voice. Elhokar stepped into the room\nbehind him. “What are you babbling about?”\n“You’re not safe here, Your Majesty,” Kaladin said. “We need to get you\nout of the palace and take you to the warcamp.” Storms. Would that be\nsafe? Should he go somewhere nobody would expect?\nThunder rumbled outside, but the sound of rainfall slackened. The storm\nwas dying."

Should he go somewhere nobody would expect?\nThunder rumbled outside, but the sound of rainfall slackened. The storm\nwas dying.\n“This is ridiculous,” Adolin said from behind the king, throwing his\nhands into the air. “This is the safest place in the warcamps. You want us to\nleave? Drag the king out into the storm?”\n“We need to wake the highprince,” Kaladin said, reaching for Dalinar.\nDalinar caught his arm as he did so. “The highprince is awake,” Dalinar\nsaid, his gaze clearing, returning from the distant place where it had been.\n“What is going on here?”\n“The bridgeboy wants us to evacuate the palace,” Adolin said.\n“Soldier?” Dalinar asked.\n“It’s not safe here, sir.”\n“What makes you say that?”\n“Instinct, sir.”\nThe room grew still. Outside, the rainfall slackened to a gentle patter.\nThe riddens had arrived.\n“We go, then,” Dalinar said, rising.\n“What?” the king demanded.\n“You put this man in charge of your guard, Elhokar,” Dalinar said. “If\nhe thinks our position is not safe, we should do as he says.”\nThere was an implied for now after that sentence, but Kaladin didn’t\ncare. He shoved past the king and Adolin, rushing back through the main\nchamber to the doorway out. His heart hammered inside of him, his muscles\ntense. Syl, visible only to his eyes, flitted through the room, frantic.\nKaladin threw open the doors. Six men stood on watch in the hallway\nbeyond, mostly bridgemen with one member of the King’s Guard, a man\nnamed Ralinor. “We’re leaving,” Kaladin said, pointing. “Beld and Hobber,\nyou’re an advance squad. Scout the way out of the building—the back way,\ndown through the kitchens—and give a shout if you see anything unusual.\nMoash, you and Ralinor are the rear guard—watch this room until I’ve got\nthe king and the highprince out of sight, then follow. Mart and Eth, you stay\nat the king’s side, no matter what.”\nThe guards scrambled into action without question. As the scouts ran\nahead, Kaladin moved back to the king and grabbed him by the arm, then\nhauled him toward the door. Elhokar allowed it, a stunned expression on his\nface.\nThe other lighteyes followed. The bridgeman brothers Mart and Eth fell\nin, flanking the king, Moash holding the doorway. He gripped his spear\nnervously, pointing it in one direction, then another.\nKaladin rushed the king and his family down the corridor along the\nchosen path. Instead of heading left and down the incline toward the\npalace’s formal entrance, they would head right, farther into its bowels.\nDown to the right, through the kitchens, then out into the night.\nThe hallways were silent. Everyone was sheltering in their rooms during\nthe highstorm.\nDalinar joined Kaladin at the front of the group. “I will be curious to\nhear exactly what prompted this, soldier,” he said. “Once we are safely\nevacuated.”"

That’s what prompted it. How was he going to explain\nthat? That he’d listened to a windspren?\nDeeper they went. Storms, these empty corridors were disturbing. Much\nof the palace was really just a burrow cut through the rock of the peak, with\nwindows carved out of the sides.\nKaladin froze in place.\nThe lights ahead were out, the corridor dimming into the distance until\nit was dark as a mine.\n“Wait,” Adolin said, stopping in place. “Why is it dark? What happened\nto the spheres?”\nThey’ve been drained of Light.\nDamnation. And what was that on the wall of the hallway up ahead? A\nlarge patch of blackness. Kaladin frantically fished a sphere from his pocket\nand raised it. It was a hole! A doorway had been cut into this corridor from\nthe outside, sliced directly through the rock. A cold breeze blew inward.\nKaladin’s light also illuminated something on the floor just ahead. A\nbody lying where corridors crossed. It wore a blue uniform. Beld, one of the\nmen Kaladin had sent on ahead.\nThe huddle of people stared at the body in horror. The corridor’s eerie\nsilence, the lack of lights, had stilled even the king’s protests.\n“He’s here,” Syl whispered.\nA solemn figure stepped out of the side corridor, holding a long, silvery\nBlade that cut a trail in the stone floor. The figure had flowing white\nclothing: filmy trousers and an overshirt that rippled with each step. Bald\nhead, pale skin. Shin.\nKaladin recognized the figure. Every person in Alethkar had heard of\nthis man. The Assassin in White. Kaladin had seen him once in a dream,\nlike the one earlier, though he hadn’t recognized him at that point.\nStormlight streamed from the assassin’s body.\nHe was a Surgebinder.\n“Adolin, with me!” Dalinar shouted. “Renarin, protect the king! Take\nhim back the way we came!” With that, Dalinar—the Blackthorn—seized a\nspear from one of Kaladin’s men and charged the assassin.\nHe’s going to get himself killed, Kaladin thought, running after him. “Go\nwith Prince Renarin!” he yelled at his men. “Do as he tells you! Protect the\nking!”\nThe men—including Moash and Ralinor, who had caught up to them—\nbegan a frantic retreat, towing away Navani and the king.\n“Father!” Renarin cried. Moash grabbed him by the shoulder and hauled\nhim back. “I can fight!”\n“Go!” Dalinar bellowed. “Protect the king!”\nAs Kaladin charged with Dalinar and Adolin, the last thing he heard of\nthe group was King Elhokar’s whimpering voice. “He’s come for me. I\nalways knew he would. Like he came for Father…”\nKaladin drew in as much Stormlight as he dared. The Assassin in White\nstood calmly in the corridor, streaming with his own Light. How could he"

How could he\nbe a Surgebinder? What spren had chosen this man?\nAdolin’s Shardblade formed in his hands.\n“Trident,” Dalinar said softly, slowing as the three of them approached\nthe assassin. “I’m the middle. You familiar with that, Kaladin?”\n“Yes, sir.” It was a simple, small-squad battlefield formation.\n“Let me handle this, Father,” Adolin said. “He has a Shardblade, and I\ndon’t like the look of that glow—”\n“No,” Dalinar said, “we hit him together.” His eyes narrowed as he\nregarded the assassin, still standing calmly above the body of poor Beld.\n“I’m not asleep at the table this time, you bastard. You’re not taking another\none from me!”\nThe three charged together. Dalinar, as the middle tine of the trident,\nwould try to hold the assassin’s attention while Kaladin and Adolin attacked\nfrom either side. He’d wisely taken the spear for reach, rather than using his\nside sword. They charged in a rush to confuse and overwhelm.\nThe assassin waited until they were close, then jumped, trailing Light.\nHe twisted in the air as Dalinar bellowed and thrust with his spear.\nThe assassin did not come down. Instead, he landed on the ceiling of the\ncorridor some twelve feet above.\n“It’s true,” Adolin said, sounding haunted. He bent back, raising his\nShardblade to attack at the awkward angle. The assassin, however, ran\ndown the wall in a rustle of white cloth, battering aside Adolin’s Shardblade\nwith his own, then slammed his hand into Adolin’s chest.\nAdolin flipped upward as if he’d been tossed. His body streamed\nStormlight and he crashed into the ceiling above. He groaned, rolling over,\nbut remained on the ceiling.\nStormfather! Kaladin thought, pulse pounding, tempest within raging.\nHe thrust his spear alongside that of the Blackthorn in an attempt to hit the\nassassin.\nThe man didn’t dodge.\nBoth spears struck flesh, Dalinar’s in the shoulder, Kaladin’s in the side.\nThe assassin spun, sweeping his Shardblade through the spears and cutting\nthem in half, as if he didn’t even care about the wounds. He lunged forward,\nslapping Dalinar across the face, sending him sprawling to the ground, then\nswept his Blade toward Kaladin.\nKaladin barely ducked the blow, then scrambled backward, the top of\nhis spear clattering to the ground beside Dalinar, who rolled with a groan,\nholding a hand to his cheek where the assassin had struck him. Blood\nseeped from torn skin. The blow of a Surgebinder bearing Stormlight could\nnot just be shaken off.\nThe assassin stood poised and confident in the center of the corridor.\nStormlight swirled in the slashes in his now-reddened clothing, healing his\nflesh.\nKaladin backed away, holding a spear missing its head.

The youth had climbed to his\nfeet, but the Stormlight streaming from him had nearly run out. He tried to\nattack the assassin, but slipped from the ceiling and crashed to the ground,\nlanding on his shoulder. His Shardblade vanished as it fell from his fingers.\nThe assassin stepped over Adolin, who stirred but did not rise. “I am\nsorry,” the assassin said, Stormlight streaming from his mouth. “I don’t\nwant to do this.”\n“I won’t give you the chance,” Kaladin growled, dashing forward. Syl\nspun around him, and he felt the wind stirring. He felt the tempest raging,\nurging him onward. He came at the assassin with the remnant of his spear\nwielded like a quarterstaff, and felt the wind guiding him.\nStrikes made with precision, a moment of oneness with the weapon. He\nforgot his worries, forgot his failures, forgot even his rage. Just Kaladin and\na spear.\nAs the world was meant to be.\nThe assassin took a blow to the shoulder, then the side. He couldn’t\nignore them all—his Stormlight would run out as it healed him. The\nassassin cursed, letting out another mouthful of Light, and backed away, his\nShin eyes—slightly too large, colored like pale sapphires—widening at the\ncontinued flurry of strikes.\nKaladin sucked in the rest of his Stormlight. So little. He hadn’t picked\nup new spheres before coming to guard duty. Stupid. Sloppy.\nThe assassin turned his shoulder, lifting his Shardblade, preparing to\nthrust. There, Kaladin thought. He could feel what would happen. He would\ntwist around the strike, bringing up the butt of his spear. It would hit the\nassassin on the side of the head, a powerful blow that even Stormlight\nwould not easily compensate for. He’d be left dazed. An opening.\nI have him.\nSomehow, the assassin twisted out of the way.\nHe moved too quickly, faster than Kaladin anticipated. As quickly… as\nKaladin himself. Kaladin’s blow found only open air, and he narrowly\navoided being run through by the Shardblade.\nKaladin’s next moves came by instinct. Years of training gave his\nmuscles minds of their own. If he’d been fighting an ordinary foe, the way\nhe automatically shifted his weapon to block the next swing would have\nbeen perfect. But the assassin had a Shardblade. Kaladin’s instincts—\ninstilled so diligently—betrayed him.\nThe silvery weapon sheared through the remnant of Kaladin’s spear,\nthen through Kaladin’s right arm, just below the elbow. A shock of\nincredible pain washed through Kaladin, and he gasped, falling to his knees.\nThen… nothing. He couldn’t feel the arm. It turned grey and dull,\nlifeless, the palm opening, fingers spreading as half of his spear shaft\ndropped from his fingers and thumped to the ground.\nThe assassin kicked Kaladin out of the way, slamming him against the\nwall.

You won’t take the only thing I have left of\nhim!”\nThe assassin stopped in the corridor just in front of Dalinar. “But I’m\nnot here for him, Highprince,” he whispered, Stormlight puffing from his\nlips. “I’m here for you.” The assassin lunged forward, slapping away\nDalinar’s strike, and kicked the Blackthorn in the leg.\nDalinar went down on one knee, his grunt echoing in the hallway as he\ndropped his spear.

One handhold was not enough, and Kaladin was\nthrown free.\nThen he hit.\nHe hit hard. No preparation, no getting his feet beneath him. He\nsmacked against cold, wet stone, and his vision flashed like lightning.\nIt cleared a moment later, and he found himself lying on the rocks at the\nbase of the rise that led to the king’s palace, a gentle rain sprinkling him. He\nlooked up at the distant light of the hole in the wall above. He’d survived.\nOne question answered, he thought, struggling to his knees on the wet\nrock. The Stormlight was already working on his skin, which was shredded\nalong his right side. He’d broken something in his shoulder; he could feel\nits healing as a burning pain that slowly retreated.\nBut his right forearm and hand, faintly lit by the Stormlight rising from\nthe rest of him, were still a dull grey. Like a dead candle in a row, this part\nof him did not glow. He couldn’t feel it; he couldn’t even move the fingers.\nThey drooped, limp, as he cradled the hand.\nNearby, the Assassin in White stood up straight in the rain. He’d\nsomehow gotten his feet beneath him and landed, in control, with poise.\nThis man had a level of experience with his powers that made Kaladin look\nlike a new recruit.\nThe assassin turned on Kaladin, then stopped short. He spoke softly in a\nlanguage Kaladin didn’t understand, the words breathy and sibilant, bearing\nlots of “sh” sounds.\nGot to move, Kaladin thought. Before he summons that Blade again.\nUnfortunately, he failed to shove down the horror at having lost the hand.\nNo more spear fighting. No more surgery. Both men he had learned to be\nwere now lost to him.\nExcept… he could almost feel…\n“Did I Lash you?” the assassin asked in accented Alethi. His eyes had\ndarkened, losing their sapphire blue quality. “To the ground? But why did\nyou not die falling? No. I must have Lashed you upward. Impossible.” He\nstepped back.\nA moment of surprise. A moment to live. Perhaps… Kaladin felt the\nLight working, the tempest within straining and pushing. He gritted his\nteeth and heaved somehow.\nThe color returned to his hand, and feeling—cold pain—suddenly\nflooded his arm, hand, fingers. Light began to stream from his hand.\n“No…” the assassin said. “No!”\nWhatever Kaladin had done to his hand had consumed much of his\nLight and his overall glow faded, leaving him barely alight. Still on his\nknees, gritting his teeth, Kaladin grabbed the knife from his belt, but found\nhis grip weak. He almost fumbled the weapon as he got it free.\nHe swapped the knife to his off hand. It would have to do.\nHe threw himself to his feet and charged the assassin. Have to hit him\nquickly to have a chance.\nThe assassin jumped backward, soaring a good ten feet, his white\nclothing rippling in the night air. He landed with a lithe grace, Shardblade\nappearing in his hand. “What are you?” he demanded."

He landed with a lithe grace, Shardblade\nappearing in his hand. “What are you?” he demanded.\n“Same thing you are,” Kaladin said. He felt a wave of nausea, but\nforced himself to appear firm. “Windrunner.”\n“You can’t be.”\nKaladin held up the knife, the few wisps of remaining Light steaming\nfrom his skin. Rain sprinkled him.\nThe assassin scrambled backward, eyes as wide as if Kaladin had turned\ninto a chasmfiend. “They told me I was a liar!” the assassin screamed.\n“They told me I was wrong! Szeth-son-son-Vallano… Truthless. They\nnamed me Truthless!”\nKaladin stepped forward as threateningly as he could manage, hoping\nhis Stormlight would last long enough to be imposing. He breathed out,\nletting it puff before him, faintly luminescent in the darkness.\nThe assassin scrambled back through a puddle. “Are they back?” he\ndemanded. “Are they all back?”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said. It seemed like the right answer. The answer that\nwould keep him alive, at least.\nThe assassin stared at him a moment longer, then turned and fled.\nKaladin watched the glowing form run, then lurch into the sky. He zipped\neastward as a streak of light.\n“Storms,” Kaladin said, then breathed out the last of his Light and\ncollapsed in a heap.\n* * *\nWhen he regained consciousness, Syl stood beside him on the rocky\nground, hands on her hips. “Sleeping when you’re supposed to be on guard\nduty?”\nKaladin groaned and sat up. He felt horribly weak, but he was alive.\nGood enough. He held up his hand, but couldn’t see much in the darkness\nnow that his Stormlight had faded.\nHe could move his fingers. His entire hand and forearm ached, but it\nwas the most wonderful ache he’d ever felt.\n“I healed,” he whispered, then coughed. “I healed from a Shardblade\nwound. Why didn’t you tell me I could do that?”\n“Because I didn’t know you could do it until you did it, silly.” She said\nit as if it were the most obvious fact in the world. Her voice grew softer.\n“There are dead. Up above.”\nKaladin nodded. Could he walk? He managed to get to his feet, and\nslowly made his way around the base of the Pinnacle, toward the steps on\nthe other side. Syl flitted around him anxiously. His strength began to return\na little as he found the steps and began to climb. He had to stop several\ntimes to catch his breath, and at one point he ripped off the sleeve of his\ncoat to hide that it had been cut through with a Shardblade.\nHe reached the top. Part of him feared that he’d find everyone dead. The\nhallways were silent. No shouts, no guards. Nothing. He continued on,\nfeeling alone, until he saw light ahead.\n“Stop!” called a trembling voice. Mart, of Bridge Four. “You in the\ndark!

Mart\nand Moash stood guard at the door to the king’s chambers, along with some\nof the men from the King’s Guard. They let out whoops of surprise as they\nrecognized Kaladin. They ushered him into the warmth and light of\nElhokar’s quarters.\nHere, he found Dalinar and Adolin—alive—sitting on the couches. Eth\ntended their wounds; Kaladin had trained a number of the men in Bridge\nFour in basic field medicine. Renarin slumped in a chair near the corner, his\nShardblade discarded at his feet like a piece of refuse. The king paced at the\nback of the room, speaking softly with his mother.\nDalinar stood up, shaking off Eth’s attention, as Kaladin entered. “By\nthe Almighty’s tenth name,” Dalinar said, voice hushed. “You’re alive?”\nKaladin nodded, then slumped down in one of the plush royal chairs,\nuncaring if he got water or blood on it. He let out a soft groan—half relief at\nseeing them all well, half exhaustion.\n“How?” Adolin demanded. “You fell. I was barely awake, but I know I\nsaw you fall.”\nI am a Surgebinder, Kaladin thought as Dalinar looked over at him. I\nused Stormlight. He wanted to say the words, but they wouldn’t come out.\nNot in front of Elhokar and Adolin.\nStorms. I’m a coward.\n“I had a good grip on him,” Kaladin said. “I don’t know. We tumbled in\nthe air, and when we hit, I wasn’t dead.”\nThe king nodded. “Didn’t you say he stuck you to the ceiling?” he said\nto Adolin. “They probably floated all the way down.”\n“Yeah,” Adolin said. “I suppose.”\n“After you landed,” the king said, hopefully, “did you kill him?”\n“No,” Kaladin said, “He ran off, though. I think he was surprised we\nfought back as capably as we did.”\n“Capably?” Adolin asked. “We were like three children attacking a\nchasmfiend with sticks. Stormfather! I’ve never been routed so soundly in\nmy life.”\n“At least we were alerted,” the king said, sounding shaken. “This\nbridgeman… he makes a good bodyguard. You will be commended, young\nman.”\nDalinar stood and crossed the room. Eth had cleaned up his face and\nplugged his bleeding nose. His skin was split along the left cheekbone, his\nnose broken, though surely not for the first time in Dalinar’s long military\ncareer. Both were wounds that looked worse than they really were.\n“How did you know?” Dalinar asked.\nKaladin met his eyes. Behind him, Adolin glanced over, narrowing his\neyes. He looked down at Kaladin’s arm and frowned.\nThat one saw something, Kaladin thought. As if he didn’t have enough\ntrouble with Adolin as it was.\n“I saw a light moving in the air outside,” Kaladin said. “I moved by\ninstinct.”\nNearby, Syl zipped into the room and looked pointedly at him,"

He had seen a light in the night. Hers.\n“All those years ago,” Dalinar said, “I dismissed the stories the\nwitnesses told of my brother’s assassination. Men walking on walls, others\nfalling up instead of down… Almighty above. What is he?”\n“Death,” Kaladin whispered.\nDalinar nodded.\n“Why has he come back now?” Navani asked, moving up to Dalinar’s\nside. “After all these years?”\n“He wants to claim me,” Elhokar said. His back was to them, and\nKaladin could make out a cup in his hand. He downed the contents, then\nimmediately refilled it from a jug. Deep violet wine. Elhokar’s hand was\ntrembling as he poured.\nKaladin met Dalinar’s eyes. The highprince had heard. This Szeth had\nnot come for the king, but Dalinar.\nDalinar didn’t say anything to correct the king, so Kaladin didn’t either.\n“What do we do if he comes back?” Adolin asked.\n“I don’t know,” Dalinar said, sitting back down on the couch beside his\nson. “I don’t know…”\nTend his wounds. It was the voice of Kaladin’s father, whispering inside\nhim. The surgeon. Stitch that cheek. Reset the nose.\nHe had a more important duty. Kaladin forced himself to his feet,\nthough he felt like he was carrying lead weights, and took a spear from one\nof the men at the door. “Why are the hallways silent?” he asked Moash.\n“Do you know where the servants are?”\n“The highprince,” Moash said, nodding to Dalinar. “Brightlord Dalinar\nsent a couple of the men to the servants’ quarters to move everyone out. He\nthought that if the assassin came back, he might start killing\nindiscriminately. Figured the more people who left the palace, the fewer\ncasualties there would be.”\nKaladin nodded, taking a sphere lamp and moving out into the hallway.\n“Hold here. I need to do something.”\n* * *\nAdolin slumped in his seat as the bridgeboy left. Kaladin gave no\nexplanation, of course, and didn’t ask the king for permission to withdraw.\nStorming man seemed to consider himself above lighteyes. No, the\nstorming man seemed to consider himself above the king.\nHe did fight alongside you, part of him said. How many men, lighteyed\nor dark, would stand so firm against a Shardbearer?\nTroubled, Adolin stared up at the ceiling. He couldn’t have seen what he\nthought he had. He’d been dazed from his fall from the ceiling. Surely the\nassassin hadn’t actually cut Kaladin through the arm with his Shardblade.\nThe arm seemed perfectly fine now, after all.\nBut why was the sleeve missing?\nHe fell with the assassin, Adolin thought. He fought, and looked like he\nwas wounded, but it turns out he wasn’t. Could this all be part of some ruse?\nStop it, Adolin thought at himself. You’ll get as paranoid as Elhokar. He"

Elhokar walked\ntoward his bedroom, where there would be more waiting for him, and\npulled open the door.\nNavani gasped, causing the king to freeze in place. He turned toward\nthe door. The back side of the wood had been scratched with a knife, jagged\nlines forming a series of glyphs.\nAdolin stood up. Several of those were numbers, weren’t they?\n“Thirty-eight days,” Renarin read. “The end of all nations.”\n* * *\nKaladin moved tiredly through the palace hallways, retracing the route\nhe’d led them along only a short time before. Down toward the kitchens,\ninto the hallway with the hole cut out into the air. Past the place where\nDalinar’s blood spotted the floor, to the intersection.\nWhere Beld’s corpse lay. Kaladin knelt down, rolling the body over. The\neyes were burned out. Above those dead eyes remained the tattoos of\nfreedom that Kaladin had designed.\nKaladin closed his own eyes. I’ve failed you, he thought. The balding,\nsquare-faced man had survived Bridge Four and the rescue of Dalinar’s\narmies. He’d survived Damnation itself, only to fall here, to an assassin\nwith powers he should not have.\nKaladin groaned.\n“He died protecting.” Syl’s voice.\n“I should be able to keep them alive,” Kaladin said. “Why didn’t I just\nlet them go free? Why did I bring them to this duty, and more death?”\n“Someone has to fight. Someone has to protect.”\n“They’ve done enough! They’ve bled their share. I should banish them\nall. Dalinar can find different bodyguards.”\n“They made the choice,” Syl said. “You can’t take that from them.”\nKaladin knelt, struggling with his grief.\nYou have to learn when to care, son. His father’s voice. And when to let\ngo. You’ll grow calluses.\nHe never had. Storm him, he never had. It was why he’d never made a\ngood surgeon. He couldn’t lose patients.\nAnd now, now he killed? Now he was a soldier? How did that make any\nsense? He hated how good he was at killing.\nHe took a deep breath, regaining control, with effort. “He can do things\nI can’t,” he finally said, opening his eyes and looking toward Syl, who\nstood in the air near him. “The assassin. Is it because I have more Words to\nspeak?”\n“There are more,” Syl said. “You’re not ready for them yet, I don’t\nthink. Regardless, I think you could already do what he does. With\npractice.”\n“But how is he Surgebinding? You said that the assassin had no spren.”\n“No honorspren would give that creature the means to slaughter as he\ndoes.”\n“Perspectives can be different among humans,” Kaladin said, trying to\nkeep the emotion from his voice as he turned Beld facedown so he wouldn’t"

You gave me the means to\nslaughter Parshendi.”\n“To protect.”\n“In their eyes, the Parshendi are protecting their kind,” Kaladin said.\n“To them, I’m the aggressor.”\nSyl sat down, wrapping her arms around her knees. “I don’t know.\nMaybe. But no other honorspren are doing what I do. I am the only one who\ndisobeyed. But his Shardblade…”\n“What of it?” Kaladin asked.\n“It was different. Very different.”\n“It looked ordinary to me. Well, as ordinary as a Shardblade can.”\n“It was different,” she repeated. “I feel I should know why. Something\nabout the amount of Light he was consuming…”\nKaladin rose, then walked down the side corridor, holding up his lamp.\nIt bore sapphires, turning the walls blue. The assassin had cut that hole with\nhis Blade, entered the corridor, and killed Beld. But Kaladin had sent two\nmen on ahead.\nYes, another body. Hobber, one of the first men Kaladin had saved in\nBridge Four. Storms take that assassin! Kaladin remembered saving this\nman after he had been left by everyone else to die on the plateau.\nKaladin knelt beside the corpse, rolled it over.\nAnd found it weeping.\n“I… I’m… sorry,” Hobber said, overcome with emotion and barely able\nto speak. “I’m sorry, Kaladin.”\n“Hobber!” Kaladin said. “You’re alive!” Then he noticed that the legs of\nHobber’s uniform had been sliced through at midthigh. Beneath the fabric,\nHobber’s legs were darkened and grey, dead, as Kaladin’s arm had been.\n“I didn’t even see him,” Hobber said. “He cut me down, then stabbed\nBeld straight through. I listened to you fighting. I thought you’d all died.”\n“It’s all right,” Kaladin said. “You’re all right.”\n“I can’t feel my legs,” Hobber said. “They’re gone. I’m no soldier\nanymore, sir. I’m useless now. I—”\n“No,” Kaladin said firmly. “You’re still Bridge Four. You’re always\nBridge Four.” He forced himself to smile. “We’ll just have Rock teach you\nhow to cook. How are you with stew?”\n“Awful, sir,” Hobber said. “I can burn broth.”\n“Then you’ll fit right in with most military cooks. Come on, let’s get\nyou back to the others.” Kaladin strained, getting his arms under Hobber,\ntrying to lift him.\nHis body would have none of it. He let out an involuntary groan, putting\nHobber back down.\n“It’s all right, sir,” Hobber said.\n“No,” Kaladin said, sucking in the Light of one of the spheres in the\nlamp. “It’s not.” He heaved again, lifting Hobber, then carried him back\ntoward the others.\n34.

A strife even he must\nrequite.\nFrom the Listener Song of Secrets, final\nstanza\nHighprince Valam might be dead, Brightness Tyn, the spanreed wrote.\nOur informants are uncertain. He was never in the best of health, and now\nthere are rumors that his illness finally overcame him. His forces are\ngearing up to seize Vedenar, however, so if he’s dead, his bastard son is\nlikely pretending he is not.\nShallan sat back, though the reed continued writing. It moved seemingly\nof its own volition, paired to an identical reed used by Tyn’s associate\nsomewhere in Tashikk. They’d set up regular camp following the\nhighstorm, Shallan joining Tyn in her magnificent tent. The air still smelled\nof rain, and the floor of the tent let some water leak through, wetting Tyn’s\nrug. Shallan wished she’d worn her oversized boots instead of slippers.\nWhat would it mean for her family if the highprince was dead? He had\nbeen one of her father’s main problems in the latter days of his life, and her\nhouse had gone into debt securing allies to win the highprince’s ear or\nperhaps—instead—to try to unseat him. A succession war could pressure\nthe people who held her family’s debts, and that might make them come to\nher brothers demanding payments. Or, instead, the chaos could cause the\ncreditors to forget about Shallan’s brothers and their insignificant house.\nAnd what of the Ghostbloods? Would the succession war make them more\nor less likely to come, demanding their Soulcaster?\nStormfather! She needed more information.\nThe reed continued to move, listing the names of those who were\nmaking a play for the throne of Jah Keved. “Do you know any of these\npeople personally?” Tyn asked, arms crossed contemplatively as she stood\nbeside the writing table. “What’s happening might offer us some\nopportunities.”\n“I wasn’t important enough for those types,” Shallan said with a\ngrimace. It was true.\n“We might want to make our way to Jah Keved, regardless,” Tyn said.\n“You know the culture, the people. That’ll be useful.”\n“It’s a war zone!”\n“War means desperation, and desperation is our mother’s milk, kid.\nOnce we follow your lead at the Shattered Plains—maybe pick up another\nmember or two for our team—we probably will want to go visit your\nhomeland.”\nShallan felt an immediate stab of guilt. From what Tyn said, the stories\nshe told, it had become clear that she often chose to have someone like\nShallan under her wing. An acolyte, someone to nurture. Shallan suspected\nthat was at least partly because Tyn liked having someone around to\nimpress.\nHer life must be so lonely, Shallan thought. Always moving, always"

Pattern, though\nShallan only noticed him because she knew what to look for. He could be\npractically invisible when he wanted to be, though unlike some spren he\ncould not vanish completely.\nThe spanreed continued to write, giving Tyn a longer rundown of\nconditions in various countries. After that, it produced a curious statement.\nI have checked with informants at the Shattered Plains, the pen wrote.\nThe ones you asked after are, indeed, wanted men. Most are former\nmembers of the army of Highprince Sadeas. He is not forgiving of deserters.\n“What’s this?” Shallan asked, rising from her stool and going to look\nmore closely at what the pen wrote.\n“I implied earlier we’d have to discuss this,” Tyn said, changing the\npaper for the spanreed. “As I keep explaining, the life we lead requires\ndoing some harsh things.”\nThe leader, whom you call Vathah, is worth a bounty of four emerald\nbroams, the pen wrote. The rest, two broams each.\n“Bounty?” Shallan demanded. “I gave promises to these men!”\n“Hush!” Tyn said. “We’re not alone in this camp, fool child. If you want\nus dead, all you need to do is let them overhear this conversation.”\n“We’re not turning them in for money,” Shallan said more softly. “Tyn, I\ngave my word.”\n“Your word?” Tyn said, laughing. “Kid, what do you think we are? Your\nword?”\nShallan blushed. On the table, the spanreed continued to write, oblivious\nto the fact they weren’t paying attention. It was saying something about a\njob Tyn had done before.\n“Tyn,” Shallan said, “Vathah and his men can be useful.”\nTyn shook her head, walking over to the side of the tent, pouring herself\na cup of wine. “You should be proud of what you did here. You have barely\nany experience, yet you took over three separate groups, convincing them\nto put you—practically sphereless and completely without authority—in\ncharge. Brilliant!\n“But here’s the thing. The lies we tell, the dreams we create, they’re not\nreal. We can’t let them be real. This might be the hardest lesson you have to\nlearn.” She turned to Shallan, her expression having gone hard, all sense of\nrelaxed playfulness gone. “When a good con woman dies, it’s usually\nbecause she starts believing her own lies. She finds something good and\nwants it to continue. She keeps it going, thinking she can juggle it. One day\nmore, she tells herself. One day more, and then…”\nTyn dropped the cup. It hit the ground, the wine splashing bloodred\nacross the tent floor and Tyn’s rug.\nRed carpet… once it was white…\n“Your rug,” Shallan said, feeling numb.\n“You think I can afford to haul a rug with me when I leave the Shattered"

In truth,\nVathah and his men probably did deserve their punishments.\nThat didn’t mean Shallan was going to betray them. She had told them\nthey could change. She had given her word.\nLies…\nJust because you learned how to lie didn’t mean you had to let the lie\nrule you. But how could she protect Vathah without alienating Tyn? Did she\neven have that option?\nWhat would Tyn do when Shallan proved to actually be the woman\nbetrothed to Dalinar Kholin’s son?\nHow long did you think you could keep this lie going…\n“Here now,” Tyn said, smiling broadly. “That’s some good news.”\nShallan shook herself from her ruminations, glancing at what the\nspanreed had been writing.\nIn regards to your mission in Amydlatn, it read, our benefactors have\nwritten to say that they are pleased. They do want to know if you recovered\nthe information, but I think this is secondary to them. They let slip that\nthey’ve found the information they need elsewhere, something about a city\nthey’ve been researching.\nFor your part, there is no news of the target surviving. It seems that\nyour worry about the mission’s failure is unfounded. Whatever happened\naboard the ship, it worked to our favor. The Wind’s Pleasure is reported lost\nwith all hands. Jasnah Kholin is dead.\nJasnah Kholin is dead.\nShallan gaped, jaw dropping. That… it isn’t…\n“Maybe those idiots did manage to complete the job,” Tyn said,\nsatisfied. “It looks like I’ll be paid after all.”\n“Your mission in Amydlatn,” Shallan whispered. “It was to assassinate\nJasnah Kholin.”\n“Run the operation, at least,” Tyn said, distracted. “Would have gone\nmyself, but can’t stand ships. Those churning seas turn my stomach inside\nout…”\nShallan couldn’t speak. Tyn was an assassin.

Shallan knew next to nothing about\nhow to fight, and in moments she found herself croaking in pain a second\ntime, Tyn’s fist buried in her stomach.\nShallan sank to her knees, tears on her cheeks.

I’m going to have to invite that\nVathah here, then find a way to blame this on him.” Tyn pulled the sword\nfrom its sheath.\nShallan struggled to her knees, then tried to climb to her feet, but her\nlegs were unsteady and the room lurched around her, as if she were still on\nthe ship.\n“Pattern?” she croaked. “Pattern?”\nShe heard something outside. Shouts?\n“I’m sorry,” Tyn said, voice cold. “I’m going to have to tie this up tight.\nIn a way, I’m proud of you. You fooled me. You’d have been good at this.”\nCalm, Shallan told herself. Be calm!\nTen heartbeats.\nBut for her, it didn’t have to be ten, did it?\nNo. It must be. Time, I need time!\nShe had spheres in her sleeve. As Tyn approached, Shallan breathed in\nsharply. Stormlight became a raging tempest inside of her and she raised her\nhand, thrusting out a pulse of Light. She couldn’t form it into anything—she\nstill didn’t know how—but it seemed for a moment to show a rippling\nimage of Shallan, standing proudly like a woman of the court.\nTyn stopped short at the sight of the projection of light and color, then\nwaved her sword out in front of her. The Light rippled, dissipating into\nsmoky trails.\n“So I’m going mad,” Tyn said. “Hearing voices. Seeing things. I guess\npart of me doesn’t want to do this.” She advanced, raising her blade. “I’m\nsorry that you have to learn the lesson this way. Sometimes, we must do\nthings we don’t like, kid. Difficult things.”\nShallan growled, thrusting her hands forward. Mist twisted and writhed\nin her hands as a brilliantly silver Blade formed there, spearing Tyn through\nthe chest. The woman barely had time to gasp in surprise as her eyes burned\nin her skull.\nTyn’s corpse slid back off the weapon, collapsing in a heap.\n“Difficult things,” Shallan growled. “Yes. I believe I told you. I’ve\nlearned that lesson already. Thank you.” She crawled to her feet, wobbling.\nThe tent flap ripped open and Shallan turned, holding up the Shardblade\npoint-first toward the opening. Vathah, Gaz, and a few other soldiers\nstopped there in a jumble, weapons bloodied. They looked from Shallan to\nthe corpse on the floor with its burned-out eyes, then back to Shallan.\nShe felt numb. She wanted to dismiss the Blade, hide it. It was terrible.\nShe did not. She crushed those emotions and hid them deep within. At\nthe moment, she needed something strong to hold to, and the weapon\nserved that purpose. Even if she hated it."

Even if she hated it.\n“Tyn’s soldiers?” Was that her voice, completely cold, purged of\nemotion?\n“Stormfather!” Vathah said, stepping into the tent, hand to his chest as\nhe stared at the Shardblade. “That night, when you pled with us, you could\nhave killed us every one, and the bandits too. You could have done it on\nyour own—”\n“Tyn’s men!” Shallan shouted.\n“Dead, Brightness,” Red said. “We heard… heard a voice. Telling us to\ncome get you, and they wouldn’t let us pass. Then we heard you screaming,\nand—”\n“Was it the voice of the Almighty?” Vathah asked in a whisper.\n“It was my spren,” Shallan said. “That is all you need know. Search this\ntent. This woman was hired to assassinate me.” It was true, after a fashion.\n“There might be records of who hired her. Bring me anything you find with\nwriting on it.”\nAs they swarmed in and set to work, Shallan sat down on the stool\nbeside the table. The spanreed still waited there, hovering, paused at the\nbottom of the page. It needed a new sheet.\nShallan dismissed the Shardblade. “Do not speak of what you saw here\nto the others,” she told Vathah and his men. Though they promised quickly,\nshe doubted that would hold for long. Shardblades were near-mythical\nobjects, and a woman holding one? Rumors would spread. Just what she\nneeded.\nYou’re alive because of that cursed thing, she thought to herself. Again.\nStop complaining.\nShe took the spanreed up and changed the paper, then set it with its\npoint at the corner. After a moment, Tyn’s distant accomplice started writing\nagain.\nYour benefactors on the Amydlatn job wish to meet with you, the pen\nwrote. It seems that the Ghostbloods have something else for you to do.\nWould you like me to arrange a meeting with them in the warcamps?\nThe pen stopped in place, waiting for a response. What had the spanreed\nsaid above? That these people—Tyn’s benefactors, the Ghostbloods—had\nfound the information they sought… information about a city.\nUrithiru. The people who had killed Jasnah, the people who threatened\nher family, were searching for the city too. Shallan stared at the paper and\nits words for an extended moment as Vathah and his men began pulling\nclothing out of Tyn’s trunk, knocking on its sides to find anything hidden.\nWould you like me to arrange a meeting with them…\nShallan took the spanreed, switched the fabrial’s setting, then wrote a\nsingle word.\nYes.\nTHE END OF\nPart Two\nInterludes\nI-5.

She had wanted to send\nsomeone earlier, but the Five had deliberated and complained until Eshonai\nwanted to throttle the lot of them. At least they’d finally agreed to let her\nsend a messenger.\n“Seven days,” Thude said. “The meeting will happen on a neutral\nplateau.”\n“Did you see him?” Eshonai asked, eager. “The Blackthorn?”\nThude shook his head.\n“What of the other one?” Eshonai asked. “The Surgebinder?”\n“No sign of him either.” Thude looked troubled. He looked eastward.\n“You’d better go. I can give you more details after the storm is done.”\nEshonai nodded, resting her hand on her friend’s shoulder. “Thank you.”\n“Good luck,” Thude said to Resolve.\n“To all of us,” she replied as he shut the door, leaving her alone in a\ndark, seemingly empty city. Eshonai checked the stormshield on her back,\nthen took the sphere with Venli’s captive spren from her pocket and attuned\nthe Rhythm of Resolve.\nThe time had come. She ran toward the storm.\nResolve was a stately beat with a steady, rising sense of import and\npower. She left Narak, and reaching the first chasm, she jumped. Only\nwarform had the strength for such leaps; for the workers to reach outer\nplateaus and grow food, they used rope bridges that were pulled back and\nstowed before each storm.\nShe landed in full stride, her footsteps falling to the beat of Resolve.\nThe stormwall appeared in the distance, barely visible in the darkness.\nWinds rose, pushing against her, as if to hold her back. Above, windspren\nzipped and danced in the air. They were heralds of what was to come.\nEshonai jumped two more chasms, then slowed, striding up to the top of\na low hill. The stormwall now dominated the night sky, advancing at a\nterrible pace. The enormous sheet of darkness mingled debris with rain, a\nbanner of water, rock, dust, and fallen plants. Eshonai unhooked the large\nshield on her back.\nFor the listeners, there was a certain romanticism to going out in the\nstorm. Yes, the storms were terrible—but every listener would have to\nspend a number of nights out in them, alone. The songs said that someone\nseeking a new form would be protected. She wasn’t certain if this was fancy\nor fact, but the songs didn’t prevent most listeners from hiding in a cleft of\nrock to avoid the stormwall, then coming out once it had passed.\nEshonai preferred a shield. It felt more like facing the Rider straight on.\nThis one, the soul of the storm, was the one the humans called Stormfather\n—and he was not one of her people’s gods. In fact, the songs named him a\ntraitor—a spren who had chosen to protect humans instead of the listeners.\nStill, her people respected him. He would kill any who did not respect\nhim."

He would kill any who did not respect\nhim.\nShe placed the base of the shield against a ridge of rock on the ground,\nthen turned her shoulder against it, lowered her head, and braced herself\nwith one foot back. Her other hand held the stone with the spren in it. She’d\nhave preferred to wear her Plate, but for some reason having it on interfered\nwith the transformation process.\nShe felt and heard the storm approach. The ground shook, the air roared.\nBits of leaves swept across her in a chill gust, like scouts before an\noncoming army that charged behind, the howling wind its battle cry.\nShe squeezed her eyes shut.\nIt slammed against her.\nDespite her posture and her braced muscles, something cracked against\nthe shield and flipped it away. The wind caught it and ripped it from her\nfingers. She stumbled backward, then threw herself to the ground, shoulder\nto the wind, head ducked.\nThunder beat against her as the raging wind tried to pull her off the\nplateau and toss her into the air. She kept her eyes closed, as all was black\nwithin the storm save for the flashes of lightning. It did not seem to her she\nwas being protected. Her shoulder against the wind, huddling down behind\na hillock, it seemed that the wind was doing its best to destroy her. Rocks\ncrunched against the dark plateau nearby, shaking the ground. All she could\nhear was the roar of wind in her ears, punctuated occasionally by thunder. A\nterrible song without rhythm.\nShe kept Resolve attuned inside of her. She could feel that, at least, even\nif she couldn’t hear.\nRain that fell like arrowheads beat into her body, bouncing off her\nskullplate and her armor. She set her jaw against the deep, bone-chilling\ncold and stayed in place. She had done this many times before, either when\ntransforming or when on the occasional surprise raid against the Alethi. She\ncould survive. She would survive.\nShe focused on the rhythm in her head, clinging to some rocks as the\nwind tried to push her back off the plateau. Demid, Venli’s once-mate, had\nstarted a movement where people who wanted to transform waited inside\nbuildings until the storm had been going for a while. They only stepped out\nonce the initial burst of fury was past. That was risky, as you never knew\nwhen the point of transformation would come.\nEshonai had never tried it. The storms were violent, they were\ndangerous, but they were also things of discovery. Within them, the familiar\nbecame something grand, majestic, and terrible. She did not look forward to\nentering them, but when she had to, she always found the experience\nthrilling.\nShe lifted her head, eyes closed, and put her face to the winds—feeling\nthem blast her, shake her. She felt the rain on her skin. The Rider of Storms\nwas a traitor, yes—but you could not have a traitor who had not originally\nbeen a friend. These storms belonged to her people.

Like that of a heart. The moment had arrived.\nThe storm vanished. Wind, rain, sound… gone. Eshonai stood up,\ndripping wet, her muscles cold, her skin numb. She shook her head,\nspraying water, and looked up into the sky.\nThe face was there. Infinite, expansive. The humans spoke of their\nStormfather, yet they never knew him as a listener did. As wide as the sky\nitself, with eyes full of countless stars. The gemstone in Eshonai’s hand\nburst alight.\nPower, energy. She imagined it coursing through her, energizing her,\nenlivening her. Eshonai threw the gemstone against the ground, smashing it\nand releasing the spren. She worked hard to get the proper feel down, as\nVenli had trained her.\nIS THIS REALLY WHAT YOU WANT? The voice reverberated\nthrough her like crashing thunder.\nThe Rider had spoken to her! That happened in songs, but not…\nnever… She attuned Appreciation, but of course it was the same rhythm\nnow.

In a moment of\npanic, she cast from her mind the preparations that Venli had given her.\n“No!”\nThe spren became a streak of red light and hit her in the chest. Tendrils\nof red spread outward.\nI CANNOT STOP THIS, the Stormfather said. I WOULD SHELTER\nYOU, LITTLE ONE, IF I WERE GIVEN THAT POWER.

I am far, far too old for this.\nHe pulled open his door, revealing the courtyard of the practice grounds\nat night. The air was wet. Oh, right. One of those storms had come, Invested\nto the hilt and looking for a place to stick it all. Cursed things.\nA young man, hand poised to knock, jumped back in surprise from the\nopening door. Kaladin. The bridgeman-turned-bodyguard. The one with that\nspren Zahel could sense always spinning about.\n“You look like death itself,” Zahel snapped at the boy.

A\nnew form, a form of power?\nEshonai strode toward them, marveling at the energy. Tiny, almost\ninvisible lines of red lightning flared from her hand if she made a fist\nquickly. Her marbled skin tone—mostly black, with a slight grain of red\nstreaks—had not changed, but she’d lost the bulky armor of warform.\nInstead, small ridges peeked out through the skin of her arms, which was\nstretched tightly in places. She’d tested the new armor against stones and\nfound it very durable.\nShe had hairstrands again. How long had it been since she’d felt those?\nMore wondrous, she felt focused. No more worries about the fate of her\npeople. She knew what to do.\nVenli pushed to the front of the crowd as Eshonai reached the edge of\nthe chasm. They looked across the void at one another, and Eshonai could\nsee the question on her sister’s lips. It worked?\nEshonai leapt the chasm. She didn’t require the running start that\nwarform used; she crouched down, then threw herself up and into the air.\nThe wind seemed to writhe around her. She shot over the chasm and landed\namong her people, red lines of power running up her legs as she crouched,\nabsorbing the impact of the landing.\nPeople backed away. So clear.

Today, the\nweapon disintegrated almost immediately after leaving his fingers.\nThe long, silvery Blade transmuted to white vapor—holding its shape\nfor just a brief moment, like a smoke ring—before exploding in a puff of\nwrithing white streams. Adolin growled in frustration, pacing back and\nforth on the plateau, hand held out to the side as he resummoned the\nweapon. Ten heartbeats. At times, it felt like an eternity.\nHe wore his Plate without the helm, which sat atop a nearby rock, and\nso his hair blew free in the early morning breeze.

He didn’t want\nto be rational right now.\nHe shook the condensation from his Blade, then twisted and hurled it,\ntransmitting the mental commands that would tell it to hold together. Once\nagain, the weapon shattered to mist moments after it left his fingers. It\ndidn’t even cross half the distance to the rock formation he was aiming for.\nWhat was wrong with him? He’d mastered Blade commands years ago.\nTrue, he hadn’t often practiced throwing his sword—such things were\nforbidden in duels, and he hadn’t ever thought he’d need to use the\nmaneuver. That was before he’d been trapped on the ceiling of a hallway,\nunable to properly engage an assassin.\nAdolin walked to the edge of the plateau, staring out over the uneven\nexpanse of the Shattered Plains. A huddle of three guards watched him\nnearby. Laughable. What would three bridgemen do if the Assassin in White\nreturned?\nKaladin was worth something in the attack, Adolin thought. More than\nyou were. That man had been suspiciously effective.\nRenarin said that Adolin was unfair toward the bridgeman captain, but\nthere was something strange about that man. More than his attitude—the\nway he always acted like by talking to you, he was doing you a favor. The\nway he seemed so decidedly gloomy at everything, angry at the world itself.\nHe was unlikable, plain and simple, but Adolin had known plenty of\nunlikable people."

In ways Adolin couldn’t explain.\nWell, for all that, Kaladin’s men were just doing their duty. No use in\nsnapping at them, so he gave them a smile.\nAdolin’s Shardblade dropped into his fingers again, too light for its size.\nHe had always felt a certain strength when holding it. Never before had\nAdolin felt powerless when bearing his Shards. Even surrounded by the\nParshendi, even certain he was going to die, he’d still felt power.\nWhere was that feeling now?\nHe spun and threw the weapon, focusing as Zahel had taught him years\nbefore, sending a direct instruction to the Blade—picturing what he needed\nit to do. It held together, spinning end over end, flashing in the air. It sank\nup to its hilt into the stone of the rock formation. Adolin let out the breath\nhe had been holding. Finally. He released the Blade, and it burst into mist,\nwhich streamed like a tiny river from the hole left behind.\n“Come,” he said to his bodyguards, snatching his helm from the rock\nand walking toward the nearby warcamp. As one might expect, the crater\nedge that formed the warcamp wall was most weathered here, in the east.\nThe camp had spilled out like the contents of a broken turtle egg, and—over\nthe years—had even started to creep down onto the near plateaus.\nEmerging from that creep of civilization was a distinctly odd\nprocession. The congregation of robed ardents chanted in unison,\nsurrounding parshmen who carried large poles upright like lances. Silk\ncloth shimmered between these poles, a good forty feet wide, rippling in the\nbreeze and cutting off the view of something in the center.\nSoulcasters? They didn’t normally come out during the day. “Wait\nhere,” he told his bodyguards, then jogged over toward the ardents.\nThe three bridgemen obeyed. If Kaladin had been with them, he would\nhave insisted on following. Maybe the way the fellow acted was a result of\nhis strange position. Why had father put a darkeyed soldier outside the\ncommand structure? Adolin was all for treating men with respect and honor\nregardless of eye shade, but the Almighty had put some men in command\nand others beneath them. It was simply the natural order of things.\nThe parshmen carrying the poles watched him come, then looked down\nat the ground. Nearby ardents let Adolin pass, though they looked\nuncomfortable. Adolin was allowed to see Soulcasters, but having him visit\nthem was irregular.\nInside the temporary silk room, Adolin found Kadash—one of the\nforemost of Dalinar’s ardents. The tall man had once been a soldier, as the\nscars on his head testified. He spoke with ardents in bloodred robes.\nSoulcasters. It was the word for both the people who performed the art\nand the fabrials they used. Kadash was not one himself; he wore the\nstandard grey robes instead of red, his head shaven, face accented by a\nsquare beard. He noticed Adolin, hesitated briefly, then bowed his head in"

Like all of the ardents, Kadash was technically a slave.\nThat included the five Soulcasters. Each stood with right hand to breast,\ndisplaying a sparkling fabrial across the back of the palm. One of the\nardents glanced at Adolin. Stormfather—that gaze wasn’t completely\nhuman, not any longer. Prolonged use of the Soulcaster had transformed the\neyes so that they sparkled like gemstones themselves. The woman’s skin\nhad hardened to something like stone, smooth, with fine cracks. It was as if\nthe person were a living statue.\nKadash hustled over toward Adolin. “Brightlord,” he said. “I had not\nrealized you were coming to supervise.”\n“I’m not here to supervise,” Adolin said, glancing with discomfort at the\nSoulcasters. “I’m just surprised. Don’t you usually do this at night?”\n“We can’t afford to any longer, bright one,” Kadash said. “There are too\nmany demands upon the Soulcasters. Buildings, food, removal of waste…\nTo fit it all in, we are going to need to start training multiple ardents on each\nfabrial, then working them in shifts. Your father approved this earlier in the\nweek.”\nThis drew glances from several of the red-robed ardents. What did they\nthink about others training on their fabrials? Their almost-alien expressions\nwere unreadable.\n“I see,” Adolin said. Storms, we rely on these things a lot. Everyone\ntalked about Shardblades and Shardplate, and their advantages in war. But\nin truth, it was these strange fabrials—and the grain they created—that had\nallowed this war to proceed as it had.\n“May we proceed, bright one?” Kadash asked.\nAdolin nodded, and Kadash walked back to the five and gave a few\nbrief commands. He spoke quickly, nervous. It was odd to see that in\nKadash, who was normally so placid and unflappable. Soulcasters had that\neffect on everyone.\nThe five started softly chanting, a harmony to the singing of the ardents\noutside. The five stepped forward and raised their hands in a line, and\nAdolin found his face breaking out in a sweat, blown cold by the wind that\nmanaged to sneak past the silken walls.\nAt first there was nothing. And then stone.\nAdolin thought he caught a brief glimpse of mist coalescing—like the\nmoment a Shardblade appeared—as a massive wall sprang into existence.\nWind blew inward, as if sucked by that materializing rock, making the cloth\nflap violently, snapping and writhing in the air. Why should the wind pull\ninward? Shouldn’t it have been blown outward by rock displacing it?\nThe large barrier abutted the cloth on either side, causing the silk\nscreens to bulge outward, and rose high into the air.\n“We’ll need taller poles,” Kadash muttered to himself.\nThe stone wall had the same utilitarian look as the barracks, but this was\na new shape. Flat on the side facing the warcamps, it was sloped on the\nother side, like a wedge. Adolin recognized it as something his father had"

Adolin recognized it as something his father had\nbeen deliberating building for months now.\n“A windbreak!” Adolin said. “That’s wonderful, Kadash.”\n“Yes, well, your father seemed to like the proposal. A few dozen of\nthese out here, and the construction yards will be able to expand onto the\nentire plateau without fear of highstorms.”\nThat wasn’t completely true. You always had to worry about highstorms,\nsince they could hurl boulders and blow hard enough to rip buildings from\ntheir foundations. But a good solid windbreak would be a blessing of the\nAlmighty out here in the stormlands.\nThe Soulcasters retreated, not speaking with the other ardents. The\nparshmen scrambled to keep up, those on one side of the barrier running\nalong behind it with their silk and opening the back of the room to let the\nnew windbreak slip out of the enclosure. They passed by Adolin and\nKadash, leaving them exposed on the plateau and standing in the shade of\nthe large new stone structure.\nThe silk wall went back up, blocking sight of the Soulcasters. Just\nbefore it did, Adolin noticed one of the Soulcasters’ hands. The fabrial’s\nglow was gone. Likely one or more of the gemstones in it had shattered.\n“I still find it incredible,” Kadash said, looking up at the stone barrier.\n“Even after all these years. If we needed proof of the Almighty’s hand in\nour lives, this is certainly it.” A few gloryspren appeared around him,\nspinning and golden.\n“The Radiants could Soulcast,” Adolin said, “couldn’t they?”\n“It is written that they could,” Kadash said carefully. The Recreance—\nthe term for the Radiants’ betrayal of mankind—was often seen as a failure\nof Vorinism as a religion. The way the Church sought to seize power in the\ncenturies that followed was even more embarrassing.\n“What else could the Radiants do?” Adolin asked. “They had strange\npowers, right?”\n“I have not read on it extensively, bright one,” Kadash said. “Perhaps I\nshould have spent more time learning about them, if only to remember the\nevils of pride. I will be certain to do this, bright one, in order to remain\nfaithful and remember the proper place of all ardents.”\n“Kadash,” Adolin said, watching the shimmering silken procession\nretreat, “I need information right now, not humility. The Assassin in White\nhas returned.”\nKadash gasped. “The disturbance at the palace last night? The rumors\nare true?”\n“Yes.”\nThere was no use hiding it. His father and the king had told the\nhighprinces, and were planning on how to release the information to\neveryone else.\nAdolin met the ardent’s eyes. “That assassin walked on the walls, as if\nthe pull of the earth were nothing to him. He fell a hundred feet without\ninjury. He was like a Voidbringer, death given form. So I ask you again.\nWhat could the Radiants do? Were abilities like these ascribed to them?”\n“Those and more, bright one,” Kadash whispered, face drained of color."

I thought the things they claimed to have seen\nthe result of trauma—”\n“I need to know,” Adolin said. “Look into it. Read. Tell me what this\ncreature might be capable of doing. We have to know how to fight him. He\nwill return.”\n“Yes,” Kadash said, visibly shaken. “But… Adolin? If what you say is\ntrue… Storms! It could mean the Radiants are not dead.”\n“I know.”\n“Almighty preserve us,” Kadash whispered.\n* * *\nNavani Kholin loved warcamps. In ordinary cities, everything was so\nmessy. Shops where they hardly belonged, streets that refused to run in\nstraight lines.\nMilitary men and women, however, valued order and rationality—at\nleast, the better ones did. Their camps reflected that. Barracks in neat rows,\nshops confined to marketplaces, as opposed to popping up on every corner.\nFrom her vantage atop her observation tower, she could see much of\nDalinar’s camp. So neat, so intentional.\nThis was the mark of humankind: to take the wild, unorganized world\nand make something logical of it. You could get so much more done when\neverything was in its place, when you could easily find what or whom you\nneeded. Creativity required such things.\nCareful planning was, indeed, the water that nourished innovation.\nShe took in a deep breath and turned back toward the engineering\ngrounds, which dominated the eastern section of Dalinar’s warcamp. “All\nright, everyone!” she called. “Let’s give it a try!” This test had been planned\nlong before the assassin’s attack, and she’d decided to proceed. What else\nwas she going to do? Sit around and worry?\nThe grounds below became a buzz of activity. Her elevated observation\nplatform was perhaps twenty-five feet high, and gave her a good view of\nthe engineering grounds. She was flanked by a dozen different ardents and\nscholars—and even Matain and a few other stormwardens. She still wasn’t\nsure what she thought of those fellows—they spent too much time talking\nabout numerology and reading the winds. They called it a science in an\nattempt to dodge Vorin prohibitions of predicting the future.\nThey had offered some useful wisdom from time to time. She’d invited\nthem for that reason—and because she wanted to keep an eye on them.\nThe object of her attention, and the subject of today’s test, was a large\ncircular platform at the center of the engineering yards. The wooden\nstructure looked like the top of a siege tower that had been cut off and laid\non the ground. Crenellations ringed it, and they’d set up dummies at those,\nthe kinds that the soldiers used for archery practice. Next to that grounded\nplatform was a tall wooden tower with a latticework of scaffolding up the\nsides. Workers scuttled over it, checking that everything was operational.\n“You really should read this, Navani,” Rushu said, looking over a\nreport.

The young woman was an ardent, and had no right whatsoever to\nhave such lush eyelashes or delicate features. Rushu had joined the ardentia\nto escape the advances of men. A silly choice, judging by the way male\nardents always wanted to work with her. Fortunately, she was also brilliant.\nAnd Navani could always find a use for someone brilliant.\n“I’ll read it later,” Navani said in a gently chiding voice. “We have work\nto do now, Rushu.”\n“… changed even when he was in the other room,” Rushu mumbled,\nflipping to another page. “Repeatable and measurable. Only flamespren so\nfar, but so many potential other applications…”\n“Rushu,” Navani said, a little more firmly this time. “The test?”\n“Oh! Sorry, Brightness.” The woman tucked the folded pages into a\npocket of her robes. Then she ran her hand across her shaved head,\nfrowning. “Navani, have you ever wondered why the Almighty gave beards\nto men, but not women? For that matter, why do we consider it feminine for\na woman to have long hair? Should not more hair be a masculine trait?\nMany of them have quite a lot of it, you see.”\n“Focus, child,” Navani said. “I want you watching when the test\nhappens.” She turned to the others. “That goes for all of you. If this thing\ncrashes to the ground again, I don’t want to lose another week attempting to\nfigure out what went wrong!”\nThe others nodded, and Navani found herself growing excited, some of\nthe tension from the night’s attack finally bleeding away. She went over the\nprotocols for the test in her head. People moved out of danger… Ardents on\nvarious platforms nearby, watching intently with quills and paper to\nrecord… Stones infused…\nEverything had been done and checked three times over. She stepped up\nto the front of her platform—holding the railing tightly with freehand and\ngloved safehand—and blessed the Almighty for the distracting power of a\ngood fabrial project. She’d used this one at first to divert herself from\nworrying about Jasnah, though she’d eventually realized that Jasnah would\nbe fine. True, reports now said the ship had been lost with all hands, but this\nwasn’t the first time that supposed disaster had struck Navani’s daughter.\nJasnah played with danger as a child played with a captive cremling, and\nshe always came through.\nThe assassin’s return, though… Oh, Stormfather. If he took Dalinar as\nhe had Gavilar…\n“Give the signal,” she said to the ardents. “We’ve checked everything\nmore times than is useful.”\nThe ardents nodded and wrote, via spanreed, to the workers below.\nNavani noticed with annoyance that a figure in blue Shardplate had\nwandered onto the engineering grounds, helm under arm, exposing a messy\nmop of blond hair speckled black. The guards were supposed to have kept\npeople out, but such prohibitions would not apply to the highprince’s heir.\nWell, Adolin would know to keep his distance.

Ardents at the top had activated\nthe fabrials there, and now climbed down the ladders at the sides,\nunhooking latches as they went. Once they were down, workers carefully\npulled the sides away on their rollers. Those were the only things that had\nbeen holding the top of the tower in place. Without them, it should fall.\nThe top of the platform, however, remained in place—hanging\nimpossibly in the air. Navani’s breath caught. The only thing connecting it\nto the ground was a set of two pulleys and ropes, but those offered no\nsupport. That square, thick section of wood now hung in the air completely\nunsupported.\nThe ardents around her murmured in excitement. Now for the real test.\nNavani waved, and the men below worked the cranks on the pulleys,\npulling down the floating section of wood. The archer parapet nearby\nshook, wobbled, then began to rise into the air in a motion exactly opposite\nto the square’s.\n“It’s working!” Rushu exclaimed.\n“I don’t like that wobble,” said Falilar. The ancient engineer scratched\nat his ardent’s beard. “That ascent should be smoother.”\n“It’s not falling,” Navani said. “I’ll settle for that.”\n“Winds willing, I’d have been up there,” Rushu said, raising a spyglass.\n“I can’t see even a sparkle from the gemstones. What if they’re cracking?”\n“Then we’ll find out eventually,” Navani said, though in truth she\nwouldn’t have minded being on top of the rising parapet herself. Dalinar\nwould have had a heart attack if he’d learned of her doing such a thing. The\nman was a dear, but he was a touch overprotective. In the way a highstorm\nwas a touch windy.\nThe parapet wobbled its way upward. It acted as if it were being\nhoisted, though it had no support at all. Finally, it peaked. The square of\nwood that had been hanging in the air before was now down against the\nground and tied in place. The round parapet hung in the air instead, slightly\noff-kilter.\nIt did not fall.\nAdolin clomped up the steps to her viewing platform, rattling and\nshaking the entire thing with that Shardplate of his. By the time he reached\nher, the other scholars were chattering among themselves and furiously\nmaking notes. Logicspren, in the shape of tiny stormclouds, rose around\nthem.\nIt had worked. Finally.\n“Hey,” Adolin said. “Is that platform flying?”\n“And you only just now noticed this, dear?” Navani asked.\nHe scratched his head. “I’ve been distracted, Aunt. Huh. That… That’s\nreally odd.” He seemed troubled.\n“What?” Navani asked him.\n“It’s, it’s like…”\nHim. The assassin, who had—according to both Adolin and Dalinar—\nsomehow manipulated gravityspren.\nNavani looked to the scholars. “Why don’t you all go down and have\nthem lower the platform? You can inspect the gemstones and see if any\nbroke.”"

Alone, please.” Sometimes, working\nwith scholars, you had to be a touch blunt.\nRushu finally blushed, then bobbed a bow and hastened away. Adolin\nstepped up to the railing. It was difficult to not feel dwarfed by a man\nwearing Plate, and when he reached out to hold the railing, she thought she\ncould hear the wood groan from the strength of that grip. He could have\nsnapped that rail without a second thought.\nI will figure out how to make more of that, she thought. While she was\nno warrior, there might be things she could do to protect her family. The\nmore she understood the secrets of technology and the power of spren\nlocked within gemstones, the closer she grew to finding what she sought.\nAdolin was staring at her hand. Oh, so he’d finally noticed that, had he?\n“Aunt?” he said, voice strained. “A glove?”\n“Far more practical,” she said, holding up her safehand and wiggling the\nfingers. “Oh, don’t look like that. Darkeyed women do it all the time.”\n“You’re not darkeyed.”\n“I’m the dowager queen,” Navani said. “Nobody cares what in\nDamnation I do. I could prance around completely nude, and they’d all just\nshake their heads and talk about how eccentric I am.”\nAdolin sighed, but let the matter drop, instead nodding toward the\nplatform. “How did you do it?”\n“Conjoined fabrials,” Navani said. “The trick was finding a way to\novercome the structural weaknesses of the gemstones, which succumb\neasily to the multiplied strain of simultaneous infusion drain and physical\nstress. We…”\nShe trailed off as she caught Adolin’s eyes glazing over. He was a bright\nyoung man when it came to most social interactions, but he didn’t have a\nsingle scholarly breath in him. Navani smiled, switching to layman’s terms.\n“If you split a fabrial gemstone in a certain way,” Navani said, “you can\nlink the two pieces together so they mimic each other’s motions. Like a\nspanreed?”\n“Ah, right,” Adolin said.\n“Well,” Navani said, “we can also make two halves that move opposite\none another. We filled the floor of that parapet with such gemstones and put\ntheir other halves in the wooden square. Once we engage them all—so they\nare mimicking one another in reverse—we can pull one platform down and\nmake the other go up.”\n“Huh,” Adolin said. “Can you make this work on a battlefield?”\nThat was, of course, the exact thing Dalinar had asked when she’d\nshown him the concepts. “Proximity is a problem right now,” she said. “The\nfarther the pairs grow from one another, the weaker their interaction, and"

You could roll one of these out there, then engage it and write back to\nus via reed. We pull the platform here down, and your archers get raised up\nfifty feet to gain a perfect archery position.”\nThis, finally, seemed to get Adolin excited. “The enemy wouldn’t be\nable to topple it or climb it! Stormfather. The tactical advantage!”\n“Exactly.”\n“You don’t sound enthusiastic.”\n“I am, dear,” Navani said. “But this isn’t the most ambitious idea we’ve\nhad for this technique. Not by a faint breeze or a stormwind.”\nHe frowned at her.\n“It’s all very technical and theoretical right now,” Navani said, smiling.\n“But just wait. When you see the things the ardents are imagining—”\n“Not you?” Adolin asked.\n“I’m their patron, dear,” Navani said, patting him on the arm. “I don’t\nhave time to make all of the diagrams and figures, even were I up to the\ntask.” She looked down at the gathered ardents and women scientists who\nwere inspecting the floor of the parapet platform. “They suffer me.”\n“Surely it’s more than that.”\nPerhaps in another life it could have been. She was sure some of them\nsaw her as a colleague. Many, however, just saw her as the woman who\nsponsored them so she’d have new fabrials to show off at parties. Perhaps\nshe was just that. A lighteyed lady of rank had to have some hobbies, didn’t\nshe?\n“I assume you’re here to escort me to the meeting?” The highprinces,\nabuzz about the assassin’s attack, had demanded that Elhokar meet with\nthem today.\nAdolin nodded, twitching and glancing over his shoulder as he heard a\nnoise, instinctively stepping protectively to put himself between Navani and\nwhatever it was. The noise, however, was just some workers taking the side\noff one of Dalinar’s massive rolling bridges. Those were the main purpose\nof these grounds; she’d merely appropriated the area for her test.\nShe held her arm out to him. “You’re as bad as your father.”\n“Perhaps I am,” he said, taking her arm. That Plated hand of his might\nhave made some women uncomfortable, but she’d been around Plate far, far\nmore often than most.\nThey started down the wide steps together. “Aunt,” he said. “Have you\nbeen, uh, doing anything to encourage my father’s advances? Between you\ntwo, I mean.” For a boy who spent half his life flirting with anything in a\ndress, he certainly did blush a lot when he said that.\n“Encourage him?” Navani said. “I did more than that, child. I\npractically had to seduce the man. Your father is certainly stubborn.”\n“I hadn’t noticed,” Adolin said dryly. “You realize how much more\ndifficult you’ve made his position?

She was not the same frightened girl who had\nsuffered the storms of a broken home. She was not the same naive woman\nwho had tried to steal from Jasnah Kholin. She was not the same woman\nwho had been deceived by Kabsal and then Tyn.\nThat did not mean she was not still frightened or naive. She was both.\nBut she was also tired. Tired of being shoved around, tired of being misled,\ntired of being dismissed. During the trip with Tvlakv, she’d pretended she\ncould lead and take charge. She no longer felt the need to pretend.\nShe knelt beside one of Tyn’s trunks. She’d resisted letting the men\nbreak it open—she wanted a few trunks for keeping clothing—but her\nsearch of the tent hadn’t found the proper key.\n“Pattern,” she said. “Can you look inside of this? Squeeze in through\nthe keyhole?”\n“Mmm…” Pattern moved onto the side of the trunk, then shrank down\nto be the size of her thumbnail. He moved in easily. She heard his voice\nfrom inside. “Dark.”\n“Drat,” she said, fishing out a sphere and holding it up to the keyhole.\n“Does that help?”\n“I see a pattern,” he said.\n“A pattern? What kind of—”\nClick."

What kind of—”\nClick.\nShallan started, then reached to lift the lid of the trunk. Pattern buzzed\nhappily inside.\n“You unlocked it.”\n“A pattern,” he said happily.\n“You can move things?”\n“Push a little here and there,” he said. “Very little strength on this side.\nMmm…”\nThe trunk was filled with clothing and had a pouch of spheres in a black\ncloth bag. Both would be very useful. Shallan searched through and found a\ndress with fine embroidery and a modern cut. Tyn needed it, of course, for\ntimes when she pretended to be of a higher status. Shallan put it on, found it\nloose through the bust but otherwise acceptable, then did her face and hair\nat the mirror using the dead woman’s makeup and brushes.\nWhen she left the tent that morning, she felt—for the first time in what\nseemed ages—like a true lighteyed woman. That was well, for today she\nwould finally reach the Shattered Plains. And, hopefully, destiny.\nShe strode out into the morning light. Her men worked alongside the\ncaravan’s parshmen to break down camp. With Tyn’s guards dead, the only\narmed force in the camp belonged to Shallan.\nVathah fell into step beside her. “We burned the bodies last night as you\ninstructed, Brightness. And another guard patrol stopped by this morning\nwhile you were getting ready. They obviously wanted us to know that they\nintend to keep the peace. If someone camps in this spot and finds the bones\nof Tyn and her soldiers in the ashes, it could lead to questions. I don’t know\nthat the caravan workers will keep your secret if asked.”\n“Thank you,” Shallan said. “Have one of the men gather the bones into\na sack. I’ll deal with them.”\nHad she really just said that?\nVathah nodded curtly, as if this were the expected answer. “Some of the\nmen are uncomfortable, now that we’re so close to the warcamps.”\n“Do you still think I’m incapable of keeping my promises to them?”\nHe actually smiled. “No. I think I’ve been right convinced, Brightness.”\n“Well then?”\n“I’ll reassure them,” he said.\n“Excellent.” They parted ways as Shallan sought out Macob. When she\nfound him, the bearded, aging caravan trademaster bowed to her with far\nmore respect than he’d ever shown her before. He’d already heard about the\nShardblade.\n“I will need one of your men to run down to the warcamps and find me\na palanquin,” Shallan said. “Sending one of my soldiers is currently\nimpossible.” She wouldn’t risk them being recognized and imprisoned.\n“Certainly,” Macob said, voice stiff. “The price will be…”\nShe gave him a pointed stare.\n“… paid out of my own purse, as thanks to you for a safe arrival.” He\nput an odd emphasis on the word safe, as if it were of questionable merit in\nthe sentence.\n“And the price for your discretion?” Shallan asked.\n“My discretion can always be assured, Brightness,” the man said. “And"

With that, I bid you farewell. I hope\nit is not insulting for me to say, Brightness, that I hope we never meet\nagain.”\n“Then our views in that regard are in agreement.”\nHe nodded to her and tapped his chull. The wagon rolled away.\n“I listened to them last night,” Pattern said with a buzzing, excited voice\nfrom the back of her dress. “Is nonexistence really such a fascinating\nconcept to humans?”\n“They spoke of death, did they?” Shallan asked.\n“They kept wondering if you would ‘come for them.’ I realize that\nnonexistence is not something to look forward to, but they talked on, and\non, and on about it. Fascinating indeed.”\n“Well, keep your ears open, Pattern. I suspect this day is going to only\nget more interesting.” She walked back toward the tent.\n“But, I don’t have ears,” he said. “Ah yes. A metaphor? Such delicious\nlies. I will remember that idiom.”\n* * *\nThe Alethi warcamps were so much more than Shallan had expected\nthem to be. Ten compact cities in a row, each casting up smoke from\nthousands of fires. Lines of caravans streamed in and out, passing the crater\nrims that made up their walls. Each camp flew hundreds of banners\nproclaiming the presence of high-ranked lighteyes.\nAs the palanquin carried her down a slope, she was truly stunned at the\nmagnitude of the population. Stormfather! She’d once considered the\nregional fair on her father’s lands to be a huge gathering. How many\nmouths were there to feed down below? How much water did they require\nfrom each highstorm?\nHer palanquin lurched. She’d left the wagon behind; the chulls belonged\nto Macob. She’d try to sell the wagon, if it remained when she sent her men\nfor it later. For now, she rode the palanquin, which was carried by parshmen\nunder the watchful eyes of a lighteyed man who owned them and rented out\nthe vehicle. He strolled along ahead. The irony of being carried on the\nbacks of Voidbringers as she entered the warcamps was not lost on her.\nBehind the vehicle marched Vathah and her eighteen guards, then her\nfive slaves, who carried her trunks. She’d dressed them in shoes and\nclothing from the merchants, but you couldn’t cover up months of slavery\nwith a new outfit—and the soldiers weren’t much better. Their uniforms had\nonly been washed when a highstorm hit, and that was more of a douse than\na wash. The occasional whiff she got of them was why she had them\nmarching behind her palanquin.\nShe hoped she wasn’t as bad. She had Tyn’s perfume, but the Alethi\nelite preferred frequent bathing and a clean scent—part of the wisdom of\nthe Heralds. Wash with the coming highstorm, both servant and brightlord,\nto ward away rotspren and purify the body."

Wash with the coming highstorm, both servant and brightlord,\nto ward away rotspren and purify the body.\nShe’d done what she could with some pails of water, but did not have\nthe luxury of stopping to prepare more properly. She needed the protection\nof a highprince, and quickly. Now that she had arrived, the immensity of\nher tasks struck her afresh: Discover what Jasnah had been looking for on\nthe Shattered Plains. Use the information there to persuade the Alethi\nleadership to take measures against the parshmen. Investigate the people\nTyn had been meeting with and… do what? Scam them somehow? Find out\nwhat they knew about Urithiru, deflect their attention away from her\nbrothers, and perhaps find a way to repay them for what they’d done to\nJasnah?\nSo much to do. She would need resources. Dalinar Kholin was her best\nhope for that.\n“But will he take me in?” she whispered.\n“Mmmm?” Pattern said from the seat nearby.\n“I will need him as a patron. If Tyn’s sources know that Jasnah is dead,\nthen Dalinar probably knows as well. How will he react to my unexpected\narrival? Will he take her books, pat me on the head, and send me back to\nJah Keved? The Kholin house has no need of a bond to a minor Veden like\nme. And I… I’m just rambling out loud, aren’t I?”\n“Mmmm,” Pattern said. He sounded drowsy, though she didn’t know if\nspren could get tired.\nHer anxiety grew as her procession approached the warcamps. Tyn had\nbeen adamant that Shallan not ask for Dalinar’s protection, as that would\nmake her beholden to him. Shallan had killed the woman, but she still\nrespected Tyn’s opinion. Was there merit to what she’d said about Dalinar?\nA knock came at her palanquin window. “We’re going to have the\nparshmen put you down for a bit,” Vathah said. “Need to ask around and see\nwhere the highprince is.”\n“Fine.”\nShe waited impatiently. They must have sent the palanquin owner on the\nerrand—Vathah was as nervous as she was at the idea of sending one of his\nmen into the warcamps alone. She eventually heard a muffled conversation\noutside, and Vathah returned, his boots scraping rock. She drew back the\ncurtain, looking up at him.\n“Dalinar Kholin is with the king,” Vathah said. “The whole lot of the\nhighprinces are there.” He looked disturbed as he turned toward the\nwarcamps. “Something’s on the winds, Brightness.” He squinted. “Too\nmany patrols. Lots of soldiers out. The palanquin owner won’t say, but from\nthe sound of it, something happened recently. Something deadly.”\n“Take me to the king, then,” Shallan said.\nVathah raised an eyebrow at her. The king of Alethkar was arguably the\nmost powerful man in the world. “You aren’t going to kill him, are you?”\nVathah asked softly, leaning down.\n“What?”"

He’s a child wearing his father’s clothes, that one is. Everything’s\ngotten worse for Alethkar since he took the throne. But my men, we’d have\na hard time getting away if you did something like that. Hard time indeed.”\n“I will keep my promise.”\nHe nodded, and she let the drapes fall back down over the palanquin\nwindow. Stormfather. Give a woman a Shardblade, get her close… Had\nanyone ever tried that? They must have, though thinking about it made her\nsick.\nThe palanquin turned northward. Passing the warcamps took a long\ntime; they were enormous. Eventually, she peeked out and saw a tall hill to\nthe left with a building sculpted from—and onto—the stone of the top. A\npalace?\nWhat if she did convince Brightlord Dalinar to take her in and trust her\nwith Jasnah’s research? What would she be in Dalinar’s household? A lesser\nscribe, to be tucked aside and ignored? That was how she’d spent most of\nher life. She found herself suddenly, passionately determined not to let it\nhappen again. She needed the freedom and the funding to investigate\nUrithiru and Jasnah’s murder. Shallan would accept nothing else. She could\naccept nothing else.\nSo make it happen, she thought.\nWould that it were so easy as wishing. As the palanquin turned up the\nswitchbacks leading to the palace, her new satchel—from Tyn’s things—\nshook and hit her foot. She picked it up and flipped through the pages\ninside, finding the crinkled sketch of Bluth as she’d imagined him. A hero\ninstead of a slaver.\n“Mmmmm…” Pattern said from the seat beside her.\n“This picture is a lie,” Shallan said.\n“Yes.”\n“And yet it isn’t. This is what he became, at the end. To a small degree.”\n“Yes.”\n“So what is the lie, and what is the truth?”\nPattern hummed softly to himself, like a contented axehound before the\nhearth. Shallan fingered the picture, smoothing it. Then she pulled out a\nsketchpad and a pencil, and started drawing. It was a difficult task in the\nlurching palanquin; this would not be her finest drawing. Still, her fingers\nmoved across the sketch with an intensity she hadn’t felt in weeks.\nBroad lines at first, to fix the image in her head. She wasn’t copying a\nMemory this time. She was searching for something nebulous: a lie that\ncould be real if she could just imagine it correctly.\nShe scratched frantically at the paper, hunkering down, and soon\nstopped feeling the rhythm of the porters’ steps. She saw only the drawing,\nknew only the emotions she bled onto that page. Jasnah’s determination."

A sense of rightness that she could not describe, but\nwhich she drew from her brother Helaran, the best person she’d ever\nknown.\nIt all poured from her into the pencil and onto the page. Streaks and\nlines that became shadows and patterns that became figures and faces. A\nquick sketch, hurried, yet one alive. It depicted Shallan as a confident\nyoung woman standing before Dalinar Kholin, as she imagined him. She’d\nput him in Shardplate as he, and those around him, studied Shallan with\npenetrating consternation. She stood strong, hand raised toward them as she\nspoke with confidence and power. No trembling here. No fear of\nconfrontation.\nThis is what I would have been, Shallan thought, if I had not been raised\nin a household of fear. So this is what I will be today.\nIt wasn’t a lie. It was a different truth.\nA knock came at the palanquin’s door. It had stopped moving; she’d\nbarely noticed. With a nod to herself, she folded the sketch and slipped it\ninto the pocket of her safehand sleeve. Then she stepped out of the vehicle\nand onto cold rock. She felt invigorated, and realized she had sucked in a\ntiny amount of Stormlight without meaning to.\nThe palace was both finer and more mundane than she might have\nexpected. Certainly, this was a warcamp, and so the king’s seat wouldn’t\nmatch the majesty of the royal dwellings of Kharbranth. At the same time, it\nwas amazing that such a structure could have been crafted here, away from\nthe culture and resources of Alethkar proper. The towering stone fortress of\nsculpted rock, several stories high, perched at the pinnacle of the hill.\n“Vathah, Gaz,” she said. “Attend me. The rest of you, take up position\nhere. I will send word.”\nThey saluted her; she wasn’t certain if that was appropriate or not. She\nstrode forward, and noticed with amusement that she’d chosen one of the\ntallest of the deserters and one of the shortest to accompany her, and so\nwhen they flanked her, it created an even slope of height: Vathah, herself,\nGaz. Had she really just chosen her guards based on aesthetic appeal?\nThe front gates of the palace complex faced west, and here Shallan\nfound a large group of guards standing before open doors that led to a deep\ntunnel of a corridor into the hill itself. Sixteen guards at the door? She had\nread that King Elhokar was paranoid, but this seemed excessive.\n“You’ll need to announce me, Vathah,” she said softly as they walked\nup.\n“As?”\n“Brightness Shallan Davar, ward of Jasnah Kholin and causal betrothed\nof Adolin Kholin. Wait to say it until I indicate.”\nThe grizzled man nodded, hand on his axe. Shallan didn’t share his\ndiscomfort. If anything, she was excited.

Several raised hands as if to do so—she saw this from\nthe corner of her eye—but they backed down into silence. Vathah snorted\nsoftly from beside her as they entered the tunnel-like corridor beyond the\ngates.\nThe acoustics caught echoing whispers as the guards at the door\nconversed. Finally, one of them did call out after her. “… Brightness?”\nShe stopped, turning toward them and raising an eyebrow.\n“I’m sorry, Brightness,” the guard called. “But you are… ?”\nShe nodded to Vathah.\n“You don’t recognize Brightness Davar?” he barked. “The causal\nbetrothed of Brightlord Adolin Kholin?”\nThe guards hushed, and Shallan turned around to continue on her way.\nThe conversation behind started up again almost immediately, loud enough\nthis time that she could catch a few words. “… never can keep track of that\nman’s women…”\nThey reached an intersection. Shallan looked one way, then the other.\n“Upward, I’d guess,” she said.\n“Kings do like to be at the top of everything,” Vathah said. “Attitude\nmight get you past the outer door, Brightness, but it’s not going to get you\nin to see Kholin.”\n“Are you really his betrothed?” Gaz asked nervously, scratching at his\neye patch.\n“Last I checked,” Shallan said, leading the way. “Which, granted, was\nbefore my ship sank.” She wasn’t worried about getting in to see Kholin.\nShe’d at least get an audience.\nThey continued upward, asking servants for directions. Those scuttled\nabout in clusters, jumping when spoken to. Shallan recognized that kind of\ntimidity. Was the king as terrible a master as her father had been?\nAs they went higher, the structure seemed less like a fortress and more\nlike a palace. There were reliefs on the walls, mosaics on the floor, carved\nshutters, an increasing number of windows. By the time they approached\nthe king’s conference chamber near the top, wood trim framed the stone\nwalls, with silver and gold leaf worked into the carvings. Lamps held\nmassive sapphires, beyond the size of ordinary denominations, radiating\nbright blue light. At least she wouldn’t lack for Stormlight, should she need\nit.\nThe passage into the king’s conference room was clogged with men.\nSoldiers in a dozen different uniforms.\n“Damnation,” Gaz said. “Those are Sadeas’s colors there.”\n“And Thanadal, and Aladar, and Ruthar…” Vathah said. “He’s meeting\nwith all the highprinces, as I said.”\nShallan could pick out factions easily, dredging from her studies of\nJasnah’s book the names—and heraldry—of all ten highprinces. Sadeas’s\nsoldiers chatted with those of Highprince Ruthar and Highprince Aladar.\nDalinar’s stood alone, and Shallan could sense hostility between them and\nthe others in the hallway.\nDalinar’s guards had very few lighteyes among them.

The man with the shoulder-length\nhair, curling slightly… He was speaking in a low voice with another soldier,\nwho was one of the men from the gates below.\n“Looks like they beat us up here,” Vathah said softly.\nThe man turned and looked her right in the eyes, then glanced down\ntoward her feet.\nOh no.\nThe man—an officer, by the uniform—strode directly toward her. He\nignored the hostile stares of the other highprinces’ soldiers as he walked\nright up to Shallan. “Prince Adolin,” he said flatly, “is engaged to a\nHorneater?”\nShe’d almost forgotten the encounter two days outside of the warcamps.\nI’m going to strangle that— She cut off, feeling a stab of depression. She\nhad ended up killing Tyn.\n“Obviously not,” Shallan said, raising her chin and not using the\nHorneater accent. “I was traveling alone through the wilderness. Revealing\nmy true identity did not seem prudent.”\nThe man grunted. “Where are my boots?”\n“Is this how you address a lighteyed lady of rank?”\n“It’s how I address a thief,” the man said. “I’d just gotten those boots.”\n“I’ll have a dozen new pairs sent to you,” Shallan said. “After I have\nspoken with Highprince Dalinar.”\n“You think I’m going to let you see him?”\n“You think you get to choose?”\n“I’m captain of his guard, woman.”\nBlast, she thought. That was going to be inconvenient. At least she\nwasn’t trembling from the confrontation. She really was past that. Finally.\n“Well tell me, Captain,” she said. “What is your name?”\n“Kaladin.” Odd. That sounded like a lighteyes’s name.\n“Excellent. Now I have a name to use when I tell the highprince about\nyou. He’s not going to like his son’s betrothed being treated this way.”\nKaladin waved to several of his soldiers.

So things have been going well for you…”\n“You know this man?” Shallan asked Kaladin.\n“He tried to get me killed,” Kaladin said, voice even. “On multiple\noccasions. He’s one of the most hateful little rats I’ve ever known.”\nGreat.\n“You’re not Adolin’s betrothed,” Kaladin said, meeting her gaze as\nseveral of his men gleefully seized Gaz, who had backed into other guards\ncoming up from below. “Adolin’s betrothed has drowned.

She took his arm in her freehand\nas he turned to give orders to his men. “Is this really all because I lied to\nyou?” she demanded more softly.\nHe looked back at her. “It’s about doing my job.”\n“Your job is to be offensive and asinine?”\n“No, I’m offensive and asinine on my own time too. My job is to keep\npeople like you away from Dalinar Kholin.”\n“I guarantee he will want to see me.”\n“Well, forgive me for not trusting the word of a Horneater princess.\nWould you like some shells to chew on while my men tow you away to the\ndungeons?”\nAll right, that’s enough.\n“The dungeons sound wonderful!” she said. “At least there, I’d be away\nfrom you, idiot man!”\n“Only for a short time. I’d be by to interrogate you.”\n“What? I couldn’t pick a more pleasant option? Like being executed?”\n“You’re assuming I could find a hangman willing to put up with your\nblathering long enough to fit the rope.”\n“Well, if you want to kill me, you could always let your breath do the\njob.”\nHe reddened, and several guards nearby started snickering. They tried to\nstifle their reaction as Captain Kaladin looked at them.\n“I should envy you,” he said, turning back to her. “My breath needs to\nbe up close to kill, while that face of yours can kill any man from a\ndistance.”\n“Any man?” she asked. “Why, it’s not working on you. I guess that’s\nproof that you’re not much of a man.”\n“I misspoke. I didn’t mean any man, just males of your own species—\nbut don’t worry, I’ll take care not to let our chulls get close.”\n“Oh?

How often had\nshe tried to get Shallan to control her tongue? True wit was controlled wit.\nIt shouldn’t be allowed to run free, any more than an arrow should be\nloosed in a random direction.\nFor the first time, Shallan realized that the large hallway had grown\nsilent.

But it should work\nanyway.” She looked to Gaz, who was released by Kaladin’s guards so he\ncould join the two of them, though all were still under careful watch.\n“Even for a deserter,” Vathah said under his breath, “you’re a coward,\nGaz.”\nGaz just stared at the ground.\n“How do you know him?” Shallan asked.\n“He was a slave,” Gaz said, “at the lumberyards where I used to work.\nStorming man.

A Matter of Perspective\nNow, as each order was thus matched to the\nnature and temperament of the Herald it named\npatron, there was none more archetypal of this\nthan the Stonewards, who followed after\nTalenelat’Elin, Stonesinew, Herald of War: they\nthought it a point of virtue to exemplify resolve,\nstrength, and dependability. Alas, they took less\ncare for imprudent practice of their stubbornness,\neven in the face of proven error.\nFrom Words of Radiance, chapter 13, page\n1\nThe meeting finally reached a break. They weren’t done—Stormfather,\nit didn’t seem like they’d ever be done—but the arguing was over for the\nmoment. Adolin stood, wounds along his leg and side protesting, and left\nhis father and aunt to speak in hushed tones as the large chamber filled with\na buzz of conversation.\nHow did Father stand it? A full two hours had passed, according to\nNavani’s fabrial clock on the wall. Two hours of highprinces and their\nwives complaining about the Assassin in White. Nobody could agree on\nwhat should be done.\nThey all ignored the truth stabbing them in the face. Nothing could be\ndone. Nothing other than Adolin staying alert and practicing, training to\nface the monster when he returned.\nAnd you think you can beat him? When he can walk on walls and make\nthe very spren of nature obey him?\nIt was a discomforting question. At his father’s suggestion, Adolin had\nreluctantly changed out of his Plate and into something more appropriate.\nWe need to project confidence at this meeting, Dalinar had said, not fear.\nGeneral Khal wore the armor instead, hiding in a room to the side with a\nstrike force. Father seemed to think it unlikely the assassin would strike\nduring the meeting. If the assassin wanted to kill the highprinces, he could\ntake them much more easily alone, in the night. Attacking them all together,\nin the company of their guards and dozens of Shardbearers, seemed like it\nwould be an imprudent decision. Indeed, there were Shards aplenty at this\nmeeting. Three of the highprinces wore their Plate, and the others had\nShardbearers in attendance. Abrobadar, Jakamav, Resi, Relis… Adolin had\nrarely seen so many collected together at once.\nWould any of it matter? Accounts had been flooding in from around the\nworld for weeks. Kings slaughtered. Ruling bodies decapitated all across\nRoshar. In Jah Keved, the assassin had reportedly killed dozens of soldiers\nbearing half-shard shields that could block his Blade, as well as three\nShardbearers, including the king. It was a crisis that spanned the entire\nworld, and one man was behind it. Assuming he was even a man.\nAdolin found himself a cup of sweet wine at the edge of the room,\npoured by an eager servant in blue and gold. Orange wine, basically just\njuice. Adolin downed an entire cup anyway, then went looking for Relis. He\nneeded to be doing something other than sitting and listening to people\ncomplain."

        "text": "juice. Adolin downed an entire cup anyway, then went looking for Relis. He\nneeded to be doing something other than sitting and listening to people\ncomplain.\nFortunately, he’d concocted something while sitting there.\nRelis, Ruthar’s son and star Shardbearer, was a man with a face like a\nshovel—flat and wide, with a nose that seemed like it had been smashed.\nHe wore a frilly outfit of green and yellow. It wasn’t even interesting. He\nhad the choice to wear anything, and he chose this?\nHe was a full Shardbearer, one of the few in the camps. He was also the\ncurrent dueling champion—which, along with his parentage, made him of\nparticular interest to Adolin. He stood speaking with his cousin Elit and a\ngroup of three of Sadeas’s attendants: women in the traditional Vorin havah.\nOne of those women, Melali, gave Adolin a pointed glare. She was as pretty\nas she’d ever been, her hair up in complex braids and stuck with hairspikes.\nWhat had he done to annoy her, again? It had been forever since they’d\ncourted.\n“Relis,” Adolin said, raising his cup, “I just wanted you to know that I\nfound it very brave of you to offer to fight the assassin yourself, when you\nspoke earlier. It is inspiring that you’d be willing to die for the Crown.”\nRelis scowled at Adolin. How did someone get a face so flat? Had he\nbeen dropped as a child? “You’re assuming I’d lose.”\n“Well, of course you would,” Adolin said, chuckling. “I mean, let’s be\nhonest, Relis. You’ve been sitting on your title for almost half a year. You\nhaven’t won a duel of any importance since you defeated Epinar.”\n“This from a man who spent years refusing almost all challenges,”\nMelali said, looking Adolin up and down. “I’m surprised your daddy let you\nfree to come talk. Isn’t he afraid you might hurt yourself?”\n“Nice to see you too, Melali,” Adolin said. “How’s your sister?”\n“Off limits.”\nOh, right. That was what he’d done. Honest mistake. “Relis,” Adolin\nsaid. “You claim you’d face this assassin, yet you’re frightened of dueling\nme?”\nRelis spread his hands, one holding a shimmering goblet of red wine.\n“It’s protocol, Adolin! I’ll duel you once you fight up through the brackets\nfor a year or two. I can’t just take on any old challenger, particularly not in\na bout with our Shards on the line!”\n“Any old challenger?” Adolin said. “Relis, I’m one of the best there is.”\n“Are you?” Relis asked, smiling. “After that display with Eranniv?”\n“Yes, Adolin,” said Elit, Relis’s short, balding cousin. “You’ve only had\na handful of duels of any consequence in recent memory—in one of those\nyou basically cheated, and in the second you won by sheer luck!”\nRelis nodded. “If I bend the rules and accept your challenge, then it will\nbreak the stormwall. I’ll have dozens of inferior swordsmen nipping at me.”"

I’ll have dozens of inferior swordsmen nipping at me.”\n“No you won’t,” Adolin said. “Because you won’t be a Shardbearer any\nlonger. You’ll have lost to me.”\n“So confident,” Relis said, chuckling, turning to Elit and the women.\n“Listen to him. He ignores the rankings for months, then leaps back in and\nassumes he can beat me.”\n“I’ll wager both my Plate and Blade,” Adolin said. “And my brother’s\nPlate and Blade, along with the Shard I won from Eranniv. Five Shards to\nyour two.”\nElit started. The man was a Shardbearer with only the Plate—given to\nhim by his cousin. He turned to Relis, looking hungry.\nRelis paused. Then he closed his mouth and cocked his head lazily to\nthe side as he met Adolin’s eyes. “You’re a fool, Kholin.”\n“I’m offering it here, before witnesses,” Adolin said. “You win this\nbout, you take every Shard my family owns. What’s stronger? Your fear or\nyour greed?”\n“My pride,” Relis said. “No contest, Adolin.”\nAdolin ground his teeth. He’d hoped the duel with Eranniv would make\nothers underestimate him, make them more likely to duel him. It wasn’t\nworking. Relis barked out a laugh. He held out his arm to Melali, and\ntugged her away, his attendants following.\nElit hesitated.\nWell, it’s better than nothing, Adolin thought, a plan forming. “What\nabout you?” Adolin asked the cousin.\nElit looked him up and down. Adolin didn’t know the man well. He was\nsaid to be a passable duelist, though he was often in his cousin’s shadow.\nBut that hunger—Elit wanted to be a full Shardbearer.\n“Elit?” Relis said.\n“Same offer?” Elit said, meeting Adolin’s gaze. “Your five to my one?”\nWhat a terrible deal.\n“Same offer,” Adolin said.\n“I’m in,” Elit said.\nBehind him, Ruthar’s son groaned. He grabbed Elit by the shoulder,\ntowing him to the side with a growl.\n“You told me to fight up through the brackets,” Adolin said to Relis.\n“I’m doing that.”\n“Not my cousin.”\n“Too late,” Adolin said. “You heard it. The ladies heard it. When do we\nfight, Elit?”\n“Seven days,” Elit said. “On Chachel.”\nSeven days—a long wait, considering a challenge like this. So, he\nwanted time to train, did he? “How about tomorrow instead?”\nRelis snarled at Adolin, a very un-Alethi display, and shoved his cousin\nfarther away. “I can’t see why you’re so eager, Adolin. Shouldn’t you focus\non protecting that father of yours? It’s always sad when a soldier lives long\nenough to see his wits go. Has he started wetting himself in public yet?”\nSteady, Adolin told himself. Relis was trying to goad him, maybe get"

        "text": "enough to see his wits go. Has he started wetting himself in public yet?”\nSteady, Adolin told himself. Relis was trying to goad him, maybe get\nAdolin to take a hasty swing. That would let him petition to the king for\nredress and a voiding of all contracts with his house—including the dueling\nagreement with Elit. But the insult went too far. His companions gasped\nslightly, pulling away at the very un-Alethi bluntness.\nAdolin didn’t give in to the desperate goading. He had what he wanted.\nHe wasn’t certain what he could do about the assassin—but this, this was a\nway to help. Elit wasn’t ranked highly, but he served Ruthar, who was—\nmore and more—acting as Sadeas’s right-hand man. Beating him would\ntake Adolin one step closer to the real goal. A duel with Sadeas himself.\nHe turned to leave, and stopped short. Someone stood behind him—a\nstout man with a bulbous face and black curly hair. His complexion was\nruddy, the nose too red, fine veins visible in his cheeks. The man had the\narms of a soldier, despite his frivolous outfit—which was, Adolin admitted\ngrudgingly, quite fashionable. Dark slacks that were trimmed with forest\ngreen silk, a short open coat over a stiff matching shirt. Scarf at the neck.\nTorol Sadeas, highprince, Shardbearer, and the very man Adolin had\nbeen thinking of—the single person he hated most in the world.\n“Another duel, young Adolin,” Sadeas said, taking a sip of wine. “You\nreally are determined to embarrass yourself out there. I still find it strange\nyour father abandoned his prohibition of you dueling—indeed, I thought it a\nmatter of honor to him.”\nAdolin pushed past Sadeas, not trusting himself to speak so much as a\nsingle word to this eel of a man. Sight of the man brought memories of\nstark panic as he watched Sadeas retreat from the field of battle to leave\nAdolin and his father alone and surrounded.\nHavar, Perethom, and Ilamar—good soldiers, good friends—had died\nthat day. They and six thousand more.\nSadeas grabbed Adolin’s shoulder as he passed. “Think what you will,\nson,” the man whispered, “but what I did was intended as a kindness to\nyour father. A tip of the sword to an old ally.”\n“Let. Go.”\n“If you lose your mind as you age, pray to the Almighty there are people\nlike myself willing to give you a good death. People who care enough not to\nsnicker, but instead hold the sword for you as you fall on it.”\n“I’ll have your throat in my hands, Sadeas,” Adolin hissed. “I’ll squeeze\nand squeeze, then I’ll sink my dagger into your gut and twist. A quick death\nis too good for you.”\n“Tsk,” Sadeas said, smiling. “Careful. It’s a full room. What if someone\nheard you threatening a highprince?”\nThe Alethi way. You could abandon an ally on the battlefield, and\neveryone could know it—but an offense in person, well, that just wouldn’t"

You could abandon an ally on the battlefield, and\neveryone could know it—but an offense in person, well, that just wouldn’t\ndo. Society would frown on that. Nalan’s hand! His father was right about\nthem all.\nAdolin turned in a quick motion, reversing out of Sadeas’s grip. His\nnext moves were by instinct, his fingers balling, stepping in preparation to\nplant a fist in that smiling, self-satisfied face.\nA hand fell on Adolin’s shoulder, causing him to hesitate.\n“I don’t think that would be wise, Brightlord Adolin,” said a soft but\nstern voice. It reminded Adolin of his father, though the timbre was off. He\nglanced at Amaram, who had stepped up beside him.\nTall, with a face like chipped stone, Brightlord Meridas Amaram was\none of the only lighteyed men in the room who wore a proper uniform. As\nmuch as Adolin wished he himself could wear something more fashionable,\nhe had come to realize the importance of the uniform as a symbol.\nAdolin took a deep breath, lowering his fist. Amaram nodded to Sadeas,\nthen turned Adolin by his shoulder and walked him away from the\nhighprince.\n“You mustn’t let him provoke you, Your Highness,” Amaram said\nsoftly. “He’ll use you to embarrass your father, if he can.”\nThey moved through the room full of chattering attendants. Drinks and\nfinger food had been distributed. It had turned from a short break during the\nmeeting into a full-blown party. Not surprising. With all the important\nlighteyes here, people would want to mingle and connive.\n“Why do you remain with him, Amaram?” Adolin asked.\n“He is my liege lord.”\n“You’re of a rank that you could choose a new liege. Stormfather!\nYou’re a Shardbearer now. Nobody would even question you. Come to our\ncamp. Join with Father.”\n“In doing that, I would create a divide,” Amaram said softly. “So long\nas I remain with Sadeas, I can help bridge gaps. He trusts me. So does your\nfather. My friendship with both is a step toward keeping this kingdom\ntogether.”\n“Sadeas will betray you.”\n“No. Highprince Sadeas and I have an understanding.”\n“We thought we had one. Then he set us up.”\nAmaram’s expression grew distant. Even the way he walked was so full\nof decorum, straight back, nodding with respect to many they passed. The\nperfect lighteyed general—brilliantly capable, yet not lofty. A sword for his\nhighprince to employ. He’d spent the majority of the war diligently training\nnew troops and sending the best of them to Sadeas while guarding sections\nof Alethkar. Amaram was half the reason that Sadeas had been so effective\nout here on the Shattered Plains.\n“Your father is a man who cannot bend,” Amaram said. “I wouldn’t\nhave it any other way, Adolin—but it does mean that the man he has\nbecome is not someone who can work with Highprince Sadeas.”\n“And you’re different?”\n“Yes.”\nAdolin snorted.

Amaram was one of the finest the kingdom had, a man\nwith a sterling reputation. “I doubt that.”\n“Sadeas and I agree that the means we choose to reach an honorable\ngoal are allowed to be distasteful. Your father and I agree on what that goal\nshould be—a better Alethkar, a place without all of this squabbling. It is a\nmatter of perspective…”\nHe continued talking, but Adolin found his mind drifting. He’d heard\nenough of this speech from his father. If Amaram started quoting The Way\nof Kings at him, he’d probably scream. At least—\nWho was that?\nGorgeous red hair. There wasn’t a single lock of black in it. A slender\nbuild, so different from the curvaceous Alethi. A silken blue dress, simple\nyet elegant. Pale skin—it almost had a Shin look to it—matched by light\nblue eyes. A slight dusting of freckles under the eyes, giving her an exotic\ncast.\nThe young woman seemed to glide through the room. Adolin twisted\nabout, watching her pass. She was so different.\n“Ash’s eyes!” Amaram said, chuckling. “You’re still doing that, are\nyou?”\nAdolin pried his eyes away from the girl. “Doing what?”\n“Letting your eyes be drawn by every flitting little thing that swishes by.\nYou need to settle down, son. Pick one. Your mother would be mortified to\nfind you still unwed.”\n“Jasnah’s unwed too. She’s a decade older than me.” Assuming she was\nstill alive, as Aunt Navani was convinced.\n“Your cousin is hardly a role model in that regard.” His tone implied\nmore. Or any regard.\n“Look at her, Amaram,” Adolin said, craning to the side and watching\nthe young woman approach his father. “That hair. Have you ever seen\nanything such a deep shade of red?”\n“Veden, I’d warrant,” Amaram said. “Horneater blood. There are family\nlines that pride themselves on it.”\nVeden. It couldn’t be… Could it?\n“Excuse me,” Adolin said, breaking away from Amaram and shoving—\npolitely—his way over to where the young woman was speaking to his\nfather and his aunt.\n“Brightlady Jasnah did go down with the ship, I’m afraid,” the woman\nwas saying. “I’m sorry for your loss…”\n38. The Silent Storm\nNow, as the Windrunners were thus engaged,\narose the event which has hitherto been\nreferenced: namely, that discovery of some wicked\nthing of eminence, though whether it be some\nrogueries among the Radiants’ adherents or of\nsome external origin, Avena would not suggest.\nFrom Words of Radiance, chapter 38, page\n6\n“… sorry for your loss,” Shallan said. “I have brought with me what\nthings of Jasnah’s I was able to recover.

My men have them outside.”\nShe found it surprisingly difficult to say the words with an even tone.\nShe’d grieved for Jasnah during her weeks traveling, yet speaking of the\ndeath—remembering that terrible night—returned the emotions like surging\nwaves, threatening to overwhelm again.\nThe image she’d drawn of herself came to her rescue. She could be that\nwoman today—and that woman, while not emotionless, could push through\nthe loss. She focused her attention on the moment, and the task at hand—\nspecifically the two people in front of her. Dalinar and Navani Kholin.\nThe highprince was exactly what she’d expected him to be: a man with\nblunted features, short black hair silvering at the sides. His stiff uniform\nmade him seem the only one in the room who knew anything about combat.\nShe wondered if those bruises on his face were the result of the campaign\nagainst the Parshendi. Navani looked like a version of Jasnah twenty years\nolder, still pretty, though with a motherly air. Shallan could never imagine\nJasnah being motherly.\nNavani had been smiling as Shallan approached, but now that levity was\ngone. She still had hope for her daughter, Shallan thought as the woman sat\ndown in a nearby seat. I just crushed it.\n“I thank you for bringing us this news,” Brightlord Dalinar said. “It is…\ngood to have confirmation.”\nIt felt terrible. Not just to be reminded of the death, but to weigh others\ndown with it as well. “I have information for you,” Shallan said, trying to\nbe delicate. “About the things Jasnah was working on.”\n“More about those parshmen?” Navani snapped. “Storms, that woman\nwas too fascinated by them. Ever since she got it into her head that she was\nto blame for Gavilar’s death.”\nWhat was this? That wasn’t a side of all this that Shallan had ever\nheard.\n“Her research can wait,” Navani said, eyes fierce. “I want to know\nexactly what happened when you think you saw her die. Precisely as you\nremember it, girl. No details passed over.”\n“Perhaps after the meeting…” Dalinar said, resting a hand on Navani’s\nshoulder. The touch was surprisingly tender. Was this not his brother’s\nwife? That look in his eyes; was that familial affection for his sister, or was\nit something more?\n“No, Dalinar,” Navani said. “Now. I would hear it now.”\nShallan took a deep breath, preparing to begin, steeling herself against\nthe emotions—and finding herself surprisingly in control. As she gathered\nher thoughts, she noticed a blond-haired young man watching her. That\nwould likely be Adolin. He was handsome, as rumors indicated, and wore a\nblue uniform like his father. And yet Adolin’s was somehow more…\nstylish? Was that the right word? She liked how his somewhat unruly hair\ncontrasted with the crisp uniform. It made him seem more real, less\npicturesque.\nShe turned back to Navani. “I woke in the middle of the night to\nshouting and the smell of smoke. I opened my door to unfamiliar men\ncrowded around the doorway to Jasnah’s cabin, across the companionway"

I opened my door to unfamiliar men\ncrowded around the doorway to Jasnah’s cabin, across the companionway\nfrom my own. They had her body on the floor, and… Brightness, I watched\nthem stab her through the heart. I’m sorry.”\nNavani tensed, head flinching, as if she’d been slapped.\nShallan continued. She tried to give Navani as much truth as she could,\nbut obviously the things Shallan had done—weaving light, Soulcasting the\nship—weren’t wise to share, at least for now. Instead, she indicated that\nshe’d barricaded herself in her cabin, a lie she’d already prepared.\n“I heard the men yelling up above as they were being executed, one by\none,” Shallan said. “I realized that the only hope I could give them was a\ncrisis for the brigands, so I used the torch I’d taken and set the ship on fire.”\n“On fire?” Navani asked, horrified. “With my daughter unconscious?”\n“Navani—” Dalinar said, squeezing her shoulder.\n“You doomed her,” Navani said, locking eyes with Shallan. “Jasnah\nwouldn’t have been able to swim, like the others. She—”\n“Navani,” Dalinar repeated, more firmly. “This child’s choice was a\ngood one. You can hardly expect her to have taken on a band of men single-\nhanded. And what she saw… Jasnah was not unconscious, Navani. It was\ntoo late to do anything for her at that point.”\nThe woman took a deep breath, obviously struggling to keep her\nemotions in check. “I… apologize,” she said to Shallan. “I am not myself at\nthe moment, and I stray toward the irrational. Thank… thank you for\nbringing word to us.” She stood. “Excuse me.”\nDalinar nodded, letting her make a reasonably graceful exit. Shallan\nstepped back, hands clasped before herself, feeling impotent and strangely\nashamed as she watched Navani leave. She hadn’t expected that to go\nparticularly well. And it hadn’t.\nShe took the moment to check on Pattern, who was on her skirt,\npractically invisible. Even if he was noticed, he’d be thought an odd part of\nthe fabric design—assuming, that was, he did as she’d ordered and didn’t\nmove or speak.\n“I assume your trip here was an ordeal,” Dalinar said, turning to\nShallan. “Shipwrecked in the Frostlands?”\n“Yes. Fortunately, I met with a caravan and traveled with them this way.\nWe did encounter bandits, I regret to say, but were rescued by the timely\narrival of some soldiers.”\n“Soldiers?” Dalinar said, surprised. “From what banner?”\n“They did not say,” Shallan replied. “I take it they were formerly of the\nShattered Plains.”\n“Deserters?”\n“I have not asked for specifics, Brightlord,” Shallan said. “But I did\npromise them clemency for previous crimes, in recognition of their act of\nnobility. They saved dozens of lives. Everyone in the caravan I joined can\nvouch for the bravery of these men. I suspect they sought atonement and a\nchance to start over.”"

I suspect they sought atonement and a\nchance to start over.”\n“I will see that the king seals pardons for them,” Dalinar said. “Prepare\na list for me. Hanging soldiers always feels like a waste.”\nShallan relaxed. One item dealt with.\n“There is another matter of some delicacy we must discuss, Brightlord,”\nShallan said. They both turned toward Adolin, loitering nearby. He smiled.\nAnd he did have a very nice smile.\nWhen Jasnah had first explained the causal to her, Shallan’s interest had\nbeen completely abstract. Marriage into a powerful Alethi house? Allies for\nher brothers? Legitimacy, and a way to continue working with Jasnah for\nthe salvation of the world? These had seemed like wonderful things.\nLooking at Adolin’s grin, however, she didn’t consider any of those\nadvantages. Her pains of speaking of Jasnah didn’t fade completely, but she\nfound it much easier to ignore them when looking at him. She found herself\nblushing.\nThis, she thought, could be dangerous.\nAdolin stepped up to join them, the hum of conversation all around\ngiving them some privacy within the crowd. He had found a cup of orange\nwine for her somewhere, which he held out. “Shallan Davar?” he asked.\n“Um…” Was she? Oh, right. She took the wine. “Yes?”\n“Adolin Kholin,” he said. “I am sorry to hear of your hardships. We will\nneed to speak to the king of his sister. I can spare you that task, if I might go\nin your place.”\n“Thank you,” Shallan said. “But I would prefer to see him myself.”\n“Of course,” Adolin said. “As for our… involvement. It did make a lot\nmore sense when you were Jasnah’s ward, didn’t it?”\n“Probably.”\n“Though, now that you’re here, perhaps we should go for a walk and\njust see how things feel.”\n“I like to walk,” Shallan said. Stupid! Quick, say something witty. “Um.\nYour hair is nice.”\nA part of her—the part trained by Tyn—groaned.\n“My hair?” Adolin said, touching it.\n“Yes,” Shallan said, trying to get her sluggish brain working again.\n“Blond hair isn’t often seen in Jah Keved.”\n“Some people see it as a mark of my bloodline being impure.”\n“Funny. They say the same about me because of my hair.” She smiled at\nhim. That seemed the right move, since he smiled back. Her verbal recovery\nhadn’t been the deftest of her career, but she couldn’t be doing too poorly,\nso long as he was smiling.\nDalinar cleared his throat. Shallan blinked. She’d completely forgotten\nthat the highprince was there.\n“Adolin,” he said, “fetch me some wine.”\n“Father?” Adolin turned to him. “Oh. All right, then.” He walked off.\nAsh’s eyes, that man was handsome. She turned to Dalinar who, well,\nwasn’t. Oh, he was distinguished, but his nose had been broken at some"

Oh, he was distinguished, but his nose had been broken at some\npoint, and his face was a tad unfortunate. The bruises didn’t help either.\nIn fact, he was downright intimidating.\n“I would know more of you,” he said softly, “the precise status of your\nfamily, and why you are so eager to be involved with my son.”\n“My family is destitute,” Shallan said. Frankness seemed the right\napproach with this man. “My father is dead, though the people to whom we\nowe money do not yet know it. I had not considered a union with Adolin\nuntil Jasnah suggested it, but I would seize it eagerly, if allowed. Marriage\ninto your house would provide my family with a great deal of protection.”\nShe still didn’t know what to do about the Soulcaster her brothers owed.\nOne step at a time.\nDalinar grunted. He wouldn’t have expected her to be so direct. “So you\nhave nothing to offer,” he said.\n“From what Jasnah said to me of your opinions,” Shallan said, “I did\nnot assume that my monetary or political offerings would be your first\nconsideration. If such a union was your goal, you’d have had Prince Adolin\nmarried off years ago.” She winced at her forwardness. “With all due\nrespect, Brightlord.”\n“No offense taken,” Dalinar said. “I like it when people are direct. Just\nbecause I want to let my son have a say in the matter doesn’t mean I don’t\nwant him to marry well. A woman from a minor foreign house who\nprofesses her family is destitute and who brings nothing to the union?”\n“I did not say I could offer nothing,” Shallan replied. “Brightlord, how\nmany wards has Jasnah Kholin taken in the last ten years?”\n“None that I know of,” he admitted.\n“Do you know how many she has turned away?”\n“I’ve an inkling.”\n“Yet she took me. Might that not constitute an endorsement of what I\ncan offer?”\nDalinar nodded slowly. “We will maintain the causal for now,” he said.\n“The reason I agreed to it in the first place still stands—I want Adolin to be\nseen as unavailable to those who would manipulate him for political gain. If\nyou can somehow persuade me, Brightness Navani, and of course the lad\nhimself, we can progress the causal to a full betrothal. In the meantime, I’ll\ngive you a position among my lesser clerks. You can prove yourself there.”\nThe offer, though generous, felt like ropes tightening about her. The\nstipend of a lesser clerk would be enough to live on, but nothing to brag\nabout. And she had no doubt that Dalinar would be watching her. Those\neyes of his were scarily discerning. She wouldn’t be able to move without\nher actions being reported to him.\nHis charity would be her prison.\n“That is generous of you, Brightlord,” she found herself saying, “but I\nactually have—”\n“Dalinar!” one of the others in the room called. “Are we going to start\nthis meeting again sometime today, or am I going to have to order in a\nproper dinner!”\nDalinar turned toward a plump, bearded man in traditional clothing—an"

        "text": "this meeting again sometime today, or am I going to have to order in a\nproper dinner!”\nDalinar turned toward a plump, bearded man in traditional clothing—an\nopen-fronted robe over a loose shirt and warrior’s skirt, called a takama.\nHighprince Sebarial, Shallan thought. Jasnah’s notes dismissed him as\nobnoxious and useless. She’d had kinder words even for Highprince\nSadeas, whom she had noted was not to be trusted.\n“Fine, fine, Sebarial,” Dalinar said, breaking away from Shallan and\nwalking to a group of seats in the center of the room. He settled down in\none beside the desk there. A proud man with a prominent nose settled down\nnext to him. That would be the king, Elhokar. He was younger than Shallan\nhad pictured. Why had Sebarial called on Dalinar to reconvene the meeting,\nand not the king?\nThe next few moments were a test of Shallan’s preparation as highborn\nmen and women settled themselves in the lavish chairs. Beside each one\nwas a small table and behind that, a master-servant for important needs. A\nnumber of parshmen kept the tables filled with wine, nuts, and fresh and\ndried fruit. Shallan shivered each time one of those passed her.\nShe counted the highprinces off in her head. Sadeas was easy to pick\nout, red-faced from visible veins under the skin, like her father had\ndisplayed after drinking. Others nodded to him and let him seat himself\nfirst. He seemed to command as much respect as Dalinar. His wife, Ialai,\nwas a slender-necked woman with thick lips, large bust, and a wide mouth.\nJasnah had noted that she was as shrewd as her husband.\nTwo highprinces sat to either side of the couple. One was Aladar, a\nrenowned duelist. The short man was listed in Jasnah’s notes as a powerful\nhighprince, fond of taking risks, known to gamble in the type of games of\nrandom chance that the devotaries forbade. He and Sadeas seemed to be on\nvery friendly terms. Weren’t they enemies? She’d read that they often\nsquabbled over lands. Well, that was obviously a broken stone, for they\nseemed united as they regarded Dalinar.\nJoining them were Highprince Ruthar and his wife. Jasnah considered\nthem to be little more than thieves, but warned that the pair were dangerous\nand opportunistic.\nThe room seemed oriented so that all eyes were on those two factions.\nThe king and Dalinar against Sadeas, Ruthar, and Aladar. Obviously, the\npolitical alignments had changed since Jasnah made her notes.\nThe room hushed, and nobody seemed to care that Shallan was\nwatching. Adolin took a seat behind his father, next to a younger man in\nspectacles and an empty seat probably vacated by Navani. Shallan carefully\nrounded the room—the peripheries were clogged with guards, attendants,\nand even some men in Shardplate—getting out of Dalinar’s direct line of\nsight, just in case he noticed her and decided to eject her.\nBrightlady Jayla Ruthar spoke first, leaning forward over clasped hands.\n“Your Majesty,” she said, “I fear that our conversation this day has run in"

Your safety is, of course,\nour greatest concern.”\nAcross the circle of highprinces, Sebarial snorted loudly as he chewed\non slices of melon. Everyone else seemed to pointedly ignore the\nobnoxious, bearded man.\n“Yes,” Aladar said. “The Assassin in White. We must do something. I\nwill not wait in my palace to be assassinated.”\n“He is murdering princes and kings all across the world!” Roion added.\nThe man looked like a turtle to Shallan, with those hunched shoulders and\nthat balding head. What had Jasnah said about him… ?\nThat he’s a coward, Shallan thought. He always chooses the safe option.\n“We must present a unified Alethkar,” Hatham said—she recognized\nhim immediately, with that long neck and refined way of speaking. “We\nmust not allow ourselves to be attacked one at a time, and we must not\nsquabble.”\n“That’s precisely why you should follow my commands,” the king said,\nfrowning at the highprinces.\n“No,” Ruthar said, “it is why we must abandon these ludicrous\nrestrictions you have placed upon us, Your Majesty! This is not a time to\nlook foolish before the world.”\n“Listen to Ruthar,” Sebarial said dryly, leaning back in his chair. “He’s\nan expert at looking like a fool.”\nThe arguing continued, and Shallan got a better feel for the room. There\nwere actually three factions. Dalinar and the king, the team with Sadeas,\nand what she dubbed the peacemakers. Led by Hatham—who seemed,\nwhen he spoke, the most natural politician in the room—this third group\nsought to mediate.\nSo that’s what it’s really about, she thought, listening as Ruthar argued\nwith the king and Adolin Kholin. They’re each trying to persuade these\nneutral highprinces to join their faction.\nDalinar said little. The same for Sadeas, who seemed content to let\nHighprince Ruthar and his wife speak for him. The two watched each other,\nDalinar with a neutral expression, Sadeas with a faint smile. It seemed\ninnocent enough until you saw their eyes. Locked on to one another, rarely\nblinking.\nThere was a storm in this room. A silent one.\nEveryone seemed to fall into one of the three factions except for\nSebarial, who kept rolling his eyes, occasionally throwing out commentary\nthat bordered on the obscene. He obviously made the other Alethi, with\ntheir haughty airs, uncomfortable.\nShallan slowly picked apart the conversation’s subtext. This talk of\nprohibitions and rules placed by the king… it wasn’t the rules themselves\nthat seemed to matter, but the authority behind them. How much would the\nhighprinces submit to the king, and how much autonomy could they\ndemand? It was fascinating.\nRight up to the moment when one of them mentioned her.\n“Wait,” said Vamah—one of the neutral highprinces. “Who is that girl\nover there? Does someone have a Veden in their retinue?”"

Does someone have a Veden in their retinue?”\n“She was speaking with Dalinar,” Roion said. “Is there news of Jah\nKeved that you’re keeping from us, Dalinar?”\n“You, girl,” said Ialai Sadeas. “What can you tell us of your homeland’s\nsuccession war? Do you have information on this assassin? Why would\nsomeone in the employ of the Parshendi seek to undermine your throne?”\nAll eyes in the room turned toward Shallan. She felt a moment of sheer\npanic. The most important people in the world, interrogating her, their eyes\ndrilling into her—\nAnd then she remembered the drawing. That was who she was.\n“Alas,” Shallan said, “I will be of little use to you, Brightlords and\nBrightladies. I was away from my homeland when that tragic assassination\noccurred, and I have no insight into its cause.”\n“Then what are you doing here?” Hatham asked, polite, but insistent.\n“She’s watching the zoo, obviously,” Sebarial said. “The lot of you\nmaking fools of yourselves is the best free entertainment to be found in this\nfrozen wasteland.”\nIt probably was wise to ignore that one. “I am the ward of Jasnah\nKholin,” Shallan said, meeting Hatham’s eyes. “My purpose here is of a\npersonal nature.”\n“Ah,” Aladar said. “The phantom betrothal I’ve heard rumors of.”\n“That’s right,” Ruthar said. He had a decidedly oily look about him,\nwith dark slicked hair, burly arms, and a beard around the mouth. Most\ndisturbing, however, was that smile of his—a smile that seemed far too\npredatory. “Child, what would it take for you to visit my warcamp and\nspeak to my scribes? I need to know what is happening in Jah Keved.”\n“I will do better than that,” Roion said. “Where are you staying, girl? I\noffer an invitation to visit my palace. I too would hear of your homeland.”\nBut… she’d just said she didn’t know anything…\nShallan dredged up Jasnah’s training. They didn’t care about Jah Keved.\nThey wanted to get information about her betrothal—they suspected that\nthere was more to the story.\nThe two who had just invited her were among those Jasnah rated the\nleast politically savvy. The others—like Aladar and Hatham—would wait\nuntil a private time to make the invitation, so they didn’t reveal their interest\nin public.\n“Your concern is unwarranted, Roion,” Dalinar said. “She is, of course,\nstaying in my warcamp and has a position among my clerks.”\n“Actually,” Shallan said, “I didn’t get a chance to respond to your offer,\nBrightlord Kholin. I would love the opportunity to be in your service, but\nalas, I have already taken a position in another warcamp.”\nStunned silence.\nShe knew what she wanted to say next. A huge gamble, one of which\nJasnah would never have approved. She found herself speaking anyway,\ntrusting her instincts. It worked in art, after all."

It worked in art, after all.\n“Brightlord Sebarial,” Shallan said, looking toward the bearded man\nthat Jasnah so thoroughly detested, “was the first to offer me a position and\ninvite me to stay with him.”\nThe man almost choked on his wine. He looked up over the cup toward\nher, narrowing his eyes.\nShe shrugged with what she hoped was an innocent gesture, and smiled.\nPlease…\n“Uh, that’s right,” Sebarial said, leaning back. “She’s a distant family\nrelation. Couldn’t possibly live with myself if I didn’t give her a place to\nstay.”\n“His offer was quite generous,” Shallan said. “Three full broams a week\nsupport.”\nSebarial’s eyes bugged out.\n“I wasn’t aware of this,” Dalinar said, looking from Sebarial to her.\n“I’m sorry, Brightlord,” Shallan said. “I should have told you. I didn’t\nfind it appropriate to be staying in the house of someone who was courting\nme. Surely you understand.”\nHe frowned. “What I’m having trouble understanding is why anyone\nwould want to be closer to Sebarial than they need to be.”\n“Oh, Uncle Sebarial is quite tolerable, once you get used to him,”\nShallan said. “Like a very annoying noise that you eventually learn to\nignore.”\nMost seemed horrified at her comment, though Aladar smiled. Sebarial\n—as she’d hoped—laughed out loud.\n“I guess that is settled,” Ruthar said, dissatisfied. “I do hope you’ll at\nleast be willing to come brief me.”\n“Give it up, Ruthar,” Sebarial said. “She’s too young for you. Though\nwith you involved, I’m sure it would be brief.”\nRuthar sputtered. “I wasn’t implying… You moldy old… Bah!”\nShallan was glad that attention then turned from her back to the topics at\nhand, because that last comment had her blushing. Sebarial was\ninappropriate. Still, he seemed to be making an effort to leave himself out\nof these political discussions, and that seemed like the place where Shallan\nwanted to be. The position with the most freedom. She would still work\nwith Dalinar and Navani on Jasnah’s notes, but she didn’t want to be\nbeholden to them.\nWho is to say being beholden to this man is any different? Shallan\nthought, rounding the room to approach where Sebarial sat, without wife or\nfamily members to attend him. He was unmarried.\n“Almost threw you out on your ear, girl,” Sebarial said quietly, sipping\nhis wine and not looking at her. “Stupid move, putting yourself in my\nhands. Everyone knows I like to set things on fire and watch them burn.”\n“And yet you didn’t throw me out,” she said. “So it wasn’t a stupid\nmove. Merely a risk that paid rewards.”\n“Still might drop you. I’m certainly not paying that three broams. That’s\nalmost as much as my mistress costs, and at least I get something from that\narrangement.”"

That’s\nalmost as much as my mistress costs, and at least I get something from that\narrangement.”\n“You’ll pay,” Shallan said. “It’s a matter of public record now. But don’t\nworry. I will earn my keep.”\n“You have information about Kholin?” Sebarial asked, studying his\nwine.\nSo he did care.\n“Information, yes,” Shallan said. “Less about Kholin, and more about\nthe world itself. Trust me, Sebarial. You’ve just entered into a very\nprofitable arrangement.”\nShe’d have to figure out why that was.\nThe others continued arguing about the Assassin in White, and she\ngathered that he had attacked here but had been fought off. As Aladar\nsteered the conversation to a complaint that his gemstones were being taken\nby the Crown—Shallan didn’t know the reason they’d been seized—\nDalinar Kholin slowly stood up. He moved like a rolling boulder.\nInevitable, implacable.\nAladar trailed off.\n“I passed a curious pile of stones along my path,” Dalinar said. “Of a\ntype I found remarkable. The fractured shale had been weathered by\nhighstorms, blown up against stone of a more durable nature. This pile of\nthin wafers lay as if stacked by some mortal hand.”\nThe others looked at Dalinar as if he were mad. Something about the\nwords tugged at Shallan’s memory. They were a quotation from something\nshe’d once read.\nDalinar turned, walking toward the open windows on the leeward side\nof the room. “But no man had stacked these stones. Precarious though they\nlooked, they were actually quite solid, a formation from once-buried strata\nnow exposed to open air. I wondered how it was possible they remained in\nsuch a neat stack, with the fury of the tempests blowing against them.\n“I soon ascertained their true nature. I found that force from one\ndirection pushed them back against one another and the rock behind. No\namount of pressure I could produce in that manner caused them to shift.\nAnd yet, when I removed one stone from the bottom—pulling it out instead\nof pushing it in—the entire formation collapsed in a miniature avalanche.”\nThe room’s occupants stared at him until Sebarial finally spoke for all\nof them. “Dalinar,” the plump man said, “what in Damnation’s eleventh\nname are you on about?”\n“Our methods aren’t working,” Dalinar said, looking back at the lot of\nthem. “Years at war, and we find ourselves in the same position as before.\nWe can no more fight this assassin now than on the night he killed my\nbrother. The king of Jah Keved put three Shardbearers and half an army up\nagainst the creature, then died with a Blade through the chest, his Shards\nleft to be scavenged by opportunists.\n“If we cannot defeat the assassin, then we must remove his reason for\nattacking. If we can capture or eliminate his employers, then perhaps we\ncan invalidate whatever contract binds him. Last we knew, he was\nemployed by the Parshendi.”\n“Great,” Ruthar said dryly. “All we have to do is win the war, which\nwe’ve only been trying to do for five years.”"

I intend to\nmake peace with the Parshendi. If they will not have it on our terms, then I\nwill set out into the Shattered Plains with my army and any who will join\nme. No more games on plateaus, fighting over gemhearts. I will strike\ntoward the Parshendi camp, find it, and defeat them once and for all.”\nThe king sighed softly, leaning back behind his desk. Shallan guessed\nhe’d been expecting this.\n“Out onto the Shattered Plains,” Sadeas said. “That sounds like a\nmarvelous thing for you to try.”\n“Dalinar,” Hatham said, speaking with obvious care, “I don’t see that\nour situation has changed. The Shattered Plains are still largely unexplored,\nand the Parshendi camp could be literally anywhere out there, hidden\namong miles and miles of terrain that our army cannot traverse without\ngreat difficulty. We agreed that attacking their camp was imprudent, so long\nas they were willing to come to us.”\n“Their willingness to come to us, Hatham,” Dalinar said, “has proved to\nbe a problem, because it puts the battle on their terms. No, our situation\nhasn’t changed. Merely our resolve. This war has persisted far too long\nalready. I will finish it, one way or another.”\n“Sounds wonderful,” Sadeas repeated. “Will you be off tomorrow or\nwait until the next day?”\nDalinar gave him a disdainful look.\n“Just trying to estimate when there will be an open warcamp,” Sadeas\nsaid innocently. “I’ve almost outgrown mine, and wouldn’t mind spilling\ninto a second once the Parshendi slaughter you and yours. To think, after all\nthe trouble you got yourself into by getting surrounded out there, that\nyou’re going to go do it again.”\nAdolin stood up behind his father, face red, angerspren bubbling at his\nfeet like pools of blood. His brother coaxed him back down into his seat.\nThere was something here, obviously, that Shallan was missing.\nI wandered into the middle of all this without nearly enough context, she\nthought. Storms, I’m lucky I haven’t been chewed up already. Suddenly, she\nwasn’t quite so proud of her accomplishments this day.\n“Before the highstorm last night,” Dalinar said, “we had a messenger\nfrom the Parshendi—the first willing to speak with us in ages. He said that\nhis leaders wished to discuss the possibility of peace.”\nThe highprinces looked stunned. Peace? Shallan thought, heart leaping.\nThat would certainly make it easier to get out and search for Urithiru.\n“That very night,” Dalinar said softly, “the assassin struck. Again. Last\ntime he came was just after we had signed a peace treaty with the\nParshendi. Now, he comes again the day of another peace offer.”\n“Those bastards,” Aladar said softly. “Is this some kind of twisted ritual\nof theirs?”\n“It might be a coincidence,” Dalinar said. “The assassin has been"

Surely the Parshendi haven’t contacted all of\nthese people. However, the events make me wary. Almost, I wonder if the\nParshendi are being framed—if someone is using this assassin to make\ncertain that Alethkar never knows peace. But then, the Parshendi did claim\nto have hired him to kill my brother…”\n“Maybe they’re desperate,” Roion said, hunkering down in his chair.\n“One faction among them sues for peace while the other does whatever it\ncan to destroy us.”\n“Either way, I intend to plan for the worst,” Dalinar said, looking to\nSadeas. “I will be making my way to the center of the Shattered Plains—\neither to defeat the Parshendi for good, or to accept their surrender and\ndisarmament—but such an expedition will take time to arrange. I’ll need to\ntrain my men for an extended operation and send scouts to map farther into\nthe middle of the Plains. Beyond that, I need to choose some new\nShardbearers.”\n“… new Shardbearers?” Roion asked, turtle-like head rising in curiosity.\n“I will soon come into the possession of more Shards,” Dalinar said.\n“And are we allowed to know the source of this amazing trove?” Aladar\nasked.\n“Why, Adolin is going to win them from all of you,” Dalinar said.\nSome of the others chuckled, as if it were a joke. Dalinar did not seem\nto intend it as one. He sat back down, and the others took this as marking an\nend to the meeting—once again, it seemed that Dalinar, and not the king,\ntruly led.\nThe entire balance of power has shifted here, Shallan thought. As has\nthe nature of the war. Jasnah’s notes about the court were definitely\noutdated.\n“Well, I suppose you’re going to accompany me back to my camp now,”\nSebarial said to her, rising. “Which means this meeting wasn’t just the usual\nwaste of time listening to blowhards make veiled threats to one another—it\nactually cost me money as well.”\n“It could be worse,” Shallan said, helping the older man rise, as he\nseemed somewhat unsteady on his feet. That passed once he was standing,\nand he pulled his arm free.\n“Worse? How?”\n“I could be boring as well as expensive.”\nHe looked at her, then laughed. “I suppose that’s true. Well, come on\nthen.”\n“Just a moment,” Shallan said, “you go on ahead, and I’ll catch up at\nyour carriage.”\nShe walked off, seeking the king, to whom she personally delivered\nnews of Jasnah’s death. He took it well, with regal dignity. Dalinar had\nprobably already informed him.\nThat task done, she sought out the king’s scribes. A short time later, she\nleft the conference chamber and found Vathah and Gaz waiting nervously\noutside.

Now, let’s be going. I have\narranged a place for us to stay.”\n39. Heterochromatic\nFOUR YEARS AGO\nFather held feasts because he wanted to pretend that everything was all\nright. He invited local brightlords from nearby hamlets, he fed them and\ngave them wine, he displayed his daughter.\nThen, the next day after everyone was gone, he sat at his table and\nlistened to his scribes tell him how impoverished he had grown. Shallan\nsaw him afterward sometimes, holding his forehead, staring straight ahead\nat nothing.\nFor tonight, however, they feasted and pretended.\n“You’ve met my daughter, of course,” Father said, gesturing to Shallan\nas his guests were seated. “The jewel of House Davar, our pride above all\nothers.”\nThe visitors—lighteyes from two valleys over—nodded politely as\nFather’s parshmen brought wine. Both the drink and the slaves were a way\nto display riches Father didn’t actually possess. Shallan had begun helping\nwith the accounts, her duty as daughter. She knew the truth of their\nfinances.\nThe evening’s chill was offset by the crackling hearth; this room might\nhave felt homey somewhere else. Not here.\nThe servants poured her wine. Yellow, mildly intoxicating. Father drank\nviolet, prepared in its strength. He settled himself down at the high table,\nwhich ran the width of the room—the same room where Helaran had\nthreatened to kill him a year and a half ago. They’d received a brief letter\nfrom Helaran six months back, along with a book by the famous Jasnah\nKholin for Shallan to read.\nShallan had read his note to her father in a trembling whisper. It hadn’t\nsaid much. Mostly veiled threats. That night, Father had beaten one of the\nmaids near to death. Isan still walked with a limp. The servants no longer\ngossiped about Father having killed his wife.\nNobody does anything at all to resist him, Shallan thought, glancing\ntoward her father. We’re all too scared.\nShallan’s three other brothers sat in a huddled knot at their own table.\nThey avoided looking at their father or interacting with the guests. Several\nsmall sphere goblets glowed on the tables, but the room as a whole could\nhave used more light. Neither spheres nor hearthlight were enough to drive\nout the gloom. She thought that her father liked it that way.\nThe visiting lighteyes—Brightlord Tavinar—was a slender, well-dressed\nman with a deep red silk coat. He and his wife sat close together at the high\ntable, their teenaged daughter between them. Shallan had not caught her\nname."

Shallan had not caught her\nname.\nAs the evening progressed, Father tried to speak to them a few times,\nbut they gave only terse responses. For all that it was supposed to be a feast,\nnobody seemed to be enjoying themselves. The visitors looked as if they\nwished they’d never accepted the invitation, but Father was more politically\nimportant than they, and good relations with him would be valuable.\nShallan picked at her own food, listening to her father boast about his\nnew axehound breeding stud. He spoke of their prosperity. Lies.\nShe did not want to contradict him. He had been good to her. He was\nalways good to her. Yet, shouldn’t someone do something?\nHelaran might have. He’d left them.\nIt’s growing worse and worse. Someone needs to do something, say\nsomething, to change Father. He shouldn’t be doing the things that he did,\ngrowing drunk, beating the darkeyes…\nThe first course passed. Then Shallan noticed something. Balat—whom\nFather had started calling Nan Balat, as if he were the oldest—kept glancing\nat the guests. That was surprising. He usually ignored them.\nTavinar’s daughter caught his eye, smiled, then looked back at her food.\nShallan blinked. Balat… and a girl? How odd to consider.\nFather didn’t seem to notice. He eventually stood and raised his cup to\nthe room. “Tonight, we celebrate. Good neighbors, strong wine.”\nTavinar and his wife hesitantly raised their cups. Shallan had only just\nbegun to study propriety—it was hard to do, as her tutors kept leaving—but\nshe knew that a good Vorin brightlord was not supposed to celebrate\ndrunkenness. Not that they wouldn’t get drunk, but it was the Vorin way not\nto talk about it. Such niceties were not her father’s strong point.\n“It is an important night,” Father said after taking a sip of his wine. “I\nhave just received word from Brightlord Gevelmar, whom I believe you\nknow, Tavinar. I have been without a wife for too long. Brightlord\nGevelmar is sending his youngest daughter along with writs of marriage.\nMy ardents will perform the service at the end of the month, and I will have\na wife.”\nShallan felt cold. She pulled her shawl closer. The aforementioned\nardents sat at their own table, dining silently. The three men were greying in\nequal measure, and had served long enough to know Shallan’s grandfather\nas a youth. They treated her with kindness, however, and studying with\nthem brought her pleasure when all other things seemed to be collapsing.\n“Why does nobody speak?” Father demanded, turning around the room.\n“I have just become betrothed! You look like a bunch of storming Alethi.\nWe’re Veden! Make some noise, you idiots.”\nThe visitors clapped politely, though they looked even more\nuncomfortable than they had before. Balat and the twins shared looks, and\nthen lightly thumped the table.\n“To the void with all of you.” Father slumped back into his chair as his\nparshmen approached the low table, each bearing a box. “Gifts for my"

Bah!” He drank the rest of his wine.\nThe boys got daggers, very fine pieces engraved like Shardblades.\nShallan’s gift was a necklace of fat silvery links. She held it silently. Father\ndidn’t like her speaking much at feasts, though he always placed her table\nclose to the high table.\nHe never shouted at her. Not directly. Sometimes, she wished he would.\nMaybe then Jushu wouldn’t resent her so. It—\nThe door to the feast hall slammed open. The poor light revealed a tall\nman in dark clothing standing at the threshold.\n“What is this!” Father demanded, rising, slamming his hands on the\ntable. “Who interrupts my feast?”\nThe man strode in. His face was so long and slender, it looked as if it\nhad been pinched. He wore ruffles at the cuffs of his soft maroon coat, and\nthe way he pursed his lips made him look as if he’d just found a latrine that\nhad overflowed in the rain.\nOne of his eyes was intense blue. The other dark brown. Both lighteyed\nand dark. Shallan felt a chill.\nA Davar house servant dashed up to the high table, then whispered to\nFather. Shallan did not catch what was said, but whatever it was, it drained\nthe thunder right out of Father’s expression. He remained standing, but his\njaw dropped.\nA handful of servants in maroon livery filed in around the newcomer.\nHe stepped forward with a precise air, as if choosing his steps with some\ncare to avoid stepping in anything. “I have been sent by His Highness,\nHighprince Valam, ruler of these lands. It has come to his attention that dark\nrumors persist in these lands. Rumors regarding the death of a lighteyed\nwoman.” He met Father’s eyes.\n“My wife was killed by her lover,” Father said. “Who then killed\nhimself.”\n“Others tell a different story, Brightlord Lin Davar,” the newcomer said.\n“Such rumors are… troublesome. They provoke dissatisfaction with His\nHighness. If a brightlord under his rule were to have murdered a lighteyed\nwoman of rank, it is not something he can ignore.”\nFather did not respond with the outrage Shallan would have predicted.\nInstead he waved his hands toward Shallan and the visitors. “Away,” he\nsaid. “Give me space. You there, messenger, let us speak alone. No need to\ndrag mud into the hallway.”\nThe Tavinars rose, looking all too eager to be going. The girl did glance\nback at Balat as they left, whispering softly.\nFather looked toward Shallan, and she realized she’d frozen in place\nagain at the mention of her mother, sitting at her table just before the high\ntable.\n“Child,” Father said softly, “go sit with your brothers.”\nShe withdrew, passing the messenger as he stepped up to the high table.\nThose eyes… It was Redin, the highprince’s bastard son. His father used\nhim as an executioner and assassin, it was said."

His father used\nhim as an executioner and assassin, it was said.\nSince her brothers hadn’t been explicitly banished from the room, they\ntook chairs around the hearth, far enough away to give father privacy. They\nleft a spot for Shallan, and she settled down, the fine silk of her dress\nrumpling. The voluminous way it enveloped her made her feel as if she\nweren’t really there and only the dress mattered.\nThe highprince’s bastard settled down at the table with Father. At least\nsomeone was confronting him. But what if the highprince’s bastard decided\nFather was guilty? What then? Inquest? She didn’t want Father to fall; she\nwanted to stop the darkness that was slowly strangling them all. It seemed\nlike their light had gone out when Mother died.\nWhen Mother…\n“Shallan?” Balat asked. “Are you well?”\nShe shook herself. “Can I see the daggers? They looked quite fine from\nmy table.”\nWikim just stared at the fire, but Balat tossed his to her. She caught it\nclumsily, then pulled it from its sheath, admiring the way the metal folds\nreflected the hearthlight.\nThe boys watched the flamespren dance on the fire. The three brothers\nnever talked anymore.\nBalat glanced over his shoulder, toward the high table. “I wish I could\nhear what was being said,” he whispered. “Maybe they’ll drag him away.\nThat would be fitting, for what he’s done.”\n“He didn’t kill Mother,” Shallan said softly.\n“Oh?” Balat snorted. “Then what did happen?”\n“I…”\nShe didn’t know. She couldn’t think. Not of that time, that day. Had\nFather actually done it? She felt cold again, despite the fire’s warmth.\nThe silence returned.\nSomeone… someone needed to do something.\n“They’re talking about plants,” Shallan said.\nBalat and Jushu looked at her. Wikim continued staring at the fire.\n“Plants,” Balat said flatly.\n“Yes. I can hear them faintly.”\n“I can’t hear a thing.”\nShallan shrugged from within her too-enveloping dress. “My ears are\nbetter than yours. Yes, plants. Father is complaining that the trees in his\ngardens never listen when he tells them to obey. ‘They have been dropping\ntheir leaves because of a sickness,’ he says, ‘and they refuse to grow new\nones.’\n“‘Have you tried beating them for their disobedience?’ the messenger\nasks.\n“‘All the time,’ Father replies. ‘I even break off their limbs, yet they still\ndo not obey! It is untidy. At the very least, they should clean up after\nthemselves.’\n“‘A problem,’ the messenger says, ‘as trees without foliage are hardly\nworth keeping. Fortunately, I have the solution. My cousin once had trees\nthat acted this way, and he found that all he needed to do was sing to them\nand their leaves popped right back out.’\n“‘Ah, of course,’ Father says. ‘I will try that immediately.’\n“‘I hope that it works for you.’\n“‘Well, if it does, I will certainly be relieved.’”"

He was the youngest of the brothers, just\nabove Shallan herself. “Re… leaf… ed…”\nBalat burst into laughter—loud enough that their father glared at them.\n“Oh, that is awful,” Balat said. “That is purely awful, Shallan. You should\nbe ashamed.”\nShe huddled down in her dress, grinning. Even Wikim, the older twin,\ncracked a smile. She hadn’t seen him smile in… how long?\nBalat wiped his eyes. “I actually thought, for a moment, you could\nreally hear them. You little Voidbringer.” He let out a deep breath. “Storms,\nbut that felt good.”\n“We should laugh more,” Shallan said.\n“This hasn’t been a place for laughter,” Jushu said, sipping his wine.\n“Because of Father?” Shallan asked. “There’s one of him and four of us.\nWe just need to be more optimistic.”\n“Being optimistic does not change facts,” Balat said. “I wish Helaran\nhadn’t left.” He thumped his fist down on the side of his chair.\n“Do not begrudge him his travels, Tet Balat,” Shallan said softly. “There\nare so many places to see, places we will probably never visit. Let one of us\ngo to them. Think of the stories he will bring back to us. The colors.”\nBalat looked across the drab blackrock room, with its muted hearths\nglowing red-orange. “Colors. I wouldn’t mind a little more color around\nhere.”\nJushu smiled. “Anything would be a nice change from Father’s face.”\n“Now, don’t be down on Father’s face,” Shallan said. “It’s quite adept at\ndoing its duty.”\n“Which is?”\n“Reminding us all that there are worse things than his odor. It’s really\nquite a noble Calling.”\n“Shallan!” Wikim said. He looked dramatically unlike Jushu. Spindly\nand sunken-eyed, Wikim had hair cut so short he almost looked like an\nardent. “Don’t say such things where Father could hear.”\n“He’s engrossed in conversation,” Shallan said. “But you are right. I\nprobably shouldn’t mock our family. House Davar is distinctive and\nenduring.”\nJushu raised his cup. Wikim nodded sharply.\n“Of course,” she added, “the same could be said for a wart.”\nJushu just about spat out his wine. Balat let out another roaring laugh.\n“Stop that racket!” Father shouted at them.\n“It’s a feast!” Balat called back. “Did you not ask us to be more Veden!”\nFather glared at him, then returned to his conversation with the\nmessenger. The two huddled together at the high table, Father’s posture\nsupplicating, the highprince’s bastard sitting back with an arched eyebrow\nand a still face.\n“Storms, Shallan,” Balat said. “When did you become so clever?”"

She didn’t feel clever. Suddenly, the forwardness of what she’d\nsaid caused her to shrink back into her chair. These things, they’d simply\nslid out of her mouth. “Those are just things… just things I read in a book.”\n“Well, you should read more of those books, small one,” Balat said. “It\nseems brighter in here for it.”\nFather slammed his hand down on the table, shaking cups, rattling\nplates. Shallan glanced at him, worried as he pointed his finger at the\nmessenger and said something. It was too soft and far away for Shallan to\nmake it out, but she knew that look in her father’s eyes. She had seen it\nmany times before he took his cane—or even once the fireplace poker—to\none of the servants.\nThe messenger stood up in a smooth motion. His refinement seemed a\nshield that rebuffed Father’s temper.\nShallan envied him.\n“It appears I will get nowhere with this conversation,” the messenger\nsaid loudly. He looked at Father, but his tone seemed to imply that his\nwords were for them all. “I came prepared for that inevitability. The\nhighprince has given me authority, and I would very much like to know the\ntruth of what happened in this household. Any lighteyes of birth who can\nprovide witness will be welcomed.”\n“They need the testimony of a lighteyes,” Jushu said softly to his\nsiblings. “Father is important enough that they can’t just remove him.”\n“There was one,” the messenger said loudly, “who was willing to speak\nto us of the truth. He has since made himself unavailable. Do any of you\nhave his courage? Will you come with me and testify to the highprince of\nthe crimes committed on these lands?”\nHe looked toward the four of them. Shallan huddled in her chair, trying\nto look small. Wikim didn’t look away from the flames. Jushu looked like\nhe might stand, but then turned to his wine, cursing, his face growing red.\nBalat. Balat grabbed the sides of his chair as if to stand, but then\nglanced at Father. That intensity in Father’s eyes remained. When his rage\nwas red-hot, he yelled, he threw things at the servants.\nIt was now, when his rage became cold, that he grew truly dangerous.\nThis was when Father got quiet. This was when the yelling stopped.\nFather’s yelling, at least.\n“He’ll kill me,” Balat whispered. “If I say a word, he’ll kill me.” His\nearlier bravado melted away. He seemed not a man any longer, but a youth\n—a terrified teenager.\n“You could do it, Shallan,” Wikim hissed at her. “Father won’t dare hurt\nyou. Besides, you actually saw what happened.”\n“I didn’t,” she whispered.\n“You were there!”\n“I don’t know what happened. I don’t remember it.”\nIt didn’t happen.

It said,\nI am a bastard, but even I am not as low as you. He then left, sweeping\nfrom the room and gathering his men outside, his terse orders indicating\nthat he wished to be back on the road despite the late hour, on another\nerrand beyond Father’s estates.\nOnce he was gone, Father placed both of his hands on the table and\nbreathed out deeply. “Go,” he said to the four of them, lowering his head.\nThey hesitated.\n“Go!” Father roared.\nThey fled the room, Shallan scrambling after her brothers. She was left\nwith the sight of her father sinking down into his seat, holding his head. The\ngift he’d given her, the fine necklace, sat forgotten in the opened box on the\ntable just before him.\n40.

The term Recreance was not\nthen applied, but has since become a popular title\nby which this event is named.\nFrom Words of Radiance, chapter 38, page\n6\nSebarial shared his carriage with Shallan as they left the king’s palace\nand rode toward his warcamp. Pattern kept vibrating softly on the folds of\nher skirt, and she had to shush him.\nThe highprince sat across from her, head tilted back against the\ncushioned wall, snoring softly as the carriage rattled. The ground here had\nbeen scraped clean of rockbuds and set with a line of flagstones down the\ncenter, to divide left from right.\nHer soldiers were safe, and would catch up later. She had a base of\noperations and an income. In the tension of the meeting, and then Navani’s\nwithdrawal, the Kholin house hadn’t yet demanded that Shallan turn over\nJasnah’s things. She still needed to approach Navani about helping with the\nresearch, but so far, the day had actually worked out quite well.\nNow Shallan just needed to save the world.\nSebarial snorted and shook awake from his short nap. He settled into his\nseat, wiping his cheek. “You’ve changed.”\n“Excuse me?”\n“You look younger. In there, I would have guessed you were twenty,\nmaybe twenty-five. But now I see that you can’t be older than fourteen.”\n“I am seventeen,” Shallan said dryly.\n“Same difference.” Sebarial grunted. “I could have sworn your dress\nwas more vibrant before, your features sharper, prettier… Must have been\nthe light.”\n“Do you always make a habit of insulting the looks of young ladies?”"

I like that. But\nbe careful—insult the wrong people in this place, and retribution can be\nswift.”\nThrough the carriage window Shallan saw that they were finally\napproaching a warcamp flying Sebarial’s banner. It bore the glyphs sebes\nand laial stylized into a skyeel, deep gold on a black field.\nThe soldiers at the gates saluted, and Sebarial gave orders for one to\nconduct Shallan’s men to his manor when they arrived. The carriage\ncontinued, and Sebarial settled back to watch her, as if anticipating\nsomething.\nShe couldn’t fathom what. Perhaps she was reading him wrong. She\nturned her attention out the window, and soon decided that this place was a\nwarcamp in name only. The streets were straighter than you might have in a\ncity that had grown naturally, but Shallan saw far more civilians than she\ndid soldiers.\nThey passed taverns, open markets, shops, and tall buildings that surely\ncould hold a dozen different families. People crowded many of the streets.\nThe place wasn’t as varied and vibrant as Kharbranth had been, but the\nbuildings were of solid wood and stone, constructed up against one another\nto share support.\n“Rounded roofs,” Shallan said.\n“My engineers say they repel the winds better,” Sebarial said proudly.\n“Also, buildings with rounded corners and sides.”\n“So many people!”\n“Almost all permanent residents. I have the most complete force of\ntailors, artisans, and cooks in the camps. Already, I’ve set up twelve\nmanufactories—textiles, shoes, ceramics, several mills. I control the\nglassblowers as well.”\nShallan turned back toward him. That pride in his voice didn’t at all\nmatch what Jasnah had written of the man. Of course, most of her notes and\nknowledge of the highprinces came from infrequent visits to the Shattered\nPlains, and none had been recent.\n“From what I’ve heard,” Shallan said, “your forces are among the least\nsuccessful in the war against the Parshendi.”\nSebarial got a twinkle in his eyes. “The others hunt quick income from\ngemhearts, but what will they spend their money on? My textile mills will\nsoon produce uniforms at a much cheaper price than they can be shipped in\nfor, and my farmers will provide food far more varied than what is supplied\nthrough Soulcasting. I’m growing both lavis and tallew, not to mention my\nhog farms.”\n“You sly eel,” Shallan said. “While the others fight a war, you’ve been\nbuilding an economy.”\n“I’ve had to be careful,” he confided, leaning in. “I didn’t want them to\nnotice what I was doing at first.”\n“Clever,” Shallan said. “But why are you telling me?”\n“You’ll see it anyway, if you’re to act as one of my clerks.

The others just think I’m a lazy fool.”\n“And so you’re not a lazy fool?”\n“Of course I am!” he exclaimed. “Fighting is too much work. Besides,\nsoldiers die, and that makes me pay out to their families. It’s just useless all\naround.” He looked out the window. “I saw the secret three years back.\nEveryone was moving here, but nobody thought of the place as permanent\n—despite the value of those gemhearts, which ensured that Alethkar would\nalways have a presence here…” He smiled.\nThe carriage eventually pulled up to a modest manor-style home amid\nthe taller tenement buildings. The manor had grounds filled with\nornamental shalebark, a flagstone drive, and even some trees. The stately\nhome, while not enormous, had a refined classical design, with pillars along\nthe front. It used the row of taller stone buildings behind it as a perfect\nwindbreak.\n“We probably have a room for you,” Sebarial said. “Maybe in the\ncellars. Never do seem to have enough space for all of the stuff I’m\nexpected to have. Three full sets of dining furniture. Bah! As if I’m ever\ngoing to have anyone over.”\n“You really don’t think highly of the others, do you?” Shallan asked.\n“I hate them,” Sebarial said. “But I try to hate everyone. That way, I\ndon’t risk leaving out anyone who is particularly deserving. Anyway, here\nwe are. Don’t expect me to help you out of the carriage.”\nShe didn’t need his help, as a footman quickly arrived and assisted her\nas she stepped out onto the stone steps built in beside the driveway. Another\nfootman went to Sebarial, who cursed at him, but accepted the aid.\nA short woman in a fine dress stood on the manor’s steps, hands on her\nhips. She had curly dark hair. From northern Alethkar, then?\n“Ah,” Sebarial said as he and Shallan walked up toward the woman.\n“The bane of my existence. Please try to hold your laughter until we\nseparate. My frail, aging ego can no longer handle the mockery.”\nShallan gave him a confused look.\nThen the woman spoke. “Please tell me you didn’t kidnap her, Turi.”\nNo, not Alethi at all, Shallan thought, trying to judge the woman’s\naccent. Herdazian. The fingernails, with a rocklike cast to them, proved\nthat. She was darkeyed, but her fine dress indicated she was not a servant.\nOf course. The mistress.\n“She insisted on coming with me, Palona,” Sebarial said, climbing the\nsteps. “I couldn’t dissuade her.

Why do I\nput up with you, again?”\n“Because you love me.”\n“Can’t be that,” Sebarial said, pausing beside the front doors. “I’m not\ncapable of love. Too much a curmudgeon. Well, do something with the\ngirl.” He walked inside.\nPalona beckoned Shallan up to join her. “What really happened, child?”\n“He didn’t say anything untrue,” Shallan said, realizing that she was\nblushing. “But he did leave out a few facts. I have come for the purpose of\nan arranged marriage to Adolin Kholin. I thought staying in the Kholin\nhousehold might leave me too restricted, so I sought other options.”\n“Huh. That actually makes it sound like Turi—”\n“Don’t call me that!” a voice called from inside.\n“—that the idiot did something politically savvy.”\n“Well,” Shallan said, “I did kind of bully him into taking me in. And I\nimplied publicly that he was going to give me a very generous stipend.”\n“Too large a one!” the voice said from inside.\n“Is he… standing in there listening?” Shallan asked.\n“He’s good at skulking,” Palona said. “Well, come along.

A\nsweeping, broad staircase leading to a second-floor balcony overlooking the\nentrance hall. Shallan didn’t notice the highprince around, skulking or\notherwise.\nPalona led Shallan to a very nice set of rooms in the eastern wing. They\nwere all white, and richly furnished, the hard stone walls and floors\nsoftened with silk hangings and thick rugs. She hardly deserved such rich\ndecor.\nI suppose I shouldn’t feel that way, Shallan thought as Palona checked\nthe closet for towels and linen. I’m betrothed to a prince.\nStill, so much finery reminded her of her father. The lace, jewelry, and\nsilk he’d given her in attempts to make her forget about… other times…\nShallan blinked, turning to Palona, who was speaking about something.\n“Excuse me?” Shallan asked.\n“Servants,” Palona said. “You have your own lady’s maid?”\n“I don’t,” Shallan said. “I’ve got eighteen soldiers, though, and five\nslaves.”\n“And they’ll be helping you change clothes?”\nShallan blushed. “I mean that I’d like them to be housed, if you can\nmanage it.”\n“I can,” Palona said lightly. “I can probably even find something\nproductive for them to do. You’ll want them paid out of your stipend, I\nassume—your maid as well, which I’ll get for you. Food is served at second\nbell, noon, and tenth bell. If you want something at other times, ask at the\nkitchens. Cook might swear at you, assuming I can get him to come back\nthis time. We’ve a storm cistern, so there’s usually running water. If you\nwant it warm for a bath, the boys will need an hour or so to heat it.”\n“Running water?” Shallan said, eager. She’d seen this for the first time\nin Kharbranth.\n“As I said, storm cistern.” Palona pointed upward. “Each highstorm fills\nit, and the shape of the cistern sifts out the crem. Don’t use the system until\nmidday after a highstorm, or the water will be brown. And you look entirely\ntoo eager about this.”\n“Sorry,” Shallan said. “We didn’t have this sort of thing in Jah Keved.”\n“Welcome to civilization. I trust you left your club and loincloth at the\ndoor. Let me set to finding you a maid.” The short woman started to leave.\n“Palona?” Shallan asked.\n“Yes, child?”\n“Thank you.”\nPalona smiled. “Winds know, you’re not the first stray he’s brought\nhome. Some of us even end up staying.” She left.\nShallan sat down on the plush, white bed, and sank almost down to her\nneck. What had they made the thing out of? Air and wishes? It felt\nluxurious.\nIn her sitting room—her sitting room—thumps announced the footmen"

They left a moment later, closing the door. For the\nfirst time in quite a long while, Shallan found herself not fighting for her\nsurvival or worrying about being murdered by one of her traveling\ncompanions.\nSo she fell asleep.\n41. Scars\nThis act of great villainy went beyond the\nimpudence which had hitherto been ascribed to\nthe orders; as the fighting was particularly intense\nat this time, many attributed this act to a sense of\ninherent betrayal; and after they withdrew, about\ntwo thousand made assault upon them, destroying\nmuch of the membership; but this was only nine of\nthe ten, as one said they would not abandon their\narms and flee, but instead entertained great\nsubterfuge at the expense of the other nine.\nFrom Words of Radiance, chapter 38, page\n20\nKaladin rested his fingers on the chasm wall as Bridge Seventeen\nformed up behind him.\nHe remembered being frightened of these chasms when he first\ndescended into them. He had feared that heavy rains would cause a flash\nflood while his men were scavenging. He was a little surprised Gaz hadn’t\nfound a way to “accidentally” get Bridge Four assigned to chasm duty on\nthe day of a highstorm.\nBridge Four had embraced its punishment, claiming these pits. Kaladin\nwas startled to realize that coming down here felt more like coming home\nthan returning to Hearthstone and his parents would have. The chasms were\nhis.\n“The lads are ready, sir,” Teft said, stepping up beside him.\n“Where were you the other night?” Kaladin asked, looking up toward\nthe crack of open sky above.\n“I was off duty, sir,” Teft said. “Went to see what I could find in the\nmarket. Do I need to report every little thing I do?”\n“You went to the market,” Kaladin said, “in a highstorm?”\n“Time may have gotten away from me for a breath or two…” Teft said,\nlooking away.\nKaladin wanted to press further, but Teft was entitled to his privacy.\nThey’re not bridgemen anymore. They don’t have to spend all of their time\ntogether. They’ll start having lives again.\nHe wanted to encourage that. Still, it was disturbing. If he didn’t know\nwhere they all were, how could he make sure they were all safe?\nHe turned around to regard Bridge Seventeen—a motley crew. Some\nhad been slaves, purchased for the bridges. Others had been criminals,\nthough the crimes punishable by bridge duty in Sadeas’s army could be\npractically anything. Falling into debt, insulting an officer, fighting.\n“You,” Kaladin said to the men, “are Bridge Seventeen, under the\ncommand of Sergeant Pitt. You are not soldiers. You may wear the\nuniforms, but they don’t fit you yet. You’re playing dress-up. We’re going\nto change that.”\nThe men shuffled and looked about. Though Teft had been working with\nthem and the other crews for weeks now, these didn’t yet see themselves as\nsoldiers. As long as that was true, they’d hold those spears at awkward"

As long as that was true, they’d hold those spears at awkward\nangles, look around lazily when being addressed, and shuffle in line.\n“The chasms are mine,” Kaladin said. “I give you leave to practice here.\nSergeant Pitt!”\n“Yes, sir!” Pitt said, standing at attention.\n“This is a sloppy mess of stormleavings you’ve got to work with, but\nI’ve seen worse.”\n“I find that hard to believe, sir!”\n“Believe it,” Kaladin said, looking over the men. “I was in Bridge Four.\nLieutenant Teft, they’re yours. Make them sweat.”\n“Aye, sir,” Teft said. He began to call out orders as Kaladin picked up\nhis spear and made his way farther down the chasms. It would be slow\ngoing, getting all twenty crews into shape, but at least Teft had successfully\ntrained the sergeants. Heralds send that the same training worked on the\ncommon men.\nKaladin wished he could explain, even to himself, why he felt so\nanxious about getting these men ready. He felt he was racing toward\nsomething. Though what, he didn’t know. That writing on the wall…\nStorms, it had him on edge. Thirty-seven days.\nHe passed Syl sitting on the frond of a frillbloom growing from the\nwall. It pulled closed at Kaladin’s approach. She didn’t notice, but remained\nsitting in the air.\n“What is it that you want, Kaladin?” she asked.\n“To keep my men alive,” he said immediately.\n“No,” Syl said, “that was what you wanted.”\n“You’re saying I don’t want them to be safe?”\nShe slid down onto his shoulder, moving like a stiff breeze had blown\nher. She crossed her legs, sitting ladylike, skirt rippling as he walked.\n“In Bridge Four, you dedicated everything you had to saving them,” Syl\nsaid. “Well, they’re saved. You can’t go about protecting every one like a…\num… Like a…”\n“Father kurl watches over his eggs?”\n“Exactly!” She paused. “What’s a kurl?”\n“A crustacean,” Kaladin said, “about the size of a small axehound.\nLooks kind of like a cross between a crab and a tortoise.”\n“Ooooo…” Syl said. “I wanna see one!”\n“They don’t live out here.”\nKaladin walked with his eyes forward, so she poked him in the neck\nuntil he looked at her. Then she rolled her eyes exaggeratedly. “So you\nadmit that your men are relatively safe,” she said. “That means you haven’t\nreally answered my question. What do you want?”\nHe passed piles of bones and wood, overgrown with moss. On one pile,\nrotspren and lifespren spun about one another, little motes of red and green\nglowing around the vines that sprouted incongruously from the mass of\ndeath.\n“I want to beat that assassin,” Kaladin said, surprised by how\nvehemently he felt it.\n“Why?”\n“Because it’s my job to protect Dalinar.”\nSyl shook her head. “That’s not it.”\n“What? You think you’ve gotten that good at reading human\nintentions?”"

Just you.”\nKaladin grunted, stepping carefully around the edge of a dark pool.\nHe’d rather not spend the rest of the day with soaked boots. These new ones\ndidn’t hold out the water as well as they should.\n“Maybe,” he said, “I want to beat that assassin because this is all his\nfault. If he hadn’t killed Gavilar, Tien wouldn’t have been drafted, and I\nwouldn’t have followed him. Tien wouldn’t have died.”\n“And you don’t think Roshone would have found another way of\ngetting back at your father?”\nRoshone was the citylord of Kaladin’s hometown back in Alethkar.\nSending Tien into the army had been an act of petty vengeance on his part,\na way to get back at Kaladin’s father for not being a good enough surgeon\nto save Roshone’s son.\n“He probably would have done something else,” Kaladin admitted.\n“Still, that assassin deserves to die.”\nHe heard the others before he reached them, their voices echoing down\nthe cavernous chasm bottom.\n“What I’m trying to explain,” one said, “is that nobody seems to be\nasking the right questions.” Sigzil’s voice, with his elevated Azish accent.\n“We call the Parshendi savages, and everyone says they hadn’t ever met\npeople until that day they encountered the Alethi expedition. If those things\nare true, then what storm brought them a Shin assassin? A Shin assassin\nwho can Surgebind, no less.”\nKaladin stepped into the light of their spheres sprinkled about on the\nfloor of the chasm, which had been cleared of debris since the last time\nKaladin had been here. Sigzil, Rock, and Lopen sat on boulders, waiting for\nhim.\n“Are you implying that the Assassin in White never really worked for\nthe Parshendi?” Kaladin asked. “Or are you implying that the Parshendi lied\nabout being as isolated as they claimed?”\n“I’m not implying anything,” Sigzil said, turning toward Kaladin. “My\nmaster trained me to ask questions, so I’m asking them. Something doesn’t\nmake sense about this whole matter. The Shin are extremely xenophobic.\nThey rarely leave their lands, and you never find them working as\nmercenaries. Now this one goes about assassinating kings? With a\nShardblade? Is he still working for the Parshendi? If so, why did they wait\nso long to unleash him against us again?”\n“Does it matter who he’s working for?” Kaladin asked, sucking in\nStormlight.\n“Of course it does,” Sigzil said.\n“Why?”\n“Because it’s a question,” he said, as if offended. “Besides, discovering\nhis true employer might give us a clue to their goal, and knowing that might\nhelp us defeat him.”\nKaladin smiled, then tried to run up the wall.\nAfter falling to the ground, ending up flat on his back, he sighed.\nRock’s head leaned in over him. “Is fun to watch,” he said. “But this\nthing, you are certain she can work?”"

He could\nhave sprayed the ceiling with Stormlight, then jumped up into it to stick\nthere.”\n“No,” Kaladin said, Stormlight escaping his lips. “He jumped up and\nlanded on the ceiling. Then he ran down the wall and sent Adolin to the\nceiling somehow. The prince didn’t stick there, he fell that way.” Kaladin\nwatched his Stormlight rise and evaporate. “At the end of it all, the\nassassin… he flew away.”\n“Ha!” Lopen said from his rock perch. “I knew it. When we have this\nfigured out, the king of all Herdaz, he will say to me, ‘Lopen, you are\nglowing, and this is impressive. But you can also fly. For this, you may\nmarry my daughter.’”\n“The king of Herdaz doesn’t have a daughter,” Sigzil said.\n“He doesn’t? I have been lied to all this time!”\n“You don’t know your royal family?” Kaladin asked, sitting up.\n“Gon, I haven’t been to Herdaz since I was a baby. There are as many\nHerdazians in Alethkar and Jah Keved these days as there are in our\nhomeland. Flick my sparks, I’m practically an Alethi! Only not so tall and\nnot so grouchy.”\nRock gave Kaladin a hand and pulled him to his feet. Syl had taken a\nperch on the wall.\n“Do you know how this works?” Kaladin asked her.\nShe shook her head.\n“But the assassin is a Windrunner,” Kaladin said.\n“I think?” Syl said. “Something like you? Maybe?” She shrugged.\nSigzil followed the direction that Kaladin was looking. “I wish I could\nsee it,” he mumbled. “It would be a— Gah!” He jumped backward,\npointing. “It looks like a little person!”\nKaladin raised an eyebrow toward Syl.\n“I like him,” she said. “Also, Sigzil, I’m a ‘she’ and not an ‘it,’ thank\nyou very much.”\n“Spren have genders?” Sigzil asked, amazed.\n“Of course,” she said. “Though, technically, it probably has something\nto do with the way people view us. Personification of the forces of nature or\nsome similar gobbletyblarthy.”\n“Doesn’t that bother you?” Kaladin asked. “That you might be a\ncreation of human perception?”\n“You’re a creation of your parents. Who cares how we were born? I can\nthink. That’s good enough.” She grinned in a mischievous way, then zipped\ndown as a ribbon of light toward Sigzil, who had settled down on a rock\nwith a stunned expression. She stopped right in front of him, returned to the\nform of a young woman, then leaned in and made her face look exactly like\nhis."

She stopped right in front of him, returned to the\nform of a young woman, then leaned in and made her face look exactly like\nhis.\n“Gah!” Sigzil cried again, scrambling away, making her giggle and\nchange her face back.\nSigzil looked toward Kaladin. “She talks… She talks like a real person.”\nHe raised a hand to his head. “The stories say the Nightwatcher might be\ncapable of that… Powerful spren. Vast spren.”\n“Is he calling me vast?” Syl said, cocking her head to the side. “Not\nsure what I think of that.”\n“Sigzil,” Kaladin said, “could the Windrunners fly?”\nThe man gingerly sat back down, still staring at Syl. “Stories and lore\naren’t my specialty,” he said. “I tell of different places, to make the world\nsmaller and to help men understand each other. I’ve heard legends speak of\npeople dancing on the clouds, but who is to say what is fancy and what is\ntruth, from stories so old?”\n“We’ve got to figure this out,” Kaladin said. “The assassin will return.”\n“So,” Rock said, “jump at wall some more. I will not laugh much.” He\nsettled down on a boulder and plucked a small crab off the ground beside\nhim. He inspected it, then popped it into his mouth and began chewing.\n“Ew,” Sigzil said.\n“Tastes good,” Rock said, speaking with his mouth full. “But better with\nsalt and oil.”\nKaladin regarded the wall, then closed his eyes and drew in more\nStormlight. He felt it inside of him, beating against the walls of his veins\nand arteries, trying to escape. Daring him forward. To jump, to move, to do.\n“So,” Sigzil said to the others, “are we assuming that the Assassin in\nWhite was the one who sabotaged the king’s railing?”\n“Bah,” Rock said. “Why would he do this thing? He could kill more\neasily.”\n“Yeah,” Lopen agreed. “Maybe the railing was done by one of the other\nhighprinces.”\nKaladin opened his eyes and looked at his arm, palm against the slick\nwall of the chasm, elbow straight. Stormlight rose from his skin. Curling\nwisps of Light that vaporized in the air.\nRock nodded. “All highprinces want the king dead, though they will not\nspeak of this. One of them sent saboteur.”\n“So how did this saboteur get to the balcony?” Sigzil asked. “It must\nhave taken some time to cut through the railing. It was metal. Unless…\nHow smooth was that cut, Kaladin?”\nKaladin narrowed his eyes, watching that Stormlight rise. It was raw\npower. No. “Power” was the wrong term. It was a force, like the Surges that\nruled the universe. They made fire burn, made rocks fall, made light glow.\nThese wisps, they were the Surges reduced to some primal form.\nHe could use it. Use it to…\n“Kal?” Sigzil’s voice asked, though it seemed distant. Like an\nunimportant buzzing. “How smooth was the cut to the railing? Could it\nhave been a Shardblade?”"

For a moment, Kaladin thought he saw shadows of a\nworld that was not, shadows of another place. And in that place, a distant\nsky with a sun enclosed, almost as if by a corridor of clouds.\nThere.\nHe made the direction of the wall become down.\nSuddenly, his arm was all that was supporting him. He fell forward into\nthe wall, grunting. His awareness of his surroundings returned in a crash—\nonly, his perspective was bizarre. He scrambled to his feet, and found\nhimself standing on the wall.\nHe backed up a few paces—walking up the side of the chasm. To him,\nthat wall was the floor, and the other three bridgemen stood on the actual\nfloor, which looked like the wall…\nThis, Kaladin thought, is going to get confusing.\n“Wow,” Lopen said, standing up excitedly. “Yeah, this is really going to\nbe fun. Run up the wall, gancho!”\nKaladin hesitated, then turned and started running. It was like he was in\na cave, the two walls of the chasm the top and bottom. Those slowly\nsqueezed together as he moved toward the sky.\nFeeling the rush of the Stormlight within him, Kaladin grinned. Syl\nstreaked along beside him, laughing. The closer they got to the top, the\nnarrower the chasm became. Kaladin slowed, then stopped.\nSyl streaked out in front of him, zipping out of the chasm as if leaping\nfrom the mouth of the cave. She turned about, a ribbon of light.\n“Come on!” she called to him. “Out onto the plateau! Into the sunlight!”\n“There are scouts out there,” he said, “watching for gemhearts.”\n“Come out anyway. Stop hiding, Kaladin. Be.”\nLopen and Rock whooped below in excitement. Kaladin stared outward\nat the blue sky. “I have to know,” he whispered.\n“Know?”\n“You ask me why I protect Dalinar. I have to know if he really is what\nhe seems, Syl. I have to know if one of them lives up to his reputation. That\nwill tell me—”\n“Tell you?” she asked, becoming the image of a full-size young woman\nstanding on the wall before him. She was nearly as tall as he was, her dress\nfading to mist. “Tell you what?”\n“If honor is dead,” Kaladin whispered.\n“He is,” Syl said. “But he lives on in men. And in me.”\nKaladin frowned.\n“Dalinar Kholin is a good man,” Syl said.\n“He is friends with Amaram. He could be the same, inside.”\n“You don’t believe that.”\n“I have to know, Syl,” he said, stepping forward. He tried to take her\narm as he would a human’s, but she was too insubstantial. His hand passed\nthrough. “I can’t just believe it. I need to know it. You asked what I want.\nWell, that’s it. I want to know if I can trust Dalinar. And if I can…”"

Like Roshone did. Like\nAmaram did. Like Sadeas did.”\n“And that is what it will take?” she asked.\n“I warned you that I was broken, Syl.”\n“No. You’ve been reforged. It can happen to men.”\n“To other men, yes,” Kaladin said, raising his hand, feeling the scars on\nhis forehead. Why had the Stormlight never healed those? “I’m not certain\nabout myself yet. But I will protect Dalinar Kholin with everything I have. I\nwill learn who he is, who he really is. Then, maybe… we’ll give him his\nKnights Radiant.”\n“And Amaram? What of him?”\nPain. Tien. “Him I’m going to kill.”\n“Kaladin,” she said, hands clasped before her, “don’t let this destroy\nyou.”\n“It can’t,” he said, Stormlight running out. His uniform coat began to\nfall backward, toward the ground, as did his hair. “Amaram already took\ncare of that.”\nThe ground below fully reasserted itself, and Kaladin fell backward\naway from her. He sucked in Stormlight, twisting in the air as his veins\nflared back to life. He landed feet-first in a rush of power and Light.\nThe other three remained silent for a few moments as he stood up\nstraight.\n“That,” Rock said, “was very fast way to get down. Ha! But it did not\ninclude falling on face, which would be fun. So you get only soft clap.” He\nproceeded to clap. It was indeed soft. Lopen, however, cheered and Sigzil\nnodded with a wide grin.\nKaladin snorted, grabbing a waterskin. “The king’s railing was cut with\na Shardblade, Sigzil.” He took a drink. “And no, it wasn’t the Assassin in\nWhite. That attempt on Elhokar’s life was too crude.”\nSigzil nodded.\n“What’s more,” Kaladin said, “the railing must have been cut after the\nhighstorm that night. Otherwise, the wind would have blown the railing out\nof shape. So our saboteur, a Shardbearer, somehow got out onto the balcony\nafter the storm.”\nLopen shook his head, catching the waterskin as Kaladin threw it back.\n“We’re supposed to believe that one of the camp’s Shardbearers snuck\nthrough the palace and got onto that balcony, gon? And nobody noticed\nhim?”\n“Could someone else do this thing?” Rock said, gesturing to the wall.\n“Walk up it?”\n“I doubt it,” Kaladin said.\n“A rope,” Sigzil said.\nThey looked to him.\n“If I wanted to sneak a Shardbearer in, I’d bribe some servant to let\ndown a rope.” Sigzil shrugged. “One could be smuggled out onto the railing\neasily, perhaps wrapped around the servant’s body under their clothing.

The\nsaboteur and maybe some friends could climb up the rope, cut the railing\nand dig at the mortar, then climb back down. The accomplice then cuts the\nrope and goes back inside.”\nKaladin nodded slowly.\n“So,” Rock said, “we find out who went on balcony after storm, and we\nfind accomplice. Easy! Ha. Maybe you are not airsick, Sigzil. No. Probably\njust a little.”\nKaladin felt unsettled. Moash had been out on that balcony between the\nstorm and the king’s near fall.\n“I’ll ask around,” Sigzil said, rising.\n“No,” Kaladin said quickly. “I’ll do it. Don’t speak a word of this to\nanyone else. I want to see what I can find.”\n“All right,” Sigzil said. He nodded toward the wall. “Can you do that\nagain?”\n“More tests?” Kaladin asked with a sigh.\n“We have time,” Sigzil said. “Besides, I believe Rock wants to see if\nyou fall on your face.”\n“Ha!”\n“All right,” Kaladin said. “But I’m going to have to drain some of those\nspheres we’re using for light.” He glanced toward them sitting in little piles\non the too-clean ground. “By the way, why did you clear away the rubble in\nthis area?”\n“Clear it away?” Sigzil asked.\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said. “There was no need to go moving remains\naround, even if they are just skeletons. It…”\nHe trailed off as Sigzil picked up a sphere and held it up toward the\nwall, exposing something Kaladin had missed before. Deep gouges where\nthe moss had been scraped off, the rock scored.\nChasmfiend. One of the massive greatshells had passed through the\narea, and its bulk had scraped everything away.\n“I didn’t think they came this close to the warcamps,” Kaladin said.\n“Maybe we shouldn’t train the lads down here for a while, just in case.”\nThe others nodded.\n“Is gone now,” Rock said. “Otherwise, we’d have been eaten. Is\nobvious. So, back to training.”\nKaladin nodded, though those gouges haunted him as he practiced.\n* * *\nA few hours later, they led a tired group of former bridgemen back into\ntheir barrack block. Exhausted as they looked, the men of Bridge Seventeen\nseemed more lively than they’d been before going down into the chasm.\nThey perked up even more when they reached their barrack and found one\nof Rock’s apprentice chefs fixing them a big pot of stew.\nIt was dark by the time Kaladin and Teft got back to Bridge Four’s own\nbarrack. Another of Rock’s apprentices was fixing the stew here, Rock\nhimself—having gotten back a little earlier than Kaladin—tasting and\ngiving criticism. Shen moved behind Rock, stacking bowls.\nSomething was wrong.\nKaladin stopped just outside the light of the firepit, and Teft froze\nbeside him. “Something is off,” Teft said.\n“Yeah,” Kaladin agreed, scanning the men.

They were clumped together\non one side of the fire, some seated, others standing in a group. Their\nlaughter forced, their postures nervous. When you trained men for war, they\nstarted to use combat stances whenever they were uncomfortable.\nSomething on the other side of that fire was a threat.\nKaladin stepped into the light and found a man sitting there in a nice\nuniform, hands down at his side, head bowed. Renarin Kholin. Oddly, he\nwas rocking back and forth with a small motion, staring at the ground.\nKaladin relaxed. “Brightlord,” Kaladin said, stepping over to him. “Is\nthere something you need?”\nRenarin scrambled to his feet and saluted. “I would like to serve under\nyour command, sir.”\nInside, Kaladin groaned. “Let’s talk away from the fire, Brightlord.” He\ntook the spindly prince by the arm, leading him away from the ears of the\nothers.\n“Sir,” Renarin said, speaking softly, “I want—”\n“You shouldn’t call me sir,” Kaladin whispered. “You’re lighteyed.\nStorms, you’re the son of the most powerful man in eastern Roshar.”\n“I want to be in Bridge Four,” Renarin said.\nKaladin rubbed his forehead. During his time as a slave, dealing with\nmuch larger problems, he had forgotten about the headaches of dealing with\nhighborn lighteyes. Once, he might have assumed he’d heard the most\noutlandish of their ridiculous demands. Not so, it seemed.\n“You can’t be in Bridge Four. We’re bodyguards for your own family.\nWhat are you going to do? Guard yourself?”\n“I won’t be a liability, sir. I’ll work hard.”\n“I don’t doubt you would, Renarin. Look, why do you want to be in\nBridge Four?”\n“My father and my brother,” Renarin said softly, face shadowed,\n“they’re warriors. Soldiers. I’m not, if you haven’t noticed.”\n“Yes. Something about…”\n“Physical ailments,” Renarin said. “I’ve a blood weakness.”\n“That’s a folk description of many different conditions,” Kaladin said.\n“What do you really have?”\n“I’m epileptic,” Renarin said. “It means—”\n“Yes, yes. Is it idiopathic or symptomatic?”\nRenarin stood absolutely still in the darkness. “Uh…”\n“Was it caused by a specific brain injury,” Kaladin asked, “or is it\nsomething that just started happening for no reason?”\n“I’ve had it since I was a kid.”\n“How bad are the seizures?”\n“They’re fine,” Renarin said quickly. “It’s not as bad as everyone says.\nIt’s not like I fall to the ground or froth like everyone thinks. My arm will\njerk a few times, or I’ll twitch uncontrollably for a few moments.”\n“You retain consciousness?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Myoclonic, probably,” Kaladin said. “You’ve been given bitterleaf to\nchew?”\n“I… Yes.

Aren’t you a soldier?”\n“I know some field medicine.”\n“Field medicine… for epilepsy?”\nKaladin coughed into his hand. “Well, I can see why they didn’t want\nyou going into battle. I’ve seen men with wounds that caused similar\nsymptoms, and the surgeons always dismissed those men from duty. It’s no\nshame to not be fit enough for battle, Brightlord. Not every man is needed\nfor fighting.”\n“Sure,” Renarin said bitterly. “Everyone tells me that. Then they all go\nback to fighting. The ardents, they claim every Calling is important, but\nthen what do they teach about the afterlife? That it’s a big war to reclaim\nthe Tranquiline Halls. That the best soldiers in this life are glorified in the\nnext.”\n“If the afterlife really is a big war,” Kaladin said, “then I hope I end up\nin Damnation. At least there I might be able to get a wink or two of sleep.\nRegardless, you’re no soldier.”\n“I want to be.”\n“Brightlord—”\n“You don’t have to set me to doing anything important,” Renarin said.\n“I came to you, instead of one of the other battalions, because most of your\nmen spend their time patrolling. If I’m patrolling, I won’t be in much\ndanger, and my fits won’t hurt anyone. But at least I can see, I can feel what\nit’s like.”\n“I—”\nHe rushed on. Kaladin had never heard so many words from the\nnormally quiet young man.\n“I will obey your commands,” Renarin said. “Treat me like a new\nrecruit. When I’m here, I’m not a prince’s son, I’m not a lighteyes. I’m just\nanother soldier. Please. I want to be part of it. When Adolin was young, my\nfather made him serve in a spearman squad for two months.”\n“He did?” Kaladin asked, genuinely surprised.\n“Father said every officer should serve in the shoes of his men,”\nRenarin said. “I have Shards now. I’m going to be in war, but I’ve never felt\nwhat it’s like to really be a soldier. I think this is the closest I’ll be able to\nget. Please.”\nKaladin folded his arms, looking the youth over. Renarin looked\nanxious. Very anxious. He’d formed his hands to fists, though Kaladin could\nsee no sign of the box Renarin often fiddled with when nervous. He’d\nbegun breathing deeply, but had set his jaw, and kept his eyes forward.\nComing to see Kaladin, to ask this of him, terrified the young man for\nsome reason. He’d done it anyway.

And yet, one of\nKaladin’s jobs was to protect Renarin. If he could pound some solid self-\ndefense skills into him, that would go a long way toward helping him\nsurvive assassination attempts.\n“I should probably point out,” Renarin said, “how much easier it will be\nto guard me if I’m spending time training with your men. Your resources\nare thin, sir. Having one fewer person to protect must be appealing. The\nonly times I’ll leave are the days when I practice with my Shards under\nSwordmaster Zahel.”\nKaladin sighed. “You really want to be a soldier?”\n“Yes, sir!”\n“Go take those dirty stew bowls and wash them,” Kaladin said,\npointing. “Then help Rock clean his cauldron and put away the cooking\nimplements.”\n“Yes, sir!” Renarin said with an enthusiasm Kaladin had never heard\nfrom anyone assigned washing duty. Renarin jogged over and began\nhappily snatching up bowls.\nKaladin folded his arms and leaned against the barrack. The men didn’t\nknow how to react to Renarin. They’d hand over bowls of half-finished\nstew to please him, and conversation hushed when he was too near. But\nthey’d been nervous around Shen too, before eventually coming to accept\nhim. Could they ever do the same for a lighteyes?\nMoash had refused to hand his bowl to Renarin, washing it himself, as\nwas their common practice. Once done, he strolled over to Kaladin. “You’re\nreally going to let him join?”\n“I’ll speak to his father tomorrow,” Kaladin said. “Get the highprince’s\nread on it.”\n“I don’t like it. Bridge Four, our nightly conversations… these things\nare supposed to be safe from them, you know?”\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said. “But he’s a good kid. I think if any lighteyes\ncould fit in here, he could.”\nMoash turned, raising an eyebrow toward him.\n“You disagree, I presume?” Kaladin asked.\n“He doesn’t act right, Kal. The way he talks, the way he looks at people.\nHe’s strange. That’s not important, though—he’s lighteyed, and that should\nbe enough. It means we can’t trust him.”\n“We don’t need to,” Kaladin said. “We’re just going to keep an eye on\nhim, maybe try to train him to defend himself.”\nMoash grunted, nodding. He seemed to accept those as good reasons for\nletting Renarin stay.\nI’ve got Moash here, Kaladin thought. Nobody else is close enough to\nhear. I should ask…\nBut how did he form the words? Moash, were you involved in a plot to\nkill the king?\n“Have you thought about what we’re going to do?” Moash asked.\n“Regarding Amaram, I mean.”\n“Amaram is my problem.”\n“You’re Bridge Four,” Moash said, taking Kaladin by the arm. “Your\nproblem is our problem. He’s the one who made you a slave.”\n“He did more than that,” Kaladin growled softly, ignoring Syl’s\ngesturing that he should remain quiet. “He killed my friends, Moash. Right"

He’s a murderer.”\n“Then something has to be done.”\n“It does,” Kaladin asked. “But what? You think I should go to the\nauthorities?”\nMoash laughed. “What are they going to do? You have to get the man\ninto a duel, Kaladin. Bring him down, man against man. Until you do it,\nsomething’s going to feel wrong to you, deep down in your gut.”\n“You sound like you know what this feels like.”\n“Yeah.” Moash gave a little half smile. “I have some Voidbringers in my\npast too. Maybe that’s why I understand you. Maybe that’s why you\nunderstand me.”\n“Then what—”\n“I don’t really want to talk about it,” Moash said.\n“We’re Bridge Four,” Kaladin said, “like you said. Your problems are\nmine.” What did the king do to your family, Moash?\n“Suppose that’s true,” Moash said, turning away. “I just… Not tonight.\nTonight, I just want to relax.”\n“Moash!” Teft called from nearer the fire. “You coming?”\n“I am,” Moash called back. “What about you, Lopen? You ready?”\nLopen grinned, standing up and stretching beside the fire. “I am the\nLopen, which means I am ready for anything at any time. You should know\nthis by now.”\nNearby, Drehy snorted and flipped a chunk of stewed longroot at Lopen.\nIt splatted against the Herdazian’s face.\nLopen kept right on talking. “As you can see, I was perfectly ready for\nthat, as shown by the poise I display as I make this decidedly rude gesture.”\nTeft chuckled as he, Peet, and Sigzil walked over to join Lopen. Moash\nmoved to go with them, then hesitated. “You coming, Kal?”\n“Where?” Kaladin asked.\n“Out,” Moash said, shrugging. “Visit a few taverns, play some rings, get\nsomething to drink.”\nOut. The bridgemen had rarely done such things in Sadeas’s army, at\nleast not as a group, with friends. At first, they had been too beaten down to\ncare for anything other than sticking their noses in drink. Later, lack of\nfunds and the general prejudice against them among the troops had worked\nto keep the bridgemen to themselves.\nThat wasn’t the case any longer. Kaladin found himself stammering.\n“I… probably ought to stay… uh, to go look in at the fires of the other\ncrews…”\n“Come on, Kal,” Moash said. “You can’t always work.”\n“I’ll go with you another time.”\n“Fine.” Moash jogged over to join the others.\nSyl left the fire, where she’d been dancing with a flamespren, and\nzipped over to Kaladin. She hung in the air, watching the group walk off\ninto the evening.\n“Why didn’t you go?” she asked him.\n“I can’t live that life anymore, Syl,” Kaladin said. “I wouldn’t know\nwhat to do with myself.”\n“But—”"

She opened her eyes, finding herself\nsnuggled into the luxurious bed in Sebarial’s manor. She’d fallen asleep in\nher clothing.\nThe humming was Pattern on the comforter beside her. He looked\nalmost like lace embroidery. The window shades had been drawn—she\ndidn’t remember doing that—and it was dark outside. The evening of the\nday she’d arrived at the Plains.\n“Did someone come in?” she asked Pattern, sitting up, pushing stray\nlocks of red hair from her eyes.\n“Mmm. Someones. Gone now.”\nShallan rose and wandered into her sitting room. Ash’s eyes, she almost\ndidn’t want to walk on the pristine white carpeting. What if she left tracks\nand ruined it?\nPattern’s “someones” had left food on the table. Suddenly ravenous,\nShallan sat down on the sofa, lifting the lid off the tray to find flatbread that\nhad been baked with sweet paste in the center, along with dipping sauces.\n“Remind me,” she said, “to thank Palona in the morning. That woman is\ndivine.”\n“Mmm. No. I think she is… Ah… Exaggeration?”\n“You catch on quickly,” Shallan said as Pattern became a three-\ndimensional mass of twisting lines, a ball hanging in the air above the seat\nbeside her.\n“No,” he said. “I am too slow. You prefer some food and not others.\nWhy?”\n“The taste,” Shallan said.\n“I should understand this word,” Pattern said. “But I do not, not really.”\nStorms. How did you describe taste? “It’s like color… you see with\nyour mouth.” She grimaced. “And that was an awful metaphor. Sorry. I\nhave trouble being insightful on an empty stomach.”\n“You say you are ‘on’ the stomach,” Pattern said. “But I know you do\nnot mean this. Context allows me to infer what you truly mean. In a way,\nthe very phrase is a lie.”\n“It’s not a lie,” Shallan said, “if everyone understands and knows what\nit means.”\n“Mm. Those are some of the best lies.”\n“Pattern,” Shallan said, breaking off a piece of flatbread, “sometimes\nyou’re about as intelligible as a Bavlander trying to quote ancient Vorin\npoetry.”\nA note beside the food said that Vathah and her soldiers had arrived, and\nhad been quartered in a tenement nearby.

Her slaves had been incorporated\ninto the manor’s staff for the time being.\nChewing on the bread—it was delightful—Shallan went over to her\ntrunks with the intent of unpacking. When she opened the first, however,\nshe was confronted by a blinking red light. Tyn’s spanreed.\nShallan stared at it. That would be the person who relayed Tyn’s\ninformation. Shallan assumed it was a woman, though since the information\nrelay station was in Tashikk, they might not even be Vorin. It could be a\nman.\nShe knew so little. She was going to have to be very careful… storms,\nshe might get herself killed even if she was careful. Shallan was tired,\nhowever, of being pushed around.\nThese people knew something about Urithiru. It was, dangerous or not,\nShallan’s best lead. She took out the spanreed, prepared its board with\npaper, and placed the reed. Once she turned the dial to indicate she had set\nup, the pen remained hanging there, immobile, but did not immediately start\nwriting. The person trying to contact her had stepped away—the pen could\nhave been in there blinking for hours. She’d have to wait until the person on\nthe other side returned.\n“Inconvenient,” she said, then smiled at herself. Was she really\ncomplaining about waiting a few minutes for instantaneous communication\nacross half the world?\nI will need to find a way to contact my brothers, she thought. That\nwould be distressingly slow, without a spanreed. Could she arrange a\nmessage through one of these relay stations in Tashikk using a different\nintermediary, perhaps?\nShe settled back down on the couch—pen and writing board near the\ntray of food—and looked through the stack of previous communications\nthat Tyn had exchanged with this distant person. There weren’t many. Tyn\nhad probably destroyed them periodically. The ones remaining involved\nquestions regarding Jasnah, House Davar, and the Ghostbloods.\nOne oddity stood out to Shallan. The way Tyn spoke of this group\nwasn’t like that of a thief and one-off employers. Tyn spoke of “getting in\ngood” and “moving up” within the Ghostbloods.\n“Pattern,” Pattern said.\n“What?” Shallan asked, looking toward him.\n“Pattern,” he replied. “In the words. Mmm.”\n“Of this sheet?” Shallan asked, holding up the page.\n“There and others,” Pattern said. “See the first words?”\nShallan frowned, inspecting the sheets. In each one, the first words\ncame from the remote writer. A simple sentence asking after Tyn’s health or\nstatus. Tyn replied simply each time.\n“I don’t understand,” Shallan said.\n“They form groups of five,” Pattern said. “Quintets, the letters. Mmm.\nEach message follows a pattern—first three words start with one each of\nthree of the quintet of letters. Tyn’s reply, the two that match.”\nShallan looked it over, though she couldn’t see what Pattern meant. He\nexplained it again, and she thought she grasped it, but the pattern was\ncomplex."

It made sense; you’d want a way to authenticate\nthat the right person was on the other end of the spanreed. She blushed as\nshe realized she had almost ruined this opportunity. If Pattern hadn’t seen\nthis, or if the spanreed had started writing immediately, Shallan would have\nexposed herself.\nShe couldn’t do this. She couldn’t infiltrate a group skilled and powerful\nenough to bring down Jasnah herself. She just couldn’t.\nAnd yet she had to.\nShe got out her sketchbook and started to draw, letting her fingers move\non their own. She needed to be older, but not too much older. She’d be\ndarkeyed. People would remark upon a lighteyes they didn’t know moving\nthrough camp. A darkeyes would be more invisible. To the right people,\nthough, she could imply that she was using the eyedrops.\nDark hair. Long, like her real hair, but not red. Same height, same build,\nbut a much different face. Worn features, like Tyn’s. A scar across the chin,\na more angular face. Not as pretty, but not ugly either. More…\nstraightforward.\nShe sucked in Stormlight from the lamp beside her, and that energy\nmade her draw more quickly. It wasn’t excitement. It was a need to go\nforward.\nShe finished with a flourish, and found a face staring back at her from\nthe page, almost alive. Shallan breathed out Light and felt it envelop her,\ntwist about her. Her vision clouded for a moment, and she saw only the\nglow of that fading Stormlight.\nThen it was gone. She didn’t feel any different. She prodded at her face.\nIt felt the same. Had she—\nThe lock of hair hanging down over her shoulder was black. Shallan\nstared at it, then rose from her seat, eager and timid at the same time. She\ncrossed to the washroom and stepped up to the mirror there, looking at a\nface transformed, one with tan skin and dark eyes. The face from her\ndrawing, given color and life.\n“It works…” she whispered. This was more than changing scuffs in her\ndress or making herself look older, as she’d done before. This was a\ncomplete transformation. “What can we do with this?”\n“Whatever we imagine,” Pattern said from the wall nearby. “Or\nwhatever you can imagine. I am not good with what is not. But I like it. I\nlike the… taste… of it.” He seemed very pleased with himself at that\ncomment.\nSomething was off. Shallan frowned, holding up her sketch, realizing\nshe’d left a spot unfinished on the side of the nose. The Lightweaving there\ndidn’t cover up her nose completely, and had a kind of fuzzy gap in the\nside. It was small; someone else would probably just see it as a strange scar.\nTo her, it seemed glaring, and offended her artistic sense.\nShe prodded at the rest of the nose. She’d made it slightly larger than\nher real one, and could reach through the image to touch her nose. The\nimage had no substance to it. In fact, if she moved her finger quickly"

Sloppy drawing on her part.\n“How long will the image last?” she asked.\n“It feeds on Light,” Pattern said.\nShallan dug the spheres from her safepouch. They were all dun—she’d\nlikely used those up in the conversation with the highprinces. She took one\nfrom the lamp on the wall, replacing it with a dun sphere of the same\ndenomination, and carried it in her fist.\nShallan went back into the sitting room. She’d need a different outfit, of\ncourse. A darkeyed woman wouldn’t—\nThe spanreed was writing.\nShallan hastened over to the sofa, breath catching as she saw the words\nappear. I think some information I have today will work. A simple\nintroduction, but it followed the right pattern for the code.\n“Mmm,” Pattern said.\nShe needed the first two words of her reply to start with the proper\nletters. But you said that last time, she wrote, hopefully completing the\ncode.\nDon’t worry, the messenger wrote. You’ll like this, though the timing\nmight be tight.

She’d taken to it quickly, as\nit was a kind of drawing, but Tyn’s suggestions now let her imitate the\nwoman’s own sloppier writing with demonstrable skill.\nThey want to meet tonight, Tyn, the reed wrote.\nTonight? What time was it? A clock on the wall read half past first night\nbell. It was just first moon, right after dark. She picked up the spanreed and\nstarted to write, “I don’t know if I’m ready,” but stopped herself. That\nwasn’t how Tyn would say it.\nI’m not ready, she wrote instead.\nThey were insistent, the messenger returned. It is why I tried to contact\nyou earlier. Apparently, Jasnah’s ward arrived today. What happened?\nIt is none of your concern, Shallan wrote back, matching the tone Tyn\nhad used previously in these conversations. The person on the other end\nwas a servant, not a colleague.\nOf course, the reed wrote. But they want to meet you tonight. If you\nrefuse, it might mean a severing of ties.\nStormfather! Tonight? Shallan ran her fingers through her hair, staring\nat the page. Could she do it tonight?\nWould waiting really change anything?\nHeart thumping, she wrote, I thought I had Jasnah’s ward captive, but\nthe girl betrayed me. I’m not well. But I will send my apprentice.\nAnother one, Tyn? the reed wrote. After what happened with Si?\nAnyway, I doubt they’ll like meeting with an apprentice.\nThey don’t have a choice, Shallan wrote.\nPerhaps she could have created a Lightweaving around herself that\nmade her look like Tyn, but she doubted she was ready for something like"

Salas’s moonheight? She’d\nhave twenty-five minutes, and she didn’t know the camp at all. Shallan\nleaped to her feet, then froze. She couldn’t go like this, dressed as a\nlighteyed woman. She hurried to Tyn’s trunk and dug through clothing.\nA few minutes later she stood in front of the mirror, wearing loose\nbrown trousers, a white buttoned shirt, and a thin glove on her safehand.\nShe felt naked with her hand exposed like that. The trousers weren’t so bad\n—darkeyed women wore them when working the plantation back home,\nthough she’d never seen a lighteyed lady in them. But that glove…\nShe shivered, noticing that her false face blushed when she did. The\nnose moved when she wrinkled her own as well. That was a good thing,\nthough she’d been hoping to be able to hide her embarrassment.\nShe pulled on one of Tyn’s white coats. The stiff thing went all the way\ndown to the top of her boots, and she tied it at the waist with a thick black\nhogshide belt so that it was mostly closed in front, as Tyn had worn it. She\nfinished by replacing the spheres in the pouch in her pocket with infused\nones from the lamps in the room.\nThat flaw in her nose still bothered her. Something to shade the face, she\nthought, hurrying back to her trunk. There, she dug out Bluth’s white hat,\nthe one with the sides that folded upward at a slant. Hopefully it would look\nbetter on her than it had on Bluth.\nShe put it on, and when she returned to the mirror, she was pleased with\nhow it shaded her face. It did look kind of silly. But then, she felt that\neverything about this outfit looked silly. A gloved hand? Trousers? The coat\nhad seemed imposing on Tyn—it indicated experience and a sense of\npersonal style. When Shallan wore it, she looked like she was pretending.\nShe saw through the illusion to the frightened girl from rural Jah Keved.\nAuthority is not a real thing. Jasnah’s words.

She wasn’t surprised; her\ntime in Kharbranth had taught her that not everyone treated the arrival of\nnight as a reason to stop working. Here, there were nearly as many people\nabout in the streets as when she’d first ridden through.\nAnd almost nobody paid attention to her.\nFor once, she didn’t feel conspicuous. Even in Kharbranth, people had\nglanced at her—noticed her, considered her. Some had thought of robbing\nher, others of how to use her. A young lighteyes without proper escort was\ndistinctive, and possibly an opportunity. However, while wearing straight\ndark hair and dark brown eyes, she might as well have been invisible. It was\nwonderful.\nShallan smiled, stuffing her hands in the pockets of her coat—she still\nfelt embarrassed by that gloved safehand, though nobody even looked at it.\nShe reached an intersection. In one direction, the warcamp glittered\nwith torches and oil lanterns. A market, busy enough that nobody trusted\nspheres in their lamps. Shallan walked toward it; she’d be safer on the more\ntraveled streets. Her fingers crinkled on the paper in her pocket, and she\ndrew it out as she stopped to wait for a group of chattering people to move\nfrom in front of her.\nThe map looked easy enough to parse. She just needed to get her\nbearings. She waited, then finally realized that the group in front of her\nwasn’t going to move. She was expecting them to defer to her as they would\na lighteyes. Shaking her head at her foolishness, she went around them.\nIt continued like that; she was forced to squeeze through tight places\nbetween bodies, and was jostled as she walked. This market flowed like two\nrivers passing one another, with shops on either side and vendors peddling\nfood in the center. It was even covered in some places by awnings that\nstretched across to the buildings on the other side.\nPerhaps only ten paces across, it was a claustrophobic, bustling,\njabbering mess.

Farther down the way, a Herdazian used a sparkflicker and some kind\nof oil to make bursts of flame in the air. If she could just stop off a little\ntime and do a sketch of him…\nNo. She had business to be about. Part of her didn’t want to go forward\nwith it, obviously, and her mind was trying to distract her. She was\nbecoming increasingly aware of this defense of hers. She used it, she\nneeded it, but she couldn’t let it control her life.\nShe did stop at the cart of a woman selling glazed fruit, however. They\nlooked juicy and red, and had been stabbed through with a little stick before\nbeing dipped in a glassy melted sugar. Shallan pulled a sphere from her\npocket and held it out.\nThe woman froze, staring at the sphere. Others stopped nearby. What\nwas the problem? It was just an emerald mark.

But that was on the level of houses and estates, not\nthe level of street vendors and working darkeyes.\n“Uh, I don’t think I can change that,” the woman said. “Er… citizen.” A\ntitle given to a wealthy darkeyes of the first or second nahn.\nShallan blushed. How many times was she going to prove just how\nnaive she was? “It’s for one of the treats, and for some help. I’m new to the\narea. I could use some directions.”\n“Expensive way to get directions, miss,” the woman said, but pocketed\nthe sphere with deft fingers nonetheless.\n“I need to find Nar Street.”\n“Ah. You’re going the wrong storming way, miss. Back up the market\nflow, turn right. You’ll need to go, uh, six blocks, I think? It’s easy to find;\nthe highprince made everyone lay out their buildings in squares, like in a\nproper city. Look for the taverns, and you’ll be there. But miss, I don’t think\nthat’s the sort of place one like you should be visiting, if you don’t mind me\nsaying.”\nEven as a darkeyes, people thought her incapable of taking care of\nherself. “Thank you,” Shallan said, plucking out one of the sticks of candied\nfruit. She hastened away, crossing the flow to join those walking in the\nopposite direction through the market.\n“Pattern?” she whispered."

She hastened away, crossing the flow to join those walking in the\nopposite direction through the market.\n“Pattern?” she whispered.\n“Mmm.” He was clinging to the outside of her coat, near the knees.\n“Trail behind and watch to see if anyone follows me,” Shallan said. “Do\nyou think you can do that?”\n“They will make a pattern if they come,” he said, dropping to the\nground. For a brief moment in the air, between coat and stone, he was a\ndark mass of twisting lines. Then he vanished like a drop of water hitting a\nlake.\nShallan hurried along with the flow, safehand securely gripping the\nsphere pouch in her coat pocket, freehand carrying the stick of fruit. She\nremembered all too well how Jasnah’s deliberate flashing of too much\nmoney in Kharbranth had lured thieves like vines to stormwater.\nShallan followed the directions, her sense of liberation replaced by\nanxiety. The corner she took out of the market led her to a roadway that was\nmuch less crowded. Was the fruit vendor trying to direct Shallan into a trap\nwhere she could be robbed easily? Head down, she hurried along the road.\nShe couldn’t Soulcast to protect herself, not as Jasnah had. Storms! Shallan\nhadn’t even been able to make sticks catch fire. She doubted she’d be able\nto transform living bodies.\nShe had Lightweaving, but she was already using that. Could she\nLightweave a second image at the same time? How was her disguise doing,\nanyway? It would be draining the Light from her spheres. She almost pulled\nthem out to see how much was gone, then stopped herself. Fool. She was\nworried about being robbed, and so she considered revealing a handful of\nmoney?\nShe stopped after two blocks. Some people did walk this street, a\nhandful of men in workers’ clothing heading home for the night. The\nbuildings here certainly weren’t as nice as the ones she’d left behind.\n“Nobody follows,” Pattern said from her feet.\nShallan jumped nearly to the rooftops. She raised her freehand to her\nbreast, breathing in and out deeply. She really thought she could infiltrate a\ngroup of assassins? Her own spren often made her jump.\nTyn said that nothing would teach me, Shallan thought, but personal\nexperience. I’m just going to have to muddle through these first few times\nand hope I get used to this before I get myself killed.\n“Let’s keep moving,” Shallan said. “We’re running out of time.” She\nstarted forward, digging into the fruit. It really was good, though her nerves\nprevented her from fully enjoying it.\nThe street with the taverns was actually five blocks away, not six.\nShallan’s increasingly wrinkled paper showed the meeting place as a\ntenement building across from a tavern with blue light shining through the\nwindows.\nShallan tossed aside her fruit stick as she stepped up to the tenement\nbuilding. It couldn’t be old—nothing in these warcamps could be more than\nfive or six years old—but it looked ancient. The stones weathered, the\nwindow shutters hanging askew in places.

She was surprised a highstorm\nhadn’t blown the thing over.\nFully aware that she could be striding into the whitespine’s den for\ndinner, she walked up and knocked. The door was opened by a darkeyed\nman the size of a boulder who had a beard trimmed like a Horneater’s. His\nhair did seem to have some red in it.\nShe resisted the urge to shuffle from one foot to the next as he looked\nher up and down. Finally, he opened the door all the way, motioning her in\nwith thick fingers. She didn’t miss the large axe that leaned against the wall\njust next to him, illuminated by the single feeble Stormlight lamp—it\nlooked like it only had a chip in it—on the wall.\nTaking a deep breath, Shallan entered.\nThe place smelled moldy. She heard water dripping from somewhere\nfarther inside, stormwater infallibly making its way from a leaking roof\ndown, down, down to the ground floor. The guard did not speak as he led\nher along the hall. The floor was wood. There was something about walking\non wood that made her feel as if she were going to fall through. It seemed to\ngroan with every step. Good stone never did anything like that.\nThe guard nodded toward an opening in the wall, and Shallan stared\ninto the blackness there. Steps. Down.\nStorms, what am I doing?\nNot being timid. That was what she was doing. Shallan glanced at the\nbrutish guard and raised an eyebrow, forcing her voice to sound calm. “You\nreally went all-out on the decor. How long did you have to look to find a\nden in the Shattered Plains that had a creepy staircase in it?”\nThe guard actually smiled. It didn’t make him look any less\nintimidating.\n“The stairs aren’t going to collapse under me, are they?” Shallan asked.\n“Is fine,” the guard said. His voice was surprisingly high pitched. “He\ndid not collapse for me, and I had two breakfasts today.” He patted his\nstomach. “Go. They wait for you.”\nShe got out a sphere for light and started down the stairwell. The stone\nwalls here had been cut. Who would go to the trouble to burrow out a\nbasement for a rotting tenement building? The answer came as she noticed\nseveral extended crem dribbles on the wall. A little like wax melting down\nthe side of a candle, these had hardened to stone long ago.\nThis hole was here before the Alethi came, she thought. When settling\nthis warcamp, Sebarial had built this building above an already-existent\nbasement. The warcamp craters must have once held people. There was no\nother explanation. Who had they been? The Natan people of long ago?\nThe steps led down into a small, empty room. How odd to find a\nbasement in such a ramshackle building; normally, you found them only in\nwealthy homes, as the precautions one needed to take to prevent flooding\nwere extensive. Shallan folded her arms, confused, until one corner of the\nfloor opened, bathing the room in light. Shallan stepped back, breath\ncatching. A part of the rock floor was false, hiding a trapdoor.\nThe basement had a basement. She stepped up to the edge of the hole"

She stepped up to the edge of the hole\nand saw a ladder heading down toward red carpet and light that seemed\nalmost blinding following the dimness she’d been in. This place must flood\nsomething fierce after a storm.\nShe swung onto the ladder and made her way down, glad for the\ntrousers. The trapdoor closed above—it appeared to have some sort of\npulley mechanism.\nShe hopped off onto the carpet and turned, finding a room that was\nincongruously palatial. A long dining table ran down the center, and it\nsparkled with glass goblets that had gemstones set in their sides; their glow\nsprayed the room with light. Cozy shelves lined the walls, each laden with\nbooks and ornaments. Many were in small glass cases. Trophies of some\nsort?\nOf the half-dozen or so people in the room, one drew her attention most.\nStraight-backed, with jet-black hair, he wore white clothing and stood in\nfront of the room’s crackling hearth. He reminded her of someone, a man\nfrom her childhood. The messenger with the smiling eyes, the enigma who\nknew so much. Two blind men waited at the end of an era, contemplating\nbeauty…\nThe man turned around, revealing light violet eyes and a face scarred by\nold wounds, including a cut that ran down his cheek and deformed his\nupper lip. Though he looked refined—holding a goblet of wine in his left\nhand and dressed in the finest of suits—his face and hands told another\nstory. Of battles, of killing, and of strife.\nThis was not the messenger from Shallan’s past. The man raised his\nright hand, in which he held some kind of long reed. He placed this to his\nlips. He held it like a weapon, pointed right at Shallan.\nShe froze in place, unable to move, staring down that weapon across the\nroom. Finally, she glanced over her shoulder. A target hung on the wall in\nthe form of a tapestry with various creatures on it. Shallan yelped and\njumped to the side just before the man blew on his weapon, shooting a\nsmall dart through the air. It passed within inches of her before embedding\nitself in one of the figures on the wall hanging.\nShallan raised her safehand to her breast and took a deep breath. Steady,\nshe thought at herself. Steady.\n“Tyn,” the man said, lowering the blowgun, “is unwell?” The quiet way\nhe spoke made Shallan shiver. She could not place his accent.\n“Yes,” Shallan said, finding her voice.\nThe man set his goblet on the mantel beside him, then slipped another\ndart from his shirt pocket. He tucked this carefully into the end of the\nblowgun. “She does not seem the type to let something so trivial keep her\nfrom an important meeting.”\nHe looked up at Shallan, blowgun loaded. Those violet eyes seemed like\nglass, his scarred face expressionless. The room seemed to hold its breath.\nHe’d seen through her lie. Shallan felt a cold sweat.\n“You are right,” Shallan said. “Tyn is well. However, the plan did not go"

Jasnah Kholin is dead, but the implementation of the\nassassination was sloppy. Tyn felt it prudent to work through an\nintermediary for now.”\nThe man narrowed his eyes, then finally raised his reed and blew\nsharply. Shallan jumped, but the dart did not strike her, instead flying to hit\nthe wall hanging.\n“She reveals herself as a coward,” he said. “You came here willingly,\nknowing that I might just kill you for her mistakes?”\n“Every woman starts somewhere, Brightlord,” Shallan said, voice\ntrembling rebelliously. “I can’t claw my way upward without taking a few\nchances. If you don’t kill me, then I have had a chance to meet people that\nTyn probably would never have introduced me to.”\n“Bold,” the man said. He gestured with two fingers, and one of the\npeople sitting beside the hearth—a spindly lighteyed man with teeth so\nlarge, he might have had some rat in his heritage somewhere—scrambled\nforward and plunked something down on the long table near Shallan.\nA sack of spheres. Inside it must be broams; the sack, though dark\nbrown, glowed brightly.\n“Tell me where she is, and you may have that money,” said the scarred\nman, loading another dart. “You have ambition. I like that. I will not only\npay you for her location, but will attempt to find you a position in my\norganization.”\n“Pardon, Brightlord,” Shallan said. “But you know I won’t sell her out\nto you.” Surely he could see her fear, sweat dampening the lining of her hat,\ntrickling down her temples. Indeed, fearspren wiggled up through the\nground beside her, though his view of them might be blocked by the table.\n“If I were willing to betray Tyn for a price, then of what worth would I ever\nbe to you? You’d know that I’d do the same to you, if offered a big enough\nbounty.”\n“Honor?” the man asked, expression still blank, dart pinched between\ntwo fingers. “From a thief?”\n“Pardon again, Brightlord,” Shallan said. “But I am no mere thief.”\n“And if I were to torture you? I could get the information that way, I\nassure you.”\n“I don’t doubt that you could, Brightlord,” Shallan said. “But do you\nreally think Tyn would send me with knowledge of her location? What\nwould be the point of torturing me?”\n“Well,” the man said, looking down and tucking the dart into place, “for\none thing, it would be fun.”\nBreathe, Shallan told herself. Slowly. Normally. It was hard to manage.\n“I don’t think you’ll do that, Brightlord.”\nHe raised the reed and blew with a swift motion. The dart thumped as it\nstuck into the wall. “And why not?”\n“Because you don’t seem the type to throw away something useful.”\nShe nodded toward the relics in glass boxes.\n“You presume to be of use to me?”\nShallan raised her head, meeting his gaze. “Yes.”"

The hearth crackled.\n“Very well,” he finally said, turning toward his fireplace and picking up\nhis cup again. He continued to hold the reed in one hand, but drank with the\nother, his back to her.\nShallan felt like a puppet whose strings had been cut. She exhaled in\nrelief, legs wobbling, and sat down on one of the chairs beside the dining\ntable. Fingers trembling, she got out a handkerchief and wiped her brow\nand temples, pushing back the hat.\nWhen she stopped to put the handkerchief away, she realized that\nsomeone had taken the seat beside her. Shallan hadn’t even seen him move,\nand his presence gave her a start. The short, tan-skinned person had some\nkind of carapace mask tied to his face, pulled tight. In fact, it looked like…\nlike the skin had started to grow around the edges of the mask somehow.\nThe arrangement of red-orange carapace pieces was like a mosaic,\ngiving a hint of eyebrows, of anger and rage. Behind that mask, a pair of\ndark eyes regarded her, unblinking, and an impassive mouth and chin were\nalso left exposed. The man… no, the woman—Shallan noticed the hint of\nbreasts and shape of the torso. The exposed safehand had thrown her.\nShallan stifled a blush. The woman wore dark brown clothing, simple,\ntied at the waist with an intricate belt, studded with more carapace. Four\nother people wearing more traditional Alethi clothing chatted softly beside\nthe fire. The tall man who had questioned her did not speak again.\n“Um, Brightlord?” Shallan said, looking toward him.\n“I am considering,” the man said. “I had been expecting to kill you and\nhunt down Tyn. You can tell her she would have been fine coming to me—I\nam not angry that she did not retrieve the information from Jasnah. I hired\nthe hunter I felt best for the task, and I understood the risks. Kholin is dead,\nand Tyn was to achieve that at all other costs. I may not have commended\nher on the job, but I was satisfied.\n“Deciding not to come explain in person, however—that cowardice\nturns my stomach. She hides, like prey.” He took a sip of his wine. “You are\nnot a coward. She sent someone she knew I would not kill. She always has\nbeen clever.”\nGreat. What did that mean for Shallan? She hesitantly rose from her\nseat, wanting to be away from the strange little woman with the unblinking\neyes. Instead, Shallan took the chance to inspect the room in greater detail.\nWhere was the smoke from the fire going? Had they cut a flue all the way\ndown here?\nThe right wall had the greater number of trophies, including several\nenormous gemhearts.

That tusk was probably from a whitespine. And that\neye socket, that looked frighteningly close to the structure of a santhid’s\nskull.\nOther curiosities baffled her. A vial of pale sand. A couple of thick\nhairpins. A lock of golden hair. The branch of a tree with writing on it she\ncouldn’t read. A silver knife. An odd flower preserved in some kind of\nsolution. There were no plaques to explain these mementos. That chunk of\npale pink crystal looked like it might be some kind of gemstone, but why\nwas it so delicate? Bits of it had flaked off in its case, as if simply setting it\ndown had almost crushed it.\nShe stepped, hesitantly, closer to the back of the room. Smoke from the\nfire rose, then curled and twisted around something hanging at the top of\nthe hearth. A gemstone?… No, a fabrial. It gathered the smoke as a spool\ngathered thread. She’d never seen anything like it.\n“Do you know the man named Amaram?” asked the scarred man in\nwhite.\n“No, Brightlord.”\n“I am called Mraize,” the man said. “You may use that title for me. And\nyou are?”\n“I’m called Veil,” Shallan said, using a name she’d been toying with.\n“Very well. Amaram is a Shardbearer in the court of Highprince Sadeas.\nHe is also my current prey.”\nHearing it spoken like that sent a shiver through Shallan. “And what do\nyou wish of me, Mraize?” She tried, but didn’t get the pronunciation of the\ntitle quite right. It wasn’t a Vorin term.\n“He owns a manor near Sadeas’s palace,” Mraize said. “Inside, Amaram\nhides secrets. I would know which ones. Tell your mistress to investigate\nand return to me with information next week on Chachel. She will know\nwhat I seek. If she does this, my disappointment with her will fade.”\nSneaking into the manor of a Shardbearer? Storms! Shallan had no idea\nhow she’d accomplish such a thing. She should leave this place, abandon\nher disguise, and count herself lucky for having escaped alive.\nMraize set down his empty cup of wine, and she saw that his right hand\nwas scarred, the fingers crooked, as if they had been broken and badly reset.\nThere, glistening and golden on Mraize’s middle finger, was a signet ring\nbearing the same symbol that Jasnah had drawn. The symbol Shallan’s\nsteward had carried, the symbol that Kabsal had tattooed on his body.\nThere was no backing out. Shallan would do whatever she had to in\norder to find out what these people knew. About her family, about Jasnah,\nand about the end of the world itself.\n“The task will be done,” Shallan said to Mraize.\n“No question of payment?” Mraize asked, amused, removing a dart\nfrom his pocket. “Your mistress always asked.”\n“Brightlord,” Shallan said, “one does not haggle at the finest"

Do not alert anyone or bring suspicion. Tyn is\nto investigate and return. Nothing more.”\nHe turned around and blew a dart into the wall. Shallan glanced at the\nother four people by the fire and took Memories of them with a quick blink\neach. Then—sensing she had been dismissed—she walked to the ladder.\nShe felt Mraize’s eyes on her back as he raised his blowgun one last\ntime. The trapdoor opened above. Shallan felt the gaze follow her as she\nclimbed up the ladder.\nA dart passed just beneath her, between the rungs, and stabbed the wall.\nBreathing quickly, Shallan left the hidden chamber, entering the dusty upper\nbasement again. The trapdoor closed, shutting her away into the darkness.\nHer poise broke, and she scrambled up the steps and out of the building.\nShe stopped outside, breathing deeply. The street outside had grown more\nbusy, not less, with those taverns drawing a crowd. Shallan hurried on her\nway.\nShe realized now that she hadn’t had much of a plan in coming to meet\nwith the Ghostbloods. What was she going to do? Get information from\nthem somehow? That would require earning their trust. Mraize didn’t seem\nthe type to trust anyone. How would she find out what he knew about\nUrithiru? How to call his people off her brothers? How would she—\n“Following,” Pattern said.\nShallan pulled up short. “What?”\n“People follow,” Pattern said, voice pleasant, as if he had no idea how\ntense this entire experience had been for Shallan. “You asked me to watch. I\nwatched.”\nOf course Mraize would send someone to tail her. Her cold sweat\nreturning, Shallan forced herself to move, not looking over her shoulder.\n“How many?” she asked Pattern, who had climbed up onto the side of her\ncoat.\n“One,” Pattern said. “The person with the mask, though she now wears\na black cloak. Should we go speak with her? You are friends now, right?”\n“No. I wouldn’t say that.”\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. She suspected he was trying to figure out the\nnature of human interactions. Good luck.\nWhat to do? Shallan doubted she could lose her tail. The woman would\nhave practice with this sort of thing, while Shallan… well, she had a lot of\npractice reading books and sketching pictures.\nLightweaving, she thought. Can I do something with that?

Ignoring memories of a\nsimilar alleyway in Kharbranth, Shallan turned in to this one with a quick\nstep, then immediately breathed out Stormlight, trying to shape it. Perhaps\ninto the image of a large man, to cover over her coat, and…\nAnd the Stormlight just puffed in front of her, doing nothing. She\npanicked, but forced herself to keep moving down the alleyway.\nIt didn’t work. Why didn’t it work? She’d been able to make it work in\nher rooms!\nThe only thing she could think that was different was her sketch. In her\nrooms, she’d drawn a detailed picture. She didn’t have that now.\nShe reached into her pocket, taking out the sheet of paper with the map\nsketched on it. The back was blank. She fished in the other pocket for the\npencil she’d instinctively put there and tried to draw while walking.\nImpossible. Salas had almost set, and it was too dark. Besides, she couldn’t\ndo good detail while moving and with nothing firm to back the paper. If she\nstopped and sketched, would that arouse suspicion? Storms, she was so\nnervous, she had trouble keeping the pencil straight.\nShe needed a place where she could hide, crouch down, and do a solid\nsketch. Like one of those doorway nooks she’d passed in the alleyway.\nShe started to draw a wall.\nThat she could do while walking. She turned down a side street, the\nlight from an open tavern spilling across her. She ignored the ruckus of\nlaughter and shouts, though a few of those seemed to be directed at her, and\ndrew a simple stone wall on her sheet.\nShe had no idea if this would work, but she might as well try. She\nturned in to another alleyway—almost stumbling over the snoring form of a\ndrunk who was missing his shoes—then took off at a run. A short distance\nin, she ducked into a doorway recess a couple of feet deep. Breathing out\nher remaining Stormlight, she imagined the wall she’d drawn covering over\nthe doorway.\nEverything went black.\nThe alley had been dark anyway, but now she couldn’t see anything. No\nphantom light of the moon, no glow from the torchlit tavern at the end of\nthe alley. Did that mean her image was working? She pushed back against\nthe door behind her, pulling off her hat, trying to make sure none of her\npoked through the illusory wall. She heard a faint scrape outside, boots on\nstone, and a sound like clothing brushing against the wall across from her.\nThen nothing.\nShallan remained there, frozen, straining her ears but hearing only the\nthud of her heart. Finally, she whispered, “Pattern. Are you here?”\n“Yes,” he said.\n“Go and see if the woman is outside somewhere near.”\nHe made no sound as he left and then returned. “She is gone.”\nShallan let out the breath she’d been holding. Then, bracing herself, she\nstepped through the wall. A glow, like that of Stormlight, filled her vision.\nThen she was out, standing in the alleyway.

Examined closely, the joints\nbetween her stones didn’t align perfectly with the real ones, but that was\nhard to see at night. Only a few moments later, though, the illusion\nshattered back to swirling Stormlight and evaporated. She had no Light left\nto sustain it.\n“Your disguise is gone,” Pattern noted.\nRed hair. Shallan gasped, then immediately shoved her safehand into\nher pocket. The darkeyed con woman that Tyn had trained could go about\nhalf-clothed, but not Shallan herself. It just wasn’t right.\nIt was also stupid, and she knew that, but she couldn’t change her\nfeelings. She hesitated briefly, then took off the coat. With that and the hat\nremoved, and with her hair and face changed, she was a different person.\nShe left out the opposite end of the alley from where she assumed the\nmasked woman had gone.\nShallan hesitated, getting her bearings. Where was the mansion? She\ntried retracing her route mentally, but had trouble fixing her position. She\nneeded something she could see. She took out her wrinkled paper and drew\na quick map of the path she’d taken so far.\n“I can lead you back to the mansion,” Pattern said.\n“I can manage.” Shallan held up the map and nodded.\n“Mmm. It is a pattern. You can see this one?”\n“Yes.”\n“But not the pattern of letters with the spanreed?”\nHow could she explain? “Those were words,” Shallan said. “The\nwarcamp is a place, something I can draw.” The picture of the path back\nwas clear to her.\n“Ah…” Pattern said.\nShe returned to the mansion without incident, but she couldn’t be\ncertain she’d cleanly slipped the tail, nor whether someone from Sebarial’s\nstaff had seen her crossing the grounds and climbing into the window. That\nwas the problem with sneaking about. If nothing seemed to have gone\nwrong, you rarely knew if it was because you were safe, or if someone had\nspotted you and just hadn’t done anything. Yet.\nAfter pulling her shutters closed and snapping the drapes into place,\nShallan threw herself back onto the plush bed, breathing deeply and\ntrembling.\nThat was, she thought, the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done.\nAnd yet she found herself excited, flushed with the thrill of it. Storms!\nShe’d enjoyed that. The tension, the sweat, the talking her way out of being\nkilled, even the chase at the end. What was wrong with her? When she’d\ntried to steal from Jasnah, every part of the experience had made her sick.\nI’m not that girl anymore, Shallan thought, smiling and staring at the\nceiling. I haven’t been for weeks now.\nShe would find a way to investigate this Brightlord Amaram, and she\nwould earn the trust of Mraize so she could find out what he knew. I still\nneed an alliance with the Kholin family, she thought. And the path to that is\nPrince Adolin. She’d have to find a way to interact with him again as soon\nas possible, but somehow that didn’t make her look desperate."

She’d have to find a way to interact with him again as soon\nas possible, but somehow that didn’t make her look desperate.\nThe part involving him seemed likely to be the most pleasant of her\ntasks. Still smiling, she threw herself off the bed and went to see if any food\nremained on that tray she’d been left.\n44. One Form of Justice\nBut as for the Bondsmiths, they had members\nonly three, which number was not uncommon for\nthem; nor did they seek to increase this by great\nbounds, for during the times of Madasa, only one\nof their order was in continual accompaniment of\nUrithiru and its thrones. Their spren was\nunderstood to be specific, and to persuade them to\ngrow to the magnitude of the other orders was\nseen as seditious.\nFrom Words of Radiance, chapter 16, page\n14\nKaladin never felt more uncomfortably conspicuous than when visiting\nDalinar’s lighteyed training grounds, where all of the other soldiers were\nhighborn.\nDalinar mandated that his soldiers wear uniforms during duty hours, and\nthese men obeyed. In his own blue uniform, Kaladin shouldn’t have felt set\noff from them, but he did. Theirs were more lavish, with bright buttons up\nthe sides of the fine coats and gemstones set into the buttons. Others\nornamented their uniforms with embroidery. Colorful scarves were growing\npopular.\nThe lighteyed looked over Kaladin and his men as they entered. As\nmuch as the regular soldiers treated his men like heroes—as much as even\nthese officers respected Dalinar and his decisions—their postures were\nhostile toward him and his.\nYou are not wanted here, those stares said. Everyone has a place. You’re\nout of yours. Like a chull in a dining hall.\n“May I be relieved from duty for today’s training, sir?” Renarin asked\nKaladin. The youth wore a Bridge Four uniform.\nKaladin nodded. His departure made the other bridgemen relax. Kaladin\npointed toward three watch positions, and three of his men ran off to stand\nguard. Moash, Teft, and Yake stayed with him.\nKaladin marched them up to Zahel, who stood at the back of the sand-\ncovered courtyard. Though the other ardents all busied themselves carrying\nwater, towels, or sparring weapons to dueling lighteyes, Zahel had drawn a\ncircle in the sand and was throwing little colored rocks into it.\n“I’m taking you up on your offer,” Kaladin said, stepping up to him. “I\nbrought three of my men to learn with me.”\n“Didn’t offer to train four of you,” Zahel said.\n“I know.”\nZahel grunted. “Do forty laps around the outside of this building at a\njog, then report back. You have until I get tired of my game to return.”\nKaladin gestured sharply, and all four of them took off at a run.\n“Wait,” Zahel called.\nKaladin stopped, boots crunching sand.\n“I was just testing how willing you were to obey me,” Zahel said,\nthrowing a rock into his circle. He grunted, as if pleased with himself.\nFinally, he turned to look at them. “I suppose I don’t need to toughen you"

But boy, you’ve got red on your ears like I’ve never seen.”\n“I— Red on my ears?” Kaladin asked.\n“Damnation language. I mean that you feel you’ve got something to\nprove, that you are spoiling for a fight. It means you’re angry at everything\nand everyone.”\n“Can you blame us?” Moash asked.\n“I suppose I can’t. But if I’m going to train you lads, I can’t have your\nred ears getting in the way. You’re going to listen, and you’re going to do\nwhat I say.”\n“Yes, Master Zahel,” Kaladin said.\n“Don’t call me master,” Zahel said. He thumbed over his shoulder\ntoward Renarin, who was putting on his Shardplate with the assistance of\nsome ardents. “I’m his master. For you lads, I’m just an interested party\nwho wants to help you keep my friends alive. Wait here until I get back.”\nHe turned to walk toward Renarin. As Yake picked up one of the\ncolored stones Zahel had been throwing, the man said, without looking,\n“And don’t touch my rocks!”\nYake jumped and dropped the stone.\nKaladin settled back, leaning against one of the pillars that held up the\nroof overhang, watching Zahel give instruction to Renarin. Syl zipped down\nand began inspecting the little rocks with a curious expression, trying to\nfigure out what was special about them.\nA short time later, Zahel walked past with Renarin, explaining the lad’s\ntraining for today. Apparently, he wanted Renarin to eat lunch. Kaladin\nsmiled as some ardents hurriedly carried out a table, dining ware, and a\nheavy stool that could support a Shardbearer. They even had a tablecloth.\nZahel left the bemused Renarin, who sat in his hulking Shardplate with his\nfaceplate up, regarding a full lunch. He awkwardly picked up a fork.\n“You’re teaching him to be delicate with his newfound strength,”\nKaladin said to Zahel as the man passed back the other way.\n“Shardplate is powerful stuff,” Zahel said, not looking at Kaladin.\n“Controlling it is about more than punching through walls and jumping off\nbuildings.”\n“So when do we—”\n“Keep waiting.” Zahel wandered off.\nKaladin glanced at Teft, who shrugged. “I like him.”\nYake chuckled. “That’s because he’s almost as grouchy as you are,\nTeft.”\n“I ain’t grouchy,” Teft snapped. “I just have a low threshold for\nstupidity.”\nThey waited until Zahel jogged back toward them. The men grew\nimmediately alert, eyes widening. Zahel carried a Shardblade.\nThey’d been hoping for it. Kaladin had told them they might be able to\nhold one as part of this training. Their eyes followed that Blade as they’d\nfollow a gorgeous woman taking off her glove.\nZahel stepped up, then slammed the Blade into the sandy ground in\nfront of them. He took his hand off the hilt and waved. “All right. Try it\nout.”"

Try it\nout.”\nThey stared at it. “Kelek’s breath,” Teft finally said. “You are serious,\naren’t you?”\nNearby, Syl had turned from the rocks and stared at the Blade.\n“The morning after talking to your captain in the middle of the\nDamnation night,” Zahel said, “I went to Brightlord Dalinar and the king\nand asked permission to train you in sword stances. You don’t have to carry\nswords around or anything, but if you’re going to fight an assassin with a\nShardblade, you need to know the stances and how to respond to them.”\nHe looked down, resting his hand on the Shardblade. “Brightlord\nDalinar suggested letting you handle one of the king’s Shardblades. Smart\nman.”\nZahel removed his hand and gestured. Teft reached out to touch the\nShardblade, but Moash seized the thing first, taking it by the hilt and\nyanking it—too hard—out of the ground. He stumbled backward, and Teft\nbacked away.\n“Be careful, now!” Teft barked. “You’ll cut off your own storming arm\nif you act like a fool.”\n“I’m no fool,” Moash said, holding the sword up, pointing it outward. A\nsingle gloryspren faded into existence near his head. “It’s heavier than I\nexpected.”\n“Really?” Yake said. “Everyone says they’re light!”\n“Those are people used to a regular sword,” Zahel said. “If you’ve\ntrained all of your life with a longsword, then pick up something that looks\nlike it has two or three times as much steel to it, you expect it to weigh\nmore. Not less.”\nMoash grunted, delicately swiping with the weapon. “From the way the\nstories are told, I thought it wouldn’t have any weight at all. Like it would\nbe as light as a breeze.” He hesitantly stuck it into the ground. “It has more\nresistance when it cuts than I thought too.”\n“Guess it’s about expectations again,” Teft said, scratching at his beard\nand waving Yake to have the weapon next. The stout man pulled it free\nmore carefully than Moash had.\n“Stormfather, but it feels strange to hold this,” Yake said.\n“It’s just a tool,” Zahel said. “A valuable one, but still just a tool.\nRemember that.”\n“It’s more than a tool,” Yake said, swiping it. “I’m sorry, but it just is. I\nmight believe that about a regular sword, but this… this is art.”\nZahel shook his head in annoyance.\n“What?” Kaladin asked as Yake reluctantly handed the Shardblade over\nto Teft.\n“Men prohibited from using the sword because they’re too lowborn,”\nZahel said. “Even after all these years, it strikes me as silly. There’s nothing\nholy about swords. They’re better in some situations, worse in others.”\n“You’re an ardent,” Kaladin said. “Aren’t you supposed to uphold Vorin\narts and traditions?”"

They’re better in some situations, worse in others.”\n“You’re an ardent,” Kaladin said. “Aren’t you supposed to uphold Vorin\narts and traditions?”\n“Well,” Zahel said, “if you haven’t noticed, I’m not a very good ardent.\nI just happen to be an excellent swordsman.” He nodded toward the sword.\n“You going to take a turn?”\nSyl looked at Kaladin sharply.\n“I’ll pass unless you demand it,” Kaladin said to Zahel.\n“Not curious at all how it feels?”\n“Those things have killed too many of my friends. I’d rather not have to\ntouch it, if it’s all the same to you.”\n“Suit yourself,” Zahel said. “Brightlord Dalinar’s suggestion was to get\nyou used to these weapons. To take away some of the awe. Half the time a\nman dies by one of those, it’s because he’s too busy staring to dodge.”\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said softly. “I’ve seen that. Swing it at me. I need\npractice facing one down.”\n“Sure. Let me get the sword’s guard.”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “No guard, Zahel. I need to be afraid.”\nZahel studied Kaladin for a moment, then nodded, walking over to take\nthe sword from Moash—who had begun a second turn swinging it.\nSyl zipped past, twisting around the heads of the men, who couldn’t see\nher. “Thank you,” she said, settling onto Kaladin’s shoulder.\nZahel walked back and fell into a stance. Kaladin recognized it as one\nof the lighteyed dueling stances, but he didn’t know which one. Zahel\nstepped forward and swung.\nPanic.\nKaladin couldn’t keep it from rising. In an instant, he saw Dallet die—\nthe Shardblade shearing through his head. He saw faces with burned-out\neyes reflecting on the Blade’s too-silvery surface.\nThe Blade passed a few inches in front of him. Zahel stepped into the\nswing and brought the Blade around again in a flowing maneuver. This time\nit would hit, so Kaladin had to step back.\nStorms, those monsters were beautiful.\nZahel swung again, and Kaladin had to jump to the side to dodge. A bit\noverzealous there, Zahel, he thought. He dodged again, then reacted to a\nshadow he’d seen from the corner of his eye. He spun, and came face-to-\nface with Adolin Kholin.\nThey stared one another in the eyes. Kaladin waited for a wisecrack.\nAdolin’s eyes flicked toward Zahel and the Shardblade, then turned back to\nKaladin. Finally, the prince gave a shallow nod. He turned about and\nwalked toward Renarin.\nThe implication was simple. The Assassin in White had bested both of\nthem. There was nothing to mock in preparing to fight him again.\nDoesn’t mean he’s not a spoiled blusterer, Kaladin thought, turning back\nto Zahel. The man had waved over a fellow ardent, and was delivering the\nShardblade to him.\n“I have to go train Prince Renarin,” Zahel said. “Can’t leave him alone\nall day for you fools.

Ivis here will go through some sparring moves with\nyou and let you each face down a Shardblade, as Kaladin has done. Get\ncomfortable with the sight, so you don’t freeze when one comes for you.”\nKaladin and the others nodded. Only after Zahel had trotted away did\nKaladin notice that the new ardent, Ivis, was a woman. Though she was an\nardent, she kept her hand gloved, so there was some acknowledgment of her\ngender, even if the flowing ardent clothing and shaved head masked some\nof the other obvious signs.\nA woman with a sword. An odd sight. Of course, was it any odder than\ndarkeyed men holding a Shardblade?\nIvis gave them lengths of wood that, weight and balance wise, were\ndecent approximations of a Shardblade. Like a child’s scribble with chalk\ncould be a decent approximation of a person. Then she put them through\nseveral routines, demonstrating the ten Shardblade sword stances.\nKaladin had been looking to kill lighteyes from the moment he’d first\ntouched a spear, and during the later years—before being enslaved—he’d\ngotten pretty good at it. But those lighteyes he’d hunted on the battlefield\nhadn’t been terribly skilled. The majority of men who were truly good with\na sword had made their way to the Shattered Plains. So the stances were\nnew to him.\nHe started to see and understand. Knowing the stances would let him\nanticipate a swordsman’s next move. He didn’t have to be wielding a sword\nhimself—he still thought it an inflexible weapon—to make use of that.\nAn hour or so later, Kaladin set down his practice sword and stepped\nover to the water barrel. No ardents or parshmen ran drinks to him or his\nmen. He was just fine with that; he wasn’t some pampered rich boy. He\nleaned against the barrel, taking a ladle of water, feeling the good\nexhaustion deep in his muscles that told him he’d been doing something\nworthwhile.\nHe scanned the grounds for Adolin and Renarin. He wasn’t on duty\nwatching either of them—Adolin would have come with Mart and Eth, and\nRenarin was under the watch of the three that Kaladin had assigned earlier.\nStill, he couldn’t help looking to see how they were. An accident here could\nbe—\nA woman was on the practice grounds. Not an ardent, but a true\nlighteyed woman, the one with the vibrant red hair. She had just wandered\nin, and was scanning the grounds.\nHe didn’t bear a grudge about the incident with his boots. It simply\ntypified how, to a lighteyes, men like Kaladin were playthings. You toyed\nwith darkeyes, took what you needed from them, and gave no thought to\nhaving left them far worse for the interaction.\nIt was how Roshone had been. It was how Sadeas was. It was how this\nwoman was. She wasn’t evil, really. She just didn’t care.\nShe’s probably a good match for the princeling, he thought as Yake and\nTeft jogged over for some water.

She didn’t call for Kaladin. He seemed to intimidate many of the\nardents.\nYake jogged back, but Teft lingered for a moment, then nodded toward\nthe girl, Shallan. “You think we have to worry about her? Foreign woman\nabout whom we know very little, sent in to suddenly be Adolin’s betrothed.\nSure would make a good assassin.”\n“Damnation,” Kaladin said. “I should have seen that. Good eye, Teft.”\nTeft shrugged modestly, then jogged back to his training.\nHe’d assumed the woman was an opportunist, but could she actually be\nan assassin? Kaladin picked up his practice sword and wandered toward\nher, passing Renarin, who was training in some of the same stances that\nKaladin’s men were practicing.\nAs Kaladin walked toward Shallan, Adolin clanked up beside him in\nShardplate.\n“What is she doing here?” Kaladin asked.\n“Come to watch me while I spar, presumably,” Adolin said. “I usually\nhave to kick them out.”\n“Them?”\n“You know. Girls who want to gawk at me while I fight. I wouldn’t\nmind, but if we allowed it, they’d clog the entire grounds every time I came.\nNobody would be able to get any sparring done.”\nKaladin raised an eyebrow at him.\n“What?” Adolin asked. “You don’t get women coming to watch while\nyou spar, bridgeboy? Little darkeyed ladies, missing seven teeth and afraid\nof bathing…”\nKaladin looked away from Adolin, drawing his lips to a line. Next time,\nhe thought, I let the assassin have this one.\nAdolin chuckled for a moment, though his laughter trailed off\nawkwardly. “Anyway,” he continued, “she probably has a better reason to\nbe here than others, considering our relationship. We’ll still have to kick her\nout. Can’t set a bad precedent.”\n“You really let this happen?” Kaladin asked. “A betrothal to a woman\nyou’d never met?”\nAdolin shrugged armored shoulders. “Things always go so well at first,\nand then… they fall apart on me.

Her eyes were on Nall, head ardent of the\npractice grounds. Shallan bowed to her in reverence.\nAdolin scowled, turning to jog after Shallan, passing Kaladin, who\nsmirked at him.\n“Come to watch you, I see,” Kaladin said. “Completely fascinated by\nyou, obviously.”\n“Shut up,” Adolin growled.\nKaladin strolled after Adolin, reaching Shallan and Nall in the middle of\na conversation.\n“… visual records of these suits are pathetic, Sister Nall,” Shallan was\nsaying, handing Nall a bound leather portfolio. “We need new sketches.\nThough much of my time will be spent clerking for Brightlord Sebarial, I\nwould like a few projects of my own during my time at the Shattered Plains.\nWith your blessing, I wish to proceed.”\n“Your talent is admirable,” Nall said, flipping through pages. “Art is\nyour Calling?”\n“Natural History, Sister Nall, though sketching is a priority for me in\nthat line of study as well.”\n“As well it should be.” The ardent turned another page. “You have my\nblessing, dear child. Tell me, which devotary do you call your own?”\n“That is… a subject of some consternation on my part,” Shallan said,\ntaking the portfolio back. “Oh! Adolin. I didn’t notice you there. My, but\nyou do loom when you wear that armor, don’t you?”\n“You’re letting her stay?” Adolin asked Nall.\n“She wishes to update the royal record of Shardplate and Shardblades in\nthe warcamps with new sketches,” Nall said. “This seems wise. The king’s\ncurrent accounting of the Shards includes many rough sketches, but few\ndetailed drawings.”\n“So you’re going to need me to pose for you?” Adolin asked, turning to\nShallan.\n“Actually, the sketches of your Plate are quite complete,” Shallan said,\n“thanks to your mother. I’ll focus first on the King’s Plate and Blades,\nwhich nobody has thought to sketch in any detail.”\n“Just stay out of the way of the men sparring, child,” Nall said as\nsomeone called for her. She walked off.\n“Look,” Adolin said, turning to Shallan. “I can see what you’re up to.”\n“Five foot six inches,” Shallan said. “I suspect that’s all I will ever be\nup to, unfortunately.”\n“Five foot…” Adolin said, frowning.\n“Yes,” Shallan said, scanning the practice grounds. “I thought it was a\ngood height, then I came here. You Alethi really are freakishly tall, aren’t\nyou? I’d guess everyone here is a good two inches taller than the Veden\naverage.”\n“No, that’s not…” Adolin frowned. “You’re here because you want to"

Your boots are on the way to your barracks via\ncourier.”\nKaladin started as he realized she was talking to him. “Is that so?”\n“I had the soles replaced,” Shallan said. “They were terribly\nuncomfortable.”\n“I liked how they fit!”\n“Then you must have stones for feet.” She glanced down, then cocked\nan eyebrow.\n“Wait,” Adolin said, frowning more deeply. “You wore the bridgeboy’s\nboots? How did that happen?”\n“Awkwardly,” Shallan replied. “And with three pairs of socks.” She\npatted Adolin’s armored arm. “If you really want me to sketch you, Adolin,\nI will. No need to act jealous, though I do still want that walk you promised\nme. Oh! I need to get that. Excuse me.”\nShe strode toward where Renarin was taking hits on his armor from\nZahel, presumably to get him used to taking a beating while wearing Plate.\nShallan’s green gown and red hair were vibrant slashes of color on the\ngrounds. Kaladin inspected her, wondering just how far she could be\ntrusted. Probably not far.\n“Insufferable woman,” Adolin growled. He glanced at Kaladin. “Stop\nleering at her backside, bridgeboy.”\n“I’m not leering. And what do you care? You just said she was\ninsufferable.”\n“Yeah,” Adolin said, looking back toward her with a wide grin. “She all\nbut ignored me, didn’t she?”\n“I suppose.”\n“Insufferable,” Adolin said, though he seemed to mean something\ncompletely different. His smile widened and he strode after her, moving\nwith the grace of Shardplate that was so discordant with its apparent bulk.\nKaladin shook his head. Lighteyes and their games. How had he found\nhimself in such a position that he had to spend so much time around them?\nHe walked back to the barrel and got another drink. Soon after, a practice\nsword crunching to the sand announced Moash joining him.\nMoash nodded gratefully as Kaladin handed over the ladle. Teft and\nYake were having a turn facing down the Shardblade.\n“She let you go?” Kaladin asked, nodding toward their trainer.\nMoash shrugged, gulping water. “I didn’t flinch.”\nKaladin nodded appreciatively.\n“What we’re doing here is good,” Moash said. “Important. After the\nway you trained us in those chasms, I thought I didn’t have anything left to\nlearn. Shows how much I knew.”\nKaladin nodded, folding his arms. Adolin displayed several dueling\nstances for Renarin, Zahel nodding approvingly. Shallan had settled down\nto sketch them. Was this all an excuse to get her close, so she could wait for\nthe right time to slide a knife into Adolin’s gut?"

So he kept an\neye on Adolin as the man turned and began sparring with Zahel, to give\nRenarin some perspective on how to use the stances.\nAdolin was a good swordsman. Kaladin would give him that much. So\nwas Zahel, for that matter.\n“It was the king,” Moash said. “He had my family executed.”\nIt took Kaladin a moment to realize what Moash was talking about. The\nperson that Moash wanted to kill, the person he had a grudge against. It was\nthe king.\nKaladin felt a shock spike through him, as if he’d been punched. He\nturned on Moash.\n“We’re Bridge Four,” Moash continued, staring off to the side at\nnothing in particular. He took another drink. “We stick together. You should\nknow about… why I am the way I am. My grandparents were the only\nfamily I ever knew. Parents died when I was a child. Ana and Da, they\nraised me. The king… he killed them.”\n“How did it happen?” Kaladin asked softly, checking to make sure none\nof the ardents were close enough to hear.\n“I was away,” Moash said, “working a caravan that ran out here, to this\nwasteland. Ana and Da, they were second nahn. Important for darkeyes, you\nknow? Ran their own shop. Silversmiths. I never picked up on the trade.\nLiked to be out walking. Going somewhere.\n“Well, a lighteyed man owned two or three silversmith shops in\nKholinar, one of which was across from my grandparents. He never did like\nthe competition. This was a year or so before the old king died, and Elhokar\nwas left in charge of the kingdom while Gavilar was out at the Plains.\nAnyway, Elhokar was good friends with the lighteyes who was in\ncompetition with my grandparents.\n“So, he did his friend a favor. Elhokar had Ana and Da dragged in on\nsome charge or another. They were important enough to demand a right to\ntrial, an inquest before magistrates. I think it surprised Elhokar that he\ncouldn’t completely ignore the law. He pled lack of time and sent Ana and\nDa to the dungeons to wait until an inquest could be arranged.” Moash\ndipped the ladle back into the barrel. “They died there a few months later,\nstill waiting for Elhokar to approve their paperwork.”\n“That’s not exactly the same as killing them.”\nMoash met Kaladin’s eyes. “You doubt that sending a seventy-five-\nyear-old couple to the palace dungeons is a death sentence?”\n“I guess… well, I guess you’re right.”\nMoash nodded sharply, tossing the ladle into the barrel. “Elhokar knew\nthey’d die in there. That way, the hearing would never go before the\nmagistrates, exposing his corruption. That bastard killed them—murdered\nthem to keep his secret. I came home from my trip with the caravan to an\nempty house, and the neighbors told me my family was already two months\ndead.”"

Nobody was close enough to hear, not over\nthe sounds of weapons and shouting common to sparring grounds. Still, the\nwords seemed to hang in front of him, as loud as a trumpeter’s call.\nMoash froze, looking him in the eye.\n“That night on the balcony,” Kaladin said, “did you make it look like a\nShardblade cut the railing?”\nMoash took him by the arm in a tight grip, looking about. “We\nshouldn’t talk about this here.”\n“Stormfather, Moash!” Kaladin said, the depth of it sinking in. “We’ve\nbeen hired to protect the man!”\n“Our job,” Moash said, “is to keep Dalinar alive. I can agree with that.\nHe doesn’t seem too bad, for a lighteyes. Storms, this kingdom would be a\nlot better off if he were king instead. Don’t tell me you think differently.”\n“But killing the king—”\n“Not here,” Moash hissed through clenched teeth.\n“I can’t just let it go. Nalan’s hand! I’m going to have to tell—”\n“You’d do that?” Moash demanded. “You’d turn on a member of Bridge\nFour?”\nThey locked gazes.\nKaladin turned away. “Damnation. No, I won’t. At least, not if you’ll\nagree to stop. You may have a grudge with the king, but you can’t just try\nto… you know…”\n“And what else am I supposed to do?” Moash asked softly. By now,\nhe’d pulled right up to Kaladin. “What kind of justice can a man like me get\non a king, Kaladin? Tell me.”\nThis can’t be happening.\n“I’ll stop for now,” Moash said. “If you’ll agree to meet with someone.”\n“Who?” Kaladin asked, looking back to him.\n“This plan wasn’t my idea. Some others are involved. All I had to do\nwas throw them a rope. I want you to listen to them.”\n“Moash…”\n“Listen to what they have to say,” Moash said, grip tightening on\nKaladin’s arm. “Just listen, Kal. That’s all. If you don’t agree with what\nthey tell you, I’ll back out. Please.”\n“You promise not to do anything else against the king until we’ve had\nthis meeting?”\n“On my grandparents’ honor.”\nKaladin sighed, but nodded. “All right.”\nMoash relaxed visibly. He nodded, scooping up his mock sword, then\nran back to do some more practice with the Shardblade. Kaladin sighed,\nturning to grab his sword, and came face-to-face with Syl hovering behind\nhim. Her tiny eyes had gone wide, hands as fists to her sides.\n“What did you just do?” she demanded. “I only heard the last part.”\n“Moash was involved,” Kaladin whispered. “I need to follow this\nthrough, Syl. If someone is trying to kill the king, it’s my job to investigate\nthem.”"

If someone is trying to kill the king, it’s my job to investigate\nthem.”\n“Oh.” She frowned. “I felt something. Something else.” She shook her\nhead. “Kaladin, this is dangerous. We should go to Dalinar.”\n“I promised Moash,” he said, kneeling and untying his boots and\nremoving his socks. “I can’t go to Dalinar until I know more.”\nSyl followed him as a ribbon of light as he took the fake Shardblade and\nwalked out into the sands of the dueling grounds. The sand was cold under\nhis bare feet. He wanted to feel it.\nHe fell into Windstance and practiced a few of the swings that Ivis had\ntaught them. Nearby, a group of lighteyed men nudged one another,\nnodding toward him. One said something soft, making the others laugh,\nthough several others continued frowning. The image of a darkeyed man\nwith even a practice Shardblade was not something they found amusing.\nThis is my right, Kaladin thought, swinging, ignoring them. I defeated a\nShardbearer. I belong here.\nWhy weren’t darkeyes encouraged to practice like this? The darkeyed\nmen in history who had won Shardblades were praised in song and story.\nEvod Markmaker, Lanacin, Raninor of the Fields… These men were\nrevered. But modern darkeyes, well, they were told not to think beyond\ntheir station. Or else.\nBut what was the purpose of the Vorin church? Of ardents and Callings\nand the arts? Improve yourself. Be better. Why shouldn’t men like him be\nexpected to dream big dreams? None of it seemed to fit. Society and\nreligion, they just flat-out contradicted each other.\nSoldiers are glorified in the Tranquiline Halls. But without farmers,\nsoldiers can’t eat—so being a farmer is probably all right too.\nBetter yourself with a Calling in life. But don’t get too ambitious or\nwe’ll lock you away.\nDon’t get revenge upon the king for ordering the death of your\ngrandparents. But do get revenge on the Parshendi for ordering the death of\nsomeone you never met.\nKaladin stopped swinging, sweating but feeling unfulfilled. When he\nfought or trained, it wasn’t supposed to be like this. It was supposed to be\nKaladin and the weapon, as one, not all of these problems bouncing around\nin his head.\n“Syl,” he said, trying a thrust with the sword, “you’re honorspren. Does\nthat mean you can tell me the right thing to do?”\n“Definitely,” she said, hanging nearby in the form of a young woman,\nlegs swinging off an invisible ledge. She wasn’t zipping around him in a\nribbon, as she often did when he sparred.\n“Is it wrong for Moash to try to kill the king?”\n“Of course.”\n“Why?”\n“Because killing is wrong.”\n“And the Parshendi I killed?”\n“We’ve talked about this. It had to be done.”\n“And what if one of them was a Surgebinder,” Kaladin said. “With his\nown honorspren?”\n“Parshendi can’t become Surgebin—”"

He\nwasn’t getting it right. “I’d guess all the Parshendi want to do at this point is\nsurvive. Storms, the ones involved in Gavilar’s death, they might not even\nstill be alive. Their leaders were executed back in Alethkar, after all. So you\ntell me, if a common Parshendi who is protecting his people comes up\nagainst me, what would his honorspren say? That he’s doing the right\nthing?”\n“I…” Syl hunched down. She hated questions like this. “It doesn’t\nmatter. You said you won’t kill the Parshendi anymore.”\n“And Amaram? Can I kill him?”\n“Is that justice?” Syl asked.\n“One form.”\n“There’s a difference.”\n“What?” Kaladin demanded, thrusting. Storm it! Why couldn’t he make\nthe stupid weapon go where it should?\n“Because of what it does to you,” Syl said softly. “Thinking about him\nchanges you. Twists you. You’re supposed to protect, Kaladin. Not kill.”\n“You have to kill to protect,” he snapped. “Storms. You’re starting to\nsound as bad as my father.”\nHe tried a few more stances, until finally Ivis came over and gave him\nsome corrections. She laughed at his frustration as he held the sword wrong\nagain. “You expected to pick this up in one day?”\nHe kind of had. He knew the spear; he’d trained long and hard. He\nthought that maybe, this would all just click.\nIt didn’t. He kept on anyway, going through the motions, kicking up\ncold sand, mixing among the lighteyes sparring and practicing their own\nforms. Eventually, Zahel wandered by.\n“Keep at it,” the man said without even inspecting Kaladin’s forms.\n“I was under the impression you’d be training me personally,” Kaladin\ncalled after him.\n“Too much work,” Zahel called back, digging a canteen of something\nfrom a bundle of cloth beside one of the pillars. Another ardent had piled\nhis colored rocks there, which made Zahel scowl.\nKaladin jogged up to him. “I saw Dalinar Kholin, while unarmed and\nunarmored, catch a Shardblade in midair with the flats of his palms.”\nZahel grunted. “Old Dalinar pulled off a lastclap, eh? Good for him.”\n“Can you teach me?”\n“It’s a stupid maneuver,” Zahel said. “When it works, it’s only because\nmost Shardbearers learn to swing their weapons without as much force as\nthey would a regular blade. And it doesn’t usually work; it usually fails, and\nyou’re dead when it does. Better to focus your time practicing things that\nwill actively help you.”\nKaladin nodded.\n“Not going to push me on it?” Zahel asked.\n“Your argument is good,” Kaladin said. “Solid soldier’s logic. Makes\nsense.”\n“Huh. Might be hope for you after all.” Zahel took a swig from his\ncanteen. “Now go get back to practicing.”"

Middlefest\nTHREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO\nShallan poked at the cage, and the colorful creature inside shifted on its\nperch, cocking its head at her.\nIt was the most bizarre thing she’d ever seen. It stood on two feet like a\nperson, though its feet were clawed. It was only about as tall as two fists\natop one another, but the way it turned its head as it looked at her showed\nunmistakable personality.\nThe thing only had a little bit of shell—on the nose and mouth—but the\nstrangest part was its hair. It had bright green hair that covered its entire\nbody. The hair lay flat, as if manicured. As she watched, the creature turned\nand began to pick at the hair—a large flap of it lifted up, and she could see\nit grew out of a central spine.\n“What does the young lady think of my chicken?” the merchant said\nproudly, standing with hands clasped behind his back, ample stomach thrust\nforward like the prow of a ship. Behind, people moved through the fair in a\nthrong. There were so many. Five hundred, perhaps even more, people in\nthe same place.\n“Chicken,” Shallan said, poking at the cage with a timid finger. “I’ve\neaten chicken before.”\n“Not this breed!” the Thaylen man said with a laugh. “Chickens for\neating are stupid—this one is smart, almost as smart as a man! It can speak.\nListen. Jeksonofnone! Say your name!”\n“Jeksonofnone,” the creature said.\nShallan jumped back. The word was mangled by the creature’s inhuman\nvoice, but it was recognizable. “A Voidbringer!” she hissed, safehand to her\nchest. “An animal that speaks! You’ll bring the eyes of the Unmade upon\nus.”\nThe merchant laughed. “These things live all over Shinovar, young lady.\nIf their speech drew the Unmade, the entire country would be cursed!”\n“Shallan!” Father stood with his bodyguards where he had been\nspeaking to another merchant across the way. She hurried toward him,\nlooking over her shoulder at the strange animal. Deviant though the thing\nwas, if it could talk, she felt sorry for its being trapped in that cage.\nThe Middlefest Fair was a highlight of the year. Set during the midpeace\n—a period opposite the Weeping when there were no storms—it drew\npeople from hamlets and villages all around. Many of the people here were\nfrom lands her father oversaw, including lesser lighteyes from families who\nhad ruled the same villages for centuries.\nThe darkeyes came too, of course, including merchants—citizens of the\nfirst and second nahns. Her father didn’t speak of it often, but she knew he\nfound their wealth and station inappropriate. The Almighty had chosen the\nlighteyes to rule, not these merchants.\n“Come along,” Father said to her.\nShallan followed him and his bodyguards through the busy fair, which\nwas laid out on her father’s estates about a half day’s travel from the"

        "text": "“Come along,” Father said to her.\nShallan followed him and his bodyguards through the busy fair, which\nwas laid out on her father’s estates about a half day’s travel from the\nmansion. The basin was fairly well sheltered, the slopes nearby covered in\njella trees. Their strong branches grew spindly leaves—long spikes of pink,\nyellow, and orange, and so the trees looked like explosions of color. Shallan\nhad read in one of her father’s books that the trees drew in crem, then used\nit to make their wood hard, like rock.\nIn the basin itself, most of the trees had been broken down, though some\nwere instead used to hold up canopies dozens of yards wide, tied in place\nhigh above. They passed a merchant cursing as a windspren darted through\nhis enclosure, making objects stick together. Shallan smiled, pulling her\nsatchel out from under her arm. There wasn’t time to sketch, however, as\nher father barreled on toward the dueling grounds where—if this was like\nprevious years—she would spend most of the fair.\n“Shallan,” he said, causing her to scurry to catch up. At fourteen, she\nfelt horribly gangly and far too boyish in figure. As womanhood had begun\nto come upon her, she had learned that she should be embarrassed by her\nred hair and freckled skin, as they were a mark of an impure heritage. They\nwere traditional Veden colorings, but that was because—in their past—their\nlines had mixed with the Horneaters up in the peaks.\nSome people were proud of the coloring. Not her father, so neither was\nShallan.\n“You are coming to an age where you must act more like a lady,” Father\nsaid. The darkeyes gave them plenty of room, bowing as her father passed.\nTwo of Father’s ardents trailed after them, hands behind their backs,\ncontemplative. “You will need to stop gawking so often. It will not be long\nbefore we will want to find a husband for you.”\n“Yes, Father,” she said.\n“I may need to stop bringing you to events like these,” he said. “All you\ndo is run around and act like a child. You need a new tutor, at the very\nleast.”\nHe’d scared off the last tutor. The woman had been an expert in\nlanguages, and Shallan had been picking up Azish quite well—but she’d\nleft soon after one of Father’s… episodes. Shallan’s stepmother had\nappeared the next day with bruises on her face. Brightness Hasheh, the\ntutor, had packed her things and fled without giving notice.\nShallan nodded to her father’s words, but secretly hoped that she’d be\nable to sneak away and find her brothers. Today she had work to do. She\nand her father approached the “dueling arena,” which was a grandiose term\nfor a section of roped-off ground where parshmen had dumped half a\nbeach’s worth of sand. Canopied tables had been erected for the lighteyes to\nsit at, dine, and converse.\nShallan’s stepmother, Malise, was a young woman less than ten years\nolder than Shallan herself. Short of stature with buttonlike features, she sat\nstraight-backed, her black hair brightened by a few streaks of blond. Father"

Father\nsettled in beside her in their box; he was one of four men of his rank, fourth\ndahn, who would be attending the fair. The duelists would be the lesser\nlighteyes from the surrounding region. Many of them would be landless,\nand duels would be one of their only ways to gain notoriety.\nShallan sat in the seat reserved for her, and a servant handed her chilled\nwater in a glass. She had barely taken a single sip before someone\napproached the box.\nBrightlord Revilar might have been handsome, if his nose hadn’t been\nremoved in a youthful duel. He wore a wooden replacement, painted black\n—a strange mixture of covering up the blemish and drawing attention to it\nat the same time. Silver-haired, well-dressed in a suit of a modern design,\nhe had the distracted look of someone who had left his hearth burning\nuntended back at home. His lands bordered Father’s; they were two of the\nten men of similar rank who served under the highprince.\nRevilar approached with not one, but two master-servants at his side.\nTheir black-and-white uniforms were a distinction that ordinary servants\nwere denied, and Father eyed them hungrily. He’d tried to hire master-\nservants. Each had cited his “reputation” and had refused.\n“Brightlord Davar,” Revilar said. He did not wait for permission before\nclimbing up the steps into the box. Father and he were the same rank, but\neveryone knew the allegations against Father—and that the highprince saw\nthem as credible.\n“Revilar,” Father said, eyes forward.\n“May I sit?” He took a seat beside Father—the one that Helaran, as heir,\nwould have used if he’d been there. Revilar’s two servants took up places\nbehind him. They somehow managed to convey a sense of disapproval of\nFather without saying anything.\n“Is your son going to duel today?” Father asked.\n“Actually, yes.”\n“Hopefully he can keep all of his parts. We wouldn’t want your\nexperience to become a tradition.”\n“Now, now, Lin,” Revilar said. “That is no way to speak to a business\nassociate.”\n“Business associate? We have dealings of which I am not aware?”\nOne of Revilar’s servants, the woman, set a small sheaf of pages on the\ntable before Father. Shallan’s stepmother took them hesitantly, then began\nto read them out loud. The terms were for an exchange of goods, Father\ntrading some of his breechtree cotton and raw shum to Revilar in exchange\nfor a small payment. Revilar would then take the goods to market for sale.\nFather stopped the reading three-quarters of the way through. “Are you\ndelusional? One clearmark a bag? A tenth of what that shum is worth!\nConsidering patrols of roadways and maintenance fees paid back to the\nvillages where the materials are harvested, I would lose spheres on this\ndeal.”\n“Oh, it is not so bad,” Revilar said. “I think you will find the\narrangement quite agreeable.”\n“You’re insane.”\n“I’m popular.”\nFather frowned, growing red-faced.

        "text": "arrangement quite agreeable.”\n“You’re insane.”\n“I’m popular.”\nFather frowned, growing red-faced. Shallan could remember a time\nwhen she’d rarely, if ever, seen him angry. Those days were long, long\ndead. “Popular?” Father demanded. “What does—”\n“You may or may not know,” Revilar said, “that the highprince himself\nrecently visited my estates. It seems he likes what I have been doing for this\nprincedom’s textiles. That, added to my son’s dueling prowess, has drawn\nattention to my house. I have been invited to visit the highprince in Vedenar\none week out of ten, starting next month.”\nAt times, Father was not the cleverest of men, but he did have a mind\nfor politics. So Shallan thought, at least, though she did so want to believe\nthe best about him. Either way, he saw this implication immediately.\n“You rat,” Father whispered.\n“You have very few options open to you, Lin,” Revilar said, leaning\ntoward him. “Your house is on the decline, your reputation in shambles.\nYou need allies. I need to look the part of a financial genius to the\nhighprince. We can assist one another.”\nFather bowed his head. Outside the box, the first duelists were\nannounced, an inconsequential bout.\n“Everywhere I step, I find only corners,” Father whispered. “Slowly,\nthey trap me.”\nRevilar pushed the papers toward Shallan’s stepmother once more.\n“Would you start again? I suspect your husband was not listening carefully\nthe last time.” He glanced at Shallan. “And does the child need to be here?”\nShallan left without a word. It was what she’d wanted anyway, though\nshe did feel bad leaving Father. He didn’t often speak with her, let alone ask\nfor her opinion, but he did seem to be stronger when she was near.\nHe was so disconcerted that he didn’t even send one of the guards with\nher. She slipped out of the box, satchel under her arm, and passed through\nthe Davar servants who were preparing her father’s meal.\nFreedom.\nFreedom was as valuable as an emerald broam to Shallan, and as rare as\na larkin. She hurried away, lest her father realize he had given no orders for\nher to be accompanied. One of the guards at the perimeter—Jix—stepped\ntoward her anyway, but then looked back at the box. He went that way\ninstead, perhaps intending to ask if he should follow.\nBest to not be easily found when he returned. Shallan took a step toward\nthe fair, with its exotic merchants and wonderful sights. There would be\nguessing games and perhaps a Worldsinger telling tales of distant kingdoms.\nOver the polite clapping of the lighteyes watching the duel behind her, she\ncould hear drums from the common darkeyes along with singing and\nmerriment.\nWork first. Darkness lay over her house like a storm’s shadow. She\nwould find the sun. She would.\nThat meant turning back to the dueling grounds, for now. She rounded\nthe back of the boxes, weaving between parshmen who bowed and darkeyes\nwho gave her nods or bows, depending on their rank. She eventually found\na box where several lesser lighteyed families shared space in the shade."

She eventually found\na box where several lesser lighteyed families shared space in the shade.\nEylita, daughter of Brightlord Tavinar, sat on the end, just within the\nsunlight shining through the side of the box. She stared at the duelists with a\nvapid expression, head slightly cocked, a whimsical smile on her face. Her\nlong hair was a pure black.\nShallan stepped up beside the box and hissed at her. The older girl\nturned, frowning, then raised hands to her lips. She glanced at her parents,\nthen leaned down. “Shallan!”\n“I told you to expect me,” Shallan whispered back. “Did you think\nabout what I wrote you?”\nEylita reached into the pocket of her dress, then slipped out a small\nnote. She grinned mischievously and nodded.\nShallan took the note. “You’ll be able to get away?”\n“I’ll need to take my handmaid, but otherwise I can go where I want.”\nWhat would that be like?\nShallan ducked away quickly. Technically, she outranked Eylita’s\nparents, but age was a funny thing among the lighteyes. Sometimes, the\nhigher-ranked child didn’t seem nearly as important when speaking to\nadults of a lower dahn. Besides, Brightlord and Brightness Tavinar had been\nthere on that day, when the bastard had come. They were not fond of Father,\nor his children.\nShallan backed away from the boxes, then turned toward the fair itself.\nHere, she paused nervously. The Middlefest Fair was an intimidating\ncollage of people and places. Nearby, a group of tenners drank at long\ntables and placed bets on the matches. The lowest rank of lighteyes, they\nwere barely above darkeyes. They not only had to work for their living,\nthey weren’t even merchants or master craftsmen. They were just… people.\nHelaran had said there were many of them in the cities. As many as there\nwere darkeyes. That seemed very odd to her.\nOdd and fascinating at the same time. She itched to find a corner to\nwatch where she would not be noticed, her sketchpad out and her\nimagination boiling. Instead, she forced herself to move around the edge of\nthe fair. The tent that her brothers had spoken of would be on the outer\nperimeter, wouldn’t it?\nDarkeyed fairgoers gave her a wide berth, and she found herself afraid.\nHer father spoke of how a young lighteyed girl could be a target for the\nbrutish people of the lower classes. Surely nobody would harm her here in\nthe open, with so many people about. Still, she clutched her satchel to her\nchest and found herself trembling as she walked.\nWhat would it be like, to be brave like Helaran? As her mother had\nbeen.\nHer mother…\n“Brightness?”\nShallan shook herself. How long had she been standing there, on the\npath? The sun had moved.

She turned one\nway, then the other. “Um… We need to find the gambling pavilion.”\n“That’s not a place for a lady.” Jix eyed her. “Particularly not one of\nyour age, Brightness.”\n“Well, I suppose you can go tell my father what I’m doing.” She\nshuffled from one foot to the other.\n“And in the meantime,” Jix said, “you’ll try to find it on your own,\nwon’t you? Go in by yourself if you find it?”\nShe shrugged, blushing. That was exactly what she’d do.\n“Which means I’d have left you wandering around in a place like that\nwithout protection.” He groaned softly. “Why do you defy him like this,\nBrightness? You’re just going to make him angry.”\n“I think… I think he will anger no matter what I or anyone does,” she\nsaid. “The sun will shine. The highstorms will blow. And Father will yell.\nThat’s just how life is.” She bit her lip. “The gambling pavilion? I promise\nthat I will be brief.”\n“This way,” Jix said. He didn’t walk particularly quickly as he led her,\nand he frequently glared at darkeyed fairgoers who passed. Jix was\nlighteyed, but only of the eighth dahn.\n“Pavilion” turned out to be too grand a term for the patched and ripped\ntarp strung up at the edge of the fairgrounds. She’d have found it on her\nown soon enough. The thick canvas, with sides that hung down a few feet,\nmade it surprisingly dark inside.\nMen crowded together in there. The few women that Shallan saw had\nthe fingers cut out of the gloves on their safehands. Scandalous. She found\nherself blushing as she stopped at the perimeter, looking in at the dark,\nshifting forms. Men shouted inside with raw voices, any sense of Vorin\ndecorum left out in the sunlight. This was, indeed, not a place for someone\nlike her. She had trouble believing it was a place for anyone.\n“How about I go in for you,” Jix said. “Is it a bet you’re wanting to—”\nShallan pushed forward. Ignoring her own panic, her discomfort, she\nmoved into the darkness. Because if she did not, then it meant that none of\nthem were resisting, that nothing would change.\nJix stayed at her side, shoving her some space.

If she wouldn’t obey social\nconventions by staying out, they didn’t have to obey them by showing her\ndeference.\n“Is there something specific you’re searching for?” Jix asked. “Cards?\nGuessing games?”\n“Axehound fights.”\nJix groaned. “You’re gonna end up stabbed, and I’m gonna end up on a\nroasting spit.

His disheveled hair and\nstooped posture gave him an uncaring look, but his eyes… his eyes lusted.\nHe watched the poor animals killing one another, fixated on them with the\nintensity of a woman reading a powerful novel.\nShallan stepped up to him, Jix remaining a little ways behind. Now that\nhe’d seen Balat, the guard relaxed.\n“Balat?” Shallan asked timidly. “Balat!”\nHe glanced at her, then nearly toppled off his bench. He scrambled up to\nhis feet. “What in the… Shallan! Get out of here. What are you doing?” He\nreached for her.\nShe cringed down despite herself. He sounded like Father. As he took\nher by the shoulder, she held up the note from Eylita. The lavender paper,\ndusted with perfume, seemed to glow.\nBalat hesitated. To the side, one axehound bit deeply into the leg of the\nother. Blood sprayed the ground, deep violet.\n“What is it?” Balat asked. “That is the glyphpair of House Tavinar.”\n“It’s from Eylita.”\n“Eylita? The daughter? Why… what…”\nShallan broke the seal, opening the letter to read for him. “She wishes to\nwalk with you along the fairgrounds stream. She says she’ll be waiting\nthere, with her handmaid, if you want to come.”\nBalat ran a hand through his curling hair. “Eylita? She’s here. Of course\nshe’s here. Everyone is here. You talked to her? Why— But—”\n“I know how you’ve looked at her,” Shallan said. “The few times\nyou’ve been near.”\n“So you talked to her?” Balat demanded. “Without my permission? You\nsaid I’d be interested in something like”—he took the letter—“like this?”\nShallan nodded, wrapping her arms around herself."

He bet because it was\nexpected of him, but he didn’t come here for the money—unlike Jushu\nwould.\nBalat ran his hand through his hair again, then looked back at the letter.\nHe wasn’t a cruel man. She knew it was a strange thing to think,\nconsidering what he sometimes did. Shallan knew the kindness he showed,\nthe strength that hid within him. He hadn’t acquired this fascination with\ndeath until Mother had left them. He could come back, stop being like that.\nHe could.\n“I need…” Balat looked out of the tent. “I need to go! She’ll be waiting\nfor me. I shouldn’t make her wait.” He buttoned up his coat.\nShallan nodded eagerly, following him from the pavilion. Jix trailed\nalong behind, though a couple of men called out to him. He must be known\nin the pavilion.\nBalat stepped out into the sunlight. He seemed a changed man, just like\nthat.\n“Balat?” Shallan asked. “I didn’t see Jushu in there with you.”\n“He didn’t come to the pavilion.”\n“What? I thought—”\n“I don’t know where he went,” Balat said. “He met some people right\nafter we arrived.” He looked toward the distant stream that ran down from\nthe heights and through a channel around the fairgrounds. “What do I say to\nher?”\n“How should I know?”\n“You’re a woman too.”\n“I’m fourteen!” She wouldn’t spend time courting, anyway. Father\nwould choose her a husband. His only daughter was too precious to be\nwasted on something fickle, like her own powers of decision.\n“I guess… I guess I’ll just talk to her,” Balat said. He jogged off without\nanother word.\nShallan watched him go, then sat down on a rock and trembled, arms\naround herself. That place… the tent… it had been horrible.\nShe sat there for an extended time, feeling ashamed of her weakness,\nbut also proud. She’d done it. It was small, but she’d done something.\nEventually, she rose and nodded to Jix, letting him lead the way back\ntoward their box. Father should be finished with his meeting by now.\nIt turned out that he had finished that meeting only to start another. A\nman she did not know sat next to Father with a cup of chilled water in one\nhand. Tall, slender, and blue-eyed, he had deep black hair without a hint of\nimpurity and wore clothing the same shade. He glanced at Shallan as she\nstepped up into the box.\nThe man started, dropping his cup to the table. He caught it with a swift\nlunge, keeping it from tipping over, then turned to stare at her with a slack\njaw.\nIt was gone in a second, replaced with an expression of practiced\nindifference.\n“Clumsy fool!” Father said.\nThe newcomer turned away from Shallan, speaking softly to Father.\nShallan’s stepmother stood to the side, with the cooks. Shallan slipped over\nto her. “Who is that?”"

Helaran?”\nMalise nodded.\nShallan turned back to the newcomer. She caught, with a subtle\nmovement, the man slipping something from his coat pocket and moving it\nup toward the drinks. A shock coursed through Shallan. She raised a hand.\nPoison—\nThe newcomer covertly dumped the pouch’s contents into his own\ndrink, then raised it to his lips, gulping down the powder. What had it been?\nShallan lowered her hand. The newcomer stood up a moment later. He\ndidn’t bow to Father as he left. He gave Shallan a smile, then was down the\nsteps and out of the box.\nWord from Helaran. What had it been? Shallan timidly moved to the\ntable. “Father?”\nFather’s eyes were on the duel in the center of the ring. Two men with\nswords, no shields, harking back to classical ideals. Their sweeping\nmethods of fighting were said to be an imitation of fighting with a\nShardblade.\n“Word from Nan Helaran?” Shallan prodded.\n“You will not speak his name,” Father said.\n“I—”\n“You will not speak of that one,” Father said, looking to her, thunder in\nhis expression. “Today I declare him disinherited. Tet Balat is officially now\nNan Balat, Wikim becomes Tet, Jushu becomes Asha. I have only three\nsons.”\nShe knew better than to push him when he was like this. But how would\nshe discover what the messenger had said? She sank into her chair, shaken\nagain.\n“Your brothers avoid me,” Father said, watching the duel. “Not one\nchooses to dine with their father as would be proper.”\nShallan folded her hands in her lap.\n“Jushu is probably drinking somewhere,” Father said. “The Stormfather\nonly knows where Balat has run off to. Wikim refuses to leave the\ncarriage.” He downed the wine in his cup. “Will you speak with him? This\nhas not been a good day. If I went to him, I… worry what I would do.”\nShallan rose, then rested a hand on her father’s shoulder. He slumped,\nleaning forward, one hand around the empty wine flagon. He raised his\nother hand and patted hers on his shoulder, his eyes distant. He did try. They\nall did.\nShallan sought out their carriage, which stood parked with a number of\nothers near the western slope of the fairgrounds. Jella trees here rose high,\ntheir hardened trunks colored the light brown of crem. The needles sprouted\nlike a thousand tongues of fire from each limb, though the nearest ones\npulled in as she approached.\nShe was surprised to see a mink slinking in the shadows; she’d expected\nall those in the area to have been trapped by now.

The coachmen played\ncards in a ring nearby; some of them had to stay and watch the carriages,\nthough Shallan had heard Ren speaking of some kind of rotation so that\nthey all got a chance at the fair. In fact, Ren wasn’t there at the moment,\nthough the other coachmen bowed as she passed.\nWikim sat in their carriage. The slender, pale youth was only fifteen\nmonths older than Shallan. He shared some resemblance to his twin, but\nfew people mistook them for one another. Jushu looked older, and Wikim\nwas so thin he looked sickly.\nShallan climbed in to sit across from Wikim, setting her satchel on the\nseat beside her.\n“Did Father send you,” Wikim asked, “or did you come on one of your\nnew little missions of mercy?”\n“Both?”\nWikim turned away from her, looking out the window toward the trees,\naway from the fair. “You can’t fix us, Shallan. Jushu will destroy himself.\nIt’s only a matter of time. Balat is becoming Father, step by step. Malise\nspends one night in two weeping. Father will kill her one of these days, like\nhe did Mother.”\n“And you?” Shallan asked. It was the wrong thing to say, and she knew\nit the moment it came out of her mouth.\n“Me? I won’t be around to see any of it. I’ll be dead by then.”\nShallan wrapped her arms around herself, pulling her legs up beneath\nher on the seat. Brightness Hasheh would have chided her for the unladylike\nposture.\nWhat did she do? What did she say? He’s right, she thought. I can’t fix\nthis. Helaran could have. I can’t.\nThey were all slowly unraveling.\n“So what was it?” Wikim said. “Out of curiosity, what did you come up\nwith to ‘save’ me? I’m guessing you used the girl on Balat.”\nShe nodded.\n“You were obvious about that,” Wikim said. “With the letters you sent\nher. Jushu? What of him?”\n“I have a list of the day’s duels,” Shallan whispered. “He so wishes he\ncould duel. If I show him the fights, maybe he’ll want to come watch\nthem.”\n“You’ll have to find him first,” Wikim said with a snort. “And what\nabout me? You have to know that neither swords nor pretty faces will work\nfor me.”\nFeeling a fool, Shallan dug in her satchel and came out with several\nsheets of paper.\n“Drawings?”\n“Math problems.”\nWikim frowned and took them from her, absently scratching the side of\nhis face as he looked them over. “I’m no ardent. I’ll not be boxed up and\nforced to spend my days convincing people to listen to the Almighty—who\nsuspiciously has nothing to say for himself.”\n“That doesn’t mean you can’t study,” Shallan said. “I gathered those\nfrom Father’s books, equations for determining highstorm timing. I\ntranslated and simplified the writing to glyphs, so you could read them.

How long did this take you?”\nShe shrugged. It had taken weeks, but she had nothing but time. Days\nsitting in the gardens, evenings sitting in her room, the occasional visit to\nthe ardents for some peaceful tutoring about the Almighty. It was good to\nhave things to do.\n“This is stupid,” Wikim said, lowering the papers. “What do you think\nyou’ll accomplish? I can’t believe you wasted so much time on this.”\nShallan bowed her head and then, blinking tears, scrambled out of the\ncarriage. It felt horrible—not just Wikim’s words, but the way her emotions\nbetrayed her. She couldn’t hold them in.\nShe hastened away from the carriages, hoping the coachmen wouldn’t\nsee her wiping her eyes with her safehand. She sat down on a stone and\ntried to compose herself, but failed, tears flowing freely. She turned her\nhead aside as a few parshmen trotted past, running their master’s\naxehounds. There would be several hunts as part of the festivities.\n“Axehound,” a voice said from behind her.\nShallan jumped, safehand to breast, and spun.\nHe rested up on a tree limb, wearing his black outfit. He moved as she\nsaw him, and the spiky leaves around him retreated in a wave of vanishing\nred and orange. It was the messenger who had spoken to Father earlier.\n“I have wondered,” the messenger said, “if any of you find the term\nodd. You know what an axe is. But what is a hound?”\n“Why does that matter?” Shallan asked.\n“Because it is a word,” the messenger replied. “A simple word with a\nworld embedded inside, like a bud waiting to open.” He studied her. “I did\nnot expect to find you here.”\n“I…” Her instincts told her to back away from this strange man. And\nyet, he had news of Helaran—news her father would never share. “Where\ndid you expect to find me? At the dueling grounds?”\nThe man swung around the branch and dropped to the ground.\nShallan stepped backward.\n“No need for that,” the man said, settling onto a rock. “You needn’t fear\nme. I’m terribly ineffective at hurting people. I blame my upbringing.”\n“You have news of my brother Helaran.”\nThe messenger nodded. “He is a very determined young man.”\n“Where is he?”\n“Doing things he finds very important. I would fault him for it, as I find\nnothing more frightening than a man trying to do what he has decided is\nimportant. Very little in the world has ever gone astray—at least on a grand\nscale—because a person decided to be frivolous.”\n“He is well, though?” she asked.\n“Well enough. The message for your father was that he has eyes nearby,\nand is watching.”\nNo wonder it had put Father in a bad mood. “Where is he?” Shallan\nsaid, timidly stepping forward. “Did he tell you to speak to me?”\n“I’m sorry, young one,” the man said, expression softening. “He gave"

I assumed he’d sent you here. I mean, that coming to us was your\nprimary purpose.”\n“Turns out that it was. Tell me, young one. Do spren speak to you?”\nThe lights going out, life drained from them.\nTwisted symbols the eye should not see.\nHer mother’s soul in a box.\n“I…” she said. “No. Why would a spren speak to me?”\n“No voices?” the man said, leaning forward. “Do spheres go dark when\nyou are near?”\n“I’m sorry,” Shallan said, “but I should be getting back to my father. He\nwill be missing me.”\n“Your father is slowly destroying your family,” the messenger said.\n“Your brother was right on that count. He was wrong about everything\nelse.”\n“Such as?”\n“Look.” The man nodded back toward the carriages. She was at the\nright angle to see into the window of her father’s carriage. She squinted.\nInside, Wikim leaned forward, using a pencil taken from her satchel—\nwhich she’d left behind. He scribbled at the mathematical problems she’d\nleft.\nHe was smiling.\nWarmth. That warmth she felt, a deep glow, was like the joy she had\nknown before. Long ago. Before everything had gone wrong. Before\nMother.\nThe messenger whispered. “Two blind men waited at the end of an era,\ncontemplating beauty. They sat atop the world’s highest cliff, overlooking\nthe land and seeing nothing.”\n“Huh?” She looked to him.\n“‘Can beauty be taken from a man?’ the first asked the second.\n“‘It was taken from me,’ the second replied. ‘For I cannot remember it.’\nThis man was blinded in a childhood accident. ‘I pray to the God Beyond\neach night to restore my sight, so that I may find beauty again.’\n“‘Is beauty something one must see, then?’ the first asked.\n“‘Of course. That is its nature. How can you appreciate a work of art\nwithout seeing it?’\n“‘I can hear a work of music,’ the first said.\n“‘Very well, you can hear some kinds of beauty—but you cannot know\nfull beauty without sight. You can know only a small portion of beauty.’\n“‘A sculpture,’ the first said. ‘Can I not feel its curves and slopes, the\ntouch of the chisel that transformed common rock into uncommon\nwonder?’\n“‘I suppose,’ said the second, ‘that you can know the beauty of a\nsculpture.’\n“‘And what of the beauty of food? Is it not a work of art when a chef\ncrafts a masterpiece to delight the tastes?’\n“‘I suppose,’ said the second, ‘that you can know the beauty of a chef’s\nart.’\n“‘And what of the beauty of a woman,’ the first said. ‘Can I not know\nher beauty in the softness of her caress, the kindness of her voice, the\nkeenness of her mind as she reads philosophy to me?

Your tongue taken out, your mouth forced shut,\nyour sense of smell destroyed? What if your skin were burned so that you\ncould no longer feel? What if all that remained to you was pain? You could\nnot know beauty then. It can be taken from a man.’”\nThe messenger stopped, cocking his head at Shallan.\n“What?” she asked.\n“What think you? Can beauty be taken from a man? If he could not\ntouch, taste, smell, hear, see… what if all he knew was pain? Has that man\nhad beauty taken from him?”\n“I…” What did this have to do with anything? “Does the pain change\nday by day?”\n“Let us say it does,” the messenger said.\n“Then beauty, to that person, would be the times when the pain lessens.\nWhy are you telling me this story?”\nThe messenger smiled. “To be human is to seek beauty, Shallan. Do not\ndespair, do not end the hunt because thorns grow in your way. Tell me, what\nis the most beautiful thing you can imagine?”\n“Father is probably wondering where I am…”\n“Indulge me,” the messenger said. “I will tell you where your brother\nis.”\n“A wonderful painting, then. That is the most beautiful thing.”\n“Lies,” the messenger said. “Tell me the truth. What is it, child? Beauty,\nto you.”\n“I…” What was it? “Mother still lives,” she found herself whispering,\nmeeting his eyes.\n“And?”\n“And we are in the gardens,” Shallan continued. “She is speaking to my\nfather, and he is laughing. Laughing and holding her. We are all there,\nincluding Helaran. He never left. The people my mother knew… Dreder…\nnever came to our home. Mother loves me. She teaches me philosophy, and\nshe shows me how to draw.”\n“Good,” the messenger said. “But you can do better than that. What is\nthat place? What does it feel like?”\n“It’s spring,” Shallan shot back, growing annoyed. “And the mossvines\nbloom a vigorous red. They smell sweet, and the air is moist from the\nmorning’s highstorm. Mother whispers, but there is music to her tone, and\nFather’s laugh doesn’t echo—it rises high into the air, bathing us all.\n“Helaran is teaching Jushu swords, and they spar nearby.

I feel\nwarm, despite the slight chill to the air. I have a steaming cup of cider\nbeside me, and I taste the sweetness in my mouth from the sip I just took.

She heard her\nmother’s voice, saw Jushu giving up spheres to Balat as he lost the duel, but\nlaughing as he paid, uncaring of the loss. She could feel the air, smell the\nscents, hear the sounds of songlings in the brush. Almost, it became real.\nWisps of Light rose before her. The messenger had gotten out a handful\nof spheres and held them toward her while staring into her eyes. The steamy\nStormlight rose between them. Shallan lifted her fingers, the image of her\nideal life wrapped around her like a comforter.\nNo.\nShe drew back. The misty light faded.\n“I see,” the messenger said softly. “You do not yet understand the nature\nof lies. I had that trouble myself, long ago. The Shards here are very strict.\nYou will have to see the truth, child, before you can expand upon it. Just as\na man should know the law before he breaks it.”\nShadows from her past shifted in the depths, surfacing just briefly\ntoward the light. “Could you help?”\n“No. Not now. You aren’t ready, for one, and I have work to be about.\nAnother day. Keep cutting at those thorns, strong one, and make a path for\nthe light. The things you fight aren’t completely natural.” He stood up, then\nbowed to her.\n“My brother,” she said.\n“He is in Alethkar.”\nAlethkar? “Why?”\n“Because that is where he feels he is needed, of course. If I see him\nagain, I will give him word of you.” The messenger walked away on light\nfeet, his steps smooth, almost like moves in a dance.\nShallan watched him go, the deep things within her settling again,\nreturning to the forgotten parts of her mind. She realized she had not even\nasked the man his name.\n46. Patriots\nWhen Simol was informed of the arrival of the\nEdgedancers, a concealed consternation and\nterror, as is common in such cases, fell upon him;\nalthough they were not the most demanding of\norders, their graceful, limber movements hid a\ndeadliness that was, by this time, quite renowned;\nalso, they were the most articulate and refined of\nthe Radiants.\nFrom Words of Radiance, chapter 20, page\n12\nKaladin reached the end of the line of bridgemen. They stood at\nattention, spears to shoulders, eyes forward. The transformation was\nmarvelous. He nodded under the darkening sky.\n“Impressive,” he said to Pitt, the sergeant of Bridge Seventeen. “I’ve\nrarely seen such a fine platoon of spearmen.”\nIt was the kind of lie that commanders learned to give. Kaladin didn’t\nmention how some of the bridgemen shuffled while they stood, or how their\nmaneuvers in formation were sloppy. They were trying. He could sense it in\ntheir earnest expressions, and in the way they had begun taking pride in\ntheir uniforms, their identity. They were ready to patrol, at least close to the\nwarcamps. He made a mental note to have Teft start taking them out in a\nrotation with the other two crews that were ready."

He made a mental note to have Teft start taking them out in a\nrotation with the other two crews that were ready.\nKaladin was proud of them, and he let them know it as the hour\nstretched long and night arrived. He then dismissed them to their evening\nmeal, which smelled quite different from Rock’s Horneater stew. Bridge\nSeventeen considered their nightly bean curry to be part of their identity.\nIndividuality through meal choice; Kaladin found that amusing as he moved\noff into the night, shouldering his spear. He had three more crews to look in\non.\nThe next, Bridge Eighteen, was one of those having problems. Their\nsergeant, though earnest, didn’t have the presence necessary for a good\nofficer. Or, well, none of the bridgemen had that. He was just particularly\nweak. Prone to begging instead of ordering, awkward in social situations.\nIt couldn’t all be blamed on Vet, however. He’d also been given a\nparticularly discordant group of men. Kaladin found the soldiers of\nEighteen sitting in isolated bunches, eating their evening meal. No laughter,\nno camaraderie. They weren’t as solitary as they’d been as bridgemen.\nInstead, they’d splintered into little cliques who didn’t mingle.\nSergeant Vet called them to order and they rose sluggishly, not\nbothering to stand in a straight line or salute. Kaladin saw the truth in their\neyes. What could he do to them? Surely nothing as bad as their lives had\nbeen as bridgemen. So why make an effort?\nKaladin spoke to them of motivation and unity for a time. I’ll need to do\nanother training session in the chasms with this lot, he thought. And if that\ndidn’t work either… well, he’d probably have to break them up, stick them\nin other platoons that were working.\nHe eventually left Eighteen, shaking his head. They didn’t seem to want\nto be soldiers. Why had they taken Dalinar’s offer then, instead of leaving?\nBecause they don’t want to make choices anymore, he thought. Choices\ncan be hard.\nHe knew how that felt. Storms, but he did. He remembered sitting and\nstaring at a blank wall, too morose to even get up and go kill himself.\nHe shivered. Those were not days he wanted to remember.\nAs he made his way toward Bridge Nineteen, Syl floated past on a\ncurrent of wind in the form of a small patch of mist. She melded into a\nribbon of light and zipped around him in circles before coming to rest on\nhis shoulder.\n“Everyone else is eating their dinners,” Syl said.\n“Good,” Kaladin said.\n“That wasn’t a status report, Kaladin,” she said. “It was a point of\ncontention.”\n“Contention?” He stopped in the darkness near the barrack of Bridge\nNineteen, whose men were doing well, eating around their fire as a group.\n“You’re working,” Syl said. “Still.”\n“I need to get these men ready.” He turned his head to look at her. “You\nknow something is coming.

Very infrequently, but there.”\n“Something is coming,” Kaladin said. “That countdown points right\ntoward the Weeping. Whatever happens then, I’ll have the bridgemen ready\nto weather it.”\n“Well, you won’t if you drop dead from exhaustion first!” Syl hesitated.\n“People really can do that, right? I heard Teft saying he felt like he was\ngoing to do so.”\n“Teft likes to exaggerate,” Kaladin said. “It’s one mark of a good\nsergeant.”\nSyl frowned. “And that last part… was a joke?”\n“Yes.”\n“Ah.” She looked into his eyes. “Rest anyway, Kaladin. Please.”\nKaladin looked toward Bridge Four’s barrack. It was a distance away,\ndown the rows, but he thought he could hear Rock’s laughter echoing\nthrough the night.\nFinally, he sighed, acknowledging his exhaustion. He could check on\nthe last two platoons tomorrow. Spear in hand, he turned and hiked back.\nThe advent of darkness meant it would be about two hours before men\nstarted turning in for the night. Kaladin arrived to the familiar scent of\nRock’s stew, though Hobber—sitting on a tall stump the men had fashioned\nfor him, a blanket across his grey, useless legs—was doing the serving.\nRock stood nearby, arms folded, looking proud.\nRenarin was there, taking and washing the dishes of those who’d\nfinished. He did that every night, kneeling quietly beside the washbasin in\nhis bridgeman uniform. The lad certainly was earnest. He didn’t display any\nof the spoiled temperament of his brother. Though he had insisted on\njoining them, he often sat at the edges of the group, near the back of the\nbridgemen at night. Such an odd young man.\nKaladin passed Hobber and gripped the man’s shoulder. He nodded,\nmeeting Hobber’s eyes, raising a fist. Fight on. Kaladin reached for some\nstew, then froze.\nSitting nearby on a log were not one, but three beefy, thick-armed\nHerdazians. All wore Bridge Four uniforms, and Kaladin only recognized\nPunio out of the three.\nKaladin found Lopen nearby, staring at his hand—which he held before\nhimself in a fist for some reason. Kaladin had long since given up on\nunderstanding Lopen.\n“Three?” Kaladin demanded.\n“Cousins!” Lopen replied, looking up.\n“You have too many of those,” Kaladin said.\n“That’s impossible! Rod, Huio, say hello!”\n“Bridge Four,” the two men said, raising their bowls.\nKaladin shook his head, accepting his own stew and then walking past\nthe cauldron into the darker area beside the barrack. He peeked into the\nstorage room, and found Shen stacking sacks of tallew grain there, lit only\nby a single diamond chip.\n“Shen?” Kaladin said.\nThe parshman continued stacking bags.\n“Fall in and attention!” Kaladin barked."

He asked if I\ntrusted you. I told him the truth.” Kaladin held out his spear to the\nparshman. “I do.”\nShen looked from the spear to Kaladin, dark eyes hesitant.\n“Bridge Four doesn’t have slaves,” Kaladin said. “I’m sorry for being\nfrightened before.” He urged the man to take the spear, and Shen finally did\nso. “Leyten and Natam practice in the mornings with a few men. They’re\nwilling to help you learn so that you don’t have to train with the\ngreenvines.”\nShen held the spear with what seemed to be reverence. Kaladin turned\nto leave the storage room.\n“Sir,” Shen said.\nKaladin paused.\n“You are,” Shen said, speaking in his slow way, “a good man.”\n“I’ve spent my life being judged for my eyes, Shen. I won’t do\nsomething similar to you because of your skin.”\n“Sir, I—” The parshman seemed troubled by something.\n“Kaladin!” Moash’s voice came from outside.\n“Was there something you wanted to say?” Kaladin asked Shen.\n“Later,” the parshman said. “Later.”\nKaladin nodded, then stepped out to see what the disturbance was. He\nfound Moash looking for him near the cauldron.\n“Kaladin!” Moash said, spotting him. “Come on. We’re going out, and\nyou’re coming with us. Even Rock is coming tonight.”\n“Ha! Stew is in good hands,” Rock said. “I will go do this thing. Will be\ngood to get away from stink of little bridgemen.”\n“Hey!” Drehy said.\n“Ah. And stink of big bridgemen too.”\n“Come on,” Moash said, waving to Kaladin. “You promised.”\nHe’d done no such thing. He just wanted to settle down by the fire, eat\nhis stew, and watch the flamespren. Everyone was looking at him, though.\nEven the ones who weren’t going with Moash tonight.\n“I…” Kaladin said. “Fine. Let’s go.”\nThey cheered and clapped. Storming fools. They cheered to see their\ncommander go out drinking? Kaladin slurped down a few bites of stew,\nthen handed the rest to Hobber. With reluctance, he then walked over to join\nMoash, as did Lopen, Peet, and Sigzil.\n“You know,” Kaladin growled under his breath to Syl, “if this had been\none of my old spearman crews, I’d assume they wanted me out of the camp\nso they could get away with something while I’m gone.”\n“I doubt it’s that,” Syl said, frowning.\n“No,” Kaladin said. “These men just want to see me as human.” He did\nneed to go, for that reason. He was already too separate from the men. He\ndidn’t want them thinking of him as they would a lighteyes."

He\ndidn’t want them thinking of him as they would a lighteyes.\n“Ha!” Rock said, jogging up to join them. “These men, they claim they\ncan drink more than Horneater. Airsick lowlanders. Is not possible.”\n“A drinking contest?” Kaladin said, groaning inwardly. What was he\ngetting into?\n“None of us are on duty until the late morning,” Sigzil said with a\nshrug. Teft was watching the Kholins overnight, along with Leyten’s team.\n“Tonight,” Lopen said, finger to the air, “I will be victorious. It is said\nyou should never bet against the one-armed Herdazian in a drinking\ncontest!”\n“It is?” Moash asked.\n“It will be said,” Lopen continued, “you should never bet against the\none-armed Herdazian in a drinking contest!”\n“You weigh about as much as a starved axehound, Lopen,” Moash said\nskeptically.\n“Ah, but I have focus.”\nThey continued, turning down a pathway that led toward the market.\nThe warcamp was laid out with blocks of barracks forming a large circle\naround the lighteyed buildings closer to the center. On the way out toward\nthe market, which was in the outer ring of camp followers beyond the\nsoldiers, they passed plenty of other barracks manned by ordinary soldiers\n—and the men there were busy in tasks that Kaladin had rarely seen in\nSadeas’s army. Sharpening spears, oiling breastplates, before their dinner\ncall came.\nKaladin’s men weren’t the only ones going out for the night, though.\nOther groups of soldiers had already eaten, and these strolled toward the\nmarket, laughing. They were recovering, slowly, from the slaughter that had\nleft Dalinar’s army crippled.\nThe market was aglow with life, torches and oil lanterns shining from\nmost buildings. Kaladin wasn’t surprised. An ordinary army would have\nhad camp followers aplenty, and that was for a moving army. Here,\nmerchants showed off wares. Criers sold news they claimed had come via\nspanreed, reporting events in the world. What was that about a war in Jah\nKeved? And a new emperor in Azir? Kaladin had only a vague idea of\nwhere that was.\nSigzil jogged over to get an earful of news, paying the crier a sphere\nwhile Lopen and Rock argued which tavern was the best to visit for the\nnight. Kaladin watched the flow of life. Soldiers passing on the night watch.\nA group of chatting darkeyed women moving from spice merchant to spice\nmerchant. A lighteyed courier posting projected highstorm dates and times\non a board, her husband yawning nearby and looking bored—as if he’d\nbeen forced to come along to keep her company. The Weeping was coming\nup soon, the time of constant rain with no highstorms—the only break was\nLightday, right in the middle. It was an off year in the thousand-day cycle of\ntwo years, which meant the Weeping would be a calm one this time.\n“Enough arguing,” Moash said to Rock, Lopen, and Peet. “We’re going\nto the Ornery Chull.”\n“Aw!” Rock said. “But they do not have Horneater lagers!”"

That tavern had been\nhis choice as well.\nSigzil got back from hearing the news, and he’d apparently stopped\nsomewhere else as well, as he carried something steaming and wrapped in\npaper.\n“Not you too,” Kaladin said, groaning.\n“It’s good,” Sigzil said defensively, then took a bite of the chouta.\n“You don’t even know what it is.”\n“Of course I do.” Sigzil hesitated. “Hey, Lopen. What’s in this stuff?”\n“Flangria,” Lopen said happily as Rock ran off to the street vendor to\nget himself some chouta too.\n“Which is?” Kaladin asked.\n“Meat.”\n“What kind of meat?”\n“The meaty kind.”\n“Soulcast,” Kaladin said, looking at Sigzil.\n“You ate Soulcast food every night as a bridgeman,” Sigzil said,\nshrugging and taking a bite.\n“Because I had no choice. Look. He’s frying that bread.”\n“You fry the flangria too,” Lopen said. “Make little balls of it, mixed\nwith ground lavis. Batter it up and fry it, then stuff it in fried bread and pour\non gravy.” He made a satisfied sound, licking his lips.\n“It’s cheaper than water,” Peet noted as Rock jogged back.\n“That’s probably because even the grain is Soulcast,” Kaladin said. “It\nwill all taste like mold. Rock, I’m disappointed in you.”\nThe Horneater looked sheepish, but took a bite. His chouta crunched.\n“Shells?” Kaladin asked.\n“Cremling claws.” Rock grinned. “Deep-fried.”\nKaladin sighed, but they finally struck out again through the crowd,\neventually reaching a wooden building built on the leeward side of a larger\nstone structure. Everything here was, of course, arranged so that as many\ndoorways as possible could point away from the Origin, streets designed so\nthat they could run east to west and provide a way for winds to blow.\nWarm, orange light spilled from the tavern. Firelight. No tavern would\nuse spheres for light. Even with locks on the lanterns, the rich glow of\nspheres might be just a little too tempting for the intoxicated patrons.\nShouldering their way inside, the bridgemen were confronted by a low roar\nof chatter, yelling, and singing.\n“We’ll never find seats,” Kaladin said over the din. Even with the\nreduced population of Dalinar’s warcamp, this place was packed.\n“Of course we will find seat,” Rock said, grinning. “We have secret\nweapon.” He pointed to where Peet, oval-faced and quiet, was working his\nway through the room toward the front bar. A pretty darkeyed woman stood\npolishing a glass there, and she smiled brightly when she saw Peet.\n“So,” Sigzil said to Kaladin, “have you given thought to where you’re\ngoing to house the married men of Bridge Four?”"

Looking at Peet’s expression as he leaned across the bar,\nchatting with the woman, it seemed that might not be far off. Kaladin hadn’t\ngiven any thought to it. He should have. He knew that Rock was married—\nthe Horneater had already sent letters to his family, though the Peaks were\nso far away, news had not yet returned. Teft had been married, but his wife\nwas dead, as was much of his family.\nSome of the others might have families. When they’d been bridgemen,\nthey hadn’t spoken much of their pasts, but Kaladin had teased out hints\nhere and there. They would slowly reclaim normal lives, and families would\nbe part of that, particularly here with the stable warcamp.\n“Storms!” Kaladin said, raising a hand to his head. “I’ll have to ask for\nmore space.”\n“There are many barracks partitioned to allow families,” Sigzil noted.\n“And some of the married soldiers rent places in the market. Men could\nmove to one of those choices.”\n“This thing would break up Bridge Four!” Rock said. “It cannot be\nallowed.”\nWell, married men tended to make better soldiers. He’d have to find a\nway to make it work. There were a lot of empty barracks around in\nDalinar’s camp now. Maybe he should ask for a few more.\nKaladin nodded toward the woman at the bar. “She doesn’t own the\nplace, I assume.”\n“No, Ka is just barmaid,” Rock said. “Peet is quite taken with her.”\n“We’ll need to see if she can read,” Kaladin said, stepping aside as a\nsemi-drunk patron pushed out into the night. “Storms, but it would be good\nto have someone around to do that.” In a normal army, Kaladin would be\nlighteyed, and his wife or sister would act as the battalion’s scribe and clerk.\nPeet waved them over, and Ka led them through to a table set off to the\nside. Kaladin settled himself with his back to the wall, near enough to a\nwindow that he could look out if he wanted, but where he wouldn’t be\nsilhouetted. He spared some pity for Rock’s chair as the Horneater settled\ndown. Rock was the only one in the crew who had a few inches’ height on\nKaladin, and he was practically twice as broad.\n“Horneater lager?” Rock asked hopefully, looking at Ka.\n“It melts our cups,” she said. “Ale?”\n“Ale,” Rock said with a sigh. “This thing should be a drink for women,\nnot for large Horneater men. At least he is not wine.”\nKaladin told her to bring whatever, barely paying attention. This place\nwas not inviting, really. It was loud, obnoxious, smoky, and smelly. It was\nalso alive. Laughing. Boasts and calls, mugs clanking. This… this was what\nsome people lived for. A day of honest labor, followed by an evening at the\ntavern with friends.\nThat was not so bad a life.\n“It’s loud tonight,” Sigzil noticed."

A day of honest labor, followed by an evening at the\ntavern with friends.\nThat was not so bad a life.\n“It’s loud tonight,” Sigzil noticed.\n“Is always loud,” Rock replied. “But tonight, maybe more.”\n“The army won a plateau run along with Bethab’s army,” Peet said.\nGood for them. Dalinar hadn’t gone, but Adolin had, along with three\nmen from Bridge Four. They hadn’t been required to go into battle, though\n—and any plateau run that didn’t endanger Kaladin’s men was a good one.\n“So many people is nice,” Rock said. “Makes tavern warmer. Is too cold\noutside.”\n“Too cold?” Moash said. “You’re from the storming Horneater Peaks!”\n“And?” Rock asked, frowning.\n“And those are mountains. It’s got to be colder up there than anything\ndown here.”\nRock actually sputtered, an amusing mixture of indignation and\nincredulity, bringing a red cast to his light Horneater skin. “Too much air!\nHard for you to think. Cold? Horneater Peaks is warm! Wonderfully warm.”\n“Really?” Kaladin asked, skeptical. This could be one of Rock’s jokes.\nSometimes, those didn’t make much sense to anyone but Rock himself.\n“It’s true,” Sigzil said. “The peaks have hot springs to warm them.”\n“Ah, but these are not springs,” Rock said, wagging a finger at Sigzil.\n“This is lowlander word. The Horneater oceans are waters of life.”\n“Oceans?” Peet asked, frowning.\n“Very small oceans,” Rock said. “One for every peak.”\n“The top of each mountain forms a kind of crater,” Sigzil explained,\n“which is filled with a large lake of warm water. The heat is enough to\ncreate a pocket of livable land, despite the altitude. Walk too far from one of\nthe Horneater towns, though, and you’ll end up in freezing temperatures\nand ice fields left by the highstorms.”\n“You are telling story wrong,” Rock said.\n“These are facts, not a story.”\n“Everything is story,” Rock said. “Listen. Long ago, the Unkalaki—my\npeople, ones you call Horneaters—did not live in peaks. They lived down\nwhere air was thick and thinking was difficult. But we were hated.”\n“Who would hate Horneaters?” Peet said.\n“Everyone,” Rock replied as Ka brought the drinks. More special\nattention. Most everyone else was having to go to the bar to pick up drinks.\nRock smiled at her and grabbed his large mug. “Is first drink. Lopen, you\nare trying to beat me?”\n“I’m at it, mancha,” Lopen said, raising his own mug, which was not\nquite so large.\nThe large Horneater took a pull on his drink, which left froth on his lip.\n“Everyone wanted to kill Horneaters,” he said, thumping his fist on the\ntable. “They were frightened of us. Stories say we were too good at\nfighting. So we were hunted and nearly destroyed.”\n“If you were so good at fighting,” Moash said, pointing, “then how\ncome you were nearly destroyed?”\n“There are few of us,” Rock said, hand proudly to his chest. “And very"

You are all over down here in lowlands. Man cannot step\nwithout finding toes of Alethi beneath his boot. So the Unkalaki, we were\nnearly destroyed. But our tana’kai—is like a king, but more—went to the\ngods to plead for help.”\n“Gods,” Kaladin said. “You mean spren.” He sought out Syl, who had\nchosen a perch on a rafter up above, watching a couple of little insects\nclimb on a post.\n“These are gods,” Rock said, following Kaladin’s gaze. “Yes. Some\ngods, though, they are more powerful than others. The tana’kai, he sought\nthe strongest among them. He went first to gods of the trees. ‘Can you hide\nus?’ he asked. But gods of the trees could not. ‘Men hunt us too,’ they said.\n‘If you hide here, they will find you, and will use you for wood just like\nthey use us.’”\n“Use Horneaters,” Sigzil said blandly, “as wood.”\n“Hush,” Rock replied. “Next, tana’kai, he visited gods of the waters.\n‘Can we live in your depths?’ he pled. ‘Give to us power to breathe as fish,\nand we will serve you beneath oceans.’ Alas, waters could not help. ‘Men\ndig into our hearts with hooks, and bring forth those we protect. If you were\nto live here, you would become their meals.’ So we could not live there.\n“Last, tana’kai—desperate—visited most powerful of gods, gods of the\nmountains. ‘My people are dying,’ he pled. ‘Please. Let us live on your\nslopes and worship you, and let your snows and ice provide our protection.’\n“Gods of the mountains thought long. ‘You cannot live upon our\nslopes,’ they said, ‘for is no life here. This is place of spirits, not of men.\nBut if you can find way to make him a place of men and of spirits, we will\nprotect you.’ And so, tana’kai returned to gods of the waters and said, ‘Give\nto us your water, that we may drink and live upon mountains.’ And he was\npromised. Tana’kai went to gods of the trees and said, ‘Give to us your fruit\nin bounty, that we may eat and live upon the mountains.’ And he was\npromised. Then, tana’kai returned to mountains, and said, ‘Give to us your\nheat, this thing that is in your heart, that we may live upon your peaks.’\n“And this thing, he pleased gods of mountains, who saw that Unkalaki\nwould work hard. They would not be burden upon the gods, but would\nsolve problems on their own. And so, gods of mountains withdrew their\npeaks into themselves, and made open place for waters of life. The oceans\nwere created of gods of the waters. Grass and fruit to give life were had of\npromise of gods of trees. And heat from heart of the mountains gave a place\nthat we may live.”"

And is truth.”\n“But you did call the lakes up there water,” Sigzil said. “So they’re hot\nsprings. Just like I said.”\n“Is different,” Rock replied, raising his hand and waving toward Ka,\nthen smiling very deeply and wagging his mug in a supplicating way.\n“How?”\n“Is not just water,” Rock said. “Is water of life. It is connection to gods.\nIf Unkalaki swim in it, sometimes they see place of gods.”\nKaladin leaned forward at that. His mind had been drifting toward how\nto help Bridge Eighteen with their discipline problems. This struck him.\n“Place of the gods?”\n“Yes,” Rock said. “Is where they live. The waters of life, they let you\nsee place. In it, you commune with gods, if you are lucky.”\n“Is that why you can see spren?” Kaladin asked. “Because you swam in\nthese waters, and they did something to you?”\n“Is not part of story,” Rock said as his second mug of ale arrived. He\ngrinned at Ka. “You are very wonderful woman. If you come to the Peaks, I\nwill make you family.”\n“Just pay your tab, Rock,” Ka said, rolling her eyes. As she moved off\nto collect some empty mugs, Peet jumped up to help her, surprising her by\ngathering some from another table.\n“You can see the spren,” Kaladin pressed, “because of what happened to\nyou in these waters.”\n“Is not part of story,” Rock said, eyeing him. “It is… involved. I will\nsay no more of this thing.”\n“I’d like to visit,” Lopen said. “Go for a dip myself.”\n“Ha! Is death to one not of our people,” Rock said. “I could not let you\nswim. Even if you beat me at drinking tonight.” He raised an eyebrow at\nLopen’s drink.\n“Swimming in the emerald pools is death to outsiders,” Sigzil said,\n“because you execute outsiders who touch them.”\n“No, this is not true. Listen to story. Stop being boring.”\n“They’re just hot springs,” Sigzil grumbled, but returned to his drink.\nRock rolled his eyes. “On top, is water. Beneath, is not. Is something\nelse. Water of life. The place of the gods. This thing is true. I have met a\ngod myself.”\n“A god like Syl?” Kaladin asked. “Or maybe a riverspren?” Those were\nsomewhat rare, but supposedly able to speak at times in simple ways, like\nwindspren.\n“No,” Rock said. He leaned in, as if saying something conspiratorial. “I\nsaw Lunu’anaki.”\n“Uh, great,” Moash said. “Wonderful.”"

He leaned in, as if saying something conspiratorial. “I\nsaw Lunu’anaki.”\n“Uh, great,” Moash said. “Wonderful.”\n“Lunu’anaki,” Rock said, “is god of travel and mischief. Very powerful\ngod. He came from depths of peak ocean, from realm of gods.”\n“What did he look like?” Lopen asked, eyes wide.\n“Like person,” Rock said. “Maybe Alethi, though skin was lighter. Very\nangular face. Handsome, perhaps. With white hair.”\nSigzil looked up sharply. “White hair?”\n“Yes,” Rock said. “Not grey, like old man, but white—yet he is young\nman. He spoke with me on shore. Ha! Made mockery of my beard. Asked\nwhat year it was, by Horneater calendar. Thought my name was funny. Very\npowerful god.”\n“Were you scared?” Lopen asked.\n“No, of course not. Lunu’anaki cannot hurt man. Is forbidden by other\ngods. Everyone knows this.” Rock downed the rest of his second mug and\nraised it to the air, grinning and wagging it toward Ka again as she passed.\nLopen hurriedly drank the rest of his first mug. Sigzil looked troubled,\nand had only touched half of his drink. He stared at it, though when Moash\nasked him what was wrong, Sigzil made an excuse about being tired.\nKaladin finally took a sip of his own drink. Lavis ale, sudsy, faintly\nsweet. It reminded him of home, though he’d only started drinking it once\nin the army.\nThe others moved on to a conversation about plateau runs. Sadeas had\napparently been disobeying orders to go on plateau runs in teams. He’d\ngone on one a bit back on his own, seizing the gemheart before anyone got\nthere, then tossing it away as if it was unimportant. Just a few days back,\nthough, Sadeas and Highprince Ruthar had gone on another run together—\none they weren’t supposed to go on. They claimed to have failed to get the\ngemheart, but it was open knowledge they’d won and hidden the winnings.\nThese overt slaps in Dalinar’s face were the buzz of the warcamps.\nMore so because Sadeas seemed outraged that he wasn’t being allowed to\nput investigators into Dalinar’s warcamp to search for “important facts” he\nsaid related to the safety of the king. It was all a game to him.\nSomeone needs to put Sadeas down, Kaladin thought, sipping his drink,\nswishing the cool liquid in his mouth. He’s as bad as Amaram—tried to get\nme and mine killed repeatedly. Don’t I have reason, even right, to return the\nfavor?\nKaladin was learning how to do what the assassin did—how to run up\nwalls, maybe reach windows that were thought inaccessible. He could visit\nSadeas’s camp in the night. Glowing, violent…\nKaladin could bring justice to this world.\nHis gut told him that there was something wrong with that reasoning,\nbut he had trouble producing it logically. He drank a little more, and looked\naround the room, noticing again how relaxed everyone seemed. This was\ntheir life. Work, then play. That was enough for them."

That was enough for them.\nNot for him. He needed something more. He got out a glowing sphere—\njust a diamond chip—and began to idly roll it on the table.\nAfter about an hour of conversation, Kaladin taking part only\nsporadically, Moash nudged him in the side. “You ready?” he whispered.\n“Ready?” Kaladin frowned.\n“Yeah. Meeting is in the back room. I saw them come in a bit ago.\nThey’ll be waiting.”\n“Who…” He trailed off, realizing what Moash intended. Kaladin had\nsaid he’d meet with Moash’s friends, the men who had tried to kill the king.\nKaladin’s skin went cold, the air suddenly seeming chill. “That’s why you\nwanted me to come tonight?”\n“Yeah,” Moash said. “I thought you’d figured it out. Come on.”\nKaladin looked down into his mug of yellow-brown liquid. Finally, he\ndowned the rest and stood up. He needed to know who these men were. His\nduty demanded it.\nMoash excused them, saying he’d noticed an old friend he wanted to\nintroduce to Kaladin. Rock, looking not the least bit drunk, laughed and\nwaved them on. He was on his… sixth drink? Seventh? Lopen was already\ntipsy after his third. Sigzil had only barely finished his second, and didn’t\nseem inclined to continue.\nSo much for the contest, Kaladin thought, letting Moash lead him. The\nplace was still busy, though not quite as packed as it had been earlier.\nTucked away in the back of the tavern was a hallway with private dining\nrooms, the type used by wealthy merchants who didn’t want to be subjected\nto the crudeness of the common room. A swarthy man lounged outside of\none. He might have been part Azish, or maybe just a very tan Alethi. He\ncarried very long knives at his belt, but didn’t say anything as Moash\npushed open the door.\n“Kaladin…” Syl’s voice. Where was she? Vanished, apparently, from\neven his eyes. Had she done that before? “Be careful.”\nHe stepped into the room with Moash. Three men and a woman drank\nwine at a table inside. Another guard stood at the back, wrapped in a cloak,\na sword at his waist and his head down, as if he were barely paying\nattention.\nTwo of the seated people, including the woman, were lighteyes. Kaladin\nshould have expected this, considering the fact that a Shardblade was\ninvolved, but it still gave him pause.\nThe lighteyed man stood up immediately. He was perhaps a little older\nthan Adolin, and he had jet-black Alethi hair, styled crisply. He wore an\nopen jacket and an expensive-looking black shirt underneath, embroidered\nwith white vines running between the buttons, and a stock at his throat.\n“So this is the famous Kaladin!” the man exclaimed, stepping forward\nand reaching out to clasp Kaladin’s hand. “Storms, but it is a pleasure to\nmeet you. Embarrassing Sadeas while saving the Blackthorn himself? Good\nshow, man. Good show.”"

Good show.”\n“And you are?” Kaladin asked.\n“A patriot,” the man said. “Call me Graves.”\n“And are you the Shardbearer?”\n“Straight to the point, are you?” Graves said, gesturing for Kaladin to sit\nat the table.\nMoash took a seat immediately, nodding to the other man at the table—\nhe was darkeyed, with short hair and sunken eyes. Mercenary, Kaladin\nguessed, noting the heavy leathers he was wearing and the axe beside his\nseat. Graves continued to gesture, but Kaladin delayed, inspecting the\nyoung woman at the table. She sat primly and sipped her cup of wine held\nin two hands, one covered in her buttoned sleeve. Pretty, with pursed red\nlips, she wore her hair up and stuck through with sundry metal decorations.\n“I recognize you,” Kaladin said. “One of Dalinar’s clerks.”\nShe watched him, careful, though she tried to appear relaxed.\n“Danlan is a member of the highprince’s retinue,” Graves said. “Please,\nKaladin. Sit. Have some wine.”\nKaladin sat down, but did not pour a drink. “You are trying to kill the\nking.”\n“He is direct, isn’t he?” Graves asked Moash.\n“Effective, too,” Moash said. “It’s why we like him.”\nGraves turned to Kaladin. “We are patriots, as I said before. Patriots of\nAlethkar. The Alethkar that could be.”\n“Patriots who wish to murder the kingdom’s ruler?”\nGraves leaned forward, clasping his hands on the table. A bit of the\nhumor left him, which was fine. He’d been trying too hard anyway. “Very\nwell, we shall be on with it. Elhokar is a supremely bad king. Surely you’ve\nnoticed this.”\n“It’s not my place to pass judgment on a king.”\n“Oh please,” Graves said. “You’re telling me you haven’t seen the way\nhe acts? Spoiled, petulant, paranoid. He squabbles instead of consulting, he\nmakes childish demands instead of leading. He is blowing this kingdom to\nthe ground.”\n“Have you any idea the kinds of policies he put into place before\nDalinar got him under control?” Danlan asked. “I spent the last three years\nin Kholinar helping the clerks there sort through the mess he made of the\nroyal codes. There was a time when he’d sign practically anything into law\nif he was cajoled the right way.”\n“He is incompetent,” said the darkeyed mercenary, whose name Kaladin\ndidn’t know. “He gets good men killed. Lets that bastard Sadeas get away\nwith high treason.”\n“So you try to assassinate him?” Kaladin demanded.\nGraves met Kaladin’s eyes. “Yes.”\n“If a king is destroying his country,” the mercenary said, “is it not the\nright—the duty—of the people to see him removed?”\n“If he were removed,” Moash said, “what would happen? Ask yourself\nthat, Kaladin.”"

Ask yourself\nthat, Kaladin.”\n“Dalinar would probably take the throne,” Kaladin said. Elhokar had a\nson back in Kholinar, a child, barely a few years old. Even if Dalinar only\nproclaimed himself regent in the name of the rightful heir, he would rule.\n“The kingdom would be far better off with him at the head,” Graves\nsaid.\n“He practically rules the place anyway,” Kaladin said.\n“No,” Danlan said. “Dalinar holds himself back. He knows he should\ntake the throne, but hesitates out of love for his dead brother. The other\nhighprinces interpret this as weakness.”\n“We need the Blackthorn,” Graves said, pounding the table. “This\nkingdom is going to fall otherwise. The death of Elhokar would spur\nDalinar to action. We would get back the man we had twenty years ago, the\nman who unified the highprinces in the first place.”\n“Even if that man didn’t fully return,” the mercenary added, “we\ncertainly couldn’t be worse off than we are now.”\n“So yes,” Graves said to Kaladin. “We’re assassins. Murderers, or\nwould-be ones. We don’t want a coup, and we don’t want to kill innocent\nguards. We just want the king removed. Quietly. Preferably in an accident.”\nDanlan grimaced, then took a drink of wine. “Unfortunately, we have\nnot been particularly effective so far.”\n“And that’s why I wanted to meet with you,” Graves said.\n“You expect me to help you?” Kaladin asked.\nGraves raised his hands. “Think about what we’ve said. That is all I ask.\nThink about the king’s actions, watch him. Ask yourself, ‘How much longer\nwill the kingdom last with this man at its head?’”\n“The Blackthorn must take the throne,” Danlan said softly. “It will\nhappen eventually. We want to help him along, for his own good. Spare him\nthe difficult decision.”\n“I could turn you in,” Kaladin said, meeting Graves’s eyes. To the side,\nthe cloaked man—who had been leaning against the wall and listening—\nshuffled, standing up straighter. “Inviting me here was a risk.”\n“Moash says you were trained as a surgeon,” Graves said, not looking at\nall concerned.\n“Yes.”\n“And what do you do if the hand is festering, threatening the entire\nbody? Do you wait and hope it gets better, or do you act?”\nKaladin didn’t reply.\n“You control the King’s Guard now, Kaladin,” Graves said. “We will\nneed an opening, a time when no guards will be hurt, to strike. We didn’t\nwant the actual blood of the king on our hands, wanted to make this seem\nan accident, but I have realized this is cowardly. I will do the deed myself.\nAll I want is an opening, and Alethkar’s suffering will be over.”\n“It will be better for the king this way,” Danlan said. “He is dying a\nslow death on that throne, like a drowning man far from land. Best to be\ndone with it quickly.”\nKaladin stood up. Moash rose hesitantly."

Moash rose hesitantly.\nGraves looked at Kaladin.\n“I will consider,” Kaladin said.\n“Good, good,” Graves said. “You can get back to us through Moash. Be\nthe surgeon this kingdom needs.”\n“Come on,” Kaladin said to Moash. “The others will be wondering\nwhere we got to.”\nHe walked out, Moash following after making a few hasty farewells.\nKaladin, honestly, expected one of them to try to stop him. Didn’t they\nworry that he’d turn them in, as he’d threatened?\nThey let him go. Back out into the clattering, chattering common room.\nStorms, he thought. I wish their arguments hadn’t been so good. “How\ndid you meet them?” Kaladin asked as Moash jogged up to join him.\n“Rill, that’s the fellow who was sitting at the table, he was a mercenary\non some of the caravans I worked before ending up in the bridge crews. He\ncame to me once we were free of slavery.” Moash took Kaladin by the arm,\nhalting him before they got back to their table. “They’re right. You know\nthey are, Kal. I can see it in you.”\n“They’re traitors,” Kaladin said. “I want nothing to do with them.”\n“You said you’d consider!”\n“I said that,” Kaladin said softly, “so that they’d let me leave. We have a\nduty, Moash.”\n“Is it greater than the duty to the country itself?”\n“You don’t care about the country,” Kaladin snapped. “You just want to\npursue your grudge.”\n“All right, fine. But Kaladin, did you notice? Graves treats all men the\nsame, regardless of eye color. He doesn’t care that we’re darkeyed. He\nmarried a darkeyed woman.”\n“Really?” Kaladin had heard of wealthy darkeyes marrying lowborn\nlighteyes, but never anyone as high-dahn as a Shardbearer.\n“Yeah,” Moash said. “One of his sons is even a one-eye. Graves doesn’t\ngive a storm about what other people think of him. He does what is right.\nAnd in this case, it’s—” Moash glanced around. They were now surrounded\nby people. “It’s what he said. Someone has to do it.”\n“Don’t speak of this to me again,” Kaladin said, pulling his arm free and\nwalking back toward the table. “And don’t meet with them anymore.”\nHe sat back down, Moash slinking into his place, annoyed. Kaladin\ntried to get himself to rejoin the conversation with Rock and Lopen, but he\njust couldn’t.\nAll around him, people laughed or shouted.\nBe the surgeon this kingdom needs…\nStorms, what a mess.\n47.

Sketching him had proven difficult, as whenever she\nlooked closely at a section of his form, she found that it had so much detail\nas to defy proper depiction.\n“Mmm?” Pattern asked in his humming voice.\nShallan climbed off her bed and tossed the book onto her white-painted\nwriting desk. She knelt beside Jasnah’s trunk, digging through it before\ncoming out with a map of Roshar. It was ancient, and not terribly accurate;\nAlethkar was depicted as far too large and the world as a whole was\nmisshapen, with trade routes emphasized. It clearly predated modern\nmethods of survey and cartography. Still, it was important, for it showed the\nSilver Kingdoms as they had supposedly existed during the time of the\nKnights Radiant.\n“Urithiru,” Shallan said, pointing toward a shining city depicted on the\nmap as the center of everything. It wasn’t in Alethkar, or Alethela as it had\nbeen known at the time. The map put it in the middle of the mountains near\nwhat might have been modern Jah Keved. However, Jasnah’s annotations\nsaid other maps from the time placed it elsewhere. “How could they not\nknow where their capital was, the center of the orders of knights? Why does\nevery map argue with its fellows?”\n“Mmmmmm…” Pattern said, thoughtful. “Perhaps many had heard of\nit, but never visited.”\n“Cartographers as well?” Shallan asked. “And the kings who\ncommissioned these maps? Surely some of them had been to the place. Why\non Roshar would it be so difficult to pinpoint?”\n“They wished to keep its location secret, perhaps?”\nShallan stuck the map to the wall using some weevilwax from Jasnah’s\nsupplies. She backed away, folding her arms. She hadn’t dressed for the day\nyet, and wore her dressing gown, hands uncovered.\n“If that’s the case,” Shallan said, “they did too good a job of it.” She\ndug out a few other maps from the time, created by other kingdoms. In\neach, Shallan noted, the country of origin was presented far larger than it\nshould have been. She stuck these to the wall too.\n“Each shows Urithiru in a different location,” Shallan said. “Notably\nclose to their own lands, yet not in their lands.”\n“Different languages on each,” Pattern said. “Mmm… There are\npatterns here.” He started to try sounding them out.\nShallan smiled. Jasnah had told her that several of them were thought to\nhave been written in the Dawnchant, a dead language. Scholars had been\ntrying for years to—\n“Behardan King… something I do not understand… order, perhaps…”\nPattern said. “Map? Yes, that would likely be map. So the next is perhaps to\ndraw… draw… something I do not understand…”\n“You’re reading it?”\n“It is a pattern.”\n“You’re reading the Dawnchant.”\n“Not well.”\n“You’re reading the Dawnchant!” Shallan exclaimed.

She scrambled up\nto the map beside which Pattern hovered, then rested her fingers on the\nscript at the bottom. “Behardan, you said? Maybe Bajerden… Nohadon\nhimself.”\n“Bajerden? Nohadon? Must people have so many names?”\n“One is honorific,” Shallan said. “His original name wasn’t considered\nsymmetrical enough. Well, I guess it wasn’t really symmetrical at all, so the\nardents gave him a new one centuries ago.”\n“But… the new one isn’t symmetrical either.”\n“The h sound can be for any letter,” Shallan said absently. “We write it\nas the symmetrical letter, to make the word balance, but add a diacritical\nmark to indicate it sounds like an h so the word is easier to say.”\n“That— One can’t just pretend that a word is symmetrical when it\nisn’t!”\nShallan ignored his sputtering, instead staring at the alien script of what\nwas supposedly the Dawnchant. If we do find Jasnah’s city, Shallan thought,\nand if it does have records, they might be in this language. “We need to see\nhow much of the Dawnchant you can translate.”\n“I did not read it,” Pattern said, annoyed. “I postulated a few words. The\nname I could translate because of the sounds of the cities above.”\n“But those aren’t written in the Dawnchant!”\n“The scripts are derived from one another,” Pattern said. “Obviously.”\n“So obvious that no human scholar has ever figured it out.”\n“You are not as good with patterns,” he said, sounding smug. “You are\nabstract. You think in lies and tell them to yourselves. That is fascinating,\nbut it is not good for patterns.”\nYou are abstract… Shallan rounded the bed and slipped a book from the\npile there, one written by the scholar Ali-daughter-Hasweth of Shinovar.\nThe Shin scholars were among the most interesting to read, as their\nperspectives on the rest of Roshar could be so frank, so different.\nShe found the passage she wanted. Jasnah had highlighted it in her\nnotes, so Shallan had sent out for the full book. Sebarial’s stipend to her—\nwhich he was paying—came in very handy. Vathah and Gaz, by her request,\nhad spent the last few days visiting book merchants asking after Words of\nRadiance, the book Jasnah had given her just before dying. So far no luck,\nthough one merchant had claimed he might be able to order it in from\nKholinar.\n“Urithiru was the connection to all nations,” she read from the Shin\nwriter’s work. “And, at times, our only path to the outside world, with its\nstones unhallowed.” She looked up at Pattern. “What does that mean to\nyou?”\n“It means what it says,” Pattern replied, still hovering beside the maps.\n“That Urithiru was well connected. Roads, perhaps?”\n“I’ve always read the phrase metaphorically. Connected in purpose, in\nthought, and scholarship.”\n“Ah. Lies.”\n“What if it’s not a metaphor? What if it’s like what you say?” She rose"

What if it’s like what you say?” She rose\nand crossed the room toward the maps, resting her fingers on Urithiru at the\ncenter. “Connected… but not by roads. Some of these maps don’t have any\nroads leading to Urithiru at all. They all place it in the mountains, or at least\nthe hills…”\n“Mmm.”\n“How do you reach a city if not by roads?” Shallan asked. “Nohadon\ncould walk there, or so he claimed. But others do not speak of riding, or\nwalking, to Urithiru.” True, there were few accounts of people visiting the\ncity. It was a legend. Most modern scholars considered it a myth.\nShe needed more information. She scrambled over to Jasnah’s trunk,\ndigging out one of her notebooks. “She said that Urithiru wasn’t on the\nShattered Plains,” Shallan said, “but what if the pathway to it is here? Not\nan ordinary pathway, though. Urithiru was the city of Surgebinders. Of\nancient wonders, like Shardblades.”\n“Mm…” Pattern said softly. “Shardblades are no wonder…”\nShallan found the reference she was searching for. It wasn’t the quote\nshe found curious, but Jasnah’s annotation of it. Another folktale, this one\nrecorded in Among the Darkeyed, by Calinam. Page 102. Stories of\ninstantaneous travel and the Oathgates pervade these tales.\nInstantaneous travel. Oathgates.\n“That’s what she was coming here for,” Shallan whispered. “She\nthought she could find a passageway here, on the Plains. But they’re barren\nstormlands, just stone, crem, and greatshells.” She looked up at Pattern.\n“We really need to get out there, onto the Shattered Plains.”\nHer announcement was accompanied by an ominous chime from the\nclock. Ominous in that it meant the hour was far later than she’d assumed.\nStorms! She needed to meet Adolin by noon. She had to leave in a half hour\nif she was going to meet him on time.\nShallan yelped and ran for the washroom. She turned the spigot for\nwater to fill the tub. After a moment of it spitting out dirty cremwater, clean,\nwarm water began to flow, and she put in the stopper. She put her hand\nunderneath it, marveling yet again. Flowing warm water. Sebarial said that\nartifabrians had visited recently, arranging to set up a fabrial that would\nkeep the water in the cistern above perpetually warm, like the ones in\nKharbranth.\n“I,” she said, shucking off her dressing gown, “am going to allow\nmyself to grow very, very accustomed to this.”\nShe climbed into the tub as Pattern moved along the wall above her. She\nhad decided not to be bashful around him. True, he had a male voice, but he\nwasn’t really a man. Besides, there were spren everywhere. The tub\nprobably had one in it, as did the walls.

She’d seen for herself that\neverything had a soul, or a spren, or whatever. Did she care if the walls\nwatched her? No. So why should she care about Pattern?\nShe did have to repeat this line of reasoning every time he saw her\nundress. It would help if he weren’t so blasted curious about everything.\n“The anatomical differences between genders are so slight,” Pattern\nsaid, humming to himself. “Yet so profound. And you augment them. Long\nhair. Blush on the cheeks. I went and watched Sebarial bathe last night and\n—”\n“Please tell me you didn’t,” Shallan said, blushing as she grabbed some\npasty soap from the jar beside the iron tub.\n“But… I just told you that I did… Anyway, I wasn’t seen. I would not\nneed to do this if you’d be more accommodating.”\n“I am not doing nude sketches for you.”\nShe had made the mistake of mentioning that many of the great artists\nhad trained themselves this way. After much pleading back home, she’d\ngotten several of the maids to pose for her, so long as she promised to\ndestroy the sketches. Which she had. She’d never sketched men that way.\nStorms, that would be embarrassing!\nShe didn’t let herself linger in the bath. A quarter hour later—by the\nclock—she stood dressed and combing her damp hair before the mirror.\nHow would she ever go back to Jah Keved and a placid, rural life again?\nThe answer was simple. She probably would never return. Once, that\nthought would have horrified her. Now it thrilled her—though she was\ndetermined to bring her brothers to the Shattered Plains. They would be far\nsafer here than at her father’s estates, and what would they be leaving\nbehind? Barely anything at all. She’d begun to think it was a far better\nsolution than anything else, and let them dodge the issue of the missing\nSoulcaster, to an extent.\nShe’d gone to one of the information stations connected to Tashikk—\nthere was one in every warcamp—and paid to have a letter, along with a\nspanreed, sent by messenger from Valath to her brothers. It would take\nweeks to arrive, unfortunately. If it even did. The merchant she’d talked to\nat the information station had warned her that moving through Jah Keved\nwas difficult these days, with the succession war. To be careful, she’d sent a\nsecond letter from Northgrip, which was as far from the battlefields as one\ncould get. Hopefully at least one of the two would arrive safely.\nWhen she established contact again, she’d make a single argument to\nher brothers. Abandon the Davar estates. Take the money Jasnah had sent\nand flee to the Shattered Plains. For now, she’d done what she could.\nShe rushed through the room, hopping on one foot as she pulled on a\nslipper, and passed the maps. I’ll deal with you later.\nIt was time to go woo her betrothed.

She buttoned up the sleeve over her safehand, then paused\nat the door as she looked back and saw her sketchbook and pencil lying on\nthe table.\nShe didn’t want to leave without those ever again. She tucked both in\nher satchel and rushed out. On the way through the white-marbled house,\nshe passed Palona and Sebarial in a room with enormous glass windows,\nfacing leeward over the gardens. Palona lay facedown, getting a massage—\ncompletely bare-backed—while Sebarial reclined and ate sweets. A young\nwoman stood at a lectern in the corner, reciting poetry to them.\nShallan had a difficult time judging those two. Sebarial. Was he a clever\ncivil planner or an indolent glutton? Both? Palona certainly did like the\nluxuries of wealth, but she didn’t seem the least bit arrogant. Shallan had\nspent the last three days poring over Sebarial’s house ledgers, and had\nfound them an absolute mess. He seemed so smart in some areas. How\ncould he have let his ledgers get so overgrown?\nShallan wasn’t especially good with numbers, not compared to her art,\nbut she did enjoy math on occasion and was determined to tackle those\nledgers.\nGaz and Vathah waited for her outside the doors. They followed her\ntoward Sebarial’s coach, which waited for her to use, along with one of her\nslaves to act as footman. En said he’d done the job before, and he smiled at\nher as she stepped up. That was good to see. She couldn’t remember any of\nthe five smiling on their trip out, even when she’d released them from the\ncage.\n“You are being treated well, En?” she asked as he opened the coach\ndoor for her.\n“Yes, mistress.”\n“You’d tell me if you weren’t?”\n“Er, yes, mistress.”\n“And you, Vathah?” she asked, turning to him. “How are you finding\nyour accommodations?”\nHe grunted.\n“I assume that means they’re accommodating?” she asked.\nGaz chuckled. The short man had an ear for wordplay.\n“You’ve kept your bargain,” Vathah said. “I’ll give you that. The men\nare happy.”\n“And you?”\n“Bored. All we do every day is sit around, collect what you pay us, and\ngo drinking.”\n“Most men would consider that an ideal profession.” She smiled at En,\nthen climbed into the coach.\nVathah shut the door for her, then looked in the window. “Most men are\nidiots.”\n“Nonsense,” Shallan said, smiling. “By the law of averages, only half of\nthem are.”\nHe grunted. She was learning to interpret those, which was essential to\nspeaking Vathahese. This one roughly meant, “I’m not going to\nacknowledge that joke because it would spoil my reputation as a complete\nand utter dunnard.”\n“I suppose,” he said, “we have to ride up top.”\n“Thank you for offering,” Shallan said, then pulled down the window\nshade.

The two climbed into the guard\npositions on the top back of the carriage, and En joined the coachman up\nfront. It was a true proper coach, pulled by horses and everything. Shallan\nhad originally felt bad about asking to use it, but Palona had laughed. “Take\nthe thing whenever you want! I have my own, and if Turi’s coach is gone,\nhe’ll have an excuse to not go when people ask him to visit. He loves that.”\nShallan closed the other window shade as the coachman started the\nvehicle rolling, then got out her sketchbook. Pattern waited on the first\nblank white page. “We are going to find out,” Shallan whispered, “just what\nwe can do.”\n“Exciting!” Pattern said.\nShe got out her pouch of spheres and breathed in some of the\nStormlight. Then, she puffed it out in front of her, trying to shape it, meld it.\nNothing.\nNext, she tried holding a very specific image in her head—herself, with\none small change: black hair instead of red. She puffed out the Stormlight,\nand this time it shifted around her and hung for a moment. Then it too\nvanished.\n“This is silly,” Shallan said softly, Stormlight trailing from her lips. She\ndid a quick sketch of herself with dark hair. “What does it matter if I draw it\nfirst or not? The pencils don’t even show color.”\n“It shouldn’t matter,” Pattern said. “But it matters to you. I do not know\nwhy.”\nShe finished the sketch. It was very simple—it didn’t show her features,\nonly really her hair, everything else indistinct. Yet when she used\nStormlight this time, the image took and her hair darkened to black.\nShallan sighed, Stormlight leaking from her lips. “So, how do I make\nthe illusion vanish?”\n“Stop feeding it.”\n“How?”\n“I am supposed to know this?” Pattern asked. “You are the expert on\nfeeding.”\nShallan gathered all of her spheres—several were now dun—and set\nthem on the seat across from her, out of reach. That wasn’t far enough, for\nas her Stormlight ran out, she breathed in using instincts she hadn’t realized\nshe had. Light streamed from across the carriage and into her.\n“I’m quite good at that,” Shallan said sourly, “considering how short a\ntime I’ve been doing it.”\n“Short time?” Pattern said. “But we first…”\nShe stopped listening until he was done.\n“I really need to find another copy of Words of Radiance,” Shallan said,\nstarting another sketch. “Maybe it talks about how to dismiss the illusions.”\nShe continued to work on her next sketch, a picture of Sebarial. She’d\ntaken a Memory of him while dining the night before, just after returning\nfrom a session scouting Amaram’s compound. She wanted to get the details\nof this sketch right for her collection, so it took some time. Fortunately, the\nlevel roadway meant no big bumps.

Folds in skin, individual hairs.\nShe hadn’t drawn those—no sketch could capture all the hairs on a head, all\nthe pores in skin. Her image had these things, so it didn’t create exactly\nwhat she drew, but the drawing was a focus. A model that the image built\nfrom.\n“Mmm,” Pattern said, sounding satisfied. “One of your most truthful\nlies. Wonderful.”\n“He doesn’t move,” Shallan said. “Nobody would mistake this for\nsomething living, never mind the unnatural pose. The eyes are lifeless; the\nchest doesn’t rise and fall with breath. The muscles don’t shift. It’s detailed\n—but like a statue can be detailed yet still dead.”\n“A statue of light.”\n“I didn’t say it isn’t impressive,” Shallan said. “But the images will be\nmuch harder to use unless I can give them life.” How strange that she\nshould feel that her sketches were alive, but this thing—which was so much\nmore realistic—was dead.\nShe reached out to wave her hand through the image. If she touched it\nslowly, the disturbance was minor. Waving her hand disturbed it like smoke.\nShe noticed something else. While her hand was in the image…\nYes. She sucked in a breath and the image dissolved to glowing smoke,\ndrawn into her skin. She could reclaim Stormlight from the illusion. One\nquestion answered, she thought, settling back and making notes about the\nexperience in the back of the notebook.\nShe began packing up her satchel as the carriage arrived at the Outer\nMarket, where Adolin would be waiting for her. They’d gone on their\npromised walk the day before, and she felt things were going well. But she\nalso knew she needed to impress him. Her efforts with Highlady Navani\nhad not been fruitful so far, and she really did need an alliance with the\nKholin house.\nThat made her consider. Her hair had dried, but she tended to keep it\nlong and straight down her back, with only its natural curl to give it body.\nThe Alethi women favored intricate braids instead.\nHer skin was pale and dusted lightly with freckles, and her body was\nnowhere near curvaceous enough to inspire envy.

She could change all of\nthis with an illusion. An augmentation. Since Adolin had seen her without,\nshe couldn’t change anything dramatic—but she could enhance herself. It\nwould be like wearing makeup.\nShe hesitated. If Adolin came to agree to the marriage, would it be\nbecause of her, or the lies?\nFoolish girl, Shallan thought. You were willing to change your\nappearance to get Vathah to follow you and to gain a place with Sebarial,\nbut not now?\nBut capturing Adolin’s attention with illusions would lead her down a\ndifficult path. She couldn’t wear an illusion always, could she? In married\nlife? Better to see what she could do without one, she thought as she\nclimbed out of the carriage. She’d have to rely, instead, upon her feminine\nwiles.\nShe wished she knew if she had any.\n48. No More Weakness\nTHREE YEARS AGO\n“These are really good, Shallan,” Balat said, leafing through pages of\nher sketches. The two of them sat in the gardens, accompanied by Wikim,\nwho sat on the ground tossing a cloth-wrapped ball for his axehound Sakisa\nto catch.\n“My anatomy is off,” Shallan said with a blush. “I can’t get the\nproportions right.” She needed models to pose for her so she could work on\nthat.\n“You’re better than Mother ever was,” Balat said, flipping to another\npage, where she had sketched Balat on the sparring grounds with his\nswordsmanship tutor. He tipped it toward Wikim, who raised an eyebrow.\nHer middle brother was looking better and better these last four months.\nLess scrawny, more solid. He almost constantly had mathematical problems\nwith him. Father had once railed at him for that, claiming it was feminine\nand unseemly—but, in a rare show of dissension, Father’s ardents had\napproached him and told him to calm himself, and that the Almighty\napproved of Wikim’s interest. They hoped Wikim might find his way into\ntheir ranks.\n“I heard that you got another letter from Eylita,” Shallan said, trying to\ndistract Balat from the sketchbook. She couldn’t keep herself from blushing\nas he turned page after page. Those weren’t meant for others to look at.\nThey weren’t any good.\n“Yeah,” he said, grinning.\n“You going to have Shallan read it to you?” Wikim asked, throwing the\nball.\nBalat coughed. “I had Malise do it. Shallan was busy.”\n“You’re embarrassed!” Wikim said, pointing. “What is in those letters?”\n“Things my fourteen-year-old sister doesn’t need to know about!” Balat\nsaid.\n“That racy, eh?” Wikim asked. “I wouldn’t have figured that for the\nTavinar girl. She seems too proper.”\n“No!” Balat blushed further. “They aren’t racy; they are merely\nprivate.”\n“Private like your—”\n“Wikim,” Shallan cut in.\nHe looked up, and then noticed that angerspren were pooling"

You are getting so touchy about that\ngirl.”\n“Love makes us all fools,” Shallan said, distracting the two.\n“Love?” Balat asked, glancing at her. “Shallan, you’re barely old\nenough to pin up your safehand. What do you know about love?”\nShe blushed. “I… never mind.”\n“Oh, look at that,” Wikim said. “She’s thought up something clever.\nYou’re going to have to say it now, Shallan.”\n“No use keeping something like that inside,” Balat agreed.\n“Ministara says I speak my mind too much. That it’s not a feminine\nattribute.”\nWikim laughed. “That hasn’t seemed to stop any women I’ve known.”\n“Yeah, Shallan,” Balat said. “If you can’t say the things you think of to\nus, then who can you say them to?”\n“Trees,” she said, “rocks, shrubs. Basically anything that can’t get me in\ntrouble with my tutors.”\n“You don’t have to worry about Balat, then,” Wikim said. “He couldn’t\nmanage something clever even in repetition.”\n“Hey!” Balat said. Though, unfortunately, it wasn’t far from the truth.\n“Love,” Shallan said, though partially just to distract them, “is like a\npile of chull dung.”\n“Smelly?” Balat asked.\n“No,” Shallan said, “for even as we try to avoid both, we end up\nstepping in them anyway.”\n“Deep words for a girl who hit her teens precisely fifteen months ago,”\nWikim said with a chuckle.\n“Love is like the sun,” Balat said, sighing.\n“Blinding?” Shallan asked. “White, warm, powerful—but also capable\nof burning you?”\n“Perhaps,” Balat said, nodding.\n“Love is like a Herdazian surgeon,” Wikim said, looking at her.\n“And how is that?” Shallan asked.\n“You tell me,” Wikim said. “I’m seeing what you can make of it.”\n“Um… Both leave you uncomfortable?” Shallan said. “No. Ooh! The\nonly reason you’d want one was if you’d taken a sharp blow to the head!”\n“Ha! Love is like spoiled food.”\n“Necessary for life on one hand,” Shallan said, “but also expressly\nnauseating.”\n“Father’s snoring.”\nShe shuddered. “You have to experience it to believe just how\ndistracting it can be.”\nWikim chuckled. Storms, but it was good to see him doing that.\n“Stop it, you two,” Balat said. “That kind of talk is disrespectful.\nLove… love is like a classical melody.”\nShallan grinned. “If you end your performance too quickly, your\naudience is disappointed?”\n“Shallan!” Balat said.\nWikim, however, was rolling on the ground. After a moment, Balat\nshook his head, and gave an agreeable chuckle. For her own part, Shallan"

Did I really just say that? That last one had actually been\nsomewhat witty, far better than the others. It had also been improper.\nShe got a guilty thrill from it. Balat looked embarrassed, and he blushed\nat the double meaning, collecting shamespren. Sturdy Balat. He wanted so\nmuch to lead them. So far as she knew, he’d given up his habit of killing\ncremlings for fun. Being in love strengthened him, changed him.\nThe sound of wheels on stone announced a carriage arriving at the\nhouse. No hoofbeats—father owned horses, but few other people in the area\ndid. Their carriages were pulled by chulls or parshmen.\nBalat rose to go see who had come, and Sakisa followed after, trumping\nin excitement. Shallan picked up her sketchpad. Father had recently\nforbidden her from drawing the manor’s parshmen or darkeyes—he found it\nunseemly. That made it hard for her to find practice figures.\n“Shallan?”\nShe started, realizing that Wikim hadn’t followed Balat. “Yes.”\n“I was wrong,” Wikim said, handing her something. A small pouch.\n“About what you’re doing. I see through it. And… and still it’s working.\nDamnation, but it’s working. Thank you.”\nShe moved to open the pouch he’d given her.\n“Don’t,” he said.\n“What is it?”\n“Blackbane,” Wikim said. “A plant, the leaves at least. If you eat them,\nthey paralyze you. Your breathing stops too.”\nDisturbed, she pulled the top tight. She didn’t even want to know how\nWikim could recognize a deadly plant like this.\n“I’ve carried those for the better part of a year,” Wikim said softly. “The\nlonger you have them, the more potent the leaves are supposed to become. I\ndon’t feel like I need them any longer. You can burn them, or whatever. I\njust thought you should have them.”\nShe smiled, though she felt unsettled. Wikim had been carrying this\npoison around? He felt he needed to give it to her?\nHe jogged after Balat, and Shallan stuffed the pouch in her satchel.\nShe’d find a way to destroy it later. She picked up her pencils and went\nback to drawing.\nShouting from inside the manor distracted her a short time later. She\nlooked up, uncertain even how much time had passed. She rose, satchel\nclutched to her chest, and crossed the yard. Vines shook and withdrew\nbefore her, though as her pace sped up, she stepped on more and more of\nthem, feeling them writhe beneath her feet and try to yank back. Cultivated\nvines had poor instincts.\nShe reached the house to more shouting.\n“Father!” Asha Jushu’s voice. “Father, please!”\nShallan pushed open the slatted wood doors, silk dress rustling against\nthe floor as she stepped in and found three men in old-style clothing—"

Over the years,\nJushu had grown plump from his periods of excess.\n“Bah,” Father said. “I will not suffer this extortion.”\n“His credit is your credit, Brightlord,” one of the men said in a calm,\nsmooth voice. He was darkeyed, though he didn’t sound it. “He promised us\nyou would pay his debts.”\n“He lied,” Father said, Ekel and Jix—house guards—at his sides, hands\non weapons.\n“Father,” Jushu whispered through his tears. “They’ll take me—”\n“You were supposed to be riding our outer holdings!” Father bellowed.\n“You were supposed to be checking on our lands, not dining with thieves\nand gambling away our wealth and our good name!”\nJushu hung his head, sagging in his bonds.\n“He’s yours,” Father said, turning and storming from the chamber.\nShallan gasped as one of the men sighed, then gestured toward Jushu.\nThe other two grabbed him. They didn’t seem pleased to be leaving without\npayment. Jushu trembled as they towed him away, past Balat and Wikim,\nwho watched nearby. Outside, Jushu cried for mercy and begged the men to\nlet him speak to Father again.\n“Balat,” Shallan said, walking to him, taking his arm. “Do something!”\n“We all knew where the gambling would take him,” Balat said. “We\ntold him, Shallan. He wouldn’t listen.”\n“He’s still our brother!”\n“What do you expect me to do? Where would I get spheres enough to\npay his debt?”\nJushu’s weeping grew softer as the men left the manor.\nShallan turned and dashed after her father, passing Jix scratching his\nhead. Father had gone into his study two rooms over; she hesitated in the\ndoorway, looking in at her father slumped in his chair beside the hearth. She\nstepped in, passing the desk where his ardents—and sometimes his wife—\ntallied his ledgers and read him reports.\nNobody stood there now, but the ledgers were open, displaying a brutal\ntruth. She raised a hand to her mouth, noticing several letters of debt. She’d\nhelped with minor accounts, but never seen so much of the full picture, and\nwas stunned by what she saw. How could the family owe that much money?\n“I’m not going to change my mind, Shallan,” Father said. “Leave. Jushu\nprepared this pyre himself.”\n“But—”\n“Leave me!” Father roared, standing.\nShallan cringed back, eyes widening, heart nearly stopping. Fearspren\nwriggled up around her. He never yelled at her. Never.\nFather took a deep breath, then turned to the room’s window. His back\nto her, he continued, “I can’t afford the spheres.”"

His back\nto her, he continued, “I can’t afford the spheres.”\n“Why?” Shallan asked. “Father, is this because of the deal with\nBrightlord Revilar?” She looked at the ledgers. “No, it’s bigger than that.”\n“I will finally make something of myself,” Father said, “and of this\nhouse. I will stop them from whispering about us; I will end the\nquestioning. House Davar will become a force in this princedom.”\n“By bribing favor from supposed allies?” Shallan asked. “Using money\nwe don’t have?”\nHe looked at her, face shadowed but eyes reflecting light, like twin\nembers in the dark of his skull. In that moment, Shallan felt a terrifying\nhatred from her father. He strode over, grabbing her by the arms. Her\nsatchel dropped to the floor.\n“I’ve done this for you,” he growled, holding her arms in a tight, painful\ngrip. “And you will obey. I’ve gone wrong, somewhere, in letting you learn\nto question me.”\nShe whimpered at the pain.\n“There will be changes in this house,” Father said. “No more weakness.\nI’ve found a way…”\n“Please, stop.”\nHe looked down at her and seemed to see the tears in her eyes for the\nfirst time.\n“Father…” she whispered.\nHe looked upward. Toward his rooms. She knew he was looking toward\nMother’s soul. He dropped her then, causing her to tumble to the floor, red\nhair covering her face.\n“You are confined to your rooms,” he snapped. “Go, and do not leave\nuntil I give you permission.”\nShallan scrambled to her feet, snatching her satchel, then left the room.\nIn the hallway, she pressed her back against the wall, panting raggedly, tears\ndripping from her chin. Things had been going better… her father had been\nbetter…\nShe squeezed her eyes shut. Emotion stormed inside of her, twisting\nabout. She couldn’t control it.\nJushu.\nFather actually looked like he wanted to hurt me, Shallan thought,\nshivering. He’s changed so much. She started to sink down toward the floor,\narms wrapped around herself.\nJushu.\nKeep cutting at those thorns, strong one… Make a path for the light…\nShallan forced herself to her feet. She ran, still crying, back into the\nfeast hall. Balat and Wikim had taken seats, Minara quietly serving them\ndrinks. The guards had left, perhaps to their post at the manor grounds.\nWhen Balat saw Shallan, he stood, eyes widening. He rushed to her,\nknocking over his cup in his haste, spilling wine to the floor.\n“Did he hurt you?” Balat asked. “Damnation! I’ll kill him! I’ll go to the\nhighprince and—”\n“He didn’t hurt me,” Shallan said. “Please. Balat, your knife. The one\nFather gave you.”\nHe looked to his belt. “What of it?”\n“It’s worth good money.

I’m going to try to trade it for Jushu.”\nBalat lowered his hand protectively to the knife. “Jushu built his pyre\nhimself, Shallan.”\n“That’s exactly what Father said to me,” Shallan replied, wiping her\neyes, then meeting those of her brother.\n“I…” Balat looked over his shoulder in the direction Jushu had been\ntaken. He sighed, then unhooked the sheath from his belt and handed it to\nher. “It won’t be enough. They say he owes almost a hundred emerald\nbroams.”\n“I have my necklace too,” Shallan said.\nWikim, silently drinking his wine, reached to his belt and took off his\nknife. He set it at the edge of the table. Shallan scooped it up as she passed,\nthen ran from the room. Could she catch the men in time?\nOutside, she spotted the carriage only a short way down the road. She\nhurried as best she could on slippered feet down the cobbled drive and out\nthe gates onto the road. She wasn’t fast, but neither were chulls. As she\ndrew closer, she saw that Jushu had been tied to walk behind the carriage.\nHe didn’t look up as Shallan passed him.\nThe carriage stopped, and Jushu dropped to the ground and curled up.\nThe darkeyed man with the haughty air pushed open his door to look at\nShallan. “He sent the child?”\n“I came on my own,” she said, holding up the daggers. “Please, they are\nvery fine work.”\nThe man raised an eyebrow, then gestured for one of his companions to\nstep down and fetch them. Shallan unhooked her necklace and dropped it\ninto the man’s hands with the two knives. The man took out one of the\nknives, inspecting it as Shallan waited, apprehensive, shifting from foot to\nfoot.\n“You’ve been weeping,” said the man in the carriage. “You care for him\nthat much?”\n“He is my brother.”\n“So?” the man asked. “I killed my brother when he tried to cheat me.\nYou shouldn’t let relations cloud your eyes.”\n“I love him,” Shallan whispered.\nThe man looking over the daggers slid them both back in their sheaths.\n“They are masterworks,” he admitted. “I’d value them at twenty emerald\nbroams.”\n“The necklace?” Shallan asked.\n“Simple, but of aluminum, which can only be made by Soulcasting,” the\nman said to his boss. “Ten emerald.”\n“Together half what your brother owes,” said the man in the carriage.\nShallan’s heart sank. “But… what would you do with him? Selling him\nas a slave cannot redeem so great a debt.”\n“I’m often in the mood to remind myself that lighteyes bleed the same\nas darkeyes,” the man said. “And sometimes it is useful to have a deterrent\nfor others, a way to remind them not to take loans they cannot repay. He\nmay save me more than he cost, if I display him prudently.”\nShallan felt small. She clasped her hands, one covered, one not. Had she\nlost, then?

The women from Father’s books, the women she was coming to\nadmire, would not have made pleas to win this man’s heart. They would\nhave tried logic.\nShe wasn’t good at that. She didn’t have the training for it, and she\ncertainly didn’t currently have the temperament. But as the tears began\nagain, she forced out the first thing that came to mind.\n“He may save you money that way,” Shallan said. “But he may not. It is\na gamble, and you do not strike me as the kind of man who gambles.”\nThe man laughed. “What makes you say that? Gambling is what\nbrought me here!”\n“No,” she said, blushing at her tears. “You are the type of man who\nprofits from the gambling of others. You know that it usually leads to loss. I\ngive you items of real value. Take them. Please?”\nThe man considered. He held out his hands for the daggers, and his man\npassed them over. He unsheathed one of the daggers and inspected it.\n“Name for me one reason I should show this man pity. In my house, he was\nan arrogant glutton, acting without thought for the difficulty he would cause\nyou, his family.”\n“Our mother was murdered,” Shallan said. “That night, as I cried, Jushu\nheld me.” It was all she had.\nThe man considered.

The man then\nclimbed onto the back of the vehicle and knocked. It pulled away.\nShallan knelt beside Jushu. He blinked one eye—the other was bruised\nand beginning to swell shut—as she untied his bloodied hands. It had not\nbeen a quarter hour since Father had declared that the men could have him,\nbut they had obviously taken that time to show Jushu what they thought of\nnot being paid.\n“Shallan?” he asked, lips bloodied. “What happened?”\n“You weren’t listening?”\n“My ears ring,” he said. “Everything is spinning.

The\nperspective was eastward, toward the Origin. What an unnatural\narrangement; it made her feel exposed. Shallan was accustomed to\nbalconies, gardens, and patios all facing away from the storms.

She let\nthe servant lead her among the tables, sending her guards for the day off\ntoward a larger room cut farther into the stone to the right. This one had a\nproper roof and walls, so it could be completely closed off, and a group of\nother guards waited here upon the whims of their masters.\nShallan drew the eyes of the other patrons. Well, good. She had come\nhere to upset their world. The more people spoke of her, the better her\nchances of persuading them, when the time came, to listen to her regarding\nthe parshmen. Those were everywhere in camp, even here in this luxurious\nwinehouse. She spotted three in the corner, moving wine bottles from wall-\nmounted racks to crates. They moved at a plodding yet implacable pace.\nA few more steps brought her to the marble balustrade right at the edge\nof the terrace. Here Adolin had a table set off by itself with an unobstructed\nview directly east. Two members of Dalinar’s house guard stood by the wall\na short distance away; Adolin was important enough, apparently, that his\nguards didn’t need to wait with the others.\nAdolin browsed a folio, oversized by design so it wouldn’t be mistaken\nfor a woman’s book. Shallan had seen some folios containing battle maps,\nothers with designs for armor or pictures of architecture. She was amused as\nshe caught sight of the glyphs for this one, with women’s script underneath\nfor further clarification. Fashions out of Liafor and Azir.\nAdolin looked as handsome as he had before. Maybe more so, now that\nhe was obviously more relaxed. She would not let him muddle her mind.\nShe had a purpose to this meeting: an alliance with House Kholin to help\nher brothers and give her resources for exposing the Voidbringers and\ndiscovering Urithiru.\nShe couldn’t afford to come off as weak. She had to control the\nsituation, could not act like a sycophant, and she couldn’t—\nAdolin saw her and closed the portfolio. He stood up, grinning.\n—oh, storms. That smile.\n“Brightness Shallan,” he said, holding out a hand toward her. “You are\nsettling well in Sebarial’s camp?”\n“Yeah,” she said, grinning at him. That mop of unruly hair just made her\nwant to reach out and run her fingers through it. Our children would have\nthe strangest hair ever, she thought. His gold and black Alethi locks, my red\nones, and…\nAnd was she really thinking about their children? Already? Foolish girl.\n“Yes,” she continued, trying to de-melt a little. “He has been quite kind\nto me.”\n“It’s probably because you’re family,” Adolin said, letting her sit, then\npushing in her chair. He did it himself, rather than allowing the master-\nservant to do so. She would not have expected that of someone so highborn.\n“Sebarial only does what he feels he’s forced to.”\n“I think he may surprise you,” Shallan said.\n“Oh, he’s already done that on several occasions.”\n“Really? When?”\n“Well,” Adolin said, sitting, “he once produced a very, um, loud and"

When?”\n“Well,” Adolin said, sitting, “he once produced a very, um, loud and\ninappropriate noise at a meeting with the king…” Adolin smiled, shrugging\nas if embarrassed, but he didn’t blush as Shallan might have in a similar\nsituation. “Does that count?”\n“I’m not sure. Knowing what I do of Uncle Sebarial, I doubt that such a\nthing is particularly surprising from him. Expected is more like it.”\nAdolin laughed, tossing his head back. “Yes, I suppose you’re right.\nThat you are.”\nHe seemed so confident. Not in a particularly conceited way, not like\nher father had been. In fact, it occurred to her that her father’s attitude had\nbeen caused not by confidence, but the opposite.\nAdolin seemed perfectly at ease both with his station and those around\nhim. When he waved for the master-servant to bring him a list of wines, he\nsmiled at the woman, though she was darkeyed. That smile was enough to\nproduce a blush even in a master-servant.\nShallan was supposed to get this man to court her? Storms! She’d felt\nfar more capable when trying to scam the leader of the Ghostbloods. Act\nrefined, Shallan told herself. Adolin has moved with the elite, and has been\nin relationships with the most sophisticated ladies of the world. He will\nexpect that from you.\n“So,” he said, flipping through the list of wines, described by glyphs,\n“we are supposed to get married.”\n“I would lighten that phrasing, Brightlord,” Shallan said, choosing her\nwords carefully. “We aren’t supposed to get married. Your cousin Jasnah\nmerely wanted us to consider a union, and your aunt seemed to agree.”\n“The Almighty save a man when his female relatives collude about his\nfuture,” Adolin said with a sigh. “Sure, it’s all right for Jasnah to run about\ninto her middle years without a spouse, but if I reach my twenty-third\nbirthday without a bride, it’s like I’m some kind of menace. Sexist of her,\ndon’t you think?”\n“Well, she wanted me to get married too,” Shallan said. “So I wouldn’t\ncall her sexist. Merely… Jasnah-ist?” She paused. “Jasnagynistic? No, drat.\nIt would have to be Misjasnahistic, and that doesn’t work nearly as well,\ndoes it?”\n“You’re asking me?” Adolin asked, turning around the menu so she\ncould see it. “What do you think we should order?”\n“Storms,” she breathed. “Those are all different kinds of wine?”\n“Yeah,” Adolin said. He leaned toward her, as if conspiratorial.\n“Honestly, I don’t pay a lot of attention. Renarin knows the difference\nbetween them—he’ll drone on if you let him. Me, I order something that\nsounds important, but I’m really just choosing based on color.” He\ngrimaced. “We’re technically at war. I won’t be able to take anything too\nintoxicating, just in case. Kind of silly, as there won’t be any plateau runs\ntoday.”\n“You’re sure? I thought they were random.”"

They almost never come too close\nbefore a highstorm, anyway.” He leaned back, scanning the menu, before\npointing at one of the wines and winking at the serving woman.\nShallan felt cold. “Wait. Highstorm?”\n“Yeah,” Adolin said, checking the clock in the corner. Sebarial had\nmentioned that those were growing more and more common around here.\n“Should come any time now. You didn’t know?”\nShe sputtered, looking eastward, across the cracked landscape. Act\npoised! she thought. Elegant! Instead, a primal part of her wanted to\nscramble for a hole and hide. Suddenly she imagined she could sense the\npressure dropping, as if the air itself were trying to escape. Could she see it\nout there, starting? No, that was nothing. She squinted anyway.\n“I didn’t look at the list of storms Sebarial keeps,” Shallan forced\nherself to say. In all honesty, it was probably outdated, knowing him. “I’ve\nbeen busy.”\n“Huh,” Adolin said. “I wondered why you didn’t ask about this place. I\njust assumed you’d heard of it already.”\nThis place. The open balcony, facing east. The lighteyes drinking wine\nnow seemed anticipatory to her, with an air of nervousness. The second\nroom—the large one for bodyguards she’d seen with the substantial doors—\nmade far more sense now.\n“We’re here to watch?” Shallan whispered.\n“It’s the new fad,” Adolin said. “Apparently we’re supposed to sit here\nuntil the storm is almost upon us, then run into that other room and take\nshelter. I’ve wanted to come for weeks now, and only just managed to\nconvince my minders that I’d be safe here.” He said that last part somewhat\nbitterly. “We can go move into the safe room now, if you want.”\n“No,” Shallan said, forcing herself to pry her fingers from the table\nedge. “I’m fine.”\n“You look pale.”\n“It’s natural.”\n“Because you’re Veden?”\n“Because I’m always at the edge of panic these days. Oh, is that our\nwine?”\nPoised, she reminded herself yet again. She pointedly did not look\neastward.\nThe servant had brought them two cups of brilliant blue wine. Adolin\npicked his up and studied it. He smelled it, sipped it, then nodded in\nsatisfaction and dismissed the servant with a parting smile. He watched the\nwoman’s backside as she retreated.\nShallan raised an eyebrow at him, but he didn’t seem to notice that he’d\ndone anything wrong. He looked back at Shallan and leaned in again. “I\nknow you’re supposed to swish the wine about and taste it and things,” he\nwhispered, “but nobody has ever explained to me what I’m looking for.”\n“Bugs floating in the liquid, perhaps?”\n“Nah, my new food taster would have spotted one of those.” He smiled,\nbut Shallan realized he probably wasn’t joking.

A thin man who didn’t wear\na uniform had walked over to chat with the bodyguards. Probably the food\ntaster.\nShallan sipped her wine. It was good—slightly sweet, a tad spicy. Not\nthat she could spare much thought for its taste, with that storm—\nStop it, she told herself, smiling at Adolin. She needed to make sure this\nmeeting went well for him. Get him to talk about himself. That was one\npiece of advice she remembered from books.\n“Plateau runs,” Shallan said. “How do you know when to begin one,\nanyway?”\n“Hmm? Oh, we have spotters,” Adolin said, lounging back in his chair.\n“Men who stand atop towers with these enormous spyglasses. They inspect\nevery plateau we can reach in a reasonable time, watching for a chrysalis.”\n“I hear you’ve captured your share of those.”\n“Well, I probably shouldn’t talk about it. Father doesn’t want it to be a\ncompetition anymore.” He looked at her, expectant.\n“But surely you can talk about what happened before,” Shallan said,\nfeeling as if she were filling an expected role.\n“I suppose,” Adolin said. “There was one run a few months back where\nI seized the chrysalis basically by myself. You see, Father and I, we would\nusually jump the chasm first and clear the way for the bridges.”\n“Isn’t that dangerous?” Shallan asked, dutifully looking at him with\nwidened eyes.\n“Yes, but we’re Shardbearers. We have strength and power granted by\nthe Almighty. It’s a great responsibility, and it’s our duty to use it for the\nprotection of our men. We save hundreds of lives by going across first. Lets\nus lead the army, firsthand.”\nHe paused.\n“So brave,” Shallan said, in what she hoped was a breathy, adoring\nvoice.\n“Well, it’s the right thing to do. But it is dangerous. That day, I leaped\nacross, but my father and I got pushed too far apart by the Parshendi. He\nwas forced to jump back across, and a blow to his leg meant that when he\nlanded, his greave—that’s a piece of armor on the leg—cracked. That made\nit dangerous for him to jump back again. I was left alone while he waited\nfor the bridge to lock down.”\nHe paused again. She was probably supposed to ask what happened\nnext.\n“What if you need to poop?” she asked instead.\n“Well, I put my back to the chasm and laid about me with my sword,\nintending to… Wait. What did you say?”\n“Poop,” Shallan said. “You’re out there on the battlefield, encased in\nmetal like a crab in its shell. What do you do if nature calls?”\n“I… er…” Adolin frowned at her. “That is not something any woman\nhas ever asked me before.”\n“Yay for originality!” Shallan said, though she blushed as she said it.\nJasnah would have been displeased.

Couldn’t Shallan mind her tongue for a\nsingle conversation? She’d gotten him talking about something he liked;\neverything had been going well. Now this.\n“Well,” Adolin said slowly, “every battle has breaks in the flow, and\nmen rotate in and out of the front lines. For every five minutes you’re\nfighting, you often have almost as many resting. When a Shardbearer pulls\nback, men inspect his armor for cracks, give him something to drink or eat,\nand help him with… what you just mentioned. It’s not something that\nmakes a good topic of conversation, Brightness. We don’t really talk about\nit.”\n“That’s precisely what makes it a good topic of conversation,” she said.\n“I can find out about wars and Shardbearers and glorious killing in the\nofficial accounts. The grimy details, though—nobody writes those down.”\n“Well, it does get grimy,” Adolin said with a grimace, taking a drink.\n“You can’t really… I can’t believe I’m saying this… you can’t really wipe\nyourself in Shardplate, so someone has to do it for you. Makes me feel like\nan infant. Then, sometimes, you just don’t have time…”\n“And?”\nHe inspected her, narrowing his eyes.\n“What?” she asked.\n“Just trying to determine if you’re secretly Wit wearing a wig. This is\nsomething he would do to me.”\n“I’m not doing anything to you,” she said. “I’m just curious.” And\nhonestly, she was. She’d thought about this. Perhaps more than it deserved\nconsideration.\n“Well,” Adolin said, “if you must know, an old adage on the battlefield\nteaches that it’s better to be embarrassed than dead. You can’t let anything\ndraw your attention from fighting.”\n“So…”\n“So yes, I, Adolin Kholin—cousin to the king, heir to the Kholin\nprincedom—have shat myself in my Shardplate. Three times, all on\npurpose.” He downed the rest of his wine. “You are a very strange woman.”\n“If I must remind you,” Shallan said, “you are the one who opened our\nconversation today with a joke about Sebarial’s flatulence.”\n“I guess I did at that.” He grinned. “This is not exactly going the way\nit’s supposed to, is it?”\n“Is that a bad thing?”\n“No,” Adolin said, then his grin widened. “Actually, it’s kind of\nrefreshing. Do you know how many times I’ve told that story about saving\nthe plateau run?”\n“I’m sure you were quite brave.”\n“Quite.”\n“Though probably not as brave as the poor men who have to clean your\narmor.”\nAdolin bellowed out a laugh. For the first time it seemed like something\ngenuine—an emotion from him that wasn’t scripted or expected. He\npounded his fist on the table, then waved for more wine, wiping a tear from\nhis eye. The grin he gave her threatened to bring out another blush.\nWait, Shallan thought, did that just… work? She was supposed to be\nacting feminine and delicate, not asking men what it’s like to have to\ndefecate in battle."

        "text": "Wait, Shallan thought, did that just… work? She was supposed to be\nacting feminine and delicate, not asking men what it’s like to have to\ndefecate in battle.\n“All right,” Adolin said, taking the cup of wine. He didn’t even glance\nat the serving woman this time. “What other dirty secrets do you want to\nknow? You’ve got me laid bare. There are tons of things the stories and\nofficial histories don’t mention.”\n“The chrysalises,” Shallan said, eager. “What do they look like?”\n“That’s what you want to know?” Adolin said, scratching his head. “I\nthought for sure you’d want to know about the chafing…”\nShallan got out her satchel, setting a piece of paper on the table and\nstarting a sketch. “From what I’ve been able to determine, nobody has done\na solid study on the Chasmfiends. There are some sketches of dead ones,\nbut that’s it, and the anatomy on those is dreadful.\n“They must have an interesting life cycle. They haunt these chasms, but\nI doubt they actually live here. There’s not enough food to support creatures\nof their size. That means they come here as part of some migratory pattern.\nThey come here to pupate. Have you ever seen a juvenile? Before they\nform the chrysalis?”\n“No,” Adolin said, scooting his chair around the table. “It often happens\nat night, and we don’t spot them until morning. They’re hard to see out\nthere, colored like rock. Makes me think that the Parshendi must be\nwatching us. We end up fighting over plateaus so often. It might mean they\nspot us mobilizing, then use the direction we’re going to judge where to\nfind the chrysalis. We get a head start, but they move faster over the Plains,\nso we arrive near the same time…”\nHe trailed off, cocking his head to get a better look at her sketch.\n“Storms! That’s really good, Shallan.”\n“Thanks.”\n“No, I mean really good.”\nShe’d done a quick sketch of several types of chrysalises she had read\nabout in her books, along with quick depictions of a man beside them for\nsize reference. It wasn’t very good—she’d done it for speed. Yet Adolin\nseemed genuinely impressed.\n“The shape and texture of the chrysalis,” Shallan said, “could help place\nthe chasmfiends in a family of similar animals.”\n“It looks most like this one,” Adolin said, scooting closer and pointing\nat one of the sketches. “When I’ve touched one, they’ve been hard as rock.\nIt’s hard to dig into one without a Shardblade. It can take men with\nhammers forever to break into one.”\n“Hmmm,” Shallan said, making a note. “You’re sure?”\n“Yeah. That’s how they look. Why?”\n“That’s the chrysalis of a yu-nerig,” Shallan said. “A greatshell from the\nseas around Marabethia. The people there feed criminals to them, I’m told.”\n“Ouch.”\n“This might be a false positive, a coincidence. The yu-nerig are an\naquatic species. The only time they come onto land is to pupate.

Seems\ntenuous to assume a relationship to the chasmfiends…”\n“Sure,” Adolin said, taking a drink of wine. “If you say so.”\n“This is probably important,” Shallan said.\n“For research. Yeah, I know. Aunt Navani is always talking about things\nlike that.”\n“This could be of more practical import than that,” Shallan said. “About\nhow many of these things total are killed by your armies and the Parshendi\neach month?”\nAdolin shrugged. “One every three days or so, I’d guess. Sometimes\nmore, sometimes less. So… fifteen or so a month?”\n“You see the problem?”\n“I…” Adolin shook his head. “No. Sorry. I’m kind of useless at\nanything that doesn’t involve someone getting stabbed.”\nShe smiled at him. “Nonsense. You proved skilled at choosing wine.”\n“I did that basically at random.”\n“And it tastes delicious,” Shallan said. “Empirical proof of your\nmethodology. Now, you probably don’t see the problem because you don’t\nhave the proper facts. Greatshells, generally, are slow to breed and slow to\ngrow. This is because most ecosystems can only support a small population\nof apex predators of this size.”\n“I’ve heard some of those words before.”\nShe looked to him, raising an eyebrow. He’d gotten a lot closer to her, in\norder to look at her drawing. He wore a faint cologne, a brisk woody scent.\nOh my…\n“All right, all right,” he said, chuckling as he inspected her drawings.\n“I’m not as dense as I feign. I see what you’re saying. You really think we\ncould kill enough of them that it could be a problem? I mean, people have\nbeen doing greatshell hunts for generations, and the beasts are still around.”\n“You’re not hunting them here, Adolin. You’re harvesting them. You’re\nsystematically destroying their juvenile population. Have fewer of them\nbeen pupating lately?”\n“Yeah,” he said, though he sounded reluctant. “We think it might be the\nseason.”\n“It might be. Or, it might be that, after over five years of harvesting, the\npopulation is starting to dwindle. Animals like the chasmfiends don’t\nnormally have predators. Suddenly losing a hundred and fifty or more of\ntheir numbers a year could be catastrophic to their population.”\nAdolin frowned. “The gemhearts we get feed the people of the\nwarcamps. Without a constant flow of new stones of reasonable size, the\nSoulcasters will eventually crack the ones we have, and we won’t be able to\nsupport the armies here.”\n“I’m not telling you to stop your hunts,” Shallan said, blushing. This\nprobably wasn’t the point she should be making. Urithiru and the parshmen,\nthat was the immediate problem. Still, she needed to gain Adolin’s trust. If\nshe could provide useful help regarding the chasmfiends, perhaps he’d\nlisten when she approached him with something even more revolutionary.\n“All I’m saying,” Shallan continued, “is that it’s worth thinking about\nand studying.

What would it be like if you could start raising chasmfiends,\ngrowing them to juveniles in batches like men raise chulls? Instead of\nhunting three a week, what if you could breed and harvest hundreds?”\n“That would be useful,” Adolin said thoughtfully. “What would you\nneed in order to make it happen?”\n“Well, I wasn’t saying… I mean…” She stopped herself. “I need to get\nout onto the Shattered Plains,” she said more firmly. “If I’m going to try to\nfigure out how to breed them, I’d need to see one of these chrysalises before\nit’s been cut into. Preferably, I get to see an adult chasmfiend, and—ideally\n—I’d like a captured juvenile to study.”\n“Just a small list of impossibilities.”\n“Well, you did ask.”\n“I might be able to get you onto the Plains,” Adolin said. “Father\npromised that he’d show Jasnah a dead chasmfiend, so I think he was\nplanning to take her out after a hunt. Seeing a chrysalis, though… those\nrarely appear close to camp. I’d have to take you dangerously close to\nParshendi territory.”\n“I’m sure you can protect me.”\nHe looked at her, expectant.\n“What?” Shallan asked.\n“I’m waiting for a wisecrack.”\n“I was serious,” Shallan said. “With you there, I’m certain the Parshendi\nwouldn’t dare get close.”\nAdolin smiled.\n“I mean,” she said, “the stench alone—”\n“I suspect I’m never going to live down telling you about that.”\n“Never,” Shallan agreed. “You were honest, detailed, and engaging.\nThose aren’t the sorts of things I let myself forget about a man.”\nHis smile broadened. Storms, those eyes…\nCareful, Shallan told herself. Careful! Kabsal took you in easily. Don’t\nrepeat that.\n“I’ll see what I can do,” Adolin said. “The Parshendi might not be an\nissue in the near future.”\n“Really?”\nHe nodded. “It’s not widely known, though we’ve told the highprinces.\nFather is going to be meeting with some of the Parshendi leaders tomorrow.\nIt could end up starting a peace negotiation.”\n“That’s fantastic!”\n“Yeah,” Adolin said. “I’m not hopeful. The assassin… anyway, we’ll\nsee what happens tomorrow, though I’ll have to do this between the other\nwork Father has for me.”\n“The duels,” Shallan said, leaning in. “What is going on there, Adolin?”\nHe seemed hesitant.\n“Whatever is going on in the camps now,” she said, speaking more\nsoftly, “Jasnah didn’t know about it. I feel woefully ignorant about politics\nhere, Adolin. Your father and Highprince Sadeas had a falling-out, I’ve\ngathered. The king has changed the nature of these plateau runs, and\neveryone is talking about how you’re dueling now. But from what I’ve been\nable to gather, you never stopped dueling.”"

But from what I’ve been\nable to gather, you never stopped dueling.”\n“It’s different,” he said. “Now I’m dueling to win.”\n“And you didn’t before?”\n“No, then I dueled to punish.” He glanced about, then met her eyes. “It\nbegan when my father started seeing visions…”\nHe continued. He poured out a surprising story, one with far greater\ndetail than she’d anticipated. A story of betrayal, and of hope. Visions of the\npast. A unified Alethkar, prepared to weather a coming storm.\nShe didn’t know what to make of it all, though she gathered that Adolin\nwas telling her of it because he knew the rumors in camp. She’d heard of\nDalinar’s fits, of course, and had an inkling of what Sadeas had done. When\nAdolin mentioned that his father wanted the Knights Radiant to return,\nShallan felt a chill. She glanced about for Pattern—he’d be close—but\ncouldn’t find him.\nThe meat of the story, at least in Adolin’s estimation, was the betrayal\nby Sadeas. The young prince’s eyes grew dark, face flushed, as he talked of\nbeing abandoned on the Plains, surrounded by enemies. He seemed\nembarrassed when he spoke of salvation by a lowly bridge crew.\nHe’s actually confiding in me, Shallan thought, feeling a thrill. She\nrested her freehand on his arm as he spoke, an innocent gesture, but it\nseemed to spur him forward as he quietly explained Dalinar’s plan. She\nwasn’t certain he should be sharing all of this with her. They barely knew\none another. But speaking of it seemed to lift a weight from Adolin’s back,\nand he grew more relaxed.\n“I guess,” Adolin said, “that’s the end of it. I’m supposed to win\nShardblades off the others, taking away their bite, embarrassing them. But I\ndon’t know if it will work.”\n“Why not?” Shallan asked.\n“The ones who agree to duel me aren’t important enough,” he said,\nforming a fist. “If I win too much from them, the real targets—the\nhighprinces—will get scared of me and refuse duels. I need matches that are\nmore high profile. No, what I need is to duel Sadeas. Pound that grinning\nface of his into the stones and take back my father’s Blade. He’s too oily,\nthough. We’ll never get him to agree.”\nShe found herself wishing desperately to do something, anything, to\nhelp. She felt herself melting at the intense concern in those eyes, the\npassion.\nRemember Kabsal… she reminded herself again.\nWell, Adolin wasn’t likely to try to assassinate her—but then, that didn’t\nmean she should let her brain turn to curry paste around him. She cleared\nher throat, tearing her eyes away from his and looking down at her sketch.\n“Bother,” she said. “I’ve left you upset. I’m not very good at this\nwooing thing.”\n“Could have fooled me…” Adolin said, resting his hand on her arm.\nShallan covered another blush by ducking her head and digging into her"

Give them away, or…” Storms. She didn’t want to start a genocide\nhere, did she? But these were the Voidbringers. “… or set them free or\nsomething. Get them out of the warcamps.”\n“How difficult would it be?” Adolin said. “Off the cuff, I’d say\nimpossible. That, or really impossible. Why would we even want to do\nsomething like that?”\n“Jasnah thought they might be related to the Voidbringers and their\nreturn.”\nAdolin shook his head, looking bemused. “Shallan, we can barely get\nthe highprinces to fight this war properly. If my father or the king were to\nrequire everyone to get rid of their parshmen… Storms! It would break the\nkingdom in a heartbeat.”\nSo Jasnah was right on that count as well. Unsurprising. Shallan was\ninterested to see how violently Adolin himself opposed the idea. He took a\nbig gulp of wine, seeming utterly floored.\nTime to pull back, then. This meeting had gone very well; she wouldn’t\nwant to end it on a sour note. “It was something Jasnah said,” Shallan said,\n“but really, I’d rather that Brightlady Navani judge how important a\nsuggestion it was. She would know her daughter, her notes, better than\nanyone.”\nAdolin nodded. “So go to her.”\nShallan tapped the paper in her fingers. “I’ve tried. She’s not been very\naccommodating.”\n“Aunt Navani can be overbearing sometimes.”\n“It’s not that,” Shallan said, scanning the words on the letter. It was a\nreply she’d gotten after requesting to meet the woman and discuss her\ndaughter’s work. “She doesn’t want to meet with me. She barely seems to\nwant to acknowledge I exist.”\nAdolin sighed. “She doesn’t want to believe. About Jasnah, I mean. You\nrepresent something to her—the truth, in a way. Give her time. She just\nneeds to grieve.”\n“I’m not certain if this is something that should wait, Adolin.”\n“I’ll talk to her,” he said. “How about that?”\n“Wonderful,” she said. “Much like you yourself.”"

That’s not something that will go over well.”\nShe nodded absently, then realized she’d been staring at him. She was\ngoing to kiss those lips of his someday. She let herself imagine it.\nAnd, Ash’s eyes… he had a very friendly way about him. She hadn’t\nexpected that in someone so highborn. She’d never actually met anyone of\nhis rank before coming to the Shattered Plains, but all the men she knew\nnear his level had been stiff and even angry.\nNot Adolin. Storms, but being with him was something else she could\nget very, very used to.\nPeople began to stir on the patio. She ignored them for a moment, but\nthen many began to stand up from their seats, looking eastward.\nHighstorm. Right.\nShallan felt a spike of alarm as she looked toward the Origin of Storms.\nThe wind picked up, leaves and bits of refuse fluttering across the patio.\nDown below, the Outer Market had been packed up, tents folded away,\nawnings withdrawn, windows closed. The entirety of the warcamps braced\nitself.\nShallan stuffed her things into her satchel, then rose to her feet, stepping\nto the edge of the terrace, freehand fingers on the stone railing there. Adolin\njoined her. Behind them, people whispered and gathered. She heard iron\ngrinding across stone; the parshmen had begun pulling away the tables and\nchairs, stowing them to both protect them and make a path for the lighteyes\nto retreat to safety.\nThe horizon had bled from light to dark, like a man flushing with anger.\nShallan gripped the railing, watching the entire world transform. Vines\nwithdrew, rockbuds closed. Grass hid in its holes. They knew, somehow.\nThey all knew.\nThe air grew chill and wet, and prestorm winds gusted against her,\nblowing her hair back. Below and just to the north, the warcamps had piled\nrefuse and waste to be blown away with the storm. It was a forbidden\npractice in most civilized areas, where that waste could blow into the next\ntown. Out here, there was no next town.\nThe horizon grew even darker. A few people on the balcony fled to the\nback room’s safety, their nerves getting the better of them. Most stayed,\nsilent. Windspren zipped in tiny rivers of light overhead. Shallan took\nAdolin by the arm, staring eastward. Minutes passed until finally, she saw\nit.\nThe stormwall.\nA huge sheet of water and debris blown before the storm.

In moments, only a handful remained, Shallan and Adolin among\nthem. She watched, transfixed, as the storm approached. It took longer than\nshe’d expected. It was moving at a terrible speed, but it was so large, they’d\nbeen able to spot it from quite a distance.\nIt consumed the Shattered Plains, one plateau at a time. Soon, it loomed\nover the warcamps, coming on with a roar.\n“We should go,” Adolin eventually said. She barely heard him.\nLife. Something lived inside that storm, something that no artist had\never drawn, no scholar had ever described.\n“Shallan!” Adolin began to tow her toward the protected room. She\ngrabbed the railing with her freehand, remaining in place, clutching her\nsatchel to her chest with her safehand. That humming, that was Pattern.\nShe’d never been so close to a highstorm. Even when she’d been only\ninches away from one, separated by a window shutter, she had not been as\nclose as she was now. Watching that darkness descend upon the\nwarcamps…\nI need to draw.\n“Shallan!” Adolin said, pulling her away from the railing. “They’ll close\nthe doors if we don’t go now!”\nWith a start, she realized that everyone else had left the balcony. She\nallowed Adolin to get her moving, and she joined him in a dash across the\nempty patio. They reached the room at the side, packed with huddled\nlighteyes who watched in terror. Adolin’s guards entered right after her, and\nseveral parshmen slammed the thick doors. The bar thumped in place,\nlocking out the sky, leaving them to the light of spheres on the walls.\nShallan counted. The highstorm hit—she could feel it. Something\nbeyond the thumping of the door and the distant sound of thunder.\n“Six seconds,” she said.\n“What?” Adolin asked. His voice was hushed, and others in the room\nspoke in whispers.\n“It took six seconds after the servants closed the doors until the storm\nhit. We could have spent that much longer out there.”\nAdolin regarded her with an incredulous expression. “When you first\nrealized what we were doing on that balcony, you seemed terrified.”\n“I was.”\n“Now you wish you’d stayed out until the last moment before the storm\nhit?”\n“I… yeah,” she said, blushing.\n“I have no idea what to make of you.” Adolin regarded her. “You’re not\nlike anyone I’ve met.”\n“It’s my air of feminine mystique.”\nHe raised an eyebrow.\n“It’s a term we use,” she said, “when we’re feeling particularly erratic.\nIt’s considered polite not to point out that you know this. Now, do we just…\nwait in here?”\n“In this box of a room?” Adolin asked, sounding amused. “We’re\nlighteyes, not livestock.” He gestured to the side, where several servants\nhad opened doors leading to places burrowed deeper into the mountain.\n“Two sitting rooms.

Sometimes during a highstorm, the genders would\nretire to separate rooms to chat. It looked like the winehouse followed this\ntradition. They’d probably have finger food. Shallan walked toward the\nindicated room, but Adolin rested a hand on her arm, making her pause.\n“I’ll see about getting you out onto the Shattered Plains,” he said.\n“Amaram wants to go explore more, he’s said, than he gets to during a\nplateau run. I think he and Father are having dinner to talk about it\ntomorrow night, and I can ask then if I can bring you. I’ll also talk to Aunt\nNavani. Maybe we can discuss what I’ve come up with at the feast next\nweek?”\n“There’s a feast next week?”\n“There’s always a feast next week,” Adolin said. “We just have to figure\nout who’s throwing it. I’ll send to you.”\nShe smiled, and then they separated. Next week is not soon enough, she\nthought. I’ll have to find a way to drop in on him when it’s not too awkward.\nHad she really promised to help him breed chasmfiends? As if she\nneeded something else to take her time. Still, she felt good about the day as\nshe entered the women’s sitting room, her guards taking their places in the\nappropriate waiting room.\nShallan strolled through the women’s room, which was well lit with\ngemstones gathered in goblets—cut stones, but not in spheres. An\nexpensive display.\nShe felt that, if her teachers had been watching, both would have been\ndisappointed at her conversation with Adolin. Tyn would have wanted her\nto manipulate the prince more; Jasnah would have wanted Shallan to be\nmore poised, more in control of her tongue.\nIt seemed that Adolin liked her anyway. That made her want to cheer.\nThe looks of the women about her washed away that emotion. Some\nturned backs toward Shallan, and others pressed their lips together and\nlooked her up and down skeptically. Courting the kingdom’s most eligible\nbachelor was not going to make her popular, not when she was an outsider.\nThat didn’t bother Shallan. She didn’t need acceptance from these\nwomen; she just needed to find Urithiru and the secrets it contained.\nGaining Adolin’s trust was a big step in that direction.\nShe decided to reward herself by stuffing her face with sweets and\nthinking further on her plan to sneak into Brightlord Amaram’s house.\n50.

He should have felt safe in this bunker of\nrock, but there was something about storms that undercut any sense of\nsecurity, no matter how rational. He’d be glad for the Weeping, and the end\nof the highstorms for a few weeks.\nAdolin raised his cup toward Elit, who stomped past. He hadn’t seen the\nman above, on the winehouse terrace, but this chamber also served as a\nhighstorm bunker for several shops in the Outer Market.\n“Are you ready for our duel?” Adolin asked. “You’ve made me wait an\nentire week so far, Elit.”\nThe short, balding man took a drink of wine, then lowered his cup, not\nlooking at Adolin. “My cousin is planning to kill you for challenging me,”\nhe said. “Right after he kills me for agreeing to the challenge.” He finally\nturned toward Adolin. “But when I stomp you into the sands and claim all\nof your family’s Shards, I’ll be the rich one and he’ll be forgotten. Am I\nready for our duel? I long for it, Adolin Kholin.”\n“You’re the one who wanted to wait,” Adolin noted.\n“The more time to savor what I’m going to do to you.” Elit smiled with\nwhite lips, then moved on.\nCreepy fellow. Well, Adolin would deal with him in two days, the date\nof their duel. Before that, though, was tomorrow’s meeting with the\nParshendi Shardbearer. It loomed over him like a thunderhead. What would\nit mean, if they finally found peace?\nHe mulled over that thought, regarding his wine and listening with half\nan ear to Elit chatting behind him with someone. Adolin recognized that\nvoice, didn’t he?\nAdolin sat upright, then looked over his shoulder. How long had Sadeas\nbeen back there, and why hadn’t Adolin spotted him when first entering?\nSadeas turned to him, a calm smile on his face.\nMaybe he’ll just…\nSadeas strolled up to Adolin, hands clasped behind his back, wearing a\nfashionable open-fronted short brown coat and an embroidered green stock.\nThe buttons along the front of the coat were gemstones. Emeralds to match\nthe stock.\nStorms. He did not want to deal with Sadeas today.\nThe highprince took the seat beside Adolin, their backs to a hearth that a\nparshman had begun stoking. The room contained a low hum of nervous\nconversation. You could never quite be comfortable, no matter how pretty\nthe decor, when a highstorm raged outside.\n“Young Adolin,” Sadeas said. “What do you think of my coat?”\nAdolin took a gulp of wine, not trusting himself to reply. I should just\nget up and walk away. But he didn’t. A small part of him wished for Sadeas\nto provoke him, push away his inhibitions, drive him to do something\nstupid. Killing the man right here, right now, would likely earn Adolin an\nexecution—or at least an exile. It might be worth either punishment.\n“You’ve always been so keen-eyed when it comes to style,” Sadeas"

I do think the coat is splendid, but I\nworry that the short cut might be trending out of fashion. What is the latest\nfrom Liafor?”\nSadeas pulled out the front of his jacket, moving his hand to display a\nring that matched the buttons. The ring’s emerald, like those on the jacket,\nwas uncut. They glowed softly with Stormlight.\nUncut emeralds, Adolin thought, then looked up to meet Sadeas’s eyes.\nThe man smiled.\n“The gemstones are recent acquisitions,” Sadeas noted. “I am fond of\nthem.”\nGained from doing a plateau run with Ruthar that he wasn’t supposed to\nhave been on. Racing ahead of the other highprinces, like this was the old\ndays, where each prince tried to be first and claim their winnings.\n“I hate you,” Adolin whispered.\n“As well you should,” Sadeas said, letting go of his coat. He nodded\ntoward Adolin’s bridgeman guards, watching with overt hostility nearby.\n“My former property is treating you well? I’ve seen their like patrolling the\nmarket here. I find that amusing for reasons I doubt I could ever properly\nexpress.”\n“They patrol,” Adolin said, “to create a better Alethkar.”\n“Is that what Dalinar wants? I am surprised to hear it. He talks of\njustice, of course, but he doesn’t allow justice to take its course. Not\nproperly.”\n“And I know where you’re going, Sadeas,” Adolin snapped. “You’re\nannoyed that we haven’t been letting you put judges into our warcamp as\nHighprince of Information. Well, I’ll have you know that Father has decided\nto let—”\n“Highprince of… Information? You didn’t hear? I recently renounced\nthe title.”\n“What?”\n“Yes,” Sadeas said. “I fear I was never a good match for the position.\nMy Shalashian temperament, perhaps. I wish Dalinar good fortune in\nfinding a replacement—though from what I’ve heard, the other highprinces\nhave come to an agreement that none of us are… suited to these kinds of\nappointments.”\nHe renounces the king’s authority, Adolin thought. Storms, this was bad.\nHe gritted his teeth, and found himself reaching his hand to the side to\nsummon his Blade. No. He pulled the hand back. He’d find a way to force\nthis man into the dueling ring. Killing Sadeas now—no matter how much\nhe deserved it—would undermine the very laws and codes Adolin’s father\nwas working so hard to uphold.\nBut storms… Adolin was tempted.\nSadeas smiled again. “Do you think me an evil man, Adolin?”\n“That’s too simple a term,” Adolin snapped. “You’re not just evil,\nyou’re a selfish, crem-crusted eel who is trying to strangle this kingdom\nwith his bulbous, bastard hand.”\n“Eloquent,” Sadeas said. “You realize I created this kingdom.”\n“You only helped my father and uncle.”\n“Men who are both gone,” Sadeas said. “The Blackthorn is as dead as"

I’m trying with\neverything I have to keep a few chunks of it strong enough to weather the\ncollapse your father is bringing.”\n“Don’t call me son,” Adolin hissed.\n“Fine,” Sadeas said, standing. “But I’ll tell you one thing. I’m glad you\nsurvived the events on the Tower that day. You’ll make a fine highprince in\nthe coming months. I have a feeling that in ten years or so—following an\nextended civil war between the two of us—our alliance will be a strong one.\nBy then, you’ll understand why I did what I did.”\n“I doubt it. I’ll have rammed my sword through your gut long before\nthat, Sadeas.”\nSadeas raised his cup of wine, then walked off, joining a different group\nof lighteyes. Adolin let out a long sigh of exhaustion, then leaned back\nagainst the chair. Nearby, his short bridgeman guard—the one with the\nsilver at his temples—gave Adolin a nod of respect.\nAdolin slumped there, feeling drained, until long after the highstorm\nended and people started to depart. Adolin preferred to wait until the rain\nstopped completely before leaving, anyway. He never had liked how his\nuniform looked when it got wet.\nEventually, he rose, collected his two guards, and stepped out of the\nwinehouse to a grey sky and a deserted Outer Market. He was mostly over\nthe conversation with Sadeas, and kept reminding himself that up to that\npoint the day had been going very well.\nShallan and her carriage had already gone, of course. He could have\nordered a ride for himself, but after being locked away for so long, it felt\ngood to be walking in the open air; chill, wet, and fresh from the storm.\nHands in the pockets of his uniform, he started along a pathway through\nthe Outer Market, strolling around puddles. Gardeners had begun growing\nornamental shalebark along the sides of the path, though it wasn’t very high\nyet, just a few inches. A good shalebark ridge could take years to grow\nproperly.\nThose two insufferable bridgemen followed along behind him. Not that\nAdolin minded the men personally—they seemed like amiable enough\nfellows, particularly when away from their commander. Adolin just didn’t\nlike needing minders. Though the storm had passed into the west, the\nafternoon felt gloomy. Clouds obscured the sun, which had moved from its\nzenith and was drooping slowly toward the distant horizon. He didn’t pass\nmany people, so his only companions were the bridgemen—well, those and\na legion of cremlings that had emerged to feast upon plants that lapped at\nwater in pools.\nWhy did plants spend so much more time in their shells out here than\nthey did back home?

He smiled, forcing thoughts of\nSadeas into the back of his mind. This thing with Shallan, it was working. It\nalways worked at first though, so he contained his enthusiasm.\nShe was marvelous. Exotic, witty, and not smothered in Alethi propriety.\nShe was smarter than he was, but she didn’t make him feel stupid. That was\na large point in her favor.\nHe passed out of the market, then crossed the open ground beyond it,\neventually reaching Dalinar’s warcamp. The guards let him through with\ncrisp salutes. He idled in the warcamp market, comparing the wares he saw\nhere with those in the market near the Pinnacle.\nWhat will happen to this place, Adolin thought, when the war stops? It\nwould end someday. Perhaps tomorrow, with the negotiations with the\nParshendi Shardbearer.\nThe Alethi presence wouldn’t end here, not with the chasmfiends to\nhunt, but surely this large a population couldn’t continue, could it? Could he\nreally be witnessing a permanent shift of the king’s seat?\nHours later—after spending some time at jewelry shops looking for\nsomething for Shallan—Adolin and his guards reached his father’s\ncomplex. By then, Adolin’s feet were starting to ache and the camp had\ngrown dark. He yawned, making his way through the cavernous guts of his\nfather’s bunkerish dwelling. Wasn’t it about time they built a proper\nmansion? Being an example for the men was all well and good, but there\nwere certain standards a family like theirs should uphold. Particularly if the\nShattered Plains were going to remain as important as they had been. It\nwas…\nHe hesitated, stopping at an intersection and looking right. He’d been\nintending to visit the kitchens for a snack, but a group of men moved and\nthrew shadows in the other direction. Hushed whispers.\n“What is this?” Adolin demanded, marching toward the gathering, his\ntwo guards following. “Soldiers? What have you found?”\nThe men scrambled to turn and salute, spears to shoulders. They were\nmore bridgemen from Kaladin’s unit. Just beyond them were the doors to\nthe wing where Dalinar, Adolin, and Renarin all made their quarters. Those\ndoors lay open, and the men had set spheres on the ground.\nWhat was going on? Normally, two or maybe four men would be on\nguard here. Not eight. And… why was there a parshman wearing a\nguardsman uniform, holding a spear with the others?\n“Sir!” said a lanky, long-armed man at the front of the bridgemen. “We\nwere just heading in to check on the highprince, when…”\nAdolin didn’t hear the rest. He pushed through the bridgemen, finally\nseeing what the spheres illuminated on the floor of the sitting room.\nMore scratched glyphs. Adolin knelt down, trying to read them.\nUnfortunately, they hadn’t been drawn in any kind of picture to help. He\nthought they were numbers…\n“Thirty-two days,” said one of the bridgemen, a short Azish man. “Seek\nthe center.”\nDamnation. “Have you told anyone of this?” Adolin asked."

The white fog appeared—manifesting as little vines\nsprouting in the air—before snapping into the form of a Shardblade, which\nsuddenly weighed down his hand.\nHe stood in the sitting room, those foreboding markings staring up at\nhim, as if in silent challenge. The closed door kept the bridgemen out so\nonly he, Dalinar, and Navani would be privy to the discussion. Adolin\nwanted to use the Blade to cut those cursed glyphs away. Dalinar had\nproven that he was sane. Aunt Navani almost had an entire document of the\nDawnchant translated, using the words of Father’s visions as a guide!\nThe visions were from the Almighty. It all made sense.\nNow this.\n“They were made with a knife,” Navani said, kneeling beside the\nglyphs. The sitting room was a large open area, used for receiving callers or\nholding meetings. Doors beyond led to the study and the bedrooms.\n“This knife,” Dalinar replied, holding up a side knife of the style most\nlighteyes wore. “My knife.”\nThe edge was blunted and still bore flecks of stone from the gouges.\nThe scratches matched the size of the blade. They’d found it just in front of\nthe door to Dalinar’s study, where he’d spent the highstorm. Alone.\nNavani’s carriage had been delayed, and she’d been forced to return to the\npalace or risk being caught in the storm.\n“Someone else could have taken it and done this,” Adolin snapped.\n“They could have sneaked into your study, grabbed it while you were\nconsumed by the visions, and come out here…”\nThe other two looked at him.\n“Often,” Navani said, “the simplest answer is the right one.”\nAdolin sighed, dismissing his Blade and slumping down in a chair\nbeside the offending glyphs. His father stood tall. In fact, Dalinar Kholin\nnever seemed to have stood as tall as he did now, hands clasped behind his\nback, eyes away from the glyphs, toward the wall—eastward.\nDalinar was a rock, a boulder too big for even storms to move. He\nseemed so sure. It was something to cling to.\n“You don’t remember anything?” Navani asked Dalinar, rising.\n“No.” He turned to Adolin. “I think it’s obvious now that I was behind\neach of these. Why does that bother you so, son?”\n“It’s the idea of you scribbling on the ground,” Adolin said, shivering.\n“Lost in one of those visions, not in control of yourself.”\n“The Almighty’s path for me is a strange one,” Dalinar said. “Why do I\nneed to get the information this way? Scratches on the ground or the wall?\nWhy not say it to me plainly in the visions?”\n“It’s foretelling, you realize,” Adolin said softly. “Seeing the future. A"

A\nthing of the Voidbringers.”\n“Yes.” Dalinar narrowed his eyes. “Seek the center. What do you think,\nNavani? The center of the Shattered Plains? What truths hide there?”\n“The Parshendi, obviously.”\nThey talked about the center of the Shattered Plains as if they knew of\nthe place. But no man had been there, only Parshendi. To the Alethi, the\nword “center” just referred to the vast open expanse of unexplored plateaus\nbeyond the scouted rims.\n“Yes,” Adolin’s father said. “But where? Maybe they move around?\nMaybe there is no Parshendi city in the center.”\n“They would only be able to move if they had Soulcasters,” Navani\nsaid, “which I personally doubt. They’ll have entrenched somewhere. They\naren’t a nomadic people, and there’s no reason for them to move.”\n“If we can make peace,” Dalinar mused, “reaching the center would be\na lot easier…” He looked to Adolin. “Have the bridgemen fill those\nscratches with crem, then have them pull the rug over that section of floor.”\n“I’ll see it done.”\n“Good,” Dalinar said, seeming distant. “After that, get some sleep, son.\nTomorrow is a big day.”\nAdolin nodded. “Father. Were you aware that there is a parshman\namong the bridgemen?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “There has been one among their numbers from the\nbeginning, but they didn’t arm him until I gave them permission.”\n“Why would you do such a thing?”\n“Out of curiosity,” Dalinar said. He turned and nodded toward the\nglyphs on the floor. “Tell me, Navani. Assuming these numbers are\ncounting toward a date, is it a day when a highstorm will come?”\n“Thirty-two days?” Navani asked. “That will be in the middle of the\nWeeping. Thirty-two days won’t even be the exact end of the year, but two\ndays ahead of it. I can’t fathom the significance.”\n“Ah, it was too convenient an answer anyway. Very well.

The whole of it—the visions, the command to refound\nthe Knights Radiant, the preparation for a disaster that might or might not\ncome—was a package. Adolin had already decided to believe that his father\nwasn’t mad. Further worry was pointless.\nThe other decision might get him into trouble. He left his quarters,\nentering the sitting room, where Dalinar was already planning with Navani,\nGeneral Khal, Teshav, and Captain Kaladin. Renarin, frustratingly, guarded\nthe door wearing a Bridge Four uniform. He’d refused to give up on that\ndecision of his, despite Adolin’s insistence.\n“We’ll need the bridgemen again,” Dalinar said. “If something goes\nwrong, we may need a quick retreat.”\n“I’ll prepare Bridges Five and Twelve for the day, sir,” Kaladin said.\n“Those two seem nostalgic for their bridges, and talk about the bridge runs\nwith fondness.”\n“Weren’t those bloodbaths?” Navani asked.\n“They were,” Kaladin said, “but soldiers are a strange lot, Brightness. A\ndisaster unifies them. These men would never want to go back, but they still\nidentify as bridgemen.”\nNearby, General Khal nodded in understanding, though Navani still\nseemed baffled.\n“I’ll take my position here,” Dalinar said, holding up a map of the\nShattered Plains. “We can scout the meeting plateau first, while I wait. It\napparently has some odd rock formations.”\n“That sounds good,” Brightness Teshav said.\n“It does,” Adolin said, joining the group, “except for one thing. You\nwon’t be there, Father.”\n“Adolin,” Dalinar said with a suffering tone. “I know you think this is\ntoo dangerous, but—”\n“It is too dangerous,” Adolin said. “The assassin is still out there—and\nhe attacked us last on the very day the Parshendi messenger came to camp.\nNow, we have a meeting with the enemy out on the Shattered Plains?\nFather, you can’t go.”\n“I have to,” Dalinar said. “Adolin, this could mean an end to the war. It\ncould mean answers—why they attacked in the first place. I will not give up\nthis opportunity.”\n“We’re not going to give it up,” Adolin said. “We’re just going to do\nthings a little differently.”\n“How?” Dalinar asked, narrowing his eyes.\n“Well for one thing,” Adolin said, “I’m going to go in your place.”\n“Impossible,” Dalinar said, “I won’t risk my son on—”\n“Father!” Adolin snapped. “This is not subject to discussion!”\nThe room fell silent. Dalinar lowered his hand from the map. Adolin\nstuck out his jaw, meeting his father’s eyes. Storms, it was difficult to deny\nDalinar Kholin. Did his father realize the presence he had, the way he\nmoved people about by sheer force of expectation?\nNobody contradicted him. Dalinar did what he wanted. Fortunately,\nthese days those motives had a noble purpose. But in many ways he was the\nsame man he had been twenty years ago, when he’d conquered a kingdom."

But in many ways he was the\nsame man he had been twenty years ago, when he’d conquered a kingdom.\nHe was the Blackthorn, and he got what he wanted.\nExcept today.\n“You are too important,” Adolin said, pointing. “Deny that. Deny that\nyour visions are vital. Deny that if you die, Alethkar would fall apart. Deny\nthat every single person in this room is less important than you are.”\nDalinar drew in a deep breath, then exhaled slowly. “It shouldn’t be so.\nThe kingdom needs to be strong enough to survive the loss of one man, no\nmatter who.”\n“Well, it’s not there yet,” Adolin said. “To get it there, we’re going to\nneed you. And that means you need to let us watch out for you. I’m sorry,\nFather, but once in a while you just have to let someone else do their job.\nYou can’t fix every problem with your own hands.”\n“He’s right, sir,” Kaladin said. “You really shouldn’t be risking yourself\nout on those Plains. Not if there’s another option.”\n“I fail to see that there is one,” Dalinar said, his tone cool.\n“Oh, there is,” Adolin said. “But I’m going to need to borrow Renarin’s\nShardplate.”\n* * *\nThe strangest thing about this experience, in Adolin’s estimation, wasn’t\nwearing his father’s old armor. Despite the outward stylistic differences,\nsuits of Shardplate all tended to fit similarly. The armor adapted, and within\na short time after donning it, the Plate felt exactly like Adolin’s own.\nIt also wasn’t strange to ride at the front of the force, Dalinar’s banner\nflapping over his head. Adolin had been leading them to battle on his own\nfor six weeks now.\nNo, the strangest part was riding his father’s horse.\nGallant was a large black animal, bulkier and squatter than Sureblood,\nAdolin’s horse. Gallant looked like a warhorse even when compared to\nother Ryshadium. So far as Adolin knew, no man had ever ridden him but\nDalinar. Ryshadium were finicky that way. It had taken a lengthy\nexplanation from Dalinar to even get the horse to allow Adolin to hold the\nreins, let alone climb into the saddle.\nIt had eventually worked, but Adolin wouldn’t dare ride Gallant into\nbattle; he was pretty sure the beast would throw him off and run away,\nlooking to protect Dalinar. It did feel odd climbing on a horse that wasn’t\nSureblood. He kept expecting Gallant to move differently than he did, turn\nhis head at the wrong times. When Adolin patted his neck, the horse’s mane\nfelt off to him in ways he couldn’t explain. He and his Ryshadium were\nmore than simply rider and horse, and he found himself oddly melancholy\nto be out on a ride without Sureblood.\nFoolishness. He had to stay focused.

        "text": "meeting plateau, which had a large, oddly shaped mound of rock near the\ncenter. This plateau was close to the Alethi side of the Plains, but much\nfarther south than Adolin had ever gone. Early patrols had said chasmfiends\nwere more common out in this region, but they never spotted a chrysalis\nhere. Some kind of hunting ground, but not a place for pupating?\nThe Parshendi weren’t there yet. When the scouts reported that the\nplateau was secure, Adolin urged Gallant across the mobile bridge. He felt\nwarm in his Plate; the seasons, it seemed, had finally decided to inch\nthrough spring and maybe even toward summer.\nHe approached the rock mound at the center. It really was odd. Adolin\ncircled it, noticing its shape, ridged in places, almost like…\n“It’s a chasmfiend,” Adolin realized. He passed the face, a hollowed-out\npiece of stone that evoked the exact feeling of a chasmfiend’s head. A\nstatue? No, it was too natural. A chasmfiend had died here centuries ago,\nand instead of being blown away, had slowly crusted over with crem.\nThe result was eerie. The crem had duplicated the creature’s form,\nclinging to the carapace, entombing it. The hulking rock seemed like a\ncreature born of stone, like the ancient stories of Voidbringers.\nAdolin shivered, nudging the horse away from the stone corpse and\ntoward the other side of the plateau. Shortly, he heard alarms from the\noutrunners. Parshendi coming. He steeled himself, ready to summon his\nShardblade. Behind him arrayed a group of bridgemen, ten in number,\nincluding that parshman. Captain Kaladin had remained with Dalinar back\nin the warcamp, just in case.\nAdolin was the one more exposed. Part of him wished for the assassin to\ncome today. So Adolin could try himself again. Of all the duels he hoped to\nfight in the future, this one—against the man who had killed his uncle—\nwould be the most important, even more than taking down Sadeas.\nThe assassin did not make an appearance as a group of two hundred\nParshendi crossed from the next plateau, jumping gracefully and landing on\nthe meeting plateau. Adolin’s soldiers stirred, armor clanking, spears\nlowering. It had been years since men and Parshendi had met without blood\nbeing spilled.\n“All right,” Adolin said in his helm. “Fetch my scribe.”\nBrightness Inadara was carried up through the ranks in a palanquin.\nDalinar wanted Navani with him—ostensibly because he wanted her\nadvice, but probably also to protect her.\n“Let’s go,” Adolin said, nudging Gallant forward. They crossed the\nplateau, just him and Brightness Inadara, who rose from her palanquin to\nwalk. She was a wizened matron, with grey hair she cut short for simplicity.\nHe’d seen sticks with more flesh on them than she had, but she was keen-\nminded and as trustworthy a scribe as they had.\nThe Parshendi Shardbearer emerged from the ranks and strode forward\non the rocks alone. Uncaring, unworried. This was a confident one."

This was a confident one.\nAdolin dismounted and went the rest of the way on foot, Inadara at his\nside. They stopped a few feet from the Parshendi, the three of them alone on\nan expanse of rock, the fossilized chasmfiend staring at them from the left.\n“I am Eshonai,” the Parshendi said. “Do you remember me?”\n“No,” Adolin said. He pitched his voice down to try and match the voice\nof his father, and hoped that—with the helm in place—it would be enough\nto fool this woman, who couldn’t know well what Dalinar sounded like.\n“Not surprising,” Eshonai said. “I was young and unimportant when we\nfirst met. Barely worth remembering.”\nAdolin had originally expected Parshendi conversation to be\nsingsongish, from what he’d heard said of them. That wasn’t the case at all.\nEshonai had a rhythm to her words, the way she emphasized them and\nwhere she paused. She changed tones, but the result was more of a chant\nthan a song.\nInadara took out a writing board and spanreed, then started writing\ndown what Eshonai said.\n“What is this?” Eshonai demanded.\n“I came alone, as you asked,” Adolin said, trying to project his father’s\nair of command. “But I will record what is said and send it back to my\ngenerals.”\nEshonai did not raise her faceplate, so Adolin had a good excuse not to\nraise his. They stared at each other through eye slits. This was not going as\nwell as his father had hoped, but it was about what Adolin had expected.\n“We are here,” Adolin said, using the words his father had suggested he\nbegin with, “to discuss the terms of a Parshendi surrender.”\nEshonai laughed. “That is not the point at all.”\n“Then what?” Adolin demanded. “You seemed eager to meet with me.\nWhy?”\n“Things have changed since I spoke with your son, Blackthorn.\nImportant things.”\n“What things?”\n“Things you cannot imagine,” Eshonai said.\nAdolin waited, as if pondering, but actually giving Inadara time to\ncorrespond with the warcamps. Inadara leaned up to him, whispering what\nNavani and Dalinar had written for him to say.\n“We tire of this war, Parshendi,” Adolin said. “Your numbers dwindle.\nWe know this. Let us make a truce, one that would benefit us both.”\n“We are not as weak as you believe,” Eshonai said.\nAdolin found himself frowning. When she’d spoken to him before,\nshe’d seemed passionate, inviting. Now she was cold and dismissive. Was\nthat right? She was Parshendi. Perhaps human emotions didn’t apply to her.\nInadara whispered more to him.\n“What do you want?” Adolin asked, speaking the words his father sent.\n“How can there be peace?”\n“There will be peace, Blackthorn, when one of us is dead. I came here"

I came here\nbecause I wanted to see you with my own eyes, and I wanted to warn you.\nWe have just changed the rules of this conflict. Squabbling over gemstones\nno longer matters.”\nNo longer matters? Adolin started to sweat. She makes it sound like they\nwere playing their own game all this time. Not desperate at all. Could the\nAlethi have misjudged everything so profoundly?\nShe turned to go.\nNo. All of this, just to have the meeting puff into smoke? Storm it!\n“Wait!” Adolin cried, stepping forward. “Why? Why are you acting like\nthis? What is wrong?”\nShe looked back at him. “You really want to end this?”\n“Yes. Please. I want peace. Regardless of the cost.”\n“Then you will have to destroy us.”\n“Why?” Adolin repeated. “Why did you kill Gavilar, all those years\nago? Why betray our treaty?”\n“King Gavilar,” Eshonai said, as if mulling over the name. “He should\nnot have revealed his plans to us that night. Poor fool. He did not know. He\nbragged, thinking we would welcome the return of our gods.” She shook\nher head, then turned again and jogged off, armor clinking.\nAdolin stepped back, feeling useless. If his father had been there, would\nhe have been able to do more? Inadara still wrote, sending the words to\nDalinar.\nA reply from him finally came. “Return to the warcamps. There is\nnothing you, or I myself, could have done. Clearly, her mind is already\nmade up.”\nAdolin spent the return ride brooding. When he finally reached the\nwarcamps a few hours later, he found his father in conference with Navani,\nKhal, Teshav, and the army’s four battalionlords.\nTogether, they pored over the words that Inadara had sent. A group of\nparshman servants quietly brought wine and fruit. Teleb—wearing the Plate\nthat Adolin had won from his duel with Eranniv—watched from the side of\nthe room, Shardhammer on his back, faceplate up. His people had once\nruled Alethkar. What did he think of all this? The man usually kept his\nopinions to himself.\nAdolin stomped into the room, pulling off his father’s—well, Renarin’s\n—helm. “I should have let you go,” Adolin said. “It wasn’t a trap. Perhaps\nyou could have talked sense to her.”\n“These are the people who murdered my brother on the very night they\nsigned a treaty with him,” Dalinar said, inspecting maps on the table. “It\nseems they have not changed at all from that day. You did perfectly, son; we\nknow everything we need to.”\n“We do?” Adolin said, walking up to the table, helm under arm.\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, looking up. “We know that they will not agree to\npeace, no matter what. My conscience is clear.”\nAdolin looked over the outspread maps. “What is this?” he asked,"

My conscience is clear.”\nAdolin looked over the outspread maps. “What is this?” he asked,\nnoting troop movement symbols. They were all pointed across the Shattered\nPlains.\n“A plan of assault,” Dalinar said quietly. “The Parshendi will not deal\nwith us, and they are planning something big. Something to change the war.\nThe time has come to bring the fight directly to them and end this war, one\nway or another.”\n“Stormfather,” Adolin said. “And if we’re surrounded while we’re out\nthere?”\n“We will take everyone,” Dalinar said, “our whole army, and as many of\nthe highprinces as will join me. Soulcasters for food. The Parshendi won’t\nbe able to surround that large a force, and even if they did, it wouldn’t\nmatter. We’d be able to stand against them.”\n“We can leave right after the final highstorm before the Weeping,”\nNavani said, writing some numbers on the side of the map. “It is the Light\nYear, and so we’ll have steady rains, but no highstorms for weeks. We\nwon’t be exposed to one while out on the Plains.”\nIt would also put them out on the Shattered Plains, alone, within days of\nthe date that had been scratched on the walls and floor… Adolin’s spine\ncrawled.\n“We have to beat them to it,” Dalinar said softly, scanning the maps.\n“Interrupt whatever it is they are planning. Before the countdown ends.” He\nlooked up at Adolin. “I need you to duel more. High-profile matches, as\nhigh profile as you can manage. Win Shards for me, son.”\n“I’m dueling Elit tomorrow,” Adolin said. “From there, I have a plan for\nmy next target.”\n“Good. To succeed out on the Plains, we will need Shardbearers—and\nwe will need the loyalty of as many highprinces as will follow me. Focus\nyour dueling on the Shardbearers of the faction loyal to Sadeas, and beat\nthem with as much fanfare as you can manage. I will go to the neutral\nhighprinces, and will remind them of their oaths to fulfill the Vengeance\nPact. If we can take Shards from those who follow Sadeas and use them to\nend the war, it will go a long way toward proving what I’ve been saying all\nalong. That unity is the path to Alethi greatness.”\nAdolin nodded. “I’ll see it done.”\n52.

Puddles still\nlingered in low spots from the previous day’s highstorm, fat with crem for\nthe plants to feast upon. To his left, Kaladin heard the sounds of the\nwarcamps, busy with activity. To the right… silence. Just those endless\nplateaus.\nWhen he’d been a bridgeman, Sadeas’s troops hadn’t stopped him from\nwalking this path. What was there for men out here, on the Plains? Instead,\nSadeas had posted guards at the edges of the camps and at bridges, so the\nslaves couldn’t escape.\nWhat was there for men out here? Nothing but salvation itself,\ndiscovered in the depths of those chasms.\nKaladin turned and strolled out along one of the chasms, passing\nsoldiers on guard duty at bridges, torches shivering in the wind. They\nsaluted him.\nThere, he thought, picking his way along a particular plateau. The\nwarcamps to his left stained the air with light, enough to see where he was.\nAt the plateau’s edge he came to the place where he had met with the\nKing’s Wit on that night weeks ago. A night of decision, a night of change.\nKaladin stepped up to the edge of the chasm, looking eastward.\nChange and decision. He checked over his shoulder. He’d passed the\nguard post, and now nobody was close enough to see him. So, belt laden\nwith bags of spheres, Kaladin stepped off into the chasm.\n* * *\nShallan did not care for Sadeas’s warcamp.\nThe air was different here than it was in Sebarial’s camp. It stank, and it\nsmelled of desperation.\nWas desperation even a smell? She thought she could describe it. The\nscent of sweat, of cheap drink, and of crem that had not been cleaned off the\nstreets. That all churned above roads that were poorly lit. In Sebarial’s\ncamp, people walked in groups. Here, they loped along in packs.\nSebarial’s camp smelled of spice and industry—of new leather and,\nsometimes, livestock. Dalinar’s camp smelled of polish and oil. Around\nevery second corner in Dalinar’s camp, someone was doing something\npractical. There were too few soldiers in Dalinar’s camp these days, but\neach wore his uniform, as if it were a shield against the chaos of the times.\nIn Sadeas’s camp, the men who wore their uniforms wore them with\nunbuttoned jackets and wrinkled trousers. She passed tavern after tavern,\neach spitting forth a racket. The women who idled in front of some\nindicated that not all were simply taverns. Whorehouses were common in\nevery camp, of course, but they seemed more blatant here.\nShe passed fewer parshmen than she commonly saw in Sebarial’s camp.\nSadeas preferred traditional slaves: men and women with branded\nforeheads, scurrying about with backs bowed and shoulders slumped.\nThis was, honestly, what she’d expected from all of the warcamps.\nShe’d read accounts of men at war—of camp followers and discipline\nproblems.

Perhaps, instead of wondering at the awfulness of Sadeas’s camp, she\nshould be marveling that the others weren’t the same.\nShallan hurried on her way. She wore the face of a young darkeyed\nman, her hair pushed up into her cap. She wore a pair of sturdy gloves.\nEven disguised as a boy, she wasn’t about to go around with her safehand\nexposed.\nBefore leaving tonight, she had done a series of sketches to use as new\nfaces, if need be. Testing had proven she could draw a sketch in the\nmorning, then use it for an image in the afternoon. If she waited longer than\nabout a day, though, the image she created was blurred and sometimes\nlooked melted. That made perfect sense to Shallan. The process of creation\nleft a picture in her mind that eventually wore thin.\nHer current face had been based on the messenger youths who moved in\nSadeas’s camp. Though her heart thumped every time she passed a pack of\nsoldiers, nobody gave her a second glance.\nAmaram was a highlord—a man of third dahn, which made him a full\nrank higher than Shallan’s father had been, two ranks higher than Shallan\nherself. That entitled him to his own little domain within his liege’s\nwarcamp. His manor flew his own banner, and he had his own personal\nmilitary force occupying nearby buildings. Posts set into the stone and\nstriped with his colors—burgundy and forest green—delineated his sphere\nof influence. She passed them without pausing.\n“Hey, you!”\nShallan froze in place, feeling very small in the darkness. Not small\nenough. She turned slowly as a pair of patrolling guards walked up. Their\nuniforms were sharper than any she’d seen in this camp. Even the buttons\nwere polished, though at the waists they wore skirtlike takama instead of\ntrousers. Amaram was a traditionalist, and his uniforms reflected that.\nThe guards loomed over her, as most Alethi did. “Messenger?” one\nasked. “This time of night?” He was a solid fellow with a greying beard and\na thick, wide nose.\n“It’s not even second moon yet, sir,” Shallan said in what she hoped was\na boyish voice.\nHe frowned at her. What had she said? Sir, she realized. He’s not an\nofficer.\n“Report at the guard posts from now on when you visit,” the man said,\npointing toward a small, lit area in the distance behind them. “We’re going\nto start keeping a secure perimeter.”\n“Yes, Sergeant.”\n“Oh, stop harassing the lad, Hav,” the other soldier said. “You can’t\nexpect him to know rules that half the soldiers don’t even know yet.”\n“On with you,” Hav said, waving Shallan through. She hastened to\nobey. A secure perimeter? She didn’t envy these men that task. Amaram\ndidn’t have a wall to keep people out, just some striped posts.\nAmaram’s manor was relatively small—two stories, with a handful of\nrooms on each floor.

It might once have been a tavern, and was temporary,\nas he’d only just arrived at the warcamps. Stacked piles of crembrick and\nstone nearby indicated some far grander building was being planned. Near\nthe piles stood other buildings that had been appropriated as barracks for\nAmaram’s personal guard, which included only about fifty men. Most of the\nsoldiers he’d brought, recruited from Sadeas’s lands and sworn to him,\nwould billet elsewhere.\nOnce she got close to Amaram’s home, she ducked beside an\noutbuilding and squatted down. She’d spent three evenings scouting this\narea, wearing a different face each time. Perhaps that had been overly\ncautious. She wasn’t certain. She’d never done anything like this before.\nFingers trembling, she took off her cap—that part of the costume was real\n—and let her hair spill around her shoulders. Then she dug a folded picture\nout of her pocket and waited.\nMinutes passed as she stared at the manor. Come on… she thought.\nCome on…\nFinally, a young darkeyed woman stepped out of the manor, arm-in-arm\nwith a tall man in trousers and a loose buttoned shirt. The woman tittered as\nher friend said something, then she scampered off into the night, the man\ncalling after her and following. The maid—Shallan still hadn’t been able to\nlearn her name—left every night at this time. Twice with this man. Once\nwith another.\nShallan took a deep breath, drawing in Stormlight, then held up the\npicture she’d drawn of the girl earlier. About Shallan’s height, hair about the\nsame length, similar enough build… It would have to do. She breathed out,\nand became someone else.\nShe giggles and laughs, Shallan thought, plucking off her masculine\ngloves and replacing the one on the safehand with a tan feminine one, and\noften prances about, walking on her toes. Her voice is higher than mine,\nand she doesn’t have an accent.\nShallan had practiced sounding right, but hopefully she wouldn’t need\nto find out how believable her voice was. All she had to do was go in the\ndoor, up the stairs, and slip into the appropriate room. Easy.\nShe stood up, holding her breath and living off the Stormlight, and\nstrode toward the building.\n* * *\nKaladin hit the bottom of the chasm in a glowing storm of Light. He\ntook off at a jog, spear over his shoulder. It was difficult to stand still with\nStormlight in his veins.\nHe dropped a few of the pouches of spheres to use later. The Stormlight\nrising from his exposed skin was enough to illuminate the chasm, and it cast\nshadows on the walls as he ran. Those seemed to become figures, crafted by\nthe bones and branches stretching from the heaps on the ground. Bodies and\nsouls. His movement made the shadows twist, as if turning to regard him.\nHe ran with a silent audience, then. Syl flew down as a ribbon of light\nand took up position beside his head, matching his speed. He leaped over\nobstacles and splashed through puddles, letting his muscles warm to the\nexercise.\nThen he jumped up onto the wall."

She put\nhands on her hips.\n“What?” he asked.\n“That was pathetic.”\n“Agreed.”\n“Maybe you’re taking it a little too quickly,” she said. “Why not try to\njump onto the wall without a running start?”\n“The assassin could do it this way,” Kaladin said. “I need to be able to\nfight like he does.”\n“I see. And I suppose he started doing all of this the moment he was\nborn, without any practice at all.”\nKaladin exhaled softly. “You sound like Tukks used to.”\n“Oh? Was he brilliant, beautiful, and always right?”\n“He was loud, intolerant, and profoundly acerbic,” Kaladin said,\nstanding up. “But yes, he was basically always right.” He faced the wall and\nleaned his spear against it. “Szeth called this ‘Lashing.’”\n“A good term,” Syl said, nodding.\n“Well, to get this down, I’m going to have to practice some\nfundamentals.” Just like learning a spear.\nThat probably meant hopping onto and off the wall a couple hundred\ntimes.\nBetter than dying on that assassin’s Shardblade, he thought, and got to\nit.\n* * *\nShallan stepped into Amaram’s kitchens, trying to move with the\nenergetic grace of the girl whose face she wore. The large room smelled\nstrongly of the curry simmering over the hearth—the remnants of the\nnight’s meal, waiting in case any lighteyes got peckish. The cook browsed a\nnovel in the corner while her girls scrubbed pots. The room was well lit\nwith spheres. Amaram apparently trusted his servants.\nA long flight of steps led up to the second floor, providing quick access\nfor servants to bring meals to Amaram. Shallan had drawn a layout of the\nbuilding from guesses based on window locations. The room with the\nsecrets had been easy to locate—Amaram had the windows shuttered, and\nnever opened them. She’d guessed right about the stairwell in the kitchens,\nit seemed. She strode toward those steps, humming to herself, as the woman"

She strode toward those steps, humming to herself, as the woman\nshe imitated often did.\n“Back already?” the cook said, not looking up from her novel. She was\nHerdazian, from the accent. “His gift tonight wasn’t nice enough? Or did\nthe other one spot you two together?”\nShallan said nothing, trying to cover her anxiety with the humming.\n“Might as well put you to use,” the cook said. “Stine wanted someone to\npolish mirrors for him. He’s in the study, cleaning the master’s flutes.”\nFlutes? A soldier like Amaram had flutes?\nWhat would the cook do if Shallan bolted up the stairs and ignored the\norder? The woman was probably high ranked for a darkeyes. An important\nmember of the household staff.\nThe cook didn’t look up from her novel, but continued softly. “Don’t\nthink we haven’t noticed you sneaking off during midday, child. Just\nbecause the master is fond of you doesn’t mean you can take advantage. Go\nto work. Spending your free evening cleaning instead of playing might\nremind you that you have duties.”\nGritting her teeth, Shallan looked up those steps toward her goal. The\ncook slowly lowered her novel. Her frown seemed the type that one didn’t\ndisobey.\nShallan nodded, moving away from the steps and into the corridor\nbeyond. There would be another set of steps upward in the front hall. She’d\njust have to make her way in that direction and—\nShallan froze in place as a figure stepped into the hallway from a side\nroom. Tall with a square face and angular nose, the man wore a lighteyed\noutfit of modern design: an open jacket over a buttoned shirt, stiff trousers,\na stock tied in place at his neck.\nStorms! Highlord Amaram—fashionable or otherwise—was not\nsupposed to be in the building today. Adolin had said that Amaram was\ndining with Dalinar and the king tonight. Why was he here?\nAmaram stood looking over a ledger in his hand, and didn’t seem to\nhave noticed her. He turned away from her and strolled down the corridor.\nRun. It was her immediate reaction. Escape out the front doors, vanish\ninto the night. The problem was, she’d spoken to the cook. When the\nwoman Shallan was imitating came back later, she’d be in a storm of\ntrouble—and she’d be able to prove, with witnesses, that she hadn’t come\nback into the house earlier. Whatever Shallan did, there was a good chance\nthat once she was gone, Amaram would find out that someone had been\nsneaking about, imitating one of his maids.\nStormfather! She’d only just stepped into the building, and already\nshe’d messed everything up.\nStairs creaked up ahead. Amaram was going up to his room, the one\nShallan was supposed to inspect.\nThe Ghostbloods will be mad at me for alerting Amaram, Shallan\nthought, but they’ll be even angrier if I do that and then return with no\ninformation.\nShe had to get into that room, alone. That meant she couldn’t let\nAmaram enter it."

Amaram reached the\ntop landing and turned toward the hallway. Maybe he wouldn’t go in that\nroom.\nShe wasn’t so lucky. As Shallan scurried up the steps, Amaram turned\ntoward just that door and raised a key, slipping it into the lock and turning\nit.\n“Brightlord Amaram,” Shallan said, out of breath as she reached the top\nlanding.\nHe turned toward her, frowning. “Telesh? Weren’t you going out\ntonight?”\nWell, at least she knew her name now. Did Amaram really take such an\ninterest in his servants as to be aware of a lowly maid’s evening plans?\n“I did, Brightlord,” Shallan said, “but I came back.”\nNeed a distraction. But not something too suspicious. Think! Was he\ngoing to notice that the voice was different?\n“Telesh,” Amaram said, shaking his head. “You still can’t choose\nbetween them? I promised your good father I’d see you cared for. How can\nI do that if you won’t settle down?”\n“It’s not that, Brightlord,” Shallan said quickly. “Hav stopped a\nmessenger on the perimeter coming for you. He sent me back to tell you.”\n“Messenger?” Amaram said, slipping the key back out of the lock.\n“From whom?”\n“Hav didn’t say, Brightlord. He seemed to think it was important,\nthough.”\n“That man…” Amaram said with a sigh. “He’s too protective. He thinks\nhe can keep a tight perimeter in this mess of a camp?” The highlord\nconsidered, then stuffed the key back in his pocket. “Better see what it’s\nabout.”\nShallan gave him a bow as he passed her by and trotted down the stairs.\nShe counted to ten once he was out of sight, then scrambled to the door. It\nwas still locked.\n“Pattern!” Shallan whispered. “Where are you?”\nHe came out from the folds of her skirts, moving across the floor and\nthen up the door until he was just before her, like a raised carving on the\nwood.\n“The lock?” Shallan asked.\n“It is a pattern,” he said, then grew very small and moved into the\nkeyhole. She’d had him try a few more times on locks back in her rooms,\nand he’d been able to unlock those as he had Tyn’s trunk.\nThe lock clicked, and she opened the door and slipped into the dark\nroom. A sphere plucked from her dress pocket lit it for her.\nThe secret room. The room with shutters always closed, kept locked at\nall times. A room that the Ghostbloods wanted so desperately to see.\nIt was filled with maps.\n* * *\nThe trick to jumping between surfaces wasn’t the landing, Kaladin\ndiscovered.

It wasn’t even about\nchanging perspective.\nIt was about fear.\nIt was about that moment when, hanging in the air, his body lurched\nfrom being pulled down to being pulled sideways. His instincts weren’t\nequipped to deal with this shift. A primal part of him panicked every time\ndown stopped being down.\nHe ran at the wall and jumped, throwing his feet to the side. He couldn’t\nhesitate, couldn’t be afraid, couldn’t flinch. It was like teaching himself to\ndive face-first onto a stone surface without raising his hands for protection.\nHe shifted his perspective and used Stormlight to make the wall become\ndownward. He positioned his feet. Even still, in that brief moment, his\ninstincts rebelled. The body knew, it knew, that he was going to fall back to\nthe chasm floor. He would break bones, hit his head.\nHe landed on the wall without stumbling.\nKaladin stood up straight, surprised, and exhaled a deep breath, puffing\nwith Stormlight.\n“Nice!” Syl said, zipping around him.\n“It’s unnatural,” Kaladin said.\n“No. I could never be involved in anything unnatural. It’s just…\nextranatural.”\n“You mean supernatural.”\n“No I don’t.” She laughed and zipped on ahead of him.\nIt was unnatural—as walking wasn’t natural for a child who was just\nlearning. It became natural over time. Kaladin was learning to crawl—and\nunfortunately, he’d soon be required to run. Like a child dropped in a\nwhitespine’s lair. Learn quickly or be lunch.\nHe ran along the wall, hopping over a shalebark outcropping, then\njumped to the side and shifted to the floor of the chasm. He landed with\nonly a slight stumble.\nBetter. He ran after Syl and kept at it.\n* * *\nMaps.\nShallan crept forward, her solitary sphere revealing a room draped with\nmaps and strewn with papers. They were covered in glyphs that had been\nscribbled quickly, not made to be beautiful. She could barely read most of\nthem.\nI’ve heard of this, she thought. The stormwarden script. The way they\nget around the restrictions on writing.\nAmaram was a stormwarden? A chart of times on one wall, listing\nhighstorms and calculations of their next arrival—written in the same hand\nas the notes on the maps—seemed proof of that. Perhaps this was what the\nGhostbloods were seeking: blackmail material. Stormwardens, as male\nscholars, made most people uncomfortable. Their use of glyphs in a way\nthat was basically the same as writing, their secretive nature… Amaram was\none of the most accomplished generals in all of Alethkar. He was respected\neven by those he fought. Exposing him as a stormwarden could seriously\ndamage his reputation.\nWhy would he bother with such strange hobbies? All of these maps\nfaintly reminded her of the ones she’d discovered in her father’s study, after\nhis death—though those had been of Jah Keved. “Watch outside, Pattern,”\nshe said. “Bring me word quickly when Amaram returns to the building.”\n“Mmmm,” he buzzed, withdrawing.\nAware that her time was short, Shallan hurried to the wall, holding up"

The Shattered Plains? This\nmap was far more extensive than any she’d seen before—and that included\nthe Prime Map that she’d studied in the king’s Gallery of Maps.\nHow had Amaram obtained something so extensive? She tried to work\nout the use of glyphs—there was no grammar to them that she could see.\nGlyphs weren’t meant to be used that way. They conveyed a single idea, not\na string of thoughts. She read a few in a row.\nOrigin… direction… uncertainty… The place of the center is uncertain?\nThat was probably what it meant.\nOther notes were similar, and she translated in her head. Perhaps\npushing this direction will yield results. Warriors spotted watching from\nhere. Other groupings of glyphs made no sense to her. This script was\nbizarre. Perhaps Pattern could translate it, but she certainly couldn’t.\nAside from the maps, the walls were covered in long sheets of paper\nfilled with writing, figures, and diagrams. Amaram was working on\nsomething, something big—\nParshendi! she realized. That’s what those glyphs mean. Parap-shenesh-\nidi. The three glyphs individually meant three separate things—but together,\ntheir sounds made the word “Parshendi.” That was why some of the\nwritings seemed like gibberish. Amaram was using some glyphs\nphonetically. He underlined them when he did this, and that allowed him to\nwrite in glyphs things that never should have worked. The stormwardens\nreally were turning glyphs into a full script.\nParshendi, she translated, still distracted by the nature of the characters,\nmust know how to return the Voidbringers.\nWhat?\nRemove secret from them.\nReach center before Alethi armies.\nSome of the writings were lists of references. Though they’d been\ntranslated to glyphs, she recognized some of the quotes from Jasnah’s work.\nThey referred to the Voidbringers. Others were purported sketches of\nVoidbringers and other creatures of mythology.\nThis was it, full proof that the Ghostbloods were interested in the same\nthings Jasnah was. As was Amaram, apparently. Heart beating with\nexcitement, Shallan turned around, looking over the room. Was the secret to\nUrithiru here? Had he found it?\nThere was too much for Shallan to translate fully at the moment. The\nscript was too difficult, and her thumping heart made her too nervous.\nBesides, Amaram would likely return very soon. She took Memories so she\ncould sketch this all out later.\nAs she did, the writings she translated in passing caused a new species\nof dread to rise within her. It seemed… it seemed that Highlord Amaram—\nparagon of Alethi honor—was actively trying to bring about the return of\nthe Voidbringers.\nI have to stay a part of this, Shallan thought. I can’t afford to have the\nGhostbloods cast me out for making a mess of this incursion. I need to\ndiscover what else they know.

Again and again, sucking in Stormlight.\nYes, this was natural. Yes, this was him.\nHe continued running along the chasm bottom, feeling a surge of\nexcitement. Shadows waved him on as he dodged between piles of bone\nand moss. He leaped over a large pool of water, but misjudged its size. He\ncame down—about to splash into the shallow water.\nBut by reflex, he looked upward and Lashed himself toward the sky.\nFor a brief moment, Kaladin stopped falling down and fell up instead.\nHis momentum continued forward, and he cleared the pool, then Lashed\nhimself downward again. He landed in a trot, sweating.\nI could Lash myself upward, he thought, and fall into the sky forever.\nBut no, that was how an ordinary person thought. A skyeel didn’t fear\nfalling, did it? A fish didn’t fear drowning.\nUntil he began thinking in a new way, he wouldn’t control this gift he\nhad been given. And it was a gift. He would embrace this.\nThe sky was now his.\nKaladin shouted, dashing forward. He leaped and Lashed himself to the\nwall. No pausing, no hesitance, no fear. He hit at a dead run, and nearby,\nSyl laughed for joy.\nBut that, that was simple. Kaladin jumped off the wall and looked\ndirectly above him at the opposite wall. He Lashed himself in that direction,\nand flung his body into a flip. He landed, going down on one knee upon\nwhat had been the ceiling to him a moment before.\n“You did it!” Syl said, flitting around him. “What changed?”\n“I did.”\n“Well, yeah, but what about you?” Syl asked.\n“Everything.”\nShe frowned at him. He grinned back, then took off at a run along the\nside of the chasm.\n* * *\nShallan strode down the mansion’s back steps to the kitchen, thumping\neach foot down harder than it would normally fall, trying to imitate being\nheavier than she was.

Do you\nunderstand?”\nThe cook grew pale, and nodded her head, sinking down in her chair.\nShallan nodded to her curtly, then walked from the kitchens out into the\nnight. There, she ducked to the side of the building, heart pounding. A grin\nformed on her face anyway.\nOut of sight, she exhaled Stormlight in a cloud, then stepped forward.\nAs she passed through it, the image of Amaram vanished, replaced by that\nof the messenger boy she’d been imitating before.

She would\nlike to schedule a time to come and do a sketch of yours, if you are\nwilling.”\n“Oh,” Amaram said. He seemed to relax. “Yes, well, that would be fine.\nI am free most afternoons. Have her send someone to speak with my\nsteward to arrange a meeting.”\n“Yes, Highlord. I’ll see that it is done.” Shallan moved to leave.\n“You came this late?” Amaram asked. “To ask such a simple question.”\nShallan shrugged. “I don’t question the commands of lighteyes,\nHighlord.

Shallan hesitated. A sword formed\nin his hand, mist coalescing, water beading on its surface. Amaram held it\nup, looking at himself in the reflection.\n“Such beauty,” he said. “Such art. Why must we kill with our grandest\ncreations? Ah, but I’m babbling, delaying you. I apologize. The Blade is\nstill new to me. I find excuses to summon it.”\nShallan was barely listening. A Blade with the back edge ridged like\nflowing waves. Or perhaps tongues of fire. Etchings all along its surface.\nCurved, sinuous.\nShe knew this Blade.\nIt belonged to her brother Helaran.\n* * *\nKaladin charged through the chasm, and the wind joined him, blowing\nat his back. Syl soared before him as a ribbon of light.\nHe reached a boulder in his way and jumped into the air, Lashing\nhimself upward. He soared a good thirty feet upward before Lashing\nhimself to the side and downward at the same time. The downward Lashing\nslowed his momentum upward; the sideways Lashing brought him to the\nwall.\nHe dismissed the downward Lashing and hit the wall with one hand,\ntwisting and throwing himself to his feet. He kept running along the chasm\nwall. When he reached the end of the plateau, he leaped toward the next one\nand Lashed himself at its wall instead.\nFaster! He held nearly all of the Stormlight he had left, fetched from the\npouches he’d dropped earlier. He held so much that he glowed like a\nbonfire. It encouraged him as he jumped and Lashed himself forward,\neastward. This made him fall through the chasm. The floor of the chasm\nwhipped along beneath him, plants a blur to his sides.\nHe had to remember that he was falling. This was not flight, and every\nsecond he moved, his speed increased. That didn’t stop the feeling of\nliberty, of ultimate freedom. It just meant this could be dangerous.\nThe winds picked up and he Lashed himself backward at the last\nmoment, slowing his descent as he crashed against a chasm wall before\nhim.\nThat direction was down to him now, so he stood and ran along it. He\nwas using the Stormlight at a furious rate, but he didn’t need to scrimp. He\nwas paid like a lighteyed officer of the sixth dahn, and his spheres held not\ntiny chips of gemstone, but broams. A month’s pay for him now was more\nthan he had ever seen at a time, and the Stormlight it held was a vast fortune\ncompared to what he’d once known.\nHe shouted as he jumped a group of frillblooms, their fronds pulling in\nbeneath him. He Lashed himself to the other chasm wall and crossed the\nchasm, landing on his hands. He threw himself back upward, and somehow\nLashed himself only slightly in that direction."

This was his ocean to swim, his winds upon which to\nsoar. He fell face-first toward the next plateau. Just before he arrived, he\nLashed himself sideways and backward.\nHis stomach lurched. He felt like someone had tied a rope around him\nand pushed him off a cliff, then yanked on the rope right as he reached the\nend of it. The Stormlight inside, however, made the discomfort negligible.\nHe pulled sideways, into another chasm.\nLashings sent him eastward again down another corridor, and he wove\naround plateaus, keeping to the chasms—like an eel swimming through the\nwaves, swerving around boulders. Onward, faster, still falling…\nTeeth clenched at both the wonder and the forces twisting him, he\ntossed caution aside and Lashed himself upward. Once, twice, three times.\nHe let go of all else, and amid the streaming Light, he shot from the chasms\nout into the open air above.\nHe Lashed himself back to the east so that he could fall in that direction\nagain, but now no plateau walls got in his way. He soared toward the\nhorizon, distant, lost in the darkness. He gained speed, coat flapping, hair\nwhipping behind him. Air buffeted his face, and he narrowed his eyes, but\ndid not close them.\nBeneath, dark chasms passed one after another. Plateau. Pit. Plateau. Pit.\nThis sensation… flying over the land… he had felt this before, in dreams.\nWhat took bridgemen hours to cross, he passed in minutes. He felt as if\nsomething were boosting him from behind, the wind itself carrying him. Syl\nzipped along to his right.\nAnd to his left? No, those were other windspren. He’d accumulated\ndozens of them, flying around him as ribbons of light. He could pick out\nSyl. He didn’t know how; she didn’t look different, but he could tell. Like\nyou could pick a family member out of a crowd just by their walk.\nSyl and her cousins twisted around him in a spiral of light, free and\nloose, but with a hint of coordination.\nHow long had it been since he felt this good, this triumphant, this alive?\nNot since before Tien’s death. Even after saving Bridge Four, darkness had\nshadowed him.\nThat evaporated. He saw a spire of rock ahead on the plateaus, and\nnudged himself toward it with a careful Lashing to the right. Other Lashings\nto his rear slowed his fall enough that when he hit the tip of the spire of\nrock, he could clutch to it and spin around it, fingers on the smooth\ncremstone."

She finally knew\nwhat had happened to Helaran.\nYou were involved in all of this, weren’t you, Helaran? she thought. Just\nlike Father was.

He was still Lashed to the sky; he hadn’t dismissed the upward\nLashings.\nCurious, he Lashed himself downward to slow further, then dismissed\nall of his Lashings except one up and one down. He eventually came to a\nstop hanging in midair. The second moon had risen, bathing the Plains in\nlight far below. From here, they looked like a broken plate. No… he\nthought, squinting. It’s a pattern. He’d seen this before. In a dream.\nWind blew against him, causing him to drift like a kite. The windspren\nhe’d attracted scampered away now that he wasn’t riding upon the winds.\nFunny. He’d never realized one could attract windspren as one attracted the\nspren of emotions.\nAll you had to do was fall into the sky.\nSyl remained, spinning around him in a swirl until finally coming to rest\non his shoulder. She sat, then looked down.\n“Not many men ever see this view,” she noted. From up here, the\nwarcamps—circles of fire to his right—seemed insignificant. It was cold\nenough to be uncomfortable. Rock claimed the air was thinner up high,\nthough Kaladin couldn’t tell any difference.\n“I’ve been trying to get you to do this for a while now,” Syl said.\n“It’s like when I first picked up a spear,” Kaladin whispered. “I was just\na child. Were you with me back then? All that time ago?”\n“No,” Syl said, “and yes.”\n“It can’t be both.”\n“It can. I knew I needed to find you. And the winds knew you. They led\nme to you.”\n“So everything I’ve done,” Kaladin said. “My skill with the spear, the\nway I fight. That’s not me. It’s you.”\n“It’s us.”\n“It’s cheating. Unearned.”\n“Nonsense,” Syl said. “You practice every day.”\n“I have an advantage.”\n“The advantage of talent,” Syl said. “When the master musician first\npicks up an instrument and finds music in it that nobody else can, is that\ncheating? Is that art unearned, just because she is naturally more skilled? Or\nis it genius?”\nKaladin Lashed himself westward, back toward the warcamps. He\ndidn’t want to leave himself stranded in the middle of the Shattered Plains\nwithout Stormlight. The tempest within had calmed greatly since he started.\nHe fell in that direction for a time—getting as close as he dared before\nslowing himself—then removed part of the upward Lashing and began to\ndrift downward.\n“I’ll take it,” Kaladin said. “Whatever it is that gives me that edge. I’ll\nuse it. I’ll need it to beat him.”\nSyl nodded, still sitting on his shoulder.\n“You don’t think he has a spren,” Kaladin said. “But how does he do\nwhat he does?”\n“The weapon,” Syl said, more confidently than she had before. “It’s\nsomething special. It was created to give abilities to men, much as our bond\ndoes.”"

It was created to give abilities to men, much as our bond\ndoes.”\nKaladin nodded, light wind ruffling his jacket as he fell through the\nnight. “Syl…” How to broach this? “I can’t fight him without a\nShardblade.”\nShe looked the other way, squeezing her arms together, hugging herself.\nSuch human gestures.\n“I’ve avoided the training with the Blades that Zahel offers,” Kaladin\ncontinued. “It’s hard to justify. I need to learn how to use one of those\nweapons.”\n“They’re evil,” she said in a small voice.\n“Because they’re symbols of the knights’ broken oaths,” Kaladin said.\n“But where did they come from in the first place? How were they forged?”\nSyl didn’t answer.\n“Can a new one be forged? One that doesn’t bear the stain of broken\npromises?”\n“Yes.”\n“How?”\nShe didn’t reply. They floated downward for a time in silence until\ngently coming to rest on a dark plateau. Kaladin got his bearings, then\nwalked over and drifted off the edge, going down into the chasms. He\nwouldn’t want to walk back using the bridges. The scouts would find it odd\nthat he was coming back without having gone out.\nStorms. They’d have seen him flying out here, wouldn’t they? What\nwould they think? Were any close enough to have seen him land?\nWell, he couldn’t do anything about that now. He reached the bottom of\nthe chasm and started walking back toward the warcamps, his Stormlight\nslowly dying out, leaving him in darkness. He felt deflated without it,\nsluggish, tired.\nHe fished the last infused sphere from his pocket and used it to light his\npath.\n“There’s a question you’re avoiding,” Syl said, landing on his shoulder.\n“It’s been two days. When are you going to tell Dalinar about those men\nthat Moash took you to meet?”\n“He didn’t listen when I told him about Amaram.”\n“This is obviously different,” Syl said.\nIt was, and she was right. So why hadn’t he told Dalinar?\n“Those men didn’t seem the type who would wait long,” Syl said.\n“I’ll do something about them,” Kaladin said. “I just want to think about\nit some more. I don’t want Moash to get caught in the storm when we bring\nthem down.”\nShe fell silent as he walked the rest of the way, retrieving his spear, then\nclimbed the ladder up onto the plateaus. The sky overhead had grown\ncloudy, but the weather had been turning toward spring lately.\nEnjoy it while you can, he thought. The Weeping comes soon. Weeks of\nceaseless rain. No Tien to cheer him up. His brother had always been able\nto do that.\nAmaram had taken that from him. Kaladin lowered his head and started\nwalking. At the warcamps’ edge, he turned right and walked northward.\n“Kaladin?” Syl asked, flitting in beside him. “Why are you walking this\nway?”\nHe looked up. This was the way toward Sadeas’s camp. Dalinar’s camp\nwas the other direction.\nKaladin kept walking."

What are you doing?”\nFinally, he stopped in place. Amaram would be there, just ahead, inside\nSadeas’s camp somewhere. It was late, Nomon inching toward its zenith.\n“I could end him,” Kaladin said. “Enter his window in a flash of\nStormlight, kill him, and be off before anyone has time to react. So easy.\nEveryone would blame it on the Assassin in White.”\n“Kaladin…”\n“It’s justice, Syl,” he said, suddenly angry, turning toward her. “You tell\nme that I need to protect. If I kill him, that’s what I’m doing! Protecting\npeople, keeping him from ruining them. Like he ruined me.”\n“I don’t like how you get,” she said, seeming small, “when you think\nabout him. You stop being you. You stop thinking. Please.”\n“He killed Tien,” Kaladin said. “I will end him, Syl.”\n“But tonight?” Syl asked. “After what you just discovered, after what\nyou just did?”\nHe took a deep breath, remembering the thrill of the chasms and the\nfreedom of flight. He’d felt true joy for the first time in what seemed like\nages.\nDid he want to taint that memory with Amaram? No. Not even with the\nman’s demise, which would surely be a wonderful day.\n“All right,” he said, turning back toward Dalinar’s camp. “Not tonight.”\nEvening stew was finished by the time Kaladin arrived back at the\nbarracks. He passed the fire, where embers still glowed, and made his way\nto his room. Syl zipped up into the air. She’d ride the winds overnight,\nplaying with her cousins. So far as he knew, she didn’t need sleep.\nHe stepped into his private room, feeling tired and drained, but in a\npleasing way. It—\nSomeone stirred in the room.\nKaladin spun, leveling his spear, and sucked in the last light of the\nsphere he’d been using to guide his way. The Light that streamed off him\nrevealed a red and black face. Shen looked disturbingly eerie in those\nshadows, like an evil spren from the stories.\n“Shen,” Kaladin said, lowering his spear. “What in the—”\n“Sir,” Shen said. “I must leave.”\nKaladin frowned.\n“I am sorry,” Shen added speaking in his slow, deliberate way. “I cannot\ntell you why.” He seemed to be waiting for something, his hands tense on\nhis spear. The spear Kaladin had given him.\n“You’re a free man, Shen,” Kaladin said. “I won’t keep you here if you\nfeel you must go, but I don’t know that there is another place you can go\nwhere you will be able to make good on your freedom.”\nShen nodded, then moved to walk past Kaladin.\n“You are leaving tonight?”\n“Immediately.”\n“The guards at the edges of the Plains might try to stop you.”\nShen shook his head. “Parshmen do not flee captivity.

I will leave your spear beside the\nfire.” He walked to the door, but then hesitated beside Kaladin, and placed a\nhand on his shoulder. “You are a good man, Captain. I have learned much.\nMy name is not Shen. It is Rlain.”\n“May the winds treat you well, Rlain.”\n“The winds are not what I fear,” Rlain said. He patted Kaladin’s\nshoulder, then took a deep breath as if anticipating something difficult, and\nstepped from the chamber.\n53. Perfection\nAs to the other orders that were inferior in this\nvisiting of the far realm of spren, the Elsecallers\nwere prodigiously benevolent, allowing others as\nauxiliary to their visits and interactions; though\nthey did never relinquish their place as prime\nliaisons with the great ones of the spren; and the\nLightweavers and Willshapers both also had an\naffinity to the same, though neither were the true\nmasters of that realm.\nFrom Words of Radiance, chapter 6, page\n2\nAdolin slapped away Elit’s Shardblade with his forearm. Shardbearers\ndidn’t use shields—each section of Plate was stronger than stone.\nHe swept in, using Windstance as he moved across the sand of the\narena.\nWin Shards for me, son.\nAdolin flowed through the stance’s strikes, one direction then the other,\nforcing Elit away. The man scrambled, Plate leaking from a dozen places\nwhere Adolin had struck him.\nAny hope for a peaceful end to the war on the Shattered Plains was\ngone. Done for. He knew how much his father had wanted that end, and the\nParshendi arrogance made him angry. Frustrated.\nHe kept that down. He could not be consumed by it. He moved\nsmoothly through the stance, careful, maintaining a calm serenity.\nElit had apparently expected Adolin to be reckless, as in his first duel\nfor Shards. Elit kept backing up, waiting for that moment of recklessness.\nAdolin didn’t give it to him.\nToday, he fought with precision—exacting form and stance, nothing out\nof place. Downplaying his ability in his previous duel had not coaxed\nanyone powerful into agreeing to a bout. Adolin had barely persuaded Elit.\nTime for a different tactic.\nAdolin passed where Sadeas, Aladar, and Ruthar watched. The core of\nthe coalition against Father. By now, each of them had gone on plateau runs\nillicitly, getting to the plateau and stealing the gemheart before those\nassigned could arrive. Each time, they paid the fines Dalinar levied for their\ndisobedience. Dalinar couldn’t do anything more to them without risking\nopen war.\nBut Adolin could punish them in other ways.\nElit stumbled back, wary, as Adolin swept in. The man tested forward,\nand Adolin slapped the Blade away, then brought in a backhand and clipped\nElit’s forearm. It, too, started to leak Stormlight.\nThe crowd murmured, conversations rising over the arena. Elit came in\nagain, and Adolin slapped away his strikes, but did not counterattack."

Elit came in\nagain, and Adolin slapped away his strikes, but did not counterattack.\nIdeal form. Each step in place. The Thrill rose within him, but he\nshoved it down. He was disgusted by the highprinces and their squabbling,\nbut today he would not show them that fury. Instead, he’d show them\nperfection.\n“He’s trying to wear you down, Elit!” Ruthar’s voice from the stands\nnearby. In his younger years, he’d been something of a duelist himself,\nthough nowhere near as good as Dalinar or Aladar. “Don’t let him!”\nAdolin smiled inside his helm as Elit nodded and dashed forward in\nSmokestance, thrusting with his Blade. A gamble. Most contests against\nPlate were won by breaking sections, but at times you could drive the point\nof your Blade through a joint between plates, cracking them and scoring a\nhit.\nIt was also a way to try to wound your opponent, more than just defeat\nhim.\nAdolin calmly stepped back and used the proper Windstance sweeps for\nparrying a thrust. Elit’s weapon clanged away, and the crowd grumbled\nfurther. First, Adolin had given them a brutal show, which had annoyed\nthem. Then, he’d given them a close fight, with plenty of excitement.\nThis time, he did something opposite of both, refusing the exciting\nclashes that were often so much a part of a duel.\nHe stepped to the side and swung to score a slight hit on Elit’s helm. It\nleaked from a small crack. Not as much as it should, however.\nExcellent.\nElit growled audibly from within his helm, then came in with another\nthrust. Right at Adolin’s faceplate.\nTrying to kill me, are you? Adolin thought, taking one hand from his\nBlade and raising it just under Elit’s oncoming Blade, letting it slide\nbetween his thumb and forefinger.\nElit’s Blade ground along Adolin’s hand as he lifted upward and to the\nright. It was a move that you could never perform without Plate—you’d end\nwith your hand sliced in half if you tried that on a regular sword, worse if\nyou tried it on a Shardblade.\nWith Plate, he easily guided the thrust up past his head, then swept in\nwith his other hand, slamming his Blade against Elit’s side.\nSome in the crowd cheered at the straight-on blow. Others booed,\nhowever. The classical strike there would have been to hit Elit’s head, trying\nto shatter the helm.\nElit stumbled forward, knocked off balance by the missed thrust and\nsubsequent blow. Adolin heaved against him with a shoulder, throwing him\nto the ground. Then, instead of pouncing, he stepped backward.\nMore booing.\nElit stood up, then took a step. He lurched slightly, then took another\nstep. Adolin backed up and set his Blade with the point toward the ground,\nwaiting. Overhead, the sky rumbled. It would probably rain later today—\nnot a highstorm, thankfully. Just a mundane rainshower.\n“Fight me!” Elit shouted from within his helm.\n“I have.” Adolin replied quietly. “And I’ve won.”"

Adolin backed up. To the boos of the crowd, he\nwaited until Elit locked up completely—his Plate out of Stormlight. The\ndozens of small cracks Adolin had put in the man’s armor had finally added\nup.\nThen, Adolin strolled forward, placed a hand against Elit’s chest, and\nshoved him over. He crashed to the ground.\nAdolin looked up at Brightlady Istow, highjudge.\n“Judgment,” the highjudge said with a sigh, “again goes to Adolin\nKholin. The victor. Elit Ruthar forfeits his Plate.”\nThe crowd didn’t much like it. Adolin turned to face them, sweeping his\nBlade a few times before dismissing it to mist. He removed his helm and\nbowed to their boos. Behind, his armorers—whom he’d prepared for this—\nrushed out and pushed away those of Elit. They pulled off the Plate, which\nnow belonged to Adolin.\nHe smiled, and when they were done, followed them into the staging\nroom beneath the seats. Renarin waited by the door, wearing his own Plate,\nand Aunt Navani sat by the room’s brazier.\nRenarin peeked out at the dissatisfied crowds. “Stormfather. The first\nduel like this you did, you were done in under a minute, and they hated you.\nToday you were at it for the better part of an hour, and they seem to hate\nyou more.”\nAdolin sat down with a sigh on one of the benches. “I won.”\n“You did,” Navani said, stepping up, inspecting him as if for wounds.\nShe was always worried when he dueled. “But weren’t you supposed to do\nit with great fanfare?”\nRenarin nodded. “That’s what Father asked for.”\n“This will be remembered,” Adolin said, accepting a cup of water from\nPeet, one of the bridgeman guards for the day. He nodded thankfully.\n“Fanfare is about making everyone pay attention. This will work.”\nHe hoped. The next part was as important.\n“Aunt,” Adolin said as she started writing a prayer of thanks. “Have you\ngiven any thought to what I asked?”\nNavani kept drawing.\n“Shallan’s work really does sound important,” Adolin said. “I mean—”\nA knock came at the door to the chamber.\nSo quickly? Adolin thought, rising. One of the bridgemen opened the\ndoor.\nShallan Davar burst in, wearing a violet dress, red hair flaring as she\ncrossed the room. “That was incredible!”\n“Shallan!” She wasn’t the person he’d been expecting—but he wasn’t\nunhappy to see her. “I checked your seat before the fight and you weren’t\nthere.”\n“I forgot to burn a prayer,” she said, “so I stopped to do so.

They had only\nbeen officially courting for little more than a week, but with the causal in\nplace… what was their relationship?\nNavani cleared her throat. Shallan spun and raised her freehand to her\nlips, as if having only just noticed the former queen. “Brightness,” she said,\nand bowed.\n“Shallan,” Navani said. “I hear only good things from my nephew\nregarding you.”\n“Thank you.”\n“I will leave you two, then,” Navani said, walking toward the door, her\nglyphward unfinished.\n“Brightness…” Shallan said, raising a hand toward her.\nNavani left and pulled the door closed.\nShallan lowered her hand, and Adolin winced. “Sorry,” Adolin said.\n“I’ve been trying to talk to her about it. I think she needs a few more days,\nShallan. She’ll come around—she knows that she shouldn’t be ignoring\nyou, I can sense it. You just remind her of what happened.”\nShallan nodded, looking disappointed. Adolin’s armorers came over to\nhelp him remove his Plate, but he waved them away. It was bad enough to\nshow her his sloppy hair, plastered to his head from being in the helm. His\nclothing underneath—a padded uniform—would look awful.\n“So, uh, you liked the duel?” he asked.\n“You were wonderful,” Shallan said, turning back to him. “Elit kept\njumping at you, and you just brushed him off like an annoying cremling\ntrying to crawl up your leg.”\nAdolin grinned. “The rest of the crowd didn’t think it was wonderful.”\n“They came to see you get stomped,” she said. “You were so\ninconsiderate for not giving that to them.”\n“I’m quite stingy in that regard,” Adolin said.\n“You almost never lose, from what I’ve discovered. Awfully boring of\nyou. Maybe you should try for a tie now and then. For variety.”\n“I’ll consider it,” he said. “We can discuss it, perhaps over dinner this\nevening? At my father’s warcamp?”\nShallan grimaced. “I’m busy this evening. Sorry.”\n“Oh.”\n“But,” she said, stepping closer. “I might have a gift for you soon. I\nhaven’t had much time to study—I’ve been working hard to reconstruct\nSebarial’s house ledgers—but I might have stumbled upon something that\ncan help you. With your duels.”\n“What?” he asked, frowning.\n“I remembered something from King Gavilar’s biography. It would\nrequire you to win a duel in a spectacular way, though. Something amazing,\nsomething that would awe the crowd.”\n“Fewer boos, then,” Adolin said, scratching at his head.\n“I think everyone would appreciate that,” Renarin noted from beside the\ndoor.\n“Spectacular…” Adolin said.\n“I’ll explain more tomorrow,” Shallan said.\n“What happens tomorrow?”\n“You’re feeding me dinner.”\n“I am?”\n“And taking me on a walk,” she said.\n“I am?”\n“Yes.”\n“I’m a lucky man.” He smiled at her. “All right, then, we can—”\nThe door slammed open."

Relis, current dueling champion and Highprince\nRuthar’s eldest son.\nAs expected.\n“What,” Relis demanded, stalking into the room, “was that?” He was\nfollowed by a small gaggle of other lighteyes, including Brightlady Istow,\nthe highjudge. “You insult me and my house, Kholin.”\nAdolin clasped his gauntleted hands behind his back as Relis stalked\nright up to him, shoving his face into Adolin’s.\n“You didn’t like the duel?” Adolin asked casually.\n“That was not a duel,” Relis snapped. “You embarrassed my cousin by\nrefusing to fight properly. I demand that this farce be invalidated.”\n“I’ve told you, Prince Relis,” Istow said from behind. “Prince Adolin\ndidn’t break any—”\n“You want your cousin’s Plate back?” Adolin asked quietly, meeting\nRelis’s eyes. “Fight me for it.”\n“I won’t be goaded by you,” Relis said, tapping the center of Adolin’s\nbreastplate. “I won’t let you pull me into another of your dueling farces.”\n“Six Shards, Relis,” Adolin said. “Mine, those of my brother, Eranniv’s\nPlate, and your cousin’s Plate. I wager them all on a single bout. You and\nme.”\n“You are a dunnard if you think I’ll agree to that,” Relis snapped.\n“Too afraid?” Adolin asked.\n“You’re beneath me, Kholin. These last two fights prove it. You don’t\neven know how to duel anymore—all you know are tricks.”\n“Then you should be able to beat me easily.”\nRelis wavered, shifting from one foot to the other. Finally, he pointed at\nAdolin again. “You’re a bastard, Kholin. I know you fought my cousin to\nembarrass my father and myself. I refuse to be goaded.” He turned to leave.\nSomething spectacular, Adolin thought, glancing at Shallan. Father\nasked for fanfare…\n“If you’re afraid,” Adolin said, looking back to Relis, “you don’t have\nto duel me alone.”\nRelis stopped in place. He looked back. “Are you saying you’ll take me\non with anyone else at the same time?”\n“I am,” Adolin said. “I’ll fight you and whomever you bring, together.”\n“You are a fool,” Relis breathed.\n“Yes or no?”\n“Two days,” Relis snapped. “Here in the arena.” He looked to the\nhighjudge. “You witness this?”\n“I do,” she said.\nRelis stormed out. The others trailed after. The highjudge lingered,\nregarding Adolin. “You realize what you have done.”\n“I know the dueling conventions quite well. Yes. I’m aware.”\nShe sighed, but nodded, walking out."

Adolin sank back down\non the bench. “Will that do for spectacular?” he asked Shallan.\n“You really think you can beat two at once?” she asked.\nAdolin didn’t reply. Fighting two men at once was hard, particularly if\nthey were both Shardbearers. They could gang up on you, flank you,\nblindside you. It was far harder than fighting two in a row.\n“I don’t know,” he said. “But you wanted spectacular. So I’ll try for\nspectacular. Now, I hope you actually have a plan.”\nShallan sat down next to him. “What do you know of Highprince\nYenev… ?”\nShallan’s Sketchbook: Walks\n54. Veil’s Lesson\nThere came also sixteen of the order of\nWindrunners, and with them a considerable\nnumber of squires, and finding in that place the\nSkybreakers dividing the innocent from the guilty,\nthere ensued a great debate.\nFrom Words of Radiance, chapter 28, page\n3\nShallan stepped from the carriage into a light rainfall. She wore the\nwhite coat and trousers of the darkeyed version of herself that she’d named\nVeil. Rain sprinkled on the brim of her hat. She’d spent too long talking\nwith Adolin after his duel, and had needed to rush to make it to this\nappointment, which was happening in the Unclaimed Hills a good hour’s\nride out of the warcamps.\nBut she was here, in costume, on time. Barely. She strode forward,\nlistening to the rain patter on stone around her. She had always liked\nrainfalls like these. The younger sisters of highstorms, they brought life\nwithout the fury. Even the desolate stormlands here west of the warcamps\nbloomed with the advent of water. Rockbuds split, and though these didn’t\nhave blossoms like the ones back home, they did put out vibrant green\nvines. Grass rose thirstily from holes and refused to retreat until it was\npractically stepped on. Some reeds produced flowers to entice cremlings,\nwhich would feast upon the petals and in so doing rub themselves with\nspores that would give rise to the next generation, once mixed with the\nspores of other plants.\nIf she’d been at home, there would be far more vines—so many that it\nwould be hard to walk without tripping. Going out in a wooded area would\nrequire a machete to move more than a couple of feet. Here, the vegetation\nbecame colorful, but not an impediment.\nShallan smiled at the wonderful surroundings, the light rainfall, the\nbeautiful plant life. A little dampness was a small price to pay for the\nmelodious sound of sprinkling rain, for fresh clean air and a beautiful sky\nfull of clouds that varied in every shade of grey.\nShallan walked with a waterproof satchel under her arm, the hired\ncarriage driver—she couldn’t use Sebarial’s coach for today’s activity—"

        "text": "full of clouds that varied in every shade of grey.\nShallan walked with a waterproof satchel under her arm, the hired\ncarriage driver—she couldn’t use Sebarial’s coach for today’s activity—\nawaiting her return as she’d instructed. This coach was pulled by parshmen\ninstead of horses, but they were faster than chulls and had worked well\nenough.\nShe hiked toward a hillside ahead of her, the destination indicated on the\nmap she’d received via spanreed. She wore a nice pair of sturdy boots. This\nclothing of Tyn’s might be unusual, but Shallan was glad for it. The coat\nand hat kept off the rain, and the boots gave her sure footing on the slick\nrock.\nShe rounded the hill and found that it was broken on the other side, the\nrock having cracked and fallen in a small avalanche. The strata of hardened\ncrem were clearly visible on the edges of the chunks of rock, which meant\nthis was a newer fracture. If it had been old, new crem would have obscured\nthat coloring.\nThe crack made a small valley in the hillside—full of clefts and ridges\nfrom the crumbled rock. These had caught spores and windborne stems, and\nthat in turn had created an explosion of life. Wherever sheltered from the\nwind, plants would find purchase and start to grow.\nThe snarl of green grew haphazardly—this was not a true lait, where life\nwould be safe over time, but instead a temporary shelter, good for a few\nyears at most. For now, plants grew eagerly, sometimes atop one another,\nsprouting, blossoming, shaking, twisting, alive. It was an example of raw\nnature.\nThe pavilion, however, was not.\nIt covered four people who sat in chairs too fine for the surroundings.\nSnacking, they were warmed by a brazier at the center of the open-sided\ntent. Shallan approached, taking Memories of the people’s faces. She’d\ndraw those later, as she had done with the first group of the Ghostbloods\nshe’d met. Two of them were the same as last time. Two were not. The\ndiscomforting woman with the mask did not seem to be present.\nMraize, standing tall and proud, inspected his long blowgun. He did not\nlook up as Shallan stepped under the awning.\n“I like to learn to use the local weapons,” Mraize said. “It is a quirk,\nthough I feel it is justified. If you want to understand a people, learn their\nweapons. The way men kill one another says far more about a culture than\nany scholar’s ethnography.”\nHe raised his weapon toward Shallan, and she froze in place. Then he\nturned toward the crack and puffed, blowing a dart into the foliage.\nShallan stepped up beside him. The dart pinned a cremling to one of the\nplant stems. The small, many-legged creature spasmed and thrashed, trying\nto get free, though surely having a dart sticking through it would prove\nlethal.\n“This is a Parshendi blowgun,” Mraize noted. “What does it say about\nthem, do you suppose, little knife?”\n“It’s obviously not for killing big game,” Shallan said. “Which makes\nsense. The only big game I know of in the area are the chasmfiends, which"

        "text": "them, do you suppose, little knife?”\n“It’s obviously not for killing big game,” Shallan said. “Which makes\nsense. The only big game I know of in the area are the chasmfiends, which\nthe Parshendi are said to have worshipped as gods.”\nShe wasn’t convinced that they actually did. Early reports—which she’d\nread in detail at Jasnah’s insistence—made the assumption that the\nParshendi gods were the chasmfiends. It wasn’t actually clear.\n“They probably used it for stalking small game,” Shallan continued.\n“Which means they hunted for food, rather than pleasure.”\n“Why do you say this?” Mraize asked.\n“Men who glory in the hunt seek grand captures,” Shallan said.\n“Trophies. That blowgun is the weapon of a man who simply wants to feed\nhis family.”\n“And if he used it against other men?”\n“It wouldn’t be useful in war,” Shallan said. “Too short a range, I’d\nguess, and the Parshendi have bows anyway. Maybe this could be used in\nassassination, though I’d be very curious to discover if it was.”\n“And why is that?” Mraize asked.\nA test of some sort. “Well,” Shallan said, “most indigenous populations\n—the Silnasen natives, the Reshi peoples, the runners of the Iri plains—\nhave no real concept of assassination. From what I know, they don’t seem\nto have much use for battle at all. Hunters are too valuable, and so a ‘war’\nin these cultures will involve a lot of shouting and posturing, but few\ndeaths. That kind of boastful society doesn’t seem the type to have\nassassins.”\nAnd yet the Parshendi had sent one. Against the Alethi.\nMraize was studying her—watching her with unreadable eyes, long\nblowgun held lightly in his fingertips. “I see,” he finally said, “Tyn chose a\nscholar to be her apprentice this time around? I find that unusual.”\nShallan blushed. It occurred to her that this person she became when she\nput on the hat and dark hair was not an imitation of someone else, not a\ndifferent person. It was just a version of Shallan herself.\nThat could be dangerous.\n“So,” Mraize said, fishing another dart from his shirt pocket, “what\nexcuse did Tyn give you today?”\n“Excuse?” Shallan asked.\n“For failing in her mission.” Mraize loaded the dart.\nFailing? Shallan began to sweat, cold prickles on her forehead. But\nshe’d watched to see if anything out of the ordinary happened at Amaram’s\ncamp! This morning, she’d gone back—the real reason she’d been late to\nAdolin’s duel—while wearing the face of a worker. She’d listened to see if\nanyone spoke of a break-in, or of Amaram being suspicious. She’d found\nnothing.\nWell, obviously Amaram had not made his suspicions public. After all\nthe work she’d done to cover up her incursion, she had failed. She probably\nshouldn’t be surprised, but she was anyway.\n“I—” Shallan began.\n“I’m beginning to wonder if Tyn really is sick,” Mraize said, raising the\nblowgun and shooting another dart into the foliage. “To not even try to"

I have people watching that house. If she had…”\nHe trailed off as Shallan shook the water from her satchel, then\ncarefully undid it and lifted out a sheet of paper. It was a representation of\nAmaram’s locked room with its maps on the walls. She’d had to guess at\nsome of the details—it had been dark, and her single sphere hadn’t\nilluminated much—but she figured it was close enough.\nMraize took the picture from her and raised it. He studied it, leaving\nShallan to sweat nervously.\n“It is rare,” Mraize said, “that I am proven a fool. Congratulations.”\nWas that a good thing?\n“Tyn doesn’t have this skill,” Mraize continued, still inspecting the\nsheet. “You saw this room yourself?”\n“There is a reason that she chose a scholar as her assistant. My skills are\nmeant to complement her own.”\nMraize lowered the sheet. “Surprising. Your mistress might be a brilliant\nthief, but her choice of associates has always been unenlightened.” He had\nsuch a refined way of speaking. It didn’t seem to match his scarred face,\nmisaligned lip, and weathered hands. He talked like a man who had spent\nhis days sipping wine and listening to fine music, but he looked like\nsomeone who had repeatedly had his bones broken—and likely returned the\nfavor many times over.\n“Pity there is not more detail to these maps,” Mraize noted, inspecting\nthe picture again.\nShallan obligingly got out the other five pictures she’d drawn for him.\nFour were the maps on the walls in detail, the other a closer depiction of the\nwall scrolls with Amaram’s script. In each one, the actual writing was\nindecipherable, just wiggled lines. Shallan had done this on purpose.\nNobody would expect an artist to be able to capture such detail from\nmemory, even though she could.\nShe would keep the details of the script from them. She intended to gain\ntheir trust, to learn what she could, but she would not help them more than\nshe had to.\nMraize passed his blowgun to the side. The short, masked girl was\nthere, holding the cremling that Mraize had speared along with a dead\nmink, a blowgun dart in its neck. No, its leg twitched. It was merely\nstunned. Some poison on the dart, then?\nShallan shivered. Where had this woman been hiding? Those dark eyes\nstared at Shallan, unblinking, the rest of the face hidden behind the mask of\npaint and shell. She took the blowgun.\n“Amazing,” Mraize said of Shallan’s pictures. “How did you get in?

        "text": "watched the windows.”\nWas that how Tyn would have done it, sneaking in during the dead of\nnight through one of the windows? She hadn’t trained Shallan in that sort of\nthing, only accents and imitation. Perhaps she had spotted that Shallan, who\nsometimes stumbled over her own feet, would not be best at acrobatic\nlarceny.\n“These are masterful,” Mraize said, walking to a table and setting out\nthe pictures. “A triumph, certainly. Such artistry.”\nWhat had happened to the dangerous, emotionless man who had\nconfronted her at her first meeting with the Ghostbloods? Animated with\nemotion, he leaned down, studying the pictures one at a time. He even got\nout a magnifying glass in order to inspect the details.\nShe did not ask what she wondered. What is Amaram doing? Do you\nknow how he got his Shardblade? How he… killed Helaran Davar? Her\nbreath caught in her throat even still as she thought about it, but a part of\nher had admitted years ago that her brother wasn’t coming back.\nThat didn’t stop her from feeling a distinct, and surprising, hatred for\nthe man Meridas Amaram.\n“Well?” Mraize asked, glancing at her. “Come sit down, child. You did\nthis yourself?”\n“I did,” Shallan said, shoving down her emotions. Had Mraize just\ncalled her “child”? She’d intentionally made this version of her look older,\nwith a more angular face. What did she need to do? Start adding grey hairs\nto her head?\nShe settled into the seat beside the table. The woman with the mask\nappeared beside her, holding a cup and a kettle of something steaming.\nShallan nodded hesitantly, and was rewarded with a cup of mulled orange\nwine. She sipped it—she probably didn’t need to worry about poison, as\nthese people could have killed her at any time. The others under the\npavilion spoke with one another in hushed voices, but Shallan couldn’t\nmake out any of it. She felt like she was on display before an audience.\n“I copied some of the text for you,” Shallan said, fishing out one page\nof script. These were lines she had specifically chosen to show them—they\ndidn’t reveal too much, but might act as a primer to get Mraize talking\nabout the topic. “We didn’t have much time in the room, so I only got a few\nlines.”\n“You spent so long in there drawing the pictures, and so little recording\nthe text?” Mraize asked.\n“Oh,” Shallan said. “No, I did those pictures from memory.”\nHe looked up at her, jaw lowered a fraction, an expression of genuine\nsurprise crossing his face before he quickly restored his usual confident\nequanimity.\nThat… probably wasn’t wise to admit, Shallan realized. How many\npeople could draw so well from memory? Had Shallan publicly\ndemonstrated her skill in the warcamps?\nSo far as she knew, she hadn’t. Now she would have to keep that aspect\nof her skill secret, lest the Ghostbloods make a connection between Shallan\nthe lighteyed lady and Veil the darkeyed con artist. Storms.\nWell, she was bound to make some mistakes. At least this one wasn’t\nlife threatening. Probably."

Probably.\n“Jin,” Mraize snapped.\nA golden-haired man with a bare chest beneath a flowing outer robe\nstood up from one of the chairs.\n“Look at him,” Mraize said to Shallan.\nShe took a Memory.\n“Jin, leave us. You will draw him, Veil.”\nShe had no choice but to oblige. As Jin walked off, grumbling to\nhimself at the rain, Shallan started sketching. She did a full sketch—not just\nhis face and shoulders, but an environment study, including the background\nof fallen boulders. Nervous, she didn’t do as good a job as she could have,\nbut Mraize still cooed over her picture like a proud father. She finished and\ngot out her lacquer—this was in charcoal, and would want it—but Mraize\nplucked it from her fingers first.\n“Incredible,” he said, holding the sheet up. “You are wasted with Tyn.\nYou can’t do this with text, however?”\n“No,” Shallan lied.\n“Pity. Still, this is marvelous. Marvelous. There should be ways to use\nthis, yes indeed.” He looked to her. “What is your goal, child? I might have\na place for you in my organization, if you prove reliable.”\nYes! “I wouldn’t have agreed to come in Tyn’s place if I hadn’t wanted\nthat opportunity.”\nMraize narrowed his eyes at Shallan. “You killed her, didn’t you?”\nOh, blast. Shallan blushed immediately, of course. “Uh…”\n“Ha!” Mraize exclaimed. “She finally picked an assistant who was too\ncapable. Delightful. After all of her arrogant posturing, she was brought\ndown by someone she thought to make into a sycophant.”\n“Sir,” Shallan said. “I didn’t… I mean, I didn’t want to. She turned on\nme.”\n“That must be quite the story,” Mraize said, smiling. It was not a\npleasant smile. “Know that what you have done is not forbidden, but it is\nhardly encouraged. We cannot run an organization properly if subordinates\nconsider hunting their superiors to be a primary method of advancement.”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Your superior, however, was not a member of our organization. Tyn\nthought herself to be the hunter, but she was game all along. If you are to\njoin us, you should understand. We are not like others you may have\nknown. We have a greater purpose, and we are… protective of one another.”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“So who are you?” he asked, waving for his servant to bring back the\nblowgun. “Who are you really, Veil?”\n“Someone who wants to be part of things,” Shallan said. “Things more\nimportant than stealing from the odd lighteyes or scamming for a weekend\nof luxury.”\n“So it is a hunt, then,” Mraize said softly, grinning. He turned away\nfrom her, walking back to the edge of the pavilion. “More instructions will\nfollow. Do the task assigned to you. Then we shall see.”\nIt is a hunt, then…"

Shallan felt chilled by that statement.\nOnce again, her dismissal was uncertain, but she did up her satchel and\nstarted to leave. As she did so, she glanced at the remaining seated people.\nTheir expressions were cold. Frighteningly so.\nShallan left the pavilion and found that the rain had stopped. She\nwalked away, feeling eyes on her back. They all know that I can identify\nthem with exactness, she realized, and can present accurate pictures of them\nfor any who request.\nThey would not like that. Mraize had made it clear that Ghostbloods\ndidn’t often kill one another. But he’d also made it clear that she wasn’t one\nof them, not yet. He’d said it pointedly, as if granting permission to those\nlistening in.\nTalat’s hand, what had she gotten herself into?\nYou’re only considering that now? she thought as she rounded the\nhillside. Her carriage was ahead, the coachman lounging on top, his back to\nher. Shallan looked anxiously over her shoulder. Nobody had followed yet,\nat least not that she could see.\n“Is anyone watching, Pattern?” she asked.\n“Mmm. Me. No people.”\nA rock. She’d drawn a boulder in the picture for Mraize. Not thinking—\nworking by instinct and no small amount of panic—she breathed out\nStormlight and shaped an image of that boulder before her.\nThen, she promptly hid inside of it.\nIt was dark in there. She curled up in the boulder, sitting with her legs\npulled against her. It felt undignified. The other people Mraize worked with\nprobably didn’t do silly things like this. They were practiced, smooth,\ncapable. Storms, she probably didn’t need to be hiding in the first place.\nShe sat there anyway. The looks in the eyes of the others… the way that\nMraize had spoken…\nBetter to be overly cautious than naive. She was tired of people\nassuming she couldn’t care for herself.\n“Pattern,” she whispered. “Go to the carriage driver. Tell him this, in my\nexact voice. ‘I have entered the carriage when you weren’t looking. Do not\nlook. My exit must be stealthy. Carry me back to the city. Pull up to the\nwarcamps and wait to a count of ten. I will leave. Do not look. You have\nyour payment, and discretion was part of it.’”\nPattern hummed and moved off. A short time later, the carriage rattled\naway, pulled by its parshmen. It didn’t take long for hoofbeats to follow.\nShe hadn’t seen horses.\nShallan waited, anxious. Would any of the Ghostbloods realize this\nboulder wasn’t supposed to be here? Would they come back, looking for her\nonce they didn’t see her leave the carriage at the warcamps?\nPerhaps they hadn’t even gone after her. Perhaps she was being\nparanoid. She waited, pained. It started raining again. What would that do to\nher illusion? The stone she’d drawn had already been wet, so dryness"

The stone she’d drawn had already been wet, so dryness\nwouldn’t give it away—but from the way the rain fell on her, it obviously\nwas passing through the image.\nI need to find a way to see the outside while I’m hiding like this, she\nthought. Eyeholes? Could she make those inside her illusion? Perhaps she\n—\nVoices.\n“We will need to find how much he knows.” Mraize’s voice. “You will\nbring these pages to Master Thaidakar. We are close, but so—it appears—\nare Restares’s cronies.”\nThe response came in a rasping voice. Shallan couldn’t make it out.\n“No, I’m not worried about that one. The old fool sows chaos, but does\nnot reach for the power offered by opportunity. He hides in his insignificant\ncity, listening to its songs, thinking he plays in world events. He has no\nidea. His is not the position of the hunter. This creature in Tukar, however,\nis different. I’m not convinced he is human. If he is, he’s certainly not of the\nlocal species…”\nMraize continued speaking, but Shallan heard no more as they moved\noff. A short time later, she heard more hoofbeats.\nShe waited, water soaking though her coat and trousers. She shivered,\nsatchel in her lap, and clenched her teeth to keep them from chattering.\nWeather lately had been warmer, but sitting in the rain belied that. She\nwaited until her spine complained and her muscles screamed at her. She\nwaited until finally, the boulder broke into luminescent smoke and faded\naway.\nShallan started. What had happened?\nStormlight, she realized, stretching her legs. She checked the pouch in\nher pocket. She’d drained every sphere, unconsciously, while holding up the\nillusion of the boulder.\nHours had passed, the sky darkening as evening approached.\nMaintaining something simple like the boulder didn’t take much Light, and\nshe didn’t have to consciously think about it to keep it going. That was\ngood to know.\nShe’d also proven herself a fool again for not even worrying about how\nmuch Light she had been using. Sighing, she climbed to her feet. She\nwobbled, her legs protesting the sudden motion. She took a deep breath,\nthen walked over and peeked around the corner. The pavilion was gone and\nall signs of the Ghostbloods with it.\n“I guess this means I’m walking,” Shallan said, turning back toward the\nwarcamps.\n“Did you expect otherwise?” Pattern asked from his place on her coat,\nsounding genuinely curious.\n“No,” Shallan said. “I’m just talking to myself.”\n“Mmm. No, you talk to me.”\nShe walked on into the evening, cold. However, it wasn’t the deadly\ncoldness she’d suffered in the south. This was uncomfortable, but nothing\nmore. If she hadn’t been wet, the air probably would have been pleasant,\ndespite the shade. She passed the time practicing her accents with Pattern—\nshe’d speak, then have him repeat back to her exactly what she’d said, in\nher voice and tone. Being able to hear it that way helped a great deal."

Being able to hear it that way helped a great deal.\nShe had the Alethi accent down, she was certain. That was good, since\nVeil pretended to be Alethi. That one was easy, however, as Veden and\nAlethi were so similar you could almost understand one by knowing the\nother.\nHer Horneater accent was quite good too, in both Alethi and Veden. She\nwas getting better and not overdoing it, as Tyn had suggested. Her Bav\naccent in both Veden and Alethi was passable, and through most of the time\nwalking back, she practiced speaking both tongues with a Herdazian accent.\nPalona gave her a good example of this in Alethi, and Pattern could repeat\nto her things the woman had said, which was helpful for practice.\n“What I need to do,” Shallan said, “is train you to speak along with my\nimages.”\n“You should have them speak themselves,” Pattern said.\n“Can I do that?”\n“Why not?”\n“Because… well, I use Light for the illusion, and so they create an\nimitation of light. Makes sense. I don’t use sound to make them, though.”\n“This is a Surge,” Pattern said. “Sound is a part of it. Mmm… Cousins\nof one another. Very similar. It can be done.”\n“How?”\n“Mmmm. Somehow.”\n“You’re very helpful.”\n“I am glad…” He trailed off. “Lie?”\n“Yup.” Shallan stuffed her safehand into her pocket, which was also\nwet, and continued walking through patches of grass that pulled away in\nfront of her. Distant hills showed lavis grain growing in orderly fields of\npolyps, though she didn’t see any farmers at this hour.\nAt least it had stopped raining. She did still like rain, though she hadn’t\nconsidered how unpleasant it might be to have to walk a long distance in it.\nAnd—\nWhat was that?\nShe pulled up short. A clump of something dark shadowed the ground\nahead of her. She approached hesitantly, and found that she could smell\nsmoke. The sodden, wet kind of smoke you smelled after a campfire was\ndoused.\nHer carriage. She could make it out now, partially burned in the night.\nThe rains had put out the fire; it hadn’t burned long. They’d probably\nstarted the blaze on the inside, where it would have been dry.\nIt was certainly the one she’d hired. She recognized the trim on the\nwheels. She approached hesitantly. Well, she’d been right in her worry. It\nwas a good thing she’d stayed behind. Something nagged at her…\nThe coachman!\nShe ran ahead, fearing the worst. His corpse was there, lying beside the\nbroken carriage, staring up at the sky. His throat had been slit. Beside him,\nhis parshman porters lay dead in a pile.\nShallan sat back on the wet stones, feeling sick, hand to her mouth.\n“Oh… Almighty above…”\n“Mmm…” Pattern hummed, somehow conveying a morose tone.\n“They’re dead because of me,” Shallan whispered.\n“You did not kill them.”"

Voidbringers, yes, but\nit was difficult not to feel sick at what had been done.\nYou’ll cause something far worse than this if you prove what Jasnah\nclaims, part of her said.\nBriefly, while watching Mraize’s excitement over her art, she’d wanted\nto like the man. Well, she’d best remember this moment. He’d allowed\nthese murders. He might not have been the one to slit the coachman’s\nthroat, but he’d all but assured the others it was all right to remove her if\nthey could.\nThey’d burned the carriage to make it look like bandits had been behind\nthis, but no bandits would come this close to the Shattered Plains.\nYou poor man, she thought toward the coachman. But if she hadn’t\narranged a ride, she wouldn’t have been able to hide as she did while the\ncoach laid a false trail. Storms! How could she have handled this so nobody\ndied?

The Rules of the Game\nThe considerable abilities of the Skybreakers\nfor making such amounted to an almost divine\nskill, for which no specific Surge or spren grants\ncapacity, but however the order came to such an\naptitude, the fact of it was real and acknowledged\neven by their rivals.\nFrom Words of Radiance, chapter 28, page\n3\n“Great. You’re the one guarding me today?”\nKaladin turned as Adolin came out of his room. The prince wore a sharp\nuniform, as always. Monogrammed buttons, boots that cost more than some\nhouses, side sword. An odd choice for a Shardbearer, but Adolin probably\nwore it as an ornament. His hair was a mess of blond sprinkled with black.\n“I don’t trust her, princeling,” Kaladin said. “Foreign woman, secret\nbetrothal, and the only person who could vouch for her is dead. She could\nbe an assassin, and that means putting you under the watch of the best I\nhave.”\n“Humble, aren’t we?” Adolin said, striding down the stone hallway,\nKaladin falling into step beside him.\n“No.”\n“That was a joke, bridgeboy.”\n“My mistake. I was under the impression that jokes were supposed to be\nfunny.”\n“Only to people with a sense of humor.”\n“Ah, of course,” Kaladin said. “I traded in my sense of humor long\nago.”\n“And what did you get for it?”\n“Scars,” Kaladin said softly.\nAdolin’s eyes flicked toward the brands on Kaladin’s forehead, though\nmost would be obscured by hair. “This is great,” Adolin said under his\nbreath. “Just great. I’m so happy you’re coming along.”\nAt the end of the hallway, they stepped into daylight. Not much of it,"

He had two\nor three men on everyone else, but Adolin he figured he could watch on his\nown.\nA carriage waited, pulled by two mean-looking horses. All horses\nlooked mean, with those too-knowing eyes and sudden movements.\nUnfortunately, a prince couldn’t arrive in a carriage pulled by chulls.

Blue\neyes, black hair, black uniform. What was he doing driving the carriage? He\nwasn’t a servant, was he?\nKaladin clambered cautiously up into his seat, and Wit shook the reins,\nprodding the horses into motion.\n“What are you doing here?” Kaladin asked him.\n“Trying to find mischief,” Wit replied cheerfully, as the horses’ hooves\nrang against the stone. “Have you been practicing with my flute?”\n“Uh…”\n“Don’t tell me you left it in Sadeas’s camp when you moved out.”\n“Well—”\n“I said not to tell me,” Wit replied. “You don’t need to, since I already\nknow. A shame. If you knew the history of that flute, it would make your\nbrain flip upside-down. And by that, I mean that I would shove you off the\ncarriage for having spied on me.”\n“Uh…”\n“Eloquent today, I see.”\nKaladin had left the flute behind. When he had gathered the bridgemen\nleft in Sadeas’s camp—the wounded from Bridge Four, and the members of\nthe other bridge crews—he’d been focused on people, not things. He hadn’t\nbothered with his little bundle of possessions, forgetting that the flute was\namong them.\n“I’m a soldier, not a musician,” Kaladin said. “Besides, music is for\nwomen.”\n“All people are musicians,” Wit countered. “The question is whether or\nnot they share their songs. As for music being feminine, it’s interesting that\nthe woman who wrote that treatise—the one you all practically worship in\nAlethkar—decided that all of the feminine tasks involve sitting around\nhaving fun while all the masculine ones involve finding someone to stick a\nspear in you. Telling, eh?”\n“I guess so.”\n“You know, I’m working very hard to come up with engaging, clever,\nmeaningful points of interest to offer you. I can’t help thinking you’re not\nupholding your side of the conversation. It’s a little like playing music for a\ndeaf man. Which I might try doing, as it sounds fun, if only someone hadn’t\nlost my flute.”"

Which I might try doing, as it sounds fun, if only someone hadn’t\nlost my flute.”\n“I’m sorry,” Kaladin said. He’d rather be thinking about the new sword\nstances that Zahel had taught him, but Wit had shown him kindness before.\nThe least Kaladin could do was chat with him. “So, uh, did you keep your\njob? As King’s Wit, I mean. When we met before, you implied you were in\ndanger of losing your title.”\n“I haven’t checked yet,” Wit said.\n“You… you haven’t… Does the king know you’re back?”\n“Nope! I’m trying to think of a properly dramatic way to inform him.\nPerhaps a hundred chasmfiends marching in unison, singing an ode to my\nmagnificence.”\n“That sounds… hard.”\n“Yeah, the storming things have real trouble tuning their tonic chords\nand maintaining just intonation.”\n“I have no idea what you just said.”\n“Yeah, the storming things have real trouble tuning their tonic chords\nand maintaining just intonation.”\n“That didn’t help, Wit.”\n“Ah! So you’re going deaf, are you? Let me know when the process is\ncomplete. I have something I want to try. If I can just remember—”\n“Yes, yes,” Kaladin said, sighing. “You want to play the flute for one.”\n“No, that’s not it… Ah! Yes. I’ve always wanted to sneak up and poke a\ndeaf man in the back of the head. I think it will be hilarious.”\nKaladin sighed. It would take an hour or so, even moving quickly, to\nreach Sebarial’s warcamp. A very long hour.\n“So you’re just here,” Kaladin said, “to mock me?”\n“Well, it’s kind of what I do. But I’ll go easy on you. I wouldn’t want\nyou to go flying off on me.”\nKaladin jolted with a start.\n“You know,” Wit said, nonchalant, “flying off in an angry tirade. That\nkind of thing.”\nKaladin narrowed his eyes at the tall lighteyed man. “What do you\nknow?”\n“Almost everything. That almost part can be a real kick in the teeth\nsometimes.”\n“What do you want, then?”\n“What I can’t have.” Wit turned to him, eyes solemn. “Same as\neveryone else, Kaladin Stormblessed.”\nKaladin fidgeted. Wit knew about him and about Surgebinding. Kaladin\nwas sure of it. So, should he expect some kind of demand?\n“What do you want,” Kaladin said, trying to speak more precisely,\n“from me?”\n“Ah, so you’re thinking. Good. From you, my friend, I want one thing.\nA story.”\n“What kind of story?”\n“That is for you to decide.” Wit smiled at him. “I hope it will be\ndynamic. If there is one thing I cannot stomach, it is boredom. Kindly avoid\nbeing dull. Otherwise I might have to sneak up and poke you in the back of\nthe head.”\n“I’m not going deaf.”\n“It’s also hilarious on people who aren’t deaf, obviously.

That would be\nimmoral. No, I torment all people equally, thank you very much.”\n“Great.” Kaladin settled back, waiting for more. Amazingly, Wit seemed\ncontent to let the conversation die.\nKaladin watched the sky, so dull. He hated days like these, which\nreminded him of the Weeping. Stormfather. Grey skies and miserable\nweather made him wonder why he’d even bothered to get out of bed.\nEventually, the carriage reached Sebarial’s warcamp, a place that looked\neven more like a city than the other warcamps. Kaladin marveled at the\nfully constructed tenements, the markets, the—\n“Farmers?” he asked as they rolled past a group of men hiking toward\nthe gates, carrying worming reeds and buckets of crem.\n“Sebarial has them setting up lavis fields on the southwestern hills,” Wit\nexplained.\n“The highstorms out here are too powerful for farming.”\n“Tell that to the Natan people. They used to farm this entire area.\nRequires a strain of plant that doesn’t grow as large as you’re accustomed\nto.”\n“But why?” Kaladin asked. “Why wouldn’t farmers go someplace\nwhere it’s easier? Like Alethkar proper.”\n“You don’t know a lot about human nature, do you, Stormblessed?”\n“I… No, I don’t.”\nWit shook his head. “So frank, so blunt. You and Dalinar are alike,\ncertainly. Someone needs to teach the pair of you how to have a good time\nnow and then.”\n“I know full well how to have a good time.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Yes. It involves being anywhere you aren’t.”\nWit stared at him, then chuckled, shaking the reins so the horses danced\na little. “So you do have some spark of wit in you.”\nIt came from Kaladin’s mother. She’d often said things like that, though\nnever so insulting. Being around Wit must be corrupting me.\nEventually, Wit pulled the carriage up to a nice manor home, the likes of\nwhich Kaladin would have expected in some fine lait, not here in a\nwarcamp. With those pillars and beautiful glass windows, it was even finer\nthan the citylord’s manor back in Hearthstone.\nIn the carriageway, Wit asked the footman to fetch Adolin’s causal\nbetrothed. Adolin climbed out to await her, straightening his jacket,\npolishing the buttons on one sleeve. He glanced up toward the driver’s seat,\nthen started.\n“You!” Adolin exclaimed.\n“Me!” Wit replied. He swung down from the top of the carriage and\nperformed a flowery bow. “Ever at your service, Brightlord Kholin.”\n“What did you do with my usual carriage driver?”\n“Nothing.”\n“Wit—”\n“What, you’re implying that I hurt the poor fellow? Does that sound\nlike me, Adolin?”\n“Well, no,” Adolin said.\n“Exactly. Besides, I’m certain he’s gotten the ropes undone by now. Ah,\nand here’s your lovely almost-but-not-quite bride.”"

Ah,\nand here’s your lovely almost-but-not-quite bride.”\nShallan Davar had emerged from the house. She bobbed down the steps,\nnot gliding down them as most lighteyed ladies would have. She’s certainly\nan enthusiastic one, Kaladin thought idly, holding the reins, which he’d\npicked up after Wit had dropped them.\nSomething just felt off about this Shallan Davar. What was she hiding\nbehind that eager attitude and ready smile? That buttoned sleeve on the\nsafehand of a lighteyed woman’s dress, that could hide any number of\ndeadly implements. A simple poisoned needle, stuck through the fabric,\nwould be enough to end Adolin’s life.\nUnfortunately, he couldn’t watch her every moment she was with\nAdolin. He had to show more initiative than that; could he instead confirm\nthat she was who she said she was? Decide from her past if she was a threat\nor not?\nKaladin stood up, planning to jump down onto the ground to keep an\neye on her as she approached Adolin. She suddenly started, eyes widening.\nShe pointed at Wit with her freehand.\n“You!” Shallan exclaimed.\n“Yes, yes. People certainly are good at identifying me today. Perhaps I\nneed to wear—”\nWit cut off as Shallan lunged at him. Kaladin dropped to the ground,\nreaching for his side knife, then hesitated as Shallan grabbed Wit in an\nembrace, her head against his chest, her eyes squeezed shut.\nKaladin took his hand off his knife, raising an eyebrow at Wit, who\nlooked completely flabbergasted. He stood with his arms at his sides, as if\nhe didn’t know what to do with them.\n“I always wanted to say thank you,” Shallan whispered. “I never had a\nchance.”\nAdolin cleared his throat. Finally, Shallan released Wit and looked at the\nprince.\n“You hugged Wit,” Adolin said.\n“Is that his name?” Shallan asked.\n“One of them,” Wit said, apparently still unsettled. “There are too many\nto count, really. Granted, most of them are related to one form of curse or\nanother…”\n“You hugged Wit,” Adolin said.\nShallan blushed. “Was that improper?”\n“It’s not about propriety,” Adolin said. “It’s about common sense.\nHugging him is like hugging a whitespine or, or a pile of nails or\nsomething. I mean it’s Wit. You’re not supposed to like him.”\n“We need to talk,” Shallan said, looking up at Wit. “I don’t remember\neverything we talked about, but some of it—”\n“I’ll try to squeeze it into my schedule,” Wit said. “I’m fairly busy,\nthough. I mean, insulting Adolin alone is going to take until sometime next\nweek.”\nAdolin shook his head, waving away the footman and helping Shallan\ninto the carriage himself. After he did so, he leaned in to Wit. “Hands off.”\n“She’s far too young for me, child,” Wit said.\n“That’s right,” Adolin said with a nod. “Stick to women your own age.”"

I think there’s only one\nof those around these parts, and she and I never did get along.”\n“You are so bizarre,” Adolin said, climbing into the carriage.\nKaladin sighed, then moved to follow them in.\n“You intend to ride in there?” Wit asked, grin widening.\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said. He wanted to watch Shallan. She wasn’t likely to\ntry something in the open, while riding in the carriage with Adolin. But\nKaladin might learn something by watching her, and he couldn’t be\nabsolutely certain she wouldn’t try to harm him.\n“Try not to flirt with the girl,” Wit whispered. “Young Adolin seems to\nbe growing possessive. Or… what am I saying? Flirt with the girl, Kaladin.\nIt might make the prince’s eyes bulge.”\nKaladin snorted. “She’s lighteyed.”\n“So?” Wit asked. “You people are too fixated on that.”\n“No offense,” Kaladin whispered, “but I’d sooner flirt with a\nchasmfiend.” He left Wit to drive the carriage, hauling himself into it.\nInside, Adolin looked toward the heavens. “You’re kidding.”\n“It’s my job,” Kaladin said, seating himself next to Adolin.\n“Surely I’m safe in here,” Adolin said through gritted teeth, “with my\nbetrothed.”\n“Well, maybe I just want a comfortable seat, then,” Kaladin said,\nnodding to Shallan Davar.\nShe ignored him, smiling at Adolin as the carriage started rolling.\n“Where are we going today?”\n“Well, you said something about a dinner,” Adolin said. “I know of a\nnew winehouse in the Outer Market, and it actually serves food.”\n“You always know the best places,” Shallan said, her smile widening.\nCould you be any more obvious with your flattery, woman? Kaladin\nthought.\nAdolin smiled back. “I just listen.”\n“Now if you only paid more attention to what wines were good…”\n“I don’t because it’s easy!” He grinned. “They’re all good.”\nShe giggled.\nStorms, lighteyes were annoying. Particularly when they fawned over\none another. Their conversation continued, and Kaladin found it blatantly\nobvious how badly this woman wanted a relationship with Adolin. Well,\nthat wasn’t surprising. Lighteyes were always looking for chances to get\nahead—or to stab one another in the back, if they were in that mood\ninstead. His job wasn’t to figure out if this woman was an opportunist.\nEvery lighteyes was an opportunist. He just had to find out if she was an\nopportunistic fortune hunter or an opportunistic assassin.\nThey continued talking, and Shallan circled the conversation back\ntoward the day’s activity.\n“Now, I’m not saying I mind another winehouse,” Shallan said. “But I\ndo wonder if those are becoming a tad too obvious a choice.”\n“I know,” Adolin replied. “But there’s storming little to do out here\notherwise. No concerts, no art shows, no sculpture contests.”\nIs that really what you people spend your time on? Kaladin wondered."

No concerts, no art shows, no sculpture contests.”\nIs that really what you people spend your time on? Kaladin wondered.\nAlmighty save you if you don’t have sculpture contests to watch.\n“There’s a menagerie,” Shallan said, eager. “In the Outer Market.”\n“A menagerie,” Adolin said. “Isn’t that a little… low?”\n“Oh, come on. We could look at all of the animals, and you could tell\nme which ones you’ve bravely slaughtered while hunting. It’ll be very\ndiverting.” She hesitated, and Kaladin thought he saw something in her\neyes. A flash of something deeper. Pain? Worry? “And I could use some\ndistraction,” Shallan added more softly.\n“I actually despise hunting,” Adolin said, as if he hadn’t noticed. “No\nreal contest to it.” He looked to Shallan, who pasted on a smile and nodded\neagerly. “Well, something different could be a pleasant change. All right,\nI’ll tell Wit to take us there instead. Hopefully he’ll do it, instead of driving\nus into a chasm to laugh at our screams of horror.”\nAdolin turned to open the small sliding shutter up to the driver’s perch\nand gave the order. Kaladin watched Shallan, who sat back, a self-satisfied\nsmile on her face. She had an ulterior motive for going to the menagerie.\nWhat was it?\nAdolin turned back around and asked after her day. Kaladin listened\nwith half an ear, studying Shallan, trying to pick out any knives hidden on\nher person. She blushed at something Adolin said, then laughed. Kaladin\ndidn’t really like Adolin, but at least the prince was honest. He had his\nfather’s earnest temperament, and had always been straight with Kaladin.\nDismissive and spoiled, but straight.\nThis woman was different. Her movements were calculated. The way\nshe laughed, the way she chose her words. She would giggle and blush, but\nher eyes were always discerning, always watching. She exemplified what\nmade him sick about lighteyed culture.\nYou’re just in an irritable mood, part of him acknowledged. It happened\nsometimes, more often when the sky was cloudy. But did they have to act\nnauseatingly cheery?\nHe kept an eye on Shallan as the ride continued, and eventually decided\nhe was being too suspicious of her. She wasn’t an immediate threat to\nAdolin. He found his mind drifting back toward the night in the chasms.\nRiding the winds, Light churning inside of him. Freedom.\nNo, not just freedom. Purpose.\nYou have a purpose, Kaladin thought, dragging his mind back to the\npresent. Guard Adolin. This was an ideal job for a soldier, one others\ndreamed of. Great pay, his own squad to command, an important task. A\ndependable commander. It was perfect.\nBut those winds…\n“Oh!” Shallan said, reaching for her satchel and digging into it. “I\nbrought that account for you, Adolin.” She hesitated, glancing at Kaladin.\n“You can trust him,” Adolin said, somewhat grudgingly. “He’s saved my"

Yenev wasn’t defeated in battle. He was\nkilled in a duel. By Sadeas.”\nAdolin nodded, leaning forward, eager.\n“Here is Brightness Ialai’s own account of events,” Shallan said.\n“‘Bringing down Yenev was an act of inspired simplicity. My husband\nspoke with Gavilar regarding the Right of Challenge and the King’s Boon,\nancient traditions that many of the lighteyes knew, but ignored in modern\ncircumstances.\n“‘As traditions that shared a relationship to the historical crown,\ninvoking them echoed our right of rule. The occasion was a gala of might\nand renown, and my husband first entered into a duel with another man.’”\n“A what of might and renown?” Kaladin asked.\nBoth looked at him, as if surprised to hear him speak. Keep forgetting\nI’m here, do you? Kaladin thought. You prefer to ignore darkeyes.\n“A gala of might and renown,” Adolin said. “It’s fancy speak for a\ntournament. They were common back then. Ways for the highprinces who\nhappened to be at peace with one another to show off.”\n“We need a way for Adolin to duel, or at least discredit, Sadeas,”\nShallan explained. “While thinking about it, I remembered a reference to\nthe Yenev duel in Jasnah’s biography of the old king.”\n“All right…” Kaladin said, frowning.\n“‘The purpose,’” Shallan continued, holding up her finger as she read\nfurther from the account, “‘of this preliminary duel was to conspicuously\nawe and impress the highprinces. Though we had plotted this earlier, the\nfirst man to be defeated did not know of his role in our ploy. Sadeas\ndefeated him with calculated spectacle. He paused the fighting at several\npoints and raised the stakes, first with money, then with lands.\n“‘In the end, the victory was dramatic. With the crowd so engaged, King\nGavilar stood and offered Sadeas a boon for having pleased him, after the\nancient tradition. Sadeas’s reply was simple: ‘I will have no boon other than\nYenev’s cowardly heart on the end of my sword, Your Majesty!’”\n“You’re kidding,” Adolin said. “Blowhard Sadeas said it like that?”\n“The event, along with his words, is recorded in several major\nhistories,” Shallan said. “Sadeas then dueled Yenev, killed the man, and\nmade an opening for an ally—Aladar—to take control of that princedom\ninstead.”\nAdolin nodded thoughtfully. “It could work, Shallan.

I can try the same\nthing—make a spectacle of my fight with Relis and the other person he\nbrings, wow the crowd, earn a boon from the king and demand a Right of\nChallenge to Sadeas himself.”\n“It has a certain charm to it,” Shallan agreed. “Taking a maneuver that\nSadeas himself employed, then using it against him.”\n“He’d never agree,” Kaladin said. “Sadeas won’t let himself be trapped\nlike that.”\n“Perhaps,” Adolin said. “But I think you underestimate the position he’d\nbe in, if we do this correctly. The Right of Challenge is an ancient tradition\n—some say the Heralds instituted it. A lighteyed warrior who has proven\nhimself before the Almighty and the king, turning and demanding justice\nfrom one who wronged him…”\n“He’ll agree,” Shallan said. “He’ll have to. But can you be spectacular,\nAdolin?”\n“The crowd expects me to cheat,” Adolin said. “They won’t come\nthinking much of my recent duels—that should work to my favor. If I can\ngive them a real show, they’ll be thrilled. Besides, defeating two men at\nonce? That alone should give us the attention we need.”\nKaladin looked from one to the other. They were taking this very\nseriously. “You really think this could work?” Kaladin said, growing\nthoughtful.\n“Yes,” Shallan said, “though, by this tradition, Sadeas could appoint a\nchampion to fight on his behalf, so Adolin might not get to duel him\npersonally. He’d still win Sadeas’s Shards, though.”\n“It wouldn’t be quite as satisfying,” Adolin said. “But it would be\nacceptable. Beating his champion in a duel would cut Sadeas off at the\nknees. He’d lose immense credibility.”\n“But it wouldn’t really mean anything,” Kaladin said. “Right?”\nThe other two looked at him.\n“It’s just a duel,” Kaladin said. “A game.”\n“This would be different,” Adolin said.\n“I don’t see why. Sure, you might win his Shards, but his title and\nauthority would be the same.”\n“It’s about perception,” Shallan said. “Sadeas has formed a coalition\nagainst the king. That implies he is stronger than the king. Losing to the\nking’s champion would deflate that.”\n“But it’s all just games,” Kaladin said.\n“Yes,” Adolin said—Kaladin hadn’t expected him to agree. “But it’s a\ngame that Sadeas is playing. They are rules he’s accepted.”\nKaladin sat back, letting it sink in. This tradition might be an answer, he\nthought. The solution I’ve been looking for…\n“Sadeas used to be such a strong ally,” Adolin said, sounding regretful.\n“I’d forgotten things like his defeat of Yenev.”\n“So what changed?” Kaladin asked.\n“Gavilar died,” Adolin said softly. “The old king was what kept Father\nand Sadeas pointed in the same direction.” He leaned forward, looking at\nShallan’s sheets of notes, though he obviously couldn’t read them. “We\nhave to make this happen, Shallan. We have to yank this noose around that"

Thank you.”\nShe blushed, then packed away the notes in an envelope and handed it\nto him. “Give this to your aunt. It details what I’ve found. She and your\nfather will know better if this is a good idea or not.”\nAdolin accepted the envelope, and took her hand in his as he did so. The\ntwo shared a moment, melting over one another. Yes, Kaladin was\nincreasingly convinced that the woman wasn’t going to be of immediate\ndanger to Adolin. If she was some kind of con woman, she wasn’t after\nAdolin’s life. Just his dignity.\nToo late, Kaladin thought, watching Adolin sit back with a stupid grin\non his face. That’s dead and burned already.\nThe carriage soon reached the Outer Market, where they passed several\ngroups of men on patrol in Kholin blue. Bridgemen from the various\nbridges other than Bridge Four. Being guardsmen here was one of the ways\nKaladin was training them.\nKaladin climbed out of the carriage first, noting the lines of\nstormwagons set up in rows nearby. Ropes on posts blocked off the area,\nostensibly to keep people from sneaking in, though the men with cudgels\nlounging beside some of the posts probably did a better job of that.\n“Thanks for the ride, Wit,” Kaladin said, turning. “I’m sorry again about\nthat flute you—”\nWit was gone from the top of the carriage. Another man sat there\ninstead, a younger fellow in brown trousers and a white shirt, a cap on his\nhead. He pulled that off, looking embarrassed.\n“Oi’m sorry, sir,” the man said. He had an accent Kaladin didn’t\nrecognize. “He paid me well, he did. Said exactly where Oi was to stand so\nwe could swap places.”\n“What’s this?” Adolin said, climbing from the carriage and looking up.\n“Oh. Wit does this, bridgeboy.”\n“This?”\n“Likes to vanish mysteriously,” Adolin said.\n“It weren’t so mysterious, sir,” the lad said, turning and pointing. “It\nwas joust back there a short ways, where the carriage stopped ’fore turning.\nOi was to wait for him, then take over driving this here coach. Oi had to\nhop on without jostling things. He ran off giggling like a child, he did.”\n“He just likes to surprise people,” Adolin said, helping Shallan from the\ncarriage. “Ignore him.”\nThe new carriage driver hunched down as if embarrassed. Kaladin\ndidn’t recognize him; he wasn’t one of Adolin’s regular servants. I’ll have\nto ride up there on the way back. Keep an eye on the man.\nShallan and Adolin walked off toward the menagerie. Kaladin retrieved\nhis spear from the back of the carriage, then jogged to catch up, eventually\nfalling in a few steps behind them. He listened to them both laughing, and\nwanted to punch them in the face.\n“Wow,” Syl’s voice said. “You’re supposed to harness the storms,\nKaladin. Not carry them about behind your eyes.”"

He set his spear on his shoulder and kept walking.\n“What’s wrong?” Syl asked, settling down in the air in front of him.\nWhichever way he turned his head, she automatically glided that way, as if\nseated on an invisible shelf, girlish dress fluttering to mist just below her\nknees.\n“Nothing’s wrong,” Kaladin said softly. “I’m just tired of listening to\nthose two.”\nSyl looked over her shoulder at the pair just ahead. Adolin paid their\nway in, thumbing back toward Kaladin, paying for him as well. A pompous-\nlooking Azish man in an odd patterned hat and long coat with an intricate\ndesign waved them forward, pointing to the different rows of cages and\nindicating which animals were where.\n“Shallan and Adolin seem happy,” Syl said. “What’s wrong with that?”\n“Nothing,” Kaladin said. “So long as I don’t have to listen to it.”\nSyl wrinkled her nose. “It’s not them, it’s you. You’re being sour. I can\npractically taste it.”\n“Taste?” Kaladin asked. “You don’t eat, Syl. I doubt you have a sense of\ntaste.”\n“It’s a metaphor. And I can imagine it. And you taste sour. And stop\narguing, because I’m right.” She zipped off to dangle near Shallan and\nAdolin as they inspected the first cage.\nBlasted spren, Kaladin thought, walking up bedside Shallan and Adolin.\nArguing with her is like… well, arguing with the wind, I guess.\nThis stormwagon looked a lot like the slaver cage he’d ridden in on his\nway to the Shattered Plains, though the animal within looked to have been\ntreated far better than the slaves had. It sat on a rock, and the cage had been\ncovered over with crem on the inside as if to imitate a cave. The creature\nitself was little more than a lump of flesh with two bulbous eyes and four\nlong tentacles.\n“Ooo…” Shallan said, eyes wide. She looked like she’d been given a\npile of jewelry—only instead, it was a slimy lump of something that\nKaladin would have expected to find stuck to the bottom of his boot.\n“That,” Adolin said, “is the ugliest thing I’ve ever seen. It’s like the stuff\nin the middle of a hasper, only without the shell.”\n“It’s one of the sarpenthyn,” Shallan said.\n“Poor thing,” Adolin said. “Did its mother give it that name?”\nShallan swatted him on the shoulder. “It’s a family.”\n“So the mother was behind it.”\n“A family of animals, idiot. They have more of them in the west, where\nthe storms aren’t as strong. I’ve only seen a few of them—we’ve got little\nones in Jah Keved, but nothing like this. I don’t even know what species\nthis is.” She hesitated, then stuck her fingers through the bars and grabbed\none of the tentacle arms."

        "text": "ones in Jah Keved, but nothing like this. I don’t even know what species\nthis is.” She hesitated, then stuck her fingers through the bars and grabbed\none of the tentacle arms.\nThe thing pulled away immediately, inflating to look bigger, raising two\nof its arms behind its head in a threatening way. Adolin yelped and pulled\nShallan back.\n“He said not to touch any of them!” Adolin said. “What if it’s\npoisonous?”\nShallan ignored him, digging a notebook from her satchel. “Warm to the\ntouch,” she mumbled to herself. “Truly warm-blooded. Fascinating. I need a\nsketch of it.” She squinted at a little plaque on the cage. “Well, that’s\nuseless.”\n“What does it say?” Adolin asked.\n“‘Devil rock captured in Marabethia. The locals claim it is the reborn\nvengeful spirit of a child who was murdered.’ Not even a mention of its\nspecies. What kind of scholarship is this?”\n“It’s a menagerie, Shallan,” Adolin said, chuckling. “Brought all this\ndistance to entertain soldiers and camp followers.”\nIndeed, the menagerie was popular. As Shallan sketched, Kaladin kept\nbusy watching those who passed by, making certain they kept their distance.\nHe saw everything from washmaids and tenners to officers, and even some\nhigher lighteyes. Behind them, a lighteyed woman was paraded past in her\npalanquin, barely even glancing at the cages. It provided quite a contrast to\nShallan’s eager drawing and Adolin’s good-natured gibes.\nKaladin wasn’t giving those two enough credit. They might ignore him,\nbut they weren’t actively mean to him. They were happy and pleasant. Why\ndid that annoy him so?\nEventually, Shallan and Adolin moved on to the next cage, which\ncontained skyeels and a large tub of water for them to dip in. They didn’t\nlook as comfortable as the “devil rock.” There wasn’t much room to move\nin the cage, and they didn’t often take to the air. Not very interesting.\nNext was a cage with a creature that looked like a small chull, but with\nlarger claws. Shallan wanted a sketch of this one too, so Kaladin found\nhimself lounging beside the cage, watching people pass and listening to\nAdolin try to crack jokes to amuse his betrothed. He wasn’t very good at it,\nbut Shallan laughed anyway.\n“Poor thing,” Syl said, landing on the floor of the cage, looking at its\ncrab occupant. “What kind of life is this?”\n“A safe one.” Kaladin shrugged. “At least it has no need to worry about\npredators. Always kept fed. I doubt a chull-thing could ask for more than\nthat.”\n“Oh?” Syl asked. “And you’d be all right if that were you.”\n“Of course not. I’m not a chull-thing. I’m a soldier.”\nThey moved on, passing cage after cage of animals. Some Shallan\nwanted to draw, others she concluded didn’t need an immediate sketch.

Apparently, she’d missed a chance at sketching one of these\na long time ago.\nKaladin had to admit the thing was pretty. How did it survive, though?\nIt had shell on the very front of its face, but the rest of it wasn’t squishy, so\nit couldn’t hide in cracks like the devil rock. What did this chicken do when\na storm came?\nSyl landed on Kaladin’s shoulder.\n“I’m a soldier,” Kaladin repeated, speaking very softly.\n“That’s what you were,” Syl said.\n“It’s what I want to be again.”\n“Are you sure?”\n“Mostly.” He folded his arms, spear leaning against his shoulder. “The\nonly thing is… It’s crazy, Syl. Insane. My time as a bridgeman was the\nworst in my life. We suffered death, oppression, indignity. Yet I don’t think\nI’ve ever felt so alive as I did in those final weeks.”\nNext to the work he’d done with Bridge Four, being a simple soldier—\neven a highly respected one, like captain of a highprince’s guard—just felt\nmundane. Ordinary.\nBut soaring on the winds—that had been anything but ordinary.\n“You’re almost ready, aren’t you?” Syl whispered.\nHe nodded slowly. “Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.”\nThe next cage in line had a large crowd around it, and even a few\nfearspren wiggling out of the ground. Kaladin pushed in, though he didn’t\nhave to clear a space—the people made room for Dalinar’s heir as soon as\nthey realized who he was. Adolin walked past them without a second\nglance, obviously accustomed to such deference.\nThis cage was different from the others. The bars were closer together,\nthe wood reinforced. The animal inside didn’t seem to deserve the special\ntreatment. The sorry beast lay in front of some rocks, eyes closed. The\nsquare face showed sharpened mandibles—like teeth, only somehow more\nvicious—and a pair of long, toothlike tusks that pointed down from the\nupper jaw. The stark spikes running from the head along the sinuous back,\nalong with powerful legs, were clues as to what this beast was.\n“Whitespine,” Shallan breathed, stepping closer to the cage.\nKaladin had never seen one. He remembered a young man, lying dead\non the operating table, blood everywhere. He remembered fear, frustration.\nAnd then misery.\n“I expected,” Kaladin said, trying to sort through it all, “the thing to\nbe… more.”\n“They don’t do well in captivity,” Shallan said. “This one probably\nwould have gone dormant in crystal long ago, if it had been allowed. They\nmust keep dousing it to wash away the shell.”\n“Don’t feel sorry for the thing,” Adolin said. “I’ve seen what they can\ndo to a man.”\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said softly.\nShallan got out her drawing things, though as she started, people began\nto move away from the cage.

I’m going to go check that\nout, the gesture implied. Adolin nodded and rested his hand on his sword.\nI’ll be on the watch, that said.\nKaladin jogged off, spear on his shoulder, to investigate. Unfortunately,\nhe soon recognized a familiar face above the crowd. Amaram was a tall\nman. Dalinar stood at his side, guarded by several of Kaladin’s men, who\nwere keeping the gawking crowd back a safe distance.\n“… heard my son was here,” Dalinar was saying to the well-dressed\nowner of the menagerie.\n“You needn’t pay, Highprince!” the menagerie owner said, speaking\nwith a lofty accent similar to Sigzil’s. “Your presence is a grand blessing\nfrom the Heralds upon my humble collection. And your distinguished\nguest.”\nAmaram. He wore a strange cloak. Bright yellow-gold, with a black\nglyph on the back. Oath? Kaladin didn’t recognize the shape. It looked\nfamiliar, though.\nThe double eye, he realized. Symbol of…\n“Is it true?” the menagerie owner asked, inspecting Amaram. “The\nrumors around camp are most intriguing…”\nDalinar sighed audibly. “We were going to announce this at the feast\ntonight, but as Amaram insists on wearing the cloak, I suppose it needs to\nbe stated. Under the king’s direction, I have commanded the refounding of\nthe Knights Radiant. Let it be spoken of in the camps. The ancient oaths are\nspoken again, and Brightlord Amaram was—at my request—the first to\nspeak them. The Knights Radiant have been reestablished, and he stands at\ntheir head.”\n56.

The dueling arena rose before them, another of the craterlike\nformations that rimmed the Shattered Plains. It was much smaller than the\nones that held the warcamps, however, and had tiered seats inside.\nWith both Elhokar and Dalinar in attendance—not to mention Navani\nand both of Dalinar’s sons—Kaladin had brought every guard he could.\nThat included some of the men from Bridge Seventeen and Bridge Two.\nThose stood proudly, with spears held high, obviously excited to finally be\ntrusted with their first bodyguard assignment.

In total, he had forty men on\nduty.\nNone of them would be worth a drop of rain if the Assassin in White\nattacked.\n“Can we be certain?” Kaladin asked, nodding toward Amaram, who still\nwore his yellow-gold cloak with the symbol of the Knights Radiant on the\nback. “I haven’t shown anyone my powers. There have to be others training\nas I am. Storms, Syl all but promised me there were.”\n“He’d have displayed the abilities if he had them,” Sigzil said. “Gossip\nis moving through the ten warcamps like floodwater. Half the people think\nit’s blasphemous and stupid, what Dalinar is doing. The other half are\nundecided. If Amaram displayed Surgebinding powers, Brightlord Dalinar’s\nmove would look a lot less precarious.”\nSigzil was probably right. But… Amaram? The man walked with such\npride, head held high. Kaladin felt his neck growing hot, and for a moment\nit seemed the only thing he could see was Amaram. Golden cloak. Haughty\nface.\nBloodstained. That man was bloodstained. Kaladin told Dalinar about\nit!\nDalinar wouldn’t do anything.\nSomeone else would have to.\n“Kaladin?” Sigzil asked.\nKaladin realized he’d stepped toward Amaram, hands clenched on his\nspear. He took a deep breath, then pointed. “Put men up on the rim of the\narena there. Skar and Eth are in the preparation room with Adolin, for all\nthe good it will do him out on the field. Put another few down at the arena\nbottom, just in case. Three men at every door. I’ll take six with me to the\nking’s seats.” Kaladin paused, then added, “Let’s also put two men guarding\nAdolin’s betrothed, just in case. She’ll be sitting with Sebarial.”\n“Will do.”\n“Tell the men to keep focused, Sig. This is likely to be a dramatic fight.\nI want their minds on the possibility of assassins, not on the duel.”\n“Is he really going to fight two men at once?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Can he possibly win that?”\n“I don’t know, and I don’t really care. Our job is to watch for other\nthreats.”\nSigzil nodded, and moved to leave. He hesitated, however, taking\nKaladin by the arm. “You could join them, Kal,” he said softly. “If the\nking’s refounding the Knights Radiant, you have an excuse to show what\nyou are. Dalinar is trying, but so many think of the Radiants as an evil\nforce, forgetting the good they did before they betrayed mankind. But if you\nshowed your powers, it could change minds.”\nJoin. Under Amaram. Not likely.\n“Go pass my orders,” Kaladin said, gesturing, then pulled his arm free\nof Sigzil’s grip and jogged after the king and his retinue. At least the sun\nwas out today, the spring air warm.\nSyl bobbed along behind Kaladin. “Amaram is ruining you, Kaladin,”\nshe whispered. “Don’t let him.”"

Instead, he moved up beside\nMoash, who was in charge of a team who would watch Brightness Navani\n—she preferred to watch the duels from down below, in the preparation\nrooms.\nA part of him wondered if he should let Moash guard anyone other than\nDalinar, but storm it, Moash had sworn to him that he’d take no more\nactions against the king. Kaladin trusted him on that count. They were\nBridge Four.\nI’ll get you out of this, Moash, Kaladin thought, pulling the man aside.\nWe’ll fix this.\n“Moash,” Kaladin said, speaking softly. “Starting tomorrow, I’m putting\nyou on patrol duty.”\nMoash frowned. “I thought you always wanted me guarding…” His\nexpression grew hard. “This is about what happened. In the tavern.”\n“I want you to take a deep patrol,” Kaladin said. “Head out toward New\nNatanan. I don’t want you here when we move against Graves and his\npeople.” It had been too long already.\n“I’m not leaving.”\n“You will, and it’s not subject to—”\n“What they’re doing is right, Kal!”\nKaladin frowned. “Have you still been meeting with them?”\nMoash looked away. “Only once. To assure them that you’d come\naround.”\n“You still disobeyed an order!” Kaladin said. “Storm it, Moash!”\nThe noise inside the arena was building.\n“Almost time for the match,” Moash said, pulling his arm free of\nKaladin’s grip. “We can talk about this later.”\nKaladin ground his teeth, but unfortunately, Moash was right. This\nwasn’t the time.\nShould have grabbed him this morning, Kaladin thought. No, what I\nshould have done was make a decision on this days ago.\nIt was his own fault. “You will go on that patrol, Moash,” he said. “You\ndon’t get to be insubordinate just because you’re my friend. Go on.”\nThe man jogged ahead, collecting his squad.\n* * *\nAdolin knelt beside his sword in the preparation room and found he\ndidn’t know what to say.\nHe looked at his reflection in the Blade. Two Shardbearers at once. He’d\nnever even tried that outside of the practice grounds.\nFighting multiple opponents was tough. In the histories, if you heard of\na man fighting six men at once or whatnot, the truth was probably that he\nmanaged to take them one at a time somehow. Two at once was hard, if they\nwere prepared and careful. Not impossible, but really hard.\n“It comes down to this,” Adolin said. He had to say something to the\nsword. It was tradition. “Let’s go be spectacular. Then let’s wipe that smile\noff Sadeas’s face.”\nHe stood up, dismissing his Blade.

Aunt\nNavani was screwing the lid off a jar of paint to do a glyphward.\n“No need,” Adolin said, taking one from his pocket. Painted in Kholin\nblue, it read “excellence.”\nNavani cocked an eyebrow. “The girl?”\n“Yeah,” Adolin said.\n“The calligraphy isn’t bad,” Navani said, grudgingly.\n“She’s quite wonderful, Aunt,” Adolin said. “I wish you’d give her more\nof a chance. And she does want to share her scholarship with you.”\n“We’ll see,” Navani said. She sounded more thoughtful than she had\nbefore, regarding Shallan. A good sign.\nAdolin placed the glyphward in the brazier, then bowed his head as it\nburned. A prayer to the Almighty for aid. His combatants for the day would\nprobably be burning their own prayers. How did the Almighty decide whom\nto help?\nI can’t believe, Adolin thought, raising his head from the prayer, that\nhe’d want those who serve Sadeas, even indirectly, to succeed.\n“I’m worried,” Navani said.\n“Father thinks the plan could work, and Elhokar really likes it.”\n“Elhokar can be impulsive,” Navani said, folding her arms and\nwatching the remnants of the glyphward burn. “The terms change things.”\nThe terms—agreed upon with Relis and spoken in front of the\nhighjudge just earlier—indicated that this duel would go until surrender, not\nuntil a certain number of Plate sections were broken. That meant if Adolin\ndid manage to beat one of his foes, making the man give in, the other could\nkeep fighting.\nIt also meant that Adolin didn’t have to stop fighting until he was\nconvinced he was bested.\nOr until he was incapacitated.\nRenarin walked over, resting a hand on Adolin’s shoulder. “I think the\nplan is a good one,” he said. “You can do this.”\n“They’re going to try to break you,” Navani said. “That’s why they\ninsisted this be a match until the surrender. They’ll leave you crippled if\nthey can, Adolin.”\n“No different from the battlefield,” he said. “Actually, in this case, they\nwill want to leave me alive. I’ll work better as an object lesson with Blade-\ndead legs than I would as ashes.”\nNavani closed her eyes, drawing in a breath. She looked pale. It was a\nlittle like having his mother back. A little.\n“Make sure you don’t give Sadeas any outs,” Renarin said to him as the\narmorers entered with Adolin’s Shardplate. “When you corner him with a\nchallenge, he will look for a way to escape. Don’t let him. Bring him down\non those sands and beat him bloody, Brother.”\n“With pleasure.”\n“Now, you ate chicken?” Renarin asked.\n“Two plates of the stuff, with curry.”\n“Mother’s chain?”\nAdolin felt in his pocket.\nThen he felt in his other one.\n“What?” Renarin asked, fingers tightening on Adolin’s shoulder."

On my\nend table.” Assuming he hadn’t grabbed it, then lost it on the way. Storms.\nIt was just a good luck charm. It didn’t mean anything. He started\nsweating anyway as Renarin scrambled to send a runner off to search. They\nwouldn’t get back in time. Already he could hear the crowd outside, the\ngrowing roar that came before a duel. Adolin reluctantly allowed his\narmorers to begin putting on his Plate.\nBy the time they gave him his helm, he had recovered most of his\nrhythm—the anticipation that was an odd blend of anxiety in his stomach\nand relaxation in his muscles. You couldn’t fight while tense. You could\nfight while nervous, but not while tense.\nHe nodded to the servants, and they pushed open the doors, letting him\nstride out onto the sand. He could tell from their cheering where the\ndarkeyes sat. In contrast, the lighteyes grew softer, instead of louder, when\nhe emerged. It was good that Elhokar reserved space for the darkeyes.\nAdolin liked the noise. It reminded him of a battlefield.\nThere was a time, he thought, when I didn’t like the battlefield because\nit wasn’t quiet, like a duel. Despite his original reluctance, he had become a\nsoldier.\nHe strode out into the center of the arena. The others hadn’t left their\npreparation room yet. Take Relis first, Adolin told himself. You know his\ndueling style. The man preferred Vinestance, slow and steady, but with\nsudden, quick lunges. Adolin wasn’t sure whom he’d bring along to fight\nwith him, though he’d borrowed a full set of the King’s Blade and Plate.\nPerhaps his cousin wanted to try again, for vengeance?\nShallan was there, on the opposite side of the arena, her red hair\nstanding out like blood on stone. She had two bridgeman guards. Adolin\nfound himself nodding in appreciation of that, and raised a fist to her. She\nwaved back.\nAdolin danced from one foot to the other, letting the power of the Plate\nflow through him. He could win, even without Mother’s chain. The problem\nwas, he intended to challenge Sadeas after this. So he had to retain enough\nstrength for that duel.\nHe checked, anxious. Was Sadeas there? Yes; he sat only a little ways\nfrom Father and the king. Adolin narrowed his eyes, remembering the\ncrushing moment of realization when he’d seen Sadeas’s armies retreating\nfrom the Tower.\nThat steadied him. He’d stewed long about that betrayal. It was time,\nfinally, to do something.\nThe doors across from him opened.\nFour men in Shardplate strode out.\n* * *\n“Four?” Dalinar said, leaping to his feet.\nKaladin took a step downward toward the arena floor.

One wore a\nset of the King’s Plate; the other three wore their own, ornamented and\npainted.\nDown below, the highjudge for the bout turned and cocked her head\ntoward the king.\n“What is this?” Dalinar bellowed toward Sadeas, who sat only a short\ndistance away. The lighteyes on the benchlike rows of seats between them\nhunched down or fled, leaving a direct line of sight between the\nhighprinces.\nSadeas and his wife turned about, lazily. “Why do you ask me?” Sadeas\ncalled back. “None of those men are mine. I’m just an observer today.”\n“Oh, don’t be tiresome, Sadeas,” Elhokar called. “You know full well\nwhat is happening. Why are there four? Is Adolin supposed to pick the two\nhe wants to duel?”\n“Two?” Sadeas asked. “When was it said that he would fight two?”\n“That’s what he said when he set up the duel!” Dalinar shouted. “Paired\ndisadvantaged duel, two against one, as per the dueling conventions!”\n“Actually,” Sadeas replied, “that is not what young Adolin agreed to.\nWhy, I have it on very good authority that he told Prince Relis: ‘I’ll fight\nyou and whomever you bring.’ I don’t hear a specification of a number in\nthere—which subjects Adolin to a full disadvantaged duel, not a paired\nduel. Relis may bring as many as he wishes. I know several scribes who\nrecorded Adolin’s precise words, and I hear the highjudge asked him\nspecifically if he understood what he was doing, and he said that he did.”\nDalinar growled softly. It was a sound Kaladin had never heard from\nhim, the growl of a beast on a chain. It surprised him. The highprince\ncontained himself, however, sitting down with a curt motion.\n“He outthought us,” Dalinar said softly to the king. “Again. We’ll need\nto retreat and consider our next move. Someone tell Adolin to pull out of\nthe contest.”\n“Are you certain?” the king said. “Pulling out would require that Adolin\nforfeit, Uncle. That’s six Shards, I believe. Everything you own.”\nKaladin could read the conflict in Dalinar’s features—the scrunched-up\nbrow, the red fury rising on his cheeks, the indecision in his eyes. Give up?\nWithout a fight? It was probably the right thing to do.\nKaladin doubted he could have done it.\nBelow, after an extended pause—frozen on the sand—Adolin raised his\nhand in a sign of agreement. The judge began the duel.\n* * *\nI’m an idiot. I’m an idiot. I’m a storm-cursed idiot!\nAdolin jogged backward across the sand-covered circle of the arena.\nHe’d need to put his back to the wall to avoid being completely surrounded.\nThat meant he’d start the duel with no place to retreat, locked in a box.\nCornered.\nWhy hadn’t he been more specific?

But no,\ndoing so would have been smart. And Adolin was a storming idiot!\nHe recognized Relis from his Plate and Blade, colored completely a\ndeep black, breakaway cloak bearing his father’s glyphpair. The man in\nKing’s Plate—judging by his height and the way he walked—would indeed\nbe Elit, Relis’s cousin, returned for a rematch. He carried an enormous\nhammer, rather than a Blade. The two moved across the field carefully, and\ntheir two companions took the flanks. One in orange, the other in green.\nAdolin recognized the Plate. That would be Abrobadar, a full\nShardbearer from Aladar’s camp and… and Jakamav, bearing the King’s\nBlade that Relis had borrowed.\nJakamav. Adolin’s friend.\nAdolin cursed. Those two were among the best duelists in the camp.\nJakamav would have won his own Blade years ago if he’d been allowed to\nrisk his Plate. That had apparently changed. Had he, and his house, been\nbought with a promise of a share in the spoils?\nBlade forming in his hand, Adolin backed into the cool shade of the\nwall around the arena grounds. Just above him, darkeyes roared on their\nbenches. Whether they were thrilled or horrified by what he faced, Adolin\ncould not tell. He’d come here intending to give a spectacular show. They’d\nget the opposite instead. A quick slaughter.\nWell, he’d made this pyre himself. If he was going to burn on it, he’d at\nleast put up a fight first.\nRelis and Elit prowled closer—one in slate grey, the other in black—as\ntheir allies worked around the sides. Those would hang back to try to make\nAdolin focus on the two in front of him. Then the others could attack him\nfrom the sides.\n“One at a time, lad!” One shout from the stands seemed to separate\nfrom the others. Was that Zahel’s voice? “You’re not cornered!”\nRelis stepped forward in a quick motion, testing Adolin. Adolin danced\naway in Windstance—certainly the best against so many foes—with both\nhands holding the Blade in front of him, positioned sideways with one foot\nforward.\nYou’re not cornered! What did Zahel mean? Of course he was cornered!\nIt was the only way to face four. And how could he possibly face them one\nat a time? They’d never allow that.\nRelis tested forward again, making Adolin shuffle sideways along the\nwall, focused on him. He had to turn somewhat to face Relis, however, and\nthat put Abrobadar—moving up the other way, wearing orange—in his\nblind spot. Storms!\n“They’re scared of you.” Zahel’s voice, drifting again above the crowd.\n“Do you see it in them? Show them why.”\nAdolin hesitated. Relis stepped forward, making a Stonestance strike.\nStonestance, to be immobile. Elit came in next, hammer held wardingly."

Elit came in next, hammer held wardingly.\nThey backed Adolin along the wall toward Abrobadar.\nNo. Adolin had demanded this duel. He had wanted it. He would not\nbecome a frightened rat.\nShow them why.\nAdolin attacked. He leaped forward, sweeping with a barrage of strikes\nat Relis. Elit jumped away with a curse as he did so. They were like men\nwith spears prodding at a whitespine.\nAnd this whitespine was not yet caged.\nAdolin shouted, beating against Relis, scoring strikes on his helm and\nleft vambrace, cracking the latter. Stormlight rose from Relis’s forearm. As\nElit recovered, Adolin spun on him and struck, leaving Relis dazed from the\nattack. His assault forced Elit to hold his hammer back and block with his\nforearm, lest Adolin slice the hammer in two and leave him unarmed.\nThis was what Zahel meant. Attack with fury. Don’t allow them time to\nrespond or assess. Four men. If he could intimidate them into hesitating…\nMaybe…\nAdolin stopped thinking. He let the flow of the fight consume him, let\nthe rhythm of his heart guide the beating of his sword. Elit cursed and\npulled away, leaking Stormlight from his left shoulder and forearm.\nAdolin turned and smashed his shoulder into Relis, who was stepping\nback into his stance. His shove threw the black-Plated man tumbling to the\nground. Then, with a shout, Adolin turned and met Abrobadar head-on as\nthe man came dashing up to help. Adolin fell into Stonestance himself,\nsmashing his Blade down again and again against Abrobadar’s raised sword\nuntil he heard grunts, curses. Until he could feel the fear coming off the man\nin orange like a stench, and could see fearspren on the ground.\nElit approached, wary, as Relis scrambled up to his feet. Adolin fell\nback into Windstance and swept about himself in a wide, fluid motion. Elit\njumped away and Abrobadar stumbled back, gauntleted hand against the\nwall of the arena.\nAdolin turned back toward Relis, who had recovered well, all things\nconsidered. Still, Adolin got in a second strike at the champion’s\nbreastplate. If this had been a battlefield and these common foes, Relis\nwould be dead, Elit maimed. Adolin was yet untouched.\nBut they weren’t common foes. They were Shardbearers, and a second\nstrike against Relis’s breastplate didn’t break the armor. Adolin was forced\nto turn on Abrobadar before he wanted to, and the man was now braced for\nthe fury of the assault, sword raised defensively. Adolin’s barrage didn’t\nstun him this time. The man weathered it while Elit and Relis got into\nposition.\nJust need to—\nSomething crashed into Adolin from behind.\nJakamav.

He raised his sword into\nJakamav’s next attack, but that opened his left flank. Elit swung, hammer\ncrashing into Adolin’s side. Plate cracked, and the blow shoved Adolin off\nbalance.\nHe swept around himself, growing desperate. This time, his foes didn’t\nback away. Instead, Jakamav charged in, head down, not even swinging.\nSmart man. His green armor was unscored. Even though the move let\nAdolin slam his sword down and hit the man on the back, it threw Adolin\ncompletely out of his stance.\nAdolin stumbled backward, barely keeping from being thrown to the\nground as Jakamav crashed into him. Adolin shoved the man aside,\nsomehow keeping hold of his Shardblade, but the other three moved in.\nBlows rained on his shoulders, helm, breastplate. Storms. That hammer hit\nhard.\nAdolin’s head rang from a blow. He’d almost done it. He let himself\ngrin as they beat on him. Four at once. And he’d almost done it.\n“I yield,” he said, voice muffled by his helm.\nThey continued attacking. He said it louder.\nNobody listened.\nHe raised his hand to signal to the judge to stop the proceedings, but\nsomeone slammed his arm downward.\nNo! Adolin thought, swinging about himself in a panic.\nThe judge could not end the fight. If he left this duel alive, he would do\nso as a cripple.\n* * *\n“That’s it,” Dalinar said, watching the four Shardbearers take turns\ncoming in to swing at Adolin, who was obviously disoriented, barely able to\nfight them off. “The rules allow Adolin to have help, so long as his side is\ndisadvantaged—one less than Relis’s team. Elhokar, I’ll need your\nShardblade.”\n“No,” Elhokar said. The king sat with folded arms beneath the shade.\nThose around them watched the duel… no, the beating… in silence.\n“Elhokar!” Dalinar said, turning. “That is my son.”\n“You’re without Plate,” Elhokar said. “If you take the time to put some\non, you’ll be too late. If you go down, you won’t save Adolin. You’ll simply\nlose my Blade as well as all the others.”\nDalinar clenched his teeth. There was a drop of wisdom in that, and he\nknew it. Adolin was finished. They needed to end the match now and not\nput more on the line.\n“You could help him, you know.” Sadeas’s voice.\nDalinar spun toward the man.\n“The dueling conventions don’t forbid it,” Sadeas said, speaking loudly\nenough for Dalinar to hear. “I checked to make sure. Young Adolin can be\nhelped by up to two people. The Blackthorn I once knew would have been\ndown there already, fighting with a rock if he had to.

I’m going to fight.”\nElhokar caught him by the arm, standing. “Don’t be a fool, Uncle.\nListen to him! Do you see what he’s doing? He obviously wants you to go\ndown and fight.”\nDalinar turned to meet the king’s eyes. Pale green. Like his father’s.\n“Uncle,” Elhokar said, grip tightening on his arm, “listen to me for\nonce. Be a little paranoid. Why would Sadeas want you down there? It’s so\nthat an ‘accident’ can occur! He wants you removed, Dalinar. I guarantee\nthat if you step onto those sands, all four will attack you straight out.\nShardblade or none, you’ll be dead before you get into stance.”\nDalinar puffed in and out. Elhokar was right. Storm him, but he was\nright. Dalinar had to do something though.\nA murmur rose from the watching crowd, whispers like scratches on\npaper. Dalinar spun to see that someone else had joined the battle, stepping\nfrom the preparation room, Shardblade held nervously in two hands but\nwearing no Plate.\nRenarin.\nOh no…\n* * *\nOne of the attackers moved away, Plated feet crunching on sand. Adolin\nthrew himself in that direction, battering his way out from among the three\nothers. He spun and backed away. His Plate was starting to feel heavy. How\nmuch Stormlight had he lost?\nNo broken sections, he thought, keeping his sword toward the three\nother men who fanned out to advance on him. He could maybe…\nNo. Time to end this. He felt a fool, but better a live fool than a dead\none. He turned toward the highjudge to signal his surrender. Surely she\ncould see him now.\n“Adolin,” Relis said, prowling forward, his Plate leaking from small\ncracks on his chest. “Now, we wouldn’t want to end this prematurely, would\nwe?”\n“What glory do you think will come of such a fight?” Adolin spat back,\nsword held carefully, ready to give the signal. “You think people will cheer\nyou? For beating a man four against one?”\n“This isn’t for honor,” Relis said. “It’s simple punishment.”\nAdolin snorted. Only then did he notice something on the other side of\nthe arena. Renarin in Kholin blue, holding a wobbly Shardblade and facing\ndown Abrobadar, who stood with sword on his shoulder as if completely\nunthreatened.\n“Renarin!” Adolin shouted. “What in the storms are you doing! Go back\n—”\nAbrobadar attacked, and Renarin parried awkwardly. Renarin had done\nall of his sparring in Shardplate so far, but hadn’t had the time to fetch his\nPlate. Abrobadar’s blow just about knocked the weapon from Renarin’s\nhands.\n“Now,” Relis said, stepping closer to Adolin, “Abrobadar there is fond\nof young Renarin, and doesn’t want to hurt him.

So he’ll just keep the\nyoung man engaged, make a good fight of it. So long as you’re willing to\nkeep up what you promised, and have a good duel with us. Surrender like a\ncoward, or get the king to end the bout, and Abrobadar’s sword might just\nslip.”\nAdolin felt a panic rising. He looked toward the highjudge. She could\ncall this on her own, if she felt it had gone too far.\nShe sat imperiously in her seat, watching him. Adolin thought he saw\nsomething behind her calm expression. They got to her, he thought. With a\nbribe, perhaps.\nAdolin tightened his grip on his Blade and looked back toward his three\nfoes. “You bastards,” he whispered. “Jakamav, how dare you be a part of\nthis?”\nJakamav didn’t reply, and Adolin could not see his face behind his green\nhelm.\n“So,” Relis said. “Shall we?”\nAdolin’s response was a charge.\n* * *\nDalinar reached the judge’s seat, which sat on its own small, stone dais\nhanging out a few inches over the dueling grounds.\nBrightness Istow was a tall, greying woman who sat with hands in her\nlap, watching the duel. She did not turn as Dalinar stepped up beside her.\n“It is time to end this, Istow,” Dalinar said. “Call the fight. Award the\nvictory to Relis and his team.”\nThe woman kept her eyes forward, watching the duel.\n“Did you hear me?” Dalinar demanded.\nShe said nothing.\n“Fine,” he said. “I’ll end it then.”\n“I am highprince here, Dalinar,” the woman said. “In this arena, my\nword is the only law, granted me by the authority of the king.” She turned to\nhim. “Your son has not surrendered and he is not incapacitated. The terms\nof the duel have not been met, and I will not end it until they have been.\nHave you no respect for the law?”\nDalinar ground his teeth together, then looked back at the arena. Renarin\nfought one of the men. The lad had barely any training in the sword. In fact,\nas Dalinar watched, Renarin’s shoulder began to twitch, pulling up toward\nhis head violently. One of his fits.\nAdolin fought the other three, having cast himself among them again.\nHe fought marvelously, but could not fend off all of them. The three\nsurrounded him and struck.\nThe pauldron on Adolin’s left shoulder exploded into a burst of molten\nmetal, bits trailing smoke through the air, the main chunk of it skidding to\nthe sands a short distance away. That left Adolin’s flesh exposed to the air,\nand to the Blades facing him.\nPlease… Almighty…\nDalinar turned upon the stands full of spectating lighteyes. “You can\nwatch this?” he shouted at them. “My sons fight alone!

Dalinar found him seated near the king. Dalinar met the man’s\neyes.\nAmaram looked away.\nNo…\n“What has happened to us?” Dalinar asked. “Where is our honor?”\n“Honor is dead,” a voice whispered from beside him.\nDalinar turned and looked at Captain Kaladin. He hadn’t noticed the\nbridgeman walking down the steps behind him.\nKaladin took a deep breath, then looked at Dalinar. “But I’ll see what I\ncan do. If this goes poorly, take care of my men.” Spear in hand, he grabbed\nthe edge of the wall and flung himself over, dropping to the sands of the\narena floor below.\n57. To Kill the Wind\nMalchin was stymied, for though he was\ninferior to none in the arts of war, he was not\nsuitable for the Lightweavers; he wished for his\noaths to be elementary and straightforward, and\nyet their spren were liberal, as to our\ncomprehension, in definitions pertaining to this\nmatter; the process included speaking truths as an\napproach to a threshold of self-awareness that\nMalchin could never attain.\nFrom Words of Radiance, chapter 12, page\n12\nShallan stood up in her seat, watching Adolin’s beating below. Why\ndidn’t he surrender? Give up the bout?\nFour men. She should have seen that loophole. As his wife, watching\nfor intrigue like this would be her duty. Now, barely betrothed, she’d\nalready failed him disastrously. Beyond that, this fiasco had been her idea.\nAdolin seemed about to give in, but then for some reason, he threw\nhimself back into the fight instead.\n“Fool man,” Sebarial said, lounging beside her, Palona on his other side.\n“Too arrogant to see that he’s beaten.”\n“No,” Shallan said. “There’s something more.” Her eyes flicked down\ntoward poor Renarin, completely overwhelmed as he tried to fight a\nShardbearer.\nFor the briefest instant, she considered going down to help. Sheer\nstupidity; she’d be even more useless than Renarin down there. Why didn’t\nanyone else help them? She glared across at the gathered Alethi lighteyes,\nincluding Highlord Amaram, the supposed Knight Radiant.\nBastard.\nShocked at how quickly that sentiment rose inside of her, Shallan\nlooked away from him. Don’t think about it. Well, as nobody was going to\nhelp, both princes seemed to stand a good chance of dying.\n“Pattern,” she whispered. “Go see if you can distract that Shardbearer\nfighting Prince Renarin.” She would not interfere with Adolin’s fight, not as\nhe’d obviously decided he needed to keep going for some reason. But she\nwould try to keep Renarin from getting maimed, if she could.\nPattern hummed and slipped from her skirt, moving across the stone of\nthe arena benches. He seemed painfully obvious to her, moving in the open,\nbut everybody was focused on the fighting below.\nDon’t you get yourself killed on me, Adolin Kholin, she thought,"

He’d trusted her and spoken to Dalinar about Amaram. That had\ngone wonderfully.\nOne of the Shardbearers—Relis, the one in black armor—trailed\nStormlight from a crack in the vambrace on his left forearm. He glanced at\nKaladin as he approached, then turned back away, indifferent. Relis\nobviously didn’t think a simple spearman was a threat.\nKaladin smiled, then sucked in some Stormlight. On this bright day,\nwith the sun blazing white overhead, he could risk more than he normally\nwould. Nobody would see it. Hopefully.\nHe sped up, then lunged between two of the Shardbearers, ramming his\nspear into Relis’s cracked vambrace. The man let out a shout of pain and\nKaladin pulled his spear back, twisting between the attackers and getting\nclose to Adolin. The young man in blue armor glanced at him, then quickly\nturned to put his back toward Kaladin.\nKaladin put his own back toward Adolin, preventing either of them\nfrom being attacked from behind.\n“What are you doing here, bridgeboy?” Adolin hissed from within his\nhelmet.\n“Playing one of the ten fools.”\nAdolin grunted. “Welcome to the party.”\n“I won’t be able to get through their armor,” Kaladin said. “You’ll need\nto crack it for me.” Nearby, Relis shook his arm, cursing. The tip of\nKaladin’s spear had blood on it. Not much, unfortunately.\n“Just keep one of them distracted from me,” Adolin said. “I can handle\ntwo.”\n“I— All right.” It was probably the best plan.\n“Keep an eye on my brother, if you can,” Adolin said. “If things go sour\nfor these three, they might decide to use him as leverage against us.”\n“Done,” Kaladin said, then pulled away and jumped to the side as the\none with a hammer—Dalinar had named him Elit—tried to attack Adolin.\nRelis came in from the other side, swinging, as if to cut right through\nKaladin and hit Adolin.\nHis heart thumped, but training with Zahel had done its job. He could\nstare down that Shardblade and feel only a mild panic. He twisted around\nRelis, dodging the Blade.\nThe black-Plated man glanced at Adolin and took a step in that\ndirection, but Kaladin lunged as if to strike him in the arm again.\nRelis turned back, then reluctantly let Kaladin draw him away from the\nfight with Adolin. The man attacked quickly, using what Kaladin could now\nidentify as Vinestance—a style of fighting that focused on defensive footing\nand flexibility."

The man attacked quickly, using what Kaladin could now\nidentify as Vinestance—a style of fighting that focused on defensive footing\nand flexibility.\nHe went more offensive against Kaladin, but Kaladin twisted and spun,\nalways getting just out of the way of the attacks. Relis started cursing, then\nturned back to the fight with Adolin.\nKaladin slapped him on the side of the head with the butt of his spear. It\nwas a terrible weapon for fighting a Shardbearer, but the blow got the man’s\nattention again. Relis turned and swept out with his Blade.\nKaladin pulled back a hair too slowly, and the Blade sheared the pointed\nend off his spear. A reminder. His own flesh would put up less resistance\nthan that. Severing his spine would kill him, and no amount of Stormlight\nwould undo that.\nCareful, he tried to lead Relis farther away from the fight. However,\nwhen he pulled back too far, the man just turned and moved toward Adolin.\nThe prince fought desperately against his two opponents, swinging his\nBlade back and forth between the men on either side of him. And storms he\nwas good. Kaladin had never seen this level of skill from Adolin on the\npractice grounds—nothing there had ever challenged him this much. Adolin\nmoved between sweeps of his Blade, deflecting the Shardblade of the one in\ngreen, then warding away the one with the hammer.\nHe frequently came within inches of striking his opponents. Two-on-one\nagainst Adolin actually seemed an even match.\nThree would obviously be too much for him. Kaladin needed to keep\nRelis distracted. But how? He couldn’t get through that Plate with a spear.\nThe only weak points were the eye slit and the small crack on the vambrace.\nHe had to do something. The man was striding back toward Adolin,\nweapon raised. Gritting his teeth, Kaladin charged.\nHe crossed the sands in a quick dash and then, right before reaching\nRelis, Kaladin jumped to put his feet toward the Shardbearer and Lashed\nhimself that direction many times in quick succession. As many as he dared,\nso many that he burned through all of his Stormlight.\nThough Kaladin fell only a short distance—enough that it wouldn’t look\ntoo unusual to those watching—he hit with the force of having fallen much\nfarther. His feet smashed against the Plate as he kicked with everything he\nhad.\nPain shot up his legs like lightning striking, and he heard his bones\ncrack. The kick flung the black-armored Shardbearer forward as if he’d\nbeen struck by a boulder. Relis went sprawling on his face, Blade flung\nfrom his hands. It vanished to mist.\nKaladin crashed to the sand, groaning, his Stormlight exhausted and the\nLashings ended. By reflex, he sucked in more Light from the spheres in his\npocket, letting it heal his legs. He’d broken them both, and his feet.\nThe healing process seemed to take forever, and he forced himself to\nroll over and look at Relis. Incredibly, Kaladin’s attack had cracked the\nShardplate. Not the center of the back plate where he’d hit, but at the\nshoulders and sides. Relis climbed to his knees, shaking his head. He\nlooked back at Kaladin with what seemed like an attitude of awe."

He\nlooked back at Kaladin with what seemed like an attitude of awe.\nBeyond the fallen man, Adolin spun and came in at one of his\nopponents—Elit, the one with the hammer—and slammed his Shardblade\ntwo-handed into the man’s chest. The breastplate there exploded into\nmolten light. Adolin took a hit on the side of the helm from the man in\ngreen to do it.\nAdolin was in bad shape. Practically every piece of Plate the young man\nwore was leaking Stormlight. At this rate, he’d soon have none left, and the\nPlate would grow too heavy to move in.\nFor now, fortunately, he’d basically incapacitated one of his adversaries.\nA Shardbearer could fight with his breastplate broken, but it was supposed\nto be storming difficult. Indeed, as Elit backed away, his steps were\nawkward, as if his Plate suddenly weighed a lot more.\nAdolin had to turn to fight the other Shardbearer near him. On the other\nside of the arena, the fourth man—the one who had been “fighting” Renarin\n—was waving his sword at the ground for some reason. He looked up and\nsaw how poorly things were going for his allies, then left Renarin and\ndashed across the arena floor.\n“Wait,” Syl said. “What is that?” She zipped away toward Renarin, but\nKaladin couldn’t spare much thought for her behavior. When the man in\norange reached Adolin, he’d again be surrounded.\nKaladin scrambled to his feet. Blessedly, they worked; the bones had\nreknit enough for him to walk. He charged Elit, kicking up sand as he ran,\nspear clutched in one hand.\nElit wobbled toward Adolin, intending to continue the fight despite his\ndisabled Plate. Kaladin reached him first, however, ducking under the man’s\nhasty hammer strike. Kaladin came in swinging from the shoulder, holding\nhis broken spear in two hands, giving the attack all he had.\nIt smashed into Elit’s exposed chest, making a satisfying crunch. The\nman let out an enormous gasp, doubling over. Kaladin raised his spear to\nswing again, but the man lifted a wobbling hand, trying to say something.\n“Yield…” his weak voice said.\n“Louder!” Kaladin snapped at him.\nThe man tried, out of breath. The hand he raised, however, was enough.\nThe watching judge spoke. “Brightlord Elit yields the combat,” she said,\nsounding reluctant.\nKaladin backed away from the cowering man, light on his feet,\nStormlight thundering inside of him. The crowd roared, even many of the\nlighteyes making noise.\nThree Shardbearers remained. Relis had now returned to his companion\nin green, both harrying Adolin. They had the prince backed up against a\nwall. The final Shardbearer, wearing orange, arrived to join them, having\nleft Renarin behind.\nRenarin sat on the sand, head bowed, Shardblade stuck into the ground\nbefore him. Had he been defeated?

Relis\nscored a hit on his helm, and the thing exploded, exposing the prince’s face.\nHe would not last much longer.\nKaladin charged up to Elit, who was trying to hobble off the field in\ndefeat. “Remove your helm,” Kaladin shouted at him.\nThe man turned to him with a shocked posture.\n“Your helm!” Kaladin screamed, raising his weapon to strike again.\nIn the stands, people shouted. Kaladin wasn’t sure of the rules, but he\nhad a suspicion that if he struck this man, he would forfeit the duel. Maybe\neven face criminal charges. Fortunately, he wasn’t forced to make good on\nthe threat, as Elit removed his helm. Kaladin snatched it from his hand, then\nleft him and ran toward Adolin.\nAs he ran, Kaladin dropped his broken spear and shoved his hand into\nthe helm from the bottom. He’d learned something about Shardplate—it\nattached itself automatically to its bearer. He’d hoped it might work for the\nhelm now, and it did—the inside tightened around his wrist. When he let go,\nthe helm remained on his hand like a very strange glove.\nTaking a deep breath, Kaladin yanked out his side knife. He’d started\ncarrying one meant for throwing again, as he had as a spearman before his\ncaptivity, though he was out of practice with that. Throwing wouldn’t work\nagainst that armor anyway; this was a pitiful weapon against Shardbearers.\nStill, he could not use the spear one-handed. He charged Relis again.\nThis time, Relis backed away immediately. He watched Kaladin, sword\nheld out. At least Kaladin had managed to worry him.\nKaladin advanced, backing him away. Relis went easily, keeping his\ndistance. Kaladin made a show of it, darting in, backing the man away as if\nto give the two of them space to fight. The Shardbearer would be eager for\nthis; with his Blade, he would want a good open area around them. Tight\nquarters would favor Kaladin’s knife.\nHowever, once a sufficient distance away, Kaladin turned and dashed\nback toward Adolin and the two men he was fighting. He left Relis standing\nthere in an anxious pose, momentarily befuddled by Kaladin’s retreat.\nAdolin glanced at Kaladin, then nodded.\nThe man in green turned with surprise at Kaladin’s advance. He swung,\nand Kaladin caught the blow on the Shardplate helm he carried, deflecting\nit. The man grunted as Adolin threw everything he had at the other\nShardbearer, the one in orange, slamming his weapon down again and\nagain.\nFor a short time, Adolin had only one foe to fight. Hopefully he could\nuse that time well, though his steps were lethargic and his Plate’s leaking\nStormlight had slowed to a trickle. His legs were nearly immobile.\nGreen Plate attacked Kaladin again, who deflected the blow off the\nhelm, which cracked and began leaking Stormlight. Relis came charging up\non the other side, but didn’t join the fight against Adolin—instead, he thrust\nat Kaladin.\nKaladin gritted his teeth, dodging to the side, feeling the Blade pass in"

He had to buy Adolin time. Moments. He needed moments.\nThe wind began to blow around him. Syl returned to him, zipping\nthrough the air as a ribbon of light.\nKaladin ducked another blow, then slammed his improvised shield\nagainst the Blade of the other, throwing it back. Sand flew as Kaladin\nleaped back, a Shardblade biting the ground before him.\nWind. Motion. Kaladin fought two Shardbearers at once, knocking their\nBlades aside with the helm. He couldn’t attack—didn’t dare try to attack.\nHe could only survive, and in this, the winds seemed to urge him.\nInstinct… then something deeper… guided his steps. He danced\nbetween those Blades, cool air wrapping around him. And for a moment, he\nfelt—impossibly—that he could have dodged just as well if his eyes had\nbeen closed.\nThe Shardbearers cursed, trying again and again. Kaladin heard the\njudge say something, but was too absorbed in the fight to pay attention. The\ncrowd was growing louder. He leaped one attack, then stepped just to the\nside of another.\nYou could not kill the wind. You could not stop it. It was beyond the\ntouch of men. It was infinite…\nHis Stormlight ran out.\nKaladin stumbled to a halt. He tried to suck in more, but all of his\nspheres were drained.\nThe helm, he realized, noticing that it was gushing Stormlight from its\nnumerous cracks, yet hadn’t exploded. It had somehow fed upon his\nStormlight.\nRelis attacked and Kaladin barely scrambled out of the way. His back\nhit the wall of the arena.\nGreen Plate saw his opening and raised his Blade.\nSomeone hopped on him from behind.\nKaladin watched, dumbfounded, as Adolin grappled Green Plate,\nlatching on to him. Adolin’s armor hardly leaked at all anymore; his\nStormlight was exhausted. It seemed that he could barely move—the sand\nnearby displayed a set of lurching tracks that led away from Orange Plate,\nwho lay in the sand defeated.\nThat was what the judge had said just earlier: the man in orange had\nyielded. Adolin had beaten his foe, then walked slowly—one laborious step\nafter another—over to where Kaladin fought. It looked like he’d used his\nfinal bit of energy to hop up on Green Plate’s back and grab hold.\nGreen Plate cursed, swatting at Adolin. The prince held on, and his Plate\nhad locked, as they called it—becoming heavy and almost impossible to\nmove.\nThe two teetered, then toppled over.\nKaladin looked at Relis, who glanced from the fallen Green Plate to the\nman in orange, then to Kaladin.\nRelis turned and dashed across the sands toward Renarin.\nKaladin cursed, scrambling after him and tossing the helm aside. His\nbody felt sluggish without the Stormlight to help.\n“Renarin!” Kaladin yelled. “Yield!”\nThe boy looked up. Storms, he’d been crying. Was he hurt? He didn’t\nlook it."

He didn’t\nlook it.\n“Surrender!” Kaladin said, trying to run faster, summoning every drop\nof energy from muscles that felt drained, exhausted from being inflated by\nStormlight.\nThe lad focused on Relis, who was bearing down on him, but said\nnothing. Instead, Renarin dismissed his Blade.\nRelis skidded to a stop, raising his Blade high over his head toward the\ndefenseless prince. Renarin closed his eyes, looking upward, as if exposing\nhis throat.\nKaladin wasn’t going to arrive in time. He was too slow compared to a\nman in Plate.\nRelis hesitated, fortunately, as if unwilling to strike Renarin.\nKaladin arrived. Relis spun around and swung at him instead.\nKaladin skidded to his knees in the sand, momentum carrying him\nforward a short distance as the Blade fell. He raised his hands and snapped\nthem together.\nCatching the Blade.\nScreaming.\nWhy could he hear screaming? Inside his head? Was that Syl’s voice?\nIt reverberated through Kaladin. That horrible, awful screech shook\nhim, made his muscles tremble. He released the Shardblade with a gasp,\nfalling backward.\nRelis dropped the Blade as if bitten. He backed away, raising his hands\nto his head. “What is it? What is it! No, I didn’t kill you!” He shrieked as if\nin great pain, then ran across the sands and pulled open the door to the\npreparation room, fleeing inside. Kaladin heard his screams echoing inside\nthe hallways there long after the man vanished.\nThe arena grew still.\n“Highlord Relis Ruthar,” the judge finally called, sounding disturbed,\n“forfeits by cause of leaving the dueling arena.”\nKaladin climbed, trembling, to his feet. He glanced at Renarin—the lad\nwas fine—then slowly crossed the arena. Even the watching darkeyes had\ngrown silent. Kaladin was pretty sure they hadn’t heard that strange scream,\nthough. It had only been audible to him and Relis.\nHe stepped up to Adolin and Green Plate.\n“Stand up and fight me!” Green Plate shouted. He lay faceup on the\nground, Adolin buried beneath him and holding on in a wrestling grip.\nKaladin knelt down. Green Plate struggled more as Kaladin retrieved\nhis side knife from the sand, then pressed the tip of it into the opening in\nGreen Plate’s armor.\nThe man grew perfectly still.\n“You going to yield?” Kaladin growled. “Or do I get to kill my second\nShardbearer?”\nSilence.\n“Storms curse you both!” Green Plate finally shouted inside his helm.\n“This wasn’t a duel, this was a circus! Grappling is the way of the coward!”\nKaladin pressed the knife in farther.\n“I yield!” the man yelled, holding up his hand. “Storm you, I yield!”\n“Brightlord Jakamav yields,” the judge said. “The day goes to\nBrightlord Adolin.”\nThe darkeyes in their seats cheered. The lighteyes seemed stunned."

The lighteyes seemed stunned.\nAbove, Syl spun with the winds, and Kaladin could feel her joy. Adolin\nreleased Green Plate, who rolled off him and stomped away. Underneath,\nthe prince lay in a depression in the sand, head and shoulder exposed\nthrough broken pieces of Plate.\nHe was laughing.\nKaladin sat down beside the prince as Adolin laughed himself silly,\ntears streaming from his eyes.\n“That was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done,” Adolin said. “Oh,\nwow… Ha! I think I just won three full suits of Plate and two Blades,\nbridgeboy. Here, help me get this armor off.”\n“Your armorer can do that,” Kaladin said.\n“No time,” Adolin said, trying to sit up. “Storms. Completely drained.\nHurry, help with this. There’s something yet for me to do.”\nChallenge Sadeas, Kaladin realized. That was the point of all of this. He\nreached in under Adolin’s gauntlet, helping him undo the strap there. The\ngauntlet didn’t come off automatically, as it was supposed to. Adolin really\nhad completely drained the suit.\nThey pulled the gauntlet off, then worked on the other one. A few\nminutes later, Renarin wandered over and helped. Kaladin didn’t ask him\nabout what had happened. The lad provided some spheres, and after\nKaladin had tucked those in under Adolin’s loosened breastplate, the armor\nstarted to function again.\nThey worked to the roar of the crowd as Adolin finally got free of the\nPlate and stood up. Ahead, the king had stepped up beside the judge, one\nfoot on the railing around the arena. He looked down at Adolin, who\nnodded.\nThis is Adolin’s chance, Kaladin realized, but it can be my chance too.\nThe king raised his hands, quieting the crowd.\n“Warrior, duelmaster,” the king shouted, “I am greatly pleased by what\nyou have accomplished today. This was a fight the like of which hasn’t been\nseen in Alethkar for generations. You have pleased your king greatly.”\nCheering.\nI could do this, Kaladin thought.\n“I offer you a boon,” the king proclaimed, pointing to Adolin as the\ncheering quieted. “Name what you wish of me or of this court. It shall be\nyours. No man, having seen this display, could deny you.”\nThe Right of Challenge, Kaladin thought.\nAdolin sought out Sadeas, who had stood and was making his way up\nthe steps to flee. He understood.\nFar to the right, Amaram sat in his golden cloak.\n“For my boon,” Adolin shouted to the quiet arena, “I demand the Right\nof Challenge. I demand the chance to duel Highprince Sadeas, right here\nand now, as redress for the crimes he committed against my house!”\nSadeas stopped upon the steps. A murmur ran through the crowd. Adolin\nlooked as if he were going to say something more, but hesitated as Kaladin\nstepped up beside him.\n“And for my boon!” Kaladin shouted, “I demand the Right of Challenge"

That is the boon I demand!”\nThe king’s jaw dropped.\nThe crowd grew very, very still.\nBeside him, Adolin groaned.\nKaladin didn’t spare either one a thought. Across the distance, he met\nthe eyes of Brightlord Amaram, the murderer.\nHe saw horror therein.\nAmaram stood up, then stumbled back. He hadn’t known, hadn’t\nrecognized Kaladin, until just then.\nYou should have killed me, Kaladin thought. The crowd started to shout\nand yell.\n“Arrest him!” the king bellowed over the din.\nPerfect. Kaladin grinned.\nUntil he noticed the soldiers were coming for him and not Amaram.\n58.

They hadn’t gone to the palace. Kaladin didn’t know why.\nThe three of them were alone.\n“He insulted a highlord in front of the entire court,” Elhokar said,\npacing beside the wall. “He dared challenge a man so high above his\nstation, the gap between them could hold a kingdom.”\n“He was caught up in the moment,” Dalinar said. “Be reasonable,\nElhokar. He’d just helped bring down four Shardbearers!”\n“On a dueling ground, where his help was invited,” Elhokar said,\nthrowing his hands into the air. “I still don’t agree with letting a darkeyes\nduel Shardbearers. If you hadn’t held me back… Bah! I won’t stand for\nthis, Uncle. I won’t. Common soldiers challenging our highest and most\nimportant generals? It is madness.”\n“What I said was true,” Kaladin whispered.\n“Don’t you speak!” Elhokar shouted, stopping and leveling a finger at\nKaladin. “You’ve ruined everything! We lost our chance at Sadeas!”\n“Adolin made his challenge,” Kaladin said. “Surely Sadeas can’t ignore\nit.”\n“Of course he can’t,” Elhokar shouted. “He’s already responded!”\nKaladin frowned.\n“Adolin didn’t get a chance to pin down the duel,” Dalinar said, looking"

Kaladin felt a hollowness in his stomach. By the time a year\nhad passed, chances were the duel wouldn’t matter anymore.\n“He wiggled out of the noose,” Elhokar said, throwing up his hands.\n“We needed that moment in the arena to pin him down, to shame him into a\nfight! You stole that moment, bridgeman.”\nKaladin lowered his head. He’d have stood up to confront them, except\nfor the chains. They were cold around his ankles, locking him to the chair.\nHe remembered chains like those.\n“This is what you get, Uncle,” Elhokar said, “for putting a slave in\ncharge of our guard. Storms! What were you thinking? What was I thinking\nin allowing you?”\n“You saw him fight, Elhokar,” Dalinar said softly. “He is good.”\n“It’s not his skill but his discipline that is the problem!” The king folded\nhis arms. “Execution.”\nKaladin looked up sharply.\n“Don’t be ridiculous,” Dalinar said, stepping up beside Kaladin’s chair.\n“It is the punishment for slandering a highlord,” Elhokar said. “It is the\nlaw.”\n“You can pardon any crime, as king,” Dalinar said. “Don’t tell me you\nhonestly want to see this man hanged after what he did today.”\n“Would you stop me?” Elhokar said.\n“I wouldn’t stand for it, that’s certain.”\nElhokar crossed the room, stepping right up to Dalinar. For a moment,\nKaladin seemed forgotten.\n“Am I king?” Elhokar asked.\n“Of course you are.”\n“You don’t act like it. You’re going to have to decide something, Uncle.\nI won’t continue letting you rule, making a puppet of me.”\n“I’m not—”\n“I say the boy is to be executed. What do you say of that?”\n“I’d say that in attempting such a thing, you’d make an enemy of me,\nElhokar.” Dalinar had grown tense.\nJust try to execute me… Kaladin thought. Just try.\nThe two stared at each other for a long moment. Finally, Elhokar turned\naway. “Prison.”\n“How long?” Dalinar said.\n“Until I say he’s done!” the king said, waving a hand and stalking\ntoward the exit. He stopped there, looking at Dalinar, a challenge in his\neyes.\n“Very well,” Dalinar said.\nThe king left.\n“Hypocrite,” Kaladin hissed. “He’s the one who insisted you put me in\ncharge of his guard. Now he blames you?”\nDalinar sighed, kneeling down beside Kaladin. “What you did today\nwas a wonder. In protecting my sons, you justified my faith in you before\nthe entire court.

You knew what we were about, soldier.\nYou heard the plan in conference with us this morning. You overshadowed\nit in the name of your own petty vengeance.”\n“Amaram—”\n“I don’t know where you got this idea about Amaram,” Dalinar said,\n“but you have to stop. I checked into what you said, after you brought it to\nmy attention the first time. Seventeen witnesses told me that Amaram won\nhis Shardblade only four months ago, long after your ledger says you were\nmade a slave.”\n“Lies.”\n“Seventeen men,” Dalinar repeated. “Lighteyed and dark, along with\nthe word of a man I’ve known for decades. You’re wrong about him,\nsoldier. You’re just plain wrong.”\n“If he is so honorable,” Kaladin whispered, “then why didn’t he fight to\nsave your sons?”\nDalinar hesitated.\n“It doesn’t matter,” Kaladin said, looking away. “You’re going to let the\nking put me in prison.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, rising. “Elhokar has a temper. Once he cools down,\nI’ll get you free. For now, it might be best if you had some time to think.”\n“They’ll have a tough time forcing me to go to prison,” Kaladin said\nsoftly.\n“Have you even been listening?” Dalinar suddenly roared.\nKaladin sat back, eyes widening, as Dalinar leaned down, red-faced,\ntaking Kaladin by the shoulders as if to shake him. “Have you not felt what\nis coming? Have you not seen how this kingdom squabbles? We don’t have\ntime for this! We don’t have time for games! Stop being a child, and start\nbeing a soldier! You’ll go to prison, and you’ll go happily. That’s an order.\nDo you listen to orders anymore?”\n“I…” Kaladin found himself stammering.\nDalinar stood up, rubbing his hands on his temples. “I thought we had\nSadeas cornered, there. I thought maybe we’d be able to cut his feet out\nfrom under him and save this kingdom.

If that challenge had\nbeen sustained, Sadeas would quickly have found himself in the arena with\na man who had just defeated not one, but four Shardbearers.\nHe sat down. He did not look for wine. Wine made a man forget, and he\ndidn’t want to forget this. He must never forget this.\nHow satisfying it would be to someday ram Dalinar’s own sword into\nhis chest. Storms. To think he’d almost felt pity for his former friend. Now\nthe man pulled something like this. How had he grown so deft?\nNo, Sadeas told himself. This was not deftness. It was luck. Pure and\nsimple luck.\nFour Shardbearers. How? Even allowing for the help of that slave, it\nwas now obvious that Adolin was at last growing into the man his father\nhad once been. That terrified Sadeas, because the man Dalinar had once\nbeen—the Blackthorn—had been a large part of what had conquered this\nkingdom.\nIsn’t this what you wanted? Sadeas thought. To reawaken him?\nNo. The deeper truth was that Sadeas didn’t want Dalinar back. He\nwanted his old friend out of the way, and it had been such for months now,\nno matter what he wanted to tell himself.\nA while later, the door to his study opened and Ialai slipped in. Seeing\nhim lost in thought, she stopped by the door.\n“Organize all of your informants,” Sadeas said, looking up at the\nceiling. “Every spy you have, every source you know. Find me something,\nIalai. Something to hurt him.”\nShe nodded.\n“And after that,” Sadeas said, “it will be time to make use of those\nassassins you’ve planted.”\nHe had to ensure that Dalinar was desperate and wounded—had to\nguarantee that the others viewed him as broken, ruined.\nThen he’d end this.\n* * *\nSoldiers arrived for Kaladin a short time later.

Stay strong, the fist said.\nKaladin bowed his head and shuffled with them, led through camp\nbefore the watching eyes of soldiers and scribes alike. He caught a glimpse\nof Bridge Four uniforms in the crowd.\nHe reached Dalinar’s camp prison, where soldiers did time for fighting\nor other offenses. It was a small, nearly windowless building with thick\nwalls.\nInside, in an isolated section, Kaladin was placed in a cell with stone\nwalls and a door of steel bars. They left the chains on as they locked him in.\nHe sat down on a stone bench, waiting, until Syl finally drifted into the\nroom.\n“This,” Kaladin said, looking at her, “is what comes of trusting\nlighteyes. Never again, Syl.”\n“Kaladin…”\nHe closed his eyes, turning and lying down on the cold stone bench.\nHe was in a cage once again.\nTHE END OF\nPart Three\nInterludes\nI-9.

Not because she might get caught, but because once you robbed a\nstarvin’ palace, where did you go next?\nShe climbed up onto the outer wall and looked in at the grounds.\nEverything inside—trees, rocks, buildings—reflected the starlight in an odd\nway. A bulbous-looking building stuck up in the middle of it all, like a\nbubble on a pond. In fact, most of the buildings were that same round\nshape, often with small protrusions sprouting out of the top. There wasn’t a\nstraight line in the whole starvin’ place. Just lots and lots of curves.\nLift’s companions climbed up to peek over the top of the wall. A\nscuffling, scrambling, rowdy mess they were. Six men, supposedly master\nthieves. They couldn’t even climb a wall properly.\n“The Bronze Palace itself,” Huqin breathed.\n“Bronze? Is that what everythin’ is made of?” Lift asked, sitting on the\nwall with one leg over the side. “Looks like a bunch of breasts.”\nThe men looked at her, aghast. They were all Azish, with dark skin and\nhair. She was Reshi, from the islands up north. Her mother had told her that,\nthough Lift had never seen the place.\n“What?” Huqin demanded.\n“Breasts,” Lift said, pointing. “See, like a lady layin’ on her back. Those\npoints on the tops are nipples. Bloke who built this place musta been single\nfor a looong time.”\nHuqin turned to one of his companions. Using their ropes, they scuttled\nback down the outside of the wall to hold a whispered conference.\n“Grounds at this end look empty, as my informant indicated would be\nthe case,” Huqin said. He was in charge of the lot of them. Had a nose like\nsomeone had taken hold of it when he was a kid and pulled real, real hard.\nLift was surprised he didn’t smack people in the face with it when he\nturned.\n“Everyone’s focused on choosing the new Prime Aqasix,” said Maxin.\n“We could really do this. Rob the Bronze Palace itself, and right under the\nnose of the vizierate.”\n“Is it… um… safe?” asked Huqin’s nephew. He was in his teens, and\npuberty hadn’t been kind to him. Not with that face, that voice, and those\nspindly legs.\n“Hush,” Huqin snapped.\n“No,” Tigzikk said, “the boy is right to express caution. This will be\nvery dangerous.”\nTigzikk was considered the learned one in the group on account of his\nbeing able to cuss in three languages. Downright scholarly, that was. He\nwore fancy clothing, while most of the others wore black. “There will be\nchaos,” Tigzikk continued, “because so many people move through the\npalace tonight, but there will also be danger.

Many, many bodyguards and a\nlikelihood of suspicion on all sides.”\nTigzikk was an aging fellow, and was the only one of the group Lift\nknew well. She couldn’t say his name. That “quq” sound on the end of his\nname sounded like choking when someone pronounced it correctly. She just\ncalled him Tig instead.\n“Tigzikk,” Huqin said. Yup. Choking. “You were the one who suggested\nthis. Don’t tell me you’re getting cold now.”\n“I’m not backing down. I’m pleading caution.”\nLift leaned down over the wall toward them. “Less arguing,” she said.\n“Let’s move. I’m hungry.”\nHuqin looked up. “Why did we bring her along?”\n“She’ll be useful,” Tigzikk said. “You’ll see.”\n“She’s just a child!”\n“She’s a youth. She’s at least twelve.”\n“I ain’t twelve,” Lift snapped, looming over them.\nThey turned up toward her.\n“I ain’t,” she said. “Twelve’s an unlucky number.” She held up her\nhands. “I’m only this many.”\n“… Ten?” Tigzikk asked.\n“Is that how many that is? Sure, then. Ten.” She lowered her hands. “If I\ncan’t count it on my fingers, it’s unlucky.” And she’d been that many for\nthree years now. So there.\n“Seems like there are a lot of unlucky ages,” Huqin said, sounding\namused.\n“Sure are,” she agreed. She scanned the grounds again, then glanced\nback the way they had come, into the city.\nA man walked down one of the streets leading to the palace. His dark\nclothing blended into the gloom, but his silver buttons glinted each time he\npassed a streetlight.\nStorms, she thought, a chill running up her spine. I didn’t lose him after\nall.\nShe looked down at the men. “Are you coming with me or not? ’Cuz\nI’m leaving.” She slipped over the top and dropped into the palace yards.\nLift squatted there, feeling the cold ground. Yup, it was metal. Everything\nwas bronze. Rich people, she decided, loved to stick with a theme.\nAs the boys finally stopped arguing and started climbing, a thin,\ntwisting trail of vines grew out of the darkness and approached Lift. It\nlooked like a little stream of spilled water picking its way across the floor.\nHere and there, bits of clear crystal peeked out of the vines, like sections of\nquartz in otherwise dark stone. Those weren’t sharp, but smooth like\npolished glass, and didn’t glow with Stormlight.\nThe vines grew super-fast, curling about one another in a tangle that\nformed a face.\n“Mistress,” the face said. “Is this wise?”\n“’Ello, Voidbringer,” Lift said, scanning the grounds.\n“I am not a Voidbringer!” he said. “And you know it. Just… just stop\nsaying that!”\nLift grinned. “You’re my pet Voidbringer, and no lies are going to\nchange that. I got you captured. No stealing souls, now. We ain’t here for\nsouls. Just a little thievery, the type what never hurt nobody.”"

Just a little thievery, the type what never hurt nobody.”\nThe vine face—he called himself Wyndle—sighed. Lift scuttled across\nthe bronze ground over to a tree that was, of course, also made of bronze.\nHuqin had chosen the darkest part of night, between moons, for them to slip\nin—but the starlight was enough to see by on a cloudless night like this.\nWyndle grew up to her, leaving a small trail of vines that people didn’t\nseem to be able to see. The vines hardened after a few moments of sitting,\nas if briefly becoming solid crystal, then they crumbled to dust. People\nspotted that on occasion, though they certainly couldn’t see Wyndle\nhimself.\n“I’m a spren,” Wyndle said to her. “Part of a proud and noble—”\n“Hush,” Lift said, peeking out from behind the bronze tree. An open-\ntopped carriage passed on the drive beyond, carrying some important Azish\nfolk. You could tell by the coats. Big, drooping coats with really wide\nsleeves and patterns that argued with each other. They all looked like kids\nwho had snuck into their parents’ wardrobe. The hats were nifty, though.\nThe thieves followed behind her, moving with reasonable stealth. They\nreally weren’t that bad. Even if they didn’t know how to climb a wall\nproperly.\nThey gathered around her, and Tigzikk stood up, straightening his coat\n—which was an imitation of one of those worn by the rich scribe types who\nworked in the government. Here in Azir, working for the government was\nreal important. Everyone else was said to be “discrete,” whatever that\nmeant.\n“Ready?” Tigzikk said to Maxin, who was the other one of the thieves\ndressed in fine clothing.\nMaxin nodded, and the two of them moved off to the right, heading\ntoward the palace’s sculpture garden. The important people would\nsupposedly be shuffling around in there, speculating about who should be\nthe next Prime.\nDangerous job, that. The last two had gotten their heads chopped off by\nsome bloke in white with a Shardblade. The most recent Prime hadn’t lasted\ntwo starvin’ days!\nWith Tigzikk and Maxin gone, Lift only had four others to worry about.\nHuqin, his nephew, and two slender brothers who didn’t talk much and kept\nreaching under their coats for knives. Lift didn’t like their type. Thieving\nshouldn’t leave bodies. Leaving bodies was easy. There was no challenge to\nit if you could just kill anyone who spotted you.\n“You can get us in,” Huqin said to Lift. “Right?”\nLift pointedly rolled her eyes. Then she scuttled across the bronze\ngrounds toward the main palace structure.\nReally does look like a breast…\nWyndle curled along the ground beside her, his vine trail sprouting tiny\nbits of clear crystal here and there.

Voidbringers were a\nstrange lot.\n“You realize that I didn’t choose you,” he said, a face appearing in the\nvines as they moved. His speaking left a strange effect, the trail behind him\nclotted with a sequence of frozen faces. The mouth seemed to move\nbecause it was growing so quickly beside her. “I wanted to pick a\ndistinguished Iriali matron. A grandmother, an accomplished gardener. But\nno, the Ring said we should choose you. ‘She has visited the Old Magic,’\nthey said. ‘Our mother has blessed her,’ they said. ‘She will be young, and\nwe can mold her,’ they said. Well, they don’t have to put up with—”\n“Shut it, Voidbringer,” Lift hissed, drawing up beside the wall of the\npalace. “Or I’ll bathe in blessed water and go listen to the priests. Maybe\nget an exorcism.”\nLift edged sideways until she could look around the curve of the wall to\nspot the guard patrol: men in patterned vests and caps, with long halberds.\nShe looked up the side of the wall. It bulged out just above her, like a\nrockbud, before tapering up further. It was of smooth bronze, with no\nhandholds.\nShe waited until the guards had walked farther away. “All right,” she\nwhispered to Wyndle. “You gotta do what I say.”\n“I do not.”\n“Sure you do. I captured you, just like in the stories.”\n“I came to you,” Wyndle said. “Your powers come from me! Do you\neven listen to—”\n“Up the wall,” Lift said, pointing.\nWyndle sighed, but obeyed, creeping up the wall in a wide, looping\npattern. Lift hopped up, grabbing the small handholds made by the vine,\nwhich stuck to the surface by virtue of thousands of branching stems with\nsticky discs on them. Wyndle wove ahead of her, making a ladder of sorts.\nIt wasn’t easy. It was starvin’ difficult, with that bulge, and Wyndle’s\nhandholds weren’t very big. But she did it, climbing all the way to the near-\ntop of the building’s dome, where windows peeked out at the grounds.\nShe glanced toward the city. No sign of the man in the black uniform.\nMaybe she’d lost him.\nShe turned back to examine the window. Its nice wooden frame held\nvery thick glass, even though it pointed east. It was unfair how well Azimir\nwas protected from highstorms. They should have to live with the wind, like\nnormal folk.\n“We need to Voidbring that,” she said, pointing at the window.\n“Have you realized,” Wyndle said, “that while you claim to be a master\nthief, I do all of the work in this relationship?”\n“You do all the complainin’ too,” she said. “How do we get through\nthis?”\n“You have the seeds?”\nShe nodded, fishing in her pocket. Then in the other one. Then in her\nback pocket. Ah, there they were. She pulled out a handful of seeds.\n“I can’t affect the Physical Realm except in minor ways,” Wyndle said.\n“This means that you will need to use Investiture to—”\nLift yawned."

Starvin’ Voidbringers never could catch a hint.\nWyndle sighed. “Spread the seeds on the frame.”\nShe did so, throwing the handful of seeds at the window.\n“Your bond to me grants two primary classes of ability,” Wyndle said.\n“The first, manipulation of friction, you’ve already—don’t yawn at me!—\ndiscovered. We have been using that well for many weeks now, and it is\ntime for you to learn the second, the power of Growth. You aren’t ready for\nwhat was once known as Regrowth, the healing of—”\nLift pressed her hand against the seeds, then summoned her\nawesomeness.\nShe wasn’t sure how she did it. She just did. It had started right around\nwhen Wyndle had first appeared.\nHe hadn’t talked then. She kind of missed those days.\nHer hand glowed faintly with white light, like vapor coming off the\nskin. The seeds that saw the light started to grow. Fast. Vines burst from the\nseeds and wormed into the cracks between the window and its frame.\nThe vines grew at her will, making constricted, straining sounds. The\nglass cracked, then the window frame popped open.\nLift grinned.\n“Well done,” Wyndle said. “We’ll make an Edgedancer out of you yet.”\nHer stomach grumbled. When had she last eaten? She’d used a lot of her\nawesomeness practicing earlier. She probably should have stolen something\nto eat. She wasn’t quite so awesome when she was hungry.\nShe slipped inside the window. Having a Voidbringer was useful,\nthough she wasn’t completely sure her powers came from him. That seemed\nthe sorta thing a Voidbringer would lie about. She had captured him, fair\nand square. She’d used words. A Voidbringer had no body, not really. To\ncatch something like that, you had to use words. Everybody knew it. Just\nlike curses made evil things come find you.\nShe had to get out a sphere—a diamond mark, her lucky one—to see\nproperly in here. The small bedroom was decorated after the Azish way\nwith lots of intricate patterns on the rugs and the fabric on the walls, mostly\ngold and red here. Those patterns were everything to the Azish. They were\nlike words.\nShe looked out the window. Surely she’d escaped Darkness, the man in\nthe black and silver with the pale crescent birthmark on his cheek. The man\nwith the dead, lifeless stare. Surely he hadn’t followed her all the way from\nMarabethia. That was half a continent away! Well, a quarter one, at the\nleast.\nConvinced, she uncoiled the rope that she wore wrapped around her\nwaist and over her shoulders. She tied it to the door of a built-in closet, then\nfed it out the window. It tightened as the men started climbing. Nearby,\nWyndle grew up around one of the bedposts, coiled like a skyeel.\nShe heard whispered voices below. “Did you see that? She climbed\nright up it. Not a handhold in sight. How… ?”"

How… ?”\n“Hush.” That was Huqin.\nLift began poking through cabinets and drawers as the boys clambered\nin the window one at a time. Once inside, the thieves pulled up the rope and\nshut the window as best they could. Huqin studied the vines she’d grown\nfrom seeds on the frame.\nLift stuck her head in the bottom of a wardrobe, groping around. “Ain’t\nnothing in this room but moldy shoes.”\n“You,” Huqin said to her, “and my nephew will hold this room. The\nthree of us will search the bedrooms nearby. We will be back shortly.”\n“You’ll probably have a whole sack of moldy shoes…” Lift said,\npulling out of the wardrobe.\n“Ignorant child,” Huqin said, pointing at the wardrobe. One of his men\ngrabbed the shoes and outfits inside, stuffing them in a sack. “This clothing\nwill sell for bundles. It’s exactly what we’re looking for.”\n“What about real riches?” Lift said. “Spheres, jewelry, art…” She had\nlittle interest in those things herself, but she’d figured it was what Huqin\nwas after.\n“That will all be far too well guarded,” Huqin said as his two associates\nmade quick work of the room’s clothing. “The difference between a\nsuccessful thief and a dead thief is knowing when to escape with your\ntakings. This haul will let us live in luxury for a year or two. That is\nenough.”\nOne of the brothers peeked out the door into the hallway. He nodded,\nand the three of them slipped out. “Listen for the warning,” Huqin said to\nhis nephew, then eased the door almost closed behind him.\nTigzikk and his accomplice below would listen for any kind of alarm. If\nanything seemed to be amiss, they’d slip off and blow their whistles.\nHuqin’s nephew crouched by the window to listen, obviously taking his\nduty very seriously. He looked to be about sixteen. Unlucky age, that.\n“How did you climb the wall like that?” the youth asked.\n“Gumption,” Lift said. “And spit.”\nHe frowned at her.\n“I gots magic spit.”\nHe seemed to believe her. Idiot.\n“Is it strange for you here?” he asked. “Away from your people?”\nShe stood out. Straight black hair—she wore it down to her waist—tan\nskin, rounded features. Everyone would immediately mark her as Reshi.\n“Don’t know,” Lift said, strolling to the door. “Ain’t never been around\nmy people.”\n“You’re not from the islands?”\n“Nope. Grew up in Rall Elorim.”\n“The… City of Shadows?”\n“Yup.”\n“Is it—”\n“Yup. Just like they say.”\nShe peeked through the door. Huqin and the others were well out of the\nway. The hallway was bronze—walls and everything—but a red and blue\nrug, with lots of little vine patterns, ran down the center. Paintings hung on\nthe walls.\nShe pulled the door all the way open and stepped out."

Paintings hung on\nthe walls.\nShe pulled the door all the way open and stepped out.\n“Lift!” The nephew scrambled to the door. “They told us to wait here!”\n“And?”\n“And we should wait here! We don’t want to get Uncle Huqin in\ntrouble!”\n“What’s the point of sneaking into a palace if not to get into trouble?”\nShe shook her head. Odd men, these. “This should be an interesting place,\nwhat with all of the rich folk hanging around.” There ought to be some\nreally good food in here.\nShe padded out into the hallway, and Wyndle grew along the floor\nbeside her. Interestingly, the nephew followed. She’d expected him to stay\nin the room.\n“We shouldn’t be doing this,” he said as they passed a door that was\nopen a crack, shuffles sounding from inside. Huqin and his men, robbing\nthe place silly.\n“Then stay,” Lift whispered, reaching a large stairwell. Servants\nwhisked back and forth below, even a few parshmen, but she didn’t catch\nsight of anyone in one of those coats. “Where are the important folk?”\n“Reading forms,” the nephew said from beside her.\n“Forms?”\n“Sure,” he said. “With the Prime dead, the viziers, scribes, and arbiters\nwere all given a chance to fill out the proper paperwork to apply to take his\nplace.”\n“You apply to be emperor?” Lift said.\n“Sure,” he said. “Lots of paperwork involved in that. And an essay. Your\nessay has to be really good to get this job.”\n“Storms. You people are crazy.”\n“Other nations do it better? With bloody succession wars? This way,\neveryone has a chance. Even the lowest of clerks can submit the paperwork.\nYou can even be discrete and end up on the throne, if you are convincing\nenough. It happened once.”\n“Crazy.”\n“Says the girl who talks to herself.”\nLift looked at him sharply.\n“Don’t pretend you don’t,” he said. “I’ve seen you doing it. Talking to\nthe air, as if somebody were there.”\n“What’s your name?” she asked.\n“Gawx.”\n“Wow. Well then, Gaw. I don’t talk to myself because I’m crazy.”\n“No?”\n“I do it because I’m awesome.” She started down the steps, waited for a\ngap between passing servants, then made for a closet across the way. Gawx\ncursed, then followed.\nLift was tempted to use her awesomeness to slide across the floor\nquickly, but she didn’t need that yet. Besides, Wyndle kept complaining that\nshe used the awesomeness too often. That she was at risk of malnutrition,\nwhatever that meant.\nShe slipped up to the closet, using just her normal everyday sneakin’\nskills, and moved inside. Gawx scrambled into the closet with her just\nbefore she pulled it shut. Dinnerware on a serving cart clinked behind them,\nand they could barely crowd into the space. Gawx moved, causing more\nclinks, and she elbowed him. He stilled as two parshmen passed, bearing\nlarge wine barrels."

He stilled as two parshmen passed, bearing\nlarge wine barrels.\n“You should go back upstairs,” Lift whispered to him. “This could be\ndangerous.”\n“Oh, sneaking into the storming royal palace is dangerous? Thanks. I\nhadn’t realized.”\n“I mean it,” Lift said, peeking out of the closet. “Go back up, leave\nwhen Huqin returns. He’ll abandon me in a heartbeat. Probably will you,\ntoo.”\nBesides, she didn’t want to be awesome with Gawx around. That started\nquestions. And rumors. She hated both. For once, she’d like to be able to\nstay someplace for a while without being forced to run off.\n“No,” Gawx said softly. “If you’re going to steal something good, I\nwant a piece of it. Then maybe Huqin will stop making me stay behind,\ngiving me the easy jobs.”\nHuh. So he had some spunk to him.\nA servant passed carrying a large, plate-filled tray. The food smells\nwafting from it made Lift’s stomach growl. Rich-person food. So delicious.\nLift watched the woman go, then broke out of the closet, following\nafter. This was going to get difficult with Gawx in tow. He’d been trained\nwell enough by his uncle, but moving unseen through a populated building\nwasn’t easy.\nThe serving woman pulled open a door that was hidden in the wall.\nServants’ hallways. Lift caught it as it closed, waited a few heartbeats, then\neased it open and slipped through. The narrow hallway was poorly lit and\nsmelled of the food that had just passed.\nGawx entered behind Lift, then silently pulled the door closed. The\nserving woman disappeared around a corner ahead—there were probably\nlots of hallways like this in the palace. Behind Lift, Wyndle grew around\nthe doorframe, a dark green, funguslike creep of vines that covered the\ndoor, then the wall beside her.\nHe formed a face in the vines and spots of crystal, then shook his head.\n“Too narrow?” Lift asked.\nHe nodded.\n“It’s dark in here. Hard to see us.”\n“Vibrations on the floor, mistress. Someone coming this direction.”\nShe looked longingly after the servant with the food, then shoved past\nGawx and pushed open the door, entering the main hallways again.\nGawx cursed. “Do you even know what you’re doing?”\n“No,” she said, then scuttled around a corner into a large hallway lined\nwith alternating green and yellow gemstone lamps. Unfortunately, a servant\nin a stiff, black and white uniform was coming right at her.\nGawx let out a “meep” of worry, ducking back around the corner. Lift\nstood up straight, clasped her hands behind her back, and strolled forward.\nShe passed the man. His uniform marked him as someone important, for\na servant.\n“You, there!” the man snapped. “What is this?”\n“Mistress wants some cake,” Lift said, jutting out her chin.\n“Oh, for Yaezir’s sake. Food is served in the gardens! There is cake\nthere!”"

There is cake\nthere!”\n“Wrong type,” Lift said. “Mistress wants berry cake.”\nThe man threw his hands into the air. “Kitchens are back the other way,”\nhe said. “Try and persuade the cook, though she’ll probably chop your\nhands off before she takes another special request. Storming country\nscribes! Special dietary needs are supposed to be sent ahead of time, with\nthe proper forms!” He stalked off, leaving Lift with hands behind her back,\nwatching him.\nGawx slunk around the corner. “I thought we were dead for sure.”\n“Don’t be stupid,” Lift said, hurrying down the hallway. “This ain’t the\ndangerous part yet.”\nAt the other end, this hallway intersected another one—with the same\nwide rug down the center, bronze walls, and glowing metal lamps. Across\nthe way was a door with no light shining under it. Lift checked in both\ndirections, then dashed to the door, cracked it, peeked in, then waved for\nGawx to join her inside.\n“We should go right down that hallway outside,” Gawx whispered as\nshe shut the door all but a crack. “Down that way, we’ll find the vizier\nquarters. They’re probably empty, because everyone will be in the Prime’s\nwing deliberating.”\n“You know the palace layout?” she asked, crouching in near darkness\nbeside the door. They were in a small sitting room of some sort, with a\ncouple of shadowed chairs and a small table.\n“Yeah,” Gawx said. “I memorized the palace maps before we came. You\ndidn’t?”\nShe shrugged.\n“I’ve been in here once before,” Gawx said. “I watched the Prime\nsleeping.”\n“You what?”\n“He’s public,” Gawx said, “belongs to everyone. You can enter a lottery\nto come look at him sleeping. They rotate people through every hour.”\n“What? On a special day or something?”\n“No, every day. You can watch him eat too, or watch him perform his\ndaily rituals. If he loses a hair or cuts off a nail, you might be able to keep it\nas a relic.”\n“Sounds creepy.”\n“A little.”\n“Which way to his rooms?” Lift asked.\n“That way,” Gawx said, pointing left down the hallway outside—the\nopposite direction from the vizier chambers. “You don’t want to go there,\nLift. That’s where the viziers and everyone important will be reviewing\napplications. In the Prime’s presence.”\n“But he’s dead.”\n“The new Prime.”\n“He ain’t been chosen yet!”\n“Well, it’s kind of strange,” Gawx said. By the dim light of the cracked\ndoor, she could see him blushing, as if he knew how starvin’ odd this all\nwas. “There’s never not a Prime. We just don’t know who he is yet. I mean,\nhe’s alive, and he’s already Prime—right now. We’re just catching up. So,\nthose are his quarters, and the scions and viziers want to be in his presence\nwhile they decide who he is. Even if the person they decide upon isn’t in the\nroom.”\n“That makes no sense.”"

This is all\nvery well detailed in the codes and…” He trailed off as Lift yawned. Azish\ncould be real boring. At least he could take a hint, though.\n“Anyway,” Gawx continued, “everyone outside in the gardens is hoping\nto be called in for a personal interview. It might not come to that, though.\nThe scions can’t be Prime, as they’re too busy visiting and blessing villages\naround the kingdom—but a vizier can, and they tend to have the best\napplications. Usually, one of their number is chosen.”\n“The Prime’s quarters,” Lift said. “That’s the direction the food went.”\n“What is it with you and food?”\n“I’m going to eat their dinner,” she said, soft but intense.\nGawx blinked, startled. “You’re… what?”\n“I’m gonna eat their food,” she said. “Rich folk have the best food.”\n“But… there might be spheres in the vizier quarters…”\n“Eh,” she said. “I’d just spend ’em on food.”\nStealing regular stuff was no fun. She wanted a real challenge. Over the\nlast two years, she’d picked the most difficult places to enter. Then she’d\nsnuck in.\nAnd eaten their dinners.\n“Come on,” she said, moving out of the doorway, then turned left\ntoward the Prime’s chambers.\n“You really are crazy,” Gawx whispered.\n“Nah. Just bored.”\nHe looked the other way. “I’m going for the vizier quarters.”\n“Suit yourself,” she said. “I’d go back upstairs instead, if I were you.\nYou aren’t practiced enough for this kind of thing. You leave me, you’re\nprobably going to get into trouble.”\nHe fidgeted, then slipped off in the direction of the vizier quarters. Lift\nrolled her eyes.\n“Why did you even come with them?” Wyndle asked, creeping out of\nthe room. “Why not just sneak in on your own?”\n“Tigzikk found out about this whole election thing,” she said. “He told\nme tonight was a good night for sneaking. I owed it to him. Besides, I\nwanted to be here in case he got into trouble. I might need to help.”\n“Why bother?”\nWhy indeed? “Someone has to care,” she said, starting down the\nhallway. “Too few people care, these days.”\n“You say this while coming in to rob people.”\n“Sure. Ain’t gonna hurt them.”\n“You have an odd sense of morality, mistress.”\n“Don’t be stupid,” she said. “Every sense of morality is odd.”\n“I suppose.”\n“Particularly to a Voidbringer.”\n“I’m not—”\nShe grinned and hurried her pace toward the Prime’s quarters. She knew\nshe’d found those when she glanced down a side hallway and spotted\nguards at the end. Yup. That door was so nice, it had to belong to an\nemperor. Only super-rich folk built fancy doors.

You needed money coming\nout your ears before you spent it on a door.\nGuards were a problem. Lift knelt down, peeking around the corner. The\nhallway leading to the emperor’s rooms was narrow, like an alleyway.\nSmart. Hard to sneak down something like that. And those two guards, they\nweren’t the bored type. They were the “we gotta stand here and look real\nangry” type. They stood so straight, you’d have thought someone had\nshoved brooms up their backsides.\nShe glanced upward. The hallway was tall; rich folk liked tall stuff. If\nthey’d been poor, they’d have built another floor up there for their aunts and\ncousins to live in. Rich people wasted space instead. Proved they had so\nmuch money, they could waste it.\nSeemed perfectly rational to steal from them.\n“There,” Lift whispered, pointing to a small ornamented ledge that ran\nalong the wall up above. It wouldn’t be wide enough to walk on, unless you\nwere Lift. Which, fortunately, she was. It was dim up there too. The\nchandeliers were the dangly kind, and they hung low, with mirrors\nreflecting their spherelight downward.\n“Up we go,” she said.\nWyndle sighed.\n“You gotta do what I say or I’ll prune you.”\n“You’ll… prune me.”\n“Sure.” That sounded threatening, right?\nWyndle grew up the wall, giving her handholds. Already, the vines he’d\ntrailed through the hallway behind them were vanishing, becoming crystal\nand disintegrating into dust.\n“Why don’t they notice you?” Lift whispered. She’d never asked him,\ndespite their months together. “Is it ’cuz only the pure in heart can see\nyou?”\n“You’re not serious.”\n“Sure. That’d fit into legends and stories and stuff.”\n“Oh, the theory itself isn’t ridiculous,” Wyndle said, speaking out of a\nbit of vine near her, the various cords of green moving like lips. “Merely the\nidea that you consider yourself to be pure in heart.”\n“I’m pure,” Lift whispered, grunting as she climbed. “I’m a child and\nstuff. I’m so storming pure I practically belch rainbows.”\nWyndle sighed again—he liked to do that—as they reached the ledge.\nWyndle grew along the side of it, making it slightly wider, and Lift stepped\nonto it. She balanced carefully, then nodded to Wyndle. He grew further\nalong the ledge, then doubled back and grew up the wall to a point above\nher head. From there, he grew horizontally to give her a handhold. With the\nextra inch of vine on the ledge and the handhold above, she managed to\nsidle along, stomach to the wall. She took a deep breath, then turned the\ncorner into the hallway with the guards.\nShe moved along it slowly, Wyndle wrapping back and forth, enhancing\nboth footing and handholds for her. The guards didn’t cry out. She was\ndoing it.\n“They can’t see me,” Wyndle said, growing up beside her to create\nanother line of handholds, “because I exist mostly in the Cognitive Realm,"

Of\ncourse, no matter how I manifest, nobody can touch me, as I barely have\nany substance in this Realm.”\n“Nobody but me,” Lift whispered, inching down the hallway.\n“You shouldn’t be able to either,” he said, sounding troubled. “What did\nyou ask for, when you visited my mother?”\nLift didn’t have to answer that, not to a storming Voidbringer. She\neventually reached the end of the hallway. Beneath her was the door.\nUnfortunately, that was exactly where the guards stood.\n“This does not seem very well thought out, mistress,” Wyndle noted.\n“Had you considered what you were going to do once you got here?”\nShe nodded.\n“Well?”\n“Wait,” she whispered.\nThey did, Lift with her front pressed to the wall, her heels hanging out\nabove a fifteen-foot drop onto the guards. She didn’t want to fall. She was\npretty sure she was awesome enough to survive it, but if they saw her, that\nwould end the game. She’d have to run, and she’d never get any dinner.\nFortunately, she’d guessed right, unfortunately. A guard appeared at the\nother end of the hallway, looking out of breath and not a little annoyed. The\nother two guards jogged over to him. He turned, pointing the other way.\nThat was her chance. Wyndle grew a vine downward, and Lift grabbed\nit. She could feel the crystals jutting out between the tendrils, but they were\nsmooth and faceted—not angular and sharp. She dropped, vine smooth\nbetween her fingers, pulling herself to a stop just before the floor.\nShe only had a few seconds.\n“… caught a thief trying to ransack the vizier quarters,” said the newer\nguard. “Might be more. Keep watch. By Yaezir himself! I can’t believe\nthey’d dare. Tonight of all nights!”\nLift cracked open the door to the emperor’s rooms and peeked in. Big\nroom. Men and women at a table. Nobody looking her direction. She\nslipped through the door.\nThen became awesome.\nShe ducked down, kicked herself forward, and for a moment, the floor\n—the carpet, the wood beneath—had no purchase on her. She glided as if\non ice, making no noise as she slid across the ten-foot gap. Nothing could\nhold her when she got Slick like this. Fingers would slip off her, and she\ncould glide forever. She didn’t think she’d ever stop unless she turned off\nthe awesomeness. She’d slide all the way to the storming ocean itself.\nTonight, she stopped herself under the table, using her fingers—which\nweren’t Slick—then removed the Slickness from her legs. Her stomach\ngrowled in complaint. She needed food. Real fast, or no more awesomeness\nfor her.\n“Somehow, you are partly in the Cognitive Realm,” Wyndle said,"

Real fast, or no more awesomeness\nfor her.\n“Somehow, you are partly in the Cognitive Realm,” Wyndle said,\ncoiling beside her and raising a twisting mesh of vines that could make a\nface. “It is the only answer I can find to why you can touch spren. And you\ncan metabolize food directly into Stormlight.”\nShe shrugged. He was always saying words like those. Trying to\nconfuse her, starvin’ Voidbringer. Well, she wouldn’t talk back to him, not\nnow. The men and women standing around the table might hear her, even if\nthey couldn’t hear Wyndle.\nThat food was in here somewhere. She could smell it.\n“But why?” Wyndle said. “Why did She give you this incredible talent?\nWhy a child? There are soldiers, grand kings, incredible scholars among\nhumankind. Instead she chose you.”\nFood, food, food. Smelled great. Lift crawled along under the long\ntable. The men and women up above were talking in very concerned voices.\n“Your application was clearly the best, Dalksi.”\n“What! I misspelled three words in the first paragraph alone!”\n“I didn’t notice.”\n“You didn’t… Of course you noticed! But this is pointless, because\nAxikk’s essay was obviously superior to mine.”\n“Don’t bring me into this again. We disqualified me. I’m not fit to be\nPrime. I have a bad back.”\n“Ashno of Sages had a bad back. He was one of the greatest Emuli\nPrimes.”\n“Bah! My essay was utter rubbish, and you know it.”\nWyndle moved along beside Lift. “Mother has given up on your kind. I\ncan feel it. She doesn’t care any longer. Now that He’s gone…”\n“This arguing does not befit us,” said a commanding female voice. “We\nshould take our vote. People are waiting.”\n“Let it go to one of those fools in the gardens.”\n“Their essays were dreadful. Just look at what Pandri wrote across the\ntop of hers.”\n“My… I… I don’t know what half of that even means, but it does seem\ninsulting.”\nThis finally caught Lift’s attention. She looked up toward the table\nabove. Good cusses? Come on, she thought. Read a few of those.\n“We’ll have to pick one of them,” the other voice—she sounded very in\ncharge—said. “Kadasixes and Stars, this is a puzzle. What do we do when\nnobody wants to be Prime?”\nNobody wanted to be Prime? Had the entire country suddenly grown\nsome sense? Lift continued on. Being rich seemed fun and all, but being in\ncharge of that many people? Pure misery, that would be.\n“Perhaps we should pick the worst application,” one of the voices said.\n“In this situation, that would indicate the cleverest applicant.”\n“Six different monarchs killed…” one of the voices said, a new one. “In\na mere two months. Highprinces slaughtered throughout the East. Religious\nleaders. And then, two Primes murdered in a matter of a single week.\nStorms… I almost think it’s another Desolation come upon us.”\n“A Desolation in the form of a single man. Yaezir help the one we\nchoose. It is a death sentence.”"

It is a death sentence.”\n“We have stalled too long as it is. These weeks of waiting with no Prime\nhave been harmful to Azir. Let’s just pick the worst application. From this\nstack.”\n“What if we pick someone who is legitimately terrible? Is it not our duty\nto care for the kingdom, regardless of the risk to the one we choose?”\n“But in picking the best from among us, we doom our brightest, our\nbest, to die by the sword… Yaezir help us. Scion Ethid, a prayer for\nguidance would be appreciated. We need Yaezir himself to show us his will.\nPerhaps if we choose the right person, he or she will be protected by his\nhand.”\nLift reached the end of the table and looked out at a banquet that had\nbeen set onto a smaller table at the other side of the room. This place was\nvery Azish. Curls of embroidery everywhere. Carpets so fine, they probably\ndrove some poor woman blind weaving them. Dark colors and dim lights.\nPaintings on the walls.\nHuh, Lift thought, someone scratched a face off of that one. Who’d ruin\na painting like that, and such a fine one, the Heralds all in a row?\nWell, nobody seemed to be touching that feast. Her stomach growled,\nbut she waited for a distraction.\nIt came soon after. The door opened. Likely the guards coming to report\nabout the thief they’d found. Poor Gawx. She’d have to go break him out\nlater.\nRight now, it was time for food. Lift shoved herself forward on her\nknees and used her awesomeness to Slick her legs. She slid across the floor\nand grabbed the corner leg of the food table. Her momentum smoothly\npivoted her around and behind it. She crouched down, the tablecloth neatly\nhiding her from the people at the room’s center, and unSlicked her legs.\nPerfect. She reached up a hand and plucked a dinner roll off the table.\nShe took a bite, then hesitated.\nWhy had everyone grown quiet? She risked a glance over the tabletop.\nHe had arrived.\nThe tall Azish man with the white mark on his cheek, like a crescent.\nBlack uniform with a double row of silver buttons down the coat’s front, a\nstiff silver collar poking up from a shirt underneath. His thick gloves had\ncollars of their own that extended halfway back around his forearms.\nDead eyes. This was Darkness himself.\nOh no.\n“What is the meaning of this!” demanded one of the viziers, a woman in\none of their large coats with the too-big sleeves. Her cap was of a different\npattern, and it clashed quite spectacularly with the coat.\n“I am here,” Darkness said, “for a thief.”\n“Do you realize where you are? How dare you interrupt—”\n“I have,” Darkness said, “the proper forms.” He spoke completely\nwithout emotion. No annoyance at being challenged, no arrogance or\npomposity. Nothing at all. One of his minions entered behind him, a man in\na black and silver uniform, less ornamented. He proffered a neat stack of\npapers to his master."

Wyndle moved beside her\nin a streak.\nShe tore a hunk off the roll with her teeth; she was going to need the\nfood. Beyond that door would be a bedroom, and a bedroom would have a\nwindow. She slammed open the door, dashing through.\nSomething swung from the shadows on the other side.\nA cudgel took her in the chest. Ribs cracked. Lift gasped, dropping face-\nfirst to the floor.\nAnother of Darkness’s minions stepped from the shadows inside the\nbedroom.\n“Even the chaotic,” Darkness said, “can be predictable with proper\nstudy.” His feet thumped across the floor behind her.\nLift gritted her teeth, curled up on the floor. Didn’t get enough to eat…\nSo hungry.\nThe few bites she’d taken earlier worked within her. She felt the\nfamiliar feeling, like a storm in her veins. Liquid awesomeness. The pain\nfaded from her chest as she healed.\nWyndle ran around her in a circle, a little lasso of vines sprouting leaves\non the floor, looping her again and again. Darkness stepped up close.\nGo! She leaped to her hands and knees. He seized her by the shoulder,\nbut she could escape that. She summoned her awesomeness.\nDarkness thrust something toward her.\nThe little animal was like a cremling, but with wings. Bound wings,\ntied-up legs. It had a strange little face, not crabbish like a cremling. More\nlike a tiny axehound, with a snout, mouth, and eyes.\nIt seemed sickly, and its shimmering eyes were pained. How could she\ntell that?\nThe creature sucked the awesomeness from Lift. She actually saw it go,\na glistening whiteness that streamed from her to the little animal. It opened\nits mouth, drinking it in.\nSuddenly, Lift felt very tired and very, very hungry.\nDarkness handed the animal to one of his minions, who made it vanish\ninto a black sack he then tucked in his pocket. Lift was certain that the\nviziers—standing in an outraged cluster at the table—hadn’t seen any of\nthis, not with Darkness’s back to them and the two minions crowding\naround.\n“Keep all spheres from her,” Darkness said. “She must not be allowed\nto Invest.”\nLift felt terror, panicked in a way she hadn’t known for years, ever since\nher days in Rall Elorim. She struggled, thrashing, biting at the hand that\nheld her. Darkness didn’t even grunt. He hauled her to her feet, and another\nminion took her by the arms, wrenching them backward until she gasped at\nthe pain.\nNo. She’d freed herself! She couldn’t be taken like this. Wyndle\ncontinued to spin around her on the ground, distressed. He was a good type,"

He was a good type,\nfor a Voidbringer.\nDarkness turned to the viziers. “I will trouble you no further.”\n“Mistress!” Wyndle said. “Here!”\nThe half-eaten roll lay on the floor. She’d dropped it when the cudgel\nhit. Wyndle ran into it, but he couldn’t do anything more than make it\nwobble. Lift thrashed, trying to pull free, but without that storm inside of\nher, she was just a child in the grip of a trained soldier.\n“I am highly disturbed by the nature of this incursion, constable,” the\nlead vizier said, shuffling through the stack of papers that Darkness had\ndropped. “Your paperwork is in order, and I see you even included a plea—\ngranted by the arbiters—to search the palace itself for this urchin. Surely\nyou did not need to disturb a holy conclave. For a common thief, no less.”\n“Justice waits upon no man or woman,” Darkness said, completely\ncalm. “And this thief is anything but common. With your leave, we will\ncease disturbing you.”\nHe didn’t seem to care if they gave him leave or not. He strode toward\nthe door, and his minion pulled Lift along after. She got her foot out to the\nroll, but only managed to kick it forward, under the long table by the\nviziers.\n“This is a leave of execution,” the vizier said with surprise, holding up\nthe last sheet in the stack. “You will kill the child? For mere thievery?”\nKill? No. No!\n“That, in addition to trespassing in the Prime’s palace,” Darkness said,\nreaching the door. “And for interrupting a holy conclave in session.”\nThe vizier met his gaze. She held it, then wilted. “I…” she said. “Ah, of\ncourse… er… constable.”\nDarkness turned from her and pulled open the door. The vizier set one\nhand on the table and raised her other hand to her head.\nThe minion dragged Lift up to the door.\n“Mistress!” Wyndle said, twisting up nearby. “Oh… oh dear. There is\nsomething very wrong with that man! He is not right, not right at all. You\nmust use your powers.”\n“Trying,” Lift said, grunting.\n“You’ve let yourself grow too thin,” Wyndle said. “Not good. You\nalways use up the excess… Low body fat… That might be the problem. I\ndon’t know how this works!”\nDarkness hesitated beside the door and looked at the low-hanging\nchandeliers in the hallway beyond, with their mirrors and sparkling\ngemstones. He raised his hand and gestured. The minion not holding Lift\nmoved out into the hallway and found the chandelier ropes. He unwound\nthose and pulled, raising the chandeliers.\nLift tried to summon her awesomeness. Just a little more. She just\nneeded a little.\nHer body felt exhausted. Drained. She really had been overdoing it. She\nstruggled, increasingly panicked. Increasingly desperate.\nIn the hallway, the minion tied off the chandeliers high in the air."

It clipped the elbow of the minion\nholding Lift. He cursed, letting go with that hand.\nLift dove for the floor, ripping out of his grip. She squirmed forward,\ngetting underneath the table.\nThe minion seized her by the ankles.\n“What was that?” Darkness asked, his voice cold, emotionless.\n“I slipped,” the vizier said.\n“Watch yourself.”\n“Is that a threat, constable? I am beyond your reach.”\n“Nobody is beyond my reach.” Still no emotion.\nLift thrashed underneath the table, kicking at the minion. He cursed\nsoftly and hauled Lift out by her legs, then pulled her to her feet. Darkness\nwatched, face emotionless.\nShe met his gaze, eye to eye, a half-eaten roll in her mouth. She stared\nhim down, chewing quickly and swallowing.\nFor once, he showed an emotion. Bafflement. “All that,” he said, “for a\nroll?”\nLift said nothing.\nCome on…\nThey walked her down the hallway, then around the corner. One of the\nminions ran ahead and purposefully removed the spheres from the lamps on\nthe walls. Were they robbing the place? No, after she passed, the minion ran\nback and restored the spheres.\nCome on…\nThey passed a palace guard in the larger hallway beyond. He noted\nsomething about Darkness—perhaps that rope tied around his upper arm,\nwhich was threaded with an Azish sequence of colors—and saluted.\n“Constable, sir? You found another one?”\nDarkness stopped, looking as the guard opened the door beside him.\nInside, Gawx sat on a chair, slumped between two other guards.\n“So you did have accomplices!” shouted one of the guards in the room.\nHe slapped Gawx across the face.\nWyndle gasped from just behind her. “That was certainly uncalled for!”\nCome on…\n“This one is not your concern,” Darkness said to the guards, waiting as\none of his minions did the strange gemstone-moving sequence. Why did\nthey worry about that?\nSomething stirred inside of Lift. Like the little swirls of wind at the\nadvent of a storm.\nDarkness looked at her with a sharp motion. “Something is—”\nAwesomeness returned.\nLift became Slick, every part of her but her feet and the palms of her\nhands. She yanked her arm—it slipped from the minion’s fingers—then\nkicked herself forward and fell to her knees, sliding under Darkness’s hand\nas he reached for her.\nWyndle let out a whoop, zipping along beside her as she began slapping\nthe floor like she was swimming, using each swing of her arms to push\nherself forward. She skimmed the floor of the palace hallway, knees sliding\nacross it as if it were greased.\nThe posture wasn’t particularly dignified.

She crashed\ninto the wall at the end of the hallway instead, a sprawling heap of limbs.\nShe came out of it with a grin. That had gone way better than the last\nfew times she’d tried this. Her first attempt had been super embarrassing.\nShe’d been so Slick, she hadn’t even been able to stay on her knees.\n“Lift!” Wyndle said. “Behind.”\nShe glanced down the hallway. She could swear he was glowing faintly,\nand he was certainly running too quickly.\nDarkness was awesome too.\n“That is not fair!” Lift shouted, scrambling to her feet and dashing down\na side hallway—the way she’d come when sneaking with Gawx. Her body\nhad already started to feel tired again. One roll didn’t get it far.\nShe sprinted down the lavish hallway, causing a maid to jump back,\nshrieking as if she’d seen a rat. Lift skidded around a corner, dashed toward\nthe nice scents, and burst into the kitchens.\nShe ran through the mess of people inside. The door slammed open\nbehind her a second later. Darkness.\nIgnoring startled cooks, Lift leaped up onto a long counter, Slicking her\nleg and riding on it sideways, knocking off bowls and pans, causing a\nclatter. She came down off the other end of the counter as Darkness shoved\nhis way past cooks in a clump, his Shardblade held up high.\nHe didn’t curse in annoyance. A fellow should curse. Made people feel\nreal when they did that.\nBut of course, Darkness wasn’t a real person. Of that, though little else,\nshe was sure.\nLift snatched a sausage off a steaming plate, then pushed into the\nservant hallways. She chewed as she ran, Wyndle growing along the wall\nbeside her, leaving a streak of dark green vines.\n“Where are we going?” he asked.\n“Away.”\nThe door into the servant hallways slammed open behind her. Lift\nturned a corner, surprising an equerry. She went awesome, and threw\nherself to the side, easily slipping past him in the narrow hallway.\n“What has become of me?” Wyndle asked. “Thieving in the night,\nchased by abominations. I was a gardener. A wonderful gardener! Cryptics\nand honorspren alike came to see the crystals I grew from the minds of your\nworld. Now this. What have I become?”\n“A whiner,” Lift said, puffing.\n“Nonsense.”\n“So you were always one of those, then?” She looked over her shoulder.\nDarkness casually shoved down the equerry, barely breaking stride as he\ncharged over the man.\nLift reached a doorway and slammed her shoulder against it, scrambling\nout into the rich hallways again.\nShe needed an exit.

She picked a direction by instinct and\nstarted running, but one of Darkness’s minions appeared around a corner\nthat way. He also carried a Shardblade. Some starvin’ luck, she had.\nLift turned the other way and passed by Darkness striding out of the\nservant hallways. She barely dodged a swing of his Blade by diving,\nSlicking herself, and sliding along the floor. She made it to her feet without\nstumbling this time. That was something, at least.\n“Who are these men?” Wyndle asked from beside her.\nLift grunted.\n“Why do they care so much about you? There’s something about those\nweapons they carry…”\n“Shardblades,” Lift said. “Worth a whole kingdom. Built to kill\nVoidbringers.” And they had two of the things. Crazy.\nBuilt to kill Voidbringers…\n“You!” she said, still running. “They’re after you!”\n“What? Of course they aren’t!”\n“They are. Don’t worry. You’re mine. I won’t lettem have you.”\n“That’s endearingly loyal,” Wyndle said. “And not a little insulting. But\nthey are not after—”\nThe second of Darkness’s minions stepped out into the hallway ahead of\nher. He held Gawx.\nHe had a knife to the young man’s throat.\nLift stumbled to a halt. Gawx, in far over his head, whimpered in the\nman’s hands.\n“Don’t move,” the minion said, “or I will kill him.”\n“Starvin’ bastard,” Lift said. She spat to the side. “That’s dirty.”\nDarkness thumped up behind her, the other minion joining him. They\npenned her in. The entrance to the Prime’s quarters was actually just ahead,\nand the viziers and scions had flooded out into the hallway, where they\njabbered to one another in outraged tones.\nGawx was crying. Poor fool.\nWell. This sorta thing never ended well. Lift went with her gut—which\nwas basically what she always did—and called the minion’s bluff by\ndashing forward. He was a lawman type. Wouldn’t kill a captive in cold—\nThe minion slit Gawx’s throat.\nCrimson blood poured out and stained Gawx’s clothing. The minion\ndropped him, then stumbled back, as if startled by what he’d done.\nLift froze. He couldn’t— He didn’t—\nDarkness grabbed her from behind.\n“That was poorly done,” Darkness said to the minion, tone emotionless.\nLift barely heard him. So much blood. “You will be punished.”\n“But…” the minion said. “I had to do as I threatened…”\n“You have not done the proper paperwork in this kingdom to kill that\nchild,” Darkness said.\n“Aren’t we above their laws?”\nDarkness actually let go of her, striding over to slap the minion across\nthe face. “Without the law, there is nothing. You will subject yourself to\ntheir rules, and accept the dictates of justice.

She barreled into the Prime’s quarters, slid across the\ntable, snatched another roll off the platter, and burst into the bedroom. She\nwas out the window a second later.\n“Up,” she said to Wyndle, then stuffed the roll in her mouth. He\nstreaked up the side of the wall, and Lift climbed, sweating. A second later,\none of the minions leaped out the window beneath her.\nHe didn’t look up. He charged out onto the grounds, twisting about,\nsearching, his Shardblade flashing in the darkness as it reflected starlight.\nLift safely reached the upper reaches of the palace, hidden in the\nshadows there. She squatted down, hands around her knees, feeling cold.\n“You barely knew him,” Wyndle said. “Yet you mourn.”\nShe nodded.\n“You’ve seen much death,” Wyndle said. “I know it. Aren’t you\naccustomed to it?”\nShe shook her head.\nBelow, the minion moved off, hunting farther and farther for her. She\nwas free. Climb across the roof, slip down on the other side, disappear.\nWas that motion on the wall at the edge of the grounds? Yes, those\nmoving shadows were men. The other thieves were climbing their wall and\ndisappearing into the night. Huqin had left his nephew, as expected.\nWho would cry for Gawx? Nobody. He’d be forgotten, abandoned.\nLift released her legs and crawled across the curved bulb of the roof\ntoward the window she’d entered earlier. Her vines from the seeds, unlike\nthe ones Wyndle grew, were still alive. They’d overgrown the window,\nleaves quivering in the wind.\nRun, her instincts said. Go.\n“You spoke of something earlier,” she whispered. “Re…”\n“Regrowth,” he said. “Each bond grants power over two Surges. You\ncan influence how things grow.”\n“Can I use this to help Gawx?”\n“If you were better trained? Yes. As it stands, I doubt it. You aren’t very\nstrong, aren’t very practiced. And he might be dead already.”\nShe touched one of the vines.\n“Why do you care?” Wyndle asked again. He sounded curious. Not a\nchallenge. An attempt to understand.\n“Because someone has to.”\nFor once, Lift ignored what her gut was telling her and, instead, climbed\nthrough the window. She crossed the room in a dash.\nOut into the upstairs hallway. Onto the steps. She soared down them,\nleaping most of the distance. Through a doorway. Turn left. Down the\nhallway.

A\nshimmering something left her lips, a little cloud of glowing light. It hung\nin front of Gawx’s lips.\nCome on…\nIt stirred, then drew in through his mouth.\nA hand took Lift by the shoulder, pulling her away from Gawx. She\nsagged, suddenly exhausted.

She\nstumbled, but he held her upright. “I had wondered which of the two you\nwould be.”\n“Miracle!” one vizier said.\n“Yaezir has spoken!” said one of the scions.\n“Edgedancer,” Lift said. “I don’t know what that is.”\n“They were once a glorious order,” Darkness said, walking her down\nthe hallway. Everyone ignored them, focused instead on Gawx. “Where you\nblunder, they were elegant things of beauty. They could ride the thinnest\nrope at speed, dance across rooftops, move through a battlefield like a\nribbon on the wind.”\n“That sounds… amazing.”\n“Yes.

You have become one of them.”\n“I didn’t mean to,” Lift said.\n“I realize this.”\n“Why… why do you hunt me?”\n“In the name of justice.”\n“There are tons of people who do wrong things,” she said. She had to\nforce out every word. Talking was hard. Thinking was hard. So tired.\n“You… you coulda hunted big crime bosses, murderers. You chose me\ninstead.

Wyndle moved up beside her, spreading\nout a starburst of creeping vines.\nDarkness knelt next to her. He held out his hand.\n“I saved him,” Lift said. “I did something good, didn’t I?”\n“Goodness is irrelevant,” Darkness said. His Shardblade dropped into\nhis fingers.\n“You don’t even care, do you?”\n“No,” he said. “I don’t.”\n“You should,” she said, exhausted. “You should… should try it, I mean.\nI wanted to be like you, once. Didn’t work out. Wasn’t… even like being\nalive…”\nDarkness raised his Blade.\nLift closed her eyes.\n“She is pardoned!”\nDarkness’s grip on her shoulder tightened.\nFeeling completely drained—like somebody had held her up by the toes\nand squeezed everything out of her—Lift forced her eyes to open. Gawx\nstumbled to a stop beside them, breathing heavily. Behind, the viziers and\nscions moved up as well.\nClothing bloodied, his eyes wide, Gawx clutched a piece of paper in his\nhand. He thrust this at Darkness. “I pardon this girl. Release her,\nconstable!”\n“Who are you,” Darkness said, “to do such a thing?”\n“I am the Prime Aqasix,” Gawx declared. “Ruler of Azir!”\n“Ridiculous.”\n“The Kadasixes have spoken,” said one of the scions.\n“The Heralds?” Darkness said. “They have done no such thing. You are\nmistaken.”\n“We have voted,” said a vizier. “This young man’s application was the\nbest.”\n“What application?” Darkness said. “He is a thief!”\n“He performed the miracle of Regrowth,” said one of the older scions.\n“He was dead and he returned. What better application could we ask for?”\n“A sign has been given,” said the lead vizier. “We have a Prime who can\nsurvive the attacks of the One All White. Praise to Yaezir, Kadasix of Kings,\nmay he lead in wisdom. This youth is Prime. He has been Prime always. We\nhave only now realized it, and beg his forgiveness for not seeing the truth\nsooner.”\n“As it always has been done,” the elderly scion said. “As it will be done\nagain. Stand down, constable. You have been given an order.”\nDarkness studied Lift.\nShe smiled tiredly. Show the starvin’ man some teeth. That was the right\nof it.\nHis Shardblade vanished to mist. He’d been bested, but he didn’t seem\nto care. Not a curse, not even a tightening of the eyes. He stood up and\npulled on his gloves by the cuffs, first one, then the other. “Praise Yaezir,”\nhe said. “Herald of Kings. May he lead in wisdom. If he ever stops\ndrooling.”"

Szeth\nSzeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, sat atop the highest tower\nin the world and contemplated the End of All Things.\nThe souls of the people he had murdered lurked in the shadows. They\nwhispered to him. If he drew close, they screamed.\nThey also screamed when he shut his eyes. He had taken to blinking as\nlittle as possible. His eyes felt dry in his skull. It was what any… sane man\nwould do.\nThe highest tower in the world, hidden in the tops of the mountains, was\nperfect for his contemplation. If he had not been bound to an Oathstone, if\nhe had been another man entirely, he would have stayed here. The only\nplace in the East where the stones were not cursed, where walking on them\nwas allowed. This place was holy.\nBright sunlight shone down to banish the shadows, which kept those\nscreams to a minimum. The screamers deserved their deaths, of course.\nThey should have killed Szeth. I hate you. I hate… everyone. Glories\nwithin, what a strange emotion.\nHe did not look up. He would not meet the gaze of the God of Gods.\nBut it was good to be in the sunlight. There were no clouds here to bring the\ndarkness. This place was above them all. Urithiru ruled even the clouds.\nThe massive tower was also empty; that was another reason he liked it.\nA hundred levels, built in ring shapes, each one beneath larger than the one\nabove it to provide a sunlit balcony. The eastern side, however, was a sheer,\nflat edge that made the tower look from a distance as if that side had been\nsliced off by an enormous Shardblade. What a strange shape.\nHe sat on that edge, right at the top, feet swinging over a drop of a\nhundred massive stories and a plummet down the mountainside below.\nGlass sparkled on the smooth surface of the flat side there.\nGlass windows. Facing east, toward the Origin. The first time he had\nvisited this place—just after being exiled from his homeland—he hadn’t\nunderstood just how odd those windows were. Back then, he’d still been\naccustomed to gentle highstorms. Rain, wind, and meditation.\nThings were different in these cursed lands of the stonewalkers. These\nhateful lands. These lands flowing with blood, death, and screams. And…\nAnd…\nBreathe. He forced the air in and out and stood up on the rim of the\nparapet atop the tower."

He forced the air in and out and stood up on the rim of the\nparapet atop the tower.\nHe had fought an impossibility. A man with Stormlight, a man who\nknew the storm within. That meant… problems. Years ago, Szeth had been\nbanished for raising the alarm. The false alarm, it had been said.\nThe Voidbringers are no more, they had told him.\nThe spirits of the stones themselves promised it.\nThe powers of old are no more.\nThe Knights Radiant are fallen.\nWe are all that remains.\nAll that remains… Truthless.\n“Have I not been faithful?” Szeth shouted, finally looking up to face the\nsun. His voice echoed against the mountains and their spirit-souls. “Have I\nnot obeyed, kept my oath? Have I not done as you demanded of me?”\nThe killing, the murder. He blinked tired eyes.\nSCREAMS.\n“What does it mean if the Shamanate are wrong? What does it mean if\nthey banished me in error?”\nIt meant the End of All Things. The end of truth. It would mean that\nnothing made sense, and that his oath was meaningless.\nIt would mean he had killed for no reason.\nHe dropped off the side of the tower, white clothing—now a symbol to\nhim of many things—flapping in the wind. He filled himself with\nStormlight and Lashed himself southward. His body lurched in that\ndirection, falling across the sky. He could only travel this way for a short\ntime; his Stormlight did not last long.\nToo imperfect a body. The Knights Radiant… they’d been said… they’d\nbeen said to be better at this… like the Voidbringers.\nHe had just enough Light to free himself from the mountains and land in\na village in the foothills. They often set out spheres for him there as an\noffering, considering him some kind of god. He would feed upon that Light,\nand it would let him go a farther distance until he found another city and\nmore Stormlight.\nIt would take days to get where he was going, but he would find\nanswers.

It danced around her head, shedding\nrings of light from its cometlike form. Horrid thing. Why would it not leave\nher alone?\nPerhaps it could not stay away. She was experiencing something\nwonderfully new, after all. Something that had not been seen in centuries.\nStormform. A form of true power.\nA form given of the gods.\nShe continued up the steps, feet clinking in her Shardplate. It felt good\non her.\nShe had held this form for fifteen days now, fifteen days of hearing new\nrhythms. At first, she had attuned those often, but this had made some\npeople very nervous.

Buried within those\nnew rhythms, the names of which she intuited somehow, she could almost\nhear voices speaking to her. Advising her. If her people had received such\nguidance over the centuries, they surely would not have fallen so far.\nEshonai reached the top of the spire, where the other four awaited her.\nAgain, her sister Venli was also there, and she wore the new form as well—\nwith its spiking armor plates, its red eyes, its lithe danger. This meeting\nwould proceed very differently from the previous one. Eshonai cycled\nthrough the new rhythms, careful not to hum them. The others weren’t\nready yet.\nShe sat down, then gasped.\nThat rhythm! It sounded like… like her own voice yelling at her.\nScreaming in pain. What was that? She shook her head, and found that she\nhad reflexively pulled her hand to her chest in anxiety. When she opened it,\nthe cometlike spren shot out.\nShe attuned Irritation. The others of the Five regarded her with heads\ncocked, a couple humming to Curiosity. Why did she act as she did?\nEshonai settled herself, Shardplate grinding against stone. This close to\nthe lull—the time called the Weeping by the humans—highstorms were\ngrowing more rare. That had created a small impediment in her march to\nsee every listener given stormform. There had only been one storm since\nEshonai’s own transformation, and during it, Venli and her scholars had\ntaken stormform along with two hundred soldiers chosen by Eshonai. Not\nofficers. Common soldiers. The type she was sure would obey.\nThe next highstorm was mere days away, and Venli had been gathering\nher spren. They had thousands ready. It was time.\nEshonai regarded the others of the Five. Today’s clear sky rained down\nwhite sunlight, and a few windspren approached on a breeze. They stopped\nwhen they grew near, then zipped away in the opposite direction.\n“Why have you called this meeting?” Eshonai asked the others.\n“You’ve been speaking of a plan,” Davim said, broad worker’s hands\nclasped before him. “You’ve been telling everyone of it. Shouldn’t you have\nbrought it to the Five first?”\n“I’m sorry,” Eshonai said. “I am merely excited. I believe, however, we\nshould now be the Six.”\n“That has not been decided,” Abronai said, weak and plump. Mateform\nwas disgusting. “This moves too quickly.”\n“We must move quickly,” Eshonai replied to Resolve. “We have only\ntwo highstorms before the lull. You know what the spies report. The\nhumans are planning a final push toward us, toward Narak.”\n“It is a pity,” Abronai said to Consideration, “that your meeting with\nthem went so poorly.”\n“They wanted to tell me of the destruction they planned to bring,”\nEshonai lied. “They wanted to gloat. That was the only reason they met\nwith me.”\n“We need to be ready to fight them,” Davim said to Anxiety."

A blatant use of emotion, but she truly felt it. “Fight\nthem? Haven’t you been listening? I can summon a highstorm.”\n“With help,” Chivi said to Curiosity. Nimbleform. Another weak form.\nThey should expunge that one from their ranks. “You have said you cannot\ndo it alone. How many others would you need? Certainly the two hundred\nyou have now are enough.”\n“No, that is not nearly enough,” Eshonai replied. “I feel that the more\npeople we have in this form, the more likely we are to succeed. I would\nlike, therefore, to move that we transform.”\n“Yes,” Chivi said. “But how many of us?”\n“All of us.”\nDavim hummed to Amusement, thinking it must be a joke. He trailed\noff as the rest sat in silence.\n“We will have just one chance,” Eshonai said to Resolve. “The humans\nwill leave their warcamps together, in one large army that intends to reach\nNarak during the lull. They will be completely exposed on the plateaus,\nwith no shelter. A highstorm at that time would destroy them.”\n“We don’t even truly know if you can summon one,” Abronai said to\nSkepticism.\n“That is why we need as many of us in stormform as possible,” Eshonai\nsaid. “If we miss this opportunity, our children will sing us the songs of\nCursing, assuming they even live long enough to do so. This is our chance,\nour one chance. Imagine the ten armies of men, isolated on the plateaus,\nbuffeted and overwhelmed by a tempest they could never have expected!\nWith stormform, we would be immune to its effects. If any survive, we\ncould destroy them easily.”\n“It is tempting,” Davim said.\n“I do not like the look of those who have taken this form,” Chivi said. “I\ndo not like how people clamor to be given it. Perhaps two hundred are\nenough.”\n“Eshonai,” Davim said, “how does this form feel?”\nHe was asking more than he actually said. Each form changed a person\nin some ways. Warform made you more aggressive, mateform made you\neasy to distract, nimbleform encouraged focus, and workform made you\nobedient.\nEshonai attuned Peace.\nNo. That was the screaming voice. How had she spent weeks in this\nform and not noticed?\n“I feel alive,” Eshonai said to Joy. “I feel strong, and I feel powerful. I\nfeel a connection to the world that I should have always known. Davim, this\nis like the change from dullform to one of the other forms—it is that much\nof an upgrade. Now that I hold this strength, I realize I wasn’t fully alive\nbefore.”\nShe lifted her hand and made a fist. She could feel the energy coursing\ndown her arm as the muscles flexed, though it was hidden beneath the\nShardplate.\n“Red eyes,” Abronai whispered. “Have we come to this?”"

We know what you wish.”\n“We cannot wait, unfortunately,” Eshonai said. “If we want to trap the\nAlethi armies, we will need time to transform everyone before the Alethi\nleave to search for Narak.”\n“I’m willing to try it,” Abronai said. “Perhaps we should propose a mass\ntransformation to our people.”\n“No.” Zuln spoke to Peace.\nThe dullform member of the Five sat slouched, looking at the ground\nbefore her. She almost never said anything.\nEshonai attuned Annoyance. “What was that?”\n“No,” Zuln repeated. “It is not right.”\n“I would have us all be in agreement,” Davim said. “Zuln, can you not\nlisten to reason?”\n“It is not right,” the dullform said again.\n“She is dull,” Eshonai said. “We should ignore her.”\nDavim hummed to Anxiety. “Zuln represents the past, Eshonai. You\nshouldn’t say such things of her.”\n“The past is dead.”\nAbronai joined Davim in humming to Anxiety. “Perhaps this is worth\nmore thought. Eshonai, you… do not speak as you used to. I hadn’t realized\nthe changes were so stark.”\nEshonai attuned one of the new rhythms, the Rhythm of Fury. She held\nthe song inside, and found herself humming. These were so cautious, so\nweak! They would see her people destroyed.\n“We will meet again later today,” Davim said. “Let us spend time\nconsidering. Eshonai, I would speak with you alone during that period, if\nyou are willing.”\n“Of course.”\nThey rose from their places atop the pillar. Eshonai stepped to the edge\nand looked down as the others filed down. The spire was too high to jump\nfrom, even in Shardplate. She so wanted to try.\nIt seemed that every person in the city had gathered around the base to\nawait the decision. In the weeks since Eshonai’s transformation, talk of\nwhat had happened to her—then the others—had infused the city with a\ncertain mixture of anxiety and hope. Many had come to her, begging to be\ngiven the form. They saw the chance it offered.\n“They’re not going to agree to it,” Venli said from behind once the\nothers were down. She spoke to Spite, one of the new rhythms. “You spoke\ntoo aggressively, Eshonai.”\n“Davim is with us,” Eshonai said to Confidence. “Chivi will come too,\nwith persuasion.”\n“That isn’t enough. If the Five do not come to a consensus—”\n“Don’t worry.”\n“Our people must take that form, Eshonai,” Venli said. “It is inevitable.”\nEshonai found herself attuning the new version of Amusement…"

She turned to her sister. “You knew, didn’t you? You knew\nexactly what this form would do to me. You knew this before you took the\nform yourself.”\n“I… Yes.”\nEshonai grabbed her sister by the front of her robe, then yanked her\nforward, holding her tightly. With Shardplate it was easy, though Venli\nresisted more than she should have been able to, and a small spark of red\nlightning ran across the woman’s arms and face. Eshonai was not\naccustomed to such strength from her scholar of a sister.\n“You could have destroyed us,” Eshonai said. “What if this form had\ndone something terrible?”\nScreaming. In her head. Venli smiled.\n“How did you discover this?” Eshonai asked. “It didn’t come from the\nsongs. There is more.”\nVenli did not speak. She met Eshonai’s eyes and hummed to\nConfidence. “We must make certain the Five agree to this plan,” she said.\n“If we are to survive, and if we are to defeat the humans, we must be in this\nform—all of us. We must summon that storm. It has been… waiting,\nEshonai. Waiting and building.”\n“I will see to it,” Eshonai said, dropping Venli. “You can gather enough\nspren for us to transform all of our people?”\n“My staff have been working on it these three weeks. We will be ready\nto transform thousands upon thousands over the course of the final two\nhighstorms before the lull.”\n“Good.” Eshonai started down the steps.\n“Sister?” Venli asked. “You are planning something. What is it? How\nwill you persuade the Five?”\nEshonai continued down the steps. With the added balance and strength\nof Shardplate, she didn’t need to bother with the chains to steady herself. As\nshe neared the bottom, where the others of the Five were speaking to the\npeople, she stopped a short distance above the crowd and drew in a deep\nbreath.\nThen, as loudly as she could, Eshonai shouted, “In two days, I will take\nany who wish to go into the storm and give them this new form.”\nThe crowd stilled, their humming dropping off.\n“The Five seek to deny you this right,” Eshonai bellowed. “They don’t\nwant you to have this form of power. They are frightened, like cremlings\nhiding in cracks. They cannot deny you! It is the right of every person to\nchoose their own form.”\nShe raised her hands above her head, humming to Resolve, and\nsummoned a storm.\nA tiny one, a mere trickle compared to what waited. It grew between her\nhands, a wind coursing with lightning. A miniature tempest in her palms,\nlight and power, wind spinning in a vortex. It had been centuries since this\npower had been used, and so—like a river that had been dammed—the\nenergy waited impatiently to be freed.\nThe tempest grew so that it whipped at her clothing, spinning around"

Finally, it\ndissipated. She heard Awe being sung throughout the crowd—full songs,\nnot humming. Their emotions were strong.\n“With this power,” Eshonai declared, “we can destroy the Alethi and\nprotect our people. I have seen your despair. I have heard you sing to\nMourning. It need not be so! Come with me into the storms. It is your right,\nyour duty, to join with me.”\nBehind her on the steps, Venli hummed to Tension. “This will divide us,\nEshonai. Too aggressive, too abrupt!”\n“It will work,” Eshonai said to Confidence. “You do not know them as I\ndo.”\nBelow, the other members of the Five were glaring up at her, looking\nbetrayed, though she could not hear their songs.\nEshonai marched to the bottom of the spire, then pushed her way\nthrough the crowd, being joined by her soldiers in stormform. The people\nmade way for her, many humming to Anxiety. Most who had come were\nworkers or nimbleforms. That made sense. The warforms were too\npragmatic for gawking.\nEshonai and her stormform warriors left the town’s center ring. She\nallowed Venli to tag along behind, but paid the woman no heed. Eshonai\neventually approached the barracks on the leeward side of the city, a large\ngroup of buildings built together to form a community for the soldiers.\nThough her troops were not required to sleep here, many did so.\nThe practice grounds one plateau over were busy with the sounds of\nwarriors honing their skills, or—more likely—newly transformed soldiers\nbeing trained. The second division, a hundred and twenty-eight in number,\nwere away watching for humans entering the middle plateaus. Scouts in\nwarpairs roamed the Plains. She’d set them on this task soon after obtaining\nher form, as she had known even then that she would need to change the\nway this battle worked. She wanted every bit of information about the\nAlethi and their current tactics that she could get.\nHer soldiers would ignore chrysalises for the time being. She would not\nlose soldiers to that petty game any longer, not when each man and woman\nunder her command represented the potential of stormform.\nThe other divisions were all here, however. Seventeen thousand soldiers\ntotal. A mighty force in some ways, but also so few, compared to what they\nhad once been. She raised her hand in a fist, and her stormform division\nraised the call for all soldiers in the listener army to gather. Those practicing\nset down their weapons and jogged over. Others left the barracks. In a short\ntime, all had joined her.\n“It is time to end the fight against the Alethi,” Eshonai announced in a\nloud voice. “Which of you are willing to follow me in doing so?”\nHumming to Resolve moved through the crowd. So far as she could\nhear, not a one hummed to Skepticism. Excellent.\n“This will require each soldier to join me in this form,” Eshonai"

If there are any here who do not wish to change, I would\nknow of it personally. It is your decision, by right, and I will not force you\n—but I must know.”\nShe looked to her stormforms, who saluted and broke apart, moving in\nwarpairs. Eshonai stepped back, folding her arms, watching as these visited\neach other division in turn. The new rhythms thrummed in her skull, though\nshe stayed away from the Rhythm of Peace, with its strange screams. There\nwas no fighting against what she had become. The eyes of the gods were\ntoo strongly upon her.\nNearby, some soldiers gathered, familiar faces beneath hardened\nskullplates, the men bearing bits of gemstone tied to their beards. Her own\ndivision, once her friends.\nShe could not quite explain why she had not chosen them at first for the\ntransformation, instead picking two hundred soldiers from across many\ndivisions. She’d needed soldiers who were obedient, but not known for their\nbrightness.\nThude and the soldiers of Eshonai’s former division… they knew her\ntoo well. They would have questioned.\nSoon, she had gotten word. Of her seventeen thousand troops, only a\nhandful refused the required transformation. Those who had declined were\ngathered on the practice grounds.\nAs she contemplated her next move, Thude approached. Tall and thick-\nlimbed, he had always worn warform save for two weeks as a mate to Bila.\nHe hummed to Resolve—the way for a soldier to indicate a willingness to\nobey orders.\n“I am worried about this, Eshonai,” he said. “Do so many need to\nchange?”\n“If we do not transform,” Eshonai said, “we are dead. The humans will\nruin us.”\nHe continued to hum to Resolve, to indicate he trusted her. His eyes\nseemed to tell another story.\nMelu, of her stormforms, returned and saluted. “The counting is\nfinished, sir.”\n“Excellent,” Eshonai said. “Pass word to the troops. We’re going to do\nthe same thing for everyone in the city.”\n“Everyone?” Thude said to Anxiety.\n“Our time is short,” Eshonai said. “If we do not act, we will miss our\nopportunity to move against the humans. We have two storms left; I want\nevery willing person in this city ready to take up stormform before those\nhave passed us. Those who will not are given that right, but I want them\ngathered so we may know where we stand.”\n“Yes, General,” Melu said.\n“Use a tight scouting formation,” Eshonai said, pointing toward parts of\nthe city. “Move through the streets, counting every person. Use the non-\nstormform divisions too, for speed. Tell the common people that we’re\ntrying to determine how many soldiers we will have for the coming battle,"

Put those people who are\nwilling to transform into the central ring. Send those who are unwilling out\nhere. Give them an escort so that they do not get lost.”\nVenli stepped up to her as Melu passed the word, sending ranks out to\nobey. Thude rejoined his division.\nEvery half year, they did an accounting to determine their numbers and\nsee if the forms were properly balanced. Once in a while, they would need\nmore volunteers to become mates or workers. Most often, they needed more\nwarforms.\nThat meant this exercise was familiar to the soldiers, and they took\neasily to the orders. After years of war, they were accustomed to doing as\nshe said. Many had the same depression that the regular people expressed—\nonly for the troops, it manifested as bloodlust. They just wanted to fight.\nThey would probably have charged head-on against the human\nencampments, and ten times their own numbers, if Eshonai ordered.\nThe Five all but handed this to me, she thought as the first of the\nunwilling began to trickle out of the city, guarded by her soldiers.

They huddled together, afraid, despite the soft songs\nof the soldiers. “Will your troops be able to do it?”\n“No,” Eshonai said, shaking her head. “Many would resist us if we did\nthis now. We will have to wait for all of my soldiers to be transformed.\nThey will not object then.”\n“That’s sloppy,” Venli said to Spite. “I thought you commanded their\nloyalty.”\n“Do not question me,” Eshonai said. “I control this city, not you.”\nVenli quieted, though her humming to Spite continued. She would\nattempt to seize control from Eshonai. It was an uncomfortable realization,\nas was the realization of how deeply Eshonai herself wanted to be in\ncontrol. That didn’t feel like her.

The dictates of the Five rule us, not the will of a\nsingle person! Can’t you see that the form, the new form is overriding her!\nYou’ve all lost your minds! Or… or worse.”\nIt was discomfortingly close to the truth.\n“Put him with the others,” Eshonai said, gesturing toward the group of\ndissidents. “What of the rest of the Five?”\n“They agreed,” Melu said. “Some were reluctant, but they agreed.”\n“Go and fetch Zuln. Put her with the dissenters. I don’t trust her to do\nwhat is needed.”\nThe soldier didn’t question as she towed Abronai away. There were\nperhaps a thousand dissenters there on the large plateau that made up the\npractice grounds. An acceptably small number.\n“Eshonai…” The song was sung to Anxiety. She turned as Thude\napproached. “I don’t like this, what we’re doing here.”\nBother. She had worried that he would be difficult. She took him by the\narm, leading him a ways off. The new rhythms cycled through her mind as\nher armored feet crunched on the stones. Once they were far enough away\nfrom Venli and the others for some privacy, she turned Thude to look him in\nthe eyes.\n“Out with it,” she said to Irritation, picking one of the old, familiar\nrhythms for him.\n“Eshonai,” he said quietly. “This isn’t right. You know it’s not right. I\nagreed to change—every soldier did—but it’s not right.”\n“Do you disagree that we needed new tactics in this war?” Eshonai said\nto Resolve. “We were dying slowly, Thude.”\n“We did need new tactics,” Thude said. “But this… Something’s wrong\nwith you, Eshonai.”\n“No, I just needed an excuse for such extreme action. Thude, I’ve been\nconsidering something like this for months.”\n“A coup?”\n“Not a coup. A refocusing. We are doomed if we don’t change our\nmethods! My only hope was Venli’s research. The only thing she turned up\nwas this form. Well, I’ve got to try and use it, make one last attempt to save\nour people. The Five tried to stop me. I’ve heard you yourself complain\nabout how much they talk instead of acting.”\nHe hummed to Consideration. She knew him well enough, however, to\nsense when he was forcing a rhythm. The beat was too obvious, too strong.\nI almost convinced him, she thought. It’s the red eyes. I’ve instilled in\nhim, and some of the others of my own division, too much of a fear of our\ngods.\nIt was a shame, but she’d probably have to see him, and her other\nformer friends, executed.\n“I see you’re not convinced,” Eshonai said.\n“I just… I don’t know, Eshonai. This seems bad.”\n“I’ll talk you through it later,” Eshonai said. “I don’t have time right\nnow.”\n“And what are you going to do to those?” Thude asked, nodding toward"

Eshonai… did you realize your own mother was among\nthem?”\nShe started, looking and seeing her aging mother being guided to the\ngroup by two stormforms. They hadn’t even come to her with the question.\nDid that mean they were extra obedient, following her orders no matter\nwhat, or were they worried she would weaken because her mother refused\nto change?\nShe could hear her mother singing. One of the old songs, as she was\nguided.\n“You can watch over that group,” Eshonai said to Thude. “You and\nsoldiers you trust. I’ll put my own division in charge of the people there,\nyou at their head. That way, nothing will happen to them without your\nagreement.”\nHe hesitated, then nodded, humming to Consideration for real this time.\nShe let him go and he jogged over to Bila and a few others of Eshonai’s\nformer division.\nPoor, trusting Thude, she thought as he took command of guarding the\ndissenters. Thank you for rounding yourself up so neatly.\n“This was handled well,” Venli said as Eshonai walked back to her.\n“Can you control the city long enough for the transformation?”\n“Easily,” Eshonai said, nodding to the soldiers who came to give her a\nreport. “Just make certain you can deliver the proper spren and in the proper\nquantities.”\n“I will,” Venli said to Satisfaction.\nEshonai took the reports. Everyone who had agreed was gathered in the\ncenter of the city. It was time to speak to them and deliver the lies she’d\nprepared. That the Five would be reinstated once the humans were dealt\nwith, that there was no reason to worry. That everything was just fine.\nEshonai strode into a city that was now hers, flanked by soldiers in the\nnew form. She summoned her Blade for effect, the last one her people\nowned, resting it on her shoulder.\nShe made her way to the center of the city, passing melted buildings and\nshacks built from carapace. It was a wonder that those things survived the\nstorms. Her people deserved better. With the return of the gods, they would\nhave better.\nIrritatingly, it took some time to get the people ready for her speech.\nSome twenty thousand non-warforms gathered together was quite a sight;\nlooking upon them, the city’s population did not seem nearly so small. Still,\nthis was a fraction of their original numbers.\nHer soldiers seated them all, prepared messengers to deliver her words\nto those not near enough to hear. As she waited for the preparations, she\nlistened to reports regarding the population. Surprisingly, the majority of\nthose who had dissented were workers. They were supposed to be obedient.\nWell, the greater number of them were elderly, the ones who had not fought\nin the war against the Alethi.

Missing the wind. The solitude\ndidn’t bother him. Those walls, though. They felt like they were crushing\nhim.\nOn the third day of his imprisonment, he heard a disturbance from\nfarther inside the prison, beyond his chamber. He stood up, ignoring Syl,\nwho sat on an invisible bench on his wall. What was that shouting? It\nechoed in from the hallway.\nHis little cell was in its own room. The only people he’d seen since\nbeing locked up were the guards and the servants. Spheres glowed on the\nwalls, keeping the place well lit. Spheres in a room meant for criminals.\nWere they there to taunt the men locked away? Riches just beyond reach.\nHe pressed against the cold bars, listening to the indistinct shouts. He\nimagined Bridge Four having come to break him out. Stormfather send they\ndidn’t try something so foolish.\nHe eyed one of the spheres in its setting on the wall.\n“What?” Syl asked him.\n“I might be able to get close enough to suck that Light out. It’s only a\nlittle farther than the Parshendi were when I drew the Light from their\ngemstones.”\n“Then what?” Syl asked, voice small.\nGood question. “Would you help me break out, if I wanted to?”\n“Do you want to?”\n“I’m not sure.” He turned around, still standing, and rested his back\nagainst the bars. “I might need to. Breaking out would be against the law,\nthough.”\nShe lifted her chin. “I’m no highspren. Laws don’t matter; what’s right\nmatters.”\n“On that point, we agree.”\n“But you came willingly,” Syl said. “Why would you leave now?”\n“I won’t let them execute me.”\n“They’re not going to,” Syl said. “You heard Dalinar.”\n“Dalinar can go rot. He let this happen.”\n“He tried to—”\n“He let it happen!” Kaladin snapped, turning and slamming his hands\nagainst the bars. Another storming cage. He was right back where he’d\nbegun! “He’s the same as the others,” Kaladin growled.\nSyl zipped over to him, coming to rest between the bars, hands on hips.\n“Say that again.”\n“He…” Kaladin turned away. Lying to her was hard. “All right, fine.\nHe’s not. But the king is. Admit it, Syl. Elhokar is a terrible king. At first he\nlauded me for trying to protect him. Now, at the snap of his fingers, he’s\nwilling to execute me. He’s a child.”\n“Kaladin, you’re scaring me.”\n“Am I? You told me to trust you, Syl. When I jumped down into the\narena, you said this time things would be different. How is this different?”\nShe looked away, seeming suddenly very small.\n“Even Dalinar admitted that the king had made a big mistake in letting\nSadeas wiggle out of the challenge,” Kaladin said. “Moash and his friends\nare right. This kingdom would be better off without Elhokar.”"

This kingdom would be better off without Elhokar.”\nSyl dropped to the floor, head bowed.\nKaladin walked back to his bench, but was too stirred up to sit. He\nfound himself pacing. How could a man be expected to live trapped in a\nlittle room, without fresh air to breathe? He wouldn’t let them leave him\nhere.\nYou’d better keep your word, Dalinar. Get me out. Soon.\nThe disturbance, whatever it had been, quieted. Kaladin asked the\nservant about it when she came with his food, pushing it through the small\nopening at the bottom of the bars. She wouldn’t speak to him, and scurried\noff like a cremling before a storm.\nKaladin sighed, retrieving the food—steamed vegetables, dribbled with\na salty black sauce—and flopping back on his bench. They gave him food\nhe could eat with his fingers. No forks or knives for him, just in case.\n“Nice place you have here, bridgeboy,” Wit said. “I considered moving\nin here myself on several occasions. The rent might be cheap, but the price\nof admission is quite steep.”\nKaladin scrambled up to his feet. Wit sat on a bench by the far wall,\noutside the cell and under the spheres, tuning some kind of strange\ninstrument on his lap made of taut strings and polished wood. He hadn’t\nbeen there a moment ago. Storms… had the bench even been there before?\n“How did you get in?” Kaladin asked.\n“Well, there are these things called doors…”\n“The guards let you?”\n“Technically?” Wit asked, plucking at a string, then leaning down to\nlisten as he plucked another. “Yes.”\nKaladin sat back down on the bench in his cell. Wit wore his black-on-\nblack, his thin silver sword undone from his waist and sitting on the bench\nbeside him. A brown sack slumped there as well. Wit leaned down to tune\nhis instrument, one leg crossed over the other. He hummed softly to himself\nand nodded. “Perfect pitch,” Wit said, “makes this all so much easier than it\nonce was…”\nKaladin sat, waiting, as Wit settled back against the wall. Then did\nnothing.\n“Well?” Kaladin asked.\n“Yes. Thank you.”\n“Are you going to play music for me?”\n“No. You wouldn’t appreciate it.”\n“Then why are you here?”\n“I like visiting people in prison. I can say whatever I want to them, and\nthey can’t do anything about it.” He looked up at Kaladin, then rested his\nhands on his instrument, smiling. “I’ve come for a story.”\n“What story?”\n“The one you’re going to tell me.”\n“Bah,” Kaladin said, lying back down on his bench. “I’m in no mood\nfor your games today, Wit.”\nWit plucked a note on his instrument. “Everyone always says that—\nwhich, first off, makes it a cliche. I am led to wonder. Is anyone ever in the\nmood for my games? And if they are, would that not defeat the point of my\ntype of game in the first place?”\nKaladin sighed as Wit continued to pluck out notes. “If I play along"

A man went to jail. He hated it there. The end.”\n“Ah…” Wit said. “So it’s a story about a child, then.”\n“No, it’s about—” Kaladin cut off.\nMe.\n“Perhaps a story for a child,” Wit said. “I will tell you one, to get you in\nthe mood. A bunny rabbit and a chick went frolicking in the grass together\non a sunny day.”\n“A chick… baby chicken?” Kaladin said. “And a what?”\n“Ah, forgot myself for a moment,” Wit said. “Sorry. Let me make it\nmore appropriate for you. A piece of wet slime and a disgusting crab thing\nwith seventeen legs slunk across the rocks together on an insufferably rainy\nday. Is that better?”\n“I suppose. Is the story over?”\n“It hasn’t started yet.”\nWit abruptly slapped the strings, then began to play them with ferocious\nintent. A vibrant, energetic repetition. One punctuated note, then seven in a\nrow, frenzied.\nThe rhythm got inside of Kaladin. It seemed to shake the entire room.\n“What do you see?” Wit demanded.\n“I…”\n“Close your eyes, idiot!”\nKaladin closed his eyes. This is stupid.\n“What do you see?” Wit repeated.\nWit was playing with him. The man was said to do that. He was\nsupposedly Sigzil’s old mentor. Shouldn’t Kaladin have earned a reprieve\nby helping out his apprentice?\nThere was nothing of humor to those notes. Those powerful notes. Wit\nadded a second melody, complementing the first. Was he playing that with\nhis other hand? Both at the same time? How could one man, one\ninstrument, produce so much music?\nKaladin saw… in his mind…\nA race.\n“That’s the song of a man who is running,” Kaladin said.\n“In the driest part of the brightest day, the man set off from the eastern\nsea.” Wit said it perfectly to the beat of his music, a chant that was almost a\nsong. “And where he went or why he ran, the answer comes from you to\nme.”\n“He ran from the storm,” Kaladin said softly.\n“The man was Fleet, whose name you know; he’s spoken of in song and\nlore. The fastest man e’er known to live. The surest feet e’er known to\nroam. In time long past, in times I’ve known, he raced the Herald Chan-a-\nrach. He won that race, as he did each one, but now the time for defeat had\ncome.\n“For Fleet so sure, and Fleet the quick, to all that heard he yelled his\ngoal: to beat the wind, and race a storm.

Fleet, a barefooted man. Wit claimed\nall knew of him, but Kaladin had never heard of such a story. Lanky, tall,\nwith tied-back long hair that went to his waist. Fleet took his mark on the\nshore, leaning forward in a running posture, waiting as the stormwall\nthundered and crashed across the sea toward him. Kaladin jumped as Wit\nhit a burst of notes, signaling the race’s start.\nFleet tore off just in front of an angry, violent wall of water, lightning,\nand wind-blown rocks.\nWit did not speak again until Kaladin prompted him. “At first,” Kaladin\nsaid, “Fleet did well.”\n“O’er rock and grass, our Fleet did run! He leaped the stones and\ndodged the trees, his feet a blur, his soul a sun! The storm so grand, it raged\nand spun, but away from it our Fleet did run! The lead was his, the wind\nbehind, did man now prove that storms could lose?\n“Through land he ran so quick and sure, and Alethkar he left behind.\nBut now the test he saw ahead, for mountains he would have to climb. The\nstorm surged on, released a howl; it saw its chance might now approach.\n“To the highest mounts and the coldest peaks, our hero Fleet did make\nhis way. The slopes were steep and paths unsure. Would he maintain his\nmighty lead?”\n“Obviously not,” Kaladin said. “You can never stay ahead. Not for\nlong.”\n“No! The storm grew close, ’til it chewed his heels. Upon his neck,\nFleet felt its chill. Its breath of ice was all around, a mouth of night and\nwings of frost. Its voice was of the breaking rocks; its song was of the\ncrashing rain.”\nKaladin could feel it. Icy water seeping through his clothing. Wind\nbuffeting his skin. A roar so loud that soon, he could hear nothing at all.\nHe’d been there. He’d felt it.\n“Then the tip he reached! The point he found! Fleet climbed no more;\nhe crossed the peak. And down the side, his speed returned! Outside the\nstorm, Fleet found the sun. Azir’s plains were now his path. He sprinted\nwest, more broad his stride.”\n“But he was growing weak,” Kaladin said. “No man can run that far\nwithout getting tired. Even Fleet.”\n“Yet soon the race its toll did claim. His feet like bricks, his legs like\ncloth. In gasps our runner drew his breath. The end approached, the storm\noutdone, but slowly did our hero run.”\n“More mountains,” Kaladin whispered. “Shinovar.”\n“A final challenge raised its head, a final shadow to his dread. The land"

Even going down the other side of the\nmountains, he was unable to stay very far ahead.”\n“He crossed the peaks, but lost his lead.

Would he be mad that Kaladin had made such a poor conclusion to the\nstory?\nWit stared at him, instrument still in his lap. The man didn’t seem angry.\n“So you do know this story,” Wit said.\n“What? I thought you were making it up.”\n“No, you were.”\n“Then what is there to know?”\nWit smiled. “All stories told have been told before. We tell them to\nourselves, as did all men who ever were. And all men who ever will be. The\nonly things new are the names.”\nKaladin sat up. He tapped one finger against his stone block of a bench.\n“So… Fleet. Was he real?”\n“As real as I am,” Wit said.\n“And he died?” Kaladin said. “Before he could finish the race?”\n“He died.” Wit smiled.\n“What?”\nWit attacked the instrument.

She scrabbled among the stacks of papers on the floor, tossing\naside irrelevant sheets.\nFinally, she retrieved the one she wanted, holding it up while pushing\nhair out of her eyes and tucking it behind her ears. The page was a map, one\nof those ancient ones that Jasnah had talked about. It had taken forever to\nfind a merchant at the Shattered Plains who had a copy.\n“Look,” Shallan said, holding the map beside a modern one of the same\narea, copied by her own hand from Amaram’s wall.\nBastard, she noted to herself.\nShe turned the maps around so that Pattern—who decorated the wall\nabove her headboard—could see them.\n“Maps,” he said.\n“A pattern!” Shallan exclaimed.\n“I see no pattern.”\n“Look right here,” she said, edging over beside the wall. “On this old\nmap, the area is…”\n“Natanatan,” Pattern read, then hummed softly.\n“One of the Epoch Kingdoms,” Shallan said. “Organized by the Heralds\nthemselves for divine purposes and blah blah. But look.” She stabbed the\npage with her finger. “The capital of Natanatan, Stormseat. If you were to\njudge where we’d find the ruins of it, comparing this old map to the one\nAmaram had…”\n“It would be in those mountains somewhere,” Pattern said, “between the\nwords ‘Dawn’s Shadow’ and the U in ‘Unclaimed Hills.’”"

The old map is wildly\ninaccurate. Stormseat was right here. On the Shattered Plains.”\n“That is not what the map says,” Pattern said, humming.\n“Close enough.”\n“That is not a pattern,” he said, sounding offended. “Humans; you do\nnot understand patterns. Like right now. It is second moon. Each night, you\nsleep during this time. But not tonight.”\n“I can’t sleep tonight.”\n“More information, please,” Pattern said. “Why not tonight? Is it the\nday of the week? Do you always not sleep on Jesel? Or is it the weather?\nHas it grown too warm? The position of the moons relative to—”\n“It’s none of that,” Shallan said, shrugging. “I just can’t sleep.”\n“Your body is capable of it, surely.”\n“Probably,” Shallan said. “But not my head. It surges with too many\nideas, like waves against the rocks. Rocks that… I guess… are also in my\nhead.” She cocked her head. “I don’t think that metaphor makes me sound\nparticularly bright.”\n“But—”\n“No more complaints,” Shallan said, raising a finger. “Tonight, I am\ndoing scholarship.”\nShe put the page down on her bed, then leaned over the side, fishing out\nseveral others.\n“I wasn’t complaining,” Pattern complained. He moved down onto the\nbed beside her. “I do not remember well, but did Jasnah not use a desk\nwhen… ‘doing scholarship’?”\n“Desks are for boring people,” Shallan said. “And for people who don’t\nhave a squishy bed.” Would Dalinar’s camp have had such a plush bed for\nher? Likely, the workload would have been smaller. Though, finally, she’d\nmanaged to finish sorting through Sebarial’s personal finances and was\nalmost ready to present him with a set of relatively neat books.\nIn a stroke of insight, she’d slipped a copy of one of her pages of quotes\nabout Urithiru—its potential riches, and its connection to the Shattered\nPlains—in among the other reports she’d sent Palona. At the bottom, she\nwrote, “Among Jasnah Kholin’s notes are these indications of something\nvaluable hidden out on the Shattered Plains. Will keep you informed of my\ndiscoveries.” If Sebarial thought there was opportunity beyond gemhearts\nout on the Plains, she might be able to get him to take her out there with his\narmies, in case Adolin’s promises didn’t come through.\nGetting all of that ready had left her with little time for studying,\nunfortunately. Perhaps that was why she couldn’t sleep. This would be\neasier, Shallan thought, if Navani would agree to meet with me. She’d\nwritten again, and gotten the reply that Navani was busy caring for Dalinar,\nwho had come down with a sickness. Nothing life-threatening, apparently,\nbut he had withdrawn for a few days to recuperate.\nDid Adolin’s aunt blame her for botching the dueling agreement? After\nwhat Adolin had decided to do last week… Well, at least his preoccupation"

After\nwhat Adolin had decided to do last week… Well, at least his preoccupation\nleft Shallan with some time to read and think about Urithiru. Anything other\nthan worrying about her brothers, who still hadn’t responded to her letters\npleading for them to leave Jah Keved and come to her.\n“I find sleeping very odd,” Pattern said. “I know that all beings in the\nPhysical Realm engage in it. Do you find it pleasant? You fear\nnonexistence, but is not unconsciousness the same thing?”\n“With sleep, it’s only temporary.”\n“Ah. It is all right, because in the morning, you each return to\nsentience.”\n“Well, that depends on the person,” Shallan said absently. “For many of\nthem, ‘sentience’ might be too generous a term…”\nPattern hummed, trying to sort through to the meaning of what she said.\nFinally, he buzzed an approximation of a laugh.\nShallan cocked an eyebrow at him.\n“I have guessed that what you said is humorous,” Pattern said. “Though\nI do not know why. It was not a joke. I know of jokes. A soldier came\nrunning into camp after going to see the prostitutes. He was white in the\nface. His friends asked if he had found a good time. He said that he had not.\nThey asked why. He said that when he’d asked how much the woman\ncharged, she’d said one mark plus the tip. He told his friends that he hadn’t\nrealized they were charging body parts now.”\nShallan grimaced. “You heard that from Vathah’s men, didn’t you?”\n“Yes. It is funny because the word ‘tip’ means several different things. A\npayment made in addition to the sum initially charged, usually given\nvoluntarily, and the top piece of something. In addition, I believe that ‘the\ntip’ means something in the slang of the soldiers, and so the man in the joke\nthought she was going to cut off his—”\n“Yes, thank you,” Shallan said.\n“That is a joke,” Pattern continued. “I understand why it is funny. Ha\nha. Sarcasm is similar. You replace an expected result with one grossly\nunexpected, and the humor is in the juxtaposition. But why was your earlier\ncomment funny?”\n“It’s debatable whether it was, at this point…”\n“But—”\n“Pattern, nothing is less funny than explaining humor,” Shallan said.\n“We have more important things to discuss.”\n“Mmm… Such as why you have forgotten how to make your images\nproduce sound? You did it once, long ago.” …\nShallan blinked, then held up the modern map. “The capital of\nNatanatan was here, on the Shattered Plains. The old maps are misleading.\nAmaram notes that the Parshendi use weapons of masterly design, far\nbeyond their skill in craftsmanship. Where would they have gotten those?\nFrom the ruins of the city that once was here.”\nShallan dug in her stacks of papers, getting out a map of the city itself.\nIt didn’t show the surrounding area—it was just a city map, and a rather\nvague one, taken from a book she’d purchased.

She thought it was the one\nthat Jasnah referenced in her notes.\nThe merchant she’d bought it from claimed it was ancient—that it was a\ncopy of a copy from a book in Azir that claimed to be a drawing of a tile\nmosaic depiction of the city of Stormseat. The mosaic no longer existed—\nso much of what they had of the shadowdays came from fragments like\nthese.\n“Scholars reject the idea that Stormseat was here on the Plains,” Shallan\nsaid. “They say that the craters of the warcamps don’t match the\ndescriptions of the city. Instead, they propose that the ruins must be hidden\nup in the highlands, where you indicated. But Jasnah didn’t agree with\nthem. She points out that few of the scholars have actually been here, and\nthat this area in general is poorly explored.”\n“Mmm,” Pattern said. “Shallan…”\n“I agree with Jasnah,” Shallan said, turning from him. “Stormseat\nwasn’t a large city. It could have been in the middle of the Plains, and these\ncraters something else… Amaram says here he thinks they might once have\nbeen domes. I wonder if that is even possible… They’d be so large…\nAnyway, this might have been a satellite city of some sort.”\nShallan felt like she was getting close to something. Amaram’s notes\nspoke mostly of trying to meet with the Parshendi, to ask them about the\nVoidbringers and how to return them. He did mention Urithiru, however,\nand seemed to have come to the same conclusion as Jasnah—that the\nancient city of Stormseat would have contained a path to Urithiru. Ten of\nthem had once connected the ten capitals of the Epoch Kingdoms to\nUrithiru, which had some kind of conference room for the ten monarchs of\nthe Epoch Kingdoms—and a throne for each one.\nThat was why none of the maps placed the holy city in the same\nlocation. It was ridiculous to walk there; instead, you made for the nearest\ncity with an Oathgate and used that.\nHe’s searching for the information there, Shallan thought. Same as I am.\nBut he wants to return the Voidbringers, not fight them. Why?\nShe held up the antique map of Stormseat, the copy from the mosaic. It\nhad artistic stylings instead of specific indications of things like distance\nand location. While she appreciated the former, the latter was truly\nfrustrating.\nAre you on here? she thought. The secret, the Oathgate? Are you here,\non this dais, as Jasnah thought?\n“The Shattered Plains haven’t always been shattered,” Shallan\nwhispered to herself. “That’s what the scholars, all but Jasnah, are missing.\nStormseat was destroyed during the Last Desolation, but it was so long ago,\nnobody talks about how. Fire? Earthquake? No. Something more terrible.\nThe city was broken, like a piece of fine dinnerware hit with a hammer.”\n“Shallan,” Pattern said, moving closer to her. “I know that you have\nforgotten much of what once was.

But you cannot\ncontinue like this; you must admit the truth about me. About what I can do,\nand what we have done. Mmm… More, you must know yourself. And\nremember.”\nShe sat cross-legged on the too-nice bed. Memories tried to claw their\nway out of the boxes inside her head. Those memories all pointed one way,\ntoward carpet bloodied. And carpet… not.\n“You wish to help,” Pattern said. “You wish to prepare for the\nEverstorm, the spren of the unnatural one. You must become something. I\ndid not come to you merely to teach you tricks of light.”\n“You came to learn,” Shallan said, staring at her map. “That’s what you\nsaid.”\n“I came to learn. We became to do something greater.”\n“Would you have me unable to laugh?” she demanded, suddenly\nholding back tears. “Would you have me crippled? That is what those\nmemories would do to me. I can be what I am because I cut them off.”\nAn image formed in front of her, born of Stormlight, created by instinct.\nShe hadn’t needed to draw this image first, for she knew it too well.\nThe image was of herself. Shallan, as she should be. Curled in a huddle\non the bed, unable to weep for she had long since run out of tears. This\ngirl… not a woman, a girl… flinched whenever spoken to. She expected\neveryone to shout at her. She could not laugh, for laughter had been\nsqueezed from her by a childhood of darkness and pain.\nThat was the real Shallan. She knew it as surely as she knew her own\nname. The person she had become instead was a lie, one she had fabricated\nin the name of survival. To remember herself as a child, discovering Light\nin the gardens, Patterns in the stonework, and dreams that became real… …\n“Mmmm… Such a deep lie,” Pattern whispered. “A deep lie indeed. But\nstill, you must obtain your abilities. Learn again, if you have to.”\n“Very well,” Shallan said. “But if we did this before, can’t you just tell\nme how it is done?”\n“My memory is weak,” Pattern said. “I was dumb so long, nearly dead.\nMmm. I could not speak.”\n“Yeah,” Shallan said, remembering him spinning on the ground and\nrunning into the wall. “You were kind of cute, though.” She banished the\nimage of the frightened, huddled, whimpering girl, then got out her drawing\nimplements. She tapped a pencil against her lips, then did something\nsimple, a drawing of Veil, the darkeyed con woman.\nVeil was not Shallan. Her features were different enough that the two of\nthem would be distinct individuals to anyone who happened to see them\nboth. Still, Veil did bear echoes of Shallan. She was a darkeyed, tan-\nskinned, Alethi version of Shallan—a Shallan that was a few years older\nand had a pointier nose and chin.\nFinished with the drawing, Shallan breathed out Stormlight and created\nthe image.

It stood beside the bed, arms folded, looking as confident as a\nmaster duelist facing a child with a stick.\nSound. How would she do sound? Pattern had called it a force, part of\nthe Surge of Illumination—or at least similar to it. She situated herself on\nthe bed, one leg folded beneath her, inspecting Veil. Over the next hour,\nShallan tried everything she could think of, from straining herself and\nconcentrating, to trying to draw sounds to make them appear. Nothing\nworked.\nFinally, she climbed off the bed and walked to get herself a drink from\nthe bottle chilling in the bucket in the next room. As she approached it,\nhowever, she felt a tugging inside of her. She looked over her shoulder into\nthe bedroom, and saw that the image of Veil had started to blur, like\nsmudged pencil lines.\nBlast, but that was inconvenient. Sustaining the illusion required\nShallan to provide a constant source of Stormlight. She walked back into\nthe bedroom and set a sphere on the floor inside of Veil’s foot. When she\nwalked away, the illusion still grew indistinct, like a bubble preparing to\npop. Shallan turned and put her hands on her hips, staring at the version of\nVeil that had gone all fuzzy.\n“Annoying!” she snapped.\nPattern hummed. “I’m sorry that your mystical, godlike powers do not\ninstantly work as you would like them to.”\nShe raised an eyebrow at him. “I thought you didn’t understand humor.”\n“I do. I just explained…” He paused for a moment. “Was I being funny?\nSarcasm. I was sarcastic. By accident!” He seemed surprised, even gleeful.\n“I guess you’re learning.”\n“It is the bond,” he explained. “In Shadesmar, I do not communicate this\nway, this… human way. My connection to you gives me the means by\nwhich I can manifest in the Physical Realm as more than a mindless\nglimmer. Mmmm. It links me to you, helps me communicate as you do.\nFascinating. Mmmm.”\nHe settled down like a trumping axehound, perfectly content. And then\nShallan noticed something.\n“I’m not glowing,” Shallan said. “I’m holding a lot of Stormlight, but\nI’m not glowing.”\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “Large illusion transforms the Surge into\nanother. Feeds off your Stormlight.”\nShe nodded. The Stormlight she held fed the illusion, drawing the\nexcess from her that would normally float above her skin. That could be\nuseful. As Pattern moved up onto the bed, Veil’s elbow—which was closest\nto him—grew more distinct.\nShallan frowned. “Pattern, move closer to the image.”\nHe obliged, crossing the cover of her bed toward where Veil stood. She\nunfuzzed. Not completely, but his presence made a noticeable difference.\nShallan walked over, her proximity making the illusion snap back to full\nclarity.\n“Can you hold Stormlight?” Shallan asked Pattern.\n“I don’t… I mean… Investiture is the means by which I…”"

It was an odd sensation, as if she’d trapped\nan angry cremling under the bedsheets. She pushed some Stormlight into\nhim. When she lifted her hand, he was trailing wisps of it, like steam off a\nhotplate fabrial.\n“We’re bonded,” she said. “My illusion is your illusion. I’m going to get\na drink. See if you can keep the image from breaking apart.” She backed to\nthe sitting room and smiled. Pattern, still buzzing with annoyance, moved\ndown off the bed. She couldn’t see him—the bed was in the way—but she\nguessed he’d gone to Veil’s feet.\nIt worked. The illusion stayed. “Ha!” Shallan said, getting herself a cup\nof wine. She walked back and eased onto the bed—flopping down with a\ncup of red wine did not seem prudent—and looked over the side at the floor,\nwhere Pattern sat beneath Veil. He was visible because of the Stormlight.\nI’ll need to take that into account, Shallan thought. Build illusions so\nthat he can hide in them.\n“It worked?” Pattern said. “How did you know it would work?”\n“I didn’t.” Shallan took a sip of wine. “I guessed.”\nShe drank another sip as Pattern hummed. Jasnah would not have\napproved. Scholarship requires a sharp mind and alert senses. These do not\nmix with alcohol. Shallan drank the rest of the wine in a gulp.\n“Here,” Shallan said, reaching down. She did the next bit by instinct.\nShe had a connection to the illusion, and she had a connection to Pattern,\nso…\nWith a push of Stormlight, she attached the illusion to Pattern as she\noften attached them to herself. His glow subsided. “Walk around,” she said.\n“I don’t walk…” Pattern said.\n“You know what I mean,” Shallan said.\nPattern moved, and the image moved with him. It didn’t walk,\nunfortunately. The image just kind of glided. Like light reflected onto the\nwall from a spoon you idly turned in your hands. She cheered to herself\nanyway. After so long failing to get sounds from one of her creations, this\ndifferent discovery seemed a major victory.\nCould she get it to move more naturally?

You will break off contact with that woman.”\n“She belongs to a good family!” Balat said, standing, palms on the\ntable. It was lunch, and so Shallan was expected to be here, rather than\nremaining shut up in her room. She sat to the side, at her private table. Balat\nstood facing Father across the high table.\n“Father, they’re your vassals!” Balat snapped. “You yourself have\ninvited them to dine with us.”\n“My axehounds dine at my feet,” Father said. “I do not allow my sons\nto court them. House Tavinar is not nearly ambitious enough for us. Now,\nSudi Valam, that might be worth considering.”\nBalat frowned. “The highprince’s daughter? You can’t be serious. She’s\nin her fifties!”\n“She is single.”\n“Because her husband died in a duel! Anyway, the highprince would\nnever approve it.”\n“His perception of us will change,” Father said. “We are a wealthy\nfamily now, with much influence.”\n“Yet still headed by a murderer,” Balat snapped.\nToo far! Shallan thought. On Father’s other side, Luesh laced his fingers\nin front of him. The new house steward had a face like a well-worn glove,\nleathery and wrinkled in the places most used—notably the frown lines.\nFather stood up slowly. This new anger of his, the cold anger, terrified\nShallan. “Your new axehound pups,” he said to Balat. “Terrible that they\ncaught a sickness during the latest highstorm. Tragic. It is unfortunate they\nneed to be put down.” He gestured, and one of his new guards—a man\nShallan did not know well—stepped outside, pulling his sword from its\nsheath.\nShallan grew very cold. Even Luesh grew concerned, placing a hand on\nFather’s arm.\n“You bastard,” Balat said, growing pale. “I’ll—”\n“You’ll what, Balat?” Father asked, shaking off Luesh’s touch, leaning\ntoward Balat. “Come on.

Father\neventually stood up, shoving his chair back and leaving. Luesh trailed soon\nafter.\nThat left Shallan alone with the servants.

Balat’s new pod of\npups lay dead in a pool of violet blood on the stone floor.\nShe’d encouraged Balat to breed these. He’d been making progress with\nhis demons, over the years.

She\nraised her safehand to her mouth as she drew closer to the pitiful remains.\n“Father’s guards,” Balat said. “It’s like they were waiting for a chance\nto do something like this. I don’t like the new group he has. That Levrin,\nwith the angry eyes, and Rin… that one frightens me. What ever happened\nto Ten and Beal? Soldiers that you could joke with. Almost friends…”\nShe rested a hand on his shoulder. “Balat. Did you really see Helaran?”\n“Yes. He said I wasn’t to tell anyone. He warned me that this time when\nhe left, he might not be coming back for a long time. He told me… told me\nto watch over the family.” Balat buried his head in his hands. “I can’t be\nhim, Shallan.”\n“You don’t need to be.”\n“He’s brave. He’s strong.”\n“He abandoned us.”\nBalat looked up, tears running down his cheeks. “Maybe he was right.\nMaybe that’s the only way, Shallan.”\n“Leave our house?”\n“What of it?” Balat asked. “You spend every day locked away, brought\nout only for Father to display. Jushu has gone back to his gambling—you\nknow he has, even if he’s smarter about it. Wikim talks about becoming an\nardent, but I don’t know if Father will ever let go of him.

We’d have to live\nlean, and I couldn’t trust that he’d… you know. But if you came, it might be\neasier for one of us to find work.

Particularly if Jushu and Wikim remain here.”\n“I see,” he said. “Maybe… maybe there’s another way out. I’ll think.”\nShe left him in the kennel, worried that Father would find her there and\nthat it would upset him. She entered the manor, but couldn’t help feeling\nthat she was trying to hold together a carpet as dozens of people pulled out\nthreads from the sides.\nWhat would happen if Balat left?

To her it was almost blinding, though the men in the room didn’t\nseem able to see it.\nRin bowed before Father, hand on sword.\n“Bring me his head, Rin,” Father said. “I want to see it with my own\neyes. He is the one who could ruin all of this. Surprise him, kill him before\nhe can summon his Shardblade. That weapon will be yours in payment so\nlong as you serve House Davar.”\nShallan stumbled back from the door before Father could look up and\nsee her. Helaran. Father had just ordered Helaran’s assassination.\nI have to do something. I have to warn him. How? Could Balat contact\nhim again? Shallan—\n“How dare you,” said a feminine voice within.\nStunned silence followed. Shallan edged back to look into the room.\nMalise, her stepmother, stood in the doorway between the bedroom and the\nsitting room. The small, plump woman had never seemed threatening to\nShallan before. But the storm on her face today could have frightened a\nwhitespine.\n“Your own son,” Malise said. “Have you no morals left? Have you no\ncompassion?”\n“He is no longer my son,” Father growled.\n“I believed your story about the woman before me,” Malise said. “I’ve\nsupported you. I’ve lived with this cloud over the house. Now I hear this? It\nis one thing to beat the servants, but to kill your son?”\nFather whispered something to Rin. Shallan jumped, and barely got\ndown the hallway to her room before the man slipped out of the room, then\nclosed Father’s door with a click.\nShallan shut herself in her room as the shouting started, a violent, angry\nback-and-forth between Malise and her father. Shallan huddled up beside\nthe bed, tried to use a pillow to keep out the sounds. When she thought it\nwas over, she removed the pillow.\nHer father stormed out into the hallway. “Why will nobody in this house\nobey?” he shouted, thumping down the stairs. “This wouldn’t happen if you\nall just obeyed.”\n62. The One Who Killed Promises\nThis is, I suspect, a little like a skunk naming\nitself for its stench.\nLife continued in Kaladin’s cell. Though the accommodations were nice\nfor a dungeon, he found himself wishing he were back in the slave wagon.\nAt least then he’d been able to watch the scenery. Fresh air, wind, an\noccasional rinse in the highstorm’s last rains. Life certainly hadn’t been\ngood, but it had been better than being locked away and forgotten.\nThey took the spheres away at night, abandoning him to blackness. In\nthe dark, he found himself imagining that he was someplace deep, with\nmiles of stone above him and no pathway out, no hope of rescue. He could\nnot conceive a worse death. Better to be gutted on the battlefield, looking\nup at the open sky as your life leaked away.\n* * *\nLight awoke him.

He’d placed his chamber pot in reach of the opening at\nthe bottom of the bars, and it scraped stone as she pulled it out and replaced\nit with a fresh one.\nShe scurried away. He frightened her. With a groan at stiff muscles,\nKaladin sat up and regarded his meal. Flatbread stuffed with bean paste. He\nstood, waving away some strange spren like taut wires crossing before him,\nthen forced himself to do a set of push-ups. Keeping his strength up would\nbe difficult if the imprisonment continued too long. Perhaps he could ask\nfor some stones to use for training.\nWas this what happened to Moash’s grandparents? Kaladin wondered,\ntaking the food. Waiting for a trial until they died in prison?\nKaladin sat back on his bench, nibbling on the flatbread. There’d been a\nhighstorm yesterday, but he’d barely been able to hear it, locked away in\nthis room.\nHe heard Syl humming nearby, but couldn’t find where she’d gone.\n“Syl?” he asked. She kept hiding from him.\n“There was a Cryptic at the fight,” her voice said softly.\n“You mentioned those before, didn’t you? A type of spren?”\n“A revolting type.” She paused. “But not evil, I don’t think.” She\nsounded begrudging. “I was going to follow it, as it fled, but you needed\nme. When I went back to look, it had hidden from me.”\n“What does it mean?” Kaladin asked, frowning.\n“Cryptics like to plan,” Syl said slowly, as if recalling something long\nlost. “Yes… I remember. They debate and watch and never do anything.\nBut…”\n“What?” Kaladin asked, rising.\n“They’re looking for someone,” Syl said. “I’ve seen the signs. Soon,\nyou might not be alone, Kaladin.”\nLooking for someone. To choose, like him, as a Surgebinder. What kind\nof Knight Radiant had been made by a group of spren Syl so obviously\ndetested? It didn’t seem like someone he’d want to get to know.\nOh, storms, Kaladin thought, sitting back down. If they choose Adolin…\nThe thought should have made him sick. Instead, he found Syl’s\nrevelation oddly comforting. Not being alone, even if it did turn out to be\nAdolin, made him feel better and drove away some small measure of his\ngloom.\nAs he was finishing his meal, a thump came from the hallway. The door\nopening? Only lighteyes could visit him, though so far none had. Unless\nyou counted Wit.\nThe storm catches everyone, eventually…\nDalinar Kholin stepped into the room.\nDespite his sour thoughts, Kaladin’s immediate reaction—drilled into\nhim over the years—was to stand and salute, hand to breast. This was his\ncommanding officer. He felt an idiot as soon as he did it. He stood behind\nbars and saluted the man who’d put him here?\n“At ease,” Dalinar said with a nod.

Something about Dalinar was\nimposing, even when he was relaxed.\nHe looks like the generals from the stories, Kaladin thought. Thick of\nface and greying of hair, solid in the same way that a brick was. He didn’t\nwear a uniform, the uniform wore him. Dalinar Kholin represented an ideal\nthat Kaladin had long since decided was a mere fancy.\n“How are your accommodations?” Dalinar asked.\n“Sir? I’m in storming prison.”\nA smile cracked Dalinar’s face. “So I see. Calm yourself, soldier. If I’d\nordered you to guard a room for a week, would you have done it?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then consider this your duty. Guard this room.”\n“I’ll make sure nobody unauthorized runs off with the chamber pot, sir.”\n“Elhokar is coming around. He’s finished cooling off, and now only\nworries that releasing you too quickly will make him look weak. I’ll need\nyou to stay here a few more days, then we’ll draft a formal pardon for your\ncrime and have you reinstated to your position.”\n“I don’t see that I have any choice, sir.”\nDalinar stepped closer to the bars. “This is hard for you.”\nKaladin nodded.\n“You are well cared for, as are your men. Two of your bridgemen guard\nthe way into the building at all times. There is nothing to worry you, soldier.\nIf it’s your reputation with me—”\n“Sir,” Kaladin said. “I guess I’m just not convinced that the king will\never let me go. He has a history of letting inconvenient people rot in\ndungeons until they die.”\nAs soon as he said the words, Kaladin couldn’t believe they’d come\nfrom his lips. They sounded insubordinate, even treasonous. But they’d\nbeen sitting there, in his mouth, demanding to be spoken.\nDalinar remained in his posture with hands clasped behind his back.\n“You speak of the silversmiths back in Kholinar?”\nSo he did know. Stormfather… had Dalinar been involved? Kaladin\nnodded.\n“How did you hear of that incident?”\n“From one of my men,” Kaladin said. “He knew the imprisoned\npeople.”\n“I had hoped we could escape those rumors,” Dalinar said. “But of\ncourse, rumor grows like lichen, crusted on and impossible to completely\nscrub free. What happened with those people was a mistake, soldier. I’ll\nadmit that freely. The same won’t happen to you.”\n“Are the rumors about them true, then?”\n“I would really rather not speak of the Roshone affair.”\nRoshone.\nKaladin remembered screams. Blood on the floor of his father’s surgery\nroom. A dying boy.\nA day in the rain. A day when one man tried to steal away Kaladin’s\nlight. He eventually succeeded.\n“Roshone?” Kaladin whispered.\n“Yes, a minor lighteyes,” Dalinar said, sighing.\n“Sir, it’s important that I know of this. For my own peace of mind.”\nDalinar looked him up and down. Kaladin just stared straight ahead,"

Everything had started to go wrong when Roshone\nhad arrived in Hearthstone to be the new citylord. Before then, Kaladin’s\nfather had been respected.\nWhen that horrid man had arrived, dragging petty jealousy behind him\nlike a cloak, the world had twisted upon itself. Roshone had infected\nHearthstone like rotspren on an unclean wound. He was the reason Tien had\ngone to war. He was the reason Kaladin had followed.\n“I suppose I owe you this,” Dalinar said. “But it is not to be spread\naround. Roshone was a petty man who gained Elhokar’s ear. Elhokar was\ncrown prince then, commanded to rule over Kholinar and watch the\nkingdom while his father organized our first camps here in the Shattered\nPlains. I was… away at the time.\n“Anyway, do not blame Elhokar. He was taking the advice of someone\nhe trusted. Roshone, however, sought his own interests instead of those of\nthe Throne. He owned several silversmith shops… well, the details are not\nimportant. Suffice it to say that Roshone led the prince to make some errors.\nI cleared it up when I returned.”\n“You saw this Roshone punished?” Kaladin asked, voice soft, feeling\nnumb.\n“Exiled,” Dalinar said, nodding. “Elhokar moved the man to a place\nwhere he couldn’t do any more harm.”\nA place he couldn’t do any more harm. Kaladin almost laughed.\n“You have something to say?”\n“You don’t want to know what I think, sir.”\n“Perhaps I don’t. I probably need to hear it anyway.”\nDalinar was a good man. Blinded in some ways, but a good man. “Well,\nsir,” Kaladin said, controlling his emotions with difficulty, “I find it…\ntroubling that a man like this Roshone could be responsible for the deaths of\ninnocent people, yet escape prison.”\n“It was complicated, soldier. Roshone was one of Highprince Sadeas’s\nsworn liegemen, cousin to important men whose support we needed. I\noriginally argued that Roshone should be stripped of station and made a\ntenner, forced to live his life in squalor. But this would have alienated allies,\nand could have undermined the kingdom. Elhokar argued for leniency\ntoward Roshone, and his father agreed via spanreed. I relented, figuring that\nmercy was not an attribute I should discourage in Elhokar.”\n“Of course not,” Kaladin said, clenching his teeth. “Though it seems\nthat such mercy often ends up serving the cousins of powerful lighteyes,\nand rarely someone lowly.” He stared through the bars between himself and\nDalinar.\n“Soldier,” Dalinar asked, voice cool. “Do you think I’ve been unfair\ntoward you or your men?”\n“You. No, sir. But this isn’t about you.”\nDalinar exhaled softly, as if in frustration. “Captain, you and your men"

        "text": "toward you or your men?”\n“You. No, sir. But this isn’t about you.”\nDalinar exhaled softly, as if in frustration. “Captain, you and your men\nare in a unique position. You spend your daily lives around the king. You\ndon’t see the face that is presented to the world, you see the man. It has ever\nbeen so for close bodyguards.\n“So your loyalty needs to be extra firm and generous. Yes, the man you\nguard has flaws. Every man does. He is still your king, and I will have your\nrespect.”\n“I can and do respect the Throne, sir,” Kaladin said. Not the man sitting\nin it, perhaps. But he did respect the office. Somebody needed to rule.\n“Son,” Dalinar said after a moment’s thought, “do you know why I put\nyou into the position that I did?”\n“You said it was because you needed someone you could trust not to be\na spy for Sadeas.”\n“That’s the rationale,” Dalinar said, stepping up closer to the bars, only\ninches from Kaladin. “But it’s not the reason. I did it because it felt right.”\nKaladin frowned.\n“I trust my hunches,” Dalinar said. “My gut said you were a man who\ncould help change this kingdom. A man who could live through Damnation\nitself in Sadeas’s camp and still somehow inspire others was a man I wanted\nunder my command.” His expression grew harder. “I gave you a position no\ndarkeyes has ever held in this army. I let you into conferences with the king,\nand I listened when you spoke. Do not make me regret those decisions,\nsoldier.”\n“You don’t already?” Kaladin asked.\n“I’ve come close,” Dalinar said. “I understand, though. If you truly\nbelieve what you told me about Amaram… well, if I’d been in your place,\nI’d have been hard pressed not to do the same thing you did. But storm it,\nman, you’re still a darkeyes.”\n“It shouldn’t matter.”\n“Maybe it shouldn’t, but it does. You want to change that? Well, you’re\nnot going to do it by screaming like a lunatic and challenging men like\nAmaram to duels. You’ll do it by distinguishing yourself in the position I\ngave you. Be the kind of man that others admire, whether they be lighteyed\nor dark. Convince Elhokar that a darkeyes can lead. That will change the\nworld.”\nDalinar turned and walked away. Kaladin couldn’t help thinking that the\nman’s shoulders seemed more bowed than when he’d entered.\nAfter Dalinar left, Kaladin sat back on his bench, letting out a long,\nannoyed breath. “Stay calm,” he whispered. “Do as you’re told, Kaladin.\nStay in your cage.”\n“He’s trying to help,” Syl said.\nKaladin glanced to the side. Where was she hiding? “You heard about\nRoshone.”\nSilence.\n“Yes,” Syl finally said, voice sounding small.\n“My family’s poverty,” Kaladin said, “the way the town ostracized us,\nTien being forced into the army, these things were all Roshone’s fault.\nElhokar sent him to us.”"

Dalinar tried his best, but he had an enormous\nblind spot regarding his nephew.\nIt was time someone stepped in and cut the ties binding Dalinar’s hands.\nFor the good of the kingdom, for the good of Dalinar Kholin himself, the\nking had to die.\nSome people—like a festering finger or a leg shattered beyond repair—\njust needed to be removed.\n63. A Burning World\nNow, look what you’ve made me say. You’ve\nalways been able to bring out the most extreme in\nme, old friend. And I do still name you a friend,\nfor all that you weary me.\nWhat are you doing? the spanreed wrote to Shallan.\nNothing much, she wrote back by spherelight, just working on Sebarial’s\nincome ledgers. She peeked out through the hole in her illusion, regarding\nthe street far below. People flowed through the city as if marching to some\nstrange rhythm. A dribble, then a burst, then back to a dribble. Rarely a\nconstant flow. What caused that?\nYou want to come visit? the pen wrote. This is getting really boring.\nSorry, she wrote back to Adolin, I really need to get this work done. It\nmight be nice to have a spanreed conversation to keep me company, though.\nPattern hummed softly beside her at the lie. Shallan had used an illusion\nto expand the size of the shed atop this tenement in Sebarial’s warcamp,\nproviding a hidden place to sit and watch the street below. Five hours of\nwaiting—comfortable enough, with the stool and spheres for light—had\nrevealed nothing. Nobody had approached the lone stone-barked tree\ngrowing beside the pathway.\nShe didn’t know the species. It was too old to have been planted there\nrecently; it must predate Sebarial’s arrival. The gnarled, sturdy bark made\nher think it was some variety of dendrolith, but the tree also had long fronds\nthat rose into the air like streamers, twisting and fluttering in the wind.\nThose were reminiscent of a dalewillow. She’d already done a sketch; she\nwould look it up in her books later.\nThe tree was used to people, and didn’t pull in its fronds as they passed\nit. If someone had approached carefully enough to avoid brushing the\nfronds, Shallan would have spotted them. If, instead, they’d moved quickly,\nthe fronds would have felt the vibrations and withdrawn—which she also\nwould have spotted. She was reasonably certain that if anyone had tried to\nfetch the item in the tree, she’d have known it, even if she’d been looking\naway for a moment.\nI suppose, the pen wrote, I can continue to keep you company.

Shoren\nisn’t doing anything else.\nShoren was the ardent who wrote for Adolin today, come to visit by\nAdolin’s order. The prince had pointedly noted that he was using an ardent,\nrather than one of his father’s scribes. Did he think she’d grow jealous if he\nused another woman for scribing duties?\nHe did seem surprised that she didn’t get jealous. Were the women of\nthe court so petty? Or was Shallan the odd one, too relaxed? His eyes did\nwander, and she had to admit that wasn’t something that pleased her. And\nthere was his reputation to consider. Adolin was said to have, in the past,\nchanged relationships as frequently as other men changed coats.\nPerhaps she should cling more firmly, but the thought of it nauseated\nher. Such behavior reminded her of Father, holding so tightly to everything\nthat he eventually broke it all.\nYes, she wrote back to Adolin, using the board set on a box beside her,\nI’m certain the good ardent has nothing at all better to do than transcribe\nnotes between two courting lighteyes.\nHe’s an ardent, Adolin sent. He likes to serve. It’s what they do.\nI thought, she wrote, that saving souls was what they did.\nHe’s tired of that, Adolin sent. He told me that he already saved three\nthis morning.\nShe smiled, checking on the tree—still no change. He did, did he? she\nwrote. Has them tucked away in his back pocket for safekeeping, I assume?\nNo, Father’s way was not right. If she wanted to keep Adolin, she had to\ntry something far more difficult than just clinging to him. She’d have to be\nso irresistible that he didn’t want to let go. Unfortunately, this was one area\nwhere neither Jasnah’s training nor Tyn’s would help. Jasnah had been\nindifferent toward men, while Tyn had not talked about keeping men, only\ndistracting them for a quick con.\nIs your father feeling better? she wrote.\nYes, actually. He’s been up and about since yesterday, looking as strong\nas ever.\nGood to hear, she wrote. The two continued exchanging idle comments,\nShallan watching the tree. Mraize’s note had instructed her to come at\nsunrise and search the hole in the tree trunk for her instructions. So she’d\ncome four hours early, while the sky was still dark, and sneaked up to the\ntop of this building to watch.\nApparently, she hadn’t come early enough. She’d really wanted to get a\nview of them placing the instructions. “I don’t like this,” Shallan said,\nwhispering to Pattern and ignoring the pen, which scribed Adolin’s next line\nto her. “Why didn’t Mraize just give me the instructions via spanreed? Why\nmake me come here?”\n“Mmm…” Pattern said from the floor beneath her.\nThe sun had long since risen. She needed to go get the instructions, but\nstill she hesitated, tapping her finger against the paper-covered board beside\nher.\n“They’re watching,” she realized.\n“What?” Pattern said.\n“They are doing exactly what I did. They are hiding somewhere, and\nwant to watch me pick up the instructions.”"

What does it accomplish?”\n“It gives them information,” Shallan said. “And that is the sort of thing\nthese people thrive upon.” She leaned to the side, peering out of her hole,\nwhich would appear from the outside as a gap between two of the bricks.\nShe didn’t think Mraize wanted her dead, despite the sickening incident\nwith the poor carriage driver. He’d given leave for the others around him to\nkill her, if they feared her, but that—like so much about Mraize—had been\na test. If you really are strong and clever enough to join us, that incident\nimplied, then you’ll avoid being assassinated by these people.\nThis was another test. How did she pass it in a way that didn’t leave\nanyone dead this time?\nThey’d be watching for her to come get her instructions, but there\nweren’t many good places to keep an eye on the tree. If she were Mraize\nand his people, where would she go to observe?\nShe felt silly thinking it. “Pattern,” she whispered, “go look in the\nwindows of this building that face the street. See if anyone is sitting in one\nof them, watching as we are.”\n“Very well,” he said, sliding out of her illusion.\nShe was suddenly conscious of the fact that Mraize’s people might be\nhiding somewhere very close, but shoved aside her nervousness, reading\nAdolin’s reply.\nGood news, by the way, the pen wrote. Father visited last night, and we\ntalked at length. He’s preparing his expedition out onto the Plains to fight\nthe Parshendi, once and for all. Part of getting ready involves some\nscouting missions in the coming days. I got him to agree to bring you out\nonto the plateaus during one of them.\nAnd we can find a chrysalis? Shallan asked.\nWell, the pen wrote, even if the Parshendi aren’t fighting over those\nanymore, Father doesn’t take risks. I can’t bring you on a run when there is\na chance they might come and contest us. But, I’ve been thinking we can\nprobably arrange the scouting mission so it passes by a plateau with a\nchrysalis a day or so after it was harvested.\nShallan frowned. A dead, harvested chrysalis? she wrote. I don’t know\nhow much that will tell me.\nWell, Adolin replied, it’s better than not seeing one at all, right? And\nyou did say you wanted the chance to cut one up. This is almost the same\nthing.\nHe was right. Besides, getting out onto the Plains was the real goal.\nLet’s do it. When?\nIn a few days.\n“Shallan!”\nShe jumped, but it was only Pattern, buzzing with excitement. “You\nwere right,” he said. “Mmmm. She watches below. Only one level down,\nsecond room.”\n“She?”\n“Mmm. The one with the mask.”\nShallan shivered. Now what? Go back to her rooms, then write to\nMraize and say that she didn’t appreciate being spied upon?"

Go back to her rooms, then write to\nMraize and say that she didn’t appreciate being spied upon?\nIt wouldn’t accomplish anything useful. Looking down at her pad of\npaper, she realized that her relationship with Mraize was similar to her\nrelationship with Adolin. In both cases, she couldn’t just do as expected.\nShe needed to excite, exceed.\nI’ll need to go, she wrote to Adolin. Sebarial is asking for me. It might\ntake me a while.\nShe clicked off the spanreed and tucked it and the board away in her\nsatchel. Not her usual one, but a rugged bag with a leather strap that went\nover her shoulder, like Veil would carry. Then, before she could lose her\nnerve, she ducked out of her illusory hiding place. She put her back to the\nwall of the shed, facing away from the street, then touched the side of the\nillusion and withdrew the Stormlight.\nThat made the illusory section of wall vanish, quickly breaking down\nand streaming into her hand. Hopefully, nobody had been looking at the\nshed at that moment. If they had been, though, they would probably just\nthink the change a trick of the eyes.\nNext, she knelt and used Stormlight to infuse Pattern and bind to him an\nimage of Veil from a drawing she’d done earlier. Shallan nodded for him to\nmove, and as he did, the image of Veil walked.\nShe looked good. A confident stride, a swishing coat, peaked hat\nshading her face against the sun. The illusion even blinked and turned her\nhead on occasion, as prescribed by the drawing sequence Shallan had done\nearlier.\nShe watched, hesitating. Was that actually how she looked while\nwearing Veil’s face and clothing? She didn’t feel nearly that poised, and the\nclothing always seemed exaggerated, even silly, to her. On this image, it\nlooked appropriate.\n“Go down,” Shallan whispered to Pattern, “and walk to the tree. Try to\napproach carefully, slowly, and buzz loudly to get the tree’s leaves to pull\nback. Stand at the trunk for a moment, as if retrieving the thing inside, then\nwalk to the alleyway between this building and the next.”\n“Yes!” Pattern said. He zipped off toward the stairs, excited to be part of\nthe lie.\n“Slower!” Shallan said, wincing to see Veil’s pace not matching her\nspeed. “As we practiced!”\nPattern slowed and reached the steps. Veil’s image moved down them.\nAwkwardly. The illusion could walk and stand still on flat ground, but other\nterrain—such as steps—wasn’t accommodated. To anyone watching, it\nwould seem like Veil was stepping on nothing and gliding down the stairs.\nWell, it was the best they could do for the moment. Shallan took a deep\nbreath and pulled on her hat, breathing out a second image, one that covered\nher over and transformed her into Veil. The one on Pattern would remain so\nlong as he had Stormlight. That Stormlight drained from him a lot faster\nthan it did from Shallan, though. She didn’t know why."

The\nmasked woman passed Shallan’s hiding place, amazingly quiet as she\nmoved down the steps.\n“What is your name?” Shallan asked.\nThe woman froze on the steps. She spun—gloved safehand on the knife\nat her side—and saw Shallan standing in the alcove. The woman’s masked\neyes flicked back toward the room she’d left.\n“I sent a double,” Shallan said, “wearing my clothing. That’s what you\nsaw.”\nThe woman did not move, still crouched on the steps.\n“Why did he want you to follow me?” Shallan asked. “He’s that\ninterested in finding out where I’m staying?”\n“No,” the woman finally said. “The instructions in the tree call for you\nto set about a task immediately, with no time to waste.”\nShallan frowned, considering. “So your job wasn’t to follow me home,\nbut to follow me on the mission. To watch how I accomplished it?”\nThe woman said nothing.\nShallan strolled forward and seated herself on the top step, crossing her\narms on her legs. “So what is the job?”\n“The instructions are in—”\n“I’d rather hear it from you,” Shallan said. “Call me lazy.”\n“How did you find me?” the woman asked.\n“A sharp-eyed ally,” Shallan said. “I told him to watch the windows,\nthen send me word of where you were. I was waiting up above.” She\ngrimaced. “I was hoping to catch one of you placing the instructions.”\n“We placed them before even contacting you,” the woman said. She\nhesitated, then took a few steps upward. “Iyatil.”\nShallan cocked her head.\n“My name,” the woman said. “Iyatil.”\n“I’ve never heard one like it.”\n“Unsurprising. Your task today was to investigate a certain new arrival\ninto Dalinar’s camp. We wish to know about this person, and Dalinar’s\nallegiances are uncertain.”\n“He’s loyal to the king and the Throne.”\n“Outwardly,” the woman said. “His brother knew things of an\nextraordinary nature. We are uncertain if Dalinar was told of these things or\nnot, and his interactions with Amaram worry us. This newcomer is linked.”\n“Amaram is making maps of the Shattered Plains,” Shallan said. “Why?\nWhat is out there that he wants?” And why would he want to return the\nVoidbringers?\nIyatil didn’t answer.\n“Well,” Shallan said, rising, “let’s get to it, then. Shall we?”\n“Together?” Iyatil said.\nShallan shrugged. “You can sneak along behind, or you can just go with\nme.” She extended her hand."

She kept her other hand on the dagger at her side the entire\ntime, though.\n* * *\nShallan flipped through the instructions Mraize had left, as the\noversized palanquin lurched along toward Dalinar’s warcamp. Iyatil sat\nacross from Shallan, legs tucked beneath her, watching with beady, masked\neyes. The woman wore simple trousers and a shirt, such that Shallan had\noriginally mistaken her for a boy that first time.\nHer presence was thoroughly unsettling.\n“A madman,” Shallan said, flipping to the next page of instructions.\n“Mraize is this interested in a simple madman?”\n“Dalinar and the king are interested,” Iyatil said. “So, then, are we.”\nThere did seem to be some sort of cover-up involved. The madman had\narrived in the custody of a man named Bordin, a servant whom Dalinar had\nstationed in Kholinar years ago. Mraize’s information indicated that this\nBordin was no simple messenger, but instead one of Dalinar’s most trusted\nfootmen. He had been left behind in Alethkar to spy on the queen, or so the\nGhostbloods inferred. But why would someone need to keep an eye on the\nqueen? The briefing didn’t say.\nThis Bordin had come to the Shattered Plains in haste a few weeks ago,\nbearing the madman and other mysterious cargo. Shallan’s charge was to\nfind out who this madman was and why Dalinar had hidden him away in a\nmonastery with strict instructions that nobody was to be allowed access\nsave specific ardents.\n“Your master knows more about this,” Shallan said, “than he is telling\nme.”\n“My master?” Iyatil asked.\n“Mraize.”\nThe woman laughed. “You mistake. He is not my master. He is my\nstudent.”\n“In what?” Shallan asked.\nIyatil stared at her with a level gaze and gave no reply.\n“Why the mask?” Shallan asked, leaning forward. “What does it mean?\nWhy do you hide?”\n“I have many times asked myself,” Iyatil said, “why those of you here\ngo about so brazenly with features exposed to all who would see them. My\nmask reserves my self. Besides, it gives me the ability to adapt.”\nShallan sat back, thoughtful.\n“You are willing to ponder,” Iyatil said. “Rather than asking question\nafter question. This is good. Your instincts, however, must be judged. Are\nyou the hunter, or are you the quarry?”\n“Neither,” Shallan said immediately.\n“All are one or the other.”\nThe palanquin’s porters slowed. Shallan peeked out the curtains and\nfound that they had finally reached the edge of Dalinar’s warcamp. Here,\nsoldiers at the gates stopped each person in line waiting to enter.\n“How will you get us in?” Iyatil asked as Shallan closed the curtains.\n“Highprince Kholin has grown cautious of late, with assassins appearing in\nthe night. What lie will gain us access to his realm?”"

        "text": "“Highprince Kholin has grown cautious of late, with assassins appearing in\nthe night. What lie will gain us access to his realm?”\nDelightful, she thought, revising her list of tasks. Shallan not only had to\ninfiltrate the monastery and discover information about this madman, she\nhad to do it without revealing too much about herself—or what she could\ndo—to Iyatil.\nShe had to think quickly. The soldiers at the front called for the\npalanquin to approach—lighteyes wouldn’t be required to wait in the\nordinary line, and the soldiers would assume this nice a vehicle had\nsomeone rich inside. Taking a deep breath, Shallan removed her hat, pulled\nher hair forward over her shoulder, then pushed her face out of the curtains\nso that her hair hung down before her outside the palanquin. At the same\nmoment, she withdrew her illusion and pulled the curtains closed behind\nher head, tight against her neck, to prevent Iyatil from seeing the\ntransformation.\nThe porters were parshmen, and she doubted the parshmen would say\nanything about what they saw her do. Their lighteyed master was turned\naway, fortunately. Her palanquin wobbled up to the front of the line, and the\nguards started when they saw her. They waved her through immediately.\nThe face of Adolin’s betrothed was well known by this point.\nNow, how to get Veil’s appearance back on? There were people on the\nstreet here; she wasn’t about to breathe Stormlight while hanging out the\nwindow.\n“Pattern,” she whispered. “Go make a noise at the window on the other\nside of the palanquin.”\nTyn had drilled into her the need to make a distracting motion with one\nhand while palming an object with the other. The same principle might\nwork here.\nA sharp yelp sounded from the other window. Shallan moved her head\nback into the palanquin with a quick motion, breathing out Stormlight. She\nflipped the curtains in a diverting way and obscured her face with the hat as\nshe put it on.\nIyatil looked back toward her from the window where the yelp had\nsounded, but Shallan was Veil again. She settled back, meeting Iyatil’s gaze.\nHad the smaller woman seen?\nThey rode in silence for a moment.\n“You bribed the guards ahead of time,” Iyatil finally guessed. “I would\nknow how you did this. Kholin’s men are difficult to bribe. You got to one\nof the supervisors, perhaps?”\nShallan smiled in what she hoped was a frustrating way.\nThe palanquin continued on toward the warcamp’s temple, a part of\nDalinar’s camp that she’d never visited. Actually, she hadn’t been to visit\nSebarial’s ardents very often either—though when she had gone, she’d\nfound them surprisingly devout, considering who owned them.\nShe peeked out the window as they approached. Dalinar’s temple\ngrounds were as plain as she would have expected. Grey-robed ardents\npassed the palanquin in pairs or small groups, mixing among people of all\nstations. Those had come for prayers, instruction, or advice—a good\ntemple, properly equipped, could provide each of these things and more.\nDarkeyes from almost any nahn could come to be taught a trade, exercising"

Those had come for prayers, instruction, or advice—a good\ntemple, properly equipped, could provide each of these things and more.\nDarkeyes from almost any nahn could come to be taught a trade, exercising\ntheir divine Right to Learn, as mandated by the Heralds. Lesser lighteyes\ncame to learn trades as well, and the higher dahns came to learn the arts or\nprogress in their Callings to please the Almighty.\nA large population of ardents like this one would have true masters in\nevery art and trade. Perhaps she should come and seek Dalinar’s artists for\ntraining.\nShe winced, wondering where she would find time for such a thing.\nWhat with courting Adolin, infiltrating the Ghostbloods, researching the\nShattered Plains, and doing Sebarial’s ledgers, it was a wonder she had time\nto sleep. Still, it felt impious of her to expect success in her duties while\nignoring the Almighty. She did need to have more concern for such things.\nAnd what is the Almighty to think of you? she wondered. And the lies\nyou’re growing so proficient at producing. Honesty was among the divine\nattributes of the Almighty, after all, which everyone was supposed to seek.\nThe temple complex here included more than one building, though most\npeople would only visit the main structure. Mraize’s instructions had\nincluded a map, so she knew the specific building she needed—one near the\nback, where the ardent healers saw to the sick and cared for people with\nlong-term illnesses.\n“It will not be easy to enter,” Iyatil said. “The ardents are protective of\ntheir charges, and have them locked away in the back, kept from the eyes of\nother men. They will not welcome an attempt at intrusion.”\n“The instructions indicated that today was the perfect time to sneak in,”\nShallan said. “I was to make haste to not miss the opportunity.”\n“Once a month,” Iyatil said, “all may come to the temple to ask\nquestions or see a physician with no offering requested. Today will be a\nbusy day, a day of confusion. That will make for an easier time infiltrating,\nbut it does not mean they will simply let you saunter in.”\nShallan nodded.\n“If you would rather do this at night,” Iyatil said, “perhaps I can\npersuade Mraize that the matter can wait until then.”\nShallan shook her head. She had no experience sneaking about in the\ndarkness. She’d just make a fool of herself.\nBut how to get in…\n“Porter,” she commanded, sticking her head out the window and\npointing, “take us to that building there, then set us down. Send one of your\nnumber to seek the master healers. Tell them I need their aid.”\nThe tenner who led the parshmen—hired with Shallan’s spheres—\nnodded brusquely. Tenners were a strange lot. This one didn’t own the\nparshmen; he just worked for the woman who rented them out. Veil, with\ndark eyes, would be beneath him socially, but was also the one paying his\nwage, and so he just treated her as he would any other master.\nThe palanquin settled down and one of the parshmen walked off to\ndeliver her request.\n“Going to feign sickness?” Iyatil asked."

She\nclimbed out to meet a pair of square-bearded ardents, conferring as the\nparshmen led them in her direction. They looked her over, noting her dark\neyes and her clothing—which was well-made but obviously intended for\nrugged use. Likely, they placed her in one of the upper-middle nahns, a\ncitizen, but not a particularly important one.\n“What is the problem, young woman?” asked the older of the two\nardents.\n“It is my sister,” Shallan said. “She has put on this strange mask and\nrefuses to remove it.”\nA soft groan rose from inside the palanquin.\n“Child,” said the lead ardent, his tone suffering, “a stubborn sister is not\na matter for the ardents.”\n“I understand, good brother,” Shallan said, raising her hands before her.\n“But this is no simple stubbornness. I think… I think one of the\nVoidbringers has inhabited her!”\nShe pushed aside the curtains of the palanquin, revealing Iyatil inside.\nHer strange mask made the ardents pull back and break off their objections.\nThe younger of the two men peered in at Iyatil with wide eyes.\nIyatil turned to Shallan, and with an almost inaudible sigh, started\nrocking back and forth in place. “Should we kill them?” she muttered. “No.\nNo, we shouldn’t. But someone will see! No, do not say these things. No. I\nwill not listen to you.” She started humming.\nThe younger ardent turned to look back at the senior.\n“This is dire,” the ardent said, nodding. “Porter, come. Have your\nparshmen bring the palanquin.”\n* * *\nA short time later, Shallan waited in the corner of a small monastery\nroom, watching Iyatil sit and resist the ministration of several ardents. She\nkept warning them that if they removed her mask, she would have to kill\nthem.\nThat did not seem to be part of the act.\nFortunately, she otherwise played her part well. Her ravings, mixed with\nher hidden face, gave even Shallan shivers. The ardents seemed alternately\nfascinated and horrified.\nConcentrate on the drawing, Shallan thought to herself. It was a sketch\nof one of the ardents, a portly man about her own height. The drawing was\nrushed but capable. She idly found herself wondering what a beard would\nfeel like. Would it itch? But no, hair on your head didn’t itch, so why should\nhair on your face? How did they keep food out of the things?\nShe finished with a few quick marks, then rose quietly. Iyatil kept the\nardents’ attention with a new bout of raving. Shallan nodded to her in\nthanks, then slipped out of the door, entering the hallway. After glancing to\nthe sides to see that she was alone, she used a cloud of Stormlight to\ntransform into the ardent. That done, she reached up and tucked her straight\nred hair—the only part of her that threatened to pop out of the illusion—\ninside the back of her coat."

The sketch had been done at a\ndistance, and wasn’t terribly good. Hopefully…\n“Second hallway on the left,” Pattern said.\nShallan looked down at him, though her new costume—an ardent’s robe\n—obscured him where he sat on her coat. “How do you know?”\n“You were distracted by your drawing,” he said. “I peeked about. There\nis a very interesting woman four doors down. She appears to be rubbing\nexcrement on the wall.”\n“Ew.” Shallan thought she could smell it.\n“Patterns…” he said as they walked. “I did not get a good look at what\nshe was writing, but it seemed very interesting. I think I shall go and—”\n“No,” Shallan whispered, “stay with me.” She smiled, nodding to\nseveral ardents who strolled past. They didn’t speak to her, fortunately,\nmerely nodding back.\nThe monastery building, like most everything in Dalinar’s warcamp,\nwas sliced through with dull, unornamented hallways. Shallan followed\nPattern’s instructions to a thick door set into the stone. The lock clicked\nopen with Pattern’s help, and Shallan quietly slipped inside.\nA single small window—more of a slit—proved insufficient to fully\nilluminate the large figure sitting on the bed. Dark-skinned, like a man from\nthe Makabaki kingdoms, he had dark, ragged hair and hulking arms. Those\nwere the arms of either a laborer or a soldier. The man sat slumped, back\nbowed, head down, frail light from the window cutting a slice across his\nback in white. It made for a grim, powerful silhouette.\nThe man was whispering. Shallan couldn’t make out the words. She\nshivered, her back to the door, and held up the sketch Mraize had given her.\nThis seemed to be the same person—at least, the skin color and stout build\nwere the same, though this man was far more muscled than the picture\nindicated. Storms… those hands of his looked as if they could crush her like\na cremling.\nThe man did not move. He did not look up, did not shift. He was like a\nboulder that had rolled to a stop here.\n“Why is it kept so dark in this room?” Pattern asked, perfectly cheerful.\nThe madman didn’t react to the comment, or even Shallan, as she\nstepped forward.\n“Modern theory for helping the mad suggests dim confines,” Shallan\nwhispered. “Too much light stimulates them, and can reduce the\neffectiveness of treatment.” That was what she remembered, at least. She\nhadn’t read much on this subject. The room was dark. That window\ncouldn’t be more than a few fingers wide.\nWhat was he whispering? Shallan cautiously continued forward. “Sir?”\nshe asked.

Would that startle the man?\nHe wasn’t looking, so she withdrew the illusion.\n“He doesn’t seem angry,” Pattern said. “But you call him mad.”\n“‘Mad’ has two definitions,” Shallan said. “One means to be angry. The\nother means broken in the head.”\n“Ah,” Pattern said, “like a spren who has lost his bond.”\n“Not exactly, I’d guess,” Shallan said, stepping up to the madman. “But\nsimilar.” She knelt down by the man, trying to figure out what he was\nsaying.\n“The time of the Return, the Desolation, is at hand,” he whispered. She\nwould have expected an Azish accent from him, considering the skin color,\nbut he spoke perfect Alethi. “We must prepare. You will have forgotten\nmuch, following the destruction of times past.”\nShe looked over at Pattern, lost in the shadows at the side of the room,\nthen back at the man. Light glinted off his dark brown eyes, two bright\npinpricks on an otherwise shadowed visage. That slumped posture seemed\nso morose. He whispered on, about bronze and steel, about preparations and\ntraining.\n“Who are you?” Shallan whispered.\n“Talenel’Elin. The one you call Stonesinew.”\nShe felt a chill. Then the madman continued, whispering the same\nthings he had before, repeated exactly. She couldn’t even be certain if his\ncomment had been a reply to her question, or just a part of his recitation. He\ndid not answer further questions.\nShallan stepped back, folding her arms, satchel over her shoulder.\n“Talenel,” Pattern said. “I know that name.”\n“Talenelat’Elin is the name of one of the Heralds,” Shallan said. “This is\nalmost the same.”\n“Ah.” Pattern paused. “Lie?”\n“Undoubtedly,” Shallan said. “It defies reason that Dalinar Kholin\nwould have one of the Heralds of the Almighty locked away in a temple’s\nback rooms. Many madmen think themselves someone else.”\nOf course, many said that Dalinar himself was mad. And he was trying\nto refound the Knights Radiant. Scooping up a madman who thought he\nwas one of the Heralds could be in line with that.\n“Madman,” Shallan said, “where do you come from?”\nHe continued ranting.\n“Do you know what Dalinar Kholin wishes of you?”\nMore ranting.\nShallan sighed, but knelt and wrote his exact words to deliver to Mraize.\nShe got the entire sequence down, and listened to it twice through to make\nsure he wasn’t going to say anything new. He didn’t say his supposed name\nthis time, though.

He lurched for her, moving\nwith incredible speed. As Shallan yelped in surprise, he grabbed her and\nshoved her out of her cloud of Stormlight. The image fell apart,\nevaporating, and the madman smashed her up against the wall, his eyes\nwide, his breathing ragged. He searched her face with frantic eyes, pupils\ndarting back and forth.\nShallan trembled, breath catching.\nTen heartbeats.\n“One of Ishar’s Knights,” the madman whispered.

Though Amaram was still a bastard, of\ncourse.\nTogether, Amaram and the Alethi darkeyes turned to the madman.\nShallan couldn’t make out much of their features in the mostly dark room.\n“I don’t know why you need to hear it for yourself, Brightlord,” the servant\nsaid. “I told you what he said.”\n“Hush, Bordin,” Amaram said, crossing the room. “Listen at the door.”\nShallan stood stiff, pressed back in the corner. They’d see her, wouldn’t\nthey?\nAmaram knelt beside the bed. “Great Prince,” he whispered, hand to the\nmadman’s shoulder. “Turn. Let me see you.”\nThe madman looked up, still muttering.\n“Ah…” Amaram said, breathing out. “Almighty above, ten names, all\ntrue. You are beautiful. Gavilar, we have done it. We have finally done it.”\n“Brightlord?” Bordin said from the door. “I don’t like being here. If\nwe’re discovered, people might ask questions. The treasure…”\n“He truly spoke of Shardblades?”\n“Yes,” Bordin said. “A whole cache of them.”\n“The Honorblades,” Amaram whispered. “Great Prince, please, give me\nthe same words you spoke to this one.”\nThe madman muttered on, the same as Shallan had heard. Amaram\ncontinued kneeling, but eventually he turned toward the nervous Bordin.\n“Well?”\n“He repeated those words every day,” Bordin said, “but he only spoke\nof the Blades once.”\n“I would hear of them for myself.”\n“Brightlord… We could wait here days and not hear those words.\nPlease. We must go. The ardents will eventually come by on their rounds.”\nAmaram stood up with obvious reluctance. “Great Prince,” he said to\nthe huddled figure of the madman, “I go to recover your treasures. Speak"

I will put the Blades to good use.” He turned to\nBordin. “Come. Let us search out this place.”\n“Today?”\n“You said it was close.”\n“Yes, well, that was why I brought him all the way out here. But—”\n“If he accidentally speaks of this to others, I would have them go to the\nplace and find it empty of treasures. Come, quickly. You will be rewarded.”\nAmaram strode out. Bordin lingered at the door, looking at the madman,\nthen trailed out and shut the door with a click.\nShallan breathed out a long, deep breath, slumping down to the floor.\n“It’s like that sea of spheres.”\n“Shallan?” Pattern asked.\n“I’ve fallen in,” she said, “and it isn’t that the water is over my head—\nit’s that the stuff isn’t even water, and I have no idea how to swim in it.”\n“I do not understand this lie,” Pattern said.\nShe shook her head, the color bleeding back into her skin and clothing.\nShe made herself look like Veil again, then walked to the door,\naccompanied by the sound of the madman’s rambling. Herald of War. The\ntime of the Return is near at hand…\nOutside, she found her way back to the room with Iyatil, then\napologized profusely to the ardents there who were looking for her. She\npled that she had gotten lost, but said she’d accept an escort to take her back\nto her palanquin.\nBefore going, however, she leaned down to hug Iyatil, as if to wish her\nsister farewell.\n“You can escape?” Shallan whispered.\n“Don’t be stupid. Of course I can.”\n“Take this,” Shallan said, pressing a sheet of paper into Iyatil’s gloved\nfreehand. “I wrote upon it the ramblings of the madman. They repeat\nwithout change. I saw Amaram sneak into the room; he seems to think these\nwords are authentic, and he seeks a treasure the madman spoke of earlier. I\nwill write a thorough report via spanreed to you and the others tonight.”\nShallan moved to pull back, but Iyatil held on. “Who are you really,\nVeil?” the woman asked. “You caught me in stealth spying upon you, and\nyou can lose me in the streets. This is not easily accomplished. Your clever\ndrawings fascinate Mraize, another near-impossible task, considering all\nthat he has seen. Now what you have done today.”\nShallan felt a thrill. Why should she feel so excited to have the respect\nof these people? They were murderers.\nBut storms take her, she had earned that respect.\n“I seek the truth,” Shallan said. “Wherever it may be, whoever may hold\nit. That’s who I am.” She nodded to Iyatil, then pulled away and escaped the\nmonastery.\nLater on that night, after sending in a full report of the day’s events—as\nwell as promising drawings of the madman, Amaram, and Bordin for good\nmeasure—she received back a simple message from Mraize."

But you have proven\nyourself. You no longer need fear our other members; they have been\ninstructed not to touch you. You are required to get a specific tattoo, a\nsymbol of your loyalty. I will send a drawing. You may add it to your person\nwherever you wish, but must prove it to me when we next meet.\nWelcome to the Ghostbloods.\nLife Cycle of a Chull\n65. The One Who Deserves It\nONE AND A HALF YEARS AGO\nWhat is a woman’s place in this modern world? Jasnah Kholin’s words\nread. I rebel against this question, though so many of my peers ask it. The\ninherent bias in the inquiry seems invisible to so many of them. They\nconsider themselves progressive because they are willing to challenge many\nof the assumptions of the past.\nThey ignore the greater assumption—that a “place” for women must be\ndefined and set forth to begin with. Half of the population must somehow be\nreduced to the role arrived at by a single conversation. No matter how\nbroad that role is, it will be—by nature—a reduction from the infinite\nvariety that is womanhood.\nI say that there is no role for women—there is, instead, a role for each\nwoman, and she must make it for herself. For some, it will be the role of\nscholar; for others, it will be the role of wife. For others, it will be both. For\nyet others, it will be neither.\nDo not mistake me in assuming I value one woman’s role above another.\nMy point is not to stratify our society—we have done that far too well\nalready—my point is to diversify our discourse.\nA woman’s strength should not be in her role, whatever she chooses it to\nbe, but in the power to choose that role. It is amazing to me that I even have\nto make this point, as I see it as the very foundation of our conversation.\nShallan closed the book. Not two hours had passed since Father had\nordered Helaran’s assassination. After Shallan had retreated to her room, a\npair of Father’s guards had appeared in the hallway outside. Probably not to\nwatch her—she doubted that Father knew that she’d overheard his order for\nHelaran to be killed. The guards were to see that Malise, Shallan’s\nstepmother, did not try to flee.\nThat could be a mistaken assumption. Shallan didn’t even know if\nMalise was still alive, following her screaming and Father’s cold, angry\nranting.\nShallan wanted to hide, to hunker down in her closet with blankets\nwrapped around her, eyes squeezed shut. The words in Jasnah Kholin’s\nbook strengthened her, though in some ways it seemed laughable for\nShallan to even be reading it. Highlady Kholin talked about the nobility of\nchoice, as if every woman had such opportunity. The decision between\nbeing a mother or a scholar seemed a difficult decision in Jasnah’s\nestimation. That wasn’t a difficult choice at all! That seemed like a grand"

That wasn’t a difficult choice at all! That seemed like a grand\nplace to be! Either would be delightful when compared to a life of fear in a\nhouse seething with anger, depression, and hopelessness.\nShe imagined what Highlady Kholin must be, a capable woman who did\nnot do as others insisted she must. A woman with power, authority. A\nwoman who had the luxury of seeking her dreams.\nWhat would that be like?\nShallan stood up. She walked to the door, then cracked it open. Though\nthe evening had grown late, the two guards still stood at the other end of the\nhallway. Shallan’s heart thumped, and she cursed her timidity. Why couldn’t\nshe be like women who acted, instead of being someone who hid in her\nroom with a pillow around her head?\nShaking, she slipped from the room. She padded toward the soldiers,\nfeeling their eyes on her. One raised his hand. She didn’t know the man’s\nname. Once, she’d known all of the guards’ names. Those men, whom she’d\ngrown up with, had been replaced now.\n“My father will need me,” she said, not stopping at the guard’s gesture.\nThough he was lighteyed, she did not need to obey him. She might spend\nmost of every day in her rooms, but she was still of a much higher rank than\nhe.\nShe walked by the men, trembling hands clenched tight. They let her go.\nWhen she passed her father’s door, she heard soft weeping inside. Malise\nstill lived, thankfully.\nShe found Father in the feast hall, sitting alone with both firepits\nroaring, full of flames. He slumped at the high table, lit by harsh light,\nstaring at the tabletop.\nShallan slipped into the kitchen before he noticed her, and mixed his\nfavorite. Deep violet wine, spiced with cinnamon and warmed against the\nchill day. He looked up as she walked back into the feast hall. She set the\ncup before him, looking into his eyes. No darkness there today. Just him.\nThat was very rare, these days.\n“They won’t listen, Shallan,” he whispered. “Nobody will listen. I hate\nthat I have to fight my own house. They should support me.” He took the\ndrink. “Wikim just stares at the wall half the time. Jushu is worthless, and\nBalat fights me every step. Now Malise too.”\n“I will speak to them,” Shallan said.\nHe drank the wine, then nodded. “Yes. Yes, that would be good. Balat is\nstill out with those cursed axehound corpses. I’m glad they’re dead. That\nlitter was full of runts. He didn’t need them anyway…”\nShallan stepped into the chill air. The sun had set, but lanterns hung on\nthe eaves of the manor house. She had rarely seen the gardens at night, and\nthey took on a mysterious cast in the darkness. Vines looked like fingers\nreaching from the void, seeking something to grab and pull away into the\nnight.\nBalat lay on one of the benches. Shallan’s feet crunched on something"

Claws from cremlings, pulled free of their bodies\none after another, then tossed to the ground. She shivered.\n“You should go,” she said to Balat.\nHe sat up. “What?”\n“Father can no longer control himself,” Shallan said softly. “You need to\nleave, while you can. I want you to take Malise with you.”\nBalat ran his hand through his mess of curly dark hair. “Malise? Father\nwill never let her go. He’d hunt us down.”\n“He’ll hunt you anyway,” Shallan said. “He hunts Helaran. Earlier\ntoday, he ordered one of his men to find our brother and assassinate him.”\n“What!” Balat stood. “That bastard! I’ll… I…” He looked to Shallan in\nthe darkness, face lit by starlight. Then he crumpled, sitting back down,\nholding his head in his hands. “I’m a coward, Shallan,” he whispered. “Oh,\nStormfather, I’m a coward. I won’t face him. I can’t.”\n“Go to Helaran,” Shallan said. “Could you find him, if you needed to?”\n“He… Yes, he left me the name of a contact in Valath who could put me\nin touch with him.”\n“Take Malise and Eylita. Go to Helaran.”\n“I won’t have time to find Helaran before Father catches up.”\n“Then we will contact Helaran,” Shallan said. “We will make plans for\nyou to meet him, and you can schedule your flight for a time when Father is\naway. He is planning another trip to Vedenar a few months from now. Leave\nwhen he’s gone, get a head start.”\nBalat nodded. “Yes… Yes, that is good.”\n“I will draft a letter to Helaran,” Shallan said. “We need to warn him\nabout Father’s assassins, and we can ask him to take the three of you in.”\n“You shouldn’t have to do this, small one,” Balat said, head down. “I’m\nthe eldest after Helaran. I should have been able to stop Father by now.\nSomehow.”\n“Take Malise away,” Shallan said. “That will be doing enough.”\nHe nodded.\nShallan returned to the house, passing Father mulling over his\ndisobedient family, and fetched some things from the kitchen. Then she\nreturned to the steps and looked upward. Taking a few deep breaths, she\nwent over what she would say to the guards if they stopped her. Then she\nraced up them and opened the door into her father’s sitting room.\n“Wait,” the hallway guard said. “He left orders. Nobody in or out.”\nShallan’s throat tightened, and even with her practice, she stammered as\nshe spoke. “I just talked to him. He wants me to speak with her.”\nThe guard inspected her, chewing on something. Shallan felt her\nconfidence wilt, heart racing. Confrontation.

He\neventually returned, nodding, and the first man reluctantly waved for her to\ncontinue. Shallan entered.\nInto the Place.\nShe had not entered this room in years. Not since…\nNot since…\nShe raised a hand, shading her eyes against the light coming from\nbehind the painting. How could Father sleep in here? How was it that\nnobody else looked, nobody else cared? That light was blinding.\nFortunately, Malise was curled in an easy chair facing that wall, so\nShallan could put her back to the painting and obstruct the light. She rested\na hand on her stepmother’s arm.\nShe didn’t feel that she knew Malise, despite years living together. Who\nwas this woman who would marry a man everyone whispered had killed his\nprevious wife? Malise oversaw Shallan’s education—meaning she searched\nfor new tutors each time the women fled—but Malise herself couldn’t do\nmuch to teach Shallan. One could not teach what one did not know.\n“Mother?” Shallan asked. She used the word.\nMalise looked. Despite the blazing light of the room, Shallan saw the\nwoman’s lip was split and bleeding. She cradled her left arm. Yes, it was\nbroken.\nShallan took out the gauze and cloth she had fetched from the kitchen,\nthen began to wipe down the wounds. She would have to find something to\nuse as a splint for that arm.\n“Why doesn’t he hate you?” Malise said harshly. “He hates everyone\nelse but you.”\nShallan dabbed at the woman’s lip.\n“Stormfather, why did I come to this cursed household?” Malise\nshuddered. “He’ll kill us all. One by one, he’ll break us and kill us. There’s\na darkness inside of him. I’ve seen it, behind his eyes. A beast…”\n“You’re going to leave,” Shallan said softly.\nMalise barked a laugh. “He’ll never let me go. He never lets go of\nanything.”\n“You’re not going to ask,” Shallan whispered. “Balat is going to run and\njoin Helaran, who has powerful friends. He’s a Shardbearer. He’ll protect\nthe both of you.”\n“We’ll never reach him,” Malise said. “And if we do, why would\nHelaran take us in? We have nothing.”\n“Helaran is a good man.”\nMalise twisted in her seat, staring away from Shallan, who continued\nher ministrations. The woman whimpered when Shallan bound her arm, but\nwouldn’t respond to questions. Finally, Shallan gathered up the bloodied\ncloths to throw away.\n“If I go,” Malise whispered, “and Balat with me, who will he hate? Who\nwill he hit? Maybe you, finally? The one who actually deserves it?”\n“Maybe,” Shallan whispered, then left.\n66. Stormblessings\nIs not the destruction we have wrought\nenough?

Kaladin continued to lie motionless with closed\neyes, and did not look.\nIn order to keep the darkness at bay, he had begun planning. What\nwould he do when he got out? When he got out. He had to tell himself that\nforcibly. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Dalinar. His mind, though… his mind\nbetrayed him, and whispered things that were not true.\nDistortions. In his state, he could believe that Dalinar lied. He could\nbelieve that the highprince secretly wanted Kaladin in prison. Kaladin was a\nterrible guard, after all. He’d failed to do anything about the mysterious\ncountdowns scrawled on walls, and he’d failed to stop the Assassin in\nWhite.\nWith his mind whispering lies, Kaladin could believe that Bridge Four\nwas happy to be rid of him—that they pretended they wanted to be guards,\njust to make him happy. They secretly wanted to go on with their lives, lives\nthey’d enjoy, without Kaladin spoiling them.\nThese untruths should have seemed ridiculous to him. They didn’t.\nClink.\nKaladin snapped his eyes open, growing tense. Had they come to take\nhim, to execute him, as the king wished? He leaped to his feet, coming\ndown in a battle stance, the empty bowl from his meal held to throw.\nThe jailer at the cell door stepped back, eyes widening. “Storms, man,”\nhe said. “I thought you were asleep. Well, your time is served. King signed\na pardon today. They didn’t even strip your rank or position.” The man\nrubbed his chin, then pulled the cell door open. “Guess you’re lucky.”\nLucky. People always said that about Kaladin. Still, the prospect of\nfreedom forced away the darkness inside of him, and Kaladin approached\nthe door. Wary. He stepped out, the guard backing away.\n“You are a distrustful one, aren’t you?” the jailer said. A lighteyes of\nlow rank. “Guess that makes you a good bodyguard.” The man gestured for\nKaladin to leave the room first.\nKaladin waited.\nFinally, the guard sighed. “Right, then.” He walked out the doorway\ninto the hall beyond.\nKaladin followed, and with each step felt himself traveling back a few\ndays in time. Shut the darkness away. He wasn’t a slave. He was a soldier.\nCaptain Kaladin. He’d survived this… what had it been? Two, three weeks?\nThis short time back in a cage.\nHe was free now. He could return to his life as a bodyguard. But one\nthing… one thing had changed.\nNobody will ever, ever, do this to me again. Not king or general, not\nbrightlord or brightlady.\nHe would die first.\nThey passed a leeward window, and Kaladin stopped to breathe in the\ncool, fresh scent of open air.

Kaladin turned down the hallway to where the guard\nhad stopped at another cell—one of the larger ones set into the hallway\nitself. Kaladin had been put in the deepest cell, away from the windows.\nThe jailer twisted a key in the lock of the wooden door, then pulled it\nopen. Adolin Kholin—wearing a simple tight uniform—stepped out. He\nalso had several weeks of growth on his face, though the beard was blond,\nspeckled black. The princeling took a deep breath, then turned toward\nKaladin and nodded.\n“He locked you away?” Kaladin said, baffled. “How… ? What… ?”\nAdolin turned to the jailer. “Were my orders followed?”\n“They wait in the room just beyond, Brightlord,” the jailer said,\nsounding nervous.\nAdolin nodded, moving in that direction.\nKaladin reached the jailer, taking him by the arm. “What is happening?\nThe king put Dalinar’s heir in here?”\n“The king didn’t have anything to do with it,” the jailer said.\n“Brightlord Adolin insisted. So long as you were in here, he wouldn’t leave.\nWe tried to stop him, but the man’s a prince. We can’t storming make him\ndo anything, not even leave. He locked himself away in the cell and we just\nhad to live with it.”\nImpossible. Kaladin glanced at Adolin, who walked slowly down the\nhallway. The prince looked a lot better than Kaladin felt—Adolin had\nobviously seen a few baths, and his prison cell had been much larger, with\nmore privacy.\nIt had still been a cell.\nThat was the disturbance I heard, Kaladin thought, on that day, early\nafter I was imprisoned. Adolin came and shut himself in.\nKaladin jogged up to the man. “Why?”\n“Didn’t seem right, you in here,” Adolin said, eyes forward.\n“I ruined your chance to duel Sadeas.”\n“I’d be crippled or dead without you,” Adolin said. “So I wouldn’t have\nhad the chance to fight Sadeas anyway.” The prince stopped in the hallway,\nand looked at Kaladin. “Besides. You saved Renarin.”\n“It’s my job,” Kaladin said.\n“Then we need to pay you more, bridgeboy,” Adolin said. “Because I\ndon’t know if I’ve ever met another man who would jump, unarmored, into\na fight among six Shardbearers.”\nKaladin frowned. “Wait. Are you wearing cologne? In prison?”\n“Well, there was no need to be barbaric, just because I was\nincarcerated.”\n“Storms, you’re spoiled,” Kaladin said, smiling.\n“I’m refined, you insolent farmer,” Adolin said. Then he grinned.\n“Besides, I’ll have you know that I had to use cold water for my baths while\nhere.”\n“Poor boy.”\n“I know.” Adolin hesitated, then held out a hand."

You think he\ncouldn’t have simply ignored your request and proceeded, letting me\nexpand on my challenge to Sadeas? He threw a tantrum instead of taking\ncontrol of the crowd and pushing forward. Storming man.”\nKaladin blinked at the audacious tone, then glanced toward the jailer,\nwho stood a distance behind, obviously trying to look inconspicuous.\n“The things you said about Amaram,” Adolin said. “Were they true?”\n“Every one.”\nAdolin nodded. “I’ve always wondered what that man was hiding.” He\ncontinued walking.\n“Wait,” Kaladin said, jogging to catch up, “you believe me?”\n“My father,” Adolin said, “is the best man I know, perhaps the best man\nalive. Even he loses his temper, makes bad judgment calls, and has a\ntroubled past. Amaram never seems to do anything wrong. If you listen to\nthe stories about him, it’s like everyone expects him to glow in the dark and\npiss nectar. That stinks, to me, of someone who works too hard to maintain\nhis reputation.”\n“Your father says I shouldn’t have tried to duel him.”\n“Yeah,” Adolin said, reaching the door at the end of the hallway.\n“Dueling is formalized in a way I suspect you just don’t get. A darkeyes\ncan’t challenge a man like Amaram, and you certainly shouldn’t have done\nit like you did. It embarrassed the king, like spitting on a gift he’d given\nyou.” Adolin hesitated. “Of course, that shouldn’t matter to you anymore.\nNot after today.”\nAdolin pushed open the door. Beyond, most of the men of Bridge Four\ncrowded into a small room where the jailers obviously spent their days. A\ntable and chairs had been shoved to the corner to make room for the twenty-\nsomething men who saluted Kaladin as the door opened. Their salutes\ndissolved immediately as they started to cheer.\nThat sound… that sound quashed the darkness until it vanished\ncompletely. Kaladin found himself smiling as he stepped out to meet them,\ntaking hands, listening to Rock make a wisecrack about his beard. Renarin\nwas there in his Bridge Four uniform, and he immediately joined his\nbrother, speaking to him quietly in a jovial way, though he had out his little\nbox that he liked to fidget with.\nKaladin glanced to the side. Who were those men beside the wall?\nMembers of Adolin’s retinue. Was that one of Adolin’s armorers? They\ncarried some items draped with sheets. Adolin stepped into the room and\nloudly clapped his hands, quieting Bridge Four.\n“It turns out,” Adolin said, “that I’m in possession of not one, but two\nnew Shardblades and three sets of Plate.

If a darkeyes bonds a\nShardblade, will his eyes change color?”\nKaladin felt a moment of sheer panic. Again. It was happening again.\nThe armorers removed the sheets, revealing a shimmering silvery Blade.\nEdged on both sides, a pattern of twisting vines ran up its center. At their\nfeet, the armorers uncovered a set of Plate, painted orange, taken from one\nof the men Kaladin had helped defeat.\nTake these Shards, and everything changed. Kaladin immediately felt\nsick, almost cripplingly so. He turned back to Adolin. “I can do with these\nas I wish?”\n“Take them,” Adolin said, nodding. “They are yours.”\n“Not anymore,” Kaladin said, pointing toward one of the members of\nBridge Four. “Moash. Take these. You’re now a Shardbearer.”\nAll of the color drained from Moash’s face. Kaladin prepared himself.\nLast time… He flinched as Adolin grabbed him by the shoulder, but the\ntragedy of Amaram’s army did not repeat. Instead, Adolin yanked Kaladin\nback into the hallway, holding up a hand to stop the bridgemen from\ntalking.\n“Just a second,” Adolin said. “Nobody move.” Then, in a quieter voice,\nhe hissed to Kaladin. “I’m giving you a Shardblade and Shardplate.”\n“Thank you,” Kaladin said. “Moash will use them well. He’s been\ntraining with Zahel.”\n“I didn’t give them to him. I gave them to you.”\n“If they’re really mine, then I can do with them as I wish. Or are they\nnot really mine?”\n“What’s wrong with you?” Adolin said. “This is the dream of every\nsoldier, darkeyed or light. Is this out of spite? Or… is it…” Adolin seemed\ncompletely baffled.\n“It’s not out of spite,” Kaladin said, speaking softly. “Adolin, those\nBlades have killed too many people I love. I can’t look at them, can’t touch\nthem, without seeing blood.”\n“You’d be lighteyed,” Adolin whispered. “Even if it didn’t change your\neye color, you’d count as one. Shardbearers are immediately of the fourth\ndahn. You could challenge Amaram. Your whole life would change.”\n“I don’t want my life to change because I’ve become a lighteyes,”\nKaladin said. “I want the lives of people like me… like I am now… to\nchange. This gift is not for me, Adolin. I’m not trying to spite you or anyone"

I just don’t want a Shardblade.”\n“That assassin is going to come back,” Adolin said. “We both know it.\nI’d rather have you there with Shards to back me up.”\n“I’ll be more useful without them.”\nAdolin frowned.\n“Let me give the Shards to Moash,” Kaladin said. “You saw, on that\nfield, that I can handle myself fine without a Blade and Plate. If we Shard-\nup one of my best men, there will be three of us to fight him, not just two.”\nAdolin looked into the room, then skeptically back at Kaladin. “You are\ncrazy, you realize.”\n“I’ll accept that.”\n“Fine,” Adolin said, striding back into the room. “You. Moash, was it? I\nguess those Shards are yours, now. Congratulations. You now outrank\nninety percent of Alethkar. Pick yourself a family name and ask to join one\nof the houses under Dalinar’s banner, or start your own if you are inclined.”\nMoash glanced at Kaladin for confirmation. Kaladin nodded.\nThe tall bridgeman walked to the side of the room, reaching out a hand\nto rest his fingers on the Shardblade. He ran those fingers all the way down\nto the hilt, then seized it, lifting the Blade in awe. Like most, it was\nenormous, but Moash held it easily in one hand. The heliodor set into the\npommel flashed with a burst of light.\nMoash looked to the others of Bridge Four, a sea of wide eyes and\nspeechless mouths. Gloryspren rose around him, a spinning mass of at least\ntwo dozen spheres of light.\n“His eyes,” Lopen said. “Shouldn’t they be changing?”\n“If it happens,” Adolin said, “it might not be until he’s bonded the thing.\nThat takes a week.”\n“Put the Plate on me,” Moash said to the armorers. Urgent, as if he\nfeared it would be taken from him.\n“Enough of this!” Rock said as the armorers began to work, his voice\nfilling the room like captive thunder. “We have party to give! Great Captain\nKaladin, Stormblessed and dweller in prisons, you will come eat my stew\nnow. Ha! I have been cooking it as long as you were locked away.”\nKaladin let the bridgemen usher him out into the sunlight, where a\ncrowd of soldiers waited—including many of the bridgemen from other\ncrews. These cheered, and Kaladin caught sight of Dalinar waiting off to the\nside. Adolin moved to join his father, but Dalinar watched Kaladin. What\ndid that look mean? So pensive. Kaladin looked away, accepting the\ngreetings of bridgemen as they clasped his hand and clapped him on the\nback.\n“What did you say, Rock?” Kaladin said. “You cooked a stew for each\nday I was locked in prison?”\n“No,” Teft said, scratching his beard. “The storming Horneater has been"

He won’t let us try it,\nand insists on getting up at night and tending it.”\n“Is celebratory stew,” Rock said, folding his arms. “Must simmer long\ntime.”\n“Well, let’s get to it, then,” Kaladin said. “I could certainly use\nsomething better than prison food.”\nThe men cheered, piling off toward their barrack. As they moved,\nKaladin grabbed Teft by the arm. “How did the men take it?” he asked. “My\nimprisonment?”\n“There was talk of breaking you out,” Teft admitted softly. “I beat some\nsense into them. Ain’t no good soldier who hasn’t spent a day or two locked\nup. It’s part of the job. They didn’t demote you, so they just wanted to slap\nyour wrist a little. The men saw the truth of it.”\nKaladin nodded.\nTeft glanced at the others. “There’s quite a lot of anger among them\nabout this Amaram fellow. And a lot of interest. Anything about your past\ngets them talking, you know.”\n“Lead them back to the barrack,” Kaladin said. “I’ll join you in a\nmoment.”\n“Don’t take too long,” Teft said. “The lads have been guarding this\ndoorway for three weeks now. You owe them their celebration.”\n“I’ll be along,” Kaladin said. “I just want to say a few things to Moash.”\nTeft nodded and jogged off to wrangle the others. The prison’s front\nroom felt empty when Kaladin walked back in. Only Moash and the\narmorers remained. Kaladin walked up to them, watching Moash make a\nfist with his gauntlet.\n“I’m still having trouble believing this, Kal,” Moash said as the\narmorers fit on his breastplate. “Storms… I’m now worth more than some\nkingdoms.”\n“I wouldn’t suggest selling the Shards, at least not to a foreigner,”\nKaladin said. “That sort of thing can be considered treason.”\n“Sell?” Moash said, looking up sharply. He made another fist. “Never.”\nHe smiled, a grin of pure joy as the breastplate locked into place.\n“I’ll help him with the rest,” Kaladin said to the armorers. They\nwithdrew reluctantly, leaving Kaladin and Moash alone.\nHe helped Moash fit one of the pauldrons to his shoulder. “I had a lot of\ntime to think, in there,” Kaladin said.\n“I can imagine.”\n“The time led me to a few decisions,” Kaladin said as the section of\nPlate locked into place. “One is that your friends are right.”\nMoash turned to him sharply. “So…”\n“So tell them I agree with their plan,” Kaladin said. “I’ll do what they\nwant me to in order to help them… accomplish their task.”\nThe room grew strangely still.\nMoash took him by the arm. “I told them you’d see.” He gestured to the\nPlate he wore. “This will help too, with what we must do.

And once we’ve\nfinished, I think a certain man you challenged might need the same\ntreatment.”\n“I only agree,” Kaladin said, “because it’s for the best. For you, Moash,\nthis is about revenge—and don’t try to deny it. I really think it is what\nAlethkar needs. Maybe what the world needs.”\n“Oh, I know,” Moash said, putting on the helmet, visor up. He took a\ndeep breath, then took a step and stumbled, nearly crashing to the ground.\nHe steadied himself by grabbing a table, which he crunched beneath his\nfingers, the wood splitting.\nHe stared at what he’d done, then laughed. “This… this is going to\nchange everything. Thank you, Kaladin. Thank you.”\n“Let’s get those armorers and help you take it off,” Kaladin said.\n“No. You go to Rock’s storming feast. I’m going to the sparring grounds\nto practice! I won’t take this off until I can move in it naturally.”\nHaving seen how much work Renarin was putting into learning his\nPlate, Kaladin suspected that might take longer than Moash wanted. He\ndidn’t say anything, instead stepping back out into the sunlight. He enjoyed\nthat for a moment, eyes closed, head toward the sky.\nThen, he jogged off to rejoin Bridge Four.\n67. Spit and Bile\nMy path has been chosen very deliberately.\nYes, I agree with everything you have said about\nRayse, including the severe danger he presents.\nDalinar stopped on the switchbacks down from the Pinnacle, Navani at\nhis side. In the waning light, they watched a river of men flowing back into\nthe warcamps from the Shattered Plains. The armies of Bethab and\nThanadal were returning from their plateau run, following their highprinces,\nwho had probably gotten back somewhat earlier.\nDown below, a rider approached the Pinnacle, likely with news for the\nking on the runs. Dalinar looked to one of his guards—he had four tonight,\ntwo for him, two for Navani—and gestured.\n“You want the details, Brightlord?” asked the bridgeman.\n“Please.”\nThe man jogged off down the switchbacks. Dalinar watched him go,\nthoughtful. These men were remarkably disciplined, considering their origin\n—but they were not career soldiers. They did not like what he had done in\nthrowing their captain into prison.\nHe suspected they wouldn’t let it become a problem. Captain Kaladin\nled them well—he was the exact type of officer Dalinar looked for. The\nkind that showed initiative not because of a desire for advancement, but\nbecause of the satisfaction of a job well done. Those kinds of soldiers often\nhad rocky starts until they learned to keep their heads. Storms. Dalinar\nhimself had needed similar lessons pounded into him at various points in\nhis life.\nHe continued with Navani down the switchbacks, walking slowly. She\nlooked radiant tonight, hair done with sapphires that glowed softly in the\nlight. Navani liked these strolls together, and they were in no hurry to arrive\nat the feast."

Navani liked these strolls together, and they were in no hurry to arrive\nat the feast.\n“I keep thinking,” Navani said, continuing their previous conversation,\n“that there should be a way to use fabrials as pumps. You have seen the\ngemstones built to attract certain substances, but not others—it is most\nuseful with something like smoke above a fire. Could we make this work\nwith water?”\nDalinar grunted, nodding.\n“More and more buildings in the warcamps are plumbed,” she\ncontinued, “after the Kharbranthian manner—but those use gravity itself as\na way to conduct the liquid through their piping. I imagine true motion,\nwith gemstones at the ends of piping segments to pull water through at a\nflow, against the pull of the earth…”\nHe grunted again.\n“We made a breakthrough in the design of new Shardblades the other\nday.”\n“What, really?” he asked. “What happened? How soon will you have\none ready?”\nShe smiled, arm around his.\n“What?”\n“Just seeing if you are still you,” she said. “Our breakthrough was\nrealizing that the gemstones in the Blades—used to bond them—might not\nhave originally been part of the weapons.”\nHe frowned. “That’s important?”\n“Yes. If this is true, it means the Blades aren’t powered by the stones.\nCredit goes to Rushu, who asked why a Shardblade can be summoned and\ndismissed even if its gemstone has gone dun. We had no answers, and she\nspent the last few weeks in contact with Kharbranth, using one of those new\ninformation stations. She came up with a scrap from several decades after\nthe Recreance which talks about men learning to summon and dismiss\nBlades by adding gemstones to them, an accident of ornamentation it\nseems.”\nHe frowned as they passed a shalebark outcropping where a gardener\nwas working late, carefully filing away and humming to himself. The sun\nhad set; Salas had just risen in the east.\n“If this is true,” Navani said, sounding happy, “we’re back to knowing\nabsolutely nothing about how Shardblades were crafted.”\n“I don’t see why that’s a breakthrough at all.”\nShe smiled, patting him on the arm. “Imagine you had spent the last five\nyears believing an enemy had been following Dialectur’s War as a model\nfor tactics, but then heard it reported they instead had never heard of the\ntreatise.”\n“Ah…”\n“We had been assuming that somehow, the strength and lightness of the\nBlades was a fabrial construct powered by the gemstone,” Navani said.\n“This might not be the case. It seems the gemstone’s purpose is only used in\ninitially bonding the Blade—something that the Radiants didn’t need to\ndo.”\n“Wait. They didn’t?”\n“Not if this fragment is correct. The implication is that the Radiants\ncould always dismiss and summon Blades—but for a time the ability was\nlost. It was only recovered when someone added a gemstone to his Blade.\nThe fragment says the weapons actually shifted shape to adopt the stones,\nbut I’m not certain if I trust that.\n“Either way, after the Radiants fell but before men learned to put"

This\nwould explain several other fragments of records I’ve read and found\nconfusing…”\nShe continued, and he found her voice pleasant. The details of fabrial\nconstruction, however, were not pressing to him at the moment. He did\ncare. He had to care. Both for her, and for the needs of the kingdom.\nHe just couldn’t care right now. In his head, he went over preparations\nfor the expedition out onto the Shattered Plains. How to protect the\nSoulcasters from sight, as they preferred. Sanitation shouldn’t be an issue,\nand water would be plentiful. How many scribes would he need to bring?\nHorses? Only one week remained, and he had the majority of the\npreparations in place, such as mobile bridge construction and supply\nestimations. There was always more to plan, however.\nUnfortunately, the biggest variable was one he couldn’t plan for, not\nspecifically. He didn’t know how many troops he’d have. It depended on\nwhich of the highprinces, if any, agreed to go with him. Less than a week\nout, and he still wasn’t certain if any of them would.\nI could use Hatham most, Dalinar thought. He runs a tight army. If only\nAladar hadn’t sided with Sadeas so vigorously; I can’t figure that man out.\nThanadal and Bethab… storms, will I bring their mercenaries if either of\nthose two agree to come? Is that the kind of force I want? Dare I refuse any\nspear that comes to me?\n“I’m not going to get a good conversation out of you tonight, am I?”\nNavani asked.\n“No,” he admitted as they reached the base of the Pinnacle and turned\nsouth. “I’m sorry.”\nShe nodded, and he could see the mask cracking. She talked about her\nwork because it was something to talk about. He stopped beside her. “I\nknow it hurts,” he said softly. “But it will get better.”\n“She wouldn’t let me be a mother to her, Dalinar,” Navani said, staring\ninto the distance. “Do you know that? It was almost like… like once Jasnah\nclimbed into adolescence, she no longer needed a mother. I would try to get\nclose to her, and there was this coldness, like even being near me reminded\nher that she had once been a child. What happened to my little girl, so full\nof questions?”\nDalinar pulled her close; propriety could seek Damnation. Nearby, the\nthree guards shuffled, looking the other way.\n“They’ll take my son too,” Navani whispered. “They’re trying.”\n“I will protect him,” Dalinar promised.\n“And who will protect you?”\nHe had no answer to that. Answering that his guards would do it\nsounded trite. That wasn’t the question she’d asked. Who will protect you\nwhen that assassin returns?\n“I almost wish that you would fail,” she said. “In holding this kingdom\ntogether, you make a target of yourself.

If everything just collapsed, and we\nfractured back to princedoms, perhaps he’d leave us alone.”\n“And then the storm would come,” Dalinar replied softly. Twelve days.\nNavani eventually pulled back, nodding, composing herself. “You’re\nright, of course. I just… this is the first time, for me. Dealing with this.\nHow did you manage it, when Shshshsh died? I know you loved her,\nDalinar. You don’t have to deny it for my ego.”\nHe hesitated. The first time; an implication that when Gavilar had died,\nshe had not been broken up about it. She had never stated so outright an\nimplication of the… difficulties the two had been having.\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “Was that too difficult a question, considering its\nsource?” She tucked away her kerchief, which she’d used to dab her eyes\ndry. “I apologize; I know that you don’t like to talk about her.”\nIt wasn’t that it was a difficult question. It was that Dalinar didn’t\nremember his wife. How odd, that he could go weeks without even noticing\nthis hole in his memories, this change that had ripped out a piece of him and\nleft him patched over. Without even a prick of emotion when her name,\nwhich he could not hear, was mentioned.\nBest to move to some other topic. “I cannot help but assume that the\nassassin is involved in all of this, Navani. The storm that comes, the secrets\nof the Shattered Plains, even Gavilar. My brother knew something,\nsomething he never shared with any of us.” You must find the most\nimportant words a man can say. “I would give almost anything to know\nwhat it was.”\n“I suppose,” Navani said. “I will go back to my journals of the time.\nPerhaps he said something that would give us clues—though I warn you,\nI’ve pored over those accounts dozens of times.”\nDalinar nodded. “Regardless, that isn’t a worry for today. Today, they\nare our goal.”\nThey turned, looking as coaches clattered past, making their way to the\nnearby feasting basin, where lights glowed a soft violet in the night. He\nnarrowed his eyes and found Ruthar’s coach approaching. The highprince\nhad been stripped of Shards, all but his own Blade. They had cut off\nSadeas’s right hand in this mess, but the head remained. And it was\nvenomous.\nThe other highprinces were almost as big a problem as Sadeas. They\nresisted him because they wanted things to be easy, as they had been. They\nglutted themselves on their riches and their games. Feasts manifested that\nall too much, with their exotic food, their rich costumes.\nThe world itself seemed close to ending, and the Alethi threw a party.\n“You must not despise them,” Navani said.\nDalinar’s frown deepened. She could read him too well.\n“Listen to me, Dalinar,” she said, turning him to meet her eyes. “Has\nany good ever come from a father hating his children?”\n“I don’t hate them.”"

They live the lives they have known, the lives that\nsociety has taught them are proper. You won’t change them with contempt.\nYou aren’t Wit; it isn’t your job to scorn them. Your job is to enfold them,\nencourage them. Lead them, Dalinar.”\nHe drew a deep breath, and nodded.\n“I will go to the women’s island,” she said, noticing the bridgeman\nguard returning with news on the plateau assault. “They consider me an\neccentric vestige of things better left in the past, but I think they still listen\nto me. Sometimes. I’ll do what I can.”\nThey parted, Navani hurrying to the feast, Dalinar idling as the\nbridgeman passed his news. The plateau run had been successful, a\ngemheart captured. It had taken quite a long time to reach the target plateau,\nwhich was deep into the Plains—almost to the edge of the scouted area. The\nParshendi had not appeared to contest the gemheart, though their scouts had\nwatched from a distance.\nAgain they decide not to fight, Dalinar thought, walking the last distance\nto the feast. What does the change mean? What are they planning?\nThe feast basin was made up of a series of Soulcast islands beside the\nPinnacle complex. It had been flooded, as it often was, in a way that made\nthe Soulcast mounds rise between small rivers. The water glowed. Spheres,\nand a lot of them, must have been dumped into the water to give it that\nethereal cast. Purple, to match the moon that was just rising, violet and frail\non the horizon.\nLanterns were placed intermittently, but with dim spheres, perhaps to\nnot distract from the glowing water. Dalinar crossed the bridges to the\nfarthest island—the king’s island, where the genders mixed and only the\nmost powerful were invited. This was where he knew he’d find the\nhighprinces. Even Bethab, who had just returned from his plateau run, was\nalready in attendance—though, as he preferred to use mercenary companies\nfor the bulk of his army, it wasn’t surprising he had returned so quickly\nfrom the run. Once they captured the gemheart, he’d often ride back quickly\nwith the prize, letting them sort out how to return.\nDalinar passed Wit—who had arrived back at the warcamps with\ncharacteristic mystery—insulting everyone who passed. He had no wish to\nfence words with the man today. Instead, he sought out Vamah; the\nhighprince seemed to have actually listened to Dalinar’s pleas during their\nmost recent dinner. Perhaps with more nudging, he would commit to joining\nDalinar’s assault on the Parshendi.\nEyes followed Dalinar as he crossed the island, and whispered\nconversations broke out like rashes as he passed. He expected those looks\nby now, though they still unnerved him. Were they more plentiful this\nnight? More lingering?

        "text": "night? More lingering? He couldn’t move in Alethi society these days\nwithout catching a smile on the lips of too many people, as if they were all\npart of some grand joke that he had not been told.\nHe found Vamah speaking with a group of three older women. One was\nSivi, a highlady from Ruthar’s court who—contrary to custom—had left her\nhusband at home to see to their lands, coming to the Shattered Plains\nherself. She eyed Dalinar with a smile and eyes like daggers. The plot to\nundermine Sadeas had to a large extent failed—but that was in part because\nthe damage and shame had been deflected to Ruthar and Aladar, who had\nsuffered the loss of Shardbearers in the men who had dueled Adolin.\nWell, those two were never going to have been Dalinar’s—they were\nSadeas’s strongest supporters.\nThe four people grew silent as Dalinar stepped up to them. Highprince\nVamah squinted in the dim light, looking Dalinar up and down. The round-\nfaced man had a cupbearer standing behind him with a bottle of some exotic\nliquor or another. Vamah often brought his own spirits to feasts, regardless\nof who hosted them; being engaging enough a conversationalist to earn a\nsip of what he’d managed to import was considered a political triumph by\nmany attendees.\n“Vamah,” Dalinar said.\n“Dalinar.”\n“There’s a matter I’ve been wanting to discuss with you,” Dalinar said.\n“I find it impressive what you’ve been able to do with light cavalry on your\nplateau runs. Tell me, how do you decide when to risk an all-out assault\nwith your riders? The loss of horses could easily overwhelm your earnings\nfrom gemhearts, but you have managed to balance this with clever\nstratagems.”\n“I…” Vamah sighed, looking to the side. A group of young men nearby\nwas snickering as they looked toward Dalinar. “It is a matter of…”\nAnother sound, louder, came from the opposite side of the island.\nVamah started again, but his eyes flicked in that direction, and a round of\nlaughter burst out more loudly. Dalinar forced himself to look, noting\nwomen with hands to mouths, men covering their exclamations with\ncoughs. A halfhearted attempt at maintaining Alethi propriety.\nDalinar looked back at Vamah. “What is happening?”\n“I’m sorry, Dalinar.”\nBeside him, Sivi tucked some sheets of paper under her arm. She met\nDalinar’s gaze with a forced nonchalance.\n“Excuse me,” Dalinar said. Hands forming fists, he crossed the island\ntoward the source of the disturbance. As he neared, they quieted and people\nbroke up into smaller groups, moving off. It almost seemed planned how\nquickly they dispersed, leaving him to face Sadeas and Aladar, standing side\nby side.\n“What are you doing?” Dalinar demanded of the two of them.\n“Feasting,” Sadeas said, then shoved a piece of fruit into his mouth.\n“Obviously.”\nDalinar drew in a deep breath.

He glanced at Aladar, long-necked and\nbald, with his mustache and tuft of hair on his bottom lip. “You should be\nashamed,” Dalinar growled at him. “My brother once called you a friend.”\n“And not me?” Sadeas said.\n“What have you done?” Dalinar demanded. “What is everyone talking\nabout, snickering about behind their hands?”\n“You always assume it’s me,” Sadeas said.\n“That’s because any time I think it isn’t you, I’m wrong.”\nSadeas gave him a thin-lipped smile. He started to reply, but then\nthought a moment, and finally just stuffed another chunk of fruit in his\nmouth. He chewed and smiled.\n“Tastes good,” was all he said. He turned to walk away.\nAladar hesitated. Then he shook his head and followed.\n“I never figured you for a pup to follow at a master’s heels, Aladar,”\nDalinar called after him.\nNo reply.\nDalinar growled, moving back across the island, looking for someone\nfrom his own warcamp who might have heard what was happening. Elhokar\nwas late to his own feast, it seemed, though Dalinar did see him\napproaching outside now. No sign of Teshav or Khal yet—they would\nundoubtedly make an appearance, now that he was a Shardbearer.\nDalinar might have to move to one of the other islands, where lesser\nlighteyes would be mingling. He started that way, but stopped as he heard\nsomething.\n“Why, Brightlord Amaram,” Wit cried. “I was hoping I’d be able to see\nyou tonight. I’ve spent my life learning to make others feel miserable, and\nso it’s a true joy to meet someone so innately talented in that very skill as\nyou are.”\nDalinar turned, noticing Amaram, who had just arrived. He wore his\ncape of the Knights Radiant and carried a sheaf of papers stuck under his\narm. He stopped beside Wit’s chair, the nearby water casting a lavender\ntone across their skin.\n“Do I know you?” Amaram asked.\n“No,” Wit said lightly, “but fortunately, you can add it to the list of\nmany, many things of which you are ignorant.”\n“But now I’ve met you,” Amaram said, holding out a hand. “So the list\nis one smaller.”\n“Please,” Wit said, refusing the hand. “I wouldn’t want it to rub off on\nme.”\n“It?”\n“Whatever you’ve been using to make your hands look clean,\nBrightlord Amaram. It must be powerful stuff indeed.”\nDalinar hurried over.\n“Dalinar,” Wit said, nodding.\n“Wit. Amaram, what are those papers?”\n“One of your clerks seized them and brought them to me,” Amaram\nsaid. “Copies were being passed around the feast before your arrival. Your\nclerk thought Brightness Navani might want to see them if she hasn’t\nalready. Where is she?”\n“Staying away from you, obviously,” Wit noted. “Lucky woman.”\n“Wit,” Dalinar said sternly, “do you mind?”\n“Rarely.”\nDalinar sighed, looking back to Amaram and taking the papers."

Do you know what these say?”\nAmaram’s expression grew grim. “I wish I didn’t.”\n“I could hit you in the head with a hammer,” Wit said happily. “A good\nbludgeoning would make you forget and do wonders for that face of yours.”\n“Wit,” Dalinar said flatly.\n“I’m only joking.”\n“Good.”\n“A hammer would hardly dent that thick skull of his.”\nAmaram turned to Wit, a look of bafflement on his face.\n“You’re very good at that expression,” Wit noted. “A great deal of\npractice, I assume?”\n“This is the new Wit?” Amaram asked.\n“I mean,” Wit said, “I wouldn’t want to call Amaram an imbecile…”\nDalinar nodded.\n“… because then I’d have to explain to him what the word means, and\nI’m not certain any of us have the requisite time.”\nAmaram sighed. “Why hasn’t anyone killed him yet?”\n“Dumb luck,” Wit said. “In that I’m lucky you’re all so dumb.”\n“Thank you, Wit,” Dalinar said, taking Amaram by the arm and towing\nhim to the side.\n“One more, Dalinar!” Wit said. “Just one last insult, and I leave him\nalone.”\nThey continued walking.\n“Lord Amaram,” Wit called, standing to bow, his voice growing solemn.\n“I salute you. You are what lesser cretins like Sadeas can only aspire to be.”\n“The papers?” Dalinar said to Amaram, pointedly ignoring Wit.\n“They are accounts of your… experiences, Brightlord,” Amaram said\nsoftly. “The ones you have during the storms. Written by Brightness Navani\nherself.”\nDalinar took the papers. His visions. He looked up and saw groups of\npeople collecting on the island, chatting and laughing, shooting glances at\nhim.\n“I see,” he said softly. It made sense now, the hidden snickering. “Find\nBrightness Navani for me, if you would.”\n“As you request,” Amaram said, but stopped short, pointing. Navani\nstalked across the next island over, heading toward them with a\ntempestuous air about her.\n“What do you think, Amaram?” Dalinar said. “Of the things that are\nbeing said of me?”\nAmaram met his eyes. “They are obviously visions from the Almighty\nhimself, given to us in a time of great need. I wish I had known their\ncontents earlier. They give me great confidence in my position, and in your\nappointment as prophet of the Almighty.”\n“A dead god can have no prophets.”\n“Dead… No, Dalinar! You obviously misinterpret that comment from\nyour visions. He speaks of being dead in the minds of men, that they no\nlonger listen to his commands. God cannot die.”\nAmaram seemed so earnest. Why didn’t he help your sons? Kaladin’s\nvoice rang in Dalinar’s mind.

He\nsaid he needed to be above the squabbles between highprinces, even when it\npained him.\n“And the supposed Herald?” Dalinar asked. “The thing I asked you\nabout?”\n“I am still investigating.”\nDalinar nodded.\n“I was surprised,” Amaram noted, “that you left the slave as head of\nyour guard.” He glanced to the side, to where Dalinar’s guards for the night\nstood, just off the island in their own area, waiting with the other\nbodyguards and attendants, including many of the wards of the highladies\npresent.\nThere had been a time not too long ago when few had felt the need to\nbring their guards with them to a feast. Now, the place was crowded.\nCaptain Kaladin wasn’t there; he was resting, after his imprisonment.\n“He’s a good soldier,” Dalinar said softly. “He just carries a few scars\nthat are having trouble healing.” Vedeledev knows, Dalinar thought, I have a\nfew of those myself.\n“I merely worry that he is incapable of properly protecting you,”\nAmaram said. “Your life is important, Dalinar. We need your visions, your\nleadership. Still, if you trust the slave, then so be it—though I certainly\nwouldn’t mind hearing an apology from him. Not for my own ego, but to\nknow that he’s put aside this misconception of his.”\nDalinar gave no reply as Navani strode across the short bridge onto their\nisland. Wit started to proclaim an insult, but she swatted him in the face\nwith a stack of papers, giving him barely a glance as she continued on\ntoward Dalinar. Wit watched after, rubbing his cheek, and grinned.\nShe noted the papers in his hand as she joined the two of them, who\nseemed to stand among a sea of amused eyes and hushed laughter.\n“They added words,” Navani hissed.\n“What?” Dalinar demanded.\nShe shook the papers. “These! You’ve heard what they contain?”\nHe nodded.\n“They aren’t as I wrote them,” Navani said. “They’ve changed the tone,\nsome of my words, to imply a ridiculousness to the entire experience—and\nto make it sound as if I am merely indulging you. What’s worse, they added\na commentary in another handwriting that pokes fun at what you say and\ndo.” She took a deep breath, as if to calm herself. “Dalinar, they’re trying to\ndestroy any shred of credibility left to your name.”\n“I see.”\n“How did they get these?” Amaram asked.\n“Through theft, I do not doubt,” Dalinar said, realizing something.\n“Navani and my sons always have guards—but when they leave their\nrooms, those are relatively unprotected. We may have been too lax in that\nregard. I misunderstood. I thought his attacks would be physical.”\nNavani looked out at the sea of lighteyes, many congregating in groups\naround the various highprinces in the soft, violet light. She stepped closer to\nDalinar, and though her eyes were fierce, he knew her well enough to guess\nwhat she was feeling. Betrayal. Invasion. That which was private to them,"

That which was private to them,\nopened up, mocked and then displayed for the world.\n“Dalinar, I’m sorry,” Amaram said.\n“They did not change the visions themselves?” Dalinar asked. “They\ncopied them accurately.”\n“So far as I can tell, yes,” Navani said. “But the tone is different, and\nthat mockery. Storms. It’s nauseating. When I find the woman who did\nthis…”\n“Peace, Navani,” Dalinar said, resting his hand on her shoulder.\n“How can you say that?”\n“Because this is the act of childish men who assume that I can be\nembarrassed by the truth.”\n“But the commentary! The changes. They’ve done everything they can\nto discredit you. They even managed to undermine the part where you offer\na translation of the Dawnchant. It—”\n“‘As I fear not a child with a weapon he cannot lift, I will never fear the\nmind of a man who does not think.’”\nNavani frowned at him.\n“It’s from The Way of Kings,” Dalinar said. “I am not a youth, nervous\nat his first feast. Sadeas makes a mistake in believing I will respond to this\nas he would. Unlike a sword, scorn has only the bite you give it.”\n“This does hurt you,” Navani said, meeting his eyes. “I can see it,\nDalinar.”\nHopefully, the others would not know him well enough to see what she\ndid. Yes, it did hurt. It hurt because these visions were his, entrusted to him\n—to be shared for the good of men, not to be held up for mockery. It was\nnot the laughter itself that pained him, but the loss of what could have been.\nHe stepped away from her, passing through the crowd. Some of those\neyes he now interpreted as being sorrowful, not just amused. Perhaps he\nwas imagining it, but he thought some pitied him more than scorned him.\nHe wasn’t certain which emotion was more damaging.\nDalinar reached the food table at the back of the island. There, he\npicked up a large pan and handed it to a bewildered serving woman, then\nhauled himself up onto the table. He set one hand on the lantern pole beside\nthe table and looked out over the small crowd. They were the most\nimportant people in Alethkar.\nThose who hadn’t already been watching him turned with shock to see\nhim up there. In the distance, he noticed Adolin and Brightness Shallan\nrushing onto the island. They’d likely only just arrived, and heard the talk.\nDalinar looked to the crowd. “What you have read,” he bellowed, “is\ntrue.”\nStunned silence. Making a spectacle of oneself in this way was not done\nin Alethkar. He, however, had already been this evening’s spectacle.\n“Commentary has been added to discredit me,” Dalinar said, “and the\ntone of Navani’s writing has been changed. But I will not hide what has\nbeen happening to me. I see visions from the Almighty. They come with\nalmost every storm. This should not surprise you.

There have been rumors\ncirculating about my experiences for weeks now. Perhaps I should have\nreleased these visions already. In the future, each one I receive will be\npublished, so that scholars around the world can investigate what I have\nseen.”\nHe sought out Sadeas, who stood with Aladar and Ruthar. Dalinar\ngripped the lantern pole, looking back at the Alethi crowd. “I do not blame\nyou for thinking I am mad. It is natural. But in the coming nights, when rain\nwashes your walls and the wind howls, you will wonder. You will question.\nAnd soon, when I offer you proof, you will know. This attempt to destroy\nme will then vindicate me instead.”\nHe looked over their faces, some aghast, some sympathetic, others\namused.\n“There are those among you who assume I will flee, or be broken,\nbecause of this attack,” he said. “They do not know me as well as they\npresume. Let the feast continue, for I wish to speak with each and every one\nof you. The words you hold may mock, but if you must laugh, do it while\nlooking me in the eyes.”\nHe stepped down from the table.\nThen he went to work.\n* * *\nHours later, Dalinar eventually let himself sit down in a seat beside a\ntable at the feast, exhaustionspren swirling around him. He’d spent the rest\nof the evening moving through the crowd, forcing his way into\nconversations, drumming up support for his excursion onto the Plains.\nHe had pointedly ignored the pages with his visions on them, except\nwhen asked direct questions about what he’d seen. Instead, he had\npresented them with a forceful, confident man—the Blackthorn turned\npolitician. Let them chew on that and compare him to the frail madman the\nfalsified transcripts would make him out to be.\nOutside, past the small rivers—they now glowed blue, the spheres\nhaving been changed to match the second moon—the king’s carriage rolled\naway, bearing Elhokar and Navani the short distance to the Pinnacle, where\nporters would carry them in a palanquin up to the top. Adolin had already\nretired, escorting Shallan back to Sebarial’s warcamp, which was a fair ride\naway.\nAdolin seemed to be fonder of the young Veden woman than of any\nwoman in the recent past. For that reason alone, Dalinar was increasingly\ninclined to encourage the relationship, assuming he could ever get some\nstraight answers out of Jah Keved about her family. That kingdom was a\nmess.\nMost of the other lighteyes had retired, leaving him on an island\npopulated by servants and parshmen who cleared away food. A few master-\nservants, trusted for such duties, began to scoop the spheres out of the river\nwith nets on long poles. Dalinar’s bridgemen, at his suggestion, were\nattacking the feast’s leftovers with the voracious appetite exclusive to\nsoldiers who had been offered an unexpected meal.\nA servant strolled by, then stopped, resting his hand on his side sword.\nDalinar started, realizing he’d mistaken Wit’s black military uniform for\nthat of a master-servant in training."

Wit? Now?\nDalinar felt as if he’d been fighting on the battlefield for ten hours straight.\nOdd, how a few hours of delicate conversation could feel so similar to that.\n“What you did tonight was clever,” Wit said. “You turned an attack into\na promise. The wisest of men know that to render an insult powerless, you\noften need only to embrace it.”\n“Thank you,” Dalinar said.\nWit nodded curtly, following the king’s coach with his eyes as it\nvanished. “I found myself without much to do tonight. Elhokar was not in\nneed of Wit, as few sought to speak to him. All came to you instead.”\nDalinar sighed, his strength seeming to drain away. Wit hadn’t said it,\nbut he hadn’t needed to. Dalinar read the implication.\nThey came to you, instead of the king. Because essentially, you are king.\n“Wit,” Dalinar found himself asking, “am I a tyrant?”\nWit cocked an eyebrow, and seemed to be looking for a clever quip. A\nmoment later, he discarded the thought. “Yes, Dalinar Kholin,” he said\nsoftly, consolingly, as one might speak to a tearful child. “You are.”\n“I do not wish to be.”\n“With all due respect, Brightlord, that is not quite the truth. You seek for\npower. You take hold, and let go only with great difficulty.”\nDalinar bowed his head.\n“Do not sorrow,” Wit said. “It is an era for tyrants. I doubt this place is\nready for anything more, and a benevolent tyrant is preferable to the\ndisaster of weak rule. Perhaps in another place and time, I’d have\ndenounced you with spit and bile. Here, today, I praise you as what this\nworld needs.”\nDalinar shook his head. “I should have allowed Elhokar his right of\nrule, and not interfered as I did.”\n“Why?”\n“Because he is king.”\n“And that position is something sacrosanct? Divine?”\n“No,” Dalinar admitted. “The Almighty, or the one claiming to be him,\nis dead. Even if he hadn’t been, the kingship didn’t come to our family\nnaturally. We claimed it, and forced it upon the other highprinces.”\n“So then why?”\n“Because we were wrong,” Dalinar said, narrowing his eyes. “Gavilar,\nSadeas, and I were wrong to do as we did all those years ago.”\nWit seemed genuinely surprised. “You unified the kingdom, Dalinar.\nYou did a good work, something that was sorely needed.”\n“This is unity?” Dalinar asked, waving a hand back toward the scattered\nremnants of the feast, the departing lighteyes. “No, Wit. We failed. We\ncrushed, we killed, and we have failed miserably.” He looked up. “I receive,\nin Alethkar, only what I have demanded. In taking the throne by force, we\nimplied—no we screamed—that strength is the right of rule. If Sadeas"

If Sadeas\nthinks he is stronger than I am, then it is his duty to try to take the throne\nfrom me. These are the fruits of my youth, Wit. It is why we need more than\ntyranny, even the benevolent kind, to transform this kingdom. That is what\nNohadon was teaching. And that is what I’ve been missing all along.”\nWit nodded, looking thoughtful. “I need to read that book of yours\nagain, it seems. I wanted to warn you, however. I’ll be leaving soon.”\n“Leave?” Dalinar said. “You only just arrived.”\n“I know. It’s incredibly frustrating, I must admit. I have discovered a\nplace that I must be, though to be honest I’m not exactly sure why I need to\nbe there. This doesn’t always work as well as I’d like it to.”\nDalinar frowned at him. Wit smiled back affably.\n“Are you one of them?” Dalinar asked.\n“Excuse me?”\n“A Herald.”\nWit laughed. “No. Thank you, but no.”\n“Are you what I’ve been looking for, then?” Dalinar asked. “Radiant?”\nWit smiled. “I am but a man, Dalinar, so much as I wish it were not true\nat times. I am no Radiant. And while I am your friend, please understand\nthat our goals do not completely align. You must not trust yourself with me.\nIf I have to watch this world crumble and burn to get what I need, I will do\nso. With tears, yes, but I would let it happen.”\nDalinar frowned.\n“I will do what I can to help,” Wit said, “and for that reason, I must go. I\ncannot risk too much, because if he finds me, then I become nothing—a\nsoul shredded and broken into pieces that cannot be reassembled. What I do\nhere is more dangerous than you could ever know.”\nHe turned to go.\n“Wit,” Dalinar called.\n“Yes?”\n“If who finds you?”\n“The one you fight, Dalinar Kholin. The father of hatred.” Wit saluted,\nthen jogged off.\n68.

Storms… even looking across the Plains made Kaladin flinch.\nHe could hear the hiss of arrows in the air, the screams of terrified\nbridgemen, the song of the Parshendi.\nI should have been able to save more of Bridge Four, Kaladin thought.\nIf I’d been faster to accept my powers, could I have done so?\nHe breathed in Stormlight to reassure himself. Only it didn’t come. He\nstood, dumbfounded, while soldiers marched across one of Dalinar’s\nenormous mechanical bridges. He tried again. Nothing.\nHe fished a sphere from his pouch. The firemark glowed with its\ncustomary light, tinting his fingers red. Something was wrong. Kaladin\ncouldn’t feel the Stormlight inside as he once had.\nSyl flitted across the chasm high in the air with a group of windspren.\nHer giggling laughter rained down upon him, and he looked up. “Syl?” he\nasked quietly. Storms. He didn’t want to look like an idiot, but something\ndeep within him was panicking like a rat caught by its tail. “Syl!”\nSeveral marching soldiers glanced at Kaladin, then up toward the air.\nKaladin ignored them as Syl zipped down in the form of a ribbon of light.\nShe swirled around him, still giggling.\nThe Stormlight returned to him. He could feel it again, and he greedily\nsucked it from the sphere—though he did have the presence of mind to\nclutch the sphere in a fist and hold it to his chest to make the process less\nobvious. The Light of one mark wasn’t enough to expose him, but he felt\nfar, far better with that Stormlight raging inside of him.\n“What happened?” Kaladin whispered to Syl. “Is something wrong with\nour bond? Is it because I haven’t found the Words soon enough?”\nShe landed on his wrist and took the form of a young woman. She\npeered at his hand, cocking her head. “What’s inside?” she asked with a\nconspiratorial whisper.\n“You know what this is, Syl,” Kaladin said, feeling chilled, as if he’d\nbeen hit by a wave of stormwater. “A sphere. Didn’t you see it just now?”\nShe looked at him, face innocent. “You are making bad choices.\nNaughty.” Her features mimicked his for a moment and she jumped\nforward, as if to startle him. She laughed and zipped away.\nBad choices. Naughty. So, this was because of his promise to Moash\nthat he’d help assassinate the king. Kaladin sighed, continuing forward.\nSyl couldn’t see why his decision was the right one. She was a spren,\nand had a stupid, simplistic morality. To be human was often to be forced to\nchoose between distasteful options. Life wasn’t clean and neat like she\nwanted it to be. It was messy, coated with crem. No man walked through\nlife without getting covered in it, not even Dalinar.\n“You want too much of me,” he snapped at her as he reached the other\nside of the chasm. “I’m not some glorious knight of ancient days. I’m a\nbroken man. Do you hear me, Syl? I’m broken.”\nShe zipped up to him and whispered, “That’s what they all were, silly.”"

I’m broken.”\nShe zipped up to him and whispered, “That’s what they all were, silly.”\nShe streaked away.\nKaladin watched as the soldiers filed across the bridge. They weren’t\ndoing a plateau run, but Dalinar had brought plenty of soldiers anyway.\nGoing out onto the Shattered Plains was entering a war zone, and the\nParshendi were ever a threat.\nBridge Four tromped across the mechanical bridge, carrying their\nsmaller one. Kaladin wasn’t about to leave the camps without that. These\nmechanisms Dalinar employed—the massive, chull-pulled bridges that\ncould be ratcheted down into place—were amazing, but Kaladin didn’t trust\nthem. Not nearly as much as he did a good bridge on his shoulders.\nSyl flitted by again. Did she really expect him to live according to her\nperception of what was right and wrong? Was she going to yank his powers\naway every time he did something that risked offending her?\nThat would be like living with a noose around his neck.\nDetermined to not let his worries ruin the day, he went to check on\nBridge Four. Look at the open sky, he told himself. Breathe the wind. Enjoy\nthe freedom. After so much time in captivity, these things were wonders.\nHe found Bridge Four beside their bridge at parade rest. It was odd to\nsee them with their old padded-shoulder leather vests on over their new\nuniforms. It transformed them into a weird mix of what they had been and\nwhat they were now. They saluted him together, and he saluted back.\n“At ease,” he told them, and they broke formation, laughing and joking\nwith one another as Lopen and his assistants distributed waterskins.\n“Ha!” Rock said, settling down on the side of the bridge to drink. “This\nthing, it is not so hard as I remember it being.”\n“It’s because we’re going slower,” Kaladin said, pointing at Dalinar’s\nmechanical bridge. “And because you’re remembering the early days of\nbridge carries, not the later ones when we were well-fed and well-trained. It\ngot easier then.”\n“No,” Rock said. “The bridge is light because we have defeated Sadeas.\nIs the proper way of things.”\n“That makes no sense.”\n“Ha! Perfect sense.” He took a drink. “Airsick lowlander.”\nKaladin shook his head, but let himself find a smile at Rock’s familiar\nvoice. After slaking his own thirst, he jogged across the plateau toward\nwhere Dalinar had just finished crossing. Nearby, a tall rock formation\nsurmounted the plateau, and atop it was a wooden structure like a small fort.\nSunlight glinted off one of the spyglasses fitted there.\nNo permanent bridge led to this plateau, which was just outside the\nsecure area closest to the warcamp. These scouts positioned here were\nvaulters, who leaped chasms at narrow points with the use of long poles. It\nseemed like a job that would require a special brand of craziness—and\nbecause of that, Kaladin had always felt respect for these men.\nOne of the vaulters was speaking with Dalinar.

It was a man, a glowing one, who flew around in the sky back\nand forth over the Plains.”\nDalinar grunted.\n“I’m not crazy, sir,” the vaulter said, shuffling from one foot to the\nother. “The other lads saw it too, once I—”\n“I believe you, soldier,” Dalinar said. “It was the Assassin in White. He\nlooked like that when he came for the king.”\nThe man relaxed. “Brightlord, sir, that’s what I thought. Some of the\nmen back at camp told me I was just seeing what I wanted.”\n“Nobody wants to see that one,” Dalinar said. “But why would he spend\nhis time out here? Why hasn’t he come back to attack, if he’s this close?”\nKaladin cleared his throat, uncomfortable, and pointed at the\nwatchman’s post. “That fort up there, is it wood?”\n“Yes,” the vaulter said, then noticed the knots on Kaladin’s shoulders.\n“Uh, sir.”\n“That can’t possibly withstand a highstorm,” Kaladin said.\n“We break it down, sir.”\n“And carry it back to camp?” Kaladin asked, frowning. “Or do you\nleave it out here for the storm?”\n“Leave it, sir?” the short man said. “We stay here with it.” He pointed\ntoward a burrowed-out section of rock, cut with hammers or a Shardblade,\nat the base of the stone formation. It didn’t look very large—just a cubby,\nreally. It looked like they took the wooden floor of the platform up above,\nthen locked it into place with clasps at the side of the cubby to form a kind\nof door.\nA special kind of crazy indeed.\n“Brightlord, sir,” the vaulter said to Dalinar, “the one in white might be\nout here somewhere. Waiting.”\n“Thank you, soldier,” Dalinar said, nodding his dismissal. “Keep an eye\nout for us while we travel. We’ve had reports of a chasmfiend moving in\nclose to the camps.”\n“Yes, sir,” the man said, saluting and then jogging back toward the rope\nladder leading up to his post.\n“What if the assassin does come for you?” Kaladin asked softly.\n“I don’t see how it would be any different out here,” Dalinar said.\n“He’ll be back eventually. On the Plains or in the palace, we’ll have to fight\nhim.”\nKaladin grunted. “I wish you’d accept one of those Shardblades that\nAdolin has been winning, sir. I’d feel more comfortable if you could defend\nyourself.”\n“I think you’d be surprised,” Dalinar said, shading his eyes, turning\ntoward the warcamp. “I do feel wrong leaving Elhokar alone back there,\nthough.”"

I can’t help but feel I’m missing something important, something right\nin front of me.”\nKaladin set his jaw, trying to ignore the chill he felt. Order you to stay\nwith him next time… It was almost like fate itself was pushing Kaladin to be\nin a position to betray the king.\n“About your imprisonment,” the highprince said.\n“Already forgotten, sir,” Kaladin said. Dalinar’s part in it, at least. “I\nappreciate not being demoted.”\n“You’re a good soldier,” Dalinar said. “Most of the time.” His eyes\nflicked toward Bridge Four, picking up their bridge. One of the men at the\nside drew his attention in particular: Renarin, wearing his Bridge Four\nuniform, hefting the bridge into place. Nearby, Leyten laughed and gave\nhim pointers on how to hold the thing.\n“He’s actually starting to fit in, sir,” Kaladin said. “The men like him. I\nnever thought I’d see the day.”\nDalinar nodded.\n“How was he?” Kaladin asked softly. “After what happened in the\narena?”\n“He refused to go practice with Zahel,” Dalinar said. “So far as I know,\nhe hasn’t summoned his Shardblade in weeks.” He watched for a moment\nlonger. “I can’t decide if his time with your men is good for him—helping\nhim think like a soldier—or if it’s just encouraging him to avoid his greater\nresponsibilities.”\n“Sir,” Kaladin said. “If I may say so, your son seems like kind of a\nmisfit. Out of place. Awkward, alone.”\nDalinar nodded.\n“Then, I can say with confidence that Bridge Four is probably the best\nplace he could find himself.” It felt odd to be saying it of a lighteyes, but it\nwas true.\nDalinar grunted. “I’ll trust your judgment. Go. Make sure those men of\nyours are on the watch for the assassin, in case he does come today.”\nKaladin nodded, leaving the highprince behind. He’d heard about\nDalinar’s visions before—and had had an inkling of their contents. He\ndidn’t know what he thought, but he intended to get a copy of the vision\nrecords in their entirety so he could have Ka read it to him.\nPerhaps these visions were why Syl was always so determined to trust\nDalinar.\nAs the day passed, the army moved across the Plains like the flow of\nsome viscous liquid—mud dribbling down a shallow incline. All of this so\nShallan could see a chasmfiend chrysalis. Kaladin shook his head, crossing\na plateau. Adolin was certainly smitten; he’d managed to roll out an entire\nstrike force, his father included, just to sate the girl’s whims."

        "text": "a plateau. Adolin was certainly smitten; he’d managed to roll out an entire\nstrike force, his father included, just to sate the girl’s whims.\n“Walking, Kaladin?” Adolin said, trotting up. The prince rode that white\nbeast of a horse, the thing with the hooves like hammers. Adolin wore his\nfull suit of blue Shardplate, helm tied to a knob on the back of the saddle. “I\nthought you had full requisition right from my father’s stables.”\n“I have full requisition right from the quartermasters too,” Kaladin said,\n“but you don’t see me hiking out here with a cauldron on my back just\nbecause I can.”\nAdolin chuckled. “You should try riding more. You have to admit that\nthere are advantages. The speed of the gallop, the height of attack.” He\npatted his horse on the neck.\n“I guess I just trust my own feet too much.”\nAdolin nodded, as if that had been the wisest thing a man had ever said,\nbefore riding back to check on Shallan in her palanquin. Feeling a little\nfatigued, Kaladin fished in his pocket for another sphere, just a diamond\nchip this time, and held it to his chest. He breathed in.\nAgain, nothing happened. Storm it! He looked about for Syl, but\ncouldn’t find her. She’d been so playful lately, he was starting to wonder if\nthis was all some kind of trick. He actually hoped it was that, and not\nsomething more. Despite his inward grousing and complaints, he\ndesperately wanted this power. He had claimed the sky, the winds\nthemselves. Giving them up would be like giving up his own hands.\nHe eventually reached the edge of their current plateau, where Dalinar’s\nmechanical bridge was setting up. Here, blessedly, he found Syl inspecting\na cremling crawling across the rocks toward the safety of a nearby crack.\nKaladin sat down on a rock beside her. “So you’re punishing me,” he\nsaid. “For agreeing to help Moash. That’s why I’m having trouble with the\nStormlight.”\nSyl followed along behind the cremling, which was a kind of beetle\nwith a round, iridescent shell.\n“Syl?” Kaladin asked. “Are you all right? You seem…”\nLike you were before. When we first met. It made a feeling of dread rise\nwithin him to acknowledge it. If his powers were withdrawing, was it\nbecause the bond itself was weakening?\nShe looked up at him, and her eyes became more focused, her\nexpression like that of her normal self. “You have to decide what you want,\nKaladin,” she said.\n“You don’t like Moash’s plan,” Kaladin said. “Are you trying to force\nme to change my mind regarding him?”\nShe scrunched up her face. “I don’t want to force you to do anything.\nYou have to do what you think is right.”\n“That’s what I’m trying to do!”\n“No. I don’t think you are.”\n“Fine. I’ll tell Moash and his friends that I’m out, that I’m not going to\nhelp them.”\n“But you gave Moash your word!”\n“I gave my word to Dalinar too…”\nShe drew her lips to a line, meeting his eyes."

Was this the sort\nof thing that had destroyed the Knights Radiant?\nWhat happened to your honorspren when you confronted them with a\nchoice like this? A broken vow either way.\nIdiot, Kaladin thought at himself. It seemed he couldn’t make any right\nchoices these days.\n“What do I do, Syl?” he whispered.\nShe flitted up until she was standing in the air just before him, eyes\nmeeting his. “You must speak the Words.”\n“I don’t know them.”\n“Find them.” She looked toward the sky. “Find them soon, Kaladin.\nAnd no, simply telling Moash you won’t help isn’t going to work. We’ve\ngone too far for that. You need to do what your heart needs to do.” She rose\nupward toward the sky.\n“Stay with me, Syl,” he whispered after her, standing. “I’ll figure this\nout. Just… don’t lose yourself. Please. I need you.”\nNearby, gears on Dalinar’s bridge mechanism turned as soldiers twisted\nlevers, and the entire thing started to unfold.\n“Stop, stop, stop!” Shallan Davar jogged up, a flurry of red hair and\nblue silk, a large floppy hat on her head to keep off the sun. Two of her\nguards jogged after her, but neither was Gaz.\nKaladin spun about, alarmed at her tone, searching for signs of the\nAssassin in White.\nShallan, puffing, raised her safehand to her chest. “Storms, what is\nwrong with palanquin porters? They absolutely refuse to move quickly. ‘It’s\nnot stately,’ they say. Well, I don’t really do stately. All right, give me a\nminute, then you can continue.”\nShe settled down on a rock near the bridge. The baffled soldiers\nregarded her as she dug out her drawing pad, then started sketching. “All\nright,” she said. “Continue. I’ve been trying all day to get a progressive\nsketch of that bridge as it unfolds. Storming porters.”\nWhat a bizarre woman.\nThe soldiers hesitantly continued positioning the bridge, unfolding it\nbeneath the watchful eyes of three of Dalinar’s engineers—widowed wives\nof his fallen officers. Several carpenters were also on hand to work at their\norders if the bridge got stuck or a piece snapped.\nKaladin gripped his spear, trying to sort through his emotions regarding\nSyl, and the promises he’d made. Surely he could work this out somehow.\nCouldn’t he?\nSeeing this bridge intruded on his mind with thoughts of bridge runs,\nand he found that a welcome distraction. He could see why Sadeas had\npreferred the simple, if brutal, method of the bridge crews. Those bridges\nwere faster, cheaper, and less prone to problems. These massive things were\nponderous, like big ships trying to maneuver in a bay.\nArmored bridge runners is the natural solution, Kaladin thought.

Men\nwith shields, with full support from the army to get them into position. You\ncould have fast, mobile bridges, but also not leave men to be slaughtered.\nOf course, Sadeas had wanted the bridgemen killed, as bait to keep\narrows away from his soldiers.\nOne of the carpenters helping with the bridge—examining one of the\nwooden steadying pins and talking about carving a new one—was familiar\nto Kaladin. The stout man had a birthmark across his forehead, shaded by\nthe carpenter’s cap he wore.\nKaladin knew that face. Had the man been one of Dalinar’s soldiers, one\nof those who had lost the will to fight following the slaughter on the Tower?\nSome of those had switched to other duties in camp.\nHe was distracted as Moash walked over, raising a hand toward Bridge\nFour, who cheered him. Moash’s brilliant Shardplate—which he’d had\nrepainted blue with red accents at the points—looked surprisingly natural\non him. It hadn’t even been a week yet, but Moash walked in the armor\neasily.\nHe stepped up to Kaladin, then knelt down on one knee, Plate clinking.\nHe saluted, arm across chest.\nHis eyes… they were lighter in color; tan instead of deep brown as\nthey’d once been. He wore his Shardblade strapped across his back in a\nguarded sheath. Only one more day until he had it bonded.\n“You don’t need to salute me, Moash,” Kaladin said. “You’re lighteyed\nnow. You outrank me by a mile or two.”\n“I’ll never outrank you, Kal,” Moash said, faceplate of his helm up.\n“You’re my captain. Forever.” He grinned. “But I can’t tell you how much\nstorming fun it is to watch the lighteyes try to figure out how to deal with\nme.”\n“Your eyes are really changing.”\n“Yeah,” Moash said. “But I’m not one of them, you hear me? I’m one of\nus. Bridge Four. I’m our… secret weapon.”\n“Secret?” Kaladin asked, raising an eyebrow. “They’ve probably heard\nabout you all the way in Iri by now, Moash. You’re the first darkeyed man\nto be given a Blade and Plate in over a lifetime.”\nDalinar had even granted Moash lands and a stipend from them, a lavish\nsum, and not just by bridgeman standards. Moash still stopped by for stew\nsome nights, but not all. He was too busy arranging his new quarters.\nThere was nothing wrong with that. It was natural. It was also part of\nwhy Kaladin had turned down the Blade himself—and perhaps why he’d\nalways been worried about showing his powers to the lighteyes. Even if\nthey didn’t find a way to take the abilities from him—he knew that fear was\nirrational, though he felt it all the same—they might find a way to take\nBridge Four from him. His men… his very self.\nThey might not be the ones who take it from you, Kaladin thought. You\nmight be doing it to yourself, better than any lighteyes could.\nThe thought nauseated him.\n“We’re getting close,” Moash said softly as Kaladin took out his"

He lowered the waterskin and looked over his\nshoulder across the plateaus. “I thought we still had a few hours to go\nbefore we reached the dead chrysalis.”\nIt was far out, almost as far out as the armies went on bridge runs.\nBethab and Thanadal had claimed it yesterday.\n“Not that,” Moash said, looking to the side. “Other things.”\n“Oh. Moash, are you… I mean…”\n“Kal,” Moash said. “You’re with us, right? You said it.”\nTwo promises. Syl told him to follow his heart.\n“Kaladin,” Moash said, more solemnly. “You gave me these Shards,\neven after you were angry with me for disobeying you. There’s a reason.\nYou know, deep down, that what I’m doing is right. It’s the only solution.”\nKaladin nodded.\nMoash glanced around, then stood up, Plate clinking. He leaned in to\nwhisper. “Don’t worry. Graves says you aren’t going to have to do much.\nWe just need an opening.”\nKaladin felt sick. “We can’t do it when Dalinar is in the warcamp,” he\nwhispered. “I won’t risk him being hurt.”\n“No problem,” Moash said. “We feel the same way. We’ll wait for the\nright moment. The newest plan is to hit the king with an arrow, so there’s no\nrisk of implicating you or anyone else. You lead him to the right spot, and\nGraves will fell the king with his own bow. He’s an excellent shot.”\nAn arrow. It felt so cowardly.\nIt needed to be done. It needed to be.\nMoash patted him on the shoulder, stepping off in his clinking\nShardplate. Storms. All Kaladin had to do was lead the king into a specific\nspot… that, and betray Dalinar’s trust in him.\nAnd if I don’t help kill the king, won’t I be betraying justice and honor?\nThe king had murdered—or as good as murdered—many people, some\nthrough indifference, others through incompetence. And storms, Dalinar\nwasn’t innocent either. If he’d been as noble as he pretended, wouldn’t he\nhave seen Roshone imprisoned, rather than shipped off somewhere where\nhe “couldn’t do any more harm”?\nKaladin walked over to the bridge, watching the men march across.\nShallan Davar sat primly on a rock, continuing her sketches of the bridge\nmechanism. Adolin had climbed off his horse and handed it to some grooms\nfor watering. He waved Kaladin over.\n“Princeling?” Kaladin asked, stepping up.\n“The assassin has been seen out here,” Adolin said. “On the Plains at\nnight.”\n“Yes. I heard the scout telling your father about it.”\n“We need a plan. What if he attacks out here?”\n“I hope he does.”\nAdolin looked to him, frowning.\n“From what I saw,” Kaladin said, “and from what I’ve learned about the\nassassin’s initial attack on the old king, he depends on confusion in his"

He jumps off walls and onto ceilings; he sends men falling the\nwrong direction. Well, there aren’t any walls or ceilings out here.”\n“So he can just full-on fly,” Adolin said with a grimace.\n“Yes,” Kaladin said, pointing with a smile, “since we have, what is it,\nthree hundred archers with us?”\nKaladin had used his abilities effectively against Parshendi arrows, and\nso perhaps archers wouldn’t be able to kill the assassin. But he imagined it\nwould be hard for the man to fight with wave after wave of arrows flying at\nhim.\nAdolin nodded slowly. “I’ll talk to them, get them ready for the\npossibility.” He started walking toward the bridge, so Kaladin joined him.\nThey passed Shallan, who was still absorbed in her sketching. She didn’t\neven notice Adolin waving at her. Lighteyed women and their diversions.\nKaladin shook his head.\n“Do you know anything about women, bridgeboy?” Adolin asked,\nlooking over his shoulder and watching Shallan as the two of them crossed\nthe bridge.\n“Lighteyed women?” Kaladin asked. “Nothing. Thankfully.”\n“People think I know a lot about women,” Adolin said. “The truth is, I\nknow how to get them—how to make them laugh, how to make them\ninterested. I don’t know how to keep them.” He hesitated. “I really want to\nkeep this one.”\n“So… tell her that, maybe?” Kaladin said, thinking back to Tarah, and\nthe mistakes he’d made.\n“Do such things work on darkeyed women?”\n“You’re asking the wrong man,” Kaladin said. “I haven’t had much time\nfor women lately. I was too busy trying to avoid being killed.”\nAdolin seemed to be barely listening. “Perhaps I could say something\nlike that to her… Seems too simple, and she’s anything but simple…” He\nturned back to Kaladin. “Anyway. Assassin in White. We need more of a\nplan than just telling the archers to be ready.”\n“Do you have any ideas?” Kaladin said.\n“You won’t have a Shardblade, but won’t need one, because of… you\nknow.”\n“I know?” Kaladin felt a spike of alarm.\n“Yeah… you know.” Adolin glanced away and shrugged, as if trying to\nact nonchalant. “That thing.”\n“What thing?”\n“The thing… with the… um, stuff?”\nHe doesn’t know, Kaladin realized. He’s just fishing, trying to figure out\nwhy I can fight so well.\nAnd he’s doing a really, really bad job of it.\nKaladin relaxed, and even found himself smiling at Adolin’s awkward\nattempt. It was nice to feel an emotion other than panic or worry. “I don’t\nthink you have any idea what you’re talking about.”\nAdolin scowled. “There’s something odd about you, bridgeboy,” he\nsaid. “Admit it.”\n“I admit nothing.”\n“You survived that fall with the assassin,” Adolin said. “And at first, I\nworried you were working with him.

My instincts say the best plan is the one we\nused when fighting together in the arena. You distract him while I kill him.”\n“That could work, though I worry that he’s not the type to let himself\nget distracted.”\n“Neither was Relis,” Adolin said. “We’ll do it, bridgeboy. You and I.\nWe’re going to bring that monster down.”\n“We’ll need to be fast,” Kaladin said. “He’ll win a drawn-out fight. And\nAdolin, strike for the spine or the head. Don’t try a weakening blow first.\nGo right for the kill.”\nAdolin frowned at him. “Why?”\n“I saw something when the two of us fell together,” Kaladin said. “I cut\nhim, but he healed the wound somehow.”\n“I have a Blade. He won’t be able to heal from that… right?”\n“Best to not find out. Strike to kill. Trust me.”\nAdolin met his eyes. “Oddly, I do. Trust you, I mean. It’s a very strange\nsensation.”\n“Yeah, well, I’ll try to hold myself back from going skipping across the\nplateau in joy.”\nAdolin grinned. “I’d pay to see that.”\n“Me skipping?”\n“You happy,” Adolin said, laughing. “You’ve got a face like a storm! I\nhalf think you could frighten off a storm.”\nKaladin grunted.\nAdolin laughed again, slapping him on the shoulder, then turned as\nShallan finally crossed the bridge, her sketching apparently done. She\nlooked to Adolin fondly, and as he reached out to take her hand, she rose up\non her toes and gave him a kiss on the cheek. Adolin drew back, startled.\nAlethi were more reserved than that in public.\nShallan grinned at him. Then she turned and gasped, raising a hand to\nher mouth. Kaladin jumped, again, looking for danger—but Shallan just\nwent dashing off to a nearby clump of rocks.\nAdolin raised his hand to his cheek, then looked to Kaladin with a grin.\n“She probably saw an interesting bug.”\n“No, it’s moss!” Shallan called back.\n“Ah, of course,” Adolin said, strolling over, Kaladin following. “Moss.\nSo exciting.”\n“Hush, you,” Shallan said, wagging her pencil at him as she bent down,\ninspecting the rocks. “The moss grows in a strange pattern here. What could\ncause that?”\n“Alcohol,” Adolin said.\nShe glanced at him.\nHe shrugged. “Makes me do crazy things.” He looked at Kaladin, who\nshook his head. “That was funny,” Adolin said. “It was a joke! Well, kind\nof.”\n“Oh hush,” Shallan said. “This looks almost like the same pattern as a\nflowering rockbud, the kind common here on the Plains…” She started\nsketching.\nKaladin folded his arms. Then he sighed."

Then he sighed.\n“What does that sigh mean?” Adolin asked him.\n“Boredom,” Kaladin said, glancing back at the army, still crossing the\nbridge. With a force of three thousand—that was about half of Dalinar’s\ncurrent army, following heavy recruitment—moving out here took time. On\nbridge runs, these crossings had felt so quick. Kaladin had always been\nexhausted, savoring the chance to rest. “I guess out here, it’s so barren that\nthere’s not much to get excited about other than moss.”\n“You hush too,” Shallan told him. “Go polish your bridge or\nsomething.” She leaned in, then poked her pencil at a bug that was crawling\nacross the moss. “Ah…” she said, then hurriedly scribbled some notes.\n“Anyway, you’re wrong. There’s a lot out here to get excited about, if you\nlook in the right places. Some of the soldiers said a chasmfiend has been\nspotted. Do you think it might attack us?”\n“You sound entirely too hopeful saying that, Shallan,” Adolin said.\n“Well, I do still need a good sketch of one.”\n“We’ll get you to the chrysalis. That will have to be enough.”\nShallan’s scholarship was an excuse; the truth was obvious to Kaladin.\nDalinar had brought an unusual number of scouts with him today, and\nKaladin suspected once they reached the chrysalis—which was on the\nborder of unexplored lands—they’d range ahead and gather information.\nThis was all preparation for Dalinar’s expedition.\n“I don’t understand why we need so many soldiers,” Shallan said,\nnoticing Kaladin’s gaze as he studied the army. “Didn’t you say the\nParshendi haven’t been showing up to fight over chrysalises lately?”\n“No, they haven’t,” Adolin said. “That’s precisely what makes us\nworried.”\nKaladin nodded. “Whenever your enemy changes established tactics,\nyou need to worry. It could mean they’re getting desperate. Desperation is\nvery, very dangerous.”\n“You’re good at military thinking, for a bridgeboy,” Adolin said.\n“Coincidentally,” Kaladin said, “you’re good at not being unobnoxious,\nfor a prince.”\n“Thanks,” Adolin said.\n“That was an insult, dear,” Shallan said.\n“What?” Adolin said. “It was?”\nShe nodded, still sketching, though she glanced up to eye Kaladin. He\nmet the expression calmly.\n“Adolin,” Shallan said, turning back to the small rock formation in front\nof her, “would you slay this moss for me, please?”\n“Slay… the moss.” He looked at Kaladin, who just shrugged. How was\nhe to know what a lighteyed woman meant? They were a strange breed.\n“Yes,” Shallan said, standing up. “Give that moss, and the rock behind\nit, a good chop. As a favor for your betrothed.”\nAdolin looked baffled, but he did as she asked, summoning his\nShardblade and hacking at the moss and rock. The top of the small pile of\nstones slipped free, cut with ease, and clattered to the floor of the plateau."

She started\nsketching.\nAdolin dismissed his Blade. “Women!” he said, shrugging at Kaladin.\nThen he went jogging off to get a drink without asking her for an\nexplanation.\nKaladin took a step after him, but then hesitated. What did Shallan find\nso interesting here? This woman was a puzzle, and he knew he wouldn’t be\ncompletely comfortable until he understood her. She had too much access to\nAdolin, and therefore Dalinar, to leave uninvestigated.\nHe stepped closer, looking over her shoulder as she drew. “Strata,” he\nsaid. “You’re counting the strata of crem to guess how old the rock is.”\n“Good guess,” she said, “but this is a bad location for strata dating. The\nwind blows across the plateaus too strongly, and the crem doesn’t collect in\npools evenly. So the strata here are erratic and inaccurate.”\nKaladin frowned, narrowing his eyes. The cross section of rock was\nnormal cremstone on the outside, some strata visible as different shades of\nbrown. The center of the stone, though, was white. You didn’t see white\nrock like that often; it had to be quarried. Which meant this was either a\nvery strange occurrence, or…\n“There was a structure here once,” Kaladin said. “A long time ago. It\nmust have taken centuries for the crem to get that thick on something\nsticking out of the ground.”\nShe glanced at him. “You’re smarter than you look.” Then, turning back\nto her drawing, she added, “Good thing…”\nHe grunted. “Why does everything you say have to include some quip?\nAre you that desperate to prove how clever you are?”\n“Perhaps I’m merely annoyed at you for taking advantage of Adolin.”\n“Advantage?” Kaladin asked. “Because I called him obnoxious?”\n“You deliberately said it in a way you expected he wouldn’t understand.\nTo make him look like a fool. He’s trying very hard to be nice to you.”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said. “He’s always so munificent to all of the little\ndarkeyes who flock around to worship him.”\nShallan snapped her pencil against the page. “You really are a hateful\nman, aren’t you? Underneath the mock boredom, the dangerous glares, the\ngrowls—you just hate people, is that it?”\n“What? No, I—”\n“Adolin is trying. He feels bad for what happened to you, and he’s\ndoing what he can to make up for it. He is a good man. Is it too much for\nyou to stop provoking him?”\n“He calls me bridgeboy,” Kaladin said, feeling stubborn. “He’s been\nprovoking me.”\n“Yes, because he is the one storming around with alternating scowls and\ninsults,” Shallan said. “Adolin Kholin, the most difficult man to get along\nwith on the Shattered Plains. I mean look at him! He’s so unlikable!”"

It was ridiculously large on the lad.\nKaladin flushed as the boy took a Shardbearer’s pose, and they all\nlaughed again.

Bah!\nKaladin left her and hiked across the rough ground to join Bridge Four,\nwhere he insisted on taking a turn hauling the bridge, despite Teft’s protests\nthat he was “above that sort of thing” now. He was no storming lighteyes.\nHe’d never be above doing an honest day’s work.\nThe familiar weight of the bridge settled onto his shoulders. Rock was\nright. It did feel lighter than it once had. He smiled as he heard cursing from\nLopen’s cousins, who—like Renarin—were being initiated on this run into\ntheir first bridge carry.\nThey hiked the bridge over a chasm—crossing on one of Dalinar’s\nlarger, less mobile ones—and started across the plateau. For a time,\nmarching at the front of Bridge Four, Kaladin could imagine that his life\nwas simple. No plateau assaults, no arrows, no assassins or bodyguarding.\nJust him, his team, and a bridge.\nUnfortunately, as they neared the other side of the large plateau, he\nstarted to feel weary and—by reflex—tried to suck in some Stormlight to\nbolster him. It wouldn’t come.\nLife was not simple. It never had been, certainly not while running\nbridges. To pretend otherwise was to paint over the past.\nHe helped set the bridge down, then—noticing the vanguard moving out\nin front of the army—he and the bridgemen shoved their bridge into place\nacross the chasm. The vanguard cheerfully welcomed the chance to get\nahead, marching over the bridge and securing the next plateau.\nKaladin and the others followed, then—a half hour later—they let the\nvanguard onto the next plateau. They continued like that for a time, waiting\nfor Dalinar’s bridge to arrive before crossing, then leading the vanguard\nonto the next plateau. Hours passed—sweaty, muscle-straining hours. Good\nhours. Kaladin didn’t come to any realizations about the king, or his place\nin the man’s potential assassination. But for the moment, he carried his\nbridge and enjoyed the progress of an army moving toward their goal\nbeneath an open sky.\nAs the day grew long, they approached the target plateau, where the\nhollowed-out chrysalis awaited Shallan’s study. Kaladin and Bridge Four let\nthe vanguard across as they’d been doing, then settled in to wait.\nEventually, the bulk of the army approached, and Dalinar’s lumbering\nbridges moved into position, ratcheting down to span the chasm."

He washed his\nface with the water, then wiped his brow. They were getting close. This\nplateau was far out onto the Plains, almost to the Tower itself. Getting back\nwould take hours, assuming they moved at the same relaxed speed they had\ntaken getting out here. It would be well after dark when they returned to the\nwarcamps.\nIf Dalinar does want to assault the center of the Shattered Plains,\nKaladin thought, it will take days of marching, all the while exposed on the\nplateaus, with the potential of being surrounded and cut off from the\nwarcamps.\nThe Weeping would make a great chance for that. Four straight weeks of\nrain, but no highstorms. This was the off year, when there wouldn’t even be\na highstorm on Lightday in the middle—part of the thousand-day cycle of\ntwo years that made up a full storm rotation. Still, he knew that many Alethi\npatrols had tried exploring eastward before. They’d all been destroyed by\nhighstorms, chasmfiends, or Parshendi assault teams.\nNothing short of an all-out, full-on movement of resources toward the\ncenter would work. An assault that would leave Dalinar, and whoever came\nwith him, isolated.\nDalinar’s bridge thumped down into place. Kaladin’s men traversed\ntheir own bridge and prepared to pull it across to go move the vanguard.\nKaladin crossed, then waved them on ahead of him. He walked over to\nwhere the larger bridge had settled down.\nDalinar was crossing it while walking with some of his scouts, all\nvaulters, with servants behind carrying long poles. “I want you to spread\nout,” the highprince said to them. “We won’t have much time before we\nneed to head back. I want a survey of as many plateaus as you can see from\nhere. The more of our route we can plan now, the less time we’ll have to\nwaste during the actual assault.”\nThe scouts nodded, saluting as he dismissed them. He stepped off the\nbridge and nodded to Kaladin. Behind them, Dalinar’s generals, scribes, and\nengineers crossed the bridge. They’d be followed by the bulk of the army,\nand finally the rearguard.\n“I hear you’ve been building mobile bridges, sir,” Kaladin said. “You\nrealize those mechanical ones are too slow for your assault, I assume.”\nDalinar nodded. “But I will have soldiers carry them. No need for your\nmen to do so.”\n“Sir, that is thoughtful of you, but I don’t think you have to worry. The\nbridge crews will carry for you, if ordered. Many of them will probably\nwelcome the familiarity.”\n“I thought you and your men considered assignment to those bridge\ncrews a death sentence, soldier,” Dalinar said.\n“The way Sadeas ran them, it was. You could do a better job. Armored\nmen, trained in formations, running the bridges. Soldiers marching in front\nwith shields. Archers with instructions to defend the bridge crews. Besides,\nthe danger is only for an assault.”"

Besides,\nthe danger is only for an assault.”\nDalinar nodded. “Prepare the crews, then. Having your men on the\nbridges will free the soldiers in case we get attacked.” He started to walk\nacross the plateau, but one of the carpenters on the other side of the chasm\ncalled to him. Dalinar turned and started to cross the bridge again.\nHe passed officers and scribes crossing the bridge, including Adolin and\nShallan, who walked side by side. She’d given up on the palanquin and he\nhad given up on his horse, and she seemed to be explaining to him about the\nhidden remnants of a structure she’d found inside that rock earlier.\nBehind them, on the other side of the chasm, stood the worker who had\ncalled Dalinar back across.\nIt’s that same carpenter, Kaladin thought. The stout man with the cap\nand the birthmark. Where have I seen him… ?\nIt clicked. Sadeas’s lumberyards. The man had been one of the\ncarpenters there, overseeing the construction of bridges.\nKaladin started running.\nHe was charging toward the bridge before the connection fully\nsolidified in his mind. Ahead of him, Adolin spun immediately and started\nrunning, searching for whatever danger Kaladin had spotted. He left a\nbewildered Shallan standing in the bridge’s center. Kaladin approached her\nin a rush.\nThe carpenter grabbed a lever on the side of the bridge contraption.\n“The carpenter, Adolin!” Kaladin screamed. “Stop that man!”\nDalinar still stood on the bridge. The highprince had been distracted by\nsomething else. What? Kaladin realized he had heard something too. Horns,\nthe call that the enemy had been spotted.\nIt happened all in an instant. Dalinar turning toward the horns. The\ncarpenter pulling the lever, Adolin in his glimmering Shardplate reaching\nDalinar.\nThe bridge lurched.\nThen it collapsed.\n69. Nothing\nRayse is captive. He cannot leave the system\nhe now inhabits. His destructive potential is,\ntherefore, inhibited.\nAs the bridge fell out from beneath him, Kaladin reached for\nStormlight.\nNothing.\nPanic surged through him. His stomach dropped and he tumbled into the\nair.\nThe fall into the darkness of the chasm was a brief moment, but also an\neternity. He caught a glimpse of Shallan and several men in blue uniforms\nfalling and flailing in terror.\nLike a drowning man struggling toward the surface, Kaladin thrashed\nfor the Stormlight. He would not die this way! The sky was his! The winds\nwere his. The chasms were his.\nHe would not!\nSyl screamed, a terrified, painful sound that vibrated Kaladin’s very\nbones. In that moment, he got a breath of Stormlight, life itself.\nHe crashed into the ground at the bottom of the chasm and all went\nblack.\n* * *\nSwimming through pain.\nThe pain washed over him, a liquid, but did not get inside. His skin kept\nit out.\nWHAT HAVE YOU DONE? The distant voice sounded like rumbling\nthunder.\nKaladin gasped and opened his eyes, and the pain crawled inside."

The distant voice sounded like rumbling\nthunder.\nKaladin gasped and opened his eyes, and the pain crawled inside.\nSuddenly, his entire body hurt.\nHe lay on his back, staring upward at a streak of light in the air. Syl?\nNo… no, that was sunlight. The opening at the top of the chasm, high above\nhim. This far out onto the Shattered Plains, the chasms here were hundreds\nof feet deep.\nKaladin groaned and sat up. That strip of light seemed impossibly\ndistant. He’d been swallowed by the darkness, and the chasm nearby was\nshadowed, obscure. He put a hand to his head.\nI got some Stormlight right at the end, he thought. I survived. But that\nscream! It haunted him, echoing in his mind. It had sounded too much like\nthe scream he’d heard when touching the duelist’s Shardblade in the arena.\nCheck for wounds, his father’s teachings whispered from the back of his\nmind. The body could go into shock with a bad break or wound, and not\nnotice the damage that had been done. He went through the motions of\nchecking his limbs for breaks, and did not reach for any of the spheres in\nhis pouch. He didn’t want to light the gloom, and potentially face the dead\naround him.\nWas Dalinar among them? Adolin had been running toward his father.\nHad the prince managed to get to Dalinar before the bridge collapsed? He’d\nbeen wearing Plate, and had jumped at the end.\nKaladin felt at his legs, then his ribs. He found aches and scrapes, but\nnothing broken or ripped. That Stormlight he’d held at the end… it had\nprotected him, perhaps even healed him, before running out. He finally\nreached into his pouch and fished out spheres, but found those all drained.\nHe tried his pocket, then froze as he heard something scraping nearby.\nHe leaped to his feet and spun, wishing he had a weapon. The chasm\nbottom grew brighter. A steady glow revealed fanlike frillblooms and\ndraping vines on the walls, gathered twigs and moss on the floor in patches.\nWas that a voice? He felt a surreal moment of confusion as shadows moved\non the wall ahead of him.\nThen someone wandered around the corner, wearing a silk dress and\ncarrying a pack over her shoulder. Shallan Davar.\nShe screamed when she saw him, throwing the pack to the ground and\nstumbling backward, hands to her sides. She even dropped her sphere.\nRolling his arm in its socket, Kaladin stepped closer into the light.\n“Calm down,” he said. “It’s me.”\n“Stormfather!” Shallan said, scrambling to grab the sphere off the\nground again. She stepped forward, thrusting the light toward him. “It is\nyou… the bridgeman. How… ?”\n“I don’t know,” he lied, looking upward. “I’ve got a wicked crick in my\nneck and my elbow hurts like thunder. What happened?”\n“Someone threw the emergency latch on the bridge.”\n“What emergency latch?”\n“It topples the bridge into the chasm.”\n“Sounds like a storming stupid thing to have,” Kaladin said, fishing in\nhis pocket for his other spheres. He glanced at them covertly. Also drained."

Also drained.\nStorms. He’d used them all?\n“Depends,” Shallan said. “What if your men have retreated over the\nbridge and enemies are pouring across it after you? The emergency latch is\nsupposed to have some kind of safety lock so it can’t be thrown by accident,\nbut you can release it in a hurry if you need to.”\nHe grunted as Shallan shone her sphere past him toward where the two\nhalves of the bridge had smashed into the ground of the chasm. There were\nthe bodies he’d expected.\nHe looked. He had to. No sign of Dalinar, though several of the officers\nand lighteyed ladies who had been crossing the bridge lay in twisted,\nbroken heaps on the ground. A drop of two hundred feet or more did not\nleave survivors.\nExcept Shallan. Kaladin didn’t remember grabbing her as he fell, but he\ndidn’t remember much of that fall beyond Syl’s scream. That scream…\nWell, he must have managed to grab Shallan by reflex, infusing her with\nStormlight to slow her fall. She looked disheveled, her blue dress scuffed\nand her hair a mess, but she was apparently otherwise unharmed.\n“I woke up down here in the darkness,” Shallan said. “It’s been a while\nsince we fell.”\n“How can you tell?”\n“It’s almost dark up there,” Shallan said. “It will be night soon. When I\nwoke I heard echoes of yelling. Fighting. I saw something glowing from\naround that corner. Turned out to be a soldier who had fallen, his sphere\npouch ripped.” She shivered visibly. “He’d been killed by something before\nthe fall.”\n“Parshendi,” Kaladin said. “Just before the bridge collapsed, I heard\nhorns from the vanguard. We got attacked.” Damnation. That probably\nmeant that Dalinar had retreated, assuming he’d actually survived. There\nwas nothing worth fighting for out here.\n“Give me one of those spheres,” Kaladin said.\nShe handed one over, and Kaladin went searching among the fallen. For\npulses, ostensibly, but really for any equipment or spheres.\n“You think any of these might be alive?” Shallan asked, voice sounding\nsmall in the otherwise silent chasm.\n“Well, we survived somehow.”\n“How do you think that happened?” Shallan said, looking upward\ntoward the gap far, far above.\n“I saw some windspren just before we fell,” Kaladin said. “I’ve heard\nfolktales of them protecting a person as he falls. Perhaps that’s what\nhappened.”\nShallan went silent as he searched the bodies. “Yes,” she finally said.\n“That sounds logical.”\nShe seemed convinced. Good. So long as she didn’t start wondering\nabout the stories told of “Kaladin Stormblessed.”\nNobody else was alive, but he verified for certain that neither Dalinar\nnor Adolin were among the corpses.\nI was a fool not to spot that an assassination attempt was coming,\nKaladin thought. Sadeas had tried hard to undermine Dalinar at the feast a\nfew days back, with the revelation of the visions. It was a classic ploy."

It was a classic ploy.\nDiscredit your enemy, then kill him, to make certain he didn’t become a\nmartyr.\nThe corpses had little of value. A handful of spheres, some writing\nimplements that Shallan greedily snatched up and stuffed into her satchel.\nNo maps. Kaladin had no specific idea where they were. And with night\nimminent…\n“What do we do?” Shallan asked softly, staring at the darkened realm,\nwith its unexpected shadows, its gently moving frills, vines, polyplike\nstaccatos, their tendrils out and wafting in the air.\nKaladin remembered his first times down in this place, which always\nfelt too green, too muggy, too alien. Nearby, two skulls peeked out from\nbeneath the moss, watching. Splashing sounded from a distant pool, which\nmade Shallan spin wildly. Though the chasms were a home to Kaladin now,\nhe did not deny that at times they were distinctly unnerving.\n“It’s safer down here than it seems,” Kaladin said. “During my time in\nSadeas’s army, I spent days upon days in the chasms, gathering salvage\nfrom the fallen. Just watch for rotspren.”\n“And the chasmfiends?” Shallan asked, spinning to look in another\ndirection as a cremling scuttled along the wall.\n“I never saw one.” Which was true, though he had seen a shadow of one\nonce, scraping its way down a distant chasm. Even thinking of that day\ngave him chills. “They aren’t as common as people claim. The real danger\nis highstorms. You see, if it rains, even far away from here—”\n“Yes, flash flooding,” Shallan said. “Very dangerous in a slot canyon.\nI’ve read about them.”\n“I’m sure that will be very helpful,” Kaladin said. “You mentioned some\ndead soldiers nearby?”\nShe pointed, and he strode in that direction. She followed, sticking close\nto his light. He found a few dead spearmen who had been shoved off the\nplateau above. The wounds were fresh. Just beyond them was a dead\nParshendi, also fresh.\nThe Parshendi man had uncut gems in his beard. Kaladin touched one,\nhesitated, then tried to draw the Stormlight out. Nothing happened. He\nsighed, then bowed his head for the fallen, before finally pulling a spear\nfrom underneath one of the bodies and standing up. The light above had\nfaded to a deep blue. Night.\n“So, we wait?” Shallan asked.\n“For what?” Kaladin asked, raising the spear to his shoulder.\n“For them to come back…” She trailed off. “They’re not coming back\nfor us, are they?”\n“They’ll assume we’re dead. Storms, we should be dead. We’re too far\nout for a corpse-recovery operation, I’d guess. That’s doubly true since the\nParshendi attacked.” He rubbed his chin. “I suppose we could wait for\nDalinar’s major expedition. He was indicating he’d come this way,\nsearching for the center. It’s only a few days away, right?”"

That light skin of hers was so\nstrange. It and the red hair made her look like a very small Horneater.\n“Dalinar is planning to march just after the final highstorm before the\nWeeping. That storm is close. And it will involve lots, and lots, and lots of\nrain.”\n“Bad idea, then.”\n“You could say so.”\nHe’d tried to imagine what a highstorm would be like down here. He\nhad seen the aftereffects when salvaging with Bridge Four. The twisted,\nbroken corpses. The piles of refuse crushed against walls and into cracks.\nBoulders as tall as a man casually washed through chasms until they got\nwedged between two walls, sometimes fifty feet up in the air.\n“When?” he asked. “When is that highstorm?”\nShe stared at him, then dug into her satchel, flipping through sheets of\npaper with her freehand while holding the satchel through the fabric of her\nsafehand. She waved him over with his sphere, as she had to tuck hers\naway.\nHe held it up for her as she looked over a page with lines of script.\n“Tomorrow night,” she said softly. “Just after first moonset.”\nKaladin grunted, holding up his sphere and inspecting the chasm. We’re\njust to the north of the chasm we fell from, he thought. So the way back\nshould be… that way?\n“All right then,” Shallan said. She took a deep breath, then snapped her\nsatchel closed. “We walk back, and we start immediately.”\n“You don’t want to sit for a moment and catch your breath?”\n“My breath is quite well caught,” Shallan said. “If it’s all the same to\nyou, I’d rather be moving. Once back, we can sit sipping mulled wine and\nlaugh about how silly it was of us to hurry all that way, since we had so\nmuch time to spare. I’d like very much to feel that foolish. You?”\n“Yeah.” He liked the chasms. It didn’t mean he wanted to risk a\nhighstorm in one of them. “You don’t have a map in that satchel, do you?”\n“No,” Shallan said with a grimace. “I didn’t bring my own. Brightness\nVelat has the maps. I was using hers. But I might be able to remember some\nof what I’ve seen.”\n“Then I think we should go this way,” Kaladin said, pointing.

At least he was superstitious enough to believe that he’d been\nsaved by some twist of fate and spren. She had no idea how she’d saved\nherself, let alone him. Pattern rode on her skirts, and before she’d found the\nbridgeman, he’d been speculating that the Stormlight had kept her alive.\nAlive after a fall of at least two hundred feet? It only proved how little\nshe knew about her abilities. Stormfather! She’d saved this man too. She\nwas sure of it; he’d been falling right beside her as they plummeted.\nBut how? And could she figure out how to do it again?\nShe hurried to keep up with him. Blasted Alethi and their freakishly\nlong legs. He marched like a soldier, giving no thought to how she had to\npick her way more carefully than he did. She didn’t want to get her skirt\ncaught on every branch they passed.\nThey reached a pool of water on the chasm floor, and he hopped up onto\na log that bridged the water, barely breaking stride as he crossed. She\nstopped at the edge.\nHe looked back at her, holding up a sphere. “You aren’t going to\ndemand I give you my boots again, are you?”\nShe raised a foot, revealing the military-style boots she wore underneath\nher dress. That got him to cock an eyebrow.\n“I wasn’t about to come out onto the Shattered Plains in slippers,” she\nsaid, blushing. “Besides, nobody can see your shoes under a dress this\nlong.” She regarded the log.\n“You want me to help you across?” he asked.\n“Actually, I’m wondering how the trunk of a stumpweight tree got\nhere,” she confessed. “They can’t possibly be native to this area of the\nShattered Plains. Too cold out here. It might have grown along the coast,\nbut a highstorm really carried it that far? Four hundred miles?”\n“You’re not going to demand we stop for you to sketch a picture, are\nyou?”\n“Oh please,” Shallan said, stepping up onto the log and picking her way\nacross. “Do you know how many sketches I have of stumpweights?”\nThe other things down here were a different matter entirely. As they\ncontinued on their way, Shallan used her sphere—which she had to juggle\nin her freehand, trying to manage it along with the satchel in her safehand\nand the pack over her shoulder—to illuminate her surroundings. They were\nstunning. Dozens of different varieties of vines, frillblooms of red, orange,\nand violet. Tiny rockbuds on the walls, and haspers in little clusters,\nopening and closing their shells as if breathing.\nMotes of lifespren drifted around a patch of shalebark that grew in\nknobby patterns like fingers. You almost never saw that formation above.\nThe tiny glowing specks of green light drifted through the chasm toward an\nentire wall of fist-size tube plants with little feelers wiggling out the top. As\nShallan passed, the feelers retracted in a wave running up the wall. She\ngasped softly and took a Memory.\nThe bridgeman stopped ahead of her, turning. “Well?”"

She was certain she’d read\nabout those somewhere, but the name escaped her.\nThe bridgeman continued on his way.\nShallan jogged after him, pack thumping against her back. She almost\ntripped over a snarled pile of dead vines and sticks as she reached him. She\ncursed, hopping on one foot to stay upright before steadying herself.\nHe reached out and took the pack from her.\nFinally, she thought. “Thank you.”\nHe grunted, slipping it over his shoulder before continuing on without\nanother word. They reached a crossroads in the chasms, a path going right\nand another going left. They’d have to weave around the next plateau\nbefore them to continue westward. Shallan looked up at the rift—getting a\ngood picture in her mind of how this side of the plateau looked—as Kaladin\nchose one of the paths.\n“This is going to take a while,” he said. “Even longer than it took to get\nout here. We had to wait upon the whole army then, but we could also cut\nthrough the centers of the plateaus. Having to go around every one of them\nwill add a lot to the trip.”\n“Well, at least the companionship is pleasant.”\nHe eyed her.\n“For you, I mean,” she added.\n“Am I going to have to listen to you prattle all the way back?”\n“Of course not,” she said. “I also intend to do some blathering, a little\nnattering, and the occasional gibber. But not too much, lest I overdo a good\nthing.”\n“Great.”\n“I’ve been practicing my burble,” she added.\n“I just can’t wait to hear.”\n“Oh, well, that was it, actually.”\nHe studied her, those severe eyes of his boring into her own. She turned\naway from him. He didn’t trust her, obviously. He was a bodyguard; she\ndoubted that he trusted many people.\nThey reached another intersection, and Kaladin took longer to make this\ndecision. She could see why—down here, it was difficult to determine\nwhich way was which. The plateau formations were varied and erratic.\nSome were long and thin, others almost perfectly round. They had knobs\nand peninsulas off to their sides, and that made a maze of the twisted paths\nbetween them. It should have been easy—there were few dead ends, after\nall, and so they really just had to keep moving westward.\nBut which direction was westward? It would be very, very easy to get\nlost down here.\n“You’re not picking our course at random, are you?” she asked.\n“No.”\n“You seem to know a lot about these chasms.”\n“I do.”\n“Because the gloomy atmosphere matches your disposition, I assume.”\nHe kept his eyes forward, walking without comment.\n“Storms,” she said, hurrying to catch up. “That was supposed to be\nlighthearted. What would it take to make you relax, bridgeboy?”\n“I guess I’m just a… what was it again? A ‘hateful man’?”"

Could it be that\npeople don’t like you, not because you’re darkeyed, but because you’re just\na huge pain in the neck?”\nHe snorted, then moved on more quickly.\n“No,” Shallan said, practically running to keep even with him and his\nlong stride. “You’re not wiggling out of this. You don’t get to imply that I’m\nabusing my station, then walk off without a response. You did this earlier,\nwith Adolin. Now with me. What is your problem?”\n“You want a better example of you playing with people beneath you?”\nKaladin asked, dodging her question. “Fine. You stole my boots. You\npretended to be someone you weren’t and bullied a darkeyed guard you’d\nbarely met. Is that a good enough example of you playing with someone\nyou saw as beneath you?”\nShe stopped in her tracks. He was right, there. She wanted to blame\nTyn’s influence, but his comment cut the bite out of her argument.\nHe stopped ahead of her, looking back. Finally, he sighed. “Look,” he\nsaid. “I’m not holding a grudge about the boots. From what I’ve seen lately,\nyou’re not as bad as the others. So let’s just leave it at that.”\n“Not as bad as the others?” Shallan said, walking forward. “What a\ndelightful compliment. Well, let’s say you’re right. Perhaps I am an\ninsensitive rich woman. That doesn’t change the fact that you can be\ndownright mean and offensive, Kaladin Stormblessed.”\nHe shrugged."

I can’t say anything to change the way you treat me, can\nI? You’re just going to continue to be an intolerant, odious man, full of\nspite. Incapable of being pleasant around others. Your life must be very\nlonely.”\nThat seemed to get under his skin, as his face turned red in the\nspherelight. “I’m starting to revise my opinion,” he said, “of you not being\nas bad as the others.”\n“Don’t lie,” she said. “You’ve never liked me. Right from the start. And\nnot just because of the boots. I see how you watch me.”\n“That’s because,” he said, “I know you’re lying through your smile at\neveryone you meet. The only time you seem honest is when you’re\ninsulting someone!”\n“The only honest things I can say to you are insults.”\n“Bah!” he said. “I just… Bah! Why is it that being around you makes\nme want to claw my face off, woman?”\n“I have special training,” she said, glancing to the side. “And I collect\nfaces.” What was that?\n“You can’t just—”\nHe cut off as the scraping noise, echoing from one of the chasms, grew\nlouder.\nKaladin immediately put his hand over his improvised sphere lantern,\nplunging them into darkness. In Shallan’s estimation, that did not help. She\nstumbled toward him in the darkness, grabbing his arm with her freehand.\nHe was annoying, but he was also there.\nThe scraping continued. A sound like rock on rock. Or… carapace on\nrock.\n“I guess,” she whispered nervously, “having a shouting match in an\nechoing network of chasms was not terribly wise.”\n“Yeah.”\n“It’s getting closer, isn’t it?” she whispered.\n“Yeah.”\n“So… run?”\nThe scraping seemed just beyond the next turn.\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said, pulling his hand off his spheres and charging\naway from the noise.\nShallan’s Sketchbook: Chasm Life\n70.

At the next\nintersection, he only paused long enough to check to see if they were being\nfollowed.\nThey were. Thumping from behind them, claws on stone. Scraping. He\ngrabbed the girl’s satchel—he was already carrying her pack—as they ran\ndown another corridor. Either Shallan was in excellent shape, or the panic\ngot to her, because she didn’t even seem winded when they reached the next\nintersection.\nNo time for hesitation. He barreled down a pathway, ears full of the\nsound of grinding carapace. A sudden four-voiced trump echoed through the\nchasm, as loud as a thousand horns being blown. Shallan screamed, though\nKaladin barely heard her over the horrible sound.\nThe chasm plants withdrew in large waves. In moments, the entire place\nwent from fecund to barren, like the world preparing for a highstorm. They\nhit another intersection, and Shallan hesitated, looking back toward the\nsounds. She held her hands out, as if preparing to embrace the thing.\nStorming woman! He grabbed her and pulled her after him. They ran down\ntwo chasms without stopping.\nIt was still chasing, though he could only hear it. He had no idea how\nclose it was, but it had their scent. Or their sound? He had no idea how they\nhunted.\nNeed a plan! Can’t just—\nAt the next intersection, Shallan turned the opposite way from the one\nhe had picked. Kaladin cursed, pounding to a stop and running after her.\n“This is no time,” he said, puffing, “to argue about—”\n“Shut it,” she said. “Follow.”\nShe led them to an intersection, then another. Kaladin was feeling\nwinded, his lungs protesting. Shallan stopped, then pointed and ran down a\nchasm. He followed, looking over his shoulder.\nHe could see only blackness. Moonlight was too distant, too choked, to\nilluminate these depths. They wouldn’t know if the beast was upon them\nuntil it entered the light of his spheres. But Stormfather, it sounded close.\nKaladin turned his attention back to his running. He nearly tripped over\nsomething on the ground. A corpse? He leaped it, catching up to Shallan.\nThe hem of her dress was snarled and ripped from the running, her hair a\nmess, her face flushed. She led them down another corridor, then slowed to\na stop, hand to the wall of the chasm, puffing.\nKaladin closed his eyes, breathing in and out. Can’t rest long. It will be\ncoming. He felt as if he were going to collapse.\n“Cover that light,” Shallan hissed.\nHe frowned at her, but did so. “We can’t rest long,” he hissed back.\n“Quiet.”\nThe darkness was complete save for the thin light escaping between his\nfingers. The scraping seemed almost on top of them. Storms! Could he fight\none of these monsters? Without Stormlight?

He prepared to run, but…\nThe sounds didn’t seem to be getting closer anymore. Kaladin frowned.\nThe body he’d stumbled over, it had been one of the fallen from the fight\nearlier. Shallan had led them back to where they’d started.\nAnd… to food for the beast.\nHe waited, tense, listening to his heartbeat thumping in his chest.\nScraping echoed in the chasm. Oddly, some light flashed in the chasm\nbehind. What was that?\n“Stay here,” Shallan whispered.\nThen, incredibly, she started to move toward the sounds. Still holding\nthe spheres awkwardly with one hand, he reached out with the other and\nsnatched her.\nShe turned back to him, then looked down. Inadvertently, he’d grabbed\nher by the safehand. He let go immediately.\n“I have to see it,” Shallan whispered to him. “We’re so close.”\n“Are you insane?”\n“Probably.” She continued toward the beast.\nKaladin debated, cursing her in his mind. Finally, he put his spear down\nand dropped her pack and satchel over its spheres to muffle the light. Then\nhe followed. What else could he do? Explain to Adolin? Yes, princeling. I\nlet your betrothed wander off alone in the darkness to get eaten by a\nchasmfiend. No, I didn’t go with her. Yes, I’m a coward.\nThere was light ahead. It showed Shallan—her outline, at least—\ncrouching beside a turn in the chasm, peeking around. Kaladin stepped up\nto her, crouching down and taking a look.\nThere it was.\nThe beast filled the chasm. Long and narrow, it wasn’t bulbous or bulky,\nlike some small cremlings. It was sinuous, sleek, with that arrowlike face\nand sharp mandibles.\nIt was also wrong. Wrong in a way difficult to describe. Big creatures\nwere supposed to be slow and docile, like chulls. Yet this enormous beast\nmoved with ease, its legs up on the sides of the chasm, holding it so that its\nbody barely touched the ground. It ate the corpse of a fallen soldier,\ngrasping the body in smaller claws by its mouth, then ripping it in half with\na gruesome bite.\nThat face was like something from a nightmare. Evil, powerful, almost\nintelligent.\n“Those spren,” Shallan whispered, so soft he could barely hear. “I’ve\nseen those…”\nThey danced around the chasmfiend, and were the source of the light.\nThey looked like small glowing arrows, and they surrounded the beast in\nschools, though occasionally one would drift away from the others and then\nvanish like a small plume of smoke rising into the air.\n“Skyeels,” Shallan whispered. “They follow skyeels too. The\nchasmfiend likes corpses. Could its kind be carrion feeders by nature? No,\nthose claws, they look like they’re meant for breaking shells. I suspect we’d\nfind herds of wild chulls near where these things live naturally. But they\ncome to the Shattered Plains to pupate, and here there’s very little food,"

Why has this one remained after pupating?”\nThe chasmfiend was almost done with its meal. Kaladin took her by the\nshoulder, and she allowed him—with obvious reluctance—to pull her away.\nThey returned to their things, gathered them up, and—as silently as\npossible—retreated farther into the darkness.\n* * *\nThey walked for hours, going in a completely different direction from\nthe one they’d taken before. Shallan allowed Kaladin to lead again, though\nshe tried her best to keep track of the chasms. She’d need to draw it out to\nbe certain of their location.\nImages of the chasmfiend tumbled in her head. What a majestic animal!\nHer fingers practically itched to sketch it from the Memory she’d taken.\nThe legs were larger than she’d imagined; not like a legger, with spindly\nlittle spinelike legs holding up a thick body. This creature had exuded\npower. Like the whitespine, only enormous and more alien.\nThey were far from it now. Hopefully that meant they were safe. The\nnight was dragging on her, after she’d risen early to get moving on the\nexpedition.\nShe covertly checked the spheres in her pouch. She’d drained them all\ndun in their flight. Bless the Almighty for the Stormlight—she would need\nto make a glyphward in thanks. Without the strength and endurance it lent,\nshe’d never have been able to keep up with Kaladin longlegs.\nNow, however, she was storming exhausted. As if the Light had inflated\nher capacity, but now left her deflated and worn out.\nAt the next intersection, Kaladin paused and looked her over.\nShe gave him a weak smile.\n“We’ll need to stop for the night,” he said.\n“Sorry.”\n“It’s not just you,” he said, looking up at the sky. “I honestly have no\nidea if we’re going the right direction or not. I’m all turned around. If we\ncan get an idea in the morning of where the sun is rising, it will tell us\nwhich direction to walk.”\nShe nodded.\n“We should still be able to get back in plenty of time,” he added. “No\nneed to worry.”\nThe way he said it immediately made her start worrying. Still, she\nhelped him find a relatively dry portion of ground, and they settled down,\nspheres in the center like a little mock fire. Kaladin dug in the pack she’d\nfound—she’d taken it off a dead soldier—and came out with some rations\nof flatbread and dried chull jerky. Not the most appetizing of food by any\nstretch, but it was something.\nShe sat with her back to the wall and ate, looking upward. The flatbread\nwas from Soulcast grain—that stale taste was obvious. Clouds above\nprevented her from seeing the stars, but some starspren moved in front of\nthose, forming distant patterns.\n“It’s strange,” she whispered as Kaladin ate. “I’ve only been down here\nhalf a night, but it feels like so much longer. The tops of the plateaus seem\nso distant, don’t they?”\nHe grunted."

A language unto itself. I’ll\nneed to go over the morphemes and tones with you; I’m not quite fluent\nyet.”\n“You’d make a terrible bridgeman.”\n“Too short?”\n“Well, yes. And too female. I doubt you’d look good in the traditional\nshort trousers and open vest. Or, rather, you’d probably look too good. It\nmight be a little distracting for the other bridgemen.”\nShe smiled at that, digging into her satchel and pulling out her\nsketchbook and pencils. At least she had fallen with those. She started\nsketching, humming softly to herself and stealing one of the spheres for\nlight. Pattern still lay on her skirts, content to be silent in Kaladin’s\npresence.\n“Storms,” Kaladin said. “You’re not drawing a picture of you wearing\none of those outfits…”\n“Yes, of course,” she said. “I’m drawing salacious pictures of myself for\nyou after only a few hours together in the chasm.” She scratched at a line.\n“You have quite the imagination, bridgeboy.”\n“Well it’s what we were talking about,” he grumbled, rising and walking\nover to look at what she was doing. “I thought you were tired.”\n“I’m exhausted,” she said. “So I need to relax.” Obviously. This first\nsketch wouldn’t be the chasmfiend. She needed a warm-up.\nSo she drew their path through the chasms. A map, kind of, but more a\npicture of the chasms as if she could see them from above. It was\nimaginative enough to be interesting, though she was certain she got a few\nof the ridges and corners wrong.\n“What is that?” Kaladin asked. “A picture of the Plains?”\n“Something of a map,” she said, though she grimaced. What did it say\nabout her that she couldn’t just draw a few lines giving their location, like a\nregular person? She had to do it like a picture. “I don’t know the full shapes\nof the plateaus we walked around, just the chasm pathways we used.”\n“You remember it that well?”\nStormwinds. Hadn’t she intended to keep her visual memory more\nsecret than this? “Uh… No, not really. I’m guessing at a lot of this.”\nShe felt foolish for revealing her skill. Veil would have had words with\nher. It was too bad Veil wasn’t down here, actually. She would be better at\nthis whole surviving-in-the-wilderness thing.\nKaladin took the picture from her fingers, standing up and using his\nsphere to light it. “Well, if your map is correct, we’ve been making our way\nsouthward instead of westward. I need light to navigate better.”\n“Perhaps,” she said, taking out another sheet to begin her sketch of the\nchasmfiend.\n“We’ll wait for the sun tomorrow,” he said. “That will tell me which\nway to go.”\nShe nodded, beginning her sketch as he made a place for himself and\nsettled down, coat folded into a pillow. She wanted to turn in herself, but\nthis sketch would not wait. She at least had to get something down."

Shallan groaned, rolling over on the chasm floor, and drowsily tried\nto put her pillow over her head.\nWhich, of course, spilled dried chull meat onto her. Kaladin chuckled.\nSure, that got a laugh out of him. Storming man. How long had she\nbeen able to sleep? She blinked bleary eyes and focused on the open crack\nof the chasm far above.\nNope, not a single glimmer of light. Two, perhaps three hours of sleep,\nthen? Or, rather, “sleep.” The definition of what she’d done was debatable.\nShe’d probably have called it “tossing and turning on the rocky ground,\noccasionally waking with a start to find that she’d drooled a small puddle.”\nThat didn’t really roll off the tongue, though. Unlike the aforementioned\ndrool.\nShe sat up and stretched sore limbs, checking to make sure her sleeve\nhadn’t come unbuttoned in the night or anything equally embarrassing. “I\nneed a bath,” she grumbled.\n“A bath?” Kaladin asked. “You have only been away from civilization\nfor one day.”\nShe sniffed. “Just because you’re accustomed to the stench of unwashed\nbridgeman does not mean I need to join in.”\nHe smirked, taking a piece of dried chull meat from her shoulder and\npopping it in his mouth. “In my home town growing up, bath day was once\na week. I think even the local lighteyes would have found it strange that\neveryone out here, even the common soldiers, finds a bath more\nfrequently.”\nHow dare he be this chipper in the morning? Or, rather, the “morning.”\nShe threw another piece of chull meat at him when he wasn’t looking. The\nstorming man caught it.\nI hate him.\n“We didn’t get eaten by that chasmfiend while we slept,” he said,\nrefilling the pack save for a single waterskin. “I’d say that was about as\nmuch a blessing as we could expect, under the circumstances. Come on, up\non your toes. Your map gives me an idea of which way to go, and we can\nwatch for sunlight to make certain we’re on the right path. We want to beat\nthat highstorm, right?”\n“You’re the one I want to beat,” she grumbled. “With a stick.”\n“What was that?”\n“Nothing,” she said, standing up and trying to make something of her\nfrazzled hair. Storms. She must look like the aftereffect of a lightning bolt\nhitting a jar of red ink. She sighed.

Food didn’t\nsound good, so she let it growl. Serves it right, she thought. Whatever that\nmeant.\nEventually, the sky did start to brighten, and from a direction that\nindicated that they were going the right way. Kaladin fell into his customary\nquiet, and his chipper mien from earlier in the morning evaporated. Instead,\nhe looked like he was consumed by difficult thoughts.\nShe yawned, pulling up beside him. “What are you thinking about?”\n“I was considering how nice it was to have a little silence,” he said.\n“With nobody bothering me.”\n“Liar. Why do you try so hard to put people off?”\n“Maybe I just don’t want to have another argument.”\n“You won’t,” she said, yawning again. “It’s far too early for arguments.\nTry it. Give me an insult.”\n“I don’t—”\n“Insult! Now!”\n“I’d rather walk these chasms with a compulsive murderer than you. At\nleast then, when the conversation got tedious, I’d have an easy way out.”\n“And your feet stink,” she said. “See? Too early. I can’t possibly be\nwitty at this hour. So no arguments.” She hesitated, then continued more\nsoftly. “Besides, no murderer would agree to accompany you. Everyone\nneeds to have some standards, after all.”\nKaladin snorted, lips tugging up to the sides.\n“Be careful,” she said, hopping over a fallen log. “That was almost like\na smile—and earlier this morning, I could swear that you were cheerful.\nWell, mildly content. Anyway, if you start to be in a better mood, it will\ndestroy the whole variety of this trip.”\n“Variety?” he asked.\n“Yes. If we’re both pleasant, there’s no artistry to it. You see, great art is\na matter of contrast. Some lights and some darks. The happy, smiling,\nradiant lady and the dark, brooding, malodorous bridgeman.”\n“That—” He stopped. “Malodorous?”\n“A great figure painting,” she said, “shows the hero with inherent\ncontrast—strong, yet hinting at vulnerability, so that the viewer can relate to\nhim. Your little problem would make for a dynamic contrast.”\n“How would you even convey that in a painting?” Kaladin said,\nfrowning. “Besides, I’m not malodorous.”\n“Oh, so you’re getting better? Yay!”\nHe looked at her, dumbfounded.\n“Confusion,” she said. “I will graciously take that as a sign that you’re\namazed that I can be so humorous at such an early hour.” She leaned in\nconspiratorially, whispering. “I’m really not very witty. You just happen to\nbe stupid, so it seems that way. Contrast, remember?”\nShe smiled at him, then continued on her way, humming to herself."

Why had she been in a bad\nmood earlier?\nKaladin jogged to catch up with her. “Storms, woman,” he said. “I don’t\nknow what to make of you.”\n“Preferably not a corpse.”\n“I’m surprised someone hasn’t already done that.” He shook his head.\n“Give me an honest answer. Why are you here?”\n“Well, there was this bridge that collapsed, and I fell…”\nHe sighed.\n“Sorry,” Shallan said. “Something about you encourages me to crack\nwise, bridgeboy. Even in the morning. Anyway, why did I come here? You\nmean to the Shattered Plains in the first place?”\nHe nodded. There was a sort of rugged handsomeness to the fellow.\nLike the beauty of a natural rock formation, as opposed to a fine sculpture\nlike Adolin.\nBut Kaladin’s intensity, that frightened her. He seemed like a man who\nconstantly had his teeth clenched, a man who couldn’t let himself—or\nanyone else—just sit down and take a nice rest.\n“I came here,” Shallan said, “because of Jasnah Kholin’s work. The\nscholarship she left behind must not be abandoned.”\n“And Adolin?”\n“Adolin is a delightful surprise.”\nThey passed an entire wall covered in draping vines that were rooted in\na broken section of rock above. They wriggled and pulled up as Shallan\npassed. Very alert, she noted. Faster than most vines. These were the\nopposite of those in the gardens back home, where the plants had been\nsheltered for so long. She tried to snatch one for a cutting, but it moved too\nquickly.\nDrat. She needed a bit of one so that when they got back, she could\ngrow a plant for experimentation. Pretending she was here to explore and\nrecord new species helped push back the gloom. She heard Pattern\nhumming softly from her skirt, as if he realized what she was doing,\ndistracting herself from the predicament and the danger. She swatted at him.\nWhat would the bridgeman think if he heard her clothing buzz?\n“Just a moment,” she said, finally snatching one of the vines. Kaladin\nwatched, leaning on his spear, as she cut the tip off the vine with the small\nknife from her satchel.\n“Jasnah’s research,” he said. “It had something to do with structures\nhidden out here, beneath the crem?”\n“What makes you say that?” She tucked the tip of the vine away in an\nempty ink jar she’d kept for specimens.\n“You made too much of an effort to get out here,” he said. “Ostensibly\nall to investigate a chasmfiend’s chrysalis. A dead one, even. There has to\nbe more.”\n“You don’t understand the compulsive nature of scholarship, I see.” She\nshook the jar.\nHe snorted. “If you’d really wanted to see a chrysalis, you could have\njust had them tow one back for you.

There was no need for you to\ncome all the way out here yourself.”\nBlast. A solid argument. It was a good thing Adolin hadn’t thought of\nthat. The prince was wonderful, and he certainly wasn’t stupid, but he was\nalso… mentally direct.\nThis bridgeman was proving himself different. The way he watched her,\nthe way he thought. Even, she realized, the way he spoke. He talked like an\neducated lighteyes. But what of those slave brands on his forehead? The\nhair got in the way, but she thought that one of them was a shash brand.\nPerhaps she should spend as much time wondering about this man’s\nmotives as he apparently fretted about hers.\n“Riches,” he said, as they continued on. He held back some dead\nbranches sticking from a crack so she could pass. “There’s a treasure of\nsome sort out here, and that’s what you seek? But… no. You could have\nwealth easily enough by marriage.”\nShe didn’t say anything, stepping through the gap he made for her.\n“Nobody had heard of you before this,” he continued. “The Davar house\nreally does have a daughter your age, and you match the description. You\ncould be an impostor, but you’re actually lighteyed, and that Veden house\nisn’t particularly significant. If you were going to bother to impersonate\nsomeone, wouldn’t you pick someone more important?”\n“You seem to have thought about this a great deal.”\n“It’s my job.”\n“I’m being truthful with you—Jasnah’s research is why I came to the\nShattered Plains. I think the world itself could be in danger.”\n“That’s why you talked to Adolin about the parshmen.”\n“Wait. How do you… Your guards were there on that terrace with us.\nThey told you? I didn’t realize they were close enough to listen.”\n“I made a point of telling them to stay close,” Kaladin said. “At the\ntime, I was half convinced you were here to assassinate Adolin.”\nWell, he was nothing if not honest. And blunt.\n“My men said,” Kaladin continued, “that you seemed to want to get the\nparshmen murdered.”\n“I said nothing of the sort,” she said. “Though I am worried that they\nmight betray us. It’s a moot point, as I doubt I’ll persuade the highprinces\nwithout more evidence.”\n“If you got your way, though,” Kaladin said, sounding curious, “what\nwould you do? About the parshmen.”\n“Have them exiled,” Shallan said.\n“And who will replace them?” Kaladin said. “Darkeyes?”\n“I’m not saying it would be easy,” Shallan said.\n“They’d need more slaves,” Kaladin said, contemplative. “A lot of\nhonest men might find themselves with brands.”\n“Still sore about what happened to you, I assume.”\n“Wouldn’t you be?”\n“Yes, I suppose I would. I am sorry that you were treated in such a way,\nbut it could have been worse. You could have been hanged.”\n“I wouldn’t have wanted to be the executioner who tried that.” He said\nit with a quiet intensity."

You could have been hanged.”\n“I wouldn’t have wanted to be the executioner who tried that.” He said\nit with a quiet intensity.\n“Me neither,” Shallan said. “I think hanging people is a poor choice of\nprofessions for an executioner. Better to be the guy with an axe.”\nHe frowned at her.\n“You see,” she said, “with the axe, it’s easier to get ahead…”\nHe stared. Then, after a moment, he winced. “Oh, storms. That was\nawful.”\n“No, it was funny. You seem to get those two mixed up a lot. Don’t\nworry. I’m here to help.”\nHe shook his head. “It’s not that you aren’t witty, Shallan. I just feel like\nyou try too hard. The world is not a sunny place, and frantically trying to\nturn everything into a joke is not going to change that.”\n“Technically,” she said, “it is a sunny place. Half the time.”\n“To people like you, perhaps,” Kaladin said.\n“What does that mean?”\nHe grimaced. “Look, I don’t want to fight again, all right? I just…\nPlease. Let’s let the topic drop.”\n“What if I promise not to get angry?”\n“Are you capable of that?”\n“Of course. I spend most of my time not being angry. I’m terribly\nproficient at it. Most of those times aren’t around you, granted, but I think\nI’ll be all right.”\n“You’re doing it again,” he said.\n“Sorry.”\nThey walked in silence for a moment, passing plants in bloom with a\nshockingly well-preserved skeleton underneath them, somehow barely\ndisturbed by the flowing of water in the chasm.\n“All right,” Kaladin said. “Here it is. I can imagine how the world must\nappear to someone like you. Growing up pampered, with everything you\nwant. To someone like you, life is wonderful and sunny and worth laughing\nover. That’s not your fault, and I shouldn’t blame you. You haven’t had to\ndeal with pain or death like I have. Sorrow is not your companion.”\nSilence. Shallan didn’t reply. How could she reply to that?\n“What?” Kaladin finally asked.\n“I’m trying to decide how to react,” Shallan said. “You see, you just\nsaid something very, very funny.”\n“Then why aren’t you laughing?”\n“Well, it isn’t that kind of funny.” She handed him her satchel and\nstepped onto a small dry rise of rock running through the middle of a deep\npond on the chasm floor. The ground was usually flat—all of that crem\nsettling—but the water in this pool looked a good two or three feet deep.\nShe crossed with hands out to the sides, balancing. “So, let me see,” she\nsaid as she stepped carefully. “You think I’ve lived a simple, happy life full\nof sunshine and joy. But you also imply that I’ve got dark, evil secrets, so\nyou’re suspicious of and even hostile to me. You tell me I’m arrogant and\nassume that I consider darkeyes to be playthings, but when I tell you what\nI’m trying to do to protect them—and everyone else—you imply I’m\nmeddling and should just leave well enough alone.”"

I suppose.”\n“Wow,” she said, “you sure do seem to know me well. Particularly\nconsidering that you started this conversation by professing that you don’t\nknow what to make of me. An odd statement from someone who seems,\nfrom my perspective, to have figured it all out. Next time I’m trying to\ndecide what to do, I’ll just ask you, since you appear to understand me\nbetter than I understand myself.”\nHe crossed the same ridge of rock in the path, and she watched\nanxiously, as he was carrying her satchel. She trusted him better with it over\nthe water than she trusted herself, though. She reached for it when he\narrived on the other side, but found herself taking his arm to draw his\nattention.\n“How about this?” she said, holding his eyes. “I promise, solemnly and\nby the tenth name of the Almighty, that I mean no harm to Adolin or his\nfamily. I mean to prevent a disaster. I might be wrong, and I might be\nmisguided, but I vow to you that I’m sincere.”\nHe stared into her eyes. So intense. She felt a shiver meeting that\nexpression. This was a man of passion.\n“I believe you,” he said. “And I guess that will do.” He looked upward,\nthen cursed.\n“What?” she asked, looking toward the distant light above. The sun was\npeeking out over the lip of the ridge there.\nThe wrong ridge. They weren’t going west any longer. They’d strayed\nagain, pointing southward.\n“Blast,” Shallan said. “Give me that satchel. I need to draw this out.”\n71. Vigil\nHe bears the weight of God’s own divine\nhatred, separated from the virtues that gave it\ncontext. He is what we made him to be, old friend.\nAnd that is what he, unfortunately, wished to\nbecome.\n“I was young,” Teft said, “so I didn’t hear much. Kelek, I didn’t want to\nhear much. The things my family did, they weren’t the sort of things you\nwant your parents doing, all right? I didn’t want to know. So it’s not\nsurprising I can’t remember.”\nSigzil nodded in that mild, yet infuriating way of his. The Azish man\njust knew things. And he made you tell him things too. Unfair, that was.\nTerribly. Why did Teft have to end up with him on watch duty?\nThe two sat on rocks near the chasms just east of Dalinar’s warcamp. A\ncold wind blew in. Highstorm tonight.\nHe’ll be back before then. Surely by then.\nA cremling scuttled past. Teft threw a rock at it, driving it toward a\nnearby crack. “I don’t know why you want to hear all of these things\nanyway. They aren’t any use.”\nSigzil nodded. Storming foreigner."

Storming foreigner.\n“All right, fine,” Teft said. “It was some kind of cult, you see, called the\nEnvisagers. They… well, they thought if they could find a way to return the\nVoidbringers, then the Knights Radiant would return as well. Stupid, right?\nOnly, they knew things. Things they shouldn’t, things like what Kaladin can\ndo.”\n“I see this is hard for you,” Sigzil said. “Want to play another hand of\nmichim to pass the time instead?”\n“You just want my storming spheres,” Teft snapped, wagging his finger\nat the Azish man. “And don’t call it by that name.”\n“Michim is the game’s actual name.”\n“That’s a holy word, and ain’t no game named a holy word.”\n“The word isn’t holy where it came from,” Sigzil said, obviously\nannoyed.\n“We ain’t there now, are we? Call it something else.”\n“I thought you’d like it,” Sigzil said, picking up the colored rocks that\nwere used in the game. You bet them, in a pile, while trying to guess the\nones your opponent had hidden. “It’s a game of skill, not chance, so it\ndoesn’t offend Vorin sensibilities.”\nTeft watched him pick up the rocks. Maybe it would be better if he just\nlost all of his spheres in that storming game. It wasn’t good for him to have\nmoney again. He couldn’t be trusted with money.\n“They thought,” Teft said, “that people were more likely to manifest\npowers if their lives were in danger. So… they’d put lives in danger.\nMembers of their own group—never an innocent outsider, bless the winds.\nBut that was bad enough. I watched people let themselves be pushed off\ncliffs, watched them tied in place with a candle slowly burning a rope until\nit snapped and dropped a rock to crush them. It was bad, Sigzil. Awful. The\nsort of thing nobody should have to watch, especially a boy of six.”\n“So what did you do?” Sigzil asked softly, pulling tight the string on his\nlittle bag of rocks.\n“Ain’t none of your business,” Teft said. “Don’t know why I’m even\ntalking to you.”\n“It’s all right,” Sigzil said. “I can see—”\n“I turned them in,” Teft blurted out. “To the citylord. He held a trial for\nthem, a big one. Had them all executed in the end. Never did understand\nthat. They were only a danger to themselves. Their punishment for\nthreatening suicide was to be killed. Nonsense, that is. Should have found a\nway to help them…”\n“Your parents?”\n“Mother died in that rock–string contraption,” Teft said. “She really\nbelieved, Sig. That she had it in her, you know? The powers? That if she\nwere about to die, they’d come out in her, and she’d save herself…”\n“And you watched?”\n“Storms, no! You think they’d let her son watch that? Are you mad?”\n“But—”"

Are you mad?”\n“But—”\n“Did watch my father die, though,” Teft said, looking out over the\nPlains. “Hanged.” He shook his head, digging in his pocket. Where had he\nput that flask? As he turned, however, he caught sight of that other lad\nsitting back there, fiddling with his little box as he often did. Renarin.\nTeft wasn’t one for all that nonsense like Moash had talked about,\nwanting to overturn lighteyes. The Almighty had put them in their place,\nand who had business questioning him? Not spearmen, that’s for certain.\nBut in a way, Prince Renarin was as bad as Moash. Neither one knew their\nplace. A lighteyes wanting to join Bridge Four was as bad as a darkeyes\ntalking stupid and lofty to the king. It didn’t fit, even if the other bridgemen\nseemed to like the lad.\nAnd, of course, Moash was one of them now. Storms. Had he left his\nflask back at the barrack?\n“Heads up, Teft,” Sigzil said, rising.\nTeft turned around and saw men in uniform approaching. He scrambled\nto his feet, grabbing his spear. It was Dalinar Kholin, accompanied by\nseveral of his lighteyed advisors, along with Drehy and Skar from Bridge\nFour, the day’s guards. With Moash promoted away and Kaladin… well,\nnot there… Teft had taken over daily assignments. Nobody else would\nstorming do it. They said he was in command now. Idiots.\n“Brightlord,” Teft said, slapping his chest in salute.\n“Adolin told me you men were coming here,” the highprince said. He\nspared a glance for Prince Renarin, who had also stood and saluted, as if\nthis weren’t his own father. “A rotation, I understand?”\n“Yes, sir,” Teft said, looking toward Sigzil. It was a rotation.\nTeft was just on nearly every shift.\n“You really think he’s alive out there, soldier?” Dalinar asked.\n“He is, sir,” Teft said. “It’s not about what I or anyone thinks.”\n“He fell hundreds of feet,” Dalinar said.\nTeft continued to stand at attention. The highprince hadn’t asked a\nquestion, so Teft didn’t give a reply.\nHe did have to banish a few terrible images in his head. Kaladin having\nknocked his head while falling. Kaladin having been crushed by the falling\nbridge. Kaladin lying with a broken leg, unable to find spheres to heal\nhimself. The fool boy thought he was immortal, sometimes.\nKelek. They all thought he was.\n“He is going to come back, sir,” Sigzil said to Dalinar. “He’s going to\ncome climbing right up out of that chasm right there. It will be well if we’re\nhere to meet him. Uniforms on, spears polished.”\n“We wait on our own time, sir,” Teft said. “Neither of us three are\nsupposed to be anywhere else.” He blushed as soon as he said it. And here"

And here\nhe’d been thinking about how Moash talked back to his betters.\n“I didn’t come to order you away from your chosen task, soldier,”\nDalinar said. “I came to make certain you were caring for yourselves. No\nmen are to skip meals to wait here, and I don’t want you getting any ideas\nabout waiting during a highstorm.”\n“Er, yes, sir,” Teft said. He had used his morning meal break to put in\nduty here. How had Dalinar known?\n“Good luck, soldier,” Dalinar said, then continued on his way, flanked\nby attendants, apparently off to inspect the battalion that was nearest to the\neastern edge of camp. Soldiers there scurried like cremlings after a storm,\ncarrying supply bags and piling them inside their barracks. The time for\nDalinar’s full expedition onto the Plains was quickly approaching.\n“Sir,” Teft called after the highprince.\nDalinar turned back toward him, his attendants pausing mid-sentence.\n“You don’t believe us,” Teft said. “That he’ll come back, I mean.”\n“He’s dead, soldier. But I understand that you need to be here anyway.”\nThe highprince touched his hand to his shoulder, a salute to the dead, then\ncontinued on his way.\nWell, Teft supposed that was all right, Dalinar not believing. He’d just\nbe that much more surprised when Kaladin did return.\nHighstorm tonight, Teft thought, settling back down on his rock. Come\non, lad. What are you doing out there?\n* * *\nKaladin felt like one of the ten fools.\nActually, he felt like all of them. Ten times an idiot. But most\nspecifically Eshu, who spoke of things he did not understand in front of\nthose who did.\nNavigation this deep in the chasms was hard, but he could usually read\ndirections by the way that the debris was deposited. Water blew in from the\neast to the west, but then it drained out the other way—so cracks on walls\nwhere debris was smashed in tight usually marked a western direction, but\nplaces where debris had been deposited more naturally—as water drained—\nmarked where water had flowed east.\nHis instincts told him which way to go. They’d been wrong. He\nshouldn’t have been so confident. This far from the warcamps, the\nwaterflows must be different.\nAnnoyed at himself, he left Shallan drawing and walked out a ways.\n“Syl?” he asked.\nNo response.\n“Sylphrena!” he said, louder.\nHe sighed and walked back to Shallan, who knelt on the mossy ground\n—she’d obviously given up on protecting the once-fine dress from stains\nand rips—drawing on her sketchpad. She was another reason he felt like a\nfool. He shouldn’t let her provoke him so. He could hold in the retorts\nagainst other, far more annoying lighteyes. Why did he lose control when\ntalking with her?\nShould have learned my lesson, he thought as she sketched, her\nexpression growing intense. She’s won every argument so far, hands down."

        "text": "talking with her?\nShould have learned my lesson, he thought as she sketched, her\nexpression growing intense. She’s won every argument so far, hands down.\nHe leaned against a section of the chasm wall, spear in the crook of his\narm, light shining from the spheres tied tightly at its head. He had made\ninvalid assumptions about her, as she had so poignantly noted. Again and\nagain. It was like a part of him frantically wanted to dislike her.\nIf only he could find Syl. Everything would be better if he could see her\nagain, if he could know that she was all right. That scream…\nTo distract himself, he moved over to Shallan, then leaned down to see\nher sketch. Her map was more of a picture, one that looked eerily like the\nview Kaladin had had, nights ago, when flying above the Shattered Plains.\n“Is all that necessary?” he asked as she shaded in the sides of a plateau.\n“Yes.”\n“But—”\n“Yes.”\nIt took longer than he’d have preferred. The sun passed through the\ncrack overhead, vanishing from sight. Already past noon. They had seven\nhours until the highstorm, assuming the timing prediction was right—even\nthe best stormwardens got the calculations wrong sometimes.\nSeven hours. The hike out here, he thought, took about that long. But\nsurely they’d made some progress toward the warcamps. They’d been\nwalking all morning.\nWell, no use rushing Shallan. He left her to it, walking back along the\nchasm, looking up at the shape of the rift up above and comparing it to her\ndrawing. From what he could see, her map was dead on. She was drawing,\nfrom memory, their entire path as if seen from above—and she did it\nperfectly, every little knob and ledge accounted for.\n“Stormfather,” he whispered, jogging back. He’d known she had skill in\ndrawing, but this was something entirely different.\nWho was this woman?\nShe was still drawing when he arrived. “Your picture is amazingly\naccurate,” he said.\n“I may have… underplayed my skill a little last night,” Shallan said. “I\ncan remember things pretty well, though to be honest, I didn’t realize how\nfar off our path was until I drew it. A lot of these plateau shapes are\nunfamiliar to me; we might be into the areas that haven’t been mapped yet.”\nHe looked to her. “You remember the shapes of all of the plateaus on\nthe maps?”\n“Uh… yes?”\n“That’s incredible.”\nShe sat back on her knees, holding up her sketch. She brushed aside an\nunruly lock of red hair. “Maybe not. Something’s very odd here.”\n“What?”\n“I think my sketch must be off.” She stood up, looking troubled. “I need\nmore information. I’m going to walk around one of the plateaus here.”\n“All right…”\nShe started walking, still focused on her sketch, barely paying attention\nto where she was going as she stumbled over rocks and sticks. He kept up\nwith ease, but didn’t bother her as she turned her eyes toward the rift ahead.\nShe walked them all the way around the base of the plateau to their right.\nIt took a painfully long time, even walking quickly. They were losing\nminutes. Did she know where they were or not?"

She began\nwalking around the base of that plateau.\n“Shallan,” Kaladin said. “We don’t have—”\n“This is important.”\n“So is not getting crushed in a highstorm.”\n“If we don’t find out where we are, we won’t ever escape,” she said,\nhanding him the sheet of paper. “Wait here. I’ll be right back.” She jogged\noff, skirt swishing.\nKaladin stared at the paper, inspecting the path she’d drawn. Though\nthey’d started the morning going the right way, it was as he’d feared—\nKaladin had eventually wound them around until they were going directly\nsouth again. He’d even somehow turned them back going east for a while!\nThat put them even farther from Dalinar’s camp than when they’d\nbegun the night before.\nPlease let her be wrong, he thought, going around the plateau the other\ndirection to meet her halfway.\nBut if she was wrong, they wouldn’t know where they were at all.\nWhich option was worse?\nHe got a short distance down the chasm before freezing. The walls here\nwere scraped free of moss, the debris on the floor pushed around and\nscratched. Storms, this was fresh. Since the last highstorm at least. The\nchasmfiend had come this way.\nMaybe… maybe it had gone past on its way farther out into the chasms.\nShallan, distracted and muttering to herself, appeared around the other\nside of the plateau. She walked, still staring at the sky, muttering to herself.\n“… I know I said that I saw these patterns, but this is too grand a scale for\nme to know instinctively. You should have said something. I—”\nShe cut off abruptly, jumping as she saw Kaladin. He found himself\nnarrowing his eyes. That had sounded like…\nDon’t be silly. She’s no warrior. The Knights Radiant had been soldiers,\nhadn’t they? He didn’t really know much about them.\nStill, Syl had seen several strange spren about.\nShallan gave a glance to the wall of the chasm and the scrapes. “Is that\nwhat I think it is?”\n“Yeah,” he said.\n“Delightful. Here, give me that paper.”\nHe handed it back and she slipped a pencil out of her sleeve. He gave\nher the satchel, which she set on the floor, using the stiff side as a place to\nsketch. She filled in the two plateaus closest to them, the ones she’d walked\naround to get a full view.\n“So is your drawing off or not?” Kaladin asked.\n“It’s accurate,” Shallan said as she drew, “it’s just strange. From my\nmemory of the maps, this set of plateaus nearest to us should be farther to\nthe north. There is another group of them up there that are exactly the same\nshape, only mirrored.”\n“You can remember the maps that well?”\n“Yes.”\nHe didn’t press further. From what he’d seen, maybe she could do just\nthat."

From what he’d seen, maybe she could do just\nthat.\nShe shook her head. “What are the chances that a series of plateaus\nwould take the exact same shape as those on another part of the Plains? Not\njust one, but an entire sequence…”\n“The Plains are symmetrical,” Kaladin said.\nShe froze. “How do you know that?”\n“I… it was a dream. I saw the plateaus arrayed in a wide symmetrical\nformation.”\nShe looked back at her map, then gasped. She began scribbling notes on\nthe side. “Cymatics.”\n“What?”\n“I know where the Parshendi are.” Her eyes widened. “And the\nOathgate. The center of the Shattered Plains. I can see it all—I can map\nalmost the entire thing.”\nHe shivered. “You… what?”\nShe looked up sharply, meeting his eyes. “We have to get back.”\n“Yes, I know. The highstorm.”\n“More than that,” she said, standing. “I know too much now to die out\nhere. The Shattered Plains are a pattern. This isn’t a natural rock\nformation.” Her eyes widened further. “At the center of these Plains was a\ncity. Something broke it apart. A weapon… Vibrations? Like sand on a\nplate? An earthquake that could break rock… Stone became sand, and at the\nblowing of the highstorms, the cracks full of sand were hollowed out.”\nHer eyes seemed eerily distant, and Kaladin didn’t understand half of\nwhat she’d said.\n“We need to reach the center,” Shallan said. “I can find it, the heart of\nthese Plains, by following the pattern. And there will be… things there…”\n“The secret you’re searching for,” Kaladin said. What had she said just\nearlier? “Oathgate?”\nShe blushed deeply. “Let’s keep moving. Didn’t you mention how little\ntime we had? Honestly, if one of us weren’t chatting away all the time and\ndistracting everyone, I’m half certain we’d be back already.”\nHe cocked an eyebrow at her, and she grinned, then pointed the\ndirection for them to go. “I’m leading now, by the way.”\n“Probably for the best.”\n“Though,” she said, “as I consider, it might be better to let you lead.\nThat way, we might find our way to the center by accident. Assuming we\ndon’t end up in Azir.”\nHe gave her a chuckle at that because it seemed the right thing to do.\nInside, however, it ripped him apart. He’d failed.\nThe next few hours were excruciating. After walking the length of two\nplateaus, Shallan had to stop and update her map. It was correct to do so—\nthey couldn’t risk getting off track again.\nIt just took so much time. Even moving as quickly as they could\nbetween drawing sessions, practically running the entire way, their progress\nwas too slow.\nKaladin shuffled from foot to foot, watching the sky as Shallan filled in\nher map again. She cursed and grumbled, and he noticed her brushing away\na drop of sweat that had fallen from her brow onto the increasingly\ncrumpled paper."

We aren’t going\nto make it.\n“I’ll try for scouts again,” he said.\nShallan nodded. They had entered the territory where Dalinar’s pole-\nwielding scouts watched for new chrysalises. Shouting to them was a slim\nhope—even if they were lucky enough to find one of those groups, he\ndoubted they had enough rope handy to reach to the bottom of the chasm.\nBut it was a chance. So he moved away—so as to not disturb her\ndrawing—cupped his mouth, and began shouting. “Hello! Please reply!\nWe’re trapped in the chasms! Please reply!”\nHe walked for a time, shouting, then stopped to listen. Nothing came\nback. No questioning shouts echoing down from above, no signs of life.\nThey’ve probably all withdrawn into their cubbies by now, Kaladin\nthought. They’ve broken down their watchposts and are waiting for the\nhighstorm.\nHe stared up with frustration at that slot of attenuated sky. So distant.\nHe remembered this feeling, being down here with Teft and the others,\nlonging to climb out and escape the horrible life of a bridgeman.\nFor the hundredth time, he tried drawing in the Stormlight of those\nspheres. He clutched the sphere until his hand and the glass were sweaty,\nbut the Stormlight—the power within—did not flow to him. He couldn’t\nfeel the Light anymore.\n“Syl!” he yelled, tucking away the sphere, cupping his hands around his\nmouth. “Syl! Please! Are you there, anywhere… ?” He trailed off. “I still\ndon’t know,” he said more softly. “Is this a punishment? Or is it something\nmore? What is wrong?”\nNo reply. Surely if she were watching him, she wouldn’t let him die\ndown here. Assuming she could think to notice. He had a horrible image of\nher riding the winds, mingling with the windspren, having forgotten herself\nand him—becoming terribly, blissfully ignorant of what she truly was.\nShe’d feared that. She’d been terrified of it.\nShallan’s boots scratched the ground as she walked up. “No luck?”\nHe shook his head.\n“Well, onward, then.” She took a deep breath. “Through soreness and\nexhaustion we go. You wouldn’t be willing to carry me a little ways…”\nHe glared at her.\nShe shrugged with a smile. “Think how grand it would be! I could even\nget a reed to whip you with. You’d be able to go back and tell all the other\nguards what an awful person I am. It’ll be a wonderful opportunity for\ngriping. No? Well, all right then. Off we go.”\n“You’re a strange woman.”\n“Thank you.”\nHe fell into step beside her.\n“My,” she noted, “you’ve brewed another storm over your head, I see.”\n“I’ve killed us,” he whispered. “I took the lead, and I got us lost.”\n“Well, I didn’t notice we were going the wrong way either.

I wouldn’t\nhave done any better.”\n“I should have thought to have you map our progress from the start\ntoday. I was too confident.”\n“It’s done,” she said. “If I’d been more clear with you about how well I\ncould draw these plateaus, then you’d probably have made better use of my\nmaps. I didn’t, and you didn’t know, so here we are. You can’t blame\nyourself for everything, right?”\nHe walked in silence.\n“Uh, right?”\n“It’s my fault.”\nShe rolled her eyes exaggeratedly. “You are really intent on beating\nyourself up, aren’t you?”\nHis father had said the same thing time and time again. It was who\nKaladin was. Did they expect him to change?\n“We’ll be fine,” Shallan said. “You’ll see.”\nThat darkened his mood further.\n“You still think I’m too optimistic, don’t you?” Shallan said.\n“It’s not your fault,” Kaladin said. “I’d rather be like you. I’d rather not\nhave lived the life I have. I would that the world was only full of people like\nyou, Shallan Davar.”\n“People who don’t understand pain.”\n“Oh, all people understand pain,” Kaladin said. “That’s not what I’m\ntalking about. It’s…”\n“The sorrow,” Shallan said softly, “of watching a life crumble? Of\nstruggling to grab it and hold on, but feeling hope become stringy sinew\nand blood beneath your fingers as everything collapses?”\n“Yes.”\n“The sensation—it’s not sorrow, but something deeper—of being\nbroken. Of being crushed so often, and so hatefully, that emotion becomes\nsomething you can only wish for. If only you could cry, because then you’d\nfeel something. Instead, you feel nothing. Just… haze and smoke inside.\nLike you’re already dead.”\nHe stopped in the chasm.\nShe turned and looked to him. “The crushing guilt,” she said, “of being\npowerless. Of wishing they’d hurt you instead of those around you. Of\nscreaming and scrambling and hating as those you love are ruined, popped\nlike a boil. And you have to watch their joy seeping away while you can’t\ndo anything. They break the ones you love, and not you. And you plead.\nCan’t you just beat me instead?”\n“Yes,” he whispered.\nShallan nodded, holding his eyes. “Yes. It would be nice if nobody in\nthe world knew of those things, Kaladin Stormblessed. I agree. With\neverything I have.”\nHe saw it in her eyes. The anguish, the frustration. The terrible nothing\nthat clawed inside and sought to smother her. She knew. It was there, inside.\nShe had been broken.\nThen she smiled. Oh, storms. She smiled anyway.\nIt was the single most beautiful thing he’d seen in his entire life.\n“How?” he asked.\nShe shrugged lightly. “Helps if you’re crazy. Come on. I do believe\nwe’re under a slight time constraint…”\nShe started down the chasm. He stood behind, feeling drained. And\noddly brightened."

And\noddly brightened.\nHe should feel like a fool. He’d done it again—he’d been telling her\nhow easy her life was, while she’d had that hiding inside of her all along.\nThis time, though, he didn’t feel like an idiot. He felt like he understood.\nSomething. He didn’t know what. The chasm just seemed a little brighter.\nTien always did that to me… he thought. Even on the darkest day.\nHe stood still long enough that frillblooms opened around him, their\nwide, fanlike fronds displaying veined patterns of orange, red, and violet.\nHe eventually jogged after Shallan, shocking the plants closed.\n“I think,” she said, “we need to focus on the positive side of being down\nhere in this terrible chasm.”\nShe eyed him. He didn’t say anything.\n“Come on,” she said.\n“I… have the sense that it would be better not to encourage you.”\n“What’s the fun in that?”\n“Well, we are about to get hit by a highstorm’s flood.”\n“So our clothing will get washed,” she said with a grin. “See! Positive.”\nHe snorted.\n“Ah, that bridgeman grunt dialect again,” she noted.\n“That grunt meant,” he said, “that at least if the waters come, it will\nwash away some of your stench.”\n“Ha! Mildly amusing, but no points to you. I already established that\nyou’re the malodorous one. Reuse of jokes is strictly forbidden on pain of\ngetting dunked in a highstorm.”\n“All right then,” he said. “It’s a good thing we’re down here because I\nhad guard duty tonight. Now I’m going to miss it. That is practically like\ngetting the day off.”\n“To go swimming, no less!”\nHe smiled.\n“I,” she proclaimed, “am glad we are down here because the sun is far\ntoo bright up above, and it tends to give me a sunburn unless I wear a hat. It\nis much better to be down in the dank, dark, smelly, moldy, potentially life-\nthreatening depths. No sunburns. Just monsters.”\n“I’m glad to be down here,” he said, “because at least it was me, and not\none of my men, who fell.”\nShe hopped over a puddle, then eyed him. “You’re not very good at\nthis.”\n“Sorry. I meant that I’m glad to be down here because when we get out,\neveryone will cheer me for being a hero for rescuing you.”\n“Better,” Shallan said. “Except for the fact that I do believe that I am the\none rescuing you.”\nHe glanced at her map. “Point.”\n“I,” she said, “am glad to be down here because I’ve always wondered\nwhat it’s like to be a chunk of meat traveling through a digestive system,\nand these chasms remind me of the intestines.”\n“I hope you’re not serious.”\n“What?” She looked shocked. “Of course I’m not. Ew.”\n“You really do try too hard.”\n“It’s what keeps me insane.”"

Ew.”\n“You really do try too hard.”\n“It’s what keeps me insane.”\nHe scrambled up a large pile of debris, then offered a hand to help her.\n“I,” he said, “am happy to be here because it reminds me of how lucky I am\nto be free of Sadeas’s army.”\n“Ah,” she said, stepping up to the top with him.\n“His lighteyes sent us down here to gather,” Kaladin said, sliding down\nthe other side. “And didn’t pay us much at all for the effort.”\n“Tragic.”\n“You could say,” he told her as she stepped down off the pile, “that we\nwere given only a pittance.”\nHe grinned at her.\nShe cocked her head.\n“Pit-tance,” he said, gesturing toward the depth of the hole they were in.\n“You know. We’re in a pit…”\n“Oh, storms,” she said. “You don’t actually expect that to count. That\nwas terrible!”\n“I know. I’m sorry. My mother would be disappointed.”\n“She didn’t like wordplay?”\n“No, she loved it. She’d just be mad I tried to do it when she wasn’t\naround to laugh at me.”\nShallan smiled, and they continued on, keeping a brisk pace. “I am glad\nwe’re down here,” she said, “because by now, Adolin will be worried sick\nabout me—so when we get back, he’ll be ecstatic. He might even let me\nkiss him in public.”\nAdolin. Right. That dampened his mood.\n“We probably need to stop so I can draw out our map,” Shallan said,\nfrowning at the sky. “And so that you can yell some more for our potential\nsalvation.”\n“I suppose,” he said as she settled down to get out her map. He cupped\nhis hands. “Hey, up there? Anyone? We’re down here, and we’re making\nbad puns. Please save us from ourselves!”\nShallan chuckled.\nKaladin smiled, then started as he actually heard something echoing\nback. Was that a voice? Or… Wait…\nA trumping sound—like a horn’s call, but overlapping itself. It grew\nlouder, washing over them.\nThen an enormous, skittering mass of carapace and claws crashed\naround the corner.\nChasmfiend.\nKaladin’s mind panicked, but his body simply moved. He snatched\nShallan by the arm, hauling her to her feet and pulling her into a run. She\nshouted, dropping her satchel.\nKaladin pulled her after him and did not look back. He could feel the\nthing, too close, the walls of the chasm shaking from its pursuit. Bones,\ntwigs, shell, and plants cracked and snapped.\nThe monster trumped again, a deafening sound.\nIt was almost upon them. Storms, but it could move. He’d never have\nimagined something so large being so quick. There was no distracting it this\ntime. It was almost upon them; he could feel it right behind…\nThere.\nHe whipped Shallan in front of him and thrust her into a fissure in the\nwall.

She grunted as he pressed her against some of\nthe refuse of twigs and leaves that had been packed into this crack by\nfloodwaters.\nThe chasm fell silent. Kaladin could hear only Shallan’s panting and his\nown heartbeat. They’d left most of their spheres on the ground, where\nShallan had been preparing to draw. He still had his spear, his improvised\nlantern.\nSlowly, Kaladin twisted about, putting his back to Shallan. She held him\nfrom behind, and he could feel her tremble. Stormfather. He trembled\nhimself. He twisted his spear to give light, peering out at the chasm. This\nfissure was shallow, and only a few feet stood between him and the\nopening.\nThe frail, washed-out light of his diamond spheres twinkled off the wet\nfloor. It illuminated broken frillblooms on the walls and several writhing\nvines on the ground, severed from their plants. They twisted and flopped,\nlike men arching their backs. The chasmfiend… Where was it?\nShallan gasped, arms tightening around his waist. He looked up. There,\nhigher up the crack, a large, inhuman eye watched them. He couldn’t see\nthe bulk of the chasmfiend’s head; just part of the face and jaw, with that\nterrible glassy green eye. A large claw slammed against the side of the hole,\ntrying to force its way in, but the crack was too small.\nThe claw dug at the hole, and then the head withdrew. Scraping rock\nand chitin sounded in the chasm, but the thing didn’t go far before stopping.\nSilence. A steady drip somewhere fell into a pool. But otherwise,\nsilence.\n“It’s waiting,” Shallan whispered, head near his shoulder.\n“You sound proud of it!” Kaladin snapped.\n“A little.” She paused. “How long, do you suppose, until…”\nHe looked upward, but couldn’t see the sky. The crack didn’t run all the\nway up the side of the chasm, and was barely ten or fifteen feet tall. He\nleaned forward to look at the slot high above, not extending all the way out\nof the crack, just getting a little closer to the lip so he could see the sky. It\nwas getting dark. Not sunset yet, but getting close.\n“Two hours, maybe,” he said. “I—”\nA crashing tempest of carapace charged down the chasm. Kaladin\njumped back, pressing Shallan against the refuse again as the chasmfiend\ntried—without success—to get one of its legs into the fissure. The leg was\nstill too large, and though the chasmfiend could shove the tip in toward\nthem—getting close enough to brush Kaladin—it wasn’t enough to hurt\nthem.\nThat eye returned, reflecting the image of Kaladin and Shallan—tattered\nand dirtied from their time in the chasm. Kaladin looked less frightened\nthan he felt, staring that thing in the eye, spear held up wardingly. Shallan,\nrather than looking terrified, seemed fascinated.\nCrazy woman."

It stopped just down the chasm. He\ncould hear it settling down to watch.\n“So…” Shallan said, “we wait?”\nSweat trickled down the sides of Kaladin’s face. Wait. How long? He\ncould imagine staying in here, like a frightened rockbud trapped in its shell,\nuntil the waters came crashing through the chasms.\nHe’d survived a storm once. Barely, and only then with the aid of\nStormlight. In here, it would be far different. The waters would whip them\nin a surge through the chasms, smashing them into walls, boulders,\nchurning them with the dead until they drowned or were ripped limb from\nlimb…\nIt would be a very, very bad way to die.\nHis grip tightened on his spear. He waited, sweating, worrying. The\nchasmfiend didn’t leave. Minutes passed.\nFinally, Kaladin made his decision. He moved to step forward.\n“What are you doing!” Shallan hissed, sounding terrified. She tried to\nhold him back.\n“When I’m out,” he said, “run the other way.”\n“Don’t be stupid!”\n“I’ll distract it,” he said. “Once you’re free, I’ll lead it away from you,\nthen escape. We can meet back up.”\n“Liar,” she whispered.\nHe twisted about, meeting her eyes. “You can get back to the warcamps\non your own,” he said. “I can’t. You have information that needs to get to\nDalinar. I don’t. I have combat training. I might be able to get away from\nthe thing after distracting it. You couldn’t. If we wait here, we both die. Do\nyou need more logic than that?”\n“I hate logic,” she whispered. “Always have.”\n“We don’t have time to talk about it,” Kaladin said, twisting around, his\nback to her.\n“You can’t do this.”\n“I can.” He took a deep breath. “Who knows,” he said more softly,\n“maybe I’ll get in a lucky hit.” He reached up and ripped the spheres off his\nspearhead, then tossed them out into the chasm. He’d need a steadier light.\n“Get ready.”\n“Please,” she whispered, sounding more frantic. “Don’t leave me down\nin these chasms alone.”\nHe smiled wryly. “Is it really this hard for you to let me win one single\nargument?”\n“Yes!” she said. “No, I mean… Storms! Kaladin, it will kill you.”\nHe gripped his spear. The way things had been going with him lately,\nperhaps that was what he deserved. “Apologize to Adolin for me. I actually\nkind of like him. He’s a good man. Not just for a lighteyes. Just… a good\nperson. I’ve never given him the credit he deserves.”\n“Kaladin…”\n“It has to happen, Shallan.”\n“At least,” she said, reaching her hand over his shoulder and past his\nhead, “take this.”\n“Take what?”\n“This,” Shallan said.\nThen she summoned a Shardblade.\n72.

Selfish Reasons\nI suspect that he is more a force than an\nindividual now, despite your insistence to the\ncontrary. That force is contained, and an\nequilibrium reached.\nKaladin stared at the glistening length of metal, which dripped with\ncondensation from its summoning. It glowed softly the color of garnet\nalong several faint lines down its length.\nShallan had a Shardblade.\nHe twisted his head toward her, and in so doing, his cheek brushed the\nflat of the blade. No screams. He froze, then cautiously raised a finger and\ntouched the cold metal.\nNothing happened. The screech he had heard in his mind when fighting\nalongside Adolin did not recur. It seemed a very bad sign to him. Though he\ndid not know the meaning of that terrible sound, it was related to his bond\nwith Syl.\n“How?” he asked.\n“It’s not important.”\n“I rather think it is.”\n“Not at the moment! Look, are you going to take this thing? Holding it\nthis way is awkward. If I drop it by accident and cut off your foot, it’s going\nto be your fault.”\nHe hesitated, regarding his face reflected in its metal. He saw corpses,\nfriends with burning eyes. He’d refused these weapons each time one was\noffered to him.\nBut always before, it had been after the fight, or at least on the practice\ngrounds. This was different. Besides, he wasn’t choosing to become a\nShardbearer; he would only use this weapon to protect someone’s life.\nMaking a decision, he reached up and seized the Shardblade by the hilt.\nAt least this told him one thing—Shallan wasn’t likely to be a Surgebinder.\nOtherwise, he suspected she’d hate this Blade as much as he did.\n“You’re not supposed to let people use your Blade,” Kaladin said. “By\ntradition, only the king and the highprinces do that.”\n“Great,” she said. “You can report me to Brightness Navani for being\nwildly indecent and ignorant of protocol. For now, can we just survive,\nplease?”\n“Yeah,” he said, hefting the Blade. “That sounds wonderful.” He barely\nknew how to use one of these. Training with a practice sword did not make\nyou an expert with the real thing. Unfortunately, a spear was going to be of\nlittle use against a creature so large and so well armored.\n“Also…” Shallan said. “Could you not do that ‘reporting me’ thing I\nmentioned? That was a joke. I don’t think I’m supposed to have that\nBlade.”\n“Nobody would believe me anyway,” Kaladin said. “You are going to\nrun, right? As I instructed?”\n“Yes. But if you could, please lead the monster to the left.”\n“That’s toward the warcamps,” Kaladin said, frowning. “I was planning\nto lead it deeper into the chasms, so that you—”\n“I need to get back to my satchel,” Shallan said.\nCrazy woman. “We’re fighting for our lives, Shallan. The satchel is\nunimportant.”"

I’ll need that to help Dalinar.\nPlease, just do it.”\n“Fine. If I can.”\n“Good. And, um, please don’t die, all right?”\nHe was suddenly aware of her pressed against his back. Holding him,\nbreath warm on his neck. She trembled, and he thought he could hear in her\nvoice both terror and fascination at their situation.\n“I’ll do my best,” he said. “Get ready.”\nShe nodded, letting go of him.\nOne.\nTwo.\nThree.\nHe leaped out into the chasm, then turned and dashed left, toward the\nchasmfiend. Storming woman. The beast lurked in the shadows in that\ndirection. No, it was a shadow. An enormous, looming shadow, long and\neel-like, lifted above the floor of the chasm and gripping the walls with its\nlegs.\nIt trumped and surged forward, carapace scraping on rock. Holding\ntightly to the Shardblade, Kaladin threw himself to the ground and ducked\nunderneath the monster. The ground heaved as the beast smashed claws\ntoward him, but Kaladin came up unscathed. He swung wildly with the\nShardblade, carving a line in the rock wall beside him but missing the\nchasmfiend.\nIt curled in the chasm, twisting underneath itself, then turning about.\nThe maneuver went far more smoothly for the monster than Kaladin would\nhave hoped.\nHow do I even kill something like this? Kaladin wondered, backing up\nas the chasmfiend settled on the floor of the chasm to inspect him. Hacking\nat that enormous body was unlikely to kill it quickly enough. Did it have a\nheart? Not the stone gemheart, but a real one? He’d have to try to get\nunderneath it again.\nKaladin continued to back down the chasm, trying to lead the creature\naway from Shallan. It moved more carefully than Kaladin would have\nexpected. He was relieved to catch sight of Shallan escaping the crack and\nscrambling away down the passage.\n“Come on, you,” Kaladin said, waving the Shardblade at the\nchasmfiend. It reared up in the chasm, but did not strike at him. It watched,\neyes hidden in its darkened face. The only light came from the distant slit\nhigh above and the spheres he’d tossed out into the chasm, which now were\nbehind the monster.\nShallan’s Blade glowed softly too, from a strange pattern along its\nlength. Kaladin had never seen one do that before, but then, he’d never seen\na Shardblade in the dark before.\nLooking up at the rearing, alien silhouette before him—with its too\nmany legs, its twisted head, its segmented armor—Kaladin thought he must\nknow what a Voidbringer looked like. Surely nothing more terrible than this\ncould exist.\nStepping backward, Kaladin stumbled on an outcropping of shalebark\nsprouting from the floor.\nThe chasmfiend struck."

Shadowy\nclaws smashed around him as he came out of his roll and sprang one way,\nthen the other. He ended up pressed against the slimy side of the chasm just\nin front of the monster, puffing. He was too close for the claws to get him,\nperhaps, and—\nThe head snapped down, mandibles gaping. Kaladin cursed, hurling\nhimself to the side again. He grunted, rolling to his feet and scooping up the\ndiscarded Shardblade. It hadn’t vanished—he knew enough about them to\nunderstand that once Shallan instructed it to remain, it would stay until she\nsummoned it back.\nKaladin turned around as a claw came down where he had just been. He\ngot a swipe at it, cutting through the claw’s tip as it crashed into rock.\nHis cut didn’t seem to do much. The Blade scored the carapace and\nkilled the flesh inside—prompting a trump of anger—but the claw was\nenormous. He’d done the equivalent of cutting off the tip of an enemy\nsoldier’s big toe. Storms. He wasn’t fighting the beast; he was just annoying\nit.\nIt came more aggressively, sweeping at him with a claw. Fortunately,\nthe confines of the chasm made it difficult for the creature to swing; its\narms brushed the walls, and it couldn’t pull back for full leverage. That was\nprobably why Kaladin was still alive. He got out of the way of the sweep,\nbarely, but tripped in the darkness again. He could hardly see.\nAs another claw crashed toward him, Kaladin got to his feet and dashed\naway—running farther down the corridor, farther from the light, passing\nplants and flotsam. The chasmfiend trumped and charged after him,\nclacking and scraping.\nKaladin felt so slow without Stormlight. So clumsy and awkward.\nThe chasmfiend was close. He judged his next move by instinct. Now!\nHe stopped with a lurch, then sprinted back toward the creature. It slowed\nwith great difficulty, carapace grinding on the walls, and Kaladin ducked\nand ran beneath it. He slammed the Shardblade upward, sinking it deep into\nthe creature’s underside.\nThe beast trumped more frantically. He seemed to have actually hurt it,\nfor it immediately lifted upward to pull itself off the sword. Then it twisted\ndown upon itself in an eyeblink, and Kaladin found those frightful jaws\ncoming at him. He threw himself forward, but the snapping jaws caught his\nleg.\nBlinding pain ran up the limb, and he struck out with the Blade even as\nthe beast flung him about. He thought he hit its face, though he couldn’t be\ncertain.\nThe world spun.\nHe hit the ground and rolled.\nNo time to be dizzy. With everything still spinning, he groaned and\nturned over.

It had flown far, embedding\nitself in the ground near the spheres he’d tossed from the rift. Kaladin\nhobbled toward it, but had trouble walking, let alone running. He was\nhalfway there when his leg gave out. He hit hard, scraping his arm on\nshalebark.\nThe chasmfiend trumped and—\n“Hey! Hey!”\nKaladin twisted about. Shallan? What was that fool woman doing,\nstanding in the chasm, waving her hands like a maniac? How had she even\ngotten past him?\nShe yelled again, getting the chasmfiend’s attention. Her voice echoed\noddly.\nThe chasmfiend turned from Kaladin to Shallan, then began to smash at\nher.\n“No!” Kaladin yelled. But what was the use in shouting? He needed his\nweapon. Gritting his teeth, he twisted about and scrambled—as best he\ncould—to the Shardblade. Storms. Shallan…\nHe ripped the sword from the rock, but then he collapsed again. The leg\njust wouldn’t hold him. He twisted back, holding out the Blade, searching\nthe chasm. The monster continued to swipe about, trumping, the terrible\nsound echoing and reverberating in the narrow confines. Kaladin couldn’t\nsee a corpse. Had Shallan escaped?\nStabbing the blasted thing through the chest only seemed to have made\nit angrier. The head. His only chance was the head.\nKaladin struggled to his feet. The monster stopped smashing against the\nground and with a trump surged toward him. Kaladin gripped the sword in\ntwo hands, then wavered. His leg buckled beneath him. He tried to go down\non one knee, but the leg gave out completely, and he slumped to the side\nand narrowly avoided slicing himself with the Shardblade.\nHe splashed into a pool of water. In front of him, one of the spheres\nhe’d tossed shone with a bright white light.\nHe reached into the water, snatching it, clutching the chilled glass. He\nneeded that Light. Storms, his life depended on it.\nPlease.\nThe chasmfiend loomed above.\nKaladin sucked in a breath, straining, like a man gasping for air. He\nheard… as if distantly…\nWeeping.\nNo power entered him.\nThe chasmfiend swung and Kaladin twisted, and strangely found\nhimself.

Shallan\ncried out, freehand to mouth, from where she hid behind a boulder, her skin\nand clothing turned deep black.\nThe chasmfiend had fallen on Kaladin.\nShallan dropped her paper—it bore a drawing of her and another of\nKaladin—and scrambled across the rocks, dismissing the blackness around\nher. She’d needed to be close to the fighting for the illusions to work. Better\nif she’d been able to send them on Pattern, but that was problematic\nbecause—\nShe stopped in front of the still-twitching beast, a heap of flesh and\ncarapace like a fallen avalanche of stone. She shifted from one foot to\nanother, uncertain what to do. “Kaladin?” she called out. Her voice was frail\nin the darkness.\nStop it, she told herself. No timidity. You’re past that. Taking a deep\nbreath, she moved forward, picking her way over the huge armored legs.\nShe tried to shove aside a claw, but it was far too heavy for her, so she\nclimbed over it and skidded down the other side.\nShe froze as she heard something. The chasmfiend’s head lay nearby,\nmassive eyes cloudy. Spren started to rise from it, like trails of smoke. The\nsame ones as before, only… leaving? She held her light closer.\nThe bottom half of Kaladin’s body protruded from the chasmfiend’s\nmouth. Almighty above! Shallan gasped, then scrambled forward. She tried,\nwith difficulty, to pull Kaladin from the closed maw before summoning her\nShardblade and cutting away at several mandibles.\n“Kaladin?” she asked, nervously peering into the thing’s mouth from the\nside, where she’d removed a mandible.\n“Ow,” a weak voice trailed back to her.\nAlive! “Hang on!” she said, hacking at the thing’s head, careful not to\ncut too close to Kaladin. Violet ichor spurted out, coating her arms,\nsmelling like wet mold.\n“This is kind of uncomfortable…” Kaladin said.\n“You’re alive,” Shallan said. “Stop complaining.”\nHe was alive. Oh, Stormfather. Alive. She would have a whole heap of\nprayers to burn when they got back.\n“Smells awful in here,” Kaladin said weakly. “Almost as bad as you"

She would have a whole heap of\nprayers to burn when they got back.\n“Smells awful in here,” Kaladin said weakly. “Almost as bad as you\ndo.”\n“Be glad,” Shallan said as she worked. “Here, I have a reasonably\nperfect specimen of a chasmfiend—with only a minor case of being dead—\nand I’m chopping it apart for you instead of studying it.”\n“I’m eternally grateful.”\n“How did you get in its mouth, anyway?” Shallan asked, prying off a\npiece of carapace with a sickening sound. She tossed it aside.\n“Stabbed it through the roof of its mouth,” Kaladin said, “into the brain.\nOnly way I could figure to kill the blasted thing.”\nShe leaned down, reaching her hand through the large hole she’d\nopened. With some work—and with a little cutting at the front mandibles—\nshe managed to help Kaladin wiggle out the side of the mouth. Covered in\nichor and blood, face pale from apparent blood loss, he looked like death\nitself.\n“Storms,” she whispered, as he lay back on the rocks.\n“Bind my leg,” Kaladin said weakly. “The rest of me should be fine.\nHeal right up…”\nShe looked at the mess of his leg, and shivered. It looked like… Like…\nBalat…\nKaladin wouldn’t be walking on that leg anytime soon. Oh, Stormfather,\nshe thought, cutting off the skirt of her dress at the knees. She wrapped his\nleg tightly, as he instructed. He seemed to think he didn’t need a tourniquet.\nShe listened to him; he’d probably bound far more wounds than she had.\nShe cut the sleeve off her right arm and used that to bind a second\nwound on his side, where the chasmfiend had started to rip him in half as it\nbit. Then she settled down next to him, feeling drained and cold, legs and\narm now exposed to the chill air of the chasm bottom.\nKaladin took a deep breath, resting on the rock ground, eyes closed.\n“Two hours until the highstorm,” he whispered.\nShallan checked the sky. It was almost dark. “If that long,” she\nwhispered. “We beat it, but we’re dead anyway, aren’t we?”\n“Seems unfair,” he said. Then he groaned, sitting up.\n“Shouldn’t you—”\n“Bah. I’ve had far worse wounds than this.”\nShe raised an eyebrow at him as he opened his eyes. He looked dizzy.\n“I have,” he insisted. “That’s not just soldier bravado.”\n“This bad?” she asked. “How often?”\n“Twice,” he admitted. He looked over the hulking form of the\nchasmfiend. “We actually killed the thing.”\n“Sad, I know,” she said, feeling depressed. “It was beautiful.”\n“It would be more beautiful if it hadn’t tried to eat me.”\n“From my perspective,” Shallan noted, “it didn’t try, it succeeded.”\n“Nonsense,” Kaladin said. “It didn’t manage to swallow me. Doesn’t\ncount.” He held his hand out to her, as if for help getting to his feet.\n“You want to try to keep going?”"

Doesn’t\ncount.” He held his hand out to her, as if for help getting to his feet.\n“You want to try to keep going?”\n“You expect me to just lie here in the chasm until the waters come?”\n“No, but…” She looked up. The chasmfiend was big. Maybe twenty\nfeet tall, as it lay on its side. “What if we climbed up that thing, then tried to\nscale up to the top of the plateau?” The farther westward they’d gone, the\nshallower the chasms had grown.\nKaladin looked up. “That’s still a good eighty feet of climbing, Shallan.\nAnd what would we do on the top of the plateau? The storm would blow us\noff.”\n“We could at least try to find some kind of shelter…” she said. “Storms,\nit really is hopeless, isn’t it?”\nOddly, he cocked his head. “Probably.”\n“Only ‘probably’?”\n“Shelter… You have a Shardblade.”\n“And?” she asked. “I can’t cut away a wall of water.”\n“No, but you can cut stone.” He looked up, toward the wall of the\nchasm.\nShallan’s breath caught in her throat. “We can carve out a cubby! Like\nthe scouts use.”\n“High up the wall,” he said. “You can see the water line up there. If we\ncan get above that…”\nIt still meant climbing. She wouldn’t have to go all the way to where the\nchasm got narrow at the top, but it wouldn’t be an easy climb, by any\nmeans. And she had very little time.\nBut it was a chance.\n“You’re going to have to do it,” Kaladin said. “I might be able to stand,\nwith help. But climbing while wielding a Shardblade…”\n“Right,” Shallan said, standing up. She took a deep breath. “Right.”\nShe started by scaling the back of the chasmfiend. The smooth carapace\nmade for slippery climbing, but she found footholds between plates. Once\non its back, she looked up toward the water line. It seemed much higher\nthan it had from below.\n“Cut handholds,” Kaladin called.\nRight. She kept forgetting about the Shardblade. She didn’t want to\nthink about it…\nNo. No time for that now. She summoned the Blade and cut out a series\nof long strips of rock, sending chunks falling to bounce off the carapace.\nShe tucked her hair behind her ear, working in the dim light to create a\nladderlike series of handholds up the side of the wall.\nShe started climbing them. Standing on one and clinging to the highest\none, she summoned the Blade again and tried to cut a step even higher, but\nthe thing was just so blasted long.\nObligingly, it shrank in her hand to the size of a much shorter sword,\nreally a big knife.\nThank you, she thought, then cut out the next line of rock.\nUp she went, handhold after handhold.

She hung there awkwardly, then began hacking out sections of\nrock, trying to cut them so they wouldn’t tumble backward onto her head.\nFalling stone made a beating sound on the dead chasmfiend’s armor.\n“You’re doing great!” Kaladin called up to her. “Keep at it!”\n“When did you get so peppy?” she shouted.\n“Ever since I assumed I was dead, then I suddenly wasn’t.”\n“Then remind me to try to kill you once in a while,” she snapped. “If I\nsucceed, it will make me feel better, and if I fail, it will make you feel\nbetter. Everyone wins!”\nShe heard him chuckling as she dug deeper into the stone. It was more\ndifficult than she’d have imagined. Yes, the Blade cut the rock easily, but\nshe kept cutting sections that just wouldn’t fall out. She had to chop them to\npieces, then dismiss the Blade and grab chunks to pull them out.\nAfter over an hour of frantic work, however, she managed to craft a\nsemblance of a refuge. She didn’t get the cubby hollowed out as deeply as\nshe wanted, but it would have to do. Drained, she crawled back down her\nimprovised ladder one last time and flopped on the chasmfiend’s back amid\nthe rubble. Her arms felt like she’d been lifting something heavy—and\ntechnically she probably had, since climbing meant lifting herself.\n“Done?” Kaladin called up from the chasm floor.\n“No,” Shallan said, “but close enough. I think we might fit.”\nKaladin was silent.\n“You are coming up into the hole I just cut, Kaladin bridgeboy,\nchasmfiend-slayer and gloombringer.” She leaned over the side of the\nchasmfiend to look at him. “We are not having another stupid conversation\nabout you dying in here while I bravely continue on. Understand?”\n“I’m not sure if I can walk, Shallan,” Kaladin said with a sigh. “Let\nalone climb.”\n“You’re going,” Shallan said, “if I have to carry you.”\nHe looked up, then grinned, face covered in dried violet ichor that he’d\nwiped away as best he could. “I’d like to see that.”\n“Come on,” Shallan said, rising with some difficulty herself. Storms,\nshe was tired. She used the Blade to hack a vine off the wall. It took two\nhits to get it free, amusingly. The first severed its soul. Then, dead, it could\nactually be cut by the sword.\nThe upper part withdrew, curling like a corkscrew to get height. She\ntossed down one side of the length she’d cut free. Kaladin took it with one\nhand, and—favoring his bad leg—carefully made his way up to the top of\nthe chasmfiend. Once up, he flopped down beside her, sweat making trails\nthrough the grime on his face. He looked up at the ladder cut into the rock.\n“You’re really going to make me climb that.”\n“Yes,” she said. “For perfectly selfish reasons.”\nHe looked to her.\n“I’m not going to have your last sight in life be a view of me standing in"

It’s\nundignified. On your feet, bridgeboy.”\nIn the distance, she heard a rumbling. Not good…\n“Climb up,” he said.\n“I’m not—”\n“Climb up,” he said more firmly, “and lie down in the cubby, then reach\nyour hand over the edge. Once I near the top, you can help me the last few\nfeet.”\nShe fretted for a moment, then fetched her satchel and made the climb.\nStorms, those handholds were slick. Once up, she crawled into the shallow\ncubby and perched precariously, reaching down with one hand as she\nbraced herself with the other. He looked up at her, then set his jaw and\nstarted climbing.\nHe mostly pulled himself with his hands, wounded leg dangling, the\nother one steadying him. Heavily muscled, his soldier’s arms slowly pulled\nhim up slot by slot.\nBelow, water trickled down the chasm. Then it started to gush.\n“Come on!” she said.\nWind howled through the chasms, a haunting, eerie sound that called\nthrough the many rifts. Like the moaning of spirits long dead. The high\nsound was accompanied by a low, rumbling roar.\nAll around, plants withdrew, vines twisting and pulling tight, rockbuds\nclosing, frillblooms folding away. The chasm hid.\nKaladin grunted, sweating, his face tense with pain and exertion, his\nfingers trembling. He pulled himself up another rung, then reached his hand\nup toward hers.\nThe stormwall hit.\n73. A Thousand Scurrying Creatures\nONE YEAR AGO\nShallan slipped into Balat’s room, holding a short note between her\nfingers.\nBalat spun, standing. He relaxed. “Shallan! You nearly killed me with\nfright.”\nThe small room, like many in the manor house, had open windows with\nsimple reed shutters—those were closed and latched today, as a highstorm\nwas approaching. The last one before the Weeping. Servants outside\npounded on the walls as they affixed sturdy stormshutters over the reed\nones.\nShallan wore one of her new dresses, the expensive kind that Father\nbought for her, after the Vorin style, straight and slim-waisted with a pocket\non the sleeve. A woman’s dress. She also wore the necklace he had given\nher. He liked it when she did that.\nJushu lounged on a chair nearby, rubbing some kind of plant between\nhis fingers, his face distant. He had lost weight during the two years since\nhis creditors had dragged him from the house, though with those sunken\neyes and the scars on his wrists, he still didn’t look much like his twin.\nShallan eyed the bundles Balat had been preparing. “Good thing Father\nnever checks in on you, Balat. Those bundles look so fishy, we could make\na stew out of them.”\nJushu chuckled, rubbing the scar on one wrist with the other hand."

Those bundles look so fishy, we could make\na stew out of them.”\nJushu chuckled, rubbing the scar on one wrist with the other hand.\n“Doesn’t help that he jumps every time a servant so much as sneezes out in\nthe hallway.”\n“Quiet, both of you,” Balat said, eyeing the window where workers\nlocked a stormshutter in place. “This is not a time for levity. Damnation. If\nhe discovers that I’m planning to leave…”\n“He won’t,” Shallan said, unfolding the letter. “He’s too busy getting\nready to parade himself in front of the highprince.”\n“Does it feel odd to anyone else,” Jushu said, “to be this rich? How\nmany deposits of valuable stone are there on our lands?”\nBalat turned back to packing his bundles. “So long as it keeps Father\nhappy, I don’t care.”\nThe problem was, it hadn’t made Father happy. Yes, House Davar was\nnow wealthy—the new quarries provided a fantastic income. Yet, the better\noff they were, the darker Father grew. Walking the hallways grumbling.\nLashing out at servants.\nShallan scanned the letter’s contents.\n“That’s not a pleased face,” Balat said. “They still haven’t been able to\nfind him?”\nShallan shook her head. Helaran had vanished. Really vanished. No\nmore contact, no more letters; even the people he’d been in touch with\nearlier had no idea where he’d gone.\nBalat sat down on one of his bundles. “So what do we do?”\n“You will need to decide,” Shallan said.\n“I have to get out. I have to.” He ran his hand through his hair. “Eylita is\nready to go with me. Her parents are away for the month, visiting Alethkar.\nIt’s the perfect time.”\n“If you can’t find Helaran, then what?”\n“I’ll go to the highprince. His bastard said that he’d listen to anyone\nwilling to speak against Father.”\n“That was years ago,” Jushu said, leaning back. “Father’s in favor now.\nBesides, the highprince is nearly dead; everyone knows it.”\n“It’s our only chance,” Balat said. He stood up. “I’m going to leave.\nTonight, after the storm.”\n“But Father—” Shallan began.\n“Father wants me to ride out and check on some of the villages along\nthe eastern valley. I’ll tell him I’m doing that, but instead I’ll pick up Eylita\nand we’ll ride for Vedenar and go straight to the highprince. By the time\nFather arrives a week later, I’ll have had my say. It might be enough.”\n“And Malise?” Shallan asked. The plan was still for him to take their\nstepmother to safety.\n“I don’t know,” Balat said. “He’s not going to let her go. Maybe once he\nleaves to visit the highprince, you can send her away someplace safe? I\ndon’t know. Either way, I have to go. Tonight.”\nShallan stepped forward, laying a hand on his arm.\n“I’m tired of the fear,” Balat said to her. “I’m tired of being a coward. If"

Time to show it. I won’t just\nrun, spending my life wondering if Father’s minions are hunting us. This\nway… this way it will be over. Decided.”\nThe door slammed open.\nFor all her complaints that Balat was acting suspicious, Shallan jumped\njust as high as he did, letting out a squeak of surprise. It was only Wikim.\n“Storms, Wikim!” Balat said. “You could at least knock or—”\n“Eylita is here,” Wikim said.\n“What?” Balat leaped forward, grabbing his brother. “She wasn’t to\ncome! I was going to pick her up.”\n“Father summoned her,” Wikim said. “She arrived with her handmaid\njust now. He’s speaking with her in the feast hall.”\n“Oh no,” Balat said, shoving Wikim aside, barreling through the door.\nShallan followed, but stopped in the doorway. “Don’t do anything\nfoolish!” she called after him. “Balat, the plan!”\nHe didn’t appear to have heard her.\n“This could be bad,” Wikim said.\n“Or it could be wonderful,” Jushu said from behind them, still lounging.\n“If Father pushes Balat too far, maybe he’ll stop whining and do\nsomething.”\nShallan felt cold as she stepped into the hallway. That coldness… was\nthat panic? Overwhelming panic, so sharp and strong it washed away\neverything else.\nThis had been coming. She’d known this had been coming. They tried to\nhide, they tried to flee. Of course that wouldn’t work.\nIt hadn’t worked with Mother either.\nWikim passed her, running. She stepped slowly. Not because she was\ncalm, but because she felt pulled forward. A slow pace resisted the\ninevitability.\nShe turned up the steps instead of going down to the feast hall. She\nneeded to fetch something.\nIt took only a minute. She soon returned, the pouch given to her long\nago tucked into the safepouch in her sleeve. She walked down the steps and\nto the doorway of the feast hall. Jushu and Wikim waited just outside of it,\nwatching tensely.\nThey made way for her.\nInside the feast hall, there was shouting, of course.\n“You shouldn’t have done this without talking to me!” Balat said. He\nstood before the high table, Eylita at his side, holding to his arm.\nFather stood on the other side of the table, half-eaten meal before him.\n“Talking to you is useless, Balat. You don’t hear.”\n“I love her!”\n“You’re a child,” Father said. “A foolish child without regard for your\nhouse.”\nBad, bad, bad, Shallan thought. Father’s voice was soft. He was most\ndangerous when his voice was soft.\n“You think,” Father continued, leaning forward, palms on the tabletop,\n“I don’t know about your plan to leave?”\nBalat stumbled back. “How?”\nShallan stepped into the room. What is that on the floor? she thought,\nwalking along the wall toward the door into the kitchens. Something"

Something\nblocked the door from closing.\nRain began to pelt the rooftop outside. The storm had come. The guards\nwere in their guardhouse, the servants in their quarters to wait the storm’s\npassing. The family was alone.\nWith the windows closed, the only light in the room was the cool\nillumination of spheres. Father did not have a fire burning in the hearth.\n“Helaran is dead,” Father said. “Did you know that? You can’t find him\nbecause he’s been killed. I didn’t even have to do it. He found his own\ndeath on a battlefield in Alethkar. Idiot.”\nThe words threatened Shallan’s cold calm.\n“How did you find out I was leaving?” Balat demanded. He stepped\nforward, but Eylita held him back. “Who told you?”\nShallan knelt by the obstruction in the kitchen doorway. Thunder\nrumbled, making the building vibrate. The obstruction was a body.\nMalise. Dead from several blows to the head. Fresh blood. Warm\ncorpse. He had killed her recently. Storms. He’d found out about the plan,\nhad sent for Eylita and waited for her to arrive, then killed his wife.\nNot a crime of the moment. He’d murdered her as punishment.\nSo it has come to this, Shallan thought, feeling a strange, detached calm.\nThe lie becomes the truth.\nThis was Shallan’s fault. She stood up and rounded the room toward\nwhere servants had left a pitcher of wine, with cups, for Father.\n“Malise,” Balat said. He hadn’t looked toward Shallan; he was just\nguessing. “She broke down and told you, didn’t she? Damnation. We\nshouldn’t have trusted her.”\n“Yes,” Father said. “She talked. Eventually.”\nBalat’s sword made a whispering rasp as he pulled it from its leather\nsheath. Father’s sword followed.\n“Finally,” Father said. “You show hints of a backbone.”\n“Balat, no,” Eylita said, clinging to him.\n“I won’t fear him any longer, Eylita! I won’t!”\nShallan poured wine.\nThey clashed, Father leaping over the high table, swinging in a two-\nhanded blow. Eylita screamed and scrambled back while Balat swung at his\nfather.\nShallan did not know much of swordplay. She had watched Balat and\nthe others spar, but the only real fights she’d seen were duels at the fair.\nThis was different. This was brutal. Father bashing his sword down\nagain and again toward Balat, who blocked as best he could with his own\nsword. The clang of metal on metal, and above it all the storm. Each blow\nseemed to shake the room. Or was that the thunder?\nBalat stumbled before the onslaught, falling on one knee. Father batted\nthe sword out of Balat’s fingers.\nCould it really be over that quickly? Only seconds had passed. Not like\nthe duels at all.\nFather loomed over his son. “I’ve always despised you,” Father said.\n“The coward. Helaran was noble. He resisted me, but he had passion."

You’ve won.”\n“I always wanted sons,” Father said. “And I got four. All worthless! A\ncoward, a drunkard, and a weakling.” He blinked. “Only Helaran… Only\nHelaran…”\n“Father?” Shallan said. “Here.”\nHe took the wine, gulping it down.\nBalat grabbed his sword. Still on one knee, he struck with a lunge.\nShallan screamed, and the sword made a strange clang as it barely missed\nFather, stabbing through his coat and out the back, connecting with\nsomething metallic.\nFather dropped the cup. It smashed, empty, to the ground. He grunted,\nfeeling at his side. Balat pulled the sword back and stared upward at his\nfather in horror.\nFather’s hand came back with a touch of blood on it, but not much.\n“That’s the best you have?” Father demanded. “Fifteen years of sword\ntraining, and that’s your best attack? Strike at me! Hit me!” He held his\nsword out to the side, raising his other hand.\nBalat started to blubber, sword slipping from his fingers.\n“Bah!” Father said. “Useless.” He tossed his sword onto the high table,\nthen stepped over to the hearth. He grabbed an iron poker, then walked\nback. “Useless.”\nHe slammed the poker down on Balat’s thigh.\n“Father!” Shallan screamed, trying to take his arm. He shoved her aside\nas he struck again, smashing his poker against Balat’s leg.\nBalat screamed.\nShallan hit the ground hard, knocking her head against the floor. She\ncould only hear what happened next. Shouts. The poker connecting with a\nsound like a dull thump. The storm raging above.\n“Why.” Smack. “Can’t.” Smack. “You.” Smack. “Do.” Smack.\n“Anything.” Smack. “Right?”\nShallan’s vision cleared. Father drew deep breaths. Blood had splattered\nhis face. Balat whimpered on the floor. Eylita held to him, face buried in his\nhair. Balat’s leg was a bloody mess.\nWikim and Jushu still stood in the doorway to the hall, looking\nhorrified.\nFather looked to Eylita, murder in his eyes. He raised his poker to\nstrike. But then the weapon slipped from his fingers and clanged to the\nground. He looked at his hand as if surprised, then stumbled. He grabbed\nthe table for support, but fell to his knees, then slumped to the side.\nRain pelted the roof. It sounded like a thousand scurrying creatures\nlooking for a way into the building.\nShallan forced herself to her feet. Coldness. Yes, she recognized that\ncoldness inside of her now. She’d felt it before, on the day when she’d lost\nher mother.\n“Bind Balat’s wounds,” she said, approaching the weeping Eylita. “Use\nhis shirt.”"

Wikim\npeered over her shoulder. “Did Balat’s strike to the side…”\nFather was bleeding there; Shallan could feel it through the clothing. It\nwasn’t nearly bad enough to have caused this though. She shook her head.\n“You gave me something a few years ago,” she said. “A pouch. I kept it.\nYou said it grows more potent over time.”\n“Oh, Stormfather,” Wikim said, raising his hand to his mouth. “The\nblackbane?

Shallan nodded to Eylita, who fetched him some wine.\nUnpoisoned, of course.\nFather was dead. She’d killed him.\n“What is this?” Jushu asked.\n“Don’t do that!” Wikim said. “Storms! You’re going through his pockets\nalready?”\nShallan glanced over to see Jushu pulling something silvery from\nFather’s coat pocket. It was shrouded in a small black bag, mildly wet with\nblood, only pieces of it showing from where Balat’s sword had struck.\n“Oh, Stormfather,” Jushu said, pulling it out. The device consisted of\nseveral chains of silvery metal connecting three large gemstones, one of\nwhich was cracked, its glow lost. “Is this what I think it is?”\n“A Soulcaster,” Shallan said.\n“Prop me up,” Balat said as Eylita returned with the wine. “Please.”\nReluctantly the girl helped him sit. His leg… his leg was not in good\nshape. They would need to get him a surgeon.\nShallan stood, wiping bloodied hands on her dress, and took the\nSoulcaster from Jushu. The delicate metal was broken where the sword had\nstruck it.\n“I don’t understand,” Jushu said. “Isn’t that blasphemy? Don’t those\nbelong to the king, only to be used by ardents?”\nShallan rubbed her thumb across the metal. She couldn’t think.\nNumbness… shock. That was it. Shock.\nI killed Father.\nWikim yelped suddenly, jumping back. “His leg twitched.”\nShallan spun on the body. Father’s fingers spasmed.\n“Voidbringers!” Jushu said. He looked up at the ceiling, and at the\nraging storm. “They’re here. They’re inside of him. It—”"

The eyes trembled, then focused on her.\n“It wasn’t enough,” she whispered. “The poison wasn’t strong enough.”\n“Oh, storms!” Wikim said, kneeling next to her. “He’s still breathing. It\ndidn’t kill him, it just paralyzed him.” His eyes widened. “And he’s\nwaking.”\n“We need to finish the job, then,” Shallan said. She looked to her\nbrothers.\nJushu and Wikim stumbled away, shaking their heads. Balat, dazed, was\nbarely conscious.\nShe turned back to her father. He was looking at her, his eyes moving\neasily now. His leg twitched.\n“I’m sorry,” she whispered, unhooking her necklace. “Thank you for\nwhat you did for me.” She wrapped the necklace around his neck.\nThen she began to twist.\nShe used the handle of one of the forks that had fallen from the table as\nher father tried to steady himself. She looped one side of the closed\nnecklace around it, and in twisting, pulled the chain very tight around\nFather’s throat.\n“Now go to sleep,” she whispered, “in chasms deep, with darkness all\naround you…”\nA lullaby. Shallan spoke the song through her tears—the song he’d sung\nfor her as a child, when she was frightened. Red blood speckled his face\nand covered her hands.\n“Though rock and dread may be your bed, so sleep my baby dear.”\nShe felt his eyes on her. Her skin squirmed as she held the necklace\ntight.\n“Now comes the storm,” she whispered, “but you’ll be warm, the wind\nwill rock your basket…”\nShallan had to watch as his eyes bulged out, his face turning colors. His\nbody trembling, straining, trying to move. The eyes looked to her,\ndemanding, betrayed.\nAlmost, Shallan could imagine that the storm’s howls were part of a\nnightmare. That soon she would awaken in terror, and Father would sing to\nher. As he’d done when she was a child…\n“The crystals fine… will glow sublime…”\nFather stopped moving.\n“And with a song… you’ll sleep… my baby dear.”\n74. Striding the Storm\nYou, however, have never been a force for\nequilibrium. You tow chaos behind you like a\ncorpse dragged by one leg through the snow.\nPlease, hearken to my plea. Leave that place and\njoin me in my oath of nonintervention.\nKaladin caught Shallan’s hand.\nBoulders crashed above, smashing against the plateaus, breaking off\nchunks and tossing them down around him. Wind raged. Water swelled\nbelow, rising toward him. He clung to Shallan, but their wet hands started to\nslip.\nAnd then, in a sudden surge, her grip tightened. With a strength that\nseemed to belie her smaller form, she heaved. Kaladin shoved with his good\nleg as water washed over it, and forced himself up the remaining distance to\njoin her in the rocky alcove.\nThe hollow was barely three or four feet deep, shallower than the crack"

Fortunately, it faced westward. Though icy wind twisted\nabout and sprayed water on them, the brunt of the storm was broken by the\nplateau.\nPuffing, Kaladin pulled against the wall of the alcove, his injured leg\nsmarting like nothing else, Shallan clinging to him. She was a warmth in his\narms, and he held to her as much as she did him, both of them sitting\nhunched against the rock, his head brushing the top of the hollowed hole.\nThe plateau shuddered, quivering like a frightened man. He couldn’t see\nmuch; the blackness was absolute except when lightning came. And the\nsound. Thunder crashing, seemingly disconnected from the sprays of\nlightning. Water roared like an angry beast, and the flashes illuminated a\nfrothing, churning, raging river in the chasm.\nDamnation… it was almost up to their alcove. It had risen fifty or more\nfeet in moments. The dirty water was filled with branches, broken plants,\nvines ripped from their mountings.\n“The sphere?” Kaladin asked in the blackness. “You had a sphere with\nyou for light.”\n“Gone,” she shouted over the roar. “I must have dropped it when I\ngrabbed you!”\n“I didn’t—”\nA crash of thunder, accompanied by a blinding flash of light, sent him\nstuttering. Shallan pulled more tightly against him, fingers digging into his\narm. The light left an afterimage in his eyes.\nStorms. He could swear that afterimage was a face, horribly twisted, the\nmouth pulled open. The next lightning bolt lit the flood just outside with a\nsequence of crackling light, and it showed water bobbing with corpses.\nDozens of them pulled past in the current, dead eyes toward the sky, many\njust empty sockets. Men and Parshendi.\nThe water surged upward, and a few inches of it flooded the chamber.\nThe water of dead men. The storm went dark again, as black as a cavern\nbeneath the ground. Just Kaladin, Shallan, and the bodies.\n“That was,” Shallan said, her head near his, “the most surreal thing I’ve\never seen.”\n“Storms are strange.”\n“You speak from experience?”\n“Sadeas hung me out in one,” he said. “I was supposed to die.”\nThat tempest had tried to rip the skin, then muscles, from his skeleton.\nRain like knives. Lightning like a cauterizing iron.\nAnd a small figure, all white, standing before him with hands forward,\nas if to part the tempest for him. Tiny and frail, yet as strong as the winds\nthemselves.\nSyl… what have I done to you?\n“I need to hear the story,” Shallan said.\n“I’ll tell it to you sometime.”\nWater washed up over them again. For a moment, they became lighter,\nfloating in the sudden burst of water. The current pulled with unexpected\nstrength, as if eager to tow them out into the river.

The river\nretreated, though he could still hear it rushing. They settled back into the\nalcove.\nLight came from above, too steady to be lightning. Something was\nglowing on the plateau. Something that moved. It was hard to see, since\nwater streamed off the side of the plateau above, falling in a sheet before\ntheir refuge. He swore he saw an enormous figure walking up there, a\nglowing inhuman form, followed by another, alien and sleek. Striding the\nstorm. Leg after leg, until the glow passed.\n“Please,” Shallan said. “I need to hear something other than that. Tell\nme.”\nHe shivered, but nodded. Voices. Voices would help. “It started when\nAmaram betrayed me,” he said, tone hushed, just loud enough for her—\npressed close—to hear. “He made me a slave for knowing the truth, that\nhe’d killed my men in his lust to get a Shardblade. That it mattered more to\nhim than his own soldiers, more to him than honor…”\nHe continued on, talking of his days as a slave, of his attempts to\nescape. Of the men he’d gotten killed for trusting him. It gushed from him,\na story he’d never told. Who would he have told it to? Bridge Four had\nlived most of it with him.\nHe told her of the wagon and of Tvlakv—that name earned a gasp. She\napparently knew him. He spoke of the numbness, the… nothing. The\nthinking he should kill himself, but the trouble believing that it was worth\nthe effort.\nAnd then, Bridge Four. He didn’t talk about Syl. Too much pain there\nright now. Instead, he talked of bridge runs, of terror, of death, and of\ndecision.\nRain washed over them, blown in swirls, and he swore he could hear\nchanting out there somewhere. Some kind of strange spren zipped past their\nenclosure, red and violet and reminiscent of lightning. Was that what Syl\nhad seen?\nShallan listened. He would have expected questions from her, but she\ndidn’t ask a single one. No pestering for details, no chattering. She\napparently did know how to be quiet.\nHe got through it all, amazingly. The last bridge run. Rescuing Dalinar.\nHe wanted to spill it all out. He talked about facing the Parshendi\nShardbearer, about how he’d offended Adolin, about holding the bridgehead\non his own…\nWhen he finished, they both let the silence settle on them, and shared\nwarmth. Together, they stared out at the rushing water just out of reach and\nlit by flashing.\n“I killed my father,” Shallan whispered.\nKaladin looked toward her. In a flash of light, he saw her eyes as she\nlooked up from where her head had been resting against his chest, beads of\nwater on her eyelashes. With his hands around her waist, hers around him, it\nwas as close as he’d held a woman since Tarah.\n“My father was a violent, angry man,” Shallan said. “A murderer. I\nloved him.

I killed my own father…”\nHe didn’t prod her, though he wanted to know. Needed to know.\nShe went on, fortunately, speaking of her youth and the terrors she had\nknown. Kaladin had thought his life terrible, but there was one thing he’d\nhad, and perhaps not cherished enough: parents who loved him. Roshone\nhad brought Damnation itself to Hearthstone, but at least Kaladin’s mother\nand father had always been there to rely upon.\nWhat would he have done, if his father had been like the abusive,\nhateful man Shallan described? If his mother had died before his own eyes?\nWhat would he have done if, instead of living off Tien’s light, he had been\nrequired to bring light to the family?\nHe listened with wonder. Storms. Why wasn’t this woman broken, truly\nbroken? She described herself that way, but she was no more broken than a\nspear with a chipped blade—and a spear like that could still be as sharp a\nweapon as any. He preferred one with a score or two on the blade, a worn\nhandle. A spearhead that had known fighting was just… better than a new\none. You could know it had been used by a man fighting for his life, and\nthat it had remained sure and not broken. Marks like those were signs of\nstrength.\nHe did feel a chill as she mentioned her brother Helaran’s death, anger\nin her voice.\nHelaran had been killed in Alethkar. At Amaram’s hands.\nStorms… I killed him, didn’t I? Kaladin thought. The brother she loved.\nHad he told her about that?\nNo. No, he hadn’t mentioned that he’d killed the Shardbearer, only that\nAmaram had killed Kaladin’s men to cover up his lust for the weapon. He’d\ngotten used to, over the years, referencing the event without mentioning that\nhe’d killed a Shardbearer. His first few months as a slave had beaten into\nhim the dangers of talking about an event like that. He hadn’t even realized\nhe’d fallen into that habit of speaking here.\nDid she realize? Had she inferred that Kaladin, not Amaram, had been\nthe one to actually kill the Shardbearer? She didn’t seem to have made that\nconnection. She continued talking, speaking of the night—also during a\nstorm—when she’d poisoned, then murdered her father.\nAlmighty above. This woman was stronger than he’d ever been.\n“And so,” she continued, pressing her head back against his chest, “we\ndecided that I would find Jasnah. She… had a Soulcaster, you see.”\n“You wanted to see if she could fix yours?”\n“That would have been too rational.” He couldn’t see her scowl at\nherself, but he heard it, somehow. “My plan—being stupid and naive—was\nto swap mine for hers and bring back a working one to make money for the\nfamily.”\n“You had never left your family’s lands before.”\n“Yes.”\n“And you went to rob one of the smartest women in the world?”\n“Er… yes. Remember that bit about ‘stupid and naive’? Anyway, Jasnah"

Fortunately, I intrigued her and she agreed to take me on as a\nward. The marriage to Adolin was her idea, a way to protect my family\nwhile I trained.”\n“Huh,” he said. Lightning flashed outside. The winds seemed to be\nbuilding even further, if that was possible, and he had to raise his voice\neven though Shallan was right there. “Generous, for a woman you intended\nto rob.”\n“I think she saw something in me that—”\nSilence.\nKaladin blinked. Shallan was gone. He panicked for a moment,\nsearching about himself, until he realized that his leg no longer hurt and the\nfuzziness in his head—from blood loss, shock, and possible hypothermia—\nwas gone too.\nAh, he thought. This again.\nHe took a deep breath and stood up, stepping out of the blackness to the\nlip of the opening. The stream below had stopped, as if frozen solid, and the\nopening of the alcove—which Shallan had made far too low to stand up in\n—could now hold him standing at full height.\nHe looked out and met the gaze of a face as wide as eternity itself.\n“Stormfather,” Kaladin said. Some named him Jezerezeh, Herald. This\ndidn’t fit what Kaladin had heard of any Herald, however. Was the\nStormfather a spren, perhaps? A god? It seemed to stretch forever, yet he\ncould see it, make out the face in its infinite expanse.\nThe winds had stopped. Kaladin could hear his own heartbeat.\nCHILD OF HONOR. It spoke to him this time. Last time, in the middle\nof the storm, it had not—though it had done so in dreams.\nKaladin looked to the side, again checking to see if Shallan was there,\nbut he couldn’t see her any longer. She wasn’t part of this vision, whatever\nit was.\n“She’s one of them, isn’t she?” he asked. “Of the Knights Radiant, or at\nleast a Surgebinder. That’s what happened when fighting the chasmfiend,\nthat’s how she survived the fall. It wasn’t me either time. It was her.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled.\n“Syl,” Kaladin said, looking back to the face. The plateaus in front of\nhim had vanished. It was just him and the face. He had to ask. It hurt him,\nbut he had to. “What have I done to her?”\nYOU HAVE KILLED HER. The voice shook everything. It was as if…\nas if the shaking of the plateau and his own body made the sounds for the\nvoice.\n“No,” Kaladin whispered. “No!”\nIT HAPPENED AS IT ONCE DID, the Stormfather said, angry. A\nhuman emotion. Kaladin recognized it. MEN CANNOT BE TRUSTED,\nCHILD OF TANAVAST. YOU HAVE TAKEN HER FROM ME. MY\nBELOVED ONE.\nThe face seemed to withdraw, fading.\n“Please!” Kaladin screamed. “How can I fix it? What can I do?”\nIT CANNOT BE FIXED. SHE IS BROKEN. YOU ARE LIKE THE"

Kaladin collapsed back into the alcove, gasping at\nthe sudden restoration of pain and cold.\n“Kelek’s breath!” Shallan said. “What was that?”\n“You saw the face?” Kaladin asked.\n“Yes. So vast… I could see stars in it, stars upon stars, infinity…”\n“The Stormfather,” Kaladin said, tired. He reached around beneath him\nfor something that was suddenly glowing. A sphere, the one Shallan had\ndropped earlier. It had gone dun, but was now renewed.\n“That was amazing,” she whispered. “I need to draw it.”\n“Good luck,” Kaladin said, “in this rain.” As if to punctuate his point,\nanother wave of it washed over them. It would swirl in between the chasms,\ntwisting about and sometimes blowing back at them. They sat in water a\nfew inches deep, but it didn’t threaten to pull them away again.\n“My poor drawings,” Shallan said, pulling her satchel to her breast with\nher safehand as she held to him—the only thing to hold to—with her other.\n“The satchel is waterproof, but… I don’t know that it’s highstorm-proof.”\nKaladin grunted, staring out at the rushing water. There was a\nmesmerizing pattern to it, surging with broken plants and leaves. No\ncorpses, not anymore. The flowing water rose in a large bump before them,\nas if rushing over something large beneath. The chasmfiend’s carcass, he\nrealized, was still wedged down there. It was too heavy for even the flood\nto budge.\nThey fell silent. With light, the need to speak had passed, and though he\nconsidered confronting her about what he was increasingly sure she was, he\nsaid nothing. Once they were free, there would be time.\nFor now, he wanted to think—though he was still glad for her presence.\nAnd aware of it in more ways than one, pushed against him and wearing the\nwet, increasingly tattered dress.\nHis conversation with the Stormfather, however, drew his attention\naway from that sort of thought.\nSyl. Had he really… killed her? He had heard her weeping earlier,\nhadn’t he?\nHe tried, just out of futile experimentation, to pull in some Stormlight.\nHe kind of wanted Shallan to see, to gauge her reaction. It didn’t work, of\ncourse.\nThe storm slowly passed, the floodwaters receding bit by bit. After the\nrains slackened to the level of an ordinary storm, the waters started flowing\nin the other direction. It was as he’d always assumed, though never seen.\nNow rain was falling more on the ground west of the Plains than on the\nPlains themselves, and the drainage was all to the east.

The river churned—\nfar more lethargically—back out the way it had come.\nThe chasmfiend’s corpse emerged from the river. Then, finally, the flood\nwas done—the river reduced to a trickle, the rain a drizzle. The drops that\ndripped from the plateaus above were far larger and heavier than the rain\nitself.\nHe shifted to move to climb down, but realized that Shallan, curled up\nagainst him, had fallen asleep. She snored softly.\n“You must be the only person,” he whispered, “to ever fall asleep while\noutside in a highstorm.”\nUncomfortable though he was, he realized he really didn’t fancy the\nidea of climbing down with this wounded leg. Strength sapped, feeling a\ncrushing darkness at what the Stormfather had said about Syl, he let himself\nsuccumb to the numbness, and fell asleep.\nShallan’s Sketchbook: Chasmfiend\n75. True Glory\nThe cosmere itself may depend upon our\nrestraint.\n“At least speak with him, Dalinar,” Amaram said. The man walked\nquickly to match Dalinar’s pace, his cloak of the Knights Radiant billowing\nbehind him, as they inspected the lines of troops loading up wagons with\nsupplies for the trip out onto the Shattered Plains. “Come to an\naccommodation with Sadeas before you leave. Please.”\nDalinar, Navani, and Amaram passed a group of spearmen running to\nget into place with their battalion, which was counting ranks. Just beyond\nthem, the men and women of the camp acted similarly excited. Cremlings\nscuttled this way and that, moving through pools of water left by the storm.\nLast night’s highstorm was the final one of the season. Sometime\ntomorrow, the Weeping would begin. Wet though it would be, it provided a\nwindow. Safety from storms, time to strike out. He planned to leave by\nmidday.\n“Dalinar?” Amaram asked. “Will you talk to him?”\nCareful, Dalinar thought. Don’t make any judgments just yet. This had\nto be done with precision. At his side, Navani eyed him. He’d shared his\nplans regarding Amaram with her.\n“I—” Dalinar began.\nA series of horns interrupted him, blaring above through the camp. They\nseemed more urgent than usual. A chrysalis had been spotted. Dalinar\ncounted the rhythms, placing the plateau location.\n“Too far,” he said, pointing to one of his scribes, a tall, lanky woman\nthat often helped Navani with her experiments. “Who is on the schedule for\ntoday’s runs?”\n“Highprinces Sebarial and Roion, sir,” the scribe said, consulting her\nledger.\nDalinar grimaced. Sebarial never sent troops, even when commanded.\nRoion was slow. “Send the signal flags to tell those two the gemheart is too\nfar out to try for. We’ll be marching for the Parshendi camp later today, and\nI can’t have some of our troops splitting off and running for a gemheart.”\nHe made the order as if either man would commit any troops to his"

Navani pointed to\na group of scribes who were tabulating supply lists, and he nodded,\nstopping while she walked over to talk to the women and get an estimate on\nreadiness.\n“Sadeas won’t like a gemheart being left unharvested,” Amaram said as\nthe two of them waited. “When he hears you called off the run, he’ll send\nhis own troops for it.”\n“Sadeas will do as he wishes, regardless of my intervention.”\n“Each time you allow him to disobey openly,” Amaram said, “it drives a\nwedge between him and the Throne.” Amaram took Dalinar by the arm.\n“We have bigger problems than you and Sadeas, my friend. Yes, he\nbetrayed you. Yes, he likely will again. But we can’t afford to let the two of\nyou go to war. The Voidbringers are coming.”\n“How can you be certain of that, Amaram?” Dalinar asked.\n“Instinct. You gave me this title, this position, Dalinar. I can feel\nsomething from the Stormfather himself. I know that a disaster is coming.\nAlethkar needs to be strong. That means you and Sadeas working together.”\nDalinar shook his head slowly. “No. The opportunity for Sadeas to work\nwith me has long since passed. The road to unity in Alethkar is not at the\ntable of negotiation, it’s out there.”\nAcross the plateaus, to the Parshendi camp, wherever it was. An end to\nthis war. Closure for both him and his brother.\nUnite them.\n“Sadeas wants you to try this expedition,” Amaram said. “He’s certain\nyou will fail.”\n“And when I do not,” Dalinar said, “he will lose all credibility.”\n“You don’t even know where you’ll find the Parshendi!” Amaram said,\nthrowing his hands into the air. “What are you going to do, just wander out\nthere until you run across them?”\n“Yes.”\n“Madness. Dalinar, you appointed me to this position—an impossible\nposition, mind you—with the charge to be a light to all nations. I’m finding\nit hard to even get you to listen to me. Why should anyone else?”\nDalinar shook his head, looking eastward, over those broken plains. “I\nhave to go, Amaram. The answers are out there, not here. It’s like we\nwalked all the way to the shore, then huddled there for years, peering out at\nthe waters but afraid to get wet.”\n“But—”\n“Enough.”\n“Eventually, you’re going to have to give away authority and let it stay\ngiven, Dalinar,” Amaram said softly. “You can’t hold it all, pretending you\naren’t in charge, but then ignore orders and advice as if you were.”\nThe words, problematically truthful, slapped him hard.

A surgeon was yelling for them to back up and\ngive him room.\nSome of the men saw Dalinar and saluted, hastily pulling out of the\nway. The blue parted like waters blown in a storm.\nAnd there he was. Ragged, hair matted in snarls, face scratched and leg\nwrapped in an improvised bandage. He sat on a triage table and had\nremoved his uniform coat, which sat on the table beside him, tied into a\nround bundle with what looked like a vine wrapping it.\nKaladin looked up as Dalinar approached, and then moved to pull\nhimself to his feet.\n“Soldier, don’t—” Dalinar began, but Kaladin didn’t listen. He hauled\nhimself up tall, using a spear to support his bad leg. Then he raised hand to\nbreast, a slow motion, as if the arm were tied with weights. It was, Dalinar\nfigured, the most tired salute he’d ever seen.\n“Sir,” Kaladin said. Exhaustionspren puffed around Kaladin like little\njets of dust.\n“How…” Dalinar said. “You fell into a chasm!”\n“I fell face-first, sir,” Kaladin said, “and fortunately, I’m particularly\nhard-headed.”\n“But…”\nKaladin sighed, leaning on his spear. “I’m sorry, sir. I don’t really know\nhow I survived. Some spren were involved, we think. Anyway, I hiked back\nthrough the chasms. I had a duty to see to.” He nodded to the side.\nFarther into the triage tent, Dalinar saw something he hadn’t originally\nnoticed. Shallan Davar—a tangle of red hair and ripped clothing—sat amid\na pack of surgeons.\n“One future daughter-in-law,” Kaladin said, “delivered safe and sound.\nSorry about the damage done to the packaging.”\n“But there was a highstorm!” Dalinar said.\n“We really wanted to get back before that,” Kaladin said. “Ran into\nsome troubles along the way, I’m afraid.” With lethargic movements, he\ntook out his side knife and cut the vines off the package beside him. “You"

        "text": "some troubles along the way, I’m afraid.” With lethargic movements, he\ntook out his side knife and cut the vines off the package beside him. “You\nknow how everyone kept saying there was a chasmfiend prowling about in\nthe nearby chasms?”\n“Yes…”\nKaladin lifted the remnants of his coat away from the table, revealing a\nmassive green gemstone. Though bulbous and uncut, the gemheart shone\nwith a powerful inner light.\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said, taking the gemheart in one hand and tossing it to\nthe ground before Dalinar. “We took care of that for you, sir.” In the blink\nof an eye, gloryspren replaced his exhaustionspren.\nDalinar stared mutely at the gemheart as it rolled and tapped against the\nfront of his boot, its light almost blinding.\n“Oh, don’t be so melodramatic, bridgeman,” Shallan called. “Brightlord\nDalinar, we found the beast already dead and rotting in the chasm. We\nsurvived the highstorm by climbing up its back to a crack in the side of the\nplateau, where we waited out the rains. We could only get the gemheart out\nbecause the thing was half-rotted already.”\nKaladin looked to her, frowning. He turned back to Dalinar almost\nimmediately. “Yes,” Kaladin said. “That’s what happened.”\nHe was a far worse liar than Shallan was.\nAmaram and Navani finally arrived, the former having remained behind\nto escort the latter. Navani gasped when she saw Shallan, then ran to her,\nsnapping angrily at the surgeons. She fussed and bustled around Shallan,\nwho seemed far less the worse for wear than Kaladin, despite the terrible\nstate of her dress and hair. In moments, Navani had Shallan wrapped in a\nblanket to cover her exposed skin, then she sent a runner back to prepare a\nwarm bath and meal at Dalinar’s complex, to be had in whichever order\nShallan wished.\nDalinar found himself smiling. Navani pointedly ignored Shallan’s\nprotests that none of this was necessary. The mother axehound had finally\nemerged. Shallan was apparently no longer an outsider, but one of Navani’s\nclutch—and Chana help the man or woman who stood between Navani and\none of her own.\n“Sir,” Kaladin said, finally letting the surgeons settle him back on the\ntable. “The soldiers are gathering supplies. The battalions forming up. Your\nexpedition?”\n“You needn’t worry, soldier,” Dalinar said. “I could hardly expect you\nto guard me in your state.”\n“Sir,” Kaladin said, more softly, “Brightness Shallan found something\nout there. Something you need to know. Talk to her before you set out.”\n“I’ll do so,” Dalinar said. He waited for a moment, then waved the\nsurgeons aside. Kaladin seemed to be in no immediate danger. Dalinar\nstepped closer, leaning in. “Your men waited for you, Stormblessed. They\nskipped meals, pulled triple shifts. I half think they’d have sat out here, at\nthe head of the chasms, through the highstorm itself if I hadn’t intervened.”\n“They are good men,” Kaladin said."

I half think they’d have sat out here, at\nthe head of the chasms, through the highstorm itself if I hadn’t intervened.”\n“They are good men,” Kaladin said.\n“It’s more than that. They knew you would return. What is it they\nunderstand about you that I don’t?”\nKaladin met his eyes.\n“I’ve been searching for you, haven’t I?” Dalinar said. “All this time,\nwithout seeing it.”\nKaladin looked away. “No, sir. Maybe once, but… I’m just what you\nsee, and not what you think. I’m sorry.”\nDalinar grunted, inspecting Kaladin’s face. He had almost thought…\nBut perhaps not.\n“Give him anything he wants or needs,” Dalinar said to the surgeons,\nletting them approach. “This man is a hero. Again.”\nHe withdrew, letting the bridgemen crowd around—which, of course,\nstarted the surgeons cursing at them again. Where had Amaram gone? The\nman had been here just a few minutes ago. As the palanquin arrived for\nShallan, Dalinar decided to follow and find out just what it was that Kaladin\nsaid the girl knew.\n* * *\nOne hour later, Shallan snuggled into a nest of warm blankets, wet hair\non her neck, smelling of flowered perfume. She wore one of Navani’s\ndresses—which was too big for her. She felt like a child in her mother’s\nclothing. That was, perhaps, exactly what she was. Navani’s sudden\naffection was unexpected, but Shallan would certainly accept it.\nThe bath had been glorious. Shallan wanted to curl up on this couch and\nsleep for ten days. For the moment, however, she let herself revel in the\ndistinctive feeling of being clean, warm, and safe for the first time in what\nseemed like an eternity.\n“You can’t take her, Dalinar.” Navani’s voice came from Pattern on the\ntable beside Shallan’s couch. She didn’t feel a moment’s guilt for sending\nhim to spy on the two of them while she bathed. After all, they had been\ntalking about her.\n“This map…” Dalinar’s voice said.\n“She can draw you a better map and you can take it.”\n“She can’t draw what she hasn’t seen, Navani. She’ll need to be there,\nwith us, to draw out the center of the pattern on the Plains once we\npenetrate in that direction.”\n“Someone else—”\n“Nobody else has been able to do this,” Dalinar said, sounding awed.\n“Four years, and none of our scouts or cartographers saw the pattern. If\nwe’re going to find the Parshendi, I’m going to need her. I’m sorry.”\nShallan winced. She was not doing a very good job of keeping her\ndrawing ability hidden.\n“She just got back from that terrible place,” Navani’s voice said.\n“I won’t let a similar accident occur. She will be safe.”\n“Unless you all die,” Navani snapped. “Unless this entire expedition is a\ndisaster. Then everything will be taken from me. Again.” Pattern stopped,\nthen spoke further in his own voice. “He held her at this point, and"

From there, they got very close and\nmade some interesting noises. I can reproduce—”\n“No,” Shallan said, blushing. “Too private.”\n“Very well.”\n“I need to go with them,” Shallan said. “I need to complete that map of\nthe Shattered Plains and find some way to correlate it with the ancient ones\nof Stormseat.”\nIt was the only way to find the Oathgate. Assuming it wasn’t destroyed\nin whatever shattered the Plains, Shallan thought. And, if I do find it, will I\neven be able to open it? Only one of the Knights Radiant was said to be\nable to open the pathway.\n“Pattern,” she said softly, clutching a mug of warmed wine, “I’m not a\nRadiant, right?”\n“I do not think so,” he said. “Not yet. There is more to do, I believe,\nthough I cannot be certain.”\n“How can you not know?”\n“I was not me when the Knights Radiant existed. It is complex to\nexplain. I have always existed. We are not ‘born’ as men are, and we cannot\ntruly die as men do. Patterns are eternal, as is fire, as is the wind. As are all\nspren. Yet, I was not in this state. I was not… aware.”\n“You were a mindless spren?” Shallan said. “Like the ones that gather\naround me when I draw?”\n“Less than that,” Pattern said. “I was… everything. In everything. I\ncannot explain it. Language is insufficient. I would need numbers.”\n“Surely there are others among you, though,” Shallan said. “Older\nCryptics? Who were alive back then?”\n“No,” Pattern said softly. “None who experienced the bond.”\n“Not a single one?”\n“All dead,” Pattern said. “To us, this means they are mindless—as a\nforce cannot truly be destroyed. These old ones are patterns in nature now,\nlike Cryptics unborn. We have tried to restore them. It does not work.\nMmmm. Perhaps if their knights still lived, something could be done…”\nStormfather. Shallan pulled the blanket around her closer. “An entire\npeople, all killed?”\n“Not just one people,” Pattern said, solemn. “Many. Spren with minds\nwere less plentiful then, and the majorities of several spren peoples were all\nbonded. There were very few survivors. The one you call Stormfather lived.\nSome others. The rest, thousands of us, were killed when the event\nhappened. You call it the Recreance.”\n“No wonder you’re certain I will kill you.”\n“It is inevitable,” Pattern said. “You will eventually betray your oaths,\nbreaking my mind, leaving me dead—but the opportunity is worth the cost.\nMy kind is too static. We always change, yes, but we change in the same\nway. Over and over. It is difficult to explain. You, though, you are vibrant.\nComing to this place, this world of yours, I had to give up many things. The\ntransition was… traumatic. My memory returns slowly, but I am pleased at\nthe chance. Yes. Mmm.”"

Mmm.”\n“Only a Radiant can open the pathway,” Shallan said, then took a sip of\nher wine. She liked the warmth it built inside of her. “But we don’t know\nwhy, or how. Maybe I’ll count as enough of a Radiant to make it work.”\n“Perhaps,” Pattern said. “Or you could progress. Become more. There is\nsomething more you must do.”\n“Words?” Shallan said.\n“You have said the Words,” Pattern said. “You said them long ago.\nNo… it is not words that you lack. It is truth.”\n“You prefer lies.”\n“Mmm. Yes, and you are a lie. A powerful one. However, what you do\nis not just lie. It is truth and lie mixed. You must understand both.”\nShallan sat in thought, finishing her wine, until the door to the sitting\nroom burst open, letting in Adolin. He stopped, wild-eyed, regarding her.\nShallan stood up, smiling. “It appears that I have failed at properly—”\nShe cut off as he grabbed her in an embrace. Drat. She’d had a perfectly\nclever quip prepared too. She’d worked on it during the entire bath.\nStill, it was nice to be held. This was the most physically forward he’d\never been. Surviving an impossible journey did have its benefits. She let\nherself wrap her arms around him, feel the muscles on his back through his\nuniform, breathe in his cologne. He held her for several heartbeats. Not\nenough. She twisted her head and forced a kiss, her mouth enclosing his,\nfirm in his embrace.\nAdolin melted into the kiss, and did not pull back. Eventually, though,\nthe perfect moment ended. Adolin took her head in his hands, looking into\nher eyes, and smiled. Then he grabbed her in another hug and laughed that\nbarking, exuberant laugh of his. A real laugh, the one of which she was so\nfond.\n“Where were you?” she asked.\n“Visiting the other highprinces,” Adolin said, “one at a time and\ndelivering Father’s final ultimatum—to join us in this assault, or forever be\nknown as those who refused to see the Vengeance Pact fulfilled. Father\nthought giving me something to do would help distract me from… well,\nyou.”\nHe leaned back, holding her by the arms, and gave her a silly grin.\n“I have pictures to draw for you,” Shallan said, grinning back. “I saw a\nchasmfiend.”\n“A dead one, right?”\n“Poor thing.”\n“Poor thing?” Adolin said, laughing. “Shallan, if you’d seen a live one,\nyou’d have surely been killed!”\n“Almost surely.”\n“I still can’t believe… I mean, you fell. I should have saved you.\nShallan, I’m sorry. I ran for Father first—”\n“You did what you should have,” she said. “No person on that bridge\nwould have had you rescue one of us instead of your father.”\nHe embraced her once more. “Well, I won’t let it happen again. Nothing"

We’ll have to make it so that you aren’t ever in that kind of\nposition again.”\nShe pulled away from him.\n“Shallan?” Adolin said. “Don’t worry, they won’t get to you. I’ll protect\nyou. I—”\n“Don’t say things like that,” she hissed.\n“What?” He ran his hand through his hair.\n“Just don’t,” Shallan said, shivering.\n“The man who did this, who threw that lever, is dead now,” Adolin said.\n“Is that what you’re worried about? He was poisoned before we could get\nanswers—though we’re sure he belonged to Sadeas—but you don’t need to\nworry about him.”\n“I will worry about what I wish to worry about,” Shallan said. “I don’t\nneed to be protected.”\n“But—”\n“I don’t!” Shallan said. She breathed in and out, calming herself. She\nreached out and took him by the hand. “I won’t be locked away again,\nAdolin.”\n“Again?”\n“It’s not important.” Shallan raised his hand and wove his fingers\nbetween her own. “I appreciate the concern. That’s all that matters.”\nBut I won’t let you, or anyone else, treat me like a thing to be hidden\naway. Never, never again.\nDalinar opened the door into his study, letting Navani pass through first,\nthen followed her into the room. Navani looked serene, her face a mask.\n“Child,” Dalinar said to Shallan, “I have a somewhat difficult request to\nmake of you.”\n“Anything you wish, Brightlord,” Shallan said, bowing. “But I do wish\nto make a request of you in turn.”\n“What is it?”\n“I need to accompany you on your expedition.”\nDalinar smiled, shooting a glance at Navani. The older woman did not\nreact. She can be so good with her emotions, Shallan thought. I can’t even\nread what she’s thinking. That would be a useful skill to learn.\n“I believe,” Shallan said, looking back to Dalinar, “that the ruins of an\nancient city are hidden on the Shattered Plains. Jasnah was searching for\nthem. So, then, must I.”\n“This expedition will be dangerous,” Navani said. “You understand the\nrisks, child?”\n“Yes.”\n“One would think,” Navani continued, “that considering your recent\nordeal, you would wish for a time of shelter.”\n“Uh, I wouldn’t say things like that to her, Aunt,” Adolin said,\nscratching at his head. “She’s kind of funny about them.”\n“It is not a matter of humor,” Shallan said, lifting her head high. “I have\na duty.”\n“Then I shall allow it,” Dalinar said. He liked anything having to do\nwith duty.\n“And your request of me?” Shallan asked him."

He liked anything having to do\nwith duty.\n“And your request of me?” Shallan asked him.\n“This map,” Dalinar said, crossing the room and holding up the crinkled\nmap detailing her path back through the chasms. “Navani’s scholars say this\nis as accurate as any map we have. You can truly expand this? Deliver a\nmap of the entire Shattered Plains?”\n“Yes.” Particularly if she used what she remembered of Amaram’s map\nto fill in some details. “But Brightlord, might I make a suggestion?”\n“Speak.”\n“Leave your parshmen behind in the warcamp,” she said.\nHe frowned.\n“I cannot accurately explain why,” Shallan said, “but Jasnah felt that\nthey were dangerous. Particularly to bring out onto the Plains. If you wish\nmy help, if you trust me to create this map for you, then trust me on this one\nsingle point. Leave the parshmen. Conduct this expedition without them.”\nDalinar looked to Navani, who shrugged. “Once our things are packed,\nthey won’t be needed really. The only ones inconvenienced will be the\nofficers, who will have to set up their own tents.”\nDalinar considered, chewing on her request. “This comes from Jasnah’s\nnotes?” Dalinar asked.\nShallan nodded. To the side, blessedly, Adolin piped in. “She’s told me\nsome of it, Father. You should listen to her.”\nShallan shot him a grateful smile.\n“Then it shall be done,” Dalinar said. “Gather your things and send\nword to your uncle Sebarial, Brightness. We’re leaving within the hour.\nWithout parshmen.”\nTHE END OF\nPart Four\nInterludes\nI-12. Lhan\n“Congratulations,” Brother Lhan said. “You have found your way to the\neasiest job in the world.”\nThe young ardent pursed her lips, looking him up and down. She had\nobviously not expected her new mentor to be rotund, slightly drunk, and\nyawning.\n“You are the… senior ardent I’ve been assigned to?”\n“‘To whom I’ve been assigned,’” Brother Lhan corrected, putting an\narm around the young woman’s shoulders. “You’re going to have to learn\nhow to speak punctiliously. Queen Aesudan likes to feel that those around\nher are refined. It makes her feel refined by association. My job is to mentor\nyou on these items.”\n“I have been an ardent here in Kholinar for over a year,” the woman\nsaid. “I hardly think that I need mentoring at all—”\n“Yes, yes,” Brother Lhan said, guiding her out of the monastery’s\nentryway. “It’s just that, you see, your superiors say you might need a little\nextra direction. Being assigned to the queen’s own retinue is a marvelous\nprivilege! One, I understand, you have requested with some measure of…\nah… persistence.”\nShe walked with him, and each step revealed her reluctance. Or perhaps\nconfusion.

An\neleventh lamp represented the Tranquiline Halls, and a large ceremonial\nkeyhole set into the wall represented the need for ardents to ignore borders,\nand look only at the hearts of men… or something like that. He wasn’t sure,\nhonestly.\nOutside the Circle of Memories, they entered one of the covered\nwalkways between monastery buildings, a light rain sprinkling the rooftops.\nThe last leg of the walkways, the sunwalk, gave a wonderful view of\nKholinar—at least on a clear day. Even today, Lhan could see much of the\ncity, as both the temple and the high palace occupied a flat-topped hill.\nSome said that the Almighty himself had drawn Kholinar in rock,\nscooping out sections of ground with a fluent finger. Lhan wondered how\ndrunk he’d been at the time. Oh, the city was beautiful, but it was the\nbeauty of an artist who wasn’t quite right in the mind. The rock took the\nshape of rolling hills and steeply sloping valleys, and when the stone was\ncut into, it exposed thousands of brilliant strata of red, white, yellow, and\norange.\nThe most majestic formations were the windblades—enormous, curving\nspines of rock that cut through the city. Beautifully lined with colorful strata\non the sides, they curved, curled, rose, and fell unpredictably, like fish\nleaping from the ocean. Supposedly, this all had to do with how the winds\nblew through the area. He did mean to get around to studying why that was.\nOne of these days.\nSlippered feet fell softly on glossy marble, accompanying the sound of\nthe rains, as Lhan escorted the girl—what was her name again? “Look at\nthat city,” he said. “Everyone out there has to work, even the lighteyes.\nBread to bake, lands to oversee, cobblestones to… ah… cobble? No, that’s\nshoes. Damnation. What do you call people who cobble, but don’t actually\ncobble?”\n“I don’t know,” the young woman said softly.\n“Well, it’s no matter to us. You see, we have only one job, and it’s an\neasy one. To serve the queen.”\n“That is not easy work.”\n“But it is!” Lhan said. “So long as we’re all serving the same way. In a\nvery… ah… careful way.”\n“We are sycophants,” the young woman said, staring out over the city.\n“The queen’s ardents tell her only what she wants to hear.”\n“Ah, and here we are, at the point of the matter.” Lhan patted her on the\narm. What was her name again? They’d told it to him…\nPai. Not a very Alethi name; she’d probably chosen it upon being made\nan ardent. It happened. A new life, a new name, often a simple one.\n“You see, Pai,” he said, watching to notice if she reacted. Yes, it did\nseem he’d gotten the name right. His memory must be improving. “This is\nwhat your superiors wanted me to talk to you about. They fear that if you’re\nnot properly instructed, you might cause a bit of a storm here in Kholinar."

They fear that if you’re\nnot properly instructed, you might cause a bit of a storm here in Kholinar.\nNobody wants that.”\nHe and Pai passed other ardents along the sunwalk, and Lhan nodded to\nthem. The queen had a lot of ardents. A lot of ardents.\n“Here’s the thing,” Lhan said. “The queen… she sometimes worries that\nmaybe the Almighty isn’t pleased with her.”\n“Rightly so,” Pai said. “She—”\n“Hush, now,” Lhan said, wincing. “Just… hush. Listen. The queen\nfigures that if she treats her ardents well, it will buy her favor with the One\nwho makes the storms, so to speak. Nice food. Nice robes. Fantastic\nquarters. Lots of free time to do whatever we want. We get these things as\nlong as she thinks she’s on the right path.”\n“Our duty is to give her the truth.”\n“We do!” Lhan said. “She’s the Almighty’s chosen, isn’t she? Wife of\nKing Elhokar, ruler while he’s off fighting a holy war of retribution against\nthe regicides on the Shattered Plains. Her life is very hard.”\n“She throws feasts every night,” Pai whispered. “She engages in\ndebauchery and excess. She wastes money while Alethkar languishes.\nPeople in outer towns starve as they send food here, with the understanding\nthat it will be passed on to soldiers who need it. It rots because the queen\ncan’t be bothered.”\n“They have plenty of food on the Shattered Plains,” Lhan said.\n“They’ve got gemstones coming out of their ears there. And nobody is\nstarving here either. You’re exaggerating. Life is good.”\n“It is if you’re the queen or one of her lackeys. She even canceled the\nBeggars’ Feasts. It is reprehensible.”\nLhan groaned inside. This one… this one was going to be hard. How to\npersuade her? He wouldn’t want the child to do anything that endangered\nher. Or, well, him. Mostly him.\nThey entered the palace’s grand eastern hall. The carved pillars here\nwere considered one of the greatest artworks of all time, and one could\ntrace their history back to before the shadowdays. The gilding on the floor\nwas ingenious—a lustrous gold that had been placed beneath Soulcast\nribbons of crystal. It ran like rivulets between floor mosaics. The ceiling\nhad been decorated by Oolelen himself, the great ardent painter, and\ndepicted a storm blowing in from the east.\nAll of this could have been crem in the gutter for the reverence Pai gave\nit. She seemed to see only the ardents strolling about, contemplating the\nbeauty. And eating. And composing new poems for Her Majesty—though\nhonestly, Lhan avoided that sort of thing. It seemed like work.\nPerhaps Pai’s attitude came from a residual jealousy. Some ardents were\nenvious of the queen’s personal chosen. He tried to explain some of the\nluxuries that were now hers: warm baths, horseback riding using the\nqueen’s personal stables, music and art…\nPai’s expression grew darker with each item. Bother. This wasn’t\nworking. New plan."

This wasn’t\nworking. New plan.\n“Here,” Lhan said, steering her toward the steps. “There’s something I\nwant to show you.”\nThe steps twisted down through the palace complex. He loved this\nplace, every bit of it. White stone walls, golden sphere lamps, and an age.\nKholinar had never been sacked. It was one of the few eastern cities that\nhadn’t suffered that fate in the chaos after the Hierocracy’s fall. The palace\nhad burned once, but that fire had died out after consuming the eastern\nwing. Rener’s miracle, it was called. The arrival of a highstorm to put out\nthe fire. Lhan swore the place still smelled of smoke, three hundred years\nlater. And…\nOh, right. The girl. They continued down the steps and eventually\nentered the palace kitchens. Lunch had ended, though that didn’t stop Lhan\nfrom snatching a plate of fried bread, Herdazian style, from the counter as\nthey passed. Plenty was laid out for the queen’s favorites, who might find\nthemselves peckish at any time. Being a proper sycophant could work up an\nappetite.\n“Trying to lure me with exotic foods?” Pai asked. “For the past five\nyears, I have eaten only a bowl of boiled tallew for each meal, with a piece\nof fruit on special occasions. This will not tempt me.”\nLhan stopped in place. “You’re not serious, are you?”\nShe nodded.\n“What is wrong with you?”\nShe blushed. “I am of the Devotary of Denial. I wished to experience\nseparation from the physical needs of my—”\n“This is worse than I thought,” Lhan said, taking her by the hand and\npulling her through the kitchens. Near the back, they found the door leading\nout to the service yard, where supplies were delivered and refuse taken\naway. There, shaded from the rain by an awning, they found piles of\nuneaten food.\nPai gasped. “Such waste! You bring me here to convince me not to\nmake a storm? You are doing quite the opposite!”\n“There used to be an ardent who took all of this and distributed it to the\npoor,” Lhan said. “She died a few years back. Since then, the others have\nmade some effort to take care of it. Not much, but some. The food does get\ntaken away eventually, usually dumped into the square to be picked through\nby beggars. It’s mostly rotten by then.”\nStorms. He could almost feel the heat of her anger.\n“Now,” Lhan said, “if there were an ardent among us whose only\nhunger was to do good, think how much she could accomplish. Why, she\ncould feed hundreds just from what is wasted.”\nPai eyed the piles of rotting fruit, the sacks of open grain, now ruined in\nthe rain.\n“Now,” Lhan said, “let us contemplate the opposite. If some ardent tried\nto take away that which we have… well, what might happen to her?”\n“Is that a threat?” she asked softly. “I do not fear physical harm.”"

Don’t be dense. We’re not going to\nhurt you. Too much work.” He shivered. “You’d get sent away, quickly and\nquietly.”\n“I do not fear that either.”\n“I doubt you fear anything,” Lhan said, “except maybe having a little\nfun. But what good would it do anyone if you were sent away? Our lives\nwouldn’t change, the queen would remain the same, and that food out there\nwould still spoil. But if you stay, you can do good. Who knows, maybe your\nexample will help all of us reform, eh?”\nHe patted her on the shoulder. “Think about it for a few minutes. I want\nto go finish my bread.” He wandered off, checking over his shoulder a few\ntimes. Pai settled down beside the heaps of rotting food and stared at them.\nShe didn’t seem bothered by the ripe odor.\nLhan watched her from inside until he got bored. When he got back\nfrom his afternoon massage, she was still there. He ate dinner in the\nkitchen, which wasn’t terribly luxurious. The girl was entirely too interested\nin those heaps of garbage.\nFinally, as evening fell, he ambled back to her.\n“Don’t you even wonder?” she asked, staring at those piles of refuse,\nrain pattering just beyond. “Don’t you stop to think about the cost of your\ngluttony?”\n“Cost?” he asked. “I told you nobody starves because we—”\n“I don’t mean the monetary cost,” she whispered. “I mean the spiritual\ncost. To you, to those around you. Everything’s wrong.”\n“Oh, it’s not that bad,” he said, settling down.\n“It is. Lhan, it’s bigger than the queen, and her wasteful feasts. It wasn’t\nmuch better before that, with King Gavilar’s hunts and the wars, princedom\nagainst princedom. The people hear of the glory of the battle on the\nShattered Plains, of the riches there, but none of it ever materializes here.\n“Does anyone among the Alethi elite care about the Almighty anymore?\nSure, they curse by his name. Sure, they talk about the Heralds, burn\nglyphwards. But what do they do? Do they change their lives? Do they\nlisten to the Arguments? Do they transform, recasting their souls into\nsomething greater, something better?”\n“They have Callings,” Lhan said, fidgeting with his fingers. Digiting,\nthen? “The devotaries help.”\nShe shook her head. “Why don’t we hear from Him, Lhan? The Heralds\nsaid we defeated the Voidbringers, that Aharietiam was the great victory for\nmankind. But shouldn’t He have sent them to speak with us, to counsel us?\nWhy didn’t they come during the Hierocracy and denounce us?

This conversation was\ngetting worse and worse.\n“I don’t know what I’m suggesting,” she whispered. “Only that\nsomething is wrong. All of this is just so very wrong.” She looked to him,\nthen climbed to her feet. “I have accepted your proposal.”\n“You have?”\n“I will not leave Kholinar,” she said. “I will stay here and do what good\nI can.”\n“You won’t get the other ardents into trouble?”\n“My problem is not with the ardents,” she said, offering a hand to help\nhim to his feet. “I will simply try to be a good example for all to follow.”\n“Well, then. That seems like a fine choice.”\nShe walked off, and he dabbed his head. She hadn’t promised, not\nexactly. He wasn’t certain how worried he should be about that.\nTurned out, he should have been very worried.\nThe next morning, he stumbled into the People’s Hall—a large, open\nbuilding in the shadow of the palace where the king or queen addressed the\nconcerns of the masses. A murmuring crowd of horrified ardents stood just\ninside the perimeter.\nLhan had already heard, but he had to see for himself. He forced his\nway to the front. Pai knelt on the floor here, head bowed. She’d painted all\nnight, apparently, writing glyphs on the floor by spherelight. Nobody had\nnoticed. The place was usually locked up tight when not in use, and she’d\nstarted working well after everyone was either asleep or drunk.\nTen large glyphs, written directly on the stone of the floor running up to\nthe dais with the king’s Common Throne. The glyphs listed the ten foolish\nattributes, as represented by the ten fools. Beside each glyph was a written\nparagraph in women’s script explaining how the queen exemplified each of\nthe fools.\nLhan read with horror. This… this didn’t just chastise. It was a\ncondemnation of the entire government, of the lighteyes, and of the Throne\nitself!\nPai was executed the very next morning.\nThe riots started that evening.\nI-13. A Part to Play\nThat voice deep within Eshonai still screamed. Even when she didn’t\nattune the old Rhythm of Peace. She kept herself busy to quiet it, walking\nthe perfectly circular plateau just outside of Narak, the one where her\nsoldiers often practiced.\nHer people had become something old, yet something new. Something\npowerful. They stood in lines on this plateau, humming to Fury. She divided\nthem by combat experience. A new form would not a soldier make; many of\nthese had been workers all their lives.\nThey would have a part to play. They would bring about something\ngrand.\n“The Alethi will come,” Venli said, strolling at Eshonai’s side and\nabsently bringing energy to her fingers and letting it play between two of\nthem. Venli smiled often while wearing this new form. Otherwise, it didn’t\nseem to have changed her at all.\nEshonai knew that she herself had changed. But Venli… Venli acted the\nsame.\nSomething felt wrong about that."

But Venli… Venli acted the\nsame.\nSomething felt wrong about that.\n“The agent who sent this report is certain of it,” Venli continued. “Your\nvisit to the Blackthorn seems to have encouraged them to action, and the\nhumans intend to strike toward Narak in force. Of course, this could still\nturn into a disaster.”\n“No,” Eshonai said. “No. It is perfect.”\nVenli looked to her, stopping on the rock field. “We need no more\ntraining. We should act, right now, to bring a highstorm.”\n“We will do it when the humans near,” Eshonai said.\n“Why? Let us do it tonight.”\n“Foolishness,” Eshonai said. “This is a tool to use in battle. If we\nproduce an unexpected storm now, the Alethi won’t come, and we won’t\nwin this war. We must wait.”\nVenli seemed thoughtful. Finally, she smiled, then nodded.\n“What do you know that you aren’t telling me?” Eshonai demanded,\ntaking her sister by the shoulder.\nVenli smiled more broadly. “I’m simply persuaded. We must wait. The\nstorm will blow the wrong way, after all. Or is it all other storms that have\nblown the wrong way, and this one will be the first to blow the right way?”\nThe wrong way? “How do you know? About the direction?”\n“The songs.”\nThe songs. But… they said nothing about…\nSomething deep within Eshonai nudged her to move on. “If that is true,”\nshe said, “we’ll have to wait until the humans are practically on top of us to\ncatch them in it.”\n“Then that is what we do,” Venli said. “I will set to the teaching. Our\nweapon will be ready.”\nShe spoke to the Rhythm of Craving, a rhythm like the old Rhythm of\nAnticipation, but more violent.\nVenli walked away, joined by her once-mate and many of her scholars.\nThey seemed comfortable in these forms. Too comfortable. They couldn’t\nhave held these forms before… could they?\nEshonai shoved down the screams and went to prepare another battalion\nof new soldiers. She had always hated being a general. How ironic, then,\nthat she would be recorded in their songs as the warleader who had finally\ncrushed the Alethi.\nI-14. Taravangian\nTaravangian, king of Kharbranth, awoke to stiff muscles and an ache in\nhis back. He didn’t feel stupid. That was a good sign.\nHe sat up with a groan. Those aches were perpetual now, and his best\nhealers could only shake their heads and promise him that he was fit for his\nage. Fit. His joints cracked like logs on the fire and he couldn’t stand\nquickly, lest he lose his balance and topple to the floor. To age truly was to\nsuffer the ultimate treason, that of one’s body against oneself.\nHe sat up in his cot. Water lapped quietly against the hull of his cabin,\nand the air smelled of salt. He heard shouts in the near distance, however.\nThe ship had arrived on schedule. Excellent."

        "text": "He sat up in his cot. Water lapped quietly against the hull of his cabin,\nand the air smelled of salt. He heard shouts in the near distance, however.\nThe ship had arrived on schedule. Excellent.\nAs he settled himself, one servant approached with a table and another\nwith a warm, wet cloth for wiping his eyes and hands. Behind them waited\nthe King’s Testers. How long had it been since Taravangian had been alone,\ntruly alone? Not since before the aches had come upon him.\nMaben knocked on the open door, bearing his morning meal on a tray,\nstewed and spiced grain mush. It was supposed to be good for his\nconstitution. Tasted like dishwater. Bland dishwater. Maben stepped\nforward to set out the meal, but Mrall—a Thaylen man in a black leather\ncuirass who wore both his head and eyebrows shaved—stopped her with a\nhand to the arm.\n“Tests first,” Mrall said.\nTaravangian looked up, meeting the large man’s gaze. Mrall could loom\nover a mountain and intimidate the wind itself. Everyone assumed he was\nTaravangian’s head bodyguard. The truth was more disturbing.\nMrall was the one who got to decide whether Taravangian would spend\nthe day as king or as a prisoner.\n“Surely you can let him eat first!” Maben said.\n“This is an important day,” Mrall said, voice low. “I would know the\nresult of the testing.”\n“But—”\n“It is his right to demand this, Maben,” Taravangian said. “Let us be on\nwith it.”\nMrall stepped back, and the testers approached, a group of three\nstormwardens in deliberately esoteric robes and caps. They presented a\nseries of pages covered in figures and glyphs. They were today’s variation\non a sequence of increasingly challenging mathematical problems devised\nby Taravangian himself on one of his better days.\nHe picked up his pen with hesitant fingers. He did not feel stupid, but he\nrarely did. Only on the worst of days did he immediately recognize the\ndifference. On those days, his mind was thick as tar, and he felt like a\nprisoner in his own mind, aware that something was profoundly wrong.\nToday wasn’t one of those, fortunately. He wasn’t a complete idiot. At\nworst, he’d just be very stupid.\nHe set to his task, solving what mathematical problems he could. It took\nthe better part of an hour, but during the process, he was able to gauge his\ncapacity. As he had suspected, he was not terribly smart—but he was not\nstupid, either. Today… he was average.\nThat would do.\nHe turned over the problems to the stormwardens, who consulted in low\nvoices. They turned to Mrall. “He is fit to serve,” one proclaimed. “He may\nnot offer binding commentary on the Diagram, but he may interact outside\nof supervision. He may change government policy so long as there is a\nthree-day delay before the changes take effect, and he may also freely pass\njudgment in trials.”\nMrall nodded, looking to Taravangian. “Do you accept this assessment\nand these restrictions, Your Majesty?”\n“I do.”\nMrall nodded, then stepped back, allowing Maben to set out\nTaravangian’s morning meal."

        "text": "and these restrictions, Your Majesty?”\n“I do.”\nMrall nodded, then stepped back, allowing Maben to set out\nTaravangian’s morning meal.\nThe trio of stormwardens tucked away the papers he’d filled out, then\nthey retreated to their own cabins. The testing was an extravagant\nprocedure, and consumed valuable time each morning. Still, it was the best\nway he had found to deal with his condition.\nLife could be tricky for a man who awoke each morning with a different\nlevel of intelligence. Particularly when the entire world might depend upon\nhis genius, or might come crashing down upon his idiocy.\n“How is it out there?” Taravangian asked softly, picking at his meal,\nwhich had gone cold during the testing.\n“Horrible,” Mrall said with a grin. “Just as we wanted it.”\n“Do not take pleasure in suffering,” Taravangian replied. “Even when it\nis a work of our hands.” He took a bite of the mush. “Particularly when it is\na work of our hands.”\n“As you wish. I will do so no more.”\n“Can you really change that easily?” Taravangian asked. “Turn off your\nemotions on a whim?”\n“Of course,” Mrall said.\nSomething about that tickled at Taravangian, some thread of interest. If\nhe had been in one of his more brilliant states, he might have seized upon it\n—but today, he sensed thought seeping away like water between fingers.\nOnce, he had fretted about these missed opportunities, but he had eventually\nmade his peace. Days of brilliance—he had come to learn—brought their\nown problems.\n“Let me see the Diagram,” he said. Anything to distract from this slop\nthey insisted on feeding him.\nMrall stepped aside, allowing Adrotagia—head of Taravangian’s\nscholars—to approach, bearing a thick, leatherbound volume. She set it\nonto the table before Taravangian, then bowed.\nTaravangian rested his fingers upon the leatherbound cover, feeling a\nmoment of… reverence? Was that right? Did he revere anything anymore?\nGod was dead, after all, and Vorinism therefore a sham.\nThis book, though, was holy. He opened it to one of the pages marked\nwith a reed. Inside were scribbles.\nFrenetic, bombastic, majestic scribbles that had been painstakingly\ncopied from the walls of his former bedroom. Sketches laid atop one\nanother, lists of numbers that seemed to make no sense, lines upon lines\nupon lines of script written in a cramped hand.\nMadness. And genius.\nHere and there, Taravangian could find hints that this writing was his\nown. The way he wiggled a line, the way he wrote along the edge of a wall,\nmuch like how he would write along the side of a page when he was\nrunning out of room. He didn’t remember any of this. It was the product of\ntwenty hours of lucid insanity, the most brilliant he had ever been.\n“Does it strike you as odd, Adro,” Taravangian asked the scholar, “that\ngenius and idiocy are so similar?”\n“Similar?” Adrotagia asked. “Vargo, I do not see them as similar at all.”"

        "text": "genius and idiocy are so similar?”\n“Similar?” Adrotagia asked. “Vargo, I do not see them as similar at all.”\nHe and Adrotagia had grown up together, and she still used Taravangian’s\nboyhood nickname. He liked that. It reminded him of days before all of this.\n“On both my most stupid days and my most incredible,” Taravangian\nsaid, “I am unable to interact with those around me in a meaningful way. It\nis like… like I become a gear that cannot fit those turning beside it. Too\nsmall or too large, it does not matter. The clock will not work.”\n“I had not considered that,” Adrotagia said.\nWhen Taravangian was at his stupidest, he was not allowed from his\nroom. Those were the days he spent drooling in a corner. When he was\nmerely dull-minded, he was allowed out under supervision. He spent those\nnights crying for what he had done, knowing that the atrocities he\ncommitted were important, but not understanding why.\nWhen he was dull, he could not change policy. Interestingly, he had\ndecided that when he was too brilliant, he was also not allowed to change\npolicy. He’d made this decision after a day of genius where he’d thought to\nfix all of Kharbranth’s problems with a series of very rational edicts—such\nas requiring people to take an intelligence test of his own devising before\nbeing allowed to breed.\nSo brilliant on one hand. So stupid on another. Is that your joke here,\nNightwatcher? he wondered. Is that the lesson I’m to learn? Do you even\ncare about lessons, or is what you do to us merely for your own\namusement?\nHe turned his attention back to the book, the Diagram. That grand plan\nhe had devised on his singular day of unparalleled brilliance. Then, too,\nhe’d spent the day staring at a wall. He’d written on it. Babbling the whole\ntime, making connections no man had ever before made, he had scribbled\nall over his walls, floor, even parts of the ceiling he could reach. Most of it\nhad been written in an alien script—a language he himself had devised, for\nthe scripts he had known had been unable to convey ideas precisely enough.\nFortunately, he’d thought to carve a key on the top of his bedside table,\notherwise they wouldn’t have been able to make sense of his masterpiece.\nThey could barely make sense of it anyway. He flipped through several\npages, copied exactly from his room. Adrotagia and her scholars had made\nnotations here and there, offering theories on what various drawings and\nlists might mean. They wrote those in the women’s script, which\nTaravangian had learned years ago.\nAdrotagia’s notes on one page indicated that a picture there appeared to\nbe a sketch of the mosaic on the floor of the Veden palace. He paused on\nthat page. It might have relevance to this day’s activities. Unfortunately, he\nwasn’t smart enough today to make much sense of the book or its secrets.\nHe had to trust that his smarter self was correct in his interpretations of his\neven smarter self’s genius.\nHe shut the book and put down his spoon. “Let us be on with it.” He\nstood up and left the cabin, Mrall on one side of him and Adrotagia on the"

He emerged into sunlight and to the sight of a smoldering coastal city,\ncomplete with enormous terraced formations—like plates, or sections of\nshalebark, the remnants of city covering them and practically spilling over\nthe sides. Once, this sight had been wondrous. Now, it was black, the\nbuildings—even the palace—destroyed.\nVedenar, one of the great cities of the world, was now little more than a\nheap of rubble and ash.\nTaravangian idled by the rail. When his ship had sailed into the harbor\nthe night before, the city had been dotted with the red glow of burning\nbuildings. Those had seemed alive. More alive than this. The wind was\nblowing in off the ocean, pushing at him from behind. It swept the smoke\ninland, away from the ship, so that Taravangian could barely smell it. An\nentire city burned just beyond his fingertips, and yet the stench vanished\ninto the wind.\nThe Weeping would come soon. Perhaps it would wash away some of\nthis destruction.\n“Come, Vargo,” Adrotagia said. “They are waiting.”\nHe nodded, joining her in climbing into the rowboat for tendering to\nshore. There had once been grand docks for this city. No more. One faction\nhad destroyed them in an attempt to keep out the others.\n“It’s amazing,” Mrall said, settling down into the tender beside him.\n“I thought you said you weren’t going to be pleased any longer,”\nTaravangian said, stomach turning as he saw one of the heaps at the edge of\nthe city. Bodies.\n“I am not pleased,” Mrall said, “but in awe. Do you realize that the\nEighty’s War between Emul and Tukar has lasted six years, and hasn’t\nproduced nearly this level of desolation? Jah Keved ate itself in a matter of\nmonths!”\n“Soulcasters,” Adrotagia whispered.\nIt was more than that. Even in his painfully normal state, Taravangian\ncould see it was so. Yes, with Soulcasters to provide food and water, armies\ncould march at speed—no carts or supply lines to slow them—and\ncommence a slaughter in almost no time at all. But Emul and Tukar had\ntheir share of Soulcasters as well.\nSailors started rowing them toward shore.\n“There was more,” Mrall said. “Each highprince sought to seize the\ncapital. That made them converge. It was almost like the wars of some\nNorthern savages, with a time and place appointed for the shaking of spears\nand chanting of threats. Only here, it depopulated a kingdom.”\n“Let us hope, Mrall, that you make an overstatement,” Taravangian said.\n“We will need this kingdom’s people.” He turned away, stifling a moment\nof emotion as he saw bodies upon the rocks of the shore, men who had died\nby being shoved over the side of a nearby cliff into the ocean. That ridge\nnormally sheltered the dock from highstorms. In war, it had been used to\nkill, one army pressing the other back off the drop."

In war, it had been used to\nkill, one army pressing the other back off the drop.\nAdrotagia saw his tears, and though she said nothing, she pursed her\nlips in disapproval. She did not like how emotional he became when he was\nlow of intellect. And yet, he knew for a fact that the old woman still burned\na glyphward each morning as a prayer for her deceased husband. A\nstrangely devout action for blasphemers such as they.\n“What is the day’s news from home?” Taravangian asked to draw\nattention from the tears he wiped away.\n“Dova reports that the number of Death Rattles we’re finding has\ndropped even further. She didn’t find a single one yesterday, and only two\nthe day before.”\n“Moelach moves, then,” Taravangian said. “It is certain now. The\ncreature must have been drawn by something westward.” What now? Did\nTaravangian suspend the murders? His heart yearned to—but if they could\ndiscover even one more glimmer about the future, one fact that could save\nhundreds of thousands, would it not be worth the lives of the few now?\n“Tell Dova to continue the work,” he said. He had not anticipated that\ntheir covenant would attract the loyalty of an ardent, of all things. The\nDiagram, and its members, knew no boundaries. Dova had discovered their\nwork on her own, and they’d needed to either induct her or assassinate her.\n“It will be done,” Adrotagia said.\nThe boatmen moved them up alongside some smoother rocks at the\nharbor’s edge, then hopped out into the water. The men were servants of\nhis, and were part of the Diagram. He trusted them, for he needed to trust\nsome people.\n“Have you researched that other matter I requested?” Taravangian\nasked.\n“It is a difficult matter to answer,” Adrotagia said. “The exact\nintelligence of a man is impossible to measure; even your tests only give us\nan approximation. The speed at which you answer questions and the way\nyou answer them… well, it lets us make a judgment, but it is a crude one.”\nThe boatmen hauled them up onto the stony beach with ropes. Wood\nscraped stone with an awful sound. At least it covered up the moans in the\nnear distance.\nAdrotagia took a sheet from her pocket and unfolded it. Upon it was a\ngraph, with dots plotted in a kind of hump shape, a small trail to the left\nrising to a mountain in the center, then falling off in a similar curve to the\nright.\n“I took your last five hundred days’ test results and assigned each one a\nnumber between zero and ten,” Adrotagia said. “A representation of how\nintelligent you were that day, though as I said, it is not exact.”\n“The hump near the middle?” Taravangian asked, pointing.\n“When you were average intelligence,” Adrotagia said. “You spend\nmost of your time near there, as you can see. Days of pure intelligence and\ndays of ultimate stupidity are both rare. I had to extrapolate from what we\nhad, but I think this graph is somewhat accurate.”"

I had to extrapolate from what we\nhad, but I think this graph is somewhat accurate.”\nTaravangian nodded, then allowed one of the boatmen to help him\ndebark. He had known that he spent more days average than he did\notherwise. What he had asked her to figure out, however, was when he\ncould expect another day like the one during which he’d created the\nDiagram. It had been years now since that day of transcendent mastery.\nShe climbed out of the boat and Mrall followed. She stepped up to him\nwith her sheet.\n“So this is where I was most intelligent,” Taravangian said, pointing at\nthe last point on the chart. It was far to the right, and very close to the\nbottom. A representation of high intelligence and a low frequency of\noccurrence. “This was that day, that day of perfection.”\n“No,” Adrotagia said.\n“What?”\n“That was the time you were the most intelligent during the last five\nhundred days,” Adrotagia explained. “This point represents the day you\nfinished the most complex problems you’d left for yourself, and the day you\ndevised new ones for use in future tests.”\n“I remember that day,” he said. “It was when I solved Fabrisan’s\nConundrum.”\n“Yes,” she said. “The world may thank you for that, someday, if it\nsurvives.”\n“I was smart on that day,” he said. Smart enough that Mrall had\ndeclared he needed to be locked in the palace, lest he reveal his nature.\nHe’d been convinced that if he could just explain his condition to the city,\nthey would all listen to reason and let him control their lives perfectly. He’d\ndrafted a law requiring that all people of less than average intellect be\nrequired to commit suicide for the good of the city. It had seemed\nreasonable. He had considered they might resist, but thought that the\nbrilliance of the argument would sway them.\nYes, he had been smart on that day. But not nearly as smart as the day of\nthe Diagram. He frowned, inspecting the paper.\n“This is why I can’t answer your question, Vargo,” Adrotagia said.\n“That graph, it’s what we call a logarithmic scale. Each step from that\ncenter point is not equal—they compound on one another the farther out\nyou get. How smart were you on the day of the Diagram? Ten times smarter\nthan your smartest otherwise?”\n“A hundred,” Taravangian said, looking at the graph. “Maybe more. Let\nme do the calculations…”\n“Aren’t you stupid today?”\n“Not stupid. Average. I can figure this much. Each step to the side is…”\n“A measureable change in intelligence,” she said. “You might say that\neach step sideways is a doubling of your intelligence, though that is hard to\nquantify. The steps upward are easier; they measure how frequently you\nhave days of the given intelligence. So if you start at the center of the peak,\nyou can see that for every five days you spend being average, you spend\none day being mildly stupid and one day mildly smart. For every five of\nthose, you spend one day moderately stupid and one day moderately genius.\nFor every five days like that…”"

He moved sideways off the graph until he reached the\npoint where he guessed the day of the Diagram might have been. Even that\nseemed conservative to him.\n“Almighty above…” he whispered. Thousands of days. Thousands upon\nthousands. “It should never have happened.”\n“Of course it should have,” she said.\n“But it’s so unlikely as to be impossible!”\n“It’s perfectly possible,” she said. “The likelihood of it having happened\nis one, as it already occurred.

But if you want to know\nthe likelihood of it happening again…”\nHe nodded.\n“If you were to live another two thousand years, Vargo,” she said,\n“you’d maybe have one single day like this among them. Maybe. Even\nodds, I’d say.”\nMrall snorted. “So it was luck.”\n“No, it was simple probability.”\n“Either way,” Taravangian said, folding the paper. “This was not the\nanswer I wanted.”\n“Since when has it mattered what we want?”\n“Never,” he said. “And it never will.” He tucked the sheet into his\npocket.\nThey picked their way up the rocks, passing corpses bloated from too\nlong in the sun, and joined a small group of soldiers at the top of the beach.\nThey wore the burnt-orange crest of Kharbranth. He had few soldiers to his\nname. The Diagram called for his nation to be unthreatening.\nThe Diagram was not perfect, however. They caught errors in it now\nand then. Or… not truly errors, just missed guesses. Taravangian had been\nsupremely brilliant that day, but he had not been able to see the future. He\nhad made educated guesses—very educated—and had been right an eerie\namount of the time. But the farther they went from that day and the\nknowledge he’d had then, the more the Diagram needed tending and\ncultivation to stay on course.\nThat was why he’d hoped for another such day soon, a day to revamp\nthe Diagram. That would not come, most likely. They would have to\ncontinue, trusting in that man that he had once been, trusting his vision and\nunderstanding.\nBetter that than anything else in this world. Gods and religion had failed\nthem. Kings and highlords were selfish, petty things. If he was going to\ntrust one thing to believe in, it would be himself and the raw genius of a\nhuman mind unfettered.\nIt was difficult at times, though, to stay the course. Particularly when he\nfaced the consequences of his actions.\nThey entered the battlefield.\nMost of the fighting had apparently moved outside of the city, once the\nfire began.

Would that matter?\nA soldier handed him a scented handkerchief to hold over his face as\nthey passed the dead and dying. Blood and smoke. Scents he would come to\nknow all too well before this was through.\nMen and women in the burnt-orange livery of Kharbranth picked\nthrough the dead and wounded. Throughout the East, the color had become\nsynonymous with healing. Indeed, tents flying his banner—the banner of\nthe surgeon—dotted the battlefield. Taravangian’s healers had arrived just\nbefore the battle, and had started ministering to the wounded immediately.\nAs he left the fields of the dead, Veden soldiers began to stand up from\nwhere they sat in a dull-eyed stupor at the edges of the battlefield. Then\nthey started to cheer him.\n“Pali’s mind,” Adrotagia said, watching them rise. “I don’t believe it.”\nThe soldiers sat separated in groups by banner, being tended to by\nTaravangian’s surgeons, water-bearers, and comforters. Wounded and\nunwounded alike, any who could stand rose for the king of Kharbranth and\ncheered him.\n“The Diagram said it would happen,” Taravangian said.\n“I thought for certain that was an error,” she replied, shaking her head.\n“They know,” Mrall said. “We are the only victors this day. Our healers,\nwho earned the respect of all sides. Our comforters who helped the dying\npass. Their highlords brought them only misery. You brought them life and\nhope.”\n“I brought them death,” Taravangian whispered.\nHe had ordered the execution of their king, along with specific\nhighprinces the Diagram indicated. In doing so, he had pushed the various\nfactions into war with one another. He had brought this kingdom to its\nknees.\nNow they cheered him for it. He forced himself to stop with one of the\ngroups, asking after their health, seeing if there was anything he could do\nfor them. It was important to be seen by the people as a compassionate man.\nThe Diagram explained this in casual sterility, as if compassion were\nsomething one could measure in a cup next to a pint of blood.\nHe visited another group of soldiers, then a third. Many stepped up to\nhim, touching his arms or his robe, weeping tears of thanks and joy. Many\nmore of the Veden soldiers remained sitting in the tents, however, staring\nout over the fields of dead. Numb of mind.\n“The Thrill?” he whispered to Adrotagia as they left the latest group of\nmen. “They fought through the night as their capital burned. It must have\nbeen in force.”\n“I agree,” she said. “It gives us a further reference point. The Thrill is at\nleast as strong here as it is in Alethkar. Maybe stronger. I will speak to our\nscholars. Perhaps this will help pinpoint Nergaoul.”\n“Do not spend too much effort on that,” Taravangian said, approaching\nanother group of Veden soldiers. “I’m not sure what we would even do if\nwe found the thing.” An ancient, evil spren was not something he had the\nresources to tackle. Not yet at least. “I would rather know where Moelach is\nmoving.”"

Not yet at least. “I would rather know where Moelach is\nmoving.”\nHopefully, Moelach hadn’t decided to slumber again. The Death Rattles\nhad, so far, offered them the best way that they’d found to augment the\nDiagram.\nThere was one answer, however, he’d never been able to determine. One\nhe’d give almost anything to know.\nWould all of this be enough?\nHe met with the soldiers, and adopted the air of a kindly—if not bright\n—old man. Caring and helpful. He was almost that man in truth, today. He\ntried to do an imitation of himself when he was a little dumber. People\naccepted that man, and when he was of that intellect, he did not need to\nfeign compassion nearly as much as he did when smarter.\nBlessed with intelligence, cursed with compassion to feel pain for what\nhe had done. They came inversely. Why couldn’t he have both at once? He\ndid not think that in other people, intelligence and compassion were tied in\nsuch a way. The Nightwatcher’s motives behind her boons and curses were\nunfathomable.\nTaravangian moved through the crowd of men, listening to them beg for\nmore relief and for drugs to ease their pain. Listening to their thanks. These\nsoldiers had suffered a fight that—even yet—seemed to have no victor.\nThey wanted something to hold to, and Taravangian was neutral,\nsupposedly. It was shocking how easily they bared their souls to him.\nHe came to the next soldier in line, a cloaked man clutching an\napparently broken arm. Taravangian looked into the man’s hooded eyes.\nIt was Szeth-son-son-Vallano.\nTaravangian felt a moment of sheer panic.\n“We need to speak,” the Shin man said.\nTaravangian grabbed the assassin by the arm, hauling him away from\nthe crowd of Veden soldiers. With his other hand, Taravangian felt in his\npocket for the Oathstone he carried on his person at all times. He pulled it\nout just to see. Yes, it was no fake. Damnation, seeing Szeth there had made\nhim think that he’d been bested somehow, the stone stolen and Szeth sent to\nkill him.\nSzeth let himself be pulled away. What had he said? That he needed to\ntalk, you fool, Taravangian thought to himself. If he’d come to kill you, you\nwould be dead.\nHad Szeth been seen here? What would people say if they saw\nTaravangian interacting with a bald Shin man? Rumors had started from\nless. If anyone got even a hint that Taravangian had been involved with the\ninfamous Assassin in White…\nMrall noticed immediately that something was wrong. He barked orders\nto the guards, separating Taravangian from the Veden soldiers. Adrotagia—\nwho had been sitting with crossed arms nearby, watching and tapping her\nfoot—leaped to stride over. She peeked at the person under the hood, then\ngasped, the color draining from her face.\n“How dare you come here?” Taravangian said to Szeth, speaking under"

She peeked at the person under the hood, then\ngasped, the color draining from her face.\n“How dare you come here?” Taravangian said to Szeth, speaking under\nhis breath while maintaining a cheerful pose and expression. He was of only\naverage intelligence today, but he was still a king, raised and trained to the\ncourt. He could maintain his composure.\n“A problem has arisen,” Szeth said, face hooded, voice emotionless.\nSpeaking to this creature was like speaking to one of the dead themselves.\n“Why have you failed to kill Dalinar Kholin?” Adrotagia demanded\nwith quiet urgency. “We know you fled. Return and do the job!”\nSzeth glanced at her, but did not reply. She did not hold his Oathstone.\nHe did seem to note her, however, with those too-blank eyes of his.\nDamnation. Their plan had been to keep Szeth from meeting or knowing\nof Adrotagia, just in case he decided to turn against Taravangian and kill\nhim. The Diagram hypothesized this possibility.\n“Kholin has a Surgebinder,” Szeth said.\nSo, Szeth knew about Jasnah. Had she faked her death, then, as he’d\nsuspected? Damnation.\nThe battlefield seemed to grow still. To Taravangian, the moans of the\nwounded faded away. Everything narrowed to just him and Szeth. Those\neyes. The tone of the man’s voice. A dangerous tone. What—\nHe spoke with emotion, Taravangian realized. That last sentence was\nsaid with passion. It had sounded like a plea. As if Szeth’s voice were being\nsqueezed on the sides.\nThis man was not sane. Szeth-son-son-Vallano was the most dangerous\nweapon on all of Roshar, and he was broken.\nStorms, why couldn’t this have happened on a day when Taravangian\nhad more than half a wit?\n“What makes you say this?” Taravangian said, trying to buy time for his\nmind to lumber through the implications. He held Szeth’s Oathstone before\nhim, almost as if it could chase away problems like a superstitious woman’s\nglyphward.\n“I fought him,” Szeth said. “He protected Kholin.”\n“Ah, yes,” Taravangian said, thinking furiously. Szeth had been\nbanished from Shinovar, made Truthless for something relating to a claim\nthat the Voidbringers had returned. If he discovered that he wasn’t wrong\nabout that claim, then what—\nHim?\n“You fought a Surgebinder?” Adrotagia said, glancing at Taravangian.\n“Yes,” Szeth said. “An Alethi man who fed upon Stormlight. He healed\na Blade-severed arm. He is… Radiant…” That strain in his voice did not\nsound safe. Taravangian glanced at Szeth’s hands. They were clenching into\nfists time and time again, like hearts beating.\n“No, no,” Taravangian said. “I have learned this only recently. Yes, it\nmakes sense now.

One of the Honorblades has vanished.”\nSzeth blinked, and he focused on Taravangian, as if returning from a\ndistant place. “One of the other seven?”\n“Yes,” Taravangian said. “I have heard only hints. Your people are\nsecretive. But yes… I see, it is one of the two that allow Regrowth. Kholin\nmust have it.”\nSzeth swayed back and forth, though he did not seem conscious of the\nmotion. Even now, he moved with a fighter’s grace. Storms.\n“This man I fought,” Szeth said, “he summoned no Blade.”\n“But he used Stormlight,” Taravangian said.\n“Yes.”\n“So he must have an Honorblade.”\n“I…”\n“It is the only explanation.”\n“It…” Szeth’s voice grew colder. “Yes, the only explanation. I will kill\nhim and retrieve it.”\n“No,” Taravangian said firmly. “You are to return to Dalinar Kholin and\ndo the task assigned you. Do not fight this other man. Attack when he is not\npresent.”\n“But—”\n“Have I your Oathstone?” Taravangian demanded. “Is my word to be\nquestioned?”\nSzeth stopped swaying. His gaze locked with Taravangian’s. “I am\nTruthless. I do as my master requires, and I do not ask for an explanation.”\n“Stay away from the man with the Honorblade,” Taravangian repeated.\n“Kill Dalinar.”\n“It will be done.” Szeth turned and strode away. Taravangian wanted to\nyell further instructions. Don’t be seen! Don’t ever come to me in public\nagain!\nInstead, he sat right there on the path, composure crumbling. He gasped,\ntrembling, sweat streaming down his brow.\n“Stormfather,” Adrotagia said, settling on the ground beside him. “I\nthought we were dead.”\nServants brought Taravangian a chair while Mrall made excuses for\nhim. The king is overcome with grief at the deaths of so many. He is old,\nyou know. And so caring…\nTaravangian breathed in and out, struggling to regain control. He looked\nto Adrotagia, who sat in the middle of a circle of servants and soldiers, all\nsworn to the Diagram. “Who is it?” he asked softly. “Who is this\nSurgebinder?”\n“Jasnah’s ward?” Adrotagia said.\nThey had been startled when that one arrived on the Shattered Plains.\nAlready they hypothesized that the girl had been trained. If not by Jasnah,\nthen by the girl’s brother, before his death.\n“No,” Taravangian said. “A male. One of Dalinar’s family members?”\nHe thought for a time. “We need the Diagram itself.”\nShe went to fetch it from the ship. Nothing else—his visits to the\nsoldiers, more important meetings with Veden leaders—mattered right now.\nThe Diagram was off. They strayed into dangerous territory.\nShe returned with it, and with the stormwardens, who set up a tent\naround Taravangian right there on the path. Excuses continued.

Taravangian cares while your own\nlighteyes sent you to the slaughter…\nBy the light of spheres, Taravangian picked through the tome, poring\nover translations of his own words written in a language he had invented\nand then forgotten. Answers. He needed answers.\n“Did ever I tell you, Adro, what I asked for?” he whispered as he read.\n“Yes.”\nHe was barely listening. “Capacity,” he whispered, turning a page.\n“Capacity to stop what was coming. The capacity to save humankind.”\nHe searched. He was not brilliant today, but he had spent many days\nreading these pages, going over, and over, and over passages. He knew\nthem.\nThe answers would be here. They would. Taravangian worshipped only\none god now. It was the man he had been on that day.\nThere.\nHe found it on a reproduction of one corner of his room, where he’d\nwritten in tiny script sentences over the top of one another because he’d run\nout of space. In his clarity of genius, the sentences had looked easy to\nseparate, but it had taken his scholars years to piece together what this said.\nThey will come. You cannot stop their oaths. Look for those who survive\nwhen they should not. That pattern will be your clue.\n“The bridgemen,” Taravangian whispered.\n“What?” Adrotagia asked.\nTaravangian looked up, blinking bleary eyes. “Dalinar’s bridgemen, the\nones he took from Sadeas. Did you read the account of their survival?”\n“I didn’t think it important. Just another game of power between Sadeas\nand Dalinar.”\n“No. It’s more.” They had survived. Taravangian stood up. “Wake every\nAlethi sleeper we have; send every agent in the area. There will be stories\ntold of one of these bridgemen. Miraculous survival. Favored of the winds.\nOne is among them. He might not know yet exactly what he’s doing, but he\nhas bonded a spren and sworn at least the First Ideal.”\n“If we find him?” Adrotagia asked.\n“We keep him away from Szeth at all costs.” Taravangian handed her\nthe Diagram. “Our lives depend upon it. Szeth is a beast who gnaws at his\nleg to escape his bonds. If he gets free…”\nShe nodded, moving off to do as he commanded. She hesitated at the\nflaps to their temporary tent. “We might have to reassess our methods of\ndetermining your intelligence. What I have seen in the last hour makes me\nquestion whether ‘average’ can be applied to you today.”\n“The assessments are not inaccurate,” he said. “You simply\nunderestimate the average man.”\nBesides, in dealing with the Diagram, he might not remember what he\nhad written or why—but there were echoes sometimes.\nShe left, making way as Mrall stepped in. “Your Majesty,” he said.\n“Time runs short.

The highprince is dying.”\n“He’s been dying for years.” Still, Taravangian did hasten his step—as\nmuch as he was capable of doing these days—as he resumed his hike. He\ndidn’t stop with any more of the soldiers, and gave only brief waves toward\nthe cheers he received.\nEventually, Mrall led him over a hillside away from the immediate\nstench of the battle and the smoldering city. A series of stormwagons here\nflew an optimistic flag, that of the king of Jah Keved. The guards there let\nTaravangian enter their ring of wagons, and he approached the largest one,\nan enormous vehicle almost like a mobile building on wheels.\nThey found Highprince Valam… King Valam… in bed coughing. His\nhair had fallen out since Taravangian had last seen him, and his cheeks were\nso sunken that rainwater would have pooled in them. Redin, the king’s\nbastard son, stood at the foot of the bed, head bowed. With the three guards\nwho stood in the room, there wasn’t room for Taravangian, so he stopped in\nthe doorway.\n“Taravangian,” Valam said, then coughed into his handkerchief. The\ncloth came back bloodied. “You’ve come for my kingdom, have you?”\n“I don’t know what you mean, Your Majesty,” Taravangian said.\n“Don’t play coy,” Valam snapped. “I can’t stand it in women or in\nrivals. Stormfather… I don’t know what they’re going to make of you. I\nhalf think they’ll have you assassinated by the end of the week.” He waved\nwith a sickly hand, all draped in cloth, and the guards made way for\nTaravangian to enter the small bedchamber.\n“Clever ploy,” the king said. “Sending that food, those healers. The\nsoldiers love you, I’ve heard. What would you have done if one side had\nwon decisively?”\n“I’d have had a new ally,” Taravangian said. “Grateful for my aid.”\n“You helped all sides.”\n“But the winner the most, Your Majesty,” Taravangian said. “We can\nminister to survivors, but not the dead.”\nValam coughed again, a great hacking mess. His bastard stepped up,\nconcerned, but the king waved him back. “Would have figured,” the king\nsaid to him between wheezes, “you’d be the only one of my children to live,\nbastard.” He turned to Taravangian. “Turns out, you have a legitimate claim\non the throne, Taravangian. Through your mother’s side, I think? A\nmarriage to a Veden princess some three generations back?”\n“I am not aware,” Taravangian said.\n“Didn’t you hear me about being coy?”\n“We both have a role to play in this production, Your Majesty,”\nTaravangian said. “I am merely speaking the lines as they were written.”\n“You talk like a woman,” Valam said. He spat blood to the side. “I know\nwhat you’re up to. In a week or so, after caring for my people, your scribes\nwill ‘discover’ your claim on the throne. You’ll reluctantly step in to save"

You’ll reluctantly step in to save\nthe kingdom, as urged by my own storming people.”\n“I see you’ve had the script read to you,” Taravangian said softly.\n“That assassin will come for you.”\n“He very well might.” That was the truth.\n“Don’t know why I even storming tried for this throne,” Valam said. “At\nleast I’ll die as king.” He heaved a deep breath, then raised his hand,\ngesturing impatiently at the scribes huddled outside the room. The women\nperked up, peeking around Taravangian.\n“I’m making this idiot my heir,” Valam said, waving at Taravangian.\n“Ha! Let the other highprinces chew on that.”\n“They’re dead, Your Majesty,” Taravangian said.\n“What? All of them?”\n“Yes.”\n“Even Boriar?”\n“Yes.”\n“Huh,” Valam said. “Bastard.”\nAt first, Taravangian thought that was a reference to one of the\ndeceased. Then, however, he noticed the king waving at his illegitimate son.\nRedin stepped up, going onto one knee beside the bed as Taravangian made\nroom.\nValam struggled with something beneath his blankets; his side knife.\nRedin helped him get it out, then held the knife awkwardly.\nTaravangian inspected this Redin, curious. This was the king’s ruthless\nexecutioner that he had read about? This concerned, helpless-looking man?\n“Through my heart,” Valam said.\n“Father, no…” Redin said.\n“Through my storming heart!” Valam shouted, spraying bloody spittle\nacross his sheet. “I won’t lie here and let Taravangian coax my own\nservants into poisoning me. Do it, boy! Or can’t you do a single thing that\n—”\nRedin slammed the knife down into his father’s chest with such force, it\nmade Taravangian jump. Redin then stood, saluted, and shoved his way out\nof the room.\nThe king heaved a final gasp, eyes glazing over. “So the night will\nreign, for the choice of honor is life…”\nTaravangian raised an eyebrow. A Death Rattle? Here, now? Blast, and\nhe wasn’t in a position where he could write down the exact phrasing. He’d\nhave to remember it.\nValam’s life faded away until he was simply meat. A Shardblade\nappeared from vapor beside the bed, then thumped to the wooden floor of\nthe wagon. Nobody reached for it, and the soldiers in the room and scribes\noutside it looked to Taravangian, then knelt.\n“Cruel, what Valam did to that one,” Mrall said, nodding toward the\nbastard, who shoved his way out of the stormwagon and into the light.\n“More than you know,” Taravangian said, reaching out to touch the\nknife protruding through blanket and clothing from the old king’s chest.

I would speak a prayer for him.”\nThe others left him, even Mrall. They shut the small door, and\nTaravangian sat down on the stool beside the corpse. He had no intention of\nsaying any sort of prayer, but he did want a moment. Alone. To think.\nIt had worked. Just as the Diagram instructed, Taravangian was king of\nJah Keved. He had taken the first major step toward unifying the world, as\nGavilar had insisted would need to happen if they were to survive.\nThat was, at least, what the visions had proclaimed. Visions Gavilar had\nconfided in him six years ago, the night of the Alethi king’s death. Gavilar\nhad seen visions of the Almighty, who was also now dead, and of a coming\nstorm.\nUnite them.\n“I am doing my best, Gavilar,” Taravangian whispered. “I am sorry that\nI need to kill your brother.”\nThat would not be the only sin upon his head when this was done. Not\nby a faint breeze or a stormwind.\nHe wished, once again, that this day had been a day of brilliance. Then\nhe wouldn’t have felt so guilty.\nPart Five: Winds Alight\n76.

He lay in his dark barrack room, surrounded\nby familiar stone, comfortable for the first time in days. A soft pillow, a\nmattress as good as the one he’d had back home in Hearthstone.\nHis body felt wrung out, like a rag after the washing was done. He’d\nsurvived the chasms and brought Shallan home safely. Now he needed to\nsleep and heal.\nYou have killed her…\nHe sat up in his bed, and felt a wave of dizziness. He gritted his teeth\nand let it pass. His leg wound throbbed inside his bandage. The camp\nsurgeons had done a good job with that; his father would have been pleased.\nThe camp outside felt too quiet. After showering him with praise and\nenthusiasm, the men of Bridge Four had gone to join the army for its\nexpedition, along with all of the other bridge crews, who would be carrying\nbridges for the army. Only a small force from Bridge Four would remain\nbehind to guard the king.\nKaladin reached out in the darkness, feeling beside the wall until he\nfound his spear.

If a tailor tries to charge you full price for\na hat that small, you thump him real good.”\n“That’s the most ridiculous piece of advice I’ve ever been given.”\n“You should rub yourself with curry and go prancing through the camp\nsinging Horneater lullabies.”\nKaladin looked at Lopen, incredulous. “What?”\n“See? Now the bit about the hat is only the second most ridiculous piece\nof advice you’ve ever been given, so you should try it. Women like hats. I\nhave this cousin who makes them. I can ask her. You might not even need\nthe actual hat. Just the spren of the hat. That’ll make it even cheaper.”\n“You’re a very special kind of weird, Lopen.”\n“Of course I am, gon. There’s only one of me.”\nThey continued through the empty camp. Storms, the place seemed\nhollow. They passed empty barrack after empty barrack. Kaladin walked\nwith care, glad for Lopen’s help, but even this was draining. He shouldn’t\nbe moving on the leg. Father’s words, the words of a surgeon, floated up\nfrom the depths of his mind.\nTorn muscles. Bind the leg, ward against infection, and keep the subject\nfrom putting weight on it. Further tearing could lead to a permanent limp,\nor worse.\n“You want to get a palanquin?” Lopen asked.\n“Those are for women.”\n“Ain’t nothing wrong with being a woman, gancho,” Lopen said. “Some\nof my relatives are women.”"

Storming Herdazian.\nHow much of what he said was to deliberately sound obtuse? Well, Kaladin\nhad heard men telling jokes about how stupid Herdazians were, but Lopen\ncould talk rings around those men. Of course, half of Lopen’s own jokes\nwere about Herdazians. He seemed to find those extra funny.\nAs they approached the plateaus, the dead silence gave way to the low\nroar of thousands of people assembled in a limited area. Kaladin and Lopen\nfinally broke free of the barrack rows, emerging onto the natural terrace just\nabove the parade grounds that debouched onto the Shattered Plains.\nThousands of soldiers were gathered there. Spearmen in huge blocks,\nlighteyed archers in thinner ranks, officers prancing on horseback in\ngleaming armor.\nKaladin gasped softly.\n“What?” Lopen asked.\n“It’s what I always thought I’d find.”\n“What? Today?”\n“As a young man in Alethkar,” Kaladin said, unexpectedly emotional.\n“When I dreamed of the glory of war, this is what I imagined.” He hadn’t\npictured the greenvines and barely capable soldiers that Amaram had\ntrained in Alethkar. Neither had he pictured the crude, if effective, brutes of\nSadeas’s army—or even the quick strike teams of Dalinar’s plateau runs.\nHe’d imagined this. A full army, arrayed for a grand march. Spears held\nhigh, banners fluttering, drummers and trumpeters, messengers in livery,\nscribes on horses, even the king’s Soulcasters in their own sectioned-off\nsquare, hidden from sight by walls of cloth carried on poles.\nKaladin knew the truth of battle now. Fighting was not about glory, but\nabout men lying on the ground screaming and thrashing, tangled in their\nown viscera. It was about bridgemen thrown against a wall of arrows, or of\nParshendi cut down while they sang.\nYet in this moment, Kaladin let himself dream again. He gave his\nyouthful self—still there deep inside him—the spectacle he’d always\nimagined. He pretended that these soldiers were about something\nwonderful, instead of just another pointless slaughter.\n“Hey, someone else is actually coming,” Lopen said, pointing. “Look at\nthat.”\nBy the banners, Dalinar had been joined by only a single highprince:\nRoion. However, as Lopen pointed out, another force—not quite as large or\nas well organized—was flowing northward up the wide, open pathway\nalong the eastern rim of the warcamps. At least one other highprince had\nresponded to Dalinar’s call.\n“Let’s find Bridge Four,” Kaladin said. “I want to see the men off.”\n* * *\n“Sebarial?” Dalinar asked. “Sebarial’s troops are joining us?”\nRoion grunted, wringing his hands—as if wishing to wash them—as he\nsat in the saddle. “I guess we should be glad for any support at all.”"

Why would he\nsend men now?”\nRoion shook his head and shrugged.\nDalinar turned Gallant and trotted the horse toward the oncoming group,\nas did Roion. They passed Adolin, who rode just behind with Shallan, side\nby side, her guards and his following. Renarin was over with the\nbridgemen, of course.\nShallan was riding one of Adolin’s own horses, a petite gelding over\nwhich Sureblood towered. Shallan wore a traveling dress of the kind\nmessenger women preferred, with the front and back slit all the way to the\nwaist. She wore leggings—basically silk trousers, but women preferred\nother names—underneath.\nBehind them rode a large group of Navani’s scholars and cartographers,\nincluding Isasik, the ardent who was the royal cartographer. These passed\naround the map Shallan had drawn, Isasik riding to the side, chin raised, as\nif pointedly ignoring the praise the women were giving Shallan’s map.\nDalinar needed all these scholars, though he wished he didn’t. Each scribe\nhe brought was another life he risked. That was made worse by Navani\nherself coming. He couldn’t dismiss her argument. If you think it’s safe\nenough for you to bring the girl, then it’s safe enough for me.\nAs Dalinar made his way toward Sebarial’s oncoming procession,\nAmaram rode up, wearing his Shardplate, his golden cloak trailing behind.\nHe had a fine warhorse, the hulking breed used in Shinovar to pull heavy\ncarts. It still looked like a pony beside Gallant.\n“Is that Sebarial?” Amaram asked, pointing at the oncoming force.\n“Apparently.”\n“Should we send him away?”\n“Why would we do that?”\n“He’s untrustworthy,” Amaram said.\n“He keeps his word, so far as I know,” Dalinar said. “That is more than\nI can say for most.”\n“He keeps his word because he never promises anything.”\nDalinar, Roion, and Amaram trotted up to Sebarial, who stepped out of\na carriage at the front of the army. A carriage. For a war procession. Well, it\nwouldn’t slow Dalinar any more than all of these scribes. In fact, he should\nprobably have a few more carriages made ready. It would be nice for\nNavani to have a way to ride in comfort once the days wore long.\n“Sebarial?” Dalinar asked.\n“Dalinar!” the plump man said, shading his eyes. “You look surprised.”\n“I am.”\n“Ha! That’s reason enough to have come. Wouldn’t you say, Palona?”\nDalinar could barely make out the woman sitting in the carriage,\nwearing an enormous fashionable hat and a sleek gown.\n“You brought your mistress?” Dalinar asked.\n“Sure. Why not? If we fail out there, I’ll be dead and she’ll be out on"

Something’s going to happen out there on the\nPlains, and opportunity rises like the dawn.”\nRoion sniffed.\n“Roion,” Sebarial said, “shouldn’t you be hiding under a table\nsomewhere?”\n“Perhaps I should, if only to get away from you.”\nSebarial laughed. “Well said, you old turtle! Maybe this trip won’t be a\ncomplete bore. Onward, then! To glory and some such nonsense. If we find\nriches, remember that I get my part! I got here before Aladar. That has to\ncount for something.”\n“Before…” Dalinar said with a start. He twisted around, looking back\ntoward the warcamp bordering his own to the north.\nThere, an army wearing Aladar’s colors of white and dark green spilled\nout onto the Shattered Plains.\n“Now that,” Amaram said, “I really didn’t expect.”\n* * *\n“We could try a coup,” Ialai said.\nSadeas turned in his saddle toward his wife. Their guards scattered the\nhills around them, distant enough to be out of earshot as the highprince and\nhis wife enjoyed a gentle “ride through the hills.” In reality, the two of them\nhad wanted a closer look at Sebarial’s expansions out here west of the\nwarcamps, where he was setting up full-scale farming operations.\nIalai rode with eyes forward. “Dalinar will be gone from the camp, and\nwith him Roion, his only supporter. We could seize the Pinnacle, execute\nthe king, and take the throne.”\nSadeas turned his horse, looking eastward over the warcamps. He could\njust barely make out Dalinar’s army gathering distantly on the Shattered\nPlains.\nA coup. One last step, a slap in the face of old Gavilar. He’d do it.\nStorm it, he would.\nExcept for the fact that he didn’t need to.\n“Dalinar has committed to this foolish expedition,” Sadeas said. “He’ll\nbe dead soon, surrounded and destroyed on those Plains. We don’t need a\ncoup; if I’d known that he would actually do this, we wouldn’t have even\nneeded your assassin.”\nIalai looked away. Her assassin had failed. She considered it a strong\nfault on her part, though the plan had been executed with exactness. These\nthings were never certain. Unfortunately, now that they’d tried and failed,\nthey’d need to be careful about…\nSadeas turned his horse, frowning as a messenger approached on\nhorseback. The youth was allowed to pass the guards and proffered a letter\nto Ialai.\nShe read it, and her disposition darkened.\n“You aren’t going to like this,” she said, looking up.\n* * *\nDalinar kicked Gallant into motion, tearing across the landscape,\nstartling plants into their dens.

        "text": "* * *\nDalinar kicked Gallant into motion, tearing across the landscape,\nstartling plants into their dens. He passed his army in a few minutes of hard\nriding and approached the new force.\nAladar sat on horseback here, surveying his army. He wore a\nfashionable uniform, black with maroon stripes on the sleeves and a\nmatching stock at the neck. Soldiers swarmed around him. He had one of\nthe largest forces on the Plains—storms, with Dalinar’s numbers reduced,\nAladar’s army might be the largest.\nHe was also one of Sadeas’s greatest supporters.\n“How are we going to do this, Dalinar?” Aladar asked as Dalinar trotted\nup. “Do we all go out on our own, crossing different plateaus but meeting\nback up, or do we march in an enormous column?”\n“Why?” Dalinar asked. “Why have you come?”\n“You made such passionate arguments all along, and now you act\nsurprised that someone listened?”\n“Not someone. You.”\nAladar pressed his lips to a line, finally turning to meet Dalinar’s eyes.\n“Roion and Sebarial, the two biggest cowards in our midst, are marching to\nwar. Am I to stay behind and let them seek the fulfillment of the Vengeance\nPact without me?”\n“The other highprinces seem content to do so.”\n“I suspect they are better at lying to themselves than I am.”\nSuddenly, all of Aladar’s vehement arguments—at the forefront of the\nfaction against Dalinar—took on a different cast. He was arguing to\nconvince himself, Dalinar thought. He was worried all along that I was\nright.\n“Sadeas will not be pleased,” Dalinar said.\n“Sadeas can storm off. He doesn’t own me.” Aladar fiddled with his\nreins for a moment. “He wants to, though. I can feel it in the deals he forces\nme to make, the knives he slowly places at everyone’s throats. He’d have us\nall as his slaves by the end of this.”\n“Aladar,” Dalinar said, moving his horse right up alongside the other\nman’s so the two of them faced each other directly. He held Aladar’s eyes.\n“Tell me Sadeas didn’t put you up to this. Tell me this isn’t part of another\nplot to abandon or betray me.”\nAladar smiled. “You think I’d just tell you if it were?”\n“I would hear a promise from your own lips.”\n“And you’ll trust that promise? How well did that serve you, Dalinar,\nwhen Sadeas professed his friendship?”\n“A promise, Aladar.”\nAladar met his eyes. “I think the things you say about Alethkar are\nnaive at best, and undoubtedly impossible. Those delusions of yours aren’t\na sign of madness, as Sadeas wants us to think—they’re just the dreams of a\nman who wants desperately to believe in something, something foolish.\n‘Honor’ is a word applied to the actions of men from the past who have had\ntheir lives scrubbed clean by historians.” He hesitated. “But… storm me for\na fool, Dalinar, I wish they could be true. I came for myself, not Sadeas. I\nwon’t betray you. Even if Alethkar can’t ever be what you want, we can at"

Even if Alethkar can’t ever be what you want, we can at\nleast crush the Parshendi and avenge old Gavilar. It’s just the right thing to\ndo.”\nDalinar nodded.\n“I could be lying,” Aladar said.\n“But you aren’t.”\n“How do you know?”\n“Honestly? I don’t. But if this is all going to work, I am going to have to\ntrust some of you.” To an extent. He would never put himself in another\nposition like the Tower.\nEither way, Aladar’s presence meant this incursion was actually\npossible. Together, the four of them would likely outnumber the Parshendi\n—though he wasn’t certain how trustworthy the scribes’ counts of their\nnumbers were.\nIt was not the grand coalition of all highprinces that Dalinar had wanted,\nbut even with the chasms favoring the Parshendi, this could be enough.\n“We march together,” Dalinar said, pointing. “I don’t want us spread\nout. We keep to plateaus next to one another, or the same plateau when\npossible. And you’ll need to leave your parshmen behind.”\n“That’s an unusual requirement,” Aladar said with a frown.\n“We’re marching against their cousins,” Dalinar said. “Best to not risk\nthe possibility of them turning against us.”\n“But they’d never… Bah, whatever. It can be done.”\nDalinar nodded, extending a hand to Aladar as, behind, Roion and\nAmaram finally trotted up; Dalinar had outstripped them on Gallant.\n“Thank you,” Dalinar said to Aladar.\n“You really do believe in all of this, don’t you?”\n“Yes.”\nAladar extended his hand, but hesitated. “You realize that I’m stained\nthrough and through. I’ve got blood on these hands, Dalinar. I’m not some\nperfect, honorable knight as you seem to want to pretend.”\n“I know you’re not,” Dalinar said, taking the hand. “I’m not either. We\nwill have to do.”\nThey shared a nod, then Dalinar turned Gallant and began to trot back\ntoward his own army. Roion groaned, complaining about his thighs after\nhaving galloped all the way over. The ride today was not going to be\npleasant for him.\nAmaram fell in beside Dalinar. “First Sebarial, then Aladar? Your trust\nseems to come cheaply today, Dalinar.”\n“Would you have me turn them away?”\n“Think how spectacular this victory would be if we did it on our own.”\n“I hope we’re above such vainglory, old friend,” Dalinar said. They rode\nfor a time, passing Adolin and Shallan again. Dalinar scanned his force and\nnoticed something. A tall man in blue sat on a stone in the midst of Bridge\nFour’s bodyguards.\nSpeaking of fools…\n“Come with me,” Dalinar said to Amaram.\nAmaram let his horse lag behind. “I think I should go see to—”\n“Come,” Dalinar said sharply. “I want you to speak to that young man\nso we can put a stop to the rumors and the things he’s been saying about"

Those don’t do anyone any good.”\n“Very well,” Amaram said, catching up.\n* * *\nKaladin found himself standing up amid the bridgemen, despite the pain\nof his leg, as he noticed Adolin and Shallan riding past. He followed the\npair with his eyes. Adolin, astride his thick-hooved Ryshadium, and Shallan\non a more modestly sized brown animal.\nShe looked gorgeous. Kaladin was willing to admit it, if only to himself.\nBrilliant red hair, ready smile. She said something clever; Kaladin could\nalmost hear the words. He waited, hoping that she’d look toward him, meet\nhis eyes across the short distance.\nShe didn’t. She rode on, and Kaladin felt like an utter fool. A part of him\nwanted to hate Adolin for holding her attention, but he found that he\ncouldn’t. The truth was, he liked Adolin. And those two were good for one\nanother. They fit.\nPerhaps Kaladin could hate that.\nHe settled back down on a rock, bowing his head. The bridgemen\ncrowded in around him. Hopefully they hadn’t seen Kaladin following\nShallan with his eyes, straining to hear her voice. Renarin stood, like a\nshade, at the back of the group. The bridgemen were coming to accept him,\nbut he still seemed very awkward around them. Of course, he seemed\nawkward around most people.\nI need to talk to him more about his condition, Kaladin thought.\nSomething seemed off to him about that man and his explanation of the\nepilepsy.\n“Why are you here, sir?” Bisig asked, drawing Kaladin’s attention back\nto the other bridgemen.\n“I wanted to see you off,” Kaladin said, sighing. “I assumed you’d be\nhappy to see me.”\n“You are like child,” Rock said, wagging a thick finger at Kaladin.\n“What would you do, great Captain Stormblessed, if you caught one of\nthese men walking about with hurt leg? You would have that man beaten!\nOnce he healed, of course.”\n“I thought,” Kaladin noted, “that I was your commander.”\n“Nah, can’t be,” Teft said, “because our commander would be smart\nenough to stay in bed.”\n“And eat much stew,” Rock said. “I left you stew to eat while I am\ngone.”\n“You’re going on the expedition?” Kaladin asked, looking up at the\nlarge Horneater. “I thought you were just seeing the men off. You aren’t\nwilling to fight. What will you do out there?”\n“Someone must fix food for them,” Rock said. “This expedition, it will\ntake days. I will not leave my friends to the mercy of camp chefs. Ha! The\nfood they cook will all be from Soulcast grain and meat. Tastes like crem!\nSomeone must come with proper spices.”\nKaladin looked up at the group of frowning men. “Fine,” he said. “I’ll\ngo back. Storms, I…”\nWhy were the bridgemen parting?

Rock looked over his shoulder, then\nlaughed, backing away. “Now we shall see real trouble.”\nBehind them, Dalinar Kholin was climbing from his saddle. Kaladin\nsighed, then waved for Lopen to help him to his feet so he could salute\nproperly. He got upright—earning a glare from Teft—before noticing that\nDalinar was not alone.\nAmaram. Kaladin stiffened, straining to keep his face expressionless.\nDalinar and Amaram approached. The pain in Kaladin’s leg seemed to\nfade, and for the moment he could only see that man. That monster of a\nman. Wearing Plate Kaladin had earned, a golden cloak billowing out\nbehind, bearing the symbol of the Knights Radiant.\nControl yourself, Kaladin thought. He managed to swallow his rage.\nLast time it had gotten the better of him, he’d earned himself weeks in\nprison.\n“You should be resting, soldier,” Dalinar said.\n“Yes, sir,” Kaladin replied. “My men have already made that abundantly\nclear.”\n“Then you trained them well. I’m proud to have them along with me on\nthis expedition.”\nTeft saluted. “If there is danger to you, Brightlord, it will be out there on\nthe Plains. We can’t protect you if we wait back here.”\nKaladin frowned, realizing something. “Skar is here… Teft… so who is\nwatching the king?”\n“We’ve seen to it, sir,” Teft said. “Brightlord Dalinar asked me leave our\nbest man behind with a team of his own selection. They’ll watch the king.”\nTheir best man…\nColdness. Moash. Moash had been left in charge of the king’s safety,\nand had a team of his own choosing.\nStorms.\n“Amaram,” Dalinar said, waving for the highlord to step up. “You told\nme that you’d never seen this man before arriving here on the Shattered\nPlains. Is that true?”\nKaladin met the eyes of a murderer.\n“Yes,” Amaram said.\n“What of his claim that you took your Blade and Plate from him?”\nDalinar asked.\n“Brightlord,” Amaram said, taking Dalinar by the arm, “I don’t know if\nthe lad is touched in the head or merely starved for attention. Perhaps he\nserved in my army, as he claims—he certainly bears the correct slave brand.\nBut his allegations regarding me are obviously preposterous.”\nDalinar nodded to himself, as if this were all expected. “I believe an\napology is due.”\nKaladin struggled to remain upright, his leg feeling weak. So this would\nbe his final punishment. Apologizing to Amaram in public. A humiliation\nabove all others.\n“I—” Kaladin began.\n“Not you, son,” Dalinar said softly.\nAmaram turned, posture suddenly more alert—like that of a man\npreparing for a fight. “Surely you don’t believe these allegations, Dalinar!”\n“A few weeks ago,” Dalinar said, “I received two special visitors in\ncamp.

The other was that cargo: a madman who had\narrived at the gates of Kholinar carrying a Shardblade.”\nAmaram paled and stepped back, hand going to his side.\n“I told my servant,” Dalinar said calmly, “to go drinking with your\npersonal guard—he knew many of them—and talk of a treasure that the\nmadman said had been hidden for years outside the warcamp. By my order,\nhe then placed the madman’s Shardblade in a nearby cavern. After that, we\nwaited.”\nHe’s summoning his Blade, Kaladin thought, looking at Amaram’s hand.\nKaladin reached for his side knife, but Dalinar was already raising his own\nhand.\nWhite mist coalesced in Dalinar’s fingers, and a Shardblade appeared,\ntip to Amaram’s throat. Wider than most, it was almost cleaverlike in\nappearance.\nA Blade formed in Amaram’s hand a second later—a second too late.\nHis eyes went wide as he stared at the silvery Blade held to his throat.\nDalinar had a Shardblade.\n“I thought,” Dalinar said, “that if you had been willing to murder for\none Blade, you would certainly be willing to lie for a second. And so, after I\nknew you’d sneaked in to see the madman on your own, I asked you to\ninvestigate his claims for me. I gave your conscience plenty of time to come\nclean, out of respect for our friendship. When you told me you’d found\nnothing—but in fact you had actually recovered the Shardblade—I knew\nthe truth.”\n“How?” Amaram hissed, looking at the Blade Dalinar held. “How did\nyou get it back? I removed it from the cave. My men had it safe!”\n“I wasn’t about to risk it just to prove a point,” Dalinar said, cold. “I\nbonded this Blade before we hid it away.”\n“That week you spent ill,” Amaram said.\n“Yes.”\n“Damnation.”\nDalinar exhaled, a hissing sound through his teeth. “Why, Amaram? Of\nall people, I thought that you… Bah!” Dalinar’s grip on the weapon\ntightened, knuckles white. Amaram raised his chin, as if thrusting his neck\ntoward the point of the Shardblade.\n“I did it,” Amaram said, “and I would do it again. The Voidbringers will\nsoon return, and we must be strong enough to face them. That means\npracticed, accomplished Shardbearers. In sacrificing a few of my soldiers, I\nplanned to save many more.”\n“Lies!” Kaladin said, stumbling forward. “You just wanted the Blade for\nyourself!”\nAmaram looked Kaladin in the eyes. “I am sorry for what I did to you\nand yours. Sometimes, good men must die so that greater goals may be\naccomplished.”\nKaladin felt a gathering chill, a numbness that spread from his heart\noutward.\nHe’s telling the truth, he thought. He… honestly believes that he did the\nright thing.\nAmaram dismissed his Blade, turning back to Dalinar. “What now?”\n“You are guilty of murder—of killing men for personal wealth.”"

Sadeas could make it\nout through the spyglass.\nHe lowered it, and sat quietly for a long, long time. So long that his\nguards, and even his wife, started to fidget and looked nervous. But there\nwas no reason.\nHe quelled his annoyance.\n“Let them die out there,” he said. “All four. Ialai, make a report for me.\nI would like to know… Ialai?”\nHis wife started, looking toward him.\n“Is all well?”\n“I was merely thinking,” she said, seeming distant. “About the future.\nAnd what it is going to bring. For us.”\n“It is going to bring Alethkar new highprinces,” Sadeas said. “Make a\nreport of which among our sworn highlords would be appropriate to take\nthe place of those who will fall on Dalinar’s trip.” He tossed the spyglass\nback to the messenger. “We do nothing until they’re dead. This will end, it\nappears, with Dalinar killed by the Parshendi after all. Aladar can go with\nhim, and to Damnation with the lot of them.”"

Trust\nOne danger in deploying such a potent\nweapon will be the potential encouragement of\nthose exploring the Nahel bond. Care must be\ntaken to avoid placing these subjects in situations\nof powerful stress unless you accept the\nconsequences of their potential Investiture.\nFrom the Diagram, Floorboard 27:\nparagraph 6\nLike a river suddenly undammed, the four armies flooded out onto the\nplateaus. Shallan watched from horseback, excited, anxious. Her little part\nof the convoy included Vathah and her soldiers, along with Marri, her lady’s\nmaid. Gaz, notably, hadn’t arrived yet, and Vathah claimed to not know\nwhere he was. Perhaps she should have looked more into the nature of his\ndebts. She’d been so busy with other things… storms, if the man vanished,\nhow would she feel about that?\nShe would have to deal with that later. Today, she was part of something\nextremely important—a story that had begun with Gavilar and Dalinar’s\nfirst hunting expedition into the Unclaimed Hills years ago. Now came the\nfinal chapter, the mission that would unearth the truth and determine the\nfuture of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi, and perhaps Alethkar itself.\nShallan kicked her horse forward, eager. The gelding started to walk,\nplacid despite Shallan’s prodding.\nStorming animal.\nAdolin trotted up beside her on Sureblood. The beautiful animal was\npure white—not dusty grey, like some horses she’d seen, but actually white.\nThat Adolin should have the larger horse was patently unfair. She was\nshorter than he was, so she should be on the taller horse.\n“You purposely gave me a slow one,” Shallan complained, “didn’t\nyou?”\n“Sure did.”\n“I’d smack you. If I could reach you up there.”\nHe chuckled. “You said you don’t have a lot of experience riding, so I\npicked a horse that had a lot of experience being ridden. Trust me, you’ll be\nthankful.”\n“I want to ride in a majestic charge as we begin our expedition!”\n“And you can do so.”\n“Slowly.”\n“Technically, slow speeds can be very majestic.”\n“Technically,” she said, “a man doesn’t need all of his toes. Shall we\nremove a few of yours and prove it?”\nHe laughed. “As long as you don’t hurt my face, I suppose.”\n“Don’t be ridiculous. I like your face.”\nHe grinned, Shardplate helm hanging from his saddle so as to not mess\nup his hair. She waited for him to add a quip to hers, but he didn’t.\nThat was all right. She liked Adolin as he was. He was kind, noble, and\ngenuine. It didn’t matter that he wasn’t brilliant or… or whatever else\nKaladin was. She couldn’t even define it.

And a certain tempting arrogance. Not\nthe haughty pride of a highlord. Instead, the secure, stable sense of\ndetermination that whispered that no matter who you were—or what you\ndid—you could not hurt him. Could not change him.\nHe was. Like the wind and rocks were.\nShallan completely missed what Adolin said next. She blushed. “What\nwas that?”\n“I said that Sebarial has a carriage. You might want to travel with him.”\n“Because I’m too delicate for riding?” Shallan said. “Did you miss that I\nwalked back through the chasms in the middle of a highstorm?”\n“Um, no. But walking and riding are different. I mean, the soreness…”\n“Soreness?” Shallan asked. “Why would I be sore? Doesn’t the horse do\nall of the work?”\nAdolin looked at her, eyes widening.\n“Um,” she said. “Dumb question?”\n“You said you’d ridden before.”\n“Ponies,” she said, “on my father’s estates. Around in circles… All\nright, from that expression, I’m led to believe I’m being an idiot. When I\nget sore, I’ll go ride with Sebarial.”\n“Before you get sore,” Adolin said. “We’ll give it an hour.”\nAs annoyed as she was at this turn, she couldn’t deny his expertise.\nJasnah had once defined a fool as a person who ignored information\nbecause it disagreed with desired results.\nShe determined to not be bothered, and instead enjoy the ride. The army\nas a whole moved slowly, considering that each piece seemed to be so\nefficient. Spearmen in blocks, scribes on horseback, scouts roving outward.\nDalinar had six of the massive mechanical bridges, but he had also brought\nall of the former bridgemen and their simpler, man-carried bridges,\ndesigned as copies of the ones they’d left in Sadeas’s camp. That was good,\nsince Sebarial only had a couple of bridge crews.\nShe allowed herself a moment of personal satisfaction at the fact that\nhe’d come on the expedition. As she was thinking on that, she noticed\nsomeone running up the line of troops behind her. A short man, with an eye\npatch, who drew glares from Adolin’s bridgeman guards for the day.\n“Gaz?” Shallan said with relief as he hustled up, carrying a package\nunder his arm. Her fears that he’d been knifed in an alley somewhere were\nunfounded.\n“Sorry, sorry,” he said. “It came. You owe the merchant two sapphire\nbroams, Brightness.”\n“It?” Shallan asked, accepting the package.\n“Yeah. You asked me to find one for you. I storming did.” He seemed\nproud of himself.\nShe unwrapped the cloth around the rectangular object, and found inside\na book. Words of Radiance, the cover said. The sides were worn, and the\npages faded—one patch across the top was even stained from spilled ink\nsometime in the past.\nRarely had she been as pleased to receive something so damaged.\n“Gaz!” she said. “You’re wonderful!”"

The taller man rolled\nhis eyes, muttering something Shallan didn’t hear.\n“Thank you,” Shallan said. “Thank you truly, Gaz.”\n* * *\nAs the time passed and one day led into another, Shallan found the\ndistraction of the book extremely welcome. The armies moved about as fast\nas a herd of sleepy chulls, and the scenery was actually quite boring, though\nshe’d never admit that to Kaladin or Adolin, considering what she’d told\nthem last time she was out here.\nThe book, though. The book was wonderful. And frustrating.\nBut what was the “wicked thing of eminence” that led to the\nRecreance? she thought, writing the quote in her notebook. It was the\nsecond day of their travels on the Plains, and she had agreed to ride in the\ncoach Adolin had provided—alone, though it baffled Adolin why she\nwouldn’t want her lady’s maid with her. Shallan did not want to explain\nPattern to the girl.\nThe book had a chapter for each order of Knights Radiant, with talk of\ntheir traditions, their abilities, and their attitudes. The author admitted that a\nlot of it was hearsay—the book had been written two hundred years after\nthe Recreance, and by then facts, lore, and superstition had mixed freely.\nBeyond that, it was in an old dialect of Alethi, using the protoscript, a\nprecursor to the true women’s script of modern day. She spent a lot of her\ntime sorting out meanings, occasionally calling over some of Navani’s\nscholars to provide definitions or interpretation.\nStill, she had learned a great deal. For example, each order had different\nIdeals, or standards, to determine advancement. Some were specific, others\nleft to the interpretation of the spren. Also, some orders were\nindividualistic, while others—like the Windrunners—functioned in teams,\nwith a specific hierarchy.\nShe settled back, thinking about the powers described. Would the others\nbe appearing, then? As she and Jasnah had? Men who could glide elegantly\nacross the ground as if they weighed nothing, women who could melt stone\nwith a touch. Pattern had offered some few insights, but mostly he had been\nof use telling her what sounded likely to have been real, and what from the\nbook was a mistake based on hearsay. His memory was spotty, but growing\nmuch better, and hearing what the book said often made him remember\nmore.\nRight now, he buzzed on the seat beside her in a contented way. The\ncarriage hit a bump—it was rough out here—but at least in the coach, she\ncould read and reference other books at the same time. That would have\nbeen practically impossible while riding.\nThe coach did make her feel shut away, though. Not everyone who tries\nto take care of you is trying to do what your father did, she told herself\nfirmly.\nAdolin’s warned-of soreness had never manifested, of course.\nOriginally, she’d felt a small amount of pain in her thighs from holding"

        "text": "firmly.\nAdolin’s warned-of soreness had never manifested, of course.\nOriginally, she’d felt a small amount of pain in her thighs from holding\nherself in place in the saddle, but Stormlight had made it vanish.\n“Mmm,” Pattern said, climbing onto the door of the carriage. “It\ncomes.”\nShallan looked out the window and felt a drop of water sprinkle against\nher face. Rock darkened as rain coated it. Soon, the air filled with a steady\ndrizzle, light and pleasant. Though colder, it reminded her of some of the\nrainfalls back in Jah Keved. Here in the stormlands, it seemed that rain was\nrarely this soft.\nShe pulled down the shades and scooted to the center of the seat so she\nwouldn’t get rained on. She soon found that the pleasing sound of water\nmuffled the soldiers’ voices and the monotonous sound of marching feet,\nmaking it a nice accompaniment to reading. A quote sparked her interest,\nand so she dug out her sketch of the Shattered Plains and her old maps of\nStormseat.\nI need to find out how these maps relate, she thought. Multiple points of\nreference, preferably. If she could identify two places on the Shattered\nPlains that matched points on her map of Stormseat, she could judge how\nlarge Stormseat had been—the old map had no scale—and then overlay it\non the map of the Shattered Plains. That would give them some context.\nWhat really drew her attention was the Oathgate. On the map of\nStormseat, Jasnah thought it was represented by a round disc, like a dais, on\nthe southwestern side of the city. Was there a doorway there on that dais\nsomewhere? A magical portal to Urithiru? How did one of the knights\noperate it?\n“Mmm,” Pattern said.\nShallan’s carriage started to slow. She frowned, scooting to the door,\nmeaning to peek out the window. The door opened, however, to reveal\nHighlady Navani standing outside, Dalinar himself holding up an umbrella\nfor her.\n“Would you mind company?” Navani asked.\n“Not at all, Brightness,” Shallan said, scrambling to pick up her papers\nand books, which she’d spread about on all of the seats. Navani patted\nDalinar fondly on the arm, then climbed into the coach, using a towel to dry\nher feet and legs. She sat once Dalinar shut the door.\nThey started rolling again, and Shallan fidgeted with her papers. What\nwas her relationship with Navani? She was Adolin’s aunt, but she was\nromantically involved with his father. So she was kind of Shallan’s future\nmother-in-law, though by Vorin tradition Dalinar would never be allowed to\nmarry her.\nShallan had tried for weeks to get this woman to listen to her, and had\nfailed. Now, she seemed to have been forgiven for bearing the news of\nJasnah’s death. Did that mean Navani… liked her?\n“So,” Shallan said, feeling awkward, “did Dalinar exile you to the coach\nto protect you from getting sore, as Adolin did to me?”\n“Sore? Heavens no. If anyone should be riding in the coach, it’s Dalinar."

If anyone should be riding in the coach, it’s Dalinar.\nWhen there is fighting to be done, we’ll need him rested and ready. I came\nbecause it’s rather difficult to read while riding in the rain.”\n“Oh.” Shallan shifted in her seat.\nNavani studied her, then finally sighed. “I have been ignoring things,”\nthe older woman said, “that I should not. Because they bring me pain.”\n“I am sorry.”\n“You have nothing to apologize for.” Navani held out her hand toward\nShallan. “May I?”\nShallan looked at her handful of notes, diagrams, and maps. She\nhesitated.\n“You are engaged in work you obviously think very important,” Navani\nsaid softly. “This city Jasnah was searching for, according to the notes you\nsent me? Perhaps I can help you interpret my daughter’s intentions.”\nWas there anything in these pages that would incriminate Shallan and\nreveal her powers? Her activities as Veil?\nShe didn’t think so. She’d been studying the Knights Radiant as part of\nit, but she was searching for their center of power, so that made sense.\nHesitant, she handed over the papers.\nNavani leafed through them, reading by spherelight. “The organization\nof these notes is… interesting.”\nShallan blushed. The organization made sense to her. As Navani\ncontinued to look through the notes, Shallan found herself growing oddly\nanxious. She’d wanted Navani’s help—she’d all but begged for it. Now,\nhowever, she found herself feeling like this woman was intruding. This had\nbecome Shallan’s project, her duty and her quest. Now that Navani had\napparently overcome her grief, would she insist on taking over completely?\n“You think like an artist,” Navani said. “I can see it in the way you put\nthe notes together. Well, I suppose I can’t expect everything you do to be\nannotated precisely as I’d wish. A magical portal to another city? Jasnah\nactually believed in this?”\n“Yes.”\n“Hmm,” Navani said. “Then it’s probably true. That girl never did have\nthe decency to be wrong an appropriate amount of the time.”\nShallan nodded, glancing at the notes, feeling anxious.\n“Oh, don’t get so touchy,” Navani said. “I’m not going to steal the\nproject from you.”\n“I’m that transparent?” Shallan said.\n“This research is obviously very important to you. I assume Jasnah\npersuaded you that the fate of the world itself rested upon the answers you\nfind?”\n“She did.”\n“Damnation,” Navani said, flipping to the next page. “I shouldn’t have\nignored you. It was petty.”\n“It was the act of a grieving mother.”\n“Scholars don’t have time for such nonsense.” Navani blinked, and\nShallan caught a tear in the woman’s eye.\n“You’re still human,” Shallan said, reaching across, putting her hand on\nNavani’s knee. “We can’t all be emotionless chunks of rock like Jasnah.”\nNavani smiled. “She sometimes had the empathy of a corpse, didn’t\nshe?”\n“Comes from being too brilliant,” Shallan said. “You grow accustomed"

By age six, she was pointing out my logical fallacies as I\ntried to get her to go to bed on time.”\nShallan grinned. “I always just assumed she was born in her thirties.”\n“Oh, she was. It just took thirty-some years for her body to catch up.”\nNavani smiled. “I won’t take this from you, but neither should I allow you\nto attempt a project so important on your own. I would be part. Figuring out\nthe puzzles that captivated her… it will be like having her again. My little\nJasnah, insufferable and wonderful.”\nHow surreal it was to imagine Jasnah as a child being held by a mother.\n“It would be an honor to have your aid, Brightness Navani.”\nNavani held up the page. “You’re trying to overlay Stormseat with the\nShattered Plains. It’s not going to work unless you have a point of\nreference.”\n“Preferably two,” Shallan said.\n“It’s been centuries since that city fell. It was destroyed during\nAharietiam itself, I believe. We’re going to have trouble finding clues out\nhere, though your list of descriptions will help.” She tapped her finger\nagainst the papers. “This isn’t my area of expertise, but I have several\narchaeologists among Dalinar’s scribes. I should show them these pages.”\nShallan nodded.\n“We’ll want copies of everything here,” Navani said. “I don’t want to\nlose originals to all of this rain. I could have the scribes work on it tonight,\nafter we camp.”\n“If you wish.”\nNavani looked up at her, then frowned. “It is your decision.”\n“You’re serious?” Shallan asked.\n“Absolutely. Think of me as an additional resource.”\nAll right then. “Yes, have them make copies,” Shallan said, digging in\nher satchel. “And copies of this too—it’s my attempt at re-creating one of\nthe murals described as being on the outer wall of the temple to\nChanaranach in Stormseat. It faced leeward, and was supposedly shaded, so\nwe might be able to find hints of it.\n“Also, I need a surveyor to measure each new plateau we cross, once we\nget farther in. I can draw them out, but my spatial reasoning can be off. I\nwant exact sizes to make the map more accurate. I’ll need guards and\nscribes to ride out with me ahead of the army to visit plateaus parallel to our\ncourse. It would really help if you could convince Dalinar to allow this.\n“I’d like a team to study the quotes on that page underneath the map.\nThey talk about methods for opening the Oathgate, which was supposed to\nbe the duty of the Knights Radiant. Hopefully we can discover another\nmethod. Also, alert Dalinar that we’ll be trying to open the portal if we find\nit. I do not expect there to be anything dangerous on the other side, but he’ll\nundoubtedly want to send soldiers through first.”"

I need to say it. Say something.\n“She wasn’t trying. She succeeded.”\n“Succeeded?”\nShallan took a deep breath. “I don’t know what she said regarding the\norigin of her Soulcaster, but the truth was that it was a fake. Jasnah could\nSoulcast on her own, without any fabrial. I saw her do it. She knew secrets\nfrom the past, secrets I don’t think anyone else knows. Brightness Navani…\nyour daughter was one of the Knights Radiant.” Or as close to one as the\nworld was going to have again.\nNavani raised an eyebrow, obviously skeptical.\n“I swear this is true,” Shallan said, “on the tenth name of the Almighty.”\n“That is disturbing. Radiants, Heralds, and Voidbringers alike are\nsupposed to be gone. We won that war.”\n“I know.”\n“I will go get to work on this,” Navani said, knocking for the carriage\ndriver to halt the vehicle.\n* * *\nThe Weeping began.\nA steady stream of rain. Kaladin could hear it inside his room, like a\nwhisper in the background. Weak, miserable rain, without the fury and\npassion of a true highstorm.\nHe lay in the darkness, listening to the patter, feeling his leg throb. Wet,\ncold air leaked into his room, and he dug for the extra blankets that the\nquartermaster had delivered. He curled up and tried to sleep, but after\nsleeping most of the day yesterday—the day that Dalinar’s army had left—\nhe found himself wide awake.\nHe hated being wounded. Bed rest wasn’t supposed to happen to him.\nNot anymore.\nSyl…\nThe Weeping was a bad time for him. Days spent trapped indoors. A\nperpetual gloom in the sky that seemed to affect him more than it did\nothers, leaving him lethargic and uncaring.\nA knock came at his door. Kaladin raised his head in the darkness, then\nsat up and settled himself on his bench of a bed. “Come,” he said.\nThe door opened and let in the sound of rain, like a thousand little\nfootsteps scrambling about. Very little light accompanied the sounds. The\novercast sky of the Weeping left the land in perpetual twilight.\nMoash stepped in. He wore his Shardplate, as always. “Storms, Kal.\nWere you asleep?

That way, he’ll be committed and won’t turn back when he gets\nnews. Better for Alethkar if he succeeds at defeating the Parshendi.

Nobody\nwill be around to see what we do, nobody will get hurt, and they’ll all\nbelieve that the Shin assassin was behind this. We couldn’t have asked for\nthis to play out better! And you won’t have to do anything, Kal. Graves says\nthat we won’t need your help after all.”\n“So why are you here?” Kaladin asked.\n“I just wanted to check on you,” Moash said. He stepped in closer. “Is it\ntrue, what Lopen says? About your… abilities?”\nStorming Herdazian. Lopen had stayed behind—with Dabbid and\nHobber—to take care of the barrack and watch over Kaladin. They’d been\ntalking to Moash, it seemed.\n“Yes,” Kaladin said.\n“What happened?”\n“I’m not sure,” he lied. “I offended Syl. I haven’t seen her in days.\nWithout her, I can’t draw in Stormlight.”\n“We’ll have to fix that somehow,” Moash said. “Either that, or get you\nPlate and Blade of your own.”\nKaladin looked up at his friend. “I think she left because of the plot to\nkill the king, Moash. I don’t think a Radiant could be involved in something\nlike this.”\n“Shouldn’t a Radiant care about doing what is right? Even if it means a\ndifficult decision?”\n“Sometimes lives must be spent for the greater good,” Kaladin said.\n“Yes, exactly!”\n“That’s what Amaram said. In regards to my friends, whom he\nmurdered to cover up his secrets.”\n“Well, that’s different, obviously.

        "text": "interpretation that was not exact. Shallan was proud of it, as she’d captured\nJasnah’s contradictions.\nContradictions. Those were what made people real. Jasnah exhausted,\nyet somehow still strong—stronger, even, because of the vulnerability she\nrevealed. Jasnah terrified, yet also brave, for one allowed the other to exist.\nJasnah overwhelmed, yet powerful.\nShallan had recently been trying to do more drawings like this—ones\nsynthesized from her own imaginings. Her illusions would suffer if she\ncould only reproduce what she’d experienced. She needed to be able to\ncreate, not just copy.\nThe last creationspren faded away, this one imitating a puddle that was\nbeing splashed by a boot. Her sheet of paper dimpled as Pattern moved up\nonto it.\nHe sniffed. “Useless things.”\n“The creationspren?”\n“They don’t do anything. They flit around and watch, admire. Most\nspren have a purpose. These are merely attracted by someone else’s\npurpose.”\nShallan sat back, thinking on that, as Jasnah had taught her. Nearby, the\nscholars and ardents argued about how large Stormseat had been. Navani\nhad done her part well—better than Shallan could have hoped. The army’s\nscholars now worked at Shallan’s command.\nAround her in the night, an uncountable array of lights both near and far\nindicated the breadth of the army. The rain continued to sprinkle down,\ncatching the purple spherelight. She had chosen all spheres of one color.\n“The artist Eleseth,” Shallan observed to Pattern, “once did an\nexperiment. She set out only ruby spheres, in their strength, to light her\nstudio. She wanted to see what effect the all-red light would have upon her\nart.”\n“Mmmm,” Pattern said. “To what result?”\n“At first, during a painting session, the color of light affected her\nstrongly. She would use too little red, and fields of blossoms would look\nwashed out.”\n“Not unexpected.”\n“The interesting thing, however, was what happened if she continued\nworking,” Shallan said. “If she painted for hours by that light, the effects\ndiminished. The colors of her reproductions grew more balanced, the\npictures of flowers more vivid. She eventually concluded that her mind\ncompensated for the colors she saw. Indeed, if she switched the color of the\nlight during a session, she’d continue for a time to paint as if the room were\nstill red, reacting against the new color.”\n“Mmmmmm…” Pattern said, content. “Humans can see the world as it\nis not. It is why your lies can be so strong. You are able to not admit that\nthey are lies.”\n“It frightens me.”\n“Why? It is wonderful.”\nTo him, she was a subject of study. For a moment, she understood how\nKaladin must have seen Shallan as she spoke of the chasmfiend. Admiring\nits beauty, the form of its creation, oblivious to the present reality of its\ndanger.\n“It frightens me,” Shallan said, “because we all see the world by some\nkind of light personal to us, and that light changes our perception. I don’t\nsee clearly. I want to, but I don’t know if I ever truly can.”"

I want to, but I don’t know if I ever truly can.”\nEventually, a pattern broke through the sound of rain, and Dalinar\nKholin entered the tent. Straight-backed and greying, he looked more like a\ngeneral than a king. She had no sketches of him. It seemed a gross omission\non her part, so she took a Memory of him walking into the pavilion, an aide\nholding an umbrella for him.\nHe strode up to Shallan. “Ah, here you are. The one who has taken\ncommand of this expedition.”\nShallan belatedly scrambled to her feet and bowed. “Highprince?”\n“You have co-opted my scribes and cartographers,” Dalinar said,\nsounding amused. “They hum of it like the rainfall. Urithiru. Stormseat.\nHow did you do it?”\n“I didn’t. Brightness Navani did.”\n“She says you convinced her.”\n“I…” Shallan blushed. “I was really just there, and she changed her\nmind…”\nDalinar nodded curtly to the side, and his aide stepped over to the\ndebating scholars. The aide spoke with them softly, and they rose—some\nquickly, others with reluctance—and departed into the rain, leaving their\npapers. The aide followed them, and Vathah looked to Shallan. She nodded,\nexcusing him and the other guards.\nSoon Shallan and Dalinar were alone in the pavilion.\n“You told Navani that Jasnah had discovered the secrets of the Knights\nRadiant,” Dalinar said.\n“I did.”\n“You’re certain that Jasnah didn’t mislead you somehow,” Dalinar said,\n“or allow you to mislead yourself—that would be far more like her.”\n“Brightlord, I… I don’t think that is…” She took a breath. “No. She did\nnot mislead me.”\n“How can you be sure?”\n“I saw it,” Shallan said. “I witnessed what she did, and we spoke of it.\nJasnah Kholin did not use a Soulcaster. She was one.”\nDalinar folded his arms, looking past Shallan into the night. “I think I’m\nsupposed to refound the Knights Radiant. The first man I thought I could\ntrust for the job turned out to be a murderer and a liar. Now you tell me that\nJasnah might have had actual power. If that is true, then I am a fool.”\n“I don’t understand.”\n“In naming Amaram,” Dalinar said. “I did what I thought was my task. I\nwonder now if I was mistaken all along, and that refounding them was\nnever my duty. They might be refounding themselves, and I am an arrogant\nmeddler. You have given me a great deal to think upon. Thank you.”\nHe did not smile as he said it; in fact, he looked severely troubled. He\nturned to leave, clasping his hands behind his back.\n“Brightlord Dalinar?” Shallan said. “What if your task wasn’t to refound\nthe Knights Radiant?”\n“That is what I just said,” Dalinar replied.\n“What if instead, your task was to gather them?”\nHe looked back to her, waiting. Shallan felt a cold sweat. What was she\ndoing?"

What was she\ndoing?\nI have to tell someone sometime, she thought. I can’t do as Jasnah did,\nholding it all. This is too important. Was Dalinar Kholin the right person?\nWell, she certainly couldn’t think of anyone better.\nShallan held out her palm, then breathed in, draining one of her spheres.\nThen she breathed back out, sending a cloud of shimmering Stormlight into\nthe air between herself and Dalinar. She formed it into a small image of\nJasnah, the one she’d just drawn, on top of her palm.\n“Almighty above,” Dalinar whispered. A single awespren, like a ring of\nblue smoke, burst out above him, spreading like the ripple from a stone\ndropped in a pond. Shallan had seen such a spren only a handful of times in\nher life.\nDalinar stepped closer, reverent, leaning down to inspect Shallan’s\nimage. “Can I?” he asked, reaching out a hand.\n“Yes.”\nHe touched the image, causing it to fuzz back into shifting light. When\nhe withdrew his finger, the image re-formed.\n“It’s just an illusion,” Shallan said. “I can’t create anything real.”\n“It’s amazing,” Dalinar said, his voice so soft she could barely hear it\nover the pattering rain. “It is wonderful.” He looked up at her, and there\nwere—shockingly—tears in his eyes. “You’re one of them.”\n“Maybe, kind of?” Shallan said, feeling awkward. This man, so\ncommanding, so much larger than life, should not be crying in front of her.\n“I’m not mad,” he said, more to himself, it seemed. “I had decided that I\nwasn’t, but that’s not the same as knowing. It’s all true. They’re returning.”\nHe tapped at the image again. “Jasnah taught you this?”\n“I more stumbled into it on my own,” Shallan said. “I think I was led to\nher so she could teach me. We didn’t have much time for that,\nunfortunately.” She grimaced, withdrawing the Stormlight, heart beating\nquickly because of what she’d done.\n“I need to give you the golden cape,” Dalinar said, standing up straight,\nwiping his eyes and growing firm of voice again. “Put you in charge of\nthem. So we—”\n“Me?” Shallan yelped, thinking of what that would mean to her\nalternate identity. “No, I can’t! I mean, Brightlord, sir, what I can do is\nmostly useful if nobody knows it’s possible. I mean, if everyone is looking\nfor my illusions, I’ll never fool them.”\n“Fool them?” Dalinar said.\nPerhaps the not best choice of words for Dalinar.\n“Brightlord Dalinar!”\nShallan spun, alert, suddenly worried that someone had seen what she\ndid. A lithe messenger approached the tent, dripping wet, locks of hair\nundone from her braids and sticking to her face. “Brightlord Dalinar!\nParshendi spotted, sir!”\n“Where?”"

A lithe messenger approached the tent, dripping wet, locks of hair\nundone from her braids and sticking to her face. “Brightlord Dalinar!\nParshendi spotted, sir!”\n“Where?”\n“Eastern side of this plateau,” the messenger said, panting. “Scouting\nparty, we think.”\nDalinar looked from the messenger to Shallan, then cursed and started\nout into the rain.\nShallan tossed her sketchpad onto her chair and followed.\n“This could be dangerous,” Dalinar said.\n“I appreciate the concern, Brightlord,” she said softly. “But I think I\ncould actually take a spear through the stomach, and my abilities would\nheal me up without a scar. I’m probably the most difficult person to kill in\nthis entire camp.”\nDalinar strode in silence for a moment. “The fall into the chasm?” he\nasked softly.\n“Yes. I think I must have rescued Captain Kaladin too, though I don’t\nknow how I managed that.”\nHe grunted. They moved quickly through the rain, the water wetting\nShallan’s hair and clothing. She practically had to jog to keep pace with\nDalinar. Storming Alethi and their long legs. Guards ran up, members of\nBridge Four, and fell in around them.\nShe heard shouting in the distance. Dalinar sent the guards into a wider\nperimeter to give himself and Shallan a measure of privacy.\n“Can you Soulcast?” Dalinar asked softly. “Like Jasnah did?”\n“Yes,” Shallan said. “But I haven’t practiced it much.”\n“It could prove very useful.”\n“It’s also very dangerous. Jasnah didn’t want me practicing without her,\nthough now that she’s gone… Well, I will do more with it, eventually. Sir,\nplease don’t tell anyone about this. For now, at least.”\n“This was why Jasnah took you on as a ward,” Dalinar said. “It’s why\nshe wanted you marrying Adolin, isn’t it? To bind you to us?”\n“Yes,” Shallan said, blushing in the darkness.\n“A great many things make more sense now. I will tell Navani about\nyou, but nobody else, and I will swear her to secrecy. She can keep a secret,\nif she has to.”\nShe opened her mouth to say yes, but stopped herself. Was that what\nJasnah would have said?\n“We’ll send you back to the warcamps,” Dalinar continued, eyes\nforward, speaking softly. “Immediately, with an escort. I don’t care how\nhard you are to kill. You’re too valuable to risk on this expedition.”\n“Brightlord,” Shallan said, splashing through a pool of water, glad she\nwas wearing boots and leggings under the skirt, “you are not my king, nor\nare you my highprince. You have no authority over me. My duty is to find\nUrithiru, so you will not be sending me back. And, by your honor, I will\nhave your promise not to tell a soul what I can do unless I give leave. That\nincludes Brightness Navani.”\nHe stopped in place, and stared at her in surprise. Then he grunted, his\nface barely visible. “I see Jasnah in you.”\nRarely had Shallan been given such a compliment.\nLights bobbed and approached in the rain, soldiers bearing sphere"

Vathah and his men jogged up, having been left behind, and\nBridge Four held them back for the moment.\n“Very well, Brightness,” Dalinar said to Shallan. “Your secret will\nremain one, for now. We will consult further, once this expedition is done.\nYou have read of the things I have been seeing?”\nShe nodded.\n“The world is about to change,” Dalinar said. He took a deep breath.\n“You give me hope, true hope, that we can change it in the right way.”\nThe approaching scouts saluted, and Bridge Four parted to allow their\nleader access to Dalinar. He was a portly man with a brown hat that\nreminded her of the one Veil wore, except it was wide-brimmed. The scout\nwore soldier’s trousers, but a leather jacket over them, and certainly didn’t\nseem in fighting shape.\n“Bashin,” Dalinar said.\n“Parshendi on that plateau next to us, sir,” Bashin said, pointing. “The\nParshendi stumbled over one of my scouting teams. The lads raised the\nalarm quickly, but we lost all three men.”\nDalinar cursed softly, then turned toward Highlord Teleb, who had\napproached from the other direction, wearing his Shardplate, which he’d\npainted silver. “Wake the army, Teleb. Everyone on alert.”\n“Yes, Brightlord,” Teleb said.\n“Brightlord Dalinar,” Bashin said, “the lads took down one of those\nshellheads before being killed themselves. Sir… you need to see this.\nSomething has changed.”\nShallan shivered, feeling sodden and cold. She’d brought clothing that\nwould last well in the rain, of course, but that didn’t mean standing out here\nwas comfortable. Though they wore coats, nobody else seemed to pay much\nheed. Likely, they took it for granted that during the Weeping, you were\ngoing to get soaked. That was something else for which her sheltered\nchildhood had not prepared her.\nDalinar did not object as Shallan joined him in walking toward a nearby\nbridge—one of the more mobile ones run by Kaladin’s bridge teams, who\nwore raincoats and front-brimmed caps. A group of soldiers on the other\nside of the bridge dragged something across, pushing a little wave of water\nbefore it. A Parshendi corpse.\nShallan had only seen the one that she’d found with Kaladin in the\nchasm. She’d done a sketch of that earlier, and this one looked very\ndifferent. It had hair—well, a kind of hair. Leaning down, she found that it\nwas thicker than human hair, and felt too… slick. Was that the right word?\nThe face was marbled, like that of a parshman, this one with prominent red\nstreaks through the black. The body was lean and strong, and something\nseemed to grow under the skin of the exposed arms, peeking out. Shallan\nprodded at it, and found it hard and ridged, like a crab shell.

In fact, the face\nwas crusted with a kind of thin, bumpy carapace just above the cheeks and\nrunning back around the sides of the head.\n“This isn’t a type we’ve seen before, sir,” Bashin said to Dalinar. “Look\nat those ridges. Sir… some of the lads that were killed, they had burn marks\non them. In the rain. Shakiest thing I’ve ever seen…”\nShallan looked up at them. “What do you mean by a ‘type,’ Bashin?”\n“Some Parshendi have hair,” the man said—he was a darkeyes, but\nclearly well respected, though he didn’t bear an obvious military rank.\n“Others have carapace. The ones we met with King Gavilar long ago, they\nwere… shaped different from the ones we fight.”\n“They have specialized subspecies?” Shallan said. Some cremlings were\nlike that, working in a hive, with different specializations and varied forms.\n“We might be depleting their numbers,” Dalinar said to Bashin.\n“Forcing them to send out their equivalent of lighteyes to fight.”\n“And the burns, Dalinar?” Bashin said, scratching his head under his\nhat.\nShallan reached out to check the Parshendi’s eye color. Did they have\nlighteyes and dark, like humans? She lifted the eyelid.\nThe eye beneath was completely red.\nShe screamed, jumping back, pulling her hand up to her chest. The\nsoldiers cursed, looking around, and Dalinar’s Shardblade appeared in his\nhand a few seconds later.\n“Red eyes,” Shallan whispered. “It’s happening.”\n“The red eyes are just a legend.”\n“Jasnah had an entire notebook of references to this, Brightlord,”\nShallan said, shivering. “The Voidbringers are here. Time is short.”\n“Throw the body into the chasm,” Dalinar said to his men. “I doubt\nwe’d be able to easily burn it. Keep everyone alert. Be prepared for an\nattack tonight. They—”\n“Brightlord!”\nShallan spun as a hulking armored figure came up, rainwater trailing\ndown his silvery Plate. “We’ve found another one, sir,” Teleb said.\n“Dead?” Dalinar said.\n“No, sir,” the Shardbearer said, pointing. “He walked right up to us, sir.\nHe’s sitting on a rock over there.”\nDalinar looked to Shallan, who shrugged. Dalinar started off in the\ndirection Teleb had pointed.\n“Sir?” Teleb said, voice resonating inside his helm. “Should you…”\nDalinar ignored the warning, and Shallan hastened after him, collecting\nVathah and his two guards.\n“Should you head back?” Vathah said under his breath to her. Storms,\nbut that face of his looked dangerous in the dim light, even if his voice was\nrespectful. She couldn’t help but still see him as the man who had almost\nkilled her, back in the Unclaimed Hills.\n“I will be safe,” Shallan replied softly.\n“You might have a Blade, Brightness, but you could still die to an arrow\nin the back.”\n“Unlikely, in this rain,” she said."

He was trying to do\nthe job she had assigned him. Unfortunately, she was discovering that she\ndidn’t much like being guarded.\nThey found the Parshendi after a hike through the rain. The rock he sat\non was about as high as a man was tall. He seemed to have no weapons, and\nabout a hundred Alethi soldiers stood around the base of his seat, spears\npointed upward. Shallan couldn’t make out much more, as he sat across the\nchasm from them, a portable bridge in place to his plateau.\n“Has he said anything?” Dalinar asked softly as Teleb stepped up.\n“Not that I know of,” the Shardbearer said. “He just sits there.”\nShallan peered across the chasm toward the solitary Parshendi man. He\nstood up, and shaded his eyes against the rain. The soldiers below shuffled,\nspears rising into more threatening positions.\n“Skar?” the Parshendi’s voice called. “Skar, is that you? And Leyten?”\nNearby, one of Dalinar’s bridgeman guards cursed. He ran across the\nbridge, and several other bridgemen followed.\nThey returned a moment later. Shallan crowded in closely to hear what\ntheir leader whispered to Dalinar.\n“It’s him, sir,” Skar said. “He’s changed, but storm me for a fool if I’m\nwrong—it’s him. Shen. He ran bridges with us for months, then vanished.\nNow he’s here. He says he wants to surrender to you.”\n79.

She hung\nher stormcoat on the rack beside the flap, and Adolin grabbed a towel and\nbegan drying his hair and face.\nAdolin was betrothed to a member of the Knights Radiant. She says\nshe’s not one yet, Dalinar reminded himself. That made sense. One could be\na trained spearman without being a soldier. One implied skill, the other a\nposition.\n“They are bringing the Parshendi man?” Dalinar asked.\n“Yes,” Navani said, sitting down in one of the room’s chairs. Adolin\ndidn’t take his seat, but found a pitcher of filtered rainwater and poured\nhimself a cup. He tapped the side of the tin cup as he drank.\nThey were restless, all of them, following the discovery of red-eyed\nParshendi. After no attack had come that night, Dalinar had pushed the\nthree armies into another day of marching.\nSlowly, they approached the middle of the Plains, at least as Shallan’s\nprojections indicated. They were already well beyond the regions that\nscouts had explored. Now, they had to rely on the young woman’s maps.\nThe flaps opened again, and Teleb marched in with the prisoner. Dalinar\nhad put the highlord and his personal guard in charge of this “Rlain,” as he\ndidn’t like how defensive the bridgemen were about him. He did invite their\nlieutenants—Skar and the Horneater cook they called Rock—to come to the\ninterrogation, and those two entered after Teleb and his men. General Khal\nand Renarin were in another tent with Aladar and Roion, going over tactics\nfor when they approached the Parshendi encampment.\nNavani sat up, leaning forward, narrowing her eyes at the prisoner.\nShallan had wanted to attend, but Dalinar had promised to have everything\nwritten down for her. The Stormfather had given her some sense,\nfortunately, and she hadn’t insisted. Having too many of them near this spy\nfelt dangerous to Dalinar.\nHe had a vague recollection of the parshman guard who had\noccasionally joined the men of Bridge Four. Parshmen were practically\ninvisible, but once this one had started carrying a spear, he had become\ninstantly noticeable. Not that there had been anything else distinctive about\nhim—same squat parshman body, marbled skin, dull eyes.\nThis creature before him was nothing like that. He was a full Parshendi\nwarrior, complete with orange-red skullplate and armored carapace at the\nchest, thighs, and outer arms. He was as tall as an Alethi, and more\nmuscular.\nThough he carried no weapon, the guards still treated him as if he were\nthe most dangerous thing on this plateau—and perhaps he was just that. As\nhe stepped up, he saluted Dalinar, hand to chest. Like the other bridgemen.\nHe bore their tattoo on his forehead, reaching up and blending into his\nskullplate.\n“Sit,” Dalinar ordered, nodding toward a stool at the center of the room.\nRlain obeyed.\n“I’m told,” Dalinar said, “that you refuse to tell us anything about the\nParshendi plans.”"

He had the rhythmic intonations\ncommon to the Parshendi, but he spoke Alethi very well. Better than any\nparshman Dalinar had heard.\n“You were a spy,” Dalinar said, hands clasped behind his back, trying to\nloom over the Parshendi—but staying far enough away that the man could\nnot grab him without Adolin getting in the way first.\n“Yes, sir.”\n“For how long?”\n“About three years,” Rlain said. “In various warcamps.”\nNearby, Teleb—faceplate up—turned and raised an eyebrow at Dalinar.\n“You answer me when I ask,” Dalinar said. “But not the others. Why?”\n“You’re my commanding officer,” Rlain said.\n“You’re Parshendi.”\n“I…” The man looked down at the ground, shoulders bowing. He raised\na hand to his head, feeling at the ridge of skin just where his skullplate\nended. “Something is very wrong, sir. Eshonai’s voice… on the plateau that\nday, when she came to meet with Prince Adolin…”\n“Eshonai,” Dalinar prompted. “The Parshendi Shardbearer?” Nearby,\nNavani scribbled on a pad of paper, writing down each word spoken.\n“Yes. She was my commander. But now…” He looked up, and despite\nthe alien skin and the strange way of speaking, Dalinar recognized grief in\nthis man’s face. Terrible grief. “Sir, I have reason to believe that everyone I\nknow… everyone I loved… has been destroyed, monsters left in their place.\nThe listeners, the Parshendi, may be no more. I have nothing left…”\n“Yes you do,” Skar said from outside the ring of guards. “You’re Bridge\nFour.”\nRlain looked at him. “I’m a traitor.”\n“Ha!” Rock said. “Is little problem. Can be fixed.”\nDalinar gestured to quiet the bridgemen. He glanced at Navani, who\nnodded for him to continue.\n“Tell me,” Dalinar said, “how you hid among the parshmen.”\n“I…”\n“Soldier,” Dalinar barked. “That was an order.”\nRlain sat up. Amazingly, he seemed to want to obey—as if he needed\nsomething to lend him strength. “Sir,” Rlain said, “it’s just something my\npeople can do. We choose a form based on what we need, the job required\nof us. Dullform, one of those forms, looks a lot like a parshman. Hiding\namong them is easy.”\n“We account our parshmen with precision,” Navani said.\n“Yes,” Rlain replied, “and we are noticed—but rarely questioned. Who\nquestions when you find an extra sphere lying on the ground? It’s not\nsomething suspicious. It’s merely fortune.”\nDangerous territory, Dalinar thought, noticing the change in Rlain’s\nvoice—the beat to which he was speaking. This man did not like how the\nparshmen were treated.\n“You spoke of the Parshendi,” Dalinar said. “This has to do with the red\neyes?”\nRlain nodded."

He stooped down, laying an arm on the Parshendi man’s shoulder.\n“Soldier,” Dalinar said, “if what you’re telling me is correct, then the\nmost important thing you can do is lead us to your people. I will see that the\nnoncombatants are protected, my word of honor on it. If something terrible\nis happening to your people, you need to help me stop it.”\n“I…” Rlain took a deep breath. “Yes, sir,” he said to a different rhythm.\n“Meet with Shallan Davar,” Dalinar said. “Describe the route to her, and\nget us a map. Teleb, you may release the prisoner into the custody of Bridge\nFour.”\nThe Oldblood Shardbearer nodded. As the group of them left, letting in\na gust of rainy wind, Dalinar sighed and sat down beside Navani.\n“You trust his word?”\n“I don’t know,” Dalinar said. “But something did shake that man,\nNavani. Soundly.”\n“He’s Parshendi,” she said. “You may be misreading his body\nlanguage.”\nDalinar leaned forward, clasping his hands before him. “The\ncountdown?” he asked.\n“Three days away,” Navani said. “Three days before Lightday.”\nSo little time. “We hasten our pace,” he said.\nInward.

She pulled\nherself up the rocks. The Shattered Plains had grown increasingly rough as\nthe armies traveled inward—now on their eighth day of the expedition—\nfollowing Shallan’s map, created with the help of Rlain, the former\nbridgeman.\nShallan crested the rock formation and found the view that the scouts\nhad described. Vathah and Gaz stomped up behind her, muttering about the\ncold. The heart of the Shattered Plains extended before Shallan. The inner\nplateaus, never explored by men.\n“It’s here,” she said.\nGaz scratched at the socket beneath his eye patch. “Rocks?”\n“Yes, guardsman Gaz,” Shallan said. “Rocks. Beautiful, wonderful\nrocks.”\nIn the distance, she saw shadows draped in a veil of misty rain. Seen\ntogether in a group like this, it was unmistakable. This was a city. A city\ncovered over with centuries’ worth of crem, like children’s blocks dribbled\nwith many coats of melted wax. To the innocent eye, it undoubtedly looked\nmuch like the rest of the Shattered Plains. But it was oh so much more.\nIt was proof. Even this formation Shallan stood upon had probably once\nbeen a building. Weathered on the stormward side, dribbled with crem\ndown the leeward side to create the bulbous, uneven slope they had\nclimbed.\n“Brightness!”\nShe ignored the voices from down below, instead waving impatiently\nfor the spyglass. Gaz handed it to her, and she raised it to inspect the\nplateaus ahead. Unfortunately, the thing had fogged up on one end. She\ntried to rub it clean, rain washing over her, but the fog was on the inside.\nBlasted device.\n“Brightness?” Gaz asked. “Shouldn’t we, uh, listen to what they’re\nsaying down below?”\n“More twisted Parshendi spotted,” Shallan said, raising the spyglass\nagain. Wouldn’t the designer of the thing have built it to be sealed on the\ninside, to prevent moisture from getting in?\nGaz and Vathah stepped back as several members of Bridge Four\nreached the top of the incline.\n“Brightness,” one of the bridgemen said, “Highprince Dalinar has\nwithdrawn the vanguard and ordered a secure perimeter on the plateau\nbehind us.” He was a tall, handsome man whose arms seemed entirely too\nlong for his body. Shallan looked with dissatisfaction at the inner plateaus.\n“Brightness,” the bridgeman continued reluctantly, “he did say that if\nyou wouldn’t come, he would send Adolin to… um… cart you back over\nhis shoulder.”\n“I would like to see him do that,” Shallan said. It did sound kind of\nromantic, the sort of thing you’d read of in a novel. “He’s that worried\nabout the Parshendi?”\n“Shen… er, Rlain… says we’re practically to their home plateau,\nBrightness. Too many of their patrols have been spotted. Please.”\n“We need to get in there,” Shallan said, pointing. “That’s where the\nsecrets are.”\n“Brightness…”"

Please.”\n“We need to get in there,” Shallan said, pointing. “That’s where the\nsecrets are.”\n“Brightness…”\n“Very well,” she said, turning and hiking down the incline. She slipped,\nwhich did not help her dignity, but Vathah caught her arm before she\ntumbled onto her face.\nOnce down, they quickly crossed this smaller plateau, joining scouts\nwho were jogging back toward the bulk of the army. Rlain claimed to know\nnothing himself of the Oathgate—or even really much about the city, which\nhe called “Narak” instead of Stormseat. He said his people had only taken\nup permanent residence here following the Alethi invasion.\nDuring the push inward, Dalinar’s soldiers had spotted an increasing\nnumber of Parshendi and had clashed with them in brief skirmishes.\nGeneral Khal thought that the forays had been intended to draw the army\noff course, though how they would figure that, Shallan didn’t know—but\nshe did know she was growing tired of feeling damp all the time. They had\nbeen out here nearly two weeks now, and some of the soldiers had begun to\nmutter that the army would need to return to the warcamps soon, or risk not\ngetting back before the highstorms resumed.\nShallan stalked across the bridge and passed several lines of spearmen\nsetting up behind short, wavelike ridges in the stone—likely the footings of\nold walls. She found Dalinar and the other highprinces in a tent set up at the\ncenter of camp. It was one of six identical tents, and it wasn’t immediately\nobvious which one held the four highprinces. A safety precaution of some\nsort, she assumed. As Shallan stepped in out of the rain, she intruded upon\ntheir conversation.\n“The current plateau does have very favorable defensible positions,”\nAladar said, gesturing toward a map set out on the travel table before them.\n“I prefer our chances against an assault here to moving deeper.”\n“And if we move deeper,” Dalinar said with a grunt, “we’ll be in danger\nof getting split during an attack, half on one plateau, half on the other.”\n“But do they even need to attack?” Roion said. “If I were them, I’d just\nform up out there as if to prepare for an attack—but then I wouldn’t. I’d\nstall, forcing my enemy to get stuck out here waiting for an attack until the\nhighstorms returned!”\n“He makes a valid point,” Aladar admitted.\n“Trust a coward,” Sebarial said, “to know the smartest way to stay out\nof fighting.” He sat with Palona beside the table, eating fruit and smiling\npleasantly.\n“I am not a coward,” Roion said, forming fists at his sides.\n“I didn’t mean it as an insult,” Sebarial said. “My insults are far more\npithy. That was a compliment. If I had my way, I’d hire you to run all wars,\nRoion. I suspect there would be far fewer casualties, and the price of\nundergarments would double once soldiers were told that you were in\ncharge. I’d make a fortune.”\nShallan handed her dripping coat to a servant, then took off her cap and\nbegan drying her hair with a towel. “We need to press closer to the center of"

I’d make a fortune.”\nShallan handed her dripping coat to a servant, then took off her cap and\nbegan drying her hair with a towel. “We need to press closer to the center of\nthe Plains,” she said. “Roion is right. I refuse to let us bivouac. The\nParshendi will just wait us out.”\nThe others looked to her.\n“I wasn’t aware,” Dalinar said, “that you decided our tactics, Brightness\nShallan.”\n“It’s our own fault, Dalinar,” Sebarial said, “for giving her so much\nleeway. We probably should have tossed her off the Pinnacle weeks ago, the\nmoment she arrived at that meeting.”\nShallan was stirring up a retort as the tent flaps parted and Adolin\ntrudged in, Shardplate streaming. He pushed up his faceplate. Storms… he\nlooked so good, even when you could see only half his face. She smiled.\n“They are definitely agitated,” Adolin said. He saw her, and gave her a\nquick smile before clinking up to the table. “There are at least ten thousand\nof those twisted Parshendi out there, moving in groups around the\nplateaus.”\n“Ten thousand,” Aladar said with a grunt. “We can take ten thousand.\nEven with them having the terrain advantage, even if we have to assault\nrather than defend, we should handle that many with ease. We have over\nthirty thousand.”\n“This is what we came to do,” Dalinar said. He looked at Shallan, who\nblushed at her forwardness earlier. “Your portal, the one you think is out\nhere. Where would it be?”\n“Closer to the city,” Shallan said.\n“What of those red eyes?” Roion asked. He looked very uncomfortable.\n“And the flashes of light they cause when they fight? Storms, when I spoke\nearlier, I didn’t mean that I wanted us to go farther. I was just worried at\nwhat the Parshendi would do. I… there’s no easy way to do this, is there?”\n“So far as Rlain has said,” Navani said from her seated position at the\nside of the room, “only their soldiers can jump between plateaus, but we\ncan assume the new form capable of it as well. They can flee us if we push\nforward.”\nDalinar shook his head. “They set up on the Plains, rather than fleeing\nall those years ago, because they knew it was their best chance for survival.\nOn the open, unbroken rock of the stormlands, they could be hunted and\ndestroyed. Out here they have the advantage. They won’t abandon it now.\nNot if they think they can fight us.”\n“If we want to make them fight, then,” Aladar said, “we need to threaten\ntheir homes. I guess we really should press toward the city.”\nShallan relaxed. Each step closer to the center—by Rlain’s explanations,\nthey were but half a day away—got her closer to the Oathgate.\nDalinar leaned forward, spreading his hands to the sides, his shadow\nfalling on the battle maps. “Very well. I did not come all this way to timidly\nwait upon Parshendi whims. We’ll march inward tomorrow, threaten their\ncity, and force them to engage.”"

We’ll march inward tomorrow, threaten their\ncity, and force them to engage.”\n“The closer we get,” Sebarial noted, “the more likely we are to become\ncut off without hope of retreat.”\nDalinar didn’t respond, but Shallan knew what he was thinking. We\ngave up hope of retreat days ago. A flight across days and days of plateaus\nwould be a disaster if the Parshendi decided to harry. The Alethi fought\nhere, and they won, seizing the shelter of Narak.\nThat was their only option.\nDalinar adjourned the meeting, and the highprinces left, surrounded by\ngroups of aides holding umbrellas. Shallan waited as Dalinar caught her\neyes. In moments only she, Dalinar, Adolin, and Navani remained.\nNavani walked up to Dalinar, taking his arm with both of hers. An\nintimate posture.\n“This portal of yours,” Dalinar said.\n“Yes?” Shallan asked.\nDalinar looked up and met her eyes. “How real is it?”\n“Jasnah was convinced it was completely real. She was never wrong.”\n“This would be a storming bad time for her to break her record,” he said\nsoftly. “I agreed to press forward, in part, because of your exploration.”\n“Thank you.”\n“I did not do it for scholarship,” Dalinar said. “From what Navani tells\nme, this portal offers a unique opportunity for retreat. I had hoped to defeat\nthe Parshendi before danger overtook us, whatever it was. Judging by what\nwe’ve seen, danger has arrived early.”\nShallan nodded.\n“Tomorrow is the last day of the countdown,” Dalinar said. “Scribbled\non the walls during highstorms. Whatever it is, whatever it was, we meet it\ntomorrow—and you are my backup plan, Shallan Davar. You will find this\nportal, and you will make it work. If the evil overwhelms us, your pathway\nwill be our escape. You may be the only chance that our armies—and\nindeed, Alethkar itself—have for survival.”\n* * *\nDays passed, and Kaladin refused to let the rain overcome him.\nHe limped through the camp, using a crutch that Lopen had fetched for\nhim despite objecting that it was too soon for Kaladin to be up and about.\nThe place was still empty, save for the occasional parshmen lugging\nwood from the forests outside or carrying sacks of grain. The camp didn’t\nget any news about the expedition. The king was probably being sent word\nvia spanreed, but he didn’t share it with everyone else.\nStorms, this place feels eerie, Kaladin thought, limping past deserted\nbarracks, rain pattering against the umbrella that Lopen had tied to\nKaladin’s crutch. It worked. Kind of. He passed rainspren, like blue candles\nsprouting from the ground, each with a single eye in the center of its top.\nCreepy things.

The rain wanted him to give in to\nthe despair, so he forced himself to think. Growing up, he’d had Tien to\nhelp lighten the gloom. Now, even thinking of Tien increased that gloom\ninstead—though he couldn’t avoid it. The Weeping reminded him of his\nbrother. Of laughter when the darkness threatened, of cheerful joy and\ncarefree optimism.\nThose images warred with ones of Tien’s death. Kaladin squeezed his\neyes shut, trying to banish that memory. Of the frail young man, barely\ntrained, being cut down. Tien’s own company of soldiers had put him at the\nfront as a distraction, a sacrifice to slow the enemy.\nKaladin set his jaw, opening his eyes. No more moping. He would not\nwhine or wallow. Yes, he’d lost Syl. He’d lost many loved ones during his\nlife. He would survive this agony as he had survived the others.\nHe continued his limping circuit of the barracks. He did this four times\na day. Sometimes Lopen came with him, but today Kaladin was alone. He\nsplashed through puddles of water, and found himself smiling because he\nwore the boots Shallan had stolen from him.\nI never did believe she was a Horneater, he thought. I need to make sure\nshe knows that.\nHe stopped, leaning on the crutch and looking out through the rain\ntoward the Shattered Plains. He couldn’t see far. The haze of rainfall\nprevented that.\nYou come back safely, he thought to those out there. All of you. This\ntime, I can’t help you if something goes wrong.\nRock, Teft, Dalinar, Adolin, Shallan, everyone in Bridge Four—all out\non their own. How different a place would the world be if Kaladin had been\na better man? If he’d used his powers and had returned to the warcamp with\nShallan full of Stormlight? He had been so close to revealing what he could\ndo…\nYou’d been thinking that for weeks, he thought to himself. You’d never\nhave done it. You were too scared.\nHe hated admitting it, but it was true.\nWell, if his suspicions about Shallan were true, perhaps Dalinar would\nhave his Radiant anyway. May she make a better run of it than Kaladin had.\nHe continued on his limping way, rounding back to Bridge Four’s\nbarrack. He stopped when he saw a fine carriage, pulled by horses bearing\nthe king’s livery, waiting in front of it.\nKaladin cursed, hobbling forward. Lopen ran out to meet him, not\ncarrying an umbrella. A lot of people gave up on trying to stay dry during\nthe Weeping.\n“Lopen!” Kaladin said. “What?”\n“He’s waiting for you, gancho,” Lopen said, gesturing urgently. “The\nking himself.”\nKaladin limped more quickly toward his room. The door was open, and\nKaladin peeked in to find King Elhokar standing inside, looking about the\nsmall chamber. Moash guarded the door, and Taka—a former member of\nthe King’s Guard—stood nearer to the king."

Moash guarded the door, and Taka—a former member of\nthe King’s Guard—stood nearer to the king.\n“Your Majesty?” Kaladin asked.\n“Ah,” the king said, “bridgeman.” Elhokar’s cheeks were flushed. He’d\nbeen drinking, though he didn’t appear drunk. Kaladin understood. With\nDalinar and that disapproving glare of his gone for a time, it was probably\nnice to relax with a bottle.\nWhen Kaladin had first met the king, he’d thought Elhokar lacked\nregality. Now, oddly, he thought Elhokar did look like a king. It wasn’t that\nthe king had changed—the man still had his imperious features, with that\noverly large nose and condescending manner. The change was in Kaladin.\nThe things he’d once associated with kingship—honor, strength of arms,\nnobility—had been replaced with Elhokar’s less inspiring attributes.\n“This is really all that Dalinar assigns one of his officers?” Elhokar\nasked, gesturing around the room. “That man. He expects everyone to live\nwith his own austerity. It is as if he’s completely forgotten how to enjoy\nhimself.”\nKaladin looked to Moash, who shrugged, Shardplate clinking.\nThe king cleared his throat. “I was told you were too weak to make the\ntrip to see me. I see that might not be the case.”\n“I’m sorry, Your Majesty,” Kaladin said. “I’m not well, but I walk the\ncamp each day to rebuild my strength. I feared that my weakness and\nappearance might be offensive to the Throne.”\n“You’ve learned to speak politically, I see,” the king said, folding his\narms. “The truth is that my command is meaningless, even to a darkeyes. I\nno longer have authority in the eyes of men.”\nGreat. Here we go again.\nThe king waved curtly. “Out, you other two. I’d speak to this man\nalone.”\nMoash glanced at Kaladin, looking concerned, but Kaladin nodded.\nWith reluctance, Moash and Taka walked out, shutting the door, leaving\nthem to the light of a few dwindling spheres that the king set out. Soon,\nthose wouldn’t have any Stormlight to them at all—it had been too long\nwithout a highstorm. They’d need to break out candles and oil lamps.\n“How did you know,” the king asked him, “how to be a hero?”\n“Your Majesty?” Kaladin asked, sagging against his crutch.\n“A hero,” the king said, waving flippantly. “Everyone loves you,\nbridgeman. You saved Dalinar, you fought Shardbearers, you came back\nafter falling into the storming chasms! How do you do it? How do you\nknow?”\n“It’s really just luck, Your Majesty.”\n“No, no,” the king said. He began pacing. “It’s a pattern, though I can’t\nfigure it out. When I try to be strong, I make a fool of myself.

What do I have to do?”\nKaladin stepped back, shocked at the frankness. “Why are you asking\nme this, Your Majesty?”\n“Because you know the secret,” the king said, still pacing. “I’ve seen\nhow your men regard you; I’ve heard how people speak of you. You’re a\nhero, bridgeman.” He stopped, then walked up to Kaladin, taking him by\nthe arms. “Can you teach me?”\nKaladin regarded him, baffled.\n“I want to be a king like my father was,” Elhokar said. “I want to lead\nmen, and I want them to respect me.”\n“I don’t…” Kaladin swallowed. “I don’t know if that’s possible, Your\nMajesty.”\nElhokar narrowed his eyes at Kaladin. “So you do still speak your mind.\nEven after the trouble it brought you. Tell me. Do you think me a bad king,\nbridgeman?”\n“Yes.”\nThe king drew in a sharp breath, still holding Kaladin by the arms.\nI could do it right here, Kaladin realized. Strike the king down. Put\nDalinar on the throne. No hiding, no secrets, no cowardly assassination. A\nfight, him and me.\nThat seemed a more honest way to be about it. Sure, Kaladin would\nprobably be executed, but he found that didn’t bother him. Should he do it,\nfor the good of the kingdom?\nHe could imagine Dalinar’s anger. Dalinar’s disappointment. Death\ndidn’t bother Kaladin, but failing Dalinar… Storms.\nThe king let go and stalked away. “Well, I did ask,” he muttered to\nhimself. “I merely have to win you over as well. I will figure this out. I will\nbe a king to be remembered.”\n“Or you could do what is best for Alethkar,” Kaladin said, “and step\ndown.”\nThe king stopped in place. He turned on Kaladin, expression darkening.\n“Do not overstep yourself, bridgeman. Bah. I should never have come\nhere.”\n“I agree,” Kaladin said. He found this entire experience surreal.\nElhokar made to leave. He stopped at the door, not looking at Kaladin.\n“When you came, the shadows went away.”\n“The… shadows?”\n“I saw them in mirrors, in the corners of my eyes. I could swear I even\nheard them whispering, but you frightened them. I haven’t seen them since.\nThere’s something about you. Don’t try to deny it.” The king looked to him."

I do\nbelieve a few can think, however.\nFrom the Diagram, Book of the 2nd Desk\nDrawer: paragraph 14\nDalinar strode from the tent into a subtle rain, joined by Navani and\nShallan. The rain sounded softer out here than it had inside the tent, where\nthe drops had drummed upon the fabric.\nThey had marched farther inward all that morning, bringing them to the\nvery heart of the ruined plateaus. They were close now. So close, they had\nthe Parshendi’s full attention.\nIt was happening.\nAn attendant offered an umbrella to each person leaving the tent, but\nDalinar waved his away. If his men had to stand in this, he’d join them.\nHe’d be soaked by the end of this day anyway.\nHe strode through the ranks, following bridgemen in stormcoats who\nled the way with sapphire lanterns. It was still day, but the thick cloud cover\nrendered everything dim. He used blue light to identify himself. Roion and\nAladar, seeing that Dalinar had eschewed an umbrella, stepped out into the\nrain with him. Sebarial, of course, stayed underneath his.\nThey reached the edge of the mass of troops who had formed up in a\nlarge oval, facing outward. He knew his soldiers well enough to sense their\nanxiety. They stood too stiffly, with no shuffling or stretching. They were\nalso silent, not chattering to distract themselves—not even griping. The\nonly voices he heard were occasional barked orders as officers trimmed the\nlines. Dalinar soon saw what was causing the uneasiness.\nGlowing red eyes amassed on the next plateau.\nThey hadn’t glowed before. Red eyes yes, but not with those uncanny\nglows. In the dim light, the Parshendi bodies were indistinct, no more than\nshadows. The crimson eyes hovered like Taln’s Scar—like spheres in the\ndarkness, deeper in color than any ruby. Parshendi beards often bore bits of\ngemstone woven into them in patterns, but today those didn’t glow.\nToo long without a highstorm, Dalinar thought. Even the gems in Alethi"

You’re my only\ncontingency plan, Brightness.”\nShe nodded.\n“Dalinar,” Aladar said, sounding horrified as he watched the red eyes,\nwhich were forming into ordered ranks on the other side of the chasm, “tell\nme straight. When you brought us on this march, did you expect to find\nthese horrors?”\n“Yes.” It was true enough. He didn’t know what horrors he’d find, but\nhe had known that something was coming.\n“You came anyway?” Aladar demanded. “You hauled us all the way out\nonto these cursed plains, you let us be surrounded by monsters, to be\nslaughtered and—”\nDalinar grabbed Aladar by the front of the jacket and hauled him\nforward. The move caught the other man completely off guard, and he\nquieted, eyes widening.\n“Those are Voidbringers out there,” Dalinar hissed, rain dribbling down\nhis face. “They’ve returned. Yes, it is true. And we, Aladar, we have a\nchance to stop them. I don’t know if we can prevent another Desolation, but\nI’d do anything—including sacrificing myself and this entire army—to\nprotect Alethkar from those things. Do you understand?”\nAladar nodded, wide-eyed.\n“I hoped to get here before this happened,” Dalinar said, “but I didn’t.\nSo now we’re going to fight. And storm it, we’re going to destroy those\nthings. We’re going to stop them, and we’re going to hope that will stop this\nevil from spreading to the world’s parshmen, as my niece feared. If you\nsurvive this day, you’ll be known as one of the greatest men of our\ngeneration.”\nHe released Aladar, letting the highprince stumble back. “Go to your\nmen, Aladar. Go lead them. Be a champion.”\nAladar stared at Dalinar, mouth gaping. Then, he straightened. He\nslapped his arm to his chest, giving a salute as crisp as any Dalinar had\nseen. “It will be done, Brightlord,” Aladar said. “Highprince of War.”\nAladar barked to his attendants—including Mintez, the highlord that Aladar"

He thinks he’s going to be a storming hero.”\n“He now knows I was right about the need to unify Alethkar. He’s a\ngood soldier. Most of the highprinces are… or were, at some point.”\n“Pity you ended up with us two instead of them,” Sebarial said, nodding\ntoward Roion, who still stared out at the shifting red eyes. There were\nthousands now, still increasing as more Parshendi arrived. Scouts reported\nthat they were gathering on all three plateaus bordering the large one that\nthe Alethi occupied.\n“I’m useless in a battle,” Sebarial continued, “and Roion’s archers will\nbe wasted in this rain. Besides, he’s a coward.”\n“Roion is not a coward,” Dalinar said, laying a hand on the shorter\nhighprince’s arm. “He’s careful. That did not serve him well in the\nsquabbling over gemhearts, where men like Sadeas threw away lives in\nexchange for prestige. But out here, care is an attribute I’d choose over\nrecklessness.”\nRoion turned to Dalinar, blinking away water. “Is this really\nhappening?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “I want you with your men, Roion. They need to\nsee you. This is going to terrify them, but not you. You’re careful, in\ncontrol.”\n“Yeah,” Roion said. “Yes. You… you’re going to get us out of this,\nright?”\n“No, I’m not,” Dalinar said.\nRoion frowned.\n“We’re all going to get ourselves out of it together.”\nRoion nodded, and didn’t object. He saluted as Aladar had, if less\ncrisply, then headed toward his army on the northern flank, calling for his\naides to give him the numbers of his reserves.\n“Damnation,” Sebarial said, watching Roion go. “Damnation. What\nabout me? Where’s my impassioned speech?”\n“You,” Dalinar said, “are to go back to the command tent and not get in\nthe way.”\nSebarial laughed. “All right. That I can do.”\n“I want Teleb in command of your army,” Dalinar said. “And I’m\nsending both Serugiadis and Rust to join him. Your men will fight better\nagainst these things with a few Shardbearers at their head.” All three were\nmen who had been given Shards following Adolin’s dueling spree.\n“I’ll give the order that Teleb is to be obeyed.”\n“And Sebarial?” Dalinar asked.\n“Yes?”\n“If you have a mind for it, burn some prayers. I don’t know if anyone up\nthere is listening anymore, but it can’t hurt.” Dalinar turned toward the sea\nof red eyes. Why were they just standing there watching?\nSebarial hesitated. “Not as confident as you acted to the other two, eh?”"

Why were they just standing there watching?\nSebarial hesitated. “Not as confident as you acted to the other two, eh?”\nHe smiled, as if that comforted him, then sauntered off. What a strange\nman. Dalinar nodded to one of his aides, who went to give the orders to the\nthree Kholin Shardbearers, first picking Serugiadis—a lanky young man\nwhose sister Adolin had once courted—out of his command post along the\nranks, then running off to fetch Teleb and explain Dalinar’s orders.\nThat seen to, Dalinar stepped up to Navani. “I need to know you’re safe\nin the command tent. As safe as anyone can be.”\n“Then pretend I’m there,” she said.\n“But—”\n“You want my help with fabrials?” Navani said. “I can’t set up that sort\nof thing remotely, Dalinar.”\nHe ground his teeth, but what could he say? He was going to need every\nedge he could get. He looked out at the red eyes again.\n“Campfire tales come alive,” said Rock, the massive Horneater\nbridgeman. Dalinar had never seen that one guarding him or his sons; he\nwas a quartermaster, Dalinar believed. “These things should not be. Why do\nthey not move?”\n“I don’t know,” Dalinar said. “Send a few of your men to fetch Rlain. I\nwant to see if he can provide any explanations.” As two bridgemen ran off,\nDalinar turned to Navani. “Gather your scribes to write my words. I will\nspeak to the soldiers.”\nWithin moments, she had a pair of scribes—shivering as they stood\nunder umbrellas with pencils out to write—ready to record his words.\nThey’d send women down the lines and read his message to all the men.\nDalinar climbed into Gallant’s saddle to get a little height. He turned\ntoward the ranks of men nearby. “Yes,” he shouted over the sound of the\nrain, “these are Voidbringers. Yes, we’re going to fight them. I don’t know\nwhat they can do. I don’t know why they’ve returned. But we came here to\nstop them.\n“I know you’re scared, but you have heard of my visions in the\nhighstorms. In the warcamps, the lighteyes mocked me and dismissed what\nI’d seen as delusions.” He thrust his arm to the side, pointing at the sea of\nred eyes. “Well out there, you see proof that my visions were true! Out\nthere, you see what I have been told would come!”\nDalinar licked wet lips. He had given many battlefield speeches in his\nlife, but never had he said anything like what came to him now. “I,” he\nshouted, “have been sent by the Almighty himself to save this land from\nanother Desolation. I have seen what those things can do; I have lived lives\nbroken by the Voidbringers. I’ve seen kingdoms shattered, peoples ruined,\ntechnology forgotten. I’ve seen civilization itself brought to the trembling\nedge of collapse.\n“We will prevent this! Today you fight not for the wealth of a lighteyes,\nor even for the honor of your king. Today, you fight for the good of all men."

Today, you fight for the good of all men.\nYou will not fight alone! Trust in what I have seen, trust in my words. If\nthose things have returned, then so must the forces that once defeated them.\nWe will see miracles before this day is out, men! We merely have to be\nstrong enough to deserve them.”\nHe looked across a sea of hopeful eyes. Storms. Were those gloryspren\nabout his head, spinning like golden spheres in the rain? His scribes\nfinished writing down the short speech, then hurriedly started making\ncopies to send with runners. Dalinar watched them go, hoping to the\nTranquiline Halls that he hadn’t just lied to everyone.\nHis force seemed small in this darkness, surrounded by enemies. Soon,\nhe heard his own words being spoken in the distance, read out to the troops.\nDalinar remained seated, Shallan beside his horse, though Navani moved\noff to see to several of her contraptions.\nThe battle plan called for them to wait a little longer, and Dalinar was\ncontent to do so. With these chasms to cross, it was far better to be assaulted\nthan to assault. Perhaps the separate armies forming up would encourage\nthe Parshendi to start the battle by coming to him. Fortunately, the rain\nmeant no arrows. The bowstrings wouldn’t stand the dampness, nor would\nthe animal glue in the Parshendi recurve bows.\nThe Parshendi started singing.\nIt came in a sudden roar over the rains, startling his men, making them\nshy backward in a wave. The song wasn’t one Dalinar had ever heard\nduring plateau runs. This was more staccato, more frenetic. It rose all\naround, coming from the three surrounding plateaus, shouted like thrown\naxes at the Alethi in the center.\nDalinar shivered. Wind blew against him, stronger than was normal\nduring the Weeping. The gust drove raindrops against the side of his face.\nCold bit his skin.\n“Brightlord!”\nDalinar turned in his saddle, noting four bridgemen approaching along\nwith Rlain—he still had the man under guard at all times. He waved for his\nguards to part, allowing the Parshendi bridgeman to scramble up to his\nhorse.\n“That song!” Rlain said. “That song.”\n“What is it, man?”\n“It is death,” Rlain whispered. “Brightlord, I have never heard it before,\nbut the rhythm is one of destruction. Of power.”\nAcross the chasm, the Parshendi started to glow. Tiny lines of red\nsparked around their arms, blinking and shaking, like lightning.\n“What is that?” Shallan asked.\nDalinar narrowed his eyes, and another burst of wind washed over him.\n“You have to stop it,” Rlain said. “Please. Even if you have to kill them.\nDo not let them finish that song.”\nIt was the day of the countdown he had scribbled on the walls without\nknowing. The last day.\nDalinar made his decision based on instinct. He called for a messenger,\nand one jogged up—Teshav’s ward, a girl in her fifteenth year. “Pass the"

He called for a messenger,\nand one jogged up—Teshav’s ward, a girl in her fifteenth year. “Pass the\nword,” he commanded her. “Send to General Khal at the command tent, the\nbattalionlords, my son, Teleb, and the other highprinces. We’re changing\nstrategies.”\n“Brightlord?” the messenger asked. “What change?”\n“We attack. Now!”\n* * *\nKaladin stopped at the entrance to the lighteyed training grounds,\nrainwater streaming off his umbrella’s waxed cloth, surprised at what he\nsaw. In preparation for a storm, the ardents normally swept and shoveled\nthe sand into covered trenches at the edges of the ground to keep it from\nbeing blown away.\nHe had expected to see something similar during the Weeping. Instead,\nthey had left the sand out, but had then placed a short wooden barrier across\nthe gateway in. It plugged the front of the sparring grounds, allowing them\nto fill up with water. A small cascade of rainwater poured over the lip of the\nbarrier and into the roadway.\nKaladin regarded the small lake that now filled the courtyard, then\nsighed and reached down, undoing his laces, then pulling off both boots and\nsocks. When he stepped in, the cold water came up to his calves.\nSoft sand squished between his toes. What was the purpose of this? He\ncrossed the courtyard, crutch under his arm, boots joined by the laces and\nslung over his shoulder. The chill water numbed his wounded foot, which\nactually felt nice, though his leg still hurt with each step. It seemed that the\ntwo weeks of healing hadn’t done much for his wounds. His continued\ninsistence that he walk so much probably wasn’t helping.\nHe’d been spoiled by his abilities; a soldier with such a wound normally\nwould take months to recover. Without Stormlight, he’d just have to be\npatient and heal like everyone else.\nHe had expected to find the training grounds as abandoned as most of\nthe camp. Even the markets were relatively empty, people preferring to\nremain indoors during the Weeping. Here, however, he found the ardents\nlaughing and chatting as they sat in chairs in the raised arcades framing the\nsparring grounds. They sewed leather practice jerkins, cups of auburn wine\non tables at their sides. That area rose enough above the yard floor to stay\ndry.\nKaladin walked along, searching among them, but didn’t find Zahel. He\neven peeked in the man’s room, but it was empty.\n“Up above, bridgeman!” one of the ardents called. The bald woman\npointed toward the stairwell at the corner, where Kaladin had often sent\nguards to secure the roof when Adolin and Renarin practiced.\nKaladin waved in thanks, then hobbled over and awkwardly made his\nway up the steps. He had to close his umbrella to fit. Rain fell on his head\nas he poked it out of the opening in the roof, where the stairwell ended. The\nroof was made of tile set into hardened crem, and Zahel lay there in a\nhammock he’d strung between two poles. Kaladin thought they might be\nlightning rods, which didn’t strike him as safe.

A tarp hung above the\nhammock and kept Zahel almost dry.\nThe ardent swung gently, eyes closed, holding a square bottle of hard\nhonu, a type of lavis grain liquor. Kaladin inspected the rooftop, judging his\nability to cross those sloped tiles without toppling off and breaking his\nneck.\n“Ever been to the Purelake, bridgeman?” Zahel asked.\n“No,” Kaladin said. “One of my men talks about it, though.”\n“What have you heard?”\n“It’s an ocean that’s so shallow, you can wade across it.”\n“It’s ridiculously shallow,” Zahel said. “Like an endless bay, mere feet\ndeep. Warm water. Calm breezes. Reminds me of home. Not like this cold,\ndamp, godsforsaken place.”\n“So why aren’t you there instead of here?”\n“Because I can’t stand being reminded of home, idiot.”\nOh. “Why are we talking about it, then?”\n“Because you were wondering why we made our own little Purelake\ndown below.”\n“I was?”\n“Of course you were. Damnation boy. I know you well enough by now\nto know that questions bother you. You don’t think like a spearman.”\n“Spearmen can’t be curious?”\n“No. Because if they are, they either get killed or they end up showing\nsomeone in charge how smart they are. Then they get put somewhere more\nuseful.”\nKaladin raised an eyebrow, waiting for more explanation. Finally, he\nsighed, and asked, “Why have you blocked off the courtyard below?”\n“Why do you think?”\n“You are a really annoying person, Zahel. Do you realize that?”\n“Sure do.” He took a drink of his honu.\n“I assume,” Kaladin said, “that you blocked off the front of the practice\ngrounds so that the rain wouldn’t wash the sand away.”\n“Excellent deduction,” Zahel said. “Like fresh blue paint on a wall.”\n“Whatever that means. The problem is, why is it necessary to keep the\nsand in the courtyard? Why not just put it away, like you do before\nhighstorms?”\n“Did you know,” Zahel said, “that rains during the Weeping don’t drop\ncrem?”\n“I…” Did he know that? Did it matter?\n“Good thing too,” Zahel said, “or our entire camp here would end up\nclogged with the stuff. Anyway, rain like this, it’s great for washing.”\n“You’re telling me that you’ve turned the floor of the dueling grounds\ninto a bath?”\n“Sure did.”\n“You wash in that?”\n“Sure do. Not ourselves, of course.”\n“Then what?”\n“Sand.”\nKaladin frowned, then peered over the side, looking at the pool below.\n“Every day,” Zahel said, “we go in there and stir it up. The sand settles\nback down to the bottom, and all the yuck floats away, carried by the rain in\nlittle streams out of the camp. Did you ever consider that sand might need\nwashing?”\n“No, actually.”\n“Well it does. After a year’s worth of being kicked by stinky bridgeman"

After a year’s worth of being kicked by stinky bridgeman\nfeet and equally stinky—but far more refined—lighteyes feet, after a year\nof having people like me spill food on it, or having animals find their way\nin here to do business, the sand needs cleaning.”\n“Why are we talking about this?”\n“Because it’s important,” Zahel said, taking a drink. “Or something. I\ndon’t know. You came to me, kid, interrupting my vacation. That means you\nhave to listen to me blab.”\n“You’re supposed to say something profound.”\n“Did you miss the part about me being on vacation?”\nKaladin stood in the rain. “Do you know where the King’s Wit is?”\n“That fool, Dust? Not here, blessedly. Why?”\nKaladin needed someone to talk to, and had spent the better part of the\nday searching for Wit. He hadn’t found the man, though he had broken\ndown and bought some chouta from a lonely street vendor.\nIt had tasted good. That hadn’t helped his mood.\nSo, he’d given up on finding Wit and had come to Zahel instead. That\nappeared to have been a mistake. Kaladin sighed, turning back down the\nstairs.\n“What was it you wanted?” Zahel called to him. The man had cracked\nan eye, looking toward Kaladin.\n“Have you ever had to choose between two equally distasteful\nchoices?”\n“Every day I choose to keep breathing.”\n“I worry something awful is going to happen,” Kaladin said. “I can\nprevent it, but the awful thing… it might be best for everyone if it does\nhappen.”\n“Huh,” Zahel said.\n“No advice?” Kaladin asked.\n“Choose the option,” Zahel said, rearranging his pillow, “that makes it\neasiest for you to sleep at night.” The old ardent closed his eyes and settled\nback. “That’s what I wish I’d done.”\nKaladin continued down the steps. Below, he didn’t get out his\numbrella. He was already soaked anyway. Instead, he poked through the\nracks at the side of the practice grounds until he found a spear—real, not\npractice. Then he set down his crutch and hobbled out into the water.\nThere, he fell into a spearman’s stance and closed his eyes. Rain fell\naround him. It splattered in the water of the pool, sprinkled the rooftop,\npattered the streets outside. Kaladin felt drained, like his blood had been\nsucked from him. The gloom made him want to sit still.\nInstead, he started dancing with the rain. He went through spear forms,\ndoing his best to avoid putting weight on his wounded leg. He splashed in\nthe waters. He sought peace and purpose in the comfortable forms.\nHe didn’t find either.\nHis balance was off, and his leg screamed. The rain didn’t accompany\nhim; it just annoyed him. Worse, the wind didn’t blow. The air felt stale.\nKaladin stumbled over his own feet. He twisted the spear about him,\nthen dropped it clumsily. It spun away to splash into the pool. As he fetched\nit, he noticed the ardents watching him with looks ranging from befuddled\nto amused."

He’d\ncome here seeking solace, but he only grew more and more frustrated as he\ntried to practice.\nHow much of his ability with the spear had come from his powers? Was\nhe nothing without them?\nHe dropped the spear again after trying a simple twist and thrust. He\nreached for it, and found a rainspren sitting next to it in the water, looking\nupward, unblinking.\nHe snatched the spear with a growl, then looked up toward the sky. “He\ndeserves it!” he bellowed at those clouds.\nRain pelted him.\n“Give me a reason why he doesn’t!” Kaladin yelled, uncaring if the\nardents heard. “It might not be his fault, and he might be trying, but he’s\nstill failing.”\nSilence.\n“It’s right to remove the wounded limb,” Kaladin whispered. “This is\nwhat we have to do. To… To…”\nTo stay alive.\nWhere had those words come from?\nGotta do what you can to stay alive, son.

Gotta do\nwhat you can to stay alive…\nIt made a twisted, horrible kind of sense.\nIt hadn’t been Tien’s fault. Tien had tried. He’d still failed. So they’d\nkilled him.\nKaladin fell to his knees in the water. “Almighty, oh Almighty.”\nThe king…\nThe king was Dalinar’s Tien.\n* * *\n“Attack?” Adolin asked. “Are you certain that is what my father said?”\nThe young woman who had run the message nodded a rain-slicked\nhead, looking miserable in her slitted dress and runner’s sash. “You’re to\nstop that singing, if you can, Brightlord. Your father indicated it was\nimportant.”\nAdolin looked over his battalions, which held the southern flank. Just\nbeyond them, on one of the three plateaus that surrounded their army, the\nParshendi sang a horrible song. Sureblood danced, snorting.\n“I don’t like it either,” Adolin said softly, patting the horse on the neck.\nThat song put him on edge. And those threads of red light on their arms, in\ntheir hands. What were those?\n“Perel,” he said to one of his field commanders, “tell the men to get\nready for the mark. We’re going to charge across those bridges onto the\nsouthern plateau. Heavy infantry first, shortspears behind, longspears at the\nready in case we’re overrun. I want the men ready to form blocks on the\nother side until we’re sure where the Parshendi lines will fall.

His bridgeman guards for the day\nfollowed, a pair named Skar and Drehy.\n“You two going to sit out?” Adolin asked the bridgemen, his eyes\nforward. “Your captain doesn’t like you going into battle against\nParshendi.”\n“To Damnation with that!” Drehy said. “We’ll fight, sir. Those aren’t\nParshendi anyway. Not anymore.”\n“Good answer. They’ll advance once we start our assault. We need to\nhold the bridgehead for the rest of our army. Try to keep up with me, if you\ncan.” He glanced over his shoulder, waiting. Watching until…\nA large blue gemstone rose into the air, hoisted high on a distant pole\nnear the command tent.\n“Go!” Adolin kicked Sureblood into motion, thundering across the\nbridge and splashing through a pool on the other side. Rainspren wavered.\nHis two bridgemen followed at a run. Behind them, the heavy infantry in\nthick armor with hammers and axes—perfect for splitting Parshendi\ncarapace—surged into motion.\nThe bulk of the Parshendi continued their chanting. A smaller group\nbroke off, perhaps two thousand in number, and moved to intercept Adolin.\nHe growled, leaning low, Shardblade appearing in his hand. If they—\nA flash of light.\nThe world lurched, and Adolin found himself skidding on the ground,\nhis Shardplate grinding against stones. The armor absorbed the blow of the\nfall, but could do nothing for Adolin’s own shock. The world spun, and a\nspray of water spurted in through the slits in his helm, washing over his\nface.\nAs he came to rest, he heaved himself backward, up to his feet. He\nstumbled, clanking, thrashing about in case any Parshendi had gotten close.\nHe blinked away water inside his helm, then oriented himself on a change\nin the landscape in front of him. White amid the brown and grey. What was\nthat…\nHe finally blinked his eyes clear enough to get a good look. The\nwhiteness was a horse, fallen to the ground.\nAdolin screamed something raw, a sound that echoed in his helm. He\nignored the shouts of soldiers, the sound of rain, the sudden and unnatural\ncrack behind him. He ran to the body on the ground.

He started the process of\nsummoning his Blade and ran toward the fighting up ahead. Only moments\nhad passed, but already the Alethi lines were collapsing. Some infantry\nadvanced in clusters while others had hunkered down, stunned and\nconfused.\nAnother flash, accompanied by a cracking of the air. Lightning. Red\nlightning. It appeared in flashes from groups of Parshendi, then was gone in\nthe blink of an eye. It left a bright afterimage—glowing, forked—that\nbriefly obscured Adolin’s sight.\nAhead of him, men dropped, fried in their armor. Adolin shouted as he\ncharged, bellowing for the men to hold their lines.\nMore cracks sounded, but the strikes didn’t seem well aimed. They’d\nsometimes flash backward or would follow strange paths, rarely going\nstraight toward the Alethi. As he ran, he saw a blast come from a pair of\nParshendi, but it arced immediately down into the ground.\nThe Parshendi stared downward, befuddled. It was as if the lightning\nworked… well, like lightning from the sky, not following any sort of\npredictable path.\n“Charge them, you cremlings!” Adolin shouted, running through the\nmiddle of the soldiers. “Back into your lines! It’s just like advancing on\narchers! Keep your heads. Tighten up. If we break, we’re dead!”\nHe wasn’t certain how much of that they heard, but the image of him\nyelling, crashing into the line of Parshendi, did something. Shouts rose from\nofficers, lines re-formed.\nLightning flashed right at Adolin.\nThe sound was incredible, and the light. He stood in place, blinded.\nWhen it faded, he found himself completely unharmed. He looked down at\nthe armor, which was vibrating softly—a hum that rattled his skin in a\nstrangely comforting way. Nearby, another crack of lightning left a small\ngroup of Parshendi, but it didn’t blind him. His helm—which as always was\npartially translucent from the inside—darkened in a jagged streak, perfectly\noverlaying the lightning.\nAdolin grinned with clenched teeth, feeling a savage satisfaction as he\npushed into the Parshendi and swung his Shardblade through their necks.\nBy the old stories, the suit he wore had been created to fight these very\nmonsters.\nThough these Parshendi soldiers were sleeker and more ferocious-\nlooking than the ones he’d previously fought, their eyes burned just as\neasily. Then they dropped dead and something wiggled out of their chests—\nsmall red spren, like tiny lightning, that zipped into the air and vanished.\n“They can be killed!” one of the soldiers yelled nearby. “They can die!”\nOthers raised the call, passing it down the lines.

        "text": "“They can be killed!” one of the soldiers yelled nearby. “They can die!”\nOthers raised the call, passing it down the lines. Obvious though the\nrevelation seemed, it bolstered his troops, and they surged forward.\nThey can die.\n* * *\nShallan drew. Frantic.\nA map in ink. Each line precise. The large sheet, crafted at her order,\ncovered a wide board on the floor. It was the largest drawing she’d ever\ndone; she’d filled it in, section by section, as they traveled.\nShe listened with half an ear to the other scholars in the tent. They were\na distraction, but an important one.\nAnother line, rippled on the sides, forming a thin plateau. It was a copy\nof the one she’d drawn in seven other places on the map. The Plains were a\nfourfold radial pattern mirrored down the center of each quadrant, and so\nanything she drew in one quadrant she could repeat in the others, mirrored\nas appropriate. The eastern side was worn down, yes, so her map wouldn’t\nbe accurate in that area—but for cohesion, she needed to finish those parts.\nSo she could see the whole pattern.\n“Scout reporting in,” a messenger woman said, bursting into the tent,\nletting in a gust of the wet wind. This unexpected wind… it almost felt like\nthe wind before a highstorm.\n“What is the report?” Inadara asked. The severe woman was supposed\nto be a great scholar. She reminded Shallan of her father’s ardents. In the\ncorner of the room, Prince Renarin stood in his Shardplate, arms folded. He\nhad orders to protect them all, should the Parshendi try to break onto the\ncommand plateau.\n“The large center plateau is just as the parshman told us,” the scout said,\nbreathless. “It’s only one plateau over, to the east.” Lyn was a solid-looking\nwoman with long black hair and keen eyes. “It’s obviously inhabited,\nthough there doesn’t seem to be anyone there right now.”\n“And the plateaus surrounding it?” Inadara asked.\n“Shim and Felt are scouting those,” Lyn said. “Felt should be back soon.\nI can do a rough drawing of what I saw of the center plateau for you.”\n“Do it,” Inadara said. “We need to find that Oathgate.”\nShallan wiped a stray drop of water—fallen from Lyn’s coat—off her\nmap, then continued drawing. The army’s path from the warcamps inward\nhad allowed her to extrapolate and draw eight chains of plateaus, two each\n—mirrored—starting from the four “sides” of the Plains and working\ninward.\nShe had almost completed the last of the eight arms reaching toward the\ncenter. This close, earlier scout reports—and what Shallan had seen herself\n—allowed her to fill in everything around the center. Rlain’s explanations\nhad helped, but he hadn’t been able to draw out the center plateaus for her.\nHe’d never paid attention to their shapes, and Shallan needed precision.\nFortunately, earlier reports had almost been enough. She didn’t need\nmuch more. She was almost done.\n“What do you think?” Lyn asked.\n“Show it to Brightness Shallan.” Inadara sounded displeased, which\nseemed her normal state."

She was almost done.\n“What do you think?” Lyn asked.\n“Show it to Brightness Shallan.” Inadara sounded displeased, which\nseemed her normal state.\nShallan glanced over Lyn’s hastily sketched map, then nodded, turning\nback to her drawing. It would be better if she could see the center plateau\nherself, but the corner this woman had drawn gave Shallan an idea.\n“Not going to say anything?” Inadara asked.\n“Not done yet,” Shallan said, dipping her pen in the ink.\n“We have been given an order by the highprince himself to find the\nOathgate.”\n“I will.”\nSomething crashed outside, like distant lightning.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “Bad. Very bad.”\nInadara looked at Pattern, who dimpled the floor near Shallan. “I do not\nlike this thing. Spren should not speak. It may be of them, a Voidbringer.”\n“I am not a Voidspren,” Pattern said.\n“Brightness Shallan—”\n“He’s not a Voidspren,” Shallan said absently.\n“We should study it,” Inadara said. “How long did you say it has been\nfollowing you?”\nA heavy footstep sounded on the floor, Renarin stepping forward.\nShallan would have preferred to keep Pattern secret, but when the winds\nhad started picking up, he’d started buzzing loudly. There was no avoiding\nit now that he’d drawn the scholars’ attention. Renarin leaned down. He\nseemed fascinated by Pattern.\nHe wasn’t the only one. “It is likely involved,” Inadara said. “You\nshould not dismiss one of my theories so quickly. I still think it might be\nrelated to the Voidbringers.”\n“Know you nothing of Patterns, old human?” Pattern said, huffing.\nWhen had he picked up how to huff? “Voidbringers have no pattern.\nBesides, I have read of them in your lore. They speak of spindly arms like\nbone, and horrific faces. I should think, if you wish to find one, the mirror\nmight be a location where you can begin your search.”\nInadara recoiled. Then she stomped away, moving to chat with\nBrightness Velat and the ardent Isasik about their interpretation of Shallan’s\nmap.\nShallan smiled as she drew. “That was clever.”\n“I am trying to learn,” Pattern replied. “Insults in particular will be of\ngreat use to my people, as they are truths and lies combined in a quite\ninteresting manner.”\nThe pops continued outside. “What is that?” she asked softly, finishing\nanother plateau.\n“Stormspren,” Pattern said. “They are a variety of Voidspren. It is not\ngood. I feel something very dangerous brewing. Draw more quickly.”\n“The Oathgate must be in that center plateau somewhere,” Inadara said\nto her group of scholars.\n“We will never search the entire thing in time,” said one of the ardents,\na man who seemed to be constantly removing his spectacles and wiping\nthem down. He put them back on. “That plateau is by far the largest we’ve\nfound on the Plains.”\nIt was a problem. How to find the Oathgate? It could be anywhere.

        "text": "found on the Plains.”\nIt was a problem. How to find the Oathgate? It could be anywhere. No,\nShallan thought, drawing with precise motions, the old maps placed what\nJasnah thought was the Oathgate southwest of the city center.\nUnfortunately, she still didn’t have a scale for reference. The city was too\nancient, and all the maps were copies of copies of copies or re-creations\nfrom descriptions. She was certain by now that Stormseat hadn’t made up\nthe entire Shattered Plains—the city hadn’t been nearly so huge. Structures\nlike the warcamps had been outbuildings, or satellite cities.\nBut that was just a guess. She needed something concrete. Some sign.\nThe tent flaps opened again. It had grown cold outside. Was the rain\nharder than it had been?\n“Damnation!” the newcomer swore, a thin man in a scout’s uniform.\n“Have you seen what is happening out there? Why are we split across the\nplateaus? Wasn’t the plan to fight a defensive battle?”\n“Your report?” Inadara asked.\n“Get me a towel and some paper,” the scout said. “I rounded the\nsouthern side of the central plateau. I’ll draw what I saw… but Damnation!\nThey’re throwing lightning, Brightness. Throwing it! It’s insane. How do\nwe fight such things?”\nShallan finished the last plateau on her drawing. She settled back on her\nheels, lowering her pen. The Shattered Plains, drawn almost in their\nentirety. But what was she doing? What was the point?\n“We will make an expedition into the central plateau,” Inadara said.\n“Brightlord Renarin, we will need your protection. Perhaps in the Parshendi\ncity we will find the elderly or the workers, and we can protect them, as\nBrightlord Dalinar has instructed. They might know about the Oathgate. If\nnot, we can begin breaking into buildings and searching for clues.”\nToo slow, Shallan thought.\nThe newly arrived scout stepped up to Shallan’s large map. He leaned\nover, inspecting it as he dried himself off with a towel. Shallan gave him a\nglare. If he dripped water on this after all she’d done…\n“That’s wrong,” he said.\nWrong? Her art? Of course it wasn’t wrong. “Where?” she asked,\nexhausted.\n“That plateau there,” the man said, pointing. “It’s not long and thin, as\nyou drew it. It’s a perfect circle, with big gaps between it and the plateaus\non its east and west.”\n“That’s unlikely,” Shallan said. “If it were that way—” She blinked.\nIf it were that way, it wouldn’t match the pattern.\n* * *\n“Well then, find Brightness Shallan a squad of soldiers and do as she\nsays!” Dalinar said, turning and raising his arm against the wind.\nRenarin nodded. Blessedly, he’d agreed to put on his Plate for the battle,\nrather than continuing on with Bridge Four. Dalinar barely understood the\nlad these days… Storms. Dalinar had never known a man who could look\nawkward in Shardplate, but his son managed it. The sheet of wind-driven\nrain passed. Light from blue lanterns reflected from Renarin’s wet armor."

Light from blue lanterns reflected from Renarin’s wet armor.\n“Go,” Dalinar said. “Protect the scholars on their mission.”\n“I…” Renarin said. “Father, I don’t know…”\n“It wasn’t a request, Renarin!” Dalinar shouted. “Do as you’re told, or\ngive that storming Plate to someone who will!”\nThe boy stumbled back, then saluted with a metallic slap. Dalinar\npointed at Gaval, who barked orders, gathering a squad of soldiers. Renarin\nfollowed Gaval as the two of them moved off.\nStormfather. The sky had grown darker and darker. They’d need\nNavani’s fabrials soon. That wind came in bursts, blowing rain that was\nentirely too strong for the Weeping. “We have to interrupt that singing!”\nDalinar shouted against the rain, making his way to the edge of the plateau,\njoined by officers and messengers, including Rlain and several members of\nBridge Four. “Parshman. Is this storm their doing?”\n“I believe so, Brightlord Dalinar!”\nOn the other side of the chasm, Aladar’s army fought a desperate battle\nagainst the Parshendi. Red lightning came in bursts, but according to field\nreports, the Parshendi didn’t know how to control it. It could be very\ndangerous to those who stood close by, but was not the terrible weapon it\nhad first seemed.\nIn direct combat, unfortunately, these new Parshendi were another thing\nentirely. A group of them prowled close to the chasm, where they ripped\nthrough a squad of spearmen like a whitespine through a patch of ferns.\nThey fought with a ferocity beyond what the Parshendi had ever shown on\nthe plateau runs, and their weapons connected with flashes of red.\nIt was difficult to watch, but Dalinar’s place was not out there fighting.\nNot today.\n“Aladar’s eastern flank needs reinforcement,” Dalinar said. “What do\nwe have?”\n“Light infantry reserves,” General Khal said, wearing only his uniform.\nHis son wore his Shards, fighting with Roion’s army. “Fifteenth spear\ndivision from Sebarial’s army. But those were supposed to support\nBrightlord Adolin…”\n“He’ll survive without them. Get those men over here and see Aladar\nreinforced. Tell him to punch through to those Parshendi in the back,\nengage the ones singing at all costs. What’s Navani’s status?”\n“She is ready with the devices, Brightlord,” a messenger said. “She\nwants to know where she should begin.”\n“Roion’s flank,” Dalinar said immediately. He sensed a disaster brewing\nthere. Speeches were all well and good, but even with Khal’s son fighting\non that front, Roion’s troops were the worst he had. Teleb was supporting\nthem with some of Sebarial’s troops, who were surprisingly good. The man\nhimself was practically useless in a battle, but he knew how to hire the right\npeople—and that had always been his genius. Sebarial probably assumed\nthat Dalinar didn’t know that.\nHe’d kept many of Sebarial’s troops as a reserve up until now. With\nthem on the field, they’d committed almost every soldier they had."

With\nthem on the field, they’d committed almost every soldier they had.\nDalinar hiked back toward the command tent, passing Shallan, Inadara,\nsome bridgemen, and a squad of soldiers—Renarin included—crossing the\nplateau at a trot, heading out on their mission. They’d have to skirt across\nthe southern plateau, near the fighting, to get where they were going. Kelek\nspeed their way.\nDalinar himself pushed through the rain, soaked to the very bones,\nreading the battle through what he could see of the flanks. His force had the\nsize advantage, as anticipated. But now, this red lightning, this wind… The\nParshendi moved through the darkness and the gusts of wind with ease\nwhile the humans slipped, squinted, and were battered.\nStill, the Alethi were holding their own. The problem was that this was\nonly half of the Parshendi. If the other half attacked, his people would be in\nserious trouble—but they didn’t attack, so they must consider that singing\nto be important. They saw the wind they were creating as more damaging,\nmore deadly to the humans, than simply joining the battle.\nThat terrified him. What was coming would be worse.\n“I am sorry that you have to die this way.”\nDalinar stood still. Rain streamed down. He looked to the flock of\nmessengers, aides, bodyguards, and officers who attended him. “Who\nspoke?”\nThey looked at one another.\nWait… He recognized that voice, didn’t he? It was familiar to him.\nYes. He’d heard it many times. In his visions.\nIt was the voice of the Almighty.\n82. For Glory Lit\nThere is one you will watch. Though all of\nthem have some relevance to precognition,\nMoelach is one of the most powerful in this\nregard. His touch seeps into a soul as it breaks\napart from the body, creating manifestations\npowered by the spark of death itself. But no, this is\na distraction. Deviation. Kingship. We must\ndiscuss the nature of kingship.\nFrom the Diagram, Book of the 2nd Desk\nDrawer: paragraph 15\nKaladin limped up the switchbacks to the palace, his leg a knotted mass\nof pain. Almost falling as he reached the doors, he slumped against them,\ngasping, his crutch under one arm, spear in the other hand. As if he could do\nanything with that.\nHave… to get… to the king…\nHow would he get Elhokar away? Moash would be watching. Storms.\nThe assassination could happen any day… any hour now. Surely Dalinar\nwas already far enough from the warcamps.\nKeep. Moving.\nKaladin stumbled into the entryway. No guards at the doors. Bad sign.\nShould he have raised the alarm? There weren’t any soldiers in camp to\nhelp, and if he’d come in force, Graves and his men would know something\nwas wrong. Alone, Kaladin might be able to see the king. His best hope was\nto get Elhokar to safety quietly.\nFool, Kaladin thought to himself. You change your mind now? After all\nof this? What are you doing?"

He actually tried. The man was arrogant,\nperhaps incapable, but he tried. He was sincere.\nKaladin stopped, exhausted, leg screaming, and leaned against the wall.\nShouldn’t this be easier? Now that he’d made the decision, shouldn’t he be\nfocused, confident, energized? He felt none of that. He felt wrung out,\nconfused, and uncertain.\nHe pushed himself forward. Keep going. Almighty send that he wasn’t\ntoo late.\nWas he back to praying now?\nHe picked through darkened corridors. Shouldn’t there be more light?\nWith some difficulty, he reached the king’s upper rooms, with the\nconference chamber and its balcony to the side. Two men in Bridge Four\nuniforms guarded the door, but Kaladin didn’t recognize either of them.\nThey weren’t Bridge Four—they weren’t even members of the old King’s\nGuard. Storms.\nKaladin hobbled up to them, knowing he must look a sight, soaked\nthrough and through, limping on a leg that—he noticed—was trailing\nblood. He’d split the sutures on his wounds.\n“Stop,” said one of the men. The fellow had a chin so cleft, it looked\nlike he’d taken an axe to the face as a baby. He looked Kaladin up and\ndown. “You’re the one they call Stormblessed.”\n“You’re Graves’s men.”\nThe two looked at each other.\n“It’s all right,” Kaladin said. “I’m with you. Is Moash here?”\n“He’s off for the moment,” the soldier said. “Getting some sleep. It’s an\nimportant day.”\nI’m not too late, Kaladin thought. Luck was with him. “I want to be part\nof what you’re doing.”\n“It’s taken care of, bridgeman,” the guard said. “Go back to your\nbarrack and pretend nothing is happening.”\nKaladin leaned in close, as if to whisper something. The guard leaned\nforward.\nSo Kaladin dropped his crutch and slammed his spear up between the\nman’s legs. Kaladin immediately turned, spinning on his good leg and\ndragging the other one, whipping his spear toward the other man.\nThe man got his spear up to block, and tried to shout. “To arms! To—”\nKaladin slammed against him, knocking aside his spear. Kaladin\ndropped his own spear and grabbed the man by the neck with numb, wet\nfingers and cracked his head against the wall. Then he twisted and dropped,\nbringing his elbow down onto Cleft-chin’s head, driving it down into the\nfloor.\nBoth men fell still. Light-headed from the sudden exertion, Kaladin\nslammed himself back against the door. The world spun. At least he knew\nhe could still fight without Stormlight.\nHe found himself laughing, though it turned into a cough. Had he really\njust attacked those men? He was committed now. Storms, he didn’t even\nreally know why he was doing this. The king’s sincerity was part of it, but\nthat wasn’t the true reason, not deep down. He knew this was what he"

The thought of the king dying for no good reason made\nhim sick. It reminded him of what had been done to Tien.\nBut that wasn’t the full reason either. Storms, he wasn’t making any\nsense, not even to himself.\nNeither guard moved save for a few twitches. Kaladin coughed and\ncoughed, gasping for breath. No time for weakness. He reached up a\nclawlike hand and twisted the door handle, forcing it open. He half fell into\nthe room, then stumbled to his feet.\n“Your Majesty?” he called, propping himself up on his spear and\ndragging his bad leg. He reached the back of a couch and used it to pull\nhimself fully upright. Where was the—\nThe king lay on the couch, unmoving.\n* * *\nAdolin swept broadly with his Blade, maintaining perfect Windstance,\nthe sword’s point spraying water as he sheared through the neck of a\nParshendi soldier. Red lightning crackled from the corpse in a bright flare,\nconnecting the soldier to the ground as he died. Nearby Alethi were careful\nnot to step in puddles beside the corpse. They had learned the hard way that\nthis strange lightning could kill quickly via water.\nRaising his sword and charging, Adolin led a rush against the nearest\nParshendi group. Curse this storm and the winds that had brought it!\nFortunately, the darkness had been pushed back somewhat, as Navani had\nsent fabrials to bathe the battlefield in an extraordinarily even white light.\nAdolin and his team clashed again with the Parshendi. However, as\nsoon as he got among the enemy, he felt something tug on his left arm. A\nloop of rope? He jerked back. No rope could hold Shardplate. He growled\nand yanked the rope free of the hands holding it. Then he jerked as another\nrope looped his neck and pulled him backward.\nHe shouted, spinning and sweeping his Blade through the rope, severing\nit. Three more loops leaped from the darkness for him; the Parshendi had\nsent an entire team. Adolin turned to defensive sweeps, as he’d been trained\nby Zahel to resist a dedicated rope strike. They’d have strung other ropes\nacross the ground in front of him, expecting that he’d charge them… Yes,\nthere they were.\nAdolin backed away, slicing free the ropes that reached him.\nUnfortunately, his men had been depending on him to break the Parshendi\nline. As he backed away instead, the enemy pressed against the Alethi line\nin force. As always, they didn’t use traditional battle formations, instead\nattacking in squads and pairs. That was frightfully effective on this chaotic,\nrain-soaked battlefield, with cracks of lightning and bursts of wind.\nPerel, the field commander that he’d put in charge near the lights, called\nthe retreat for Adolin’s flank. Adolin let out a series of curses, cutting loose\none final rope and stepping backward, sword out in case the Parshendi\npursued.\nThey didn’t. Two figures, however, shadowed him as he joined the\nretreat.\n“Still alive, bridgemen?” Adolin asked."

From\nfarther back, the sound of that harsh chanting reached him between crashes\nof lightning and bursts of wind.\n“They keep sending teams to engage and distract me,” Adolin said.\n“They don’t intend to defeat me; they just want to keep me out of the\nbattle.”\n“They’ll have to really fight you sooner or later,” Drehy said, cutting off\nanother of the ropes. Drehy reached up and ran his hand over his bald head,\nwiping the rain off. “They can’t just leave a Shardbearer alone.”\n“Actually,” Adolin said, narrowing his eyes, listening to that chanting.\n“That’s exactly what they’re doing.”\nThrough sheets of windborne rain, Adolin jogged in a clanking run up to\nthe command position, near the lights. Perel—wrapped in a large stormcoat\n—stood there bellowing orders. He gave Adolin a quick salute.\n“Status?” Adolin asked.\n“Treading water, Brightlord.”\n“I have no idea what that means,” Adolin said.\n“Swimming term, sir,” Perel said. “We’re fighting back and forth, but\nwe’re not making any headway. We’re fairly evenly matched; each side is\nlooking for an edge. I’m most worried about those Parshendi reserves. They\nshould have committed those by now.”\n“The reserves?” Adolin asked, peering across the dim plateau. “You\nmean the singers.” To both right and left, Alethi troops engaged other\nParshendi units. Men shouted and screamed, weapons clashed, the familiar\ndeadly sounds of a battlefield.\n“Yes, sir,” Perel said. “They’re up against that rock formation at the\nmiddle of the plateau, singing their storming hearts out.”\nAdolin remembered that rock outcropping, looming in the dim light. It\nwas easily large enough for a battalion on top. “Could we climb it from\nbehind?”\n“In this rain, Brightlord?” Perel asked. “Not likely. Maybe you could,\nbut would you really want to go alone?”\nAdolin waited for the familiar eagerness to urge him forward, the desire\nto rush into the fight without concern for the consequences. He’d trained\nhimself to resist that urge, and was surprised to find it… gone. Nothing.\nHe frowned. He was tired. Was that the reason? He considered the\nsituation, thinking to the sound of rain on his helmet.\nWe need to get to those Parshendi at the back, he thought. Father wants\nthe reserves engaged, the song broken off…\nWhat had Shallan said about these inner plateaus? And the rock\nformations on them?\n“Gather me a battalion,” Adolin said. “A thousand men, heavy infantry.\nOnce I’ve been gone with them for a half hour, send the rest of the men in a\nfull assault against the Parshendi.

He spun about, still on\nthe central plateau between the three battlefields, startling the aides and\nattendants near him. “You told me you had been killed!”\nRain pelted his face. Were his ears playing tricks on him in this havoc of\nrain and shouting?\n“I am not the Almighty,” the voice said. Dalinar turned, searching\namong his startled companions. Four bridgemen in stormcoats stepped\nback, as if frightened. His captains watched the clouds unsteadily, holding\nhands on swords.\n“Did any of you hear that voice?” Dalinar asked.\nWomen and men alike shook heads.\n“Are you… hearing the Almighty?” asked one of the messenger women.\n“Yes.” It was the simplest answer, though he wasn’t sure what was\nhappening. He continued to cross the central plateau, intending to check on\nAdolin’s battlefront.\n“I am sorry,” the voice repeated. Unlike in the visions, Dalinar could\nfind no avatar speaking the words. They came out of nowhere. “You have\nstriven hard. But I can do nothing for you.”\n“Who are you?” Dalinar hissed.\n“I am the one left behind,” the voice said. It wasn’t exactly as he’d\nheard it in the visions; this voice had a depth to it. A density. “I am the\nsliver of Him that remains. I saw His corpse, saw Him die when Odium\nmurdered Him. And I… I fled. To continue as I always have. The piece of\nGod left in this world, the winds that men must feel.”\nWas he responding to Dalinar’s question, or speaking a mere\nmonologue? In the visions, Dalinar had originally assumed he was having\nconversations with this voice, only to find that its half of the seeming\ndialogue had been preset. He could not tell if this was the same or not.\nStorms… was he in the middle of a vision now? He froze in place,\nsuddenly imagining a horrible picture of himself, sprawled on the floor of\nthe palace, having imagined everything leading up to this battle in the rain.\nNo, he thought forcefully. I will not travel down that path. He had\nalways recognized when he was in a vision before; he had no reason to\nbelieve that had changed.\nThe reserves he’d ordered for Aladar trotted past, spearmen with points\ntoward the sky. That would be storming dangerous if real lightning came,\nbut they didn’t have much choice.\nDalinar waited for the voice to say more, but nothing happened. He\nproceeded, and soon approached Adolin’s plateau.\nWas that thunder?\nNo. Dalinar turned and picked out a horse galloping across the plateau\ntoward him, a messenger on its back. He held up a hand, interrupting a\ntactical report by Captain Javih.\n“Brightlord!” the messenger shouted. She reared the horse. “Brightlord\nTeleb has fallen! Highprince Roion has been routed. His lines are broken,\nhis remaining men surrounded by Parshendi! He’s trapped on the northern\nplateau!”"

The animal snorted, and Dalinar had to fight it\nbefore getting it to move. The pops of lightning in the distance had the\ncreature skittish.\nOnce pointed the right direction, he gave the horse its head, and it\ngalloped eagerly. Dalinar crossed the plateau in a rush, triage tents,\ncommand posts, and food stations passing in a blur. As he neared the\nnorthern plateau, he reined in the horse and scanned the area for Navani.\nNo sign of her, though he did see several large tarps laid on the ground\nhere—expansive squares of black cloth. She’d been at work. He called a\nquestion to an engineer, and she pointed, so Dalinar rode along the chasm in\nthat direction. He passed a succession of other tarps that had been arranged\non the stone.\nAcross the chasm to his left, men died with shouts and screams. He saw\nfirsthand how terribly Roion’s battle was progressing. The danger was\nmanifest in broken groups of men flying beleaguered banners, split into\nvulnerable small bunches by red-eyed enemies. The Alethi would fight on,\nbut with their line fragmenting, their prospects were grim.\nDalinar remembered fighting like that himself two months ago,\nsurrounded by a sea of enemies, without hope for salvation. Dalinar pushed\nhis horse faster, and soon spotted Navani. She stood beneath an umbrella\ndirecting a group of workers with another large tarp.\n“Navani!” Dalinar shouted, pulling his horse to a slippery stop across\nthe tarp from her. “I need a miracle!”\n“Working on it,” she shouted back.\n“No time for working. Execute your plan. Now.”\nHe was too distant to see her glare, but he felt it. Fortunately, she waved\nworkers away from her current tarp and began shouting orders to her\nengineers. The women ran up to the chasm, where a line of rocks was\narrayed. They were attached to ropes, Dalinar thought, though he wasn’t\nsure how this process worked. Navani shouted instructions.\nToo much time, Dalinar thought, anxious, watching across the chasm."

Navani shouted instructions.\nToo much time, Dalinar thought, anxious, watching across the chasm.\nHad they recovered Teleb’s Shards? He couldn’t spare grief for the man, not\nnow. They needed those Shards.\nBehind Dalinar, soldiers gathered. Roion’s archers, finest in the\nwarcamps, had been useless in this rain. The engineers backed up at a\nbarked order from Navani, and the workers shoved the line of some forty\nrocks into the chasm.\nAs the rocks fell, tarps jumped fifty feet into the air, pulled at the front\ncorners and centers. In an instant, a long line of improvised pavilions\nflanked the chasm.\n“Move!” Dalinar said, urging his horse between two of the pavilions.\n“Archers forward!”\nMen dashed into the protected areas under the tarps, some muttering at\nthe lack of any visible poles holding them in the air. Navani had pulled up\nonly the fronts, so the tarps slanted backward, away from the chasm. The\nrain streamed down in that direction. They also had sides, like tents, so only\nthe open faces were toward Roion’s battlefront.\nDalinar swung from the horse and handed the reins to a worker. He\njogged under one of the pavilions to where archers were forming ranks.\nNavani entered, carrying a large sack over her shoulder. She opened it to\nreveal a large glowing garnet suspended within a delicate wire lacework\nfabrial.\nShe fiddled with it for a moment, then stepped back.\n“We really should have had more time to test this,” she warned to\nDalinar, folding her arms. “Attractors are new inventions. I’m still half\nafraid this thing will suck the blood out of anyone who touches it.”\nIt didn’t. Instead, water quickly started to pool around the thing. Storms,\nit worked! The fabrial was pulling moisture from the air. Roion’s archers\nremoved bowstrings from protected pockets, bending bows and stringing\nthem at the orders of their lieutenants. Many of the men here were lighteyes\n—archery was seen as an acceptable Calling for a lighteyed man of modest\nmeans. Not everyone could be an officer.\nThe archers began loosing waves of arrows across the chasm into the\nParshendi who had surrounded Roion’s forces. “Good,” Dalinar said,\nwatching the arrows fly. “Very good.”\n“The rain and wind are still going to make aiming the arrows difficult,”\nNavani said. “And I don’t know how well the fabrials will work; with the\nfront of the pavilions open, humidity is going to flood in constantly. We\nmight run out of Stormlight after just a short time.”\n“It’s enough,” Dalinar said. The arrows made an almost immediate\ndifference, drawing Parshendi attention away from the beleaguered men. It\nwasn’t a maneuver to try unless you were desperate—the risk of hitting\nallies was great—but Roion’s archers proved deserving of their reputation.\nHe pulled Navani close with one arm. “You did well.” Then he called\nfor his horse—his horse, not that wild messenger beast—as he charged out"

Those archers would give him an opening. Hopefully it\nwasn’t too late for Roion.\n* * *\nNo! Kaladin thought, rounding the couch to the king’s side. Was he\ndead? There was no obvious wound.\nThe king shifted, then groaned in a lazy way and sat upright. Kaladin let\nout a deep breath. An empty wine bottle rested on the end table, and\nKaladin could smell the spilled wine now that he was closer.\n“Bridgeman?” Elhokar’s speech was slurred. “Have you come to gloat\nover me?”\n“Storms, Elhokar,” Kaladin said. “How much have you had?”\n“They all… they all talk about me,” Elhokar said, flopping down on the\ncouch. “My own guards… every one. Bad king, they say. Everyone hates\nhim, they say.”\nKaladin felt a chill. “They wanted you to drink, Elhokar. Makes their\njob easier.”\n“Huh?”\nStorms. The man was barely conscious.\n“Come on,” Kaladin said. “Assassins are coming for you. We’re getting\nout of here.”\n“Assassins?” Elhokar leapt to his feet, then wobbled. “He wears white. I\nknew he’d come… but then… he only cared about Dalinar… Not even the\nassassin thinks I’m worthy of the throne…”\nKaladin managed to get under Elhokar’s arm, holding his spear for\nsupport with one hand. The king slumped against him, and Kaladin’s leg\ncried out. “Please, Your Majesty,” Kaladin said, almost collapsing, “I need\nyou to try to walk.”\n“Assassins probably want you, bridgeman,” the king muttered. “You’re\nmore a leader than I am. I wish… wish you’d teach me…”\nThankfully, Elhokar then did support himself to an extent. It was a\nstruggle to walk the two of them to the doorway, where the guard’s body\nstill lay—\nBody? Where was the other one?\nKaladin twisted out of the king’s grip as a blur with a knife lunged at\nhim. By instinct, Kaladin snapped his spear haft back—bringing his hands\nup near to the head for a close-quarters fight—then thrust. The spearhead\nsank in deep into Cleft-chin’s stomach. The man grunted.\nBut he hadn’t been lunging for Kaladin.\nHe’d plunged his knife into the king’s side.\nCleft-chin flopped to the floor, falling off Kaladin’s spear and dropping\nhis knife. Elhokar reached—a stunned expression on his face—to his side.\nThe hand came away bloody. “I’m dead,” Elhokar whispered, regarding the\nblood.\nIn that moment, Kaladin’s pain and weakness seemed to fade. The\nmoment of panic was a moment of strength, and he used it to rip at\nElhokar’s clothing while kneeling on his good leg. The knife had glanced\noff a rib. The king was bleeding heavily, but it was a very survivable\nwound, with medical attention."

The king was bleeding heavily, but it was a very survivable\nwound, with medical attention.\n“Keep pressure on that,” Kaladin said, pushing a cut section of the\nking’s shirt against the wound, then placing the king’s hand over it. “We\nneed to get out of the palace. Find safety somewhere.” The dueling grounds,\nmaybe? The ardents could be relied upon, and they could fight too. But\nwould that be too obvious?\nWell, first they had to actually get out of the palace. Kaladin grabbed his\nspear and turned to lead the way out, but his leg nearly betrayed him. He\nmanaged to catch himself, but it left him gasping in pain, clinging to his\nspear to keep from falling.\nStorms. Was that pool of blood at his feet his? He’d ripped his sutures\nout, and then some.\n“I was wrong,” the king said. “We’re both dead.”\n“Fleet kept running,” Kaladin growled, getting back under Elhokar’s\narm.\n“What?”\n“He couldn’t win, but he kept running. And when the storm caught him,\nit didn’t matter that he’d died, because he’d run for all he had.”\n“Sure. All right.” The king sounded groggy, though Kaladin couldn’t tell\nif it was the alcohol or the blood loss.\n“We all die in the end, you see,” Kaladin said. The two of them walked\ndown the corridor, Kaladin leaning on his spear to keep them upright. “So I\nguess what truly matters is just how well you’ve run. And Elhokar, you’ve\nkept running since your father was killed, even if you screw up all the\nstorming time.”\n“Thank you?” the king said, drowsy.\nThey reached an intersection, and Kaladin decided on escaping through\nthe bowels of the palace complex, rather than the front gates. It was equally\nfast, but might not be the first place the plotters would look.\nThe palace was empty. Moash had done as he’d said, sending the\nservants away into hiding, using the precedent of the Assassin in White’s\nattack. It was a perfect plan.\n“Why?” the king whispered. “Shouldn’t you hate me?”\n“I don’t like you, Elhokar,” Kaladin said. “But that doesn’t mean it’s\nright to let you die.”\n“You said I should step down. Why, bridgeman? Why help me?”\nI don’t know.\nThey turned down a hallway, but only made it about halfway before the\nking stopped walking and slumped to the ground. Kaladin cursed, kneeling\nbeside Elhokar, checking his pulse and the wound.\nThis is the wine, Kaladin decided. That, plus the blood loss, left the king\ntoo light-headed.\nBad. Kaladin worked to rebind the wound as best he could, but then\nwhat? Try to pull the king out on a litter? Go for help, and risk leaving him\nalone?\n“Kaladin?”\nKaladin froze, still kneeling over the king.\n“Kaladin, what are you doing?” Moash’s voice demanded from behind.\n“We found the men at the door to the king’s room.

Darkness like dusk. Rainfall like hushed whispers.\nThis plateau was higher than most, so she could see Stormseat’s center\narrayed around her. Pillars with crem accreting at their bases, transforming\nthem to stalagmites. Buildings that had become mounds, overgrown with\nstone like snow covering a fallen log. In the darkness and rain, the ancient\ncity presented a sketch of skyline for the imagination to fill in.\nThis city hid beneath time’s own illusion.\nThe others followed her across the bridge. They’d skirted the fighting\non Aladar’s battlefront, slipping along the Alethi lines to attain this farther\nplateau. Getting up here had taken time, as the bridgemen had needed to\nlocate a usable landing. They’d had to climb a slope on the adjoining\nplateau and place their bridge there to get across the chasm.\n“How can you be sure this is the right place?” Renarin asked, clinking\ndown onto the plateau beside her. Shallan had opted for an umbrella, but\nRenarin stood in the rain, helm under his arm, letting the water stream down\nhis face. Didn’t he wear spectacles? She hadn’t seen them on him much\nlately.\n“It is the right place,” Shallan said, “because it’s deviant.”\n“That’s hardly a logical conclusion,” Inadara said, joining the two of\nthem as soldiers and bridgemen crossed to the empty plateau. “A portal of\nthis nature would be kept hidden; it would not be deviant.”\n“The Oathgates were not hidden,” Shallan said. “That is beside the\npoint, however. This plateau is a circle.”\n“Many are circular.”\n“Not this circular,” Shallan said, striding forward. Now that she was\nhere, she could see just how irregularly… well, regular the plateau was. “I\nwas looking for a dais on a plateau, but didn’t realize the scale of what I\nwas searching for. This entire plateau is the dais upon which the Oathgate\nsat.\n“Don’t you see? The other plateaus were created by some kind of\ndisaster—they are jagged, broken. This place is not.

On the old maps it was a raised\nsection, like a giant pedestal. When the Plains were broken, it remained this\nway.”\n“Yes…” Renarin said, nodding. “Imagine a plate with a circle etched\ninto the center… if a force shattered the plate, it might break along the\nalready weakened lines.”\n“Leaving you with a bunch of irregular pieces,” Shallan agreed, “and\none shaped like a circle.”\n“Perhaps,” Inadara said. “But I find it odd that something so tactically\nimportant would be exposed.”\n“The Oathgates were a symbol,” Shallan said, continuing to walk. “The\nVorin Right of Travel, given to all citizens of sufficient rank, is based on the\nHeralds’ declaration that all borders should be open. If you were going to\ncreate a symbol of that unity—a portal that connected all of the Silver\nKingdoms together—where would you put it? Hidden in a locked room? Or\non a stage that rose above the city? It was out here because they were proud\nof it.”\nThey continued through the blowing rain. There was a hallowed quality\nto this place, and honestly, that was part of how she knew she was right.\n“Mmmm,” Pattern said softly. “They are raising a storm.”\n“The Voidspren?” Shallan whispered.\n“The bonded ones. They craft a storm.”\nRight. Her task was urgent; she didn’t have time to stand around\nthinking. She was about to order the search begun, but paused as she\nnoticed Renarin staring westward, his eyes distant.\n“Prince Renarin?” she asked.\n“The wrong way,” he whispered. “The wind is blowing from the wrong\ndirection. West to east… Oh, Almighty above. It’s terrible.”\nShe followed his gaze, but could see nothing.\n“It’s actually real,” Renarin said. “The Everstorm.”\n“What are you talking about?” Shallan asked, feeling a chill at the tone\nof his voice.\n“I…” He looked to her and wiped the water from his eyes, gauntlet\nhanging from his waist. “I should be with my father. I should be able to\nfight. Only I’m useless.”\nGreat. He was creepy and whiny. “Well, your father ordered you to help\nme, so deal with your issues. Everyone, let’s search this place.”\n“What are we looking for, cousin?” asked Rock, one of the bridgemen.\nCousin, she thought. Cute. Because of the red hair. “I don’t know,” she\nsaid. “Anything strange, out of the ordinary.”\nThey split up and spread out across the plateau. Along with Inadara,\nShallan had a small group of ardents and scholars to help her, including one\nof Dalinar’s stormwardens. She sent teams of several scholars, one\nbridgeman, and one soldier each in different directions.\nRenarin and the majority of the bridgemen insisted on going with her.\nShe couldn’t complain about that—this was a war zone.

That would certainly have helped her\nvisualize.\nWhere would the portal be? Most likely at the center, so that was the\ndirection she went. There she found a large stone mound.\n“This is all?” Rock asked. “He is just more rock.”\n“That is exactly what I was hoping to find,” Shallan said. “Anything\nexposed to the air would have weathered away or become immured with\ncrem. If we’re to discover anything useful, it will have to be inside.”\n“Inside?” asked one of the bridgemen. “Inside what?”\n“The buildings,” Shallan said, feeling at the wall until she found a ripple\nin the back of the rock. She turned to Renarin. “Prince Renarin, would you\nkindly slay this rock for me?”\n* * *\nAdolin raised his sphere in the dark chamber, shining light on the wall.\nAfter so long outdoors in the Weeping, it felt strange not to have rain\ntapping against his helm. The musty air in this place was already growing\nhumid, and even with the shuffling of soldiers and men coughing, Adolin\nfelt like it was too silent. Within this rocky tomb, they may as well have\nbeen miles away from the battlefield just outside.\n“How did you know, sir?” asked Skar, the bridgeman. “How’d you\nguess that this rock mound would be hollow?”\n“Because a clever woman,” Adolin said, “once asked me to attack a\nboulder for her.”\nTogether, he and these men had circled to the other side of the large\nrock formation that the chanting Parshendi were using to guard their backs.\nWith a few twists of the Shardblade, Adolin had cut an entrance into the\nmound, which had proven to be hollow as he’d hoped.\nHe picked his way through the dusty chambers, passing bones and dried\ndebris that might once have been furniture. Presumably it had rotted away\nbefore the crem had finished sealing the building. Had it been a kind of\ncommunal dwelling, long ago? Or perhaps a market? It did have a lot of\nrooms; many doorways still bore rusted hinges that had once held doors.\nA thousand men moved through the building with him, holding lanterns\nthat carried large cut gems—five times bigger than broams, though even\nsome of those were starting to fail, as it had been so long since a highstorm.\nA thousand men was a large number to navigate through these eerie\nconfines. But, unless he was completely off, they should now be\napproaching the opposite wall—the one just behind the Parshendi. Some of\nhis men scouted nearby rooms, and came back with the confirmation. The\nbuilding ended here. Adolin now saw the outlines of windows, sealed up\nwith crem that had spilled in through gaps over the years, dribbling down\nthe wall and piling on the floor.\n“All right,” he called out to the company commanders and their\ncaptains. “Let’s gather everyone we can in this room here and the hall right\noutside. I’ll cut an exit hole. As soon as it’s open, we need to spill out and\nattack those singing Parshendi."

I’ll charge and try to draw attention. Everyone else move\nthrough and join the assault as quickly as you can manage.”\nThe men nodded. Adolin took a deep breath, then closed his faceplate\nand stepped up to the wall. They were on the second floor of the building,\nbut he estimated the buildup of crem outside would place that at about\nground level. Indeed, from outside he heard a faint sound. Humming,\nresonating through the wall.\nStorms, the Parshendi were right there. He summoned his Blade, waited\nuntil the company commanders passed the word back that their men were\nready, then hacked at the wall in several long ribbons. He sliced it the other\nway with sweeping blows, then slammed his Plate shoulder into it.\nThe wall broke down and fell out, stone blocks cascading away from\nhim. The rain returned in force. He was only a few feet off the ground, and\nhe eagerly pushed his way out onto the slick wet rocks. Just to his left,\nParshendi reserves stood in rows facing away from him, absorbed in their\nchanting. The clamor of battle was nearly inaudible here, all but drowned\nout by the spine-tingling sound of that inhuman singing.\nPerfect. The rain and chanting had covered the noise of the hole\nopening. He hacked open another hole as men spilled out from the first one,\nbearing lights. He began to open a third exit, but heard a shout. One of the\nParshendi had finally noticed him. She was female—with this new form of\ntheirs, that was more obvious than it had been before.\nHe charged the short distance to the Parshendi and launched himself\ninto their ranks, sweeping lethally with his Blade. Bodies fell dead with\nburned eyes. Five, then ten. His soldiers joined him, thrusting spears into\nthe Parshendi, cutting off their awful song.\nIt was shockingly easy. These Parshendi abandoned their song\nreluctantly, coming out of their trance disoriented and confused. Those who\nfought did so without coordination, and Adolin’s swift attack didn’t allow\ntime for them to summon their strange sparking energy.\nIt was like killing sleeping men. Adolin had done dirty work with his\nShards before. Damnation, any time you took the field with Plate and Blade\nagainst ordinary men, you did dirty work—slaughtering those who might as\nwell have been children with sticks. This was worse though. Often they’d\ncome to just before he killed them—blinking to consciousness, shaking\nthemselves awake, only to find themselves face-to-face with a full\nShardbearer in the rain, murdering their friends. Those looks of horror\nhaunted Adolin as he sent corpse after corpse to the ground.\nWhere was the Thrill that usually propelled him through this kind of\nbutchery? He needed it. Instead, he felt only nausea. Standing amid a field\nof the newly dead—the acrid smoke of burned-out eyes curling up through\nthe rain—he trembled and dropped his Blade in disgust. It vanished to mist.\nSomething crashed into him from behind."

A Shardblade smashed against his chest, spreading a glowing web of\ncracks across his breastplate. He deflected the next blow with his forearm\nand stepped back, taking a battle stance.\nShe stood before him, rain streaming from her armor. What had she\nnamed herself? Eshonai.\nInside his helm, Adolin grinned at the Shardbearer. This he could do. An\nhonest fight. He raised his hands, the Shardblade forming from mist as he\nswung upward and deflected her attack in a sweeping parry.\nThank you, he thought.\n* * *\nDalinar rode Gallant back across the bridge from Roion’s plateau,\nnursing a bloody wound at his side. Stupid. He should have seen that spear.\nHe’d been too focused on that red lightning and the quickly shifting\nParshendi fighting pairs.\nThe truth, Dalinar thought, sliding from his horse so a surgeon could\ninspect the wound, is that you’re an old man now. Perhaps not by the\nmeasuring of lifespans, as he was only in his fifties, but by the yardstick of\nsoldiers he was certainly old. Without Shardplate to assist, he was getting\nslow, getting weak. Killing was a young man’s game, if only because the\nold men fell first.\nThat cursed rain kept coming, so he escaped it under one of Navani’s\npavilions. The archers kept the Parshendi from following across the chasm\nto harry Roion’s beleaguered retreat. With the help of the bowmen, Dalinar\nhad successfully saved the highprince’s army, half of it at least—but they’d\nlost the entire northern plateau. Roion rode across to safety, followed by an\nexhausted Captain Khal on foot—General Khal’s son wore his own Plate\nand bore Teleb’s Blade, which he’d blessedly recovered from the corpse\nafter the other man had fallen.\nThey’d been forced to leave the body, and the Plate. Just as bad, the\nParshendi singing continued unabated. Despite the soldiers saved, this was\na terrible defeat.\nDalinar undid his breastplate and sat down with a grunt as the surgeon\nordered him a stool. He suffered the woman’s ministration, though he knew\nthe wound was not terrible. It was bad—any wound was bad on the\nbattlefield, particularly if it impaired the sword arm—but it wouldn’t kill\nhim.\n“Storms,” the surgeon said. “Highprince, you’re all scars under here.\nHow many times have you been wounded in the shoulder?”\n“Can’t remember.”\n“How can you still use your arm?”\n“Training and practice.”\n“That’s not how it works…” she whispered, eyes wide. “I mean…\nstorms…”\n“Just sew the thing up,” he said. “Yes, I’ll stay off the battlefield today.\nNo, I won’t stress it. Yes, I’ve heard all the lectures before.”\nHe shouldn’t have been out there in the first place. He’d told himself he\nwouldn’t ride into battle anymore. He was supposed to be a politician now,"

That water streamed off along two metal rods at the\nsides of the fabrial, spilling onto the ground, then running out of the tent\nand over the plateau’s edge.\nHe looked up at Navani grimly, expecting to be dressed down like a\nrecruit who had forgotten his whetstone. Instead, she took him by his good\nside, then pulled him close.\n“No reprimand?” Dalinar asked.\n“We’re at war,” she whispered. “And we’re losing, aren’t we?”\nDalinar glanced at the archers, who were running low on arrows. He\ndidn’t speak too loudly, lest they hear. “Yes.” The surgeon glanced at him,\nthen lowered her head and kept sewing.\n“You rode to battle when someone needed you,” Navani said. “You\nsaved the lives of a highprince and his soldiers. Why would you expect\nanger from me?”\n“Because you’re you.” He reached up with his good hand and ran his\nfingers through her hair.\n“Adolin has won his plateau,” Navani said. “The Parshendi there are\nscattered and routed. Aladar holds. Roion has failed, but we’re still evenly\nmatched. So how are we losing? I can sense that we are, from your face, but\nI don’t see it.”\n“An even match is a loss for us,” Dalinar said. He could feel it building.\nDistant, to the west. “If they complete that song, then as Rlain warned, that\nis the end.”\nThe surgeon finished as best she could, wrapping the wound and giving\nDalinar leave to replace his shirt and coat, which would hold the bandage\ntight. Once dressed, he climbed to his feet, intending to go to the command\ntent and get an update on the situation from General Khal. He was\ninterrupted as Roion burst into the pavilion.\n“Dalinar!” the tall, balding man rushed in, grabbing him by the arm.\nThe bad one. Dalinar winced. “It’s a storming bloodbath out there! We’re\ndead. Storms, we’re dead!”\nNearby archers shuffled, their arrows spent. A sea of red eyes gathered\non the plateau across the chasm, smoldering coals in the darkness.\nFor all that Dalinar wanted to slap Roion, that wasn’t the sort of thing\nyou did to a highprince, even a hysterical one. Instead, he towed Roion out\nof the pavilion. The rain—now a full-blown storm—felt icy as it washed\nover his soaked uniform.\n“Control yourself, Brightlord,” Dalinar said sternly. “Adolin has won\nhis plateau. Not all is as bad as it seems.”\n“It should not end this way,” the Almighty said."

Some progress. “Are you the Almighty?”\n“I said I am not, child of Honor.”\n“Then what are you?”\nI AM THAT WHICH BRINGS LIGHT AND DARKNESS. The voice\ntook on more of a rumbling, distant quality.\n“The Stormfather,” Dalinar said. “Are you a Herald?”\nNO.\n“Then are you a spren or a god?”\nBOTH.\n“What is the point of talking to me?” Dalinar shouted at the sky. “What\nis happening?”\nTHEY CALL FOR A STORM. MY OPPOSITE. DEADLY.\n“How do we stop it?”\nYOU DON’T.\n“There has to be a way!”\nI BRING YOU A STORM OF CLEANSING. IT WILL CARRY AWAY\nYOUR CORPSES. THIS IS ALL I CAN DO.\n“No! Don’t you dare abandon us!”\nYOU MAKE DEMANDS OF ME, YOUR GOD?\n“You aren’t my god. You were never my god! You are a shadow, a lie!”\nDistant thunder rumbled ominously. The rain beat harder against\nDalinar’s face.\nI AM CALLED. I MUST GO. A DAUGHTER DISOBEYS. YOU\nWILL SEE NO FURTHER VISIONS, CHILD OF HONOR. THIS IS THE\nEND.\nFAREWELL.\n“Stormfather!” Dalinar yelled. “There has to be a way! I will not die\nhere!”\nSilence. Not even thunder. People had gathered around Dalinar:\nsoldiers, scribes, messengers, Roion and Navani. Frightened people.\n“Don’t abandon us,” Dalinar said, voice trailing off. “Please…”\n* * *\nMoash stepped forward, his faceplate up, his face pained. “Kaladin?”\n“I had to make the choice that would let me sleep at night, Moash,”\nKaladin said wearily, standing before the unconscious form of the king.\nBlood pooled around Kaladin’s boot from the wounds he’d reopened. Light-\nheaded, he had to lean on his spear to keep on his feet.\n“You said he was trustworthy,” Graves said, turning toward Moash, his\nvoice ringing inside his Shardplate helm. “You promised me, Moash!”\n“Kaladin is trustworthy,” Moash said. It was just the three of them—\nfour, if you counted the king—standing in a lonely hallway of the palace.\nThis would be a sad place to die. A place away from the wind.\n“He’s just a little confused,” Moash said, stepping forward. “This will\nstill work. You didn’t tell anyone, right, Kal?”\nI recognize this hallway, Kaladin realized.

He’s practically dead already.”\nTrail of blood. Kaladin blinked bleary eyes. Of course. His thoughts\nwere coming slowly. He should have caught that.\nMoash stopped a few feet from Kaladin, just out of easy striking range\nwith the spear. “What are you going to do, Kal?” Moash demanded, looking\nat the spear pointed toward him. “Would you really attack a member of\nBridge Four?”\n“You left Bridge Four the moment you turned against our duty,”\nKaladin whispered.\n“And you’re different?”\n“No, I’m not,” Kaladin said, feeling a hollowness in his stomach. “But\nI’m trying to change that.”\nMoash took another step forward, but Kaladin pushed the spear point\nupward, toward Moash’s face. His friend hesitated, raising his gauntleted\nhands in a warding gesture.\nGraves moved forward, but Moash shooed him away, then turned to\nKaladin. “What do you think this will accomplish, Kal? If you get in our\nway, you’ll just get yourself killed, and the king will still be dead. You want\nme to know you don’t agree with this? Fine. You tried. Now you’re\novermatched, and there is no point in fighting. Put down the spear.”\nKaladin glanced over his shoulder. The king was still breathing.\nMoash’s armor clinked. Kaladin turned back, raising the spear again.\nStorms… his head was really throbbing now.\n“I mean it, Kal,” Moash said.\n“You’d attack me?” Kaladin said. “Your captain? Your friend?”\n“Don’t turn this around on me.”\n“Why not? Which is more important to you? Me or petty vengeance?”\n“He murdered them, Kaladin,” Moash snapped. “That sorry excuse for a\nking killed the only family I ever had.”\n“I know.”\n“Then why are you protecting him?”\n“It wasn’t his fault.”\n“That’s a load of—”\n“It wasn’t his fault,” Kaladin said. “But I’d be here even if it had been,\nMoash!

They had\nopened a building that hadn’t been entered, or even seen, for centuries.\nRenarin stepped back from the hole he’d made, giving Shallan a chance to\nstep forward. The air from inside smelled stale, musty.\nRenarin dismissed his Blade, and oddly, as he did so, he let out a\nrelieved sigh and relaxed against the outer wall of the building. Shallan\nmoved to enter, but the bridgemen slipped in front of her to check the\nbuilding’s safety first, raising sapphire lanterns.\nThe light revealed majesty.\nShallan’s breath caught in her throat. The large, circular room was a\nspace worthy of a palace or temple. A mosaic mural covered the wall and\nfloor with majestic images and dazzling color. Knights in armor stood\nbefore swirling skies of red and blue. People from all walks of life were\ndepicted in all manner of settings, each crafted from vivid colors of every\nkind of stone—a masterwork that brought the whole world into one room.\nWorried she’d damage the portal somehow, she’d placed Renarin’s cuts\nnear a ripple that she had hoped indicated a doorway, and it seemed that\nshe’d been correct. She entered through the hole and walked a curving path\nthrough the circular chamber, silently counting the divisions in the floor\nmural. There were ten main ones, just as there had been ten orders of\nknights, ten kingdoms, ten peoples. And then—between the segments\nrepresenting the first and tenth kingdoms—was a narrower eleventh section.\nIt depicted a tall tower. Urithiru.\nShe’d found it, the portal. And this artwork! Such beauty. It was\nbreathtaking.\nNo, there wasn’t time to admire art right now. The large floor mosaic\nswirled around the center, but the swords of each knight pointed toward the\nsame area of the wall, so Shallan walked in that direction. Everything in\nhere seemed perfectly preserved, even the lamps on the walls, which\nappeared to still hold dun gemstones.\nOn the wall, she found a metal disc set into the stone. Was this steel? It\nhadn’t rusted or even tarnished despite its long abandonment.\n“It’s coming,” Renarin announced from the other side of the room, his\nquiet voice echoing across the domed chamber.

Storms, that boy was\ndisturbing, particularly when accompanied by a howling storm and the\nsound of rain pelting the plateau outside.\nBrightness Inadara and several scholars arrived. Stepping into the\nchamber, they gasped and then began talking over one another as they\nrushed to examine the mural.\nShallan studied the strange disc set into the wall. It was shaped like a\nten-pointed star and had a thin slot directly in the center. The Radiants\ncould operate this place, she thought. And what did the Radiants have that\nnobody else did? Many things, but the shape of that slot in the metal gave\nher a pretty good guess why only they could make the Oathgate work.\n“Renarin, get over here,” Shallan said.\nThe boy clomped in her direction.\n“Shallan,” Pattern said warningly. “Time is very short. They have\nsummoned the Everstorm. And… and there’s something else, coming from\nthe other direction. A highstorm?”\n“It’s the Weeping,” Shallan said, looking to Pattern, who dimpled the\nwall just beside the steel disc. “No highstorms.”\n“One is coming anyway. Shallan, they’re going to hit together. Two\nstorms coming, one from each direction. They will crash into each other\nright here.”\n“I don’t suppose they’ll just, you know, cancel each other out?”\n“They will feed each other,” Pattern said. “It will be like two waves\nhitting with their peaks coinciding… it will create a storm like none the\nworld has ever seen. Stone will shatter, plateaus themselves might collapse.\nIt’s going to be bad. Very, very bad.”\nShallan looked to Inadara, who had walked up beside her. “Thoughts?”\n“I don’t know what to think, Brightness,” Inadara said. “You were right\nabout this place. I… I no longer trust myself to judge what is correct and\nwhat is false.”\n“We need to move the armies to this plateau,” Shallan said. “Even if\nthey defeat the Parshendi, they’re doomed unless we can make this portal\nwork.”\n“It doesn’t look like a portal at all,” Inadara said. “What will it do?\nOpen a doorway in the wall?”\n“I don’t know,” Shallan said, looking to Renarin. “Summon your\nShardblade.”\nHe did so, wincing as it appeared. Shallan pointed at the slot like a\nkeyhole in the wall—acting on a hunch. “See if you can scratch that metal\nwith your Blade. Be very careful. We don’t want to ruin the Oathgate, in\ncase I’m wrong.”\nRenarin stepped up and carefully—using his hand to pinch the weapon\nfrom above—placed the tip of the blade on the metal around the keyhole.\nHe grunted as the Blade wouldn’t cut. He tried a little harder, and the metal\nresisted the Blade.\n“Made of the same stuff!” Shallan said, growing excited. “And that slot\nis shaped like it might fit a Blade. Try sliding the weapon in, very slowly.”"

It was working! He got the weapon placed, and they turned\naround, looking over the chamber. Nothing appeared to have changed.\n“Did that do anything?” Renarin asked.\n“It has to have,” Shallan said. They’d unlocked a door, perhaps. But\nhow to turn the equivalent of the doorknob?\n“We need Highlady Navani to help,” Shallan said. “More importantly,\nwe need to bring everyone here. Go, soldiers, bridgemen! Run and tell\nDalinar to gather his armies on this plateau. Tell him that if he doesn’t, they\nare doomed. The rest of you scholars, we’re going to put our heads together\nand figure out how this storming thing works.”\n* * *\nAdolin danced through the storm, trading blows with Eshonai. She was\ngood, though she didn’t use stances he recognized. She dodged back and\nforth, feeling him out with her Blade, bursting through the storm like a\ncrackling thunderbolt.\nAdolin kept after her, sweeping with his Shardblade, forcing her away.\nA duel. He could win a duel. Even in the middle of a storm, even against a\nmonster, this was something he could do. He backed her away across the\nbattlefield, closer to where his armies had crossed the chasm to join this\nbattle.\nShe was difficult to maneuver. He had only met this Eshonai twice, but\nhe felt he knew her through the way she fought. He sensed her eagerness for\nblood. Her eagerness to kill. The Thrill. He did not feel it himself. He\nsensed it in her.\nAround him, Parshendi fled or fought in pockets as his men harried\nthem. He passed a Parshendi, forced to the ground by soldiers, being gutted\nin the rain as he tried to crawl away. Water and blood splashed on the\nplateau, frantic yells sounding amid the thunder.\nThunder. Distant thunder from the west. Adolin glanced in that\ndirection, and nearly lost his concentration. He could see it building, wind\nand rain spinning in a gigantic pillar, flashing red.\nEshonai swung for him, and Adolin turned back, blocking the blow with\nhis forearm. That section of his Plate was getting weak, the cracks leaking\nStormlight. He stepped into the blow and swung his own Blade, one-\nhanded, into Eshonai’s side. He was rewarded by a grunt. She didn’t fold,\nthough. She didn’t even step back. She raised her Blade and smashed it\ndown against his forearm yet again.\nThe Plate there exploded in a flash of light and molten metal. Storms.\nAdolin was forced to pull the arm back and release the gauntlet—now too\nheavy, without the connecting Plate to help it—letting it drop off his hand.\nThe wind that blew against his exposed skin was startlingly powerful.\nA little more, Adolin thought, not backing away despite the lost section"

He grabbed his Shardblade in two hands—one metal, the other\nflesh—and battered forward with a series of strikes. He transitioned out of\nWindstance. No sweeping majesty for him. He needed the frantic fury of\nFlamestance. Not just for the power, but because of what he needed to\nconvey to Eshonai.\nEshonai growled, forced backward. “Your day has ended, destroyer,”\nshe said inside her helm. “Today, your brutality turns against you. Today,\nextinction turns from us to you.”\nA little more.\nAdolin pressed her with a burst of swordplay, then he flagged,\npresenting her with an opening. She took it immediately, swinging for his\nhelm, which leaked from an earlier blow. Yes, she was fully caught up in\nthe Thrill. That lent her energy and strength, but it drove her to\nrecklessness. To ignore her surroundings.\nAdolin took the hit to the head and stumbled. Eshonai laughed with glee\nand moved to swing again.\nAdolin lunged forward and slammed his shoulder and head into her\nchest. His helm exploded from the force of it, but his gambit succeeded.\nEshonai had not noticed how close they were to the chasm.\nHis shove threw her over the plateau’s edge. He felt Eshonai’s panic,\nheard her shout, as she was dropped into the open blackness.\nUnfortunately, the exploding helm left Adolin momentarily blinded. He\nstumbled, and when he put a foot down, it landed only on empty air. He\nlurched, then fell toward the void of the chasm.\nFor a timeless moment, all he felt was panic and fright, a frozen eternity\nbefore he realized he wasn’t falling. His vision cleared, and he looked down\ninto the maw before him, rain falling in curtains all around. Then he looked\nback over his shoulder.\nTo where two bridgemen had grabbed hold of the steel link skirt of his\nPlate and were struggling to hold him back from the brink. Grunting, they\nclung to the slick metal, holding tight with feet thrust against stones to keep\nfrom being pulled off with him.\nOther soldiers materialized, rushing to help. Hands grabbed Adolin\naround the waist and shoulders, and together they hauled him back from the\nbrink of the void—to the point that he was able to get his balance again and\nstumble away from the chasm.\nSoldiers cheered, and Adolin let out an exhausted laugh. He turned to\nthe bridgemen, Skar and Drehy. “I guess,” Adolin said, “I don’t need to\nwonder if you two can keep up with me or not.”\n“This was nothing,” Skar said.\n“Yeah,” Drehy added. “Lifting fat lighteyes is easy. You should try a\nbridge sometime.”\nAdolin grinned, then wiped water from his face with his exposed hand.\n“See if you can find a chunk of my helm or forearm piece. Regrowing the\narmor will go faster if we’ve got a seed. Collect my gauntlet too, if you\nwould.”"

That… that\ndid not seem like a good sign.\nHe needed a better grasp on what was happening in the rest of the army.\nHe jogged across the bridge to the central plateau. Where was his father?\nWhat was happening on Aladar’s and Roion’s fronts? Had Shallan returned\nfrom her expedition?\nEverything seemed chaotic here on the central plateau. The rising winds\ntore at tents, and some of them had collapsed. People ran this way and that.\nAdolin spotted a figure in a thick cloak, striding purposefully through the\nrain. That person looked like he knew what he was doing. Adolin caught his\narm as he passed.\n“Where’s my father?” he asked. “What orders are you delivering?”\nThe hood of the cloak fell down and the man turned to regard Adolin\nwith eyes that were slightly too large, too rounded. A bald head. Filmy,\nloose clothing beneath the cloak.\nThe Assassin in White.\n* * *\nMoash stepped forward, but did not summon his Shardblade.\nKaladin struck with his spear, but it was futile. He’d used what strength\nhe had to merely remain upright. His spear glanced off Moash’s helm, and\nthe former bridgeman slapped a fist down on the weapon, shattering the\nwood.\nKaladin lurched to a stop, but Moash wasn’t done. He stepped forward\nand slammed an armored fist into Kaladin’s gut.\nKaladin gasped, folding as things broke inside of him. Ribs snapped like\ntwigs before that impossibly strong fist. Kaladin coughed, spraying blood\nacross Moash’s armor, then groaned as his friend stepped back, removing\nhis fist.\nKaladin collapsed to the cold stone floor, everything shaking. His eyes\nfelt like they’d pop from his face, and he curled around his broken chest,\ntrembling.\n“Storms.” Moash’s voice was distant. “That was a harder blow than I\nintended.”\n“You did what you had to.” Graves.\nOh… Stormfather… the pain…\n“Now what?” Moash.\n“We end this. Kill the king with a Shardblade. It will still look like the\nassassin, hopefully. Those blood trails are frustrating. They might make\npeople ask questions. Here, let me cut down these boards, so it looks like he\ncame in through the wall, like last time.”\nCold air. Rain.\nYelling? Very distant? He knew that voice…\n“Syl?” Kaladin whispered, blood on his lips. “Syl?”\nNothing.\n“I ran until… until I couldn’t any longer,” Kaladin whispered. “End\nof… the race.”\nLife before death.\n“I will do it.” Graves. “I will bear this burden.”\n“It is my right!” Moash said.\nHe blinked, eyes resting on the king’s unconscious body just beside\nhim. Still breathing.\nI will protect those who cannot protect themselves.\nIt made sense, now, why he’d had to make this choice. Kaladin rolled to\nhis knees. Graves and Moash were arguing."

That was selfishness.\nStraining, agonized, Kaladin raised one foot. The good foot. Coughing\nblood, he shoved himself upward and stumbled to his feet between Elhokar\nand the assassins. Fingers trembling, he felt at his belt, and—after two tries\n—got his side knife out. He squeezed out tears of pain, and through blurry\nvision, saw the two Shardbearers looking at him.\nMoash slowly raised his faceplate, revealing a stunned expression.\n“Stormfather… Kal, how are you standing?”\nIt made sense now.\nThat was why he’d come back.

We missed it completely! We focused on making\ncertain you were separated from Dalinar, and not on what our actions might\npush you to become!”\nMoash looked from Graves back at Kaladin.

Two highstorms.”\n“How could there be two?” Navani asked. She wore a stout cloak but\nwas soaked clear through anyway, her umbrella having blown away long\nago. Roion walked on Dalinar’s other side, his beard and mustache limp\nwith water.\n“I don’t know, Brightness,” Peet said. “But that’s what she said. A\nhighstorm and something else. She called it an Everstorm. She expects\nthey’re going to collide right here.”\nDalinar considered, frowning. The command tent was just ahead. Inside,\nhe’d talk to his field commanders, and—\nThe command tent shuddered, then ripped free in a burst of wind.\nTrailing ropes and spikes, it blew right past Dalinar, almost close enough to\ntouch. Dalinar cursed as the light of a dozen lanterns—once contained in\nthe tent—spilled onto the plateau. Scribes and soldiers scrambled, trying to\ngrab maps and sheets of paper as rain and wind claimed them.\n“Storm it!” Dalinar said, turning his back to the powerful wind. “I need\nan update!”\n“Sir!” Commander Cael, head of the field command, jogged over, his\nwife—Apara—following. Cael’s clothing was mostly dry, though that was\nquickly changing. “Aladar has won his plateau! Apara was just composing\nyou a message.”\n“Really?” Almighty bless that man. He’d done it.\n“Yes, sir,” Cael said. He had to shout against the wind and rain.\n“Highprince Aladar said the singing Parshendi went right down, letting him\nslaughter them. The rest broke and fled. Even with Roion’s plateau fallen,\nwe’ve won the day!”\n“Doesn’t feel like it,” Dalinar shouted back. Just minutes ago, the\nrainfall had been light. The situation was degrading quickly. “Send orders\nimmediately to Aladar, my son, and General Khal. There’s a plateau just to\nthe southeast, perfectly round. I want all of our forces to move there to\nbrace for an oncoming storm.”\n“Yes, sir!” Cael said with a salute, fist to coat. With the other hand,\nhowever, he pointed over Dalinar’s shoulder. “Sir, have you seen that?”\nHe turned, looking back toward the west. Red light flashed, lightning\ncoursing down in repeated blasts. The sky itself seemed to spasm as\nsomething built there, swirling in an enormous storm cell that was rapidly\nexpanding outward.\n“Almighty above…” Navani whispered.\nNearby another tent shook, its stakes coming undone. “Leave the tents,\nCael,” Dalinar said. “Get everyone moving. Now. Navani, go to Brightness\nShallan. Help her if you can.”\nThe officer leaped away and began shouting orders. Navani went with\nhim, vanishing into the night, and a squad of soldiers chased after her to\nprovide protection.\n“And me, Dalinar?” Roion asked.\n“We’ll need you to take command of your men and lead them to safety,”\nDalinar said. “If such a thing can be found.”\nThat tent nearby shook again.

It didn’t seem to be\nmoving along with the wind. And was that… shouting?\nAdolin crashed through the tent’s fabric and skidded along the stones on\nhis back, his armor leaking Light.\n“Adolin!” Dalinar shouted, dashing to his son.\nThe young man was missing several segments of his armor. He looked\nup with gritted teeth, blood streaming from his nose. He said something, but\nit was lost to the wind. No helm, no left vambrace, the breastplate cracked\njust short of shattering, his right leg exposed. Who could have done such a\nthing to a Shardbearer?\nDalinar knew the answer immediately. He cradled Adolin, but looked up\npast the collapsed tent. It whipped in the storm and tore away as a man\nstrode past it, glowing with spinning trails of Stormlight. Those foreign\nfeatures, clothing all of white plastered to his body by the rain, a bowed,\nhairless head, shadows hiding eyes that glowed with Stormlight.\nGavilar’s murderer. Szeth, the Assassin in White.\n* * *\nShallan worked through the inscriptions on the wall of the round\nchamber, frantically searching for some way to make the Oathgate function.\nThis had to work. It had to.\n“This is all in the Dawnchant,” Inadara said. “I can’t make sense of any\nof it.”\nThe Knights Radiant are the key.\nShouldn’t Renarin’s sword have been enough? “What’s the pattern?”\nshe whispered.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “Perhaps you cannot see it because you are too\nclose? Like the Shattered Plains?”\nShallan hesitated, then stood and walked to the center of the room,\nwhere the depictions of the Knights Radiant and their kingdoms met at a\ncentral point.\n“Brightlord Renarin?” Inadara asked. “Is something wrong?” The young\nprince had fallen to his knees and was huddled next to the wall.\n“I can see it,” Renarin answered feverishly, his voice echoing in the\nchamber. Ardents who had been studying part of the murals looked up at\nhim. “I can see the future itself. Why? Why, Almighty? Why have you\ncursed me so?” He screamed a pleading cry, then stood and cracked\nsomething against the wall. A rock? Where had he gotten it? He gripped the\nthing in a gauntleted hand and began to write.\nShocked, Shallan took a step toward him. A sequence of numbers?\nAll zeros.\n“It’s come,” Renarin whispered. “It’s come, it’s come, it’s come. We’re\ndead. We’re dead. We’re dead…”\n* * *\nDalinar knelt beneath a fracturing sky, holding his son. Rainwater\nwashed the blood from Adolin’s face, and the boy blinked, dazed from his\nthrashing.\n“Father…” Adolin said.\nThe assassin stepped forward quietly, with no apparent urgency.

Don’t follow.”\n“Father!” Adolin said, his eyes focusing.\nDalinar stood up. Adolin lurched over onto all fours and tried to get to\nhis feet, but the assassin had broken one of Adolin’s greaves, which made it\nalmost impossible to rise. The boy slipped back into the pooling water.\n“You’ve been taught well, Adolin,” Dalinar said, eyes on that assassin.\n“You’re a better man than I am. I was always a tyrant who had to learn to be\nsomething else. But you, you’ve been a good man from the start. Lead\nthem, Adolin. Unite them.”\n“Father!”\nDalinar walked away from Adolin. Nearby, scribes and attendants,\ncaptains and enlisted men all shouted and scrambled, trying to find order in\nthe chaos of the storm. They followed Dalinar’s order to evacuate, and most\nhad yet to notice the figure in white.\nThe assassin stopped ten paces from Dalinar. Roion, pale-faced and\nstammering, backed away from the two of them and began shouting.\n“Assassin! Assassin!”\nThe rainfall was actually letting up a little. That didn’t bring Dalinar\nmuch hope; not with that red lightning on the horizon. Was that… a\nstormwall building at the front of the new storm? His efforts to disrupt the\nParshendi had fallen short.\nThe Shin man didn’t strike. He stood opposite Dalinar, motionless,\nexpressionless, water dripping down his face. Unnaturally calm.\nDalinar was far taller and broader. This small man in white, with his\npale skin, seemed almost a youth, a stripling by comparison.\nBehind him, Roion’s cries were lost in the confusion. However, Bridge\nFour did run up to surround Dalinar, spears in hand. Dalinar waved them\nback. “There’s nothing you can do here, lads,” Dalinar said. “Let me face\nhim.”\nTen heartbeats.\n“Why?” Dalinar asked the assassin, who still stood there in the rain.\n“Why kill my brother? Did they explain the reasoning behind your orders?”\n“I am Szeth-son-son-Vallano,” the man said. Harshly. “Truthless of\nShinovar. I do as my masters demand, and I do not ask for explanations.”\nDalinar revised his assessment. This man was not calm. He seemed that\nway, but when he spoke, he did it through clenched teeth, his eyes open too\nwide.\nHe’s mad, Dalinar thought. Storms.\n“You don’t have to do this,” Dalinar said. “If it’s about pay…”\n“What I am owed,” the assassin shouted, rainwater spraying from his\nface and Stormlight rising from his lips, “will come to me eventually! Every\nbit of it. I will drown in it, stonewalker!”\nSzeth put his hand to the side, Shardblade appearing. Then, with a curt,\ndeprecatory motion—like he was merely trimming a bit of gristle from his\nmeat—he strode forward and swung at Dalinar."

Adolin gritted his teeth and struggled to get\nto his feet, something that was difficult with a broken greave. Though the\nrain was letting up, the sky remained dark. To the west, lightning plunged\ndownward like red waterfalls, almost constant.\nAt the same time, wind gusted from the east. Something was building\nout there too, from the Origin. This was very bad.\nThose things Father said to me…\nAdolin stumbled, almost falling to the ground, but hands appeared to\nassist him.

He could\nstill hear Roion screaming up above somewhere.\nAdolin thrust at the assassin, but the creature twisted and slapped the\nShardblade away. The assassin was grinning. He didn’t speak, though\nStormlight leaked between his teeth.\nAdolin tried Smokestance, attacking with a quick sequence of jabs. The\nassassin silently battered them away, unfazed. Adolin focused, dueling the\nbest he could, but he was a child before this thing.\nRoion, still screaming, plummeted from the sky and hit nearby with a\nsickening wet crunch.

Nothing can beat it.\nThe assassin landed lightly. Adolin climbed back to his feet, and found\nhimself in company. A dozen of the bridgemen formed up around him. Skar,\nat their head, looked to Adolin and nodded. Good men. They’d seen Roion’s\nfall, and still they joined him. Adolin hefted his Shardblade and noticed that\na short distance away, his father had managed to regain his feet. Another\nsmall group of bridgemen moved in around him, and he allowed it. He and\nAdolin had dueled and lost. Their only chance now was a mad rush.\nNearby, shouts arose. General Khal and a large strike force of soldiers,\njudging by the banner approaching. There wasn’t time. The assassin stood\non the wet plateau between Dalinar’s small troop and Adolin’s, head bowed.\nFallen blue lanterns gave light. The sky had gone as black as night, except\nwhen broken by that red lightning.\nCharge and mob a Shardbearer. Hope for a lucky blow. It was the only\nway. Adolin nodded to Dalinar.

Others lost spearheads as they\ntried to stab at him.\nThe assassin ripped free from the press of bodies, trailing blood from a\ncouple of wounds. Those wounds closed as Adolin watched, the blood\nstopping. It was as Kaladin had said. With a horrible sinking feeling, Adolin\nrealized just how little a chance they’d ever had.\nThe assassin dashed for Dalinar, who brought up the rear of the attack.\nThe aging soldier raised his Blade, as if in respect, then thrust once.\nAn attack.

Szeth looked horrified.\nGood.\nDalinar finally landed on the plateau with a soft step, and Kaladin’s\nLashing ran out.\n“Seek shelter,” Kaladin said, the tempest in his veins dampening further.\n“I flew over a storm on my way here… a big one. Coming from the west.”\n“We’re in the process of withdrawing.”\n“Hurry,” Kaladin said. “I will deal with our friend.”\n“Kaladin?”\nKaladin turned, glancing at the highprince, who stood tall, despite\ncradling one arm against his chest. Dalinar met his eyes. “You are what I’ve\nbeen looking for.”\n“Yes. Finally.”\nKaladin turned and strode toward the assassin. He passed Bridge Four\nin a tight formation, and the men—at a barked command from Teft—threw\nsomething down before Kaladin. Blue lanterns, lit by oversized gems that\nhad lasted the Weeping.\nBless them. Stormlight streamed up as he passed, filling him. With a\nsinking feeling, however, he noticed two corpses with burned-out eyes at\ntheir feet. Pedin and Mart. Eth clutched his brother’s body, weeping. Other\nbridgemen had lost limbs.\nKaladin snarled. No more. He would lose no further men to this\nmonster.\n“You ready?” he whispered.\nOf course, Syl said in his head. I’m not the one we’ve been waiting on.\nBurning with Stormlight, enraged and alight, Kaladin launched himself\nat the assassin and met him Blade against Blade.\n* * *\n“We’re dead…” Renarin muttered.\n“Someone shut him up,” Shallan snapped. “Gag him if you have to.”\nShe pointedly turned around, ignoring the raving prince. She still stood in\nthe center of the muraled chamber. The pattern. What was the pattern?\nA circular room. A thing on one side that adapted to fit different\nShardblades. Depictions of Knights on the floor, glowing with Stormlight,\npointing at a tower city, just as the myths described. Ten lamps on the walls.\nThe lock hung over what she thought was a depiction of Natanatan, the\nkingdom of the Shattered Plains. It—\nTen lamps. With gems in them.

He allowed himself a sigh of relief at their orderly march;\nthe majority of the army had already crossed to the southern plateau, only\none away from Shallan’s round one. That was wonderful. He couldn’t\nremember where Captain Khal had been sent, but with Roion himself fallen,\nDalinar had assumed he’d left this army in chaos.\n“Dalinar!” a voice called.\nHe turned to find the utterly incongruous sight of Sebarial and his\nmistress sitting beneath a canopy, eating dried sellafruit off a plate held by\nan awkward-looking soldier.\nSebarial raised a cup of wine toward Dalinar. “Hope you don’t mind,”\nSebarial said. “We liberated your stores.

You’ll find him that direction. Downwind, happily.”\n“Don’t dally,” Dalinar said. “You remain here, and you’re a dead man.”\n“Like Roion?” Sebarial asked.\n“Unfortunately.”\n“So it is true,” Sebarial said, standing up, brushing off his trousers—\nwhich were somehow still dry. “Who am I going to make fun of now?” He\nshook his head sadly.\nDalinar rode off in the direction indicated. He noticed that, incredibly, a\npair of bridgemen were still tailing him, only now catching up to where\nhe’d found Sebarial. They saluted as Dalinar noticed them.\nHe told them where he was going, then sped up. Storms. In terms of\npain, riding with broken ribs wasn’t much better than walking with them.\nWorse, actually.\nHe did find Aladar on the next plateau over, supervising his army as it\nseeped onto the perfectly round plateau that Shallan had indicated. Rust\nElthal was there as well, wearing his Plate—one of the suits Adolin had\nwon—and guiding one of Dalinar’s large, mechanical bridges. It settled\ndown next to two others that spanned the chasm here, crossing in places the\nsmaller bridges wouldn’t have been able to.\nThe plateau everyone was crowding onto was relatively small, by the\nscale of the Shattered Plains—but it was still several hundred yards across.\nIt would fit the armies, hopefully.\n“Dalinar?” Aladar asked, trotting his horse over. Lit by a large diamond\n—stolen from one of Navani’s fabrial lights, it seemed—hanging from his\nsaddle, Aladar sported a soaked uniform and a bandage on his forehead, but\nappeared otherwise unharmed. “What in Kelek’s tongue is going on out\nhere? I can’t get a straight answer from anyone.”\n“Roion is dead,” Dalinar said wearily, reining in Gallant. “He fell with\nhonor, attacking the assassin. The assassin, hopefully, has been distracted\nfor a time.”\n“We won the day,” Aladar said. “I scattered those Parshendi. We left\nwell over half of them dead on that plateau, perhaps even three quarters.\nAdolin did even better on his plateau, and from reports, the ones on Roion’s\nplateau have fled. The Vengeance Pact is fulfilled! Gavilar is avenged, and\nthe war is over!”\nSo proud. Dalinar had difficulty finding the words to deflate him, so he\njust stared at the other man. Feeling numb.\nCan’t afford that, Dalinar thought, sagging in his saddle. Have to lead.\n“It doesn’t matter, does it?” Aladar asked more softly. “That we won?”\n“Of course it matters.”\n“But… shouldn’t it feel different?”"

This is what victory\nusually feels like, Aladar. We’ve won, yes, but now we have to survive with\nour victory. Your men are almost across?”\nHe nodded.\n“Get everyone onto that plateau,” Dalinar said. “Force them up against\none another if you have to. We need to be ready to move through the portal\nas quickly as possible, once it is opened.”\nIf it opened.\nDalinar urged Gallant forward, crossing one of the bridges to the packed\nranks on the other side. From there, he forced his way—with difficulty—\ntoward the center, where he hoped to find salvation.\n* * *\nKaladin shot into the air after the assassin.\nThe Shattered Plains fell away beneath him. Fallen gemstones twinkled\nacross the plateau, abandoned where tents had blown down or soldiers had\nfallen. They illuminated not only the central plateau, but three others around\nit and one more beyond, one that looked oddly circular from above.\nThe armies gathered on that one. Small lumps dotted the others like\nfreckles. Corpses. So many.\nKaladin looked toward the sky. He was free once again. Winds surged\nbeneath him, seeming to lift him, propel him. Carry him. His Shardblade\nshattered into mist and Syl zipped out, becoming a ribbon of light that spun\naround him as he flew.\nSyl lived. Syl lived. He still felt euphoric about that. Shouldn’t she be\ndead? When he’d asked on their flight out, her response had been simple.\nI was only as dead as your oaths, Kaladin.\nKaladin continued upward, out of the path of the oncoming storms. He\ncould see those distinctly from this vantage. Two of them, one rolling from\nthe west and bursting with red lightning, the other approaching more\nquickly from the east with a dark grey stormwall. They were going to\ncollide.\n“A highstorm,” Kaladin said, shooting up through the sky after Szeth.\n“The red storm is from the Parshendi, but why is there a highstorm coming?\nThis isn’t the time for one.”\n“My father,” Syl said, voice growing solemn. “He brought the storm,\nrushing its pace. He’s… broken, Kaladin. He doesn’t think any of this\nshould be happening. He wants to end it all, wash everyone away, and try to\nhide from the future.”\nHer father… did that mean the Stormfather wanted them dead?\nGreat.\nThe assassin disappeared above, vanishing into the dark clouds. Kaladin\ngritted his teeth, Lashing himself upward again for more acceleration. He\nshot into the clouds, and all around him became featureless grey.\nHe kept watch for glimmers of light to announce the assassin coming\nfor him. He might not have much warning.\nThe area around him lightened. Was that the assassin? Kaladin extended\nhis hand to the side, and Syl formed into the Blade immediately.\n“Not ten heartbeats?” he asked.\nNot when I’m here with you, ready. The delay is primarily something of\nthe dead. They need to be revived each time."

They need to be revived each time.\nKaladin burst out of the clouds and into sunlight.\nHe gasped. He’d forgotten that it was still daytime. Here, far above the\nearthy darkness of war, the sunlight beat upon the cover of clouds, making\nthem glow with pale beauty. The thin air was frigid, but raging Stormlight\ninside him made that easy to ignore.\nThe assassin hovered nearby, toes pointed downward, head bowed,\nsilvery Shardblade held to the side. Kaladin Lashed himself so that he\nstopped, then sank level with the assassin.\n“I am Szeth-son-son-Vallano,” the man said. “Truthless… Truthless.”\nHe looked up, eyes wide, teeth clenched. “You have stolen Honorblades. It\nis the only explanation.”\nStorms. Kaladin had always imagined the Assassin in White as a calm,\ncold killer. This was something different.\n“I possess no such weapon,” Kaladin said. “And I don’t know why it\nwould matter if I did.”\n“I hear your lies. I know them.” Szeth shot forward, sword out.\nKaladin Lashed himself to the side, jerking out of the way. He swiped\nwith his Blade, but didn’t come close to connecting. “I should have\npracticed more with the sword,” he muttered.\nOh. That’s right. You probably want me to be a spear, don’t you?\nThe weapon fuzzed to mist, then elongated and grew into the shape of a\nsilvery spear, with glowing, swirling glyphs along the sharpened sides of\nthe spearhead.\nSzeth twisted in the air, Lashing himself back into a hovering position.\nHe looked at the spear, then seemed to tremble. “No. Truthless. I am\nTruthless. No questions.”\nStormlight streaming from his mouth, Szeth threw his head back and\nscreamed; a futile, human sound that dissipated in the infinite expanse of\nsky.\nBeneath them, thunder rumbled and the clouds shivered with color.\n* * *\nShallan dashed from lamp to lamp in the circular chamber, infusing\neach one with Stormlight. She glowed brightly, having drawn the Light\nfrom the ardents’ lanterns. There wasn’t time for explanation.\nSo much for keeping her nature as a Surgebinder hidden.\nThis room was a giant fabrial, powered by the Stormlight of those\nlamps. She should have seen it. She passed Inadara, who stared at her.\n“How… how are you doing this, Brightness?”\nSeveral of the scholars had settled onto the ground where they hurriedly\nsketched glyphward prayers onto cloths, using chalk because of the\nmoisture. Shallan didn’t know if those prayers were a request for safety\nfrom the storms or from Shallan herself. She did hear the words “Lost\nRadiant” murmured by one.\nTwo more lanterns. She infused a ruby with Stormlight, bringing it to\nlife, but then ran out of Light.\n“Gemstones!” she said, spinning on the room. “I need more\nStormlight.”\nThe people inside looked to one another, all but Renarin, who continued"

One of the scholars had dug an oil lantern from her pack, and\nit paled beside the lamps on the walls.\nShallan ducked out of the opening in the door, looking at the mass of\nsoldiers who gathered there. Thousands upon thousands shuffled in the\ndarkness. Fortunately, some of them carried lanterns.\n“I need your Stormlight!” she said. “It—”\nWas that Adolin? Shallan gasped, other thoughts fleeing for the moment\nas she spotted him in the front of the crowd, leaning on a bridgeman for\nsupport. Adolin was a mess, the left side of his face a patchwork of blood\nand bruises, his uniform ripped and bloodied. Shallan ran to him, pulling\nhim close.\n“Good to see you too,” he said, burying his face in her hair. “I hear\nyou’re going to get us out of this mess.”\n“Mess?” she asked.\nThunder rumbled and cracked without pause as red lightning blasted\ndown not in streaks but in sheets. Storms! She hadn’t realized it was so\nclose!\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. She looked left. A stormwall was approaching.\nThe storms were like two hands, closing in to crush the armies between\nthem.\nShallan breathed in sharply, and Stormlight entered her, bringing her to\nlife. Adolin had a gemstone or two on him, apparently. He pulled back,\nlooking her over.\n“You too?” he said.\n“Um…” She bit her lip. “Yeah. Sorry.”\n“Sorry? Storms, woman! Can you fly like he does?”\n“Fly?”\nThunder cracked. Impending doom. Right.\n“Make sure everyone is ready to move!” she said, dashing back into the\nchamber.\n* * *\nStorms crashed together beneath Kaladin. The clouds broke apart, black,\nred, and grey mingling in enormous swirls, lightning arcing among them. It\nseemed to be Aharietiam again, the ending of all things.\nAbove all this, atop the world, Kaladin fought for his life.\nSzeth flew by in a sweeping flash of silvery metal. Kaladin deflected the\nblow, the spear in his hand vibrating with a plangent ding. Szeth continued\non, passing him, and Kaladin Lashed himself in that direction.\nThey fell westward, skimming the tops of the clouds—though to\nKaladin’s eyes, that direction was down. He fell with his spear aimed, point\nstraight toward the murderous Shin.\nSzeth jerked left, and Kaladin followed, quickly Lashing himself that\nway. Violent, churning, angry clouds mixed beneath him. The two storms\nseemed to be fighting; the lightning that lit them was like thrown punches.\nCrashes sounded, and not all of them thunder. Near Kaladin a large stone\nchurned up through the clouds, spinning vapors across its length. It\nbreached in the light like a leviathan, then sank back into the clouds."

He drew close, then eased back, letting his\nacceleration match that of Szeth so they flew side by side.\nKaladin drove his spear toward the assassin. Szeth parried deftly,\nShardblade held in one hand while supporting the Blade from behind with\nthe other, diverting Kaladin’s thrust to the side.\n“The Knights Radiant,” Szeth screamed, “cannot have returned.”\n“They have,” Kaladin said, yanking his spear back. “And they’re going\nto kill you.” He Lashed himself slightly to the side as he swung, twisting in\nthe air and sweeping toward Szeth.\nSzeth jerked upward, however, passing over Kaladin’s spear. As they\ncontinued to fall through the air, clouds just beside them, Szeth dove inward\nand struck. Kaladin cursed, barely Lashing himself away in time.\nSzeth dove past him, disappearing into the clouds below, becoming just\na shadow. Kaladin tried to trace that shadow, but failed.\nSzeth burst up beside Kaladin a second later, striking with three quick\nblows. One took Kaladin in the arm, and he dropped Syl.\nDamnation. He Lashed himself back away from Szeth, then forced\nStormlight into his greying, lifeless hand. With an effort, he made the color\nreturn, but Szeth was already upon him with an airborne lunge.\nMist formed in Kaladin’s left hand as he raised it to ward, and a silvery\nshield appeared, glowing with a soft light. Szeth’s Blade deflected away,\ncausing the man to grunt in surprise.\nStrength returned to Kaladin’s right hand, the severing healed, but\nforcing that much Stormlight through it left him feeling drained. He fell\naway from Szeth, trying to keep his distance, but the assassin kept on him,\njerking each direction that Kaladin did as he tried to escape.\n“You are new at this,” Szeth called. “You cannot fight me. I will win.”\nSzeth zipped forward, and Syl formed into a spear in Kaladin’s hands\nagain. She seemed to be able to anticipate the weapon he wanted. Szeth\nslammed his weapon against Syl. It brought them face-to-face and they\ntumbled, eye to eye, their Lashings pulling them along the clouds.\n“I always win,” Szeth said. He said it in a strange way, as if angry.\n“You’re wrong,” Kaladin said. “About me. I’m not new to this.”\n“You only just acquired your abilities.”\n“No. The wind is mine. The sky is mine. They have been mine since\nchildhood. You are the trespasser here. Not me.”\nThey broke apart, Kaladin throwing the assassin backward. He stopped\nthinking so much about his Lashings, about what he should be doing.\nInstead, he let himself be.\nHe dove for Szeth, coat flapping, spear pointed for the man’s heart."

Syl formed an axehead halberd. It came within inches of\nSzeth’s face.\nThe assassin cursed, but responded with his Blade. A shield was in\nKaladin’s hand a split second later, and he slammed away the attack. Syl\nshattered even as he did so, forming back into a sword as Kaladin thrust\nforward with empty hands. The sword appeared, and the weapon bit deeply\ninto Szeth’s shoulder.\nThe assassin’s eyes widened. Kaladin twisted his Blade, pulling it out of\nthe assassin’s flesh, then tried a backhand to end the man permanently.\nSzeth was too fast. He Lashed himself backward, forcing Kaladin to follow,\npiling on Lashing after Lashing.\nSzeth’s hand still worked. Damnation. The strike to the shoulder hadn’t\nfully severed the soul leading to the arm. And Kaladin’s Stormlight was\nrunning out.\nSzeth’s looked even lower, fortunately. The assassin seemed to be using\nit up at a much faster rate than Kaladin, judging by the decreased glow\naround him. Indeed, he didn’t try to heal his shoulder—which would have\nrequired a lot of Light—but continued to flee, jerking back and forth, trying\nto outrun Kaladin.\nThe shadowy battle continued below, a tangle of lightning, winds, and\nspinning clouds. As Kaladin chased Szeth, something gargantuan moved\nbeneath the clouds, a shadow the size of a city. A second later, the top of an\nentire plateau broke through the dark clouds, twisting slowly, as if it had\nbeen thrown upward from below.\nSzeth almost ran into it. Instead, he Lashed upward enough to crest it,\nthen landed on the surface. He ran along it as it turned lethargically in the\nair, its momentum running out.\nKaladin landed behind him, though he retained most of a Lashing\nupward, keeping himself light. He ran up the side of the plateau, heading\nalmost directly upward toward the sky, dodging to the side as Szeth\nsuddenly twisted and cut through a rock formation, sending boulders\ntumbling downward.\nRocks clattered along the surface of the plateau, which itself began to\ntumble back down toward the ground. Szeth reached the peak and threw\nhimself off, and Kaladin followed shortly thereafter, launching from the\nstone surface, which sank like a dying ship into the roiling clouds.\nThey continued their chase, but Szeth did it falling backward along the\nstormtop, his eyes on Kaladin. Wild eyes. “You’re trying to convince me!”\nhe shouted. “You can’t be one of them!”\n“You’ve seen that I am,” Kaladin shouted back.\n“The Voidbringers!”\n“Are back,” Kaladin shouted.\n“THEY CAN’T BE. I AM TRUTHLESS!” The assassin panted. “I need\nnot fight you. You are not my target. I have… I have work to do. I obey!”\nHe turned and Lashed himself downward.\nInto the clouds, down toward the plateau where Dalinar had gone.\n* * *"

Four armies’ worth of men and women\ncrouched, soggy and wet, many holding their heads and hunkering down\nagainst wind that no longer blew.

He ended with his spear against the hilt of\nSzeth’s Blade, pressing the two together, mere inches from the assassin’s\nface.\n“It is actually true,” Szeth whispered.\n“Yes.”\nSzeth nodded, and the edge of tension seemed to fade from him,\nreplaced by an emptiness in his eyes. “Then I was right all along. I was\nnever Truthless. I could have stopped the murders at any time.”\n“I don’t know what that means,” Kaladin said. “But you never had to\nkill.”\n“My orders—”\n“Excuses! If that was why you murdered, then you’re not the evil man I\nassumed. You’re a coward instead.”\nSzeth looked him in the eyes, then nodded. He pushed Kaladin back,\nthen moved to swing.\nKaladin drove his hands forward, forming Syl into a sword. He\nexpected a parry. The move was intended to draw Szeth out of his attack\npattern.\nSzeth did not parry. He just closed his eyes."

He just closed his eyes.\nKaladin drove his Blade into the assassin’s chest right below the neck,\nsevering the spine. Smoke burned out from beneath his eyelids, and his\nBlade slipped from his fingers. It did not vanish.\nGet that! Syl sent him, a mental shout. Grab it, Kaladin. Don’t lose it!\nKaladin dove after the Blade, dropping Szeth’s corpse, letting it fall\nbackward into the stormwall. It vanished among the wind, the rain, and the\nlightning, trailing faint wisps of Stormlight.\nKaladin grabbed the Blade just before the storm consumed it. Then he\nLashed himself back upward, passing along the stormwall, the windspren\nhe’d attracted spiraling about him and laughing with pure joy. As he crested\nthe top of the storm, they burst around him and zipped away, moving off to\ndance in front of the still-advancing storm.\nThat left him with only one. Syl—in the form of a young woman in a\nfluttering dress, full-sized this time—hovered before him. She smiled as the\nstorm moved beneath them.\n“That was very nicely done,” she said. “Perhaps I’ll keep you around\nthis time.”\n“Thank you.”\n“You almost killed me, you realize.”\n“I realize. I thought I had.”\n“And?”\n“And… um… you are intelligent and articulate?”\n“You forgot the compliment.”\n“But I just said—”\n“Those were simple statements of fact.”\n“You’re wonderful,” he said. “Truly, Syl. You are.”\n“Also a fact,” she said, grinning. “But I’ll let it slide so long as you’re\nwilling to present me with a sufficiently sincere smile.”\nHe did.\nAnd it felt very, very good.\n87. The Riddens\nChaos in Alethkar is, of course, inevitable.\nWatch carefully, and do not let power in the\nkingdom solidify. The Blackthorn could become an\nally or our greatest foe, depending on whether he\ntakes the path of the warlord or not. If he seems\nlikely to sue for peace, assassinate him\nexpeditiously. The risk of competition is too great.\nFrom the Diagram, Writings upon the\nBedstand Lamp: paragraph 4 (Adrotagia’s\n3rd translation from the original\nhieroglyphics)\nThe Shattered Plains had been shattered again.\nKaladin strolled across them with Szeth’s Shardblade on his shoulder.\nHe passed heaps of rock and fresh cracks in the ground. Enormous puddles\nlike small lakes shimmered amid huge chunks of broken stone. Just to his\nleft, an entire plateau had crumbled into the chasms around it. The jagged,\nripped-up base of the plateau had a black, charred cast to it.\n“This is going to happen again?” Kaladin said. “That other storm is still\nout there?”\n“Yes,” Syl said, sitting on his shoulder. “A new storm.

But if the storm could do that to pure rock, what would it do to\na city? Particularly since it blew the wrong way.\nStormfather… Laits would no longer be laits. Buildings that had been\nconstructed to face away from the storms would suddenly be exposed.\n“I don’t know,” Syl said softly. “This is a new thing, Kaladin. Not from\nbefore. I don’t know how it happened or what it means. Hopefully, it won’t\nbe this bad except when a highstorm and an everstorm crash into each\nother.”\nKaladin grunted, picking his way over to the edge of his current plateau.\nHe breathed in a little Stormlight, then Lashed himself upward to offset the\nnatural pull of the ground. He became weightless. He pushed off lightly\nwith his foot and drifted across the chasm to the next plateau.\n“So how did the army vanish like that?” he asked, removing his Lashing\nand settling down on the rock.\n“Uh… how should I know?” Syl said. “I was kind of distracted.”\nHe grunted. Well, this was the plateau where everyone had been.\nPerfectly round. Odd, that. On a nearby plateau, what had once been a large\nhill had been cracked wide open, exposing the remnants of a building\ninside. This perfectly circular one was far more flat, though it looked like\nthere was a hill or something at the center. He strode in that direction.\n“So they’re all spren,” he said. “Shardblades.”\nSyl grew solemn.\n“Dead spren,” Kaladin added.\n“Dead,” Syl agreed. “Then they live again a little when someone\nsummons them, syncing a heartbeat to their essence.”\n“How can something be ‘a little’ alive?”\n“We’re spren,” Syl said. “We’re forces. You can’t kill us completely.\nJust… sort of.”\n“That’s perfectly clear.”\n“It’s perfectly clear to us,” Syl said. “You’re the strange ones. Break a\nrock, and it’s still there. Break a spren, and she’s still there. Sort of. Break a\nperson, and something leaves. Something changes. What’s left is just meat.\nYou’re weird.”\n“I’m glad we established that,” he said, stopping. He couldn’t see any\nevidence of the Alethi. Had they really escaped? Or had a sudden surge of\nthe storm swept them all into the chasms? It seemed unlikely such a disaster\nwould have left nothing behind.\nPlease let it not be so. He lifted Szeth’s sword off his shoulder and set it\ndown, point first, in front of him. It sank a few inches into the rock.\n“What about this?” he asked, looking over the thin, silvery weapon. An\nunornamented Blade. That was supposed to be odd. “It doesn’t scream\nwhen I hold it.”\n“That’s because it’s not a spren,” Syl said softly.\n“What is it, then?”\n“Dangerous.”\nShe stood up from his shoulder, then walked as if down a flight of steps\ntoward the sword.

        "text": "“What is it, then?”\n“Dangerous.”\nShe stood up from his shoulder, then walked as if down a flight of steps\ntoward the sword. She rarely flew when she had a human form. She flew as\na ribbon of light, or as a group of leaves, or as a small cloud. He’d never\nnoticed before how odd, yet normal, it was that she stuck to the nature of\nthe form she used.\nShe stopped just before the sword. “I think this is one of the\nHonorblades, the swords of the Heralds.”\nKaladin grunted. He’d heard of those.\n“Any man who holds this weapon will become a Windrunner,” Syl\nexplained, looking back at Kaladin. “The Honorblades are what we are\nbased on, Kaladin. Honor gave these to men, and those men gained powers\nfrom them. Spren figured out what He’d done, and we imitated it. We’re\nbits of His power, after all, like this sword. Be careful with it. It is a\ntreasure.”\n“So the assassin wasn’t a Radiant.”\n“No. But Kaladin, you have to understand. With this sword, someone\ncan do what you can, but without the… checks a spren requires.” She\ntouched it, then shivered visibly, her form blurring for a second. “This\nsword gave the assassin power to use Lashings, but it also fed upon his\nStormlight. A person who uses this will need far, far more Light than you\nwill. Dangerous levels of it.”\nKaladin reached out and took the sword by the hilt, and Syl flitted away,\nbecoming a ribbon of light. He hefted the weapon and set it back on his\nshoulder before continuing on his way. Yes, there was a hill up ahead,\nprobably a crem-covered building. As he drew closer, blessedly, he saw\nmotion around it.\n“Hello?” he called.\nThe figures near it stopped and turned. “Kaladin?” a familiar voice\ncalled. “Storms, is that you?”\nHe grinned, the figures resolving into men in blue uniforms. Teft\nscrambled across the rock like a madman to meet him. Others came after,\nshouting and laughing. Drehy, Peet, Bisig, and Sigzil, Rock towering over\nthem all.\n“Another one?” Rock asked, eyeing Kaladin’s Shardblade. “Or is he\nyours?”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “I took this from the assassin.”\n“He is dead, then?” Teft asked.\n“Yes.”\n“You slew the Assassin in White,” Bisig breathed. “It’s truly over then.”\n“I suspect that it is just beginning,” Kaladin said, nodding toward the\nbuilding. “What is this place?”\n“Oh!” Bisig said. “Come on! We need to show you the tower—that\nRadiant girl taught us how to summon the plateau back, so long as we have\nyou.”\n“Radiant girl?” Kaladin asked. “Shallan?”\n“You don’t sound surprised,” Teft said with a grunt.\n“She has a Shardblade,” Kaladin said. One that didn’t scream in his\nmind. Either she was a Radiant or she had another of these Honorblades. As\nhe stepped up to the building, he noticed a bridge in the shadows nearby."

As\nhe stepped up to the building, he noticed a bridge in the shadows nearby.\n“It’s not ours,” Kaladin said.\n“No,” Leyten said. “That belongs to Bridge Seventeen. We had to leave\nours behind in the storm.”\nRock nodded. “We were too busy stopping lighteyed heads from\nbecoming too friendly with swords of enemies. Ha! But we needed bridge\nhere. Way platform works, we had to get off him for Shallan Davar to\ntransport herself back.”\nKaladin poked his head into the chamber inside the hill, then paused at\nthe beauty he found inside. Other members of Bridge Four waited here,\nincluding a tall man Kaladin didn’t immediately recognize. Was that one of\nLopen’s cousins? The man turned around, and Kaladin realized what he’d\nmistaken for a cap was a reddish skullplate.\nParshendi. Kaladin tensed as the Parshendi man saluted. He was\nwearing a Bridge Four uniform.\nAnd he had the tattoo.\n“Rlain?” Kaladin said.\n“Sir,” Rlain said. His features were no longer rounded and plump, but\ninstead sharp, muscular, with a thick neck and a stronger jaw, now lined by\na red and black beard.\n“It appears you are more than you seemed,” Kaladin said.\n“Pardon, sir,” he said. “But I would suggest that applies to both of us.”\nWhen he spoke now, his voice had a certain musicality to it—an odd\nrhythm to his words.\n“Brightlord Dalinar has pardoned Rlain,” Sigzil explained, walking\naround Kaladin and entering the chamber.\n“For being Parshendi?” Kaladin asked.\n“For being a spy,” Rlain said. “A spy for a people who, it appears, no\nlonger exist.” He said this to a different beat, and Kaladin thought he could\nsense pain in that voice. Rock walked over and put a hand on Rlain’s\nshoulder.\n“We can give you the story once we get back to the city,” Teft said.\n“We figured you’d come back here,” Sigzil added. “To this plateau, and\nso we needed to be here to greet you, for all Brightness Davar grumbled.\nAnyway, there’s a lot to tell—a lot is happening. I think that you’re kind of\ngoing to be at the center of it.”\nKaladin took a deep breath, but nodded. What else did he expect? No\nmore hiding. He had made his decision.\nWhat do I tell them about Moash? he wondered as the members of\nBridge Four piled into the room around him, chattering about how he\nneeded to infuse the spheres in the lanterns. A couple of the men bore\nwounds from the fighting, including Bisig, who kept his right hand in his\ncoat pocket. Grey skin peeked out from the cuff. He’d lost the hand to the\nAssassin in White.\nKaladin pulled Teft aside. “Did we lose anyone else?” Kaladin asked. “I\nsaw Mart and Pedin.”\n“Rod,” Teft said with a grunt. “Dead to the Parshendi.”\nKaladin closed his eyes, breathing out in a hiss.

Rod had been one of\nLopen’s cousins, a jovial Herdazian who hardly spoke Alethi. Kaladin had\nbarely known him, but the man had still been Bridge Four. Kaladin’s\nresponsibility.\n“You can’t protect us all, son,” Teft said. “You can’t stop people from\nfeeling pain, can’t stop men from dying.”\nKaladin opened his eyes, but did not challenge those statements. Not\nvocally, at least.\n“Kal,” Teft said, voice getting even softer. “At the end there, right\nbefore you arrived… Storms, son, I swear I saw a couple of the lads\nglowing. Faintly, with Stormlight.”\n“What?”\n“I’ve been listening to readings of those visions Brightlord Dalinar\nsees,” Teft continued. “I think you should do the same. From what I can\nguess, it seems that the orders of the Knights Radiant were made up of more\nthan just the knights themselves.”\nKaladin looked over the men of Bridge Four, and found himself\nsmiling. He shoved down the pain at his losses, at least for the time being.\n“I wonder,” he said softly, “what it will do to Alethi social structure when\nan entire group of former slaves starts going about with glowing skin.”\n“Not to mention those eyes of yours,” Teft said with a grunt.\n“Eyes?” Kaladin said.\n“Haven’t you seen?” Teft said. “What am I saying? Ain’t no mirrors out\non the Plains. Your eyes, son. Pale blue, like glassy water. Lighter than that\nof any king.”\nKaladin turned away. He’d hoped his eyes wouldn’t change. The truth,\nthat they had, made him uncomfortable. It said worrisome things. He didn’t\nwant to believe that lighteyes had any grounds upon which to build the\noppression.\nThey still don’t, he thought, infusing the gemstones in the lanterns as\nSigzil instructed him. Perhaps the lighteyes rule because of the memory,\nburied deeply, of the Radiants. But just because they look a little like\nRadiants doesn’t mean they should have been able to oppress everyone.\nStorming lighteyes. He…\nHe was one of them now.\nStorm it!\nHe summoned Syl as a Blade, following Sigzil’s instructions, and used\nher as a key to work the fabrial.\n* * *\nShallan stood at the front gates of Urithiru, looking up, trying to\ncomprehend.\nInside, voices echoed in the grand hall and lights bobbed as people\nexplored. Adolin had taken command of that endeavor, while Navani set up\na camp to see to the wounded and to measure supplies. Unfortunately,\nthey’d left most of their food and gear behind on the Shattered Plains. In\naddition, the travel through the Oathgate had not been as cheap as Shallan\nhad first assumed.

        "text": "had first assumed. Somehow, the trip had drained the majority of the\ngemstones held by the men and women on the plateau—including Navani’s\nfabrials, clutched in the hands of engineers and scholars.\nThey had run a few tests. The more people you moved, the more Light\nwas required. It seemed that Stormlight, and not just the gemstones that\ncontained it, would become a valuable resource. Already, they had to ration\ntheir gemstones and lanterns to explore the building.\nSeveral scribes passed by, bringing paper to draw out maps of Adolin’s\nexploration. They bobbed quick, uncomfortable bows to Shallan and called\nher “Brightness Radiant.” She still hadn’t talked at length with Adolin about\nwhat had happened to her.\n“Is it true?” Shallan asked, tilting her head all the way back, looking up\nthe side of the enormous tower toward the blue sky high above. “Am I one\nof them?”\n“Mmm…” Pattern said from her skirt. “Almost you are. Still a few\nWords to say.”\n“What kind of words? An oath?”\n“Lightweavers make no oaths beyond the first,” Pattern said. “You must\nspeak truths.”\nShallan stared up at the heights for a time longer, then turned and\nwalked back down toward their improvised camp. It was not the Weeping\nhere. She wasn’t certain if that was because they were actually above the\nrainclouds, or if the weather patterns had simply been thrown off by the\narrival of the strange highstorms.\nIn camp, men sat on the stone, divided by ranks, shivering in their wet\ncoats. Shallan’s breath puffed before her, though she had taken in\nStormlight—just a dash—to keep herself from noticing the cold.\nUnfortunately, there wasn’t much to use for fires. The large stone field in\nfront of the tower city bore very few rockbuds, and the ones that did grow\nwere tiny, smaller than a fist. They would provide little wood for fires.\nThe field was ringed by ten columnar plateaus, with steps winding\naround their bases. The Oathgates. Beyond that extended the mountain\nrange.\nCrem did cover some of the steps here, and dripped over the sides of the\nopen field. There wasn’t nearly as much as there had been on the Shattered\nPlains. Less rain must fall up here.\nShallan stepped up to one edge of the stone field. A sheer drop. If\nNohadon really had walked to this city, as The Way of Kings claimed, then\nhis path would have included scaling cliff faces. So far, they had found no\nway down other than through the Oathgates—and even if there were such a\nway, one would still be stranded in the middle of the mountains, weeks\nfrom civilization. Judging from the sun height, the scholars placed them\nnear the center of Roshar, somewhere in the mountains near Tu Bayla or\nmaybe Emul.\nThe remote location made the city incredibly defensible, or so Dalinar\nsaid. It also left them isolated, potentially cut off. And that, in turn,\nexplained why everyone looked at Shallan as they did. They’d tried other\nShardblades; none were effective at making the ancient fabrial work.\nShallan was literally their only way out of these mountains."

Eyes followed her as\nshe walked: soldiers, scribes, lighteyes, and highlords alike. Well, let them\nsee Shallan the Radiant. She could always find freedom later, wearing\nanother face.\nDalinar and Navani supervised a group of women near the center of the\narmy. “Any luck?” Shallan asked, approaching.\nDalinar glanced at her. The scribes wrote letters using every spanreed\nthey had, delivering messages of warning to the warcamps and to the relay\nroom in Tashikk. A new storm might come, blowing in from the west, not the\neast. Prepare.\nNew Natanan, on the very eastern coast of Roshar, would be struck\ntoday after the everstorm left the Shattered Plains.

Were the highstorms all one\nstorm that rounded the planet, or did a new one start at the Origin each time,\nas mythology claimed?\nScholars and stormwardens thought the former, these days. Their\ncalculations said that, assuming the everstorm moved at the same speed as a\nhighstorm this time of year, they’d have a few days before it returned and\nhit Shinovar and Iri, then blew across the continent, laying waste to cities\nthought protected.\n“No news,” Dalinar said, voice tense. “The king seems to have\nvanished. What’s more, Kholinar appears to be in a state of riot. I haven’t\nbeen able to get straight answers on either question.”\n“I’m sure the king is somewhere safe,” Shallan said, glancing at Navani.\nThe woman maintained a composed face, but as she gave instructions to a\nscribe, her voice was terse and clipped.\nOne of the pillarlike plateaus nearby flashed. It happened with a wall of\nlight revolving around its perimeter, leaving streaks of blurred afterimage to\nfade. Someone had activated the Oathgate.\nDalinar stepped up beside her and they waited tensely, until a group of\nfigures in blue appeared at the plateau edge and started down the steps.\nBridge Four.\n“Oh, thank the Almighty,” Shallan whispered. It was him, not the\nassassin.\nOne of the figures pointed down toward where Dalinar and the rest of\nthem stood. Kaladin separated from his men, dropping off the steps and\nfloating over the army. He landed on the stones in stride, carrying a\nShardblade on his shoulder, his long officer’s coat unbuttoned and coming\ndown to his knees.\nHe still has the slave brands, she thought, though his long hair obscured\nthem. His eyes had become a pale blue. They glowed softly.\n“Stormblessed,” Dalinar called."

I put him someplace safe before coming to help\nDalinar.”\n“Where?” Navani demanded. “We’ve had our people in the warcamps\nsearch monasteries, mansions, the barracks…”\n“Those places were too obvious,” Kaladin said. “If you could think to\nlook there, so might the assassins. I needed someplace nobody would think\nof.”\n“Where, then?” Dalinar asked.\nKaladin smiled.\n* * *\nThe Lopen made a fist with his hand, clutching the sphere inside. In the\nnext room over, his mother scolded a king.\n“No, no, Your Majesty,” she said, words thickly accented, using the\nsame stern tone she used with the axehounds. “You roll the whole thing up\nand eat it. You can’t pick it apart like that.”\n“I don’t feel so hungry, nanha,” Elhokar said. His voice was weak, but\nhe’d awoken from his drunken stupor, which was a good sign.\n“You’ll eat anyway!” Mother said. “I know what to do when I see a man\nthat pale in the face, and pardon, Your Majesty, but you are pale as a sheet\nhung out for the sun to bleach! And that’s the truth of it. You’re going to eat.\nNo complaints.”\n“I’m the king. I don’t take orders from—”\n“You’re in my home now!” she said, and Lopen mouthed along with the\nwords. “In a Herdazian woman’s home, nobody’s station means nothing\nbeside her own. I’m not going to have them come and get you and find you\nnot properly fed! I’ll not have people saying that, Your Brightship, no I\nwon’t! Eat up. I’ve got soup cooking.”\nThe Lopen smiled, and though he heard the king grumble, he also heard\nthe sound of spoon against plate. Two of Lopen’s strongest cousins sat out\nfront of the hovel in Little Herdaz—which was technically in Highprince\nSebarial’s warcamp, though the Herdazians didn’t pay much attention to\nthat. Four more cousins sat at the end of the street, idly sewing some boots,\nwatching for anything suspicious.\n“All right,” Lopen whispered, “you really need to work this time.” He\nfocused on that sphere in his hand. Just like he did every day, and had done\nevery day since Captain Kaladin had started glowing. He’d figure it out\nsooner or later. He was as sure of it as he was sure of his name."

I can’t make sense of it.” He\nshook his head. “First that highstorm nobody knew about, then the rains\nstop early, then the storming king man of Alethkar on my doorstep. Now\nthis.

All parshmen were to be left behind, and everyone was to make\ntheir way toward the center of the Shattered Plains.\nSome of the highprinces obeyed. Others did not. Curiously, Sadeas was\none of those who obeyed, his warcamp emptying almost as quickly as those\nof Sebarial, Roion, and Aladar. It seemed like everyone was going, even the\nchildren."

It seemed like everyone was going, even the\nchildren.\nMoash’s cart rolled to a stop. Graves stepped up beside the back a few\nmoments later. “We needn’t have worried about hiding,” he mumbled,\nlooking over the exodus. “They’re too busy to pay attention to us. Look\nthere.”\nSome groups of merchants gathered outside of Dalinar’s warcamps.\nThey pretended to be packing to leave, but weren’t making any obvious\nprogress.\n“Scavengers,” Graves said. “They’ll head into the abandoned warcamps\nto loot. Storming fools. They deserve what is coming.”\n“What is coming?” Moash said. He felt as if he had been tossed into a\nroiling river, one that had burst its banks following a highstorm. He swam\nwith the current, but could barely keep his head above water.\nHe’d tried to kill Kaladin. Kaladin. It had all fallen apart. The king\nsurvived, Kaladin’s powers were back, and Moash… Moash was a traitor.\nTwice over.\n“Everstorm,” Graves said. He didn’t look nearly so refined, now that he\nwore the patchwork overalls and shirt of a poor darkeyes. He’d used some\nstrange eyedrops to change his eyes dark, then had instructed Moash to do\nthe same.\n“And that is?”\n“The Diagram is vague,” Graves said. “We only knew the term because\nof old Gavilar’s visions. The Diagram says this will probably return the\nVoidbringers, though. Those have turned out to be the parshmen, it seems.”\nHe shook his head. “Damnation. That woman was right.”\n“Woman?”\n“Jasnah Kholin.”\nMoash shook his head. He didn’t understand any of what was\nhappening. Graves’s sentences felt like strings of words that shouldn’t go\ntogether. Parshmen, Voidbringers? Jasnah Kholin? That was the king’s\nsister. Hadn’t she died at sea? What did Graves know of her?\n“Who are you really?” Moash asked.\n“A patriot,” Graves said. “Just like I told you. We’re allowed to pursue\nour own interests and goals until we’re called up.” He shook his head. “I\nthought for sure my interpretation was correct, that if we removed Elhokar,\nDalinar would become our ally in what is to come… Well, it appears I was\nwrong. Either that, or I was too slow.”\nMoash felt sick.\nGraves gripped him on the arm. “Head up, Moash. Bringing a\nShardbearer back with me will mean that my mission wasn’t a complete\nloss. Besides, you can tell us about this new Radiant. I’ll introduce you to\nthe Diagram. We have an important work.”\n“Which is?”\n“The salvation of the entire world, my friend.” Graves patted him, then\nwalked toward the front of the cart, where the others rode.\nThe salvation of the entire world.\nI’ve been played for one of the ten fools, Moash thought, chin to his\nchest. And I don’t even know how.\nThe wagon started rolling again."

Night was approaching, and the temperature was\ndropping outside. Beyond that, the highstorm that had hit the Shattered\nPlains would be raging across the land currently, and would eventually hit\nthese mountains. It took over a day for one to cross the entire continent, and\nthey were probably somewhere near the center, so it would be growing\nclose.\nAn unscheduled highstorm, Shallan thought, walking through the dark\nhallways with her guards. And something else coming from the other\ndirection.\nShe could tell that this tower—its contents, every hallway—was a\nmajestic wonder. It spoke worlds about how tired she was that she didn’t\nwant to draw any of it. She just wanted to sleep.\nTheir spherelight revealed something odd on the wall ahead. Shallan\nfrowned, shaking off her fatigue and stepping up to it. A small folded piece\nof paper, like a card. She glanced back at her guards, who looked equally\nconfused.\nShe pulled the card off the wall; it had been stuck in place with some\nweevilwax on the back. Inside was the triangle symbol of the Ghostbloods.\nBeneath it, Shallan’s name. Not Veil’s name.\nShallan’s.\nPanic. Alertness. In a moment, she had sucked in the Light of their\nlantern, plunging the corridor into darkness. Light shone from a doorway\nnearby, however.\nShe stared at it. Gaz moved to investigate, but Shallan stopped him with\na gesture.\nRun or fight?\nRun where? she thought. Hesitant, she stepped up to the doorway, again\nmotioning her guards back.\nMraize stood inside, gazing out a large, glassless window that\noverlooked another section of the innards of this tower. He turned toward\nher, twisted and scarred, yet somehow refined in his gentleman’s clothing.\nSo. She had been found out.\nI am no longer a child who hides in her room when the shouting comes,\nshe thought firmly to herself, walking into the room. If I run from this man,\nhe will see me as something to be hunted.\nShe stepped right up to him, ready to summon Pattern. He wasn’t like\nother Shardblades; she acknowledged that now. He could come more\nquickly than the ten requisite heartbeats.\nHe’d done that before. She hadn’t been willing to admit that he was\ncapable of it. Admitting that would have meant too much.\nHow many more of my lies, she thought, hold me back from things I\ncould accomplish?"

Needed them.\n“You led me on a grand hunt, Veil,” Mraize said. “If your abilities had\nnot been manifest during the course of saving the army, I perhaps never\nwould have located your false identity.”\n“Veil is the false identity, Mraize,” Shallan said. “I am me.”\nHe inspected her. “I think not.”\nShe met that gaze, but shivered inside.\n“A curious position you are in,” Mraize said. “Will you hide the true\nnature of your powers? I was able to guess what they are, but others will not\nbe so knowledgeable. They might see only the Blade, and not ask what else\nyou can do.”\n“I don’t see how it’s a concern of yours.”\n“You are one of us,” Mraize said. “We look after our own.”\nShallan frowned. “But you’ve seen through the lie.”\n“Are you saying you don’t want to be one of the Ghostbloods?” His\ntone was not threatening, but those eyes… storms, those eyes could have\ndrilled through stone. “We do not offer the invitation to just anyone.”\n“You killed Jasnah,” Shallan hissed.\n“Yes. After she, in turn, had assassinated a number of our members. You\ndidn’t think her hands were clean of blood, did you, Veil?”\nShe looked away, breaking his gaze.\n“I should have guessed that you would turn out to be Shallan Davar,”\nMraize continued. “I feel a fool for not seeing it earlier. Your family has a\nlong history of involvement in these events.”\n“I will not help you,” Shallan said.\n“Curious. You should know that I have your brothers.”\nShe looked to him sharply.\n“Your house is no more,” Mraize said. “Your family’s grounds seized by\na passing army. I rescued your brothers from the chaos of the succession\nwar, and am bringing them here. Your family, however, does owe me a debt.\nOne Soulcaster. Broken.”\nHe met her eyes. “How convenient that you, by my estimations, are\none, little knife.”\nShe summoned Pattern. “I will kill you before I let you use them as\nblackmail—”\n“No blackmail,” Mraize said. “They will arrive safe. A gift to you. You\nmay wait upon my words and see. I mention your debt only so that it has a\nchance to find… purchase in your mind.”\nShe frowned, holding her Shardblade, wavering. “Why?” she finally\nasked.\n“Because, you are ignorant.” Mraize stepped closer to her, towering\nover her. “You don’t know who we are. You don’t know what we’re trying\nto accomplish. You don’t know much of anything at all, Veil. Why did your\nfather join us? Why did your brother seek out the Skybreakers? I have done\nsome research, you see. I have answers for you.” Surprisingly, he turned\nfrom her and walked toward the doorway. “I will give you time to consider.\nYou seem to think that your newfound place among the Radiants makes you"

Let Shallan\nDavar be a Radiant, conformist and noble. Let Veil come to us.” He stopped\nby the doorway. “And let her find truth.”\nHe disappeared into the hallway. Shallan found herself feeling even\nmore drained than before. She dismissed Pattern and leaned back against\nthe wall. Of course Mraize would have found his way here—he’d likely\nbeen among the armies, somewhere. Getting to Urithiru had been one of the\nGhostbloods’ primary goals. Despite her determination not to help them,\nshe’d transported them—along with the army—right where they wanted to\ngo.\nHer brothers? Would they actually be safe? What of her family servants,\nher brother’s betrothed?\nShe sighed, walking to the doorway and collecting her guards. Let her\nfind truth. What if she didn’t want to find the truth? Pattern hummed softly.\nAfter walking through the tower’s ground floor—using her own glow\nfor light—she found Adolin in the hallway beside a room, where he’d said\nhe’d be. He had his wrist wrapped, and the bruises on his face were starting\nto purple. They made him look slightly less intoxicatingly handsome,\nthough there was a rugged “I punched a lot of people today” quality to that,\nwhich was fetching in its own right.\n“You look exhausted,” he said, giving her a peck of a kiss.\n“And you look like you let someone play sticks with your face,” she\nsaid, but smiled at him. “You should get some sleep too.”\n“I will,” he said. “Soon.” He touched her face. “You’re amazing, you\nrealize. You saved everything. Everyone.”\n“No need to treat me like I’m glass, Adolin.”\n“You’re a Radiant,” he said. “I mean…” He ran his hand through his\npersistently messy hair. “Shallan. You’re something greater than even a\nlighteyes.”\n“Was that a wisecrack about my girth?”\n“What? No. I mean…” He blushed.\n“I will not let this be awkward, Adolin.”\n“But—”\nShe grabbed him in an embrace and forced him into a kiss, a deep and\npassionate one. He tried to mumble something, but she kept on kissing,\npressing her lips against his, letting him feel her desire. He melted into the\nkiss, then grabbed her by the torso and pulled her close.\nAfter a moment, he pulled back. “Storms, that smarts!”\n“Oh!” Shallan raised a hand to her mouth, remembering the bruises on\nhis face. “Sorry.”\nHe grinned, then winced again, as apparently that hurt too. “Worth it.\nAnyway, I’ll promise to avoid being awkward if you avoid being too\nirresistible. At least until I’m healed up. Deal?”\n“Deal.”\nHe looked to her guards. “Nobody disturbs the Lady Radiant,\nunderstand?”\nThey nodded.\n“Sleep well,” he said, pushing open a door into the room. Many of the\nrooms still had wooden doors, despite their long abandonment. “Hopefully,"

Many of the\nrooms still had wooden doors, despite their long abandonment. “Hopefully,\nthe room is suitable. Your spren chose it.”\nHer spren? Shallan frowned, then stepped into the room. Adolin closed\nthe door.\nShallan studied the windowless stone chamber. Why had Pattern chosen\nthis particular place for her? The room didn’t seem distinctive. Adolin had\nleft a Stormlight lantern for her that was extravagant, considering how few\nlit gemstones they had—and it showed a small square chamber with a stone\nbench in the corner. There were a few blankets on it. Where had Adolin\nfound blankets?\nShe frowned at the wall. The rock here was faded in a square, as if\nsomeone had once hung a picture there. Actually, that looked oddly\nfamiliar. Not that she’d been here before, but the place that square hung on\nthe wall…\nIt was exactly in the same place where the picture had hung on her\nfather’s wall back in Jah Keved.\nHer mind started to fuzz.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said from the floor beside her. “It is time.”\n“No.”\n“It is time,” he repeated. “The Ghostbloods circle you. The people need\na Radiant.”\n“They have one. The bridgeboy.”\n“Not enough. They need you.”\nShallan blinked out tears. Against her will, the room started to change.\nWhite carpet appeared. A picture on the wall. Furniture. Walls painted light\nblue.\nTwo corpses.\nShallan stepped over one, though it was just an illusion, and walked to\nthe wall. A painting had appeared, part of the illusion, and it was outlined\nwith a white glow. Something was hidden behind it. She pulled aside the\npicture, or tried to. Her fingers only made the illusion blur.\nThis was nothing. Just a re-creation of a memory she wished she didn’t\nhave.\n“Mmm… A better lie, Shallan.”\nShe blinked away tears. Her fingers lifted, and she pressed them against\nthe wall again. This time, she could feel the painting’s frame. It wasn’t real.\nFor the moment, she pretended that it was, and let the image capture her.\n“Can’t I just keep pretending?”\n“No.”\nShe was there, in her father’s room. Trembling, she pulled aside the\npicture, revealing the strongbox in the wall beyond. She raised the key, and\nhesitated. “Mother’s soul is inside.”\n“Mmm… No. Not her soul. That which took her soul.”\nShallan unlocked the safe, then tugged it open, revealing the contents. A\nsmall Shardblade. Thrust into the strongbox hastily, tip piercing through the\nback, hilt toward her.\n“This was you,” she whispered.\n“Mmm… Yes.”\n“Father took you from me,” Shallan said, “and tried to hide you in here.\nOf course, that was useless. You vanished as soon as he closed the\nstrongbox. Faded to mist. He wasn’t thinking clearly. Neither of us were.”\nShe turned.\nRed carpet. Once white.

Shallan walked to the\nother corpse, the one facedown in the beautiful dress of blue and gold.

Her mother’s arrival, with a friend Shallan\ndidn’t recognize, to confront her father. Her mother’s shouts, arguing with\nher father.\nMother calling Shallan one of them.\nHer father barging in. Mother’s friend with a knife, the two struggling,\nthe friend getting cut in the arm. Blood spilled on the carpet. The friend had\nwon that fight, eventually holding Father down, pinned on the ground.\nMother took the knife and came for Shallan.\nAnd then…\nAnd then a sword in Shallan’s hands.\n“He let everyone believe that he’d killed her,” Shallan whispered. “That\nhe’d murdered his wife and her lover in a rage, when I was the one who had\nactually killed them. He lied to protect me.”\n“I know.”\n“That secret destroyed him. It destroyed our entire family.”\n“I know.”\n“I hate you,” she whispered, staring into her mother’s dead eyes.\n“I know.” Pattern buzzed softly. “Eventually, you will kill me, and you\nwill have your revenge.”\n“I don’t want revenge. I want my family.”\nShallan wrapped her arms around herself and buried her head in them,\nweeping as the illusion bled white smoke, then vanished, leaving her in an\nempty room.\n* * *\nI can only conclude, Amaram wrote hurriedly, the glyphs a mess of\nsloppy ink, that we have been successful, Restares.

They have apparently unleashed a new storm\nupon this world.\nHe looked up from his pad and peeked out the window. His carriage\nrattled down the roadway in Dalinar’s warcamp. All of his soldiers were\naway, and his remaining guards had gone to oversee the exodus. Even with\nAmaram’s reputation, he’d been able to pass into the camp with ease.\nHe turned back to his paper. I do not exult in this success, he wrote.\nLives will be lost. It has ever been our burden as the Sons of Honor. To\nreturn the Heralds, to return the dominance of the Church, we had to put\nthe world into a crisis.\nThat crisis we now have, a terrible one. The Heralds will return. How\ncan they not, with the problems we now face? But many will die. So very\nmany. Nalan send that it is worth the loss. Regardless, I will have more\ninformation soon.

He\nwould have done it himself, but you could not use a spanreed while moving.\nShe would destroy the papers when done. Amaram spared a glance for\nthe trunks on the back of the coach; they contained a precious cargo,\nincluding all of his maps, notes, and theories. Should he have left those with\nhis soldiers? Bringing the force of fifty into Dalinar’s warcamp would have\ndrawn attention for certain, even with the chaos here, so he’d ordered them\nto meet him on the Plains.\nHe needed to keep moving. He strode away from the coach, pulling up\nthe hood on his cloak. The grounds of Dalinar’s temple complex were even\nmore frenzied than most of the warcamps, as many people had come to the\nardents in this time of stress. He passed a mother begging for one of them to\nburn a prayer for her husband, who fought with Dalinar’s army. The ardent\nkept repeating that she should gather her things and join the caravans\nheading out across the Plains.\nIt was happening. It was really happening. The Sons of Honor had, at\nlong last, achieved their goal. Gavilar would be proud. Amaram hastened\nhis pace, turning as another ardent bustled up to him, to ask if he needed\nanything. Before she could look in his hood and recognize him, however,\nher attention was drawn by a pair of frightened youths who complained that\ntheir father was too old to make the trip, and begged for the ardents to help\nthem carry him somehow.\nHe made it to the corner of the monastery building where they kept the\ninsane and rounded to the back wall, out of sight, near the rim of the\nwarcamp itself. He looked about, then summoned his Blade. A few swift\nslices would—\nWhat was that?\nHe spun, certain he’d seen someone approach. But it was nothing.\nShadows playing tricks on him. He made his slices in the wall and then\ncarefully pushed open the hole he’d made. The Great One—Talenelat’Elin,\nHerald of War himself—sat in the dark room, in much the same posture\nhe’d borne before. Perched on the end of his bed, slumped forward, head\nbowed.\n“Why must they keep you in such darkness?” Amaram said, dismissing\nhis Blade. “This is not fit for the lowliest of men, let alone one such as\nyourself. I will have words with Dalinar about the way the insane are—”\nNo, he would not. Dalinar thought him a murderer. Amaram drew in a\nlong, deep breath. Prices would need to be paid to see the Heralds return,\nbut by Jezerezeh himself, the loss of Dalinar’s friendship would be a stiff\none indeed. Would that mercy had not stayed his hand, all those months\nago, when he could have executed that spearman.\nHe hastened to the Herald’s side. “Great Prince,” Amaram whispered.\n“We must go.”\nTalenelat did not move.

Who knew that Dalinar had grown so\ncrafty in his old age? Time had changed both of them.\n“Please, Great Prince,” Amaram said, getting the Herald to his feet with\nsome difficulty. The man was enormous, as tall as Amaram but built like a\nwall. The dark brown skin had surprised him the first time he’d seen the\nman—Amaram had, somewhat foolishly, expected that all of the Heralds\nwould look Alethi.\nThe Herald’s dark eyes were, of course, some kind of disguise.\n“The Desolation…” Talenelat whispered.\n“Yes. It comes. And with it, your return to glory.” Amaram began to\nwalk the Herald toward his opening. “We must get you to—”\nThe Herald’s hand snapped up in front of him.\nAmaram started, freezing in place, as he saw something in the Herald’s\nfingers. A small dart, the tip dripping with some clear liquid.\nAmaram glanced at the opening, which spilled sunlight into the room. A\nsmall figure there made a puffing sound, a blowgun held to lips beneath a\nhalf mask that covered the upper face.\nThe Herald’s other hand shot out, quick as an eyeblink, and snatched the\ndart from the air mere inches from Amaram’s face. The Ghostbloods. They\nweren’t trying to kill the Herald.\nThey were trying to kill Amaram.\nHe cried out, reaching his hand to the side, summoning his Blade. Too\nslow. The figure looked from him to the Herald, then scuttled away with a\nsoft curse. Amaram chased after, leaping the rubble of the wall and breaking\nout into light, but the figure was moving too quickly.\nHeart thumping in his chest, he looked back toward Talenelat, worried\nfor the Herald’s safety. Amaram started as he found the Herald standing tall,\nstraight-backed, head up. Dark brown eyes, startlingly lucid, reflected the\nlight of the opening. Talenelat raised one dart before himself and inspected\nit.\nThen he dropped both darts and sat back down on his bed. His strange,\nunchanging mantra started over again, muttered. Amaram felt a chill run\ndown his spine, but when he returned to the Herald, he could not get the\nman to respond.\nWith effort, he made the Herald rise again and ushered him to the coach.\n* * *\nSzeth opened his eyes.\nHe immediately squeezed them closed again. “No. I died.

Something\ndifferent.\nStill kneeling, Szeth looked up after the man. “My people have the other\nHonorblades, and have kept them safe for millennia. If I am to bring\njudgment to them, I will face enemies with Shards and with power.”\n“This is not a problem,” Nin said, looking back. “I have brought a\nShardblade for you. One that is a perfect match for your task and\ntemperament.” He tossed his large sword to the ground. It skidded on stone\nand came to a rest before Szeth.\nHe had not seen a sword with a metal sheath before. And who sheathed\na Shardblade? And the Blade itself… was it black? An inch or so of it had\nemerged from the sheath as it slid on the rocks.\nSzeth swore he could see a small trail of black smoke coming off the\nmetal. Like Stormlight, only dark.\nHello, a cheerful voice said in his mind. Would you like to destroy some\nevil today?\n89.

As a collection.\nHe stepped to the balcony doors and pushed them open.\nWarm light bathed him. A deep, enveloping, piercing warmth. A warmth\nthat soaked down deep through his skin, into his very self. He stared at that\nlight, and was not blinded. The source was distant, but he knew it. Knew it\nwell.\nHe smiled.\nThen he awoke. Alone in his new rooms in Urithiru, a temporary\nlocation for him to stay while they scouted the entire tower. A week had\npassed since they had arrived at this place, and the people of the warcamps\nhad finally started to arrive, bearing spheres recharged during the\nunexpected highstorm. They needed those badly to make the Oathgate\nfunction.\nThose from the warcamps arrived none too soon. The Everstorm had not\nyet returned, but if it moved like a regular highstorm, it should be striking\nany day now.\nDalinar sat in the darkness for a short time, contemplating that warmth\nhe had felt. What had that been? It had been an odd time to get one of the\nvisions. They always came during highstorms. Before, when he’d felt one\ncoming on while sleeping, it had awakened him.\nHe checked with his guards. No highstorm was blowing.\nContemplative, he started to dress. He wanted to see if he could get out onto\nthe roof of the tower today.\n* * *\nAs Adolin walked the dark halls of Urithiru, he tried not to show how\noverwhelmed he felt. The world had just shifted, like a door on its hinges. A\nfew days ago, his causal betrothal had been that of a powerful man to a\nrelatively minor scion of a distant house. Now, Shallan might be the most\nimportant person in the world, and he was…\nWhat was he?\nHe raised his lantern, then made a few marks in chalk on the wall to\nindicate he’d been here. This tower was huge. How did the entire thing stay\nup? They could probably explore in here for months without opening every\ndoor. He had thrown himself into the duty of exploration because it seemed\nlike something he could do. It also, unfortunately, gave him time to think.\nHe didn’t like how few answers he came up with.\nHe turned around, realizing he’d gotten far from the rest of his scouting\nparty. He was doing that more and more often. The first groups from the\nShattered Plains had started arriving, and they needed to decide where to\nhouse everyone.\nWere those voices ahead? Adolin frowned, then continued down the\ncorridor, leaving his lantern behind so it wouldn’t give him away. He was\nsurprised when he recognized one of the speakers down the hallway. Was\nthat Sadeas?\nIt was. The highprince stood with a scouting party of his own. Silently,\nAdolin cursed the wind that had persuaded Sadeas—of all people—to heed\nthe call to come to Urithiru. Everything would have been so much easier if\nhe’d just stayed behind.\nSadeas gestured for a few of his soldiers to go down one branch of the\ntunnel-like corridor.

His wife and a few of her scribes went the other way,\ntwo soldiers trailing. Adolin watched for a moment as the highprince\nhimself raised a lantern, inspecting a faded painting on the wall. A fanciful\npicture, with animals from mythology. He recognized a few from children’s\nstories, like the enormous, minklike creature with the mane of hair that\nburst out around and behind its head. What was it called again?\nAdolin turned to go, but his boot scraped stone.\nSadeas spun, raising his lantern. “Ah, Prince Adolin.” He wore white,\nwhich really didn’t help his complexion—the pale color made his ruddy\nfeatures seem downright bloody by comparison.\n“Sadeas,” Adolin said, turning back. “I wasn’t aware that you had\narrived.” Storming man. He’d ignored Father all those months, and now he\ndecided to obey?\nThe highprince strolled up the hallway, passing Adolin. “This place is\nremarkable. Remarkable indeed.”\n“So you acknowledge that my father was right,” Adolin said. “That his\nvisions are true. The Voidbringers have returned, and you are made a fool.”\n“I will admit,” Sadeas said, “there is more fight left to your father than\nI’d once feared. A remarkable plan. Contacting the Parshendi, working out\nthis deal with them. They put on quite a show, I hear. It certainly convinced\nAladar.”\n“You can’t possibly believe it was all a show.”\n“Oh please. You deny that he had a Parshendi among his own guard?\nIsn’t it convenient that these new ‘Radiants’ include the head of Dalinar’s\nguard and your own betrothed?”\nSadeas smiled, and Adolin saw the truth. No, he didn’t believe this, but\nit was the lie he would tell. He would start the whisperings again, trying to\nundermine Dalinar.\n“Why?” Adolin asked, stepping up to him. “Why are you like this,\nSadeas?”\n“Because,” Sadeas said with a sigh, “it has to happen. You can’t have an\narmy with two generals, son. Your father and I, we’re two old whitespines\nwho both want a kingdom. It’s him or me. We’ve been pointed that way\nsince Gavilar died.”\n“It doesn’t have to be that way.”\n“It does. Your father will never trust me again, Adolin, and you know\nit.” Sadeas’s face darkened. “I will take this from him. This city, these\ndiscoveries. It’s just a setback.”\nAdolin stood for a moment, staring Sadeas in the eyes, and then\nsomething finally snapped.\nThat’s it.\nAdolin grabbed Sadeas by the throat with his unwounded hand,\nslamming the highprince back against the wall. The look of utter shock on\nSadeas’s face amused a part of Adolin, the very small part that wasn’t\ncompletely, totally, and irrevocably enraged.\nHe squeezed, choking off a cry for help as he moved to pin Sadeas back"

But Sadeas was a\ntrained soldier. He tried to break the hold, taking Adolin by the arm and\ntwisting.\nAdolin kept hold, but lost his balance. The two of them fell in a jumble,\ntwisting, rolling. This wasn’t the calculated intensity of the dueling\ngrounds, or even the methodical butchery of the battlefield.\nThis was two sweating, straining men, both on the edge of panic. Adolin\nwas younger, but he was still bruised from the fight with the Assassin in\nWhite.\nHe managed to come up on top, and as Sadeas struggled to yell, Adolin\nslammed the man’s head down against the stone floor to daze him.\nBreathing in gasps, Adolin grabbed his side knife. He plunged the knife\ntoward Sadeas’s face, though the man managed to get his hands up to grab\nAdolin by the wrist.\nAdolin grunted, forcing the knife closer, clutched in his off hand. He\nbrought the right in anyway, the wrist flaring with pain, as he leaned it\nagainst the crossguard. Sweat prickled on Sadeas’s brow, the knife’s tip\ntouching the end of his left nostril.\n“My father,” Adolin said with a grunt, sweat from his nose dripping\ndown onto the blade of the knife, “thinks I’m a better man than he is.” He\nstrained, and felt Sadeas’s grip weaken. “Unfortunately for you, he’s\nwrong.”\nSadeas whimpered.\nWith a surge, Adolin forced the blade up past Sadeas’s nose and into the\neye socket—piercing the eye like a ripe berry—then rammed it home into\nthe brain.\nSadeas shook for a moment, blood pooling around the blade as Adolin\nworked it to be certain.\nA second later, a Shardblade appeared beside Sadeas—his father’s\nShardblade. Sadeas was dead.\nAdolin stumbled back to not get blood on his clothing, though his cuffs\nwere already stained. Storms. Had he just done that? Had he just murdered\na highprince?\nDazed, he stared at that weapon. Neither man had summoned his Blade\nfor the fight. The weapons might be worth a fortune, but they’d do less\ngood than a rock in such a close-quarters fight.\nThoughts coming more clearly, Adolin picked up the weapon and\nstumbled away. He ditched the Blade out a window, dropping it down into\none of the planterlike outcroppings of the terrace below. It might be safe\nthere.\nAfter that, he had the presence of mind to cut off his cuffs, remove his\nchalk mark on the wall by scraping it free with his own Blade, and walk as\nfar away as he could before finding one of his scouting parties and\npretending he’d been in that area all along.\n* * *\nDalinar finally figured out the locking mechanism, then pushed on the\nmetal door at the end of the stairwell.

He’d oiled the\nparts. Why wasn’t it moving?\nCrem, of course, he thought. He summoned his Shardblade and made a\nseries of quick cuts around the trapdoor. Then, with an effort, he was able to\nforce it to open. The ancient trapdoor swung upward and let him out onto\nthe very top of the tower city.\nHe smiled, stepping onto the roof. Five days of exploration had sent\nAdolin and Navani into the depths of the city-tower. Dalinar, however, had\nbeen driven to seek the top.\nFor such an enormous tower, the roof was actually relatively small, and\nnot that encrusted with crem. This high, less rain likely dropped during\nhighstorms—and everyone knew crem was thicker in the east than it was in\nthe west.\nStorms, this place was high. His ears had popped several times while\nriding to the top, using the fabrial lift that Navani had discovered. She\nspoke of counterweights and conjoined gemstones, sounding awed by the\ntechnology of the ancients. All he knew was that her discovery had let him\navoid climbing up some hundred flights of steps.\nHe stepped up to the edge and looked down. Below, each ring of the\ntower expanded out a little farther than the one above it. Shallan is right, he\nthought. They’re gardens. Each outer ring is dedicated to planting food. He\ndid not know why the eastern face of the tower was straight and sheer,\nfacing the Origin. No balconies along that side.\nHe leaned out. Distant, so far down it made him queasy, he picked out\nthe ten pillars that held the Oathgates. The one to the Shattered Plains\nflashed, and a large group of people appeared on it. They flew Hatham’s\nflag. With the maps Dalinar’s scholars had sent, it had only taken Hatham\nand the others about a week of quick marching to reach the Oathgate. When\nDalinar’s army had crossed that same distance, they’d done so very\ncautiously, wary of Parshendi attacks.\nNow that he saw those pillars from this perspective, he recognized that\nthere was one of them in Kholinar. It made up the dais upon which the\npalace and royal temple had been built. Shallan suspected that Jasnah had\ntried to open the Oathgate there; the woman’s notes said that Oathgates to\neach of the cities were locked tight. Only the one in the Shattered Plains had\nbeen left open.\nShallan hoped to figure out how to use the others, though their tests\nright now showed them to be locked somehow. If she managed to make\nthem work, the world would become a much, much smaller place.\nAssuming there was anything left of it.\nDalinar turned and looked upward, regarding the sky. He took a deep\nbreath. This was why he had come to the top.\n“You sent that storm to destroy us!” he shouted toward the clouds. “You\nsent it to cover up what Shallan, and then Kaladin, were becoming! You\ntried to end this before it could begin!”\nSilence.\n“Why send me visions and tell me to prepare!” Dalinar shouted. “Then"

THE ALMIGHTY DEMANDED IT OF ME. I COULD NO\nMORE DISOBEY THAN I COULD REFUSE TO BLOW THE WINDS.\nDalinar breathed in deeply. The Stormfather had replied. Blessedly, he\nhad replied.\n“The visions were his, then,” Dalinar said, “and you the vehicle for\nchoosing who received them?”\nYES.\n“Why did you pick me?” Dalinar demanded.\nIT DOES NOT MATTER. YOU WERE TOO SLOW. YOU FAILED.\nTHE EVERSTORM IS HERE, AND THE SPREN OF THE ENEMY\nCOME TO INHABIT THE ANCIENT ONES. IT IS OVER. YOU HAVE\nLOST.\n“You said that you were a fragment of the Almighty.”\nI AM HIS… SPREN, YOU MIGHT SAY. NOT HIS SOUL. I AM THE\nMEMORY MEN CREATE FOR HIM, NOW THAT HE IS GONE. THE\nPERSONIFICATION OF STORMS AND OF THE DIVINE. I AM NO\nGOD. I AM BUT A SHADOW OF ONE.\n“I’ll take what I can get.”\nHE WISHED FOR ME TO FIND YOU, BUT YOUR KIND HAVE\nBROUGHT ONLY DEATH TO MINE.\n“What do you know of this storm that the Parshendi unleashed?”\nTHE EVERSTORM. IT IS A NEW THING, BUT OLD OF DESIGN.\nIT ROUNDS THE WORLD NOW, AND CARRIES WITH IT HIS SPREN.\nANY OF THE OLD PEOPLE IT TOUCHES WILL TAKE ON THEIR\nNEW FORMS.\n“Voidbringers.”\nTHAT IS ONE TERM FOR THEM.\n“This Everstorm will come again, for certain?”\nREGULARLY, LIKE HIGHSTORMS, THOUGH LESS FREQUENT.\nYOU ARE DOOMED.\n“And it will transform the parshmen. Is there no way to stop it?”\nNO.\nDalinar closed his eyes. It was as he had feared. His army had defeated\nthe Parshendi, yes, but they were only a fraction of what was coming. Soon\nhe would face hundreds of thousands of them.\nThe other lands weren’t listening. He’d managed to speak, via spanreed,\nwith the emperor of Azir himself—a new emperor, as Szeth had visited the\nlast one. There had been no succession war in Azir, of course. Those\nrequired too much paperwork.\nThe new emperor had invited Dalinar to visit, but obviously considered\nhis words to be ravings. Dalinar hadn’t realized that rumors of his madness\nhad traveled so far. Even without that, however, he suspected his warnings\nwould be ignored, as the things he spoke of were insane. A storm that blew\nthe wrong way? Parshmen turning into Voidbringers?\nOnly Taravangian of Kharbranth—and now, apparently, Jah Keved—\nhad seemed willing to listen.

Dalinar had asked for more\ninformation about how he’d obtained that throne; initial reports indicated\nhe’d stumbled into the position unexpectedly. But he was too new, and Jah\nKeved too broken, for him to be able to do much.\nBeyond that, there were sudden and unexpected reports, coming via\nspanreed, of Kholinar rioting. No straight answers there yet, either. And\nwhat was this he heard of a plague in the Purelake? Storms, what a mess\nthis all had become.\nHe would need to do something about it. All of it.\nDalinar looked to the sky again. “I have been commanded to refound\nthe Knights Radiant. I will need to join their number if I am to lead them.”\nDistant thunder rumbled in the sky, though there were no clouds.\n“Life before death!” Dalinar shouted. “Strength before weakness!\nJourney before destination!”\nI AM THE SLIVER OF THE ALMIGHTY HIMSELF! the voice said,\nsounding angry. I AM THE STORMFATHER. I WILL NOT LET MYSELF\nBE BOUND IN SUCH A WAY AS TO KILL ME!\n“I need you,” Dalinar said. “Despite what you did. The bridgeman\nspoke of oaths given, and of each order of knights being different. The First\nIdeal is the same. After that, each order is unique, requiring different\nWords.”\nThe thunder rumbled. It sounded… like a challenge. Could Dalinar\ninterpret thunder now?\nThis was a dangerous gambit. He confronted something primal,\nsomething unknowable. Something that had actively tried to murder him\nand his entire army.\n“Fortunately,” Dalinar said, “I know the second oath I am to make. I\ndon’t need to be told it. I will unite instead of divide, Stormfather. I will\nbring men together.”\nThe thunder silenced. Dalinar stood alone, staring at the sky, waiting.\nVERY WELL, the Stormfather finally said. THESE WORDS ARE\nACCEPTED.\nDalinar smiled.\nI WILL NOT BE A SIMPLE SWORD TO YOU, the Stormfather\nwarned. I WILL NOT COME AS YOU CALL, AND YOU WILL HAVE\nTO DIVEST YOURSELF OF THAT… MONSTROSITY THAT YOU\nCARRY. YOU WILL BE A RADIANT WITH NO SHARDS.\n“It will be what it must,” Dalinar said, summoning his Shardblade. As\nsoon as it appeared, screams sounded in his head. He dropped the weapon\nas if it were an eel that had snapped at him. The screams vanished\nimmediately.\nThe Blade clanged to the ground. Unbonding a Shardblade was\nsupposed to be a difficult process, requiring concentration and touching its\nstone. Yet this one was severed from him in an instant. He could feel it.\n“What was the meaning of the last vision I received?” Dalinar said.\n“The one this morning, that came with no highstorm.”\nNO VISION WAS SENT THIS MORNING.\n“Yes it was. I saw light and warmth.”\nA SIMPLE DREAM. NOT OF ME, NOR OF GODS.\nCurious. Dalinar could have sworn it felt the same way as the visions, if\nnot stronger.\nGO, BONDSMITH, the Stormfather said.

YOU ARE NOTHING TO HIM.\n“The Almighty could die,” Dalinar said. “If that is true, then this Odium\ncan be killed. I will find a way to do it. The visions mentioned a challenge,\na champion. Do you know anything of this?”\nThe sky gave no reply beyond a simple rumble. Well, there would be\ntime for more questions later.\nDalinar walked down off the top of Urithiru and entered the stairwell\nagain. The flight of steps opened into a room that encompassed nearly the\nentire top floor of the tower city, and it shone with light through glass\nwindows. Glass with no shutters or support, some of it facing east. How it\nsurvived highstorms Dalinar did not know, though lines of crem did streak\nit in places.\nTen short pillars ringed this room, with another at the center. “Well?”\nKaladin asked, turning away from an inspection of one of them. Shallan\nrounded another; she looked far less ragged than she had when they’d first\ncome to the city. Though their days here in Urithiru had been frantic, some\ngood nights’ sleep had served them all quite well.\nIn response to the question, Dalinar took a sphere from his pocket and\nheld it up. Then he sucked in the Stormlight.\nHe knew to expect the feeling of a storm raging inside, as both Kaladin\nand Shallan had described it to him. It urged him to act, to move, to not\nstand still. It did not, however, feel like the Thrill of battle—which was\nwhat he had anticipated.\nHe felt his wounds healing in a familiar way. He’d done this before, he\nsensed. On the battlefield earlier? His arm felt fine now, and the cut on his\nside barely ached anymore.\n“It’s horribly unfair you managed that on your first try,” Kaladin noted.\n“It took me forever.”\n“I had instruction,” Dalinar said, walking into the room and tucking the\nsphere away. “The Stormfather called me Bondsmith.”\n“It was the name of one of the orders,” Shallan said, resting her fingers\non one of the pillars. “That makes three of us. Windrunner, Bondsmith,\nLightweaver.”\n“Four,” a voice said from the shadows of the stairwell. Renarin stepped\nup into the lit room. He looked at them, then shrank back.\n“Son?” Dalinar asked.\nRenarin remained in the darkness, looking down.\n“No spectacles…” Dalinar whispered. “You stopped wearing them. I\nthought you were trying to look like a warrior, but no. Stormlight healed\nyour eyes.”\nRenarin nodded.\n“And the Shardblade,” Dalinar said, stepping over and taking his son by\nthe shoulder. “You hear screams. That’s what happened to you in the arena.\nYou couldn’t fight because of those shouts in your head from summoning\nthe Blade. Why? Why didn’t you say anything?”\n“I thought it was me,” Renarin whispered. “My mind. But Glys, he\nsays…” Renarin blinked. “Truthwatcher.”\n“Truthwatcher?” Kaladin said, glancing at Shallan. She shook her head."

What\ndo you do?”\nRenarin met Kaladin’s eyes across the room. “I see.”\n“Four orders,” Dalinar said, squeezing Renarin’s shoulder with pride.\nStorms, the lad was trembling. What made him so worried? Dalinar turned\nto the others. “The other orders must be returning as well. We need to find\nthose whom the spren have chosen. Quickly, for the Everstorm is upon us,\nand it is worse than we feared.”\n“How?” Shallan asked.\n“It will change the parshmen,” Dalinar said. “The Stormfather\nconfirmed it to me. When that storm hits it will bring back the\nVoidbringers.”\n“Damnation,” Kaladin said. “I need to get to Alethkar, to Hearthstone.”\nHe strode toward the exit.\n“Soldier?” Dalinar called. “I’ve done what I can to warn our people.”\n“My parents are back there,” Kaladin said. “And the citylord of my\ntown has parshmen. I’m going.”\n“How?” Shallan asked. “You’ll fly the entire distance?”\n“Fall,” Kaladin said. “But yes.” He paused at the doorway out.\n“How much Light will that take, son?” Dalinar asked.\n“I don’t know,” Kaladin admitted. “A lot, probably.”\nShallan looked to Dalinar. They didn’t have Stormlight to spare. Though\nthose from the warcamps brought recharged spheres, activating the\nOathgate took a great deal of Stormlight, depending on how many people\nwere brought. Lighting the lamps in the room at the center of the Oathgate\nwas merely the minimum amount needed to start the device—bringing\nmany people partially drained the infused gemstones they carried as well.\n“I will get you what I can, lad,” Dalinar said. “Go with my blessing.\nPerhaps you will have enough left over to get to the capital afterward and\nhelp the people there.”\nKaladin nodded. “I’ll put together a pack. I need to leave within the\nhour.” He ducked from the room into the stairwell down.\nDalinar sucked in more Stormlight, and felt the last of his wounds\nretreat. This seemed a thing a man could easily grow accustomed to having.\nHe sent Renarin with orders to speak with the king and requisition some\nemerald broams that Kaladin could borrow for his trip. Elhokar had finally\narrived, in the company of a group of Herdazians, of all things. One\nclaiming his name needed to be added to the lists of Alethi kings…\nRenarin went eagerly to obey the order. He seemed to want something\nhe could do.\nHe’s one of the Knights Radiant, Dalinar thought, watching him go. I’ll\nprobably need to stop sending him on errands.\nStorms. It was really happening.\nShallan had walked to the windows. Dalinar stepped up beside her. This\nwas the eastern face of the tower, the flat edge that looked directly toward\nthe Origin.\n“Kaladin will only have time to save a few,” Shallan said. “If that many."

That was also the obvious joke, however, so shame\non you.”\nThe ugly lizard-crab-thing scuttled across its rock, moving onto the\nother side. Wit sighed. It was night, which was normally a good time for\ndramatic arrivals and meaningful philosophy. Unfortunately for him, there\nwas nobody here upon which to philosophize or visit, dramatically or\notherwise. A small river gurgled nearby, one of the few permanent\nwaterways in this strange land. Extending in all directions were rolling hills,\nfurrowed by passing water and grown over in the valleys with an odd kind\nof briar. Very few trees here, though farther west a true forest sprouted on\nthe slopes down from the heights.\nA couple of songlings made rattling sounds nearby, and he took out his\npipes and tried to imitate them. He couldn’t, not exactly. The singing sounds\nwere too like percussion, a zipping rattle—musical, but not flute-like.\nStill, the creatures seemed to alternate with him, responding to his\nmusic. Who knew? Maybe the things had a rudimentary intelligence. Those\nhorses, the Ryshadium… those had surprised him. He was glad that there\nwere still some things that could do that.\nHe finally set down his pipes and contemplated. An audience of ugly\nlizard-crab-things and songlings was some audience, at least.\n“Art,” he said, “is fundamentally unfair.”\nOne songling continued to creak.\n“You see, we pretend that art is eternal, that there is some kind of\npersistence to it. A Truth, you might say. Art is art because it is art and not\nbecause we say that it is art. I’m not going too quickly for you, am I?”\nCreak.\n“Good. But if art is eternal and meaningful and independent, why does\nit depend so damn much upon the audience? You’ve heard the story about\nthe farmer visiting court during the Festival of Depiction, right?”\nCreak?\n“Oh, it’s not that great a story. Utterly disposable. Standard beginning,"

Standard beginning,\nthe farmer who visits the big city, does something embarrassing, stumbles\ninto the princess and—completely by accident—saves her from getting\ntrampled. Princesses in these stories never do seem to be able to look where\nthey are going. I think perhaps more of them should inquire with a\nreputable lensmaker and procure a suitable set of spectacles before\nattempting any further traversal of thoroughfares.\n“Anyway, as this story is a comedy, the man is invited to the palace for\na reward. Various nonsense follows, ending with the poor farmer wiping\nhimself in the privy with one of the finest paintings ever painted, then\nstrolling out to find all of the lighteyes staring at an empty frame and\ncommenting on how beautiful the work is. Mirth and guffaws. Flourish and\nbow. Exit before anyone thinks too much about the tale.”\nHe waited.\nCreak?\n“Well, don’t you see?” Wit said. “The farmer found the painting near\nthe privy, so assumed it was to be used for such a purpose. The lighteyes\nfound the empty frame in the hall of art, and assumed it to be a masterwork.\nYou may call this a silly story. It is. That does not depreciate its\ntruthfulness. After all, I am frequently quite silly—but I am almost always\ntruthful. Force of habit.\n“Expectation. That is the true soul of art. If you can give a man more\nthan he expects, then he will laud you his entire life. If you can create an air\nof anticipation and feed it properly, you will succeed.\n“Conversely, if you gain a reputation for being too good, too skilled…\nbeware. The better art will be in their heads, and if you give them an ounce\nless than they imagined, suddenly you have failed. Suddenly you are\nuseless. A man will find a single coin in the mud and talk about it for days,\nbut when his inheritance comes and is accounted one percent less than he\nexpected, then he will declare himself cheated.”\nWit shook his head, standing up and dusting off his coat. “Give me an\naudience who have come to be entertained, but who expect nothing special.\nTo them, I will be a god. That is the best truth I know.”\nSilence.\n“I could use a little music,” he said. “For dramatic effect, you see.\nSomeone is coming, and I want to be prepared to welcome them.”\nThe songling, obligingly, started its music again. Wit took a deep breath,\nthen struck the appropriate pose—lazy expectation, calculated\nknowingness, insufferable conceit. After all, he did have a reputation, so he\nmight as well try to live up to it.\nThe air in front of him blurred, as if heated in a ring near the ground. A\nstreak of light spun about the ring, forming a wall five or six feet high. It\nfaded immediately—really, it was just an afterimage, as if something\nglowing had spun in the circle very quickly.\nIn the center of it appeared Jasnah Kholin, standing tall.\nHer clothing was ragged, her hair formed into a single utilitarian braid,"

She’d once worn a fine dress, but that was\ntattered. She’d hemmed it at the knees and had sewn herself a glove out of\nsomething improvised. Curiously, she wore a kind of leather bandolier and\na backpack. He doubted she’d had either one when her journey had begun.\nShe groaned a long groan, then looked to the side, where Wit stood.\nHe grinned at her.\nShe stabbed her hand out in the blink of an eye, mist twisting around her\narm and snapping into the form of a long, thin sword pointed at Wit’s neck.\nHe cocked an eyebrow.\n“How did you find me?” she asked.\n“You’ve been making quite a disturbance on the other side,” Wit said.\n“It’s been a long time since the spren had to deal with someone alive,\nparticularly someone so demanding as yourself.”\nShe hissed out a breath, then pushed the Shardblade closer. “Tell me\nwhat you know, Wit.”\n“I once spent the better part of a year inside of a large stomach, being\ndigested.”\nShe frowned at him.\n“That is a thing that I know. You really should be more specific in your\nthreats.” He looked down as she twisted her Shardblade, rotating the tip,\nstill pointed at him. “I’d be surprised if that little knife of yours poses me\nany real threat, Kholin. You can keep waving it about if you want, though.\nPerhaps it makes you feel more important.”\nShe studied him. Then the sword burst to mist, vaporizing. She lowered\nher arm. “I don’t have time for you. A storm is coming, a terrible storm. It\nwill bring the Voidbringers to—”\n“Already here.”\n“Damnation. We need to find Urithiru and—”\n“Already found.”\nShe hesitated. “The Knights—”\n“Refounded,” Wit said. “In part by your apprentice who, I might add, is\nexactly seventy-seven percent more agreeable than you are. I took a poll.”\n“You’re lying.”\n“Okay, so it was a rather informal poll. But the ugly lizard-crab-thing\ngave you really poor marks for—”\n“About the other things.”\n“I don’t tell those kinds of lies, Jasnah. You know that. It’s what you\nfind so annoying about me.”\nShe inspected him, then sighed. “It is part of what I find so annoying\nabout you, Wit. Only a very small part of a vast, vast river.”\n“You only say that because you don’t know me very well.”\n“Doubtful.”\n“No, really. If you did know me, that river of annoyance would be an\nocean, obviously. Regardless. I know things that you do not, and I think you\nmight actually know some that I do not. That gives us what is called\nsynergy. If you can contain your annoyance, we might both learn\nsomething.”\nShe looked him up and down, then drew her lips to a line and nodded.\nShe started walking directly toward the nearest town. She had a good sense\nof direction, this woman."

She had a good sense\nof direction, this woman.\nWit strolled up beside her. “You realize we’re at least a week away from\ncivilization. Did you need to Elsecall this far out in the middle of\nnowhere?”\n“I was somewhat pressed at the time of my escape. I’m lucky to be here\nat all.”\n“Lucky? I don’t know if I’d say that.”\n“Why?”\n“You’d likely be better off on the other side, Jasnah Kholin. The\nDesolation has come, and with it, the end of this land.” He looked at her.\n“I’m sorry.”\n“Don’t be sorry,” she said, “until we see how much I can salvage. The\nstorm has come already? The parshmen have transformed?”\n“Yes and no,” Wit said. “The storm should hit Shinovar tonight, then\nwork its way across the land. I believe that the storm will bring the\ntransformation.”\nJasnah stopped in place. “That’s not how it happened in the past. I have\nlearned things on the other side.”\n“You are correct. It is different this time.”\nShe licked her lips, but otherwise did a good job containing her anxiety.\n“If it’s not happening as it did before, then everything I know could be\nfalse. The words of the highspren could be inaccurate. The records I seek\ncould be meaningless.”\nHe nodded.\n“We can’t depend upon the ancient writings,” she said. “And the\nsupposed god of men is a fabrication. So we can’t look to the heavens for\nsalvation, but apparently we can’t look toward the past either. So where can\nwe look?”\n“You’re so convinced that there is no God.”\n“The Almighty is—”\n“Oh,” Wit said, “I don’t mean the Almighty. Tanavast was a fine enough\nfellow—bought me drinks once—but he was not God. I’ll admit, Jasnah,\nthat I empathize with your skepticism, but I don’t agree with it. I just think\nyou’ve been looking for God in the wrong places.”\n“I suppose that you’re going to tell me where you think I should look.”\n“You’ll find God in the same place you’re going to find salvation from\nthis mess,” Wit said. “Inside the hearts of men.”\n“Curiously,” Jasnah said, “I believe I can actually agree with that,\nthough I suspect for different reasons than you imply. Perhaps this walk\nwon’t be as bad as I had feared.”\n“Perhaps,” he said, looking up toward the stars. “Whatever else might\nbe said, at least the world chose a nice night upon which to end…”\nTHE END OF\nBook Two of\nTHE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE\nEndnote\nARS ARCANUM\nTHE TEN ESSENCES AND THEIR HISTORICAL\nASSOCIATIONS\nThe preceding list is an imperfect gathering of traditional Vorin\nsymbolism associated with the Ten Essences.

        "text": "creation of plants and creatures. This is also the basis for the hourglass\nshape that was often associated with the Knights Radiant.\nAncient scholars also placed the ten orders of Knights Radiant on this\nlist, alongside the Heralds themselves, who each had a classical association\nwith one of the numbers and Essences.\nI’m not certain yet how the ten levels of Voidbinding or its cousin the\nOld Magic fit into this paradigm, if indeed they can. My research suggests\nthat, indeed, there should be another series of abilities that is even more\nesoteric than the Voidbindings. Perhaps the Old Magic fits into those,\nthough I am beginning to suspect that it is something entirely different.\nNote that I currently believe the concept of the “Body Focus” to be\nmore a matter of philosophical interpretation than an actual attribute of this\nInvestiture and its manifestations.\nTHE TEN SURGES\nAs a complement to the Essences, the classical elements celebrated on\nRoshar, are found the Ten Surges. These—thought to be the fundamental\nforces by which the world operates—are more accurately a representation\nof the ten basic abilities offered to the Heralds, and then the Knights\nRadiant, by their bonds.\nAdhesion: The Surge of Pressure and Vacuum\nGravitation: The Surge of Gravity\nDivision: The Surge of Destruction and Decay\nAbrasion: The Surge of Friction\nProgression: The Surge of Growth and Healing, or Regrowth\nIllumination: The Surge of Light, Sound, and Various Waveforms\nTransformation: The Surge of Soulcasting\nTransportation: The Surge of Motion and Realmatic Transition\nCohesion: The Surge of Strong Axial Interconnection\nTension: The Surge of Soft Axial Interconnection\nON THE CREATION OF FABRIALS\nFive groupings of fabrial have been discovered so far. The methods of\ntheir creation are carefully guarded by the artifabrian community, but they\nappear to be the work of dedicated scientists, as opposed to the more\nmystical Surgebindings once performed by the Knights Radiant. I am more\nand more convinced that the creation of these devices requires forced\nenslavement of transformative cognitive entities, known as “spren” to the\nlocal communities.\nALTERING FABRIALS\nAugmenters: These fabrials are crafted to enhance something. They can\ncreate heat, pain, or even a calm wind, for instance. They are powered—like\nall fabrials—by Stormlight. They seem to work best with forces, emotions,\nor sensations.\nThe so-called half-shards of Jah Keved are created with this type of\nfabrial attached to a sheet of metal, enhancing its durability. I have seen\nfabrials of this type crafted using many different kinds of gemstone; I am\nguessing that any one of the ten Polestones will work.\nDiminishers: These fabrials do the opposite of what augmenters do, and\ngenerally seem to fall under the same restrictions as their cousins. Those\nartifabrians who have taken me into confidence seem to believe that even\ngreater fabrials are possible than what have been created so far, particularly\nin regard to augmenters and diminishers.\nPAIRING FABRIALS\nConjoiners: By infusing a ruby and using methodology that has not\nbeen revealed to me (though I have my suspicions), you can create a\nconjoined pair of gemstones.

        "text": "Conjoiners: By infusing a ruby and using methodology that has not\nbeen revealed to me (though I have my suspicions), you can create a\nconjoined pair of gemstones. The process requires splitting the original\nruby. The two halves will then create parallel reactions across a distance.\nSpanreeds are one of the most common forms of this type of fabrial.\nConservation of force is maintained; for instance, if one is attached to a\nheavy stone, you will need the same strength to lift the conjoined fabrial\nthat you would need to lift the stone itself. There appears to be some sort of\nprocess used during the creation of the fabrial that influences how far apart\nthe two halves can go and still produce an effect.\nReversers: Using an amethyst instead of a ruby also creates conjoined\nhalves of a gemstone, but these two work in creating opposite reactions.\nRaise one, and the other will be pressed downward, for instance.\nThese fabrials have only just been discovered, and already the\npossibilities for exploitation are being conjectured. There appear to be some\nunexpected limitations to this form of fabrial, though I have not been able\nto discover what they are.\nWARNING FABRIALS\nThere is only one type of fabrial in this set, informally known as the\nAlerter. An Alerter can warn one of a nearby object, feeling, sensation, or\nphenomenon. These fabrials use a heliodor stone as their focus. I do not\nknow whether this is the only type of gemstone that will work, or if there is\nanother reason heliodor is used.\nIn the case of this kind of fabrial, the amount of Stormlight you can\ninfuse into it affects its range. Hence the size of gemstone used is very\nimportant.\nWINDRUNNING AND LASHINGS\nReports of the Assassin in White’s odd abilities have led me to some\nsources of information that, I believe, are generally unknown. The\nWindrunners were an order of the Knights Radiant, and they made use of\ntwo primary types of Surgebinding. The effects of these Surgebindings were\nknown—colloquially among the members of the order—as the Three\nLashings.\nBASIC LASHING: GRAVITATIONAL CHANGE\nThis type of Lashing was one of the most commonly used Lashings\namong the order, though it was not the easiest to use. (That distinction\nbelongs to the Full Lashing below.) A Basic Lashing involved revoking a\nbeing’s or object’s spiritual gravitational bond to the planet below, instead\ntemporarily linking that being or object to a different object or direction.\nEffectively, this creates a change in gravitational pull, twisting the\nenergies of the planet itself. A Basic Lashing allowed a Windrunner to run\nup walls, to send objects or people flying off into the air, or to create similar\neffects. Advanced uses of this type of Lashing would allow a Windrunner to\nmake himself or herself lighter by binding part of his or her mass upward.\n(Mathematically, binding a quarter of one’s mass upward would halve a\nperson’s effective weight. Binding half of one’s mass upward would create\nweightlessness.)\nMultiple Basic Lashings could also pull an object or a person’s body\ndownward at double, triple, or other multiples of its weight.\nFULL LASHING: BINDING OBJECTS TOGETHER"

        "text": "weightlessness.)\nMultiple Basic Lashings could also pull an object or a person’s body\ndownward at double, triple, or other multiples of its weight.\nFULL LASHING: BINDING OBJECTS TOGETHER\nA Full Lashing might seem very similar to a Basic Lashing, but they\nworked on very different principles. While one had to do with gravitation,\nthe other had to do with the force (or Surge, as the Radiants called them) of\nAdhesion—binding objects together as if they were one. I believe this Surge\nmay have had something to do with atmospheric pressure.\nTo create a Full Lashing, a Windrunner would infuse an object with\nStormlight, then press another object to it. The two objects would become\nbound together with an extremely powerful bond, nearly impossible to\nbreak. In fact, most materials would themselves break before the bond\nholding them together would.\nREVERSE LASHING: GIVING AN OBJECT A\nGRAVITATIONAL PULL\nI believe this may actually be a specialized version of the Basic\nLashing. This type of Lashing required the least amount of Stormlight of\nany of the three Lashings. The Windrunner would infuse something, give a\nmental command, and create a pull to the object that yanked other objects\ntoward it.\nAt its heart, this Lashing created a bubble around the object that\nimitated its spiritual link to the ground beneath it. As such, it was much\nharder for the Lashing to affect objects touching the ground, where their\nlink to the planet was strongest. Objects falling or in flight were the easiest\nto influence. Other objects could be affected, but the Stormlight and skill\nrequired were much more substantial.\nLIGHTWEAVING\nA second form of Surgebinding involves the manipulation of light and\nsound in illusory tactics common throughout the cosmere. Unlike the\nvariations present on Sel, however, this method has a powerful Spiritual\nelement, requiring not just a full mental picture of the intended creation, but\nsome level of connection to it as well. The illusion is based not simply upon\nwhat the Lightweaver imagines, but upon what they desire to create.\nIn many ways, this is the most similar ability to the original Yolish\nvariant, which excites me. I wish to delve more into this ability, with the\nhope to gain a full understanding of how it relates to Cognitive and Spiritual\nattributes."
