It’s been ten years now since I began this series, and it has been an\nincreasingly satisfying experience to see the story grow and fulfill the vision\nI’ve had for it all these years. In particular, one scene at the end of this book\nis among the very first I ever imagined for the series, over twenty years ago!\nWe are approaching the last book of this sequence of the Stormlight\nArchive. (I imagine the series as two sets of five books, with two major\narcs.) Thank you for sticking with me all these years! My goal is to keep\ndelivering these in a timely manner. And as always, deadlines for this one\nwere tight, and a lot of people put in a lot of hours to bring it to pass. This\nlist will be a little long, but each and every one of them deserves to be\ncommended for their efforts.\nAt Tor Books, my primary editor on this novel was Devi Pillai, and she\nwas tireless, punctual, and a wonderful advocate for the Stormlight Archive.\nThis is my first Cosmere book that wasn’t done with my longtime editor\nMoshe Feder, who still deserves a great deal of thanks for shepherding this\nseries during its early years. But I want to give a special thanks to Devi for\nhelping make this transition smooth and easy.\nAs always, thanks go to Tom Doherty, who gave me my first chance in\npublishing. Devi and Tom’s team at Tor who worked on this book with us\ninclude Rachel Bass, Peter Lutjen, Rafal Gibek, and Heather Saunders.\nAt Gollancz, my UK publisher, I want to give special thanks to Gillian\nRedfearn who provides editorial support through the entire process, and\nwho also works very hard to make the books look great.\nOur copyeditor was the always-great Terry McGarry, and joining us for\nthe first time as a line editor was Kristina Kugler. I’ve wanted to work with\nKristina for a long time on a Cosmere book, and she did an excellent job\nwith this one.\nFor the audio book, Steve Wagner was our producer.

        "text": "with this one.\nFor the audio book, Steve Wagner was our producer. And returning to\nthe series are the excellent Michael Kramer and Kate Reading, the best\naudio narrators in the world. They have my hearty thanks for continuing to\nhumor us by taking on these fifty-plus-hour beasts of an epic fantasy series.\nMy primary agent for this book was JABberwocky Literary Agency,\nwith Joshua Bilmes at the helm. Assisting him were Susan Velazquez,\nKaren Bourne, and Valentina Sainato. Our UK agent is John Berlyne at the\nZeno Literary Agency. I continue to be grateful for their work and advocacy\non my behalf.\nAt my own company, Dragonsteel Entertainment, we have my wonderful\nwife Emily Sanderson as our manager. The Ineffable Peter Ahlstrom is our\nvice president and editorial director, and Isaac Stewart is our Art Director.\nNormally I do something silly with his name, but considering that this book\nis dedicated to him, I figured I’d let him off this time. Isaac not only is the\none who creates our beautiful maps, but is the person who introduced me to\nmy wife. (On a blind date, no less.) So if you ever get a chance to meet him,\nhave him sign your copy of this book, and be sure to swap stories with him\nabout your favorite LEGO sets.\nAlso at Dragonsteel Entertainment are Karen Ahlstrom, our continuity\neditor, and Kara Stewart, our warehouse manager and CFO. Adam Horne is\nmy in-house publicist, personal assistant, and all around “I can do that” guy\nwho gets things done. Our other store employees include Kathleen Dorsey\nSanderson, Emily “Mem” Grange, Lex Willhite, and Michael Bateman.\nThey’re the ones who get you your T-shirts, posters, and signed books.\nTheir assistants, the “mini minions” of our team, include: Jacob, Hazel,\nIsabel, Matthew, Audrey, Tori, and Joe. Additionally, thanks to all those\nwho volunteer, especially to the always awesome Christi Jacobson.\nThe artists who contributed to Rhythm of War braved not only pandemic\nand tragedy during the completion of the art, some even braved literal\nstorms to deliver it. I’m in awe of their talent and commitment, and to all of\nthem I not only give my heartfelt thanks, but I also wish them peace\nthrough the turbulent times they’ve faced.\nOne of the highlights of my career is getting to work with Michael\nWhelan. I’m humbled that he is so supportive of the books that he sets aside\npersonal projects for a time to create the beautiful paintings he’s done for\nthe series. I would have been grateful for just one of his cover illustrations,\nso I feel incredibly lucky that he continues to work his magic for Rhythm of\nWar, producing what I think is the best Stormlight cover so far. It’s without\na doubt a masterpiece, and I am in awe of it.\nIn Oathbringer, we printed portraits of the Heralds on the front and back\nendpapers, and we continue that tradition here. Early in the writing process\nfor this book, we commissioned the remaining six Heralds, knowing that\ntwo of them would have to be saved for a future book. Each artist stepped\nup to the task and provided masterpieces. Donato’s Herald Talenelat is\ncareworn yet triumphant, and I’m thrilled to have his beautiful vision of this"

Miranda Meeks is no stranger to the Stormlight Archive—we\nlove getting to work with her any chance we have—and her Herald Battah\nis regal and mysterious. Karla Ortiz, whose work I’ve been a fan of for\nsome time, has given us glorious and nigh-on-perfect visions of Heralds\nChanaranach and Nalan. Lastly, Magali Villeneuve’s Heralds Pailiah and\nKelek are stunning and wonderful. Howard Lyon collaborated with her to\npaint amazing oil versions of these last two, which will eventually be\ndisplayed with the others.\nDan dos Santos is a living legend and a good friend. He brings his\nsignature style to the fashion plates in this volume, tackling the difficult\nchallenge of portraying the singers as alien but also in a way that readers\ncan identify with them emotionally. I think he’s done a fantastic job walking\nthat line.\nBen McSweeney joined the Dragonsteel team full time this year, and the\nbook showcases some of his best art. Shallan’s spren pages especially\ncontinue to help fill out the visual aesthetic of Roshar. I love how Ben’s\npiece detailing Urithiru’s atrium helps convey the immensity of the city;\nspecial thanks here to Alex Schneider, who consulted on some of the\narchitectural layout.\nA great big thanks to Kelley Harris, a core member of our Stormlight\nteam who always brings Navani’s notebook pages to life with an\nimpeccable design sense that reminds me of Alphonse Mucha’s product\ndesigns from the early twentieth century.\nAdditionally, many artists and others helped behind the scenes on this\nbook and deserve a huge thank-you: Miranda Meeks, Howard Lyon, Shawn\nBoyles, Cori Boyles, Jacob, Isabel, Rachel, Sophie, and Hayley Lazo.\nWe had a few very important subject experts help us with this book.\nShad “Shadiversity” Brooks was our primary historical martial arts\nconsultant. Carl Fisk also lent us some of his expertise in this area—though\nif I got something wrong, it’s not their fault. It’s almost assuredly something\nI either didn’t show them on time, or forgot to change.\nOur expert on Dissociative Identity Disorder was Britt Martin. I truly\nappreciate her willing to give me raw feedback on how to get better at how\nI represent mental illness in these books. She was our secret Knight Radiant\nfor this novel, always there urging me forward.\nSpecial thanks go to four of the beta readers in particular, for their\ndetailed feedback on a certain aspect of sexuality: Paige Phillips, Alyx\nHoge, Blue, and First Last. The book is better off with your contribution.\nOur writing group on this book was Kaylynn ZoBell, Kathleen Dorsey\nSanderson, Eric James Stone, Darci Stone, Alan Layton, Ben “can you\nplease just spell my name right for once, Brandon” Olzedixploxipllentivar,\nEthan Skarstedt, Karen Ahlstrom, Peter Ahlstrom, Emily Sanderson, and\nHoward Tayler.

And a better group of merry men/women you will not find.\nThey read huge chunks of this book each week, and dealt with me making\nconstant and enormous changes, in order to help me get the novel into\nshape.\nOur expert team of beta readers this time included Brian T.

These folks have to read the book often under a great time crunch,\nand they have to experience it in an unfinished form. In a lot of ways,\nthey’re giving up the chance to experience the book in its best form, getting\nan inferior experience, so they can make the book better for the rest of you.\nI appreciate their tireless work, and their feedback. This book is much better\nfor their efforts.\nThat was a huge list, I know. It gets bigger in each book! But I sincerely\nappreciate every one of them.

As I often say, my name goes on the cover,\nbut these novels really are a group effort, using the talents and knowledge\nof a great array of dedicated people.\nBecause of them, you can now experience Rhythm of War, Book Four of\nthe Stormlight Archive. May you enjoy the journey.\nSEVEN YEARS AGO\nOf course the Parshendi wanted to play their drums.\nOf course Gavilar had told them they could.\nAnd of course he hadn’t thought to warn Navani.\n“Have you seen the size of those instruments?” Maratham said, running\nher hands through her black hair. “Where will we put them? And we’re\nalready at capacity after your husband invited all the foreign dignitaries. We\ncan’t—”\n“We’ll set up a more exclusive feast in the upper ballroom,” Navani said,\nmaintaining a calm demeanor, “and put the drums there, with the king’s\ntable.”\nEveryone else in the kitchens was close to panicking, assistant cooks\nrunning one direction or another, pots banging, anticipationspren shooting\nup from the ground like streamers. Gavilar had invited not only the\nhighprinces, but their relatives. And every highlord in the city. And he\nwanted a double-sized Beggar’s Feast. And now … drums?\n“We’ve already put everyone to work in the lower feast hall!” Maratham\ncried. “I don’t have the staff to set up—”\n“There are twice as many soldiers as usual loitering around the palace\ntonight,” Navani said. “We’ll have them help you set up.” Posting extra\nguards, making a show of force? Gavilar could always be counted on to do\nthat.\nFor everything else, he had Navani.\n“Could work, yes,” Maratham said. “Good to put the louts to work rather\nthan having them underfoot. We have two main feasts, then? All right. Deep\nbreaths.” The short palace organizer scuttled away, narrowly avoiding an\napprentice cook carrying a large bowl of steaming shellfish.\nNavani stepped aside to let the cook pass. The man nodded in thanks; the\nstaff had long since stopped being nervous when she entered the kitchens.\nShe’d made it clear to them that doing their jobs efficiently was recognition\nenough.\nDespite the underlying tension, they seemed to have things well in hand\nnow—though there had been a scare earlier when they’d found worms in\nthree barrels of grain. Thankfully, Brightlord Amaram had stores for his\nmen, and Navani had been able to pry them out of his grip. For now, with\nthe extra cooks they’d borrowed from the monastery, they might actually be\nable to feed all the people Gavilar had invited.\nI’ll have to give instructions on who is to be seated in which feast room,\nshe thought, slipping out of the kitchens and into the palace gardens. And\nleave some extra space in both. Who knows who else might show up with an\ninvitation?\nShe hiked up through the gardens toward the side doors of the palace.\nShe’d be less in the way—and wouldn’t have to dodge servants—if she\ntook this path. As she walked, she scanned to make certain all the lanterns\nwere in place. Though the sun hadn’t yet set, she wanted the Kholinar\npalace to shine brightly tonight."

        "text": "took this path. As she walked, she scanned to make certain all the lanterns\nwere in place. Though the sun hadn’t yet set, she wanted the Kholinar\npalace to shine brightly tonight.\nWait. Was that Aesudan—her daughter-in-law, Elhokar’s wife—standing\nnear the fountains? She was supposed to be greeting guests inside. The\nslender woman wore her long hair in a bun lit by a gemstone of each shade.\nAll those colors were gaudy together—Navani preferred a few simple\nstones themed to one color—but it did make Aesudan stand out as she\nchatted with two elderly ardents.\nStorms bright and brash … that was Rushur Kris, the artist and master\nartifabrian. When had he arrived? Who had invited him? He was holding a\nsmall box with a flower painted on it. Could that be … one of his new\nfabrials?\nNavani felt drawn toward the group, all other thoughts fleeing her mind.\nHow had he made the heating fabrial, making the temperature vary? She’d\nseen drawings, but to talk to the master artist himself …\nAesudan saw Navani and smiled brightly. The joy seemed genuine,\nwhich was unusual—at least when directed at Navani. She tried not to take\nAesudan’s general sourness toward her as a personal affront; it was the\nprerogative of every woman to feel threatened by her mother-in-law.\nParticularly when the girl was so obviously lacking in talents.\nNavani smiled at her in turn, trying to enter the conversation and get a\nbetter look at that box. Aesudan, however, took Navani by the arm.\n“Mother! I had completely forgotten about our appointment. I’m so fickle\nsometimes. Terribly sorry, Ardent Kris, but I must make a hasty exit.”\nAesudan tugged Navani—forcefully—back through the gardens toward\nthe kitchens. “Thank Kelek you showed up, Mother. That man is the most\ndreadful bore.”\n“Bore?” Navani said, twisting to gaze over her shoulder. “He was talking\nabout…”\n“Gemstones. And other gemstones. And spren and boxes of spren, and\nstorms! You’d think he would understand. I have important people to meet.\nThe wives of highprinces, the best generals in the land, all come to gawk at\nthe wild parshmen. Then I get stuck in the gardens talking to ardents? Your\nson abandoned me there, I’ll have you know. When I find that man…”\nNavani extricated herself from Aesudan’s grip. “Someone should\nentertain those ardents. Why are they here?”\n“Don’t ask me,” Aesudan said. “Gavilar wanted them for something, but\nhe made Elhokar entertain them. Poor manners, that is. Honestly!”\nGavilar had invited one of the world’s most prominent artifabrians to\nvisit Kholinar, and he hadn’t bothered to tell Navani? Emotion stirred deep\ninside her, a fury she kept carefully penned and locked away. That man.\nThat storming man.

How … how could he …\nAngerspren, like boiling blood, began to well up in a small pool at her\nfeet. Calm, Navani, the rational side of her mind said. Maybe he intends to\nintroduce the ardent to you as a gift. She banished the anger with effort.\n“Brightness!” a voice called from the kitchens. “Brightness Navani! Oh,\nplease! We have a problem.”\n“Aesudan,” Navani said, her eyes still on the ardent, who was now\nslowly walking toward the monastery. “Could you help the kitchens with\nwhatever they need? I’d like to…”\nBut Aesudan was already hurrying off toward another group in the\ngardens, one attended by several powerful highlord generals. Navani took a\ndeep breath and shoved down another stab of frustration. Aesudan claimed\nto care about propriety and manners, but she’d insert herself into a\nconversation between men without bringing her husband along as an\nexcuse.\n“Brightness!” the cook called again, waving to her.\nNavani took one last look at the ardent, then set her jaw and hurried to\nthe kitchens, careful not to catch her skirt on the ornamental shalebark.\n“What now?”\n“Wine,” the cook said. “We’re out of both the Clavendah and the Ruby\nBench.”\n“How?” she said. “We have reserves.…” She shared a glance with the\ncook, and the answer was evident. Dalinar had found their wine store again.\nHe’d grown quite ingenious at secretly draining the barrels for himself and\nhis friends. She wished he’d dedicate half as much attention to the\nkingdom’s needs.\n“I have a private store,” Navani said, pulling her notebook from her\npocket. She gripped it in her safehand through her sleeve as she scribbled a\nnote. “I keep it in the monastery with Sister Talanah. Show her this and\nshe’ll give you access.”\n“Thank you, Brightness,” the cook said, taking the note. Before the man\nwas out the door, Navani spotted the house steward—a white-bearded man\nwith too many rings on his fingers—hovering in the stairwell to the palace\nproper. He was fidgeting with the rings on his left hand. Bother.\n“What is it?” she asked, striding over.\n“Highlord Rine Hatham has arrived, and is asking about his audience\nwith the king. You remember, His Majesty promised to talk with Rine\ntonight about—”\n“About the border dispute and the misdrawn maps, yes,” Navani said,\nsighing. “And where is my husband?”\n“Unclear, Brightness,” the steward said. “He was last seen with\nBrightlord Amaram and some of those … uncommon figures.”\nThat was the term the palace staff used for Gavilar’s new friends, the\nones who seemed to arrive without warning or announcement, and who\nrarely gave their names.\nNavani ground her teeth, thinking through the places Gavilar might have\ngone. He would be angry if she interrupted him. Well, good. He should be\nseeing to his guests, rather than assuming she’d handle everything and\neveryone."

He should be\nseeing to his guests, rather than assuming she’d handle everything and\neveryone.\nUnfortunately, at the moment she … well, she would have to handle\neverything and everyone.\nShe let the anxious steward lead her up to the grand entryway, where\nguests were being entertained with music, drink, and poetry while the feast\nwas prepared. Others were escorted by master-servants to view the\nParshendi, the night’s true novelty. It wasn’t every day the king of Alethkar\nsigned a treaty with a group of mysterious parshmen who could talk.\nShe extended her apologies to Highlord Rine for Gavilar’s absence,\noffering to review the maps herself. After that, she was stopped by a line of\nimpatient men and women brought to the palace by the promise of an\naudience with the king.\nNavani assured the lighteyes their concerns were being heard. She\npromised to look into injustices. She soothed the crumpled feelings of those\nwho thought a personal invitation from the king meant they’d actually get\nto see him—a rare privilege these days, unless you were one of the\n“uncommon figures.”\nGuests were still showing up, of course. Ones who weren’t on the\nupdated list an annoyed Gavilar had provided for her earlier that day.\nVev’s golden keys! Navani forcibly painted on an amicable face for the\nguests. She smiled, she laughed, she waved. Using the reminders and lists\nshe kept in her notebook, she asked after families, new births, and favorite\naxehounds. She inquired about trade situations, took notes on which\nlighteyes seemed to be avoiding others. In short, she acted like a queen.\nIt was emotionally taxing work, but it was her duty. Perhaps someday\nshe’d be able to spend her days tinkering with fabrials and pretending she\nwas a scholar. Today, she’d do her job—though a part of her felt like an\nimpostor. However prestigious her ancient lineage might be, her anxiety\nwhispered that she was really just a backwater country girl wearing\nsomeone else’s clothing.\nThose insecurities had grown stronger lately. Calm. Calm. There was no\nroom for that sort of thinking. She rounded the room, pleased to note that\nAesudan had found Elhokar and was chatting with him for once—rather\nthan other men. Elhokar did look happy presiding over the pre-feast in his\nfather’s absence. Adolin and Renarin were there in stiff uniforms—the\nformer delighting a small group of young women, the latter appearing\ngangly and awkward as he stood by his brother.\nAnd … there was Dalinar. Standing tall. Somehow taller than any man in\nthe room. He wasn’t drunk yet, and people orbited him like they might a fire\non a cold night—needing to be close, but fearing the true heat of his\npresence. Those haunted eyes of his, simmering with passion.\nStorms alight. She excused herself and made a brief exit up the steps to\nwhere she wouldn’t feel so warm. It was a bad idea to leave; they were\nlacking a king, and questions were bound to arise if the queen vanished too.\nYet surely everyone could get on without her for a short time. Besides, up"

Besides, up\nhere she could check one of Gavilar’s hiding places.\nShe wound her way through the dungeonlike hallways, passing\nParshendi carrying drums nearby, speaking a language she did not\nunderstand. Why couldn’t this place have a little more natural light up here,\na few more windows? She’d brought the matter up with Gavilar, but he\nliked it this way. It gave him more places to hide.\nThere, she thought, stopping at an intersection. Voices.\n“… Being able to bring them back and forth from Braize doesn’t mean\nanything,” one said. “It’s too close to be a relevant distance.”\n“It was impossible only a few short years ago,” said a deep, powerful\nvoice. Gavilar. “This is proof. The Connection is not severed, and the box\nallows for travel. Not yet as far as you’d like, but we must start the journey\nsomewhere.”\nNavani peered around the corner. She could see a door at the end of the\nshort hallway ahead, cracked open, letting the voices leak out. Yes, Gavilar\nwas having a meeting right where she’d expected: in her study. It was a\ncozy little room with a nice window, tucked away in the corner of the\nsecond floor. A place she rarely had time to visit, but where people were\nunlikely to search for Gavilar.\nShe inched up to peek in through the cracked door. Gavilar Kholin had a\npresence big enough to fill a room all by himself. He wore a beard, but\ninstead of being unfashionable on him, it was … classic. Like a painting\ncome to life, a representation of old Alethkar. Some had thought he might\nstart a trend, but few were able to pull off the look.\nBeyond that, there was an air of … distortion around Gavilar. Nothing\nsupernatural or nonsensical. It was just that … well, you accepted that\nGavilar could do whatever he wanted, in defiance of any tradition or logic.\nFor him, it would work out. It always did.\nThe king was speaking with two men that Navani vaguely recognized. A\ntall Makabaki man with a birthmark on his cheek and a shorter Vorin man\nwith a round face and a small nose. They’d been called ambassadors from\nthe West, but no kingdom had been given for their home.\nThe Makabaki one leaned against the bookcase, his arms folded, his face\ncompletely expressionless. The Vorin man wrung his hands, reminding\nNavani of the palace steward, though this man seemed much younger.\nSomewhere … in his twenties? Maybe his thirties? No, he could be older.\nOn the table between Gavilar and the men lay a group of spheres and\ngemstones. Navani’s breath caught as she saw them. They were arrayed in a\nvariety of colors and brightness, but several seemed strangely off. They\nglowed with an inverse of light, as if they were little pits of violet darkness,\nsucking in the color around them.\nShe’d never seen anything like them before, but gemstones with spren\ntrapped inside could have all kinds of odd appearances and effects."

What was Gavilar doing with\nspheres, strange light, and distinguished artifabrians? And why wouldn’t he\ntalk to her about—\nGavilar suddenly stood up straight and glanced toward the doorway,\nthough Navani hadn’t made any sound. Their eyes met. So she pushed open\nthe door as if she had been on her way in. She wasn’t spying; she was queen\nof this palace. She could go where she wished, particularly her own study.\n“Husband,” she said. “There are guests missing you at the gathering. You\nseem to have lost track of time.”\n“Gentlemen,” Gavilar said to the two ambassadors, “I will need to\nexcuse myself.”\nThe nervous Vorin man ran his hand through his wispy hair. “I want to\nknow more of the project, Gavilar. Plus, you need to know that another of\nus is here tonight. I spotted her handiwork earlier.”\n“I have a meeting shortly with Meridas and the others,” Gavilar said.\n“They should have more information for me. We can speak again after\nthat.”\n“No,” the Makabaki man said, his voice sharp. “I doubt we shall.”\n“There’s more here, Nale!” the Vorin man said, though he followed as\nhis friend left. “This is important! I want out. This is the only way.…”\n“What was that about?” Navani asked as Gavilar closed the door. “Those\nare no ambassadors. Who are they really?”\nGavilar did not answer. With deliberate motions, he began plucking the\nspheres off the table and placing them into a pouch.\nNavani darted forward and snatched one. “What are these? How did you\nget spheres that glow like this? Does this have to do with the artifabrians\nyou’ve invited here?” She looked to him, waiting for some kind of answer,\nsome explanation.\nInstead, he held out his hand for her sphere. “This does not concern you,\nNavani. Return to the feast.”\nShe closed her hand around the sphere. “So I can continue to cover for\nyou? Did you promise Highlord Rine you’d mediate his dispute tonight of\nall times? Do you know how many people are expecting you? And did you\nsay you have another meeting to go to now, before the feast begins? Are\nyou simply going to ignore our guests?”\n“Do you know,” he said softly, “how tired I grow of your constant\nquestions, woman?”\n“Perhaps try answering one or two, then. It’d be a novel experience,\ntreating your wife like a human being—rather than like a machine built to\ncount the days of the week for you.”\nHe wagged his hand, demanding the sphere.\nInstinctively she gripped it tighter. “Why? Why do you continue to shut\nme out? Please, just tell me.”\n“I deal in secrets you could not handle, Navani. If you knew the scope of\nwhat I’ve begun…”\nShe frowned. The scope of what? He’d already conquered Alethkar.\nHe’d united the highprinces. Was this about how he had turned his eyes"

        "text": "what I’ve begun…”\nShe frowned. The scope of what? He’d already conquered Alethkar.\nHe’d united the highprinces. Was this about how he had turned his eyes\ntoward the Unclaimed Hills? Surely settling a patch of wildlands—\npopulated by nothing more than the odd tribe of parshmen—was nothing\ncompared to what he’d already accomplished.\nHe took her hand, forced apart her fingers, and removed the sphere. She\ndidn’t fight him; he would not react well. He had never used his strength\nagainst her, not in that way, but there had been words. Comments. Threats.\nHe took the strange transfixing sphere and stashed it in the pouch with\nthe others. He pulled the pouch tight with a taut snap of finality, then tucked\nit into his pocket.\n“You’re punishing me, aren’t you?” Navani demanded. “You know my\nlove of fabrials. You taunt me specifically because you know it will hurt.”\n“Perhaps,” Gavilar said, “you will learn to consider before you speak,\nNavani. Perhaps you will learn the dangerous price of rumors.”\nThis again? she thought. “Nothing happened, Gavilar.”\n“Do you think I care?” Gavilar said. “Do you think the court cares? To\nthem, lies are as good as facts.”\nThat was true, she realized. Gavilar didn’t care if she’d been unfaithful to\nhim—and she hadn’t. But the things she’d said had started rumors, difficult\nto smother.\nAll Gavilar cared about was his legacy. He wanted to be known as a\ngreat king, a great leader. That drive had always pushed him, but it was\ngrowing into something else lately. He kept asking: Would he be\nremembered as Alethkar’s greatest king? Could he compete with his\nancestors, men such as the Sunmaker?\nIf a king’s court thought he couldn’t control his own wife, wouldn’t that\nstain his legacy? What good was a kingdom if Gavilar knew that his wife\nsecretly loved his brother? In this, Navani represented a chip in the marble\nof his all-important legacy.\n“Speak to your daughter,” Gavilar said, turning toward the door. “I\nbelieve I have managed to soothe Amaram’s pride. He might take her back,\nand her time is running out. Few other suitors will consider her; I’ll likely\nneed to pay half the kingdom to get rid of the girl if she denies Meridas\nagain.”\nNavani sniffed. “You speak to her. If what you want is so important,\nmaybe you could do it yourself for once. Besides, I don’t care for Amaram.\nJasnah can do better.”\nHe froze, then looked back and spoke in a low, quiet voice. “Jasnah will\nmarry Amaram, as I have instructed her. She will put aside this fancy of\nbecoming famous by denying the church. Her arrogance stains the\nreputation of the entire family.”\nNavani stepped forward and let her voice grow as cold as his. “You\nrealize that girl still loves you, Gavilar. They all do. Elhokar, Dalinar, the\nboys … they worship you. Are you sure you want to reveal to them what"

They are your legacy. Treat them with care. They will define\nhow you are remembered.”\n“Greatness will define me, Navani. No mediocre effort by someone like\nDalinar or my son could undermine that—and I personally doubt Elhokar\ncould rise to even mediocre.”\n“And what about me?” she said. “I could write your history. Your life.\nWhatever you think you’ve done, whatever you think you’ve\naccomplished … that’s ephemeral, Gavilar. Words on the page define men\nto future generations. You spurn me, but I have a grip on what you cherish\nmost. Push me too far, and I will start squeezing.”\nHe didn’t respond with shouts or rage, but the cold void in his eyes could\nhave consumed kingdoms and left only blackness. He raised his hand to her\nchin and gently cupped it, a mockery of a once-passionate gesture.\nIt was more painful than a slap.\n“You know why I don’t involve you, Navani?” he said softly. “Do you\nthink you can take the truth?”\n“Try for once. It would be refreshing.”\n“You aren’t worthy, Navani. You claim to be a scholar, but where are\nyour discoveries? You study light, but you are its opposite. A thing that\ndestroys light. You spend your time wallowing in the muck of the kitchens\nand obsessing about whether or not some insignificant lighteyes recognizes\nthe right lines on a map.\n“These are not the actions of greatness. You are no scholar. You merely\nlike being near them. You are no artifabrian. You are merely a woman who\nlikes trinkets. You have no fame, accomplishment, or capacity of your own.\nEverything distinctive about you came from someone else. You have no\npower—you merely like to marry men who have it.”\n“How dare you—”\n“Deny it, Navani,” he snapped. “Deny that you loved one brother, but\nmarried the other. You pretended to adore a man you detested—all because\nyou knew he would be king.”\nShe recoiled from him, pulling out of his grip and turning her head to the\nside. She closed her eyes and felt tears on her cheeks. It was more\ncomplicated than he implied, as she had loved both of them—and Dalinar’s\nintensity had frightened her, so Gavilar had seemed the safer choice.\nBut there was a truth to Gavilar’s accusation. She could lie to herself and\nsay she’d seriously considered Dalinar, but they’d all known she’d\neventually choose Gavilar. And she had. He was the more influential of the\ntwo.\n“You went where the money and power would be greatest,” Gavilar said.\n“Like any common whore. Write whatever you want about me. Say it, shout\nit, proclaim it. I will outlive your accusations, and my legacy will persist. I\nhave discovered the entrance to the realm of gods and legends, and once I\njoin them, my kingdom will never end. I will never end.”\nHe left then, closing the door behind him with a quiet click. Even in an\nargument he controlled the situation."

Even in an\nargument he controlled the situation.\nTrembling, Navani fumbled her way to a seat by the desk, which boiled\nover with angerspren. And shamespren, which fluttered around her like\nwhite and red petals.\nFury made her shake. Fury at him. At herself for not fighting back. At the\nworld, because she knew what he said was at least partially true.\nNo. Don’t let his lies become your truth. Fight it. Teeth gritted, she\nopened her eyes and began rummaging in her desk for some oil paint and\npaper.\nShe began painting, taking care with each calligraphic line. Pride—as if\nproof to him—compelled her to be meticulous and perfect. The act usually\nsoothed her. The way that neat, orderly lines became words, the way that\npaint and paper transformed into meaning.\nIn the end, she had one of the finest glyphwards she’d ever created. It\nread, simply, Death. Gift. Death. She’d drawn each glyph in the shapes of\nGavilar’s tower or sword heraldry.\nThe prayer burned eagerly in the lamp flame, flaring bright—and as it\ndid, her catharsis turned to shame. What was she doing? Praying for her\nhusband’s death? The shamespren returned in a burst.\nHow had it come to this? Their arguments grew worse and worse. She\nknew he was not this man, the one he showed her lately. He wasn’t like this\nwhen he spoke to Dalinar, or to Sadeas, or even—usually—to Jasnah.\nGavilar was better than this. She suspected he knew it too. Tomorrow\nshe would receive flowers. No apology to accompany them, but a gift,\nusually a bracelet.\nYes, he knew he should be something more. But … somehow she\nbrought out the monster in him. And he somehow brought out the weakness\nin her. She slammed her safehand palm against the table, rubbing her\nforehead with her other hand.\nStorms. It seemed not so long ago that they’d sat conspiring together\nabout the kingdom they would forge. Now they barely spoke without\nreaching for their sharpest knives—stabbing them right into the most\npainful spots with an accuracy gained only through longtime familiarity.\nShe composed herself with effort, redoing her makeup, touching up her\nhair. She might be the things he said, but he was no more than a backwater\nthug with too much luck and a knack for fooling good men into following\nhim.\nIf a man like that could pretend to be a king, she could pretend to be a\nqueen. At any rate, they had a kingdom.\nAt least one of them should try to run it.\n* * *\nNavani didn’t hear of the assassination until it had been accomplished.\nAt the feast, they’d been the model of perfect royalty, cordial to one\nanother, leading their respective meals.

Yes, she was certain he’d be holding audience\nsoon. They’d love to visit once the next storm passed.…\nOn and on she went, until each smile made her face feel as if it would\ncrack. She was relieved when a messenger girl came running for her. She\nstepped away from the departing guests, expecting to hear that an expensive\nvase had shattered, or that Dalinar was snoring at his table.\nInstead, the messenger girl brought Navani over to the palace steward,\nhis face a mask of grief. Eyes reddened, hands shaking, the aged man\nreached out for her and took her arm—as if for stability. Tears ran down his\nface, getting caught in his wispy beard.\nSeeing his emotion, she realized she rarely thought of the man by his\nname, rarely thought of him as a person. She’d often treated him like a\nfixture of the palace, much as one might the statues out front. Much as\nGavilar treated her.\n“Gereh,” she said, taking his hand, embarrassed. “What happened? Are\nyou well? Have we been working you too hard without—”\n“The king,” the elderly man choked out. “Oh, Brightness, they’ve taken\nour king! Those parshmen. Those barbarians. Those … those monsters.”\nHer immediate suspicion was that Gavilar had found some way to escape\nthe palace, and everyone thought he’d been kidnapped. That man … she\nthought, imagining him out in the city with his uncommon visitors,\ndiscussing secrets in a dark room.\nGereh held to her tighter. “Brightness, they’ve killed him. King Gavilar\nis dead.”\n“Impossible,” she said. “He’s the most powerful man in the land, perhaps\nthe world. Surrounded by Shardbearers. You are mistaken, Gereh. He’s…”\nHe’s as enduring as the storms. But of course that wasn’t true—it was\nmerely what he wished people to think. I will never end.… When he said\nthings like that, it was hard to disbelieve him.\nShe had to see the body before the truth started to seep in at last, chilling\nher like a winter rain. Gavilar, broken and bloody, lay on a table in the\nlarder—with guards forcibly turning aside the frightened house staff when\nthey asked for explanations.\nNavani stood over him. Even with the blood in his beard, the shattered\nShardplate, his lack of breath and the gaping wounds in his flesh … even\nthen she wondered if it was a trick. What lay before her was an\nimpossibility. Gavilar Kholin couldn’t simply die like other men.\nShe had them show her the fallen balcony, where Gavilar had been found\nlifeless after dropping from above. Jasnah had witnessed it, they said. The\nnormally unflappable girl sat in the corner, her fisted safehand to her mouth\nas she cried.\nOnly then did the shockspren begin to appear around Navani, like\ntriangles of breaking light.

She listened in a numb sense of disconnect. She had been so\nbusy, she hadn’t realized that most of the Parshendi had left the palace in\nsecret—fleeing into the darkness moments before their minion attacked.\nTheir leaders had stayed behind to cover up the withdrawal.\nIn a trance, Navani walked back to the larder and the cold husk of\nGavilar Kholin. His discarded shell. From the looks of the attending\nservants and surgeons, they anticipated grief from her. Wailing perhaps.\nCertainly there were painspren appearing in droves in the room, even a few\nrare anguishspren, like teeth growing from the walls.\nShe felt something akin to those emotions. Sorrow? No, not exactly.\nRegret. If he truly was dead, then … that was it. Their last real conversation\nhad been another argument. There was no going back. Always before, she’d\nbeen able to tell herself that they’d reconcile. That they’d hunt through the\nthorns and find a path to return to what they’d been. If not loving, then at\nleast aligned.\nNow that would never be. It was over. He was dead, she was a widow,\nand … storms, she’d prayed for this. That knowledge stabbed her straight\nthrough. She had to hope the Almighty hadn’t listened to her foolish pleas\nwritten in a moment of fury. Although a part of her had grown to hate\nGavilar, she didn’t truly want him dead. Did she?\nNo. No, this was not how it should have ended. And so she felt another\nemotion. Pity.\nLying there, blood pooling on the tabletop around him, Gavilar Kholin’s\ncorpse seemed the ultimate insult to his grand plans. He thought he was\neternal, did he? He thought to reach for some grand vision, too important to\nshare with her? Well, the Father of Storms and the Mother of the World\nignored the desires of men, no matter how grand.\nWhat she didn’t feel was grief. His death was meaningful, but it didn’t\nmean anything to her. Other than perhaps a way for her children to never\nhave to learn what he’d become.\nI will be the better person, Gavilar, she thought, closing his eyes. For\nwhat you once were, I’ll let the world pretend. I’ll give you your legacy.\nThen she paused. His Shardplate—well, the Plate he was wearing—had\nbroken near the waist. She reached her fingers into his pocket and brushed\nhogshide leather. She eased out the pouch of spheres he’d been showing off\nearlier, but found it empty.\nStorms. Where had he put them?\nSomeone in the room coughed, and she became suddenly cognizant of\nhow it looked for her to be rifling through his pockets. Navani took the\nspheres from her hair, put them into the pouch, then folded it into his hand\nbefore resting her forehead on his broken chest. That would appear as if she\nwere returning gifts to him, symbolizing her light becoming his as he died.\nThen, with his blood on her face, she stood up and made a show of"

Years of training as a surgeon served him well today. Breathing\nexercises—intended to keep his hands steady—worked as well during\nespionage as they did during surgery.\n“Here,” he said to the child’s mother, digging a small carved carapace\nchit from his pocket. “Show this to the woman at the dining pavilion. She’ll\nget some juice for your son. Make certain he drinks it all, each morning.”\n“Very thank you,” the woman said in a thick Herdazian accent. She\ngathered her son close, then looked to Lirin with haunted eyes. “If … if\nchild … found…”\n“I will make certain you’re notified if we hear of your other children,”\nLirin promised. “I’m sorry for your loss.”\nShe nodded, wiped her cheeks, and carried the child to the watchpost\noutside of town. Here, a group of armed parshmen lifted her hood and\ncompared her face to drawings sent by the Fused. Hesina, Lirin’s wife,\nstood nearby to read the descriptions as required.\nBehind them, the morning fog obscured Hearthstone. It seemed to be a\ngroup of dark, shadowy lumps. Like tumors. Lirin could barely make out\ntarps stretched between buildings, offering meager shelter for the many\nrefugees pouring out of Herdaz. Entire streets were closed off, and phantom\nsounds—plates clinking, people talking—rose through the fog.\nThose shanties would never last a storm, of course, but they could be\nquickly torn down and stowed.

        "text": "town hold? The villages closer to the border must be filled to capacity, if so\nmany were making their way this far inward.\nIt had been over a year since the coming of the Everstorm and the fall of\nAlethkar. A year during which the country of Herdaz—Alethkar’s smaller\nneighbor to the northwest—had somehow kept fighting. Two months ago,\nthe enemy had finally decided to crush the kingdom for good. Refugee\nnumbers had increased soon after. As usual, the soldiers fought while the\ncommon people—their fields trampled—starved and were forced out of\ntheir homes.\nHearthstone did what it could. Aric and the other men—once guards at\nRoshone’s manor, now forbidden weapons—organized the line and kept\nanyone from sneaking into town before Lirin saw them. He had persuaded\nBrightness Abiajan that it was essential he inspect each individual. She\nworried about plague; he just wanted to intercept those who might need\ntreatment.\nHer soldiers moved down the line, alert. Parshmen carrying swords.\nLearning to read, insisting they be called “singers.” A year after their\nawakening, Lirin still found the notions odd. But really, what was it to him?\nIn some ways, little had changed. The same old conflicts consumed the\nparshmen as easily as they had the Alethi brightlords. People who got a\ntaste of power wanted more, then sought it with the sword. Ordinary people\nbled, and Lirin was left to stitch them up.\nHe returned to his work. Lirin had at least a hundred more refugees to\nsee today. Hiding somewhere among them was a man who had authored\nmuch of this suffering. He was the reason Lirin was so nervous today. The\nnext person in line was not him, however, but was instead a ragged Alethi\nman who had lost an arm in battle. Lirin inspected the refugee’s wound, but\nit was a few months old at this point, and there was nothing Lirin could do\nabout the extensive scarring.\nLirin moved his finger back and forth before the man’s face, watching\nhis eyes track it. Shock, Lirin thought. “Have you suffered recent wounds\nyou’re not telling me about?”\n“No wounds,” the man whispered. “But brigands … they took my wife,\ngood surgeon. Took her … left me tied to a tree. Just walked off\nlaughing…”\nBother. Mental shock wasn’t something Lirin could cut out with a\nscalpel. “Once you enter the town,” he said, “look for tent fourteen. Tell the\nwomen there I sent you.”\nThe man nodded dully, his stare hollow. Had he registered the words?\nMemorizing the man’s features—greying hair with a cowlick in the back,\nthree large moles on the upper left cheek, and of course the missing arm—\nLirin made a note to check that tent for him tonight. Assistants there\nwatched refugees who might turn suicidal. It was, with so many to care for,\nthe best Lirin could manage.\n“On with you,” Lirin said, gently pushing the man toward the town.\n“Tent fourteen. Don’t forget. I’m sorry for your loss.”\nThe man walked off.\n“You say it so easily, surgeon,” a voice said from behind."

I’m sorry for your loss.”\nThe man walked off.\n“You say it so easily, surgeon,” a voice said from behind.\nLirin spun, then immediately bowed in respect. Abiajan, the new\ncitylady, was a parshwoman with stark white skin and fine red marbling on\nher cheeks.\n“Brightness,” Lirin said. “What was that?”\n“You told that man you were sorry for his loss,” Abiajan said. “You say\nit so readily to each of them—but you seem to have the compassion of a\nstone. Do you feel nothing for these people?”\n“I feel, Brightness,” Lirin said, “but I must be careful not to be\noverwhelmed by their pain. It’s one of the first rules of becoming a\nsurgeon.”\n“Curious.” The parshwoman raised her safehand, which was shrouded in\nthe sleeve of a havah. “Do you remember setting my arm when I was a\nchild?”\n“I do.” Abiajan had returned—with a new name and a new commission\nfrom the Fused—after fleeing with the others following the Everstorm. She\nhad brought many parshmen with her, all from this region, but of those\nfrom Hearthstone only Abiajan had returned. She remained closed-lipped\nabout what she had experienced in the intervening months.\n“Such a curious memory,” she said. “That life feels like a dream now. I\nremember pain. Confusion. A stern figure bringing me more pain—though I\nnow recognize you were seeking to heal me. So much trouble to go through\nfor a slave child.”\n“I have never cared who I heal, Brightness. Slave or king.”\n“I’m sure the fact that Wistiow had paid good money for me had nothing\nto do with it.” She narrowed her eyes at Lirin, and when she next spoke\nthere was a cadence to her words, as if she were speaking the words to a\nsong. “Did you feel for me, the poor confused slave child whose mind had\nbeen stolen from her? Did you weep for us, surgeon, and the life we led?”\n“A surgeon must not weep,” Lirin said softly. “A surgeon cannot afford\nto weep.”\n“Like a stone,” she said again, then shook her head. “Have you seen any\nplaguespren on these refugees? If those spren get into the city, it could kill\neveryone.”\n“Disease isn’t caused by spren,” Lirin said. “It is spread by contaminated\nwater, improper sanitation, or sometimes by the breath of those who bear\nit.”\n“Superstition,” she said.\n“The wisdom of the Heralds,” Lirin replied. “We should be careful.”\nFragments of old manuscripts—translations of translations of translations—\nmentioned quick-spreading diseases that had killed tens of thousands. Such\nthings hadn’t been recorded in any modern texts he’d been read, but he had\nheard rumors of something strange to the west—a new plague, they were\ncalling it. Details were sparse.\nAbiajan moved on without further comment. Her attendants—a group of\nelevated parshmen and parshwomen—joined her.

The Fused\nhad explained that singers in the past eschewed bright colors, preferring to\nhighlight their skin patterns instead.\nLirin sensed a search for identity in the way Abiajan and the other\nparshmen acted. Their accents, their dress, their mannerisms—they were all\ndistinctly Alethi. But they grew transfixed whenever the Fused spoke of\ntheir ancestors, and they sought ways to emulate those long-dead parshmen.\nLirin turned to the next group of refugees—a complete family for once.\nThough he should have been happy, he couldn’t help wondering how\ndifficult it was going to be to feed five children and parents who were all\nflagging from poor nutrition.\nAs he sent them on, a familiar figure moved along the line toward him,\nshooing away hungerspren. Laral wore a simple servant’s dress now, with a\ngloved hand instead of a sleeve, and she carried a water bucket to the\nwaiting refugees. Laral didn’t walk like a servant though. There was a\ncertain … determination about the young woman that no forced\nsubservience could smother. The end of the world seemed roughly as\nbothersome to her as a poor harvest once had.\nShe paused by Lirin and offered him a drink—taken from her waterskin\nand poured into a fresh cup as he insisted, rather than ladled straight from\nthe bucket.\n“He’s three down,” Laral whispered as Lirin sipped.\nLirin grunted.\n“Shorter than I expected him to be,” Laral noted. “He’s supposed to be a\ngreat general, leader of the Herdazian resistance. He looks more like a\ntraveling merchant.”\n“Genius comes in all shapes, Laral,” Lirin said, waving for her to refill\nhis cup to give an excuse for them to keep talking.\n“Still…” she said, then fell silent as Durnash passed by, a tall parshman\nwith marbled black and red skin, a sword on his back. Once he was well on\nhis way, she continued softly, “I’m honestly surprised at you, Lirin. Not\nonce have you suggested we turn in this hidden general.”\n“He’d be executed,” Lirin said.\n“You think of him as a criminal though, don’t you?”\n“He bears a terrible responsibility; he perpetuated a war against an\noverwhelming enemy force. He threw away the lives of his men in a\nhopeless battle.”\n“Some would call that heroism.”\n“Heroism is a myth you tell idealistic young people—specifically when\nyou want them to go bleed for you. It got one of my sons killed and another\ntaken from me. You can keep your heroism and return to me the lives of\nthose wasted on foolish conflicts.”\nAt least it seemed to almost be over. Now that the resistance in Herdaz\nhad finally collapsed, hopefully the refugee flood would slow.\nLaral watched him with pale green eyes. She was a keen one.

Lirin might call this woman daughter, and might have both\nTien and Kaladin beside him now, working as surgeons.\n“I won’t turn in the Herdazian general,” Lirin said. “Stop looking at me\nlike that. I hate war, but I won’t condemn your hero.”\n“And your son will come fetch him soon?”\n“We’ve sent Kal word. That should be enough. Make sure your husband\nis ready with his distraction.”\nShe nodded and moved on to offer water to the parshman guards at the\ntown entrance. Lirin got through the next few refugees quickly, then\nreached a group of cloaked figures. He calmed himself with the quick\nbreathing exercise his master had taught him in the surgery room all those\nyears ago. Although his insides were a storm, Lirin’s hands didn’t shake as\nhe waved forward the cloaked figures.\n“I will need to do an examination,” Lirin said softly, “so it doesn’t seem\nunusual when I pull you out of the line.”\n“Begin with me,” said the shortest of the men. The other four shifted\ntheir positions, placing themselves carefully around him.\n“Don’t look so much like you’re guarding him, you sodden fools,” Lirin\nhissed. “Here, sit down on the ground. Maybe you’ll seem less like a gang\nof thugs that way.”\nThey did as requested, and Lirin pulled over his stool beside the apparent\nleader. He bore a thin, silvered mustache on his upper lip, and was perhaps\nin his fifties. His sun-leathered skin was darker than most Herdazians’; he\ncould almost have passed for Azish. His eyes were a deep dark brown.\n“You’re him?” Lirin whispered as he put his ear to the man’s chest to\ncheck his heartbeat.\n“I am,” the man said.\nDieno enne Calah. Dieno “the Mink” in Old Herdazian. Hesina had\nexplained that enne was an honorific that implied greatness.\nOne might have expected the Mink—as Laral apparently had—to be a\nbrutal warrior forged on the same anvil as men like Dalinar Kholin or\nMeridas Amaram. Lirin, however, knew that killers came in all kinds of\npackages. The Mink might be short and missing a tooth, but there was a\npower to his lean build, and Lirin spotted not a few scars in his\nexamination. Those around the wrists, in fact … those were the scars\nmanacles made on the skin of slaves.\n“Thank you,” Dieno whispered, “for offering us refuge.”\n“It wasn’t my choice,” Lirin said.\n“Still, you ensure that the resistance will escape to live on. Heralds bless\nyou, surgeon.”\nLirin dug out a bandage, then began wrapping a wound on the man’s arm\nthat hadn’t been seen to properly. “The Heralds bless us with a quick end to\nthis conflict.”\n“Yes, with the invaders sent running all the way back to Damnation from\nwhich they were spawned.”\nLirin continued his work.\n“You … disagree, surgeon?”\n“Your resistance has failed, General,” Lirin said, pulling the bandage"

        "text": "which they were spawned.”\nLirin continued his work.\n“You … disagree, surgeon?”\n“Your resistance has failed, General,” Lirin said, pulling the bandage\ntight. “Your kingdom has fallen like my own. Further conflict will only\nleave more men dead.”\n“Surely you don’t intend to obey these monsters.”\n“I obey the person who holds the sword to my neck, General,” Lirin said.\n“Same as I always have.”\nHe finished his work, then gave the general’s four companions cursory\nexaminations. No women. How would the general read messages sent to\nhim?\nLirin made a show of discovering a wound on one man’s leg, and—with\na little coaching—the man limped on it properly, then let out a painful howl.\nA poke of a needle made painspren claw up from the ground, shaped like\nlittle orange hands.\n“That will need surgery,” Lirin said loudly. “Or you might lose the leg.\nNo, no complaints. We’re going to see to that right away.”\nHe had Aric fetch a litter. Positioning the other four soldiers—the\ngeneral included—as bearers for that litter gave Lirin an excuse to pull\nthem all out of line.\nNow they just needed the distraction. It came in the form of Toralin\nRoshone: Laral’s husband, former citylord. He stumbled out of the fog-\nshrouded town, wobbling and walking unsteadily.\nLirin waved to the Mink and his soldiers, slowly leading them toward\nthe inspection post. “You aren’t armed, are you?” he hissed under his\nbreath.\n“We left obvious weapons behind,” the Mink replied, “but it will be my\nface—and not our arms—that betrays us.”\n“We’ve prepared for that.” Pray to the Almighty it works.\nAs Lirin drew near, he could better make out Roshone. The former\ncitylord’s cheeks hung in deflated jowls, still reflecting the weight he’d lost\nfollowing his son’s death seven years ago. Roshone had been ordered to\nshave his beard, perhaps because he’d been fond of it, and he no longer\nwore his proud warrior’s takama. That had been replaced by the kneepads\nand short trousers of a crem scraper.\nHe carried a stool under one arm and muttered in a slurred voice, his\nwooden peg of a foot scraping stone as he walked. Lirin honestly couldn’t\ntell if Roshone had gotten drunk for the display, or if he was faking. The\nman drew attention either way. The parshmen manning the inspection post\nnudged one another, and one hummed to an upbeat rhythm—something\nthey often did when amused.\nRoshone picked a building nearby and set down his stool, then—to the\ndelight of the watching parshmen—tried stepping up on it, but missed and\nstumbled, teetering on his peg, nearly falling.\nThey loved watching him. Every one of these newly born singers had\nbeen owned by one wealthy lighteyes or another. Watching a former\ncitylord reduced to a stumbling drunk who spent his days doing the most\nmenial of jobs? To them it was more captivating than any storyteller’s\nperformance.\nLirin stepped up to the guard post. “This one needs immediate surgery,”"

To them it was more captivating than any storyteller’s\nperformance.\nLirin stepped up to the guard post. “This one needs immediate surgery,”\nhe said, gesturing to the man in the litter. “If I don’t get to him now, he\nmight lose a limb. My wife will have the rest of the refugees sit and wait for\nmy return.”\nOf the three parshmen assigned as inspectors, only Dor bothered to\ncheck the “wounded” man’s face against the drawings. The Mink was top of\nthe list of dangerous refugees, but Dor didn’t spare a glance for the litter\nbearers. Lirin had noticed the oddity a few days earlier: when he used\nrefugees from the line as labor, the inspectors often fixated solely on the\nperson in the litter.\nHe’d hoped that with Roshone to provide entertainment, the parshmen\nwould be even more lax. Still, Lirin felt himself sweating as Dor hesitated\non one of the pictures. Lirin’s letter—returned with the scout who had\narrived begging for asylum—had warned the Mink to bring only low-level\nguards who wouldn’t be on the lists. Could it—\nThe other two parshmen laughed at Roshone, who was trying—despite\nhis drunkenness—to reach the roof of the building and scrape away the\ncrem buildup there. Dor turned and joined them, absently waving Lirin\nforward.\nLirin shared a brief glance with his wife, who waited nearby. It was a\ngood thing none of the parshmen were facing her, because she was pale as a\nShin woman. Lirin probably didn’t look much better, but he held in his sigh\nof relief as he led the Mink and his soldiers forward. He could sequester\nthem in the surgery room, away from the public eye until—\n“Everyone stop what you’re doing!” a female voice shouted from\nbehind. “Prepare to give deference!”\nLirin felt an immediate urge to bolt. He almost did, but the soldiers\nsimply kept walking at a regular pace. Yes. Pretend that you hadn’t heard.\n“You, surgeon!” the voice shouted at him. It was Abiajan. Reluctantly\nLirin halted, excuses running through his mind. Would she believe he\nhadn’t recognized the Mink? Lirin was already in rough winds with the\ncitylady after insisting on treating Jeber’s wounds after the fool had gotten\nhimself strung up and whipped.\nLirin turned around, trying hard to calm his nerves. Abiajan hurried up,\nand although singers didn’t blush, she was clearly flustered. When she\nspoke, her words had adopted a staccato cadence. “Attend me. We have a\nvisitor.”\nIt took Lirin a moment to process the words. She wasn’t demanding an\nexplanation. This was about … something else?\n“What’s wrong, Brightness?” he asked.\nNearby, the Mink and his soldiers stopped, but Lirin could see their arms\nshifting beneath their cloaks. They’d said they’d left behind “obvious”\nweapons. Almighty help him, if this turned bloody …\n“Nothing’s wrong,” Abiajan said, speaking quickly. “We’ve been\nblessed. Attend me.” She looked to Dor and the inspectors. “Pass the word."

Attend me.” She looked to Dor and the inspectors. “Pass the word.\nNobody is to enter or leave the town until I give word otherwise.”\n“Brightness,” Lirin said, gesturing toward the man in the litter. “This\nman’s wound may not appear dire, but I’m certain that if I don’t tend to it\nimmediately, he—”\n“It will wait.” She pointed to the Mink and his men. “You five, wait.\nEveryone just wait. All right. Wait and … and you, surgeon, come with\nme.”\nShe strode away, expecting Lirin to follow. He met the Mink’s eyes and\nnodded for him to wait, then hurried after the citylady. What could have put\nher so out of sorts? She’d been practicing a regal air, but had now\nabandoned it completely.\nLirin crossed the field outside of town, walking alongside the line of\nrefugees, and soon found his answer. A hulking figure easily seven feet tall\nemerged from the fog, accompanied by a small squad of parshmen with\nweapons. The dreadful creature had a beard and long hair the color of dried\nblood, and it seemed to meld with his simple wrap of clothing—as if he\nwore his hair itself for a covering. He had a pure black skin coloring, with\nlines of marbled red under his eyes.\nMost importantly, he had a jagged carapace unlike any Lirin had seen,\nwith a strange pair of carapace fins—or horns—rising above his ears.\nThe creature’s eyes glowed a soft red. One of the Fused. Here in\nHearthstone.\nIt had been months since Lirin had seen one—and that had been only in\npassing as a small group had stopped on the way to the battlefront in\nHerdaz. That group had soared through the air in breezy robes, bearing long\nspears. They had evoked an ethereal beauty, but the carapace on this\ncreature looked far more wicked—like something one might expect to have\ncome from Damnation.\nThe Fused spoke in a rhythmic language to a smaller figure at his side, a\nwarform parshwoman. Singer, Lirin told himself. Not parshwoman. Use the\nright term even in your head, so you don’t slip when speaking.\nThe warform stepped forward to translate for the Fused. From what Lirin\nhad heard, even those Fused who spoke Alethi often used interpreters, as if\nspeaking human tongues were beneath them.\n“You,” the interpreter said to Lirin, “are the surgeon? You’ve been\ninspecting the people today?”\n“Yes,” Lirin said.\nThe Fused replied, and again the interpreter translated. “We are\nsearching for a spy. He might be hidden among these refugees.”\nLirin felt his mouth go dry. The thing standing above him was a\nnightmare that should have remained a legend, a demon whispered of\naround the midnight fire. When Lirin tried to speak, the words wouldn’t\ncome out, and he had to cough to clear his throat.\nAt a barked order from the Fused, the soldiers with him spread out to the\nwaiting line.

The refugees backed away, and several tried to run, but the\nparshmen—though small beside the Fused—were warforms, with powerful\nstrength and terrible speed. They caught runners while others began\nsearching through the line, throwing back hoods and inspecting faces.\nDon’t look behind you at the Mink, Lirin. Don’t seem nervous.\n“We…” Lirin said. “We inspect each person, comparing them to the\ndrawings given us. I promise you. We’ve been watchful! No need to\nterrorize these poor refugees.”\nThe interpreter didn’t translate Lirin’s words for the Fused, but the\ncreature spoke immediately in its own language.\n“The one we seek is not on those lists,” the interpreter said. “He is a\nyoung man, a spy of the most dangerous kind. He would be fit and strong\ncompared to these refugees, though he might have feigned weakness.”\n“That … that could describe any number of people,” Lirin said. Could he\nbe in luck? Could this be a coincidence? It might not be about the Mink at\nall. Lirin felt a moment of hope, like sunlight peeking through stormclouds.\n“You would remember this man,” the interpreter continued. “Tall for a\nhuman, with wavy black hair worn to the shoulders. Clean shaven, he has a\nslave’s brand on his forehead. Including the glyph shash.”\nSlave’s brand.\nShash. Dangerous.\nOh no …\nNearby, one of the Fused’s soldiers threw back the hood of another\ncloaked refugee—revealing a face that should have been intimately familiar\nto Lirin. Yet the harsh man Kaladin had become looked like a crude\ndrawing of the sensitive youth Lirin remembered.\nKaladin immediately burst alight with power. Death had come to visit\nHearthstone today, despite Lirin’s every effort.\nNext, let the spren inspect your trap. The gemstone must not be fully\ninfused, but also cannot be fully dun. Experiments have concluded that\nseventy percent of maximum Stormlight capacity works best.\nIf you have done your work correctly, the spren will become\nfascinated by its soon-to-be prison. It will dance around the stone,\npeek at it, float around it.\n—Lecture on fabrial mechanics presented by Navani Kholin to\nthe coalition of monarchs, Urithiru, Jesevan, 1175\n“I told you we’d been spotted,” Syl said as Kaladin flared with Stormlight.\nKaladin grunted in reply. Syl formed into a majestic silvery spear as he\nswept his hand outward—the weapon’s appearance forcing back the singers\nwho had been searching for him. Kaladin pointedly avoided looking at his\nfather, to not betray their relationship. Besides, he knew what he would see.\nDisappointment.\nSo, nothing new.\nRefugees scrambled away in a panic, but the Fused no longer cared\nabout them. The hulking figure turned toward Kaladin, arms folded, and\nsmiled.\nI told you, Syl said in Kaladin’s mind. I’m going to keep reminding you\nuntil you acknowledge how intelligent I am."

        "text": "smiled.\nI told you, Syl said in Kaladin’s mind. I’m going to keep reminding you\nuntil you acknowledge how intelligent I am.\n“This is a new variety,” Kaladin said, keeping his spear leveled at the\nFused. “You ever seen one of these before?”\nNo. Seems uglier than most though.\nOver the last year, new varieties of Fused had been appearing on the\nbattlefields in a trickle. Kaladin was most familiar with the ones who could\nfly like Windrunners. Those were called the shanay-im, they’d learned; it\nroughly meant “Those Ones of the Heavens.”\nOther Fused could not fly; as with the Radiants, each type had their own\nset of powers. Jasnah posited there would be ten varieties, though Dalinar—\noffering no explanation of why he knew this—said there would be only\nnine.\nThis variety marked the seventh Kaladin had fought. And, winds willing,\nthe seventh he would kill. Kaladin raised his spear to challenge the Fused to\nsingle combat, an action that always worked with the Heavenly Ones. This\nFused, however, waved for his companions to strike at Kaladin from all\nsides.\nKaladin responded by Lashing himself upward. As he darted into the\nsky, Syl automatically lengthened her shape into a long lance ideal for\nstriking at ground objects from the air. Stormlight churned inside Kaladin,\ndaring him to move, to act, to fight. But he needed to be careful. There were\ncivilians in the area, including several very dear to him.\n“Let’s see if we can draw them away,” Kaladin said. He Lashed himself\ndownward at an angle so he swooped backward toward the ground.\nUnfortunately, the fog kept Kaladin from going too far or too high, lest he\nlose sight of his enemies.\nBe careful, Syl said. We don’t know what kinds of powers this new Fused\nmight—\nThe fog-shrouded figure in the near distance collapsed suddenly, and\nsomething shot out of the body—a small line of red-violet light like a spren.\nThat line of light darted to Kaladin in the blink of an eye, then it expanded\nto re-form the shape of the Fused with a sound like stretching leather mixed\nwith grinding stone.\nThe Fused appeared in the air right in front of Kaladin. Before Kaladin\ncould react, the Fused had grabbed him by the throat with one hand and by\nthe front of the uniform with another.\nSyl yelped, fuzzing to mist—her lance form was far too unwieldy for\nsuch a close-quarters fight. The weight of the enormous Fused, with his\nstony carapace and thick muscles, dragged Kaladin out of the air and\nslammed him against the ground, flat on his back.\nThe Fused’s constricting fingers cut off Kaladin’s airflow, but with\nStormlight raging inside him, Kaladin didn’t need to breathe. Still, he\ngrabbed the Fused’s hands to pry them free. Stormfather! The creature was\nstrong. Moving his fingers was like trying to bend steel. Shrugging off the\ninitial panic of being yanked out of the air, Kaladin gathered his wits and\nsummoned Syl as a dagger. He sliced the Fused’s right hand, then his left,"

He sliced the Fused’s right hand, then his left,\nleaving the fingers dead.\nThose would heal—the Fused, like Radiants, used Light to repair their\nwounds. But with the creature’s fingers dead, Kaladin kicked free with a\ngrunt. He Lashed himself upward again, soaring into the air. Before he\ncould catch his breath, however, a red-violet light streaked through the fog\nbelow, looping about itself and zipping up behind Kaladin.\nA viselike arm grabbed him in an arm triangle from behind. A second\nlater, a piercing pain stabbed Kaladin between the shoulders as the Fused\nknifed him in the neck.\nKaladin screamed and felt his limbs go numb as his spinal cord was\nsevered. His Stormlight rushed to heal the wound, but this Fused was\nplainly experienced at fighting Surgebinders, because he continued to\nplunge the knife into Kaladin’s neck time and time again, keeping him from\nrecovering.\n“Kaladin!” Syl said, flitting around him. “Kaladin! What should I do?”\nShe formed into a shield in his hand, but his limp fingers dropped her, and\nshe returned to her spren form.\nThe Fused’s moves were expert, precise as he hung on from behind—he\ndidn’t seem to be able to fly when in humanoid shape, only as a ribbon of\nlight. Kaladin felt hot breath on his cheek as the creature stabbed again and\nagain. The part of Kaladin trained by his father considered the wound\nanalytically. Severing of the spine. Repeated infliction of full paralysis. A\nclever way of dealing with an enemy who could heal. Kaladin’s Stormlight\nwould run out quickly at this rate.\nThe soldier in Kaladin worked more by instinct than deliberate thought,\nand noticed—despite spinning in the air, grappled by a terrible enemy—that\nhe regained a single moment of mobility before each new stab. So as the\ntingling feeling rushed through his body, Kaladin bent forward, then\nslammed his head back into that of the Fused.\nA flash of pain and white light disrupted Kaladin’s sight. He twisted as\nhe felt the Fused’s grip slacken, then drop. The creature seized Kaladin by\nhis coat, hanging on—a mere shadow to Kaladin’s swimming vision. That\nwas enough. Kaladin swept his hand at the thing’s neck, Syl forming as a\nside sword. Cut through the gemheart, the head, or the neck with a Blade,\nand—great powers notwithstanding—the Fused would die.\nKaladin’s vision recovered enough to let him see a violet-red light burst\nfrom the chest of the Fused. He left a body behind each time his soul—or\nwhatever—became a ribbon of red light. Kaladin’s Blade sliced the body’s\nhead clean off, but the light had already escaped.\nStormwinds. This thing seemed more spren than singer. The discarded\nbody tumbled through the fog, and Kaladin followed it down, his wounds\nfully healing. He breathed in a second pouch of spheres as he landed beside\nthe fallen corpse. Could he even kill this being? A Shardblade could cut\nspren, but that didn’t kill them. They re-formed eventually."

A Shardblade could cut\nspren, but that didn’t kill them. They re-formed eventually.\nSweat poured down Kaladin’s face, his heart thundering inside him.\nThough Stormlight urged him to move, he stilled himself and watched the\nfog, searching for signs of the Fused. They’d gotten far enough from the\ncity that he couldn’t see anyone else. Just shadowed hills. Empty.\nStorms. That was close. As close to death as he’d come in a long, long\nwhile. Made all the more alarming by how quickly and unexpectedly the\nFused had taken him. There was a danger to feeling like he owned the\nwinds and the sky, to knowing he could heal quickly.\nKaladin turned around slowly, feeling the breeze on his skin. Carefully,\nhe walked over to the lump that remained of the Fused. The corpse—or\nwhatever it was—looked dried out and fragile, the colors faded, like the\nshell of a snail long dead. The flesh had turned into some kind of stone,\nporous and light. Kaladin picked up the decapitated head and pressed his\nthumb into the face, which crumbled like ash. The rest of the body followed\non its own a few moments later, then even the carapace disintegrated.\nA line of violet-red light came streaking in from the side. Kaladin\nimmediately launched himself upward, narrowly avoiding the grasp of the\nFused that formed from the light beneath him. The creature, however,\nimmediately dropped the new body and shot upward after Kaladin as a\nlight. This time Kaladin dodged a little too slowly, and the creature—\nforming from the light—seized him by the leg.\nThe Fused heaved upward, using his powerful upper-body strength to\nclimb Kaladin’s uniform. By the time the Sylblade formed in Kaladin’s\nhands, the Fused had him in a powerful grip—legs wrapped around his\ntorso, left hand grabbing Kaladin’s sword hand and holding it out to the side\nwhile he shoved his right forearm into Kaladin’s throat. That forced his\nhead up, making it difficult to see the Fused, let alone get leverage against\nhim.\nHe didn’t need leverage, however. Grappling with a Windrunner was a\ndangerous prospect, for whatever Kaladin could touch, he could Lash. He\npoured Light into his enemy to Lash the creature away. The Light resisted,\nas it did when applied to Fused, but Kaladin had enough to push through the\nresistance.\nKaladin Lashed himself in the other direction, and it soon felt like\nenormous hands were pulling the two of them apart. The Fused grunted,\nthen said something in his own language. Kaladin dropped the Sylblade and\nfocused on trying to push the enemy away. The Fused was glowing with\nStormlight now; it rose off him like luminescent smoke.\nFinally the enemy’s grip slipped, then he shot away from Kaladin like an\narrow from a Shardbow. A fraction of a second later, that relentless red-\nviolet light darted from the chest and headed straight for Kaladin yet again.\nKaladin narrowly avoided it, Lashing himself downward as the Fused"

After missing, the Fused fell through the mists,\nvanishing. Again Kaladin found himself low on Stormlight, his heart racing.\nHe breathed in his third—of four—pouch of spheres. They’d learned to start\nwearing those sewn into the inside of their uniforms. Fused knew to try to\ncut away a Radiant’s sphere reserve.\n“Wow,” Syl said, hovering up beside Kaladin, naturally taking a position\nwhere she could watch behind him. “He’s good, isn’t he?”\n“It’s more than that,” Kaladin said, scanning the featureless fog. “He’s\nattacking with a different strategy than most. I haven’t done a lot of\ngrappling.”\nWrestling wasn’t often seen on the battlefield. At least not a disciplined\none. Kaladin was practiced with formations, and was growing more\nconfident with swordplay, but it had been years since he’d trained on how to\nescape a headlock.\n“Where is he?” Syl asked.\n“I don’t know,” Kaladin said. “But we don’t have to beat him. We only\nneed to stay out of his grasp long enough for the others to arrive.”\nIt took a few minutes of watching before Syl cried out. “There!” she\nsaid, forming a ribbon of light pointing the way toward what she’d seen.\nKaladin didn’t wait for further explanation. He Lashed himself away\nthrough the fog. The Fused appeared, but grasped empty air as Kaladin\ndodged. The creature’s body fell as the line of light ejected again, but\nKaladin began an erratic zigzag pattern, evading the Fused twice more.\nThis creature used Voidlight to form new bodies somehow. Each one\nlooked identical, with hair as a kind of clothing. He wasn’t being reborn\neach time—he was teleporting, but using the ribbon of light to transfer\nbetween locations. They’d met Fused that could fly, and others that had\npowers like Lightweavers. Perhaps this was the variety whose powers\nmirrored, in a way, the traveling abilities of Elsecallers.\nAfter the creature materialized the third time, he again briefly gave up\nthe chase. He can teleport only three times before he needs to rest, Kaladin\nguessed. He attacked in a burst of three each time. So after that, his powers\nneed to regenerate? Or … no, he probably needs to go somewhere and fetch\nmore Voidlight.\nIndeed, a few minutes later, the red-violet light returned. Kaladin Lashed\nhimself directly away from the light, picking up speed. Air became a roar\naround him, and by the fifth Lashing, he was fast enough that the red light\ncouldn’t keep up, and dwindled behind.\nNot quite so dangerous if you can’t reach me, are you? Kaladin thought.\nThe Fused evidently came to the same conclusion, the ribbon of light diving\ndownward through the fog.\nUnfortunately, the Fused probably knew Kaladin intended to return to\nHearthstone. So, instead of continuing, Kaladin flew down as well. He came\nto rest on a hilltop overgrown with lumpish rockbuds, their vines spilling\nout liberally in the humidity."

He came\nto rest on a hilltop overgrown with lumpish rockbuds, their vines spilling\nout liberally in the humidity.\nThe Fused stood at the bottom of the hill, looking up. Yes … that dark\nbrown wrap he wore was hair, from the top of his head, wound long and\ntight around his body. He broke a carapace spur off his arm—a sharp and\njagged weapon—and pointed it toward Kaladin. He had probably used one\nof those as a dagger when attacking Kaladin’s back.\nBoth spur and hair seemed to imply he couldn’t take objects with him\nwhen teleporting—so he couldn’t keep Voidlight spheres on his person, but\nhad to retreat to refill.\nSyl formed as a spear. “I’m ready,” Kaladin called. “Come at me.”\n“So you can run?” the Fused called in Alethi, his voice rough, like stones\ngrinding together. “Watch for me from the corner of your eye, Windrunner.\nWe’ll meet again soon.” He became a ribbon of red light—leaving another\ncrumbling corpse as he disappeared into the fog.\nKaladin sat down and let out a long breath, Stormlight puffing in front of\nhim and mingling with the fog. That fog would burn away as the sun rose\nhigher, but for now it still blanketed the land, making it feel eerie and\nforlorn. Like he had accidentally stepped into a dream.\nKaladin was hit with a sudden wave of exhaustion. The dull sense of\nStormlight running out, mixed with the usual deflation after a battle. And\nsomething more. Something increasingly common these days.\nHis spear vanished and Syl reappeared, standing in the air in front of\nhim. She’d taken to wearing a stylish dress, ankle-length and sleek, instead\nof the filmy girlish one. When he’d asked, she’d explained that Adolin had\nbeen advising her. Her long, blue-white hair faded to mist, and she didn’t\nwear a safehand sleeve. Why would she? She wasn’t human, let alone\nVorin.\n“Well,” she said, hands on hips, “we showed him.”\n“He almost killed me twice.”\n“I didn’t say what we showed him.” She turned around, keeping watch in\ncase this was a trick. “You all right?”\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said.\n“You look tired.”\n“You always say that.”\n“Because you always look tired, dummy.”\nHe climbed to his feet. “I’ll be fine once I get moving.”\n“You—”\n“We are not going to argue about this again. I’m fine.”\nIndeed, he felt better when he got up and drew in a little more\nStormlight. So what if the sleepless nights had returned? He’d survived on\nless sleep before. The slave Kaladin had been would have laughed himself\nsilly to hear that this new Kaladin—lighteyed Shardbearer, a man who\nenjoyed luxurious housing and warm meals—was upset about a little lost\nsleep.\n“Come on,” he said. “If we were spotted on our way here—”\n“If?”\n“—because we were spotted, they’ll send more than just one Fused.\nHeavenly Ones will come for me, and that means the mission is in jeopardy.\nLet’s get back to the town.”"

She’d spent more than a month wearing a fake face out here, making\nexactly the right comments to exactly the right people. And still no\nkidnapping. She hadn’t even been mugged. What was the world coming to?\nI could punch us in the face, Radiant noted, if it would make you feel\nbetter.\nLevity, from Radiant? Veil smiled as she pretended to browse a fruit\nstand. If Radiant was cracking jokes, they really were getting desperate.\nUsually Radiant was as funny as … as …\nUsually Radiant is as lighthearted as a chasmfiend, Shallan offered,\nbleeding to the front of their personality. One with a particularly large\nemerald inside …\nYes, that. Veil smiled at the warmth that came from Shallan, and even\nRadiant, who was coming to enjoy humor. This last year, the three of them\nhad settled into a comfortable balance. They weren’t as separate as they’d\nbeen, and swapped personas easily.\nThings seemed to be going so well. That made Veil worry, of course.\nWere they going too well?\nNever mind that, for now. She moved on from the fruit stand. She’d\nspent this month in the warcamps wearing the face of a woman named\nChanasha: a lowborn lighteyed merchant who had found modest success\nhiring out her chull teams to caravans crossing the Shattered Plains. They’d\nbribed the real woman to lend her face to Veil, and she now resided in a\nsecure location.\nVeil turned a corner and strolled down another street. The Sadeas\nwarcamp was much as she remembered it from her days living in these\ncamps—though it was somehow even rougher. The road needed a good\nscraping; rockbud polyps caused nearby wagons to rattle and bump as they\npassed. Most of the stalls had a guard prominently stationed near the goods.\nThis wasn’t the sort of place where you trusted the local soldiers to police\nfor you.\nShe passed more than a few luckmerches, selling glyphwards or other\ncharms against the dangerous times. Stormwardens trying to sell lists of\ncoming storms and their dates. She ignored these and moved on to a\nspecific shop, one that carried sturdy boots and hiking shoes. That was what\nsold well in the warcamps these days. Many customers were travelers\npassing through. A quick survey of the other merchants would tell the same\nstory. Rations that would keep for a long trip. Repair shops for wagons or\ncarts. And, of course, anything that wasn’t reputable enough to have a place\nat Urithiru."

And, of course, anything that wasn’t reputable enough to have a place\nat Urithiru.\nThere were also numerous slave pens. Nearly as many as there were\nbrothels. Once the bulk of the civilians moved to Urithiru, all ten warcamps\nquickly became a seedy stopover for caravans.\nAt Radiant’s prompting, Veil covertly checked over her shoulder for\nAdolin’s soldiers. They were well out of sight. Good. She did spot Pattern\nwatching from a wall nearby, ready to report to Adolin if needed.\nAll was in place, and their intelligence indicated her kidnapping should\nhappen today. Maybe she needed to prod a little more.\nThe shoe merchant finally approached her—a stout fellow who had a\nbeard striped with white. With that contrast, Shallan had an urge to draw\nhim, so Veil stepped back and let Shallan emerge to take a Memory of him\nfor her collection.\n“Is there anything that interests you, Brightness?” he asked.\nVeil emerged again. “How quickly could you get a hundred pairs of\nthese?” she asked, tapping one of the shoes with a reed Chanasha always\ncarried in her pocket.\n“A hundred pairs?” the man asked, perking up. “Not long, Brightness.\nFour days, if my next shipment arrives on time.”\n“Excellent,” she said. “I have a special contact with old Kholin at his\nsilly tower, and can unload a large number if you can get them to me. I’ll\nneed a bulk discount, of course.”\n“Bulk discount?” the man said.\nShe swiped her reed in the air. “Yes, naturally. If you want to use my\ncontacts to sell to Urithiru, I’ll need to have the very best deal.”\nHe rubbed at that beard of his. “You’re … Chanasha Hasareh, aren’t\nyou? I’ve heard of you.”\n“Good. You’ll know I don’t play games.” She leaned in and poked him\nin the chest with her reed. “I’ve got a way past old Kholin’s tariffs, if we\nmove quickly. Four days. Any way you can make it three?”\n“Perhaps,” he said. “But I am a law-abiding man, Brightness. Why … it\nwould be illegal to avoid tariffs.”\n“Illegal only if we accept that Kholin has authority to demand these\ntariffs. Last I checked, he wasn’t our king. He can claim whatever he wants,\nbut now that the storms have changed, the Heralds are going to show up and\nput him in his place. Mark my words.”\nNice work, Radiant thought. That was well handled.\nVeil tapped the reed on the boots. “A hundred pairs. Three days. I’ll send\na scribe to haggle details before the end of the day. Deal?”\n“Deal.”\nChanasha wasn’t the smiling type, so Veil didn’t favor this merchant\nwith one. She tucked her reed into her sleeve and gave him a curt nod\nbefore continuing through the market.\nYou don’t think it was too blatant? Veil asked. That last part about\nDalinar not being king felt over the top."

That last part about\nDalinar not being king felt over the top.\nRadiant wasn’t certain—subtlety wasn’t her strong suit—but Shallan\napproved. They needed to push harder, or she’d never get kidnapped. Even\nlingering near a dark alleyway—one she knew her marks frequented—drew\nno attention.\nStifling a sigh, Veil made her way to a winehouse near the market. She’d\nbeen coming here for weeks now, and the owners knew her well.\nIntelligence said they, like the shoe merchant, belonged to the Sons of\nHonor, the group Veil was hunting.\nThe serving girl brought Veil inside out of the cool weather to a small,\nout-of-the-way corner with its own table. Here she could drink in solitude\nand go over accounts.\nAccounts. Blah. She dug them out of her satchel and set them out on the\ntable. The lengths they went to in the name of staying in character. They\nhad to perfectly maintain the illusion, as the real Chanasha never let a day\ngo by without reconciling her accounts. She seemed to find it relaxing.\nFortunately, they had Shallan to handle this part; she had some practice\nwith Sebarial’s accounts. Veil relaxed, letting Shallan take over. And\nactually, this wasn’t so bad. She did doodles along the sides of the margins\nas she worked, even if it wasn’t quite in character. Veil acted like it was\nimperative that they keep absolutely in character at all times, but Shallan\nknew they needed to relax a little, now and then.\nWe could relax by visiting the gambling dens … Veil thought.\nPart of the reason they had to be so diligent was because these warcamps\nwere a tempting playground for Veil. Gambling without concern for Vorin\npropriety? Bars that would serve whatever you wanted, no questions asked?\nThe warcamps were a wonderful little storm away from Dalinar Kholin’s\nperfect seat of honesty.\nUrithiru was too full of Windrunners, men and women who would fall\nover themselves to make sure you didn’t bruise your elbow on a misplaced\ntable. This place, though. Veil could get to like this place. So, maybe it was\nbetter that they stayed strictly in character.\nShallan tried to focus on the accounts. She could do these numbers;\nshe’d first trained on accounting when doing her father’s ledgers. That had\nbegun before she …\nBefore she …\nIt might be time, Veil whispered. To remember, once and for all.\nEverything.\nNo, it was not.\nBut …\nShallan retreated immediately. No, we can’t think of that. Take control.\nVeil sat back in the seat as her wine arrived. Fine. She took a long drink\nand tried to pretend to be doing ledgers. Honestly, she couldn’t feel anger at\nShallan. She channeled it instead toward Ialai Sadeas. That woman couldn’t\nbe content with running a little fiefdom here, making a profit off the\ncaravans and keeping to herself. Oh no.

A short time later her brain started to feel fuzzy, and she almost\ndrew in Stormlight to burn off the effect—but stopped. She hadn’t ordered\nanything particularly intoxicating. So if she was getting light-headed …\nShe looked up, her eyes growing unfocused. They’d drugged the wine!\nFinally, she thought before slumping over in her seat.\n* * *\n“I don’t understand how hard it can be,” Syl was saying as she and Kaladin\ndrew close to Hearthstone. “You humans sleep literally every day. You’ve\nbeen practicing it all your lives.”\n“You’d think that, wouldn’t you,” Kaladin said, landing with a light step\nright outside town.\n“Obviously I would, since I just said so,” she replied, sitting on his\nshoulder, watching behind them. Her words were lighthearted, but he\nsensed in her the same tension he felt, like the air itself was stretched and\npulled tight.\nWatch for me from the corner of your eye, Windrunner. He felt a\nphantom pain from his neck, where the Fused had plunged his dagger into\nKaladin’s spine over and over.\n“Even babies can sleep,” Syl said. “Only you could make something so\nsimple into something extremely difficult.”\n“Yeah?” Kaladin asked. “And can you do it?”\n“Lie down. Pretend to be dead for a while. Get up. Easy. Oh, and since\nit’s you, I’ll add the mandatory last step: complain.”\nKaladin strode toward the town. Syl would expect a response, but he\ndidn’t feel like giving one. Not out of annoyance, but more … a kind of\ngeneral fatigue.\n“Kaladin?” she asked.\nHe’d felt a disconnect these last months. These last years … it was as if\nlife for everyone continued, but Kaladin was separate from them, incapable\nof interacting. Like he was a painting hanging in a hallway, watching life\nstream past.\n“Fine,” Syl said. “I’ll do your part.” Her image fuzzed, and she became a\nperfect replica of Kaladin, sitting on his own shoulder. “Well well,” she said\nin a growling, low-pitched voice. “Grumble grumble. Get in line, men.\nStorming rain, ruining otherwise terrible weather. Also, I’m banning toes.”\n“Toes?”\n“People keep tripping!” she continued. “I can’t have you all hurting\nyourselves. So, no toes from now on. Next week we’ll try not having feet.\nNow, go off and get some food. Tomorrow we’re going to get up before\ndawn to practice scowling at one another.”\n“I’m not that bad,” Kaladin said, but couldn’t help smiling. “Also, your\nKaladin voice sounds more like Teft.”\nShe transformed back and sat primly—clearly pleased with herself. And\nhe had to admit he felt more upbeat. Storms, he thought. Where would I be\nif I hadn’t found her?\nThe answer was obvious. He’d be dead at the bottom of a chasm, having\nleaped into the darkness.\nAs they approached Hearthstone, they found a scene of relative order."

He’d be dead at the bottom of a chasm, having\nleaped into the darkness.\nAs they approached Hearthstone, they found a scene of relative order.\nThe refugees had been returned to a line, and the warform singers who had\ncome with the Fused waited near Kaladin’s father and the new citylady,\ntheir weapons sheathed. Everyone seemed to understand that their next\nsteps would depend greatly upon the results of Kaladin’s duel.\nHe strode up and seized the air in front of him, the Sylspear forming as a\nmajestic silver weapon. The singers drew their weapons, mostly swords.\n“You can fight a Radiant all on your own, if you’d like,” Kaladin said.\n“Alternatively, if you don’t feel like dying today, you can gather the singers\nin this town and retreat a half hour’s walk to the east. There’s a stormshelter\nout that way for people from the outer farms; I’m sure Abiajan can lead you\nto it. Stay inside until sunset.”\nThe six soldiers rushed him.\nKaladin sighed, drawing in a few more spheres’ worth of his Stormlight.\nThe skirmish took about thirty seconds, and left one of the singers dead\nwith her eyes burned out while the others retreated, their weapons shorn in\nhalf.\nSome would have seen bravery in this attack. For much of Alethi history,\ncommon soldiers had been encouraged to throw themselves at\nShardbearers. Generals taught that the slightest chance of earning a Shard\nwas worth the incredible risk.\nThat was stupid enough, but Kaladin wouldn’t drop a Shard when killed.\nHe was Radiant, and these soldiers knew it. From what he’d seen, the\nattitudes of the singer soldiers depended greatly upon the Fused they\nserved. The fact that these had thrown their lives away so wantonly did not\nspeak highly of their master.\nFortunately, the remaining five listened to Abiajan and the other\nHearthstone singers who—with some effort—persuaded them that despite\nfighting bravely, they were now defeated. A short time later, they all went\ntrudging out through the quickly vanishing fog.\nKaladin checked the sky again. Should be close now, he thought as he\nwalked over to the checkpoint where his mother waited, a patterned\nkerchief over her shoulder-length unbraided hair. She gave Kaladin a side\nhug, holding little Oroden—who reached out his hands for Kaladin to take\nhim.\n“You’re getting tall!” he said to the boy.\n“Gagadin!” the child said, then waved in the air, trying to catch Syl—\nwho always chose to appear to Kaladin’s family. She did her usual trick,\nchanging into the shapes of various animals and pouncing around in the air\nfor the child.\n“So,” Kaladin’s mother said, “how is Lyn?”\n“Does that always have to be your first question?”\n“Mother’s prerogative,” Hesina said. “So?”\n“She broke up with him,” Syl said, shaped as a tiny glowing axehound.\nThe words seemed odd coming from its mouth. “Right after our last visit.”\n“Oh, Kaladin,” his mother said, pulling him into another side hug.\n“How’s he taking it?”"

With the dignity and respect I deserve.”\n“Has he been disrespecting you again, Syl?”\n“It’s been at least a day since he mentioned how great I am.”\n“It’s demonstrably unfair that I have to deal with both of you at once,”\nKaladin said. “Did that Herdazian general make it to town?”\nHesina gestured toward a nearby building nestled between two homes,\none of the wooden sheds for farming equipment. It didn’t appear terribly\nsturdy; some of the boards had been warped and blown loose by a recent\nstorm.\n“I hid them in there once the fighting started,” Hesina explained.\nKaladin handed Oroden to her, then started toward the shed. “Grab Laral\nand gather the townspeople. Something big is coming today, and I don’t\nwant them to panic.”\n“Explain what you mean by ‘big,’ son.”\n“You’ll see,” he said.\n“Are you going to go talk to your father?”\nKaladin hesitated, then glanced across the foggy field toward the\nrefugees. Townspeople had started to drift out of their homes to see what all\nthe ruckus was about. He couldn’t spot his father. “Where did he go?”\n“To check whether that parshman you sliced is actually dead.”\n“Of course he did,” Kaladin said with a sigh. “I’ll deal with Lirin later.”\nInside the shed, several very touchy Herdazians pulled daggers on him as\nhe opened the door. In response, he sucked in a little Stormlight, causing\nwisps of luminescent smoke to rise from his exposed skin.\n“By the Three Gods,” whispered one of them, a tall fellow with a\nponytail. “It’s true. You’ve returned.”\nThe reaction disturbed Kaladin. This man, as a freedom fighter in\nHerdaz, should have seen Radiants before now. In a perfect world, Dalinar’s\ncoalition armies would have been supporting the Herdazian freedom effort\nfor months now.\nOnly, everyone had given up on Herdaz. The little country had seemed\nclose to collapse, and Dalinar’s armies had been licking their wounds from\nthe Battle of Thaylen Field. Then reports had trickled in of a resistance in\nHerdaz fighting back. Each report sounded like the Herdazians were nearly\nfinished, and so resources were allocated to more winnable fronts. But each\ntime, Herdaz stood strong, relentlessly harrying the enemy. Odium’s armies\nlost tens of thousands fighting in that small, strategically unimportant\ncountry.\nThough Herdaz had eventually fallen, the blood toll exacted on the\nenemy had been remarkably high.\n“Which of you is the Mink?” Kaladin asked, glowing Stormlight puffing"

Kaladin\ncouldn’t make out his face beneath the hood.\n“I’m honored to meet the legend himself,” Kaladin said, stepping\nforward. “I’ve been told to extend you an official invitation to join the\ncoalition army. We will do what we can for your country, but for now\nBrightlord Dalinar Kholin and Queen Jasnah Kholin are both very eager to\nmeet the man who held against the enemy for so long.”\nThe Mink didn’t move. He remained seated, his head bowed. Finally,\none of his men moved over and shook the man’s shoulder.\nThe cloak shifted and the body fell limp, exposing rolls of tarps\nassembled to appear like the figure of a person wearing the cloak. A\ndummy? What in the Stormfather’s unknown name?\nThe soldiers seemed equally surprised, though the tall one merely sighed\nand gave Kaladin a resigned look. “He does this sometimes, Brightlord.”\n“Does what? Turns into rags?”\n“He sneaks away,” the man explained. “He likes to see if he can do it\nwithout us noticing.”\nOne of the other men cursed in Herdazian as he searched behind nearby\nbarrels, eventually uncovering one of the loose boards. It opened into the\nshadowed alley between buildings.\n“We’ll find him in town somewhere, I’m sure,” the man told Kaladin.\n“Give us a few minutes to hunt for him.”\n“One would think he’d avoid playing games,” Kaladin said, “considering\nthe dangerous situation.”\n“You … don’t know our gancho, Brightlord,” the man said. “This is\nexactly how he treats dangerous situations.”\n“He is no like being caught,” another said, shaking his head. “When in\ndanger, he is to vanish.”\n“And abandon his men?” Kaladin asked, aghast.\n“You don’t survive like the Mink has without learning to wiggle out of\nsituations others could never escape,” the tall Herdazian said. “If we were\nin danger, he’d try to come back for us. If he couldn’t … well, we’re his\nguards. Any of us would give our lives so he could escape.”\n“Is no like he needs us a lot,” another said. “The Ganlos Riera herself\ncouldn’t catch him!”\n“Well, locate him if you can, and pass along my message,” Kaladin said.\n“We need to be out of this town quickly. I have reason to suspect a larger\nforce of Fused is on its way here.”\nThe Herdazians saluted him, though that wasn’t necessary for a member\nof another country’s military. People did odd things around Radiants.\n“Well done!” Syl said as he left the shed. “You barely scowled when\nthey called you Brightlord.”\n“I am what I am,” Kaladin said, hiking out past his mother, who was\nnow conferring with Laral and Brightlord Roshone.

Kaladin spotted his\nfather organizing some of Roshone’s former soldiers, who were trying to\ncorral the refugees. Judging by the smaller line, a few seemed to have run\noff.\nLirin spotted Kaladin approaching, and his lips tightened. The surgeon\nwas a shorter man—Kaladin got his height from his mother. Lirin stepped\naway from the group and wiped the sweat from his face and balding head\nwith a handkerchief, then took off his spectacles, polishing them quietly as\nKaladin stepped up.\n“Father,” Kaladin said.\n“I had hoped,” Lirin said softly, “that our message would inspire you to\napproach covertly.”\n“I tried,” Kaladin said. “But the Fused have set up posts all through the\nland, watching the sky. The fog unexpectedly cleared up near one of those,\nand I was exposed. I’d hoped they hadn’t seen me, but…” He shrugged.\nLirin put his spectacles back on, and both men knew what he was\nthinking. Lirin had warned that if Kaladin kept visiting, he would bring\ndeath to Hearthstone. Today it had come to the singer who had attacked\nhim. Lirin had covered the corpse with a shroud.\n“I’m a soldier, Father,” Kaladin said. “I fight for these people.”\n“Any idiot with hands can hold a spear. I trained your hands for\nsomething better.”\n“I—” Kaladin stopped himself and took a long, deep breath. He heard a\ndistinctive thumping sound in the distance. Finally.\n“We can discuss this later,” Kaladin said. “Go pack up any supplies you\nwant to take. Quickly. We need to leave.”\n“Leave?” Lirin said. “I’ve told you already. The townspeople need me.\nI’m not going to abandon them.”\n“I know,” Kaladin said, waving toward the sky.\n“What are you…” Lirin trailed off as an enormous dark shadow emerged\nfrom the fog, a vehicle of incredible size flying slowly through the air. To\neither side, two dozen Windrunners—glowing bright with Stormlight—\nsoared in formation.\nIt wasn’t a ship so much as a gigantic floating platform. Awespren\nformed around Lirin anyway, like rings of blue smoke. Well, the first time\nKaladin had seen Navani make the platform float, he’d gaped too.\nIt passed in front of the sun, casting Kaladin and his father into shade.\n“You’ve made it quite clear,” Kaladin said, “that you and Mother won’t\nabandon the people of Hearthstone. So I arranged to bring them with us.”\nThe final step in capturing spren is the most tricky, as you must remove\nthe Stormlight from the gemstone.

The wars in Aimia\nwere in part over these seemingly innocent little creatures.\n—Lecture on fabrial mechanics presented by Navani Kholin to\nthe coalition of monarchs, Urithiru, Jesevan, 1175\nNavani Kholin leaned out over the side of the flying platform and looked\ndown hundreds of feet to the stones below. It said a lot about where she’d\nbeen living that she kept being surprised by how fertile Alethkar was.\nRockbuds clustered on every surface, except where they’d been cleared for\nliving or farming. Entire fields of wild grasses waved green in the wind,\nbobbing with lifespren. Trees formed bulwarks against the storms, with\ninterlocking branches as tight as a phalanx.\nHere—as opposed to the Shattered Plains or Urithiru—things grew. It\nwas the home of her childhood, but now it felt almost alien.\n“I do wish you wouldn’t crane like that, Brightness,” said Velat. The\nmiddle-aged scholar wore tight braids against the wind. She did try to\nmother everyone around her.\nNavani, naturally, leaned out farther. One would think that during more\nthan fifty years of life, she would have found a way to rise above her natural\nimpetuous streak. Instead she’d rather alarmingly found her way to enough\npower to simply do as she chose.\nBelow, her flying platform made a satisfyingly geometric shadow on the\nstones. Townspeople clustered together, gawking upward as Kaladin and the\nother Windrunners backed them off to provide room for the landing.\n“Brightlord Dalinar,” Velat said, “can you talk sense into her, please?\nShe’s going to drop right off, I swear it.”\n“It’s Navani’s ship, Velat,” Dalinar said from behind, his voice as steady\nas steel, as immutable as mathematics. She loved his voice. “I think she’d\nhave me thrown off if I tried to prevent her from enjoying this moment.”\n“Can’t she enjoy it from the center of the platform? Perhaps nicely\ntethered to the deck? With two ropes?”\nNavani grinned as the wind tugged at her loose hair. She held the rail\nwith her freehand. “This area is clear of people now. Send the order—a\nsteady descent to the ground.”\nShe’d started this design using old chasm-spanning bridges as a model.\nAfter all, this wasn’t a warship, but a transport intended to move large\ngroups of people. The end construction was little more than a large wooden\nrectangle: over a hundred feet long, sixty feet wide, and around forty feet\nthick to support three decks.\nThey had built high walls and a roof on the rear portion of the upper\ndeck.

        "text": "this isn’t the ocean. We’re flying.\nFlying. It had worked. Not just in maneuvers and tests on the Shattered\nPlains, but on a real mission, flying hundreds of miles.\nBehind her, over a dozen ardent engineers tended the open-air command\nstation. Ka—a scribe from one of the Windrunner squads—sent the order to\nUrithiru via spanreed. When in motion, they couldn’t write full instructions\n—spanreeds had trouble with that. But they could send flashes of light that\ncould be interpreted.\nIn Urithiru, another group of engineers worked the complex mechanisms\nthat kept this ship in the air. In fact, it used the very same technology that\npowered spanreeds. When one of them moved, the other moved in concert\nwith it. Well, halves of a gemstone could also be paired so that when one\nwas lowered, the other half—no matter where it was—would rise into the\nair.\nForce was transferred: if the distant half was underneath something\nheavy, you’d have trouble lowering yours. Unfortunately, there was some\nadditional decay; the farther apart the two halves were, the more resistance\nyou felt in moving them. But if you could move a pen, why not a guard\ntower? Why not a carriage? Why not an entire ship?\nSo it was that hundreds of men and chulls worked a system of pulleys\nconnected to a wide lattice of gemstones at Urithiru. When they let their\nlattice down along the side of the plateau outside the tower, Navani’s ship\nrose up into the sky.\nAnother lattice, secured on the Shattered Plains and connected to chulls,\ncould then be used to make the ship move forward or backward. The real\nadvancement had come as they’d learned to use aluminum to isolate motion\nalong a plane, and even change the vectors of force. The end result was\nchulls that could pull for a while, then be turned around—the gemstones\ntemporarily disjoined—to march back the other direction, as all the while\nthe airship continued in a straight line.\nAlternating between those two lattices—one to control altitude and a\nsecond to control horizontal movement—let Navani’s ship soar.\nHer ship. Her ship. She wished she could share it with Elhokar. Though\nmost people remembered her son only as the man who had struggled to\nreplace Gavilar as king, she’d known him as the curious, inquisitive boy\nwho had adored her drawings. He had always enjoyed heights. How he’d\nhave loved the view from this deck …\nWork on this vessel had helped sustain her during the months following\nhis death. Of course, it hadn’t been her math that had finally made this ship\na reality. They’d learned about the interactions between conjoined fabrials\nand aluminum during the expedition to Aimia. This wasn’t the direct result\nof her engineering schematics either; the ship was a fair bit more mundane\nin appearance than her original fanciful designs.\nNavani merely guided people smarter than she was. So maybe she didn’t\ndeserve to grin like a child as she watched it work. She did anyway.\nDeciding upon a name had taken her months of deliberation. In the end,\nhowever, she’d taken inspiration from the bridges that had inspired her. In\nspecific, the one that had—so many months ago—rescued Dalinar and"

In\nspecific, the one that had—so many months ago—rescued Dalinar and\nAdolin from certain death, something she hoped this vessel would do for\nmany others in similarly dire situations.\nAnd so, the world’s first air transport had been named the Fourth Bridge.\nWith the permission of Highmarshal Kaladin’s old team, she’d embedded\ntheir old bridge in the center of the deck as a symbol.\nNavani stepped away from the ledge and walked to the command station.\nShe heard Velat sigh in relief—the cartographer had tethered herself to the\ndeck with a rope. Navani would have preferred to bring Isasik, but he was\noff on one of his mapping expeditions, this time to the eastern part of the\nShattered Plains.\nStill, she had a full complement of scientists and engineers. White-\nbearded Falilar was reviewing schematics with Rushu while a host of\nassistants and scribes ran this way and that, checking structural integrity or\nmeasuring Stormlight levels in the gemstones. At this point, there wasn’t a\nwhole lot for Navani to do other than stand around and look important. She\nsmiled, recalling Dalinar saying something similar about battlefield generals\nonce the plan was in motion.\nThe Fourth Bridge set down, and the front doors of the bottom level\nopened to accept passengers. A dozen Edgedancers flowed out toward the\ntown. Glowing with Stormlight, they moved with a strange gait—\nalternating pushing off with one foot while sliding on the other. They could\nglide across wood or stone as if it were ice, and gracefully leaped over\nstones.\nThe last Edgedancer in the group—a lanky girl who seemed to have\ngrown an entire foot in the last year—missed her jump though, and tripped\nover a large rock the others had dodged. Navani covered a smile. Being\nRadiant did not, unfortunately, make one immune to the awkwardness of\npuberty.\nThe Edgedancers would usher the townspeople onto the transport and\nheal those who were wounded or sick. Windrunners darted through the sky\nto watch for potential problems.\nRather than bother the engineers or soldiers, Navani drifted over to\nKmakl, the Thaylen prince consort. Fen’s aging husband was a navy man,\nand Navani had thought he might enjoy joining them on the Fourth\nBridge’s first mission. He gave her a respectful bow, his eyebrows and long\nmustaches drooping alongside his face.\n“You must think us very disorganized, Admiral,” Navani said to him in\nThaylen. “No captain’s cabin and barely a handful of bolted-down desks for\na command station.”\n“She is an odd ship, to be sure,” the elderly sailor replied. “But majestic\nin her own way. I was listening to your scholars talk, and they were\nguessing the ship made about five knots on average.”\nNavani nodded. This mission had begun as an extended endurance test—\nindeed, Navani hadn’t been on the voyage when it had begun. The Fourth\nBridge had spent weeks flying out over the Steamwater Ocean, taking\nrefuge from storms in laits and coastal coves. During that time, the ship’s\nonly crew had been her engineers and a handful of sailors.\nThen the request had come from Kaladin. Would they like to try a more"

Would they like to try a more\nrigorous stress test by stealing an entire town out of Alethkar—rescuing an\ninfamous Herdazian general in the process? Dalinar had made the decision,\nand the Fourth Bridge had changed course toward Alethkar.\nWindrunners had delivered the command staff—Navani included—and\nRadiants to the vessel earlier today.\n“Five knots,” Navani said. “Not particularly fast, compared to your best\nships.”\n“Pardon, Brightness,” he said. “But this is essentially a giant barge—and\nfor that five knots is impressive, even ignoring the fact that it is flying.” He\nshook his head. “This ship is faster than an army marching at double time—\nyet it brings your troops in fresh and provides its own mobile high ground\nfor archery support.”\nNavani couldn’t refrain from beaming with pride. “There are still a lot of\nkinks to work out,” she said. “The fans on the rear barely increased speed.\nWe’re going to need something better. The manpower involved is\nenormous.”\n“If you say so,” he said. The elderly man adopted a distant expression,\nturning and staring out toward the horizon.\n“Admiral?” Navani asked. “Are you all right?”\n“I’m simply imagining the end of an era. The livelihood I’ve known, the\nway of the oceans and the navy…”\n“We’ll continue to need navies,” Navani said. “This air transport is\nmerely an additional tool.”\n“Perhaps, perhaps. But for a moment, imagine a fleet of ordinary ships\nsuffering an attack from one of these up above. It wouldn’t need trained\narchers. The flying sailors could drop stones and sink a fleet in minutes.…”\nHe glanced to her. “My dear, if these things become ubiquitous, it won’t\nonly be navies that are rendered obsolete. I can’t decide if I’m glad to be old\nenough to wish my world a fond farewell, or if I envy the young lads who\nget to explore this new world.”\nNavani found herself at a loss for words. She wanted to offer\nencouragement, but the past that Kmakl regarded with such fondness\nwas … well, like waves in water. Gone now, absorbed by the ocean of time.\nIt was the future that excited her.\nKmakl seemed to sense her hesitance, as he smiled. “Don’t mind the\nramblings of a grouchy old sailor. Look, the Bondsmith wishes your\nattention. Go and guide us toward a new horizon, Brightness. That is where\nwe’ll find success against these invaders.”\nShe gave Kmakl a fond pat on the arm, then hastened off toward Dalinar.\nHe stood near the front center of the deck, and Highmarshal Kaladin was\nstriding toward him accompanied by a bespectacled man. This must be the\nWindrunner’s father—though it took some imagination on her part to see\nthe resemblance. Kaladin was tall, and Lirin was short.

Lirin, on the other hand, was\nbalding, with the rest of his hair kept very short.\nHowever, as she stepped up beside Dalinar, she caught Lirin’s eyes—and\nthe familial connection became more obvious. That same quiet intensity,\nthat same faintly judgmental gaze that seemed to know too much about you.\nIn that moment she saw two men with the same soul, for all their physical\ndifferences.\n“Sir,” Kaladin said to Dalinar. “My father, the surgeon.”\nDalinar nodded his head. “Lirin Stormblessed. It is my honor.”\n“… Stormblessed?” Lirin asked. He didn’t bow, which Navani found\nundiplomatic, considering whom he was meeting.\n“I assumed you would take your son’s house name,” Dalinar said.\nLirin glanced at his son, who evidently hadn’t told him about his\nelevation. But he said nothing more, instead turning to give her airship a\nproper nod of respect.\n“This is a magnificent creation,” Lirin said. “Do you think it could\nquickly deliver a mobile hospital, staffed with surgeons, to a battlefield?\nThe lives that could be saved that way…”\n“An ingenious application,” Dalinar said. “Though Edgedancers\ngenerally do that job now.”\n“Oh. Right.” Lirin adjusted his spectacles, then finally seemed to find a\nlittle respect for Dalinar. “I appreciate what you’re doing here, Brightlord\nKholin, but can you say how long my people will be trapped on this\nvehicle?”\n“It will be a several-week flight to reach the Shattered Plains,” Dalinar\nsaid. “But we’ll be delivering supplies, blankets, and other items of comfort\nduring the trip. You’ll be performing an important function, helping us learn\nhow to better equip these transports. Plus we’ll be denying the enemy an\nimportant population center and farming community.”\nLirin nodded, thoughtful.\n“Why don’t you inspect the accommodations?” Dalinar offered. “The\nholds aren’t luxurious, but there’s space enough for hundreds.”\nLirin accepted the dismissal—though he again didn’t bow or offer\nrespect as he strode away.\nKaladin hung back. “I apologize for my father, sir. He doesn’t deal well\nwith surprises.”\n“It’s all right,” Dalinar said. “I can only imagine what these people have\nbeen through lately.”\n“It might not be over quite yet, sir. I was spotted while scouting earlier\ntoday. One of the Fused—a variety I’ve never seen before—came to\nHearthstone hunting me. I ran him off, but I have no doubt we’ll soon\nencounter more resistance.”\nDalinar tried to remain stoic, but Navani could see his disappointment in\nthe downturn of his lips. “Very well,” he said. “I’d hoped the fog might\ncover us, but that was plainly too convenient. Go alert the other\nWindrunners, and I’ll send word for the Edgedancers to hasten the\nevacuation.”\nKaladin nodded. “I’m running low on Light, sir.”\nNavani slipped her notebook from her pocket as Dalinar raised his hand"

        "text": "evacuation.”\nKaladin nodded. “I’m running low on Light, sir.”\nNavani slipped her notebook from her pocket as Dalinar raised his hand\nand pressed it against Kaladin’s chest. There was a faint … warping to the\nair around them, and for a moment she thought she could see into\nShadesmar. Another realm, filled with beads of glass and candle flames\nfloating in place of people’s souls. She thought, for the briefest moment, she\nheard a tone in the distance. A pure note vibrating through her.\nIt was gone in a moment, but she wrote her impressions anyway.\nDalinar’s powers were related to the composition of Stormlight, the three\nrealms, and—ultimately—the very nature of deity. There were secrets here\nto unlock.\nKaladin’s Light was renewed, wisps of it steaming off his skin, visible\neven in daylight. The spheres he carried would be renewed as well.\nSomehow Dalinar reached between realms to touch the Almighty’s own\npower, an ability once reserved solely for storms and the things that lived in\nthem.\nAppearing invigorated, the young Windrunner stepped across the deck.\nHe knelt and rested his hand on the rectangular patch of wood that stood out\nfrom the rest—not newly cut, but dinged and marked from arrows. His old\nbridge had been embedded to be flush with the rest of the deck. The Bridge\nFour Windrunners all enacted this same wordless ritual when they left the\nairship. It took only a moment, then Kaladin launched into the air.\nNavani finished her notes, covering a smile as she found Dalinar reading\nover her shoulder. That was still a decidedly odd experience, for all that she\ntried to encourage him.\n“I’ve already let Jasnah make notes on what I do,” Dalinar said. “Yet\neach time, you pull out this notebook. What are you looking for, gemheart?”\n“I’m not sure yet,” she said. “Something is odd about the nature of\nUrithiru, and I think Bondsmiths might be related to the tower, at least from\nwhat we read about the old Radiants.” She flipped to another page and\nshowed him some schematics she’d drawn. The tower city of Urithiru had\nan enormous gemstone construction at its heart—a crystal pillar, a fabrial\nunlike any she’d ever seen. She was increasingly certain the tower had once\nbeen powered by that pillar, as this flying ship was powered by the\ngemstones her engineers had embedded within the hull. But the tower was\nbroken, barely functioning.\n“I tried infusing that pillar,” Dalinar said. “It didn’t work.” He could\ninfuse Stormlight into ordinary spheres, but those tower gemstones had\nresisted.\n“We must be approaching the problem in the wrong way. I can’t help\nthinking if I knew more about Stormlight, the solution would be simple.”\nShe shook her head. The Fourth Bridge was an extraordinary\naccomplishment, but she worried she was failing in a greater task. Urithiru\nwas high in the mountains, where it was too cold to grow plants—yet the\ntower had numerous fields. People had not only survived up in that harsh\nenvironment, they had thrived.\nHow?

A spren on the level of the Nightwatcher or the\nStormfather—and capable of making a Bondsmith. She had to assume the\nspren, or perhaps something about its relationship with a human, had\nallowed the tower to function. Unfortunately, the Sibling had died during\nthe Recreance. She wasn’t certain what level of “dead” that meant. Was the\nSibling dead like the souls of Shardblades that still walked around? Some\nspren she interviewed said the Sibling was “slumbering,” but they treated\nthat as final.\nThe answers weren’t clear, and that left Navani struggling to try to\nunderstand. She studied Dalinar and his bond with the Stormfather, hoping\nit would offer some further clue.\n“So,” an accented voice said from behind them, “the Alethi really have\nlearned to fly. I should have believed the stories. Only your kind are\nstubborn enough to bully nature herself.”\nNavani started, though she was slower to respond than Dalinar, who\nspun—hand on his side sword—and immediately stepped between Navani\nand the strange voice. She had to peek around him to see the man who had\nspoken.\nHe was a short fellow, missing a tooth, with a flat nose and a jovial\nexpression. His worn cloak and ragged trousers marked him as a refugee.\nHe stood next to Navani’s engineer station, where he’d picked up the map\nthat charted the Fourth Bridge’s course.\nVelat, standing at the center of the desks, yelped when she saw him, then\nreached over to snatch the paper away.\n“Refugees are to gather belowdecks,” Navani said, pointing the way\nback to the steps.\n“Good for them,” the Herdazian man said. “Your flying boy says you’ve\ngot a place for me here. Don’t know what I think of serving an Alethi. I’ve\nspent most of my life trying to stay away from them.” He eyed Dalinar.\n“You specifically, Blackthorn. No offense.”\nAh, Navani thought. She’d heard that the Mink wasn’t what people\nexpected. She revised her assessment, then glanced toward the Cobalt\nGuardsmen who were belatedly rushing up from the sides of the ship. They\nappeared chagrined, but Navani waved them off. She’d ask some pointed\nquestions later about why they’d been so lax as to let this man sneak up the\nsteps to the command station.\n“I find wisdom in men who knew to avoid the person I once was,”\nDalinar said to the Mink. “But this is a new era, with new enemies. Our past\nsquabbles are of no concern now.”\n“Squabbles?” the man asked. “So that’s the Alethi word for them. Yes,\nyes. My mastery of your language, you see, is lacking. I’d been mistakenly\nreferring to your actions as ‘raping and burning my people.’”\nHe pulled something from his pocket. Another of Velat’s maps.

Use your flying\nmachine to rescue them, and we’ll talk. Alethi bloodlust has cost me many\nloved ones over the years, but I’d be a fool not to admit the value in\npointing it—like the proverbial sword’s blade—at someone else.”\n“It will be done,” Dalinar said.\nNavani didn’t miss that—despite claiming earlier that the Fourth Bridge\nwas her ship—he agreed to fly it per the Mink’s request without so much as\nconsulting her. She tried not to let things like that bother her. It wasn’t that\nher husband didn’t respect her—he’d proven on numerous occasions that he\ndid. Dalinar Kholin was simply accustomed to being the most important—\nand generally most capable—person around. That led a man to surge\nforward like an advancing stormwall, making decisions as the need arose.\nStill, it irked her more than she’d ever admit out loud.\nThe first of the real refugees began to arrive down below, herded gently\nby the Edgedancers. Navani focused on the problem at hand: making\ncertain each person was settled and comfortable in the most economical and\norderly way possible. She’d drawn up a plan. Unfortunately, the welcome\nwas interrupted as Lyn—a Windrunner woman with long dark hair worn in\na braid—slammed down onto the deck.\n“Incoming Fused, sir,” she reported to Dalinar. “Three full flights of\nthem.”\n“Kaladin was right, then,” he said. “Hopefully we can drive them away.\nStorms help us if they decide to harry the ship all the way to the Shattered\nPlains.”\nThat was Navani’s worst fear—that flying enemies would be able to\nstrike at and even disable the transport. She had precautions in place to try\nto prevent that, and it looked like she’d get to witness their initial test\nfirsthand.\nTo draw Stormlight out of a gemstone, I use the Arnist Method. Several\nlarge empty gemstones are brought close to the infused one while the\nspren is inspecting it. Stormlight is slowly absorbed from a small\ngemstone by a very large gemstone of the same type—and several\ntogether can draw the Light out quickly. The method’s limitation is, of\ncourse, the fact that you need not merely acquire one gemstone for\nyour fabrial, but several larger ones to withdraw the Stormlight.\nOther methods must exist, as proven by the extremely large\ngemstone fabrials created by the Vriztl Guild out of Thaylenah.

Her head kept bouncing\ninto the man’s back, pressing the sack against her face with each step. Deep\ndown, she felt satisfaction from Veil. They’d nearly given up on this\nmission. It was nice to know that all their work hadn’t been in vain.\nNow, where were they taking her? That had proven one of the biggest\nmysteries: where the Sons of Honor held their little meetings. Shallan’s\nteam had managed to get one person into the group months ago, but he\nhadn’t been important enough to be given the information they needed. A\nlighteyes had been required.\nThey suspected Ialai had taken over the cult, now that Amaram was\ndead. Her faction was planning to seize the Oathgate at the center of the\nShattered Plains. Unfortunately, Radiant didn’t have proof of these facts,\nand she would not move against Ialai without solid proof. Dalinar agreed\nwith her, particularly after what Adolin had done to Ialai’s husband.\nToo bad he didn’t find a way to finish off the pair of them, Veil thought.\nThat would not have been right, Radiant thought back. Ialai was no\nthreat to him then.\nShallan didn’t agree, and naturally Veil didn’t either, so Radiant let the\nmatter drop. Hopefully Pattern was still following at a distance as\ninstructed.

When she didn’t stir fast enough,\nsomeone dumped water on her head.\nIt was time for Veil to take over. She gasped “awake,” shoving aside her\nfirst instinct, which was to grab a knife and make short work of whoever\nhad drenched her. Veil wiped her eyes with her safehand sleeve, and found\nherself someplace dank and humid. Plants on the stone walls had pulled in\nat the ruckus, and the sky was a distant crack high in the air.

They’re for … parties.”\nForcing herself to stay in character, Veil gazed up with wonder and\nconfusion, then shied back against the chasm wall, startling a cremling with\ndark purple colorings.\nA figure at the front spoke first, his voice deep and resonant. “Chanasha\nHasareh, you have a fine and reputable name. After the legacy of\nChanaranach’Elin, Herald of the Common Man. Do you truly wish for their\nreturn?”\n“I…” Veil raised her hand before the light of the spheres. “What is this?\nWhat is happening?” And which one of you is Ialai Sadeas?\n“We are the Sons of Honor,” another figure said. Female this time, but\nnot Ialai. “It is our sworn and sacred duty to usher in the return of the\nHeralds, the return of storms, and the return of our god—the Almighty.”\n“I…” Veil licked her lips. “I don’t understand.”\n“You will,” the first voice said. “We’ve been watching you, and we find\nyour passion to be worthy. You wish to oust the false king, the Blackthorn,\nand see the kingdom rightfully returned to the highprinces? You wish the\njustice of the Almighty to fall upon the wicked?”\n“Of course,” Veil said.\n“Excellent,” the woman said. “Our faith in you is well placed.” Veil was\npretty sure that was Ulina, a member of Ialai’s inner circle. She’d initially\nbeen an unimportant lighteyed scribe, but was rapidly climbing the social\nladder in the new power dynamic of the warcamps.\nUnfortunately, if Ulina was here, Ialai probably was not. The\nhighprincess often sent Ulina to do things she did not wish to do herself.\nThat indicated Veil had failed in at least one of her goals: she hadn’t made\n“Chanasha” seem important enough to deserve special attention.\n“We guided the return of the Radiants,” the man said. “Have you\nwondered why they appeared? Why all of this—the Everstorm, the\nawakening of the parshmen—is happening? We orchestrated it. We are the\ngrand architects of the future of Roshar.”\nPattern would have enjoyed that lie.

You’re Radiant?”\n“We are something greater,” the man said. “But before we say more, you\nmust be initiated.”\n“I welcome any chance to serve,” Veil said, “but … this is quite sudden.\nHow can I be sure you’re not agents of the false king seeking to trap people\nlike me?”\n“All will be made clear in time,” the woman said.\n“And if I insist on proof?” Veil said.\nThe figures glanced at one another. Veil got the feeling they hadn’t\nencountered much resistance during their previous recruitments.\n“We serve the rightful queen of Alethkar,” the woman finally said.\n“Ialai?” Veil breathed. “Is she here?”\n“Initiation first,” the man said, gesturing to two others. They approached\nVeil—including a tall one whose robes came down only to midcalf. He was\nnotably rough as he grabbed her by the arms and hauled her upward, then\nrepositioned her on her knees.\nRemember that one, she thought as the other figure removed a glowing\ndevice from a black sack. The fabrial was set with two bright garnets, and\nhad a series of intricate wire loops.\nShallan was particularly proud of that design. And although Veil had\ninitially found it showy, she now recognized that was good for this group.\nThey seemed to trust it implicitly as they held it up to her and pressed some\nbuttons. The garnets went dark, and the figure proclaimed, “She bears no\nillusions.”\nSelling them that device had been delicious fun. Wearing the guise of a\nmystic, Veil had used the device to “expose” one of her Lightweavers in a\ncarefully planned scheme. Afterward Veil had charged them double what\nShallan had wanted—and the extravagant price had seemed only to make\nthe Sons believe in its power more. Almighty bless them.\n“Your initiation!” the man said. “Swear to seek to restore the Heralds,\nthe church, and the Almighty.”\n“I swear it,” Veil said.\n“Swear to serve the Sons of Honor and uphold their sacred work.”\n“I swear it.”\n“Swear to the true queen of Alethkar, Ialai Sadeas.”\n“I swear it.”\n“Swear you do not serve the false spren who bow before Dalinar\nKholin.”\n“I swear it.”\n“See,” the woman said, looking to one of her companions. “If she’d been\na Radiant, she couldn’t have sworn a false oath.”\nOh, you sweet soft breeze, Veil thought. Bless you for being so naive."

The Windrunners or Skybreakers\nmight have had trouble being so glib with a broken promise, but Shallan’s\norder was founded on the idea that all people lied, especially to themselves.\nShe couldn’t break an oath to her spren without consequences. But this\ngroup of human debris? She wouldn’t think twice about it—though Radiant\ndid express some discontent.\n“Rise, Daughter of Honor,” the man said. “Now, we must replace your\nhood and return you. But fear not; one of us will soon contact you with\nfurther instructions and training.”\n“Wait,” Veil said. “Queen Ialai. I need to see her to prove to myself\nwhom I’m serving.”\n“Perhaps you will earn this privilege,” the woman said, sounding smug.\n“Serve us well, and eventually you will receive greater rewards.”\nGreat. Veil braced herself for what that meant: more time in these\nwarcamps pretending to be a fussy lighteyed woman, carefully worming her\nway up through the ranks. It sounded dreadful.\nUnfortunately, Dalinar was genuinely concerned about Ialai’s growing\ninfluence. This little cult here might be gaudy and overacted, but it would\nbe unwise to let a martial presence grow unchecked. They couldn’t risk\nanother incident like Amaram’s betrayal, which had cost thousands of lives.\nBesides, Mraize considered Ialai to be dangerous. That was\nrecommendation enough for Veil to see the woman brought down. So she’d\nhave to keep working on this—and they’d therefore also have to find more\nways to sneak Adolin out to spend time with Shallan. The girl wilted if not\ngiven proper loving attention.\nFor her sake, Veil tried again. “I don’t know if waiting is wise,” she said\nto the others as the tall man prepared to replace her sack. “You should\nknow, I have connections to Dalinar Kholin’s inner circle. I can feed you\ninformation about his plans, if I’m properly incentivized.”\n“There will be time for that,” the woman said. “Later.”\n“Don’t you want to know what he’s planning?”\n“We already know,” the man said, chuckling. “We have a source far\ncloser to him than you.”\nWait.\nWait.\nShallan came alert. They had someone near Dalinar? Perhaps they were\nlying, but … could she risk that?\nWe need to do something, she thought. If Ialai had an operative in\nDalinar’s inner circle, it could be life-threatening. They didn’t have time for\nVeil to slowly infiltrate her way to the top. They needed to know who this\ninformant was now.\nVeil stepped back, letting Shallan take over. Radiant could fight, and Veil\ncould lie. But when they needed a problem solved quickly, it was Shallan’s\nturn.\n“Wait,” Shallan said, standing up and pushing aside the man’s hands as\nhe tried to shove the sack over her head. “I’m not who you think I am.”\nIf the Stormlight in a gemstone is withdrawn quickly enough, a nearby"

They hung in\nthe air like no skyeel ever could: motionless, equidistant.\nBelow, refugees stopped—despite the chaos of the evacuation—to stare\nup through the awespren at the sentinels in blue. There was something\nnatural about the way Windrunners swooped and banked, but it was another\nmatter altogether to be confronted by the surreal sight of a squad of soldiers\nhanging in the sky as if on wires.\nThe fog had mostly burned away, giving Kaladin a good view of the\nHeavenly Ones as they advanced in the distance. The enemy wore solid-\ncolored battle garb, muted save for the occasional bright crimson. They\nwore robes that trailed behind them several feet, even in battle. Those\nwould be impractical to walk in, but why walk when they could fly?\nThey’d learned much about the Fused from the Herald Ash. Each of\nthose Heavenly Ones was an ancient entity; ordinary singers had been\nsacrificed, giving up their bodies and lives to host a Fused soul. Each\napproaching enemy carried a long lance, and Kaladin envied the way they\nmoved with the winds. They did it naturally, as if they hadn’t merely\nclaimed the sky—as he had—but had instead been born to it. Their grace\nmade him feel like a stone tossed briefly into the air.\nThree flights would mean fifty-four members. Would Leshwi be among\nthem? He hoped she would, as they needed a rematch. He wasn’t certain\nhe’d be able to recognize her, as she’d died last time. He couldn’t claim\ncredit; Rock’s daughter Cord had done the deed with a well-placed arrow\nfrom her Shardbow.\n“Three flights is small enough we don’t need everyone,” Kaladin called\nto the others. “Squires beneath rank CP4, you drop to the ground and guard\nthe civilians—don’t pick a fight with a Fused unless they come at you first.\nThe rest of you, primary engagement protocol.”\nThe newer Windrunners dropped down to the ship with obvious\nreluctance, but they were disciplined enough not to complain. Like all\nsquires—including the more experienced ones he’d let remain in the air—\nthese hadn’t bonded their own spren, and therefore relied on having a\nnearby full Windrunner knight for their powers.\nKaladin had some three hundred Windrunners at this point—though only\naround fifty full knights. Almost all of the surviving original members of\nBridge Four had bonded a spren by now, as had many of the second wave—\nthose who had joined him soon after he had moved to Dalinar’s camp.

Even\nsome of the third wave—those who had joined the Windrunners after\nmoving to Urithiru—had found a spren to bond.\nThere, unfortunately, progress stopped. Kaladin had lines of men and\nwomen ready to advance and say the oaths, but there weren’t willing\nhonorspren to be found. At this point, there was only a single one he knew\nof who was willing, but didn’t have a bond.\nBut that was another problem for another time.\nLopen and Drehy moved up beside him, floating slowly, brilliant\nShardspears forming in their waiting hands. Kaladin reached overhead and\nseized his own spear as it formed from mist, then thrust it forward. His\nWindrunners broke apart, flying out to meet the approaching Heavenly\nOnes.\nKaladin waited. If Leshwi was among this force, she’d spot him. Ahead,\nthe first of the Heavenly Ones met Windrunners, proffering spears in\nchallenge. Each gesture was an offer of one-on-one combat. His soldiers\naccepted, instead of ganging up on the enemy. The layman might have\nfound that odd, but Kaladin had learned to use the ways of the Heavenly\nOnes and their ancient—some might say archaic—methods of fighting.\nThe paired Windrunners and Fused broke off to engage in contests of\nskill. The resulting confrontation looked like two streams of water crashing\ninto one another, then spraying to the sides. In moments, all of the\nWindrunners were engaged, leaving behind a handful of Fused.\nIn small-scale skirmishes, the Heavenly Ones preferred to wait for\nopportunities to fight one-on-one, instead of doubling up on enemies. It\nwasn’t always so—Kaladin had twice been forced to fight multiples at once\n—but the more Kaladin fought these creatures, the more he respected their\nways. He hadn’t expected to find honor among the enemy.\nAs he scanned the unengaged Fused, his eyes focused on one in\nparticular. A tall femalen with a stark red, black, and white skin pattern,\nmarbled like the turbulent mixing of three shades of paint. Though her\nfeatures were different, the pattern seemed much the same. Plus there was\nsomething about the way she held herself, and the way she wore her long\ncrimson and black hair.\nShe saw him and smiled, then held out her spear. Yes, this was Leshwi. A\nleader among the Fused—high enough that the others deferred to her, but\nnot so high that she stayed behind during fights. A status similar to\nKaladin’s own. He held out his spear.\nShe darted upward, and Kaladin swooped to follow. As he did, an\nexplosion of light expanded below. For a brief moment Kaladin glimpsed\nShadesmar, and he soared in a black sky marked by strange clouds flowing\nlike a roadway.\nA wave of power surged through the battlefield, causing Windrunners to\nburst alight. Dalinar had fully opened a perpendicularity, becoming a\nreservoir of Stormlight that would instantly renew any Radiant who drew\nnear.

She trailed\nwhite and red cloth behind her, slightly longer than the others’ garments; it\nflowed in a swooping, fluid response to her actions as she turned and curved\naround, leveling her spear at Kaladin and diving toward him.\nFully trained Windrunners had several important advantages in these\nbattles. They had much greater potential speed than the Heavenly Ones, and\nthey had access to Shardweapons. One might have thought these advantages\ninsurmountable, but the Heavenly Ones were ancient, practiced, and\ncunning. They had trained for millennia with their powers, and they could\nfly forever without running out of Voidlight. They only drained it to heal,\nand—he’d heard—to perform the occasional rare Lashing.\nAnd, of course, the Fused had a singular terrible edge over Kaladin’s\npeople: They were immortal. Kill them, and they’d be reborn in the next\nEverstorm. They could afford a recklessness that Kaladin could not. As he\nand Leshwi clashed—spears slamming together, each grunting as they tried\nto slide their weapon around and stab the other—Kaladin was forced to pull\naway first.\nLeshwi’s spear was lined with a silvery metal that resisted Shardblade\ncuts. More importantly, it was set with a gemstone at its base. If the weapon\nstruck Kaladin, that gemstone would suck away Kaladin’s Stormlight and\nrender him unable to heal—a potentially deadly tool against a Radiant, even\none infused by Dalinar’s perpendicularity.\nAs soon as Kaladin broke away, Leshwi dove deeper, trailing fluttering\ncloth. He followed, Lashing himself downward and plummeting through the\nbattlefield. A beautiful chaos, each pair dancing their own individual\ncontest. Leyten zipped past directly overhead, chasing a Heavenly One\ndressed in grey-blue. Skar shot beneath Kaladin, nearly colliding with Kara\nas she scored a hit on her opponent.\nOrange singer blood sprayed in the air, individual drops splashing\nKaladin on the forehead, other drops chasing him as he swooped toward the\nground. Kara didn’t have a Blade yet; she would have said the Third Ideal\nby now, he was certain. If only she had a spren.\nKaladin pulled up near the ground, skimming the stone by inches, orange\nblood raining down around him. Ahead, Leshwi dodged through a crowd of\nscreaming refugees.\nKaladin followed, darting between Leven the cobbler and his wife. Their\nhorrified screams, however, made him slow. He couldn’t risk colliding with\nbystanders. He flew up to the side, then pulled to a stop in the air, watching,\nanticipating.\nNearby, Lopen skimmed past. “You all right, gancho?” he called to\nKaladin.\n“I’m fine,” Kaladin said.\n“I can fight her if you want a breather!”\nLeshwi emerged on the other side, and Kaladin ignored Lopen, zipping\nafter.

He controlled his general direction with Lashings, using his\nhands, arms, and the contours of his body to govern fine motions. This\nmuch air rushing around him gave him the ability to sculpt his trajectory,\nalmost as if he were swimming.\nHe increased his speed with another Lashing, but Leshwi dodged down\nthrough the crowds again. Her recklessness almost cost her as she buzzed a\ngroup under the protection of Godeke the Edgedancer. He was a hair too\nslow, and his Shardblade only sliced off the end of her trailing robes.\nShe turned away from the people after that, though she stayed near the\nground. The Heavenly One couldn’t go as fast as a Windrunner, and so she\nfocused on sudden turns or weaving around obstacles—requiring Kaladin to\nmoderate his speed and remain unable to press one of his strongest\nadvantages.\nHe followed, the chase thrilling him in part because of how well Leshwi\nflew. She turned again, this time coursing in close to the Fourth Bridge. She\nslowed as they skimmed along the side of the enormous vehicle, and she\npeered at the wooden construction keenly.\nShe’s intrigued by the airship, Kaladin thought, following. She likely\nwants to gather as much information about it as she can. In Jasnah’s\ninterviews with the two Heralds—who had lived thousands of years—it had\ncome out that they too were amazed by this creation. As incredible as it\nseemed, modern artifabrians had discovered things that even the Heralds\nhadn’t known.\nKaladin broke off the chase for a moment, instead soaring over the top of\nthe large ship. He spotted Rock standing at the side of the vehicle with his\nson, delivering water to the refugees. When Rock saw Kaladin gesturing,\nthe large Horneater snatched a spear from a pile placed there and Lashed it\ninto the air. It shot up to Kaladin, who grabbed it, then Lashed himself after\nLeshwi.\nHe got on her tail again as she rose in a wild loop. She often tried to\nwear him down—leading him in intricate chases—before coming in to fight\nat close quarters.\nSyl, flying beside Kaladin, eyed the spear Rock had thrown. Despite the\nwind rushing in his ears, Kaladin heard her dismissive sniff. Well, she\ncouldn’t be infused with Stormlight. Trying to push it into her was like\ntrying to fill an already brimming cup with more water.\nThe next few turns strained Kaladin’s abilities to their fullest as Leshwi\ndove and dodged through the battlefield. Most of the others were engaged\ndirectly in duels, fighting with spear or Blade. Some led one another on\nchases, but none were as intricate as the weaving Kaladin was required to\ndo.\nHis focus narrowed. The other combatants became nothing more than\nobstacles in the air. His entire being, the fullness of his attention, fixated on\nchasing that figure ahead of him. The roaring air seemed to fade, and Syl\nshot ahead of him, leaving a trail of light—a beacon for Kaladin to follow."

The roaring air seemed to fade, and Syl\nshot ahead of him, leaving a trail of light—a beacon for Kaladin to follow.\nWindspren darted from the sky and fell in beside him as he curved in a\ngut-wrenching turn, spinning as Leshwi arrowed between Skar and another\nFused. Kaladin followed, sliding directly through the space between the two\nspears—narrowly avoiding being stabbed—then Lashed himself around to\nfollow Leshwi. Sweating, he gritted his teeth against the force of the turn.\nLeshwi glanced back at him, then dove. She was going to make another\npass at the Fourth Bridge.\nNow, Kaladin thought, pouring Light into his weapon as he dove after\nLeshwi. It tried to pull out of his hand, but he held it back even as he thrust\nit forward. As Leshwi neared the ground, he finally let go of the spear,\nlaunching it toward her.\nShe, unfortunately, glanced behind at just the right moment, allowing her\nto narrowly dodge the spear. It crashed to the ground, splintering, the head\nsmashed up into the shaft. Recovering, Leshwi pulled upward in a stunning\nmove, soaring past Kaladin, who—in the moment—lost concentration and\nnearly collided with the ground.\nHe landed roughly, catching himself on the stone—hard enough that\nhe’d have broken bones without Stormlight—then cursed and looked\nupward. Leshwi disappeared into the fight, leaving him behind with an\nexultant swirling maneuver in the sky. She seemed to revel in losing him\nwhen she could.\nKaladin groaned, shaking his hand where he’d hit the ground. His\nStormlight healed the sprain in moments, but it still hurt in a phantom way,\nlike the echoing of a loud noise in one’s mind after it left one’s ears.\nSyl appeared in the air before him in the shape of a young woman, hands\non her hips. “And don’t you dare return!” she shouted up at the departing\nFused. “Or we’ll … um … come up with a better insult than this one!” She\nglanced at Kaladin. “Right?”\n“You could have caught her,” Kaladin said, “if you’d been flying on your\nown without me.”\n“Without you, I’d be as dumb as a rock. And without me you’d fly like\none. I think we’re better off not worrying about what we could do without\nthe other.” She folded her arms. “Besides, what would I do if I caught her?\nGlare at her? I need you for the stabby-stabby part.”\nHe grunted, climbing to his feet. A moment later, a Radiant with a white\nbeard hovered down nearby. It was odd how much difference a small\nchange in perspective could make. Teft had always seemed … rumpled.\nBeard a little ragged, skin a little rough, mood a lot of both.\nBut hovering in the sky, the glow of Stormlight making his beard shine,\nhe seemed divine. Like a wise god from one of Rock’s stories.\n“Kaladin, lad?” Teft asked. “You all right?”\n“Fine.”\n“You sure?”\n“I’m fine. How’s the battlefield?”\n“Mostly quick engagements,” Teft said. “No casualties so far, thank\nKelek.”"

How’s the battlefield?”\n“Mostly quick engagements,” Teft said. “No casualties so far, thank\nKelek.”\n“They’re more interested in inspecting the Fourth Bridge than they are\nin killing us,” Kaladin said.\n“Ah, that makes sense,” Teft said. “Shall we try to stop them?”\n“No. Navani’s fabrials are hidden in the hold. A few flybys won’t tell the\nenemy anything.”\nKaladin surveyed the town, then studied the battlefield in the air. Rapid\nclashes, with the Heavenly Ones generally backing away quickly. “They\naren’t committed to a full assault; they’re testing our defenses and\nsurveying the flying machine. Spread the word. Have our Windrunners lead\nthe enemy in chases; have them fight defensively. Minimize our casualties.”\nTeft saluted as another group of townspeople was led up into the ship.\nRoshone ushered them on, and the old blowhard looked concerned for the\npeople under his care. Perhaps he’d been taking acting lessons with the\nLightweavers.\nAtop the ship, Dalinar glowed with a near impenetrable light. Though it\nwasn’t the enormous pillar of radiance he’d created the first time he’d done\nthis, today’s beacon was still powerful enough that it was difficult to look\ndirectly at it.\nIn the past, the Fused had focused their attacks on Dalinar. Today they\nbuzzed the ship—but didn’t try to strike at the Bondsmith. They were afraid\nof him for reasons nobody yet understood, and only committed to a full\nassault on him if they had overwhelming numbers and ground support.\n“I’ll pass the word,” Teft told Kaladin, but seemed hesitant about him.\n“You sure you’re well, lad?”\n“I’d be better if you’d stop asking.”\n“Right, then.” Teft shot into the sky.\nKaladin dusted himself off, eyeing Syl. First Lopen, then Teft, acting like\nhe was fragile. Had Syl told the others to keep watch over him? Just\nbecause he was feeling a tad tired lately?\nWell, he didn’t have time for that nonsense. A Heavenly One was\napproaching, red clothing fluttering, spear proffered toward him. It wasn’t\nLeshwi, but Kaladin was happy to accept the challenge. He needed to be up\nand flying again.\n* * *\nThe cultists froze, staring at Shallan through the eyeholes in their hoods.\nThe chasm fell silent, save for the noises of scuttling cremlings. Even the\ntall man with the sack didn’t move, though that wasn’t as surprising. He’d\nbe waiting for her to take the lead.\nI’m not who you think I am, Shallan had said, implying she was going to\nmake some startling revelation.\nNow she had to think of one.\nI’m really curious to see where this goes … Radiant thought at her.\n“I am no simple tradeswoman,” Shallan said. “You obviously don’t trust\nme yet—and I’m guessing you’ve seen the oddities about my lifestyle. You\nwant an explanation, don’t you?”\nThe two lead cultists glanced at one another.\n“Of course,” the woman said. “Yes, you should not have tried to hide\nthings from us.”"

Making a disturbance could be\ntactically dangerous.\nShe’d told Pattern and Adolin—who might be watching by now—that if\nshe was in distress, she’d create a distraction so they could attack. They’d\ntry to take the cultists captive, but it could lose them the chance to capture\nIalai.\nHopefully they’d see she wasn’t in distress, but was instead prying\ninformation out of these people.\n“Did you ever wonder why I disappear from the warcamps sometimes?”\nShallan asked. “And why I have far more money than I should? I have a\nsecond business, a hidden one. With the help of agents at Urithiru, I’ve been\ncopying schematics the Kholin artifabrians have been developing.”\n“Schematics?” the woman said. “Like what?”\n“Surely you’ve heard news of the enormous flying platform that left\nNarak a few weeks ago. I have the plans. I know exactly how it was done.\nI’ve sold smaller fabrial schematics to Natan buyers, but nothing on this\nlevel. I’ve been searching for a buyer of enough means to purchase this\nsecret.”\n“Selling military secrets?” the male cultist said. “To other kingdoms?\nThat is treason!”\nSays the man wearing a silly hood and trying to depose the Kholin\nmonarchy, Veil thought. These people …\n“It’s only treason if you accept Dalinar’s family as rightful rulers,”\nShallan said to him. “I do not. But if we can truly help House Sadeas assert\nitself … These secrets could be worth thousands of broams. I would share\nthem with Queen Sadeas.”\n“We will take them to her,” the woman said.\nRadiant affixed her with a calculated stare, level and calm. A leader’s\nstare, one Shallan had sketched a dozen times over as she watched Dalinar\ninteract with people. The stare of one in power, who didn’t need to say it.\nYou will not take this from me, the stare said. If you want favor for\nhaving been involved in this revelation, you’ll do it by assisting me—not by\ntaking it for yourself.\n“I’m certain that someday this might—” the man began.\n“Show me,” the woman said, interrupting him.\nHooked, Veil thought. Nice work, you two.\n“I’ve got some of the plans in my satchel,” Shallan said.\n“We searched the satchel,” the woman said, waving to a nearby cultist to\nproduce the bag. “There were no plans.”\n“You think I’d be foolish enough to leave them where they could be\ndiscovered?” Shallan said, taking the satchel. She dug inside and covertly\ntook a quick breath of Light as she pulled out a small notebook. She flipped\nto a rear page, then took out a charcoal pencil. Before the others could\ncrowd around, she breathed out carefully, snapping a Lightweaving in\nplace.

As she carefully rubbed her\ncharcoal across the page, it seemed to reveal a hidden schematic.\nYour turn, Shallan said as Veil took over.\n“You trace the schematic on a piece of paper above this one,” Veil\nexplained, “and press very hard. That leaves an indentation in the page. A\nlight brush of charcoal reveals it. This isn’t the entire thing, naturally; I\nkeep it as proof for potential buyers.”\nShallan felt a little stab of pride at the complicated illusion. It appeared\nexactly as she wanted it to, making a complicated series of lines and\nnotations appear magically on the page as she did the rubbing.\n“I can’t make any sense of that,” the man complained.\nThe woman, however, leaned closer. “Replace her sack,” the woman\nsaid. “We’ll bring the matter to the queen. This might be interesting enough\nfor her to grant an audience.”\nVeil steeled herself as a cultist snatched away her notebook, probably to\ntry applying charcoal to the other pages, which would of course do nothing.\nThe tall man pulled the sack over her head, but as he did so he leaned close.\n“What now?” he whispered to Veil. “This feels like trouble.”\nDon’t break character, Red, she thought, bowing her head. She needed to\nget to Ialai and discover if the woman really did have a spy in Dalinar’s\ncourt. That meant taking a few risks.\nRed was the first one they’d embedded into the Sons of Honor, but his\npersona—that of a darkeyed workman—hadn’t been important enough to\nget any real access. Hopefully, together they could—\nShouts rose nearby in the chasm. Veil spun, blinded by the sack. Storms\nalight. What was that?\n“We’ve been followed,” the male leader of the conspirators said. “To\narms! Those are Kholin troops!”\nDamnation, Veil thought. Radiant was right.\nAdolin, seeing her sack replaced, had decided it was time to take this\ngroup captive and cut their losses.\n* * *\nKaladin traded blows with his enemy, landing one hit, then another. As he\ncame back around, the Heavenly One thrust down with his lance. But\nKaladin had drilled spearplay until he could practically fight in his sleep.\nHovering in the air, surging with Stormlight, his body knew what to do and\ndeflected the thrust.\nKaladin made his own lunge, scoring another hit. As they danced, they\nrotated around one another. Much of Kaladin’s formal training had been\nwith spear and shield, intended for formation tactics, but he’d always loved\nthe longspear, wielded two-handed. There was a power to it, a control. He\ncould move the weapon so much more deftly this way.\nThis Heavenly One wasn’t as good as Leshwi. Kaladin scored yet\nanother slice along the enemy’s arm. The Shardspear did no physical\ndamage other than greying the flesh around where the cut would have been."

The Shardspear did no physical\ndamage other than greying the flesh around where the cut would have been.\nIt soon healed, but each healing came more slowly. The enemy’s Voidlight\nwas running out.\nThe enemy started humming one of the Fused songs, gritting his teeth as\nhe tried to spear Kaladin. They saw Kaladin as a challenge, a test. Leshwi\nalways got to fight Kaladin first, but if he disengaged or defeated her,\nanother was always waiting. A part of him wondered if this was why he was\nso tired lately. Even little skirmishes were a slog, never giving him a break.\nA deeper part of him knew that wasn’t the reason at all.\nHis enemy prepared to strike, and Kaladin reached with his off hand for\none of his belt knives, then whipped it into the air. The Fused overreacted\nand fumbled his defense. That let Kaladin score a spear hit along the thigh.\nDefeating a Fused was a test in endurance. Cut them enough, and they\nslowed. Cut them more, and they stopped healing entirely.\nHis opponent’s humming grew louder, and Kaladin sensed the wounds\nweren’t healing any longer. Time to go for the kill. He dodged a strike—\nthen changed Syl into a hammer, which he swung down on the enemy’s\nweapon, smashing it. The powerful blow threw the Heavenly One\ncompletely off balance.\nKaladin dropped the hammer and thrust his hands forward; Syl was\ninstantly a spear, steady in his grip. His aim was true, and he speared the\nenemy right through the arm. The Fused grunted as Kaladin whipped the\nspear out by reflex, then spun it around and leveled it at the enemy’s neck.\nThe Fused met his eyes, then licked his lips, waiting. The creature began\nto slowly drop from the sky, his Light expended, his powers failing.\nKilling him does no good, Kaladin thought. He’ll simply be reborn. Still,\nthat was one Fused out of combat for a few days at least.\nHe’s out anyway, he thought as the creature’s arm flopped down at his\nside, useless and dead from the Shardspear cut. What good is another\ndeath?\nKaladin lowered his spear, then gestured to the side. “Go,” he said. Some\nof them understood Alethi.\nThe Fused hummed a different tone, then raised his broken spear to\nKaladin—holding it in his off hand. The Heavenly One dropped the weapon\ntoward the rocks below. The creature bowed his head to Kaladin, then\ndrifted away.\nNow, where had—\nA ribbon of red light streaked in from the side.\nKaladin immediately Lashed himself backward and spun, weapon out.\nHe hadn’t realized he’d been dedicating a part of his energy to watching for\nthat red light.\nIt darted away from him now that he’d noticed it.

The fog was all but gone, letting him scan the\nentirety of Hearthstone—a little cluster of homes bleeding people toward\nthe Fourth Bridge in a steady stream. The citylord’s manor stood on the\nhilltop at the far edge of town, overlooking them all. It had once seemed so\nlarge and imposing to Kaladin.\n“Did you see that light?” he asked Syl.\nYes. That was the Fused from before. When she was a spear, her words\ncame directly into his mind.\n“My quick reaction scared it away,” Kaladin said.\n“Kal?” a feminine voice called. Lyn came swooping in, wearing a\nbrilliant blue Alethi uniform, Stormlight puffing from her lips as she spoke.\nShe wore her long dark hair in a tight braid, and carried a functional—but\nordinary—lance under her arm. “You all right?”\n“I’m fine,” he said.\n“You sure?” she said. “You seem distracted. I don’t want anyone\nstabbing you in the back.”\n“Now you care?” he snapped.\n“Of course I do,” she said. “Not wanting us to be more doesn’t mean I\nstopped caring.”\nHe glanced at her, then had to turn away because he could see genuine\nconcern in her face. Their relationship hadn’t been right. He knew that as\nwell as she did, and the pain he felt wasn’t for the end of that. Not\nspecifically.\nIt was simply one more thing weighing him down. One more loss.\n“I’m fine,” he said, then glanced to the side as he felt the power from\nDalinar end. Was something wrong?\nNo, the time had merely passed. Dalinar generally didn’t keep his\nperpendicularity open for entire battles, but instead used it periodically to\nrecharge spheres and Radiants. Holding it open was taxing for him.\n“Run a message to the other Windrunners in the air,” Kaladin said to\nLyn. “Tell them I spotted that new Fused, the one I told them about earlier.\nHe moved toward me as a ribbon of red light—like a windspren, but the\nwrong color. He can fly incredibly quickly, and could strike at one of us up\nhere.”\n“Will do…” she said. “If you’re sure you don’t need any help…”\nKaladin pointedly ignored that comment and dropped toward the ship.\nHe wanted to make sure Dalinar was being watched, in case the strange\nnew Fused came after him.\nSyl landed on his shoulder and rode downward with her hands primly on\nher knees.\n“The others keep checking on me,” Kaladin said to her, “like I’m some\ndelicate piece of glasswork ready to fall off the shelf at any moment and\nbreak. Is that your doing?”\n“What? That your team is considerate enough to watch out for one\nanother? That would be your fault, I’d say.”\nHe landed on the deck of the ship, then turned his head and looked\nstraight at her.\n“I didn’t say anything to them,” she told him. “I know how anxious the\nnightmares make you. It would be worse if I told anyone about them.”\nGreat. He hadn’t liked the idea of her talking to the others, but at least it\nwould have explained why everyone was acting so strangely. He crossed"

He hadn’t liked the idea of her talking to the others, but at least it\nwould have explained why everyone was acting so strangely. He crossed\nover to Dalinar, who was speaking with Roshone, who had come up from\nbelow.\n“The town’s new leaders keep prisoners in the manor’s stormcellar,\nBrightlord,” Roshone was saying, pointing at his former dwelling. “There\nare currently only two people there, but it would be a crime to abandon\nthem.”\n“Agreed,” Dalinar said. “I’ll send one of the Edgedancers to free them.”\n“I will accompany them,” Roshone said, “with your permission. I know\nthe layout of the building.”\nKaladin sniffed. “Look at him,” he whispered to Syl, “acting like some\nhero now that Dalinar is around to impress.”\nSyl reached up and flicked Kaladin on the ear, and he felt a surprisingly\nsharp pain, like a jolt of power.\n“Hey!” he said.\n“Stop being a stumer.”\n“I’m not being a … What’s a stumer?”\n“I don’t know,” Syl admitted. “It’s a word I heard Lift using. Regardless,\nI’m pretty sure you’re being one right now.”\nKaladin glanced at Roshone, who headed toward the manor with\nGodeke. “Fine,” Kaladin said. “He has maybe improved. A little.”\nRoshone was the same petty lighteyes he’d always been. But during this\nlast year, Kaladin had seen another side to the former citylord. He seemed\nto legitimately care. As if realizing, only now, his responsibility.\nHe’d still gotten Tien killed. For that, Kaladin didn’t think he could ever\nforgive Roshone. At the same time, Kaladin didn’t intend to forgive himself\nfor that loss either. So at least Roshone was in good company.\nRock and Dabbid were helping the refugees, so Kaladin told them he’d\nseen the strange Fused again. Rock nodded, understanding immediately. He\nwaved to his older children—including Cord, who carried Amaram’s old\nShardbow strapped to her back and wore the full set of Shardplate she’d\nfound in Aimia.\nTogether they moved in a not-so-subtle way over near Dalinar, keeping a\nwatch on the sky for red lines of light. Kaladin glanced upward as one of\nthe Heavenly Ones shot past, chased by Sigzil.\n“That’s Leshwi,” Kaladin said, launching into the air.\nWith a captured spren, you may begin designing a proper fabrial.

As she’d feared, he’d come to rescue her.\nRadiant considered pulling off the hood, summoning her Shardblade,\nand demanding the conspirators surrender. However, she acknowledged\nwhat Veil and Shallan wanted. They needed to meet Ialai face-to-face.\nA scraping sounded nearby. Radiant turned toward it. Rock on rock.\nAnd … some sort of mechanism turning?\nShe strode blindly toward the sound. “Bring me,” she shouted. “Don’t\nleave me to them!”\n“Fine,” Ulina said from somewhere nearby. “You two, grab her. You,\nguard the doorway from inside. Try to jam the mechanism closed.\nQuickly!”\nRough hands grabbed Radiant by the shoulders and pulled her along,\nsteering her into what sounded—from the echoing footsteps—like a tunnel.\nStone ground on stone behind them, cutting off the noise of the skirmish in\nthe chasm. At least she knew how the cultists were getting in and out of the\nchasms. Radiant stumbled and purposefully fell to her knees so she could\nput her hands on the ground. Smooth, cut rock. Done with a Shardblade, she\nsuspected.\nThe others forced her to her feet and pushed her up an incline. They\ndidn’t remove the sack, even when she protested that it wasn’t necessary.\nWell, a tunnel made sense. This warcamp had been occupied by Sadeas\nand Ialai for years before everyone else moved to Urithiru. They would\nhave wanted a secret escape route from their warcamp, particularly during\nthe early years on the Plains when everyone—Adolin said—had been so\ncertain the princedoms would shatter apart and start fighting one another.\nThe tunnel eventually reached another door, and this one opened into\nwhat sounded like a small room. A cellar perhaps? Those weren’t common\non the Shattered Plains—too easy to flood—but the richer lighteyes had\nthem for chilling wine.\nThe conspirators muttered to themselves about what to do. Four people.\nJudging by the sounds of rustling cloth, they were removing their robes.\nProbably had ordinary clothing underneath. Red wasn’t here; he’d have\nsqueezed her arm to let her know. So she was alone.\nThe others eventually hauled her up some steps and then outside; she felt\nwind on her hands and warm sunlight on her skin. She pretended to be\npliable and easy to move, though she waited—ready to attack—in case this\nwas some kind of ruse, and she was assaulted.\nThey led her through the streets quickly, the hood still on. Shallan took\nover, as she had an incredible—likely supernatural—ability to sense and\nmemorize direction. She mapped their path in her head. Sneaky little\ncremlings; they led her in a large double loop, ending at a location near\nwhere they’d emerged from the cellar.\nThe hike up had taken only a few minutes, so they had to be near the\neastern edge of the warcamp. Perhaps the fortress there?

Judging by how upset they\nseemed as they finally pulled her into a building, they weren’t thinking very\nclearly. They forced her down into a chair, then left, boots thumping on\nwood.\nShe soon heard them arguing in a nearby room. Carefully, Veil reached\nup and removed her hood. The cultist left guarding her—a tall man with a\nscar on his chin—didn’t demand she replace it. She was sitting in a stiff\nwooden chair right inside the door of a stone room with a large circular rug.\nThe rug didn’t do much to liven the otherwise bare chamber. These\nwarcamp buildings were so fortresslike: few windows, little ornamentation.\nShallan had always viewed Sadeas as a blowhard. A fortress like this—\nand the escape tunnel she’d traveled through—made Veil revise that\nassessment. She sifted through Shallan’s memories, and what Veil saw in\nthe man was pure craftiness.\nShallan didn’t have many memories of Ialai, but Veil knew enough to be\ncareful. Highprince Thanadal had started this new “kingdom” at the\nwarcamps. But soon after Ialai had set up here, Thanadal had been found\ndead, supposedly knifed by a prostitute. Vamah—the other highprince who\nhadn’t supported Dalinar—had fled the warcamps in the night. He seemed\nto believe Ialai’s lie that Dalinar had ordered the assassination.\nThat left Ialai Sadeas the one true remaining power here in the\nwarcamps. She had an army, had co-opted the Sons of Honor, and was\ndemanding tariffs from arriving trade caravans. This woman remained a\nthorn, a reminder of the old Alethkar full of squabbling lighteyes always\neyeing one another’s lands.\nVeil listened as best she could to the arguments coming from the next\nroom; the conspirators seemed frustrated that they’d lost so many in the\nstrike. They seemed frantic, and worried that it was “all falling apart.”\nAt last, the door swung open and three people stormed out. Veil\nrecognized Ulina, the woman she’d suspected earlier from her voice. They\nwere followed by a lighteyed soldier in Sadeas colors.\nThe guard gestured for Veil to enter, so she rose and carefully poked her\nhead into the room. It was larger than the antechamber, with very narrow\nwindows. Despite the attempt to soften it with a rug, couches, and pillows,\nit still felt like a fortress. A place for lighteyes to hole up in during storms or\nto fall back to if attacked.\nIalai Sadeas sat at a table on the far side of the room, shrouded in\nshadows, away from the windows and the glowing sphere lamps on the\nwalls. Near to her sat a large hutch with a roll top covering its front.\nAll right, Veil thought, walking forward. We’ve found her. Have we\ndecided what we’re going to do with her?"

Have we\ndecided what we’re going to do with her?\nShe knew Radiant’s vote: get her to say something incriminating, then\nbring her in. Veil, however, hadn’t pushed this mission solely to gather\nevidence for Dalinar. She hadn’t even done it because the Ghostbloods saw\nIalai as a threat. Veil had done it because this woman stubbornly continued\nto jeopardize everything Shallan loved.\nDalinar and Jasnah needed to keep their eyes on the real prize:\nreclaiming Alethkar. And so, Veil had determined to snip this particular\nloose thread. Adolin had killed Highprince Sadeas in a moment of honest\npassion. Veil had come to finish the job he’d begun.\nToday Veil intended to assassinate Ialai Sadeas.\n* * *\nThe hardest thing in the world for Kaladin to do was nothing. It was\nexcruciating to watch one of his soldiers fight for his life against a skilled,\ndangerous opponent—and do nothing to help.\nLeshwi was a being of incredible age, the spirit of a singer long dead\nturned into something more akin to a spren—a force of nature. Sigzil was a\ncapable fighter, but far from the order’s best. His true talents lay in his\nunderstanding of numbers, his knowledge of other cultures, and his ability\nto remain focused and practical in situations where others lost their heads.\nHe was quickly forced onto the defensive. Leshwi loomed over him—\nthrusting down with her spear—then swung around and stabbed from the\nside. She expertly flowed from one attack to the next, forcing Sigzil to keep\nspinning around, barely deflecting or dodging her strikes.\nKaladin Lashed himself forward, fingers tight on his spear. It was vital\nhis team keep to the Heavenly Ones’ sense of honor. So long as the enemy\nagreed to one-on-one combat, his soldiers were never in danger of being\noverwhelmed and wiped out.\nThe forces on the ground might mercilessly brutalize one another, but up\nhere—in the skies—they’d found mutual respect. The respect of combatants\nwho would kill one another, but as part of a contest, not a slaughter. Break\nthat unspoken rule, gang up on Leshwi now, and that precarious balance\nwould end.\nLeshwi shot forward and speared Sigzil in the chest. Her weapon\nimpaled him straight through, bursting from the back of his blue uniform,\nslick with blood. He struggled, gasping, Stormlight leaking from his mouth.\nLeshwi hummed a loud tone, and the gemstone on her spear began to glow,\nsucking Stormlight from her prey.\nKaladin groaned, the deaths of so many he’d failed flashing before him.\nTien? Nalma? Elhokar?\nHe was again in that terrible nightmare at the Kholinar palace, where his\nfriends killed one another. Screams and lights and pain and blood all\nswirled around one image: a man Kaladin was sworn to protect, lying on\nthe floor.\nMoash’s spear straight through him.\n“No!” Kaladin shouted.

He\nLashed himself forward, but Leshwi met his eyes. He paused.\nShe yanked her spear from Sigzil’s chest right before his Stormlight\nwent out. Sigzil sagged in the air, and Kaladin grabbed him, holding him as\nhe blinked in a daze, clutching his silvery Shardspear.\n“Drop your weapon,” Kaladin said to him, “and bow to her.”\n“What? Sir?” Sigzil frowned as his wound healed.\n“Drop your spear,” Kaladin said, “and bow to her.”\nSigzil, looking confused, did as he requested. Leshwi nodded to him in\nturn.\n“Go back to the ship,” Kaladin said, “and sit out the rest of this battle.\nStay with the squires.”\n“Um, yes, sir,” Sigzil said. He floated off, poking at the bloody hole in\nhis jacket.\nLeshwi glanced to the side. A short distance away—hanging in the air\nwith no weapon—was the Heavenly One that Kaladin had defeated earlier.\nLeshwi shouldn’t care that Kaladin had spared the creature. It had been a\nfoolish gesture toward a being who could be reborn with each new storm.\nThen again, Leshwi probably knew that if Sigzil were killed, a new Radiant\ncould be raised up using his spren. It wasn’t exactly the same— in fact, in\nterms of Kaladin’s relief, there was a huge difference.\nAt any rate, as Leshwi raised her spear to him, he was glad to accept the\nchallenge.\n* * *\nIn the middle deck of the Fourth Bridge, Navani counted off another family\nand pointed them toward a clearly marked and numbered section of the\nhold. The ardents there were quick to provide comfort to the worried family.\nWide-eyed children clutching blankets settled in, several of them sniffling.\nParents arranged sacks with the clothing and other possessions they’d\nhastily packed.\n“Some few are refusing to leave,” Ardent Falilar said quietly to Navani.\nHe fretted at his pure white beard as he looked over the list of names.\n“They’d rather continue living in oppression than abandon their homeland.”\n“How many?” she asked.\n“Not many. Fifteen people. Otherwise the evacuation is going faster than\nI’d estimated. The refugees, obviously, were already prepared to move—\nand most of the normal townspeople had already been forced into close\nquarters with their neighbors to give parshmen their dwellings.”\n“Then what are you so worried about?” Navani asked, making a notation\non her list. Nearby, Renarin had stepped up to the family with the sniffling\nchildren. He summoned a small globe of light, then began bouncing it\nbetween his hands. Such a simple thing, but the children who saw it grew\nwide-eyed, forgetting their fear.\nThe ball of light was bright blue. Part of Navani felt it should be red—to\nreveal the true nature of the spren that hid inside Renarin. A Voidspren. Or\nat least an ordinary spren corrupted to the enemy’s side. None of them knew"

None of them knew\nwhat to do about that fact, least of all Renarin. As with most Radiants, he\nhadn’t known what he was doing when he began. Now that he’d formed the\nbond, it was too late to turn back.\nRenarin claimed the spren was trustworthy, but something was odd about\nhis powers. They had managed to recruit several standard Truthwatchers—\nand they could create illusions like Shallan. Renarin couldn’t do that. He\ncould only summon lights, and they did strange, unnatural things\nsometimes.…\n“So many things could still go wrong!” Falilar said, drawing Navani’s\nattention back to the moment. “What if we underestimated the weight this\nmany people will add? What if the strain cracks gemstones faster than we’d\nplanned? The fans barely worked at all. It’s not a disaster, Brightness, but\nthere’s so much to worry about.”\nHe tugged at his beard again. It was a wonder he had any hairs left at this\npoint.\nNavani patted his arm fondly—if Falilar didn’t have something to worry\nabout, he’d go mad. “Do a visual inspection of the gemstones. Then double-\ncheck your calculations.”\n“Triple-check, you mean?” he said. “Yes, I suppose. Keep myself busy.\nStop worrying.” He reached for his beard, then pointedly shoved his hand in\nthe pocket of his ardent robes.\nNavani passed her checklist to another ardent, then climbed the steps to\nthe top deck. Dalinar said he’d reopen the perpendicularity soon, and she\nwanted to be there—her pencil poised—when he did.\nDown below, the townspeople kept clustering and looking up at the\nstrange battle overhead. All this gawking was really going to throw off the\norderly boarding plan she’d commissioned. Next time she’d have the\nardents draw up a second plan that indicated how long it might take if a\nbattle were occurring.\nWell, at least only the Heavenly Ones were here. They tended to ignore\ncivilians, considering them little more than battlefield obstacles. Other\ngroups of Fused were far more … brutal.\nThe command station was mostly empty now, all of her ardents having\nbeen recruited to comfort and guide the boarding townspeople. Only Rushu\nremained, absently watching the flying Windrunners with her notebook\nopen.\nBother. The pretty young ardent was supposed to be cataloguing the\ntown’s food supplies. Rushu was brilliant, but like a sphere, she tended to\nshine in all directions unless carefully focused.\n“Brightness,” Rushu said as Navani walked up. “Did you see that? The\nFused over there—the one now fighting Highmarshal Kaladin—she let one\nof the Windrunners go after stabbing him.”\n“I’m sure she was merely distracted by Kaladin’s arrival,” Navani said,\nglancing toward Dalinar, who stood directly ahead.\nThe large Horneater bridgeman had taken a position near Dalinar and\nwas looking over some sacks of supplies that Rushu had apparently\nforgotten about.

We have another duty.”\nRushu sighed, but did as asked, tucking her notebook under her arm and\naccompanying Navani. Dalinar stood with his hands clasped behind his\nback, watching the fighting. As Navani had hoped, he relaxed his posture,\nthen brought his hands to the sides—as if gripping some unseen fabric.\nHe pulled his hands together, and the perpendicularity opened as a burst\nof light. Gloryspren, like golden spheres, began to spiral around him.\nNavani got a better glimpse of Shadesmar this time. And again she heard\nthat tone. That was new, wasn’t it? Though she didn’t consider herself\ntalented at drawing—at least not compared to a master like Shallan—she\nsketched what she saw, trying to capture an image of that place with the\nstrange sun over a sea of beads. She could visit it in person if she wished,\nusing the Oathgates—but something felt different about these visions.\n“What did you see?” she asked Rushu.\n“I didn’t see anything, Brightness,” Rushu said. “But … I felt something.\nLike a pulse, a powerful thump. For a moment I felt as if I were falling into\neternity.…”\n“Write that down,” Navani said. “Capture it.”\n“Very well,” Rushu said, opening her notebook again. She glanced up as\nKaladin skimmed the deck overhead, dangerously close, following one of\nthe Fused.\n“Focus, Rushu,” Navani said.\n“If you wish depictions or descriptions of Shadesmar,” Rushu said,\n“Queen Jasnah has released journals of her travels there.”\n“I’m well aware,” Navani said, still drawing. “And I’ve read the\njournals.” The ones Jasnah would give her, anyway. Storming woman.\n“Then why do you need my depiction of it?” Rushu asked.\n“We’re looking for something else,” Navani said, glancing at Dalinar—\nthen shielding her watering eyes. She blinked, then waved for Rushu to\nfollow her to withdraw back to the nearby command post. “There’s\nsomeplace beyond Shadesmar, a place where Dalinar gets this power. Once\nlong ago, the tower was maintained by a Bondsmith like my husband—and\nfrom what the spren have said, I conclude that the tower got its power from\nthat place beyond Shadesmar as well.”\n“You’re still worrying about that, Brightness?” Rushu pursed her lips.\n“It’s not your fault we haven’t decoded the tower’s secrets. It’s a puzzle one\nwoman—or an army of women—can’t be expected to unlock after only a\nyear.”\nNavani winced. Was she truly that transparent? “This is about more than\nthe tower, Rushu,” Navani said. “Everyone is praising the effectiveness of"

Brightlord Kmakl is imagining entire fleets of airships blotting out\nthe sun. Dalinar speaks of moving tens of thousands of troops in an assault\non Kholinar. I don’t think either of them realistically understands how much\nwork goes into keeping this one ship in the air.”\n“Hundreds of laborers in Urithiru turning winches to raise and lower the\nship,” Rushu said, with a nod. “Dozens of chulls used to move it laterally.\nThousands of fabrials to facilitate both—all needing to be perpetually\nreinfused. Careful synchronization via a half dozen spanreeds to coordinate\nmaneuvers. Yes, it is highly improbable we could field more than two or\nthree of these vessels.”\n“Unless,” Navani said, stabbing her finger at her notes, “we discover\nhow the ancients made the tower work. If we knew that secret, Rushu, we\nwould not only be able to restore Urithiru—we might be able to power\nthese airships. We might be able to create fabrials beyond what anyone has\never imagined.”\nRushu cocked her head. “Neat,” she said. “I’ll write down my thoughts.”\n“That’s all? Just … ‘neat’?”\n“I like big ideas, Brightness. Keeps my job from getting boring.” She\nglanced to the side. “But I still think it’s odd how many Windrunners are\nstanding around.”\n“Rushu,” Navani said, rubbing her forehead. “Do try to focus.”\n“Well, I do try. I simply fail. Like that fellow over there? What’s he\ndoing? Not guarding the ship. Not helping with the refugees. Shouldn’t he\nbe fighting?”\n“He’s probably a scout,” Navani said. She followed Rushu’s gaze past\nthe edge of the ship, toward the fertile stone fields. “Obviously he…”\nNavani trailed off as she picked out the man in question standing atop a\nhill—distinctly separated from the battle. Navani could see why Rushu\nwould think him a Windrunner. He wore a uniform after the exact cut of\nBridge Four. In fact, Rushu—who paid attention to the oddest things, but\nnever seemed to notice important details—might have once seen this man in\ntheir ranks. He’d often been at Kaladin’s side during the early months of\nBridge Four’s transition into Dalinar’s army.\nRushu missed the fact that this man’s uniform was black, that he wore no\npatch on his shoulder. That his narrow face and lean figure would mark him\nas a man interdicted. A traitor.\nMoash. The man who had killed Navani’s son.\nHe seemed to meet her eyes, despite the distance. He then burst alight\nwith Stormlight and dropped out of view behind the hill.\nNavani stood there, frozen with shock. Then she gasped, heat washing\nover her as if she’d suddenly stepped into burning sunlight. He was here.\nThat murderer was here!\nShe scrambled over to one of the Windrunner squires on the deck. “Go!”\nshe shouted at him, pointing. “Warn the others. Moash, the traitor, is here!”\n* * *"

Moash, the traitor, is here!”\n* * *\nKaladin again chased Leshwi through a chaotic battlefield. The flight gave\nhim the chance to quickly survey how his soldiers were doing, and what he\nsaw was encouraging.\nMany of them had pushed back their opponents. The bulk of the\nHeavenly Ones were hovering in a wide perimeter, pulling away from\nfights. Kaladin suspected they’d realized there was little to discover by\nlooking at the outside of the ship.\nThe Heavenly Ones, unsupported by ground troops or other Fused,\ndidn’t seem to want to fully commit. Only a few contests continued, and\nKaladin’s was the most furious. Indeed, he had to turn his full attention to\nthe chase, lest he lose Leshwi.\nKaladin found himself grinning as he followed her through a wide loop,\nweaving and dodging around other combatants. When he’d begun training,\nhe’d have thought maneuvers like this turn impossible. To perform the feat,\nhe had to constantly dismiss and renew his Lashings, each at a different\nangle in a loop—doing so without conscious thought—all while sculpting\nhis motion with the rushing wind to avoid obstacles.\nHe could now execute such a maneuver. If not easily, at least regularly. It\nleft him wondering what else Windrunners could do with enough training.\nLeshwi seemed to want to buzz past every other combatant on the\nbattlefield, forcing Kaladin to constantly reorient. A test. She wanted to\npush him, see how good he truly was.\nLet me get close, and I’ll show you how good I am, he thought, cutting\nout of the loop and flying down to intercept her. That put him close enough\nto strike with his spear.\nShe deflected, then darted to the side. He Lashed himself after her, and\nthe two of them shot through the air parallel to the ground, curling around\none another while each tried to get in a hit. The wind was a huge factor,\ntugging at his spear. At these speeds, it was like dueling in a highstorm.\nThey quickly left the town and the main battle. Kaladin had Syl re-form\nas a sword—but Leshwi was prepared for his lunge. She slid her spear\nthrough her hands and gripped it near the head, then dove in and struck at\nhis neck, throwing off his next attack.\nKaladin took a slice on the neck—but not enough for her to siphon away\nhis Stormlight. He pulled away farther, still flying parallel to her, the wind\nmaking his hair whip and twist. He didn’t want to end up isolated, so he\ncurved back toward the main battlefield.\nLeshwi followed. Apparently she’d determined he could keep up with\nher, and now wanted to spar. Their loop took them toward the manor,\ncoming in from the north side.\nThis land was so familiar to Kaladin. He’d played on these hills with\nTien. He first touched a spear—well, a length of wood he pretended was a\nspear—right over there.…\nStay focused, he thought. This is a time for fighting, not reminiscing.\nOnly … this wasn’t some random battlefield off in the Unclaimed Hills."

This is a time for fighting, not reminiscing.\nOnly … this wasn’t some random battlefield off in the Unclaimed Hills.\nFor the first time in his life, he knew the terrain. Better than anyone else in\nthis battle.\nHe smiled, then came in close to Leshwi for a clash, slowing and\nnudging them to the east. He allowed a slice along his arm, then pulled\naway as if in shock. He shot toward the ground, leveling off and darting\namong the hills, Leshwi following.\nThere, he thought. That one.\nHe ducked around the side of a hill, pulling his water flask off his belt.\nHere, on the leeward side of the hill, the rock had been carved away into a\ncavern for storing equipment. And as it had always been when he was\nyoung, the door was slightly ajar and crusted over with the cocoons of\nlurgs: little creatures that spent days hiding inside their coverings, waiting\nfor rain to wake them up.\nKaladin sprayed water from his canteen across the door, then dropped\nthe canteen and ducked around the next hill over, falling still near the\nground. He heard Leshwi come in behind him. She slowed—evidenced by\nthe sound of rustling cloth. She’d have found the discarded canteen.\nKaladin peeked around and spotted her hovering between the hills,\nmaybe two feet off the ground, her long clothing dragging on the stone. She\nslowly turned in a circle, trying to locate him.\nThe lurgs started dropping from their cocoons, thinking rain had come.\nThey began hopping around, causing the door to creak. Leshwi immediately\nspun and leveled her lance toward them.\nKaladin launched toward her. She nearly reacted in time, but this close to\nthe ground her long lance was a hindrance. Leshwi had to twist it around\nand grab it closer to the head before striking, which gave Kaladin the\nchance to ram a newly shortened Sylspear toward her chest.\nHe caught her in the shoulder, making her gasp in pain. She ducked his\nfollow-up slash, but again had trouble maneuvering her lance as he slashed\nher in the leg.\nFor a moment, the struggle was everything. Leshwi dropped her lance\nand pulled a short sword from her belt, then came in closer than Kaladin\nhad expected, knocking aside his spear and trying to grab him by the arm.\nHer greyed flesh healed slowly enough that he was able to ram his shoulder\ninto her wound, making her grunt. When she tried to slide the sword into his\nneck, he deflected it with a Sylbuckler that appeared on his arm.\nLeshwi feinted toward him to make him pull back, then snatched her\nlance and streaked toward the sky. Kaladin followed, his spear materializing\nbefore him—and was on her before she could pick up enough speed to\ndodge. She was forced to defend by sweeping his attacks away, growing\nmore and more reckless. Until Kaladin saw his moment and made the\nSylspear vanish in his hands right as she blocked.\nThen—while Leshwi was reacting to the failed block—he stabbed\nforward, the spear forming as he did so, and slammed it straight into—\nPain."

Her\nweapon hit him in the shoulder, mirroring where he’d struck her opposite\nshoulder. He felt his Stormlight draining away, leeched into the spear; it felt\nas if his very soul was being drawn out. He held on, sucking in all the\nremaining Light from the recharged spheres in his pouches—then forced his\nspear deeper into her wound until tears leaked from the corners of her eyes.\nLeshwi smiled. He grinned back, a full-toothed grin, even while she was\ndraining away his life.\nHe yanked away almost at the same moment she did. She immediately\nput her free hand to her wound, and Kaladin shivered. Frost crackled on his\nuniform as a great deal of Stormlight rushed to fill the wound. That had cost\nhim. He was dangerously low, and Dalinar had taken another break from his\nperpendicularity.\nLeshwi eyed him as they hovered. Then Kaladin heard the screaming.\nHe started, turning toward the sounds. People yelling for help? Yes, the\ncitylord’s manor was on fire—plumes of smoke rising through broken\nwindows. What was going on? Kaladin had been so focused on his duel, he\nhadn’t seen.\nKeeping one eye on Leshwi, he scanned the region. Most of the people\nhad made it to the ship, and the other Windrunners were withdrawing. The\nEdgedancers had already boarded, but there was a small group of people\nstanding in front of the burning manor.\nOne of them stood a good foot or two taller than the others. A hulking\nform of red and black with dangerous carapace and long hair the color of\ndried blood. The Fused from earlier, the one that could become a red line of\nlight. He had gathered the soldiers Kaladin had sent away. Several were\naccosting townspeople, slamming them to the ground, threatening them\nwith weapons and causing them to scream in pain and panic.\nKaladin felt a burning anger. This Fused went after the civilians?\nHe heard an angry-sounding hum beside him. Leshwi had drifted near—\ncloser than he should have let her get—but she didn’t strike. She watched\nthe Fused and his soldiers below, and the sound of her angry humming\nintensified.\nShe looked to him, then nodded toward the Fused and the unfortunate\npeople. He understood the gesture immediately. Go. Stop him.\nKaladin moved forward, then paused and held up his spear before\nLeshwi. Then he dropped it. Though Syl vanished to mist almost\nimmediately, he hoped Leshwi would understand.\nIndeed, she smiled, then—her off hand still pressed to her wound—she\nheld out her own spear and pointed the tip downward. A draw, the gesture\nseemed to say.\nShe nodded again toward the manor. Kaladin needed no further\nencouragement. He shot toward the terrified people.\nThe two metals of primary significance are zinc and brass, which allow\nyou to control expression strength.

She’d heard of this woman’s craftiness, her\ncompetence. Veil was therefore surprised to find the woman looking so …\nweathered.\nIalai Sadeas was a woman of moderate height. While she’d never been\nrenowned as a great beauty, she seemed to have withered since Shallan had\nlast seen her. Though she wore a dress of the sharpest and most recent\nfashion—embroidered along the sides—it seemed to hang on her like a\ncloak on a tavern’s wall peg. Her cheeks were sunken and hollow, and she\nheld an empty wine cup in her hand.\n“So, you’ve finally come for me,” she said.\nVeil hesitated. What did that mean?\nStrike now, Veil thought. Summon the Blade; burn those self-satisfied\neyes out of her skull.\nBut she wouldn’t act on her will alone. They had a balance, an important\none. The Three never did what only one of them wanted, not in regard to a\ndecision this important. And so, she held back. Radiant didn’t want to kill\nIalai. She was too honorable. But what of Shallan?\nNot yet, Shallan thought. Talk to her first. Find out what she knows.\nTherefore, Veil bowed—staying in character. “My queen.”\nIalai snapped her fingers, and the guard retreated with the last of the\ncultists, closing the door behind him. She wasn’t the frightened type, Ialai\nSadeas—though Veil did notice a door on the far wall of the room, behind\nIalai, as a potential exit.\nIalai sat back in her chair, letting Veil hold the bow. “I do not intend to\nbe queen,” she eventually said. “That is a lie that some of my more …\novereager followers perpetuate.”\n“Who then do you support for the throne? Surely not the usurper Dalinar,\nor the niece he has appointed unlawfully.”\nIalai watched Veil, who slowly stood from the bow. “In the past,” Ialai\nsaid, “I have supported the heir—Elhokar’s son, Gavilar’s grandson, the\nrightful king.”\n“He is only a boy, not yet six.”\n“Then urgent action must be taken,” Ialai said, “to rescue him from the\nclutches of his aunt and great-uncle, the rats who have deposed him. To\nsupport me is not to upset the lineage, but to work for a better, stable, and\ncorrect Alethi union.”\nClever. Under such a guise, Ialai could pretend to be a humble patriot."

        "text": "support me is not to upset the lineage, but to work for a better, stable, and\ncorrect Alethi union.”\nClever. Under such a guise, Ialai could pretend to be a humble patriot.\nBut … why did she look so haunted? A wreckage of her former self? She’d\nbeen hit hard by Sadeas’s death and the traitorous turn of Amaram’s army.\nHad those events encouraged a downward spiral? Most importantly, who\nwas the spy this woman had close to Dalinar?\nIalai stood up, letting her wine cup roll off the table and shatter on the\nfloor. She walked past Veil to the nearby hutch and rolled up the front,\nrevealing a dozen or more carafes of wine, each a different color.\nWhile Ialai was surveying these, Veil held her hand to the side and began\nsummoning her Shardblade. Not to strike, but because Pattern was with\nAdolin. The act of summoning should give Pattern an indication of her\ndirection. She stopped almost immediately, preventing the sword from\ncoalescing.\nAdolin would want to come find her. Unfortunately, striking against\nIalai’s fortress would be more dangerous than jumping a group of\nconspirators in the chasm. Dalinar had no authority here, and though the\nLightweaving Shallan had stuck to Adolin would keep him from being\nrecognized, Veil wasn’t certain he could risk moving in the open.\n“Do you favor wines?” Ialai asked her.\n“I’m not particularly thirsty, Brightness,” Veil said.\n“Join me anyway.”\nVeil stepped up beside her, looking at the array of wines. “This is quite a\ncollection.”\n“Yes,” Ialai said, selecting one, a clear—probably a grain alcohol. Left\nuninfused, the color gave no indication of flavoring or potency. “I\nrequisition samples of the vintages that pass through the warcamps. It is one\nof the few luxuries these Heralds-forsaken stormlands can offer.”\nShe poured a small cup, and Veil could immediately tell she’d been\nwrong. It didn’t have the sharp, immediately overpowering sensation of\nsomething like a Horneater vintage. Instead there was a fruity scent mixed\nwith the faint stench of alcohol. Curious.\nIalai offered it to Veil first, who accepted the cup and took a drink. It\ntasted sharply sweet, like a dessert wine. How had they made it clear? Most\nfruit wines had natural coloring.\n“No fear of poison?” Ialai asked.\n“Why should I fear poison, Brightness?”\n“This was prepared for me, and there are many who would see me dead.\nRemaining in my proximity can be dangerous.”\n“Like the attack in the chasm earlier?”\n“It is not the first such strike,” she said, though Veil knew of no others\nthat Dalinar had ordered. “Strange, how easily my enemies strike at me in\nquiet, dark chasms. Yet it has taken them so long to attack me in my\nchambers.” She looked right at Veil.\nDamnation. She knew what Veil had come here to do.\nIalai drank deeply. “What do you think of the wine?”\n“It was nice.”\n“That’s all?” Ialai held up her cup, inspecting the last few drops. “It’s"

It reminds me of visits to\nGavilar’s wineries. I would guess it an Alethi vintage, rescued before the\nkingdom fell, made from simberries. The flesh of the fruit is clear, and they\ntook great care to remove the rinds. Revealing what was truly inside.”\nYes, she did suspect. After a moment of decision, Shallan emerged. If it\nwas to be wordplay, then she should be the one in control.\nIalai selected another carafe, this time a pale orange. “How is it,” she\nsaid, “that you have access to such important documents as Navani’s\nschematics? She can be extremely secretive with her projects—not because\nshe fears someone stealing them, but because she relishes a dramatic\nreveal.”\n“I cannot give away my sources,” Shallan said. “Surely you understand\nthe importance of protecting the identities of those who serve you.” She\npretended to think. “Though I can perhaps share a name, if I were to get one\nin return—someone you have close to the king. A way for both of us to\nhave further access to the Kholin inner circle.”\nA little clumsy, Veil noted. You sure you want control right now?\nIalai smiled, then handed Shallan a small cup of the orange. She took it\n—and found it bland and flavorless.\n“Well?” Ialai asked, sipping her own cup.\n“It is weak,” Shallan said. “Powerless. Yet I taste a hint of something\nwrong. A touch of sourness. An … annoyance that should be exterminated\nfrom the vintage.”\n“And yet,” Ialai said, “it looks so good. A proper orange, to be enjoyed\nby children—and those who act like them. Perfect for people who want to\nmaintain appearances before others. Then the sourness. That’s what this\nvintage truly is, isn’t it? Awful, no matter how it may appear.”\n“To what end?” Shallan asked. “What good does it do to package an\ninferior wine with such a fine label?”\n“It might fool some, for a time,” Ialai said. “Allow the winemaker to\ngain quick and easy ground over his competition. But he’ll eventually be\nrevealed as a fraud, and his creation will be discarded in favor of a truly\nstrong or noble vintage.”\n“You make bold claims,” Shallan said. “One hopes the winemaker\ndoesn’t hear. He might be irate.”\n“Let him be. We both know what he is.”\nAs Ialai moved to serve a third cup, Shallan began to summon her\nShardblade again—giving Pattern another hint to indicate her direction.\nBring it all the way, Veil thought. Strike.\nIs this who we want to be with our powers? Radiant thought. If we start\ndown this path, where will it lead us?\nCould they really serve Dalinar Kholin by acting against his explicit\norders? He didn’t want this. He probably should, but he didn’t.\n“Ah, here,” Ialai said. “Perfect.” She held up a deep blue. This time she"

This time she\ndidn’t offer it to Shallan first, but took a sip. “A wonderful vintage, but the\nlast of its kind. Every other bottle destroyed in a fire. After today, even this\nbit will be gone.”\n“You seem so resigned,” Shallan said. “The Ialai Sadeas I’ve heard about\nwould scour entire kingdoms looking for another bottle of the vintage she\nso loves. Never surrendering.”\n“That Ialai wasn’t nearly so tired,” she said, her hand drooping—as if the\nweight of the cup of wine was somehow too great. “I’ve fought so long.\nAnd now I’m alone … sometimes it seems the very shadows work against\nme.” Ialai selected a carafe of Horneater white—Shallan could smell it as\nsoon as the top was off—and held it out. “I believe this is yours. Invisible.\nDeadly.”\nShallan didn’t take the drink.\n“Get on with it,” Ialai said. “You killed Thanadal when he tried to deal.\nSo I can’t try that. You hunted Vamah and murdered him after he fled, and\nthere’s little chance of me surviving the same. I thought I might be safe if I\nhunkered down for a time. Yet here you are.”\nInvisible. Deadly. Sweet wisdom of Battah …\nShallan had been engaging in this entire conversation assuming that Ialai\nknew her for an operative of Dalinar. That wasn’t the case at all. Ialai saw\nher as an operative of Mraize, of the Ghostbloods.\n“You killed Thanadal,” Shallan said.\nIalai laughed. “He told you that, did he? So they lie to their own?”\nMraize hadn’t specifically told her Ialai had killed Thanadal. But he’d\nclearly implied it.\nVeil gritted her teeth, frustrated. She’d come here of her own volition.\nYes, Mraize was always hinting to her what he and the Ghostbloods wanted.\nBut Veil did not serve him. She had undertaken this mission for … the good\nof Alethkar. And Adolin. And …\n“Go on,” Ialai said. “Do it.”\nVeil thrust her hand to the side, summoning her Shardblade. Ialai\ndropped the carafe of Horneater white, jumping despite herself. Though\nfearspren boiled up from the ground, Ialai merely closed her eyes.\nOh! a perky voice said in Veil’s mind. We were almost here anyway, Veil!\nWhat are we doing?\n“Did they at least tell you why they decided we need to die?” Ialai asked.\n“Why they hated Gavilar? Amaram? Me and Thanadal, once we knew the\nsecrets? What it is about the Sons of Honor that frightens them?”\nVeil hesitated.\nYou found her! Pattern said in her mind. Do you have evidence, like\nDalinar wanted?\n“They’ll send you after Restares next,” Ialai said. “But they’ll watch\nyou. In case you rise high enough, learn enough to threaten them. Have you"

Most of the\nSons of Honor simply wanted their gods back, but Gavilar saw more. He\nsaw entire worlds.…”\n“Tell me more,” Veil said.\nShouts sounded outside the room. Veil glanced at the door in time to see\na brilliant Shardblade slice through the lock. Adolin, wearing the false face\nshe’d given him, kicked open the door a moment later.\nPeople flooded in around him—soldiers and five of Shallan’s\nLightweaver agents.\n“Once I’m dead,” Ialai hissed, “don’t let them search my rooms before\nyou do. Look for the rarest vintage. It is … exotic.”\n“Don’t give me riddles,” the Three said. “Give me answers. What are the\nGhostbloods trying to do?”\nIalai closed her eyes. “Do it.”\nInstead, the Three dismissed her Blade. I vote against killing her, Veil\nthought. Killing her would mean she had been manipulated by Mraize. She\nhated that idea.\n“You’re not dying today,” the Three said. “I have more questions for\nyou.”\nIalai kept her eyes closed. “I won’t get to answer. They won’t let me.”\nShallan emerged, calming her nerves as several soldiers rushed up to\nsurround Ialai. Veil and Radiant settled back, both pleased at this outcome.\nThey were their own person. They did not belong to Mraize.\nShe shook her head and trotted over to Adolin, then dismissed his\nillusory face with a touch. She needed to see him as himself.\n“Which one are you?” he asked quietly, giving her a pouch of infused\nspheres.\n“Shallan,” she said, putting the pouch into her satchel, which a soldier\nhad fetched for her from beside the wall. She glanced over her shoulder as\nthe soldiers bound Ialai, and again Shallan was struck by how deflated the\nwoman looked.\nAdolin pulled Shallan close. “Did she confess to you?”\n“She danced around it,” Shallan said, “but I think I can make a case to\nDalinar that what she said constitutes treason. She wants to depose Jasnah\nand put Elhokar’s son on the throne.”\n“Gavinor is way too young.”\n“And she’d be guiding him,” Shallan said. “Which is why she’s a traitor\n—she wants the power.”\nBut … Ialai had spoken like that plan was in the past, as if she were now\nfighting only for survival. Had the Ghostbloods truly killed Highprinces\nThanadal and Vamah?\n“Well,” Adolin said, “with her in custody, perhaps we can get her armies\nto stand down.

She’d been with Shallan for over a year\nnow, and—along with Vathah, leader of the deserters that Shallan had\nrecruited—was one of those she trusted most.\n“Yeah, Brightness?” Ishnah asked.\n“Take Vathah and Beryl. Go with those soldiers and make certain they\ndon’t let Ialai speak to anyone. Gag her if you have to. She has a way of\ngetting inside people’s heads.”\n“Consider it done,” Ishnah said. “You want to put the illusion on her\nfirst?”\nThe contingency plan for extraction was simple: They’d use\nLightweaving to make themselves into House Sadeas guards, and Ialai into\nsomeone lowborn. They’d march her out the gates with ease, capturing the\nhighprincess right out from underneath the watchful eyes of her guards.\n“Yes,” Shallan said, waving the soldiers to bring the woman over. Ialai\nwalked with her eyes closed, still maintaining her fatalistic air. Shallan took\nIalai by the arm, then breathed out and let the Lightweaving surround her,\nchanging the woman to look like one of the sketches Shallan had done\nrecently—a kitchen woman with rosy cheeks and a wide smile.\nIalai didn’t deserve such a kindly face, nor did she deserve such a light\ntreatment. Shallan felt an unexpected spike of disgust at touching Ialai; this\ncreature and her husband had plotted and executed a terrible plan to betray\nDalinar. Even after the move to Urithiru, Ialai had worked to undermine\nhim at every opportunity. If this woman had gotten her way, Adolin would\nhave died before Shallan met him. And now they were just going to take her\nin to play more games?\nShallan let go, hand going to her satchel. Radiant was the one who\nemerged, however. She grabbed Ialai by her arm and towed her over to\nAdolin’s soldiers, handing her off.\n“Take her out with the others,” Adolin said.\n“You got the rest of the conspirators?” Shallan asked, walking back to\nhim.\n“They tried to escape out the side door as we burst in, but I think we\nmanaged to round them all up.”\nIshnah and the soldiers—Adolin’s men, hand-picked from among his\nfinest—led the disguised and bound Ialai out the door. The highprincess\nsagged in their grip.\nAdolin watched her go, a frown on his lips.\n“You’re thinking,” Shallan said, “that we shouldn’t have ever let her\nleave Urithiru. That it’d be easier if we’d ended her, and the threat she\nrepresented, before it went this far.”\n“I’m thinking,” Adolin said, “that maybe we don’t want to travel that\nroad.”\n“Maybe we started already. Back when you…”\nAdolin drew his lips to a line. “I don’t have any answers right now,” he\neventually said. “I don’t know if I ever did. But we should ransack this\nplace quickly. Father might want more proof than your word, and it would"

Father might want more proof than your word, and it would\nbe awfully helpful if we could present him with incriminating journals or\nletters.”\nShallan nodded, waving over Gaz and Red. She would have them search\nthe place.\nAnd what of what Ialai had said? Look for the rarest vintage.… Shallan\neyed the wines set out on the counter of the hutch. Why speak in riddles?\nAdolin and the others were coming in, Shallan thought. She didn’t want\nthem to understand. Storms, the woman had grown paranoid. But why trust\nShallan?\nI won’t get to answer. They won’t let me.…\n“Adolin,” she said. “Something is wrong with this. With Ialai, with me\nbeing here, with—”\nShe cut herself off as shouts sounded in the antechamber. Shallan\nscrambled out, feeling a sense of dread. She found Ialai Sadeas lying on the\nfloor, foam coming from the mouth of her fake face. The soldiers watched\nwith horror.\nThe highprincess stared up with lifeless eyes. Dead.\n* * *\nKaladin flew through the smoke billowing up over the manor. He soared\ndown toward where the townspeople were being threatened by the strange\nFused and his soldiers. That was Waber, the manor’s gardener, being held\nagainst the ground with a boot to his face.\nThis is obviously a trap, Syl said in Kaladin’s mind. That Fused knows\nexactly what to do in order to draw the attention of a Windrunner: attack\ninnocents.\nShe was right. Kaladin forced himself to drop carefully a short distance\naway. The Fused had torn a hole in the wall around a side entrance of the\nmanor. Though flames licked the upper floors of the structure, the room\nbeyond the hole was dark, not yet afire. At least not completely.\nAs soon as Kaladin landed, the singers released Waber and the others,\nthen retreated through the broken hole in the stone wall. Five soldiers,\nKaladin noted. Three with swords, two with spears.\nThe Fused carried one captive as he strode into the building; thin, with a\ngaunt face, the captive was bleeding from a slash along his stomach.\nGodeke the Edgedancer. His Stormlight had apparently run out. Storms\nsend he was still alive. The Fused wanted to use him as bait, so the chances\nseemed good.\nKaladin strode toward the broken wall. “You want to fight me, Fused?\nCome on. Let’s have at it.”\nThe creature, shadowed inside the building, growled something in his\nown rhythmic language. One of the soldiers translated. “I will fight you\ninside where you cannot fly away, little Windrunner. Come, face me.”\nI don’t like this, Syl said.\n“Agreed,” Kaladin whispered. “Be ready to go get help.”\nHe Lashed himself upward slightly, enough to make him lighter on his\nfeet, then inched into the burning building.

Flamespren danced along the wood with a\nfrantic delight.\nThe hulking Fused stood directly ahead, two soldiers at each side. They\nmoved forward to flank Kaladin. Where was the fifth soldier? There, near\nan overturned table, fiddling with something that glowed a deep violet-\nblack. Voidlight? Wait … was that a fabrial? The light dimmed suddenly.\nKaladin’s powers vanished.\nHe felt it as a strange smothering sensation, as if something heavy had\nbeen placed on top of his mind. His full weight came upon him again, his\nLashing canceled.\nSyl gasped and her spear puffed away as she became a spren—and when\nKaladin tried to resummon his Blade, nothing happened.\nImmediately, Kaladin stepped backward to try to escape the range of the\nstrange fabrial. But the soldiers quickly rushed to surround him, cutting off\nhis retreat. Kaladin’s assumption that he could beat them easily had relied\non his Shardspear and his powers.\nStorms! Kaladin strained to create a Lashing. Stormlight still raged\ninside him, and kept him from needing to breathe the acrid smoke, but\nsomething was suppressing his other abilities.\nThe Fused laughed and spoke in Alethi. “Radiants! You rely too much on\nyour powers. Without them, what are you? A peasant child with no real\ntraining in the art of warfare or—”\nKaladin slammed himself against the soldier to his right.\nThe sudden motion caused the singer to cry out and fall backward.\nKaladin yanked the spear from the man’s hand, then—in a fluid motion—\nwhipped it into a two-handed lunge, impaling a second soldier.\nThe two soldiers on his left recovered and leaped for him. Kaladin felt\nthe wind encircle him as he spun between the two of them, catching one\nsword—aimed low—with the butt of his spear as he caught the second one\n—aimed high—right behind the spear’s head. Metal met wood with a\nfamiliar thunk, and Kaladin finished his spin, throwing off both weapons.\nHe gutted one man, then tripped him—sending him stumbling to the\nground in front of his ally. These soldiers were trained well, but hadn’t seen\nmuch actual combat yet—as evidenced by how the remaining singer froze\nwhen he saw his friends dying.\nKaladin kept moving, almost without thought, spearing the fourth soldier\nin the neck. There, Kaladin thought as the expected ribbon of red light came\ndarting toward him. He will go for my back again.\nKaladin dropped his spear, pulled a throwing knife off his belt, and\nturned. He rammed the knife into the air right before the Fused appeared—\nslamming the small blade into the creature’s neck, angled between two\npieces of carapace.\nThe Fused let out an urk of shock and pain, his eyes wide.\nFire made wood snap overhead, and burning cinders dropped down as\nthe enormous Fused toppled forward like a felled tree, the floorboards\nshaking with the impact. Blessedly, no red ribbon of light rose from him\nthis time."

Blessedly, no red ribbon of light rose from him\nthis time.\n“That’s a relief,” Syl said, landing on Kaladin’s shoulder. “I guess if you\ncatch him before he teleports, you really can kill him.”\n“At least until the Everstorm rebirths him,” Kaladin said, checking the\nsingers he’d killed. Other than the one dying slowly from the gut wound,\nhe’d left only two alive—the one he’d shoved, and the fifth one, across the\nroom, who had activated the fabrial.\nThe former had scrambled out the gaping hole in the wall to escape. The\nlatter had left the fabrial and was inching to the side, his sword out, eyes\nwide.\nThe man was trying to reach Godeke—perhaps to use him as a hostage.\nIn the fray, the wounded Edgedancer had fallen to the ground beside the\nhusk after the Fused had teleported to Kaladin. Godeke was now moving—\nbut not under his own power. A small, gangly figure had the Edgedancer by\none leg and was slowly dragging him away from the fight. Kaladin hadn’t\nseen Lift sneak into the room—but then again, she often showed up where\none did not expect her.\n“Take him out the hole, Lift,” Kaladin said, stepping toward the last\nsinger. “Are your powers suppressed too?”\n“Yeah,” she said. “What’d they do to us?”\n“I’m extremely curious about this too,” Syl said, zipping over to the\ndevice on the floor, a gemstone covered in metal pieces and resting on\ntripod legs. “That is a very strange fabrial.”\nKaladin pointed his spear at the last singer, who—hesitantly—dropped\nhis sword and raised his hands. He had a jagged skin pattern of red and\nblack.\n“What is that fabrial?” Kaladin asked.\n“I … I…” The soldier swallowed. “I don’t know. I was told to twist the\ngemstone at the base to activate it.”\n“That’s Voidlight powering it,” Syl said. “I’ve never seen anything like\nit.”\nKaladin glanced at the smoke pooling on the ceiling. “Lift?” he said.\n“On it,” she said, scrambling over to the device while Kaladin kept the\nsoldier guarded. A moment later, Kaladin’s powers returned. He sighed in\nrelief, though that made Stormlight puff before him. Nearby, Godeke\ngasped, unconsciously breathing in Stormlight, and his wound started to\nheal.\nStrengthened by the Light, Kaladin grabbed the soldier and lifted him\nup, infusing him enough to make him hang in the air. “I told you to leave\nthe city,” Kaladin growled softly. “I’m memorizing your face, your pattern,\nyour stench. If I see you again, ever, I will send you hurtling upward with\nso much Stormlight that you will have a long, long time to think during the\nfall back down. Understood?”\nThe singer nodded, humming a conciliatory sound. Kaladin shoved him,\nrecovering his Stormlight and making the man fall to the ground. He\nscrambled away out the hole."

He\nscrambled away out the hole.\n“There was another human in here,” Lift said. “An old lighteyed man in\nbeggar’s clothing. I was watching from outside the building, and saw the\nman come in here with Godeke. A short time later, that Fused broke through\nthe wall, carrying Godeke—but I didn’t spot the other man.”\nRoshone. The former citylord had told Dalinar he was going to search\nthe manor’s stormcellar to free imprisoned townspeople. Though he wasn’t\nproud of it, Kaladin hesitated—but when Syl looked at him, he gritted his\nteeth and nodded.\nSo long as it is right … he thought.\n“I’ll find him,” Kaladin said. “Make sure Godeke recovers, then get that\nfabrial to Brightness Navani. She’s going to find it very interesting.”\n* * *\nShallan removed the illusion, revealing Ialai’s face, spittle dripping from\nher lips. One of Adolin’s men checked her pulse, confirming it.\nShe was dead.\n“Damnation!” Adolin said, standing helpless above the body. “What\nhappened?”\nWe didn’t do this, Veil thought. We decided not to kill her, right?\nI … Shallan’s mind began to fuzz, everything feeling blurry. Had she\ndone this? She’d wanted to. But she hadn’t, had she? She was … was more\nin control than that.\nI didn’t do it, Shallan thought. She was reasonably certain.\nSo what happened? Radiant asked.\n“She must have taken poison,” said Vathah, leaning down. “Blackbane.”\nEven after many months as Shallan’s squire and then agent, the former\ndeserter didn’t look like he belonged with Adolin’s soldiers. Vathah was too\nrough. Not sloppy, but unlike Adolin’s men, he didn’t care much for the spit\nand polish. He showed his disdain by leaving his jacket undone, his hair\nmessy.\n“I’ve seen someone die like that before, Brightness,” he explained.\n“Back in Sadeas’s army, an officer was smuggling and selling supplies.\nWhen he finally got found out, he poisoned himself rather than be taken.”\n“I didn’t see her do it,” Ishnah said, sheepish. “I’m sorry.”\n“Nale’s nuts,” muttered one of Adolin’s soldiers. “This is going to look\nbad, isn’t it? This is exactly what the Blackthorn didn’t want. Another\nSadeas corpse on our hands.”\nAdolin drew in a long deep breath. “We have enough evidence to have\nseen her hanged; my father will simply have to accept that. We’ll bring\ntroops to the warcamps to make certain her soldiers don’t get rowdy.\nStorms. This mess should have been cleaned up months ago.”\nHe pointed at several soldiers. “Check the other conspirators for poison,\nand gag them all. Shallan will disguise the body like a rug or something so\nwe can get it out. Gen and Natem, search Ialai’s things in the next room to\nsee if you can find any useful evidence.”"

I know what to watch\nfor, and your soldiers don’t. You handle the captives and search the rest of\nthe building.”\n“Good idea,” Adolin said. He rubbed his brow, but then—perhaps seeing\nthe little anxietyspren that appeared near her, like a twisting black cross—\nsmiled. “Don’t worry. Every mission has a few hitches.”\nShe nodded, more to put him at ease than to indicate her real feelings. As\nthe soldiers moved to follow his orders, she knelt by Ialai’s body.\nIshnah joined her. “Brightness? Do you need something?”\n“She didn’t eat poison, did she?” Shallan asked softly.\n“Can’t be certain,” Ishnah said. “I know a little about blackbane\nthough.…” She blushed. “Well, I know a lot. My gang would use it on\nrivals. It’s tough to make, because you need to dry the leaves out, then make\na gum out of them to get it to full potency. Anyway, eating it isn’t the best.\nIf you can get it into the blood though, it kills quickly.…” She trailed off,\nfrowning—perhaps realizing as Shallan had that Ialai had died very quickly.\nShallan knew of blackbane herself. She’d studied up on poisons recently.\nWould I be able to spot a pinprick? Shallan thought, kneeling beside the\ncorpse.\nEither way, she suspected Ialai had been right: The Ghostbloods hadn’t\ntrusted Shallan to kill her, and they’d sent a second knife to see the job\ndone. That would mean they had an operative among Adolin’s guards or\nShallan’s own agents. The idea made Shallan’s stomach twist.\nAnd this person was separate from the spy Ialai supposedly had among\nDalinar’s elite? Storms. It was tying Shallan’s mind in knots. “Look the\nbody over,” Shallan whispered to Ishnah. “See if you can find evidence if\nthis was self-inflicted, or if someone else killed her.”\n“Yes, Brightness.”\nShallan quickly walked back into the room with the wine hutch. Gaz and\nRed were already working to gather Ialai’s things. Storms, could she trust\nthese two?\nIn any case, Ialai’s prediction had proven correct. And it was possible\nthat this room held secrets Mraize didn’t want Shallan to find.\nA bronze cage can create a warning fabrial, alerting one to objects or\nentities nearby.

There was little worse than having your weapon fail you in\nbattle.\n“We’re going to have to watch for those fabrials,” Kaladin said. “I don’t\nlike the idea of our powers being subject to removal by the enemy.” He\nglanced at Syl, who sat on his shoulder. “Have you experienced anything\nlike that before?”\nShe shook her head. “Not that I remember. It made me feel … faded. As\nif I wasn’t quite here.”\nHe shied away from rooms consumed by the blaze, full of primal\nshadows and lights, bright orange and red, deep and angry colors. If the\ncitylords had been content with a normal house, this could never have\nhappened. But no, they needed to be set apart, own a home full of delicate\nwood instead of sturdy stone. The hungry flames seemed excited as they\nplayed with the dying manor. There was a glee to the sounds of the fire: its\nroars and hisses. Flamespren ran up the wall alongside him, leaving tracks\nof black on the wood.\nAhead, the kitchen was fully engulfed. He didn’t mind the heat so far—\nhis Stormlight healed burns before they had a chance to more than itch. As\nlong as he stayed away from the heart of the fire, he should be all right.\nUnfortunately, that might prove impossible.\n“Where’s the cellar?” Syl asked from his shoulder.\nKaladin pointed through the kitchen inferno toward a doorway—barely\nvisible as a shadow.\n“Great,” Syl said. “You going to run for it?”\nKaladin nodded, not daring to lose his Stormlight by speaking. He\nbraced himself, then dashed into the room, flames and smoke curling\naround him. A forlorn groaning sound from above indicated that the ceiling\nwas close to giving in.\nA quick Lashing upward let Kaladin leap the burning kitchen counter. He\nlanded on the other side and slammed his shoulder into the charred door to\nthe cellar, breaking through with a loud crash, bits of flame and soot\nspraying before him.\nHe entered a dark tunnel sloping downward, cut directly into the rock of\nthe hillside. As he moved away from the inferno behind, Syl giggled.\n“What?” he asked.\n“Your backside’s on fire,” she said.\nDamnation. He batted at the back of his coat. Well, after getting stabbed\nby Leshwi, this uniform was ruined anyway. He was going to have to listen\nto Leyten complain about how often Kaladin went through them. The\nWindrunner quartermaster seemed convinced that Kaladin let himself get\nhit solely to make it difficult to keep uniforms in supply.\nHe started through the dark stone tunnel, counting on his Stormlight to\nprovide illumination. Soon after entering, he crossed a metal grate covering\na deep pit: the watercatch, to divert rainwater that flooded the tunnel. A\nstormcellar like this was where lighteyed families retreated during\nhighstorms.\nHe’d have dismissed potential flooding as another problem with living in\na wooden home, but even stone houses occasionally got damaged during\nstorms.

He didn’t blame anyone for wanting to put several feet of rock\nbetween them and the raging winds. He had played down here with Laral as\na child, and it seemed smaller to him now. He remembered a deep, endless\ntunnel. But soon after he passed the watercatch, he saw the lit cellar room\nahead.\nAs Kaladin stepped into the underground room, he found two prisoners\nmanacled to the far wall, slumped in place, their heads bowed. He didn’t\nrecognize one of them—perhaps he was a refugee—but the other was Jeber,\nfather to a couple of the boys Kaladin had known as a youth.\n“Jeber,” Kaladin said, hurrying forward. “Have you seen Roshone?\nHe…”\nKaladin trailed off as he noticed that neither person was moving. He\nknelt, feeling a growing dread as he got a better glimpse of Jeber’s lean\nface. It was perfectly normal, save for the pale cast—and the two burned-\nout pits, like charcoal, in place of the eyes. He’d been killed with a\nShardblade.\n“Kaladin!” Syl said. “Behind you!”\nHe spun, thrusting out his hand and summoning his Blade. The rough-\nhewn room sloped back to the left of the doorway, making a small alcove\nthat Kaladin hadn’t been able to see when first entering. There, standing\nquietly, was a tall man with a hawkish face, brown hair flecked with black.\nMoash wore a sharp black uniform cut after the Alethi style, and held\nBrightlord Roshone in front of him with a knife to the man’s neck. The\nformer citylord was crying silently, Moash’s other hand covering his mouth,\nfearspren undulating on the ground.\nMoash jerked the knife in a quick, efficient slice, opening Roshone’s\nthroat and spilling his lifeblood across the front of his ragged clothing.\nRoshone fell to the stone. Kaladin shouted, scrambling to help, but the\nsurgeon within him shook his head. A slit throat? That wasn’t the kind of\nwound a surgeon could heal.\nMove on to someone you can help, his father seemed to say. This one is\ndead.\nStorms! Was it too late to fetch Lift or Godeke? They could … They\ncould …\nRoshone thrashed weakly on the ground before a helpless Kaladin. Then\nthe man who had terrorized Kaladin’s family—the man who had consigned\nTien to death—simply … faded away in a pool of his own blood.\nKaladin glared up at Moash, who silently returned his knife to its belt\nsheath. “You came to save him, didn’t you, Kal?” Moash asked. “One of\nyour worst enemies? Instead of finding vengeance and peace, you run to\nrescue him.”\nKaladin roared, leaping to his feet. Roshone’s death sent Kaladin back to\nthat moment in the palace at Kholinar. A spear through Elhokar’s chest. And\nMoash … giving a Bridge Four salute as if he in any way deserved to claim\nthat privilege."

Confronting difficult things was a problem for her, but part of\nfinding her balance—three personas, each of them distinctly useful—had\ncome when she’d accepted her pain. Even if she didn’t deserve it.\nThe balance was working. She was functioning.\nBut are we getting better? Veil asked. Or merely hovering in place?\nI’ll accept not getting worse, Shallan thought.\nFor how long? Veil asked. A year now of standing in the wind, not\nsliding backward, but not progressing. You need to start remembering\neventually. The difficult things …\nNo. Not that. Not yet. She had work to do. She turned away from the\nbody, focusing on the problems at hand. Did the Ghostbloods have spies\namong Shallan’s inner circle? She found the idea not only plausible, but\nlikely.\nAdolin might be willing to call today’s mission a success, and Shallan\ncould accept that successfully infiltrating the Sons of Honor had at least\nproven that she could plan and execute a mission. But she couldn’t help\nfeeling she’d been played by Mraize, despite Veil’s best efforts.\n“Nothing in here except some empty wine bottles,” Red said, opening\ndrawers and cabinets on the hutch. “Wait! I think I found Gaz’s sense of\nhumor.” He held up something small between two fingers. “Nope. Just a\nwithered old piece of fruit.”\nGaz had found a small bedchamber at the rear of the room, through the\ndoor that Veil had noticed. “If you do find my sense of humor, kill it,” he\ncalled from inside. “That will be more merciful than forcing it to deal with\nyour jokes, Red.”\n“Brightness Shallan thinks they’re funny. Right?”\n“Anything that annoys Gaz is funny, Red,” she said.\n“Well, I annoy myself!” Gaz called. He stuck out his head, fully bearded,\nnow with two working eyes—having regrown the missing one after he’d\nfinally learned to draw in Stormlight a few months ago. “So I must be the\nmost hilarious storming man on the planet. What are we searching for,\nShallan?”\n“Papers, documents, notebooks,” she said. “Letters. Any kind of\nwriting.”\nThe two continued their inspection.

How had Veil missed the fine scrollwork paint near the ceiling, ringing\nthe room? And the rug in the center might have been monochrome, but it\nwas thick and well maintained. She kicked off her shoes and stockings and\nwalked across it, feeling the luxurious threads under her toes. The room was\nunderstated, yes, but not bleak.\nSecrets. Where were the secrets? Pattern hummed on her skirt as she\nstepped over to the hutch and inspected the wines. Ialai had mentioned a\nrare vintage. These wines were the clue.\nNothing to do but try them. Shallan had suffered far worse tests in the\ncourse of her duties. Red gave her a cocked eyebrow as she began pouring\nand tasting a little of each.\nDespite Ialai’s lengthy rumination on the wines, most of them tasted\ndistinctly ordinary to Shallan. She wasn’t an expert though; she favored\nanything that tasted good and got her drunk.\nThinking of that, she took in a little Stormlight and burned away the\neffects of the alcohol. Now wasn’t the time for a muddy head. Though most\nof the wines were ordinary, she did land on one she couldn’t place. It was a\nsweet wine, deep red, bloody in color. It didn’t taste like anything she’d had\nbefore. Fruity, yet robust, and perhaps a little bit … heavy. Was that the\nright word?\n“I’ve got some letters here,” Gaz said from the bedroom. “There are also\nsome books that seem like she handwrote them.”\n“Gather it all,” Shallan said. “We’ll sort it out later. I need to go ask\nAdolin something.”\nShe carried the carafe out to him. Several guards watched the door, and it\ndidn’t seem anyone in the warcamp had noticed the attack. At least, no one\nhad come knocking.\nShallan pointedly ignored—then forced herself to look at—the body\nagain. Adolin stepped over to meet her, speaking softly. “We should get\ngoing. A couple of the guards escaped. We might want to write for some\nWindrunners to meet us for quicker extraction. And … what happened to\nyour shoes?”\nShallan glanced at her bare feet, which poked out from under her dress.\n“They were impeding my ability to think.”\n“Your…” Adolin ran a hand through his delightfully messy hair, blond\nspeckled with black. “Love, you’re deliciously weird sometimes.”\n“The rest of the time, I’m just tastelessly weird.” She held up the carafe.\n“Drink. It’s for science.”\nHe frowned, but tried a sip, then grimaced.\n“What is it?” she asked.\n“Shin ‘wine.’ They have no idea how to ferment a proper alcohol. They\nmake it all out of the same strange little berry.”\n“Exotic indeed…” Shallan said. “We can’t leave quite yet.

Red had joined Gaz in the extremely tiny bedchamber. There\nwere no windows, with barely enough room to stand. It held a mattress with\nno frame and a trunk that apparently stored the notes and letters Gaz had\ngathered.\nIalai would expect those to be found. There might be secrets in them, but\nnot what Shallan hunted. Ialai moved here after her palace burned down.\nShe slept in a closet and refused to leave this fortress. And still Mraize got\nnot one, but two people in to kill her.\nShin wine. Was that the clue? Something about the hutch? She glanced it\nover, then got out her sketchpad.\n“Pattern,” she said, “search the room for patterns.”\nPattern hummed and moved off her skirt—rippling the floor as he moved\nacross it, as if he were somehow inside the stone, making the surface bulge.\nAs he began searching, she did a sketch of the hutch.\nThere was something about committing an object to memory, then\nfreezing it into a drawing, that let her see better. She could judge the spaces\nbetween the drawers, the thickness of the wood—and she soon knew there\nwas no room in the hutch for hidden compartments.\nShe shooed away a couple of creationspren, then stood. Patterns,\npatterns, patterns. She scanned the carpet, then the painted designs on the\nupper trim of the room. Shinovar. Was the Shin wine truly important, or had\nshe mistaken the clue?\n“Shallan,” Pattern said from across the room. “A pattern.”\nShallan hurried to where he dimpled the rock of the wall, near the far\nnorthwest corner. Kneeling, she found that the stones did have a faint\npattern to them. Carvings that—worn by time—she could barely feel\nbeneath her fingers.\n“This building,” she said, “it’s not new. At least part of it was already\nstanding when the Alethi arrived at the warcamps. They built the structure\non an already-set foundation. What are the markings? I can barely make\nthem out.”\n“Mmm. Ten items in a pattern, repeating,” he said.\nThis one feels a little like a glyph.… she thought. These warcamps dated\nback to the shadowdays, when the Epoch Kingdoms had stood. Ten\nkingdoms of humankind. Ten glyphs? She wasn’t certain she could interpret\nancient glyphs—even Jasnah might have had trouble with that—but maybe\nshe didn’t have to.\n“These stones run around the base of the wall,” Shallan said. “Let’s see\nif any of the other carvings are easier to make out.”\nA few of the stones were indeed better preserved. They each bore a\nglyph—and what appeared to be a small map in the shape of one of the old\nkingdoms. Most were indistinct blobs, but the crescent shape of Shinovar’s\nmountains stood out.\nShin wine. A map with the Shinovar mountains. “Find every block with"

A map with the Shinovar mountains. “Find every block with\nthis shape on it,” she told Pattern.\nHe did so, every tenth block. She moved along to each one until, on the\nthird try, the stone wiggled. “Here,” she said. “In the corner. I think this is\nright.”\n“Mmm…” he said. “A few degrees off, so technically acute.”\nShe carefully slid the stone out. Inside, like the mythical gemstone cache\nfrom a bedtime tale, she found a small notebook. She glanced up and\nchecked whether Gaz and Red were still in the other room. They were.\nDamnation, she has me distrusting my own agents, Shallan thought,\nslipping the notebook into her safepouch and replacing the stone. Maybe\nIalai’s only plan had been to sow chaos, distrust. But … Shallan couldn’t\nentirely accept that theory, not with how haunted Ialai had seemed. It wasn’t\nhard to believe the Ghostbloods had been hunting her; Mraize had\ninfiltrated Amaram and Ialai’s inner circle a year ago, but hadn’t gone with\nthem when they’d fled Urithiru.\nThough Shallan itched to peek through the notebook, Gaz and Red\nemerged with a pillowcase full of notes and letters. “If there’s anything\nmore in there,” Gaz said, thumbing over his shoulder, “we can’t find it.”\n“It will have to do,” Shallan said as Adolin waved her to join him. “Let’s\nget out of here.”\n* * *\nKaladin hesitated, spear held toward Moash’s throat. He could end the man.\nShould end the man. Why did he hesitate?\nMoash … had been his friend. They’d spent hours by the fire, talking\nabout their lives. Kaladin had opened his heart to this man, in ways he\nhadn’t to most of the others. He’d told Moash, like Teft and Rock, of Tien.\nOf Roshone. Of his fears.\nMoash wasn’t just a friend though. He was beyond that a member of\nBridge Four. Kaladin had sworn to the storms and the heavens above—if\nanyone was there watching—that he’d protect those men.\nKaladin had failed Moash. As soundly as he’d failed Dunny, Mart, and\nJaks. And of them all, losing Moash hurt the most. Because in those callous\neyes, Kaladin saw himself.\n“You bastard,” Kaladin hissed.\n“You deny that I was justified?” Moash kicked at Roshone’s body. “You\nknow what he did. You know what he cost me.”\n“You killed Elhokar for that crime!”\n“Because he deserved it, like this one did.” Moash shook his head. “I did\nthis for you too, Kal. You would let your brother’s soul cry into the storms,\nunavenged?”\n“Don’t you dare speak of Tien!” Kaladin shouted. He felt himself\nslipping, losing control. It happened whenever he thought of Moash, of\nKing Elhokar dying, of failing the people of Kholinar and the men of the\nWall Guard."

You killed them\nfor justice?”\n“For mercy,” Moash said. “Better a quick death than to leave them to\ndie, forgotten.”\n“You could have set them free!” Kaladin’s hands were sweaty on his\nweapon, and his mind … his mind wouldn’t think straight. His Stormlight\nwas running low, almost out.\nKaladin, Syl said. Let’s leave.\n“We have to deal with him,” Kaladin whispered. “I have to … have\nto…”\nWhat? Kill Moash while he stood defenseless? This was a man Kaladin\nwas supposed to protect. To save …\n“They’re going to die, you know,” Moash said softly.\n“Shut up.”\n“Everyone you love, everyone you think you can protect. They’re all\ngoing to die anyway. There’s nothing you can do about it.”\n“I said shut up!” Kaladin shouted.\nMoash stepped toward the spear, dropping his hands to his sides as he\ntook a second step.\nKaladin, strangely, felt himself shying away. He’d been so tired lately,\nand while he tried to ignore it—tried to keep going—his fatigue seemed a\nsudden weight. Kaladin had used a lot of his Stormlight fighting, then\ngetting through the fire.\nIt ran out right then, and he deflated. The numbness he’d been shoving\ndown this entire battle flooded into him. The exhaustion.\nBeyond Moash, the distant fire crackled and snapped. Far off, a loud\ncrashing crunch echoed through the tunnel: the kitchen ceiling finally\ncollapsing. Bits of burning wood tumbled down the tunnel, the embers\nfading to darkness.\n“Do you remember the chasm, Kal?” Moash whispered. “In the rain that\nnight? Standing there, looking down into the darkness, and knowing it was\nyour sole release? You knew it then. You try to pretend you’ve forgotten.\nBut you know. As sure as the storms will come. As sure as every lighteyes\nwill lie. There is only one answer. One path. One result.”\n“No…” Kaladin whispered.\n“I’ve found the better way,” Moash said. “I feel no guilt. I’ve given it\naway, and in so doing became the person I could always have become—if I\nhadn’t been restrained.”\n“You’ve become a monster.”\n“I can take away the pain, Kal. Isn’t that what you want? An end to your\nsuffering?”\nKaladin felt like he was in a trance. Frozen, as he’d been when he\nwatched … watched Elhokar die. A disconnect that had festered inside him\never since.\nNo, it had been growing for longer. A seed that made him incapable of\nfighting, of deciding—paralyzing him while his friends died.\nHis spear slipped from his fingers. Syl was talking, but … but he\ncouldn’t hear her. Her voice was a distant breeze.…\n“There’s a simple path to freedom,” Moash said, reaching out and\nputting his hand on Kaladin’s shoulder. A comforting, familiar gesture."

You’ve always known it, haven’t\nyou?”\nKaladin blinked away tears, and the deepest part of him—the little boy\nwho hated the rain and the darkness—withdrew into his soul and curled up.\nBecause … he did want to stop hurting.\nHe wanted it so badly.\n“I need one thing from you,” Moash said. “I need you to admit that I’m\nright. I need you to see. As they keep dying, remember. As you fail them,\nand the pain consumes you, remember there is a way out. Step back up to\nthat cliff and jump into the darkness.”\nSyl was screaming, but it was only wind. A distant wind …\n“But I won’t fight you, Kal,” Moash whispered. “There is no fight to be\nwon. We lost the moment we were born into this cursed life of suffering.\nThe sole victory left to us is to choose to end it. I found my way. There is\none open to you.”\nOh, Stormfather, Kaladin thought. Oh, Almighty.\nI just … I just want to stop failing the people I love.…\nLight exploded into the room.\nClean and white, like the light of the brightest diamond. The light of the\nsun. A brilliant, concentrated purity.\nMoash growled, spinning around, shading his eyes against the source of\nthe light—which came from the doorway. The figure behind it wasn’t\nvisible as anything more than a shadow.\nMoash shied away from the light—but a version of him, transparent and\nfilmy, broke off and stepped toward the light instead. Like an afterimage. In\nit, Kaladin saw the same Moash—but somehow standing taller, wearing a\nbrilliant blue uniform. This one raised a hand, confident, and although\nKaladin couldn’t see them, he knew people gathered behind this Moash.\nProtected. Safe.\nThe image of Moash burst alight as a Shardspear formed in his hands.\n“No!” the real Moash screamed. “No! Take it! Take my pain!” He\nstumbled away to the side of the room, furious, a Shardblade—the Blade of\nthe Assassin in White—forming in his hands. He swung at the empty air.\nFinally he lowered his head—shadowing his face with his elbow—and\nshoved past the figure in the light and rushed back up the tunnel.\nKaladin knelt, bathed in that warm light. Yes, warmth. Kaladin felt\nwarm. Surely … if there truly was a deity … it watched him from within\nthat light.\nThe light faded, and a spindly young man with black and blond hair\nrushed forward to grab Kaladin.\n“Sir!” Renarin asked. “Kaladin, sir? Are you all right? Are you out of\nStormlight?”\n“I…” Kaladin shook his head. “What…”\n“Come on,” Renarin said, getting under his arm to help lift him. “The\nFused have retreated.

He stood near the railing, watching\nHearthstone—now abandoned—shrinking beneath them. From this\ndistance, the houses resembled a group of discarded crab shells, shed as the\ncreature grew. Their function served, they were now scattered refuse.\nOnce, he’d imagined returning to this place triumphant. Instead, that\nreturn had eventually brought the town’s end. It surprised him how little it\nhurt, knowing he’d probably visited his birthplace for the last time.\nWell, it hadn’t been home to him in years. Instinctively, he searched out\nthe soldiers of Bridge Four. They were mingled among the other\nWindrunners and squires on the upper deck, crowding around, talking about\nsomething Kaladin couldn’t make out.\nThe group was so big now. Hundreds of Windrunners—far too many to\nfunction as the tight-knit group he’d formed in Sadeas’s army. A groan\nescaped his lips, and he blamed it on his fatigue.\nHe settled down on the deck and put his back to the railing. One of the\nardents brought him a cup of something warm, which he took gratefully—\nuntil he realized the drinks were distributed to the townspeople and\nrefugees, not the other soldiers. Did he look so bad?\nYes, he thought, glancing down at his bloodied and burned uniform. He\nvaguely remembered stumbling up to the ship with Renarin’s help, then\nbarking at the flood of Windrunners who came to fawn over him. They kept\noffering him Stormlight, but he had plenty. It surged in his veins now, but\nfor once the extra energy it lent seemed … wan. Faded.\nStop, he thought forcibly. You’ve held yourself together in rougher winds\nthan this, Kaladin. Breathe deeply. It will pass. It always does.\nHe sipped his drink, which turned out to be broth. He welcomed its\nwarmth, especially as the ship gained elevation. Many of the townspeople\ngathered near the sides, awespren bursting around them. Kaladin forced out\na smile as he closed his eyes and leaned his head back, trying to recapture\nthe wondrous feeling of taking to the air those first few times.\nInstead, he found himself reliving other darker times. When Tien had\ndied, and when he’d failed Elhokar. Foolish though it was, the second one\nhurt almost as much as the first. He hadn’t particularly liked the king.

Yet\nsomehow, seeing Elhokar die as he nearly spoke the first Radiant Ideal …\nKaladin opened his eyes as Syl flew up in the form of a miniature Fourth\nBridge. She often took the shape of natural things, but this one seemed extra\nodd. It didn’t belong in the sky. One might argue that Kaladin didn’t either.\nShe re-formed into the shape of a young woman, wearing her more\nstately dress, and landed at eye level. She waved toward the gathered\nWindrunners. “They’re congratulating Laran,” Syl explained. “She spoke\nthe Third Ideal while we were in that burning building.”\nKaladin grunted. “Good for her.”\n“Are you going to congratulate her?”\n“Later,” Kaladin said. “Don’t want to force my way through the crowd.”\nHe sighed, pressing his head back against the railing again.\nWhy didn’t I kill him? he thought. I’ll kill parshmen and Fused for\nexisting, but when I face Moash, I lock up? Why?\nHe felt so stupid. How had he been so easy to manipulate? Why hadn’t\nhe simply rammed his spear into Moash’s too-confident face and saved the\nworld a whole ton of hassle? At the least it would have shut the man up.\nStopped the words that dripped from his mouth like sludge …\nThey’re going to die … Everyone you love, everyone you think you can\nprotect. They’re all going to die anyway. There’s nothing you can do about\nit.\nI can take away the pain.…\nKaladin forced his eyes open and found Syl standing before him wearing\nher more usual dress—the flowing, girlish one that faded to mist around her\nknees. She seemed smaller than normal.\n“I don’t know what to do,” she said softly. “To help you.”\nHe glanced down.\n“The darkness in you is better some times, worse others,” she said. “But\nlately … it’s grown into something different. You seem so tired.”\n“I just need some good rest,” Kaladin said. “You think I’m bad now?\nYou should’ve seen me after Hav made me hike at double time across …\nacross…”\nHe turned away. Lying to himself was one thing. Lying to Syl was\nharder.\n“Moash did something to me,” he said. “Put me into some kind of\ntrance.”\n“I don’t think he did, Kaladin,” she whispered. “How did he know about\nthe Honor Chasm? And what you nearly did there?”\n“I told him a lot of things, back during better days. In Dalinar’s army,\nbefore Urithiru. Before…”\nWhy couldn’t he remember those times, the warm times? Sitting at the\nfire with real friends?\nReal friends including a man who had just tried to persuade him to go\nkill himself.\n“Kaladin,” Syl said, “it’s getting worse.

I can’t seem to make sense of how you feel or\nwhy you feel that way.”\n“If you ever do figure it out,” he said, “explain it to me, will you?”\nWhy couldn’t he simply shrug off what Moash had said? Why couldn’t\nhe stand up tall? Stride toward the sun like the hero everyone pretended he\nwas?\nHe opened his eyes and took a sip of his broth, but it had gone cold. He\nforced it down anyway. Soldiers couldn’t afford to be picky about\nnourishment.\nBefore long, a figure broke from the crowd of Windrunners and ambled\ntoward him. Teft’s uniform fit neatly and his beard was trimmed, but he\nseemed like an old stone now that he wasn’t glowing anymore. The type of\nmossy stone you found sitting at the base of a hill, marked by rain and the\nwinds of time; it left you wondering what it had seen in its many days.\nTeft started to sit next to Kaladin.\n“I don’t want to talk,” Kaladin snapped. “I’m fine. You don’t need to—”\n“Oh, shut up, Kal,” Teft said, sighing as he settled down. He was in his\nearly fifties, but sometimes acted like a grandfather some twenty years\nolder. “In a minute here, you’re going to go congratulate that girl for saying\nher Third Ideal. It was rough on her, like it is on most of us. She needs to\nsee your approval.”\nA protest died on Kaladin’s lips. Yes, he was highmarshal now. But the\ntruth was, every officer worth his chips knew there was a time to shut your\nmouth and do what your sergeant told you. Even if he wasn’t your sergeant\nanymore; even if there wasn’t a squad anymore.\nTeft looked up at the sky. “So, the bastard is still alive, is he?”\n“We had a confirmed sighting of him two months ago, at that battle on\nthe Veden border,” Kaladin said.\n“Aye, two months ago,” Teft said. “But I figured someone on their side\nwould have killed him by now. Have to assume they can’t stand him either.”\n“They gave him an Honorblade,” Kaladin said. “If they can’t stand him,\nthey have an odd way of showing it.”\n“What did he say?”\n“That you were all going to die,” Kaladin said.\n“Ha? Empty threats? He’s gone crazy, that one has.”\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said. “Crazy.”\nIt wasn’t a threat though, Kaladin thought. I am going to lose everyone\neventually. That’s how it works. That’s how it always works.…\n“I’ll tell the others he’s sniffing around,” Teft said. “He might try to\nattack some of us in the future.” Teft eyed him. “Renarin said he found you\nkneeling there.

And the time when Lopen had nearly died a few months back.\nAnd … well, a few others.\n“Let’s go talk to Laran,” Kaladin said, standing up.\n“Lad…”\n“You told me I had to do this, Teft,” Kaladin said. “You can storming let\nme get to it.”\nTeft fell in behind him as Kaladin went and did his duty. He let them see\nhim stand tall, let them be reassured he was still the brilliant leader they all\nknew. He had Laran summon her new Blade for him, and he congratulated\nher spren. They had few enough honorspren that he tried to always\nacknowledge them.\nAfterward, as he’d hoped, Dalinar requested Windrunners to fly him,\nNavani, and a few of the others to the Shattered Plains. Many of the\nRadiants would stay behind to guard the Fourth Bridge as it made its longer\nvoyage, but the command staff was needed for other duties.\nAfter seeing to his parents—who of course decided to stay with the\ntownspeople—Kaladin took off. At least with the wind rushing around them\nduring flight, Teft couldn’t ask any more questions.\n* * *\nNavani both loved and detested contradictions.\nOn one hand, contradictions in nature or science were testaments to the\nlogical, reasonable order of all things. When a hundred items indicated a\npattern, then one broke that pattern, it showcased how remarkable the\npattern was in the first place. Deviation highlighted natural variety.\nOn the other hand, that deviant stood out. Like a fraction on a page of\nintegers. A seven within a sequence of otherwise sublime multiples of two.\nContradictions whispered that her knowledge was incomplete.\nOr—worse—that maybe there was no sequence. Maybe everything was\nrandom chaos, and she pretended the world made sense for her own peace\nof mind.\nNavani flipped through her notes. Her featureless round chamber was too\nsmall to stand up in. It had a table—bolted to the floor—and a single chair.\nShe could touch the walls to both sides simultaneously by stretching out her\narms.\nA goblet to hold spheres was affixed to the table and fastened shut at the\ntop. She’d brought only diamonds for light, naturally. She couldn’t stand\nwhen her light was made up of a hundred different colors and sizes of gems.\nShe stretched her legs forward under the table, sighing. Hours spent in\nthis room made her long to get up and go for a walk. That wasn’t a\npossibility, so instead she laid out the offending pages on her desk.\nJasnah enjoyed finding inconsistencies in data. Navani’s daughter\nseemed to thrive on contradictions, little deviations in witness testimony,\nquestions raised by a historical account’s biased recollections.

Even today, the greed\nof artifabrians across the world prevented the greater society from learning,\ngrowing, and creating—all in the name of preserving trade secrets.\nHow many secrets had the ancient Radiants preserved for centuries, only\nto lose them in death—forcing Navani to have to discover everything anew?\nShe reached down beside her chair and picked up the fabrial Kaladin and\nLift had discovered.\nShe had no idea what to make of the thing. A collection of four garnets?\nNo spren appeared to be trapped in any of them. She didn’t recognize the\nmetal of its cage, the cut of its gemstones.… Studying the thing was like\ntrying to understand a foreign language. How had it suppressed the\nRadiants’ abilities? Was this related to the gemstones embedded in the\nweapons of the enemy soldiers, the ones that drained away Stormlight? So\nmany storming secrets.\nShe held up a sketch of the gemstone pillar at the heart of Urithiru. It is\nthe same, she thought, turning the fabrial in her hand, then comparing it to a\nsimilar-looking construction of garnets in the picture. The ones in the pillar\nwere enormous, but the cut, the arrangement of stones, the feel was the\nsame.\nWhy would the tower have a device to suppress the powers of Radiants?\nIt was their home.\nCould it be the opposite? she thought, putting down the alien fabrial and\nmaking a note in the margins of the drawing. A way to suppress the abilities\nof the Fused?\nSo much about the tower still didn’t make any sense. She had a\nBondsmith in Dalinar. Shouldn’t he and the Stormfather be able to mimic\nwhatever the long-dead tower spren had done to power the pillar and the\ntower?\nShe held up a second picture, this one of a more familiar device—a\nconstruction of three gemstones connected by chains, meant to be worn on\nthe back of the hand. A Soulcaster.\nSoulcasters had long bothered Navani. They were the proverbial flaw in\nthe system, the fabrial that didn’t make sense. Navani wasn’t a scholar\nherself, but she had a strong working knowledge of fabrials. They produced\ncertain effects, mostly amplifying, locating, or attracting specific elements\nor emotions—always tied to the type of spren trapped inside. The effects\nwere so logical that theoretical fabrials had been correctly predicted years\nbefore their successful construction.\nA technological masterpiece like the Fourth Bridge was no more than a\ncollection of smaller, simpler devices intertwined. Pair one set of\ngemstones, and you had a spanreed. Interwork hundreds, and you could\nmake a ship fly. Assuming you’d discovered how to isolate planes of motion\nand reapply force vectors through conjoined fabrials. But even these\ndiscoveries had been more small tweaks than revolutionary changes.\nEach step built on the previous ones in logical ways. It made perfect\nsense, once you understood the fundamentals.

Or could she, with study, eventually discover\ntheir secrets? For years, they’d assumed no spren were trapped in\nSoulcasting devices. But with the Oathgates, Navani could travel into\nShadesmar—and everything in the Physical Realm reflected there. Human\nbeings manifested as floating candle flames.

Navani thought, holding up the\ngemstone device Kaladin had discovered. There had to be a connection.\nAnd perhaps a connection to the tower? The secret to making it function?\nNavani shuffled through pages in her notebook, looking at the multitude\nof schematics she’d drawn during the last year. She’d been able to piece\ntogether many of the tower’s mechanics. Though they were—like\nSoulcasters—created by somehow trapping spren in Shadesmar. Their\nfunctions, however, were similar to the ones designed by modern\nartifabrians.\nThe moving lifts? A combination of conjoined fabrials and a hidden\nwaterwheel that dipped into an underground river, which flowed from\nmelting snow in the peaks. The city’s wells constantly replenished with\nfresh water? A clever manipulation of attractor fabrials, powered by ancient\ngemstones exposed to the air and the storms far beneath the tower.\nIndeed, the more she studied Urithiru, the more she saw the ancients\nusing simple fabrial technology to create their marvels. Modern artifabrians\nhad exceeded such constructs; her engineers had repaired, refitted, and\nstreamlined the lifts, making them function at several times their original\nspeed. They’d enhanced the wells and pipes, which could now draw water\nfarther up the tower into long-abandoned waterways.\nShe’d learned so much in the last year. She’d almost started to feel she\ncould deduce it all—answer the questions pertaining to time and to creation\nitself.\nThen she remembered Soulcasters. Their armies ate and remained\nmobile because of Soulcasters. Urithiru depended on extra food from\nSoulcasters. The Soulcaster cache discovered in Aimia earlier in the year\nhad brought an incredible boon to the coalition armies. They were among\nthe most coveted, important devices in modern history.\nAnd she didn’t know how they worked.\nNavani sighed, snapping her notebook shut. Her little room trembled as\nshe did so, and she frowned, leaning to the side and opening a small hatch\nin the wall. She looked out through the glass at an incongruous sight— a"

She looked out through the glass at an incongruous sight— a\ngroup of people flying in the air alongside her. The Windrunners held a\nloose formation, facing into the wind—which Navani had pointed out was a\nlittle ridiculous. Why not fly the other way? You didn’t need to see where\nyou were going.\nThey’d claimed that flying feet-first felt silly, and had refused, no matter\nhow much sense it made. They did seem to sculpt the air around themselves\nand prevent their faces from being buffeted by the worst of the winds.\nDalinar, however, had no such protection. He flew in the line—kept aloft by\na Windrunner—and wore a face mask with goggles to keep his proud nose\nfrom freezing right off.\nNavani opted for a more comfortable conveyance. Her “room” was a\nperson-size wooden sphere with long tapering points at either end to help\nwith airflow. The simple vehicle was infused by a Windrunner, then Lashed\ninto the sky. This way, Navani could ride in comfort and get some studying\ndone during extended travel.\nDalinar claimed that he liked the feeling of the wind in his face, but\nNavani suspected that he found her vehicle too close to an airborne version\nof a palanquin. A woman’s vehicle. One might assume that—in deciding to\nlearn how to read—Dalinar would no longer worry about what was\ntraditionally considered masculine or feminine. But the male ego could be\nas complicated as the most intricate fabrial.\nShe smiled at his mask and three layers of coats. Nearby, lithe scouts in\nblue flitted one way or another. Dalinar looked like a chull that had found\nitself among a flock of skyeels and was doing its best to pretend to fit in.\nShe loved that chull. Loved his stubbornness, the concern he took for\nevery decision. The way he thought with intense passion. You never got half\nof Dalinar Kholin. When he put his mind to something, you got the whole\nman—and had to simply pray to the Almighty that you could handle him.\nShe checked her clock. A trip like this, all the way from Alethkar to the\nShattered Plains, still took close to six hours—and that was with a triple\nLashing, using Dalinar’s power to provide Stormlight.\nThankfully, they were nearing the end, and she saw the Shattered Plains\napproaching ahead. Her engineers had been busy; over the last year they’d\nconstructed sturdy permanent bridges connecting many of the relevant\nplateaus. They desperately needed to be able to farm this region to supply\nUrithiru—and that meant dealing with Ialai Sadeas and her rebels.\nHopefully Navani would soon hear good news from the Lightweavers and\ntheir mission to—\nNavani cocked her head, noticing something odd. The wall beside her\nreflected a faint shade of red, blinking on and off. Like the light of a\nspanreed.\nHer immediate thought was panic. Had she somehow activated the\nstrange fabrial? If the powers of the Windrunners vanished, she’d drop from\nthe air like a stone. Her heart leapt, and her breath caught.\nShe didn’t start plummeting. And … the light wasn’t coming from the"

She leaned back, then peeked under her table. There, stuck\nto the bottom with some wax, was a tiny ruby. No, half a ruby. Part of a\nspanreed, she thought, picking it free with her fingernail.\nShe held it up between her fingers and studied the steady pulsing light.\nYes, this was a spanreed ruby—when inserted into a spanreed, it would\nconnect her to someone with the other half, allowing them to communicate.\nIt had clearly been stuck here for her to find. But who would do it so\nsneakily?\nThe Windrunners began lowering her vehicle down near the center of the\nShattered Plains, and she found herself increasingly excited by the blinking\nlight. A spanreed wouldn’t work if she was in a moving vehicle, but as they\nlanded, she dug one of her own reeds from her supplies. She had the new\nruby affixed and a piece of paper in place before anyone had time to check\non her.\nShe turned the ruby, eager to see what the unknown figure wanted to say\nto her.\nYou must stop what you are doing, the pen wrote out, using a cramped,\nnearly illegible version of the Alethi women’s script. Immediately. It waited\nfor a response.\nWhat a strange message. Navani turned the ruby and wrote her response,\nwhich would be copied for whoever had the other side of the ruby. I’m not\nsure what you mean, she wrote. Who are you? I don’t believe I’m doing\nanything that needs to be halted. Perhaps you don’t know the identity of the\nperson you are writing to. Has this spanreed been misplaced?\nNavani set the spanreed into position for a response, then turned the\nruby. When she removed her hand, the pen remained in position on the\npaper, upright. Then it started moving on its own, worked by the unseen\nperson on the other end.\nI know who you are, it wrote. You are the monster Navani Kholin. You\nhave caused more pain than any living person.\nShe cocked her head. What on Roshar?\nI couldn’t watch any longer, the pen continued. I had to stop you.\nWas it a madwoman who wrote with the other reed? The ruby started\nblinking, indicating they wanted a response.\nAll right, Navani wrote. Why don’t you tell me what it is you want me to\nstop? Also, you have neglected to give me your name.\nThe response came quickly, written as if by a fervent hand.\nYou capture spren. You imprison them. Hundreds of them. You must stop.\nStop, or there will be consequences.\nSpren? Fabrials? This woman couldn’t seriously be concerned about\nsuch a simple thing, could she? What was next? Complaining about chulls\nthat pull carts?\nI have spoken with intelligent spren, Navani wrote, such as those bonded\nto the Radiants. They agree that the spren we use for our fabrials are not\npeople, but are as unthinking as animals. They may not like the idea of what\nwe do, but they don’t think it monstrous. Even the honorspren accept it."

This is your\nwarning.\nThe pen halted, and try though she might, Navani couldn’t get any\nfurther responses from the mysterious woman or ardent who had written to\nher.\n* * *\nThe Windrunners at Urithiru had been called to one of the battlefronts for\nair support, and Kaladin was still busy with his little enterprise in Alethkar.\nSo in the end, Shallan and her team had to travel to Narak the hard way.\nFortunately, the “hard way” wasn’t too bad these days. With permanent\nbridges and a direct path maintained by soldiers, a journey that had once\ntaken days had been reduced to a few hours.\nAt the first main fortified plateau where Dalinar kept standing troops to\nwatch the warcamps, Shallan and Adolin were able to deliver up the\nprisoners—with instructions for them to be brought to Narak for\nquestioning. Adolin and Shallan requisitioned a carriage, and left the rest of\nthe troops to make their way back more slowly.\nShallan passed the time looking out the carriage window, listening to the\nclopping of the horses and watching the fractured landscape of plateaus and\nchasms. Once this had all been so difficult to traverse. Now she did it in a\nplush carriage, and considered that inconvenient compared to being flown\nabout by a Windrunner. How would it be once Navani got her flying devices\nworking efficiently? Would flying by Windrunner be the inconvenience\nthen?\nAdolin scooted over beside her, and she felt his warmth. She closed her\neyes and melted into him, breathing him in—as if she could feel his soul\nbrushing against her own.\n“Hey,” he said. “It’s not so bad. Really. Father knew this plan might\ncome to fighting. If Ialai had been willing to quietly rule in the warcamps,\nwe’d have left her alone. But we couldn’t ignore someone sitting in our\nbackyard raising an army to depose us.”\nShallan nodded.\n“That’s not what you’re worried about, is it?” Adolin asked.\n“No. Not completely.” She turned and pressed her face into his chest.\nHe’d removed his jacket, and the shirt beneath reminded her of when he\ncame to their rooms after sparring. He always wanted to bathe immediately,\nand she … well, she rarely let him. Not until she was done with him, at\nleast.\nThey rode in silence for some time, with Shallan snuggled against him.\n“You never push,” she eventually said. “Though you know I keep secrets\nfrom you.”\n“You’ll tell me eventually.”\nShe gripped his shirt tight between her fingers. “It bothers you though,\ndoesn’t it?”\nHe didn’t reply at first, which was different from his normal cheery\nassurances. “Yeah,” he finally said. “How could it not? I trust you, Shallan.\nBut sometimes … I wonder if I can trust all three of you. Veil especially.”\n“She’s trying to protect me in her own way,” Shallan said."

Gets …\nphysical with someone?”\n“That’s not a worry,” Shallan said. “I promise, and she will too if you ask\nher. We have an understanding. I’m not worried about you and me, Adolin.”\n“What are you worried about, then?”\nShe pulled closer, and couldn’t help imagining it. What he would do if\nhe knew the real her. If he knew all the things she’d actually done.\nIt wasn’t just about him. What if Pattern knew? Dalinar? Her agents?\nThey would leave, and her life would become a wasteland. She’d be\nalone, as she deserved. Because of the truths she hid, her entire life was a\nlie. Shallan, the one they all knew best, was the fakest mask of them all.\nNo, Radiant said. You can face it. You can fight it. You imagine only the\nworst possible outcome.\nBut it’s possible, isn’t it? Shallan asked. It’s possible that they would\nleave me if they knew.\nRadiant had no reply. And deep within Shallan, something else stirred.\nFormless. She had told herself that she would never create a new persona,\nand she wouldn’t. Formless wasn’t real.\nBut the possibility of it frightened Veil. And anything that frightened Veil\nterrified Shallan.\n“I will explain someday,” Shallan said softly to Adolin. “I promise.\nWhen I’m ready.”\nHe squeezed her arm in reply. She didn’t deserve him—his goodness, his\nlove. That was the trap she’d found herself in. The more he trusted her, the\nworse she felt. And she didn’t know how to get out. She couldn’t get out.\nPlease, she whispered. Save me.\nVeil reluctantly emerged. She sat up, not pulling against Adolin any\nlonger—and he seemed to understand, shifting his position in the seat. He\nhad an uncanny ability to tell which of her was in control.\n“We’re trying to help,” Veil said to him. “And we think that this year has\nbeen good for Shallan, overall. But right now, it’s probably better if we\ndiscuss another topic.”\n“Sure,” Adolin said. “Can we talk about the fact that Ialai was more\nfrightened of capture than death?”\n“She … didn’t kill herself, Adolin,” Veil said. “We are reasonably certain\nshe died from a pinprick of poison.”\nHe sat up straight. “So you’re saying someone in our team did it? One of\nmy soldiers or one of your agents?” He paused. “Or … did you do it, Veil?”\n“I didn’t,” Veil said. “But would it have been so bad if I had? We both\nknow she needed to die.”\n“She was a defenseless woman!”\n“And it’s that different from what you did to Sadeas?”\n“He was a soldier,” Adolin said. “That’s what makes it different.” He\nglanced out the window. “Maybe.

I say things like that, and…”\n“And it doesn’t sound so different from killing Ialai,” Veil said.\n“Regardless, I didn’t kill her.”\nShallan, having had a short breather, started to reemerge. Veil retreated,\nletting Shallan lean up against Adolin. He, though tense at first, let her do\nso.\nShe rested her head on his chest, listening to his heartbeat. His life.\nPulsing within him like the thunder of a captive storm. Pattern seemed to\nsense the way that pulse calmed her, for he began humming from where he\nhung on the roof.\nShe would tell Adolin everything, eventually. She’d told him some\nalready. About her father, and her mother, and her life in Jah Keved. But not\nthe deepest things, the things she didn’t even remember herself. How could\nshe tell him things that were clouded in her own memory?\nShe also hadn’t told him about the Ghostbloods. She wasn’t certain she\ncould share that secret, but could … could she try? Begin, at least? At Veil\nand Radiant’s prompting, she searched for a way. After all, Dalinar kept\nsaying that the next step was the most important one.\n“There’s something you need to know,” she said. “Before you came in,\nIalai implied that if I took her captive, she would be killed. She knew the\nblow was coming—that’s why I was suspicious of her death. She also said\nshe didn’t kill Thanadal. That it was another group called the Ghostbloods.\nShe thought the Ghostbloods would send someone for her—which was why\nshe was certain she’d die.”\n“We’ve been hunting them. Ialai was leading them.”\n“No, dear, she was leading the Sons of Honor. The Ghostbloods are a\ndifferent group.”\nHe scratched his head. “Are they the ones your … brother Helaran\nbelonged to? The one that attacked Amaram, right? And Kaladin killed\nHelaran without knowing who he was?”\n“Those were the Skybreakers. They’re not so secret any longer. They\njoined with the enemy—”\n“Right. Radiants on the other team.” Those likely made sense to him, as\nhe’d taken battlefield reports on them. The shadowy groups moving at\nnight, on the other hand, were something he couldn’t fight directly. Dealing\nwith them was to be her job.\nShe dug in her pocket as the carriage rolled over a particularly robust\nseries of bumps. This path hadn’t been graded or leveled, and though the\ncarriage driver did his best to miss the larger rockbuds, there was only so\nmuch he could do.\n“The Ghostbloods,” Shallan said, “are the people who tried to kill Jasnah\n—and me by extension—by sinking our ship.”\n“So they’re on Odium’s side,” Adolin said.\n“It’s more complicated than that.

They were trying to get to Urithiru before Jasnah, but we\nbeat them to it.” Led them to it might have been more accurate. “I’m not at\nall sure what they want those secrets for.”\n“Power,” Adolin said.\nThat response—the same one she’d given to Ialai—now seemed so\nsimplistic. Mraize, and his inscrutable master Iyatil, were deliberate, precise\npeople. Perhaps they were merely seeking to glean leverage or wealth from\nthe chaos of the end of the world. Shallan realized she would be\ndisappointed to discover that their plans were so pedestrian. Any corpse\nrobber on a battlefield could exploit the misfortune of others.\nMraize was a hunter. He didn’t wait for opportunities. He went out and\nmade them.\n“What’s that?” Adolin asked, nodding to the book in her hand.\n“Before she died,” Shallan said. “Ialai gave me a hint that led me to\nsearch the room and find this.”\n“That’s why you didn’t want the guards to do it,” he said. “Because one\nof them might be a spy or assassin. Storms.”\n“You might want to reassign your soldiers to boring, out-of-the-way\nposts for a season.”\n“These are some of my best men!” Adolin complained. “Highly\ndecorated! They just pulled off an extremely dangerous covert operation.”\n“So give them a rest at some quiet post,” Shallan said. “Until we figure\nthis out. I’ll watch my agents. If I discover it’s one of them, you can bring\nthe men back.”\nHe sulked at the suggestion; he hated the idea of punishing a group of\ngood men because one of them might be a spy. Adolin might claim he was\ndifferent from his father, but in fact they were two shades of the same paint.\nOften, two similar colors clashed worse than wildly different ones would.\nShallan kicked the bag of notes and letters that Gaz had gathered, resting\nat their feet. “We’ll give that to your father’s scribes, but I’ll look through\nthis book personally.”\n“What’s in it?” Adolin asked, leaning to the side so he could see—but\nthere were no pictures.\n“I haven’t read the entire thing,” Shallan said. “It seems to be Ialai’s\nattempts to piece together what the Ghostbloods are planning. Like this\npage—a list of terms or names her spies had heard. She was trying to define\nwhat they were.” Shallan moved her finger down the page. “Nalathis.\nScadarial. Tal Dain. Do you recognize any of those?”\n“They sound like nonsense to me. Nalathis might have something to do\nwith Nalan, the Skybreaker Herald.”\nIalai had noticed the same connection, but indicated these names might\nbe places—ones she could not find in any atlas. Perhaps they were like\nFeverstone Keep, the place Dalinar had seen in his visions.

Kaladin’s Windrunners were\nLashing Dalinar and the others; all Kaladin had to do was fly at the head of\nthem all and look confident.\nI’ve spoken to Yunfah again, Syl said in his mind. He’s here on the\nPlains. I think he wants to talk to you.\n“Tell him to come up and see me, then,” Kaladin said. His voice was lost\nto the rushing wind, but Syl would catch it anyway.\nShe flitted off, followed by a few windspren. From this distance, Kaladin\ncould almost make out the pattern to the Shattered Plains. So he gave a\nhand signal and reduced to a single Lashing.\nA short time later, two blue-white ribbons of light came zipping up\ntoward him. He could somehow tell Syl from the other one. There was a\nspecific shade to her, as familiar to him as his own face.\nThe other light resolved into the shape of a tiny old man reclining on a\nsmall cloud as he flew beside Kaladin. The spren, Yunfah, had been bonded\nto Vratim, a Windrunner who had died a few months ago. At first, when\nthey’d begun losing Radiants in battle, Kaladin had worried it would cause\nhim to lose the spren as well. Syl, after all, had gone comatose many\ncenturies ago when she’d lost her first Radiant.\nOthers, however, handled it differently. The majority, though grieved,\nseemed to want another bond soon—as it helped them move past the pain of\nloss. Kaladin didn’t pretend to understand spren psychology, but Yunfah\nhad seemed to deal with the death of his Radiant well. Treating it as a\nbattlefield loss of an ally, rather than the destruction of part of his own soul.\nIndeed, Yunfah appeared willing to bond another.\nSo far, he hadn’t—and for reasons Kaladin couldn’t understand. And as\nfar as Kaladin knew, he was the sole free honorspren among them.\nHe says, Syl told Kaladin in his mind, that he’s still considering picking\na new knight. He’s narrowed it down to five possibilities.\n“Is Rlain one of them?”\nYunfah stood up on his cloud, his long beard whipping in the wind—\nthough he had no real substance. Kaladin could read anger in his posture\nbefore Syl gave him the reply. She was acting as intermediary since the\nsound of the rushing wind was fairly loud, even at a single Lashing.\nNo, Syl said. He is angry at your repeated suggestion he bond one of the\nenemies.\n“He won’t find a potential Windrunner more capable or earnest.”\nHe’s acting mad, Syl said. But I do think he’ll agree if you push him. He\nrespects you, and honorspren like hierarchy. The ones who have joined us\ndid so against the will of the general body of their peers; they’ll be looking\nfor someone to be in charge.\nAll right then. “As your highmarshal and superior officer,” Kaladin said,\n“I forbid you to bond anyone else unless you try to work with Rlain first.”\nThe elderly spren shook his fist at Kaladin.\n“You have two choices, Yunfah,” Kaladin said, not waiting for Syl."

I’m tired of waiting on your\nindecisiveness.”\nThe spren glared at him.\n“Will you follow orders?”\nThe spren spoke.\nHe asks how long you’ll give him, Syl explained.\n“Ten days,” Kaladin said. “And that is generous.”\nYunfah said something, then sped away, becoming a ribbon of light. Syl\npulled up alongside Kaladin’s head.\nHe said “fine” before leaving, she said. I have little doubt he’ll at least\nconsider Rlain now. Yunfah doesn’t want to go back to Shadesmar; he likes\nthis realm too much.\nKaladin nodded, and felt uplifted by the result. If this worked out, Rlain\nwould be thrilled.\nFollowed by the others, Kaladin swooped down toward Narak, their\noutpost at the center of the Shattered Plains. Navani’s engineers were\nturning the entire plateau from ruins into a fortified base. A wall to the east\n—easily six feet wide at its foot—was being built, low and squat, against\nthe storms. A thinner wall wrapped the rest of the plateau, and lightning\nrods helped protect from the Everstorm.\nKaladin alighted on top of the wall and surveyed the fort. The engineers\nhad scraped away most of the old Parshendi buildings, preserving only the\nmost ancient of the ruins for study. Supply dumps, barracks, and storm\ncisterns rose around them now. With the wall going right up to the chasm,\nand with collapsible bridges outside, this isolated plateau was quickly\nbecoming impregnable from ordinary ground assault.\n“Imagine if the Parshendi had known modern fortification techniques,”\nKaladin said to Syl as she blew past in the shape of tumbling leaves. “A few\nstrategic forts set up like this across the Plains, and we’d never have broken\nthem out.”\n“As I recall,” she replied, “we didn’t so much break them out as\npurposely fall into their trap and hope it wouldn’t hurt too much.”\nNearby, the other Windrunners lowered Dalinar, some of the\nEdgedancers, and Navani’s wooden travel vehicle. That had been a good\nidea, although it was a little harder to keep the larger object in the air. The\nthing had four fins on it, like an arrow. They’d started with two wings—\nwhich Navani had thought would make the vehicle fly better, but which had\nmade it pull upward uncontrollably once a Windrunner Lashed it.\nHe hopped down from his perch. Syl whirled in a long arc around the old\npillar at this edge of the plateau. Tall, with steps along the outside, it had\nbecome a perfect scout nest. Rlain said it had been used in Parshendi\nceremonies, but he hadn’t known its original purpose. Much of these ruins\n—the remnants of a once-grand city that had stood during the shadowdays\n—baffled them."

Much of these ruins\n—the remnants of a once-grand city that had stood during the shadowdays\n—baffled them.\nPerhaps the two Heralds could explain the pillar. Had they walked here?\nUnfortunately—considering that one of them was full-on delusional and the\nother dabbled in it now and then—he wasn’t certain they’d be useful in this.\nHe wanted to get to Urithiru as quickly as possible. Before people had a\nchance to start talking to him again, trying—with forced laughs—to cheer\nhim up. He walked over to Dalinar, who was taking a report from the\nbattalionlord who commanded Narak. Oddly, Navani hadn’t emerged from\nher vehicle yet. Perhaps she was lost in her research.\n“Permission to take the first group back, sir,” Kaladin said. “I want to go\nclean up.”\n“A moment, Highmarshal,” Dalinar said to Kaladin, scanning the written\nreport. The battalionlord, a gruff fellow with an Oldblood tattoo, looked\naway pointedly.\nThough Dalinar had never said he’d moved to written reports specifically\nto make his officers confront the idea of a man reading, Kaladin could see\nthe showmanship in the way he held up the sheet and nodded to himself as\nhe read.\n“What happened to Brightness Ialai is regrettable,” Dalinar said. “See\nthat her decision to take her own life is published. I authorize a full\noccupation of the warcamps. See it done.”\n“Yes, Your Majesty,” the battalionlord said. Dalinar was a king now,\nofficially recognized by the coalition of monarchs as ruler of Urithiru—a\nstation separate from Jasnah’s queenship over Alethkar. In acknowledgment\nof this, Dalinar had officially renounced any idea of being a “highking”\nover any other monarch.\nDalinar handed the sheet to the battalionlord, then nodded to Kaladin.\nThey walked off from the others, then a little further, to a section of the base\nbetween two Soulcast grain shelters. The king didn’t speak at first, but\nKaladin knew this trick. It was an old disciplinary tactic—you left silence\nhanging in the air. That made your man begin explaining himself first. Well,\nKaladin didn’t bite.\nDalinar studied him, taking note of his burned and bloodied uniform.\nFinally, he spoke. “I have multiple reports of you and your soldiers letting\nenemy Fused go once you’ve wounded them.”\nKaladin relaxed immediately. That was what Dalinar wanted to talk\nabout?\n“I think we’re starting to reach a kind of understanding with them, sir,”\nKaladin said. “The Heavenly Ones fight with honor. I let one of them go\ntoday. In turn, their leader—Leshwi—released one of my men instead of\nkilling him.”\n“This isn’t a game, son,” Dalinar said. “This isn’t about who gets first\nblood. We’re literally fighting for the existence of our people.”\n“I know,” Kaladin said quickly. “But this can serve us. You’ve noticed\nalready how they’ll hold back and attack us one-on-one, so long as we play\nby their rules. Considering how many more Heavenly Ones there are than\nWindrunners, I think we want to encourage this kind of encounter. Killing"

Considering how many more Heavenly Ones there are than\nWindrunners, I think we want to encourage this kind of encounter. Killing\nthem is barely an inconvenience, as they’ll be reborn. But each of ours they\nkill requires training an entirely new Windrunner. Getting back wounded for\nwounded favors us.”\n“You never did want to fight the parshmen,” Dalinar said. “Even when\nyou first joined my army, you didn’t want to be sent against the Parshendi.”\n“I didn’t like the idea of killing people who showed us honor, sir.”\n“Does it strike you as odd to find it among them?” Dalinar asked. “The\nAlmighty—Honor himself—was our god. The one their god killed.”\n“I used to think it odd. But sir, wasn’t Honor their god before he was\nours?”\nThat was one of the revelations that had shaken the foundation of the\nRadiants—both ancient and new. Though many of the orders had accepted\nthe truth as an oddity and moved on, many Windrunners had not. Nor had\nDalinar; Kaladin could see the way he winced whenever the idea was\ndiscussed.\nThis world had belonged to the singers with Honor as their god. Until\nhumans had arrived, bringing Odium.\n“All of this highlights a bigger problem,” Dalinar said. “This war is\nincreasingly being fought in the skies. Navani’s flying transport will only\nescalate the situation. We need more honorspren and Windrunners.”\nKaladin looked to where Syl hung in the air beside him. Dalinar fixed his\ngaze on her a moment later, so she must have decided to reveal herself to\nhim.\n“I’m sorry,” she said softly. “My relatives can be … difficult.”\n“They have to see that we’re fighting for the survival of Roshar as much\nas for the survival of the Alethi,” Dalinar said. “We can’t do that without\ntheir help.”\n“To my cousins, you are dangerous,” Syl said. “As dangerous as the\nsingers. The betrayal of the Knights Radiant killed so many of them.…”\n“The other spren have begun coming around,” Kaladin said. “They see\nit.”\n“Honorspren are more … rigid,” she said. “Most of them at least.” She\nshrugged and looked to the side, as if ashamed. Human gestures from her\nwere so common these days that Kaladin barely paused to notice them.\n“We need to do something,” Dalinar said. “It’s been eight months\nwithout a new honorspren coming to us.” He eyed Kaladin. “But that’s a\nproblem I suppose I’ll continue to contemplate. For now, I’m worried about\nthe way the Heavenly Ones and the Windrunners are interacting. It smacks\nof neither of you giving this your all—and I can’t have soldiers on the\nbattlefield that I worry won’t be able to fight when the pressure mounts.”\nKaladin felt cold as he met Dalinar’s eyes. So. This conversation was\nabout Kaladin after all. What had happened to him.\nAgain.\n“Kaladin,” Dalinar said. “You’re one of the best soldiers I’ve ever had\nthe privilege of leading.

You single-\nhandedly built up what has become the most important wing of my military\n—and did all this while living through the worst nightmare I could imagine.\nYou are an inspiration to everyone who meets you.”\n“Thank you, sir.”\nDalinar nodded, then put his hand on Kaladin’s shoulder. “It’s time that I\nrelieved you of duty, son. I’m sorry.”\nA jolt went through Kaladin. Like the shock of being stabbed—or the\nfeeling of suddenly coming awake in an unfamiliar place, frightened by a\nsudden noise. A visceral clenching of the stomach. A sudden racing of the\nheart. Every piece of you alert, looking for the fight.\n“No,” he whispered. “Sir, I know how it seems.”\n“How does it seem?” Dalinar asked. “Diagnose yourself, Kaladin. Tell\nme what you see.”\nKaladin closed his eyes. No.\nDalinar gripped his shoulder tighter. “I’m no surgeon, but I can tell you\nwhat I see. A soldier who has been on the front lines for far, far too long. A\nman who has survived so many horrors, he now finds himself staring at\nnothing, his mind going numb so he doesn’t have to remember. I see a\nsoldier who can’t sleep, who snaps at those who love him. He’s a soldier\nwho pretends he can still function. But he can’t. He knows it.”\nKaladin knocked Dalinar’s hand away, snapping open his eyes. “You\ncan’t do this. I built the Windrunners. They’re my team. You can’t take that\nfrom me.”\n“I will because I have to,” Dalinar said. “Kaladin, if you were anyone\nelse, I’d have pulled you from active duty months ago. But you’re you, and\nI kept telling myself we needed every Windrunner.”\n“That’s true!”\n“We need every functional Windrunner. I’m sorry. There was a point\nwhere if I’d removed you from command, it would have destroyed the\nmomentum of the entire team. We’re safely past that now. You will still be\nwith us … but you won’t be going on any more missions.”\nA growling sound escaped Kaladin’s throat, one a piece of him refused\nto believe he was making. He sucked in Stormlight.\nHe would not be beaten down again. He would not let some lighteyed\nblowhard take everything from him again. “I can’t believe this!” Kaladin\nsaid, angerspren pooling underneath him. “You were supposed to be\ndifferent. You—”\n“Why?” Dalinar asked, standing calmly.\n“Why what?” Kaladin snapped.\n“Why am I different?”\n“Because you don’t throw us away!” Kaladin shouted. “Because you …\nBecause…”\nBecause you care about your men.\nKaladin deflated. He suddenly felt small. A child standing before a stern\nparent. He wavered, putting his back to the nearest building. Syl hung\nbeside him, looking concerned, confused.

He’d brought most of what had been Bridge Four\nwith him; the Windrunners he’d left to protect the airship had once been\nBridge Thirteen and their squires.\nSo he saw a lot of friendly faces standing in the distant Narak courtyard.\nRock and Teft. Renarin. Sigzil, Lyn, Lopen. Leyten and Peet, Skar and\nDrehy. Laran, newly forged as a full Radiant. None had yet spoken the\nFourth Ideal. He liked to think that it was as hard for them as it was for him,\nand none had yet cracked it. But … but could they be restraining\nthemselves because of him? Out of some misguided respect?\nHe turned back to Dalinar. “What if I’m not there?” he pled. One final\ncomplaint. “What if something happens when they’re out fighting? What if\none of them dies because I couldn’t protect them?”\n“Kaladin,” Dalinar said softly, “what if something happens because you\nare with them? What if one of them dies because they expect your help, but\nyou freeze again?”\nKaladin breathed in sharply. He turned aside and squeezed his eyes shut,\nfeeling tears leak out. What if …\nStorms, Dalinar was right.\nHe was right.\n“I…” he whispered. What were the Words?\nYou couldn’t say the Words, he thought. You needed to. A year ago, when\nDalinar could have died. You needed to speak the Words. You crumpled\ninstead.\nKaladin would never say them, would he? He was finished at the Third\nIdeal. Other spren had said … said that many Radiants never spoke the later\noaths.\nKaladin took a deep breath and forced his eyes open. “What … what do I\ndo now?”\n“You aren’t being demoted,” Dalinar said firmly. “I want you training,\nteaching, and helping us fight this war. Don’t be ashamed, son. You fought\nwell. You survived things no man should have to. That sort of experience\nleaves scars, same as any wound. It’s all right to admit to them.”\nKaladin brushed his fingers at his forehead and the scars he still bore.\nUnhealed, despite all of his powers, years after he’d been branded.\nDalinar cleared his throat, seeming uncomfortable. Perhaps, upon\nremembering Kaladin’s wound, he thought the mention of scars to be in\npoor taste. It wasn’t. The metaphor was particularly sound.\n“Can … can I keep my oaths without fighting?” Kaladin asked. “I need\nto protect.”\n“There are many ways to protect,” Dalinar said. “Not all Radiants went\ninto battle in the old days. I myself have found many ways to serve this war\nwithout swinging a Blade on the front lines.”\nKaladin looked to Syl, who nodded. Yes, he could keep his oaths this\nway.\n“You won’t be the first celebrated soldier who has moved to a support\nposition after seeing one too many friends die,” Dalinar said to Kaladin.\n“God Beyond willing, we’ll persuade the honorspren to work with us—and"

You’ll be of great use\noverseeing Radiant training either way.”\n“I just won’t be anywhere I can cause harm,” Kaladin whispered.\n“Because I’m broken.”\nDalinar took him by the shoulder once more, then raised his other hand,\nholding up a finger, as if to force Kaladin to focus on it.\n“This,” Dalinar said, “is what war does to all of us. It chews us up and\nspits us out mangled. There’s no dishonor in taking a step away to recover.\nNo more than there’s dishonor in giving yourself time to heal from a stab\nwound.”\n“So I’ll come back to the battle?” Kaladin asked. “I’ll take a leave, then\nreturn?”\n“If we feel it’s right for you to do so. Yes, that’s possible.”\nPossible, Kaladin thought. But not likely. Dalinar had probably seen\nmore men succumb to battle fatigue than Kaladin had—but in all his years\nof fighting, Kaladin had never seen someone recover. It didn’t seem the\nkind of thing you got over.\nIf only he’d been stronger. Why hadn’t he said the Words?\n“We’ll find a way to make this a smooth, natural transition,” Dalinar\npromised him. “We can introduce it to the others in whatever way you’d\nlike. That said, we’re also not going to delay. This isn’t a request, Kaladin.\nIt’s an order. From now on, you stay out of battle.”\n“Yes, sir,” Kaladin said.\nDalinar squeezed his shoulder. “You’re not valuable to me because of\nhow many enemies you can kill. It’s because you’re man enough to\nunderstand, and to say words like those.” He nodded, letting go. “This is not\na disciplinary action, Kaladin. I’ll have new orders for you tomorrow. You\ncan trust that I will put you to work. We will explain to everyone else that\nit’s a promotion.”\nKaladin forced out a smile, and that seemed to relieve Dalinar. Had to\nkeep on a good face. Had to look strong.\nDon’t let him know.\n“Sir,” Kaladin said. “I’m not sure I’ll be able to take a post training other\nRadiants. Being with the Windrunners, sending them off to die without\nme … well, sir, it would rip me apart. I don’t think I could see them fly, and\nnot join them.”\n“I hadn’t considered that.” Dalinar frowned. “If you’d rather request\nanother duty, I will allow it. Perhaps in logistics or battle planning? Or\nmaybe as an ambassador to Thaylenah or Azir. Your reputation would put\nyou in high esteem there. At any rate, I won’t have someone like you sitting\naround growing crem. You’re too valuable.”\nSure. Of course. Take from me the one thing that matters, then tell me\nI’m valuable.

I might need time to decide what I want, though.”\n“Very well,” Dalinar said. “You have ten days. Before then, I want you\nto report to me your decision.”\nKaladin nodded. He put on another smile, which had the intended effect\nof convincing Dalinar not to worry. The man walked over to the other\nWindrunners.\nKaladin looked away, feeling his stomach twist. His friends laughed and\njoked with one another, in high spirits. So far as they knew, the\nWindrunners hadn’t lost any members today.\nThey didn’t know the truth—that they’d taken a single profound\ncasualty. His name had been Kaladin Stormblessed.\nAn iron cage will create an attractor—a fabrial that draws specific\nelements to itself. A properly created smoke fabrial, for example, can\ngather the smoke of a fire and hold it close.\nNew discoveries lead us to believe it is possible to create a repeller\nfabrial, but we don’t yet know the metal to use to achieve this feat.\n—Lecture on fabrial mechanics presented by Navani Kholin to\nthe coalition of monarchs, Urithiru, Jesevan, 1175\n“Quickly, up the stairs!” Venli shouted the words to the Rhythm of\nCommand. “The lady returns!”\nThe servants scrambled up the tower steps. They didn’t need Venli to\norder them about, but it was expected of her, and she’d gotten very good at\nplaying the role. She didn’t whip them as some might—most of the shanay-\nim disliked such physical punishments, fortunately—but she did grab Vod\nout of line and straighten his shirt and sash. He hummed to Appreciation in\nthanks as she shoved him after the rest.\nLast in line, Venli grabbed her scepter and hurried up the steps. The\nothers ahead of her wore workform or nimbleform, so she towered over\nthem in envoyform.\nThere were a variety of different levels a person could have in the singer\nculture. Normal people—simply called singers, or common singers—had\nordinary forms such as workform or warform. Then there were forms of\npower, like Venli’s envoyform. This was a level higher in authority and\nstrength, and required taking a Voidspren into your gemheart. That\ninfluenced your mind, changed how you perceived the world. These singers\nwere called Regals.\nFurther up the hierarchy were the Fused. Ancient souls put into a modern\nbody, which extinguished the soul of the host completely. And above them?\nMysterious creatures like the thunderclasts and the Unmade. Souls more\nlike spren than people. Venli still didn’t know much about them.\nServing one of the Fused was difficult enough. She hurried up the steps,\nwhich wound dizzily around the spire. This wasn’t a proper fortification; it\nwas no more than a column of stone with wooden steps—basically a\nstaircase into the sky. The design reminded her of the tall stone pillar in\nNarak."

The design reminded her of the tall stone pillar in\nNarak.\nAt the top of the spire, she entered a room that gave her vertigo. Open on\ntwo sides, the room looked out over the grand city of Kholinar—and there\nwere no railings to prevent a careless worker from toppling a hundred feet\nto the city streets below. Though the footing was sound, it felt unstable, like\na tower of blocks with a too-large capstone, awaiting the inevitable child’s\nfoot.\nThe storms should have destroyed these tower rooms on first blow. But\nthe Fused had overseen their construction, and so far only one in the line of\ntwenty had been felled by a highstorm and needed to be rebuilt. That one\nhad caused heavy damage to the homes below, of course—but there was\nlittle use seeking logic in the ways of the Fused.\nVenli stepped to the front of the group of servants, sweating from the\nprotracted climb. Her form of power was slender and tall, with long orange-\nred hairstrands and delicate carapace along the cheeks and in ridges on the\nbacks of the hands. Not armor; more like ornamentation. It wasn’t a fighting\nform, more intended to inspire awe—and give her powers to translate text\nand languages.\nThough she was a Regal, she held a secret deep within her gemheart, a\nfriend who protected her from the Voidspren’s influence. Her Radiant spren\n—Timbre—buzzed softly, comforting her.\nVenli scanned the horizon and finally picked out figures approaching as\ndots in the sky. Though Venli had rushed the others, none would complain.\nYou didn’t question a Regal—and besides, they’d rather be shouted at by\nVenli than suffer punishment from a Fused. Leshwi was fair, but that did not\nmean her anger was tame.\nSoon the shanay-im—Those Ones of the Heavens—came streaking into\nthe city. Only the most important of them merited tower rooms like this one,\nand so the majority swooped down toward more conventional housing in\nthe city proper. Leshwi, however, was among Odium’s elite. She wasn’t the\nmost powerful, but was lofty compared even to most Fused.\nPart of Leshwi’s favor had to do with her prowess in battle, but Venli\nsuspected an equal measure came because she’d maintained her sanity over\nthe centuries. The same could not be said for many, though the Heavenly\nOnes had fared better than other kinds of Fused. The nine varieties were\ncalled “brands” in their own language, a word evoking the heat of a\nbranding iron, though Venli had seen no such mark on their skin.\nLeshwi slowed as she approached, her traveling garb—bright white and\nred this time—rippling in the wind. It trailed a good thirty feet below and\nbehind her, and she wore her hair loose. She reached her hands to the sides\nas she landed, and servants immediately came forward to unhook clasps and\nremove the longer parts of the train. Others brought water and fruit, bowing\nas they held the bowls toward her.\nLeshwi waited for her garments to be unhooked before taking\nrefreshment.

She glanced at Venli, but made no sound, so Venli remained\nwhere she was—standing tall, holding her scepter. She had long since\novercome her initial fears that she’d be found out for the fraud she was.\nOnce the long train was removed, other servants helped Leshwi out of\nthe robes. A few servants averted their eyes from the sight of her flowing\nundergarments—but Leshwi didn’t care about mortal feelings of propriety.\nShe didn’t so much as hum a note of Embarrassment, though in this\nincarnation, the body that had been offered to her was malen.\nIndeed, after drinking and being wrapped in her robes of luxury, she sat\ndown to be seen by the barber, who shaved her face after the manner of\nhumans. She hated whiskers, even if the ones she grew when inhabiting a\nmalen body were soft and faint. The Fused exerted some measure of will\nupon their forms—skin patterns persisted, for example, and some grew\ncarapace in individual patterns. Knowing that, you could easily distinguish\nthe same Fused across multiple incarnations.\nOf course, Venli had the advantage of her ability to look into Shadesmar\n—which immediately told her if someone was Fused, Regal, or ordinary\nsinger. She tried very hard not to use that ability except in the most secret of\nlocations. It would be a disaster of incredible proportions if anyone figured\nout that Venli—Last Listener, envoyform Regal, Voice of Lady Leshwi—\nwas a Knight Radiant.\nSound thrummed through her. Timbre could read her thoughts—and\nVenli could read the little spren’s words and intents through the pulsing of\nher rhythms. In this case, Timbre wanted Venli to acknowledge she was not\na Knight Radiant. Not yet, as she’d only said the First Ideal. She had work\nto do if she wanted to progress.\nShe acknowledged this quietly; she grew uncomfortable if Timbre pulsed\nwhen a Fused was near. There was no telling what might give her away.\nConsidering that, she pointedly did not look at Dul and Mazish among\nthe servants. At least not until they brought the new recruit forward—a\nyoung femalen in workform, bright lines of red marbling her otherwise\nblack skin. Venli hummed to Indifference, pretending to inspect the\nnewcomer—whose name was Shumin—though they’d met several times in\nsecret.\nFinally, Venli stepped up to Leshwi, who was still being shaved. Venli\nwaited to be acknowledged—a sign given her when Leshwi hummed to\nSatisfaction.\n“This one,” Venli said, waving to Shumin, “has been determined worthy\nof service. Your stormsetter needs a new assistant.” The stormsetter made\ncertain Leshwi’s possessions in the High Chamber were packed before each\nstorm, then reset afterward.\nLeshwi hummed. Though it was a short beat done to Craving, it meant\nso much more to Venli. The longer she’d held envoyform, the more\nremarkable its abilities had become.

In fact, the experience was eerily familiar to the way she\nunderstood Timbre—yet she was certain that ability wasn’t related to her\nform.\nRegardless, as Leshwi’s Voice, Venli’s duty was to express the lady’s\ndesires to others.\n“The lady wishes to know,” Venli said to Derision, “if this newcomer can\nembrace the height of the chamber.”\nShe pointed, and Shumin stepped nervously to the edge of the room,\nbeside the drop-off. The chamber was large enough that, standing among\nthe lady’s furniture at the center, one might be able to ignore how high they\nwere.\nVenli strode over and joined Shumin. Here at the edge, there was no\npretending or denying. With your toes to the rim, feeling the wind press you\nfrom behind as if to shove you off into the sky above the sunlit streets …\nVenli was not particularly afraid of heights, but part of her wanted to run to\nthe center of the room and hug the floor. People were not meant to be this\nhigh. This was the domain of stormclouds and thunder, not singers.\nShumin quaked, drawing some fearspren, but she stood firm. She stared\noutward, however, and did not look down.\n“Passion,” Venli said softly, to Determination—one of the old rhythms.\nThe pure rhythms of Roshar. “Remember that with the Fused, your Passion\nwill do you credit. To hold this post, you must match fear with\ndetermination.”\nIt was the great contradiction of serving the Fused. They did not want\nsimpering children who were too quick to obey, but they also expected\nexactness in service. They wanted only the strongest of wills among their\nfollowers—but wished to control and dominate them.\nShumin hummed to the Rhythm of Winds, then looked down at the city.\nVenli made her stand an uncomfortable minute, then hummed and turned,\nwalking back. Shumin followed with hasty steps, sweating visibly.\n“She seems timid,” Leshwi said to Venli, speaking in their ancient\nlanguage.\n“We are all timid when we begin,” Venli replied. “She will serve well.\nHow can one sing with Passion if never given a chance to learn the proper\nsongs?”\nLeshwi took the towel from her barber and wiped her face, then selected\na fruit from the bowl offered nearby. She inspected it for flaws. “You are\ncompassionate to them, despite your attempts to appear stiff and stern. I can\nsee the truth in you, Venli, Last Listener.”\nIf that were so, Venli thought, I would undoubtedly be dead by now.\n“I favor compassion,” Leshwi said, “so long as it does not override\nworthier Passions.” She began eating her fruit, giving instruction in a quick\nhum.\n“You are accepted,” Venli said to Shumin. “Serve with devotion, and you\nwill be taught to speak the words of the gods and sing the rhythms of lost\npeoples.”\nShumin hummed her pleasure, backing away to join the others. Venli\ncaught the eye of Dul, the stormsetter, and he nodded before fetching the\nnext item of business."

Venli\ncaught the eye of Dul, the stormsetter, and he nodded before fetching the\nnext item of business.\n“If I may,” Venli said, turning to Leshwi. “Did you kill him on this\nexcursion?”\nThere was no need to explain “him.” Leshwi was fascinated by the\nWindrunners, and in particular their leader—the young man who had forged\na group of Radiants without the guidance of god or Herald.\nLeshwi finished her fruit before giving a reply. “He was there,” Leshwi\nsaid. “And so was his spren, though she did not appear to me. We fought.\nNo conclusion. Though I fear I might not have a chance to face him again.”\nVenli hummed to Craving, to indicate her curiosity.\n“He killed Lezian, the Pursuer.”\n“I do not know that name,” Venli said. With that title, the creature must\nbe one of the Fused. As beings thousands of years old, each one had a lore\nand history long enough to fill books. It angered them that no one knew\nthem individually this time around.\nIndeed, Leshwi spoke to Derision when she replied, “You will. He is\nnewly reawakened, but always worms his way into the stories and minds of\nmortals. He takes great pride in it.”\nAnd the rest of you don’t? Venli kept the comment in. Leshwi\nappreciated Passion—but wry comments were entirely different.\n“Is there other business for me?” Leshwi asked.\n“One other matter,” Venli said, gesturing as Dul arrived with a very\nfrightened woman in tow. A human woman, thin and somewhat scrawny,\nwith long curling eyebrows. She was dressed in the humble clothing of a\nworker. “You asked me to find a tailor who could experiment with new\ndesigns. This one was of that profession once.”\n“A human,” Leshwi said. “Curious.”\n“You wished for the best,” Venli said. “Our people are learning to excel\nin many areas, but mastering some professions requires much longer than\nthe year we’ve had. If you wish for an expert tailor, you will need a\nhuman.”\nLeshwi stood, then rose into the air, her robes of luxury—gold and stark\nblack—trailing beneath her. She hummed a message to Venli.\n“The great lady wishes to know your name,” Venli said.\n“Yokska, great one,” said the cowering woman.\n“You were a tailor?” Venli said, Voicing for Leshwi.\n“Yes, once I dressed princes and lighteyes. I know … I know the most\ncurrent of fashions.”\n“Your fashions and clothing will not suit a Fused,” Venli Voiced. “The\ndesigns will be unfamiliar to you.”\n“I … I live to serve…” Yokska said.\nVenli glanced at Leshwi and knew immediately from the lady’s hummed\ntone that this servant would be rejected. Was it the woman’s mannerisms?\nToo cowering? Perhaps she didn’t look presentable enough—though Venli\nhad decided against dressing Yokska well, as that could offend the Fused.\n“A human will not do,” Leshwi said. “To elevate this one would be to"

In any case, tell her to stand up and\nmeet my eyes. So many of these are cremlings.”\n“Can they be blamed? Other Fused beat humans who meet their eyes.”\nLeshwi hummed to Fury, and Venli met the tone with her own. At this,\nLeshwi smiled. “It is a problem among my kind,” Leshwi admitted. “The\nnine brands do not present uniform expectations of the humans. But still,\nthis one cannot be my tailor. Already there are comments and questions\nabout the raising of a human to the title of He Who Quiets. I would not heap\nup fuel for those seeking to prove we are soft. Save your hidden\ncompassion for your own, Voice. But perhaps allow this one to teach a\nsinger wearing artform, so they may learn her skill.”\nVenli bowed her head, humming to Subservience. She would have been\npleased regardless of the outcome—this was mostly a test to see what her\nlady thought of the humans. Leshwi spoke so often of the Windrunners,\nVenli was curious whether she would sympathize with a human of lower\nstation.\n“My tasks are done,” Leshwi said. “I will meditate. Empty the High\nChamber and see that the new servant is properly trained.” She rose through\na hole in the roof, seeking the clouds.\nVenli thumped her scepter against the wooden floor, and the other\nservants began to disperse down the steps. Several helped the human\nwoman.\nVenli made Shumin wait. Once everyone was safely on their way, she led\nthe newcomer down the long winding steps to her own room: the\nguardhouse that one needed to pass through to reach the steps. Venli’s\nposition was, quite literally, the gate one needed to pass in order to\napproach Leshwi.\nDul waited beside the hatch that closed off access to the steps above.\nShumin made as if to speak, but Venli quieted her, waiting until Dul closed\nthe hatch and the window shades. Mazish returned from checking outside,\nthen closed the door behind her. Dul and Mazish were married. Not once-\nmates, as the listeners would have called it, but married. They had insisted\nafter having their minds restored; they’d been mates while enslaved by the\nhumans, and had adopted Alethi ways.\nVenli had a great deal of work to do. She needed to counteract the\nindoctrination of the Fused and help the singers cast off the traditions of\nthose who had enslaved them. But a cremling did not shed its shell until it\nhad grown too large for it; she hoped her guidance would eventually\nencourage them to shed—of their own choice—the burdens of both Fused\nand human society.\n“You may speak now,” Venli said to Shumin. Venli changed her rhythm\nto that of Confidence—one of the old rhythms. The true rhythms,\nuncorrupted by the touch of Odium.\n“Stormfather!” Shumin said, turning to Dul and Mazish. “That was\ndifficult. You didn’t tell me she was going to practically dangle me off the\nedge!”"

You didn’t tell me she was going to practically dangle me off the\nedge!”\n“We warned you it would be hard,” Dul said to Reprimand.\n“Well, I think I did pretty well otherwise,” Shumin said, looking to\nVenli. “Right? Brightness, what did you think?”\nThe change in the femalen’s attitude made Venli sick. She was so …\nhuman. From her curses to her way of gesturing when she spoke. But then,\nthose who were most loyal to the Fused were unlikely to join Venli. She\nwould work with what she had.\n“I worry you were overly timid,” Venli said. “The Fused do not want\nweakness, and neither do I. Our organization is formed from those who are\nstrong enough to resist, and eventually break free of, all chains.”\n“I’m ready,” Shumin said. “When do we attack the Fused? Each storm I\nworry I’ll be next, and that one of the waiting Fused souls will boot my\nmind out and take over.”\nIt didn’t work that way. Venli had witnessed the transformation; she’d\nnearly been taken herself. Accepting the soul of a Fused into your body had\nan element of agency to it.\nAgency, however, was difficult to define. If you took a Regal form,\nOdium got inside your mind. New forms with their new rhythms altered\nyour mannerisms, your way of seeing the world. Even common singers\nwere carefully indoctrinated, constantly told that sacrificing themselves was\na great privilege.\nThis, in the end, was what made Venli decide she needed to try to rebuild\nher people. The Fused and the humans … there was an equivalency to them.\nBoth sought to take away the minds of common folk. Both were interested\nsolely in the convenience of a useful body, without the accompanying\n“burden” of a personality, desires, and dreams.\nVenli was determined not to do the same. She would accept those who\ncame to her. If she wanted them to change, she would show them a better\nway. It was Timbre’s suggestion. Volition. Agency. Cardinal tenets of\nwhatever it was she was becoming.\nStrange sentiments for one who had once—with a grin on her face—\nbrought death and enslavement to her people. But so be it. She nodded to\nher friends, who backed away to watch the doors. Venli gestured for\nShumin to sit down with her at the small table by the wall, away from the\nwindows.\nBefore she spoke, Venli checked for spies. She drew a bit of Voidlight\nfrom a sphere in her pocket. She could use either of the two types of Light:\nthe strange Voidlight Odium provided, or the old Stormlight of Honor. From\nwhat Timbre said, this was new—whatever Venli was doing, it hadn’t been\ndone before.\nEshonai would have been excited by that idea, so Venli tried to take\nstrength from memories of her sister. Using that Light, she peeked into\nShadesmar: the Cognitive Realm. Timbre pulsed to Concern. They’d tested\nVenli’s other power—the ability to mold stone—only once, and it had\ndrawn secretspren.

A kind of specialized spren that flew through the city,\nwatching for signs of Knights Radiant using their powers.\nShe had escaped those secretspren without revealing herself, but it had\nbeen close. As long as the secretspren were near, Venli could not practice\nthe full extent of her abilities. Fortunately, this power—the one that let her\npeek into Shadesmar—did not draw the same attention.\nWith it, she saw a world overlapping the physical one. The second world\nwas made up of an ocean of beads, a strange sun set too far back in a black\nsky, and hovering lights. One for every soul. The souls of Fused were dark\nflames that pulsed like a beating heart. With care, she’d also learned to\njudge which spren a common singer had bonded to provide their form.\nSome Voidspren could hide from the eyes of all except those they\nwanted to see them—but none could hide from Venli, who could see their\ntraces in Shadesmar. She made certain none were nearby, and that Shumin\nwas not one of the mavset-im, Fused who could imitate the shapes of others.\nEven other Fused seemed wary of the mavset-im, Those Ones of Masks.\nShumin’s soul was as Venli expected: a common singer soul bonded to a\nsmall gravitationspren to take workform.\nVenli stopped using her powers. She knew she could travel to that\nstrange world if she wished—but Timbre warned that the place was\ndangerous for mortals, and it was difficult to return once fully there. Today,\nlooking was enough.\n“You must know what we are,” Venli said to Shumin. “And what we are\nnot. We do not seek to overthrow the Fused.”\n“But—”\n“We are not a rebellion,” Venli said. “We are a group of objectors who\ndo not like the choices we’ve been offered. Fused oppression or human\ntyranny? The god of hatred or the supposedly honorable god who\nabandoned us to slavery? We accept neither. We are the listeners. We will\ncast off everything—including our very forms if we must—to find freedom.\n“Once we have enough members, we will leave the city and travel\nsomeplace where no one will bother us. We will remain neutral in the\nconflicts between humans and Fused. Our only goal is to find a place where\nwe can thrive on our own. Our society. Our government. Our rules.”\n“But…” Shumin said. “They’re not simply going to let us walk away,\nright? What safe place is there away from everyone else?”\nThey were good questions. Venli hummed to Annoyance—at herself, not\nat Shumin. When her ancestors had first broken away in an ultimate act of\nbravery and sacrifice, it had been at the end of the wars between humans\nand singers. The listeners were able to escape in the confusion, a loose\nthread no one thought to tie up.\nThis was different. She knew it was.\nShe leaned forward. “We have two current plans. The first is to find\nsympathetic Fused and convince them we deserve this privilege. They\nrespect Passion and courage.”\n“Yeah, sure, but…” Shumin shrugged in a human way. So casual."

So casual.\n“There’s a big difference between respecting Passion and letting someone\ncurse you out. The Fused seem pretty intolerant of people truly disagreeing\nwith them.”\n“You’re making a mistake,” Venli said to Reprimand. “You assume the\nFused are all of a single mind.”\n“They’re the immortal servants of a terrible god.”\n“And they’re still people. Each with different hearts, thoughts, and goals.\nI retain hope that some of them will see what we’re planning as worthy.”\nIt was a frail hope, Venli admitted to herself. Timbre pulsed within her,\nagreeing. Leshwi though … the high lady seemed to respect her enemies.\nShe could be brutal, she could be unforgiving, but she could also be\nthoughtful.\nLeshwi said the conquest of Roshar was being undertaken on behalf of\nthe common singer people. Perhaps using similar language, Venli could\npresent her plan for a new listener homeland.\nUnfortunately, she feared that the Fused had fought their wars so long\nthat—despite paying lip service to giving the world back to the singers—\nthey no longer saw freedom as the goal. To many of them, the war was for\nvengeance: the destruction of their enemies, finally proving which side was\nright. So if Leshwi—who was among both the most sane and the most\nempathetic of Fused—could not be persuaded, then that left only one\noption. To run and hide. Venli’s ancestors had shown that courage. She was\nuncertain, when being honest with herself, whether she had the same moral\nstrength.\nShumin idly played with her hair rather than humming to an emotion as\na listener would have. Was that hair-twisting a sign she was bored, perhaps\nthe human way of humming to Skepticism?\n“If we must run,” Venli said, “we are not without resources.”\n“Forgive me if I’m hesitant, Brightness,” Shumin said. “They summoned\nrock monsters that were taller than the storming city wall. They have Regals\nand Fused. I think our sole hope is to get the entire city to turn against\nthem.”\n“We have a Regal as well,” Venli said, gesturing to herself. “There is a\nVoidspren in my gemheart, Shumin, but I have learned to contain and\nimprison it. It gives me powers, such as the ability to look into Shadesmar\nand see if any spren are nearby spying on us.”\n“Regal powers…” Shumin said, glancing to the others in the room.\n“And … I could have them too? Without surrendering my will to Odium?”\n“Possibly,” Venli said. “Once I have perfected the process so others can\nuse it.”\nTimbre pulsed inside her, disapproving. The little spren wanted Venli to\ntell the full truth—that she was Radiant. However, the time wasn’t right.\nVenli wanted to be certain she could offer others what she had before\nexposing what she was. She needed to be certain other spren like Timbre\nwere willing, and she needed to prepare her friends for the path."

She needed to be certain other spren like Timbre\nwere willing, and she needed to prepare her friends for the path.\n“Long ago,” Venli explained to Shumin, “the singers were allies of the\nspren. Then humans came, and the wars started. The events of those days\nare lost to all but the Fused—in the end, however, we know the spren chose\nhumans.\n“Eventually, the humans betrayed them. Killed them. Some spren have\nchosen to give humans a second chance, but others … Well, I have been\ncontacted by a spren who represents an entire people in Shadesmar. They\nrealize that perhaps we deserve a second chance more than humans do.”\n“What does that mean?” Shumin asked.\n“That we will not be completely without allies, once we make our\nmove,” Venli said. “Our ultimate goal is to find a place where we can\nescape other people’s rules and their laws. A place where we can be what\nwe wish and cast off the roles forced upon us.”\n“I’m in,” Shumin said. “That sounds like a storming delight, Brightness.\nMaybe … maybe if we have forms of power that aren’t granted by Odium,\nthe enemy will leave us alone.”\nEither that or Odium would see that his minions scoured Venli and her\nfaction from the planet.\nTimbre pulsed, saying no great work could be accomplished without\nrisk. Venli hated when she said things like that. It reminded her exactly how\ndangerous her current actions were. She drew in a little Light to check\nShadesmar again. She saw nothing spying on her, so—\nA dark, pulsing flame was moving down from above.\nLeshwi.\nVenli leaped to her feet, her chair slamming to the ground. Dul and\nMazish noticed her urgency and stood upright, searching around, trying to\ndecide what to do.\n“Open the shades!” Venli said. “Quickly! So she doesn’t see anything\nodd!”\nThey slammed the windows open right as the hatch rattled. Lady Leshwi\n—brilliant in her outfit of gold and black—entered, skimming above the\nsteps. She almost never came down here. What was going on?\nTimbre trembled inside Venli. They’d been discovered. It had to mean\nthey’d—\n“Gather yourself, Last Listener,” Leshwi said to the Rhythm of Agony.\n“Something is happening. Something dangerous.

There\nwere a hundred of them together, mostly squires of the various Windrunners\nwho had once been his team.\nKaladin didn’t have many squires left—none, unless you counted\nDabbid and Rlain. Rock didn’t have a spren either, but he … had moved on\nto something else. Kaladin wasn’t sure what it was, but he didn’t call\nhimself a squire.\nRlain would soon have a spren, and would finally be able to move on\ntoo. Dabbid had gone on the mission today to help Renarin deliver water\nand supplies to the townspeople. He’d never recovered from his battle\nshock, however, and didn’t have Radiant powers. He wasn’t so much a\nsquire as someone Kaladin and the others looked after.\nThe rest had all ascended to at least the Second Ideal. That made them\nmore than a squire, but not yet a full Radiant—having bonded a spren, but\nnot yet having earned a Blade. They were all so jovial as they walked\ntogether across the Oathgate plateau, and Kaladin didn’t begrudge them\ntheir mirth. They were dear to him, and he wanted them to laugh.\nYet at the moment, he couldn’t imagine anything more painful than the\nway they all tried to cheer him up. They sensed his mood, though he hadn’t\nspoken to them regarding his … relegation? His retirement?\nStorms. It made him sick to think about it.\nAs they walked, Lopen told him a particularly bad joke. Skar asked him\nfor a sparring session—which was his way of offering help. Normally\nKaladin would have agreed. But today … sparring would remind him of\nwhat he’d lost.\nSigzil, showing admirable restraint, told him that battle reports could\nwait until tomorrow. Storms. How bad did he look? Kaladin did his best to\ndeflect them all, pasting on a smile so wide it felt like it cracked his skin.\nRock kept his distance, carefully ignoring Kaladin. Rock generally did\nhave a better sense of his true mood than most. And Rock could see Syl,\nwho—fretful as she buzzed around Kaladin—eventually zipped off. She\ncaught a current nearby, flying into the air. She found flight as reassuring as\nhe did.\nI need to be careful not to let this break her, he thought. Keep up a strong\nfront for her, for all of them. They shouldn’t have to be in pain because of\nhow I feel. He could do this gracefully. He could fight this one last battle.\nThey crossed the open field of stone before the tower city. Kaladin\nalmost managed to keep walking without staring up at the tower. He nearly\ndidn’t feel a shock of dissociation at its immensity. He spent only a split\nsecond in disbelief that something so grand could exist. Yes, these days the\ntower was practically mundane.\n“Hey,” Leyten said as they reached the tower entrance. “Rock! Got any\nstew for us maybe? For old times’ sake?”\nKaladin turned. The word “stew” pierced the cloud.\n“Ah, coming up to the beautifully thin air makes you suddenly think"

The word “stew” pierced the cloud.\n“Ah, coming up to the beautifully thin air makes you suddenly think\nstraight!” Rock said. “You remember the glories of good cooking! But …\nthis thing cannot be today. I have appointment.”\n“It’s not with the surgeons, is it?” Kara called. “Because I don’t think\nthey can do anything about your breath, Rock!”\n“Ha!” Rock said, then bellowed a laugh, going so far as to wipe a tear\nfrom his eye. Kara grinned, but then Rock held out his hand. “No no, you\nthink I am laughing at what you said? Airsick! I’m laughing because you\nthought that to be funny joke, Kara. Ha! Ha!”\nKaladin smiled. A real smile, for a moment.\nThen they started to break apart into small clusters, usually a Knight\nwith their squad of squires. His friends all had their own teams now. Even\nTeft was pulled away by one of the groups, though his squires had been in\nBridge Thirteen—and they had stayed behind to guard the ship. In fact,\nmany of them had become Radiants themselves. Kaladin wasn’t certain\nhow many squires Teft had left.\nCould Kaladin do as Dalinar wanted? Could he stand being highmarshal\nof the Windrunners without going into the field? Being a part of their lives,\nbut not being able to help them, fight alongside them?\nNo. A clean break would be better.\nA few groups invited him to go with them, but he found himself turning\nthem down. He stood tall, like a commander should, and gave them the nod.\nThe captain’s nod that said, “You run along, soldier. I have important things\nto be about, and cannot be bothered with frivolity.”\nNobody pushed him, though he wished that one of them would. But\nthese days, they had their own lives. Many had families; all had duties.\nThose who had served with him in the early days still wore their Bridge\nFour patches with pride, but Bridge Four was something they used to\nbelong to. A legendary team already passed into myth.\nKaladin kept his back straight, his chin high, as he left them and strode\nthrough the now-familiar corridors of the tower city. Lined with entrancing\npatterns of different shades of strata, the tower had sphere lanterns lining\nmost major hallways—locked, of course, but changed regularly. The place\nwas starting to feel truly lived in. He passed families, workers, and\nrefugees. People of all walks, as varied as a goblet full of spheres.\nThey saluted him, or stepped aside for him, or—in the case of many\nchildren—waved to him. The highmarshal. Kaladin Stormblessed. He kept\non the proper face all the way to his rooms, and was proud of himself for it.\nThen he stepped inside and found an empty nothingness.\nHis were the quarters of a highlord, supposedly luxurious and spacious.\nHe had little furniture though, and that left it feeling hollow. Dark, the sole\nlight coming from the balcony.\nEvery honor he’d been given seemed to highlight how vacant his life\nreally was. Titles couldn’t fill a room with life.

He tried to unbutton his coat, but\nended up bending forward with his knuckles pressing his forehead, digging\ninto his skin as he hyperventilated, gasping in deep breaths of air while he\ntrembled and shook. Exhaustionspren like jets of dust gleefully congregated\naround him. And agonyspren, like upside-down faces carved from stone,\ntwisted and faded in and out.\nHe couldn’t cry. Nothing came out. He wanted to cry, because at least\nthat would be a release. Instead he huddled, knuckles pressing against the\nscars in his forehead, wishing he could shrivel away. Like the eyes of a\nperson struck by a Shardblade.\nIn moments like this—alone and huddled on the floor of a dark room,\ntormented by agonyspren—Moash’s words found him. The truth of them\nbecame undeniable. Out in the garish sunlight, it was easy to pretend that\neverything was all right. In here, Kaladin could see clearly.\nYou’re just going to keep hurting.…\nHis entire life had been a futile effort to stop a storm by yelling at it. The\nstorm didn’t care.\nThey’re all going to die. There’s nothing you can do about it.\nYou could never build anything that lasted, so why try? Everything\ndecayed and fell apart. Nothing was permanent. Not even love.\nOnly one way out …\nA knock came at his door. Kaladin ignored the sound until it became\ninsistent. Storms. They were going to barge in, weren’t they? Suddenly\npanicked that anyone should find him like this, Kaladin stood up and\nstraightened his coat. He took a deep breath, and the agonyspren faded.\nAdolin pushed his way in, a treasonous Syl on his shoulder. That was\nwhere she had gone? To fetch Adolin storming Kholin?\nThe young man wore a uniform of Kholin blue, but not a regulation one.\nHe’d taken to having embellishments added, regardless of what his father\nthought. While it was sturdy—a little stiff, starched to maintain neat lines—\nits sleeves were embroidered to match his boots. The cut left the coat longer\nthan most—a bit like Kaladin’s own captain’s coat, but more trendy.\nSomehow Adolin wore the uniform, when the uniform had always worn\nKaladin. To Kaladin, the uniform was a tool. To Adolin it was a part of an\nensemble. How did he get his hair—blond, peppered black—so perfectly\nmessy? It was both casual and deliberate at the same time.\nHe was smiling, of course. Storming man.\n“You are here!” Adolin said. “Rock said he thought you were heading\nfor your room.”\n“Because I wanted to be alone,” Kaladin said.\n“You spend too many evenings alone, bridgeboy,” Adolin said, glancing\nat the nearby exhaustionspren, then grabbing Kaladin by the arm—\nsomething few other people would have dared."

Sounds awful. Today, you’re coming with me. No more excuses.\nI let you blow me away last week and the week before.”\n“Maybe,” Kaladin snapped, “I just don’t want to be around you,\nAdolin.”\nThe highprince hesitated, then leaned forward, narrowing his eyes and\nputting his face up close to Kaladin’s. Syl still sat on Adolin’s shoulder, her\narms folded—without even the decency to look ashamed when Kaladin\nglared at her.\n“Tell me honestly,” Adolin said. “With an oath, Kaladin. Tell me that you\nshould be left alone tonight. Swear it to me.”\nAdolin held his gaze. Kaladin tried to form the words, and felt of the ten\nfools when he couldn’t get them out.\nHe definitely shouldn’t be alone right now.\n“Storm you,” Kaladin said.\n“Ha,” Adolin said, tugging him by the arm. “Come on, Brightlord Master\nHighmarshal Stormface. Change your coat to one that doesn’t smell like\nsmoke, then come with me. You don’t have to smile. You don’t have to talk.\nBut if you’re going to be miserable, you might as well do it with friends.”\nKaladin extracted his arm from Adolin’s grip, but didn’t resist further.\nHe grabbed new clothes—tossing aside the ones he’d been fighting in. He\ndid, however, shoot Syl another glare as she flew over to him.\n“Adolin?” Kaladin said as he changed. “Your first thought was to get\nAdolin?”\n“I needed someone you couldn’t intimidate,” she replied. “That list at\nbest includes three people. And the queen was likely to transform you into a\ncrystal goblet or something.”\nKaladin sighed and walked out to join Adolin, lest the highprince think\nhe was dallying. Syl eyed Kaladin as she walked in the air alongside him,\nkeeping up with him despite her dainty steps.\n“Thank you,” Kaladin said softly, turning his eyes forward.\n* * *\nAdolin made good on his promise. He didn’t force Kaladin to say much.\nTogether they made their way to the Ten Rings, a section of the tower’s\ncentral market where the merchants had agreed to lay their shops out\naccording to Navani’s plan. In exchange they got a deal on taxes and knew\nguard patrols would be frequent and courteous.\nRows of wooden storefronts here made neat, orderly streets. The shops\nwere of similar sizes and dimensions, with storage and housing on top. The\nplace felt quaint, an island of order contrasting the more organic, chaotic\nfeeling of the rest of the Breakaway market—where after a year, many\npeople still used tents instead of permanent structures.\nAdmittedly, it did feel strange to have rows of permanent structures built\nin the middle of a several-stories-high interior room. The oddest part to\nKaladin was that the most upscale shops—catering to the richest of the\nlighteyed families—had refused Navani’s invitation exactly as the seedier"

        "text": "Kaladin was that the most upscale shops—catering to the richest of the\nlighteyed families—had refused Navani’s invitation exactly as the seedier\nshops had. Neither wanted to agree to her oversight. The rich shops were all\noutside the market, in a series of rooms along a hallway nearby.\nThe upshot was that while the Ten Rings wasn’t terribly upscale, it was\nreputable—two concepts that weren’t necessarily the same thing. Adolin’s\nfavorite winehouse was called Jez’s Duty. He’d forced Kaladin to join him\nthere on more than one occasion, and so the interior was familiar. Themed\nafter a stormshelter—though no such thing was needed here in the tower—\nit had fabrial clocks on the walls that listed when a storm was happening in\nAlethkar, and held a daily vigil for the kingdom. An ardent even visited and\nburned glyphwards.\nBarring that, it could be a raucous place—more of a tavern than a\nwinehouse. Adolin had a reserved booth at the rear. It was a mark of pride\nthat the highprince frequented this location rather than more upscale\nwinehouses.\nThat was the sort of thing Adolin did. Nobody bowed when he entered;\ninstead they cheered and raised cups. Adolin Kholin wasn’t some distant\nbrightlord or general who sat in his keep and pronounced edicts, tyrannical\nor wise. He was the type of general who drank with his men and learned the\nnames of every soldier.\nDalinar disapproved. In most cases Kaladin would have as well. But …\nthis was Adolin. He’d have gone mad if he’d been forced to remain aloof. It\nwent against every traditional Alethi protocol of leadership, but Adolin\nmade it work. So who was Kaladin to judge?\nAs Adolin went to greet people, Kaladin made his way around the\nperimeter of the room, noting the larger-than-usual crowd. Was that Rock\nover there with his family, drinking mugs of Horneater mudbeer?\nHe said he had an appointment tonight, Kaladin remembered. Indeed,\nsome kind of celebration seemed to be going on. A few other Windrunners\nand Radiants he knew were in attendance, though not many. Mostly it\nseemed to be common folk. Perhaps a higher than normal percentage of\nsoldiers.\nSyl took off to begin poking through the room, looking at each table.\nThough he’d once seen her fascination as childlike, he’d evolved on that\nidea. She was just curious, desirous to learn. If that was childlike, then\neveryone needed more of it.\nShe was fascinated by human beings. In a room like this one, Kaladin\nwould often find her standing on a crowded table—unseen by the occupants\n—head cocked as she tried to imitate the mannerisms or expressions of one\nperson or another.\nAdolin’s booth was occupied by a young woman with long dark hair\nwearing trousers and a buttoned shirt, her long white coat hung on the peg\nnearby. She had her hat on, the wide-brimmed one with the peaked front.\n“Veil,” Kaladin said, sliding into the booth. “We going to have you all\nnight, or will Shallan show up?”\n“Probably just me,” Veil said, tipping back her cup to reach the last of"

        "text": "“Veil,” Kaladin said, sliding into the booth. “We going to have you all\nnight, or will Shallan show up?”\n“Probably just me,” Veil said, tipping back her cup to reach the last of\nher drink. “Shallan had a busy day, and we’re on Shattered Plains time, not\nUrithiru time. She wants a rest.”\nIt must be nice, Kaladin thought, to be able to retreat and become\nsomeone else when you get tired.\nIt was sometimes difficult to treat Shallan’s personas as three distinct\npeople, but it was what she seemed to prefer. Fortunately, she tended to\nchange her hair color to give the rest of them cues. Black for Veil, and she’d\nstarted using blonde for Radiant.\nA young barmaid came by, refilling Veil’s cup with something deep red.\n“And you?” the serving girl asked Kaladin.\n“Orange,” he said softly. “Chilled, if you have it.”\n“Orange?” the girl said. “A man like you can stomach something\nstronger. It’s a party! We’ve got a nice yellow infused with peca, an Azish\nfruit. I’ll—”\n“Hey,” Veil said, putting her boots on the table with a thump. “The man\nsaid orange.”\n“I just thought—”\n“Bring him what he asked for. That’s all you need to think about.”\nFlustered, the girl scampered off. Kaladin nodded to Veil in thanks,\nthough he wished people wouldn’t stick up for him quite so zealously. He\ncould speak for himself. As long as Dalinar followed the strictest\ninterpretation of the Codes of War, so would Kaladin. And barring that …\nwell, his friends knew. When Kaladin was in one of his moods, alcohol—\nfor all that it seemed it would help him forget his pain—always made the\ndarkness worse. He could use Stormlight to burn off the effects, but once he\nhad a drink or two in him, he often … didn’t want to. Or felt he didn’t\ndeserve to. Same difference.\n“So,” Veil said. “I hear your mission went well? An entire town stolen\nright out from underneath their storming noses? The Mink himself rescued?\nHeads will roll in Kholinar when Odium hears about this.”\n“I doubt he cares much about one town,” Kaladin said. “And they don’t\nknow we got the Mink.”\n“Regardless,” Veil said, lifting her cup to him.\n“And you?” Kaladin asked.\nShe leaned forward, taking her boots off the table. “You should have\nseen it. Ialai was basically a skeleton, withered away. We’d defeated her\nbefore we arrived. But it sure was satisfying to bring her down.”\n“I’m sure.”\n“Pity someone murdered her,” Veil said. “I’d have enjoyed watching her\nsquirm before Dalinar.”\n“Murdered her?” Kaladin said. “What?”\n“Yeah, someone offed her. One of our people, unfortunately. They must\nhave been bribed by someone who wanted to see her dead. That’s a secret,\nby the way. We’re telling everyone she killed herself.”\nKaladin glanced around.\n“Nobody will hear in here,” Veil said. “Our booth is isolated.”"

Don’t discuss military secrets in public.”\nVeil rolled her eyes, but then she shook her head, and her hair blended to\nblonde and she sat up straighter. “Do get a full report from Dalinar later,\nKaladin. There are oddities about the event that trouble me.”\n“I…” Kaladin said. “We’ll see. You share Veil’s opinion that Shallan is\nfine? She merely needs a rest?”\n“She is well enough,” Radiant said. “We’ve found a balance. A year now,\nwithout any new personas forming. Except…”\nKaladin raised an eyebrow.\n“There are some, half-formed,” Radiant said, turning away. “They wait,\nto see if the Three really can work. Or if it could crumble, letting them out.\nThey aren’t real. Not as real as I am. And yet. And yet…” She met\nKaladin’s eyes. “Shallan wouldn’t wish me to share that much. But as her\nfriend, you should know.”\n“I’m not sure if I can help,” Kaladin said. “I can barely keep a handle on\nmy own problems these days.”\n“You being here helps,” Radiant said.\nDid it? When Kaladin was in moods like this, he felt that he would bring\nonly darkness to those around him. Why would they want to be with him?\nHe wouldn’t want to be with him. But he supposed this was the sort of thing\nRadiant had to say; it was what made her distinct from the others.\nShe smiled as Adolin returned, then shook her head, hair bleeding to\nblack. She leaned back, relaxed. How nice it must be to transform into Veil,\nwith her laid-back attitude.\nAs Adolin was settling down, the barmaid returned with Kaladin’s drink.\n“If you decide you want to try that yellow…” she said to Kaladin.\n“Thanks, Mel,” Adolin said quickly. “But he doesn’t need anything to\ndrink today.”\nThe barmaid gave him a radiant smile—married man or not, they still\ntreated him that way—and floated off, seeming encouraged by the fact that\nthe highprince had spoken to her. Although he’d basically given her a\nreprimand.\n“How’s the groom?” Veil asked, getting out her dagger and balancing it\non the end of her fingertip.\n“Befuddled,” Adolin said.\n“Groom?” Kaladin asked.\n“Wedding party?” Adolin said, waving toward the room of festive\npeople. “For Jor?”\n“Who?” Kaladin asked.\n“Kaladin,” Adolin said, “we’ve been coming to this place for eight\nmonths.”\n“Don’t bother, Adolin,” Veil said. “Kaladin doesn’t notice people unless\nthey’ve pulled a weapon on him.”\n“He notices,” Adolin said. “He cares. But Kaladin’s a soldier—and he\nthinks like one. Right, bridgeboy?”\n“I have no idea what you mean,” Kaladin grumbled, sipping his drink.\n“You’ve learned to worry about your squad,” Adolin said. “And to cut\nout extraneous information.

I’ll bet Kaladin could tell you the age, eye\ncolor, and favorite food of everyone serving beneath him. But he’s not\ngoing to bother with remembering the names of the bar staff. Father’s the\nsame way.”\n“Well,” Veil said, “this is real fun and everything, but shouldn’t we be\nmoving on to a more important topic?”\n“Such as?” Adolin asked.\n“Such as who we’re going to fix Kaladin up with next.”\nKaladin about spat out his drink. “He doesn’t need fixing up with\nanyone.”\n“That’s not what Syl says,” Veil replied.\n“Syl used to think human children came out through the nose in a\nparticularly violent sneeze,” Kaladin said. “She is not an authority on this\ntopic.”\n“Mmm,” their table said, vibrating with a soft buzzing sound. “How do\nthey come out? I’ve always wondered.”\nKaladin started, only now realizing that Pattern dimpled part of the\nwooden tabletop. Pattern didn’t go about invisibly as Syl did, but somehow\ninfused the material of objects nearby. If you focused on him now, you’d\nsee a section of the tabletop that seemed to be carved into a circular pattern\n—one that somehow moved and flowed, like ripples in a cistern.\n“I’ll explain babies later, Pattern,” Veil said. “It’s more complicated than\nyou’re probably imagining. Wait … no. Ask Shallan to explain. She’ll love\nthat.”\n“Mmm,” the table said. “She changes colors. Like a sunset. Or an\ninfected wound. Mmm.”\nAdolin relaxed, resting his arm along the back of the bar seat—but not\nputting it around Veil. The two of them had a weird relationship when\nShallan was wearing Radiant or Veil. At least they seemed to have mostly\ngotten over the part where they acted like lovesick fools all the time.\n“The ladies have a point, bridgeboy,” Adolin said to him. “You have\nbeen extra sulky since Lyn broke up with you.”\n“This isn’t about that.”\n“Still, a fling couldn’t hurt, right?” Veil said. She nodded her chin toward\none of the passing barmaids, a tall young woman with unusually light hair.\n“What about Hem over there? She’s tall.”\n“Great. Tall,” Kaladin said. “Because we both measure roughly the same\nin inches, we’re sure to get along. Think of all the tall-person topics of\nconversation we could engage in. Like … Hmm…”\n“Oh, don’t be sour,” Veil said, smacking him on the shoulder. “You\ndidn’t even glance at her. She’s cute. Look at those legs. Back me up,\nAdolin.”\n“She’s attractive,” he said. “But that blouse is terrible on her. I need to\ntell Marni that the house uniforms here are dreadful. They should at least\nhave two different shades to match different skin tones.”\n“What about Ka’s sister,” Veil said to Kaladin. “You’ve met her, right?\nShe’s smart. You like smart girls.”\n“Is there really anyone who doesn’t like smart girls?” Kaladin said."

You like smart girls.”\n“Is there really anyone who doesn’t like smart girls?” Kaladin said.\n“Me,” Veil said, raising her hand. “Give me dumb ones, please. They’re\nso easy to impress.”\n“Smart girls…” Adolin said, rubbing his chin. “It’s too bad Skar\nsnatched up Ristina. They’d have been a good match.”\n“Adolin,” Veil said, “Ristina is like three feet tall.”\n“So?” Adolin said. “You heard Kaladin. He doesn’t care about height.”\n“Yeah, well, most women do. You’ve got to find someone who matches\nhim. Too bad he screwed up his chance with Lyn.”\n“I didn’t…” Kaladin protested.\n“What about her,” Adolin said, pointing as someone new entered the\ntavern. A couple of lighteyed women in havahs, though they probably\nweren’t of high rank if they were visiting a winehouse frequented by\ndarkeyes. Then again, Adolin was here. And things like nahn and rank had\nbeen … strangely less divisive this last year, under Jasnah’s rule.\nOne of the two newcomers was a younger woman with a luscious figure,\naccentuated by the tight havah. She had dark skin and red lips, clearly\nbrightened with lip paint.\n“Dakhnah,” Adolin said. “She’s the daughter of one of Father’s generals,\nKal. She loves talking strategy—she’s acted as scribe in his war meetings\nsince she was fourteen. I can introduce you.”\n“Please don’t,” Kaladin said.\n“Dakhnah…” Veil said. “You courted her, didn’t you?”\n“Yeah. How’d you know?”\n“Adolin dear, swing a Herdazian in a crowded room, and you’ll hit six\nwomen you courted.” She narrowed her eyes at the newcomer. “Those\naren’t real, are they? She pads, right?”\nAdolin shook his head.\n“Seriously?” Veil said. “Stormfather. To get mine that big I’d have to eat\nsix chulls. How do they feel?”\n“You’re making assumptions,” Adolin said.\nShe glared at him, then poked him in the shoulder. “Come on.”\nHe turned eyes toward the ceiling and pointedly took a drink, though he\nsmiled as she poked him again. “This is not a topic for gentlemen to\ndiscuss,” he said with an airy tone.\n“I’m neither gentle nor a man,” Veil said. “I’m your wife.”\n“You’re not my wife.”\n“I share a body with your wife. Close enough.”\n“You two,” Kaladin said, “have the strangest relationship.”\nAdolin gave him a slow nod that seemed to say, You have no idea. Veil\ndowned the rest of her drink, then upended the empty cup. “Where’s that\nstorming barmaid?”\n“You sure you haven’t had enough?” Adolin asked.\n“Am I sitting up straight?”\n“A vague approximation.”\n“There’s your answer,” she said—sliding out of the booth by moving\nover him in a maneuver that involved a lot of her touching a lot of him—\nthen went picking through the crowd for the barmaid."

The few times we managed to meet, Shallan was practically\ncrawling up the walls with tension. This is her way of letting loose.”\nWell, if it worked for them … “Is Ialai Sadeas really dead?”\n“Unfortunately. Father already has armies moving to the warcamps.\nInitial reports say her men have offered articles of surrender; they must\nhave known this was coming.…” He shrugged. “Still makes me feel like I\nfailed.”\n“You had to do something. That group was getting too powerful, too\ndangerous, to leave alone.”\n“I know. But I hate the idea of fighting our own. We’re supposed to be\nmoving on to better things. Greater things.”\nSays the man who killed Sadeas, Kaladin thought. That wasn’t common\nknowledge yet, so he didn’t speak it out loud in case someone was listening.\nTheir conversation lapsed. Kaladin played with his cup, wishing for a\nrefill, though he wasn’t about to go fighting through the crowd to find one.\nPeople were taking turns cheering for Jor—and as the groom himself passed\nby, Kaladin realized he did recognize the man. He was the house bouncer,\nan affable fellow. Syl was riding on his shoulder.\nVeil’s quest ran long. Kaladin thought he spotted her over at one corner,\nplaying a game of breakneck for chips. He was surprised there was anyone\nleft in the city who would still play against Veil.\nEventually, Adolin scooted a little closer. He had his own drink, an\nintoxicating violet—but he’d barely made his way through half the cup. He\nno longer strictly followed the Codes, but he seemed to have found his own\nbalance.\n“So,” Adolin said, “what’s going on? This is more than just what\nhappened with Lyn.”\n“I thought you said I didn’t have to talk.”\n“You don’t.” Adolin took a sip, waiting.\nKaladin stared at the table. Shallan often carved parts of it, so the wood\nhere was etched with small but intricate art projects—many of them half\nfinished. He ran his finger across one that depicted an axehound and a man\nwho looked remarkably like Adolin.\n“Your father relieved me of active duty today,” Kaladin said. “He thinks\nI’m … I’m not fit to see battle any longer.”\nAdolin let out a long exhalation. “That storming man…”\n“He’s right, Adolin,” Kaladin said. “Remember how you had to pull me\nout of the palace last year.”\n“Everyone gets overwhelmed in a fight sometimes,” Adolin said. “I’ve\ngotten disoriented before, even in Shardplate.”\n“This is worse. And more frequent. I’m a surgeon, Adolin. I’ve trained to\nspot problems like these, so I know he’s right. I’ve known for months.”"

He nodded curtly. “So it is. What are we going\nto do about it? How do you get better?”\n“You don’t. Dabbid, the guy in my crew? The one who doesn’t talk?\nBattle shock, like mine. He’s been like that since I recruited him.”\nAdolin fell silent. Kaladin could see him sort through potential\nresponses. Adolin was many things, but “hard to read” would never be one\nof them.\nFortunately, he didn’t make any of the expected comments. No simple\naffirmations, no encouragement for Kaladin to cheer up or soldier on. The\ntwo of them sat quietly in the loud room for a long pause. Then eventually,\nAdolin spoke. “My father can be wrong, you know.”\nKaladin shrugged.\n“He’s human,” Adolin said. “Half the city thinks he’s some kind of\nHerald reborn, but he’s only a man. He’s been wrong before. Terribly\nwrong.”\nDalinar killed Adolin’s mother, Kaladin thought. That news was out,\nspread wide. The city had all either read, listened to, or been told about\nDalinar’s strange autobiography. Handwritten by the Blackthorn himself, it\nwasn’t quite finished, but drafts had been shared. In it Dalinar confessed to\nmany things, including the accidental killing of his wife.\n“I’m not a surgeon,” Adolin said. “And I’m not half the general my\nfather is. But I don’t think you need to be removed from combat, at least not\npermanently. You need something else.”\n“Which is?”\n“Wish I knew. There should be a way to help you. A way to make it so\nyou can think straight.”\n“I wish it were that easy,” Kaladin said. “But why do you care? What\ndoes it matter?”\n“You’re my only bridgeboy,” Adolin said with a grin. “Where would I\nget another? They’ve all started flying away.” The grin faded. “Besides. If\nwe can find a way to help you, then maybe … maybe we can find a way to\nhelp her.” His gazed drifted across the room, toward Veil.\n“She’s fine,” Kaladin said. “She’s found a balance. You’ve heard her\nexplain how she thinks she’s fine now.”\n“Like how you tell everyone you’re fine?” Adolin met his eyes. “This\nisn’t right, how she is. It hurts her. Over this last year I’ve seen her\nstruggling, and I’ve seen hints that she’s sliding—if more slowly now—\ntoward worse depths. She needs help, the kind I don’t know if I can give\nher.”\nTheir table hummed. “You are right,” Pattern said. “She hides it, but\nthings are still wrong.”\n“What does your surgeon’s knowledge say, Kal?” Adolin said. “What do\nI do?”\n“I don’t know,” Kaladin said. “We are trained in dealing with physical\nailments, not in what to do when someone is sick in the mind, other than\nsend them to the ardents.”\n“Seems wrong.”"

He wasn’t totally certain what the\nardents did with mentally ill patients.\n“Should I talk to them?” Pattern asked. “Ardents, for help?”\n“Maybe,” Kaladin said. “Wit might know some way to help too. He\nseems to know about all kinds of things like this.”\n“Surely you can give some advice, Kal,” Adolin said.\n“Let her know you care,” Kaladin said. “Listen to her. Be encouraging,\nbut don’t try to force her to be happy. And don’t let her be alone, if you’re\nworried about her.…”\nHe trailed off, then shot Adolin a glare.\nAdolin smirked. This hadn’t just been about Shallan. Damnation. Had he\nlet Adolin outsmart him? Maybe he should get something stronger to drink.\n“I’m worried about you both,” Adolin said. “I’m going to find a way to\nhelp. Somehow.”\n“You’re a storming fool,” Kaladin said. “We need to get you a spren.\nWhy hasn’t an order picked you up yet?”\nAdolin shrugged. “I’m not a good fit, I guess.”\n“It’s that sword of yours,” Kaladin said. “Shardbearers do better if they\ndrop any old Shards. You need to get rid of yours.”\n“I’m not ‘getting rid’ of Maya.”\n“I know you’re attached to the sword,” Kaladin said. “But you’d have\nsomething better, if you became Radiant. Think about how it would feel to\n—”\n“I’m not getting rid of Maya,” Adolin said. “Leave it, bridgeboy.” The\nfinality in his voice surprised Kaladin, but before he could push further, Jor\nshowed up to introduce his new bride, Kryst, to Adolin.\nAnd, mark Kaladin as the fourth fool if Adolin didn’t immediately pull\nout a gift for the pair. Adolin hadn’t merely shown up at his favorite\nwinehouse on the night of a wedding party, he’d come ready with a present.\nVeil eventually tired of her game and found her way back, more than a\nlittle tipsy. When Adolin joked about it, she made a wisecrack about being\nlucky she was Veil, “because Shallan really can’t hold her alcohol.”\nAs the evening progressed, Syl returned to proclaim she wanted to take\nup gambling. Kaladin felt increasingly glad for what Adolin had done. Not\nbecause Kaladin felt better; he was still miserable. Yet the misery did lessen\naround others, and it required Kaladin to keep up a semblance. To pretend.\nIt might be a front, but he’d found that sometimes the front worked even on\nhimself.\nThe balance lasted for a good two hours, until—as the wedding party\nstarted to wane—Rock stepped up. He must have spoken to Adolin and Veil\nearlier, as they slipped out of the booth as soon as they noticed him, leaving\nRock and Kaladin to speak in private.\nThe look on Rock’s face made Kaladin’s stomach churn. So, the time\nhad arrived, had it? Of course it would happen today, of all days."

First\nShardbearer among my people was not nuatoma, but young woman.”\n“It could have been you, Rock,” Kaladin said. “Either with those Shards\nyou won, or as a Radiant with your own spren. We need you. I need you.”\n“You have had me. Now, I need me. It is time to return, my ula’makai.\nMy captain.”\n“You just said your traditions were foolish.”\n“To my daughter.” Rock pointed to his heart. “Not to me, Kaladin. I\nlifted the bow.”\n“You saved my life.”\n“I made that choice because you are worth that sacrifice.” He reached\nacross the table and rested his hand on Kaladin’s shoulder. “But it is no\nsacrifice unless I now go, as is right, to seek justice from my people. I\nwould leave with your blessing. But I will leave either way.”\n“Alone?”\n“Ha! I would not have anyone to talk to! Song will go with me, and\nyounger children. Cord and Gift, they wish to stay. Gift should not fight, but\nI fear he will. It is his choice. As this is my choice.”\n“Moash is out there, Rock. He might attack you. If you won’t fight …\nyour family could be in danger.”\nThis gave Rock pause, then he grinned. “Skar and Drehy both said they\nwanted to see my Peaks. Perhaps I will let them help fly my family, so we\ndo not have to walk all across stupid lowlands. Then we will have\nprotection, yes?”\nKaladin nodded. It was the best he could do—send an escort. Rock\nseemed to wait for something … and Kaladin realized it might be an offer\nto go with them. To see the Horneater Peaks that Rock had so often bragged\nabout. The large cook never could get his stories straight. Was the place a\nfrigid wasteland or a lush and warm paradise?\nIn any case … maybe Kaladin could go. Maybe he could fly off to\nadventure. Take Rock to his home, then stay—or simply run away, find a\nbattle somewhere. Dalinar couldn’t stop him.\nNo. Kaladin dismissed the thought immediately. Fleeing would be the\naction of a child. Plus, he couldn’t go with Rock. Not merely because of the\ntemptation to flee, but because he doubted he could hold back if Rock gave\nhimself up to justice.

The Horneater had been deliberately quiet about what\npunishment his people might impose as a consequence for his actions, but\nKaladin found their entire tradition of birth-order-based roles in life stupid.\nIf Kaladin went, it would be to undermine his friend’s decision.\n“I give my blessing, Rock,” Kaladin said. “Both to you going, and to any\nwho wish a short leave to accompany you. A Windrunner honor guard—you\ndeserve that and more. And if you do encounter Moash…”\n“Ha,” Rock said, standing. “He should try to come for me. That will let\nme get close enough to put hands on his neck and squeeze.”\n“You don’t fight.”\n“That? Is not fighting. Is exterminating.

        "text": "The morning after the wedding party, Shallan had to deal with Veil’s\nalcohol abuse. Again. Her head throbbed, and much of the late night was a\nblur in her mind. Storming woman.\nFortunately, with some Stormlight and some herbs for headaches, she\nwas feeling better by the time she finished meetings with her accountants\nand ministers. She was wife to a highprince, and though their lands in\nAlethkar were under enemy control, she and Adolin had a tenth of Urithiru\nto tend.\nConsidering Shallan’s Radiant duties, they’d put several trustworthy\nwomen in control of finances—their husbands overseeing police and\nguards. The meeting mostly involved Radiant dispensing a few decisions\nand Shallan auditing the accounts. She’d have more work to do in the\nfuture, but for now things were in hand. Adolin said she was supposed to be\ntaking some time off following the mission anyway.\nHe was using that time to go ride horses. Once the scribes withdrew\nfrom her audience chamber, Shallan found herself alone—and for the first\ntime in weeks, she didn’t have a role to play. She went through her letters\nand spanreed communications for a while, and eventually froze on a certain\none that had arrived a day before she returned.\nThe deal is set and arranged. The spren will come.\nShe held this one for a moment, then burned it. Feeling a chill, she\ndecided she didn’t want to be alone in her room any longer—so went to\nvisit her brothers.\nTheir quarters weren’t far from hers. Jushu was the only one there when\nshe arrived, but he let her in and chatted with her about her mission. Then,\nas usually happened when she visited, Shallan found her way to the room’s\nhearth to draw. It felt … natural. Visiting her brothers didn’t necessarily\nmean talking to them the entire time.\nShe nestled in the blankets beside the hearth, and for a blessed few\nminutes could imagine she was home in Jah Keved. In her fantasy, a fire\ncrackled in the hearth. Nearby, her stepmother and her father chatted\ntogether with some visiting ardents—men and women of the church, which\nmeant her father was being well-behaved.\nShallan was allowed her sketchbook, as Father loved to show off her\nskill. Eyes closed, she drew the hearth—each brick engraved in her mind\nfrom the many times she’d drawn here. Good days. Warm days.\n“Hey, what’re you drawing?” Jushu asked. “Is it the hearth from home?”\nShe smiled, and though the real Jushu had spoken, she incorporated him\ninto her mental image. One of her four older brothers—because in this\nmemory, she still had four. Jushu and Wikim were twins, though Jushu\nlaughed more than Wikim did. Wikim was thoughtful. And Balat, he would\nsit in the chair nearby, pretending to be confident. Helaran was back, and\nBalat always puffed up when the eldest Davar brother was around.\nShe opened her eyes and glanced at the little creationspren gathering\naround her, imitating mundane things.

One in particular made her feel cold. A\nnecklace chain slinking across the ground.\nIn truth, those days at home had been terrible times. Times of tears, and\nscreams, and a life unraveling. It was also the last time she could remember\nher entire family together.\nExcept … no, that wasn’t the entire family. This memory had happened\nafter … after Shallan had killed her mother.\nConfront it! she thought at herself, angry. Don’t ignore it! Pattern moved\nacross the floor of the room here in Urithiru, spinning among the dancing\ncreationspren.\nShe’d been only eleven years old. Seven years ago now—and if that\ntimeline was correct, she must have begun seeing Pattern as a young child.\nLong before Jasnah had first encountered her spren. Shallan didn’t\nremember her first experiences with Pattern. Other than the distinct image\nof summoning her Shardblade to protect herself as a child, she had excised\nall such memories.\nNo, they’re here, Veil thought. Deep within, Shallan.\nShe couldn’t see those memories; didn’t want to see them. As she shied\naway from them, something dark shifted inside her, growing stronger.\nFormless. Shallan didn’t want to be the person who had done those things.\nThat … that person could not … not be loved.…\nShe gripped her pencil in tight fingers, the drawing half-finished in her\nlap. She’d buckled down and forced herself to read studies on other people\nwith fragmented personas. She’d found only a handful of mentions in\nmedical texts, though the accounts implied people like her were treated as\nfreaks even by the ardents. Oddities to be locked away in the darkness for\ntheir own good, studied by academics who found the cases “novel in their\nbizarre nature” and “giving insight to the addled mind of the psychotic.” It\nwas clear that going to such experts with her problems was not an option.\nMemory loss was apparently common to these cases, but the rest of what\nShallan experienced seemed distinctly different. Importantly, she wasn’t\nexperiencing continued memory loss. So maybe she was fine. She’d\nstabilized.\nEverything was getting better. Surely it was.\n“Storms,” Jushu said. “Shallan, that’s some … some weird stuff you’ve\ndrawn.”\nShe focused on the sketch—which she’d drawn poorly, since her eyes\nhad been closed. It took her a second to notice that in the fireplace back\nhome, she’d drawn burning souls. One might have mistaken them for\nflamespren, but for the fact that they looked so similar to her and her three\nbrothers.…\nShe snapped the sketchbook closed. She wasn’t back in Jah Keved. The\nhearth before her now had no flames; it was a depression with a heating\nfabrial resting in it, set into the wall of a Urithiru room.\nShe had to live in the present.

They’d twice caught him trying to\nremove the heating fabrial.\nThe way he smiled at her was a lie. Or maybe he was simply trying the\nbest he could to remain upbeat. Almighty knew she understood that.\n“Nothing to say?” he asked. “No quip? You almost never make\nwisecracks anymore.”\n“You aren’t around enough for me to make sport of,” she said. “And no\none else is quite as inspiring in their incompetence.”\nHe smiled, but winced, and Shallan immediately felt ashamed. The joke\nwas too accurate. She couldn’t act like when they’d been kids; then, their\nfather had been a great unifying enemy, making their gallows humor a way\nto cope.\nShe worried about them drifting apart. So she visited, almost defiantly.\nJushu rose to get some food, and Shallan wanted to try another joke. She\nlet him go instead. With a sigh, she rummaged in her satchel and brought\nout Ialai’s little notebook. She was piecing some of its meanings together.\nFor instance, Ialai’s spies had caught members of the Ghostbloods talking\nabout a new route through the Sea of Lost Lights. That was the place she\nand the others had traveled in Shadesmar a year back. Indeed, an entire\nthree pages were filled with locations from the mysterious world of the\nspren.\nI saw a map, Ialai had written, in the things of the Ghostblood we\ncaptured—and should have thought to copy it, for it was lost in the fire.\nHere is what I remember.\nShallan made some notes at the bottom of Ialai’s crude map. Whatever\nskills in politics the woman had possessed, they had been offset by a dearth\nof artistic ability. But perhaps Shallan could find some actual maps of\nShadesmar and compare?\nThe door opened, admitting Balat and a friend returning from their duties\nas guardsmen, though Shallan’s back was to the group. From the quiet\nvoices, Eylita—Balat’s wife—had met them somewhere in the hallway, and\nwas laughing at something Balat said. Over the last year, Shallan had grown\nsurprisingly fond of the young woman. As a child, Shallan remembered\nbeing jealous of anyone who might take her brothers away—but as an adult,\nshe saw better. Eylita was kind and genuine. And it took a special person to\nlove a member of the Davar family.\nShallan continued her study of the book, listening with half an ear as\nBalat and Eylita chatted with their friend. Eylita had encouraged Balat to\nfind an occupation, though Shallan wasn’t certain becoming a guardsman\nwas the best match for him. Balat had a tendency to enjoy the pain of other\ncreatures a little too much.\nBalat, Eylita, and his friend made their way to the other room, where a\ncooling fabrial kept some meats and curries chilled for meals. Their life was\ngrowing so convenient, and it could be even more so. Shallan’s elevation to\nwife of a highprince could have awarded this home dozens of servants."

        "text": "growing so convenient, and it could be even more so. Shallan’s elevation to\nwife of a highprince could have awarded this home dozens of servants.\nHer brothers, however, had grown distrustful of servants—and they had\ngrown accustomed to living without in the lean days. Besides, these fabrials\ndid the work of a dozen people. No need for someone to chop or carry\nwood, no need for a fresh trip to the tower kitchens each day. Almost,\nShallan feared, Navani’s artifabrians would make them all lazy.\nAs if having servants hasn’t already made most lighteyes lazy, Shallan\nthought. Focus. Why are the Ghostbloods so interested in Shadesmar? Veil,\nany thoughts?\nVeil frowned, absently turned around to put her back to the wall, then\ntucked her foot through the strap of her satchel to prevent it from being\npulled away. When she became Veil, the colors in the room … muted. The\ncolors didn’t change, but her perception shifted. Shallan would have\ndescribed those strata lines as rust colored, but to Veil they were just red.\nVeil kept one eye on the door to the balcony. Balat, Eylita, and Jushu had\nall moved out there, and were joking with that other guardsman.\nLaughterspren moved in front of the door. Who was this friend? Shallan\nhadn’t bothered to check.\nSorry, Shallan thought. I was distracted.\nVeil studied the words in the notebook, picking out the relevant pieces.\nMaps, names of places, discussions of the cost of moving items through\nShadesmar. Shallan’s first mission for the Ghostbloods—back when Veil\nhad been no more than a drawing in a notebook—had been to spy on\nAmaram, who had been trying to work out how to find Urithiru and the\nOathgates.\nThe Oathgates—though primarily used to quickly move troops and\nsupplies—had another function. They had the ability to send people back\nand forth into Shadesmar, a usage that Dalinar’s scholars and Radiants had\nslowly managed to unlock during the past year. Was that what Mraize had\nwanted?\nVeil saw the pieces of something grand in Mraize’s moves: find the\nOathgates, attempt to secure unfettered—perhaps exclusive—access to\nShadesmar. Along the way, try to remove rivals, like Jasnah. Then recruit a\nRadiant who could look into Shadesmar. Finally, attack other factions who\nwere trying to discover the secrets.\nShe would have to … Wait. That voice.\nVeil’s head jolted up. The guard her brothers were talking to. Damnation.\nVeil snapped the book closed and tucked it in the pocket of her dress, then\nstood and had Shallan make her hair red again, though Veil kept control.\nShe peeked out onto the balcony to check, but she already knew she’d\nfind Mraize there.\nHe stood tall, with his peculiarly scarred face, wearing a gold and black\nuniform like Balat. Those were colors of the Sebarial Princedom—the\nhouse Shallan had chosen to align with before marrying into the Kholins.\nShe’d once seen Mraize in a similar uniform, serving Ialai and her house a\nyear ago."

Not that it was poorly tailored, he was\nsimply … wrong in it. He was at once too lofty and too jagged a person for\nthe job. Predatory, where a guardsman should be obedient—yet also refined,\nwhen being a guardsman was one of the more lowly jobs for a lighteyes.\nHe saw her, of course. Mraize always watched the doors; she’d learned\nthe trick from him. He didn’t break character, laughing at what Balat said,\nbut he didn’t fake nearly as well as Shallan could. He couldn’t keep the\nhaughty tone from his laugh, or the bite from his grin. He didn’t reside in\nthe character; he wore it as a costume.\nVeil folded her arms and lounged by the doorway. A cold breeze blew in\noff the mountains, making her shiver. Mraize and the boys pretended not to\nbe cold, though their breath puffed in front of them and coldspren grew like\nspikes on the balcony railing. Odd, how in this tower it could feel so much\nwarmer inside, even if you left the door open. Indeed, Eylita soon made an\nexcuse and went in, passing Veil with a smile and a wave, which Shallan\nreturned.\nVeil kept her attention on Mraize. He clearly wanted her to see him\ninteracting with her brothers. He rarely used overt threats, but this was a\nwarning. He had been the one to bring the young men here safely, a reward\nfor her services rendered. What he had given her, he could remove. As a\nguardsman, he’d train each day with the sword near Balat. Accidents\nhappened. Shallan panicked slightly at this discovery, but Veil could play\nthis game, even if the pieces were people she loved.\nWe need to be ready to make a move, Radiant thought, to put our\nbrothers where they will be safe.\nVeil agreed. Did such a place exist? Or instead should she gather a few\npieces of her own to use? She needed information—about the Ghostbloods,\nand about Mraize himself. Despite their time working together, she knew\nnext to nothing about the man.\nShe was curious to see how Mraize would create an opportunity for the\ntwo of them to speak together alone. It would be strange if he—supposedly\na lowly lighteyed soldier—were to request time with Shallan.\nAfter a short conversation, Mraize said, “I do admire your view here,\nBalat! I wish I merited a balcony room. Look at those mountains! Next time\nI walk the gardens below, I’ll glance up and see if I can find you.\nRegardless, for now I should be returning to my quarters.”\nHe pretended to see Shallan there for the first time, and hastily bowed to\nher. It was a fair effort, but overdone. She nodded to him as he retreated\nthrough their rooms and left. He’d want to meet her in the gardens, but she\ndidn’t intend to rush off to do his bidding.\n“Balat,” she said. “That man. Have you known him long?”"

Have you known him long?”\n“Hm? What was that, small one?” Balat turned toward her. During their\nfirst months together, talking to him had felt so awkward. Balat expected\nher to be the same timid girl who had left searching for Jasnah. Being with\nthem had made Shallan realize how different she’d become in their months\napart.\nIt had been a fight, strangely, not to backslide when around these three. It\nwasn’t that she wanted to be the younger, timid version of herself. But it\nwas familiar in ways these new versions of her were not.\n“That man,” Veil said. “What’s his name?”\n“We call him Gobby,” Balat said. “He’s old to be in training, but with the\ncall out for new soldiers, lots of people who haven’t really held a sword\nbefore are joining up.”\n“Is he good?” Veil asked.\n“Gobby? Nah. He’s fine, I mean, but makes a lot of mistakes. Almost\nchopped a man’s arm off by accident last week! Captain Talanan laid into\nhim for that one, I’ll tell you!” He chuckled, but Veil’s unamused face made\nhim trail off.\nShe became Shallan and smiled belatedly, but her brothers left to go eat.\nShe watched them chatting together and felt something stir inside her:\nregret. They’d found an equilibrium as a family, but she wasn’t certain\nshe’d ever get used to being the adult in the room when they were together.\nIt made her want to go bother Adolin. She thought she could pick him\nout below, riding Dalinar’s horse on the field they’d dedicated to the\nanimals. But she wouldn’t interrupt him—spending time with the\nRyshadium was one of the purest joys of Adolin’s life.\nBest to go attend Mraize, as he wanted.\n* * *\n“Garden” was too grand a term by far for the small field beneath the\nwindows to her brothers’ quarters. Yes, some of the Alethi gardeners had\nbegun growing shalebark ridges or other ornamental plants here—but the\ncold weather stunted growth. The result, even with the occasional use of a\nheating fabrial, was little more than a network of colored mounds on the\nground, not the gorgeous cultivated walls of a true garden. She picked out\nonly two small lifespren.\nMraize was a dark pillar on the far side, surveying the frosted mountain\npeaks. Veil didn’t try to sneak up on him; she knew he’d sense her coming.\nHe seemed to be able to do that no matter how little sound she made. It was\na trick she’d been trying to replicate.\nInstead she stepped up beside him. She’d fetched her hat and coat, the\nlatter buttoned against the cold, but she’d covered that and her face with the\nillusion of a guard in Sebarial’s army.

The few remaining\nmembers have fled into hiding, separately. With Dalinar’s soldiers\n‘restoring order’ in the warcamps, there is little chance of the infestation\nrestarting.”\n“One of your operatives killed Ialai,” Veil said, trying to pick out what\nMraize was looking at. He was staring intently, tracking something out\nthere. She saw only snow and slopes.\n“Yes,” Mraize said.\n“I don’t like the idea of someone watching over my shoulder,” Veil said.\n“It says you don’t trust me.”\n“Should I trust you three? I’m under the impression that at least part of\nyou isn’t … fully committed.”\nShe finally picked out what Mraize was watching: a small dot of color\nsoaring through one of the canyons. His pet chicken, the green one. Mraize\nwhistled sharply, and the sound echoed below. The creature turned in their\ndirection.\n“You must decide,” Mraize said to her, “how long you are going to\ncontinue this flirtation, Veil. You tease us. Are you a Ghostblood or not?\nYou enjoy the benefits of our organization, but refuse to get the tattoo.”\n“Why would I want something that could reveal me?”\n“Because of the commitment it represents. Because of the permanence.”\nHe eyed her, noting her illusion. “Of course, with your powers nothing is\npermanent, is it? You deal exclusively in the ephemeral.”\nHe held up his arm as the chicken returned, fluttering its wings as it\nlanded, its talons clutching his coat. The chicken was one of the strangest\nvarieties Veil had ever seen, with that large hooked beak and those bright\ngreen feathers. It carried something in its mouth, a small furry creature. It\ncould have been a rat, but the look was wrong.\n“What is that?” Veil asked. “What did it catch?”\n“A mole,” Mraize said.\n“A what?”\n“Like a rat, but different. You know the word, ‘mole’? An informant?\nComes from these creatures, which live in Shinovar and dig into places\nthey’re not wanted. They’ve made their way across Azir over the centuries,\nthen into the mountains.”\n“Whatever,” Veil said.\nThe scarred man eyed her, a hint of a smile on his lips. “Shallan will find\nthis interesting, Veil. Do you not want to ask, for her sake? An invasive\nspecies from Shinovar, slowly making a home in the mountains? Where\nRosharan creatures cannot live. They lack the fur, the adaptations, you see.”\nShallan emerged as he said it, so she took a Memory. She needed to draw\nthe little beast. How did it survive in this cold? Surely there wasn’t anything\nto eat up here.\n“A hunter knows the advantages his prey relies upon to hide and to\nthrive,” Mraize said. “Shallan understands this; she seeks to understand the\nworld. You should not dismiss this kind of knowledge so quickly, Veil. It\nhas applications you may not anticipate, but which will serve you both\nwell.”\nDamnation. Shallan hated talking with him.

She found herself wanting to\nnod, to agree with him, to learn from him. Radiant whispered truth: Shallan\nhad lived her childhood with a father who had been paternal in all the\nwrong ways and none of the right ones. In Mraize, a part of her saw a\nsubstitute. Strong, confident, and—most importantly—willing to offer\npraise.\nHis chicken held its prey with one foot, eating almost like a person did\nwith their hands. The thing was so strange, so alien. It stood upright, like no\nother beast Shallan had studied. When it chirped at Mraize, it sounded\nalmost like it was talking, and she swore she could occasionally make out\nwords. It was like a tiny parody of a person.\nShe glanced away from the brutal display of the feasting chicken, though\nMraize watched the creature with an air of approval.\n“I can’t join the Ghostbloods fully,” she said, “unless I know what it is\nyou’re trying to accomplish. I don’t know your motivations. How can I\nalign with you until I do?”\n“Surely you can guess,” Mraize said. “It’s about power, obviously.”\nShe frowned. So … was it really that simple? Had she imagined depths\nto this man that weren’t there?\nMraize continued to hold his chicken on one arm, fishing in his pocket\nwith the other hand. He took out a diamond broam, then handed it to her,\nwrapping her fingers around it. Her fist shone from within.\n“Power,” Mraize said. “Portable, easily contained, renewable. You hold\nthe energy of a storm in your hand, Veil. That raw energy, plucked from the\nheart of the raging tempest. It is tamed—not only a safe source of light, but\nof power that those with … particular interests and abilities can access.”\n“Sure,” Veil said, emerging again. “At the same time it’s practically\nworthless—because anyone can get it. The gemstones are the valuable\npart.”\n“That’s small thinking,” Mraize said. “The stones are but containers. No\nmore valuable than a cup. Important, yes, if you wish to carry liquid across\nthe dry expanse. But the value comes solely from what it contains.”\n“What kind of ‘dry expanse’ would you cross?” Veil asked. “I mean, you\ncan always simply wait for a storm.”\n“Locked into your conditioned way of thinking,” Mraize said, shaking\nhis head. “I thought you’d be able to see bigger, to dream bigger. Tell me,\nwhen you traveled Shadesmar, how valuable was a little Stormlight?”\n“Very,” she said. “So … this is about bringing Stormlight to Shadesmar?\nWhat do the spren have that you want?”\n“That, little knife, is the wrong question.”\nBlast.

She had Shallan bleed their hair to blonde, though\nthey were still wearing a man’s face, and folded her hands behind her back,\nstanding up straighter.\nAsk a better question. “Nalathis,” Radiant said. “Scadarial. What are\nthey?”\n“Nalthis. Scadrial.” He spoke the words with a different accent. “Where\nare they. That’s an excellent question, Radiant. Suffice it to say they are\nplaces in Shadesmar where our Stormlight—so easily captured and\ntransported—would be a valuable commodity.”\nCurious. She knew so little of Shadesmar, but the spren had vast cities—\nand she knew Stormlight was prized there. “That’s why you wanted to get\nto Urithiru before Jasnah. You knew the Oathgates would offer easy access\nto Shadesmar. You want to control commerce, travel, to these other places.”\n“Excellent,” Mraize said. “Trade to Roshar through Shadesmar has been\nhistorically difficult, as there is only one stable access point—one\ncontrolled by the Horneaters, who have been unpleasant to deal with. Yet\nRoshar has something that so many other peoples in the cosmere want: free,\nportable, easy-to-access power.”\n“There has to be more,” Radiant said. “What is the catch? The problem\nwith the system? You wouldn’t be telling me this if there weren’t a\nproblem.”\nHe glanced at her. “Excellent observation, Radiant. I find it unfortunate\nwe don’t normally get along.”\n“We would get along much better if you were more straightforward with\npeople,” Radiant said. “Your type turns my stomach.”\n“What?” Mraize asked. “Me? A simple guardsman?”\n“One who has a reputation for being clumsy—for nearly killing other\nguardsmen. If you harm Shallan’s brothers, Mraize…”\n“We don’t harm our own,” Mraize said.\nSo remain one of us, that indicated. Radiant hated his games, though Veil\ndelighted in them. For now, however, Radiant remained in control. She was\nmaking progress.\n“The catch?” she asked, holding up the broam. “The problem?”\n“This power is something we call Investiture,” Mraize said. “Investiture\nmanifests in many forms, tied to many places and many different gods. It is\nbound to a specific land—making it very difficult to transport. It resists. Try\nto carry this too far, and you’d find it increasingly difficult to move, as it\nbecame increasingly heavy.\n“The same limitation restrains people who are themselves heavily\nInvested. Radiants, spren—anyone Connected to Roshar is bound by these\nlaws, and cannot travel farther than Ashyn or Braize. You are imprisoned\nhere, Radiant.”\n“A prison as large as three planets,” Radiant said. “Forgive me if I don’t\nfeel confined.”\nVeil, however, was hiding. Things like this daunted her—such large-\nscale ideas and problems. Shallan though … Shallan wanted to soar, learn,\ndiscover. And to find that she was restricted in that discovery, even if she’d"

And to find that she was restricted in that discovery, even if she’d\nnever known about the restriction, did bother her.\nMraize took the broam back. “This gemstone cannot go where it is\nneeded. A more perfect gemstone could contain the Light long enough to go\noffworld, but there is still the Connection problem. This little flaw has\ncaused untold trouble. And the one who unlocks the secret would have\nuntold power. Literal power, Radiant. The power to change worlds…”\n“So you want to unravel the secret,” Radiant said.\n“I already have,” Mraize said, making a fist. “Though putting the plan\ninto motion will be difficult. I have a job for you.”\n“We don’t want another job,” Radiant said. “It is time for this association\nto be finished.”\n“Are you certain? Are all three of you certain?”\nRadiant drew her lips to a line, but she knew the truth. No, they were not\ncertain. Reluctantly, she let Shallan emerge, hair bleeding to its natural\nauburn-red.\n“I have news for you,” Shallan said. “Sja-anat contacted me while I was\naway. She agreed to your terms, and is sending one of her spren to the\ntower, where it will investigate your members for a possible bond.”\n“Those weren’t the terms,” he said. “She was to promise me a spren to\nbond.”\n“Considering where we started last year,” Shallan said, “you should take\nwhat you can get. It’s been difficult to contact her lately; I think she’s\nworried about how people are treating Renarin.”\n“No,” Mraize said. “Odium watches. We must be careful. I will …\naccept these terms. Have you any other reports?”\n“Ialai’s agents have a spy close to Dalinar,” Shallan said. “So the Sons of\nHonor might not be completely stamped out yet.”\n“An interesting line of reasoning,” Mraize said, “but you’re wrong. The\nSons of Honor don’t have an agent close to Dalinar. They simply managed\nto intercept some communications from one of our agents who is close to\nDalinar.”\nAh … That explained a few things. Ialai didn’t have the reach to get close\nto Dalinar, but if she’d found a way to intercept intelligence from the\nGhostbloods, the result would be the same.\nMraize didn’t lie to her, as far as she’d been able to determine. So …\n“I don’t need to worry about two spies then,” Shallan said. “Only the one\nyou have watching me, the one who killed Ialai. It’s one of Adolin’s guards,\nisn’t it?”\n“Don’t be silly. We have no interest in men such as that. They offer us\nnothing.”\n“Who, then?”\n“I cannot betray this secret,” Mraize said. “Let’s just say that\nLightweavers fascinate me, and leave it at that. And you should not fear if I\ndid keep someone close to you. Such a person could be an … aid in times of\nneed. Iyatil did the same for me.”\nShallan fumed.

He all but promised the Ghostblood spy was among her\nLightweavers, which did make sense. Mraize would want someone who\ncould watch Shallan in places a soldier might not be able to reach. One of\nthe deserters then? Or Ishnah? One of the newer squires? The idea made her\nsick.\n“Iyatil has reported to Master Thaidakar,” Mraize said, “and he has\naccepted—after some initial anger—that we will not be able to control the\nOathgates. I explained that there at least is a calming wind in this, like the\nriddens of a storm. With Dalinar controlling the Oathgates, he can prosecute\nthe war against Odium.”\n“And that helps your cause?”\n“We have no interest in seeing the enemy rule this world, Shallan.\nMaster Thaidakar wishes only to secure a method for gathering and\ntransporting Stormlight.” Mraize held his broam up again. Like a miniature\nsun beside the real one.\n“Why attack the Sons of Honor though?” Shallan asked. “At first I\nunderstood—they were trying to find Urithiru before us. But now? What\nthreat was Ialai?”\n“Now that is a brilliant question,” Mraize said, and she couldn’t suppress\na thrill from Veil at being praised by him. “The secret has to do with\nGavilar. The old king. What was he doing?”\n“The same old question,” Shallan said. “I spent weeks researching his\nlife under Jasnah’s tutelage. She seemed to think he was after Shardblades.”\n“His aspirations were not nearly so lowly as that,” Mraize said. “He\nrecruited others, promising them a return to the old glories and powers.\nSome, like Amaram, listened because of these promises—but for the same\nreason were as easily lured by the enemy. Others were manipulated through\ntheir religious ideals. But Gavilar … what did he truly want?”\n“I don’t know. Do you?”\n“Immortality, in part. He thought he could become like the Heralds. In\nhis quest, he discovered a secret. He had Voidlight before the Everstorm—\nhe carried it from Braize, the place you call Damnation. He was testing the\nmovement of Light between worlds. And one close to him might have\nanswers. At any rate, we couldn’t risk Ialai or the Sons of Honor recovering\nthese secrets.”\nMraize’s chicken finished its meal. Though it had picked at and eaten the\nflesh, in the end it swallowed the rest of the corpse whole. Then it fluffed its\nfeathers and hunkered down. Shallan didn’t have a lot of experience with\nthe creature, but it seemed to dislike the cold.\nSo odd, how Mraize flaunted it. But she supposed that was part of who\nhe was—he was never content blending in. Most would probably consider\nkeeping strange exotic animals a quirk. Shallan couldn’t help but see more\nto it. Mraize collected trophies—she’d seen many odd things in his\npossession.\nShe blinked and took another Memory of the chicken on his arm,\nreceiving a scratch at its neck."

Mraize collected trophies—she’d seen many odd things in his\npossession.\nShe blinked and took another Memory of the chicken on his arm,\nreceiving a scratch at its neck.\n“There is so much out there, little knife,” Mraize said. “Things that will\nrock your understanding, expand your perspective, and make into pebbles\nwhat once seemed mountains. The things you could know, Shallan. The\npeople you could collect in your notebook, the sights you could see…”\n“Tell me,” she said, finding an unexpected hunger within. “Let me see\nthem. Let me know them.”\n“These things require effort and experience,” Mraize said. “I could not\nsimply be told of them, and neither can you. I have given you enough for\nnow. To go further, you must hunt the secrets. Earn them.”\nShe narrowed her eyes at him. “All right. What do you want this time?”\nHe grinned in his predatory way.\n“You always make me want to do the things you ask,” Shallan said. “You\ntempt me not just with rewards, but with the secrets—or the dangers—\nthemselves. You knew I’d be intrigued by what Amaram was studying. You\nknew I’d want to stop Ialai because of the threat she presented to Adolin. I\nalways end up doing what you want. So what is it this time? What are you\ngoing to make me do?”\n“You become a hunter in truth. I have known from the beginning your\npotential.” He looked to her, light violet eyes lingering on her still-red hair.\n“There is a man. Restares. You know the name?”\n“I’ve heard of him. He was connected to the Sons of Honor?” Though\nshe might have heard the name before getting Ialai’s book, it was written\nseveral times in there. The woman had been trying to contact him.\n“He was their leader, at one point,” Mraize said. “Perhaps their founder,\nthough we aren’t certain. Either way, he was involved from the beginning—\nand he knew the extent of what Gavilar was doing. Restares is perhaps the\nonly living person who did.”\n“Great. You want me to find him?”\n“Oh, we know where he is,” Mraize said. “He has asked for—and been\ngranted—asylum in a city no other Ghostblood has been able to enter.”\n“A place you can’t enter?” Shallan asked. “Where is security that tight?”\n“The fortress named Lasting Integrity,” Mraize said. “Home and capital\ncity of the honorspren in Shadesmar.”\nShallan let out a long whistle of appreciation. The chicken, curiously,\nmimicked it.\n“This is your mission,” Mraize said. “Find your way to Lasting Integrity.\nGet in, then find Restares. There should be no more than a handful of\nhumans in the city; in fact, he might be the only one. We don’t know.”\n“How am I supposed to accomplish that?”\n“You are resourceful,” Mraize said. “You and yours have connections to\nthe spren that no other Ghostblood has been able to manage so far.” His\neyes flickered to Pattern, who sat on her coat, silent as usual when others\nwere talking. “You will find a way.”"

I’m not going to kill him.”\n“Don’t be so hasty,” Mraize said. “When you find him, you’ll know what\nto do.”\n“I doubt that.”\n“Oh, you will. And once you successfully return from this mission, your\nreward will be—as always—something for which you hunger. Answers. All\nof them.”\nShe frowned.\n“We will hold nothing back,” Mraize said. “Everything we know\nbecomes yours after this.”\nShallan folded her arms, weighing her desires. For well over a year now,\nshe’d told herself that she only continued with the Ghostbloods to find out\ntheir secrets. But Veil liked being part of them. The thrill of the intrigue.\nEven the suspense of potentially being found out.\nShallan, however, had always been seeking answers. Real secrets. Surely\neven Jasnah couldn’t be too angry with Shallan. She was infiltrating them,\nseeking to find their answers. Once Shallan learned everything the\nGhostbloods had been hiding, she could go to Jasnah. What good would it\ndo to pull out when the ultimate prize was so close?\nI sense another reason you’re doing this, Shallan, Radiant thought at her.\nWhat is it? What aren’t you sharing with us?\n“Aren’t you afraid?” Shallan asked Mraize, ignoring Radiant. “If I know\nyour secrets, you’ll no longer have power to keep stringing me along. You\nwon’t be able to keep bribing me.”\n“If you do this, little knife,” he said, “you won’t need to be bribed any\nlonger. Once you complete the mission with Restares and return, you may\nask me any questions, and I will answer with what I know. About the world.\nAbout the Radiants. About other places. About you, and your past…”\nHe thought to tease that last one. But at it, Shallan shuddered, trembling\ndeep inside. Formless grew stronger each time she thought about that.\n“After getting your answers,” Mraize continued, “if you decide you no\nlonger desire our association, you may leave us as Radiant wishes. She is\nweak, but everyone has weakness within them. If you succumb to yours,\nthen so be it.”\nShe folded her arms, considering.\n“I’m being sincere,” Mraize said. “I cannot promise you will be safe if\nyou leave; other members of the organization do not like you. I do promise\nthat I will not hunt you or yours, nor will my babsk. We will discourage\nothers.”\n“An easy promise,” Shallan said, “because you are certain I will never\nleave the Ghostbloods.”\n“Find a reason to visit the honorspren,” Mraize said. “Then we shall\ntalk.” He lifted his arm and threw the bird off toward another hunt.\nShallan gave no promise, but as she walked away, she knew he had her.\nThey’d been hooked as soundly as any fish.

About the nature of the world and its politics, but more beyond.\nAbout Shallan. The Davar house steward had belonged to the Ghostbloods.\nIt was possible Shallan’s father had as well. Mraize had never been willing\nto speak of that, but she had to think they’d been grooming her—and her\nfamily—for over a decade.\nHe knew the truth about Shallan’s past. There were holes in her\nchildhood memories. If they did what he asked, Mraize would fill them.\nAnd maybe then, at long last, Veil could force Shallan to become\ncomplete.\nAll gemstones leak Stormlight at a slow rate—but so long as the\ncrystal structure remains mostly intact, the spren cannot escape.\nManaging this leakage is important, as many fabrials also lose\nStormlight through operation. All of this is tied up in the intricacies of\nthe art. As is understanding one last vital kind of spren: logicspren.\n—Lecture on fabrial mechanics presented by Navani Kholin to\nthe coalition of monarchs, Urithiru, Jesevan, 1175\nThe palace at Kholinar had undergone a dramatic transformation. To a new\nform, so to speak. Here, more than any other place in the city, Venli felt she\ncould look into the past and see the history of her people.\nGone was the ornate, but boring human fortress. In its place stood a\ngrand construction that used many of the original foundations and walls, but\nexpanded upon them in a unique design. Instead of boxy lines, it contained\ngrand arcs, with large ridges sweeping down from the sides like curved\nblades. These multiplied toward the top, the ridges rising to points.\nThe result was a curved conical shape, the peak resembling a crown. The\narchitecture had a distinctly organic feel, enhanced by walls grown over\nwith shalebark to give a rough, uneven texture. The palace vaguely\nresembled a plant: bulging at the base, with gentle blades sweeping up to\nthe cap.\nVenli approached, attuned to Tension. The last twenty hours had been a\nchaotic jumble as she’d accompanied Leshwi through the city, meeting with\nother Fused, looking for information. Venli didn’t completely understand\nwhy it had set Leshwi off, but a new group of Fused spirits had awakened\nand come for bodies.\nThat wasn’t unexpected. Some of the Fused on Braize slumbered, or …\nhibernated? Meditated? They were coming aware in groups, and joining the\nbattle. But several in particular had Leshwi worried. Perhaps terrified. After\na day of chaos spent investigating with Leshwi, Venli had awakened to\nthunder early in the morning. The Everstorm.\nRight after it, she’d received word. A conclave of the most important\nsingers had been called to the palace. As Voice, Venli was expected to arrive\nquickly—and on her own, for Leshwi would take the entrance provided for\nthe shanay-im above.\nVenli tried to calm herself as she walked by focusing on the beautiful\npalace structure.

She wished she could have lived in a time when this\narchitecture was commonplace. She imagined entire cities made of these\ntransfixing arcs, one part dangerous, one part beautiful. Like the natural\nworld.\nWe did this, she thought. When Eshonai first returned from the human\nlands, she spoke to Awe about the grand creations of the humans. But we\ndid things like this too. We had cities. We had art. We had culture.\nThe rebuilding of the palace had been overseen and accomplished by\nseveral Fused of a tall, limber variety called fannahn-im, Those Ones of\nAlteration. Though all Fused were trained as warriors, many had other\nskills. Some were engineers, scientists, architects. She thought perhaps\nthey’d all once been soldiers before being granted immortality, but the time\nthey’d had to grow since was expansive.\nWhat would it be like to live so many lives? Such wisdom, and such\ncapacity! Seeing such things awakened emotions within her. Not just Awe,\nbut Craving. Were new Fused being made? Could someone like her aspire\nto this immortality?\nTimbre pulsed a warning inside her, and Venli forcibly resisted those\ninstincts. It was not easy. Perhaps as a Surgebinder, she should have been\nnaturally selfless. Naturally noble. Like Eshonai.\nVenli was neither. A part of her still longed for the path she’d once\nimagined—blessed by the Fused for opening the way to their Return,\nheaped with honors for being the first among her people to listen to the\nVoidspren. Bringer of the Everstorm. Should she not have become a queen\nfor these actions?\nTimbre pulsed another warning, comforting this time. Odium would\nnever give her these honors—Venli had been deceived. Her lusts had led to\ngreat pain and destruction. She needed a way to balance her heritage and\nher goals. She was determined to escape the rule of the Fused, but that did\nnot mean she wanted to abandon singer culture. Indeed, the more she\ndiscovered about the singers of old, the more she wanted to know.\nShe reached the top of the steps and passed by two of the fannahn-im,\nthe Altered Ones, with limber, seven-foot-tall bodies and piles of hair that\nsprouted only from the very tops of their heads, tumbling down around the\ncarapace that covered the rest of their skulls. These two had not been among\nthose who had built the palace, for they sat with vacant stares. Timbre\npulsed to the Rhythm of the Lost. Gone. Like so many of the Fused, their\nminds had been claimed by the infinite cycle of death and rebirth.\nPerhaps there was a reason not to envy their immortality.\nThe inner entryway of the palace had been rebuilt with sweeping\nstaircases. Walls had been removed, and dozens of rooms had been\ncombined. In the large chambers, they didn’t shut the windows during\nstorms; they simply rolled up the carpets.\nVenli climbed all the way to the fifth floor, entering a pinnacle room\nadded by the Fused architects.

Large and cylindrical, it was the center of the\ncrown shape. This place was the home of the Nine: leaders of the Fused.\nOther Voices were gathering. There were some thirty of them—she’d\nbeen led to believe that there would be as many as a hundred, once all the\nFused were awake. This room wouldn’t hold that many Voices, even if they\nlined up shoulder-to-shoulder. As it was, it was growing crowded as each\nVoice found their place before their master.\nLeshwi hovered a few feet off the ground near the other Heavenly Ones,\nand Venli hastened over. She looked up, and Leshwi nodded, so Venli\nthumped the butt of her staff on the stones, indicating her master was ready.\nThe Nine were already there, of course. They couldn’t leave. They’d\nbeen entombed in stone.\nNine pillars adorned the center of the chamber, rising in a circle. The\nstones had been Soulcast into shape—with people inside them. The Nine\nlived here, permanently melded into the pillars. Again there was an organic\nfeel to the construction, as if the pillars had grown there like trees around\nthe Nine.\nThe pillars twisted and tapered, shrinking and growing into the chests of\nthe Nine but leaving their heads and the tops of their carapaced shoulders\nbare. Most had at least one arm free.\nThe Nine faced inward, their backs to the room. The bizarre entombment\nwas discomforting, alien. Nauseating. It lent the Nine an air of permanence\nto accent their ageless nature. The pillars seemed to say, “These are older\nthan the stones. They have lived here long enough for the rock to grow over\nthem, like crem reclaiming the ruins of a fallen city.”\nVenli couldn’t help but be impressed by their dedication; being locked\ninto motionlessness like this had to be agonizing. The Nine did not eat,\nsubsisting on Odium’s Light alone. Surely this entombment wasn’t good for\ntheir sanity.\nThough … if they really did want to leave their imprisonment, they\ncould simply have themselves killed. A Fused could also will their spirit\nfrom their body, freeing it to seek another host. Indeed, the humans had\ntried imprisoning Fused as a method of defeating them, but had found it to\nbe futile.\nSo the Nine could leave, if they wanted. In that light, these tombs were a\nflagrant, wasteful act—the ultimate price for this show was paid not by the\nNine, but by the poor singers they had killed to give themselves bodies.\nThe Nine must have counted the knocking of the staffs on the ground,\nfor they raised their heads in unison once the final high lord was in place.\nVenli glanced at Leshwi, who was humming softly to Agony—the new\nrhythm that was a counterpart to Anxiety.\n“What is happening?” Venli whispered to Craving. “What does this have\nto do with the new Fused who have awakened?”\n“Watch,” Leshwi whispered. “But take care. Remember, what power I\nhave outside is a mere candle’s light in here.”\nLeshwi was, for a high lady, low ranked. A field commander, but still"

She was both the very crust of the unimportant and the\nvery dregs of the important. She was always careful in walking that line.\nThe Nine hummed together, then began singing in unison, a song and\nrhythm Venli had never heard. It sent chills through her, particularly when\nshe realized she couldn’t understand the lyrics. She felt near to\ncomprehending—it was almost within reach—but her powers seemed to\nshy back from this song. As though … if she could understand, her mind\nwould not be able to handle the meaning.\nShe was fairly certain what this indicated. Odium, the god of the singers,\nwas watching this conclave. She knew his touch, his stench. He was\nforbidding any of the Voices from interpreting this song.\nIt died down, and silence claimed the chamber. “We would hear a\nreport,” one of the Nine said at last—Venli had trouble telling who spoke,\nsince they were all facing one another. “A firsthand account of what was\nseen at the recent clash in northern Avendla.”\nAvendla was their name for Alethkar; Venli’s powers instantly knew the\nmeaning of the word. Land of the Second Advance. Her abilities stopped\nthere, however, and she couldn’t answer the more interesting question. Why\nwas it called that?\nLeshwi hummed, so Venli stepped forward and cracked her scepter\nagainst the floor twice, then bowed, head down.\nLeshwi rose behind her, clothing rustling. “I will have Zandiel provide\nsketches. The large human ship flew of its own power, using no gemstones\nwe could see—though certainly they were embedded somewhere inside.”\n“It flew by Lashings,” one of the Nine said. “The work of Windrunners.”\n“No,” Leshwi said. “It did not have that appearance or that feel. This was\na device, a machine. Created by their artifabrians.”\nThe Nine sang together, and their alien song made Timbre—deep within\nVenli—pulse nervously.\n“We were away far too long,” one of the Nine said. “It has let the\nhumans fester like an infection, gaining strength. They create devices we\nhave never known.”\n“We are behind them, not ahead,” another said. “It is a dangerous\nposition from which to fight.”\n“No,” said a third. “They have made great strides in understanding the\nprisons of spren, but they know little about the bond, the power of oaths, the\nnature of the tones of the world. They are cremlings building a nest beneath\nthe shadow of a great temple. They take pride in what they have done, but\ncannot grasp the beauties around them.”\n“Still,” said the first. “Still. We could not have crafted the flying device\nthey have.”\n“Why would we? We have the shanay-im.”\nVenli remained bowed, hand on her staff.

The Nine spoke for the ears of those\nlistening. They could have conversed quietly, but these meetings were about\nthe spectacle.\n“Leshwi,” one of the Nine said. “What of the suppressor we sent to be\ntested? Did it work?”\n“It worked,” Leshwi said, “but it was also lost. The humans captured it. I\nfear this will lead them to further explorations and discoveries.”\n“This was poorly handled,” said one of the Fused.\n“I take no responsibility for this error,” Leshwi said. “You must speak to\nthe Pursuer to find record of the mistake.”\nEach spoke with formal tones and rhythms. Venli had the impression that\nthe Nine knew how these answers would play out.\n“Lezian!” the Nine called together. “You will—”\n“Oh, dispense with the pageantry,” a loud voice said. A tall Fused\nemerged from the shadows on the far side of the room.\nLeshwi lowered down, and Venli straightened and stepped back into line\nbefore her master. That gave her a good view of this new Fused, which was\nof a variety that Venli had never seen. Enormous, with jagged carapace and\ndeep red hair, the being wore only a simple black wrap for clothing. Or …\nwas his hair the clothing? It seemed to meld with the wrap.\nFascinating. Nex-im, Those Ones of Husks, the ninth brand of Fused.\nShe had heard them spoken of; supposedly very few existed. Was this the\nrecently awakened Fused who had Leshwi so concerned?\n“Lezian, the Pursuer,” said one of the Nine. “You were entrusted with a\ndelicate device, a suppressor of Stormlight abilities. You were told to test it.\nWhere is this device?”\n“I tested it,” Lezian snapped, showing little of the formality or respect\nothers gave the Nine. “It didn’t work.”\n“You are certain of this?” the Nine asked. “Was the man Invested when\nhe attacked you?”\n“You think I could be defeated by a common human?” the Pursuer\ndemanded. “This Windrunner must be of the Fourth Ideal—something I was\nled to believe had not yet happened. Perhaps our reconnaissance teams have\nlost their edge, during the long time spent between Returns.”\nBehind Venli, Leshwi hummed sharply to Conceit. She did not like that\nimplication.\n“Regardless,” the Pursuer said, “I was killed. The Windrunner is more\ndangerous than any of us were led to believe. I must pursue him now, as is\nmy right by tradition. I will leave immediately.”\nCurious, Venli thought. If he’d fought Stormblessed, then he could not\nbe the newly awakened one that Leshwi feared. The Pursuer stood with\narms crossed as the Nine began to sing to one another again, softer than\nbefore. In the past, such deliberations had taken several minutes. Many of\nthe other Fused began conferring quietly as they waited.\nVenli leaned back, whispering, “Who is he, Lady?”\n“A hero,” Leshwi responded to Withdrawal. “And a fool. Millennia ago,"

        "text": "the other Fused began conferring quietly as they waited.\nVenli leaned back, whispering, “Who is he, Lady?”\n“A hero,” Leshwi responded to Withdrawal. “And a fool. Millennia ago,\nLezian was the first Fused to be killed by a human. To avoid the shame of\nsuch death, upon returning to life, Lezian ignored all orders and rational\narguments—and went into battle seeking only the man who had killed him.\n“He was successful, and his tradition was born. Any time he is killed,\nLezian ignores everything else until he has claimed the life of the one who\nkilled him. Seven thousand years, and he’s never failed. Now the others—\neven those chosen as the Nine—encourage his quests.”\n“I thought in the past, you were exiled to Braize once you died? How\ncould he return to hunt the one who had killed him?”\nMuch of this was still confusing to Venli. For thousands of years, the\nhumans and the singers had fought many rounds of an eternal war. Each\nnew wave of attacks had involved what was called a Return, when the\nFused would descend to Roshar. The humans called these Desolations.\nThere was something special about the way the human Heralds\ninteracted that could lock the Fused on Braize, the land called Damnation\nby the humans. Only once the Fused broke the Heralds through torture—\nsending them back to Roshar—could a Return be initiated. This cycle had\nplayed out for millennia, until the Last Desolation, where something had\nchanged. Something to do with a single Herald and an unbreakable will.\n“You mistake the cycle, simplify it,” Leshwi said softly. “We were only\nlocked on Braize once the Heralds died and joined us there. Until then,\nthere would often be years or even decades of rebirths during a Return—\nduring which time the Heralds would train humans to fight. Once they were\nconfident that humans could continue to stand, the Heralds would give\nthemselves to Braize to activate the Isolation. The Heralds would need to\ndie for this to work.”\n“But … they didn’t die the last time?” Venli said. “They remained, but\nyou were still locked away.”\n“Yes…” Leshwi said. “They somehow found a way to shift the Oathpact\nto depend on a single member.” She nodded toward the Pursuer.\n“Regardless, before an Isolation began, that one always managed to find\nand kill any humans who had bested him. As soon as the Isolation was\nbegun, he’d kill himself, so he’d never return to Braize permanently after\nhaving died by human hand.\n“As I said, the others encourage his tradition. He is allowed to act\noutside command structures, given leeway to Pursue. When he is not\nhunting one who killed him, he seeks to fight the strongest of the enemy\nRadiants.”\n“That sounds like a worthy Passion,” Venli said, picking her words\ncarefully.\n“Yes, it does sound like one,” Leshwi said to Derision. “Perhaps it would\nbe, in someone less reckless. Lezian has endangered our plans, undermined\nstrategies, and ruined more missions than I can count. And he’s growing\nworse. As all of us are, I suppose…”"

As all of us are, I suppose…”\n“He was killed by the Windrunner hero?” Venli asked. “The one they call\nStormblessed?”\n“Yes, yesterday. And the Radiant’s powers were suppressed at the time,\nno matter what Lezian said. Stormblessed is not yet of the Fourth Ideal. I\nwould know. This is doubly a shame on the Pursuer. He grows careless,\noverly confident. These Radiants are new to their powers, but that does not\nmake them less worthy.”\n“You like them,” Venli said, cautiously broaching the topic. “The\nWindrunners.”\nLeshwi was silent for a moment. “Yes,” she said. “They and their spren\nwould make excellent servants, should we be able to subdue them.”\nSo she was open to new ideas, new ways of thinking. Perhaps she would\nreact favorably to the idea of a new nation of listeners.\n“Announce me, Voice,” Leshwi said.\n“Now?” Venli said, shocked out of her contemplations. “While the Nine\nare conferring?”\nLeshwi hummed to Command, so Venli scrambled to obey, stepping\nforward and slamming the butt of her staff against the floor, then bowing.\nThe Nine interrupted their song, and the one who spoke said the words to\nDestruction. “What is this, Leshwi?”\n“I have more to say,” Leshwi proclaimed to Command. “The Pursuer is\nlosing control. He approaches the state where his mind and intentions\ncannot be trusted. He was defeated by a common human. It is time for\nspecial privileges to be revoked.”\nLezian spun toward her, shouting to Destruction, “How dare you!”\n“You are low to make such a declaration, Leshwi,” one of the Nine said.\n“This is both above and beneath you, at once.”\n“I speak my Passion,” she said. “The man who killed the Pursuer has\nkilled me. I claim prior privilege to the life of Stormblessed. The Pursuer\nmust, in this case, wait upon my pleasure.”\n“You know my tradition!” he shouted at Leshwi.\n“Traditions can be broken.”\nThe tall Fused stomped toward her, and Venli had to forcibly hold herself\nin place, bowing—though she was allowed to look up and watch. This\nPursuer was enormous, intimidating. He was also nearly out of control, a\nstorm at its height—so angry she couldn’t make out the rhythm to his\nshouted words.\n“I will hunt you!” he shouted. “You cannot deny me my vows! My\ntradition cannot be broken!”\nLeshwi continued to hover in place unperturbed, and Venli saw an\nulterior motive in the conflict. Yes, the Nine were humming to Derision. In\nlosing his temper, the Pursuer proved his Passion—a good thing to them—\nbut also risked proving he was going crazy. Leshwi had purposefully\ngoaded him.\n“We accept Leshwi’s prior claim on this man,” the Nine said. “Pursuer,\nyou will not hunt this human until Leshwi has a chance to battle him again.”"

But know that if a battle\ncomes and he must be removed, another may be granted the task.”\n“This is understood and accepted,” Leshwi said.\nNone of them realize she’s trying to protect that Windrunner, Venli\nthought. Maybe she doesn’t realize it herself. There were schisms among the\nFused, cracks much larger than any would admit. What could be done to\ntake advantage of them?\nTimbre pulsed inside her, but in this case Venli was certain her ambition\nwas well placed. To lack it would be to simply go along with whatever she\nwas told. That was not freedom. Freedom, if she was to seek it, would\nrequire ambition—in the right place.\nThe Pursuer, still raging to no particular rhythm, stomped out of the\nconclave chamber. Leshwi settled down behind Venli, humming softly to\nExultation.\n“Do not praise yourself overly much, Leshwi,” one of the Nine called.\n“Do not forget your low station in this room. We have our own reasons for\ndenying the Pursuer.”\nLeshwi bowed her head as the Nine returned to their private\nconversation.\n“You could be more,” Venli whispered, returning to her place beside\nLeshwi. “These are not as clever as you are, Lady. Why do you let them\ncontinue to treat you so poorly?”\n“I have chosen my station carefully,” Leshwi snapped. “Do not challenge\nme on this, Voice. It is not your place.”\n“I apologize,” Venli said to Agony. “My Passion outstripped my\nwisdom.”\n“That was not Passion, but curiosity.” Leshwi narrowed her eyes. “Be\nalert. This matter was not the reason the conclave was called. The danger\nI’ve been fearing is yet to come.”\nThat made Venli stand up straighter, on her guard. Eventually the Nine\nstopped singing, but they did not address the leaders of the Fused. Instead\nthe hall fell silent. Moments stretched to minutes. What was happening?\nA figure darkened the doorway of the chamber, backlit by sunlight. It\nwas a tall femalen, of the fannahn-im—the builders who had created the\npalace—with a tall topknot of hair and carapace like a helmet otherwise\ncovering her head. She wore a luxurious robe and was willowy, with a\nnarrow figure and long arms, fingers fully twice the length of Venli’s.\nLeshwi hissed. “Gods, no. Not her.”\n“What?” Venli asked as the room flooded with whispers from the others.\n“Who is she?”\n“I thought her mad,” Leshwi said to Agony. “How…”\nThe tall Fused walked into the room and did a slow, careful loop around\nthe perimeter, perhaps to make certain she was seen by everyone.

Then she\ndid something Venli had never seen anyone do—no matter how high. She\nwalked into the center of the Nine and looked them in the eyes.\n“What does it mean, Lady?” Venli asked.\n“She was one of the Nine for many centuries,” Leshwi said. “Until she\ndecided it was too … hampering upon her ambitions. After the last Return,\nand her madness, she was to remain asleep.… Why…”\n“Raboniel, Lady of Wishes,” one of the Nine said. “You have brought us\na proposal. Please speak it.”\n“It is obvious,” Raboniel said, “that the humans have been allowed too\nmuch time to grow. They run rampant across Roshar. They have steel\nweapons and advanced military tactics. They outstrip our own knowledge in\nareas.\n“The one thing they do not yet have is mastery over their powers. There\nare few among them of the Fourth Ideal—perhaps only one individual—and\nthey do not have full access to the tower, now that the Sibling is dead. We\nmust strike now. We must seize the tower from them.”\nLeshwi moved forward, not waiting for Venli to announce her. “This was\ntried! We attempted to seize the tower, and failed!”\n“That?” Raboniel said. “That was a stalling tactic intended to isolate the\nBondsmith. The strike could never have succeeded. I was not involved.”\n“You forget your place again, Leshwi,” one of the Nine said. “This\nmakes us wonder if you are the one who is losing her mind.”\nLeshwi retreated to her spot, and Venli felt the eyes of the other thirty\nFused and their Voices on her, shaming her as they hummed.\n“You have nearly perfected the suppression fabrials,” Raboniel said. “Do\nnot forget, it is technology I discovered from the tower itself thousands of\nyears ago. I have a plan to use it in a more dramatic way. As the Sibling is\nessentially a deadeye, I should be able to turn the tower’s defenses against\nits owners.”\nA Voice across the room stepped forward and thumped his staff,\nannouncing Uriam the Defiant. “Pardon,” Uriam said to Craving. “But are\nyou implying that you can suppress the powers of the Radiants inside their\nown tower?”\n“Yes,” Raboniel said. “The device preventing us from attacking them\nthere can be inverted. We will need to lure the Elsecaller and the Bondsmith\naway. Their oaths may be advanced enough to push through the\nsuppression, much as the Unmade have done at the tower in the past. With\nthem gone, I can lead a force into Urithiru and seize it from within—and the\nRadiants will be unable to resist.”\nThe Nine started singing to one another privately, giving everyone else\ntime for conversations. Venli looked to her mistress. Leshwi rarely spent\nthese moments talking to the other high Fused; she was beneath most of\nthem, after all.\n“I don’t understand,” Venli whispered.\n“Raboniel is a scholar,” Leshwi said. “But not the kind you would wish\nto work beneath.

We used to call her Lady of Pains, until she decided she\ndidn’t like the title.” Her expression grew distant. “She has always been\nfascinated by the tower and the connection between Radiants. Their oaths,\ntheir spren. Their Surges.\n“During the last Return, she developed a disease intended to kill all\nhumans on the planet. Near the end, it was discovered that the disease\nwould likely kill many singers as well. She released it anyway … only to\nfind, to all of our fortunes, that it did not work as expected. Fewer than one\nin ten humans were killed, and one in a hundred singers.”\n“That’s terrible!” Venli said.\n“Extinction is the natural escalation of this war,” Leshwi whispered. “If\nyou forget why you are fighting, then victory itself becomes the goal. The\nlonger we fight, the more detached we become. Both from our own minds,\nand from our original Passions.” She hummed softly to Abashment.\n“Explain your plan, Raboniel,” one of the Nine said, loudly enough to\ncut through conversations.\n“I will lead a team into the tower,” Raboniel said, “then secure control of\nthe Sibling’s heart. Using my natural talents, and the gifts of Odium, I will\ncorrupt that heart, and turn the tower to our needs. The humans will fall;\ntheir powers will not work, but ours will. From there I suspect that—with a\nlittle time—I can learn much studying the gemstones at the Sibling’s heart.\nPerhaps enough to create new weapons against the Radiants and the\nhumans.”\nOne of the Heavenly Ones, a malen named Jeshishin, came forward as\nhis Voice rapped the floor. “As Leshwi said, we did strike at the tower a\nyear ago. True, that attempt was not meant to be a permanent seizure, but\nwe were rebuffed. I would know the specifics of what we will do this time\nto ensure victory.”\n“We will use the king who has given himself to us,” Raboniel said. “He\nhas delivered intelligence about guard patterns. We don’t need to take the\nentire tower at first—we simply need to get to the heart and use my\nknowledge to turn the defenses to our advantage.”\n“The heart is the most well-guarded location!” Jeshishin said.\nRaboniel spoke to Conceit. “Then it is fortunate that we have an agent in\ntheir inner circle, is it not?”\nJeshishin floated back, his Voice returning to his place.\n“What is her true game?” Leshwi whispered to Craving. “Raboniel has\nnever really been interested in the war or its tactics. This must be about\nsomething more. She wants the opportunity to experiment upon the\nSibling.…”\n“This is dangerous,” one of the Nine loudly said to the room. “The\nhumans are suspicious of Taravangian already. He reports that he is watched\nat all times. If we use his intelligence in this way, there is little doubt he will\nbe compromised entirely.”\n“Let him be compromised!” Raboniel said. “What good is a weapon if\nyou don’t swing it? Why have you delayed? The humans are untrained,"

The humans are untrained,\ntheir powers fledgling, their understanding laughable. I find it embarrassing\nto awaken and find you struggling against these pitiful shadows of our\nonce-mighty enemies.\n“Without the tower, their coalition will disintegrate, as they will be\nunable to deliver support through the Oathgates. We will gain great\nadvantage through the use of those same portals. In addition, this endeavor\nwill give me the opportunity to test some … theories I have developed\nwhile slumbering these last millennia. I am increasingly certain I have\ndiscovered a path that will lead to an end to the war.”\nLeshwi hissed out slowly, and Venli felt cold. It seemed that whatever\nRaboniel thought would end the war would involve techniques best left\nuntouched.\nThe rest of the room, however, appeared impressed. They whispered to\nSubservience, indicating consent to the idea. Even the Nine started\nhumming to the rhythm. The Fused put on a strong Passionate show, but\nthere was a fatigue to these ancient souls. It underpinned their other\nPassions, like the true color of a dyed cloth. Wash it, leave it out in the\nstorms long enough, and the core shone through.\nThese creatures were fraying, surrendering their minds—their will and\nvery individuality offered up to Odium on the altar of eternal war. Perhaps\nthe humans were new to their abilities, untested, but the Fused were old\naxes, chipped and weathered. They would take great risks, after so many\nrebirths, to be finished at last.\n“What of Stormblessed?” a voice called out, thickly accented, from the\nrecesses of the grand chamber.\nVenli found herself humming to Abashment as she searched the room.\nWho had spoken so brashly without first ordering their Voice to step\nforward? She found him sitting on a raised ledge up above, in shadow, right\nas her mind connected the accent to the lack of decorum.\nVyre. The human, once called Moash. He dressed like a soldier, with\nperfectly trimmed hair, a sharp uniform cut after human tailoring. He was\nan oddity. Why did the Nine continue to suffer him? Not only that, why had\nthey given him an Honorblade, one of the most precious relics on Roshar?\nHe draped one leg off the ledge. Held in his lap, his sword reflected\nsunlight as the tip moved. “He’ll stop you,” Vyre said. “You should have a\nplan for dealing with him.”\n“Ah, the human,” Raboniel said, looking at Vyre on his ledge. “I’ve\nheard of you. Such an interesting specimen. Odium favors you.”\n“He takes my pain,” Vyre said. “And leaves me to achieve my potential.\nYou did not answer my question. What of Stormblessed?”\n“I’m not afraid of a Windrunner, no matter how … mythical his\nreputation may be growing,” Raboniel said. “We will focus our attention on\nthe Bondsmith and the Elsecaller. They are more dangerous than any simple\nsoldier.”\n“Well,” Vyre said, pulling the tip of his sword back into the shadows,"

They are more dangerous than any simple\nsoldier.”\n“Well,” Vyre said, pulling the tip of his sword back into the shadows,\n“I’m sure you know your business, Fused.”\nThe Nine, as always, suffered the strange human. His position had been\nchosen by Odium. Leshwi seemed to think highly of him—of course, he’d\nonce killed her, and that was a sure way to gain her respect.\n“Your proposal is bold, Raboniel,” one of the Nine said. “And decisive.\nWe have long been without your guidance in this Return, and we welcome\nyour Passion. We will move forward as you request. Prepare a team for your\ninfiltration of the tower, and we shall contact the human Taravangian with\ninstructions. He can divert the Bondsmith and Elsecaller.”\nRaboniel sang loudly to Satisfaction, a stately and decisive sound. Venli\nwas reasonably certain this entire meeting had been for show—the Nine had\nnot stopped to debate the plan. They’d known what Raboniel would\nsuggest, and had already worked out the details.\nThe other Fused waited respectfully as Raboniel—her victorious\nproposal elevating her further in their eyes—walked toward the exit. Only\none of the Fused moved. Leshwi.\n“Come,” she said, floating after Raboniel.\nVenli hurried, joining Leshwi as she intercepted the tall femalen just\noutside the doors. Raboniel looked over Leshwi, humming to Derision as\nthe two emerged into sunlight on the balcony rooftop around the chamber.\nThe stairwell down was to the right.\n“Why did you seek to block my proposal, Leshwi?” Raboniel asked.\n“Have you begun to feel the effects of madness?”\n“I am not mad, but afraid,” Leshwi said to Abashment—and Venli\nstarted at the words. Lady Leshwi, afraid? “Do you truly think you can end\nthe war?”\n“I’m certain of it,” Raboniel said to Derision. “I have had a long time to\nponder on the discoveries made before the end of the false Return.” She\nreached into the pocket of her robe and removed a gemstone glowing with\nStormlight, a shifting spren captured inside. A fabrial like the humans\ncreated.\n“They imprisoned some of the Unmade in these, Leshwi,” Raboniel said.\n“How close do you think they are to discovering they could do the same for\nus? Can you imagine it? Forever imprisoned in a gemstone, locked away,\nable to think but unable to ever break free?”\nLeshwi hummed to Panic, a pained rhythm with unfinished measures and\nchopped-up beats.\n“One way or another,” Raboniel said, “this is the final Return. The\nhumans will soon discover how to imprison us. If not, well, the best of us\nwho remain are but a few steps from madness. We must find a solution to\nthis war.”\n“You are newly Returned,” Leshwi said. “You have no servants or staff.\nYour undertaking will require both.” She gestured to the side, to Venli. “I\nhave gathered a staff of faithful and highly capable singers. I would lend\nthem to you for this enterprise, and would attend you myself, as an apology\nfor my objections.”"

She bowed her head and hummed to Subservience to\nkeep from revealing her true feelings.\n“She was cast off by Odium,” Leshwi said. “I have found her an\nexcellent Voice.”\n“The daughter of traitors,” Raboniel said, but to Craving—she was\ncurious about Venli. “Then a traitor to her own kind. I will take her, and\nthose you send, as my servants during the infiltration. You may join us as\nwell. Serve, and perhaps I will forgive your crass objections. There were\ncertainly others thinking the same; you gave opportunity for refutation.”\nRaboniel strode away, though as she reached the steps, Venli spotted\nsomeone waiting for her in the shadows below. The hulking figure of the\nPursuer, who had been dismissed earlier. He bowed to Raboniel, who\nhesitated at the top of the stairwell. Their exchange was not audible to\nVenli.\n“He’s begging for a chance to go with her,” Leshwi whispered.\n“Raboniel will have jurisdiction during this infiltration—and can authorize\nhim to continue his hunt. He will try anything to justify another chance at\nthat Windrunner. I fear he will ignore the Nine, particularly if Raboniel\napproves of him.” She looked to Venli. “You must gather our people and\nattend her. You will not need to fight; that will be done by others. You will\nserve her as you have me, and report to me in secret.”\n“Mistress?” Venli asked. She lowered her voice. “So you don’t trust her.”\n“Of course not,” Leshwi said. “Last time, her recklessness nearly cost us\neverything. The Nine favor her boldness; they feel the weight of time. Yet\nboldness can be one step from foolishness. So we must prevent a\ncatastrophe. This land is for the ordinary singers to inherit. I will not leave it\ndesolate simply to prove we can murder better than our enemies.”\nVenli swelled at that. Timbre surged inside her, pulsing, encouraging her.\n“Mistress,” she whispered, “do you think there … could be a way to re-\nform my people? Find a land away from both Fused and humans? To be on\nour own again, as we were?”\nLeshwi hummed to Reprimand, glancing toward the chamber with the\nother Fused. None had left yet. They wouldn’t want to be seen rushing after\nRaboniel—and Venli realized, in a moment of understanding, why Leshwi\npreferred to remain lowly among them.

That is how to\nachieve your independence, Venli.”\n“Yes, mistress,” she said to Subservience. She didn’t feel it, and Timbre\npulsed her own frustration.\nVenli had felt Odium’s hand directly. He would not leave this people\nalone, and she suspected the other Fused—tired though they might be—\nwould not abandon ruling the world. Too many of them enjoyed the luxury\nof their positions. Victory for them was no path to independence for Venli\nand her people.\nLeshwi soared off, leaving Venli to walk down the steps. As she did, she\ncaught sight of Raboniel and the Pursuer speaking conspiratorially in the\ndim reaches of the third floor. Storms, what was Venli getting pulled into\nnow?\nTimbre pulsed inside her.\n“Opportunity?” Venli said. “What kind of opportunity?”\nTimbre pulsed again.\n“I thought you hated the human Radiants,” Venli whispered. “Who cares\nif we’re going to find them at the tower?”\nTimbre pulsed decisively. She had a point. Perhaps the humans could\ntrain Venli. Maybe she could capture one of their Radiants and make them\nteach her.\nAt any rate, she needed to prepare her staff to leave the city. Her\nrecruitment efforts would have to be put on hold. Like it or not, she was\ngoing to be at the forefront of another invasion of the human lands.\nLogicspren react curiously to imprisonment. Unlike other spren, they\ndo not manifest some attribute—you cannot use them to make heat, or\nto warn of nearby danger, or conjoin gemstones. For years,\nartifabrians considered them useless—indeed, experimenting with\nthem was uncommon, since logicspren are rare and difficult to capture.\nA breakthrough has come in discovering that logicspren will vary\nthe light they radiate based on certain stimuli. For example, if you\nmake the Light leak from the gemstone at a controlled rate, the spren\nwill alternate dimming and brightening in a regular pattern. This has\nled to fabrial clocks.\nWhen the gemstone is tapped with certain metals, the light will also\nchange states from bright to dim. This is leading to some very\ninteresting and complex mechanisms.\n—Lecture on fabrial mechanics presented by Navani Kholin to\nthe coalition of monarchs, Urithiru, Jesevan, 1175\nIn the weeks following the assault on Hearthstone, Kaladin’s anxiety began\nto subside, and he pushed through the worst of the darkness. He always\nemerged on the other side. Why was that so difficult to remember while in\nthe middle of it?\nHe’d been given time to decide what to do after his “retirement,” so he\ndidn’t rush the decision, and didn’t tell anyone other than Adolin. He\nwanted to find the best way to introduce the idea to his Windrunners—and\nif he could, make his decision first. Better to bring them a clear plan."

Better to bring them a clear plan.\nHe found himself understanding Dalinar’s order more and more as the\ndays passed. At least Kaladin didn’t have to keep pretending he wasn’t\nexhausted. He did delay his decision though. So Dalinar eventually gave\nhim a gentle—but firm—nudge. Kaladin could have a little more time to\ndecide his path, but they needed to start promoting other Windrunners to\ntake over his duties.\nSo it was that ten days after the mission to Hearthstone, Kaladin stood in\nfront of the army’s command staff and listened to Dalinar announce that\nKaladin’s role in the army was “evolving.”\nKaladin found the experience humiliating. Everyone applauded his\nheroism even as he was forced out. Kaladin announced that Sigzil—with\nwhom he’d conferred earlier in the day—would take over daily\nadministration of the Windrunners, overseeing things like supplies and\nrecruitment. He’d be named to the rank of companylord. Skar, when he\nreturned from leave at the Horneater Peaks, would be named company\nsecond, and would oversee and lead active Windrunner missions.\nA short time later, Kaladin was allowed to go—fortunately, there was no\nforced “party” for him. He retreated down a long dark hallway in Urithiru,\nrelieved that he didn’t feel nearly as bad as he had worried he would. He\nwasn’t a danger to himself today.\nNow he just had to find new purpose in life. Storms, that scared him—\nhaving nothing to do reminded him of being a bridgeman. When he wasn’t\non bridge runs, those days had stretched. Full of blank space that numbed\nthe mind, a strange mental anesthetic. His life was far better now. He wasn’t\nso lost in self-pity that he couldn’t notice or acknowledge that. Still, he\nfound the similarity uncomfortable.\nSyl hovered in front of him in the Urithiru hallway, taking the form of a\nfanciful ship—only with sails on the bottom. “What is that?” Kaladin asked\nher.\n“I don’t know,” she said, sailing past him. “Navani was drawing it during\na meeting a few weeks ago. I think she got mixed up. Maybe she hasn’t\nseen boats before?”\n“I sincerely doubt that’s the case,” Kaladin said, looking down the\nhallway. Nothing to do.\nNo, he thought. You can’t pretend you have nothing to do because you’re\nscared. Find a new purpose.\nHe took a deep breath, then strode forward. He could at least act\nconfident. Hav’s first rule of leadership, drilled into Kaladin on his first day\nas a squadleader. Once you make a decision, commit to it.\n“Where are we going?” Syl asked, transforming into a ribbon of light to\ncatch up to him.\n“Sparring grounds.”\n“Going to try some training to take your mind off things?”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “I’m going to—against my better judgment—seek\nwisdom there.”\n“Many of the ardents who train there seem pretty wise to me,” she said.\n“After all, they shave their heads.”"

It seems smart to shave it off.”\n“You have hair.”\n“I do not; I just have me. Think about it, Kaladin. Everything else that\ncomes out of your body you dispose of quickly and quietly—but this\nstrange stuff oozes out of little holes in your head, and you let it sit there?\nGross.”\n“Not all of us have the luxury of being fragments of divinity.”\n“Actually, everything is a fragment of divinities. We’re relatives that\nway.” She zipped in closer to him. “You humans are merely the weird\nrelatives that live out in the stormshelter; the ones we try not to let visitors\nknow about.”\nKaladin could smell the sparring grounds before he arrived—the\nmingled familiar scents of sweat and sword oil. Syl shot to the left, making\na loop of the room as Kaladin hurried past shouting pairs of men engaged in\nbouts of all types. He made his way to the rear wall where the swordmasters\ncongregated.\nHe’d always found martial ardents to be a strange bunch. Ordinary\nardents made more sense: they joined the church for scholarly reasons, or\nbecause of family pressure, or because they were devout and wanted to\nserve the Almighty. Most martial ardents had different pasts. Many had\nonce been soldiers, then given themselves over to the church. Not to serve,\nbut to escape. He’d never really understood what might lead someone to\nwalk that path. Not until recently.\nAs he walked among the training soldiers, he was reminded why he’d\nstopped coming. Bowing, murmurs of “Stormblessed,” people making way\nfor him. That was fine in the hallways, when he passed people who didn’t\nknow him. But the ones who trained here were his brothers—and in some\nfew cases sisters—in arms. They should know he didn’t need such\nattention.\nHe reached the swordmasters—but unfortunately, the man he sought\nwasn’t among them. Master Lahar explained that Zahel was on laundry\ndetail, which surprised Kaladin. Though he knew all ardents took turns on\nservice detail, he wouldn’t have thought a swordmaster would be sent to\nwash clothing.\nAs he left the sparring chamber, Syl came soaring back to him, wearing\nthe shape of an arrow in flight. “Did I hear you asking for Zahel?” she\nasked.\n“You did. Why?”\n“It’s just that … there are several swordmasters, Kaladin. A few of them\nare actually useful. So why would you want to talk to Zahel?”\nHe wasn’t certain he could explain. One of the other swordmasters—or\nlikely any of the ardents who frequented the sparring grounds—could\nindeed answer his questions. But they, like the others, regarded Kaladin\nwith an air of respect and awe. He wanted to talk to someone who would be\ncompletely honest with him.\nHe made his way out to the edge of the tower.

        "text": "completely honest with him.\nHe made his way out to the edge of the tower. Here, open to the sky,\nvarious tiered discs of stone projected from the base of the structure like\nenormous fronds. Over the last year, a number of these had been turned into\npastures for chulls, lobberbeasts, or horses. Others were hung with lines for\ndrying wash. Kaladin started toward the drying wash, but paused—then\ndecided to make a short detour.\nNavani and her scholars claimed that these outer plates around the tower\nhad once been fields. How could that ever have been the case? The air up\nhere was cold, and though Rock seemed to find it invigorating, Kaladin\ncould tell it lacked something. He grew winded more quickly, and if he\nexerted himself, he sometimes felt light-headed in ways he never did at\nnormal elevations.\nHighstorms hit here infrequently. Nine out of ten didn’t get high enough\n—passing as an angry expanse below, rumbling their discontent with flashes\nof lightning. Without the storms, there simply wasn’t enough water for\ncrops, let alone proper hillsides for planting polyps.\nStill, at Navani’s urging, the last six months had involved a unique\nproject. For years the Alethi had fought the Parshendi over gemhearts on the\nShattered Plains. It had been a bloody affair built upon the corpses of\nbridgemen whose bodies—more than their tools—spanned the gaps\nbetween plateaus. It shocked Kaladin that so many involved in this\nslaughter had missed asking a specific and poignant question:\nWhy had the Parshendi wanted gemstones?\nTo the Alethi, gemstones were not merely wealth, but power. With a\nSoulcaster, emeralds meant food—highly portable sources of nutrition that\ncould travel with an army. The Alethi military had used the advantage of\nmobile forces without long supply lines to ravage across Roshar during the\nreigns of a half dozen interchangeable kings.\nThe Parshendi hadn’t possessed Soulcasters though. Rlain had confirmed\nthis fact. And then he’d given humankind a gift.\nKaladin walked down a set of stone steps to where a group of farmers\nworked a test field. The flat stone had been spread with seed paste—and that\nhad grown rockbuds. Water was brought from a nearby pump, and Kaladin\npassed bearers lugging bucket after bucket to dump on the polyps and\nsimulate a rainstorm.\nTheir best farmers had explained it wouldn’t work. You could simulate\nthe highstorm minerals the plants needed to form shells, but the cold air\nwould stifle growth. Rlain had agreed this was true … unless you had an\nedge.\nUnless you grew the plants by the light of gemstones.\nThe common field before Kaladin was adorned with a most uncommon\nsight: enormous emeralds harvested from the hearts of chasmfiends,\nensconced within short iron lampposts that were in turn bolted to the stone\nground. The emeralds were so large, and so full of Stormlight, that looking\nat one left spots on Kaladin’s vision, though it was in full daylight.\nBeside each lantern sat an ardent with a drum, softly banging a specific\nrhythm.

        "text": "Beside each lantern sat an ardent with a drum, softly banging a specific\nrhythm. This was the secret. People would have noticed if gemstone light\nmade plants grow—but the mixture of the light and the music changed\nsomething. Lifespren—little green motes that bobbed in the air—spun\naround the drummers. The spren glowed brighter than usual, as if the Light\nof the gemstones was infusing them. And they’d move off to the plants,\nspinning around them.\nThis drained the Light, like using a fabrial did. Indeed, the gemstones\nwould periodically crack, as also happened to fabrials. Somehow, the\nmixture of spren, music, and Light created a kind of organic machine that\nsustained plants via Stormlight.\nRlain, wearing his Bridge Four uniform, walked among the stations,\nchecking the rhythms for accuracy. He usually wore warform these days,\nthough he’d confessed to Kaladin that he disliked how it made him seem\nmore like the invaders, with their wicked carapace armor. That made some\nhumans distrust him. But workform made people treat him like a parshman.\nHe hated that even more.\nThough to be honest, it was odd to see Rlain—with his black and red\nmarbled skin—giving direction to Alethi. It was reminiscent of what was\nhappening in Alethkar, with the invasion. Rlain didn’t like it when people\nmade those kinds of comparisons, and Kaladin tried not to think that way.\nRegardless, Rlain seemed to have found purpose in this work. Enough\npurpose that Kaladin almost left him and continued on his previous task.\nBut no—the days where Kaladin could directly look out for the men and\nwomen of Bridge Four were coming to an end. He wanted to see them cared\nfor.\nHe jogged through the field. While any one of these head-size rockbuds\nwould have been considered too small to be worth much in Hearthstone,\nthey were at least big enough that there would be grain inside. The\ntechnique was helping.\n“Rlain,” Kaladin called. “Rlain!”\n“Sir?” the listener asked, turning and smiling. He hummed a peppy tune\nas he jogged over. “How was the meeting?”\nKaladin hesitated. Should he say it? Or wait? “It had some interesting\ndevelopments. Promotions for Skar and Sigzil.” Kaladin scanned the field.\n“But someone can fill you in on that later. For now, these crops are looking\ngood.”\n“The spren don’t come as readily for humans as they did for the\nlisteners,” he said, surveying the field. “You cannot hear the rhythms. And I\ncan’t get humans to sing the pure tones of Roshar. A few are getting closer\nthough. I’m encouraged.” He shook his head. “Anyway, what was it you\nwanted, sir?”\n“I found you an honorspren.”\nKaladin was accustomed to seeing an unreadable, stoic expression on\nRlain’s marbled face. That melted away like sand before a storm as Rlain\nadopted a wide, face-splitting grin. He grabbed Kaladin by the shoulders,\nhis eyes dancing—and when he hummed, the exultant rhythm to it almost\nmade Kaladin feel he could sense something beyond. A sound as bombastic\nas sunlight, as joyful as a child’s laughter."

A sound as bombastic\nas sunlight, as joyful as a child’s laughter.\n“An honorspren?” Rlain said. “Who is willing to bond with a listener?\nTruly?”\n“Vratim’s old spren, Yunfah. He was delaying choosing someone new, so\nSyl and I gave him an ultimatum: Choose you or leave. This morning, he\ncame to me and agreed to try to bond with you.”\nRlain’s humming softened.\n“It was a gamble,” Kaladin said. “Since I didn’t want to drive him away.\nBut we finally got him to agree. He’ll keep his word; but be careful. I get\nthe sense he’ll take any chance he can to wiggle out of the deal.”\nRlain squeezed Kaladin on the shoulder and nodded to him, a sign of\nobvious respect. Which made the next words he spoke so odd. “Thank you,\nsir. Please tell the spren he can seek elsewhere. I won’t be requiring his\nbond.”\nHe let go, but Kaladin caught his arm.\n“Rlain?” Kaladin said. “What are you saying? Syl and I worked hard to\nfind you a spren.”\n“I appreciate that, sir.”\n“I know you feel left out. I know how hard it is to see the others fly\nwhile you walk. This is your chance.”\n“Would you take a spren who was forced into the deal, Kaladin?” Rlain\nasked.\n“Considering the circumstances, I’d take what I could get.”\n“The circumstances…” Rlain said, holding up his hand, inspecting the\npattern of his skin. “Did I ever tell you, sir, how I ended up in a bridge\ncrew?”\nKaladin shook his head slowly.\n“I answered a question,” Rlain said. “My owner was a mid-dahn\nlighteyes—nobody you’d know. An overseer among Sadeas’s\nquartermasters. He called out to his wife for help as he was trying to add\nfigures in his head, and—not thinking—I gave him the answer.” Rlain\nhummed a soft rhythm, mocking in tone. “A stupid mistake. I’d been\nembedded among the Alethi for years, but I grew careless.\n“Over the next few days, my owner watched me. I thought I’d given\nmyself away. But no … he didn’t suspect I was a spy. He just thought I was\ntoo smart. A clever parshman frightened him. So he offered me up to the\nbridge crews.” Rlain glanced back at Kaladin. “Wouldn’t want a parshman\nlike that breeding, now would we? Who knows what kind of trouble they\nwould make if they started thinking for themselves?”\n“I’m not trying to tell you that you shouldn’t think, Rlain,” Kaladin said.\n“I’m trying to help.”\n“I know you are, sir. But I have no interest in taking ‘what I can get.’\nAnd I don’t think you should force a spren into a bond. It will make for a\nbad precedent, sir.” He hummed a different rhythm. “You all name me a\nsquire, but I can’t draw Stormlight like the rest. There’s a wedge between"

Strange.

He could see the\nman’s point, but to pass up this chance? Maybe the only way to get what\nRlain wanted—respect from a spren—was to start with one who was\nskeptical. And Kaladin hadn’t forced Yunfah. Kaladin had given an order.\nSometimes, soldiers had to serve in positions they didn’t want.\nKaladin hated feeling he’d somehow done something shameful, despite\nhis best intentions. Couldn’t Rlain accept the work he’d put into this effort,\nthen do what he asked?\nOr maybe, another part of him thought, you could do what you promised\nhim—and listen for once.\nKaladin entered the washing field, passing lines of women standing at\ntroughs as if in formation, warring with an unending horde of stained shirts\nand uniform coats. He trailed around the ancient pump, which bled water\ninto the troughs, and through a rippling field of sheets hung on lines like\npale white banners.\nHe found Zahel at the edge of the plateau. This section of the field\noverlooked a steep drop-off. In the near distance, Kaladin could see\nNavani’s large construction hanging from the plateau—the device used to\nraise and lower the Fourth Bridge.\nIt seemed like falling from here would leave one to fall for eternity.\nThough he knew the mountain must slope down there somewhere, clouds\noften obscured the drop. He preferred to think of Urithiru as if it were\nfloating, separated from the rest of the world and the agonies it suffered.\nHere, at the outermost of the drying lines, Zahel was carefully hanging\nup a series of brightly colored scarves. Which lighteyes had pressed him\ninto laundering those? They seemed the sort of frivolous neckpieces the\nmore lavish among the elite used to accent their finery.\nIn contrast to the fine silk, Zahel was like the pelt of some freshly killed\nmink. His breechtree cotton robe was old and worn, his beard untamed—\nlike a patch of grass growing freely in a nook sheltered from the wind—and\nhe wore a rope for a belt.\nZahel was everything Kaladin’s instincts told him to avoid. One learned\nto evaluate soldiers by the way they kept their uniforms. A neatly pressed\ncoat would not win you a battle—but the man who took care to polish his\nbuttons was often also the man who could hold a formation with precision.\nSoldiers with scraggly beards and ripped clothing tended to be the type who\nspent their evenings in drink rather than caring for their equipment.\nDuring the years of the Sadeas/Dalinar divide in the warcamps, these\ndistinctions had become so stark they’d practically been banners.

The swordmaster\nwas among the best duelists Kaladin had ever seen, and possessed a wisdom\ndistinct from any other ardent’s or scholar’s. The only explanation was that\nZahel dressed this way on purpose to give a misleading air. Zahel was a\nmasterpiece painting intentionally hung in a splintered frame.\nKaladin halted a respectful distance away. Zahel didn’t look at him, but\nthe strange ardent always seemed to know when someone was approaching.\nHe had a surreal awareness of his surroundings. Syl took off toward him,\nand Kaladin carefully watched Zahel’s reaction.\nHe can see her, Kaladin decided as Zahel carefully hung another scarf.\nHe arranged himself so he could watch Syl from the corner of his eye.\nOther than Rock and Cord, Kaladin had never met a person who could see\ninvisible spren. Did Zahel have Horneater blood? The ability was rare even\namong Rock’s kind—though he had said that occasionally a distant\nHorneater relative was born with it.\n“Well?” Zahel finally asked. “Why have you come to bother me today,\nStormblessed?”\n“I need some advice.”\n“Find something strong to drink,” Zahel said. “It can be better than\nStormlight. Both will get you killed, but at least alcohol does it slowly.”\nKaladin walked up beside Zahel. The fluttering scarves reminded him of\na spren in flight. Syl, perhaps recognizing the same, turned to a similar\nshape.\n“I’m being forced into retirement,” Kaladin said softly.\n“Congratulations,” Zahel said. “Take the pension. Let all this become\nsomeone else’s problem.”\n“I’ve been told I can choose my place moving forward, so long as I’m\nnot on the front lines. I thought…” He looked to Zahel, who smiled,\nwrinkles forming at the sides of his eyes. Odd, how the man’s skin could\nseem smooth as a child’s one moment, then furrow like a grandfather’s the\nnext.\n“You think you belong among us?” Zahel said. “The worn-out soldiers\nof the world? The men with souls so thin, they shiver in a stiff breeze?”\n“That’s what I’ve become,” Kaladin said. “I know why most of them left\nthe battlefield, Zahel. But not you. Why did you join the ardents?”\n“Because I learned that conflict would find men no matter how hard I\ntried,” he said. “I no longer wanted a part in trying to stop them.”\n“But you couldn’t give up the sword,” Kaladin said.\n“Oh, I gave it up. I let go. Best mistake I ever made.” He eyed Kaladin,\nsizing him up. “You didn’t answer my question. You think you belong\namong the swordmasters?”\n“Dalinar offered to let me train new Radiants,” Kaladin said. “I don’t\nthink I could stand that—seeing them fly off to battle without me. But I\nthought maybe I could train regular soldiers again. That might not hurt as\nmuch.”\n“And you think you belong with us?”\n“I … Yes.”\n“Prove it,” Zahel said, snapping a few scarves off the line. “Land a strike\non me.”\n“What? Here? Now?”"

He had no\nweapons that Kaladin could see, though that ragged tan robe might conceal\na knife or two.\n“Hand-to-hand?” Kaladin asked.\n“No, use the sword,” Zahel said. “You want to join the swordmasters?\nShow me how you use one.”\n“I didn’t say…” Kaladin glanced toward the clothing line, where Syl sat\nin the shape of a young woman. She shrugged, so Kaladin summoned her as\na Blade—long and thin, elegant. Not like the oversized slab of a sword\nDalinar had once wielded.\n“Dull the edge, chull-brain,” Zahel said. “My soul might be worn thin,\nbut I’d prefer it remain in one piece. No powers on your part either. I want\nto see you fight, not fly.”\nKaladin dulled Syl’s Blade with a mental command. The edge fuzzed to\nmist, then re-formed unsharpened.\n“Um,” Kaladin said. “How do we start the—”\nZahel whipped a sheet off the line and tossed it toward Kaladin. It\nbillowed, fanning outward, and Kaladin stepped forward, using his sword to\nknock the cloth from the air. Zahel had vanished among the undulating rows\nof sheets.\nCarefully, Kaladin entered the rows. The cloths billowed outward in the\nwind, but then fluttered down, reminiscent of the plants he’d often passed in\nthe chasms. Living things that moved and flowed with the unseen tides of\nthe blowing wind.\nZahel emerged from another row, pulling a sheet off and whipping it out.\nKaladin grunted, stepping away as he swiped at the cloth. That was the\nman’s strategy, Kaladin realized. Keep Kaladin focused on the cloth.\nKaladin ignored the sheet and lunged toward Zahel. He was proud of\nthat strike; Adolin’s instruction with the sword seemed almost as natural to\nhim now as his old spear training. The lunge missed, but the form was\nexcellent.\nZahel, moving with remarkable spryness, dodged back among the rows\nof sheets. Kaladin leaped after him, but again managed to lose his quarry.\nKaladin turned about, searching the seemingly endless rows of fluttering\nwhite sheets. Like dancing flames, pure white.\n“Why do you fight, Kaladin Stormblessed?” Zahel’s phantom voice\ncalled from somewhere nearby.\nKaladin spun, sword out. “I fight for Alethkar.”\n“Ha! You ask me to sponsor you as a swordmaster, then immediately lie\nto me?”\n“I didn’t ask…” Kaladin took a deep breath. “I wear Dalinar’s colors\nproudly.”\n“You fight for him, not because of him,” Zahel called. “Why do you\nfight?”\nKaladin crept in the direction he thought the sound came from. “I fight to\nprotect my men.”\n“Closer,” Zahel said. “But your men are now as safe as they could ever\nbe. They can care for themselves. So why do you keep fighting?”"

Hens from the same nest.”\nA face and figure formed in a nearby sheet, puffing toward Kaladin as if\nsomeone were walking through on the other side. He struck immediately,\ndriving his sword through the sheet. It ripped—the point was still sharp\nenough for that—but didn’t strike anyone beyond.\nSyl momentarily became sharp—changing before he could ask—as he\nswiped to cut the sheet in two. It writhed in the wind, severed down the\ncenter.\nZahel came in from Kaladin’s other side, and Kaladin barely turned in\ntime, swinging his Blade. Zahel deflected the strike with his arm, which\nhe’d wrapped with cloth. In his other hand he carried a long scarf that he\nwhipped forward, catching Kaladin’s off hand and wrapping it with\nshocking tightness, like a coiling whip.\nZahel pulled, yanking Kaladin off balance. Kaladin maintained his feet,\nbarely, and lunged with a one-handed strike. Zahel again deflected the strike\nwith his cloth-wrapped arm. That sort of tactic would never have worked\nagainst a real Shardblade, but it could be surprisingly effective against\nordinary swords. New recruits were often surprised at how well a nice thick\ncloth could stop a blade.\nZahel still had Kaladin’s off hand wrapped in the scarf, which he heaved,\nspinning Kaladin around. Damnation. Kaladin managed to maneuver his\nBlade and slice the cloth in half—Syl becoming sharp for a moment—then\nhe leaped backward and tried to regain his footing.\nZahel strode calmly to the side, whipping his scarf with a solid crack,\nthen spinning it around like a mace. Kaladin didn’t see any Stormlight\ncoming off the ardent, and he had no reason to believe the man could\nSurgebind … but the way the cloth had gripped Kaladin’s arm had been\nuncanny.\nZahel stretched the scarf in his hands—it was longer than Kaladin had\nexpected. “Do you believe in the Almighty, boy?”\n“Why does that matter?”\n“You ask why faith is relevant when you’re considering joining the\nardents—to become a religious advisor?”\n“I want to be a teacher of the sword and spear,” Kaladin said. “What\ndoes that have to do with the Almighty?”\n“All right, then. You ask why God is relevant when you’re considering\nteaching men to kill?”\nKaladin inched carefully forward, his Blade held before him. “I don’t\nknow what I believe. Navani still follows the Almighty. She burns\nglyphwards every morning. Dalinar says that the Almighty is dead, but he\nalso claims there’s another true God somewhere in a place beyond\nShadesmar. Jasnah says that a being having vast powers doesn’t make them\nGod, and concludes—from the way the world works—that an omnipotent,\nloving deity cannot exist.”\n“I didn’t ask what they believe. I asked what you believe.”"

I asked what you believe.”\n“I’m not confident anyone knows the answers. I figure I’ll let the people\nwho care argue about it, and I’ll keep my head down and focus on my life\nright now.”\nZahel nodded to him, as if that answer was acceptable. He waved\nKaladin forward. Trying to keep his sword form in mind—he’d trained\nmostly on Smokestance—Kaladin tested forward. He feinted twice, then\nlunged.\nZahel’s hands became a blur as he pushed the sword to the side with his\nstretched-out scarf, then twisted his hands around, neatly wrapping the scarf\naround the sword. That gave him leverage to push the sword farther away as\nhe stepped into Kaladin’s lunge and slid his makeshift wrapping along the\nlength of the Blade, coming in close.\nHere, he somehow twisted his cloths around to wrap Kaladin’s wrists as\nwell. Kaladin tried a head-butt, but Zahel stepped into the move and raised\none side of the scarf—letting Kaladin’s head go underneath it. With a twirl\nand a twist, Zahel completely tied Kaladin in the scarf. How long was that\nthing?\nThe exchange left Kaladin with not only his hands tied tightly, but a\nscarf now holding his arms pinned to his sides, Zahel standing behind him.\nKaladin couldn’t see what Zahel did next, but it involved sending a loop of\nscarf up over Kaladin’s head and around his neck. Zahel pulled tight,\nchoking off Kaladin’s air.\nI think we’re losing, Syl said. To a guy wielding something he found in\nAdolin’s sock drawer.\nKaladin grunted, but a part of him was excited. Frustrating as Zahel\ncould be, he was an excellent fighter—and he tested Kaladin in ways he’d\nnever seen before. That was the sort of training he needed in order to beat\nthe Fused.\nAs Zahel tried to choke him, Kaladin forced himself to remain calm. He\nchanged Syl into a small dagger. A twist of the wrist cut the scarf, which\nunraveled the entire trap, leaving Kaladin free to spin and slash with his\nagain-dulled knife.\nThe ardent blocked the knife with his cloth-wrapped arm. He\nimmediately caught Kaladin’s wrist with his other hand, so Kaladin\ndismissed Syl and summoned her again with his off hand—swinging to\nmake Zahel dodge back.\nZahel snatched a sheet off the fluttering lines, twisting it and wrapping it\ninto a tight length, like a cord.\nKaladin rubbed his neck. “I think … I think I have seen this style before.\nYou fight like Azure does.”\n“She fights like me, boy.”\n“She’s hunting for you, I think.”\n“So Adolin has said. The fool woman will have to get through\nCultivation’s Perpendicularity first, so I won’t hold my Breaths waiting for\nher to arrive.” He waved for Kaladin to come at him again.\nKaladin slipped a throwing knife from his belt, then fell into a sword-\nand-knife stance.

The\nswordmaster smiled, then threw his sheet at Kaladin. It puffed out,\nspreading wide as if going for an embrace. By the time Kaladin had cut it\ndown, Zahel was gone, ducking out into the rippling cloth forest.\nKaladin dismissed Syl, then waved toward the ground. She nodded and\ndived to look under the sheets, searching for Zahel. She pointed in a\ndirection for Kaladin, then dodged between two sheets as a ribbon of light.\nKaladin followed carefully. He thought he caught a glimpse of Zahel\nthrough the sheets, a shadow across the cloth.\n“Do you believe?” Kaladin asked as he advanced. “In God, or the\nAlmighty or whatever?”\n“I don’t have to believe,” the voice drifted back. “I know gods exist. I\nsimply hate them.”\nKaladin dodged between a pair of sheets. In that moment, sheets began\nripping free of the lines. They sprang for Kaladin, six at once, and he swore\nhe could see the outlines of faces and figures in them. He summoned Syl\nand—keeping his head—ignored the unnerving sight and found Zahel.\nKaladin lunged. Zahel—moving with almost supernatural poise—raised\ntwo fingers and pressed them to the moving Blade, turning the point aside\nexactly enough that it missed.\nThe wind swirled around Kaladin as he stepped into the rippling sheets.\nThey flowed against him—insubstantial—but then entangled his legs. He\ntripped with a curse, falling to the hard stone.\nA second later Zahel had Kaladin’s own knife in hand, pressed to his\nforehead. Kaladin felt the point right among his scars.\n“You cheated,” Kaladin said. “You’re doing something with those sheets\nand that cloth.”\n“I couldn’t cheat,” Zahel said. “This wasn’t about winning or losing,\nboy. It was for me to see how you fought. I can tell more about a man when\nthe odds are against him.”\nZahel stood and dropped the knife with a clang. Kaladin recovered it,\nsitting up, and glanced at the fallen sheets. They lay on the ground—normal\ncloths, occasionally shifting in the breeze. In fact, another man might have\ndismissed their motions as a trick of the wind.\nBut Kaladin knew the wind. That had not been the wind.\n“You can’t join the ardents,” Zahel said to him, kneeling and touching\none of the cloths with his finger, then lifting it and pinning it onto the drying\nline. He did the same for the others, each in turn.\n“Why can’t I?” Kaladin asked. He wasn’t certain Zahel had the authority\nto forbid him, but he also wasn’t certain he wanted to take this path if Zahel\n—the one ardent he felt true respect for—was opposed. “Do you make\neveryone who wants to retire to the ardentia fight you for the privilege?”\n“It wasn’t a fight about winning or losing,” Zahel said. “You’re not\nunwelcome because you lost; you’re unwelcome because you don’t belong\nwith us.” He whipped a sheet in the air, then pinned it in place. “You love"

Not with the Thrill that Dalinar once felt, or even with\nthe anticipation of a dandy going to a duel.\n“You love it because it’s part of you. It’s your mistress, your passion,\nyour lifeblood. You’d find the daily training unsatisfying. You’d thirst for\nsomething more. You’d eventually turn and leave, and that would put you in\na worse position than if you’d never started.”\nHe tossed his scarf at Kaladin’s feet. Though it must have been a\ndifferent scarf, for the one he’d started with had been bright red, and this\none was dull grey.\n“Return when you hate the fight,” Zahel said. “Truly hate it.” He walked\noff between the sheets.\nKaladin picked up the fallen scarf, then glanced at Syl, who descended\nthrough the air near him on an invisible set of steps. She shrugged.\nKaladin gripped the cloth, then strode around the sheets. The\nswordmaster had moved to sit at the rim of the plateau, legs over the edge,\nstaring out across the nearby mountain range. Kaladin dropped the scarf on\na pile of others—each of which was now grey.\n“What are you?” Kaladin asked. “Are you like Wit?” There had always\nbeen something about Zahel, something too knowing. Something distinct,\nset apart, different from the others.\n“No,” Zahel said. “I don’t think there’s anyone else quite like Hoid. I\nknew him by the name Dust when I was younger. I think he must have a\nthousand different names among a thousand different peoples.”\n“And you?” Kaladin settled down on the stone beside Zahel. “How many\nnames do you have?”\n“A few,” Zahel said. “More than I normally share.” He leaned forward,\nelbows on thighs. Wind blew at the hem of his robe, dangling over a drop of\nthousands of feet. “You want to know what I am? Well, I’m a lot of things.\nTired, mostly. But I’m also a Type Two Invested entity. Used to call myself\na Type One, but I had to throw the whole scale out, once I learned more.\nThat’s the trouble with science. It’s never done. Always upending itself.\nRuining perfect systems for the little inconvenience of them being wrong.”\n“I…” Kaladin swallowed. “I don’t know what any of that meant, but\nthanks for replying. Wit never gives me answers. At least not straight ones.”\n“That’s because Wit is an asshole,” Zahel said. He fished in his robe’s\npocket and pulled something out—a small stone in the shape of a curling\nshell. “Ever seen one of these?”\n“Soulcast?” Kaladin asked, taking the small shell. It was surprisingly\nheavy. He turned it around, admiring the way it curled.\n“Similar. That’s a creature that died long, long ago. It settled into the\nmud, and slowly—over thousands upon thousands of years—minerals\ninfused its body, replacing it axon by axon with stone. Eventually the entire\nthing was transformed.”\n“So … natural Soulcasting. Over time.”"

Eventually the entire\nthing was transformed.”\n“So … natural Soulcasting. Over time.”\n“A long time. A mind-numbingly long time. The place I come from, it\ndidn’t have any of these. It’s too new. Your world might have some hidden\ndeep, but I doubt it. That stone you hold is old. Older than Wit, or your\nHeralds, or the gods themselves.”\nKaladin held it up, then—out of habit—used a few drops of water from\nhis canteen to reveal its hidden colors and shades.\n“My soul,” Zahel said, “is like that fossil. Every part of my soul has been\nreplaced with something new, though it happened in a flash for me. The\nsoul I have now resembles the one I was born with, but it’s something else\nentirely.”\n“I don’t understand.”\n“I’m not surprised.” Zahel thought for a moment. “Imagine it this way.\nYou know how you can make an imprint in crem, then let it dry, and fill the\nimprint with wax to create a copy of your original object? Well, that\nhappened to my soul. When I died, I was drenched in power. So when my\nsoul escaped, it left a duplicate. A kind of … fossil of a soul.”\nKaladin hesitated. “You … died?”\nZahel nodded. “Happened to your friend too. Up in the prison? The one\nwith … that sword.”\n“Szeth. Not my friend.”\n“The Heralds too,” Zahel said. “When they died, they left an imprint\nbehind. Power that remembered being them. You see, the power wants to be\nalive.” He gestured with his chin toward Syl, flying down beneath them as a\nribbon of light. “She’s what I now call a Type One Invested entity. I decided\nthat had to be the proper way to refer to them. Power that came alive on its\nown.”\n“You can see her!” Kaladin said.\n“See? No. Sense?” Zahel shrugged. “Cut off a bit of divinity and leave it\nalone. Eventually it comes alive. And if you let a man die with too Invested\na soul—or Invest him right as he’s dying—he’ll leave behind a shadow you\ncan nail back onto a body. His own, if you’re feeling charitable. Once done,\nyou have this.” Zahel waved to himself. “Type Two Invested entity. Dead\nman walking.”\nWhat a … strange conversation. Kaladin frowned, trying to figure out\nwhy Zahel was telling him this. I suppose I did ask. So … Wait. Maybe\nthere was another reason.\n“The Fused?” Kaladin asked. “That’s what they are?”\n“Yeah,” he said. “Most of us stop aging when it happens, gaining a kind\nof immortality.”\n“Is there a … way to kill something like you? Permanently?”\n“Lots of ways. For the weaker ones, just kill the body again, make sure\nno one Invests the soul with more strength, and they’ll slip away in a few\nminutes. For stronger ones … well, you might be able to starve them. A lot\nof Type Twos feed on power. Keeps them going."

Instead of killing them, we could find a way to live with\nthem.”\n“Grand ideals,” Zahel said. “Optimism. Yeah, you’d make a terrible\nswordmaster. Be wary of those Fused, kid.

As Kaladin hiked off, the swordmaster cradled it to his chest,\nstaring out toward the endless horizon.\nMy final point of the evening is a discussion of Fused weapons. The\nFused use a variety of fabrial devices to fight Radiants.

It was\ndifferent from Voidlight. She held up a Voidlight sphere for comparison, a\ndiamond infused with the strange Light gathered during the Everstorm.\nThey still didn’t know how the enemy infused spheres with Voidlight; all\nthey owned were stolen from the singers. Fortunately, Voidlight leaked far\nmore slowly than Stormlight did. She probably had a few more days before\nthis one went dun.\nThe Voidlight sphere had a strange glow to it. A distinctive purple-on-\nblack, which Rushu described as a hyperviolet—a color she claimed existed\nin theory, though Navani didn’t know how a color could be theoretical.\nRegardless, this was a purple-on-black, coexisting in such a way that both\nshades simultaneously occupied the same space.\nThe strange sphere that Szeth had provided seemed exactly the same at\nfirst glance. Purple upon black, an impossible color. Like the ordinary\nVoidlight sphere, its blackness expanded, making the surrounding air dim.\nBut there was an added effect with this sphere, one she hadn’t noticed\nright away. It warped the air around it. Looking at the sphere for too long\nwas a distinctively disorienting sensation.

It evoked a wrongness that she\ncouldn’t define.\nGavilar had possessed Voidlight spheres—she remembered seeing them\n—and that fact was befuddling enough. How had her husband obtained\nVoidlight years before the arrival of the Everstorm? But this other black\nsphere. What on Roshar was it?\n“Assassin,” Navani said. “Look at me.”\nSzeth, the Assassin in White, looked up from within his cell. Sixteen\ndays had passed since Navani and Dalinar had returned from testing the\nFourth Bridge in battle. Sixteen days spent catching up on mundane work\nin the tower, like overseeing planned expansions of the market and dealing\nwith sanitation problems. Only now did she have a large chunk of time to\ndedicate to Voidlight and the nature of the tower.\nThe strange individual who had contacted her via spanreed had not\nspoken to her again. Navani had decided not to worry about them—she\ndidn’t even know if they were sane. She had plenty else to worry about,\nsuch as the man sitting in the prison cell in front of her.\nSzeth cradled his strange Shardblade in his lap, the one that leaked black\nsmoke when unsheathed. When challenged about letting the prisoner remain\narmed, Dalinar had replied, “I believe the safest place to keep the thing is in\nhis possession.”\nNavani questioned that wisdom. In her opinion, they should sink the\nstrange Blade in the ocean, like they’d done with the gemstone that\ncontained the Thrill. Szeth did not seem stable enough to be trusted with a\nShard, particularly not one so dangerous as this. In fact, she wished the\nassassin had been executed as he deserved.\nDalinar disagreed, and so they’d decided together to leave Szeth alive.\nToday, the Shin man sat on the floor of his stone cell, eyes closed, wearing\nwhite clothing by his own request. He had been given what few amenities\nhe asked for. A razor for shaving, a single blanket, a chance to bathe each\nday.\nAnd light. A great deal of light. Dozens of spheres to illuminate his small\nstone cell and banish all traces of shadow.\nThey’d fitted the front of the room with bars, though those wouldn’t\nkeep the assassin contained should he decide to escape. That Shardblade\ncould reduce objects to smoke simply by nicking them.\n“Tell me again,” Navani said to him, “of the night you killed my\nhusband.”\n“I was instructed by the Parshendi to execute him,” Szeth said softly.\n“Were you curious why they’d kill a man on the very night they were\nsigning a peace treaty with him?”\n“I thought I was Truthless,” Szeth said. “That status required that I do as\nmy master commanded. Without question.” His voice bore only the faintest\nhint of an accent.\n“Your master is now Dalinar.”\n“Yes. I have … found a better way. Throughout my Truthless existence, I\nfollowed the way of the Oathstone. I would obey anyone who held that\nstone. Now, I have realized I was never Truthless. I have sworn to an Ideal\ninstead: the Blackthorn. Whatever he wishes, I will make reality.”\n“What if Dalinar dies?”\n“I … will seek another Ideal, I suppose. I had not considered it.”"

I had not considered it.”\n“How could you not think of that?”\n“I simply did not.”\nStorms, this is dangerous, Navani thought. Dalinar could speak of\nredemption and mending broken spirits, but this creature was a fire burning\nunchecked, ready to escape the hearth and consume any fuel it could find.\nSzeth had murdered kings and highprinces—over a dozen rulers all across\nRoshar. Yes, much of that blame fell on Taravangian, but Szeth was the tool\nemployed to cause such destruction.\n“You didn’t finish your story,” Navani said. “The night you killed\nGavilar. Tell me again what happened. The part with this sphere.”\n“We fell,” Szeth whispered, opening his eyes. “Gavilar was injured by\nthe impact, his body fatally broken. In that moment he treated me not as an\nenemy, but as the last living man he would ever see. He made a request. A\nholy request, the last words of the dying.\n“He spoke a few names, which I do not remember, asking if those men\nhad sent me. When I assured him they had not, he was relieved. I think he\nfeared the sphere falling into their hands, so he gave it to me. He trusted his\nown murderer more than those who surrounded him.”\nIncluding me, Navani thought. Storms, she’d assumed she was over her\nanger and frustration with Gavilar, but there it was, twisting around itself in\nthe pit of her stomach, causing angerspren to rise beneath her feet.\n“He told me a message to give his brother,” Szeth continued, his eyes\nflickering toward the pooling angerspren. “I wrote the words, as it was the\nbest I could do to fulfill that dying request. I took the sphere and hid it.\nUntil you asked me if I’d found anything on his body, whereupon I\nrecovered it.”\nThis he’d done only a month ago because Navani had thought to ask the\nquestion. Otherwise he would simply have gone on without saying a word\nof this sphere—as if his mind were too childlike or stressed to realize he\nshould speak up.\nNavani shivered. She was in favor of comforting the sick of mind—once\nthey were carefully contained, and things like evil talking Shardblades were\nremoved from their possession. She had a list of facts she’d collected from\nhim about that Blade, and she thought maybe it was an Honorblade that had\nbeen corrupted somehow. It had been given to Szeth by one of the Heralds,\nafter all. She found it difficult to study, however, because being around\nSzeth made her feel sick.\nAt least the sword’s spren had stopped speaking into the minds of those\nwho passed by the prison. It had taken three demands from Dalinar to get\nSzeth to finally restrain the thing.\n“You’re certain this is the exact sphere he gave you,” Navani said.\n“It is.”\n“And he said nothing about it to you?”\n“I have answered this question.”\n“And you will answer it again. Until I’m certain you haven’t ‘forgotten’\nany more details.”\nSzeth sighed softly. “He did not speak of the sphere. He was dying; he"

He was dying; he\ncould barely force out his last words. I am not certain they are prophetic, as\nthe voices of the dying sometimes are in my land. I followed them anyway.”\nShe turned to go. She had more questions, but she had to budget her time\nwith the assassin. Each moment near him made her feel physically ill; even\nnow her stomach was beginning to churn, and she feared losing her\nbreakfast.\n“Do you hate me?” Szeth asked from behind, calm, almost emotionless.\nToo calm, too emotionless for words spoken to a widow at his hand.\n“Yes,” Navani said.\n“Good,” Szeth said, the word echoing in the small chamber. “Good.\nThank you.”\nShivering and nauseous, Navani fled his presence.\n* * *\nLess than an hour later, she stepped out onto the Cloudwalk, a garden\nbalcony set at the base of the eighth tier of the tower. Urithiru was nearly\ntwo hundred floors tall, ten tiers of eighteen floors each—and so the eighth\ntier was near the top, at a dizzying height.\nMost of the tower was built up against the mountains, with chunks of the\nstructure embedded fully into the stone. It was only here, near the top, that\nthe tower fully peeked up above the surrounding stone. The Cloudwalk\nrounded almost the entire perimeter of the tier, an open stone pathway with\na sure railing on one side.\nIt sported some of the best views Urithiru had to offer. Navani had often\ncome here during their early months in the tower, but news of the\nspectacular views had spread. When once she’d been able to walk the entire\nCloudwalk without encountering another soul, today she was met by the\nsight of tens of people strolling up here.\nShe forced herself to see it as a victory, not an encroachment. Part of\ntheir vision for this tower was a city where the different peoples of Roshar\nintermixed. With the Oathgates providing direct access to cities around the\ncontinent, Urithiru could grow to be cosmopolitan in ways that Kholinar\ncould never have dreamed.\nAs she walked, she saw not only the uniforms of seven different\nprincedoms, but people wearing the patterns of three different Makabaki\nlocal governments. Thaylen merchants, Emuli soldiers, and Natan\ntradesmen were represented. There were even a few Aimians, remnants of\nthe humans who had escaped Aimia, the men with their beards bound in\ncords.\nMost of the world was embroiled in war, but Urithiru stood apart. A\nplace of calm serenity above the storms. Soldiers came here when rotated\noff active duty. Tradesmen brought their wares, enduring wartime tariffs to\navoid the cost of trying to deliver goods across battle lines. Scholars came\nto let their minds spark against those working to solve the problems of a\nnew era. Urithiru was truly something great.\nShe wished Elhokar had lived to see how wonderful it was becoming.\nBest she could do was see that his son grew up to appreciate it.

The nursemaid set\nGavinor down, and he rushed over, jumping into Navani’s embrace.\nShe hung to him tightly, appreciating the progress they’d made. When\nGavinor had finally been recovered, he’d been so frightened and timid he\nhad cringed when Navani tried to hug him. That trauma, now a year past,\nwas finally fading from the boy. He was often solemn—too solemn for a\nboy of five—but at least with her, he’d learned to laugh again.\n“Gram!” he said. “Gram, I rode a horse!”\n“All on your own?” she asked, lifting him.\n“Adolin helped me!” he said. “But it was a big horse, and I wasn’t\nscared, even when it started walking! Look! Look!” He pointed, and she\nlifted him up as they peered toward the fields far below. It was too far to\nmake out details, but that didn’t stop little Gav from explaining to her—at\nlength—the different colors of horses he’d seen.\nShe gave him an encouraging smile. His excitement was not only\ninfectious, it was relieving. During his first few months in the tower, he’d\nhardly spoken. Now, his willingness to do more than barely go near the\nhorses—which fascinated him, but also terrified him—was a huge\nimprovement.\nShe held Gav, warm despite the chill air, as he talked. The child was still\nfar too small for his age, and the doctors weren’t certain if something\nstrange had been done to him during his time in Kholinar. Navani was\nfurious at Aesudan for all that had happened there—but equally furious at\nherself. How much was Navani to blame for leaving the woman alone to\ninvite in one of the Unmade?\nYou couldn’t have known, Navani told herself. You can’t be to blame for\neverything. She’d tried to overcome those feelings—and the equally\nirrational ones that whispered she shared blame for Elhokar’s death. If she’d\nstopped him from going on that fool’s mission …\nNo. No, she would hold Gav, she would hurt, but she would move\nforward. She pointedly thought on her wonderful moments holding Elhokar\nas a little boy, not fixating on the idea of that little boy dying to a traitor’s\nspear.\n“Gram?” Gav asked as they looked out over the mountains. “I want\nGrampa to teach me the sword.”\n“Oh, I’m certain he can get to that eventually,” Navani said, then\npointed. “See that cloud! It’s so huge!”\n“Other boys my age learn the sword,” Gav said, his voice growing softer.\n“Don’t they?”\nThey did. In Alethkar, families—particularly lighteyed ones—would go\nto war together. The Azish thought it unnatural, but to the Alethi it was the\nway of things. Children as young as ten would learn to serve as officers’\naides, and boys would often be given a training sword as soon as they could\nwalk.\n“You don’t need to worry about that,” Navani said to him."

I’ll be\nable to find the man who killed my father. And I could kill him.”\nNavani felt a chill unrelated to the cold air. On one hand, it was a very\nAlethi thing to say. It broke her heart regardless. She hugged Gav tight.\n“Don’t worry about it.”\n“Will you talk to Grampa, please?”\nShe sighed. “I’ll ask him.”\nGav nodded, smiling. Her time with him was short, unfortunately. She\nhad a meeting with Dalinar and Jasnah in under an hour, and she needed to\ncheck with some scientists up here on the Cloudwalk first. So, she\neventually turned Gav back over to the nursemaid. Then she wiped her\neyes, feeling silly at crying over something so trivial, and hurried on her\nway.\nIt was just that … Elhokar had been learning so much. During these last\nyears, she’d seen him growing into something great—a better man than\nGavilar, worthy of the kingship. A mother should never have to grieve for\nher children. Should never have to think of her poor little boy, lying alone\nand dead on the floor of an abandoned palace …\nShe forced herself forward, nodding to those soldiers who chose to bow\nor—oddly—salute her, hands to shoulders with the knuckles out. Soldiers\nthese days. She supposed with some of their commanders learning to read\nand some of their sisters joining the Radiants, life could get confusing.\nShe eventually reached the research station set up at the far end of the\nCloudwalk. The head scientist in charge of atmospheric measurements was\nan ardent with a particularly long neck. With his bald head and the sagging\nskin under his chin, Brother Benneh resembled nothing so much as an eel\nwho had put on robes and grown a pair of arms through sheer\ndetermination. But he was a happy fellow, and he spryly bounced over to\nher with his notebooks.\n“Brightness!” he said, pointedly ignoring Elthebar the stormwarden, who\nwas taking his own measurements from the nearby instruments. “Look here,\nlook here!”\nBenneh pointed out the historical barometer readings he’d recorded in\nhis notebook. “Here, here,” he said, tapping the barometer—which was set\nup on a scientific table with thermometers, some plants, a sundial, and a\nsmall astrolabe. That was in addition to the various astrological nonsenses\nthe stormwardens had erected.\n“It rises,” Benneh said, almost breathless, “ahead of a storm.”\n“Wait. The barometer rises ahead of a storm?”\n“Yes.”\n“That’s … backward, isn’t it?”\n“Yes indeed, indeed. And see, the temperature readings before a storm\nrise slightly too. You wondered how much colder it was up here on the\nCloudwalk than it was below near the fields. Brightness, it’s warmer.”\nShe frowned, then glanced toward the promenading people.

Besides, she\nalways left the interior of the tower to come out; it was impossible not to\ncompare it to the warmth inside instead of the temperature below.\n“How cold is it right now?” she asked. “Down below?”\n“I asked via spanreed. Measurements are conclusive. At least five\ndegrees colder on the plateau.”\nFive degrees? Storms. “Heat in front of a storm and a rise in pressure,”\nNavani said. “It defies our understanding, but has anyone done readings like\nthis from such an elevation? Perhaps what is natural near sea level is\ninverted up here.”\n“Yes, yes,” the ardent said. “I could perhaps see that, but look at these\nbooks. They contradict such a theory. Measurements taken from various\nHorneater trading expeditions … Let me find them…”\nHe started digging through papers, though she didn’t need them. She had\na suspicion of what was happening. Why would pressure and temperature\nrise before a storm? Because the structure was bracing itself. The tower\ncould adapt to the storms. More proof; the data was growing as\nmountainous as these peaks. The tower could regulate temperature,\npressure, humidity. If Urithiru could be made fully functional, life up here\nwould improve dramatically.\nBut how to fix it, when the spren that had lived here was supposedly\ndead? She was so absorbed by the problem, she nearly missed the bowing.\nHer subconscious initially assumed the bows were for her, but too many\npeople were involved. And they were going too low.\nShe turned to find Dalinar passing by, Taravangian at his side. People\nbacked out of the way before the two kings, and Navani felt like a fool.\nShe’d known they were meeting this afternoon, and this was one of their\nfavorite places to promenade. Others found it encouraging to see the two\nkings together, but Navani did not miss the gap between them. She knew\nthings others did not. For instance, Dalinar no longer met his former friend\nbeside the hearth to chat for hours. And Taravangian no longer attended\nprivate meetings of Dalinar’s inner circle.\nThey hadn’t been able—nor were they yet willing—to excise\nTaravangian from the coalition of monarchs. His crimes, though terrible,\nwere no more bloody than Dalinar’s own. The fact that Taravangian had\nsent Szeth against the Azish emperors had certainly strained relations and\nincreased tensions within the coalition. But for now, they all agreed that the\nservants of Odium were a far more pressing enemy.\nTaravangian, however, would never again be a man to trust. At least\nDalinar’s terrible actions had been part of an official act of war.\nThough … she had to admit some moral high ground had been lost upon\nthe early circulations of Dalinar’s memoir. The Kholin troops—once so\nproud, they’d bordered on imperious—walked with slightly slumped\nshoulders, their heads no longer held quite as high. Everyone had known\nabout the atrocities of the Kholin unification war. They’d heard of the\nBlackthorn’s fearsome reputation, and of cities burned and pillaged."

They’d heard of the\nBlackthorn’s fearsome reputation, and of cities burned and pillaged.\nSo long as Dalinar had been willing to pretend his actions had been\nnoble, the kingdom could pretend along with him. Now the Alethi had to\nface the truth long tucked away behind justifications and political spin. No\narmy, no matter how clean its reputation, walked away from war untainted.\nAnd no leader, no matter how noble, could help but sink into the crem when\nhe stepped into the game of conquest.\nShe spent a little longer going over readings with Benneh, then checked\non the royal astronomers, who were erecting a new set of telescopes made\nwith the highest-quality lenses out of Thaylenah. They were certain they’d\nbe able to get some spectacular views from up here once the telescopes\nwere calibrated. Navani asked the women a few questions as they worked,\nbut left when she felt she was becoming a bother. A true patron of the\nsciences knew when she was hindering instead of helping.\nAs she turned to leave, however, Navani paused—then dug Szeth’s\nstrange Voidlight sphere from her pocket. “Talnah?” she asked one of the\nengineers. “You were a jeweler, weren’t you? Before taking up lens work?”\n“Still am, some seasons,” the short woman replied. “I put in a few hours\nat the mint last week, checking sphere weights.”\n“What do you think of this?” Navani said, holding up the sphere.\nTalnah tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and took the sphere,\nholding it up in a gloved hand. “What is this? Voidlight?” She searched in\nher jacket pocket and pulled out a jeweler’s loupe, then pressed it to her\neye.\n“We’re not sure,” Navani said.\n“Stormfather,” the woman said. “That’s a nice diamond. Hey, Nem!\nHave a look.”\nAnother of the engineers came over and accepted the sphere and loupe,\nwhistling softly. “I have a higher magnification in my bag over there,” she\nsaid, waving, and an assistant engineer helpfully fetched a larger\nmagnifying device, one you could look through with both eyes.\n“What is it?” Navani asked. “What do you see?”\n“Practically flawless,” Nem said, clamping the sphere in some small\ngrips. “This wasn’t grown as a gemheart, I can tell you that. The structure\nwould never align so perfectly. This sphere is worth thousands, Brightness.\nIt will probably hold Stormlight for months without leaking any out. Maybe\nyears. Longer, for Voidlight.”\n“It was left in a cave for over six years,” Navani said. “And was glowing\n—or whatever you call that blackness—the same when it was retrieved.”\n“Quite strange indeed,” Talnah said. “What an odd sphere, Brightness.\nThat must be Voidlight, but it feels wrong. I mean, it’s black-violet like\nothers I’ve seen, but…”\n“The air warps around it,” Navani said.\n“Yeah!” Talnah said. “That’s it. How strange. Can we keep it to study\nit?”\nNavani hesitated.

She’d planned to do her own tests on the sphere, but\nshe had to see to the needs of the tower and work on new iterations of her\nflying machine. To be honest, she’d been planning to run tests on this\nsphere ever since she’d received it—but there was never enough time.\n“Yes, please do,” Navani said. “Run some standard Stormlight\nmeasuring tests for luminosity and the like, then see if you can move the\nLight to other gemstones. If you can, try to use it to power various fabrials.”\n“Voidlight doesn’t work on fabrials,” Nem said, frowning. “But you’re\nright—maybe this isn’t Voidlight. It certainly does look strange.…”\nNavani made them promise to keep the sphere hidden and to reveal the\nresults of their tests only to her. She gave them leave to requisition several\nreal Voidlight spheres, captured in battle, to use in comparisons. Then she\nleft the strange sphere with them, feeling agitated. Not because she didn’t\ntrust the two—they dealt with extremely expensive and delicate equipment,\nand had proven reliable. But the piece of Navani hoping to study this sphere\nherself was disappointed.\nUnfortunately, this was work for scholars. Not her. She left it in their\ncapable hands, and moved on. She was therefore the first to arrive in the\nsmall windowless chamber near the top of the tower where Jasnah and\nDalinar held their private meetings. These top floors were small enough to\ncontrol entirely, with guard posts to regulate access.\nToo often down below, rooms and hallways felt oppressive. As if\nsomething was watching. Openings in walls—running as air ducts through\nthe rooms—often led in bizarre patterns barely mapped by the children\nthey’d sent to crawl through them. You could never be completely certain\nthat someone wasn’t listening at an opening nearby, eavesdropping on\nprivate conversations.\nUp here though, the floors often had a dozen or fewer rooms—all\ncarefully mapped and tested for acoustics. Most had windows, which made\nthem feel inviting. She felt lighter even in a windowless stone chamber like\nthis one, so long as her mind knew open sky was right beyond the wall.\nAs she waited, Navani puttered in her notebooks, theorizing about\nGavilar’s dark sphere. She flipped to a testimonial she’d transcribed from\nRlain, the listener member of Bridge Four. He swore that Gavilar had given\nhis general, Eshonai, a Voidlight sphere years before the coming of the\nEverstorm. When Navani showed him this second sphere, his reaction had\nbeen curious.\nI don’t know what that is, Brightness, he’d said. But it feels painful.\nVoidlight is dangerously inviting, like if I touched it, my body would drink it\nin eagerly. That thing … is different. It has a song I’ve never heard, and it\nvibrates wrong against my soul.\nShe flipped to another page and wrote some thoughts.

The short Herdazian\ndidn’t wear a uniform, merely some common trousers and a buttoned shirt\ncut after simple Herdazian styles, with suspenders and a loose coat. How\nodd. Didn’t he know he wasn’t a refugee any longer?\n“… think you could teach me?” Shallan was saying. Red hair and no hat.\n“I really want to know how you got out of those cuffs.”\n“There’s an art to it,” the general said. “It’s more than practice; it’s about\ninstinct. Each set of confines is a puzzle to be solved, and your reward?\nGoing where you shouldn’t. Being what you shouldn’t. Brightness, it is not\na particularly seemly hobby for a well-connected young woman.”\n“Trust me,” she said, “I am anything but well-connected. I keep finding\npieces of myself lying around, forgotten.…”\nShe led the Mink over to the other door to point out the guard post\nbeyond. Adolin gave Navani a hug, then took the seat next to her.\n“She’s fascinated by him,” he whispered to Navani. “I should have\nguessed she would be.”\n“What’s that clothing he’s wearing?” Navani whispered.\n“I know, I know.” Adolin grimaced. “I offered him my tailors, said we’d\nget him a Herdazian uniform. He said, ‘There is no Herdaz anymore.\nBesides, a man in uniform can’t go the places I like to go.’ I don’t know\nwhat to make of him.”\nAcross the small room, the Mink glanced at one of the stone air vents,\nnodding as Shallan explained the room’s security.\n“He’s plotting how to sneak away,” Adolin said with a sigh, putting his\nfeet up on the table. “He lost us five times today. I can’t decide if he’s\nparanoid, crazy, or merely has a cruel sense of humor.” He leaned toward\nNavani. “I suspect it wouldn’t have been that bad if Shallan hadn’t been so\nimpressed the first time. He does like to show off.”\nNavani eyed Adolin’s new gold-trimmed boots. They were the third pair\nshe’d seen him wearing this week.\nDalinar arrived, depositing two bodyguards outside the front door. He\nkept trying to get Navani to accept some guards of her own, and she always\nagreed—when she had equipment she needed carried. And honestly, Dalinar\ncouldn’t complain. How often had he ditched his own guards?\nThe room had been set up with a few chairs and only one small table, the\none Adolin had his boots on. That boy. He never leaned back in his chair or\nput his feet up when he was wearing ordinary shoes.\nDalinar passed by, rapping the boots with his knuckles. “Decorum,” he\nsaid. “Discipline. Dedication.”"

I\nthought we were saying random words that start with the same sound.”\nDalinar glowered at Shallan.\n“What?” she said.\n“He was never like this before you arrived,” Dalinar said.\n“Stormfather help us,” Shallan said lightly, sitting beside her husband\nand laying a protective hand upon his knee. “A Kholin has learned to relax\nonce in a while? Surely the moons will stop orbiting and the sun will come\ncrashing down.”\nNeither Shallan nor Dalinar would admit to squabbling over Adolin—\nindeed, Navani suspected Dalinar would insist he approved of the marriage.\nBut he’d also never needed to give up one of his children to the influence of\nan outsider. Navani felt Dalinar blamed Shallan too much for the changes in\nthe boy. Shallan wasn’t pushing him to be something he was not; more, he\nfinally felt free enough to explore an identity that wasn’t tied to being the\nBlackthorn’s son.\nAdolin was highprince now. He should have the opportunity to define\nwhat that meant for him.\nFor his part, Adolin just laughed. “Shallan, you’re really complaining\nthat someone is too intense? You? Even your jokes sometimes feel like a\ncompetition.”\nShe glanced to him, then—instead of being provoked—seemed to relax.\nAdolin had that effect on people.\n“Of course they are,” she said. “My life is a constant struggle against\nboredom. If I relax my guard, you’ll find me knitting or something dreadful\nlike that.”\nThe Mink watched the exchange with a smile. “Ah … reminds me of my\nown son and his wife.”\n“I should hope,” Dalinar said, “they are a little less frivolous.”\n“They’re dead, in the war,” the Mink said softly.\n“I’m sorry,” Dalinar said. “The Everstorm and Odium have cost us all\nmuch.”\n“Not that war, Blackthorn.” The Mink gave him a look laden with\nimplication. Then he turned toward Navani. “The highprince mentioned\nmaps for me to inspect? He said they’d be waiting, but I don’t see any in\nhere, nor a table of proper size to roll them out upon. Should we fetch\nthem? I’m very curious to see your troop layouts against the Voidbringers.”\n“We don’t use the term ‘Voidbringers’ anymore,” Dalinar said. “It has\nproven to be … imprecise. We call our enemies the singers. As for the map,\nit’s right here.” He looked to Shallan, who nodded, taking in a breath of\nStormlight from the spheres in her satchel. Navani hurried to prepare her\nnotebook.\nTogether, Shallan and Dalinar summoned the map.\nThe simplest Fused weapon against us isn’t truly a fabrial, but instead\na metal that is extremely light and can withstand the blows of a\nShardblade.

Dalinar breathed out his own Light, which melded with Shallan’s,\nspiraling across the surface like a whirlpool. The two planes of luminescent\nsmoke spun outward, flat and round, filling the room at about waist height.\nSomehow Shallan’s Lightweaving mixed with Dalinar’s Connection to\nthe land to create this magnificent representation of Roshar. The\nStormfather implied that Dalinar—as a Bondsmith—could do similar\nmarvels with other orders, but so far their experiments had been fruitless.\nThe map’s sudden appearance caused the Mink to scramble away. He\nwas at the door in a fraction of a second, standing with it cracked, ready to\nflee. He was a paranoid type, wasn’t he?\nNavani focused on the map, her pen poised. Could she sense anything?\nPerhaps Shadesmar? No … something else. The sensation of flight, soaring\nabove a tempestuous ocean, free. Dreamlike. The Light seemed to become\nsolid, snapping into the shape of a map of the continent as if seen from high\nabove. Fully rendered in color, it showed mountains and valleys in exacting\ntopographical detail, all to scale.\nThe Mink’s eyes went wide, and awespren burst above him like a ring of\nsmoke. Navani understood that emotion. Watching the Radiants work was\nlike experiencing the intensity of the sun or the majesty of a mountain. Yes,\nit was becoming commonplace to her, but she doubted it would ever\nbecome common.\nThe Mink shut the door with a click, then stepped over to reach a hand\ninto the illusion. A small portion of it wavered and swirled into misty\nStormlight. He cocked his head, then walked into the center of the map,\nwhich distorted around him, then snapped back into focus after he stilled.\n“By Kalak’s mighty breath,” the Mink said, leaning over to inspect a\nminiature mountain. “This is incredible.”\n“The combined powers of a Lightweaver and a Bondsmith,” Dalinar\nsaid. “It is not a picture of the world as it exists at this moment,\nunfortunately. We update the map every few days when the highstorm\nblows through. This limits our ability to count enemy troop numbers, since\nthey tend to move inside for the storm.”\n“The map gets that detailed?” the Mink asked. “You can see\nindividuals?”\nDalinar waved, and a portion of the map expanded.

The Azish capital expanded from a dot to a full-sized city,\nthen stopped at its best magnification: a scale where buildings were the size\nof spheres and people were specks.\nDalinar zoomed the map back out to full size and glanced to Shallan. She\nnodded, and numbers began to hover in the air above portions of the map—\nswirling and made from Stormlight, marked by glyphs that men could read.\n“These are our best estimates of troop numbers,” Dalinar said. “Singer\ncounts in gold, our troop counts—which of course are more accurate—in\nthe color of the appropriate army. Divided by glyph, you’ll find foot\nsoldiers, heavy infantry, archers, and what few cavalry we can likely field in\neach area.”\nThe Mink walked through the map and Navani tracked him with her\neyes, more interested in him than the numbers. The Mink took his time,\ninspecting each region of Roshar and its troop concentrations.\nAs he was thus surveying, the door opened. Navani’s daughter—Her\nMajesty Queen Jasnah Kholin of Alethkar—had arrived. She had four\nguards; Jasnah never went about alone, though she was more capable with\nher powers than any other Radiant. She deposited the guards outside the\ndoor and entered with only one man shadowing her: the Queen’s Wit, tall\nand lanky, with jet-black hair and an angular face.\nIt was the same Wit who had served Elhokar, so Navani had known this\nman for a few years. Yet he was … different now. Navani often noted him\nand Jasnah whispering in conspiratorial tones during meetings. He treated\nNavani—and, well, everyone—as if he knew them intimately. There was a\nmystery about this Wit that Navani had never noticed during Elhokar’s\nreign. Perhaps he molded himself to the monarch he served.\nHe stayed in step right behind Jasnah, silvery-sheathed sword on his hip,\nhis lips drawn ever so slightly to a smile. The type that made you think he\nmust be considering a joke about you that no one had the decency to say to\nyour face.\n“I see we have our map,” Jasnah said. “And our new general.”\n“Indeed,” said the Mink, who was reading the troop numbers over Azir.\n“Thoughts?” Jasnah asked, ever practical.\nThe Mink continued his inspection. Navani tried to guess what\nconclusions he’d draw. The war was happening on two main fronts. In\nMakabak—the region encompassing Azir and the many small kingdoms\nsurrounding it—coalition forces continued to battle the singers over a\nspecific region, the kingdom of Emul. The drawn-out conflicts were only\nthe newest in a series of wars that had left the kingdom—once proud—war-\ntorn and broken.\nSo far, neither side had an advantage. Azish armies, with the help of\nAlethi strategists, had recaptured some ground in northern Emul.

A man they now knew was Ishar, the ancient\nHerald gone mad.\nTezim had been quiet lately, unfortunately. Dalinar had hoped he would\nrage against the rear lines of the singers, forcing them to fight pressed\nbetween two armies. As it stood, the brutal fighting in Emul continued at a\nstandstill. The coalition could easily resupply its lines through the Oathgate\nto the north and Thaylen shipping to the south. The enemy had vast\nnumbers of former parshmen and access to larger numbers of irregulars—\nFused, in this case.\nThe Mink took in the details of this battlefront, studying the shipping\nand navy numbers with interest. “You control the entire Southern Depths?”\nhe asked.\n“The enemy has a navy, stolen from Thaylenah,” Jasnah said. “We have\nonly the ships that we’ve managed to build since then, and the ones that\nescaped that fate. So our continued dominance is not assured. But following\na singular victory by Fen’s navy four months ago, the enemy retreated their\nships into Iriali waters to the far northwest. Currently, they seem content to\ncontrol the northern seas while we control the south.”\nThe Mink nodded and moved to the east, inspecting the second of the\nwar’s two battlefronts: the line between Alethkar and Jah Keved. Here,\nNavani’s captured homeland made a secure staging base for the enemy, who\nfought the coalition forces led by Taravangian and Dalinar.\nFighting on this front had mostly been skirmishes along the border. The\nFused had so far refused to be caught in any traditional large-scale battles—\nand much of the border between Alethkar and Jah Keved was difficult\nterrain, making it easy for roving bands on both sides to raid and then\nvanish.\nDalinar felt that the coalition would soon need to make a large offensive.\nNavani agreed. The protracted nature of this war gave the advantage to the\nenemy. The coalition’s Radiant numbers were increasing slowly now,\nparticularly with the honorspren withholding their support. However, the\nenemy singers—once untrained—were growing into better troops by the\nday, and more and more Fused were appearing. Dalinar wanted to push into\nAlethkar and seize the capital.\nThe Mink trailed through the illusory mountains along the Alethi border.\nSo far, other than raids, Dalinar had focused on seizing control of the\nsouthwestern corner of Alethkar—the part that touched the Tarat Sea—to\nreinforce the coalition’s naval superiority in the south. The close proximity\nof Jah Keved—and the Oathgate in Vedenar—allowed them to field troops\nhere with quick resupply.\nIt was the sole part of Alethkar they’d reclaimed so far. And it was a\nlong, long way from the capital of Kholinar. Something had to be done.\nEach day their homeland remained in the enemy’s hands was another day\nfor the people there to be beaten down, controlled.

They’d lost their\nnation, and Dalinar—she knew—blamed himself. He thought if he’d been\nable to quash the squabbling highprinces and finish the war at the Shattered\nPlains, Alethkar would not have fallen.\n“Yes…” the Mink said, squinting at the numbers of Alethi troops near\nthe ocean in southern Alethkar, then glancing back at the Veden armies\nmanning the border. “Yes. Tell me, why do you show me this? This\nintelligence is precious. You trust me quickly.”\n“We don’t have much choice,” Jasnah said, causing him to turn toward\nher. “Have you followed the recent histories of Alethkar and Jah Keved,\nGeneral?”\n“I have had my own troubles,” he said, “but yes. Civil war in both\ncountries.”\n“Ours was not a civil war,” Dalinar said.\nThat was debatable. The rivalry with Sadeas, the contest on the Shattered\nPlains, the eventual turning of Amaram …\n“Regardless of what you term it,” Jasnah said, “the last few years have\nbeen painful for our two kingdoms. Jah Keved lost practically its entire\nroyal family—and most of its best generals—following the assassination of\ntheir king. We didn’t fare much better. Our command staff has been gutted\nseveral times over.”\n“We are spread thin,” Dalinar said. “Many of our best field generals are\nneeded in Azir. When I heard we had a chance to rescue the man who\nsingle-handedly held off the singer invasion for a year…”\nDalinar strode into the middle of the illusion, and it treated him\ndifferently—in subtle ways—from others. The color swirled near him, but\nthe threads of Stormlight reached out, connecting to him. Like the arms of\npetitioners reaching toward their king.\n“I want to know what you see,” Dalinar said, sweeping his hand over the\nmap. “I want your analysis on what we’re doing. I want your help. In\nexchange, we will use our forces to recover Herdaz. Help me retake\nAlethkar, and I will spare no effort in seeing your people freed.”\n“Having the Blackthorn on my side would be novel,” the Mink said.\n“Before I make any promises though, tell me why you have so many troops\nstationed here, here, and here.” He pointed at several fortifications on the\nsouthern border of Alethkar, near the ocean.\n“We need to hold the ports,” Dalinar said.\n“Hmm. Yes, I assume that excuse works for the others in your\ncoalition?”\nDalinar drew his lips to a line, glancing at Jasnah. Behind her, Wit raised\nboth eyebrows and leaned against the far wall. He was uncharacteristically\nquiet in meetings—but one could read entire strings of mockery in his\nexpressions.\n“The enemy concentrations are here, across the river,” the Mink said,\npointing. “If you were truly concerned only with them, you’d fortify"

Curious. Of course, you’d be exposed from behind. It’s almost\nlike you don’t trust the one watching your back.…”\nThe much shorter man met Dalinar’s gaze and left the words hanging in\nthe air. Wit coughed into his hand.\n“I believe Taravangian is working for the enemy,” Dalinar said, with a\nsigh. “One year ago, someone let enemy troops in to attack Urithiru, and—\ndespite excuses and deflections that have convinced the others—I am\ncertain Taravangian’s Radiant was the one who did it.”\n“Dangerous,” the Mink said, “fighting in a war where your strongest ally\nis also your greatest fear. And Radiants, serving the other side? How could\nthis be?”\n“They wouldn’t be the only ones, unfortunately,” Jasnah said. “We’ve\nlost one entire order, the Skybreakers, to the enemy—and they have been\nharrying Azir, requiring us to keep dedicating forces in that region. The\nDustbringers continue to flirt with rebellion, often ignoring Dalinar’s\norders.”\n“Troubling,” the Mink said. He walked up along the border of Alethkar,\npassing Jasnah. “You amass here as well. You want to push into your\nhomeland, don’t you? You seek to recapture Kholinar.”\n“Delaying will lose us the war,” Navani said. “The enemy grows in\nstrength each day.”\n“I agree with this assessment,” the Mink said. “But attacking Alethkar?”\n“We want to make a large, powerful offensive,” Dalinar explained. “We\nare trying to persuade the other monarchs to see how vital it is.”\n“Ah…” the Mink said. “Yes, and an outside general—approaching this\nfresh—would be persuasive to them, wouldn’t he?”\n“That’s the hope,” Dalinar said.\n“Yet you couldn’t help trying to predispose me, eh?” the Mink said.\n“You wanted to show this to me early, get me on your side first. Not risk\nany surprises?”\n“We’ve had … enough surprises dropped on us in meetings of the\nmonarchs,” Navani said.\n“I suppose I can’t blame you,” the Mink said. “Nope. No blame. But a\nquestion remains. What do you want from me, you Kholins? Would you\nprefer a reinforcement of what you already want to believe, or do you seek\nthe truth?”\n“I always want the truth,” Dalinar said. “And if you know anything of\nmy niece, you’ll know she has no qualms stating the truth as she sees it.\nRegardless of the consequences.”\n“Yes,” the Mink said, looking at Jasnah. “I know of your reputation,\nYour Majesty. As for the Blackthorn … I would not have believed you two\nyears ago.” The Mink lifted his finger. “Then my niece read to me your\nbook. The whole thing, yes. We got a copy, which was difficult, and I\nlistened with much interest. I do not trust the Blackthorn, but perhaps I can"

I do not trust the Blackthorn, but perhaps I can\ntrust the man who would write the words you did.”\nHe studied Dalinar, as if weighing him. Then the Mink turned and strode\nacross the map. “I can perhaps help you escape this mess. You must not\nattack Alethkar.”\n“But—” Dalinar began.\n“I agree you need to make an offensive,” the Mink said. “However, if\nTaravangian is not trustworthy, an expedition into Alethkar now would\nexpose your forces to catastrophe. Even without the danger of betrayal, the\nenemy is too strong in the area. I’ve spent time fighting them; I can tell you\nthat their footing is sure in your country. We won’t push them out easily,\nand we certainly can’t do it while prosecuting a two-front war.”\nThe Mink stopped in Azir, then pointed toward the fighting in Emul.\n“Here, you have the enemy pinned between you and a rival force. They’re\nusing those Skybreakers to distract you from how exposed they are here.\nYour enemy is landlocked, with serious supply troubles, isolated from its\nallies in Iri and Alethkar. You want a big offensive that has a chance to\nwork? Reclaim Emul, push the Voidbringers—the singers—out of\nMakabak.\n“You need to consolidate, focus on where the enemy is weakest. You do\nnot need to smash your armies into the most fortified enemy position in a\nreckless attempt to satisfy your wounded Alethi pride. That is the truth.”\nNavani looked at Dalinar, hating the way the words made him deflate,\nhis shoulders slouching. He wanted so badly to free his homeland.\nShe was not the tactical genius Dalinar was. She would not have\nobjected if he’d insisted that freeing Alethkar was the correct move. But the\nway he turned—bowing his head as the Mink spoke—told her he knew the\nMink was right.\nPerhaps Dalinar had known it already. Perhaps he’d needed to hear it\nfrom someone else.\n“Let us get you more detailed reports,” Jasnah said. “So you can see if\nthe facts support your instincts, Mink.”\n“Yes, that would be wise,” the Mink said. “Many a locked room reveals\na hidden path to escape, after all.”\n“Adolin, if you would, please?” Jasnah asked. “Yes, and you, Shallan.\nSee our guest to the military briefing chambers and give him access to our\nscribes and any maps from our archive vault. Teshav should be able to\nprovide exact numbers and recent battle data. Study with care, Mink. We\nmeet with the monarchs in a few weeks’ time to discuss our next big\noffensive, and I would have a plan ready.”\nThe Mink bowed to her and retreated with Adolin and Shallan. As soon\nas he was gone—the map collapsing as Shallan left—Jasnah changed\nsubtly. Her face became less of a mask. She didn’t walk with a queenly gait\nas she strode over and settled down at the room’s small table. This was the\nwoman taking off her crown, now that she was with only family."

She couldn’t tell if the rumors about those\ntwo were true or not, and hadn’t felt comfortable asking. Strange, that a\nmother should feel so unwilling to chat with her daughter about intimate\nmatters. But … well, that was Jasnah.\n“I was worried about this,” Dalinar said, taking a seat opposite Jasnah at\nthe table. “I need to persuade him that the battle must push toward\nAlethkar.”\n“Uncle,” Jasnah said, “are you going to be stubborn about this?”\n“Maybe,” he said.\n“He saw it almost immediately,” Jasnah said. “Taravangian must know\nwe don’t trust him. We can’t strike into Alethkar right now. It hurts me as\nmuch as it does you, but…”\n“I know,” Dalinar said, as Navani sat next to him and put her hand on his\nshoulder. “But I have this terrible feeling, Jasnah. It whispers that there is\nno way to win this war. Not against an immortal enemy. I worry about\nlosing, but I worry more about something else. What do we do if we force\nthem out of Azir, and they agree to cease hostilities? Would we give up\nAlethkar, if it meant ending the war?”\n“I don’t know,” Jasnah said. “That seems to be putting our chulls to work\nbefore we’ve bought them. We don’t know if such a compromise as you\nsuggest is possible.”\n“It wouldn’t be,” Wit said.\nNavani frowned, glancing toward the man, who sipped his wine. He\nwalked over and absently handed Jasnah a cup, his beak of a nose hidden in\nhis own cup as he tipped it back.\n“Wit?” Dalinar asked. “Is this one of your jokes?”\n“Odium is a punch line, Dalinar, but not to any joke you’ve been told.”\nWit sat with them at the table, not asking permission. He always acted as if\ndining with kings and queens was his natural state. “Odium will not\ncompromise. He will not settle for anything other than our complete\nsubmission, perhaps destruction.”\nDalinar frowned, then glanced to Navani. She shrugged. Wit often spoke\nlike that, as if he knew things he shouldn’t. They couldn’t tell whether he\nwas pretending or serious—but pressing him usually merely got you\nridiculed.\nDalinar wisely remained silent, contemplating the offered tidbit.\n“A strong offensive in Emul,” Jasnah said thoughtfully. “There might be\na gemheart at the center of this monster, Dalinar. A stable Makabak would\nstrengthen our coalition. A clear, powerful victory would raise morale and\nenergize our allies.”\n“A valid point,” Dalinar said, with a grunt.\n“There is more,” Jasnah said. “A reason to want Azir and the\nsurrounding countries secured in the months moving forward.”\n“What more?” Dalinar asked. “What are you talking about?”\nJasnah looked to Wit, who nodded, rising. “I’ll fetch them.

You’ll make me feel obsolete.” He\nslipped out the door.\n“He will bring the Heralds,” Jasnah said. “Until he returns, perhaps we\ncan discuss the proposal I showed you before you left for Hearthstone,\nUncle.”\nOh dear, Navani thought. Here we go.… Jasnah had been pushing toward\na singular law for Alethkar. A dangerous one.\nDalinar stood up and began to pace. Not a good sign. “This isn’t the\ntime, Jasnah. We can’t create social upheaval on this scale during such a\nterrible moment in our history.”\n“Says the man,” Jasnah said, “who wrote a book earlier this year.\nUpending centuries of established gender norms.”\nDalinar winced.\n“Mother,” Jasnah said to Navani, “I thought you said you’d talk to him.”\n“There wasn’t a convenient opportunity,” Navani said. “And … to be\nhonest, I share his concerns.”\n“I forbid this,” Dalinar said. “You can’t simply free every Alethi slave. It\nwould cause mass chaos.”\n“I wasn’t aware,” Jasnah said, “that you could forbid the queen from\ntaking action.”\n“You called it a proposal,” Dalinar said.\n“Because I am not finished with the wording yet,” Jasnah replied. “I\nintend to propose it to the highprinces soon and gauge their reactions. I will\ndeal with their concerns as best I can before I make it law. Whether or not I\nwill make it law, however, is not a matter I intend to debate.”\nDalinar continued to pace. “I cannot see reason in this, Jasnah. The chaos\nthis will cause…”\n“Our lives are already in chaos,” Jasnah said. “This is precisely the time\nto make sweeping changes, when people are already adjusting to a new way\nof life. The historical data supports this idea.”\n“But why?” Dalinar asked. “You’re always so pragmatic. This seems the\nopposite.”\n“I seek the line of action that does the most possible good for the most\npeople. This is in keeping with my moral philosophy.”\nDalinar stopped pacing and rubbed his forehead instead. He looked to\nNavani as if to say, Can you do anything?\n“What did you think would happen?” Navani asked. “Putting her on the\nthrone?”\n“I thought she’d keep the lighteyes in check,” he said. “And figured she\nwouldn’t be bullied by their schemes.”\n“That is exactly what I’m doing,” Jasnah said. “Though I apologize for\nneeding to count you in the group, Uncle. It is good for you to oppose me.\nFeel free to do so visibly. Too many saw Elhokar bending knee to you, and\nthat nasty business with a ‘highking’ still lingers as a distasteful scent. By\nshowing we are not united in this, we strengthen my position, proving I am\nno pawn of the Blackthorn.”\n“I wish you’d slow down,” Dalinar said. “I’m not completely opposed to\nthe theory of what you’re doing. It shows compassion. But…”"

But…”\n“If we slow down,” Jasnah said, “the past catches up to us. History is\nlike that, always gobbling up the present.” She smiled fondly at Dalinar. “I\nrespect and admire your strength, Uncle. I always have. Once in a while\nthough, I do think you need to be reminded that not everyone sees the world\nthe way you do.”\n“It would be better for us all if they did,” he grumbled. “I wish the world\nwould stop making a mess of itself every time I turn the other direction.”\nHe got something to drink from the pitcher of wine. Orange, naturally.\n“Would this include the ardents, daughter?” Navani asked.\n“They’re slaves, aren’t they?”\n“Technically, yes. But in this, some might say you’re pursuing a vendetta\nagainst the church,” Navani said.\n“By freeing the ardents from being owned?” Jasnah asked, amused.\n“Well, I suppose some will say that. They’ll see an attack in anything I do.\nContrastingly, this is for their good. In freeing the ardents, I risk letting the\nchurch become a political power in the world again.”\n“And … that doesn’t worry you?” Navani asked. Sometimes sorting out\nthis woman’s motivations—which she claimed were always very\nstraightforward—was like trying to read the Dawnchant.\n“Of course it worries me,” Jasnah said. “However, I’d prefer ardents\nactively participating in politics, as opposed to the behind-the-scenes smoke\nscreen they use now. This will give them more opportunity for power, yes,\nbut also expose their actions to increased public scrutiny.”\nJasnah tapped the table with a nail on her freehand. She wore her\nsafehand in a sleeve, eminently proper, though Navani knew Jasnah thought\nlittle of social constructs. She followed them anyway. Immaculate makeup.\nHair in braids. A beautiful, regal havah.\n“This will be for the good of Alethkar in the long run,” Jasnah said.\n“Economically and morally. Uncle Dalinar’s objections are valuable. I will\nlisten, figure out how to respond to such challenges.…”\nShe trailed off as Wit returned, bringing two individuals with him. One\nwas a beautiful young woman with long black hair, Makabaki in ethnicity,\nthough her eyes and some of her features looked Shin. The other was a tall\nstoic man, also Makabaki. He was strong, powerful of build, and had a\ncertain regality about him—at least until you saw the distant expression in\nhis eyes and heard him whispering to himself. He needed to be led into the\nroom by the woman, as if he were simple of mind.\nOne could not have known from a glance that these two were ancient\nbeings older than recorded history. Shalash and Talenelat, Heralds,\nimmortals born to dozens of lives, worshipped as gods by many religions—\nand as demigods in Navani’s own. Sadly, they were both insane. The\nwoman could at least function. The man … Navani had never heard\nanything from him other than mumbles."

The man … Navani had never heard\nanything from him other than mumbles.\nWit treated them with a reverence Navani did not expect from him. He\nclosed the door behind them, then gestured quietly for them to sit at the\ntable. Shalash—Ash, as she preferred to be called—led Talenelat to the seat,\nbut remained standing after he sat.\nNavani felt distinctly uncomfortable in their presence. For her entire life,\nshe’d burned glyphwards speaking of these two, praying to the Almighty\nfor their help. She used them in her vows, thought of them in her daily\nworship. Jasnah had abandoned her faith, and Dalinar … she wasn’t certain\nwhat he believed anymore. It was complicated.\nBut Navani held to her hope for the Heralds and the Almighty. Hope that\nthey had plans mere mortals could not understand. Seeing these two in such\na state … it rocked her to the very core. Surely this was part of what the\nAlmighty wanted to happen. Surely there was a reason for everything.\nRight?\n“Two gods,” Wit said, “delivered as requested.”\n“Ash,” Jasnah said. “During our last interview, you were telling me what\nyou knew of my uncle’s abilities. The powers of a Bondsmith.”\n“I told you,” the woman snapped, “that I don’t know anything.”\nConsidering how gently she treated Taln, one might not have expected such\nterse language from her. Navani, unfortunately, had come to accept it as\nnormal.\n“What you told me was useful,” Jasnah said. “Kindly repeat it.”\nDalinar walked over, curious. Jasnah held weekly meetings with the\nHeralds, trying to pry every bit of historical knowledge from their minds.\nShe’d claimed the meetings were mostly fruitless, but Navani knew to hang\non to the word “mostly” when coming from Jasnah. She could hide a great\ndeal in the spaces between those letters.\nAsh sighed loudly, pacing. Not in thought as Dalinar had, but in a way\nreminiscent of a caged animal. “I didn’t know anything of what the\nBondsmiths did. That was always Ishar’s purview. My father would\noccasionally discuss matters of deep Realmatic Theory with him—but I\ndidn’t care for it. Why should I? Ishar had it in hand.”\n“He forged the Oathpact,” Jasnah said. “The … binding that made you\nimmortal and trapped the Voidbringers in another realm of reality.”\n“Braize isn’t another realm of reality,” Ash said. “It’s a planet. You can\nsee it in the sky, along with Ashyn—the Tranquiline Halls, you call it. But\nyeah, the Oathpact. He did that. We all simply went along with it.” She\nshrugged.\nJasnah nodded, showing no sign of annoyance. “But the Oathpact no\nlonger functions?”\n“It’s broken,” Ash said. “Done, shattered, upended. They killed my\nfather a year ago. Permanently, somehow. We all felt it.” She looked\ndirectly at Navani, as if having seen the reverence in her eyes. The next"

The next\nwords came with a sneer. “We can do nothing for you now. There is no\nmore Oathpact.”\n“And do you think Dalinar,” Jasnah asked, “as a Bondsmith, could repair\nor replicate it somehow? Sealing the enemy away?”\n“Who knows?” Ash said. “It doesn’t work the same for you all as it did\nfor us, when we had our swords. You’re limited, but sometimes you do\nthings we couldn’t. At any rate, I never knew much about it.”\n“But there are some who know, aren’t there?” Jasnah said. “A group of\npeople who have practice with Surgebinding? Who experimented with it,\nwho know about Dalinar’s powers?”\n“Yeah,” Ash said.\n“The Shin,” Navani said, understanding Jasnah’s point. “They hold the\nHonorblades. Szeth says they trained with them, knew their abilities.…”\n“Scouts sent to Shinovar vanish,” Dalinar said. “Windrunner flybys\nprompt storms of arrows. They don’t want anything to do with us.”\n“For now,” Jasnah said, looking at Ash. “Right?”\n“They are … unpredictable,” the Herald said. “I eventually left them\nbehind. They tried to kill me, but that I could take. It was when they started\nto worship me…” Ash crossed her arms, pulling them tight. “They had\nlegends … prophecies about the coming of this Return. I didn’t believe it\nwould ever happen. Didn’t want to believe.”\n“We need a stable region in Makabak, Uncle,” Jasnah said. “Because\neventually, we’re going to have to deal with the Shin. And at the very least,\nwe will want to find out what they know about Bondsmiths from centuries\nof holding an Honorblade and experimenting with powers like yours.”\nDalinar turned to Navani. She nodded. There was something here. If they\ncould find a way to seal the Fused away again … well, that could mean the\nend of the war.\n“You make an interesting point,” Dalinar said.\n“Excellent,” Jasnah said. “If we do bring a large offensive into Emul,\nthen I will attend personally and join the war effort there.”\n“… You will?” Dalinar said. “And how … involved do you intend to be\nin the prosecution of the war?”\n“As involved as seems appropriate.”\nHe sighed, and Navani knew what he was thinking. If Jasnah tried to join\nin wartime planning and strategy too forcefully, the highprinces wouldn’t\nlike it. But Dalinar couldn’t complain, not after what he’d done.\n“We’ll deal with that if it becomes a problem, I suppose.” The\nBlackthorn turned toward the Herald. “Ash, tell me more of what you know\nabout the Shin—specifically the ones among them who might know more\nabout my powers.”\nThe Fused have a second metal I find fascinating—a metal that\nconducts Stormlight. The implications for this in the creation of\nfabrials are astounding. The Fused use this metal in conjunction with a\nrudimentary fabrial—a simple gemstone, but without a spren trapped\ninside."

Here, a scribe nodded to him. She had confirmed with\nthe Oathgate on the Shattered Plains that it was safe to initiate a transfer.\nHe did so, using the Sylblade in the lock on the wall of the small\nbuilding.

No, he’d be as awkward as a horse in a uniform standing in a\nballroom and trying not to step on women’s dresses.\nThe idea was silly. But what would he do?\nHe reached a good height, then soared in an invigorating loop, Lashing\nwithout conscious thought. His powers were becoming as intuitive as\nwiggling his fingers. Syl zipped alongside him, laughing as she met a\ncouple of windspren.\nI’ll miss this, he thought, then immediately felt foolish. He wasn’t dying.\nHe was retiring. He would still fly.

You can get turned around\neasily, start to feel like you’re living in a pit.”\nLirin and Hesina followed, entranced by the multicolored strata in the\nwalls, the high ceilings, the general majesty of an enormous tower carved\ncompletely from stone.\n“We originally organized the tower by princedom,” Kaladin continued.\n“Each of the Alethi highprinces was assigned a section of a given floor.\nNavani didn’t like how that turned out; we weren’t using as much of the rim\nof the tower—with its natural light—as she wanted. It often meant\ncrowding large numbers of people into vast rooms that clearly hadn’t been\ndesigned as living spaces, since the highprinces wanted to keep their people\nclose.”\nHe ducked under a strange outcropping of stone in the hallway. Urithiru\nhad numerous such oddities; this one was round, a stone tube crossing the\ncenter of the hallway. Perhaps it was ventilation? Why had it been put right\nwhere people walked?\nMany other features of the tower defied logic. Hallways dead-ended.\nRooms were discovered with no way in save tiny holes to peek through.\nSmall shafts were discovered plummeting down thirty or more stories. One\nmight have called the arrangement mad, but even at its most baffling, hints\nof design—such as crystal veins running along the corners of rooms, or\nplaces where strata wove to form patterns reminiscent of glyphs set into the\nwall—made Kaladin think this place was purposeful and not haphazard.\nThese oddities had been built for reasons they couldn’t yet fathom.\nHis parents ducked under the obstruction. They’d left Kaladin’s brother\nwith Laral’s children and their governess. She seemed to be recovering\nfrom the loss of her husband, though Kaladin thought he knew her well\nenough to see through the front. She truly seemed to have cared for the old\nblowhard, as had her children, a solemn pair of twins far too withdrawn for\ntheir young age.\nUnder Jasnah’s new inheritance laws, Laral would gain the title of\ncitylady, so she’d gone to be formally greeted by Jasnah. While the rest of\nthe people received an orientation to the tower via Navani’s scribes,\nKaladin wanted to show his parents where the people of Hearthstone would\nbe housed.\n“You’re quiet,” Kaladin said to them. “I suppose this place can be"

Isn’t she\nqueen of this tower?”\nKaladin shrugged. “I’ve grown more informal with them as I’ve gotten\nto know them.”\n“He’s lying,” Syl said in a conspiratorial tone from where she sat on\nHesina’s shoulder. “He’s always talked like that. Kaladin called King\nElhokar by his name for ages before becoming a Radiant.”\n“Disrespectful of lighteyed authority,” Hesina said, “and generally\ninclined to do whatever he wants, regardless of social class or traditions.\nWhere in Roshar did he get it?” She glanced at Kaladin’s father, who stood\nby the wall inspecting the lines of strata.\n“I can’t possibly imagine,” Lirin said. “Bring that light closer, son. Look\nhere, Hesina. These strata are green. That can’t be natural.”\n“Dear,” she said, “the fact that the wall is part of a tower roughly the size\nof a mountain didn’t clue you in to the fact that this place isn’t natural?”\n“It must have been Soulcast in this shape,” Lirin said, tapping the stone.\n“Is that jade?”\nKaladin’s mother leaned in to inspect the green vein. “Iron,” she said.\n“Makes the stone turn that shade.”\n“Iron?” Syl said. “Iron is grey though, isn’t it?”\n“Yes,” Lirin said. “It should be copper that makes the rock green,\nshouldn’t it?”\n“You’d think that, wouldn’t you?” Hesina said. “I’m pretty sure that’s\nnot how it works. In any case, maybe we should let Kal show us on to the\nprepared rooms. He’s obviously excited.”\n“How can you tell?” Syl asked. “I don’t think he ever gets excited. Not\neven when I tell him I have a fun surprise for him.”\n“Your surprises,” Kaladin said, “are never fun.”\n“I put a rat in his boot,” Syl whispered. “It took me forever. I can’t lift\nsomething so heavy, so I had to lead it with food.”\n“Why in the Stormfather’s name,” Lirin said, “would you put a rat in his\nboot?”\n“Because it fit so well!” Syl said. “How can you not see how great the\nidea was?”\n“Lirin surgically removed his sense of humor,” Hesina said.\n“Got good money for it on the open market too,” Lirin said.\nHesina leaned in close to Syl. “He replaced it with a clock, which he\nuses to monitor exactly how much time everyone else wastes with their silly\nemotions.”\nSyl looked at her, smiling hesitantly—and Kaladin could tell she wasn’t\nquite certain it was a joke. When Hesina nodded encouragingly, Syl let out\na genuine laugh."

When Hesina nodded encouragingly, Syl let out\na genuine laugh.\n“Now, let’s not get ridiculous,” Lirin said. “I don’t need a clock to\nmonitor how much time everyone wastes. It’s evident that number is nearly\na hundred percent.”\nKaladin leaned against the wall, feeling a familiar peace at their banter.\nOnce, having them close again would have been nearly everything he\nwanted. Watching Lirin obsess. Hearing Hesina trying to get him to pay\nattention to the people around him. The fond way Lirin took the jokes,\nplaying into them by being comically stern.\nIt reminded Kaladin of days spent at the dinner table, or gathering\nmedicinal herbs from the cultivated patches outside of town. He cherished\nthose pastoral memories. Part of him wished he could simply be their little\nboy again—wished they didn’t have to intersect with his current life, where\nthey would undoubtedly start hearing of the things he’d endured and done.\nThe things that eventually had broken him.\nHe turned and continued down the hallway. A steady light ahead told\nhim they were approaching the outer wall. Molten sunlight, open and\ninviting. The cold Stormlight sphere in his hand represented power, but a\nsecretive, angry sort. Inspect gem light, and you could see it shifting,\nstorming, trying to break free. Sunlight represented something more free,\nmore open.\nKaladin entered a new hallway, where the strata lines on the walls turned\ndownward in a fanning pattern—like lapping waves. Sunlight poured in\nthrough doorways on the right.\nKaladin pointed as his parents caught up to him. “Each of these rooms\non the right leads to a large balcony, extending all along the rim here. Laral\nwill get that corner room, which is the largest, with a private balcony. I\nthought we’d reserve the ten here in the center and make them a meeting\narea. The rooms are connected, and some of the other neighborhoods have\nmade their balcony section a large common space.”\nHe continued forward, passing the rooms—which contained stacks of\nblankets, planks for making furniture, and sacks of grain. “We can put\nchairs in there and have a communal kitchen,” he said. “It’s easier than\ntrying to find a way for everyone to cook on their own. Firewood—from the\nrockbud farms on the Plains—needs to be carted in through the Oathgate, so\nit’s on a strict ration. There’s a functioning well on this level not too far\naway though, so you won’t lack for water.\n“I’m not sure yet what everyone’s duties will be. As you probably\nnoticed flying in, Dalinar has started large-scale farming operations out on\nthe Shattered Plains. That might require relocation, but we also might be\nable to get things growing up here. That’s part of how I persuaded Dalinar\nto let me fetch everyone from Hearthstone—we have a lot of soldiers, but\nsurprisingly few people who know their way around a lavis field during\nworming season.”\n“And those rooms?” Hesina asked, pointing down an inward hallway\nlined with openings.\n“Each is big enough for a family,” Kaladin said. “Those don’t have any"

I’m sorry I had to put you all the way up here on the sixth floor.\nThat’s going to mean either waiting for lifts, or taking the stairs. It’s the\nonly way I could find you a spot with balcony rooms. It’s still pretty low I\nguess—I feel bad for whoever has to eventually start living up in those high\nfloors.”\n“It’s wonderful,” Hesina said.\nKaladin waited for Lirin to say something, but he simply walked into\none of the balcony rooms. He passed the supplies and stepped out onto the\nlarge balcony, glancing upward.\nHe doesn’t like it, Kaladin thought. Of course Lirin would find\nsomething to complain about, even after being handed enviable quarters in\nthe mythical city of the Epoch Kingdoms.\nKaladin joined him, following his father’s gaze as Lirin turned and tried\nto look up at the tower, though the balcony above got in the way.\n“What’s at the top?” Lirin asked.\n“Meeting rooms for the Radiants,” Kaladin said. “There’s nothing on the\nvery top—just a flat roof. The view is great though. I’ll show it to you\nsometime.”\n“Enough chatting!” Syl said. “Come on. Follow me!” She zipped off\nHesina’s shoulder and darted through the rooms. When the humans didn’t\nimmediately follow, she flew over, whirled around Hesina’s head, then shot\nback out. “Come on.”\nThey followed, Kaladin trailing his parents as Syl led them through the\nseveral balcony rooms he imagined becoming a large meeting area, with a\nwonderful view out over the mountains. A little chilly, but a large fabrial\nhearth acting as the communal oven would help greatly.\nAt the other end of the connected balcony chambers was a large suite of\nsix rooms, with their own washrooms and a private balcony. It was the\nmirror of Laral’s at the other end. These two seemed to have been built for\nofficers and their families, so Kaladin had reserved it for a special purpose.\nSyl led them through a front room, down a hallway past two closed\ndoors, and into a main sitting room. “We spent all week getting it ready!”\nshe said, darting around this chamber. The far wall had a set of stone\nshelves full of books. He’d spent a large chunk of his monthly stipend to\nacquire them. As a youth, he’d often felt bad for how few books his mother\nhad.\n“I didn’t know there were so many books in the world,” Syl said. “Won’t\nthey use up all the words? Seems like eventually you’d say everything that\ncould be said!” She zipped over to a smaller side room. “There’s a space for\nthe baby here, and I picked out the toys, because Kaladin would probably\nhave bought him a spear or something dumb.

At Syl’s prompting, Lirin opened one of\nthe doors in the hallway, revealing a fully stocked surgery room. Exam\ntable. A glistening set of the finest instruments, including equipment\nKaladin’s father had never been able to afford: scalpels, a device for\nlistening to a patient’s heartbeat, a magnificent fabrial clock, a fabrial\nheating plate for boiling bandages or cleansing surgical tools.\nKaladin’s father stepped into the room, while Hesina stood in the\ndoorway, hand to her mouth in amazement, a shockspren—like shattering\npieces of yellow light—adorning her. Lirin picked up several of the tools,\none at a time, then began inspecting the various jars of ointment, powder,\nand medication Kaladin had stocked on the shelf.\n“I ordered in the best from Taravangian’s physicians,” Kaladin said.\n“You’ll need to have Mother read to you about some of these newer\nmedications—they’re discovering some remarkable things at the hospitals\nin Kharbranth. They say they’ve found a way to infect people with a weak,\neasily overcome version of a disease—which leaves them immune for life\nto more harsh variants.”\nLirin seemed … solemn. More than normal. Despite Hesina’s jokes,\nLirin did laugh—he had emotions. Kaladin had seen them from him\nfrequently. To have him respond to all of this with such quietude …\nHe hates it, Kaladin thought. What did I do wrong?\nOddly, Lirin sat and slumped in one of the nearby seats. “It is very nice,\nson,” he said softly. “But I don’t see the use of it anymore.”\n“What?” Kaladin asked. “Why?”\n“Because of what those Radiants can do,” Lirin said. “I saw them\nhealing with a touch! A simple gesture from an Edgedancer can seal cuts,\neven regrow limbs. This is wonderful, son, but … but I don’t see a use for\nsurgeons any longer.”\nHesina leaned in to Kaladin. “He’s been moping about this the whole\ntrip,” she whispered.\n“I’m not moping,” Lirin said. “To be sad about such a major revolution\nin healing would be not only callous, but selfish as well. It’s just…” Lirin\ntook a deep breath. “I guess I’ll need to find something else to do.”\nStorms. Kaladin knew that exact emotion. That loss. That worry. That\nsudden feeling of becoming a burden.\n“Father,” Kaladin said, “we have fewer than fifty Edgedancers—and just\nthree Truthwatchers. Those are the only orders that can heal.”\nLirin looked up, cocking his head.\n“We brought over a dozen with us to save Hearthstone,” Kaladin said,\n“because Dalinar wanted to be certain our new flying platform didn’t fall to\nthe enemy. Most of the time those Edgedancers are serving on the\nbattlefront, healing soldiers. The few on duty in Urithiru can be used for\nonly the most dire of wounds.\n“Plus their powers have limitations.

You’re not obsolete.\nTrust me, you’re going to be very, very useful here.”\nLirin regarded the room again, seeing it with new eyes. He grinned, then\n—possibly thinking he shouldn’t take joy in the idea that people would still\nneed surgeons—stood up. “Well then! I suppose I should familiarize myself\nwith this new equipment. Medications that can prevent diseases, you say?\nWhat an intriguing concept.”\nKaladin’s mother gave him an embrace, then went into the other room to\nlook over the books. Kaladin finally let himself relax, settling into a chair in\nthe surgery room.\nSyl landed on his shoulder and took the form of a young woman in a full\nhavah, with her hair pinned up in the Alethi fashion. She folded her arms\nand glared up at him expectantly.\n“What?” he asked.\n“You going to tell them?” she said. “Or do I have to?”\n“Now’s not the time.”\n“Why not?”\nHe failed to come up with a good reason. She kept bullying him with her\nfrustratingly insistent spren stare—she didn’t blink unless she pointedly\ndecided to, so he’d never met anyone else who could glare quite like Syl.\nOnce she’d even enlarged her eyes to disturbing proportions to deliver a\nparticularly important point.\nEventually Kaladin stood, causing her to streak off as a ribbon of light.\n“Father,” he said. “You need to know something.”\nLirin turned from his study of the medications, and Hesina peeked her\nhead into the room, curious.\n“I’m going to be leaving the military,” Kaladin said. “I need a break\nfrom the fighting, and Dalinar commanded it. So I thought maybe I would\ntake the room beside Oroden’s. I … might need to find something different\nto do with my life.”\nHesina raised her hand to her lips again. Lirin stopped dead, going pale,\nas if he’d seen a Voidbringer. Then his face burst with the widest grin\nKaladin had ever seen on him. He strode over and seized Kaladin by the\narms.\n“That’s what this is about, isn’t it?” Lirin said. “The surgery room, the\nsupplies, that talk of the clinic. You’ve realized it. You finally understand\nthat I’ve been right. You’re going to become a surgeon like we always\ndreamed!”\n“I…”\nThat was the answer, of course. The one Kaladin had been purposely\navoiding. He’d considered the ardents, he’d considered the generals, and\nhe’d considered running away.\nThe answer was in the face of his father, a face that a part of Kaladin\ndreaded. Deep down, Kaladin had known there was only one place he could\ngo once the spear was taken from him.\n“Yes,” Kaladin said. “You’re right. You’ve always been right, Father.

Four\ngarnets stood out, the same construction used in the suppression fabrial. The\nlayouts were too precise, too exact, to be a coincidence.\nIt had seemed like a breakthrough, and she’d set Rushu and the others\ncomparing all other known fabrials to the pillar, searching for any that\nseemed similar. That once-promising lead, unfortunately, had reached\nanother dead end.\n“There’s another problem,” Rushu said.\n“Only one?” When the young ardent frowned, Navani waved for her to\ncontinue. “What is it?”\n“We inspected the suppression fabrial in Shadesmar, as you asked,”\nRushu said. “Your theory is correct, it manifests a spren in Shadesmar as\nSoulcasters do. But on this side, there is no sign of that spren in the\ngemstones.”\n“What’s the problem, then?” Navani asked. “My theory is correct.”\n“Brightness, the spren that runs the suppression device … has been\ncorrupted, very similar to…”\n“To Renarin’s spren,” Navani said.\n“Indeed. The spren refused to talk to us, but didn’t seem as insensate as\nthe ones in Soulcasters. This reinforces your theory that ancient fabrials—\nthings like the pumps, the Oathgates, and the Soulcasters—somehow\nimprisoned their spren in the Cognitive Realm. When we pressed it, the\nspren closed its eyes pointedly. It seems to be working with the enemy\ndeliberately, which raises questions about your nephew’s spren. Dare we\ntrust it?”\n“We have no reason to assume that one spren serving the enemy means\nall of its type do,” Navani said. “We should assume they each have\nindividual loyalties, like humans.”\nShe had to admit, however, that Renarin’s spren made her\nuncomfortable. Seeing the future? Well, she had already tied her mind in\nknots thinking about Glys. Instead, she tried to focus on the nature of this\nfabrial’s spren.\nYou capture spren, the strange person had said to her via spanreed. You\nimprison them. Hundreds of them. You are a monster.

You must stop.\nWeeks had passed without a quiver from the spanreed. Was it possible\nthis person knew how to create fabrials the old way, which appeared to use\nsapient spren, locking them in the Cognitive Realm? Perhaps this method\nwas preferable and more humane. The magnificent spren that controlled the\nOathgates didn’t seem to begrudge their attachment to the devices, for\nexample, and were fully capable of interacting.\n“For now, study this,” Navani said to Rushu, tapping her knuckles\nagainst the majestic gemstone pillar. “See if you can find a way to activate\nthis specific group of garnets. In the past, the tower was protected from the\nFused. Old writings agree on this fact. This part of the pillar must be why.”\n“Yes…” Rushu said. “A fine theory, and a fine suggestion. If we focus on\nthis one piece of the pillar, which we know is a distinct fabrial, maybe we\ncan activate it.”\n“Also try resetting the suppression fabrial we stole. It smothered\nKaladin’s abilities, but let the Fused use their powers. There might be a way\nto reverse the device’s effects.”\nRushu nodded in her absentminded way. Navani continued to stare up at\nthe pillar, which sparkled with the light of a thousand facets. What was she\nmissing? Why couldn’t she activate it?\nShe handed the schematic to Rushu and began walking from the room.\n“We haven’t been giving enough thought to the tower’s security,” she said.\n“Clearly the ancients were worried about incursions by the Fused—and we\nexperienced one already.”\n“The Oathgates are under constant guard now,” Rushu said, hurrying to\nkeep up. “And authentication by two different orders of Radiants is required\nfor activation. It seems unlikely the enemy could do what they did before.”\n“Yes, but what if they came in another way?” The spren she’d\ninterviewed claimed that the Masked Ones—Fused with Lightweaving\npowers—couldn’t enter the tower. Its ancient protections had some\nlingering effects, like the changes in pressure or the warmth. Indeed, this\nseemed proven, as while Masked Ones sometimes slipped into human\ncamps, they had never come to Urithiru.\nAt least so far as Navani could tell. Perhaps they’d just been very\ncareful. “The enemy,” Navani said to Rushu, “has abilities we can only\nguess at—and the powers we do know about are dangerous enough.\nMasked Ones could be among us and we’d never know it. You or I could be\none of them right now.”\n“That … is a highly disturbing thought, Brightness,” Rushu said. “What\ncould we possibly do? Other than fixing the tower’s defenses.”\n“Gather a team of our best abstract thinkers. Assign them the task of\ncreating protocols to identify hidden Fused.”\n“Understood,” Rushu said. “Dali would be perfect for that.

When first studying the\ntower, they’d found dozens of gemstones in this room, all encoded with\nshort messages from the ancient Knights Radiant.\nOver the months, the room had transformed from a dedicated study of\nthose gemstones into a laboratory where Navani had organized her finest\nengineers. She had been around enough intelligent people to know they\nworked best in an encouraging environment where study and discovery\nwere rewarded.\nInside this room, concentrationspren moved like ripples in the sky, and a\nfew logicspren—like little stormclouds—hovered in the air. Engineers\nworked on dozens of projects: some practical designs, others more fanciful.\nAs soon as she stepped in, an excited young engineer scrambled up.\n“Brightness!” he said. “It’s working!”\n“That’s wonderful,” she said, struggling to remember his name. Young,\nbald, barely a beard to speak of. What project had he been on?\nHe grabbed her by the arm and towed her to the side, ignoring propriety.\nShe didn’t mind. It was a mark of pride to her that so many of the engineers\nforgot she was anything other than the person who funded their projects.\nShe spotted Falilar at the worktable, and that jogged her memory. The\nyoung ardent was his nephew, Tomor, a darkeyed youth who wanted to\nfollow his uncle’s path of scholarship. She’d assigned the two one of her\nmore serious designs, a set of new lifts that worked on the same principle as\nthe flying platform.\n“Brightness,” Falilar said, bowing to her. “The design requires a great\ndeal more tweaking. I fear it’s going to require too much manpower to be\nefficient.”\n“But it’s working?” Navani said.\n“Yes!” Tomor said, bringing her a device shaped like a jewelry box,\naround six inches square, with a handle on one side. The handle—like the\none you might use to pull open a drawer—held a trigger for the index finger\non the inside. A button on the top was the box’s only other feature, except\nfor a set of straps that she took for a wrist brace.\nNavani accepted the box and peeked in through the access panel. There\nwere two separate fabrial constructions inside. One she recognized for a\nsimple conjoining ruby, like those used in spanreeds. The other was more\nexperimental, a practical application of the designs she’d given Tomor and\nFalilar: a device for redirecting force, and for quickly engaging or\ndisengaging alignment with the conjoined fabrial.\nIt wasn’t exactly the same method that kept the Fourth Bridge flying. It\nwas more a cousin to that technology.\n“We decided to make the prototype an individual device,” Falilar said,\n“as you wanted something portable.”\n“Here!” Tomor said. “Let me get the workers ready!” He scrambled over\nto a couple of soldiers at the side of the room, assigned to run errands for\nthe engineers. Tomor got them into position holding a rope, like they were\nabout to engage in a tug-of-war—only instead of a rival team on the other"

Right now, the rubies weren’t conjoined, allowing the\nbox to move freely. Once she pressed the button, however, the device\nsnapped into conjoinment with the second box, the one on the floor attached\nto the rope.\nNext, she pulled the trigger with her index finger. This made the ruby\nflash brightly for the soldiers, who began pulling their rope. They moved\ntheir box along the floor, and the force was transferred across the space to\nNavani. And she was yanked—by the box and handle strapped to her wrist\n—steadily across the room.\nIt was a common application of conjoined fabrials. The big difference\nhere was not in the fact that force was being transferred, but the direction of\nthe transfer. The men were pulling the box backward along the wall,\nmoving steadily eastward. Navani was being pulled forward along the axis\nwhere she’d pointed her arm—a random direction south by southwest.\nShe flashed the light to warn the soldiers, then disjoined the fabrials, so\nshe stopped skidding. The men were ready for this, and prepared as she\npointed her hand in a different direction. When she conjoined again and\nflashed the ruby for the men, they began pulling—and she moved that way\ninstead.\n“It’s working wonderfully,” Navani said, skidding on her heels. “The\nability to redirect the force in any direction—on the fly—is going to have\nhuge practical applications.”\n“Yes, Brightness,” Falilar said, walking beside her, “I agree—but the\nmanpower issue is a serious one. It already requires the work of hundreds to\nkeep the Fourth Bridge in the air and moving. How many more can we\nspare?”\nFortunately, that was the exact problem Navani had been trying to solve.\nThis is working, she thought with excitement, turning off the fabrial, then\nhaving the men pull her in a third direction. Making the Fourth Bridge rise\ninto the air had not been terribly difficult—the truly hard part had been\ngetting it to move laterally after raising it into the air.\nThe secret to making the Fourth Bridge fly—and to making this\nhandheld device work—involved a rare metal called aluminum. It was what\nthe Fused used for weapons that could block Shardblades, but the metal\ndidn’t just interfere with Shardblades—it interfered with all kinds of\nStormlight mechanics. Interactions with it during the expedition into Aimia\nearlier in the year had led Navani to order experiments, and Falilar himself\nhad made the breakthrough.\nThe trick was to use a specific fabrial cage, made from aluminum,\naround the conjoined rubies. The details were complicated, but with the\nproper caging, an artifabrian could make a conjoined ruby ignore motion\nmade by the other along specific vectors or planes. So, in application, the\nFourth Bridge could use two different dummy ships to move. One to go up\nand down, the other to go laterally."

One to go up\nand down, the other to go laterally.\nThe complexities of that excited Navani and her engineers, and had led\nto the new device she now wore. She could move her arm in any direction\nshe wanted, conjoin the fabrial, then direct force through it in a specific\ndirection.\nMomentum and energy were conserved per natural conjoined fabrial\nmechanics. Her scientists had tested this a hundred different ways, and\nsome applications quickly drained the fabrial—but they’d known about\nthose from ancient experiments. Still, there were thoughts whirring in her\nhead. There were ways they could use this to directly translate Stormlight\nenergy into mechanical energy.\nAnd she’d been thinking of other ways to replace the manpower\nneeds.…\n“Brightness?” Falilar said. “You seem concerned. I’m sorry if the device\nhas more problems than you expected. It’s an early iteration.”\n“Falilar, you worry too much,” Navani said. “The device is amazing.”\n“But … the manpower problem…”\nNavani smiled. “Come with me.”\n* * *\nA short time later, Navani led Falilar into a section of the twentieth floor of\nthe tower. Here she had another team working—though this one was made\nup of more laborers and fewer engineers. They’d located a strange shaft,\none of many odd features of the tower. This one plummeted through the\ntower past its basements, eventually connecting to a cavern deep beneath.\nThough the original purpose of it baffled their surveyors and scientists,\nNavani had a plan for the shaft. It had involved setting up several steel\nweights here, each as heavy as three men, suspended on ropes.\nShe nodded to the workers as they bowed, several holding up sphere\nlanterns for her and the ardents as they stepped up to the deep hole, which\nwas a good six feet across. Navani peered over the side, and Falilar joined\nher, gripping the railing with nervous fingers.\n“How far down does it go?” he asked.\n“Far past the basement,” Navani said, holding up the box he had\nconstructed. “Let’s say that, instead of men pulling a rope, we bolted the\nother half of this fabrial to one of these weights. Then we could connect the\ndevice’s trigger to these pulleys at the top—so that the trigger dropped the\nweight.”\n“You’d get your arm pulled off!” Falilar said. “You’d be yanked hard in\nwhatever direction you’ve pointed the device.”\n“Resistance on the pulley line could modulate the initial force,” Navani\nsaid. “Maybe we could make it so the strength of the trigger pull determines\nhow fast the line is let out—and how fast you are propelled.”\n“A clever application,” Falilar said, wiping his brow as he glanced at the\ndark shaft. “It doesn’t do anything about the manpower issue though.\nSomeone has to get those weights back up here.”\n“Captain?” Navani asked the soldier leading the crew on this floor.\n“The windmills have been set up as requested,” the man said—he was\nmissing an arm, the right sleeve of his uniform sewn up.

Dalinar was\nalways on the lookout for ways to keep his wounded officers involved in the\nimportant work of the war effort. “I’m told they’re rated for storms, though\nof course no device can be perfectly protected in a highstorm.”\n“What’s this?” Falilar asked.\n“Windmills inside steel casings,” Navani said, “with gemstones on the\nblades—each one conjoined with a ruby on the pulley system up above. The\nstorm blows, and these five weights are ratcheted to the top, potential\nenergy stored for later use.”\n“Ah…” Falilar said. “Brightness, I see.…”\n“Every few days,” Navani said, “the storms gift us an enormous\noutpouring of kinetic strength. Winds that level forests; lightning as bright\nas the sun.” She patted one of the ropes with the weights. “We simply need\nto find a way to store that energy. This could power a fleet of ships. Enough\npulleys, weights, and windmills … and we could fly an air force around the\nworld, all using the harnessed energy of the highstorms.”\n“How…” Falilar said, his eyes alight. “How do we make this happen,\nBrightness? What can I do?”\n“Testing,” she said, “and iterations. We need systems that can withstand\nthe strain of repeated use. We need more flexibility, more streamlining. Your\ndevice here. Can you install a switching mechanism so we can move\nbetween fabrials on these five weights? A lift that could go up five times\nbefore needing to be recharged is far more useful than one that can go up\nonly once.”\n“Yes…” he said. “And we could use the weight of people traveling back\ndown to help recharge some of the weights.… Do you want us to make true\nlifts, or continue with the personal lift device, as Tomor designed? He’s\nexcited by the idea.…”\n“Do both,” Navani suggested. “Let him continue on the single-person\ndevice, but suggest he shape it like a crossbow you point somewhere, rather\nthan a box with a handle. Make it look interesting, and people will be more\ninterested. One of the tricks of fabrial science.”\n“Yes … I see, Brightness.”\nShe checked the clock she wore in the fabrial housing on her left arm.\nStorms. It was almost time for the meeting of monarchs. It wouldn’t do for\nher to be late after the number of times she’d chided Dalinar for ignoring\nhis clock.\n“See where your imagination takes you,” she repeated to Falilar. “You’ve\nspent years building bridges to span chasms. Let’s learn how to span the\nsky.”\n“It will be done,” he said, taking the box. “This is genius, Brightness.\nTruly.”\nShe smiled. They liked to say that, and she appreciated the sentiment.\nThe truth was, she merely knew how to harness the genius of others—as\nshe was hoping to harness the storm.\n* * *\nShe arrived at the meeting with time to spare, fortunately.

        "text": "* * *\nShe arrived at the meeting with time to spare, fortunately. It was held in a\nchamber near the top of the tower, where Dalinar had made each monarch\ncarry their own seat months ago.\nShe remembered the tension of those initial meetings, each member\nspeaking carefully—anxiously, as if a whitespine slumbered nearby. These\ndays, the room was loud and full of chatter. She knew most of the ministers\nand functionaries by name, and asked after their families. She caught sight\nof Dalinar chatting amiably with Queen Fen and Kmakl.\nIt was remarkable. In another time, a united coalition of Alethi, Veden,\nThaylen, and Azish forces would have been the most incredible thing to\nhave happened in generations. Unfortunately, it was only possible in\nresponse to greater marvels—and threats.\nStill, she couldn’t help feeling optimistic as she chatted. Right up until\nshe turned around and came face-to-face with Taravangian.\nThe kindly-looking old man had regrown his wispy beard and mustache\n—of a style that was reminiscent of old scholars from ancient paintings.\nOne might easily imagine this robed figure as some guru sitting in a shrine,\npontificating about the nature of storms and the souls of men.\n“Ah, Brightness,” he said. “I have yet to congratulate you on the success\nof your flying ship. I am eager to see the schematics once you feel\ncomfortable sharing them.”\nNavani nodded. Gone was the feigned innocence, the pretended\nstupidity, that Taravangian had maintained for so long. A lesser man might\nhave persisted stubbornly in his lies. To his credit, once the Assassin in\nWhite had joined Dalinar, Taravangian had dropped the act and\nimmediately slipped into a new role: that of a political genius.\n“How go the troubles at home, Taravangian?” Navani asked.\n“We have reached agreements,” Taravangian said. “As I suspect you\nalready know, Brightness. I have chosen my new heir from Veden stock,\nratified by the highprinces, and made provisions for Kharbranth to go to my\ndaughter. For now, the Vedens see the truth: We cannot squabble over\ndetails during an invasion.”\n“That is well,” she said, trying—and failing—to keep the coldness from\nher voice. “A pity we don’t have access to the military minds of the Veden\nelite, not to mention their best young soldiers. All sent to their graves in a\npointless civil war mere months before the coming of the Everstorm.”\n“Do you think, Brightness,” Taravangian said, “that the Veden king\nwould have accepted Dalinar’s proposals of unification? Do you really\nthink that old Hanavanar—the paranoid man who spent years playing his\nown highprinces against one another—would ever have joined this\ncoalition? His death might well have been the best thing that ever happened\nto Alethkar. Think on that, Brightness, before your accusations set the room\naflame.”\nHe was correct, unfortunately. It was unlikely the late king of Jah Keved\nwould ever have listened to Dalinar—the Vedens had deep-seated grudges\nwith the Blackthorn. The coalition’s early days had depended greatly upon\nthe fact that Taravangian had joined it, bringing the might of a broken—but"

The coalition’s early days had depended greatly upon\nthe fact that Taravangian had joined it, bringing the might of a broken—but\nstill formidable—Jah Keved.\n“It might be easier to accept your goodwill, Your Majesty,” Navani said,\n“if you hadn’t tried to undermine my husband by revealing sensitive\ninformation to the coalition.”\nTaravangian stepped close, and a part of Navani panicked. This man\nterrified her, she realized. Her instincts toward him were the same she might\nhave toward an enemy soldier with a sword. Yet at the end of the day, a\nsingle man with a sword was no threat to kingdoms. This man had fooled\nthe smartest people in the world. He had conned his way into Dalinar’s\ninner circle. He had played them for fools, all while seizing the throne of\nJah Keved. And everyone had praised him.\nThat was true danger.\nShe forced herself not to shy away as he leaned in close; he didn’t seem\nto intend the maneuver to be threatening. He was shorter than she was, and\nhad no physical presence with which to impose. Instead he spoke softly.\n“Everything I’ve done was in the name of protecting humankind. Every step\nI’ve taken, every ploy I’ve devised, every pain I’ve suffered. It was all done\nto protect our future.\n“I could point out that your own husbands—both of them—committed\ncrimes that far outweigh mine. I ordered the murder of a handful of tyrants,\nbut I burned no cities. Yes, the lighteyes of Jah Keved turned on one another\nonce their king was dead, but I did not force them. Those deaths are not my\nburden.\n“All of this is immaterial, however. Because I would have burned\nvillages to prevent what was coming. I would have sent the Vedens into\nchaos. No matter the cost, I would have paid it. Know this. If humankind\nsurvives the new storm, it will be because of the actions I took. I stand by\nthem.”\nHe stepped back, leaving her trembling. Something about his intensity,\nthe confidence of his words, left her speechless.\n“I truly am impressed by your discoveries,” he said. “We all benefit from\nwhat you’ve accomplished. Perhaps in future years few will think to thank\nyou, but I do so now.” He bowed to her, then walked over to take his seat, a\nlonely man who no longer brought attendants with him to these meetings.\nDangerous, a part of her thought again. And incredible. Yes, most men\nwould have denied the accusations. Taravangian had leaned into them,\ntaken ownership of them.\nIf mankind was truly fighting for its very survival, could any of them\nturn away the aid of the man who had expertly seized the throne of a\nkingdom far more powerful than his lowly city-state? She doubted Dalinar\nwould have thought twice about Taravangian—even with the assassinations\nexposed—if not for one difficult question.\nWas Taravangian working for the enemy? They risked the future of the\nworld itself on the answer.\nNavani found her seat as Noura—the head Azish vizier—called the\nmeeting to order.

        "text": "Navani found her seat as Noura—the head Azish vizier—called the\nmeeting to order. She generally led the meetings these days; everyone\nresponded well to her calm air of wisdom. The primary order of business\nwas to discuss Dalinar’s proposal for making a large offensive into Emul,\ncrushing the enemy troops there up against the god-priest of Tukar. Noura\nhad him stand up to outline the proposal, though Jasnah’s scribes had sent\ndetailed explanations to everyone in advance.\nNavani let her mind wander, her thoughts circling around the phantom\nspanreed author. You must stop making this new kind of fabrial.… Perhaps\nthey meant the ones using aluminum?\nSoon enough Dalinar finished his proposal, opening the floor to\ndiscussion by the other monarchs. As expected, the young Azish Prime\nAqasix was the first to respond. Yanagawn was looking more and more like\nan emperor each day, as the rest of his body was growing into the lanky\nheight puberty had given him. He stood up, speaking for himself in the\nmeeting—something he preferred to do, despite Azish custom.\n“We were delighted to receive this proposal, Dalinar,” the Prime said in\nexcellent Alethi. He’d likely prepared this speech ahead of time, so he\nwouldn’t make mistakes. “And we thank Her Majesty Jasnah Kholin for her\nthorough written explanations of its merits. As you can likely guess, we\nneeded no persuasion to accept this plan.”\nHe gestured toward the Emuli prime, a man living—as most of the\nAlethi did—in exile. The coalition had promised him a restored Emul in the\npast, but had so far been unable to deliver.\n“The union of Makabaki states has discussed already, and we support\nthis proposal wholeheartedly,” Yanagawn said. “It is bold and decisive. We\nwill lend it our every resource.”\nNo surprise there, Navani thought. But Taravangian will oppose it. The\nold schemer had always pushed them to invest more heavily into the fight\non his borders. The Mink had been clear in his final report; he feared\nTaravangian’s actions were a ploy to get Dalinar to overextend into\nAlethkar. Additionally, Taravangian had historically taken the role of the\nmore cautious, conservative one in the council, and as such, had good\nreason to oppose committing to Emul.\nThe wildcard would be Queen Fen and the Thaylens. She wore a bright\npatterned skirt today, decidedly not of Vorin fashion, and the white ringlets\nof her eyebrows bounced as she looked from Jasnah to Dalinar, thoughtful.\nMost of the room seemed to be able to read how this would play out.\nTaravangian disagreeing, Azir supporting. So how would Fen—\n“If I may speak,” Taravangian said, standing. “I would like to applaud\nthis bold and wonderful proposal. Jah Keved and Kharbranth support it\nwholeheartedly. I have asked my generals how we might best lend our aid,\nand we can deliver twenty thousand troops to march immediately through\nthe Oathgates for deployment into Emul.”\nWhat? Navani thought. He supported the proposal?\nStorms. What had they missed? Why would he be so willing to pull\ntroops away from his border now, after a year of insisting he couldn’t spare"

Why would he be so willing to pull\ntroops away from his border now, after a year of insisting he couldn’t spare\neven a handful? He’d always used the ubiquity of his medical support to\ncloud his miserly troop deployments.\nHad he realized Dalinar wasn’t going to give an opportunity for\nbetrayal? Was this something else?\n“We are grateful for your support, Taravangian,” Yanagawn said.\n“Dalinar, that is two for your proposal. Three with you, and four, assuming\nyour niece is already persuaded. The only one we await is Her Majesty.” He\nturned to Fen.\n“Her Majesty,” Fen said, “is storming baffled. When’s the last time the\nlot of us all agreed on something?”\n“We all vote favor for lunching break,” Yanagawn said, smiling and\ndeviating from his script. “Usually.”\n“Well, that’s the truth.” Fen leaned back in her seat. “You surprised me\nwith this one, Dalinar. I knew you were tacking toward some goal, but I\nthought for sure you would insist on trying to recapture your homeland.\nThis general you recovered, he changed your mind, didn’t he?”\nDalinar nodded. “He would like me to move that Herdaz be granted a\nseat on our council.”\n“Herdaz is no more,” Fen said. “But I suppose the same could be said for\nAlethkar. I suggest that if his help proves useful in Emul, we grant such a\nrequest. For now, how do we proceed? I suspect an attack into Emul will\nprovoke the enemy navy to finally come out and engage us, so I’ll need to\nplan for a blockade. Tukar has a long coast; that’s going to be a challenge.\nStormblessed, I suppose we can count on Windrunner patrols to help warn\nus of…”\nFen trailed off, twisting around toward the small group of Radiants at the\nside of the room. Each Radiant order usually sent at least one\nrepresentative. Taravangian’s Dustbringer was there as usual, and Lift was\nlikely somewhere, judging from the state of the snack table—though a few\nother Edgedancers were sitting at the rear as well.\nNormally Kaladin would be there, leaning against the wall, looming like\na stormcloud. No longer. Instead Sigzil stepped forward, newly minted as\ncompanylord. It was an interesting move, elevating a foreigner—but it was\na freedom Dalinar gained by no longer being directly tied to Alethkar. In\nthis tower, ethnicity was secondary to Radiant bonds.\nSigzil didn’t have the presence of his highmarshal; he always seemed\ntoo … fiddly to Navani. He cleared his throat, sounding uncomfortable in\nhis new role. “You will have Windrunner support, Your Majesty. The enemy\nair troops might not want to fly in from Iri or Alethkar, as both routes would\nrequire them to traverse our lands. The Heavenly Ones might try to loop\naround and come in from the ocean. Plus, they’ve been employing\nSkybreakers frequently in the region—so we’ll need to contend with them.”\n“Good,” Fen said. “Where’s Stormblessed?”\n“Leave of absence, Your Majesty. He was wounded recently.”"

He was wounded recently.”\n“What kind of wound can bring down a Windrunner?” Fen snapped.\n“Don’t you regrow body parts?”\n“Um, yes, Your Majesty. The highmarshal is recovering from a different\nkind of wound.”\nShe grunted, looking over at Dalinar. “Well, the guilds of Thaylenah\nagree to this plan. If we retake Emul and Tukar, it will give us absolute\ndominance of the Southern Depths. You couldn’t ask for a better staging\nplatform for eventually recovering Alethkar. You’re wise, Blackthorn, to\ndelay striking for your homeland in favor of the tactically sound move.”\n“It was a difficult decision, Fen,” Navani said. “One we made only after\nexploring every other option.” And Taravangian agreeing to it has me\nworried.\n“It highlights another problem though,” Fen said. “We need more\nWindrunners. Kmakl has been raving about your flying fortress—I’ll have\nyou know, I haven’t seen him this smitten since our first days courting. But\nthe enemy has both Fused and Skybreakers, and you can’t protect a ship\nlike that without air support. Stormfather help us if enemies in the air catch\none of our ocean fleets unprotected.”\n“We’ve been working on a solution,” Dalinar promised. “It is a …\ndifficult problem. Spren can be even more stubborn than men.”\n“Makes sense,” Fen said. “I’ve never met a wind or current that would\nchange course because I shouted at them.”\nSomeone cleared their throat, and Navani was surprised to see Sigzil\nstepping forward again. “I’ve been speaking with my spren, Your Majesty,\nand I might be able to offer a potential solution to this problem. I believe we\nshould send an envoy to the honorspren.”\nNavani leaned forward in her seat. “What kind of envoy?”\n“The honorspren can be a … touchy group,” Sigzil explained. “Many are\nnot as carefree as our initial interactions with them led us to believe. Among\nspren, they are some of the closest in spirit and intent to the god Honor.\nWhile obviously individuals will vary in personality, there is a general\nfeeling of discontent—well, insult—among them regarding humans.”\nSigzil surveyed the crowd, and could plainly see that many of them\nweren’t following him. He took a deep breath. “Here, let me say it this way.\nPretend there was a kingdom you wanted to be our ally in this war. Except\nwe betrayed them a few generations ago in a similar alliance. Would we be\nsurprised that they refused to help us now?”\nNavani found herself nodding.\n“So, you’re saying we need to repair relations,” Fen said, “for something\nthat happened thousands of years ago?”\n“Your Majesty,” Sigzil said, “with respect, the Recreance is ancient\nhistory to us—but to the spren it was only a few generations ago. The\nhonorspren are upset; they feel their trust was betrayed. In their eyes, we\nnever addressed what we did to them. For lack of a better term, their honor\nwas offended.”"

If Odium claims this land, they’ll suffer as much as\nwe will!”\n“I know that, sir,” Sigzil said. “You don’t have to persuade me. But\nagain, think of a nation your ancestors offended, but whose resources you\nnow need. Wouldn’t you at least send an envoy with an official apology?”\nHe shrugged. “I can’t promise it will work, but my advice is that we try.”\nNavani nodded again. She’d usually ignored this man because he acted\nso much like … well, a scribe. The kind of nitpicky person who often\ncreated more work for others. She now recognized that was unfair. She had\nfound wisdom in the efforts of scholars others thought to be too focused on\ndetails.\nIt’s because he’s a man, she thought. And a soldier, not an ardent. He\ndidn’t act like the other Windrunners, so she’d dismissed him. Not a good\nlook, Navani, she thought at herself. For one who claims to be a patron of\nthe thoughtful.\n“This man speaks wisdom,” she said to the others. “We have been\npresumptuous in regards to the spren.”\n“Can we send you, Radiant?” Fen asked Sigzil. “You seem to understand\ntheir mindset.”\nSigzil grimaced. “That might be a bad idea. We Windrunners … we’re\nacting in defiance of honorspren law. We’d make the worst envoys, because\nof … well, they don’t much like Kaladin, to be honest. If one of us showed\nup at their fortress, they might try to arrest us.\n“My advice is to send a small but important contingent of other\nRadiants. Specifically, Radiants who have bonded spren whose relatives\napprove of what we’re doing. They can make arguments on our behalf.”\n“That rules me out,” Jasnah said. “The other inkspren are generally\nopposed to what Ivory did in bonding with me.” She glanced to Renarin,\nwho sat at the rear of the room, behind his brother. He glanced up in a\npanic, his puzzle box frozen in his hands. “We probably,” Jasnah continued,\n“don’t want to send Renarin either. Considering his … special\ncircumstances.”\n“An Edgedancer, then?” Dalinar said. “The cultivationspren have\ngenerally embraced our new order of Radiants. I believe some of those who\nbonded Radiants are regarded highly in Shadesmar.”\nTrue to Navani’s earlier guess, Lift emerged from underneath the table—\nthough she hit her head climbing out, then glared at the table. The Reshi girl\n—well, teen—barely fit in spaces like that any longer, and seemed able to\nhit her elbows on every piece of furniture she passed.\n“I’ll go,” Lift said, then yawned. “I’m getting bored here.”\n“Perhaps … someone older,” Dalinar said.\n“Nah,” Lift said. “You need them all.

I didn’t believe it at first, ’cuz I never\nheard of him before he started bothering me. It’s true though. Spren are\nweird, so they like weird things, like silly little vine people.”\nThe room fell silent, and Navani suspected that everyone was thinking\nalong the same lines. They couldn’t send Lift to lead an envoy representing\nthem. She was enthusiastic, yes, but … she was also … well … Lift.\n“You are excellent with healing,” Dalinar said to her, “among the best of\nyour order. We need you here, and besides, we should send someone with\npractice as a diplomat.”\n“I could give it a try, sir,” said Godeke, a shorter Edgedancer who had\nonce been an ardent. “I have some experience with these matters.”\n“Excellent,” Dalinar said.\n“Adolin and I should lead this envoy,” Shallan said. She seemed\nreluctant as she stood up. “Cryptics and honorspren don’t get along\nfantastically, but I’m a good choice regardless. Who better to represent us\nthan a highprince and his Radiant wife?”\n“An excellent suggestion,” Dalinar said. “We can send one of the\nTruthwatchers—other than Renarin—and one Stoneward. With Godeke,\nthat would give us four different Radiants and their spren, plus my own son.\nRadiant Sigzil, would that satisfy the honorspren?”\nHe cocked his head, listening to something none of the rest of them\ncould hear. “She thinks so, sir. It’s a good start, at least. She says to send\ngifts, and to ask for help. Honorspren have a difficult time turning away\npeople in need. Apologize for the past, promise to do better, and explain\nhow dire our situation is. That might work.” He paused. “It also wouldn’t\nhurt if the Stormfather were to speak on our behalf, sir.”\n“I’ll see if that can be arranged,” Dalinar said. “He can be difficult.” He\nturned to Shallan and Adolin. “You are both willing to lead this expedition?\nShadesmar is dangerous.”\n“It’s really not that bad,” Adolin said. “Assuming we’re not being chased\nthe entire time, I think it might be fun.”\nThere’s something there, Navani thought, reading the boy’s excitement.\nHe’s wanted to get back into Shadesmar for months now. But what of\nShallan? She settled down in her seat, and while she nodded to Dalinar at\nhis question, she seemed … reserved. Navani would have expected her to\nbe excited as well; Shallan loved going new and strange places.\nDalinar took their agreement, and the general lack of objections from the\nmonarchs, as enough. It was set. An expedition into Shadesmar and a large\nmilitary push into Emul—both plans unanimously agreed upon.\nNavani wasn’t certain what to think about how easily it had happened.

It\nwas nice to make headway; yet in her experience, a fair breeze one day was\nthe herald of a tempest to come.\n* * *\nShe didn’t get a chance to voice her concerns until much later in the night,\nwhen she managed to pull away from dinner with Fen and Kmakl. She tried\nto make time for the monarchs individually when she could, as Dalinar was\nso often off inspecting troops on one front line or the other.\nHe didn’t intentionally ignore social responsibilities as Gavilar had done\nat the end—in Dalinar’s case, he simply didn’t notice. And with him, that\nwas generally fine. People liked seeing him think like a soldier, and spoke\nwith fondness—rather than insult—about his occasional social missteps. He\nwas, despite having grown calmer over the years, still the Blackthorn. It\nwould be wrong if he didn’t sometimes eat his dessert with his fingers or\nunthinkingly call someone “soldier” instead of using their royal title.\nRegardless, Navani took care to make certain everyone knew that they\nwere appreciated. It was left mostly unsaid, but no one truly knew what\nDalinar’s relationship was with the coalition. Merely another monarch, or\nsomething more? He controlled the Oathgates, and almost all the Radiants\nlooked to him as their superior officer.\nBeyond that, many who had broken off from mainstream Vorinism were\ntreating his autobiography as a religious text. Dalinar wasn’t highking in\nname, just monarch of Urithiru, but the other monarchs stepped delicately\n—still wondering if this coalition would eventually become an empire\nbeneath the Blackthorn.\nNavani soothed worries, made oblique promises, and generally tried to\nkeep everyone pointed in the right direction. It was exhausting work, so\nwhen she finally trailed into their rooms, she was glad to see that Dalinar\nhad their heating fabrial warming the place with a toasty red light. He had\nunalon tea for her on the heating plate—very thoughtful, as he never\nbrewed it for himself, finding it too sweet.\nShe fetched a cup, then found him on the couch nearest the fabrial,\nstaring at its light. His jacket was off, draped across a nearby chair, and he’d\ndismissed the servants—as he usually did, and often too frequently. She’d\nneed to let them know—again—that he wasn’t offended by something\nthey’d done. He merely liked to be alone.\nFortunately, he’d made it clear that being alone didn’t include being\naway from her. He had a strange definition of the word sometimes. Indeed,\nhe immediately made space for her as she sat down, letting her melt into the\ncrook of his arm before the warm hearth. She undid the button on her\nsafehand sleeve and gripped the warm cup in both hands. She’d grown\ncomfortable with a glove these last few years, and found it increasingly\nannoying to have to wear something more formal to meetings.\nFor a time, she simply enjoyed the warmth. Three sources of it. The first\nthe warmth of the fabrial, the second the warmth of the tea, and the third the\nwarmth of him against her back. The most welcome of them all. He rested"

He rested\nhis hand along her upper arm and would occasionally rub with one finger—\nas if wanting to constantly remind himself that she was there with him.\n“I used to think these fabrials were terrible,” he eventually said,\n“replacing the life of a fire with something so … cold. Warm, yes, but cold.\nStrange, how quickly I’ve come to enjoy them. No need to keep piling on\nlogs. No worry about the flue clogging and smoke boiling out. It’s amazing\nhow much removing a few background worries can free the mind.”\n“To think about Taravangian?” she guessed. “And how he supported the\nwar proposal instead of objecting?”\n“You know me too well.”\n“I’m worried too,” she said, sipping her tea. “He was far too quick to\noffer troops. We’ll have to take them, you know. After spending months\ncomplaining he was withholding his armies, we can’t turn them away now.”\n“What is he planning?” Dalinar asked. “This is where I’m most likely to\nfail everyone, Navani. Sadeas outmaneuvered me, and I fear Taravangian is\nmore crafty in every respect. When I tried to make initial moves to cut him\nout of the coalition, he’d already worked on the others to undermine any\nsuch attempt. He’s playing me, and doing it deftly, right beneath my nose.”\n“You don’t have to face him alone,” Navani said. “This isn’t only upon\nyou.”\n“I know,” Dalinar said, his eyes seeming to glow as he stared at the\nbright ruby in the hearth. “I won’t ever suffer that feeling again, Navani.\nThat moment of standing on the Shattered Plains watching Sadeas retreat.\nOf knowing that my faith in someone—my stupid naivety—had doomed\nthe lives of thousands of men. I won’t be Taravangian’s pawn.”\nShe reached up and cupped his chin in her hand. “You suffered betrayal\nby Sadeas because you saw the man as he should have been, if he’d risen\nabove his own pettiness. Don’t lose that faith, Dalinar. It’s part of what\nmakes you the man you have become.”\n“Taravangian is confident, Navani. If he’s working with the enemy,\nthere’s a reason for it. He always has a reason.”\n“Wealth, renown. Vengeance maybe.”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “No, not him.” He closed his eyes. “When I … when\nI burned the Rift, I did it in anger. Children and innocents died because of\nmy fury. I know that feeling; I could spot it. If Taravangian killed a child,\nhe’d do it not for vengeance. Not for fury. Not for wealth or renown. But\nbecause he sincerely thought the child’s death was necessary.”\n“He would call it good, then?”\n“No. He would acknowledge it as evil, would say it stains his soul. He\nsays … that’s the point of having a monarch. A man to wallow in blood, to\nbe stained by it and destroyed by it, so that others might not suffer.”"

A man to wallow in blood, to\nbe stained by it and destroyed by it, so that others might not suffer.”\nHe opened his eyes and raised his hand to hold hers. “It’s similar, in a\nway, to how the ancient Radiants saw themselves. In the visions they\nsaid … they were the watchers at the rim. They trained in deadly arts to\nprotect others from needing to do so. The same philosophy, less tarnished.\nHe’s so close to being right, Navani. If I could only get through to him…”\n“I worry that instead he’ll change you, Dalinar,” she said. “Don’t listen\ntoo closely to what he says.”\nHe nodded, and seemed to take that to heart. She rested her head against\nhis chest, listening to his heartbeat.\n“I want you to stay here,” he said, “in the tower. Jasnah wants to deploy\nwith us into Emul; she’s eager to prove she can lead in battle. With an\noffensive so large, I’ll be needed in person as well. Taravangian knows that;\nhe must be planning a trap for us. Someone needs to be here in the tower,\nsafe—to pull the rest of us out if something goes wrong.”\nSomeone to lead the Alethi, in case Jasnah and I are killed in\nTaravangian’s trap, he left unsaid.\nShe didn’t object. Yes, an Alethi woman would normally go to war to\nscribe for her husband. Yes, he was defying this in part because he wanted\nher safe. He was a little overprotective.\nShe forgave him this. They would need a member of the royal family to\nstay in reserve, and besides, she was increasingly certain that the best thing\nshe could do to help would involve unraveling the mysteries of this tower.\n“If you’re going to leave me,” she said, “then you’d best treat me well in\nthe days leading up to your departure. So I remember you fondly and know\nthat you love me.”\n“Is there ever a question of that?”\nShe pulled back, then lightly ran her finger along his jaw. “A woman\nneeds constant reminders. She needs to know that she has his heart, even\nwhen she cannot have his company.”\n“You have my heart always.”\n“And tonight specifically?”\n“And tonight,” he said, “specifically.” He leaned forward to kiss her,\npulling her tight with those formidable arms of his. In this she encountered\na fourth warmth to the night, more powerful than all the rest.\nTHE END OF\nPart One\nSylphrena felt the energy of the approaching highstorm like one might hear\nthe sound of a distant musician walking ever closer. Calling out with\nfriendly music.\nShe zipped through the halls of Urithiru. She was invisible to almost\neveryone but those she chose—and today she chose the children. They\nnever seemed suspicious of her. They always smiled when they saw her.\nThey also rarely acted too respectful. Despite what she told Kaladin, she\ndidn’t always want people to treat her like a little deity.\nUnfortunately, this early, there weren’t a lot of people—children or not\n—out in the tower. Kaladin was still asleep, but she liked that he slept a\nlittle better now.\nShe heard noises from a particular doorway, so she went that direction,"

Kaladin was still asleep, but she liked that he slept a\nlittle better now.\nShe heard noises from a particular doorway, so she went that direction,\ndarting into the room to find Rock’s daughter cooking. The others called her\nCord, but her real name—Hualinam’lunanaki’akilu—was much prettier. It\nwas a poem about a wedding band.\nCord deserved such a pretty name. She looked so different from the\nAlethi. More solid, a person who wouldn’t be blown over by a storm, as if\nshe were made of bronze—a shade subtly reflected by her skin tone. And\nthat beautiful red hair was different from Shallan’s. Cord’s was more rusty,\ndarker and deeper; she wore it in a tail, tied with a ribbon.\nShe saw Syl, of course; she had inherited her father’s blessing of being\nable to see all spren. She paused, head bowed, and touched one shoulder,\nthen the other, then her forehead. She separated out the next slices of tuber\nshe cut and set them in a neat pile on the counter: an offering for Syl. That\nwas silly, since Syl didn’t eat. She turned into a tuber anyway and rolled\naround on the counter to say thanks.\nThat music though. The storm. She could hardly contain herself. It was\ncoming!\nShe rolled off the counter and zipped over to examine Cord’s Shardplate\nstacked neatly in the corner. The young Horneater woman was never\nwithout it. She was the first of her people in … well, a very, very long time\nto have a Shard.\nIt was pretty. Maybe Syl should have hated it, as she did Shardblades,\nbut she didn’t. It was kind of a corpse—well, lots of corpses—but not as\noffensive. The difference, she supposed, was attitude. She could sense\ncontentment, not pain, from the Plate.\nCord began making noise with her pot, and Syl found herself darting that\ndirection to watch what was being dumped into the water. Sometimes Syl\nfelt like she had two brains. One was the responsible brain; it had driven her\nto defy the other honorspren and her father in seeking out Kaladin and\nforming a Radiant bond. This was the brain that she wanted to control her. It\ncared about important things: people, the fate of the world, figuring out\nwhat it truly meant to be of Honor.\nShe had a different brain too. The brain that was fascinated by the world\n—the brain that acted like it belonged to a small child. A loud noise? Better\ngo see what caused it! Music on the horizon? Dart back and forth, eager\nwith anticipation! A strange cremling on the wall? Mimic its shape and\ncrawl along to see what it feels like!\nThoughts bombarded her. What did it feel like to be a tuber being cut?\nHow long had it taken Rock and Song to come up with Cord’s name?\nShould Syl have a name that was a poem? Maybe they had a name for her\namong the Horneaters. Did they have names for every spren, or just\nimportant ones?\nOn and on and on. She could deal with it. She always had. It wasn’t an\nhonorspren thing though. The others weren’t like her, except maybe Rua."

The others weren’t like her, except maybe Rua.\nPuffs of steam rose from the cook pot, and Syl became the same shape: a\npuff of steam rising toward the ceiling. When that got boring—it took only\na few seconds—she soared up into the air to listen to the music. The storm\nwasn’t near enough yet. She wouldn’t be able to see it.\nStill, she zipped out onto the balcony and flitted along the outside of the\ntower, searching for Kaladin’s room.\nThe tower was dead. She barely remembered the place from before,\nwhen she’d bonded her old wonderful knight. He’d spent most of his life\ntraveling to little villages, using her as a Shardblade to cut cisterns or\naqueducts for the people. She remembered coming to Urithiru with him\nonce … and the tower had been bright with lights.… A strange kind of\nlight …\nShe stopped in the air, realizing she’d flown up seventeen stories. Silly\nspren. Don’t let the child be in charge. She darted down and found\nKaladin’s window, then squeezed through the shutters, which had just\nenough space between them for her to enter.\nIn the dark room beyond, he slept. She didn’t need to come look to know\nthat. She’d have felt if he’d woken. But …\nHe has two brains too, she thought. A light brain and a dark brain. She\nwished she could understand him. He needed help. Maybe this new duty\nwould be all he needed. She so profoundly hoped that it would. But she\nworried it wouldn’t be enough.\nHe needed her help, and she couldn’t give it. She couldn’t understand.\nThe storm! The storm was here.\nShe slipped back outside, though the responsible brain managed to keep\nher attention. Kaladin. She needed to help Kaladin. Perhaps he would be\nsatisfied as a surgeon, and it would be good for him to not have to kill\nanymore. However, there was a reason he’d had difficulties as a surgeon in\nthe past. He would continue to have the dark brain. This wasn’t a solution.\nShe needed a solution.\nShe kept hold of that idea, not letting it evaporate like steam above a\ncauldron. She held to it even as the stormwall hit, washing around the base\nof the tower from the east. Hundreds of windspren flew before it in a\nmultitude of shapes. She joined them, laughing and becoming like them.\nShe loved her little cousins for their joy, their simple excitement.\nAs always, small thoughts bombarded her as she flew between them,\nwaving, smiling, changing shapes repeatedly from one moment to the next.\nHonorspren—all of the intelligent spren—were something new to Roshar.\nWell, new as in ten-thousand-years-old new. So … newer.\nHow had the first honorspren—or cultivationspren, or inkspren, or\npeakspren, or any of the other intelligent ones—been created?

Could she help them become smart?\nThese were heavy thoughts when she just wanted to soar. The music, the\ncataclysm of the storm was … strangely peaceful. She often had trouble in a\nroom full of talking people, whether they were humans or spren. She would\nbe intrigued by every conversation, her attention diverted constantly.\nOne might have thought the storm would be the same way, but it wasn’t\nloudness that bothered her—it was a diversity of loudnesses. The storm was\na single voice. A majestic, powerful voice singing a song with its own\nharmonies. In here she could simply enjoy the song and relax, renewed.\nShe sang with the thunder. She danced with the lightning. She became\ndebris and let herself be pushed along. She zipped into the inmost, darkest\npart of the storm, and she became its heartbeat. Light-thunder. Light-\nthunder. Light-thunder.\nThen blackness took her. A fuller blackness than the absence of light. It\nwas the split moment that her father could create. Time was a funny thing.\nIt was always flowing along in the background like a river, but bring too\nmuch power to bear, and it warped. It slowed; it wanted to pause and take a\nlook.

I can help him better if I know him better.”\nYOU GIVE TOO MUCH OF YOURSELF TO THAT HUMAN.\n“Isn’t that why we exist?”\nNO. YOU HAVE ALWAYS MISUNDERSTOOD THIS. YOU DO NOT EXIST FOR THEM.\nYOU EXIST FOR YOU. YOU EXIST TO CHOOSE.\n“And do you exist for you, Father?” she demanded, standing in blackness\n—insisting on holding her human form. She stared up at the deep eternity.\n“You never make choices. You merely blow as you always do.”\nI AM BUT THE STORM. YOU ARE MORE.\n“You avoid responsibility,” she said. “You claim you do only what a\nstorm must, but then act like I’m somehow wrong for doing what I feel I\nmust! You tell me I can make choices, then berate me when I make ones\nyou do not like.”\nYOU REFUSE TO ADMIT THAT YOU ARE MORE THAN AN APPENDAGE TO A\nHUMAN.

I DO NOT THINK THE WORLD WILL BEND TO YOUR WISHES.\n“Regardless, I need to understand him so I can help him,” Syl said. “Not\nbecause I’m going to be consumed by his desires, but because this is what I\nwant to do. So I ask again. Will you make me capable of feeling what he\ndoes?”\nI CANNOT DO THIS THING, the Stormfather said. YOUR WISHES ARE NOT EVIL,\nSYLPHRENA, BUT THEY ARE DANGEROUS.\n“You cannot? Or you will not?”\nI HAVE THE POWER, BUT NOT THE ABILITY.\nThe time between ended abruptly, dumping her back into the storm.\nWindspren spiraled around her, laughing and calling, mimicking the words,\n“You cannot, you cannot, you cannot!” Insufferable things. As bad as she\nwas sometimes.\nSyl kept hold of the idea, cradling it, then let herself be otherwise\ndistracted by the storm. She danced for its entire passing, though she\ncouldn’t leave with it. She needed to stay within a few miles of Kaladin, or\nher Connection to the Physical Realm would start to fade and her mind\nwould weaken.\nShe enjoyed this time, an hour passing in moments. When the riddens\nfinally approached, she stopped in eager anticipation, overjoyed. Up here in\nthe mountains, the end of the storm made snow. By now, the storm had\ndropped all its crem-laced water, so the snow was white and pure. Each\nsnowflake was so magnificent! She wished she could talk to objects like\nShallan did, and hear each one’s story.\nShe fell with the flakes, imitating them—and creating patterns unique to\nher. She could be herself, not only live for some human. The thing was,\nKaladin wasn’t just some human. She’d picked him deliberately out of\nmillions and millions. Her job was to help him. As powerful a duty as the\nStormfather’s duty to drop water and crem to give life to Roshar.\nShe soared back toward Urithiru, weaving between snowbanks, then\nshooting upward. This section to the west of the tower included deep\nvalleys and frosted peaks. She dove through the former and crested the\nlatter before looping around in circles outside the magnificent tower.\nShe eventually reached the Bondsmith’s balcony. Dalinar was always\nawake for highstorms, regardless of the hour. She landed on his balcony,\nwhere he stood in the cold. The rock at his feet was slick with water; today\nthe highstorm had been high enough to cover the lower stories of the tower.\nShe’d never seen it get to the top, but she hoped it would someday.

She\nsupposed she’d take that as a compliment.\n“Did you enjoy your storm, Ancient Daughter?” Dalinar asked.\n“I enjoyed our storm,” she said. “Though Kaladin slept through the\nentire thing, the big lug.”\n“Good. He needs more rest.”\nShe took a step toward Dalinar. “Thank you for what you did. In forcing\nhim to change. He was stuck, doing what he felt he had to, but getting\ndarker all the time.”\n“Every soldier reaches a point where he has to set down the sword. Part\nof a commander’s job is to watch for the signs.”\n“He’s different, isn’t he?” Syl said. “Worse, because his own mind fights\nagainst him.”\n“Different, yes,” Dalinar said, leaning on the railing next to her. “But\nwho is to say what is worse or better? We each have our own Voidbringers\nto slay, Brightness Sylphrena. No man can judge another man’s heart or\ntrials, for no man can truly know them.”\n“I want to try,” she said. “The Stormfather implied there was a way. Can\nyou make me understand Kaladin’s emotions? Can you make me feel what\nhe’s going through?”\n“I have no idea how to accomplish something like that,” Dalinar said.\n“He and I have a bond,” she said. “You should be able to use your\npowers to enhance that bond, strengthen it.”\nDalinar clasped his hands on the stonework before him. He didn’t object\nto her request—he wasn’t the type to reject any idea out of hand.\n“What do you know of my powers?” Dalinar asked her.\n“Your abilities are what made the original Oathpact,” she said. “And\nthey existed—and were named—long before the Knights Radiant were\nfounded. A Bondsmith Connected the Heralds to Braize, made them\nimmortal, and locked our enemies away. A Bondsmith bound other Surges\nand brought humans to Roshar, fleeing their dying world. A Bondsmith\ncreated—or at least discovered—the Nahel bond: the ability of spren and\nhumans to join together into something better. You Connect things, Dalinar.\nRealms. Ideas.

She\nthought she knew his answer already, from the way he took a breath and set\nhis jaw before speaking.\n“Even if I could do this,” he said, “it would not be right.”\nShe became a small pile of leaves, disintegrating and stirring in the wind.\n“Then I’ll never be able to help him.”\n“You can help without knowing exactly what he’s feeling. You can be\navailable for him to lean on.”\n“I try. Sometimes he doesn’t seem to want even me.”\n“That’s likely when he needs you most.

So alone that I\nstarted to drift…”\nDalinar nodded. “I suspect that Kaladin feels something similar, though\nfrom what I’ve been told about his ailment, it doesn’t have a specific cause.\nHe will sometimes start to … drift, as you put it.”\n“The dark brain,” she said.\n“An apt designation.”\nMaybe I can already understand Kaladin, she thought.

And\nmaybe, if she remembered how she’d felt during those old dark days, she\ncould help Kaladin with his current dark days.\n“Thank you,” she said to Dalinar as a group of windspren passed. She\nregarded them, and for once didn’t particularly feel like giving chase. “I\nthink you have helped.”\nSja-anat had been named Taker of Secrets long ago by a scholar no one\nremembered. She liked the name. It implied action. She didn’t simply hear\nsecrets; she took them. She made them hers.\nAnd she kept them.\nFrom the other Unmade.\nFrom the Fused.\nFrom Odium himself.\nShe flowed through the Kholinar palace, existing between the Physical\nand Cognitive Realms.

Some would\nmanifest in various forms if they resided too long in one place, or if they\nwere pulled through by strong emotions.\nNot her.\nSometimes Fused, or even common singers, would notice her. They’d\ngrow stiff, look over their shoulders. They’d glimpse a shadow, a brief\ndarkness, quickly missed. Actually seeing her required reflected light.\nIt was similar in Shadesmar. She experienced that realm at the same time\nas she experienced the Physical Realm, though both were shadowy to her.\nShe dreamed that somewhere a place existed that was completely right for\nher and her children.\nFor now, she would live here.\nShe flowed up steps in one realm, but barely moved in the other. Space\nwas not entirely equal between the realms—it wasn’t that she had a foot in\neach realm; more, she was like two entities that shared a mind. In\nShadesmar, she floated above the ocean of beads, her essence rippling. In\nthe Physical Realm, she passed among singers who worked in the palace."

In\nthe Physical Realm, she passed among singers who worked in the palace.\nSja-anat did not consider herself the most clever of the Unmade.\nCertainly she was one of the more intelligent, but that was not the same.\nSome of the Unmade—such as Nergaoul, sometimes called the Thrill—\nwere practically mindless, more like emotion spren. Others—such as Ba-\nAdo-Mishram, who had granted forms to the singers during the False\nDesolation—were crafty and conniving.\nSja-anat was a little like both. During the long millennia before this\nReturn, she’d mostly slumbered. Without her bond to Odium she had\ntrouble thinking. The Everstorm appearing in Shadesmar—long before it\nhad emerged into the Physical Realm—had revitalized her. Had let her\nbegin planning again. But she knew she was not as smart as Odium was.\nShe could keep only a few secrets from him, and she had to choose\ncarefully, clouding them behind other secrets that she gave away.\nYou sacrificed some of your children so others could live. It was a law of\nnature. Humans didn’t understand it. But she did. She …\nHe was coming.\nGod of passion.\nGod of hatred.\nGod of all adopted spren.\nSja-anat flowed into the hallway of the palace and met with two of her\nchildren, touched windspren. Humans called them “corrupted,” but she\nhated this term. She did not corrupt. She Enlightened them, showing them\nthat a different path was possible. Did not the humans revere\nTransformation—the ability of all beings to become someone new, someone\nbetter—as a core ideal of their religion? Yet they grew angry when she let\nspren change?\nHer children darted away to do her bidding, then one of her greater\nchildren manifested. A glowing and shimmering light, constantly changing.\nOne of her most precious creations.\nI will go, Mother, he said. To the tower, to this man Mraize, as you have\npromised.\nOdium will see you, she replied. Odium will try to unmake you.\nI know. But Odium must be distracted from you, as we discussed. I must\nfind my own way, my own bond.\nGo then, she said. But do not bond this human because of what I said. I\nmerely promised to send a child to investigate options. There are other\npossibilities there. Choose for yourself, not because I desire it.\nThank you, Mother, he said. Thank you for my eyes.\nHe left, following the others. Sja-anat regretted that the smaller two—the\nEnlightened windspren—were essentially distractions. Odium would see\nthem for certain.\nProtect some children.\nSacrifice others.\nA choice only a god could make.\nA god like Sja-anat.\nShe rose up, taking the form of a woman of streaming black smoke with\npure white eyes. Shadows and mist, Odium’s pure essence. If he were to\nknow the deepest secret parts of her soul, he would not be surprised. For\nshe had come from him. Unmade by his hand.\nBut as with all children, she had become more.\nHis presence came upon her like the sun piercing the clouds. Powerful,"

Powerful,\nvibrant, smothering. Some Fused in the hallway noticed it and looked\naround, though the common singers weren’t attuned enough to hear\nOdium’s song—like a rhythm but more resonant. One of the three pure\ntones of Roshar.\nShe didn’t fully understand the laws that bound him. They were ancient,\nand related to compacts between the Shards, the high gods of the cosmere.\nOdium wasn’t simply the mind that controlled the power: the Vessel. Nor\nwas he merely that power alone: the Shard. He was both, and at times it\nseemed the power had desires that were counter to the purposes of the\nVessel.\nSja-anat, a voice—infused with the tone of Odium—said to her. What\nare these spren you have sent away?\n“Those that do your bidding,” she whispered, prostrating herself by\npooling down onto the floor. “Those that watch. Those that hear.”\nHave you been speaking to the humans again? To … corrupt them with\nlies?\nThat was the fabrication she and Odium played at currently. She\npretended that she had contacted the Radiant Shallan, and a few others,\nworking on his behalf—anticipating his desires. He pretended he didn’t\nknow she had done it against his will.\nBoth knew she wanted more freedom than he would allow. Both knew\nthat she wanted to be a god unto herself. But he didn’t know for certain she\nwas taking actions to undermine him, like when she’d saved Shallan and\nher companions from death in Kholinar a year ago. She had played that off\nas accidental, and he couldn’t prove otherwise.\nIf Odium caught her in a verifiable lie, he would unmake her again. Steal\nher memory. Rip her to pieces. But in so doing, he would lose a useful tool.\nHence the game.\nWhere have you sent them? he asked.\n“To the tower, Lord. To watch the humans, as we’ve discussed. We must\nprepare for the Bondsmith’s next move.”\nI will prepare, he said. You focus too much on the tower.\n“I am eager for the invasion,” she said. “I will very much like to see my\ncousin again. Perhaps they can be awakened? Persuaded?”\nOdium had likely planned to send her on this mission, but her eagerness\nnow gave him pause. He would follow her children and see that they were\nindeed going to the tower; that would reinforce his decision. The one she\nhoped he would make right now …\nYou will not go to the tower, Odium said. He hated how she referred to\nthe Sibling—the slumbering child of Honor and Cultivation—as her cousin.\nBut we are about to make a ploy with the betrayal of the man Taravangian.\nYou will watch him.\n“I would be of much more use in the tower,” she said. “Better that I—”\nYou question? Do not question.\n“I will not question.” However, she felt a surging to the power that\nmoved within him. The mind did not like being questioned, but the\npower … It liked questions. It liked arguments. It was passion."

It liked arguments. It was passion.\nThere was a weakness here. In the division between the Vessel and the\nShard.\n“I will go wherever you demand,” she said, “my god.”\nVery well. He moved on to speak with the Nine. And Sja-anat planned\nher next steps. She had to pretend to sulk. Had to try to find a way out of\ngoing to Emul. She had to hope that she wasn’t successful.\nOdium suspected that she’d helped the Radiant Shallan. He was\nwatching to see that she didn’t contact other Radiants. So she wouldn’t.\nOnce he’d found her windspren, and unmade them to lose their minds and\nmemories, he would hopefully be content—and not see the other child\nshe’d sent.\nAnd Sja-anat herself? She would go with Taravangian and watch him as\nasked. And she would stay close.\nFor Taravangian was a weapon.\nTaravangian had long suspected he would not get a funeral. The Diagram\nhadn’t indicated this specifically—but it hadn’t said otherwise. Besides, the\nfarther they progressed, the less accurate the Diagram became.\nHe had chosen this path, however, and knew it was not the sort that led\nto a peaceful death surrounded by family. This was the sort of path that led\ninto the dark forest, full of perils. His goal had never been to emerge from\nthe other side unscathed; it had always been to simply accomplish his goal\nbefore he was killed.\nAnd he had. His city, his family, his people—they would be safe. He had\nmade a deal with the enemy that ensured Kharbranth would survive the\ncoming destruction. That had always been his end. That alone.\nTo tell himself otherwise was both foolish and dangerous.\nSo it was that he arrived at this day: the day he sent his friends away.\nHe’d had a fire built in his hearth, here in his rooms at Urithiru. A real\nhearth, with real wood, dancing with flamespren. His pyre.\nHis friends gathered for the farewell. Recently they’d been spending\nmore and more time away at Kharbranth, in order to make their eventual\ndeparture less suspicious. He’d made it seem as if they were needed to help\nrule that city now that Taravangian was focused on Jah Keved.\nBut today … today they were all here. One last time. Adrotagia, of\ncourse, kept her composure as he hugged her. She’d always been the\nstronger one. Though Taravangian was moderately intelligent today, he was\nstill overcome with emotion as they pulled apart.\n“Give my best to Savrahalidem and my grandchildren,” Taravangian\nsaid. “If they ask, tell them that I lost myself at the end and became\ninsensate.”\n“Won’t that hurt Savri more?” Adrotagia asked. “To know that her father\nis trapped among enemies, senile and confused?”\n“No, that is not my girl,” he said. “You don’t know her as I do. Tell her I\nwas singing when you last saw me. That will comfort her.” He squeezed"

That will comfort her.” He squeezed\nAdrotagia’s wrists as she held to his. How lucky was he, to have had a\nfriend for … storms, seventy-three years?\n“It shall be done, Vargo,” she said. “And the Diagram?”\nHe’d promised her a final confirmation. Taravangian released her wrists,\nthen walked to the window, passing Mrall—the enormous bodyguard was\ncrying, bless him.\nLater today, Taravangian would leave for Azir with Dalinar and Jasnah.\nSoon afterward, Taravangian’s armies—acting on Odium’s orders—would\nbetray their allies and switch sides. It was a death sentence for Taravangian,\nwho would be left surrounded by his enemies. He was bringing an army just\nthe right size to put Dalinar and the other monarchs at ease: large enough to\nconvince them Taravangian was committed, but small enough to leave them\ncertain they could capture him in the event of a betrayal.\nIt was a calculated move on Odium’s part. What powerful monarch\nwould leave himself so vulnerable?\nFeeling tired, Taravangian rested his weathered hands upon the stone\nwindowsill of his tower room. He’d asked for a room where he could look\nsouthward, to where this had all begun with a request to the Nightwatcher.\nHe now suspected that his boon had been chosen by someone more grand\nthan that ancient spren.\n“The Diagram,” Taravangian said, “has served its purpose. We have\nprotected Kharbranth. We have fulfilled the Diagram.\n“Both the book and the organization we named after it were merely\ntools. It is time to disband. Dismantle our secret hospitals; release our\nsoldiers to the city guard. If there are any middling members you think\nknow too much, give them a time-consuming ‘secret’ quest far from\ncivilization. Danlan should be among the first of this group.\n“As for Delgo, Malata, and the others too useful to waste, I think they\nwill accept the truth. We have achieved our goal. Kharbranth will be safe.”\nHe peered down at his aged hands. Wrinkles like scars for each life he’d\ntaken. “Tell them … there is nothing more pitiful than a tool that has\noutlived its usefulness. We will not simply invent something new for our\norganization to do. We must allow that which has served its purpose to die.”\n“That is all fine,” Mrall said, stepping forward, folding his arms and\nacting as if he hadn’t been crying a moment before. “But you are still our\nking. We won’t leave you.”\n“We will,” Adrotagia said softly.\n“But—”\n“Vargo has the Blackthorn’s suspicion,” Adrotagia said. “He will not be\nallowed to leave, not now. And if he did go, he would be hunted once the\nbetrayal happens. We, on the other hand, can slip away—and then be\nignored. Without him, Kharbranth will be safe.”\n“This was always the intent, Mrall,” Taravangian said, still staring out\nover the mountains. “I am the spire that draws the lightning. I am the bearer"

Kharbranth can distance itself from me once our armies in Jah\nKeved turn against the Alethi. The Veden highprinces are eager and\nbloodthirsty; each has promises from the Fused. They will perpetuate the\nfight, believing that they will be favored once Odium’s forces win.”\n“You’re being thrown away!” Mrall said. “After all you’ve done, Odium\ncasts you aside? At least go to Jah Keved.”\nNaturally, Mrall didn’t see. That was fine. These details weren’t in the\nDiagram—they were in uncharted territory now.\n“I am a diversion,” Taravangian explained. “I must go with the\nexpeditionary force into Emul. Then, when Jah Keved turns, the Blackthorn\nwill be so focused on me and the immediate threat to his soldiers that he\nwill miss whatever Odium will be attempting in the meantime.”\n“It can’t be important enough to risk you,” Mrall said.\nTaravangian had his suspicions. Perhaps Odium’s ploy would be worth\nthe cost, perhaps not. It didn’t matter. At the god’s orders, Taravangian had\nspent a year preparing Jah Keved to switch sides, promoting the people\nOdium wanted in place, moving troops into position. Now that he was done,\nTaravangian was useless. Worse, he was a potential weakness.\nAnd so, Taravangian would be given to the Alethi for execution, and his\ncorpse would be burned without a proper funeral. The Alethi gave no\nhonors to traitors.\nAcknowledging his fate hurt. Like a spear right through his gut. Odd,\nhow much that should bother him. He’d be dead, so what did he care about\na funeral?\nHe turned from the window and gave Mrall a firm handshake—then an\nunexpected hug. He gave another to short, trustworthy Maben—the servant\nwoman who had watched over him all this time. She handed him a small\nbundle of his favorite jams, all the way from Shinovar. Those were\nincreasingly rare, now that trade into the strange country had cut off. The\nDiagram indicated it was likely one or more of the Unmade had set up\nthere.\n“Too often,” Taravangian said to Maben, “those who write history focus\non the generals and the scholars, to the detriment of the quiet workers who\nsee everything done. The salvation of our people is as much your victory as\nmine.” He bowed and kissed her hand.\nFinally he turned to Dukar, the stormwarden who administered\nTaravangian’s intelligence tests each morning. His robe was as extravagant\n—and silly—as always. But the man’s loyalty remained solid as he held up\nhis pack of tests.\n“I should stay with you, sire,” he said as the nearby hearth sparked, the\nlogs shifting. “You will still need someone to test you each day.”\n“The tests are no longer relevant, Dukar,” Taravangian said gently. He\nheld up a finger. “If you stay, you will be executed—or perhaps tortured to\nget information out of me. While I promised to do whatever was necessary"

So, my final act as your king is to command you to leave.”\nDukar bowed. “My king. My eternal king.”\nTaravangian looked back to Adrotagia and unfolded a piece of paper\nfrom his pocket. “For my daughter,” he said. “She will be queen of\nKharbranth when this is through. Be certain she disavows me. This is the\nreason I’ve kept her clean. Guide her well, and do not trust Dova. Having\nmet more of the other Heralds, I’m certain Battah is not as stable as she\nseems.”\nAdrotagia took his hand one last time, then patted him on the head as\nshe’d done to annoy him in their childhood, once she had started growing\ntaller than he. He smiled, then watched as the group slowly left—bowing\none at a time.\nThey closed the door, and he was alone. He took his copy of the\nDiagram, bound in leather. Despite years of hoping, he’d never been given\nanother day like that one where he’d created this book. But that one day had\nbeen enough.\nWas it? a part of him whispered. You saved a single city.\nThe best he could do.

Please forgive formality on\nmy part, as we have not met in person. I feel new to this role, despite\nmy years holding it. You will admit to my relative youth, I think.\nRadiant marched through a chamber deep beneath Urithiru, listening to the\ncrashing sound of the waterworks and worrying about the mission Shallan\nhad agreed to undertake. Volunteering to visit the honorspren? Traveling\ninto Shadesmar?\nThat positioned them to do as Mraize had tasked them. Again.\nRadiant did not like Mraize, and she certainly didn’t trust him. However,\nshe would keep to the agreement: the will of two should be respected. Veil\nwished to participate in the Ghostbloods wholeheartedly. Shallan wanted to\nwork with them long enough to find out what they knew. So Radiant would\nnot go to Dalinar and Jasnah. The compact meant harmony, and harmony\nmeant the ability to function.\nMraize wants something out of this Restares person, Veil thought. I can\nfeel it. We need to find out what that secret is, then use it. We can’t do that\nfrom here.\nA valid enough point. Radiant clasped her hands behind her back and\ncontinued her walk along the edge of the vast reservoir as her Lightweavers\ntrained nearby. She had chosen to wear her vakama, the traditional Veden\nwarrior’s clothing. It was similar to the Alethi takama, but the skirt was\npleated instead of straight.

She wore a loose matching coat with a tight vest\nand shirt beneath.\nThe bright clothing featured vibrant blues embroidered over reds with\ngold woven between, and it had trim on the skirt. She’d noticed the Alethi\ndoing double takes—both for the variegated colors, and because she wore\nwhat was traditionally a man’s outfit. But a warrior was who she was, and\nJah Keved was her heritage. She would convey both.\nThe room echoed with a low roar. Openings high in the walls on the\nother side of the reservoir let streams gush down and crash into the basin.\nThe noise was distant enough to not disturb conversation, and the longer\nshe practiced here, the more comforting she found the sound of rushing\nwater. It was a natural thing, but contained, restrained. It seemed to\nrepresent humankind’s mastery over the elements.\nSo we must master ourselves, Radiant thought—and Veil approved.\nRadiant was careful not to think poorly of Veil. Though their methods\ndiffered, they both existed to protect and help Shallan. Radiant respected\nVeil’s efforts there. She had accomplished things Radiant could not.\nIndeed, perhaps Veil could have been persuaded to talk to Dalinar and\nJasnah. But Shallan … the idea frightened Shallan.\nThat deep wound had surprised Radiant as it began to emerge this last\nyear. Radiant was pleased with the improvement they’d made in working\ntogether, but this wound was impeding further progress. It seemed similar\nto what often happened with strength training. You eventually reached a\nplateau—and sometimes getting to new heights required more pain first.\nThey’d get through this. It might seem like regression, but Radiant was\ncertain this last knot of agony was the final answer. The final truth. Shallan\nwas terrified that the ones she loved would turn on her when they found out\nthe extent of her crimes. But she needed to confront her truths.\nRadiant would do what she could to help ease that burden. Today, that\nmeant helping prepare for the mission into Shadesmar. Veil could fulfill\nMraize’s demand and find this Restares person. Radiant would instead make\ncertain the official side of their journey—speaking to the honorspren and\npleading for them to join the war—was handled competently.\nShe turned and inspected her Lightweavers. She brought them to this\nchamber under the tower because they didn’t like to train in the standard\nsparring halls. Though Radiant would have preferred them to associate with\nother soldiers, she had reluctantly agreed to find them a more private place.\nTheir powers were … unusual, and could be distracting.\nNearby, Beryl and Darcira—two of her newer Lightweavers—changed\nfaces as they fought. Diversions, to put their opponent off guard. Curiously,\nwhen wearing new faces, both women attacked more recklessly. Many\nLightweavers, when offered a part to play, threw themselves into it\nwholeheartedly.\nIt didn’t seem they had the same mental crisis as Shallan, fortunately.\nThey just liked acting, and sometimes took it too far. If given a helmet,\nthey’d stand up and shout orders like a battle commander. Wearing the right\nface they’d argue politics, stand in front of a crowd, even lob insults at the\nmighty.

But catch either of these two women alone, wearing her own face?\nThey’d speak in muted voices and avoid crowds, seeking to curl up quietly\nand read.\n“Beryl, Darcira,” Radiant said, interrupting the women. “I like how you\nare learning to control your powers—but today’s task is to practice the\nsword. Try to watch your footwork more than your transformations.\nDarcira, when you wear a male face, you always lose your stance.”\n“Guess I feel more aggressive,” Darcira said, shrugging as her\nLightweaving puffed away, revealing her normal features.\n“You must control the face rather than let it control you,” Radiant said.\nInside she felt Shallan forming a wisecrack—the Three had their own\ntrouble with that idea. “When you’re fighting, and you intend to distract\nsomeone, don’t let that distract you as well.”\n“But Radiant,” Beryl said, waving toward her side sword, “why do we\neven have to learn to fight? We’re spies. If we have to pick up our swords,\nhaven’t we already lost?”\n“There may be times when you will need to pretend to be a soldier. In\nthat case, using the sword could be part of your disguise. But yes, fighting is\nour last resort. I would have it be a viable last resort—if you need to break\ndisguise and abandon your cover, I want you to survive and return to us.”\nThe young woman thought on that. She was a few years older than\nShallan, but a few years younger than how Radiant saw herself. Beryl\nclaimed to have forgotten her real name, she’d lived so many different lives.\nVeil had found her after hearing rumors of a prostitute working in the\nwarcamps whose face changed to match that of people her clients most\nloved.\nA hard life, but not an uncommon story for the Lightweavers. Half of\nRadiant’s band of twenty included the deserters Shallan had first recruited.\nThose men might not have forgotten their former lives, but there were\ncertainly parts in the middle they’d rather not discuss.\nBeryl and Darcira took Radiant’s tips—which were really Adolin’s tips,\ndrilled into her brain over many nights practicing—and returned to their\nsparring.\n“I couldn’t spot her Cryptic,” Radiant said as she walked away to inspect\nthe others.\n“Mmm?” Pattern said, riding on her back, right below her collar.\n“Pattern? She usually rides on the inside of Beryl’s shirt, near her skin.\nPattern doesn’t like to be seen.”\n“I’d prefer if you used the Cryptic’s other name,” Radiant said. “It’s\nconfusing, otherwise.” After being pressured, each of the other Cryptics had\npicked individual names for the humans to use.\n“I don’t understand why,” he said. “Our names are already all different. I\nam Pattern. She is Pattern. Gaz has Pattern.”\n“Those … are the same words, Pattern.”\n“But they’re not,” he said. “Mmm. I could write the numbers for you.”\n“Humans can’t speak equations as intonations,” Radiant said.\nLike most of Shallan’s team, Beryl and Darcira already had their own"

That meant they weren’t\nsquires according to the Windrunner definition. Cryptics weren’t as uptight\nas honorspren, and didn’t wait as long to start bonds. Everyone in her team\nhad one at this point, and newcomers got them quickly.\nSo her team had begun using their own terminology. Shallan was the\nMaster Lightweaver. The others were Agent Lightweavers. If someone new\njoined, they were called a squire during the short time before they acquired\na spren. Together, they’d begun calling themselves the Unseen Court. Both\nVeil and Shallan loved the title … though Radiant had noticed more than a\nfew eye rolls from Windrunners when it was mentioned.\nShe completed her round of the room, the walking portion of which was\nshaped like a crescent. She looked over her twenty agents, and started\ndeliberating on the true question at hand: Which ones should she take with\nher into Shadesmar?\nShe and Adolin had agreed that the team should be small. Shallan and\nAdolin, along with three Radiants: Godeke the Edgedancer, Zu the\nStoneward, and the Truthwatcher woman who preferred to be called by her\nnickname, the Stump. They’d bring some of Adolin’s soldiers as grooms\nand guards—and he’d choose men who hadn’t been on the mission to the\nwarcamps, just in case.\nIn addition they wanted three Lightweaver agents to Soulcast food,\nwater, and other materials. It was a practical decision, and would also give\nsome of Shallan’s people experience with Shadesmar. Radiant approved,\nbut she had to deal with one discomforting problem.\nDid the Ghostbloods really have a spy among her agents? Veil emerged\nat this contemplation, and took control. She had to prepare for the\npossibility that one of the other Lightweavers might betray her if brought on\nthis mission. There must be a spy, she thought, and it will be someone who\nwas on the mission to the warcamps. Because whoever they are, they killed\nIalai.\nShallan agreed with this. Though Radiant, for some odd reason, seemed\nuncertain at that logic.\nWell, Veil needed to figure out who the most likely candidates were—\nthen make certain they went on the mission to Shadesmar.\nWhat? Radiant thought. No, if we suspect them of being a spy, we should\nkeep them far away.\nNo, Veil replied. We keep them close. To better manipulate and watch\nthem.\nThat would be reckless.\nAnd what would you rather have, Radiant? Veil asked. An enemy you\ncan see, watch, and maybe fight—or one you leave off somewhere, doing\nwho knows what?\nThat was more of a valid point. Veil surrendered control to Shallan, who\nknew the team the best. And as she strolled through the room—her hair\nbleeding to red—she found herself planning. How did she identify which\nagents were most likely to be a spy?\nShe started by walking over to where Ishnah was sparring.

The short\nwoman’s straight black hair framed a face accented by bright red lip paint,\nand she wore an Alethi havah with a gloved hand instead of a sleeve. Ishnah\nwas one of those who had earned her Blade. By Windrunner terms, she\nshould be off gathering her own squires and making her own team—they\nseemed to assume everyone would want to follow their command structure.\nThe Unseen Court, however, didn’t care for Windrunner methods.\nInstead, the Unseen Court would remain together. A balanced team, with\nroughly equal men and women, as all but one of her new recruits over the\nyear had been female. Indeed, Shallan felt the Court was complete. Beryl\nhad been with them for nearly three months now, and Shallan hadn’t felt a\nneed to recruit anyone else. She wanted a tight-knit group. Hopefully other\ngroups of Lightweavers would come to join the Radiants—but they would\nform their own teams.\nIshnah had once wanted to join the Ghostbloods. Could the woman have\nfound her way to Mraize? Would she have agreed to watch Shallan? It was\npossible, making Ishnah a prime suspect. That hurt Shallan to consider, to\nthe point that she forced Radiant to take over again.\nWhat of Vathah? Radiant glanced toward him. The brutish former\ndeserter was the most naturally talented Lightweaver. He often used his\npowers without recognizing it—even now as he sparred with Red, he’d\nmade himself appear taller and more muscular. He had joined her under\nprotest, and never quite seemed tamed by modern society. How much of a\nbribe would it take to coax him to spy on her?\nWe’re going to have to be careful, Radiant, Shallan said from within. The\nCourt could tear itself apart thinking like this.\nSomehow Radiant had to distrust them all while encouraging them to\ntrust one another.\n“Ishnah,” Radiant said, “what do you think of the mission we’ve been\ngiven?”\nIshnah dismissed her Shardblade and walked over. “Going into the dark,\nBrightness? That place offers opportunities. The ones who master it will get\nahead quickly.”\nIt was a pragmatic but ambitious attitude. Ishnah always saw\nopportunities. Her Cryptic tended to ride about on the ornament on the end\nof the central hairspike she used to keep her braids in place. Much smaller\nthan Pattern, this one constantly made new designs on the surface of the\npale white sphere.\n“Adolin and I have decided to bring a small group,” Radiant said. “The\nhonorspren need to be met with a coalition of spren and Radiants, not an\noverwhelming group of Cryptics—particularly considering they don’t much\ncare for them.”\n“From what I’ve heard,” Ishnah replied, “the honorspren don’t much like\nanyone.”\n“This is true,” Radiant said. “But Syl has told me that while they don’t\ntrust Cryptics, honorspren don’t hate them like they do inkspren or\nhighspren. I have decided to bring three Lightweavers along with me.”\n“Can I have one of the slots?” Ishnah said. “I want to see more of the"

I have decided to bring three Lightweavers along with me.”\n“Can I have one of the slots?” Ishnah said. “I want to see more of the\nspren world.”\nMraize’s spy would volunteer for the mission, Veil noted.\n“I will consider it,” Radiant said. “If you were going to take two others,\nwho would they be?”\n“Not sure,” Ishnah said. “The more experienced would be more useful,\nbut the newer recruits could learn a lot—and we don’t expect this mission\nto be dangerous. I guess I’d ask around and see who wanted to go.”\n“A wise suggestion,” Radiant said.\nAnd a clear way to begin hunting the spy. Inside, Shallan squirmed\nagain. She hated thinking about one of her friends being a traitor.\nWell, Radiant hoped it wasn’t Ishnah. The woman had survived the fall\nof Kholinar with admirable grit. She’d stared one of the worst disasters in\nmodern history in the face and had not only weathered it, but had helped\nKaladin’s squires rescue the crown prince. She would be a great advantage\non this mission, but Radiant wasn’t certain—despite what Veil said—that\nthey wanted to bring suspicious ones along.\nShe made another quick circuit of her people, joined by Ishnah, and\ngauged their eagerness to go on the mission. Most were ambivalent. They\nwanted to prove themselves, but stories of Shadesmar disturbed them. In the\nend, she had a short list of the most eager. Ishnah, naturally. Vathah and\nBeryl, the former prostitute, and Stargyle, the male recruit she’d picked up\nbefore Beryl. A tall fellow who was talented at seeing into Shadesmar.\nThese four were already among the most suspicious, Veil thought.\nIshnah, who knows about the Ghostbloods. Vathah, who is always so quiet,\nso dark, hard to read. Beryl and Stargyle, our newest recruits—and\ntherefore least known to me and the others.\nAll had been on the mission to the warcamps. So, did she bring three of\nthese four as Veil wanted, or leave them behind as Radiant wanted? Little as\nshe wanted it right now, Shallan took control at the urging of the other two.\nShe had to make the deciding vote.\nStrong. With Veil and Radiant supporting her, she found she could face\nthis. She made her decision—she’d leave these four behind, and pick others\nwho hadn’t been on the mission to the Shattered Plains.\nShe started toward Ishnah to break the news to her, but felt something\nlike nausea. A twisting of her insides. She hunched over, then tried to\nsuppress it, embarrassed to so suddenly lose control. But then, appearing\nfoolish in front of the others was a small price to pay for an opportunity.\nAnd really, if it made them underestimate her, then what harm was done?\nVeil could use that; she could use most anything.\nVeil cleared her throat and took a few deep breaths.\n“You all right, Brightness?” Ishnah asked, walking up.\n“Fine,” Veil said. “I’ve made my decision; you’ll be joining me in\nShadesmar. Would you kindly go tell Vathah and Stargyle that I’d like them"

I’ll do as you suggested—one more practiced\nLightweaver for the resource they offer, one newer agent to learn from the\nexperience.”\n“Great,” Ishnah said. “That puts Red in charge during our absence, I\nsuppose? And I assume you could come up with some Lightweaving\nexercises everyone else can perform while we’re gone.”\n“Perfect,” Veil said.\nIshnah grinned as she hurried off. Yes, she did feel suspicious. And if\nVeil had chosen wrong? Well, she suspected the true spy would somehow\nend up on the mission anyway. Mraize would make certain of it.\nThe compact, Shallan thought. Veil … we agreed …\nBut this was important. Veil had to find out which one of them was the\nspy. She couldn’t let them stay behind and fester.\nWe don’t even know if there is a spy, Radiant said. We can’t take too\nmuch of what Mraize says as truth.\nWell, they would see. Leaving your suspected spy behind, so they could\nrun amok unwatched? They would poison her friends against her. Besides,\nonce she unmasked the actual spy, Veil could use this knowledge against\nMraize.\nShe braced herself for anger from Radiant at breaking the compact. It did\nset a dangerous precedent, didn’t it?\nThis is important to you, I see, Radiant thought. She felt strangely quiet.\nI change my vote, then. I agree to bring them with us.\nVeil found this odd. Was Radiant well? Just in case, Veil kept control.\nShe stood tall, trying to appear puffed up like Radiant always acted—as if\nshe wanted to be bigger than she was, some hulking monster in armor.\nVeil held full control all through the rest of the day. She almost let go—\nShallan was pounding at her from the inside, and that kind of mental\ndoublethink could really wear a woman down. However, Veil needed to see\nto the rest of the preparations. The mission would be leaving in mere days.\nOnly when Veil stepped into her rooms—late into the evening—did she\nbegin to relax her grip. However, on the floor inside the room she found a\ngreen feather. Mraize?\nIt was a sign. Veil scanned the room, and her eyes landed on a dresser\nnear the door to the bedroom. A green cloth peeked from one of the\ndrawers.\nHolding an amethyst mark for light, she eased the drawer open. Inside\nshe found a metal cube roughly the size of a person’s head. The note on it\nwas in one of Mraize’s ciphers.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said from where he dimpled the skirt of her vakama.\n“What is it, Veil?”\nDamnation. She’d hoped to be able to fool Pattern into thinking she was\nShallan, but of course he saw through her.\n“A note.” She showed it to him, holding the light near the text. “Can you\nbreak the cipher, or do I have to go dig out the notebook Mraize gave us?”"

It reads, ‘Spanreeds do not work between\nrealms, but this will. Be very careful with it. It has a value beyond that of\nsome kingdoms. Do not open it, or you risk destroying it. Once on your\nmission and in a secluded place, hold the cube and call my name. I will\nspeak to you through it. Good hunting, little knife.’”\nCurious. She immediately glimpsed into Shadesmar, and found a sphere\nof light on the other side, glowing with a strange mother-of-pearl coloring.\nThere was power inside the cube, but no Stormlight. Her attention back to\nthe Physical Realm, she shook it and knocked on the sides. It seemed\nhollow, but she couldn’t find the slightest crack in it.\nStorms. How was she going to hide this from Adolin? Well, she’d have\nto find a way. She would make another trip into Shadesmar, but not by\naccident. Veil would go on her terms—and she would not spend this trip\nrunning.\nThis time, she was the hunter.\nI have been fascinated to discover how much you’ve accomplished on\nScadrial without me noticing your presence. How is it that you hide\nfrom Shards so well?\nChoosing an outfit for the day was a lot like fighting a duel. In both,\ninstincts—rather than conscious decisions—were the key to victory. Adolin\ndidn’t often fret about what to wear; nor did he plan each strike of the\nsword. He went with what felt right.\nThe real trick in both cases was making the effort to build your instincts.\nYou couldn’t parry a thrust with muscle memory if you hadn’t spent years\npracticing those maneuvers. And you couldn’t rely on your gut in fashion\nchoices if you hadn’t already spent hours studying the folios.\nThat said, once in a while your instincts locked up. Even he sometimes\nhesitated in a duel, uncertain. And similarly, some days he simply couldn’t\ndecide upon the right jacket.\nAdolin stood in his underclothing as he held up the first jacket.\nTraditional: Kholin blue with white cuffs. Bold white embroidery, with his\nglyphs—the tall tower and a stylized version of his Blade—on the back. It\nmade him easy to see in battle. It was also boring.\nHe glanced at the trendy yellow jacket on his bed. He’d ordered that\ntailored after the fashions he’d seen in Kholinar. It didn’t fully button\nclosed, and it had silver embroidery up the sides and covering the pocket\nand cuffs. Storms, it was bold. Daring. A bright yellow outfit? Most men\ncouldn’t ever have pulled it off.\nAdolin could. Walk into a feast wearing something like this, and you\nwould own everyone’s attention. Look confident, and at the next feast half\nthe men would be trying to imitate you.\nHe wasn’t going to a feast though. He was starting out on an important\nmission into Shadesmar.

She wore\nVeil’s clothing—trousers, long loose jacket, a buttoned shirt. At his\nsuggestion she’d replaced the white trousers and jacket with a more\npractical tan and blue ensemble. White wouldn’t travel well; she wanted\nsomething more rugged, something that wouldn’t show the dirt. Blue and\ntan matched her white hat, though he’d added a leather band around the\nbase of the crown.\nClothing notwithstanding, she wasn’t Veil today—not with the red hair.\nPlus, he could usually tell by the way she looked at him. It had been three\ndays since she’d chosen her members for the team, but it was only today\nthat they were finally ready to leave.\nShallan leaned against the door, folding her arms and surveying his\nwork. “You know,” she said, “a girl could get jealous over how much\nattention you give a choice like this.”\n“Jealous?” Adolin said. “Of jackets?”\n“Of the one you’re wearing them for.”\n“I doubt you have anything to worry about from a group of stuffy old\nhonorspren.”\n“I don’t have anything to worry about regardless,” Shallan said. “But\nyou’re not fussing today because of the honorspren. We won’t meet them\nfor a few weeks at best.”\n“I’m not fussing. I’m strategizing.” He tossed another jacket onto the\nbed. No. Too outdated. “Don’t give me that look. Are we ready?”\n“Pattern’s run off to say goodbye to Wit for some reason,” she said.\n“Said it was very important—but I suspect that he’s misunderstood some\njoke Wit made. Other than waiting on him, everything is ready. We just\nneed you.”\nSupplies were gathered, transportation secured, and traveling\ncompanions chosen. Adolin had packed for the trip quickly and efficiently,\nand his trunks were already loaded. Those choices had been easy. But\ntoday’s jacket …\n“So…” Shallan said. “Shall I tell them two more hours or three?”\n“I’ll be down in fifteen minutes,” he promised, checking the fabrial clock\nset in the leather bracer Aunt Navani had given him. Then he eyed Shallan.\n“Maybe thirty.”\n“I’ll tell them an hour,” Shallan said, with a grin. She trailed out, tossing\nher satchel over her shoulder.\nAdolin put his hands on his hips and surveyed his options. None of them\nwere right. What was he looking for?\nWait. Of course.\nHe emerged from his room a few minutes later wearing a uniform he\nhadn’t put on in years. It was Kholin blue, still a military outfit, but cut for a\nmore relaxed fit. Though not specifically trendy, it had a more stylized set\nof glyphs on the back and thicker cuffs and collar than a standard uniform.\nMany would have simply assumed it to be an ordinary Kholin uniform.\nAdolin had designed it himself four years earlier. He’d wanted to create\nsomething that would look sharp while satisfying his father’s requirements\nto be in uniform. The project had excited him for weeks; it had been his first\n—and only—real attempt at clothing design.\nThe first day he’d worn it, Dalinar had chewed him out. So it had gone"

So it had gone\ninto the trunk, tucked away. Forgotten.\nFather probably still wouldn’t approve, but these days Dalinar didn’t\napprove of Adolin in general. So what was the harm? He replaced his arm\nbracer, strapped on his side sword, and entered the hallway. Then he\nhesitated.\nShallan had given him an hour, and there was something else Adolin\nwanted to check off his list before leaving. So he turned the other direction\nand climbed the steps toward the sixth floor.\n* * *\nAdolin was surprised to find a line at the clinic. The sixth floor wasn’t\nparticularly well populated, but news had apparently spread. None of the\nwaiting patients seemed too unfortunate—children cradling scrapes, with\nhovering parents nearby. A line of women with coughs or aches. Anything\nserious would warrant the attention of an Edgedancer or a Truthwatcher.\nSome bowed to Adolin as he slipped into the front room, where\nKaladin’s mother was greeting each patient and recording their symptoms.\nShe smiled at Adolin, holding up two fingers, and waved him down the\nhallway beyond.\nAdolin went that direction. The first room he passed had the door\ncracked, revealing Kaladin’s father seeing a young man. A town girl stood\nnext to him, reading aloud the notes Lirin’s wife had taken.\nThe second room along the hallway was a similar—but empty—exam\nroom. Adolin slipped in, and Kaladin entered a few minutes later, drying his\nhands on a cloth. It was odd to see him in simple brown trousers and a\nwhite buttoned shirt—in fact, had Adolin ever seen Kaladin out of uniform?\nHonestly … Adolin had assumed the man slept in the thing. Yet here he\nwas, with sleeves rolled up to his elbows, his shoulder-length hair pulled\nback into a tail.\nKaladin stopped when he saw Adolin. “You can go to your brother for\nhealing, Adolin. I have real patients that need help.”\nAdolin ignored the comment and glanced out into the hallway, looking\ntoward the waiting room. “You’re a popular fellow, bridgeboy.”\n“I’m convinced half of them are here to get a peek at me,” Kaladin said,\nwith a sigh. He tied on a white surgeon’s apron. “I fear my notoriety could\novershadow the clinic’s purpose.”\nAdolin chuckled. “Be careful. Now that I’ve vacated the position, you’re\nAlethkar’s most eligible bachelor. Shardbearer, Radiant, Landed, and\nsingle? I wouldn’t be surprised to hear that half the young ladies in the\nkingdom are suddenly coming down with headaches.…” He trailed off as\nhe noticed Kaladin’s frown.\n“It’s already happened, hasn’t it!” Adolin said, pointing.\n“I … had wondered why so many lighteyed women suddenly needed\nmedication,” he said. “I’d thought that maybe their personal surgeons had\nbeen recruited into the war.…” He glanced at Adolin, then blushed.\n“You can be deliciously naive sometimes, Kal,” Adolin said. “You need\nto use this angle. Work it.”"

He walked over to begin arranging the medications\nand bandages on the shelf, where sphere lanterns glowed with a pure white\nlight.\nSyl winked into existence beside Adolin’s head, forming from luminous\nmist, as if she were a Shardblade. “This is good for him,” she said, leaning\nin. “He’s actually relaxing for once.”\n“There aren’t many serious cases,” Kaladin said, his back to them. “It\ncan be grueling with so many people in line, but … it isn’t as tense as I\nworried it would be.”\n“It’s working,” Syl continued, landing on Adolin’s shoulder. “His parents\nare always around, so he’s almost never alone. He still has nightmares, but I\nthink he’s getting more sleep.”\nAdolin watched Kaladin fold bandages, then noticed how Kaladin\nglanced at the surgery knives laid out in a row. He shouldn’t keep them out\nlike that, should he?\nAdolin made a sudden motion, standing up straight from where he’d\nbeen leaning against the door, his feet scraping the stone. Kaladin\nimmediately reached for the knives, then glanced back, and—seeing\nnothing was wrong—relaxed.\nAdolin walked over and put his hand on Kaladin’s shoulder. “Hey,” he\nsaid. “It chases us all. Including me, Kal.” He fished in his pocket, then\nbrought out a metal disc about an inch across. He held it toward Kaladin. “I\ndropped by to give you this.”\n“What is it?” Kaladin asked, taking the disc. One side was engraved with\na picture of a divine figure in robes, while the other side bore the same\nfigure in battle gear. Both were surrounded by strange foreign glyphs. It had\nbeen coated with some colored enamel at one point, but that had mostly\nworn off.\n“Zahel gave it to me when I finished my training with him,” Adolin said.\n“Says it’s from his homeland—they use these things as money. Weird, eh?”\n“Why don’t they use spheres?”\n“Maybe they don’t have enough gemstones? He’s from somewhere to\nthe west. He doesn’t look like a foreigner though, so I’m guessing it must\nbe Bavland.”\n“This side might be a Herald,” Kaladin said, squinting at the strange\nglyphs. “What does it say?”\n“‘War is the last option of the state that has failed,’” Adolin said, tapping\nthe side with the divine robed figure. He pushed it to spin it in Kaladin’s\nfingers, showing the other side. “‘But it is better than having no options.’”\n“Huh,” Kaladin said."

He said that if he truly believed in stopping\nwar, he’d walk away from the sword completely. Then he gave me the disc,\nand I knew he understood. In a perfect world, no one would have to train\nfor battle. We don’t live in a perfect world.”\n“How does this relate to me?” Kaladin asked.\n“Well, there’s no shame in you taking time away from the sword. Maybe\npermanently. All the same, I know you enjoy it.”\n“I shouldn’t enjoy killing,” Kaladin said softly. “I shouldn’t even enjoy\nthe fight. I should hate it like my father does.”\n“You can hate killing and enjoy the contest,” Adolin said. “Plus there are\npractical reasons to keep your skills up. Take these months to relax. When I\nreturn though, let’s find a chance to spar together again, all right? I want\nyou to see what I see in duels. It’s not about hurting others. It’s about being\nyour best.”\n“I … don’t know if I can ever think like you do,” Kaladin said. He\nwrapped his fist around the metal disc. “But thank you. I’ll keep the offer in\nmind.”\nAdolin clapped him on the shoulder, then glanced toward Syl. “I need to\nbe off into Shadesmar. Any last tips for me?”\n“Be careful, Adolin,” she said, flitting up into the air. “My kind aren’t\nlike highspren—we don’t look to laws, but to morality, as our guide.”\n“That’s good, isn’t it?” Adolin said.\n“It is … unless you happen to disagree with their interpretation of\nmorality. My kind can be very difficult to persuade with logic, because for\nus … well, what we feel can often be more important to us than what we\nthink. We’re spren of honor, but remember, honor is—even to us—what\nhumans and spren define it to be. Particularly with our god dead.”\nAdolin nodded. “Right, then. Kal, don’t let anyone burn the tower down\nwhile I’m away.”\n“You should have been the surgeon, Adolin,” Kaladin said. “Not me. You\ncare about people.”\n“Don’t be silly,” Adolin said, pulling open the door as he gestured at\nKaladin’s work clothing. “I could never dress like that.” He left Kaladin\nwith a wink.\n* * *\nAdolin strode out the front gate of Urithiru’s imposing tower and entered\nthe chill air of the plateau.

These Oathgates were portals to places around the world. Currently\nonly four functioned: the ones to the Shattered Plains, Thaylenah, Jah\nKeved, and Azir.\nA group had gathered on the platform leading to the Shattered Plains, but\nthey wouldn’t travel to that destination. This was just the gate where\nAdolin’s team would enter Shadesmar. His breath puffing before him,\nAdolin jogged over to the ramp, where his armorers were packing his\nShardplate in its traveling chest, cushioned with straw. Though the stuff was\nas hard as stone, they always took the utmost care with it. There was a\ncertain reverence due to a Shard.\n“It’s not going to make the transfer, Brightlord,” one armorer warned\nhim. “When you go to Shadesmar, it will be left behind on the platform. It’s\nbeen tested on several suits already.”\n“My armor might act differently,” Adolin said. “I want to be sure. If it\ndoes fail to make the trip, send it along with Father and his expeditionary\nforce. He’ll lend it to Fisk, to complement his Blade.”\nThe armorers saluted. Nearby, a few other stragglers were hurrying up\nthe slope to the Oathgate—including Shallan’s newest agent, a tall Alethi\nwoman with excellent taste in dresses. She carried a pack over her shoulder,\nbut … she wasn’t going on the trip, was she?\n“Beryl?” Adolin called to her as she passed. “Wasn’t Stargyle chosen to\nmake this journey?”\n“Oh, Brightlord!” the darkeyed woman said. “Stargyle’s wife has come\ndown with a sickness. He wants to stay with her, so we decided I should go\ninstead.”\nHuh. He nodded absently as the woman hurried up the slope. Shallan had\nseemed very particular about whom she wanted to bring. Hopefully this\nhadn’t upset her plans.\nWell, nothing to do about it. He stepped over to a tall black horse\nstanding at the ready. Gallant was surrounded by Adolin’s grooms, who\nwere preparing to strap equipment to the horse’s back—including Adolin’s\nweapons and his trunk of clothing. The horse should have been loaded\nalready. Adolin stepped up to the Ryshadium and stared into his watery blue\neyes—which, if he looked closely, had a faint swirl of rainbow colors to\nthem.\nThe horse glanced at the pack straps the porters were affixing onto his\nback; they required stools to get high enough.\n“What?” Adolin asked.\nThe horse blew out, then glared at the straps again.\n“You think because we’re royalty, we’re above doing a little labor?”\nAdolin pointed at the horse, meeting his eyes. “It’s like Father always says.\nNever be unwilling to do something you might ask another to do for you.”\nHe reached into his pocket and pulled out a palafruit. “Here.”\nThe horse turned away.\n“Fine,” Adolin said. “I’ll have them saddle up one of the common horses\ninstead.

Nearby one of the grooms watched, baffled, until one of the others\nnudged him.\n“I talk to my sword too,” Adolin told them. “Funny thing is, she\neventually talked back. Never be afraid to show a little respect to those you\ndepend upon, friends.”\nThe two grooms scuttled away as two workmen hitched Adolin’s armor\nboxes into place on one side of the horse.\n“Thank you,” Adolin said to Gallant. “For being with me. I know you’d\nrather be with Father.”\nThe horse blew out, then reached his muzzle into Adolin’s hand.\nRyshadium chose their riders; they were not broken or trained. They\naccepted you, or they did not—and it was very rare for one to allow two\nriders.\nFather loved his horse, he really did. But he was so busy with meetings\nthese days, and Gallant seemed so forlorn. Abandoned, just a little. And\nwell … Adolin had his own loss he was dealing with. So it had seemed a\nnatural pairing, one that over the months had become more and more\nstrong.\nThe grooms finished with the armor trunks, and then hooked Adolin’s\nclothing trunk on the other side. That wasn’t nearly as heavy as the Plate, so\nto weight that side roughly equal, a worker approached with a long box.\nAdolin stopped him, wanting to do one last check. He knelt to undo the\nlatches and peeked inside.\n“Storms,” a voice said. “Pardon, Brightlord, but how many swords do\nyou need?”\nAdolin grinned up at Godeke the Edgedancer, who was leading his horse\nnearby. The slender man wore his hair cropped short, though he wasn’t\ntechnically an ardent any longer, and so didn’t need to shave it. Beyond\nhim, Zu—the team’s Stoneward—was lifting her pack onto her back. The\ngolden-haired woman continually complained about the cold, and huddled\nin a coat several sizes too large.\n“Well,” Adolin said to Godeke, “you can never have too many swords.\nBesides, no Shardblades can enter Shadesmar, so a man must be prepared.”\n“You’re wearing a sword.”\n“This?” Adolin said, patting his side sword. “Oh sure, this is better than\nnothing, but I’d hate to be caught with just it and no buckler. Besides, I’ve\ntrained to duel mostly on longswords and greatswords.” He pulled his\ngreatsword out of his arms box; the long weapon was intended to be used\ntwo-handed. It wasn’t as long as some Shardblades, of course, nor as wide.\n“I don’t … know how much dueling you’ll be doing, Brightlord.”\n“Obviously,” Adolin said. “That’s why I need these others.” He handed it\nto the groom. “Fix its scabbard to Gallant’s left shoulder, its guard in line\nwith the saddle.” To Godeke, he continued, “See here, a hand-and-a-half"

A nice swordstaff for horseback—\nI can screw in this piece to make it longer…”\n“I see.”\n“Here, this is an Emuli kusu,” Adolin said, holding up the long curved\nsword. “Great for slicing and cutting, especially when doing ride-by\ncharges. Easier to withdraw the blade and better against someone\nunarmored. And here, I need this Veden house sword if we end up fighting\nagainst mail.…”\n“I should be—”\n“Don’t forget Shardbearers,” Adolin said, hefting a warhammer. It\nlooked small, almost like a workman’s hammer with a longer handle—so\ntiny compared to the massive Shardbearers’ hammers wielded by men in\nPlate. He didn’t want to make Gallant haul one of those on their trip. “Need\nthis if I end up being forced to crack some Plate—the swords will simply\nbreak, except maybe the house sword. Might be able to get that through a\ncrack, once the armor is weakened.”\n“I really—”\n“And here, see this one?” He pulled out a unique triangular weapon,\ngripped at the base with a kind of handle instead of a true hilt. “Thaylen\ngtet. I’ve always wanted to train with one of these. Figured I might get\nsome practice in.”\nGodeke waved to someone farther up the ramp, then hastily said farewell\nbefore hiking off, tugging his horse after him. Adolin grinned, then had the\nworkers hang a few more weapons from the horse’s saddle. Gallant tapped\nhis hooves with what seemed to be satisfaction, happier to be outfitted with\nproper weapons and not just luggage. The workers affixed the box with the\nrest in place.\n“You seem almost pleased,” Zu said, strolling over in her oversized coat.\n“To not be able to use Shardblades, I mean.”\nAdolin hadn’t spoken to the woman much; he hadn’t realized how good\nher Alethi was. Apparently her people had turned her out when her powers\nhad first manifested several years ago—they hadn’t realized she was a\nRadiant, and had thought her cursed by some strange god whose name\nAdolin hadn’t recognized.\nThe Iriali fought for the enemy now, but Dalinar didn’t turn away anyone\nwho came asking for asylum—particularly if they’d said Radiant oaths.\n“Well,” Adolin said, “I wouldn’t say happy. A Shardblade is the superior\nweapon. No amount of specialization for the situation can make up for the\nability to slice through your opponent’s weapons, armor, even body as if\nthey were water. I love wielding mine in duels; there’s just a part of me that\nregrets that it makes other weapons obsolete.”\n“I disagree,” Zu said, summoning her Blade. “Why would you ever\nregret the existence of one of these?” It appeared in her hand upon her\ncommand, forming from mist.

She preferred a slender Blade, even longer\nthan his father’s, with a wicked curve to it.\nAdolin stood up, breathing heat into his hands as Merit began leading the\npack animals up the ramp onto the Oathgate platform. Adolin glanced at\nGallant; the horse clopped off to follow, needing no bridle or rope to guide\nhim.\nZu waved her sword overhead slowly in a kind of kata that caught the\nsun. It transformed in her hands, becoming smaller and shorter—like his\nside sword—then became straight, with a tip for thrusting. The fact that\nliving Shardblades could change shapes explained a lot to Adolin.\nThe ancient Shardblades—the dead ones that most Shardbearers used—\nwere locked, apparently into the last shape they’d held. Most were massive\nthings, not clunky—a Shardblade could never be clunky—but also not\nparticularly well suited to most battlefield actions. They were light, yes, but\nthe size could be unwieldy nonetheless.\nModern Radiants preferred functional weapons when actually fighting.\nHowever, when they wanted to show off, they created something majestic\nand otherworldly—something that was less about practicality and more\nabout awe. That indicated most Shardblades, his own included, had\npractical forms—but had been abandoned in their more showy styles.\n“I didn’t mean to imply there’s not art to a Shardblade,” Adolin told Zu.\n“I truly love Shardblade duels. I just love finding the best weapon for the\njob. And when that answer isn’t always the same sword, it’s more\nsatisfying.”\n“You should become a Radiant,” she said. “Then your sword would\nalways be the right weapon for the job.”\n“As if it were that easy,” Adolin said. “Just become a Radiant.”\nHis equipment seen to, Adolin did a quick head count. Six of his soldiers\nwere coming as guards and workers—darkeyed men specifically chosen\nbecause they had good heads on their shoulders. Adolin didn’t pick the best\nduelists; he chose men who could cook and do laundry in the field. Most\nimportantly, he needed men who wouldn’t balk at oddities.\nFelt was the best of them, an older foreign man, one of Dalinar’s friends\nfrom the early days. He was steady and reliable, and had training as a scout.\nMerit was a groom, and Urad was an excellent hunter, should they need to\nforage. Adolin wasn’t certain how useful that would be in Shadesmar, but\nbest to be prepared.\nFelt’s wife, Malli, worked in the quartermaster’s office, and was along to\nact as a scribe. No actual servants, though Shallan’s three Lightweavers did\nodd jobs for her.\nThat left the three full Radiants. Godeke and Zu he’d already checked\non. Asking around, Adolin found that their final Radiant—a Tashikki\nwoman—had returned to the tower to check on something. So he idled near\nthe ramp, waiting until he saw her crossing the plateau.\nThe woman had to be in her seventies, with dark brown furrowed skin\nand silver hair. She was slender, but not frail.

Though he’d seen\nher wearing a Tashikki wrap in the tower before, today she wore rugged\ntraveling clothing and a shawl over her hair, with a pack slung over one\nshoulder. As she approached, Adolin reached to help her carry it, but she\ntightened her fingers.\nShe didn’t speak much Alethi, but most of the spren were able to speak\nseveral human languages. He wasn’t certain if it was an aspect of their\nnature, or if they simply lived so long that they ended up picking up\nmultiple languages.\nEither way, the spren could translate if necessary, and Adolin really did\nwant to bring a Truthwatcher. They had once been well-regarded by the\nhonorspren. Though the woman’s name was Arshqqam, everyone called her\nthe Stump—a nickname that Lift had spread, he believed. Arshqqam had\nmentioned she was fond of the name, and the way she strode—unbowed by\nage, insisting on carrying her own things—gave him an inkling of where the\nmoniker had come from.\nWith her arrival, the entire expedition was accounted for. A half dozen\npack animals weren’t many for fifteen people. Normally he’d have expected\nthat many animals for just the food, plus some wagons carrying\nstormbarrels that could be chained down to catch rainwater. Fortunately,\nthis group had Shallan’s Lightweavers to provide food and water through\nSoulcasting.\nAs Adolin crossed the platform, he passed the queen standing—as\nalways—with Wit at her shoulder. She, Dalinar, and Taravangian were the\nonly monarchs at the tower today, and they’d all come to see off the\nexpedition. Jasnah was supervising Ishnah and Vathah, two of Shallan’s\nagents, determining for herself if they were capable.\nAdolin lingered as Vathah knelt beside a large block of obsidian. The\nglassy stone had been mined in Shadesmar and brought through for the test.\nVathah’s hand sank into the block, and then the structure of the obsidian\nchanged—in the blink of an eye, the rock transformed into grain. Kind of.\nWhat Vathah made was a large square lump of hardened lavis pulp, not\nindividual seeds like some advanced Soulcasters could make. They could\ncut off chunks, cook it to mush. It wasn’t tasty, but it was hearty and\nhealthy.\nDo they know? Adolin wondered. How much Jasnah sees them as tools?\nFor centuries the Alethi Soulcasting devices—limited though they were—\nhad given his kingdom an unparalleled edge in battle. Now, Lightweavers\nwere Soulcasting and didn’t seem to suffer the same ill effects as users of\nthe devices.\nAdolin could see deeper motives in the months Jasnah had spent training\nShallan and her agents. Though Shallan wanted her team to become spies,\nJasnah seemed to see their powers of illusion as a distant second to their\nability to feed armies.\nHopefully the cache of Soulcasting devices found in Aimia would relieve\nsome of that pressure.

Shallan watched from the near distance, sitting on a\nsupply box, her expression unreadable. Though by far the most talented at\nillusions among her people, Shallan’s own abilities in Soulcasting had\nproven … erratic. Adolin had peeked in on her sessions to see only\noccasional lumps of grain. Other times, she accidentally created twisted\nthings: flames, sometimes pools of blood, once a translucent crystal.\nJasnah had finally, after eight months of work, officially released Shallan\nfrom her wardship. And Shallan truly had earned that release. She’d gone to\nlessons, memorized the works of scholars, and acted as the perfect ward.\nThough mastery of Soulcasting eluded her, she had improved over the year.\nJasnah dismissed the two agents, who hastened to join the others. Adolin\nfound himself growing anxious as everyone gathered around the small\nbuilding at the center of the platform. Not that he had any reason. It was just\nthat it had been months since he’d last visited Shadesmar.\nDalinar stepped up to the group and waited for everyone to quiet. He\nwould want to speak, of course. Adolin’s father could turn anything into an\nexcuse for an inspirational speech.\n“I commend your bravery,” Dalinar said to the gathered people. “Know\nthat you go representing not only me, but the entire coalition. With you go\nthe hopes of millions.\n“The realm you traverse will be alien and at times hostile. Do not forget\nthat it once held allies, and their fortresses welcomed men with open arms.\nYour task is to rekindle those ancient alliances, as we have re-formed the\nancient bond between nations. Know that you take with you my utmost\nconfidence.”\nNot bad, Adolin thought. At least it was short. Adolin’s six men cheered\nas expected. The Radiants applauded politely, which generally wasn’t the\nresponse that one of Dalinar’s rousing speeches received. He continued to\ntreat them like soldiers, though most of the Radiants here today had never\nbeen in the military. Shallan was a country lighteyes and scholar turned spy;\nthe Stump had run an orphanage; Godeke had been an ardent. So far as\nAdolin knew, Zu was the only one who had held anything resembling a\nweapon before saying her oaths.\nJasnah said a few words, and so did Taravangian. Adolin listened with\nhalf an ear, wondering if Taravangian found it odd that the expedition\nwasn’t taking any Dustbringers. No one had spoken the reason, but it was\nobvious to Adolin. The Dustbringers didn’t serve Dalinar, at least not\nloyally enough for his taste.\nAt the end of the speeches, the members of the expedition began\nsqueezing into the small control building, leading the horses in as well.\nThere might be some way to bring everyone on the platform into\nShadesmar, but so far they’d been limited to people standing in the small\ncontrol building.\nAdolin waved for Shallan to go in first without him. Jasnah,\nTaravangian, and Wit began to retreat across the platform with their\nattendants. Soon, Adolin and Dalinar stood facing one another, alone\noutside the building."

Soon, Adolin and Dalinar stood facing one another, alone\noutside the building.\nA snort broke the air. Gallant had lingered, refusing the grooms who\ntried to coax him into the building with fruit. Dalinar broke his stern posture\nand patted the horse on the neck. “Thank you,” he said to Adolin, “for\ncaring for him these last months. I don’t get much time for riding these\ndays.”\n“We both know how busy you are, Father.”\n“That’s a new uniform,” Dalinar said to him. “Better than some you’ve\nbeen wearing lately.”\n“That’s amusing,” Adolin said. “Four years ago when I last wore this,\nyou called it disgraceful.”\nDalinar stiffened, lowering his hand from Gallant’s neck. Then he\nclasped his hands behind his back and stood tall. So storming tall.\nSometimes Adolin’s father was more like a Soulcast statue than a person.\n“I guess … we’ve both become more lax over the years,” Dalinar said.\n“I think I’ve stayed the same person,” Adolin said. “I’m just more\nwilling to let you be disappointed by that person.”\n“Son,” Dalinar said, “I’m not disappointed in you.”\n“Aren’t you? Can you say that truthfully, with an oath?”\nDalinar fell silent. “I merely want you to be the best man you can be,” he\nfinally said. “A better man than I was at your age. I know that’s the person\nyou really are. And I want you to represent me well. Is that such a terrible\nthing?”\n“I don’t represent you anymore, Father. I’m a highprince. I represent\nmyself. Is that such a terrible thing?”\nDalinar sighed. “Don’t go down this road, son. Do not let my failings\ndrive you to rebel against what you know is right, merely because it’s what\nI wish of you.”\n“I’m not—” Adolin made fists, trying to squeeze out his frustration. “I’m\nnot simply rebelling, Father. I’m not fourteen anymore.”\n“No. When you were fourteen you looked up to me for some reason.”\nDalinar glanced after the departing figures, growing small on the platform.\n“You see Taravangian out there? Do you know how he sees the world? Any\ncost, any price, is worth paying if what you want to achieve is—in the end\n—worthy.\n“Follow him, and you’ll be able to justify anything. Lying to your\nsoldiers? Necessary, to get them to do their work. Gathering wealth? You\nneed it to further your important goals. Killing innocents? All to forge a\nstronger nation.” He eyed Adolin. “Murdering a man in a back alley, then\nlying about it? Well, the world is better off without him. In fact, there are a\nlot of people this world could do without. Let’s start removing them\nquietly.…”\nMaybe I murdered Sadeas, Adolin thought. But at least I never killed\nanyone innocent. At least I didn’t burn my own wife to death.\nThere it was. The seething knot deep inside him, the one Adolin didn’t\ndare touch lest it burn him. He knew Dalinar had been a different man then."

He knew Dalinar had been a different man then.\nA man not in his right mind, betrayed, consumed by the power of one of the\nUnmade. Besides, Dalinar hadn’t killed Adolin’s mother on purpose.\nOne could know these things without feeling them. And this. Wasn’t.\nSomething. You. Forgave.\nAdolin shoved that furious knot down and didn’t let it rule him, ignoring\nthe angerspren at his feet. He said nothing to his father. He didn’t trust the\nanger, the frustration, and—yes—the shame churning within. If he opened\nhis mouth, one of the three might come out, but he couldn’t say which.\n“You either believe as Taravangian does,” Dalinar said, “or you accept\nthe better path: that your actions define you more than your intentions. That\nyour goals and the journey used to attain them must align. I’m trying to stop\nyou before you do some things you will truly, sincerely regret.”\n“And if I think the actions I’ve taken are worthy?” Adolin said.\n“Then perhaps we need to consider that my training of you in your youth\nwas faulty. That is not surprising. I was not exactly the best of examples.”\nIt’s about you again, Adolin thought. I can’t have an opinion or make\nchoices—I’m only acting like this because of your influence.\nKelek, Jezerezeh, and Heralds above! Adolin loved his father. Even now,\nwith everything he’d learned about what Dalinar had done. Even with …\nthat event. He loved his father. He loved that Dalinar tried so hard, and he\nhad become someone far better than he’d once been.\nBut Damnation. This last year, Adolin had begun to realize how difficult\nit could be to live around the man.\n“Maybe,” Adolin said, calming himself with effort. “Maybe—incredible\nthough it may seem—there are more than two choices in life. I’m not you,\nbut that doesn’t mean I’m Taravangian. Maybe I’m my own brand of\nwrong.”\nDalinar rested his hand on Adolin’s shoulder. It should have been\ncomforting, but Adolin couldn’t help but see it as a way to control the\nconversation. To put himself in the position of father, and Adolin squarely\ninto his role as whining child.\n“Son,” Dalinar said, “I believe in you. Go, succeed on this mission.\nConvince the honorspren that we’re worthy of them. Prove to them that we\nhave men waiting to take up the oaths and soar.”\nAdolin glanced at his father’s hand on his shoulder, then met the man’s\neyes. There was something in those words …\n“You want me to become one of them, don’t you?” Adolin said. “Part of\nthe purpose of this trip, in your eyes, is for me to become a Radiant!”\n“Your brother is worthy,” Dalinar said, “and your father—against his\nbest efforts—has proven worthy. I’m sure you will prove yourself too.”\nAs if I didn’t have enough burdens.\nComplaints died on Adolin’s lips—complaints that there were likely\nthousands of worthy people in the world and not all of them would be"

Complaints that he was fine with his life and didn’t need to live up\nto some spren’s ideals.\nInstead, Adolin simply bowed his head and nodded. Dalinar won the\nargument. The Blackthorn was unaccustomed to anything else. It wasn’t\nthat Adolin agreed, but more that he didn’t know what to think, and that was\nthe real problem. He couldn’t stand up to his father with maybes.\nDalinar clapped him on the shoulder with his other hand and wished him\nfarewell. Adolin walked Gallant into the chamber—highprince, leader of\nthe expedition, and somehow still a little boy.\nIt was crowded inside with the horses. These circular control buildings\nhad a rotating inner wall, along with murals on the floor indicating various\nlocations. Normally in order to initiate a swap, a Radiant used their\nShardblade as a key to rotate the inner wall to the proper point.\nToday, Shallan did something different. At a nod from him, she\nsummoned her Shardblade and fit it into the keyhole on the wall. Then she\nkept pushing, her sword melting out like a silvery puddle on the wall, the\nhilt flowing like liquid around her hand.\nShe lifted her hand upward, moving the entire locking mechanism\nstraight up. In a flash, they were thrown into Shadesmar.\nI have reached out to the others as you requested, and have received a\nvariety of responses.\nOver the last week, Adolin had tasked his soldiers with making the transfer\nto Shadesmar several times. He’d even sent the horses in and out to make\ncertain they wouldn’t panic. So most everyone was ready for what they saw.\nNevertheless, they all—Adolin included—fell silent, struck by the\nincredible sights.\nThe sky was black as midnight, only without stars. The sun seemed too\ndistant, too frail, to properly light the place, though he wasn’t in darkness.\nHe could easily see the small platform around them, which was the size of\nthe control room. The sunlight illuminated the landscape, but strangely\ndidn’t light the sky.\nThe control room hadn’t come with them. Instead, two enormous spren\nstood in the air nearby: the attendants of this gateway, thirty or forty feet\ntall, one marble white and the other onyx.\nAdolin raised a hand toward them as he stepped across the platform.\n“Thank you, Ancient Ones!” he called.\n“It is done as the Stormfather requires,” the marble one replied, voice\nbooming. “Our parent, the Sibling, has died. We will obey him instead.”\nLong ago, a mysterious spren named the Sibling had lived in Urithiru. It\nwas now dead. Or sleeping. Or maybe that was the same thing. Spren\nanswers about the Sibling contradicted one another. In any case, before\ndying, the Sibling had commanded these sentries to stop allowing people\ninto Shadesmar.\nMany of the gatekeepers maintained this rule.

They said that in the absence of other\nBondsmiths, Dalinar and the Stormfather were worthy of obedience—even\nin contradiction of ancient orders.\nThat was fortunate, for while Shallan could slip into Shadesmar using\nher powers, she couldn’t take anyone with her—and she couldn’t return on\nher own. Even Jasnah, whose powers supposedly allowed it, had trouble\nbringing herself back from Shadesmar.\nThis platform was one of ten set upon tall pillars here, rising in a pattern\nsimilar to the one the Oathgates made in front of Urithiru. Adolin could see\nthe other sentries hanging above them.\nEach pillar had a long spiraling ramp around it, leading down to the bead\nocean far below. But the tower itself was far more majestic than any other\nsight. Adolin turned around, gazing up at the shimmering mountain of light\nand colors. The mother-of-pearl radiance didn’t exactly mimic the shape of\nthe tower, but had a more crystalline feel to it. Except it wasn’t physical, but\nlight. Radiant, resplendent, and brilliant.\nThe tower was the same color the sky turned in Shadesmar when a\nhighstorm was passing over Roshar. And the place was positively swarming\nwith emotion spren on this side. They soared through it in great swarms,\ntaking a variety of shapes—most distant enough that Adolin saw them only\nas small bits of color, though he knew they had strange shapes here. More\norganic, more beastly. They flew, crawled, and climbed across and through\nthe tower’s shimmering light, making it look like a hive. It wasn’t until\ncoming here that Adolin had realized just how many spren the humans of\nUrithiru attracted.\nSome of those could be dangerous on this side, but they’d been told the\nnature of the tower offered protection from that. Spren here were glutted on\nemotions, and were calmer.\nEveryone took a few minutes to absorb the stunning vista—the mountain\nof iridescent colors, the sentinels, the spren, and the long drop to the ocean\nbelow. Adolin finally tore his eyes away to do a quick recount of their\nnumbers, as the Radiants had been joined by their personal spren.\nPattern stood near Shallan; he was a tall figure in too-stiff robes with a\nchanging symbol for a head. Adolin felt he could tell Pattern from the other\nCryptics. There was a spring to Pattern’s step; he bounced when the other\nthree Cryptics glided. Their symbols were also slightly … different.\nAdolin cocked his head, trying to decide why he should think that, as the\nsymbols were always changing, never repeating that he could see. Yet the\nspeed at which they changed, and the general feel of each one, was distinct.\nZu—the closest Radiant to Adolin—leaped up and grabbed her tall spren\nin a hug. “Ha!” said the golden-haired Stoneward. “You’re a mountain on\nthis side, Ua’pam!”\nHer spren’s skin appeared as if it were made of cracked rock, and it was\nglowing from within as if molten.

Ua’pam wore fur-lined clothing on this side, like one might expect\nfrom one who lived high in the mountains. Adolin wasn’t certain how all\nthat worked. Did spren get cold?\nGodeke was an Edgedancer, so his spren was a cultivationspren, a type\nAdolin had seen many times before: shaped roughly like a short woman,\nshe was composed entirely of vines. Those vines wound tightly together\ninto a face that had two crystals for eyes. Crystal hands, incredibly fine and\ndelicate, emerged from the sleeves of her robe, and she had an aloof air as\nshe looked around.\nThe last spren was the oddest to Adolin. She seemed to be made entirely\nfrom mist, all save for the face, which hovered on the front of the head in\nthe shape of a porcelain mask. That mask had a kind of twinkling reflection\nto it, always catching the light—in fact, he could have sworn that from\nsome perspectives it was made of translucent crystal. The spren seemed to\nbe female, or at least had a feminine figure and voice.\nThis would be the spren of Arshqqam, the Truthwatcher. The spren wore\na vest and trousers, both of which somehow floated and encapsulated the\nbody made entirely of white fog. Her hands ended in gloves. Was it mist\ninside there, moving her fingers?\n“Do you like staring at me, human?” she asked with a delicate voice that\ntinkled like cracking glass. The mask’s lips didn’t move when she spoke.\n“We mistspren can choose our forms, you know. We usually choose a shape\nlike a person, but we don’t need to. You seem so fascinated. Do you think\nme pretty, or do you think me a monster?”\n“I…” Adolin said.\n“Answer not,” Zu’s peakspren—Ua’pam—said with a grinding voice.\n“You. Tease not.”\n“I’m not teasing,” she replied. “Merely questioning. I like to know how\nminds think.”\n“A worthy enough goal,” Adolin said, searching around again. All of the\nRadiant spren were there, but where was she?\nShallan caught his eyes and nodded toward the ramp down, so he hurried\nover, stopping at the top as he found a final spren sitting there waiting. She\nwas another cultivationspren, with cordlike vines making up her face. But\nher vines were a dull brown and they pulled tighter—giving her features a\nsunken-in cast.\nMaya still wore the same dull brown rags. However, he saw hints of\nwhat they’d once been. Not robes as Godeke’s spren wore. This had been a\nuniform.\nHer most unnerving feature was her scratched-out eyes. It seemed as if\nsomeone had taken a knife to her face, except she hadn’t bled or been\nscarred by the cuts. She’d been erased. Ripped apart. Removed from\nexistence.

And, he hoped, his friend.\n“Mayalaran,” he said, holding out his hand toward her.\nShe regarded the hand, then cocked her head. As if it were some strange\nalien object for which she could determine no use. Adolin moved down the\nramp and lightly took her hand, then put it into his. The coiled cords of her\nskin had a firm, smooth texture. Like a good hogshide hilt.\n“Come on,” he said. “Let me introduce the others.”\nHe tugged on her hand and she followed, standing up and wordlessly\njoining him on the top of the platform.\n“That’s Shallan,” Adolin said, pointing. “My wife. You remember her\nand Pattern, right? There’s Godeke—he was once an ardent. Arshqqam is\nour Truthwatcher; she used to take care of orphans. And Zu, she’s…”\nAdolin hesitated. “Zu, what did you used to do?”\n“Make trouble, mostly,” the Iriali woman said. She pulled off her thick\ncoat, letting out a deep sigh. Underneath she wore a tight wrap around her\nupper torso, a little like a warrior’s sarashi. She had bronze skin that seemed\nmetallic to Adolin, and her hair wasn’t like his own blond—it was too\ngolden. Though his mother had been from Rira, near Iri, the two peoples\nwere distinct.\n“Come on, Ua’pam!” she said. “Let’s see what’s at the bottom of this\nramp!”\n“Be careful,” the peakspren said as Zu put her coat over her shoulder and\nstrolled to the side of the ramp.\n“Well,” Adolin said to Maya, “that’s Zu. Those other six are Shallan’s\nLightweavers and their spren. Here, meet my soldiers.…”\nAs he pulled Maya over to introduce her to Felt, the mistspren walked\nover beside him. “There is no use talking to a deadeye,” the creature said\nwith unmoving lips. “Do you not understand this? What about you makes\nyou wish to talk to something that cannot understand you?”\n“She understands,” Adolin said.\n“You think that she does. This is curious.”\nAdolin ignored the odd spren, instead introducing Maya to his team.\nHe’d told them to expect her, so they each bowed respectfully and didn’t\nstare at her strange eyes too much. Ledder even complimented her\nappearance as a Blade, saying he’d always admired her beauty.\nMaya took it all with her characteristic mute solemnity. She didn’t cock\nher head; she simply stood by Adolin, looking at whoever was speaking.\nShe did understand. He’d felt her emotions through the sword; in fact, he\nfelt like he’d always been able to sense her encouraging him.\nShallan came over and took him by the arm. “We should be moving on,”\nshe said. “See if the ship has arrived.”\n“Right, right,” he said. “Here, watch Maya a moment. I need to check on\nGallant.”\nHe hurried over to the horse, and by the time he arrived he already knew"

Humans in the Physical Realm were represented\nhere as lights like floating candle flames. A group of them gathered near the\nhorse and were interacting with some shimmering, glowing blue colors.\nTo be certain, Adolin checked Gallant’s armor trunks. The Shardplate\nhadn’t made the trip. Adolin had hoped … well, it meant his armor wasn’t\ndifferent from any of the others. It couldn’t be brought into Shadesmar. The\nlights on the other side were his armorers collecting the Plate, which would\nhave dropped to the platform on the other side.\n“Ah well,” he said, unhooking the now-empty armor trunks. “Let’s get\nthese off you.”\nGallant blew out in a way that Adolin chose to interpret as sympathetic.\nAdolin redistributed the weight, then checked the weapons in Gallant’s\nsheaths—including the massive greatsword that had almost the bulk of a\nShardblade.\nThey started walking toward the ramp, but Adolin paused, cocking his\nhead. When Gallant moved, he trailed a faint shadow of light. It was almost\nimperceptible. When the horse shook his head from side to side, there was a\ndistinct impression of an afterimage the shape of the head, but glowing.\n“Didn’t expect you to be different here,” Adolin said to the horse.\nGallant blew out again. His version of a shrug. Then he nibbled at\nAdolin’s coat pocket.\nAdolin chuckled and dug out the other fruit he’d hidden there—wrapped\nin a handkerchief, naturally. Wouldn’t do to stain his coat. He gave it to the\nhorse with a pat on the neck. “Well, at least you won’t need to haul that\nPlate around.”\nIt made Adolin feel exposed. No Blade, no Plate, and the Radiants would\nbe limited—for while they brought plenty of infused gemstones, they\ncouldn’t renew them.\nHe called for the group to begin carefully making its way down the\nramp. With the railing, it wasn’t too dangerous—but the walk was a long\none. Urithiru was high in the mountains, and they needed to hike down to\nsea level. Strangely, Shallan told him they’d done measurements, and the\npath wasn’t nearly as long as it would be in the Physical Realm. Space\nwasn’t a one-to-one correlation in Shadesmar. Things seemed more\ncompressed here, specifically in the vertical dimension. Isasik the\nmapmaker thought the place was incredible for reasons Adolin hadn’t been\nable to grasp, despite having it explained to him three times.\nAt any rate, the hike would take several hours. They started out, and\nShallan joined him, watching Maya walk with Gallant ahead.\nAdolin put his arm around his wife. “Do you think she was happy to see\nme? I hope she enjoys being around us. It has to be better than simply\nwalking around on this side, haunting wherever I happen to be going.”\n“I’m sure she’s happy,” Shallan said.\n“You don’t … think I’m crazy, do you? To treat her as I do?”\n“I find it endearing,” Shallan said."

To treat her as I do?”\n“I find it endearing,” Shallan said.\n“Even if you tease me about it?”\n“That’s how you know.” She smiled and stopped him, then went up on\nher tiptoes to kiss him. “I like the outfit too. You chose well.”\n“Thanks, I…” Adolin trailed off as someone else put their arm around\nhim, then around Shallan. Adolin twisted his head to find Pattern standing\nbehind them, giving both of them a hug. His clothing was stiff, like it was\nmade out of glass, and his collar pressed uncomfortably against Adolin’s\near.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “I like having arms. If Maya does not speak, and\nyou want to hear someone speak, I am very good at talking. I can say words\nabout many kinds of things.”\n“Um, thanks?” Adolin said.\n“You are welcome. Should we not walk? On our feet? The ones I now\nhave again? I do like my feet. They are befittingly perambulatory.” He held\nup his leg, and showed bare feet beneath his robe. Curious. Adolin had\nalways assumed they didn’t have feet. Pattern moved off, humming\ndelightedly to himself.\n* * *\nAn hour later, Adolin could still see Urithiru shimmering above. A bonfire\nof colors and light, though oddly it didn’t cast shadows. Many sources of\nlight in Shadesmar didn’t. And those that did sometimes cast them in the\nwrong direction.\nThey ate field rations, continuing steadily downward in a spiral around\nthe enormous pillar. Eventually he was able to pick out the ocean below. In\nShadesmar, land and sea were reversed—so here, the continent was\nmanifest as a vast ocean of beads. They’d find ground where rivers ran after\nhighstorms or at the edges of the continent, where the oceans began in the\nreal world.\nAll things in Roshar manifested in Shadesmar. Most objects became\nbeads, while living people and animals became little flames of light like the\nones he’d seen above. They passed some of those as they walked, hovering\noff in the distance. Adolin assumed those were the guards who watched\nover the complex of tunnels and caverns beneath Urithiru. Indeed, there\nwere more lights than he’d expected; Aunt Navani must have gotten her\nwish to have the caverns better guarded.\nEventually those vanished above, and he was left with only the endless\nview of the ocean. It bent his mind to think about those beads. The souls of\nall the objects that made up the physical world. Churning and mixing\ntogether, forming waves and surging tides, each composed of small beads\nno wider than his index finger.\nHe passed the time trying to get to know the members of his team. Zu\nliked to run off ahead, her spren often advising caution—and as often\nignored. Zu had worked as a guide in the Reshi Isles for years, after fleeing\nthere to find a place where people wouldn’t, as she put it, “keep making\nrules about how I should live.” She’d been glad to come on the mission and\nget away from the tower, which she considered stuffy.\nShe admitted to some brief combat experience.

        "text": "rules about how I should live.” She’d been glad to come on the mission and\nget away from the tower, which she considered stuffy.\nShe admitted to some brief combat experience. Her spren didn’t speak\nmuch, and often in short sentences when he did, but Adolin liked the\ndefensive implications of having a spren that was literally made of stone.\nAs she ran off again to scout ahead, Adolin fell into line beside Godeke.\nThe Edgedancer kept staring at the sky, grinning like a child with a new\nsword. “The works of the Almighty are wondrous,” he said. “To think, this\nbeauty was always here with us. Look, are those a new kind of spren?”\nHe pointed at some that drifted by in the air—they resembled chickens,\nwith flapping wings and bulbous bodies.\n“I think those are gloryspren,” Adolin said. “Emotion spren are like this\nworld’s animals. They get pulled through to our side when they sense some\nkind of strong emotion, and we see them in distorted ways.”\n“Amazing,” Godeke said. “Thank you for bringing me on this trip,\nBrightlord. Archinal has told me of this place at length, but I never thought\nI’d experience it. I will burn prayers of thanks tonight … if we have a fire,\nthat is. I’m still not sure how all this works!”\n“You … continue to follow the Almighty then?” Adolin asked.\n“Vorinism and all that? Despite finding out that the Heralds betrayed us?”\n“The Heralds are not God, but His servants,” Godeke said. “Storms\nknow, I’ve failed Him more than once myself.” He adopted a distant\nexpression. “I don’t think we can blame them for eventually wearing out.\nRather, I think about how remarkable it is that they worked for so long to\nkeep us safe.”\n“And the fact that they confirmed the death of the Almighty?”\n“The death of Honor,” Godeke said. “One aspect of the Almighty.” He\nsmiled. “It’s all right, Brightlord. I can understand someone questioning\nnow, of all times. Remember though, the church taught that we are all\naspects of the Almighty—that He lives in us. As He lived in the being called\nHonor, who was tasked with protecting men.\n“The Almighty cannot die. People can die. Heralds can die. Even Honor\ncould die. But Honor, people, and Heralds will all live again—transformed,\nSoulcast through His power.” Godeke glanced back at his packhorse, which\nhis spren was riding. Stuffed into the saddlebags and peeking out were\nseveral books. “I’m still learning. We all are. The Book of Endless Pages\ncannot be filled … though your father made a very nice addition to the\ntext.”\n“You’re okay with a man writing then?” Adolin said, frowning.\n“Your father is not simply a man, Adolin,” Godeke said.\n“He—”\n“Your father is a holy man. As I was, before taking up this new role.”\nGodeke shook his head. “All my life I lived with a deformity—and then in\nan instant I was transformed and healed. I became what I’d always seen\nmyself as being. Your father has undergone a more vibrant transformation."

Your father has undergone a more vibrant transformation.\nHe is as divine as any ardent.\n“And … I must admit some of what he says makes sense. How can it be\nforbidden for a person to see the holy words of the Almighty, solely because\nthat person is male? Makes me wonder whether we’ve misinterpreted all\nalong. Whether we’ve been selfish, wanting to keep all this for ourselves.\n“I don’t accept the conclusions your father came to—but I’m glad people\nare talking about the church rather than merely going about their lives,\nassuming the ardents will take care of everything. Many people only\nthought of religion when it was time for one of their Elevations.” He\ngrinned as another group of gloryspren sailed past. “I cannot wait to write\nof this to the others of my devotary. When they hear what wonders the\nAlmighty has created here…”\nAdolin wasn’t certain it all made sense as Godeke explained, but at the\nsame time it was nice to hear someone being so positive. He left Godeke to\nhis excitement, and went to chat with Arshqqam, translated by her spren.\nShe felt much as he had on his first time in Shadesmar. Overwhelmed.\n“I used to think my life made sense,” the woman said through the spren.\n“I used to think I knew how it would end. I didn’t want to leave Tashikk.\nThere my life was hard, but it was clear.”\n“Why did you leave, then?”\nShe studied him with a piercing gaze, unwavering. “How could I stay? I\nstill don’t know why I was chosen. A woman at the end of her life? But if a\nchild could answer the call, then I certainly could find no excuse.”\nThe child she referenced was Lift—who had recruited this woman, along\nwith several others, over the past year. The teen seemed to have a knack for\nlocating others who were manifesting powers.\n“What do you think of her?” Adolin asked. “Lift? She acts strange\nsometimes, even for a Radiant.”\nArshqqam grimaced, lips drawn to a distasteful line. “She is what I\nneeded, though I knew it not. And I would not have you tell her of my\nfondness for her, please. She needs a firm hand.”\nThat was fondness?\n“Stump,” Arshqqam said through her spren, seeming wistful. “That is\nwhat the children called me. A nickname. The only other person who ever\ngave me a term of endearment was my father. The children see me as a\nperson, when so many others have trouble. So the Stump I am. A glorious\ntitle, to come from children.”\nWhat an odd woman. But there was a calm solidity to her, and Adolin\nwas glad to have her along. Once the conversation fell off, Adolin moved to\nwalk with Shallan. They again went over the plans that Jasnah had drawn\nup for them. Working with the support of the collected monarchs, she’d left\nAdolin what seemed like an entire book’s worth of instructions. Fortunately,\nhe felt he could execute them. He might not be able to grasp why the shape\nof Shadesmar was so fascinating to a mapmaker, but acting as a dignitary"

He’d been trained for this role since his youth.\nThe basic plan was to present the honorspren with gifts along with\nwritten requests to begin relations. Nothing too pushy. An essay written by\nJasnah, another written by Dalinar with Queen Fen’s advisement, and a\nthird from the Azish imperial court. Adolin was to request admittance to the\nhonorspren fortress, stay a few days to get them used to the idea of talking\nto humans, then leave with a promise that they’d speak more in the future.\nSome of the Windrunner spren thought this would be enough, but Syl—\nin a rare appearance when Kaladin wasn’t around—had come to him the\nday before.\n“I worry that this isn’t going to work, Adolin,” she’d said. “I don’t think\nthey’ll even let you in. They aren’t like honorspren used to be. They’re\nafraid and they’re angry. I’m glad you want to try, but … be prepared for\ndisappointment. And don’t let them try to blame you for what Radiants did\nbefore.”\nUa’pam spotted the ship first. He waved to Adolin, then pointed over the\nside of the railing toward the rolling beads that were now only a hundred or\nso feet below. There, docked at the small patch of ground at the base of the\npillar, was a flat ship. A barge. The front portion had a small raised deck,\nfrom which to steer its flying mandras.\nThere was no sign of cabins or a hold—far less luxurious than the\nvessels they’d taken the last time. Of course, he wouldn’t care to repeat\nmuch about that particular experience. He’d gladly take a barge if it meant a\npeaceful voyage instead.\n“My cousin,” Ua’pam said, pointing to a figure on the barge waving a\nlight. “Like him!”\n“I’ll try.”\n“You will!” Ua’pam said.\n“Another peakspren?” Adolin asked, squinting.\n“Yes!”\n“We saw some of those on our last trip,” Adolin said. “They left us\nstranded at Celebrant.”\n“Kasiden peakspren, from the east? They are fools! Forget them.”\n“You have … different nationalities?”\n“Obviously! Silly man. You will learn.” The creature clapped Adolin on\nthe back with a firm strength. Though his stone hand was warm to the\ntouch, it wasn’t hot like Adolin might have expected from the glowing light\ncoming from the cracks.\nThey made the last few rotations around the column before—at long last\n—arriving at sea level. There was a little stone building built up against the\npillar underneath the ramp here, though scouts sent into Shadesmar had\nreported it empty.\nAdolin sent two men to search it anyway, then walked forward to meet\nUa’pam’s cousin. He was bald, like other peakspren Adolin had met—\nthough they tended to have more cracks on the head than on other parts of\nthe body. He wore a hat not unlike the one Veil favored. He replaced that\nafter bowing to them."

He replaced that\nafter bowing to them.\n“Welcome, human prince!” he said with an affable voice. “You will\npresent payment!”\nAdolin held up a small bag of glowing spheres. “How long do you think\nit will take to get to the southern bank?”\n“Two weeks, perhaps,” he said, waving for Adolin’s men to lead the\nhorses onto the long barge, which was around forty feet wide and a hundred\nfeet long. A few other peakspren worked on board, moving boxes to make\nroom for the newcomers. “Easy sailing lately. Few ships. You will be happy\nand relaxed!”\n“Few ships?”\n“Fused to the east,” the peakspren captain said, pointing. “Strange things\nin Shinovar. Honorspren acting uppity. Nobody wants to travel.”\nThey’d tried to find a spren captain who would sail them straight to\nLasting Integrity, the honorspren stronghold. Unfortunately, their options\nwere limited—and all the spren they’d spoken to refused. They said that the\nhonorspren didn’t like ships to sail too close.\nMost agreed that the safest path for Adolin’s group was to sail almost\ndirectly south until they hit land. From there, they could caravan southwest\n—along the Tukari coastline in the real world—until they reached Lasting\nIntegrity.\nAdolin walked Gallant aboard, then set to unhooking the animal’s\nburdens. It wasn’t long before everyone was settled and looking happy to be\ndone with the hike. He’d thought that going downhill the entire way would\nmake it easy, but his calves ached and his knees hurt from the unnatural\nmotion of stepping constantly on a slope.\nHe’d noticed some of the Radiants using Stormlight to keep their energy\nup, but he hadn’t complained. Though their Stormlight resources couldn’t\nbe renewed, the smaller spheres would start running out even before the\nocean trip was over. The real reserves—the ones they needed to preserve—\nwere all larger gemstones that would keep their Light much longer.\nUa’pam joined his cousin in unhooking the ropes from the dock and\nhelping the crew prepare the barge for sailing. This included harnessing up\nfour very large mandras—long flying spren with several sets of filmy,\nundulating wings—that had been hovering about lazily on leashes.\nAs soon as the mandras were hooked to the vessel, it rose a little higher\nin the beads. With that they were off—Adolin’s soldiers making camp on\nthe barge deck, where they began arranging boxes to form walls and using\ntarps to make a kind of shelter. The barge didn’t move quickly, but there\nwas a relaxing rhythm to the way it rolled over the beads. The previous\nships had cut through them with great crashes. Here the sound of the beads\nwas more peaceful, a quiet clicking.\nAdolin helped Shallan settle her things, including several trunks full of\nsupplies—and she gracefully refrained from joking about how many more\ntrunks Adolin had brought than her. It didn’t seem the boat would be\nmoving quickly enough to require them to lash things down, so once her\ntrunks were piled, he brushed his hands off—then paused, noticing his wife."

That’s\ngoing to be a mess to clean.” She shut the lid with a sigh, shaking her head\nas he offered to help. “No, I can do it.”\nWell, Adolin didn’t want to rest while his men were working. So he\nwalked over to Gallant, who deserved a brushing after carting Adolin’s\nthings down that ramp.\nHe set to work, enjoying the familiar motions of the grooming. Gallant\nkept glancing at Adolin’s luggage, where he’d hidden some fruit.\n“Not yet,” Adolin said.\nThe horse blew out in annoyance, then looked at Adolin’s brush.\n“Yes,” Adolin replied. “I brought all three. You think I’d bring seven\ndifferent swords but forget your brushes?”\nThe horse made a kind of clicking sound with his mouth, something\nSureblood had never done. Adolin wasn’t certain how to interpret it. Mirth?\n“I’ll give you the fruit,” Adolin promised, continuing to brush, “but only\nafter…”\nHe trailed off as he noticed Maya standing nearby. He’d settled her near\nthe others earlier, but she’d apparently decided not to stay there.\nAdolin continued brushing. She watched for a time. Then she tentatively\nheld out her palm. Adolin handed her the brush and she stared at it. She\nseemed so baffled that he figured he must have misunderstood what she\nwanted.\nThen she started brushing the horse as he had. From the top down the\nside, with the same exact motion Adolin had used.\nAdolin chuckled. “You have to brush more than one section, Maya, or\nhe’ll get annoyed.”\nHe showed her, brushing along Gallant’s flank in the direction of the hair\ngrowth. Long, slow, careful strokes. She soon got the hang of it, and Adolin\nstepped back to get a drink. He found two of the peakspren sailors watching\nhim.\n“Your deadeye,” one said, scratching at his stone head with a sound of\nrock on rock. “I’ve never seen one trained so well.”\n“She’s not trained,” Adolin said. “She wanted to help, so I showed her\nhow.”\nOne sailor looked to the other, then shook his head. They said something\nin a language Adolin didn’t understand, but they seemed unnerved by\nMaya, giving her a wide berth as they continued about their duties.\nAdolin sipped from his canteen, watching as the pillar retreated. He\ncould barely make out the glow of the tower city far above, dwindling as\nthey moved.\nI’ll do my part, Father, Adolin thought. I’ll give them your letters, but\nI’ll do more. I’ll find a way to persuade them to help us.

She tried not to panic. She failed. So she settled for\nseeming like she wasn’t panicking.\nWhile packing her things, she’d taken a Memory of Mraize’s\ncommunication cube, packed away in her trunk. With her uncanny abilities,\nshe could picture it precisely where she’d placed it. She’d wanted to be\nextra careful, but she hadn’t thought the Memory would be relevant so\nquickly.\nBecause the cube had been moved.

An\nimperceptible difference; someone without her abilities would never have\nnoticed.\nSomeone had moved the cube. Somehow, between packing and arriving\non the barge, someone had rifled through her things and used the cube.\nShe could come to only one conclusion. The spy was indeed on this\nmission—and they were using this very device to report to Mraize.\nMuch as you indicate, there is a division among the other Shards I\nwould not have anticipated.\nKaladin pulled the bandage snug on the boy’s ankle. “Next time, Adin,” he\nsaid, “take the steps one at a time.”\nThe youth nodded solemnly. He was perhaps twelve or thirteen. “One at\na time. Until I get my spren.”\n“Oh? Your spren?”\n“I’m gonna be a Windrunner,” the boy said. “Then I’ll float down steps.”\n“That’s what it means to be a Radiant, is it?” Kaladin asked, standing.\n“Floating.”\n“That, and you can stick your friends to the walls if they argue with\nyou,” he said. “A Windrunner told me.”\n“Let me guess. Short fellow. Herdazian. Big smile?”\n“Yup.”\n“Well, until then,” Kaladin said, “I need you to keep your weight off that\nfoot.” He looked to the father, standing nearby, his trousers marked with\npotter’s crem. “That means a crutch if he has to walk somewhere. Come\nback and see me in a week; his progress will let us know for certain it didn’t\nfracture.”\nThe father helped his son with a thankful murmur. As they left, Kaladin\ndutifully washed his hands in the exam room’s basin. He’d picked up his\nfather’s mannerisms in that regard. Wisdom of the Heralds, it was said.\nHe’d met some of those Heralds now, and they didn’t seem so wise to him,\nbut whatever.\nIt felt strange to be wearing a white surgeon’s apron.

Something\nthat helps, but doesn’t wring me out like an old washrag.”\nNear the end of his time as a Windrunner, he’d found even simple\nsparring to be emotionally taxing. Daily activities, like assigning duties, had\nrequired so much effort that they’d left him with a pounding headache. He\ncouldn’t explain why.\nThis work—rememorizing medical texts, seeing patients, dealing with\ndifficult parents or lighteyes—should have been worse. It wasn’t. Busy, but\nnot overwhelmed, Kaladin never saw anyone who was hurt too badly—\nthose went for Regrowth. So while there was tension to his work, there\nwasn’t immediacy.\nWas he happy?\nHe wasn’t sad.\nFor now, he’d accept “not sad.”\nHawin led in the next patient, then excused herself to run to the privy.\nThis patient was an older man with a patchwork beard and a friendly face.\nKaladin recognized him; Mil never had been able to grow that beard out\nlike he wanted. While the clinic drew mostly from the people who had lived\nin Hearthstone, his little town had sprouted significantly in the last few\nyears. Most of the refugees hadn’t been Herdazian, but Alethi from villages\ncloser to the border. So while Kaladin felt he should know all of his\npatients, many were strangers.\nIt was good to see Mil again. He’d always been less mean to Kaladin’s\nfamily than some others. The old man was complaining of persistent\nheadaches. And indeed, the same painspren from earlier in the day wiggled\nback up from the floor. After ruling out the easy causes—dehydration, lack\nof sleep—Kaladin had him describe where the pain generally originated\nfrom, and whether the headaches affected his vision.\n“Hawin,” Kaladin said, “read me the list of migraine prodromes please.\nYou’ll find them at the divider between head and neck…” He trailed off,\nremembering his reader had left.\nA moment later though, a different voice said, “Um, prodromes.\nRight … Uh, just a sec.”\nHe looked toward the reading desk to find Syl laboriously lifting pages\nand flipping them over. She didn’t have much strength in the Physical\nRealm, but ignoring gravity—walking up into the air to tow the page by its\ncorner—helped, and the book wasn’t far from the appropriate page.\nShe found it and landed on the large tome, kneeling to read the words\none at a time. “Neck stiffness,” she said. “Um … conster … cons—”\n“Constipation,” Kaladin said.\nShe giggled, then kept reading. “Mood changes, cravings, thirst, um, I"

Stuff goes out of you, and it’s\nbad. Stuff doesn’t go out of you and it’s bad. How do you live like this?”\nHe ignored that, chatting with Mil about his pains. He suggested visiting\nthe Edgedancers for Regrowth—but Mil’s pains had been around for\nmonths, so it was unlikely that they could do anything.\nFortunately, there were medicines that could help, and—with Jasnah\ncapable of Soulcasting a wide range of substances—they had access to rare\nmedications. Though Kaladin and the queen didn’t often see eye to eye, it\nsaid a great deal about her that she was willing to take time to make\nmedicine.\nKaladin gave Mil a requisition chit to get some from the medical\nquartermaster, and told him to spend a month recording each and every\nheadache, with signs he’d noticed of it coming on. It wasn’t much, but Mil\ngrinned ear to ear. Often people just wanted to know they weren’t fools or\nweaklings for coming in. They wanted to know their pains were real, and\nthat there was something—even something small—they could do about the\nproblem. Simple affirmation could be worth more than medication.\nHe waved farewell to Mil, grateful that—despite several lifetimes’ worth\nof tragedy squeezed into the years between then and now—much of his\nsurgeon’s training remained. He walked over to Syl, who had settled down\nwith her legs over the side of the book. Today she was wearing something\nakin to what his mother often wore: an unassuming skirt and a buttoned\nblouse, faintly Thaylen in style.\n“So,” he said, “when did you learn to read?”\n“Last week.”\n“You learned to read in a week.”\n“It’s not as hard as it seemed at first. I figured you’d need someone to\nread for you, as a surgeon. I think I might be able to become surgery tools\ntoo. I mean, not a scalpel since, you know, I don’t actually cut flesh. But\nyour father was using a little hammer the other day…”\n“For testing reflexes,” Kaladin said. “It’s best with a cloth wrap on the\nfront, or rubber. Can you become things other than metal? I’d love to not\nhave to share the stethoscope with Father.” Another expensive tool that\nTaravangian’s surgeons had provided for them upon request.\n“I don’t know,” she said. “I feel like … I feel like there is a lot to explore\nwith our powers, Kaladin. Things that in the past maybe they didn’t have\nthe time or resources to think about. Because they were always fighting.”\nHe nodded, thoughtful. Syl got a far-off look in her eyes, and when she\nnoticed him watching, she plastered a smile on her face. That struck him as\nfake; she seemed to be trying a little too hard today. Or maybe he was\nprojecting.\nHe stretched, then stepped out and peeked into the waiting room. Only a\nhandful of people remained today. So Kaladin had time for a short break.\nHe walked along the hallway into the family room, which had a door out\nonto the communal balcony. As he’d hoped when they’d come here, that"

As he’d hoped when they’d come here, that\nwide balcony now served as a general-purpose meeting place for the people\nof Hearthstone, like a town square. Laundry flapped on lines to one side.\nChildren ran and played. People sat and chatted.\nKaladin trailed out to the edge of the balcony. Below he could see\nDalinar’s armies gathering for the trip to Azir. He forced himself to look\nand to acknowledge he wasn’t going with them.\nA figure in blue streaked by, soaring through the air. Leyten must have\nseen Kaladin, because a short time later a larger group of Windrunners\nhovered up near the balcony. Most everyone stopped their activities,\nchildren running to the balcony’s edge.\nAs one, the Windrunners saluted. The Bridge Four salute; though most\nhad never been in Bridge Four and didn’t use the salute to one another, they\nalways gave it to him and other members of the original Windrunners.\nHe returned the Bridge Four salute to them all, tapping his wrists\ntogether.\nThe fifty-odd Windrunners turned and streaked back down. Below, light\nflashed in a circle around the Oathgate, making an entire battalion of troops\nvanish. They’d learned that how much Stormlight was expended for a\ntransfer depended on the Radiant operating the device—the more\nexperienced the Radiant, the less Stormlight required. Jasnah was probably\noperating today; she could do things with her powers that were well beyond\nthe rest of them. Though she didn’t show it off, she’d plainly sworn the\nFourth Ideal. The one Kaladin would never reach.\n“They’re all going away,” Syl said softly, landing on his shoulder.\n“Not all of them,” Kaladin said. “Around twenty will stay to guard the\ntower.”\n“But none of our friends.”\nIt was true. All the former members of Bridge Four were going with\nDalinar. Maybe Rlain would stay behind, and work on the fields? Though\nhe often chose to go with the Windrunner support staff, to help out there,\nwith Dabbid and a few squire hopefuls.\nWatching them all fly off, it was impossible not to feel so very alone.\nRemember the peace you have felt this last week, Kaladin thought. Don’t\nbe sorry for yourself. Be excited for the new path forward you’re making.\nThe thoughts didn’t work; it still hurt to see them all leave. Hurt to know\nShallan and Adolin had gone off to Shadesmar without him. He had his\nparents and his new brother, and he appreciated that. But the men and\nwomen of Bridge Four had become equally important to him.\nThat part of his life was over. Best not to dwell on it. Kaladin returned to\nthe exam room. Hawin was waiting, so he sent her for the next patient.\nHe settled into a rhythm, seeing patients, occasionally sticking his head\ninto the next exam room to ask his father for advice on a diagnosis or\nremedy. He dealt with an unusual number of coughs. Apparently there was\nsomething moving through the tower—a sickness that left people with\nmucus in their lungs and an overall feeling of aches.

His father had been tracking it though, and\nsaid that Kharbranthian surgeons reported it wasn’t deadly. A plague from\nthe West that, when all was said and done, didn’t live up to its reputation.\nThe sickness barely attracted any plaguespren—though there didn’t seem to\nbe many around the tower to attract, so that would be part of it.\nHe recommended lots of rest, fluids, and handwashing. The day\nstretched long, and the patients slowed to a trickle. One woman stood out to\nhim. She was a refugee, and while getting treated for her coughs, she asked\nif Kaladin had seen her uncle. She’d heard of someone matching his\ndescription arriving in Hearthstone immediately before the evacuation.\nKaladin had her wait and went looking for his father. Lirin’s exam room\nwas empty, but Hesina’s voice rose from the waiting room, so Kaladin\nwalked out to ask her about the refugee’s uncle.\nRight before he arrived, Kaladin heard a familiar voice that made him\nfreeze in place.\n“—always been like this,” the gruff voice said. “Been clean for … what,\nsix months now? Storm me. Six months. That’s something. Can’t stand the\nbattle though, not any longer. It’s gotten inside me, see. Itches at my brain.”\nKaladin burst into the waiting room to find Teft chatting with his mother.\nThe older man was out of uniform, wearing common trousers and shirt, his\ngrey beard trimmed. Not as short as an ardent’s beard, but not distinctively\nlong either. There was no sign of his spren, Phendorana, though she\ngenerally preferred to hide from sight.\n“Teft?” Kaladin said. “You were mobilized. Why aren’t you with\neveryone else?”\n“Can’t go,” Teft said. “Too much wrong with my brain. Went and spoke\nto the Blackthorn, and he said it would be a good idea for me to step down.”\n“You … Teft, you’re doing better. You have no reason to step down from\nduty.”\nTeft shrugged. “Felt like it was time. Got a bit of a cough too. And an\nache in my knee, even when there aren’t storms. War’s for young kids, not\nold dried-up pieces of bark.”\nHesina cocked her head, seeming confused—but Syl landed on Kaladin’s\nshoulder and gasped at seeing Teft, then clapped excitedly.\n“Rock is gone,” Teft said, “and Moash … Moash is worse than gone.\nSigzil needs to lead the rest of them, without me being baggage to bother\nhim. You and I were the start of this though. Figure we ought to stick\ntogether.”\n“Teft,” Kaladin said softer, stepping forward. “You can’t follow me\nhere.”\nTeft lifted his chin, defiant.\n“I order you to go back to duty,” Kaladin said.\n“Oh?

Not right in the head. Nobody can argue that ain’t so.”\nKaladin looked to his mother, feeling helpless.\nShe shrugged. “You shouldn’t force someone into war, Kaladin. Not\nunless you want to be like Amaram.”\n“You’re taking Teft’s side?” Kaladin asked.\n“Lad,” Teft said softly, “you ain’t the only one with a mind full of\nhorrors. You ain’t the only one whose hands shake now and then, thinking\nof it all. I need a rest too. That’s Kelek’s own truth.”\nHe was exaggerating. Kaladin knew he was. The man—while prone to\naddictive and self-destructive behavior—was not battle shocked. That\nwasn’t something you could easily prove, however. Especially when the\nman in question was as obstinate as Teft.\nTeft unfolded his arms, then folded them again, as if to make the gesture\nmore firmly. His clothing was neat and clean, but there was always\nsomething a little frayed about Teft. You got the sense that the uniform\nnever quite fit him, as if Teft was half a size between standard\nmeasurements.\nThat said, he was—to his core—a military man. If there was one thing a\ngood sergeant knew, it was to never let your officer go into an unknown\nsituation alone. Who knew what trouble a lighteyes would get into without\nhis common sense tagging along? Teft took ideas like that to heart. And\nKaladin knew, meeting Teft’s eyes, that the man was never going to budge.\n“Fine,” Kaladin said.\nTeft leaped to his feet, gave Kaladin’s mother a little salute, then fell into\nstep behind Kaladin as they walked toward the exam room.\n“So, what are we doing?” Teft asked.\n“You said you wanted a diagnosis,” Kaladin said, stopping outside the\ndoor.\n“Nah. Know I’m crazy already. You going to poke at me until I snap?\nSkip that part. What are we doing today? Binding wounds?”\nKaladin gave him a level stare. Teft just stared back, stubborn as a storm.\nWell, Kaladin had trained them all as surgeon’s assistants, with knowledge\nof basic field medicine. He could do worse than Teft as an aide.\nIt didn’t seem like he had a choice either way. That should have\nfrustrated him. Instead he found himself feeling warm. They weren’t all\ngone.\n“Thank you, Teft,” he whispered. “You shouldn’t have given up so\nmuch. But … thank you.”\nTeft nodded.\n“There is a refugee woman here looking for her uncle,” Kaladin said.\n“Shall we see if we can track him down for her?”\nEndowment at least responded to my overtures, though I have not been\nable to locate Invention again following our initial contact.\nRadiant did not want to be in control at the moment.\nAs the second day of their voyage dawned—or, well, occurred, since the\nsun didn’t move in Shadesmar—Shallan retreated entirely.

Unfortunately, after\nVeil’s stunt in seizing control a few days back—violating the compact—\nneither wanted her to be in charge.\nSo it rested on Radiant to rise, do her exercises, and then try to figure out\nsomething to do with her day. Adolin’s soldiers busied themselves tidying\nthe camp space on the barge, then doing the multitude of other things—like\nsharpening weapons or oiling armor—that military men used to pass the\ntime. Zu was chatting with the other peakspren, Arshqqam was reading, and\nAdolin was caring for his swords.\nRadiant set Beryl and Ishnah to recording observations about Shadesmar,\nand assigned Vathah to see if the peakspren sailors needed any help.\nAnd what to do with herself? Find the spy, Shallan whispered deep\ninside. We need to find out which one is the spy.\nI am ill-equipped for espionage, Radiant thought. She walked the\nperimeter of the deck, observing the Radiant spren. Four different varieties,\neach unique. Perhaps you can do drawings for now, until we decide to let\nVeil finish her punishment. Finding the spy isn’t something we need to do\nimmediately, after all.\nBut Shallan didn’t emerge. Sometimes this was how it was; they couldn’t\nalways choose which of them would be in control. But Shallan’s growing\ntension … that was worrisome.\nYou’re still troubled by how Veil violated our compact, aren’t you?\nRadiant asked.\nWe’re supposed to be getting better, not worse, Shallan thought.\nEveryone makes mistakes. Everyone slips.\nNot you, Shallan thought. You have never seized control like that.\nRadiant felt an immediate stab of guilt. But there was nothing to be done\nabout that; best to move forward. Radiant took a seat on the deck near the\nrailing, then flipped through Ialai’s book as she listened to the churning\nbeads.\nTogether, the Three had figured out most everything in the book. The\nplace names were locations beyond the various expanses in Shadesmar—\nworlds beyond the edge of the map. Pattern had confirmed this by chatting\nwith a few other spren who had met travelers from these places.\nAnother section of the book contained Ialai’s conjectures and\ninformation about the leader of the Ghostbloods, the mysterious Thaidakar.\nWhoever this was, Radiant thought—from the context of what was written\n—that he must be someone from one of those far-off worlds.\nThere was a final clue in the book, one that Radiant found most curious.\nIalai had discovered that the Ghostbloods were obsessed with a specific\nspren named Ba-Ado-Mishram. That was a name from myth, one of the\nUnmade. It had been this spren who had taken over for Odium following\nthe Final Desolation; she had granted the singers forms of power.\nBy capturing Ba-Ado-Mishram—locking her in a gemstone—\nhumankind had stolen the minds of the singers in ancient times.

By cross-referencing those with musings in\nIalai’s book, Radiant began to get a picture of what had happened so many\ncenturies ago.\nShe was increasingly certain Mraize was hunting the gemstone that held\nBa-Ado-Mishram. He’d likely thought he would find it at Urithiru; but if it\nhad been there, then the Midnight Mother—who had controlled the place\nfor centuries—surely would have found it and rescued her ally.\nHe also wants to transport Stormlight offworld, Shallan thought,\nemerging. I believe he was honest in that point. So perhaps these two are\nrelated? Perhaps Ba-Ado-Mishram can help him in this quest?\nYou’d do better at connecting these ideas than I will, Radiant thought to\nher. Why don’t you take control?\nIs that what this is? Shallan demanded. You’re trying to trick me? Go\nfind the spy.\nIt is not my area of expertise, Shallan.\nFine, she thought. It’s time to let Veil out then. I vote to end her\npunishment.\nRadiant subsided, and Veil surprisingly found herself in control. It had\nbeen four days now since she’d taken over and invited the three most\nquestionable Lightweavers to join the expedition.\nShe leaped to her feet, looking around the barge. It felt good to be in\ncharge again, particularly in this place of mystery and secrets. Shadesmar.\nThe bead ocean, a black sky, strange spren, and infinite questions to\ninvestigate. It was …\nIt was the perfect place for Shallan.\nFind the spy, Shallan said.\nVeil hesitated, then sat back down and pointedly dug through Shallan’s\nsatchel. She got out a charcoal pencil and flipped to an empty page, then\nbegan to draw.\nWhat are you doing? Shallan demanded. You’re a terrible artist.\n“I know,” Veil whispered. “And you hate watching me try.” She made a\ncrude attempt at drawing Ua’pam, the peakspren, as he thumped past. The\nresult was cringeworthy.\nWhy? Shallan asked.\n“I’m sorry,” Veil said, “for violating the compact. I needed to get those\nthree on the mission so I could watch them. But I should have persuaded\nyou two first.”\nSo go investigate.\n“Radiant is right,” Veil said. “That can wait.” It was painful for her to\nadmit, but something was more important. She continued her terrible\ndrawing.\nWe’re not going to let you retreat and hide, Radiant thought—and Veil\ncould feel her relief in discovering the two of them agreed on this.\nSomething is wrong, Shallan. Something bigger than what Veil did.\nSomething that’s affecting all of us, making us erratic.\n“I used to think you kept secrets from Adolin because you were like me\nand enjoyed the thrill of being part of the Ghostbloods,” Veil said. “I was\nwrong. There’s something more, isn’t there? Why do you keep lying? What\nis going on?”\nI … Shallan said. I …"

Formless, the personality that could be.\nThe dark thing that represented Shallan’s fears, compounded.\nVeil had her flaws. She was a drunkard and had trouble with scope and\nperspective. She represented a whole host of attributes Shallan wanted, but\nknew she shouldn’t.\nYet at her core, Veil had a singular purpose: She’d been created to\nprotect Shallan. And she would send herself to Damnation before she let\nthat Formless thing take her place.\nShe gripped her pencil and started drawing Adolin. Really, really poorly.\nI don’t care, Shallan thought.\nVeil gave him a unibrow.\nVeil …\nVeil drew him with crossed eyes.\nThat’s going too far.\nVeil put him in an ugly coat. And cut-off, knee-length trousers.\n“Fine!” Shallan said, ripping the page out of the sketchbook and\nwadding it up. “You win. Insufferable woman.” She settled back against the\nbarge’s railing and took a deep breath. Then, as the other two insisted, she\nlet herself relax.\nIt really … really was all right. Yes, someone had used the\ncommunication cube to call Mraize. Yes, someone had invaded her things.\nYes, one of her friends was undoubtedly a spy. But she could handle the\nproblem. She could get through this.\nBut they had two weeks of travel ahead of them. So today, she could\nrelax. Because she was on a barge full of spren, and they were all so\nfascinating. Storms, how had she let herself retreat at a time like this? And\nfor Veil to give up so willingly …\nI’m sorry, Veil thought. I’ll do better. And we can work on the spy\nanother time.\nRight, then. Shallan pointedly ripped up the sketch of Adolin and stuffed\nthe pieces in her satchel, then gripped her charcoal pencil and allowed\nherself to just draw.\n* * *\nAdolin found her five hours later, still sitting on the deck, her back to the\nrailing, sketching furiously. He’d brought her food—warm curry and lavis,\nfrom the smell of it. That would be some of the last “real” food they’d have\nfor a while. A part of her acknowledged the way the scents made her\nstomach growl. But for the moment, she remained mesmerized as she\nworked on her sketches of the peakspren.\nIt felt so good to let go and draw. To not worry about a mission, or her\nown psychosis, or even about Adolin. To become so wrapped up in the art\nthat nothing else mattered. There was an infinite sensation to creation, as if\ntime smeared like paint on a canvas. Mutable. Changeable.\nWhen she finally drifted out of it to the scent of sweet curry and the sight\nof Adolin smiling as he sat down beside her, she felt worlds better. More\nwhole.

The Ghostbloods seem to be\nsearching for Ba-Ado-Mishram, one of the Unmade. But I can’t determine\nfor certain what they intend to do once they find her.”\nAdolin grunted. “And the spy? Among our numbers?”\n“Still working on it,” she said. “But I’d rather not talk about that today. I\nneed some time to mull it over.” She took another bite, feeling his chest\nagainst her back. “You’re tense, Adolin. Aren’t we supposed to be able to\nrelax, this part of the trip?”\n“I’m worried about the mission.”\n“Because of what Syl said? About the honorspren being unlikely to\nlisten?”\nHe nodded.\n“If they turn us away, they turn us away,” she said. “But you can’t blame\nyourself for things that haven’t happened yet.

Pattern always talked about how strange humans\nwere, surviving off the things they destroyed.\n“When I left my homeland,” she said to Adolin, “I thought I knew what I\nwas heading into. But I had no idea what would happen to me. Where I’d\nend up.”\n“You had a pretty good idea,” Adolin said. “You set out to be Jasnah’s\nward, and you managed it.”\n“I set out to rob her,” Shallan said softly. She felt Adolin shift, looking\ntoward her. “My family was impoverished, threatened by creditors, my\nfather dead. We thought maybe I could rob that heretic Alethi woman, steal\nher Soulcaster—then we could use it to become rich again.”\nShe braced herself for the criticism. The shock.\nInstead, Adolin laughed. Bless him, he laughed. “Shallan, that is the\nmost ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard!”\n“Isn’t it though?” she said, twisting and grinning at him.\n“Robbing Jasnah.”\n“Yes.”\n“Robbing Jasnah.”\n“I know!”\nHe eyed her, then his grin broadened. “She’s never mentioned this, so I\nbet you did it, didn’t you? At least, you fooled her for a little while?”\nStorms, I love this man, she thought. For his humor, his brightness, his\ngenuine goodness. With that smile, brighter than the cold Shadesmar sun,\nshe became Shallan. Deeply and fully.\n“I totally did,” she whispered to him. “I swapped it for a fake one, and\nalmost escaped.

To create on the spot. As if you don’t prepare them\nahead of time?”\n“Never.”\n“Yeah? I’ve noticed you often seem to have one ready when you meet\nsomeone.”\n“Well, of course. That kind of joke is a great greeting. They’re supposed\nto be hilarious.”\nHe frowned.\n“As in,” she added, “not goodbyelarious.”\nHe stared at her. Then he went a little cross-eyed.\nHa! Veil thought. HA!\n“Oh dear,” Shallan said. “Did I break you?”\n“But … ‘hilarious’ doesn’t start with a ‘hi’ sound.… It doesn’t make\nsense.…”\n“It was a stealth joke,” Shallan said. “Hiding in plain sight, like a\nLightweaver. That’s what makes it genius.”\n“Genius? Shallan, that was awful.”\n“You’re full of awe,” she said. “Got it.” She smiled and snuggled against\nhim, relaxing as she set down her bowl and took her sketchbook from him.\nShe would finish her meal after she drew a little more. The moment\ndemanded it.\nAdolin put his arm around her and watched, then whistled softly. “Those\nsketches are really good, Shallan. Even for you. Have you done any\nothers?”\nFeeling warm, she turned the page to show off the cultivationspren she’d\ndrawn. “I’d like to find both male and female subjects for each variety of\nspren. There might not be time for it on this trip, but it occurred to me that\nno one, at least not in the modern era, has ever done a natural history of the\nRadiant spren.”"

There might not be time for it on this trip, but it occurred to me that\nno one, at least not in the modern era, has ever done a natural history of the\nRadiant spren.”\n“This is wonderful,” he said. “And thank you. For helping me relax.\nYou’re right—I can’t know what is coming. The entire situation could\nchange by the time we reach the honorspren. I’ll try to remember that.” He\nwrapped his arm loosely around her, the skin of his hand brushing her face.\n“Anything I can help you with?”\n“Help me get the clothing correct?” she asked, turning back to the\npeakspren page. “I feel like this garment pinned to the shoulder isn’t\nhanging right in the picture.…”\nThey moved on to light topics. A piece of Shallan felt like she should be\ndoing something more important, but Veil whispered a promise. They’d\nworry about the spy on the next day. Work on something else for a while.\nThen approach the problem fresh.\nYou told Adolin about robbing Jasnah, Radiant said. Well done. It wasn’t\nso bad, was it?\nNo. It hadn’t been. But that was the least of her crimes. Others were\ndarker, hidden deeply—so deeply she honestly couldn’t remember them.\nAnd didn’t want to.\nEventually, the strange mistspren drifted near. The creature’s free-form\nshape seemed like it would be difficult to capture in a sketch. Like steam,\nsomehow trapped into a humanoid shape, contained by clothing and that\nstrange mask.\nShe flipped to a new page and began drawing, but the spren—who had\nintroduced herself as Dreaming-though-Awake—peeked at the sketchbook.\n“Oh,” she said. “It is just me?”\n“What did you expect?” Adolin asked.\n“She mentioned the Unmade earlier,” Dreaming-though-Awake said. “I\nthought she might be drawing them.”\nShallan paused, lifting her pencil. “Do you know anything of the\nUnmade?”\n“Hardly anything,” the spren said. “What do you want to know?”\n“What happened to Ba-Ado-Mishram?” Shallan asked, eager. “What was\nshe like? How did she Connect to the singers, and how did trapping her\ncause them to become parshmen?”\n“Excellent questions,” the spren said.\n“And…” Adolin prompted.\n“I told you, I know hardly anything,” she replied. “I find the questions\nfascinating. What you wonder tells me so much.” She began to move off.\n“Seriously?” Shallan said. “You don’t know anything about Ba-Ado-\nMishram.”\n“I was not alive when she was free,” the spren said. “If you wish to\nknow more, ask the Heralds. I have heard several were there for her\nbinding. Nalan. Kelek. Find them; ask them.” She walked off, more drifting\nthan stepping, though she did have legs and feet.\n“That one makes me uncomfortable,” Adolin said.\n“Yeah,” Shallan said, setting aside the sketchbook and picking up her\nbowl of food—now cold, but still tasty. “But that’s comforting, in a way.\nSpren should be alien, should have their own ways of thinking and talking.

I\nlike that Dreaming-though-Awake is a little weird.”\n“You simply like the company,” Adolin said.\nShe smiled, but the words the spren had said lingered with her. Heralds\nwere there. And the Heralds were a major focus of the Sons of Honor—\nwhose leader Mraize has sent me to hunt.\nIt was all connected. She had to figure out how to unravel it all. Without\nunraveling herself.\nWhimsy was not terribly useful, and Mercy worries me. I do think that\nValor is reasonable, and suggest you approach her again. It has been\ntoo long, in her estimation, since your last conversation.\n“I’m sorry, Brightlord,” the ardent said as she walked through the room,\npicking up cushions from the floor and stacking them in her arms. “I do\nknow the man you’re searching for, but he’s not here anymore.”\n“You discharged him?” Kaladin asked, walking at her side.\n“No, Brightlord. Not exactly.” She handed the stack of cushions to him,\nclearly expecting him to hold them as she walked to the next row and began\ngathering those.\nKaladin followed, balancing the stack of pillows. He and Teft were still\ntrying to track down the refugee woman’s missing uncle. His name was\nNoril, and Kaladin’s father remembered the man. Not surprising,\nconsidering Lirin’s near-superhuman ability to recall people and faces.\nNoril, who had lost an arm sometime in the past, had arrived in\nHearthstone on the same day Kaladin had brought the flying ship. Noril had\ndisplayed signs of severe shock, so Lirin had taken extra care of him,\nmaking sure the man was on the airship for the flight to Urithiru.\nAfter the ship arrived, things got chaotic. Overwhelmed by the number\nof refugees and their ailments, Lirin had sent Noril to the ardents. So, that\nwas where Kaladin and Teft had come today. It felt odd to be spending so\nmuch time personally looking for one man when there were many patients\nto see. Coming here wasn’t particularly effective triage.\nUnfortunately, that was a part of being a surgeon that Kaladin had never\nmastered. Giving up on one to save two others? Sure, it was great in\nprinciple. But doing it hurt.\nKaladin walked alongside the ardent while Teft leaned against the wall\nnear the entrance to the room. It was otherwise empty, though some kind of\ntraining or teaching had plainly been going on earlier, judging by the rows\nof cushions.\n“If you didn’t let Noril go,” Kaladin said, “what happened to him?”\n“We sent him on,” the ardent explained. She was holding so many\ncushions, he couldn’t see her through them. “My devotary cares for\nphysical ailments. We help rehabilitate those who have lost limbs, eyes, or\ntheir hearing in battle. He had only one arm, yes, but his wounds ran\ndeeper.”\nThere were three cushions left on the floor, and when she tried to bend to\npick them up, her stack teetered. So Kaladin held out his hand for her stack."

So Kaladin held out his hand for her stack.\nThen he held out his other hand as well.\n“You can’t carry them all,” she said. “Let’s…”\nShe trailed off as she saw what Kaladin had done. The stack he’d\noriginally been holding—now Lashed upward just enough—remained\nfloating in the air beside him.\n“Oh,” she said, then inspected him more closely. “Oh! You’re Brightlord\nStormblessed!”\nKaladin nudged the floating stack of cushions so they lazily floated over\ntoward the far wall—where other unused cushions were piled—then took\nher stack.\nThe ardent quickly grabbed the last three, blushing as she walked him\nover to the wall. “I had no idea who you were! I’m sorry, Radiant.”\n“It’s fine,” Kaladin said. “Don’t make anything of it, please.” As if being\nlighteyed wasn’t bad enough.\n“Well, the man you want,” she said, “we couldn’t help him. We … did\ntry to keep him rather than sending him on. We knew he was in bad shape,\nafter all. But…”\n“Bad shape?” Kaladin asked.\n“Oh yes,” she said. “Last week we caught him trying to hang himself.\nThe surgeon who sent him here warned us to watch for it, fortunately, so we\nsaved him. Then we sent him on to the Devotary of Mercy. They care for\nthose who … have trouble with their minds.”\n“You knew he might be a danger to himself,” Teft said, walking up, “and\nyou didn’t send him there immediately?”\n“We … no,” she said. “We didn’t.”\n“Irresponsible,” Teft said.\n“My father knew and sent him here first,” Kaladin reminded Teft. “I’m\nsure the ardents did what they could.”\n“Go to level four, Brightlord,” she said. “Right near the center, along\nNorthbeam and not quite to the Aladar Princedom.”\nHe set down the last of the cushions and nodded to Teft, and the two of\nthem began the hike. Everything in Urithiru was a hike, especially on the\nlower floors.\nShallan always knew her way around just by the strata on the walls,\nwhich waved in colorful lines as different layers of rock had been cut\nthrough to make the tunnel. Kaladin considered himself good with\ndirections, but he had to use the painted lines on the floor to get anywhere.\n“Still can’t believe how much of this place hasn’t been explored,” Teft\nsaid as they walked.\n“I suspect by now most of it has been explored,” Kaladin said.\n“Brightness Navani’s teams have mapped all the lower levels, and done\nwalk-throughs of all the upper ones.”\n“Walk-throughs, yes,” Teft said, eyeing a dark corridor. “But explored?\nYou might walk the woods every day and never see one out of a hundred\nthings in there watching you.”\nAs they struck inward, they saw fewer people.

        "text": "Stormlight lanterns locked tight and bolted to the walls—dwindled behind,\nand they needed handheld spheres for light. There was a certain eeriness to\nthese inner sections of the tower. Most everyone lived and worked on the\nrim. The only times they would strike inward would be to visit the atrium or\none of the first-floor markets. He’d noted people taking long walks all the\nway around the rim to one of the lit corridors rather than cutting through the\ndarker center. Storms, he’d found himself doing the same thing.\nThere was still space on the rim of the fifth and sixth floors, so why had\nthis monastery chosen such an inward section? He was glad when they\neventually reached a section of hallway that had permanent lanterns again.\nPaint on the floor indicated they were approaching Aladar’s princedom. A\nright turn at a large intersection with glyphs on the floor led them to the\nmonastery—marked by a large wooden door blocking the way forward,\npainted with a glyphpair in the shape of the Vorin sword, indicating a\nreligious building.\n“Building” was, of course, a stretch. Generally for a small complex like\nthis, people would find an area with a grouping of different-sized rooms and\nhallways and divide them off with a few doors at key entry points. Someone\nwas monitoring the door, for it swung open as they approached, revealing a\nyounger male ardent.\n“Brightlord,” the man said, bowing. He squinted at Teft, trying to pick\nout his eye color. Then he bowed again. “Brightlord.”\nTeft grumbled at that. These days, after being Radiant for as long as they\nhad, their eyes rarely faded anymore. And there was no stopping him from\ncomplaining about being a lighteyes. Unlike Kaladin, who had gotten over\nit ages ago.\n“If you have come to commission prayers or burn glyphwards, I would\ndirect you toward the Devotary of Kelek, a little farther outward from\nhere,” the ardent said, polishing a pair of spectacles and squinting at\nKaladin. “We don’t take prayer commissions here.”\n“Pardon,” Kaladin said. “But we’re not wanting prayers. Did you receive\na patient recently who was missing an arm? His family is looking for him,\nand we’re helping track him down.”\n“Can’t reveal patient information,” the man said in a bored tone, putting\non his spectacles—then cursing softly and pulling them off again and\nrubbing them on his shirt, trying to get a spot he’d apparently missed. “I’d\nneed the authorization of at least a highlord of the third dahn. Otherwise,\nspeak to Sister Yara for normal visitation requests. I have a form\nsomewhere for your wife to fill out.”\nTeft glanced at Kaladin.\n“You do it,” Kaladin said. “Syl’s out for her morning flight, and she’ll\nsnap at me if I call her back early.”\nTeft sighed and reached his hands out, making a silvery Shardspear\nappear. The Stormlight in the three nearest lanterns went out, streaming into\nhim, setting his eyes aglow. A luminescent mist began to rise from his skin.\nEven his beard seemed to shine, and his clothing—once so pedestrian—\nrippled as he rose into the air about a foot."

A luminescent mist began to rise from his skin.\nEven his beard seemed to shine, and his clothing—once so pedestrian—\nrippled as he rose into the air about a foot.\nThe ardent stopped polishing his spectacles. He squinted at Teft, as if\nforgetting what was in his hands. “Oh. Brightlord Radiant,” he said, then\nbowed reverently first to Teft, then to Kaladin—though the man didn’t seem\nto recognize Kaladin. “Brightlord Radiant. I will see to your request.”\nKaladin didn’t much care for the reverence people showed them. People\nwho had once spat after hearing someone speak of the “Lost Radiants” had\nturned around quickly when their highprince and their queen had each\nbecome one. It made Kaladin wonder how quickly these people might turn\non them, if reverence suddenly became unfashionable.\nThat said, there were perks. Particularly with the ardents, who had\nquickly pointed out that Vorinism had always been closely aligned with the\nKnights Radiant. This one let them in now, absently tucking his spectacles\nin his robe’s breast pocket. He led them to a records room, stacked with\nledgers and paper, and asked one of the ardents inside to watch the door\nwhile he saw to their “esteemed guests.” There wasn’t much enthusiasm in\nhis tone, but he didn’t seem the enthusiastic type.\n“One arm…” the ardent said, searching a ledger near the door.\n“Name is Noril,” Teft said. “Doesn’t seem he’d have any reason to go by\na false one.”\n“He’s here, Brightlord,” the ardent said, leaning in close and pointing at\nwords on the page. He patted at his robe’s lower pockets, as if searching for\nhis spectacles. “He told us he has no living relatives though. Maybe it’s a\ndifferent person. Ah, and he’s on watch for suicide, Brightlords. One\nunsuccessful attempt. A profoundly disturbed man.”\n“Show us to him,” Kaladin said.\nThe ardent finally found his spectacles, but just started wiping them\nagain. He led the way out of the records room and down a dark corridor lit\nby infrequently placed lanterns.\nKaladin followed, raising a sphere to give the place more light. As if it\nweren’t bad enough to be trapped deep in the tower, away from light and\nwind. Did they have to make it so dim as well? He couldn’t help but be\nreminded of his days in prison, following that time he’d helped Adolin in\nthe arena. Kaladin had been locked up on dozens of occasions, but that one\nhad felt the worst. Sitting in there fuming, stewing, festering. Feeling that\nthe winds and the open sky had been stolen from him …\nDark times. Ones he’d rather not remember.\nThey passed door after door alongside the corridor, each marked by a\nnumeric glyph. He saw not a few gloomspren around. The doors had small\nwindows in them, but Kaladin assumed the dark cells beyond were unused\n—at least until he heard a voice muttering from one of them. At that, he\nstopped and held up his sphere, looking in. A woman sat in the featureless\ncell, her back to a bare wall, rocking back and forth as she muttered"

A woman sat in the featureless\ncell, her back to a bare wall, rocking back and forth as she muttered\nsomething unintelligible.\n“How many of these rooms have people in them?” Kaladin asked.\n“Hm? Oh, most of them,” the ardent said. “We’re a little understaffed, to\nbe honest, Brightlord. We took in patients from most all the princedoms\nwhen we consolidated here. If you could bring the matter to the queen’s\nattention…”\n“You lock them in here?” Teft demanded. “In the dark?”\n“Many of the mentally deficient react poorly to overstimulation,” the\nardent said. “We work hard to give them quiet, calm places to live, free of\nbright lights.”\n“How do you know?” Kaladin asked, striding after the ardent.\n“The therapy is prescribed by some of the best thinkers among the\nardentia.”\n“But how do you know?” Kaladin said. “Do any of them get better?\nHave you tried multiple theories and compared them? Have you tested\ndifferent cures or remedies on different patient populations?”\n“There are no cures for mental ailments, Brightlord,” the ardent said.\n“Even the Edgedancers can’t do anything for them, unless their state is\nrelated to a recent brain trauma.” He stopped beside a specific door\nscratched with the glyph for twenty-nine. “With all due respect, Brightlord,\nyou should leave medical issues to those trained in them.” He rapped on the\ndoor with his knuckles. “This is him.”\n“Open the door,” Kaladin said.\n“Brightlord, he might be dangerous.”\n“Has he ever attacked anyone?” Kaladin asked. “Has he hurt anyone\nother than himself?”\n“No,” the ardent said, “but the insane can be unpredictable. You could be\nharmed.”\n“Lad,” Teft said, “you could stick us with a hundred swords, and we’d\njust complain that our outfits got ruined. Open the storming door.”\n“Oh. Um, all right.” He fished in his pocket, came out with his\nspectacles, then fished in the other one until he found a ring of keys. He\nheld the keys close to his nose one by one to see the glyphs on them, then\nfinally unlocked the door.\nKaladin stepped in, his sapphire broam revealing a figure who lay\nhuddled on the floor by the wall. There was some straw for a bed beside the\nother wall, but the man wasn’t using it.\n“Can’t give him blankets or sheets,” the ardent explained, peeking in.\n“Might try to strangle himself.”\n“Noril?” Kaladin asked, hesitant. “Noril, are you awake?”\nThe man didn’t say anything, though he did stir. Kaladin stepped closer,\nnoting the sewn-up sleeve. The man was missing his entire left arm. The\nroom didn’t smell too bad, all things considered, so at least the ardents kept\nhim clean. The clothing was barely shorts and a thin shirt.\n“Noril,” Kaladin said, kneeling. “Your niece, Cressa, is looking for you.\nYou aren’t alone. You have family.”\n“Tell her I’m dead,” the man whispered. “Please.”\n“She’s worried about you,” Kaladin said."

I\nknow that feeling, Kaladin thought. I’ve been there. He looked around the\nsilent chamber cut off from the sunlight and wind.\nThis was so, so wrong.\n“Can you stand?” he asked Noril. “I won’t force you to go talk to her. I\nmerely want to take you somewhere else.”\nNoril didn’t reply.\nKaladin leaned closer. “I know how you feel. Dark, like there’s never\nbeen light in the world. Like everything in you is a void, and you wish you\ncould just feel something. Anything. Pain would at least tell you you’re\nalive. Instead you feel nothing. And you wonder, how can a man breathe,\nbut already be dead?”\nNoril turned his head, looking at Kaladin and blinking eyes red from\nlack of sleep. He wore a rough beard, unkempt.\n“Come with me and talk,” Kaladin said. “That’s all you have to do.\nAfterward, if you want me to tell your niece that you’re dead, I will. You\ncan come back here and rot. But if you don’t come now, I’m going to keep\nannoying you. I’m good at it. Trust me; I learned from the best.”\nKaladin stood up and offered a hand. Noril took it and let Kaladin haul\nhim to his feet. They walked toward the door.\n“What is this?” the ardent said. “You can’t let him out. He’s in our\ncharge! We have to care for…”\nHe trailed off as Kaladin fixed him with a stare. Storms. Anyone would\nturn suicidal if kept in here too long.\n“Lad,” Teft said, pulling the ardent gently out of the way, “I wouldn’t\nconfront Brightlord Stormblessed right now. Not if you value keeping all\nyour bits attached to you.”\nKaladin led Noril out of the monastery and straight toward the rim of the\ntower. Teft joined him, and the ardent—Kaladin hadn’t asked his name—\ntrailed along behind. He didn’t go running for help, fortunately, but he\nclearly wasn’t willing to let them just leave with a patient either.\nNoril walked quietly, and Kaladin let him adjust to the idea of being out\nof his cell.\n“Kelek’s breath,” Teft muttered to Kaladin. “I was too harsh on that lady\nardent. I chewed her out for keeping Noril instead of sending him to the\nexperts—but if that’s what the experts were going to do, I see why she’d\nhesitate.”\nKaladin nodded. Soon after, Syl came zipping through the corridor.\n“There you are,” she said.\n“Honorspren can feel where their knight is,” Kaladin said. “So you don’t\nneed to act surprised at finding me.”\nSyl gave an exaggerated eye roll, and he swore she made her eyes bigger\nfor emphasis.\n“What are we doing?” she said, landing on his shoulder and sitting\nprimly with her legs crossed and her hands on her knees. “Actually, I don’t"

They’re\nsomehow so gross that they’re cute. So cute I could have died! Except I\ncan’t, because I’m an eternal sliver of God himself, and we have standards\nabout things like that.”\n“Well, glad you’re feeling better.”\n“Yeah,” she said. “Me too.” She pointed toward Noril. “You found him, I\nsee. Taking him to his niece?”\n“Not yet,” Kaladin said.\nHe led Noril past a large corridor where people flowed in both directions.\nAcross that, at long last, they stepped onto a balcony. A larger communal\none, like the one by his clinic.\nNoril stopped in the archway, his eyes watering as he looked up at the\nsky. Teft took him by the arm and led him out a little farther, to where some\nchairs were set beside the railing, overlooking the mountains.\nKaladin stepped up to the railing, and didn’t say anything at first.\nNoril finally spoke. “Is she all right? My niece?”\n“She’s worried about you,” Kaladin said, turning and settling into one of\nthe seats. “My father—the surgeon you met in Hearthstone—says that you\nhad a rough time of things before he met you.”\nThe man nodded, his stare hollow. He’d lost his family in a brutal way,\nLirin had said, while being unable to help.\n“For some of us,” Kaladin said, “it piles up bit by little bit. Until we\nrealize we’re drowning. I thought I had it bad, but I suppose I wouldn’t\ntrade places with you. Getting hit all at once like that…”\nNoril shrugged.\n“Nightmares?” Teft asked.\n“Yeah,” he said. “I can’t remember the details. Maybe that’s some mercy\nfrom the Almighty.” He took a deep breath, tipping his head back to see the\nsky. “I don’t deserve mercy. I don’t deserve anything.”\n“You just want to stop existing,” Kaladin said. “You don’t want to\nactually kill yourself, not on most days. But you figure it sure would be\nconvenient if you weren’t around anymore.”\n“Better for everyone to not have to deal with me,” Noril said.\nSyl landed again on Kaladin’s shoulder and leaned forward, watching\nNoril with an intense expression.\n“It wouldn’t be, you know,” Kaladin said. “Better for everyone, if you\nvanished. Your niece loves you. Your return would make her life better.”\n“I can’t feel that way,” Noril said.\n“I know. That’s why you need someone to tell it to you. You need\nsomeone to talk to, Noril, when the darkness is strong. Someone to remind\nyou the world hasn’t always been this way; that it won’t always be this\nway.”\n“How do you … know this?” Noril asked.\n“I’ve felt it,” Kaladin said. “Feel it most days.”\nNoril turned toward Teft."

Still try to sometimes, but I keep reminding myself that’s\nthe easy path. It isn’t what they would have wanted of me, you know?”\n“Yeah,” Noril said, sitting back. He still had that haunted cast to his eyes,\nbut he at least seemed to be breathing more deeply. “Thank you. For\nbringing me out of that place. For talking to me.”\nKaladin glanced at the ardent, who hovered behind them. Teft kept Noril\ntalking—not about anything important, just where he was from. Apparently\nhe’d lost his arm years ago, in a different event than when he’d lost his\nfamily.\nThe more he talked, the better he seemed to feel. Not cured, by any\nmeans. But better.\nKaladin rose and approached the ardent, who had settled down on a\nstone bench that was part of the balcony. The man had put on his spectacles,\nand was staring at Noril.\n“He’s talking,” the ardent said. “We haven’t been able to get more than a\ngrunt out of him.”\n“That’s not surprising,” Kaladin said. “When you’re like him, it’s hard to\nfeel like doing anything—even talking. Storms … when it’s bad for me, I\nthink I want anything but someone to talk to. I’m wrong though. While you\ncan’t force it, having someone to talk to usually helps. You should be letting\nhim meet with others who feel like he does.”\n“That’s not in the book of treatments,” the ardent said. “It says we\nshould keep lunatics away from each other. Talking together would make\nthem feed off one another’s melancholy.”\n“I could see that happening,” Kaladin said. “But do you really know for\ncertain? Have you tried it?”\n“No,” the ardent said. Seeming embarrassed, he glanced away from\nKaladin. “I know you’re angry at us, Brightlord. But we do what we can.\nMost people, they want to ignore men like him. They shove them off to the\nardents. You might think us callous, but we’re the only ones who care. Who\ntry.”\n“I don’t think you’re callous,” Kaladin said. “I think you’re simply\napproaching this wrong. In surgery, we know that a man in shock should be\nrepositioned so that his feet are up, his head down. But someone who has a\nwound to the back or neck should never be moved, not until we determine\nthe extent of the damage. Different ailments, different wounds, can require\nseverely different treatments. Tell me, what treatments do you give a person\nwith melancholia?”\n“We…” The ardent swallowed. “Keep them away from anything that\nmight aggravate or disturb them. Keep them clean. Let them be in peace.”\n“And someone with aggressive tendencies?” Kaladin asked.\n“The same,” the ardent admitted.\n“Battle shock? Seeing hallucinations?”\n“You know my answer already, Brightlord.”\n“Someone needs to do better for these people,” Kaladin said. “Someone"

Seeing hallucinations?”\n“You know my answer already, Brightlord.”\n“Someone needs to do better for these people,” Kaladin said. “Someone\nneeds to talk to them, try different treatments, see what they think works.\nWhat actually helps.” Storms, he sounded like his father. “We need to study\ntheir responses, use an empirical approach to treatment instead of just\nassuming someone who has suffered mental trauma is permanently broken.”\n“That all sounds great, Brightlord,” the ardent said. “But do you realize\nhow much of a fight it would be to change the minds of the head ardents?\nDo you realize how much money and time it would cost to do what you’re\nsuggesting? We don’t have the resources for that.”\nHe looked to Noril, who had tipped his head back, his eyes closed,\nfeeling the sunlight on his skin. Syl had landed on the chair beside him and\nwas studying him as one might a grand painting.\nKaladin felt a stirring deep within him. He’d worried that working with\nhis father wouldn’t be truly fulfilling. He’d worried that he wouldn’t be able\nto protect people, as his oaths drove him to do. That he would make an\ninferior surgeon.\nBut if there was one thing he understood that most ardents and surgeons\n—even his father—did not, it was this.\n“Release this man to my care,” Kaladin said. “And warn your superiors I\nwill be coming for others. The ardents can complain all the way to\nBrightness Navani if they want. They’ll get the same answer from her that\nI’m giving you now: We’re going to try something new.”\nThe deaths of both Devotion and Dominion trouble me greatly, as I\nhad not realized this immense power we held was something that could\nbe broken in such a way. On my world, the power always gathered and\nsought a new Vessel.\nThe fourth day of the trip, Shallan was truly enjoying herself. The closest\nthey’d come to danger was when they’d spotted a pair of Fused soaring past\nin the distance three days ago. The humans had quickly scrambled into their\nhiding place—the tarp stretched between two piles of goods at the rear of\nthe barge—but they needn’t have worried. The Fused hadn’t deviated in the\nbarge’s direction.\nOther than that one event, she’d been able to spend her time in carefree\ndrawing. Except, of course, when the Cryptics found her.\nThey loved to watch her draw. Currently, all four of them—Pattern, plus\nthe three bonded to her agents—surrounded her. As a group, they hummed\nand buzzed and bounced up and down, watching as she tried to sketch\nUa’pam standing on the high deck of the barge.\nShe’d grown accustomed to Pattern’s presence. She was fond of it, in\nfact—she enjoyed the way he’d hum when he heard something he knew\nwas untrue, or the way he’d pipe up with questions about the most mundane\nof human activities. But when all four crowded around, Shallan’s serenity\nstarted building toward panic instead.\nShe’d almost forgotten how frightened she’d been when his strange\nsymbol-headed figure had begun appearing in her drawings.

Fleeing through the hallways of Kharbranth, her\nsanity unraveling as she sketched the hallway behind her, filled with\nCryptics. She’d been peeking into Shadesmar. Her unconscious mind had\nbegun to perceive spren as they appeared in the Cognitive Realm.\nThe same tension twisted her insides now, making her pencil lines sharp\nand stark. She tried to suppress the feeling. There was no reason for her to\nfeel like she needed to run, scramble, scream.\nHer lines were too dark, too rigid, to properly capture the Memory of\nUa’pam standing with one foot up on the railing, looking like an explorer\nsetting out for adventure. She tried to make herself relax, drawing a fanciful\nimage of sunlight streaming around him. That, however, made the four\nCryptics start humming in excitement.\n“Could you all step back and give me more room?” Shallan asked the\ncreatures.\nThey didn’t cock their heads like humans might have, but she could\nsense confusion in the way their patterns sped up. Then, as if one, all four\ntook exactly one step backward. They then proceeded to lean in even closer.\nShallan sighed, and as she kept drawing, she got Ua’pam’s arm wrong.\nSpren were hard, because they didn’t quite have human proportions. The\nCryptics started humming with excitement.\n“That’s not a lie!” Shallan said, reaching for her eraser. “It’s a mistake,\nyou nitwits.”\n“Mmmm…” Ornament said. Beryl’s Cryptic had a fine pattern, delicate\nlike lace, and a squeaky voice. “Nitwit! I am a nitwit. Mmmm.”\n“A nitwit is a stupid person or spren,” Pattern explained. “But she said it\nin an endearing way!”\n“Stupidly endearing!” Mosaic said. She was Vathah’s Cryptic, and her\npattern had sharp lines to it. She often included rapid fast sections that\nwaved like the women’s script. “Contradiction! Wonderful and blessed\ncontradiction of nonsense and human complication to be alive!”\nMotif, Ishnah’s Cryptic, simply made a bunch of clicking noises in rapid\nsuccession. His Alethi was not good, so he preferred to speak in the Cryptic\nlanguage. The others began rapidly clicking to one another, and in the\noverlapping cacophony, she lost track of Pattern. For a moment they were\nall just a clump of alien creatures, huddled together with their patterns\nalmost touching. The nearby sound of beads slapping against one another\nseemed the chatter of hundreds of Cryptics. Thousands of them. Watching\nher. Always watching her …\nRadiant came to her rescue. Radiant, who had trained to ignore the chaos\nof battle, with its distracting sounds and constant yelling. When she took\nover, she brought with her a stability. She couldn’t draw, so she tucked\naway the pad. She excused herself from the Cryptics and made her way to\nthe stern of the barge, where she watched the rolling beads until Shallan\nrecovered and emerged.\n“Thank you,” she said as Radiant withdrew.\nShallan listened to the peaceful rolling of the beads, endlessly surging."

And after several\ndays on the barge spent drawing, it was time to dive into the problem of\nfinding the spy. She took a deep breath, and submitted to Veil.\nNo, Veil said.\n… No?\nYou said we could look for the spy today, Shallan said.\nWe are. You. With my help.\nIs this, Shallan asked, penance because you broke the compact?\nIn a way. I want to coach you through a little espionage.\nI don’t need to know it, she thought. I have you.\nHumor me, kid. I need this.\nShallan sighed, but agreed. They couldn’t share skills, as evidenced by\nVeil’s drawing abilities. She knew espionage, Radiant could use a sword,\nand Shallan had their Lightweaving ability. And their sense of humor.\nOh please, Radiant thought.\n“So how do we start?” Shallan asked.\nWe need to test each of the three subjects, Veil said, and plant a—\nWait, Radiant thought. Shouldn’t we first make absolutely certain the\ncommunication device couldn’t have been moved another way? If we’re\nusing that as evidence that the spy is along on this mission?\nShallan ground her teeth. Veil sighed softly.\nBut both agreed that Radiant was, unfortunately, correct. So Shallan\nstrolled to the large tent they’d set up on the deck of the barge, using boxes\nand tarps. It was more like a large cave. While they didn’t need shelter from\nthe elements in Shadesmar, it made them feel comfortable.\nShallan ducked inside and went to the nook, made from boxes, that she\nshared with Adolin. She’d left the trunk unguarded—after all, she did want\nto catch the person doing this. She didn’t want to hover about the place and\nmake it obvious what she knew.\nFor now, she unlocked the trunk and checked on the device. It hadn’t\nbeen moved again, so far as she could tell. But she didn’t trust the trunk’s\nlock. Tyn had been able to pick most locks—and beyond that, in the\nPhysical Realm at least, spren could slip through openings like a keyhole.\nShe’d seen Syl do it, not to mention Pattern.\nShe closed the trunk and—checking to make sure no one could see her\naround the corner in the box-walled nook—she tipped the trunk to one side,\nthen the other. When she looked inside, the device had barely moved. She\nhad it packed tightly enough between books and art materials that it\ncouldn’t have flipped on its own.\nSatisfied? she asked.\nYes, Radiant said. It couldn’t have shifted faces without being removed\nfrom the trunk.\nAgreed, Veil said.\nAnd we didn’t do it, right? Radiant asked pointedly.\nIt was a discomforting question. They weren’t always aware of what one\nof them did when another was in control. Often these days they worked\ntogether, giving up control by conscious choice, helping one another. But\nthere were worse days. Shallan couldn’t remember all the things Veil had"

Shallan couldn’t remember all the things Veil had\ndone during that day she’d seized control, for example.\nI didn’t move it, Veil said. I promise.\nI didn’t either, Radiant said.\n“Nor did I,” Shallan whispered. And she knew it to be true. None of the\nThree had moved it, though she worried about Formless. Could part of her\nmind be betraying her? She didn’t think that piece was even aware, or real,\nyet.\nIt wasn’t us, Veil said. I know this, Shallan. You have to trust it.\nShe did. And that was what had disturbed her so much upon seeing the\ndevice moved. It was concrete proof that someone among her staff was\nlying to her.\nAll right, Veil said. I’ve gone over the places the trunk was out of our\nsight … and it’s not good. There were a ton of opportunities when it was\nalone back in Urithiru. We’re not going to get anywhere trying to discover\nwho had access to it, particularly not from this barge.\n“I still wish you’d do this part yourself,” Shallan whispered to her.\nTough. Go back out, and we’ll get started.\nAs she strode out, however, Pattern intercepted her. He walked up, his\nfingers laced before him. “Mmm…” he said. “I am sorry for earlier. For\ntheir overexcitement. The others do not have as much experience with\nhumans.”\n“They have their Radiants,” Shallan noted.\n“Yes. That is not humans. That is one human each.”\n“You only have me.”\n“No! Before you, I studied humans. I talked about them much. I am very\nfamous.”\n“Famous?”\n“Very famous.” His pattern sped up. “Cryptics do not often go into the\ncities of other spren. We are not liked. I went. I watched humans in\nShadesmar, as we had planned to find humans to bond again. The other\nCryptics were impressed by my bravery.”\n“Yes, very brave,” Shallan said. “We humans are known to bite.”\n“Ha ha. Yes, bite. And break your oaths and murder your spren. Ha ha.”\nShallan winced. True, those were the actions of other Radiants. Not\nRadiants from her generation. At least none of the noble ones, like Kaladin\nor Dalinar.\nNearby, in the center of the deck, the other three Cryptics were chatting\nwith their heads together in a huddle.\n“Do you think it strange,” Shallan asked, “that Cryptics would end up\nwith the Lightweavers, the order of Radiants with the most artists? You,\nwho cannot lie—and who are basically walking numerical equations?”\n“We can lie,” Pattern said. “We are simply bad at it in general. It is not\nodd to end up with you. We like you in the way that a person likes new\nfoods or new places. Besides, art is math.”\n“No it’s not,” Shallan said, offended. “Art and math are basically\nopposites.”\n“Mmm. No. All things are math. Art especially is math. You are math.”"

You are math.”\n“If so, I’m the type with a misplaced number hidden so deep in the\nequation, I can never find it—but always calculate out wrong.” She left\nPattern then, strolling across the deck of the barge, passing several\npeakspren with molten light shining out through the cracks in their skin.\nHigh overhead, clouds had formed—the familiar ones of this place that\npointed toward the distant sun like a roadway.\nThose clouds didn’t seem to move according to ordinary weather\npatterns, but appeared and disappeared as the barge moved. Was it\nsomething to do with the angle at which they were being seen?\nAll right, Veil, she thought. What do we do?\nThere are several ways to uncover a spy, Veil thought. We’re in a\nfortunate position, since we know they communicated directly with Mraize\nrecently—and will likely do so again. We also have three specific suspects, a\nmanageable number.\nWe’re going to try two different methods of finding the spy. The first is to\ncatch them in a lie or a past misdeed, then push them until they grow\nuncomfortable and admit to us more than they intended. Everyone has a\nguilty conscience about something.\n“Radiant doesn’t,” Shallan noted.\nDon’t be so sure, Veil replied. But if this method doesn’t work, we’ll try\nsomething else—something that takes longer, but is more likely to work. We\nwill find a way to feed each suspect a different tidbit of false information: a\ntidbit they will in turn feed to Mraize. Depending on which piece of\ninformation is leaked, we’ll know who did the leaking, and identify our spy.\nThat’s quite clever, Radiant noted.\nWell, it’s more standard than clever, Veil admitted. This is a time-tested\nmethod, and our biggest problem in using it is that I’m certain Mraize is\naware of it. So we’re going to have to be very subtle—and it might not\nwork, as it requires Mraize to not only be told this information, but to not be\nsuspicious of it, and to relate it back to us.\nFortunately, we have a long trip ahead of us, and so if neither of these\nmethods works, we can try something else. Point is, today, trying this will\nbe good practice for Shallan.\n“I don’t need practice,” she whispered. “I have you.”\nBut Veil was being stubborn, so Shallan wandered across the deck to\nwhere Ishnah was helping Ua’pam and Unativi—his cousin, who ran the\nbarge—as they manifested goods.\nThis was how almost everything—from clothing to building supplies—\nwas created in Shadesmar. Spren didn’t quarry stone or spin threads; they\ntook the souls of objects from the physical world, then “manifested” them.\nThe term referred to making the object’s bead on this side instead reflect its\nphysical nature.\nUa’pam held up a bead, inspecting it. Shallan could sense the souls of\nthings by touching beads, though Veil had more trouble, and Radiant\ncouldn’t do it at all. Spren also varied in skill in this area, and true ability to"

Spren also varied in skill in this area, and true ability to\nmanifest was somewhat rare.\nUa’pam pressed the bead against the deck, then held up a diamond chip\n—shining with Stormlight—in his other hand. He drew in the Light much\nas a Radiant would, breathing it into his lungs. She’d heard that this would\ninvigorate spren, making them feel alert and awake—they could feed on\nLight, even if they didn’t need it to survive. Today, Ua’pam immediately\nused this Stormlight to manifest the bead.\nThe hand with the soul pressed against the deck began to glow, then\nsomething blossomed underneath it. He stood up as an ornate wooden table\nemerged beneath his hand, growing like a plant at a highly accelerated\nspeed.\n“So fine!” his cousin—Unativi—said, clapping his hands. It sounded like\nrocks striking one another. “We are lucky! A grand table.”\nUa’pam, shoulders slumping from exhaustion, nodded and dropped the\ndrained sphere to the side for Ishnah to catch. Spren didn’t care much for\nthe value of most gemstones; it was the Light that interested them. The bead\nthat had been the table’s soul had vanished, replaced by the object.\nInterestingly, so far as Veil knew, the real table in the physical world would\nbe unaffected by this process.\nShallan focused her attention on Ishnah, who was now trying to sketch\nthe transformation process. Shallan had told the former thief to practice her\nart skills so she could better imitate lighteyed women.\n“You are surprised by how nice this table is,” Ishnah said to Unativi. She\nreached out to touch the table. “You didn’t know what would be created\nbefore this moment?”\n“No,” Unativi said. “Understand. I find furniture. I know it is furniture.\nBut how nice?” The peakspren spread his hands in a display of ignorance.\n“We must work more today,” Ua’pam explained. “Stormlight in gems\nruns out, but manifestations last long. Many months without reinfusion, if\ndone by one with skill.” He slapped the table. “I have skill.”\n“So you make as much cargo as you can,” Ishnah said, gesturing to the\nmany chairs, tables, and other articles of furniture surrounding them,\n“before the Stormlight we gave you runs out. Then you can sell what you\ncreated.”\n“Yes!” Unativi said. “Also, cousin will do the hard work. He is better.”\n“You have skill,” Ua’pam said.\n“You have more.” Unativi shook his head. “Skill I need. Instead you go\nchasing humans. Losing your mind. Going to fight?”\n“Odium comes,” Ua’pam said, softly. “Odium will come here. We must\nfight.”\n“We can run.”\n“We cannot.”\nThe two stared at one another, and Shallan took some mental notes to\nadd to her natural history. Too often humans—even some spren—regarded\nall spren as basically the same in personality and temperament. That was\nwrong. They might not be as fractured as the many nations of men, but they\nwere not a monoculture."

The book you want to write is exciting, but\nwe should make some progress on the spy today before getting distracted\nagain.\nEach of the three Lightweavers was suspicious in their own way, Beryl\nmost so currently. That said, Ishnah had worked with actual thieves in the\npast, and she was the only agent who had come to Shallan instead of\nneeding to be recruited. Ishnah had wiggled her way into being Shallan’s\nright-hand woman, and was the most skilled member of her Unseen Court.\nThe most damning fact was Ishnah’s previous fascination with the\nGhostbloods. Thinking of her as a traitor made Shallan’s insides squirm, but\nshe forced herself to confront the problem, Radiant cheering her on.\nShallan joined Ishnah as the two peakspren returned to their work. “You\nlook overwhelmed,” Shallan noted to Ishnah. “Are you well?”\n“I’ve seen into this place, Brightness.…” Ishnah closed her notebook and\nlooked across the rolling beads. “When I Soulcast, it’s there. I see the souls\nof objects, hear their thoughts. I’ve dreamed of this world, but being here is\ndifferent. Do you ever … feel something? Below, in the ocean?”\n“Yes,” Shallan admitted. She leaned against the railing. Ishnah mimicked\nher posture.\nNow, Veil said. Try steering the conversation in a way that implies you\nknow something secret, something she should be ashamed about.\nSteering conversations was, fortunately, comfortable for Shallan. She\nwas good with words. Better than Veil in many cases.\n“There are currents to this world, Ishnah,” Shallan said. “They move\nunseen. They can tow you under suddenly, abruptly, when you thought you\nwere swimming along perfectly safe.”\n“I’m … not sure what you mean by that, Brightness.”\n“I think you do.”\nIshnah immediately glanced away.\nAha! Veil thought. We’re on to something already.\nToo easy, Radiant thought. Don’t judge so quickly.\n“We all lie, Ishnah,” Shallan continued. “Especially to ourselves. It’s part\nof what makes us Lightweavers. The purpose of the Ideals, however, is to\nmake us learn to live for truth. We have to be something better, become\nsomething better, to be worthy of our spren.”\nIshnah didn’t respond, instead staring at the ocean beads passing\nbeneath.\nGive it time, Veil suggested. Don’t be in a rush to fill the silence.\nShallan obeyed, and the silence quickly became uncomfortable. She\ncould see Ishnah shifting, not meeting her eyes. Yes, she felt guilty about\nsomething.\nNow, push.\n“Say it, Ishnah,” Shallan said. “It’s time to tell me.”\n“I … I didn’t know what they’d do with the money, Brightness,” Ishnah\nfinally said. “I didn’t mean for it … I mean, I was only trying to help.”\nMoney?

She seemed\nyounger all of a sudden, fidgeting as she spoke. She was older than Shallan,\nbut not by that much. Old enough to be seen as a full adult. Young enough\nto not believe it yet.\n“My old friends in the underground came to me,” Ishnah said. “They\nwere hard up, you know? We acted so tough, but that’s the way you have to\nact. Pretend you’re important, pretend you’re dangerous, all while you’re\nactually scraping crem to get by.\n“So, I started giving them some of my stipend, ostensibly to help them\npull themselves up and out of that life.” She put her hand to her forehead.\n“Stormfather, I’m an idiot. Even I can hear how naive that sounds, saying it\nout loud. I should have known they just saw an opportunity in me.\nEveryone’s a mark. ‘Ishnah got a good break, eh? What about the rest of\nus?’ Of course they’d use it to set up another racket.”\nI feel embarrassed, Veil thought. How did I miss hearing about this?\n“Well,” Shallan said out loud, “I’m glad to hear that you aren’t\nintentionally funding a criminal enterprise.”\n“Maybe we can clean it up quietly? It’s not as bad as you might have\nheard. Or … well, I guess I’m not a good one to judge that. They bought up\nsome gambling dens, started a protection scheme in one of the lower-end\nmarkets. My money bought them some enforcers, and … I know they\nstarted using my name as proof they had authority.” She sighed. “How\nmuch does the queen know?”\n“I’m honestly not sure,” Shallan said. “I haven’t told her.”\n“If it means anything, I cut them off last month, once I learned what they\nwere doing.”\nLet’s push a little harder, Veil decided. Mention Mraize, imply he was\ninvolved. See if she lets anything slip.\n“When did Mraize get involved?” Shallan asked.\nIshnah cocked her head, scrunching up her brow. “Who?”\n“The Ghostbloods, Ishnah.”\nThe shorter woman grew pale, and her hand genuinely seemed to be\ntrembling as she put it back on the railing. “Stormfather! Did I … Did\nthey…”\n“They’ve contacted you, I know.”\n“If they have, I didn’t know it was them!” Ishnah said, shaken. She\nslumped against the railing. “What happened? Was it that man that Den\nthreatened? Was he … Storms, Brightness. I’ve made a mess of this.”\nShallan remained in place, hands clasped, trying to determine if it was an\nact.

Shallan settled down and put her freehand on Ishnah’s shoulder,\nashamed at having caused such pain in her friend.\nThat is a silly emotion, Veil thought. If Ishnah wants out, we’ve done her\na favor by exposing this.\nAnd how would we feel? Shallan asked. If someone forced us to expose\nall our flaws, all our lies, and hung them in the open like an unfinished\npainting?\n“We’ll deal with this when we return, Ishnah,” Shallan said. “And I\npromise, I will help you clear it up. You’ve made a misstep, but we all make\nthose as we seek our truths. You do belong in the light.

For not giving up on me completely,\nI mean.”\nWell done, Veil thought. Let’s slip in a tidbit that might get fed to Mraize,\nif she reports to him.\nI sincerely doubt she’s the spy, Veil, Radiant said. You yourself indicated\nshe couldn’t fool you.\nI didn’t indicate that at all, Veil said. I said if she’s the spy, she’s a better\nactor than I am. Which would make her extremely dangerous. Shallan, find\nsome bit of information to feed her that is distinct and interesting enough to\nbe worth reporting, but something she’s unlikely to talk about to the other\nmembers of the team.\nThat felt like a tall order. But Veil wasn’t willing to offer any more\nadvice, so Shallan soldiered forward.\n“Hey,” she said to Ishnah. “Just focus on helping with the mission. I like\nthat you’re taking notes on manifesting. Those will be useful.”\nShe nodded. “Is there anything else you want me to do?”\nShallan considered it, tapping her finger against the deck. “Keep your\neyes open for spren that look odd,” she said softly. “You remember Sja-\nanat?”\n“Yes,” Ishnah said. Shallan had shared about the Unmade with her and a\nfew others.\n“I think I saw a corrupted windspren flying past earlier. I can’t be certain,\nso keep it to yourself. I don’t want to alarm anyone. But if you’re going to\nbe sitting back here watching the manifesting, maybe keep an eye out? And\nif you see an odd spren, let me know. All right?”"

For your trust.”\nShallan squeezed Ishnah’s arm encouragingly, then wandered away. How\nwas that? she asked.\nNot bad, Veil said. Your warning will keep her from talking about it to\nthe other Lightweavers—but corrupted spren are also something Mraize is\ndistinctly interested in. So if she reports to him, she is likely to feed him the\ninformation. If you can find a way to tell the others you saw a different kind\nof corrupted spren, we’ll have planted just the right seed.\nI don’t think it’s going to work, Radiant said. The idea is a clever one, but\nI can’t see her reporting on such a minor detail to Mraize.\nYou’d be surprised, Veil replied. People are always eager to prove how\nimportant their mission is, and actively search for interesting things to\nreport. Keep going, Shallan. You’re doing very well.\nFeeling bolstered, she went to find Beryl. After the previous\nconversation, Ishnah now seemed the least likely to be the spy. And, Ishnah\nhad been helpful in identifying Ialai’s method of death. Besides, Mraize\nwould know she had wanted to join the Ghostbloods—and would recognize\nthat she’d draw suspicion.\nIt was probably one of the other two. And Beryl was the obvious choice.\nShallan hadn’t failed to notice the way Stargyle had dropped out of the\nmission at the last minute, with Beryl joining the team instead—a clear\nsign. But perhaps too obvious?\nBeryl was on Soulcasting duty today. Yesterday they’d stopped by a\nsmall strip of land—representing a river in the Physical Realm—and used\npickaxes to cut out some chunks of obsidian ground. Shallan had quickly\nunderstood why the spren of this realm didn’t use obsidian for anything\nother than the occasional weapon; the rock was hard to work with,\nshattering like glass when struck.\nWhile it wouldn’t make a good building material, they’d had success\nSoulcasting it into food. The stone here was eager to be something else, and\ncould easily be persuaded to change. Today, Beryl knelt beside a stone\nthey’d cut, and was practicing turning it into food.\nShallan lingered nearby, taking in Beryl’s tall Alethi figure, with luscious\ndark hair and a perfectly tan skin tone. She reminded Veil of Jasnah, only\nmore relaxed.\nShe uses Lightweaving to enhance her appearance, Veil noted. Probably\ndoes it by instinct.\nToday, Beryl wore a long skirt rather than a true havah, along with a\nsleeveless top and a pair of silk gloves that went up to her elbows. She had\nremoved her freehand glove, and now reached out with delicate, supple\nfingers to caress the chunk of obsidian. She adopted an expression of\nconcentration, and the chunk transformed to lavis grain in the blink of an\neye. The clump of lavis held the shape of the obsidian for a moment, then\ncollapsed, spreading out on the cloth underneath.\n“Brightness?” Beryl asked, glancing up from her work. She was"

She was\ndarkeyed, like many camp followers, though that didn’t really matter\nanymore. Importantly, she had not yet earned her Blade. “Am I doing\nsomething wrong?”\nBeryl had learned Lightweaving on her own away from the structure and\norder of the Radiants. She was an unknown factor, a Surgebinding savant\nwho had come with her own spren already bonded.\nShallan knelt and made a show of picking up a handful of grain and\ninspecting it. “You’re not doing anything wrong at all. This is good work.\nMost of us have trouble making individual grains.”\n“Oh! It helps to have a seed,” she said, pulling some from her pocket.\n“Literal seeds, in this case.” She grinned, holding them up. “If you have\nsomething to show the obsidian’s soul, you intrigue it enough to want to\ntransform.”\n“That’s not how Jasnah does it,” Veil said.\n“Yeah, Vathah told me. But my way works better for him too. Queen\nJasnah doesn’t know everything, right?” She smiled brightly. “Or maybe it’s\ndifferent for our order. It’s not her fault if she doesn’t know how\nLightweavers work.”\nStorms, Veil thought. I always forget how downright sunny Beryl can be.\nShallan folded her arms, thinking back to her own troubles with\nSoulcasting. Could it be that all along, the problem hadn’t been her, but\nJasnah’s training method? They’d assumed two orders using the same\npower would be analogous. The Skybreakers and the Windrunners seemed\nto fly the same way, after all.\nThen again, the way that Lightweaving worked for Truthwatchers\nseemed different—even if one disregarded whatever Renarin was. So\nmaybe?\nFocus, Veil thought. Try nudging her to be uncomfortable, find out if\nshe’s hiding something.\nShallan opened her mouth to make a comment like she had to Ishnah.\nSomething else entirely came out.\n“Are you actually happy?” Shallan asked.\n“Brightness?” Beryl asked, still sitting on a box next to some chunks of\nobsidian. “Happy?”\n“There’s a lightness about you,” Shallan said. “Is it real, or are you\nhiding the pain?”\n“I think we all hide pain to an extent,” Beryl said. “But I don’t think I’m\nin particular agony.”\n“And your past?” Shallan asked. “It doesn’t haunt you?”\n“I won’t pretend my life was easy. The profession isn’t an easy one, and\nthe women who find their way to it often have their problems magnified.\nThere are ways to keep it from chewing you up, however. To make it your\nchoice, done in your way.” She grimaced. “Or at least ways to tell yourself\nthat…”\nShallan nodded, and heard a humming behind her. Pattern—her Pattern\n—had wandered over, and was inspecting Beryl’s Soulcasting handiwork.\n“By the end,” Beryl continued, “I had a lot of control over the men who"

I liked becoming the woman they wanted. It wasn’t until you\ncame searching for me, though, that I realized the truth.” She looked\nstraight at Shallan. “That I could walk away if I wanted to. Nothing was\nkeeping me there. Not any longer. I could have left months earlier. Odd,\nisn’t it?”\n“That’s how it always is,” Veil said.\n“Pardon, Brightness, but it’s not. A lot of the women are worse off than\nme. They couldn’t simply leave; it was the moss for some, threats for\nothers. Some of us though…” She looked at her hand and let the seeds drop\ninto the pile. “We talk about transformation. The Almighty’s greatest\nblessing to humans: the ability to change. Sometimes we need a seed too,\neh?”\nShallan shuffled, looking to the side as Vathah walked by with one of the\npeakspren sailors. Maybe she should go talk to him, see if he was the spy.\nYou’re uncomfortable around Beryl, Radiant thought. Is it because she\nseems to have a greater handle on her life, when you assume she should be\nworse at it?\nFeelings, feelings, Veil said. Blah blah blah. Shallan, stay on topic,\nplease.\nShallan found her mind spiraling around her past. The things she had\ndone. The things she was still hiding from, wearing this face that she\npretended was her own. That she pretended she deserved. Shallan could be\nhappy, but that happiness was built on lies.\nWould it not be better to accept what she really was? Become the person\nshe deserved to be? Formless—who had been hiding deep inside these last\nfew days—stirred. She’d thought him forgotten, but he had been waiting.\nWatching …\n“Help,” Shallan whispered.\n“Brightness?” Beryl asked.\nRadiant stood up straight, no longer lounging. “You are to be\ncommended for your diligence, Beryl. You say that this method of\nSoulcasting has helped Vathah. Have you shown it to any of the others yet?”\n“No, not yet. I—”\n“I would like you to approach Ishnah and train her in it. Report to me the\nresults of the experiment.”\n“I will!” Beryl said. “Um, you seem different. Did you … become one of\nthe others?”\n“I have merely realized I have a great deal yet to do today,” Radiant said.\nThat caused Pattern to hum. “Continue your efforts.”\nShe moved to leave, then pretended to reconsider and stepped back,\nspeaking softly. “We need to be careful. I saw a gloryspren earlier that\nappeared odd. I think that Sja-anat, the corrupter of spren, is watching us.\nReport to me if you see any odd gloryspren, but stay very quiet about this to\nthe others. I do not wish to inspire a panic.”\nBeryl nodded.\nThat’s a little straightforward and blunt, Radiant, Veil said. The goal is\nto not act suspicious.\nI do as I can, Radiant thought. And I am not suited to subterfuge."

And I am not suited to subterfuge.\nLiar, Veil said. Shallan? Kid, you all right?\nBut Shallan had pulled into a knot within Radiant.\nIt was the conversation that set her off … Veil said. Something about it.\nAbout leaving your old life, and finding a new one?\nShallan whimpered.\nI see … Veil said, retreating as well.\nGreat. She’d lost both of them. Well, Radiant’s job was to see that things\ngot done. She walked after Vathah; Pattern stayed behind with Beryl,\nwatching her work.\nVathah was carrying a large pole that was at least thirty feet long. What\nwas he up to? Regardless, in Radiant’s estimation, Vathah was suspicious in\nan entirely different way from the other two. Vathah had always been the\nmost dark of the former deserters. And she understood why. Following\nsomething, believing in something, then abandoning it? Leaving your\ncompanions-in-arms? It was a horrifying thought.\nShe usually let the others deal with him. A lot of the other deserters she’d\ncome to understand. Gaz had run from gambling debts, and Isom from a\ncruel captain in Sadeas’s army who constantly beat him.\nBut Vathah … his true past was still a mystery. He was cruel and\npossibly corrupt; he had returned with Shallan only because the\ncircumstances had been right. Shallan liked to think she’d changed the\ndeserters—shown them the nobler side of their personalities.\nWhile she might be correct about the others, Radiant wasn’t certain\nabout Vathah. If he had deserted once, he was capable of it again. And\nstorms, he didn’t look at all like he belonged with the rest of the Court.\nEven cleaned up and wearing work clothing, Vathah looked rough. Like\nhe’d recently gotten out of bed—after collapsing into it drunk. He was\nnever properly shaved, but also never ended up with a full beard.\nVathah climbed the few steps up to the prow of the barge, the section\nwhere the mandras were harnessed. Radiant marched up after him. A female\npeakspren sailor instructed Vathah to heft the long pole so that the tip went\nhigh in the air and the bottom end slipped through a ring at the front of the\nbarge. Once he’d done so, Vathah began lowering the pole slowly, hand\nover hand. The butt of the pole passed between the mandra harness lines to\nhit the beads beneath.\nThey’re measuring depth, Radiant thought. He’s doing sailor jobs, like\nyesterday. Strange.\n“Hold it steady,” the peakspren said to Vathah. “Brace it against the prow\nof the barge. Yes. Keep going.”\nVathah continued lowering the pole. The current of the beads below was\nclearly stronger than a current of water would be, and it pressed the pole\nbackward. The rings on the front of the ship were there to keep the force of\nthe beads from pulling the pole out of his hands.\n“Keep going,” the peakspren said. “Slower though!”"

The rings on the front of the ship were there to keep the force of\nthe beads from pulling the pole out of his hands.\n“Keep going,” the peakspren said. “Slower though!”\nVathah grunted, continuing to lower the depth gauge. “They use\nweighted strings in my world.”\n“Wouldn’t work here.”\n“I just bumped something,” he said. “Yeah, that’s the bottom. Huh. Not\nas far down as I thought it would be.”\n“We’ve entered the shallows,” the peakspren said, helping him raise the\npole. “Skirting to the west of the great trench we call the Radiant Depths.”\nVathah got the pole up and walked to stow it along the railing. Then the\nspren tossed him a brush. Vathah nodded and walked toward the water\nstation. The metal device fed on Stormlight to somehow make water.\n“What is this task?” Radiant asked, following after him.\n“Deck needs to be scrubbed,” he said. “They don’t wash them here as\noften as they do on ships back home—guess they don’t need to, without\nocean water spilling up on everything. Planks don’t need tar to keep them\nwaterproof either.”\n“You were a sailor?” Radiant asked, surprised.\n“I’ve done a lot of jobs.” He filled up a bucket, then picked a section of\nthe deck and went to work, kneeling and scrubbing at the wood.\n“I’m impressed,” Radiant said. “I had not thought you would be one to\nvolunteer for work, Vathah.”\n“It needs to be done.”\n“It is good to work the body, but I find myself objecting to that\nstatement. The peakspren seem to have continued for a while without the\ndeck being washed.” She folded her arms, then shrugged and moved to get\na brush herself.\nAs she returned, Vathah glanced at her with a dark expression. “Did you\nsimply come to taunt me, Radiant? Or is there a point?”\n“I suppose it’s easy to tell me apart from the others, isn’t it?”\n“Veil would never have decided to help,” he said, continuing to brush.\n“She’d have mocked me for doing extra work. Shallan would be off\nsomewhere drawing or reading. So, here we are.”\n“Indeed,” Radiant said, kneeling and scrubbing alongside him. “You are\nan observant man, Vathah.”\n“Observant enough to know you want something from me. What is it?”\n“I’m merely curious,” she said. “The Vathah I know would have avoided\nwork and found a place to relax.”\n“Relaxing isn’t relaxing,” he said. “Sit around too much, and you start\nsitting around even more.” He kept brushing. “Go across the planks, rather\nthan up and down them, so you don’t wear grooves. Yeah, like that. This\ndoes need to be done. The sailors used to scrub the wood every month, but\nthey haven’t had as much help lately. Something about Reachers not being\naround? What are Reachers, anyway?”\n“They’re a specific bronze-skinned kind of spren,” Radiant said. “They\nwere sailors on our previous voyage.”\n“Well, they aren’t around as much to hire these days, I guess,” Vathah\nsaid."

Now, how could she get to the topic of a\ncorrupted spren? She considered, and began to regard this as a silly\nexercise. Why not ask him if he was the spy. If she was firm enough, he’d\nadmit to his wrongdoing.\nShe opened her mouth to do just that, but had enough common sense to\nstop herself. This was … not a good idea, was it? Having her do espionage?\nNo, Shallan thought, emerging with a sigh. I guess it isn’t.\n“Hey,” Shallan said to Vathah as they scrubbed. “You know we’re a\nfamily, right? The Court, the group of us? You don’t have to always go off\nalone and punish yourself.”\n“Not punishing myself,” he growled. “Just wanted to be busy. And away\nfrom questions. Everyone asks too many questions when they get bored.”\n“You don’t have to answer them,” she said. “Really, Vathah. You’re one\nof us, and we accept you. As you are.”\nHe glanced at her, then sat back on his knees, dripping brush in hand.\nShallan did likewise, noting that she’d scuffed her trousers. Radiant was\nalways too eager to throw herself into labor, never worrying about her\nclothing.\n“Shallan,” he said.\nShe nodded.\nVathah returned to his work and didn’t speak as he continued to scrub.\nUnlike Ishnah, he was perfectly willing to let silence hang. It was harder for\nShallan, but she did. For a time the only sound was that of bristles on wood.\n“Does it work?” Vathah finally asked. “These three faces you put on?\nDoes it actually help you somehow?”\n“It does,” Shallan said. “It really does. Most of the time, at least.”\n“Can’t decide if I envy you or not,” Vathah replied. “I’d like to be able to\npretend. Something broke in me, you know? A long time ago. Used to be a\ngood soldier. Used to care. But then you see what you’ve done—\nlegitimately see it—and realize everything you fought for was a sham. What\ndo polished buttons matter when you’ve got a child’s blood on your boots?”\nHe scrubbed harder at a spot on the deck. “Figure if I learn to Lightweave\nwell enough, maybe I’ll turn into someone else…”\nThat stabbed her straight through.\nStrength, Shallan, Radiant thought. Strength before weakness.\n“Wouldn’t that be a blessing?” Vathah continued. “To become someone\nelse? Someone new?”\n“You can do that without Lightweaving,” Shallan said.\n“Can I?” Vathah asked. “Can you?”\n“I…”\n“We’ve got a blessing in this power,” he continued. “Lets us turn into\nother people.”\n“It’s not a blessing,” Shallan whispered. “It’s survival.”\n“Feels worse in this place,” Vathah said, eyeing the sky. “I always feel"

One of those fearspren, the long eel-like\nones on this side.”\n“What color was it?” Vathah asked. “Was it … hers?”\n“Yeah,” Shallan whispered. “I didn’t tell the others. Didn’t want them\nworried.”\n“Smart,” Vathah said. “Well, Sja-anat is something else for me to worry\nabout. I’ll have to double-check every storming spren now.”\n“Let me know if you see anything,” Shallan said. “But don’t trouble the\nothers, not yet. Not until we know for certain what she wants.”\nVathah nodded.\nNice work, Veil thought at her, emerging from her contemplation. That\nwas smooth, Shallan. We’ll think of ways to push him for secrets he might\nbe hiding later. For now, this was a good day’s work.\nI hate that I’m back to acting like an apprentice, Shallan thought back.\nYou learned all this from Tyn. Why do we need to learn it again?\nWe learned it, Veil thought, but we never tried it out. Remember, we …\nare new to this, despite what we might … might pretend.\nIt was hard for Veil to acknowledge that she didn’t actually have years of\nexperience. Hard for her to admit that she was an alter—a part of Shallan’s\npersonality, manifesting as a distinct person. But it was a good reminder.\nOne that Radiant often brought up. They were learning, and they weren’t\nexperts. Not yet.\nStill, Shallan did know a few things about people. Though Veil wanted to\nmove on, Shallan knelt beside Vathah. “Hey,” she said. “Whatever you did,\nit’s behind you. We accept you, Vathah. The Unseen Court is a family.”\n“A family,” he said with a grunt. “Never had one of those before.”\n“I knew it,” she said softly.\n“What? That I was lonely?”\n“No,” she said solemnly, “that you were the child of a couple of\nparticularly ugly rocks.”\nHe glared at her.\n“You know,” she said, “since you have no family. Must be rocks. It\nmakes sense.”\n“Really? We were having a moment.”\nShe smiled, putting her hand on his shoulder. “It’s okay, Vathah. I\nappreciate your sediment.” She got up to go.\n“Hey,” Vathah said as she walked away.\nShe glanced back at him.\n“Thanks for smiling.”\nShe nodded before continuing on her way.\nWhat you said applies to us too, Radiant thought. That what we did in\nthe past doesn’t matter.\nI suppose, Shallan thought.\nYou don’t mean that, Veil accused her.

And\nno amount of prodding would bring Shallan back.\nThat said, the most worrying thing I discovered in this was the wound\nupon the Spiritual Realm where Ambition, Mercy, and Odium clashed\n—and Ambition was destroyed. The effects on the planet Threnody\nhave been … disturbing.\nNavani had always found war banners to be curious things. The wind was\ncrisp and cold on Urithiru’s outer platform today, and it made the banners—\nbrilliant Kholin blue, with Dalinar’s glyphpair emblazoned on them—crack\nwith the sound of breaking sticks. They seemed alive up there on their\npoles, writhing like captive skyeels among the windspren.\nToday, the banners waved above waiting battalions. A thousand men at a\ntime stood for their turn at the Oathgate, where Radiants transferred them to\nAzir. With a flash—a ring of light rising around the plateau—both men and\nbanners were off, sent hundreds of miles in a heartbeat.\nNavani appreciated the aesthetic nature of banners—the way they\nmarked divisions, battalions, companies. At the same time, there was a\nstrange incongruity to them. It was essential to keep your men organized\nand engaged on the battlefield. Dalinar said far more battles were lost by\nimproper discipline than by lack of bravery.\nBut the banners also acted like enormous arrows, pointing the way to the\nmost important men on the field. Banners were targets. Bold proclamations\nthat here was where you’d find someone to kill. They were symbols of an\norganized army, helmed by men and women who knew the best way to end\nyou—if only you’d do them the favor of wandering in their direction.\n“You look preoccupied,” Dalinar said as he stepped over, trailed by an\nhonor guard of ten men.\n“I’m thinking about symbols and why we use them,” Navani said.\n“Trying not to think about you leaving again.”\nHe reached down to cup her cheek. Who had known those hands could\nbe so tender? She placed her hand alongside his face. His skin always felt\nrough. She swore she’d touched his cheek right after he’d shaved, and still\nfound it ragged like sandpaper.\nThe honor guard stood tall and tried to ignore Dalinar and Navani. Even\nthis little sign of affection wasn’t particularly Alethi. That was what they\ntold themselves, anyway. The stoic warriors. Not ruined by emotion. That\nwas their banner, never mind that for centuries one of the Unmade had\ndriven their lust for battle to a frenzy. Never mind that they were human\nlike any others. They had emotions; they displayed them. They merely\npretended to ignore them. In the same way you might tactfully ignore a man\nwho accidentally went about with his trousers undone.\n“Watch him, Dalinar,” Navani whispered. “He will try something.”"

Taravangian was walking up the slope onto the\nplatform for the next transfer. Through some careful finagling, his honor\nguard was Alethi—and Dalinar planned to station the man’s armies away\nfrom the command post on another part of the Azish front, with extra\nsoldiers in between to protect his flank from a potential double cross.\nIt was an unfortunately obvious move. Taravangian would realize he was\nbeing kept hostage, after a fashion, to ensure the loyalty of his troops.\nAs an extra protection, a singular secret weapon hid among Dalinar’s\nservants. Szeth, wearing the face of a common soldier, had been assigned to\nguard Dalinar. Navani couldn’t spot him, so the disguise—maintained by\none of Shallan’s Lightweavers—was working. Though the sheath to his\nstrange sword had required some physical decorations and disguises, as a\nLightweaving wouldn’t stick to it. So she thought she could pick him out as\nthe one with the oversized weapon at his waist.\nAnother Lightweaver had created an illusion of Szeth in his jail cell. If\nTaravangian had people reporting on Szeth, they’d indicate he was safely\nlocked up. They wouldn’t know he was instead staying very close to\nDalinar. Though she hated the idea, Navani had to admit that Szeth had\nremained in prison all these months, without a single incident. He seemed\nobedient to Dalinar without question. And if Szeth could be trusted, there\nwas likely no better guard.\nAlmighty send that the cure was not worse than the disease. Beyond that,\nNavani couldn’t help wondering if even in all this, they were being\nmanipulated by Taravangian. Surely he couldn’t want them to surround him\nwith enemy troops. Surely she misread the clever turn of the old man’s lips,\nthe knowing look in his eyes.\nBut now it was time for Dalinar to leave. So, Navani carefully tucked\naway her anxiety and embraced him. He plainly wasn’t thrilled to get a hug\nin front of his soldiers, but he didn’t say anything. After that, the two of\nthem went to meet the governess who had brought little Gav, with his\ntrunks of things. The young boy—trying hard not to look too eager—\nsaluted Dalinar.\n“It is a big duty,” Dalinar told him, “going to war for the first time. Are\nyou ready?”\n“I am, sir!” the child said. “I’ll fight well!”\n“You won’t be fighting,” Dalinar said. “And neither will I. We’ll be\nhandling strategy.”\n“I’m good at that!” Gav said. Then he gave Navani a hug.\nThe governess led him toward the Oathgate building. Navani watched\nwith worry. “He’s young to be going.”\n“I know,” Dalinar said. “But I owe him this.

And he really did deserve more time with Dalinar.\nShe held his hand for a season, then let him go. He tramped up the slope\ntoward the Oathgate as a half dozen anxious scribes scurried over to ask\nhim questions.\nNavani composed herself, then went to say farewell to her daughter, who\nwould also be going on the expeditionary force. She spotted the queen\narriving via palanquin. Curiously, Jasnah—who often took extra care not to\nseem weak—almost always used a palanquin these days. And Taravangian,\nwho truly needed one, refused the distinctive treatment.\nTaravangian seemed weaker while walking—while Jasnah seemed\nstronger when carried. More confident, in control. Which is exactly how\neach of them wishes to appear, Navani thought as the porters lowered\nJasnah’s palanquin and she emerged. Though her havah, her hair, and her\nmakeup were immaculate, Jasnah wore little in the way of ornamentation.\nShe wanted to be seen as regal—but not excessive.\n“No Wit?” Navani asked.\n“He promised to meet me in Azir,” Jasnah said. “He vanishes sometimes,\nand won’t grace my questions with answers. Not even mocking ones.”\n“There is something odd about that one, Jasnah.”\n“You have no idea, Mother.”\nThe two of them stood facing one another, until finally Jasnah reached\nforward. What followed was the most awkward hug Navani had ever been\npart of, both of them making the proper motions, but unenthusiastic at the\nsame time.\nJasnah pulled back. She was regal. Technically they were both of a\nsimilar rank, yet there had always been something about Jasnah. Dalinar\nwas a big rock of a man that you wanted to prod until you found out what\nkind of crystals were inside. Jasnah … well, Jasnah was just …\nunknowable.\n“Storms,” Jasnah said under her breath. “Mother, are we really so\nawkward that we embrace like teenagers meeting a boy for the first time?”\n“I don’t want to ruin your image,” Navani said.\n“A woman can hug her mother, can’t she? My reputation won’t come\ncrashing down because I showed affection.” Still, she didn’t lean in for\nanother. Instead she took Navani’s hand. “I apologize. I haven’t had much\ntime for family lately. I always told myself that when I finished my travels,\nI’d work diligently to be available to you all. I recognize that family\nrelations need attendant time to…” Jasnah took a deep breath, then pressed\nher safehand against her forehead. “I sound like a historical treatise, not a\nperson, don’t I?”\n“You have a lot of pressure on you, dear,” Navani said.\n“Pressure that I asked for and welcome,” Jasnah said. “The quickest\nchanges in history often happen during times of strife, and these are\nimportant moments. But you’re important too. To me. Thank you. For"

But you’re important too. To me. Thank you. For\nalways being you, despite the rise of kingdoms and the fall of peoples. I\ndon’t think you can understand how much your constant strength means to\nme.”\nWhat an unusual exchange. Yet Navani found herself smiling. She\nsqueezed Jasnah’s hand, and that moment together—seeing through the\nmask—became more precious than a hundred awkward embraces.\n“Watch little Gav for me,” Navani said. “I don’t know what I think of\nhim going with Dalinar.”\n“Boys younger than him go on campaign.”\n“To locations not so near the battlefront,” Navani said. It was a fine\ndistinction that many of their allies misunderstood. But these days, with\nFused who could fly, anywhere could become a battlefront.\n“I’ll make sure he keeps well away from the fighting,” Jasnah promised.\nNavani nodded. “Your uncle feels that he failed Adolin and Renarin as\nchildren by spending so long in the field, and so little of it with them when\nthey were young. He intends to make up for it now. I don’t dislike the\nsentiment, but … just keep an eye on them both for me, please.”\nJasnah retreated to her palanquin, and Navani stepped back. The banners\ncontinued to applaud as Dalinar’s best soldiers arranged themselves with\nhim, the queen, and Taravangian. Though the chill air sliced through her\nshawl, Navani was determined to stay and watch until she had word via\nspanreed that they’d arrived in Azir.\nAs she waited, Sebarial wandered past. The portly, bearded man had\ntaken to wearing clothing that was more appropriate to his overall look:\nsomething reminiscent of a Thaylen merchant’s clothing, with trousers and\na vest under a long Alethi officer’s coat, meant to be left unbuttoned.\nNavani wasn’t certain if Palona was to credit for the transformation, or if\nAdolin had finally gotten to the highprince—but it was a marked\nimprovement on the takama ensemble Sebarial had once favored.\nMost of the highprinces were out in the field on Dalinar’s orders. It was\nAlethi tradition: being a leader was essentially the same as being a general.\nIf a king went to war, highprinces would go with him. That was so\ningrained in them that it was hard to remember that other cultures—like\nboth the Azish and the Thaylens—did it differently.\nNot many of the original highprinces remained. They’d been forced to\nreplace Vamah, Thanadal, and—most recently—Sadeas with distant scions\nloyal to Dalinar and Jasnah. But building a reputation and a princedom in\nexile was a difficult task. Roion’s son struggled for precisely that reason.\nThey had three they could count on. Aladar, Sebarial, and Hatham.\nBethab and his wife had fallen into line, which left Ruthar the lone holdout\nof hostility—the last remnant of Sadeas’s faction against Dalinar. Navani\npicked out the man with his retinue preparing to leave with Dalinar’s force."

Navani\npicked out the man with his retinue preparing to leave with Dalinar’s force.\nRuthar would present a problem, but if Navani were to guess, Jasnah\nwould find a way to deal with him soon. Her daughter hated loose ends.\nHopefully whatever Jasnah did wouldn’t be too dramatic.\nSebarial was staying behind to help administer the tower. And he offered\nhis own set of difficulties. “So,” he said to Navani. “We taking bets on how\nlong it takes Taravangian to knife us in the back?”\n“Hush,” Navani said.\n“Thing is,” Sebarial said, “I kind of respect the old goof. If I manage to\nlive as long as him, I can imagine throwing up my hands and trying to take\nover the world. I mean … at that point, what do you have to lose?”\n“Your integrity.”\n“Integrity doesn’t stop men from killing, Brightness,” Sebarial said. “It\njust makes them use different justifications.”\n“Glib, but meaningless,” Navani said. “Do you really want to draw a\nmoral equivalency between wholesale conquest and resisting the\nVoidbringer invasion? Do you genuinely believe that a man of integrity is\nthe same as a murderer?”\nHe chuckled. “You have me there, Brightness. You seem to have\ndiscovered my one great weakness: actually listening to anything I say. You\nmight be the only person in all of Roshar who takes me seriously.”\nLight rose in a ring around the Oathgate platform, swirling into the air. A\nscribe stood nearby at her workstation, waiting for spanreed confirmation of\nthe army’s arrival.\n“I’m not the only one who takes you seriously, Turinad,” Navani told\nSebarial. “There’s at least one more.”\n“If she took me seriously, Brightness, I’d be a married man.” He sighed.\n“I can’t decide if she thinks me unworthy of her, or if somehow she’s\ndecided a highprince shouldn’t marry someone of her station. When I try to\nget it out of her, the response is never clear.”\n“Could be neither option,” Navani said.\n“If that’s the case, I’m at a complete loss.”\nThe scribe changed the flag outside her workstation. Green for a\nsuccessful transfer, with a red flag underneath, meaning people were still\nleaving the other platform and it wasn’t ready for another transfer yet.\nAnother use for banners, Navani thought. They could at times be more\neffective than a spanreed. You could look down from the twentieth floor and\nsee a flag much more quickly than you could write out a question and\nreceive a response.\nReputations were banners also. Jasnah had crafted a distinctive persona.\nPeople halfway around the world knew about her. Dalinar had done the\nsame thing. Not as deliberately, but with equal effect.\nBut what banner did Navani want to fly? She turned with Sebarial and\nwalked toward the tower. She’d originally come to the Shattered Plains to\nchase something new. A different life, one that she wanted rather than one\nshe thought she should want. Yet here she found herself doing the same\nthings as before. Running a kingdom for a man who was too grand to be\ncontained by simple day-to-day tasks."

Running a kingdom for a man who was too grand to be\ncontained by simple day-to-day tasks.\nThe love she felt for this man was different, true. Deeper. And there was\ncertainly a fulfilling satisfaction to bringing order to the chaos of a newly\nborn kingdom like Urithiru. It presented unique challenges both logistical\nand political.\nWas it selfish to want something more? This was what she seemed to be\ngood at doing, and it was where the Almighty had placed her. She was one\nof the most powerful women in the world. Why would she think she\ndeserved more?\nTogether with Sebarial, she entered the tower by its broad front gates.\nThe temperature change was immediate, though with these broad gates\nstanding open all day, the inner foyer should have been as cold as the\nplateau outside.\n“You want me to return to the warcamps, I assume?” Sebarial asked. “I\nstill have some interests working in the area.”\n“Yes. By the time my husband returns, I want those camps fully under\nour control again.”\n“You know,” Sebarial said, “some wouldn’t trust me with such a duty.\nMy vices align well with the delights offered by the region.”\n“We’ll see. Of course, if you fail to bring order to the warcamps, then I’ll\nneed to impose martial law. Tragic, wouldn’t you say? Closing down all of\nthose entrepreneurs? Destroying the single place that is under Alethi rule,\nbut which also offers an escape from the strict oversight of the Radiants?\n“If only someone with precisely the right mindset would watch the\nwarcamps and make sure they become safe for travelers, and that the nearby\nlumber operations are proceeding without interruption. Someone who could\nsee the need for law, while also understanding that it’s not a terrible thing to\nbe a little more relaxed. To let good Alethi citizens live their lives safely—\nbut without being under my husband’s direct glare.”\nSebarial laughed. “How much do you suppose I can pocket before\nDalinar would find my thieving too blatant?”\n“Stay under five percent,” Navani said.\n“Four and nine-tenths it is,” Sebarial said, bowing to her. “I’ll be\npractically respectable, Brightness. Perhaps Palona will finally see that I\ncan be useful, if given the proper motivation.”\n“Turi?” Navani said.\n“Yes, Brightness?” he asked, rising from the flowery bow.\n“If a man takes nothing in his life seriously, it makes a woman wonder.\nWhat is she? Another joke? Another whim?”\n“Surely she knows her value to me, Brightness.”\n“Surely there is no problem in making it clear.” Navani patted him on the\narm. “It is difficult not to question your value to someone who seems to\nvalue nothing. Sincerity might not come easily for you, but when she finds\nit in you, she’ll value it even more for the scarcity.”\n“Yes … All right.

But he’d\nstood with them, whether through intent or accident, when most others had\nrefused. Beyond that, she’d found he could be trusted to get things done.\nLike everyone, deep down he wanted to be useful. Humans were orderly\nbeings. They liked to see lots of straight lines, if only so—in some cases—\nthey could be the one drawing curves. And if a tool seemed broken at first\nglance, perhaps you were simply applying it to the wrong task.\nOnce in the tower, Navani took a palanquin inward, attended by\nBrightness Anesa, who brought various reports for Navani to inspect.\nNavani passed over the sanitation figures, instead reading up on water\ndistribution through the tower, as well as reports of foot traffic in the\nstairwells.\nThere were more random fights and arguments in Urithiru than there had\nbeen in Dalinar’s warcamp. Part of that was the diverse population, but she\nsuspected that keeping everyone in relatively tight confines was a culprit as\nwell. Dalinar wanted to post more guard patrols, but if she could divert\ntraffic flow to keep people from jostling one another …\nShe had some ideas mapped out by the time her palanquin reached the\natrium at the far eastern edge of the tower. She stepped out into one of the\ncity’s most dynamic locations: a place where a vast corridor stretched tens\nand tens of floors upward, almost to the roof. While lifts ran up and down\nthe large artery that led inward to the atrium—and there were a multitude\nmore stairwells—this was the sole place one could catch a lift all the way to\nthe top floor.\nStretching along the eastern wall was an enormous window, hundreds of\nfeet tall. The tiers of Urithiru weren’t full circles—most were closer to half-\ncircles, with the flat side aligned here at the atrium. So you could look all\nthe way up, or stare out toward the Origin.\nAs one of the brighter sections of the tower, and with its many lifts, the\narea bustled with traffic. That made it all the more remarkable that the\natrium—of all places—had hidden an architectural mystery. Navani crossed\nthe circular chamber to the far wall, just to the left side of the window. A\nfew days back, one of her scribes had noted an oddity here: a small division\nin the rock, too straight to be a crack.\nWith Dalinar’s permission, a Stoneward had been called in to shape the\nrock into an opening—they could make stone soft to their touch. Navani’s\nmorning report had indicated she should come see the results, but this was\nthe first time she’d been able to pull away. Badali, a Stoneward, guarded the\ndoor. He was an affable older man with a powdery beard and smiling eyes.\nHe bowed to her as she stepped through his newly made door.\nFalilar, the engineer, was already inside measuring what they’d\ndiscovered: a large room hidden entirely in the stone.\n“Brightness,” Brightness Anesa said, walking alongside her. “What was\nthe purpose of sealing off an entire room like this?”\nNavani shook her head.

        "text": "“Brightness,” Brightness Anesa said, walking alongside her. “What was\nthe purpose of sealing off an entire room like this?”\nNavani shook her head. This wasn’t the only room they’d found in the\ntower with apparently no entrances. This one was particularly significant\nthough, for it had a large picture window along the rear wall, which let in\nthe sunlight.\nStanding in front of that window was an odd structure: a tall stone model\nof the tower. She’d read about it in the report, but as she approached, she\nwas still surprised by its intricacy. The thing was a good fifteen feet tall, and\nwas divided in two—the halves pulled apart—to give a cross section of the\ntower. At this scale, floors weren’t even an inch tall, but everything she saw\nabout them was reproduced in intricate detail. At least, as much as was\nallowed at that scale.\nFalilar joined her beside it, holding a notebook full of figures. “What do\nyou make of it, Brightness?”\n“I have no idea,” she said. “Why put this here, but then seal it off?” She\nbent over, noting that the crystal pillar room—along with the two library\nrooms nearby—was represented in the model.\nFalilar used a small reed to point. “See here? This room itself is\nreproduced, with a tiny representation of this very model. But there is an\nopen door leading in, where there wasn’t one in the real tower.”\n“So the rooms were sealed off before the Radiants left?”\n“Or,” Falilar said, “they could open and close some other way. When the\ntower was abandoned, some were already closed, others open.”\n“That would explain a lot.” They’d found so many rooms with actual\ndoors—or, the remnants of ones rotted away—that she hadn’t considered\nthat there might be other mechanisms on undiscovered rooms. A clearly\nbiased approach. She glanced at the wall they’d come in through. “Did that\nStoneward discover any mechanism for such an opening?”\n“There was a gemstone embedded in the stone,” Falilar said. “I had him\nget it out for us to inspect. I intend to have him see if perhaps the rock was\nsomehow intended to slide open to the sides there. If so, it would be a\nremarkable mechanism.”\nNavani made a mental note to have one of the Windrunners fly out to do\na close inspection of the mountains that Urithiru was built into. Perhaps\nwindows like this one would reveal other hidden rooms, with equally\nmysterious contents.\n“I’ll do a thorough inspection of this model,” Falilar said. “It might yield\nsecrets.”\n“Thank you. I, unfortunately, have some sanitation reports to read.”\n“If you get a chance, stop by the library and talk to my nephew,” Falilar\nsaid. “He’s made some improvements on his device.”\nNavani nodded and started back toward her palanquin, trusting Falilar to\nsend her whatever he discovered. As she was climbing into the palanquin,\nshe saw Isabi—one of her younger scholars—rush into the room, holding a\nblinking red light.\nThe mysterious spanreed. The one she’d received weeks ago from the\nunknown person who was so angry about fabrials. It was the first time they\nhad tried to contact her since that day.\nSanitation reports would wait."

It was the first time they\nhad tried to contact her since that day.\nSanitation reports would wait.\nOther Shards I cannot identify, and are hidden to me. I fear that their\ninfluence encroaches upon my world, yet I am locked into a strange\ninability because of the opposed powers I hold.\n“Hold it steady!” Falilar said. It had been years since Navani had seen the\nold white-bearded engineer this animated. “Put it here on the table. Isabi,\nyou have the scale, yes? Hurry, hurry. Set it up like we practiced!”\nThe small swarm of ardents and scholars fussed around Navani, settling\nthe spanreed into its board and preparing standard violet ink. They’d carried\nit out and set it up in a guard post near the perimeter of the tower. Kalami\nstood next to Navani, her arms folded. Hair streaked with grey, the scribe\nhad an increasingly worrisome leanness to her these days.\n“I’m not sure about this, Brightness,” she said as the engineer and his\nassistants set up their instruments. “I worry that whoever is on the other\nside of that spanreed, they’ll learn more about us than we do about them.”\nFalilar wiped his shaved head with a handkerchief, then gestured for\nNavani to sit at the table.\n“Noted,” Navani said to Kalami, settling down. “We ready?”\n“Yes, Brightness,” Falilar said. “Judging by the weight of your pen once\nthe conversation is engaged, we should be able to tell how far away the\nother pen is.”\nSpanreeds had a certain decay to them. The farther apart they were, the\nheavier the pens became after activation. In most cases, this was a slight—\nalmost imperceptible—difference. Today, the spanreed board, with pen\nattached, had been placed on Falilar’s most precise scale. The pen was\nhooked by strings to other instruments as well. Navani carefully turned the\nruby, indicating she was ready to communicate with her phantom\ncorrespondent. The six scholars and ardents, Kalami included, seemed to\nhold their collective breath.\nThe pen started writing. Why have you ignored my instructions?\nFalilar gestured animatedly to the others, who began taking\nmeasurements—adding tiny weights to the balance and reading the tension\nin the pull of the string.\nShe left them to their measurements, instead focusing on the\nconversation. I’m not sure what exactly you expected of me, she wrote.\nPlease, explain further.\nYou must stop your experiments with fabrials, the reed wrote. I made it\nexplicitly clear that you needed to stop. You have not. You have only\nincreased your heresies. What is this you do, putting fabrials in a pit and\nconnecting them to the blowing of the storms? Do you make a weapon of\nthe spren you have trapped? Do you kill? Humans always kill.\n“Heresies?” Kalami noted as the engineers worked. “Whoever it is\nseems to have a theological opposition to our actions.”\n“She references humans as a singer might,” Navani said, tapping the\npaper. “Either she’s one of them, or she wants us to think she is.”"

The decay is almost\nnonexistent.”\n“So they’re near to us,” Navani said.\n“Extremely near,” Falilar said. “Inside the tower. If we could figure out a\nway to make more precise scales … Regardless, a second measurement\nwould help me with possible triangulation.”\nNavani nodded. Why do you call this a heresy? Navani wrote. The\nchurch sees no moral problem with fabrials. No more than they have a\nproblem with hitching a chull to a cart.\nA chull hitched to a cart is not confined to a tiny space, the reply came,\nthe pen moving furiously, animatedly. Spren are meant to be free. By\ncapturing them, you trap nature itself. Can a storm survive if placed in a\nprison? Can a flower bloom with no sunlight? This is what you do. Your\nreligion is incomplete.\nLet me think on this, Navani wrote. I will need a few minutes to speak\nwith my theological advisor.\nEach moment you wait is a moment of pain brought to the spren you\ndominate, the pen wrote. I will not suffer it for much longer.\nPlease wait, Navani wrote. I will use another spanreed for a moment, to\ntalk to my theological advisor, but then will respond to you soon.\nNo response came, but the pen continued to hover—the phantom was\nwaiting.\n“All right,” she said. “Let’s get the second measurement.”\nThe engineers moved with a flurry of activity, disjoining the spanreed so\nthe link between the two pens was temporarily broken. They gathered the\nequipment and started running.\nNavani and Kalami hurried into the palanquin waiting for them outside\nthe room. A group of six men hefted it and charged after the engineers and\nscribes as the entire group rushed through the tower. They eventually burst\nout onto the plateau in front of Urithiru. You couldn’t tell the direction of a\nsecond spanreed, not directly, even from the decay.\nHowever, because you could measure the decay—and therefore judge\ndistance—you could triangulate from multiple measurements and get a\nrough idea of location. The team set up out here, on the plateau, among the\ncoldspren.\nBy the time she climbed free of the palanquin, Falilar and his team had\nthe spanreed ready on the stone ground. Navani knelt and reengaged the\ndevice.\nThey waited, Falilar dabbing at his head with his handkerchief, Kalami\nkneeling beside the paper and whispering, “Come on.” Falilar’s little\napprentice—Isabi, daughter to one of the Windrunners—seemed ready to\nburst as she held her breath.\nThe pen engaged, then wrote, Why did you move? What are you doing?\nI have spoken to my ardents, Navani wrote as the engineers again began\ntaking measurements. They agree that our knowledge must be flawed. Can\nyou explain how you know that this is evil? How is it you know what our\nardents do not?\n“How does she know we moved?” Kalami asked."

You interrupted me on my way to an\nimportant meeting. I have a few more minutes now to talk. Please. Tell us\nhow you know what we don’t.\nThe truth is evident to me, the pen wrote.\nIt is not obvious to us, Navani wrote.\nBecause you are human, it replied. Humans cannot be trusted. You do\nnot know how to keep promises, and promises are what make the world\nfunction. We make the world function. You must release your captive spren.\nYou must you must.\n“Ash’s mask…” Kalami said. “It’s a spren, isn’t it?”\n“Yes,” Navani said.\n“I have measurements,” Falilar said. “It is coming from the tower. I\nshould be able to pin it down to a specific region. I must say, Brightness,\nyou don’t seem surprised by any of this.”\n“I had my suspicions,” Navani said. “We found one ancient spren hiding\nin the tower. Is it such a stretch to assume a second has done the same?”\n“Another of the Unmade?” Kalami asked.\nNavani tapped her finger against the spanreed paper, thinking. “I doubt\nit,” she said. “A spren who wishes to free its kind? A liberationspren? Has\nanyone heard of such a thing?”\nThe scholars collectively shook their heads. Navani reached to write\nfurther to the phantom, but the spanreed shut off, dropping to the paper, no\nlonger actively conjoined.\n“So … what do we do?” Kalami asked. “Another of those things could\nbe watching us from the darkness. Planning more murders.”\n“It’s not the same,” Navani said. “There’s something here.…” We make\nthe world function.\nAs they gathered up their things, a plan began budding in Navani’s mind.\nA touch reckless, particularly since she didn’t want to explain it to the\nothers where the spren might be able to hear.\nShe went ahead with the idea anyway. As they were walking to the tower\nproper, Navani stumbled and—trying to make it appear as accidental as\npossible—dropped the spanreed while walking. She cried out as she\nclumsily kicked it across the stone plateau—right over the edge. She rushed\nover, but it had already vanished, tumbling to the rocks thousands of feet\nbelow.\n“The spanreed!” Falilar said. “Oh, Brightness!”\n“Damnation,” she said. “That’s terrible.”\nKalami eyed her, walking up. Navani smothered a smile.\n“Falilar,” Navani said. “Gather a team to see if they can recover that. I\nneed to take better care.”\n“Yes, Brightness,” he said.\nOf course if they did find it, the team would have discreet directions to\nbreak the ruby as if from the fall. And of course they would be instructed to\nspeak loudly of the tragedy of it among her scholars in the tower."

Not\nsouls, but actual candles in the windows of small structures. In Shadesmar,\nspren could manifest the beads that represented the soul of a fire—and in so\ndoing, create flames that provided light, but very little heat.\nOthers gathered at the sides of the barge, and Godeke joined Adolin on\nthe small upper deck. The lanky Edgedancer seemed as eager as Adolin to\nbe off the boat; Adolin had seen Godeke pacing more than once these last\nfew days.\nUnfortunately, the responsible side of Adolin—drilled into him over\nyears with his father—made him call for caution. “We don’t know the\nsituation in this town yet,” he said to the others. “Last time I was in\nShadesmar, the first town we entered ended up being held by the Fused. We\nshould send some of the Lightweavers in, wearing disguises, to scout.”\n“You will not find danger here,” Ua’pam promised, rubbing his knuckles\ntogether in a curious gesture, making a sound like two rocks grinding.\n“These are free lands. Neither honorspren nor Fused control this outpost.”\n“Still,” Adolin said, looking to the others. “Humans, under the tarp until\nwe’ve done some basic scouting.”\nGrumbling, they gathered their horses and moved into the large “room”\nunder the tarps. Shallan was resting here already; most of them had opted to\nplace their bedrolls here, where the tall boxes of cargo had been stacked to\nmake various nooks and cubbies.\nAdolin nudged her. “Shallan? You all right?”\nThe dark lump that was his wife stirred. “Might have had a little too\nmuch to drink last night.”"

You all right?”\nThe dark lump that was his wife stirred. “Might have had a little too\nmuch to drink last night.”\nAdolin smiled. The trip had been genuinely relaxing, save for his worry\nabout their destination. It had been good to spend time with Shallan—and\nhe had enjoyed even the appearances of Veil and Radiant. The latter made\nan excellent sparring partner, and the former knew a seemingly infinite\nnumber of card games. Some of which were good Vorin games, and\nothers … well, they had too much randomness for propriety, but were more\nfun than Adolin had expected.\nIt had culminated with Shallan pulling out an excellent Thaylen violet,\nKdisln vintage, last night. As usual, she’d had a few more cups than Adolin.\nShallan had a strange relationship with drink, one that varied based on her\npersona. But since she could burn off the effects using Stormlight, she\ntheoretically could never be drunk unless she wanted to be. It baffled him\nwhy she would sometimes go to sleep like she did, risking the morning\nhangover.\n“I want someone to scout the town before we go in,” Adolin said. “You\nwant me to send—”\n“I’ll go,” she said, climbing out of her bedroll. “Give me a few minutes.”\nTrue to her word, she was ready a short time later, wearing a\nLightweaving that made her look like a cultivationspren. She took Vathah in\na similar disguise, and the two of them disembarked with Ua’pam and his\ncousin to walk through the town.\nThe rest of them waited under the tarp. Godeke fished in his pockets and\nbrought out a few spheres. His personal money seemed to mostly have been\nchips—which had gone dun by this point. They’d seen a highstorm several\ntimes—storms manifested here as shimmering lights in the sky—but the\nspheres hadn’t been recharged.\n“Even the broam I brought is starting to fade,” Godeke noted, holding up\nthe amethyst to give light to the darkness under the tarp. “The larger\ngemstones we brought probably won’t last until we reach the fortress,\nBrightlord.”\nAdolin nodded. They’d gone over the Stormlight budget a dozen times\nleading up to leaving. No matter how they’d been able to spin it, there\nwasn’t a way to reach Lasting Integrity with any Stormlight remaining. So\nthe gifts they’d brought were things Syl said would be appreciated: newly\nwritten books, puzzles made of iron that could engage the mind for hours,\nand some weapons.\nThere was one way they might have brought Stormlight that lasted\nlonger. The Thaylens owned gemstones that were—because of their near-\nperfect structures—capable of retaining Stormlight over long time periods.\nThe best of those had been used a year ago to capture one of the Unmade,\nand Jasnah wanted the others for experiments.\nJasnah had mentioned something else about these near-flawless\ngemstones that troubled her. She found it odd that the gemstones in\ncirculation as spheres were always so flawed that they lost Light quickly.\nShe said that they should vary, and more perfect ones should be found on\noccasion—but that wasn’t the case."

He pondered the question as he waited\nfor Shallan, and tried to trace Jasnah’s thoughts. What if someone had been\nin the know, while everyone else thought gemstones were all basically the\nsame? If you knew the supreme value of gemstones that could hold\nStormlight over long trips through Shadesmar, you could spend years\ngathering them.\nHe frowned, considering it. Finally, he glanced at Godeke, who was\nholding up one of his fading broams.\n“When you’re free to go into the city,” Adolin told him, “take most of\nour remaining Stormlight and do as we discussed. Trade it for supplies to\nuse on the next leg of our trip—then spend the remainder to load up the\nbarge.”\nUa’pam’s cousin would wait at the town to guard their supplies. Adolin’s\ngroup only needed to carry enough to get to and from Lasting Integrity.\nAssuming everything went well with Shallan’s investigation of the town.\nAs they waited, Adolin found himself feeling increasingly anxious. He felt\nlike something was going to drop on him. Had the trip here been too easy?\nHe passed the time checking on his soldiers and scribe. As they were in\ngood spirits, Adolin checked on Maya. She sat in a little nook at the rear of\nthe room, and Adolin had to pull out a gemstone—a thick sapphire, big as\nhis thumb—to get enough light to see her.\nMaya stared at it. Her eyes had been scratched out by the events of the\nRecreance, but she could still see. She’d been blinded without going blind,\nkilled without dying. The ways of spren were strange.\n“Hey,” he said, crouching down. “We’ll soon be able to go ashore.”\nShe didn’t respond, as usual—though as one of the peakspren passed\noutside the tarp awning, she snapped her head to stare in that direction.\n“Anxious too, eh?” Adolin said. “We both need to calm down. Here.” He\nmoved to where his things had been stored and took out his longsword, then\nfell into a stance. The ceiling of the tarp was a good foot over his head, and\nmost everyone had clustered on the other side, near Godeke and the\nspheres. So he had some space for a basic kata.\nEach day, Maya joined him in his morning stretching routines, where he\ndid a centering kata that Zahel had taught him years ago. Would she follow\na different kata, if he showed it to her? A longsword was a bad imitation of\na Shardblade, but it was the closest he had.\nHe placed his sapphire on the top of his closed sword trunk for light,\nthen fell into a slow, careful kata meant to teach thrusting practice. Nothing\nflashy, no stupid twirls or spins of the blade. A basic exercise, but one he’d\ndone hundreds of times with his Shardblade on the practice grounds. This\nparticular portion imitated hallway fighting, where you couldn’t swing too\nhigh or too far to the sides, lest you hit stone. So it was perfect for this\nenclosed space."

So it was perfect for this\nenclosed space.\nMaya watched him, her head cocked.\n“You know this one,” he told her. “Remember? Hallway fighting.\nPractice with thrusts and controlled swings?”\nHe started over, but slower. One motion flowing into the other. Step,\ngood two-handed grip, lunge forward with a thrust, then reset while turning\nthe other direction. Back and forth, a rhythm, a song without music. A fight\nwithout an opponent.\nMaya hesitantly stood up, so he paused. She walked over to him,\ninspecting his sword with her head still cocked. The fine intertwining vines\nof her face looked like sinew, a human face with the skin removed. She\ntraced the length of the sword with her gaze.\nAdolin reset again. Maya carefully did the same beside him—and her\nform was perfect. Even Zahel on his worst day wouldn’t have found reason\nto reset her stance. Adolin slowly moved through the kata, and she followed\n—holding nothing but empty air, but moving in lockstep with him as he\nthrust, then reset, then turned.\nConversation on the other side of the enclosure died off, spren and\nsoldiers alike watching. Soon they faded from Adolin’s attention. It was just\nhim, the sword, and Maya. The relaxing repetition made his tension melt\naway. Katas were about more than training; they were a way to focus. That\nwas something every young swordsman needed to learn, whether he\nintended to fight in duels or lead a battlefield charge. Adolin felt sorry for\nthose who had never known the centering peace of training; it could turn\naside even the mightiest of storms.\nAfter some time—Adolin didn’t notice how much—Shallan ducked\nunder the tarp. She’d dismissed her Lightweaving, so plainly didn’t\nconsider them to be in any danger. Ua’pam, however, stared at Maya, the\ncracks in his skin pouring a molten light over the deck and the bottom of the\ntarp.\nAdolin finally stopped, Maya pausing beside him. As he relaxed and\nwiped his brow, she settled back down in her little cubby.\nUa’pam walked up to him, scratching at his head in a distinctly human\ngesture. “Another kata?” he asked. “This is more than simple training.\nTruly, you must tell me. How have you done this? Each day, your training\nof her proves more remarkable.”\nAdolin shrugged, snatching a towel as Felt tossed it to him. “She\nremembers the times we’ve sparred together as man and Blade.”\n“She’s a deadeye,” Ua’pam said. “She was killed thousands of years ago.\nShe doesn’t think. The trauma of her Radiant betraying her broke her\nmind.”\n“Yeah, well, maybe it’s wearing off.”\n“We are spren. We are eternal. Our deaths do not merely ‘wear off.’”\nAdolin tossed the towel back to Felt. “And spren were never going to\nbond humans again—yet here you are, Zu’s companion spren. Words like\n‘eternal’ and ‘forever’ aren’t as definitive as you all pretend.”"

The spren at this waystop won’t consider us odd. We merely need\nto tell everyone we’re traders.”\n“Right then,” Adolin said. “Let’s all get off this boat and stretch our legs.\nStay together in groups though, and don’t make trouble.”\n* * *\nShallan continued to have a hangover. Her brain pounded, incessant, angry.\nA kind of “How could you?” accusation. She worried that now that they had\nreached land, she might attract painspren—which could be dangerous.\nThis is your fault, Veil, Radiant thought at her. How could you let us go\nto sleep without burning off the wine?\nI wasn’t thinking straight, Veil thought. That’s kind of the point of\ndrinking.…\nShe can’t use Stormlight very well, Shallan thought. Don’t blame her. At\nleast the pain was fading. When she’d taken in Stormlight to put on her\nillusory face, it had healed some of the agony. Stormlight was precious,\nhowever, and she’d used only what she needed to get her illusion going.\nShe probably could spare a little more.\nNo, Radiant thought. We should suffer, as our punishment for abusing\ndrink.\nIt’s not Shallan’s fault, Veil complained. She shouldn’t have to hurt\nbecause of what I did.\nI had more than a few cups myself, Shallan thought. So let’s drop this.\nThe others—eager to get out and see the town—broke up into teams,\nthough Adolin waited for her. They walked onto the simple stone dock and\ninto the town—though “town” was a generous term for it. She’d been able\nto walk through all four streets in under half an hour.\nStill, although small, the place presented a shocking variety of spren,\nmost of them coming from the five or six caravans that were camped here at\nthe moment. Even from her perspective now, she was able to spot six\ndifferent varieties. She’d taken some Memories to continue her natural\nhistory—and intended to go back out and get a few more.\nPlus, some of those caravans had humans in them. Who were they? How\nhad they found their way to this side? Were they from other lands, like\nAzure? She longed to get back out and do closer inspections.\nExcept … Veil said. You know.\nShe did. This might be a chance to—after two weeks of travel—finally\nhave some time alone. Indeed, Unativi’s sailors were drawing lots to\ndetermine who had to stay on the barge to guard it. Perhaps …\n“Go on ahead,” Veil said, pulling her hat on—from where it had been\nhanging behind her neck by its laces—so Adolin knew who she was. “I’ve"

Watch our\nthings.”\nHe went and got Maya, who followed when he asked. He likely thought\nshe needed to get some exercise or something. He was a little strange about\nthat spren.\nI think the way he cares for her is sweet, Shallan thought.\nMaybe it was. But it was strange too. Veil sauntered over to Unativi.\n“You can all go, if you want,” she said to the group of peakspren. “I’m\ngoing to stay behind anyway, so I can watch the barge.”\nUnativi studied her, the light of his molten interior growing brighter\nthrough the cracks in his skin. “You stay? Why?”\nShe shrugged. “I’ve had a chance already today. You can all go; the boat\ndoesn’t need more than one guard. It’s not like there’s any danger here,\nright?”\n“If there were,” Unativi said, “you are Radiant. Better at facing it than a\npeakspren!” He turned to his sailors, who seemed eager. A couple of weeks\non the same barge could make anyone bored of the scenery, including\nsailors.\nSoon, Veil was blessedly alone. So far this trip, she’d been alone only\nwhen using the chamber pot in the draped-off section beneath the tarp. Even\nthat had been situated far too near everyone else for comfort. She—\n“Mmmmm…”\nShe spun and found that of course Pattern was still there. Watching her.\n“Going to contact Mraize, Veil?” he asked with a peppy voice. “Mmm…”\nYes, she was. All three were in agreement that they needed to talk to\nhim, but it was uncomfortable how easily Pattern recognized this.\n“Stay here,” she said to him, “and make certain nobody interrupts me.”\n“Oh. I can’t listen?” His pattern slowed, seeming to almost wilt. “I like\nMraize. He is very strange. Ha ha.”\n“It would be better if someone were to watch out for me,” Veil said.\nThen she sighed. “Though it might be good for you to listen to Mraize too.\nYou might spot something untrue that he says.”\n“I do not think he says things that are fully untrue,” Pattern said. “Which\nmakes his lies the best. Mmm. But I cannot tell automatically if something\nis a lie. I can simply appreciate them better than most, once I realize what\nthey are.”\nWell, in Veil’s experience, he was more expert at noticing subterfuge\nthan many humans. She waved for him to join her under the awning, still\nhappy to be mostly alone.\nPart of her worried about that emotion. She’d lived a double life for\nbasically the entire time she’d known Adolin—and it put a strain on\nShallan. Worse, lying to herself was so ingrained it was becoming second\nnature."

Worse, lying to herself was so ingrained it was becoming second\nnature.\nThis is a problem, Shallan, Veil thought as she made her way back to her\ntrunk.\nI’m getting better, Shallan retorted. No new personas in over a year now.\nAnd Formless? Radiant demanded.\nFormless isn’t real. Not yet, Shallan thought. We’re close to getting out\nof the Ghostbloods. One more mission, and we’re done. And Formless won’t\nmanifest.\nVeil had her suspicions. And she had to admit, she was a big part of the\nproblem herself. Shallan idealized how Veil was able to live so relaxed,\nwithout worrying about her past or the things she’d done. Indeed, Shallan\nconflated this attitude with the life the Ghostbloods lived. A life she was\nbeginning to envy …\nGet answers, Shallan thought. Stop thinking about this. We need to\ncontact Mraize before time runs out.\nVeil sighed, but positioned Pattern near the open front of the tarp\nenclosure. He would be able to hear the conversation with Mraize, but\ncould warn her if someone came onto the barge. Then she unlocked her\ntrunk of personal effects.\nHere she paused. Then she let Shallan take over for a few moments.\nLong enough to be certain.\nYes, Shallan thought. It has been moved again.\nThey’d checked it every day since that first time, and this was only the\nsecond time it had been moved. The night she’d gotten drunk. Inside,\nRadiant groaned in annoyance.\nSorry, Veil thought, taking over. But we can’t watch it all the time.\nBesides, we want the spy to feel comfortable using it, right? So that we have\nmore chances to catch them?\nRegardless, she couldn’t deny it felt creepy to know someone had snuck\nin and somehow used the cube while she was snoring a few feet away. She\nlifted the cube and inspected it. Other than having been set so a different\nface was up, nothing about it seemed different.\nHow did she activate it? Mraize had said to use his name. “I need to\nspeak to Mraize. Um, that’s actually his title rather than his name.…”\nThe cube’s corners began to shine from a bright light inside, as if the\nmetal were thinner there.\n“I know him,” the cube said, making Veil start.\n“You can talk!” she said.\nIt didn’t reply. She frowned, looking closely at the seams—the glow\nshimmered and changed. A short time later a strong voice came from inside,\nmaking the cube quiver in her hands.\n“Little knife,” Mraize said. “I’ve been waiting.”\n* * *\nAdolin kept to his own rules, and didn’t wander off alone.

His\nworries were resurfacing, now that the voyage was over. He needed to\nprove he could bring the honorspren to the coalition. After failing at\nKholinar, he just … he needed to do this. Not for his father. For the\ncoalition. For the war. For his homeland.\nHe tried to focus on the next step, which involved getting supplies at this\nwaystop. It was basically a market, meant to cater to caravans and merchant\nships. Like in Celebrant—the other spren city he’d visited—most of the\nbuildings were made up of a mishmash of types of stone, speckled a variety\nof colors. Manifested building materials. Real rock and metal were far more\nvaluable here, as they had to be transported in through a portal like the\nOathgates.\nThere was no cohesive sense of architecture to the buildings. Azish\ninfluences were most common, but spren took what they could get, and so\nended up with a patchwork of designs and styles. Most of the spren running\nthe shops appeared to be cultivationspren. They called out offers in Azish or\nAlethi, offering fresh water or food supplies they knew humans might want.\nBrowsing the goods were spren of all varieties. Of those, he found the\nashspren the most transfixing. They looked like people, but their flesh\nwould crumble off at times, exposing bone. As he passed one, she snapped\nher fingers, making all the ash of her hand blow away and vanish—then it\nquickly grew back. He even spotted a couple of highspren, like tears in\nreality in the shape of people. He gave them a wide berth, though they\nseemed to be just another pair of merchants.\nSpren clothing was as eclectic as their building materials. He passed one\npeakspren wearing a Veden uniform coat over a Tashikki wrap, of all things.\nIt should have been garish—and certainly Adolin would never have worn\nany of it together—but he didn’t find himself bothered. They’d taken human\nclothing and made it their own; why should they follow the trends of\nkingdoms in another world?\nIn that way, there was something fresh and interesting about the fashion\nhere. Like the work of a talented but untrained artist. They came up with\ncombinations that no member of Adolin’s culture could ever have dared\nimagine.\nThough, he thought, passing a tall willowy spren of a type he didn’t\nrecognize, someone ought to tell that one what a protective cup is used for\non our side.…\nHis soldiers stopped to browse a weapon shop, though he’d warned them\nthat they shouldn’t rely on manifested weapons. Still, it was difficult not to\nstare at the sheer variety of swords on display. In the Physical Realm a\nmasterwork sword was an expensive purchase—and it often surprised\npeople how valuable even an everyday side sword could be. Here though,\nmanifesting a sword took roughly the same amount of Stormlight as\nmanifesting a brick, so you could find them in barrels or stacked in piles\noutside shops.\nThis bizarre economy would certainly fascinate Shallan.

He’d heard they\nkept near-perfect gemstones in spren banks, storing vast amounts of\nStormlight for future use. And of course, having so many humans nearby\nhad attracted small emotion spren, Shadesmar’s equivalent of animals.\nGloryspren darted overhead, and fearspren huddled in alleyways looking\nlike large, multi-legged eels with long, globby antennae.\nA long flying spren with mustaches and a graceful body landed on the\ntop of a building, then leaped off, ejecting an explosion of tiny crystalline\nshards that floated down and vanished. Was that a passionspren? He’d have\nto tell Shallan.\nHe turned toward the distant barge, where Shallan remained. Maya\ndutifully stopped beside him, but just stared straight ahead with her\nscratched-out eyes.\n“I wonder why she stayed behind,” Adolin said. “It’s odd for her to want\nto rest when there’s so much to see.”\nMaya didn’t respond. That didn’t prevent him from talking to her. She\nhad a … relaxing air about her.\n“Veil probably is in control,” Adolin said. “She’s worried about our\nthings being stolen, I bet. Shallan says the other two exist to protect her or\nhelp her, and I see that. I want to understand. I don’t want to be like the\nothers, who whisper about her being crazy and laugh.”\nHe looked to Maya, who looked back.\n“It’s silly of me to be jealous of the time Veil controls her, isn’t it?”\nAdolin said. “Shallan created Veil as a tool. It’s just … I don’t know if I’m\ndoing this right. I don’t know how to be supportive.”\nHe wasn’t good with relationships. He never had been. He could admit\nthat to himself now. He’d been in dozens, and they’d all fallen apart—so he\nhad all kinds of experience doing this wrong, but very little doing it right.\nHe wanted to do it right. He loved Shallan, in part because of her\neccentricities. She felt alive in a different way from everyone else—she was\nalso somehow more authentic. She was stuffed full of personas and covered\nin illusions. Yet incredibly, she felt more real because of them.\nAdolin lingered, not wanting to get ahead of the others, and wished he\ncould shove his hands in his pockets. Unfortunately, this uniform’s pockets\nwere sewn shut. The trousers looked better that way.\nHe knew why he was feeling so off. Seeing another spren settlement\nreminded him of the last time they’d come to Shadesmar. When he’d been\nforced to leave Elhokar dead in his palace, the city fallen. Worse, Adolin\nhad accidentally abandoned his troops to face the invasion while he ended\nup in Shadesmar.\nHe wasn’t one to stew and brood … but storms, if there was a man who\ndeserved his place in Damnation, it was the general who left his men to die.\nAdolin was drawn out of his brooding as he realized Maya was staring to\nthe side, focused on something.

That was odd enough, as she didn’t often\npay much attention to her surroundings. But when he drew closer, he saw\nwhat had transfixed her. It was another deadeye.\nThis deadeye was a Cryptic who stood beside a storefront. Cryptics\ndidn’t have eyes, but there was no mistaking that the creature had suffered\nMaya’s fate: the pattern had halted completely, the normally graceful lines\ntwisted and turned in jagged directions, like broken fingers. The same odd\nscraping marred its center.\nMaya released a kind of low whine from deep in her throat.\n“I’m sorry,” Adolin said. “I know it’s distressing. Let’s move on\nquickly.”\nShe took his arm as he tried to walk off, which shocked him. It seemed\nto surprise her too, as she looked down at her hands holding his arm, then\ncocked her head. She held on and turned toward the deadeye Cryptic,\npulling him. It was as if she wanted to say something.\nHis men were still shopping, so Adolin turned in the direction Maya\nwanted, heading toward the store with the deadeye. Like most he’d seen\nhere in Shadesmar, the shop was open-sided—an awning in front of a small\nbuilding where the shopkeepers probably lived. There weren’t storms to\nworry about here, so structures tended to have open-air designs that left\nAdolin feeling exposed.\nThe shopkeeper was an inkspren. Adolin had heard that there were fewer\nof them than there were of other varieties, and they kept to themselves. The\ncreature was jet black, even reflective, like he was made out of stone—but\nwith an oil-on-water shimmer of color when the light hit him right. He sold\nbooks, which he kept carefully on shelves, not in stacks and piles like many\nother shops.\n“You are Alethi,” he said, inspecting Adolin. He spoke with a sharp nasal\naccent. “And you are male. You have no need for books. This is.”\n“I wanted to ask after your deadeye,” Adolin said, nodding to the\nCryptic.\n“A friend she was,” the shopkeeper said, his voice terse.\n“Back when there were Radiants.”\n“No. A sooner time that was. My partner in business, once.” He frowned.\n“Do you know something of this, human? The danger that is?”\n“What danger?”\n“New deadeyes,” the shopkeeper said, shaking his head. “Radiants\nshould not have started again. Do you know that this thing is? In your\nkingdom it began, did it not?”\n“I don’t know of any Radiants betraying their oaths,” Adolin said.\n“You’re sure about this?”\nThe inkspren waved to his friend. “She was my partner for many\ncenturies. She left ten years ago to join others hunting for Radiants. Last\nyear I found her like this, sitting alone on an island far to the east. She\ninsisted on coming out this direction—at least, she walked this way\nincessantly. So I set up shop here.”\n“You’re sure,” Adolin said. “That she was afflicted like this recently.”\n“My memory is not flawed,” the inkspren said. “This is what you do,"

You should feel ashamed.” He looked at Maya. “Is this\nanother you killed?”\n“Of course not,” Adolin said. “I…” He trailed off, not wanting to say too\nmuch. He’d instructed everyone to be circumspect.\nBut … a new deadeye? That seemed impossible. Maybe … maybe some\nyoung new Surgebinder out in the backwaters of Bavland could have been\nleft without support or friends, and had broken their oaths. It wasn’t too\noutlandish; the more they learned, the more they realized that Kaladin,\nJasnah, and Shallan hadn’t been unique in forming new Radiant bonds these\nlast few years. A general revolution had been happening all across Roshar,\nwith spren sensing the coming of the Everstorm, and some returning to\nbond with humans.\nHe got nothing but more frosty accusations from the inkspren, so he\nreturned to the street—and Maya let him. Had she somehow known this\ndeadeye was strange? Was that why she’d wanted him to go in and talk to\nthe shopkeeper?\nHe moved to join his men, but stopped as he saw Godeke and his spren\nhastening up the street. The former ardent had a graceful way about him as\nhe arrived and fluidly bowed. “Brightlord, I think you’ll want to see this.”\n“What? It’s not another deadeye spren, is it?”\n“No,” Godeke said. “It’s the humans.”\nBut this does not get to the core of your letter. I have encouraged those\nwho would speak to me to heed your warnings, but all seem content to\nignore Odium for the time being. In their opinion, he is no threat as\nlong as he remains confined in the Rosharan system.\nLight shimmered in the strange cube, seeping through at the corners as\nMraize spoke. Veil watched, and suddenly felt disjointed—trapped between\ntwo moments.\nThis experience … she’d done this before. She’d been here, kneeling on\nthe ground, holding a cube that glowed from the corners. Exactly like this.\nShe reached to the top of the cube, feeling the smooth metal, and\nexpected it to be dimpled. She cocked her head, inspecting her fingers as\nshe lifted them up and rubbed them against her thumb. This was wrong.…\nShe glanced over her shoulder, and saw the enclosure beneath the tarp.\nShe was on a mission into Shadesmar. Why should she expect to see\ngardens behind her? Her father’s gardens?\nVeil faded into Shallan. These memories … these were something lost to\nher. From the years leading up to her … her mother’s death.

And—she looked back at the cube—she’d held one of these?\nShe gripped the cube tightly, becoming hyperfocused on Mraize’s voice.\nShe couldn’t think about the past. She couldn’t. Unfortunately, the sounds\ncoming out of the cube seemed garbled to her. Her mind fixated on each\nsyllable alone, and she couldn’t understand the Alethi as a language—it was\ninstead a jumble of sounds.\nShe shook herself, and the barge seemed to lurch beneath her. She\ngasped, forcing Veil to take over, and Mraize’s words started to make sense.\n“… have been careful,” Mraize was saying, “not to attract attention in\nthis communication?”\n“I…” Veil said. “Of course I did this in secret. You know me better than\nthat.” What had he been saying before? She’d missed it entirely.\n“It is always good,” he said, “to reinforce the behavior you want, little\nknife. In people as in axehounds. Your report?”\n“We have landed,” she said, “and the others went out to explore a small\ndockside town here on the coast. We have several weeks’ further travel via\ncaravan, hopefully as uneventful as these, before reaching the fortress.”\n“Have you learned anything of interest about your fellow Radiants?”\n“Nothing I’d report to you, Mraize,” Veil said. “Mostly I wanted to make\nsure this cube of yours worked.” She considered. “What happens again if I\npry the thing open?”\n“You will immediately destroy the spren that lives inside,” Mraize said.\n“You can’t kill spren.”\n“I didn’t say kill.”\nShe held up the cube. Light escaped from the corners—had the cube\nopened a little? “Perhaps I do have a tidbit for you,” she said. “Something I\nmight be willing to trade for information about this cube.”\n“That is not your mission, nor our arrangement, little knife,” Mraize said\n—sounding amused. “The hound does not withhold affection to get her\nfeast. She performs first, and then receives her reward.”\n“You tell me to be the hunter, not the prey,” Veil said. “Yet snap at me\nwhen I show initiative?”\n“Initiative is wonderful, and your possession of it is commendable.\nHowever, our organization survives based on principles of hierarchy. A\ngroup of hunters working together could turn upon one another far too\neasily.\n“And so, I respect my babsk, and you respect me. We do not strike\nagainst our own, and we do not negotiate upward. To do otherwise is to\ninvite anarchy. So continue to hunt, but do not think to hold hostage your\nresults. Now, is there anything else to report on the mission that might be\nrelevant?”\nHe didn’t press her further on information about the other Radiants; so in\nessence, he conceded that point. She hadn’t been assigned to report on\nthem, and he knew he had no right to press for that information.\nNote this fact, Veil thought. There is wiggle room in this arrangement,\ndespite what he implies."

There is wiggle room in this arrangement,\ndespite what he implies.\n“There have been some odd spren watching us,” Veil noted. “I only catch\nglimpses of them, but they seem the wrong color. As if they’d been\ncorrupted.”\n“Curious,” Mraize said. “Sja-anat extends her influence. I am still\nwaiting for the spren she promised would bond me.”\n“She promised to send a spren,” Veil said. “Not that the spren would\nchoose you. Do not blame Shallan if you fail to secure what you want.”\n“And yet, Sja-anat spies on you during this trip. These spren you see?\nWhat can you tell me about them?”\n“They’re all the same variety, and they stay far away or obscured\nsomehow. None of the others on our trip have seen them, though I’ve\nwarned my team to watch for them.”\n“Sja-anat is important, little hunter,” Mraize said. “We must bind her to\nus. A spren of Odium willing to betray him? An ancient creature with\nequally ancient knowledge? I give you this secondary mission. Watch for\nthese spren closely, and make contact if you can.”\n“I will,” Veil said. “Is there news of the tower or of Dalinar’s invasion?”\n“Oh, things here are subject to their usual flares of activity and surprise,”\nMraize said. “Nothing unexpected for those who have been paying\nattention. I will let you know if anything here requires your involvement.”\nVeil nodded, feeling distracted as the sensation of holding the cube\novercame her once more. She forced Shallan to take control again, to see\nthe shadows of reflections of memories. She breathed in and out, trying to\nforce herself to remain strong. To not run.\nShould she ask Mraize whether he knew anything of her past, and\nwhether she’d ever communicated this way before? He’d be unlikely to\nanswer, but that wasn’t why she hesitated.\nI don’t want to know, she thought. Instead she said, “I will contact you\nonce we have traveled a distance on the caravan.”\n“Very well,” Mraize said. “Again, I must emphasize: Watch for any signs\nof these corrupted gloryspren. I worry that Sja-anat is playing us both, and I\ndo not like the feeling.”\nShallan almost dropped the cube in surprise. She intentionally hadn’t\nmentioned the specific variety of spren. Yet he called them gloryspren.\nHA! Veil thought.\nOh, storms, Radiant thought. Veil’s plan worked. She’s going to be\ninsufferable now.\nInsufferable? I’m incredible. Mraize has fallen into a common trap—that\nof being so clever, you start forgetting your fundamentals. Always question\nyour information.\n“Understood,” Shallan forced herself to say. “I will keep diligent watch.”\nThe glow in the cube faded. She carefully set it back in the chest, then took\nanother Memory of it there before locking the lid.\nWord had gotten to Mraize, and the false tidbit—that she’d seen a\ngloryspren watching her—had revealed the truth.\nBeryl was the spy.\n* * *"

They didn’t\nappear to be soldiers, but common workers with brown skin and black hair,\nboth male and female. You found some Vorin people with that skin tone, but\nmore likely you’d find it in midlands. Marat, Tukar, the Reshi Isles.\nThey wore simple clothing of a cut Adolin thought he recognized as\nbeing from southeastern Makabak. It had colors similar to Azish patterns,\nbut the cloth was thicker and coarser, the outfits more enveloping, with\nbraided tassels that hung low from the waist.\nYes, he thought. They look like they’re from Marat, or maybe Tukar.\nMultiple caravans had made camps outside town, and all the others had\nspren occupants. As Adolin and Godeke had passed, those had waved or\ngestured in friendly ways. One had even called out to Archinal—Godeke’s\nspren—recognizing her.\nThis human camp, by contrast, was an unwelcoming place. While the\nspren camps had manifested fires, this one was dark, lit by neither flame nor\nStormlight. The human caravan had brought no pack animals, but the\npeople had piled their things in the center of camp while some of their\nnumber slept. The rest of them, mostly men with cudgels resting on\nshoulders, watched the perimeter.\n“Who are they?” Adolin asked softly, watching from beside the wall of a\nsmall shop. The landscape outside the town was relatively barren, an open\nfield of obsidian with some small crystalline plants growing in clusters,\nbobbing with lifespren—which were larger on this side.\n“Traders from another land perhaps?” Archinal said. The short\ncultivationspren wrung her hands. “Oh, it does happen, and more and more\nthese days. People come in caravans seeking to trade. They like your wines,\nhuman brightlord. And many have heard tales of your weapons, and I’ve\nknown several to ask to trade for one! As if a Shardblade would be\navailable for purchase.”\n“Other lands,” Adolin said, rubbing his chin. “Maybe some other traders\nyou met are from far away, but these are wearing Marati or Tukari clothing.\nThey seem like locals to me—but if that’s the case, I’m left wondering how\nthey got here. We only recently learned how to cross into Shadesmar, and it\nrequires the aid of a Radiant. How did a trading caravan from our world slip\nthrough into here?”\n“That’s why I fetched you,” Godeke said. “Something feels off about the\nwhole group.”\n“They could still be foreigners,” Archinal said. “They could be wearing\nmanifested clothing they traded for while here. Oh! You mustn’t assume\nthat what you see here relates to what you know from your life, human\nhighprince.”\n“We could ask them, right?” Godeke said. “See if they’ll talk to us?”\nThe two exchanged a look, and then Adolin shrugged. Why not? He\nwalked out, joined by Godeke and his spren, Maya trailing along behind."

He\nwalked out, joined by Godeke and his spren, Maya trailing along behind.\nHe was noticed immediately by the caravaneers. One pointed, and a\nsmall group rushed up. The lighting of this place—with that distant sun, but\nstrangely omnipresent illumination—played tricks on Adolin’s eyes. The\nshadows stretched the wrong way, and distance was harder to judge. So\nAdolin was accustomed to things feeling off.\nEven with that considered, the way these people seemed to be constantly\nwreathed in shadow … it was unnerving. As they stepped up, he felt like he\ncould see only hints of features, and no matter which way they turned, the\npits of their faces—the eye sockets, the lines along their noses—were\nalways dark. He saw occasional glimpses of their eyes.\nThey spoke to him in a language he didn’t know.\n“Do you speak Alethi?” he asked. “Or Veden?”\n“Gthlebn Thaylen?” Godeke asked.\n“Alethi?” one of the men said. “Go away, Alethi.”\nYes, that was a Tukari accent. “We just want to chat,” Adolin said. “We\nhaven’t seen other humans here. We thought it would be nice to talk to\nothers.”\n“Go away,” the man repeated. “We not talk.”\nAdolin glanced past him, to where some of the humans had moved to\nfish among their goods. Though the people he spoke with carried cudgels,\nhe caught a glint of reflected light among the others. They were carrying\nreal weapons, but didn’t want to hold them openly.\n“Fine,” Adolin said. “Suit yourselves.”\nHe and the others retreated to the town. The Tukari watched them all the\nway.\n“Those were Tukari,” Godeke said.\n“Yeah,” Adolin said. “Their country is led by a man claiming to be a god\n—who is actually a Herald. Father is planning to push the singer army in\nEmul down to crush them against those zealots. A hammer-and-anvil\nadvance.”\nWere these strange travelers somehow connected to that business in\nTukar? Or was it a coincidence?\nAdolin met up with his soldiers, and they walked back toward the barge.\nThey’d want to get on with unloading their supplies and making camp.\nArchinal had been to the honorspren stronghold before, and was confident\nshe could lead them there. It shouldn’t be difficult; if they simply followed\nthe coast to the west, they’d eventually end up at the place.\nAs they approached the barge, however, Adolin slowed. A figure was\nspeaking to Unativi in front of the barge—a figure of white, tinted blue.\nTall, distinguished. Adolin was accustomed to seeing this spren in a sharp\nuniform, not a buttoned shirt and trousers, but it was the same person.\n“Is that an honorspren?” Godeke asked.\n“Yes,” Adolin said, continuing forward. “That’s Notum. The captain of\nthe ship we sailed on last time we were in Shadesmar.”\nIt seemed his confrontation with the honorspren might happen sooner\nthan he’d planned.\n* * *"

The locked chest beside her held the strange communications\ndevice, now re-created in her sketches.\nShe’d attracted a few spren out of the ocean. Creationspren, which here\nwere little swirling shapes of changing colors of light. They evoked\ndifferent impressions, often faces. But they were small, and easy to treat\nlike spren in the Physical Realm. She shooed them away as Pattern sat\ndown beside her.\n“Mmmm…” he said. “You have drawn the same cube four times,\nShallan. Are you well?”\n“No,” she said, “but this isn’t a sign of that.” She flipped through her\nsketchbook. “Someone has been moving this cube. Between times I get it\nout.”\nPattern’s pattern slowed to almost a crawl. “You are certain?”\n“Yes,” she said, showing him the sketches. “There’s a scratch on this\nside near the corner, and that face was up yesterday—but it’s to the side\ntoday.”\n“Mmmm…” he said. “That is a very fine detail. One nobody else would\nhave noticed.”\n“Yeah,” she said. Her drawings were eerily accurate. Supernaturally so,\neven. “Beryl is the spy. I have evidence of this, and I know she’s been\ncontacting Mraize with the cube. I’m extremely curious how she activated it\nwithout drawing attention. Did you see her doing it?”\n“No,” he said. “I did not.”\n“Well, it’s a relief to know who it is,” Shallan said—and was surprised to\nfind that it was. She could accept this, the traitor being the new girl. Shallan\nhad begun to retreat at the idea of it being Vathah or Ishnah.\nBeryl. She could accept it being Beryl. That hurt—being betrayed would\nalways hurt—but it could have been worse.\nDamnation, Veil thought.\nWhat? Shallan thought. What’s wrong?\nDoes this feel too easy? Veil asked. Too convenient?\nVeil, Radiant thought. You went to all this trouble to seed the information\nand find the spy. Now you’re questioning?\nI just mentioned fundamentals, Veil replied. We need to question every\nbit of information, and ask ourselves if we’re being fed it. I need to think\nabout this more.\nShallan sighed, then shook her head. If Veil hadn’t gotten them drunk,\nthen maybe they’d have caught Beryl. She started sketching again, the cube\none more time—but this time adding dimples to the top. Did she remember?\nDid she want to remember?\n“Shallan?” Pattern said. “Mmm … Something is wrong, isn’t it?\nSomething more than there being a spy among us?”\n“I don’t know,” she said, rubbing her forehead. The remnants of her\nearlier hangover throbbed in the back of her mind. “Do … you remember\nme ever using a cube like this one when I was younger?”\n“Mmm. No?”\n“I did,” Shallan said. “I don’t know how, but I did. I can’t make sense of\nmy own memories though.”"

Adolin agrees, though I don’t think he sees what\nI do.”\n“What do you see?” she asked softly.\n“Something else looking out of your eyes, sometimes. Something new. It\ncomes out when … when I try to talk about your past. So I’m afraid to do it.\nSometimes you tease that you want me to say more. Then those other eyes\nsee me.”\n“There’s another truth,” Shallan whispered. “Another…”\n“Another…”\nShe squeezed her eyes shut. Veil, take over.\nBut—\nVeil found herself in control again, and heard voices drifting in from\noutside the barge. Adolin, strong and confident. Veil didn’t love him like\nShallan did, but she knew right then that they needed to be near him.\nShallan needed to be near him.\nNo, Shallan thought from deep within. No. He’ll hate me. He’ll hate …\nwhat I did.…\nVeil went to be near him anyway. But she couldn’t find it in herself to\ntell him of Shallan’s fears—she would not risk pain she wasn’t certain\nShallan could handle. She couldn’t risk giving more meat to Formless, and\nso remained silent.\n* * *\n“So it is you,” Notum said to Adolin. “You did not learn from your last\nexcursion into this land? You had to return?”\nNotum appeared as an Alethi man, sturdy and tall, with close-cropped\nhair and a militaristic attitude. He had a beard a little like that of a\nHorneater, with prominent sideburns running down his cheeks, but with an\nadditional thin mustache. It, along with his simple clothing, was all part of\nhim. Though some spren wore manifested clothing, honorspren created it\nfrom their own substance.\nNotum’s face was impassive, but his words dripped with condescension.\nWhy wasn’t he wearing his captain’s uniform? Was he on leave? His ship\ncertainly wasn’t anywhere nearby.\nThe spren—as extremely formal as Adolin remembered him being—\nclasped his hands behind his back to wait for a reply, reminding Adolin of\nhis father. Adolin waved for his soldiers to stay back, though Maya stuck by\nhis side as he stepped closer to Notum. The honorspren gave her barely a\nglance; they tended to ignore deadeyes.\n“I’ve been sent on a diplomatic mission, Notum,” Adolin said, “to visit\nLasting Integrity. I’m representing the new orders of Radiants and my\nfather, the king of Urithiru. Our monarchs have sent letters of introduction.\nWe hope to forge a new alliance.”\nThe honorspren opened his eyes wide and drew in a sharp breath—\nsomething spren only did for effect, as they didn’t normally breathe.\n“What?” Adolin said. “It’s that surprising?”\n“It wouldn’t be polite for me to interrupt,” Notum said. “Please continue\nyour insane rant.”"

It’s a\nperfectly reasonable request.”\nThe street nearby emptied as spren gave a wide berth to the honorspren.\nThey’d glance at him and veer in another direction. He wasn’t liked here.\nHis presence was suffered, but not enjoyed.\n“Let me posit a similar situation for you,” he said to Adolin. “A criminal,\non the run, has stolen a precious memento from the king—his beloved\ngoblet, perhaps. A memory of his lost wife. Would it be reasonable for this\nthief to stroll up to the palace one day and try to normalize relations\nbetween him and the king? Would that instead not be idiocy?”\n“We took nothing from the honorspren.”\n“Save the Stormfather’s most precious daughter.”\n“Syl made that choice,” Adolin said. “Even the Stormfather has\nacknowledged that. Besides, if she’s so precious, maybe you all could listen\nto her once in a while.” Maya growled softly at this comment, which drew\nboth Adolin and Notum to glance at her. Sounds from a deadeye were\nalways an oddity.\n“The Stormfather,” Notum said, “won’t be much help to you. Now that\nhe’s agreed to be bound, the honorspren no longer revere him as they once\ndid. They think he must have been wounded by the death of Honor, and that\nwound is now manifesting as irrational behavior. So yes, he no longer\ncommands the return of the Ancient Daughter. But do not think that will\nmake the honorspren welcome you.”\n“As soon as someone they respect tells them something reasonable, they\ncast him aside?” Adolin asked. “Spren are supposed to be better than men.”\n“I wish that were so,” Notum said, his voice quieter. “Prince Adolin. I\nam not an unreasonable person. You know this. I seek only to do my duty,\nthe best I can. Still, I can tell you exactly what will happen if you approach\nLasting Integrity. You will be turned away. Even friends of the honorspren\nare not allowed into the fortress currently, and you are anything but a friend.\n“To many there, you are a criminal. Your entire race is one of criminals.\nIt isn’t about the Ancient Daughter so much as it is about what you did to\nus.” Notum nodded his chin toward Maya.\n“Again, we did nothing to them,” Adolin said, keeping his tone calm\nthrough sheer force of will. “Maya and the others were killed thousands of\nyears ago.”\n“Not even a single lifetime to many spren,” Notum said. “We have long\nmemories, Prince Adolin. Perhaps you would not be blamed, save for the\nfact that your people have returned to those oaths. You have not learned\nfrom the past, and are restarting the abomination, bonding spren and risking\ntheir lives.”\n“These Radiants won’t do what those of the past did,” Adolin said.\n“Look, for thousands of years before the Recreance, spren and humans got\nalong. Will we let one event wipe that all out?”"

Your very soul?\nMen die, and their souls travel to the Spiritual Realm to meld with deity.\nBut what of us?”\nHe waved to Maya, standing in her rags, eyes scratched away. “We are\nleft,” Notum said, “to wander Shadesmar as dead souls, unable to think or\ntalk. Our bodies are used, screaming, as weapons by the descendants of the\nones who killed us. It was not a simple mistake that led us to this state, but a\ncoordinated and calculated betrayal of oaths.\n“Your people are criminals. The sole reason there was no swift\nretribution was because you killed every spren who could have acted\nagainst you. Do not go to Lasting Integrity. They will not accept letters\nfrom your kings and queens. They will not even speak to you.”\nNotum turned and stalked toward a small caravan set up outside. Judging\nby the organized layout—and the two uniformed Reachers guarding the\nperimeter—Adolin guessed it was Notum’s own caravan.\n“Captain,” Adolin called after him. “Perhaps my task is doomed as you\nsay. However, I can’t help but think that it would be helped if we had\nsomeone vouch for my intentions. Perhaps a respected honorspren, a ship’s\ncaptain and military man. Someone who understands the urgency of our\nmission.”\nNotum froze, then turned on his heel, his head cocked. “Ship’s captain?\nYou didn’t see my clothing?”\n“You’re … on leave?”\n“I was removed from duty,” Notum said, “for letting the Ancient\nDaughter go after capturing her. I spent five months in prison, and when I\nwas released I was demoted to the lowest rank an honorspren can hold. I’ve\nbeen assigned to spend two centuries patrolling the empty land between\nhere and Lasting Integrity, traveling back and forth endlessly. I am not\nallowed to set foot in Lasting Integrity. I can see it, but not enter.”\n“Until when?” Adolin asked. “Until … your patrol is done?”\n“Until never, Prince Adolin. I am exiled.” He looked up at the sky, where\nshimmering lights revealed a highstorm beginning to pass in the Physical\nRealm. “I knew what I was doing, what I was tempting, when I let you go.\nAt least tell me, did you save him? The Bondsmith?”\nAdolin swallowed, his mouth having gone dry. Exiled for eternity?\nBecause he had done the right thing? Adolin had known not to expect the\nhonorspren of Lasting Integrity to be like Syl was, but he’d been expecting\nto be able to speak with people such as Notum.

Tough, strict, but ultimately\nfair-minded people capable of listening to reason.\nBut if they had treated Notum—who had seemed the ultimate\nembodiment of propriety and honor—in such a terrible way … Stormwinds.\nNotum was still waiting for an answer. He’d let Syl and the rest of them\ngo because Kaladin had insisted they needed to rescue Dalinar. Adolin\nwanted to offer some kind of quick assurance that Notum’s sacrifice had\nbeen vital … but the words wouldn’t come out. This spren deserved\nhonesty.\n“He saved us, Notum,” Adolin said. “My father didn’t ultimately end up\nneeding our help—though I think that Shallan and Kaladin helped turn the\nbattle when we arrived.”\nNotum nodded. “I am marching along this road toward Lasting Integrity,\nbut will be forced to turn back when I draw near. Perhaps we will meet\nagain along the path, human prince, and I can dissuade you from this\ncourse.” He continued on.\nUa’pam and Zu were already on the barge, and they’d apparently\narranged for Adolin’s party to set up in one of the several camps established\noutside town. So Adolin joined the others as they unloaded their gear—\nhelping with the horses, then moving his weapons—all the while lost in\nthought.\nAdolin had been useless in that battle at Thaylen City. The world was\nabout gods and Radiants now, not handsome young lighteyes who fancied\nthemselves skilled with the sword. Best thing he could do was accept that,\nthen find a different way to be useful.\nHe would find a way to get the honorspren to listen to him. Somehow.\nI do not share their attitude. If you can, as you suppose, maintain\nOdium’s prison for now, it would give us necessary time to plan.

This put their vibrant patterns on\ndisplay across the full lengths of their sinuous bodies. Long-legged and\nlong-armed, they reminded Venli of her current form, which was tall\nwithout reaching the unnatural willowy level of Raboniel and the builders\nlike her.\nThe makay-im wore open-fronted robes, if they wore anything at all.\nThey stayed aloof from the rest of the strike team as they moved through\nthe frozen mountain passes. After weeks of traveling together, Venli still\nhadn’t been addressed directly by one of the Deepest Ones—though the\npace Raboniel set left little time for chitchat.\nThese mountains, as far as Venli could tell, weren’t claimed by any\nparticular kingdom.

Her team had been dropped in by Heavenly Ones several weeks\nbefore, then left to travel the rest of the way to Urithiru on foot.\nThe human fortress lay somewhere in here—presumed hidden and\nunassailable. Windrunner patrols made it impossible to fly in too close, but\nRaboniel felt that a small group of ground troops—moving carefully at\nnight or during storms—would be able to approach the lower tunnels to the\ntower unseen.\nSo it was that Venli joined the rest of the group in moving out from the\nshadow of tree cover, crossing the stone ground. As on other days, Raboniel\nset a characteristically difficult pace, though Venli knew she wouldn’t start\nto feel tired until they’d been going for a few hours.\nThe ancient scholar had changed from stately robes into travel leathers\nsuitable for battle, her topknot of pure red-orange hairstrands spilling down\naround her otherwise carapace-covered skull. She urged the group forward,\nincreasingly eager. They were nearing the tower; only a few days now.\nThis highland valley was mostly barren, supporting just the most rugged\nof rockbuds and the occasional clump of squat trees, their branches\ninterwoven to create a storm-resistant snarl. Though leaves on these trees\nwould retract before storms, the branches remained firm and interlocked.\nThere wasn’t a single lifespren in sight, though coldspren lined the ground,\npointing toward the sky.\nAs one might expect, there were more rockbuds on the leeward slopes,\nbut blasted scars of black ground and burned patches showed that when the\nEverstorm came through, it did not temper its fury. The heights seemed to\nsuffer more lightning strikes than the lowlands did.\nShe hiked more quickly to pass the soldiers and position herself next to\nthe Deepest Ones. She liked watching them, because they melded with the\nstone, even as they moved. The bright azure light of Honor’s Moon\nrevealed thirty figures, some in rippling robes, sliding across the ground\nwhile standing. It wasn’t quite like the shetel-im, the Flowing Ones, who\ncould slide across any surface as if it were slick. This was something\ndifferent. The Deepest Ones stood with their feet sunken into the ground up\npast their ankles.\nThey moved like nothing Venli had ever seen. Like sticks in a current\nfollowing a powerful highstorm, as if the stone were pushing them along\nwhile they stood perfectly still. Their eyes glowed red—like those of all\nFused and Regals—but theirs seemed a more sinister, dark shade.\n“They interest you, I’ve noticed,” a voice said from Venli’s side.\nShe jumped, and turned to find Raboniel walking alongside her. Venli\nattuned Anxiety, and Timbre thrummed within her, worried. Had she been\npaying too much attention? Would it be seen as suspicious? She lowered her\nhead and hummed to Agony. Already she worried this mission risked\nexposing her bond.\n“No need to be ashamed,” Raboniel said to Conceit. “Curiosity is\nwelcome in singers. It is a worthy Passion, Last Listener.”\nVenli held Anxiety as she walked—at a swift hike—beneath Raboniel’s\ngaze. She intended to serve this Fused well, as Leshwi had asked. Of the"

Of the\nstaff, only Venli was Regal, so only she could make this difficult trip. So far,\nshe had served the femalen in quiet capacities: setting out her bedroll at\nnight, fetching water for her to drink. She hadn’t been given many other\nduties, and had barely been addressed. She’d begun to think that serving\nRaboniel would be—if not easy—at least uneventful. Why was she now\ndrawing the femalen’s attention?\n“You are such an odd choice by Leshwi,” Raboniel said. “When I\ndiscovered just who had been given as my new Voice … To so many, you\nare merely the child of traitors. Yet Leshwi gave you honor. Named you\nLast Listener.”\n“She was kind, Ancient One.”\n“She thinks highly of you,” Raboniel said. “Fused are not kind; they\nreward competence and Passion. Even if one is the daughter of traitors. I\nshould have expected Leshwi’s Voice to be someone … irregular. She is\namong the most clever and capable of the Heavenly Ones.”\n“She … might dispute that, Ancient One.”\n“Yes, I realize how much work she does to make others underestimate\nher.” Raboniel said it to Satisfaction. “She is dangerous, and that is good.”\nShe looked to Venli and blinked her red eyes once, humming softly to\nSatisfaction.\nTimbre thrummed within Venli. Raboniel knew too much. She’d plainly\ndiscerned that Venli was a spy for Leshwi. But how much more had\nRaboniel figured out? Surely she didn’t know the full truth.\n“Tell me,” Raboniel said. “What about the Deepest Ones interests you\nso? Why do you spend hours staring at them?”\n“I find their powers fascinating,” Venli said—best not to lie until she had\nto.\n“Nine brands of Fused,” Raboniel said. “Nine Surges. You know of the\nSurges?”\n“The innate forces by which all life, all reality, are connected.\nGravitation. Transportation. Transformation. But … I thought there were\nten?”\n“That is human talk,” Raboniel said to Derision. “They claim a tenth, of\nHonor alone. Adhesion is not a true Surge, but a lie that was presented to us\nas one. True Surges are of both Honor and Cultivation—Cultivation for life,\nHonor to make the Surge into natural law. Things must fall to the ground, so\nthey created Surges to make it happen.”\n“And the Surge of these ones?” Venli asked, gesturing toward the\nDeepest Ones.\n“Cohesion,” Raboniel said. “The Surge of Axial Connection—the Surge\nthat binds the smallest pieces of all objects to one another. The Surge that\nholds us together. The makay-im can meld their essence into the essences of\nother things, intermingling their axi. All things are mostly emptiness,\nthough we cannot see that it is so. A stone, like a mind, exists to be filled by\nthought and Investiture.”\nVenli hummed to Craving. Answers. Finally, answers.

She didn’t know\nwhat half of any of this meant, but to have one of the Fused answer so\neasily … It excited her, though Timbre thrummed to Caution.\n“The Radiants each have two Surges,” Venli said. “The Fused each have\none. So are the Radiants more powerful?”\n“Powerful? Is it better to have more abilities, or to have one ability\nhandled expertly? We of the Fused know our Surge with an intimacy a\nRadiant will never know. Humans. They were not created for this world,\nthese Surges, or the storms. Light leaks from humans like water through\nfingers. They get flares of great power, but cannot hold what they have.\n“One of the Fused can contain Light and bask in it indefinitely. Even a\nRegal such as you knows this power in a lesser way—most don’t know it,\nbut you contain a small amount of Voidlight in your gemheart. You can’t\nuse it actively, of course, but you might have felt it enflaming your\nemotions.\n“As for Fused, our dominance over our Surge is eternal. Where humans\nvisit, we reign.” She gestured toward the Deepest Ones. “Can any Radiant\nclaim to know the stones as these do, melding with rock, mixing their very\naxi? Radiants are so outwardly focused. They change the world, but ignore\nthemselves. Yes, a Radiant can cast a stone into the sky, but the shanay-im\ncan soar without worry of ever dropping.”\nVenli hummed to Craving, though she wasn’t certain she agreed.\nAlthough she had been timid about using her Radiant powers in Kholinar,\nthey excited her. Timbre said that she would be able to move stone, shape it.\nShe glanced at the Deepest Ones, who moved so quietly, so smoothly.\nNext to them, Venli’s own hiking gait—and that of the five hundred\nstormform soldiers marching behind—felt awkward. And she did feel envy\nat the way they flowed. So … why was it that the powers manifested\ndifferently in Radiants than they did in Fused?\nShe attuned Annoyance as she considered what Raboniel had said. Each\nanswer seemed to give rise to a dozen new questions, but Venli knew that\nthe Fused—even one that was in an accommodating mood like Raboniel—\nwould not suffer questions forever. So, Venli settled on one last thing to ask.\n“If Surges are from Honor and Cultivation,” she said, “then why do we\nserve Odium?”\n“A dangerous question,” Raboniel said to Derision. “You truly are the\ndaughter of traitors, aren’t you?”\n“I—”\n“Don’t cover up your ambition, child,” Raboniel said, leading Venli past\na line of snarled shrubs, with little furry creatures scampering underneath in\nthe night. “I like it in my servants. Still, there is a certain silliness to your\nquestion. Which would you rather worship? A god of plants? Or a god of\nemotions?” She waved to the southeast. “Cultivation hides in these"

She is everywhere, but she is also here. Alive, but\nfrightened. She knows. She is not a god of people, but of creatures.\n“And Honor? A god of laws? Again, which would you prefer? A god\nwho knows only how to make a rock fall to the ground? Or a god who\nknows us, understands us, feels as we do? Yes, Surges are bound by Honor.\nYet as you can see, his death did not change the world in any appreciable\nmanner. His power binds all things together, but this alone is not worthy of\nworship. Odium … Passion … he will grant rewards.”\nVenli hummed to Craving.\n“You want more, don’t you?” Raboniel said. “Only one with pure\nambition would stand where you do now. Serve well, and you may find the\nblessings available to the worthy. True knowledge. True life.”\nVenli continued to hum, though her internal rhythm was something far\nmore uncertain. The Rhythm of the Lost. She didn’t know what to make of\nRaboniel. Many Fused were some variety of unhinged: vengeful,\ndestructive, conceited.\nListening to this creature’s careful, insightful offers, Venli found herself\nafraid. This creature was far more dangerous than any she’d encountered\nbefore.\nRaboniel left, striding forward alongside the silent drifting figures of the\nDeepest Ones. Venli continued walking, and was surprised when Rothan\nworked his way up beside her. He was head of Lady Leshwi’s soldiers—not\npart of Venli’s staff, but analogous to her in authority. He, like most of\nLeshwi’s soldiers, had been given to Raboniel for this incursion.\nThe soldiers of the Pursuer had also joined them—and they were a group\nVenli knew by their fearsome reputation. They’d been harsh to the humans\nof Kholinar, but were among the strongest and proudest singer troops, with\ndistinctive uniforms always worn with pride. Now those intermingled with\nLeshwi’s carefully trained and calmer troops, forming a powerful strike\nforce with both strength and discipline.\nVenli hadn’t interacted much with Rothan or the other soldiers, but she\nhad nothing against him. Other than the fact that other Regals made her\nworried, as they held Voidspren in their gemhearts. With each step, his\npowerful figure seemed to crackle with energy. Sparks occasionally flashed\nacross his deep red eyes. She remembered that feeling, holding stormform.\nThe form she’d used when she’d led her people to their doom.\n“You should not bother the Fused, Venli,” Rothan said to Derision,\nlooking toward Raboniel. “Most are not as lenient as Leshwi. Take care. I\nwould not see you fall. You are useful to us.”\n“I … hadn’t noticed that you cared,” she said.\n“Leshwi values you,” he said. “Therefore, so do the rest of us.” He left\nher with that simple warning as he retreated. Rothan didn’t often want\nanswers or even engagement. He simply stood tall, spoke his mind, then\nexpected to be understood."

She couldn’t afford to think about\nrecruitment right now. She had to focus on staying alive. For, as grueling as\nthis hike through the mountains had been, she knew a more dangerous part\nwas coming.\nWithin the week, they would arrive at Urithiru.

The golden-haired\nStoneward still wore her traditional clothing, a wrap around the chest and\nloose, flowing trousers. She claimed she’d picked up scouting skills as a\nguide in the Reshi Isles, but he thought she moved with too much stealth for\nthat.\n“There,” she said, pointing. “They are still following.”\nAdolin raised the spyglass, sighting where she pointed. Indeed, he could\nmake out the Tukari caravan in the distance. Those strange humans had\nbeen following them—never more than a few hours’ march behind—since\nthey’d left the port town weeks earlier.\n“Damnation,” Adolin said. “So they didn’t turn at the crossroads after\nall.” The terrain had grown uneven since this morning, full of crags and\noutcroppings, and it had been more difficult to spot their tail.\n“Wanna go confront them?” Zu asked, grinning.\n“Two on twenty?”\n“One of those two can shape stone at her will and make clothing into\nweapons.”\n“I don’t dare waste what Stormlight remains,” Adolin said.\n“It will run out soon anyway,” she said. “Might as well give it a last\nhurrah! A new experience for the One.”\nFrom below, Ua’pam called up, “Do not encourage her! She will do this\nfoolish thing!”\nZu grinned at Adolin, then winked, as if her bravado were partially just\nto unnerve her spren. Even after weeks traveling with her, Adolin didn’t\nknow what to make of the strange Stoneward. She lightly leaped off the\noutcropping and slid down the smooth obsidian, graceful as an Edgedancer.\nBelow, she slapped Ua’pam on the shoulder and the two of them wandered\ntoward camp.\nHe was tempted to do as Zu said, if only because their Stormlight was\nrunning out. They’d been in Shadesmar almost thirty days at this point, long\nenough that their spheres had all run out weeks ago. Though they’d spent\nmuch of their Stormlight at the caravan stop, they’d retained a few larger\ngemstones lent them by the Thaylens, capable of holding Light longer even\nthan others the same size. Those were starting to dim, unfortunately. And\nonce gems started to dim, they went dun quickly.\nAdolin took another long look at the Tukari, then shook his head.

The latter would have been easy, as\n“night” in Shadesmar wasn’t a strict time set by the movement of the sun.\nThose humans could easily have done a double march and overtaken his\nteam.\nHe’d already sent a runner to ask Notum about them; his smaller patrol\nwas marching a little ahead of Adolin’s group. The honorspren had said that\nit wasn’t illegal for those Tukari to use the road, but to report to him if they\ndid anything expressly threatening.\nAdolin tucked away the spyglass and returned to meet with the others,\nwho were preparing to break camp. He’d learned from his father that a\ncommander was best seen doing things, so he inspected the work, set the\nforward and rear guard for the day, and checked on Maya—who had been\ntraveling on Gallant’s back.\nThe large midnight stallion had taken to her—he wouldn’t let just\nanyone ride him—and seemed to recognize that she was injured somehow.\nGallant stepped extra carefully, moving gently so Maya wouldn’t be\nknocked from her seat. And Adolin was not simply imagining it, no matter\nwhat the others thought.\nHe got everyone moving, then sought out Shallan.\n* * *\nThe last few weeks, Shallan had been of two minds—well, three,\ntechnically—on how to use the information that Beryl was a spy. As the\ncaravan started out for the day, she stuck close to Beryl, ostensibly to help\nher with Lightweaving.\n“I still need to find my focus, Brightness,” Beryl said, keeping pace\neasily with her long Alethi legs. It was almost criminal how luxurious her\ndark hair was, despite there being little water for bathing. “I have tried\ndrawing as you suggest, but I’m not any good at it.”\n“You used Lightweaving with men in the warcamps,” Shallan said. “And\nI’ve seen you use it in sparring.”\n“Yes, but I can’t change anything but my own appearance!” she said. “I\nknow I can do more. I’ve seen the rest of you.”\n“It’s limited for most of us at the start,” Shallan said, nodding toward\nVathah, who was walking alongside the Cryptics. “The first time I caught\nhim Lightweaving, he didn’t believe he’d actually done it. It seems to\nsurprise him each time he makes it happen.”\n“I’ve tried his way,” Beryl said with a grimace. “He acts like the person\nor thing he’s trying to be, and then his Lightweaving takes over. If he wants\nto make an illusion of a large rock, he says he thinks like a rock. How does\nthat even work?” She gave Shallan a weak smile. “I don’t mean to\ncomplain, Brightness. I’m sure I merely have to keep trying. It will come to\nme as it did the others, right?”\n“It will, I promise,” Shallan said. “I was frustrated like you at the start,\nunable to control it.

I swear, either she hides her true emotions marvelously,\nor we have the wrong woman.\nVeil’s surety of that had been growing and building during the trip.\nShallan didn’t want to accept it, but it was hard to continue pretending at\nthis point.\nPerhaps we should speak with Ornament again, Radiant thought. I feel if\nwe chat with her enough, she will let something slip.\nThey’d been trying that too, but … Veil thought they were hitting a dead\nend there. If Beryl’s spren knew about her treason, then the Cryptic wasn’t\nletting on.\nIt twisted Shallan about to consider this all might be for nothing. She\nwanted the spy to be Beryl. And they had a pretty damning confirmation,\ndidn’t they?\nWell, Veil thought, let’s assume the worst. That the real spy is extremely\ncareful and skilled. Is it too much of a stretch to wonder if they discovered,\nby speaking to the others, that we’d seeded a bit of misinformation? Mraize\nis clever. He could have purposely fed us a line to put suspicion on Beryl.\nWhat was the point of the inquiry, then? Shallan thought, frustrated. Why\ngo to all that trouble if we were just going to doubt the results?\nBecause I doubt everything, Veil said. It’s information, but not\nconclusive.\nI agree, Radiant thought. We have had time to investigate Beryl, and\nhave uncovered nothing. To proceed further, we must find proof. Hard proof.\nWe cannot erroneously condemn someone who might be innocent.\nStorms, Veil thought. You sound like a law officer, Radiant.\nI’m agreeing with you!\nYeah, but you hurt my cause when you’re so stiff. Couldn’t you relax now\nand then?\nShallan put her hands to her head, feeling … unsettled. She could\nremember a time not so long ago when her personas hadn’t held arguments\ninside her head. They’d mostly remained isolated; she would shift without\nnoticing. Was it healthier now that they worked together, even if they\nargued? Or was it more dangerous, since the conflict was so difficult? Either\nway, she was growing exhausted of the struggle today.\nSo, reluctantly, Veil took over. And for now she stuck close to Beryl,\ntrying to catch her in a lie. Unfortunately, a short time later, Adolin came\ntromping up. Like an axehound looking for something to chase. However,\neven Veil had to admit that with his floppy hair and his can-do attitude,\nAdolin had a way of making you feel better.\n“Hey,” he said to Veil. “You have a moment?”\n“I suppose,” Veil said. “I’m Veil right now, by the way.”\n“Well, maybe you will have a useful perspective on this,” he said,\nwalking her off from the others to speak in private. “The more I think about\nit, the more I worry we should change how we approach the honorspren.\nNotum was convinced the honorspren wouldn’t talk to us.

She hadn’t forgotten her\nreal duty—that of getting into the fortress and locating Restares, leader of\nthe Sons of Honor. Even Radiant was eager to find this man, to discover\nwhat secrets he held that Mraize wanted so badly. Finding the spy was\nimportant, but this mission superseded it.\n“What if there’s a better way than delivering Father’s and Jasnah’s\nletters?” Adolin said. “What if we offered to give the honorspren as much\nStormlight as they could take, delivered by my father, if they’d only send a\nrepresentative back with us? What if we asked to exchange emissaries, and\npromised to build their representative a fantastic palace in Shadesmar near\nthe Oathgate? We can bring tons of rock in from our side that is extremely\nvaluable here.”\n“Hmmm,” Veil said. “Adolin, they’re like an entire race of spren who act\nlike Radiant does—and they see us as criminals. If we worry they won’t\neven accept some letters and books, wouldn’t it be dangerous to offer\nextremely valuable gifts? They might see those as bribes, or as admissions\nof our guilt.”\n“Maybe,” he said, then punched one fist into the palm of his other hand a\nfew times.\n“I agree with Veil, Brightlord,” Radiant said. “I would be highly\nsuspicious of valuable gifts, if I were them. It is not a payoff they want, but\nisolation.”\n“All right then,” Adolin said. “An entirely different idea. We beg.\nAbjectly. We bow down and say that without them we’re doomed. If the\nspren are anything like Windrunners, then maybe they won’t be able to say\nno.”\nRadiant considered. “Perhaps. I would find that more appealing than\nbribes, I suppose.”\n“I wouldn’t,” Veil said. “But I guess I’m the wrong person to ask.\nBecause at seeing you beg, I’d figure that I was correct to stay out of the\nconflict—because it’s unwinnable.”\n“Damnation,” Adolin said. “I hadn’t thought about that.”\n“Let me consider,” Radiant said. “I am Radiant again, by the way.”\nAdolin nodded.\n“This is a difficult challenge, Adolin,” Radiant finally said. “And I agree\nwith your worries. We have exactly one chance to present ourselves\nproperly to the honorspren. They are a hostile group—indeed, one that has\nself-selected toward hostility. We can surmise that the spren most willing to\nlisten to our arguments have already joined the Knights Radiant.\n“Your ploy of acting weak and begging for help is a promising idea. I\nwonder, however, if appealing to the honorspren’s rational side would be a\nbetter plan.”\n“The way the honorspren insist on turning away from all of humankind\nis emotional though, right?” Adolin said. “They were hurt in the past.

The glittering obsidian hills\novergrown with crystalline plants?\n“You have had a thought?” Radiant asked.\n“Kind of,” Adolin said. “I … realized that they’ll be ready for anything\nwe can bring. I mean, these creatures have been alive for thousands of years\n—and have spent all of that time angry at us. I can’t possibly think of an\nargument they haven’t already considered. I doubt Father, or even Jasnah,\ncould do so.”\n“A reasonable assumption,” Radiant said, nodding as they walked.\n“However, if they are anticipating all arguments, then perhaps the sole hope\nwe have is the skill of the one arguing. Brightness Jasnah can be quite\npersuasive. I suggest, upon reflection, that we continue with the tactic of\noffering the letters.”\n“Either that or we could surprise the honorspren.”\n“How?” Radiant said. “You pointed out they’ve had thousands of years\nto consider these arguments.”\nAdolin shook his head, his expression still distant. “Look,” he eventually\nsaid, “could I speak to Shallan?”\n“Shallan is exhausted at the moment,” Radiant said. “She asks that I\nhandle this conversation. Why do you ask?”\n“I just feel more comfortable with her, Radiant.” He glanced at Radiant.\n“Is … something wrong with Shallan? I thought everything was going\nbetter during the boat ride, but these last few weeks … I don’t know, she\nfeels different. Off.”\nHe noticed! Shallan thought in a panic.\nHe noticed, Veil thought with relief.\n“She has been retreating more and more these days,” Radiant said. “She\nclaims to be tired. But … there is something going on with us. I can try to\nmake her emerge.”\n“Please.”"

I can try to\nmake her emerge.”\n“Please.”\nShe tried. She sincerely did. In the end though, she grimaced. “I’m sorry.\nShallan is tired. Maybe scared. Veil can explain, perhaps.”\n“So … can I talk to her?”\n“You already are,” Veil said, sighing. “Adolin, look. This is really\ncomplicated. It’s wrapped up in Shallan’s past, and the pain she felt as a\nchild. Pain that I was created specifically to help her overcome.”\n“I can help. I can understand.”\n“I barely understand, Adolin,” Veil said. “And I’m living in her head.”\nShe took a deep breath, forcing herself to see him as Shallan did. She loved\nAdolin. She’d chosen Adolin. The least Veil could do was try to explain.\n“All right,” she said. “Pretend you’re her, and you experienced some\nthings that were so traumatic that you don’t want to believe they happened\nto you. So you pretend they happened to someone else. Someone different.”\n“That’s you?” Adolin said.\n“Not exactly,” Veil said. “This is hard to put into words. Radiant and I\nare coping mechanisms that, for the most part, work. But something deeper\nhas started to manifest.\n“Shallan is worried that the person you see in her is a lie. That the person\nyou love is a lie. And it’s not only you. Pattern, Dalinar, Jasnah, Navani—\nshe worries that they all don’t know the real her.\n“Because of things that happened to her—and more, some of the things\nshe was forced to do—she’s beginning to think that ‘Shallan’ is the fake\none, the false identity. That there is a monster deep inside that is her real\nself. She fears it’s inevitable that the truth will come out, and everyone will\nleave her when it does.”\nAdolin nodded, his brow knit. “She couldn’t have told me that, could\nshe?”\n“No.” Indeed, in saying those things, she’d made Shallan retreat into a\nlittle knot of fear. Right next to Formless.\n“You can say things she can’t,” Adolin said. “And that’s why we need\nyou, isn’t it?”\n“Yes.”\n“I think I do understand, a little bit.” He met her eyes. “Thank you, Veil.\nSincerely. I’ll find a way to help. I promise.”\nHuh. She believed him. How interesting. “I was wrong about you,” she\nsaid. “For what it’s worth, I’m glad I was outvoted.”\n“If she’s listening,” he said, “make sure she knows that I don’t care what\nshe did. And tell her I know she’s strong enough to deal with this on her\nown, but she should know she doesn’t have to anymore. Deal with it on her\nown, that is.”\nI wasn’t ever alone, part of her whispered. I had Pattern. Even in the\ndark days of our childhood, we had him.

If only they could persuade Shallan of that fact.\nWe must assume that Odium has realized this, and is seeking a\nsingular, terrible goal: the destruction—and somehow Splintering or\notherwise making impotent—of all Shards other than him.\nThere was more than one way to protect.\nKaladin had always known this, but he hadn’t felt it. Feeling and\nknowing seemed to be the same to his father, but not to Kaladin. Listening\nto descriptions from books was never good enough for him. He had to try\nsomething to understand it.\nHe threw himself into this new challenge: finding a way to help Noril\nand the others in the sanitarium. At his father’s recommendation—then\ninsistence—Kaladin took it slowly, confining his initial efforts to men who\nshared similar symptoms. Battle fatigue, nightmares, persistent melancholy,\nsuicidal tendencies.\nLirin was correct, of course. Kaladin had complained that the ardents\nwere treating all mental disorders the same; he couldn’t swoop in and treat\neach and every person in the entire sanitarium at once. First he needed to\nprove that he could make a difference for these few.\nHe still didn’t know how his father balanced work and emotion. Lirin\ngenuinely seemed to care for his patients, but he could also turn it off. Stop\nthinking about the ones he couldn’t help. Such as the dozens of people\ntrapped in the darkness of the sanitarium, locked away from the sun,\nmoaning to themselves or—in one severe case—writing gibberish all over\nher room using her own feces.\nTemporarily excused from seeing ordinary patients, Kaladin located six\nmen in the sanitarium with similar symptoms. He released them and got\nthem working to support each other. He developed a plan, and showed them\nhow to share in ways that would help.\nToday they sat in seats on the balcony outside his clinic. Warmed by\nmugs of tea, they talked. About their lives. The people they’d lost. The\ndarkness.\nIt was helping. You didn’t need a surgeon or ardent to lead the\ndiscussion; they could do it themselves. Two of the six were mostly quiet,\nbut even they grunted along when others talked about their problems.\n“Remarkable,” Kaladin’s mother said, taking notes as she stood with\nKaladin to the side. “How did you know? Previous documentation indicated\nthat they would feed each other’s melancholy, driving one another to\ndestructive behavior. But these are having the opposite experience.”\n“The squad is stronger than the individual,” Kaladin said. “You simply\nneed to get them pointed in the right direction. Get them to lift the bridge\ntogether…”\nHis mother frowned, glancing up at him.\n“The ardents’ stories about inmates feeding each other’s despair,”\nKaladin said. “They probably came from inmates who were situated next to\none another in the sanitariums. In dark places, where their gloom could run\nrampant … Yes, there I could see them driving each other closer toward\ndeath. It happens sometimes to … to slaves. In a hopeless situation, it’s easy\nto convince one another to give up.”"

In a hopeless situation, it’s easy\nto convince one another to give up.”\nHis mother rested her hand on his arm, and her face looked so sad he had\nto turn away. He didn’t like to talk to her about his past, the years between\nthen and now. During those years she’d lost her loving boy, Kal. That child\nwas dead, long ago buried in crem. At least by the time he’d found her\nagain, Kaladin had become the man he was now. Broken, but mostly\nreforged as a Radiant.\nShe didn’t need to know about those darkest months. They would bring\nher nothing but pain.\n“Anyway,” Kaladin said, nodding toward the group of men, “I suspected\nafter talking to Noril that this would help. It changes something to be able\nto speak to others about your pain. It helps to have others who actually\nunderstand.”\n“I understand,” his mother said. “Your father understands.”\nHe was glad she thought that, wrong though she was. They were\nsympathetic, but they didn’t understand. Better that they didn’t.\nFor the men chatting together softly, the change was in being shown\nsunlight again. In being reminded that the darkness did pass. But perhaps\nmost important, the change was in not merely knowing that you weren’t\nalone—but in feeling it. Realizing that no matter how isolated you thought\nyou were, no matter how often your brain told you terrible things, there\nwere others who understood.\nIt wouldn’t fix everything. But it was a start.\nTo combine powers would change and distort who Odium is. So\ninstead of absorbing others, he destroys them. Since we are all\nessentially infinite, he needs no more power. Destroying and\nSplintering the other Shards would leave Odium as the sole god,\nunchanged and uncorrupted by other influences.\n“I like none of these proposals,” the Stump said, with her spren interpreting\nfor her.\nShe leaned forward to warm her gnarled hands—out of habit most likely,\nas this manifested fire gave very little heat. It could be packed up and\ncarried in your pocket. All you had to do was grab the bead. It was more\nlike a painting of a fire that flickered and crackled like the real thing.\nVeil sat with Shallan’s sketchbook open, her back to a large chunk of\nobsidian, pretending to draw as Adolin held counsel with the Radiants. So\nfar, despite doing the worst job sketching, she hadn’t been able to coax\nShallan out.\n“None of them?” Adolin asked. He stood tall, wearing a black uniform\nembroidered with silver around the cuffs. The polished buttons perfectly\nmatched the silver of the sheathed side sword he wore on his hip.\nHe was striking—brilliant, even, as he stood before the fire in a sharply\ntailored uniform. The fire was cold somehow, though it should have been\nwarm. And he was warm somehow, when a stiff black uniform should have\nmade him seem cold.\nArshqqam, though coming from a very different background, was not\ntimid about speaking her mind to him.

To them this woman—as\nexemplified by her nickname—would be defined by how old she was.\nVeil saw more. The way Arshqqam kept her silver hair carefully braided.\nThe engraved ring she wore on her right hand was her only jewelry, and it\nbore no valuable gemstone, just some milky white quartz. She argued with\nAdolin—one of the most powerful men in the world—as easily as she\nmight have argued with a water bearer. There was so much to this woman,\nand yet they barely knew her.\nDon’t you want to draw that, Shallan? Veil thought. Don’t you want to\ncome out and do a better job than I am?\nInstead, she felt a deep resentment from Shallan. For the things Veil had\nsaid to Adolin. The pain they threatened.\nThe pain of a past best left forgotten.\n“Brightlord,” the Stump said to Adolin through her spren, “I understand\nwhy you are concerned. Dreaming-though-Awake has read the letters\nDalinar and Jasnah sent, then told me the contents. If the honorspren are\ntruly as antagonistic as they seem, then I doubt they will listen to these\nwritten pleas. Dreaming-though-Awake says that honorspren can be quite\npassionate, and would likely respond better to a personal plea.\n“However, the arguments you’ve offered tonight aren’t strong enough.\nClaiming that unless they agree, you’re going to go to the inkspren? They\nknow how badly we need Windrunners, and they undoubtedly know the\ninkspren are being even more difficult to recruit. Trying to play upon their\nguilty consciences to provoke them to help? I don’t think they do feel\nguilty. That’s the problem.”\n“I agree,” Godeke said. The solemn Edgedancer clasped his hands before\nhim, seated on an overturned rations box, his squared beard a reminder of\nhis ardent past. “We can’t guilt them into agreeing, Brightlord. Nor can we\nwin them over with threats. We must present our request: that we are in\nneed, and we sincerely wish them to reconsider their lack of support.”\n“Zu?” Adolin asked the final Radiant.\nThe golden-haired woman leaned back and shrugged. “I’m not one for\npolitics. I’ll tell them they’re being storming stupid if they think they can\nride this.”\n“Your people are trying to ride it,” Godeke said.\n“My people are storming stupid,” Zu said, shrugging again.\nBehind them, the soldiers packed up camp. It was morning—though that\ndidn’t mean much in Shadesmar—and they were now one day away from\nLasting Integrity. It was late in the mission to still be uncertain, and\nAdolin’s worry was making Veil nervous. If their delegation got turned\naway, she’d have to find a way to sneak in and locate Restares alone.\nAdolin looked down, seeming to wilt. He’d spent a good long time\ncoming up with these plans, and Veil had helped him with some.\nUnfortunately, he hadn’t shown much confidence in the ideas, and the\nreactions of the others were further confirmation."

She looked up sharply\nfrom where she’d been sitting behind the others.\n“I … I really don’t know,” she said, glancing back at her feet and\nblushing as everyone turned toward her.\n“You’re a knight,” Radiant said. “At least one in training. This is our\nmission as much as it is that of Highprince Adolin. You should have an\nopinion. Should we present the letters, or should we attempt something\nmore dramatic?”\n“It’s … so outside my realm of experience, Brightness. Please.”\nIt’s not her, Veil thought. It simply can’t be.\n“I’ll work on these ideas some more,” Adolin said. “Beryl, thank you.”\n“Highprince Adolin,” Arshqqam said. “There is something none of these\nproposals do properly that I think you should consider. How can you appeal\nto their honor? Are they not spren of this attribute? I suspect any success we\nhave will relate to that.”\nAdolin nodded slowly, and Radiant cocked her head. Jasnah’s proposal\ntried to do as the Stump said, but Shallan had sensed something off about\nthe arguments.\nHonor, Radiant thought. Yes. Jasnah thinks like a scholar, but not a\nsoldier. There was something wrong about her lofty words and sweeping\nconclusions.\nHonor. How to appeal to the honor of these spren?\nAdolin dismissed everyone to get breakfast. He walked over to take\nanother report from the soldier he had keeping watch over that strange band\nof Tukari humans, who continued keeping pace behind them.\nBeryl stood up, wearing a flowing dress—not a traditional havah, but\nsomething of an older classical style that covered both her hands in\nvoluminous sleeves. She walked up to Radiant, who still sat with her back\nto the rock.\nRadiant quickly snapped closed the sketchbook; it wouldn’t do for\nsomeone to see how terrible Veil’s drawings were.\n“Why did you ask me to come to this meeting, Brightness?” Beryl asked.\n“You have to get used to playing a role in important events. I want you\nto gain experience with the politics of our current problem. Besides, you\nasked to come on this mission when Stargyle proved unavailable.”\n“I wanted to see Shadesmar,” she said. “But Brightness, I’ve barely had\ntime to get used to the idea of being a Lightweaver. I’m no politician.” She\nfolded her arms, and suddenly looked cold as she glanced at the rest of the\ncamp. “I don’t belong here, do I? I’m not ready.”\nRadiant tapped the top of Shallan’s sketchpad with her pencil, trying to\njudge whether this woman was lying. But this was Veil’s area of expertise."

But this was Veil’s area of expertise.\nShe’d spent over a decade being a spy.\nBe careful, Shallan thought. Remember that decade of experience is\nimagined.\nTrue. It was hard to remember.\nYeah … Veil thought. My empty past … being nothing back then …\nunnerves me.\nRadiant didn’t miss noting Shallan’s interjection. That was the most\nthey’d gotten out of her in a few days.\n“Beryl,” Radiant said, “I want you to practice being around important\npeople. You don’t need to solve Adolin’s problems; you just need\nexperience giving your opinion in a place where it’s safe for you to fail.”\n“Yes, Brightness,” she said, relaxing visibly. “Thank you, Brightness.”\nShe bowed and ducked away to go help with breakfast.\nI am not the expert, Radiant thought. But I increasingly agree with Veil’s\nskepticism.\nShallan, lurking deep inside, started to budge. It would be painful to\nacknowledge that one of her friends, instead of Beryl, might actually be the\nspy. But it was better than insisting on believing the lie. No matter how\nexpert they were at that particular trick.\nAdolin walked over. Radiant tucked her sketchbook under her arm as she\nstood up, noting the frown on Adolin’s lips.\n“The Tukari are still back there?” she guessed.\nHe nodded. “They turn away any messenger I send, but they’re\nobviously following us.”\n“We could outrun them,” Radiant said. “It would involve putting the\nStump and Maya on horseback, then pushing hard to reach the stronghold.”\n“Perhaps,” he said. “I kind of need another day to come up with\nsomething.…” He handed her a small bar of crushed lavis held together\nwith sugar.\nA ration bar? She took it with a frown.\n“I thought we’d take a walk,” he said. “While the others eat breakfast. It\nfeels strange to say this, but I feel like we haven’t had any time together\nsince the boat ride.”\nRadiant nodded. Fine with her, though she gave way to Veil—who\nenjoyed conversation more. She tucked her sketchbook into her satchel and\nslung it over her arm. She wore her rugged travel clothing, with the darker\ncoat and a nice solid pair of boots. Ones that fit her far better than the pair\nShallan had stolen from Kaladin.\nAdolin waved to his men, then pointed. They waved back, and he started\nout of camp with Veil following. They didn’t get far before a glowing figure\napproached, riding on something incredible.\nVeil had grown accustomed to the wonders of this place. The way\ngloryspren would sail overhead in formations, or the way that their evening\nconversation last night had drawn a large joyspren—which manifested here\nas a spinning cyclone of color.\nEvery now and then though, something came along that shocked away\neven Veil’s deliberate cynicism.

It had large eyes but\nseemingly no mouth, and its hair waved in a phantom wind, like long\nglowing ribbons. Shallan thought she had never in her life seen something\nso graceful. She didn’t deserve to see something so divine. As if merely by\ngazing at it, she sullied it with the cares of a world that it should never\ntouch.\nNotum pulled up, controlling the grand spren with a simple bridle of\ntwisted threads. “Human prince,” he said to Adolin, “it is here where I must\nturn another way. I am forbidden to approach Lasting Integrity. I’ll patrol\nalong to the south, instead of continuing west.”\nThey’d invited the honorspren to join them, since his patrol had been\ngoing along the coast nearby. He’d refused every invitation.\n“I wish you the best then, Notum,” Adolin said. “It was good to see you\nagain. Thanks for your advice.”\n“I would prefer you take that advice. I assume you have not reconsidered\nyour imprudent quest?”\n“I’ve reconsidered plenty,” Adolin said. “I’m still going to try it though.”\n“As you wish,” Notum said, then saluted. “If I don’t see you after you’re\nturned away, give my best to the Ancient Daughter. It is … well that she is\nnot trapped in the stronghold. It would not suit her.”\nThe honorspren turned to go.\n“Notum,” Adolin called. “That spren you ride. It’s strikingly similar to a\nhorse.”\n“Is that odd?” he asked.\n“Most spren appear nothing like creatures from our world.”\nNotum smiled, a rare expression on the spren’s face, then gestured to\nhimself. “Do we not?”\n“The humanoid ones, yes,” Adolin said. “I’ve never seen one in the\nshape of a horse.”\n“Not all spren were imagined by men, Adolin Kholin,” Notum called to\nhim. “Farewell.”\nAs he turned and rode his graceful animal away, Shallan nearly emerged\nto sketch the thing.\n“Storms,” Adolin said. “He’s so cold, and he’s one of the spren who\nseem to like us. I’m not feeling good about this entire mission.”\n“Maybe I can sneak in,” Veil said. “If they do turn us away.”\n“What would that accomplish?” Adolin asked.\n“I could see if all the honorspren feel the same way, perhaps. Or if there\nare a few tyrants in charge who refuse to listen to reason.”\n“That doesn’t feel like the way spren work, Veil. I have a terrible feeling\nthis is going to go all wrong. And I’ll have come all this way, only to need\nto slink back to Father and tell him I failed. Again.”\n“Through no fault of your own, Adolin.”\n“Father talks about the importance of the journey, Veil, but he’s always\nbeen equally focused on results.

The Blackthorn had an\nenviable reputation, yes, but he’d clearly suffered his own failures—not the\nleast of which had been letting his brother be assassinated. He’d certainly\ndone less to help in that attack than Adolin had in trying to get Elhokar out\nof Kholinar as it fell.\nArguing was, of course, useless. Adolin should know his father’s failings\nbetter than anyone. He wasn’t going to suddenly recognize them because\nVeil said something now.\n“Any luck getting Shallan to come out?” he asked her.\n“I got a thought from her a little earlier,” Veil said. “But other than\nthat … no. I even did a sketch of you. A terrible one, I’ll note. I particularly\nliked the buck teeth.”\nAdolin grunted. And together they continued their walk. He led the way\nthrough a hollow in the obsidian, where the strange rock mimicked a rolling\nwave. The constant sound of clacking beads became a quiet hum as they\nmoved farther from the shore, and Shallan stirred again. The landscape here\nwas so interesting.\nPlants grew like frost here, coating much of the obsidian—and they\ncrackled wherever she and Adolin stepped, breaking and tinkling to dust.\nLarger plants grew like cones, with spirals of color in their translucent skin,\nas if crafted by a master glassblower. She touched one, expecting it to be\nfragile like many other Shadesmar plants, but it was sturdy and thick.\nTiny spren watched them from beneath the leaves of small clumping\ntrees. Jagged lightning branches made of something that wasn’t quite glass\n—for it was too rough to the touch—sprouted silvery leaves that felt\nmetallic and cold. The spren hopped from one branch to another, little more\nthan shadows of swirling smoke with large eyes.\nAnd they move a little like smoke too, Shallan thought. Curling in the\nvectors of heat above a fire, alive like the soul of a flame long extinguished\nremembering its former light …\nVeil normally reviled such poetic nonsense, but sometimes she could see\nthe world as Shallan did. And it became a brighter place. As they passed a\nlarger stand of the trees, Adolin reached down to take her hand and help her\nup onto a ridge. Touching her freehand to his skin made something spark.\nHis touch is a flame never extinguished. Bright and alive, and the only\nsmoke is in his eyes …\nThey walked along the ridge, and she could pick out the camp below,\nwhere the others were packing up their things. Was anyone lingering near\nher trunk?\nThinking of that almost pushed Shallan away to hide again. Veil,\nhowever, had a thought. They needed to leave the device unguarded in a\nnon-suspicious way, then catch who used it. Out here in the caravan, rather\nthan cooped up on the barge, she should be able to make the opportunity\nextremely appealing. She could perhaps pretend to get drunk.

I’m sure of it.”\nVeil glanced away. Feeling like she was intruding.\nHe squeezed her hand. “I know it’s still you, Shallan. That they’re all\nyou. I’m worried though. We’re worried. Veil says you feel like you need to\nhide from me. But you don’t. I won’t leave, no matter what you’ve done.”\n“Shallan is weak,” Shallan whispered. “She needs Veil to protect her.”\n“Was Shallan too weak to save her brothers?” Adolin asked. “To protect\nher family against her own parents?”\nShe squeezed her eyes closed.\nHe pulled her closer. “I don’t know the perfect words, Shallan. I just\nwant you to know that I’m here, and I’m trying.” Then he gestured, leading\nher farther along the ridge.\n“Where are we going?” she asked. “This isn’t some casual stroll, is it?”\n“Ua’pam has walked this caravan route before,” Adolin replied. “He\nmentioned the view up along here is gorgeous.”\nVeil narrowed her eyes, but really, was she going to be suspicious of\nAdolin? She forced her attention back to the spy problem as she followed\nhim, but storms, he was right. The view up here was breathtaking. The\nendless sea of beads reflected distant sunlight from a million different\nspheres. They caught the light, and for a moment she thought the entire\nocean had caught fire.\nHer hand twitched on the strap of her satchel, to reach for her\nsketchbook, but she remained firm and left it alone. Instead she walked with\nAdolin to the end of the ridge where the obsidian rose in a low spire,\novergrown with a type of delicate plant. Flowering blooms that looked\nalmost fungal, though they glowed with their own inner light, red like\nmolten rock.\nI should sketch those.…\nThen, overhead, the strange Shadesmar clouds began to churn. She\ngasped as something emerged from them high above: an incredible beast\nwith an ashen carapace and a long neck. It resembled a greatshell, faintly\nechoing the sinuous look of a chasmfiend, but flew somehow on enormous\ninsect wings—seven sets of them. It trailed clouds behind it, emerging as if\nfrom a shroud of dust. Others clung to its chin, giving it a beard made of\nclouds.\nShe stared as it passed directly overhead, and she noticed sparkling lights\nalong its wings and legs. They glowed beneath its skin or shell—like they\nwere points on a constellation, marking its joints and outline.\n“Ash’s brush of endless paint…” Shallan said. “Adolin, it’s a starspren.\nThat’s a starspren!”\nHe grinned, taking in its majesty.\n“Holy halls!” Shallan said, scrambling to get out her sketchbook. “I have\nto draw it. Hold this.” She handed him her satchel and pulled out the\nsketchbook and charcoal. She could take a Memory—she took several as it\npassed—but she wanted to capture the moment, the grace, the majesty."

She could take a Memory—she took several as it\npassed—but she wanted to capture the moment, the grace, the majesty.\n“You knew,” she said, sitting to better brace the sketchbook.\n“Ua’pam told me,” Adolin said. “There are certain places where you can\nsee them emerge. From other angles they’re invisible. This place is … a\nlittle weird.”\n“A little? Adolin dear, I’m a little weird. This place is downright\nbizarre.”\n“Wonderful, isn’t it?”\nShallan grinned, getting down some sweeping lines of the thing as it\nlanded on a different section of clouds above. A few creationspren peeked\nout of her satchel, little swirling bits of color. When had those hidden in\nthere?\nStorms … she felt as if she could see the starspren’s every detail, though\nit was distant. As it reclined on the cloud, it leaned over—as if looking\nstraight at her. Then it threw its head back, arching its neck, and held the\nposition.\n“Storms!” she said. “It’s posing. Vainglorious spren monster. Here, hand\nme that smaller charcoal pencil. I need to do some detail.”\nHe handed it to her, then settled on the ground beside her. “It’s good to\nsee you drawing.”\n“You knew what this would do to me,” she said. “You deliberately put\nme in a position where I’d have to start sketching. And here I was thinking\nhow ingenuous you are.”\n“I only wanted to see you enjoy yourself,” he said. “You’ve been so\nserious these last few weeks.”\nShe sketched by instinct, absorbing the sight and bleeding it out on the\npaper. It wasn’t a completely automatic process, but it did leave her mind\nfree.\nWhat she found, with barely any effort, left her feeling embarrassed.\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “I just … I’m dealing with some difficult things.”\nHe nodded and didn’t push her. Wonderful man.\n“Veil is really coming around to you lately,” she noted. “And Radiant\nalways liked you.”\n“That’s great,” he said. “I still worry you’ve been … odd these last few\nweeks. And uncommonly unlike yourself.”\n“Veil is part of my self, Adolin. So is Radiant. We have a balance.”\n“Are you sure that’s the right word?”\nShe didn’t particularly want to argue. She’d been Veil more lately\nbecause there was more for Veil to do. In Urithiru, she was Shallan or\nRadiant a much larger portion of the time.\nNevertheless, it was good to … let go. Maybe she ought to break out the\nlast of the wine and force some relaxation into their stomach. The way\nAdolin had been pacing so much, he could probably use a nice diverting\nevening in her arms.\n“I feel like he’s watching me,” Adolin said, gazing up at the majestic\nstarspren.\n“That’s because it is,” Shallan said. “Spren notice when they’re being\nwatched. Recent scholarly reports indicate spren will change based on\ndirect individual perception. Like, you can be in another room and think\nabout the spren, and it will respond.”\n“Now that’s bizarre,” Adolin said."

We’re all strangely normal.\nOr normally strange.”\n“Not my father.”\n“Oh, especially your father. Do you think it’s normal for a person to look\nas if their parentage involved an anvil and an uncommonly stern\nstormcloud?”\n“So … what are you saying about me?”\n“That you take after your mother, obviously.” She drew a bold stroke,\nfinishing off her sketch. She sprayed lacquer on it, then set it aside and\nstarted another one immediately. This was not a one-sketch experience.\nAs soon as she put charcoal to paper, however, she found herself\ndrawing Adolin as he stared up at the sky.\n“How in the world,” she said, “did I get lucky enough to grab you,\nAdolin Kholin? Someone should have snatched you up years ago.”\nHe grinned. “They tried. I ruined it quite spectacularly each time.”\n“At least your first crush didn’t try to kill you.”\n“I recall you saying he tried to avoid killing you, but failed. Something\nabout jam.”\n“Mmm…” she said. “I’m sick enough of rations, I’d probably eat some\njam on Thaylen bread even if it was poisoned.”\n“My first crush didn’t try to kill me,” Adolin said, “but I probably could\nhave died of embarrassment from the interaction.”\nShe leaned forward immediately, opening her eyes wide. “Oooh…”\nHe glanced at her, then blushed. “Storms. I really shouldn’t have said\nanything.”\n“Can’t stop now,” she said, poking him in the side with her foot. “Go on.\nTalk.”\n“I’d rather not.”\n“Tough.” She poked him again. “I can keep going. I’m a storming\nKnight Radiant. I have legendary endurance for annoying people. If I have\nto use up every last gemstone on this fight, I’ll—”\n“Ow,” he said. “Look, it’s not even that good a story. There was this girl,\nIdani, a cousin to the Khal boys. She was … uncommonly well put together\nfor a fourteen-year-old. She was a bit older than I was, and let’s just say she\nunderstood the world better than I did.”\nShallan cocked her head. “What?”\n“Well, she kept talking about how she loved swords. And how I was\nsupposed to have a great sword. And how she wanted to see me wield my\nsword. And…”\n“And what?”\n“I bought her a sword,” he said, shrugging. “As a gift.”\n“Oh Adolin.”\n“I was fourteen!” he said. “What fourteen-year-old understands\ninnuendo? I thought she actually wanted a sword!”\n“What is a girl going to do with a sword? A real one, mind you. This\nconversation could quickly get off track.…”\n“I don’t know!” he said. “I figured she thought they were nifty. Who"

Who\ndoesn’t think they’re nifty?” He rubbed his side, where Shallan had been\npoking him. “It was a really nifty sword, too. Classic antique ulius, the style\nused in lighteyed challenges of honor during the Sunmaker’s reign. Had a\nlittle nick in it from the Velinar/Gulastis duel.”\n“I assume you told poor Idani about all this, at length?”\n“I went on for like an hour,” Adolin admitted. “She finally grew bored\nand drifted off. Didn’t even take her storming gift.” He glanced at Shallan,\nthen grinned. “I got to keep the sword though. Still have it.”\n“Did you ever figure it out? What she was saying?”\n“Eventually,” he said. “But by then … things had changed.”\nShe cocked her head, pausing in her sketch.\n“I overheard her making fun of Renarin to her friends,” Adolin said.\n“She said some … nasty things. That ruined something in me. She was\ngorgeous, Shallan. At the time, my little mind figured she must be the most\ndivine thing that ever walked the land.\n“Then I heard her saying those things. I don’t think I’d ever realized,\nuntil that moment, that a person could be beautiful and ugly at the same\ntime. When you’re a teenage boy, you want the beautiful people to be truly\nbeautiful. It’s hard to see otherwise, stupid as it sounds. I guess I owe her\nfor that.”\n“It’s a lesson a lot of people never learn, Adolin.”\n“I suppose. Thing is, there’s more to it. She was newly moved into the\ncity, and was desperate to find a place. So her joking about Renarin was\ncrass, yes, but she was trying so hard to find acceptance. I don’t see an evil\nchild in her now. The others were unkind to Renarin, and she figured she\ncould bond by doing likewise.”\n“Doesn’t excuse that kind of behavior.”\n“You used to think he was weird too,” Adolin noted.\n“Maybe,” Shallan said, as it was uncomfortably true. “But I came\naround, and I never gossiped about him. It merely took you showing me\nthat while he was weird, it was the good kind. As an expert on weird, I’m\nuniquely qualified to know.” She returned to her sketch of Adolin, focusing\non his eyes. There was so much in his eyes.\n“I don’t excuse the things Idani said,” Adolin said. “I simply feel it’s\nimportant to recognize that she might have had reasons. We all have reasons\nwhy we fail to live up to what we should be.…”\nShallan froze, pencil hovering above the sketchbook page. So. That was\nwhat he was about. “You don’t have to live up to what your father wants\nyou to be, Adolin.”\n“No one ever accomplished anything by being content with who they\nwere, Shallan,” Adolin said. “We accomplish great things by reaching\ntoward who we could become.”\n“As long as it’s what you want to become. Not what someone else thinks\nyou should become.”"

Not what someone else thinks\nyou should become.”\nHe continued staring at the sky, stretched out, somehow making it seem\ncomfortable to be lying with his head on a rock. Wonderfully messy hair,\nblond peppered black, impeccable uniform. And that face in between. Not\nmessy, not impeccable, just … him.\n“It wasn’t long ago,” Adolin said, “that all I wanted was for everyone to\nrespect my father again. We thought he was aging, losing his senses. I\nwanted everyone else to see him as I did. How did I lose that, Shallan? I\nmean, I’m proud of him. He’s becoming someone who deserves love, and\nnot merely respect.\n“But storms, these days I can’t stand to be around him. He’s become\neverything I wanted him to be, and that transformation shoved us apart.”\n“It wasn’t what you found out he’d done? To … her?”\n“That’s part of it,” Adolin admitted. “It hurts. I love him, but can’t yet\nforgive him. I think I will, with time. There’s more though. Straining our\nrelationship. He has this misguided notion that I’ve always been better than\nhim.\n“To Father, I’m some pristine remnant of my mother—this noble little\nstatue who got all of her goodness and none of his coarseness. He doesn’t\nwant me to be me, or even him. He wants me to be this imagined perfect\nchild who was born better than he ever could be.”\n“And that makes you not a person,” Shallan said, nodding. “It erases\nyour ability to make choices or mistakes. Because you’re perfect. You were\nborn to be perfect. So you can never earn anything on your own.”\nHe reached over, putting his hand on her knee, and met her gaze—\nalmost teary-eyed. Because she understood. And storms, she did. She rested\nher hand on his, then pulled him closer. Feeling his breath on her neck as he\ndrew close. She kissed him then, and as she did, she caught a glimpse of the\nsky. The majestic spren had started to fade into the cloud—perhaps feeling\nignored now that her attention was on someone else.\nWell, it wasn’t the spren’s fault.\nIt simply couldn’t compete.\nYou say that the power itself must be treated as separate in our minds\nfrom the Vessel who controls it.\nAdolin walked a little easier, knowing he could get through to Shallan. So,\nafter returning from seeing the starspren, he gave Ua’pam a thumbs-up. It\nhad been an excellent suggestion, and the alone time had been exactly what\nthey needed.\nShallan gave him a fond hug and a squeeze of the arms before hurrying\noff to gather her things. It made sense, he supposed, that she’d been nervous\nlately. A spy had infiltrated their quest here. Perhaps he hadn’t devoted\nenough thought to that particular problem.\nThat was Shallan’s area of expertise though. Illusions, lies, art, and\nfiction. Politics was supposed to be his.

Though Adolin\nhad turned down that very throne when it had been offered to him, he\nshould make a competent emissary to a foreign nation.\nAppeal to their honor, he thought, remembering Arshqqam’s suggestion.\nHe sought out Gallant and took him from the grooms to load the horse’s\nburden himself: the swords in their sheaths, the box of other weapons, then\nthe trunk of clothing on the opposite side. He stared into Gallant’s blue\neyes. Adolin often felt he could see some kind of light deep within them.\n“Must be nice,” Adolin said, patting the horse, “to not have to worry\nabout things like politics or relationships.”\nThe horse snorted in a way that Adolin thought was distinctly dismissive.\nWell, perhaps there was more to complicate a horse’s life than a man could\never see.\nMalli, Felt’s wife, led Maya over. Adolin had asked the scribe to look\nafter Maya while he went on his walk. He gestured toward the Ryshadium.\n“Shall we?”\nIt was hard to get any kind of acknowledgment out of Maya, but he did\nprefer to ask. Indeed, he thought he got a nod out of her. He took it as\npermission, so he helped her up onto the horse. The first few times getting\nher mounted had been a difficult process, involving stepping on some boxes\nand pulling her awkwardly into the saddle. Now she knew what to do,\nthough—and only needed a hand over the saddle to help her into place.\nMaya was heavier than she appeared, made of thick cords that were tight\nand dense, like muscle. Still, even at the start, it had been worth the effort to\nget her into the seat. It made traveling easier, as she would sit placidly on\nthe horse and follow the rest of them. Plus, Adolin admitted that he felt\nbetter with Gallant watching over her. The Ryshadium understood. You took\nspecial care of a soldier who had left part of herself on the battlefield.\nThey started out for the day, Adolin leading the column, though Godeke\nand his spren were scouting ahead. The solemn Edgedancer didn’t have any\nStormlight—they’d used the last of it the previous night, making food\nstores for the trip home—but Godeke had practice scouting as part of his\nRadiant training.\nAdolin spent the early part of the hike trying to settle on a final strategy\nfor approaching the honorspren. The others were right; the ideas he’d\npresented were unlikely to work. So, he’d start with the letters. Could he\ndevelop a backup plan though?\nNothing came to him, and by midday he’d lost any sense of calm or\nsatisfaction he’d gained from the morning with Shallan. With effort, he kept\nhimself from snapping when Felt came up from the rear guard. The foreign\nscout had been a stable, valuable part of the mission so far. Felt might not\nbe quite as spry as he’d once been, but he seemed to have a sixth sense for\ntraveling in unknown places.\n“Brightlord,” the man said, wearing a floppy old hat. He’d inherited that"

He’d inherited that\nwhen Bashin had retired from service, and he now wore it as a memento.\nWhile not regulation, it was the kind of thing you let a man like Felt get\naway with. “The humans just broke and turned away toward the south.\nLooks like they’ve given up on following us.”\n“Really?” Adolin asked. “Now, of all times?”\n“Yeah. Feels strange to me, though I can’t exactly pinpoint why.”\nAdolin gave the call for a break and a snack. Merit approached to unload\nGallant to give him a rest, and Adolin followed Felt to the rear of the small\ncolumn. Here they climbed up a small outcropping of obsidian—fragile\nglass plants crackling and shattering underfoot, lifespren dodging away—\nwhere they could use spyglasses to observe the Tukari.\nThe strange group of humans was now far enough away that he could\nbarely make them out in the dim Shadesmar landscape. They had indeed\nturned southward.\n“Why would they chase us all this way,” Adolin said, “then give up\nnow?”\n“Maybe they weren’t chasing us. They could have simply been going this\ndirection anyway; that would explain why they were always careful to stay\naway from us and not catch up.”\nA valid point—in fact, if the humans hadn’t seemed so unusual to him\nupon their first meeting, Adolin probably would have assumed this all\nalong. He hadn’t thought it odd that Notum was traveling this same way.\nWhy should he have worried so much about these humans?\nThere is something odd about them, he thought. The way they hovered so\nclose, the way they watched us …\nAdolin studied them through the spyglass, though at this distance he\ncould make out little more than the shadows of figures carrying torches.\n“Well, they do appear to be leaving,” he said to Felt, handing back the\nspyglass. “Keep watch while we eat, just in case.”\nAdolin was halfway back to the front of the column when the truth\nstruck him.\n* * *\nVeil closed the top of the trunk with the communication cube, then locked\nit. She couldn’t always rely on the spy to return the cube in a different\norientation after moving it, so—using a trick she’d learned from Tyn long\nago—she’d started dusting it with a faint bit of powder.\nIt hadn’t been disturbed all this trip, so far as she could tell. She needed\nto find a way to use it as bait, leaving it alone in a tempting way. Pondering\nthat, she walked over and took a bowl of mush from Ishnah. Veil braced\nherself to eat the terrible Soulcast stuff. She should force Radiant to take\nover for meals. Soldiers were accustomed to eating terrible rations in the\nfield, right? Radiant would see it as an honor to eat this slop. It would build\ncharacter, and—\nAdolin dashed past.\nRadiant dropped the cup and leaped to her feet.

She took off after him, reflexively trying to\nsummon her Shardblade—which of course didn’t work. Not here in\nShadesmar.\nAdolin scrambled up to the top of the outcropping where Felt was still\nwatching their rear. Radiant started climbing, and was joined by two of\nAdolin’s other soldiers. The rest of the Radiants and agents—even Zu the\nStoneward, who always seemed so eager and excitable—just stood looking\nback with confused expressions.\nAt the top of the outcropping, she found Adolin peering through a\nspyglass, tense and alert.\n“What?” Radiant asked.\n“They weren’t following us,” he said. “Leave a spren or two to watch the\ncamp, then bring everyone else after me! Be ready for a fight.”\nWith that, he leaped off the outcropping. His boots slapped stone below\n—storms, he did remember he wasn’t in Shardplate, didn’t he? Adolin took\noff running toward the distant Tukari caravan, hand on the sheathed sword\nat his belt, holding it in place.\nRadiant stood stunned. Was Adolin going to walk all the way to—\nThe sound of cracking stone thundered from behind. Radiant jumped,\nsearching the nearby formations for some kind of avalanche. Only then did\nshe realize it was the sound of hooves striking obsidian at high speed as\nGallant galloped past. A panicked Maya clung to his mane with a two-fisted\ngrip—but his supplies appeared to have been unloaded.\nBarely breaking stride, Adolin grabbed the dangling reins as Gallant\npulled up beside him. Adolin did an odd running hop, then hoisted himself\ninto the saddle behind Maya, a maneuver that a part of Radiant’s brain\nrefused to believe was possible.\n“Rusts,” Felt said, lowering his spyglass. “How did the beast know? Did\nanyone hear Highprince Adolin whistle for it?”\nThe other soldiers shook their heads.\n“Let’s move!” Radiant said. “Get the packhorses and send outriders to\nfollow him. I’ll have Pattern watch our things. Everyone else get ready to\nmarch!”\nShe had them all going in what she considered an impressively short\namount of time. Three soldiers on horses went chasing after Adolin, but\nthey were far slower than the Ryshadium. Something that large shouldn’t be\nso fast.\nShe marched double-time beside Godeke and Zu, and they outpaced the\nStump and some of the spren. However, while Radiant’s training with\nAdolin over the last twelve months meant she wasn’t soft, she also hadn’t\ndone any forced marches.\nShe’d come to rely on Stormlight. With it, she could have run at a full\ndash without tiring. Godeke could have slid out ahead of them, moving on\nthe stone like it was ice. They didn’t have any Stormlight left, so they\nfollowed as best they could. What was it that Adolin had said? The strange\nhumans hadn’t been following Adolin’s party?

The humans had skirted close, always in\nsight, seeming like they wanted to overtake the group—but never daring.\nThey’d turned away today, heading south.\nThe same direction Notum had gone.\n* * *\nRiding behind Maya as she clung to Gallant’s neck wasn’t particularly\ncomfortable for Adolin. Fortunately, the Ryshadium didn’t need much\ndirection from him.\nAdolin leaned low—gripping the reins, feeling the rhythm of Gallant’s\nhooves pounding the obsidian ground. The Tukari humans had likely\nplanned to jump Notum soon after his patrol left the port town, but had held\noff once Adolin’s group started going the same way. They’d likely worried\nAdolin’s team would come to Notum’s defense.\nThey’d stayed close, never daring to attack. Until at last Notum had\nturned south while Adolin continued west.\nGallant was sweating heavily by the time they approached the humans’\ncaravan. They’d left some people behind with supplies and sent a larger\ngroup after Notum, bearing torches. Adolin ignored the ones guarding the\nsupplies. He leaned lower, one hand around Maya’s waist, hoping he was\nwrong. Hoping this was all about nothing.\nAdolin’s worry mounted as he drew closer. Harsh torchlight. Figures\nshouting.\n“When we get there,” Adolin said to the horse, “stay out of the fight.”\nGallant snorted his disagreement.\n“I’ll need you to get me out,” Adolin said, “and you’ll need to catch your\nbreath to do that.”\nRyshadium were far more than the average warhorse, with speed that\nseemed to defy their grand size. That said, they weren’t built for long\ngallops.\nAnd Adolin wasn’t built for fighting a large group on his own. The others\nwould be far behind. So what was Adolin’s plan? If Notum really was in\ntrouble, Adolin couldn’t very well face ten or more people without his Plate.\nHe drew close, picking out men in thick, patterned Tukari clothing\nholding aloft torches and swords—short one-handed cutlasses with a steep\ncurve to them. Chopping weapons, common sidearms. Only two of the\nenemy had shields, and there was no armor to speak of, though he did spot a\nfew spears that he’d need to keep in mind.\nThey’d stopped in a large circle, surrounding something at their center.\nAdolin gritted his teeth and guided Gallant with his knees to charge in close\nso he could survey better. Spren had been … cagey about whether they\ncould be killed in Shadesmar. He’d seen them carry weapons, and during\nhis earlier trip, Notum’s sailors had admitted that spren could be cut and\nwould feel pain. “Killing” them involved hurting them so much that their\nminds broke and they became something akin to a deadeye.\nStormfather! Adolin caught enough as he rode by; his worst fears were\ntrue. In the center of the group, a glowing figure lay huddled on the ground,\nbound in ropes.

Perhaps they would be next to\nsuffer torture.\nThe assailants didn’t appear to have bows, fortunately, so Gallant made it\npast them without incident. In fact, Adolin was increasingly certain from\ntheir postures and lack of discipline that this was more a mob than a force\nof soldiers. Why would they attack an honorspren? How had they even\ngotten into Shadesmar in the first place?\nAdolin reined in once they were a safe distance away. He’d hoped to\ndraw some of the Tukari away after him, but they remained clustered, a\ngood twenty men with torches, spears, swords. After briefly glancing at\nAdolin, they returned to stabbing at Notum.\nStorms. How long could a spren last under such treatment?\nAdolin checked for help—spotting several figures on horseback\napproaching in the distance—but it would be precious minutes before they\nwere close enough. Jeopardize the mission, or go save Notum on his own?\nJeopardize it how? he thought. You barely know what you’re doing here.\nThe others can deliver some letters.\nYou’re nothing but a uniform and sword, Adolin. Use them.\nHe swung off Gallant. “If this goes poorly, get Maya to the others,” he\ntold the horse. “I’m going to stall those men.”\nGallant blew out again. He was accustomed to riding into combat with\nDalinar.\n“No,” Adolin said. “You’ll get hurt.”\nMaya grabbed his shoulder with a tense hand. She’d spent the ride\nholding tightly to Gallant’s mane, and he sensed terror from her—perhaps\nat moving so quickly. He looked to her scratched-out expression, feeling her\ngrip on his uniform shoulder.\n“If I draw those men off, Maya,” he said, “can you get to Notum and cut\nhim free? You could use one of the swords in the saddle sheaths.”\nHer reply was a low growl, half a whine, and a tightening of her grip on\nhis shoulder.\n“It’s all right,” he said, prying her fingers free. “It’s not your fault. Stay\nhere. Stay safe.”\nAdolin took a deep breath and heaved his greatsword from its scabbard\non Gallant’s shoulder. His swordstaff was back at camp, in the box of\nweapons—along with his shield and helm. So his best option against this\nrabble was the weapon with the best reach.\nHe hefted the massive sword. It was thinner than a Shardblade, but as\nlong as many—and heavier. Many swordsmen he knew looked down on\nthem as inferior to Shardblades, but you could use many of the same sword\nforms—and there was something solid about a greatsword that Adolin had\nalways liked.\nHe strode across the black obsidian ground and started shouting. “Hey!”\nhe said, holding the sword out to the side with both hands. “Hey!”\nThat got their attention. The dark figures moved away from Notum, a\nhuddled form of soft white and blue.\nRight, then, Adolin thought. Stall for time. He didn’t have to defeat all"

He didn’t have to defeat all\ntwenty men here; he only had to last long enough for his soldiers to arrive\nand help even the odds.\nUnfortunately, even if these Tukari weren’t battle-trained, he was at a\nsevere disadvantage. As a young man—his head full of stories of\nShardbearers defeating entire companies on their own—he’d assumed he\ncould easily take on two or three opponents at once in a bout. He’d been\nsorely disabused of this notion. Yes, one man could stand against many with\nproper training—but it was never preferable. It was too easy to get\nsurrounded, too easy to take a strike from behind while you were engaging\nsomeone else.\nUnless your enemy didn’t know what they were doing. Unless they were\nfrightened. Unless you could keep them from pressing their advantage. He\nwouldn’t win here because he outdueled anyone.\nHe’d win because his opponents lost.\n“Hey, let’s talk!” Adolin said. “You’ve got an honorspren there. How\nmuch do you want for him?”\nThey responded in Tukari, and as before—when he’d approached them\nin the camp—their postures were immediately hostile. They advanced on\nhim with their weapons out, bearded faces and thick hair accenting their\ndark expressions. Adolin caught anticipationspren, like enormous lurgs,\nhovering around the outside of the battlefield. Even heard a painspren howl\nin the distance.\n“Don’t suppose you’d agree to fighting one at a time,” Adolin said. “A\nset of friendly duels? I’ll go easy on you, I promise.”\nThey drew closer and closer, just a few feet away now. One spearman\nwas out in front of the others. Spears would be most dangerous; Adolin\nwould have reach against the ones with cutlasses.\n“I guess not,” he said with a sigh.\nThen he launched himself forward, greatsword in a firm two-handed\ngrip. He batted away the first man’s spear thrust, then came in with a wide\npowerful swing and took off the man’s head.\nThat was harder to do than people sometimes thought—even the sharpest\nblade could get caught in muscle or on the spine. Angle was everything, that\nand follow-through.\nIgnoring the gore of the strike, Adolin moved into Flamestance. Fast.\nBrutal. The other Tukari came at him, and Adolin rounded them to the side,\ntrying to keep out of the point of their haphazard formation. His quick\nmotions kept them off balance as they scrambled to try to surround him.\nTraining, fortunately, was on Adolin’s side. He knew how to keep\nmoving, putting as many of them in front of him as possible. Untrained\nsoldiers would move in packs, letting you get around them and keep them\nfrom your back. And they shied away as he made great sweeps with his\nsword, more warding blows than actual attacks.\nAs he dodged around the side, some of them glanced the other way as a\nsoldier at the rear barked an order. That cost them. Adolin crashed into the\npack’s flank, slamming the greatsword into one man’s side, then ripping it"

        "text": "soldier at the rear barked an order. That cost them. Adolin crashed into the\npack’s flank, slamming the greatsword into one man’s side, then ripping it\nfree with a heave and slashing across another’s throat with the backswing.\nHe gutted one more with a lunge—another spearman, his primary goal for\nthis offensive.\nThe men shouted and scattered away in a panic, the man he’d speared\nthrough screaming and stumbling. Even those accustomed to battle could be\nintimidated by the casual brutality of a greatsword at work. Adolin managed\nto catch one final Tukari, who wasn’t quick enough to get away. Adolin\nconnected with a large sweep into the man’s arm.\nThe Tukari howled, dropping his weapon, and Adolin kicked him while\nyanking at the sword—which had gotten caught in the bone. Adolin pulled\nit free with effort and a spray of blood, then did a full-body spin and swept\noutward, making the others leap away in fear. This wasn’t the delicate\nbeautiful dance of a duel—this wasn’t what he loved. This was butchery.\nFortunately, he had some good role models in that realm.\nHis best allies were speed and intimidation. As he’d hoped, these men\nresponded poorly to losing several of their number in such a swift, terrible\nstrike. They shied away instead of pressing their numerical advantage. They\ncried out in shock, anger, and fear as he engaged the next man—isolating\nthis foe in a line between Adolin and the others, so they wouldn’t have a\nclear rush at him. Adolin struck in rapid succession to batter away the man’s\nshield, then cut him down with a strike at the collarbone.\nNot the cleanest kill, that, but the blood on Adolin’s uniform and face\nmust have made him fearsome—for the Tukari scrambled even farther back,\nshouting in their language. Now, unfortunately, came the bad part. Adolin\ntried to keep them frightened by advancing on the nearest man, but they\nrefused to engage him—and kept trying to surround him.\nWhen you were alone in the open, simply keeping from being\nsurrounded was a chore. He had to dedicate all his attention to dancing\nbackward, using sweeps to ward away foes, looking for an opening—but\nconstantly wary of letting anyone get behind him. He could do that, so long\nas he didn’t get tired—but they’d wear him down eventually, and he’d slow.\nHe tried another ploy, moving to Stonestance, a warding posture, trying\nto conserve energy. So long as they were circling him, afraid of him like\nthey might fear a hissing skyeel, it gave more time for the others to arrive.\nThis allowed him to move in close to Notum, who was groaning, his\nbody pierced in a dozen places with wounds that bled a fine, white-blue\nmist. Unfortunately, his bonds were tight—and even if he could get free,\nAdolin doubted he’d be able to run for safety in his condition.\nKeep stalling, Adolin thought, but the enemy was closing in again. He’d\nbrutalized them quickly and efficiently at first—but it was still fourteen on\none, and they seemed to realize he was doomed. They pulled tighter around\nhim, forcing him to keep moving and trying to watch all of them at once."

They pulled tighter around\nhim, forcing him to keep moving and trying to watch all of them at once.\nThere was one man left with a shield, and he shouted orders. Four came\nrunning, two from the left, two from the right. That leader must have had\nsome combat experience—for he didn’t send everyone at once, as a chaotic\njumble would have favored Adolin. Better to have the others wait until he\nwas engaged, then come in and overwhelm him.\nWith a soft curse, Adolin engaged the first pair swiftly, his sole hope\nbeing to fell those two, then get at the two behind. Unfortunately, these\nfront two fought defensively, raising their swords and refusing to fully\nengage him. He was forced to spin and sweep at the two on the other side—\nthen try to come back and keep the front two from taking him.\nHe managed to land a blow, but as he was engaged in keeping from\nbeing surrounded, the leader sent others at him—just running. Storms. He\nhad to dodge to the side to prevent himself from getting knocked over, and\nwhile he cut down two that came running, the resulting chaos was just what\nhe’d feared. They managed to surround him as he was so distracted trying\nto keep from getting knocked down.\nIn the jumble, he ended up getting pressed by two men with swords, who\nforced in so close as he came out of a spin that he had to half-sword his\ngreatsword. That let him get a precision strike at the throat of one of the\nenemies, but left his back open. He heard the boots on stone, and while\nAdolin tried to spin in time, he was too late. The man’s off-center spear\nthrust took Adolin on his right side, near the stomach.\nAdolin grunted at the pain, but managed to get his sword in and batter\nthe spearman away. Damnation. He’d taken exactly the kind of hit he’d\nfeared—an unseen spear while he was overwhelmed. His own blood began\nto stain his uniform; the end had begun. They didn’t have to defeat him in\nsome spectacular duel; they merely had to cut him a few times and let blood\nloss drop him.\nBut if I can just hold on …\nThe howl of a painspren echoed in the distance. Adolin fought off his\nnearest foes, intimidating them backward with a roar and several grand\nsweeps. However, the leader sent in four fresh swordsmen. They’d have\ndone better if they all had spears, but it gave scant advantage to Adolin, as\nhe had to fight wildly—with callous sweeps—to try to keep them all away.\nAdolin was proud that, as one attacker stumbled, he was able to strike at the\nman’s exposed thigh and send him screaming to the ground.\nThe cries of their wounded friend frightened the others for a brief\nmoment, until their captain shouted them back into place. Maybe if Adolin\ncould get at that man, a figure wearing a blue-on-yellow-patterned\novercoat …\nAdolin tried, but two men stepped in to defend the leader. Boots on stone\nbehind made Adolin spin, block, then spin again. All around him, others\ndanced in a strange motion, moving unexpectedly. Adolin was tiring, and it\nwas getting harder and harder to keep them all on one side of him."

Untrained\nsoldiers were far more aggressive, not realizing that they were likely to just\nleave you both dead with those kinds of tactics. Adolin couldn’t watch them\nall, let alone fight them all, and he felt his own doom as he leaped away\nfrom an attack—and his back connected with someone behind him. They\nhad gotten in that close? He braced himself for the blade that would follow.\nInstead he heard a low growl.\nStartled, Adolin glanced over his shoulder to find that the figure he’d run\ninto had put her back to his. Maya had his shortsword out of its sheath, but\nshe held it like a baton, her arm outstretched, sword straight up. Not an\neffective stance—plus, when the enemy drew close, she didn’t swing at\nthem, but merely growled.\n“You shouldn’t have come,” Adolin said, warm blood from his wound\nleaking down his side and leg. He didn’t dare try to stanch it, or he’d leave\nhis hand slippery for the fight. “But thank you.”\nShe growled in return. Gallant approached to the left, completely\ndisobeying orders, but two of the enemy who still had spears noticed and\nbegan forcing him away. The remaining Tukari moved around Adolin and\nMaya, predatory, circling. They seemed concerned about this new arrival,\nthough Adolin wasn’t certain how long that hesitance would last. They’d\nsoon realize she wasn’t much of a threat.\nUnless …\n“Maya!” Adolin said, resetting his stance with arms overhead, holding\nthe sword in a distinctive manner. The way Zahel had taught him to do his\nmorning kata.\nShe glanced at him, and though he couldn’t read her scratched-out eyes,\nsomething changed in her posture. She seemed to understand. She’d done\nthis kata with Adolin every morning out here, and before that he’d done it\nwith her as his sword countless times.\nBlessedly, she moved into the same form, now holding the sword in a\nproper grip, her stance powerful.\n“Go,” he said. He began the kata, and she did likewise. It wasn’t meant\nfor actual fighting, but it looked impressive, sweeping with glistening\nblades.\nThe Tukari leader glanced toward the approaching horses bearing\nAdolin’s soldiers, then barked a command. His men pressed closer to\nAdolin, though they seemed terrified of Maya. And who wouldn’t be? A\ndeadeye, fighting? A couple were distracted by Gallant, who came in\nsnorting.\nMost importantly, Adolin’s biggest disadvantage had been mitigated. He\ndidn’t have to watch his back. Even wounded, warm blood staining his side,\nAdolin felt his confidence surge. Three men came at him, and Adolin stood\nfirm. No. He would not be pushed around.\nNever underestimate the strength of a soldier trained to stand fast.\nHe roared at the men, swinging his greatsword before them, breaking\ntheir charge as they pulled up short.

Yes, a crowd could overwhelm one, and\nsword skill could only hold them back so long. But training was about more\nthan learning to swing a weapon. It was about confidence.\nNever underestimate the simple intimidating force of a man who won’t\nback down.\nThe first came at Adolin with a sword, but hadn’t been caring for his\nweapon. The handguard had come off, so Adolin hacked the man’s fingers\nas they wrapped the hilt of the weapon, dropping them. A foolish mistake; a\ngood swordmaster always taught you to watch your hands. As this man\nscreamed, the other two came in, and Adolin did a full-bodied lunge,\nstretching out the greatsword with a reach that obviously surprised the men\nas Adolin speared right through the stomach of one from a full body-length\naway. Adolin reset, stepping forward and spinning, putting all his weight\nand momentum into the strike that hit the second man. And another head\nwent flying.\nMovement at his side showed two others approaching, but as Adolin\nreturned to his stance and put his back to Maya, they—they scrambled\naway. With their friends dying on the ground before them, these men had\nhad enough. Trembling, they ran away yelling, joined by their friend who\nhad lost his fingers, cradling his bloody hand.\nThe Tukari leader himself came in with one bodyguard as others began\nto scatter. Adolin didn’t retreat a single step as he met the bodyguard,\nsidestepping his lunge.\nNever underestimate the worth of being willing to hold.\nYour.\nGROUND.\nHe shouldered aside the stumbling bodyguard, then swept out and nearly\nmanaged to take the leader’s head—the man dodged just in time, escaping\nwith a gash in his shoulder instead. Thundering sounds made it seem like\nAdolin’s soldiers were close, though it was only Gallant, brilliantly\nstomping loudly and letting out a scream.\nTogether, it was too much for the men. Adolin didn’t win.\nBut the Tukari lost, running toward their supply dump and the safety of\nthe numbers they’d left behind. The leader finally joined them.\nWhen Felt and the others arrived a few minutes later, they found a\nbloodied Adolin propping up Notum—dazed, but alive—surrounded by the\ncorpses of what had once been overwhelming odds against him.\nI find this difficult to do on an intrinsic level, as although I am neither\nRuin nor Preservation, they make up me.\n“I cannot fathom this,” Notum said, staring ahead. He didn’t blink. “I just\ncannot fathom this.”\nRadiant had noticed that quirk in numerous spren in this world; they\nforgot to blink when they were distracted or overwhelmed. She shooed\naway the shockspren who were clustering around the spren, practically\ntrying to climb in his lap. It was so strange for all the spren here to have\nphysical forms; they sometimes had to be pushed away with a weapon.\nAdolin’s soldiers stood in a cluster on a nearby rise, spyglasses to their\neyes, keeping a cautious watch on the enemy caravan.

Shallan’s agents were circumspectly going through the\npockets of the dead, searching for clues to their origins. She spotted Vathah\ndepositing some spheres into his own pouch, and was going to shout at him,\nbut Veil persuaded her to hold her tongue. What else were they going to do?\nLeave the money?\nThe spheres, as expected, were dun. There was no Stormlight here.\nThough Godeke had inspected Adolin’s side wound and given a good\nprognosis, she would rather see him healed. Sepsis could claim any wound,\nbut especially gut wounds.\nIn addition, Radiant suspected Notum could use a little Stormlight.\nThough his wounds had stopped “bleeding,” his glow had dampened\nnoticeably, and his cheery blue-white coloring had become a dull brown-\nwhite.\nHe spoke in a daze. “Why … why would they do this? Humans have\nnever … attacked spren. What would be the point, the use, the purpose?\nThere is no honor in this!”\nHis Reacher companions had been released from their bonds as well. In\nRadiant’s experience, the bronze-colored spren tended to be quiet. These\nthree—one male, two female, wearing simple uniforms—gave no response.\nThey seemed as baffled as Notum.\n“We need to take you to Lasting Integrity,” Adolin said, sitting on a rock\nnearby as Godeke bound his wound.\n“No,” Notum said. “No, I am exiled.”\n“You’re wounded, and we can’t guarantee those humans won’t return the\nmoment we leave you,” Adolin said. “Exile or not, you’re coming with us.”\nNotum glanced from Adolin to Radiant, then looked down. “Your honor\ndoes you credit, Prince Adolin, but you must realize my presence in your\nparty will do you harm. I was exiled precisely because I showed you\nleniency in the past. If I arrive with you now, whatever the reason, it will be\nseen as conspiracy between us.”\n“We’ll deal with that then,” Adolin said, wincing as Godeke pulled his\nbandage tight. “Kelek knows, it’s probably not going to matter—since\nthey’re likely to turn us away regardless.”\n“I wish that were not true, but it is,” Notum said.\nRadiant joined her agents. Ishnah was speaking softly to Beryl, who sat\non the ground nearby, picking through some of the loot. Beryl had thrown\nup several times upon first encountering the corpses, and she still seemed\npallid from the sight, though her tan skin tone made that difficult to read.\n“Make sure you check the insides of rings, the backs of necklaces,”\nIshnah was saying. “Sometimes there are inscriptions with names.”\nBeryl nodded. She kept glancing at the bloodied cloth they’d put over a\ndead Tukari man’s neck stump. She put her hand to her lips, pointedly\nturning away.\nAll right, Shallan admitted, if she’s the Ghostblood, she’s an incredible\nactor. I agree with Veil. We need to rethink our conclusion there.\nAdolin stood up. “Let’s get moving,” he said to the others. “I want more"

We need to rethink our conclusion there.\nAdolin stood up. “Let’s get moving,” he said to the others. “I want more\nspace between us and the rest of those Tukari.”\nIt took a little time to get Notum up on one of the horses, during which\nGodeke—oddly—began moving among the fallen, inspecting their faces.\n“Godeke?” Shallan asked.\n“They’re going to be left out here to rot,” Godeke said quietly. “Those\nothers won’t come back for them.”\n“They tried to kill Notum,” Adolin said. “And me.”\n“I realize this,” Godeke said. “But we don’t know their story. These\ncould be soldiers following orders. They could be confused, mistaking the\nhonorspren for enemies. They could have motives we can’t even guess. I\nwant to remember them. In case no one else does.”\nEdgedancers. Shallan shook her head, then checked on Adolin herself.\nShe poked at his bloodied side. “That’s another uniform you’ve ruined.”\n“Cold water and a soak in salt can get the blood out,” he said. “And I\nbrought my sewing kit. Bet I can have it presentable with a little work.”\n“Still,” she said, resting her head against his chest—careful not to touch\nthe wound. “You need to be careful. We don’t have any Stormlight left to\nheal ourselves.”\n“So … basically it’s how it’s been for most of my life?” Adolin said. He\nrested his hand on her back. “Maybe I did get carried away, Shallan. But it\nwas good to find something I could do. Successfully, I mean. These days it’s\nnot common that I find a place where I’m useful.”\n“Adolin…” She pulled away and studied his face. He was smiling, but\nhis tone wasn’t joking.\n“Sorry,” he said. “That sounded a lot like self-pity, didn’t it? I’m just\ntired. Come on, we really should get going.”\nThat wasn’t the end of the discussion—she’d press him on it later—but\nfor now it was probably best to do as he said. They left the corpses and\ntrudged across the open field of obsidian toward their camp. About halfway\nback, they met the Cryptics—save Pattern—and the Stump with her spren,\nhiking slowly.\nArshqqam took in the sight, then nodded in satisfaction and turned to\nstart hiking back. Fortunately, Notum did seem to be looking better already.\n“Your deadeye,” he said, moving up beside Adolin. “How did you train\nher to fight for you like that?”\nShallan glanced at Maya, who was riding on Adolin’s Ryshadium.\nShallan hadn’t seen it, but she’d heard. The dead spren had picked up a\nsword and fought beside Adolin.\n“I didn’t train her, Notum,” Adolin said. “She chose to help me.”\n“Deadeyes can’t make choices,” Notum said. “They don’t have the\npresence of mind for it. I know this personally. My own father is a deadeye,\ncared for in the fortress now.”"

My own father is a deadeye,\ncared for in the fortress now.”\n“Revise what you know, Notum,” Adolin said. “Maybe something\nchanged once Radiants started returning. Or maybe some deadeyes are\nmore responsive than others.”\n“It simply … it doesn’t make sense…” Notum said, but abandoned the\nargument.\nAt their camp, a perky Pattern was happily waving to them. Shallan\nsmiled at that. No matter what else happened, she could count on Pattern to\nbe his same awkward—yet encouraging—self.\nAdolin didn’t give them time to rest. He ordered the horses watered, but\nsupplies packed up so they could march straight for Lasting Integrity.\nRadiant took over from Shallan again as he gave the commands, and she\nimmediately recognized the wisdom in them. Despite Adolin’s brilliant\nshow of swordplay, their group was quite exposed. Without Stormlight,\nmost of the Radiants barely counted as warriors. Adolin was wounded, and\nNotum struggled to remain upright. If the Tukari regrouped and decided to\ncharge them … Well, best to remove the option and push—difficult as it\nwould be—to reach the honorspren stronghold before the day was done.\nVeil checked with Vathah and Ishnah about the corpses they’d searched.\nThe pilfering had been quick, and their findings slim. A few cloth bracelets\nhad patterns Ishnah said she thought were Tukari clan writing.\nAfter that Radiant checked with Pattern, but nothing unusual had\nhappened while they were gone. Finally, as their supplies were being loaded\nonto the packhorses, Shallan took over and moved to check on Mraize’s\ncommunication cube out of habit. Shallan unlocked the trunk and popped it\nopen, then gave a quick glance inside. She didn’t expect …\nThe powder had been disturbed.\nSuppressing her immediate shock, Shallan took a Memory, then shut the\ntrunk and clicked the lock closed. She moved by rote, letting one of the\nsoldiers load it on a horse. Then she stood there, stunned. The powder had\nbeen brushed faintly by fingers; she could visualize it distinctly. It had been\nreturned in the right orientation, but Veil’s trick with the powder revealed\nthe truth.\nHow … She’d checked it earlier. Just before they’d all run off after\nAdolin. But then she’d left the camp under the watch of …\nOf Pattern.\n“Mmmm…” he said, making Shallan jump as she noticed him standing\nright behind her. “An eventful day with humans! Your lives are always so\nexciting. Mmm…”\n“Pattern,” Veil said, “nothing happened here while we were gone. You\nare sure?”\n“Yes, very sure. Ha ha. You had excitement, and I was bored. It is irony!\nHa ha.”\nVeil, this can’t … this can’t be possible, Shallan thought. We can’t be\nsuspicious of Pattern of all people.

And she’d told him about the\norientation issue with the cube, so it was no wonder that this time—in using\nit—the spy had returned it exactly the right way.\nRadiant wasn’t convinced. And … it was ridiculous, wasn’t it? To think\nPattern could be spying on her for the Ghostbloods? He loved lies, but she\ndoubted he could manage one himself. At least not one that would fool Veil.\nShallan took over, and tried to put the idea out of her mind as they began\nwalking. But it wouldn’t leave her alone. Veil and even Radiant began to\nwonder. He’d had opportunity. He knew about the communication cube,\nand had been watching over it the night she’d been drunk.\nShallan’s father had belonged to the Ghostbloods; her family had been\ninvolved with them all the way back in her youth. Perhaps in her childhood,\nduring those shadowy days she’d forgotten? Could the conspiracy go back\nthat far?\nHer association with Pattern stretched back to that time, for certain.\nShe’d used him as a Blade to kill her mother. Shallan had suppressed many\nof those memories, but this fact was indisputable. Pattern and she had\nbegun to bond nearly a decade ago.\nCould Pattern have been working with them all along? Feeding them\ninformation about her progress? Leading her to contact them when she’d\nfirst come to the warcamps?\nThe implications of that shook her to the core. If her spren was a spy …\ncould she trust anything?\nCould she even keep going? This revelation was far, far worse than\ndiscovering Vathah or Ishnah had been the spy. This … this made her\ntremble. Made her legs weak.\nShallan, Radiant thought. Be strong. We don’t know all the facts yet.\nNo. No, she couldn’t be strong. Not in the face of this.\nShe crawled away, deep within, and started whimpering like a child.\nSomething was odd about Pattern, about his interactions with her all along.\nThe way he covered up what happened in the past. The timeline of her\npast … disregarding the holes in it … didn’t quite work. It never had\nworked.…\nStrength, Shallan, Veil thought.\nTake over, Shallan thought. You can face this. It’s why you were created.\nTry to keep going, Veil thought, refusing to take over. Just keep walking.\nYou can do this.\nSo Shallan reluctantly maintained control. When Adolin called a brief\nbreak two hours later, Shallan forced herself to make a quick sketch of the\ncommunication cube in its trunk. The Memory was perfect, and the details\ndid not lie. The powder had been scuffed with finger marks. It was a very,\nvery thin coating, almost invisible. But her Lightweaver ability allowed her\nto memorize such details.\nShallan tried hard to ignore the problem, instead focusing on their\nsurroundings, which had grown more uneven and rocky. The glass trees\nhere were beautiful, like they were molten liquid, and made sweeping curls\nreminiscent of crashing waves. Yes, focus on those.

That makes sense, I suppose!” he said. “I don’t remember much\nthough.”\n“You were together once, in the garden, with Shallan,” Veil said—\nfabricating a complete lie. “I can see her memories. Shallan saw Balat\nspeaking to someone who looked, in hindsight, like she might have been\nwearing a mask. Do you suppose he might be the spy?”\n“Oh!” Pattern said. “Your brother? Working with the Ghostbloods?\nHmmm … That would be painful for you! But maybe it makes sense.\nMraize always does seem to know too much about your brothers and where\nthey are.”\n“Do you remember that day in Shallan’s past?” Veil pushed. “Anything\nabout it?”\n“In the garden, with Balat meeting someone wearing a mask…” Pattern\nsaid.\n“An important moment,” Veil said. “You were there. I can remember you\nbeing with Shallan.”\n“Um … Yes!” he said. “I remember now. Ha ha. Yes, that happened.\nBalat and a mysterious figure. You have made my memory start to return,\nVeil! We were together then. And maybe Balat is a spy. My my. That is very\nnaughty of him.”\nFrom deep inside, Shallan whimpered again. But Veil, Veil had been\ncreated to soldier through moments like this. She ignored the profound\nsickening feeling. Pattern was lying to her.\nPattern was lying.\nVeil couldn’t take anything for granted any longer. She couldn’t assume\nanyone was trustworthy. She had to be careful, redouble her defenses, and\nkeep Shallan safe.\n“Veil?” Pattern asked. “Are you well? Did I say something wrong?”\n“I’m merely thinking,” Veil said. “Have you seen any strange spren\nwatching us?”\n“The corrupted gloryspren?” he asked. “Like you said to watch out for?\nNo, I have not.

The honorspren had seen them approaching, and had sent a\ncontingent to engage them.\nAdolin halted the column, dismounting and telling his soldiers to water\nthe horses and settle everyone. Then he stepped forward, still wearing the\nbloodied uniform, his side bandaged.\nVeil moved to follow. “Keep your eyes—or whatever it is you have—\nopen,” she said to Pattern as he ambled along beside her. “These are\ndangerous times, Pattern. We have to always be on the watch. Careful, lest\nwe be taken advantage of…”\n“Yes, truly.”\nShallan grew very small, very quiet. It’s all right, Veil thought. I’ll figure\nit out. I’ll find a way to keep you safe. I promise.\n* * *\nAdolin stopped in front of his caravan, Shallan at his side. The pain\nmedication he’d taken was working, and he felt only a small ache from his\ngut wound. And the march here—during which he’d admitted he needed to\nride, letting him rest—had helped with his light-headedness.\nHe still required sleep and time to recover. This wound wouldn’t be\ndebilitating, unless it started to rot. But he also wouldn’t be in fighting\nshape for weeks at least.\nFor now, he kept a strong front. He had Notum stay back, though he was\ncertain the three approaching honorspren had seen him. They rode on those\nsame graceful not-horses that Notum had been riding earlier. His had run\noff in a panic when he’d been attacked, and they hadn’t been able to locate\nit.\nThese newcomers wore sharp field uniforms after an unfamiliar style—\nlong sweeping coats that trailed almost to the knees, with high collars. They\nwore crowns on their heads, and carried long swords at their sides, slim and\nbeautiful. The swords were the only things they wore that weren’t made of\ntheir own substance—coats, crowns, shirts, all were simply created by the\nhonorspren.\nA woman at the front had the highest collar of the three. She wore her\nhair up, tight save for one small tail of it pouring out the back. That, like the\nuniforms, was a fashion style unfamiliar to Adolin.\nShe pulled her not-horse to a halt about five paces from him. “Human,”\nshe said. “You’ve been recognized by our scouts. Are you Adolin Kholin, as\nwe have surmised?”\n“Your intelligence is good,” he said to her, hand resting on his sheathed\nsword. “I’ve come by order of the Bondsmith, my father, to visit your lands\nand deliver a message on his behalf. I bring with me Knights Radiant of\nfour different orders, all of whom work in concert against the rising\nEverstorm. Proof that men and spren once again need their bonds of old.”\n“Lasting Integrity is not accepting visitors or emissaries, regardless of\ntheir pedigree,” the woman said, her tone sharp, each word a barked order.\n“You are to leave. We are not interested in bonds with murderers and\ntraitors.”\nAdolin took out the letters he’d been given, proffering them. He waited,"

        "text": "“You are to leave. We are not interested in bonds with murderers and\ntraitors.”\nAdolin took out the letters he’d been given, proffering them. He waited,\nsweating, hoping. One of the honorspren urged its mount forward, then took\nthe letters.\nAdolin felt a wave of relief as the honorspren returned to the other two.\n“Those letters explain our position,” Adolin said. “My father hopes that we\ncan forge a new—”\nHe was interrupted as the spren deliberately ripped the letters in half.\n“We will not accept,” the woman said, “a contract from you.”\n“It’s not a contract!” Adolin said, stepping forward, ignoring a spike of\npain from his side. “They’re just letters! At least read them!”\n“By reading these, we imply there is an argument you could make to\npersuade us,” the woman said as the other honorspren further shredded the\nletters. “You will withdraw from these lands and take with you the traitor\nNotum. Inform him that we now know his complicities run deeper than\nanticipated. His exile is complete.”\nAdolin gritted his teeth. “He was attacked,” he said. “Nearly killed\nbefore we could get there! The world is changing. Barricading yourselves in\nyour fortress won’t stop the change, but it might leave you completely\nwithout allies when you finally realize you need to do something!”\nThe honorspren unsheathed her sword and pointed it at him. “This is our\nrealm. Our sovereign land. So you will leave as ordered. Humans never\nrespect that, never accept that spren can own anything. We are possessions\nto you.”\n“I don’t—”\n“You will leave,” she said. “We reject your offer! We reject your bonds!”\nAdolin took a deep breath, each of his arguments dying like shriveled\nplants starved for rainwater. Until only one dangerous possibility remained.\nA plan he had barely dared consider, let alone suggest to the others.\nWhen he spoke, it was with the same brashness—but the same sense of\ninstinctive rightness—that had led him to attack Sadeas. “You mistake me!”\nhe snapped at the honorspren. “I didn’t come to offer you bonds with\nRadiants.”\n“What, then?” she demanded.\n“I’ve come,” Adolin said, “to face your judgment. You’ve named us\nmurderers, traitors. I reject this, and vow to prove it. Take me, as a\nrepresentative of the Kholin house and the new government of Urithiru. I\nam a highprince of Alethkar and the son of the Bondsmith. I will stand in\nthe place of those humans whom you say betrayed you. You wish to reject\nus because of what they did? Prove, through judgment, that I deserve this\ntreatment.”\nThe lead honorspren fell silent, then she leaned to the side and whispered\nquickly to her companions. They seemed equally baffled. Behind, Shallan\ntook Adolin by the arm on his good side, her face concerned.\nHe stood firm. Not because he was confident, but because he was angry.\nThey wanted to call him a traitor? They wanted to blame him for what had\nbeen done to Maya? Well, they were honorspren. He suspected they"

He suspected they\nwouldn’t be able to resist a chance to formally defend their honor—as they\nsaw it.\n“You would stand trial?” the honorspren said at last. “For your\nancestors?”\n“I will stand trial for myself. In turning me away, you insult my sense of\ndignity, my integrity. You say I am not worthy, when you do not know me?”\n“We know humans,” one said.\n“I reject that argument. Honor demands you let me speak for myself, if\nyou are going to punish me. Where is the trial? Where is the chance for me\nto speak? Where is your honor?”\nThis provoked a reaction at last. The three began looking at one another.\n“You are honorspren, are you not?” Adolin said. “You believe in justice?\nIn fairness? Let’s see if you can uphold those ideals while blaming me for\nwhat was done in the past. Let me speak for myself. Then prove that I,\nAdolin Kholin, deserve to be turned away.”\nFinally the leader sat up straight in her saddle. “Very well. We cannot\nreject a demand for judgment. Come with us. Know that if you enter\nLasting Integrity, there is little chance of you ever leaving.”\n“We shall see,” Adolin said, then turned and waved to beckon the others.\n“No,” the honorspren said. “Just you.”\n“My party has traveled far,” Adolin said, “and they include\nrepresentatives of—”\n“You may bring two others,” the honorspren said. “And that deadeye.\nYou have bound her corpse, haven’t you, human? You’re not one of these\nnew Radiants? Or have you already killed your spren?”\n“I’m not a Radiant,” Adolin said. “But yes, Maya is my Blade.”\n“Then we must be certain you are not mistreating her,” the honorspren\nsaid. “We care for all deadeyes. Bring her, and two others. Decide quickly.”\nAdolin ground his teeth. “Allow me to confer.”\nAs he and Shallan returned to the others, she seized him by the arm.\n“What are you doing?” she demanded. “You can’t stand trial for what a\nbunch of people did thousands of years ago.”\n“I will if it gets us in those gates,” Adolin said. “Do we have a choice?”\n“Yes,” she said. “We could turn back.”\nAnd face my father, having failed him again?\nThe others gathered around him. Adolin explained what was happening,\nthe Stump’s spren translating for her.\n“I don’t like this,” Zu said, shaking her head, her golden hair\nshimmering. “I don’t like splitting us up.”\n“The first step to completing this mission is getting the honorspren to\ntalk to me,” Adolin said. “If they turn us away here, we’re done. If I can get\nthrough those gates, I can maybe start a conversation.”\n“They’re not going to listen to you, Brightlord,” Godeke said. “They’re\ngoing to arrest you.”\n“If it gets me in, I don’t particularly care.

The rest can camp out here\nfor a few days, care for Notum, and wait for word from me. We have a few\nweeks until supplies make it necessary for you to return; we’ll decide what\nto do then.”\nThe others offered a few more token objections. Shallan—actually, she\nseemed like Veil right now—merely listened as Adolin persuaded the\nothers. She plainly knew he would take her in with him, as well as her\nspren. It seemed the natural choice.\nA short time later he approached the honorspren—leading Gallant, with\nMaya on his back—along with Veil, Pattern, and their trunks of clothing on\npack animals. The honorspren spun about, then led them to the front of the\nfortress. There, they conferred with a few others who stood guard outside\nthe walls.\nThen the gates opened. Adolin strode in, accompanied by Veil, Pattern,\nand Maya. He grunted at the pain from his wounded side as a group of\nglowing blue-white figures immediately seized him and slapped his wrists\nin chains. The gates swung shut behind them with a booming sound.\nSo be it. He was not going to return to his father empty-handed. He\nwould not abandon his mission.\nNo matter the cost.\nRegardless, I will try to do as you suggest. However, you seem more\nafraid of the Vessel. I warn you that this is a flaw in your\nunderstanding.\nWeeks after destroying the spanreed, Navani still hadn’t made headway\ndiscovering the nature of the spren who had contacted them. Their\ntriangulation of the spanreed had led them to a strange dark location on the\nfourth floor of the tower, near a monastery. The measurements hadn’t been\nprecise enough to tell them exactly where, and searches had revealed\nnothing.\nNevertheless, Navani had plenty of other things to occupy her. Running\na kingdom—even one consisting of a single enormous city—was a\nwearying task.\nShe rarely got a break from the demands of merchants, lighteyes,\nardents, and the thousands of others who needed her attention. Whenever\nshe did, she retreated to the basement of the tower, where she could peek in\non the efforts of her scholars. Today she could spare only an hour—but she\nwanted to make the most of it.\nAs soon as she entered, Tomor—the young relative of Falilar—ran over\nand intercepted her, carrying a strange device. “Brightness!” he said, with a\nquick bow. “You’re here! See, it’s finally done!”\nTomor held up a device that resembled a leather glove. He was working\non that lifting fabrial, she remembered. I told him to connect it to those\nweights in the deep shaft. She was still excited by that prospect: the idea of\nusing the power of the storms to wind up weights, then activate them with a\nfabrial to raise a lift.\nThis lifting fabrial was only a small part of that larger, more important\ndevice. Navani took the fabrial from him, hesitant. “You … made it into a\nglove?”\n“Yes, like you asked!” Tomor said."

Navani took the fabrial from him, hesitant. “You … made it into a\nglove?”\n“Yes, like you asked!” Tomor said.\n“I didn’t ask for a glove,” Navani said. “I wanted the device to be more\nportable and elegant.”\n“Like … a glove?” he said.\n“It’s intended to be mounted to a lift, Ardent Tomor,” Navani said. “I\ndon’t see how this shape enhances its function.”\n“But with this, you don’t need a lift!” he explained with enthusiasm.\n“Look, here, put it on!”\nHe nodded eagerly as Navani fit the device over her hand and wrist, then\nhad Tomor tie the straps to brace it up to her elbow. Made of stiff leather, it\nwas almost more a gauntlet than a glove. The gemstones were hidden in a\ncompartment at the side, affixed with metal caging that could be covered\nover with another piece of leather.\n“See, see!” Tomor said. “You can conjoin different fabrials with this dial\non the side of the index finger. You can move it with your thumb, allowing\nsingle-handed manipulation! By making a fist, you can slow the unwinding\nof the weight! Open palm, you go at maximum speed. Closed fist, you\nstop!”\n“Maximum speed…” It registered what he was saying. He expected\npeople to rise through the central shaft of the tower being pulled by their\nhand. It was a wildly imaginative application of what she’d wanted—and\nalso a terrible design.\n“Tomor,” Navani said, trying to find a way to explain without dampening\nhis enthusiasm. “Don’t you think this might be a little dangerous? We\nshould be designing lifts.”\n“But we already have fabrials for that!” he said. “Think of the flexibility\nthis would allow Brightlord Dalinar. Wearing this gauntlet, he could go zip\nall the way to the top without needing to wait for a lift! Walking outside the\ntower, and don’t want to go all the way to the central shaft to catch a lift?\nNo problem. Zip! All the way up high.”\nShe tried to imagine Dalinar dangling in the sky after going “zip”\nbecause he activated this insane device, and couldn’t help smiling. If her\nhusband wanted, he could have a Windrunner fly him up—but he never did.\nAs efficient as that sounded, it really wasn’t worth the hassle and\ninconvenience, rather than simply riding a lift like everyone else.\n“It’s a wonderfully creative design, Tomor,” she said. “I sometimes miss\nthe flexibility of a young mind—it truly does lead one to explore paths that\nwe, in our aged wisdom, never think to notice. You’ve done well here.”\nHe beamed. Now, if she could get him to do what she’d actually asked—\n“Try it!” he said.\nTry it. Oh dear. She glanced at his animated smile, and didn’t miss\nKristir—the head scholar on duty today—passing behind, hiding her own\nsmile with a stack of papers as she walked. The other scholars in the room\npretended to be busy amid their logicspren, but Navani could feel their\neyes.\n“I assume,” she said to Tomor, “you’ve tested this yourself.”\n“Yes!” he said. “I’ve been doing it in here for days!”"

Navani gave him a polite smile, then\ninspected the controls. Yes … so this fabrial held several separate rubies,\neach attached to a distant weight. You pointed the glove in the direction you\nwanted to go—presumably up, but it could move you laterally as well—\nthen conjoined one of the rubies. Then you unhooked the weight with a\ndifferent control, and the glove pulled you along—using the force of the\nfalling weight.\nShe took a deep breath, then raised her hand in the air.\n“Be sure to make a fist first!” Tomor said.\nShe did so, then conjoined the device. The glove locked into place. She\nreleased one of the distant weights, then carefully relaxed her fist, and the\ndistant weight slowly moved down.\nNavani went up. Pulled somewhat uncomfortably by her arm, she rose\nseveral feet into the air. Tomor let out a whoop, and a number of the\nwatching scribes applauded.\nNavani tightened her fist, halting her ascent. She floated there, dangling\nby her arm roughly four feet in the air, her fist nearly touching the ceiling.\n“See!” Tomor said. “See!”\n“And … exactly how does one get down, Tomor?” she asked.\n“Um…” He ran to the side and grabbed a large stepstool by the wall.\n“I’ve been using this.…”\nHe placed it for her, and—thankfully—she was allowed to deactivate the\ndevice. She dropped a few inches onto the stepstool to further applause.\nNow they were just baiting her.\nStill, Tomor was sincere. And maybe there could be some use for this\ndevice. If someone needed to reach a flying ship that had already taken off,\nfor example.\n“I like it,” she told Tomor. “It’s a little hard on the shoulder though. I\nwonder if it would be better as some kind of belt, instead of a glove.”\n“A belt…” he said, eyes opening wide. “A flying belt.”\n“Well, a levitating belt,” Navani said, unstrapping the device. “Our\nfabrials still have the problem that they can only move in one direction at a\ntime.”\n“Yes, but with two belts,” he said, “you could fly up high, then shoot off\ninto the distance!”\n“Only until the weight hits the bottom of the shaft and you stop moving,”\nNavani said. “Unless we want to use an entire chull rig with dozens of\nattendants to keep you going, like we do with the Fourth Bridge.”\n“Hmm,” Tomor said. “So many knots to untangle…”\n“I also suggest,” Navani said before he could get distracted by the belt\nidea, “changing the method of speeding up and slowing down. It is more\nnatural to open your fist when surprised, I think, so that should halt the\ndevice. Make it so that there is a bar—like a throttle for opening a pressure\nvalve—across the hand. Squeeze it to get speed.”\n“Right, right…” He sat and began sketching. “I’ll keep it as a gauntlet"

She was short of stature, but\nnot of personality, and bore a smile on her rosy cheeks. Navani leaned in to\nwhisper, “You enjoyed that, didn’t you?”\n“We’ve had a pool going on whether you would actually try it out,\nBrightness,” Kristir whispered. “I won seven clearmarks.” She grinned.\n“You want me to point him back at making a lift, like he was supposed to be\ndoing?”\n“No,” Navani said. “Encourage him to keep going in this direction. I’d\nlike to see what he comes up with.”\n“Understood—though it would help us all immeasurably if you could\nbreak the altitude/lateral movement exclusivity problem for us.”\n“It will take a better mind than mine to do that, Kristir,” Navani said.\n“Put our best mathematicians on it—but not Rushu. I have her thinking\nabout how to protect the tower from—”\nA shout came from outside the room. Navani turned and strode toward\nthe door—but was stopped by a young soldier with his hand out toward her.\nHe waved for the room’s guards to check the noise first. “Sorry,\nBrightness,” he said. “The Blackthorn would have my spheres if I let\nanything happen to you.”\n“I’m pretty sure I know what this is, Lieutenant,” she said, but folded her\narms and waited. The gathered scholars in the room behind her murmured\nin concerned tones. Navani peeked out into the hallway, where a couple of\nsoldiers—men she’d assigned to Kalami’s investigation—were holding a\nstruggling figure, surrounded by fearspren. Hopefully this wasn’t a false\nalarm.\n“What is it?” the lieutenant asked as one of his guards jogged over.\n“Not sure,” he said. “Those men say they’re working at Brightness\nNavani’s request.”\n“I apologize, Brightness,” the lieutenant said, stepping back. He let her\npass, though his soldiers maintained close proximity to her as she stepped\ninto the hallway.\nThe man they’d captured was a wiry fellow, Alethi, but with skin on the\npaler side. He searched about, wild-eyed, struggling but not saying\nanything.\nThe bait had been her workstation, which she’d set up unoccupied across\nthe hall, in the room used mostly for storing books and as a quiet reading\nnook. Her station there had been a tempting prospect, easy to reach from the\ndoor, and mostly ignored this last week.\nChananar—one of the soldiers she’d had secretly watching the\nworkstation—stepped over to her and proffered half of a small ruby,\nilluminated faintly by the light of the spren trapped inside.

Speak, man. You’re in some serious trouble—but I will be\nlenient if you cooperate.”\nThe man trembled, but said nothing. The ruby started flashing in\nNavani’s fingers, indicating the phantom spren wished to talk with her. It\nmight be a distraction, but in any case, she wanted to be in the presence of a\nLightweaver when she replied this time—they had the ability to see spren in\nShadesmar even when they were invisible to others.\n“Bring him,” she said to the soldiers. “We’re going to my audience\nchamber for a proper interrogation. Isabi, please write to Kalami and have\nher meet me there.”\nThe young ward—who was among the increasingly large crowd of\ngawking scholars—hurried off.

He’s with\nthe Radiants.”\n“A squire?” Navani asked, surprised.\n“More a servant, Brightness. He was there helping with meals when I\ntried out for the Windrunners last month.”\nWell, that would explain how he’d gotten into her traveling sphere to\nplace the first gemstone—the Windrunners often practiced with it, training\nto keep the device in the air. Was she wrong about her phantom spren\ncorrespondent? Was it possible they were an honorspren? Many of those did\nhave a somewhat antagonistic relationship with the current Knights\nRadiant. She tucked the blinking gemstone away in her glove’s wrist pouch.\nYou can wait, she thought to the phantom spren. I’m in control of this\nconversation now.\nUnfortunately, as she was leaving, Navani noticed Isabi taking a message\nfrom one of her spanreeds and looking anxious.

They were far, far below the tower. From\nthis angle, she couldn’t see the city. Perhaps it was above the black clouds.\nIf so … storms. Until this moment, she hadn’t been able to fully conceive of\nsomething inhabitable being built so far up.\nOne of the Deepest Ones glided toward Venli and Raboniel, her feet\nsunken in rock. She moved with an unnatural grace, as if her bones weren’t\ncompletely solid. This was the scout Raboniel had sent ahead this morning\nto search for a proper incursion point.\n“Come,” she said to Command.\nVenli followed, joining Raboniel, Rothan, three Deepest Ones, and a\nsoldier she didn’t know. Raboniel didn’t forbid Venli, and none of the others\nseemed to care that she was there. They made their way around the side of\nthe mountain, passing a pile of what looked like rotting grain and some\nbroken wood boxes. Did humans travel this way?\nNo, she realized. This must have fallen from above. Perhaps a shipment\nof food, coming via Oathgate to the city.\n“Here,” the Deepest One said, bringing out a Stormlight sphere to light a\nparticular patch of rock. She then sank her hand into the stone as if it were\nliquid. Or … no, that wasn’t exactly correct. When the Deepest One put her\nhand into the ground, she didn’t displace anything, and the stone seemed to\nmeld to her skin."

How\ncould they allow this oversight?”\n“These new Radiants know nothing,” another Deepest One said to\nCraving. “Raboniel, Lady of Wishes, you are correct in pushing to strike\nnow. Yours is wisdom that the Nine do not share. They have been too\ntimid.”\nVenli did not miss the Fused using Raboniel’s title. All of them had\nsimilar formal names; the Deepest One using Raboniel’s here—to the\nRhythm of Craving—conveyed respect.\n“The Nine,” Raboniel said, “are taking care to not lose our footing in this\nworld. We have waited thousands of years for this chance; they do not wish\nto trip by running too fast.”\nShe said it, however, to Satisfaction. Her words were respectful, but the\ntone of the rhythm was clear. She appreciated the compliment, and she\nagreed.\nThe other Fused with them hummed to Subservience, something Venli\nalmost never heard from their kind.\n“The Sibling sleeps,” the scout said. “Just as the Midnight Mother felt.\nPerhaps the Sibling has truly died. Permanently made into an unthinking\ncreature.”\n“No,” said another. “The Sibling lives.”\nVenli started. The one she’d mistaken for a soldier earlier, in the dark,\nwas something more. A Fused malen with rippling patterns that shifted and\nchanged on his skin. That was the mark of the mavset-im, Those Ones of\nMasks. The Masked Ones, illusionists, had the power to change how they\nappeared.\n“My form is disrupted,” the Masked One said. “The ralkalest might have\nfallen from the wall, but that is a mere physical barrier. The tower’s\nspiritual protections are at least partially in effect—and as we determined\nmonths ago, the mavset-im cannot bear our many images while near\nUrithiru.”\n“This is as we anticipated,” Raboniel said. “And we do not need your\nmask to proceed. As long as the Deepest Ones can move through the\ntunnels, our mission is viable. Go. We will meet you at the southwest\nopening.”\nThe Deepest Ones dropped their robes, exposing naked skin and\ncarapace-covered privates. Then they slid into the rock, sinking as if into a\ndark ocean up to their necks. Then, eyes closed, they vanished beneath the\nstone.\n* * *\n“I feel blind,” Lirin explained as Kaladin sat with him. Today Hesina was\ntaking Kaladin’s patients—the ones with battle shock—to see the tower\nstables. She insisted that taking care of animals would help, though Kaladin\ncouldn’t fathom how being around those beasts could help anyone’s mood.\nStill, several of the patients had expressed eagerness at the idea of going\nriding.\n“Blind?” Kaladin asked.\n“I’ve had seven textbooks on sanity read to me over the last week,” Lirin\nsaid. “I hadn’t realized how little most of them would say.

Mostly the same\nfew quotes repeated over and over, traced to fewer sources. I can’t believe\nthat we have spent so long knowing so little, documenting nothing!”\n“It’s not so odd,” Kaladin said, building a tower of blocks for his little\nbrother to knock down. “Surgeons are looked at with suspicion even in\nsome of the larger cities. Half the population thinks mental illness is caused\nby staying out in storms, or by taunting deathspren, or some nonsense.”\nLirin rested a hand on the charts on his lap. Oroden laughed, walking\namong the blocks and kicking them.\n“I spent my entire life trying to help,” Lirin said softly. “And I thought\nthat the best way to help lunatics was to send them to the ardents. Storms, I\ndid it a few times. Lakin’s son, remember? I assumed they’d be\nspecialists.…”\n“Nobody knows anything,” Kaladin said. “Because they don’t want to\nknow. People like me scare them.”\n“Don’t include yourself in that group, son,” Lirin said, adjusting his\nspectacles as he held up a medical chart written in glyphs. His father read\nglyphs far better than Kaladin had ever known. Lirin used them like a\nstormwarden.\n“Why shouldn’t I?” Kaladin asked, stacking blocks again.\n“You’re not…” Lirin lowered the chart.\n“Insane?” Kaladin asked. “That’s the problem, isn’t it? We don’t see\nthem as our brothers, sisters, children. They make us feel helpless. We are\nafraid because we can’t bind a broken mind the way we do a broken finger.”\n“So we pretend we’ve done the best we can by sending them away,”\nLirin said. “Or we tell ourselves they’re not really hurt. Since we can’t see\ntheir wounds. You’re right, son. Thank you for challenging me.” He picked\nup another of his pages of notes, scribbled on in glyphs. Pictures, not letters,\nso it wasn’t actual writing.\nStorms. This was wrong. Doctors couldn’t read about diagnoses on their\nown. Ardents were forced to take in patient after patient just so everyone\nelse could breathe a little easier. Many people believed that seeing a\nsurgeon was unnatural—that if the Almighty wanted them to heal, he’d see\nit done. The Edgedancers, ironically, were reinforcing that opinion.\n“We need a medical revolution,” Kaladin said, starting another tower.\nOroden stood hopping up and down, barely able to contain himself as it was\nbuilt. “We need to change everything.”\n“Change is hard, son,” Lirin said. “And little men like us don’t often get\nheard.…” He trailed off, perhaps realizing that excuse didn’t work any\nlonger. Not when his son was one of the most powerful men alive—despite\nhis retirement.\nKaladin could change things. He could get doctors some kind of\nreligious appointment, so they could learn to read without feeling like they\nwere breaking social mores. Everyone was saying it was okay for Dalinar\nbecause he was a Bondsmith, after all."

Everyone was saying it was okay for Dalinar\nbecause he was a Bondsmith, after all.\nKaladin could change the way people thought about those afflicted by\nbattle shock or melancholia. Lirin’s textbooks listed no recommended\nmedication other than sedatives. But no proper tests or research had been\ndone to determine other options. There was so much here. So much to do.\nAnd as Kaladin thought about it, stacking block after block, it occurred to\nhim that he was starting to see his oaths in a new way. He thought about\nthat monastery with the sanitarium, and realized something chilling.\nI could have ended up in there, Kaladin thought. The patients\nsurrendered to the ardents, those were the ones who came from homes and\ncities where people cared enough to try something, even if it was the wrong\nthing. There was a chance that if he hadn’t gone to war, he’d have found his\nway to one of those dark, terrible rooms.\nA low rumble shook him out of his reverie. Was that thunder outside? He\nstood up and glanced out the window. Dark clouds blanketed the horizon.\nThe Everstorm. Right, he’d heard there would be one today. Up here it was\neasy to lose track.\nOroden dashed forward, smashing through the blocks. Kaladin smiled,\nthen heard the outer door of the clinic open and shut. Teft marched into the\nroom a moment later. “Kal, he ain’t at his quarters, and they say he ain’t\ncome in for days.”\n“What?” Kaladin asked. “When was the last time anyone saw him?”\n“Three days ago.”\nThree days?\n“Who is this?” Lirin asked.\n“Friend of ours,” Teft said. “Named Dabbid.”\n“The nonverbal?” Lirin asked. “Badly battle shocked?”\n“I thought maybe he’d do well meeting with the men I’m treating,”\nKaladin said.\n“Maybe,” Lirin said, “you shouldn’t have left someone that troubled\nwithout supervision.”\n“He does fine on his own,” Kaladin said. “He’s not an invalid. He just\ndoesn’t talk.” Or … well, that might be understating it.\n“Let’s check with Rlain,” Teft said. “Dabbid goes to help in the fields\nsometimes.”\nKaladin had been delighted to find that Rlain had chosen to remain at the\ntower instead of going with the army. He thought his work in the fields was\nmore useful than running water and things for the Windrunners, and\nKaladin honestly couldn’t blame him. Being with your friends, watching\nthem fly, but not being able to do so yourself … that had to be even worse\nthan what Kaladin had been experiencing lately.\nI should have gone to him more, Kaladin thought. Been a better friend.\nHe thought he finally understood what Rlain must be feeling.\nHe stood up and nodded to Teft, who was again rubbing his forehead.\n“You all right?” Kaladin asked.\n“Fine,” Teft said.\n“Cravings?” Kaladin guessed.\nTeft shrugged. “Thought I’d gotten past the headaches a few months ago.\nGuess they’re back.”\n* * *\nVenli smashed the human soldier’s skull against the stone wall, and the"

In a\nflash of red lightning from one of the stormforms, she saw the soldier’s eyes\ncross, dilating. But he clung to her, his knife scraping her carapace, so—\ndriven by the Rhythm of Panic—she slammed his head against the ground.\nThis time he fell still. She crouched above him, breathing heavily, then\nsuddenly felt as if she couldn’t breathe. She gasped, hoarse, and pulled her\nhands away. For a moment, the only sound she could hear was her rhythm.\nThe dying man twitched on the ground. She barely felt where he’d cut\nher along the side of her head. Within her, Timbre thrummed the Rhythm of\nthe Lost.\nI didn’t mean to … Venli thought. I …\nSound suddenly returned to Venli. She started, looking around. In the\nheat of the moment, her own struggle had consumed all of her attention.\nNow, the intense fighting at the mouth of the cavern overwhelmed her. She\ncringed, trying to make sense of it all.\n“The spanreed!” someone shouted to the Rhythm of Command. “Don’t\nlet them—”\nRaboniel suddenly dashed through the center of the frenetic scramble.\nThe others were all limbs and shadows, but she was somehow haloed by the\ncrimson light of the Everstorm behind. Raboniel stepped directly into a\nspear strike—though when the weapon rammed into her, it immediately\ntransformed to dust.\nShe sidestepped the soldier and approached a human woman at the side\nof the cavern. The woman was fumbling with a glowing ruby. Raboniel’s\nthin blade—shorter than a sword, but narrow and pointed like a spike—\nrammed up through the human woman’s chin. Raboniel yanked her blade\nfree, then turned back toward the soldier, who had pulled out his side knife.\nShe breathed out toward him, and something black left her lips—something\nthat sent the man stumbling away, clawing at his face.\nRaboniel plucked the spanreed from the dead woman’s hands, then\ncasually wiped her blade on a handkerchief. She saw Venli kneeling nearby.\n“Your first kill, child?” the Fused asked to Ridicule.\n“Y … yes, Ancient One.”\n“I thought your kind fought the humans for years on the Shattered\nPlains.”\n“I was a scholar, Ancient One. I did not go into battle.”\n“Do not let them bring you to the ground,” Raboniel said. “As a Regal—\neven in envoyform—you are stronger than most humans; use that. And\ncarry a knife, for Ado’s sake.”\n“I … Yes, Ancient One. I didn’t see him coming at me, I mean … I\nthought…”\nThat she could remain aloof, as she’d always done with the listeners.\nEven during the battle at Narak, where they’d lost so many, she hadn’t been\ndirectly involved in the fighting.

She hadn’t lost her mind to the spren that\ninhabited her; she’d told herself it was because she was so strong. In truth,\nshe had already been selfish and ambitious.\nTimbre pulsed comfortingly, but Venli couldn’t accept the sentiment. She\nbore the humans no love—they had murdered thousands of her people. But\nVenli herself had doomed many listeners.\nShe didn’t want to kill anyone. Not anymore. She climbed to her feet,\nshaken. Nearby, the last few human soldiers were subdued and killed as the\nEverstorm crashed outside, pouring red light in through the mouth of the\ncavern. Venli turned away from the deaths, then felt embarrassed. What had\nshe expected, in coming on this mission? What did she hope to accomplish\nhere? Make contact with the Radiants while actively invading their base?\nLook for allies as a massacre occurred?\nNo. Neither. She was just trying to stay dry during the storm. Raboniel\ngot out a Stormlight sphere as a group of their Deepest One scouts finally\nemerged from the rock, sliding up out of the floor like spirits.\n“How?” Raboniel asked. “You said you’d cleared the guards at this\nentrance.”\n“We did,” a scout said to Agony. “This was a patrol that came to check\non them, it seems. We did not hear them on the stones until it was too late.”\n“We assumed they were all up higher,” another said. “We are sorry.”\n“Sorrow is meaningless,” Raboniel said. “And bad assumptions are the\nlast failing of many dead. We will not have another chance at this. Ever.\nMake certain the rest of the way is clear.”\nThey hummed again to Agony, then melted into the rock floor of the\ncavern. The soldiers formed up, and Raboniel strode inward, not waiting to\nsee if anyone followed.\nThe group left the rumbling sound of the storm behind and started\nupward. Though they’d begun midway up through the caverns at an\nentrance in a highland valley, it would take hours to reach the tower itself.\nTense hours, hoping that there wouldn’t be any more mistakes or missed\nhuman patrols. Hoping that silence from the dead wouldn’t be noticed.\nVenli walked, disquieted, uncertain which was worse: the feeling of\nprimal terror that had stabbed her when she’d heard the human behind her,\nor the haunting feeling of watching the light fade from his eyes.\nYou have not felt what I have. You have not known what I have. You\nrejected that chance—and wisely, I think.\nAccompanied by several of her scholars and an entire host of soldiers,\nNavani arrived at the scene of the explosion. It was less damaging than\nshe’d feared when reading that initial spanreed report: only two dead, and\nthe explosion had destroyed the contents of only a single room in the tower.\nIt was still deeply troubling. The two dead were Nem and Talnah, the\nlensmakers, astronomers, and gemstone experts. The destroyed room was\ntheir shared laboratory.

The Voidlight one that Gavilar had considered most\nimportant out of all his strange spheres. As Navani stood in the hallway\noutside the destroyed room—smelling smoke, hearing the weeping of the\ncleaning woman who had first rushed to help at the sound of the detonation\n—she had a sinking feeling.\nShe had caused this somehow by asking those two women to study the\nsphere. Now she’d likely lost it and the lives of two expert scholars.\nStorms. What had happened?\nThe guards wanted a scholar to inspect the room for other possible\ndangers before letting Navani enter. She probably could have ordered them\naside, but they were just doing their best to keep her safe. So she let Rushu\ngo in first. Navani doubted that anything dangerous could have survived\nwhat seemed to be complete destruction—but then again, she’d never\nknown a fabrial or sphere to explode.\nRushu slipped out a short time later and nodded for her to enter. Navani\nstepped in, her shoes grinding against broken glass as she surveyed the\nwreckage. Smoldering wood marked the remnants of tables. The bodies\nwere under several bloody sheets. Not two sheets: five. For two corpses.\nStorms.\nNavani picked through carefully, avoiding larger bits of broken glass.\nThe smoke was nearly overpowering. Civilized people used spheres for\nlight, and she rarely kept a hearth burning these days. Smoke was a\ndangerous scent.\nIf anything was salvageable in the mess, Navani didn’t spot it. And of\ncourse there was no sign of the strange sphere.\nRushu stepped up beside Navani. “I … had dinner scheduled with Talnah\nlater this week…” she whispered. “We were … were going to talk about\nweather readings.…”\nNavani steeled herself. “I need you to do something for me, Rushu,” she\nsaid. “Catalogue everything in this room. Don’t let the soldiers move a\nsingle bit of glass. Remove the bodies, see them properly cared for, but\notherwise leave this room pristine. Then go through every inch of it. Save\nevery scrap of paper. Every broken lens or cracked beaker.”\n“If you wish, Brightness,” Rushu said. “But … if I might ask … why?\nWhat do you hope to find?”\n“Have you ever known a fabrial accident to cause an explosion like\nthis?” Navani asked.\nRushu pursed her lips and thought for a moment. “No.”\n“I have some details on what they might have been working on. I’ll\nexplain them to you later. For now, secure this area. And Rushu, please\ndon’t get distracted.”\nThe ardent glanced again toward the shrouded corpses. “I doubt that will\nbe a problem this time, Brightness.”\nNavani nodded and moved out, walking toward where the prisoner was\nbeing kept—the voiceless man who had delivered the ruby. She also sent\nfor a few Radiants to see if they could identify him for certain. She didn’t\nknow if this explosion was tied to the mysterious communications she’d\nbeen getting—but things had certainly been off about the tower lately.

And\nshe had grown tired of wanting answers.\n* * *\nBy the time the second hour had passed—judged by the Rhythm of Peace—\nVenli’s legs were aching, her breathing ragged from the hike. As a Radiant,\nshe could have used Stormlight to strengthen her. But that would have been\nfar too dangerous.\nShe would have to be satisfied with the strength her Regal form gave her.\nCertainly she was better off than an average singer would have been. The\nrest of the force, however—in stormform—was stronger than she was, and\nRaboniel kept an aggressive pace.\nEach moment became excruciating, and Venli focused only on taking the\nnext step. Yet Raboniel kept pushing. No breaks. No rests. Onward, ever\nupward.\nTimbre thrummed inside her, helping with a comforting rhythm. Venli\nused that to keep herself moving, putting one leaden foot in front of the\nother. After what seemed like an eternity, light shimmered in the tunnel\nahead. She tried to smother the spark of hope that gave her. The last twenty\ntimes, the light had been only a sphere lantern set into an intersection,\nplaced by the humans to help navigate.\nRaboniel called a halt. Venli leaned against the side of the tunnel,\nbreathing deeply but as softly as she could. And the wall … the wall was\nstraighter than the ones below. This was of worked stone. And shadows\nmoved in the light ahead.\nThey were here. Finally. The tunnel had come up beneath the city of\nUrithiru, and would now emerge into the basement chambers. Squinting,\nVenli made out the source of light—a large wooden door up ahead, glowing\nat the edges. And … there were lumps on the ground. Guards who had been\nkilled silently by the Deepest Ones.\nOther than the light around the door, the only illumination came from the\nred-ember eyes of the people around her. The sign that a person’s soul had\nbeen mingled with that of a Voidspren. Her own eyes glowed as well, lying\non her behalf. She had a Voidspren too; Timbre simply held it captive.\nSome of the nearby eyes sank, then vanished as the Deepest Ones slid\ninto the stone. The rest of them waited in agonizing silence. This was the\npoint where their invasion was most likely to be thwarted. Deepest Ones\nworked well as surprise troops, but—from planning meetings she’d\nattended—she knew they didn’t have the skill or strength to challenge\nRadiants in direct battle. So if Radiants could be gathered to defend the\ncrystalline heart of the tower, they could rebuff this attack.\nVenli waited, tense, sweat from the climb dripping down her cheeks and\nfrom her chin.\nThe door ahead rattled. Then opened.\nA Deepest One scout stood beyond. As soon as Raboniel started moving,\nVenli shoved forward, staying at the front of the crowd as they passed into\nthe basement chamber.\nIt was a horrific scene.

A couple were still alive, held to the ground by arms that reached up\nout of the stone. Most of those who were dead had been away from the\nwalls, and it seemed Deepest Ones had dropped from the ceiling to grapple\nthem. It had all been accomplished without a single human crying out.\nVenli shuddered, imagining being pulled to the floor while other arms\nreached up to grab your mouth and neck. The living humans struggled with\nwide eyes. Some of those phantom hands had long knifelike carapace\nfingernails. One at a time, they slit the throats of the captives.\nVenli looked away, sick to her stomach. She had to walk through blood\nto follow Raboniel toward the center of the room—and the monolith of\ncrystal that stood here. The wide pillar was made of a thousand different\ngems. Other than the tunnel they had emerged from, only one exit led from\nthis circular chamber: a larger, well-lit corridor with tile murals on the walls\nand ceiling.\n“I hope your slumber is peaceful, Sibling,” Raboniel said, resting a hand\nupon the imposing pillar. “You shall not awake, at least not as yourself.”\nVoidlight—glowing violet on black—surged along Raboniel’s arm.\nShe’d said she would need time to accomplish her task: corrupting the pillar\nand fully activating the tower’s defenses, but in a way that muted Radiants,\nnot Fused.\nPlease, Venli thought to the Rhythm of the Lost, let it happen without\nmore killing.\n* * *\n“Can’t believe how dead this place is,” Teft said as they passed through the\nwinehouse.\n“I’d guess a lot of the patrons were soldiers,” Kaladin said, gesturing\ntoward Adolin’s corner booth. It felt strange to visit without him and\nShallan. In fact, it felt strange to be going out anywhere without those two.\nKaladin tried to remember the last time he’d gone out for fun without\nAdolin forcing him. Skar’s wedding? Yes, Lyn had made him go right\nbefore their breakup. That had been the last time he’d gone out with Bridge\nFour.\nBlood of my fathers, he thought, sliding into the booth. I really have been\nwithdrawing from them. From everyone. Except Adolin, who wouldn’t\nstand for it. Half the reason Kaladin had begun courting Lyn was due to\nAdolin and Syl conspiring against him. Storming man. Storming spren.\nBless them both. Though the relationship hadn’t worked out, he could now\nsee that they’d both grown because of it.\nTeft went to fetch drinks. Orange for both of them. As Kaladin settled\ninto the seat, he noted some of the scratched-in sketches Shallan had done\nwith a knife on the tabletop. One was a rather unflattering picture of him in\noversized boots.\nWhen Teft returned, Kaladin eagerly took a long drink from his mug.\nTeft just stared at his. “What happens if I get some red?”\n“Tonight? Probably nothing. But you’ll get it next time.”\n“And then I’ll get some violet,” Teft said. “Then something clear."

Teft clicked his against it.\n“To unfairness,” Kaladin said.\n“Storming straight,” Teft said, then downed his entire mug at once in an\nimpressive display.\nSyl darted in a short time later. The place wasn’t busy, but there were\nsome people about. Relaxing into their seats, complaining jovial\ncomplaints, laughing ornery laughs, all of it lubricated by a little alcohol.\nThat stopped when Rlain stepped in behind Syl. Kaladin winced at how\nobvious it was. The people of the tower knew about Rlain—he was nearly\nas famous as Kaladin—but … well, Kaladin heard what they said about\nhim. The “savage” that Dalinar had somehow “tamed.”\nMany treated Rlain like some dark unknown quantity that should be\nlocked away. Others, ostensibly more charitable, spoke of Rlain as some\nnoble warrior, a mystical representative of a lost people. Both groups shared\na similar problem. They saw only their own strange ideal of what he should\nbe. A controversy, a curiosity, or a symbol. Not who he was.\nThough Rlain seemed not to notice the way the winehouse grew quiet,\nKaladin knew that was a front. The listener always noticed. Still, he crossed\nthe room with a ready smile—he often exaggerated his facial expressions\naround humans, to try to put them at ease.\n“Teft,” he said, taking a seat. He looked to Kaladin. “Sir.”\n“Just Kaladin now,” Kaladin replied as Syl flew up to settle onto his\nshoulder.\n“You might not be in command anymore,” Rlain said with a slight\ncadence to his words, “but you’re still the captain of Bridge Four.”\n“What did you think all that time, Rlain?” Teft asked. “Carrying bridges\nagainst your own kind?”\n“Didn’t think a ton at first,” Rlain said, trying to flag down a passing\nserver. She jumped, then quickly moved in the other direction to tug on the\narm of a more experienced server. Rlain sighed, then turned back to Teft. “I\nwas in Damnation, same as the rest of you. I wasn’t thinking about spying; I\nwas thinking about surviving. Or about how to get a message to Eshonai—\nshe was our general.”\nHis demeanor changed, as did his tone, the cadence to his words\nbecoming slower. “The first time I almost died,” he said, “I realized that the\narchers would have no idea—from a distance—who I was. They couldn’t\nsee my pattern. It had been discussed what we’d do if the humans ever\nstarted using parshmen for runs, and we’d decided we had to drop them,\nsame as humans.

Nothing to be\ndone about it. You act like it’s as inevitable as the sun and storms. But it’s\nnot. You don’t have to kill each other.”\nKaladin shared a glance with Teft and Rlain, the latter humming to a\nmournful cadence. She wasn’t wrong. Most everyone would agree.\nUnfortunately, when you got down to the bloody details, it wasn’t so\nsimple.\nIt was the same problem Kaladin had always had with his father. Lirin\nsaid you couldn’t fight without perpetuating the system, eventually causing\nthe common people to suffer more than if you’d refused. Kaladin found\nfault in that reasoning, but hadn’t been able to explain it to Lirin. And so he\ndoubted he could explain it to a piece of divinity—a literal embodiment of\nhope and honor.\nHe could just do his best to change what he could. That started with\nhimself. “Rlain,” Kaladin said. “I don’t think I’ve ever apologized for what\nwe did in desecrating the bodies of the fallen listeners to make armor.”\n“No,” Rlain said. “I don’t think you ever did, sir.”\n“I apologize now. For the pain we caused you. I don’t know if there was\nanything else we could have done, but…”\n“The sentiment means a lot to me, Kal,” Rlain said. “It does.” They sat\nin silence for a short time.\n“So…” Teft eventually said. “Dabbid.”\n“I saw him yesterday,” Rlain said. “He stopped by the fields, but didn’t\ndo much work. Wandered around a bit, helped when I asked him to run an\nerrand. Then he faded away.”\n“And you couldn’t find him today?” Teft asked.\n“No, but the tower is a big place.” Rlain turned around, glancing toward\nsomething Kaladin couldn’t see. “Bad day to get lost though…”\n“What do you mean?” Teft asked, frowning.\n“The Everstorm?” Rlain said. “Right. You can’t hear the rhythms. You\ncan’t feel when it passes.”\nKaladin had forgotten again. Storms, being up here in the tower felt like\nbeing blind. Losing a sense you’d always had—in this case the ability to\nglance at the sky and know if a storm was happening.\nTeft grunted, finally getting one of the servers to come over so he could\norder some red for Rlain.\n“How worried should we be about Dabbid?” Rlain asked.\n“I don’t know,” Kaladin said. “Lopen always looked after him. I want\nDabbid to join the program Teft and I are setting up. To help people like\nhim. Like us.”\n“You think it will get him talking?” Rlain asked.\n“At any rate, I think listening to the others could help him.”"

Had it?\nHad talking to Noril helped?\n“He’s been avoiding joining in,” Teft said.\n“I haven’t,” Kaladin snapped. “I’ve been busy.”\nTeft gave him a flat stare. Storming sergeants. They always heard the\nthings you weren’t saying.\n“I need to get the program up and running first,” Kaladin said. “Find all\nthe men who’ve been tucked away in dark rooms, and get them help. Then I\ncan rest.”\n“Pardon, sir,” Rlain said, “but don’t you need it as much as they do?\nMaybe it would be restful to participate.”\nKaladin turned away, and found Syl—on his shoulder—glaring as hard\nas Teft. She’d even given herself a little Bridge Four uniform … and was he\nwrong, or was it more blue than the rest of her body? As their bond\ndeepened and she entered this realm more strongly, the variety, detail, and\nhues of her forms were improving.\nMaybe they were right. Maybe he should take part more in the meetings\nwith the battle-shocked men. He just wasn’t sure he deserved to divert\nresources or time from them. Kaladin still had a family. He had support. He\nwasn’t locked away in darkness. How could he worry about himself when\nothers needed him?\nHis friends weren’t going to relent on this, he could tell. All three of\nthem, bullying him together. “Fine,” Kaladin said. “I’ll join the next\nmeeting. I was thinking about it anyway.”\nThey acted like he was avoiding getting help. But he’d stepped down as\nDalinar demanded. He’d started working as a surgeon. And he had to admit\nit was helping. Being with his family, talking to his parents, knowing he\nwas wanted and needed … that helped more.\nThis project though, finding those who were like him, alleviating their\nsuffering … that would help the most. Strength before weakness. He was\ncoming to understand that part of his first oath. He had discovered weakness\nin himself, but that wasn’t something to be ashamed of. Because of that\nweakness, he could help in ways nobody else could.\nSyl glowed a little brighter on his shoulder as he acknowledged that, and\nhe felt a warmth within. His own darkness hadn’t gone away, of course. He\ncontinued to have nightmares. And the other day when a soldier had handed\nKaladin his spear, it had … Well, it had made him panic. That reaction\nreminded him of how he’d refused to hold a spear when first training Bridge\nFour in the chasms.\nHis illness stretched all the way back to before that time. He’d never\ntreated it—he’d merely kept heaping on the stress, the pain, the problems.\nIf this went well, maybe he wouldn’t ever have to pick up the spear\nagain. And maybe he’d be fine with that. He smiled at Rlain. “It has been\nhelping,” he said. “I think … I think I might be putting myself back"

He smiled at Rlain. “It has been\nhelping,” he said. “I think … I think I might be putting myself back\ntogether, for the first time in my life.”\n* * *\nVenli could see the exact moment when the tower broke. Raboniel stood,\nher hands on the pillar, glowing fiercely with Voidlight. The pillar, in turn,\nbegan glowing with its own light: a vivid white, tinged faintly green-blue.\nThis light that seemed to transcend the type of gemstones in the pillar. The\ntower was resisting.\nAn alarm sounded from the corridor; the invasion had been noticed.\nRaboniel didn’t move, though Venli pulled back against the wall—trying\nnot to step on corpses—as a hundred stormforms pushed out into the\ncorridor.\nShouting humans, clashes of metal, cracks of sound. Any moment now,\nthe Radiants would arrive and shear through the Regals and Deepest Ones\nlike a flash of lightning on a dark night. Still Raboniel worked, calmly\nhumming to a rhythm that Venli did not know.\nThen finally it happened: the Voidlight moved from Raboniel into the\npillar. It infused a small section of the majestic construction, crawling into\nan embedded grouping of garnets.\nRaboniel stumbled away and Venli managed to dash over and catch her,\nkeeping her from tumbling to the ground. Raboniel sagged, her eyes\ndrooping, and Venli held her tight, attuned to the Rhythm of the Terrors.\nCries continued in the hallway outside.\n“Is it done?” Venli asked softly.\nRaboniel nodded, then righted herself and spoke to the rest of the singers\ngathered in the tunnel leading to the caverns. “The tower is not fully\ncorrupted, but I have achieved my initial goal. The tower’s defenses have\nbeen activated and inverted to our favor. The Radiants will be unable to\nfight. Go. Give the signal to the shanay-im. Seize the city.”\nHowever, though you think not as a mortal, you are their kin. The\npower of Odium’s Shard is more dangerous than the mind behind it.\nParticularly since any Investiture seems to gain a will of its own when\nnot controlled.\nTeft dropped limp, as if he’d suddenly lost motor functions, his head\nthumping against the table and his arm flopping to the side, pushing his\nempty mug off it to crash to the floor.\nKaladin felt a striking moment of disorientation. A feeling of oppression\non his mind, like a dark force trying to smother him. He gasped, then gritted\nhis teeth. Not now. He would not let his treasonous mind overwhelm him\nnow! His friend was in trouble.\nKaladin pushed through the melancholy and was on Teft in a second,\nloosening the man’s collar, pressing fingers to his carotid artery. Good\npulse, Kaladin thought. No arrhythmia I can sense, and no obvious signs of\nabrasion on the body. He pulled back an eyelid with his thumb. Dilated\neyes. Trembling, shaking, sightless.\n“Storms!” Rlain said, scrambling out of the booth and standing up.\nPeople from nearby tables leaped up in shock, then began crowding to see"

It felt\nmore external than normal, but he’d learned—these last few months—that\nhis battle shock could take many forms. He was getting to where he could\nconfront it. But later. Not now.\n“Have the people stand back,” Kaladin said to Rlain, his voice calm. Not\nbecause he felt calm, but because of his father’s training. A calm surgeon\ninspired trust. “Give us some air. He’s breathing and his pulse is good.”\n“Is he going to be all right?” Rlain held out his hands to get the people to\nback away. His voice had fallen into a thick Parshendi accent—which in\nthis case meant a heavy rhythm as if he were singing.\nKaladin held Teft’s hand, watching for signs of epileptic motion. “I think\nit might be a seizure,” Kaladin said, feeling inside Teft’s mouth. “Some\nfiremoss addicts have them during withdrawal.”\n“He hasn’t touched the stuff in months.”\nSo he says, Kaladin thought. Teft had lied before. He had tells, though,\nand he usually came clean to Kaladin. He’s not clamping his jaw. No danger\nto his tongue. Still best to keep him facing sideways, in case of vomit. And\nhe was trembling, the muscles of his arms spasming faintly.\n“Might be a kind of aftereffect,” Kaladin said. “Some addicts feel them\nfor years.” Not seizures though. “If it’s not that, then…”\n“What?” Rlain asked as the winehouse owner pushed through the crowd\nto see what was happening.\n“Stroke,” Kaladin said, making the decision. He got underneath Teft and\nrolled his limp form up onto his shoulders, then stood with a grunt. “There\nisn’t much I can do here, but we have some anticoagulants at the clinic. If it\nis a stroke, those sometimes help.”\nRlain moved to take one of Teft’s arms. “The Edgedancers maybe? They\nhave that clinic in the market nearby.”\nKaladin felt stupid. Of course. That was a far better option. He nodded.\n“I’ll help you carry,” Rlain said.\n“I can Lash him,” Kaladin said, reaching for Stormlight. The Light oddly\nresisted for a moment, then streamed into him from the spheres in his\npocket. He came alive with power. It churned in his veins, urging him to use\nit. To act. To run.\n“I’ll make a hole,” Rlain said. He shoved his way through the crowd,\nopening up a path for Kaladin.\nKaladin commanded the Light into Teft, to Lash him upward in order to\nmake him lighter.\nAnd it didn’t work.\n* * *\n“Yes, I recognize him,” Red said.\nNavani nodded in thanks, encouraging the tall Lightweaver to continue.\nHe wore darkeyed worker’s clothing—brown trousers, a buttoned shirt with"

Thaylen sailor\nfashion had been making its mark on Urithiru.\nShe was holding her interrogation on the fifth floor, not far from where\nthe laboratory had been destroyed. She’d ordered the prisoner placed in an\nadjoining small room, accompanied by several guards.\nRed had been the first to respond among the Radiants she’d sent for. “His\nname’s Dabbid,” Red explained, peeking into the room with the prisoner.\n“Doesn’t talk. I don’t think he’s right in the head. Well, pardon, most\nWindrunners ain’t right in the head. They act like some kind of cult to\nStormblessed, Brightness, pardon that, but they do that. This one’s extra\nodd though. I think he was one of the old ones, from Bridge Four. Gaz\ncould tell you. He’s got a history with them.”\n“Do you see a spren?” Navani asked.\nRed’s eyes unfocused, and he seemed to be staring into the distance. He\nhad light violet eyes now, though he’d been a darkeyes before joining the\nLightweavers. Like others of his order, he could peer into Shadesmar.\n“Don’t think so,” he said.\n“That’s not a terribly encouraging answer, Radiant.”\n“This tower makes things hard,” he said. “In Shadesmar, this place\nglows like Nomon’s own backside. That interferes. But I’m pretty sure I’d\nbe able to see an honorspren. Same for one of the other Radiant spren.”\nShe peeked into the interrogation room. This Windrunner—or whatever\nhe was—sat at a small table, legs in chains, watched over by two of\nNavani’s soldiers. When he glanced at Navani, he had that same wild cast\nas before. His hands were free, so he raised them toward her. One of the\nsoldiers reached to stop him, but wasn’t fast enough to prevent the captive\nfrom tapping his wrists together.\nThe Windrunner salute. He made the gesture again and again as the\nsoldiers tried to settle him.\n“Leave him alone,” Navani said, stepping into the room.\nThe soldiers backed off, and the young man continued tapping his wrists\ntogether, frantic. Then he pointed at the wall. What? Was he actually mute?\nHe pointed more fervently. Navani turned. No, he wasn’t pointing at the\nwall, but at the sphere in the lantern hanging there, lighting the room. Next,\nhe made a writing motion, frantic.\nI think he wants me to contact the spren, she thought.\nHe’d been delivering a new ruby when they’d caught him. Navani fished\nit out of her glove, and the prisoner grew more animated, pointing at it.\n“Kalami?” Navani said into the other room.\nThe scribe poked her head in, and Navani handed her the ruby. The\nwoman took it and retreated to set up the spanreed equipment.\n“Red says you don’t speak,” Navani said to the man.\nHe looked down. Then he shook his head."

It’s a spren that has been talking to you, is that right?”\nThe man hung his head farther. Then he nodded.\n“You realize it could be one of the Unmade,” Navani said. “A Voidspren.\nThe enemy.”\nThe man looked up sharply. Then he shook his head.\n“Brightness!” Kalami shouted from the other room. “Brightness, you\nneed to see this!”\nFrowning, Navani strode into the larger chamber outside the\ninterrogation room where Kalami—along with several of her wards—had\nset up the spanreed. It was scribbling on its own as Navani glanced at the\ntext.\nFool human. We are under attack. The enemy is already inside the tower.\nQuickly!

He’d\nstarted to take a step, fully anticipating Teft’s limp body would grow lighter.\nWhen it didn’t, he was thrown off balance.\nHe tried again, focusing. Again nothing.\nStorms, Kaladin thought. Something was deeply wrong with him. The\nlast time something like this had happened, he’d been dangerously close to\nviolating his oaths and killing Syl.\n“Syl?” he asked, scanning the room. She’d been flying around over near\nthe bar, hadn’t she? “Syl!”\nNo response.\n“Phendorana?” Kaladin asked, naming Teft’s honorspren. “This would\nbe a great time to show yourself to me!”\nNothing. The winehouse had grown quiet, many of them staring at\nKaladin as he steamed with Stormlight.\n“Kal?” Rlain called from the doorway.\nKaladin shifted Teft on his shoulders, then strode after Rlain. Stormlight\ndidn’t seem to give one much additional raw strength, but it did steady the\nlimbs, repairing the muscles if they began to tear beneath strain. So he\ncould bear Teft at a brisk jog, even without Lashing him. He gripped the\nbody in a secure medic’s carry—a skill he’d learned on the battlefield.\n“Something’s wrong,” Kaladin said to Rlain as they reached the door.\n“More than whatever happened to Teft.”\n“I know,” Rlain said. “I didn’t notice it at first, but the rhythms are going\ncrazy. I can faintly hear new ones in the distance. I don’t much like them.\nThey sound like the rhythms I hear during an Everstorm.”\n“Is that one still blowing outside?”\n“It just ended,” Rlain said."

Unfortunately, a number of people had crowded\nhere, and that slowed Kaladin and Rlain’s progress.\nThey eventually shoved through to the front, calls of “Brightlord\nStormblessed” making people turn around. At the center of the mess\nthough, they found something horrifying: two Edgedancers lying on the\nground. An ordinary non-Radiant nurse was yelling at people to give them\nspace.\nKaladin left Teft with Rlain and scrambled over to kneel before one of\nthe unconscious Radiants, a vaguely familiar Edgedancer woman, short,\nwith dyed hair. “What happened?” he asked the nurse, who seemed to\nrecognize Kaladin immediately.\n“They both suddenly dropped, Brightlord! I’m afraid Lorain hit her\nhead; there’s bleeding. I evacuated the clinic immediately, in case the\nunconsciousness was caused by leaking dazewater.”\n“Quick thinking,” Kaladin said. The Edgedancers seemed more deeply\nunconscious than Teft. No quivering eyes. No muscle spasms.\n“Have you ever seen anything like it?” the nurse asked.\n“Something similar just happened to my friend. Another Radiant.”\n“Not you though?”\nI always live, Kaladin thought, a bitter thought echoing from long ago.\nSo I can keep suffering.\nHe pushed that aside. “The best thing I can think of to do is go to my\nfather. He’s the most experienced surgeon I know. Treat these for shock and\nbandage that head wound. I’ll send you word if I discover anything.”\nThe nurse nodded and Kaladin left her, helping Rlain lift Teft as they\npushed through the crowd.\n“Why don’t you Lash him again?” Rlain said.\n“I can’t. My Lashings don’t seem to work.”\n“What, just on Teft?” Rlain asked. “Or at all?”\nStorms, that was a stupid thing to have not checked. Kaladin set down\nTeft’s legs and took his sphere pouch from his pocket, kneeling as he tried\nto infuse the ground.\nIt didn’t work. He frowned, then tried a different Lashing—the type that\nmade things stick to other objects. Not a gravitational Lashing, but a Full\nLashing. The one Lopen loved to use to stick people to walls.\nThat Full Lashing worked. When he touched his boot to that patch of\nstone, it stuck in place. He reclaimed the Light without any problems. So …\nAdhesion worked but Gravitation didn’t?\n“I have no idea what is going on,” Kaladin said to Rlain.\n“This can’t be a coincidence,” Rlain said. “You losing some of your\npowers? Three Radiants all fainting? People don’t have strokes in groups,\ndo they?”\n“No,” Kaladin said as the two of them began jogging, carrying Teft\nbetween them. “There’s more, Rlain. I feel something pressing against my\nmind. I thought it was my illness. But if you say you can hear something\nodd…”\nWhat did it mean? Was this … this like the fabrial the Fused had used on\nhim in Hearthstone? It felt eerily similar in many ways."

It was wide and tall, and led up\nthe first ten floors. It would be a faster climb than using the lifts. However,\nas they neared the steps, a scream echoed from one of the nearby tunnels.\nKaladin and Rlain froze at the intersection. Sphere lanterns lined the\ntunnels here, and the strata spiraled, making it seem as if—in looking down\na tunnel—you were looking at the inside of a nut threaded for a screw. An\nagitated group was forming at the other side.\n“I’ll check,” Rlain said. “You keep going with Teft?”\nKaladin nodded, not wanting to speak and waste Stormlight. He took\nTeft toward the steps as Rlain jogged off. The people Kaladin passed didn’t\nseem to sense anything wrong; they only looked curiously at Kaladin and\nhis burden. Some saluted, others bowed, but Radiants were common\nenough in these halls that most simply stepped aside.\nHe was halfway up the first flight of the grand staircase when Rlain came\nrunning up at a sprint. People gave way for him, even made superstitious\ngestures when they saw him.\n“Thank the storms I can wear warform around you people now,” he said,\nreaching Kaladin. He was puffing from the run, but didn’t seem exhausted.\n“I’d hate to try to make that run in dullform. Someone found a Stoneward\nunconscious in the hallway. Something is striking at the Radiants\nspecifically. One of the Unmade?”\n“It feels like that fabrial I found in Hearthstone,” Kaladin said. “But it’s\nobviously on a much grander scale, and more powerful, if it’s knocking out\nRadiants. The one I faced must have been some kind of prototype.”\n“What do we do?”\n“My mother has my spanreed to Dalinar’s scribes, so the clinic is\nprobably still our best course for now.”\nThe other flights passed in a flash, though Rlain had drawn three\ndifferent exhaustionspren—like jets of dust—by the time they reached the\nsixth floor. He waved Kaladin ahead. They’d meet up at the clinic.\nKaladin sucked in another breath of Stormlight and redoubled his efforts,\ndashing through the hallway, Teft across his shoulders. He shoved past the\npeople waiting outside the clinic—that was another oddity, since it was\nafter hours—and pushed through the door.\nThe waiting room was lit with spheres and crowded with worried people.\nWhen Kaladin’s mother saw him, she immediately began clearing room for\nhim to pass.\n“Lirin!” she shouted. “Another one!”\nKaladin jogged down the hall to the first exam room, where a Radiant—\nin an Aladar uniform—lay on the exam table. He recognized her. Another\nStoneward.\nLirin looked up from examining her pupils. “Sudden unconsciousness?”\nhe asked.\n“I thought it might be a stroke at first,” Kaladin said, carefully unslinging\nTeft and settling him on the floor.

New, but\nfamiliar at the same time.\nSyl? he thought, throwing himself to his feet, sweat spraying from his\nskin. “Syl!” he shouted.\n“Son, a surgeon must be calm during—”\n“Storm off with the lectures for once, Father!” Kaladin shouted. “Syl!”\n… here … He felt her voice.

Indeed, the two she pulled out gave no\nresponse when she twisted the rubies. They were as dead as the one on the\ntable. She glanced at Red lying on the floor. Kalami was checking his eyes;\nshe was an officer’s daughter, and had been taught field medicine. She’d\nalready sent one of the girls to run for an Edgedancer.\nAn attack. With no spanreeds to communicate? Storms, it would be\nchaos.\nNavani stood up. If it was going to be chaos, then someone had to fight\nit. “Soldiers, I need you in here! Spanreeds aren’t working. Who is the\nfastest runner among you?”\nThe scribes gaped at her, and all three of her soldiers—the ones who had\nbeen watching the captive in the other chamber—stepped in. The men\nlooked at one another, then one of the soldiers raised his hand. “I’m\nprobably fastest, Brightness.”\n“All right,” Navani said, dashing to the table and pulling out a sheet of\npaper. “I need you to run to the first floor—use the stairs, not the lifts—and\nget to the scouting office near the second sector. You know it, the place\nwhere we’re organizing the mapping of the Plains? Good. Have them\nmobilize every runner they have.\n“They are to send someone to each of the tower’s seven garrisons with a\ncopy of this message. Every remaining runner, and all the scribes in the\noffice, are to meet me on the second floor at the maps room. It’s the largest\nsecure place I can think of right now.”\n“Um, yes, Brightness.”\n“Warn them to move quickly!” Navani said. “I have reason to believe\nthat a dangerous attack is coming.” She scribbled some instructions on the\npaper—commanding the seven garrisons to deploy according to one of the\npredefined plans, then adding her current authentication phrase. She ripped\noff the paper and thrust it at the soldier, who took off at a dash.\nThen she wrote it again and sent it with her second-fastest man—telling\nhim to use a different route. Once he was off, she sent the last soldier to the\nWindrunners. There should be about twenty of them—four full knights and\ntheir squires—remaining in the tower.\n“But Brightness,” the guard said, taking the note she handed him, “you’ll\nbe unguarded.”\n“I’ll manage,” she said. “Go!”"

Finally he dashed away.\nStorms, she thought, looking at the fallen Red. What if they can do to\nother Radiants what they did to Red? How did they pick him out? She got a\nsick feeling in her stomach, a premonition. What if whatever had happened\nto him hadn’t been targeted, but was instead a side effect of whatever was\nhappening to the spanreeds?\n“Gather our things,” she said to the scribes. “We’re moving to the map\nroom.”\n“Red—” Kalami began.\n“We have to leave him. Leave a note saying where we went.”\nShe stepped into the smaller room. The prisoner, Dabbid, had pulled off\nhis chair, and was now huddled on the floor. The manacles on his legs\nclanked as he shifted.\n“The spren of the tower spoke to you,” Navani said to him. “It had you\nplace the spanreed gem for me. How did you know what to do?”\nThe man only looked at the floor.\n“Listen to me,” Navani said—keeping her distance just in case, but also\ntrying to make her voice sound calm, reassuring. “I’m not angry at you; I\nunderstand why you did what you did, but something terrible is happening,\nand spanreeds aren’t working. I need to know how to contact the spren.”\nThe man stared at her, wide eyed. Storms, she wasn’t sure he was\ncapable of understanding. Something was clearly wrong with him.\nThe man moved, the chains clanking, and Navani jumped despite\nherself. He didn’t move toward her though. He shifted and stood, then\nreached out to touch the wall. He rested his hand against the stone there,\nwhich was marked by strata lines. And … and a vein of crystal?\nNavani moved closer. Yes, running through the strata was a fine garnet\nvein. She’d noted similar veins; in some rooms they were nearly invisible,\nperfectly mimicking the waving strata. In others they stood out starkly,\nstraight and bold, running from floor to ceiling.\n“The spren of the tower,” Navani said. “She talked to you through these\nveins of garnet?”\nThe captive nodded.\n“Thank you,” Navani said.\nHe tapped his wrists together. Bridge Four.\nNavani tossed him the key to his manacles. “We’re going to the map\nroom on the second floor. We must move quickly. Join us, if you wish.”\nShe hurried back to the others. There was a vein of garnet in the map\nroom. She’d see what she could do with it once she arrived.\n* * *\nKaladin stared at his surgery knives.\nSyl couldn’t form a Shardblade.

The scalpel of a surgeon was a very\ndifferent thing from a soldier’s knife. A surgeon’s knife could be a subtle\nthing, meant to cause as little harm as possible. A delicate contradiction.\nLike Kaladin himself.\nHe reached out to touch one of them, and his hand didn’t shake as he’d\nfeared it would. The knife—glowing in the spherelight as if it were aflame\n—was cold to his touch. A part of him had expected it to be angry, but this\ntool didn’t care how he used it. It had been designed to heal, but could kill\nas efficiently. Like Kaladin himself.\nOutside the surgery room, people screamed amid writhing fearspren. The\nFused were landing on the balconies of this level, and the cries of the\nterrified echoed through the halls of Urithiru. Kaladin had sent Rlain to hide\nin the living quarters of the clinic—he didn’t know how the Fused would\nreact to finding a listener here, wearing an Alethi uniform.\nKaladin delayed. He should go hide too. Wait it out. That was what his\nfather wanted.\nInstead, Kaladin’s fingers wrapped around the knife, and he turned\ntoward the screams. He was needed. Life before death. This was what he\ndid.\nYet as he walked toward the door, he found himself laden by a terrible\nweight. His feet were as if in chains, and his clothing could have been made\nof lead. He reached the doorway, and found himself panting in a cold sweat.\nIt had been going so well.\nHe felt so tired all of a sudden. Why couldn’t he just rest for a little\nwhile?\nNo. He had to march out there and fight. He was Kaladin Stormblessed.\nThey were depending on him. They needed him. He’d had a short leave.\nBut now … now he needed to …\nWhat if one of them dies because they were expecting your help, but\nyou’ve frozen up again. What if they died like Tien? What if he froze like\nwhen Elhokar died? What if …\nWhat if …\n“Kaladin?”\nSyl’s voice shook him awake. He found himself sitting beside the\nsurgery room doorway, his back up against the wall, clutching the knife in\nfront of him and trembling.\n“Kaladin?” Syl asked again. She stepped forward on the floor. “I went to\nwarn Queen Navani, as you asked. But I couldn’t get too far away from\nyou, for some reason. I found some messengers though, and they said that\nthey had orders from the queen—so she seems to know about the invasion\nalready.”\nHe nodded.\n“Kaladin, they’re everywhere,” Syl said. “The messenger said a big force\ncame up from the caverns and took the heart pillar room. The enemy has the\nOathgates running. They’re bringing in troops, and … Kaladin, what’s\nwrong with you?”\n“Cold sweats,” he muttered. “Emotional detachment. Insensibility,\naccompanied by hyper-recall of traumatic moments.” Someone shouted out\non the balcony and he jumped, brandishing the knife. “Severe anxiety…”"

Insensibility,\naccompanied by hyper-recall of traumatic moments.” Someone shouted out\non the balcony and he jumped, brandishing the knife. “Severe anxiety…”\nFootsteps in the hallway made Kaladin grip the knife harder in a sweaty\nhand. No Fused appeared, however. It was just his father carrying a\nbloodred sphere for light. He halted upon seeing Kaladin, then moved with\nexaggerated calmness, smiling in a friendly way. Storms. If his father put on\nthat face, things really were bad.\n“Put down the knife, son,” Lirin said softly. “It’s all right. You aren’t\nneeded.”\n“I’m well, Father,” Kaladin said. “I just … wasn’t quite ready to take up\nthe fight so soon. That’s it.”\n“Put down the knife and we’ll plan.”\n“I need to resist.”\n“Resist what?” Lirin said. “Together Laral, your mother, and I got our\npeople into their rooms. The invading parshmen aren’t here to kill; nobody\nwas hurt except for that fool Jam, who found a spear somehow.”\n“Has the queen surrendered?” Kaladin asked.\nLirin didn’t reply, though his eyes were still on the knife.\n“No,” Syl said. “At least, she was sending out orders. But Kaladin …\nthey can’t fight for long. There are Fused among the enemy, and Regals,\nand … and almost every Shardbearer is out in the field. Every Surgebinder\nin the tower has been knocked unconscious.”\nKaladin took his father by the arm. “There’s one left,” he said, then\nhauled himself to his feet.\n“Kal!” Lirin said, anger peeking through his calm surgeon’s mask.\n“Don’t be a fool. There’s no point in playing the hero.”\n“I’m not playing anything,” Kaladin said. “This is who I am.”\n“So you’ll go fight, like this?” Lirin demanded. “Overwhelmed by\ndiaphoresis and hand tremors, barely able to stay on your feet!”\nKaladin gritted his teeth and started along the hall toward the front door\nof the clinic. Syl landed on his shoulder, but didn’t insist he stop.\n“You said that Jam had a spear,” Kaladin said. “Do you know what\nhappened to it?”\n“Storms, son, listen to me,” Lirin said, grabbing him from behind.\n“There is no battle for you here! The tower has fallen. You go out there, and\nyou throw away any advantage you had. Storms, you won’t only get\nyourself killed—you’ll get us killed.”\nKaladin stopped in place.\n“That’s right,” his father said. “What do you think they’ll do to the\nfamily of the Radiant who attacked them? You’d probably kill a few before\nyou died. Stormfather knows, you’re good at breaking things. Then they’ll\ncome and string me up. Do you want to see that happen to me? To your\nmother? To your baby brother?”\n“Storm you,” Kaladin whispered. Lirin didn’t care about saving himself;\nhe was not so selfish as that. But he was a surgeon. He knew the vital spots\nin which to stick a knife."

He knew the vital spots\nin which to stick a knife.\nShouts came from deeper within Urithiru—the voices of singers, with\nrhythms. They’d landed Fused here on the sixth floor, but others were\nboiling up from below.\nKelek’s breath … Dalinar had taken the reserves to the battle in Emul.\nThere were seven garrisons left in the tower, but each was severely\nundermanned, populated mostly with those men who were off rotation,\nenjoying leave. Five thousand men, max. Everyone had assumed the large\nnumbers of Radiants would be able to prevent another raid on the tower.…\nKaladin sagged against the wall. “We … we need to find a way to\ncontact Dalinar and Jasnah. The spanreeds aren’t working?”\n“None of them,” Lirin said. “No fabrials at all.”\n“How are they using the Oathgates?” Kaladin asked, settling down on\nthe floor of the hallway.\n“Maybe it’s the Skybreakers,” Syl said. “But … I don’t know, Kaladin.\nSomething is very wrong with our bond. When I flew down just one floor, I\nfound myself growing distant. Forgetful. Normally I can go miles away\nbefore that happens.”\n“We can plan,” Lirin said. “We can think of some way to contact the\nBlackthorn. There are other ways to fight, son.”\n“Perhaps,” Kaladin said. He met his father’s eyes. “But you would say\nanything to keep me from going out there, wouldn’t you?”\nLirin held his eyes and said nothing.\nI’m really not in any shape to go to battle, Kaladin thought. And … and\nif they have the Oathgates …\nLirin calmly took the knife from Kaladin’s hands. He let it go. His father\nhelped him to his feet and led him to the back rooms, where a village girl\nwas with Oroden, keeping him quiet with toys. Kaladin’s mother entered a\nshort time later, hairs escaping her bun and blood on her skirt. Not hers.\nProbably Jam’s.\nShe went to hug Lirin while Kaladin sat staring at the floor. Urithiru\nmight continue to fight, but he knew that it had lost the battle long ago.\nLike Kaladin himself.\nMy instincts say that the power of Odium is not being controlled well.\nThe Vessel will be adapted to the power’s will. And after this long, if\nOdium is still seeking to destroy, then it is because of the power.\nBy the time Navani neared the map room, the area was already a bustle of\nactivity. The runners had done their jobs, and she found checkpoints in\nplace in the hallways, attended by guards, with anticipationspren streaming\noverhead. The soldiers at each one waved her through with visible relief.\nThe map room was lit by a large number of diamond spheres. A\nsmattering of officers in Kholin blue stood with some functionaries. Roion\n—the youngest highprince, and the only one in the tower currently—had\ngathered them around the tables. Here, maps of the lower levels had been\nunrolled and weighted at the corners."

Here, maps of the lower levels had been\nunrolled and weighted at the corners.\nCaptains mostly, she thought, reading the shoulder knots of her\ncommand staff. One battalionlord. Men who had been here on leave.\nVarious runners, both male and female, hovered at the perimeters of the\nchamber.\n“Do we have word of Commander Lyon?” Navani asked as she strode in.\n“We’d best have the head of the Tower Guard here.”\n“He’s fallen unconscious, Brightness,” said one of the men. “He had a\nspren choose him last month.…”\n“Storms,” Navani said, stepping up to the table as several men made\nroom for her. “It’s true then? Every Radiant in the tower?”\n“As far as we can tell, Brightness,” one of the men said.\n“There are enemy troops on every floor, Brightness,” said an older man,\nthe battalionlord. “Stormform Regals, mostly. Pouring in through the\nbasement. But there are Heavenly Ones landing on balconies all up and\ndown the lower levels.”\n“Damnation,” she muttered. The enemy had the library rooms then. And\nthe pillar. Was that where the Sibling resided?\nShe glanced at the battalionlord again. A lean, balding man with close-\ncropped hair, a thick neck despite his age, and a powerfully intense stare.\nHe …\nShe did a double take. Darkeyed? Dalinar had made good on his decision\nto begin promoting based on merit, not eye shade, but there still weren’t\nmany darkeyed officers. Strangely, some darkeyes seemed to consider the\nchange as unnatural as some of the more high-minded lighteyes did.\n“Your name, Battalionlord?” she asked.\n“Teofil,” he said. “Ninth Kholin Division, infantry. We just came in off\nthe lines in southern Alethkar. I put my men at the stairwell here.” He\npointed at the map. “But … Brightness, they got the drop on us, and there\naren’t many of our troops in the tower. First floor was halfway overrun by\nthe time we mobilized.”\n“We can’t fight Fused,” said another man, young and nervous, his hand\nshaking as he pointed at a map of the sixth floor. “They’re trapping us from\nboth above and below. There’s no way to hold them. They heal when cut,\nand they can strike from above. Without Radiants, we’re doomed. There’s\nno—”\n“Calm down,” Navani said. “Brightlord Teofil is right to have…” Navani\npaused. He was a darkeyes, not a brightlord. What did you call a\nbattalionlord who wasn’t a lighteyes? “Er, Battalionlord Teofil is correct.\nWe need to plug the stairwells. The shanay-im’s ability to fly won’t matter\nin such tight quarters. With proper barricades, it won’t even matter that they\ncan heal. We can try to hold the second through fifth floors.”\n“Brightness,” another man said. “We can try—but there are dozens of\nstairwells, and not a lot of materials for barricades.”"

The\nSoulcasters—”\n“—don’t work, like the other fabrials.”\nDamnation. “We have garrison stores?” she asked, hopeful.\n“I’ve sent men to recover them,” Teofil said, pointing at a map of the\nthird floor. “Dumps are here and here.”\n“With those, we can hold for weeks,” Navani said. “Plenty of time for\nmy husband to return with our forces.”\nThe officers looked at one another. Her scribes, clustered near the\ndoorway, stood quietly. After her furious rush to get here—often pushing\nthrough confused crowds—it felt unnerving to be in such silence. She\nalmost felt as if the entire tower were bearing down on top of her.\n“Brightness,” Teofil said. “They pushed straight for the plateau outside.\nThey have the Oathgates—and are working them somehow, though other\nfabrials aren’t functioning. Singers will soon flood this tower. But\ndisregarding that, I don’t think barricades would be a prudent strategy.\n“Yes, I plugged the stairwells to slow them, but they have stormforms,\nand I have reports of Fused who can move through stone. They’ll blast and\nburn away what we put in front of them. If you want us to hold, we’ll hold\nas long as we can—but I want to make certain you understand the situation\nfully. In case you want to consider a different plan.”\nHalls above. She pressed her hands against the table, forcing order upon\nher thoughts. Don’t feel like you need to decide everything, she told herself.\nYou’re not a general.\n“Advice?” she asked.\n“Surrender is distasteful,” Teofil said, “but might be our best option. My\nsoldiers are brave, and I vouch for them—but they cannot stand for long\nagainst Regals and Fused. Can you think of any way to restore the\nRadiants?”\nShe eyed the maps. “I suspect whatever the enemy did to the Radiants\nhas to do with a specific construction of garnets in the crystal pillar. If we\ncan retake that room, I might be able to reverse all this. I can’t guarantee\nanything, but it’s my best guess and probably our best hope.”\n“That would mean reclaiming part of the first floor,” Teofil said. “We’d\nhave to push down the stairs into the basement…”\nNearby, other officers shuffled and muttered at that idea. Teofil met\nNavani’s eyes and nodded. He didn’t advise standing in a hopeless fight\nagainst a superior enemy. But if she could offer a chance of success, even\nwith a difficult gamble, that was different.\n“That will be bloody,” a soldier said. “We’ll have to advance on the\nposition of enemy Surgebinders.”"

Either we seize the\nbasement, or … that’s it.”\nNavani looked over the maps again, determined to think this through,\nthough each minute she debated would make their task that much more\ndifficult.\nTeofil is right, she decided. This tower is too porous to hold for long\nagainst an enemy with powers. Trying to hold these center rooms wouldn’t\nwork. The enemy would be electrocuting men in large batches, breaking\nformations, terrifying her troops.\nShe had to strike before everyone in the tower started feeling like that\nfrightened captain. Before the enemy momentum grew too large to\novercome.\nThey had one hope. Move now.\n“Do it,” she ordered. “Throw everything we have into recovering that\npillar in the basement.”\nAgain the room fell silent. Then Teofil barked, “You heard the queen!\nShuanor, Gavri, grab your men from the upper floors! Withdraw, leaving\nonly a harrying force to cover the retreat. Radathavian, you command that.\nWithdraw slowly, making those Heavenly Ones bleed as they have to\nadvance on you. Fused might heal, but they still hurt.\n“The rest of you, pull your men to the foot of the grand staircase. We’ll\nmuster there, then make our push! We will carve a hole to the basement\nsteps, then fight down and clear a path for the queen. By the blood of our\nfathers!”\nThey scrambled into motion, the various lesser officers calling for\nrunners to deliver orders. Navani didn’t miss their delayed response. They’d\nmoved only after hearing the command from Teofil. These soldiers would\nfall over themselves to do her bidding when it came to peacetime requests,\nbut during a fight …\nNavani glanced at Teofil, who leaned in next to her and spoke in a soft\nvoice. “Pardon them, Brightness,” he said. “They likely don’t much like\nfollowing a woman’s orders. Masculine arts and all that.”\n“And you?” she asked.\n“I figure the Blackthorn has studied every military text known to man,”\nhe said. “And we could do worse for a general than the person who likely\nread ’em to him. Particularly if she’s willing to listen to a little sense. That’s\nmore than I can say for some highlords I’ve followed.”\n“Thank you,” she said.\n“What we needed most was for someone to make the decision,” he said.\n“Before you came, they were all balking at doing what I wanted. Storming\nfools. Almost anyone worth his Stormlight is on the front lines somewhere,\nBrightness.”\nHe glanced at the others as they sent runners with orders. Then he spoke\neven softer to Navani. “We’ve got some solid troops mixed among them\nhere, but many of these are Roion’s men.

Those Heavenly Ones went straight for him, Brightness.\nMust have known exactly where his quarters were. The enemy has his Plate\nnow; may the Almighty accept his soul to the eternal battlefield.”\nNavani breathed out. Taravangian must have told the enemy where to\nfind the Shardbearer.\n“There might be one other Shard we could take,” Teofil said, gesturing\ntoward a spot on the third-floor map. “A black Blade. Speaks to people\nwhen they come close…”\n“The assassin in that cell is a Lightweaving,” Navani whispered. “We\nsent the real man with my husband in secret, and he took the sword with\nhim.”\n“Damnation,” Teofil muttered.\n“What are our chances, Battalionlord?” she asked. “Our actual chances,\nin your estimation?”\n“Brightness,” he said, “I’ve tried fielding regular troops against Regals.\nIt doesn’t go well—and it will be worse here. Normally these close quarters\nwould benefit us fighting defensively. But in corridors we’re limited to\nsmall clashes of squads. And if their squads can throw lightning…”\n“I came to the same conclusion,” she said. “Do you think this order of\nmine foolish?”\nHe slowly shook his head. “Brightness, if there’s a chance to turn this\ntide right now, I think we need to take it. We lose the tower, and … well, it\nwill be a disaster for the war. If there is even a possibility you can wake the\nRadiants, I’ll risk everyone we have on that chance.”\n“Try this push, then,” she said. “But if it doesn’t work … I need to know\nhow the enemy is treating the people on the upper floors as we withdraw the\ntroops. Think you can have a scout find that out for me?”\nHe nodded, and she read understanding in his expression. Fused usually\noccupied rather than destroyed. Honestly, they generally treated the cities\nthey took better than her fellow Alethi might have during a squabble\nbetween highprinces.\nAs much as she hated it, surrender was an option. As long as she was\nsure the enemy wasn’t intending to make a slaughter of this attack.\nThey’d tried something like this once before, but then it had been only a\nraid—intended to slow down the Alethi reinforcements and to steal the\nHonorblade. She had a worse feeling about today’s attack. They seemed to\nknow about the Sibling—and how to disrupt the tower’s defenses.\n“I’m going to try something with the tower’s fabrials,” Navani said. “It\nmight help us. Take command, see our plan put into action. Bring me\nanything of significance before you make a decision, please. Assuming\nyou’re still willing to take orders from a woman.”\n“Brightness,” he said, “before my promotion, I spent years taking orders\nfrom every fuzz-faced teenage lieutenant who decided to make a name for\nhimself on the Shattered Plains. Trust me when I say I consider this to be an\nhonor.”\nHe saluted her, then turned and began barking further orders. As he did,\nNavani noted the Bridge Four man named Dabbid slinking into the room."

As he did,\nNavani noted the Bridge Four man named Dabbid slinking into the room.\nPeople didn’t give him much more than a quick glance. The way he walked,\nwith his eyes down, cringing when someone brushed past, was reminiscent\nof a servant, or … well, of how parshmen used to be. Invisible, to an extent.\nIt was good to know he had arrived in case what she was about to try\ndidn’t work. Navani walked up to the vein of crystal on the wall. It was\nmore obvious in this room—a line of red garnet slicing the wall in half,\ninterrupting the natural pattern of the strata. Navani rested her hand against\nit.\n“I know you can hear, Sibling,” Navani said softly. “Dabbid told me you\ncould—but it was clear to me anyway. You knew where to place those\nrubies, and you knew when I’d lost one. You’ve been listening in on us the\nentire time, haven’t you? Spying? How else would you know that I’m the\none who leads the fabrial scholars in the tower?”\nAs she finished speaking, she noted something: a small twinkle of light,\nlike a starspren, moving up through the line of crystal. She forced herself to\nkeep her fingers in place as it touched her skin.\nI can hear you, a voice said in her mind—quiet, like a whisper. She\ncouldn’t tell if it was male or female. It seemed pitched between the two.\nThough I do not see all that you assume I do. Regardless, Dabbid should\nnot have spoken of this.\n“Be glad he did,” Navani whispered. “I want to help.”\nYou are a slaver, the Sibling said.\n“Am I better than a Fused?”\nThe Sibling didn’t respond at first. I’m not sure, they said. I have avoided\nyour kind. You were supposed to think I was dead. Everyone was supposed\nto think I was dead.\n“I’m glad you’re not. You said you were the soul of the tower. Can you\nrestore its functions?”\nNo, the voice said. I really was asleep. Until … a Bondsmith. I felt a\nBondsmith. But the tower is not functional, and I have not the Light to\nrestart it.\n“If that is true, then how have they done what they have to the\nRadiants?”\nI … They have corrupted me. A little part of me. They used their Light to\nactivate defenses I could not.\n“Is what they did related to that construction of garnets in your crystal\npillar?”\nYou know too much, the Sibling said. It makes me uncomfortable. You\nknow and do things that weren’t possible before.\n“They were possible, they simply weren’t known,” Navani said. “That is\nthe nature of science.”\nWhat you do is dangerous and evil, the Sibling said. Those ancient\nRadiants gave up their oaths because they worried they had too much\npower—and you have gone far beyond them.\n“I am willing to listen to you,” Navani said. “Willing to change. But if\nthe Fused take the tower, corrupt it…”\nThe … Lady of Pains is here, the Sibling said, voice growing softer."

        "text": "the Fused take the tower, corrupt it…”\nThe … Lady of Pains is here, the Sibling said, voice growing softer.\nMore frightened? It sounded like a child’s voice, Navani decided.\n“I don’t know who that is,” Navani said.\nShe is bad. Terrible. Few Fused are as … frightening to me as she is.\nShe’s trying to change me. So far, she changed only the portion of me that\nsuppresses Surgebinding, reversing it so it affects Radiants instead of\nFused. But she intends to go further. Much further.\n“Is there a way to rescue our Radiants other than recovering the pillar?”\nNo, the Sibling said. Get to the pillar, and we could reverse the effects.\nBut otherwise … no. Those highly Invested might not be as strongly\naffected. Unmade, for example, were sometimes able to push through my\nsuppression. Radiants of the high oaths might be able to access their\npowers. And Honor’s Truest Surge, the Surge of Binding and Oaths, could\nstill work.\n“What can I do to help?” Navani said. “We’re mounting an assault to try\nto recapture the pillar heart. Is there something else I could try? Earlier you\ntold me I needed to infuse something—but were cut off before you could\nfinish.”\nThe Lady of Pains is returning, the Sibling said. I think … I think she’s\ngoing to change me. My mind might alter. I might not care.\n“Do you care now?” Navani asked, urgent.\nYes. The voice seemed very small.\n“Tell me what to do.”\nLong ago, before I banished men from these halls, my last Bondsmith\nmade me something. A method of protecting me from the dangers I saw in\nmen. He thought it would help me trust again. It did not. But it might stop\nthe Fused from corrupting me further.\n“Please,” Navani said. “Let me help. Please.”\nYou cannot be trusted.\n“Let me show you that I can.”\nI … You will need Stormlight, Navani Kholin. A great deal of Stormlight.\nOf course, I admit this is a small quibble. A difference of semantics\nmore than anything.\nVenli wasn’t required to fight unless she was attacked. A part of her wanted\nto go up above and look for Leshwi, who would have arrived by now with\nthe other Heavenly Ones. But no, that was foolish. Even if being near\nLeshwi would help make sense of all this. Leshwi seemed to see so much\nmore clearly than other Fused.\nRegardless, as their troops marched up the steps to assault the first floors\nof the tower city, Venli stayed with Raboniel in the basement. The Lady of\nWishes didn’t seem terribly nervous about the invasion. She strolled along\nthe wide hallway here, inspecting its murals. Venli stayed at her side as\ndirected, and realized the reason she’d been brought along. Raboniel\nwanted a servant at hand.\n“Does this strike you as a particularly human form of decoration, Last\nListener?” Raboniel asked her, speaking to Craving as she stood with her\nhands before her, fingertips touching the large mural, this portion of which\ndepicted Cultivation in the shape of a tree."

        "text": "Listener?” Raboniel asked her, speaking to Craving as she stood with her\nhands before her, fingertips touching the large mural, this portion of which\ndepicted Cultivation in the shape of a tree.\n“I … I don’t know humans well enough to say, Ancient One.”\nSounds echoed from the stairwell at the opposite end of this hallway\nfrom the pillar room. Screams. Calls of horror. Clashes of weapon against\nweapon. By now the shanay-im would have arrived by air, delivering some\nof the most terrible and capable Fused to the sixth floor.\n“To me it seems obvious,” Raboniel said. “Humans never use what is\naround them to its fullest. They always impose their will far too strongly.\nThough the shells of beasts and the colors of stone would offer striking\nvariety for creating complex murals, the humans ignored natural materials.\nInstead they painted each square, then affixed it to this wall.\n“One of the singers of old, creating a similar work of art, would have\ndivided the bits of shell into a spectrum of colors. They would have asked\nthemself what kind of mural would naturally be suggested by the pieces\nthey had obtained. Their mural would have used no paint, and would have\nlasted millennia longer than this one. See how the colors here fade.”\nA hulking form darkened the other end of the hallway, near the stairwell.\nThe Pursuer looked like a dark scar of black and red upon the light stone.\nAs he moved forward, Venli found herself trembling. Surely this was the\nmost dangerous Fused in all the army.\n“I have your leave,” the Pursuer said to Raboniel, “to find this\nWindrunner and kill him?”\n“Him alone,” Raboniel said. “If he is here. There’s a good chance one of\nhis skill went with the others to Azir.”\n“If he is not here, he will return to try to liberate the tower,” the Pursuer\nsaid. “It is in his nature.” He turned, looking upward through the stone.\n“The Radiants we capture are dangerous. They have skill beyond what we\nanticipated, considering the newness of their bonds. We should behead\nthem, each and every one.”\n“No,” Raboniel said. “I will need them. Your orders are the same as what\nI told the others: Kill only those who resist. Gather the fallen Radiants for\nme. On my orders, you are to show … restraint.”\nThe Pursuer hummed—loudly and forcefully—to Craving. “You, who\nwere once banished for recklessly endangering our kind in your attempts to\nexterminate humankind? You, Lady of Wishes, ask for restraint?”\nRaboniel smiled and hummed softly another rhythm that Venli had never\nheard. Something brand new. Something incredible. Dark, dangerous,\npredatory, and beautiful. It implied destruction, but a quiet and deadly\ndestruction.\nOdium had granted this femalen her own rhythms.\nNo, Venli thought, the Pursuer is not the most dangerous of them.\n“I care not for a single battle,” Raboniel said. “We will end this war,\nPursuer. Forever. We have spent far, far too long in an endless cycle. I will\nbreak it—and once I am finished in this tower, there will be no turning"

You will help in this, and you will start by collecting the fallen\nRadiants and delivering them to me.”\n“I may kill the one, when I find him?” he repeated. “You relieve the\nNine’s prohibition upon me?”\n“Yes,” Raboniel said. “You may claim your prize and keep your custom,\nPursuer. I take responsibility for this order.”\nHe hummed to Destruction and stalked off.\n“If Stormblessed is here in the tower, he’ll be helpless when you find\nhim, Pursuer!” Venli called. “You would murder an enemy who cannot\nresist you?”\n“Tradition is more important than honor, foolish one,” the Pursuer called\nback to Derision. “I must kill those who have killed me. I have always\nkilled those who have killed me.”\nHe transformed into a ribbon of red light, leaving behind a lifeless husk,\nand shot out into the stairwell so he could fly to the upper levels.\nTimbre pulsed uncertainly in Venli’s chest. Yes … she was right. The\nPursuer did have a madness to him. It wasn’t as obvious as in the other\nFused—the ones who would grin and refuse to speak, their eyes seeming to\nstare without seeing. It was there nonetheless. Perhaps this Pursuer had\nlived so long that his traditions had taken control of his reason. He was like\na spren, existing more than living.\nTimbre pulsed at that. She didn’t think she existed without living, and\nVenli was forced to apologize. Still, she worried that all the Fused were like\nhim. Maybe not mad—maybe that was the wrong word for it, and\ndisrespectful to people who were themselves mad. The Fused instead\nseemed more like people who had lived so long thinking one way that they\nhad come to accept their opinions as the natural state of things.\nVenli had been like that once.\n“So telling,” Raboniel said to Thoughtfulness, still regarding the murals.\n“Humans take as their own everything they see. Yet they do not understand\nthat by holding so tightly, they cause the very thing they desired to crumble.\nThey truly are children of Honor.”\nRaboniel turned from the mural and strolled farther down the hallway,\napproaching an intersection where doors opened on either side. These led\ninto chambers with tables, bookshelves, stacks of paper. Venli followed\nRaboniel into one of them, then hurried—at a wave of her fingers, a gesture\nVenli’s translation powers interpreted—to fetch a cup of wine from the\nstation at the side of the room.\nVenli passed huddled scholars and monks, sitting on the floor by the wall\nbeneath the watchful eyes of a few Regal stormforms. The poor humans\nwere surrounded by fearspren, though Venli had to remind herself that no\nhuman could ever be completely trusted. They didn’t have forms.

And wear a form that didn’t express\nthe spren she truly followed.\nTimbre pulsed in satisfaction.\nDon’t make this harder than it already is, Venli thought, hastening to\nRaboniel. I’m not here to help the humans. I can barely help my own kind.\nShe delivered Raboniel’s wine as the tall Fused was inspecting a\ncontraption of metal and gemstones. A human fabrial delivered by one of\nthe Deepest Ones.\n“What should we make of this?” the Deepest One asked to Craving. “I\nhave never seen its like before. How can the humans have discovered things\nwe never knew about?”\n“They have always been clever,” Raboniel said to Derision. “We merely\nleft them alone too long this time. Go and interrogate the scholars. I would\nfind out who leads their studies here.”\nThe Fused glanced upward.\n“The conquest will happen easily,” Raboniel said to Conceit. “By now,\nthe shanay-im have used Vyre to activate the Oathgate, bringing our troops.\nLet us stay focused while they work.”\n“Yes, Lady of Wishes,” the Deepest One said, gliding off.\nRaboniel absently took the cup from Venli’s hands. She turned the fabrial\nover in her hand, and hummed softly to … to Subservience?\nShe’s impressed, Venli realized. And she’s keeping most of the scholars\nalive—along with the Radiants. She wants something from this tower.\n“You don’t care about the conquest,” Venli guessed, speaking to Craving.\n“You aren’t here to further the war or to dominate the humans. You’re here\nbecause of these things. The fabrials humans are creating.”\nRaboniel hummed to Command. “Yes, Leshwi does pick the best,\ndoesn’t she?” She held out the fabrial, letting the light catch it. “Do you\nknow what the humans gain by being so forceful? By reaching to seize\nbefore they are ready? Yes, their works crumble. Yes, their nations collapse\nfrom within. Yes, they end up squabbling, and fighting, and killing one\nanother.\n“But in the moment, they are the sprinter who outpaces the steady\nrunner. In the moment, they create wonders. One cannot fault their audacity.\nTheir imagination. Surely you’ve noticed that the Fused have a problem.\nWe think along the same old, familiar pathways. We don’t create because\nwe assume we’ve already created what we need to. We are immortal, and so\nthink nothing can ever surprise us—and that makes us complacent.”\nVenli hummed to Abashment, realizing she’d been thinking that same\nthing.\n“That is the reason this war is eternal,” Raboniel said. “They cannot hold\nor exploit that which they create, but we cannot stretch far enough to come\nup with anything new. If we truly want an end, it will take a partnership.”"

If we truly want an end, it will take a partnership.”\n“I do not think the Alethi will partner with you,” Venli said. “Like the\nIriali have.”\n“They can be guided,” Raboniel said. She glanced at Venli, then smiled\nagain, humming her new rhythm. Her individual dangerous rhythm. “If\nthere is one thing I can guarantee you about humankind, Last Listener, it is\nthis: Provide them with a sword, and they will find a way to impale\nthemselves upon it.”\n* * *\nThe stench of burned flesh assaulted Navani as she entered the ground floor\nof Urithiru. She hoped that most of the civilians had been able to flee to the\nupper floors, for what she saw now seemed nothing short of Damnation\nitself. The large foyer in front of the grand staircase was empty save for a\nfew scattered corpses. Burned. Human.\nThe thick, pungent scent made her want to retch.\nRed lights flashed in the near hallways, and cracks of thunder echoed off\nthe stone. Loud, sharp, and unnatural. One shouldn’t be able to hear thunder\nin these hallways, buried beneath a million tons of stone and a ten-minute\nwalk to the perimeter.\nBetween the peals of thunder, Navani was certain she heard distant\nmoans and cries. Her kingdom had become a war zone. What scout reports\nshe received spoke of fragmented squads of soldiers desperately holding out\nbefore nightmares moving in quick roving bands. They thought the singers\nwere securing points of strategic value, but their information was too\ndisjointed to get a full picture of the enemy’s plans.\nStorms … they’d become so dependent on spanreeds. It felt downright\nprimitive to lack knowledge of enemy movements. Navani moved through\nthe foyer, urging her band of scholars, ardents, and engineers to follow.\nThey balked, remaining in a cluster on the wide steps. She glanced back and\nsaw many staring in horror at the burned corpses on the ground.\nRight. Few of her current attendants had ever been subjected to real\nbattlefields. They had worked the warcamps, had designed bridges and\nflying platforms, but they weren’t the types who saw corpses in anything\nother than a sanitized funeral service.\nNavani remembered being like that. Before Gavilar. He’d always\npromised that a unified Alethkar would be a wonderful blessing to all the\npeople of the land. With him around, it always had been easier to rationalize\nthe price in blood.\nRegardless of their feelings, they had to keep moving. They’d given\nBattalionlord Teofil an hour to gather his assault force and send some initial\nsallies to clear the landing. During that time Navani had gathered as much\nStormlight as she could. Her attendants carried the spheres and gemstones\nin large bags.\nThe wait had let Navani send for two specific women. They stood near\nthe center of the huddle of attendants: Thaylen scholars from Queen Fen’s\ncourt who were visiting the tower to listen to Navani’s lectures. They’d\ncome to her command post willingly, probably believing that Navani had\nsent for them because she wanted to protect them during the invasion. Their\npanicked glances now showed they were beginning to question those\nassumptions."

Their\npanicked glances now showed they were beginning to question those\nassumptions.\nA soldier stood guarding the way through a particular hallway. Navani\nhurried in that direction, leaving her attendants behind for now. She entered\na large open hall that in times past they’d used as a meeting place. Some\nfive hundred soldiers crowded the corners and a couple of side corridors.\nNot fully out of sight, but obscured enough for their purpose. Other than the\nnumerous crossbowmen among them, the items of most interest were two\nlarge metal pillars on wheels.\nTeofil noticed her and stepped over. “Brightness,” he said. “I’d be more\ncomfortable if you waited closer to the steps.”\n“Objection noted,” Navani said. “How does it look?”\n“I’ve gathered our best veterans,” he said. “This will be bloody work,\nbut I think we have a chance. The enemy is relying on the Regals to seize\nthe ground floor. I keep reminding the men that as frightening as the enemy\npowers are, the ones using them have only a year of training.”\nThe human advantage had so far been their experience. Parshmen newly\nawakened from their lives of slavery were no replacement for battle-\nhardened troops. This advantage was slowly being worn away as enemy\ntroops gained more and more practical combat experience.\nAn exhausted messenger dashed into the room from the hallway directly\nacross from Navani—the hallway leading toward the steps to the basement.\nThe messenger nodded to Teofil before moving to the side and putting her\nhands on her knees, breathing in deep gasps.\nTeofil gestured for Navani to retreat, and she moved to the mouth of the\ncorridor. She didn’t retreat farther than that, so Teofil stoically walked over\nand handed her some wax and pointed at his ears. Then he fell into position,\nsword out, with one group of soldiers.\nA controlled retreat was difficult enough, but what they were trying here\n—a fake rout leading to an ambush—was even trickier. You had to bait the\nenemy into thinking you were fleeing, and that involved turning your backs\non them. A trickle of human soldiers soon came running into the room, and\ntheir panic seemed real to Navani. It probably was. The line between a feint\nand a true collapse of morale was thin as a sheet of paper.\nThe trickle of soldiers became a flood. Fleeing men, chased by flashes of\nlight and thunder that made Navani hastily stuff her ears with the wax. She\nspared a moment of grief for the slowest of the fleeing soldiers, who sold\nthis ruse with their lives, dying in a bright flash of lightning.\nThe chasing Regals soon charged into the room: wicked-looking singers\nwith pointed carapace and glowing red eyes. Teofil waited longer than\nNavani would have to give the order to loose—he wanted as many Regals\nin the room as possible. The pause was long enough that the first of the\nenemies had time to stop, then raise arms crackling with electric energy.\nNavani braced herself as they released flashes of light toward the waiting\nsoldiers. Those flashes, however, struck the carefully placed metal pillars,\nwhich drew the lightning like tall trees might in an open field."

Those flashes, however, struck the carefully placed metal pillars,\nwhich drew the lightning like tall trees might in an open field.\nTeofil gave the order with a raised piece of red cloth—though Navani\nbarely saw it, as she was blinking blinded eyes. Crossbows loosed in wave\nafter deadly wave, cutting down the Regals—who didn’t have the same\npower to heal themselves that the Fused possessed.\n“Hoist those lightning rods!” Teofil shouted, his voice sounding muted to\nher ears. “Move, men! Stay away from blood on the ground. We push for\nthe basement!”\nAs quickly as that, the “rout” reversed, and human troops piled into the\nhallway to chase the remaining Regals. Teofil left her with a salute. He set\nout on a near-impossible task: to push down a long stairwell into the\nbasement, harried by Regals and Fused. If Navani wasn’t able to get to him\nafter he reached the pillar, he was to destroy the construction of garnets that\nsuppressed Radiant powers. The Sibling indicated this would be effective at\nrestoring the Radiants.\nIn the meantime, Navani’s job was to activate the Sibling’s fail-safe. She\nhurried to collect her scribes, hoping they wouldn’t balk too much at\nclimbing over the corpses.\n* * *\nKaladin ducked into a room, carrying an armful of blankets. He didn’t\nrecognize the young family inside—father, mother, two toddlers—so they\nhad to be refugees who had fled to Hearthstone.\nThe young family had done much to make this small, windowless room\ntheir own. Both walls were covered in Herdazian sand paintings, and the\nfloor was painted in a large and intricate glyph.\nKaladin didn’t like the way they cringed as he entered, the children\nwhimpering. If you don’t want people to cringe when they see you, he\nthought, act less like a ruffian and more like a surgeon. He never had\npossessed his father’s gentle grace, that unassuming way that wasn’t weak,\nbut also rarely seemed threatening.\n“Sorry,” Kaladin said, shutting the door behind him. “I know you were\nexpecting my father. You wanted blankets?”\n“Yes,” the wife said, rising and taking them from him. “Thank you. It\ncold.”\n“I know,” Kaladin said. “Something’s wrong with the tower, so heating\nfabrials aren’t working.”\nThe man said something in Herdazian. Syl, sitting on Kaladin’s shoulder,\nwhispered the interpretation—but the woman translated right afterward\nanyway.\n“Dark ones in the corridors,” the woman said. “They … are staying?”\n“We don’t know yet,” Kaladin said. “For now, it’s best to remain in your\nrooms. Here, I brought water and some rations. Soulcast, I’m afraid. We’ll\nsend someone around tomorrow to gather chamber pots, if it comes to that.”\nHe slung his pack onto his shoulder after getting out the food and water.\nThen he slipped back out into the corridor. He had three more rooms to visit\nbefore meeting up with his father. “What time is it?” he asked Syl."

He knew that fighting was still going on far below, that Navani was\nholding out. The enemy, however, had quickly secured this floor, leaving\nguards and pushing downward to press against the Alethi defenders.\nSo while the tower wasn’t yet lost, Kaladin’s floor felt quiet. Syl turned\naround and lifted into the air, shimmering and becoming formless like a\ncloud. “I keep seeing things, Kaladin. Streaks of red. Voidspren I think,\npatrolling the halls.”\n“You can see them even if they’re invisible to humans, right?”\nShe nodded. “But they can see me too. My cognitive aspect.”\nA part of him wanted to ask further. Why, for instance, could Rock\nalways see her? Was he somehow part spren? Lift seemed to be able to do it\ntoo, though she wouldn’t speak about it. So was she part Horneater? The\nother Edgedancers didn’t have the ability.\nThe questions wouldn’t form on his lips. He was distracted, and honestly\nhe was exhausted. He let the thoughts slip away as he moved to the next\nroom on his list. These ones would probably be extra frightened, having not\nheard anything since—\n“Kaladin,” Syl hissed.\nHe stopped immediately, then looked up, noting a stormform Regal\nwalking down the hallway with a sphere lantern in one hand, a sword on his\nhip. “You there,” he said, speaking with a rhythm, but otherwise no hint of\nan accent. “Why are you out of your rooms?”\n“I’m a surgeon,” Kaladin said. “I was told by one of the Fused that I\ncould check on our people. I’m delivering food and water.”\nThe singer sized him up, then waved for him to open his pack and show\nwhat was inside. Kaladin obliged, and didn’t look toward Syl, who was\ndoing her windspren act—flitting about and pretending she didn’t belong\nwith a Radiant—just in case.\nThe singer inspected the rations, then studied Kaladin.\nLooking at my arms, my chest, Kaladin thought. Wondering why a\nsurgeon is built like a soldier. At least his brands were covered by his long\nhair.\n“Return to your rooms,” the man said.\n“The others will be frightened,” Kaladin said. “You could have hysterical\npeople on your hands—chaos that would interfere with your troops.”\n“And how often did you check on the parshmen of your village, when\nthey were frightened?” the singer asked. “When they were forced into dark\nrooms, locked away and ignored? Did you spare any concern for them,\nsurgeon?”\nKaladin bit off a response. This wasn’t the kind of taunt where the\nspeaker wanted an answer. Instead he looked down.\nThe singer, in turn, stepped forward and snapped his hand at Kaladin to\nstrike him. Kaladin moved without thinking, raising his hand to catch the\nsinger’s wrist before it connected. He felt a small jolt of something when he\ntouched the carapace-backed hand."

But you can ask anyone in this town\nif I’m the surgeon’s son, and they’ll confirm it.”\nThe singer shoved at Kaladin’s hand, trying to throw him off balance,\nbut Kaladin’s stance was solid. He met the red eyes, and saw the smile in\nthem. The eagerness. This creature wanted a fight. Likely he was angry he’d\nbeen posted to something as boring as patrolling halls on what was to have\nbeen a daring and dangerous mission. He’d love nothing more than to have\nan excuse for a little excitement.\nKaladin’s grip tightened on the man’s hand. His heartbeat sped up, and\nhe found himself reaching for the Stormlight at his belt. Draw in a breath,\nsuck it in, end this farce. Enemies were invading the tower, and he was\ndelivering blankets?\nHe held those red eyes with his own. He heard his heart thundering.\nThen he forced himself to look away and let the singer shove him into the\nwall, then trip him with a sweep to his legs. The creature loomed over him,\nand Kaladin kept his eyes down. You learned to do that, when you were a\nslave.\nThe creature snorted and stomped away without another word, leaving\nKaladin. He felt tense, alert, like he often did before a battle—his fatigue\nwashed away. He wanted to act.\nInstead he continued on his way, delivering comfort to the people of\nHearthstone.\nIn truth, it would be a combination of a Vessel’s craftiness and the\npower’s Intent that we should fear most.\nNavani and her timid attendants soon left the broad hallway scattered with\ncorpses and entered a series of corridors with darkened lanterns on the\nwalls. The broken latches bespoke thieves with crowbars getting at the\nspheres inside. For some people, no nightmare was terrible enough—no war\nbloody enough—to discourage some creative personal enrichment.\nThe sounds of screams and echoes of thunder faded. Navani felt as if she\nwere entering the mythical centerbeat—the heart of a highstorm spoken of\nby some poor wanderers trapped within its winds. A moment when for\nreasons inexplicable, the wind stopped and all became still.\nShe eventually reached the place where the Sibling had told her to go—a\nspecific intersection among these twisting corridors. Though no part of the\nfirst level went completely unused, this area was among the least trafficked.\nThe corridors here made a maze of frustrating design, and they used the\nsmall rooms for various storage dumps.\n“Now what?” asked Elthebar, the stormwarden. Navani wasn’t\nparticularly happy to have the tall man along; he looked silly with his\npointed beard and his mysterious robes. But he’d been in the map room\nwith them, and forbidding him hadn’t seemed right when she needed every\nmind she could get.\n“Search this area,” Navani said to the others. “See if you can find a vein\nof garnet on the walls.

It might be small and hidden among the changing\ncolors of the strata.”\nThey did as she requested. Dabbid, the mute bridgeman, started\nsearching the floor instead of the walls—working with his sphere enclosed\nentirely in his hand so it gave almost no light.\n“Cover up your spheres and lanterns,” Navani said to the others. The\ncommand drew expressions that ranged between confused and horrified, but\nNavani led the way, closing the shield on her lantern.\nThe others obeyed one at a time, plunging the room into darkness. Light\nfrom a distant corridor flashed red in a sequence—only with no thunder. A\nfew people’s hands glowed softly from the spheres inside, backlighting\nveins and bones.\n“There,” Navani said, picking out a faint twinkling on the floor near one\nof the walls. They clustered around it, investigating the spark of garnet light\nin a hidden vein of crystal.\n“What is it?” Isabi asked. “What kind of spren?”\nThe light started moving through the vein, across the floor, then down\nthe corridor. Navani ignored the questions, following the spark until it\nmoved up a wall. Here it followed the curving strata into a specific room,\nrounding the stone and slipping through the gap between door and doorway.\nVenan had keys, fortunately. Inside, they had to step over rolled rugs to\nfind the spark of light at the rear. Navani brushed her fingers against it and\nfound a small bulge in the wall.\nA gemstone, she realized. Connected to the line of crystal. It’s embedded\nin here so deeply, it’s difficult to see. Seemed to be a topaz. Hadn’t there\nbeen a similar gemstone embedded into the wall of that room where they’d\nfound the model of the tower?\nInfuse the topaz, the Sibling’s voice said in her mind. You can do this\nwithout Radiants? I have seen you perform such marvels.\n“I need several small topazes,” Navani said to her scholars. “No larger\nthan three kivs each.”\nHer team scrambled; they kept gemstones of all sizes on hand for their\nexperiments, and one soon brought forth a small case of infused topazes.\nNavani instructed her and several others to take the gemstones in tweezers\nand present them to the topaz set into the wall.\nAn infused gemstone touched to an uninfused one could be made to lend\nsome of its Stormlight—assuming they were the same variety, and the\nuninfused gemstone was much larger than the infused ones. It worked a\nlittle like a pressure differential. A large empty vessel would take Stormlight\nfrom small full vessels.\nIt was a slow process, especially when the gemstone you wanted to\ninfuse was relatively small—limiting the potential size differential. She\nmoved up next to Ulvlk and Vrandl, the two Thaylen scholars. Both were\nartifabrians of a very secretive guild.\n“Almighty send we can make this work in time,” Navani said as thunder\nechoed behind them.\n“So that is why you brought us,” Vrandl said. She was a short woman"

She was a short woman\nwho preferred havahs to traditional Thaylen dress. She wore her eyebrows\nin tight curls. “The tower is invaded, your men are dying, and you see an\nopportunity to pry trade secrets from our fingers?”\n“The world is ending,” Navani countered, “and our greatest advantage—\nthis tower, with its ability to instantly move troops from one end of Roshar\nto the other—is threatened. Is this really the time to hoard trade secrets,\nBrightness?”\nThe two women didn’t reply.\n“You’d watch it burn?” Navani said, feeling exhausted—and snappish.\n“You’d actually let Urithiru fall rather than share what you know? If we\nlose the Oathgates permanently, that’s it for the war. That’s it for your\nhomeland.”\nAgain they remained silent.\n“Fine,” Navani said. “I hope when you die—knowing your homeland is\ndoomed, your families enslaved, your queen executed—you feel satisfied\nknowing that at least you maintained a slight market advantage.”\nNavani pushed to the front of the group, where her scholars were\ncoaxing Stormlight into the wall gem bit by bit. Often a fabrial needed to\nfill a certain percentage before it activated—but the more this one drew in\nStormlight, the slower the drain would occur.\nFootsteps scraped the stone behind her, and Navani turned to see Ulvlk\n—junior of the two Thaylen scholars—standing behind her. “We use\nsound,” she whispered. “If you can make the gemstone vibrate at a certain\nfrequency, it will draw in Stormlight regardless of the size of gems placed\nnext to it.”\n“Frequency…” Navani said. “How did you discover this?”\n“Traditions,” she whispered. “Passed down for centuries.”\n“Create a vibration…” Navani said. “You use drilled holes? No … that\nwould require Stormlight to be already infused. Tuning forks?”\n“Yes,” Ulvlk explained. “We touch the tuning fork against the full\ngemstone, making it vibrate, then can lead a line of Stormlight out to the\nempty one. After that, it will siphon, like liquid.”\n“Do you have the equipment here, now?” Navani asked.\n“I…”\n“Of course you do,” Navani said. “When I sent runners to fetch you, you\nthought I was going to evacuate you. You’d have grabbed anything of value\nin your rooms.”\nThe young Thaylen woman fished in her pocket, pulling out a metal\ntuning fork.\n“You will be expelled from the guild!” Vrandl snapped from behind,\nangerspren pooling beneath her. “This is a ploy!”\n“It’s no ploy,” Navani assured the nervous young woman. “Honestly, we\nwere close to a breakthrough using the weapons the Fused have—which are\nable to drain Stormlight out of a person. All you’ve done here is potentially\nsave this tower from invaders.”\nNavani tried the method, hitting the tuning fork, then touching one of the\ninfused gemstones.

Like how\nLight behaved when a Radiant was sucking it in.\nThat did the trick, infusing the wall gemstone in seconds. The Sibling\nhad explained what was coming, but Navani still jumped when—upon\nbeing infused—the fabrial made the entire wall shake.\nIt parted at the center; it had been a hidden door all along—locked by a\nfabrial that in the old days probably only a Radiant could have activated.\nThey quickly uncovered their lanterns and spheres, revealing a small\ncircular chamber with a pedestal in the center. Set into that was a large\nsapphire, uninfused.\n“Quickly,” Navani said to the others, “let’s get to work.”\n* * *\nKaladin slung his pack over his shoulder, then slipped out of the room of\nanother frightened family. This one, like those before, had asked him for\nnews, for information, for promises. Was it going to be all right? Would the\nother Radiants rise as he had? When would the Bondsmith return?\nHe wished he had answers. He felt so blind. He’d grown accustomed to\nbeing in the thick of everything important—privy to not only the plans of\nimportant people, but their worries and their fears as well.\nHe followed Syl, who darted into the hallway. The hour was late, and\nKaladin had to fight off a bout of grogginess, despite the shakes and thumps\nin the stone. Distant explosions from far below, so powerful they had to be\nthe acts of Regals or Fused. Somewhere in the tower, men fought. But up\nhere on the sixth floor, they cowered. The place dripped with the silence of\na thousand frightened people.\nHe reached an intersection, fighting off his fatigue. He was supposed to\nget back to the clinic and meet up with his father, but Syl was flitting\naround another way—she clearly wanted his attention. They had decided to\nkeep her distant from him in case a Voidspren noticed her.\nHe followed her down the left fork, through a doorway that led out onto\nthe large, patio-like balcony near his quarters. Though many of these\nbalconies were being used as community spots, this one was empty tonight\n—save for one figure standing near the edge. The carapace jutting out\nthrough holes in the uniform made Rlain distinctive, even in silhouette.\n“Hey,” Kaladin said, stepping up to him. Syl settled on the banister,\nglowing softly. Kaladin found it eerie to stare out in the darkness of night,\noverlooking an endless landscape of mountains and clouds—shimmering\ngreen from the final moon.\n“More troops,” Rlain said, nodding toward the plateau below—where\nanother formation of singers was moving toward the tower’s front gates.\n“They march like human armies, not like listener warpairs.”\n“I thought you were going to stay hidden in the clinic.”\n“This will be an occupation, Kal,” Rlain said, voice tinged by a mournful\nrhythm. “We won’t be recovering Urithiru tonight—or anytime soon. So\nwhere does that leave me?”\n“You’re not one of them.”\n“Am I one of you?”\n“You’ll always be a member of Bridge Four.”"

Assuming I could somehow stay out of sight,\nsomeone is going to reveal me to the Fused. Someone will think I’m a spy\nfor the enemy, and after that … well, it’s going to be very difficult to\nexplain why I didn’t walk out and embrace their occupation.”\nKaladin wanted to object. But storms, he was worried about a similar\nthing happening to him. One mention that he’d been a Radiant—that the\nsurgeon’s son was Kaladin Stormblessed, Windrunner—and … well, who\nknew what would happen?\n“So what do you do?” Syl asked from the railing.\n“Go to them,” Rlain said. “Pretend I’m not a listener, just an ordinary\nparshman who never managed to escape—and didn’t know what I should\ndo. It might work. Either that, or maybe I can hide among them, pretend\nI’ve always been with them. Merely another face in their forces.”\n“And if they take you out into the Everstorm?” Kaladin asked. “Demand\nyou take a Regal form—or worse, give yourself up to the soul of a Fused?”\n“Then I’ll have to find a way to escape, won’t I?” Rlain said. “This has\nbeen coming, Kal. I think I’ve always known I would have to face them. I\ncould make a home here if I wanted. I know that, and I’ll always be grateful\nto you and the others for making a place for me.\n“At the same time, I can’t ignore what was done to my people at the\nhands of human empires. I won’t be fully comfortable here. Not while I\nwonder if there are other listeners out there who survived the Everstorm.\nNot while I wonder if there’s more I could be doing to stop the disaster.”\nKaladin took a deep breath, though part of him was tearing inside.\n“Another farewell then.”\n“A temporary one, I hope,” Rlain said. Then, looking somewhat\nawkward, he held out his hands and gave Kaladin an embrace. Rlain had\nnever seemed fond of that human custom, but Kaladin was glad for the\ngesture.\n“Thank you,” Rlain said, pulling back. “For trusting me to make this\ndecision.”\n“That’s what you said you wanted, all those months ago,” Kaladin said.\n“When I promised I’d listen.”\n“To be trusted and acknowledged,” Rlain said.\n“I keep my oaths, Rlain. Especially to friends.”\n“I’m not going to join them, Kal. I am a spy. That is my training—as\nbest my kind could offer. I’ll find a way to help from the inside. Remember\nthat the first people Odium destroyed when he returned were not human, but\nlistener.”\n“Bridge Four,” Kaladin said.\n“Life before death,” Rlain returned.

When others tried to console him with\nlaughs, it often struck him as false, unnecessary. But from her … well, she\nhelped pull him out of the deep waters.\n“They’re all going to leave, aren’t they?” she whispered instead.\n“Moash, Rock, now Rlain … every one of them. They’re going to leave.\nOr … or worse…” She looked at Kaladin, uncharacteristically solemn.\n“They’ll all go away, and then there will be nothingness.”\n“Syl,” Kaladin said. “You shouldn’t say things like that.”\n“It’s true though,” she said. “Isn’t it?”\n“I won’t leave you.”\n“Like you almost did?” she said softly. “My old knight … he didn’t want\nto leave.… It’s not his fault. He was mortal though. Everyone dies. Except\nme.”\n“Syl?” Kaladin said. “What’s wrong? Is whatever they did to the tower\naffecting you?”\nShe was silent for a time, staring out over the green clouds. “Yes, of\ncourse,” she said. “I’m sorry. That’s not what you needed, is it? I can be\nperky. I can be happy.

Come on. We need to get back to the clinic.”\nShe zipped off, and—confused, worried, but most of all just exhausted—\nhe followed.\n* * *\nNavani watched as her people worked, infusing the gemstone at the center\nof the small chamber. They had borrowed a second tuning fork from the\nThaylen scholars, doubling their speed.\nSuch a simple tool. She and Rushu had theorized for hours about the\nprocess the Thaylen artifabrians were using—guessing everything from\nhidden Radiants to intricate machinery that mimicked water osmosis\nmethods, which followed similar scientific principles to Light infusion. In\nthe end, their actual method was far, far humbler.\nWasn’t that often how it turned out? Science seemed easy in retrospect.\nWhy hadn’t the ancients figured out you could intentionally trap a spren in a\ngemstone? Why hadn’t they discovered that a split gemstone would be\npaired? Add a little aluminum for the cage, and you could do incredible\nthings. With this knowledge, people four thousand years ago could have had\nflying ships as easily as Navani’s people.\nTrue, the hundreds of tiny leaps that led to advances were not as intuitive\nas they seemed. Regardless, it left Navani wondering. What wonders could\nshe create if she knew the next few leaps that would appear simple to her\ndescendants? What marvelous creations did she brush past each day, lying\nin pieces, waiting to be combined?\nMore thunder sounded; she hoped that the continued noise was a good\nsign for Teofil and his men.

Though the new\nThaylen method did indeed transfer Stormlight quickly, the strange fabrial\nseemed to be drinking far too much in. They’d emptied most of the spheres\nthey’d brought, and still the sapphire barely glowed. They seemed to be\ninjecting Light not just into the gemstone, but into the entire network of\ngemstones and crystal veins.\nWas it actually a fabrial? Navani didn’t recognize the cage, though it did\nhave metal wire running around it. And why did it have a glass globe, the\nsize of her fist, set off to the side in its own nook and attached to the\ngemstone by wires?\nAs her scholars worked, emptying one gemstone after the other, Navani\nbrushed the back of her freehand fingers against a vein of garnet in the wall.\nYou must move quickly, the Sibling said in her mind.\n“We are going as fast as we can,” Navani whispered. “Are my soldiers\nstill alive?”\nI cannot see them, the Sibling said. My vision is limited, in ways that are\nconfusing to me, as it was not always so. But I think the soldiers you sent\nare close. I can hear shouts nearby the crystal heart of the tower.\nNavani closed her eyes, hoping the Almighty would accept a whispered\nprayer, as she had no glyphward to burn.\nHurry, the Sibling said. Hurry.\nShe glanced toward the pile of gemstones. Fortunately, the Thaylen\nmethod could move Stormlight between different types of polestone. “We\nare trying. Do you know why spren prefer different kinds of gemstones?”\nBecause they are different, the Sibling said. Why do humans prefer one\nkind of food to another?\n“Yet foods dyed different colors—but with the same taste—are often\nequally acceptable to us.” Navani nodded to a small pile of emeralds.\n“Many gemstones are identical, at least by their structure. We think they\nmight even have the same basic chemical composition.”\nColor is like flavor to spren, the Sibling said. It is part of the soul of a\nthing.\nCurious.\nYou must move quickly, the Sibling repeated. The Lady of Pains has the\nSurge of Transformation and dangerous knowledge. She will infuse my\nentire heart—the pillar—in the proper order, using her Voidlight. In so\ndoing, she would corrupt me and leave me … leave me as one of the\nUnmade.…\n“And what we do here will defend you?” Navani whispered.\nYes. It will erect a barrier, preventing anyone—human, Unmade, or\nsinger—from reaching me.\n“That would stop Teofil too,” Navani said. “From breaking the\nconstruction that is blocking our Radiants.”\nTeofil is doomed, the Sibling said. You must hurry. Navani, they have\nactivated the Oathgate again. Fresh enemy troops have arrived.\n“How are they working it? They have Skybreakers, but they should be as\nlimited as our Radiants, right?”\nThey brought a human with one of the Honorblades.\nMoash. The murderer. Navani felt her anger rising. There was,\nunfortunately, little more she could do."

There was,\nunfortunately, little more she could do.\nQuickly. Please. Quickly … The Sibling seemed to hesitate. Wait.\nSomething has happened. The Lady of Pains has stopped.\n* * *\nVenli witnessed the last push of the human soldiers. She stood at the base of\nthe steps—which were of an odd sort. The stairwell up to the ground floor\nwas a large column of open space. Steps wound around the outside wall of\nthe cylinder. They looked so narrow and uncertain, hanging as they did with\na cavity of open space up the center.\nIt was pure madness to attempt to fight down such steep and uncertain\nfooting while harried by Fused and Regals. Yet the humans made a valiant\nrun of it. They locked shields and moved together with a precision that\nVenli’s sister had always admired. While listeners would fight as warpairs,\nin tune with one another and the rhythms of Roshar, humans seemed to\nhave their own kind of symbiosis—forged from hours upon hours spent\ntraining.\nA canopy of shields protected against Heavenly Ones, who hovered\nabout the formation, trying to stab with their lances—but indoors, they\ndidn’t have proper room to maneuver. Before beginning their assault, the\nhumans had poured barrels of water into the breach here—and it had rained\nupon the stormform Regals below. Their powers reacted poorly around\nwater, something Venli had always found somewhat ironic.\nThe descent was so dramatic that Venli sent for Raboniel, interrupting\nthe Fused’s work with the pillar. Raboniel marched out and looked up with\nshock at how close the humans were.\n“Quickly,” she snapped at the nearby stormforms. “Up those steps!\nEngage the soldiers directly!”\nThey obeyed, but with their powers dampened by the water, they were\nno match for the troops. The humans stabbed them dead or forced them off\nthe sides of the steps, pushing ever downward, rounding the circular wall,\ngrimly stepping over the bodies of their fallen comrades and maintaining a\nfront line that was three men wide.\n“Amazing,” Raboniel whispered. The humans fought like a great-shelled\nbeast—a winding, relentless chasmfiend, all armor and teeth.\nRaboniel waved for the rest of the Deepest Ones to join the fight—but\neven these proved ineffective. They had disrupted the formation a few times\nearly on, shoving their hands out of walls to push men, or reaching out from\nthe side to grab ankles. These soldiers, however, quickly adapted. The men\nclosest to the wall now marched with swords out, watching for Deepest\nOnes. More than one disembodied arm dropped to the ground near Venli,\njoining the fallen men and Regals who had lost their footing.\nStanding there beside an increasingly angry Raboniel, Venli thought the\nhumans might make it. Led by a grizzled older soldier—and reduced from\nhundreds to just fifty—they barreled stubbornly onward. Venli found herself\ncheering them silently, Timbre exulting to the Rhythm of Hope. She cared\nlittle for the humans as a whole, but it was impossible to watch such a\ndisplay of tenacity without being impressed."

She cared\nlittle for the humans as a whole, but it was impossible to watch such a\ndisplay of tenacity without being impressed.\nThis was why her people had dwindled, nearly vanished, during their\nyears at war with the humans. It wasn’t entirely the human access to Shards,\nor their incredible resources. It was the way they, individually weaker than\nany listener, worked together. They had no forms, but compensated with\ntraining, sacrificing individuality until they were practically spren—having\nbecome so good at a single thing, they could never change to another\npurpose.\nThey rounded the next loop, only twenty feet from the ground, while\nRaboniel began shouting for more Deepest Ones. Then a red line of light\nzipped down from above. The Pursuer had arrived.\nHe materialized in the very center of the formation of humans, swinging\nout with arms bearing sharpened carapace. The formation shattered as the\nmen frantically tried to reorient to this new foe—but of course the Pursuer\nzipped back into the air. He left behind a dummy, a fake carapace version of\nhimself. The humans began stabbing it repeatedly as the real Pursuer\nappeared with a crash among another segment of the line.\nAs quickly as that, the tide changed.\nThe Heavenly Ones found holes in the shield wall to begin stabbing\nindividual humans. The Deepest Ones used the confusion to grab sword\narms or trip soldiers. A small group of humans, led by the older veteran,\ntried to surge forward and dash the rest of the way—but the Regals near\nVenli had toweled dry, and they managed to unleash a collective bolt of\nlightning that destroyed the steps in a wide gap right in front of the men.\nThe human leader, and the men closest to him, dropped with the rubble\nto die. The rest began a frantic attempt at retreat. It ended quickly.\nRaboniel changed her rhythm to one of Relief, then strode back into the\nmural-lined corridor toward the pillar. Unwilling to watch the final\nslaughter, Venli turned and scurried alongside her. The sounds of bodies\nfalling—the din of armor against stone—chased them all the way.\n* * *\nIt is done, the Sibling whispered to Navani. Your men have fallen.\n“Are you certain?” Navani asked. “What do you see?”\nI used to be able to watch the entire tower. Now … I see just patches. A\nsmall portion of the sixth floor. A room on the fourth floor, with a cage in it.\nThe place nearest the Lady of Pains. She returns. She will kill me now.\nThe large gemstone her people had been working on—finally primed\nwith Stormlight—began glowing brightly. The light inside it started to shift\nand dance, furious. Then it drained away, vanishing.\nNavani felt a spike of alarm, until the Sibling spoke into her mind. It\nworked. Melishi … I have hated you … but now I bless you. It worked. I am\nsafe, for now.\nNavani let out a relieved breath.\nIf they reach the gemstone you just infused, the Sibling said, they could\ncorrupt me through it. You will need to destroy it.\n“Will that break the shield?” Navani forced out."

Your soldiers on the steps have fallen.\nShe breathed out, and would remember to burn a prayer for the fallen\nwhen she could. But if Teofil had been killed … then the tower was\ncaptured. Navani’s only course was to surrender. She would have to hope\nthat the barrier would last long enough either for Dalinar to reach them, or\nfor Navani to find a way to free the Radiants.\nAssuming she wasn’t killed. The Fused did not often slaughter\nindiscriminately, but there were reports of them executing high-ranking\nlighteyes. That depended on the Fused who led the individual forces, and\nhow much the people resisted.\n“Shatter that sapphire,” she said to her scholars. “Destroy the entire\nfabrial, cage included, and that glass globe.

We must find a way to deliver a formal surrender without\nbeing killed before we can make our intentions known.”\n* * *\nRaboniel approached the pillar again with some eagerness. Venli stood\nnearby as the Fused reached up to touch a specific set of gemstones that\nwere embedded in the construction, then began infusing those with\nVoidlight.\nAs soon as she’d begun, though, she hesitated. “Something curious is\nhappening here. There is Stormlight in the system. That shouldn’t be\npossible; the Sibling cannot create it.”\n“I thought that Stormlight was what the Radiants, and their fabrials,\nalways used,” Venli said.\n“The tower is something else.” She glanced at Venli, noting her\nconfusion—and unlike many Fused, she chose to explain. “The Sibling—\nthe tower, Urithiru—is the child of Honor and Cultivation, created to fight\nOdium. The place runs on the Sibling’s Light, a mixture of the essences of\nits parents. Stormlight alone shouldn’t be able to work the tower’s core\nsystems. Stormlight, to the Sibling, is incomplete. Like a key missing\nseveral of its teeth.”\n“And with Voidlight, you’re using a key … with no teeth?” Venli asked.\n“I’m not using a key at all. I’m breaking the lock.” Raboniel put her\nhands on the pillar, infusing another specific gemstone. “The Sibling is\ninsensate, completely unaware that we are here. That I can determine. I can\ncorrupt them, awaken them to serve us. Just as I expected. But also, there is\nStormlight. I feel it, a large amount. Perhaps … it’s simply the power\nthey’re using to work the pumps, or the lifts. Not true parts of the Sibling;\nsystems added later, attached to the construction. Those could take\nStormlight alone.…”\nRaboniel stopped and stepped back, humming to Craving—a rhythm to\nindicate confusion or a question.

It clicked like glass when touched. “This is incredible.”\n“Does it ruin our plans?” Venli asked.\n“Absolutely.”\n“And … you don’t mind?”\n“Of course not. This is going to be so interesting to crack open. I was\nright. The answers, the way to end the war, must be here.”\nA shimmer of red lightning moved across the ground up the hallway.\nVenli had seen this before—a spren like lightning running along a surface.\nIndeed, it materialized into the shape of a small human—not a singer, but a\nhuman, with odd eyes and hair that waved in an unseen wind.\nUlim. The first Voidspren she’d ever met, all those years ago. “Lady of\nWishes,” he said, performing a flowery bow. “We have located the\nBlackthorn’s wife, queen of this tower.”\n“Oh?” Raboniel asked. “Where was she hiding?”\n“A Deepest One—the Caller of Springs—found her near a strange fabrial\nthat is now unfortunately destroyed. The Caller summoned a force and\ncaptured Queen Blackthorn, who has come peacefully. She is now asking to\nspeak with whomever was leading our assault. Shall I have her killed?”\n“Don’t be wasteful, Ulim,” Raboniel said. “The Blackthorn’s wife will\nmake a very useful pawn. I would have thought better of you.”\n“Normally I would be nothing but eager for a new toy,” Ulim said. “But\nthis woman is dangerous and crafty. Reports say she’s the one who created\nthe flying machine that raided Alethkar last month.”\n“Then we certainly won’t kill her,” Raboniel said.\n“She could be seen as a symbol to the people of this tower…” Ulim said.\nThen the small spren cocked his head, looking at the shield covering the\ndoorway. “What’s that?”\n“You only just noticed it?” Venli asked.\nUlim glanced at her, then turned away, pretending to ignore her. What\ndid he think of Venli now, all these years later? He’d made such promises to\nher. Was he embarrassed that she’d lived, knowing what a liar he was?\n“It is a puzzle,” Raboniel said. “Come. I would meet this queen of the\ntower.”\n* * *\nNavani composed herself, standing with hands clasped before her,\nsurrounded by singer soldiers. Though the effects of fatigue made her want\nto droop, she kept her head high. She wished she had chosen a formal havah\ntoday, instead of this simple work dress with a gloved hand, but that\ncouldn’t be helped. A queen was a queen, regardless of what she wore. She"

She\nkept her expression calm, though she wasn’t certain whether she was\nawaiting imprisonment or death.\nThey had immediately separated her from the others, naturally, and had\ntaken her arm sheath with its fabrials. She wished she could burn a prayer to\nthe Almighty that her scholars would be kept safe. The only reason to\nsurrender was to protect them and the others of the tower. In this, the Fused\nhad been wise. They’d made it clear time and time again that they didn’t\nslaughter populations who surrendered. You always knew you had an out.\nAll you had to do was submit.\nIt was the same lesson that Gavilar and Navani herself had taught many,\nmany years ago. Cities that had joined the unified Alethkar had prospered.\nOf course, with Gavilar and Dalinar involved, there had always been an\nexplicit addition to that lesson. Fail to submit, and you would be sent the\nBlackthorn.\nWith those memories haunting her, it was difficult to evoke any sense of\noutrage as the enemy soldiers led her down the steps. How could Navani\nfeel outrage at having done to her what she’d willingly done to others? It\nwas the enormous flaw in Gavilar’s reasoning. If their strength justified\ntheir rule of Alethkar, then what happened when someone stronger came\nalong? It was a system that ensured there would always be war, a constant\nclash for rule.\nShe was able to use such high-minded philosophical thoughts to distract\nher up until she saw the first bodies. They lay slumped against the wall, in\nthe crook of the steps, men in Roion uniforms. Men with too-young faces,\nslaughtered as they’d tried to push for the crystal pillar.\nMen she’d sent to their deaths. Navani steeled herself, but had to walk\nthrough their blood to proceed. Vorin teachings abhorred gambling, and\nNavani had often been proud that she avoided such games of chance. Yet\nshe gambled with lives, didn’t she?\nThe blood was pervasive, dribbling down steps, threatening to make her\nslip. One of her captors placed a strong hand under her arm, as they\nmarched her around and around, passing breaks in the wooden railing\nwhere the fighting had grown intense.\nAt the bottom she found a pile of corpses, including some in Kholin\nuniforms. Poor Teofil and his men. It seemed they’d almost made it, judging\nby the fact that a Heavenly One had to fly Navani over a break in the steps\nwhere a few last corpses slumped—bespeaking their final moments.\nThank you, Teofil, she thought. And all of you. If the tower had a chance,\nit came because these men had bought her time. Even if they hadn’t reached\nthe pillar, they had done something remarkable. She would remember that\nsacrifice.\nAt the base of the steps, she was marched through the hallway with the\nmurals. As she walked, she found herself proud of how much of a fight\nthey’d put up. Not only Teofil and the soldiers, but the entire tower. Yes, it\nhad taken less than half a day for the Fused to conquer all of Urithiru, but"

Yes, it\nhad taken less than half a day for the Fused to conquer all of Urithiru, but\nconsidering Navani’s lack of Radiants and Shards, it was remarkable to\nhave lasted that long.\nShe felt particularly satisfied with their efforts when she saw the glowing\nblue light at the end of the hallway, blocking off the way to the pillar room.\nOdd, that she should feel most a queen in the moments before the position\nwas taken from her.\nThe soldiers steered her into the larger of the two library rooms, where a\ntall femalen Fused stood in light armor, looking over papers from one of the\nmany stacks in the room. Navani’s most precious engineering and design\nsecrets. The Fused had a strange hairstyle, with carapace covering nearly\nher entire head, save for a topknot-style bundle of thick orange singer hair.\nThe way the guards presented Navani made it clear that this was the leader.\nThe Fused continued to read, barely acknowledging Navani.\n“I am ready to discuss terms of surrender,” Navani finally said.\nA lithe Regal stepped to the femalen’s side. “Raboniel, Lady of Wishes,\nis not to be directly addressed by—”\nShe was interrupted by the Fused saying something. Whatever it was, the\nRegal didn’t seem to have expected it, for when she spoke again her voice\ncadence had changed markedly.\n“The Lady says, ‘She comes to me as a queen, though she will leave\nwithout the title. For now she may speak when she wishes, as befitting her\nrank.’”\n“Then let me offer surrender,” Navani said. “My soldiers have been\ninstructed to turn in their arms, should you approach with the proper sign\ngiven—proof that we’ve reached an accord.”\n“I will require your Radiants,” the Fused—Raboniel—said through her\ninterpreter. “You will release a proclamation: Anyone harboring a Radiant is\nsubject to harsh punishment. We will search the tower to bring all of them\nunder our care. Your soldiers and officers will be disarmed but spared.\n“Your people may continue living in the tower under our laws. All\nlighteyes—including you—will be made of equal status to darkeyes. You\nare humans, nothing more, nothing less. The will of a singer must be\nobeyed immediately, and humans may not carry weapons. Otherwise, I am\ncontent to let them continue their occupations—and even engage in trade, a\nprivilege not extended to most humans in Alethkar.”\n“I can’t give up the Knights Radiant to execution,” Navani said.\n“Then we will kill them all as they lie unconscious,” the Fused said.\n“And once finished, we will approach you with less lenient terms of\nsurrender. Conversely, we can make an accommodation now, and perhaps\nyour Radiants will live. I cannot promise I won’t change my mind, but I\ndon’t intend to execute them. We simply need to be certain they are\nproperly restrained.”\n“They’re unconscious. How much more restraint do they need?”\nRaboniel didn’t reply. She flipped through the pages.\n“I agree to these terms,” Navani said. “The tower is yours. If your people"

If your people\napproach my men with a white flag bearing a circle painted black, they will\nsurrender.”\nSeveral Regals went running with the news, and Navani wished them the\nwind’s own speed. “What have you done with my scholars? And the\nsoldiers down here in these rooms?”\n“Some are dead,” Raboniel said through the interpreter. “But not many.”\nNavani closed her eyes. Some? Which of her friends had been killed in\nthis incursion? Was she foolhardy, for resisting as long as she had?\nNo. Not if it bought us time to put the shield up. She knew very little\nabout the Sibling and this tower, but at least now she had a chance. Only by\nworking with the enemy, pretending to be docile and controlled, would she\nfind opportunity to restore the Radiants.\n“You drew these?” Raboniel asked through her interpreter, turning\naround the pages. They were indeed some of Navani’s sketches—more\nairships, of a more practical design, now that they better understood the\nmechanics of flight. They were signed by her seal.\n“Yes,” Navani said.\nThe Fused read through them further. Then, remarkably, she spoke in\nAlethi—heavily accented, but understandable. “Is it common for human\nqueens of this era to be engineers?”\nThis startled her attendant Regal, who seemed to not have known this\nLady of Wishes could speak Alethi. Or perhaps she was surprised to hear\none so high speak to a human.\n“I have unusual hobbies,” Navani said.\nRaboniel folded the sheet of paper and finally met Navani’s eyes. “They\nare remarkable. I would like to hire you.”\n“… Hire me?” Navani asked, taken aback.\n“You are no longer a queen, but you are obviously a talented engineer. I\nam told the scholars of this tower respect you. So, I would hire you to work\non fabrial projects for me. I assure you, being in my employ will be a far\nmore rewarding job than carrying water or washing clothing.”\nWhat game is this? Navani thought. Surely this Fused didn’t actually\nexpect Navani to design fabrials for the enemy?\n“Carrying water or washing clothing is fine work,” Navani said. “I’ve\ndone both before in my life. Neither will involve giving secrets to an enemy\nwho, I’m afraid, will inevitably use them to kill and conquer my people.”\n“True,” Raboniel said. “You are not prideful. I respect that. But consider\nmy offer before rejecting it. If you are close to me, you would have a much\neasier time tracking what I’m doing, spying on my projects. You will also\nhave greater opportunity to sneak information out to your husband, in hope\nof an eventual rescue. I know many things about Stormlight and Voidlight\nthat you do not. Pay attention, and I suspect you’d learn more from me than\nyou’d give up.”\nNavani felt her mouth go dry, searching the Fused’s red eyes, glowing\nfaintly from her corrupted soul. Storms.

This\ncreature was ancient, thousands of years old. What secrets must her mind\nhold.…\nCareful, Navani thought to herself. If she’s thousands of years old, she\nhas had thousands of years to practice manipulating people.\n“I will consider the offer,” Navani said.\n“Refer to me as ‘Ancient One’ or ‘Lady of Wishes,’” Raboniel said, “as\nyou no longer have the rank to ignore my title. I will put you with your\nscholars. Discuss it together, then inform me of your decision.”\nThe soldiers led Navani away. And just like that, she had lost another\nthrone.\nRegardless, please make yourself known to me when you travel my\nlands. It is distressing that you think you need to move in the shadows.\nBy the time they heard confirmation that the queen had surrendered,\nsunlight was beginning to stream through the windows of the clinic.\nKaladin and his family had spent the entire night seeing patients. Twenty\nhours, a full day, without sleep.\nEven the exhaustionspren near Kaladin seemed tired, swirling slowly,\nlethargic. The messenger woman sat down at their table in the clinic, bleary\neyed and wearing a disheveled uniform, as she accepted a cup of cold tea\nfrom Kaladin’s father.\n“The queen attempted a final push to restore the Radiants,” the woman\nsaid. “I don’t know what that entailed—only that the soldiers involved are\ndead now. I’ve been running messages to the neighborhoods on the sixth\nfloor. But yes, in answer to your question, I’ve seen Queen Navani and the\nhead of the Fused army together. She confirmed the surrender to me. We are\nto live under singer law, and not resist.”\n“Stormwinds,” Kaladin whispered. “I never realized how blind I’d feel\nwithout spanreeds.” It had taken hours for any sort of factual information to\nfilter up to the sixth floor.\n“So we’re supposed to go right back to living under their rule?”\nKaladin’s mother said from her seat at the table.\n“It wasn’t so bad,” Lirin said. “The highlords won’t like it, but it won’t\nmatter much for the rest of us.”\n“Fabrials don’t work,” Hesina said. “We can’t heat our rooms, not to\nmention our food. The water pumps will have halted. This tower won’t\nremain livable for long.”\n“The Fused use their powers,” Lirin replied. “Maybe if we infuse the\nfabrials with Voidlight, they’ll work.”\n“Pardon, Brightlord,” the scout said, “but that … feels wrong for many\nreasons.”\nKaladin had started rummaging in the cupboard for something to eat, so\nhe didn’t see his father’s reaction at being called “Brightlord.” He could\nguess though. It was an odd situation anyway, considering that Lirin’s eyes\nhadn’t changed, he’d simply been adopted into Kaladin’s house. Rank was\nbecoming a jumbled mess these days.\n“Kaladin, son,” Hesina said, “why don’t you go lie down?”"

Rank was\nbecoming a jumbled mess these days.\n“Kaladin, son,” Hesina said, “why don’t you go lie down?”\n“Why?” he said, getting out a stack of flatbread, then counting how\nmany pieces they had.\n“You’ve been prowling about like a caged animal,” she said.\n“No I haven’t.”\n“Son…” she said, in a calm—but infuriatingly wise—voice.\nHe set down the bread and felt at his brow, which was cold from sweat.\nHe took a deep breath, then turned around to face them, his father leaning\nagainst the wall, his mother at the table with the messenger woman. She had\nwhite and grey hair, but was young enough that it seemed premature, and\nhad a pair of white gloves tucked into her belt. An Alethi master-servant\ndoing double duty as a messenger.\n“You’re all taking this too calmly,” Kaladin said, tossing up his hands.\n“Don’t you realize what this means? They control the tower. They control\nthe Oathgates. That is it. The war is over.”\n“Brightlord Dalinar still has the bulk of the Radiants with him,” Alili, the\nmessenger, said. “And our armies were mostly deployed around the world.”\n“And now they’re all isolated!” Kaladin said. “We can’t fight a war on\nmultiple fronts without the Oathgates. And what if the enemy can repeat\nwhatever they did here? What if they start making Radiant powers go away\non every battlefield?”\nThat quieted her. Kaladin tried to imagine what the war would be like\nwithout Windrunners or Edgedancers. Already, the battlefields were starting\nto look very little like the ones he’d known during his days as a spearman.\nFewer large-scale formations maneuvering against other blocks of men.\nThose were too easy to disrupt from above, or by other types of Fused.\nMen spent their days in protected camps, making only sudden surges to\nclaim ground and shove away the enemy. Battles stretched on for months,\ninstead of occurring in decisive engagements. Nobody quite knew how to\nfight a war like this—well, nobody on their side, at least.\n“I keep waiting,” Kaladin said, wiping his brow again, “for the thunder\nto hit. The lightning struck last night. We saw the flash, and need to brace\nourselves for the shock wave.…”\n“Brightlord,” Alili said, “pardon, but … maybe you could help the other\nRadiants? To do whatever you did?”\n“What did I do?”\n“That’s what I’m asking,” she said. “Again, pardon, but Brightlord\nStormblessed … you’re the sole Radiant I’ve seen in the tower who is still\nstanding. Whatever the enemy did, it knocked out all the others. Every\nsingle one. Except you.”\nHe thought of Teft, lying on the slab in the other room. They’d spooned\nbroth into his mouth, and he had taken it, stirring and muttering softly\nbetween mouthfuls.\nThe long night weighed on Kaladin. He did need rest.

Before all this had happened, he’d gotten them\nrooms on the fourth floor, among the men who had lost arms or legs in the\nwar, and who now did work maintaining gear for other soldiers.\nKaladin’s patients had been making real progress. He could imagine\nexactly how they felt now though, living through another horror as the\nbattle—so frequently a source of nightmares to them—found them again.\nThey must be beside themselves.\nNot just them, Kaladin thought, wiping his brow again with his hand.\nThe messenger woman rose and stretched, then bowed and moved on her\nway to continue delivering the news. Before she reached the front door,\nhowever, Syl zipped in from underneath it, twirled around in a few circles,\nthen zipped back out.\n“Enemy soldier,” Kaladin said under his breath to his parents, “coming\nthis way.”\nIndeed, as the messenger left, a singer wearing a sleek Regal form\npeeked in to check on Kaladin and his parents. The singer lingered only a\nshort time before turning away. There weren’t enough of them yet to guard\neach and every home. Kaladin suspected that as more and more singers\nmoved into the tower, he and his family wouldn’t be able to speak as openly\nas they’d been doing so far this morning.\n“We should get some sleep,” Lirin said to Kaladin.\n“The other townspeople—” Kaladin began.\n“Laral and I will visit them,” Hesina said, rising. “I got some sleep\nearlier.”\n“But—”\n“Son,” Lirin said. “If the Radiants are in comas, that means no\nEdgedancers—and no Regrowth. You and I need sleep, because we’re going\nto become very busy men over the next few days. There’s an entire tower\nfull of frightened people, and likely as not a few hotheaded soldiers will\ntake it upon themselves to make trouble despite the queen’s orders. They’re\nall going to need two rested surgeons.”\nHesina gave her husband a fond touch on the cheek with her safehand,\nthen a kiss. She pulled a handkerchief from her pocket and gave it to\nKaladin as he found himself yet again wiping his brow. Then she left to go\nvisit Laral—who had seen the messenger before them and already knew the\nsituation.\nKaladin reluctantly joined his father and walked down the long hallway\npast the patient rooms toward the family’s living quarters.\n“What if I’m one of those hotheads?” Kaladin asked. “What if I can’t\nlive with this?”\nLirin stopped in the hallway. “I thought we’d discussed this already,\nson.”\n“You think I can ignore the fact that the enemy has conquered my\nhome?” Kaladin said. “You think you can just turn me into a good, well-\nbehaved slave like—”\n“Like me?” Lirin asked with a sigh. His eyes flicked up, likely noting the\nbrands on Kaladin’s forehead, mostly covered by his hair. “What would\nhave happened, son, if instead of trying so hard to escape all those years,\nyou’d instead proven yourself to your masters?

How good it felt to\nbe helping for once.”\n“There is more than one way to help.”\n“And your nightmares?” Lirin asked. “The cold sweats? The times where\nyour mind numbs? Was that caused by my kind of help, or your kind? Son,\nour mandate is to find those who are hurt, then see them cared for. We can\ndo that even if the enemy has conquered us.”\nIn a way, Kaladin could understand what his father said. “Your words\nmake sense up here,” Kaladin said, tapping his head. “But not down here.”\nHe slapped his breast.\n“That’s always been your problem, son. Letting your heart override your\nhead.”\n“My head can’t be trusted sometimes,” Kaladin said. “Can you blame\nme? Besides, isn’t the entire reason we became surgeons because of the\nheart? Because we care?”\n“We need both heart and mind,” Lirin said. “The heart might provide the\npurpose, but the head provides the method, the path. Passion is nothing\nwithout a plan. Wanting something doesn’t make it happen.\n“I can acknowledge—have to acknowledge—that you accomplished\ngreat things serving Dalinar Kholin. But with the Radiants down and most\nof the king’s surgeons on the battlefield, we are what stands between the\npeople of this tower and deathspren. You acknowledge that you don’t think\nright sometimes? Then trust me. Trust my thoughts.”\nKaladin grimaced, but nodded. It was true that his thoughts had proven\n—time after time—that they couldn’t be trusted. Besides, what did he think\nhe was going to do? Fight a war against the invaders all by himself? After\nNavani had surrendered?\nBefore retiring, they checked on the unconscious people in the patient\nrooms. The Stoneward was completely out cold, less responsive than Teft,\nthough Lirin was able to get her to take soup by spooning it to her lips.\nKaladin studied her—checking her eyes, her heart rate, her temperature.\nThen he moved over to Teft. The bearded Windrunner shifted, his eyes\nclosed, and when Kaladin put broth to his lips he took it far more eagerly.\nHis hands twitched, and though Kaladin couldn’t make out anything he was\nsaying, he kept muttering under his breath.\nHe’s a Windrunner, of the same oath as me, Kaladin thought. I’m awake\nwhen the others fell. Teft is close to being awake. Was there a connection?"

There had been around two dozen other Windrunners in the tower.\nHis status as a surgeon should let him visit them and check their vitals.\nStorms. His father was correct. Kaladin could accomplish far more by\nbacking down than he could by fighting.\nSyl came zipping into the room a short time later. Lirin noticed her too,\nso she’d made herself visible to him.\n“Syl,” Kaladin said, “will you check again to see if you can spot Teft’s\nspren? He seems like he’s coming closer to waking, so she might be\nbecoming more visible.”\n“No time,” Syl said, turning into the shape of a young woman with a\nsword strapped to her waist, wearing a scout’s uniform. She halted in the\nair, standing as if on an invisible platform. “They’re coming.”\n“Another Regal coming to check in on us?” Kaladin said.\n“Worse,” Syl said. “A group of soldiers, led by a different Regal, is\nsearching each residence, methodically heading this direction. They’re\nhunting for something.”\n“Or someone,” Kaladin said. “They’ve heard that Stormblessed is\nawake.”\n“Don’t jump to conclusions, son,” Lirin said. “If they were searching for\nyou specifically, they’d have come straight here. I’ll go see what this is\nabout. If they are looking for you, escape out the window and we’ll decide\nwhat to do later.”\nKaladin withdrew into the family room, which had doors to their\nbedrooms—including the small closet where little Oroden was sleeping in\nhis crib. Kaladin didn’t go to his bedroom though. He cracked the door into\nthe hallway, and was able to hear voices when his father opened the door at\nthe far front of the clinic. Unfortunately, he couldn’t hear what they were\nsaying. He nodded to Syl, who risked zipping out to get closer and\noverhear.\nBefore she could return, the voices drew nearer. Kaladin made out the\nRegal by the rhythm of his speech.\n“… don’t care if you’re a surgeon, darkeyes,” the soldier said. “I have\nthe queen’s sealed writ here, and its instructions supersede what you might\nhave been told by messengers. All Radiants are to be taken into custody.”\n“These are my patients,” Lirin said. “They were entrusted to my care.\nPlease; they’re no danger to you like this.”\n“Your queen accepted these terms,” the Regal replied. “Complain to\nher.”\nKaladin peeked out the door into the hallway. A Regal led five ordinary\nwarform singers. Their larger figures appeared cramped in the stone\ncorridor as they walked to the two patient rooms. So they weren’t after him,\nnot specifically. They were searching for fallen Radiants.\nIndeed, the Regal gestured his attendants toward the first exam room.\nTwo moved out soon after, carrying the fallen Stoneward between them."

Only that the surgeon has a\ncouple of fallen Radiants.”\nKaladin nodded, though he’d grown tense.\n“I can care for these far better than you can,” Lirin said. “Removing\nthem like this could be dangerous to their health, even deadly.”\n“Why would we care?” the Regal said, both tone and rhythm sounding\namused. Two of his soldiers took the Stoneward’s squires, one each, and\nhauled them out of the second exam room. “I think we should throw them\nall off the tower and rid ourselves of a huge problem.

The Fused wouldn’t go to the effort of\ntaking the Radiants captive only to kill them. Would they?\nDid it matter?\nThey were going to take Teft.\nThe Regal moved into the first exam room, and Kaladin’s father\nfollowed, making more objections. Kaladin stood with one hand on the\nwall, one hand on the door, breathing deeply. Wind surged through the\nwindow behind, brushing past him, bearing with it two twisting windspren\nthat moved as lines of light.\nA hundred objections held him. His father’s arguments. His soul in\nfragments. The knowledge that he was probably too tired to be making\ndecisions. The fact that the queen had decided it was best to end hostilities.\nSo many reasons to stay where he was. But one reason to move.\nThey were going to take Teft.\nKaladin pulled open the door and stepped into the hallway, feeling the\ninevitable shift of a boulder perched on the top of a slope. Just. Beginning.\nTo tip.\n“Kaladin…” Syl said, landing on his shoulder.\n“It was a nice dream, wasn’t it, Syl?” he asked. “That we could escape?\nFind peace at long last?”\n“Such a wonderful dream,” she whispered.\n“You ready for this?” he asked.\nShe nodded, and he stepped into the doorway of the exam room. Two\nenemy soldiers remained in the room: one warform and the stormform\nRegal. The Regal had helped get Teft up onto the regular soldier’s\nshoulders.\nLirin looked straight at Kaladin, then shook his head urgently, his eyes\ngoing wide.\n“You will put him down,” Kaladin said to the singers. “And leave\nquietly. Send one of the Fused to get him, if they’re so insistent.”\nThe two froze, and the Regal sized him up. “Go back to bed, boy,” he\neventually said. “You don’t want to try my patience today.”\nLirin dashed forward, trying to push Kaladin out of the room. With a\nquick pivot to the side, Kaladin sent his father tumbling into the hall—and\nhopefully out of danger. He stepped back into the doorway."

He stepped back into the doorway.\n“Why not go for reinforcements?” Kaladin said to the two singers.\nAlmost more a plea than a request. “Don’t press this issue right now.”\nThe Regal gestured for his companion to set Teft back onto the exam\ntable, and for a moment Kaladin thought they might actually do what he\nsaid. Then the Regal unhooked the axe from its sheath at his side.\n“No!” Lirin said from behind. “Don’t do this!”\nIn response, Kaladin drew in a breath of Stormlight. His body came\nalight with the inner storm, and wisps of luminescent smoke began to curl\nfrom his skin.\nThat gave the two singers pause, until the warform pointed. “That’s him,\nBrightlord! The one the Pursuer is searching for! He matches the\ndescription exactly!”\nThe Regal grinned. “You’re going to make me very rich, human.” Dark\nred lightning crackled across his skin. The warform shied away, hitting the\ncounter and causing surgery implements to clink against one another.\nLirin grabbed Kaladin from behind.\nKaladin stood quietly on that precipice. Balanced.\nThe Regal leaped forward, swinging his axe.\nAnd Kaladin stepped off the edge.\nHe shook free of his father’s grip and shoved him backward with one\nhand, then caught the Regal’s arm with his other before the axe could fall.\nKaladin braced himself for the jolt of energy that shot through him at\ntouching a stormform—he’d fought these before. It stunned him for a\nmoment nonetheless, so he wasn’t ready to guard as the Regal cuffed him\nacross the face, ripping his cheek with the barbed carapace on the back of\nhis hand.\nStormlight would heal that. Kaladin got his other hand up, preventing\nanother punch while continuing to hold back the axe. The two struggled for\na moment, then Kaladin managed to get the advantage, tipping their center\nof balance forward so he could twist and ram his shoulder into the Regal.\nStorms it hurt. That carapace was no joke. Still, the maneuver put his\nopponent momentarily off balance, so Kaladin was able to control the fight,\nspinning his enemy around and slamming the creature’s hand into the\ncorner of an exam table. A resounding snap split the air, and the carapace on\nthe hand cracked.\nThe Regal hissed in pain and dropped the axe. But then he pivoted hard\nand rammed his side into Kaladin’s chest, shoving him against the counter.\nKaladin’s father was shouting, but the warform—instead of helping—\nremained by the opposite wall. He didn’t seem eager to attack a Radiant.\nWithout Stormlight, Kaladin wouldn’t have been able to withstand the\nconstant jolts of energy from the stormform’s touch. As it was, he was able\nto hold on—not letting the enemy force him back too much—until the\nRegal tried another punch. At the windup, Kaladin hooked his leg around\nthe foot of his opponent, then sent them both to the ground."

At the windup, Kaladin hooked his leg around\nthe foot of his opponent, then sent them both to the ground.\nHe landed with a grunt and tried to roll into position to choke his\nopponent unconscious. If the fight ended without bloodshed, perhaps his\nfather would forgive him.\nUnfortunately, Kaladin hadn’t done a lot of wrestling. He knew enough\nto keep himself from being pinned easily, but the Regal was stronger than\nhe was, and that carapace kept jabbing in surprising places and interfering\nwith his holds. The Regal leveraged his superior weight and strength,\ntwisting Kaladin around with a grunt. Then—with Kaladin pinned beneath\nhim—the creature began pummeling him in the face with his good fist, the\none that hadn’t cracked.\nKaladin breathed in a gasp of Stormlight, draining the spheres on the\ncounter. He brought his fist up and slammed it into the back of the hand that\nhad cracked earlier. His enemy flinched, and Kaladin was able to kick free,\nthrowing the Regal off—though both slammed into the counters in the tight\nconfines as he did so.\nKaladin scrambled to find his feet so he could attack his enemy from\nabove—but the Regal began to glow red. The hairs on Kaladin’s arms stood\nup, and he had a fraction of a second to duck to the side as a flash of light—\nand an earsplitting crack—filled the room.\nHe hit the ground, blinded and deafened, the sharp scent of a lightning\nstrike filling his nostrils. Strange and distinctive, it was a scent he\nassociated with rainfall. Kaladin didn’t think he’d been struck directly—\nstormforms had trouble aiming their lightning—but it took a moment for\nKaladin’s Stormlight to heal his ears and restore his vision.\nA shadow moved over him, swinging its axe down. Kaladin twisted to\nthe side just in time. The axe clanged against the ground.\nI’m sorry, Father, Kaladin thought, reaching for the scalpel in his boot.\nAs the axe fell again, Kaladin let it bite him in the left shoulder, praying his\nStormlight would hold. He rammed the scalpel into the side of the Regal’s\nknee, directly between bits of carapace.\nThe Regal screamed and stumbled. Kaladin’s shoulder hurt like\nDamnation, but he pushed through the pain and leaped to his feet. His\nStormlight ran out as he rushed his enemy, toppling them again—but this\ntime Kaladin fell with more care and dropped on top of the Regal. With the\nmomentum of the fall, he rammed his scalpel into the creature’s neck, right\nabove its carapace gorget.\nThe knife wasn’t intended for battle, but it was sharpened to exactness.\nKaladin twisted it and swiftly cut the carotid artery, then threw himself up.\nHe stumbled back against the counter, covered in sweat, panting, his\nhearing not fully healed from the blast. The Regal thrashed on the floor, and\norange blood … Well, Kaladin turned away. Some sights were sickening\neven for a surgeon.\nEven for a soldier, he corrected. You’re no surgeon.\nHe looked across the room at the singer who huddled beside the far wall."

You’re no surgeon.\nHe looked across the room at the singer who huddled beside the far wall.\nHe’d watched, stunned, and hadn’t intervened.\n“Haven’t been in many fights, have you?” Kaladin asked, hoarse.\nThe singer jumped, his eyes wide. He was in warform, so he appeared\nfearsome, but his expression told another story. That of a person who\nwanted to be anywhere else, a person horrified by the brutality of the fight.\nStorms … He hadn’t considered that singers might feel battle shock too.\n“Go,” Kaladin said, then winced as the dying Regal’s leg thumped\nagainst the wall with a frantic, panicked sound. Bleeding out always seemed\nto happen too quickly to your friends, and not quickly enough to those you\nkilled.\nThe singer stared at him, haunted, and Kaladin realized the malen might\nalso have been deafened by the lightning. Kaladin pointed, mouthing the\nword. “Go!”\nThe singer scrambled away, leaving wet orange footprints from the\ndying singer’s blood. Kaladin pulled himself over to the opposite counter,\nwhere a few spheres still glowed. He drew those in and healed the rest of\nhis wounds. He should have kept another pouch on him. This had been\ncoming.\nHe searched out the doorway, and found his father on the floor where\nKaladin had shoved him, lit by morning light coming in through the distant\nwindow.\n“You all right?” Kaladin asked him. “Did that blast hurt you?”\nLirin stood up, staring past Kaladin. Into the room, square at the dying\nRegal. In the other room, Oroden had started crying. Then Lirin,\novercoming his shock, scrambled into the room to try to help the dying\nsinger.\nFather is fine, Kaladin thought. The thunder of stormform lightning\nblasts—at least those made by a single individual—wasn’t as bad as that of\nreal lightning. As long as you were sheltered, as his father had been, you\nwouldn’t suffer permanent hearing loss.\nKaladin tiredly glanced to Syl, who sat on the counter with her hands in\nher lap. Her eyes were closed, her head turned away from the dying Regal\nas Lirin tried to stanch the blood flow. Kaladin had killed dozens, perhaps\nhundreds of them during this war—though he’d tried to focus his attention\non the Fused. He’d told himself that those fights were more meaningful, but\nthe truth was that he hated killing common soldiers. They never seemed to\nhave much of a chance against him.\nYet each Fused he killed meant something even worse. A noncombatant\nwould be sacrificed to give that Fused new life, so each one of them Kaladin\nkilled meant taking the life of some housewife or craftsman.\nHe moved over to Teft, Kaladin’s glowing body illuminating the man,\nunconscious on the table. Kaladin spared a momentary worry for the\nStoneward who had been taken. Could he somehow rescue her too?\nDon’t be a fool, Kaladin. You barely saved Teft. In fact, you might not\nhave saved him yet.

It had stopped moving, finally.\n“We’ll need to hide,” Kaladin said to his father. “I’ll fetch Mother.” He\nsurveyed his bloody clothing. “Perhaps you should do that, actually.”\n“How dare you!” Lirin whispered, his voice hoarse.\nKaladin hesitated, shocked.\n“How dare you kill in this place!” Lirin shouted, turning on Kaladin,\nangerspren pooling at his feet. “My sanctuary. The place where we heal!\nWhat is wrong with you?”\n“They were going to take Teft,” Kaladin said. “Kill him.”\n“You don’t know that!” Lirin said. He stared at his bloodied hands.\n“You … You just…” He took a deep breath. “The Fused are probably\ngathering the Radiants to keep them in one location, and watch to see that\nnone of them wake up!”\n“You don’t know that,” Kaladin said. “I wasn’t going to let them take\nhim. He’s my friend.”\n“Is that it, or did you just want an excuse?” Lirin’s hands trembled as he\ntried to wipe the blood onto his trousers. When he looked back at Kaladin,\nsomething seemed to have broken in him, tears on his cheeks. Storms, he\nseemed exhausted.\n“Heralds above…” Lirin whispered. “They really did kill my boy, didn’t\nthey? What have they done to you?”\nKaladin’s smidgen of Stormlight ran out. Damnation, he was so tired.\n“I’ve tried to tell you. Your boy died years ago.”\nLirin stared at the floor, wet with blood. “Go. They’ll come for you\nnow.”\n“You need to go into hiding with me,” Kaladin said. “They’ll know\nyou’re my—”\n“We’re not going anywhere with you,” Lirin snapped.\n“Don’t play the sixth fool, Father,” Kaladin said. “You can’t let them\ntake you after this.”\n“I can and will!” Lirin shouted, standing up. “Because I will take\nresponsibility for what I’ve done! I will work within whatever confines I\nmust in order to protect people! I have taken oaths not to harm!” He\ngrimaced, sickened. “Oh, Almighty. You murdered a man inside my home.”\n“It wasn’t murder,” Kaladin said.\nLirin didn’t respond.\n“It wasn’t murder.”\nLirin sank to the floor. “Just … go,” he said, his voice growing soft\nagain. The grief in it, the disappointment, was far worse than the anger had\nbeen. “I will … find a way to get the rest of us out of this. That singer saw\nme trying to make you stop. They won’t harm a surgeon who didn’t fight.\nBut you, they’ll kill.”\nKaladin hesitated. Could he really leave them here?\n“Storms…” Lirin whispered. “Storms, my son has become a monster.…”\nKaladin steeled himself, then slipped into the back room and recovered\nan extra pouch of spheres he kept there.

Then he returned to the exam room,\ntrying—and failing—to avoid the blood. He lifted Teft with a grunt, putting\nhim in a medic’s carry across his back.\n“I’ve taken oaths too, Father,” he said. “I’m sorry I’m not the man you\nwanted me to be. But if I were a monster, I would never have let that other\nsoldier go.”\nHe left, running for the uninhabited center of the sixth floor as shouts in\nthe singer tongue began to sound behind him.\nTHE END OF\nPart Two\nVyre was unchained.\nMoash, the man he’d once been, had lived his entire life chained up and\nnever known it. Oh, he’d recognized the bonds the lighteyes used on him.\nHe’d experienced their tyranny both directly and indirectly—most painfully\nin the deaths of those he loved, left locked away in their dungeons.\nBut he hadn’t recognized the truer chains. The ones that bound his soul,\nconstraining him to mere mortality, when he could always have been so\nmuch more.\nVyre threw his Shardblade with a wide, overhand throw. Sunlight flashed\nalong the spinning blade as it soared across the quarry and then clanged\nagainst a large rock before bouncing free, tearing a gash in the ground, then\nfinally coming to a rest wedged in the stone.\n“I … still don’t understand what you’re doing, Vyre,” Khen said to\nConfusion. Warform suited her. It always had. “That weapon was not meant\nto be thrown.”\nThey worked together in the quarry—which had been created by mining\nthrough the crem many feet down to reach marble—outside of Kholinar. As\nusual, his small band of singers went where he did, and started working—\nquietly—as he did. Moments earlier, Vyre had been cutting stones out with\nthis Blade.\nNow, his attention had turned inward. Toward chains, and bindings, and\nprisons unseen. He gestured, and the distant Shardblade vanished to mist.\nYet it took him ten heartbeats to summon it again.\n“I saw Prince Adolin throw his Blade,” Vyre said. “Three months ago, on\nthe battlefield in northern Jah Keved. He is no Radiant, yet his Blade\nresponds to him as if he were one.…”\n“Maybe it was just a lucky throw.”\nVyre threw his Blade again. It clanged uselessly off his target. He\nnarrowed his eyes, then dismissed it into a puff of mist.\n“No,” Vyre said. “He must be able to change the balance to allow for this\nmaneuver. And it returned to him faster than ten heartbeats, even accounting\nfor the accelerated pulse of battle.”\nVyre waited until the weapon appeared in his grip. This was an ancient\nweapon, one of the mighty Honorblades. Yet it was inferior. It couldn’t\nchange shape, and cost far more Stormlight to use, often crusting his\nclothing with frost when he used it too quickly.\nHe didn’t feel anger at his Blade’s inferiority. Or humiliation. The lack\nof those emotions let him consider the situation clearly, fueling his\ncuriosity, his determination. This was what it was like to be unchained. To\nbe freed from captivity."

To\nbe freed from captivity.\nTo never again feel guilt.\nHe strode through the quarry. A thousand clinks of metal on stone\nsurrounded him, like the dancing feet of cremlings. An overcast sky and a\ncalm wind chilled his skin as he picked a new section of the quarry in which\nto work. He began slicing at the wall to cut free another large block of the\nprecious marble.\n“Vyre,” Khen said. To Determination. Curious. What did she want that\nmade her so afraid? “I … I am leaving.”\n“Very well,” Vyre said, working.\n“You’re … not angry?”\n“I can’t be angry,” he said, truthfully. “Nor can I feel disappointment.”\nAfter all these months together, she still didn’t understand—because she\nrushed to explain, worried he’d be upset, despite what he’d said. “I don’t\nwant to go on these raids and fight anymore, Vyre. I feel like I woke up to\nlife, and then immediately started killing. I want to see what it is like to\nlive. Really live. With my own mind, my own Passions.”\n“Very well,” Vyre said.\nShe hummed to Reconciliation.\n“You are chained, Khen,” Vyre explained. “You haven’t given your\nnegative emotions to him. Your insecurities. Your fears. Your pain. I was\nlike you for many years.” He narrowed his eyes, turning and looking to the\nwest. Toward him. “Then I took the chains off and saw what I could truly\nbecome.”\nShe hummed to … was that Curiosity? Yes, he thought it was.\n“What?” Vyre asked.\n“You say you’re unburdened, Vyre,” she said. “That you don’t care\nanymore. But you keep hunting him. The Windrunner.”\nAt the mention of Kaladin, Moash felt a hint of old, painful emotions—\nthough Odium quickly sucked them away. “Kaladin is a friend,” Moash\nsaid. “It is important to me that he find his freedom. Go your way, Khen. If\nyou become unchained in the future, seek me out. You are a capable\nwarrior, and I would fight beside you again.”\nVyre heaved a rock onto his right shoulder and began hauling it out of\nthe quarry. The others remained in place, working.\nVyre enjoyed hauling rocks. Simple work was best to pass the time. It\nreminded him of days spent walking with caravans. Except this was better,\nbecause it tired out his body, but left him capable of thinking on his curious\nstate. His new state.\nLarge stone settled on his shoulder, he hiked steadily up the path toward\nKholinar. The marble was heavy, but not so much that he needed Stormlight\nor supernatural help. That would defeat the purpose. For a time, he walked,\nhappy with his status. And he thought about Kaladin.\nPoor Kaladin. There was freedom available for his old friend. Two\nfreedoms, in fact. But he doubted Kaladin would ever accept the same\nfreedom as Vyre, so he offered the other one. The sweet peace of\nnonexistence."

The sweet peace of\nnonexistence.\nKhen was correct in questioning Vyre. So many things that had once\nbeen important didn’t bother him any longer, so why did Kaladin tease at\nhim, draw his attention? Why did Kaladin always make the old emotions\nchurn again, if briefly?\nThere was one chain still holding to him, Vyre admitted. That of his\nfriend. I have to be right, Vyre thought. And he has to be wrong. Kaladin\nhad to acknowledge that Vyre was right. Until he did …\nUntil he did, that last chain would remain.\nVyre eventually reached Kholinar and passed through the gates. The city\nhad well and truly settled into its new existence. The peoples intermixed,\nthough singers were properly given deference. They were models of\nbehavior the humans needed to learn to follow. When disputes happened,\nthe singers forced men to be fair to one another. After all, when the parents\ncame home, it was their duty to remove privileges if they found a mess.\nHumankind had been given millennia to prove they could self-govern\nproperly, and they had failed.\nPeople stared at him. He wasn’t wearing his uniform, and he’d covered\nhis Bridge Four shoulder tattoo with elbow-length sleeves. He was not\ndistinctive. Yet he was. For they knew him; they whispered of him. Vyre.\nHe Who Quiets.\nHe who hauls rocks.\nVyre soon reached a building site near the District of Colors. Here,\nworkers were constructing special housing for some of the Deepest Ones.\nEach brand of Fused had its particularities. These liked to have homes\nwithout floors, so they could touch the natural stone ground with their\nunshod feet. They could move through other materials too, so long as they\nwere solid, but they liked the feeling of uncut stone underfoot, stretching to\nthe heart of Roshar. So Vyre’s marble would be used for the walls.\nVyre hadn’t been asked to help with this job. If negative emotions could\nrule him, he suspected he’d have been annoyed at their neglect. Hard labor\nin the city? Not telling him was like hiding sweets from a child. Fortunately,\nhe’d found out about it a few days ago, and had started cutting his own\nrocks and hauling them.\nVyre set his block of marble down by the masons’ station, where they\nwere honing them. Then he helped unload a cart that had pulled in from the\nother quarry, full to the brim.\nOne stone at a time. Heave, haul, drop. It was excellent work. Difficult,\ngrueling. He was so lost in the effort that when the chull carts were all\nempty, he dusted his hands off—and was surprised to find himself virtually\nalone. When had the masons and other workers left? It wasn’t yet midday.\n“Where is everyone?” he asked the chull keeper, who was quickly\ngathering his beasts to take them to their pen.\n“Everstorm tonight, Brightlord. We were given a half day off, in\ncelebration.”\n“I’m not a brightlord,” Vyre said, checking the sky—though, as he now\nrecalled, the storm wouldn’t arrive for many more hours. But it was likely"

But it was likely\napproaching Urithiru right now. The armies were preparing to attack. Well,\nhe’d been told to stay back from that fight, so he looked at the chull keeper.\n“How much more stone do you need?”\n“Well, um, Bright … er, Lord Silencer? Sir? Um. Yes, we need about\ndouble what we have now. There’s a pile at the second quarry, but we have\nchulls and carts to—”\n“We shouldn’t let the chulls have all the fun,” Vyre said, turning and\nwalking along the road toward the city gates.\nBefore Vyre reached the gates, however, he was taken into a vision. He\nmaterialized on a vast field of golden light. Odium was there, a hundred feet\ntall, seated on a throne. In the guise of a mighty Fused, majestic like a king\nshould be.\nVyre walked closer and knelt. “You can take me without a storm now,\nLord?”\nOUR CONNECTION GROWS STRONGER, Odium said. I HAVEN’T NEEDED A\nSTORM TO BRING YOU INTO A VISION FOR MONTHS NOW, VYRE. I USUALLY DO IT\nFOR TRADITION’S SAKE.\nThat made sense. Vyre waited for further instructions.\nI’VE NOTICED YOU WALKING FREELY ABOUT IN STORMS ON PREVIOUS DAYS,\nVYRE, Odium said, his voice like thunder. YOU HAVE GIVEN ME YOUR WORST\nEMOTIONS, BUT YOU SHOULD MAINTAIN A SENSE OF SELF-PRESERVATION. FEAR OF\nMY MAJESTY. WHY ARE YOU NOT WARY OF THE LIGHTNING?\n“You won’t strike me down,” Vyre said.\nHOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?\n“I haven’t finished what I’m supposed to do,” Vyre said. “I still have a\ntruth to prove.”\nINTERESTING, Odium said. YOU RESPOND TO MY GIFT IN SUCH AN ODD WAY.\nYOU ARE BECOMING SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER BEFORE CREATED, VYRE.\n“Some people say I’ve become your avatar,” Vyre said. “That you act\nthrough me, control me.”\nOdium laughed. AS IF I WOULD GIVE SUCH POWER TO A MORTAL. NO, VYRE,\nYOU ARE UNIQUELY YOURSELF. SO INTERESTING.\n“I am unchained.”\nAND YET, YOU THINK SO OFTEN OF KALADIN.\n“I am … mostly unchained.”\nOdium leaned forward, lightning crackling across his carapaced body. I\nNEED YOU AT URITHIRU. WE CANNOT MAKE THE OATHGATES WORK, AND SO I\nNEED YOU TO TRANSPORT THE GROUND FORCES. I SUSPECT YOUR SWORD WILL\nSTILL FUNCTION.\n“I will go right away,” Vyre said. “But I thought you didn’t want me\nthere.”\nI WORRY ABOUT THE EFFECT yOUR FRIEND HAS ON YOU.

She’d been\ndoing it for years, and she did get a thrill when she saw their starvin’ faces.\nThey’d turn away, then when they looked back, their chouta wrap would be\ngone. Or they’d lift the cover on their meal, and find the plate empty. After\nthat came the most sublime moment of cross-eyed panic and confusion.\nBut then they’d smile and look to see where she was. They didn’t see\nher, of course. She was way too good at hidin’. But they’d look, and they\nseemed fond.\nYou weren’t supposed to be fond when someone stole from you. Ruined\nthe entire experience.\nThen there was this. She stretched a little farther, fingers brushing the\nbasket.…\nThere. She snatched the handle.\nShe stuffed the handle between her teeth, scuttled up the rope, then\nvanished into the hidden labyrinth of small tunnels that latticed the ceilings\nand walls of Urithiru. Up here Wyndle waited, coiled up on himself and\nmaking a face out of vines and crystal.\n“Oh!” he said. “A full basket! Let’s see what he left you this time!”\n“Ain’t nobody leaving me nothin’,” Lift snapped. “I stole it, unfair and\nsquare. Also hush. Someone might hear.”\n“They can’t hear me, mistress. I am—”\n“I can hear you. So hush, whineyspren.” She crept down the tunnel.\nThere was an Everstorm going on right now, and she wanted to be safe at\nher nest. The things felt creepy in ways that the other Radiants didn’t seem\nto notice. And even though everything seemed normal in the tower, she\ncouldn’t help noticing the strange sensation that everything was wrong.\nShe felt that every time though. So today, she just pushed the basket\nahead of her as she crawled through the small tunnel. The next intersection\nwas a tight squeeze, but she could make herself slick with Stormlight, so\nshe got through.\nTwo turns and a straight crawl later, they entered a small intersection\nwhere she’d left a sphere for light. The roof of the tunnel was a little higher\nhere, letting her settle with her back against the stone wall so she could\ninspect her prize.\nWyndle came in on the ceiling, taking the shape of a growing vine that\ncrept across the stone. He formed a face again right above her as she rifled\nthrough the basket. Flatbread … some curry … sugared mashed beans … a\nlittle jar of jam with a cute face drawn on top above the Horneater symbol\nfor “love.”\nLift glanced up at the ceiling and the blinking vine face hanging from it.\n“Fine,” she admitted. “Maybe he left it out for me.”\n“Maybe?”\n“Starvin’ stupid Horneater boy,” Lift grumbled, slathering jam on the\nflatbread. “His dad knew how to make it appear like an accident, leavin’\nstuff out so I could take it. Let me stormin’ pretend.”\nShe stuffed the bread into her mouth. Damnation. It was good.

The other cultivationspren thought it quite majestic. They\ncomplimented the stools in particular.”\nLift sighed, leaning back, slumping there. Too annoyed to even make a\ngood stool joke. She wasn’t really angry. Wasn’t really sad. Just …\nblarglegorf. Supremely blarglegorf.\nStorms. The wrap she wore underneath her shirt was itchy today. “Come\non,” she said, grabbing the basket and sphere, then moving on through the\ntower’s innards.\n“Is it really so bad?” Wyndle said, following. “Gift likes you. That is\nwhy he leaves things out for you.”\n“I’m not supposed to be liked,” Lift snapped. “I’m a shadow. A\ndangerous and unknown shadow, moving mysteriously from place to place,\nnever seen. Always feared.”\n“A … shadow.”\n“Yes, a starvin’ shadow, all right?” She had to squeeze through the next\ntunnel too. Stupid, stupid, stupid. “This tower, it’s like a big ol’ corpse. And\nI’m like blood, sneaking around through its veins.”\n“Why would a corpse have blood in its veins?”\n“Fine. It’s not dead. It’s sleepin’ and we are its stormin’ blood. All\nright?”\n“I should think,” Wyndle said, “these air vents are much more like\nintestines. So the allegory would make you more akin to … um … well,\nfeces I guess.”\n“Wyndle?” she said, pulling through.\n“Yes, mistress?”\n“Maybe stop tryin’ to help with my deevy metaphors.”\n“Yes, all right.”\n“Storming lamespren,” she muttered, finally reaching a section of larger\nair vents. She did like this tower. There were a lot of places to hide and to\nexplore. Up here in this network of stone ventilation shafts, she found the\noccasional mink or other scavenger, but it was actually her domain. The\nadults were too big, and the other children too frightened. Plus she could\nglow—when properly fed—and her awesomeness could get her through\ntight squeezes.\nA year ago, there hadn’t been nearly as many of those as there were now.\nStupid, stupid, stupid.\nThey eventually reached her nest, a large opening where four tall\nventilation shafts met. Here she’d piled up blankets, food stores, and some\ntreasures. One of Dalinar’s knives she was absolutely sure he hadn’t wanted\nher to steal. Some interesting shells. An old flute that Wyndle said looked\nstrange.\nThey were near a well where she could get all the water she wanted—but\nfar enough away from people that she could talk freely. Her previous nest\nhad let her listen in on the echoes of people nearby—but they’d also been\nable to hear her."

Her previous nest\nhad let her listen in on the echoes of people nearby—but they’d also been\nable to hear her.\nShe’d heard them talking about the echoing. The spirit of the tower,\nthey’d called her. That had been nifty at first, but then they’d started leaving\nstuff out for her, like she was the stormin’ Nightwatcher. And she’d started\nfeeling guilty. You can’t be taking stuff from people who don’t have much.\nThat was the first rule of not being a total-and-utter-useless-piece-of-chull-\ndung.\nShe munched on more of the “stolen” food from her basket, then sighed\nand got up. She stepped up to a side wall, putting her back to the stone.\n“Come on,” she said. “Do it.”\nWyndle moved up the wall. As always, he left a trail of vines behind\nhim. They would crumble and decay soon after, but could be used to mark\nsomething for a short time. He moved across the wall atop her head, then\nshe turned around and marked the line with a more permanent one out of\nchalk.\n“That’s almost a full inch since last time,” she said.\n“I’m sorry, mistress.”\nShe flopped down in her nest of blankets, wanting to curl up and cry.\n“I’ll stop eating,” she said. “That’ll stunt my growth.”\n“You?” Wyndle said. “Stop eating.”\nStorming spren. She pulled off her shirt, redid the wrap tighter—\nalthough it pinched her skin—then replaced her shirt. After that, she lay and\nstared up at the marks on the wall, which showed the progress of her height\nover the last year.\n“Mistress,” Wyndle said, curling up like an eel and raising a vine head\nbeside her. He was getting better at making faces, and this one was one of\nher favorites—it had vines that looked like little mustaches. “Don’t you\nthink it’s time you told me what exactly it was you asked the\nNightwatcher?”\n“Doesn’t matter,” she said. “It was all lies. The boon. The promises.\nLies, lies, lies.”\n“I have met the Nightwatcher,” Wyndle said. “She does not … think the\nsame way the rest of us do. Cultivation created her to be apart, separated\nfrom humankind, un-Connected. Mortal perception of the Nightwatcher\ndoes not influence her like it does other spren. Mother wanted a daughter\nwhose shape and personality would grow organically.\n“This makes the Nightwatcher less … well, human … than a spren like\nme. Still, I don’t believe her capable of lying. It isn’t something she could\nconceive of, I believe.”\n“She’s not the liar,” Lift said, closing her eyes. Storms. She’d made the\nwrap too tight. She could barely breathe. “It’s the other one. The one with a\ndress like leaves, merging into the underbrush. Hair like twigs. Skin the\ncolor of deep brown stone.”\n“So you did see Cultivation herself.

Why, seeing\ninto the Cognitive Realm—even a little—is an uncommon feature in a\nhuman! And turning food into Light. Why … if Mother is involved …\nperhaps this isn’t Stormlight you use at all. Hmm … You realize how\nspecial you are, Lift.”\n“I didn’t want to be special.”\n“Says the girl who was comparing herself so dramatically to a shadow\nearlier.”\n“I just wanted what I asked for.”\n“Which was?” Wyndle asked.\n“Not important now.”\n“I rather think it is.”\n“I asked not to change,” Lift whispered, opening her eyes. “I said, when\neverything else is going wrong, I want to be the same. I want to stay me.\nNot become someone else.”\n“Those are the exact words?” Wyndle asked.\n“Best I can remember.”\n“Hmm…” Wyndle said, snuggling down into his vines. “I believe that is\ntoo vague.”\n“I wasn’t! I told her. Make me so I don’t grow up.”\n“That is not what you said, mistress. And if I might be so bold—having\nspent a great deal of time around you—you are not an easy person to\nunderstand.”\n“I asked not to change! So why am I changing?”\n“You’re still you. Merely a bigger version.”\nShe squeezed her eyes shut again.\n“Mistress,” Wyndle said. “Lift. Will you tell me why this bothers you so\nmuch? Everyone grows. Everyone changes.”\n“But I’m … I’m her little girl.”\n“Whose little girl?” he asked gently. “Your mother’s?”\nLift nodded. Stupid. It sounded stupid and she was stupid. Mother was\ndead. That was that.\nWhy hadn’t she said the correct words? Why hadn’t Cultivation just\nunderstood? Cultivation was supposed to be some sort of starvin’ god. It\nwas her fault if a little girl came and begged for a promise, and the god\ndeliberately misinterpreted and …\nAnd Lift liked who she was. Who she had been.

And I was her little girl.\nIf she saw me now, she wouldn’t recognize me.\nA few strange spren, like faces mocking her, faded in nearby. Wyndle\nslowly wrapped his vines around her.

For once he didn’t ruin the sentiment by saying something dumb.\nAnd then he perked up in a suspicious-like way.\nLift wiped her eyes. “What?” she demanded.\n“I don’t know,” Wyndle said. “Something just happened. In the tower. I\nfeel … a darkness resting on me like a blanket. I think I felt the tower stir.”\n“You said the tower’s spren was dead.”\n“Dead spren can stir, Lift,” Wyndle said. “Something is wrong.\nSomething is very wrong.”\nLift grabbed a large piece of flatbread and stuffed it in her mouth. Then\nshe scurried through the tunnels, Wyndle following. She tried to use\nStormlight to make her body slick to get through a particularly tight\nsqueeze, but it didn’t work. She frowned, tried again, then finally forced\nherself through without it.\nWhat on Roshar?\nShe came out above an empty room at the perimeter of the tower. She\ndropped from the opening in the ceiling, then trotted to the window. It was\nnearing evening, and the Everstorm had passed. Nothing looked wrong\nabout the tower from her vantage; just an average day up in the mountains.\n“Something’s wrong with my powers,” she whispered as Wyndle\nlowered himself from the top of the windowsill. “I couldn’t become\nawesome.”\n“Look, down there.”\nSome people had gathered on the Oathgate platform to the Shattered\nPlains. Several figures who seemed to have fallen to the ground. Blue\nuniforms.\n“Windrunners,” she said, squinting. “Somethin’s wrong with them.\nMaybe they broke the Oathgates?”\n“Maybe.”\nLift searched out across the snowy landscape, trying to listen. Listen.\nThe Sleepless had told her, Always listen.\nShe heard screams. But not human ones.\n“There,” she said, pointing. “What’s that?”\nA bright red something was flying through the air in a desperate loop—\nbeing chased by something else that was green. Faster, more dangerous.\nThe two collided in midair, and when the red something tore away, it\ndropped feathers in the sky.\nChickens. Flying chickens. She didn’t need to be told to instinctively\nunderstand that the green one was the predator, while the red one was prey.\nIt gave a few beleaguered flaps toward the tower, seeming barely able to\nstay in the air.\n“Come on,” Lift said, swinging out the window. “I need handholds.”\n“Oh, mistress!” Wyndle said, moving onto the outside of the tower. He\nwove back and forth to make a ladder of vines clinging to the stone, which\nshe climbed. “We are far too high up for this! What if I drop!”\n“You’re a stormin’ spren. You’d be fine.”\n“We don’t know that!” he said. “I could fall hundreds of feet!”\n“Cowardspren.”\n“Wisdomspren, if anything!” he said, but kept weaving as she scrambled\nupward.\nThe red chicken barely dodged another attack in the sky before darting in"

The green chicken\nrounded, and she got a good look at it. Wicked talons, a sharp knifelike\nbeak. She’d always thought chickens looked silly, but this one was\ndifferent.\nShe reached the balcony and found the red one on the floor, bleeding\nfrom one wing, trying weakly to right itself. It was bigger than she’d\nthought, at least a foot tall, with a vivid red body and head. It had bright\nblue wings that went red at the ends, like fire. It chirped weakly as it saw\nher.\nShe perched on the rim of the balcony and turned to see the green one\ncoming in. “Wyndle, I need you,” she said, holding her hand to the side to\nmake him into a weapon. Not a sword. She hated those things. A rod she\ncould swing at the nightmare chicken.\nNothing happened.\n“I can’t become a weapon, mistress!” Wyndle cried. “I don’t know why!\nIt’s something about the wrongness in the tower!”\nFine. She didn’t need a weapon anyway. The green chicken came\nswooping toward her, claws extended. It seemed to expect her to flinch. So\nshe didn’t. She took the hit directly in the face and grabbed the chicken as it\ntried to rake her with its claws.\nThen she bit it. Right on the wing.\nIts startled scream seemed more confused than pained, but it tore out of\nher grip and fluttered away, crying as if it thought Lift wasn’t playing fair.\nShe spat out a feather as Stormlight healed the cuts to her face. Well, at\nleast that part of her abilities was still working. She hopped down and\nscooped up the wounded red-feathered chicken. It gave her a timid bite on\nthe arm, and she glared at it.\n“You ain’t in any position to complain,” she said, then tried to heal it.\nShe pressed her Light into the body, and it resisted. The healing didn’t work\neither. Damnation.\nThe chicken calmed as she hurried into the room beyond, where a young\nlighteyed man had been walking to the balcony to see what the fuss was.\n“Sorry,” Lift said. “Important Radiant business.” As he leaped back,\nstartled, she snatched a limafruit off his table, then hurried out into the\nhallway beyond.\nLet’s see … fifth floor …\nShe found her way to one of the ventilation openings, and Wyndle made\na ladder for her to climb up—the red chicken under her arm complaining\nsoftly about the treatment. Inside, safely around a few corners, she put the\nchicken on the floor, then pressed her hand to it again.\nShe pushed harder. When she’d tried to become awesome earlier,\nnothing had happened. But when she’d tried to heal, she’d felt something\ndifferent—a resistance. So this time she pushed it, growling softly until …\nit worked. Stormlight left her, and the chicken’s wing healed.

Damnation take me if I can figure out how that applies to chickens\nthough.”\nThe chicken squawked. She tried to summon her awesomeness, but that\npower didn’t merely resist. It seemed to not exist. As she tried again, she\nheard something odd. People shouting?\n“Wyndle?” she asked.\nHe moved away as a vine. People could sometimes notice the remnants\nof those vines when they disintegrated, but he himself was invisible.\nThe chicken began walking away down the tunnel. It had a funny stride,\nlike it was indignant about being forced to use its feet.\nLift hurried forward and blocked it off. “Where do you think you’re\ngoing?”\nIt squawked insistently, then squeezed past her.\n“At least wait for Wyndle,” she said, blocking it off again. It let out a\nmore threatening squawk, but soon Wyndle returned.\n“Radiants are dropping unconscious!” he said. “Oh, mistress. This seems\nvery bad!”\nThe chicken, uncaring, pushed past her and continued along the tunnel.\nTogether she and Wyndle followed, the spren growing increasingly worried\n—particularly after the bird fluttered down into a corridor, then stared at the\nground and chirped in an annoyed way.\nIt turned toward her, plaintive.\n“You need to go down lower,” she said, “but you don’t know how? What\nare you following?”\nIt squawked.\n“Mistress,” Wyndle said, “chickens are not intelligent. Talking to one\nwould make me question your intelligence, if I hadn’t seen you talk to\ncremlings sometimes.”\n“Never can tell if one of those is reporting back to someone or not,” she\nmuttered, then climbed down and picked up the chicken. It seemed to have\ntrouble flying without all its feathers, so she carried it as they used the stairs\nto descend several levels, following the chicken’s body language. It would\nstretch out its head, then cock it, looking at the floor with one eye. When\nthey got to the second level, it leveled out its head, staring insistently along\na corridor, and made a kind of hooting noise.\nSomething distant rumbled from one of the corridors behind them. Lift\nspun, and Wyndle whimpered.\n“That was thunder,” she said. “There are stormforms in the tower.”\n“Oh, mistress!” Wyndle cried. “We should do something! Like hide! Or\nrun away and then hide!”\nInstead she followed the chicken’s gaze. She was supposed to listen. It\nwas one of her stormin’ oaths, or something. She hurried through a side\npassage as the chicken started to squawk louder.\n“Mistress?” Wyndle said. “Why are we…”\nHe trailed off as they stumbled across the corpse.\nIt was an old Alethi man in robes.

She never had gotten used to this sort of thing.\nThe chicken let out an angry screech, fluttering out of her hands to the\nman. Then—in perhaps the most heart-wrenching thing she’d ever seen—it\nbegan to nuzzle the corpse and chirp softly. It climbed into the crook of his\ndead arm and pushed its head against his side, chirping again, more worried\nthis time.\n“I’m sorry,” Lift said, squatting down. “How did you know he was\nhere?”\nIt chirped.\n“You could feel him, couldn’t you?” she asked. “Or … you could feel\nwhere he’d been. You’re no ordinary chicken. Are you a Voidbringer\nchicken?”\n“Why,” Wyndle said, “do you insist on using that word? It’s horribly\ninaccurate.”\n“Shut it, Voidbringer,” she muttered at him. She reached over and\ncarefully picked up the chicken, who had begun to let out pained chirps\nalmost like words. Eerily similar to them, in fact.\n“Who was he?” she asked. “Wyndle, do you recognize him?”\n“I believe I’ve seen him before. A minor Alethi functionary, though his\neyes are different now. Curious. Look at his fingers—tan skin with bands of\nlighter skin. He was wearing jewelry once.”\nYes … thinking about it, she thought she recognized him. One of the old\npeople in the tower. Retired, once an important official in the palace. She’d\ngone and talked to him because nobody paid attention to old people. They\nsmelled.\n“Robbed,” she said. Back-alley killings still happened in this tower,\nthough the Kholins tried to make the place safe. “I’ll remember you. I\npromise. I—”\nSomething moved in the darkness nearby. A kind of scraping sound,\nlike … feathers. Lift went alert and stood, holding out a sphere for light. It\nhad come from farther down the corridor, where her light didn’t reach.\nSomething flowed from that darkness. A man, tall with scarred features.\nHe wore an Alethi uniform, but she swore she’d never seen him before. She\nwould recognize a man this dangerous. Those eyes seemed to be part of the\ndarkness—deep in shadow as he stepped into the light.\nOn his shoulder sat the green chicken from before, its wicked claws\ngripping a patch of leather affixed to the uniform.\n“Little Radiant,” the man said. “I’ll admit, I’ve always wanted an excuse\nto hunt you.”\nShe clutched her red chicken and started running.\nThe man behind her laughed.

He was now to\ngive the order for his men to betray the coalition. If Taravangian’s guesses\nwere right, it also meant Odium had launched an attack on Urithiru.\nTaravangian did not give the order yet. Odium had said he would come\nto confirm, and so far he hadn’t.

When had he last been intelligent? Not\nbrilliant—he’d given up on feeling that way again—but merely smart? The\nlast time had been … storms, over a year ago. When he’d planned how to\ndestroy Dalinar.\nThat attempt had failed. Dalinar had refused to be broken. Smart\nTaravangian, for all his capacities, had proven insufficient.\nSmart Taravangian came up with the plan that forced Odium to make a\ndeal, he thought.

Compassion on the other. When smart, he assumed\nthe compassion was the curse. But was it really? Or was the curse that he\ncould never have both at once?\nHe stood up in the wagon, and withstood the moment of dizziness that\ntook him each time he stood these days: blackness creeping at the edges of\nhis vision, like deathspren eager to claim him. He thought perhaps it was his\nheart, though he had not asked for a surgeon. Best not to trouble someone\nwho could be helping wounded soldiers.\nHe breathed out in short breaths, listening to the soft cracks of the\nEverstorm outside. The thunder was ebbing. Almost at the end.\nHe shuffled the short distance to his trunk. Here, Taravangian forced\nhimself to kneel. Storms, when had kneeling become so painful? His bones\nground against one another like a pestle against its bowl.\nTrying not to focus on the painspren, he fumbled at the lock’s\ncombination with trembling fingers, then unhooked the lid. He undid the\ntrunk’s lining on the top, reached to the secret compartment and flipped a\nhidden latch. That disengaged the small ink vial he’d rigged to spill and ruin\nthe contents of the compartment if it was tampered with.\nOnly then could he feel around inside and locate the pages. He pulled\nthem out with a tentative hand. A year ago, during his most recent bout of\nintelligence, he’d created this.

In the end, that\nploy had only galvanized the Blackthorn—and increased his suspicion of\nTaravangian. Before that day, they had been friends.\nTaravangian turned this page over in his fingers, trying to understand the\nstrange creature he became when intelligent. A being unburdened by\nempathy, capable of seeing straight to the heart of matters. Yet also a being\nwho couldn’t understand the context of his efforts. He would work to\npreserve a people at the same time he casually ordered the deaths of\nchildren.\nSmart Taravangian knew the how but not the why.\nDumb Taravangian didn’t make connections, didn’t remember things\nquickly, couldn’t compute in his head. In this document—intended to\ndemoralize, defame, and destroy a man he dearly respected—dumb\nTaravangian found pain. He was weeping by the time he finished reading it,\nand the exhaustionspren had been replaced by the white petals of\nshamespren.\nAll this, he thought, to save a handful of people? He’d preserved\nKharbranth by selling out the rest of humankind. He was certain Odium\ncould not be defeated. And so, saving a remnant was the only logical path.\nRight now, that seemed pathetic. Smart Taravangian considered himself\nso brilliant, so masterful, but this was the best he could do?\nIt was a dangerous line of thought. And pointless. Hadn’t he told off\nMrall for making this very argument? They had to focus on what they could\ndo. Smart Taravangian understood that, and had accomplished it.\nDumb Taravangian instead wept for all the people he had failed. All the\npeople who would die when Odium scoured the world of humankind.\nTaravangian looked back at the notes, and today saw something new in\nthem. A small comment about a specific person. Why specifically can’t the\nDiagram see Renarin Kholin? the notes read. Why is he invisible?\nSmart Taravangian had moved on quickly from this question. Why waste\ntime on something minor that you couldn’t solve? Dumb Taravangian"

Dumb Taravangian\nlingered on it, remembering a later time when he’d been visited by Odium.\nOdium had shown Taravangian something, and Renarin … Renarin Kholin\nhad appeared as a chain of blacked-out futures, unseeable.\nThe wagon began to grow lighter around Taravangian. He cursed under\nhis breath, quickly folding the papers together and hiding them in the\npocket of his robes. In an instant, the stormwagon melted away—walls\nvanishing before a brilliant golden light. The floor changed, and\nTaravangian found himself sitting in his chair on a brilliant field, the ground\nmade as if from solid gold.\nA figure stood in front of him, a twenty-foot-tall human bearing a\nscepter. His features were Shin, and his hair and beard were completely\ngold, as if he were Iriali. Odium’s robes were more ornate than last time,\nred and gold, with a sword tied at the waist.\nIt was a presentation meant to stun and awe, and Taravangian couldn’t\nhelp but gasp. It was so gorgeous. He forced himself out of his seat, falling\nagain on painful knees, bowing his head but unable to tear his eyes away\nfrom the magnificent display.\n“I prefer you when you are like this, Taravangian,” Odium said with a\npowerful voice. “You may not think as quickly, but you do understand more\nquickly.”\n“My lord,” Taravangian said. “Is it time?”\n“Yes,” Odium said. “You are to send the orders.”\n“It will be done.”\n“Will they obey, Taravangian? You ask them to turn against their allies.\nTo side with the enemy.”\n“The Alethi are their enemies, Lord,” Taravangian said. “The Vedens\nhave hated their neighbors for centuries. Plus their new leaders—installed\nby your own hand—are hungry for power. They believe you will reward\nthem.”\nThey had not obtained promises. A god could be bound, but only by\noaths. These foolish men believed that they’d be rewarded above the others,\nbut Taravangian knew their entire country was doomed. Every human in\nthose lands would eventually be destroyed.\nThey were oblivious of this fate, and Taravangian was confident they\nwould do as they were told and attack their former allies. He had spent a\nyear preparing them, promoting the right men at Odium’s command, subtly\nindicating to all who followed him that the war was a problem for Alethkar\nand Azir, not for Jah Keved. That the enemy would never come for them.\nHe looked up to find the god inspecting him with a curious expression.\n“Do you not fear death, Taravangian?” Odium asked. “You know you are\ndoomed.”\n“I…” Taravangian trembled. He tried not to think about it too much,\nparticularly when he was stupid. Because yes, he did fear death. He feared\nit terribly. He hoped that beyond death there was nothing. Oblivion.\nFor if anything else awaited him, it would not be pleasant.\n“I do fear it,” he whispered.\n“So honest, this version of you,” Odium said. He walked around"

He walked around\nTaravangian, who continued to kneel. “I much prefer it, yes. There is a\nstraightforwardness to your Passion.”\n“Could you not spare them?” Taravangian asked, tears in his eyes. “The\npeople of Jah Keved, the Iriali, those who come to you willingly. Why\nwaste their lives?”\n“Oh, I will not waste them, Taravangian,” Odium said. “Their lives will\nbe spent as they expect—in war, in glory, in blood. I will give them exactly\nwhat they’ve been asking for. They don’t know it, but they beg me for death\nin their requests for power. Only you have begged me for peace.”\nHe looked to Taravangian. “Kharbranth will remain an eye of calm in the\nstorm to come. Do not let the others concern you. They will fight in the war\nthey’ve been promised since birth, and though it will consume and destroy\nthem, they will enjoy it. I shall make certain of that fact. Even if they will\nnot be led in this glory by the one who should have been their king…”\nAs the god mused, Taravangian noticed something—a light emanating\nfrom Odium. It pulsed, making his skin transparent, glowing from within.\nThere was a … sickly feel to it somehow. Indeed, Odium stopped and\nseemed to concentrate, making the light retreat before continuing.\nI have failed in many ways, but you failed too, Taravangian thought at\nthe god. The “one who should have been their king” was in reference to\nDalinar. Odium had been planning for something for many years, a war far\ngreater—even—than the one that now consumed Roshar. Some strange\nbattle for the heavens.\nHe had wanted Dalinar for this war, but had failed to secure him. Odium\nstill intended to use all of humankind as his frontline troops, once he won\nRoshar. He would throw their lives away, turn them into slaves focused on\nfueling his war for the heavens. He would use their blood to preserve the\nsingers, which Odium saw as more valuable troops.\nMerely considering all this horrified Taravangian. It was even worse than\nthe quick and swift destruction he’d been imagining. This would be a\ndrawn-out nightmare of slavery, blood, and death. Yet one thought\ncomforted him. One that smart Taravangian would have discarded as\nsentimental.\nYou expected Dalinar to turn, Taravangian thought. You wanted him for\nyour champion. You failed. So in the end, you were no smarter than I was.\nAnd for all your boasting that you can see the future, you do not know\neverything.\nTaravangian had seen the god’s plans once. Could he … could he make it\nhappen again?\nNo. He didn’t dare plot. He wasn’t smart. He was … he was only a man.\nBut … who better to stand up for men everywhere? In a moment of\nimpassioned boldness, Taravangian reached into his pocket and took out the\npiece of the Diagram he’d worked on. He held it close, as if for comfort."

He strode over and snatched it from Taravangian’s\nfingers.\n“What is this?” Odium asked. “Ah … another piece of your Diagram, is\nit? Edited, I see. You think yourself so smart, do you.”\n“No,” Taravangian whispered, hoarse. “I know nothing.”\n“As well you should acknowledge it,” Odium said, then held the papers\nup before himself and shredded them in a flash of light. “This is nothing.\nYou are nothing.”\nTaravangian cried out, grabbing one of the pieces as it fluttered.\nOdium waved. And for a second time, Taravangian was given a glimpse\nof the god’s plans. Hundreds of thousands of panes of writing, hovering as\nif on invisible glass. This was what Odium had shown him a year ago; it\nwas intended to impress Taravangian with how thorough and extensive\nOdium’s planning was. And Taravangian had managed to tempt him into\nshowing it off, like a prized stallion.\nStorms … Odium could be tricked. By dumb Taravangian.\nTaravangian glanced around, trying to find the black portion he’d seen\nbefore. Yes, there it was, the corrupted writing, a section of plans ruined by\nRenarin Kholin.\nThe implications of that seemed profound now. Odium wasn’t able to see\nRenarin’s future. No one could.\nThe scar had expanded. Taravangian turned away quickly, not wanting to\ndraw Odium’s ire. Yet right before looking away, Taravangian saw\nsomething half-consumed in the black scar.\nHis own name. Why? What did it mean?\nI’m close to Renarin, Taravangian realized. Everyone close to the boy\nhas their future clouded. Perhaps that was why Odium was wrong about\nDalinar.\nTaravangian felt a surge of hope.\nOdium couldn’t see Taravangian’s future right now.\nTaravangian bowed his head and bit his lip, squeezing his eyes closed,\nhoping the tears at the corners of his eyes would be mistaken for tears of\nawe or fear.\n“Resplendent, isn’t it?” Odium asked. “I’ve wondered why she would\ngive you a taste of what we can do. In some ways, you’re the only one I can\ntalk to. The only one who understands, if in a limited way, the burden I\nbear.”\nYou could have simply come and given me the order today, then left,\nTaravangian thought. You talk instead. You’re lonely. You want to show off.\nYou’re … human.\n“I will miss you,” Odium said. “I’m pleased that you made me promise\nto keep the humans of Kharbranth alive. They will remind me of you.”\nIf Odium could be lonely, if he could boast, if he could be tricked … he\ncould be afraid. Taravangian might be dumb, but when dumb, he\nunderstood emotion.\nOdium had incredible power; that was clear. He was a god, in power. But"

In mind he was a man. What did Odium fear? He would have\nfears, wouldn’t he? Taravangian opened his eyes and scanned through the\nmany hovering panes of description. Many were in languages he couldn’t\nread, but Odium used glyphs for names.\nTaravangian looked for a knot of tight writing. He looked for letters that\nevoked terror—the terror of a genius. He found them, understanding them\nwithout being able to read them, in a knot near the black scar. Words written\nin cramped letters, circling a name being consumed by the scar. A simple,\nterrifying name.\nSzeth. The Assassin in White.\nTrembling, Taravangian turned away. Odium began ranting again, but\nTaravangian missed what the creature said.\nSzeth.\nThe sword.\nOdium feared the sword.\nExcept … Szeth was at Urithiru. Why was his name being consumed by\nthe scar that represented Renarin? It didn’t make any sense. Could\nTaravangian have misunderstood?\nIt took him a painfully long time to see the obvious answer. Szeth was\nhere, in the army, near Dalinar. Who was in turn near Renarin. Dalinar must\nhave brought Szeth in secret.\n“You cannot conceive how long I’ve planned for this,” Odium was\nsaying—though the light was building within him again, his skin like thin\npaper. He seemed … not weak—a being who could spawn storms and\ndestroy entire nations would never be weak. But vulnerable.\nOdium had bet so much upon Dalinar being his champion. Now that was\nin chaos. The god bragged about his plans, but Taravangian knew firsthand\nthat you could plan and plan and plan, but if one man’s choices didn’t align\nto your will, it didn’t matter. A thousand wrong plans were no more useful\nthan a single wrong one.\n“Don’t be too pained, Taravangian,” Odium said. “Dalinar won’t kill you\nimmediately. He’ll seek to understand; it has become his way. Poor fool.\nThe old Blackthorn would have immediately murdered you, but this weaker\nversion won’t be able to help himself. He’ll need to talk to you before he\norders your execution.”\nYou’re doing the same, Taravangian thought, a dangerous plan budding\nin his mind. You should have killed me.\nOut loud he said, “So be it. I have accomplished my goal.”\n“So you have,” Odium said. “So you have. Go, my son. Make good on\nyour part of our compact, and earn salvation for those you love.”\nThe golden expanse faded, depositing Taravangian on the floor of his\nstormwagon. He opened his hand, finding the fragment of the Diagram in it.\nBut … the other pieces were gone. They had vanished when the vision\nended. That stunned him, for it implied that he had truly been in another\nplace.

He took a moment to recover before digging into his satchel. He\nbrought out the spanreed board, oriented it, and positioned the pen. When\nhe finally got a response, he wrote out two simple words.\nDo it.\nHe had to go through with the betrayal, of course. He needed to keep his\nagreement; he had to protect Kharbranth. That came before any other plots\nor plans. And any other such plots would have to be executed in such a way\nthat Odium either did not know what he’d done, or couldn’t act against him\nto remove Kharbranth’s protections.\nIt took less than fifteen minutes for Dalinar’s soldiers to arrive and break\ninto his wagon, shattering the door and storming in with weapons drawn.\nYes, they’d been waiting for this betrayal. Odium had his distraction.\nThey’d need to dedicate weeks of frantic work to be certain the Veden\narmies didn’t gain too much of an advantage—and Dalinar would be\noccupied here, fighting off Taravangian’s soldiers.\nTaravangian groaned as the soldiers seized his spanreeds, a scribe among\nthem reading the two words he’d sent.\nThey didn’t harm him. Odium was probably right. Taravangian likely\nhad a few weeks before his execution. He found that he hurt less, felt less\ntired, as they bound and gagged him. It was painful, yes, but he could suffer\na little pain. For he knew something powerful. A quiet, furtive secret as\ndangerous as the Diagram had been.\nTaravangian had decided not to give up.\nI find this format most comfortable, as it is how I’ve collaborated in\nthe past.

A phantom cracking, like glass shattering.\nEach painful step took him farther from his family, farther from peace.\nFarther into the darkness. He’d made his decision. He would not leave his\nfriend to the whims of enemy captivity. But though he’d finally thought to\ntake off his bloodied shoes—and now carried them with the laces looped\naround his neck—he still felt as if he were leaving stained tracks behind\nhim.\nStorms.

He would\nhave time later to ruminate on what he’d done. For now, he needed to find a\nsafe place to hide. The tower was no longer home, but an enemy fortress.\nSyl zipped out in front of him, checking each intersection before he\narrived.

He hadn’t even thought to take the stormform’s axe. That left him\nunarmed, save for a scalpel. He was too used to having Syl as his\nShardspear, but if she couldn’t transform—\nNo, he thought to himself. No thoughts. Thoughts are dangerous. Just\nmove.\nHe pushed forward, relying on Syl, who sped toward a stairwell. The\neasiest way to lose themselves would be to find a hiding place on the\nuninhabited floors, perhaps somewhere on eleven or twelve. He took the\nstairs two at a time, propelled by the pulsing Light in his veins. His glow\nwas enough to see by. Teft began muttering quietly, perhaps responding to\nthe jostling.\nThey reached the seventh floor, then started straight up toward the\neighth. Here, Syl led him farther inward. Try as he might to ignore them,\nKaladin continued to hear the echoes of his failure. His father’s shouts. His\nown tears …\nHe’d been so close. So close.\nHe lost track of their location in the endless tunnels. The floor here\nwasn’t painted to give directions, so he trusted in Syl. She zipped ahead to\nan intersection, spun around in a circle a few times, then shot to the right.\nHe kept pace with her, though he was feeling Teft’s weight more and more.\n“Just a second,” he whispered to her at the next intersection, then rested\nagainst the wall—Teft still weighing heavily on his shoulders—and fished a\nchip from his pouch. The small topaz was barely enough to see by, but he\nneeded it as the Stormlight he was holding finally gave out. And he didn’t\nhave many spheres left.\nHe grunted under the weight of his friend, then pushed himself to stand\nup straight, clinging tightly to Teft with both hands while gripping the\nsphere between two fingers. He nodded to Syl, then continued after her,\npleased that his strength was holding. He could manage Teft without Light.\nDespite Kaladin’s last few weeks spent as a surgeon, his body was still that\nof a soldier.\n“We should go higher,” Syl said, floating alongside his head as a ribbon\nof light. “Can you manage?”\n“Get us to floor ten at least,” Kaladin said.\n“I’ll have to take us up stairwells as I see them. I don’t really know this\nsection of the tower.…”\nHe let himself sink into an old familiar mindset as they continued. Teft’s\nweight across his shoulders wasn’t that different from carrying a bridge. It\nbrought him back to those days. Running bridges. Eating stew.\nWatching his friends die … feeling terror anew each day …\nThose memories offered no comfort. But the rhythm of steps, carrying a\nburden, working his body on an extended march … it was at least familiar.\nHe followed Syl up one set of steps, then another. Then across another\nlong tunnel, the strata here waving vigorously like ripples in a churning\npond. Kaladin kept moving.\nUntil suddenly he came alert.\nHe couldn’t pinpoint what alarmed him, but he moved on instinct to\nimmediately cover his sphere and duck into a side passage. He stepped into"

Kaladin kept moving.\nUntil suddenly he came alert.\nHe couldn’t pinpoint what alarmed him, but he moved on instinct to\nimmediately cover his sphere and duck into a side passage. He stepped into\na nook and knelt to slide Teft off his shoulders. He pressed his hand against\nthe unconscious man’s mouth to silence his mumbling.\nSyl darted over a moment later. He could see her in the darkness, but she\ndidn’t illuminate things around her. He shoved his other hand in his pocket,\ntightly holding the sphere so it couldn’t give off any betraying illumination.\n“What?” Syl asked.\nKaladin shook his head. He didn’t know, but didn’t want to speak. He\nhuddled there—hoping Teft wouldn’t mutter or shift too loudly—his own\nheartbeat thumping in his ears.\nThen, faint red light crept into the hallway he’d left. Syl immediately\nzipped to hide her light behind Kaladin’s dark form.\nThe light approached, revealing a single ruby along with a pair of\nglowing red eyes. Those illuminated a terrible face. Pure black, with hints\nof marbled red under the eyes. Long dark hair, which appeared woven into\nhis simple wrap of clothing. It was the creature Kaladin had fought in\nHearthstone, the one he’d killed in the burning room of the mansion.\nThough the Fused had been reborn into a new body, Kaladin knew from the\nskin patterns that it was the same individual. Come for revenge.\nThe Fused didn’t seem to spot Kaladin hiding in the darkness, though he\ndid pause at the intersection for an extended period of time. He moved on,\nthankfully, going deeper along the path Kaladin had been taking.\nStorms … Kaladin had defeated the thing last time without any\nStormlight, but he had done so by playing on its arrogance. Kaladin\ndoubted it would let him get such an easy kill again.\nThose singers in the clinic … one of them mentioned that a Fused was\nlooking for me. They called him the Pursuer. This thing … it had come to\nthe tower specifically to find Kaladin.\n“Follow it,” he mouthed, turning to Syl, counting on her to understand\nhis meaning. “I’ll find someplace more secluded to hide.”\nShe wove her line of light into a brief luminescent representation of a\nkejeh glyph—meaning “affirmative”—then zipped after the Pursuer. She\ncouldn’t get too far from Kaladin anymore, but she should be able to follow\nfor a while. Hopefully she could do so circumspectly, as some of the Fused\ncould see spren.\nKaladin hauled Teft back up onto his shoulders, then struck out into the\ndarkness, barely allowing himself any light. There was always something\noppressive about being deep in the tower, feeling so far away from the sky\nand the wind—but it was worse in the darkness. He could all too easily\nimagine himself trapped in here without spheres, left to wander forever in a\ntomb of stone.\nHe wove through a few more turns, hoping to find a stairwell up to\nanother floor. Unfortunately, Teft started muttering again. Gritting his teeth,\nKaladin ducked into the first room he found—a place with a narrow\ndoorway. Here he set Teft down, then tried to stifle his noises."

I followed long enough to see him stop at the place\nwhere you hid a bit ago. He found a little smear of blood on the wall there. I\nhurried ahead of him, but he knows you’re nearby.”\nStorms. Kaladin glanced at his bloody clothing, then at Teft—who was\nmuttering despite Kaladin’s attempts to quiet him.\n“We need to lead the Pursuer away,” Kaladin whispered. “Be ready to\ndistract him.”\nShe made another affirmative signal. Kaladin left his friend as a restless\nlump in the darkness, then backtracked a little. He pulled up near an\nintersection, gripping his scalpel. He allowed no light other than Syl’s, his\nfew remaining infused spheres tucked away in his black pouch.\nHe took a few deep breaths, then mouthed his plan to Syl. She sailed\nfarther away through the black corridor, leaving Kaladin in total darkness.\nHe’d never been able to find the pure emptiness of mind that some\nsoldiers claimed to adopt in battle. He wasn’t certain he’d ever want\nsomething like that. However, he did compose himself, making his\nbreathing shallow, and came fully alert, listening.\nLoose, relaxed, but ready to come alight. Like tinder waiting for the\nspark. He was ready to breathe in his last spheres of Stormlight, but\nwouldn’t until the last moment.\nFootsteps scraped the corridor to Kaladin’s right, and the walls slowly\nbled with red light. Kaladin held his breath, ready, his back to the wall.\nThe Pursuer froze just before reaching the intersection, and Kaladin\nknew the creature had spotted Syl, who would have zipped past in the\ndistance. A heartbeat later, scraping noises announced the Pursuer dropping\nhis body as a husk—and a red ribbon of light rushed after Syl. The\ndistraction had worked. Syl would lead him away.\nAs far as they knew, the Fused couldn’t harm spren naturally—the only\nway to do so was with a Shardblade. Even that was temporary; cut spren\nwith a Shardblade, even rip them to pieces, and they eventually re-formed\nin the Cognitive Realm. Experiments had proven that the only way to keep\nthem divided was to store separate halves in gemstones.\nKaladin gave it ten heartbeats, then brought out a small sphere for light\nand dashed into the corridor—sparing a brief glance at the Pursuer’s\ndiscarded body—before running for the room where he’d put Teft.\nIt was amazing what a jolt of energy came from being so close to a fight.\nHe heaved Teft on his shoulders without trouble, then was jogging away in\nmoments—almost as if he were infused with Stormlight again. Using the\nlight of the sphere, he soon found a stairwell. He almost rushed up it, but a\nfaint light from above made him stop fast.\nVoices speaking to rhythms echoed from above. And from below, he"

He pulled into a side corridor, sweating in streams, fearspren\n—like globs of goo—writhing up through the stone beneath him.\nHe knew this feeling. Scurrying through the darkness. People with lights\nsearching in a pattern, hunting him. Breathing heavily, he hauled Teft\nthrough a different side passage, but soon spotted lights in that direction as\nwell.\nThe enemy was forming a noose, slowly tightening around his position.\nThat knowledge sent him into flashbacks of the night when he’d failed\nNalma and the others. A night when, like so many other times, he’d\nsurvived when everyone else had died. Kaladin wasn’t a runaway slave\nanymore, but the sensation was the same.\n“Kaladin!” Syl said, zipping up to him. “I was leading him toward the\nedge of the level, but we ran into some regular soldiers and he turned back.\nHe seemed to figure out I was trying to distract him.”\n“There are multiple squads up here,” Kaladin said, pulling into the\ndarkness. “Maybe a full company. Storms. The Pursuer must have\nrepurposed the entire force sent to go through homes on the sixth floor.”\nHe was shocked at the speed with which they’d set up the trap. He had to\nadmit that was likely the result of him letting a soldier run and tell the\nothers.\nWell, he doubted the enemy had found the time to appropriate one of\nNavani’s maps of this level. They couldn’t have managed to place people in\nevery hallway or stairwell. The net closing around him had to have gaps.\nHe began searching. Down a side corridor, he found shadowy figures\napproaching. And in the next stairwell. They were relentless, and\neverywhere. Plus, he didn’t know this area any better than they did. He\ntwisted around through a group of corridors until he reached a dead end. A\nquick search of the nearby rooms showed no other exits, and he looked over\nhis shoulder, hearing voices calling to one another. They spoke Azish, he\nthought—and to the rhythms.\nFeeling a sense of growing dread, he set Teft down, counted his few\nspheres, and took out his scalpel once more. Right. He’d … he’d need to\ntake a weapon from the first soldier he killed. A spear, hopefully. Something\nwith reach if he was going to survive a fight in these corridors.\nSyl landed on his shoulder and took the shape of a young woman, seated\nwith her hands in her lap.\n“We have to try to punch through,” Kaladin whispered. “There’s a\nchance they’ll send only a couple men this direction. We kill them, then slip\nout of the noose and run.”\nShe nodded.\nIt didn’t sound like a “couple men” though. And he was reasonably\ncertain he caught a harsher, louder voice among them. The Pursuer was still\ntracking him, possibly by the faint marks of blood smeared on the walls or\nfloor."

Not calm, but prepared. He gripped his scalpel in a reverse\ngrip—a hacking grip—for ramming into the space between carapace and\nneck. Standing there, he felt the weight of it all pressing down on him. The\ndarkness, both inside and out. The fatigue. The dread. Gloomspren like\ntattered pieces of cloth faded in, as if banners attached to the walls.\n“Kaladin,” Syl said softly, “could we surrender?”\n“That Fused isn’t here to take me captive, Syl,” he said.\n“If you die I’ll be alone again.”\n“We’ve slipped out of tighter problems than this.…” He trailed off as he\nglanced at her, sitting on his shoulder, seeming far smaller than usual. He\ncouldn’t force the rest of the words out. He couldn’t lie.\nLight began to illuminate the corridor, coming toward him.\nKaladin gripped his knife more tightly. A part of him seemed to have\nalways known it would come to this. Alone in the darkness, standing with\nhis back to the wall, facing overwhelming numbers. A glorious way to die,\nbut Kaladin didn’t want glory. He’d given up on that foolish dream as a\nchild.\n“Kaladin!” Syl said. “What’s that? On the floor?”\nA faint violet light had appeared in the crook of the rightmost corner.\nAlmost invisible, even in the darkness. Frowning, Kaladin left his post by\nthe door, inspecting the light. There was a garnet vein in the stone here, and\na small portion of it was glowing. As he tried to figure out why, the glow\nmoved—running along the crystal vein. He followed it to the doorway, then\nwatched it cross the hallway to the room on the other side.\nHe hesitated only briefly before putting away his weapon and hauling\nTeft onto his shoulders once again. He stumbled across the hallway outside\n—and one of the approaching people said something in Azish. It sounded\nhesitant, as if they hadn’t caught more than a glimpse of him.\nStorms. What was he doing? Chasing phantom lights, like starspren in\nthe sky? In this small chamber, the light moved across the floor and up the\nwall, revealing what appeared to be a gemstone embedded deeply in the\nstone.\n“A fabrial?” Syl said. “Infuse it!”\nKaladin breathed in some of his Stormlight, then glanced over his\nshoulder. Voices outside, and shadows. Rather than hold his Stormlight for\nthat fight, however, he did as Syl told him—pressing the Light into the\ngemstone. He had maybe two or three chips’ worth left after that. He was\npractically defenseless.\nThe wall split down the center. He gaped as the stones moved, but with a\nsilence that defied explanation. They cracked open just wide enough to\nadmit a person. Carrying Teft, he entered a hidden corridor.

Kaladin worried they had\nspotted the door closing, but he heard no scraping or pounding. They would\nspot the spren he’d drawn though, and would know he was close.\nKaladin needed to keep moving. The little violet light on the floor\ntwinkled and moved, so he lugged Teft after it through another series of\ncorridors. Eventually they reached a hidden stairwell that—blessedly—was\nundefended.\nHe climbed that, though each footfall was slower than the one before it\nand exhaustionspren hounded him. He kept moving somehow, as the light\nled him to the eleventh floor, and then into another dark room. The\noppressive silence told him he’d reached a portion of the tower the enemy\nwasn’t searching. He wanted to collapse, but the light pulsed insistently on\nthe wall—and Syl encouraged him to look.\nAnother embedded gemstone, barely visible. He used the last of his\nStormlight to infuse it, and slipped through the door that opened.

He instead slid\nto the cold stone floor, trembling.\nThere, he finally let himself drift to sleep.\nNINE YEARS AGO\nEshonai had been told that mapping the world removed its mystery. Some\nof the other listeners insisted the wilderness should be left uncharted—the\ndomain of the spren and the greatshells—and that by trying to confine it to\npaper, she risked stealing its secrets.\nShe found this to be flat-out ridiculous. She attuned Awe as she entered\nthe forest, the trees bobbing with lifespren, bright green balls with white\nspines poking out. Closer to the Shattered Plains, most everything was flat,\ngrown over by only the occasional rockbud. Yet here, not so far away,\nplants thrived in abundance.\nHer people made frequent trips to the forest to get lumber and\nmushrooms. However, they always took the exact same route. Up the river a\nday’s walk inward, gather there, then return. This time she’d insisted on\nleaving the party—much to their concern. She’d promised to meet them\nagain at their normal camp, after scouting the outer perimeter of the forest\nall the way around.\nAfter hiking around the trees for several days, she’d encountered the\nriver on the other side. Now she could cut back through the heart of the\nforest and reach her family’s camp from that direction. She’d bear with her\na new map that revealed exactly how large the forest was, at least on one\nside.\nShe started along the stream, attuned to Joy, accompanied by swimming\nriverspren. Everyone had been so worried about her being out in the storms\nalone. Well, she had been out in storms a dozen times in her life, and had\nsurvived with no trouble. Plus, she’d been able to move in among the trees\nfor shelter.\nHer family and friends were concerned nonetheless.

They spent their\nlives living in a very small region, dreaming of the day they could conquer\none of the ten ancient cities at the perimeter of the Shattered Plains. Such a\nsmall-minded goal. Why not strike out, see what else there was to the\nworld?\nBut no. Only one possible goal existed: win one of the cities. Seek\nshelter behind crumbling walls, ignoring the barrier the woods provided.\nEshonai considered it proof that nature was stronger than the creations of\nlisteners. This forest had likely stood when the ancient cities had been new.\nYet this forest still thrived, and those were ruins.\nYou couldn’t steal the secrets from something so strong just by exploring\nit. You could merely learn.\nShe settled down near a rock and unrolled her map, made from precious\npaper. Her mother was one of the few among all the families who knew the\nSong of Making Paper, and with her help, Eshonai had perfected the\nprocess. She used a pen and ink to sketch the path of the river as it entered\nthe forest, then dabbed the ink until it was dry before rerolling the map.\nThough she was confident, Resolve attuned, the others’ complaints had\nbeen particularly bothersome lately.\nWe know where the forest is and how to reach it. Why map its size? What\nwill that help?\nThe river flows this direction. Everyone knows where to find it. Why\nbother putting it on paper?\nToo many of her family wanted to pretend the world was smaller than it\nwas. Eshonai was convinced that was why they continued to squabble with\nthe other listener families. If the world consisted only of the land around the\nten cities, then fighting over that land made sense.\nBut their ancestors hadn’t fought one another. Their ancestors had turned\ntheir faces to the storm and marched away, abandoning their very gods in\nthe name of freedom. Eshonai would use that freedom. Instead of sitting by\nthe fire and complaining, she would experience the beauties Cultivation\noffered. And she would ask the best question of them all.\nWhat will I discover next?\nEshonai continued walking, judging the river’s course. She used her own\nmethods of counting the distance, then rechecked her work by surveying\nsights from multiple angles. The river continued flowing for days once a\nstorm passed. How? When all other water had drained away or been lapped\nup, why did this river keep going? Where did it start?\nRivers and their carapace-covered spren excited her. Rivers were\nmarkers, guideposts, roadways. You could never get lost if you knew where\nthe river was. She stopped for lunch near one of the bends, and discovered a\ntype of cremling that was green, like the trees. She’d never seen one that\nshade before. She’d have to tell Venli.\n“Stealing nature’s secrets,” Eshonai said to Annoyance. “What is a secret\nbut a surprise to be discovered?”\nFinishing her steamed haspers, she put out her fire and scattered the\nflamespren before continuing on her way. By her guess, it would take her a\nday and a half to reach her family. Then, if she left them again and rounded\nthe other side of the forest, she’d have a finished picture of how it looked."

Over its gurgling, she heard shouts in\nthe distance. Had the others come to find her? She hurried forward, attuning\nExcitement. Perhaps they were growing more willing to explore.\nIt wasn’t until she was almost to the sounds that she realized something\nwas very wrong with them. They were flat, no hint of a rhythm. As if they\nwere made by the dead.\nA moment later she rounded a bend and found herself confronted by\nsomething more wondrous—and more terrible—than she’d ever dared\nimagine.\nHumans.\n* * *\n“‘… dullform dread, with the mind most lost,’” Venli quoted. “‘The lowest,\nand one not bright. To find this form, one need banish the cost. It finds you\nand brings you to blight.’”\nShe drew in a deep breath and sat back in their tent, proud. All ninety-\none stanzas, recited perfectly.\nHer mother, Jaxlim, nodded as she worked the loom. “That was one of\nyour better recitations,” she said to Praise. “A little more practice, and we\ncan move to the next song.”\n“But … I got it right.”\n“You mixed up the seventh and fifteenth stanzas,” her mother said.\n“The order doesn’t matter.”\n“You also forgot the nineteenth.”\n“No I didn’t,” Venli said, counting them in her head. Workform? “… Did\nI?”\n“You did,” her mother said. “But you needn’t be embarrassed. You are\ndoing fine.”\nFine? Venli had spent years memorizing the songs, while Eshonai barely\ndid anything useful. Venli was better than fine. She was excellent.\nExcept … she’d forgotten an entire stanza? She looked at her mother,\nwho was humming softly as she worked the loom.\n“The nineteenth stanza isn’t that important,” Venli said. “Nobody is\ngoing to forget how to become a worker. And dullform. Why do we have a\nstanza about that? Nobody would willingly choose it.”\n“We need to remember the past,” her mother said to the Rhythm of the\nLost. “We need to remember what we passed through to get here. We need\nto take care not to forget ourselves.”\nVenli attuned Annoyance. And then, Jaxlim began to sing to the rhythms\nin a beautiful voice. There was something amazing about her mother’s\nvoice. It wasn’t powerful or bold, but it was like a knife—thin, sharp,\nalmost liquid. It cut Venli to the soul, and Awe replaced her Annoyance.\nNo, Venli wasn’t perfect. Not yet. But her mother was.\nJaxlim sang on, and Venli watched, transfixed, feeling ashamed of her\nearlier petulance. It was just so hard sometimes.

The two of them were nearly adults,\nonly a year off for Eshonai and a little more than two for Venli. They were\nsupposed to be responsible.\nHer mother eventually trailed off, after the tenth stanza.\n“Thank you,” Venli said.\n“For singing something you’ve heard a thousand times?”\n“For reminding me,” Venli said to Praise, “of what I am practicing to\nbecome.”\nHer mother attuned Joy and continued working. Venli strolled to the\ndoorway of the tent and peered out, where family members worked at\nvarious activities, like chopping wood and felling trees. Her people were the\nFirst-Rhythm family, and had a noble heritage. They were thousands strong,\nbut it had been many years since they’d controlled a city.\nThey kept talking of winning one back soon. Of how they’d strike out of\nthe forest and attack before a storm, claiming their rightful seat. It was an\nexcellent and worthy goal, yet Venli found herself dissatisfied as she\nwatched warriors making arrows and sharpening ancient metal spears. Was\nthis really what life amounted to? Fighting back and forth over the same ten\ncities?\nSurely there was more for them. Surely there was more for her. She had\ncome to love the songs, but she wanted to use them. Find the secrets they\npromised. Would Roshar create someone like Venli, only to have her sit in a\nhogshide tent and memorize words until she could pass them on, then die?\nNo. She had to have some kind of destiny. Something grand. “Eshonai\nthinks we should draw pictures to represent the verses of the songs,” Venli\nsaid. “Make stacks of papers full of pictures, so we won’t forget.”\n“Your sister has a wisdom to her at times,” her mother said.\nVenli attuned Betrayal. “She shouldn’t be off away from the family so\nmuch, being selfish with her time. She should be learning the songs like me.\nIt’s her duty too, as your daughter.”\n“Yes, you are correct,” Jaxlim said. “But Eshonai has a bold heart. She\nmerely needs to learn that her family is more important than counting the\nnumber of hills outside the camp.”\n“I have a bold heart!” Venli said.\n“You have a keen and crafty mind,” her mother said. “Like your mother.\nDo not dismiss your own talents because you envy those of another.”\n“Envy? Her?”\nVenli’s mother continued weaving. She wasn’t required to do such work\n—her position as keeper of songs was lofty, perhaps the most important in\nthe family. Yet her mother always sought to keep busy. She said working\nher hands kept her body strong, while going over songs worked her mind.\nVenli attuned Anxiety, then Confidence, then Anxiety again. She walked\nto her mother and sat on the stool next to her. Jaxlim projected Confidence,\neven when doing something as simple as weaving. Her complex skin\npattern of wavy red and black lines was among the most beautiful in the\ncamp—like true marbled stone.

In truth, Venli’s pattern had all three shades. Many\npeople claimed they couldn’t see the small patches of black at her neck, but\nshe could pick them out. Having all three colors was very, very rare.\n“Mother,” she said to Excitement, “I think I’ve discovered something.”\n“And what would that be?”\n“I’ve been experimenting with different spren again. Taking them into\nthe storms.”\n“You were cautioned about this.”\n“You didn’t forbid me, so I continued. Should we only ever do as we are\ntold?”\n“Many say we need no more than workform and mateform,” her mother\nsaid to Consideration. “They say that courting other forms is to take steps\ntoward forms of power.”\n“What do you say?” Venli asked.\n“You are always so concerned for my opinions. Most children, when\nthey reach your age, start to defy and ignore their parents.”\n“Most children don’t have you as a mother.”\n“Flattery?” Jaxlim said to Amusement.\n“Not … entirely,” Venli said. She attuned Resignation. “Mother, I want\nto use what I’ve learned. I have a head full of songs about forms. How can I\nhelp wanting to try to discover them? For the good of our people.”\nJaxlim finally stopped her weaving. She turned on her stool and scooted\ncloser to Venli, taking her hands. She hummed, then sang softly to Praise—\njust a melody, no words. Venli closed her eyes and let the song wash over\nher, and thought she could feel her mother’s skin vibrating. Feel her soul.\nVenli had done this as long as she could remember. Relying on her, and\nher songs. Ever since her father had left, seeking the eastern sea.\n“You make me proud, Venli,” Jaxlim said. “You’ve done well these last\nfew years, memorizing after Eshonai gave up. I encourage you to seek to\nimprove yourself, but remember, you must not become distracted. I need\nyou. We need you.”\nVenli nodded, then hummed the same rhythm, attuning Praise to be in\nsync with her mother. She felt love, warmth, acceptance from those fingers.\nAnd knew whatever else happened, her mother would be there to guide her.\nSteady her. With a song that pierced even storms.\nHer mother returned to her weaving, and Venli began to recite again. She\nwent through the entire thing, and this time did not miss a stanza.\nWhen she was done, she waited, taking a drink of water and hoping for\nher mother’s praise. Instead, Jaxlim gave her something better. “Tell me,”\nshe said, “of these experiments with spren you’ve been doing.”\n“I’m trying to find warform!” Venli said to Anticipation. “I’ve been\nstaying near the edge of the shelter during storms, and trying to attract the\nright spren. It is difficult, as most spren flee from me once the winds pick\nup.\n“However, this last time I feel I was close. A painspren is the key."

About warform?”\n“Naturally. If you are going to continue on this path, we will want their\nblessing.”\n“Maybe I should practice more,” Venli said. “Before we tell anyone.”\nJaxlim hummed to Reprimand. “This is like your refusal to perform the\nsongs in public. You are afraid of exposing yourself to failure again, Venli.”\n“No,” she said. “No, of course not. Mother, I just think this would be\nbetter if I knew for certain it worked. Before causing trouble.”\nWhy wouldn’t someone want to be certain before inviting ridicule by\nfailing? That did not make Venli a coward. She’d adopt a new form when\nnobody else had. That was bold. She wanted to control the circumstances,\nthat was all.\n“Come with me,” Jaxlim said to Peace. “The others have been discussing\nthis—I approached them after you asked me before. I hinted to the elders\nthat I thought adopting new forms might be possible, and I believe they are\nwilling to try.”\n“Really?” Venli asked.\n“Yes. Come. They will celebrate your initiative. That is too rare for us, in\nthis form. It is far better than dullform, but it does affect our minds. We\nneed other forms, despite what some may say.”\nVenli felt herself attuning Excitement as she followed her mother out of\nthe tent. If she did obtain warform, would it open her mind? Make her even\nmore bold? Quiet the fears and worries she often felt? She hungered for\naccomplishments. Hungered to make their world better, less dull, more\nvibrant. Hungered to be the one who carried her people to greatness. Out of\nthe crem and toward the skies.\nThe Five were gathered around the firepit amid the trees, discussing\noffensive tactics for the upcoming battle. That mostly equated to which\nboasts to make, and which warriors to let cast their spears first.\nJaxlim stepped up to the elders and sang a full song to Excitement. A\nrare delivery from the keeper of songs, and each stanza made Venli stand\ntaller.\nOnce the song was finished, Jaxlim explained what Venli had told her.\nIndeed, the elders were interested.

The Five hastened to grab their weapons—ancient axes,\nspears, and swords, each one precious and passed down for generations, for\nthe listeners had no means of creating new metal weapons.\nBut what could this be? No other family would attack them out here in\nthe wilderness. It hadn’t happened in generations, since the Pure-Song\nfamily had raided the Fourth-Movement family in an attempt to steal their\nweapons. The Pure-Songers had been thoroughly shunned for that action.\nVenli stayed back as the elders left. She didn’t wish to be involved in a\nskirmish—if indeed that was happening.

Hopefully whatever this\nwas, it would be over soon and she could return to basking in the respect of\nthe elders.\nSo it was that she was one of the last to hear about Eshonai’s incredible\ndiscovery.

And among the last to learn that her grand announcement had\nbeen utterly overshadowed by the actions of her reckless sister.\nI approach this project with an equal mixture of trepidation and hope.\nAnd I know not which should rule.\n—From Rhythm of War, page 1\nRaboniel denied Navani servants. The Fused apparently thought it would be\na hardship for Navani to live without them. So Navani allowed herself a\nsmall moment of pride when she stepped out of her rooms on the first full\nday of Urithiru’s occupation. Her hair was clean and braided, her simple\nhavah pressed and neat, her makeup done. Washing in cold water hadn’t\nbeen pleasant, but the fabrials weren’t working, so it wasn’t as if she could\nexpect warm water even if she had servants.\nNavani was led down to the library rooms in the basement of Urithiru.\nRaboniel sat at Navani’s own desk, going through her notes. Upon arriving,\nNavani bowed precisely, just low enough to indicate obedience—but not\nlow enough to imply subservience.\nThe Fused pushed back the chair and leaned an elbow on the desktop,\nthen made a shooing motion with a hummed sound to dismiss the guards.\n“What is your decision?” the Fused asked.\n“I will organize my scholars, Ancient One,” Navani said, “and continue\ntheir research under your observation.”\n“The wiser choice, and the more dangerous one, Navani Kholin.”\nRaboniel hummed a different tone. “I do not find the schematics for your\nflying machine in these notes.”\nNavani made a show of debating it, but she’d already considered this\nissue. The secrets of the flying platform would be impossible to keep; too\nmany of Navani’s scholars knew them. Beyond that, many of the new style\nof conjoined fabrials—which allowed lateral motion while maintaining\nelevation—were already in use around the tower. Though fabrials didn’t\nwork, Raboniel’s people could surely discern their operation.\nAfter a long debate with herself, she’d come to the conclusion that she\nneeded to give up this secret. Her best hope in escaping the current\npredicament was to appear to be willing to work with Raboniel, while also\nstalling."

Given time, I can draw for you the mechanism that makes\nthe machine work.”\nRaboniel hummed to a rhythm, but Navani couldn’t tell what it\nrepresented. However, Raboniel seemed skeptical as she stood and waved\nfor Navani to sit down. She placed a reed in Navani’s hands and folded her\narms to wait.\nWell, fine. Navani began drawing with quick, efficient lines. She made a\ndiagram of a conjoined fabrial, with a quick explanation of how it worked,\nthen she drew the expanded vision of hundreds of them embedded into the\nflying machine.\n“Yes,” Raboniel said as Navani sketched the last portions, “but how do\nyou make it move laterally? Surely with this construction, you could raise a\nmachine high in the air—but it would have to remain there, in one place.\nYou don’t expect me to believe that you have a ground machine moving in\nexact coordination to the one in the sky.”\n“You understand more about fabrials than I assumed, Lady of Wishes.”\nRaboniel hummed a rhythm. “I am a quick learner.” She gestured to the\nnotes on Navani’s desk. “In the past, my kind found it difficult to persuade\nspren to manifest themselves in the Physical Realm as devices. It seems\nVoidspren are not as naturally … self-sacrificing as those of Honor or\nCultivation.”\nNavani blinked as the implications of that sank in. Suddenly a dozen\nloose threads in her mind tied together, forming a tapestry. An explanation.\nThat was why the fabrials of the tower—the pumps, the climbing\nmechanisms—didn’t have gemstones with captive spren. Storms … that\nwas the answer to Soulcasting devices.\nAwespren burst around her in a ring of blue smoke. Soulcasters didn’t\nhold spren because they were spren. Manifesting in the Physical Realm like\nShardblades. Spren became metal on this side. Somehow the ancient spren\nhad been coaxed into manifesting as Soulcasters instead of Blades?\n“You didn’t know, I see,” Raboniel said, pulling a chair over for herself.\nEven sitting, she was a foot taller than Navani. She made such an odd\nimage: a carapace-armored figure, as if prepared for war, picking through\nnotes. “Odd that you should have made so many advances that we never\ndreamed of in epochs past, yet you’ve forgotten the far simpler method your\nancestors used.”\n“We … we didn’t have access to spren who would talk to us,” Navani\nexplained. “Vev’s golden keys … this … I can’t believe we didn’t see it.\nThe implications…”\n“Lateral movement?” Raboniel asked.\nFeeling almost in a daze, Navani sketched out the answer. “We learned\nto isolate planes for conjoined fabrials,” she explained. “You have to use\nthis construction of aluminum wires, rigged to touch the gemstone.

That\nmaintains vertical position, but allows the gemstone to be moved\nhorizontally.”\n“Fascinating,” Raboniel said. “Ralkalest—you call it aluminum in your\nlanguage—interfering with the Connection. That’s quite ingenious. It must\nhave taken a great deal of testing to get the correct configuration.”\n“Over a year’s worth,” Navani admitted. “After the initial possibility was\ntheorized. We have a problem that we can’t move vertically and laterally at\nthe same time—the fabrials that move us upward and downward are finicky,\nand we have been touching aluminum to them only after locking them into\nplace.”\n“That’s inconvenient.”\n“Yes,” Navani said, “but we’ve found a system where we stop, then do\nour vertical motions. It can be a pain, since spanreeds are very difficult to\nmake work in moving vehicles.”\n“It seems there should be a way to use this knowledge to make spanreeds\nthat can be used while moving,” Raboniel said, inspecting Navani’s sketch.\n“That was my thought as well,” Navani said. “I put a small team on it,\nbut we’ve been mostly occupied by other matters. Your weapons against our\nRadiants still confuse me.”\nRaboniel hummed to a quick and dismissive rhythm. “Ancient\ntechnology, barely functional,” she said. “We can suck the Stormlight from\na Radiant, yes—so long as they remain hanging there impaled by one of our\nweapons. This method does nothing to prevent the spren from bonding a\nnew Radiant. I should like it if your spren were easier to capture in\ngemstones.”\n“I’ll pass the request along,” Navani said.\nRaboniel hummed to a different rhythm, then smiled. It was difficult not\nto see the expression as predatory on her marbled face, with its lean danger.\nYet there was also something tempting about the efficiency of this\ninteraction. A few minutes of exchange, and Navani knew secrets she’d\nbeen trying to crack for decades.\n“This is how we end the war, Navani,” Raboniel said, standing. “With\ninformation. Shared.”\n“And this ends the war how?”\n“By showing everyone that our lives will all be improved by working\ntogether.”\n“With the singers ruling.”\n“Of course,” Raboniel said. “You are obviously a keen scholar, Navani\nKholin. If you could improve the lives of your people manyfold, is that not\nworth abandoning self-governance? Look what we’ve done in mere minutes\nby sharing our knowledge.”\nShared only because of your threats, Navani thought, careful not to show\nthat on her face. This wasn’t some free exchange. It doesn’t matter what you\ntell me, Raboniel. You can reveal any secret you desire—because I’m in\nyour power. You can just kill me once you have everything you want.\nShe smiled at Raboniel, however. “I would like to check on my scholars,\nLady of Wishes, to see how they’re being treated, and find out the extent of\nour … losses.” That made one point clear, Navani hoped.

        "text": "Lady of Wishes, to see how they’re being treated, and find out the extent of\nour … losses.” That made one point clear, Navani hoped. Some of her\nfriends had been murdered. She was not simply going to forget about that.\nRaboniel hummed, gesturing for Navani to join her. This was going to\nrequire a delicate balance, with both of them trying to play one another.\nNavani had to be explicitly careful not to let herself be taken in by\nRaboniel. That was one advantage Navani had over her scholars. She might\nnever be worthy to join them, but she did have more experience with the\nreal world of politics.\nRaboniel and Navani entered the second of the two library rooms—the\none with more desks and chairs. Navani’s best—ardents and scholars alike\n—sat on the floor, heads bowed. They’d plainly been made to sleep here,\njudging by the spread-out blankets.\nA few looked up to see her, and she noted with relief that Rushu and\nFalilar were both unharmed. She did a quick count, immediately picking out\nthe notable exceptions. She stepped over to Falilar, squatting down and\nasking, “Neshan? Inabar?”\n“Killed, Brightness,” he said softly. “They were in the crystal pillar\nroom, along with both of Neshan’s wards, Ardent Vevanara, and a handful\nof unfortunate soldiers.”\nNavani winced. “Pass the word,” she whispered. “For the time being, we\nare going to cooperate with the occupation.” She stopped by Rushu next. “I\nam glad you are well.”\nThe ardent—who had obviously been crying—nodded. “I was on my\nway down here to gather some scribes to help catalogue the destruction up\nin that room, when … this happened. Brightness, do you think it’s related?”\nIn the chaos, Navani had nearly forgotten the strange explosion. “Did\nyou by chance find any infused spheres in the wreckage?” Specifically, a\nstrange Voidlight one?\n“No, Brightness,” Rushu said. “You saw the place. It was in shambles.\nBut I did darken it to see if anything glowed, and saw nothing. Not a hint of\nStormlight, or even Voidlight.”\nAs Navani had feared. Whatever that explosion had been, it had to be\ntied to the strange sphere—and that sphere was likely now gone.\nNavani stood and walked back to Raboniel. “You didn’t need to kill my\nscholars during your attack. They were no threat to you.”\nRaboniel hummed to a quick-paced rhythm. “You will not be warned\nagain, Navani. You will use my title when addressing me. I do not want to\nsee you harmed, but there are proprieties thousands of years old that you\nwill follow.”\n“I … understand, Lady of Wishes. I think putting my remaining people\nto work immediately would be good for morale. What would you like us to\ndo?”\n“To ease the transition,” Raboniel said, “have them continue whatever\nthey were doing before my arrival.”\n“Many were working on fabrials, which will no longer function.”\n“Have them do design sketches then,” Raboniel said. “And write about\nthe experiments they’d done before the occupation.

I can see that their new\ntheories get tested.”\nDid that mean there was a way to get fabrials working in the tower? “As\nyou wish.”\nThen she got to work on the real problem: planning how she was going\nto get them out of this mess.\n* * *\nKaladin was awakened by rain. He blinked, feeling mist on his face and\nseeing a jagged sky lit by spears of lightning frozen in place—not fading,\njust hanging there, framed by black clouds in a constant boil.\nHe stared at the strange sight, then rolled to his side, half submerged in a\npuddle of frigid water. Was this Hearthstone? The warcamps? No …\nneither?\nHe groaned, forcing himself to his feet. He didn’t appear to be wounded,\nbut his head was pounding. No weapons. He felt naked without a spear.\nGusts of rain blew around him, the falling water moving in sheets—and he\nswore he could see the outlines of figures in the rainfall. As if it were\nmaking momentary shapes as it fell.\nThe landscape was dark, evoking distant crags. He started through the\nwater, surprised to see no spren around—not even rainspren. He thought he\nsaw light atop a hill, so he started up the incline, careful not to lose his\nfooting on the slick rock. A part of him wondered why he could see. The\nfrozen jagged lightning bolts didn’t give off much illumination. Hadn’t he\nbeen in a place like this once? With omnipresent light, but a black sky?\nHe stopped and stared upward, rain scouring his face. This was all … all\nwrong. This wasn’t real … was it?\nMotion.\nKaladin spun. A short figure moved down the hill toward him, emerging\nfrom the darkness. It seemed composed entirely of swirling grey mist with\nno features, though it wielded a spear. Kaladin caught the weapon with a\nquick turn of his hand, then twisted and pushed back in a classic disarming\nmove.\nThis phantom attacker wasn’t terribly skilled, and Kaladin easily stole\nthe weapon. Instinct took command, and he spun the spear and rammed it\nthrough the figure’s neck. As the short figure dropped, two more appeared\nas if from nothing, both wielding spears of their own.\nKaladin blocked one strike and threw the attacker off with a calculated\nshove, then spun and dropped the other one with a sweep to the legs. He\nstabbed that figure with a quick thrust to the neck, then easily rammed his\nspear into the stomach of the other one as it stood up. Blood ran down the\nspear’s shaft onto Kaladin’s fingers.\nHe yanked the spear free as the smoky figure dropped. It felt good to\nhold a spear. To be able to fight without worries. Without anything weighing\nhim down other than the rainwater on his uniform. Fighting used to be\nsimple. Before …\nBefore …\nThe swirling mist evaporated off the fallen figures and he found three\nyoung messenger boys in Amaram’s colors, killed by Kaladin’s spear. Three\ncorpses, including his brother."

Three\ncorpses, including his brother.\n“No!” Kaladin screamed, ragged and hateful. “How dare you show me\nthis? It didn’t happen that way! I was there!”\nHe turned away from the corpses, looking toward the sky. “I didn’t kill\nhim! I just failed him. I … I just…”\nHe stumbled away from the dead boys and dropped his spear, hands to\nhis head. He felt the scars on his forehead. They seemed deeper, like\nchasms cutting through his skull.\nShash. Dangerous.\nThunder rumbled overhead and he stumbled downhill, unable to banish\nthe sight of Tien dead and bleeding on the hillside. What kind of terrible\nvision was this?\n“You saved us so we could die,” a voice said from the darkness.\nHe knew that voice. Kaladin spun, splashing in the rainwater, searching\nfor the source. He was on the Shattered Plains now. In the rain he saw the\nsuggestions of people. Figures made by the falling drops, but somehow\nempty.\nThe figures began attacking each other, and he heard the thunder of war.\nMen shouting, weapons clashing, boots on stone. It surrounded him,\noverwhelmed him, until—in a flash—he emerged into an enormous battle,\nthe suggested shapes becoming real. Men in blue fighting against other men\nin blue.\n“Stop fighting!” Kaladin shouted at them. “You’re killing your own!\nThey’re all our soldiers!”\nThey didn’t seem to hear him. Blood flowed beneath his feet instead of\nrainwater, sprays and gushes melding as spearmen climbed eagerly over the\nbodies of the fallen to continue killing one another. Kaladin grabbed one\nspearman and pushed him away from another, then seized a third and pulled\nhim back—only to find that it was Lopen.\n“Lopen!” Kaladin said. “Listen to me! Stop fighting!”\nLopen bared his teeth in a terrible grin, then knocked Kaladin aside\nbefore launching himself at yet another figure—Rock, who had stumbled on\na corpse. Lopen killed him with a spear through the gut, but then Teft killed\nLopen from behind. Bisig stabbed Teft, and Kaladin didn’t see who brought\nhim down. He was too horrified.\nSigzil dropped nearby with a hole in his side, and Kaladin caught him.\n“Why?” Sigzil asked, blood dribbling from his lips. “Why didn’t you let\nus sleep?”\n“This isn’t real. This can’t be real.”\n“You should have let us die on the Shattered Plains.”\n“I wanted to protect you!” Kaladin shouted. “I had to protect you!”\n“You cursed us…”\nKaladin dropped the dying body and stumbled away. He ducked his\nhead, his mind cloudy, and started running. A part of him knew this horror\nwasn’t real, but he could still hear the screaming. Accusing him. Why did\nyou do this, Kaladin? Why have you killed us?\nHe pressed his hands to his ears, so intent on escaping the carnage that\nhe nearly ran straight into a chasm. He pulled up, teetering on the edge. He"

He\nstumbled, then looked to his left. The warcamps were there, up a short\nslope.\nHe’d been here. He remembered this place, this storm, lightly raining.\nThis chasm. Where he’d nearly died.\n“You saved us,” a voice said, “so we could suffer.”\nMoash. He stood on the edge of the chasm near Kaladin. The man\nturned, and Kaladin saw his eyes—black pits. “People think you were\nmerciful to us. But we both know the truth, don’t we? You did it for you.\nNot us. If you were truly merciful, you’d have given us easy deaths.”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “No!”\n“The void awaits, Kal,” Moash said. “The emptiness. It lets you do\nanything—even kill a king—without regret. One step. You’ll never have to\nfeel pain again.”\nMoash took a step and dropped into the chasm. Kaladin fell to his knees\non the edge, rain streaming around him. He stared down in horror.\nThen started awake someplace cold. Immediately, a hundred pains\ncoursed through his joints and muscles, each demanding his attention like a\nscreaming child. He groaned and opened his eyes, but there was only\ndarkness.\nI’m in the tower, he thought, remembering the events of the previous day.\nStorms. The place is controlled by the Fused. I barely got away.\nThe nightmares seemed to be getting worse. Or they’d always been this\nbad, but he didn’t remember. He lay there, breathing deeply, sweating as if\nfrom exertion—and remembered the sight of his friends dying.\nRemembered Moash stepping into that darkness and vanishing.\nSleeping was supposed to refresh you, but Kaladin felt more tired than\nwhen he’d collapsed. He groaned and put his back to the wall, forcing\nhimself to sit up. Then he felt around in a sudden panic. In his addled state,\na part of him thought for sure he’d find Teft dead on the floor.\nHe let out a sigh of relief as he located his friend lying nearby, still\nbreathing. The man had wet himself, unfortunately—he’d grow dehydrated\nquickly if Kaladin didn’t do something, and the potential for rotspren was\nhigh if Kaladin didn’t get him cleaned up and properly situated with a\nbedpan.\nStorms. The weight of what Kaladin had done hung above him, nearly as\noppressive as the weight of the tower. He was alone, lost in the darkness,\nwithout Stormlight or anything to drink—let alone proper weapons. He\nneeded to take care of not only himself, but a man in a coma.\nWhat had he been thinking? He didn’t believe the nightmare—but he\ncouldn’t completely banish its echoes either. Why? Why couldn’t he have\nlet go? Why did he keep fighting? Was it really for them?\nOr was it because he was selfish? Because he couldn’t let go and admit\ndefeat?\n“Syl?” he asked in the darkness. When she didn’t answer him, he called\nagain, his voice trembling. “Syl, where are you?”"

He felt around his enclosure, and realized he had no idea how\nto get out. He’d entombed himself and Teft here in this too-thick darkness.\nTo die slow deaths alone …\nThen a pinprick of light appeared. Syl, blessedly, entered the enclosure.\nShe couldn’t pass through walls—Radiant spren had enough substance in\nthe Physical Realm that they were impeded by most materials. Instead she\nappeared to have come in through some sort of vent high in the wall.\nHer appearance brought with it a measure of his sanity. He released a\nshuddering breath as she flitted down and landed on his outstretched palm.\n“I found a way out,” she said, taking the shape of a soldier wearing a\nscout’s uniform. “I don’t think you’d be able to get through it though. Even\na child would be cramped.\n“I looked around, though I couldn’t go too far. Guards are posted at\nmany stairwells, but they don’t seem to be searching for you. These floors\nare big enough that I think they’ve realized finding one man in here is\nvirtually impossible.”\n“That’s some good news, I guess,” Kaladin said. “Do you have any idea\nwhat that light was that led me in here?”\n“I … have a theory,” Syl said. “A long time ago, before things went\npoorly between spren and humans, there were three Bondsmiths. One for\nthe Stormfather. One for the Nightwatcher. And one other. For a spren\ncalled the Sibling. A spren who remained in this tower, hidden, and did not\nappear to humans. They were supposed to have died long ago.”\n“Huh,” Kaladin said, feeling at the door that had opened to let him in.\n“What were they like?”\n“I don’t know,” Syl said, moving to his shoulder. “We’ve talked to\nBrightness Navani about this, answering her questions, and the other\nRadiant spren didn’t know more than I just said. Remember, many of the\nspren who knew about the old days died—and the Sibling was always\nsecretive. I don’t know what kind of spren they were, or why they could\ncreate a Bondsmith. If they are alive though, I don’t know why so much in\nthe tower doesn’t work.”\n“Well, this wall worked,” Kaladin said, finding the gemstone in the wall.\nThe gem was dark now, but it was also much more prominent on this side.\nHe could easily have missed it from the other direction. How many other\nrooms had such gemstones embedded in the wall, hiding secret doors?\nHe touched the gemstone. Despite the fact that he didn’t have any more\nStormlight, light appeared deep inside it. A white light that twinkled like a\nstar. It expanded into a small burst of Stormlight, and the door silently split\nopen again.\nKaladin let out a long breath and felt a little of his panic wash away. He\nwouldn’t die in the darkness. Once the gemstone was charged, it worked\nlike any other fabrial, continuing to function so long as it had remaining\nStormlight."

Those daunting questions—what he was\ngoing to do about the tower, the dozens of Radiants in enemy captivity, his\nfamily—would need to wait.

Two wouldn’t be able to handle this. Storm it,\nwhere was—\nSigzil and his force of ten Windrunners came swooping back, striking at\nthe underside of the flying platform. It wasn’t truly a flying machine like the\nFourth Bridge, but these platforms were nevertheless an excellent vantage\nfor viewing a battlefield. Assuming they didn’t get attacked.\nDalinar held firm to the railing, glancing at the Mink—who was tethered\nto Dalinar with a rope. The shorter man was grinning wildly as he clung to\nthe railing. Fortunately, the platform soon stopped lurching and the\nSkybreakers scattered, trailed by figures in blue with spears.\nFewer Heavenly Ones than I’d have expected, Dalinar noted as the wind\nruffled his hair. He picked out only four of the flying Fused watching the\nbattlefield from above and occasionally delivering instructions to the\nground troops. They didn’t engage. They’re leaning on the Skybreakers for\nthis battle. Perhaps the bulk of the Heavenly Ones were with the main\nenemy forces, stationed several days’ march away.\nThe Mink leaned out over the side of the platform, trying to get a view\ndirectly beneath—where Radiants were clashing. He didn’t seem at all\nbothered by the three-hundred-yard drop to the ground. For a man who\nalways seemed so paranoid, he could certainly be cavalier regarding danger.\nBeneath them, the battle lines held formation. Dalinar’s troops,\naugmented by ranks of Azish, fought Taravangian’s treasonous forces—\nwho had tried to strike inward to rescue their king. The Vedens were\naccompanied by a small number of Fused and some singer troops, a small\nenough force to have moved in close without detection before the betrayal.\nOn Dalinar’s platform, some fifty archers re-formed their ranks\nfollowing the chaos of the sudden Skybreaker attack. In moments, they\nwere sending a hail of arrows on the Vedens.\n“They’ll break soon,” the Mink said softly, surveying the battlefield.\n“Their line is bowing. Those Azish fight well. Better than I thought they\nwould.”\n“They have excellent discipline,” Dalinar agreed. “They simply needed"

        "text": "“Their line is bowing. Those Azish fight well. Better than I thought they\nwould.”\n“They have excellent discipline,” Dalinar agreed. “They simply needed\nproper direction.” Any given Azish soldier was no match for an Alethi, but\nafter witnessing their discipline this last year, Dalinar was grateful he’d\nnever had to face their infantry in battle. The vast blocks of Azish pikes\nwere less mobile than the Alethi equivalent, but were impeccably\ncoordinated.\nThey were a tremendous addition to an Alethi system, which had far\nmore flexibility and a variety of specialized troops. Using Azish blocks like\nwedges, and Alethi tactics, they’d been able to stand against the enemy\ndespite their natural advantages, like carapace armor and stronger builds.\nAnd the Veden traitors? Well, the Mink was right. The enemy line was\nbeginning to bow and crack. They had no cavalry, and the Mink made a\nquiet order to one of the waiting scribes, who transferred it. Dalinar guessed\n—correctly—he’d ordered a harrying strike of light riders along the left\nflank. Those filled the Veden back rows with arrows, distracting them to\nfurther stress the wavering lines.\n“I do have to admit,” the Mink said to Dalinar as they watched,\nbowstrings snapping behind them, “this is an excellent way to oversee a\nbattlefield.”\n“And you were worried about there being no escape.”\n“Rather,” the Mink said, looking toward the ground below, “I was\nworried about all avenues of escape being interrupted by an unfortunate\ncollision with the ground. Still don’t know the wisdom of putting us both up\nhere; seems like we should be on separate platforms, so that if one falls, the\nother can continue to lead our forces.”\n“You mistake my purpose, Dieno,” Dalinar said, tugging on the rope that\nbound them. “My job in this battle isn’t to command if you are killed. It’s to\nget you out before you are killed.”\nOne of Jasnah’s escape boats waited on the other side, in Shadesmar. In\nan emergency, Dalinar could get himself and the Mink through the\nperpendicularity. They’d drop a short distance—but not nearly as far as they\nwould on this side—into a padded ship with mandras hooked in place.\nThe Mink, unsurprisingly, didn’t like that escape route. He couldn’t\ncontrol it. In truth, Dalinar wasn’t a hundred percent comfortable with it\nhimself—he didn’t fully trust his powers yet. His mastery over them was\ntenuous.\nHe opened the perpendicularity as the Windrunners approached for more\nStormlight. He managed to open it only a sliver, renewing those nearby, but\npreventing the Skybreakers from partaking. They retreated; Skybreakers\ncouldn’t match Windrunners who were being constantly renewed, and were\nusually deployed on battlefields where Dalinar was not present.\nAs the Mink took casualty reports—which included two Windrunner\nsquires, unfortunately—a young scribe stepped up to Dalinar with a sheaf\nof papers and a blinking spanreed. “Word from Urithiru, Brightlord,” she\nsaid. “You wanted to know as soon as we heard something, and we have.”\nDalinar felt a huge weight slide off his shoulders. “Finally!

It also interferes with fabrials.\nShe had to send a scouting team out along the ridge into the mountains\nbefore they were able to deliver her message.\n“Everyone is safe, and she’s working on the problem. That is why the\nOathgates have stopped working, however. She begs for your patience, and\nasks if anything strange has happened here.”\n“Tell her about Taravangian’s betrayal,” Dalinar said, “but report that\nI’m safe, as is our family. We are fighting the traitors, and should soon win\nthe day.”\nShe nodded and went to send the message. The Mink stepped closer;\nhe’d either overheard, or had received a similar report.\n“They’re trying to confuse and distract us during the betrayal,” he said.\n“Heaping attacks on multiple fronts.”\n“Another ploy to negate the Oathgates,” Dalinar agreed. “That device\nthey used on Highmarshal Kaladin must have been some sort of test.\nThey’ve knocked out Urithiru for a while to isolate us.”\nThe Mink leaned out, squinting at the armies below. “Something about\nthis smells wrong, Blackthorn. If this was merely a ploy to isolate the\nfighting in Azir and Emul, they’ve made a tactical mistake. Their forces in\nthis part of the land are exposed, and we have the upper hand. They\nwouldn’t go through so much effort to block us from the Oathgates unless it\nwere truly cutting off our escape route. Which it won’t because we’re not\ngoing to need one.”\n“You think this is a distraction from something else?”\nThe Mink nodded slowly. Far below, the cavalry did another sweep. The\nline of the traitors buckled further.\n“I’ll tell the others to watch out,” Dalinar said, “and send scouts to\ninvestigate Urithiru. I agree, something about this is off.”\n“Make certain the armies we’re going to fight in Emul haven’t been\nsecretly reinforced. That could be terrible for us—the only true disaster I\ncan envision here is Azimir being besieged, and unable to be resupplied via\nthe Oathgates. Having seen that city, I’d hate to be trapped there.”\n“Agreed,” Dalinar said.\nThe Mink leaned out further, precariously, as he watched the battlefield\nbelow. It was hard to hear—muffled clangs, shouts from far away. Men\nmoved like lifespren.\nBut Dalinar could smell the sweat. Could hear the roar. Could feel\nhimself standing among the struggling, screaming, dying bodies and\ndominating with Blade in hand. Once you’d tasted the near invincibility of\nwearing Plate and wading in among mortals, it was a … difficult flavor to\nforget.\n“You miss it,” the Mink said, eyeing him.\n“Yes,” Dalinar admitted.\n“They could use you on the ground.”\n“Down there, I’d be merely another sword.

We’re missing a piece of the enemy’s plan.\nAs he was watching, a nondescript soldier stepped up beside him.\nDalinar had brought only a handful of bodyguards today: three men from\nthe Cobalt Guard, and a single Shardbearer. Cord, the Horneater woman,\nwho had taken it upon herself to join his guards for reasons he didn’t quite\nunderstand.\nHe also held a hidden weapon—the man who stood beside him, so\nordinary in his Alethi uniform, holding a sheathed sword that was\nadmittedly longer than regulation. Szeth, the Assassin in White, wearing a\nfalse face. He didn’t speak, though the complex Lightweaving he wore\nwould disguise his voice. He simply watched, his eyes narrowed. What did\nhe see in this battlefield? What had caught his attention?\nSzeth suddenly grabbed Dalinar by the front of his uniform and towed\nhim to the side. Dalinar barely had time to shout in surprise as a glowing\nfigure rose up beside the archer platform, radiant with Stormlight and\nbearing a silvery Blade. Szeth stepped between Dalinar and the Skybreaker,\nhand going to his sword. But Dalinar caught him by the arm, preventing\nhim from drawing it. Once that weapon came out, dangerous things\nhappened. They would want to be absolutely certain it was needed before\nunleashing it.\nThe figure was familiar to Dalinar. Dark brown skin, with a birthmark on\nhis cheek. Nalan—called Nale. Herald and leader of the Skybreakers. He\nhad shaved his head recently, and held out his Blade in a defiant—perhaps\nchallenging—posture as he addressed Dalinar.\n“Bondsmith,” Nale said, “your war is unjust. You must submit to the\nlaws of the—”"

You must submit to the\nlaws of the—”\nAn arrow slammed into his face, dead center, interrupting him. Dalinar\nglanced back, then stopped Cord, who was drawing her Shardbow again.\n“Wait. I’d hear him.”\nNale, with a suffering expression, pulled the arrow free and dropped it,\nletting his Stormlight heal him. Could this man be killed? Ash said the\nenemy had somehow killed Jezrien—but before, when Heralds died, their\nsouls had returned to Damnation to await torture.\nNale didn’t continue his diatribe. He lightly stepped up onto the railing\nof the platform, then dropped to the deck. He tossed his Blade away, letting\nit vanish to mist in midair.\n“How are you a Bondsmith?” Nale asked Dalinar. “You should not exist,\nBlackthorn. Your cause is not righteous. You should be denied the true\nSurges of Honor.”\n“Perhaps it is a sign that you are wrong, Nalan,” Dalinar said. “Perhaps\nour cause is righteous.”\n“No,” Nale said. “Other Radiants can lie to themselves and their spren.\nSo-called honorspren prove that morality is shaped by their perceptions.\nYou should be different. Honor should not allow this bonding.”\n“Honor is dead,” Dalinar said.\n“And yet,” Nale said, “Honor still should prevent this. Prevent you.” He\nlooked Dalinar up and down. “No Shardblade. Fair enough.”\nHe launched forward, reaching for Dalinar. Szeth was upon him in a\nmoment, but hesitated to draw his strange Blade. Nale moved with a\nskyeel’s grace, twisting Szeth about and slamming him to the deck of the\nwooden platform. The Herald slapped aside Szeth’s sheathed sword,\npunching him in the crook of the elbow and making him drop his weapon.\nNale casually reached up and caught the arrow launched from Cord’s\nShardbow mere feet away—an inhuman feat.\nDalinar pressed his hands together, reaching beyond reality for the\nperpendicularity. Nale leaped over Szeth toward Dalinar as the others on the\nplatform shouted, trying to react to the attack.\nNo, the Stormfather said to Dalinar. Touch him.\nDalinar hesitated—the power of the perpendicularity at his fingertips—\nthen reached out and pressed his hand to Nale’s chest as the Herald reached\nfor him.\nFlash.\nDalinar saw Nale stepping away from a discarded Blade rammed into the\nstone.\nFlash.\nNale cradling a child in one arm, his Blade out as dark forces crawled\nacross a ridge nearby.\nFlash.\nNale standing with a group of scholars and unrolling a large writ, filled\nwith writing. “The law cannot be moral,” Nale said to them. “But you can\nbe moral as you create laws. Ever must you protect the weakest, those most\nlikely to be taken advantage of. Institute a right of movement, so that a\nfamily who feels their lord is unrighteous can leave his area. Then tie a\nlord’s authority to the people who follow him.”\nFlash.\nNale kneeling before a highspren.\nFlash.\nNale fighting on a battlefield.\nFlash."

Until\nFlash.\nNale clasping hands with a bearded Alethi man, regal and wise. Dalinar\nknew this was Jezerezeh, though he couldn’t say how.\n“I will take this charge,” Nale said softly. “With honor.”\n“Do not consider it an honor,” Jezerezeh said. “A duty, yes, but not an\nhonor.”\n“I understand. Though I had not expected you would come to an enemy\nwith this offer.”\n“An enemy, yes,” Jezerezeh said. “But an enemy who was correct all\nalong, making me the villain, not you. We will fix what we’ve broken. Ishar\nand I agreed. There is no person we would welcome more eagerly into this\npact than you. You are the single most honorable man I have ever had the\nprivilege of opposing.”\n“I wish that were true,” Nale said. “But I will serve as best I can.”\nThe vision faded and Nale lurched away from Dalinar, gasping, his eyes\nwide. He left a line of light stretching between him and Dalinar.\nBondsmith, the Stormfather said in Dalinar’s mind. You forged a brief\nConnection with him. What did you see?\n“His past, I think,” Dalinar whispered. “And now…”\nNale scratched at his head, and Dalinar saw a skeletal figure overlapping\nhim. Like the echo of light that followed Szeth, only worn, dim. Dalinar\nstepped forward, walking among his stunned bodyguards, noting eight lines\nof light extending from Nale into the distance.\n“I see the Oathpact, I think,” Dalinar said. “The thing that bound them\ntogether and made them capable of holding the enemy in Damnation.”\nA cage, forged of their spirits, the Stormfather said in his mind. It was\nbroken. Even before Jezrien’s death, they shattered it by what they did long\nago.\n“No, only one line of it is completely broken. The rest are there, but\nweak, impotent.” Dalinar pointed to one line, bright and powerful. “Except\none. Still vibrant.”\nNale looked up at him, then ripped free of the line of light Connecting\nhim to Dalinar and threw himself off the platform. The Herald burst alight\nand shot away as—belatedly—a few Windrunners came to Dalinar’s aid.\nYou wield the power of gods, Dalinar, the Stormfather said. I once\nthought I knew the extent of your abilities. I have abandoned that ignorant\nsupposition.\n“Could I reforge it?” Dalinar asked. “Could I remake the Oathpact, and\nbind the Fused away again?”\nI do not know. It may be possible, but I have no idea how. Or if it would\nbe wise. The Heralds suffer for what they did.\n“I saw that in him,” Dalinar said, watching as Nale vanished in the\ndistance. “He is burdened with a terrible pain that warps how he sees\nreality.

All the while, he was lost in\nthought.\nHe needed to understand his powers. His duty was no longer to stand\nwith a sword held high, shouting orders on the battlefield. He instead\nneeded to find a way to use his abilities to solve this war. Reforge the\nOathpact, or barring that, find another solution—one that included binding\nOdium once and for all.\nNINE YEARS AGO\nThere was more than one way to explore. It turned out you could do it from\nthe center of your own tent, if a group of living relics walked out of the\nforest and came to visit.\nThe humans thrilled Eshonai. They hadn’t been destroyed after all. And\ntheir ways were so strange. They spoke without rhythm, and couldn’t hear\nthe songs of Roshar. They made carapace out of metal and tied it to\nthemselves. Though she first assumed they had lost their forms, she soon\nrealized that they had only a single form, and could never change. They had\nto deal with the passions of mateform all the time.\nMore intriguing, they brought with them a tribe of dullform creatures\nwho also had no songs. They had skin patterns like the listeners, but didn’t\ntalk, let alone sing. Eshonai found them fascinating and disturbing. Where\nhad the humans found such strange individuals?\nThe humans made camp across the river in the forest, and at first the\nFive let only a few listeners come to meet them. They worried about\nfrightening away the strange humans if the entire family came to bother\nthem.\nEshonai thought this foolish. The humans wouldn’t grow frightened.\nThey knew ancient things. Methods of forging metal and of writing sounds\non paper. Things that the listeners had forgotten during the long sleep, the\ntime they’d spent wearing dullform, memorizing songs by sheer force of\nwill.\nEshonai, Klade, and a few others joined a few human scholars, trying to\ndecipher one another’s tongues. Preserved in the songs, fortunately, were\nhuman phrases. Perhaps her past with the songs was what helped Eshonai\nlearn faster than the others. Or maybe it was her stubbornness. She spent\nevenings sitting with the humans, making them repeat sounds over and over\nlate into the night by the light of their brilliant glowing gemstones.\nThat was another thing. Human gemstones glowed far more brightly\nthan listener ones. It had to do with the way the gemstones were cut and\nshaped. Each day with the humans taught her something new.\nOnce the language barrier began to fall, the humans asked if they could\nbe taken out onto the Shattered Plains. So it was that Eshonai led the way,\nthough she kept them far from the ten ancient cities and the other listener\nfamilies, for now.\nUsing one of Eshonai’s maps, they approached from the north and"

The\nrift in the stone smelled of wet rotting plants. Pungent, but not unpleasant.\nWhere plants rotted, others often soon grew, and the scent of death was the\nsame as the scent of life.\nThe humans followed gingerly across the bridge of wood and rope, the\nguards going first—wearing their buffed metal carapace breastplates and\ncaps. They seemed to expect the bridge to collapse at any moment.\nOnce across, Eshonai stepped up onto a boulder and took a deep breath,\nfeeling the winds. Overhead, a few windspren swirled in the sky. Once the\nguards had crossed, some of the others started over as well. Everyone had\nwanted to come see the Plains where the monsters of the chasms lived.\nOne of the attendants was a curious woman who was the surgeon’s\nassistant. She climbed up onto the rock beside Eshonai, though her clothing\n—which enveloped her from neck to ankles and covered up her left hand\nfor some reason—wasn’t particularly good for exploring. It was nice to see\nthat there were some things that the listeners had figured out that the\nhumans hadn’t.\n“What do you see?” she asked Eshonai in the human tongue. “When you\nlook at the spren?”\nEshonai hummed to Consideration. What did she mean? “I see spren,”\nEshonai said, speaking slowly and deliberately, as her accent was\nsometimes bad.\n“Yes, what do they look like?”\n“Long white lines,” Eshonai said, pointing at the windspren. “Holes.\nSmall holes? Is there a word?”\n“Pinpricks, perhaps.”\n“Pinpricks in sky,” Eshonai said. “And tails, long, very long.”\n“Curious,” the woman said. She wore a lot of rings on her right hand,\nthough Eshonai couldn’t tell why. It seemed like they would get caught on\nthings. “It is different.”\n“Different?” Eshonai said. “We see different?”\n“Yes,” the woman said. “You seem to see the reality of the spren, or\ncloser to it. Tell me. We have stories, among the humans, of windspren that\nact like people. Taking different shapes, playing tricks. Have you ever seen\none like that?”\nEshonai went over the words in her mind. She thought she understood\nsome of it. “Spren like people? Act like people?”\n“Yes.”\n“I have seen this,” she said.\n“Excellent. And windspren that talk? That call you by name? Have you\nmet any like this?”\n“What?” Eshonai said, attuning Amusement. “Spren talking? No. It\nseems … not real? Fake, but a story?”\n“‘Fanciful’ is perhaps the word you want.”\n“Fanciful,” Eshonai said, examining the sounds in her mind. Yes, there\nwas more than one way to explore.\nThe king and his brother finally crossed onto the plateau. “King” was not"

Yes, there\nwas more than one way to explore.\nThe king and his brother finally crossed onto the plateau. “King” was not\na new word to her, as it was mentioned in the songs. There had been debate\namong the listeners whether they should have a monarch. It seemed to\nEshonai that until they managed to stop squabbling and became a single\nunified people, the discussion was silly.\nThe king’s brother was a brutish man who seemed like a slightly\ndifferent breed from everyone else. He was the first she’d met, along with a\ngroup of human scouts, back in the forest. This human wasn’t simply larger\nthan most of the others, he walked with a different step. His face was\nharder. If a human could ever be said to have a form, this man was\nwarform.\nThe king himself though … he was proof that humans didn’t have forms.\nHe was so erratic. Sometimes loud and angry, other times quiet and\ndismissive. Listeners had different emotions too, of course. It was just that\nthis man seemed to defy explanation. Perhaps the fact that the humans\nspoke with no rhythms made her more surprised when they acted with such\npassion. He was also the only male in the group who wore a beard. Why\nwas that?\n“Guide,” the king said, walking up to her. “Is this where the hunts\nhappen?”\n“Sometimes,” she said. “Depends. It is season, so maybe they come.\nMaybe not.”\nThe king nodded absently. He had taken little interest in her or any of the\nlisteners. His scouts and scholars, however, seemed as fascinated by\nEshonai as she was with them. So she tended to spend time with them.\n“What kinds of greatshells can live here?” the brother asked. “There\ndoesn’t seem to be space for them, with all these cracks in the ground. Are\nthey like whitespines? Jumping from place to place?”\n“Whitespine?” she said, not knowing the word.\nThe woman with the rings brought out a book with a drawing in it for\nher.\nEshonai shook her head. “No, not that. They are…” How to explain the\nmonsters of the chasms? “They are great. And large. And powerful. They …\nthese lands are theirs.”\n“And do your people worship them?” one of the scholars asked.\n“Worship?”\n“Reverence. Respect.”\n“Yes.” Who wouldn’t respect a beast so mighty?\n“Their gods, Brightlord,” said the scribe to the king. “As I suspected,\nthey worship these beasts. We must take care with future hunts.”\nEshonai hummed to Anxiety, to indicate she was confused—but they\ndidn’t recognize this. They had to say everything with words.\n“Here,” the king said, pointing. “This plateau seems a good enough place\nfor a break.”\nThe human attendants began unpacking their things—tents made of a\nmarvelous tough cloth, and a variety of foods. They enjoyed their lunches,\nthese humans. Their traveling luxury was so opulent, it made Eshonai\nwonder what their homes were like.\nOnce they left, she intended to see.

If they’d made it here without a\nproperly durable form such as workform, then they must not have come that\nfar. She attuned Amusement. After all these years with no contact, she likely\nwould have found her way to their home on her own, given a few more\nmonths.\nEshonai kept busy by helping erect the tents. She wanted to figure out\nthe pieces. She was fairly certain she could carve poles like the ones used\nfor holding up the roof. But the cloth was lighter, smoother, than what the\nlisteners could create. One of the workers was having trouble with a knot,\nso Eshonai took out her knife to cut it free.\n“What is that?” a voice said from behind her. “Do you mind showing me\nthat knife?”\nIt was the woman with the rings. Eshonai had thought she might be\nonce-mates with the king, considering how often she spoke with him. But\napparently there was no relation.\nEshonai glanced down, realizing that she’d brought out her good hunting\nknife. It was one of the weapons her ancestors had salvaged from the ruins\nat the center of the Plains, with beautiful metal that had lines in it, and a\ncarved hilt of majestic detail.\nShe shrugged and showed it to the woman. The strange woman, in turn,\nwaved urgently to the king. He left the shade and stepped over, taking the\nknife and narrowing his eyes as he studied it.\n“Where did you get this?” he asked Eshonai.\n“It is old,” she said, not wanting to say too much. “Handed down.\nGenerations.”\n“Lasting back to the False Desolation, perhaps?” the woman asked the\nking. “Could they really have weapons two thousand years old?”\nThe listener Shardblades were far more marvelous, but Eshonai didn’t\nspeak of those. Her family didn’t own any anyway.\n“I would like to know,” the king said, “how you—”\nHe was interrupted by a trumping in the near distance. Eshonai spun,\nattuning Tension. “Monster of Chasms,” she said. “Get soldiers! I did not\nthink one would come close.”\n“We can handle a…” the king began, but trailed off, and his eyes became\nwide. An awespren approached—a floating blue ball of a creature that\nexpanded with great enthusiasm.\nEshonai turned and saw a distant shadow emerging from a chasm. Sleek\nyet strong, powerful yet graceful. The beast walked on numerous legs, and\ndidn’t bestow the humans with a glance. They were to it as it was to the sun\n—indeed, it turned upward at the light to bask. Gorgeous and mighty, as if\nthe Rhythm of Awe had been given life.\n“Blood of my fathers…” the king’s brother said, stepping up. “How big\nis that thing?”\n“Bigger than any we have in Alethkar,” the king said. “You’d have to\nmake your way to the Herdazian coast to come across a greatshell so large.\nBut those live in the waters.”\n“These live in chasms,” Eshonai whispered. “It doesn’t seem angry,"

Finally, the\nchasmfiend turned and looked them over. Then it slunk down into the\nchasm, trailed by a few shimmering chasmspren, like arrows in flight.\n“Storms,” the king’s brother said. “You mean at any time, standing on\nthese plateaus, one of those might be right below? Prowling about?”\n“How can they live in those chasms?” one of the women asked. “What\ndo they eat?”\nIt was a more solemn and quick group that returned to their lunch. They\nwere eager to finish and leave, but none of them said it, and none hummed\nto Anxiety.\nOf them all, only the king seemed unperturbed. While the others busied\nthemselves, he continued studying Eshonai’s knife, which he hadn’t\nreturned to her.\n“You truly kept these for thousands of years?” he asked.\n“No,” she admitted. “We found them. Not my parents. Their parents’\nparents. In the ruins.”\n“Ruins, you say?” he looked up sharply. “What ruins? Those cities the\nother guide mentioned?”\nEshonai cursed Klade softly for having mentioned the ten cities.\nDeciding not to clarify that she meant the ruins at the center of the Plains,\nshe attuned Anxiety. The way he inspected her made her feel like she was a\nmap that had been drawn wrong. “My people built cities,” she said. “Old\nparents of my people.”\n“You don’t say…” he said. “Very curious. You remember those days\nthen? You have records of them?”\n“We have songs,” she said. “Many songs. Important songs. They talk of\nthe forms we bore. The wars we fought. How we left the … I don’t know\nthe word … the ones of old. Who ruled us. When the Neshua Kadal were\nfighting, with spren as companions, and had … had things … they could\ndo…”\n“Radiants?” he said, his voice growing softer. “Your people have stories\nabout the Knights Radiant?”\n“Yes, maybe?” she said. “I can’t words, yet. Of this.”\n“Curious, curious.”\nAs she’d expected, the humans decided to return to the forest soon after\ntheir meal. They were frightened—all but the king. He spent the entire trip\nasking about the songs. She had plainly been mistaken when she’d assumed\nhe didn’t care much about the listeners.\nFor from that moment on, he seemed very, very interested. He had his\nscholars interrogate them about songs, lore, and whether they knew of any\nother ruins. When the humans finally left for their lands several days later,\nKing Gavilar gave Eshonai’s people a gift: several crates of modern\nweapons, made of fine steel.

No family had enough to outfit\nall their warriors.\nAll Gavilar wanted in exchange was a promise: that when he returned in\nthe near future, he wanted to find Eshonai’s people housed in one of the\ncities at the edge of the Plains. At that time, he said, he hoped to be able to\nhear from the keepers of songs in person.\nIn my fevered state, I worry I’m unable to focus on what is important.\n—From Rhythm of War, page 3\nNavani set to work organizing her scholars under the careful supervision of\na large number of singer guards.\nThe situation left Navani with a delicate problem. She didn’t want to\ngive away more than was absolutely necessary. But if she failed to make\nprogress, Raboniel would eventually notice and take action.\nFor now, Navani set the scholars to doing some busywork. The singers\nkept her people enclosed in a single one of the two library rooms, so Navani\nhad the wards and younger ardents begin cleaning the room. They gathered\nup old projects and boxes of notes, then carried them out to stack in the\nhallway. They needed to make space.\nShe assigned the more experienced scholars to do revision work: going\nback over projects and either checking calculations or drawing new\nsketches. Ardents brought out fresh ledgers to go over figures, while Rushu\nunrolled large schematics and set several younger women to measuring\neach and every line. This would take up several days, perhaps longer—and\nit was also quite a natural thing to do. Navani frequently ordered\nrecalculations after an interruption. It restored the scholars to a proper\nmindset, and they sometimes found legitimate errors.\nSoon enough, she had an orderly room full of calming sounds. Papers\nshuffling, pens writing, people quietly discussing. No creationspren or\nlogicspren, as often attended exciting work. Hopefully the singers in the\nroom wouldn’t realize that was odd.\nThose singers were always underfoot, lingering close enough to overhear\nwhat Navani told her people. She’d grown accustomed to a clean\nworkspace—giving her people enough freedom to innovate, but also\nenough careful corralling to keep them innovating in the proper direction.\nAll of these guards undermined that effort, and Navani often caught her\nscholars glancing up and staring at some armed brute standing nearby.\nAt least most were merely common soldiers. Only one Fused—other\nthan Raboniel—stayed near the scholars, and she wasn’t one of those\nunnerving ones who could meld with the rock. No, this was a Fused of\nRaboniel’s same type, a tall Fused with a topknot and a long face marbled\nwhite and red. The femalen sat on the floor, watching them, her eyes glazed\nover.\nNavani kept covert watch over this Fused during the morning work. She\nhad been told that many Fused were unhinged, and this one seemed to fit\nthat description. She often stared off into nothingness, then giggled to\nherself. She would let her head flop from one side to the other. Why would\nRaboniel put this one here to watch them? Were there possibly so few sane\nFused left that there was no other choice?"

We’ll need to talk\nhere. You can hear me if I speak very softly like this?”\nYes.\n“Can you see what Raboniel is doing?”\nShe had some workers set up a desk near the shield, where she is doing\ntests upon it to see if she can get through.\n“Can she?”\nI don’t know. This is the first time it has been deployed. But she doesn’t\nseem to realize you were the one who activated it. She explained to several\nothers that she must have triggered some unknown fail-safe left by the\nancient Radiants. She thinks that I must be dead after all this time, since the\ntower doesn’t work.\n“Curious,” Navani said. “Why would she think that?”\nThe Midnight Mother told her. That Unmade who infected me for so\nmany years, the one your Radiants frightened away? I remained hidden\nfrom her all that time, never fighting back, and so she thinks I died.\n“All that time?” Navani asked. “How long?”\nCenturies.\n“Wasn’t that hard?”\nNo. Why? Centuries mean nothing to me. I do not age.\n“Other spren act like time has meaning.”\nRadiant spren, yes. Radiant spren put on a show, pretending as if they\nare male or female, malen or femalen, when they are neither. They think like\nhumans because they want to be like humans.\nI do not pretend. I am not human. I do not need to care about time. I do\nnot need to look like you. I do not need to beg for your attention.\nNavani cocked an eyebrow at that, considering that the Sibling had\nneeded to beg for her help. She held her tongue. How to best use this\nadvantage? What was the path to freedom? Navani liked to think that she\ncould see patterns, that she could make order from chaos. There was a way\nout of this mess. She had to believe that.\nTreat it like any other problem, Navani thought to herself. Approach it\nsystematically, breaking it down into manageable pieces.\nLast night, she’d decided on a few general courses of action. First, she\nhad to maintain the ground she’d already obtained. That meant making\ncertain the Sibling’s shield remained in place.\nSecond, she had to get word to Dalinar and those on the outside,\napprising them of what had happened.\nThird, Navani needed to figure out what the enemy had done to negate\nRadiant powers.

Navani needed to deactivate it.\nFinally, she needed to turn that power upon the invaders. Barring that,\nshe needed to use the awakened Radiants to mount a counterattack.\nStanding here, trapped in the basement and constantly watched, those\nseemed impossible tasks. But her scholars had made a ship fly. She could do\nthis, with their help.\nNavani counted off the singer guards as they strolled through the room,\nlooking over the shoulders of working scholars. One stopped the girls\ncarrying out notes and checked through the boxes. That one Fused—the one\nwho kept moving her head from one side to the other, humming a loud\nrhythm—was watching Navani at the moment. Navani tried not to let that\nunnerve her, and turned her head so her lips wouldn’t be visible, then\ncontinued talking under her breath.\n“Let’s assume,” she said, “that Raboniel is smart enough to figure out\nwhat those ancient Radiants did in creating this shield for you. What would\nbe the best way for her to go about circumventing it?”\nThe Sibling didn’t respond, and Navani began to worry. “Has something\nhappened? Are you well?”\nI am fine, the Sibling said. But we are not friends, human. You are a\nslaver. I do not trust you.\n“You’ve trusted me so far.”\nOut of necessity. I am safe now.\n“And for how long will you be safe? You’re saying there is no way for\nRaboniel to get through?”\nThe Sibling didn’t respond.\n“Fine,” Navani said. “But I can’t plan a way to help you if I don’t know\nyour weaknesses. You’ll be alone, subject to whatever Raboniel decides to\ndo.”\n… I hate humans, the Sibling eventually said. Humans twist what is said\nand always make themselves out to be right.\nHow long until you demand that I bond a human, give up my freedom,\nand risk my life? I’m sure you’ll have wonderful explanations as to why I\nshould absolutely do that.\nThis time Navani was the one who remained silent. The Sibling could\ncreate another Bondsmith, and considering how useful Dalinar’s powers\nwere to the war effort, Navani would be foolish not to seize the opportunity.\nSo she would need to find a way to make the Sibling bond a human again.\nShe’d have to find someone completely unthreatening. Someone who didn’t\nwork with fabrials, someone who wasn’t a politician. Someone the Sibling\nwould like.\nFor now, Navani didn’t prod. The Sibling clearly had some strange ways,\nbut their interactions so far had been quite human, despite what they\nclaimed. And Navani would expect a human to …\nThe shield we created is something Raboniel might have heard about, the\nSibling said at last. Therefore, she might understand how to circumvent it.\n“Tell me more,” Navani said.\nThe shield is an extrapolation of the Surge of Soulcasting. It solidifies the\nair in a region by persuading it that it is glass. For the shield to be\nmaintained, the system needs to be fed by external sources of Stormlight.\nRaboniel might realize this—especially if she researches the remnants of the"

There were four. You destroyed one. If she finds one of the other\nthree, she could use it to corrupt me from the outside.\n“So we need to find them first,” Navani said, “and destroy them.”\nNo. NO! That will weaken the shield, then destroy it. We need to defend\nthem. Breaking one was bad enough. Do not think because I gave you\npermission once, you can continue to do this. Humans always break things.\nNavani took a deep breath. She had to speak very carefully. “I won’t\nbreak any of them unless it’s absolutely necessary. Let’s talk about\nsomething else. How did you contact me earlier? Can you work a\nspanreed?”\nI hate the things. But using one was necessary.\n“Yes, but how? Do you have hands somewhere?”\nJust helpers. There is an insane woman, locked in a monastery, who I\ncontacted. Those isolated, those with permeable souls, respond better to\nspren sometimes. This one, however, only wrote down everything I said—\nnever responding. I had Dabbid bring her a spanreed, and I communicated\nthrough her.\nDrat. That didn’t seem particularly useful, at least now that spanreeds\nweren’t working. “How is it that the enemy knocked the Radiants\nunconscious?” Navani asked.\nIt is an aspect of Ur, the Tower, the Sibling said. A defense set up to\nprevent the Fused—and the Unmade, depending on circumstances—from\nentering it.\n“I encountered a fabrial designed to do the same—one I think must have\nbeen modeled after part of the crystal pillar. I don’t mean to be rude, but did\nyou not consider activating this defense when they attacked?”\nThe Sibling fell silent for a time, and Navani wondered if she had pushed\nthe spren too far. Fortunately they spoke again, softly. I have … been\nwounded. Thousands of years ago, something happened that changed the\nsingers. It hurt me too.\nNavani covered her shock. “You’re speaking of the binding of that\nUnmade, which made the singers lose their forms?”\nYes. That terrible act touched the souls of all who belong to Roshar.\nSpren too.\n“How have no spren mentioned this?”\nI don’t know. But I lost the rhythm of my Light that day. The tower\nstopped working. My father, Honor, should have been able to help me, but\nhe was losing his mind. And he soon died …\nThere was enough sorrow in the Sibling’s voice that Navani didn’t push\nthem for answers. This changed everything.\nWhen that Fused touched me, the Sibling continued, she corrupted part\nof me to the tone of Odium. This wouldn’t have been possible, once—but it\nis now. She fills my system with his Light, ruining me. Corrupting me.\n“So…” Navani said. “If we could find a way to destroy the Voidlight\ninside you, or somehow recover the rhythm you lost, you could reactivate\nthe tower to our defense?”\nI suppose. It doesn’t seem possible. I feel … like we’re doomed."

I feel … like we’re doomed.\nThe mood shift seemed familiarly human. Indeed, Navani felt a little of\nthe same. She rested her head against the wall, closing her eyes.\nBreak it down into little pieces, she reminded herself. Protect the Sibling\nlong enough to figure out the other problems. That’s your first task.\nYou didn’t fill out a map all at once. You did it one line at a time. That\nwas the soul of discovery.\nBut … the Sibling said.\n“But?” Navani said, opening her eyes. “But what?”\nBut we might not need to wake up any Radiants. There are two in the\ntower who are still awake.\nAgain Navani nearly broke her calm facade. Why hadn’t the Sibling\nmentioned this immediately? “How?”\nOne makes sense to me, the Sibling said. She is awake because she was\ncreated oddly, to use Light differently from others. She was made by my\nmother for this purpose. But I have lost track of her, and I do not know\nwhere she is. A young woman. Edgedancer.\n“Lift,” Navani said. That one always had been strange. “You can’t see\nher anymore?”\nNo. I think one reason I can see parts of the tower has to do with\nRadiants, who are Connected to me. I caught glimmers of this Edgedancer\ngirl for a while, but she vanished yesterday. She was in a cage, and I\nsuspect they surrounded her with ralkalest.\nBut there is one other. A man. He must be of the Fourth Ideal, but he has\nno armor. So … maybe of the Third, but close to the Fourth? Perhaps it is\nsomething about his closeness to my father—and his closeness to the Surge\nof Adhesion—that keeps him conscious. His power is that of bonds. This\nman is a Windrunner, but no longer wears a uniform.\nKaladin. “Can you contact him?”\n* * *\nKaladin’s first goal was Stormlight. Fortunately, he knew exactly where to\nfind some infused spheres. Workers frequently erected gemstone lanterns in\nbusier corridors, pushing away the darkness and making the interior more\nwelcoming and comfortable. One such project had been happening on the\nsixth floor, far enough from his family’s clinic that he felt it wasn’t too\ndangerous to try approaching.\nHe started by feeling his way through the darkened hallways near his\nhiding place on the eleventh floor. Together with Syl, he made a mental map\nof the area, then inched to the perimeter. Kaladin felt like he was leaving a\nslaver’s cage when he saw that first glimmer of sunlight in the distance, and\nhad to keep himself from running all-out to reach it.\nSlow, steady, careful. He let Syl explore on ahead. She snuck up to the\nbalcony, then peeked out. Kaladin crouched in the darkness waiting,\nwatching, listening.

He tried to memorize the strata here in this\noutermost hallway, then glanced over his shoulder back into the bowels of\nthe eleventh floor. That corridor was basically a straight shot to his hiding\nplace. His stupid brain imagined forgetting the way and leaving Teft to die,\nwasting away, perhaps waking at the end. Alone, trapped, terrified …\nKaladin shook his head, then inched out into a balcony room where he\ncould survey the exterior of the tower. They hadn’t seen a single guard\nwhile walking here. Glancing out, he didn’t see a single Heavenly One\nflying. What was happening? Had they retreated for some reason?\nNo. He still felt the oppressive dullness, the sign of whatever they’d\ndone to suppress the Radiants. Kaladin leaned out farther. On the plateaus,\nhe saw figures in blue uniforms guarding the Oathgates in their usual\nlocations. He felt a spike of relief, and even disbelief. Had it all been some\nterrible nightmare?\n“Kaladin!” Syl hissed. “Someone’s coming.”\nThe two of them pressed their backs to the nearby wall as a group of\nfigures passed through the hallway outside. They were speaking to the\nrhythms, in Azish. Singer guards—Kaladin caught a glimpse of them\ncarrying spears. He almost jumped them, but restrained himself. There\nwould be an easier and less blatant way of getting a proper weapon.\nThe enemy was clearly still in control. And as he considered it, the truth\noccurred to him.\n“They’re making the outside of the tower look like nothing has\nhappened,” he whispered to Syl after the patrol had passed. “They know\nDalinar will send Windrunners to scout the tower once communication fails,\nso the enemy is trying to pretend the place hasn’t been conquered. Those\nare either Fused illusions, or human sympathizers—perhaps the remnants of\nAmaram’s army—wearing stolen uniforms.”\n“And Windrunners won’t be able to get close enough to discover the\ntruth, lest their powers fail,” Syl said.\n“That part will be suspicious,” Kaladin said. “The enemy can’t keep this\ngoing for long.”\nThe two moved to a nearby stairwell. It didn’t seem to be guarded, but\nhe sent Syl ahead to check anyway. Then they started down, finding the\ntenth, ninth, and eighth floors relatively unguarded. There was simply too\nmuch space up here to watch it all. Though they did spot one other patrol at\nthe tower’s perimeter, it was easy going until they reached the seventh floor.\nHere, leading down to the more populated sixth floor, they found guards at\nthe bottom of the first five stairwells they tried.\nThey had to move inward and find a small out-of-the-way stairwell that\nSyl remembered. Reaching it meant entering the darkness again. To\nKaladin, sunlight was as vital as food or water. Leaving it was agony, but he\ndid it.\nAnd as hoped, the smaller stairwell was unguarded. They emerged onto\nthe sixth floor in quiet darkness. It seemed most of the tower’s human\npopulation was still confined to quarters. The enemy was working on how\nto rule this place, which should leave Kaladin with an opening. With that in\nmind, he sent Syl on a task."

With that in\nmind, he sent Syl on a task.\nShe zipped out toward the balcony rooms, leaving him crouched in the\nstairwell, armed with his scalpel. Kaladin shivered, wishing he had a coat or\njacket. It felt colder now than it ever had in the tower. Whatever the enemy\nhad done to stop the Radiants had also interfered with the tower’s other\nfunctions. That made him worry about the people.\nSyl eventually returned. “Your family is confined to quarters like\neveryone else,” she said softly. “But there are actual guards at their door. I\ndidn’t dare try to talk to your father or mother, but I saw them together\nthrough the window. They look healthy, if frightened.”\nKaladin nodded. That was the best he could have hoped for, he\nsupposed. Hopefully his father had talked his way out of trouble, as he’d\nsaid. Together, Kaladin and Syl snuck inward to the hallway where the\nlanterns were being installed. The workers had left a pile of lanterns here,\nalong with tools for drilling their mountings into the rock.\nThey hadn’t left gemstones in the equipment piles, and the lanterns in\nthis particular corridor were empty. But in the next corridor over, the\nlanterns had been fitted with amethysts—midsized gemstones for light, a\nlittle larger than a broam. That meant a lot of Stormlight, if he could get it\nout.\n“What do you think?” Kaladin asked Syl. “Grab a crowbar and snap\nthem quickly, then run for it?”\n“Seems like that would make a lot of noise,” she said, landing on one of\nthe lanterns.\n“I could just steal the Stormlight and infuse the spheres I’ve been\ncarrying. I wish I could get some of these gemstones though. I need a better\nreserve.”\n“We could try to find the lampkeeper and get her keys,” Syl said.\n“The one assigned to this floor is a lighteyed woman who lives\nsomewhere on the third floor, I think. Lopen tried to get her to go to dinner\nwith him.”\n“Of course he did,” Syl said. “But … as I think about it, trying to find\nher seems like it would be difficult and dangerous.”\n“Agreed.”\nShe stood on the top of the glowing lantern, then flitted around to the\nside, becoming a ribbon of light, and zipped in through the lantern’s small\nkeyhole. Although she couldn’t pass through solid objects, squeezing\nthrough a crack or hole usually served well enough.\nHer ribbon wound around inside the lantern. These were sturdy iron\ndevices built to resist break-ins. They had glass sides, but those were\nreinforced with a lattice of metal. A key would unlock one of the faces,\nletting you swing it open and access the inside. The other faces of the\nlantern could be unlatched from the inside, and could open as well.\nSyl flew over to one of these latches and formed into a person again.\nTheoretically, if you didn’t have a key, you could break the glass and use a\nwire to manually turn the inside latches to open one of the faces.

But the\ndevice had been designed to make this difficult, with thick glass and that\niron webbing behind.\nSyl tried pushing on the latch, but it was too heavy for her. She put her\nhands on her hips, glaring at it. “Try a Lashing,” Syl called, her voice\nechoing against the glass, louder than her tiny form would have suggested.\n“Lashings don’t work,” Kaladin said softly, keeping an eye down the\ncorridor for guard patrols.\n“Gravitational Lashings don’t work,” Syl said. “The other ones do\nthough, right?”\nWindrunners had three varieties of Lashings. Most commonly he used\nthe gravitational Lashing, where you infused an object or person and\nchanged the direction gravity pulled them. But there were two others. He’d\ntested a Full Lashing while carrying Teft to the clinic during the invasion.\nThat Lashing allowed you to infuse an object with Light and command it to\nstick to anything that touched it. He’d used it during his early days as a\nbridgeman to stick rocks to a chasm wall.\nThe last Lashing was the most strange and arcane of the three. The\nReverse Lashing made something attract other objects. It was like a hybrid\nof the other two. You infused a surface, then commanded it to pull on\nspecific items. They were drawn to it. As if … as if the object you infused\nhad become the source of gravity. As a bridgeman, Kaladin had\nunknowingly used this Lashing to pull arrows through the air to his bridge,\nmaking them swerve to miss his friends.\n“What you call ‘Lashings,’” Syl said to him, “are really two Surges\nworking together. Gravitation and Adhesion, combined in different ways.\nYou say Gravitation Lashings don’t work, and Adhesion ones do. What\nabout a Reverse Lashing?”\n“Haven’t tried,” Kaladin admitted. He stepped to the side and drew the\nStormlight out of a different lantern. He felt the energy, the power, in his\nveins—something he’d been yearning for. He smiled and stepped back,\nalight with power.\n“Try making the glass attract the latch,” Syl said, gesturing. “If you can\nget the latch to move toward you, it will pop out and unlock.”\nHe touched the side of the lantern housing. During the last year, he’d\npracticed his Lashings. Sigzil had monitored, making him do experiments,\nas usual. They’d found that a Reverse Lashing required a command—or at\nleast a visualization of what you wanted. As he infused the glass, he tried to\nimagine the Stormlight attracting things.\nNo, not things. The latch specifically.\nThe Stormlight resisted. As with the basic gravitational Lashing, he\ncould feel the power, but something blocked it. However, the blockage was\nweaker here. He concentrated, pushing harder, and—like a floodgate\nopening—the Light suddenly burst from him. A Reverse Lashing didn’t\nglow as brightly as it should, considering the Stormlight. It was kind of\ninverted, in a way. But Kaladin’s actions were followed by a faint click."

But Kaladin’s actions were followed by a faint click.\nThe power had attracted the latch, which—pulled by that unseen force—\nhad popped free of its housing. Eager, Kaladin slipped the front of the\nlantern open, then plucked the gemstone out and slipped it into his pocket.\nSyl zipped out. “We need more practice on these, Kaladin. You don’t use\nthem as instinctively as the other two.”\nHe nodded, thoughtful, and reclaimed the Stormlight he’d pressed into\nthe lantern housing. Then the two of them moved furtively along the\ncorridor, dropping it into darkness with each gemstone stolen.\n“Reverse Lashings take effort,” Kaladin told Syl softly. “It makes me\nwonder though, if I could somehow make basic gravitational Lashings\nfunction.” He’d come to rely on those in a fight—the ability to leap into the\nair, to send his opponent flying off. Even the simple ability to make himself\nlighter so he flowed more easily through the battle.\nHe finished off the last of the lanterns, satisfied with the healthy\npocketful of Stormlight. A fortune by Hearthstone terms, though he’d\nstarted to grow accustomed to having that much on hand. With these\ngemstones secured in a dark pouch so his pocket wouldn’t glow, the two of\nthem set off on their next task. Supplies.\nThey kept to the inner part of the floor this time, where they’d be able to\nsee a patrol coming by the light it carried. Kaladin led Syl down some steps,\nas he had a good idea of where to get food and water.\nAs he’d hoped, the monastery in the middle of the fourth floor wasn’t a\nhigh priority to guard. He found a pair of singers in uniform occupying one\nwatchpost along the way, but was able to sneak down a side corridor and\nfind a completely unguarded door.\nKaladin and Syl entered, then crept through a corridor lined with cells.\nHe still thought of them that way, even though the ardents here insisted they\nweren’t a prison. Of course, the rooms the ardents themselves stayed in\nwere properly lit, furnished, and downright homey. Kaladin found one of\nthese by the light under the door, checked the glyph painted on the wood,\nthen slipped in.\nHe startled the ardent inside, the same man he’d met during his earlier\nvisit to this place. Kuno, Kaladin had learned his name was. The ardent had\nbeen reading, but scrambled—and failed—to pull his spectacles down onto\nhis eyes as Kaladin crossed the room in a rush and made a shushing gesture.\n“Are there other guards?” Kaladin whispered. “I saw two at the front\ngate.”\n“N-no, Brightlord,” Kuno said, spectacles dangling loosely from his\nfingers. “I … How? How are you here?”\n“By the grace of god or luck. I haven’t decided which. I need supplies.\nRations, jugs of water. Medical supplies if you have any.”\nThe man stuttered, then leaned close, ignoring the spectacles in his hand\nas he squinted at Kaladin. “By the Almighty.

But an\nout-of-the way sanitarium…”\nKuno took them to a little storeroom. Inside, Kaladin was able to find\nalmost everything he needed. A hospital robe and bedpan for Teft. Various\nother articles of clothing. A sponge and washbasin, even a large syringe for\nfeeding someone unconscious.\nKaladin packed these into a sack along with bandages, fathom bark for\npain, and some antiseptic. Some dried rations followed, mostly Soulcast,\nbut they’d do. He tied four wooden jugs of water to a rope he could sling\naround his neck, then noticed a bucket with some cleaning supplies in it. He\npicked out four brushes with thick bristles and sturdy wooden handles, used\nfor scrubbing floors.\n“Need to … wash some floors, Radiant?” the ardent said.\n“No, but I can’t fly anymore, so I need these,” Kaladin said, stuffing\nthem in his bag. “You don’t have any broth, do you?”\n“Not handy,” Kuno said.\n“Pity. What about a weapon?”\n“A weapon? Why would you need one? You have your Blade.”\n“Doesn’t work right now,” Kaladin said.\n“Well, we don’t keep weapons here, Brightlord,” Kuno said, wiping his\nface, which was dripping with sweat. “Storms. You mean … you’re going\nto fight them?”\n“Resist them, at least.” Kaladin put the rope with the jugs around his\nneck, then stood with some effort and settled the weight so the cord didn’t\nbite too harshly. “Don’t tell anyone about me. I don’t want you getting\ntaken in for questioning. I will need more supplies.”\n“You … you’re going to return? Do this … regularly?” The man pulled\nhis spectacles off and wiped his face again.\nKaladin reached out and put his hand on the man’s shoulder. “If we lose\nthe tower, we lose the war. I’m not in any shape to fight. I’m going to do it\nanyway.

I can … I can do that.”\n“Good man,” Kaladin said. “As I said, keep this quiet. I don’t want the\ngeneral public getting it into their heads that they should pick up a spear\nand start fighting against Fused. If there’s a way out of this mess, it will\ninvolve me either getting word to Dalinar or somehow waking the other\nRadiants.”\nHe drew in a little Stormlight. He would need it to help him carry all\nthis, and seeing the glow gave the ardent an obvious boost of confidence.\n“Life before death,” Kaladin said to him.\n“Life before death, Radiant,” Kuno said.\nKaladin picked up his sacks and started out into the darkness.

It was\nslow going, but he eventually arrived on the eleventh floor. Here he oriented\nhimself while Syl poked around to see if she could remember the way. They\nneedn’t have worried—a small spark of light appeared in a vein of garnet\non the floor.\nThey followed the light to the room where they had left Teft. The door\nopened easily, without needing more Stormlight. Inside, Kaladin set down\nhis supplies, checked on his friend, then started a better inventory of what\nhe’d grabbed. The garnet light sparkled on the floor beside him, and he\nbrushed the crystal vein with his fingers.\nA voice immediately popped into his head.\nHighmarshal? Is it true? Are you awake and functioning?\nKaladin started. It was the queen’s voice.\n* * *\nBrightness Navani? Kaladin’s voice said in Navani’s head. I am awake.\nBasically functioning. My powers are … acting strange. I don’t know why\nI’m not comatose like the others.\nNavani drew in a long, deep breath. The Sibling had watched him sneak\nto the fourth floor, then raid a monastery for supplies. While he’d been\nreturning, Navani had done several circuits of her room—talking to her\nscholars and giving them encouragement—to not draw suspicion. Now she\nwas back in position, resting against the wall, trying to look bored.\nShe was anything but. She had access to a Knight Radiant, perhaps two\nif the Sibling could locate Lift. “That is well,” she whispered, the Sibling\ntransferring her words to Kaladin. “For now, I am reluctantly working with\nour captors. They have me and my scholars locked away in the eastern\nbasement study room, near the gemstone pillar.”\nDo you know what’s wrong with the Radiants? he asked.\n“To an extent, yes,” she whispered. “The details are somewhat technical,\nbut the tower had ancient protections to defend it from enemies who were\nusing Voidlight. A Fused scholar inverted this; it now suppresses those who\nwould use Stormlight. She did not complete the tower’s corruption,\nhowever. I narrowly prevented her from doing so by erecting a barrier\naround the pillar. Unfortunately, that same barrier prevents me from\nundoing the work she did there.”\nSo … what do we do?\n“I don’t know,” Navani admitted. Dalinar would have probably told her\nto act strong, to pretend she had a plan when she didn’t—but she wasn’t a\ngeneral. Pretending never worked with her scholars; they appreciated\nhonesty. “I’ve barely had time to plan, and I’m still dragging from\nyesterday.”\nI know that feeling, Kaladin said.\n“The enemy has made the Oathgates work somehow,” Navani said, a\nplan forming in her mind. “My first goal is to continue protecting the\nSibling, the spren of the tower. My second goal is to get word to my\nhusband and the other monarchs. If we could figure out how the enemy is\nmaking the Oathgates work, I might be able to get my spanreeds\nfunctioning and send warning.”"

My only guess is that they are powering them with Voidlight\nsomehow—but I tried to make fabrials use Voidlight in the past, and failed.\nI know for a fact, however, that the enemy has functional spanreeds. I\nhaven’t been able to get a good look at one of those—but if you could find\nout how they’re using the Oathgates, or other fabrials, that would give me\nsomething to work with.”\nI’d need to get close to the Oathgates to do that, Kaladin said. And not\nbe seen doing so.\n“Yes. Can you manage that? I know you said your powers aren’t\nfunctioning completely.”\nI … I’ll find a way, Brightness. I suspect the enemy won’t be using the\nOathgates until nighttime. I think they’re trying to keep up a front of\nnothing being wrong with the tower, in case Dalinar sends scouts. They\nhave some humans wearing Alethi uniforms patrolling outside. At night,\neven distant Windrunners trying to watch would be visible in the darkness. I\nsuspect they’d find this a safer time to use the Oathgates.\nCurious indeed. How long did Raboniel realistically think she could\nkeep up such a subterfuge? Surely Dalinar would withdraw from the\nbattlefield in Azir and focus everything on discovering what was wrong\nwith Urithiru. Unless there were aspects to this that Navani wasn’t\nconsidering.\nThe implications of that frightened her. She was blind, locked away in\nthis basement.\n“Highmarshal,” she said to Kaladin, “I’ll try to contact you again\ntomorrow around the same time. Until then, be warned. The enemy will be\nseeking a way to disrupt the shield I erected. There are three nodes hidden\nin the tower, large gemstones infused with Stormlight that are maintaining\nthe barrier, but the Sibling won’t say where they are.\n“These nodes are direct channels to the heart of the tower, and as such\nare great points of vulnerability. If you find one, tell me. And be aware, if\nthe enemy gains access to it, they can complete the tower’s corruption.”\nYes, sir. Er. Brightness.\n“I need to go. Lift is awake somewhere too, so it would be worth\nkeeping an eye out for her. At any rate, take care, Highmarshal. If the task\nproves too dangerous, retreat. We are too few right now to take unwise\nrisks.”\nUnderstood. After a moment’s pause, the Sibling’s voice continued, He\nhas gone back to unpacking his supplies. You should be careful though, how\nyou ask after fabrials. Do not forget that I consider what you have done to\nbe a high crime.\n“I’ve not forgotten,” Navani said. “But surely you don’t oppose the\nOathgates.”\nI do not, the Sibling said, sounding reluctant. Those spren have gone"

Our talking\nis suspicious.\nNavani didn’t press the matter, instead making another circuit around her\nscholars. She wasn’t certain whether she trusted what the Sibling said.\nCould spren lie? She didn’t think she’d ever asked the Radiants’ spren. A\nfoolish oversight.\nAt any rate, in Kaladin she at least had a connection to the rest of the\ntower. A lifeline. That was one step forward in finding a way out of this\nmess.\nWhen in such a state, detachment is enviable. I have learned that my\ngreatest discoveries come when I abandon lesser connections.\n—From Rhythm of War, page 3 undertext\nTwo days after defeating Taravangian’s traitors, Dalinar stood in the war\ntent, helping prepare for the larger offensive against the singers in Emul.\nJust behind him stood Szeth in disguise. Nobody gave the man a second\nglance; Dalinar often had members of the Cobalt Guard with him.\nDalinar surveyed the war table with its maps and lists of troop numbers.\nSo many different pieces, representing the state of their fighting across\nmany different battlefronts. When he’d been younger, these types of\nabstractions had frustrated him. He’d wanted to be on the battlefield, Blade\nin hand, smashing his way through enemy lines and making such maps\nobsolete.\nThen he’d begun to see the armies behind the little squares on the sheets\nof paper. Begun to truly grasp how the movement of troops—supplies,\nlogistics, large-scale tactics—was more important than winning a given\nbattle in person. And it had excited him.\nSomehow he’d moved beyond that now. War—and all its facets—no\nlonger excited him. It was important, and it was a thing he would do. But he\nhad discovered a greater duty.\nHow do we win? Truly win, not merely gain an advantage for a time?\nHe mused on these thoughts as his generals and head scribes presented\ntheir final conclusions on the Veden betrayal.\n“Our troops in southern Alethkar were successfully supported by the\nThaylen ships, as you advised,” Teshav said. “Our generals along the coast\nwere able to retreat through a series of fortresses as you directed. They have\nregrouped at Karanak—which we control. Because none of our battalions\nwere completely surrounded by Vedens, we suffered virtually no losses.”\n“Our navy locked the Veden ships into their ports,” said Kmakl, the\naging Thaylen prince consort. “They won’t break our blockade anytime\nsoon, unless the Fused and Skybreakers give them heavy air support.”\n“We destroyed almost all the Vedens who betrayed us here,” said Omal,\na short Azish general who wore a brightly colored patterned sash across his\nuniform coat. “Your leadership on the battlefield was excellent, Blackthorn\n—not to mention the timeliness of your warnings before the battle.

Instead\nof burning our supply dumps and rescuing their king, they were nearly\neliminated.”\nDalinar looked across the table at the Mink, who was smiling with a gap-\ntoothed sense of satisfaction.\n“This was very well handled, Uncle,” Jasnah said to him, surveying the\nwar table map. “You averted a catastrophe.”\nNoura conferred with the Azish emperor, who sat on a throne near the\nside of the battle tent, then walked over. “We regret the loss of such an\nimportant ally in Taravangian,” she said. “This betrayal will be felt—and\nprosecuted—by the Azish for generations. That said, we too approve of\nyour handling of the situation. You did well to remain suspicious of him all\nthese months, and we were unwise to think his treachery was all in the\npast.”\nDalinar leaned over the table, which was lit with spheres. Though he\nmissed the large illusory map he could create with Shallan, there was\nsomething about the tangible feeling of this map, the paper marked up with\nthe thoughts of his best generals, that spoke to him. As he stared, everything\nbut the map seemed to fade from his view.\nSomething was still wrong. Taravangian had been so subtle for so many\nmonths. Yet now he let himself be captured?\nHis armies in Jah Keved seem not to care much about him, Dalinar\nthought, reading the displayed battle reports and figures as if they were\nwhispered explanations in his ears. The Veden highprinces will be happy to\nput their own men in charge. And they seem quick to side with the singers,\nas the Iriali were.\nKharbranth, led by Taravangian’s daughter Savrahalidem, had disavowed\ntheir former ruler and proclaimed themselves neutral in the conflict—with\ntheir surgeons willing to continue serving whichever side petitioned their\naid. Dalinar would have his ships blockade them just in case—but he wasn’t\nabout to land troops there and fight a costly battle for such a relatively\nunimportant target. They likely knew that.\nThe real prize was Taravangian himself. Someone Dalinar already held\ncaptive. After the elderly king’s careful posturing over the years, how had\nhe let his empire collapse practically overnight?\nWhy? Why risk it now?\n“What news of Urithiru?” Dalinar asked.\n“Windrunners should return soon with their latest visual on the tower,”\nTeshav said from the dim perimeter of the table. “But Brightness Navani’s\nmost recent spanreed letter indicates that our people there are managing\nwell.”\nNavani continued to send soldiers hiking along the outside of the\nmountain faces to deliver messages. Each new bit told them a little more.\nSome of Taravangian’s scholars had activated a device like the one\nHighmarshal Kaladin had found. A separate collapse of the tunnels below—\nlikely the work of saboteurs—made getting in and out that way impossible.\nThe device was hidden, and Navani hadn’t been able to find and\ndeactivate it. She worried the search would take weeks. Unfortunately,"

She worried the search would take weeks. Unfortunately,\nDalinar’s scouts had proven the device’s effectiveness. If they drew too\nclose, they not only lost their powers, but dropped unconscious.\nFor now though, it seemed that everyone was safe—though\ninconvenienced. If Dalinar hadn’t been anticipating the betrayal, things\ncould have gone very differently. He could imagine a version of events\nwhere Taravangian’s betrayal threw the coalition into chaos, allowing the\nsinger military to surge forward and push Dalinar’s troops all the way back\nto Azimir. There, without proper resupply and support, they could have\nbeen crushed.\nPerhaps that’s it, he thought. Perhaps that was what Taravangian was\nintending—why he risked so much. The king, so far, had remained silent\nduring interrogations. Perhaps Dalinar could speak to him directly and get\nmore information. But he worried that somehow all of this was according to\nTaravangian’s plans, and Dalinar was second-guessing himself at every\npoint.\n“Monarchs,” Dalinar said to the group, “I suggest we continue our battle\nfor Emul until we have more information about Urithiru.”\n“Agreed,” the Azish emperor said immediately.\n“I will seek approval from the guilds of Thaylenah and the queen,”\nPrince Kmakl said, scanning through naval reports. “But for now, I have no\nproblem with continuing to let the Alethi generals lead. However,\nBrightlord Dalinar, you realize this betrayal is going to make recovering\nyour homeland even more difficult.”\n“I do,” Dalinar said. “I still believe that the best thing we can do for\nAlethkar’s eventual recovery is to first secure the West.”\nEach of those words was a knife stabbing at his heart. It meant giving\nAlethkar up for years. Perhaps longer. With Jah Keved as a staging area,\nhe’d been able to entertain dreams of striking right for Kholinar. No longer.\nStorming Taravangian. Damnation take you.\nWith Kmakl and the Azish weighing in, the sole monarch who hadn’t\nspoken up was Jasnah. She inspected the maps, Wit—as ever—standing at\nher shoulder.\n“I assume, Uncle,” she said, “that you will be letting the Mink prosecute\nthis campaign?”\n“This is a larger conflict than one man can direct on his own,” Dalinar\nsaid. “But after his handling of the battle two days ago, I think he’s proven\nhis worth. One of the reasons I worked so hard to recruit him was to have\nhis particular genius directing our strategy.”\n“At the will of the monarchs,” the Mink said, “I’ll do this—but\nremember your promises. I won’t have you escape them. Once we\ninevitably liberate Alethkar, my kingdom is next.”\nJasnah nodded. “I would like to see your battle plans, General Dieno. I\ngive my initial approval to our continued offensive into Emul, but I will\nwant details. Losing access to the Oathgates is going to prove disruptive.”\nWith that, Dalinar called an end to the meeting. People began to uncover"

People began to uncover\nspheres around the perimeter of the war pavilion—revealing how enormous\nit truly was. It had to be large enough to accommodate everyone’s\nentourages, and so the map table looked small once everyone started\nretreating to their sections of the tent.\nKmakl made his way over to the Thaylen scribes, where they used\nspanreeds to send minutes of the meeting home to Fen and the Thaylen\nguildmasters. Dalinar shook his head. He agreed with Fen’s decision to stay\nbehind, and wished that Jasnah had made the same choice. Too many\nmonarchs in one location made him nervous.\nIt also bothered him that so much of what Queen Fen did was subject to\nthe whims of a bunch of merchants and guildmasters. If they did win this\nwar, he’d see if he could find a way to help her wrest control of her\nkingdom from those eels.\nThe Azish and Emuli contingents began to vacate the war tent, letting in\nsome fresh air. Dalinar used a handkerchief to mop at the sweat on the back\nof his neck—this region of Roshar wasn’t as muggy as the parts around the\nReshi Isles, but the summer weather here was still too hot for his taste. He\nalmost wanted to have one of the Windrunners fly him up to a higher\naltitude where he could get some proper cold air and think clearly.\nHe settled for stepping outside the tent and surveying the camp. They’d\ncommandeered a small town named Laqqi, just inside the Emuli border, not\ntoo far from Azimir. That placed it about a three-day march from the\nbattlefront, where their lines—soon to be reinforced—held against the\nenemy forces to the south.\nLittle more than a village, Laqqi had been overrun by troops setting up\nsupply stations and command tents. Workers reinforced the eastern\napproach to block storms, and Windrunners soared through the air. This\nposition made for an excellent command center, close enough to the\nbattlefront to be reached by short flight, but far enough away to be protected\nfrom ground assault.\nDalinar took some time out here, after checking that little Gav was\nplaying happily with his governess, to think about Evi. Storms, he’d been so\nproud at Adolin’s birth. How had he let himself miss so much of his son’s\nchildhood?\nHe turned those memories over in his head. At first, he’d found being\nable to remember Evi to be novel—but the more the memories settled with\nhim, the more they felt comfortable, like a familiar seat by the fire. He was\nashamed of so much of what he’d remembered about himself, but he would\nnot trade these memories again. He needed them. Needed her.\nHe enjoyed the fresh air for a time, breathing deeply, before he returned\nto the tent to get something to drink. Szeth followed with his hand on his\noversized sword—the silver sheath and black hilt were masked by a\ndisguise. Szeth didn’t say anything, but Dalinar knew that he considered his\ndefeat by Nale to be shameful. In Dalinar’s estimation, it spoke more of the"

In Dalinar’s estimation, it spoke more of the\nHerald’s skill than anything else. Why was it Nale so often stayed out of\nbattles, overseeing his Skybreakers from afar?\nJasnah joined Dalinar as he poured himself some wine in the tent, by the\nbar. She knew what Szeth really was, but she was too politic to give him so\nmuch as a glance.\n“You’re stepping away from the fight, Uncle,” she noted quietly. “I\nexpected you to lead the war effort here personally.”\n“I have found someone more capable to do the job.”\n“Pardon, Uncle, but you should find a better lie. You never let go of\nsomething you’re interested in doing yourself. It’s one of your more\nconsistent behaviors.”\nHe stilled himself, then glanced about the room. She shouldn’t have\nconfronted him here, where representatives of the other monarchs might\nhear. Knowing Jasnah, that was part of the reason she had done so. With\nher, every conversation was a little contest, and she always considered the\nterrain.\n“I’m beginning to realize something,” he said softly, stepping her over to\nthe side, away from the bar. Szeth stayed close, as did Wit. Others gave\nthem space. “My powers as a Bondsmith are more valuable than we have\nknown. I told you about how, in the battle, I touched Nalan and saw his\npast.”\n“A feat you’ve been unable to replicate with Shalash or Talenelat.”\n“Yes, because I don’t know what I’m doing!” Dalinar said. “I am a\nweapon we haven’t fully investigated. I need to learn how to use these\npowers—use them for more than merely renewing spheres and opening the\nperpendicularity.”\n“I appreciate someone wanting to learn, Uncle,” Jasnah said. “But you\nare already a powerful weapon. You are one of our greatest military minds.”\n“I need to become something more,” Dalinar said. “I’m worried that this\nwar is going to be an endless give-and-take. We seize Emul, but lose Jah\nKeved. Back and forth, back and forth. How do we win, Jasnah? What is\nour end goal?”\nShe nodded slowly. “We need to push Odium to an accord. You think\nlearning about your powers can help you achieve this?”\nOver a year had passed since Odium had agreed to a contest by\nchampions—but since then, Dalinar hadn’t seen the being. No visits. No\nvisions. Not even a messenger.\n“Rayse—Odium—is not one to be pushed into anything,” Wit said from\nover Jasnah’s shoulder. “He might have agreed to a contest in theory,\nBlackthorn, but he never set terms. And he won’t, as long as he thinks he’s\nwinning this war. You need to frighten him, convince him that he might\nlose. Only then will he proceed with a contest of champions—as long as the\nterms limit his losses.”\n“I would rather a complete victory than something that allows Odium to\nhedge his bets,” Dalinar said.\n“Ah, delightful,” Wit replied, holding up his palm and mimicking\nwriting something down. “I’ll just make a note that you’d like to win. Yes,"

Over a god.\nWho is currently holding your homeland, and recently gained the allegiance\nof one of the strongest militaries on the planet. Shall I also have him bake\nyou something sweet as an apology for this whole ‘end of the world’\nmess?”\n“That will do, Wit,” Dalinar said with a sigh.\n“The baking thing is an actual tradition,” Wit added. “I once visited a\nplace where—if you lose a battle—your mother has to bake the other fellow\nsomething tasty. I rather liked those people.”\n“Pity you didn’t remain with them longer,” Dalinar said.\n“Ha! Well, I didn’t think it wise to stay around. After all, they were\ncannibals.”\nDalinar shook his head, focusing back on the task at hand. “Wit says we\nhave to somehow persuade Odium we’re a threat. But I think the enemy is\nmanipulating us. This entire trick with Taravangian has me unsettled. We’re\ndealing with a god, but we aren’t using all the tools at our disposal.”\nHe held up his palm. “With this, I can touch his world, the Spiritual\nRealm. And when I was fighting Nalan, I felt something, saw something.\nWhat if I could reforge the Oathpact? If the Fused stopped being reborn,\nwould that not give us—at last—an edge over Odium? Something to force\nhim to negotiate on our terms?”\nJasnah folded her arms, pensive. Wit, however, leaned in. “You know,”\nWit whispered, “I think he might be right. I feel ashamed to admit it, but the\nBlackthorn has seen further than we have, Jasnah. He is more valuable as a\nBondsmith than as a general—or even a king.”\n“You make a good argument, Uncle,” Jasnah admitted. “I’m simply\nworried. If your powers are so incredible, it feels dangerous to experiment\nwith them. My own first forays into Soulcasting were deadly at times. What\nwill your greater abilities do, by accident, in similar situations?”\nIt was a valid point, one that left them solemn as they picked up cups of\nwine and drank in silence, thinking. As they stood there, Prince Kmakl\npassed by on his way out of the tent, listening as a scribe read him a draft of\na letter to the merchant lords of Thaylen City.\n“Another topic, Uncle,” Jasnah noted. “Lately, I see your eyes narrow\nwhen you look at Prince Kmakl. I thought you liked Fen and her husband.”\n“I do like them,” he said. “I just don’t like how much bureaucracy Fen\nhas to go through before anything gets done. The Azish are even worse.\nWhy name your ruler an ‘emperor’ if he has to get approval from a dozen\ndifferent functionaries to do his job?”\n“One is a constitutional monarchy, the other a scholarly republic,”\nJasnah said, sounding amused. “What did you expect?”\n“A king to be a king,” he muttered, drinking the rest of his wine in one\ngulp."

We’d do well to learn from them.”\nShe eyed him, thoughtful. “The days of absolute power in one person’s\nhands will likely soon pass us by. I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m the last true\nAlethi monarch.”\n“What would your father say, hearing you talk like that?”\n“I suspect I could make him understand,” she said. “He was interested in\nhis legacy. Building something that would span generations. His goals were\nlaudable, but his methods … well, our kingdom has been difficult to\nmaintain. A king ruling by the gauntlet and sword can easily see it slip away\nwhen he weakens. Compare this to the Azish system, where a bad Prime is\nunable to single-handedly ruin their government.”\n“And a good one is unable to accomplish much,” Dalinar said, then held\nhis hand up to forestall further argument. “I see what you’re saying. But I\nfind nobility in the traditional way of rule.”\n“Having read the histories, I believe the nobility you imagine is created\nfrom stories about the inhabitants of ancient days, but rarely possessed by\nsaid inhabitants. Those kings tended to live short, brutal lives. No matter.\nOnce we win this war, I expect to have decades to persuade you.”\nKelek help him. Dalinar poured himself more orange wine.\n“I will think on what you said about your powers,” Jasnah said, “and I\nwill see if I can offer any advice on how to proceed. For now, Uncle, know\nthat I trust your judgment in this, and will help support the Mink if you take\na smaller role in war planning. You are right, and I was wrong to question.”\n“One is never wrong to question,” Dalinar said. “You taught me that.”\nShe patted his arm fondly, then walked off to turn her attention to the\nmaps the Mink was marking up on the war table.\nWit lingered, smiling at Dalinar. “I agree with her,” he whispered. “And\non the topic of monarchs, I will have you know that I find you to be an\nendearing despot. You’re so pleasant, I almost don’t find it horrifying that\nI’m living among a people willing to trust a single man with near-absolute\npower over the lives of hundreds of thousands—while completely ignoring\nproper checks and balances upon his potential greed, jealousy, or ambition.”\n“Did you really have to come with us, Wit?” Dalinar asked. “I…” He\ntrailed off. Then shook his head.\n“What?” Wit asked.\n“Never mind. Saying anything would provide you with more rocks to\nthrow at me.”\n“And you’re supposed to be the dumb one,” Wit said, grinning. “When\nhave I ever mocked you, though?”\n“All the time, Wit. You mock everyone.”\n“Do I? Do I really? Hmmm…” He tapped his chin. “I’m gainfully\nemployed as Queen’s Wit, and she expects me to provide only the best of\nmockery on her behalf. I need to be careful about simply giving it away."

I need to be careful about simply giving it away.\nWho is going to buy the cow, and all that.”\nDalinar frowned. “What is a cow?”\n“Big, juicy, delicious. Wish I could still eat them. You don’t seem to\nhave them around here, which I find amazing, as I’m sure there was one\nsomewhere in Sadeas’s lineage. Paternal grandfather perhaps. Watch the\nhighprinces. There’s almost certainly going to be a show.” He sauntered off\nto take his customary position near Jasnah.\nWatch the highprinces? What did that mean? For the most part, they\nwere becoming a useful lot. Aladar kept reinforcing Dalinar’s trust in him,\nand Dalinar had sent him to oversee the withdrawal in Alethkar. Hatham\nhad fallen into line, and Dalinar had him watching the supply chain from\nAzimir. Bethab was proving quite useful as an ambassador stationed in\nThaylen City—or, well, his wife was the useful one, but they were both\nproving helpful. Roion was dead with honors, his son carefully chosen to\nnot make things difficult. Even Sebarial was relevant these days.\nOne highprince was currently with Dalinar in Emul. Ruthar. Dalinar\nfocused on the brawny, bearded man. He was the worst of those left; he\nfancied himself a soldier, but had never worn a proper uniform in his life.\nToday he hovered near the far end of the bar, by the strong wines. At least\nhe’d learned to stop contradicting Dalinar in front of the other monarchs.\nDalinar narrowed his eyes toward Jasnah, who was making a display of\ngoing over the battle plans with the Mink. She’s putting on a show, he\nthought, noting how she specifically called out details on the maps,\nsuggesting troop arrangements. She did a fair job, though she was no\ngeneral.\nThe Mink listened to her suggestions, but likely wouldn’t take many of\nthem. He seemed to find her fascinating. Well, Jasnah was a rare gemstone\nfor certain. Was her show for the Mink? No … this had to do with Ruthar,\ndidn’t it?\nFurther musings were interrupted as a figure in blue entered the tent. Lyn\nthe Windrunner wore her hair in a braid, though wisps had pulled free\nduring her flight. She’d led the most recent scouting of Urithiru.\nDalinar waved her over, and noted Jasnah at the map table quieting and\nturning to listen as Lyn gave her report.\n“We met with the soldier the queen sent,” the Windrunner explained,\nsaluting. “I myself tried to step through the invisible barrier and approach. I\ndropped to the snow like I’d taken a hit straight to the jaw. The soldier had\nto drag me out to the others.”\n“Did you see my wife?”\n“No, sir,” Lyn said. “But that hike … it looks brutal. Radiants can’t get\nwithin hundreds of yards of the tower, so this soldier has to march all the\nway back and forth along the ridges for hours to get to where he can send\nmessages.”\nDalinar rubbed his chin in thought.

But passcodes were not foolproof,\nand something about this just felt wrong. “What can you see from a\ndistance? Anything?”\n“We had to use spyglasses,” Lyn said. “There weren’t as many people\nout as usual, but there were some Windrunners on the roof, and I think I\nmade out Teft up there, and Isom the Lightweaver. They held up a big sign,\nwith glyphs that we think read ‘patience’ and ‘progress.’”\nDalinar nodded. “Thank you, Radiant. Go give a full report, with details,\nto Brightness Teshav, then get something to eat.”\n“Thank you, sir,” she said. She started toward the exit.\nSomething nagged at Dalinar, however. That weight hadn’t completely\neased. “Lyn?” he called.\n“Sir?”\n“The enemy has Lightweavers. Or at least something similar.”\n“Yes, sir,” she said. “Though the only confirmed report we have of them\nis that incursion at the Thaylen vault a year ago.”\nHe resisted shooting a glance at Szeth—so quiet, so easy to forget—\nstanding nearby, wearing the face of an Alethi man.\n“Ask Companylord Sigzil to send another team of scouts later tonight,”\nDalinar said. “I’ll infuse the traveling gemstones for another run. Have this\nnew team watch the tower from a distance, hidden, then report anything\nsuspicious they might see.”\n“Wise suggestion, sir,” Lyn said, then bowed and retreated.\nJasnah nodded to him, then returned to her exaggerated discussion of the\nmaps. Yes, she was acting a role here.\nDalinar glanced at Ruthar, whose face was steadily growing redder.\nPerhaps he’d had a few drinks too many while waiting for the monarchs to\nfinish their planning, but plainly he did not like how Jasnah was blatantly\ninterjecting herself into the war plans. It was a masculine art, and Ruthar\nhad been forbidden from participating in the planning today.\nLooking at him, it was hard not to agree with what Jasnah had said about\nAlethkar. Gavilar’s grand unification of the kingdom hadn’t lasted ten years\npast his death before essentially breaking into civil war. Alethi squabbling\nhad ended up favoring men like Ruthar. Oily, belligerent, aggressive. The\nlast representation of old Alethkar.\nJasnah was making herself into bait. And Ruthar bit. Hard.\n“Am I the only one seeing this?” Ruthar asked a little too loudly to his\nattendants. “I didn’t say anything when she was made queen. Other nations\nhave queens. But are any of them in this room interrogating a general?”\nOne of his companions tried to calm him, but he brushed her off,\nshouting, “It’s a disgrace! Dalinar writing? He might as well put on a havah\nand start painting. We deserve the judgments of the Almighty, after giving\nthe throne to a godless wh—” He stopped himself just in time, perhaps\nrealizing how still the tent had grown.\nDalinar stepped forward to berate the man. There was nothing for it now\nbut to—\n“Wit,” Jasnah said, her voice cold."

There was nothing for it now\nbut to—\n“Wit,” Jasnah said, her voice cold.\nWit strode forward, his hands spread to the sides, as if stepping out from\nbehind curtains to face an adoring crowd. “I see you’re envious of those\nmore skilled in the masculine arts than you, Ruthar,” Wit said. “I agree, you\ncould use lessons on how to be a man—but those in this room would teach\nlessons far too advanced. Let me call in a eunuch to instruct you, and once\nyou’ve reached his level, we’ll talk further.”\n“Harsher,” Jasnah said.\n“You speak of honor, Ruthar, though you’ve never known it,” Wit said,\nhis voice rising. “You’ll never find it though. You see, I hid your honor in a\nplace you could never find it: in the arms of someone who truly loves you.”\n“Wit,” Jasnah said. “Harsher.”\n“I’ve been speaking to your children, Ruthar,” Wit said. “No, this part\nisn’t a joke. Relis, Ivanar. Yes, I know them. I know a lot of things. Would\nyou like to explain to the queen where Ivanar’s broken arm last month truly\ncame from? Tell me, do you beat your children because you’re a sadist, or\nbecause you’re a coward and they are the only ones who won’t dare fight\nback? Or … oh, silly Wit. It’s both, isn’t it?”\n“How dare you!” Ruthar roared, shoving away the attendant who tried to\ncontrol him. Angerspren rose around his feet, like pools of bubbling blood.\n“I demand trial by swords! Me versus you, stupid fool. Or me against your\nchampion, if you’re too much of a coward to face me!”\n“Trial by combat accepted,” Wit said lightly, undoing his belt and sliding\nfree his sheathed sword. “Shall we?”\n“Fine!” Ruthar said, drawing his sword, causing many of the women and\nattendants to scatter to the sides of the large tent.\n“This is idiocy,” Dalinar said, stepping between them. “Ruthar, you’ve\nbeen baited. Killing a Queen’s Wit is punishable by exile and forfeit of title.\nYou know this.”\nRuthar grunted, the words sinking in.\n“Besides,” Dalinar said, glancing over his shoulder, “that man is no\nsimple Wit. I’m not sure if you can kill him.”\n“You tell me I’d forfeit my title,” Ruthar growled. “What title? What\nlands do I hold? And exile? We are in exile, Blackthorn. Maybe I should\nchallenge you. You’ve lost our kingdom, and now you expect me to waste\nmy time in foreign lands? Protecting those we should have conquered? We\nwould have, if your nephew had been half the man his father was.”\n“Ruthar,” Wit said, “you don’t need to fight him. Or me. I accept your\nchallenge, but I exercise my right to choose a champion. You won’t risk\nlosing your lands by killing a Wit.”\n“Excellent,” Ruthar said. “I accept. Stop trying to interfere, Blackthorn.”"

Stop trying to interfere, Blackthorn.”\nDalinar reluctantly stepped to the side. He felt a mounting dread, but\nthere was nothing illegal here. And he doubted any action he could take\nwould prevent this trap from springing.\n“So,” Ruthar said, brandishing his sword. “Wit. You call me coward,\nthen wiggle out of a challenge? So be it! Who do you want me to kill,\nthen?”\n“Your Majesty?” Wit said. “If you don’t mind?” He cocked his sheathed\nsword to the side, hilt out, as Jasnah brushed past and drew the weapon—a\nthin, silvery blade that Dalinar didn’t think he’d ever seen unsheathed.\nDalinar’s dread deepened as Jasnah stepped into striking range, batting\naside Ruthar’s sword. He recovered from his shock and blocked her next\nstrike. She was better than Dalinar might have expected, but her stance was\nuncertain, and she overreached. At best, she was equal to a promising\nstudent.\nShe had two distinct advantages though. She was Radiant. And Ruthar\nwas an idiot.\n“I refuse this,” he said, tossing his sword aside. “I will not face a woman\nin combat. It is demeaning.”\nAnd so, Jasnah stabbed him straight through the throat.\nThis lunge was better than the previous one, but it was not her skill that\nwon the fight—it was the fact that Ruthar underestimated how far she\nwould go. Indeed, Ruthar’s eyes bulged as shockspren shattered around him\nas yellow glass. He stumbled back, gushing lifeblood across his beautiful\ndoublet.\n“Renarin!” Jasnah called.\nDalinar’s younger son scrambled into the tent from outside, and the full\nlevel of her preparation became manifest. The twisting feeling in Dalinar’s\nstomach began to release. He’d been preparing to lock down the tent, send\nguards for Ruthar’s next of kin, and institute martial law.\nRenarin scurried forward and used his powers as a Truthwatcher to heal\nRuthar, sealing up the wound in the man’s neck before he bled out. Still,\nDalinar caught the eye of Fisk, the current captain of the Cobalt Guard. He\nwas a solid fellow, bearer of the Blade Loremaker. Fisk nodded in\nunderstanding, and covertly signaled his soldiers to create a perimeter\naround the tent—nobody in or out—until Dalinar was ready to let news of\nthis incident spread.\nJasnah held Wit’s sword out to her side, and he took it, clicking his\ntongue. “Not willing to wipe the blood off first, Brightness? I suppose this\nis the sword’s first kill. Adonalsium knows, I could never give her that\nmyself. Still.” He wiped the weapon clean with a white handkerchief,\nglancing at Ruthar. “I’ll be billing you for a new handkerchief.”\nBoth Wit and Jasnah pointedly ignored the horrified expressions of the\nroom’s attendants. The standout exception was the Mink, who was grinning\nat the show. Dalinar almost expected him to begin applauding."

Dalinar almost expected him to begin applauding.\nDalinar felt no such mirth. Although she hadn’t gone all the way, he\ndidn’t like Jasnah’s statement. Duels of passion were—if not common—an\naccepted part of Alethi culture. He himself had killed more than one man at\na feast or other gathering. It was reminiscent, however, of their barbaric\ndays as broken princedoms. Times that the Alethi tried to pretend had never\nhappened. These days, this sort of thing was supposed to be handled in a\nmore civilized way, with formal challenges and duels in arenas days later.\n“Ruthar,” Jasnah said, standing above him. “You have insulted me thrice\ntonight. First, by implying a queen should not take concern for the welfare\nof her own armies. Second, by threatening to assault my Wit, a man who is\nan extension of the royal will. Third and worst of all, by judging me unfit to\ndefend myself, despite my calling as a Knight Radiant.\n“As you have died tonight, and I have bested you legally in combat, I\nname you forfeit of your title. It will pass to your eldest son, who has been\nspeaking quite frankly with Wit recently. It seems he will make a far more\nfitting highprince.”\n“That bastard!” Ruthar croaked. “That traitorous bastard!”\n“Not yours then, is he?” Wit said. “That explains why I like him.”\n“What you do from here is your choice,” Jasnah said. “Unfortunately, by\nthe time you leave this tent, you will find that your princedom has quite\nthoroughly moved on. You’ll be barred entrance to your own camp, should\nyou try to return. I suggest you join the military as a new recruit.\nAlternatively, you may take up the queen’s charity at the Beggars’ Feasts\nand poorhouses.”\nShe left him gaping on the floor and touching his healed neck—still wet\nwith blood. Renarin awkwardly hurried after Jasnah as she moved over to\nthe map table.\nWit dropped his bloody handkerchief before Ruthar. “How remarkable,”\nhe said. “If you spend your life knocking people down, you eventually find\nthey won’t stand up for you. There’s poetry in that, don’t you think, you\nstorming personification of a cancerous anal discharge?”\nDalinar marched up beside Jasnah at the table. Szeth stayed close behind\nhim, carefully watching Ruthar, silent but making certain Dalinar’s back\nwas guarded. Renarin stood with his hands in his pockets and refused to\nmeet Dalinar’s gaze. The boy likely felt guilty for keeping this little plan\nquiet, though Dalinar wasn’t angry at him. Denying Jasnah was next to\nimpossible in situations like this.\n“Don’t glare at me, Uncle,” Jasnah said softly. “It was a lesson I had to\ngive. Ruthar was a mouthpiece for many other discontented grumblings.”\n“I had assumed,” he said, “that you of all people would wish to teach\nyour lessons without a sword.”\n“I would much prefer it,” she said. “But you cannot tame a feral"

You use raw meat.”\nShe eyed the still-stunned people in the tent. They were all quite\ndeliberately staying away from Ruthar. Dalinar met Fisk’s eyes, then\nnodded again. The lockdown could be eased. Ruthar’s closest allies were\nfickle, and would see his fallen state as a disease to be avoided. Jasnah had\nalready secured the loyalty of those who could have been dangerous—his\nfamily and military advisors.\n“You should know,” Dalinar said, “that I found this entire experience\ndistasteful. And not only because you didn’t warn me it was going to\nhappen.”\n“That is why I didn’t warn you,” Jasnah said. “Here. This may calm\nyou.” She tapped a paper she’d set onto the map table, which the Mink\npicked up and began reading with great interest. He looked like he hadn’t\nbeen so entertained in years.\n“A draft of a new law,” the short man said. “Forbidding trial by sword.\nHow unexciting.”\nJasnah plucked the paper from his fingers. “I will use my own\nunfortunate experience today as an example of why this is a terrible\ntradition. Ruthar’s blood will be the last such spilled. And as we leave this\nera of barbarism, each and every attendant at court will know that\nAlethkar’s first queen is a woman unafraid of doing what needs to be done.\nHerself.”\nShe was firm, so Dalinar tucked away his anger, then turned to leave. A\npart of him understood her move, and it was likely to be effective. Yet at the\nsame time, it displayed that Jasnah Kholin—brilliant, determined—was not\nperfect. There were things about her that unnerved even the callous soldier\nthat lived deep inside him.\nAs he walked away, Renarin hurried over. “Sorry,” the boy whispered. “I\ndidn’t know she hadn’t told you.”\n“It’s all right, son,” Dalinar said. “I suspect that without you, she’d have\ngone through with the plan anyway—then left him to bleed out on the\nfloor.”\nRenarin ducked his head. “Father. I’ve … had an episode.”\nDalinar stopped. “Anything urgent?”\n“No.”\n“Can I find you later today, maybe tomorrow?” Dalinar asked. “I want to\nhelp contain the fallout from this stunt.”\nRenarin nodded quickly, then slipped out of the tent. Ruthar had\nstumbled to his feet, holding his neck, his gaudy yellow outfit now ruined.\nHe searched around the room as if for succor, but his former friends and\nattendants were quietly slipping away—leaving only soldiers and the queen,\nwho stood with her back to him. As if Ruthar were no longer worth\nattention.\nWit stood in his jet-black suit, one hand on the map table, leaning at a\nnearly impossible angle. Dalinar often found Wit with a grin on his face, but\nnot today. Today the man looked cold, emotionless. His eyes were deep\nvoids, their color invisible in the dim light."

Could … I do something similar in facing Odium?\nAnger the god somehow, forcing him to accept a reckless agreement?\nHow did one intimidate a creature as powerful as Odium? What, on all\nof Roshar, could a god possibly fear or hate so much? He’d have to bring up\nthe matter with Jasnah and Wit. Though … not today.\nToday he’d had enough of their machinations.\nThis song—this tone, this rhythm—sounds so familiar, in ways I cannot\nexplain or express.\n—From Rhythm of War, page 5\n“Only the femalens among your staff read?” Raboniel asked to Craving as\nthey stood in the hallway outside the room with the crystal pillar. “I would\nhave thought better of your instruction, Venli, considering how capable you\nare in other areas. Your staff shouldn’t follow foolish human customs.”\nVenli’s staff of singers—the ones carefully recruited in Kholinar over the\nlast year—had arrived in Urithiru via the Oathgate transfers early this\nmorning. Raboniel had immediately put them to work. Nearby, the femalens\nwere sorting through the boxes of notes and equipment the human queen\nhad moved out into the hallway. Young human scribes were adding to that,\nrepositioning boxes, making a general scene of chaos.\nVenli’s staff, at Raboniel’s order, were doing their best to make sense of\nit—and to read through the pages and pages of notes to try to find important\npoints to bring to Raboniel’s attention. They would soon take scholarform\nto help, but the task was still difficult. Venli had instructed them to do their\nbest.\nToday, Raboniel stood with her back to the blue shield, watching the\nconfusion in the hallway and humming to herself.\nVenli hummed to Indifference. “Ancient One,” she said, “my staff are\ngood—but they are culturally Alethi. My own people, the listeners, would\nhave happily taught them a better way—but the listeners were taken by\nOdium, in his wisdom.”\n“Do you question Odium, Venli?” Raboniel said to Craving.\n“I have been taught that Passion does a person credit, Ancient One,”\nVenli said. “And to wonder, to question, is a Passion.”\n“Indeed. Yet there are many among the Fused who think such Passions\nshould be denied to everyone but themselves. You might find Odium\nshockingly like one of us in this regard. Or perhaps instead we are like\nhim.” She nodded toward the mess of human scribes and Venli’s staff,\nworking in near-perpetual motion like a pile of cremlings feasting after the\nrain. “What do you think of this?”\n“If I had to guess, the human queen seems to be trying to make a mess.”\n“She’s creating ways to stall that won’t appear like purposeful\ninterference,” Raboniel said to Ridicule, though she seemed more amused\nthan angry. “She complains that she doesn’t have enough space, and"

Also, I suspect she’s trying to\nestablish a presence outside the room—even if just in this hallway—so that\nshe has a better chance of putting her people where they can overhear what\nwe’re saying. She seems to be getting more information than I expected;\nsome of her people might be able to speak my language.”\n“I find that difficult to believe, Lady of Wishes. From what I’ve been led\nto understand, it wasn’t but a year ago that they finally figured out how to\nread the Dawnchant.”\n“Yes, curious,” Raboniel said, smiling and speaking to Craving. “Tell\nme, Venli. Why is it you serve so eagerly after knowing what Odium did to\nyour people?”\nTimbre pulsed in worry, but Venli had already prepared an answer. “I\nknew that only the very best among us would earn his favor and reward.\nMost were simply not worthy.”\nRaboniel hummed softly, then nodded. She returned to her own work,\nstudying the shield around the pillar. “I’m waiting on reports of the\nPursuer’s sweep of the upper floors of the first tier. As well as news of his\nsearch for Radiants.”\n“I will go immediately and ask, Ancient One,” Venli said, stepping away.\n“Venli,” Raboniel said. “Many mortals in the past sought elevation to\nstand among the Fused. You should know that, after our initial elevation, he\nnever again granted such a lofty gift to a mortal.”\n“I … Thank you, Ancient One.” She hummed to Tribute and withdrew,\npicking her way through the increasingly cluttered hallway. Within her,\nTimbre pulsed to Amusement. She knew that Venli had no aspirations of\nbecoming a Fused.\n“Do not be so quick to laud me,” Venli whispered to the spren. “The\nperson I was not so long ago would have been thrilled by the possibility of\nbecoming immortal.”\nTimbre’s pulses seemed skeptical. But she hadn’t known Venli during\nthat time—and as well she hadn’t.\nAs Venli reached the end of the hallway, she was joined by Dul, the tall\nstormsetter who was in Venli’s inner group of singers. The ones she’d been\npromising, over the last year, that she would help escape the Fused.\nToday Dul wore mediationform, with an open face and smooth, beautiful\ncarapace. He had a mostly red skin pattern with tiny hints of black, like\nsubmerged rocks in a deep red sea. He fell into stride with Venli as they\nwalked out into the chamber with the stairs. As far as she knew, this large\nopen room—in the shape of a cylinder—was the sole way up from the\nbasement. They marched up the stairs that wound around the outside,\npassing over a section of hastily rebuilt steps, until they were far enough\nfrom others that no one would be able to overhear them.\nShe quickly checked Shadesmar.

Alavah and Ron are\ncovertly making packs of supplies that will be easy to grab and take if we\nneed them.”\n“Excellent,” Venli said.\n“I don’t know how we’ll escape without being spotted,” Dul said.\n“Everyone is on edge in this place, and they have guards watching carefully\noutside for Alethi scouts.”\n“Something is going to happen, Dul,” Venli said to Determination. “The\nhumans will try to revolt, or an attack will come, or perhaps that captive\nqueen will find a way to turn fabrials against the Fused.\n“When that happens, whatever it is, we’re going to be ready to run. I was\nled here through the mountains, and I memorized the route. We can sneak\nthrough those valleys, hiding from the Heavenly Ones in the tree cover.\nThere has to be some out-of-the-way location up here in these wilds where\na few dozen people can lose themselves to the world.”\nDul paused on the steps, and hummed to Hope. He nearly seemed to\nhave tears in his eyes.\n“Are you all right?” Venli asked, stopping beside him.\nHe hummed a little louder. “After all this time, I can taste it, Venli. An\nescape. A way out.”\n“Be careful,” she said. “We will need some kind of ploy to convince\neveryone we died, so they don’t search for us. And we have to be very\ncareful not to draw suspicion before that.”\n“Understood,” he said, then hummed to Tension. “We’ve had a problem\nwith Shumin, the new recruit.”\nShe hummed to Reprimand.\n“She tried recruiting others,” Dul explained. “She’s been implying she\nknows someone planning to start a rebellion against the Fused.”\nVenli hummed to Derision. She didn’t normally use Odium’s rhythms\nwith her friends, but it fit the situation too well.\nDul sighed like a human. “It’s the same old problem, Venli. The people\nwilling to listen to us are going to be a little unreliable—if they were fully\ncapable or smart, they wouldn’t dare keep secrets from the Fused.”\n“So what does that say about you and me?” Venli asked.\n“Pretty sure that was clearly implied,” Dul said with a grin, speaking to\nAmusement.\n“Isolate Shumin,” Venli said. “We don’t dare return her to Kholinar\nwithout supervision, but see if you can get her assigned to some kind of\nmenial task without much time to interact with others. And emphasize to\nher again that she’s not to recruit.”\n“Understood,” he said softly to Consolation. He glanced upward, along\nthe wide set of winding steps. “I hear the humans almost won here on these\nsteps. No Radiants, and they stood against Fused and Regals.”"

Before, they wouldn’t\nlet me and Mazish marry. One of the only times I spoke to my master was\nto make that request—a single word, with as much passion as I could\nmuster. He was angry that I dared talk to him. One storming word…”\nHe attracted an angerspren that prowled up the steps below him, like\nsparking lightning. Timbre pulsed morosely. Her kind had been treated\nsimilarly. Yet Venli found herself thinking about the fight on these steps.\nThey were valiant, these humans. Though you obviously had to be careful\nnot to let them get too much power over you.\n“When you get back to the others,” Venli said, continuing to climb, “put\na few of our people on the crews that are gathering and caring for the\nunconscious Knights Radiant. We should watch them for an opportunity,\njust in case.”\nShe had originally hoped they would be able to train her in her powers—\nbut that seemed impossible now.

She hoped she wasn’t causing Dul to sing\nhopeless songs; though she spoke to Confidence, she didn’t know whether\nthere would be a chance for them to escape in the coming weeks. And the\nmore time she spent with Raboniel, the more she worried. That Fused saw\nthings she shouldn’t be able to, piercing plots with keen eyes.\nEach day Venli’s people lived in secret was another chance for them to\nbe exposed, taken quietly in the night, and either executed or forced to\nbecome hosts for the Fused. They needed what she’d promised: to live on\ntheir own, as their own nation. Could she really provide that though? Venli,\nwho had never touched anything in her life without making a storm of it.\nShe had gotten one people destroyed already.\nTimbre pulsed consoling ideas as Venli made her way through the\ncorridors.\n“I wish I could believe, Timbre,” she said softly. “I really wish I could.\nBut you don’t know what you’re working with in me. You don’t\nunderstand.”\nTimbre pulsed, inquisitive. She wanted to know. Venli had long\nremained silent about the more difficult parts of her past.\nThe time to share them, however, was long overdue. “The worst of it\nbegan,” Venli whispered, “when the humans visited us the second time.…”\nEIGHT AND A HALF YEARS AGO"

She looked up from her place by the wall, where she was\nusing some paper—a gift from the humans—to play with letters and beats.\nRepresentations of sounds in a possible written language, like the humans\nused.\nHer mother stood by the window, doing her daily recitations. The same\ncalming songs, performed by the same beautiful voice that had been Venli’s\nguide all her days. The foundation upon which she’d built her life.\n“‘A delicate touch…’” Jaxlim began again. But again she faltered.\n“‘Nimbleform has a delicate touch,’” Venli prompted. “‘Gave the gods\nthis form to many…’”\nBut her mother didn’t continue singing. She stared out the window,\nsilent, not even humming. It was the second time this week she’d\ncompletely forgotten a stanza.\nVenli rose, setting aside her work and taking her mother’s hand. She\nattuned Praise, but didn’t know what to say.\n“I’m merely tired,” Jaxlim said. “From the stress of these strange days\nand their stranger visitors.” The humans had promised to return, and since\ntheir departure months ago, the family had been abuzz with different ideas\nof what to do about the strange creatures.\n“Go,” Jaxlim said. “Find your sister. She said she’d come listen to a\nrecitation, and at least learn the Song of Listing. I will get some sleep.\nThat’s what I need.”\nVenli helped her mother to the bed. Jaxlim had always seemed so strong,\nand indeed her body was fit and powerful. Yet she wobbled as she lay down,\nshaken. Not on the outside, but deep within.\nUntil recently, Jaxlim had never forgotten songs. To even suggest it\nwould have been unthinkable.\nOnce her mother was situated, Venli attuned Determination and stepped\nout of their home—not into a forest clearing, but into a city. One of the ten\nancient ones, surrounded by a broken wall and populated by the remnants of\nbuildings.\nFinding the humans had emboldened Venli’s family. Bearing newly\nbestowed weapons, they’d marched to the Shattered Plains and claimed a\nplace among the ten, defeating the family who had held it before them.\nOnce, Venli would have walked tall and proud at that victory.\nToday, she was too unsettled. She went searching, ignoring cries to Joy\nin greeting. Where was Eshonai? Surely she hadn’t gone off again, not\nwithout telling her sibling and mother.…\nFortunately, Venli found her at a scouting tower, built up along the\nbroken wall near the front gates of the city. Eshonai stood on the very top,\nwatching out to the northwest, the direction the humans had come from.\n“Venli!” she said, grabbing her arm and pulling her to the front of the\nflimsy wooden scout tower. “Look! That seems like smoke in the distance.\nFrom their campfires perhaps?”\nVenli looked down at the wobbly tower. Was this safe?"

Was this safe?\n“I’ve been thinking about what we can learn from them,” Eshonai said to\nExcitement. “Oh, it will feel so good to show them to the rest of the\nfamilies! That will stop everyone from doubting our word, won’t it? Seeing\nthe humans themselves!”\n“That will feel good,” Venli admitted. She knelt, holding to the wooden\nfloor while Eshonai stood up on her toes. Storms! It looked like she was\nabout to climb onto the railing.\n“What must their cities be like?” Eshonai said. “I think I will leave with\nthem this time. Travel the world. See it all!”\n“Eshonai, no!” Venli said. And the true panic in her rhythm made\nEshonai finally pause.\n“Sister?” she asked.\nVenli searched for the right words. To talk to Eshonai about their mother.\nAbout what … seemed to be happening. But she couldn’t confront it. It was\nas if by voicing her fears, she’d make them real. She wanted to pretend it\nwas nothing. As long as she could.\n“You were supposed to come today,” Venli said, “and listen to one of the\nsongs. Maybe learn one again.”\n“We have you and Mother for that,” Eshonai said, looking toward the\nhorizon. “I haven’t the mind for it.”\nBut I need you with me, Venli thought. With us. Together.\nI need my sister.\n“I’m going to lead a scout group to go investigate that smoke,” Eshonai\nsaid, moving toward the ladder. “Tell Mother for me, will you?”\nShe was gone before Venli could say anything. A day later, Eshonai came\nback triumphant. The humans had indeed returned.\n* * *\nIt didn’t take long for Venli to find the humans tedious.\nThough they’d barely noticed her on the first visit, this time they\nwouldn’t leave her alone. They wanted to hear the songs over and over. It\nwas so frustrating! They couldn’t replicate the songs if they did memorize\nthem—they couldn’t hear the rhythms.\nWorse, when she performed, the humans kept interrupting and asking for\nmore information, more explanations, more accurate translations.\nInfuriating, she thought, attuned to Irritation. She’d started to learn their\nlanguage because Jaxlim insisted, but it didn’t seem a good use of her time\nor her talents. The humans should learn her language.\nWhen they finally let her go for the day, she stepped out of the building\nand welcomed the sunlight. Sitting outside were three of those dull-minded,\nstupid “parshmen” who didn’t have songs. Seeing them made Venli\nuncomfortable.\nWas that what the humans thought she was like? Some simpleton? Some\nof her family tried to talk to the parshmen, but Venli stayed away. She\ndidn’t like how they made her feel. They weren’t her people, any more than\nthe humans were.\nShe scanned the bustling city, noting the crowds of listeners nearby. The\nhumans drew so many gawkers.

Listeners from many families—even lowly\nones who didn’t have a city—came to catch a glimpse. Lines of people of\nall varieties of skin patterns stuffed the streets, meaning that Venli was\ncrowded as she pushed through them.\n“They probably won’t come out for a while yet,” she said to Reprimand\nto a group of listeners she didn’t recognize.\n“You are the apprentice keeper of songs,” one of them said, “of the\nfamily who discovered the humans.” He said it to Awe, which made Venli\npause. So he knew of her, did he?\n“I am no apprentice,” she said. “I am simply waiting, as is respectful,\nupon my mother’s word before I take my place.”\nShe glanced back toward the building she’d left. Like many in the city, it\nwas made of ancient walls covered in crem, with a roof of carapace. The\nhumans had been allowed to make camp here, inside the walls, with their\ntents and their strange wooden vehicles that could withstand a storm. It\nseemed unfair that their moving structures should last better than the\nbuildings the listeners built.\n“I’ve spent many hours with them so far,” Venli said to Consideration.\n“What would you know of them? I can tell you.”\n“Do they really lack souls?” asked a female in mateform. Silly things.\nVenli intended to never adopt that form.\n“That’s one theory,” Venli said. “They can’t hear the rhythms, and they\nseem dull of speech and mind. Makes me wonder why they were so difficult\nfor our ancestors to fight.”\n“They work metal as if it were wax,” another said. “Look at that armor.”\n“Far less practical than carapace would be,” Venli said.\n“We don’t have carapace armor anymore,” another said.\nThat was true, of course; their current forms didn’t have much carapace.\nMost of what they knew about grander forms such as warform came from\nthe songs. And Venli, infuriatingly, hadn’t made progress in discovering that\none.\nStill, wouldn’t growing your own armor be much better than what the\nhumans did? Well, she answered a few more questions, though she wished\nfor the listeners to notice how tired she was from reciting songs all day.\nCouldn’t they at least have fetched her something to drink?\nEventually she moved on, and tried to push through her bad mood. She\nshould probably enjoy reciting songs for the humans—she did enjoy the\nmusic. But she didn’t miss that Jaxlim always had them come to Venli. Her\nmother didn’t want to be seen making a mistake by anyone, particularly not\nthese humans.\nDeep down, that was probably the real source of Venli’s irritation. The\nknot of worry that festered in her gut, making her feel helpless. And alone.\nNearby, on the street, listeners changed their rhythms. Venli suspected\nwhat it was before she turned and saw Eshonai striding down the street.\nEveryone knew her, of course. The one who had discovered the humans.\nVenli almost went to her. But why? There was never any comfort to be\nfound in her presence. Only more talk of the human world, their cities and"

And no talk of the real problems at home Eshonai continued\nto ignore.\nSo instead, Venli slipped between two small buildings and emerged onto\na street on the other side. Maybe she could go to the fields and see Demid.\nShe started that way … then stopped. No, they had decided not to show the\nhumans how they used Stormlight to grow plants. The songs cautioned that\nthis secret should not be shared. So they weren’t working the fields, and\nDemid wouldn’t be there.\nInstead Venli made her way down to the plateaus, where she could be\nalone. Just her and the lifespren. She attuned Peace to check the time, then\nsettled down and stared over the broken plateaus, trying to soothe her worry\nabout her mother. Worry that she would have to take over being keeper of\nsongs, as she’d claimed she was to those listeners—a boast that now\nseemed far too puffed up.\nVenli didn’t want to replace Jaxlim. She wanted to go back to the way\nthings had been before the humans arrived.\nThe moment she thought that, she saw a human female leave the city\nabove and come walking in her direction. Venli sighed. Couldn’t they leave\nher for one movement? Well, they all assumed she couldn’t speak their\nlanguage, and so she could play dumb. And … it wouldn’t require much\npretending. Their rhythmless dead language was hard to understand.\nThe female gestured for permission, then sat next to Venli. She was the\none with the rings on her exposed hand. Some kind of surgeon, Venli had\nbeen told. She didn’t seem important. Most everyone ignored her—she was\nbasically one of the servants.\n“It’s quite impressive, isn’t it?” the human said in the listener tongue,\nlooking over the Shattered Plains. “Something terrible must have happened\nhere. Doesn’t seem like those plateaus could have formed naturally.”\nVenli attuned Anxiety. The woman spoke the words without a rhythm,\nyes, but they were perfectly understandable.\n“How…” Venli said, then hummed to Betrayal.\n“Oh, I’ve always been good with languages,” the female said. “My name\nis Axindweth. Though few here know me by that name, I give it to you.”\n“Why?”\n“Because I think we’re going to be friends, Venli,” she said. “I’ve been\nsent to search out someone like you. Someone who remembers what your\npeople used to be. Someone who wants to restore the glory that you’ve\nlost.”\n“We are glorious,” Venli said, attuning Irritation and standing.\n“Glorious?” Axindweth said. “Living in crem huts? Making stone tools\nbecause you’ve forgotten how to forge metal? Living all your lives in two\nforms, when you used to have dozens?”\n“What do you know about any of this?” Venli said, turning to leave. Her\nmother would be very interested to hear one of the humans had been hiding\nthe ability to speak their language.\n“I know much about too many things,” the woman said. “Would you like\nto learn how to obtain a form of power, Venli?”"

They are dangerous. They let\nthe old gods control our ancestors.”\n“Isn’t it odd,” Axindweth said, “how much stock you put in what your\nancestors said? A dusty old group of people that you’ve never met? If you\ngathered a collection of listeners from the other families, would you let\nthem decide your future? That’s all they were, your ancient ancestors. A\nrandom group of people.”\n“Not random,” Venli said to Praise. “They had strength. They left their\ngods to find freedom.”\n“Yes,” Axindweth said. “I suppose they did.”\nVenli continued on her way. Stupid human.\n“There were forms of power that could heal someone, you know,” the\nhuman said idly.\nVenli froze in place. Then she spun, attuning Betrayal again. How did\nshe know about Venli’s mother?\n“Yes,” Axindweth said, toying with one of her rings, staring out away\nfrom Venli. “Great things were once possible for your people. Your\nancestors, the ones you revere, might have been brave. But have you ever\nasked yourself about the things they didn’t leave you in songs? Have you\nseen the holes in their stories? You bear the pain of their actions, living\nwithout forms for generations. Exiled. Shouldn’t you have the choices they\ndid, weighing forms of power against your current life?”\n“How do you know all these things?” Venli demanded, walking back.\n“How do you know about forms of power? Who are you?”\nThe woman removed something from within her covered sleeve. A\nsingle glowing gemstone. Blood red.\n“Take that into a storm,” the woman said. “And break it. Inside, you will\nfind a path toward saving those you love.”\nThe woman stood and left the gem sitting on the rock.\nI am led to wonder, from experiences such as this, if we have been\nwrong.

Raboniel thought the humans had\ndeliberately destroyed maps of the tower, so this group was making their\nown. Ruling this place was going to be a huge chore, one Venli was glad\nshe didn’t have to organize.\nThe singers here hummed to Praise as Venli entered, showing her\nrespect. Even the two relayform Regals gave deference to a Voice such as\nVenli. She asked for, and was given, a wide range of reports on the activities\nup here.\nEverything from the seventh floor up was unoccupied. Consequently,\nthey were setting up checkpoints at each stairwell on the sixth floor, worried\nthat panicked humans might try to hide on the many upper floors once\nconfinement to quarters was relaxed. And confinement to quarters would\nneed to be relaxed soon. The humans were running out of food and water.\nVenli suspected Raboniel would give the word for normal operations to\nrecommence by the end of the day.\nThey’d found a large number of unconscious Radiants, many of whom\nhad been in the homes of people trying to protect or hide them. Venli\nhummed to Derision as she scanned the list. The foolish people were lucky;\nRaboniel was more lenient than some Fused. She had ordered that anyone\nfound keeping Radiants would be punished, and the Radiants executed—\nbut that any Radiants revealed willingly would be spared.\nIt had been a wise move: many Radiants had been offered up after her\nannouncement. The few found later had been executed, along with one\nmember of each family hiding them. A stern but just application of the law.\nTimbre found it horrifying. Venli found it amazing Raboniel hadn’t\nexecuted them all.\nShe wants these Radiants for something, she thought. Something to do\nwith her plans, her experiments. Venli had not forgotten what had earned\nthe Lady of Wishes her terrible reputation: an attempt long ago to create a\ndisease that would end the war by exterminating all of humankind.\nWell, Venli might have her own use for these Radiants. She listened with\nhalf an ear to the reports, until the relayform said something that drew her\nfull attention.\n“Wait,” Venli said. “Repeat that?”\n“A human surgeon killed one of our number during the investigations the\nother night,” the malen said.\n“I haven’t heard of this,” Venli said.\n“We reported it at the time, and a Fused took charge immediately, so we\nassumed it had gotten back to Raboniel. This human took an unconscious\nWindrunner with him when he fled.”\n“Which Fused did you report this to?”\n“The Pursuer.”\nTimbre pulsed worryingly.\n“Do we have a description of this human surgeon?” Venli asked.\n“Tall male,” the Regal said. “Shoulder-length wavy hair. Slave brands.\nThe soldier who witnessed the event claimed the human was glowing with\nStormlight, but we suspect our soldier was merely rattled. He proved to be a\ncoward, and has been assigned to waste detail.”\nVenli hummed to Thoughtfulness, though she felt a mounting dread.\nKaladin Stormblessed was in the tower; he hadn’t gone with the main bulk"

And he was … somehow still conscious?\nLeshwi would want to know that. She had asked Venli to watch over\nRaboniel specifically, but surely this was a matter deserving of her true\nmaster’s attention.\n“I see,” Venli said to Thoughtfulness. “Has this human been found?”\n“He fled to the upper floors,” the Regal explained to Spite. “We searched\nand found nothing—even the Pursuer, who was certain the human was\nclose, was unable to locate him.”\n“The Lady of Wishes will find this interesting,” Venli said. “Send me\nword if anything more is discovered.”\nThe Regal hummed to Command in acknowledgment, then gave Venli a\nlist with descriptions of all the other Radiants surrendered to this group.\nRaboniel wanted them kept all in one room, being watched. Venli would\nhave to put her people to work looking for a suitable location.\nOne conscious Windrunner, when all the others remained unconscious.\nYes, she’d find a way to send a note about this to Leshwi. “The singer who\nsaw the human kill our soldier,” Venli said, moving to leave. “Give me his\nname and station. The Lady of Wishes may want me to interrogate him.”\nThe Regal hummed to Derision. “The coward won’t be able to tell you\nmuch. If the Lady of Wishes is truly interested in this murderous human,\nshe should wait until this evening for another report.”\n“Why?”\n“By then the Pursuer will have interrogated the human’s family,” the\nRegal said. “And will have exacted revenge for the death of our soldier.”\nThe rhythms went silent. Timbre, hidden deep within Venli’s gemheart,\nseemed to be holding her breath.\n“We captured them, then?” Venli said.\n“They’re locked in the clinic a short way from here,” the Regal said to\nCraving. “A surgeon, his wife, one child. We only now discovered they are\nthe murderous human’s family. It’s a pity the Lady of Wishes has ordered us\nto be so tame during this occupation, but at least we’ll get a little blood\ntonight.”\nVenli tried to hum to Conceit as she left, but found nothing. No rhythms\nat all—it was unnerving. She shoved the list of descriptions in her pocket,\nand as soon as she was a short way from the scout post she hissed, “What\nare you doing?”\nTimbre pulsed, and the rhythms slowly returned. Venli relaxed. For a\nmoment she’d worried something was wrong.\nTimbre pulsed morosely. To her, something was wrong.\n“I agree that it’s unfortunate about the Windrunner’s family,” Venli said.\n“But at the same time, their son was involved in killing one of our troops.”\nTimbre pulsed again.\n“I suppose they aren’t our troops,” Venli agreed. “But why do you care\nso much? Don’t you hate humans?”\nThat drew a sharp rebuke. Just because Timbre and the other Reachers\nhad decided not to bond humans any longer, it didn’t mean she hated them."

Just because Timbre and the other Reachers\nhad decided not to bond humans any longer, it didn’t mean she hated them.\nAnd killing someone’s family because they resisted? That was terrible.\nMany Fused wouldn’t take that step, but the Pursuer—and his troops …\nwell, she’d heard the bloodthirst in that relayform’s rhythms.\nVenli walked in silence, troubled. She had her own business to see to, her\nown problems. Yet Timbre continued to pulse softly, urging her. Venli had\nseen the Blackthorn once in a vision. The Bondsmith. He’d shown her\nkindness. And so many of the humans of this tower, they were just people\ntrying to live their lives.\nEshonai would have done something.\n“I’m a fraud, Timbre,” Venli whispered. “A fake Radiant. I don’t know\nwhat I’m doing.”\nTimbre pulsed. The meaning was clear.\nI do.\nIt was enough. Venli turned and started down the steps, picking up speed\nas she went. There wasn’t much Venli could do directly to help the family.\nHer authority as Voice certainly wouldn’t extend to countering the will of\nthe Pursuer.\nInstead she made her way to the majestic atrium of the tower. This\nenormous opening far within the tower reminded her of the shaft that led to\nthe basement—a circular breach in the stone. Only this was on a far grander\nscale, over a hundred feet wide. It stretched tall, high into the darkness\nabove, and seemed to reach all the way to the very top.\nLifts ran up and down the inside of the atrium, though they needed\nVoidlight to work now. The far wall—pointed directly east—was not stone,\nbut instead a flat glass window. Amazingly large, it showed snow-covered\npeaks and provided natural light to the entire atrium.\nThe lifts were barely in use, as the singers were focused on establishing\ncontrol of the lower floors. To avoid alerting human Windrunner scouts, the\nshanay-im were forbidden from soaring around outside. They’d taken up\nresidence here instead, within this grand hall, hovering in the open air. Venli\nused her authority to commandeer a lift, then made her way up to the\nfifteenth floor. Here she found Leshwi meditating with her long clothing\ndrifting beneath her, with only two servants to see to her needs. She’d\ndonated the others to Raboniel.\nLeshwi noticed Venli immediately, cracking an eye. Venli sent the two\nservants away and hummed to Craving, standing patiently and waiting for\nher mistress to formally acknowledge her. Leshwi drifted over to the\nbalcony and rested one hand on the railing.\nVenli approached quickly, humming to Tribute.\n“Why have you not approached in secret, as I explained?” Leshwi\ndemanded.\nLeshwi had set up a method for Venli to clandestinely deliver notes\nabout Raboniel. Venli found the whole thing a baffling part of Fused\npolitics. Raboniel knew that Venli was spying, and Leshwi knew that\nRaboniel knew, yet they both pretended the subterfuge was unknown.\n“The Windrunner you wish to defeat is here in the tower,” Venli said,"

He has given them the spear by which to impale him.

Her\npowers normally let her understand anything her mistress said or implied.\nThere was something familiar about that rhythm though.\n“It is rare to find a human who can fight in the skies well enough to be a\nchallenge for me,” Leshwi said. “And his spren … I hear she is ancient.…\nBut never mind that. You will not raise this matter with me again.”\nTimbre pulsed, indicating Venli should tell her mistress. About them.\nAbout being Radiant.\nStupidity. Venli immediately shied back at the idea. Leshwi would kill\nher.\n“Is there something else?” Leshwi said to Command.\n“Stormblessed’s family is being held by the Pursuer’s guards,” Venli\nsaid. “They are on the sixth floor, in a clinic at the perimeter, near the main\ncorridor. The Pursuer plans to interrogate them, and I fear it will turn ugly.\nMany of his troops are angry they were forbidden to kill during the\nincursion. They are … excitable.”\n“Violent and bloodthirsty, you mean.”\n“Yes, Ancient One. The … the family of the Windrunner would be an\nexcellent resource for us, mistress. If you wish to find him before the\nPursuer, then perhaps holding them would give us an advantage.”\nLeshwi hummed to Thoughtfulness. “You are merciful, Venli. Do not\nreveal this Passion to others.

He did like playing at greatshell\nhunts, though he didn’t laugh during them like other children would. He\ntreated even play as a somber occasion.\nDalinar tried to restart the pretend hunt, but the boy’s mind seemed\novershadowed by these dark thoughts. After just another few minutes, Gav\ncomplained that he was tired. So Dalinar let his nursemaid take him to rest.\nThen Dalinar lingered at the doorway, watching her tuck him into bed.\nWhat five-year-old wanted to go to bed? Though Dalinar had not been\nthe most dutiful parent, he did remember lengthy complaints from both\nAdolin and Renarin on evenings like this, when they insisted they were old\nenough to stay up and they did not feel tired. Gav instead clutched his little\nwooden sword, which he kept with him at all times, and drifted off.\nDalinar left the small home, nodding to the guards outside. The Azish\nthought it strange that the Alethi officers brought families to war, but how\nelse were children to learn proper military protocol?\nIt was the evening following Jasnah’s stunt with Ruthar, and Dalinar had\nspent most of the day—before visiting Gav—speaking via spanreed to\nhighlords and highladies, smoothing over their concerns about the near\nexecution. He’d made certain the legality of Jasnah’s actions would not be\nquestioned. And he’d personally talked to Relis, Ruthar’s son.\nThe young man had lost a bout to Adolin back in the warcamps, and\nDalinar had worried about his motivations now. However, it seemed that\nRelis was eager to prove he could be a loyalist. Dalinar had made certain\nthat his father was taken to Azimir and given a small house there, where he\ncould be watched. Regardless of what Jasnah said, Dalinar wouldn’t have a\nformer highprince begging for scraps.\nFinally—after smoothing things over with the Azish, who did not\nappreciate Alethi trials by sword—he was feeling he had the situation under\ncontrol. He stopped in the middle of the camp, thoughtful. He’d almost\nforgotten Renarin’s talk of his episode the day before.\nDalinar turned and strode through the warcamp—a bustling illustration\nof organized chaos. Messengers ran this way and that, mostly wearing the\npatterned livery of the various Azish scribe orders. Alethi captains had their\nsoldiers hauling supplies or marking the stone ground with painted lines to\nindicate directions.\nA trail of wagons snaked in from the northwest, a lifeline to populated\nlands and fertile hills untouched by war. Fearing that this camp was already\na big target, Dalinar had posted many of his Soulcasters in Azimir.\nThe landscape was different from what he knew. More trees, less grass,\nand strange fields of shrubs with interlocking branches that created vast\nsnarls. Despite that, the signs he saw in this village were all too familiar.

        "text": "bit of cloth trapped in the hardened crem beside the roadway. Burnt-out\nbuildings, torched either out of a sadistic amusement, or to deny beds and\nstormshutters to the army that had moved in next. Those fires had been fed\nby homes with too many possessions left behind.\nEngineers had continued to shore up the eastern stormwall, where a\nnatural windbreak created a cleft. Normally this shoring process would have\ntaken weeks. Today Shardbearers cut out stone blocks, which Windrunners\nmade light enough to push into position with ease. The ever-present Azish\nfunctionaries were supervising.\nDalinar turned toward the Windrunner camp, troubled. Jasnah’s stunt had\novershadowed their conversation about monarchs and monarchies—but\nnow that he dwelled on it, he found it as disturbing as the duel. The way\nJasnah had talked … She had seemed proud of the idea that she might be\nAlethkar’s last queen. She intended to see Alethkar left with some version\nof a neutered monarchy, like in Thaylenah or Azir.\nHow would the country function without a proper monarch? The Alethi\nweren’t like these persnickety Azish. The Alethi liked real leaders, soldiers\nwho were accustomed to making decisions. A country was like an army.\nSomeone strong needed to be in charge. And barring that, someone decisive\nneeded to be in charge.\nThe thoughts persisted as he neared the Windrunner camp and smelled\nsomething delicious on the air. The Windrunners continued a tradition\nbegun in the bridge crews: a large communal stew available to anyone.\nDalinar had originally tried to regulate the thing. However, while he usually\nfound the Windrunners agreeable to proper military decorum, they had\nabsolutely refused to follow proper quartermaster requisition and mess\nrequirements for their evening stews.\nEventually Dalinar had done what any good commander did when faced\nby such persistent mass insubordination: He backed down. When good men\ndisobeyed, it was time to look at your orders.\nToday he found the Windrunners visited by an unusual number of\nThaylens. The stews tended to attract whichever soldiers felt most out of\nplace, and Dalinar suspected the Thaylens were feeling that way, being so\nfar from the oceans. Companylord Sigzil was taking a turn at storytelling.\nRenarin was there too in his Bridge Four uniform, watching Sigzil with rapt\nattention. Regardless of war or storm, the boy tried to find his way to this\nfire every evening.\nDalinar approached, and only then did he realize the stir he was causing.\nSoldiers nudged one another, and someone ran to get him a stool. Sigzil\npaused in his story, saluting smartly.\nThey think I’ve come to approve of the tradition, Dalinar realized. They\nseemed to have been waiting for it, judging by how eagerly one of the\nWindrunner squires brought him a bowl. Dalinar accepted the food and took\na bite, then nodded approvingly. That inspired applause. After that, there\nwas nothing to do but settle down and keep eating, indicating that the rest of\nthem could go on with their ritual.\nWhen he glanced over at his son, Renarin was smiling.

However, the lad didn’t have his box\nout, the one he often used to occupy his hands. He was relaxed here among\nthese people.\n“That was good of you, Father,” Renarin whispered, moving closer.\n“They’ve been waiting for you to stop by.”\n“It’s good stew,” Dalinar noted.\n“Secret Horneater recipe,” Renarin said. “Apparently it has only two\nlines of instructions. ‘Take everything you have, and put him in pot. Don’t\nlet anyone airsick touch seasonings.’” Renarin said it fondly, but he hadn’t\nfinished his bowl. He seemed distracted. Though … he always seemed\ndistracted. “I assume you’re here to talk about … what I told you? The\nepisode?”\nDalinar nodded.\nRenarin tapped his spoon against the side of his bowl, a rhythmic click.\nHe stared at the cookfire flamespren. “Does it strike you as cruel of fate,\nFather? My blood sickness gets healed, so I can finally be a soldier like I\nalways wanted. But that same healing has given me another kind of fit.\nMore dangerous than the other by far.”\n“What did you see this time?”\n“I’m not sure I should say. I know I told you to come talk to me, but … I\nvacillate. The things I see, they’re of him, right? I think he shows me what\nhe wants. That’s why I saw you becoming his champion.” He glanced down\nat his bowl. “Glys isn’t convinced the visions are bad. He says we’re\nsomething new, and he doesn’t think the visions are specifically from\nOdium—though perhaps his desires taint what we see.”\n“Any information—even if you suspect your enemy is feeding it to you\n—is useful, son. More wars are lost to lack of information than are lost to\nlack of courage.”\nRenarin set his bowl beside his seat. It was easy to fall into the habit of\nunderestimating Renarin. He always moved in this deliberate, careful way.\nIt made him seem fragile.\nDon’t forget, part of Dalinar thought. When you were broken on the floor,\nconsumed by your past, this boy held you. Don’t forget who was strong,\nwhen you—the Blackthorn—were weak.\nThe youth stood up, then gestured for Dalinar to follow. They left the\ncircle of firelight, waving farewell to the others. Lopen called out, asking\nRenarin to “look into the future and find out if I beat Huio at cards\ntomorrow.” It seemed a little crass to Dalinar, bringing up his son’s strange\ndisorder, but Renarin took it with a chuckle.\nThe sky had grown dim, though the sun wasn’t fully set yet. These\nwestern lands were warmer than Dalinar liked—particularly at night. They\ndidn’t cool off as was proper.\nThe Windrunner camp was near the edge of the village, so they strolled\nout into the wilderness near some snarls of bushes and a few tall trees—\nwith broad canopies—that had grown out of the center, perhaps somehow\nusing the bushes for extra strength. This area was relatively quiet, and soon\nthe two of them were alone."

This area was relatively quiet, and soon\nthe two of them were alone.\n“Renarin?” Dalinar asked. “Are you going to tell me what you saw?”\nHis son slowed. His eyes caught the light of the now-distant campfire.\n“Yes,” he said. “But I want to get it right, Father. So I need to summon it\nagain.”\n“You can summon it?” Dalinar said. “I thought it came upon you\nunexpectedly.”\n“It did,” Renarin said. “And it will again. But right now, it simply is.” He\nturned forward and stepped into the darkness.\n* * *\nAs Renarin stepped forward, the ground beneath his feet became dark glass,\nspreading from the heel of his boot. It cracked in a web of lines, a\npurposeful pattern, black on black.\nGlys, who preferred to hide within Renarin, grew excited. He’d captured\nthis vision as it came, so they could study it. Renarin wasn’t quite so\nenthusiastic. It would be so much easier if he were like other Radiants.\nStained glass spread out around him, engulfing the landscape, a phantom\nlight shimmering and glowing from behind in the darkness. As he walked,\neach of his footsteps made the ground pulse red, light shining up through\nthe cracks. His father wouldn’t be able to see what he did. But hopefully\nRenarin could describe it properly.\n“I see you in this vision,” Renarin said to his father. “You’re in a lot of\nthem. In this one you stand tall, formed as if from stained glass, and you\nwear Shardplate. Stark white Shardplate, though you are pierced with a\nblack arrow.”\n“Do you know what it means?” Dalinar said, a shadow barely visible\nfrom behind the glass window depicting him.\n“I think it might be a symbol of you, who you were, who you become.\nThe more important part is the enemy. He makes up the bulk of this image.\nA window of yellow-white light breaking into smaller and smaller pieces,\ninto infinity.\n“He is like the sun, Father. He controls and dominates everything—and\nalthough your figure raises a sword high, it’s facing the wrong direction.\nYou’re fighting and you’re fighting, but not him. I think I understand the\nmeaning: you want a deal, you want a contest of champions, but you’re\ngoing to keep fighting, and fighting, and fighting distractions. Because why\nwould the enemy agree to a contest that he can theoretically lose?”\n“He already agreed,” Dalinar said.\n“Were terms set?” Renarin asked. “A date picked? I don’t know if this\nvision is what he wants us to see. But either way … I don’t think he’s\nworried enough to agree to terms. He can wait, keep you fighting, keep us\nfighting. Forever. He can make this war so it never ends.”\nDalinar stepped forward, passing through the stained glass that\nrepresented him—though he wouldn’t know he had done so.\nIt seemed to Renarin as if his father never aged. Even in his earliest\nmemories, Renarin remembered him looking like this—so powerful, so\nunchanging, so strong. Some of that was from the things his mother had"

Some of that was from the things his mother had\ntold Renarin, building an image in his head of the perfect Alethi officer.\nIt was a tragedy that she hadn’t lived to see Dalinar become the man\nshe’d imagined him to be. A shame that Odium had seen her killed. That\nwas the way Renarin had to present it to himself. Better to turn his pain\nagainst the enemy than to lose his father along with his mother.\n“I have stared Odium in the eyes,” Dalinar said. “I have faced him. He\nexpected me to break. By refusing, I’ve upended his plans. It means he can\nbe defeated—and equally important, it means he doesn’t know everything\nor see everything.”\n“Yes,” Renarin said, walking across broken glass to look up at the\nenormous depiction of Odium. “I don’t think he’s omnipresent, Father.\nWell, part of him is everywhere, but he can’t access that information—any\nmore than the Stormfather knows everything the wind touches. I think …\nOdium might see like I do. Not events, or the world itself, but possibilities.\n“This war is dangerous for us, Father. In the past, the Heralds would\norganize our forces, fight with us for a time—but would then return to lock\naway the souls of the Fused in Damnation, preventing their rebirths. That\nway, each Fused we killed was an actual casualty. But the Oathpact is\nbroken now, and the Fused cannot be locked away.”\n“Yes…” Dalinar said, moving to stand beside Renarin. “I’ve been\nthinking about this myself. Trying to determine if there was a way to restore\nthe Oathpact, or to somehow otherwise make the enemy fear. This is new\nground, for both us and Odium. There must be something about this new\nreality that unnerves him. Is there anything else you see?”\nSee the blackness that will be, Renarin? Glys said.\n“Friction between the two of you,” Renarin said, pointing up at the\nstained glass. “And a blackness interfering, marring the beauty of the\nwindow. Like a sickness infecting both of you, at the edges.”\n“Curious,” Dalinar said, looking where Renarin had pointed, though he’d\nsee only empty air. “I wonder if we’ll ever know what that represents.”\n“Oh, that one’s easy, Father,” Renarin said. “That’s me.”\n“Renarin, I don’t think you should see yourself as—”\n“You needn’t try to protect my ego, Father. When Glys and I bonded, we\nbecame … something new. We see the future. At first I was confused at my\nplace—but I’ve come to understand. What I see interferes with Odium’s\nability. Because I can see possibilities of the future, my knowledge changes\nwhat I will do. Therefore, his ability to see my future is obscured. Anyone\nclose to me is difficult for him to read.”\n“I find that comforting,” Dalinar said, putting his arm around Renarin’s\nshoulders. “Whatever you are, son, it’s a blessing. You might be a different"

You might be a different\nkind of Radiant, but you’re Radiant all the same. You shouldn’t feel you\nneed to hide this or your spren.”\nRenarin ducked his head, embarrassed. His father knew not to touch him\ntoo quickly, too unexpectedly, so it wasn’t the arm around his shoulders. It\nwas just that … well, Dalinar was so accustomed to being able to do\nwhatever he wanted. He had written a storming book.\nRenarin held no illusions that he would be similarly accepted. He and his\nfather might be of similar rank, from the same family, but Renarin had\nnever been able to navigate society like Dalinar did. True, his father at times\n“navigated” society like a chull marching through a crowd, but people got\nout of the way all the same.\nNot for Renarin. The people of both Alethkar and Azir had thousands of\nyears training them to fear and condemn anyone who claimed to be able to\nsee the future. They weren’t going to put that aside easily, and particularly\nnot for Renarin.\nWe will be careful, Glys thought. We will be safe.\nWe will try, Renarin thought to him.\nOut loud, he merely said, “Thank you. It means a lot to me that you\nbelieve that, Father.”\nYou will ask him? Glys said. So my siblings can be?\n“Glys wants me to note,” Renarin said, “that there are others like him.\nOther spren that Sja-anat has touched, changed, made into … whatever it is\nwe are.”\n“What she does is not right. Corrupting spren?”\n“If I’m a blessing, Father, how can we reject the others? How can we\ncondemn the one who made them? Sja-anat isn’t human, and doesn’t think\nlike one, but I believe she is trying to find a path toward peace between\nsingers and humans. In her own way.”\n“Still … I’ve felt the touch of one of the Unmade, Renarin.”\nAnd by one, you judge the others? Renarin didn’t say it though. People\ntoo often said things as soon as they popped into their heads. Instead he\nwaited.\n“How many corrupted spren are we talking about?” Dalinar finally\nasked.\n“Only a handful,” Renarin said. “She won’t change intelligent spren\nwithout their consent.”\n“Well, that’s valuable to know. I’ll consider it. Are you … in contact\nwith her?”\n“Not in months. Glys is worried at how silent she’s become, though he\nthinks she is somewhere near right now.”\nShe creates in us a faction loved by neither men nor Odium, Glys agreed.\nNo home. No allies. She might be destroyed by either. We will need more.\nLike you and like me. Together.\nAround Renarin, the stained glass windows began to crumble. It took\nStormlight and effort by Glys to re-create them—and he was plainly getting\ntired. Gradually, Renarin’s world became normal.\n“Let me know if she contacts you,” Dalinar said. “And if any of these"

A stone shelf along one wall\ngave him a place to put Teft. He’d washed the man, then dressed him in the\nloose robe, with bedpan in place. One of the sacks Kaladin had taken from\nthe monastery—stuffed with clothing—made a makeshift pillow. He’d need\nto find blankets, but for now his friend seemed as comfortable as Kaladin\ncould make him.\nTeft was still willing to take water, sucking it from the large metal\nsyringe Kaladin brought back. Indeed, Teft lapped up the contents eagerly.\nHe seemed so close to coming awake, Kaladin expected him to start cursing\nat any moment, demanding to know where his uniform had gone.\nSyl watched, uncharacteristically solemn. “What will we do if he dies?”\nshe asked softly.\n“Don’t think about that,” Kaladin said.\n“What if I can’t help thinking about it?”\n“Find something to distract you.”\nShe sat on the stone shelf, hands in her lap. “Is that how you stand it?\nKnowing everyone is going to die? You just … don’t think about it?”\n“Basically,” Kaladin said, refilling his syringe from the wooden water\njug, then putting the tip into Teft’s mouth and slowly emptying it.\n“Everyone dies eventually.”\n“I won’t,” she said. “Spren are immortal, even if you kill them. Someday\nI’ll have to watch you die.”\n“What brought this on?” Kaladin asked. “This isn’t like you.”\n“Yup. Right. Of course. Not like me.” She plastered a smile on her face.\n“Sorry.”\n“I didn’t mean it that way, Syl,” Kaladin said. “You don’t have to\npretend.”\n“I’m not.”\n“I’ve used enough fake smiles to not be fooled by one. You were doing\nthis earlier too, before the problems in the tower started. What happened?”\nShe looked down. “I’ve … been remembering what it was like when\nRelador, my old knight, died. How it made me sleep for so many years,\nstraight through the Recreance.

And at the same time a crippling—and\nbaffling—impulse pushing you to give up and do nothing to change it?”\n“No,” she said, shaking her head. “Nothing like that. Just a worry in the\nback of my mind that I keep circling around to. Like … I have a present I\nwant to open, and I get excited for a little while—only to remember I\nalready opened it and there was nothing inside.”\n“Sounds like how I used to feel when I remembered Tien was dead,”\nKaladin said. “I’d get used to living life as normal, feeling good—only to\nbe reminded by seeing a rock in the rain, or by seeing a wooden carving\nlike the ones he used to do. Then my whole day would come crashing\ndown.”\n“Like that! But it doesn’t crash my day down. Just makes me settle back\nand think and wish I could see him again. It still hurts. Is something wrong\nwith me?”\n“That sounds normal to me. Healthy. You’re dealing with the loss when\nyou never really did so before. Now that you’re coming fully back to\nyourself, you’re finally confronting things you’ve been ignoring.”\n“You just told me not to think about it though,” Syl said. “Will that\nactually help?”\nKaladin winced. No, it wouldn’t. He’d tried. “Distractions can be\nhelpful. Doing something, reminding yourself there’s a lot out there that’s\nwonderful. But … you do have to think about these things eventually, I\nguess.” He filled the syringe again. “You shouldn’t ask me about this sort of\nproblem. I’m … not the best at dealing with them myself.”\n“I feel like I shouldn’t have to deal with them,” Syl said. “I’m a spren,\nnot a human. If I’m thinking like this, doesn’t it mean I’m broken?”\n“It means you’re alive,” Kaladin said. “I’d be more worried if you didn’t\nfeel loss.”\n“Maybe it’s because you humans created us.”\n“Or it’s because you’re a little piece of divinity, like you always say.”\nKaladin shrugged. “If there is a god, then I think we could find him in the\nway we care about one another. Humans thinking about the wind, and\nhonor, might have given you shape from formless power—but you’re your\nown person now. As I’m my own person, though my parents gave me\nshape.”\nShe smiled at that, and walked across the shelf wearing the form of a\nwoman in a havah. “A person,” she said. “I like thinking like that. Being\nlike that. A lot of the other honorspren, they talk about what we were made\nto be, what we must do. I talked like that once. I was wrong.”\n“A lot of humans are the same,” he said, leaning down so he was eye\nlevel with her. “I guess we both need to remember that whatever’s\nhappening in our heads, whatever it was that created us, we get to choose.\nThat’s what makes us people, Syl.”\nShe smiled, then her havah bled from a light white-blue to a deeper blue\ncolor, striking and distinct, like it was made of real cloth."

Kaladin finished giving Teft\nthe syringe of water, then held it up. The sides of the metal had fingerprints\nin them, sunken into the surface. This device had been Soulcast into metal\nafter first being formed from wax—the fingerprints were a telltale sign.\n“You can become more things,” he said. “Like a syringe maybe? We\ntalked about you becoming other tools.”\n“I think I could do it,” she said. “If I could manifest as a Blade right\nnow, I could change shape to be like that. I think … you imagining it, me\nbelieving it, we could do even more. It—”\nShe cut off as a faint scraping sounded outside, from near the doorway.\nImmediately Kaladin reached for his scalpel. Syl came alert, zipping up into\nthe air around him as a ribbon of light. Kaladin crept toward the door. He’d\ncovered up the gemstone in the wall on this side with a piece of cloth. He\ndidn’t know if his light would shine out or not, but wasn’t taking any\nchances.\nBut he could hear. Someone was out there, their boots scraping stone.\nWere they inspecting the door?\nHe made a snap decision, slipping his hand under the cloth and pressing\nit against the stone, commanding it to open. The rocks began to split.\nKaladin prepared to leap out and attack the singer on the other side.\nBut it wasn’t a singer.\nIt was Dabbid.\nThe unassuming bridgeman wore street clothing, and he stepped away\nfrom the door as it opened. He saw Kaladin and nodded to him, as if this\nwere all completely expected.\n“Dabbid?” Kaladin said. Other than Rlain, Dabbid was the only original\nbridgeman who hadn’t manifested Windrunner powers. So it made sense he\nwas awake. But how had he found his way here?\nDabbid held up a pot with something liquid inside. Kaladin gave it a\nsniff. “Broth?” he asked. “How did you know?”\nDabbid pointed at the line of crystal on the wall, where the tower spren’s\nlight began to twinkle. Surprising; along with being mute, the man didn’t\noften volunteer information.\nHolding the pot awkwardly, Dabbid tapped his wrists together. Bridge\nFour.\n“I am so glad to see you,” Kaladin said, leading him into the room.\n“How did you get broth? Never mind. Here, come sit by Teft.” Dabbid was\none of the first men Kaladin had saved when he’d started administering\nmedical aid to the bridgemen.

These days, I must\nsimply leave a given door so it can be opened by anyone, or lock it so none\ncan open it.\nWell, it was good to know that—in a pinch—he should be able to ask the\nSibling to lock the door. For now, it was enough that Dabbid could get in\nand out.\nKaladin nodded to Syl, left one gemstone to give Dabbid light, then\nslipped out.\n* * *\nNavani had asked Kaladin to observe the Oathgates up close as they were\nactivated. To see if he could figure out why they functioned when other\nfabrials did not.\nUnfortunately, Kaladin doubted he’d be able to get all the way down to\nthe Oathgate plateau by sneaking through the hallways of the tower. He had\nmade it to an out-of-the-way monastery on the fourth floor, yes, but that\nwas a long way from the highly populated first two floors. Even if humans\nweren’t confined to quarters, Kaladin couldn’t saunter along without getting\nstopped. Kaladin Stormblessed drew attention.\nInstead, he wanted to try climbing along the outside of the tower. Before\nhe’d learned to fly, he’d stuck rocks to the chasm wall and climbed them.\nHe figured he could do something similar now. The enemy had plainly\nordered the Heavenly Ones to stay inside, and few people went out on the\nbalconies.\nSo he made his way onto a balcony on the tenth floor right as dusk was\narriving. He’d tied a sack to his belt, and in it he’d stuffed the four scrub\nbrushes he’d gotten from the monastery. Earlier, he’d cut the bristles free\nwith his scalpel, leaving them flat on the front but with a curved handle for\nholding.\nKaladin couldn’t paint his hands with a Full Lashing to stick them to\nthings. Lopen kept sticking his clothing or hair to the floor, but a Radiant’s\nskin seemed immune to the power. Perhaps Kaladin could have rigged some\ngloves that worked, but the brush handholds seemed sturdier."

Perhaps Kaladin could have rigged some\ngloves that worked, but the brush handholds seemed sturdier.\nHe leaned out of the balcony and checked to see if anyone was watching.\nIt was growing dark already. He doubted anyone would be able to see him\nin the gloom, so long as he didn’t draw in too much Stormlight. By keeping\nit mostly in the brushes attached to the wall, he wouldn’t glow so much that\nhe risked being spotted. At least, the risk of that felt far less than the risk of\nsneaking through the occupied floors.\nBest to try it first in a way that wasn’t dangerous. Kaladin took out one\nof the brushes and infused it with Stormlight, then pressed the flat side\nagainst a pillar on the balcony. With it affixed in place, he was able to hang\nhis entire weight on it—dangling free—without it pulling off or the handle\nbreaking.\n“Good enough,” he said, recovering the Stormlight from the Lashing. He\ntook off his socks, but replaced his boots. He scanned the air for Heavenly\nOnes one last time, then stepped over the side of the balcony and balanced\non the little ledge outside. He looked down toward the stones far below, but\nthey were lost in the evening darkness. He felt as if he were standing on the\nedge of eternity.\nHe’d always liked being up high. Even before becoming Radiant, he’d\nfelt a certain kinship with the open sky. Standing here, part of him wanted\nto jump, to feel the rushing wind. It wasn’t some suicidal tendency, not this\ntime. It was the call of something beautiful.\n“Are you scared?” Syl said.\n“No,” Kaladin said. “The opposite. I’ve gotten so accustomed to leaping\nfrom high places that I’m not nearly as worried about this as I probably\nshould be.”\nHe infused two of the brushes, then moved to the far left side of the\nbalcony. Here the stone wall made a straight “path” toward the ground\nbetween balconies. Kaladin took a deep breath and swung out and slammed\none brush against the stone, then the other.\nHe found footholds on the stone, but they were slippery. Once, there had\nbeen a great deal of ornamentation on the rock out here—but years of\nhighstorms had smoothed some of that out. Perhaps Lift could have climbed\nit without help, but Kaladin was glad he had Stormlight. He infused the toes\nof his boots through his feet, then stuck them to the wall too.\nHe started toward the ground, unsticking one limb, moving it, then\nsticking it back. Syl walked through the air beside him, as if striding down\ninvisible steps. Kaladin found the descent more difficult than he’d\nanticipated. He had to rely a great deal on his upper-body strength, as it was\ndifficult to get the boots to stick right, with just the toes.\nHe’d release one brush from the wall, then slide it into place while\nholding on with only one hand, then move his feet before moving the other.\nThough Radiant, he was sweating from exertion by the time he reached the\nfifth floor. He decided to take a break, and—after having Syl check to make\nsure it was empty—he moved over and swung onto a balcony. He settled"

He settled\ndown, breathing deeply, a few spiky coldspren moving across the balcony\nrail toward him, like friendly cremlings.\nSyl darted into the hallway to make sure nobody was near. Fortunately,\nthe increasingly cold tower—and the desire for subterfuge—seemed to have\nconvinced most of the invading singers to take quarters far inward. So long\nas he stayed away from patrols, he should be safe.\nHe sat with his back to the balcony railing, feeling his muscles burn. As\na soldier, then a bridgeman, he’d grown accustomed to the sensation of\noverexerted muscles. He almost felt cheated these days, because\nStormlight’s healing made the feeling rare. Indeed, after he sat for a minute,\nthe sensation was completely gone.\nOnce Syl returned, he resumed his climb. As he did, a couple of\nwindspren drew near: little lines of light that looped about him. As he\ndescended toward the fourth floor, they would occasionally show faces at\nhim—or the outlines of figures—before giggling and flitting off.\nSyl watched them with fondness. He wanted to ask her what she was\nthinking, but didn’t dare speak, lest someone inside hear voices coming in\nthrough a window. He took care to press his handholds into place quietly.\nKaladin hit a snag as he reached the fourth floor. Syl noticed first,\nbecoming a ribbon and making the glyph for “stop” in the air beside him.\nHe froze, then heard it. Voices.\nHe nodded to Syl, who went to investigate. He felt her concern through\nthe bond; when Syl was a Blade, they had a direct mental connection—but\nwhen she was not in that shape, the connection was softer. They’d been\npracticing on sending words to one another, but they tended to be vague\nimpressions.\nThis time, he got a sense of some distinct words.… singers … with\nspyglasses … third-floor balcony … looking up …\nKaladin hung in place, silent as he could be. He could hear them below\nand to the left, on a balcony. They had spyglasses? Why?\nTo watch the sky, he thought, trying to project the idea to Syl. For\nWindrunner scouts. They won’t want to use the Oathgate until they’re\ncertain nobody is watching.\nSyl returned, and Kaladin started to feel his muscles burning again. He\nwiped his sweaty brow on his sleeve, then carefully—his teeth gritted—\ndrew in Stormlight to release one of his brush handholds. His skin started to\nrelease luminescent smoke, but before the light became too obvious, he re-\nLashed the brush and stretched out, attaching it to the rock as far to his right\nas he could reach.\nHe moved to the side, away from the occupied balcony. He could climb\nacross the next balcony over. As he moved, he heard the singers chatting in\nAlethi—femalen voices he thought, though some singer forms made gender\ndifficult to distinguish from the voice. Judging by the conversation, they\nwere indeed watching for Windrunners. They did Oathgate transfers at night"

They did Oathgate transfers at night\ndeliberately—when flying Radiants would be starkly visible, glowing in the\nnight sky.\nKaladin crossed over two balconies to his right, then continued down\nanother open flat corridor of stone. He was on the northern part of the\ntower, and had moved west to get away from the scouts. Syl kept checking\nthe nearby balconies as Kaladin continued his methodical pace.\nUnfortunately, soon after he’d passed the third floor, a dark light flashed\nfrom the Oathgates. It was tinged violet like Voidlight, but was brighter than\na Voidlight sphere.\nKaladin took a moment to rest, hanging on but not moving. “Syl,” he\nwhispered. “Go check on those scouts on the balcony. Tell me if they’re still\nwatching the sky.”\nShe zipped off, then returned a moment later.\n“They’re packing up their things,” she whispered. “Looks like they’re\nleaving.”\nThat was what he’d feared. The enemy would use the Oathgates as\ninfrequently as possible, as moving singer troops in and out of the tower\nwould expose them to spying eyes. If the scouts were packing up, it was a\nfairly solid indication that the Oathgates wouldn’t be used again tonight.\nKaladin had been too slow.\nBut the gate had flashed with Voidlight. So he knew they’d done\nsomething to the fabrial. He’d have to try again tomorrow; he’d moved\nslower than he’d intended today, but he felt good about the process. A little\nmore practice, and he could probably get down fast enough. But would\ngetting close to the Oathgates tell him anything about what had been done\nto them? He didn’t feel he knew enough about fabrials.\nFor now, he started climbing back up to see how much more difficult it\nwas. This was slower, but the footholds with his boots were more helpful.\nAs he ascended, he found a fierce pride in the effort. The changes to the\ntower had tried to keep him confined to the ground, but the sky was his.\nHe’d found a way to scale her again, if in a less impressive way. If he …\nKaladin paused, hanging from his handholds, as something struck him.\nSomething that he felt profoundly stupid for having not seen immediately.\n“The scouts on the balcony,” he whispered to Syl as she darted in to see\nwhy he’d stopped. “What would they have done if they’d spotted\nWindrunners in the sky?”\n“They’d have told the others to stop the transfer,” Syl said, “so the fact\nthat the Oathgate glowed the wrong color wouldn’t give away the truth.”\n“How?” Kaladin asked. “How did they contact the Oathgate operators?\nDid you see flags or anything?”\n“No,” Syl said. “They were just sitting there writing in the dark. They\nmust have been using … a spanreed.”\nOne that worked in the tower. Navani was trying to figure out how the\nenemy was operating fabrials. What if he could hand her one? Surely that\nwould lead to more valuable information than he would get by observing\nthe Oathgates.\nSyl zipped over to the balcony the scouts had been using. “I can see"

He might have missed the night’s transfer, but there was still\na way he could help.\nAnd it involved stealing that spanreed.\nBut how can we not, in searching, wish for a specific result? What\nscientist goes into a project without a hope for what they will find?\n—From Rhythm of War, page 6 undertext\nVenli inspected the large model of the tower. Such an intricate construction,\na masterwork of sculpting, bathed in violet moonlight through the window.\nWhat had it been used for by the Radiants of old, all those years ago? Was\nthis a forgotten art piece, or something more? She’d heard several\nVoidspren saying that perhaps it was a scale model for the spren to live in,\nbut—for all its intricacy—it didn’t have things like furniture or doors.\nShe walked around it, passing through the middle, where it was split to\nshow a cross section. For some reason, seeing it in miniature highlighted\nhow impossibly vast the tower was. Even reconstructed like this, it was\ntwice Venli’s height.\nShe shook her head and left the model behind, moving among the fallen\nRadiants, each of whom lay silent on the floor of this large chamber.\nAccording to Raboniel’s request, Venli had found a place to keep them all\ntogether. She’d wanted them on the ground floor, close enough to the\nbasement rooms to be sent for, but that region of the tower was quite well\noccupied. So rather than go to the trouble of kicking people out of a\nchamber to use, Venli had appropriated this newly discovered—and empty\n—one. It had only one entrance, so it was easy to guard, and the window\nprovided natural light.\nThere were around fifty of them in total. Perhaps with such low numbers,\nRaboniel’s forces could have taken this place even if the Radiants had\nfought. Perhaps not. There was something about these modern Radiants.\nThe Fused seemed to be constantly surprised by them. Everyone had\nexpected impotence, inexperience. Roshar had gone centuries without the\nRadiant bond. These had no masters to train them; they had to discover\neverything on their own. How did they do so well?\nTimbre pulsed her thoughts on the matter. Sometimes ignorance was an\nadvantage, as you weren’t limited by the expectations of the past. Perhaps\nthat was it. Or perhaps it was something else. New, younger spren,\nenthusiastic—pitted against weary old Fused souls.\nVenli lingered near the body of a young woman. The Radiants were each\nlying on a blanket and draped with a sheet, corpselike, leaving only their\nfaces exposed. This Radiant, however, was stirring. Her eyes were closed,\nbut her face twitched, as if she were in the grip of a terrible nightmare. She\nmight be. Odium had invaded Venli’s mind in the past; who knew how far\nhis corrupting touch could reach?"

Odium had invaded Venli’s mind in the past; who knew how far\nhis corrupting touch could reach?\nWindrunner, Venli thought, reading the markings on the floor next to the\nwoman. They listed whatever Venli’s team had been able to learn about the\nindividual Radiants from interrogating the tower’s humans. She glanced\ndown the row toward another Radiant whose face was making similar\nexpressions. Also a Windrunner.\nShe finished her inspection and met up with Dul. It had turned out to be\nsimple for Venli to put her most trusted people in charge of the fallen\nRadiants, as Raboniel thought it a good use for them.\n“The other Windrunners,” Venli said softly. “Do they all seem…”\n“Closer to waking?” Dul asked to Awe. “Yeah. They do. Any time one of\nthe Radiants stirs, it’s always a Windrunner. We’ve caught some of them\nmuttering in their sleep.”\n“Raboniel asked me specifically to check on this,” Venli said to Anxiety.\n“She seemed to have anticipated it.”\n“Not hard to guess,” Dul said. “The Radiant who is awake—supposedly\nroaming the tower—is a Windrunner, right?”\nVenli nodded, looking along the rows of bodies. Venli’s loyalists moved\namong them, administering broth and changing soiled blankets.\n“This was a good maneuver, putting us here,” Dul whispered. “Caring\nfor the humans gives us an excuse to collect blankets and clothing for when\nwe leave. I’ve begun putting away broth paste that should keep.”\n“Good,” Venli said to Anxiety. “When only our people are around, test\nthose Windrunners and see if you can wake one up.”\n“And if we succeed?” Dul asked to Skepticism. “I think that’s a terrible\nidea.”\nVenli’s first instinct—even still—was to slap him. How dare he question\nher? She pushed away that instinct, though it warned her that she was the\nsame selfish person, despite it all. A few Words didn’t suddenly make her\nsomething better.\n“Their powers would be suppressed,” Venli explained to him. “So they\nshouldn’t be a danger to you. And if they are violent, get away and let it be\nassumed they woke up spontaneously. That will keep us from being\nimplicated.”\n“Fine, but why risk it?”\n“Escaping and hiding will be far easier with the help of one like these,”\nVenli said. “At the very least, we’ll need a distraction to get out. The\nWindrunners waking and suddenly fighting would provide that.”\nShe glanced at Dul, who still hummed to Skepticism.\n“Look,” Venli said as they completed a walk around the room, “I don’t\nlike humans any more than you do. But if we truly want to escape, we’ll\nneed to make use of every advantage we can find.” She swept her hand\nacross the room of unconscious Radiants. “This could be a very large one.”\nFinally, Dul hummed to Reconciliation. “I suppose you’re right. It’s\nworth trying, though I’m not sure how to wake these up. What we need is a\nsurgeon. Could probably use one anyway; some of these seem to be getting"

Others won’t take any broth, though they have\nhungerspren buzzing around them.”\nVenli attuned Peace as an idea occurred to her. “I’m sure I could get you\nsurgeons. In fact, I know of one who might be willing to help our cause. A\nhuman. He’s in hiding, because of certain matters we shouldn’t spread. But\nI think we could place him here, to help.”\nDul nodded, humming to Appreciation. Venli left, stepping out onto the\nfloor of the atrium—with the long vertical shaft running up toward the top\nof the tower. She passed several Regals standing guard at the door to the\nroom with the model. Leshwi had told her to put the surgeon and his family\nsomeplace safe; well, this made sense.\nCurfew was nearing, so here on the floor of the atrium, people were\nhurrying about their last-minute activities. The humans—no longer confined\nto quarters—had crept from their shells like vines after a storm. Many of\nthem lived around the atrium, and they had pulled out carts, making\ntemporary shops here near the large window. Like spren to the Passions, the\nhumans sought out the sunlight.\nTonight, they walked timidly and kept their distance from Venli, as if\nthey couldn’t believe that they were supposed to continue on as if nothing\nhad happened. Venli found a stairwell and hurried up, causing a few human\nwomen to pull to one side and gasp softly, drawing wormlike fearspren.\nSometimes Venli forgot how fearsome her Regal form looked. She’d grown\ncomfortable with it, and more and more it felt like her natural state—even if\nthere was a Voidspren trapped in her gemheart.\nOn the second floor, Venli made her way toward a meeting point near the\natrium balcony. She was supposed to give service to a team of Fused\ntonight, in case they needed an interpreter. Many Fused had trouble\nspeaking to modern singers. That made sense, considering how short a time\nthey’d been back. Venli found it odder that some—like Raboniel—had\nalready learned to speak modern Alethi.\nVenli arrived at the meeting place, surprised to find several Deepest\nOnes: the strange Fused with limber bodies and milky-white eyes glowing\nred from behind. They enjoyed spending their time sunken in rock as much\nas the Heavenly Ones liked to soar. She had occasionally walked into a\nroom to find one or two of them lingering there, sunken into the floor,\nrevealing only their faces, eyes closed.\nTonight four stood in a clump, attended by a few ordinary singers\ncarrying equipment. The Fused were arguing among themselves in their\nlanguage.\n“I did not think the sand would work,” one of the Deepest Ones said to\nSpite. Their rhythms sounded off. Muted. “I was right in this. You should\nacknowledge it.”\n“There are too many different fabrials in the tower,” said another. “And\ntoo many spren. The device we hunt doesn’t leave a strong enough\nimpression to be noticeable, hidden as it is.”"

The device we hunt doesn’t leave a strong enough\nimpression to be noticeable, hidden as it is.”\n“You’re searching for the fabrial that is creating the shield around the\ncrystal pillar,” Venli guessed. Raboniel had mentioned the field was created\nby a fabrial—which she theorized would have several gemstones, called\nnodes, maintaining it, hidden somewhere in the tower.\nThe Deepest Ones did not directly reprimand her for speaking without\nfirst being addressed. As Raboniel’s Voice, Venli had a certain amount of\nauthority, even with these. Not to command, but certainly to speak.\n“Why not use secretspren?” she asked. “They can find fabrials as easily\nas they find Radiants, can’t they?”\n“The entire tower is a fabrial,” one of the Deepest Ones said. “The\nsecretspren are useless here; they spin in circles, confused. Asking them to\nfind a specific use of Light in here is like asking them to find a specific\npatch of water in an ocean.”\n“Useless spren,” another said. “Have you seen the chaosspren?”\nVenli had. Those types of Voidspren—normally invisible to anyone but\nthe ones they appeared to—left sparks in the air now, as if somehow\nresponding to the dampening field. In this place, even someone who\ncouldn’t look into Shadesmar could know whether they were being watched\nor not.\nAs Venli thought on that, she attuned Excitement. No invisible spren …\nand the secretspren were useless. That meant a Radiant in the tower would\nbe free to use their powers without being noticed.\nShe could use her powers without being noticed.\nThe implications of it made Timbre begin to thrum to Excitement as\nwell, in time with Venli’s attunement. Finally. They could practice.\nDared she, though?\n“Voice,” one of the Deepest Ones said, waving her over. It was a femalen\nwith pale white skin, swirled with the faintest lines of red. “We need to find\nthese nodes. But without secretspren, we might have to search the entire\ntower. You will begin interrogating humans, asking if they’ve seen a large\ngemstone that seems unattached from any visible fabrial.”\n“As you wish, Ancient One,” Venli said to Abashment. “But if I may say,\nthis seems an inelegant solution. Are the nodes not likely to be hidden?”\n“Yes,” another said, “but they will also need to be accessible. Their\npurpose is to let Radiants charge the shield with Stormlight.”\n“Be that as it may, Ancient One, I am skeptical,” Venli said. “Assuming\nhumans answered me truthfully, I suspect they would not know anything.\nThey have not finished mapping all the floors of the tower, let alone its\nsecret places. Do you truly wish us to spend months talking to each human,\nasking them if they’ve seen something as vague as a random gemstone?”\nThe Deepest Ones hummed to Destruction, but otherwise did not\ncontradict her. As with many of the Fused, they did not object out of hand to\nbeing challenged, not if the argument was a good one. Venli could learn\nfrom them in that regard."

Venli could learn\nfrom them in that regard.\n“This is as I said,” one said to the others. “We could search this place for\nyears and discover nothing.”\n“Won’t the nodes be connected to the crystal pillar?” Venli asked.\n“Yes,” said one of the Deepest Ones. “By veins of crystal, for\ntransporting Stormlight.”\n“Then we could follow those,” Venli said. “You could sink into the rock\nand find them, then trace them outward.”\n“No,” said another to Derision. “We cannot see while embedded. We can\nhear, and we can sing, and the tones of Roshar guide us. But this fabrial is\nmade to be silent to us. To trace the lines, we would need to break apart the\nstone—and sever all the connections to the pillar. That might destroy the\ntower’s protections entirely, letting the Radiants awaken and defeating our\npurpose.”\n“So if you did find a gemstone in the tower,” Venli said, “you couldn’t\nknow whether it was tied to the protective field. You might break the\ngemstone and find it was tied to something else entirely.”\nThe Fused hummed at her in Derision. Venli was pushing the boundaries\nof the interference they would accept. “No, foolish one,” the femalen said.\n“This fabrial of protection is new. Added to the tower after its creation.\nThere will be few other gemstones like it. The rest of the tower works as a\nsingle entity, which is why Raboniel was able to engage its protections by\ninfusing it with Voidlight.”\nThat … didn’t really explain as much as they seemed to think, but Venli\nhummed to Subservience to indicate she appreciated the information and\nthe correction. Her mind, however, was still daunted by the implications of\nwhat she’d learned earlier. She’d spent all these months being timid about\nher powers, telling herself she didn’t dare use them. Why was she so\nworried now, though?\nTimbre pulsed. Indicating it was all right to be afraid of trying something\nnew. It was natural.\nBut that wasn’t it, not entirely. It seemed that most of Venli’s life, she’d\nbeen afraid of the wrong things. Her curiosity had led to her people’s\ndownfall. And now she played with powers she didn’t understand, gathering\nan entire group of hopefuls who depended on her.\nIf she made a wrong move, Dul and the others were doomed.\nThe Deepest Ones conferred. The femalen continued to watch Venli,\nhowever. The other three seemed to regard her as their foremost, for they\nquieted when she spoke.\n“You are mortal,” she said to Venli. “You are the Last Listener. Few\nRegals earn a true title, and I find it odd to see the child of traitors\ndeveloping one. Tell me, where would you place these nodes, if you were to\ndo so?”\n“I…” Venli attuned Agony. “I have no knowledge of the tower. I\ncouldn’t say.”\n“Guess,” the Fused prompted. “Try.”\n“I suppose,” Venli said, “I would put it someplace easy to give it"

I am foolish, Ancient One, and ignorant.”\n“Perhaps, but you are also mortal—and think like one,” the Fused\nconsidered. “Mortals are busy. They live short lives, always stuffed with so\nmany things to do. Yet they are also lazy. They want to do none of what\nthey should. Would you not say this is true?”\n“I … Yes, of course,” Venli said. This was not a Fused wanting someone\nto object.\n“Yes,” said another Deepest One. “Would they not put the gemstone\nnodes, at least one of them, where Stormlight could renew it naturally?”\n“Storms reach this high only occasionally,” another said, “but they do\ncome up here. So it would make sense to put one in reach of the occasional\nfree infusion of power.”\nTimbre pulsed to Sorrow inside Venli. This was exactly the idea she’d\nchosen not to share. Where was the best place for a node? Outside\nsomewhere—but not on the balconies, where it could be spotted. She\nlooked across the atrium toward the large window. The Deepest Ones had\ncome to the same conclusion apparently, for they flowed away toward the\nfar wall, to look for signs of a gemstone embedded outside.\nTimbre pulsed to Disappointment.\n“I didn’t try to help,” Venli whispered. “Besides, they mostly figured it\nout on their own.”\nTimbre pulsed again. Hopefully it would turn out to be nothing. It was\njust a guess, after all.\nThe Fused had left her with no instructions, so she remained with the\nservants—until she spotted a familiar figure hurrying through the corridor.\nMazish, Dul’s wife, one of Venli’s inner circle.\nShe stepped forward quickly, intercepting the squat workform—who was\nhumming to Anxiety.\n“What?” Venli asked.\n“Venli,” she said. “Venli, they … they’ve found another.”\n“Another Radiant?” Venli asked to Confusion.\n“No. No, not that. I mean.” She seized Venli by the arm. “Another one of\nyou. Another listener.”\nEIGHT AND A HALF YEARS AGO\nEshonai found the humans endlessly fascinating.\nBetween their first and second visits, Eshonai had organized several trips\nto try to find their homeland. Suddenly, everyone had wanted to join her,\nand she’d led large expeditions. Those had been all song, and no crescendo,\nunfortunately—the only thing she’d been able to locate was a solitary\nhuman outpost to the west.\nThey’d told her to expect a second visit soon, but now that visit seemed\nto be drawing to a close. So Eshonai took every remaining opportunity to\nwatch the humans. She loved the way they walked, the way they talked,\neven the way they looked at her. Or sometimes didn’t.\nLike today, as she strolled through Gavilar Kholin’s camp. His servants"

She stepped up beside one worker,\nwho was unstringing a large metal bow. The man must have seen her\nstanding there—but when he stood up a few minutes later, he jumped to\nfind her beside him.\nSuch strange behavior. Sometimes she thought she could read the\nrhythms in the human motions—like that man with the bow would be\nattuned to Anxiety. Yet they still didn’t seem to grasp that listeners could\nhear something they could not. What would it be like to go about all the\ntime without a rhythm in your head? It must be painful. Or lonely. So\nempty.\nThe various humans continued their packing, storing everything in\nwagons for the day’s storm. The humans were good at judging the arrival of\nthose—though they were often wrong on the hour, they were usually right\non the day. This, however, was no routine pre-storm packing job. They\nwould soon leave; she could read this in the way they talked to each other,\nthe way they double-checked bindings and folded tents with more precision\nthan usual. They weren’t planning to unpack any of it for a while.\nShe wished they would stay longer—their first interaction had been so\nshort, and now this second visit was over almost before it began. Perhaps\nshe could go with them, as she’d told Venli. She’d asked how far beyond\nthe hills their home was, but they didn’t answer, and refused to share their\nmaps.\nEshonai moved to slip out of camp, but stopped as she noticed one man\nstanding off from the rest. Dalinar Kholin looked out, eastward, toward the\nOrigin of Storms.\nCurious, Eshonai walked up to him, noting that he had his Shardblade\nout. He held it lightly before him, the tip sunken into the stone. He seemed\nto be searching for something, but before him stretched only the Plains—an\nempty expanse.\nUnlike the others, he noticed her approach immediately, turning as she\nmade the slightest scrape on the stones while walking. She froze beneath his\ngaze, which always seemed to be the stare of a greatshell.\n“You’re one of the interpreters,” he said.\n“Yes.”\n“What was your name?”\n“Eshonai,” she said, though she had little doubt he’d forget again. The\nhumans didn’t seem to be able to distinguish very well between different\nlisteners.\n“Have you been out there?” he asked, nodding toward the Plains. “To the\ncenter?”\n“No,” she said. “I’d like to go, but the old bridges … they do not stand.\nIt would take work, much work, to put them back. Most of my people don’t\nlike … what is the word? Going where it is difficult to go?”\n“Exploring, perhaps,” he said.\n“Yes. Exploring. We once exploring. But now, very little exploring.”\nUntil recently.\nHe grunted. “You’re good with our language.”\n“I like it,” she said. “Speaking new ways. Thinking new ways.

Toward his homeland. “Perhaps your people are afraid to return to\nwhere they once lived.”\n“Why fear that?” Eshonai asked, attuning Confusion.\n“Places have power over us, parshwoman,” he said. “Places have\nmemories. Sometimes when you go to a place you’ve never been, it can be\nwonderful … because it lets you be someone else. No expectations. No\nstorming memories.”\n“I like new places,” she said. “Because … they are new.” She attuned\nIrritation. That hadn’t come out as she’d wanted it to; she felt stupid,\nspeaking their language. It was difficult to express anything deep while\nspeaking it, because the rhythms didn’t match the sounds.\n“Wise words,” Dalinar said.\nWise words? Was he being patronizing? Humans seemed to not expect\nmuch from her people, and were surprised whenever a complex\nconversation happened. As if they were amused that the listeners were not\nas dull-minded as parshmen.\n“I would like to go to see places where you live,” Eshonai said. “I would\nvisit you, and have you visit us, more.”\nDalinar dismissed his Blade, sending it away with a puff of white fog.\nShe attuned Confusion.\n“My brother has taken an interest in you,” Dalinar said softly. “This …\nWell, be more cautious with your invitations, parshwoman. Our attention\ncan be dangerous.”\n“I do not understand,” she said. It sounded as if he were warning her\nagainst his own.\n“I have grown tired of pushing people around,” Dalinar said. “In my\nwake, I’ve left too many smoldering holes where cities used to be. You are\nsomething special, something we’ve never seen before. And I know my\nbrother—I know that look in his eyes, that excitement.\n“His interest could benefit you, but it could have an equal cost. Do not be\nso quick to share your stormshelter with men you just barely met. Don’t\noffend, but also don’t be too quick to bend. Any new recruit needs to learn\nboth lessons. In this case, I’d suggest politeness—but care. Do not let him\nback you into a corner. He will respect you if you stand up for yourselves.\nAnd whatever you do, don’t give him any reason to decide he wants what\nyou have.”\nBe forceful, stand up for themselves, but don’t offend their king? How\ndid that make any sense? Yet looking at him—listening to his calm but firm\nvoice—she thought she did understand. His intent, as if given to her by a\nrhythm.\nBe careful with us was what he was saying. We are far more dangerous\nthan you think.\nHe had mentioned … burning cities.\n“How many cities do your people live in?” she asked.\n“Hundreds,” he said. “The number of humans in our realm would\nstagger you. It is many times the number of parshmen I’ve seen here living\nwith you.”\nImpossible. That … was impossible, wasn’t it?\nWe know so little.\n“Thank you,” she said to Appreciation.

She got it to click, the way of\nspeaking his language but putting a rhythm to it. It could work.\nHe nodded to her. “We are leaving. I realize this visit was short, but my\nbrother needs to return to his lands. You will … certainly meet us again. We\nwill send a more permanent envoy. I promise you this.”\nHe turned, moving with the momentum of a shifting boulder, and walked\ntoward his stormwagon.\n* * *\nVenli felt as if the bright red gemstone would burn its way through her\nclothing. She huddled in one of the stormshelters: a group of wide slits in\nthe ground near the city, which they’d covered over with animal carapace\nand crem. Each was in the top of a hill, so the sides could drain.\nVenli’s immediate family gathered together in this one to chat and feast,\nas was their habit during storm days. The others seemed so cheerful,\nspeaking to Joy or Appreciation while they ate beside the fire, listening as\nVenli’s mother sang songs by the light of uncut gemhearts.\nThose could be organic, lumpish things. While they took in Stormlight,\nnone were nearly as bright as the strange gemstone in her pocket. The one\nthe human had given her. Venli felt as if it should be on fire, though it was\nas cold as a normal gemstone. She attuned Anxiety and glanced at the\nothers, worrying they’d see that too-red glow.\nI’m supposed to go out into the storm, she thought, listening to the rain\npound distant stone. Does this count? I can see the storm out there, flashing\nand making its own rhythm, too frantic. Too wild.\nNo, she wasn’t close enough. Hiding in one of these shelters wouldn’t\nallow her to adopt mateform, which was the sole transformation they did\nregularly. No one wanted to go back to dullform, after all.\nThere were other forms to be found. She’d been close to warform. And\nnow … this gemstone …\nShe’d carried it for weeks, terrified of what might happen. She glanced at\nher mother, and the close family members who sat and listened. Enraptured\nby the beautiful songs. Even Venli, who had heard them hundreds of times,\nfound herself wanting to drift back and sit at her mother’s feet.\nNone of them knew what was happening. To Jaxlim. Mother hid it well.\nWas it true, that other forms could help her? The humans were leaving now,\nso this was the last chance Venli would have to try the gemstone, then—if it\ndidn’t work—get answers from the human who had given it to her.\nVenli attuned Determination and rose from her place, walking toward the\nend of the shelter, where they’d tied their gemstones to be renewed—close\nenough to the storm to be given light by the Rider’s touch. Several of the\nothers whispered behind her, their voices attuned to Amusement. They\nthought she had decided to adopt mateform, which she’d always been\nadamant she would never do.\nHer mother had smiled when she’d asked, explaining that few ever\nintended to adopt mateform.

She acted as if it was simply something that\nhappened, that an urge overtook you, or you sat too close to the exit during\na storm—then poof, the next thing you knew, you’d become a silly idiot\nlooking to breed. It was embarrassing to think others assumed Venli was\ndoing that now.\nShe reached the wet stone at the edge of the shelter, where rainspren\nclustered with eyes pointed upward and grasping claws below. The wind\nand thunder were louder here, like the war calls of a rival family, trying to\nfrighten her away.\nPerhaps it would be best just to give the gemstone to her mother, and let\nher go try to find the new form. Wasn’t that what this was about?\nNo, Venli thought, trembling. No. It’s not.\nMonths spent trying to find new forms had gotten her nowhere—while\nEshonai gained more and more acclaim. Even their mother, who had called\nher explorations foolish, now spoke of Eshonai with respect. The person\nwho had found the humans. The person who had changed the world.\nVenli had done what she was supposed to. She’d remained with her\nmother, she’d spent endless days memorizing songs, dutiful. But Eshonai\ngot the praise.\nBefore her nerves betrayed her, Venli stepped out onto the hillside,\nentering the storm. The force of the wind made her stumble and slide down\nthe slick rock. In an eyeblink she went from sheltered, song-filled warmth\nto icy chaos. A tempest with sounds like instruments breaking and songs\nfailing. She tried to hold to the Rhythm of Resolve, but it was the Rhythm\nof Winds by the time she scrambled behind a large boulder and pressed her\nback against the stone.\nFrom there, her mind devolved to the Rhythm of Pleading, bordering on\npanic. What was she doing? This was insanity. She’d often mocked those\nwho went out in the storms without shields or other protections.\nShe wanted to return to the shelter, but she was too frightened to move.\nSomething large crushed the ground nearby, causing her to jump, but a\nmoment of darkness in the howling tempest prevented her from seeing how\nclose the impact had been. As if the lightning, the wind, and the rain all\nconspired against her.\nShe reached into her pocket and took out the gemstone. What had\nseemed so bright before now seemed frail. The red light barely illuminated\nher hand.\nBreak it. She was supposed to break it. With fingers already numb from\nthe cold, she searched around, eventually finding a large stone. The ground\nwas shattered here in a circle the size of a listener. She retreated to the\nrelative shelter of the boulder, shivering as she held the gemstone in one\nhand, the rock in the other.\nThen silence.\nIt was so sudden, so unexpected, that she gasped. The rhythms in her\nmind became as one, a single steady beat. She looked upward into pure\nblackness. The ground around her seemed dry all of a sudden. She slowly\nturned around, then huddled down again. There was something in the sky,\nsomething like a face made from clouds and natural light. The impression\nof something vast and unknowable."

The\nsongs called him a traitor.\nYOU HAVE SPENT SO LONG AS CHILDREN OF NO GOD, the rhythm said to her.\nYOU WOULD MAKE THIS CHOICE FOR ALL OF YOUR PEOPLE?\nVenli felt both a thrill and a terror at those words. So there was\nsomething in the gemstone?\n“My … my people need forms!” she shouted up toward the vast entity.\nTHIS IS MORE THAN FORMS. THIS POWER CHANGES MORTALS.\nPower?\n“You served our enemies!” she called to the sky. “How can I trust what\nyou say?”\nYET YOU TRUST THE GIFT OF ONE OF THOSE ENEMIES? REGARDLESS, I SERVE\nNO ONE. NOT MAN OR SINGER. I SIMPLY AM. FAREWELL, CHILD OF THE PLAINS.\nCHILD OF ODIUM.\nThe vision ended as abruptly as it had begun, and Venli was again in the\nstorm. She nearly dropped her burdens in shock, but then—huddling against\nthe gleeful wind—she set the glowing gemstone on the ground. She gripped\nthe rock in her hand, slick with rain. She wavered.\nShould she take more care?\nWhat greatness was achieved by being careful, though?\nEshonai hadn’t been careful, and she’d discovered a new world. Venli\nslammed the stone downward and crushed the gem. Light escaped in a puff,\nand she winced in the pelting rain, bracing herself for a wondrous\ntransformation.\n“Finally!” a voice said to the Rhythm of Irritation. “That was\nunpleasant.” The red light turned into a tiny human male, standing with\nhands on hips, glowing faintly in the storm.\nVenli pulled her arms in tight, shivering, blinking rainwater out of her\neyes. “Spren,” she hissed. “I have summoned you to grant me one of the\nancient forms.”\n“You?” he asked. “How old are you? Are there any others I could talk\nto?”\n“Show me this secret first,” she said. “Then we will give your form to\nothers. It can heal them, right? That is what I was told.”\nHe didn’t reply.\n“You will not deny me this!” Venli said, though her words were lost in a\nsudden peal of thunder. “I’ve suffered long to accomplish this goal.”\n“Well, you’re certainly dramatic,” the little spren said, tapping his foot.\n“Guess we use the tools we find in the shed, even if they’ve got a little rust\non them. Here’s the deal. I’m going to take up residence inside of you, and\ntogether we’re going to do some incredible things.”\n“We will bring useful forms to my people?” Venli asked, her teeth\nchattering.\n“Well, yes.

The flashes of\nlightning, though brilliant, were too brief to give her a real picture of the\nlandscape.\n“She really did it, did she?” Thude asked to Amusement as he stepped up\nbeside her, chewing on some fruit. “After all that complaining, she\nsauntered out to become a mate.”\n“I doubt it,” Eshonai said. “She’s been trying to find warform for months\nnow. She’s not looking to become a mate. She’s too young, anyway.” The\nhumans had been surprised at how young Eshonai and Venli were—\napparently, humans aged more slowly? But Venli was still months away\nfrom official adulthood.\n“Younger ones have made the decision,” Thude said, rubbing at his\nbeard. “I’ve thought about it, you know? There’s a certain bond to once-\nmates.”\n“You just think it sounds fun,” Eshonai said to Reprimand.\nHe laughed. “I do at that.” Thunder shook the enclosure, silencing both\nof them for a time as they listened to it, both attuning the Rhythm of Winds\nout of deference. There was something wondrous—if dangerous—about\nfeeling the very vibrations of the storm.\n“This isn’t the time to be distracted by something silly like mateform,”\nEshonai said. “The humans are leaving again once this storm ends. We\nshould be talking about sending someone with them.”\n“You’re too responsible for your own good sometimes, Eshonai,” Thude\nreplied, his arm up against the top of the enclosure as he leaned forward,\nletting the rain hit his face.\n“Me? Responsible?” she said. “Mother might have words for you on that\ntopic.”\n“And each one would remind me how alike the two of you are,” Thude\nsaid, attuned to Joy and grinning at the storm like a fool. “I’m going to do it\none of these days, Eshonai. I’m going to see if Bila will go with me. Life is\nmeant to be more than working the fields or chopping wood.”\nWith that, Eshonai could agree. And she supposed she could understand\nsomeone wanting to do something different with their life. None of them\nwould exist if their parents hadn’t decided to become mates.\nThe idea still made her want to attune Anxiety. She disliked how much\nthat form changed the way people thought.

He had failed to spy on the Oathgates, but if he could somehow\nsteal one of those Voidlight spanreeds, he could still help Navani.\nHe crept as quickly as he dared in the darkness, one hand on the wall. He\nsoon neared a hallway with lanterns along the wall; as this was the third\nfloor of the tower, much of it was occupied and lit. The lanterns revealed\ntwo femalen singers ahead, wearing havahs and chatting quietly. Syl\ncarefully darted into side tunnels and nooks behind them.\nKaladin trailed far behind, relying on Syl to point out turns, as the two\nsingers were often out of his direct line of sight. This section of the tower\nwas a large laundry facility, where darkeyes could come to use public water\nand soap. He passed several large rooms without doors where the floor was\nshaped into a sequence of basins.\nIt was nearly empty now. The tower’s pumps hadn’t been changed to\nwork on Voidlight, it seemed. He did have to avoid several water-carrying\nteams—humans pulling carts, with singer guards—moving through the\ntunnels. Syl soon came zipping back, so he ducked into a darkened alcove\nnear an empty room full of baskets for laundry. The place smelled of soap.\n“Guard post ahead,” she whispered. “They went through it. What do you\nwant to do?”\n“Any Fused nearby?” Kaladin asked.\n“Not that I saw. Only ordinary singers.”\n“Theoretically, regular guards shouldn’t be able to see you unless you let\nthem. Follow those singers with the spanreeds. Hopefully their rooms are\nnearby. If they split up, pick the one with the blue havah—the embroidery\nindicates she’s the more important. Once you know where her room is,\ncome back, then we can sneak in another way and steal the spanreed.”\n“Right. If they get too far away from you though, I’ll lose myself.…”\n“Return if you start to feel that,” he said. “We can try another night.”\nSyl soared off without another word, leaving Kaladin hiding inside the\nroom with the baskets. Unfortunately, he soon heard voices—and peeked to\nsee a pair of singers with baskets walking down the hallway. Even an\noccupying force of ancient evil soldiers needed to do laundry, it seemed.\nKaladin closed the door, shutting himself in darkness, then—realizing there\nwas a chance they were coming to dump their baskets in this very room—\nhe grabbed a broom and lashed it across the door.\nSince he’d infused the broom on either end, no Stormlight should show\nthrough the door. A moment later it rattled as they tried to push it inward.\nAnnoyed voices outside complained in Azish as they tried the door again.\nHe gripped his knife, darkness weighing upon him. The horror of the\nnightmares, and a fatigue that went far deeper than the earlier strain to his\nmuscles.

He heard the sounds of bowstrings, and of Gaz yelling for the\nbridgemen to run. Screams of men dying, and … And …\nHe blinked. The door had fallen still. When … when had that happened?\nHe gave it a few minutes, wiping the sweat from his forehead, then un-\nLashed the broom and cracked the door. Two abandoned baskets sat nearby,\nno singers in sight. He let out a long breath, then pried his fingers off his\nscalpel and tucked it away.\nEventually Syl returned. “They weren’t going to their rooms,” she said,\nanimatedly dancing around in patterns as a ribbon of light. “They dropped\noff their spanreed in a room ahead where there are dozens of spanreeds,\nwatched over by a couple of senior femalens.”\nKaladin nodded, breathing deeply, fighting back the tiredness.\n“You … all right?” Syl asked.\n“I’m fine,” Kaladin said. “That’s a spanreed hub you found. Makes sense\nthey’d set one up in the tower.” Maintaining hundreds of spanreeds could\ngrow unwieldy, so many highlords and highladies would set up hubs.\nDisparate locations—like guard posts around the tower—could send reports\nto a central room, where the hub attendants sifted for important information\nand sent it to those in power.\nThe singers were keeping their reeds in central locations to be checked\nout, used, and returned. The reeds wouldn’t go home with individual\nscribes. This wasn’t going to be as easy as sneaking into a bedroom to grab\none, but the hub might offer other opportunities.\n“We need to get past that guard post,” Kaladin whispered, burying his\nfatigue.\n“There’s something else, Kaladin,” Syl said. “Look out the door, down\nthe tunnel.”\nFrowning, he did as she requested, peeking out and watching down the\ntunnel. He was confused, until he saw something pass in the air—like\nrippling red lightning.\n“That’s a new kind of Voidspren,” he said. The ones he’d seen in the past\nthat looked like lightning moved along the ground.\n“It’s not, though,” Syl said. “That spren should be invisible to people,\nbut something is off about its aura. It is leaving a trail that I noted the\nguards watching.”\nCurious. So the tower was interfering with spren invisibility? “Did the\nguards look at you when you passed?”\n“No, but they might just not have noticed me.”\nKaladin nodded, watching a little longer. That spren in the distance\ndidn’t pass again. “It’s worth the risk,” he decided, “in proceeding. At least\nwe’ll know if we’re being spied upon.”\n“But what about that guard post?” she asked.\n“I doubt we’ll be able to sneak around it,” he said. “They’ll have all\ndirections guarded for something valuable like a spanreed hub. But a lot of\nthese rooms have small tunnels at the tops for ventilation. Perhaps we can\nsneak through one of those?”\nSyl led him carefully to an intersection. He peered right, to where four"

        "text": "these rooms have small tunnels at the tops for ventilation. Perhaps we can\nsneak through one of those?”\nSyl led him carefully to an intersection. He peered right, to where four\nguards blocked the way, two at either side of the hallway. Spears at the\ncrooks of their arms, they wore Alethi-style uniforms with knots on the\nshoulders. Kaladin was able to spot one of the ventilation holes nearby, but\nthis one was far too small for him to squeeze into.\nHe’d stood on guard duty himself like that on a number of occasions. If\nthese four were well trained, there would be no luring them away with\nsimple distractions. If you wanted a path well protected, you often posted\nfour. Two to investigate any disturbances, two to remain vigilant.\nWith the hallway this narrow, and with those guards looking as alert as\nthey were … Well, he’d been there. The only times when he’d been drawn\naway, it had involved someone with proper authority commandeering him\nfor another task.\n“Syl,” he whispered, “you’re getting better at changing colors. Do you\nthink you could change your coloring to appear like a Voidspren?”\nShe cocked her head, standing beside him in the air, then scrunched up\nher face in a look of concentration. Her dress changed to red, but not her\n“skin,” even though it was simply another part of her. Strange.\n“I think this is all I can manage,” she said.\n“Then make the dress cover your hands with gloves and put on a mask.”\nShe cocked her head, then changed her clothing so she was wrapped in\nphantom cloth. That bled to a deep red, making her entire form glow with\nthat color.\nShe inspected her arms. “Do you think it will fool them?”\n“It might,” Kaladin said. He pulled a length of rope from his sack, then\nLashed it to the wall. “Go order all four of them to come with you, then pull\nthem over here to look at this.”\n“But … doesn’t that rope risk causing a bigger disturbance? Like, what if\nthey go for backup?”\n“We need something reasonable enough to have caused a Voidspren to\nget riled up. I know guard duty though, and those are common warforms.\nRegular soldiers. I’m guessing that so long as there’s no danger, they’ll just\nmake a report on it.”\nHe hid down a side hallway, waiting as Syl flew off toward the guard\npost. She didn’t look exactly like a Voidspren, but it was a reasonable\napproximation.\nShe drew near to the post, then spoke loudly enough that he heard her\neasily. “You there! I am super annoyed! Super, super annoyed! How can\nyou stand there? Didn’t you see?”\n“Brightness?” one of them said, in Alethi. “Er, Ancient One? We are to\n—”\n“Come on, come on! No, all of you. Come see this! Right now. I’m\nreally annoyed! Can’t you tell?”\nKaladin waited, tense. Would it work? Even when acting angry, there\nwas a certain perkiness to Syl’s voice. She sounded too … lively to be a\nVoidspren.\nThe guards followed though—and as he’d hoped, the glowing length of\nrope on the wall caught their attention entirely. Kaladin was able to sneak"

Kaladin was able to sneak\nout behind them, passing the post.\nAt the end of this hallway was the door Syl said led into the spanreed\nroom. Kaladin didn’t dare slip through it; he’d step directly into the middle\nof a hub of activity. Instead he prowled into a smaller hallway to the right—\nand here he finally caught a break. High up on the wall, near the ceiling, a\ndark cleft indicated a large ventilation shaft in the stone. Maybe big enough\nfor him to squeeze through.\nSyl returned—once again white-blue, and likely invisible. “They’re\nsending one of their number to make a report,” she said. “Like you said.”\nShe peeked into the shaft in the rock Kaladin had found. “What is this?”\nVentilation? he thought, trying to send the idea to her so he wouldn’t\nhave to make noise.\nIt worked. “Seems too big for that,” she said. “This place is so strange.”\nWith two of his brushes, Kaladin was able to haul himself up and inspect\nthe cleft in the stone. Syl flew into the darkened shaft toward some light at\nthe other end. He heard the guards talking as they came back, but he was\naround the corner from them now, out of sight.\nThis ventilation shaft looked like it turned toward the spanreed room just\nto the left. It was big enough. Maybe.\nSyl waved, excited. So he squeezed in. It was more than wide enough to\nthe right and left, but it was barely high enough. He had to move using his\nbrush handholds to pull himself along. He worried the scraping sounds he\nmade would give him away—but he was rewarded when the shaft opened\nup to the left, revealing a small, well-lit room. The shaft he’d entered ran\nthrough the middle of the large thick wall between this room and whatever\nwas on the other side.\nThat meant Kaladin was able to peek in—hidden mostly behind the\nstone—at the room from the top of the wall. Spanreeds stood poised on\nmany pieces of paper, waiting for reports. There was no sign of the two\nsinger women from earlier—they’d delivered their spanreed and gone off\nduty. However, two other femalens in rich dresses maintained the reeds,\nchecking for blinking lights and moving reeds between actively writing on\nboards and inactive piles on the tables.\nSyl entered, and none of them glanced at her, so she seemed to actually\nbe invisible. So, she began reading the reports that were coming in. The\ndoor opened and one of the guards entered, requesting a report be sent to his\nsuperior. They’d found what appeared to be the sign of a Radiant—\nsomething the Pursuer had told everyone to watch for.\nKaladin might not have much time before the creature himself arrived.\nBest to move quickly. As the guard left, Kaladin quietly maneuvered in the\ntight quarters, reaching to his waist and pulling out some of his rope.\nDirectly beneath him was a table with a number of spanreeds, including a\nleather case that had a few nibs sticking out of it.\nHe needed to wait for the perfect moment.

Fortunately, several spanreeds\nstarted blinking at once—and they must have been important ones, for the\ntwo femalens quickly turned to these and stopped working on the soldier’s\nreport. Kaladin Lashed his rope to one of his brushes, then infused the flat\nof the brush with a Reverse Lashing—commanding it to attract certain\nobjects only. In this instance, that leather case.\nThe femalens were so preoccupied that Kaladin felt his chance had\ncome. He lowered the brush on the rope toward the table. As the brush drew\nnear, the leather case moved of its own volition, pulled over so it stuck to\nthe brush.\nHeart thumping, certain he was about to be caught, Kaladin drew it up,\nthe case sticking to the end, the spanreeds inside clinking softly. Nobody\nnoticed, and he pulled it into the shaft.\nInside the case, he found an entire group of spanreeds—at least twenty.\nPerhaps they’d just been delivered, as they were still wrapped in pairs, with\ntwine around them. Judging by the way the rubies glowed with Voidlight,\nhe was hopeful that they would work in the tower.\nHe tucked the large pouch away in his sack. He then spared a thought for\nall the important information that was likely being relayed through this\nroom. Could he steal some of it?\nNo. He’d already risked enough today. He sent a quick thought to Syl,\nwho came zipping up to him as he wiggled backward through the\nventilation shaft. She flitted on ahead of him, then called from behind,\n“Hallway is empty.”\nHe eased out of the hole, catching the edge with his fingers and hanging\na moment before quietly dropping the last few feet to the floor of the\ncorridor. He peeked back out toward the guard post.\n“Now what?” Syl said. “Want me to imitate a Voidspren again?”\nHe nodded. Part of him wanted to try another path, as he worried that\nthese soldiers might grow suspicious at the same ruse. But he also knew\nthey’d fallen for it once, and he knew a direct way to the perimeter using\nthis path. Safer this way.\nAs Syl was getting ready, however, Kaladin spotted something farther\ndown this hallway, away from the guards. A flashing light. He held up his\nhand to stop Syl, then pointed.\n“What is that?” she said, zipping off toward the light. He followed more\ncautiously, stepping up to a blinking garnet light. Frowning, Kaladin\npressed his hand against it.\n“Brightness Navani?” he asked.\nNo, a voice said. It had a middling pitch, not necessarily male or female.\nI need you, Radiant. Please. They’ve found me.\n“You?”\nOne of the nodes! That protect me. Please. Please, you have to defend it.\nPlease.\n“How do you know? Have you told Brightness Navani?”\nPlease.\n“Where?” he said.\nSecond level, near the central atrium. I will lead you.

Protect me.\nSyl hovered beside him. “What?” she asked.\nHe lowered his hand. He was so tired.\nBut today, he couldn’t afford to be tired. He had to be Kaladin\nStormblessed. Kaladin Stormblessed fought anyway.\n“We’re going to need to find me a better weapon,” he said. “Quickly.”\nThis point regarding the Rhythm of War’s emotional influence will be\nof particular interest to El.\n—From Rhythm of War, page 10\nKaladin knew there was a chance he was making a huge mistake. He didn’t\nunderstand the nature of the tower or what was going on with it and Navani.\nHe was risking a great deal by revealing himself.\nHowever, that garnet light had rescued him from the Pursuer’s clutches.\nAnd right now, he’d heard something in the spren’s voice. A genuine fright.\nTerror, combined with a plea for protection, was not something Kaladin\ncould ignore.\nHe was fatigued mentally and physically. As he ran, he drew a field of\nexhaustionspren, like jets of dust. Worse, a part of him panicked these days\nevery time he went to pick up a weapon. He’d trained himself these last\nmonths to function despite those things. He leaned on the spike of energy\nthat coursed through him, even before he drew in Stormlight. He let that\ncontrol him, instead of the fatigue.\nIt would catch up to him eventually. But for now, he could pretend to be\nstrong. Pretend to be a soldier again.\nThe four guards were facing in the other direction, so Kaladin—running\nat full speed—nearly reached them before the first guard spun around.\nKaladin took the chance to burst alight with power, earning him another\nfraction of a second as the guard panicked, his eyes going wide with fright.\nHe shouted as Kaladin drew close, hands out before him, waiting for the\nthrust of the spear. A lot of men were afraid of something sharp coming at\nthem, but as long as his Stormlight held, Kaladin’s only real danger was\ngetting outnumbered and overwhelmed.\nKaladin caught the spear as the singer thrust it. He then yanked,\nthrowing the enemy off balance. He’d been taught that maneuver by Hav,\nwho said it was necessary to learn, but almost impossible to execute.\nKaladin added his own twist by infusing the shaft with a Full Lashing,\nmaking it stick to the guard’s hands. Then he shoved the weapon to the side,\nsticking it to a second guard’s spear as he spun.\nKaladin grabbed that spear, infusing it as well, then left both guards\nstuck to their weapons. As they shouted in surprise, Kaladin held the shafts\nof the crossed spears—one in each hand—and shoved them upward so the\ntips struck the ceiling. Then he smoothly ducked through the peaked\nopening, leaving the two men crying out and struggling as they tried\nunsuccessfully to free their weapons and hands.\nKaladin slammed his shoulder into the third guard, infusing the singer’s\ncoat with a slap to the back.

He shoved this guard into the fourth. They fell\nin a lump, entangled and stuck together. Kaladin danced on his toes,\nawaiting the next attack. It didn’t come. The singers stayed where he’d put\nthem, shouting and railing as they struggled to move.\nHe kicked a spear up and seized it out of the air. Hello, old friend. I keep\nfinding my way back to you, don’t I? Perhaps it wasn’t Teft’s addiction he\nneeded to worry about. There was always an excuse for why Kaladin\nneeded the spear again, wasn’t there?\nThis was what he’d been afraid of. This was what made him tremble.\nThe worry that he would never be able to put it down.\nHe tucked the spear under his arm and took off through the tunnel. A\ntwinkling garnet light appeared on the floor in front of him, moving along\none of the strata, leading the way toward a stairwell ahead.\n“No,” Kaladin said, hoping the tower’s spren could hear him. “There\nwill be a guard post at the bottom. I can already hear them responding to\nthose shouts. To reach the second floor, we go out a perimeter balcony,\ndown the outside, and then head inward. That will lose any tails we pick\nup.”\nThe spren seemed to have heard, for they sent a light moving along the\nwall next to him—opposite Syl’s blue-white ribbon on his other side. They\nreached the balcony in a few short minutes, a fraction of the time it had\ntaken to sneak inward. They were at the rim of the tower, but the central\natrium was far at the eastern side. All the way inward. He’d have to cross\nthe entire second floor to reach it.\nHe heard shouts behind him, so he’d been right about picking up tails.\nHe stuck his spear to his back by infusing part of it and slapping it against\nhis shirt, then he unwound the rope around his waist. A quick infusion on\nthe end let him stick it to the railing as he stepped up in a fluid motion and\nleaped off, sticking the other end to his shirt in case he slipped, then holding\ntight.\nHe swung out and around, then onto the balcony below. This one,\nunfortunately, was occupied. So after he recovered his rope, he charged\nthrough a family’s room—leaping and sliding across their dinner table. He\nwas out the door a moment later, spear in hand. He heard a distant shout of\nanger from outside the balcony, as the singers above realized he’d gone a\nway they couldn’t follow.\nThe tower’s spren found him here and began guiding him. The strata and\nlines of crystal didn’t always run directly down the corridors, so sometimes\nthe light would spiral around him, following the grain of the stone. Other\ntimes the light would vanish when there was no direct path for it, but it\nwould always appear ahead of him again, glowing on the floor or wall,\nurging him onward.\nHe drew attention, naturally. The late hour meant that he didn’t\nencounter crowds to slow him, but it also meant there wasn’t much else to\ndistract the guard patrols. He infused and tossed his spear at a pair of guards"

He infused and tossed his spear at a pair of guards\nwho stumbled into the hallway ahead of him—then stole one of their\ndropped weapons as they struggled and cursed, trying to get his old weapon\nto stop sticking to their fingers.\nThe next set weren’t so easily defeated. He found them organizing\nhastily at an intersection—one he had to pass through, or endure a long\ndetour. Kaladin slowed in the corridor, watching them form up with nets in\nhand. His first instinct was to take to the walls and disorient them. But of\ncourse he didn’t have access to that ability—he suspected it would be a long\ntime before he internalized that gravitational Lashings didn’t work.\nHe took his spear in a one-handed grip, the butt tucked under his arm,\nthen nodded to Syl. Together, they rushed the blockade. A few soldiers had\ncrossbows, so he infused the wall with his free hand. When those loosed,\nthe bolts swerved toward the stone.\nThe group with the nets hung back behind singers with axes. The\nweapons reminded him of the Parshendi, but the singers were dressed like\nthe Azish, with colorful coats, no gemstones woven into the malens’ beards.\nThey knew how to fight Radiants. The axe wielders came in quickly,\nforcing him to engage, and then the nets started flying. Kaladin swiped one\naway with his spear, but that exposed him, and an axe bit him in the side—\nthe kind of wound that would spell death for an ordinary soldier.\nKaladin pulled himself free of the axe, the biting pain fading as his\nStormlight healed him, but another net came soaring overhead. They\nwouldn’t mind if they caught some of their number in it, so long as they\ntangled Kaladin long enough for them to start hacking at him.\nFeeling his solitude more than ever, Kaladin dodged the net by\nretreating. He wanted to infuse one of the nets and stick it to the floor so it\ncouldn’t be recovered, but he couldn’t bend over to touch it.\nMaybe I should remove my boots, he thought. That idea flew counter to\nall of his training, but he didn’t fight like he once had. These days, a\nstubbed toe would be healed instantly—while being able to infuse the\nground he walked on would be a huge advantage.\nHe kept the singers at bay with some careful lunges, then backed up\nbefore a net could catch him. Unfortunately, this group was probably meant\nto stall him while Regals and Fused could be mustered. It was working\nperfectly. Without a Shardblade, Kaladin was far from unstoppable. He was\nforced away until he reached another intersection.\n“Kaladin,” Syl said, hovering beside his head as a ribbon of light. “To\nyour left.”\nHe spared a glance to see a flashing garnet light on the wall farther down\nthe left-hand corridor. Well, he certainly wasn’t going to push through these\nsoldiers anytime soon. He took off in a dash toward the light, and the\nsoldiers—rightly timid when facing a Radiant—followed more cautiously.\nThat gave Kaladin time to kick open a door, following the light, and enter\nan upscale glassmaker’s shop."

He leaped over it and infused the stone, and\nwas rewarded as the wall parted. He slipped through the opening, then set\nthe thing closing behind him.\nThis put him in a second, larger shop, filled with half-finished dressing\ndummies. He startled a late-night worker, a human with a Thaylen naval\nmustache and curled eyebrows. He dropped his adze and leaped to his feet,\nthen clapped his hands.\n“Brightlord Stormblessed!” he exclaimed.\n“Quietly,” Kaladin said, crossing the room and cracking the door to peek\nout. “You need to hide. When they come asking, you didn’t see me.”\nThe hallway outside was clear, and Kaladin was pretty sure he knew\nwhere he was. This shortcut had completely circumvented the blockade.\nHopefully that would confuse the soldiers as they tried to track him.\nKaladin moved to sneak out the door, but the woodworker caught him by\nthe arm.\n“Radiant,” he said. “How? How do you still fight?”\n“The same way you do,” Kaladin said. “One day at a time, always taking\nthe next step.” He took the man’s wrist with his hand. “Don’t get yourself\nkilled. But also don’t give up hope.”\nThe man nodded.\n“Hide,” Kaladin said. “They’ll come searching for me.”\nHe pulled free and joined Syl. After about ten minutes of jogging, he\nheard shouting to his right, but nobody came running—and he realized\nwhere they thought he was heading: to a set of stairs that led directly toward\nthe larger stairwell, which in turn led to the basement. They thought he was\ntrying to rescue the queen, or maybe reach the crystal pillar.\nTheir error let him follow some back pathways without meeting any\npatrols, until he finally drew near the atrium. He’d managed to cross the\nentire floor, but he was now so deeply embedded within the tower that he\nwas essentially surrounded.\nThe light led him around to the northern side of the tower, through some\nresidential hallways, with lights under the doors. Rooms near the atrium and\nits grand window were popular—here, people could still see sunlight, but\nthe atrium was generally warmer than the perimeter, with easy access to\nlifts.\nThe area was unnaturally silent, perhaps under curfew. He was used to\nthe atrium region being alive with the sound of people talking all hours of\nthe day, the lifts clanking faintly as they moved. Tonight it was hushed. He\ncrept along the tower spren’s path, wondering when he’d find resistance.\nSurely someone would have put together what he was doing. Surely they\nwould …\nHe stopped in the hallway as he saw bright light ahead. He could have\nsworn he’d reached the furthermost edge of the tower, the place near the\nenormous glass window that looked out to the east. There shouldn’t be any\nmore rooms here, but ahead and to his right, moonlight spilled through an\nopening."

There shouldn’t be any\nmore rooms here, but ahead and to his right, moonlight spilled through an\nopening.\nHe inched up to find the area strewn with rubble. A secret door in the\nwall had been broken open; when he peeked through, he saw a short tunnel\nthat ended at open air. This was the eastern wall of the tower, the flat side of\nUrithiru. The secret tunnel here was old, not newly cut, and had been\ncreated open to the air of the mountains.\nThe Pursuer was here, standing with another Fused and inspecting a\nstrange device at the end of the short tunnel, right where it ended and\nopened to the air. A glowing sapphire, easily as large as a chasmfiend’s\ngemheart, had been set into a built-in stand rising from the floor. The entire\nmechanism was covered over in crem, so it had been here a while, and the\nFused had needed to break off a crem crust to reach the gemstone.\nThe implication struck Kaladin immediately. As the Sibling had hinted, a\nnode to defend the tower had been placed where it could draw in Stormlight\nnaturally from the storms, when they reached this high. The unfamiliar\nFused was a tall femalen with a topknot of red-orange hair. She wore\npractical battle gear, leather and cloth, and stood with her hands clasped\nbehind her back as she inspected the sapphire.\nThe other was, as he’d noted earlier, the Pursuer. A hulking mountain of\nchitin and dark brown cloth, with eyes glowing a deep red. All of the\nspheres had been removed from the lanterns in the hallway behind Kaladin,\nso the only light came from the sapphire.\n“See?” the femalen said in Alethi as they spotted Kaladin. “I told you\nhe’d come. I keep my promises, Pursuer. He’s yours.”\nThe red eyes focused on Kaladin, then went dark as a ribbon of crimson\nlight burst from the center of the Pursuer’s mass. The body—a discarded\nhusk—collapsed to the floor. Kaladin raised his spear, gauging where the\nPursuer would land. He thrust on instinct, hoping to catch the Fused as he\nmaterialized.\nThis time, however, the Pursuer’s ribbon jogged and looped a few times,\ndisorienting Kaladin. He thrust again, missing the mark as the Pursuer\ncoalesced to the side of Kaladin’s spear. The creature lunged for Kaladin,\nwho danced backward into the darkened hallway outside the tunnel.\nThe creature stepped into the broken doorway. So, Kaladin infused his\nspear and tossed it at the Pursuer—who reflexively caught it. That stuck his\nhands to the spear, and Kaladin leaped forward and shoved himself against\nthe Fused, getting him to step backward. The two ends of the spear stuck to\nthe walls on either side of the opening.\nKaladin leaped away, leaving the creature partially immobilized,\nawkwardly trying to move with both hands locked into place.

He was too unpracticed with this kind of\nfighting—and this kind of opponent. What had worked on the soldiers was a\nfoolish move here. He lunged to grab his spear, but it fell beneath the\ncollapsing husk.\nThe Pursuer materialized directly behind Kaladin, grabbing him with\npowerful hands, preventing him from reaching the spear. It was a poor\nweapon for this fight anyway. The Pursuer obviously excelled at getting in\nclose.\nKaladin twisted, trying to wrench free, but the Pursuer gripped him in a\nprecise hold, executed perfectly, immobilizing both of Kaladin’s arms. The\ncreature then pushed, using his superior weight to knock Kaladin to his\nknees.\nThe Pursuer didn’t try to choke Kaladin. The creature didn’t even release\nhim with one hand to grab a knife, as he had during their previous fight. All\nthe Pursuer had to do was hold Kaladin still until his Stormlight ran out.\nThey were deep within the tower, surrounded by other singers and Fused.\nThe longer this fight lasted, the worse it would go for Kaladin.\nHe struggled, trying to pull free. In response, the Pursuer leaned in and\nspoke with a thick accent. “I will kill you. It is my right. I have killed every\nperson—human or singer—who has ever killed me.”\nKaladin tried to roll them both to the side, but the Pursuer held them\nstable.\n“No one has ever defeated me twice,” the creature whispered. “But if\nyou somehow managed such a feat, I would keep coming. We are no longer\nconfined to Braize at the end of the war, and I am immortal. I can follow\nyou forever. I am the spren of vengeance.”\nKaladin tried to infuse his opponent, as he might have with a\ngravitational Lashing. The Light resisted, but that wasn’t surprising. Fused\nhad powers of their own, and for some reason that made them difficult to\ninfuse.\nSo he instead stretched and brushed the floor with one hand, infusing the\nstone. It trapped the Pursuer’s feet, but it also stuck to Kaladin’s boots,\nlocking them together.\n“Let go now,” the Pursuer said. “Die, as is your right. You will never be\nable to sleep soundly again, little Radiant. I will always come, always hunt\nyou. As sure as the storms. I will—”\n“Put him down!” a stern voice said as a red spren strode across the floor.\n“Right now! We need him. You can kill him after!”\nThe Pursuer relaxed his grip, perhaps stunned to be given an order by a\nVoidspren. Kaladin elbowed the Pursuer in the chin—which hurt like a\nhammer to the elbow—forcing the creature to let go. That let Kaladin lunge\nforward and recover some Stormlight by brushing the floor, which in turn\nset his feet free. He scrambled away, leaving enough Stormlight infused in\nthe floor to keep the Pursuer planted in place.\nThe creature focused on Syl. “You lie well, for an honorspren,” he said.\nHis body crumbled, his ribbon vanishing around a corner.

Either that, or catch him by surprise and kill\nhim before he could eject, which was what Kaladin had done before.\n“Thanks,” Kaladin said as Syl turned blue again.

He waved for them to close their doors, then\nhopped through the rubble and dashed toward the Fused at the end of the\nsecret tunnel.\nAs he approached, he spotted a glass globe, perhaps six inches in\ndiameter, set into a small alcove in the wall near the gemstone. At first he\nthought it was some kind of lighting fixture, but it was wrapped in metal\nwires like a fabrial. What on Roshar?\nHe didn’t have time to inspect it further, for the Fused was pressing her\nhand against the sapphire. The gemstone’s light had started to fade.\nShe’s corrupting the pillar, Kaladin thought, using this as a conduit to\ntouch it. He leveled his spear at her.\nShe stopped and turned to regard him. “The Pursuer isn’t lying,” she said\nin accented Alethi. “He will hunt you forever. To the abandonment of all\nreason and duty.”\n“Step away from the gemstone,” Kaladin said.\n“He’ll return shortly,” she noted. “You should flee. He has placed\nVoidlight gemstones in stashes nearby, so he can reinfuse himself and make\nnew bodies.”\n“I said step away.”\n“You’re a Windrunner,” she said. “You won’t hurt me if I’m not a\nthreat.”\n“Touching that gemstone makes you a threat. Step away.”\nShe did, which meant walking toward him, clasping her hands behind\nher. “What is it, do you suppose, that makes you able to continue using your\npowers? I’ll admit, I had worried about the Windrunners. They say your\nSurges are closest to Honor.”\nKaladin gripped his spear, uncertain what to do. Stab her? He had to\nprotect the gemstone.\nOr destroy it, he thought. Storms, that would weaken the shield Navani\nhad set up—and if the enemy had found this one so quickly, how long\nwould it be until they discovered the others? He glanced to Syl on his\nshoulder, and she shook her head. She didn’t know what to do either.\n“Ah,” the Fused said. “He’s back. On with you, then.”\nKaladin risked looking over his shoulder, cursing as he saw a distinctly\nbloodred ribbon of light approaching. Making a snap decision, Kaladin\ndropped his spear and pulled out his scalpel. Then he quickly sliced the\nlaces on his boots.\nThe Pursuer appeared inside the tunnel and grabbed for him, but Kaladin\nbent—dodging the grip—and infused the floor with a Full Lashing. Then he"

Then he\nleaped forward around the Pursuer, leaving his shoes stuck to the stone. The\nPursuer couldn’t help but land on that floor, trapping him in place.\nKaladin held out his scalpel, barefoot as he backed up into the rubble of\nthe broken wall that had been opened. The Pursuer eyed him, remaining\nrooted on the ground. Then he grinned and left his body, shooting toward\nKaladin.\nKaladin retreated through the opening into the outer corridor, infusing\nthe floor again, using up a large amount of his Stormlight. He was able to\nroll away from the Pursuer’s next attack, which again left the creature\nrooted. But Kaladin couldn’t step forward and reclaim the Light he’d used,\nnot without getting within the Pursuer’s reach.\nHis Stormlight was almost gone, something the Pursuer had clearly\nfigured out. The creature left his second body, the first already starting to\ncrumble. When Kaladin leaped forward to try to retrieve his Stormlight, the\nPursuer darted at him as a ribbon of light—like a snapping eel—and\nKaladin retreated.\nThe two watched one another in the dark corridor. The Pursuer could\nonly form one more body before he’d need to renew his Voidlight, or risk\nfighting in his fourth body and perhaps being killed. But Kaladin’s Light\nwas low—and he didn’t have a quick way to get more.\nStorms. The other Fused—the femalen—had returned to the gemstone\nand was working on it again.\n“We have to destroy it, Kaladin,” Syl whispered.\nShe was right. He couldn’t defend this place on his own. He’d simply\nhave to hope that the other nodes were better hidden. Though … how could\nsomething be better hidden than in the middle of a wall?\nKaladin took a deep breath, then dashed forward to force the Pursuer to\nmaterialize. He did so—but only after zipping back into the center of the\nsecond pool of Light Kaladin had made. That let the creature materialize\nstanding on the remnants of his second husk, which was stuck to the Light.\nThe Fused crouched low, hands out and ready to grab Kaladin if he tried\nto run past. Kaladin was forced to shy back.\nI can’t afford to fight him the way he wants, Kaladin thought. If he gets\nme into his grip, I’ll end up pinned.\nWhen he’d killed the creature before, Kaladin had used the Pursuer’s\nassumptions against him. This time he wasn’t making the same mistake, but\nhe was still so very confident.\nUse that. Let him defeat himself.\nKaladin turned and started running in the opposite direction.\nBehind, the Pursuer began laughing. “That’s right, human! Flee! You see\nit now! Run and be pursued.”\nSyl zipped up alongside Kaladin. “What’s the plan?”\n“He’s called the Pursuer,” Kaladin said. “He loves the chase. When we\nwere doing what humans shouldn’t do—trying to fight him—he was\ndeliberate and careful. Now we’re fleeing prey. He might get sloppy. But he"

But he\nwon’t leave that third body until we’re far enough away that he’s sure we\nwon’t just double back and attack that other Fused. Go warn me when he\ndoes.”\n“Right.” She darted off to watch.\nKaladin took a few turns in the corridor, then said, “Tower spren, I need\nyou!” A garnet light ahead started flashing quickly as if anxious.\nKaladin jogged to it, and Syl came darting back. “The Pursuer is\nrecharging—but he’s not leaving the fabrial unwatched! He’s getting\nVoidlight from the other Fused.”\nKaladin nodded as he pressed his hand to the wall. The tower spren\nspoke in his mind.\nSheiskillingmeSheiskillingmeSheiskillingme. Stopitstopit.\n“I’m trying,” Kaladin said. He dug out some of his gemstones, then\ninfused his Stormlight into them to preserve what he had left. “I’m not\nconvinced I can beat that monster again. Not without a team on a battlefield.\nHe fights too well one-on-one. So, I need another hidden room. One with\nonly a single exit—and with a door that will open and close fast.”\nYou’re going to hide? the Sibling said, hysterical. You can’t—\n“I won’t abandon you, but you need to do this for me. We don’t have\nmuch time. Please.”\n“Kaladin!” Syl said. “He’s coming!”\nKaladin cursed, leaving the Sibling and dashing for an intersection in the\ndark corridors ahead.\n“Duck!” Syl said.\nKaladin ducked, narrowly avoiding the Pursuer’s grip as he materialized.\nAs Kaladin darted a different direction, the creature tried again, dropping a\nhusk and shooting ahead of Kaladin.\nTrying to play the part of panicked prey, Kaladin turned and ran the other\nway—though he hated putting his back to the creature like that. He could\nalmost feel him, forming with arms grabbing at Kaladin’s neck.…\nAs he dashed through the corridor, people who had been watching\nsnapped their doors shut. Behind him, the Pursuer laughed. Yes, he\nunderstood this kind of fight. He enjoyed it. “Run!” he shouted. “Run, little\nhuman!”\nAhead, garnet light flashed, then began moving down a side hallway.\nKaladin scrambled that direction as Syl warned him the Pursuer was\ncoming. The garnet light, fortunately, moved up a wall straight ahead, then\nflashed, revealing a gemstone hidden in the rock. Kaladin drew in the Light\nof one of his spheres and infused the gemstone, making the door begin to\nopen. It was faster than previous ones, as he’d asked.\nSyl cried, “He’s almost here!”\n“As soon as I walk in,” Kaladin whispered to the tower’s spren, “start\nclosing the door. Then lock it.”\nHe glanced back, and saw the red light rapidly approaching. So, taking a\ndeep breath, Kaladin ducked through the once-hidden doorway.

He made it look like he\nintended to stand and fight.\nGo for my back again, like you’ve done before. Please.\nThe ribbon danced in over his head. Kaladin leaped forward, squeezing\nthrough the tight doorway as it closed, right as the Pursuer appeared in the\nroom behind him.\nKaladin fell forward and scrambled across the ground. Behind him, the\ndoor thumped closed. He waited, his heart thundering in his chest, as he\nturned and watched the doorway. Would the Pursuer’s ribbon be small\nenough to squeeze through? These hidden doors sealed so tightly they were\nalmost impossible to see from the outside, and Syl had physical form as a\nribbon. He assumed the same rules applied to the Pursuer.\nSyl flitted down beside him, taking the shape of a young woman in a\nBridge Four uniform. She colored it a dark blue.\nQuiet. Followed by a yell of rage, muffled to near silence by the\nintervening stone. Kaladin grinned, picking himself up. He thought he heard\nthe Pursuer yell, “Coward!”\nHe gave the closed door a salute, then turned to jog back the way he had\ncome. Again he had to hiss at people to close their doors and stay out of\nsight. Where was their sense of self-preservation?\nTheir eyes were hopeful when they saw him. And in those expressions,\nhe understood why they had to look, regardless of the danger. They thought\neveryone had been conquered and controlled, but here was a Radiant. Their\nhopes pressed on him as he finally reached the hidden tunnel. The femalen\nFused with the topknot stood in a posture of concentration, her hand pressed\nagainst the sapphire.\nShe didn’t seem to be corrupting it. Indeed, she had brought out a large\ndiamond and was holding it up to the sapphire—drawing light from it.\nStormlight, it seemed, although it was tinged faintly the wrong color.\nKaladin scooped a piece of broken rubble from the floor. The sides of the\nrubble were smoothly cut. The work of a Shardblade.\nKaladin leaped forward and shoved the Fused back, trying to knock her\noff the cliff. That caused her to exclaim and fall out of her trance, though\nshe grabbed a protruding rock and prevented herself from falling.\nBefore she could stop him, Kaladin slammed his rubble into the\ngemstone, cracking it. That was enough—cracked gemstones couldn’t hold\nStormlight—but he slammed it a few more times to be certain, breaking the\nsapphire free of its housing and sending it tumbling into the void outside.\nIt vanished into darkness, plummeting hundreds upon hundreds of feet\ndown the sheer cliff toward the rocks far below. Kaladin felt something\nwhen it broke free. A faint sense that the darkness in the tower had grown\nstronger—or perhaps Kaladin was only now recognizing the results of the\nFused’s recent attempt at corrupting the tower.\nHe puffed out, the deed done, and backed away.

In that moment though\n—his Stormlight running low, his energy deflating, the darkness growing\nstronger—he flagged. He reached out for the wall as his vision wavered,\nand the fatigue seemed to be almost too much.\nA shadow moved in front of him, and he forced himself alert—but not\nbefore the Fused in the topknot managed to ram a knife into his chest. He\nfelt an immediate spike of pain and pulled out his scalpel, but the Fused\njumped back before he could strike.\nPainspren wriggled up from the stone as Kaladin stumbled, bleeding. He\ndrew in the last of his Stormlight and pressed his hand to the wound.\nStorms. His mind … was fuzzy. And the darkness seemed so strong.\nThe Fused, however, didn’t seem interested in striking again. She tucked\naway her knife and laced her fingers before herself, watching him. Oddly,\nhe noticed that the glass sphere that had been in the little stone alcove was\ngone. Where had the Fused put it?\n“You continue to heal,” she noted. “And I saw the use of Adhesion\nearlier. I assume from the way you move, confined to the ground, that\nGravitation has abandoned you. Does your hybrid power work? The one\nyour kind often uses to direct arrows in flight?”\nKaladin didn’t respond. He gripped his scalpel, waiting to heal. The pain\nlingered. Was healing slower than usual? “What did you to do me?” he\ndemanded, hoarse. “Was that blade poisoned?”\n“No,” she said. “I merely wanted to inspect your healing. It seems to be\nlethargic, does it not? Hmmm…”\nHe didn’t like how she looked at him, so discerning and interested—like\na surgeon inspecting a corpse before a dissection. She didn’t seem to care\nthat he had destroyed her chance at corrupting the tower—perhaps because\nKaladin’s attack had furthered her eventual goal of reaching the crystal\npillar.\nHe raised his scalpel, waiting for his storming wound to heal. It\ncontinued to do so. Languidly.\n“If you kill me,” the Fused noted, “I will simply be reborn. I will choose\nthe most innocent among the singers of the tower. A mother perhaps, with a\nchild precisely old enough to understand the pain of loss—but not old\nenough to understand why her mother now rejects her.”\nKaladin growled despite himself, stepping forward.\n“Yes,” the femalen said. “A true Windrunner, all the way to your\ngemheart. Fascinating. You had no continuity of spren or traditions from the\nold ones, I’m led to believe. Yet the same attitudes, the same structures,\narise naturally—like the lattice of a growing crystal.”\nKaladin growled again, sliding to the side toward his discarded spear and\nshoes.\n“You should go,” the Fused said. “If you’ve killed the Pursuer again, it\nwill make for quite the stir among my kind. I don’t believe that’s ever been\naccomplished. Regardless, I have Fused and Regals on their way to join us\nand finish his work. You might escape them, if you leave now.”"

But he thought better of it\nand fled into the corridors—his side aching—trusting in the tower spren and\nSyl to guide him out of danger and to a safe hiding place.\nWho is this person? You used no title, so I assume they are not a\nFused. Who, then, is El?\n—From Rhythm of War, page 10 undertext\nVenli felt all rhythms freeze when she saw Rlain in the cell. Like the silence\nfollowing a crescendo.\nIn that silence, Venli finally believed what Mazish had told her. In that\nsilence, all of Roshar changed. Venli was no longer the last. And in that\nsilence, Venli thought she could hear something distant beyond the rhythms.\nA pure tone.\nRlain looked up through the bars, then sneered at her.\nThe moment of peace vanished. He’d picked up some human\nexpressions, it seemed. Did he recognize her in this form? Her skin patterns\nwere the same, but she and Rlain had never been close. He likely saw only\nan unfamiliar Regal.\nVenli retreated down the hallway, passing several empty cells with bars\non the doors. It was the day after the incident with Stormblessed and the\ndestruction of the node. Venli had been on her way to visit Rlain when the\nevent had occurred, drawing her away to attend her master.\nCuriously, though Venli had assumed that Raboniel would be furious,\ninstead she’d taken it in stride. She’d almost seemed amused at what had\noccurred. She was hiding something about her motivations. She seemed to\nnot want the corruption to happen too quickly.\nAt any rate, dealing with the aftermath of the incident had involved Venli\ninterpreting late into the night for various Fused. It hadn’t been until this\nmorning that she’d been able to break away and come check on what\nMazish had told her.\nRlain. Alive.\nNear the door, Venli met with the head jailer: a direform Regal with a\ncrest of spikes beginning on his head and running down his neck.\n“I didn’t realize we had a prison,” she said to him—softly, and to\nIndifference.\n“The humans built it,” he replied, also to Indifference. “I interviewed\nseveral of the workers here. They claim they were keeping the assassin in\nhere.”\n“The assassin?”\n“Indeed. He vanished right before we arrived.”\n“He should have fallen unconscious.”\n“Well, he didn’t, and nobody has seen anything of him.”\n“You should have told me of this earlier,” Venli said. “The Lady thinks\nthat certain Radiants might still be able to function in the tower. It’s\npossible this one is out there somewhere, preparing to kill.”\nThe direform hummed to Abashment. “Well, we’ve been prepping this\nplace in case we need to lock up a Regal with proper comforts. We’ve got a\nlarger brig for human prisoners. Figured this would be a good place for your\nfriend there, until official word arrived.”"

Figured this would be a good place for your\nfriend there, until official word arrived.”\nVenli glanced along the hall of empty cells, lit by topaz lanterns hanging\nfrom the ceiling. They gave the chamber a soft brown warmth, the color of\ncremstone.\n“Why did you lock him away?” she asked.\n“He’s an essai,” the direform said to Derision, using an ancient word\nthey’d picked up from the Fused. It meant something along the lines of\n“human lover,” though her form told her it technically meant “hairy.”\n“He was a spy my people sent to watch them.”\n“Then he betrayed you,” the direform said. “He claims he’d been held by\nthe humans against his will, but it didn’t take much asking around to find\nthe truth. He was friendly with the Radiants—was their servant or\nsomething. Could have left at any time, but stayed. Wanted to keep being a\nslave, I guess.” He changed to the Rhythm of Executions—a rarely used\nrhythm.\n“I will speak with him,” Venli said. “Alone.”\nThe direform studied her, humming to Destruction in challenge. She\nhummed it back—she outranked this one, so long as she was Raboniel’s\nVoice.\n“I will send again to the Lady of Wishes,” he finally said, “to inform her\nthat you have done this.”\n“As you will,” Venli said, then waited pointedly until he stepped out and\nshut the door. Venli glanced into Shadesmar, as she’d grown into the habit\nof doing, though she’d learned Voidspren couldn’t hide in the tower. It was\ninstinct by now. And she—\nWait. There was a Voidspren here.\nIt was hiding in the body of a cremling. Most spren could enter bodies, if\nthey couldn’t pass through other solid objects. She wasn’t terribly familiar\nwith all the varieties of Voidspren, but this one must have realized that it\ncouldn’t hide in the tower as it once had, so used this method to remain\nunseen.\nShe attuned Anxiety, and Timbre agreed. Was it watching her, or Rlain?\nOr was it simply here to patrol? Had she done anything recently that would\ngive her away?\nShe maintained her composure, pretending to think as she strolled in the\nprison chamber. Then she pretended to notice the cremling for the first time,\nthen shooed it away. The thing scuttled down the wall and out under the\ndoor. She glanced into Shadesmar, and saw the Voidspren—through the\nhundreds of shimmering colors that made up the tower—retreating into the\ndistance alongside the tiny speck of light that represented the cremling.\nThat left her nervous enough that she paced a few times—and checked\nagain—before finally she forced herself to return to the cell. “Rlain.”\nHe looked up at her. Then he frowned and stood.\n“It’s me,” she said to Peace, speaking in the listener language for an\nextra measure of privacy. “Venli.”\nHe stepped closer to the bars, and his eyes flickered to her face. He\nhummed to Remembrance. “I was under the impression they had killed all\nof the listeners.”"

Last we knew, the\nhumans had discovered you in the warcamps and executed you!”\n“I … wasn’t discovered,” he said. He spoke to Curiosity, but his body\nlanguage—he had indeed picked up some human attitudes—betrayed his\ntrue emotions. He obviously didn’t trust her. “I was made an example, used\nas an experiment. They put me in the bridge crews. I don’t think anyone\never suspected I was a spy. They just thought I was too smart for a\nparshman.”\n“You’ve been living among them all this time? That guard says you’re an\ness—a human sympathizer. I can’t believe you’re alive, and I’m not the … I\nmean…” Language failed her, and she ended up standing there, humming\nthe Rhythm of the Lost and feeling like an idiot. Timbre chimed in, giving\nthe same rhythm—and that helped somehow.\nRlain studied her. He’d probably heard that forms of power changed a\nperson’s personality—storms … they’d always known that. Known they\nwere dangerous.\n“Rlain,” she said, her voice soft, “I’m me. Truly me. This form\ndoesn’t … change me like stormform did for the others.”\nTimbre pulsed. Tell him the truth. Show him what you are.\nShe locked up. No. She couldn’t.\n“The others?” he asked, hopeful. “Remala? Eshonai? She fought Adolin,\nwe think, in battle. Do you know … if she is…”\n“I saw my sister’s corpse myself at the bottom of the chasms,” she said\nto Pain. “There aren’t any others left but me. He … Odium took them, made\nthem into Fused. He saved me because he wanted me to tell stories about\nour people, use them to inspire the newly freed singers. But I think he was\nafraid of us, as a group. So he destroyed us.”\nShe hummed to the Rhythm of the Lost again. Rlain eventually joined\nher and stepped forward until he was right beside the bars.\n“I’m sorry, Venli,” he eventually said. “That must have been awful.”\nHe doesn’t know, she realized, that I caused all this. How could he? He\nwas among the humans. To him, I’m simply … another survivor.\nShe found that idea daunting.\n“You need to free me,” Rlain said. “I hoped they’d accept my story, but\nI’m too well known in the tower. You stand out when you’re the only\n‘parshman’ anyone knows.”\n“I’ll see what I can do,” Venli said to Reconciliation. “The guard doesn’t\ntrust me—a lot of them don’t—and talking to you will make that worse. If I\ndo get you out, what are you going to do? You won’t get me into trouble,\nwill you?”\nHe frowned at her, then hummed to Irritation.\n“You are a human sympathizer,” Venli said.\n“They’re my friends,” he said. “My family, now.

We’re\ngoing to need this tower.”\n“Do we want to defeat Odium?” Venli asked. “A lot of people like the\nway things are going, Rlain. We have a nation of our own—not a few\nshacks in a backwater countryside, but a real nation with cities, roads,\ninfrastructure. Things—I might add—that were largely built by the efforts\nof enslaved singers. The humans don’t deserve our loyalty or even an\nalliance. Not after what they did.”\nRlain didn’t object immediately. Instead he hummed to Tension. “We\nfind ourselves caught, literally, between two storms,” he finally said. “But if\nI’m going to pick one to walk through, Venli, I’ll pick the highstorm. That\nwas once our storm. The spren were our allies. And yes, the humans tried to\nexploit the listeners, then tried to destroy us—but the Fused are the ones\nwho succeeded. Odium chose to destroy our people. I’m not going to serve\nhim. I…”\nHe trailed off, perhaps realizing what he was saying. He’d tried to start\nthe conversation noncommittal, plainly worried she was an agent for\nOdium. Now he’d confirmed where he stood. He looked to her, and his\nhumming fell silent. Waiting.\n“I don’t know if any good can be done by fighting him, Rlain,” she\nwhispered. “But I … keep secrets from Odium myself. I’ve been trying to\nbuild something separate from his rule, a people I could … I don’t know,\nuse to start a new group of listeners.”\nTrying, in her own pitiful way, to undo what she’d done.\n“How many?” Rlain asked, to Excitement.\n“A dozen so far,” Venli said. “I have them watching over the fallen\nRadiants. I have some authority in the tower, but I don’t know how far it\nwill extend. It’s complicated. The various Fused have different motivations,\nand I’m wrapped up in the threads of it all. I helped save some humans who\nwere going to be executed—but I’m not interested in allying with them in\ngeneral.”\n“Who did you save? The queen?”\n“No, someone far less important,” Venli said. “A surgeon and his wife,\nwho were—”\n“Lirin and Hesina?” he asked to Excitement. “The child too, I hope.”\n“Yes. How did you—”\n“You need to get me out, Venli,” Rlain said. “And get me to Hesina. I\nhave something useful I could show her—and you, if you want to help.”\n“I’ve been trying to tell you,” Venli whispered, glancing over her\nshoulder at the door. “I have some authority, but there are many who\ndistrust me.

By asking around, Venli\nfound that she was for some reason at the Blackthorn’s former rooms.\nVenli stepped inside, where an unusual number of Fused had gathered\nand were systematically going through the warlord’s belongings—\ncataloguing them, making notations about them, and packing them away.\nVenli passed through and saw one crate contained socks: each pair recorded\nand carefully stored.\nThey were putting all of his things into storage, but why had they\ndedicated Fused to such a mundane job? What was more, these were\nimportant Fused, none of the more erratic or crazy represented. Leshwi\nherself had been pressed into the work, and that all together whispered\nsomething meaningful: Someone very high up in the singer hierarchy was\ninterested in this man. To the point of wanting to dissect and understand his\neach and every possession, no matter how ordinary.\nVenli moved around the perimeter of the room, careful to stay away from\nthe broad doors or windows leading to the balcony. Those had been draped\noff, but the rules were strict during daylight hours. No singers were to show\nthemselves outside, lest they accidentally reveal the truth to Windrunner\nscouts.\nShe found two humans she didn’t recognize at the doorway into the\nbedroom, watching what occurred inside. There, Raboniel was speaking to\na third human. The tall male was dressed in a coat and trousers that seemed\nelegant to Venli’s eyes—though she knew little of their fashion. More\nstriking was the strange creature on his shoulder, an odd thing unlike any\nVenli had ever seen. It stood on two legs like a person, though its face\nended in a beak and it had brightly colored scales that looked soft, of all\nthings. When she entered, it turned and stared at her, and she was unnerved\nby how bright and intelligent its eyes seemed.\nThe Lady of Wishes sat in a chair by the bed, her face passive, with\nstacks of papers and books beside her.\nWho was this man, and why would Raboniel pause her research to give\nhim an audience? The Lady normally ignored requests from humans, going\nso far as to have several “important” ones flogged when they demanded\naudiences. More curious, as Venli edged around the side of the room, she\nsaw that the man’s face was scarred in several places, bespeaking a\nroughness in contrast to his fine clothing."

More curious, as Venli edged around the side of the room, she\nsaw that the man’s face was scarred in several places, bespeaking a\nroughness in contrast to his fine clothing.\n“The only thing I find remarkable,” Raboniel said to Derision, “is how\naudacious you are, human. Do you not understand how easily I could have\nyou beaten or killed?”\n“That would be to throw away a useful opportunity,” the man said, loud\nand bold—a human version of the Rhythm of Determination. “And you are\nnot one who throws away something useful, are you, Ancient One?”\n“Use is relative,” Raboniel replied. “I will throw away an opportunity\nI’ll never have time to exploit if it is preventing me from something better.”\n“What is better than free riches?” he said.\n“I have Urithiru,” she said. “What need have I of spheres?”\n“Not that kind of riches,” the man said, with a smile. He stepped forward\nand respectfully handed her a large pouch. Raboniel took it, and it made a\nsoft clink. Raboniel undid the top, and stared inside. She sat there for a long\nmoment, and when she next spoke, her voice was devoid of rhythms.\n“How? Where did you get this?”\n“I bring a gift,” was all the man said. “To encourage you to meet with\nmy babsk to negotiate terms. I had thought to wait until the current …\nturmoil subsided, but my babsk is determined. We will have a deal for use\nof the Oathgates. And we will pay.”\n“It is … a fine gift,” Raboniel finally said.\n“That is not the gift,” he said. “That is a mere advance on our future\npayments. This is the gift.”\nHe gestured to the side, and the strange creature on his shoulder\nwhistled. The two men that Venli had seen outside entered, carrying\nsomething between them—a large cloth-covered box. It barely fit through\nthe door, and was heavy, judging by the thump it made when they set it\ndown.\nThe lead human whipped the cloth off, revealing a small teenage human\ngirl in a box with bars on the sides. The dirty creature growled as she\nhuddled in the center, shadowed. The man gestured dramatically, then\nbowed and began to walk away.\n“Human?” Raboniel said. “I did not dismiss you. What is this? I need no\nslaves.”\n“This is no slave,” the man said. “But if your master does happen to ever\nlocate Cultivation, suggest that he ask her precisely why she made an\nEdgedancer who is fueled by Lifelight and not Stormlight.” He bowed\nagain—a formal military bow—then withdrew.\nVenli waited, expecting Raboniel to demand he be executed, or at least\nflogged. Instead she started humming to Conceit. She even smiled.\n“I am confused, Ancient One,” Venli said, looking after the man.\n“You needn’t be,” Raboniel said, “for this has nothing to do with you. He\nis dramatic, as I was warned. Hopefully he thinks I was put onto the back\nfoot by his little stunt.

Did he really deliver me a Radiant who is awake\ndespite the tower’s protections?” She peered in at the caged child, who\nstared back defiantly and growled. “Barely seems tame.”\nShe clapped, and several servants entered. “Take this one to a secure\nplace and do not let her go. Be careful. She might be dangerous.” As they\ntook the cage, she turned to Venli and spoke to Craving. “So, was it really\nanother of your people, as the reports say?”\n“Yes,” Venli said. “I know him. His name is Rlain. A listener.”\n“A child of traitors,” Raboniel said.\n“As am I,” Venli said, then paused. She took a deep breath and changed\nher rhythm to Conceit. “I would have him released to my care. I haven’t any\nother kin to speak of. He is precious to me.”\n“Odium specifically made your kin extinct,” Raboniel said. “You are the\nlast. A distinction that you should appreciate, for the way it makes you\nunique.”\n“I do not wish uniqueness,” Venli said. “I wish to keep this malen alive\nand enjoy his company. I have served well in several capacities, to multiple\nFused. I demand this compensation.”\nRaboniel hummed to Derision. Venli panicked, and nearly lost her will—\nbut Timbre, always watching, pulsed to Conceit. A rhythm of Odium, but\nthe best counterpart to Resolve. The rhythm Venli needed to continue to\nexpress now. She did so, humming it, as she didn’t trust herself to speak.\n“Very well,” Raboniel said, picking up her papers to begin reading again.\n“Your Passion does you credit. He is yours. Be certain he doesn’t cause\nproblems, for I will lay them at your charge.”\nVenli hummed to Tribute, then quickly retreated. Inside, Timbre pulsed\nto one of the normal rhythms. She seemed in pain, as if using one of the\nwrong rhythms had been hard for her. But they’d done it. Like she’d freed\nthe Windrunner’s family.\nTimbre pulsed. Freedom. That was to be her next oath, Venli realized. To\nfree those who had been taken unjustly. She almost said a new oath out\nloud, right there, but Timbre pulsed in warning.\nSo she returned to her rooms before going to Rlain. She shut the door to\nher quarters, then whispered the words.\n“I will seek freedom for those in bondage,” she said, then waited.\nNothing happened. Had it worked?\nA distant sensation struck her, a femalen voice, so very far away—but\nthrumming with the pure rhythm of Roshar.\nThese words, it said, are not accepted.\nNot accepted? Venli sank down into a chair. Timbre pulsed to the\nRhythm of Confusion. But in her gemheart, Venli realized she knew the\nreason. She’d just watched a child trapped in a cage be hauled off by\nRaboniel’s servants. It seemed obvious, now that she considered.\nShe couldn’t honestly speak those words. Not when she was concerned\nwith freeing Rlain primarily because she wanted another listener to confide\nin. Not when she was willing to ignore the need of a child locked in a cage."

What is it? Where did it\ncome from?\n—From Rhythm of War, page 13\nFinally, at long last, Navani heard Kaladin’s voice.\nI’m sorry, Brightness, he said, his voice transmitted via the Sibling to\nNavani. I collapsed when I got back last night, and fell asleep. I didn’t\nintentionally keep you waiting.\nUpon arriving at the chamber of scholars in the morning, Navani had\ndiscovered—via the Sibling—that she had slept through what had nearly\nbeen the end of their resistance. She had then waited several interminable\nhours to hear from the Windrunner.\n“Don’t apologize,” Navani whispered, standing in her now customary\nplace, her hands behind her, touching the line of crystal on the wall as she\nsurveyed her working scholars. Guards stood at the door, and the strange\ninsane Fused sat in her place by the far wall, but no one interfered directly\nwith Navani. “You did what you had to—and you did well.”\nI failed, Kaladin said.\n“No,” Navani said softly, but firmly. “Highmarshal, your job is not to\nsave the tower. Your job is to buy me time enough to reverse what has been\ndone. You didn’t fail. You accomplished something incredible, and because\nof it we can still fight.”\nHis reply was long in coming. Thank you, he said, his voice bolstered. I\nneeded to hear those words.\n“They are true,” Navani said. “Given enough time, I’m confident I can\nflush the tower of the enemy’s Light, then instead prime it with the proper\nkind.”\nIt came down to the nature of Stormlight, Voidlight, and the way the\nSibling worked. Navani needed to take a crash course in Light, and figure\nout exactly what had gone wrong.\nBreaking the node seems to have made things worse, Kaladin said.\nHealing takes longer now. A Fused hit me with a knife, and it took a good\nten minutes before my Stormlight fully healed the wound.\n“I doubt that was due to the breaking of the node,” Navani said.\n“Raboniel was able to corrupt the Sibling further before you stopped her.”\nUnderstood. I do feel bad I couldn’t protect the node, but Brightness, I\nthink doing so would be impossible. If the others get discovered, we’ll have\nto destroy them too.\n“I agree,” she said. “Do what you have to in order to give me more time.\nAnything else to report?”\nOh, right! Kaladin said. I couldn’t get to the Oathgates in time. I thought\nI’d be able to easily climb down to the ground floor, but it was a longer\nprocess than I imagined.\n“You didn’t fly?”"

I need to use Adhesion to make\nhandholds. I’ll need to practice more—or find another way up and down—if\nyou want me to try to reach the Oathgates. Regardless, I did snatch some\nspanreeds for you. Full sets, it turns out, twelve of them.\nSyl has been inspecting them, and she thinks she knows the reason they\nwork. Brightness, the spren inside have been corrupted, like Renarin’s\nspren. The rubies work on Voidlight now, as you suspected, and these spren\nmust be the reason.\nNavani let out a long breath. This had been one of her guesses; she\nhadn’t wanted it proven. If she needed to acquire corrupted spren, she was\nunlikely to be able to get any fabrials working without Raboniel knowing.\n“Rest,” she told Kaladin, “and keep your strength up. I will figure out a\npath to reverse what is happening here.”\nWe need to warn Dalinar, Kaladin said. Maybe we could get half of one\nof these spanreeds to him.\n“I don’t know how we’d accomplish that,” Navani said.\nWell, I guess it depends on how far down the tower’s defenses go. It’s\npossible I could leap off a ledge, fall far enough to get outside the\nsuppression, then activate my Lashings. But that would leave you without\naccess to a Radiant. Honestly, I’m loath to suggest it. I don’t know if I could\nleave, considering how things are.\n“Agreed,” Navani said. “For now, it’s more important that I have you\nhere with me. Keep watch for Lift; the Sibling has lost track of her, but she\nwas awake like you are.”\nUnderstood, he said.\n“Are you otherwise well? Do you have food?”\nYeah. I have another of my men helping me. He’s not a Radiant, but he’s\na good man.\n“The mute?” Navani guessed.\nYou know Dabbid?\n“We’ve met. Give him my best.”\nWill do, Brightness. Really though, I don’t think I can rest. I need to\npractice climbing the outside of the tower—but even with practice, I’m\nworried I won’t be fast enough. What if a node is discovered on the fortieth\nfloor? It would take me hours to climb that high.\n“A valid worry,” she said. “I’ll see if I can find a solution. Let’s talk\ntomorrow around this time.”\nUnderstood.\nShe pushed off the wall and strolled through the room. She didn’t want\nto be seen talking to herself; surely the singers knew to watch for signs that\nsomeone was Radiant. She conversed softly with Rushu, explaining her\nplans for the next phase of time-wasting.\nRushu approved, but Navani felt annoyed as she moved on. I need to do\nmore than waste time, Navani thought. I need to work toward our freedom.\nShe’d been formulating her plan.

Now that she had spanreeds, perhaps she\ncould find a way.\nIt was the third step that currently concerned her. In talking to the\nSibling, Navani had confirmed a number of things she’d previously\nsuspected. The tower regulated pressure and heat for those living inside—\nand it had once done a far better job of this, along with performing a host of\nother vital functions.\nMost of that, including the tower’s protections against Fused, had ended\naround the Recreance. The time when the Radiants had abandoned their\noaths—and the time when the ancient singers had been transformed into\nparshmen, their songs and forms stolen. The actions of those ancient\nRadiants had somehow broken the tower—and Raboniel, by filling the\ntower with Voidlight, was starting to repair it in a twisted way.\nNavani felt smothered by it all. She needed to fix a problem using\nmechanisms she didn’t understand—and indeed had learned about only\ndays ago. She paced, massaging her temples. She needed a smaller problem\nshe could work on first, to give her brain some time away from the bigger\nproblem.\nWhat was a smaller problem she could fix? Helping Kaladin move faster\nup and down through the tower? Was there a hidden lift that she could …\nWait.\nA way for one person to quickly get up and down, she thought. Storms.\nShe turned on her heel and walked to the other side of the room,\nsuppressing—as best she could—visible signs of her excitement.\nThe junior engineer Tomor had survived the initial assault. Navani had\nhim recalculating the math on certain schematics. She leaned down beside\nthe young ardent and pointed at his current project, but whispered\nsomething else.\n“That glove you made,” she said. “The one that you wanted to use as a\nsingle-person lift. Where is it?”\n“Brightness?” he asked, surprised. “In the boxes out in the hallway.”\n“I need you to sneak it out,” she whispered, “when you leave today.”\nThe singers let her lesser scholars move more freely than Navani. What\nelse could they do? Force three dozen people to sleep in this room, without\nfacilities? A few of the key scholars—Navani, Rushu, Falilar—were always\nescorted, but the subordinates weren’t paid as much attention.\n“Brightness?” Tomor said. “What if I get caught?”\n“You might be killed,” she whispered. “But it is a risk we must take. A\nRadiant still fights, Tomor, and he needs your device to climb between\nfloors.”\nTomor’s eyes lit up. “My device … Stormblessed needs it?”\n“You know he’s the one?”\n“Everyone’s talking about him,” Tomor said. “I thought it was a fanciful\nrumor.”\n“Bring such rumors to me, fanciful or not,” Navani said. “For now, I\nneed you to sneak that glove out and leave it hidden somewhere it won’t be\ndiscovered, but where Kaladin can reasonably retrieve it.”\n“I’ll try, Brightness,” Tomor said, nervous. “But fabrials don’t work\nanymore.”"

She’d have to coach Kaladin\nthrough installing it all. And the rubies would be smaller than the ones\nTomor had built into the device; would they be able to handle the weight?\nShe’d need to do some calculations, but assuming Tomor had used the\nnewer cages that didn’t stress the rubies as much, it should work.\nShe rose to go speak to some of the others in the same manner and\nposture, to hide the importance of her conversation with Tomor. During the\nsecond such conference, however, she noticed someone at the doorway.\nRaboniel. Navani took a deep breath, composing herself and smothering\nher spike of anxiety. Raboniel would likely be unhappy about what had\nhappened last night. Hopefully she didn’t suspect Navani’s part in it.\nUnfortunately, a guard soon walked into the room, then made straight for\nNavani. Raboniel didn’t fetch an inferior personally. Navani couldn’t banish\nthe anxietyspren that trailed her as she joined the Fused at the doorway.\nRaboniel wore a gown today, though of no cut Navani recognized. Loose\nand formless, it felt like what an Alethi woman would wear to bed. Though\nthe Fused wore it well with her tall figure, it was strangely off-putting to see\nher in something that seemed more regal than martial.\nThe Fused didn’t speak as Navani arrived. Instead she turned and walked\nout of the chamber with a relaxed gait. Navani followed, and they entered\nthe hallway with the murals. Down to the left, the shield surrounding the\ncrystal pillar glowed a soft blue.\n“Your scholars,” Raboniel finally noted, “do not seem to be making\nmuch progress. They were to deliver up to my people fabrials to test.”\n“My scholars are frightened and unnerved, Ancient One,” Navani said.\n“It might take weeks before they feel up to true studies again.”\n“Yes, and longer, if you continue having them repeat work in an effort to\nnot make progress.”\nShe figured that out faster than I anticipated, Navani thought as the two\nstrolled along the hallway toward the shield. Here a common singer soldier\nin warform was working under the direction of several Fused. With a\nShardblade.\nThey’d known the singers had claimed some Blades from the humans\nthey’d fought—but Navani recognized this one. It had belonged to her son.\nElhokar’s Blade, Sunraiser.\nNavani kept her face impassive only with great effort, though the\nanxietyspren faded and an agonyspren arrived instead: an upside-down face\ncarved from stone pressing out from the wall nearby. It betrayed her true\nemotions. That loss ran deep.\nRaboniel glanced at it, but said nothing. Navani kept her eyes forward.\nWatching that horrible Blade in that awful creature’s hand. The warform"

The warform\nheld the weapon at the ready. It held no gemstone at its pommel; it seemed\nthat the warform didn’t have it bonded. Or perhaps the summoning\nmechanism didn’t work in the tower, with the protections in place.\nThe warform attacked the shield—and contrary to Navani’s expectation,\nthe Blade bit into the blue light. The warform carved off a chunk, which\nevaporated to nothing before it hit the floor—and the shield restored itself\njust as quickly. The warform tried again, attempting to dig faster. After a\nfew minutes of watching, Navani could tell the effort was futile. The bubble\nregrew too quickly.\n“Fascinating behavior, wouldn’t you say?” Raboniel asked Navani.\nNavani turned toward Raboniel, steeling herself against the memories\nbrought forth by the sight of the sword. She could cry for her child again\ntonight, as she had done many nights in the past. For now, she would not\nshow these creatures her pain.\n“I’ve never seen anything like that shield, Lady of Wishes,” she said. “I\ncouldn’t begin to understand how it was created.”\n“We could unravel its secrets, if we tried together,” Raboniel said,\n“instead of wasting our time watching one another for hidden motives.”\n“This is true, Ancient One,” Navani said. “But if you want my\ncooperation and goodwill, perhaps you shouldn’t flaunt in front of me the\nBlade taken from the corpse of my son.”\nRaboniel stiffened. She glanced at the warform with the weapon. “I did\nnot know.”\nDidn’t she? Or was this another game?\nRaboniel turned, nodding for Navani to follow as they walked away\nfrom the shield.\n“If I might ask, Ancient One,” Navani said, “why do you give the Blades\nyou capture to common soldiers, and not keep them yourselves?”\nRaboniel hummed to one of her rhythms, but Navani could never tell\nthem apart. Singers seemed to be able to distinguish one rhythm from\nanother after hearing a short word or a couple of seconds of humming.\n“Some Fused do keep the Blades we capture,” Raboniel said. “The ones\nwho enjoy the pain. Now, I fear I must make some changes in how you and\nyour scholars operate. You are distracted, naturally, by preventing them\nfrom giving me too much information. I have unconsciously put you in a\nposition where your obvious talents are wasted by foolish politicking.\n“These are the new arrangements: You will work by yourself at my desk\nin a separate room from the other scholars. Twice a day, you may give them\nwritten directions, which I will personally vet. That should give you more\ntime for worthwhile pursuits, and less for deceit.”\nNavani drew her lips to a line. “I think that is unwise, Ancient One,” she\nsaid. “I am accustomed to working directly with my scholars. They are far\nmore efficient when I am personally directing their efforts.”\n“I find it difficult to imagine them being less efficient than they are\ncurrently, Navani,” Raboniel said. “We will work this way from now on.

It\nis not a matter I care to debate.”\nRaboniel had a long stride, and used it purposely to force Navani to\nhurry to match her. Upon reaching the scholars’ chambers, Raboniel turned\nleft instead of right—entering the room Navani’s scholars had been using as\na library.\nRaboniel’s desk in this chamber had once belonged to Navani. The\nFused gestured, and Navani sat as instructed. This was going to be\ninconvenient—but that was Raboniel’s intent.\nThe Fused went down on one knee, then picked through a box on the\nfloor here. She set something on the desk. A glass globe? Yes, like the one\nthat had been near the first node Navani had activated.\n“When we discovered the node operating the field, this was connected to\nit,” Raboniel said. “Look closely. What do you see?”\nNavani hesitantly picked up the globe, which was heavier than it\nappeared. Though it was made of solid glass, she spotted an unusual\nconstruction inside. Something she hadn’t noticed, or understood, the first\ntime she’d seen one of these. The globe had a pillar rising through the\ncenter.…\n“It’s a reproduction of the crystal pillar room,” Navani said, her eyes\nwidening. “You don’t suppose…”\n“That’s how the field is created,” Raboniel said, tapping the globe with\nan orange carapace fingernail. “It’s a type of Soulcasting. The fabrial is\npersuading the air in a sphere around the pillar to think it is solid glass.\nThat’s why cutting off a piece accomplishes nothing.”\n“That’s incredible,” Navani said. “An application of the Surge I never\nanticipated. It’s not a full transformation, but a half state somehow. Kept in\nperpetual stasis, using this globe as a model to mimic…”\n“There must be similar globes at the other nodes.”\n“Clearly,” Navani said. “After this one was detached, did it make the\nshield seem weaker than before?”\n“Not that we can tell,” Raboniel said. “One node must be enough to\nperpetuate the transformation.”\n“Fascinating…”\nDon’t get taken in, Navani. She wants you to think like a scholar, not like\na queen. She wants you working for her, not against her.\nThat focus was even more difficult to maintain as Raboniel set\nsomething else on the table. A small diamond the size of Navani’s thumb,\nfull of Stormlight. But … was the hue faintly off? Navani held it up,\nfrowning, turning it over in her fingers. She couldn’t tell without a\nStormlight sphere to compare it to, but it did seem this color was faintly\nteal.\n“It’s not Stormlight, is it?” she asked. “Nor Voidlight?”\nRaboniel hummed a rhythm. Then, realizing Navani wouldn’t\nunderstand, said, “No.”\n“The third Light. I knew it. The moment I learned about Voidlight, I\nwondered. Three gods. Three types of Light.”"

Three types of Light.”\n“Ah,” Raboniel said, “but this isn’t the third Light. We call that Lifelight.\nCultivation’s power, distilled. This is something different. Something\nunique. It is the reason I came to this tower. It is a mixing of two. Stormlight\nand Lifelight. Like…”\n“Like the Sibling is a child of both Honor and Cultivation,” Navani said.\nStorms. That was what the Sibling had meant by their Light no longer\nworking. They hadn’t been able to make the tower function any longer\nbecause something had happened to the tower’s Light.\n“It came out in barely a trickle,” Raboniel said. “Something is wrong\nwith the tower, preventing it from flowing.” Her rhythm grew more\nenergetic. “But this is proof. I have long suspected that there must be a way\nto mix and change the various forms of Light. These three energies are the\nmeans by which all Surges work, and yet we know so little about them.\n“What could we do with this power if we truly understood it? This\nTowerlight is proof that Stormlight and Lifelight can mix and create\nsomething new. Can the same be done with Stormlight and Voidlight? Or\nwill that prove impossible, since the two are opposites?”\n“Are they, though?” Navani asked.\n“Yes. Like night and day or oil and water. But perhaps we can find a way\nto put them together. If so, it could be a … model, perhaps, of our peoples.\nA way toward unity instead of strife. Proof that we, although opposites, can\ncoexist.”\nNavani stared at the Towerlight sphere, and she felt compelled to correct\none thing. “Oil and water aren’t opposites.”\n“Of course they are,” Raboniel said. “This is a central tenet of\nphilosophy. They cannot mix, but must remain ever separated.”\n“Just because something doesn’t mix doesn’t make them opposites,”\nNavani said. “Sand and water don’t mix either, and you wouldn’t call them\nopposites. That’s beside the point. Oil and water can mix, if you have an\nemulsifier.”\n“I do not know this word.”\n“It’s a kind of binding agent, Ancient One,” Navani said, standing. If her\nthings were still in here … yes, over at the side of the room, she found a\ncrate holding simple materials for experiments.\nShe made up a vial with some oil and water, adding some stumpweight\nsap extract as a simple emulsifier. She shook the resulting solution and\nhanded it to Raboniel. The Fused took it and held it up, waiting for the oil\nand water to separate. But of course they didn’t.\n“Oil and water mix in nature all the time,” Navani said. “Sow’s milk has\nfat suspended in it, for example.”\n“I … have accepted ancient philosophy as fact for too long, I see,”\nRaboniel said. “I call myself a scholar, but today I feel a fool.”\n“Everyone has holes in their knowledge. There is no shame in ignorance.\nIn any case, oil and water aren’t opposites. I’m not certain what the"

I’m not certain what the\nopposite of water would be, if the word even has meaning when applied to\nan element.”\n“The various forms of Light do have opposites,” Raboniel said. “I am\ncertain of it. Yet I must think on what you’ve shown me.” She reached over\nand tapped the sphere full of Towerlight. “For now, experiment with this\nLight. To keep you focused, I must insist you remain in this room until\nfinished each day, except when accompanied to use the chamber.”\n“Very well,” Navani said. “Though if you want my scholars to actually\ndevelop something for you, this idea of them drawing plans and you testing\nthem is foolish. It won’t work, at least not well. Instead, Ancient One, I\nsuggest you deliver to us gemstones that can power fabrials that work in the\ntower.”\nRaboniel hummed for a moment, regarding the emulsion. “I will send\nsuch gems to your people as proof of my willingness to work together.” She\nturned to go. “If you intend to use ciphers to give hidden instructions to\nyour scholars, kindly make them difficult ones. The spren I will use to\nunravel your true messages do like a challenge. It gives them more variety\nin existence.”\nRaboniel set a guard at the door, but didn’t restrict Navani’s access\nwithin the room. It was otherwise unoccupied: it held only bookshelves,\ncrates, and the occasional sphere lantern. There were no other exits, but\nnear the rear of the room Navani found a vein of crystal hidden among the\nstrata.\n“Are you there?” she asked, touching it.\nYes, the Sibling replied. I am closer to death than ever. Surrounded by\nevils on all sides. Men and singers alike seeking to abuse me.\n“Don’t create a false equivalency,” Navani said. “My kind might not\nunderstand the harm we’ve done to spren, but the enemy certainly knows\nthe harm they cause in corrupting them.”\nRegardless. I will soon die. Only two nodes remain, and the previous one\nwas discovered so rapidly.\n“More proof that you should be helping us, not them,” Navani\nwhispered, peeking through the stacks to see that she hadn’t aroused the\nguard’s attention. “I need to understand more about how these various\nforms of Light work.”\nI don’t think I can explain much, the Sibling said. For me, it all simply\nworked. Like a human child can breathe, so I used to make and use Light.\nAnd then … the tones went away … and the Light left me.\n“All right,” Navani said. “We can talk on that more later. For now, you\nneed to tell me where the other nodes are.”\nNo. Defend them once they are found.\n“Sibling,” Navani said, “if Kaladin Stormblessed can’t protect a node, no\none can. Our goal should be to distract and mislead, to prevent the Fused\nfrom ever finding them. To do this, I’ll need to know where the nodes are.”\nYou talk so well, the Sibling said. So frustratingly well. You humans"

It’s only later, after the pain, that the truth\ncomes out.\n“Hide it if you wish,” Navani said. “But you have to know, after\nwatching Kaladin fight for you, that we are severely outmatched. Our sole\nhope is to prevent the nodes from being located. If I knew where at least\none of them was, I could come up with plots to deflect the enemy’s\nattention.”\nCome up with those plots first, the Sibling said. Then talk to me again.\n“Fine,” Navani said. She slipped a few books off the shelf to hide what\nshe’d been doing, then walked to her seat. There, she began writing down\neverything she knew about light.\nEIGHT YEARS AGO\nEshonai turned the topaz over in her fingers and attuned Tension. A topaz\nshould glow with a calm, deep brown—but this one gave off a wicked\norange light, like the bright color along the back of a sigs cremling warning\nthat it was poisonous.\nLooking closely, Eshonai thought she could make out the spren trapped\nin it. A painspren, frantically moving around. Though … perhaps she\nimagined the frantic part. The spren was mostly formless when inside the\ngemstone, having reverted to the misty Stormlight that created all of their\nkind. Still, it couldn’t be happy in there. How would she feel if she were\nlocked into a room, unable to explore?\n“You learned this from the humans?” Eshonai said.\n“Yes,” Venli said. She sat comfortably between two of the elders in the\nsmall council room, which was furnished with woven mats and painted\nbanners.\nVenli wasn’t one of the Five—the head elders—but she seemed to think\nshe belonged among them. Something had happened to her these last few\nmonths. Where she’d once been self-indulgent, she now radiated egotism\nand confidence. She hummed to Victory as Eshonai passed the gemstone to\none of the elders.\n“Why did you not bring this to us earlier, Venli?” Klade asked. The\nreserved elder took the gemstone next. “The humans have been gone for\nmonths now.”\n“I thought I might be wrong,” Venli said to Confidence. “I decided to see\nif I could trap a spren on my own. Surely you wouldn’t have wanted to be\nbothered by my fancies, should I have been wrong.”\n“I hadn’t heard of this thing they can do,” Klade said to Reconciliation.\n“Do you think you could trap a lifespren? If so, we could better choose\nwhen we adopt mateform. That would be convenient.”\n“Try this stone,” Venli said, taking it, then handing it to Varnali next. “I\nthink it might be the secret to warform.”\n“A dangerous form,” Varnali said. “But useful.”\n“It is not a form of power,” Klade said. “It is within our rights to claim\nit.”\n“The humans make overtures,” Gangnah—foremost among them—said\nto Annoyance, a rhythm used to elicit sympathy for a frustrating situation."

I\nwish we could present to them a stronger face. They have accomplished so\nmuch during our centuries apart, while we remember so little.”\n“Pardon, elders,” Eshonai said to Reconciliation. “But they have\nadvantages we do not. A much larger population, ancient devices to create\nmetals, a land more sheltered from the storms.”\nShe’d recently returned from her latest exploration efforts—which the\nelders now fully supported. She’d sought to circumvent the human trading\npost, then find their home. She’d attuned Disappointment more than once;\nevery place she thought she’d find the humans had been empty. They’d\nfound packs of wild chulls, and even spotted a distant and rare group of\nRyshadium.\nNo humans. Not until she’d returned to their trading post, which had\nbeen transformed into a small fort—built from stone and staffed by soldiers\nand two scribes. The humans had a message for her there. The human king\nwished to “formalize relations” with her people, whom they referred to as\n“Parshendi.”\nShe’d returned with the message to find this: Venli sitting among the\nelders. Venli, so sure of herself. Venli replicating human techniques that\nEshonai—despite spending the most time with them—hadn’t heard them\ndiscuss.\n“Thank you, Eshonai,” Gangnah said to Appreciation. “You have done\nwell on your expedition.” Workform had carapace only along the backs of\nthe hands in small ridges, and Gangnah’s was beginning to whiten at the\nedges. A sign of her age. She turned to the others and continued. “We will\nneed to respond to this offer. The humans expect us to be a nation. Should\nwe form a government like they have?”\n“The other families would never follow us,” Klade said. “They already\nresent how the humans paid more attention to us.”\n“I find the idea of a king distasteful,” added Husal, to Anxiety. “We\nshould not follow them in this.”\nEshonai hummed to Pleading, indicating she wished to speak again.\n“Elders,” she said, “I think I should visit the other families and show them\nmy maps.”\n“What would that accomplish?” Venli asked to Skepticism.\n“If I show them how much there is to the world, they will understand\nthat we are smaller as a people than we thought. They will want to unite.”\nVenli hummed to Amusement. “You think they’d simply join with us?\nBecause they saw maps? Eshonai, you are a delight.”\n“We will consider your proposal,” Gangnah said, then hummed to\nAppreciation—as a dismissal.\nEshonai retreated out into the sunlight as the elders asked Venli\nadditional questions about creating gemstones with trapped spren. Eshonai\nattuned Annoyance. Then, by force, she changed her rhythm to Peace\ninstead. She always felt anxious after an extended trip. She wasn’t annoyed\nwith her sister, just the general situation."

She wasn’t annoyed\nwith her sister, just the general situation.\nShe let herself rove outward to the cracked wall that surrounded the city.\nShe liked this place; it was old, and old things seemed … thoughtful to her.\nShe walked along the base of the once-wall, passing listeners tending\nchulls, carrying in grain from the fields, hauling water. Many raised a hand\nor called to a rhythm when they saw her. She was famous now,\nunfortunately. She had to stop and chat with several listeners who wanted to\nask about her expedition.\nShe suffered the attention with patience. Eshonai had spent years trying\nto inspire this kind of interest about the outside world. She wouldn’t throw\naway this goodwill now.\nShe managed to extract herself, and climbed up a watchpost along the\nwall. From it, she could see listeners from other families moving about on\nthe Plains, or driving their hogs past the perimeter of the city.\nThere are more of them about than usual, she thought. One of the other\nfamilies might be preparing an assault on the city. Would they be so bold?\nSo soon after the humans had come and changed the world?\nYes, they would be. Eshonai’s own family had been that bold, after all.\nThe others might assume Eshonai’s people were getting secrets, or special\ntrade goods, from the humans. They would want to put themselves into a\nposition to receive the humans’ blessings instead.\nEshonai needed to go to them and explain. Why fight, when there was so\nmuch more out there to experience? Why squabble over these old, broken-\ndown cities? They could be building new ones as the humans did. She\nattuned Determination.\nThen she attuned right back to Anxiety as she saw a figure walking\ndistractedly along the base of the wall. Eshonai’s mother wore a loose\nbrown robe, dull against the femalen’s gorgeous red and black skin patterns.\nEshonai climbed down and ran over. “Mother?”\n“Ah,” her mother said to Anxiety. “I know you. Can you perhaps help\nme? I seem to find myself in an odd situation.”\nEshonai took her mother by the arm. “Mother.”\n“Yes. Yes, I’m your mother. You are Eshonai.” The femalen looked\naround, then she leaned in. “Can you tell me how I arrived here, Eshonai? I\ndon’t seem to remember.”\n“You were going to wait for me to get home,” Eshonai said. “With\nfood.”\n“I was? Why didn’t I do that, then?”\n“You must have lost track of time,” Eshonai said, to Consolation. “Let’s\nget you home.”\nJaxlim hummed to Determination and refused to be budged, seeming to\nbecome more conscious, more herself by the second. “Eshonai,” she said,\n“we have to confront this. This is not simply me feeling tired. This is\nsomething worse.”\n“Maybe not, Mother,” Eshonai said. “Maybe it…”\nHer mother hummed to the Rhythm of the Lost. Eshonai trailed off."

Eshonai trailed off.\n“I must make certain your sister knows the songs,” Jaxlim said. “We\nmay have reached the riddens of my life, Eshonai.”\n“Please, come and rest,” Eshonai said to Peace.\n“Rest is for those with time to spare, dear,” her mother said, but let\nherself be led in the direction of their home. She pulled her robe tight. “I\ncan face this. Our ancestors took weakness upon themselves to bring our\npeople into existence. They faced frailty of body and mind. I can face this\nwith grace. I must.”\nEshonai settled her at home with something to eat. Then, Eshonai\nconsidered getting out her new maps to show her mother, but hesitated.\nJaxlim never did like hearing about Eshonai’s travels. It was best not to\nupset her.\nWhy did it have to happen like this? Eshonai finally got what she wanted\nout of life. But progress, change, couldn’t happen without the passing of\nstorms and the movement of years. Each day forward meant another day of\nregression for her mother.\nTime. It was a sadistic master. It made adults of children—then gleefully,\nrelentlessly, stole away everything it had given.\nThey were still eating when Venli returned. She always had a hidden\nsmile these days, as if attuning Amusement in secret. She set her gemstone\n—the one with the spren—on the table.\n“They’re going to try it,” Venli said. “They are taking volunteers now.\nI’m to provide a handful of these gemstones.”\n“How did you learn to cut them as humans do?” Eshonai asked.\n“It wasn’t hard,” Venli said. “It merely took a little practice.”\nTheir mother stared at the gemstone. She wiped her hands with a cloth,\nthen picked it up. “Venli. I need you to return to practice. I don’t know how\nmuch longer I will be suited to being our keeper of songs.”\n“Because your mind is giving out,” Venli said. “Mother, why do you\nthink I’ve been working so hard to find these new forms? This can help.”\nEshonai attuned Surprise, glancing at their mother.\n“Help?” Jaxlim said.\n“Each form has a different way of thinking,” Venli said. “That is\npreserved in the songs. And some were stronger, more resilient to diseases,\nboth physical and mental. So if you were to change to this new form…”\nHer mother attuned Consideration.\n“I … hadn’t realized this,” Eshonai said. “Mother, you must volunteer!\nThis could be our answer!”\n“I’ve been trying to get the elders to see,” Venli said. “They want young\nlisteners to try the change first.”\n“They will listen to me,” Jaxlim said to Determination. “It is, after all,\nmy job to speak for them to hear. I will try this form, Venli. And if you have\ntruly accomplished this goal of yours … well, I once thought that being our\nnew keeper of songs would be your highest calling. I hadn’t considered that"

More violent?\nYou’re imagining things, she told herself. Don’t let jealousy consume\nyou, Eshonai.

Of Rock frozen in the Peaks, of Lopen slain on a distant\nbattlefield, of Teft dying alone, shriveled to bones, his eyes glazed over\nfrom repeated use of firemoss.\n“No,” Kaladin screamed. “No!”\n“Kaladin!” Syl said. She zipped around his head, filling his eyes with\nstreaks of blue-white light. “You’re awake. You’re all right. Kaladin?”\nHe breathed in and out, taking deep lungfuls. The nightmares felt so real,\nand they lingered. Like the scent of blood on your clothing after a battle.\nHe forced himself to his feet, and was surprised to find a small bag of\nglowing gemstones on the room’s stone ledge.\n“From Dabbid,” Syl said. “He left them a little earlier, along with some\nbroth, then grabbed the jug to go get water.”\n“How did he…” Maybe he’d gotten them from the ardent at the\nmonastery? Or maybe he’d quietly taken them from somewhere else.\nDabbid could move around the tower in ways that Kaladin couldn’t—\npeople always looked at Kaladin, remembered him. It was the height, he\nguessed. Or maybe it was the way he held himself. He’d never learned to\nkeep his head down properly, even when he’d been a slave.\nKaladin shook his head, then did his morning routine: stretches,\nexercises, then washing as best he could with a cloth and some water. After\nthat he saw to Teft, washing him, then shifting the way the man was lying to\nhelp prevent bedsores. That all done, Kaladin knelt beside Teft’s bench with\nthe syringe and broth, trying to find solace from his own mind through the\ncalming act of feeding his friend.\nSyl settled onto the stone bench beside Teft as Kaladin worked, wearing\nher girlish dress, sitting with her knees pulled up against her chest and her\narms wrapped around them. Neither of them spoke for a long while as\nKaladin worked.\n“I wish he were awake,” Syl finally whispered. “There’s something\nhappy about the way Teft is angry.”\nKaladin nodded.\n“I went to Dalinar,” she said, “before he left. I asked him if he could\nmake me feel like humans do. Sad sometimes.”\n“What?” Kaladin asked. “Why in the Almighty’s tenth name would you\ndo something like that?”\n“I wanted to feel what you feel,” she said.\n“Nobody should have to feel like I do.”"

I can make decisions for myself.” She\nstared sightlessly past Teft and Kaladin. “It was in talking to him that I\nstarted remembering my old knight, like I told you. I think Dalinar did\nsomething. I wanted him to Connect me to you. He refused. But I think he\nsomehow Connected me to who I was. Made me able to remember, and hurt\nagain…”\nKaladin felt helpless. He had never been able to struggle through his own\nfeelings of darkness. How did he help someone else?\nTien could do it, he thought. Tien would know what to say.\nStorms, he missed his brother. Even after all these years.\n“I think,” Syl said, “that we spren have a problem. We think we don’t\nchange. You’ll hear us say it sometimes. ‘Men change. Singers change.\nSpren don’t.’ We think that because pieces of us are eternal, we are as well.\nBut pieces of humans are eternal too.\n“If we can choose, we can change. If we can’t change, then choice\nmeans nothing. I’m glad I feel this way, to remind me that I haven’t always\nfelt the same. Been the same. It means that in coming here to find another\nKnight Radiant, I was deciding. Not simply doing what I was made to, but\ndoing what I wanted to.”\nKaladin cocked his head, the syringe full of broth halfway to Teft’s lips.\n“When I’m at my worst, I feel like I can’t change. Like I’ve never changed.\nThat I’ve always felt this way, and always will.”\n“When you get like that,” Syl said, “let me know, all right? Maybe it will\nhelp to talk to me about it.”\n“Yeah. All right.”\n“And Kal?” she said. “Do the same for me.”\nHe nodded, and the two of them fell silent. Kaladin wanted to say more.\nHe should have said more. But he felt so tired. Exhaustionspren swirled in\nthe room, though he’d slept half the day.\nHe could see the signs. Or rather, he couldn’t ignore them anymore. He\nwas deeply within the grip of battle shock, and the tower being under\noccupation didn’t magically fix that. It made things worse. More fighting.\nMore time alone. More people depending on him.\nKilling, loneliness, and stress. An unholy triumvirate, working together\nwith spears and knives to corner him. Then they just. Kept. Stabbing.\n“Kaladin?” Syl said.\nHe realized he’d been sitting there, not moving, for … how long?\nStorms. He quickly refilled the syringe and lifted it to Teft’s lips. The man\nwas stirring again, muttering, and Kaladin could almost make out what he\nwas saying. Something about his parents?\nSoon the door opened and Dabbid entered. He gave Kaladin a quick\nsalute, then hurried over to the bench near Teft and put something down on\nthe stone. He gestured urgently."

He gestured urgently.\n“What’s this?” Kaladin asked, then unwrapped the cloth to reveal some\nkind of fabrial. It looked like a leather bracer, the type Dalinar and Navani\nwore to tell the time. Only the construction was different. It had long leather\nstraps on it, and a metal portion—like a handle—that came up and went\nacross the palm. Turning it over, Kaladin found ten rubies in the bracer\nportion, though they were dun.\n“What on Roshar?” Kaladin asked.\nDabbid shrugged.\n“The Sibling led you to this, I assume?”\nDabbid nodded.\n“Navani must have sent it,” Kaladin said. “Syl, what time is it?”\n“About a half hour before your meeting with the queen,” she said,\nlooking upward toward the sky, occluded behind many feet of stone.\n“Next highstorm?” Kaladin asked.\n“Not sure, a few days at least. Why?”\n“We’ll want to restore the dun gemstones I used in that fight with the\nPursuer. Thanks for the new ones, by the way, Dabbid. We’ll need to find a\nway to hide the others outside to recharge though.”\nDabbid patted his chest. He’d do it.\n“You seem to be doing better these days,” Kaladin said, settling down to\nfinish feeding Teft.\nDabbid shrugged.\n“Want to share your secret?” Kaladin asked.\nDabbid sat on the floor and put his hands in his lap. So Kaladin went\nback to his work. It proved surprisingly tiring—as he had to forcibly keep\nhis attention from wandering to his nightmares. He was glad when, upon\nfinishing, Syl told him the time had arrived for his check-in with Navani.\nHe walked to the side of the room, pressed his hand against the crystal\nvein, and waited for her to speak in his mind.\nHighmarshal? she said a few minutes later.\n“Here,” he replied. “But, since I was on my way to becoming a full-time\nsurgeon, I’m not sure I still have that rank.”\nI’m reinstating you. I managed to have one of my engineers sneak out a\nfabrial you might find useful. The Sibling should be able to guide you to it.\n“I’ve got it already,” Kaladin said. “Though I have no idea what it’s\nsupposed to do.”\nIt’s a personal lift, meant to levitate you up and down long distances. To\nhelp you travel the height of the tower.\n“Interesting,” he said, glancing at the device laid out on the stone bench.\n“Though, I’m not one for technology, Brightness. Pardon, but I barely know\nhow to turn on a heating fabrial.”\nYou’ll need to learn quickly then, Navani said. As you’ll need to replace\nthe rubies in the fabrial with the Voidspren ones from the spanreeds you\nstole. We’ll need all twelve pairs.

        "text": "stole. We’ll need all twelve pairs. Do you see a map in with the device?\n“Just a moment,” he said, digging in the sack and pulling out a small\nfolded map. It led to a place on the twentieth floor, judging by the glyphs.\n“I’ve got it. I should be able to reach this place. The enemy isn’t guarding\nthe upper floors.”\nExcellent. There are weights in a shaft up there where you’ll need to\ninstall the other halves of those rubies. A mechanism on the fabrial bracer\nwill drop one of those weights, and that force will transfer through the\nbracer. You’ll be pulled in whatever direction you’ve pointed the device.\n“By my arm?” Kaladin asked. “That doesn’t sound comfortable.”\nIt isn’t. My engineer has been trying to fix that. There is a strap that\nwinds around your arm and braces against your shoulder, which he thinks\nmight help.\n“All right…” he said. It was something to do, at least.\nBut fabrials? He’d always considered them toys for rich people. Though\nhe supposed that was becoming less and less the case. Breeding projects\nwere creating livestock with larger and larger ruby gemhearts, and fabrial\ncreation methods were spreading. It seemed every third room had a heating\nfabrial these days, and spanreeds were cheap enough that even the enlisted\nmen could afford to pay to send messages via one.\nNavani coached him through replacing the rubies. Fortunately, the case\nof spanreeds he’d stolen included a few small tools for undoing casings. It\nwasn’t any more difficult than replacing the buckles on a leather jerkin.\nOnce it was done, he and Syl ventured out, sneaking up nine floors. He\ndidn’t use any Stormlight; he didn’t have enough to waste. Besides, it felt\ngood to work his body.\nOn the twentieth floor, the garnet light led him to the location the map\nhad described. Inside he found the weights and the shaft, and Navani\nwalked him through installing the matching rubies. He began to grasp how\nthe device worked. The big weights were more than heavy enough to lift a\nman. Five of the rubies in his fabrial were connected to these weights,\nbinding them together.\nThe other seven rubies were used to activate and control the weights.\nThe intricate system of pulleys and mechanisms was far more complex than\nhe could understand, but essentially it allowed him to switch to a different\nweight when one had dropped all the way. He could also slow the weight’s\nfall or stop it completely, modulating how quickly he was being pulled.\nEach weight should be able to pull you hundreds of feet before running\nout, Navani said via a garnet vein on the wall. These shafts plunge all the\nway down to the aquifers at the base of the mountain. That means you\nshould be able to soar all the way up from the ground floor to the top of the\ntower using one weight.\nThe bad news is that once all five weights have fallen, the device will be\nuseless until you rewind them. There is a winch in the corner; it’s an\narduous process, I’m afraid.\n“That’s annoying,” Kaladin said.\nYes, it is mildly inconvenient that we have to wind a crank to experience\nthe wonder of making a human being safely levitate hundreds of feet in the\nair."

        "text": "“That’s annoying,” Kaladin said.\nYes, it is mildly inconvenient that we have to wind a crank to experience\nthe wonder of making a human being safely levitate hundreds of feet in the\nair.\n“Pardon, Brightness, but I can usually do it with far less trouble.”\nWhich is meaningless right now, isn’t it?\n“I suppose it is,” he said. He looked at the fabrial, now attached to his\nleft arm, with the straps winding around all the way to his shoulder. It was a\nlittle constrictive, but otherwise fit quite well. “So, I point it where I want to\ngo, activate it, and I’ll get pulled that way?”\nYes. But we made the device so that it won’t move if you let go—it was\ntoo dangerous otherwise. See the pressure spring across your palm? Ease\noff that, and the brake on the line will activate. Do you see?\n“Yes,” Kaladin said, making a fist around the bar. It had a separate metal\nportion wrapped around it on one side, with a spring underneath. So the\nharder he squeezed, the faster the device would pull him. If he let go\ncompletely, he’d stop in place.\nThere are two steps to the fabrial’s use. First, you have to turn the device\non—conjoining the rubies. The switch you can move with your thumb?\nThat’s for this purpose. Once you flip it, your arm will be locked into its\ncurrent orientation, and won’t be able to move the bracer in any direction\nexcept forward.\nThe second step is to start dropping a weight. If a weight falls all the\nway, swap to the next one using the dial on the back of your wrist. You see\nit?\n“I do,” he said.\nOnce you stop, you’ll remain hanging until you disengage the device.\nBut so long as you have another weight that hasn’t run out, you can turn the\ndial to that one, then continue moving upward. Or if you’re bold enough,\nyou can disengage the device and fall for a second while you point it\nanother direction, then engage it again and set it to pull you that way\ninstead.\n“That sounds dangerous,” Kaladin said. “If I’m up high in the air, and\nneed to get over to a balcony or something, I have to drop into free fall for a\nbit to reset the direction of the device so it can pull me laterally instead of\nup and down?”\nYes, unfortunately. The engineer who created this has grand and lofty\nideas—but not much practical sense. But it’s better than nothing,\nHighmarshal. And it’s the best I can do for you right now.\nKaladin took a deep breath. “Understood. I’m sorry if I sounded\nungrateful, Brightness. It’s been a rough few days. I’m glad for the help. I’ll\nfamiliarize myself with it.”\nExcellent. You shouldn’t have to worry about the Voidlight in the\ngemstones running out through practice—conjoined rubies don’t use much\nenergy to maintain their connection. But they will run out naturally, over\ntime. We’ll have to figure out what to do about that when it happens.\nFor now, I’m hoping the Sibling will soon trust me enough to tell me\nwhere to find the remaining nodes.

Once I have that information, I can\ndevise a plan to protect them, perhaps by distracting the enemy’s search\ntoward a different region of the tower. It’s vital that you keep that shield in\nplace as long as possible, to give me time to figure out what is wrong with\nthe Light in the tower and its defenses.\n“Any movement there?” Kaladin asked.\nNo, but I’m currently focused on filling holes in my understanding. Once\nI have the proper fundamentals on Stormlight and Voidlight, I hope I’ll\nmake more rapid progress.\n“Understood,” Kaladin said. “I’ll contact you again in a few hours, if\nyou can make time, to discuss my experience with this device.”\nThank you.\nHe stepped away from the wall. Syl stood in the air beside him,\ninspecting the fabrial.\n“So?” Kaladin asked her. “What do you think?”\n“I think you’re going to look extremely silly using it. I can’t wait.”\nHe walked out to a nearby hallway. Up here on the twentieth floor, he\nshould be safe practicing in the open—assuming he stayed away from the\natrium. He walked the length of the hallway, setting out amethysts to light\nthe way. Then he stood at one end, looking down the line of lights. The\nfabrial left his fingers free, but that bar in the center of his hand would\ninterfere with fighting. He’d have to one-hand his spear, as if he were\nfighting with a shield.\n“We’re going to try it here?” Syl asked, darting over to him. “Isn’t it for\ngetting up and down?”\n“Brightness Navani told me it pulls you in whatever direction you point\nit,” he said. “New Windrunners always want to go up with their Lashings—\nbut the more experience you have, the more you realize you can accomplish\nfar more if you think in three dimensions.”\nHe pointed his left hand down the hallway and opened his palm. Then,\nthinking it wise, he took in a little Stormlight. Finally, he used his thumb to\nflip the little lever and engage the mechanism. Nothing happened.\nSo far so good, he thought, trying to move his hand right or left. It\nresisted, held in place. Good.\nHe eased his hand into a fist, squeezing the bar across his palm, and was\nimmediately pulled through the corridor. He skidded on his heels, and\nwasn’t able to slow himself at all. Those weights really were heavy.\nKaladin opened his hand, stopping in place. Because the device was still\nactive, when he lifted his feet off the ground, he stayed in the air. However,\nthis also put an incredible amount of stress on his arm, especially the elbow.\nYes, the device in its current state might be too dangerous for anyone\nwithout Stormlight to use. He put his feet back down and tapped the toggle\nwith his thumb to disengage the device, and his arm immediately dropped\nfree. The weight—when he went to check on it—was hanging a little\nfurther down into the shaft. As soon as he’d disengaged the device, the\nbrakes had locked, holding the weight in place.\nHe went out into the hallway, engaged the device, and gripped the bar"

As soon as he’d disengaged the device, the\nbrakes had locked, holding the weight in place.\nHe went out into the hallway, engaged the device, and gripped the bar\nfirmly. That sent him soaring forward. He tucked up his feet, straining—\nwith effort—to keep himself otherwise upright. In that moment, difficult\nthough the exercise was, he felt something come alive in him again. The\nwind in his hair. His body soaring, claiming the sky, albeit in an imperfect\nway. He found the experience familiar. Even intuitive.\nThat lasted right up until the moment when he noticed the quickly\napproaching far wall. He reacted a little too slowly, first trying to Lash\nhimself backward by instinct. He slammed into the wall hand-first and felt\nhis knuckles crunch. The device continued trying to go forward, crushing\nhis mangled hand further, forcing it to keep the bar compressed. The device\nheld him affixed to the wall until he managed to reach over with his other\nhand and flip the thumb switch, releasing the mechanism and setting him\nfree.\nHe gasped in pain, sucking the Stormlight from a nearby amethyst on the\nfloor. The healing happened slowly, as it had the other day. The pain was\nacute; he gritted his teeth while he waited—and split skin, broken by bones,\nmade him bleed on the device, staining its leather.\nSyl scowled at the painspren crawling around the floor. “Um, I was\nwrong. That wasn’t particularly funny.”\n“Sorry,” Kaladin said, eyes watering from the pain.\n“What happened?”\n“Bad instincts,” he said. “Not the device’s fault. I just forgot what I was\ndoing.”\nHe sat to wait, and he heard the joints popping and the bones grinding as\nthe Stormlight reknit him. He’d come to rely on his near-instantaneous\nhealing; this was agony.\nIt was a good five minutes before he shook out his healed hand and\nstretched it, good as new, other than some lingering phantom pain. “Right,”\nhe said. “I’ll want to be more careful. I’m playing with some incredible\nforces in those weights.”\n“At least you didn’t break the fabrial,” Syl said. “Strange as it is to say,\nit’s a lot easier to get you a new hand than a new device.”\n“True,” he said, standing. He launched himself down the hallway back\nthe way he had come, this time maintaining a careful speed, and slowed\nhimself as he neared the other end.\nOver the next half hour or so he crashed a few more times, though never\nas spectacularly as that first one. He needed to be very careful to point his\nhand straight down the center of the hallway, or else he’d drift to the side\nand end up scraping across the wall. He also had to be acutely aware of the\ndevice, as it was remarkably easy to flip the activation switch accidentally\nby brushing his hand against something.\nHe kept practicing, and was able to go back and forth for quite a while\nbefore the device stopped working. He lurched to a halt midflight, hanging\nin the center of the hallway.\nHe rested his feet on the ground and deactivated the device. The weight\nhe’d been using had hit the bottom. That had lasted him quite a long time—"

That had lasted him quite a long time—\nthough much of that time had been resetting and moving around. In actual\nfree fall, he probably wouldn’t have longer than a few minutes of flight. But\nif he controlled the weight, using it in short bursts, he could make good use\nof those minutes.\nHe wouldn’t be soaring about fighting Heavenly Ones in swooping\nbattles with this. But he could get an extra burst of speed in a fight, and\nmaybe move in an unexpected direction. Navani intended him to use it as a\nlift. It would work for that, certainly. And he intended to practice going up\nand down outside once it was dark.\nBut Kaladin also saw martial applications. And all in all, the device\nworked better than he’d expected. So he walked to the end of the hallway to\nset up again.\n“More?” Syl asked.\n“You have an appointment or something?” Kaladin asked.\n“Just a little bored.”\n“I could crash into another wall, if you like.”\n“Only if you promise to be amusing when you do it.”\n“What? You want me to break more fingers?”\n“No.” She zipped around him as a ribbon of light. “Breaking your hands\nisn’t very funny. Try a different body part. A funny one.”\n“I’m going to stop trying to imagine how to manage that,” he said, “and\nget back to work.”\n“And how long are we going to be doing this decidedly unfunny\ncrashing?”\n“Until we don’t crash, obviously,” Kaladin said. “I had months to train\nwith my Lashings, and longer to prepare for my first fight as a spearman.\nJudging by how quickly the Fused found the first node, I suspect I’ll have\nonly a few days to train on this device before I need to use it.”\nWhen the time came—assuming Navani or the Sibling could give him\nwarning—he wanted to be ready. He knew of at least one way to quiet the\nnightmares, the mounting pressure, and the mental exhaustion. He couldn’t\ndo much about his situation, or the cracks that were ever widening inside\nhim.\nBut he could stay busy, and in so doing, not let those cracks define him.\nThe sand originated offworld. It is only one of such amazing wonders\nthat come from other lands—I have recently obtained a chain from the\nlands of the dead, said to be able to anchor a person through\nCognitive anomalies.

Until you stand in those lines, holding\nyour sword and facing down the enemy force, you’ll never understand. No\nbook could prepare you, Jasnah. So yes, I think you should go.\nA thousand quotes from noted scholars leaped to her mind. Accounts of\nwhat it was like to be in war. She’d read hundreds; some so detailed, she’d\nbeen able to smell the blood in the air. Yet they all fled like shadows before\nsunlight as she reached the front of the coalition armies and looked out at\nthe enemy.\nTheir numbers seemed endless. A fungus on the land ahead, black and\nwhite and red, weapons glistening in the sun.\nReports said there were about forty thousand singers here. That was a\nnumber she could comprehend, could analyze. But her eyes didn’t see forty\nthousand, they saw endless ranks. Numbers on a page became meaningless.\nShe hadn’t come to fight forty thousand. She’d come to fight a tide.\nOn paper, this place was the Drunmu Basin in Emul. It was a vast ocean\nof shivering grass and towering pile-vines. In meetings, the Mink had\ninsisted that a battle here favored the coalition side. If they let the enemy\nretreat to cities and forts, they could hunker down and make for tough shells\nto crack. Instead he’d pushed them to a place where they’d feel confident\nstanding in a full battle, as they had a slight advantage in high ground and\nthe sun to their backs. Here they would stand, and the Mink could leverage\nthe coalition’s greater numbers and skill to victory.\nSo logically she understood that this was a battle that her forces wanted.\nIn person, she felt overwhelmed by the distance to the enemy—distance\nshe, with the others, would have to cross under a barrage of enemy arrows\nand spears. It was hard not to feel small, even in her Plate.\nThe horns sounded, ordering the advance, and she noted two\nEdgedancers keeping close to her—likely at her uncle’s request. Though\nshe’d always imagined battles beginning with a grand charge, her force\nmoved mechanically. Shields up, in formation, at a solid march that the\nveteran troops maintained as arrows started falling. Running would break\nthe lines, not to mention leave the soldiers winded when they arrived.\nShe winced as the first arrows struck. They fell with an arrhythmic series\nof snaps, metal on wood, like hail. One bounced off her shoulder and\nanother skimmed her helm. Fortunately, the arrows were soon interrupted as\nAzish light cavalry executed a raid on the enemy archers. She heard the\nhooves, saw the Windrunners soaring overhead, guarding the horsemen\nfrom the air. The enemy kept misjudging cavalry, which hadn’t been\navailable in significant numbers thousands of years ago.\nThrough it all, the Alethi troops kept marching forward, shields up. It\ntook an excruciatingly long time, but since Jasnah’s side was the aggressor,\nthe enemy had no impetus to meet them. They maintained their position\natop their shallow incline. She could see why the enemy would think it wise\nto stand here, as Jasnah’s forces had to make their assault up this hillside.\nThe enemy resolved into a block of figures in carapace and steel armor,"

        "text": "to stand here, as Jasnah’s forces had to make their assault up this hillside.\nThe enemy resolved into a block of figures in carapace and steel armor,\nholding large shields and sprouting with pikes several lines deep. These\nsingers did not fight like the Parshendi on the Shattered Plains; these were\ndrilled troops, and the Fused had adapted quickly to modern warfare. They\nhad a slight myopia when it came to cavalry, true, but they knew far better\nhow to most effectively employ their Surgebinders.\nBy the time Jasnah’s block of troops was in position, she felt exhausted\nfrom staying at a heightened level of alert during the march. She stopped\nwith the others, grass retreating in a wave before her—as if it could sense\nthe coming fight like it sensed a storm. She had ordered her Plate to\nintentionally dull its light, so it looked like that of an ordinary Shardbearer.\nThe enemy would still single her out, but not recognize her as the queen.\nShe would be safer this way.\nThe horns rang out. Jasnah started up the last part of the incline at not\nquite a run. It was too shallow to be called a hill, and if she’d been out on a\nwalk, she wouldn’t have remarked much on the slope. But now she felt it\nwith each step. Her Plate urged her to move, as did the Stormlight she\nbreathed in, but if she ran too far ahead of her block of troops she could be\nsurrounded. The enemy would have Fused and Regals hiding among their\nranks, waiting to ambush her. Other than the Heavenly Ones, few Fused\nchose to meet Shardbearers in direct combat.\nJasnah summoned Ivory as a Blade, the weapon falling into her waiting\ngauntlets. Ready? she asked.\nYes.\nShe charged the last few feet to the pike block and swept with Ivory. Her\njob was to break their lines; a full Shardbearer could cause entire\nformations to crumble around her.\nTo their credit, this singer formation did not break. It buckled backward,\npikes scraping her armor as she tried to get in close and attack, but it held.\nHer honor guard—along with those two Edgedancers—came in behind to\nkeep her from being surrounded. Nearby, another block of five thousand\nsoldiers hit the enemy. Grunts and crunches sounded in the air.\nHolding her Blade in a two-handed grip, Jasnah swept back and forth,\ncutting free pike heads and trying to strike inward at the enemy. They\nmoved with unexpected flexibility, singers dancing away, staying out of the\nrange of her sword.\nThis is less effective, Ivory said to her. Our other powers are. Use them?\nNo. I want to know the real feeling of war, Jasnah thought. Or as close to\nit as I can allow myself, in Plate with Blade.\nEver the scholar, Ivory said with a long-suffering tone as Jasnah\nshouldered past some pikes—which were practically useless against her—\nand managed to ram her Blade into the chest of a singer. The singer’s eyes\nburned as she fell, and Jasnah ripped the sword around, causing others to\ncurse and shy back.\nIt wasn’t only academics that drove her.

She\nneeded to feel what they felt. And yes, she could use her powers.\nSoulcasting had proven useful to her in fights before, but without Dalinar,\nshe had limited Stormlight and wanted to conserve it.\nShe would escape to Shadesmar if things went poorly. She wasn’t\nfoolish. Yet this knowledge nagged at her as she swept through the\nformation, keeping the enemy busy. She couldn’t ever truly feel what it was\nlike to be an unfortunate spearman on the front lines.\nShe could hear them shouting as the two forces crashed together. The\nformations seemed so deliberate, and on the grand scale they were careful\nthings. Positioned with a kind of terrible momentum that forced the men at\nthe front to fight. So while the block remained firm, the front lines ground\nagainst one another, screaming like steel being bent.\nThat was a feeling Jasnah would never experience. The weight of a block\nof soldiers on each side crushing you between them—with no possible\nescape. Still, she wanted to know what she could. She swept around,\nforcing more singers back—but others began prodding her with pikes and\nspears, shoving her to the side, threatening to trip her.\nShe’d underestimated the effectiveness of those pikes; yes, they were\nuseless for breaking her armor, but they could maneuver her like a chull\nbeing prodded with poles. She stumbled and felt her first true spike of fear.\nControl it. Instead of trying to right herself, she turned her shoulder\ntoward the enemy, turning her off-balance stumble into a rush, crashing out\nof the enemy ranks near her soldiers. She hadn’t killed many of the enemy,\nbut she didn’t need to. Their ranks rippled and bowed from her efforts, and\nher soldiers exploited this. On either side of her, they matched pikes and\nspears with the enemy—the front row of her soldiers rotating to the back\nline of the block every ten minutes under the careful orders of the rank\ncommander.\nEngulfed by the sounds of war, Jasnah turned toward the enemy, and her\nhonor guard formed up behind her. Then—sweat trickling down her brow—\nshe charged in again. This time when the enemy parted around her, they\nrevealed a hulking creature hidden in their ranks. A Fused with carapace\nthat grew into large axelike protrusions around his hands: one of the\nMagnified Ones. Fused with the Surge of Progression, which let them grow\ncarapace with extreme precision and speed.\nThe regular soldiers on both sides kept their distance, forming a pocket\nof space around the two. Jasnah resisted using her powers. With her Shards,\nshe should be evenly matched against this creature—and her powers would\nquickly reveal who she was, as there were no other Surgebinders in the\ncoalition army who had their own Plate.\nThere is another reason you fight, Ivory said, challenging her.\nYes, there was. Instead of confronting that, Jasnah threw herself into the\nduel, Stormlight raging in her veins. She sheared free one of the Fused’s\naxe-hands, but the other slammed into her and sent her sprawling. She"

She\nshook her head, resummoning her Blade and sweeping upward as the Fused\nrammed its hand down. She cut off the axe, but the trunk of the creature’s\narm slammed against her chest. Carapace grew over her like the roots of a\ntree, pinning her to the ground.\nThe Fused stepped away, snapping the carapace free at its elbow, leaving\nher immobilized. Then he turned as her honor guard distracted him.\nAh, we’re getting so much wonderful experience, Ivory said to her.\nDelightful.\nOther soldiers came in at Jasnah and began ramming thin pikes through\nher faceplate. One pierced her eye, making her scream. Stormlight healed\nher though, and her helm sealed the slit to prevent further attacks. With\nStormlight, she didn’t need it to breathe anyway. But this, like her quick\nsummoning of her Blade, was a concession. It risked revealing what she\nwas.\nShe ripped her hand free of the constricting carapace, then used Ivory as\na dagger to cut her way out. She rolled free, tripping singers and kicking at\ntheir legs to send them sprawling. But as she came out of her roll, that\nstorming Fused lunged in, slamming two axe-hands at her head, cracking\nthe Plate. The helm howled in pain and annoyance, then lapped up her\nStormlight to repair itself.\nSuch fun is, Ivory said. But of course, Jasnah mustn’t use her powers.\nShe wants to play soldier.\nJasnah growled, going to one knee and punching her fist at the Fused’s\nknee—but it overgrew with carapace right before she connected. Her punch\ndidn’t even move the creature. Ivory became a short sword in her hand as\nshe slashed at the Fused—but this exposed her to another hit in the helm,\nwhich laid her flat. She groaned, putting one hand against the rock.\nSteady stone, a part of her mind thought. Happy and pleased with its life\non the plains. No, it would resist her requests to change.\nIvory formed as a shield on her arm as the enemy began smashing.\nBlood on her cheek mixed with sweat; though her eye had healed, the\nregular soldiers were trying to get at her again, her honor guard doing their\nbest to hold them back.\nFine.\nShe reached out to the air, which was stagnant and morose today.\nDraining Stormlight from the gemstones at her waist, she gave it a single\ncommand. Change. No begging, as she’d tried when younger. Only\nfirmness.\nThe bored air accepted, and formed into oil all around them. It rained\nfrom the sky in a splash, and even appeared in the mouths of fighting\nsoldiers. Her honor guard knew to withdraw at that sign, coughing and\nstumbling as they stepped back from the fight around her in a ten-yard\ncircle. The enemy soldiers remained in place, cursing and coughing.\nJasnah slammed her fists together—one affixed with steel, the other with\nflint. Sparks erupted in front of her, and the entire section of the battlefield\ncame alight."

Sparks erupted in front of her, and the entire section of the battlefield\ncame alight.\nThe Magnified One stumbled in shock, and Jasnah leaped at him,\nforming Ivory into a needle-like Blade that she rammed directly into his\nchest. Her lunge was on target, and pierced the enemy’s gemheart. The\nFused toppled backward, eyes burning like the fires around her.\nShe finished off as many of the enemy soldiers as she could find in the\nflames. Her helm—transparent as glass from the inside—started to get\ncovered in soot, and soon she had to retreat out of the fire.\nHer vision was clear enough to see the horror of the nearby singers as\nthey witnessed a burning Shardbearer explode from the fires, as if from the\ncenter of Damnation itself. That fear stunned them as she hit their line like a\nboulder, working death upon the collapsing ranks. Their corpses fell among\nthe gleeful spren that writhed on the battlefield, exulting in the powerful\nemotions. Fearspren, painspren, anticipationspren.\nShe fought like a butcher. Hacking. Kicking. Throwing bodies into the\nlines to panic the others. Making waves that her soldiers exploited. At one\npoint, something slammed into her from behind, and she assumed she’d\nhave to face another Fused—but it was a dead Windrunner, dropped from\nthe skies above by a passing Heavenly One.\nShe left the dead man on the bloody ground and returned to the battle.\nShe didn’t think of strategy. Strategy was for stuffy tents and calm\nconversations over wine. She simply killed. Striking until her arms were\nsluggish despite both armor and Stormlight. Though her troops rotated, she\ndidn’t give herself that luxury. How could she? They were struggling and\nbleeding in a foreign land, for stakes she promised them were important. If\nshe rested, more of them died.\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, she found herself gasping, wiping\nblood from her helm to see. The helm opened vents on the side, bringing in\ncool fresh air, and she stumbled, standing alone on the battlefield.\nWondering why she’d started breathing again.\nRunning out of Stormlight, she thought, numb. She looked down at her\ngauntleted palm, which was stained with orange singer blood. How had she\ngotten so much on her? She vaguely remembered fighting another Fused,\nand some Regals, and …\nAnd her block of troops was marching up toward the center of the battle,\non trumpeted orders that echoed in her head. Horn blasts that meant … that\nmeant …\nJasnah, Ivory said. To the side, see what is.\nOne of the Edgedancers moved among the fallen, searching for those\nthey could heal. The second stepped up to Jasnah and pressed a large topaz\ninto her hand. He then gestured toward the rear lines.\n“I need to do more,” Jasnah said.\n“Continue in this state,” the Edgedancer said, “and you will do more\nharm than good. More soldiers will die to protect you than you will cost the\nenemy. Do you want that, Your Majesty?”\nThat cut through the numbness, and she turned to where he pointed.\nReserves formed up there, among standards proclaiming battle commanders\nand field medic stations."

Her honor guard—reduced to half its former size—followed her\nin an exhausted clot. Shoulders slumped. Faces ashen. How long had it\nbeen? She checked the sun.\nThat can’t be, she thought. Not even two hours?\nThe battle had moved away from this region, leaving corpses like fallen\nbranches behind a storm.

Or, I should say, a place that only\nexists when Wit has failed. Still, I should think I would be welcome. To\noffer a little perspective.”\nShe sighed, but didn’t object further. Most Shardbearers had crews to\nhelp keep them fighting. She did need a drink and some more Stormlight.\nShe found herself staring, however. At … well, all of it.\nWit remained quiet. He was expert at knowing when to do that, though\nadmittedly he rarely employed the knowledge.\n“I’ve read about it, you know,” she eventually said. “The feeling you get\nout there. The focus that you need to adopt to cope with it, to keep moving.\nSimply doing your job. I don’t have their training, Wit. I kept getting\ndistracted, or frightened, or confused.”\nHe tapped her hand. The closed left gauntlet, where she held the\nEdgedancer’s topaz. She stared at it, then drew in the Light. That made her\nfeel better, but not all of her fatigue was physical.\n“I’m not the unstoppable force I imagined myself to be,” she said. “They\nknow how to deal with Shardbearers; I couldn’t bring down a Fused in a\nfair fight.”\n“There are no fair fights, Jasnah,” Wit said. “There’s never been such a\nthing. The term is a lie used to impose imaginary order on something\nchaotic. Two men of the same height, age, and weapon will not fight one\nanother fairly, for one will always have the advantage in training, talent, or\nsimple luck.”\nShe grunted. Dalinar wouldn’t think much of that statement.\n“I know you feel you need to show the soldiers you can fight,” Wit said\nsoftly. “Prove to them, maybe to yourself, that you are as capable on a\nbattlefield as Dalinar is becoming with a book. This is good, it breaks down\nbarriers—and there will be those wrongheaded men who would not follow\nyou otherwise."

Talented or not, you cannot conjure for yourself a\nlifetime of experienced butchery through force of will. There is no shame in\nusing the powers you have developed. It is not unfair—or rather, it is no\nmore unfair when the most skilled swordsman on the battlefield falls to a\nstray arrow. Use what you have.”\nHe was right. She sighed, then took a piece of fruit—gripping it\ndelicately between two gauntleted fingers—and took a bite. The cool\nsweetness shocked her. It belonged to another world. It washed away the\ntaste of ash, renewing her mouth and awakening her hunger. She’d grown\nthat numb after just two hours of fighting? Her uncle had, on campaign,\nfought for hours on end—day after day.\nAnd he bore those scars, she supposed.\n“How goes the battle?” she asked.\n“Not sure,” Wit said. “But the generals were right; the enemy is\ndetermined to stand here. They must think they can win, and so let us\nperpetuate this pitched battle, rather than forcing us into temperamental\nskirmishes.”\n“So why do you sneer?”\n“It’s not a sneer,” he said. “Merely my natural charisma coming\nthrough.” He nodded to the side, to where a distant hill—small but steep-\nsided—flashed with light. Thunder cracked the air despite the open sky.\nMen tried to rush the position, and died by the dozens.\n“I think we’re coming to the end of traditional battlefield formations,”\nWit said.\n“They served us well today.”\n“And perhaps will for a time yet,” Wit said. “But not forever. Once upon\na time, military tactics could depend on breaking enemy positions with\nenough work. Enough lives. But what do you do when no rush—no number\nof brave charges—will claim the position you need?”\n“I don’t know,” she said. “But the infantry block has been a stable part of\nwarfare for millennia, Wit. It has adapted with each advance in technology.\nI don’t see it becoming obsolete any time soon.”\n“We will see. You think your powers are unfair because you slay dozens,\nand they cannot resist? What happens when a single individual can kill tens\nof thousands in moments—assuming the enemy will kindly bunch up in a\nneat little pike block. Things will change rapidly when such powers become\ncommon.”\n“They’re hardly common.”\n“I didn’t say they were,” he said. “Yet.”\nShe took a drink, and finally thought to order her honor guard to rest.\nTheir captain would send in fresh men.\nWit offered to massage her sword hand, but she shook her head. She\ninstead ate another piece of fruit, then some ration sticks he gave her to\nbalance the meal. She accepted a few pouches of spheres as well. But as\nsoon as her fresh honor guard arrived, she marched out in search of a field\ncommander who would know where to best position her.\n* * *\nSeven hours later, Jasnah tromped across a quiet battlefield, searching for\nWit.

He’d visited her several times during the fighting, but it had been hours\nsince their last encounter.\nShe hiked through the remnants of the battle, feeling an odd solitude. As\ndarkness smothered the land, she could almost pretend the scattered lumps\nwere rockbuds, not bodies. The scents, unfortunately, did not go away with\nthe light. And they remained a signal, defiant as any banner, of what had\nhappened here. Blood. The stench of burning bodies.\nIn the end, loss and victory smelled the same.\nThey sounded different though. Cheers drifted on the wind. Human\nvoices, with an edge to them. These weren’t cheers of joy, more cheers of\nrelief.\nShe made for a particular beacon of light, the tent with an illuminated set\nof coalition flags flying at the same height, one for each kingdom. Inside,\nshe’d be welcomed as a hero. When she arrived, however, she didn’t feel\nlike entering. So she settled down on a stone outside within sight of the\nguards, who were wise enough not to run and fetch anyone. She sat for\nsome time and stared out at the battlefield, figuring Wit would locate her\neventually.\n“Daunting, isn’t it?” a voice asked from the darkness.\nShe narrowed her eyes, and searched around until she found the source:\na small man sitting nearby, throwing sparks from his Herdazian sparkflicker\nin the night. Each burst of light illuminated the Mink’s fingers and face.\n“Yes,” Jasnah said. “‘Daunting’ is the right word. More so than I’d\nanticipated.”\n“You made a wise choice, going out there,” the Mink said. “Regardless\nof what the others said. It’s too easy to forget the cost. Not only to the boys\nwho die, but to the ones who live. Every commander should be reminded\nperiodically.”\n“How did we do?”\n“We broke the core of their strength,” he said. “Which is what we\nwanted—though it wasn’t a rout. We’ll need another battle or two on nearly\nthis scale before I can tell you if we’ve really won or not. But today was a\nstep forward. Do that often enough, and you’ll inevitably cross the finish\nline.”\n“Casualties?”\n“Never take casualty reports on the night of the battle, Brightness,” he\nsaid. “Give yourself a little time to enjoy the meal before you look at the\nbill.”\n“You don’t seem to be enjoying yourself.”\n“Ah, but I am,” he said. “I am staring at the open sky, and wearing no\nchains.” He stood up, a shadow against the darkness. “I’ll tell the others\nI’ve seen you, and that you are well, if you’d rather retreat to your tent.\nYour Wit is there, and unless I misunderstand, something has disturbed\nhim.”\nShe gave the Mink her thanks and stood. Wit was disturbed? The\nimplications of that harried her as she marched through the frontline\nwarcamp to her tent. Inside, Wit sat at her travel table, scribbling furiously.\nSo far, she’d caught him writing in what she thought were five different\nalien scripts, though he didn’t often answer questions about where they had\noriginated."

And he her, mostly. Other aspects of their\nrelationship were more complicated.\n“What is it, Wit?” she said.\n“My dear, you should rest before—”\n“Wit.”\nHe sighed, then leaned back in his seat. He was immaculate, as always,\nwith his perfectly styled hair and sharp black suit. For all his talk of\nfrivolity, he knew exactly how to present himself. It was something they’d\nbonded over.\n“I have failed you,” he said. “I thought I’d taken all necessary\nprecautions, but I found a pen in my writing case that did not work.”\n“So … what? Is this a trick, Wit?”\n“One played on me, I’m afraid,” he said. “The pen was not a pen, but a\ncreature designed to appear like a pen. A cremling, you’d call it, cleverly\ngrown to the shape of something innocent.”\nShe grew cold, and stepped forward, her Plate clinking. “One of the\nSleepless?”\nHe nodded.\n“How much do you think it heard?”\n“I’m uncertain. I don’t know when it replaced my real pen, and I’m\nbaffled how my protections—which are supposed to warn me of entities\nlike this—were circumvented.”\n“Then we have to assume they know everything,” Jasnah said. “All of\nour secrets.”\n“Unfortunately,” Wit said. He sighed, then pushed his notebook toward\nher. “I’m writing warnings to those I communicated with. The bright side is\nthat I don’t think any of the Sleepless are working with Odium.”\nJasnah had only recently learned that the Sleepless were anything other\nthan a myth. It had taken meeting a friendly one—seeing with her own eyes\nthat an entity could somehow be made up of thousands of cremlings\nworking in concert—for her to accept their existence.\n“If it’s not working for the enemy, then who?” she asked.\n“Well, I’ve written to my contacts among them, to ask if it is one of\ntheirs keeping a friendly eye on amiable allies. But … Jasnah, I know at\nleast one of them has thrown their lot in with the Ghostbloods.”\n“Damnation.”\n“I believe it is time,” Wit said, “that I told you about Thaidakar.”\n“I know of him,” Jasnah said.\n“Oh, you think you do,” he said. “But I’ve met him, several times. On\nother planets, Jasnah. The Ghostbloods are not a Rosharan organization,\nand I don’t think you appreciate the danger they present.…”\nAs we dig further into this project, I am left questioning the very nature\nof God.

        "text": "beaming from gemstones. A second ocean, white and pure, so omnipresent\nit became invisible.\nNavani was able to order texts brought from Kholinar, ones she’d\npresumed lost to the conquest. She was able to get others from around the\ntower, and there were even a few with relevant chapters already here in the\nlibrary room. All were collected at Raboniel’s order and delivered, without\nquestion, to Navani for study.\nShe consumed the words. Locked away as she was, she couldn’t do\nmuch else. Each day she wrote mundane instructions to her scholars—and\nhid ciphered messages within them that equated to nonsense. Rushu would\nknow what she was doing from context, but the Fused? Well, let them waste\ntheir time trying to figure out a reason to the figgldygrak she wrote. Their\nconfusion might help her slip through important messages later.\nThat didn’t take much time, and she spent the rest of her days studying\nlight. Surely there could be no harm in her learning, as Raboniel wanted.\nAnd the topic was so fascinating.\nWhat was light? Not just Stormlight, but all light. Some of the ancient\nscholars claimed you could measure it. They said it had a weight to it.\nOthers disagreed, saying instead that it was the force by which light moved\nthat one could measure.\nBoth ideas fascinated her. She’d never thought of light as a thing. It\nsimply … was.\nExcited, she performed an old experiment from her books: splitting apart\nlight into a rainbow of colors. All you had to do was put a candle in a box,\nuse a hole to focus the light, then direct it through a prism. Then, curious,\nshe extrapolated and—after several attempts—was able to use another\nprism to recombine the component colors into a beam of pure white light.\nNext, she used a diamond infused with Stormlight instead of a candle. It\nworked the same, splitting into components of light, but with a larger band\nof blue. Voidlight did the same, though the band of violet was enormous,\nand the other colors mere blips. That was strange, as her research indicated\ndifferent colors of light should only make bands brighter or weaker, not\nincrease their size.\nThe most interesting result happened when she tried the experiment on\nthe Towerlight Raboniel had collected. It wasn’t Stormlight or Lifelight, but\na combination of the two. When she tried the prism experiment with this\nlight, two separate rainbows of colors—distinct from one another—split out\nof the prism.\nShe couldn’t recombine them. When she tried sending the colors through\nanother prism, she ended up with one beam of white-blue light and a\nseparate beam of white-green light, overlapping but not combined as\nTowerlight was.\nShe sat at the table, staring at the two dots of light on the white paper.\nThat green one. Could it be Lifelight? She likely couldn’t have told the\ndifference between it and Stormlight, without the two to compare—it was\nonly next to one another that Stormlight looked faintly blue, and Lifelight\nfaintly green.\nShe stood up and dug through the trunk of personal articles she’d had\nRaboniel’s people fetch for her, looking for her journals.

        "text": "Raboniel’s people fetch for her, looking for her journals. The day of\nGavilar’s death was still painful to remember, fraught with a dozen different\nconflicting emotions. She’d recorded her impressions of that day’s events\nsix separate times, in differing emotional states. Sometimes she missed him.\nAt least the man he had once been, when they’d all schemed together as\nyouths, planning to conquer the world.\nThat was the face he’d continued to show most everyone else after he’d\nstarted to change. And so, for the good of the kingdom, Navani had played\nalong. She’d created a grand charade after his death, writing about Gavilar\nthe king, the unifier, the mighty—but just—man. The ideal monarch. She’d\ngiven him exactly what he’d wanted, exactly what she’d threatened to\nwithhold. She’d given him a legacy.\nNavani closed the journal around her finger to hold her place, then took a\nfew deep breaths. She couldn’t afford to become distracted by that tangled\nmess of emotions. She reopened the journal and turned to the account she’d\nmade of her encounter with Gavilar in her study on the day of his death.\nHe had spheres on the table, she had written. Some twenty or thirty of\nthem. He’d been showing them to his uncommon visitors—most of whom\nhave vanished, never to be seen again.\nThere was something off about those spheres. My eyes were drawn to\nseveral distinctive ones: spheres that glowed with a distinctly alien light,\nalmost negative. Both violet and black, somehow shining, yet feeling like\nthey should extinguish illumination instead of promote it.\nNavani reread the passages, then inspected the pale green light she had\nsplit out of the Towerlight. Lifelight, the Light of Cultivation. Could\nGavilar have had this Light too? Could she have mistaken Lifelight\ndiamonds for emeralds? Or, would Lifelight in a gemstone appear identical\nto a Stormlight one at a casual glance?\n“Why wouldn’t you talk to me, Gavilar?” she whispered. “Why wasn’t I\nworth trusting.…” She braced herself, then read further in her account—\nright up to the point where Gavilar plunged the knife in the deepest.\nYou aren’t worthy. That’s why, she read. You claim to be a scholar, but\nwhere are your discoveries? You study light, but you are its opposite. A\nthing that destroys light. You spend your time wallowing in the muck of the\nkitchens and obsessing about whether or not some lighteyes recognizes the\ncorrect lines on a map.\nStorms. That was so painful.\nShe forced herself to linger on his words. You are its opposite. A thing\nthat destroys light …\nGavilar had spoken of the same concept as Raboniel, of light and its\nopposite. Coincidence? Did it have to do with that sphere that bent the air?\nThe guard at her door began humming, then stepped to the side. Navani\ncould guess what that meant. Indeed, Raboniel soon entered, followed by\nthat other Fused who was so often nearby. The femalen with a similar\ntopknot and skin pattern, but a blank stare.

The second Fused was one of the more … unhinged that\nNavani had seen. Perhaps the more sane ones purposely kept an eye on\nspecific insane ones, to prevent them from hurting themselves or others.\nThe insane Fused walked over to the wall and stared at it. Raboniel\nwalked toward the desk, so Navani rose and bowed to her. “Ancient One. Is\nsomething wrong?”\n“Merely checking on your progress,” Raboniel said. Navani made room\nso Raboniel could bend down, the orange-red hair of her topknot brushing\nthe table as she inspected Navani’s experiment: a box letting out the\nillumination from a Towerlight gemstone, which was split through a prism,\nthen recombined through another into two separate streams of light.\n“Incredible,” Raboniel said. “This is what you do when you experiment,\ninstead of fighting against me? Look, Stormlight and Lifelight. As I said.”\n“Yes, Ancient One,” Navani said. “I’ve been reading about light. The\nillumination that comes from the sun or candles cannot be stored in\ngemstones, but Stormlight can. So what is Stormlight? It is not simply\nillumination, as it gives off illumination.\n“It’s as if Stormlight is at times a liquid. It behaves like one when you\ndraw it from a full gemstone into an empty one, mimicking osmosis. While\ncaptured, the illumination given off by Stormlight behaves like sunlight: it\ncan be split by a prism, and diffuses the farther it gets from its source. But\nthe Stormlight must be different from the illumination it radiates.\nOtherwise, how could we hold it in a gemstone?”\n“Can you combine them?” Raboniel asked. “Stormlight and Voidlight,\ncan they be mixed?”\n“To prove that humans and singers can be unified,” Navani said.\n“Yes, of course. For that reason.”\nShe’s lying, Navani thought. She couldn’t be certain, as singers often\nacted in strange ways, but Navani suspected more here.\nThe strange insane Fused began saying something in their language. She\nstared up at the wall, then said it louder.\nRaboniel glanced at her, hummed softly, then looked at Navani. “Have\nyou discovered anything more?”\n“That’s about it,” Navani said. “I couldn’t get Lifelight and Stormlight to\nrecombine, but I don’t know if this counts as truly splitting them apart—as\nI’ve only split their radiation, not the pooled Light itself.”\n“I’ve thought about your mixing of oil and water, and I am intrigued. We\nneed to know. Can Stormlight and Voidlight be mixed? What would happen\nif they were combined?”\n“You are quite focused on that idea, Ancient One,” Navani said,\nthoughtfully leaning back. “Why?”\n“It’s why I came here,” Raboniel said.\n“Not to conquer?

What would that alliance\nbe like, to you, if we could achieve it?”\nRaboniel hummed a rhythm and opened Navani’s box, taking out the\nsphere of Towerlight. “The war has stretched so long, I’ve seen this kind of\ntactic play out dozens of times. We have never held the tower before, true,\nbut we’ve seized Oathgates, taken command posts, and held the capital of\nAlethela a couple of times. All part of an eternal, endless slog of a war. I\nwant to end it. I need to find the tools to truly end it, for all of our …\nsanity.”\n“End how?” Navani pressed. “If we work together like you want, what\nhappens to my people?”\nRaboniel turned the Towerlight sphere over in her fingers, ignoring the\nquestion. “We’ve known about this new Light ever since the tower was\ncreated—but I am the one who theorized it was Stormlight and Lifelight\ncombined. You have confirmed this. This is proof. Proof that what I want to\ndo is possible.”\n“Have you ever heard of spheres that warp the air around them?” Navani\nasked. “Like they were extremely hot?”\nRaboniel’s rhythm cut off. She turned toward Navani. “Where did you\nhear of such a thing?”\n“I remembered a conversation about it,” Navani lied, “from long ago—\nwith someone who claimed to have seen one.”\n“There are theories,” Raboniel said. “Matter has its opposite: negative\naxi that destroy positive axi when combined. This is known, and confirmed\nby the Shards Odium and Honor. So some have thought … is there a\nnegative to light? An anti-light? I had discarded this idea. After all, I\nassumed that if there was an opposite to Stormlight, it would be Voidlight.”\n“Except,” Navani said, “we have no reason to believe that Stormlight\nand Voidlight are opposites. Tell me, what would happen if this theoretical\nnegative light were to combine with its positive?”\n“Destruction,” Raboniel said. “Instantaneous annihilation.”\nNavani felt cold. She’d told her scholars—the ones to whom she’d\nentrusted Szeth’s strange sphere—to experiment with the air-warping light.\nTo move it to different gemstones, to try using it in fabrials. Could it be\nthat … they’d somehow mixed that sphere’s contents with ordinary\nVoidlight?\n“Continue your experiments,” Raboniel said, putting down the sphere.\n“Anything you need for your science shall be yours. If you can combine\nVoidlight and Stormlight without destroying them—therefore proving they\nare not opposites … well, I should like to know this. It will require me to\ndiscard years upon years of theories.”\n“I have no idea where to begin,” Navani protested. “If you let me have\nmy team back…”\n“Write them instructions and put them to work,” Raboniel said. “You\nhave them still.”\n“Fine,” Navani said, “but I have no idea what I’m doing. If I were trying\nto do this with liquids, I’d use an emulsifier—but what kind of emulsifier\ndoes one use on light? It defies reason.”"

This knowledge is worth more than any one\nlocation, no matter how strategic.”\nI’m sure, Navani thought. She didn’t believe for a single heartbeat that\nRaboniel would do so—but at the same time, this knowledge would\nobviously give Navani an edge. Why did Raboniel want to prove, or\ndisprove, that the two Lights were opposites? What was her game here?\nShe wants a weapon, perhaps? That explosion I inadvertently caused? Is\nthat what Raboniel is hunting?\nThe Fused by the wall started talking again, louder this time. Again\nRaboniel hummed and glanced over.\n“What does she say?” Navani asked.\n“She … asks if anyone has seen her mother. She’s trying to get the wall\nto talk.”\n“Her mother?” Navani thought, cocking her head. She hadn’t thought\nthat the Fused would have parents—but of course they did. The creatures\nhad been born mortal, thousands of years ago. “What happened to her\nmother?”\n“She’s right here,” Raboniel said softly, gesturing to herself. “That was\nanother hypothesis of mine that was disproven. Long ago. The thought that\na mother and daughter, serving together, might help one another retain their\nsanity.”\nRaboniel walked to her daughter and turned her to steer her out the door.\nAnd while singers tended not to show emotion on their faces, Navani\nthought for sure she could read pain in Raboniel’s expression—a wince—as\nthe daughter continued to ask for her mother. All the while staring\nunseeingly past her.\nI am not convinced any of the gods can be destroyed, so perhaps I\nmisspoke. They can change state however, like a spren—or like the\nvarious Lights.

Pure white lines, thin as a hair. Some moved, though one end\nremained affixed to the central point: the place where Dalinar’s finger\ntouched the soldier’s skin.\n“I see them,” he whispered. “Finally.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled in the back of his mind. I was not certain it\ncould be done, he said. The power of Bondsmiths was tempered by Honor,\nfor the good of all.

Think on a scale bigger than one battle, or even one\nwar. It was difficult, with how slowly his skills seemed to be progressing.\nSo much time wasted. Was this what Jasnah had experienced all those\nyears, chasing secrets when nobody else had believed her?\nHe had another duty today, in addition to his practice. He’d been putting\nit off, but he knew he should delay no longer. So, he collected Szeth and\nwalked through the camp, turning his path toward the prison.\nHe needed to talk to Taravangian in person.\nThe building that housed the former king was not a true prison. They\nhadn’t planned for one of those in the temporary warcamp here in Emul. A\nstockade, yes. But military discipline was by necessity quick. Anything\ndemanding more than a week or two in confinement usually resulted in a\ndischarge or—for more serious infractions—an execution.\nTaravangian required something more permanent and more delicate.

So\nthey’d blocked off the windows on a sturdy home, reinforced the door, and\nset guards from among Dalinar’s best soldiers. As Dalinar approached, he\nnoted how the upper-floor windows were now filled with stark crem bricks,\nmortared into place. It had felt wrong to give Taravangian a home instead of\na cell—but seeing those windows, it also felt wrong to leave him without\nsunlight.\nDalinar nodded to the salutes at the door, then waited for the guards to\nundo the locks and pull the door open for him. Nobody worried about his\nsafety or made a comment about his single guard. They all thought the\nprecautions were to prevent Taravangian from being rescued, and would\nnever have wondered whether the Blackthorn could handle himself against\nan elderly statesman.\nThey didn’t have any inkling, even now, how dangerous Taravangian\nwas. He sat on a stool near the far wall of the main room. He’d put a ruby\ninto the corner and was staring at it. He turned when Dalinar entered, and\nactually smiled. Storming man.\nDalinar waved for Szeth to remain right inside the door as the guards\nclosed and locked it behind them. Then Dalinar approached the corner,\nwary. He’d charged into many a battle with less trepidation than he now\nfelt.\n“I had wondered if you would come,” Taravangian said. “It has been\nnearly two weeks since my betrayal.”\n“I wanted to be certain I wasn’t somehow being manipulated,” Dalinar\nsaid, honestly. “So I waited until certain tasks were accomplished before\ncoming to you, and risking letting you influence me.”\nThough, deep down, Dalinar admitted that was mostly an excuse. Seeing\nthis man was painful. Perhaps he should have let Jasnah interrogate\nTaravangian, as she’d suggested. But that seemed the coward’s route.\n“Ah, certain tasks are accomplished, then?” the old man asked. “By now\nyou’ve surely recovered from the betrayal of the Veden armies. You’ve\nclashed with Odium’s forces in Emul? I warned Odium that we should have\nmoved earlier, but he was adamant, you see. This was the way he wanted it\nto happen.”\nThe frankness of it felt like a boot directly to Dalinar’s gut. He steeled\nhimself. “That stool is too uncomfortable for a man of your years. You\nshould be given a chair. I thought they’d left the building furnished. Do you\nhave a bed? And surely they gave you more than a single sphere for light.”\n“Dalinar, Dalinar,” Taravangian whispered. “If you wish me to have\ncomfort, don’t ask after the chair or the light. Answer my questions and talk\nto me. I need that more than—”\n“Why?” Dalinar interrupted. He held Taravangian’s gaze, and was\nshocked at how much asking the question hurt. He’d known the betrayal\nwas coming. He’d known what this man was. Nevertheless, the words were\nagonizing as they slipped from his lips again. “Why? Why did you do it?”\n“Because, Dalinar, you’re going to lose. I’m sorry, my friend. It is\nunavoidable.”\n“You can’t know that.”"

It is\nunavoidable.”\n“You can’t know that.”\n“Yet I do.” He sagged in his seat, turning toward the corner and the\nglowing sphere. “Such a poor imitation of our comfortable sitting room in\nUrithiru. Even that was a poor imitation of a real hearth, crackling with true\nflames, alive and beautiful. An imitation of an imitation.\n“That’s what we are, Dalinar. A painting made from another painting of\nsomething great. Perhaps the ancient Radiants could have won this fight,\nwhen Honor lived. They didn’t. They barely survived. Now we face a god.\nAlone. There is no victory awaiting us.”\nDalinar felt … cold. Not shocked. Not surprised. He supposed he could\nhave figured out Taravangian’s reasoning; they’d talked often about what it\nmeant to be a king. The discussions had grown more intense, more\nmeaningful, once Dalinar had realized what Taravangian had done to\nacquire the throne of Jah Keved. Once he’d known that—instead of chatting\nwith a kindly old man with strange ideals—he had been talking to another\nmurderer. A man like Dalinar himself.\nNow he felt disappointed. Because in the end, Taravangian had let that\nside of him rule. No longer on the edge. His friend—yes, they were friends\n—had stepped off the cliff.\n“We can defeat him, Taravangian,” Dalinar said. “You are not nearly so\nsmart as you think.”\n“I agree. I was once, though.” He clarified, perhaps noticing Dalinar’s\nconfusion. “I visited the Old Magic, Dalinar. I saw her. Not just the\nNightwatcher, I suspect, but the other one. The one you saw.”\n“Cultivation,” he said. “There is one who can face Odium. There were\nthree gods.”\n“She won’t fight him,” Taravangian said. “She knows. How do you think\nI found out we’d lose?”\n“She told you that?” Dalinar strode forward, squatting down beside\nTaravangian, coming to eye level with the aged man. “She said Odium\nwould win?”\n“I asked her for the capacity to stop what was coming,” Taravangian\nsaid. “And she made me brilliant, Dalinar. Transcendently brilliant, but just\nonce. For a day. I vary, you know. Some days I’m smart, but my emotions\nseem stunted—I don’t feel anything but annoyance. Other days I’m stupid,\nbut the tiniest bit of sentimentality sends me into tears. Most days I’m like I\nam today. Some shade of average.\n“Only one day of brilliance. One single day. I’ve often wished I’d get\nanother, but I guess that was all that Cultivation wanted me to have. She\nwanted me to see for myself. There was no way to save Roshar.”\n“You saw no possible out?” Dalinar said. “Tell me honestly. Was there\nabsolutely no way to win?”\nTaravangian fell silent.\n“Nobody can see the future perfectly,” Dalinar said. “Not even Odium.

I\nfind it impossible to believe that you, no matter how smart, could have been\nabsolutely certain there was no path to victory.”\n“Let’s say you were in my place,” Taravangian said. “You saw a shadow\nof the future, the best anyone has ever seen it. Better, in fact, than any\nmortal could achieve. And you saw a path to saving Alethkar—everyone\nyou love, everything you know. You saw a very plausible, very reasonable\nopportunity to accomplish this goal.\n“But you also saw that to do more—to save the world itself—you would\nhave to rely on such wild bets as to be ludicrous. And if you failed at those\nvery, very, very long odds, you’d lose everything. Tell me honestly, Dalinar.\nWould you not consider doing what I did, taking the rational choice of\nsaving the few?” Taravangian’s eyes glistened. “Isn’t that the way of the\nsoldier? Accept your losses, and do what you can?”\n“So you sold us out? You helped hasten our destruction?”\n“For a price, Dalinar,” Taravangian said, staring again at the ruby that\nwas the room’s hearth. “I did preserve Kharbranth. I tried, I promise you, to\nprotect more. But it is as the Radiants say. Life before death. I saved the\nlives of as many as I could—”\n“Don’t use that phrase,” Dalinar said. “Don’t sully it, Taravangian, with\nyour crass justifications.”\n“Still standing on your high tower, Dalinar?” Taravangian asked. “Proud\nof how far you can see, when you won’t look past your own feet? Yes,\nyou’re very noble. How wonderful you are, fighting until the end, dragging\nevery human to death with you. They can all die knowing you never\ncompromised.”\n“I made an oath,” Dalinar said, “to protect the people of Alethkar. It was\nmy oath as a highprince. After that, a greater oath—the oath of a Radiant.”\n“And is that how you protected the Alethi years ago, Dalinar? When you\nburned them alive in their cities?”\nDalinar drew in a sharp breath, but refused to rise to that barb. “I’m not\nthat man any longer. I changed. I take the next step, Taravangian.”\n“I suppose that is true, and my statement was a useless gibe. I wish you\nwere that man who would burn one city to preserve the kingdom. I could\nwork with that man, Dalinar. Make him see.”\n“See that I should turn traitor?”\n“Yes. As you live now, protecting people isn’t your true ideal. If that\nwere the case, you’d surrender. No, your true ideal is never giving up. No\nmatter the cost. You realize the pride in that sentiment?”\n“I refuse to accept that we’ve lost,” Dalinar said. “That’s the problem\nwith your worldview, Taravangian. You gave up before the battle started.\nYou think you’re smart enough to know the future, but I repeat: Nobody\nknows for certain what will happen.”"

You gave up before the battle started.\nYou think you’re smart enough to know the future, but I repeat: Nobody\nknows for certain what will happen.”\nStrangely, the older man nodded. “Yes, yes perhaps. I could be wrong.\nThat would be wonderful, wouldn’t it, Dalinar? I’d die happy, knowing I\nwas wrong.”\n“Would you?” Dalinar said.\nTaravangian considered. Then he turned abruptly—a motion that caused\nSzeth to jump, stepping forward, hand on his sword. Taravangian, however,\nwas just turning to point at a nearby stool for Dalinar to sit.\nTaravangian glanced at Szeth briefly and hesitated. Dalinar thought he\ncaught a narrowing of the man’s eyes. Damnation. He’d figured it out.\nThe moment was over in a second. “That stool,” Taravangian said,\npointing again. “I carried it down from upstairs. In case you visited. Would\nyou join me here, sitting as we once did? For old times’ sake?”\nDalinar frowned. He didn’t want to take the seat out of principle, but that\nwas prideful. He would sit with this man one last time. Taravangian was\none of the few people who truly understood what it felt like to make the\nchoices that Dalinar had. Dalinar pulled over the stool and settled down.\n“I would die happily,” Taravangian said, “if I could see that I was wrong.\nIf you won.”\n“I don’t think you would. I don’t think you could stand not being the one\nwho saved us.”\n“How little you know me, despite it all.”\n“You didn’t come to me, or any of us,” Dalinar said. “You say you were\nextremely smart? You figured out what was going to happen? What was\nyour response? It wasn’t to form a coalition; it wasn’t to refound the\nRadiants. It was to send out an assassin, then seize the throne of Jah\nKeved.”\n“So I would be in a position to negotiate with Odium.”\n“That argument is crem, Taravangian. You didn’t need to murder people\n—you didn’t need to be king of Jah Keved—to accomplish any of this. You\nwanted to be an emperor. You made a play for Alethkar too. You sent Szeth\nto kill me, instead of talking to me.”\n“Pardon, Blackthorn, but please remember the man you were when I\nbegan this. He would not have listened to me.”\n“You’re so smart you can predict who will win a war before it begins,\nbut you couldn’t see that I was changing? You couldn’t see that I’d be more\nvaluable as an ally than as a corpse?”\n“I thought you would fall, Dalinar. I predicted you would join Odium, if\nleft alive. Either that or you would fight my every step. Odium thought the\nsame.”\n“And you were both wrong,” Dalinar said. “So your grand plan, your\nmasterful ‘vision’ of the future was simply wrong.”\n“I … I…” Taravangian rubbed his brow. “I don’t have the intelligence\nright now to explain it to you. Odium will arrange things so that no matter\nwhat choice you make, he will win. Knowing that, I made the difficult"

Knowing that, I made the difficult\ndecision to save at least one city.”\n“I think you saw a chance to be an emperor, and you took it,” Dalinar\nsaid. “You wanted power, Taravangian—so you could give it up. You\nwanted to be the glorious king who sacrificed himself to protect everyone\nelse. You have always seen yourself as the man who must bear the burden\nof leading.”\n“Because it’s true.”\n“Because you like it.”\n“If so, why did I let go? Why am I captured here?”\n“Because you want to be known as the one who saved us.”\n“No,” Taravangian said. “It’s because I knew my friends and family\ncould escape if I let you take me. I knew that your wrath would come upon\nme, not Kharbranth. And as I’m sure you’ve discovered, those who knew\nwhat I was doing are no longer involved in the city’s government. If you\nwere to attack Kharbranth, you would attack innocents.”\n“I’d never do that.”\n“Because you have me. Admit it.”\nStorm him, it was true—and it made Dalinar angry enough to draw a\nsingle boiling angerspren at his feet. He had no interest in retribution\nagainst Kharbranth. They, like the Vedens—like Dalinar himself—had all\nbeen pawns in Taravangian’s schemes.\n“I know it is difficult to accept,” Taravangian said. “But my goal has\nnever been power. It has always only been about saving whomever I could\nsave.”\n“I can’t debate that, as I don’t know your heart, Taravangian,” Dalinar\nsaid. “So instead I’ll tell you something I know for certain. It could have\ngone differently. You could have truly joined with us. Storms … I can\nimagine a world where you said the oaths. I imagine you as a better leader\nthan I ever could have been. I feel like you were so close.”\n“No, my friend,” Taravangian said. “A monarch cannot make such oaths\nand expect to be able to keep them. He must realize that a greater need\nmight arise at any time.”\n“If so, it’s impossible for a king to be a moral man.”\n“Or perhaps you can be moral and still break oaths.”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “No, oaths are part of what define morality,\nTaravangian. A good man must strive to accomplish the things he’s\ncommitted to do.”\n“Spoken like a true son of Tanavast,” Taravangian said, clasping his\nhands. “And I believe you, Dalinar. I believe you think exactly what you\nsay. You are a man of Honor, raised to it through a life of his religion—\nwhich you might be upending, but it retains its grip on your mind.\n“I wish I could commend that. Perhaps there was another way out of\nthis. Perhaps there was another solution. But it wouldn’t be found in your\noaths, my friend. And it would not involve a coalition of noble leaders. It\nwould involve the sort of business with which you were once so familiar.”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “There is a just way to victory. The methods must"

The methods must\nmatch the ideal to be obtained.”\nTaravangian nodded, as if this were the inevitable response. Dalinar sat\nback on his seat, and they sat in silence together for a time, watching the\ntiny ruby. He hated how this had gone, how the argument forced him into\nthe most dogmatic version of his beliefs. He knew there was nuance in\nevery position, yet …\nAligning his methods and his goals was at the very soul of what he’d\nlearned. What he was trying to become. He had to believe there was a way\nto lead while still being moral.\nHe stared at that ruby, that glimmer of red light, reminiscent of an\nEverstorm’s lightning. Dalinar had come here expecting a fight, but was\nsurprised to realize he felt more sorrow than he did anger. He felt\nTaravangian’s pain, his regret for what had occurred. What they had both\nlost.\nDalinar finally stood up. “You always said that to be a king was to accept\npain.”\n“To accept that you must do what others cannot,” Taravangian agreed.\n“To bear the agonies of the decisions you had to make, so that others may\nlive pure lives. You should know that I have said my goodbyes and\nintentionally made myself worthless to Odium and my former compatriots.\nYou will not be able to use my life to bargain with anyone.”\n“Why tell me this?” Dalinar said. “You would make it worthless to keep\nyou prisoner. Do you want to be executed?”\n“I simply want to be clear with you,” Taravangian said. “There is no\nfurther reason for me to try to manipulate you, Dalinar. I have achieved\nwhat I wanted. You may kill me.”\n“No, Taravangian,” Dalinar said. “You have lived your convictions,\nhowever misguided they may be. Now I’m going to live mine. And at the\nend, when I face Odium and win, you will be there. I’ll give you this gift.”\n“The pain of knowing I was wrong?”\n“You told me earlier that you wished to be proven wrong. If you’re\nsincere—and this was never about being right or about gaining power—\nthen on that day we can embrace, knowing it is all over. Old friend.”\nTaravangian looked at him, and there were tears in his eyes. “To that day,\nthen,” he whispered. “And to that embrace.”\nDalinar nodded and withdrew, collecting Szeth at the door. He paused\nbriefly to tell the guards to bring Taravangian some more light and a\ncomfortable chair.\nAs they walked away, Szeth spoke from behind him. “Do not trust his\nlies. He pretends to be done plotting, but there is more to him. There is\nalways more to that one.”\nDalinar glanced at the stoic bodyguard. Szeth so rarely offered opinions.\n“I don’t trust him,” Dalinar said. “I can’t walk away from any\nconversation with that man, no matter how innocent, without going over\nand over what he said. That’s part of why I was so hesitant to go in there.”\n“You are wise,” Szeth said, and seemed to consider the conversation\nfinished."

This notebook was a dream we\nshared, which is itself a beautiful thing. Proof of the truth of my intent,\neven if the project was ultimately doomed.\n—From Rhythm of War, page 27\nVenli scrambled through the hallways of Urithiru. She shoved past a group\nof humans who were too slow to get out of the way, then pulled to a halt,\nbreathing heavily as she looked out onto the balcony.\nThat song … That song reminded her of her mother’s voice.\nBut it wasn’t her, of course. The femalen who sat by the balcony—\nweaving a mat and singing to Peace—was not Jaxlim. Her red skin pattern\nwas wrong, her hairstrands too short. Venli leaned against the stone\ndoorway as others on the balcony noticed her, and the femalen’s voice cut\noff. She glanced toward Venli and began to hum to Anxiety.\nVenli turned and walked away, attuning Disappointment. Hopefully she\nhadn’t frightened the people. A Regal looking so wild must have given them\na scare.\nTimbre pulsed inside her.\n“I keep hearing her songs,” Venli said. “In the voices of people I pass. I\nkeep remembering those days when I sang with her. I miss those days,\nTimbre. Life was so simple then.”\nTimbre pulsed to the Lost.\n“She didn’t have much sense left when my betrayal came,” Venli\nexplained to the spren’s question. “Part of me thinks that a mercy, as she\nnever knew. About me … Anyway it was the storms that eventually killed\nher. She was with the group that escaped, but they fled into the chasms. And\nthen … we did what we did. The flood that came upon the Plains that\nday … Timbre, she drowned down there. Dead by my hand as surely as if\nI’d stabbed her.”\nThe little spren pulsed again, consoling. She felt Venli couldn’t\ncompletely be blamed for what she’d done, as the forms had influenced her\nmind. But Venli had chosen those forms.\nShe often thought back to those early days, after releasing Ulim. Yes, her\nemotions had changed. She’d pursued her ambition more and more. But at\nthe same time, she hadn’t responded like Eshonai, who had seemed to\nbecome a different person entirely when adopting a form of power. Venli\nseemed more resistant somehow. More herself, regardless of form.\nThat should have made her attune Joy, for she could only guess this had\nhelped her escape Odium’s grip. But it also made her responsible for what\nshe’d done. She couldn’t blame it on spren or forms. She’d been there,\ngiving those orders.\nTimbre pulsed. I helped. And … yes, she had. When she’d first appeared,\nVenli had grown stronger, more able to resist.\n“Thank you,” Venli said. “For that, and for what you continue to do. I’m\nnot worthy of your faith. But thank you.”\nTimbre pulsed. Today was the day. Raboniel was spending all her time"

        "text": "not worthy of your faith. But thank you.”\nTimbre pulsed. Today was the day. Raboniel was spending all her time\nwith Navani, and seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the difficulty of\nmanipulating the former queen. That left Venli free. She’d secured a small\nsack of gemstones, some with Voidlight, some with Stormlight.\nToday she was going to see what it really meant to be on this path of\nRadiance.\nShe’d already selected an area in which to practice. During morning\nreports, Venli had learned the Pursuer’s scouts were carefully combing the\nfifteenth floor. The majority of Raboniel’s soldiers were busy watching the\nhumans, and didn’t often venture to the higher floors. So Venli had chosen a\nplace on the eighth floor—a place that the Pursuer had already searched, but\nthat was far from population centers.\nThe tower up here was silent, and oddly reminded her of the chasms in\nthe Shattered Plains. Those stone pits had also been a place where the sun\nwas difficult to remember—and also a place resplendent with beautiful\nstone.\nShe ran her fingers across a wall, expecting to feel bumps from the\nvibrant strata lines, but it was smooth. Like the walls of the chasms,\nactually. Her mother had died in those pits. Likely terrified, unable to\nunderstand what was happening as the water rushed in and …\nVenli attuned the Lost and put down her small sack of spheres. She took\nout a Stormlight one first, then glimpsed into Shadesmar. She hadn’t again\nseen the Voidspren she’d spotted near Rlain’s cell, though she’d watched\ncarefully these last few days. She’d eventually put Rlain together with the\nsurgeon and his wife, and delivered all three of them to help care for the\nfallen Radiants.\nShadesmar revealed no Voidspren hiding in cremlings, so she hesitantly\nreturned her vision to the Physical Realm and drew in a breath of\nStormlight. That she could do, as she’d practiced it together with Timbre\nover the months.\nStormlight didn’t work like Voidlight did. Rather than going into her\ngemheart, it infused her entire body. She could feel it raging—an odd\nfeeling more than an unpleasant one.\nShe pressed her hand to the stone wall. “Do you remember how we did\nthis last time?” she asked Timbre.\nThe little spren pulsed uncertainly. That had been many months ago, and\nhad drawn the attention of secretspren, so they had stopped quickly. It\nseemed, though, that all Venli had needed to do was press her hand against\nthe wall, and her powers had started activating.\nTimbre pulsed. She wasn’t convinced it would work with Stormlight, not\nwith the tower’s defenses in place. Indeed, as Venli tried to do … well,\nanything with the Stormlight, she felt as if there were some invisible wall\nblocking her.\nShe couldn’t push the Stormlight into her gemheart to store it there—not\nwith the Voidspren trapped inside. So Venli let the Light burn off on its\nown, breathing out to hasten the process. Then she took out a Voidlight\nsphere. She could get these without too much trouble—but she didn’t dare\nsing the Song of Prayer to create them herself. She worried about drawing"

She could get these without too much trouble—but she didn’t dare\nsing the Song of Prayer to create them herself. She worried about drawing\nOdium’s attention; he seemed to be ignoring her these days, and she’d\nrather it remain that way.\nTimbre pulsed encouragingly.\n“You sure?” Venli said. “It doesn’t seem right, for some reason, to use\nhis power to fuel our abilities.”\nTimbre’s pulsed reply was pragmatic. Indeed, they used Voidlight every\nday—a little of it, stored in their gemheart—to power Venli’s translation\nabilities. She wasn’t certain if her ability to use Voidlight for Radiant\npowers came from the fact that she was Regal, or if any singer who\nmanaged a bond would be able to do the same.\nToday, she drew the Voidlight in like Stormlight, and it infused her\ngemheart fully. The Voidlight didn’t push her to move or act, like the\nStormlight had. Instead it enflamed her emotions, in this case making her\nmore paranoid, so she checked Shadesmar again. Still nothing there to be\nalarmed about.\nShe pressed her hand to the wall again, and tried to feel the stone. Not\nwith her fingers. With her soul.\nThe stone responded. It seemed to stir like a person awaking from a deep\nslumber. Hello, it said, though the sounds were drawn out. She didn’t hear\nthe word so much as feel it. You are … familiar.\n“I am Venli,” she said. “Of the listeners.”\nThe stones trembled. They spoke with one voice, but she felt as if it was\nalso many voices overlapping. Not the voice of the tower, but the voices of\nthe many different sections of stones around her. The walls, the ceiling, the\nfloor.\nRadiant, the stones said. We have … missed your touch, Radiant. But\nwhat is this? What is that sound, that tone?\n“Voidlight,” Venli admitted.\nThat sound is familiar, the stones said. A child of the ancient ones. Our\nfriend, you have returned to sing our song again?\n“What song?” Venli asked.\nThe stone near her hand began to undulate, like ripples on the surface of\na pond. A tone surged through her, then it began to pulse with the song of a\nrhythm she’d never heard, but somehow always known. A profound,\nsonorous rhythm, ancient as the core of Roshar.\nThe entire wall followed suit, then the ceiling and the floor, surrounding\nher with a beautiful rhythm set to a pure tone. Timbre, with glee, joined in\n—and so Venli’s body aligned with the rhythm, and she felt it humming\nthrough her, vibrating her from carapace to bones.\nShe gasped, then pressed her other hand to the rock, aching to feel the\nsong against her skin. There was a rightness about this, a perfection.\nOh, storms, she thought. Oh, rhythms ancient and new. I belong here.\nShe belonged here.\nSo far, everything she’d done with Timbre had been accidental. There\nhad been a momentum to it. She’d made choices along the way, but it had\nnever felt like something she deserved. Rather, it was a path she had fallen"

Rather, it was a path she had fallen\ninto, and then taken because it was better than her other options.\nBut here … she belonged here.\nRemember, the stones said. The ground in front of her stopped rippling\nand formed shapes. Little homes made of stone, with figures standing\nbeside them. Shaping them. She heard them humming.\nShe saw them. Ancient people, the Dawnsingers, working the stone.\nCreating cities, tools. They didn’t need Soulcasting or forges. They’d dip\nlengths of wood into the stone, and come out with axes. They’d shape\nbowls with their fingers. All the while, the stone would sing to them.\nFeel me, shaper. Create from me. We are one. The stone shapes your life\nas you shape the stone.\nWelcome home, child of the ancients.\n“How?” Venli asked. “Radiants didn’t exist then. Spren didn’t bond\nus … did they?”\nThings are new, the stones hummed, but new things are made from old\nthings, and old peoples give birth to new ones. Old stones remember.\nThe vibrations quieted, falling from powerful thrummings, to tiny\nripples, to stillness. The homes and the people melted back to ordinary\nstone floor, though the strata of this place had changed. As if to echo the\nformer vibrations.\nVenli knelt. After several minutes, breathing in gasps, she realized she\nwas completely out of Voidlight. She searched her sack, and found all of her\nspheres drained save for a single mark. She’d gone through those spheres\nwith frightening speed. But that moment of song, that moment of\nconnection, had certainly been worth the cost.\nShe drew in this mark, then hesitantly placed her hand to the wall again.\nShe felt the stone, willing and pliable, encouraging her and calling her\n“shaper.” She drew out the Voidlight and it infused her hand, making it\nglow violet-on-black. When she pressed her thumb into the stone, the rock\nmolded beneath her touch, as if it had become crem clay.\nVenli pressed her entire hand into the stone, making a print there and\nfeeling the soft—but still present—rhythm. Then she pulled off a piece of\nthe rock and molded it in her fingers. She rolled it into a ball, and the\nviscosity seemed to match what she needed—for when she held her hand\nforward and imagined it doing so, the stone ball melted into a puddle. She\ndropped it then, and it clicked when it hit the ground—hard, but imprinted\nby her fingers.\nShe picked it up and pressed it back into the wall, where it melded with\nthe stone there as if it had never been removed.\nOnce she was done, she considered. “I want this, Timbre,” she\nwhispered, wiping her eyes. “I need this.”\nTimbre thrummed excitedly.\n“What do you mean, ‘them’?” Venli asked. She looked up, noticing\nlights in the hallway. She attuned Anxiety, but then the lights drew closer.\nThe three little spren were like Timbre: in the shape of comets with rings of\nlight pulsing around them."

She attuned Anxiety, but then the lights drew closer.\nThe three little spren were like Timbre: in the shape of comets with rings of\nlight pulsing around them.\n“This is dangerous,” Venli hissed to Reprimand. “They shouldn’t be\nhere. If they’re seen, the Voidspren will destroy them.”\nTimbre pulsed that spren couldn’t be destroyed. Cut them with a\nShardblade, and they’d re-form. Venli, however, wasn’t so confident. Surely\nthe Fused could do something. Trap them in a jar? Lock them away?\nTimbre insisted they’d simply fade into Shadesmar in that case, and be\nfree. Well, it was risky, no matter what she said. These spren seemed\nmore … awake than she’d expected though. They hovered around her,\ncurious.\n“Didn’t you say spren like you need a bond to be aware in the Physical\nRealm? An anchor?”\nTimbre’s explanation was slightly ashamed. These were eager to bond\nVenli’s friends, her squires. That had given these spren access to thoughts\nand stability in the Physical Realm. Venli was the anchor.\nShe nodded. “Tell them to get out of the tower for now. If my friends\nstart suddenly manifesting Radiant powers—and the stone starts singing in\na place others could see—we could find ourselves in serious trouble.”\nTimbre pulsed, defiant. How long?\n“Until I find a way out of this mess,” Venli said. She pressed her hand to\nthe wall, listening to the soft, contented hum of the stones. “I’m like a baby\ntaking her first steps. But this might be the answer we need. If I can sculpt\nus an exit through the collapsed tunnels below, I should be able to sneak us\nout. Maybe we can even make it seem like we died in a further cave-in,\ncovering our escape.”\nTimbre pulsed encouragingly.\n“You’re correct,” Venli said. “We can do this. But we need to take it\nslowly, carefully. I rushed to find new forms, and that proved a disaster.\nThis time we’ll do things the right way.”\nEIGHT YEARS AGO\nEshonai accompanied her mother into the storm.\nTogether they struck out into the electric darkness, Eshonai carrying a\nlarge wooden shield to buffer the wind for her mother, who cradled the\nbright orange glowing gemstone. Powerful gusts tried to rip the shield out\nof Eshonai’s hand, and windspren soared past, giggling.\nEshonai and her mother passed others, notable for the similar gemstones\nthey carried. Little bursts of light in the tempest. Like the souls of the dead\nsaid to wander the storms, searching for gemhearts to inhabit.\nEshonai attuned the Rhythm of the Terrors: sharp, each beat puncturing\nher mind. She wasn’t afraid for herself, but her mother had been so frail\nlately.\nThough many of the others stood out in the open, Eshonai led her mother\nto the hollow she’d picked out earlier. Even here, the pelting rain felt like it\nwas trying to burrow through her skin. Rainspren along the top of the ridge\nseemed to dance as they waved along with the furious tempest."

Rainspren along the top of the ridge\nseemed to dance as they waved along with the furious tempest.\nEshonai huddled down beside her mother, unable to hear the rhythm the\nfemalen was humming. The light of the gemstone, however, revealed a grin\non Jaxlim’s face.\nA grin?\n“Reminds me of when your father and I came out together!” Jaxlim\nshouted at Eshonai over the stormwinds. “We’d decided not to leave it to\nfate, where one of us might be taken and the other not! I still remember the\nstrange feelings of passion when I first changed. You’re too afraid of that,\nEshonai! I do want grandchildren, you realize.”\n“Do we have to talk about this now?” Eshonai asked. “Hold that stone.\nAdopt the new form! Think about it, not mateform.”\nWouldn’t that be an embarrassment.\n“The lifespren aren’t interested in someone my age,” her mother said. “It\nsimply feels nice to be out here again! I’d been beginning to think I would\nwaste away!”\nTogether they huddled against the rock, Eshonai using her shield as an\nimprovised roof to block the rain. She wasn’t certain how long it would take\nthe transformation to begin. Eshonai herself had only adopted a new form\nonce, as a child—when her father had helped her adopt workform, since the\ntime of changes had come to her.\nChildren needed no form, and were vibrant without one—but if they\ndidn’t adopt a form upon puberty in their seventh or eighth year, they would\nbe trapped in dullform instead. That form was, essentially, an inferior\nversion of mateform.\nToday, the storm stretched long, and Eshonai’s arm began to ache from\nholding the shield in place. “Anything?” she asked of her mother.\n“Not yet! I don’t know the proper mindset.”\n“Attune a bold rhythm!” Eshonai said. That was what Venli had told\nthem. “Confidence or Excitement!”\n“I’m trying! I—”\nWhatever else her mother said was lost in the sound of thunder washing\nacross them, vibrating the very stones, making Eshonai’s teeth chatter. Or\nperhaps that was the cold. Normally chill weather didn’t bother her—\nworkform was well suited to it—but the icy rainwater had leaked through\nher oiled coat, sneaking down along her spine.\nShe attuned Resolve, keeping the shield in place. She would protect her\nmother. Jaxlim often complained that Eshonai was unreliable, prone to\nfancy, but that wasn’t true. Her exploration was difficult work. It was\nvaluable work. She wasn’t unreliable or lazy.\nLet her mother see this. Eshonai holding her shield in defiance of the rain\n—in defiance of the Rider of Storms himself. Holding her mother close,\nwarming her. Not weak. Solid. Dependable. Determined.\nThe gemstone in her mother’s hands began to glow brighter. Finally,\nEshonai thought, shifting to give her mother more space to enact the\ntransformation, the recasting of her soul, the ultimate connection between\nlistener and Roshar itself."

Yet she was. Eshonai gasped, the rhythms disrupting\nand vanishing—all but one, an overwhelming sound she’d never heard\nbefore. A stately, steady tone. Not a rhythm. A pure note.\nProud, louder than the thunder. The sound became everything to her as\nher previous spren—a tiny gravitationspren—was ejected from her\ngemheart.\nThe pure tone of Honor pounding in her ears, she dropped the shield—\nwhich flew away into the dark sky. She wasn’t supposed to have been taken,\nbut in the moment she didn’t care. This transformation was wonderful. In it,\na vital piece of the listeners returned to her.\nThey needed more than they had. They needed this.\nThis … this was right. She embraced the change.\nWhile it happened, it seemed to her that all of Roshar paused to sing\nHonor’s long-lost note.\n* * *\nEshonai came to, lying in a puddle of rainwater cloudy with crem. A single\nrainspren undulated beside her, its form rippling and its eye staring straight\nupward toward the clouds, little feet curling and uncurling.\nShe sat up and surveyed her tattered clothing. Her mother had left\nEshonai at some point during the storm, shouting that she needed to get\nunder cover. Eshonai had been too absorbed by the tone and the new\ntransformation to go with her.\nShe held up her hand and found the fingers thick, meaty, with carapace\nas grand as human armor along the back of the hand and up the arm. It\ncovered her entire body, from her feet up to her head. No hairstrands.\nSimply a solid piece of carapace.\nThe change had shredded her shirt and coat, leaving only her skirt—and\nthat had snapped at the waist, so it barely hung on her body. She stood up,\nand even that simple act felt different than it had before. She was propelled\nto her feet by unexpected strength. She stumbled, then gasped, attuning\nAwe.\n“Eshonai!” an unfamiliar voice said.\nShe frowned as a monstrous figure in reddish-orange carapace stepped\nover some rubble from the highstorm. He had tied his wrap on awkwardly,\nplainly having suffered a similar disrobing. She attuned Amusement, though\nit didn’t look silly. It seemed impossible that such a dynamic, muscular\nfigure could ever look silly. She wished there were a rhythm more majestic\nthan Awe. Was that what she looked like too?\n“Eshonai,” the malen said with his deep voice. “Can you believe this? I\nfeel like I could leap up and touch the clouds!”\nShe didn’t recognize the voice … but that pattern of marbled skin was\nfamiliar. And the features, though now covered by a carapace skullcap,\nwere reminiscent of …\n“Thude?” she said, then gasped again. “My voice!”"

There were a good dozen of them. Though Venli\nhad provided around two dozen gemstones, it seemed not all of the\nvolunteers had taken to the new form. Unsurprising. It would take them\ntime and practice to determine the proper mindset.\n“Were you overwhelmed too?” Dianil said, striding over. Her voice was\nas deep as Eshonai’s now, but that curl of black marbling along her brow\nwas distinctive. “I felt an overpowering need to stand in the storm basking\nin the tone.”\n“There are songs of those who first adopted workform,” Eshonai said. “I\nbelieve they mention a similar experience: an outpouring of power, an\namazing tone that belonged purely to Cultivation.”\n“The tones of Roshar,” Thude said, “welcoming us home.”\nThe twelve of them gathered, and though she knew some better than\nothers, there seemed to be an instant … connection between them. A\ncomradery. They took turns jumping, seeing who could get the highest,\nsinging to Joy, as silly as a bunch of children with a new toy. Eshonai hefted\na rock and hurled it, then watched it soar an incredible distance. She even\ndrew a gloryspren—with flowing tails and long wings.\nAs the others selected their own rocks to try beating her throw, she heard\nan incongruous sound. The drums? Yes, those were the battle drums. A raid\nwas happening at the city.\nThe others gathered around her, humming to Confusion. An attack by\none of the other families? Now?\nEshonai wanted to laugh.\n“Are they insane?” Thude asked.\n“They don’t know what we’ve done,” Eshonai said, looking around at\nthe flat expanse of rock outside the city where they’d engaged the\nhighstorm. Many listeners were only now making their way out of the\nsheltered cracks in the ground.\nTheir best warriors, however, would have stayed at the city in the small,\nstrong structures built there. More than one family had claimed a city right\nafter a storm. It was one of the best times to attack, assuming you could\nmuster your numbers quickly enough.\n“This is going to be fun,” Melu said to Excitement.\n“I don’t know if that’s the correct way to think of it,” Eshonai said,\nthough she felt the same eagerness. A desire to charge in. “Though … if we\ncan arrive before the boasts are done…”\nThe others began attuning Amusement or Excitement, grinning. Eshonai\nled the way, ignoring the calls of those leaving the stormshelter. There was\na more urgent matter to attend to.\nAs they approached the city, she could see the rival family mustered\noutside the gateway, lifting spears and making challenges and taunts.

It was how one knew an attack was happening,\nrather than a request for trade or other interaction.\nAs long as the boasts were continuing, the actual battle hadn’t yet begun.\nShe’d participated in several fights for cities during her family’s years\ntrying to claim one, and they’d always been nasty affairs—the worst one\nleaving over a dozen people dead on each side.\nWell, today they’d see about …\nShe stopped, holding up her hand to make the others pause. They did so\n—though a part of Eshonai wondered why she had decided to take charge.\nIt simply felt natural.\nThey’d been approaching a fissure in the wall surrounding the city. That\nwall might once have been grand, but mere hints of its former majesty\nremained. Most of it had worn low, split by large gaps.\nHere, a figure moved in the shadows. It looked ominous, dangerous—but\nthen Venli emerged into the light, waving them forward. How had she\ngotten to the city so quickly?\nEshonai approached, and Venli looked her up and down with a slow,\ndeliberate gaze. The drums beat in the background, urging Eshonai forward.\nYet that look in her sister’s eyes …\n“So it worked,” Venli said. “Praise the ancient storms for that. You look\ngood, sister. All bulked up and ready to serve.”\n“This isn’t who I am,” Eshonai said, gesturing to the form. “But there is\na certain … thrill to holding it.”\n“Go visit Sharefel,” Venli said. “He’s waiting for you.”\n“The drums…” Eshonai said.\n“The enemy will continue howling insults for a little while yet,” Venli\nsaid. “Visit Sharefel.”\nSharefel. The family’s Shardbearer. Upon obtaining this city, by tradition\nthe defeated family had given up the city’s Shards for her family to protect\nand keep.\n“Venli,” Eshonai said. “We do not use Shards upon other listeners. Those\nare for hunts alone.”\n“Oh, sister,” Venli said to Amusement, walking around her, then\ninspecting Thude and the others. “If we’re going to ever stand a hope of\nresisting the humans—when they inevitably turn against us—we must be\nready to bear the weapons with which we were blessed.”\nEshonai wanted to attune Reprimand at the suggestion, but she\nremembered the things Dalinar Kholin had said to her. If the listeners\nweren’t unified, they would be easy pickings.\n“I want to get to the fight,” Melu said to Excitement, an\nanticipationspren—like a long streamer connected to a round sphere below\n—bouncing around behind her.\n“I think it’s worth trying not to kill anyone,” Thude said to\nConsideration. “With this form … I feel it would be unfair.”\n“Bear the Shards,” Venli urged. “Show them the dangers of approaching\nus to demand battle.”\nEshonai pushed past her sister, and the others followed.

Eshonai didn’t intend to use the Shards against her\npeople, but perhaps there was a purpose to visiting Sharefel. She wound\nthrough the city, passing crem-filled puddles and vines stretching out from\nrockbuds to lap up the moisture.\nThe Shardbearer’s hut was by the front wall, near the drums. It was one\nof the strongest structures in the city, one they always kept well-maintained.\nToday the door was open, welcoming. Eshonai stepped into the doorway.\n“Ah…” a soft voice said to the Rhythm of the Lost. “So it is true. We\nhave warriors once more.”\nEshonai stepped forward, finding the elderly listener sitting in his seat,\nlight from the doorway illuminating his pattern of mostly black skin.\nFeeling it appropriate, even if she didn’t quite know why, she knelt before\nhim.\n“I have long sung the old songs,” Sharefel said, “dreaming of this day. I\nalways thought I would be the one to find it. How? What spren?”\n“Painspren,” Eshonai said.\n“They flee during storms.”\n“We captured them,” Eshonai said as a couple of others entered the\nchamber, striking dangerous silhouettes. “Using a human method.”\n“Ahh…” he said. “I shall try it myself then, at the next storm. But this is\na new era, and deserves a new Shardbearer. Which of you will take my\nShards? Which of you can bear this burden, and this glory?”\nThe group became still. Not all families had Shardbearers; there were\nonly eight sets among all the listeners. Those who held the proper eight\ncities were blessed with them, to be wielded only in hunts against\ngreatshells. Those were rare events, where many families would band\ntogether to harvest a gemheart for growing crops, then feast upon the slain\nbeast.\nThat … did not seem the future of their Shards anymore. If the humans\ndiscover we have these, Eshonai thought, it will be war.\n“Give the Shards to me,” Melu said to Excitement. She stepped forward,\nthough Thude put his hand upon her breastplate as if to restrain her. She\nhummed to Betrayal, and he hummed to Irritation. A challenge from both.\nThis could get ugly very quickly.\n“No!” Eshonai said. “No, none of us will take them. None of us are\nready.” She looked to the elderly Shardbearer. “You keep them. With Plate,\nyou are as firm as any warrior, Sharefel. I merely ask that you stand with us\ntoday.”\nThe drums stopped sounding.\n“I will not lift the Blade against other listeners,” Sharefel said to\nSkepticism.\n“You will not need to,” Eshonai said. “Our goal today will not be to win\na battle, but to promise a new beginning.”\n* * *\nA short time later, they stepped out of the city.

Her family’s warriors would step forward and throw their spears, and\nthe other family would dodge. Then the attacking family would return\nspears. If someone was hit, one side might withdraw and give up the battle.\nIf not, eventually one side might rush the other.\nSpren of all varieties had been drawn to the event, and spun or hovered\naround the perimeters. Eshonai’s family’s archers hung back, their numbers\na show of strength, though they wouldn’t use their weapons here. Bows\nwere too deadly—and too accurate—to be used in harming others.\nThere … had been times, unfortunately, when in the heat of fighting,\ntraditions had been broken. Normal battles had become horrific massacres.\nEshonai had never been part of one of those, but she’d seen the aftereffects\nduring her childhood, when passing a failed assault on another city.\nToday, both sides stopped as the warforms emerged—accompanied by a\nfull Shardbearer in glistening Plate. Eshonai’s family parted, humming to\nAwe or Excitement.\nEshonai picked up a spear, as did several of the others. They came to a\nhalt in the center of the field. The opposing family scrambled back, their\nwarriors brandishing spears. Their postures—and the few sounds of\nhumming Eshonai could make out—were terrified.\n“We have found warform,” Eshonai shouted to Joy. An inviting rhythm,\nnot an angry one. “Come, join us. Enter our city, live with us. We will share\nour knowledge with you.”\nThe others shied away further. One of them shouted, to Reprimand,\n“You’ll consume us! Make us slaves. We won’t be our own family any\nlonger.”\n“We are all one family!” Eshonai said. “You fear being made slaves? Did\nyou see the poor slaveforms the humans had? Did you see the armor of the\nhumans, their weapons? Did you see the fineness of their clothing, the\nwagons they created?\n“You cannot fight that. I cannot fight that. But together, we could fight\nthat. There are tens of thousands of listeners around the Plains. When the\nhumans return, let us show them a united nation, not a bunch of squabbling\ntribes.” She gestured to the other warforms, then let her gaze linger on\nSharefel in his Shardplate.\n“We won’t fight you today,” Eshonai said, turning back to the enemy\nfamily. “None of this family will fight you today. But if any of you persist,\nyou will personally discover the true might of this form. We are going to\napproach the Living-Songs family next. You may choose to be the first to\njoin with our new nation, and be recognized for your wisdom for\ngenerations. Or you can be left until the end, to come groveling for\nmembership, once our union is nearly complete.”\nShe hefted her spear and threw it—shocking herself with the power\nbehind that throw. It soared over the enemy family and disappeared far into\nthe distance. She heard more than one of them humming to the Rhythm of\nthe Terrors."

They wanted a battle to test their abilities. She’d\nnever known listeners to be bloodthirsty, and she didn’t feel this form had\nchanged her that much—but she did admit she felt a certain eagerness.\n“We should train,” she said to the others. “Work out some of our\naggression.”\n“That sounds wonderful,” Thude said.\n“As long as we can do it in front of everyone else,” Melu said to\nIrritation. “I’d like them to understand how easily I could have cracked their\nskulls.” She looked to Eshonai. “But … that was well done. I guess I’m\nglad I didn’t have to rip anyone apart.”\n“How did you learn to give speeches?” one of the others asked from\nbehind. “Did you learn that talking to those trees, out in the wilderness?”\n“I’m not a hermit, Dolimid,” she said to Irritation. “I just like the idea of\nbeing free. Of not being locked into one location. As long as we don’t know\nwhat is out there, we’re likely to be surprised.

We could have been preparing to face the humans for\ngenerations, if we hadn’t been so afraid.”\nThe others hummed to Consolation, understanding. Why had Eshonai\nhad so much trouble persuading people before? Was her present ease\nbecause of the connection she felt with these listeners, the first warforms?\nThere was so much to learn from this form, so much to experiment with.\nShe felt a spring in her step. Perhaps this would be a better form for\nexploration—she could leap obstacles, run faster. There was so much\npossibility.\nThey entered the city, her family’s warriors—those who had been\nthrowing their spears outside—trotting in with them, immediately accepting\nthe authority of the warforms. As they passed Sharefel’s hut, she saw Venli\nagain, lurking in the shadows. This was her victory, after a fashion.\nEshonai probably should have gone to congratulate her, but couldn’t\nbring herself to do it. Venli didn’t need more songs praising her. She already\nhad a big enough ego.\nInstead, Eshonai led the group to the stormshelter, where the rest of their\nfamily was emerging.

She’d forced the enemy to\ndrag it in from the hallway outside, then place it on top of her desk.\nShe wasn’t certain if this would save her from a potential explosion, but\nsince the box didn’t have a top, the force of the destruction should go\nupward—and as long as she stayed low and watched through the window, it\nshould shield her.\nIt was the best she could do in these difficult circumstances. She told the\nsingers she was taking normal precautions, and tried not to indicate to them\nthat she expected an explosion. And indeed she didn’t—the sphere that had\nkilled her scholars had not been Voidlight, but something else. Something\nNavani didn’t yet understand. She was convinced that mixing Voidlight and\nStormlight wouldn’t create an explosion, but a new kind of Light. Like\nTowerlight.\nShe began this next experiment the same way as the previous one,\ndrawing out Stormlight and sending it toward another diamond. Then she\nreached into the box with tongs and placed a Voidlight diamond in the\ncenter of the flow, between the Stormlight diamond and the tuning fork.\nThe Stormlight didn’t react to the Voidlight diamond at all. It simply\nstreamed around the dark gemstone and continued to the vessel diamond.\nAs the tuning fork’s tone quieted, the stream weakened. When the fork fell\nsilent, the Stormlight hanging in the air between the two diamonds puffed\naway and vanished.\nWell, she hadn’t expected that to do anything. Now for a better test.\nShe’d spent several days working under a singular hypothesis: that if\nStormlight reacted to a tone, Voidlight and Towerlight would as well. She’d\nneeded to take a crash course in music theory to properly test the idea.\nThe Alethi traditionally used a ten-note scale—though it was more\naccurately two five-note quintaves. This was right and orderly, and the\ngreatest and most famous compositions were all in this scale. However, it\nwasn’t the only scale in use around the world. There were dozens. The\nThaylens, for example, preferred a twelve-note scale. A strange number, but\nthe twelve steps were mathematically pleasing.\nIn researching the tone the tuning fork created, she’d discovered\nsomething incredible. Anciently, people had used a three-note scale, and a\nfew of the compositions remained. The tone that drew Stormlight was the\nfirst of the three notes from this ancient scale. With some effort—it had\nrequired sending Fused to Kholinar through the Oathgate to raid the royal\nmusic conservatory—she’d obtained tuning forks for the other two notes in\nthis scale. To her delight, Voidlight responded to the third of the three notes.\nShe hadn’t been able to find any indication in her reading that people had"

To her delight, Voidlight responded to the third of the three notes.\nShe hadn’t been able to find any indication in her reading that people had\nonce known these three notes correlated to the three ancient gods. No Alethi\nscholars seemed to know that one of these tones could prompt a reaction in\nStormlight, though Raboniel had—upon questioning—said she’d known.\nIndeed, she’d been surprised to learn that Navani had only recently\ndiscovered the “pure tones of Roshar,” as she called them.\nNavani had tried singing the proper tones, but hadn’t been able to make\nthe light respond. Perhaps she couldn’t match the pitch well enough,\nbecause Raboniel had been able to do it—singing and touching one\ngemstone, then moving her finger to another while holding the note. The\nStormlight had followed her finger just as it did a tuning fork.\nToday Raboniel was off tending to other tasks, but Navani could use the\ntuning forks to replicate her singing ability. Three tones: a note for Honor, a\nnote for Odium, and a note for Cultivation. Yet Vorinism only worshipped\nthe Almighty. Honor.\nTheology would have to wait for another time. For now, she set up her\nnext experiment. She created streams of Stormlight and Voidlight—drawing\neach out from a diamond in a corner of her box—and crossed the streams at\nthe center. The two lights pushed upon one another and swirled as they met,\nbut then separated and streamed to their separate forks.\n“All right,” Navani said, writing in her notebook. “What about this?”\nShe picked up the partially empty Voidlight diamond and then brought out a\nfresh Stormlight diamond, fully infused.\nIn fabrial science, you captured a spren by creating a gemstone with a\nkind of vacuum in it—you drew out the Stormlight, leaving a sphere with a\nvoid or suction inside. It would then pull in a nearby spren, which was\nmade of Light. It was like any pressure differential.\nShe hoped to be able to refill the Voidlight sphere with Stormlight, now\nthat a portion of the Voidlight had been removed. She hit the tuning fork,\nstarted the Stormlight streaming out of its diamond, then tried to get it to go\ninto the Voidlight diamond by making it vibrate to the fork’s tone.\nUnfortunately, when she touched the tuning fork to the Voidlight\ndiamond, it immediately stopped vibrating and the tone died. Extinguished\nlike a candle doused with water. She was able to get the Stormlight to bunch\nup against the Voidlight diamond, by putting the fork next to it, but when\nshe got the Voidlight to stream out toward the side of the table—\ntheoretically creating an active pressure differential in that diamond—she\ncouldn’t get it to suck Stormlight in. Only once all of the Voidlight was out\ncould she infuse the diamond with Stormlight.\n“Like oil and water indeed,” she said, making notes. Yet the way the\nstreams didn’t repel one another when touching felt like proof they weren’t\nopposites.\nShe rose and—after noting the results of this experiment—went to talk\nto the Sibling. Navani could easily fool the guards into thinking she was\nsimply strolling among the bookshelves to read a passage or two, as she"

Today, she began picking through the books on the back shelf\nwhile resting her hand on the Sibling’s vein in the wall.\n“Are we being watched?” Navani asked.\nI’ve told you, the Sibling said. Voidspren can’t be invisible in the tower.\nThat protection is different from the one suppressing enemy Surgebinders,\nand Raboniel hasn’t corrupted it yet.\n“You also told me you could sense if a Voidspren was near.”\nYes.\n“So … are any near?”\nNo, the Sibling said. You do not trust my word?\n“Let’s just call it a healthy paranoia on my part,” Navani said. “Tell me\nagain of—”\nYou continue to experiment with fabrials, the Sibling interrupted. We\nneed to talk more about that. I do not like what you’ve been doing.\n“I haven’t captured any more spren,” Navani whispered. “I’ve been\nworking with Stormlight and Voidlight.”\nDangerous work. The man who forges weapons can claim he’s never\nkilled, but he still prepares for the slaughter.\n“If we’re going to restore your abilities, I need to understand how Light\nworks. So unless you have a better idea for me to do this, I’m going to have\nto continue to use gemstones and—yes—fabrials.”\nThe Sibling fell silent.\n“Tell me again about Towerlight,” Navani said.\nThis is growing tedious.\n“Do you want to be saved, or not?”\n… Fine. Towerlight is my Light, the Light I could create.\n“Did you need a Bondsmith to make it?”\nNo. I could make it on my own. And my Bondsmith could create it,\nthrough their bond with me.\n“And that Light, in turn, powered the tower’s defenses.”\nNot only the defenses. Everything.\n“Why does it no longer work?”\nI already explained that!\n“This is a common investigative method,” Navani said calmly, flipping\nthrough her book with her left hand. “My goal is to make you restate facts\nin different ways, leading you to explain things differently—or to remember\ndetails you forgot.”\nI haven’t forgotten anything. The defenses no longer work because I\ndon’t have the Light for them. I lost most of my strength when I lost the\nability to hear the two pure tones of Roshar. I can make only a tiny amount\nof Light, enough to power a few of the tower’s basic fabrials.\n“Two tones of Roshar?” Navani said. “There are three.”\nNo, there are two. One from my mother, one from my father. The tone of\nOdium is an interloper. False.\n“Could part of the reason you lost your abilities relate to that tone\nbecoming a pure tone of Roshar? Odium truly becoming one of the three\ngods?”\nI … don’t know, the Sibling admitted.\nNavani noted this hypothesis.\nWe need to find a way to restore my Towerlight, the Sibling said, and\nremove the Voidlight from my system.\n“And that,” Navani said, “is exactly what I’m working on.” If she could"

What kind of emulsifier\ncould “stick” to Stormlight and make it mix with Voidlight? She shook her\nhead, taking her hand off the vein on the wall. She’d been here too long, so\nshe took a book and strolled to the front of the room, lost in thought.\nHowever, as she reached her desk, she found a small box waiting for her.\nShe glanced at the guard by the door, who nodded. Raboniel had sent it.\nNavani opened the box, breathless, and found a brightly glowing diamond.\nAt first glance, it seemed to be another Stormlight sphere. But as she held it\nup and placed it next to a true one, she could see the green tinge to the one\nRaboniel had sent.\nLifelight. She’d promised to get some for Navani.\n“Did she say how she acquired this?” Navani asked.\nThe guard shook his head.\nNavani had a guess. The Sibling had lost sight of Lift, but had explained\nsomething was odd about that girl. Something Navani held as a hope that\nmight get them out of this.\nHands steady—though anticipationspren shot up around her—Navani\nused the middle tuning fork on this new diamond. And it worked: she was\nable to draw Lifelight out and send it streaming into a gemstone.\nTowerlight was Lifelight and Stormlight combined. So perhaps Lifelight\n—the Light of Cultivation—had some property that allowed it to mix with\nother Lights. Holding her breath, Navani repeated her earlier experiments,\nexcept with Lifelight instead of Voidlight.\nShe failed.\nShe couldn’t get Stormlight and Lifelight to mix. No use of tuning forks,\nno touching of the streams or clever use of gemstone differentials, worked.\nShe tried mixing Voidlight and Lifelight. She tried mixing all three. She\ntried every experiment she’d listed in her brainstorming sessions earlier.\nThen she did them all again, until—because each experiment allowed a\nlittle Lifelight to vanish into the air—she’d used it all up.\nShooing away exhaustionspren, she stood, frustrated. Another dead end.\nThis was as bad as the morning’s experiments, when she’d tried everything\nshe could think of—including using two tuning forks at once—to make\nTowerlight move from its gemstone. She’d failed at that as well.\nShe gathered all the used diamonds and deposited them by the door\nguard to be picked up and reinfused—there was a highstorm coming today.\nAfter that, she paced, frustrated. She knew she shouldn’t let the lack of\nresults bother her. Real scientists understood that experiments like this\nweren’t failures; they were necessary steps on the way to discovery. In fact,\nit would have been remarkable—and completely unconventional—to find a\ngood result so early in the process.\nThe problem was, scientists didn’t have to work under such terrible\ndeadlines or pressures.

She was isolated, each moment ticking them closer\nto disaster. The only lead she had was in trying to mix the Lights, in the\nhope that she could eventually create more Towerlight to help the Sibling.\nShe wandered the room, pretending to inspect the spines of books on the\nshelves. If I make my discovery, Raboniel will know, since a guard is always\nwatching. She’ll force the answer out of me, and so even in these attempts\nto escape, I’m furthering her goals—whatever those are.\nNavani was on the cusp of something important. The revelations she’d\nbeen given about Stormlight fundamentally changed their understanding of\nit and the world at large. Three types of power. The possibility they could\nbe blended. And … possibly something else, judging by that strange sphere\nthat warped the air around it.\nHer instincts said that this knowledge would come out eventually. And\nthe ones who controlled it, exploited it, would be the ones who won the war.\nI need another plan, she decided. If she did discover how to make\nTowerlight, and if the shield did fall, Navani needed a way to isolate the\ncrystal pillar for a short time. To defend it, perhaps to work on it.\nNavani gripped her notebook in her safehand, to appear as if she were\nwriting down the titles of books. Instead she quickly took notes on an idea.\nShe’d been told she could have anything she needed, so long as it was\nrelevant to her experiments. They also let her store equipment out in the\nhallway.\nSo, what if she created some fabrial weapons, then stored them in the\nhallway? Innocent-looking fabrials that, once activated, could be used to\nimmobilize guards or Fused coming to stop her from working on the pillar?\nShe sketched out some ideas: traps she could create using seemingly\ninnocent fabrial parts. Painrials to administer agony and cause the muscles\nto lock up. Heating fabrials to burn and scald.\nYes … she could create a series of defenses in the form of failed\nexperiments, then store them “haphazardly” in crates along the hallway. She\ncould even arm them by using Voidspren gems, as she could demand those\nfor use in her experiments.\nThese plans soothed her; this was something meaningful she could do.\nHowever, the experiments, and their potential, still itched at her. What was\nRaboniel’s true goal? Was it to make a weapon herself—like the one that\nhad destroyed the room and Navani’s two scientists?\nA few hours had passed, so it wouldn’t look strange if she went to the\nback of the stacks again. She picked up a book and settled down in a chair\nshe’d placed nearby. Although she wasn’t directly visible to the guard, she\npretended to read as she reached her hand to the wall and touched the vein.\n“Any spren nearby?” Navani asked.\nI cannot feel any, the Sibling said with a resigned tone.\n“Good. Tell me, do you know anything of the explosion that happened\non the day of the invasion? It involved two of my scientists in a room on the\nfifth floor.”"

        "text": "“Good. Tell me, do you know anything of the explosion that happened\non the day of the invasion? It involved two of my scientists in a room on the\nfifth floor.”\nI felt it. But I do not know what caused it.\n“Have you ever heard of a sphere, or a Light, that warps the air around\nit? One that appears to be Voidlight unless you look at it long enough to\nnotice the warping effect?”\nNo, the Sibling said. I’ve never heard or seen anything like that—though\nit sounds dangerous.\nNavani considered, tapping her finger against the wall. “I haven’t been\nable to get any of the Lights to mix. Do you know of any potential binding\nagent that could make them stick together? Do you know how Towerlight is\nmixed from Stormlight and Lifelight?”\nThey don’t mix, the Sibling said. They come together, as one. Like I am a\nproduct of my mother and father, so Towerlight is a product of me. And stop\nasking me the same questions. I don’t care about your “investigative\nmethods.” I’ve told you what I know. Stop making me repeat myself.\nNavani took a deep breath, calming herself with effort. “Fine. Have you\nbeen able to eavesdrop on Raboniel at all?”\nNot much. I can only hear things near a few people that are relevant. I\ncan see the Windrunner. I think the Edgedancer has been surrounded by\nralkalest, which is why she’s invisible. Also, I can see one particular Regal.\n“Any ideas on why that is?”\nNo. Regals weren’t often in the tower in the past, and never this variety.\nShe can speak all languages; perhaps this is why I can see near her. Though\nshe vanishes sometimes, so I cannot see all she does. I can also see near the\ncrystal pillar, but with the field set up, I hear mere echoes of what is\nhappening outside.\n“Tell me those, then.”\nIt’s nothing relevant. Raboniel is trying her own experiments with the\nLight—and she hasn’t gotten as far as you have. This seems to frustrate her.\nCurious. That did a little for Navani’s self-esteem. “She really wants this\nhybrid Light. I wonder … maybe fabrials made with a hybrid Stormlight-\nVoidlight would work in the tower, even if the protections were turned\nagainst her again. Maybe that is why she wants it.”\nYou are foolish to presume to know what one of the Fused wants. She is\nthousands of years old. You can’t outthink her.\n“You’d better hope that I can.” Navani flipped a few pages in her\nnotebook. “I’ve been thinking of other ways out of this. What if we found\nyou someone to bond, to make them Radiant? We could—”\nNo. Never again.\n“Hear me out,” Navani said. “You’ve said you’ll never bond a human\nagain, because of the things we do to spren. But what about a singer? Could\nyou theoretically bond one of them?”\nWe are talking of resisting them, and now you suggest I bond one? That\nseems insane.\n“Maybe not,” Navani said. “There’s a Parshendi in Bridge Four. I’ve met"

Not someone who has\never created a fabrial—someone who knows the rhythms of Roshar.”\nThe Sibling was silent, and Navani wondered if the conversation was\nover. “Sibling?” she asked.\nI had not considered this, they said. A singer who does not serve Odium?\nI will need to think. It would certainly surprise Raboniel, who thinks that I\nam dead or sleeping.\nIn any case, I cannot form a bond now, with the protections up. I would\nneed him to touch my pillar.\n“What if I had him here?” Navani said. “Ready to try when the shield\nfalls? And with some distractions in place to give you time to talk to him.”\nI cannot form a bond with just anyone, the Sibling said. In the past I\nspent years evaluating Bondsmith squires to select one who fit me exactly.\nEven they eventually betrayed me, though not as badly as other humans.\n“Can we really afford pickiness right now?”\nIt’s not pickiness. It is the nature of spren and the bond. The person must\nbe willing to swear the correct oaths, to unite instead of divide. They must\nmean it, and the oaths must be accepted. It is not simply a matter of\nthrowing the first person you find at me.\nBeyond that, since I cannot create Towerlight, they will not be able to\neither. A bond would do nothing unless we solve the problems with my\npowers. It would be better if you focused on that problem instead.\n“Fine,” Navani said, sensing an opening. “But I need time to research all\nof this. It is difficult to work while feeling I have a knife to my neck. If I\nknew the nodes were being defended, that would take the pressure off me.\nTell me where one of them is. I have a list here of plans to protect it. I can\nread them off to you.”\nThe Sibling was silent, so Navani continued.\n“We can have Kaladin start searching—loudly and obviously—on a\ndifferent level, leading the enemy on a chase in the wrong direction. In the\nmeantime, while they’re distracted, we could sneak up to the node and\nreinforce its defenses.\n“We have some crem that hasn’t hardened yet, kept wet in the tower\nstores. We could seal up the node location entirely. Maybe run the crem\nthrough with some training sheaths for Shardblades, so it would be extra\ndifficult to cut. That could earn us hours to get troops in to defend it, if it\ndoes get discovered.\n“Or, if I knew where one of the nodes was, I might be able to have\nKaladin begin infusing it with more Stormlight. That might counteract the\nVoidlight that Raboniel has used on you. If she can corrupt you through a\nnode, could we not perhaps cleanse you through one?

Her other ideas were sketchier than\nthose. She wouldn’t use them unless these arguments didn’t work.\nSo good with words. Humans are like persuasionspren. I can’t speak with\none of you without being changed.\nNavani continued to wait. Silence was best now.\nFine, the Sibling said. One of the two remaining nodes is in the well at\nthe center of the place you call the Breakaway market. It is near other\nfabrials there. One hidden among many.\n“On the first floor?” Navani asked. “That’s such a populated area!”\nAll of the nodes are down low. There was talk of installing others farther\naway, but my Bondsmith did not have the resources—my falling-out with the\nhumans was driving them away. The project wasn’t completed. Only the\nfour on the first few floors were completed.\nNavani frowned—though the well was a clever place to hide a fabrial.\nMany of the workings of the tower remained mysterious to modern\nscholars, so a cluster of gemstones working as pumps might indeed\ncamouflage another fabrial. In fact, Navani had studied drawings of those\npumps herself. Had this mechanism been there, unnoticed, all along?\nThis is a good node for your agent to visit, the Sibling said. Because it\ncan be reached from the back ways. Have your Windrunner visit it through\nthe aquifers, and we will see if—by infusing it with Stormlight—he can\ncounteract the corruption. It might not work, as I am not simply of Honor\nor of Cultivation. But … it could help.\n“And the final node?” Navani asked.\nIs mine alone, the Sibling replied. Show me that your work on this one\nhelps, human, and then we can speak further.\n“A fair compromise,” Navani said. “I am willing to listen, Sibling.”\nShe left the wall and grabbed some books to read, to cover what she’d\nbeen doing. And she did need to study more, after all. She’d have loved to\nhave more books on music theory, but this archive didn’t have anything\nmore specific on the topic. She did have Kalami’s notes about the\ngemstones they’d discovered that used certain buzzing vibrations as\nsubstitutes for letters. Perhaps those would help.\nShe was browsing through those notes, walking idly among the stacks,\nwhen she saw the Sibling’s light flashing. She hurried over, nervous about\nhow bright the light was. She glanced at the guard, hoping he hadn’t seen,\nand put her hand to the wall.\n“You need to—”\nThey’ve found the node in the well. We’re too late.\n“What? Already?”\nI am as good as dead.\n“Contact Kaladin.”\nThey already have the node, and he’s too far away. We—\n“Contact Kaladin,” Navani said. “Now. I’ll find a way to distract\nRaboniel.”\nOpposites.

Screams from the nightmare echoed\nin his head, but he didn’t have time for weakness. He had to stop the\ncorruption of that gemstone—and barring that, he had to destroy the node.\nThat was the only way to buy Navani the time she needed.\nHe had to get there quickly, which meant he couldn’t use the stairs. He’d\nhave to go straight down through the atrium.\n* * *\n“I need to see the Lady of Wishes immediately!” Navani proclaimed to the\nguard. “I’ve made a discovery of incalculable value! It cannot wait for—”\nThe guard—a Regal stormform—simply started walking and gestured\nfor her to follow. He didn’t even need the full explanation.\n“Excellent,” Navani said, joining him in the hallway. “I’m glad you see\nthe urgency.”\nThe guard walked her to the large stairwell that led up to the ground\nfloor. A Deepest One stood here, her fingers laced before her. “What is it?”\nshe asked in heavily accented Alethi. “A sudden illness?”\n“No,” Navani said, taken aback. “A discovery. I think I’ve found what\nthe Lady of Wishes was searching for.”\n“But of course you can’t share it with anyone but Raboniel herself,” the\nFused said, a faintly amused rhythm to her voice.\n“Well, I mean…” Navani trailed off.\n“I’ll see if I can reach her via spanreed,” the Fused said. “I’ll tell her it is\nmost urgent.”\nStorms. They were expecting an attempted distraction from Navani. That\nthought was reinforced as the Fused glided to a cabinet that had been set up\nby the wall.

But how had they known that she would know that …\nShe stepped back, her eyes widening as the terrible implications struck\nher. Kaladin was in serious danger.\n* * *\nBarefoot and armed with a spear, Kaladin burst out onto the walkway\naround the atrium, then hurled himself out into the open space eleven\nstories in the air. Full of Stormlight—hoping it would save him in case this\ndidn’t work—he pointed his hand directly beneath him and engaged\nNavani’s fabrial.\nAs soon as it was activated, he lurched to a halt in the air, hovering—his\nmuscles straining as he was basically doing a handstand with one hand. But\nas long as the counterweight in the distant shaft was held motionless,\nKaladin would be as well.\nHe gripped the bar across his left hand and began to fall downward,\nalmost as if he were Lashed. In fact, he was counting on it seeming like\nnothing was wrong with his powers—that he was a full Windrunner ready\nfor battle. He wouldn’t be able to keep up such a facade for long, but\nperhaps it would gain him an advantage.\nHis descent—at a speed a notch below insane—gave him a view out the\nenormous atrium window, running all the way up the wall to his right.\nStrangely, it was dark outside, though Syl had said it was midday. He didn’t\nhave to ask for clarification, as a flash of lightning bespoke the truth. A\nhighstorm. He still found it incredible that he could be so deep within a\ntower that one could be going on without him realizing it. Even in the best\nstormshelters, you usually felt the rumbles of thunder or the anger of the\nwind.\nHis fall certainly drew attention. Heavenly Ones dressed in long robes\nturned from their midair meditations. Shouts rose from Regals or singers\nalong the various levels. He wasn’t certain if Leshwi was among them or\nnot, as he passed too quickly.\nUsing the fabrial, he slowed himself before he hit the ground, then\ndeactivated the device entirely and fell the last five feet or so. Stormlight\nabsorbed that drop, and he startled dozens of people—many of them human\n—who hadn’t heard the disturbance above. Commerce was now allowed\nand encouraged by the Fused, and the atrium floor had become a secondary\nmarket—though a more transient one than the Breakaway a short distance\noff. That was where he would find the well.\nKaladin’s luminescence would be starkly visible against the dark\nwindow, lit in flashes. The shouts of alarm above were swallowed in the\nvoluminous atrium as Kaladin oriented himself, then ran for a stack of\ncrates. He took a few steps up them to launch into the air some ten feet\nhigh, then he pointed his left hand and engaged Navani’s device.\nHe flew like a Windrunner, his body upright, left arm held at chest\nheight, elbow bent. It might look like he was using Lashings. Though\nWindrunners sometimes dove and flew headfirst like they were swimming,\njust as often they would fly “standing” up straight—like he did now."

Syl zipped along beside him, imitating a stormcloud. People\ncried out, surprised—but also excited—and Kaladin worried about what he\nwas showing them. He didn’t want to inspire a revolt that would get\nhundreds killed.\nThe best he could hope for was to get in, destroy the fabrial, and get out\nalive. That goal whispered of a much larger problem. Navani had said there\nwere four nodes. Today, he’d try to destroy the third. At this rate, the last\none would fall in a few days, and then what?\nHe pushed that thought out of his mind as he flew along the top of a\ncorridor, inches from the textured stone ceiling. He didn’t have time for\nsecond-guessing, or for dwelling on the crippling darkness and anxiety that\ncontinued to scratch at his mind. He had to ignore that, then deal with the\neffects later. Exactly as he’d been doing far too long now.\n“Watch for an ambush,” he told Syl as they burst from the corridor and\ninto the Breakaway market. This large room, truly cavernous, was four\nstories high and packed with shops along the ground. Many were along\nroadways that Navani—reluctantly adapting to the will of the people—had\nlaid out in the way they wanted. Other parts were snarls of tents and\nsemipermanent wooden structures.\nCentral to the layout was the enormous well. Kaladin wasn’t high\nenough to see over the buildings and make it out, but he knew the location.\nThe Edgedancer clinic was nearby, though it was now staffed by ordinary\nsurgeons. He hoped his parents and little brother had made it safely there,\nwhere the other surgeons would hide them. They’d checked a few days\nback and found his father’s clinic empty.\nStorms. If he lost his family …\n“The Pursuer!” Syl said. “He was waiting by the other entrance.”\nKaladin reacted just in time, deactivating the fabrial and dropping to the\nground, where he tucked and rolled. The relentless Fused appeared from his\nribbon of light and dropped to the ground too, but Kaladin rolled to his feet\nout of the creature’s reach.\n“Your death,” the creature growled, crouched among terrified\nmarketgoers, “is growing tedious, Windrunner. How is it you recovered all\nof your Lashings?”\nKaladin launched himself into the air, activating the device and shooting\nupward. It jerked his arm painfully, but he’d grown used to that—and\nStormlight worked to heal the soreness. He’d also practiced his old one-\nhanded spear grips. Hopefully that training would serve him today.\nHe wasn’t nearly as maneuverable with this device as he was with\nLashings. Indeed, as the Pursuer gave chase as a ribbon, Kaladin’s only real\nrecourse was to cut the device and drop past him. Near the ground, Kaladin\npointed his hand to the side and reengaged the device, then went shooting\nout across the crowd in the general direction of the well. Maybe—"

Maybe—\nHe lurched to a stop as the first of the device’s weights bottomed out. A\nheartbeat later the Pursuer slammed into him, grabbing him around the neck\nand hanging on.\n“Kaladin!” Syl shouted. “Heavenly Ones! Over a dozen of them!\nThey’re streaming in through the tunnels.”\n“Good,” Kaladin said with a grunt, dropping his spear and grappling\nagainst the Pursuer with the hand he could move.\n“Good?” she asked.\nHe couldn’t both grapple and twist the dial on his fabrial—the one that\nwould activate the second weight. But he could deactivate the device using\none hand, so he did that, dropping them ten feet to the ground. The Pursuer\nhit first with a grunt. He hung on though, rolling Kaladin to try to pin him.\n“Turn … the dial,” Kaladin said to Syl, using both hands to struggle with\nthe Pursuer.\n“When you die,” the creature said in his ear, “I will find the next Radiant\nyour spren bonds and kill them too. As payment for the trouble you have\ngiven me.”\nSyl zipped down to his left wrist and took the shape of an eel, pushing\nagainst the raised section at the center of the dial. She could turn a page, lift\na leaf. Would she be strong enough to—\nClick.\nKaladin twisted in the Pursuer’s grip, barely managing to press his left\nhand to the creature’s armored chest. Activating the device sent them both\nmoving upward—but slowly. Storms, Kaladin hadn’t thought this through.\nHe’d only be able to lift as much as the counterweight. Apparently he and\nthe Pursuer together were about that heavy.\nFortunately, rather than taking advantage of the slow movement, the\nPursuer paused and glanced at Kaladin’s hand, trying to figure out what was\nhappening. So, as they inched upward, Kaladin was able to rip his right\nhand free. He reached for the scalpel he’d affixed in a makeshift sheath at\nhis belt, then brought it up and rammed it into the Pursuer’s wrist, slicing\nthe tendons there.\nThe creature immediately let go, vanishing, leaving a husk behind. Once\nthat dropped off of Kaladin, he immediately went darting up into the sky,\npulled by his hand in an awkward motion that nearly ripped his arm from its\nsocket.\n“This … isn’t that effective, is it?” Syl asked.\n“No,” Kaladin said, slowing himself by relaxing his grip. He went to\ndraw in more Stormlight, but realized he still had plenty raging in his veins.\nThat was one advantage of the fabrial; he didn’t use up Light nearly as\nquickly.\nThe Heavenly Ones circled him in the air, but kept their distance.\nKaladin searched for the Pursuer—the creature had used two bodies. He\nhad a third one to waste before the fight became dangerous for him, so he\nwouldn’t retreat yet.\nThere, Kaladin thought, noting the red ribbon weaving between\nHeavenly Ones.

The Pursuer was trying to delay Kaladin; each\nmoment wasted was another one that might lead to the Sibling being\ncorrupted.\nBelow, the market streets were quickly emptying of people. Kaladin’s\nfears about them revolting weren’t being realized, fortunately—but he\ncouldn’t spend forever in a standoff with the Pursuer. So he disengaged the\ndevice and started falling.\nThis finally made the Pursuer dart for him, and Kaladin quickly\nreengaged the device—lurching to a halt. He twisted—though he couldn’t\nmove his left arm—and prepared his knife. This sudden motion made the\nPursuer back off, however. Could the creature … be afraid? That seemed\nimplausible.\nKaladin didn’t have time to reflect, as he needed to engage the Pursuer a\nthird time for his plan to work. So he turned away, inviting the attack—and\nreceiving it as the Pursuer committed, darting in and forming a body that\ngrabbed for Kaladin. Despite trying to speed away, Kaladin wasn’t quite\nable to evade the creature’s grip.\nKaladin was forced to let the Pursuer grab him around the neck as he\nstabbed the creature in the arm between two plates of carapace, trying to\nsever the tendons. The monster grunted, his arm around Kaladin’s throat.\nThey continued to soar about thirty feet off the ground. Kaladin ignored the\ntight grip and maneuvered the scalpel. Perhaps if he could force the Pursuer\nto waste Voidlight healing …\nYes. Cut enough times to be worried, the Pursuer let go and flew away,\nseeking a place to recover. Panting, Kaladin used the device to drop to the\nground. He landed on an empty street between two tents. People huddled\ninside both, crowding them.\nKaladin forced himself to jog to where he’d dropped his spear. Heavenly\nOnes circled above, preparing to attack. Syl moved up beside him, watching\nthem. Two dozen now. Kaladin searched them, hoping …\nThere. He raised his spear toward Leshwi, who hovered apart from the\nothers, wearing clothing too long for practical battle—even in the air. This\nevent had caught her unaware.\nPlease, he thought. Accept the fight.\nThat was his best hope. He couldn’t fight them all at once; he could\nbarely face the Pursuer. If he wanted any chance of getting to the node, he’d\nneed to fight a single opponent—one who wasn’t as relentless as the\nPursuer.\nHe worried he’d already wasted too much time. But if he could get\nLeshwi to agree to a duel …\nShe raised her spear toward him.\n“Syl,” he said, “go to the well and find the fabrial of the node. It’s\nprobably a sapphire, and should have a glass sphere nearby like the one we\nsaw before.”\n“Right,” she said. “It will probably be underwater. That’s what the\nSibling said. Near the pump mechanisms. Can … can you swim?”\n“Won’t need to, with Stormlight to sustain me and the fabrial to move\nme,” Kaladin said, lifting his hand and rising into the air above the market."

Our best chance to destroy the\nfabrial will be for me to break from this fight and fly straight down to it,\nthen hit the device in one blow before anyone realizes what I’m doing. I’ll\nneed you to guide me.”\n“Sounds good.” She hesitated, looking toward him.\n“I’ll be all right,” he promised.\nShe flew off to do as he requested. He might be too late already. He\ncould feel something changing. A greater oppression, a heaviness, was\nsettling upon him. He could only assume it was the result of the Fused\ncorrupting the Sibling.\nWell, he couldn’t move in that direction until Syl had the way prepared\nfor him, so this would have to do. He leveled out in the air opposite Leshwi,\nhis hand still held upward above him. The pose made him look overly\ndramatic, but he tried to appear confident anyway.\nLeshwi wore the same body as last time, muscular, tall, wrapped in\nflowing black and white clothing. Her lance was shorter than normal,\nperhaps intended for indoor fighting.\nRight. Well, he hoped to give a good showing in this fight, long enough\nto give Syl time to scout for him. So he cut the fabrial and dropped in the\nair, spinning and giving himself a few seconds of free fall. He felt almost\nlike a real Windrunner—which was dangerous, as he almost tried to sculpt\nhis fall with his hands in the wind. Fortunately, he remembered to engage\nthe device as he neared the rooftops.\nHe lurched to a stop with a painful jolt, his arm bent, his elbow held\nclose to his side. He had the most stability this way, his muscles keeping\nhim as if he were standing upright with his left arm tucked in to keep his\ncenter of gravity close and tight.\nHe gripped the device’s bar and his left hand tugged him forward,\nzooming over the roofs of the shops. It made for a pitiful approximation of\na true Windrunner maneuver, but Leshwi dove after him anyway, echoing\ntheir previous contests.\nEyes watering from the pain in his arm, Kaladin dropped to a rooftop\nand spun to raise his spear toward Leshwi, gripping it firmly in his right\nhand—a classic formation grip, with the spear up beside his head. Heal! he\nthought at his arm as Leshwi slowed above, holding her lance in one hand\nand hovering.\nShe was plainly cautious, so Kaladin infused a patch of the rooftop with\na Reverse Lashing, picturing it pulling on tassels of clothing. Leshwi’s\nrobes rippled and were pulled toward Kaladin, but she took a knife from her\nbelt and cut them, dropping her train and much of the excess clothing to\nflutter down to affix itself to the rooftop.\nKaladin raised himself into the air again, wincing at the pain in his\nshoulder.\n“What is wrong, Windrunner?” Leshwi asked in heavily accented Alethi,\ncoming closer. “Your powers fail you.”\n“Fight me anyway,” Kaladin called up at her.

As he did, he caught a\nglimpse of the Pursuer’s bloodred ribbon weaving out of a building below.\nLeshwi followed his gaze and seemed to understand, for she raised her\nlance toward him in an attack posture. Kaladin took a deep breath and\nreturned his spear to the overhand grip, weapon up by his head, his elbow\ncocked. He’d been trained in this grip for shield and spear combat. It was\nbest with a group of friends each with shields up—but what combat wasn’t?\nHe waited for her to get close, then stabbed at her, causing her to dodge\naway. The Pursuer’s ribbon fluttered around nearby, weaving between\nwatching Heavenly Ones.\nLeshwi made a few more token attempts to engage him, and for a\nmoment the fight seemed almost fair. Then Leshwi rose into the air and\npassed overhead, while Kaladin was left to twist—then disengage his\ndevice and drop a few feet before lurching into a hanging position, facing\nher. She cocked her head, then flew to the side and attacked him from that\ndirection.\nHe tried to deflect, but he was too immobile. Her spear bit him in the left\narm, causing him to grunt in pain. Blood spread from the wound, and—as\nbefore—it didn’t heal immediately. In fact, his Stormlight seemed to be\nresponding slower than it had earlier in this fight.\nStorms, this had been a mistake. He couldn’t duel Leshwi like this. He’d\nbe better off on the ground; he’d be outmatched against opponents with the\nhigh ground, but at least he wouldn’t be frozen in place. If Navani ever\nwanted these devices to be useful in aerial combat, she had a lot of work to\ndo.\nSo he fled, engaging the device and sending himself flying between a\ncouple of Heavenly Ones who moved dutifully to the sides to let Leshwi\nfollow. Even the Pursuer seemed to respect the duel, as his ribbon stopped\nfollowing and vanished below.\nAt least that part of Kaladin’s plan had worked. Unfortunately, Leshwi\nhad clearly put together that he couldn’t veer to either side—and that his\nacceleration was limited to a single Lashing, the maximum from one falling\nweight. So while he crossed the vast room in seconds, the moment he\nslowed to prevent himself from hitting the wall, she slammed into him from\nbehind. The force of the hit made him grip the speed-control bar by\naccident, and he was rammed into the wall by his own fist, Leshwi pressing\nhim from behind.\nShe put a knife to his neck. “This is a sham, Stormblessed,” she said in\nhis ear. “This is no contest.”\nHe squeezed his eyes shut, fighting off the pain of the hit and the cut to\nhis arm—though that finally appeared to be healing. Slowly, but at least it\nwas happening.\n“We could drop to the ground,” he said through gritted teeth. “Fight a\nduel without Surges.”\n“Would you actually do that?” Leshwi said. “I think you cannot spare the\ntime. You’re here to interfere with whatever the Lady of Wishes is doing.”"

You’re here to interfere with whatever the Lady of Wishes is doing.”\nKaladin grunted his reply, not wanting to waste Stormlight by speaking.\nLeshwi, however, pulled away in the air, leaving him to turn around\nawkwardly as he’d done before, with a dropping lurch. She drifted down to\neye level with him. Past her, he spotted Syl rising into the air and coming\ntoward him. She made a quick glyph in the air. Ready.\nAs Leshwi started talking, he fixed his attention on her so she wouldn’t\nthink anything was amiss.\n“Surrender,” she said. “If you give your weapon to me now, I might be\nable to get the Lady of Wishes to turn aside the Pursuer. Together we could\nstart to work toward a true government and peace for Roshar.”\n“A true government and peace?” Kaladin demanded. “Your people are in\nthe middle of conquering mine!”\n“And did your leader not conquer his way to the throne?” she asked,\nsounding genuinely confused. “This is the way of your people as well as\nmine. Besides, you must admit my people govern better. The humans under\nour control have not been treated unfairly. Certainly they live better than the\nsingers fared under your domination.”\n“And your god?” Kaladin asked. “You can promise me that once\nhumankind has been subdued, he won’t have us exterminated?”\nLeshwi didn’t respond, though she hummed to a rhythm he couldn’t\ndistinguish.\n“I know the kind of men who follow Odium,” Kaladin said softly. “I’ve\nknown them all my life. I bear their brands on my forehead, Leshwi. I could\nalmost trust you for the honor you’ve shown me—if it didn’t mean trusting\nhim as well.”\nShe nodded, and seemed to accept this as a valid argument. She began\nlowering, perhaps to engage in that fight he’d suggested, without powers.\n“Leshwi,” he called after she had lowered partway. “I feel the need to\npoint out that I didn’t agree to fight you below. I simply noted it was an\noption.”\n“What is the distinction?” she called up.\n“I’d rather you not see this as a broken oath,” he said, then disengaged\nthe fabrial and pointed it right at Syl before launching himself that direction\n—straight over Leshwi’s head.\nHe didn’t wait to see if she gave chase. Syl streaked ahead of him,\nleading him straight across the room toward the blue pool of water at the\ncenter. Guards were there, pushing people into buildings, but the way was\nopen. The other Heavenly Ones kept their distance from him, assuming he\nwas still dueling with Leshwi.\nHe cut the fabrial right as he passed over the well, then pointed his hand\ndown and engaged it. His aim was true, and he sucked in more Stormlight\nas he splashed into the water. It hurt to hit, far more than he’d expected\nfrom something soft like water.

Fortunately,\nhis Stormlight sustained him in the chill depth. It also gave him light to see\na figure below, swimming beside a group of glowing gemstones on the wall,\nsecured here deep beneath the surface.\nThe figure turned toward him, her topknot swirling in the water—lit\nfrom the side by a variety of gemstone hues. It was her, the one who had\nbeen so fascinated with him last time. This time she seemed surprised,\ndrawing a dagger from her belt and swinging it at him.\nHowever, Kaladin found that Navani’s fabrial worked far better in this\nenvironment. He could easily disengage it and swing it in another direction\nwithout dropping or lurching—and the added pull meant he easily\noutmaneuvered this Fused.\nHe spun around her and moved lower in the water. The well’s shaft was\nonly about ten feet wide, so when she pushed off a wall, she could reach\nhim—but behind her, Syl highlighted the correct gemstone.\nHe engaged his own fabrial, which towed him past the Fused, letting her\nget a clean cut across his chest with her dagger. Blood clouded the water,\nbut Kaladin connected his fist against the sapphire, knocking it free. He\nspun his spear in the water and jabbed it at the wires of the fabrial cage,\nthen pried loose the glass sphere. That should do it.\nNow to get out. He looked upward through the red water, and began to\nfeel dizzy. Healing was coming so slowly.\nSyl soared ahead of him as he used the fabrial to rise up, leaving the\nannoyed Fused behind. Syl’s light was encouraging, as it seemed to be\ngetting darker in here.\nMy Stormlight is running out. Storms. How was he going to get away?\nDozens of Fused awaited him above. He … he might have to surrender, as\nLeshwi had insisted. Would they let him, now?\nWhat was that rumbling? He saw light shimmering above, but it was\nshrinking. Syl made it out, but she didn’t seem to have realized he was\nlagging behind her. And the light was vanishing.\nA lid, he realized with panic. They’re putting a lid over the top of the\nwell. As he neared, in the last sliver of light he saw the hulking form of the\nPursuer. Smiling.\nThe lid thumped in place right before Kaladin arrived. He burst into the\nsmall section of air between the top of the well’s water level and the lid,\ngasping for breath.\nBut he was trapped. He slammed against the wood, trying to use the\npower of Navani’s device to lift it—but he heard thumping as weights,\nlikely stones, were set on top of it. More and more of them.\nThe Pursuer had been ready for this. He knew that even if Kaladin’s\ngravitational Lashings worked, enough weight would keep the lid in place.\nIn fact, it felt like the weights were alive. People, dozens of them, climbing\non top of the lid. Of course. Why use stone when humans were heavy\nenough and far easier to move?"

Why use stone when humans were heavy\nenough and far easier to move?\nKaladin pounded on the wood as he felt Syl panicking, unable to reach\nhim. His Stormlight was fading, and it seemed the walls and the lid were\nclosing in on him. He’d die in here, and it wouldn’t take long. All the\nPursuer had to do was wait. They could seal it above, denying him fresh\nair.…\nIn that moment of pure terror, Kaladin was in one of his nightmares\nagain.\nBlackness.\nEncircled by hateful shadows.\nTrapped.\nAnxiety mounted inside him, and he began to thrash in the water,\nscreaming, letting out the rest of his Stormlight. In that moment of panic, he\ndidn’t care. But as he fell hoarse from shouting, he heard—strangely\nenough—Hav’s voice. Kaladin’s old sergeant, from his days as a recruit.\nPanic on the battlefield kills more men than enemy spears. Never run.\nAlways retreat.\nThis water came from somewhere. There was another way out.\nKaladin took a deep breath and dove beneath the black water, feeling it\nsurround him. His panic returned. He didn’t know which way was up and\nwhich was down. How could you forget which way the sky was? But all\nwas blackness. He fished in his pouch, finally managing to think clearly. He\ngot out a glowing gemstone, but it slipped from his fingers.\nAnd sank.\nThat way.\nHe pointed his fist toward the falling light and engaged Navani’s device.\nHe was in no state for delicacy, so he squeezed as tight as he could and\nlurched, towed by his arm farther into the darkness. He plunged past the\nfabrials and the Fused—she was swimming upward, and didn’t seem\nconcerned with him.\nHis ears screamed with a strange pain the deeper he went. He started to\nbreathe in more Stormlight, but stopped himself. Underwater, he risked\ngetting a lungful of liquid. But … he had no idea how to get Light when\nsubmerged. How had they never thought about this?\nIt was good that the device kept pulling him, because he might not have\nhad the presence of mind to keep moving on his own. That was proven as\nhe reached the gemstone he’d dropped, a garnet, and found it sitting on the\nbottom of the tube. A bright sapphire glowed here too, the one he’d knocked\nfree. He grabbed it and disengaged the gauntlet fabrial, but it took him\nprecious seconds to think and search around.\nThe tunnel turned level here.

Nightmares chased him, manifestations of his anxiety, and it\nwas as if the world were crushing him. Everything became blackness once\nmore.\nThe only thing he felt was Syl, so distant now, terrified. He thought that\nwould be his last sensation.\nThen he broke out of the water into the air. He gasped—a raw and primal\naction. A physiological response rather than conscious choice. Indeed, he\nmust have blacked out anyway, for when he blinked and his senses\nreturned, he found himself hanging by his aching arm from the ceiling in a\nreservoir beneath the tower.\nHe shook his head, and looked at his hand. He’d dropped the sapphire,\nand when he tried to breathe in Stormlight, nothing came. His pouch was\nempty of it. He must have fed off it while drifting in and out of\nconsciousness. He was tempted to let himself sleep again.…\nNo! They’ll be coming for you!\nHe forced his eyes open. If the enemy had explored the tower enough to\nknow about this reservoir, they would come looking to be certain he was\ndead.\nHe disengaged the fabrial and dropped into the water. The cold shocked\nhim awake, and he was able to use the fabrial to tug himself to the side of\nthe reservoir. He crawled out onto dry stone. Amusingly, he was enough a\nsurgeon to worry about how he’d contaminated this drinking water. Of all\nthe things to think about right now …\nHe wanted to sleep, but could see blood dripping from his chest and arm,\nthe wounds there not fully healed. So he stumbled to the side of the\nchamber and sucked the Stormlight from the two lamps there. Yes, the\nenemy knew about this place. If he hadn’t been so addled, he’d have put\ntogether earlier that the light meant someone was changing the gemstones.\nHe stumbled, sodden and exhausted, down the hallway. There would be\nan exit. He vaguely remembered news of Navani’s scouts finding this\nreservoir. They’d only known about it by having Thaylen free divers inspect\nthe fabrials in the well.\nKeep thinking. Keep walking. Don’t drift off.\nWhere was Syl? How far was he from her now? He’d traveled quite a\nway in the darkness of that water.\nHe reached steps, but couldn’t force himself to climb them. He just\nstood, numb, staring at them. So he used the fabrial. Slow, easy climbs with\nit tugging him up at one angle, then another. Back and forth. Again and\nagain.\nHe knew he was close when he heard rumbling. The highstorm. It was\nstill blowing, so he hadn’t been in that blackness for an eternity. He let it\ncall to him as he continued half-flying, half-trudging upward.\nFinally he staggered out of a room on the ground floor of the tower. He\nemerged right into the middle of a group of singer troops shouting for\npeople to go to their quarters.\nThe storm rumbled in the near distance. Several of the soldiers turned\ntoward him. Kaladin had a moment of profound disconnect, as if he\ncouldn’t believe he was still alive. As if he’d thought that trudge up the\nstairwell had been his climb to the Tranquiline Halls."

As if he’d thought that trudge up the\nstairwell had been his climb to the Tranquiline Halls.\nThen one of the guards leveled a spear at him, and Kaladin’s body knew\nwhat to do. Exhausted, wounded, nerves worn all the way to Damnation,\nKaladin grabbed that spear and twisted it out of the man’s hands, then swept\nthe legs of the next soldier.\nA few Regals not far off shouted, and he caught sight of a Heavenly One\n—not Leshwi—rising into the air and pointing a lance at him. They weren’t\nthrough with him yet.\nHe turned and ran, holding that stolen spear, drawing in Stormlight from\nlanterns—but feeling it do nothing at all to heal him. Even the slow healing\nfrom before had apparently stopped working. Either he’d further\nundermined his powers somehow by destroying the fabrial, or—more likely\n—the Sibling was too far gone toward corruption.\nChased by dozens of soldiers, Kaladin ran for the storm. Though it was\ndangerous outside, at least the enemy would have difficulty finding him in\nthe tempest. He couldn’t fight them—the only way to escape was to do\nsomething truly desperate.\nHe reached the front entryway of the tower, where winds coursed in\nthrough a portal that might once have held a wooden gate. They’d never\ntaken the time to put in a new one. Why would they? The storms rarely\nreached this high.\nToday they had.\nToday, Kaladin reached the winds.\nAnd like everything else today, they tried their best to kill him.\nVoice of Lights. Voice for Lights. If I speak for the Lights, then I must\nexpress their desires. If Light is Investiture, and all Investiture is deity,\nand deity has Intent, then Light must have Intent.\n—From Rhythm of War, final page\nDalinar no longer feared highstorms.\nIt had been some time now since he’d worried that he was mad. Yet—as\na poorly treated horse learned to flinch at the mere sound of a whip—\nsomething had persisted inside of Dalinar. A learned response that a storm\nmeant losing control.\nSo it was with a deep and satisfying sense of relief that today, Dalinar\nrealized he didn’t fear the storm. Indeed, when Elthebar listed the time of\ntoday’s storm, Dalinar felt a little surge of excitement. He realized he felt\nmore awake on highstorm days. More capable.\nIs that you? he asked of the Stormfather.\nIt is us, the Stormfather replied. Me and you. I enjoy passing over the\ncontinent, as it gives me much to see—but it also tires me as it energizes\nyou.\nDalinar stepped away from the table and dismissed his attendants and\nscribes, who had finished briefing him on the latest intelligence regarding\nUrithiru. He could barely control his mounting concern about Navani and\nthe tower. Something was wrong. He could feel it in his bones.\nSo he’d begun looking for options. The current plan was for him to lead\nan expedition into Shadesmar, sail to the tower, then open up a\nperpendicularity to let spies in. Unfortunately, they didn’t know if it would\nwork.

The latest letters from Navani, although they\ndid contain her passcodes, felt unlike her. Too many delays, too many\nassurances she was fine. He’d ordered a team of workers to begin clearing\nthe rubble that prevented his scouts from entering through the basement.\nThat would reportedly take weeks, and Shardblades couldn’t be summoned\nin the region, being suppressed like fabrials and Radiant powers.\nHe pressed his palm flat against the table, gritting his teeth. He ignored\nthe stack of reports from the front lines. Jasnah and the others were\nhandling the war, and he could see their victory approaching. It wasn’t\ninevitable, but it was highly likely.\nHe should be focusing on his Bondsmith training. But how could he? He\nwanted to find a set of Plate, borrow a Blade, and go march to the\nbattlefront and find someone to attack. The idea was so tempting, he had to\nacknowledge how much he’d come to depend on emotional support from\nthe Thrill of battle. Storms, sometimes he longed so powerfully for the way\nhe’d felt alive when killing. Such emotions were remarkably similar to what\nhe’d felt upon giving up the drink. A quiet, anxious yearning that struck at\nunexpected moments—seeking the pleasure, the reward.\nHe couldn’t blame everything he’d done on the Thrill. That had been\nDalinar in those boots, holding that weapon and glorying in destruction.\nThat had been Dalinar lusting to kill. If he let himself go out and fight\nagain, he knew he’d realize a part of him still loved it.\nAnd so, he had to remain here. Find other ways of solving his problems.\nHe stepped out of his personal dwelling, another small stone hut in Laqqi,\ntheir command city.\nHe took a deep breath, hoping the fresh air would clear his mind. The\nvillage was now fully fortified against both storms and attacks, with high-\nflying scout posts watching the land all around and Windrunners darting in\nto deliver reports.\nI must get better with my powers, Dalinar thought. If I had access to the\nmap I could make with Shallan, we might be able to see exactly what is\nhappening at Urithiru.\nIt would not help, the Stormfather said in his mind, a sound like distant\nthunder. I cannot see the tower. Whatever weakens the Windrunners when\nthey draw close weakens me too, so the map would not reveal the location.\nHowever, I could show it to you. Perhaps you can see better than I.\n“Show me?” Dalinar asked, causing Szeth—his omnipresent shadow—to\nglance at him. “How?”\nYou can ride the storm with me, the Stormfather said. I have given others\nthis privilege on occasion.\n“Ride the storm with you?” Dalinar said.\nIt is like the visions that Honor instructed me to grant, only it is now.\nCome. See.\n“Martra,” Dalinar said, looking to the scribe who had been assigned to\nhim today. “I might act odd for a short time. Nothing is wrong, but if I am\nnot myself when my next appointment begins, please make them wait.”\n“Um … yes, Brightlord,” she said, hugging her ledger, eyes wide."

He didn’t feel like being\nclosed up inside. He liked the scent of the air, even if it was too muggy\nhere, and the sight of the open sky.\nMartra returned with a chair and Dalinar settled himself, facing\neastward. Toward the Origin, toward the storms—though his view was\nblocked by the large stone stormbreak.\n“Stormfather,” he said. “I’m—”\nHe became the storm.\nDalinar soared along the front of the stormwall, like a piece of debris.\nNo … like a gust of wind blowing with the advent of the storm. He could\nsee—comprehend—far more than when he’d flown under Windrunner\npower.\nIt was a great deal to take in. He surged across rolling hills with plants\ngrowing in the valleys between them. From up high it looked like a network\nof brown islands surrounded by greenery—each and every lowland portion\nfilled to the brim with a snarl of underbrush. He’d never seen anything quite\nlike it, the plants unfamiliar to him, though their density did faintly remind\nhim of the Valley where he had met Cultivation.\nHe didn’t have a body, but he turned and saw that he towed a long\nshadow. The storm itself.\nWhen the Windrunner flew on my winds, he zipped about, the\nStormfather said, and Dalinar felt the sounds all around him. You simply\nthink. You complain about meetings, but you are well suited to them.\n“I grow,” Dalinar said. “I change. It is the mark of humanity,\nStormfather, to change. A prime tenet of our religion. When I was Kaladin’s\nage, I suspect I would have acted as he.”\nWe approach the mountains, the Stormfather said. Urithiru will come\nsoon. Be ready to watch.\nA mountain range started to grow up to Dalinar’s right, and he realized\nwhere they must be—blowing through Triax or Tu Fallia, countries with\nwhich he had little experience. These weren’t the mountains where he’d\nfind Urithiru, not yet. So he experimented with motion, soaring closer to the\novergrown valleys.\nYes … this landscape was alien to him, the way the underbrush snarled\ntogether so green. Full of grass, broad leaves, and other stalks, all woven\ntogether with vines and bobbing with lifespren. The vines were a netting\ntying it all together, tight against storms.\nHe saw curious animals with long tentacles for arms and leathery skin\ninstead of chitin. Malleable, they easily squeezed through holes in the\nunderbrush and found tight pockets in which to hide as the stormwall hit.\nStrange that everything would be so different when it wasn’t that far from\nAlethkar. Only a little trip across the Tarat Sea.\nHe tried to hang back to inspect one of the animals.\nNo, the Stormfather said. Forward.

Ever forward.\nDalinar let himself be encouraged onward, sweeping across the hills\nuntil he reached a place where the underbrush had been hollowed out to\nbuild homes. These valleys weren’t so narrow or deep that flooding would\nbe a danger, and the buildings were built on stilts a few feet high anyway.\nThey were grown over by the same vine netting, the edges of the buildings\nmelding with the underbrush to borrow its strength.\nOnce, this village had likely been in an enviable location—protected by\nthe surrounding plants. Unfortunately, as he blew past, he noted multiple\nburned-out buildings, the rest of the village in shambles.\nThe Everstorm. Dalinar’s people had adapted to it; large cities already\nhad walls on all sides, and small villages had been able to rely upon their\ngovernment’s stockpiles to help them survive this change in climate. But\nsmall, isolated villages like this had taken the brunt of the new storm with\nnobody to help. How many such places existed on Roshar, hovering on the\nedge of extinction?\nDalinar was past the place in a few heartbeats, but the memory lingered.\nOver the last two years, what cities and towns hadn’t been broken by the\nsudden departure of the parshmen had been relentlessly attacked by storm\nor battle. If they won—when they won—the war, they would have a great\ndeal of work to do in rebuilding the world.\nAs he continued his flight, he saw something else discouraging: a pair of\nforagers trapped while making their way back toward their home. The\nragged men huddled together in a too-shallow ravine. They wore clothing of\nthick woven fibers that looked like the rug material that came out of Marat,\nand their spears weren’t even metal.\n“Take mercy upon them,” Dalinar said. “Temper your fury, Stormfather.”\nIt is not fury. It is me.\n“Then protect them,” Dalinar said as the stormwall hit, plunging the ill-\nfated men into darkness.\nShould I protect all who venture out into me?\n“Yes.”\nThen do I stop being a storm, stop being me?\n“You can be a storm with mercy.”\nThat defies the definition and soul of a storm, the Stormfather said. I\nmust blow. I make this land exist. I carry seeds; I birth plants; I make the\nlandscape permanent with crem. I provide Light. Without me, Roshar\nwithers.\n“I’m not asking you to abandon Roshar, but to protect those men. Right\nhere. Right now.”\nI … the Stormfather rumbled. It is too late. They did not survive the\nstormwall. A large boulder crushed them soon after we began speaking.\nDalinar cursed, an action that translated as crackling lightning in the\nnearby air. “How can a being so close to divinity be so utterly lacking in\nhonor?”\nI am a storm. I cannot—\nYou are not merely a storm! Dalinar bellowed, his voice changing to\nrumbles of thunder. You are capable of choice! You hide from that, and in so\ndoing, you are a COWARD!\nThe Stormfather did not respond. Dalinar felt him there, subdued—like a\npetulant child scolded for their foolishness. Good.

Both Dalinar and the\nStormfather were different from what they once had been. They had to be\nbetter. The world demanded that they be better.\nDalinar soared up higher, no longer wanting to see specifics—in case he\nwas to witness more of the Stormfather’s unthinking brutality. Eventually\nthey reached snow-dusted mountains, and Dalinar soared to the very top of\nthe storm. Lately the storms had been creeping higher and higher in the sky\n—something people wouldn’t normally notice, but which was quite obvious\nin Urithiru.\nIt is natural, the Stormfather said. A cycle. I will go higher and higher\nuntil I am taller than the tower, then the next few storms will lower. The\nhighstorm did this before the tower existed.\nThere seemed to be a timidity to the words, uncharacteristic of the\nStormfather. Perhaps Dalinar had rattled him.\nSoon he saw the tower approaching.\nYou can see it? the Stormfather said. The details?\n“Yes,” Dalinar said.\nLook quickly. We will pass rapidly.\nDalinar steered himself as a gust of wind, fixating upon Urithiru.\nNothing seemed overtly wrong with it. There wasn’t anyone up on the\nCloudwalk level, but with the storms growing higher, that wouldn’t be\nadvisable anyway.\n“Can we go inside?” Dalinar asked as they approached.\nYou may, the Stormfather said. I cannot go inside, just as I cannot infuse\nspheres indoors. When a piece splits off, it is no longer me. You will need to\nquickly rejoin, or the vision will end.\nDalinar picked the lowest accessible balcony in the tower’s east-jutting\nlobes, up on the fourth tier, and lowered himself until he was right on target.\nAs the storm passed, he soared in through the open balcony into the quiet\nhallway beyond.\nIt was over too swiftly. A rush through a dark hallway until he found the\nsouthern diagonal corridor, where he tried to reach the ground floor, but\nDalinar was suddenly pulled out another balcony without having seen any\nsigns of life. The stormwall passed by to crest the mountains and continue\non toward Azir and his body.\n“No,” Dalinar said. “We need to look again.”\nYou must continue forward. Momentum, Dalinar.\n“Momentum kept me doing terrible things, Stormfather. Momentum\nalone is not a virtue.”\nWe cannot do what you ask.\n“Stop making excuses and try for once!” Dalinar said, provoking\nlightning around him. He resisted the push to continue at the front and—\nthough it caused the Stormfather to groan with fits of thunder—Dalinar\nmoved into the inner portions of the storm. The black chaos behind the\nstormwall.\nHe was wind blowing against wind, a man swimming against a tide, but\nhe pushed all the way back to Urithiru. The Stormfather grumbled, but\nDalinar didn’t sense pain from the spren. Just … surprise.

The fury of the wind tugged at him. The\nStormfather rumbled, and lightning flashed.\nThere. Dalinar felt something. A … faint Connection, like when he\nlearned someone’s language. His Surgebinding, his powers, drew him\nthrough the wind around the outside base of the tower—until he found\nsomething remarkable. A single figure, almost invisible in the darkness,\nclinging to the outside of the tower on the eighth level.\nKaladin Stormblessed.\nDalinar could not fathom what had brought the Windrunner to expose\nhimself like this in a storm, but here he was. Holding on tightly to a ledge.\nHis clothing was ragged, and he was wounded—bleeding from numerous\ncuts.\n“Blood of my fathers,” Dalinar whispered. “Stormfather, do you see\nhim?”\nI … feel him, the Stormfather said. Through you. He seems to be waiting\nfor the center of the storm, where his spheres and Stormlight will renew.\nDalinar drew close to the young man, who had buried his head into his\nshoulder for protection. He was soaked through, a piece of his shirt slapping\nagainst the stone over and over.\n“Kaladin?” Dalinar shouted. “Kaladin, what has happened?”\nThe young man didn’t move. Dalinar calmed himself, resisting the\nfurious winds, and drew power from the soul of the storm.\nKALADIN, he said.\nKaladin shifted, turning his head. His skin had gone pale, his hair matted\nand whipped into rain-drenched knots. Storms … he looked like a dead\nman.\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED? Dalinar demanded as the storm.\n“Singer invasion,” Kaladin whispered into the wind. “Navani captured.\nThe tower on lockdown. Other Radiants are all unconscious.”\nI WILL FIND HELP.\n“Radiant powers don’t work. Except mine. Maybe those of a Bondsmith.\nI’m fighting. I’m … trying.”\nLIFE BEFORE DEATH.\n“Life…” Kaladin whispered. “Life … before…” The man’s eyes\nfluttered closed. He sagged, going limp, and dropped off the wall,\nunconscious.\nNO. Dalinar gathered the winds, and with a surge of strength, used them\nto hurl Kaladin up and over the ledge of the balcony, onto the eighth floor\nof the tower.\nThat strained his abilities, and at last the tide grabbed Dalinar and forced\nhim toward the front of the storm. As it happened, he was ejected from the\nvision and found himself in Emul, sitting in his chair. An honor guard of\nsoldiers had arrived, forming a circle around him so people couldn’t gawk.\nThough it had been a long time since Dalinar had been taken involuntarily\nin a vision, he appreciated the gesture.\nHe shook himself, rising to stand. Nearby, Martra held up her notebook.\n“I wrote down everything you said and did! Like Brightness Navani used\nto. Did I do it right?”\n“Thank you,” Dalinar said, scanning what she’d written.

Only, Martra\nhadn’t heard the parts where he’d spoken as the storm.\nOne of the guards coughed, and Dalinar noticed one of the others\ngawking at him. The youth turned away immediately, blushing.\nBecause I was reading, Dalinar thought, handing back the notebook. He\nlooked at the sky, expecting to see stormclouds—though here the highstorm\nwould still be hours away from this region.\nStormfather, he thought. The tower was invaded. Our worst fears are\nconfirmed. The enemy controls Urithiru. Storms, that felt painful to\nacknowledge. First Alethkar, then the tower? And Navani captured?\nNow he knew why the enemy had thrown away Taravangian. Maybe\neven the entire army here in Emul. They’d been sacrificed to keep Dalinar\noccupied.\n“Go to Teshav,” Dalinar said to Martra. “Have her gather the monarchs\nand my highlords. I need to call an emergency meeting. Cancel everything\nelse I was to do today.”\nThe young woman yelped, perhaps at being given such an important\ntask. She ran on his orders immediately. The soldiers parted at Dalinar’s\nrequest, and he looked toward the sky again.\nStormfather, did you hear me?\nYou have hurt me, Dalinar. This is the second time you have done so. You\npush against our bond, forcing me to do things that are not right.\nI push you to stretch, Dalinar said. That is always painful. Did you hear\nwhat Stormblessed told me?\nYes, he said. But he is wrong. Your powers will not work at Urithiru. It\nseems … they have turned the tower’s protections against us. If that is true,\nyou would need to be orders of magnitude stronger, more experienced than\nyou are, to open a perpendicularity there. You’d have to be strong enough\nto overwhelm the Sibling.\nI need to say more oaths, Dalinar said. I need to better understand what I\ncan do. My training goes too slowly. We need to find a way to speed it up.\nI cannot help you. Honor is dead. He was the only one who knew what\nyou could do, in full. He was the only one that could have trained you.\nDalinar growled in frustration. He began to pace the unworked stone in\nfront of his warcamp house.\nKaladin, Shallan, Jasnah, Lift … all of them picked up on their powers\nnaturally, Dalinar said. But here I am, many months after our Bonding, and\nI have barely progressed.\nYou are something different from them, the Stormfather replied.\nSomething greater, more dangerous. But also more complicated. There has\nnever been another like you.\nDistant thunder. Drawing closer.\nExcept … the Stormfather said.\nDalinar looked up as a thought struck him.

Except for Nale.”\n“But there was one of you who was a Bondsmith,” Dalinar said. “Ishi,\nHerald of Luck, Herald of Mysteries, Binder of Gods.”\n“Creator of the Oathpact,” Shalash said, forcing herself out of Dalinar’s\ngrip. “Yes, yes. We all have names like that. Useless names. You should\nstop talking about us. Stop worshipping us. Stop painting us.”\n“He’s still alive,” Dalinar said. “He was unchained by the oaths. He\nwould understand what I can learn to do.”\n“I’m sure,” Shalash said. “If any—except me—are still sane, it would be\nhim.”\n“He’s near here,” Dalinar said, in awe. “In Tukar. Not more than a short\nflight southeast of this very town.”\n“Isn’t there an army in the way?” Shalash said. “Isn’t pushing the enemy\nback—crushing them into Ishar’s army—our main goal right now?”\n“That’s what Jasnah and our army are doing,” Dalinar said. “But I have\nanother task. I need to find a way to speak to the god-priest, then convince\nhim to help me rescue Urithiru.”\nIntent matters. Intent is king. You cannot do what I attempt by\naccident. You must mean it.

I pried it\nout of the Sibling, walking directly into the enemy’s plan.\n“You shouldn’t be too hard on yourself,” Raboniel said. “The Sibling is\ntruly to blame—they always have been so innocent. And unaware of their\nown naiveness. When I touched the pillar, I knew the Sibling was awake—\nbut pretending to be dead. So I let the ruse continue, and I listened. I\ncouldn’t know that decision would bear fruit, but that is why you nurture\nnine seeds and watch for the one that begins growing.”\n“The Sibling told me…” Navani said. “They said we couldn’t outthink\nyou.”\n“Yes, I heard that,” Raboniel said. “It made me worry that you’d spotted\nmy surveillance. It seemed too obvious a line said to distract me.”\n“How?” Navani asked, opening her eyes. “How did you do it, Ancient\nOne? Surely the Sibling would have known if their communication could be\ncompromised.”\nRaboniel hummed a rhythm, then walked over and tapped Navani’s\nstacks of notes. “Study. Find us answers about Light, Navani. Stop trying to\nfight me; help me end this war instead. That was always your purpose\nhere.”\nNavani felt nausea stirring her insides. She’d thrown up once already\nfrom the sick feeling of what she’d done. What she’d cost the Sibling. She\nforced it down this time, and as Raboniel left, she managed to ask one more\nquestion.\n“Kaladin,” she said. “The Windrunner. Did you kill him, Ancient One?”\n“I didn’t,” she said. “Though I did land a fine cut on him. You have\nlikely realized that he succeeded in destroying the node, as the shield is still\nup. However, when the Windrunner was spotted fleeing the tower a good\nhalf hour after, his wound hadn’t healed—so I think the Sibling’s\ntransformation is almost complete. This makes your Windrunner’s powers\nquite unreliable. I find it unlikely he survived after running out into the\nstorm.”\n“Into the storm?” Navani asked.\n“Yes. A pity. Perhaps the Sibling can tell you if he is dead or not—if so, I\nshould very much like to study his corpse.”\nRaboniel left. Navani pushed through her sickness to write, then burn, a\nprayer of protection for Kaladin. It was all she could do.\nThen she rested her head on the table to think about the profound scope\nof her failure.\nTHE END OF\nPart Three"

It was all she could do.\nThen she rested her head on the table to think about the profound scope\nof her failure.\nTHE END OF\nPart Three\nSzeth-son-Honor tried to slouch.\nDalinar said that slouching a little would help him imitate an ordinary\nsoldier on a boring guard duty. Dalinar said Szeth prowled when he walked,\nand was too intense when standing at watch. Like a fire burning high when\nit should be smoldering.\nHow did one stop being intense? Szeth tried to understand this as he\nforced himself to lean against a tree, folding his arms as Dalinar had\nsuggested. In front of him, the Blackthorn played with his grandnephew, the\nchild of Elhokar. Szeth carefully checked the perimeter of the small\nclearing. Watching for shadows. Or for people suspiciously lingering in the\nnearby camp—visible through the trees.\nHe saw nothing, which troubled him. But he tried to relax anyway.\nThe cloudy sky and muggy weather today were reminiscent of the coast\nof Shinovar, where Szeth’s father had worked as a shepherd in his youth.\nWith this thick grass, Szeth could almost imagine he was home. Near the\nbeautiful white cliffs, listening to lambs bleat as he carried water.\nHe heard his father’s gentle words. The best and truest duty of a person\nis to add to the world. To create, and not destroy.\nBut no. Szeth was not home. He was standing on profane stone in a\nforest clearing outside a small town in Emul. Dalinar knelt down, showing\nGavinor—a child not yet five—how to hold his practice sword.\nIt had been a few minutes, so Szeth left the tree and made a circuit of the\nclearing, inspecting a few suspicious bundles of vines. “Do you see\nanything dangerous, sword-nimi?” he asked softly.\nNope, the sword said. I think you should draw me. I can see better when\nI’m drawn.\n“When you are drawn, sword-nimi, you attempt to drain my life.”\nNonsense. I like you. I wouldn’t try to kill you.\nThe weapon projected its pleasant voice into Szeth’s mind. Dalinar\ndidn’t like the sensation, so the sword now spoke only to Szeth.\n“I see nothing dangerous,” Szeth said, returning to his place beside the\ntree, then tried to at least appear relaxed. It was difficult, requiring\nvigilance and dedication, but he did not want to be chastised by Dalinar\nagain.\nThat’s good, right? Nothing dangerous?\n“No, sword-nimi,” Szeth said. “It is not good. It is concerning. Dalinar\nhas so many enemies; they will be sending assassins, spies. If I do not see\nthem, perhaps I am too lax or too unskilled.”\nOr maybe they aren’t here to find, the sword said. Vasher was always\nparanoid too. And he could sense if people were near. I told him to stop\nworrying so much. Like you. Worry, worry, worry.\n“I have been given a duty,” Szeth said. “I will do it well.”\nDalinar laughed as the young boy held his toy sword high and\nproclaimed himself a Windrunner.

        "text": "“I have been given a duty,” Szeth said. “I will do it well.”\nDalinar laughed as the young boy held his toy sword high and\nproclaimed himself a Windrunner. The child had been through a horrifying\nexperience back in Kholinar, and he was quiet much of the time. Haunted.\nHe’d been tortured by Voidspren, manipulated by the Unmade, neglected by\nhis mother. Though Szeth’s sufferings had been different, he couldn’t help\nbut feel a kinship with the child.\nDalinar clearly enjoyed seeing the child become more expressive and\nenthusiastic as they played. Szeth was reminded again of his own childhood\nspent playing with the sheep. A simple time, before his family had been\ngiven to the Honorblades. Before his gentle father had been taught to kill.\nTo subtract.\nHis father was still alive, in Shinovar. Bearer of a different sword, a\ndifferent burden. Szeth’s entire family was there. His sister, his mother. It\nhad been long since he’d considered them. He let himself do so now\nbecause he’d decided he wasn’t Truthless. Before, he hadn’t wanted to sully\ntheir images with his mind.\nTime to make another round of the clearing. The child’s laughter grew\nlouder, but Szeth found it painful to hear. He winced as the boy jumped up\non a rock, then leaped for his granduncle to catch him. And Szeth … if\nSzeth moved too quickly, he could catch sight of his own frail soul, attached\nincorrectly to his body, trailing his motions like a glowing afterimage.\nWhy do you hurt? the sword asked.\n“I am afraid for the child,” Szeth whispered. “He begins to laugh\nhappily. That will eventually be stolen from him again.”\nI like to try to understand laughter, the sword said. I think I can feel it.\nHappy. Ha! HA! Vivenna always liked my jokes. Even the bad ones.\n“The boy’s laughter frightens me,” Szeth said. “Because I am near. And I\nam … not well.”\nHe should not guard this child, but he could not bring himself to tell\nDalinar, for fear the Blackthorn would send him away. Szeth had found\npurpose here in following an Ideal. In trusting Dalinar Kholin. He could not\nafford to have that Ideal shaken. He could not.\nExcept … Dalinar spoke uncertainly sometimes. Concerned that he\nwasn’t doing the right thing. Szeth wished he didn’t hear Dalinar’s\nweakness, his worries. The Blackthorn needed to be a moral rock,\nunshakable, always certain.\nDalinar was better than most. He was confident. Most of the time. Szeth\nhad only ever met one man more confident than Dalinar in his own\nmorality. Taravangian. The tyrant. The destroyer. The man who had\nfollowed Szeth here to this remote part of the world. Szeth was certain that,\nwhen he’d been visiting Taravangian with Dalinar the other day, the old\nman had seen through his illusory disguise.\nThe man would not let go. Szeth could feel him … feel him … plotting.\nWhen Szeth returned to his tree, the air split, showing a blackness\nspeckled faintly with stars beyond. Szeth immediately set down his sword"

Szeth immediately set down his sword\nby the trunk of the tree.\n“Watch,” he said, “and shout for me if danger comes.”\nOh! All right! the sword said. I can do that. Yes, I can. You might want to\nleave me drawn though. You know, so that if someone bad comes along, I\ncan really get ’em.\nSzeth walked around the rear of the tree, following the rift in the air. It\nwas as if someone had pried back the fabric of reality, like splitting skin to\nlook at the flesh underneath.\nHe knelt before the highspren.\n“You do well, my acolyte,” the spren said, its tone formal. “You are\nvigilant and dedicated.”\n“I am,” Szeth said.\n“We need to discuss your crusade. You are a year into your current oath,\nand I am pleased and impressed with your dedication. You are among the\nmost vigilant and worthy of men. I would have you earn your Plate. You\nstill wish to cleanse your homeland?”\nSzeth nodded. Behind, Dalinar laughed. He didn’t seem to have noticed\nSzeth’s momentary departure.\n“Tell me more of this proposed crusade,” the highspren said. It had not\nblessed Szeth with its name, though Szeth was its bonded Radiant.\n“Long ago, my people rejected my warnings,” Szeth said. “They did not\nbelieve me when I said the enemy would soon return. They cast me out,\ndeemed me Truthless.”\n“I find inconsistencies to the stories you tell of those days, Szeth,” the\nhighspren said. “I fear that your memory, like those of many mortals, is\nincomplete or corrupted by the passage of time. I will accompany you on\nyour crusade to judge the truth.”\n“Thank you,” Szeth said softly.\n“You may need to fight and destroy those who have broken their own\nlaws. Can you do this?”\n“I … would need to ask Dalinar. He is my Ideal.”\n“If you progress as a Skybreaker,” the highspren said, “you will need to\nbecome the law. To reach your ultimate potential, you must know the truth\nyourself, rather than relying on the crutch presented by the Third Ideal. Be\naware of this.”\n“I will.”\n“Continue your duty for now. But remember, the time will soon come\nwhen you must abandon it for something greater.”\nSzeth stood as the spren made itself invisible again. It was always\nnearby, watching and judging his worthiness. He entered the clearing and\nfound Dalinar chatting quietly with a woman in a messenger uniform.\nImmediately Szeth came alert, seizing the sword and striding over to\nstand behind Dalinar, prepared to protect him.\nI hope it’s all right that I didn’t call for you! the sword said. I could sense\nher, although I couldn’t see her, and she seemed to be not evil. Even if she\ndidn’t come over to pick me up. Isn’t that rude? But rude people can be not\nevil, right?\nSzeth watched the woman carefully. If someone wanted to kill Dalinar,\nthey’d surely send an assassin who seemed innocent."

If someone wanted to kill Dalinar,\nthey’d surely send an assassin who seemed innocent.\n“I’m not sure about some of the things on this list,” she was saying. “A\npen and paper? For a man?”\n“Taravangian has long since abandoned the pretense of being unable to\nread,” Dalinar said.\n“Then paper will let him plot against us.”\n“Perhaps,” Dalinar said. “It could also simply be a mercy, giving him the\ncompanionship of words. Fulfill that request. What else?”\n“He wishes to be given fresh food more often,” she said. “And more\nlight.”\n“I asked for the light already,” Dalinar said. “Why hasn’t the order been\nfulfilled?”\nSzeth watched keenly. Taravangian was making demands? They should\ngive him nothing. He was dangerous. He …\nSzeth froze as the little boy, Gavinor, stepped up to him. He raised a\nwooden sword hilt-first toward Szeth. The boy should fear him, yet instead\nhe smiled and waggled the sword.\nSzeth took it, hesitant.\n“The stone is the oddest request,” the messenger woman said. “Why\nwould he have need of a perfectly round, smooth stone? And why would he\nspecify one with a vein of quartz?”\nSzeth’s heart nearly stopped. A round stone. With quartz inclusions?\n“An odd request indeed,” Dalinar said, thoughtful. “Ask him why he\nwants this before fulfilling the request.”\nA round stone.\nWith quartz inclusions.\nAn Oathstone.\nFor years, Szeth had obeyed the law of the Oathstone. The centuries-old\ntradition among his people dictated the way to treat someone who was\nTruthless. An object, no longer a man. Something to own.\nTaravangian wanted an Oathstone. Why?\nWHY?\nAs the messenger trotted away, Dalinar asked if Szeth would like to join\nsword practice, but he could barely mumble an excuse. Szeth returned to his\nspot by the tree, clutching the little wooden sword.\nHe had to know what Taravangian was planning.\nHe had to stop the man. Before he killed Dalinar.\nChiri-Chiri tried to hide in her grass. Unfortunately, she was growing too\nbig. She wasn’t like a regular cremling, those that scuttled around, tiny and\ninsignificant. She was something grander. She could think. She could grow.\nAnd she could fly.\nNone of that helped as she tumbled out of the grass of the pot onto the\ndesktop. She rolled over and clicked in annoyance, then looked toward\nRysn, who sat making noises with another soft one. Chiri-Chiri did not\nalways understand the mouth noises of the soft ones. They did not click,\nand there was no rhythm to them. So the sounds were sometimes just\nnoises.\nSometimes they were not. There was a pattern to them that she was\ngrowing better at understanding. And there was a mood at times to their\ntones, almost like a rhythm. She crawled closer along the desk, trying to\nlisten.\nIt was difficult. Chiri-Chiri did not like listening.

Saying she was happy, or\nhungry, or sad felt right.\nCommunication should be about moods, desires, needs. Not all these\nflapping, flapping, sloppy wet noises.\nLike the ones Rysn made now, talking to the old soft one who was like a\nparent. Chiri-Chiri crawled over the desk and into her box. It didn’t smell as\nalive as the grass, but it was nice, stuffed with soft things and covered over\nwith some vines. She clicked for it. Contentment. Contentment felt right.\n“I do not understand half of what you explain, Rysn,” the old soft one\nsaid as the two sat in chairs beside the table. Chiri-Chiri understood some of\nthe words. And his hushed tone, yet tense. Confused. That was confusion.\nLike when you are bitten on the tail by one you thought was happy. “You’re\nsaying these things … these Sleepless … are all around us? Moving among\nus? But they aren’t … human?”\n“They are as far from human as a being can get, I should guess,” Rysn\nsaid, sipping her tea. Chiri-Chiri understood her better. Rysn wasn’t\nconfused. More thoughtful. She’d been that way ever since … the event at\nthe homeland.\n“This is not what I thought I was preparing you for,” the old soft one\nsaid, “with your training in negotiation.”\n“Well, you always liked to travel paths others thought too difficult,”\nRysn said. “And you relished trading with people ignored by your\ncompetition. You saw opportunity in what others discarded. This is\nsomewhat the same.”\n“Pardon, Rysn—dear child—but this feels very different.”\nThe two fell silent, but it wasn’t the contented silence of having just\neaten. Chiri-Chiri turned to snuggle back into her blankets, but felt a\nvibration coming up through the ground. A kind of call, a kind of warning.\nOne of the rhythms of Roshar.\nIt reminded her of the carapace of the dead ones she had seen in the\nhomeland. Their hollow skull chitin, their gaping emptiness, so still and\nnoiseless. A silence of having eaten all, and having then been consumed.\nChiri-Chiri could not hide. The rhythm whispered that she could not do\nonly easy things. Dark times were coming, the hollow skulls warned. And\nthe vibrations of that place. Encouraging. Demanding. Be better. You must\nbe better.\nAnd so, Chiri-Chiri climbed out of her box and crawled up onto the arm\nof Rysn’s chair. Rysn scooped her up, assuming she wanted scratches at the\npart along her head where carapace met skin. And it did feel nice. Nice\nenough that Chiri-Chiri forgot about hollow skulls and warning rhythms.\n“Why do I feel,” the old soft one said, “that you shouldn’t have told me\nabout any of this? The more people who know what you’ve done, Rysn, the\nmore dangerous it will be for you.”\n“I realize this,” she said. “But … Babsk … I had to tell someone. I need\nyour wisdom, now more than ever.”"

I need\nyour wisdom, now more than ever.”\n“My wisdom does not extend to the dealings of gods, Rysn,” he said. “I\nam just an old man who thought himself clever … until his self-indulgences\nnearly destroyed the life and career of his most promising apprentice.”\nRysn sat up sharply, causing Chiri-Chiri to start and nip at her fingers.\nWhy did she stop scratching?\nOh. Emotions. Chiri-Chiri could nearly feel them thrumming through\nRysn, like rhythms. She was sad? Why sad? They had enough to eat. It was\nwarm and safe.\nWas it about the hollowness? The danger?\n“Babsk,” Rysn said. “You still blame yourself for my foolishness? My\nfollies were mine alone.”\n“Ah, but I knew of your brashness,” he said. “And it was my duty to\ncheck it.” He took her hands, so Chiri-Chiri nipped at them a little—until\nRysn glared at her. They didn’t taste good anyway.\nThe two soft ones shared something. Almost like they could project\nemotions with a vibration or a buzz, instead of flapping their lips and\nsquishing their too-melty faces. Those really were odd. Why didn’t all their\nskin flop off, without carapace to hold it in? Why didn’t they hurt\nthemselves on everything they bumped?\nBut yes, they shared thoughts. And finally the old one nodded, standing.\n“I will help you bear this, Rysn. Yes, I should not complain about my own\ndeficiencies. You have come to me, and show me great honor in doing so.”\n“But you mustn’t tell anyone,” she said to him. “Not even the queen. I’m\nsorry.”\n“I understand,” he said. “I will ponder what you’ve told me, then see\nwhat advice—if any—I can have on this unique situation.” He took his hat\nand moved to leave, but hesitated and said a single word. “Dawnshards.”\nHe imbued it with meaning somehow. Disbelief and wonder.\nAfter he’d left, a few nips got Rysn to start scratching again. But she felt\ndistracted, and soon Chiri-Chiri was unable to enjoy the scratches. Not with\nthe hollow eyes speaking to her. Warning her.\nTo enjoy easy days, sometimes you had to first do difficult things. Rysn\nactivated her chair—which flew a few inches off the ground, though it\ndidn’t have any wings. Chiri-Chiri jumped off onto the desk.\n“I need something to eat,” Rysn said. And Chiri-Chiri concentrated on\nthe sounds, not the tired cadence.\nEat. Food.\n“Eeeaaat.” Chiri-Chiri tried to get her mandibles to click the sounds,\nblowing through her throat and making her carapace vibrate.\nRysn smiled. “I’m too tired. That almost sounded…”\n“Rrrrrizzznn,” Chiri-Chiri said. “Eeeeaat. Voood.” Yes, that seemed\nright. Those were good mouth noises. At least, Rysn dropped her cup of tea\nand made a shocked vibration."

Not just because of the hollow\nskulls. But because, if the soft ones could be made to understand, it would\nbe far easier to get scratches when they were required.\nTaravangian awoke hurting. Lately, each morning was a bitter contest. Did\nit hurt more to move or to stay in bed? Moving meant more pain. Staying in\nbed meant more anguish. Eventually he chose pain.\nAfter dressing himself with some difficulty, he rested at the edge of the\nbed, exhausted. He glanced at the notes scratched on the side of an open\ndrawer. Should he hide that? He should. The words appeared jumbled to\nhim today. He had to stare at them a long time to get them to make sense.\nDumb. How dumb was he? Too … too dumb. He recognized the\nsensation, his thoughts moving as if through thick syrup. He stood. Was that\nlight? Yes, sunlight.\nHe shuffled into the main room of his prison. Sunlight, through an open\nwindow. Strange. He hadn’t left a window open.\nWindows were all boarded up, he thought. Someone broke one. Maybe a\nstorm?\nNo. He slowly realized that Dalinar must have ordered one opened.\nKindly Dalinar. He liked that man.\nTaravangian made his way to the sunlight. Guards outside. Yes, they\nwould watch. They knew he was a murderer. He smiled at them anyway,\nthen opened the small bundle on the windowsill. A notebook, a pen, and\nsome ink. Had he asked for that? He tried to remember.\nStorms. He wanted to sleep. But he couldn’t sleep through another day.\nHe’d done that too often.\nHe returned to his room and sat—then realized he had forgotten what\nhe’d intended to do. He retraced his steps, looked down at the pen and\npaper again, and only then remembered. He went back into his bedroom.\nUnhooked the drawer with the instructions. Slowly read them.\nThen again.\nHe laboriously copied them into the notebook. They were a list of things\nhe needed to say if he could meet Szeth alone. Several times, the words\n“Don’t talk to Dalinar” were underlined. In his current state, Taravangian\nwas uncertain about that. Why not talk to him?\nSmarter him was convinced they needed to do this themselves. Dalinar\nKholin could not be entrusted with Taravangian’s plans. For Dalinar Kholin\nwould do what was right. Not what was needed.\nTaravangian forced himself to get food. He had some in the other room,\nbread that had gone stale. He should have asked for better food. Only after\nchewing on it did he think to go look at the table right inside his door where\nthey delivered his meals. Today was the day new food came. And there it\nwas. Fresh bread. Dried meat. No jam.\nHe felt like a fool. Why not look for fresh food before forcing yourself to\nchoke down the old stuff? It was difficult to live like this. Making easy\nmistakes.

Before he’d gotten good staff, people had always\nbeen so angry at him when he was stupid. And since he got emotional when\nstupid, he often cried. Didn’t they understand? He made their lives difficult.\nBut he lived the difficulty. He wasn’t trying to be a problem.\nPeople took their minds for granted. They thought themselves wonderful\nbecause of how they’d been born.\n“Traitor!” a voice called into the room. “You have a visitor!”\nTaravangian felt a spike of alarm, his fingers shaking as he closed and\ngripped the notebook. A visitor? Szeth had come? Taravangian’s planted\nseed bore fruit?\nHe breathed in and out, trying to sort through his thoughts. They were a\njumble, and the shouting guard made him jump, then scramble toward the\nsound. He prepared himself for the sight of Szeth. That haunted stare. Those\ndead eyes. Instead, at the window, Taravangian saw a young man with black\nhair peppered blond. The Blackthorn’s son Renarin.\nTaravangian hesitated, though the guards waved for Taravangian to come\nspeak to the youth.\nHe hadn’t prepared for this. Renarin. Their quiet salvation. Why had he\ncome? Taravangian hadn’t prepared responses in his notebook for this\nmeeting.\nTaravangian stepped up to the window, and the guards retreated to give\nthem privacy. Here Taravangian waited, expecting Renarin to speak first.\nYet the boy stood silent, keeping his distance from the window—as if he\nthought Taravangian would reach out and grab him.\nTaravangian’s hands were cold. His stomach churned.\n“Something changed,” Renarin finally said, looking away as he spoke.\nHe avoided meeting people’s eyes. Why? “About you. Recently. Why?”\n“I do not know, Brightlord,” Taravangian said—though he felt sweat on\nhis brow at the lie.\n“You’ve hurt my father,” Renarin said. “I believe he thought, up until\nrecently, that he could change you. I don’t know that I’ve seen him as\nmorose as when he speaks of you.”\n“I would…” Taravangian tried to think. Words. What words? “I would\nthat he had changed me, Brightlord. I would that I could have been\nchanged.”\n“I believe that is true,” Renarin said. “I see your future, Taravangian. It is\ndark. Not like anything I’ve seen before. Except there’s a point of light\nflickering in the darkness. I worry what it will mean if that goes out.”\n“I would worry too.”\n“I can be wrong,” Renarin said. He hesitated, then closed his eyes—as if\ncarefully thinking through his next words. “You are in darkness,\nTaravangian, and my father thinks you are lost. I lived through his return,\nand it taught me that no man is ever so far lost that he cannot find his way\nback. You are not alone.”\nThe young man opened his eyes, stepped forward, then lifted his hand\nand presented it toward Taravangian. The gesture felt awkward. As if"

As if\nRenarin wasn’t quite sure what he was doing.\nHe wants me to take his hand.\nTaravangian didn’t. Seeing it made him want to break into tears, but he\ncontained himself.\nRenarin withdrew his hand and nodded. “I’ll let you know if I see\nsomething that could help you decide.” With that the boy left, accompanied\nby one of the guards—the man who had yelled at Taravangian earlier.\nThat left one other guard: a short, nondescript Alethi man who walked\nup to the window to eye Taravangian. Taravangian watched Renarin\nwalking away, wishing he had the courage to call after the boy.\nFoolish emotions. Taravangian was not lost in darkness. He had chosen\nthis path, and he knew precisely where he was going. Didn’t he?\n“He is wrong,” the guard said. “We can’t all return from the dark. There\nare some acts that, once committed, will always taint a man.”\nTaravangian frowned. That guard had a strange accent. He must have\nlived in Shinovar.\n“Why did you ask for an Oathstone?” the guard demanded. “What is\nyour purpose? Do you wish to tempt or trick me?”\n“I don’t even know you.”\nThe man stared at him with unblinking eyes. Eyes like one of the\ndead … and Taravangian finally understood what on any other day he\nwould have seen immediately. The guard wore a different illusion today.\n“Szeth,” Taravangian whispered.\n“Why? Why do you seek an Oathstone? I will not follow your orders\nagain. I am becoming my own man.”\n“Do you have the sword?” Taravangian asked. He reached out, foolish\nthough it was, and tried to grab Szeth. The man stepped away in an easy\nmotion, leaving Taravangian grasping at air. “The sword. Did you bring it?”\n“I will not serve you,” Szeth said.\n“Listen to me,” Taravangian said. “You have to … the sword … Wait a\nmoment.” He furiously began flipping through the notebook for the words\nhe’d copied from the desk drawer.\n“‘The sword,’” he read, “‘is something we didn’t anticipate. It was\nnowhere in the Diagram. But Odium fears it. Do you understand? He fears\nit. I think it might be able to harm him. We attack him with it.’”\n“I will not serve you,” Szeth said. “I will not be manipulated by you\nagain. My stone … was always only a stone.… My father said…”\n“Your father is dead, Szeth,” Taravangian said. “Listen to me. Listen.”\nHe read from the notebook. “‘Fortunately, I believe his ability to see us here\nis limited. Therefore, we may talk freely. I doubt you can harm Odium\ndirectly unless you are in one of his visions. You must get into one of those\nvisions. Can you do this?’”\nThere were more notes in the book about how to manipulate Szeth.\nTaravangian read them, and the words made him hurt. Hadn’t this man been"

Hadn’t this man been\nthrough enough?\nHe rejected those manipulations and looked up at Szeth. “Please,”\nTaravangian whispered. “Please help me.”\nSzeth didn’t appear to have heard. He turned to go.\nNo! “Listen,” Taravangian said, going off script, ignoring the orders of\nhis smarter self. “Give Dalinar the sword. Dalinar is taken to Odium’s\nvision sometimes. It should travel with him. Do you understand? Odium\nthinks the sword is in Urithiru. He doesn’t realize you’re here. He can’t see\nit because of Renarin.”\nSmarter Taravangian claimed he didn’t want to work with Dalinar\nbecause it was too dangerous, or because Dalinar wouldn’t believe. Those\nlies made dumb Taravangian want to pound his fists at his own face out of\nshame. But the truth was more shameful.\nSzeth did not care which Taravangian he was speaking to. “I don’t\nunderstand your manipulations,” the man said as he walked away. “I should\nhave realized I wouldn’t be able to understand the way your mind works.\nAll I can do is refuse.”\nHe left, sending the other guard back to watch Taravangian—who stood\ngripping his little notebook, crying.\nEIGHT YEARS AGO\nVenli could hear new rhythms. She tried to hide this fact, attuning the old,\nboring rhythms around others. It was so difficult. The new rhythms were her\nmajesty, the proof that she was special. She wanted to shout them, flaunt\nthem.\nQuiet, Ulim said from her gemheart. Quiet for now, Venli. There will be\ntime enough later to enjoy the Rhythm of Praise.\nShe attuned Exultation, but did not hum it as she walked through the\nroom where her scholars worked. Ulim had given her hints about finding\nanother form, nimbleform. He wouldn’t tell her the exact process yet, so\nshe’d gathered these scholars and set them to work.\nOver time, she intended to use them as an excuse to reveal many\nimportant discoveries. Including ones that Ulim had promised her. Greater\nforms than these. Power.\nYou are special, Ulim whispered as she idled near a pair of her scholars\nwho were trying to trap a windspren that had flown in to tease them. I could\nsense you from far away, Venli. You were chosen by our god, the true god of\nall singers. He sent me to explain how wonderful you are.\nThe words comforted her. Yes. That was right. She would wear forms of\npower. Only … hadn’t she once wanted those … for her mother? Wasn’t\nthat the point?\nYou will be great, he said within her gemheart. Everyone will recognize\nyour majesty.\n“Well, I want nimbleform soon,” she whispered to Ulim, stepping out of\nthe chamber. “It has been too long since warform.

You should take time “finding”\nnimbleform. It will be too suspicious for you to find another so soon.\nShe folded her arms, listening to the new rhythm praise her. The city\nbuzzed with activity, thousands of listeners from a dozen families passing\nby. Eshonai and the others had made great strides toward true unity, and the\nelders of the various families were talking to one another.\nWho would get the glory for that? Venli had orchestrated this grand\nconvergence, but everyone ignored her.\nPerhaps she should have taken warform. Ulim had urged her to be one of\nthe first, but she’d hesitated. She hadn’t been frightened, no, but she’d\nassumed she could manipulate better without taking the form.\nThat had been a mistake, and this was her reward: Eshonai taking all the\ncredit. Next time, Venli would do it herself.\n“Ulim,” she whispered, “when will the other Voidspren be ready?”\nCan’t say for certain, he replied. That stupid Herald is still standing\nstrong all these years later. We have to work around him.\n“The new storm,” Venli whispered.\nYes. It’s been building in Shadesmar for centuries. We need to get our\nagents close enough to it on this side—a place that is out in the ocean, mind\nyou—so they can use gemstones to pull my brothers and sisters across.\nThen those stones have to be physically transported here. You have no idea\nhow much of a pain it all is.\n“I’m well acquainted by now,” she said to Derision. “You never shut up\nabout it.”\nHey, you’re the only one I get to talk to. And I like to talk. So …\n“Nimbleform. When?”\nWe have bigger problems. Your people aren’t ready to accept forms of\npower. At all. They’re far too timid. And the way they fight …\n“What’s wrong with the way we fight?” Venli asked to Conceit. “Our\nwarriors are powerful and intimidating.”\nPlease, Ulim replied. The humans have remembered how to make good\nsteel all these centuries, and even figured out some things we never learned.\nMeanwhile, your people throw spears at each other like primitives. They\nyell and dance more than they fight. It’s embarrassing.\n“Maybe you should have gone to the humans then.”\nDon’t be childish, Ulim said. You need to know what you’re facing.\nImagine a hundred thousand men in glistening armor, moving in\ncoordinated blocks, lifting a wall of interlocking shields—broken only by\nthe spears coming out to bite your flesh.\nImagine thousands upon thousands of archers loosing waves of arrows\nthat sweep in a deadly rain. Imagine men on horseback charging—thunder\nwithout lightning—and riding down anyone in their path. You think you can\nface that with a few semicoherent boasts?\nVenli’s confidence wavered. She looked out toward the Shattered Plains,\nwhere their warforms trained on a nearby plateau. She’d nudged them\ntoward that, following Ulim’s suggestions. He knew a lot about\nmanipulating people; with his help she could get the others to do pretty\nmuch anything."

He knew a lot about\nmanipulating people; with his help she could get the others to do pretty\nmuch anything.\nA part of her thought she should be concerned about that. But when she\ntried to think along those lines, her mind grew fuzzy. And she ended up\ncircling back to whatever she’d been thinking about before.\n“Eshonai guesses that the humans are bluffing about how many cities\nthey have,” she said. “But if they have dozens like they told us, then our\nnumbers would be roughly equal. If we can get all the families to listen to\nus.”\nRoughly equal? Ulim said, then started laughing. An outrageous sound,\nuproarious. It made her gemheart vibrate. You and them? Even? Oh, you\nblessed little idiot.\nVenli felt herself attune Agony. She hated the way he made her feel\nsometimes. He’d whisper about how great she was, but then they’d get deep\ninto a conversation and he’d speak more freely. More derogatorily.\n“Well,” she said, “maybe we don’t have to fight them. Maybe we can\nfind another way.”\nKid, you’re not gonna have a choice on that one, Ulim said. They will\nmake sure of it. You know what they’ve done to all the other singers in the\nworld? They’re slaves.\n“Yes,” Venli said. “Proof that my ancestors were wise in leaving.”\nYeah, please don’t say that around any of my friends, Ulim said. You’ll\nmake me look bad. Your ancestors were traitors. And no matter what you\ndo, the humans will make you fight. Trust me. It’s what they always do.\nYour primitive little paradise here is doomed. Best you can do is train\nsome soldiers, practice using the terrain to your advantage, and prepare to\nget some actual forms. You don’t get to choose to be free, Venli. Just which\nmaster to follow.\nVenli pushed off from the wall and began walking through the city.\nSomething was wrong about Ulim. About her. About the way she thought\nnow …\nYou have no idea the power that awaits you, Venli, Ulim said to the\nRhythm of Craving. In the old days, forms of power were reserved for the\nmost special. The most valuable. They were strong, capable of amazing\nfeats.\n“Then how did we ever lose?” she asked.\nBah, it was a fluke. We couldn’t break the last Herald, and the humans\nfound some way to pin the whole Oathpact on him. So we got stuck on\nBraize. Eventually the Unmade decided to start a war without us. That\nturned out to be exceedingly stupid. In the past, Odium granted forms of\npower, but Ba-Ado-Mishram thought she could do it. Ended up handing out\nforms of power as easily as Fused give each other titles, Connected herself\nto the entire singer species. Became a little god. Too little.\n“I … don’t understand.”\nI’ll bet you don’t. Basically, everyone relied way too much on an\noversized spren. Trouble is, spren can get stuck in gemstones, and the\nhumans figured this out. End result: Ba-Ado-Mishram got a really cramped\nprison, and everyone’s souls got seriously messed up."

End result: Ba-Ado-Mishram got a really cramped\nprison, and everyone’s souls got seriously messed up.\nIt will take something big to restore the minds of the singers around the\nworld. So we’re going to prime the pump, so to speak, with your people. Get\nthem into stormform and pull the big storm over from Shadesmar. Odium\nthinks it will work, and considering he’s anything but a little god, we are\ngoing to do what he says. It’s better than the alternative, which generally\ninvolves a lot of pain and the occasional flavorful dismemberment.\nVenli nodded to some listeners passing by. Members of another family;\nshe could tell by the colors of the bands on their braids and the type of\ngemstone bits in the men’s beards. Venli deliberately hummed one of the\nweak old rhythms for them to hear, but these newcomers didn’t give her a\nsecond glance despite her importance.\nPatience, Ulim said. Once the Return arrives, you will be proclaimed as\nthe one who initiated it—and you will be given everything you deserve as\nthe most important of all listeners.\n“You say my ancestors were traitors,” Venli whispered. “But you need\nus. If they hadn’t split off, you wouldn’t have us to use in your plot. You\nshould bless what they did.”\nThey got lucky. Doesn’t mean they weren’t traitors.\n“Perhaps they knew what Ba-Ado-Mishram was going to do, and so they\nattuned Wisdom, not Betrayal, in their actions.”\nShe knew the name, of course. As a keeper of songs, she knew the names\nof all nine Unmade—who were among the gods her people swore to never\nfollow again. But the more she talked with Ulim, the less regard she gave\nthe songs. The old listeners had memorized the wrong things. How could\nthey retain the names of the Unmade, but forget something as simple as\nhow to adopt workform?\nAnyway, who cares what your ancestors did? Ulim said. We need to\nprepare your people for forms of power, then get them to summon Odium’s\nstorm. Everything will take care of itself after that.\n“That might be harder than you think, spren,” Venli said to Derision. She\nquieted her voice as another group of listeners passed. The city was so\npacked these days, you could barely find any peace to think.\nForms of power, Venli. The ability to reshape the world. Strength beyond\nanything you’ve ever dreamed of having.\nShe stuffed her hands into the pockets of her robe as she reached the\nheart of the city. She hadn’t realized she was coming this way, to her\nfamily’s home. She stepped inside, and found her mother picking apart a\nrug she had woven. Jaxlim glanced up at Venli, jumping.\n“It’s only me,” Venli said to Peace.\n“I got it wrong again,” Jaxlim said, huddling over her rug. “Wrong every\ntime…”\nVenli tried to attune Indifference, one of the new rhythms, but she\ncouldn’t find it. Not here, not with her mother. She instead settled down on\nthe floor, cross-legged, like she’d sat as a child when learning the songs.\n“Mother?” Venli asked to Praise. “Everyone makes mistakes.”"

Days we once knew? Days of\n—”\n“Days of pain,” Jaxlim said, to the Rhythm of Memories. “Days of loss.\nDays of glory.”\nVenli nodded as Jaxlim continued. This song was more of a chant, the\noriginal recitation of her people leaving the war. Leaving their gods.\nStriking out on their own.\nThis is painful to hear, Ulim noted. Your people had no idea what they\nwere doing.\nVenli ignored him, listening, feeling the Rhythm of Memories.\nFeeling … like herself. This had all been about finding a way to help her\nmother, hadn’t it? At the start?\nNo, she admitted. That’s what you told yourself. But you want more.\nYou’ve always wanted more.\nShe knew forms changed the way a person thought. But was she in a\nnew form now? Ulim had been dodgy in explaining it. Evidently she had a\nnormal spren in her gemheart to give her workform—but Ulim was there\ntoo, crowding in. And he could speak to her, even hear what she was\nthinking.\nYou single-handedly delivered warform to your people, Ulim whispered.\nOnce you give them additional forms, they will revere you. Worship you.\nShe wanted that respect. She wanted it so badly. But she forced herself to\nlisten to what her ancestors had done, four hundred of them striking out\nalone, wearing dullform.\nThe fools were inbred, then, Ulim said. No wonder …\n“These people created us,” she whispered. Her mother continued\nsinging, and didn’t seem to have heard the interruption. “They were not\nfools. They were heroes. Their primary teaching, preserved in everything\nwe do, is to never let our gods rule us again. To never take up forms of\npower. To never serve Odium.”\nThen don’t serve him, Ulim said. Deal with him. You have something he\nneeds—you can approach him from a place of power. Your ancestors were\nlowly things; that was why they wanted to leave. If they’d been at the top,\nlike your people will be, they’d have never wanted such a thing.\nVenli nodded. But she was more persuaded by other arguments. War was\ncoming with the humans. She could feel it in the way their soldiers eyed her\npeople’s weapons. They had enslaved those parshmen. They’d do the same\nto Venli’s people.\nThe ancient songs had become irrelevant the moment Eshonai had led\nthe humans to the Shattered Plains. The listeners could no longer hide.\nConflict would find them. It was no longer a choice between their gods or\nfreedom. It was a choice between their gods and human slaving brands.\nHow do we proceed? Ulim asked.\nVenli closed her eyes, listening to her mother’s words. Her ancestors had\nbeen desperate. “We will need to be equally desperate,” Venli whispered."

Help me prove it.”\nI am your servant in this, Ulim said to Subservience. What do you\npropose?\nVenli listened. Jaxlim’s voice cracked and she trailed off. Jaxlim had\nforgotten the song again. The older femalen turned away and cried softly.\nIt broke Venli’s heart.\n“You have agents among the humans, Ulim?” Venli whispered.\nWe do.\n“Can you communicate with them?”\nI have ways of doing so.\n“Have your agents influence those at the palace,” Venli said. “Get the\nAlethi to invite us to visit. Their king spoke of it before he left; he’s\nconsidering it already. We must bring our people there, then show them how\npowerful the humans are. We must overwhelm my people with our own\ninsignificance.”\nShe stood up, then went to comfort her mother.\nWe must make them afraid, Ulim, Venli thought. We must make them sing\nto the Terrors long into the night. Only then will they listen to our promises.\nIt shall be done, he replied.\nWords.\nI used to be good with words.\nI used to be good at a lot of things.\nVenli tried to attune the Rhythm of Conceit as she walked the halls of\nUrithiru. She kept finding the Rhythm of Anxiety instead. It was difficult to\nattune an emotion she didn’t feel; doing so felt like a worse kind of lie than\nshe normally told. Not a lie to others, or to herself. A lie to Roshar.\nTimbre pulsed comfortingly. These were dangerous times, requiring\ndangerous choices.\n“That sounds an awful lot like the things Ulim told me,” Venli\nwhispered.\nTimbre pulsed again. The little spren was of the opinion that Venli\ncouldn’t be blamed for what she’d done, that the Voidspren had\nmanipulated her mind, her emotions, her goals.\nTimbre, for all her wisdom, was wrong in this. Ulim had heightened\nVenli’s ambitions, her arrogance, but she’d given him the tools to work\nwith. A part of her continued to feel some of those things. Worse, Ulim had\noccasionally left her gemheart during those days, and she’d still gone\nthrough with those plans, without his influence.\nShe might not bear full blame for what had happened. But she’d been a\nwilling part of it. Now she had to do her best to make up for it. So she kept\nher head high, walking as if she owned the tower, trailed by Rlain, who\ncarried the large crate as if on her orders. Everyone needed to see her\ntreating him as a servant; hopefully that would quash some of the rumors\nabout the two of them.\nHe hurried closer as they entered a less populated section of the tower.\n“The tower does feel darker now, Venli,” he said to the Rhythm of Anxiety\n—which didn’t help her own mood. “Ever since…”"

She knew what he’d been about to say: Ever since the\nfight in the market.\nThe whole tower knew by now that Kaladin Stormblessed, Windrunner\nand champion, fought. That his powers still functioned. The Fused had\nworked hard to spread a different narrative—that he’d been faking Radiant\npowers with fabrials, that he’d been killed during a cruel attack on innocent\nsinger civilians in the market.\nVenli found that story far-fetched, and she knew Stormblessed only by\nreputation. She doubted the propaganda would fool many humans. If\nRaboniel had been behind it, the message would have been more subtle.\nUnfortunately, the Lady of Wishes spent most of her time with her research,\nand instead let the Pursuer lead.\nHis personal troops dominated the tower. Already there had been a half\ndozen instances of singers beating humans near to death. This place was a\nsimmering cauldron, waiting for the added bit of fuel that would bring it to\na boil. Venli needed to be ready to get her people out when that happened.\nHopefully the crate Rlain carried would help with that.\nHead high. Hum to Conceit. Walk slowly but deliberately.\nBy the time they reached the Radiant infirmary, Venli’s nerves were so\ntight she could have played a rhythm on them. She shut the door after Rlain\n—they’d recently had it installed by some human workers—and finally\nattuned Joy.\nInside the infirmary, the human surgeon and his wife cared for the\ncomatose Radiants. They did a far better job of it than Venli’s staff; the\nsurgeon knew how to minimize the formation of sores on the humans’\nbodies and how to spot signs of dehydration.\nWhen Venli and Rlain entered, the surgeon’s wife—Hesina—hurried\nover. “Is this them?” she asked Rlain, helping him with the crate.\n“Nah, it’s my laundry,” he said to Amusement. “Figured Venli here is so\nmighty and important, she might be able to get someone to wash it for me.”\nJoking? Now? How could he act so indifferent? If they were discovered,\nit would mean their executions—or worse.\nThe human woman laughed. They carried the box to the back of the\nroom, away from the door. Hesina’s son put down the shoestrings he’d been\nplaying with and toddled over. Rlain ruffled his hair, then opened the crate.\nHe moved the decoy papers on top, revealing a group of map cases.\nHesina breathed out in a human approximation of the Rhythm of Awe.\n“After Kal and I parted,” Rlain explained, “and the queen surrendered, I\nrealized I could go anywhere in the tower. A little black ash mixed with\nwater covered my tattoo, blending it into my pattern. Humans were\nconfined to quarters, and so long as I looked like I was doing something\nimportant, the singers ignored me.\n“So I thought to myself, ‘What can I do to best undermine the"

I thought about sabotaging the wells,\nbut realized that would hurt too many innocents. I settled on this.”\nHe waved his hand over the round tubes filling the crate. Hesina took\none out and unrolled the map inside. It depicted the thirty-seventh floor of\nthe tower, meticulously mapped.\n“So far as I know,” Rlain said, “guard posts and master-servant quarters\njust contain maps of the lower floors. The upper-level maps were kept in\ntwo places: the queen’s information vault and the map room. I stopped by\nthe map room and found it burned out, likely at the queen’s order. The vault\nwas on the ground floor, far from where her troops could have reached. I\nfigured it might still be intact.”\nRlain shrugged a human shrug. “It was shockingly easy to get in,” he\ncontinued to Resolve. “The human guards had been killed or removed, but\nthe singers didn’t know the value of the place yet. I walked right through a\ncheckpoint, stuffed everything I could into a sack, and wandered out. I said\nI was on a search detail sent to collect any form of human writing.”\n“It was brave,” Lirin the surgeon said, stepping over and folding his\narms. “But I don’t know how useful it will be, Rlain. There’s not much\nthey’d want on the upper floors.”\n“It might help Kaladin stay hidden,” Rlain said.\n“Maybe,” Lirin said. “I worry you put yourself through an awful lot of\neffort and danger to accomplish what might add up to a mild inconvenience\nfor the occupation.”\nThe man was a pragmatist, which Venli appreciated. She, however, was\ninterested in other matters. “The tunnel complex,” she said. “Is there a map\nhere of the tunnels under the tower?”\nRlain dug for a moment, then pulled out a map. “Here,” he said. “Why?”\nVenli took it reverently. “It’s one of the few paths of escape, Rlain. I\ncame in through those tunnels—they’re a complicated maze. Raboniel\nknew her way through, but I doubt I could get us out on my own. But with\nthis…”\n“Didn’t the enemy collapse those tunnels?” Lirin asked.\n“Yes,” Venli said. “But I might have a way around that.”\n“Even if you do,” Lirin said, “we’d have to travel through the most\nheavily guarded section of the tower—where the Fused are doing their\nresearch on the tower fabrials.”\nYes, but could she use her powers to form a tunnel through the stone?\nOne that bypassed Raboniel’s workstation and the shield, then intersected\nwith these caverns below?\nPerhaps. Though there was still the greater problem. Before they could\nrun, she had to ensure the Fused wouldn’t give chase. Escaping the tower\nonly to die by a Heavenly One’s hand in the mountains would accomplish\nnothing.\n“Rlain,” Hesina said. “These are wonderful. You did more than anyone\ncould have expected of you.”"

I should have played dumb instead of using\nthe name of one I’d heard earlier in the day. Turns out that Fused doesn’t\nkeep a staff. She’s one of the lost ones.”\n“You could have locked yourself in a cell the moment the tower fell,”\nLirin said, “and pretended to be a prisoner. That way, the Fused could have\nliberated you, and no one would be suspicious.”\n“Every human in the tower knows about me, Lirin,” Rlain said. “The\n‘tame’ Parshendi your son ‘keeps.’ If I’d tried a ploy like that, the singers\nwould have found me eventually, and I’d have ended up in a cell for real.”\nHe shrugged again. “Did anyway though.”\nHe and Hesina began digging through the maps, Rlain chatting with\nthem as they did. He seemed to like these humans, and looked more\ncomfortable around them than he was with her. Beyond that, the way he\nused human mannerisms to exaggerate his emotions—the way the rhythms\nwere a subtle accent to his words, rather than the driving power behind\nthem—it all seemed a little … pathetic.\nLirin returned to his work tending the unconscious. Venli strolled over to\nhim, attuning Curiosity. “You don’t like what they’re doing,” Venli said,\nnodding toward the other two.\n“I’m undecided,” Lirin said. “My gut says that stealing a few maps\nwon’t hurt the occupation. But perhaps if we turned the maps in and\nclaimed we found them in a forgotten room, there’s a good chance it would\nearn us favor with the Fused. Perhaps it would prove Hesina and I aren’t\nmalcontents, so we could come out of hiding.”\n“It isn’t the hiding that protects you,” Venli said, “it is Lady Leshwi’s\nfavor. Without it, the Pursuer would kill you, no matter what you did to\nprove yourself. He’d kill other Fused, if he thought it would let him fulfill\nhis tradition. And the others would applaud him.”\nLirin grunted—a human version of Derision, she thought—as he knelt\nbeside a Radiant and lifted her eyelids to check her eyes. “Nice to know\nyour government has its idiocies too.”\n“You really don’t want to resist, do you?” Venli said to Awe. “You truly\nwant to live with the occupation.”\n“I resist by controlling my situation,” Lirin said. “And by working with\nthose in power, rather than giving them reason to hurt me and mine. It’s a\nlesson I learned very painfully. Fetch me some water.”\nVenli was halfway to the water station before she realized she’d done\nwhat he said, despite telling him—several times—that he needed to show\nher more respect. What a strange man. His attitude was so commanding and\nin charge, but he used it to reinforce his own subservience."

His attitude was so commanding and\nin charge, but he used it to reinforce his own subservience.\nTimbre thrummed as Venli returned to him with the water. She needed to\npractice her powers some more—particularly if she might be required to\ntunnel them down through many feet of rock to reach an exit. She took the\ntunnel map and gave it to Jial, one of her loyalists. Jial folded it and placed\nit into her pocket as a knock sounded at the door.\nVenli glanced toward Rlain and Hesina, but they’d apparently heard, for\nthey covered up the crate of maps. It still looked suspicious to Venli, but she\nwent to the door anyway. Fused wouldn’t knock.\nAccordingly, she opened the door and let in a group of humans who bore\nwater jugs on poles across their shoulders. Six workers—the same ones as\nalways. That was good, for although Venli had permission from Raboniel to\nbring a human surgeon in to care for the fallen Radiants, she had lied in\nsaying she’d gone to the clinic to recruit him.\nEventually, Lirin and Hesina would be recognized—but best to limit\ntheir exposure to as few people as possible. The water carriers delivered\ntheir burdens to the room’s large troughs, then helped with the daily\nwatering of the patients. It demanded near-constant work to give broth and\ndrink to so many unconscious people.\nVenli checked the time by the Rhythm of Peace. She needed to visit\nRaboniel for translation duty soon—there were books in Thaylen that the\nLady of Wishes wanted read to her.\nShe doesn’t care about anything other than her research, Venli thought.\nWhat could be so important?\n“You there,” Lirin said. “What is that on your head?”\nVenli turned to find the surgeon confronting one of the water bearers.\nLirin pushed back the hair on the man’s head and pointed. She hummed to\nIrritation—the surgeon was generally calm, but once in a while something\nset him off. She strode over to settle the situation, to find that the water\nbearer—a short man with far too much hair on his body—had painted his\nforehead with some kind of ink.\n“What is that?” Venli asked.\n“Nothing, Brightness,” the man said, pulling out of Lirin’s grip. “Just a\nlittle reminder.” He moved on, but one of the other water carriers—a female\nthis time—had a similar marking on her forehead.\n“It’s a shash glyph,” Lirin said.\nAs soon as Venli knew it was writing, her powers interpreted it.\n“Dangerous? Why do they think they’re dangerous?”\n“They don’t,” Lirin said—wearing his upset emotions on his face.\n“They’re fools.”\nHe turned to go, but Venli caught him by the arm and hummed to\nCraving. Which of course he couldn’t understand. So she asked, “What\ndoes it mean?”\n“It’s the brand on … on the forehead of Kaladin Stormblessed.”\nAh … “He gives them hope.”\n“That hope is going to get them killed,” Lirin said, lowering his voice."

My son may have gotten himself killed resisting them.\nHeralds send it isn’t true, but his example is going to cause trouble. Some of\nthese might get the terrible idea of following in his steps, and that will\ninevitably provoke a massacre.”\n“Maybe,” Venli said, letting him go. Timbre pulsed to an unfamiliar\nrhythm that echoed in her mind. What was it? She could swear she’d never\nheard it before. “Or maybe they simply need something to keep them going,\nsurgeon. A symbol they can trust when they can’t trust their own hearts.”\nThe surgeon shook his head and turned away from the water carriers,\ninstead focusing on his patients.\nThere was a time when others would approach me for help with a\nproblem. A time when I was decisive. Capable. Even authoritative.\nIt was a crystalline day in Shadesmar as Adolin—guarded as always by two\nhonorspren soldiers—climbed to the top of the walls of Lasting Integrity.\nDuring his weeks incarcerated in the fortress, he’d discovered that there\nwere weather patterns in Shadesmar. They just weren’t the same type as in\nthe Physical Realm.\nWhen he reached the top of the wall, he could see a faint shimmer in the\nair. It was only visible if you could look a long distance. A kind of violet-\npink haze. Crystalline, they called it. On days like these, plants in\nShadesmar grew quickly enough to see the change with your eyes.\nOther types of “weather” involved spren feeling invigorated or dreary, or\ncertain types of smaller spren getting more agitated. It was never about\ntemperature or precipitation.\nFrom the top of the wall, he could really get a sense of the fortress’s size.\nLasting Integrity was enormous, several hundred feet tall. It was also\nhollow, and had no roof. Rectangular and resting on the small side, all four\nof its walls were perfectly sheer, without windows. No human city would\never have been built this way; even Urithiru needed fields at its base and\nwindows to keep the people from going mad.\nBut Lasting Integrity didn’t follow normal laws of nature. You could\nwalk on the interior walls. Indeed, to reach the top, Adolin had strolled\nvertically up the inside of the fortress wall. His body thought he had been\nwalking on the ground. However, at the end of the path, he’d reached the\nbattlements. Getting onto them had required stepping off what seemed to be\nthe edge of the ground.\nAs he’d done so, gravity had caught his foot, then propelled him over so\nhe was now standing at the very top of the fortress. He felt vertigo as he\nglanced down along a wall he’d recently treated as the ground. In fact, he\ncould see all the way to the floor hundreds of feet below.\nThinking about it gave him a headache. So he looked outward across the\nlandscape. And the view … the view was spectacular. Lasting Integrity"

And the view … the view was spectacular. Lasting Integrity\noverlooked a sea of churning beads lit by the cold sun so they shimmered\nand sparkled, an entire ocean of captured stars. Huge swells washed through\nthe bay and broke into crashing falls of tumbling beads.\nIt was mesmerizing, made all the more interesting by the lights that\ncongregated and moved in the near distance. Tukar and the people who\nlived there, reflected in the Cognitive Realm.\nThe other direction had its own less dramatic charms. Rocky obsidian\nshores gave way to growing forests of glass, lifespren bobbing among the\ntrees. Lifespren were larger here, though still small enough that he wouldn’t\nhave been able to see them save for the bright green glow they gave off.\nThese lights blinked off and on, a behavior that seemed unique to this\nregion of Shadesmar. Watching, Adolin could swear there was a\ncoordination to their glows. They’d blink in rippling waves, synchronized.\nAs if to a beat.\nHe took it in for a moment. The view wasn’t why he’d come, however.\nNot fully. Once he’d spent time drinking in the beauty, he scanned the\nnearby coast.\nTheir camp was still there, tucked away a short walk into the highlands,\nnearer the trees. Godeke, Felt, and Malli waited for the results of his trial.\nWith some persuasion, the honorspren had allowed Godeke to come in,\ngiven him a little Stormlight, and let him heal Adolin’s wound. The\nhonorspren had expelled Godeke soon after, but permitted Adolin to\ncommunicate with his team via letters.\nThey’d traded—with his permission—a few of his swords to a passing\ncaravan of Reachers for more food and water. Non-manifested weapons\nwere worth a lot in Shadesmar. The Stump, Zu, and the rest of Adolin’s\nsoldiers had left to bring word to his father. Though Adolin had initially\nanticipated a quick and dramatic end to his incarceration, the honorspren\nhadn’t wanted an immediate trial. He should have realized the punctilious\nspren would want time to prepare.\nThough aspects of the delay were frustrating, the wait favored him. The\nlonger he spent among the honorspren, the more chance he had to persuade\nthem. Theoretically. So far, the spren of this fortress seemed about as easy\nto persuade as rocks.\nOne other oddity was visible from this high perch. Gathering on the\ncoast nearby was an unusual group of spren. It had begun about two weeks\nago as a few scattered individuals, but those numbers grew each day. At this\npoint, there had to be two hundred of them. They stood on the coast all\nhours of the day, motionless, speechless.\nDeadeyes.\n“Storms,” said Vaiu. “There are so many.”\nVaiu was Adolin’s primary jailer for excursions like this.

With his winged spear, he\nseemed like a depiction of a Herald from some ancient painting.\n“What happened to the ones you let in?” Adolin asked.\n“We put them with the others,” Vaiu explained. “Everything about them\nseems normal, for deadeyes. Though we don’t have space left for more. We\nnever expected…” He shook his head. There were no lights of souls near\nthose deadeyes; this wasn’t a gathering of Shardbearers in the Physical\nRealm. The deadeyes were moving of their own accord, coming up from the\ndepths to stand out here. Silent. Watching.\nThe fortress had quarters for deadeyes. Though Adolin had little love for\nthese honorspren and their stubbornness, he had to admit there was honor in\nthe way they treated fallen spren. The honorspren had dedicated themselves\nto finding and caring for as many as they could. Though they’d taken Maya\nand put her in with the others, they let Adolin visit her each morning to do\ntheir exercises together. While they wouldn’t let her wander free, she was\ntreated quite well.\nBut what would they do with so many? The honorspren had taken in the\nfirst group, but as more and more deadeyes arrived, the fortress had\nreluctantly shut its gates to them.\n“It doesn’t make any sense,” Vaiu said. “They should all be wandering\nthe oceans, not congregating here. What provoked this behavior?”\n“Has anyone tried asking them?” Adolin asked.\n“Deadeyes can’t talk.”\nAdolin leaned forward. Around his hands on the railing, pink crystal fuzz\nbegan to grow: the Shadesmar version of moss, spreading because of the\ncrystalline day.\nThe distance was too great for him to distinguish one scratched-out face\nfrom another. However, he did notice when one vanished into mist. Those\nspren were Shardblades—hundreds of them, more than he’d known existed.\nWhen their owners summoned them, their bodies evaporated from\nShadesmar. Why were they here? Deadeyes usually tried to keep close to\ntheir owners, wandering through the ocean of beads.\n“There is a Connection happening,” Vaiu said. “Deadeyes cannot think,\nbut they are still spren—bound to the spiritweb of Roshar herself. They can\nfeel what is happening in this keep, that justice will finally be\nadministered.”\n“If you can call it justice,” Adolin said, “to punish a man for what his\nancestors did.”\n“You are the one who suggested this course, human,” Vaiu said. “You\ntook their sins upon you. This trial cannot possibly make remediation for\nthe thousands murdered, but the deadeyes sense what is happening here.”\nAdolin glanced at his other guard, Alvettaren. She wore a breastplate and\na steel cap—both formed from her substance, of course—above close-\ncropped hair. As usual she stared forward, her lips closed.

Lasting Integrity was built like\na storming monolith, a stupid brick of a building with no windows. It was\nimpossible to feel anything other than trapped while inside these walls.\nBut that wasn’t the worst of it. The worst was how honorspren had no\nrespect whatsoever for the laws of nature. Veil opened the door from the\nsmall building she shared with Adolin, looking out at what seemed to be an\nordinary street. A walkway of worked stone led from her front door and\npassed by several other small buildings before dead-ending at a wall.\nHowever, as soon as she stepped out, her brain started to panic. Another\nflat surface of stone hung in the air above her, instead of the sky. It was\nclustered with its own buildings—and people, mostly honorspren, walked\nalong its pathways. To her left and right were two other surfaces, much the\nsame.\nThe actual sky was behind her. She was walking on the inside surface of\none of the walls of the fortress. It squeezed her mind, making her tremble.\nShallan, Veil thought, you should be leading. You’d like the way this place\nlooks.\nShallan did not respond. She huddled deep within, refusing to emerge.\nEver since they’d discovered that Pattern had been lying to them, probably\nfor years, she had become increasingly reclusive. Veil was able to coax her\nout now and then, but lately something … dangerous had come with her.\nSomething they were calling Formless.\nVeil wasn’t certain it was a new persona. If it wasn’t, would that be even\nworse?\nVeil let Radiant take over. Radiant wasn’t so bothered by the strange\ngeometry, and she took off down the path without feeling vertigo—though\neven she had trouble sometimes. The worst parts were the strange halfway\nzones at the corners where each plane met, where you had to step from one\nwall to another. The honorspren did it easily, but Radiant’s stomach did\nsomersaults every time she had to.\nShallan, Radiant thought, you should sketch this place. We should carry\ndrawings with us when we leave.\nNothing.\nHonorspren liked to keep the hour exactly, so the bells told Radiant she\nwas on time as she turned up the side of the wall toward the sky, passing\nvarious groups of spren going about their business. This wall of the fortress\n—the southern plane—was the most beautified, with gardens of crystalline\nplants of a hundred different varieties.\nFountains somehow flowed here, the only free water Radiant had seen in\nShadesmar. She passed one fountain that surged and fell in powerful spouts;\nif a spray got beyond about fifteen feet high, the water would suddenly\nbreak off the top and stream down toward the actual ground rather than\nback toward the wall plane. Storms, this place didn’t make any kind of\nsense.\nRadiant turned away from the fountain and tried to focus on the people"

Storms, this place didn’t make any kind of\nsense.\nRadiant turned away from the fountain and tried to focus on the people\nshe was passing. She hadn’t expected to find anyone other than honorspren\nin here, considering how strict the fortress was, but apparently its\nxenophobic policy had only been instituted a year ago. Any other people\nthen living inside the fortress were allowed to stay, though they’d be\nforbidden reentry if they left.\nThat meant ambassadorial delegations from the other spren nations—as\nwell as some tradespeople and random wanderers—had been grandfathered\ninto the honorspren lockdown. Most importantly, seventeen humans lived\nhere.\nWithout direction from Shallan, and with the honorspren taking their\ntime preparing their trial, Radiant and Veil had reached a compromise.\nThey’d find Restares, the person Mraize had sent them to locate. They\nwouldn’t take any actions against him unless they could get Shallan to\ndecide, but Radiant was perfectly willing to locate him. This man, the\nphantom leader of the Sons of Honor, was a key part of this entire puzzle—\nand she was intensely curious why Mraize wanted him so badly.\nRestares was, according to Mraize, a human male. Radiant carried a\ndescription of the man in her pocket, though none of the honorspren Veil\nhad asked knew the name. And unfortunately, the description was rather\nvague. A shorter human with thinning hair. Mraize said Restares was a\nsecretive type, and would likely be using an alias and perhaps a disguise.\nHe was supposedly paranoid, which made perfect sense to Radiant.\nRestares led a group of people who had worked to restore the singers and\nthe Fused. The coming of the Everstorm had led to the fall of multiple\nkingdoms, the deaths of thousands, and the enslavement of millions. The\nSons of Honor were deplorable for seeking these things. True, it wasn’t\nclear their efforts had in fact influenced the Return, but she could\nunderstand why they wanted to hide.\nUpon first entering the fortress, she’d asked to be introduced to the other\nhumans residing in the place. In response, the honorspren had given her the\nfull list of all humans living here. With limited locations to search, she’d\nassumed her task would be easy. Indeed, it had started out that way. She’d\nstarted with the largest group of people: a caravan of traders from a\nkingdom called Nalthis, a place out in the darkness beyond the edges of the\nmap. Veil had chatted with them at length, discovering that Azure—who\nhad moved on from the fortress by now—was from the same land.\nRadiant had trouble conceptualizing what it meant for there to be\nkingdoms out away from the continent. Did Azure’s people live on islands\nin the ocean?\nNo, Veil thought. We’re avoiding the truth, Radiant. It means something\nelse. Like Mraize told us. Those people came from another land. Another\nworld.\nRadiant’s mind reeled at the thought. She took a deep breath, slowing\nnear a group of trees—real ones from the Physical Realm, kept alive with\nStormlight instead of sunlight—that were the centerpieces of this park. The"

The\ntops were so high that when leaves fell off, they drifted down toward the\nreal ground, through the middle of the fortress.\nShallan, Radiant thought. You could come and talk to people from other\nworlds. This is too big for Veil and me.\nShallan stirred, but as she did, that darkness moved with her. She quickly\nretreated.\nLet’s focus on today’s mission, Radiant, Veil said.\nRadiant agreed, and forced Veil to emerge. She could handle the strange\ngeography; she had to. She put her head down and continued. None of the\ntravelers from Nalthis looked like Restares, or seemed likely to be him in\ndisguise. The next handful on her list had been Horneaters; apparently there\nwas a clan of them who lived in Shadesmar. She’d doubted any were\nRestares, but she’d interviewed each of them just in case.\nThat done, Veil had been left with five people. Four turned out to be\nwanderers. None had been open about their pasts, but over the weeks she’d\nmet with them one by one. After conversing with each, she had reported on\nthem to Mraize. He had eliminated each of those as possibilities.\nNow, only a single name remained on her list. This person was the most\nreclusive of them all—but was male, and the descriptions of him from the\nhonorspren indicated that he was probably her quarry. Today she would\nfinally catch a glimpse of him. With the subject confirmed she could call\nMraize, find out what message she was supposed to deliver to Restares,\nthen be done with this mission.\nThe target called himself “Sixteen.” He supposedly came out of his\nhome once every sixteen days exactly—the regularity of it amused the\nhonorspren, who suffered the odd fellow because of the novelty. No one\nknew how he survived without food, and no one reported a terrible stench\nor anything like that from him—though he didn’t ever seem to bathe or\nempty a chamber pot. Indeed, the more she’d learned about him, the more\nVeil was certain this mysterious man was her target.\nHis home was a small box built near the statue garden. Veil had made a\nhabit of visiting this garden, where she tried to coax Shallan out by\ndrawing. It worked occasionally, though Shallan usually retreated after a\nhalf hour or so of sketching.\nToday, Veil curled up on a bench with a sketchpad, coat enveloping her,\nhat shading her eyes. Today was the day that Sixteen would emerge,\nassuming he followed his pattern. All she had to do was wait and not act\nsuspicious.\nShallan, Veil said, opening the sketchbook. See? It’s time to draw.\nShallan started to emerge. Unfortunately, a faint humming sound made\nher panic and Veil was thrust back into control. She sighed, glancing to the\nside—to where Pattern walked among the statues, which she’d been told\nwere of honorspren killed in the Recreance.

How odd that they’d made these; after all, the real individuals\nwere still around, though deadeyed.\nPattern bobbed over to her. He was easy to tell from other Cryptics; he\nhad an excitable spring to his step, while others slunk or crept, more furtive.\n“I thought you were watching the Nalthians today,” Veil said.\n“I was!” he said, plopping down on the bench beside her. “But Veil, I do\nnot think any of them are Restares. They do not look like him at all. They\ndo not even look like people from Roshar. Why do you think Azure\nappeared so much like an Alethi, when these have the wrong features?”\n“Don’t know,” Veil said, pretending to sketch. “But this Restares could\nbe using something like Lightweaving. I need you to watch them carefully.”\n“I am sorry,” Pattern said, his pattern slowing, like a wilting plant. “I\nmiss being with you.”\nYou’re worried you’ll miss something important, traitor, Shallan thought.\nAnd want an excuse to keep spying on me.\nVeil sighed again. She reached over and put her hand on Pattern’s. He\nhummed softly.\nWe need to confront him, Radiant thought. We need to find out exactly\nwhy he is lying.\nVeil wasn’t so certain. It was all growing so messy. Pattern, Shallan’s\npast, the mission they were on. She needed Shallan to remember. That\nwould solve so much.\nWait, Radiant thought. Veil, what do you know? What do you remember\nthat I do not?\n“Veil?” Pattern asked. “Can I talk to Shallan?”\n“I can’t force her to emerge, Pattern,” Veil said. Stormwinds; she\nsuddenly felt so tired. “We can try later, if you want. For now, Sixteen is\ngoing to come out of that house in a few minutes. I need to be ready to\nintercept him in a way that reveals his face, but doesn’t make him\nsuspicious of me.”\nPattern hummed. “Do you remember,” he said softly, “when we first met\non the boat? With Jasnah? Mmm … You jumped in the water. She was so\nshocked.”\n“Nothing shocks Jasnah.”\n“That did. I barely remember—I was so new to your realm.”\n“That wasn’t the first time we met though,” Radiant said, sitting up\nstraighter. “Shallan had spoken oaths before, after all. She had a\nShardblade.”\n“Yes.” If he had been human, his posture would have been described as\nunnaturally still. Hands clasped, seated primly. His pattern moved,\nexpanding, contracting, rotating upon itself. Like an explosion.\n“I think,” he finally said, “we have been doing this wrong, Radiant. I\nonce tried to help Shallan remember, and that was painful for her. Too\npainful. So I started to think it was good for her not to remember. And the\nlies were delicious. Nothing is better than a lie with so much truth.”"

Did you know she was going to do something\nthat drastic?”\n“I … don’t remember,” Pattern said.\n“How can you not remember?” Radiant pressed.\nHe remained quiet. Radiant frowned, considering the lies she’d caught\nhim in during the last few weeks.\n“Why did you want to bond a human, Pattern?” Radiant found herself\nasking. “In the past, you’ve seemed so certain that Shallan would kill you.\nYet you bonded her anyway. Why?”\nThis is a dangerous line of questioning, Radiant, Veil warned. Be careful.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said, humming to himself. “Why. So many answers to\na why. You want the truest one, but any such truth is also a lie, as it pretends\nto be the only answer.” He tipped his head to the right, looking toward the\nsky—though so far as she knew, he didn’t “see” forward, as he didn’t have\neyes. He seemed to sense all around him.\nShe glanced in the same direction. Colors shimmered in the sky. It was a\ncrystalline day.\n“You and the others,” Pattern said, “refer to Shadesmar as the world of\nthe spren, and the Physical Realm as ‘your’ world. Or the ‘real’ world. That\nis not true. We are not two worlds, but one. And we are not two peoples, but\none. Humans. Spren. Two halves. Neither complete.\n“I wanted to be in the other realm. See that part of our world. And I\nknew danger was coming. All spren could sense it. The Oathpact was no\nlonger working correctly. Voidspren were sneaking onto Roshar, using some\nkind of back door. Two halves cannot fight this enemy. We need to be\nwhole.”\n“And if Shallan killed you?”\n“Mmm. I was sure you would. But together, we Cryptics thought we\nneeded to try. And I volunteered. I thought, maybe even if I die it will be the\nstep other spren need. You cannot reach the end of a proof without many\nsteps in the middle, Shallan. I was to be the middle step.” He turned toward\nher. “I no longer believe you will kill me. Or perhaps I wish to no longer\nbelieve you will kill me. Ha ha.”\nRadiant wanted to believe. She wanted to know.\nThis will lead to pain, Veil warned.\n“Can I trust you, Pattern?” Radiant asked.\n“Any answer will be a lie,” he said. “I cannot see the future like our\nfriend Renarin. Ha ha.”\n“Pattern, have you lied to us?”\nHis pattern wilted. “… Yes.”\nRadiant took a deep breath. “And have you been spying on us? Have you\nbeen using the cube Mraize gave us, in secret?”\n“I’m sorry, Radiant,” he said softly. “I couldn’t think of another way.”"

We should have asked him\nright away, Veil.\nIt was only then that she noticed, deep inside, that Shallan was seething.\nTwisting about herself, trembling, fuming, alternating between terror and\nanger.\nThat … didn’t seem good.\nPattern’s pattern swirled small and tight. “I try to be worthy of trust. That\nis not a lie. But I have brought someone for Shallan to meet. I think it is\nimportant.”\nHe stood with a smooth inhuman motion, then gestured behind him with\none long-fingered hand. Radiant frowned and glanced over her shoulder.\nLeaves from the trees farther up the plane lazily drifted down the central\ncorridor. A faint shimmer dusted the air, and a small crystal tree started to\ngrow in miniature on the bench beside her hand.\nStanding near a statue behind them was a dark figure wearing a stiff\nrobe. Like Pattern’s, but dustier. And a head trapped in shadow. Twisted and\nwrong.\nDamnation, Veil thought.\nShallan emerged. She grabbed Radiant, shoved her away someplace dark\nand small, and slammed the door shut.\nShallan … Veil thought, then her voice crumpled. She should remain\nsectioned away. In the past, they hadn’t talked to one another this way.\nThey’d simply taken turns being in control, as they were needed.\nShallan was in control. The other two became whispers. “No,” she said\nto Pattern. “We are not doing this.”\n“But—” he said.\n“NO,” she said. “I want nothing from you, Pattern. You are a traitor and\na liar. You have betrayed my trust.”\nHe wilted, flopping onto the bench. Shallan saw movement from the\ncorner of her eye and spun, her heart thundering in her ears. The small\nbuilding she’d come here to watch—Sixteen’s home—had opened, and a\nfurtive figure had emerged. Hunched over, face hidden in the cowl of a\ncloak, the figure hurried through the statue park.\nExcellent. It was time to fulfill Mraize’s mission.\nShallan … Veil whispered.\nShe ignored the voice and settled down on the bench, acting nonchalant\nas she opened her notebook. Veil’s plan had included wandering through the\nstatue park, idly flipping through her notebook, then bumping into Sixteen\n—hopefully getting a good look at his face.\nUnfortunately, Shallan wasn’t in position yet to do that. She’d been\ndistracted by Pattern and his lies. She stood and meandered toward the\nstatue garden, trying to appear nonthreatening. She needed to determine for\ncertain that Sixteen was her target. Then …\nThen what.\nKill him.\nWhat are you doing? Veil thought. Such a distant, annoying voice.\nCouldn’t she quiet it entirely?\nYou were the one who wanted to go forward with Mraize’s plan, Shallan\nthought. Well, I agree. So two of us have decided."

So two of us have decided.\nI wanted to gather information, Veil thought. I wanted to use it against\nhim. Why are you suddenly so aggressive?\nBecause this was exactly who Shallan was. Who she’d always been. She\nstalked toward the statue garden. Radiant was, of course, screaming and\nrailing at her—but she was outvoted.\nShallan had been watching and learning these last months, and she’d\npicked up some things from Veil. She knew to get into Sixteen’s blind spot,\nthen stop and appear like she was sketching a statue—so when he turned to\nglance around, she seemed unremarkable.\nShe knew to glide forward when he turned away. She knew to step\ncarefully, putting the heel of her foot down first and rolling toward the toe.\nShe knew to walk on the sides of her feet as much as possible, not letting\nthe flats slap.\nShe got right up behind Sixteen as he hunched over, fiddling with some\nnotes. She grabbed him by the shoulder, then spun him around. His hood\nfell, revealing his face.\nHe was Shin; there was no mistaking that pale, almost sickly skin and\nthose childlike eyes. Restares was a short Alethi man with wispy hair. This\nman was short, yes, but completely bald, and was not Alethi. So unless\nMraize was wrong and Restares was a Lightweaver, this was not her man.\nHe shouted and said something to her in a language she didn’t recognize.\nShe released him, and he fled toward his home. Her heart thumping in her\nchest, she pulled her hand out of the satchel. She hadn’t even realized she’d\nreached into that, for a weapon.\nShe didn’t need it. This wasn’t him.\nPattern walked up, having recovered some of his characteristic\nperkiness. There was no sign of the other spren he’d wanted her to meet.\n“Well!” he said. “That was exciting. But this is not him, is it?”\n“No,” Shallan said. “It’s not.”\n“Shallan, I need to explain to you. What I’ve been doing.”\n“No,” Shallan said, covering her pain. “It is done. Let’s move forward\ninstead.”\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “I … What has happened to you? Something has\nchanged. Are you … Veil?”\n“No,” Shallan said. “I’m me. And I’ve finally made a difficult decision\nthat was a long time coming. Come on, we need to report to Mraize. His\nintel was wrong—Restares is not in this fortress.”\nSuch skills, like my honor itself, are now lost to time. Weathered away,\ncrushed to dust, and scattered to the ends of the cosmere.

Simply another pattern in the strata.\nThe soul of Urithiru had been watching her all along. Perhaps if Navani\nhad discovered it sooner, they could have achieved a different result.\nShe replaced her hand on the vein. “I’m sorry,” she whispered. “Please\nknow that I’m sorry. Truly.”\nFor the briefest moment, she thought the Sibling would respond this\ntime. Navani felt something, faint as the movement of a shadow deep\nwithin the ocean. No words came.\nWith a sigh, Navani left the crystal vein and wound her way through the\nshelves of the small library to reach her desk beside the door. Today, in\naddition to the guard, Raboniel’s daughter—with the topknot and the vacant\neyes—sat on the floor right inside.\nNavani settled onto her seat, trying to ignore the insane Fused. Notes and\nhalf-finished experiments cluttered her desk. She didn’t have the least bit of\ninterest in continuing them. Why would she? Everything she’d attempted so\nfar had been a sham. She wrote out her daily instructions to the scholars—\nshe was having them perform tests on Voidspren fabrials, which Raboniel\nhad delivered before everything went wrong. She gave this to a messenger,\nthen sat there staring.\nEventually Raboniel herself made an appearance, wearing an Alethi\nhavah that fit her surprisingly well. Clearly a good dressmaker had tailored\nit to the Fused’s taller, more broad-shouldered frame. One might have\nthought her form would make her unfeminine, particularly with the\nunpronounced bust common to most singer femalens. Instead—with the\nexcellent cut and the confidence of her stride—Raboniel wore the dress as if\nit had always been designed to accentuate someone of height, power, and\npoise. She had made this fashion her own. Adolin would have approved.\nAt least he was safe. Adolin, Renarin, Jasnah, Dalinar, and little Gav. Her\nentire family safe from the invasion and the mess Navani had made. It was\none small blessing she could thank the Almighty for sending her.\nRaboniel had brought a stool—a low one, so that when she sat on it, she\nwas at eye level with Navani. The Fused set a basket on the floor, then\npulled out a bottle of burgundy wine. A Shin vintage, sweeter than\ntraditional Alethi wines, known as an amosztha—a Shin wine made from\ngrapes.\n“Your journals,” Raboniel said, “indicate you are fond of this vintage.”\n“You read my journals?” Navani said.\n“Of course,” Raboniel said, setting out two glasses. “You would have\nwisely done the same in my position.” She uncorked the bottle and poured\nhalf a cup for Navani.\nShe didn’t drink. Raboniel didn’t force her, instead inspecting the wine\nwith an expert eye, then taking a sip. “Ah, yes,” she said. “That is a taste\ninfused with memory. Grapes. Your ancestors never could get them to live"

Too cold, I believe. Or perhaps it was the lack of soil. I\nfound that explanation odd, as grapevines seem similar to many of our\nnative plants.\n“I wasn’t there when your kind came to our world. My grandmother,\nhowever, always mentioned the smoke. At first she thought you had strange\nskin patterns—but that was because so many human faces had been burned\nor marked by soot from the destruction of the world they left behind.\n“She talked about the way your livestock moaned and cried from their\nburns. The result of humans Surgebinding without oaths, without checks.\nOf course, that was before any of us understood the Surges. Before the\nspren left us for you, before the war started.”\nNavani felt the hair go up on the back of her neck as she listened.\nStorms. This creature … she had lived during the shadowdays, the time\nbefore history. They had no primary accounts of those days. Yet one sat\nbefore her, drinking wine from Navani’s secret stash, musing about the\norigins of humanity.\n“So long ago,” Raboniel said, with a soft, almost indistinguishable\ncadence to her words. “So very, very long ago. What has it been? Seven\nthousand years? I don’t think you can comprehend how tired I am of this\nwar, Navani. How tired all of us are. Your Heralds too.”\n“Then let’s end it,” Navani said. “Declare peace. Withdraw from the\ntower and I will convince Dalinar to engage in talks.”\nRaboniel turned her wine cup around, as if trying to see the liquid within\nfrom different angles. “You think talks haven’t been tried? We are born to\nfight one another, Navani. Opposites. At least so I thought. I always\nassumed that if Stormlight and Voidlight could be forced to truly mix,\nthen … poof, they’d annihilate one another. Much as we’re doing to one\nanother in this endless war…”\n“Is that what this is all about?” Navani asked. “Why you want me to\ncombine the Lights so badly?”\n“I need to know if you’re right,” Raboniel said. “If you are, then so\nmuch of what I’ve planned will collapse. I wonder … whether sometimes I\ncan’t see clearly anymore. Whether I assume what I want to be true is true.\nYou live long enough, Navani, and you forget to be careful. You forget to\nquestion.”\nRaboniel nodded toward Navani’s desk. “No luck today?”\n“No interest,” Navani said. “I think it is time for me to accept your initial\noffer and start carrying water.”\n“Why waste yourself like that?” Raboniel asked, her rhythm becoming\nintense. “Navani, you can still defeat me. If it wasn’t possible for humans to\noutthink the Fused, you’d have fallen during the first few Returns. The first\nfew Desolations, as you call them.\n“Instead you always pushed us back.

My kind pretends we know so much, but during many Returns,\nwe’d find ourselves struggling to catch up to your kind. That is our terrible\nsecret. We hear the rhythms, we understand Roshar and the spren. But the\nrhythms don’t change. The spren don’t change.\n“If you and I discover this secret together, you’ll be able to use it better\nthan I will. Watch and see. At the very least, prove me wrong. Show me that\nour two Lights can meld and mix as you theorize.”\nNavani considered it, though storms, she knew she shouldn’t have. It\nwas another trick—another catalyst added to the system to push the reaction\nforward. Yet Navani couldn’t lie to herself. She did want to know. As\nalways, questions teased her. Questions were disorder awaiting\norganization. The more you understood, the more the world aligned. The\nmore the chaos made sense, as all things should.\n“I’ve run into a problem,” Navani said, finally taking a sip from her cup.\n“I can make the two Lights intersect—I can get them to pool around the\nsame gemstone, swirling out like smoke caught in a current of air. But they\nwon’t mix.”\n“Opposites,” Raboniel said, leaning forward to look at the diagrams and\nnotes Navani had made on each failed attempt.\n“No, merely inert substances,” Navani said. “The vast majority of\nelements, when combined, produce no reaction. I’d have long ago named\nthese two things immiscible if I hadn’t seen Towerlight.”\n“It is what gave me the original idea,” Raboniel said. “I decided if there\nwas a hybrid between Honor’s Light and Cultivation’s, there must be a\nreason no one had mixed Odium’s Light with either.”\n“Questions are the soul of science,” Navani said, sipping her wine. “But\nassumptions must be proven, Ancient One. From my research I believe\nthese two aren’t opposites, but it isn’t proven to me yet.”\n“And to prove it?”\n“We need an emulsifier,” Navani said. “Something that causes them to\nmix. Unfortunately, I can’t fathom what such an emulsifier would be,\nthough it might be related to sound. I only recently learned that Stormlight\nresponds to tones.”\n“Yes,” Raboniel said, taking a sphere off the desk. “The sounds of\nRoshar.”\n“Can you hear the Light?” Navani asked.\nRaboniel hummed—then thought to nod—her response. She held up a\ndiamond, crystalline and pure, filled with Stormlight from the highstorm the\nday before. “You have to concentrate, and know what you’re seeking, to\nhear it from a sphere. A pure tone, extremely soft.”\nNavani hit the proper tuning fork, letting the tone ring in the room.\nRaboniel nodded. “Yes, that is it. Exactly the same. Only…”\nNavani sat up. “Only?”\n“The sphere’s tone has a rhythm to it,” Raboniel explained, eyes closed\nas she held the sphere. “Each Light has a rhythm. Honor’s is stately.\nCultivation’s is stark and staccato, but builds.”"

Honor’s is stately.\nCultivation’s is stark and staccato, but builds.”\n“And Odium’s?”\n“Chaos,” she said, “but with a certain strange logic to it. The longer you\nlisten, the more sense it makes.”\nNavani sat back, sipping her wine, wishing she had access to Rushu and\nthe other scholars. Raboniel had forbidden her from drawing on their\nexpertise in this matter, giving the problem to Navani alone. Navani, who\nwasn’t a scholar.\nWhat would Jasnah do in this situation? Well, other than find a way to\nkill Raboniel?\nNavani felt the answers were right in front of her. So often, that was the\ncase with science. The ancient humans had fought with stone weapons, but\nthe secrets to metallurgy had been within their grasp.…\n“Does Towerlight have a tone?” Navani asked.\n“Two tones,” Raboniel said, opening her eyes and setting down the\nStormlight sphere. “But they aren’t simply the tones of Cultivation and of\nHonor. They are … different, changed so that they are in harmony with one\nanother.”\n“Curious,” Navani said. “And is there a rhythm to it?”\n“Yes,” Raboniel said. “Both tones adopt it, harmonizing as they play the\nsame rhythm. A symphony combining Honor’s control and Cultivation’s\never-building majesty.”\nTheir Towerlight spheres had all run out by now, and Raboniel had no\nway to restore them, so there was nothing for them to check.\n“Plants grow by Stormlight,” Navani said, “if you beat the proper\nrhythm in their presence.”\n“An old agricultural trick,” Raboniel said. “It works better with\nLifelight, if you can find some.”\n“Why, though?” Navani asked. “Why does Light respond to tones? Why\nis there a rhythm that makes plants grow?” Navani dug in her materials and\nbegan setting up an experiment.\n“I have asked myself this question many times,” Raboniel said. “But it\nseems like asking why gravity pulls. Must we not accept some\nfundamentals of science as baselines? That some things in this world simply\nwork?”\n“No, we don’t have to,” Navani said. “Even gravity has a mechanism\ndriving it. There are proofs to show why the most basic addition problems\nwork. Everything has an explanation.”\n“I have heard,” Raboniel said, “that the Lights respond to sound because\nit is reminiscent of the voice of the Shards commanding them to obey.”\nNavani hit the tuning forks, touched them to their respective gemstones,\nthen put them in place. A thin stream of Stormlight ran from one gemstone,\na thin stream of Voidlight from the other. They met together at the center—\nswirling around an empty gemstone. Neither Light entered it.\n“Voidlight and Stormlight,” Navani said. “The voices of gods.” Or\nperhaps something older than that. The reason the beings called gods spoke\nthe way they did.\nRaboniel came in close, shoulder-to-shoulder with Navani as they\nobserved the streams of Light.\n“You said that Stormlight and Lifelight make a rhythm together when"

They are\nopposites. One orderly, organized. The other…”\nHer words drifted off, and her eyes narrowed.\n“… the other chaotic,” Raboniel whispered, “but with a logic to it. An\nunderstandable logic. Could we perhaps contrast it? Chaos always seems\nmore powerful when displayed against an organized background.…”\nFinally she pursed her lips. “No, I cannot imagine it.”\nNavani tapped the rim of her cup, inspecting the failed experiment.\n“If you could hear the rhythms,” Raboniel said, “you’d understand. But\nthat is beyond humans.”\n“Sing one for me,” Navani said. “Honor’s tone and rhythm.”\nRaboniel complied, singing a pure, vibrant note—the tone of Stormlight,\nthe same as made by the tuning fork. Then she made the tone waver,\nvibrate, pulse in a stately rhythm. Navani hummed along, matching the\ntone, trying to affix it into her mind. Raboniel was obviously\noveremphasizing the rhythm, making it easier for her to recognize.\n“Change now,” Navani said, “to Odium’s rhythm.”\nRaboniel did so, singing a discordant tone with a violent, chaotic rhythm.\nNavani tried to match it with Honor’s tone. She had vocal training, like any\nlighteyed woman of her dahn. However, it hadn’t been an area of express\nstudy for her. Though she tried to hold the tone against Raboniel’s forceful\nrhythm, she quickly lost the note.\nRaboniel cut off, then softly hummed a different rhythm. “That was a\nfine attempt,” Raboniel said. “Better than I’ve heard from other humans, but\nwe must admit you simply aren’t built for this kind of work.”\nNavani took a drink, then swirled the wine in her cup.\n“Why did you want me to sing those rhythms?” Raboniel asked. “What\nwere you hoping to accomplish?”\n“I thought that perhaps if we melded the two songs, we could find the\nproper harmony that would come from a combination of Stormlight and\nVoidlight.”\n“It won’t be that easy,” Raboniel said. “The tones would need to change\nto find a harmony. I’ve tried this many times, Navani, and always failed.\nThe songs of Honor and Odium do not mesh.”\n“Have you tried it with a human before?” Navani asked.\n“Of course not. Humans—as we just proved—can’t hold to a tone or\nrhythm.”\n“We proved nothing,” Navani said. “We had a single failed experiment.”\nShe set her cup on the table, then crossed the room and dug through her\nthings.

But it was rigged to hold a long sequence of\ngemstones.\nNavani ripped off the interior leather of the sheath, then settled at the\ntable and fiddled with the screws and set new gemstones—full of\nStormlight—into it.\n“What is this?” Raboniel said.\n“You can hear the songs and rhythms of Roshar,” Navani said. “Perhaps\nit’s merely because you have better hearing.”\nRaboniel hummed a skeptical rhythm, but Navani continued setting the\ngemstones.\n“We can hear them because we are the children of Roshar,” Raboniel\nsaid. “You are not.”\n“I’ve lived here all my life,” Navani said. “I’m as much a child of this\nplanet as you are.”\n“Your ancestors were from another realm.”\n“I’m not speaking of my ancestors,” Navani said, strapping the sheath on\nso the flats of the gemstones touched her arm. “I’m speaking of myself.”\nShe reset her experiment on the table, sending new lines of Stormlight and\nVoidlight out of gemstones, making them swirl at the center around an\nempty one.\n“Sing Honor’s tone and rhythm again, Ancient One,” Navani asked.\nRaboniel sat back on her stool, but complied. Navani closed her eyes,\ntightening her arm sheath. It had been built as a fabrial, but she wasn’t\ninterested in that function. All she wanted was something that would hold\nlarge gemstones and press them against her skin.\nShe could feel them now, cool but warming to her touch. Infused\ngemstones always had a tempest inside. Was there a sound to them too? A\nvibration …\nCould she hear it in there? The tone, the rhythm? With Raboniel singing,\nshe thought she could. She matched that tone, and felt something on her\narm. The gemstones reacting—or rather the Stormlight inside reacting.\nThere was a beat to it. One that Raboniel’s rhythm only hinted at. Navani\ncould sing the tone and feel the gemstones respond. It was like having a\nstronger singer beside her—she could adapt her voice to match. The\nStormlight itself guided her—providing a control, with a beat and rhythm.\nNavani added that rhythm to her tone, tapping her foot, concentrating.\nShe imagined a phantom song to give it structure.\n“Yes!” Raboniel said, cutting off. “Yes, that’s it!”\n“Odium’s rhythm now,” Navani said to Honor’s tone and beat.\nRaboniel did so, and it struck Navani like a wave, making her tone falter.\nShe almost lost it, but the gemstones were her guide. Navani sang louder,\ntrying to hold that tone.\nIn turn, Raboniel sang more forcefully.\nNo, Navani thought, taking a breath then continuing to sing. No, we can’t\nfight. She took Raboniel’s hand, singing the tone, but softer. Raboniel\nquieted as well. Holding the Fused’s hand, Navani felt as if she were\nreaching for something. Her tone changed slightly.\nRaboniel responded, their two tones moving toward one another, step by\nstep, until …\nHarmony."

Drumbeats. Signals. Together.\nNavani reached over and placed their clasped hands on the empty\ngemstone at the center of the experiment, holding them there as they sang\nfor an extended moment in concert. In tandem, a pure harmony where\nneither took control.\nThe two of them looked at each other, then fell silent. Carefully, they\nremoved their hands to reveal a diamond glowing a vibrant black-blue. An\nimpossible color.\nRaboniel trembled as she picked the gemstone out of its place, then held\nit up, humming a reverential rhythm. “They did not annihilate one another,\nas I assumed. Indeed, as part of me hoped. You were right, Navani.\nRemarkably, I have been proven wrong.” She turned the gemstone in her\nfingers. “I can name this rhythm: the Rhythm of War. Odium and Honor\nmixed together. I had not known it before today, but I recognize its name; I\nknow this as surely as I know my own. Each rhythm carries with it an\nunderstanding of its meaning.”\nThe sphere they had created was different from Szeth’s—blue instead of\nviolet, and lacking the strange distortion. Navani couldn’t be certain, but it\nseemed to her that was what Raboniel had been seeking.\n“Ancient One,” Navani said. “Something confuses me. Why would you\nhave preferred that these two annihilate one another?” Navani had an\ninkling why. But she wanted to see what she could prompt the Fused to\nreveal.\nRaboniel sat for a long time, humming softly to herself as she inspected\nthe gemstone. She seemed fascinated by the motion within, the Stormlight\nand the Voidlight mixed to form something that surged in brilliant raging\nstorms, then fell still—peaceful and quiet—between.\n“Do you know,” the Fused finally asked, “how Honor was killed?”\n“I … am not certain I accept that he was.”\n“Oh, he was. At least the being you call the Almighty—the being who\ncontrolled the Shard of power that was Honor—is dead. Long dead. Do you\nknow how?”\n“No.”\n“Neither do I,” Raboniel said. “But I wonder.”\nNavani sat back in her seat. “Surely, if it is true—and my husband says it\nis, so I accept the possibility—then the mechanisms of the deaths of gods\nare far beyond the understanding of humans and Fused alike.”\n“And did you not tell me earlier that everything has a mechanism? The\ngods give us powers. What are those powers? Gravitation, Division,\nTransformation … the fundamental Surges that govern all things. You said\nthat nothing simply is. I accept that, and your wisdom. But by that same\nlogic, the gods—the Shards—must work not by mystery, but by\nknowledge.”\nShe turned the gemstone in her fingers, then met Navani’s eyes. “Honor\nwas killed using some process we do not yet understand.

The\nFused tucked away the gemstone, and Navani forced herself to focus on this\nmoment. This discovery.\n“I thought for certain it was something about the nature of Odium’s\npower contrasting Honor’s power that led to the destruction,” Raboniel said.\n“I was wrong, and you have proven exceedingly helpful in leading me to\nthis proof. Now, I must abandon this line of reasoning and focus on my\nactual duty—the securing of the tower.”\n“And your promise that you would leave if I helped you find this Light?”\n“I’m sorry,” Raboniel said. “Next time, try not to be so trusting.”\n“In the end,” Navani whispered, “you are his, and I am Honor’s.”\n“Unfortunately,” Raboniel said. “You may remain here and continue\nwhatever other research you wish. You have earned that, and my gratitude.\nIf you would like to seek a simple job in the tower instead, I will arrange it.\nConsider your options, then tell me your wishes.” Raboniel hesitated. “It is\nrare for a Fused to be in the debt of a human.”\nWith that, she left. Navani, in turn, downed the rest of the cup of wine,\nher head abuzz with implications.\nSEVEN AND A HALF YEARS AGO\nVenli ducked out of the way of a patrol of human guards. As she hid in the\ndoorway, she attuned Peace in an attempt to calm her emotions. She’d come\nwith her people to sign the treaty, but that—and the feast to mark the\noccasion—was still hours away. While her people prepared, Venli crept\nthrough forbidden hallways in their palace.\nThe pair of guards, chatting in the Alethi tongue, continued on their\npatrol.

Ulim assured her that her people had built equally\ngrand structures once, and they would again. They would build such\namazing creations, this palace of Kholinar would look like a hut by\ncomparison.\nWould that she could skip this middle part, where she was required to be\nin such danger. Planning with Ulim, that she liked. Being famous for\nrevealing warform, that she loved. This creeping about though … She’d\nexpressly disobeyed human rules, slipping into forbidden sections of the\npalace. If she were caught …\nShe closed her eyes and listened to the Rhythm of Peace. Only a little\nlonger, she thought. Just until Ulim’s companions reach us. Then this will\nall be over.\nHowever, she found herself questioning more now that Ulim had left her\ngemheart. Ulim spoke of a hidden storm and a coming war, with figures of\nlegend returning to fight. That talk spun in her head—and things that\nseemed so rational a day ago now confused her. Was this really the best way\nto convince her people to explore forms of power? Wasn’t she toying with\nwar and destruction? Why was Ulim so eager?\nAs soon as they’d reached the palace, he’d insisted that she help him\ngather a bag of gemstones left by his agent here. More spren, like him,\nready to be delivered to Venli’s scholars. That hadn’t been part of the\noriginal plan. She’d merely wanted to show her people how dangerous the\nhumans were.\nBut what was she to do? She’d started this boulder rolling down the cliff.\nIf she tried to stop it now, she’d be crushed. So she continued doing as he\nsaid. Even if, without him in her gemheart, she felt old and dull. Without\nhim, she couldn’t hear the new rhythms. She craved them. The world made\nmore sense when she listened to those.\n“There you are,” Ulim said, zipping down the hallway. He moved like\nlightning, crawling along the top of the stone—and he could vanish, making\nonly certain people able to see him. “Why are you cringing like a child?\nCome on. We must be moving.”\nShe glanced around the corner. The guards had long since moved on. “I\nshouldn’t have to do this,” Venli hissed at him. “I shouldn’t have to expose\nmyself.”\n“Someone needs to carry the gemstones,” Ulim said. “So unless you\nwant me to find someone else to be the greatest among your people, do\nwhat I say.”\nFine. She crept after him, though she’d lately found Ulim’s tone\nincreasingly annoying. She disliked his crass, dismissive attitude. He’d\nbetter not abandon her again. He had claimed he needed to scout the way,\nbut she was half convinced he wanted her to be discovered.\nHe led her up a stairwell. The Rhythm of Fortune blessed her, and she\nemerged onto the top floor without meeting any humans—though she did\nhave to hide in the stairwell as more guards passed.\n“Why must we come all the way up here!” she hissed after they passed.\n“Couldn’t your friend have brought the gemstones into the basement, where\nall the other listeners are?”"

I’m\ncertain it’s all right. We have a meeting point where she leaves things for\nme. The gemstones will be there.”\nVenli hummed to Betrayal. How could he leave out such an important\ndetail? She was sneaking through the human palace—jeopardizing the\ntreaty—based on flawed information? Before she could demand more\nanswers, however, Ulim turned back into a patch of energy on the floor and\nshot forward.\nShe had no choice but to scramble after him across the hallway, feeling\nterribly exposed. They should have brought Demid. She liked how he\nlistened to what she said, and he always had a ready compliment. He’d\nenjoy sneaking about, and she’d feel braver with him along.\nShe wove through the hallways, certain she’d be discovered at any\nmoment. Yet by some miracle, Ulim got her through to a small room with\nchamber pots scattered across the floor. She pulled out a gemstone and\nnoted a hole in the floor on one side of the room—it looked like they\ndumped waste in here, pouring it into some foul cesspit several stories\nbelow.\nThis was her goal? A privy? She gagged, and was forced to start\nbreathing through her mouth.\n“Here,” Ulim said, crackling on the side of one of the chamber pots.\n“So help me,” Venli said to Skepticism, “if I find human waste inside…”\nShe removed the lid. Fortunately, the interior was clean and empty save\nfor a folded piece of paper.\nUlim pulsed to Exultation. He’d been worried, it seemed. Venli unfolded\nthe paper, and knew the Alethi script well enough to figure out it was a list\nof cleaning instructions.\n“It’s ciphered,” Ulim said. “Do you think we’d be so stupid as to leave\nnotes in the open where anyone could read them? Let me interpret.…”\nHe formed into the shape of a human, standing on a table full of pots.\nShe hated that he took a human form rather than that of a listener. He leaned\nforward, his eyes narrow.\n“Bother,” he said.\n“What?”\n“Let me think, femalen,” he snapped.\n“What does it say?”\n“Axindweth says she’s been discovered,” he said. “She’s a very specific\nand rare kind of specialist—the details need not concern you—but there is\napparently another of her kind in the palace. An agent for someone else.\nThey found her and turned the human king against her. She’s decided to\npull out.”\n“… Pull out?” Venli said. “I don’t understand that phrasing.”\n“She’s leaving! Or left. Perhaps days ago.”\n“Left the palace?”\n“The planet, you idiot.”\nUlim blurred, carapace-like barbs breaking his skin and jabbing out, then"

It seemed to happen to the beat of one of the new rhythms,\nperhaps Fury.\nUlim told her so little. Venli knew there was a way to travel from this\nworld to the place the humans called Damnation. The land of the Voidspren.\nMany thousands of spren waited there to help her people, but they couldn’t\nget free without some Surge or power. Something to … pull them across the\nvoid between worlds.\nSo what did this mean? Had his agent returned to the world Ulim had\ncome from? Or had she gone someplace else? Was she gone for good? How\nwere they going to transfer spren across to this land, to build power for the\nstorm?\nMost importantly, did Venli want that to happen? He’d promised her\nforms of power, but she’d assumed that she’d bring this to the Five after\nfrightening them with how powerful the humans were. Everything was\nmoving so quickly, slipping out of her control. She almost demanded\nanswers, but the way those spikes broke Ulim’s skin—the way he pulsed—\nmade her remain quiet. He was a force of nature come alive. And the\nparticular force he exhibited now was destructive.\nEventually his pulsing subsided. The spikes settled beneath his skin. He\nremained standing on the table, staring at the sheet of paper with the\noffending words.\n“What do we do?” Venli finally asked.\n“I don’t know. There is nothing here for us. I … I have to leave, see if I\ncan find answers elsewhere.”\n“Leave?” Venli said. “What about your promises? What about our\nplans?”\n“We have no plans!” Ulim said, spinning on her. “You said coming here\nwould intimidate your people. Is that happening? Because from what I’ve\nseen, they seem to be enjoying themselves! Planning to feast and laugh,\nmaybe get into storming bed with the humans!”\nVenli attuned Determination, and then it faded to Reconciliation. She had\nto admit it; her people weren’t intimidated, not like she was. Even Eshonai\nhad grown more relaxed—not more worried—as they’d interacted with the\nhumans. These days, Venli’s sister didn’t even wear warform.\nVenli wanted to blame her alone, but the problems with the listeners\nwere far bigger than Eshonai. No one else seemed to see what Venli did.\nThey should have been terrified by all the parshmen—the enslaved singers\n—in the palace. Instead, Venli’s people seemed curious.\nNo one saw the threat Venli did. She didn’t understand, or believe, some\nof the things Ulim said. But in coming here, Venli realized for herself that\nthe humans could not be trusted. If she didn’t do anything, it would be her\npeople—her mother—enslaved to the humans.\nUlim formed into crackling lightning and zipped down the table leg and\nalong the floor. She took a step after him, attuning the Terrors—but he was\ngone, out under the door. By the time she looked into the hall, he’d\nvanished.\nShe closed the door and found herself breathing heavily.

She was alone\nin the enemy’s stronghold, having snuck into forbidden hallways. What\nshould she do? What could she do?\nWait. Ulim would come back.\nHe didn’t though. And each moment she stood there attuned to the\nTerrors was more excruciating than the last. She had to strike out on her\nown. Perhaps she could sneak back the way she’d come? She ripped up the\nnote, then dumped it out the shaft with the waste. She attuned\nDetermination and slipped from the room.\n“You there!”\nShe cringed, attuning Mourning. One hallway. She hadn’t been able to\ncross even one hallway.\nA human soldier in a glistening breastplate marched up, a long, wicked\nweapon in his hand—a spear, but with an axe’s head.\n“Why are you here?” he asked her in the Alethi tongue.\nShe played dumb, speaking in her own language. She pointed toward the\nsteps. Perhaps if he thought she couldn’t speak Alethi, he’d simply let her\ngo?\nInstead he took her roughly by the arm and marched her along the\nhallway. Each time she tried to pull away he yanked harder, leading her\ndown the steps and through this maze of a palace. He eventually deposited\nher in a room where several women were writing with spanreeds—Venli\nstill wished her people knew how to make those. A gruff older soldier with\na proper beard took reports.\n“Found this one on the top floor,” the guard said, pushing Venli into a\nseat. “She was poking around in a suspicious way.”\n“Does she speak Alethi?” asked the man with the beard.\n“No, sir,” the man said. He saluted, then returned to his post.\nVenli sat quietly, trying not to attune rhythms with too much dread.\nSurely this wouldn’t look too bad. She could complain she got lost. And\nwandered up several flights of stairs … And snuck past guards … When\nthey’d been told several times to stay away …\nWhen I find Ulim again, she thought, attuning Betrayal, I will … What?\nWhat could she do to a spren? What was she without him and his promises?\nShe suddenly felt very, very small. She hated that feeling.\n“You look like one of their scholars,” the older man said, his arms\nfolded. “You really can’t speak Alethi? Or were you playing dumb?”\n“I … was playing dumb.” She immediately regretted speaking. Why had\nshe exposed herself?\nThe man grunted. Their version of attuning Amusement, she thought.\n“And what were you doing?”\n“Looking for the privy.”\nDead flat stare. The human version of attuning Skepticism.\n“I found it,” she said to Reconciliation. “Eventually. Room with all the\npots.”\n“I’m going to note this,” he said, nodding to one of the scribes, who\nbegan writing. “Your name?”\n“Venli,” she said.\n“If you were a human, I’d lock you up until someone came for you—or\nI’d give you to someone who could get me answers.

Once the feast happens and the treaty is signed, we’ll see.\nEverything happens without a problem, and you can go in for the after-\nfeast. Something goes wrong … well, then we’ll have another conversation,\nwon’t we?”\nVenli attuned Disappointment, but nothing was going to happen. She’d\nprobably suffer nothing more than a talking-to from her sister. Part of her\nwould rather be locked up.\nShe nodded anyway. In truth, she found the man’s actions surprisingly\nrational. Keeping her close would stop anything she might have planned—\nand if she truly was a lost guest, he wouldn’t be in any real trouble for\nholding her for a few hours.\nShe contemplated insisting she was too important for this. She discarded\nthat idea. Caught so quickly after being abandoned by Ulim … Well, it was\nhard to keep pretending she was strong. The feeling of smallness persisted.\nThe soldier left her to go talk quietly to the women, and Venli made out\nsome of their conversation. He had them report to other guard stations in\nthe palace, informing them he’d picked up a wandering “Parshendi” and\nasking if anyone else had seen individuals entering forbidden or suspicious\nlocations.\nVenli found herself attuning Praise unexpectedly. It was … nice to be\nalone. Lately, Ulim had always been around. She began thinking about how\nshe could clean this up. Go talk to the Five. Maybe—despite how much it\nhurt to admit it—go ask Eshonai for advice.\nUnfortunately, Ulim soon zipped in through the open door as a trail of\nred lightning. She hummed Confusion, then Betrayal, as he moved up her\nchair leg and formed into a person on her armrest.\n“We have a big problem,” Ulim said to her.\nShe hummed a little louder.\n“Oh, get over yourself, girl,” he said. “Listen, there are Heralds in the\npalace tonight.”\n“Heralds?” she whispered. “Here? They’re dead!”\n“Hush!” he said, glancing over his shoulder at the humans. “They’re not\ndead. You have no idea how royally, colossally, incredibly ruined we are. I\nsaw Shalash first and followed her—then ran across not only Kalak, but\nNale. I think he saw me. He shouldn’t have been able to, but—”\nA figure darkened the doorway to the guard post. The bearded soldier\nlooked up. Venli turned slowly, attuning Anxiety. The newcomer was an\nimposing figure with deep brown skin and a pale mark on his cheek, almost\nlike a listener might have as part of their skin pattern. He was in uniform,\nthough it wasn’t of the cut the Alethi wore.\nHe looked at Venli, then pointedly at Ulim—who groaned. Then the man\nfinally looked over at the soldier.\n“Ambassador?” the guardsman asked. “What do you need?”"

He\nstepped forward, placing something on the nearest scribe’s desk. “This is a\nseal of deputation. I have legal jurisdiction in this land, as granted by your\nking. You will authenticate it.”\n“I’m not sure…” the scribe woman said.\n“You will authenticate it,” the man repeated. Perfectly void of emotion\nor rhythm. He made Venli feel cold. Particularly as he turned toward her.\nBehind him, the scribes began scribbling with their spanreeds. The\nnewcomer blocked most of Venli’s view of them.\n“Hello, Ulim,” the man said in a soft, steady voice.\n“Um … hello, Nale,” the spren said. “I … um. I didn’t expect to see you\nhere. Um, today. Anytime, actually … Ever … How is, ah, Shalash?”\n“Small talk is unnecessary, Ulim,” Nale said. “We are not friends. You\npersist only because I cannot destroy spren.” The strange man affixed his\nunblinking gaze on Venli. “Listener. Do you know what this is?”\n“Just another spren,” she said.\n“You are wise,” Nale said. “He is just another spren, isn’t he? How long\nhave you known him?”\nVenli didn’t reply—and she saw Ulim pulse to Satisfaction. He did not\nwant her speaking.\n“Brightlord,” one of the scribes called. “It appears you are correct. You\nmay requisition this prisoner. We were simply going to hold her until—”\n“Thank you,” Nale said, taking his seal from the scribe, then walked out\ninto the hall. “Follow, listener.”\nUlim hopped onto her shoulder and grabbed hold of her hair. “Go\nahead,” he whispered. “But don’t tell him anything. I am in so much\ntrouble.…”\nVenli followed the strange man from the guard room. She’d never seen a\nhuman that shade before, though it wasn’t a true onyx like a listener pattern.\nThis was more the color of a rockbud shell.\n“How many are there?” Nale asked her. “Spren like him? How many\nhave returned?”\n“We—” Ulim began.\n“I would hear the listener,” Nale said.\nShe’d rarely known Ulim to be quiet, and he rarely did as she asked.

Her people needed forms of power.\nAnd to get them, she somehow had to navigate this conversation without\nbeing murdered by this creature.\n“Answer my question,” the Herald said. “How many spren like him are\nthere? How many Voidspren have returned?”\n“I have seen only this one,” Venli said.\n“It is impossible that he has remained on Roshar all these years,” Nale\nsaid. “It has been … a long time, I believe. Generations perhaps, since the\nlast true Desolation?”\nHow could this creature not remember how long it had been since the\nReturns ended? Perhaps he was so far above mortals that he didn’t measure\ntime the same way.\n“I thought it impossible for them to cross the distance between worlds,”\nNale said. “Could it have been … No. Impossible. I’ve been vigilant. I’ve\nbeen careful. You must tell me! How did you accomplish his return?”\nSo cold. A voice with no rhythms, and no human emotions. Yet those\nwords … He was raving.

Though she’d been considering telling\nhim the truth, that instinct retreated before his dead words.\nShe might not trust Ulim completely, but she certainly couldn’t turn to\nthis Herald instead.\n“We didn’t do anything to return them,” she said, taking a gamble based\non what he’d said earlier. “It was what you did.”\n“Impossible,” Nale repeated. “Ishar said only a Connection between the\nworlds could cause a bridge to open. And Taln has not given in. I would\nknow if he had.…”\n“Do not blame us,” Venli said, “for your failure.”\nNale kept his eyes forward. “So, Gavilar’s plan is working. The fool.

Emotionless. “I believe I must offer you a service,\nlistener.

Tonight I found reason to\nhave him killed, but it will take me months of planning to achieve the\nproper legality.\n“Fortunately, I have read your treaty. There is a provision allowing one\nparty to legally break it and attack the other—should they have proof the\nother is conspiring against them. I know for a fact that Gavilar is planning\nto use this very provision to assault your people in the near future. I give\nyou this knowledge, sworn by a Herald of the Almighty. You have proof\nthat he is conspiring against you, and may act.\n“The man who can help you is a slave for sale in the market. The person\nwho owns him is hoping some of the king’s wealthy visitors will want to\npick up new servants before the feast. You have little time remaining. The\nslave you want is the sole Shin man among the crowd. The gemstones your\npeople wear as ornaments will be enough to buy him.”\n“I don’t understand,” Venli said.\nNale looked at Ulim on her shoulder. “This Shin man bears Jezrien’s\nBlade. And he is expertly trained in its employ.” He looked back to Venli. “I\njudge you innocent of any crime, using provision eighty-seven of the Alethi\ncode—pardon of a criminal who has a more vital task to perform for the\ngood of the whole.”\nHe then strode away, leaving them in the hall.\n“That was…” Ulim said. “Wow. He’s far gone. As bad as some of the\nFused. But that was well done, Venli. I’m trying not to sound too surprised.\nI think you may have fooled someone who is basically a god.”\n“It’s an old trick, Ulim,” she said. “Everyone—humans, listeners, and\napparently gods—deep down suspects that every failure is their own. If you\nreflect blame on them, most people will assume they are responsible.”\n“Maybe I gave up on you too easily,” he said. “Old Jezrien’s Blade is\nhere, is it? Curious…”\n“What does that mean?”\n“Let’s say,” Ulim told her, “your people were to start a war with the\nhumans. Would that lead your people to the desperation we want? Would\nthey take the forms we offer?”\n“Attack the humans?” Venli said to Confusion. They stood alone in the\nhallway, but she still hushed her voice. “Why would we do what that Herald\nsaid? We’re not here to start a war, Ulim. I merely want to get my people\nready to face one, should the humans try to destroy us!”\nUlim crackled with lightning, then moved up her arm, toward her\ngemheart. She hesitated to let him in. He worked in strange ways, not\naccording to the rules. He could move in and out of her without a highstorm\nto facilitate the transformation.\nHe began to vibrate energy through her.

You feel wrong, Shallan. Mmm. You must listen. I did use the\ncube. I have a copy of the key to your trunk. Wit helped me.”\n“It’s no matter,” Shallan said. “Done. Over. Don’t care. Let’s move on\nand—”\nPattern took her hands, kneeling beside her. His pattern, once so alien to\nher eyes, was now familiar. She felt as if by staring at its shifting lines, she\ncould see secrets about how the world worked. Maybe even about how she\nworked.\n“Please,” Pattern said. “Let me tell you. We don’t have to talk about your\npast; I was wrong to try to force you. Yes, I did take the cube. To talk to"

He has a cube like it too, Shallan! He told me.\n“I was so worried about you. I didn’t know what to do. So I went to him,\nand he said we could talk with the cube, if I was worried. Mmm … About\nwhat was happening with you. He said I was very funny! But when I talked\nto him last, he warned me. He’s been spied on by the Ghostbloods. The\nthings I told him, another heard. That was how Mraize knew things.”\n“You talked to Wit,” Shallan whispered. “And a spy overheard? That …\nThat means…”\n“None of your friends are traitors,” Pattern said. “Except me! Only a\nlittle though! I am sorry.”\nNo spy. And Pattern …\nWas this another lie? Was she getting so wrapped up in them that she\ncouldn’t see what was true? She gripped his too-long hands. She wanted so\nbadly to trust again.\nYour trust kills, Shallan, the dark part of her thought. The part she named\nFormless. Except it wasn’t formless. She knew exactly what it was.\nFor now, she retreated—and released Veil and Radiant. Veil immediately\ntook control and gasped, putting her hand to her head. “Storms,” she\nwhispered. “That was a … strange experience.”\n“I have made things worse,” Pattern said. “I am very foolish.”\n“You tried to help,” Veil said. “But you should have come to me. I’m\nVeil, by the way. I could have helped you.”\nPattern hummed softly. Veil got the sense that he didn’t trust her\ncompletely. Well, she wasn’t certain she trusted her own mind completely,\nso there was that.\n“There’s a lot to think about in what you said,” Veil said. “For now,\nplease don’t keep anything more from us. All right?”\nPattern’s pattern slowed, then quickened, and he nodded.\n“Great.” Veil took a deep breath. Well, that was over.\nWho killed Ialai? Shallan whispered from inside.\nVeil hesitated.\nPerhaps Pattern was the one who moved the cube all those times,\nShallan said. And he’s the reason Mraize knew about the seed we planted\nabout the corrupted spren. But someone killed Ialai. Who was it?\nStorms. There was more to this mess. A lot more. Veil, however, needed\ntime to digest it. So for now, she put all of that aside and picked up the\ncommunication cube. She repeated the incantation. “Deliver to me Mraize,\ncube, and transfer my voice to him.”\nIt took longer this time than others; she didn’t know what the difference\nwas. She sat there some ten minutes before Mraize finally spoke.\n“I trust you have only good news to report, little knife,” his voice said.\n“It’s bad news—but you’re getting it anyway,” she said. “This is Veil,\nwith Pattern here. We’ve eliminated the final human in Lasting Integrity\nfrom consideration. Either Restares has learned to disguise himself beyond"

Either Restares has learned to disguise himself beyond\nmy ability to spot him, or he’s not here.”\n“How certain are you of this?” Mraize said, calm. She’d never seen him\nget upset at bad news.\n“Depends,” she said. “Like I said, he could have disguised himself. Or\nmaybe your intel is wrong.”\n“It’s possible,” Mraize admitted. “Communication between realms is\ndifficult, and information travels slowly. Have you asked if any humans left\nthe fortress recently?”\n“They claim the last human who left was five months ago,” she said.\n“But that was Azure, not Restares. I know her. I’ve described our quarry to\nseveral honorspren, but they say the description is too vague, and that many\nhumans look alike to them. I’m inclined to think they’re telling the truth.\nThey completely neglected to mention that Sixteen—the person I’ve spent\nthe last few days planning to intercept—was Shin.”\n“Troubling,” Mraize said.\n“You’ve been vague in your answers to me,” Veil said. “Let me ask\nclearly. Could Restares have become a Lightweaver? Cryptics have\ndifferent requirements for bonding than most Radiants.”\n“I highly doubt Restares would have joined any Radiant order,” Mraize\nsaid. “It’s not in his nature. I suppose, however, that we can’t discount the\npossibility. There are variations on Lightweaving in the cosmere that do not\nrequire a spren—plus the Honorblades exist and are poorly tracked these\ndays, even by our agents.”\n“I thought they were all in Shinovar, except the one Moash wields.”\n“They were.” Mraize said it simply, directly, with an implication: She\nwasn’t getting any more information on that topic. Not unless she finished\nthis mission, whereupon he had promised to answer all her questions.\n“You should equip yourself with Stormlight,” Mraize suggested. “If you\nhave not found Restares, there is a chance he knows you are there—and that\ncould be dangerous. He is not the type to fight unless cornered, but once\npushed, there are few beings as dangerous on this planet.”\n“Great, wonderful,” Veil said. “Nice to know I have to start sleeping with\none eye open. You could have warned me.”\n“Considering your paranoia, would you have done anything differently?”\nMraize sounded amused.\n“You’re probably right about the Stormlight,” Veil said. “The honorspren\ndo have a store of it; they let us use it to heal Adolin. Makes me wonder\nwhere they obtained all the perfect gemstones to hold it for so long.”\n“They’ve had millennia to gather them, little knife,” Mraize said. “And\nthey love gemstones, perhaps for the same reason we admire swords.\nDuring the days of the Radiants, some even believed the stories of the Stone\nof Ten Dawns, and spent lifetimes hunting it. How will you obtain\nStormlight from these honorspren?”\n“I’ll begin working on a plan,” she said.\n“Excellent. And how is your … stability, little knife?”"

And how is your … stability, little knife?”\nShe thought about Shallan taking control, locking Veil and Radiant away\nsomehow. “Could be better,” she admitted.\n“Answers will help free you,” Mraize said. “Once you’ve earned them.”\n“Perhaps,” Veil said. “Or perhaps you’ll be surprised at what I already\nknow.” The trouble wasn’t getting answers. It was finding the presence of\nmind to accept them.\nNow, was there a way she could confirm what Pattern had said? About\nWit, and the Ghostbloods spying on him? She toyed with the idea, but\ndecided not to say anything. She didn’t want to tell Mraize too much.\nHer musings were interrupted by the sound of people shouting. That was\nuncommon here in honorspren territory.\n“I need to go,” she told Mraize. “Something’s happening.”\n* * *\nThe honorspren had a multitude of reasons for delaying Adolin’s trial. Their\nfirst and most obvious excuse was the need to wait for the “High Judge,” a\nspren who was out on patrol. Adolin had spent weeks assuming this was the\nStormfather, because of things they’d said. Yet when he’d mentioned that\nthe other day, the honorspren had laughed.\nSo now he had no idea who or what the High Judge was, and their\nanswers to him were strange. The High Judge was some kind of spren, that\nseemed clear. But not an honorspren. The judge was of a variety that was\nvery rare.\nIn any case, waiting for the High Judge to return gave the honorspren\ntime to prepare documentation, notes, and testimonies. Had that all been\nready, though, they wouldn’t have allowed the trial to proceed yet. Because\nAdolin, they explained, was an idiot.\nWell, they didn’t say it in so many words. Still, he couldn’t help but\nsuspect that was how they felt. He was woefully ignorant of what they\nconsidered proper trial procedure. Thus he found himself in today’s\nmeeting. Every two days he had an appointment for instruction. The\nhonorspren were quite clear: His offer, worded as it had been, let them\ncondemn him as a traitor and murderer. Though that hadn’t completely been\nhis intent, this trial would let them pin the sins of the ancient Radiants on\nhim. Before they did so, they wanted him to understand proper trial\nprocedure. What strange beings.\nHe stepped softly through the library, a long flat building on the northern\nplane of Lasting Integrity. Honorspren liked their books, judging by the\nextensive collection—but he rarely saw them in here. They seemed to enjoy\nowning the books, treating them like relics to be hoarded.\nHis tutor, on the other hand, was a different story. She stood on a step\nstool, counting through books on an upper shelf. Her clothing, made of her\nsubstance, was reminiscent of a Thaylen tradeswoman’s attire: a knee-\nlength skirt with blouse and shawl. Unlike an honorspren, her coloring was\nan ebony black, with a certain sheen in the right light. Like the variegated\ncolors oil made on a sword blade."

Like the variegated\ncolors oil made on a sword blade.\nShe was an inkspren; Jasnah had bonded one, though Adolin had never\nseen him. This one called herself Blended—a name that felt peculiar to him.\n“Ah, Highprince,” she said, noting him. “You are.”\n“I am,” he said. During their weeks talking together, he’d grown mostly\naccustomed to her distinctive style of speaking.\n“Good, good,” she said, climbing down the steps. “Our time nearly is\nnot. Come, we must talk.”\n“Our time nearly is not?” Adolin said, hurrying alongside her. She was\nshorter than most honorspren, and wore her hair—pure black like the rest of\nher—pinned up in something that wasn’t quite a braid. Though her skin was\nmostly monochrome black, faint variations outlined her features, making\nher round face and small nose more visible.\n“Yes,” she said. “The honorspren have set the date for your trial. It is.”\n“When?”\n“Three days.”\n“The High Judge is here, then?” Adolin asked as they reached their study\ntable.\n“He must be returning soon,” she said. “Perhaps he already is in this\nplace. So, we must make decisions.” She sat without ceasing her torrent of\nwords. “You are not ready. Your progress is not, Highprince Adolin. I do not\nsay this to be insulting. It simply is.”\n“I know,” he said, sitting down. “Honorspren law is … complex. I wish\nyou could speak for me.”\n“It is not their way.”\n“It seems designed to be frustrating.”\n“Yes,” she agreed. “This is unsurprising, as it was devised by a stuck-up\nbunch of prim, overly polished buttons.”\nThere was no love lost between inkspren and honorspren. And Blended\nwas supposedly among the more diplomatic of her type—she was the\nofficial inkspren emissary to Lasting Integrity.\n“I know an honorspren in my realm,” Adolin said. “She can be …\ninteresting at times, but I wouldn’t call her prim.”\n“The Ancient Daughter?” Blended asked. “She’s not the only one whose\npersonality is as you speak. Many honorspren used to be like that. Others\nstill are. But Lasting Integrity, and those who here are, have had a strong\neffect on many honorspren. They preach isolation. Others listen.”\n“It’s so extreme,” Adolin said. “They must see there is a better way of\ndealing with their anger at humans.”\n“Agreed. A better solution is. I would simply kill you.”\nAdolin started. “… Excuse me?”\n“If a human tries to bond me,” Blended said, flipping through the books\nin her stack, “I will attack him and kill him. This better solution is.”\n“I don’t think Radiants force bonds,” Adolin said.\n“They would coerce. I would strike first. Your kind are not trustworthy.”\nShe set aside one of her books, shaking her head. “Regardless, I am worried\nabout your training. It is weak, through no fault of yours. The honorspren"

The honorspren\nwill use the intricacies of their laws against you, to your detriment. You will\nbe as a child trying to fight a duel. I believe trials among your kind are more\ndirect?”\n“Basically, you go before the lighteyes in charge and plead your case,”\nAdolin said. “He listens, maybe confers with witnesses or experts, then\nrenders judgment.”\n“Brief, simple,” she said. “Very flawed, but simple. The honorspren of\nthis region like their rules. But perhaps a better solution is.” She held up\none of the books she’d been looking through when he arrived. “We can\nmotion for a trial by witness. A variety more akin to what you know\nalready.”\n“That sounds great,” Adolin said, relaxing. If he had to listen to one\nmore lecture including terms like “exculpatory evidence” and\n“compensatory restitution,” he would ask them to execute him and be done\nwith it.\nBlended took notes as she spoke. “It is well I spent these weeks training\nyou in basics. This will prepare you for your best hope of victory, which is\nthis format. Therefore, before I explain, recite to me your general trial\nstrategy.”\nThey’d gone over this dozens of times, to the point that Adolin could\nhave said it backward. He didn’t mind; you drilled your soldiers in battle\nformations until they could do maneuvers in their sleep. And this trial\nwould be like a battle; Blended had repeatedly warned him to be wary of\nverbal ambushes.\n“I need to persuade them that I cannot be held accountable for the\nactions of the ancient Radiants,” Adolin said. “That they cannot shun me or\nmy father because of things done by ancient humans. In order to accomplish\nthis, I will prove my character, I will prove that the modern Radiants are\nunconnected to the old orders, and I will prove that our actions in the face\nof the current crisis are proof of the honor men display.”\nBlended nodded. “We will choose a trial by witness. Assuming your\nmotion is accepted, the trial will happen in three phases over three days.\nThe first day, the High Judge is presented with three testimonies against\nyour cause. The next day, you give your testimony. The final day, accusers\nare allowed one rebuttal, then judgment is requested. This format is not\noften chosen, because it allows so much weight of testimony against you.\nHowever, factoring in how weak your grasp of legal systems is, well … this\nchoice is best.”\nAdolin felt a tremble deep inside. He wished for a fight he could face\nwith sword in hand—but that was the trouble. Any given Radiant could do\nbetter than he at such a fight, so his expertise with the sword was effectively\nobsolete. He could not train himself to the level of a Radiant; they could\nheal from wounds and strike with supernatural grace and strength. The\nworld had entered an era where simply being good at swordplay was not\nenough.\nThat left him to find a new place. Father always complained about being\nunsuited for diplomacy; Adolin was determined not to make the same\ncomplaint. “If I may plead my case on the second day,” he said, “then I’m"

The other methods you suggested would require me to understand too\nmuch of their law.”\n“Yes,” Blended said. “Though I worry that in giving testimony, you will\nincriminate yourself. Worse, you risk asking questions of the audience,\npresenting an opening for their condemnations. You could end up one man\nfacing a crowd of experts in the law and rhetoric.”\n“I have to speak for myself though,” Adolin said. “I fail to see how I can\nachieve what I want without talking to them. I need to prove myself and\nappeal to their honor.”\nBlended flipped through pages of notes. He’d noticed that when she\nwouldn’t look at him, it meant she had something difficult to say.\n“What?” Adolin asked her.\n“You believe much in their honor, Prince Adolin. Your sense of\njustice … is.”\n“They are honorspren,” he said. “Don’t they basically have to be\nhonorable?”\n“A conundrum is in this thing,” Blended said. “Yes, they are honorspren.\nBut honor … isn’t something that … that is.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Men define honor,” Blended said. “And no god can enforce it, no\nlonger. Beyond that, spren like us are not mindless things. Our will is\nstrong. Our perceptions mold our definitions of concepts such as honor and\nright and wrong. Just as with humans.”\n“You’re saying that what they perceive as honorable might not be what I\nperceive as honorable. Syl warned me as much.”\n“Yes,” she said. “What they are defines honor to them. Whatever they\nare.”\n“That’s … frightening,” Adolin admitted. “But there is goodness to\nthem. They care for the deadeyes, even Maya, with great concern and\nattention.”\n“Hmmm, yes,” Blended said. “That one. Did another spren tell you her\nname?”\n“No, she told me herself.”\n“Deadeyes don’t speak. This is.”\n“You all keep saying that, but you’re wrong,” Adolin said. “I heard her\nin my mind. Only once, true, but she said her name. Mayalaran. She’s my\nfriend.”\nBlended cocked her head. “Curious. Very curious…”\n“Deep down, the honorspren must want to help. Surely they’ll listen to\nme. Surely I can make them see.”\n“I will give you the best chance I can,” she said. “But please understand.\nSpren—all spren—fear you with good reason. In order to prove you wrong,\nthey need only prove that bonding men is a risk. That past failings of men\njustify wariness.”\n“Everything is a risk,” Adolin said.\n“Yes. Which is why this trial … is not strong for you. This truth is,\nPrince Adolin.”\n“To hear you say it like that,” he said, trying to laugh about it, “it sounds\nlike I have no chance!”\nShe closed her book. And did not respond.\nHe took a deep breath. “All right. How do we proceed?” he asked.\n“I suspect the best thing is to discover if the High Judge’s return is.”"

How do we proceed?” he asked.\n“I suspect the best thing is to discover if the High Judge’s return is.”\nBlended stood up, leaving the books on the table as she strode toward the\ndoors. Adolin was expected to keep up. She claimed to hate the honorspren\nbecause of an ancient rivalry, but she sure did act like them. Neither gave\nmuch deference to human titles, for example. Adolin didn’t consider\nhimself stuck-up, but couldn’t they treat him with a little more respect?\nOutside, as always, he had that moment of jarring disconnect—his brain\ntrying to reconcile that down wasn’t down and up wasn’t up. That people\nwalked along all four faces inside the rectangular tower.\nHe doubted he could ever feel at ease in this place. The spren claimed it\nwas not Surgebinding that let them walk on the walls here; the long-\nstanding presence of the honorspren instead allowed the tower to choose a\ndifferent type of natural law. Perhaps that sort of talk made sense to Shallan.\nWhere was she anyway? She was often late to these tutoring meetings, but\nshe usually showed up.\nBlended led him across to the corner where the northern plane met the\nwestern plane; most of the official buildings were on the western one.\nAdolin always found this part curious; he had to step out and put one leg on\nthe wall. He followed that by leaning back as he lifted his other leg, feeling\nlike he was about to fall. Instead everything seemed to rotate, and he found\nhimself standing on another plane.\n“You do that better than most humans,” Blended noted. “They often\nseem nauseated by the process.”\nHe shrugged, then followed as she walked him toward a row of short\nbuildings clustered near the base of the tower. Most buildings in Lasting\nIntegrity were only one story. He wasn’t certain what happened if they got\ntoo tall; were you in danger of falling off?\nThey passed groups of honorspren, and he thought about what Blended\nhad said regarding their natures. Not simply of honor—of honor as defined\nby the spren themselves. Well, maybe they weren’t all as stuffy as they\nseemed. He’d catch laughter or a hint of a mischievous grin. Then an older\nuniformed honorspren would walk past—and everyone would grow solemn\nagain. These creatures seemed trapped between an instinct for playfulness\nand their natures as the spren of oaths.\nHe anticipated another tedious discussion with the honorspren who\nmanaged his case—but before Adolin and Blended entered the building of\njustice, she stopped and cocked her head. She waved for him to follow in\nanother direction, and he soon saw why. A disturbance was occurring on the\nground plane, near the gates into the city. A moment of panic made him\nwonder if his friends had decided to rescue him against his wishes—\nfollowed by a deeper worry that all those deadeyes outside had snapped and\ndecided to rush the fortress.\nIt was neither. A group of spren crowded around a newly arrived figure.\n“The High Judge?” Adolin guessed.\n“Yes,” Blended said. “Excellent. You can make your petition to him.”\nShe walked that direction, down along the face of the western plane."

A short Alethi man with thinning hair. That\nwas him, the one she’d been hunting. The High Judge was Restares.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “They did say the High Judge was a spren.\nPerhaps the honorspren lied? Mmm…”\nVeil stepped up to a small crowd of honorspren who had gathered on the\nsouthern plane to gawk at the newcomer. One was Lusintia, the honorspren\nassigned to show Veil around on her first day in the fortress. She was a\nshorter spren, with hair kept about level with the point of her chin. She\ndidn’t wear a uniform, but the stiff jacket and trousers she preferred might\nas well have been one.\nVeil elbowed her way over to Lusintia, earning shocked glances from the\nhonorspren, who generally didn’t crowd in such a way. Pattern followed in\nher wake.\n“That can’t be the High Judge,” Veil said, pointing. “I specifically asked\nif the High Judge was human.”\n“He’s not,” Lusintia said.\n“But—”\n“He might have the form of a man,” Lusintia said. “But he is an eternal\nand immortal spren who blesses us with his presence. That is Kalak, called\nKelek’Elin among your people. Herald of the Almighty. He commanded us\nnot to tell people he was here—and ordered us specifically to not speak of\nhim to humans, so we were not allowed to answer your questions until you\nsaw him for yourself.”\nOne of the Heralds. Damnation.\nThe man Mraize had sent her to find—and, she suspected, the man he\nwanted her to kill—was one of the Heralds.\nJezrien is gone.

Somehow, with\nthe singers invading Urithiru, he’d become more of an outsider.\nHe strode past the vats and tubs to the drying station. Some of the\ntower’s original fabrials—the lifts, the main wells, the air vents—had been\naltered to work with Voidlight. That meant the workers here could set out\nlarge racks for drying in this room where the vents blew a little stronger.\nThere was talk that the Fused would get other fabrials in the tower working\nsoon, but Rlain wasn’t privy to their timelines.\nNear the drying racks he found a small cart waiting for him, filled with\nclean bedding. He counted the sheets as the foreman—a lighteyed human\nwho always seemed to be standing around when Rlain visited—leaned\nagainst the wall nearby, folding his arms.\n“So,” he said to Rlain, “what’s it like? Roaming the tower. Ruling the\nplace. Pretty good, eh?”\n“I don’t rule anything,” Rlain said.\n“Sure, sure. Must feel good though, being in charge of all those people\nwho used to own you.”\n“I’m a listener,” Rlain said to Irritation. “I was never an Alethi slave, just\na spy pretending to be one.” Well, except for Bridge Four. That had felt like\ntrue slavery.\n“But your people are in charge now,” the man prodded, completely\nunable to take a hint.\n“They aren’t my people,” Rlain said. “I’m a listener—I come from an\nentirely different country. I’m as much one of them as you are an Iriali.”\nThe man scratched his head at that. Rlain sighed and wheeled the cart\nover to pick up some pillows. The women there didn’t usually talk to him,\nso he was able to pile up the pillows without getting more than a few\nscowls.\nHe could hear their whispers, unfortunately. Better than they probably\nthought he could.\n“… Don’t speak too loudly,” one was saying. “He’ll report you to them.”\n“He was here all along,” another hissed. “Watching the Windrunners,\nplanning when best to strike. He’s the one who poisoned them.”\n“Hovers over them like a vengeful spren,” a third said. “Watching to kill\nany who wake up. Any who—”\nShe squealed as Rlain spun toward the three women. Their eyes opened\nwide and they drew back. Rlain could feel their tension as he walked up to\nthem.\n“I like cards,” he said.\nThe three stared at him in horror.\n“Cards,” Rlain said to Longing. “I’m best at towers, but I like runaround\ntoo. I’m pretty good, you know. Bisig says it’s because I’m good at bluffing.\nI find it fun. I like it.”\nThe three women exchanged looks, obviously confused.\n“I thought you should know something about me,” Rlain said. “I figured\nmaybe if you did, you would stop making things up.” He nodded to them,"

As he began wheeling it away, the whispers started again.\n“You heard him,” the first woman hissed. “He’s a gambler! Of course.\nThose kind can see the future, you know. Foul powers of the Void. He likes\nto take advantage of those unwise enough to bet against him.…”\nRlain sighed, but kept going. At the door, he knew to step to the side as\none of the singer guards tried to trip him. They hadn’t tired of that same old\nterrible trick—no matter how many times he visited. He shoved his way out\nthe door quickly, but not before one of them called, “See you tomorrow,\ntraitor!” to the Rhythm of Reprimand.\nRlain pushed the cart through the halls of Urithiru. There were a lot of\npeople out, both human and singer. Bringing water from the wells was a\nfull-time duty for many hundreds of workers. A lot of the population had\nmoved away from the perimeter, which was growing too cold. Instead they\ncrowded together into these interior rooms.\nHumans gave way for him. Most of the singers didn’t glance at him, but\nthose who did usually noticed his tattoo. Their rhythms changed, and their\neyes followed him. Some hated him for the treason of his ancestors. Others\nhad been told the listeners were a brave frontrunner group who had\nprepared for Odium’s return. These treated Rlain with reverence.\nIn the face of it all—the frightened humans, the mistrusting Regals, the\noccasionally awed ordinary singers—he wished he could simply be Rlain.\nHe hated that to every one of them, he was some kind of representation of\nan entire people. He wanted to be seen as a person, not a symbol.\nThe closest he’d come had been among the men of Bridge Four. Even\nthough they’d named him “Shen,” of all things. That was like naming one\nof their children “Human.” But for all their faults, they had succeeded in\ngiving him a home. Because they’d been willing to try to see him for\nhimself.\nAs he pushed his cart, he caught sight of that cremling again. The\nnondescript brown one that would scuttle along walls near the ceiling,\nblending in with the stonework. They were still watching him.\nVenli had warned him about this. Voidspren invisibility didn’t work\nproperly in the tower. So it appeared that, to keep an eye on someone here,\nthey’d begun entering an animal’s gemheart. He tried to pretend he hadn’t\nseen it. Eventually, it turned and scuttled down a different hallway.\nVoidspren weren’t fully able to control the animals they bonded; though\napparently the dumber the animal, the easier they were to influence. So\nthere was no way of telling if the Voidspren had decided it had seen enough\nfor the day, or if its host was merely distracted.\nRlain eventually reached the atrium, and like many people, he briefly\nbasked in the light coming through the large eastern window.

There was\nalways a lot of traffic in here these days. Though only the privileged among\nthe singers were allowed to use the lifts, people of both species came here\nfor light.\nHe crossed the atrium with his cart, then pushed it through into the\nRadiant infirmary. He still couldn’t relax—as a surprising number of\nhumans moved through the room among the unconscious Radiants.\nOstensibly they all had a reason to be there. Water carriers, people to\nchange the bedpans, others recruited to help feed broth to the Radiants.\nThere were always new volunteers—the men and women of the tower were\nturning coming here into some kind of pilgrimage. Look in on the Radiants.\nCare for them. Then go burn prayers for them to recover. None of the\npeople working in here seemed bothered by the fact that—not two years\nago—they would have cursed by the Lost Radiants.\nEyes chased Rlain as he—forcing himself to walk to the beat of the\nRhythm of Peace—delivered the cart of freshly laundered sheets and\npillows to those changing them. A man with one arm and haunted eyes was\noverseeing this work today. Like most of the others in the room, he’d\npainted his forehead with the shash glyph. That baffled Rlain.\nA few days ago, Lezian the Pursuer had ordered his men to beat those\nwho wore the forehead mark—though only a day later, that order had been\nreversed by Raboniel. Still seemed strange that so many humans would\nwear the thing. They had to realize they were singling themselves out.\nThough he’d been forced to rein in his men, and there had been fewer\nincidents recently, the Pursuer continued to push for more brutality in the\ntower. Unnervingly, he’d placed a few guards here in the infirmary: two\nstormform Regals currently, on rotation with several other Regals, who\nstood watch at all hours.\nRlain felt their stares on him as he walked to the back of the room where\nLirin and Hesina had used hanging sheets to section off a part as a kind of\noffice and living quarters for themselves. Rlain forced himself to attune\nConfidence until he could step between the sheets.\nInside he found Lirin peeking out at the stormforms. A small surgery\nstation was set up behind him, where Lirin could see patients—because of\ncourse he needed to do that. Kaladin had spoken of his father, and Rlain felt\nhe knew Lirin and Hesina, though he’d interacted with them in person for\nonly a few weeks.\n“Well?” Rlain asked.\n“The stormforms have seen me and Hesina,” Lirin whispered. “We\ncouldn’t stay hidden all the time. But I don’t think it matters. By this point,\nsomeone must have recognized us. I wouldn’t be surprised if those Regals\nwere sent here in the first place because this ‘Pursuer’ discovered we were\nhere.”\n“Maybe you should remain quiet,” Rlain said, searching the ceiling for\ncremlings. “Or maybe we should get you out.”"

As for the Pursuer, Venli says that we should be safe from\nhim, so long as that Heavenly One, Leshwi, protects us.”\n“I don’t know how much I trust any of them, Lirin,” Rlain said.\n“Particularly Fused.”\n“Agreed,” Lirin said. “What games are they playing? Leshwi didn’t even\nask after my son. Do you have any idea why they are acting this way?”\n“Sorry,” Rlain said. “I’m baffled. Our songs barely mention the Fused\nexcept to say to avoid them.”\nLirin grunted. Like the others, he seemed to expect Rlain to understand\nthe Fused and Regals more than he did—but to the surgeon’s credit, he and\nHesina had accepted Rlain without suspicion, despite his race. For all that\nLirin complained about Kaladin, it seemed he considered someone his son\ncalled a friend to be worthy of trust.\n“And Venli?” Lirin asked. “She wears a Regal form. Can we trust her?”\n“Venli could have left me in prison,” Rlain said. “I think she’s proven\nherself.”\n“Unless it’s a long con of some sort,” Lirin said, his eyes narrowing.\nRlain hummed to Reconciliation. “I’m surprised to hear of your\nsuspicion. Kaladin said you always saw the best in people.”\n“My son doesn’t know me nearly as well as he presumes,” Lirin said. He\ncontinued standing by the drapes.\nRlain made his way past the surgery table to where Hesina had set out\none of his stolen maps on the floor. There, he hummed to Anxiety. “Maybe\nwe shouldn’t have these out,” he whispered. “With those Regals around.”\n“We can’t live our lives terrified of enemies at every corner, Rlain,”\nHesina said. “If they wanted to take us, they’d have done it already. We\nhave to assume we’re safe, for now.”\nRlain hummed to Anxiety. But … there was wisdom in her words. He\nforced himself to calm. He had seen that cremling, yes, but didn’t know it\nhad a Voidspren. Perhaps he was jumping at shadows. Likely, he was just\non edge because of the way everyone treated him during his trips through\nthe tower.\n“I keep thinking,” Hesina said, looking over the map, “that if we could\nget this to Kal, it might help.”\nRlain glanced at Lirin, humming to Curiosity. Hesina wouldn’t catch the\nrhythm, but she clearly understood his body language.\n“Lirin’s dispute is not mine,” Hesina said. “He can play the stoic pacifist\nall he wants—and I’ll love him for it. But I’m not going to leave Kal out\nthere alone with no help. You think if he had exact maps of the tower, he\nmight have a better chance?”\n“Couldn’t hurt,” Rlain said, kneeling beside her.

They’d all heard about\nwhat Kaladin had done the other day—appearing spectacularly in the\nBreakaway market, engaging the Fused, fighting in the air.\nThe Fused were obviously frightened. They had immediately started\npublicizing that they’d killed him. Too quickly, and too forcefully, without a\nbody to show. The people of the tower weren’t buying it, and neither was\nRlain. He’d joined Bridge Four later than most, but he’d been there for\nKaladin’s most dramatic transformations. Stormblessed was alive in the\ntower somewhere, planning his next move.\nHesina continued to pore over the map of the tower’s sixth floor—but\nRlain noticed something else. Hesina had set another map aside, one of the\nShattered Plains. Rlain unrolled it fully and found himself attuning the\nRhythm of the Lost. He’d never seen a full map, this detailed, of the entire\nPlains.\nThe immensity didn’t surprise him. He’d been out there as both listener\nand bridgeman. He’d flown with the Windrunners. He understood the scope\nof the Shattered Plains, and was prepared for Narak to seem diminutive\nwhen compared to the expanse of plateaus stretching in all directions. But\nhe wasn’t prepared for how symmetrical it all was, now that he could see it\nall at once.\nYes, the Plains had most definitely been broken in a pattern. He hummed\nto Curiosity as he peered closer, and he picked out some cramped writing\non the far eastern side of the Plains—where the plateaus were worn smaller\nby the winds. That was the direction the chasmfiends migrated after\nbreeding or pupating. A dangerous area full of greatshells, herd animals,\nand predators as large as buildings.\n“Hesina?” Rlain said, turning the map in her direction. “Can you read\nthis part to me?”\nShe leaned over. “Scout report,” she said. “They found a camp out there,\nit seems. Some kind of large caravan or nomadic group. Maybe they’re\nNatans? A lot of this area is unexplored, Rlain.”\nHe hummed to himself, wondering if he should learn to read. Sigzil was\nalways talking about how useful it was, though Rlain didn’t like the idea of\nrelying on written words that had no life, instead of on songs. A piece of\npaper could be burned, lost, destroyed in a storm—but an entire people and\ntheir songs could not be so easily …\nHe trailed off. An entire people. It struck him anew that he was alone.\nNo, Venli is here, he thought. There were two of them. He’d never\nparticularly liked Venli, but at least he wasn’t the sole listener. It made him\nwonder. Should they … try to rebuild? The idea nauseated him for multiple\nreasons. For one, the times he’d tried mateform himself, things hadn’t gone\nthe way he—or anyone really—had expected.\nLirin abruptly pulled back from the curtains.

His motion was so sudden\nthat Hesina took it as a warning and immediately grabbed a sheet and pulled\nit over the maps. Then she laid out some bandages—to appear as if she’d\nspread the sheet onto the floor to keep the bandages clean as she rolled\nthem. It was an excellent cover-up—one Rlain ruined by belatedly moving\nto tuck away his map of the Shattered Plains.\n“It’s not that,” Lirin said, grabbing Rlain by the shoulder. “Come look. I\nthink I recognize one of the workers.”\nLirin pointed out through the drapes, directing Rlain toward a short man.\nHe had a mark on his forehead, but it wasn’t an inked shash glyph. It was a\nBridge Four tattoo like Rlain’s own. Dabbid kept his eyes down, walking\nwith his characteristic sense of mute subservience.\n“I think that man was one of Kaladin’s friends,” Lirin said. “Am I\nright?”\nRlain nodded, then hummed softly to Anxiety and stepped out into the\nmain room. He and Dabbid had often been set to work together as the only\ntwo members of Bridge Four who hadn’t gained Windrunner abilities.\nSeeing him opened that wound again for Rlain, and he hummed forcibly to\nPeace.\nIt wasn’t his fault that spren were as racist as humans. Or as singers. As\npeople.\nHe quietly took Dabbid by the arm, steering him away from the Regals.\n“Storms, I’m glad to see you,” Rlain whispered. “I was worried about you,\nDabbid. Where have you been? Were you frightened? Here, come help me\nbring some water to the others. Like the work we used to do, remember?”\nHe could imagine the poor mute hiding in a corner, crying as enemies\nflooded the tower. Dabbid had become kind of a mascot for Bridge Four.\nOne of the first men Kaladin had saved. Dabbid represented what had been\ndone to them, and the fact that they’d survived it. Wounded, but still alive.\nDabbid resisted as Rlain tugged him toward the water trough. The\nshorter bridgeman leaned in, then—remarkably—spoke.\n“Rlain,” Dabbid said. “Please help. Kaladin is asleep, and he won’t wake\nup. I think … I think he’s dying.”\nThe singers first put Jezrien into a gemstone. They think they are\nclever, discovering they can trap us in those. It only took them seven\nthousand years.\nKaladin existed in a place where the wind hated him.\nHe remembered fighting in the market, then swimming through the well.\nHe vaguely remembered running out into the storm—wanting to let go and\ndrop away.\nBut no, he couldn’t give up. He’d climbed the outside of the tower.\nBecause he’d known that if he fled, he’d leave Dabbid and Teft alone. If he\nfled, he’d leave Syl—maybe forever. So he’d climbed and …\nAnd the Stormfather’s voice?\nNo, Dalinar’s voice.\nThat had been … days ago? Weeks? He didn’t know what had happened"

The faces of those he loved\nappeared in haunting shadows, each one begging for help. Flashes of light\nburned his skin, blinded him. The light was angry. And though Kaladin\nlonged to escape the darkness, each new flash trained him to be more afraid\nof the light.\nThe worst part was the wind. The wind that hated him. It flayed him,\nslamming him against the rocks as he tried to find a hiding place to escape\nit.\nHate, it whispered. Hate. Hate hate.\nEach time the wind spoke, it broke something inside Kal. Ever since he\ncould remember—since childhood—he had loved the wind. The feel of it\non his skin meant he was free. Meant he was alive. It brought new scents,\nclean and fresh. The wind had always been there, his friend, his companion,\nhis ally. Until one day it had come to life and started talking to him.\nIts hatred crushed him. Left him trembling. He screamed for Syl, then\nremembered that he’d abandoned her. He couldn’t remember how he’d\ncome to this terrible place, but he remembered that. Plain as a dagger in his\nchest.\nHe’d left Syl alone, to lose herself because he’d gotten too far away.\nHe’d abandoned the wind.\nThe wind crashed into him, pressing him against something hard. A rock\nformation? He was … somewhere barren. No sign of rockbuds or vines in\nthe flashes of terrifying light. Only endless windswept, rocky crags. It\nreminded him of the Shattered Plains, but with far more variation to the\nelevations. Peaks and precipices, red and grey.\nSo many holes and tunnels. Surely there was a place to hide. Please. Just\nlet me rest. For a minute.\nHe pushed forward, holding to the rock wall, trying not to stumble. He\nhad to fight the wind. The terrible wind.\nHate. Hate. Hate.\nLightning flashed, blinding him. He huddled beside the rock as the wind\nblew stronger. When he started moving, he could see a bit better.\nSometimes it was pure darkness. Sometimes he could see a little, though\nthere was no light source he could locate. Merely a persistent directionless\nillumination. Like … like another place he couldn’t remember.\nHide. He had to hide.\nKal pushed off the wall, struggling against the wind. Figures appeared.\nTeft begging to know why Kal hadn’t rescued him. Moash pleading for help\nprotecting his grandparents. Lirin dying as Roshone executed him.\nKal tried to ignore them, but if he squeezed his eyes shut, their cries\nbecame louder. So he forced himself forward, searching for shelter. He\nstruggled up a short incline—but as soon as he reached the top, the wind\nreversed and blew him from behind, casting him down the other side. He\nlanded on his shoulder, scraping up his arm as he slid across the stone.\nHate. Hate. Hate.\nKal forced himself to his knees. He … he didn’t give up. He … wasn’t a\nperson who was allowed to give up. Was that right? It was hard … hard to\nremember."

A\nplace to hide.\nHe staggered forward, exhausted. How long had it been since he’d slept?\nTruly slept? For years, Kal had stumbled from one nightmare to another. He\nlived on willpower alone. But what would happen when he ran out of\nstrength? What would happen when he simply … couldn’t?\n“Syl?” he croaked. “Syl?”\nThe wind slammed into him and knocked him off balance, shoving him\nright up to the rim of a chasm. He teetered on the edge, terrified of the\ndarkness below—but the wind didn’t give him a choice. It pushed him\nstraight into the void.\nHe tumbled and fell, slamming into rocks along the chasm wall, denied\npeace even while falling. He hit the bottom with a solid crack to his head\nand a flash of light.\nHate. Hate. Hate.\nHe lay there. Letting it rail. Letting it pummel him. Was it time? Time to\nfinally let go?\nHe forced himself to look up. And there—in the distance along the\nbottom of the chasm—he saw something beautiful. A pure white light. A\nlonging warmth. The sight of it made him weep and cry out, reaching for it.\nSomething real. Something that didn’t hate him.\nHe needed to get to that light.\nThe fall had broken him. One arm didn’t work, and his legs were a mess\nof agony. He began crawling, dragging himself along with his working arm.\nThe wind redoubled its efforts, trying to force him back, but now that\nKaladin had seen the light, he had to keep going. He gritted his teeth\nagainst the pain and hauled himself forward. Inch after inch. Defying the\nscreaming wind, ignoring the shadows of dying friends.\nKeep. Moving.\nThe light drew closer, and he longed to enter it. That place of warmth,\nthat place of peace. He heard … a sound. A serene tone that wasn’t spiteful\nwind or whispered accusations.\nCloser. Closer.\nA little … farther …\nHe was just ten feet away. He could …\nSuddenly, Kaladin began to sink. He felt the ground change, becoming\nliquid. Crem. The rock had somehow become crem, and it was sucking him\ndown, collapsing beneath him.\nHe shouted, stretching his good arm toward the glowing pool of light.\nThere was nothing to climb on, nothing to hold on to. He panicked, sinking\ndeeper. The crem covered him, filling his mouth as he screamed—begging\n—reaching a trembling hand toward the light.\nUntil he slipped under the surface and was again in the suffocating\ndarkness. As he sank away, Kal realized that the light had never been there\nfor him to reach. It had been a lie, meant to give him a moment of hope in\nthis awful, horrible place. So that hope could be taken.

Another\nperson among the shadows and lies. Was this … was this Honor? The\nAlmighty himself?\nThe figure pulled him into the light, and the rest of the crem vanished,\nleaving a hint of a taste in Kaladin’s mouth. The figure deposited Kaladin\non a small rock situated like a seat. As it stepped back, the figure drew in\ncolor, the light fading away, revealing …\nWit.\nKaladin blinked, glancing around. He was at the bottom of a chasm, yes,\nbut inside a bubble of light. Outside, the wind still raged—but it couldn’t\naffect this place, this moment of peace.\nHe put a hand to his head, realizing he didn’t hurt any longer. In fact, he\ncould see now that he was in a nightmare. He was asleep. He must have\nfallen unconscious after fleeing into the tempest.\nStorms … What kind of fever did he have to prompt such terrible\ndreams? And why could he see it all so clearly now?\nWit looked up at the tumultuous sky far above, beyond the chasm rims.\n“This isn’t playing fair. Not fair at all…”\n“Wit?” Kaladin asked. “How are you here?”\n“I’m not,” Wit said. “And neither are you. This is another planet, or it\nlooks like one—and not a pleasant one, mind you. The kind without lights.\nNo Stormlight ones, gaseous ones, or even electric ones. Damn place barely\nhas an atmosphere.”\nHe glanced at Kaladin, then smiled. “You’re asleep. The enemy is\nsending you a vision, similar to those the Stormfather sent Dalinar. I’m not\ncertain how Odium isolated you though. It’s hard for Shards to invade\nminds like this except in a specific set of circumstances.”\nHe shook his head, hands on his hips, as if he were regarding a sloppy\npainting. Then he settled down on a stool beside a fire that Kaladin only\nnow saw. A warm, inviting fire that completely banished the chill, radiating\nstraight through Kaladin’s bones to his soul. A pot of simmering stew sat on\ntop, and Wit stirred it, sending spiced fragrances into the air.\n“Rock’s stew,” Kaladin said.\n“Old Horneater recipe.”\n“Take everything you have, and put him in pot,” Kaladin said, smiling as\nWit handed him a bowl of steaming stew. “But it’s not real. You just told\nme.”\n“Nothing is real,” Wit said. “At least by one measure of philosophy. So\nenjoy what you seem to be able to eat and don’t complain.”\nKaladin did so, taking the most wonderful bite of stew he’d ever tasted."

I’m sorry.”\n“Worse than this?”\n“Unfortunately.”\n“I’m not strong enough, Wit,” Kaladin whispered. “It has all been a lie.\nI’ve never been strong enough.”\nWit took a bite of his stew, then nodded.\n“You … agree?” Kaladin asked.\n“You know better than I what your limits are,” Wit said. “It’s not such a\nterrible thing, to be too weak. Makes us need one another. I should never\ncomplain if someone recognizes their failings, though it might put me out of\na job if too many share your wisdom, young bridgeman.”\n“And if all of this is too much for me?” Kaladin asked. “If I can’t keep\nfighting? If I just … stop? Give up?”\n“Are you close to that?”\n“Yes,” Kaladin whispered.\n“Then best eat your stew,” Wit said, pointing with his spoon. “A man\nshouldn’t lie down and die on an empty stomach.”\nKaladin waited for more, some insight or encouragement. Wit merely\nate, and so Kaladin tried to do the same. Though the stew was perfect, he\ncouldn’t enjoy it. Not while knowing that the storm awaited him. That he\nwasn’t free of it, that it was going to get worse.\n“Wit?” Kaladin finally said. “Do you … maybe have a story you could\ntell me?”\nWit froze, spoon in his mouth. He stared at Kaladin, lowering his hand,\nleaving the spoon between his lips—before eventually opening his mouth to\nstare slack-jawed, the spoon falling into his waiting hand.\n“What?” Kaladin asked. “Why are you so surprised?”\n“Well,” Wit said, recovering. “It’s simply that … I’ve been waiting for\nsomeone to actually ask. They never seem to.” He grinned, then leaned\nforward and lowered his voice. “There is an inn,” he whispered, “that you\ncannot find on your own.

If you find the\nplace and wander inside, you’ll meet a young man behind the bar. He has\nno name. He cannot tell it to you, should he want to—it’s been taken from\nhim. But he’ll know you, as he knows everyone who enters the inn. He’ll\nlisten to everything you want to tell him—and you will want to talk to him.\nAnd if you ask him for a story, he’ll share one.

He was just … well, Wit.\n“This story,” Wit said, “is a meaningless one. You must not search for a\nmoral. It isn’t that kind of story, you see. It’s the other kind of story.”\nThe Cryptic held up a flute, and Kaladin recognized it. “Your flute!” he\nsaid. “You found it?”\n“This is a dream, idiot,” Wit said. “It’s not real.”\n“Oh,” Kaladin said. “Right.”\n“I’m real!” the Cryptic said with a musical, feminine voice. “Not\nimaginary at all! Unfortunately, I am irrational! Ha ha!” She began to play\nthe flute, moving her fingers along it—and while soft music came out,\nKaladin wasn’t certain what she was doing to produce the sounds. She\ndidn’t have lips.\n“This story,” Wit said, “is called ‘The Dog and the Dragon.’”\n“The … what and the what?” Kaladin said. “Or is this not the part where\nI speak yet?”\n“You people,” Wit said. “A dog is a hound, like an axehound.” He held\nup his palm, and a creature appeared in it, four-legged and furry, like a mink\n—only larger, and with a different face shape.\n“It is funny, you can’t realize,” Wit said. “Humans will selectively breed\nfor the same traits regardless of the planet they’re on. But you can’t be\namazed at the convergent examples of domestication across the cosmere.\nYou can’t know any of this, because you live on a giant ball of rock full of\nslime where everything is wet and cold all the time. This is a dog, Kaladin.\nThey’re fluffy and loyal and wonderful. This, on the other hand, is a\ndragon.”\nA large beast appeared in his other hand, like a chasmfiend—except with\nenormous outstretched wings and only four legs. It was a brilliant\npearlescent color, with silver running along the contours of its body. It also\nhad smaller chitinous bits than a chasmfiend—in fact, its body was covered\nwith little pieces of carapace that looked smooth to the touch. It stood\nproud, with a prominent chest and a regal bearing.\n“I know of just one on Roshar,” Wit noted, “and she prefers to hide her\ntrue form. This story isn’t about her, however, or any of the dragons I’ve\nmet. In fact, the dragon is barely in the story, and I’d kindly ask you not to\ncomplain about that part, because there’s really nothing I can do about it\nand you’ll only annoy Design.”"

I drew up a proof\nof it!” The music continued playing as she spoke, and the way she moved\nher fingers on the flute seemed completely random.\n“One day, the dog saw the dragon flying overhead,” Wit continued,\nsending the illusory dragon soaring above his hand.\nKaladin was glad for the story. Anything to keep his attention off the\nhateful wind, which he could faintly hear outside, howling as if eager to\nrush into the bubble of light and assault him.\n“The dog marveled,” Wit said, “as one might expect. He had never seen\nanything so majestic or grand. The dragon soared in the sky, shimmering\nwith iridescent colors in the sunlight. When it curved around and passed\nabove the dog, it called out a mighty challenge, demanding in the human\ntongue that all acknowledge its beauty.\n“The dog watched this from atop a hill. Now, he wasn’t particularly\nlarge, even for a dog. He was white, with brown spots and floppy ears. Not\nof any specific breed or lineage, and small enough that the other dogs often\nmocked him. He was a common variety of a common species of a common\nanimal that most people would rightfully ignore.\n“But when this dog stared at the dragon and heard the mighty boast, he\ncame to a realization. Today, he had encountered something he’d always\nwished for but never known. Today he’d seen perfection, and had been\npresented with a goal. From today, nothing else mattered.\n“He was going to become a dragon.”\n“Hint,” Design whispered to Kaladin, “that’s impossible. A dog can’t\nbecome a dragon.”\n“Design!” Wit said, turning on her. “What did I tell you about spoiling\nthe ending of stories!”\n“Something stupid, so I forgot it!” she said, her pattern bursting outward\nlike a blooming flower.\n“Don’t spoil stories!” Wit said.\n“That’s stupid. The story is really long. He needs to hear the ending so\nhe’ll know it’s worth listening all the way.”\n“That’s not how this works,” Wit said. “It needs drama. Suspense.\nSurprise.”\n“Surprises are dumb,” she said. “He should be informed if a product is\ngood or not before being asked to commit. Would you like a similar surprise\nat the market? Oh, you can’t buy a specific food. You have to carry a sack\nhome, cut it open, then find out what you bought. Drama. Suspense!”\nWit gave Kaladin a beleaguered look. “I have bonded,” he said, “a literal\nmonster.” He made a flourish, and a Lightweaving appeared between them\nagain, showing the dog on a hilltop covered in grass that looked dead, since\nit didn’t move. The dog was staring upward at the dragon, which was\ngrowing smaller and smaller as it flew away.\n“The dog,” Wit continued, “sat upon that hilltop through an entire night"

The dog was staring upward at the dragon, which was\ngrowing smaller and smaller as it flew away.\n“The dog,” Wit continued, “sat upon that hilltop through an entire night\nand day, staring. Thinking. Dreaming. Finally, he returned to the farm\nwhere he lived among others of his kind. These farm dogs all had jobs,\nchasing livestock or guarding the perimeter, but he—as the smallest—was\nseldom given any duty. Perhaps to another this would be liberating. To him\nit had always been humiliating.\n“As any problem to overcome is merely a set of smaller problems to\novercome in a sequence, he divided his goal of becoming a dragon into\nthree steps. First, he would find a way to have colorful scales like the\ndragon. Second, he would learn to speak the language of men like the\ndragon. Third, he would learn to fly like the dragon.”\nWit made the scene unfold in front of Kaladin. A colorful land, with\nthick green grass that wasn’t dead after all—it simply didn’t move except in\nthe wind. Creatures unlike any Kaladin had ever seen, furry and strange.\nExotic.\nThe little dog walked into a wooden structure—a barn, though it hadn’t\nbeen built with stone on the east side to withstand storms. It barely looked\nwaterproof. How would they keep the grain from spoiling? Kaladin cocked\nhis head at this oddity as the dog encountered a tall man in work clothing\nsorting through bags of seeds.\n“The dog chose the scales first,” Wit continued, accompanied by the\nquiet flute music, “as it seemed the easiest, and he wanted to begin his\ntransformation with an early victory. He knew the farmer owned many\nseeds in a variety of colors, and they were the shape of little scales. Because\nhe was not a thief, the dog did not take these—but he asked the other\nanimals where the farmer obtained new ones.\n“It turns out, the farmer could make seeds by putting them in the ground,\nwaiting for plants to grow, then taking more seeds from the stalks. Knowing\nthis, the dog borrowed some seeds and did the same, accompanying the\nfarmer’s eldest son on his daily work. As the youth worked, the dog moved\nalongside him, digging holes for seeds with his paws and planting them\ncarefully with his mouth.”\nIt was an amusing scene, watching the dog work. Not only because the\nanimal did all this with feet and snout—but because the ground parted\nwhen the dog pawed at it. It wasn’t made of stone, but something else.\n“This is in Shinovar, isn’t it?” Kaladin asked. “Sigzil told me about\nground like that.”\n“Hush,” Wit said. “This isn’t the part where you talk. The farmer’s eldest\nson found the dog’s actions quite amusing—then incredible as the dog went\nout each day, gripping a watering can in his teeth. The little dog watered\neach seed, just as the farmer did. He learned to weed and fertilize. And\neventually the dog was rewarded with his own small crop of colorful seeds.\n“After replacing what he’d borrowed from the farmer, the dog got\nhimself wet and rolled in his seeds, sticking them all over his body. He then\npresented himself to the other dogs.\n“‘Do you admire my wonderful new scales?’ he asked his fellow"

Go back to being a dog.’”\nKaladin put a spoonful of stew into his mouth, staring at the illusion. The\nway the colors worked was mesmerizing, though he had to admit the dog\ndid look silly covered in seeds.\n“The dog slunk away, feeling foolish and hurt. He had failed at his first\ntask, to have scales like a dragon. The dog, however, was not daunted.\nSurely if he could speak with the grand voice of a dragon, they would all\nsee. And so, the dog spent his free time watching the children of the farmer.\nThere were three. The eldest son, who helped in the fields. The middle\ndaughter, who helped with the animals, and the toddler—who was too\nyoung to help, but was learning to speak.”\nWit made the family appear, working in the yard—the farmer’s wife,\nwho was taller than the farmer. A youth, lanky and assiduous. A daughter\nwho would someday share her mother’s height. A baby who toddled around\nthe yard, tended by them all as they did their chores.\n“This,” Wit noted, “is almost too easy.”\n“Too easy?” Kaladin asked, absently taking another bite of stew.\n“For years, I’ve had to make do with hints of illusions. Suggesting\nscenes. Leaving most to the imagination. Now, having the power to do\nmore, I find it less satisfying.\n“Anyway, the dog figured that the best way to learn the language of men\nwas to study their youngest child. So the dog played with the baby, stayed\nwith him, and listened as he began to form words. The dog played with the\ndaughter too, helped her with yard work. He soon found he could\nunderstand her, if he tried hard. But he couldn’t form words.\n“He tried so hard to speak as they did, but his mouth could not make that\nkind of speech. His tongue did not work like a human tongue. Eventually,\nwhile watching the tall and serious daughter, he noticed she could make the\nwords of humans on paper.\n“The dog was overjoyed by this. It was a way to speak without having a\nhuman tongue! The dog joined her at the table where she studied, inspecting\nthe letters as she made them. He failed many times, but eventually learned\nto scratch the letters in the dirt himself.\n“The farmer and his family thought this an amazing trick. The dog was\nsure he had found a way to prove he was becoming a dragon. He returned to\nthe other dogs in the field and showed them his writing ability by writing\ntheir names in the dirt.\n“They, however, could not read the words. When the dog explained what\nwriting was, they laughed. ‘This is not the loud and majestic voice of a\ndragon!’ the dogs said. ‘This is speaking so quietly, nobody can hear it! You\nlook silly and stupid. Go back to being a dog.’\n“They left the dog to stare at his writing as rain began to fall, washing\nthe words away. He realized they were correct.

He had failed to speak with\nthe proud and powerful voice of the dragon.”\nThe image of the dog in the rain felt far too familiar to Kaladin. Far too\npersonal.\n“But there was still hope,” Wit said. “If the dog could just fly. If he could\nachieve this feat, the dogs would have to acknowledge his transformation.\n“This task seemed even harder than the previous two. However, the dog\nhad seen a curious device in the barn. The farmer would tie bales of hay\nwith a rope, then raise or lower them using a pulley in the rafters.\n“This was essentially flying, was it not? The bales of hay soared in the\nair. And so, the dog practiced pulling on the rope himself, and learned the\nmechanics of the device. He found that the pulley could be balanced with a\nweight on the other side, which made the bales of hay lower slowly and\nsafely.\n“The dog took his leash and tied it around him to make a harness, like\nthe ones that wrapped up the hay. Then he tied a sack slightly lighter than\nhe was to the rope, creating a weight to balance him. After using his mouth\nto tie the rope to his harness, he climbed to the top of the barn’s loft, and\ncalled for the other dogs to come in. When they arrived, he leaped\ngracefully off the loft.\n“It worked! The dog lowered down slowly, striking a magnificent pose in\nthe air. He was flying! He soared like the dragon had! He felt the air around\nhim, and knew the sensation of being up high, with everything below him.\nWhen he landed, he felt so proud and so free.\n“Then the other dogs laughed the loudest they had ever laughed. ‘That is\nnot flying like a dragon!’ they said. ‘You fell slowly. You looked so stupid\nand silly. Go back to being a dog.’\n“This, at long last, crushed the dog’s hopes. He realized the truth. A dog\nlike him simply could not become a dragon. He was too small, too quiet,\ntoo silly.”\nFrankly, the sight of the dog being lowered on the rope had looked a bit\nsilly. “They were right,” Kaladin said. “That wasn’t flying.”\nWit nodded.\n“Oh, is this the place where I talk?” Kaladin said.\n“If you wish.”\n“I don’t wish. Get on with the story.”\nWit grinned, then leaned forward, waving in the air and making the\nsounds of shouting come from a distant part of the illusion, not yet visible.\n“What was that? The dog looked up, confused. He heard noises. Sudden\nshouting? Yells of panic?\n“The dog raced out of the barn to find the farmer and his family huddled\naround the small farmyard well, which was barely wide enough for the\nbucket. The dog put his paws up on the edge of the well and looked down.\nFar below, in the deep darkness of the hole, he heard crying and splashing.”\nKaladin leaned forward, staring into the darkness. A pitiful, gurgling cry\nwas barely audible over the splashing.\n“The littlest child of the farmer and his wife had fallen into the well,”"

The family screamed and wept. There\nwas nothing to be done. Or … was there?\n“In a flash, the dog knew what to do. He bit the bucket off the well’s\nrope, then had the eldest son tie the rope to his harness. He wrote ‘lower\nme’ in the dirt, then hopped up onto the rim of the well. Finally, he threw\nhimself into the well as the farmer grabbed the crank.\n“Lowered down on this rope, the dog ‘flew’ into the darkness. He found\nthe baby all the way underwater, but shoved his snout in and took hold of\nthe baby’s clothing with his teeth. A short time later, when the family pulled\nhim back up, the dog appeared holding the littlest child: wet, crying, but\nvery much alive.\n“That night, the family set a place for the little dog at their table and\ngave him a sweater to keep him warm, his name written across the front\nwith letters he could read. They served a feast with food the dog had helped\ngrow. They gave him some of the cake celebrating the birthday of the child\nwhose life he had saved.\n“That night, it rained on the other dogs, who slept outside in the cold\nbarn, which leaked. But the little dog snuggled into a warm bed beside the\nfire, hugged by the farmer’s children, his belly full. And as he did, the dog\nsadly thought to himself, ‘I could not become a dragon. I am an utter and\ncomplete failure.’\n“The end.”\nWit clapped his hands, and the images vanished. He gave a seated bow.\nDesign lowered her flute and flared out her pattern again, as if to give her\nown bow.\nThen Wit picked up his bowl of stew and continued eating.\n“Wait,” Kaladin said, standing. “That’s it?”\n“Did you miss ‘the end’ at the end?” Design said. “It indicates that is the\nend.”\n“What kind of ending is that?” Kaladin said. “The dog decides he’s a\nfailure?”\n“Endings are an art,” Wit said loftily. “A precise and unquestionable art,\nbridgeman. Yes, that is the ending.”\n“Why did you tell me this?” Kaladin demanded.\n“You asked for a story.”\n“I wanted a useful story!” he said, waving his hand. “Like the story of\nthe emperor on the island, or of Fleet who kept running.”\n“You didn’t specify that,” Wit said. “You said you wanted a story. I\nprovided one. That is all.”\n“That’s the wrong ending,” Kaladin said. “That dog was incredible. He\nlearned to write. How many animals can write, on any world?”\n“Not many, I should say,” Wit noted.\n“He learned to farm and to use tools,” Kaladin said. “He saved a child’s\nlife. That dog is a storming hero.”\n“The story wasn’t about him trying to be a hero,” Wit said. “It was about\nhim trying to be a dragon. In which, pointedly, he failed.”"

I have violated our agreement,\nwhich exposes me to his direct action. I’d rather not be killed, as I have\nseven more people I wanted to insult today.”\nKaladin nodded, standing up again.

He felt a\npush against his back as Wit sent him forward—then the light vanished,\nalong with all it contained.\nSEVEN YEARS AGO\nEshonai tipped her head back, feeling water stream off her carapace\nskullplate. Returning to warform after so long in workform felt like\nrevisiting a familiar clearing hidden in the trees, rarely encountered but\nalways waiting for her. She did like this form. She would not see it as a\nprison.\nShe met Thude and Rlain as they emerged from hollows in the stone\nwhere they too had returned to this form. Many of her friends had never left\nit. Warform was convenient for many reasons, though Eshonai didn’t like it\nquite as well as workform. There was something about the aggression this\nform provoked in her. She worried she would seek excuses to fight.\nThude stretched, humming to Joy. “Feels good,” he said. “I feel alive in\nthis form.”\n“Too alive,” Rlain said. “Do the rhythms sound louder to you?”\n“Not to me,” Thude said.\nEshonai shook her head. She didn’t hear the rhythms any differently.\nIndeed, she’d been wondering if—upon adopting this form again—she’d\nhear the pure tone of Roshar as she did the first time. She hadn’t.\n“Shall we?” she asked, gesturing toward the spreading plateaus. Rlain\nstarted toward one of the bridges, but Thude sang loudly to Amusement and\ncharged the nearby chasm, leaping and soaring over it with an incredible\nbound.\nEshonai dashed after him to do the same. Each form brought with it a\ncertain level of instinctual understanding. When she reached the edge, her\nbody knew what to do. She sprang in a powerful leap, the air whistling\nthrough the grooves in her carapace and flapping the loose robe she’d worn\ninto the storm.\nShe landed with a solid crunch, her feet grinding stone as she slid to a\nstop. The Rhythm of Confidence thrummed in her ears, and she found\nherself grinning. She had missed that. Rlain landed next to her, a hulking\nfigure with black and red skin patterns forming an intricate marbling. He\nhummed to Confidence as well.\n“Come on!” Thude shouted from nearby. He leaped another chasm.\nAttuning Joy, Eshonai ran after him. Together the three of them chased\nand dashed, climbed and soared—spanning chasms, climbing up and over\nrock formations, sprinting across plateaus. The Shattered Plains felt like a\nplayground.\nThis must be what islands and oceans are like, she thought as she\nsurveyed the Plains from up high. She’d heard about them in songs, and\nshe’d always imagined an ocean as a huge network of streams moving\nbetween sections of land."

Complementary emotions, in her\nexperience.\nShe dropped from the rock formation and landed on the plateau, then\nbounded after Thude. How far would she have to travel to find those\noceans? Judging by the map, only a few weeks to the east. Once such a\ndistance would have been daunting, but now she’d made the trek all the\nway to Kholinar and back. The trip to the Alethi capital had been one of the\nsweetest and most exhilarating experiences of her life. So many new places.\nSo many wonderful people. So many strange plants, strange sights, strange\nfoods to taste.\nWhen they’d fled, the same wonders had become threats overnight. The\nentire trip home had been a blur of marching, sleeping, and foraging in\nhuman fields.\nEshonai reached another chasm and leaped, trying to recapture her\nexcitement. She increased her pace, coming up even with Thude and\neventually passing him—before the two of them pulled to a halt to wait for\nRlain, who had slowed a few plateaus back. He had always been a careful\none, and he seemed better able to control the inclinations of the new form.\nHer heart racing, Eshonai reached out of habit to wipe her brow—but\nthis form didn’t have sweat on her forehead to drip into her eyes. Instead,\nthe carapace armor trapped air from her forward motion, then pushed it up\nunderneath to cool her skin.\nThe awesome energy of the form meant she could probably have kept\nrunning for hours before feeling any real strain. Perhaps longer. Indeed, the\nwarforms during their flight from Alethkar had carried food for the others\nand still moved faster than the workforms.\nAt the same time, Eshonai was getting hungry. She remembered well\nhow much food this form required at each meal.\nThude leaned against a high rock formation as they waited, watching\nsome windspren play in the air. Eshonai wished she’d brought her book for\ndrawing maps of the Plains. She’d found it in the human market of Kholinar\n—such a small, simple thing. It had been expensive by Alethi standards, but\noh so cheap by her standards. An entire book of papers? All for a few little\nbits of emerald?\nShe’d seen steel weapons there too. Sitting in the market. For sale. The\nlisteners protected, polished, and revered each weapon they’d found on the\nPlains—keeping them for generations, passed down from parent to child.\nThe humans had entire stalls of them.\n“This is going to go poorly for us, isn’t it?” Thude asked.\nEshonai realized she’d been humming to the Lost. She stopped, but met\nhis eyes and knew that he knew. Together they walked around the stone\nformation and looked westward, toward the cities that had for centuries\nbeen listener homes. Dark smoke filled the air—the Alethi burning wood as\nthey set up enormous cookfires and settled into their camps."

If we\nhave to fight them, this terrain will heavily favor us.”\n“Did you really have to do it though?” Thude asked to Pleading. “Did\nyou need to have him killed?”\nShe’d answered this before, but she didn’t avoid the responsibility.

We might not\neven have to fight them. We can harvest gemstones from the greatshells and\nspeed crop growth. The humans can’t leap these chasms, and so they’ll have\ntrouble ever getting to us. We’ll be safe.”\n“We’ll be trapped,” Thude said. “In the center of these Plains. For\nmonths, perhaps years. You’re fine with that, Eshonai?”\nRlain finally caught up to them, jogging over and humming to\nAmusement—perhaps he thought the two of them silly for speeding ahead.\nEshonai looked away from Thude and stared out across the Plains—not\ntoward the humans, but toward the ocean, the Origin. Places she could have\ngone. Places she’d planned to go. Thude knew her too well. He understood\nhow much it hurt to be trapped here.\nThey will strike inward, she thought. The humans won’t come all this\nway to turn around because of a few chasms. They have resources we can\nonly imagine, and there are so many of them. They’ll find a way to get to us.\nEscaping out the other side of the Plains wasn’t an option either. If the\nchasmfiends there didn’t get them, the humans eventually would. To flee\nwould be to abandon the natural fortification of the Plains.\n“I’ll do what I have to, Thude,” Eshonai said to Determination. “I’ll do\nwhat is right whatever the cost. To us. To me.”\n“They have fought wars,” Thude said. “They have generals. Great\nmilitary thinkers. We’ve had warform for only a year.”\n“We’ll learn,” Eshonai said, “and create our own generals. Our ancestors\npaid with their very minds to bring us freedom. If the humans find a way to\ncome for us in here, we will fight. Until we persuade the humans that the"

Forever.”\n* * *\nVenli gathered her friends around, humming softly to Craving as she\nrevealed the gemstones in her hands. Voidspren. Five of them, trapped as\nUlim had been when first brought to her.\nInside her gemheart, he hummed words of encouragement. Ever since\nthe events at the human city, he’d treated her with far more respect. And\nhe’d never again abandoned her. The longer he remained, the better she\ncould hear the new rhythms. The rhythms of power.\nShe had claimed this section of Narak—the city at the center of the\nPlains—for her scholars. Friends who she and Ulim had determined, after\ncareful discussion, shared her hunger for a better world. Trustworthy\nenough, she hoped. Once they had Voidspren in their gemhearts, she’d be\nfar more confident in their discretion.\n“What are they?” Demid asked, his hand resting on Venli’s shoulder.\nHe’d been the first and most eager to listen. He didn’t know everything,\nnaturally, but she was glad to have him. She felt stronger when he was\naround. Braver than Eshonai. After all, could Eshonai have ever taken this\nstep?\n“These hold spren,” Venli explained. “When you accept one into your\ngemheart, they’ll hold your current spren with them, keeping you in your\ncurrent form—but you’ll have a secret companion to help you. Guide you.\nTogether, we’re going to solve the greatest challenge our people have ever\nknown.”\n“Which is?” Tusa asked to Skepticism.\n“Our world is connected to another,” Venli explained, handing one\ngemstone to each of her friends. “A place called Shadesmar. Hundreds of\nspren exist there who can grant us the ability to harness the power of the\nstorms. They’ve traveled a long way, as part of a great storm. They’ve gone\nas far as they can on their own, however. Getting gemstones like these to\nour side takes enormous effort, and is impossible on a large scale.\n“So we need another way to bring those spren across. We’re going to\nfigure it out, then we’re going to persuade the rest of the listeners to join\nwith us in adopting forms of power. We’ll be smart; we won’t be ruled by\nthe spren this time around. We’ll rule them.\n“Eshonai and the others have foolishly thrown everyone into an\nunwanted war. So we have to take this step. We will be remembered as the\nones who saved our people.”\nOh … Father … Seven thousand years.\n“How could you not tell me this?” Radiant demanded as she knelt and\nshouted at the cube on the floor. “Restares is not only the honorspren’s High\nJudge, he’s one of the storming Heralds!”\n“You didn’t require the information at that time,” Mraize’s voice said.\n“Be Veil. She will understand.”"

She will understand.”\n“Veil is even more angry at you, Mraize,” Radiant said, standing up.\n“You sent us into a dangerous situation without proper preparation!\nWithholding this information wasted weeks while the three of us searched\nthe fortress like an idiot.”\n“We didn’t want you asking after a Herald,” Mraize said, his voice\nfrustratingly calm. “That might have alerted him. So far as we’re aware, he\nhasn’t figured out that we know his true identity. Gavilar may have known,\nbut no others in the Sons of Honor had an inkling that they served one of\nthe very beings they were seeking—in their naive ignorance—to restore to\nRoshar. The irony is quite poetic.”\n“Mmm…” Pattern said from beside the door, where he was watching for\nAdolin.\n“What?” Radiant asked him. “You like irony now too?”\n“Irony tastes good. Like sausage.”\n“And have you ever tasted sausage?”\n“I don’t believe I have a sense of taste,” Pattern said. “So irony tastes\nlike what I imagine sausage would taste like when I’m imagining tastes.”\nRadiant rubbed her forehead, looking back at the cube. So unfair. She\nwas accustomed to being able to stare down her troops, but one could not\nproperly glare at a man who talked to you out of a box.\n“You told us we’d know what to do when we found Restares,” Radiant\ntold Mraize. “Well, we are here now and we have no idea how to proceed.”\n“What did you do the moment you found out?” Mraize said.\n“Cursed your name.”\n“Then?”\n“Contacted you directly to curse at you some more.”\n“Which was the correct choice. See, you knew exactly what to do.”\nRadiant folded her arms, warm with anger. Frustration. And …\nadmittedly … embarrassment. She bled into being Veil, and the anger\nreturned.\n“The time has come,” she said, “for us to deal, Mraize.”\n“Deal? The deal has already been set. You do as I have requested, and\nyou will receive the offered reward—in addition to the practice and training\nyou are receiving under my hand.”\n“That is interesting,” Veil said. “Because I see this differently. I have\ncome all this way, through great hardship. Because of Adolin’s sacrifice,\nI’ve gained access to one of the most remote fortresses on Roshar. I have\nsucceeded where you explicitly told me your other agents have failed.\n“Now that I’m here, instead of receiving ‘training’ or ‘practice’ as you\nsay, I find that you’ve been withholding vital information from me. From\nmy perspective, there is no incentive to continue this arrangement, as the\npromised reward is of little interest to me. Even Shallan is questioning its\nvalue.\n“Your refusal to give me important information makes me question what\nelse you held back. Now I’m questioning if what I’m to do here is possibly\nagainst my interests, and the interests of those I love. So let me ask plainly.\nWhy am I really here? Why are you so interested in Kelek?

And why—\nexplicitly—should I continue on this path?”\nMraize did not respond immediately. “Hello, Veil,” he finally said. “I’m\nglad you came out to speak with me.”\n“Answer my questions, Mraize.”\n“First, it is time to open the cube,” Mraize said.\nVeil frowned. “The communication cube? I thought you said that would\nruin the thing.”\n“If you break into it, you will ruin it. Pick it up. Heft it. Listen for the\nside where my voice is weakest as I hum.”\nShe knelt beside the cube again and picked it up, listening to Mraize’s\nhumming voice. Yes … the sound was weaker from one direction.\n“I’ve found it,” she said.\n“Good,” Mraize said. “Put your hand on that plane of the cube and twist\nit to the right.”\nShe felt it click as she touched it. She suspected Mraize had done\nsomething to unlock the device from wherever he was. When she twisted\nthat plane of the cube, it turned easily and came off, revealing a small\ncompartment that contained an intricate metal dagger with a gemstone on\nthe end of the grip.\n“So you do want me to kill him,” she said.\n“One cannot kill a Herald,” Mraize said. “They are immortal. Do not\nthink of Kelek as a person. He is an ageless, eternal spren formed of\nHonor’s substance and will. He is as gravity or light. Force, not man.”\n“And you want me to stab that force with this knife,” Veil said, undoing\nthe straps and prying it out from the cube. The cavity was only a small part\nof the hollow portion in the cube, and a layer of steel sectioned off the rest.\nMraize’s voice came from the sealed portion. How had he weighted the\ncube such that she didn’t feel one end was heavier than the other?\n“I want you,” he said, “to collect the soul of Kelek, also known as\nRestares. The knife will trap his essence in that gemstone.”\n“That seems overly cruel,” Veil said, looking over the knife.\n“Cruel like the spanreeds you so eagerly use, despite the spren trapped\ninside? It is no different. The being called Kelek is a receptacle of\nincredible knowledge. Gemstone imprisonment will not hurt him, and we\nwill be able to communicate with him.”\n“We have two other Heralds in the tower,” Veil said. “I could ask them\nanything you want to know.”\n“You think they’d answer? How useful have they been, talking to\nJasnah? Talenelat is completely insane, and Shalash is deceptively reticent.\nThey talk of their Oathpact, yes, and fighting the Fused—but rarely reveal\nanything practical.”\n“This isn’t very persuasive,” Veil said. “Yes, I know what you want me\nto do—but I suspected it from the beginning. If you want me to do this, I\nneed to know why. What specifically do you expect to learn from him?”\n“Our master, Thaidakar, has an … affliction similar to that of the"

He needs access to a Herald to learn more about his state so he\nmight save himself from the worst of its effects.”\n“That’s not good enough,” Veil said. “Radiant and Shallan won’t let me\ndo your dirty work for such a petty reason.” She put the dagger back in the\ncube. “I came here to report on Restares’s location. Shallan specifically told\nyou we wouldn’t kill him—and yes, I count stabbing him with this device\nas the same thing.”\n“Little knife,” Mraize said, his voice growing softer, “why did Sadeas\nneed to die?”\nShe hesitated, her hand still on the dagger, which she was trying to\nreattach to the straps in the cube.\n“This being,” Mraize continued, “that they call Kelek is a monster. He,\nalong with the other eight, abandoned their Oathpact and stranded Talenelat\n—the Bearer of Agonies—alone in Damnation, to withstand torture for\nthousands of years. The enemy has returned, but have the Heralds come to\nhelp? No. At best they hide. At worst, their madness leads them to hasten\nthe world’s destruction.\n“Kelek has become indecisive to the point of madness. And like most of\nthem, he is afraid. He wants to escape his duties. He worked with Gavilar\nknowing full well that doing so would cause the return of the Fused and the\nend of our peace, because he hoped to find a way to escape this world. A\nway to abandon us as he had already abandoned his oaths and his friends.\n“He possesses knowledge essential to our fight against the invaders.\nHowever, he will not share it willingly. He hides himself away in the\nworld’s most remote fortress and tries to pretend there is no war, that he is\nnot culpable. He is. The only way to make him do his duty is to bring him\nback by force—and the best and easiest way to do that is to trap his soul.”\nStorms. That was a longer speech than she usually got out of Mraize.\nThere was passion, conviction to his voice. Veil almost felt persuaded.\n“I can’t move against him,” she said. “He is set to judge Adolin in this\ntrial. If Kelek vanished, that would throw all kinds of suspicion on us—and\nAdolin would most certainly be imprisoned. I can’t risk it.”\n“Hmm…” Mraize said. “If only there were a way that someone—having\nlocked away Kelek’s soul—could take his place. Wear his face. Pass\njudgment, vindicating your husband and commanding the honorspren to\njoin the war again. If only we had sent a person capable of single-handedly\nturning the tide of this war through the use of a targeted illusion.”\nIn that moment, Veil lost control to Shallan. Because what Mraize said\nhere … it made too much sense.\nOh storms, Shallan thought, growing cold. Stormfather above and\nNightwatcher below … He’s right. That is a solution to this problem. A way\nto let Adolin win. A way to bring the honorspren back."

She wanted to buck him\nfor that reason alone. If only what he said weren’t so logical. It would be\neasy to replace Kelek, assuming she could get some Stormlight.…\nNo, Veil warned. It’s not that easy. We’d have a difficult time\nimpersonating a Herald.\nWe’d do the replacement at the last moment, Shallan thought. On the\nfinal day of the trial—to reduce the amount of time we need to pretend, and\nto give us a few days to scout out his personality.\n“Killing Sadeas saved thousands of lives,” Mraize continued in his soft,\noily voice. “Delivering Kelek to us, sending the honorspren to bond\nWindrunners, could save millions.”\n“Veil isn’t certain we could imitate a Herald,” Shallan said.\n“The Herald is erratic,” Mraize said. “All of them are now. With a few\npointers, you could escape notice. Honorspren are not good at noticing\nsubterfuge—or at distinguishing what is odd behavior for humans, or those\nwho were once human. You can accomplish this. And after the trial, ‘Kelek’\ncould insist he has to visit Urithiru himself, leaving the spren completely\nignorant of what you’ve done.”\n“It would be wrong, Mraize. It feels wrong.”\n“Earlier, Veil demanded a deal. Though I normally reject this sort of talk,\nI find it encouraging that she did not demand money, or power. She wanted\ninformation, to know why she was doing what she did. You three are\nworthy hunters.\n“So I will revise the deal as requested. Perform as I ask here, and I will\nrelease you from your apprenticeship. You will become a full member of\nour organization—you will not only have access to the knowledge you seek,\nbut also have a say in what we are doing. Our grand plans.”\nInside, Veil perked up at this. But Shallan was surprised by how much\nshe responded to that offer. A full Ghostblood? That was the way … The\nway to …\n“Strike at a Herald,” she said. “It sounds wrong, Mraize. Very wrong.”\n“You are weak,” he said. “You know it.”\nShe bowed her head.\n“But part of you is not,” he continued. “A part that can be that strong.\nLet that side of you do what needs to be done. Save your husband, your\nkingdom, and your world all at once. Become that hunter, Shallan.\n“Become the knife.”\n* * *\nThe honorspren surrounding the High Judge made room for Adolin as he\napproached, Blended following behind. He didn’t miss the glares that many\nof them gave her. No, there was no love lost between the two varieties of\nspren.\nHe should probably feel reverence for the High Judge.

Many people back home\nthought of him as the Stormfather, and though that had never been true, he\nwas one of the most ancient beings in all of creation. A god to many. An\nimmortal soldier for justice and Honor.\nHe was also short, with thinning hair. He felt like the type of man you’d\nfind administering some minor city in the backwater of Alethkar. And if he\nwas anything like Ash or Taln, the two Heralds who now resided at\nUrithiru …\nWell, his acquaintance with those two caused Adolin to lower his\nexpectations in this particular case.\nKelek spoke with several honorspren leaders as they strolled up the\nlower portion of the western plane, entering a stone pathway made up of a\nmultitude of colored cobblestones vaguely in the pattern of a gust of wind.\nThe group paused as they saw Adolin ahead.\nHe removed his hand from his sword out of respect, then bowed to the\nHerald.\n“Hmm? A human?” Kelek said. “Why is he here? He looks dangerous,\nSekeir.”\n“He is,” said the honorspren beside Kelek. Sekeir was a leader of the\nfortress, and appeared as an ancient honorspren with a long blue-white\nbeard. “This is Adolin Kholin, son of Dalinar Kholin.”\n“The Bondsmith?” Kelek said, and shied away from Adolin. “Good\nheavens! Why have you let him in here?”\n“I have come, great one,” Adolin said, “to petition the honorspren for\ntheir aid in our current battle.”\n“Your current battle? Against Odium?” Kelek laughed. “Boy, you’re\ndoomed. You realize that, right? Tanavast is dead. Like, completely dead.\nThe Oathpact is broken somehow. The only thing left is to try to get off the\nship before it sinks.”\n“Holy Lord,” Sekeir said, “we let this one in because he offered to stand\ntrial in the stead of the humans, for the pain they have caused our people.”\n“You’re going to try him for the Recreance?” Kelek asked, looking\naround uncertainly at the others near him. “Isn’t that a bit extreme?”\n“He offered, Holy Lord.”\n“Not a smart one, is he?” Kelek looked to Adolin, who hesitantly pulled\nup from his bow. “Huh. You’ve gotten yourself in deep, boy. They take this\nkind of thing very seriously around here.”\n“I hope to show them, great one, that we are not their enemies. That the\nbest course forward is for them to join us in our fight. It is, one might say,\nthe honorable choice.”\n“Honor is dead,” Kelek snapped. “Aren’t you paying attention? This\nworld belongs to Odium now. He has his own storm, for heaven’s sake.”\nBlended nudged Adolin. Right. He was so distracted by Kelek that he’d\nforgotten the purpose of meeting with him.\n“Great one,” Adolin said, “I’ve decided to petition for a trial by witness.\nWould you be willing to grant me this?”\n“Trial by witness?” Kelek said. “Well, that would make this mess end"

Fine, boy, trial by witness it is. We can start it … um, the day\nafter tomorrow? Is that acceptable for everyone?”\nNo one objected.\n“Great,” Kelek said. “Day after tomorrow. Okay then.

Though few lighteyed judges were ever truly impartial, there\nwas an expectation that they’d try to act with honor before the eyes of the\nAlmighty. But this Herald basically told him the trial would be a sham. The\nman had made his judgment before hearing any arguments.\nHow on Roshar was that ever considered a deity? Adolin thought, in a\ndaze. The Heralds had fallen so far.\nEither that, or … perhaps these ten people had always been only that.\nPeople. After all, crowning a man a king or highprince didn’t necessarily\nmake him anything grander than he’d been.

Remember what you have\nforgotten.\nShe remembered sitting at her mother’s feet as a child, listening to the\nsongs. The music had flowed like water, etching patterns in her brain—\nmemories—like the passage of time etched canals in stone.\nListeners were not like humans, who grew slow as trees. Listeners grew\nlike vines, quick and eager. By age three, she’d been singing with her\nmother. By age ten, she’d been considered an adult. Venli remembered\nthose years—looking up to Eshonai, who seemed so big, although just a\nyear older than Venli. She had vague memories of holding her father’s\nfinger as he sang with her mother.\nShe remembered love. Family. Grandparents, cousins. How had she\nforgotten? As a child, ambition and love had been like two sides of her face,\neach with its own vibrant pattern. To the sound of Odium’s rhythms, one\nside had shone, while the other withered. She had become a person who\nwanted only to achieve her goals—not because those goals would help\nothers, but because of the goals themselves.\nIt was in that moment that Venli saw for herself the depth of his lies. He\nclaimed to be of all Passions, and yet where was the love she’d once felt?\nThe love for her mother? Her sister? Her friends? For a while, she’d even\nforgotten her love for Demid, though it had helped to awaken her.\nIt felt wrong to be using his Light to practice her Surgebinding, but the\nstones whispered that it was well. Odium and his tone had become part of\nRoshar, as Cultivation and Honor—who had not been created alongside the\nplanet—had become part of it. His power was natural, and no more wrong\nor right than any other part of nature.\nVenli searched for something else. The tone of Cultivation. Odium’s\nsong could suffuse her, fueling her powers and enflaming her emotions, but\nthat tone … that tone had belonged to her people long before he’d arrived.\nWhile she searched for it, she listened to her mother’s songs in her mind.\nLike chains, spiked into the stone so they’d remain strong during storms,\nthey reached backward through time. Through generations.\nTo her people, leaving the battlefield. Walking away rather than\ncontinuing to squabble over the same ground over and over. They hadn’t\nmerely rejected the singer gods, they’d rejected the conflict. Holding to\nfamily, singing to Love despite their dull forms, they’d left the war and\ngone a new way.\nThe tone snapped into her mind, Cultivation and Odium mixing into a\nharmony, and it thrummed through Venli. She opened her eyes as power\nspread from her through the stones. They began to shake and vibrate to the\nsound of her rhythm, liquid, forming peaks and valleys in time with the\nmusic.

Rock seemed so\nstable, so unchangeable, but if you saw it on the timescale of spren, it was\nalways changing. Deliberately. Over centuries. She had never known her\nancestors, but she knew their songs. She could sing those and imitate their\ncourage. Their love. Their wisdom.\nThe power slipped from her, as it always did. The tone faded, and her\ncontrol over the stone ended. She needed more practice and more Light.\nStill, she didn’t need Timbre’s encouraging thrum to keep her spirits high as\nshe stood. For she had in front of her, in miniature, a sculpture of her\nancestors striking out toward the unknown.\nMore, she had their songs. Because of her mother’s diligent and insistent\nteaching, the songs had not died with the listeners.\n* * *\nAn hour later, Venli walked the hallways much lower in the tower, waiting\nfor Leshwi.\nShe met with the Heavenly One almost every day. Raboniel knew the\nmeetings were happening, of course. And Leshwi knew that Raboniel knew.\nStill, Venli and Leshwi met in secret; it was all part of the dance of politics\nbetween the Fused.\nThey met as if by happenstance. Leshwi hovered solemnly through a\ncorridor at the right time, her long black train rustling against the stone.\nVenli fell into step beside her mistress.\n“The Pursuer has found the Windrunner’s parents, Ancient One,” Venli\nsaid. “I’m certain of it. He posted two nightform Regals at the Radiant\ninfirmary.”\n“Which ones?”\n“Urialin and Nistar.”\n“‘Light’ and ‘mystery,’” Leshwi said, translating their names from the\nancient language. Like many of the Regals, they had taken new names for\nthemselves upon their awakening. “Yes, this is a signal. But the Pursuer is\nnot that subtle; if you look, I suspect that Raboniel is the one who suggested\nthose two.”\n“What do we do?” Venli said to Anxiety.\n“Nothing, for now. My authority extends far enough to protect them.\nThis is merely a warning.”\n“Raboniel threatens to let the Pursuer have the humans,” Venli said.\n“That is why she posted those two guards. To lord her advantage over us.”\n“Perhaps,” Leshwi said, floating with her hands behind her back.\n“Perhaps not. Raboniel does not think like other Fused, Venli. She hears a\nmuch grander song. A skewed and twisted one, but one she seeks to sing\nwithout traditional regard for Odium’s plans or those of Honor, now dead.”\n“She makes her own side then,” Venli said. “She seeks to play both\narmies against one another and profit herself.”\n“Do not transpose your mortal ambitions upon Raboniel,” Leshwi said to\nRidicule. “You think too small, Venli, to understand her. I think too small to"

Regardless, you did well in bringing this to me. Watch for\nother signs like this.”\nThey reached the atrium, the hallway they’d been following merging\nwith it like a river flowing into a sea. Here, Heavenly Ones soared up and\ndown, delivering supplies to the scouts and Masked Ones on the upper\nfloors. Those continued to keep watch for Windrunners. The charade was\nwearing thin at this point; Raboniel was certain Dalinar Kholin had seen\nthrough it and knew something very wrong was happening at the tower.\nThe supplies to the upper floors could have been delivered via the lifts.\nHowever, Raboniel had put the Heavenly Ones to work, making it very\nclear that she had both the authority and the inclination to keep them busy.\nThis had driven off many of them, who preferred their sanctuaries in\nKholinar. Perhaps that had been the point. Leshwi instead did as she was\nasked. She floated up and over the railing, her long train slipping over and\nthen falling to drift in the open air beneath her. Another Heavenly One\nsoared upward past them, trailing cloth of gold and red.\n“Ancient One,” Venli said to Craving, stepping up to the railing. “What\nare we watching Raboniel for, if not to understand how she’s trying to gain\nadvantage over us? What is the purpose of my spying?”\n“We watch,” Leshwi said, floating down to eye level with Venli,\n“because we are frightened. To Raboniel, the games of men and singers are\npetty things—but so are their lives. We watch her, Venli, because we want a\nworld to remain when she is finished with her plots.”\nVenli felt a chill, attuning the Terrors. As Leshwi flew off, Venli took a\nlift, haunted by those words. The games of men and singers are petty\nthings … but so are their lives.…\nThe ominous words pulled Venli down from her earlier optimism. After\nstepping off the lift, she decided to stop and check on Rlain and the others.\nShe couldn’t help attuning Agony at the idea of those Regals in the\ninfirmary. At least the surgeon and his wife had the good sense to mostly\nstay out of sight.\nVenli slipped into the draped-off section of the room, where Hesina was\nkeeping watch today. She nodded as Venli entered, then grimaced and\nglanced toward the others inside. There was a new human here, one Venli\ndidn’t recognize, who stood with his eyes down, not speaking.\nA tension in the room was coming entirely from Lirin and Rlain, who\nfaced off at the rear, Rlain humming softly to Betrayal. What on Roshar?\n“I can’t believe I’m hearing this,” Rlain said. “I can’t believe it. He’s\nyour son.”\n“My son is long dead, bridgeman,” Lirin said, quickly packing a small\nbag full of surgical implements. “Kaladin kept trying to explain this, and I\nonly recently started understanding. He doesn’t want to be my son anymore."

Someone who recklessly endangered not just my\nfamily, but the lives of every human in the tower, while pursuing a vengeful\ngrudge.”\n“So you’re going to leave him to die?” Rlain demanded.\n“I didn’t say that,” Lirin snapped. “Do not put words in my mouth. I’ll\ngo as I would for anyone wounded.”\n“And afterward?” he demanded. “You said—”\n“I said we’d see,” Lirin said. “It’s possible I’ll need to bring him down\nhere to give him long-term care.”\n“You would give him up for execution!”\n“If that’s what is required, then so be it. I’ll do my job as a surgeon, then\nlet Kaladin deal with the consequences of his actions. I’m finished being a\npawn in games of death. For either side.”\nRlain threw up his hands. “What is the point of trying to save him if\nyou’re intending to have him killed!”\n“Quiet!” Venli hissed, glancing out the flimsy drapes toward the others in\nthe room outside. “What is going on here?”\nLirin glared at Rlain, who again hummed to Betrayal.\n“Our son survived the events of the other day,” Hesina said to Venli.\n“This is one of his friends. He says Kaladin’s powers aren’t working\nproperly, and his wounds aren’t healing. He’s in a coma and is slowly dying\nof what sounds like internal bleeding.”\n“That or an infection,” Lirin said, stuffing a few more things into his bag.\n“Can’t tell from the description.”\n“We’re not taking you to him,” Rlain said, “unless you promise not to\ngive him and Teft up to the enemy.” He looked to the other man in the\nroom, the newcomer, who nodded in agreement.\n“Then he’ll die for certain,” Lirin snapped. “Blood on your hands.”\nThe two glared at each other, and Venli attuned Irritation. As if she didn’t\nhave enough to worry about.\n“I’ll go,” Hesina said, walking over and taking the surgery bag off the\ntable.\n“Hesina—”\n“He’s my son too,” she said. “Let’s be on with this, Rlain. I can show\nyou how to treat the fever and give him some anti-inflammatories, along\nwith something to fight the infection.”\n“And if it is internal bleeding?” Lirin asked. “He will need surgery. You\ncan’t perform an operation like that in the field, Hesina.”\nHe sounded angry, but those were fearspren at his feet. Not angerspren.\nThe surgeon turned away and pretended to arrange his instruments. But\nhumans were so full of emotion, it spilled out of them. He couldn’t hide\nwhat he was feeling from Venli. Frustration. Worry.\nHe could say what he wanted. But he loved his son.\n“He needs to be brought here,” Lirin said, his voice laden with pain as"

If he’s in a coma, he will need long-term care. We\ncan put him in this room and pretend he’s unconscious like the others. It’s\nthe best way.”\n“He’d rather die,” the newcomer whispered. There was something odd\nabout his voice that Venli couldn’t place. He slurred his words.\nThe chamber fell silent. Save for one thing.\nTimbre vibrated with excitement inside Venli. The little spren was at it\nso loudly, Venli was certain the others would hear. How could they not?\n“It was going to catch up to Kal eventually,” Lirin said, his tone morose.\n“Most soldiers don’t die on the battlefield, you know. Far more die from\nwounds days later. My son taught you about triage, didn’t he? What did he\nsay about people with wounds like his?”\nThe two former bridgemen glanced at each other.\n“Make them comfortable,” the human with the slurred words said. “Give\nthem drink. Pain medication, if you can spare it. So they are peaceful when\nthey … when they die.”\nAgain the room grew quiet. All save for Timbre, practically bursting\nwith sound.\nIt’s time. It’s time. It’s time!\nWhen Venli spoke, she almost believed it was Timbre saying the words\nand not her.\n“What if,” she said, “I knew about an Edgedancer whose powers still\nseem to work? One who I think we can rescue?”\n* * *\nIt didn’t take much time to explain the plan. Venli had been thinking about\nthis for days now; she’d only needed some practice with her powers, and a\nlittle help from Rlain.\nThe Edgedancer was kept in the same cell Rlain had occupied not long\nago. Venli could get through that wall with ease; she was in control of her\npowers enough for that. The real trick would be pulling off the rescue\nwithout revealing or implicating herself.\nTimbre pulsed in annoyance as Venli and Rlain hurried toward the cell.\nThe human, Dabbid, was taking another route. Venli didn’t want to be seen\nwalking with him.\n“How did you get a Shardblade?” Rlain asked softly, to Curiosity. “And\nhow do they not know you have one?”\n“It’s a long story,” Venli said. Mostly because she hadn’t thought of a\nproper lie yet.\n“It’s Eshonai’s, isn’t it? Do you know what happened to her? I know you\nsaid she’s dead … but how?”\nShe died controlled by a Voidspren, Venli thought, because I tricked her\ninto inviting one into her gemheart. She fell into a chasm after fighting a\nhuman Shardbearer, then drowned. Alone. I found her corpse, and—under\nthe direction of a Voidspren—desecrated it by stealing her Shards.

I bonded\nit while traveling to Kholinar, before the Fused found me and the others.”\n“That was when they … they…” Rlain attuned the Rhythm of the Lost.\n“Yes,” Venli said to the same rhythm. “When they took the rest of our\nfriends. They left me because Odium wanted me to travel around, telling\nlies about our people to ‘inspire’ the newly awakened singers.”\n“I’m sorry,” Rlain said. “That must have been difficult for you, Venli.”\n“I survived,” Venli said. “But if we’re going to save this Radiant, we\nneed to be certain the Fused can’t trace this break-in to us. You can’t\nintervene, Rlain. The human has to manage the distraction himself.”\nRlain hummed to Consideration.\n“What?” Venli asked.\n“Dabbid isn’t the person I’d put in charge of something like this,” he\nsaid. “Until today, I thought he was completely mute.”\n“Is he trustworthy?”\n“Absolutely,” Rlain said. “He’s Bridge Four. But … well, I’d like to\nknow why he spent so long without talking. The bridge runs hit him hard, I\nknow, but there’s something else.” He hummed to Determination. “I won’t\nintervene unless something goes wrong.”\n“If you do, we all have to go into hiding,” Venli said to Skepticism. “So\nmake sure before you do anything.”\nHe nodded, still humming to Determination, and they split up at the next\nintersection. Venli found her way to a particular quiet section of hallway, lit\nonly by her held sphere. Most humans stayed away from this area; the\nPursuer’s troops were housed nearby. Raboniel’s occasional orders for\npeace to be maintained in the tower were barely enough to restrain those\nsoldiers.\nShe attuned Peace—sometimes used by listeners for measuring time.\nBeyond this wall was the cell. As the fourth movement of the rhythm\napproached, Venli pressed her hand against the stone and drew in Voidlight,\nrequisitioned just earlier to replace what she’d used. Storms, she hoped\nnews of her taking so much didn’t reach Raboniel.\nTimbre pulsed reassuringly. This stone, like the one earlier today,\nresponded to Venli’s touch. It shivered and rippled, as if it were getting a\ngood back-scratching.\nThe stone whispered to her. Move to the side. It guided her to the correct\nspot to breach the cell. Timbre’s rhythms pulsed through the rock, making it\nvibrate with the Rhythm of Hope. The fourth movement of Peace arrived—\nthe moment when Rlain would signal Dabbid to go in to the guards,\nbringing food for their lunch. Merely another servant doing his job. Nothing\nunusual, even if lunch came early today.\nTimbre exulted in the Rhythm of Hope as Venli pushed her hand into the\nstone. It felt good, warm and enveloping. Unlike what happened with the\nDeepest Ones, Venli displaced the rock. It became as crem in her fingers,\nsoft to the touch."

It became as crem in her fingers,\nsoft to the touch.\nShe wasn’t expert enough to get it to move on its own into the shapes\nshe wanted. It usually did what it wanted in those cases, such as forming the\ntiny statues on the floor above. So for now, she simply pushed her hand\nforward until it hit air on the other side. Then she pressed with her other\nhand and pulled the two apart, forming an opening straight through the\nstone—the normally hard rock curling and bunching up before her touch.\nA surprised set of human eyes appeared at the other end of the foot-long\nhole, looking through at her.\n“I’m going to get you out,” Venli whispered to the Rhythm of Pleading,\n“but you have to promise you won’t tell anyone what I’ve done. You won’t\ntell them about the powers I’m using. Not even other Radiants. They think\nI’m cutting you out with a Shardblade.”\n“What are you?” the human whispered in Alethi.\n“Promise me.”\n“Fine, promised. Done. Hurry. The guards are eating, and they didn’t\neven share none of it.”\nVenli continued shoving aside the stone. It took a ton of Light, and\nTimbre pulsed to Consolation—apparently she thought Venli’s efforts\ncrude, lacking finesse and skill.\nWell, it did the job. She managed to form a hole big enough for the\nhuman girl. When Venli let go of the stone, it hardened instantly—she had\nto shake a few chips of it free of her fingers. The girl poked it, then hopped\nthrough.\nHopefully the guards would assume a human Stoneward had survived\nand saved the girl. Venli gestured for the Edgedancer to follow her—but the\ngirl wavered. She seemed as if she was going to bolt away in another\ndirection.\n“Please,” Venli said. “We need you. To save a life. If you run now, he’ll\ndie.”\n“Who?”\n“Stormblessed,” Venli said. “Please, hurry with me.”\n“You’re one of them,” the girl said. “How’d you get Radiant powers?”\n“I … am not Radiant,” Venli said. “I have powers from the Fused that\nare like Radiant powers. I’m a friend of Rlain. The listener who was a\nbridgeman? Please. I wouldn’t free you only to put you in danger, but we\nneed to go, now!”\nThe girl cocked her head, then nodded for Venli to go first. The\nEdgedancer followed on silent feet, sticking to the shadows.\nEshonai used to walk like that, Venli thought. Quietly in the wilderness,\nto not disturb the wildlife. This girl didn’t have that same air about her\nthough.\nTimbre was pulsing contentedly to Hope. Venli couldn’t feel the same\nyet, not until she was certain Rlain and Dabbid hadn’t been caught. She led\nthe little Radiant girl to a room nearby to wait.\n“You’re a traitor to them, then?” the girl asked her.\n“I don’t know what I am,” Venli said. “Other than someone who didn’t"

The quiet bridgeman ran over and hugged the human girl, who\ngrinned.\n“Eh, moolie,” she said. “Strange friends ya got these days. You seen a\nchicken around here? Big red one? I lost ’im when I was running away.”\nDabbid shook his head, then knelt before the girl. “Healing. It works?”\n“Eh!” she said. “You can talk!”\nHe nodded.\n“Say ‘buttress,’” she told him. “It’s my favorite word.”\n“Healing?” he asked.\n“Yeah, I can still heal,” she said. “I think. I should be able to help him.”\nHe took her hand, insistent.\n“I’ll go with you,” Rlain said. He glanced at Venli and she hummed to\nSkepticism, indicating she wouldn’t go. She had to attend Raboniel.\n“I won’t stay away too long,” Rlain promised her. “I don’t want to draw\nsuspicion.” The other two left, but he lingered, then hummed to\nAppreciation. “I’m sorry about what I said when you first saw me in the\ncell. You’re not selfish, Venli.”\n“I am,” she said. “A lot of things are confusing to me these days—but of\nthat fact I’m certain.”\n“No,” he said. “Today you’re a hero. I know you’ve been through rough\ntimes, but today…” He grinned and hummed to Appreciation again, then\nducked out after the others.\nIf only he knew the whole story. Still, she felt upbeat as she headed\ntoward the scholar rooms below.\n“Can I say the words now?” she asked Timbre.\nThe pulse indicated the negative. Not yet.\n“When?” Venli asked.\nA simple, straightforward pulse was her answer.\nYou’ll know.\nMidius once told me … told me we could use Investiture … to enhance\nour minds, our memories, so we wouldn’t forget so much.\nRaboniel made good on her promise to leave Navani to her own designs.\nThe Fused studied the shield that protected the Sibling—but without Navani\nto accidentally act as a spy, Raboniel’s progress wasn’t nearly as rapid as\nbefore. Occasionally—when pacing so she could glance out past the guard\n—Navani would catch Raboniel sitting on the floor beside the blue shield,\nholding up the sphere full of Warlight and staring at it.\nNavani found herself in a curious situation. Forbidden to take part in the\nadministration of the tower, forbidden direct contact with her scholars, she\nhad only her research to occupy her. In a way, she had been given the gift\nshe’d always wished for: a chance to truly see if she could become a\nscholar.\nSomething had always prevented her from full dedication.

After\nGavilar’s death, she’d been too busy guiding Elhokar and then Aesudan.\nPerhaps Navani could have focused on scholarship when she’d first come to\nthe Shattered Plains—but there had been a Blackthorn to seduce and then a\nnew kingdom to forge. For all she complained about politics and the\ndistractions of administering a kingdom, she certainly did find her way into\nthe middle of both with frightful regularity.\nPerhaps Navani should go do menial labor. At least that way she’d be\namong the people. And wouldn’t risk doing any more damage. Except …\nRaboniel would certainly never let her go around unsupervised. Plus, the\nlure of unknown secrets called to Navani. She had information Raboniel did\nnot. Navani had seen a sphere that warped air, filled with what seemed to be\nsome kind of anti-Voidlight. She knew about the explosion.\nThe thing Raboniel wanted to create was possible. So … why not try to\nfind out how to make it? Why not see what she could actually do? The\npower to destroy a god. Negative Light. Can I crack the secret?\nWhat if Navani was thinking too small in trying to save the tower? What\nif there was a way to end the war once and for all? What if Navani really\ncould find a way to destroy Odium?\nShe needed to try. But how to even start? Well … the best way to\nencourage discoveries from her scholars was usually to cultivate the proper\nenvironment and attitude. Keep them studying, keep them experimenting.\nOftentimes the greatest discoveries came not because a woman was looking\nfor them, but because she was so engrossed in some other topic that she\nstarted making connections she never would have otherwise.\nSo, over the next few days, Navani tried to replicate this state in herself.\nShe ordered parts, supplies, fabrial mechanisms—some all the way from\nKholinar—and they were delivered without a word of complaint. That\nincluded, most importantly, many gemstones bearing corrupted spren to\npower fabrials.\nTo warm up, she spent time creating weapons that wouldn’t look like\nweapons. Traps she could use, if she grew truly desperate, to defend her\nroom or the pillar room. She wasn’t certain how she would deploy them—\nor if she would need to. For now, it was something scholarly to do,\nsomething familiar, and she threw herself wholeheartedly into the work.\nShe hid painrials inside other fabrials, constructed to appear innocuous.\nShe made alarms to distract, using technology they’d discovered from the\ngemstones left by the old Radiants in Urithiru. She used conjoined rubies to\nmake spring traps that would release spikes.\nShe put Voidlight spheres in her fabrial traps, then set them to be armed\nby a simple trick. A magnet against the side of the cube, in precisely the\nright place, would move a metal lever and arm the traps. This way they\nwouldn’t activate until she needed them. She had these boxes stored out in\nthe hallway, as if they were half-completed experiments she intended to\nreturn to in a few days.

The space was already lined with boxes from the\nother scholars, so Navani’s additions didn’t feel out of place.\nAfterward, she had Raboniel help her make more Warlight for\nexperiments. Navani couldn’t create it by herself, unfortunately. No\ncombination of tuning forks or instruments replicated Raboniel’s presence\n—but so far as Navani could tell, the Fused also couldn’t create it without a\nhuman’s help.\nNavani got better at humming the tone, mastering the rhythm. In those\nmoments, she felt as if she could hear the very soul of Roshar speaking to\nher. She’d never been particularly interested in music, but—like her\ngrowing obsession with Light—she found it increasingly fascinating.\nWaves, sounds, and what they meant for science.\nUnderlying all the work she did was a singular question: How would one\nmake the opposite of Voidlight? What had been in that sphere of Gavilar’s?\nIn Vorinism, pure things were said to be symmetrical. And all things had\nan opposite. It was easy to see why Raboniel had assumed the dark Light of\nthe Void would be the opposite of Stormlight, but darkness wasn’t truly an\nopposite of light. It was simply the absence of light.\nShe needed some way to measure Investiture, the power in a gemstone.\nAnd she needed some kind of model, a form of energy that she knew had an\nopposite. What things in nature had a provable, measurable opposite?\n“Magnets,” she said, pushing aside her chair and standing up from her\nnotes. She walked up to the guard at her chamber door. “I need more\nmagnets. Stronger ones this time. We kept some in the chemical supplies\nstorehouse on the second floor.”\nThe guard hummed a tone, and accompanied it with a long-suffering\nsigh for Navani’s benefit. He glanced around for support, but the only other\nsinger nearby was Raboniel’s daughter, who sat outside the room with her\nback to the wall, holding a sword across her lap and staring off into the\ndistance while humming. It wasn’t a rhythm, Navani realized, but a tune she\nrecognized—a human one sung sometimes at taverns. How did the Fused\nknow it?\n“I suppose I can see it done,” the guard said to Navani. “Though some of\nour people are growing annoyed by your persistent demands.”\n“Take it up with Raboniel,” Navani said, walking to her seat. “Oh, and\nthe Fused use some kind of weapon that draws Stormlight out of Radiants\nthey stab. Get me some of that metal.”\n“I’ll need the Lady of Wishes to approve that,” the guard said.\n“Then ask her. Go on. I’m not going to run off. Where do you think I’d\ngo?”\nThe guard—a stormform Regal—grumbled and moved off to do as she\nasked. Navani had teased out a few things about him during her\nincarceration. He’d been a parshman slave in the palace at Kholinar. He\nthought she should recognize him, and … well, perhaps she should.\nParshmen had always been so invisible though.\nShe tried a different experiment while she waited.

That meant a split gemstone—and a split\nspren, divided right through the center. She was trying to see if she could\nuse the tuning fork method to draw out the halves of the spren and rejoin\nthem in a larger ruby. She thought that might please the Sibling, who still\nwouldn’t talk to her.\nShe put a magnifying lens on one half of the gemstone and watched as\nthe spren within reacted to the tuning fork. This was a corrupted\nflamespren; that shouldn’t change the nature of the experiment, or so she\nhoped.\nIt was moving in there, trying to reach the sound. It pressed against the\nwall of the gemstone, but couldn’t escape. Stormlight can leak through\nmicro-holes in the structure, Navani thought. But the spren is too large.\nA short time later, someone stepped up to the doorway; Navani noticed\nthe darkening light of someone moving in front of the lamp. “My\nmagnets?” Navani asked, holding out her hand while still peering at the\nspren. “Bring them here.”\n“Not the magnets,” Raboniel said.\n“Lady of Wishes,” Navani said, turning and bowing from her seat. “I\napologize for not recognizing you.”\nRaboniel hummed a rhythm Navani couldn’t distinguish, then walked\nover to inspect the experiment.\n“I’m trying to rejoin a split spren,” Navani explained. “Past experience\nshows that breaking a gemstone in half lets the flamespren go—but in that\ncase, the two halves grow into separate flamespren. I’m trying to see if I can\nmerge them back together.”\nRaboniel placed something on the desk—a small dagger, ornate, with an\nintricately carved wooden handle and a large ruby set at the base. Navani\npicked it up, noting that the center of the blade—running like a vein from\ntip to hilt—was a different kind of metal than the rest.\n“We use these for collecting the souls of Heralds,” Raboniel noted. “Or\nthat was the plan. We’ve taken a single one so far, and … there have been\ncomplications with that capture. I had hoped to harvest the two you\nreportedly had here, but they left with your expeditionary force.”\nNavani flipped the weapon over, feeling cold.\n“We’ve used this metal for several Returns to drain Stormlight from\nRadiants,” Raboniel said. “It conducts Investiture, drawing it from a source\nand pulling it inward. We used it to fill gemstones, but didn’t realize until\nthe fall of Ba-Ado-Mishram that capturing spren in gemstones was possible.\nIt was then that one of us—She Who Dreams—realized it might be possible\nto trap a Herald’s soul in the same way.”\nNavani licked her lips. So it was true. Shalash had told them\nJezerezeh’Elin had fallen. They hadn’t realized how. This was better than\nabsolute destruction though. Could he be recovered this way?\n“What will you do with their souls?” Navani asked. “Once you have\nthem?”"

Why did\nyou want this metal? The guard told me you’d asked after it.”\n“I thought,” Navani said, “this might be a better way to conduct\nStormlight and Voidlight—to transfer it out of gemstones.”\n“It would work,” Raboniel said. “But it isn’t terribly practical. Raysium\nis exceptionally difficult to obtain.” She nodded to the dagger she’d given\nNavani. “That specific weapon, you should know, contains only a small\namount of the metal—not enough to harvest a Herald’s soul. It would not,\ntherefore, be of any danger to me—should you consider trying such an act.”\n“Understood, Ancient One,” Navani said. “I want it only for my\nexperiments. Thank you.” She touched the tip of the dagger—with the\nwhite-gold metal—to one half of the divided ruby. Nothing happened.\n“Generally, you need to stab someone with it for it to work,” Raboniel\nsaid. “You need to touch the soul.”\nNavani nodded absently, resetting her equipment with the tuning fork\nand the magnifying lens, then watching the spren inside move to the sound.\nShe set the tip of the dagger against it again, watching for any different\nbehavior.\n“You seem to be enjoying yourself,” Raboniel noted.\n“I would enjoy myself more if my people were free, Lady of Wishes,”\nNavani said. “But I intend to use this time to some advantage.”\nTheir defense of the tower, frail though it was, had utterly collapsed. She\ncouldn’t reach Kaladin, hear the Sibling, or plan with her scholars. There\nwas only one node left to protect the heart of the tower from corruption.\nNavani had a solitary hope remaining: that she could imitate a scholar\nwell enough to build a new weapon. A weapon to kill a god.\nIn her experiment, nothing happened. The spren couldn’t get out of the\nruby, even with the tone calling it. The spren was vivid blue, as it was\ncorrupted, and appeared as half a spren: one arm, one leg. Why continue to\nmanifest that way? Flamespren often changed forms—and they were\ninfamous for noticing they were being watched. Navani had read some very\ninteresting essays on the topic.\nShe picked up a small jeweler’s hammer. Carefully, she cracked the half\nruby, letting the spren escape. It sprang free, but was immediately captured\nby the dagger. Light traveled along the blade, then the ruby at the base\nbegan to glow. Navani confirmed that the half spren was inside.\nInteresting, Navani thought. So, what if I break the other half of the ruby\nand capture that half in the same gemstone? Excited, she reached to grab\nthe other half of the ruby—but when she moved it, the dagger skidded\nacross the table.\nNavani froze. The two halves of the spren were still conjoined?

The other half of the ruby flew out several feet toward\nthe center of the room.\nToo far. Much too far. She’d moved the dagger half a foot, while the\npaired ruby had moved three times as far. Navani stared at the hovering\nruby, her eyes wide.\nRaboniel hummed a loud rhythm, looking just as startled. “How?” she\nasked. “Is it because the spren is corrupted?”\n“Possibly,” Navani said. “Though I’ve been experimenting with\nconjoined spren, and corrupted ones seem to generally behave the same as\nuncorrupted ones.” She eyed the dagger. “The gemstone on the dagger is\nlarger than the one it was in before. Always before, you had to split a\ngemstone in two equal halves to conjoin them. Perhaps by moving one half\nto a larger gemstone, I have created something new.…”\n“Force multiplication?” Raboniel asked. “Move a large gemstone a short\ndistance, and cause the small gemstone to go a very long one?”\n“Energy will be conserved, if our understanding of fabrial laws is\ncorrect,” Navani said. “Greater Light will be required, and moving the\nlarger gemstone will be more difficult in equivalency to the work done by\nthe smaller gemstone. But storms … the implications…”\n“Write this down,” Raboniel said. “Record your observations. I will do\nthe same.”\n“Why?” Navani asked.\n“The Rhythm of War, Navani,” Raboniel said as an explanation—though\nit didn’t seem one to Navani. “Do it. And continue your experiments.”\n“I will,” she said. “But Lady of Wishes, I’m running into another\nproblem. I need a way to measure the strength of Stormlight in a\ngemstone.”\nRaboniel didn’t press for details. “There is sand that does this,” she said.\n“Sand?”\n“It is black naturally, but turns white in the presence of Stormlight. It\ncan, therefore, be used to measure the strength of Investiture—the more\npowerful the source of power nearby, the quicker the sand changes. I will\nget some for you.” She hummed loudly. “This is amazing, Navani. I don’t\nthink I’ve known a scholar so capable, not in many Returns.”\n“I’m not a…” Navani trailed off. “Thank you,” she said instead.\nWhy would I want to remember?\nDabbid had been different all his life.\nThat was the word his mother had used. “Different.” He liked that word.\nIt didn’t try to pretend. Something was different about him. He had been six\nwhen he started talking. He still couldn’t do adding in his head. He could\nfollow instructions, but he forgot steps if they were too long.\nHe was different.\nThe surgeons hadn’t been able to say the reason. They said some people\nare just different. He was always going to be like this. The midwife, when\nshe heard about him later, said the cord was wrapped around his neck when\nhe was born. Maybe that was why.\nWhen he’d been young, Dabbid had tried putting a rope around his neck"

He hadn’t tried to die. He’d just tightened it a little, so he\ncould know what baby Dabbid had felt.\nWhen someone saw, everyone had panicked. They called him stupid.\nThey took ropes away from him for years. They thought he was too dumb\nto know it would hurt him. He often got into trouble like that. Doing things\nothers wouldn’t do. Not understanding it would make people panic. He had\nto be very careful not to make regular people frightened. They liked to be\nscared of him. He did not know why. He was different. But not scary\ndifferent.\nIt had gotten worse when his mother died. People had become meaner on\nthat day. It wasn’t his fault. He hadn’t even been there. But suddenly,\neveryone was meaner. He ended up at war, serving a lighteyes. Washing his\nclothing.\nWhen a darkeyed baby was born to the man’s wife, everyone had gotten\nangry at Dabbid. He’d explained that they were wrong. Everybody was\nwrong sometimes.\nIt hadn’t been until much later that he’d realized the brightlady had lied.\nTo punish someone other than her secret lover. He could understand things,\nif he had time to think about them. Sometimes.\nHe’d ended up running bridges. Dabbid didn’t remember much from that\ntime. He’d lost track of the days. He’d barely spoken back then. He had\nbeen confused. He had been frightened. He had been angry. But he didn’t\nlet people know he was angry. People got scared and hurt him when he was\nangry.\nHe’d done his job, terrified more each day, certain he would die. In fact,\nhe’d figured he must already be dead. So when a horse—from one of\nSadeas’s own soldiers—had all but trampled him, shoving him and hurling\nhim to the ground, his arm broken, he’d curled up and waited to die.\nThen … Kaladin. Kaladin Stormblessed. He hadn’t cared that Dabbid\nwas different. He hadn’t cared that Dabbid had given up. Kaladin hauled\nhim out of Damnation and gave him another family.\nDabbid couldn’t quite recall when he’d started to come out of his battle\nshock. He hadn’t ever really lost it. Who could? People clapping sounded\nlike bowstrings snapping. Footfalls sounded like hooves. Or he’d hear\nsinging, like the Parshendi, and he was there again. Dying.\nStill, he had started to feel better. Somewhere along the way, he’d started\nto feel like his old self. Except he’d had a new family. He’d had friends.\nAnd none of them had known he was different.\nWell, they thought he was another kind of different. They thought he had\nbeen hurt by the battle, like all of them. He was one of them. They hadn’t\nknown about his mind. How he’d been born.\nHe didn’t like it when people used the word “stupid” for the way he was."

But that made him different, not stupid.\nStupid was a choice.\nIn the past, his speech had told people he was different. He’d figured that\nout when he was moving from job to job after his mother died. When he’d\nspoken, they’d known. So … with Bridge Four … he’d just kept on not\nspeaking.\nThat way they wouldn’t know. That way they wouldn’t realize he was\nDabbid different. He could just be Bridge Four different.\nThen everyone had started getting spren. Except him. And then the tower\nhad started talking to him. And … he still wasn’t certain if he’d done\nsomething stupid or not. But going to Rlain, that hadn’t been stupid. He was\ncertain of it.\nSo today, he tried not to think about his mistakes. He tried not to think\nabout how if he’d been stronger, he could have helped Kaladin fight. He\ntried not to think about how he’d lied to the others by pretending he\ncouldn’t speak. He tried to focus on what he could do to help.\nHe led Rlain up through the tunnels. They met singers a couple of times.\nRlain talked, his voice calm with rhythms, and the singers let them go. They\nwent up and up, and Dabbid showed him a hidden stairwell. They snuck\npast the guard patrols on the sixth floor.\nUp and up. Dabbid’s heart thumped. Worrying. Would Lift meet them,\nlike she’d promised? Lift knew the tower better than they did. She said she\ncould make it on her own. But would she run away?\nWhen they reached the meeting place on the tenth floor, they found her\nwaiting. She sat on the ground, eating some curry and bread.\n“Where did you get that?” Rlain asked.\n“Fused,” she said, gesturing. “Funny. They need to eat. Suppose that\nmeans they poop, right?”\n“I suppose,” Rlain said, sounding disapproving.\n“Ain’t that a kick in the bits?” Lift asked. “You get made immortal; you\ncan live through the centuries. You can fly, or walk through rock, or\nsomething like that. But you still gotta piss like everyone else.”\n“I don’t see the point of this conversation,” Rlain said. “Hurry. We need\nto get to Kaladin.”\nLift rolled her eyes in an exaggerated way, then stood up and handed\nDabbid some flatbread. He nodded in thanks and tucked it away for later.\n“When didya start talkin’?” Lift asked him.\n“I was six,” he said. “Mom said.”\n“No, I mean…” She gestured at him.\nDabbid felt himself blush, and he looked at his feet. “I could for a long\ntime. Just didn’t.”\n“Didn’t want to talk? I’ve never felt like that. Except this once, when I\nate the queen’s dinner, but it had been sitting out, see, and she didn’t put it"

It’s her fault, I told her, because it’s like leavin’\na sword out where a baby could step on it and cut up her foot or somethin’.”\n“Can we please keep moving?” Rlain demanded.\nDabbid led them the rest of the way. He felt more anxious now. Was he\ntoo late? Had Kaladin died while he was gone? Was he too slow to help?\nToo different to have realized earlier what he should have done?\nDabbid led them to the place on the eleventh floor, but the door had\nstopped working. It had been too long since Kaladin infused it. They had\nLift though, and when she pressed her hand to the gemstone, the door\nopened.\nIt smelled of sweat and blood in there. Dabbid hurried past the place\nwhere Teft lay unconscious, reaching Kaladin. On the floor, wrapped in\nblankets. Thrashing. Still alive.\nStill alive.\n“Storms,” Lift said, stepping over. Kaladin’s face was coated in sweat.\nHis teeth were gritted, his eyes squeezed shut. He flailed in his blankets,\ngrowling softly. Dabbid had cut off his shirt to look for wounds. While there\nwere scabs all along Kaladin’s side, the worst part was the infection. It\nspread across the skin from the cut. A violent redness. Hateful, covered in\nlittle rotspren.\nLift stepped back, wrapping her arms around herself. “Storms.”\n“I’ve … never seen a fever like that,” Rlain said, towering over the two\nof them. Did he know how large he was in warform? “Have you?”\nLift shook her head.\n“Please,” Dabbid said. “Please help.”\nLift held out her hand, palm forward, and burst alight with power.\nStormlight rose from her skin like white smoke, and she knelt. She shied\naway as Kaladin thrashed again, then she lunged forward and pressed her\nhand to his chest.\nThe redness immediately retreated, and the rotspren fled, as if they\ncouldn’t stand the presence of her touch. Kaladin’s back arched. He was\nhurting!\nThen he collapsed into the blankets. Lift pressed her other hand against\nhis side, and the wound continued to heal, the redness fleeing. She furrowed\nher brow and bit her lip. Dabbid did the same. Maybe it would help.\nShe pushed so much Stormlight into Kaladin he started glowing himself.\nWhen she sat back, the scabs flaked off his side, leaving smooth new skin.\n“That … was hard,” she whispered. “Even harder than when I saved\nGawx.” She wiped her brow. “I’m sweating.”\n“Thank you,” Dabbid said, taking her hand.\n“Ew,” she said. Oh. It was the hand she’d just used to wipe her head.\n“Thank you,” he said.\nShe shrugged. “My awesomeness—the slippery part—doesn’t work\nanymore. But this does. Wonder why.”"

Dabbid tried to make Kaladin comfortable,\nbunching up a blanket to make a pillow. His friend was still unconscious,\nbut sleeping peacefully now.\n“I have a lot of questions, Dabbid,” Rlain said. “First off, why have you\nbeen keeping quiet when you could speak?”\n“I…”\n“He don’t gotta say nothin’ if he don’t wanna,” Lift said. She’d found\ntheir rations already, and was eating. Wow.\n“He’s Bridge Four,” Rlain said. “We’re family. Family doesn’t lie to one\nanother.”\n“I’m sorry,” Dabbid said softly. “I just … didn’t want you to know\nI’m … different.”\n“We’re all different,” Rlain said, folding his arms. Storms, he was so\nfrightening in carapace armor.\n“I’m more different,” Dabbid said. “I … I was born different.”\n“You mean born … you know … an idiot?” Rlain said.\nDabbid winced. He hated that word, though Rlain didn’t use it hatefully.\nIt was just a word to him.\n“Touched,” Lift said. “I’ve known lotsa kids like him on the street. They\ndon’t think the same way as everyone else. It happens.”\n“It happens,” Dabbid agreed. “It happened to me. But you didn’t know.\nSo you couldn’t treat me like I was … wrong. You know about being extra\ndifferent, right Rlain?”\n“I guess I do,” he said. “You shouldn’t feel that you have to hide what\nyou are though.”\n“I will be fixed,” Dabbid said, “when I get a spren. Becoming Radiant\nwill heal me, because my brain isn’t supposed to be like this. I was hurt\nafter I was born. The tower said so.”\n“The tower?” Rlain asked.\n“The tower can talk,” Lift said. “It’s a spren.”\n“And it promised to heal you, Dabbid?”\nHe nodded. Though it hadn’t said that in so many words. He wondered\nnow if it had been lying.\nThe queen hadn’t been pleased by how he’d snuck around, doing tasks\nfor the Sibling. Maybe he should be more suspicious. Even of spren.\nBut someday … when he was Radiant …\nRlain dug out a new set of blankets for Kaladin from the pile. Dabbid\nhad washed those earlier, as he’d wanted something to do. They got Kaladin\nuntangled from the sweaty ones, then wrapped him in—\n“What in storming Damnation are you fools doing?” a gruff voice said\nfrom behind them.\nDabbid froze. Then turned around slowly. Lift was perched on the end of\nTeft’s shelf, absently munching on a ration bar—Soulcast grain, cooked and\npressed. She was pulling her hand back from Teft’s exposed foot,\nStormlight curling off her body.\nTeft, in turn, was pushing himself up to sit.\nTeft was awake.\nDabbid let out a whoop and leaped up.

You’re awake. It worked.”\nDabbid stepped back as Teft said something, causing Kaladin to sit up—\nthen laugh in joy. It had worked.\nDabbid wasn’t Radiant. He wasn’t brave. He wasn’t smart.

She’d been technically a youth then, though fully grown.\nNow she was an adult. She saw as an adult did.\nShe turned and cut through a side street of the ancient city, passing large\ncrem-covered walls like tall ridges of natural stone. You’d have to cut deep\nwith a Shardblade to find the worked stone at the heart.\nThis was the more direct way, so she was waiting as Denshil walked past\nwith the gemstone. He was scrawny even when wearing workform, and had\na pattern of black and red skin that looked like true marblework, all rough\nand coarse. He jumped as he saw Venli.\n“What are you doing,” he hissed to Anxiety as she walked along beside\nhim.\n“Acting naturally,” she said. “I’m head of our scholars. It’s normal for\nme to visit our farmers and see how their work is progressing.”\nHe still acted nervous, but at least he attuned Peace as they walked. It\ndidn’t matter. They passed few listeners on the streets. All who weren’t\nabsolutely needed as farmers, caretakers, or other essential workers had\njoined Eshonai.\nIn a perfect bit of poetry, this ensured that the bravest of the listeners—\nthose most likely to resist Venli when she brought them stormform—fought\non the front lines each day, dying. Each corpse brought Venli one step\ncloser to her goal.\nShe’d stopped pretending this was only about protecting her people. As\nshe’d grown into herself and become more confident, she’d decided what\nshe truly wanted. True freedom—with the power to make certain she’d\nnever have to be dependent upon anyone else, listener or spren. True\nfreedom couldn’t exist while someone else had power over you.\nSo yes, her work was about helping her people, in part. But deep within\nher—where the rhythms began—Venli promised herself that she would be\nthe one who obtained the most freedom.\n“How goes your work?” Venli asked to Confidence.\nDenshil’s rhythm slipped to Anxiety again. Foolish farmer. He’d better\nnot give them away.\n“The others believe me,” he said softly, “and they should. I’m not saying\nanything that’s a lie, really. If we cut these gemhearts like the humans do,\nthey hold more Stormlight. But I don’t mention the extra bits I cut off\nbefore delivering the faceted stone to the fields.…”\n“How much have you saved?”\n“Several hundred gemstones.”\n“I need more,” Venli said.\nHe blatantly attuned Irritation. “More? What crazy rhythm are you\nlistening to?”\n“We need one for every listener in the city.”\n“I can’t,” he said. “If you—”\n“You can,” Venli said to Reprimand. “And you will. Cut the gemstones\nsmaller. Give less to the fields.”\n“And if we end up starving because of it? Gemstones break, you know,\nwhen you sing to them. We will run out.”\n“We won’t live long enough to starve, Denshil. Not if the humans get\nhere. Not if they find your children and take away their songs…”"

Not if they find your children and take away their songs…”\nThe malen attuned Longing immediately. The listeners had few children\nthese days. Most had stopped taking mateform years ago, and they had\nnever been as fecund a people as the humans apparently were.\n“Think how you could improve,” Venli said. “For them, Denshil. For\nyour daughter.”\n“We should bring this to the Five,” he said.\n“We will. You can watch me bring the proposal to them. This will be\ndone properly—you and I are simply preparing the way.”\nHe nodded, and Venli let him rush on ahead to the ancient building\nwhere he practiced gem cutting—an art Ulim had taught him.\nSay a name on the breeze and it will return, she thought, noting a red\nlight glowing from within an old abandoned building. They’d had to cut the\nwindow out to get to the structure inside. She strolled over, and Ulim\nstepped out onto the windowsill—invisible to everyone but those he chose.\n“You’ve learned to lie very well,” he said to Subservience.\n“I have,” she said. “Are we ready?”\n“Close,” he said. “I feel the storm on the other side. I think it’s nearly\nhere.”\n“You think?” Venli demanded.\n“I can’t see into Shadesmar,” he snapped to Derision.\nShe didn’t quite understand his explanations of what was happening. But\nshe knew a storm was mounting in Shadesmar. In fact, the storm had been\nbuilding for generations—growing in fury, intensity. It barred the way to\nDamnation.\nThat storm was where Ulim had originally come from. There were also\nthousands of another kind of spren in the storm: stormspren. Mindless\nthings like windspren or flamespren.\nVenli had to find a way to pull those stormspren across and capture them.\nTo that end, a large portion of the roiling storm had been broken off by the\ngod of gods, the ancient one called Odium. This storm was his strength, his\nessence. Over painful months, he’d moved the storm across the landscape—\nunseen—until it arrived here. Kind of. Almost.\n“What will happen,” Venli asked to Curiosity, “when my storm comes to\nthis world?”\n“Your storm?”\n“I am the one who summons it, spren,” she said. “It is mine.”\n“Sure, sure,” he said. A little too quickly, and with too many hand\ngestures. He had grown obsequious over the last few years—and liked to\npretend that his betrayal of her in the Kholinar palace had never happened.\n“When this storm comes, you will serve me,” Venli said.\n“I serve you now.”\n“Barely. Promise it. You’ll serve me.”\n“I will serve,” he said. “I promise it, Venli. But we have to bring the\nstormspren to this side first. And persuade the listeners to take the forms.”\n“The second will not be a problem.”\n“You’re too certain about that,” he said. “Remember, they killed the\nAlethi king to prevent this from happening. Traitors.”"

Right outside her\nreach.\n“Focus less on that,” Venli said. “And more on your duties.”\n“Yes, Venli,” he said, voice cooing as he spoke to Subservience. “You’re\ngoing to be amazed by the power you get from stormform. And the massive\nstorm you’ll bring through? It will be unlike anything the world has ever\nseen. Odium’s raw power, blowing across the world in the wrong direction.\nIt will devastate the humans, leave them broken and easily conquered. Ripe\nfor your domination, Venli.”\n“Enough,” she said. “Don’t sell it so hard, Ulim. I’m not the child you\nfound when you first arrived here. Do your job, and get the storm into\nposition. I’ll capture the stormspren.”\n“How, though?”\nHow. “They are the spren of storms, right?”\n“Well, a storm,” Ulim said. “In the past, they mostly spent their time\ninside gemhearts. Odium would directly bless the singer, making them a\nkind of royalty. They didn’t really wander about much.”\nRoyalty? She liked the sound of that. She smiled, imagining how\nEshonai would act toward her then.\n“My scholars are confident,” Venli said. “From what you’ve told them,\nand the experiments we’ve done with other kinds of spren, we think if we\ncan gather a small collection of stormspren in gemstones, others will get\npulled through more easily.”\n“But we need that initial seed!” Ulim said. “How?”\nShe nodded to the sky, where her imaginings had brought forth a\ngloryspren. An enormous brilliant sphere, with wings along the sides.\n“Those pop in when we think the proper thoughts. Feel the right things. So,\nwhat brings stormspren?”\n“A storm…” Ulim said. “It might work. Worth trying.”\nThey’d have to experiment. Even with his help, it had taken several tries\nto figure out nimbleform—and that was a relatively easy form. Still, she\nwas pleased with their progress. Yes, it had taken far, far longer than she’d\nanticipated. But over those many years, she’d become the person she was\nnow. Confident, like her younger self had never been.\nShe turned to make her way toward where her scholars studied the\nsongs, written in the script she’d devised.

Eshonai would\nfollow her if she hurried on, so she slowed and turned.\nVenli’s sister looked so strange in Shardplate. It … well, it fit her. It\nsupernaturally molded to her form, making space for her carapace, shaping\nitself to her figure, but it was more than that. To Venli, some of the\nwarforms seemed like they were playing pretend—their faces didn’t match\ntheir new shape. Not Eshonai. Eshonai looked like a soldier, with a wider\nneck, powerful jaw and head, and enormous hands.\nVenli regretted encouraging Eshonai to visit the former Shardbearer. She\nhadn’t expected that years later, she’d feel dwarfed by her sister. Though\nmuch about Venli’s life was enviable now—she had position, friends, and\nresponsibility—there was a part of her that wished she’d been able to obtain\nthis without Eshonai also gaining high station.\n“What?” Venli asked to Irritation. “I have work to do today, Eshonai, and\n—”\n“It’s Mother,” Eshonai said.\nVenli immediately attuned the Terrors. “What about her? What’s\nwrong?”\nEshonai attuned Resolve and led Venli quietly to their mother’s home on\nthe outskirts of town. A small structure, but solitary, with plenty of room for\ngardening projects.\nTheir mother wasn’t in the garden, working on her shalebark. She was\ninside lying on a hard cot, her head wrapped in a bandage. One of Venli’s\nscholars—Mikaim, who was their surgeon—stepped away from the cot.\n“It’s not bad,” she said. “Head wounds can be frightful, but it was little\nmore than a scrape. The bigger worry is how afraid she was. I gave her\nsomething to help her sleep.”\nVenli hummed to Appreciation and Mikaim withdrew. Eshonai stood\nopposite Venli over the cot, her helmet under her arm, and for a time the\ntwo of them hummed together to the Lost. A rare moment when they both\nheard the same rhythm.\n“Do you know what happened?” Venli finally asked.\n“She was found wandering one of the outer plateaus. Frightened, acting\nlike a little child. She didn’t respond to her own name at first, though by the\ntime she got here she had recovered enough to begin answering questions\nabout her childhood. She didn’t remember how she hurt herself.”\nVenli breathed deeply, and listened to the haunting Rhythm of the Lost, a\nviolent beat with staccato notes.\n“We might need to confine her to her house,” Eshonai said.\n“No!” Venli said. “Never. We can’t do that to her, Eshonai.\nImprisonment on top of her ailment?”\nEshonai attuned Reconciliation, settling down on the floor, her\nShardplate scraping softly. “You’re right, of course. She must be allowed to\nsee the sky, look to the horizon. We can get her a servant perhaps. Someone\nto keep watch over her.”"

Someone\nto keep watch over her.”\n“An acceptable accommodation,” Venli said, lingering beside the cot.\nShe really should check on her scholars.\nEshonai leaned—gingerly, because her Plate was so heavy—against the\nwall. She closed her eyes, humming to Peace. It was forced, a little loud.\nShe was trying to override other rhythms.\nShe looks more like herself sitting like that, Venli thought idly,\nremembering Eshonai as a child. The sister who would pick Venli up when\nshe scraped her knee, or who would chase cremlings with her. Eshonai had\nalways seemed so vibrant—so alive. As if she’d been trying to burst out, her\nsoul straining against the confines of a flawed body.\n“You always led me toward the horizon,” Venli found herself saying.\n“Even as children. Always running to the next hill to see what was on the\nother side…”\n“Would that we could return,” Eshonai said to the Lost.\n“To those ignorant days?”\n“To that joy. That innocence.”\n“Innocence is more false a god than the ones in our songs,” Venli said,\nsitting beside her sister. “People who chase it will find themselves\nenslaved.”\nVenli felt tired, she realized. She’d been spending far too many nights\nthinking of plans. And it would only get worse, as she needed to start going\nout into storms to trap stormspren.\n“I’m sorry I brought us to this,” Eshonai whispered to Reconciliation.\n“We’ve lost so many. How far will it go? All because I made a snap\ndecision in a moment of tension.”\n“That sphere,” Venli said. “The one King Gavilar gave you…” They’d\nall seen it, though it had faded several months later.\n“Yes. A dark power. And he claimed to be seeking to return our gods.”\nUlim had been nervous about Gavilar’s sphere. The little spren said\nGavilar hadn’t been working with him, or any of Odium’s agents—indeed,\nhe’d been hostile to them. So Ulim had no idea how he’d obtained Odium’s\nLight.\n“Maybe,” Venli said, “if the humans are seeking to contact our gods,\nperhaps we should explore the option too. Perhaps the things from our\nsongs are—”\n“Stop,” Eshonai said to Reprimand. “Venli, what are you saying? You\nbetter than most should know the foolishness of what you say.”\nI’m always a fool to you, aren’t I? Venli attuned Irritation. Unfortunately,\nthis was the Eshonai she’d come to know. Not the child who encouraged\nher. The adult who held her back, ridiculed her.\n“Sing the song with me,” Eshonai said. “‘Terrible and great they were,\nbut—’”\n“Please don’t turn this into another lecture, Eshonai,” Venli said. “Just …\nstop, all right?”\nEshonai trailed off, then hummed to Reconciliation. The two of them sat\nfor a time, the light outside dimming as the sun drifted toward the horizon."

The two of them sat\nfor a time, the light outside dimming as the sun drifted toward the horizon.\nVenli found herself humming to Reconciliation as well. She explored the\nrhythm, finding a complementary tone to Eshonai’s, seeking again—for a\nbrief moment—to be in tune with her sister.\nEshonai quietly changed to Longing, and Venli followed. And then,\ncautiously, Venli switched to Joy. Eshonai followed her this time. Together\nthey made a song, and Venli began singing. It had been … well, years since\nshe’d practiced the songs. She’d long ago stopped thinking of herself as the\napprentice song keeper; they had plenty of others to uphold their traditions,\nnow that they’d united the families.\nShe still remembered the songs though. This was the Song of Mornings.\nA teaching song, meant to train a young child for more complex rhythms\nand songs. There was something satisfying about a simple song you could\nsing well. You could add your own complexity. And you could sing the\nsong’s soul—rather than struggle with missed lyrics or failed notes.\nShe let her voice drift off at the end, and Eshonai’s humming quieted.\nDusk fell outside. The perfectly wrong time for the Song of Mornings. She\nloved that it had worked so well anyway.\n“Thank you, Venli,” Eshonai said. “For all that you do. You don’t get\nenough credit for having brought us these forms. Without warform, we\nwouldn’t stand a chance of resisting the humans. We’d probably be their\nslaves.”\n“I…” Venli tried to attune Confidence, but it slipped away from her. “As\nlong as you and Demid know what I did, I suppose it doesn’t sting so much\nwhen others pass me over.”\n“Do you think you could find me a different form?” Eshonai said. “A\nform that would let me talk better, more diplomatically? I could go to the\nhumans and explain what happened. Maybe I could speak with Dalinar\nKholin. I feel like … like he might listen, if I could find him. If I could\nmake my tongue work. They don’t hear the rhythms, and it’s so difficult to\nexplain to them.…”\n“I can try,” Venli said, Pleading sounding in her ears. Why Pleading? She\nhadn’t attuned that.\n“Then maybe I could talk to you,” Eshonai said quietly, drooping from\nfatigue. “Without sounding like I’m trying to lecture. You’d know how I\nreally feel. Mother would understand that I don’t try to run away. I just want\nto see…”\n“You’ll see it someday,” Venli promised. “You’ll see the whole world.\nEvery vibrant color. Every singing wind. Every land and people.”\nEshonai didn’t respond.\n“I … I’ve been doing things you might not like,” Venli whispered. “I\nshould tell you. You’ll explain that what I’m doing is wrong though, and\nyou’re always right. That’s part of what I hate about you.”\nBut her sister had already drifted off.

Venli climbed to\nher feet and left.\nThat night, she went into the storm to hunt stormspren for the first time.\nMaybe if I remembered my life, I’d be capable of being confident like I\nonce was. Maybe I’d stop vacillating when even the most simple of\ndecisions is presented to me.\nThe weather turned energetic by the time Adolin’s trial arrived. The\nhonorspren he passed chatted more, and seemed to have more of a spring to\ntheir steps as they flowed toward the forum on the southern plane of Lasting\nIntegrity.\nHe couldn’t feel the weather, though Blended said it was like a faint\ndrumming in the back of her mind, upbeat and peppy. Indeed, the inkspren\nseemed chattier.\nHe felt more nervous than at his first ranked duel—and far less prepared.\nLegal terms, strategies, even the details of his political training all seemed\ndistant as he walked down the steps to the amphitheater floor. As Blended\nhad feared, the place was packed with honorspren. Many wore uniforms or\nother formal attire, though some wore loose, flowing outfits that trailed\nbehind them as they walked. These seemed more free-spirited. Perhaps their\npresence would help the crowd turn to his side.\nBlended said that was important. The High Judge—being who he was—\nwould likely listen to the mood of the crowd and judge accordingly. Adolin\nwished someone had explained to him earlier how fickle his judge would\nbe. That might favor Adolin, fortunately: he could depend on some level of\nerratic behavior from Kelek, whereas the honorspren were basically all\nagainst him from the start.\nThey didn’t boo as he reached the floor of the forum; they had too much\ndecorum. They hushed instead. He found Shallan seated next to Pattern\nover on the left side. She pumped her fist toward him, and he had the\nimpression she was Radiant at the moment.\nKelek sat upon a thronelike seat with a bench before it, both built in\namong the forum’s tiers. The Herald seemed imposing, and Adolin was\nreminded that—despite the man’s odd behavior—Kelek was thousands of\nyears old. Perhaps he would listen.\n“All right, all right,” Kelek said. “Human, get over there on the podium\nand stand there until this show finishes and we can execute you.”\n“Holy One,” an honorspren said from his side. “We do not execute\npeople.”\n“What else are you going to do?” Kelek said. “You don’t have prisons,\nand I doubt he’ll care if you exile him. Hell, half the people in this place\nwould regard escaping your presence to be a reward.”\n“We are building a proper holding cell,” the honorspren said, looking\ntoward Adolin. “So he can be kept healthy and on display for years to\ncome.”\nWonderful, Adolin thought, stepping into the place indicated. The\nconsequences of failure, however, had always been far bigger than his own\nlife. The war needed Radiants, and Radiants needed spren. If Adolin failed,\nit meant leaving thousands of troops to die without proper support."

If Adolin failed,\nit meant leaving thousands of troops to die without proper support.\nHe needed to stand here, tall and confident, and win this challenge.\nSomehow.\nHe turned to face the crowd. According to Blended, today would be the\nworst of the days. Three witnesses against him. Tomorrow he’d get to have\nhis say.\n“Very well,” Kelek said. “I suppose you need to give trial terms,\nSekeir?”\nThe bearded honorspren stood up. “Indeed, Honored One.”\n“Make it fast,” Kelek said.\nAdolin took a moment of enjoyment from the affronted way Sekeir\nreceived that injunction. The honorspren had likely planned a lengthy\nspeech.\n“As you wish, Honored One,” Sekeir said. “Today, we enter a trial as\ndemanded by this human, Adolin Kholin, to determine if he can bear the\nsins of the Recreance—where men killed their spren. Since this event\nhappened, which no one disputes, then we must simply prove that we are\nwise to stay away from all humans as a result.”\n“Right, then,” Kelek said. “Human, this works for you?”\n“Not exactly, Honored One,” Adolin said, using the opening statement\nBlended had helped him prepare. “I did not agree to be tried for my\nancestors. I agreed to be tried for myself. I told the honorspren I personally\nbear no blame for what humans did in the past. Because of that, I contend\nthat the honorspren are acting dishonorably by ignoring my people’s pleas\nfor help.”\nKelek rubbed his forehead. “So we’re arguing over even the definitions?\nThis doesn’t bode well.”\n“There is no argument,” Sekeir said. “Honored One, he says he wishes to\nbear no sins of his ancestors, and we should instead prove why he\nspecifically can’t be trusted. But the Recreance is a large portion of why we\ncannot trust his kind! We set the terms when he entered: He would have to\nstand trial for all humankind. He can dissemble if he wishes, but he did\nenter our fortress, and therefore agreed to our terms.”\nKelek grunted. “That makes sense. Human, you’re going to have to stand\ntrial as he wishes. That said, I’ll keep your arguments in mind when I finally\njudge.”\n“I suppose I must agree,” Adolin said. Blended had warned him not to\npush too hard here.\n“So … trial by witness, right?” Kelek said. “I’m to listen to the\narguments presented, then decide. Either the honorspren are being selfish,\ndenying honor, and I should command them to go to the battlefield. Or I\ndecide they’ve been wise, that humans are not worthy of trust—and we\nthrow this man in a prison as an example?”\n“Yes, Honored One,” Sekeir said.\n“Great,” Kelek said. “I assume you had no lack of volunteers, Sekeir.\nWho is first?”\n“Amuna,” said the honorspren. “Come, and bear your witness.”\nThe audience whispered quietly as a female spren rose from her spot on"

She wore a warrior’s pleated skirt and a stiff shirt. She was\nslender and willowy, and when she stepped she was as graceful as a leaf in\nthe wind. Adolin recognized her; this was the spren to whom he’d been\nforced to surrender Maya on their first day in Lasting Integrity. He’d\noccasionally seen Amuna again during his daily visits to Maya.\nThe two honorspren sitting beside her bore ragged clothing and\nscratched-out eyes like Maya’s. On a glowing honorspren’s face, the\nscratches made a stark contrast.\n“You all know me,” said the spren in the pleated skirt, “so I will speak\nfor the benefit of Highprince Adolin. I am Amuna, and my duty is to care\nfor the deadeyes in Lasting Integrity. We take their care very seriously.”\n“And the ones watching outside?” Adolin asked. He was allowed to talk\nduring testimonies, though Blended had warned him to be careful. If he was\ntoo belligerent, the High Judge could order him gagged. And he had to be\ncareful not to address the audience in a way that invited them to interrogate\nhim.\n“We … cannot accept them all in, unfortunately,” Amuna said. “We had\nnot thought to see so many. We have tried to invite in all of the honorspren\ndeadeyes.”\n“Are there many?” Adolin asked.\n“In total? We have some twenty deadeyed honorspren in the fortress\nnow, though there were some two thousand honorspren alive at the time of\nyour betrayal. A single one survived.”\n“Syl,” Adolin said.\n“The Ancient Daughter was in a catatonic state,” Amuna said, “and was\nspared. But every other honorspren—every single one—had answered the\ncall of the Radiants during the False Desolation. Can you understand the\nmagnitude of that tragedy, Highprince Adolin? The murder of an entire\nspecies, all in one day? Absolute extermination, performed by the most\nintimate of friends?\n“We often encounter deadeyes wandering aimlessly in the barrens, or\nstanding in the shallows of the ocean. We bring them here, give them\nStormlight, care for them the best we can. Frequently, we can do only a\nlittle before they are summoned away to your world—where their corpses\nare used to continue your brutal murders!”\nShe turned, gesturing toward the two deadeyes on the bench—and\nthough she faced Adolin, her words were obviously for the crowd. They, not\nthe High Judge, were the true adjudicators.\n“This is what you’d have us return to?” she demanded. “You say you\naren’t the same people who lived so long ago, but do you honestly think\nyou’re any better than them? I’d contend you are worse! You pillage, and\nmurder, and burn. You spare no expense nor effort when given an\nopportunity to ruin another man’s life.

They didn’t jeer or call as\na human audience might—he’d suffered that during many a dueling bout.\nBlended had warned him not to say too much by way of defense today, but\nthey seemed to want something from him.\n“Every man fails his own ideals,” Adolin said. “You are right. I am not\nthe honorable man I wish that I were. But my father is. Can you deny that\nthe Stormfather himself was willing to take a chance upon a man from this\nepoch?”\n“This is a good point,” Kelek said, leaning forward. “The Stormfather is\nall we have left of old Tanavast. I would not have thought to find his\nBondsmith again, no indeed.”\nAmuna spun toward Adolin. “Do you know what would happen, Prince\nAdolin, if the Stormfather were to be killed?”\nAdolin paused, then shook his head.\n“A wise answer,” she said. “As no one knows. We were fortunate that no\nBondsmiths existed at the time of the Recreance, though how the Sibling\nknew to end their bond early is a matter of dispute. I can only imagine the\ncatastrophe that awaits us when your father kills his spren.”\n“He won’t,” Adolin said. “My father is no common man.”\n“Such could be said of all the Radiants in times past,” Amuna said,\nstepping toward him. “But now, I am the one who cares for the betrayed. I\nhear their voiceless sorrow; I see their sightless pain. I would have Lasting\nIntegrity pulled down, stone by stone, before I agree to send a single\nhonorspren to suffer a similar fate.”\nShe bowed to Kelek, then turned and sat between the two deadeyes.\nThey continued to sit, faces forward, motionless.\nAdolin ground his teeth and glanced to Shallan for support. At least there\nwas one friendly face out in that crowd. He forced himself to remain\nstanding, hands clasped behind him in the posture his father used when he\nwanted to appear commanding. He’d worn his best coat. For all it mattered.\nStorms, he felt exposed here on the floor, surrounded by all the glowing\nfigures. This was worse than when he’d been alone in the dueling arena\nfacing four Shardbearers. At least then he’d had his Blade in hand and Plate\non his back.\nThey waited for Kelek to call the next witness. The High Judge, instead,\nspent a good twenty minutes writing in his notebook. He was a divine\nbeing, like a kind of ardent, if magnified a thousand times. It wasn’t\nsurprising to see him writing. Adolin just hoped the notes he was taking\nrelated to the testimony. He half expected that the Herald was solving word\npuzzles like the ones Jasnah enjoyed.\nEventually, the Herald dug something out of his pocket—fruit it seemed,\nthough it was bright green and it crunched when Kelek took a bite.\n“Looks good,” Kelek said. “Nothing too unexpected, though I have to\nsay he does have a good point.

Adolin thought as his tutor stood up from the crowd and walked\nto the floor of the arena. The watching honorspren murmured together\nquietly at the sight.\n“Wait,” Adolin said. “What is this?”\n“They asked me to witness against you,” she said. “So a spren who is not\nan honorspren would have a chance to weigh in on this proceeding.”\n“But … you’re my tutor. Didn’t you volunteer to train me?”\n“I wanted you well-trained,” she said, “so the trial could be as fair as\npossible. This thing is. But my hatred of what your kind did also is.” She\nturned to Kelek. “Honored One, I was alive when men betrayed us. Unlike\nthe honorspren, my kind were not so foolish as to assign all as Radiant\nspren. We lost over half our numbers, but some of us watched from\noutside.”\nShe eyed Adolin. “We knew men as they were and are. Untrustworthy.\nChangeable. Spren find it difficult to break a bond. Some say it is\nimpossible for us. Men, however, barely last a day without betraying some\nIdeal.\n“Why should we beings of innate honor have been surprised when the\nevent happened? It is not the fault of men that they are as fickle as the\nfalling rain. This thing is. They should not be trusted, and the shame of\ndoing so is our fault. Never again should spren and men bond. It is\nunnatural.”\n“Unnatural?” Adolin said. “Spren and skyeels bond to fly. Spren and\ngreatshells bond to grow. Spren and singers bond to create new forms. This\nis as natural as the changing seasons.”\nAnd thank you, Shallan, he thought, glancing at her, for your interest in\nall this.\n“Humans are not from this land,” Blended said. “You are invaders, and\nbonds with you are not natural. Be careful what you say—you will\nencourage us to return to the singers. They betrayed us long ago, but never\non the scale of the humans. Perhaps the highspren have the correct idea in\njoining with the armies of the Fused.”\n“You’d side with them?” Adolin said. “Our enemies?”\n“Why not?” she said, strolling across the stage. “They are the rightful\nheirs of this land. They have been pushed to desperation by your kind, but\nthey are no less reasonable or logical. Perhaps your kind would do better to\nacknowledge their rule.”\n“They serve Odium,” Adolin said, noticing many of the honorspren\nshifting in their seats, uncomfortable. “Men might be changeable, yes. We\nmight be corrupt at times, and weak always. But I know evil when I see it.\nOdium is evil. I will never serve him.”"

She gave him a\nlittle nod herself, as if in acknowledgment of a point earned.\n“This tangent is irrelevant,” she said, turning to Kelek. “I can say, with\nsome ease, that a good relationship between honorspren and inkspren is not.\nAny would acknowledge this. My testimony’s value is, then, of extra\nimport.\n“I lived through the pain and chaos of the Recreance. I saw my siblings,\nbeloved, dead. I saw families ripped apart, and pain flowing like blood.

Lock him away. Be done with him\nand any who, like him, wish to repeat the massacre of the past.” She looked\ndirectly at Adolin. “This truth is.”\nAdolin felt at a loss to say anything. What defense could he offer? “We\nare not the same as the ones before,” he said.\n“Can you promise you will be different,” she demanded. “Absolutely\npromise it? Promise that no further spren will be killed from bonds, if\nallowed to be?”\n“Of course not,” Adolin said.\n“Well, I can promise that none will die so long as no more bonds are\nmade. The solution is easy.”\nShe turned and walked back to her place.\nAdolin looked to Kelek. “There are no promises in life. Nothing is sure.\nShe says spren won’t die without bonds, but can you say what will happen\nif Odium reigns?”\n“I find it most curious she’d prefer that possibility, young man,” Kelek\nsaid. He started writing in his notebook again. “But it is seriously damning\nof you that an inkspren would be willing to testify alongside an honorspren.\nDamning indeed…” Kelek took another bite of his fruit, leaving only the\ncore, which he absently set on the table in front of him.\nFrustrated, Adolin forced himself to calm. The trial was proceeding well\non at least one axis. The honorspren weren’t trying to force the actual sins\nof the Recreance on him; they were taking a more honorable approach of\nproving that men hadn’t changed, and bonds were too risky.\nBlended and he had decided this tactic was safer for Adolin; Kelek could\nvery well decide that there was no reason to imprison him for things the\nancients did. At the same time, Adolin was losing the hearts of the watching\nspren. What would it matter if he “won” the trial if the spren were even\nmore strongly convinced they shouldn’t help in the conflict?\nHe searched the crowd, but found mostly resentful expressions. Storms.\nDid he really think he could prove anything to them? Which of the ten fools\nwas he for starting all this?\nNo, I’m not a fool, he told himself. Just an optimist. How can they not\nsee? How can they sit here and judge me, when men are dying and other\nspren fight?\nThe same way, he realized, that the highprinces had spent so long"

How can they sit here and judge me, when men are dying and other\nspren fight?\nThe same way, he realized, that the highprinces had spent so long\nplaying games with the lives of soldiers on the Shattered Plains. The same\nway any man could turn his back on an atrocity if he could persuade\nhimself it wasn’t his business.\nMen and spren were not different. Blended had tried to tell him this, and\nnow he saw it firsthand.\n“The third and final witness,” the honorspren officiator said, “is Notum,\nonce captain of the ship Honor’s Path.”\nAdolin felt his stomach turn as Notum—looking much improved from\nthe last time Adolin had seen him—emerged from the top of the forum,\nwhere a group of standing honorspren had obscured him from Adolin’s\nview. Still, Adolin was shocked. Notum had been forbidden to enter Lasting\nIntegrity despite his wounds, and had stayed with the others outside the\nwalls—though the honorspren of the tower had delivered him some\nStormlight to aid in his healing. Messages from Godeke had indicated that\nNotum had eventually returned to patrol.\nNow he was here—and in uniform, which was telling. He also wouldn’t\nmeet Adolin’s eyes as he stepped down onto the floor of the forum. Spren\nmight claim the moral high ground; they claimed to be made of honor. But\nthey also defined honor for themselves. As men did.\n“Offered to end your exile, did they, Notum?” Adolin asked softly. “In\nexchange for a little backstabbing?”\nNotum continued to avoid his gaze, instead bowing to Kelek, then\nunfolding a sheet of paper from his pocket. He began to read. “I have been\nasked,” he said, “to relate the erratic behavior I witnessed in this man and\nhis companions. As many of you know, I first encountered this group when\nthey fled the Fused in Celebrant over one year ago. They used subterfuge\nto…”\nNotum trailed off and looked toward Adolin.\nGive him Father’s stare, Adolin thought. The stern one that made you\nwant to shrivel up inside, thinking of everything you’d done wrong. A\ngeneral’s stare.\nAdolin had never been good at that stare.\n“Go ahead,” he said instead. “We got you in trouble, Notum. It’s only\nfair that you get a chance to tell your side. I can’t ask anything of you other\nthan honesty.”\n“I…” Notum met his eyes.\n“Go on.”\nNotum lowered his sheet, then said in a loud voice, “Honor is not dead\nso long as he lives in the hearts of men!”\nAdolin had never heard the statement before, but it seemed a trigger to\nthe honorspren crowd, who began standing up and shouting in outrage—or\neven in support. Adolin stepped back, amazed by the sudden burst of\nemotion from the normally stoic spren.\nSeveral officials rushed the floor of the forum, pulling Notum away as he\nbellowed the words. “Honor is not dead so long as he lives in the hearts of\nmen! Honor is not—”\nThey dragged him out of the forum, but the commotion continued.\nAdolin put his hand on his sword, uncertain. Would this turn ugly?"

        "text": "men! Honor is not—”\nThey dragged him out of the forum, but the commotion continued.\nAdolin put his hand on his sword, uncertain. Would this turn ugly?\nKelek shrank down in his seat, looking panicked as he put his hands to\nhis ears. He let out a low whine, pathetic and piteous, and began to shake.\nThe honorspren near him called for order among the crowd, shouting that\nthey were causing pain to the Holy One.\nMany seemed outraged at Notum’s words, but a sizable number took up\nhis cry—and these were pushed physically out of the forum. There was a\ntension to this society Adolin hadn’t seen before. The honorspren were no\nmonolith; disagreement and tension swam in deep waters here—far below\nthe surface, but still powerful.\nThe officiators cleared the forum—even Shallan and Pattern were forced\nout. Everyone basically ignored Adolin. As the place finally settled down,\nand only a few officials remained, Adolin walked up the few forum steps to\nthe High Judge’s seat. Kelek lounged in his seat, ignoring the fact that he’d\nbeen curled up on the floor trembling mere moments earlier.\n“What was that?” Adolin asked him.\n“Hmmm?” Kelek said. “Oh, nothing of note. An old spren argument.\nYour coming has opened centuries-old wounds, young man. Amusing, isn’t\nit?”\n“Amusing? That’s all?”\nKelek started whistling as he wrote in his notebook.\nThey’re all insane, Adolin thought. Ash said so. This is what thousands\nof years of torture does to a mind.\nPerhaps it was best not to push on the raw wound.\n“That went well for me today, wouldn’t you say?” Adolin asked him.\n“Hmm?” Kelek said.\n“One witness could not refute my point about my father,” Adolin said.\n“Another made my argument for me by pointing out that siding against the\nRadiants is practically serving Odium. Then Notum put his honor before his\nown well-being. It went well for me.”\n“Does it matter?” Kelek asked.\n“Of course it does. That’s why I’m here.”\n“I see,” Kelek said. “Did the ancient Radiants betray their spren, killing\nthem?”\n“Well, yes,” Adolin said. “But that’s not the question. The question is\nwhether modern humans can be blamed.”\nKelek continued writing.\n“Honored One?” Adolin asked.\n“Do you know how old I am, young man?” Kelek looked up and met\nAdolin’s eyes, and there was something in them. A depth that made him, for\nthe first time, seem distinctly inhuman. Those eyes seemed like eternal\nholes. Bored through time.\n“I,” Kelek said softly, “have known many, many men. I’ve known some\nof the best who ever lived. They are now broken or dead. The best of us\ninevitably cracked. Storms … I ran when the Return came this time,\nbecause I knew what it meant. Even Taln … Even Taln…”\n“He didn’t break,” Adolin said.\n“The enemy is here, so he did,” Kelek said firmly. He waved toward the\nhonorspren. “They deserve better than you, son.

I could never judge them for refusing to bond men. How could I? I\ncould never order them back into that war, back into that hole. To do so\nwould be to … to abandon what little honor I have left.…”\nAdolin took a deep breath. Then he nodded.\n“I just told you that your cause is hopeless,” Kelek said, turning to his\nwriting. “You do not seem concerned.”\n“Well, Honored One,” Adolin said. “I agreed to this trial—even with\nSekeir’s insistence I be blamed for what my ancestors did—because it was\nthe only way to get a chance to talk to the honorspren. Maybe you will\njudge against me—but so long as I get a chance to have my say, then that\nwill be enough. If I persuade even one or two to join the battle, I’ll have\nwon.”\n“Optimism,” Kelek said. “Hope. I remember those things. But I don’t\nthink you understand the stakes of this trial, child—nor do you understand\nwhat you’ve stumbled into. The things that inkspren said—about joining\nOdium’s side—are on the minds of many spren. Including many in this very\nfortress.”\nThat hit Adolin like a gut punch. “Honorspren would join the enemy?”\nAdolin said. “That would make them no better than the highspren!”\n“Indeed; I suspect their dislike of highspren is part of why they hesitate.\nThe honorspren in favor of joining the enemy worried how such a\nsuggestion would be received. But here you are, giving them a chance to\nmake their arguments, acting as a magnet for all of their frustration and\nhatred.\n“Many are listening. If honorspren start joining the enemy … well, many\nother varieties of spren would soon follow. I dare think they’d go in large\nnumbers.” Kelek didn’t look up. “You came here to recruit. But I suspect\nyou will end up tipping these finely balanced scales, and not in the direction\nyou desire.”\n* * *\nAbout an hour after the first stage of the trial—an hour she’d spent\nconsoling Adolin in his sudden terror that he would accidentally cause a\nmass defection of spren to the side of the enemy—Shallan climbed a tree.\nShe stretched high, clinging to a branch near the top. It was a normal\ntree, one of the real ones the honorspren managed to grow here. It felt good\nto feel bark beneath her fingers.\nShe reached with one arm into the open space above the tree, but\ncouldn’t feel anything different. Had she hit the barrier yet? Maybe a little\nfarther …\nShe shimmied a little higher, then reached out, and thought she felt an\noddity as she got exactly high enough. An invisible tugging on the tips of\nher fingers.\nThen her foot slipped.\nIn a second she was tumbling through the air. She didn’t fall all the way\nto the base of the structure, merely to the floor of her plane. She hit with a\nloud crack, then lay dazed before letting out a loud groan."

She hit with a\nloud crack, then lay dazed before letting out a loud groan.\nLusintia the honorspren was at her side a moment later.\nAs I suspected … Veil thought. She always seems to be nearby. She’d\nclearly been assigned to watch Shallan.\n“Human!” she said, her short hair hanging along the sides of her white-\nblue face. “Human, are you hurt?”\nShallan groaned, blinking.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said, stepping over. “Rapid eye blinks. This is serious.\nShe could die.”\n“Die?” Lusintia said. “I had no idea they were so fragile!”\n“That was a long fall,” Pattern said. “Ah, and she hit her head when she\nlanded on the stones here. Not good, not good.”\nOther honorspren were gathering, muttering to themselves. Shallan\ngroaned again, then tried to focus on Pattern and Lusintia, but let her eyes\nslip shut.\n“We must act quickly,” Pattern said. “Quickly!”\n“What do we do!” Lusintia said.\n“You have no hospital here?”\n“Of course we don’t have a hospital!” Lusintia said. “There are only a\ncouple dozen humans here.”\n“Mmm … but you won’t let them come back in if they leave, so they are\nbasically caged here. You should feel bad. Very bad. Yes.”\nStorms, Veil thought. Is that the best he can do? How did we ever let him\nfool us?\n“Tell me what to do!” Lusintia said. “Do we carry her out to that\nEdgedancer?”\n“It will take too long. She will die. Poor human whom I love very much.\nIt will be tragic for her to die here, in the center of honorspren power and\nprotection. Unless, of course, she were to be given Stormlight.”\n“Wait … Stormlight?”\n“Yes, she is Radiant,” Pattern said. “It would heal her.”\nShallan suppressed a smile. Pattern was a tad transparent, but the\nhonorspren here plainly had little experience with humans. They swallowed\nthe bait without question, and soon Shallan was being carried by a team of\nfour. She tucked away the piece of cloth-wrapped stone she’d used to smack\nthe ground as she landed, giving the impression that she’d hit her head.\nIn reality, her arm did ache. She had undoubtedly bruised it when she hit,\nthough this wasn’t the worst self-inflicted wound she’d sustained in the\nname of science. At least this time her scheme hadn’t involved deliberately\nembarrassing herself in front of several attractive men.\nShe made sure to groan occasionally, and Pattern kept exclaiming how\nworried he was. That kept Lusintia and the other honorspren motivated as\nthey hauled Shallan to a specific building, their footfalls echoing against\nenclosing stone.\nThey had a hushed but urgent conversation with a guard. Shallan made a\nparticularly poignant whimper of pain at exactly the right moment, and then\nshe was in. Light surrounded her as she was brought someplace brilliant.\nThey hadn’t let her in here last time, when they retrieved Stormlight for\nAdolin’s healing."

Light surrounded her as she was brought someplace brilliant.\nThey hadn’t let her in here last time, when they retrieved Stormlight for\nAdolin’s healing.\nShe let her eyes flutter open and found that most of the Stormlight was\ncontained in a large construction at the center of the room. A kind of vat, or\ntall jar. This was technology Shallan hadn’t heard of before coming to\nShadesmar, and apparently not even the honorspren knew how it worked.\nThey could be purchased from a group of strange traveling merchants called\nthe Eyree.\nShelves nearby held a collection of loose gemstones, each glowing\nbrightly. The wealth of Lasting Integrity: gemstones—gathered over\nmillennia—so flawless, so perfect, that they didn’t leak. She’d been told a\ngemstone like this could, with repeated exposures to storms, absorb far\nmore Stormlight than its size should be able to contain.\nShe tested this, reaching out with a weak hand toward one of them and\nsucking in a breath of Stormlight—which streamed to her as a glowing,\nmisty white light.\nShe immediately felt better: invigorated, alert. Storms, how she’d missed\nthat. Simply holding Stormlight was stimulating. She grinned—not part of\nthe act—then decided to leap to her feet. The ache in her arm vanished; she\nfelt like dancing with joy.\nInstead she let Veil take over. This next part needed her—Shallan\nremained the better actress, but Veil was better at most other espionage\nskills.\nVeil made a show of touching her head where she’d been “wounded.”\n“What happened?” she asked. “I don’t remember. I was trying to see if I\ncould reach the barrier where the gravity of the plane ran out.”\n“You were very foolish, human,” Lusintia said. “You are so fragile! How\ncould you endanger yourself in such a manner? Do you not realize that\nmortals die if broken?”\n“It was in the name of science,” Veil said, reaching to her waist where\nshe’d secured her notebook before climbing. She yanked it out and dropped\nit in a flurry. At the same time she swept her safehand to the side and\ndropped a dun emerald in place of a brightly glowing one.\nThe sleight of hand—performed hundreds of times beneath Tyn’s watch,\nthen perfected on her own—was covered as she stumbled and brushed the\nshelf, disturbing the many gems and shaking their light. She was able to slip\nthe stolen emerald into her black leather glove.\nThis all happened in the moment the honorspren focused on her falling\nnotebook. Veil quickly snatched it off the ground and held it to her chest,\ngrinning sheepishly.\n“Thank you,” she said. “You saved my life.”\n“We would not have you die,” Lusintia said. “Death is a terrible thing,\nand we…” She trailed off, looking at the shelf and the dun emerald it now\ncontained. “Storms alight! You ate the entire thing? Human, how…”\nAnother spren, an angry male in uniform, began shoving Shallan out.\n“That was years’ worth of stored Stormlight!” he exclaimed. “Get out! Go,\nbefore you eat anything more! If you fall again, I will have you turned\naway!”"

An embarrassed Lusintia was forced to stay behind and fill out a\nreport on the incident.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “Thank you for letting me lie. Did it work?”\nVeil nodded.\n“Mmm. They are stupid.”\n“Stupidity and ignorance are not the same thing,” Veil said. “They’re just\nunaccustomed to both humans and subterfuge. Come on. Let’s make\nourselves scarce before someone thinks to search me.”\nA YEAR AND A HALF AGO\nA banging came on the door, and Eshonai pulled it open and stared out into\na tempest. Grand lightning flashes shattered the blackness in brief emotional\nbouts, revealing Venli, her eyes wide, grinning and soaked, clutching\nsomething in two hands before her.\nShe stumbled into the room, trailing water—which caused their mother\nto chide her. Jaxlim was in one of her … episodes where she saw the two of\nthem as children.\nVenli—seemingly oblivious to anything other than the gemstone—\nwandered past their mother. She rubbed her thumb on the gemstone, which\nwas about a third the size of her fist.\n“Storms,” Eshonai said, pushing the door closed. “You did it?” She set\nthe beam in place, then left it rattling in the wind as she stepped over to\nVenli.\nBut … no, the gemstone wasn’t glowing. Was it? Eshonai leaned closer.\nIt was glowing, but barely.\n“It worked,” Venli whispered to Awe, clutching the stone. “It finally\nworked. The secret is lightning, Eshonai! It pulls them through. When I\ndrew close enough right after a strike, I found hundreds of them. I snagged\nthis one before the others returned to the other side.…”\n“The other side?” Eshonai asked.\nVenli didn’t respond. She seemed like a different person lately, always\nexhausted from working long nights—and from her insistence on going out\nin each and every storm to try to capture a stormspren. And now this. Venli\ncradled the gemstone, ignoring the water streaming from her clothing.\n“Venli?” Eshonai said. “If you want my help in bringing this to the Five,\nyou will need to let me see what you’ve done.”\nVenli stared at her, quiet, no rhythm at all. Then she stood tall and\nhummed to Confidence, proffering the gemstone. Eshonai attuned Curiosity\nand took it. Yes … it did have a spren inside, though it glowed with an odd\nlight. Too dark, almost dusty. Smoky. It was difficult to tell its color through\nthe green of the emerald, but it seemed shadowed, like lightning deep\nwithin the clouds.\n“This spren is unlike any I’ve ever seen,” Eshonai said.\n“Stormform,” Venli whispered. “Power.”\n“Dangerous power. This could destroy the listeners.”"

Don’t you think that this time, instead of making a snap decision\nbased on songs from thousands of years ago, we should at least try a\ndifferent solution?”\nRumbling thunder outside seemed to agree with Venli’s words. Eshonai\nhanded the gemstone back, then hummed to Betrayal to indicate what she\nthought of Venli’s argument. But the rhythm didn’t express how deeply the\nwords cut.\nTurning her back on her sister, Eshonai walked to the door again and\nthrew aside the bar. Ignoring both Venli and her mother as they cried\nobjections, Eshonai stepped out into the storm.\nThe wind hit her hard, but in warform’s armor she barely felt the icy\nraindrops. She stood in the light spilling from the door until Venli pushed it\nclosed, plunging Eshonai into darkness.\nShe attuned the Rhythm of Winds and started walking. Humans feared\nthe storms. They always hid indoors. Eshonai respected the storms, and\nusually preferred to meet them with a stormshield. But she did not fear\nthem.\nShe walked away from her mother’s house, eastward into the wind.\nThese days, her life had constantly been against the wind. It blew so hard,\nshe barely felt she was making progress. Maybe she’d have been better off\nletting it steer her.\nIf she hadn’t fought so much—if she hadn’t spent so much time thinking\nabout her explorations or her dreams—would she have settled into her role\nas general faster? If she’d doubled down on her raids at the start, would she\nhave been able to shove the humans out of the warcamps before they got a\nfoothold?\nLike a rockbud, humans were. Soft at first, but capable of gripping onto\nthe stone and growing into something practically immovable. In this—\ndespite their lack of rhythms—they belonged to Roshar better than the\nlisteners did. If she could truly travel the world, would she find them\ngrowing in every crevice?\nShe neared the edge of the plateau that made up the central heart of\nNarak, the city of exile. She walked carefully, letting flashes of lightning\nguide her way. She stepped right up to the edge of the chasm, facing into\nthe wind.\n“What do you want from us?” she shouted. “Answer me, Rider! Spren of\nthe storm! You’re a traitor like us, aren’t you? Is that why you sent Venli\nthose little spren?”\nThe wind blasted her, as if to push her off balance. Debris spun and\nsputtered in the wind, spiraling around her—the lightning making each\npiece seem frozen in the moment. A quick sequence of bolts struck nearby,\nand the thunder vibrated and rattled her carapace. Absolute darkness\nfollowed.\nAt first she thought maybe the Rider of Storms had chosen to appear to\nher. However, this darkness was ordinary. She could still feel the wind, rain,\nand debris.\n“What kind of choice is this?” she demanded. “Either we let the humans"

Was this a prayer, then?\nDidn’t make a lot of sense, considering that the very thing she resisted was\na return to her people’s old gods.\nThose gods had never deserved reverence. What was a god who only\nmade demands? Nothing but a tyrant with a different name.\n“Everything I’ve done,” she said into the wind, “has been to ensure we\nremain our own people. That’s all I want. I gave up my dreams. But I will\nnot give up our minds.”\nBrave words. Useless words. They would have to take Venli’s discovery\nto the Five, and they would have to let her test it. Eshonai knew that as well\nas she knew the Rhythm of Peace. They couldn’t reject a potential new\nform now.\nShe turned to go, then heard something. Rock scraping on rock? Was the\nplateau cracking? Though she could barely hear it, the noise must be quite\nloud to reach her over the din of the tempest.\nEshonai stepped backward—but her footing seemed unsteady, and she\ndidn’t want to move without a flash of lightning to guide her. What if—\nBranching light flashed in the heavens far to the east. It lit the sky white,\nhighlighting debris, illuminating the land around her. Everything except for\nan enormous shadow silhouetted in front of her.\nEshonai’s breath caught. The rhythms froze in her head. That shape …\nsinuous, yet massive. Claws as thick as her body gripping the rim of the\nchasm mere feet in front of her. It couldn’t be—\nLightning flashed again, and she saw its face. A chasmfiend snout, with\njagged swords for teeth, head cocked to the side to watch her.\nShe didn’t run. If it wanted her, she was already dead. Prey ran, and the\nbeasts were known to play with things that acted like prey, even if they\nweren’t hungry. Still, standing there in pitch-darkness—not daring to attune\na rhythm—was the hardest thing she’d ever done.\nWhen the lightning next flashed, the chasmfiend had lowered its\nincredible head toward her, its eye close enough that she could have stabbed\nit without needing to lunge.\nDarkness fell. Then a small burst of light appeared directly ahead of her.\nA small spren made of white fire. It zipped forward, trailing an afterimage.\nLike a falling star. It moved closer, then spun around her.\nBy its light, she could see the chasmfiend slowly retreat into the chasm,\nits spikelike claws leaving scores on the stone. Her heart beating like\nthunder, Eshonai attuned Anxiety and hurried home. The strange little spren\nfollowed her.\nInstead I think, if I were to remember my life in detail, I would become\neven worse. Paralyzed by my terrible actions.

Navani barely noticed.\nFor the first time in her life, she let go completely. No worries about\nDalinar or Jasnah. No worries about the tower. No thoughts about the\nmillion other things she should be doing.\nThis was what she should be doing.\nOr so she allowed herself to believe. She let herself be free. In her little\nroom of a laboratory, everything fit together. She’d met scholars who\nclaimed they needed chaos to function. Perhaps that was true for some, but\nin her experience, good science wasn’t about sloppy inspiration. It was\nabout meticulous incrementalization.\nWith no distractions, she was able to draw up precise experiments—\ncharts, careful measurements, lines. Science was all about lines, about\nimposing order on chaos. Navani reveled in her careful preparations,\nwithout anyone to tease her for keeping her charts so neat or for refusing to\nskip any steps.\nSometimes Raboniel visited and joined in the research, writing her own\nmusings alongside Navani’s in their notebook. Two opposing forces in\nharmony, focused on a single goal.\nRaboniel gave her the strange black sand, explaining the difference\nbetween static and kinetic Investiture. Navani observed and measured,\nlearning for herself. The sand slowly turned white when exposed to\nStormlight or Voidlight. However, if a fabrial was using the Light, the sand\nchanged faster.\nYou could wet the sand to reset it to black, though it had to be dry again\nbefore it could turn white. It was a useful way to measure how much Light\na given fabrial was using. She noticed that it also changed colors in the\npresence of spren. This was a slow change too, but she could measure it.\nAnything you could measure was useful to science. But for these few\nblessed days, it seemed like time was not properly measurable—for hours\npassed like minutes. And Navani, despite the circumstances, found herself\nloving the experience.\n* * *\n“I don’t know exactly where the sand comes from,” Raboniel said, settled\non her stool beside the wall, flipping through Navani’s latest set of charts.\n“Offworld somewhere.”\n“Offworld?” Navani asked, looking up from the fabrial she’d been\nhousing. “As in … another … planet?”\nRaboniel hummed absently. A confirmation? Navani felt she could tell\nwhat this rhythm meant.\n“I wanted to go, for years,” Raboniel said. “Visit the place myself.\nUnfortunately, I learned it wasn’t possible. I’m trapped in this system, my\nsoul bound to Braize—you call it Damnation—a planet farther out in orbit\naround the sun.”\nTo hear her speak of such things so casually amazed Navani. Other\nworlds. The best telescopes couldn’t do more than confirm the existence of\nother celestial bodies, but here she was, speaking to someone who had\nvisited one of them.\nWe came from another, Navani reminded herself.

You’d have to get through\nthe storm to travel there anyway.”\n“The Everstorm?”\nRaboniel hummed to an amused rhythm. “No, no, Navani. You can’t\ntravel to Braize in the Physical Realm. That would take … well, I have no\nidea how long. Plus there’s no air in the space between planets. We sent\nHeavenly Ones to try it once. No air, and worse, the strange pressures\nrequired them to carry a large supply of Voidlight for healing. Even so\nprepared, they died within hours.\n“One instead travels to other worlds through Shadesmar. But again, stay\naway from Braize. Even if you could get through the barrier storm, the\nplace is barren, devoid of life. Merely a dark sky, endless windswept crags,\nand a broken landscape. And a lot of souls. A lot of not particularly sane\nsouls.”\n“I’ll … remember that.”\nOther worlds. It seemed too vast a concept for her to grasp right now—\nand that was saying something, as she was presently contemplating the\ndeath of a god. She turned to her experiment. “Ready.”\n“Excellent,” Raboniel said, closing the book. “Mizthla?”\nNavani’s stormform guard entered the room, seeming somewhat\nannoyed. Though that was common for him. “Mizthla” was his singer\nname; he said the Alethi had called him Dah. A simple glyph instead of a\ntrue name, because it was easier to remember. Perhaps if she had lived her\nentire life called something because of its utility, Navani would have shared\nhis disposition.\nShe presented him with the fabrial, which was … well, not a true fabrial.\nThe housing was a mere coil of copper wires around some gemstones.\nRaboniel knew a method of changing the polarity of a magnet, a process\ninvolving the lightning channeled from a stormform. Captive lightning\nseemed to have boundless potential applications, but Navani kept herself\nfocused—maybe the polarity-swapping process would also work on\ngemstones filled with Voidlight.\nNavani and Raboniel left the room, as the lightning could be\nunpredictable. “Remember,” Navani said on her way out, “only a tiny\nrelease of energy. Don’t melt the coils this time.”\n“I’m not an idiot,” the Regal said to her. “Anymore.”\nOutside, Navani glanced down the hallway—lined with boxes of\nequipment, some hiding her traps—toward the shield around the Sibling. It\nseemed darker inside than before.\nShe and Raboniel avoided the topic. Working closely together did not\nmake them allies, and both recognized it. In fact, Navani had been trying to\nfind a way to hide future discoveries from Raboniel, if she made any.\nLightning flashed in the room, then Mizthla called for them. They\nhurried in as he set the coiled-up fabrial on the desk. It was likely still hot to\nthe touch, so Navani gave it a few minutes, despite wanting to rip the\ngemstones out immediately to inspect the result."

Why?”\n“I’ve always been too busy to engage in true scholarship, Ancient One,”\nNavani said. “Plus, I don’t know that I have the mind for it; I’m not the\ngenius my daughter is. So I’ve always seen it as my duty to grant patronage\nto true scholars, to publicize their creations and see them properly\nencouraged.”\nRaboniel hummed a rhythm, then picked up the fabrial with the copper\ncoiling it. The metal burned her fingers, but she healed from it. “If you are\nnot a scholar, Navani,” she said, “then I have never met one.”\n“I admit that I have trouble accepting that, Ancient One. Though I’m\npleased to have fooled you.”\n“Humility,” Raboniel said. “It’s not a Passion my kind often promote.\nWould it help you believe if I told you that you no longer have to use titles\nwhen speaking to me? Your discoveries so far are enough to recommend\nyou as my equal.”\nThis seemed an uncommon privilege. “It does help, Raboniel,” Navani\nsaid. “Thank you.”\n“Thanks need not be provided for something self-evident,” Raboniel\nsaid, holding up the fabrial. “Are you ready?”\nNavani nodded. Raboniel pulled the gemstones out from within the coil,\nthen inspected them. “The Voidlight seems unchanged to me,” she said.\nNavani hadn’t expressly told Raboniel she was hunting for anti-\nVoidlight. She shrouded her quest in many different kinds of experiments—\nlike this one, where she explained she simply wanted to see if Light\nresponded to exposure to lightning. She suspected that Raboniel suspected,\nhowever, that Navani was at least still intrigued by the idea of anti-Light.\nNavani sprinkled some of the black sand on the tabletop, then placed the\ngemstone in the center, measuring the strength of the Investiture inside. But\nbecause the air didn’t warp around this gemstone, she secretly knew her\nexperiment had failed. This was not anti-Voidlight. She made a note in her\nlog. Another failed experiment.\nRaboniel hummed a rhythm. A regretful one? Yes, that was what it\nseemed to be. “I should return to my duties,” she said, and Navani could\npick out the same rhythm in her voice. “The Deepest Ones are close to\nfinding the final node.”\n“How?” Navani asked.\n“You know I can’t tell you that, Navani.” Though she had spoken of\nleaving, she remained sitting. “I’m so tired of this war. So tired of\ncapturing, killing, losing, dying.”\n“We should end it then.”\n“Not while Odium lives.”\n“You’d actually kill him?” Navani asked. “If you had the chance?”\nRaboniel hummed, but looked away. That humming is …\nembarrassment? Navani thought. She recognizes she’s lied to me, at least by\nimplication. She doesn’t truly want to kill Odium."

She doesn’t truly want to kill Odium.\n“When you were hunting the opposite of Voidlight, you didn’t want to\nuse it against him,” Navani guessed. “You teased me with the idea, but you\nhave another purpose.”\n“You learn to read rhythms,” Raboniel said, standing up.\n“Or I simply understand logic.” Navani stood, and took Raboniel’s\nhands. The Fused allowed it. “You don’t have to kill the Sibling. Let’s find\nanother path.”\n“I’m not killing the Sibling,” Raboniel said. “I’m … doing something\nworse. I’m unmaking the Sibling.”\n“Then let’s find another path.”\n“You think I haven’t searched for one already?” She removed her hands\nfrom Navani’s, then picked up and proffered their notebook, the one where\nthey logged their experiments. Rhythm of War, they called it. Odium and\nHonor working together, if only for a short time.\n“I’ve run some experiments on the conjoined rubies you created—the\nones of different sizes,” Raboniel said. “I think you’ll like the implications\nof what I’ve discovered; I wrote them in here earlier. This might make\nmoving your enormous sky platforms easier.”\n“Raboniel,” Navani said, taking the notebook. “Negotiate with me, help\nme. Let’s join forces. Let’s make a treaty, you and I, ignoring Odium.”\n“I’m sorry,” the Fused said. “But the best chance we have of ending this\nwar—barring a discovery between us—is for my kind to control Urithiru. I\nwill finish my work with the Sibling. Ultimately, we are still enemies. And I\nwould not be where I am—able to contemplate a different solution—if I\nwere not fully willing to do what has been asked of me. Regardless of the\ncost, and regardless of the pain it causes.”\nNavani steeled herself. “I had not thought otherwise, Lady of Wishes.\nThough it leaves me sorrowful.” On a whim, she tried humming to the\nRhythm of War. It didn’t work—the rhythm required two people in concert\nwith one another.\nIn return, however, Raboniel smiled. “I would give you something,” she\nsaid, then left.\nConfused, Navani sat at the table, feeling tired. These days of furious\nstudy were catching up to her. Had it been selfish to spend so much time\npretending to be a scholar? Didn’t Urithiru beg for a queen? Yes, it would\nbe wonderful to find a power to use against Odium, but … did she really\nthink she could solve such a complex problem?\nNavani tried to return to her experiments. After an hour, she conceded\nthat the spark wasn’t there. For all her talk of control and organization, she\nnow found herself subject to the whims of emotion. She couldn’t work\nbecause she didn’t “feel” it. She would have called that nonsense—though\nof course not to their face—if one of her scholars had told her something\nsimilar.\nShe stood abruptly, her chair clattering to the ground.

She’d picked up a\nhabit of pacing from Dalinar, and found herself prowling back and forth in\nthe small chamber. Eventually Raboniel appeared in the doorway,\naccompanied by two nimbleform singers.\nThe Fused waved, and the femalens hurried into the room. They carried\nodd equipment, including two thin metal plates perhaps a foot and a half\nsquare and a fraction of an inch thick, with some odd ridges and\ncrenellations cut into them. The nimbleforms attached them to Navani’s\ndesk with clamps, so the metal plates spread flat, one on each side—like\nadditions to the desk’s workspace.\n“This is an ancient form of music among my kind,” Raboniel said. “A\nway to revel in the rhythms. As a gift, I have decided to share the songs\nwith you.”\nShe gestured and hummed to the two young singers, who jumped to\nobey, each pulling out a long bow—like one might use on a stringed\ninstrument. They drew these along the sides of the metal plates, and the\nmetal began to vibrate with deep tones, though they had a rougher texture\nto them. Full and resonant.\nThose are Honor’s and Odium’s tones, Navani thought. Only these were\nthe shifted versions that worked in harmony with one another.\nRaboniel stepped up beside Navani. In accompaniment to the two tones,\nshe played a loud rhythm with two sticks on a small drum. The sequence of\nbeats grew loud and stately, then soft and fast, alternating. It wasn’t exactly\nthe Rhythm of War, but it was as close as music could likely get. It vibrated\nthrough Navani, loud and triumphant.\nThey continued at it for an extended time, before Raboniel called a stop\nand the two young singers—sweating from the work of vigorously making\nthe tones—quickly gathered the plates, unclamping them from the sides of\nthe desk.\n“Did you like it?” Raboniel asked her.\n“I did,” Navani said. “The tones were a terrible cacophony when\ncombined, but somehow beautiful at the same time.”\n“Like the two of us?” Raboniel asked.\n“Like the two of us.”\n“By this music,” Raboniel said, “I give you the title Voice of Lights,\nNavani Kholin. As is my right.”\nRaboniel hummed curtly, then bowed to Navani. With no other words,\nshe waved for the singers to take their equipment and go. Raboniel retreated\nwith them.\nFeeling overwhelmed, Navani walked up to the open notebook on her\ndesk. Inside, Raboniel had written about their experiments in the women’s\nscript—and her handwriting was growing quite practiced.\nNavani understood the honor in what she’d just been given. At the same\ntime, she found it difficult to feel proud. What did a title, or the respect of\none of the Fused, mean if the tower was still being corrupted, her people\nstill dominated?\nThis is why I worked so hard these last few days, Navani admitted to\nherself, sitting at the desk.

But … what good was\nthat if it didn’t lead to peace?\nThe Rhythm of War vibrated through her, proof that there could be\nharmony. At the same time, the nearly clashing tones told another story.\nHarmony could be reached, but it was exceedingly difficult.\nWhat kind of emulsifier could you use with people, to make them mix?\nShe closed the notebook, then made her way to the back of the room and\nrested her hand on the Sibling’s crystal vein.\n“I have tried to find a way to merge spren who were split by fabrial\ncreation,” she whispered. “I thought it might please you.”\nNo response came.\n“Please,” Navani said, closing her eyes and resting her forehead against\nthe wall. “Please forgive me. We need you.”\nI … The voice came into her mind, making Navani look up. She couldn’t\nsee the spark of the Sibling’s light in the vein, however. Either it wasn’t\nthere, or … or it had grown too dim to see in the light of the room.\n“Sibling?” she asked.\nI am cold, the voice said, small, almost imperceptible. They are killing …\nkilling me.\n“Raboniel said she is … unmaking you.”\nIf that is true I … I will … I will die.\n“Spren can’t die,” Navani said.\nGods can die … Fused can … can die … Spren can … die. If I am made\ninto someone else, that is death. It is dark. The singer you promised me\nthough … I can see him sometimes. I like watching him. He is with the\nRadiants. He would have made … a good … a good bond.…\n“Then bond him!” Navani said.\nCan’t. Can’t see. Can’t act through the barrier.\n“What if I brought you Stormlight?” Navani said. “Infused you the same\nway they’ve been infusing you with Voidlight? Would that slow the\nprocess?”\nCold. They listen. I’m afraid, Navani.\n“Sibling?”\nI don’t … want … to die.…\nAnd then silence. Navani was left with that haunting word, die, echoing\nin her mind. At the moment, the Sibling’s fear seemed far more powerful\nthan the Rhythm of War.\nNavani had to do something. Something more than sitting around\ndaydreaming. She stalked back to her desk to write down ideas—any ideas,\nno matter how silly—about what she could do to help. But as she sat, she\nnoticed something. Her previous experiment rested there, mostly forgotten.\nA gemstone amid sand. When the singers had set up their plates, they hadn’t\ndisturbed Navani’s work.\nThe music of the plates had caused the entire desktop to vibrate. And that\nhad made the sand vibrate—and it had therefore made patterns on her\ndesktop. One pattern on the right, a different on the left, and a third where\nthe two mixed.\nStormlight and Voidlight weren’t merely types of illumination. They\nweren’t merely strange kinds of fluid. They were sounds. Vibrations.\nAnd in vibration, she’d find their opposites."

They’ll inevitably claim me, even here in the honorspren\nstronghold.\nAdolin stepped onto his podium at the honorspren forum. The circular disc\nhad been pulled out to the center of the arena. Today, he would have the\nstage all to himself.\nHe’d arrived early, so he wouldn’t have to push his way through the\ncrowd. He wanted to appear in control, awaiting their scorn rather than\ntaking the long walk down the steps with everyone watching. One felt like\nthe action of a man who had orchestrated his situation. The other felt like a\nprisoner being led to execution.\nShallan and Pattern seated themselves as others began to arrive. The\nforum could hold a couple hundred spren, and as the honorspren—all\nglowing faintly white-blue—settled, he noted that far more of them wore\nuniforms today. The ones who had seemed sympathetic to Notum’s\nproclamation were conspicuously absent from the seats. Adolin found that\nfrustrating, though he did notice some spren from yesterday crowding\naround the top, where they could stand and watch.\nThe honorspren seemed determined to seed the seated positions with\nthose who were predisposed against him. No reason to sweat, Adolin\nthought, standing with his hands clasped behind his back. It’s just your one\nchance to speak for yourself. Your one chance to turn all this around.\nIdeally, this would be the day that went best for him. He could explain\nhis case and answer questions from the audience. Kelek’s words from the\nday before weighed heavily upon him; this wasn’t merely about the\nhonorspren and whether some would join the Windrunners. It was a much\nlarger argument.\nWas humankind worth fighting for? Adolin somehow had to make that\nargument today. Blended had warned him he’d need to fend off questions\nand keep the argument on topic. He couldn’t afford to engage the crowd too\ndirectly, couldn’t afford to let them control the conversation.\nThat done, the trial would convene for one final meeting, where the\nhonorspren could present a single last witness, whom Adolin could\nquestion, to rebut his arguments.\nHe bowed to Kelek as the Herald arrived. He’d changed into official-\nlooking violet robes, a marked difference from yesterday. Did that mean he\nwas taking this more seriously?\nAdolin waited respectfully for the High Judge to seat himself among the\ngroup of honorspren officials. Adolin had learned that six of them were\namong the “ten honored by storms.” The ten oldest existing honorspren,\nother than Syl. Hierarchy was important to this group.\n“All right,” Kelek said. “Let’s get this over with. You may speak.”\n“Thank you, Honored One,” Adolin said, then turned toward the crowd.\n“I don’t think my words today will surprise anyone. Yet I’ve staked my\nfuture on the opportunity to say them to you. In person. To look you in the\neyes, and ask you if you truly think this is justice."

He glanced up at the top of\nthe forum, where the standing spren were shuffling and whispering to one\nanother. The audience fell quiet, waiting for Adolin. A question had been\nasked, but he didn’t have to answer it, not yet. He controlled the floor.\nSo he remained focused as Blended had taught him, then purposefully\ncontinued his statement. “In you,” Adolin said to the crowd, “I had hoped to\nfind honor. Ancient spren bonded with us because they believed that\ntogether, we became something stronger, something better than we were\nalone.\n“I admit to human weakness. I will not hide it. But I have not seen you\nadmit to your weakness. You claim to be creations of honor. That you are\nbetter than men. Yet you refuse to prove it, to show it.\n“I know of spren who do. Brave spren, who have come to the battle to\njoin with men. In so doing, they have become stronger. They grow, like the\npeople who bond them. Why do we need Radiants? Because they represent\nour best selves. We are of Honor and Cultivation. Honor, for an ideal.\nCultivation, for the power to reach toward that ideal.\n“The Stormfather himself agrees that this is the correct choice. People\nmay not be perfect, but they’re worth helping strive for perfection. And you\nare worth more than you can ever be sitting alone and refusing to grow.”\nThat went over well. The honorspren liked a good speech, he’d learned\n—and those at the top in particular seemed swayed. He took a breath,\npreparing to move to his next point. Unfortunately, in the pause, that same\nhonorspren from before leaped to his feet.\n“The Stormfather made his choice,” the spren said loudly, “and in so\ndoing, put himself in danger—he nearly died. Did you know about this?”\nKelek leaned forward in his judge’s seat. That was dangerously close to a\nstatement, which the audience was not allowed to make. Trial by witness\nallowed Adolin to make declarations, but the audience could only question.\n“I did not know of this event,” Adolin told the spren. “So I cannot offer\ninsight into why it happened, or what the circumstances were.”\n“How could you not know?” a different spren, in the second row,\ndemanded. “If you’ve come to persuade us to become Radiant spren,"

I think—”\n“Enough of that,” Kelek snapped. “Do you want to be ejected,\nVeratorim?”\nThe spren quieted immediately.\n“Proceed, human,” Kelek said, settling back and lacing his fingers before\nhimself.\n“My second argument,” Adolin said, “is to show to you that the\nkingdoms of the world have put aside their differences to unite together to\nface this challenge. I brought a letter from my cousin, Jasnah, which was\ntorn up. Fortunately, I can quote parts to you. She proves that the modern\nkingdoms are—”\n“Has she tried to kill her spren?” the spren in the first row asked.\n“She proves,” Adolin continued, “that our modern kingdoms are united\nin ways that—”\n“Yes, but has she tried to kill her spren?”\n“Look,” Adolin snapped, “do you want me to talk or not? Do you want\nto hear my testimony, like you’ve offered, or do you just want to take shots\nat me?”\nThe spren smiled. And Adolin realized what he’d done. By asking a\nquestion, Adolin had invited an answer.\n“I think,” the spren said, standing up, “that the most relevant question is\nif these new Radiants can be trusted. That’s what you need to prove. The\nStormfather told us that Dalinar Kholin forced him to physically manifest.\nDalinar Kholin, your father, using the Stormfather’s essence to work one of\nthe Oathgates!”\n“That’s against his oath!” another one exclaimed. “Did you know about\nyour father’s actions?”\n“I’m sure he had good reasons,” Adolin said. “If you would—”\n“Good reasons?” the standing honorspren said. “He was running away.\nDoes this seem like the kind of behavior we should trust in a Bondsmith?\nFrom the man you said was ideal, that you promised would never betray us.\nHow do you respond to this?”\nAdolin looked to Kelek. “Can I please continue my witness?”\n“You invited this discussion, son,” Kelek said. “You need to engage him\nnow.” Kelek nodded toward the crowd at the top of the forum. Those who\nhad joined with Notum yesterday waited quietly, wanting answers.\nAdolin sighed, glancing to Shallan for strength before continuing. “I\ncannot speak for my father. You’ll have to ask him. I trust him; the\nStormfather trusts him; that should be enough.”\n“He is a walking disaster,” the spren said. “He is a murderer by his own\ntestimony. This is no Bondsmith.”\nAdolin ignored that, as it wasn’t a question. And theoretically, he could\nlet this subject die and continue.\n“Jasnah’s letter,” he began, “is—”\n“Kaladin Stormblessed almost killed his spren too,” a completely\ndifferent honorspren said. “The Ancient Daughter, most precious of\nchildren.

Remember how you lied when you said I’d have a fair trial.\nRemember how you treated the man who came to you in good faith!”\nThe crowd fell silent.

Today she\nled a Cryptic—one with a broken pattern, the head wilted.\nDamnation. It was as he’d feared.\n“Do you know this Cryptic?” Amuna demanded from the steps.\n“If it’s the same one I saw when I first landed on these shores,” Adolin\nsaid, “then no. I just saw them once, in the market where the caravans\ncross.”\n“You know her story?”\n“I … Yes, I was told it by a shopkeeper.”\n“She was killed only a few years ago,” Amuna said. “This is proof of\nyour lies. Modern Radiants cannot be trusted.”\n“There is no evidence that a Radiant did this,” Adolin said. “We\nencountered humans—who have nothing to do with my people—who\nattacked Notum. Perhaps they attacked her.”\n“That kind of attack leaves a spren who can eventually be healed, with\nenough Stormlight,” Amuna said. “The only true death for a spren—the\nonly way to create a deadeye—is through broken Radiant oaths.” Amuna\ngestured toward the deadeye. “This Cryptic didn’t fall during the days of\nthe Recreance. She was killed less than a decade ago. By one of your\nRadiants.”\n“Likely someone new, untested,” Adolin said. “Someone we don’t know\nabout. Not one of ours; a poor new Radiant who didn’t understand what\nthey were doing. If you’d simply…”\nBut he knew he’d lost them. The crowds shifted, pulling away from the\nCryptic, scooting in their seats. Another spren from the first row stood up\nand shouted questions at Adolin, joined by a dozen others, their words\npiling atop one another. How many spren would have to die before he\nadmitted Radiants were a bad idea? Did he know the old Radiants had\nkilled their spren because they worried about something more dangerous?\nAdolin lowered his arms before the assault. Blended had tried to prepare\nhim as best she could, but Adolin was no expert in legal defenses. He’d let\nhimself be maneuvered, like being backed into unfavorable footing in a\nduel.\nThe reveal of the Cryptic overshadowed anything else he might say, any\nother arguments he could make. He looked to Kelek, who nodded, then\ngestured for him to go. Angry questions battered Adolin as he walked up the\nsteps with as much dignity as he could manage. He knew when a duel was\nrigged.

And\nstill he’d believed he could convince them.\nIdiot.\n* * *\nSome hours after Adolin’s second day of trial, Shallan closed her eyes,\nresting her head against his bare chest, listening to his heartbeat.\nShe would never have thought she’d find that sound so comforting. For\nmost of her life, she’d never considered what it would mean to be this close\nto someone. It would have been alien for her to imagine the blissful warmth\nof skin against skin, her safehand reaching alongside his face, fingers curled\ninto his hair. How could she possibly have anticipated the wonderful\nintimacy of feeling his breath on her hair, of listening to his heartbeat,\nlouder to her than her own. The rhythm of his life.\nLying there, everything seemed—for a moment—perfect.\nAdolin rested his arm across her bare back. The room was dark, their\ndrapes drawn closed. She wasn’t accustomed to darkness; usually you had a\nchip sitting out to give at least a little light. But here they had no spheres.\nExcept what she had hidden in the trunk. Sequestered with the cube that\nspoke between realms. And a very special knife.\n“I love you,” Adolin whispered in the dark. “What did I do to deserve\nyou?”\n“Blaspheme, perhaps,” she said. “Or play pranks on your brother. I’m\nnot sure what a person might do to make the Almighty curse them with me.\nPerhaps you were simply too slow to run away.”\nHe trailed his hand up her bare spine, making her shiver as he finally\nrested it on the back of her head. “You’re brilliant,” he whispered.\n“Determined. Funny.”\n“Sometimes.”\n“Sometimes,” he admitted, and she could hear the smile on his lips. “But\nalways beautiful.”\nHe thought that. He actually did. She tried to believe she deserved it, but\nit was difficult. She was so wrapped up in lies, she literally didn’t know\nwho she was anymore.\nWhat if he found out? What if he knew what she really was?\n“Your terrible taste in women,” Shallan whispered, “is one of the things I\nlove most about you.” She pressed her head to his chest again, feeling the\nblond hairs tickle her cheek. “And I do love you. That’s the only thing I’ve\nfigured out about my life.”\n“After today, I have to agree with you on this trial idea of mine. It was a\nterrible plan.”\n“I’d be the world’s biggest hypocrite if I couldn’t love you despite your\noccasional stupid idea.”\nHe rubbed the back of her head through her hair. “They’re going to\nimprison me,” he said. “They’re already building the cell. I will be a\nsymbol to them, a display for other spren to come and see.”\n“I’ll break you out,” Shallan said.\n“How?”\n“I stole some Stormlight,” she said. “I’ll grab my agents and Godeke,\nand we’ll stage a rescue. I doubt the honorspren will give chase; they’re too\nparanoid for that.”\nAdolin breathed out in the darkness."

I doubt the honorspren will give chase; they’re too\nparanoid for that.”\nAdolin breathed out in the darkness.\n“Not going to forbid me?” Shallan asked.\n“I … don’t know,” he said. “There are some here who want to listen to\nme, Shallan. Some I can persuade. But they’re afraid of dying, and I find\nmyself uncertain. Not everyone is suited to war, and that’s what I’m\nrecruiting them for. I can’t truthfully promise them they’ll live, that their\nRadiants won’t betray them. Maybe it’s not right to demand they join us.”\n“Kelek told you their leaders were considering going to the enemy’s\nside,” Shallan said. “If that happens, those spren will end up bonding people\nanyway, regardless of what they think now. And the people they’ll bond\naren’t the type to worry about the safety of their spren.”\n“True,” Adolin said. “Storms, I wish I could get through to everyone\nhere. Maybe tomorrow. I have a chance to rebut their witness, ask my own\nquestions.…”\n“Adolin? You said this is a terrible plan. Will the last day change that?”\n“Maybe not,” he said. “But at least it’s a terrible plan that lets me engage\nwith them. It lets them see a human trying to be honorable. Even if he’s\nterrible at it.”\n“You’re not terrible at being honorable.”\nHe grimaced. “Someone smarter could have won this,” he said softly.\n“Jasnah could have made them see. Instead it’s just me. I wish … I wish I\nknew, Shallan. What to do. How to make them see.”\nShe squeezed her eyes shut, attempting to return to that earlier moment\nof perfection. She couldn’t. There was too much pain in his voice. His\nheartbeat had sped up. His breathing no longer felt serene to her, but\nfrustrated.\nIt tore her apart to hear him like this. This was the man who had kept\nthem all together when Kholinar fell, the man who was normally so\noptimistic. He’d come here determined to prove to his father—and maybe\nto himself—that he was still valuable. This stupid trial was going to take\nthat from him.\nUnless.\nNo, Radiant thought. We can’t fulfill Mraize’s plan. He’s manipulating\nyou.\nWe do what two of us agree to, Shallan said. And I agree it is time to do\nas Mraize wants. We will take Kelek’s soul, and we will imitate him at the\ntrial. Veil and I will—\nNo, Veil thought.\nShallan’s breath caught. What?\nI change my mind, Veil said. I side with Radiant. I will not go kill Kelek.\nTwo against one, Shallan.\nSomething stirred deep inside of Shallan.\n“I…” Adolin whispered. “I wish I could find out who killed that poor\nCryptic. That’s what ruined it today. Ruined it all.”\nIt is time.\n“This trial is not ruined,” Formless said to Adolin. “You know, the more\nI contemplate it, the more I think maybe this trial wasn’t such a bad idea.\nYou’re right.

If you’re reading this and wondering what went wrong—\nwhy my soul evaporated soon after being claimed by the gemstone in\nyour knife—then I name you idiot for playing with powers you only\npresume to understand.\nTeft felt like a wet sack of socks that had been left out in a storm. The\nhonest-by-Kelek’s-own-breath truth was that he’d figured he’d done it\nagain. When he’d woken up naked and sickly, he’d assumed he’d gone back\nto the moss. In that moment, he’d hated himself.\nThen he’d seen Dabbid and Rlain. When he saw their joy—more heard it\nin Rlain’s case—Teft knew he couldn’t truly hate himself. This was where\nthe oaths had brought him. His self-loathing was, day by day, fading away.\nSometimes it surged again. But he was stronger than it was.\nThe others loved him. So, whatever he’d done, he would get up and\nmake it right. That was the oath he’d taken, and by the Almighty’s tenth\nname, he would keep it.\nFor them.\nThen he’d found out the truth. He hadn’t broken. He hadn’t taken up the\nmoss. It wasn’t his fault. For once in his storming excuse for a life, he had\nbeen kicked to the gutter and woken up with a headache—and it hadn’t\nbeen due to his own weakness.\nA few days of healing later, he still found it remarkable. His streak held\nstrong. Almost seven months with no moss. Damnation. He had an urge for\nsome moss now, honestly. It would take the edge off his pounding\nheadache.\nBut Damnation. Seven months. That was the longest he’d gone without\ntouching the stuff since … well, since joining the army. Thirty years.\nNever count those years, Teft, he told himself as Dabbid brought him\nsome soup. Count the ones you’ve been with friends.\nThe soup had some meat in it, finally. What did they think would happen\nif he ate something proper? He’d been out for a few days, not a few years.\nThat wasn’t enough time to turn into some kind of invalid.\nIn fact, he seemed to have weathered it better than Kaladin.\nStormblessed sat on the floor—refused to take the bench because it was\n“Teft’s.” Had a haunted look to him and was a little shrunken, like he’d\nbeen hollowed out with a spoon. Whatever he’d seen when suffering those\nfevers, it hadn’t done him any good.\nTeft had felt that way before. Right now he was mostly aches, but he’d\nfelt that way too.\n“And we were supposed to be off storming duty,” Teft grumbled, eating\nthe cold soup. “Civvies. This is how we end up? Fate can be a bastard, eh,\nKal?”"

Fate can be a bastard, eh,\nKal?”\n“I’m just glad to hear your voice,” Kaladin said, taking a bowl of soup\nfrom Dabbid. “Wish I could hear hers…”\nHis spren. He’d lost her somehow, in the fighting when he’d gotten\nwounded.\nTeft glanced to the side, to where Phendorana sat primly on the edge of\nhis bench. He’d needed to reach to summon her, and she said she didn’t\nremember anything that had happened since he went unconscious. She’d\nbeen … sort of unconscious herself.\nPhendorana manifested as an older human woman, with mature features\nand no-nonsense Thaylen-style clothing, a skirt and a blouse. Her hair blew\nfree as if in a phantom wind. Unlike Syl or some of the other honorspren,\nPhendorana preferred to manifest at the same size as a human.\nShe glanced at Teft, and he nodded toward Kaladin. Phendorana drew in\na breath and sighed pointedly. Then—judging by how Kaladin’s spoon\npaused halfway to his mouth—she let the others in the room see her.\n“Your Surgebinding still works?” Phendorana asked Kaladin.\n“Not as well as it did before the last fight,” Kaladin said. “But I can draw\nin Stormlight, stick things together.”\nIt was the same for Teft, but they’d found that if Lift didn’t show up and\ndo her little Regrowth thing to him every ten hours or so, he’d start to slip\nback into a coma. Something was definitely strange about that kid.\n“If you can Surgebind,” Phendorana said, “your bond is intact. The\nAncient Daughter might have lost herself through separation—it is difficult\nfor us to exist fully in this realm. However, I suspect she will stay close by\ninstinct. If you can get to where you lost her, you should be fine.”\n“Should be,” Kaladin said softly, then started eating again. He nodded in\nthanks as Dabbid brought him a drink.\nThey hadn’t pushed Dabbid too hard on the fact that he could talk. It\nwasn’t a lie, keeping quiet like he had. Not a betrayal. They each fought\ntheir own personal Voidbringers, and they each chose their own weapons.\nWhen it had come time to face the storm, Dabbid had done right by Teft and\nKaladin. That was what mattered. That was what it meant to be Bridge\nFour.\nA man could choose not to talk if he didn’t want to. Wasn’t no law\nagainst it. Teft knew a handful of people who should maybe try a similar\ntactic.\nThey continued eating in silence. After their initial joy at reuniting, their\nenthusiasm had dampened. Each thing Teft heard about their situation\nseemed worse than the one before. Fused in the tower. The queen captive.\nRadiants fallen. The tower spren slowly being corrupted, to the point that it\nwas almost dead. Kaladin couldn’t get it to talk to him anymore, and neither\ncould Dabbid.\nGrim days he’d awakened to. Almost wished they’d left him in a\nstorming coma. What good was he at fixing any of this?"

What good was he at fixing any of this?\nPhendorana glanced at him, sensing his emotions. He pointed his spoon\nat her and winked in thanks. No, he wasn’t going to be down on himself.\nHe’d sworn an Ideal.\nRegardless. Grim days. Grim storming days.\nThe door opened a short time later, and Rlain entered with Lift, who\nscuttled forward and sniffed at the pot of soup. She wrinkled her nose.\n“Be glad we have anything,” Kaladin said. “That ardent in the monastery\ndeserves credit. More than we gave him when we visited, Teft.”\n“Most people want to be helpful,” Teft said. “Even if they need a nudge\nnow and then. Kelek knows I do.”\nLift hopped up onto his bench and stepped around Phendorana, then\ntouched Teft, infusing him with Stormlight. He took a deep breath. And\nstorm him, the air felt a little warmer. At least now he wouldn’t fall asleep\nin his soup.\nRlain closed the door, then settled on the ground in the tight confines, his\nback to the stone wall, bits of his carapace scraping the stone.\n“No news from the queen,” Rlain said. “Lift managed to talk to one of\nthe scholars, and she says Navani has been isolated for over two weeks\nnow. She’s imprisoned, forced to sleep in the scholars’ rooms by herself.”\n“We’re all basically imprisoned,” Teft said. “Every storming one of us.”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “We five are free.”\n“So what do we do?” Rlain asked. “We don’t know where the last node\nis, the one keeping that shield up on the Sibling. If we did, it’s not like we\ncould protect it.”\nKaladin had told them, in disheartening detail, about how difficult it had\nbeen to get in and destroy the previous two. Protecting one against the\nentire might of Odium’s forces? Impossible. Teft agreed on that.\n“If we break this last one,” Teft said, “that’s it. Tower’s finished. But if\nwe wait, the Fused will find a way to break it themselves. Tower’s\nfinished.”\n“We can’t fight an entire army on our own,” Kaladin said. “Teft and I\nhave barely recovered, and our powers are temperamental at best. Two of us\nhave lost our spren.”\n“The girl can wake the other Radiants,” Teft said.\n“The other Radiants are guarded,” Kaladin said.\n“Guards can be distracted or dealt with,” Rlain said. “We did something\nsimilar to get Lift out. Venli is on our side. Or at least she’s not on the other\nside—and she’s Voice to the head Fused leading the occupation. We have\nresources.”\nKaladin tipped his head back, his eyes closed.\n“Lad?” Teft asked.\n“I don’t want any of you to take this the wrong way,” Kaladin said, not\nopening his eyes. “I’m not giving up. I’m not broken. No more than usual.\nBut I’m tired. Extremely tired. And I have to wonder. I have to ask myself."

What do we want to accomplish?”\n“We want to win,” Rlain said. “Free the tower. Restore the Radiants.”\n“And if we can’t plausibly do that?” Kaladin leaned his head forward\nand opened his eyes. They’d gone dark again, of course, now that he’d been\ndays without his Blade. The longer you kept your spren bonded, the more\nslowly the color faded. “I have to at least ask. Is it possible my father is\ncorrect? I’m starting to worry about what we might cause people to do if we\nkeep fighting.”\nThey grew quiet. And storm Teft if it wasn’t a valid question. One not\nenough soldiers asked themselves. Right here, right now, should I be\nfighting? Is there a better way?\nTeft took a spoonful of soup. “Did Sigzil ever explain to you boys how I\ngot my father killed?”\nThe other occupants of the room turned to stare at him with slack jaws.\nHe knew the rumors of what he’d done had moved through Bridge Four—\nand in the past he’d snapped at people who’d asked him about it. Storming\nfools.\n“What?” Teft said. “It happened a long time ago. I’m over it, mostly.\nAnd a man shouldn’t hide from what he’s done. Gotta air things like this.”\nHe dug into his soup, but found his appetite waning. He set the bowl aside,\nand Phendorana put her hand on his.\n“You were … young, weren’t you?” Kaladin asked, carefully.\n“I was eight when my father died,” Teft said. “But the problems all\nstarted far earlier. It was some travelers, I think, who introduced the idea to\nthe people of my hometown. Not quite a city. You might know it. Talinar?\nNo? Nice place. Smells like flowers. Least in my memory it does. Anyway,\nthe people of the town started meeting secretly. Talking about things they\nshouldn’t have. The return of the Lost Radiants.”\n“How do you think they knew?” Kaladin asked. “You gave me\nStormlight when I was dying, all the way back when I didn’t know what I\nwas doing. You recognized that it would heal me.”\n“Teft and I used to think,” Phendorana said, “that the group who visited\nTeft’s hometown—the Envisagers, they called themselves—were servants\nof some important lighteyes in Kholinar. Maybe they overheard what\npeople like Amaram were planning, and ran with it. Only…”\n“… Only that was forty-five years ago,” Teft said. “And when I asked\nBrightness Shallan about the group Amaram was part of, everything she’d\nfound indicated they’d started less than ten years ago. But that’s beside the\npoint. I mean, I only met the leaders once, when my parents brought me to\nthe initiation ceremony.”\nHe shivered, remembering.

The\nworst had been what they’d done to try to become Radiants. The things\nthey’d pushed their members to do. His mother had been one of those.…\n“It turned dark,” Teft said. “The things my people—my family—did …\nWell, I was around eight when I went to the citylord. I told him, thinking\nhe’d run the worst of the troublemakers out of town. I didn’t realize…”\n“What nahn was your family?” Kaladin asked.\n“Sixth,” Teft said. “Should have been high enough to avoid execution.\nMy mother was already dead by then, and my father…” He glanced up at\nthe rest of them, and felt their sympathy. Well, he didn’t want any storming\nsympathy. “Don’t look at me like that. It was a long time ago, like I said. I\neventually joined the military to get away from that town.\n“It haunted me for a long time. But ultimately, you know what? You\nknow Kelek’s own storming truth? Because of what my parents did and\ntaught me, I was able to save you, Kal. They won in the end. They were\nright in the end.” He picked up his soup and forced himself to begin eating\nit. “We can’t storming see the future, like Renarin can. We’ve gotta do what\nwe think is best, and be fine with that. It’s all a man can do.”\n“You think we should keep fighting?” Rlain said.\n“I think,” Teft said, “that we need to rescue those Radiants. Maybe we\ndon’t need to fight, but we’ve got to get them out. I don’t like the smell of\nwhat you’ve been telling me. Lined up like that, watched over? The enemy\nis planning something for our friends.”\n“I can wake them,” Lift said. “But they ain’t gonna be in fightin’ shape.\nAnd I’ll need a whole bunch of food. Like … an entire chull’s worth.”\n“If we can wake them,” Rlain said, “we don’t need to fight. We can have\nthem run. Escape.”\n“How?” Kaladin asked. “We can’t possibly hope to get all the way to the\nOathgates.”\n“There’s a window,” Rlain said. “In the infirmary room. We can break it\nmaybe, and escape out that way.”\n“To fall hundreds of feet,” Kaladin said.\n“That might take the Windrunners out of the influence of the tower,” Teft\nsaid with a grunt. He thought about dropping hundreds of feet, not knowing\nif his powers would reactivate before he hit bottom. “I’d try it, and prove it\ncan be done. The rest of you could watch and see if I fly up in the distance.\nIf I do, you could follow.”\nKaladin rubbed his forehead. “Assuming we could break the glass.\nAssuming we could get enough Stormlight to infuse the Windrunners.\nAssuming they’re strong enough, after being incapacitated for so long, to\ntry something that insane. Look, I like that we’re exploring ideas … but we\nneed to take time to consider all our options.”"

One thing a\ngood sergeant knew was when to let the officer be wrong. And Kaladin was\nan officer. He’d acted like one even when he’d been a slave. Like he’d been\nraised by a bunch of lighteyes or something. His official status or rank\ncouldn’t change what he was.\n“For now,” Kaladin said, “we wait. If we have to, we will break in and\nrescue the Radiants. But first we need to recover, we need to plan, and we\nneed to find a way to contact the queen. I’d like her input.”\n“I might be able to get in to see her,” Rlain said. “They have servants\ncart food and water to her and her scholars. Venli’s people are often\nassigned that detail, and I could hide my tattoo and substitute for one of\nthem.”\n“Good,” Kaladin said. “That would be great. And while we wait, we\ndon’t do anything too rash. Agreed?”\nThe others nodded, even Lift and Dabbid. Teft too, though this wasn’t\nthe sort of situation where you had luxuries like time to come up with the\nperfect plan. Teft determined he’d just have to be ready to act. Take that\nnext storming step. You couldn’t change the past, only the future.\nHe ate his soup as the conversation turned to lighter topics, and found\nhimself smiling. Smiling because they were still together. Smiling because\nhe’d made the right decision to stay in the tower when Kal needed him.\nSmiling because he had survived so long without moss or drink, and was\nable to wake up and see color to the world.\nSmiling because, for how bad everything could be, some things were\nstill good.\nHe shifted as Phendorana poked him. He looked over and caught her\ngrinning as well.\n“Fine,” he muttered. “You were storming right. You have always been\nright.”\nTeft was worth saving.\nThe bond is what keeps us alive. You sever that, and we will slowly\ndecompose into ordinary souls—with no valid Connection to the\nPhysical or Spiritual Realms. Capture one of us with your knives, and\nyou won’t be left with a spren in a jar, foolish ones. You’ll be left with a\nbeing that eventually fades away into the Beyond.\nVenli stood dutifully beside Raboniel, acting as her Voice as daily reports\nwere delivered. Mostly Venli was here to interpret. While Raboniel had\nlearned Alethi quite well—she claimed to have always been talented at\nlanguages—many of their current group of Regals spoke Azish, having\nbeen parshmen in that region.\nToday Raboniel took the reports while sitting on a throne at the mouth of\nthe hallway with the murals.

She had to be certain\nthose rhythms continued to punctuate her words, though lately they made\nher mouth feel coated in oil.\n“The Lady of Wishes hears your report,” Venli said to the current Regal,\nwho stood bowed before them. “And commends you on your Passion for\nthe search—but you are wrong, she says.

Her specially tailored Alethi-style dress\nfluttered as she walked, accentuating the lean, thin pieces of carapace armor\nalong her arms and chest.\nVenli followed; the Fused hadn’t indicated she should withdraw. Though\nRaboniel had a workstation and desk set up at the end of the hallway, she\nalways preferred to take reports out near the stairwell. It was as if Raboniel\nlived two separate lives here. The commander-general of the singer armies\nseemed so different from the scholar who cared nothing for the war. The\nsecond Raboniel was the truer one, Venli thought.\n“Last Listener,” Raboniel mused. “Last no more. Your people were the\nonly group of singers to successfully reject Fused rule and make their own\nkingdom.”\n“Were there … unsuccessful attempts?” Venli dared ask, to Craving.\n“Many,” Raboniel said. She hummed to Ridicule. “Do not make the\nsame mistake as the humans, assuming that the singers have always been of\none mind. Yes, forms change our thinking at times, but they merely enhance\nwhat’s inside. They bring out different aspects of our personalities.\n“Humans have always tried to claim that we are nothing but drones\ncontrolled by Odium. They like that lie because it makes them feel better\nabout killing us. I wonder if it assuaged their guilt on the day they stole the\nminds of those they enslaved.”\nRaboniel’s desk was nestled right up against the shield—which, once a\nbright blue, had grown dark and violet.\nRaboniel sat and began looking through her notes. “Do you regret what\nyou personally did, Last Listener?” she asked to Spite. “Do you hate\nyourself for your betrayal of your people?”\nTimbre pulsed. Venli should have lied.\nInstead she said, “Yes, Ancient One.”\n“That is well,” Raboniel said. “We all pay dearly for our choices, and the\npain lingers, when one is immortal. I suspect you still crave the chance to\nbecome a Fused. But I have found in you a second soul, a regretful soul."

Not because I admire one who regrets their\nservice—and you should know Odium does not look favorably upon\nsecond-guessing. Nevertheless, I had thought you to be like so many others.\nAbject in your cravings, ambitious to a fault.”\n“I was that femalen,” Venli whispered. “Once.”\nRaboniel glanced at her sharply, and Venli realized her mistake. She’d\nsaid it to the Lost. One of the old rhythms that Regals weren’t supposed to\nbe able to hear.\nRaboniel narrowed her eyes and hummed to Spite. “And what are you\nnow?”\n“Confused,” Venli said, also to Spite. “Ashamed. I used to know what I\nwanted, and it seemed so simple. And then…”\n“Then?”\n“They all died, Ancient One. People I … loved dearly, without realizing\nthe depth of my feelings. My sister. My once-mate. My mother. All just …\ngone. Because of me.”\nTimbre pulsed reassuringly. But Venli didn’t want reassurance or\nforgiveness at that moment.\n“I understand,” Raboniel said.\nVenli stepped closer, then knelt beside the table. “Why do we fight?” she\nasked to Craving. “Ancient One, if it costs so much, why fight? Why suffer\nso much to secure a land we will not be able to enjoy, because all those we\nlove will be gone?”\n“It is not for us that we fight,” Raboniel said. “It is not for our comfort\nthat we destroy, but for the comfort of those who come after. We sing\nrhythms of Pain so they may know rhythms of Peace.”\n“And will he ever let us sing to Peace?”\nRaboniel did not respond. She shuffled through a few papers on her\ntable. “You have served me well,” she said. “A little distractedly, perhaps. I\nascribe that to your true allegiance being to Leshwi, and your reports to her\ninterfering with your duties to me.”\n“I am sorry, Ancient One.”\nRaboniel hummed to Indifference. “I should have arranged for a regular\nmeeting for you to give her your spy reports. Maybe I could have written\nthem for you, to save time. At any rate, I cannot fault you for loyalty to\nher.”\n“She … doesn’t like you very much, Ancient One.”\n“She is afraid of me because she is shortsighted,” Raboniel said. “But\nLeshwi is among the best we have, for she has managed to not only\nremember why we fight, but to feel it. I am fond of Leshwi. She makes me\nthink that once we win, there will be some Fused who can rule effectively.\nEven if she is too softhearted for the brutalities we now must perpetuate.”\nRaboniel selected a paper off the desk and handed it to Venli. “Here.\nPayment for your services. My time in the tower runs short; I will finish\nunmaking the Sibling, and then will be on to other tasks. So I will now"

If you survive what comes next, there is a chance you may find\nsome peace of your own, Venli.”\nVenli took the paper, humming to Craving. “Ancient One,” she said, “I\nam a weak servant. Because I am so confused about what I want, I do not\ndeserve your praise.”\n“In part, this is true,” Raboniel said. “But I like confusion. Too often we\nbelittle it as a lesser Passion. But confusion leads a scholar to study further\nand push for secrets. No great discovery was ever made by a femalen or\nmalen who was confident they knew everything.\n“Confusion can mean you have realized your weaknesses. I forget its\nvalue sometimes. Yes, it can lead to paralysis, but also to truth and better\nPassions. We imagine that great people were always great, never\nquestioning. I think they would hum to Ridicule at that idea. Regardless,\ntake that gift and be off with you. I have much to do in the coming hours.”\nVenli nodded, scanning the paper as she rose. She expected a writ of\nauthority—given by Fused to favored servants, granting them extra\nprivileges or requisitions. Indeed, there was exactly that on the front. But on\nthe back was a hastily sketched map. What was this?\n“I had hoped to find good maps of the tower,” Raboniel noted to Fury.\n“But Navani had some burned, and disposed of the others—though she\nfeigns ignorance. This, however, is a report from a human scout who was\nflying along the eastern rim of the Shattered Plains.”\nUpon closer inspection, the page read in the human femalen writing\nsystem, it appears the group we assumed were Natan migrants are instead\nParshendi. A group of a few thousand, with a large number of children.\nVenli read it again.\n“Did some of your kind leave?” Raboniel asked absently. “Before the\ncoming of the Everstorm?”\n“Yes. Rebels who did not want the new forms, along with the children\nand the elderly. They … escaped into the chasms. Shortly before the storms\nmet, and the floodwaters came. They … they should have been completely\ndestroyed.…”\n“Should have. What a hateful phrase. It has caused me more grief than\nyou could know.” She began writing in one of her notebooks. “Perhaps it\nhas treated you with kindness.”\nVenli clutched the paper and ran, not giving Raboniel a proper farewell.\nI felt it happen to Jezrien. You think you captured him, but our god is\nSplintered, our Oathpact severed. He faded over the weeks, and is\ngone now. Beyond your touch at long last.\nI should welcome the same. I do not. I fear you.\nFormless awoke early on the day of Adolin’s final judgment. It was time.\nShe slipped from the bed and began dressing. Unfortunately, she’d moved a\nlittle too quickly, as Adolin stirred and yawned.\n“Veil’s clothing,” he noted.\nFormless didn’t respond, still dressing.\n“Thank you,” Adolin said, “for Shallan’s support last night.

I needed\nher.”\n“There are some things only she can do,” Formless said. Would that be a\nproblem, now that Shallan no longer existed?\n“What’s wrong, Veil?” Adolin said, sitting up in bed. “You seem\ndifferent.”\nFormless pulled on her coat. “Nothing’s different. I’m the same old\nVeil.”\nDon’t you use my name, Veil thought deep inside. Don’t you dare lie to\nhim like that.\nFormless stopped. She’d thought Veil locked away.\n“No,” Adolin said. “Something is different. Become Shallan for a\nmoment. I could use her optimism today.”\n“Shallan is too weak,” Formless said.\n“Is she?”\n“You know how troubled her emotions are. She suffers every day from a\ntraitorous mind.” She put on her hat.\n“I knew a one-armed swordsman once,” Adolin said, yawning. “He had\ntrouble in duels because he couldn’t hold a shield, or two-hand a sword.”\n“Obviously,” Formless said, turning and rummaging in her trunk.\n“But I tell you,” Adolin said, “no one could arm-wrestle like Dorolin. No\none.”\n“What is your point?”\n“Who do you think is stronger?” Adolin asked. “The man who has\nwalked easily his entire life, or the man with no legs? The man who must\npull himself by his arms?”\nShe didn’t reply, fiddling with the communication cube, then tucking\nMraize’s knife into her pocket along with her gemstone of Stormlight.\n“We don’t always see strength the right way,” Adolin said. “Like, who is\nthe better swimmer? The sailor who drowns—giving in at long last to the\ncurrent after hours of fighting—or the scribe who has never stepped into the\nwater?”\n“Do you have a point with these questions?” Formless snapped,\nslamming her trunk closed. “Because I don’t see one.”\n“I know. I’m sorry.” Adolin grimaced. “I’m not explaining it well. I\njust … I don’t think Shallan is as weak as you say. Weakness doesn’t make\nsomeone weak, you see. It’s the opposite.”\n“That is foolishness,” she said. “Return to sleep. Your trial is in a couple\nhours, and you shouldn’t be fatigued for it.”\nFormless stalked out into the living room. There she hid by the side of\nthe door and waited to see if Adolin followed. Pattern perked up from\nwhere he’d been sitting at the desk, and Formless quieted him with a glare.\nAdolin didn’t come out. She heard him sigh loudly, but he remained in\nbed.\nGood. She had to act quickly. Formless needed to give him this last gift,\nthe gift of winning here in Lasting Integrity. She owed the memory of\nShallan that much.\nI know what you’re doing, Veil whispered. I’ve finally figured it out.\nFormless froze. She checked on Radiant—tucked into the prison of her\nmind, trying to break free but unable to speak. So why could Veil?"

Formless sat at the desk and\nsketched the layout of the judge’s home. They’d paced it off yesterday, and\npeeked in windows. With her talent for spatial awareness, this floor plan\nshould be accurate.\nYou aren’t a new persona, Veil thought. If you were, you couldn’t draw\nlike that. You can lie to yourself, but not me.\nFormless froze again. Was this what she wanted? What she really\nwanted? She wasn’t sure of anything anymore.\nThere were so many questions. Why was Veil able to talk? Who had\nkilled Ialai? How would she extricate herself from Adolin, from the\nRadiants? Was that the life she desired?\nFormless steeled herself, quieting the questions. She placed a hand on\nher forehead, breathing deeply.\nPattern stepped over, so Formless closed the sketchbook and slid it into\nher satchel.\n“… Veil?” Pattern asked. “What are you doing?”\n“It has to happen today,” Formless said. She checked the clock. “Soon.\nBefore the judge leaves his quarters.” She gripped the gemstone she’d\nhidden in her pocket.\n“Veil,” Pattern said. “This is not a good idea.”\nHe is right, Veil thought. He is right, Shallan.\nI am Formless, she thought back.\nNo you’re not, Shallan.\n“I wouldn’t be so quick to tell me what is right and wrong, Pattern,”\nFormless said to him. “We still haven’t dealt with your betrayal and your\nlies. Perhaps you aren’t the best judge of morality, and should leave that to\nme.”\nHis pattern slowed and his shoulders slumped, and he stepped backward\nas if he wanted to vanish into the shadows.\nFormless drew out a little Stormlight, savoring the sensation of it inside\nher veins. Then she performed a Lightweaving.\nIt worked. Formless was a composite of the three—a single person with\nShallan’s drawing and Lightweaving abilities, Radiant’s determination and\nability to get things done, and Veil’s ability to push aside the pain. Veil’s\nability to see the truth.\nThe best of all three of them.\nLies, Shallan, Veil thought. Storms. I should have seen this. I should\nhave known.…\nShe glanced at herself in the mirror, and found the Lightweaving to be\nperfect. She looked exactly like Lusintia, the honorspren woman. She even\ngave off the same faint glow. This was going to be so easy.\nFormless packed her drawing tools in case she needed to quickly sketch\na new face. A Lightweaving disguised her satchel as a cloth bag like the\nones the honorspren used.\nBells from below announced that it was about an hour until the trial. She\ncrossed the room, passing Pattern, who had withdrawn to the corner. He\nstood in the shadows, his pattern moving lethargically.\n“What’s happening?” he said. “Something is very wrong with you,\nShallan. I have handled this so poorly.

I talked to Wit yesterday, and he—”\n“You’re still doing that?” Formless said. “You’re still disobeying me?”\nPattern pulled away further.\n“I’ve had enough of you,” Formless hissed. “Stay here and cover for me\nwith Adolin. We’ll talk about this at length after the trial.”\nShe took a deep breath and peeked out to make sure no one was\nwatching—they might wonder why Lusintia had been in Shallan’s house—\nthen slipped out and began crossing the southern plane. The fortress was\nquiet. Spren didn’t sleep, but they did have less active periods. They would\ncongregate at “night” in the homes of friends, leaving the walkways of the\nfortress relatively unwatched.\nA few leaves fluttered through the open air between the four sides.\nFormless tried not to look at the other three planes, three cities making an\nimpossible box around her. She wasn’t good at—\n“Veil,” a voice said behind her. “I need to explain. I must tell you the\ntruth. Mmm…”\nShe groaned and turned. Pattern was following her like a barely weaned\naxehound pup.\n“You’ll give away my disguise!” she snapped at him.\nHe stopped, his pattern slowing.\n“You must know what Wit said,” Pattern replied. “He is so wise. He\nseems to like you and hate everyone else. Ha ha. He made fun of me. It was\nvery funny. I am like a chicken. Ha ha.”\nFormless closed her eyes and sighed.\n“He said to tell you that we trust you,” Pattern said. “And love you. He\nsaid I should tell you that you deserve trust and love. And you do. I’m sorry\nI’ve been lying. For a very long time. I’m so sorry. I didn’t think you could\nhandle it.”\n“Shallan couldn’t,” she said. “Go to the room and wait. I’ll deal with you\nlater.”\nShe strode away, and fortunately he didn’t follow. It was time to become\nthe woman she’d been building toward ever since she left her home to steal\nfrom Jasnah. Formless could finally join the Ghostbloods. She didn’t care\nabout Shallan’s past. Let it sleep. She could be like Veil, who didn’t have to\nworry about such things.\nYou’re pretending to be like me, Veil thought. But Wit is right. You\ndeserve to be loved, Shallan. You do.\nThe High Judge’s quarters were all the way at the top of the plane, near\nthe battlements. It was difficult to ignore the strange geometry up here, past\nthe parks and the trees, because the sky was so close. She wanted to spend\ntime drawing it, but of course she wasn’t like that anymore. She needed to\nfind all this disorienting and strange. Like Veil.\nIt helped to focus on the target: a small building near the corner of the\nwall. She passed several honorspren, but not many.

Sneak in and make\nher way to the back room, which was the High Judge’s study. Knife him\nbefore he could react, then take his place for the trial.\nThis was her last step. This was the end.\nI … Radiant said, her voice distant. I killed Ialai.\nFormless froze in place.\nI saw … Radiant whispered, that you were about to do it. That you had\npoison secreted in your satchel. So I stepped in. To protect you. So you …\ndidn’t have to do it. To prevent … what is happening to you now …\nShallan …\nShe squeezed her eyes shut. No. No, she wouldn’t back down. She had\nto do this. To end it. To end the wavering.\nShe opened her eyes, strode up to the door, and grabbed the knob with\nher freehand. It vanished beneath her touch. Soulcasting really was easier\non this side. The knob barely cared that she asked it to change.\nShe pushed open the door. The room inside was packed. Pieces of\nfurniture stacked atop one another. Rolled tapestries. Knickknacks and\nmementos, like a small glass chicken on the windowsill and a pile of dusty\nletters on a table.\nFormless shut the door with a quiet motion. The windows provided\nenough light to see by, and she could see the glow of candlelight beneath\nthe room’s other door, the one that led into the High Judge’s study. Kelek\nwas here. She revealed Mraize’s knife, then stepped forward.\nAs she did so, she felt a coldness—like a sharp breeze. Stormlight left\nher in a rush. Formless paused, then glanced over her shoulder.\nVeil stood behind her.\n“I know why you’re doing this, Shallan,” Veil said. “There’s no fourth\npersona. Not yet. You’ve given yourself another name, so you can tuck\naway the pain. You take that step though, and it will be real.”\n“This is who I want to be,” Formless said. “Let me go.”\n“You’re running again,” Veil said. “You think you don’t deserve Adolin,\nor your place as a Radiant. You’re terrified that if your friends knew what\nyou truly were, they’d turn away from you. Leave you. So you’re going to\nleave them first.\n“That’s why you kept spending time with the Ghostbloods. That’s why\nyou’re here. You see this as an out from your life. You figure if you become\nthe despicable person the darkness whispers that you have been, then it will\nall be decided. No going back. Decision’s made.”\nFormless … Formless …\nWas just Shallan.\nAnd Shallan wanted to do this. She wanted to show them what she truly\nwas. So it would be over.\n“I can’t be Shallan,” she whispered. “Shallan is weak.”"

It is the man who must pull himself by his arms.\nAnd that swordsman with one arm … He was probably the best in raw skill.\nHe couldn’t win because of his disadvantages, but he wasn’t weaker than\nthe others.”\nShallan stilled.\n“Adolin is right,” Veil said. “He’s always been right about you.

And you are not weak.”\n“Aren’t I?” Shallan demanded, spinning. “I killed my own father! I\nstrangled him with my own hands!”\nThe words cut deep, like a spike through the heart. Veil winced visibly.\nBut that cut to the heart somehow let warmth bleed out, flowing through\nher. “You have borne that truth for a year and a half, Shallan,” Veil said,\nstepping forward. “You kept going. You were strong enough. You made the\noath.”\n“And Mother?” Shallan snapped. “Do you remember the feel of the\nBlade forming in our hands for the first time, Veil? I do. Do you remember\nthe horror I felt at the strike, which I never meant to make?”\nHer mother, with stark red hair—a length of metal in her chest as her\nbeautiful green eyes turned to coal. Burning out of her face. Shallan’s voice,\nscreaming at what she’d done. Screaming, begging to take it back. Wishing\nshe were dead. Wishing … Wishing …\nAnother spike to the heart. More warmth bleeding out, blood flowing\nwith thunderous heartbeats. Veil always felt so cold, but today she felt\nwarm. Warm with pain. Warm with life.\n“You can bear it,” Veil whispered.

For we had to carry it all these years.”\n“No,” Shallan said, her voice growing soft. “No. I can’t…”\n“You can,” Veil whispered. “I’ve protected you all these years, but it’s\ntime for me to leave. It’s time for me to be done.”\n“I can’t,” Shallan said. “I’m too weak!”\n“I don’t think you are. Take the memories.” Veil reached out her hand.\n“Take them back, Shallan.”\nShallan wavered.

Had Kelek heard\nthem talking … or … had they even spoken out loud?\nShallan surged to her feet. No. It hurt too much. Didn’t it make more\nsense to become what Mraize wanted? Adolin would hate her for what she\ndid. Dalinar would hate her. Shallan represented the very thing they all said\nthey would never do. The thing they blamed for all of their problems.

It painted the room before her, coloring it, changing it to a\nlush garden. Covered in bright green vines and shalebark of pink and red.\nWithin it, a hidden place where a girl cried. The girl wept, then\nscreamed, then said the terrible words.\n“I don’t want you! I hate you! I’m done! You never existed. You are\nnothing. And I am finished!”\nShallan didn’t turn away.

The color faded from her,\nbecoming pure white. Her memories integrated into Shallan’s. Her skills\nbecame Shallan’s. And Shallan recognized everything she had done.\nShe remembered preparing the needle hidden in her satchel to kill Ialai.\nShe saw her past, and her growing worry in all its self-destructive horror.\nSaw herself growing into the lie that she could never belong with Adolin\nand the Radiants, so she began searching for another escape.\nBut that escape wasn’t strength.

Thank you so much.”\nAnd then, like any other illusion that was no longer needed, Veil puffed\naway.\nShallan took a deep breath, her pain settling in. Storms … Pattern was\nhere. Not her new Pattern, the first one. The deadeye. Shallan needed to find\nher.\nLater. For now, she had a job to do. As she gathered herself, the door to\nthe study clicked open, and light spilled around a figure. An Alethi man\nwith wispy hair and weary eyes. Shallan knew that expression well.\n“I see,” Kelek said. “So you are the one sent to kill me?”\n“I was sent for that purpose,” she said, holding up the knife. She set it on\na nearby table. “Sent by someone who didn’t realize I’d be strong enough to\nsay no. You’re safe from me, Kelek.”\nHe walked over and picked up the knife in timid fingers. “So this is like\nthe one they used on Jezrien?”\n“I don’t know,” Shallan said honestly. “A group called the Ghostbloods\nwanted me to use that on you.”\n“Old Thaidakar has always wanted my secrets,” Kelek said. “I thought it\nwould be the man, your husband, who came for me. I wonder if he knows\nI’ve had trouble fighting these days. It’s so hard to decide. To do anything\nreally…”\n“Is that why you’ve been so hard on Adolin?” Shallan asked. “At the\ntrial?”\nKelek shook his head. “You two stumbled into a little war of ideologies.\nThe older honorspren—they’re so frightened of what happened to their"

But the young ones want to go fight.”\n“I can tell you about the people who sent me,” Shallan said. “We can\nshare information. But first I have a request. You’re about to convict my\nhusband in this sham of a trial. I’d like you to reconsider.”\nKelek wiped his brow with a handkerchief from his pocket. “So many\nquestions,” he said, as if he hadn’t heard her request. “Who else knows I’m\nhere? I feel like I’m close to finding a way offworld. Maybe … Maybe I\nshould wait.…”\n“I have information that could help you,” Shallan said. “But I want to\ntrade. There isn’t much time for us to—”\nShe was interrupted as the door slammed open, revealing several\nhonorspren—including Lusintia, the one Shallan had impersonated. She\ngestured aggressively at Shallan, who stepped back, reaching into her\npocket for her gemstone.\nIt was dun. Somehow, in what she’d done with Veil, she’d used it all up.\n“Attempting to influence the course of the trial?” Lusintia demanded.\n“Colluding with the judge?”\n“She was … doing nothing of the sort,” Kelek said, stepping up beside\nShallan. “She was bringing me news from the Physical Realm. And I’d\nhave you not barge into my quarters, thank you very much.”\nLusintia stopped, but then looked over her shoulder toward a bearded\nmale honorspren. Shallan recognized him as Sekeir, the one who had acted\nas prosecutor against Adolin on the first day of the trial. An important spren,\nperhaps the most important in the fortress. And one of the oldest ones.\n“I think, Honored One,” Sekeir said softly, “that you might be having\nanother bout of your weakness. We shall have to sequester you, I’m afraid.\nFor your own good…”\nNevertheless, I’m writing answers for you here, because something\nglimmers deep within me. A fragment of a memory of what I once was.\nI was there when Ba-Ado-Mishram was captured. I know the truth\nof the Radiants, the Recreance, and the Nahel spren.\nAdolin made no effort to arrive early to the last day of the trial. Indeed,\neach footstep felt leaden as he trudged toward the forum. He could see from\na distance that the place was crowded—with even more spren gathered at\nthe top of the steps than yesterday. Nearly every honorspren in the fortress\nhad come to watch him be judged.\nThough he didn’t relish facing them, he also couldn’t give up this\nopportunity. It was his last chance to speak for himself, for his people. He\nhad to believe that some of them were listening.\nAnd if he lost? If he was condemned to imprisonment? Would he let\nShallan rescue him, as she’d offered?\nIf I did, he thought, I would prove what the leaders of the honorspren\nhave been saying all along: Men aren’t worthy of trust. What if the only\nway to win here was to accept their judgment? To spend years in a cell?"

To spend years in a cell?\nAfter all, what else are you good for, Adolin? The world needed\nRadiants, not princes—particularly not ones who had refused the throne.\nPerhaps the best thing he could do for humanity was become a living\ntestimony of their honor.\nThat thought troubled him as he reached the crowd. They parted for him,\nnudging one another, falling silent as he descended.\nStorms, I wasn’t built for problems like this, Adolin thought. He hadn’t\nslept well—and he worried about the way Shallan had been acting lately.\nShe wasn’t sitting in her spot, and neither was Pattern. Was she going to\nskip this most important day of the trial?\nHe was about halfway down the steps when he noticed another oddity:\nKelek wasn’t there. Sekeir—the aged honorspren with the long beard—had\ntaken his place. He waved for Adolin to continue.\nAdolin reached the floor of the forum and walked over to the judge’s\nseat. “Where is Kelek?”\n“The Holy One is indisposed,” Sekeir said. “Your wife went to him in\nsecret and tried to influence the course of the trial.”\nAdolin felt a spike of joy. So that was what she’d been up to.\n“Do not smile,” Sekeir said. “We discovered a weapon of curious design,\nperhaps used to intimidate the Holy One. Your wife is being held, and the\nHoly One is … suffering from his long time as a Herald.\n“We have relieved him as High Judge, and I will sit in his place. You will\nfind the documentation on your seat, to be read to you if you wish. The trial\nwill continue under my direction. I am a far lesser being, but I will not be\nas … lax as he was.”\nGreat, Adolin thought. Wonderful. He tried to find a way to use this to\nhis advantage. Could he stall? Make some kind of plea? He looked at the\naudience and saw trouble, division. Perhaps he was a fool, but it seemed\nlike some of them wanted to listen. Wanted to believe him. Those felt fewer\nthan yesterday; so many others watched him with outright hostility.\nSo how could Adolin reach them?\nSekeir started the trial by calling for silence, something Kelek had never\nbothered to do. Apparently the hush that fell over the crowd wasn’t enough,\nfor Sekeir had three different spren ejected for whispering to one another.\nThat done, the overstuffed spren stood up and read off a prepared\nspeech. And storms, did it go on. Windy passages about how Adolin had\nbrought this upon himself, about how it was good that humans finally had a\nchance to pay for their sins.\n“Do we need this?” Adolin interrupted as Sekeir paused for effect. “We\nall know what you’re going to do. Be on with it.”\nThe new High Judge waved to the side. A spren stepped up beside\nAdolin, a white cloth in her hands. A gag. She pulled it tight between her\nhands, as if itching for a chance.\n“You may speak during the questioning of the witness,” Sekeir said.\n“The defendant is not allowed to interrupt the judge.”"

Adolin settled into parade rest. He didn’t have an enlisted man’s\nexperience with standing at attention, but Zahel had forced him to learn this\nstance anyway. He could hold it. Let them see him bear their lashes without\ncomplaint.\nHis determination in that regard lasted until Sekeir, at long last, finished\nhis speech and called for the final witness to be revealed.\nIt was Maya.\nAmuna led her by the hand, forcing back the watching honorspren.\nThough Adolin had gone to see Maya each morning—and they’d let him do\nhis exercises with her—bars had separated them. They hadn’t otherwise\nallowed him to interact with her, claiming deadeyes did best when it was\nquiet.\nIf so, why were they dragging her into the middle of a crowd? Adolin\nstepped forward, but the honorspren at his side snapped the gag in warning.\nHe forced himself back into parade rest and clenched his jaw. Maya didn’t\nseem any worse for the attention. She walked with that customary sightless\nstare, completely oblivious to the whispering crowd.\nSekeir didn’t hush them this time. The bearded honorspren smiled as he\nregarded the stir Amuna and Maya made. They placed Maya on her podium,\nand she turned and seemed to notice Adolin, for she cocked her head. Then,\nas if only now aware of it, she regarded the crowded audience. She shrank\ndown, hunching her shoulders, and glanced around with quick, jerky\nmotions.\nHe tried to catch her gaze and reassure her with a smile, but she was too\ndistracted. Damnation. Adolin hadn’t hated the honorspren, despite their\ntricks, but this started him seething. How dare they use Maya as part of\ntheir spectacle?\nNot all of them, he reminded himself, reading the mood of the crowd.\nSome sat quietly, others whispered. And more than a few near the top wore\nstormy expressions. No, they didn’t care for this move either.\n“You may speak now, prisoner,” Sekeir said to Adolin. “Do you\nrecognize this deadeye?”\n“Why are you questioning me?” Adolin said. “She is supposed to give\nwitness, and I’m supposed to question her. Yet you’ve chosen a witness who\ncannot answer your questions.”\n“I will guide this discussion,” Sekeir said. “As is my right as judge in the\ncase of a witness too young or otherwise incapable of a traditional\nexamination.”\nAdolin sought out Blended, a single black figure in a sea of glowing\nwhite ones. She nodded. This was legal. There were so many laws she\nhadn’t had time to explain—but it wasn’t her fault. He suspected he\ncouldn’t have understood every detail of the law even with years of\npreparation.\n“Now,” Sekeir said, “do you know this spren?”\n“You know I do,” Adolin snapped. “That is Mayalaran. She is my\nfriend.”\n“Your ‘friend,’ you say?” Sekeir asked. “And what does this friendship\nentail? Do you perhaps have dinner together? Participate in friendly chats\naround the campfire?”"

Participate in friendly chats\naround the campfire?”\n“We exercise together.”\n“Exercise?” Sekeir said, standing from his seat behind the judge’s table.\n“You made a weapon of her. She is not your friend, but a convenient tool. A\nweapon by which you slay other men. Your kind never asks permission of\nShardblades; you take them as prizes won in battle, then apply them as you\nwish. She is not your friend, Adolin Kholin. She is your slave.”\n“Yes,” Adolin admitted. He looked to Maya, then turned away. “Yes,\nstorm you. We didn’t know they were spren at first, but even now that we\ndo … we use them. We need to.”\n“Because you need to kill,” Sekeir said, walking up to Adolin. “Humans\nare monsters, with a lust for death that can never be sated. You thrive upon\nthe terrible emotions of the Unmade. You don’t fight Odium. You are\nOdium.”\n“Your point is made,” Adolin said more softly. “Let Maya go. Pass your\njudgment.”\nSekeir stepped up to him, meeting his eyes.\n“Look at her,” Adolin said, gesturing. “She’s terrified.”\nIndeed, Maya had shrunk down further and was twisting about, as if to\ntry to watch all the members of the audience at once. She turned so\nviolently, in fact, that Amuna and another honorspren stepped up to take her\narms, perhaps to prevent her from fleeing.\n“You want this to be easy, do you?” Sekeir asked Adolin, speaking in a\nsofter voice. “You don’t deserve easy. I had this fortress working in an\norderly, organized manner before you arrived. You have no idea the\nfrustration you have caused me, human.” The honorspren stepped away\nfrom Adolin and faced the crowd, thrusting his hand toward Maya.\n“Behold this spren!” Sekeir commanded. “See what was done to her by\nhumans. This Kholin asks us to offer ourselves for bonds again. He asks us\nto trust again. It is vital, then, that we examine carefully the results of our\nlast time trusting men!”\nMaya began to thrash, a low growl rising in her throat. She did not like\nbeing constrained.\n“This is a trial by witness!” Adolin shouted at Sekeir. “You are\ninterfering, and go too far.”\nBlended nodded, and other honorspren in the crowd had stood up at the\nobjection. They agreed. Whatever the law was, Sekeir was stretching it\nhere.\n“This witness,” Sekeir said, pointing at Maya again, “lost her voice\nbecause of what your people did. I must speak for her.”\n“She doesn’t want you to speak for her!” Adolin shouted. “She doesn’t\nwant to be here!”\nMaya continued to push against her captors, increasingly violent. Some\nof the crowd responded with jeers toward Adolin. Others muttered and\ngestured toward Maya.\n“Does it make you uncomfortable?” Sekeir demanded of Adolin."

That thrashing? It is the pain of someone who remembers\nwhat was done to her. She condemns you, Adolin Kholin.”\nMaya’s cries grew louder. Frantic, guttural, they weren’t proper shouts.\nThey were the pained anguish of someone who had forgotten how to speak,\nbut still needed to give voice to her agony.\n“This poor creature,” Sekeir shouted over the increasing din, “condemns\nyou with each groan. She is our final witness, for hers is the pain we must\nnever forget. Listen to her demand your punishment, Adolin Kholin! She\nwas innocent, and your kind murdered her. Listen to her cry for blood!”\nMaya’s shouts grew louder and more raw. Some honorspren in the crowd\npulled back, and others covered their ears, wincing. Adolin had heard that\nscream before, the time he’d tried to summon her as a Blade while in\nShadesmar.\n“She’s in pain!” Adolin shouted, lunging forward. The spren watching\nhim, however, had been waiting for this. They grabbed him and held him\ntight. “Let her go, you bastard! Your point is made!”\n“My point cannot be made strongly enough,” Sekeir shouted. “It must be\nrepeated over and over. You will not be the only traitor who comes with a\nsmile, begging to exploit us. My people must stay firm, must remember this\nmoment, for their own good. They need to see what humans did!”\nMaya’s voice grew louder, gasping breaths punctuated by ragged howls.\nAnd in that moment, Adolin … felt her pain somehow. A deep agony.\nAnd … anger?\nAnger at the honorspren.\n“They trusted you,” Sekeir said, “and you murdered them!”\nShe clawed at the hands, trying to free herself, her teeth flashing as she\ntwisted her scratched-out eyes one way, then the other. Yes, Adolin could\nfeel that agony as if it were his own. He didn’t know how, but he could.\n“Listen to her!” Sekeir said. “Accept her condemnation!”\n“LET HER GO!” Adolin shouted. He struggled, then went limp.\n“Storms. Just let her go.”\n“I refuse judgment!” Sekeir said. “I don’t need to give it. In the end, her\ntestimony is the only one needed. Her condemnation is all we ever needed.\nListen to her shouts; remember them as you rot, Adolin Kholin. Remember\nwhat your kind did to her. Her screams are your judgment!”\nMaya’s howls came to a crescendo of anguish, then she fell silent,\ngasping for breath. Weak. Too weak.\nTake it, Adolin thought to her. Take some of my strength.\nShe looked right at him, and despite her scratched-out eyes, she saw him.\nAdolin felt something, a warmth deep within him. Maya drew in air, filling\nher lungs.

Adolin braced himself for the screech. Her mouth\nopened.\nAnd she spoke.\n“We! CHOSE!”\nThe two words rang through the forum, silencing the agitated\nhonorspren. Sekeir, standing with his back to her, hesitated. He turned to\nsee who had interrupted his dramatic speech.\nPanting, hunched forward in the grip of her captors, Maya managed to\nrepeat her words. “We … We chose.…”\nSekeir stumbled away. The hands holding Adolin went slack as the\nhonorspren stared in shock.\nAdolin pulled free and crossed the stage. He shoved aside the startled\nAmuna and supported Maya, putting her arm across his shoulder to hold her\nup as he would a wounded soldier. She clung to him, stumbling as she\nstruggled to remain upright.\nEven as she did, however, she whispered it again. “We chose,” she said,\nher voice ragged as if she had been shouting for hours. “Adolin, we chose.”\n“Blood of my fathers…” Adolin whispered.\n“What is this?” Sekeir said. “What have you done to her? The sight of\nyou has caused her to rave in madness and—”\nHe cut off as Maya pointed at him and released a terrifying screech, her\njaw lowering farther than it should. Sekeir put his hand to his chest, eyes\nwide as her screech transformed into words.\n“You. Cannot. Have. My. SACRIFICE!” she shouted. “Mine. My\nsacrifice. Not yours.” She pointed at the crowd. “Not theirs.” She pointed at\nAdolin. “Not his. Mine. MY SACRIFICE.”\n“You knew what was going to happen when the Radiants broke their\noaths,” Adolin said. “They didn’t murder you. You decided together.”\nShe nodded vigorously.\n“All this time,” Adolin said, his voice louder—for the audience.\n“Everyone assumed you were victims. We didn’t accept that you were\npartners with the Radiants.”\n“We chose,” she hissed. Then, belting it loud as an anthem, “WE\nCHOSE.”\nAdolin helped her step over to the first row of benches, and the\nhonorspren sitting there scrambled out of the way. She sat, trembling, but\nher grip on his arm was fierce. He didn’t pull away; she seemed to need the\nreassurance.\nHe looked around at the crowd.

He\ndared them to ignore the testimony of the witness they’d chosen, the one\nthey’d pretended to give the power of judgment. He let them mull it over.\nHe let them think.\nThen they began to trail away. Haunted, perhaps confused, the\nhonorspren began to leave.

Until\neventually a single person remained in the stands. A female spren in a black\nsuit, her skin faintly tinged with an oily rainbow. Blended stood up, then\npicked her way down the steps.\n“I should like to take credit,” she said, “for your victory in what\neveryone assumed was an unwinnable trial. But it was not my tutelage, or\nyour boldness, that won this day.”\nMaya finally let go of Adolin’s arm. She seemed stronger than before,\nthough her eyes were still scratched out. He could feel her curiosity, her …\nawareness. She looked up at him and nodded.\nHe nodded back. “Thank you.”\n“Stren…” she whispered. “Stren. Be…”\n“Strength before weakness.”\nShe nodded again, then turned her scratched-out gaze toward the ground,\nexhausted.\n“I don’t intend to forget that you testified against me,” Adolin said to\nBlended. “You played both sides of this game.”\n“It was the best way for me to win,” she said, inspecting Maya. “But you\nshould know that I suggested to the honorspren elders that they use your\ndeadeye as a witness. They were unaware of the legal provision that\nallowed them to speak for her.”\n“Then her pain is your fault?” Adolin demanded.\n“I did not suggest they treat her with such callousness,” Blended said.\n“Their act is their own, as is their shame. But admittedly, I knew how they\nmight act. I wanted to know if a truth exists—the one you said to me.”\nAdolin frowned, trying to remember.\n“That she spoke,” Blended reminded him. “To you. That friendship\nexists between you. I sought proof, and found that her name—recorded in\nold documents of spren treaties—is as you said. A curious fact to find.\nIndeed.”\nBlended strolled around Adolin and studied Maya’s face. “Still scratched\nout…” she said. “Though a bond between you is.”\n“I’m … no Radiant,” Adolin said.\n“No. That is certain.” Maya met Blended’s gaze. “But something is\nhappening. I must leave this place at last and return to the inkspren. If the\nwords this deadeye spoke are…”\n“If what she said is true,” Adolin said, “then you have no further excuse\nfor refusing humankind the bonds they need.”\n“Don’t we?” Blended asked. “For centuries, my kind told ourselves an\neasy lie, yes. That humans had been selfish. That humans had murdered.\nBut easy answers often are, so we can be excused.\n“This truth, though, means a greater problem is. Thousands of spren\nchose death instead of letting the Radiants continue. Does this not worry\nyou more? They truly believed that—as humans claimed at the time—\nSurgebinding would destroy the world. That the solution was to end the\norders of Radiants. Suddenly, at the cost of many lives.”\n“Did you know the full cost, Maya?” Adolin asked, the question\nsuddenly occurring to him. “Did you and your Radiants know that you\nwould become deadeyes?”"

Eventually, she\nshook her head and whispered, “Pain. Yes. Death? No. Maybe.”\nAdolin sat beside her, letting her lean against him. “Why, Maya? Why\nwere you willing to do it?”\n“To save … save…” She sagged and shook her head.\n“To save us from something worse,” Adolin said, then looked to\nBlended. “What does it mean?”\n“It means we’ve had all of this terribly wrong for much time, Highprince\nAdolin,” she said. “And my own stupidity is. I have always thought myself\nsmart.” She shook her head as she stood before them, arms folded. “What\nan effective test. Very effective.”\n“This?” Adolin said, waving to the empty forum. “This was a complete\nand utter farce.”\n“I meant a different test,” Blended said. “The true trial—the one you’ve\nbeen engaging in for the last few years: the test for this spren’s loyalty. She\nwas the only judge who ever mattered, and today was her chance to offer\njudgment.” Blended leaned forward. “You passed.”\nWith that she turned to go and strode up the steps—her stark onyx\ncoloring making her seem a shadow with no accompanying body. “Easy\nanswers no longer are,” she said. “But if deadeyes can begin to return …\nthis is grand news. Important news. I will convey this to my people.\n“I do not know if making new Radiants is a good idea—but I must admit\nthat your ancestors were not traitors. Something did frighten them\nenormously, to cause humans and spren to destroy their bonds. And if the\nspren did not know they would die … then pieces of this puzzle are still\nmissing. The questions are more complicated, and more dangerous, than we\never knew.”\nWith that, Blended left. Adolin let Maya rest for a few minutes. When he\nfinally stood up, she joined him. She followed him as she normally did,\nexpressionless and mild, but he could feel that she was not as insensate as\nshe’d been. She was conserving energy.\nShe wasn’t healed, but she was better. And when he had needed her, she\nhad been willing to struggle through death itself to speak for him.\nNo, he thought. She spoke for herself. Don’t make the same mistake\nagain.\nHe needed to find Shallan and head to the Oathgate so they could share\nwhat he’d learned. Maybe the honorspren would swallow their pride and\nhelp. Maybe they would, as Blended said, find other reasons to fear.\nEither way, he suspected the Radiant relationship would never be the\nsame again.\nFOURTEEN MONTHS AGO\nVenli scrambled through a nightmare of her own making.\nBeneath a blackened sky, humans and listeners fought with steel and\nlightning.

The\nEverstorm was coming, building to a crescendo as the listeners called it.\nShe’d imagined this day as an organized effort by the listeners—led by\nher. Instead there was chaos, war, and death.\nShe did not join in the singing. She splashed through deep puddles,\nseeking to escape. The Weeping rains streamed down, soft but persistent.\nShe passed listeners she recognized, all standing in a line, their eyes\nglowing red as they sang.\n“Faridai,” she said to one of them. “We have to get away. The humans\nare sweeping in this direction.”\nHe glanced at her, but continued singing. The whole line seemed\ncompletely oblivious to the rain, and mostly oblivious to her words. She\nattuned Panic. They were overwhelmed by the new form, consumed by it.\nShe felt that same impulse, but was able to resist. Perhaps because of her\nlong association with Ulim? She wasn’t certain. Venli hurried away, looking\nover her shoulder. She couldn’t make out much of what was happening on\nthe battlefield. It stretched across multiple plateaus, veiled in mist and rain,\nshadowed by pitch-black clouds. Occasional bursts of red lightning showed\nthat many of the new stormforms were fighting.\nHopefully they could control their powers better than Venli could. When\nshe had released the energy of stormform—expecting grand attacks that\nsmote her foes—the lightning had gone in wild directions, unpredictable.\nShe didn’t think she had hurt a single human, and now she felt limp, the\nglorious energy expended—and slow to renew.\nShe hid by a large lump of rock that might have been a building long\nago. Behind her, humans attacked the line of listeners she’d left; she heard\nscreams, felt a crack as lightning was released.\nTheir song did not start again, but she heard humans cursing and talking\nin their crude tongue, voices echoing over the sound of the rain. More dead.\nThe storm was building, yes—nearly upon them. But how many listeners\nwould be slaughtered before it arrived?\nSurely the other battlefronts are doing better, she thought, squeezing her\neyes closed and listening to the Rhythm of Panic. Surely the listeners are\nwinning.\nWhat of Ulim’s promises? What of Venli’s throne? She breathed in cold\nair, water streaming along the sides of her face, leaving her skin numb and\nher carapace chilled. She pressed against the rocks, trembling. It was all\nwrong. She wasn’t supposed to be here. She was supposed to be safe.\nThe sound of boots scraping stone made her open her eyes in time to see\na spear coming at her. She lunged to the side, but the weapon struck across\nthe ridges on her cheek and nose, cutting only a thin slice in her skin—\nmostly deflecting off the carapace mask stormform had given her face.\nShe fell to the ground in a puddle and tried to pull away, one hand out\nand pleading. The human loomed over her, a terrible figure with his features\ncompletely lost in the shadow of his helm. He raised his spear.\n“No, no,” Venli said to Subservience in his language. “Please, no. I’m\nscholar. No weapon. Please, no.”"

Please, no.”\nHe brandished his spear, but as she cringed—turning aside her face—no\nblow came. The man stepped away, then jogged off, joining some of his\nfellows who were forming up against an approaching group with glowing\nred eyes.\nVenli felt at the scrape the spear had caused, amazed at how little it had\nwounded her. Then she felt at her skin, her clothing. He’d … he’d just left\nher alone. As she’d asked. She stared after the man, attuning Derision. The\nfool didn’t know how important a listener he’d spared. He should have\nkilled her.\nDerision seemed to fade though, as she considered. Was … was that the\nproper rhythm, the proper feeling, she should feel upon being saved? What\nhad happened to her these last few years? What had she let happen to her?\nFor a moment she heard the Rhythm of Appreciation instead. Part of her,\nit seemed, didn’t want to bask in the glory of the new form. Part of her\nlonged for the comforts of the familiar. When she’d been weak.\nAnd this is strength? she thought as she picked herself up off the ground,\nlistening to the thunder.\nThe new storm was approaching. It would save them, exterminating the\nhumans and elevating the listeners who survived. She simply had to make\ncertain she was one of them. She scurried away to search out a stronger\ngroup of listeners to protect her. She entered an open section of plateau,\nslick with water, near one of the chasms.\nBands of humans and listeners roamed along the edge of the chasm here,\ntrying to get an upper hand against one another. If anything, the fighting in\nthis area was more horrifying. She forcibly attuned Conceit and moved\nalong the perimeter. Conceit. A good rhythm, a counterpart to\nDetermination or Confidence—only grander. Conceit was a proud, strong\nrhythm with a surging fanfare of quick, complex, and bold beats.\nThat was how she needed to feel. This was her battlefield. She’d crafted\nthis, she’d brought it all together. There was nothing to fear here. This was\nher victory celebration.\nShe passed one of the humans’ dead horses, a Ryshadium by the size. It\nhad been killed by lightning, so at least some of her people were capable of\ncontrolling their new abilities. Ahead—illuminated by scattered light\nthrough a patch of clouds—she saw two brilliant figures fighting along the\nedge of the chasm. Shardbearers.\nVenli didn’t know the human, but the listener was Eshonai. She was the\nlast of their Shardbearers. The Plate was distinctive, even if the new form\nhad … changed her. It was hard to associate the terrible warlord Eshonai\nhad become with the thoughtful femalen who had tried so hard to find a\nway out of the war.\nVenli stopped beside a broken spire of rock and hunkered down,\nwatching through the rain as the two clashed.

Eshonai—particularly the\nenhanced Eshonai—could handle a duel on her own. Venli would just be in\nthe way.\nShe was able to tell herself this, and believe it, right up until Eshonai was\nshoved off the rim of the chasm. One moment she was holding her own\nagainst the human. The next she was gone. Plunged into the abyss.\nVenli watched her go with a feeling of disconnect. In Shardplate,\nEshonai could survive that fall. Probably. Venli was the one in danger, with\nthe human Shardbearer nearby. The new rhythms thrummed through her,\nwhispering of power. Heightening her emotions. She was herself, not overly\ninfluenced by the form. In control. Not a slave.\nYet she felt … nothing. For a form that seemed so vibrant with emotions,\nthat was wrong. Could the old Venli have watched her sister take a\npotentially deadly fall without so much as a sorrowful rhythm? Strange.\nWhy no concern? What was happening to her?\nVenli withdrew. She … she’d go find Eshonai later. Help get her out of\nthe chasm. They could attune Amusement together as they thought of Venli\n—a simple scholar—doing anything to help in a fight between two\nShardbearers.\nThe battlefield decayed further as Venli sought refuge. Screams.\nLightning blasts. She saw in it something more terrible than just a clash\nover the future of their peoples. She saw something that enjoyed the killing.\nA force that seemed to be growing with the new storm, a force that loved\npassion, anger—any emotion, but especially those that came when people\nstruggled.\nEmotion was never stronger than when someone died. This force sought\nit, craved it. Venli felt its presence like a building miasma, more oppressive\nthan the rainclouds or the storm. She crept among some large rock\nformations. Lumps that had been buildings, now blanketed by thick crem.\nShe wasn’t certain where she was in relation to the center of Narak.\nFortunately, she found a narrow fissure between the ancient buildings.\nShe squeezed in, wet and overwhelmed by the building sensation.\nSomething was coming, something incredible. Something terrible.\nThe new storm was here.\nVenli allowed herself to attune the rhythm of her true emotions—the\nwild, frenetic beat of the Rhythm of Panic. A more virulent version of the\nRhythm of the Terrors. Everything went black, the last few hints of sunlight\nconsumed by the weight of this new storm. Then, red lightning. It electrified\nthe sky, and Venli crouched. No. She was still too exposed.\nShe knew with a sudden, inexplicable confidence that if the storm saw\nher, it would destroy her.\nBetween bolts of lightning, she pushed out of the cavity of rock and felt\nher way along the side of the stone building. The winds began to howl.\nSomething else … something else was coming. A highstorm too?\nPanic almost overwhelmed her. Then—to her incredible relief—her\nfingers felt something. A hole cut into one of the crem-covered buildings."

        "text": "Something else … something else was coming. A highstorm too?\nPanic almost overwhelmed her. Then—to her incredible relief—her\nfingers felt something. A hole cut into one of the crem-covered buildings.\nThis was fresh, the cuts unnaturally smooth; a Shardbearer had been here.\nShe eagerly sought refuge inside, trying to banish the Rhythm of Panic,\nreplace it with something else. Outside, the winds began to clash. She\npressed against the rear wall of the small empty chamber, lit by the\nincreasingly violent flashes of light outside. First red. Then white. Then the\ntwo tangled like fighting greatshells, crushing the land around them as they\ngrappled.\nDebris began to whip past the opening, lit by the rapid flashes, and the\nrhythms in her head went crazy. Breaking apart, movements of one melding\nwith another. The ground trembled and groaned, and Venli sought to hide\ndeeper in the building, away from the violence. As she passed a doorway,\nhowever, the floor undulated and she was cast to the ground.\nWith a sound so loud her whole body vibrated, an entire section of the\nstone building was ripped free—including the room she’d just left.\nShe was pelted by rain, exposed to the howling winds through the\nbroken wall. This was the end. The end of the world. Tiny, terrified, she\npressed herself between two solid-seeming chunks of rock and closed her\neyes, unable to hear the rhythms over the sound of the tempest.\nShe knew what rhythm she’d hear if she could, though. For there,\npressed between stones, Venli was forced to admit what she really was. The\ntruth that had always been there, covered over, encrusted with crem.\nExposed only when the winds cut her to her soul.\nShe was no genius forging a new path for her people. Everything she’d\n“discovered” had been given or hinted at by Ulim.\nShe was no queen deserving of rule. She cared nothing for her people.\nJust for her own self.\nShe wasn’t powerful. The winds and the storms reminded her that no\nmatter what she did—no matter how hard she tried, no matter how much\nshe pretended—she would always be small.\nShe had pretended she was those things, and would likely pretend them\nagain as soon as she could lie to herself. As soon as she was safe. But here\n—with everything else flayed away and her soul stripped bare—Venli was\nforced to admit what she truly was. What she’d always been.\nA coward.\nI tell you; I write it. You must release the captive Unmade. She will not\nfade as I will. If you leave her as she is, she will remain imprisoned for\neternity.\nRlain found her crying.\nVenli could count on her fingers the number of times she could\nremember crying. Not merely attuning Mourning, but actually crying.\nToday she couldn’t help herself. She knelt in the sectioned-off part of the\ninfirmary room, overlooking the large map of the Shattered Plains that Rlain\nhad stolen. She was alone. Lirin and Hesina were in the main room, seeing\nto the patients.\nA note on the map hinted at what Raboniel had said: a group of nomads\nin the hills. Her people. They had survived."

They had survived.\nShe turned to Rlain, who—shocked—was humming to Awe at finding\nher like this.\n“We’re not the last,” Venli whispered. “They are alive, Rlain. Thousands\nof them.”\n“Who?” He knelt. “What are you talking about?”\nVenli wiped her eyes—she wouldn’t have her tears destroying this\nglorious map. Venli handed him the note Raboniel had given her, but of\ncourse he couldn’t read. So she read it out loud for him.\n“You mean…” he said, attuning Awe. “Thousands of them?”\n“It was Thude,” Venli said. “He refused stormform. So did most of\nEshonai’s closest friends. I … I wasn’t thinking back then.… I would have\nhad them killed, but Eshonai separated them off and let them escape. Part of\nher fought, so she gave them a chance, and … And then…”\nStorms, she was a mess. She wiped her eyes again.\n“You would have had them killed?” Rlain asked. “Venli, I don’t\nunderstand. What is it you’re not telling me?”\n“Everything,” she whispered to Pleading. “A thousand lies, Rlain.”\n“Venli,” he said, taking her hand. “Kaladin is awake. Teft is too. We have\na plan. The start of one, at least. I came to explain it to Lirin and Hesina.\nWe’re going to try to wake the Radiants, but we need to get those\nstormforms out of the room. If you know something that might help, now\nwould be a good time to talk.”\n“Help?” Venli whispered. “Nothing I do helps. It only hurts.”\nRlain hummed to Confusion. At a gentle prompting from Timbre, Venli\nstarted talking. She began with the strange human woman who had given\nher the sphere, and went all the way up to when Thude and the others left.\nShe didn’t hide her part in it. She didn’t coat it with the Rhythm of\nConsolation. She gave it to him raw. The whole terrible story.\nAs she spoke, he pulled farther and farther away from her. His\nexpression changed, his eyes widening, his rhythms moving from shocked\nto angry. As she might have expected. As she wanted.\nWhen she finished, they sat in silence.\n“You are a monster,” he finally said. “You did this. You are responsible.”\nShe hummed to Consolation.\n“I suppose the enemy would have found another way,” he said, “without\nyour help. Regardless, Venli. You … I mean…”\n“I need to find them,” she said, rolling up the map. “There are daily\ntransfers to Kholinar. Raboniel has released me from my duties here, and\ngiven me a writ allowing me to requisition whatever I need. I should be able\nto procure a spot in the next transfer, and from there go with some Heavenly\nOnes on a scouting mission out to the Shattered Plains.”\n“And in so doing, you’d lead the enemy directly to our people,” Rlain\nsaid. “Venli, Raboniel obviously wants you to do this.

You’re playing into whatever plot she has.”\nShe’d considered that. She wasn’t exactly in the most rational state of\nmind, however. “I have to do something, Rlain,” she whispered. “I need to\nsee them with my own eyes, even if I have to walk there.”\n“I agree, we should do that as soon as it’s reasonable,” Rlain said. He\nglanced toward the curtains, then spoke more quietly. “But now isn’t the\ntime. We have to save the Radiants.”\n“Do you really want me there when you do, Rlain? Do you want me\naround?”\nHe fell silent, then hummed to Betrayal.\n“Smart,” she said.\n“I don’t want you around right now, Venli,” he said. “But storm me, we\nneed you. And I think you’re trustworthy. You told me this, after all. And\nwho knows how much of what you did was influenced by your forms or\nthose Voidspren?\n“For now, let’s work on saving the Radiants. If you’re truly sorry for\nwhat you did, then this is the best way to prove it. After that, we can seek\nout our people without leading the Fused to them.”\nShe looked away, then hummed to Betrayal herself. “No. This isn’t my\nfight, Rlain. It never was. I have to go see if this map is true. I have to.”\n“Fine,” he snapped. He stood to leave, then paused. “You know, all those\nmonths running bridges—then training with Kal and the others—I\nwondered. I wondered deep down if I was a traitor. I now realize I didn’t\nhave the first notes of understanding what it meant to be a traitor.”\nHe ducked out between the curtains. Venli quietly tucked the map of the\nShattered Plains into its case, then put it under her arm. It was time for her\nto go.\nShe found both Dul and Mazish caring for the fallen Radiants. Venli\npulled them aside, and whispered, “The time has come. Are we ready to\nleave?”\n“Finally,” Dul said to Excitement. “We’ve siphoned away rations,\ncanteens of water, blankets, and some extra clothing from what we were\ngiven to care for the Radiants. Harel has it all ready in packs, hidden among\nthe other supplies in the storage room we were given.”\n“The people are ready,” Mazish said. “Eager. We think we can survive in\nthe cold up here for months.”\n“We’ll need those supplies,” Venli said, “but we might not have to\nsurvive in the mountains. Look.” She showed them the writ of authority\nRaboniel had given her. “With this, we can get through the Oathgates, no\nquestions asked.”\n“Maybe,” Dul said to Appreciation. “So we go to Kholinar, but then\nwhat?

We’re back where we began.”\n“We take the supplies, and we use this writ to leave the city,” Venli\nexplained. “We hike out to the east and disappear into the wilderness to the\neast of Alethkar, like my ancestors did so many generations ago.”\nThen we make our way to the Shattered Plains, she thought. But … that\nwould take too long. Could Venli find a way to scout ahead, using the aid of\nthe Heavenly Ones? Perhaps get dropped off nearer the Unclaimed Hills,\nwithout revealing what she was truly seeking?\nIt seemed a lot to demand of this one writ. Plus, Raboniel knew about the\nlisteners who had survived. Surely she’d eventually tell the other Fused.\nFor the moment, Venli didn’t care. “Gather the others,” she whispered.\n“The humans are going to attempt to rescue the Radiants here soon. The\nchaos should cover our escape. I want us to leave in the next day or two.”\nThe other two attuned Resolve; they trusted her. More than she trusted\nherself. Venli doubted she would find redemption among the listeners who\nhad escaped the Fused. In fact, she expected accusation, condemnation.\nBut … Venli had to try to reach them. For when they’d escaped, they’d\ntaken her mother with them. Jaxlim might be dead—and if not, her mind\nwould still be lost to age.\nBut she was also the last person—the only person—who might still love\nVenli, despite it all.\nAs one who has suffered for so many centuries … as one whom it\nbroke … please find Mishram and release her. Not just for her own\ngood. For the good of all spren.\nFor I believe that in confining her, we have caused a greater wound\nto Roshar than any ever realized.\nNavani entered a feverish kind of study—a frantic near madness—as the\nwork consumed her. Before, she had organized. Now she merely fed the\nbeast. She barely slept.\nThe answer was here. The answer meant something. She couldn’t\nexplain why, but she needed this secret.\nFood became a distraction. Time stopped mattering. She put her clocks\naway so they wouldn’t remind her of human constructs like minutes and\nhours. She was searching for something deeper. More important.\nThese actions horrified a part of her. She was still herself, the type of\nwoman who put her socks in the drawer so they all faced the same\ndirection. She loved patterns, she loved order. But in this quest for meaning,\nshe found she could appreciate something else entirely. The raw,\ndisorganized chaos of a brain making connections paired with the single-\nminded order of a quest for one all-consuming answer.\nCould she find the opposite to Voidlight?\nStormlight and Voidlight had their own kind of polarity. They were\nattracted to tones like iron shavings to a magnet. Therefore, she needed a\ntone that would push light away. She needed an opposite sound.\nShe wanted fluid tones, so she had a slide whistle delivered, along with a\nbrass horn with a movable tube. However, she liked the sound of the plates\nbest.

They were difficult to increment, but she could order new ones cut and\ncrafted quickly.\nHer study morphed from music theory—where some philosophers said\nthat the true opposite of sound was silence—to mathematics. Mathematics\ntaught that there were numbers associated with tones—frequencies,\nwavelengths.\nMusic, at its most fundamental level, was math.\nShe played the tone that represented the sound of Voidlight again and\nagain, embedding it into her mind. She dreamed it when she slept. She\nplayed it first thing when she arose, watching the patterns of sand it made\non a metal plate. Dancing grains, bouncing up and down, settling into peaks\nand troughs.\nThe opposite of most numbers was a negative number. Could a tone be\nnegative? Could there be a negative wavelength? Many such ideas couldn’t\nexist in the real world, like negative numbers were an artificial construct.\nBut those peaks and troughs … could she make a tone that produced the\nopposite pattern? Peaks where there were troughs, troughs where there\nwere peaks?\nDuring her feverish study into sound theory, she discovered the answer\nto this. A wave could be negated, its opposite created and presented in a\nway that nullified the original. Canceling it out. They called it destructive\ninterference. Strangely, the theories said that a sound and its opposite\nsounded exactly the same.\nThis stumped her. She played the plates she’d created, indulging in their\nresonant tones. She put Voidlight spheres into her arm sheath and listened\nuntil she could hum that tone. She was delighted when—after hours of\nconcerted practice—she could draw Voidlight out with a touch, like the\nFused could do.\nHumans could sing the correct tones. Humans could hear the music of\nRoshar. Her ancestors might have been aliens to this world, but she was its\nchild.\nThat didn’t solve the question though. If a tone and its destructive\ninterference sounded the same, how could she sing one and not the other?\nShe played the tone on a plate, humming along. She next played a tuning\nfork, listened to the tones of the gemstones, then came back to the plate. It\nwas wrong. Barely off. Even though the tones matched.\nShe asked for, and was given, a file. She tried to measure the notes the\nplate made, but eventually had to rely on her own ear. She worked on the\nplate, filing off small sections of the metal and then pulling the bow across\nit, getting the plate closer and closer.\nShe could hear the tone she wanted, she thought. Or was it madness?\nThis desire to create an anti-sound?\nIt took hours. Maybe days. When it finally happened, she knelt bleary-\neyed on the stone floor at some unholy hour. Holding a bow, testing her\nnewest version of the plate. When she played this particular tone—bow on\nsteel—something happened. Voidlight was shoved out of the sphere\nattached to the plate. It was pushed away from the source of the sound.\nShe tested it again, then a third time to be sure. Though she should have\nwanted to shout for joy, she simply sat there staring. She ran her hand\nthrough her hair, which she hadn’t put up today. Then she laughed.\nIt worked.\n* * *\nThe next day—washed and feeling slightly less insane—Navani"

She tested how loud the tone needed to be to produce the\ndesired effect. She measured the tone on different sizes of gemstones and\non a stream of Voidlight leaving a sphere to flow toward a tuning fork.\nShe did all of this in a way that—best she could—hid what she was\ndoing from her watching guard. Hunched over her workspace, she was\nrelatively certain the Regal there wouldn’t be able to tell she’d made a\nbreakthrough. The one last night hadn’t watched keenly; he’d been dozing\nthrough much of it.\nConfident that her tone worked, she began training herself to hum the\ntone the plate made. It did sound the same, but somehow it wasn’t the same.\nAs when measuring spren—which reacted to your thoughts about them—\nthis tone needed Intent to be created. You had to know what you were trying\nto do.\nIncredibly, it mattered that she wanted to hum the opposite tone to\nOdium’s song. It sounded crazy, but it worked. It was repeatable and\nquantifiable. Inside the madness of these last few days, science still worked.\nShe had found Voidlight’s opposite tone. But how could she create Light\nthat expressed this tone? For answers, she looked to nature. A magnet could\nbe made to change its polarity with some captive lightning, and another\nmagnet could realign the pole. But Raboniel had mentioned they could\nmagnetize an ordinary piece of metal that way too.\nSo were they really changing the polarity of the magnet? Or were they\nblanking the existing polarity—then rewriting it with something new? The\nidea intrigued her, and she made a few key requests of her jailers—some\nobjects that would have to be fetched from one of the labs near the top of\nthe tower.\nSoon after, Raboniel came to check on her. Navani braced herself. She’d\nbeen planning for this.\n“Navani?” the Fused asked. “This latest request is quite odd. I don’t\nknow what to make of it.”\n“It’s just some esoteric lab equipment,” Navani said from the desk.\n“Nothing of any real note, though it would be fun to use in some\nexperiments. No bother if you can’t find it.”\n“I authorized the request,” Raboniel said. “If it is there, you shall have\nit.”\nThat was a rhythm to express curiosity. She made a note in her book; she\nwas trying to list them all.\n“What are you working on?” Raboniel asked. “The guard tells me of a\nterrible sound you have been making, something discordant.”\nDamnation. The new tone didn’t sound the same to a Regal. Could she\nexplain it away? “I’m testing how atonal sounds influence Voidlight, if at\nall.”\nRaboniel lingered, looking over Navani’s shoulder. Then she glanced at\nthe floor, where a bucket of icy water, with snow from outside, held a\nsubmerged gemstone. It was an attempt to see if temperature could blank\nthe tone of Voidlight.\n“What are you not telling me?” Raboniel said to a musing rhythm. “I"

It was an attempt to see if temperature could blank\nthe tone of Voidlight.\n“What are you not telling me?” Raboniel said to a musing rhythm. “I\nfind your behavior … intriguing.” She glanced to the side as her daughter\ntrailed into the room.\nThe younger Fused was drooling today. Raboniel had a servant\nperiodically put a cloth against the side of her daughter’s mouth. It wasn’t\nthat her face was paralyzed; more that she didn’t seem to notice or care that\nshe was drooling.\n“You write about something called ‘axi’ in our notebook,” Navani said,\ntrying to distract Raboniel. “What are these?”\n“An axon is the smallest division of matter,” Raboniel said. “Odium can\nsee them. Theoretically, with a microscope powerful enough, we could see\nlittle balls of matter making up everything.”\nNavani had read many theories about such a smallest division of matter.\nIt spoke to her state of mind that she barely considered it a curiosity to have\nsuch theories confirmed by a divine source.\n“Do these axi have a polarity?” Navani asked, as she monitored the\ntemperature of her experiment.\n“They must,” Raboniel said. “We theorize that axial interconnection is\nwhat holds things together. Certain Surges influence this. The forces\nbetween axi are fundamental to the way the cosmere works.”\nNavani grunted, writing another notation from the thermometer.\n“What are you doing?” Raboniel asked.\n“Seeing if a colder temperature changes the vibrations in a gemstone,”\nNavani admitted. “Would you hold this one and tell me if the rhythm\nchanges—or grows louder—as it warms up?”\n“I can do that,” Raboniel said, settling down on the floor beside the desk.\nBehind, her daughter mimicked her. The attendant—a singer in workform—\nknelt to dab at the daughter’s lips.\nNavani took the gemstone out with a pair of tongs and gave it to\nRaboniel. Though Navani could faintly hear the tones of gemstones if she\npressed a lot of them to her skin, her skill wasn’t fine-tuned enough to\ndetect small changes in volume. She needed a singer to finish this\nexperiment. But how to keep Raboniel from figuring out what she’d\ndiscovered?\nRaboniel took the sphere and waited, her eyes closed. Finally she shook\nher head. “I can sense no change in the tone. Why does it matter?”\n“I’m trying to determine if anything alters the tone,” Navani said.\n“Creating Warlight requires a slight alteration of Odium’s and Honor’s\ntones, in order to put them into harmony. If I can find other things that alter\nVoidlight’s tone, I might be able to create other hybrids.”\nIt was a plausible enough explanation. It should explain her requests for\nplates and other devices, even the ice.\n“A novel line of reasoning,” Raboniel said to her curiosity rhythm.\n“I had not thought you would take notice,” Navani said. “I assumed you\nwere busy with your … work.” Unmaking the Sibling.\n“I still need to bring down the final node,” Raboniel said. “Last time I\ntouched the Sibling, I thought I could sense it.

Raboniel lingered as Navani\nrecorded her notes about the ice water experiment.\nNavani managed to appear unconcerned right until she heard the plates\nbeing shifted. She turned to see Raboniel pulling out the new one, the one\nshe’d hidden beneath several others. Damnation. How had she picked out\nthat one? Perhaps it showed the most use.\nRaboniel looked to Navani, who forced herself to turn away as if it were\nnothing. Then Raboniel played it.\nNavani breathed out quietly, closing her eyes. She’d racked her mind for\nways to hide what she was doing, taking every precaution she could … but\nshe should have known. She was at such a severe disadvantage, watched at\nall times, with Raboniel always nearby. Navani opened her eyes and found\nRaboniel staring wide-eyed at the plate. She placed a sphere of Voidlight\nand played again, watching the Light eject from the sphere.\nRaboniel spoke to a reverential rhythm. “A tone that forces out\nVoidlight?”\nNavani kept her face impassive. Well, that answered one question. She’d\nwondered if the person playing the note needed the proper Intent to eject the\nVoidlight, but it seemed that creating the plate to align to her hummed tones\nwas enough.\n“Navani,” Raboniel said, lowering the bow, “this is remarkable. And\ndangerous. I felt the Voidlight in my gemheart respond. It wasn’t ejected,\nbut my very soul cringed at the sound. I’m shocked. And … and befuddled.\nHow did you create this?”\n“Math,” Navani admitted. “And inspiration.”\n“This could lead to…” Raboniel hummed to herself, then glanced at the\nbucket of ice water. “You’re trying to find a way to dampen the vibrations\nof the Voidlight so you can rewrite it with a different tone. A different\npolarity. That’s why you asked about axi.” She hummed to an excited\nrhythm. And Damnation if a part of Navani wasn’t caught up in that sound.\nIn the thrill of discovery. Of being so close.\nCareful, Navani, she reminded herself. She had to do her best to keep\nthis knowledge from the enemy. There was a way, a plan she’d been making\nshould Raboniel intrude as she had. A possible path to maintaining the\nsecrets of anti-Voidlight.\nFor now, she needed to seem amenable. “Yes,” Navani said. “I think\nwhat you wanted all along is possible, Raboniel. I have reason to believe\nthere is an opposite Light to Voidlight.”\n“Have you written this down?”\n“No, I’ve merely been toying with random ideas.”\n“A lie you must tell,” Raboniel said. “I do not begrudge you it, Navani.\nBut know that I will rip this room apart to find your notes, if I must.”\nNavani remained quiet, meeting Raboniel’s gaze."

Within reach of something\nthat could kill a god? All because we worked together. Let’s take this last\nstep as one.”\nNavani debated. She knew that Raboniel wasn’t lying; the Fused would\nrip this room apart to find Navani’s notes. Beyond that, she’d likely take\naway Navani’s ability to requisition supplies—halting her progress.\nAnd she was so close.\nWith a sigh, Navani crossed the room and took her notebook—the one\nthey’d named Rhythm of War—from a hidden spot under one of the shelves.\nPerhaps Navani should have kept all of her discoveries in her head, but\nshe’d been unable to resist writing them down. She’d needed to see her\nideas on the page, to use notes, to get as far as she had.\nRaboniel settled in to read, to learn what Navani had discovered about\nthis new tone—humming a rhythm of curiosity to herself. A short time later,\na servant arrived at the door carrying a large wooden box.\n“At last.” Navani stepped over, taking the box from the servant. Inside\nwas a glass tube a little less than a foot in diameter, though it was several\nfeet long, with thick metal caps on the ends.\n“And that is?” Raboniel asked.\n“A Thaylen vacuum tube,” Navani said. “From the Royal Institute of\nBarometric Studies. We had this device near the top floor of the tower,\nwhere we were doing weather experiments.”\nShe set the device down and took the notebook back from Raboniel,\nmaking a few notations to start her next experiment. The metal caps could\nbe unscrewed to reveal chambers that, with the seals in place, wouldn’t\ndisturb the vacuum in the central glass chamber. She opened one end, then\naffixed an empty diamond into it. Next she used her jeweler’s hammer to\ncrack a gem full of Voidlight—which made it start to leak. She quickly\naffixed it into the berth on the other side of the vacuum tube. She redid the\nends, then used a fabrial pump to remove the air from the side chambers.\nFinally, she undid the clasps that sealed the side berths, opening them to\nthe central vacuum. If she’d done everything correctly, little to no air would\nenter the central glass chamber—and she now had a gemstone on either\nend.\nRaboniel loomed over Navani as she observed the Voidlight floating out\ninto the vacuum. It didn’t act as air would have—it wasn’t pulled out, for\nexample. Whatever Voidlight was, it didn’t seem to be made up of axi. It\nwas an energy, a power.\n“What are we doing?” Raboniel asked softly."

It\nwas an energy, a power.\n“What are we doing?” Raboniel asked softly.\n“I believe this is the only way to completely separate Voidlight from the\nsongs of Roshar,” Navani explained. “There can be no sound in a vacuum,\nas there is no air to transfer the waves. So as this gemstone ejects Voidlight,\nI’m hoping the Light will not be able to ‘hear’ Odium’s rhythm—for the\nfirst time in its existence.”\n“You think it doesn’t emit the rhythm itself,” Raboniel said, “but echoes\nit. Picks it up.”\n“Like spren pick up mannerisms from humans,” Navani said. “Or how a\npiece of metal can be magnetized by touching a magnet over a long period\nof time.”\n“Ingenious,” Raboniel whispered.\n“We’ll see,” Navani said. She grabbed her bow, then pressed the plate\nagainst the side of the vacuum chamber and began playing her anti-\nVoidlight tone.\nRaboniel winced at the sound. “The Light won’t be able to hear,” she\nsaid. “It’s in a vacuum, as you said.”\n“Yes, but it’s moving across, and will soon touch the empty diamond at\nthe other side,” Navani said. “I want this to be the first thing it hears when it\ntouches matter.”\nThey had to wait a good while as the Voidlight drifted in the vacuum, but\nNavani kept playing. In a way, this was the culmination of her days of\nfervor. The climax to the symphony of madness she’d been composing.\nVoidlight eventually touched the empty diamond and was pulled inside.\nShe waited until a good measure of it had been drawn in, then had Raboniel\nundo the clasp separating the diamond’s enclosure from the vacuum.\nNavani opened this to a little pop of sound, then plucked out the diamond. It\nglowed faintly violet-black. She stared at it, looking closer, until …\nYes. A faint warping of the air around it. She felt a thrill as she handed it\nto Raboniel—who screamed.\nNavani caught the diamond as Raboniel dropped it. The Fused pulled her\nhand to her breast, humming violently.\n“I take it the sound wasn’t pleasant,” Navani said.\n“It was like the tone that plate makes,” Raboniel said, “but a thousand\ntimes worse. This is a wrongness. A vibration that should not exist.”\n“It sounds exactly the same as the tone of Odium to me,” Navani said.\nShe set the gemstone on her desk beside the dagger Raboniel had given her.\nThe one that could channel and move Light.\nNavani sat in the chair beside it. Raboniel joined her, moving a stool\nfrom beside the wall. Together, both of them stared at the little gemstone\nthat seemed so wrong.\n“Navani,” Raboniel said. “This … This changes the world.”\n“I know,” Navani said. She rubbed her forehead, sighing.\n“You look exhausted,” Raboniel noted.\n“I’ve barely slept for days,” Navani admitted. “Honestly, this is all so\noverwhelming. I need a break, Raboniel. To walk, to think, to gather my\nwits and get my blood moving again.”"

To walk, to think, to gather my\nwits and get my blood moving again.”\n“Go ahead,” Raboniel said. “I’ll wait.” She waved for the guard to go\nwith Navani, though the Fused herself continued staring at the gemstone. In\nfact, Raboniel was so fixated on the diamond that she didn’t notice Navani\ntake Rhythm of War as she stepped out with the guard into the hallway.\nShe braced herself. Expecting …\nAn explosion.\nIt shook the corridor, striking with such physical force that Navani’s\nguard jumped in shock. They both spun around to see smoke spewing from\nthe room they’d left. The guard rushed back—grabbing Navani by the arm\nand hauling her along.\nThey found chaos. The desk had exploded, and Raboniel lay on the floor.\nThe Fused’s face was a mask of pain, and her front had been shredded—her\nhavah ripped apart, the carapace scored and broken, the skin at her joints\nstuck with pieces of glass. Or diamond? She hadn’t taken much shrapnel to\nthe head, fortunately for her, though orange blood seeped from a thousand\nlittle wounds on her arms and chest.\nAt any rate, Raboniel was still alive, and Navani’s scheme had failed.\nNavani had assumed that, in her absence, Raboniel would take the next step\n—to try mixing Voidlight with the new Light. Raboniel kept saying she\nexpected the Lights to puff away when mixed, vanishing. She didn’t expect\nthe explosion.\nNavani had hoped that if she died, it would delay Raboniel’s corruption\nof the tower long enough for Navani to properly weaponize this new Light.\nThat was not to be. The explosion had been smaller than the one that had\ndestroyed the room with the scholars, and Raboniel was far tougher than a\nhuman.\nA treasonous part of Navani was glad the Fused had not died. Raboniel\nsat up, then surveyed the room. Several of the bookshelves had collapsed,\nspilling their contents. Raboniel’s daughter was still sitting where she’d\nbeen, as if she hadn’t even noticed what had happened, despite the fact that\nshe bore cuts on her face. Her attendant appeared to be dead, lying slumped\non the ground, facedown. Navani felt a spike of legitimate sorrow for that.\n“What did you do?” Navani said. “Lady of Wishes, what happened?”\nRaboniel blinked as she stood. “I … put the diamond we created into the\nhilt of the dagger, then used the tip to draw Voidlight from another\ngemstone, to mix them. It seemed the best way to see if the two Lights\nwould cancel one another out. I thought … I thought the reaction would be\ncalm, like hot and cold water mixing.…”\n“Hot and cold water don’t immediately annihilate one another when they\nmeet,” Navani said. “Besides, heat under pressure—like Light in a\ngemstone—is another matter.”\n“Yes,” Raboniel said, blinking several times, seeming dazed. “If you use\nthe lightning of a stormform to ignite something under pressure, it always\nexplodes.

But these were inside a gemstone. I have acted with\nsupreme stupidity.”\nOther Fused—Deepest Ones—melded in through the walls to see what\nhad happened. Raboniel waved them all off as her cuts healed under the\npower of her internal Voidlight. The Deepest Ones took the servant, who\nfortunately stirred as they carried him.\nThe desk was broken, the wall marked by a black scar. Navani smelled\nsmoke—bits of desk still burned. So the explosion had involved heat, not\npressure alone. Raboniel shooed away the guard and the other Fused, then\npicked through the rubble of the desk.\n“No remnants of the dagger,” Raboniel said. “Another embarrassment I\nmust suffer, losing such a valuable weapon. I have others, but I’ll need to\neventually move you out of this room and have it scrubbed for every scrap\nof raysium. We might be able to melt it down and reforge the dagger.”\nNavani nodded.\n“For now,” Raboniel said, “I would like you to make me another\ngemstone filled with that anti-Voidlight.”\n“Now?” Navani asked.\n“If you please.”\n“Don’t you want to change?” Navani asked. “Have someone pick the\nshards of glass out of your skin…”\n“No,” Raboniel said. “I wish to see this process again. If you please,\nNavani.”\nIt was said to a rhythm that indicated it would happen, regardless of what\nNavani “pleased.” So she prepared the vacuum chamber—it had been\nbehind Raboniel, sheltered from the brunt of the blast, fortunately. As\nNavani worked, Raboniel sent someone for another Herald-killing dagger.\nWhy did she need that? Surely they weren’t going to mix the Lights after\nwhat had happened.\nFeeling an ominous cloud hanging over her, Navani repeated her\nexperiment, this time filling the gemstone a little less—just in case—before\nremoving it and holding it up.\nRaboniel took it, and though she didn’t drop it this time, she did flinch.\n“So strange,” she said. She fitted it into her second dagger. Then she undid a\nscrew and slipped out the piece of metal running through the center. She\nflipped it around—it had points on both ends, and a hole for the screw—\nbefore replacing it.\n“To make the anti-Voidlight flow out of the gemstone along the blade?”\nNavani asked. “Instead of drawing in what it touches?”\n“Indeed,” Raboniel said. “You may wish to take cover.” Then she turned,\nwalked across the room, and stabbed her daughter in the chest.\nNavani was too stunned to move. She stood there amid the rubble,\ngaping as Raboniel loomed over the other Fused, pushing the weapon in\ndeeper. The younger Fused began to spasm, and Raboniel held her, ruthless\nas she pressed the weapon into her daughter’s flesh.\nThere was no explosion.

There was a stench of burning\nflesh, and the skin blistered around the wound. The younger Fused trembled\nand screamed, clutching at her mother’s arm with a clawed hand.\nThen her eyes turned milky, like white marble. She went limp, and\nNavani thought she saw something escape her lips. Smoke? As if her entire\ninsides had been burned away.\nRaboniel pulled the dagger out, then tossed it away like a piece of\nrubbish. She cradled her daughter’s body, pressing her forehead against that\nof the corpse, holding it close and rocking back and forth.\nNavani walked over, listening to Raboniel’s sorrowful rhythm. Though\nRaboniel’s topknot of hair spilled around her face, Navani saw tears\nslipping down her red-and-black cheeks.\nNavani wasn’t certain she’d ever seen a singer cry before. This was not\nruthlessness at all. This was something else.\n“You killed her,” Navani whispered.\nRaboniel continued to rock the corpse, holding it tighter, shaking as she\nhummed.\n“Elithanathile,” Navani said, whispering the tenth name of the Almighty.\n“You killed her forever, didn’t you?”\n“No more rebirth,” Raboniel whispered. “No more Returns. Free at last,\nmy baby. Free.”\nNavani pulled her hand up to her chest. That pain … she knew that pain.\nIt was how she’d felt hearing of Elhokar’s death at the hands of the\nbridgeman traitor.\nRaboniel had done this killing though. Performed it herself! But … had\nthe actual death happened long ago? Centuries ago? What had it been like,\nliving with a child whose body constantly returned to life long after her\nmind had left her?\n“This is why,” Navani said, kneeling beside the two. “Your god hinted\nthat anti-Voidlight was possible, and you suspected what it would do. You\ncaptured the tower, you imprisoned and pushed me, and possibly delayed\nthe corruption of the Sibling. Because you hoped to find this anti-Voidlight.\nNot because you wanted a weapon against Odium. Because you wanted to\nshow a mercy to your daughter.”\n“We could never create enough of this anti-Light to threaten Odium,”\nRaboniel whispered. “That was another lie, Navani. I’m sorry. But you took\nmy dream and you fulfilled it. After I had given up on it, you persisted. One\nmight think the immortal being would be the one to continue pursuing an\nidea to its end, but it was you.”\nNavani knelt with her hands in her lap, feeling like she’d witnessed\nsomething too intimate. So she gave Raboniel time to grieve.\nFused grieved. The immortal destroyers, the mythical enemies of all life,\ngrieved. Raboniel’s grief looked identical to that of a human mother who\nhad lost her child.\nEventually, Raboniel rested the body on the ground, then covered up the\nwound with a cloth from her pocket. She wiped her eyes and stood, calling\nfor the guard to bring her some servants.\n“What now?” Navani asked her."

If Essu has indeed died a final\ndeath, then we’ll know you and I have achieved our goal. And…” She\ntrailed off, then hummed a rhythm.\n“What?” Navani asked.\n“Our notebook.” Raboniel looked toward where it sat on the floor.\nNavani had placed it there while creating the second anti-Voidlight\ngemstone.\nRaboniel hummed a different rhythm as servants entered, and she gave\nterse orders. She sent some to burn her daughter’s corpse and send honors\nand the ashes to the family that had donated the body to her daughter. She\nhad others gather the vacuum tube and metal plates from Navani’s\nexperiments.\nNavani stepped forward to stop them, but Raboniel prevented her with a\ncalm—but firm—hand. The Fused took the notebook from Navani’s fingers.\n“I will have a copy made for you,” she promised Navani. “For now, I\nneed this one to reconstruct your work.”\n“You saw how I did this, Raboniel.”\n“Yes, but I need to create a new plate, a new tone. For Stormlight.”\nNavani tried to pull free, but Raboniel’s hold was firm. She hummed a\ndangerous rhythm, making Navani meet her eyes. Eyes that had been\nweeping were now firm and unyielding.\n“So much for your words about working together,” Navani said. “And\nyou dared imply I was wrong to keep trying to hide things from you.”\n“I will end the war,” Raboniel said. “That is the promise I will keep, for\ntoday we have discovered the means. Finally. A way to make certain that\nthe Radiants can no longer fight. They function as Fused do, you see. If we\nkill the human, another Radiant will be born. The fight becomes eternal,\nboth sides immortal. Today we end that. I have preserved the Radiants in\nthe tower for a reason. Anti-Stormlight will need subjects for testing.”\n“You can’t be implying…” Navani said. “You don’t mean…”\n“Today is a momentous day,” Raboniel said, letting go and walking after\nthe servants carrying Navani’s equipment. “Today is the day we discovered\na way to destroy Radiant spren. I will let you know the results of the test.”\nTHE END OF\nPart Four\nHesina made a small notation in her notebook, kneeling above a map she’d\nrolled out on the floor. The cache Rlain had brought included five maps of\nAlethkar focused on different princedoms. Sadeas’s was included, with\nnotes about singer troop placements in certain cities and whatever else the\nscouts had seen while doing reconnaissance of the area.\nIt had taken her until now to realize she could check on Tomat. The city\nhad several long paragraphs of attached observations, written by Kara the\nWindrunner. The singers had the city wall under repair, which was\nincredible on its own. That had been broken since … what, her\ngrandfather’s days? The infamous Gap would be gone if she ever visited\nagain."

The Windrunners hadn’t been able to get too close,\nafter all. At least there were no reports of burnt-out houses, as in some other\ncities. It seemed the city had given in without too much of a fight, which\nboded well for local survival rates.\nShe wrote each detail in her notebook, then glanced up as Lirin slipped\ninto their sectioned-off surgery chamber. He let the draped sheets fall\nclosed, fabric rustling. He’d been studying the large model of Urithiru that\nwas at the back of the infirmary room.\n“You found Tomat?” he asked, adjusting his spectacles and leaning down\nbeside her. “Huh. Anything useful?”\n“Not much,” she said. “Similar notes to other cities.”\n“Well, we’d probably know if your father died,” Lirin said, straightening\nto gather some bandages from the counter.\n“And how is that?”\n“He’d be haunting me, obviously,” Lirin said. “Living as a shade in the\nstorms, calling for my blood. As I haven’t heard a thing, I must assume the\nold monster is alive.”\nHesina rolled up the map and gave her husband a flat glare, which he\naccepted with a smile and a twinkle to his eye.\n“It’s been twenty-five years,” Hesina said. “He might have softened\ntoward you by now.”\n“Stone doesn’t soften with time, dear,” Lirin replied. “It merely grows\nbrittle. I think we’d sooner see a chull fly than see your father grow soft.”\nHe must have noticed that the topic legitimately worried her, because he\nturned away from the gibes. “I’d bet that he’s fine, Hesina. Some men are\ntoo ornery to be bothered by something as mundane as an invasion.”\n“He wouldn’t give up his business easily, Lirin. He’s stubborn as a\nlighteyes—he’d order his guards to fight, even when everyone else had\nsurrendered.”\nLirin returned to his work, and after a short delay, said, “I’m sure he’s\nfine.”\n“You are thinking that if he lifted a sword,” Hesina said, “he deserved\nwhatever he got.”\nAnd her father would use a sword. Under a special writ of forbearance\nfrom the citylord, who—even three decades ago—had been accustomed to\ndoing whatever her father bullied him into doing. She’d met only one man\nwho dared defy him.\n“I’m thinking,” Lirin said, “that my wife needs a supportive husband, not\na self-righteous one.”\n“And our son?” she asked. “Which version of you does he deserve?”\nLirin stiffened, bandages held in front of him. She turned away, trying to\ncontain her emotions. She hadn’t planned to snap at him, but … well, she\nsupposed she hadn’t forgiven him for driving Kaladin away.\nLirin quietly stepped over, then settled down on the floor beside her,"

But would you have insisted on bringing him here?”\n“Maybe. He could have needed extended care, Hesina. Isn’t it better to\nbring him here, where I can watch him? Better than letting him go on\nfighting an impossible battle, getting himself and others killed in this\nfoolish war.”\n“And would you have done that to another soldier?” she pressed. “Say it\nwasn’t your son who was wounded. Would you have brought that boy here\nand risked him being imprisoned, maybe executed? You’ve healed soldiers\nbefore, sending them back out to fight. That’s always been your conviction.\nTreat anyone, no strings attached, no matter the circumstances.”\n“Maybe I need to rethink that policy,” he said. “Besides, Kaladin has\ntold me many times that he’s not my son any longer.”\n“Great. I’m glad we could chat so I could persuade you to be more\nstubborn. I see that your thoughts and feelings are evolving on this topic—\nand because you’re you, they’re going the absolute wrong direction.”\nLirin sighed. He stood and grabbed the stack of bandages, then turned to\nleave their little draped-off chamber.\nStorm it, she wasn’t done with him yet. Hesina rose, surprised at the\ndepth of her frustration. “Don’t you leave,” she snapped, causing him to\nstop by the drapes.\n“Hesina,” he said, sounding tired. “What do you want from me?”\nShe stalked over to him, pointing. “I left everything for you, Lirin. Do\nyou know why?”\n“Because you believed in me?”\n“Because I loved you. And I still love you.”\n“Love can’t change the realities of our situation.”\n“No, but it can change people.” She seized his hand, less a comforting\ngesture and more a demand that he remain there with her, so they could face\nthis together. “I know how stressed you feel. I feel it too—feel like I’m\ngoing to get crushed by it.

Some crazed killer who enjoys it, or the boy\nyou trained to care?”\nHe hesitated, then opened his mouth.\n“Before you say you don’t want anyone fighting,” Hesina interrupted,\n“know that I’ll recognize that as a lie. We both know you’ve admitted that\npeople need to fight sometimes. You simply don’t want it to be your son,\ndespite the fact that he’s probably the best person we could have chosen.”\n“You obviously know the responses you want from me,” Lirin said. “So\nwhy should I bother speaking?”\nHesina groaned, tipping her head back. “You can be so storming\nfrustrating.”\nIn return, he squeezed her hand gently. “I’m sorry,” he said, his voice\nsofter. “I’ll try to listen better, Hesina. I promise.”\n“Don’t just listen better,” she said, pulling him out of the draped-off\nsection and waving toward the larger room. “See better. Look. What do you\nsee?”\nThe place was busy with humans who wanted to care for the Radiants.\nHesina had instituted a rotation so that everyone got a chance. Beneath the\ngaze of two watching stormform Regals, people of all ethnicities—and\nwearing all kinds of clothing—moved among the comatose Radiants.\nAdministering water, changing sheets, brushing hair.\nHesina and Lirin used a more carefully cultivated group—mostly ardents\n—to handle delicate matters like bathing the patients, but today’s caregivers\nwere common inhabitants of the tower. Darkeyes made up the majority of\nthese, but each and every one wore a shash glyph like Kaladin’s painted on\ntheir forehead.\n“What do you see?” Hesina whispered again to Lirin.\n“Honestly?” he asked.\n“Yes.”\n“I see fools,” he said, “refusing to accept the truth. Resisting, when\nthey’ll just get crushed.”\nShe heard the words he left off: Like I was.\nShe towed him by his arm to one side of the room, where a man with\nonly one arm sat on a stool, painting the glyph on a young girl’s head. She\nran off to her duty as Lirin and Hesina arrived. The man stood respectfully.\nBearded, wearing a buttoned shirt and trousers, he had three moles on his\ncheek. He nodded to Hesina and Lirin. Almost a bow. As far as he could go\nwithout provoking a reaction from the watching Fused, who didn’t like such\nsigns of respect shown to other humans.\n“I know you,” Lirin said, narrowing his eyes at the man. “You’re one of\nthe refugees who came to Hearthstone.”\n“I’m Noril, sir,” the man said. “You sent me to the ardents, on suicide\nwatch. Thank you for trying to help.”\n“Well,” Lirin said, “you seem to be doing better.”"

Thank you for trying to help.”\n“Well,” Lirin said, “you seem to be doing better.”\n“Depends on the day, sir,” Noril said. “But I’d say I’m better than I was\nwhen you met me.”\nLirin glanced at Hesina, who squeezed his hand and gestured her chin\ntoward Noril’s forehead and the glyph.\n“Why do you wear that glyph?” Lirin asked.\n“To honor Stormblessed, who still fights.” Noril nodded, as if to himself.\n“I’ll be ready when he calls for me, sir.”\n“Don’t you see the irony in that?” Lirin asked. “It was fighting in your\nhomeland that made you flee, and therefore get into all the trouble you’ve\nfaced. Fighting lost you everything. If people would stop with this\nnonsense, I would have to see far fewer men with battle shock like yours.”\nNoril settled down on his stool and used his hand to stir his cup of black\npaint, which he placed between his knees. “Suppose you’re right, sir. Can’t\nargue with a surgeon about the nonsense we do. But sir, do you know why I\nget up each day?”\nLirin shook his head.\n“It’s hard sometimes,” Noril said, stirring. “Coming awake means\nleaving the nothingness, you know? Remembering the pain. But then I\nthink, ‘Well, he gets up.’”\n“You mean Kaladin?” Lirin asked.\n“Yes, sir,” Noril said. “He’s got the emptiness, bad as I do. I can see it in\nhim. We all can. But he gets up anyway. We’re trapped in here, and we all\nwant to do something to help. We can’t, but somehow he can.\n“And you know, I’ve listened to ardents talk. I’ve been poked and\nprodded. I’ve been stuck in the dark. None of that worked as well as\nknowing this one thing, sir. He still gets up. He still fights. So I figure … I\nfigure I can too.”\nHesina squeezed Lirin’s hand again, pulling him away as she thanked\nNoril with a smile.\n“You want me to acknowledge,” Lirin whispered, “that what Kaladin’s\ndoing is helping that man, while my surgeon’s treatments could have done\nnothing.”\n“You said you’d listen,” she said. “You asked what I want of you? I want\nyou to talk to them, Lirin. The people in this room. Don’t challenge them.\nDon’t argue with them. Simply ask them why they wear that glyph. And see\nthem, Lirin. Please.”\nShe left him standing there and returned to her maps. Trusting in him,\nand the man she knew he was.\nAdin was going to be a Windrunner someday.\nHe had it all figured out. Yes, he was just a potter’s son, and spent his\ndays learning how to turn crem into plates. But the highmarshal himself had\nonce been a darkeyed boy from an unknown village. The spren didn’t just\npick kings and queens. They watched everyone, looking for warriors."

They watched everyone, looking for warriors.\nSo, as he followed his father through the halls of Urithiru, Adin found\nopportunities to glare at the invaders. Many might have said that at thirteen,\nhe was too young to become a Radiant. But he knew for a fact there was a\ngirl who had been chosen when she was younger than him. He had seen her\nleaving food out for old Gavam, the widow who sometimes forgot to collect\nher rations.\nYou had to be brave, even when you thought nobody was watching. That\nwas what the spren wanted. They didn’t care how old you were, if your eyes\nwere dark, or if the bowls you made were lopsided. They wanted you to be\nbrave.\nGlaring at singers wasn’t much. He knew he could—and would have to\n—do more. When the time was right. And he couldn’t let the enemy catch\nhim being unruly. So for now, he stepped to the side of the corridor with his\nfather and let the large group of warforms pass. He dutifully stood there, his\nfather’s hand on his shoulder, their heads bowed.\nBut as soon as the warforms had passed, Adin looked up. And he glared\nafter them, angry as he could be.\nHe wasn’t the only one. He caught Shar, the seamstress’s daughter,\nglaring too. Well, her uncle was a Windrunner, so maybe she figured she\nhad a better chance than most—but surely the spren were more discerning\nthan that. Shar was so bossy, you’d think she was lighteyed.\nDoesn’t matter, Adin reminded himself. The spren don’t care if you’re\nbossy. They just want you to be brave. Well, he could handle a little\ncompetition from Shar. And when he got his spren first, maybe he could\ngive her a few tips.\nAdin’s father caught him glaring, unfortunately, and squeezed his\nshoulder. “Eyes down,” he hissed.\nAdin obeyed reluctantly, as another group of soldiers marched past—all\nheading for the atrium. Had there been some kind of disturbance? Adin had\nbetter not have missed another appearance by Stormblessed. He couldn’t\nbelieve he’d spent the last fight napping.\nHe hoped the spren would look at people’s parents when choosing their\nRadiants. Because Adin’s father was extremely brave. Oh, he didn’t glare at\npassing soldiers, but he didn’t need to. Adin’s father spent many afternoons\ntending the fallen Radiants. Directly beneath the gaze of the Fused. And\nevery night he went out in secret, doing something.\nOnce the soldiers passed, everyone else continued on their way. Adin’s\nankle hurt a little, but it mostly felt better from when he’d hurt it. So he\ndidn’t even limp anymore. He didn’t want a spren to see him acting weak.\nWhat was going on? He went up on his toes, trying to look over the\ncrowd, but his father didn’t let him linger. Together they entered the market,\nthen turned toward Master Liganor’s shop.

How could they continue making pottery at a time like\nthis? How could Master Liganor open the shop for business like nothing\nwas happening? Well, that was part of their bravery. Adin had figured it out.\nThey entered the back of the shop and set up in the workroom. Adin got\nbusy, knowing that they had to act normal—so the enemy wouldn’t figure\nout something was up. You had to get them to feel secure, comfortable.\nToday, Adin did that by heaving out his bucket of crem, pouring off the\nwater on top, and mixing it until it was a paste. Then he mashed it for his\nfather until it was just the right consistency—a little more squishy than\ndough.\nHe worked the lump aggressively, showing those spren—who were\nundoubtedly watching him by now—that he had good strong arms.\nWindrunners needed strong arms, because they didn’t use their legs much,\non account of them flying around everywhere.\nAs he worked the crem—his arms starting to burn, the earthy scent of\nwet rock filling the air—he heard the front door shut. Master Liganor had\narrived. The old man was nice, for a lighteyes. Once upon a time, he’d done\nall the glaze work on the pottery himself, but now it was all completed by\nGub, the other journeyman besides Adin’s father.\nAdin mashed the crem to the proper consistency, then handed a chunk to\nhis father, who had been cleaning and setting the wheel. Adin’s father\nhefted it, pushed one finger in, then nodded approvingly. “Make another\nbatch,” he said, putting the chunk onto his wheel. “We’ll practice your\nplates.”\n“I won’t need to be able to make plates once I can fly,” Adin said.\n“And what if it takes you until your twenties to become a Windrunner?”\nhis father asked. “You’ll need to do something with your time until then.\nMight as well make plates.”\n“Spren don’t care about plates.”\n“They must,” his father said, spinning up the wheel by pumping his foot\non the pedal. “Their Radiants have to eat, after all.” He started shaping the\ncrem. “Never underestimate the value of a job well done, Adin. You want a\nspren to notice you? Take pride in every job you do. Men who make sloppy\nplates will be sloppy fighting Fused.”\nAdin narrowed his eyes. How did his father know that? Was it merely\nanother piece of wisdom drawn from his never-ending well of fatherly\nquips, or … was it from personal experience? Regardless, Adin dragged out\nanother bucket of crem. They were running low. Where would they get\nmore, now that traders weren’t coming in from the Plains?\nHe was halfway through mixing the new batch when Master Liganor\nentered, wringing his hands. Short, bald, and tubby, he looked like a vase—\nthe kind that had been made with too short a neck to really be useful.

He kept sculpting, wetting his fingers\nabsently.\n“What do you think?” Master Liganor asked.\n“A good idea,” Adin’s father replied. “Put out the glyph for lunch, and\nmaybe we can reopen later.”\n“Good, good,” the master said, bustling out of the workshop into the\nattached showroom. “I think … I think I’ll head to my room for a while.\nYou’ll keep working? We’re low on water pots. As always.”\nMaster Liganor closed and latched the wooden windows at the front of\nthe small shop, then locked the door. Then he went upstairs to his rooms.\nAs soon as he was gone, Adin’s father stood up, leaving a pot half-\nfinished on the wheel. “Watch the shop, son,” he said, washing his hands,\nthen walked toward the back door.\nShort, with curly hair and a quiet way about him, he was not the type\nsomeone would pick out of a crowd as a hero. Yet Adin knew exactly where\nhe was going. Adin stood up, hands coated in crem. “You’re going to go see\nwhat’s happening, aren’t you? In the atrium?”\nHis father hesitated, his hand on the doorknob. “Stay here and watch the\nshop.”\n“You’re going to paint your head with the glyph,” Adin said, “and go\nwatch over the Radiants. Just in case. I want to go with you.”\n“Your ankle—”\n“Is fine now,” Adin said. “If something does go wrong, you’ll need me to\nrun home and tell Mother. Plus, if there’s trouble, there could be looting\nhere in the market. I’ll be safer with you.”\nAdin’s father debated, then sighed and waved him forward. Adin felt his\nheart thundering in his chest as he hurried to obey. He could feel it, an\nenergy in the air. It would happen today.\nToday, he’d pick up a spear and earn his spren.\nTaravangian had given up on being smart.\nIt seemed that the longer he lived, the less his intelligence varied each\nday. And when it did vary, it seemed to move steadily downward. Toward\nstupidity. Toward sentimentality. His “smart” days lately would have been\naverage just months ago.\nHe needed to act anyway.\nHe could not afford to wait upon intelligence. The world could not afford\nto wait upon the whims of his situation. Unfortunately, Taravangian had no\nidea how to proceed. He’d failed to recruit Szeth; Taravangian was too\nstupid to manipulate that man now. He’d started a dozen letters to Dalinar,\nand ripped them all up.\nThe right words.

He couldn’t.\nWorse, each day he found time slipping away faster and faster. He’d\nwake from a nap in his chair and the entire day had passed. Usually it was\nthe pain that woke him.\nHe wasn’t simply old. He wasn’t simply feeble. This was worse.\nToday, Taravangian forced himself to move to keep from drifting off\nagain. He hobbled through his prison of a house. Trying so hard to think.\nThere had to be a solution!\nGo to Dalinar, a part of him urged. Don’t write him. Talk to him. Was\nTaravangian actually waiting on the right words, or was there another\nreason he delayed? A willing disregard for the truth. The slightly smarter\nversion of him didn’t want to give this up to the Blackthorn.\nHe shuffled toward the small bathroom on the main floor, leafing through\nhis notebook, looking over hundreds of crossed-out notes and ideas. The\nanswer was here. He felt it. It was so frustrating, knowing how smart he\ncould be, yet living below that capacity so much of the time. Other people\ndidn’t understand intelligence and stupidity. They assumed people who\nwere stupid were somehow less human—less capable of making decisions\nor plans.\nThat wasn’t it at all. He could plan, he merely needed time. He could\nremember things, given a chance to drill them into his brain. Part of being\nsmart, in his experience, was about speed more than capacity. That and the\nability to memorize. When he’d created problems to test his daily\nintelligence, they had taken these dynamics into account, measuring how\nquickly he could do problems and how well he could remember the\nequations and principles needed to do so.\nHe had none of that ability now, but he needed none of it. The answer\nwas here, in the notebook. He settled down on the stool in his bathroom—\ntoo tired to move the seat elsewhere—as he flipped through the pages.\nTaravangian had a huge advantage over almost everyone else. Others,\nstupid or smart, tended to overestimate their abilities. Not Taravangian. He\nknew exactly how it felt to be both smart and stupid. He could use that.\nHe had to. He needed to use every advantage he had. He had to create a\nplan as daring as the Diagram—and do so without the gifts Cultivation had\ngiven him.\nThe plan of a man, not a god.\nHe racked his brain for anything in the Diagram relating to Nightblood,\nthe sword. But there was nothing. They hadn’t anticipated the sword. Still,\nhe had been given a report by agents he’d sent to research it by interviewing\none of its former bearers. Taravangian pulled tidbits from that report from\nthe recesses of his mind, then wrote them on a fresh page of his notebook.\nThe sword feeds on the essence that makes up all things, he wrote,\nscribbling by the light of a single ruby sphere. It will draw out Stormlight\neagerly, feasting. But if there is no Stormlight, it will feed on one’s own\nsoul. The agent had noted that Nightblood worked like a larkin, the beasts\nthat could feed on Investiture."

He can be tricked. And he seems to have a central … self, a core\nperson.\nSzeth had refused to listen to Taravangian. However, the man had come\nwhen Taravangian seeded the proper incentive out into the world. So maybe\nhe didn’t need to make Szeth do anything other than arrive in the same\nplace as Odium. The Shin assassin was reckless and unstable. Surely Szeth\nwould strike out against Odium if he saw the god manifesting.\nBut how? How can I possibly make the timing work?\nTaravangian sighed, his head thumping with pain. He looked across at\nthe small hand mirror he’d set up on the counter. The ruby sphere he was\nusing for light reflected in the mirror.\nBut his face did not reflect.\nInstead he saw a shadowy figure, female, with long flowing black hair.\nThe entire figure was a shadow, the eyes like white holes into nothingness.\nTaravangian blinked very slowly, then began to tremble with fear. Storms.\nStorms.\nHe attempted to gather his wits and control his emotions. He probably\nwould have run to hide if he had the strength. In this case, his weakening\nbody served him, as it forced him to sit there until he could control himself.\n“H … hello, Sja-anat,” he finally managed to say. “I had not realized any\nof the Un … Unmade were here.”\nWhat is wrong with you? a voice said in his mind, warped and distorted,\nlike a dozen voices overlapping. What has happened to you?\n“This is how I am sometimes. It is … the Nightwatcher’s fault.”\nNo, the other one. The god. She touched three that I know. The child. The\ngeneral. And you. The Old Magic … the Nightwatcher … I begin to wonder\nif it was all a cover, these many centuries. A way for her to secretly bring in\npeople she wanted to touch. She has been playing a far more subtle game\nthan Odium realized.\nWhy did you go to her? What did you ask?\n“For the capacity to stop what was coming,” he said. He was too\nfrightened to lie. Even the smart him hadn’t wanted to face one of these\nthings.\nShe sows many seeds, Sja-anat said. Can you do it? Can you stop what is\ncoming?\n“I don’t know,” Taravangian whispered. “Can it be stopped? Can … he\nbe stopped?”\nI am uncertain. The power behind him is strong, but his mind is exposed.\nThe mind and the power seek different goals. This leaves him … not weak,\nbut vulnerable.\n“I have wondered,” Taravangian said, glancing down at his notebook, “if\nhe is merely playing with me.

Odium searches for them. He watches me, certain I will\nmake a mistake and reveal my true intentions.

He\nwould have trouble counting how many times he’d performed this same\nlong hike across a fresh battlefield. It had become a habit to perform a kind\nof autopsy of the fighting as he surveyed its aftermath. One could read the\nmovements of troops by the way the dead had fallen.\nSwaths of singers there indicated a line had broken and chaos had ruled.\nHuman corpses bunched up against the wide river showed the enemy had\nused the waters—sluggish, since it had been a few days since the last storm\n—to push an entire company onto poor footing. Bodies stuck with arrows in\nthe front indicated the first beats of the battle—and arrows in the back\nindicated the last ones, as soldiers broke and fled. He passed many corpses\nstuck with arrows bearing white “goosefeathers,” a kind of fletching the\nHorneaters had delivered in batches to aid the war effort.\nBlood flowed across the field, seeking little rifts in the stone, places\nwhere rainwater had left its mark. The blood here was more orange than\nred, but the two mixed to make an unwholesome shade, the off-red of a\nrotting methi fruit.\nThe smoke hung heavy in the air. On a battlefield this far afield, you\nburned the dead right here—sending only the officers home, already made\ninto statues by the Soulcasters. Singer and human bodies smelled the same\nwhen they burned, a scent that would always bother him because of a\nspecific battlefield. A specific city. A burned-out scar that was the mark of\nhis greatest failure, and his greatest shame.\nCharnel groups moved through the dead today, solemnly cutting patches\nfrom uniforms, as each was supposed to have the man’s name inked on the\nback by the quartermaster scribe. Sometimes that didn’t happen. Or\nsometimes the writing was ruined in the fighting. Those families would go\nwithout closure for the rest of their lives. Knowing, but wondering anyway."

All Dalinar had to do was stop fighting. He wasn’t ready yet, but the\ntime might come. Every general knew there was a time to turn your sword\npoint down and deliver it to your enemy with head bowed. Surrender was a\nvalid tactic when your goal was the preservation of your people—at some\npoint, continuing to fight worked contrary to that goal.\nHe could trust that the Fused were not intent on extinction. Odium,\nhowever … he could not trust. Something told Dalinar the ancient god of\nhumankind, long abandoned, would not view this battlefield with the same\nregret Dalinar did.\nHe finished his grim survey, Szeth at his side as always. Several Azish\ngenerals, each newly decorated for their valor in this battle, also\naccompanied him. Along with two Emuli leaders, who were archers.\nRemarkably, the highest calling among the Emuli army was seen as archery.\nDalinar knew his way around a bow, though he’d never considered it a\nparticularly regal weapon, but here it was revered.\nDalinar walked a careful line for the local generals. He did not want\nthem to see how much he reviled the deaths. A commander could not afford\nto revile the work in which he engaged. It did not make them bad men to be\nproud of their victory, or to enjoy tactics and strategy. Dalinar’s forces\nwould not get far employing pacifists as field generals.\nBut storms … ever since he’d conquered the Thrill and sent it to be sunk\ndeep in the ocean, he’d found himself loathing these smells, these sights.\nThat was becoming his deepest secret: the Blackthorn had finally become\nwhat men had been accusing him of for years. A soldier who had lost the\nwill to kill.\nHe looped around, leaving the dead behind, instead passing victorious\ncompanies feasting in the very shadow of their butchery. He congratulated\nthem, acted like the figurehead he’d made of himself. Of all those he saw,\nonly the Mink seemed to notice the truth. That there was a reason Dalinar\nhad worked so hard to find his replacement.\nThe short Herdazian man fell in behind Dalinar. “The war in Emul is\ndone as of this battle,” the Mink said. “The rest is cleanup. Unless the\nenemy infuses his troops here with serious resources—which would be\nincredibly wasteful at this point—we’ll own Emul within the month.”\n“The enemy threw it away,” Dalinar said.\n“That’s a stronger term than I’d use,” the Mink said. “They fought. They\nwanted to hold. At the same time, they knew they couldn’t move resources\naway from Jah Keved right now. That would risk destabilizing there, and\nperhaps lead us to claim it in the coming months.\n“It is well the enemy wants to occupy and rule, not just destroy.

Alethkar next, then Herdaz.”\n“Urithiru before both,” Dalinar said. “But you have my word. No\noperations against the Iriali, no attempt to seize Jah Keved, until your\npeople are free.”\nHe likely didn’t need the promise—the Mink was a wily man, and had\neasily recognized that if Dalinar were ever to recover Alethkar, it would be\nthe best thing that could happen for an eventual recovery of the Mink’s\nhomeland. Once Jah Keved had gone to the enemy, Herdaz’s tactical\nimportance had soared.\nThe Mink departed to go enjoy the post-battle celebration with his\npersonal unit of Herdazian freedom fighters. Dalinar ended up in the small\nbattlefield command tent beside a goblet full of rubies. Couldn’t they have\nbeen a different color?\nStorms. It had been a long time since a battle had affected him like this.\nIt’s like I’m drifting in the ocean, he thought. We won today, but Navani\nis still trapped. If he couldn’t retake Urithiru, everything collapsed. Losing\nit was a huge setback in his true goal: pushing Odium to be frightened\nenough to make a deal.\nSo he sprang to his feet with relief when Sigzil the Windrunner entered,\nalong with two of his team and Stargyle the Lightweaver—a handsome man\nwith a soldier’s build and a ready smile. The name was a little much;\nDalinar doubted he’d had that one since birth, but he had a reputation for\nfriendliness, and the lighteyed women of the court certainly seemed to think\nhighly of him.\nLike the other Lightweavers, the man refused to wear a uniform.\nSomething about not feeling right wearing it again. Indeed, he bowed to\nDalinar instead of saluting.\n“Tell me good news, Radiant Sigzil,” Dalinar said. “Please.”\n“Stargyle?” Sigzil asked.\n“Sure thing,” Stargyle said, breathing in Stormlight from a pouch at his\nbelt.

Their success on the battlefields in this region\nmade Dalinar careful not to underestimate them. They might not have\nproper uniforms, but these were battle-hardened veterans.\n“Here, Brightlord,” Stargyle said—and the image began moving, as if in\nreal life. “I can keep it all in my head, so long as I focus on the colors.”\n“The colors?” Dalinar said.\n“I was a pigmenter’s son growing up, Brightlord. I’ve always seen the\nworld by its colors. Squint your eyes a little, and everything is really just\ncolor and shapes.”\nDalinar inspected the moving illusion. It depicted the entire camp of\npeople, and most interestingly a large pavilion at the center. It was colored\nin ringed patterns, like the bracelets he’d seen Tukari wear. He thought they\nhad religious significance, though he didn’t know much about the region.\nThe Tukari were renowned for their mercenaries, their perfumes, and he\nbelieved their jewelry.\nThe illusion rippled as Dalinar walked closer. A single person stood in\nfront of the pavilion. He wasn’t wearing the same clothing as the soldiers,\nand wasn’t holding a weapon.\n“We get down closer in a second, sir,” Sigzil said. “You should notice the\nperson out front.”\n“I see him,” Dalinar said, leaning forward.\nIndeed, the image soon drew closer to the pavilion, and the figure\nbecame more distinct. An older man. Didn’t seem Tukari, or Alethi. Yes …\nhe was probably Shin, which was what Wit had said Ishar would appear to\nbe. An older Shin man with a white beard and pale skin. Tukar was named\nafter Tuk, their word for the Herald Talenelat—but it wasn’t Taln who ruled\nthem. Not now. It was a different Herald.\nIshar wore simple robes, deep blue. He spread his hands out to the sides,\nfrost crystallizing on the stone around him, forming lines.\nA glyph. The symbol for mystery, a question.\nIt seemed directed at Dalinar specifically. This was absolutely the right\nman. Dalinar didn’t need to consult the drawings that Wit had provided.\nHe heard a hiss from beside him, and glanced with surprise to see that\nSzeth had left his post by the entrance to the tent. He’d joined Dalinar,\nstanding very close to the illusion.\n“One of my…” Szeth stopped himself, likely remembering that he wore\nthe image of an Alethi man. “Blood of my fathers,” he said instead, “that\nman is Shin?”\n“Rather,” Dalinar said, “he is from the people who long ago settled\nShinovar and became the Shin. The Heralds existed before our nationalities\nwere formed.”\nSzeth seemed transfixed, as if he’d never considered that one of the\nHeralds might be Shin. Dalinar understood; he’d seen many depictions of\nall ten Heralds, and they were usually all painted as Alethi.

The\nLightweaving disintegrated.\n“That’s all we saw, Brightlord,” Stargyle said. “I could show it again, if\nyou want.”\n“No need,” Dalinar said. “We’ve found him … and he’s waiting for me.”\n“Waiting for you, sir?” Sigzil asked, glancing toward Lyn and Leyten.\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “Do another scouting mission, and report back on\nwhat you find. I want to consult with Jasnah first—but we’re going to go\nmeet that man, Radiant Sigzil, and find out what he knows.”\nI had my title and my rhythms stripped from me for daring insist they\nshould not be killed, but should instead be reconditioned. Repurposed.\n—Musings of El, on the first of the Final Ten Days\nJasnah leaned back in her chair, lit by spherelight. The spanreed report had\njust arrived; today’s conflict with the enemy armies had ended. The\ncoalition forces had won. Emul was, essentially, now theirs.\nShe still ached from her part in earlier battles, though she’d sat this one\nout—Dalinar had been there, and they didn’t want to put both of them on\nthe same battlefield at once. Regardless, this particular offensive being\nfinished checked one thing off her list, but there was so much to do, still,\nwith Urithiru in enemy hands.\nHer house here in their command camp was far nicer than the one\nDalinar had picked for himself. She’d chosen it not for the luxury, or for the\nspace, but because it had a second floor. Locked away in a central room on\nthe second level—sharing no walls with the outside, alone save for Wit’s\ncompany—she could finally let herself relax. If a Shardbearer broke in, or if\na Skybreaker came through one of the upper windows, her fabrial traps\nwould go off—sounding the alarm and giving her time to fight or escape\ninto Shadesmar before she could be killed.\nShe had a boat waiting on the other side, as close to analogous to this\nlocation as Shadesmar would allow. She kept stores of Stormlight in the\npockets of her dressing gown, which she now wore. She would never again\nbe caught unaware. She would never again be left struggling in Shadesmar\nwithout proper resources, forced to spend weeks hunting a perpendicularity.\nIt was only with these preparations that Jasnah felt safe enough to let herself\nbecome frustrated.\nIn her lifetime studying history, Jasnah had been guided by two\nprinciples. First, that she must cut through the biases of the historians in\norder to understand the past. Second, that only in understanding the past\ncould she properly prepare for the future. She’d dedicated so much to this\nstudy. But a life’s work could be shaken when history got up and started\ntalking to you.\nShe leafed through papers more valuable than the purest emerald, filled\nwith her interviews with the Heralds Ash and Taln.

        "text": "with her interviews with the Heralds Ash and Taln. Living history. People\nwho had seen the events she’d read about. In essence, years of her life had\nbeen wasted. What good were her theories now? They were halfway-\nreliable re-creations of what might have happened, pieced together from\nfragments of different manuscripts.\nWell, now she could simply ask. The Challenge of Stormhold? Oh, Ash\nhad been there. King Iyalid had been drunk. The treaty of four nights? A\ndelaying tactic intended to position the enemy for a betrayal. All those\ndebates, and Jochi was right while Jasnah was wrong. Settled as easily as\nthat.\nOf course, there were things the Heralds didn’t know, things they\nwouldn’t say, or—in Taln’s case—things they couldn’t say. Jasnah flipped\nthrough the pages, trying to piece together anything from her more recent\ninterviews that would help with the situation at Urithiru. Even the Heralds\nknew little of this Sibling, the secretive tower spren.\nShe needed to present this to the other Veristitalians, see what they could\ntease from it all. Yet the words of the Heralds cast doubt on her second\nguiding principle—that the past was the best gauge of the future. There was\nanother way. The enemy could see what would happen in the future. That\nterrified her. In relying on the past, Jasnah saw the future through occluded\nglass from within a chasm, if at all. Odium had a prime spot atop the\nwatchtower.\nShe sighed, and Wit unfolded himself from the chair snug in the corner\non the other side of the room. He stretched, then wandered over and knelt\nbeside her before taking her unclothed safehand and kissing the tip of the\nindex finger.\nAt that, Jasnah felt a little thrill of mystery. She’d come to realize, early\nin her youth, that she didn’t approach relationships the same way everyone\nelse seemed to. Her partners in the past had always complained that she was\ntoo cold, so academic. That had frustrated her. How was she to learn what\nothers felt if she couldn’t ask them?\nShe didn’t have that problem with Wit. He presented an entire world of\nother problems, but he never was bothered by her questions. Even if he\noften dodged them.\n“My dear,” he said, “you pay me no heed. Be careful not to give undue\nattention only to the ravings of the mad. I warn you, without proper\naffection, your Wit will wilt.”\nShe removed her hand from his grip and studied him. Keen eyes. A nose\nthat was perhaps a bit too sharp. Most women, she suspected, would find\nhim physically attractive. And indeed she appreciated his statuesque quality,\nwith such interesting proportions and such an intense face. The nose\nhumanized him, in her opinion, made him feel more real.\nCuriously, he wasn’t Alethi, but he had transformed himself to look like\none. She’d been able to tease that much from him. He was something more\nancient. He’d laughed when she’d asked, and said the Alethi hadn’t existed\nwhen he’d been born, so he couldn’t have been credited the honor of being\none of her gifted people."

He’d laughed when she’d asked, and said the Alethi hadn’t existed\nwhen he’d been born, so he couldn’t have been credited the honor of being\none of her gifted people.\nShe found the way he spoke fascinating. After all this time—and all her\nworries—here was one who was her intellectual equal. Perhaps her\nsuperior. She didn’t trust him, of course. But that was part of what intrigued\nher.\n“How do we beat him, Wit?” she asked softly. “If he can truly see the\nfuture, then what possible chance do we have?”\n“I once knew a man,” Wit said, “who was the finest gambler in all his\nrealm. Where he lived, you make your cards walk themselves around the\ntable by breathing life into them. He was the best. Intelligent, skilled with\nthe Breath of life, a shrewd gambler—he knew exactly how to bet and\nwhen. Everyone was waiting for the day when he lost. And eventually he\ndid.”\n“That’s different, Wit,” Jasnah said. “He couldn’t literally see the\nfuture.”\n“Ah, but you see, I was rigging the games. So I did know the future—as\nmuch as Odium does, anyway. I shouldn’t have been able to lose. Yet I did.”\n“How?”\n“Someone else rigged the game so that no matter what move I made, I\ncould not win. The game was a tie, something I hadn’t anticipated. I’d\nfocused my cheating on making certain I didn’t lose, but I’d bet on myself\nwinning. And I bet it all, you see—if I’d have been more clever, I’d have let\nless be lost.”\n“So,” she said, “how do we set it up so Odium doesn’t win, even if he\ncan’t lose?”\nWit unfolded a paper from his pocket, still kneeling beside her. He\nseemed to genuinely like her, and she found his companionship\ninvigorating. Full of questions, delights, and surprises. She could provide\nthe intimacy he desired, though she knew he found her lack of excitement\non that axis odd, perhaps unsatisfying. That was not a new experience for\nher; she’d always found it curious how others put their physical urges ahead\nof the more powerful emotions of bonding, relating, and engaging.\nThe chance to scheme, to connect with a being like Wit—that was\nexciting. She was curious how the relationship would develop, and that\ninvigorated her. After so many failures, this was something new and\ninteresting.\nShe cupped his face with her hand. She wished she could, deep down,\ntruly trust him. He was something she, and this world, had never before\nknown. That was electrifying. It was also so extremely dangerous.\nWit smiled at her, then smoothed out the paper on her writing desk. It\nwas scribed in his own hand, of course. He came from a land where men\nhad been encouraged to write, the same as women. He shot her a glance,\nthen his smile became a grin. Yes, he did seem genuinely fond of their\nrelationship, as much as she was. Indeed, he said it had taken him by\nsurprise as it had her.\n“A contract,” she said, turning from him and reading the paper. “For\nDalinar’s contest with Odium.” Wit had undoubtedly sculpted each word"

        "text": "surprise as it had her.\n“A contract,” she said, turning from him and reading the paper. “For\nDalinar’s contest with Odium.” Wit had undoubtedly sculpted each word\nwith precision. “If Dalinar wins, Odium retreats to Damnation for a\nthousand years. If Odium wins, he must remain in the system, but gets\nRoshar to do with as he pleases. The monarchs will submit to his rule—as\nwill the Radiants who follow Dalinar.”\n“Perfect,” Wit said. “Wouldn’t you say?”\nJasnah sat back. “Perfect for you. If this is agreed to, you win no matter\nwhat. Odium remains contained in the Rosharan system either way.”\nWit spread his hands before himself. “I’ve learned a few things since that\nchallenge with the cards so many years ago. But Jasnah, this is for the best.\nIf Dalinar wins, well, your people get what they want. But if Dalinar loses,\nOdium is contained. We’re limiting our losses—making certain that at the\nboundaries of this planet, hell and hate must halt.”\n“It puts everything on this one contest of champions,” Jasnah said. “I\nhate that tradition even when played for lower stakes.”\n“Says the woman who used me in a ploy to manipulate that very\ntradition not two weeks ago.”\n“Lower stakes,” Jasnah repeated, “involving a meaningless loss such as\nyour death.”\n“Jasnah!”\n“Wit, you’re immortal,” she said. “You told me yourself.”\n“And you believed me?” he asked, aghast.\nShe paused and studied him.\nHe grinned, then kissed her hand again. He seemed to think that sort of\nthing would eventually spark passion in her. When in truth, physical\nstimulation was so inferior to mental stimulation.\n“I told you I haven’t died when killed—yet,” he said. “Doesn’t mean\nsomeone won’t find a way someday, and I’d rather not give them an\nopportunity. Besides, even for me, being killed can confound.”\n“Don’t distract me,” she said. “Can we really risk the fate of the world\non a simple duel?”\n“Ah, but it’s not a duel, Jasnah. That’s the thing. It’s not about the\ncontest, but what leads up to the contest. I know Rayse. He is arrogant and\nenjoys being worshipped. He never does anything without delighting in\nhow he can show off.\n“He’s also careful. Subtle. So to win, we need to make him certain he\ncan’t utterly lose. This contract does that. If his fail state is that he has to\nwait a thousand years to try again, well, that won’t bother him. He has been\nhere for thousands of years already. So he’ll see another thousand as an\nacceptable loss. But to you and the budding Radiants, a thousand years is a\nlong time. Long as a soulless star slumbers.”\n“A soulless star.”\n“Yes.”\n“Slumbers.”\n“As they do.”\nShe stared at him flatly.\n“Long as a rat rends rust?” he asked.\n“Long as seasons see stories?”\n“Oh, that’s delightful, Jasnah. Pretend I was the one who could somehow\nstress said symphonion sounds.”"

Indeedy.”\nJasnah sighed.\n“I’ll stop,” he said with a grin. “I promise. But look, Jasnah, Rayse—\nOdium—is someone we can defeat. If he has one great failing it’s that he\nthinks he’s smarter than he is. He tried exceptionally hard to make Dalinar\ninto his champion. Why? Because he doesn’t merely want to win, he wants\nto win in a way that says something. To everyone watching.\n“He was so certain he could turn the Blackthorn that he bet almost\neverything on that singular gamble. Now he must be scared. While he\npretends he has a dozen other plans, he’s scrambling to locate a champion\nwho can legitimately win. Because he knows—same as I’m telling you—\nthat the contest won’t only be about who can stab the hardest with their\nspear.”\n“What will it be about then?”\n“Same thing it’s always about, Jasnah,” Wit said. “The hearts of men and\nwomen. Do you trust the hearts of those who fight on your side?”\nShe paused, and hoped he didn’t read too much into it. Staring at the\ncontract, she couldn’t help but feel outmatched by all of this. She, who had\nbeen preparing for nearly two decades for these exact events, felt uncertain.\nDid she trust her own heart, when confronted with ancient troubles that had\nsurely defeated better women than her?\n“A wise answer,” Wit whispered.\n“I didn’t give one.”\n“A wise answer.” He squeezed her hand. “If you give Odium this\ncontract—and get me the assurance that he cannot break free of this\nplanetary system no matter what happens—then you won’t have to trust the\nhearts of mortals, Jasnah. Because you’ll have me. And everything I can\ngive you.”\n“You’ve told me he would destroy you if he found you.”\n“We’ll add a line to the contract,” Wit said, “naming me as a contractual\nliaison for Honor—whom Dalinar represents. This will protect me from\nOdium’s direct attacks for the life of the contract. He will have to abide by\nthose terms, as they are part of the promise Rayse made by taking up the\nShard of Odium. To fail that promise would give others an opening against\nhim, and said failures have killed gods before. Odium knows it. So do this,\nand I can help you openly. As myself.”\n“And who is that, Wit?” she asked. “Who are you really?”\n“Someone,” he said, “who wisely turned down the power the others all\ntook—and in so doing, gained freedoms they can never again have. I,\nJasnah, am someone who is not bound.”\nShe met his eyes—the eyes of something that wasn’t a man. A thing that"

Why? What\nwas happening? He grunted, thrashing in the darkness, and …\nHe started to remember.\nHe’d tied his hands together on purpose, to prevent him from punching\nsomeone who woke him, like he’d done to Dabbid yesterday. He gasped,\nfighting the terror as he huddled against the wall. Kaladin told himself the\nvisions were only nightmares, but he still wanted to claw at his own skull.\nBurrow into it, pull out all the terrible thoughts, the overwhelming\ndarkness. Storms. He was … he was …\nHe was so tired.\nEventually he managed to calm himself enough to free his hands. He\nsearched around the black chamber, but saw nothing. They hadn’t left out\nany lights. Teft, however, was snoring softly.\nEverything was all right. Kaladin was … was all right.…\nHe fumbled around his mat, looking for the canteen he’d placed there\nwhen going to sleep. What had awakened him? He remembered a … a\nsong. A distant song.\nHe found the canteen, but then saw a light on the wall. Faint, almost\ninvisible even in the darkness. Hesitant, he wiped the sweat from his brow,\nthen reached out and touched the garnet. A voice, so very quiet, spoke in his\nmind.\n… help … please …\nStorms. The tower spren sounded frail.\n“What is wrong? They found the last node?”\nYes … at … the model …\nThe model? Kaladin frowned, then remembered the large model of the\ntower in the infirmary room. In there? Near the Radiants?\nStorms. That was where his parents were.\nThere is something else … so … much … worse.…\n“What?” Kaladin demanded. “What could be worse?”\nThey will … soon kill … all the Radiants.…\n“The Radiants?” Kaladin said. “The captive ones?”\n… Please … send … me Rlain.…\nThe voice faded along with the light. Kaladin took a deep breath,\ntrembling. Could he do this again? He took out a sphere, then woke Teft.\nThe other bridgeman came awake, grabbing Kaladin by the arm\nreflexively. His grip was weak.

I’ll make a fuss outside to lure out the guards and distract the\nPursuer. If the guards don’t come out though, you’ll have to neutralize\nthem.”\n“All right then. Good enough.” Teft pointed to the side, to where\nsomething lay folded on the ground. Bridge Four uniforms. Kaladin had\nasked Dabbid to get them changes of clothing. That was what he’d found?\nAs they began to dress, Dabbid returned, frantic. He came up and grabbed\nKaladin’s arm.\n“The tower spren talked to you too?” Kaladin asked.\nDabbid nodded. “They sounded so weak.”\n“Do you know where Rlain is?” Kaladin asked.\n“I’m going to meet him,” Dabbid said. “Fourth floor. Something’s\nhappened with Venli that has him really shaken. He didn’t want to talk in\nthe infirmary.”\n“Tell him the plan is a go,” Kaladin said. “Someone needs to inform the\nqueen. Do you think you two can get to her?”\n“Rlain thinks he can,” Dabbid said. “I will go with him.

In an emergency, someone might have to jump out the\nwindow and hope to regain their powers before they hit the ground—but\nthat was an absolute last resort. The current plan was for the Windrunners to\nclimb down the outside, each with another Radiant strapped to their backs.\nIt was far from a perfect plan, but it was better than letting the Fused\nmurder the Radiants while they were in comas.\n“Even if you only get yourself out,” Kaladin said, “do it, rather than\nstaying and making a hopeless stand. Take your spren and get to Dalinar.”\n“And you?” Teft said. “You’ll follow, right?”\nKaladin hesitated.\n“If I run, you run,” Teft said. “Look, what happened the last two times a\nnode was discovered?”\n“The Pursuer was waiting for me,” Kaladin admitted.\n“He will be again,” Teft said. “This is a trap, plain and simple. What the\nenemy doesn’t know is that we don’t care about the node. We’re trying to\nfree the Radiants. So distract him a little, yes, but then run and let them\nhave their storming fabrial.”\n“I could try that.”\n“Give me an oath, lad. We can’t do anything more in this tower. We need\nto reach Dalinar. I’m going to head that way with as many Radiants as I can\nrescue. You’ve got my back, right?”\n“Always,” Kaladin said, nodding. “I swear it. Get as many of the\nRadiants out as you can, and then run. Once you do, I’ll follow.”\nI love their art. The way they depict us is divine, all red shades and\nblack lines. We appear demonic and fearsome; they project all fear\nand terror upon us.\n—Musings of El, on the first of the Final Ten Days\nDalinar stepped into the Prime’s warcamp home, and immediately felt as if\nhe’d entered the wrong building. Surely this was a storage room where they\nwere keeping extra furniture gathered from the surrounding abandoned\ntowns.\nBut no, Dalinar was merely accustomed to austerity. It was an Alethi\nwartime virtue for a commander to eschew comfort. Dalinar had perhaps\ntaken this idea too far on occasion—but he’d become comfortable with\nsimple furniture, bare walls. Even his rooms in Urithiru had grown too\ncluttered for his taste.\nYoung Yanagawn came from a different tradition. This entry room was\nso full of rich furniture—painted bronze on every surface that wasn’t of\nsome plush material—that it created a maze Dalinar had to wind through to\nreach the other side. Adding to the difficulty, the room was also packed with\na battalion’s worth of servants. Twice Dalinar encountered someone in\nbright Azish patterns who had to physically climb onto a couch to let him\npass.\nWhere had they found all of this? And those tapestries draping every\nvisible space on the walls. Had they carried them all this way? He knew the\nAzish were more accustomed to long supply chains—they didn’t have\naccess to the number of food-making Soulcasters that the Alethi did—but\nthis was excessive, wasn’t it?"

        "text": "Azish were more accustomed to long supply chains—they didn’t have\naccess to the number of food-making Soulcasters that the Alethi did—but\nthis was excessive, wasn’t it?\nThough, he noted, turning back across the room as he reached the other\nside, this would certainly slow an assassin or a force who tried to break in\nhere and attack the Prime.\nIn the next room he found an even greater oddity. The Prime—\nYanagawn the First, Emperor of Makabak—sat in a throne at the head of a\nlong table. Nobody else ate at the table, but it was stuffed with lit\ncandelabras and plates of food. Yanagawn was finishing his breakfast,\nmostly pre-cut fruit. He wore a mantle of heavy cloth and an ornate\nheaddress. He ate primly, spearing each bite of fruit with a long skewer,\nthen raising it to his lips. He barely seemed to move, with one hand held\ncrossed before his chest as he manipulated the skewer with the other.\nA large rank of people stood to either side of him. They mostly seemed\nto be camp followers. Washwomen. Wheelwrights. Reshi chull keepers.\nSeamstresses. Dalinar picked out only a few uniforms.\nJasnah had already arrived for the meeting. She stood among the groups\nof people, and a servant ushered Dalinar in that direction as well, so he\njoined the bizarre display. Standing and watching the emperor eat his fruit\none delicate bite at a time.\nDalinar liked the Azish—and they’d proven to be good allies with a\nshockingly effective military. But storms above and Damnation beyond,\nwere they strange. Although curiously, he found their excess to be less\nnauseating than when an Alethi highprince indulged. In Alethkar this would\nbe an expression of arrogance and a lack of self-restraint.\nHere, there was a certain … cohesion to the display. Alethi servants of\nthe highest order wore simple black and white, but the Azish ones were\ndressed almost as richly as the emperor. The overflowing table didn’t seem\nto be for Yanagawn. He was merely another ornament. This was about the\nposition of Prime, and the empire itself, more than an elevation of the\nindividual man.\nFrom what Dalinar had heard, they’d had trouble appointing this most\nrecent Prime. The reason for that was, of course, standing directly behind\nDalinar: Szeth, the Assassin in White, had killed the last two Primes. At the\nsame time, Dalinar couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to be Prime. They had\nto deal with all this pomp, always on display. Maybe that was why their\n“scholarly republic” worked in a way Jasnah liked so much. They had\naccidentally made the position of emperor so awful, no sane person would\nwant it—so they’d needed to find other ways to rule the country.\nDalinar had learned enough social grace to remain quiet until the display\nwas complete. Each of the onlookers was then given a bronze plate full of\nfood, which they accepted after bowing to the emperor. As they left one by\none, other servants quickly made space at the table for Jasnah and Dalinar,\nthough the clock he wore in his arm bracer told him he was still a few\nminutes early for the meeting."

Had him hopping about like the\nPrime. Though admittedly, Dalinar was realizing how much less of his time\nwas wasted now that everyone knew precisely when to meet together.\nWithout ever saying a word, Navani was bringing order to his life.\nBe safe. Please. My life’s light, my gemheart.\nHe sent Szeth out, as neither of the other two monarchs had guards in the\nroom. As they settled—the last of the observers leaving—Noura bowed to\nthe Prime, then took a seat at the table deliberately positioned to be lower\nthan the three of them. Some in the empire considered it a scandal that\nDalinar, Jasnah, and Fen were always seated at the same height as the\nPrime, but Yanagawn had insisted.\n“Dalinar, Jasnah,” the youth said, relaxing as he removed his headdress\nand set it onto the table. Noura gave him a glance at that, but Dalinar\nsmiled. She obviously thought the Prime should maintain decorum, but\nDalinar liked seeing the youth grow more comfortable with his position and\nhis fellow monarchs. “I’m sorry we didn’t have plates of food for you as\nwell,” Yanagawn continued in Azish. “I should have known you’d both\narrive early.”\n“It would have made a fine memento, Majesty,” Jasnah said, laying out\nsome papers on the table. “But we were not of the chosen today, so it\nwouldn’t feel right to be so favored.”\nThe boy looked to Noura. “I told you she understood.”\n“Your wisdom grows, Imperial Majesty,” the older woman said. She was\nan Azish vizier—a high-level civil servant. Her own outfit had less gold on\nit than the Prime’s, but it was nevertheless fantastically colored, with a cap\nand contrasting coat of a multitude of patterns and hues. Her long hair was\ngreying and wound into a braid that emerged from her cap on one side.\n“All right, Jasnah,” Yanagawn said, leaning forward to inspect Jasnah’s\npapers—though as far as Dalinar knew, he couldn’t read Alethi. “Tell it to\nme straight.”\nDalinar braced himself.\n“We have practically no chance of recovering Urithiru,” Jasnah said in\nAzish, her voice barely accented. “Our scouts confirm that fabrials don’t\nwork near it. That means if we were to re-create a smaller version of my\nmother’s flying machine to deliver troops, it would drop the moment it drew\ntoo close.\n“They’ve also blocked off the caverns. My uncle delivered a small force\nto the bottom, and that action seems to have informed the enemy that we\nknow their ruse is up. They are no longer sending fake messages via\nspanreed, and we’ve seen singer troops on the balconies.\n“With a Shardblade—which we discovered can be delivered into the\nprotected area so long as it is not bound—our troops can cut through the\nblockage at the bottom. But while doing that the force would be exposed to\narchers on higher ground. And if we made it through that rubble, fighting all"

And if we made it through that rubble, fighting all\nthe way up through a contested tunnel system would be a nightmare.\n“A march by soldiers along the tops of the mountains is impossible for a\nmultitude of reasons. But if we did reach the tower, we’d lose. Our\nbattlefields are a careful balance of Radiant against Fused, Shardbearer\nagainst Regal, soldier against soldier. At Urithiru, we’d have no Radiants—\nand the entire strategy would topple.”\n“We’d have Kaladin,” Dalinar said. “His powers still work. The\nStormfather thinks it’s because he’s far enough along in his oaths.”\n“With all due respect to him,” Jasnah said, “Kaladin is just one man—\nand one you relieved of duty before we left.”\nShe was correct, of course. Common sense dictated that one man was\nnothing against an army of Fused. Yet Dalinar wondered. Once, in the\nwarcamps, he’d argued with Kaladin’s soldiers who had set up a vigil for\nthe young Windrunner—then presumed dead. Dalinar had been proven\nwrong that time. Now, he found himself possessing some of the same faith\nas those soldiers.\nBeaten down, broken, surrounded by enemies, Kaladin continued to\nfight. He knew how to take the next step. They couldn’t leave him to take it\nalone.\n“Our best chance,” Dalinar said to the others, “is to deliver me and a\nforce through Shadesmar to the tower. I might be able to open a\nperpendicularity there, and we could surprise the enemy with an attack.”\n“You might be able to open one there, Uncle,” Jasnah said. “What does\nthe Stormfather think?”\n“He isn’t certain I am far enough along in my oaths or my skills to\nmanage it yet,” Dalinar admitted.\nJasnah tapped her notes. “An assault through Shadesmar would require a\nlarge number of ships—something we don’t have on that side, and which I\nsee no way of obtaining.”\n“We need to find a way to support Kaladin, Navani, and whatever\nresistance they are building,” Dalinar said. “We might not need a large force\nof ships. A small group of trained soldiers might be able to sneak in, then\ndisable the fabrial the enemy is using to stop Radiants.”\n“Undoubtedly,” Jasnah said, “that is the method the enemy used to get\ninto the tower. They will be guarding against this same tactic.”\n“So what?” Yanagawn said, chewing on some nuts he had hidden in a\npocket of his oversized robes. “Jasnah, you argue against every point\nDalinar makes. Are you saying we should give up Urithiru to the enemy?”\n“Our entire war effort falls apart without it,” Noura said. “It was the\nmeans by which we connected our disparate forces!”\n“Not necessarily,” Jasnah said, showing some small maps to the Prime.\n“As long as we have a stronger navy—and proper air support—we can\ncontrol the southern half of Roshar. It will necessitate weeks or months of\ntravel—but we can coordinate our battlefields as long as we have\nspanreeds.”\n“Still,” Yanagawn said, glancing at Noura. The older woman nodded in\nagreement."

The older woman nodded in\nagreement.\n“This is a major blow,” Dalinar said. “Jasnah, we can’t simply abandon\nUrithiru. You yourself spent years trying to locate it.”\n“I’m not suggesting we do, Uncle,” she said, her voice cold. “I’m merely\npresenting facts. For now, I think we need to act as if we will not soon\nretake the tower—which might mean moving against Ishar’s forces in\nTukar, so we can secure those positions. At any rate, we should be planning\nhow to support our forces in southern Alethkar against the Vedens.”\nThey were all valid points, the core of a cohesive and well-reasoned\nbattle strategy. She was trying hard, and mostly succeeding, at learning to\nbe a capable tactical commander. He couldn’t blame her for feeling she had\nsomething to prove there; her entire life had been a series of people\ndemanding she prove herself to them.\nHowever, her quickness to abandon Urithiru smelled too similar to what\nTaravangian had done in abandoning Roshar. Give up quickly, once you\nthink you’re beaten.\n“Jasnah,” he said, “we need to try harder to liberate Urithiru.”\n“I’m not saying we shouldn’t, only that such an action is going to be\nvery difficult and costly. I’m trying to outline those costs so we’re aware of\nthem.”\n“The way you talk lacks hope.”\n“‘Hope,’” she said, spreading her papers out on the table. “Have I ever\ntold you how much I dislike that word? Think of what it means, what it\nimplies. You have hope when you’re outnumbered. You have hope when\nyou lack options. Hope is always irrational, Uncle.”\n“Fortunately, we are not entirely rational beings.”\n“Nor should we want to be,” she agreed. “At the same time, how often\nhas ‘hope’ been the reason someone refuses to move on and accept a\nrealistic attitude? How often has ‘hope’ caused more pain or delayed\nhealing? How often has ‘hope’ prevented someone from standing up and\ndoing what needs to be done, because they cling to a wish for everything to\nbe different?”\n“I would say,” Yanagawn said, leaning forward, “that hope defines us,\nJasnah. Without it, we are not human.”\n“Perhaps you are correct,” Jasnah said, a phrase she often used when she\nwasn’t convinced—but also didn’t want to continue an argument. “Very\nwell then, let us discuss Urithiru.”\n“Your powers will work,” Dalinar said, “at least partially. You have said\nthe Fourth Ideal.”\n“Yes,” she said. “I have—though the Stormfather is uncertain whether\nthe fourth oath will truly allow a Radiant to withstand the suppression. Am I\ncorrect?”\n“You are,” Dalinar said. “But if the enemy is resupplying via the\nOathgates, there is only one way we can realistically do anything about this\nsituation. We must destroy their suppression fabrial. And so my suggestion\nof a small team makes the most sense.”\n“And you are to lead it?” Jasnah said.\n“Yes,” Dalinar said."

What if you can’t open a\nperpendicularity at Urithiru?”\n“I’ve been experimenting, practicing,” Dalinar said. “But yes, I’ve a long\nway to go. So I’ve been considering another solution.” He selected one of\nJasnah’s maps, then turned it for the others to see. “We came here to Emul\nto use a hammer-and-anvil tactic, shoving our enemy against an army here.\nThe army of Ishar, the being the Azish call Tashi.”\n“Yes, and?” Jasnah asked.\n“I have scouts surveying his position,” Dalinar said, “and have visual\nconfirmation—shown to me via Lightweaving—that the man himself is\nthere. Wit’s drawings confirm it. I have spoken with the Stormfather, and\nthe two of us think this is our best solution. Ishar is a master with the\nBondsmithing art. If I can recruit him, he could be the secret to saving\nUrithiru.”\n“Pardon,” Noura said. “But haven’t we determined that the Heralds are\nall … insane?” It was hard for her to say; their religion viewed the Heralds\nas deities. The Makabaki people worshipped them, and not the Almighty.\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, “but Ash indicates Ishar might have escaped with\nless damage than others. She trusts him.”\n“We’ve had letters from Ishar, Uncle,” Jasnah said. “That are not\nencouraging.”\n“I want to try speaking with him anyway,” Dalinar said. “We’ve been\nmostly ignoring his armies, other than to use them as our anvil. But if I\nwere to approach with a flag of peace and parley, Ishar—”\n“Wait,” Yanagawn said. “You’re going to go personally?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “I need to see Ishar, ask him questions.”\n“Send your Radiants,” Noura said. “Take this being captive. Bring him\nhere. Then talk to him.”\n“I would rather go myself,” Dalinar said.\n“But…” Yanagawn said, sounding utterly baffled. “You’re a king. This is\neven worse than when Jasnah went out in Plate and fought the enemy!”\n“It’s an old family tradition, Majesty,” Jasnah said. “We are prone to\nputting ourselves into the thick of things. I blame long-standing Alethi\nconditioning that says the best general is the one who leads the charge.”\n“I suppose,” Yanagawn said, “that a history of having excessive numbers\nof Shards might create a feeling of invincibility. But Dalinar, why do you\nraise this point now? To get our advice?”\n“More to warn you,” he said. “I’ve deliberately put the Mink in\ncommand of our military so I can step away to see to more … spiritual\nmatters. Jasnah and Wit are preparing a contract for me to present to\nOdium, once we have pushed him to come speak to me again.\n“Until we can make that work, I need to do something to help. I need to"

I need to\nbring Ishar to our side—then see if he can teach me how to restore the\nOathpact and help me rescue Urithiru.”\n“Well,” Yanagawn said, looking to Noura. “Being allies with the Alethi\nis … interesting. Go with Yaezir’s own speed then, I suppose.”\nYaezir is dead, Dalinar thought, though he didn’t say it.\nJasnah took the reins of the conversation next, explaining the contract\nshe was preparing for Odium. She and Dalinar had already talked to Queen\nFen earlier, via spanreed. Dalinar offered some explanations, but mostly let\nJasnah do the persuading. She had an uphill battle, as getting the monarchs\nto agree to this contest would take some doing.\nJasnah could manage it; he was confident in her. His job, he was\nincreasingly certain, involved his Bondsmithing, the Oathpact, and the\nHeralds.\nEventually the meeting came to an end. They agreed to meet again to\ntalk over more points in the contract, but for now Yanagawn had to attend\nsome religious ceremonies for his people. Dalinar needed to prepare for his\ntrip to Tukar; he intended to go as soon as was reasonable.\nAs they rose to leave, Yanagawn replaced his headdress. “Dalinar,” the\nyouth said, “do we know anything of Lift? We left her at the tower.”\n“Kaladin said the other Radiants were unconscious,” Dalinar said. “That\nprobably includes her.”\n“Maybe,” Yanagawn said. “She often does what she isn’t supposed to. If\nyou hear word, send to me, please?”\nDalinar nodded, joining Jasnah and withdrawing from Yanagawn’s\npalace. The exterior might look as ordinary as every other building in the\nvillage, but a palace it was.\nHe collected Szeth, who was holding something for him. Dalinar took\nthe large book—intimidating in size, though he knew it to be shorter than it\nappeared. The paper inside was covered with his own bulky letter-lines,\nlarger and thicker than was proper, drawn deliberately with his fat fingers.\nHe held the book toward Jasnah. He’d allowed early drafts and portions\nof it to be shared—and they’d gotten out all over the coalition by now.\nHowever, he hadn’t considered the book finished until he’d made some last\nchanges earlier this week.\n“Oathbringer?” she said, taking it eagerly. “It’s complete?”\n“No, but my part is done,” Dalinar said. “This is the original, though the\nscribes have made copies following my last round of alterations. I wanted\nyou to have the one I wrote.”\n“You should feel proud, Uncle. You make history with this volume.”\n“I fear you’ll find it to be mostly religious drivel.”\n“Ideas are not useless simply because they involve religious thinking,”\nJasnah said. “Nearly all of the ancient scholars I revere were religious, and I\nappreciate how their faith shaped them, even if I do not appreciate the faith\nitself.”\n“The things you said about hope in the meeting,” Dalinar said. “They"

But perhaps in a good way. Who in the world would\ndispute an idea as fundamental as hope? Yet because we all accept it as\nvital, we don’t think about it. What it really means. You do.”\n“I try,” she said, glancing back toward the Prime’s palace. “Tell me. Am\nI pushing too hard to establish myself as a military leader? I feel it’s an\nimportant precedent, as your book here is, but … I hit the target a little too\nsquarely, didn’t I?”\nDalinar smiled, then put his hand on hers, which held up the book. “We\nare revealing a new world, Jasnah, and the way before us is dark until we\nbring it light. We will be forgiven if we stumble on unseen ground now and\nthen.” He squeezed her hand. “I would like you to do something for me. All\nof the great philosophical texts I’ve read have an undertext.”\n“Yes, about that…” He wasn’t the only man who had been shaken to\ndiscover that for centuries, the women in their lives had been leaving\ncommentaries for one another. Something dictated by a man would often\nhave his wife’s or scribe’s thoughts underneath, never shared aloud. An\nentire world, hidden from those who thought they were ruling it.\n“I would like you to write the undertext for Oathbringer,” Dalinar said.\n“Openly. To be read and discovered by any who would like to read it.”\n“Uncle?” Jasnah said. “I’m not certain the tradition should continue. It\nwas questionable to begin with.”\n“I find the insights offered in the undertexts to be essential,” Dalinar\nsaid. “They change how I read. History is written by the victors, as many\nare fond of saying—but at least we have contrary insights by those who\nwatched. I would like to know what you think of what I’ve said.”\n“I will not hold back, Uncle,” Jasnah said. “If much of this is religious, I\nwill be compelled to be honest. I will point out your confirmation biases,\nyour fallacies. Perhaps it would be better if you gave the undertext task to\nmy mother.”\n“I considered that,” he said. “But I promised to unite instead of divide. I\ndon’t do that by giving my book only to those who agree with me.\n“If we’re revealing a new world, Jasnah, should we not do it together?\nArguments and all? I feel like … like we are never going to agree on the\ndetails, you and I. This book though—it could show that we agree on the\nmore important matters. After all, if an avowed atheist and a man starting\nhis own religion can unite, then who can object that their personal\ndifferences are too large to surmount?”\n“That’s what you’re doing, then?” she asked. “Creating a religion?”\n“Revising the old one, at the very least,” Dalinar said. “When the full\ntext of this is released … I suspect it will create a larger schism among\nVorinism.”\n“Me being involved won’t help that.”\n“I want your thoughts nonetheless.

Venli pulled her coat tight against\nthe wind. Listeners didn’t get as cold as humans seemed to, but she could\nstill feel the bite of the wind—particularly since this form had carapace\nonly as ornamentation, not true armor.\nShe wasn’t completely certain what to do after reaching Kholinar.\nRaboniel’s writ would certainly get her people out of the city, and even out\nof Alethkar. But Venli couldn’t wait the weeks or months it would take for\nthem to walk to the Shattered Plains. She had to find out if her mother was\nstill alive.\nHow far would the power of the writ go? Raboniel was feared, respected.\nCould Venli get her entire team of fifteen flown to that scout post via\nHeavenly One? Her mind spun with lies about a secret mission from\nRaboniel at the Shattered Plains. Indeed, it wasn’t too far from the truth.\nRaboniel had all but commanded her to go investigate the listener remnants.\nAnd what then? Venli thought. Raboniel knows about them. She knows\nI’m going. She’s manipulating me. For what end?\nIt didn’t matter. Venli had to go. It was time.\nTimbre pulsed softly as she stood in the line, map case over her shoulder,\ntrying to ignore the wind.\n“Are you disappointed in me?” Venli whispered to Conceit. “For leaving\nRlain and the humans?”\nTimbre pulsed. Yes, she was. The little spren was never afraid to be\nstraight with Venli.\n“What do you expect me to do?” she whispered, turning her head away\nfrom Dul so he wouldn’t hear her talking. “Help with their insane plan?"

The transfers\nshould be quick; they needed to exchange people and supplies before the\nhighstorm arrived.\nVenli told her people to wait, then stepped out of line. She marched to\nthe front, where a couple of singers—formerly Azish, by their clothing—\nwere arguing.\n“What is it?” Venli demanded to Craving.\nThe two took in her Regal form, then the femalen answered. “We have to\nwait to perform the exchange, Chosen,” she said, using an old formal singer\nterm. “The human who works the Oathgates for us has run off.”\n“No one else has a living Blade, which is needed to operate the fabrial\nnow,” the other explained. “If you could find the one they call Vyre, and ask\nwhen he will return…”\nVenli glanced toward the sky. She could feel the wind picking up. “The\nhighstorm is nearly here. We should move everyone inside.”\nThe two argued at first, but Venli spoke more firmly. Soon they started\nherding the frustrated singers toward the tower. Venli walked along the\nplateau, Timbre pulsing excitedly. She saw this as an opportunity.\n“Why do you believe in me?” Venli whispered. “I’ve given you no\nreason. I’ve ruined everything I’ve touched. I’m a selfish, impotent, sorry\nexcuse for a listener.”\nTimbre pulsed. Venli had saved her. Venli had saved Lift.\n“Yes, but I had to be coaxed into both,” Venli said. “I’m not a hero. I’m\nan accident.”\nTimbre was firm. Some people charged toward the goal, running for all\nthey had. Others stumbled. But it wasn’t the speed that mattered.\nIt was the direction they were going.\nVenli lingered at the entrance to Urithiru. She hesitated, glancing over\nher shoulder. The previous highstorm had reached all the way past the sixth\ntier. This one would likely envelop nearly the entire tower, a rare\noccurrence, their scholars thought. She felt as if she could sense the power\nof it, the fury bearing down on them.\n“What if,” she whispered to Timbre, “I offered to use this writ to\nsmuggle Stormblessed or his family out of Urithiru?”\nTimbre pulsed uncertainly.

But a few “random” humans?\nThat might work.\nShe found Dul and the others inside the front doors. Venli gathered them\naround, away from prying ears, and quickly handed her writ to Mazish.\n“Take this,” Venli said. “If I don’t return, you should be able to use it to get\naway.”\n“Without you?” Mazish said. “Venli…”\n“I’ll almost certainly return,” Venli said. “But just in case, take the map\ntoo.

This would\njeopardize their safety.\nInstead, as a group, they hummed to Consideration.\n“Having a Windrunner on our side could be useful,” Mazish said. “He\ncould certainly help us get to the Shattered Plains quicker.”\n“Yes!” said Shumin, the new recruit—still a little too eager for Venli’s\ntaste. “This is a great idea!”\n“Would he help us though?” Dul asked.\n“He treated Rlain well,” Mazish said. “Even when he thought Rlain was\nonly another parshman. I don’t like what the humans did, but if we put this\none in our debt, my gut says he won’t betray us.”\nVenli scanned the other faces. Singers with a variety of skin patterns,\nnow humming a variety of rhythms. None of them hummed to Betrayal, and\nthey gave her encouraging nods.\n“Very well,” Venli said, “wait for me until the storm has passed. If I’ve\nnot returned by then, take the next Oathgate transfer to Kholinar. I’ll find\nyou there.”\nThey hummed at her words, so Venli started toward the atrium, hoping\nshe’d be quick enough to stop Rlain from trying his desperate plan. She\ndidn’t know for certain if he’d take her offer. But this was the direction she\nshould be moving.\n* * *\nNavani knelt on the floor of her office. It still smelled of smoke from the\nexplosion the day before.\nDespite Raboniel saying she wanted to scrape the chamber for broken\npieces of the dagger, no one arrived to do that. They hadn’t taken her to her\nrooms above. They hadn’t brought her meals. They’d simply left her alone.\nTo contemplate her utter failure.\nShe felt numb. After her previous failure—when she’d exposed the node\nto her enemies—she’d picked herself up and moved on. This time she felt\nstuck. Worn. Like an old banner left too long exposed to the elements.\nRipped by storms. Bleached by the sun. Now hanging in tatters, waiting to\nslip off the pole.\nWe can kill Radiant spren."

        "text": "Ripped by storms. Bleached by the sun. Now hanging in tatters, waiting to\nslip off the pole.\nWe can kill Radiant spren.\nIn the end, all Raboniel’s talk of working together had been a lie. Of\ncourse it had. Navani had known it would be. She’d planned for it, and tried\nto hide what she knew. But had she really expected that to work? She’d\nrepeatedly confirmed to herself that she couldn’t outthink the Fused. They\nwere ancient, capable beyond mortal understanding, beings outside of time\nand … And …\nAnd she kept staring at the place where Raboniel’s daughter had died.\nWhere Raboniel had wept, holding the corpse of her child. Such a human\nmoment.\nNavani curled up on her pallet, though sleep had eluded her all night.\nShe had spent the hours listening to the Fused in the hallway playing notes\non metal plates and demanding new ones—until one final sound had echoed\nagainst the stone hallways. A chilling, awful sound that was wrong in all the\nright ways. Raboniel had found the tone.\nThe tone that could kill spren.\nShould Navani feel pride? Even in that time of near madness, her\nresearch had been so meticulous and well annotated that Raboniel was able\nto follow it. What had taken Navani days, the Fused replicated in hours,\nbreaking open a mystery that had stood for thousands of years. Evidence\nthat Navani was a true scholar after all?\nNo, she thought, staring at the ceiling. No, don’t you dare take that\ndistinction for yourself. If she’d been a scholar, she’d have understood the\nimplications of her work.\nShe was a child playing dress-up again. A farmer could stumble across a\nnew plant in the wilderness. Did that make him a botanist?\nShe eventually forced herself up to do the only thing she was certain she\ncouldn’t ruin. She found ink and paper in the wreckage of the room, then\nknelt and began to paint prayers. It was partially for the comfort of\nfamiliarity. But storm her, she still believed. Perhaps that was as foolish as\nthinking herself a scholar. Who did she think was listening? Was she only\npraying because she was afraid?\nYes, she thought, continuing to paint. I’m afraid. And I have to hope that\nsomeone, somewhere, is listening. That someone has a plan. That it all\nmatters somehow.\nJasnah took comfort in the idea that there was no plan, that everything\nwas random. She said that a chaotic universe meant the only actions of\nactual importance were the ones they decided were important. That gave\npeople autonomy.\nNavani loved her daughter, but couldn’t see it the same way.\nOrganization and order existed in the very way the world worked. From the\npatterns on leaves to the system of compounds and chemical reactions. It all\nwhispered to her.\nSomeone had known anti-Voidlight was possible.\nSomeone had known Navani would create it first.\nSomeone had seen all this, planned for it, and put her here. She had to\nbelieve that. She had to believe, therefore, that there was a way out.\nPlease, she prayed, painting the glyph for divine direction. Please. I’m\ntrying so hard to do what is right. Please guide me. What do I do?"

What do I do?\nA voice sounded outside the room, and in her sleep-deprived state, she\nfirst mistook it for a voice speaking to her in answer. And then … then she\nheard what it was saying.\n“The best way to distract the Bondsmith is to kill his wife,” the voice\nsaid. Rough, cold. “I am therefore here to perform the act that you have so\nfar refused to do.”\nNavani stood and walked to the door. Her femalen guard was someone\nnew, but she didn’t forbid Navani from peering down the hall toward\nRaboniel’s workstation beside the Sibling’s shield.\nA man in a black uniform stood before Raboniel. Neat, close-cropped\nblack hair, a narrow hawkish face with a prominent nose and sunken\ncheeks. Moash. The murderer.\n“I continue to have use for the queen,” Raboniel said.\n“My orders are from Odium himself,” Moash said. If a Fused’s voice\nwas overly ornamented with rhythms and meaning, his voice was the\nopposite. Dead. A voice like slate.\n“He ordered you to come to me, Vyre,” Raboniel said. “And I requested\nfor you to be sent. So today, I need you to deal with my problems first.\nThere is a worm in the tower. Eating his way through walls. He is\nincreasingly an issue.”\n“I warned you about Stormblessed,” Moash said. “I warned all of you.\nAnd you did not listen.”\n“You will kill him,” Raboniel said.\n“No enemy can kill Kaladin Stormblessed,” Moash said.\n“You promised that—”\n“No enemy can kill Stormblessed,” Moash said. “He is a force like the\nstorms, and you cannot kill the storms, Fused.”\nRaboniel handed Moash something. A small dagger. “You speak\nfoolishness. A man is merely a man, no matter how skilled. That dagger can\ndestroy his spren. Spread that sand, and it will turn faintly white when an\ninvisible spren flies overhead. Use it to locate his honorspren, then strike at\nit, depriving him of power.”\n“I can’t kill him,” Moash repeated a third time, tucking the dagger away.\n“But I promise something better. We make this a covenant, Fused: I ruin\nStormblessed, leave him unable to interfere, and you deliver me the queen.\nAccepted?”\nNavani felt herself grow cold. Raboniel didn’t even glance in her\ndirection. “Accepted,” Raboniel said. “But do another thing for me. The\nPursuer has been sent to destroy the final node, but I think he is delaying to\nencourage Stormblessed to show up and fight him for it. Break the node for\nme.”\nMoash nodded and accepted what seemed to be a small diagram\nexplaining the location of the node. He turned on his heel with military\nprecision and marched up the hallway. If he saw her, he made no comment,\npassing like a cold wind.\n“Monster,” Navani said, angerspren at her feet. “Traitor! You would\nattack your own friend?”"

Staring straight ahead, he spoke. “Where were you,\nlighteyes, when your son condemned innocents to death?” He turned,\naffixing Navani with those lifeless eyes. “Where were you, Queen, when\nyour son sent Roshone to Kaladin’s hometown? A political outcast, a known\nmurderer, exiled to a small village. Where he couldn’t do any damage,\nright?\n“Roshone killed Kaladin’s brother. You could have stopped it. If any of\nyou cared. You were never my queen; you are nothing to me. You are\nnothing to anyone. So don’t speak to me of treason or friendship. You have\nno idea what this day will cost me.”\nHe continued forward, bearing no visible weapon save the dagger tucked\ninto his belt. A dagger designed to kill a spren. A dagger that Navani had,\nessentially, created. He reached the end of the hallway, burst alight with\nStormlight—which somehow worked for him—and streaked into the air,\nrising through the open stairwell toward the ground floor.\nNavani slumped in the doorway, objections withering in her throat. She\nknew he was wrong, but she couldn’t find her voice. Something about that\nman unnerved her to the point of panic. He wasn’t human. He was a\nVoidbringer. If that word had ever applied to any, it was Moash.\n“What do you need?” her guard asked. “Have you been fed?”\n“I…” Navani licked her lips. “I need a candle, please. For burning\nprayers.”\nRemarkably, she fetched it. Taking the candle, shivering, Navani cupped\nthe flame and walked to her pallet. There, she knelt and began burning her\nglyphwards one at a time.\nIf there was a God, if the Almighty was still out there somewhere, had he\ncreated Moash? Why? Why bring such a thing into the world?\nPlease, she thought, begging as a ward shriveled, her prayers casting\nsmoke into the air. Please. Tell me what to do. Show me something. Let me\nknow you’re there.\nAs the last prayer drifted toward the Tranquiline Halls, she sat back on\nher heels, numb, wanting to huddle down and forget about her problems.\nWhen she moved to do so, however, in the candlelight she caught sight of\nsomething glittering amid the wreckage of her desk. As if in a trance,\nNavani rose and walked over. The guard wasn’t looking.\nNavani brushed aside ash to find a metal dagger with a diamond affixed\nto the pommel. She stared at it, confused. It had exploded, hadn’t it?\nNo, this is the second one. The one Raboniel used to kill her daughter.\nShe tossed it aside, as if hating it, once the deed was done.\nA precious, priceless weapon, and the Fused had discarded it. How long\nhad Raboniel been awake? Did she feel like Navani, exhausted, pushed to\nthe limit? Forgetting important details?\nFor there, glimmering violet-black in the gemstone, was a soft glow. Not\ncompletely used up in the previous killing."

Not\ncompletely used up in the previous killing.\nA small charge of anti-Voidlight.\n* * *\nKaladin took the steps down one at a time. Unhurried as he walked toward\nthe trap.\nA certain momentum pushed him forward. As if his next actions were\nSoulcast into stone, already unchangeable. A mountain seemed to fill in\nbehind him, blocking his retreat.\nForward. Only forward. One step after another.\nHe emerged from the stairwell onto the ground floor. Two direform\nRegals had been guarding the path, but they backed off—hands on swords,\nhumming frantically. Kaladin ignored them, turning toward the atrium. He\nset his spear to his shoulder and strode through this central corridor.\nNo more hiding. He was too tired to hide. Too wrung-out for tactics and\nstrategy. The Pursuer wanted him? Well, he would have Kaladin, presented\nas he had always been seen. Dressed in his uniform, striding to the fight, his\nhead high.\nHumans and singers alike scattered before him. Kaladin saw many of the\nhumans wearing the markings Rlain had described—shash glyphs drawn on\ntheir foreheads. Storm them, they believed in him. They wore the symbol of\nhis shame, his failure, and his imprisonment. And they made it something\nbetter.\nHe couldn’t help feeling that this was it. The last time he’d wear the\nuniform, his final act as a member of Bridge Four. One way or another, he\nhad to move on from the life he’d been clinging to and the simple squad of\nsoldiers who had formed the heart of that life.\nAll these people believed in a version of him who had already died.\nHighmarshal Kaladin Stormblessed. The valiant soldier, leader of the\nWindrunners, stalwart and unwavering. Like Kal the innocent youth,\nSquadleader Kaladin the soldier in Amaram’s army, and Kaladin the\nslave … Highmarshal Stormblessed had passed. Kaladin had become\nsomeone new, someone who could not measure up to the legend.\nBut with all these people believing in him—falling in behind him,\nwhispering with hope and anticipation—perhaps he could resurrect\nStormblessed for one last battle.\nHe didn’t worry about exposing himself. There was nowhere to run.\nRegals and singer soldiers gathered in bunches, tailing him and whispering\nharshly, but they would let a Fused deal with a Radiant.\nOther Fused would know, though. Kaladin had been claimed already. He\nwas Pursued.\nAs Kaladin drew near to the Breakaway—the hallway to his right would\nmerge with the large open marketplace—he finally felt her. He stopped fast,\nlooking that direction. The dozens of people following him hushed as he\nstared intently and raised his right hand in the direction of the market.\nSyl, he thought. I’m here. Find me.\nA line of light, barely visible, bounced around in the distance. It turned\nand spun toward him, picking up speed—its path growing straighter.

That felt … felt like it did when I nearly\ndied. Like it did when I drifted for centuries. I feel sad, Kaladin. And cold.”\n“I understand those feelings,” he replied. “But the enemy, Syl … they’re\ngoing to execute the Radiants. And they might have my parents.”\nShe peered up at him. Then her shape fuzzed, and she was instantly in a\nuniform like his, colored Kholin blue.\nKaladin nodded, then turned and continued, shadowed by the hopes and\nprayers of hundreds. Shadowed by his own reputation. A man who would\nnever cry in the night, huddled against the wall, terrified. A man he was\ndetermined to pretend to be. One last time.\nHe checked Navani’s flying gauntlet, which he’d attached to his belt—\neasy to unhook, if needed—at his right side so it pointed behind him.\nKaladin and Dabbid had reset its conjoined weights the other night. It\nhadn’t worked so well for him in the previous fight, but now he understood\nits limitations. It was a device designed by engineers, not soldiers. He\ncouldn’t wear it on his hand, where it would interfere with his ability to\nhold a spear. But perhaps it could offer him an edge in another capacity.\nWith Syl flying as a ribbon of light beside his head, he strode into the\natrium—with that endless wall of glass rising as a window in front of him.\nAn equally endless hollow shaft in the stone rose up toward the pinnacle of\nthe tower, surrounded by balconies on most levels. Heavenly Ones hovered\nin the air, though he didn’t have time to search for Leshwi.\nSyl moved out in front of him, then paused, hovering, seeming curious.\n“What?” he asked.\nHighstorm coming, she said in his head.\nOf course there was. It was that kind of day.\nPeople in the atrium began to scatter as they saw him, accompanied by\nanticipationspren. As the place emptied, he picked out a hulking figure\nstanding in the dead center of the chamber, blocking the way to the room on\nthe other side—the infirmary.\nKaladin brandished his spear in challenge. But the Pursuer cared nothing\nfor honor. He was here for the kill, and he came streaking at Kaladin to\nclaim it.\nWatch them struggle.

But storms, it was hard not to feel\ninspired at the sight of Kaladin framed in the entryway like that in a sharp\nblue uniform, his hair free, his scars bold and stark on his forehead. Eyes\nintense enough to pierce the darkest storm.\nYou did good with that one, Teft, he thought—giving himself permission\nto feel a little pride. You ruined your own life something fierce, but you did\ngood with that one.\nPhendorana whispered comfort in his ear. She’d shrunk, at his request,\nand rode on his shoulder. He nodded at the words. If his family hadn’t\ngotten involved with the Envisagers, he wouldn’t have known how to help\nKaladin when he’d needed it. And then the Blackthorn probably would have\ndied, and they wouldn’t have found this tower. So … maybe it was time to\nlet go of what he’d done.\nTogether, they inched along the wall toward the infirmary.

She also refused to accept his excuses. Which\nmade them an even better match.\nKaladin started fighting, and Teft couldn’t spare him much more than a\nwish of goodwill. The lad would be fine. Teft simply had to do his part.\nThey waited to see if the guards in the infirmary came out at the ruckus,\nand blessedly they did. Unfortunately, one remained at the door, gaping at\nthe battle but apparently determined to remain at his post.\nStormform Regal too, which was just Teft’s luck.

The Regal’s powers sent another shock\nthrough Teft, but in the confusion, Teft was able to get him to the ground\nand put him in a deadman’s hold.\nLift shut the door with a click. She waited, anxious, as Teft struggled to\nkeep pressure on the creature’s throat. He pulled in all the Stormlight he\nhad, but felt the stormform’s power growing—the creature’s skin crackling\nwith red lightning.\n“Healing!” Teft said.\nLift leapt over and pressed her hand against his leg as the stormform\nreleased a bolt of power straight through Teft into the floor. The crack it\nmade was incredible. Teft felt a burning pain, like someone had decided to\nuse his stomach as a convenient place to build their firepit.\nBut he held on, and Lift healed him. He even managed to roll to the side\nand use Stormlight to stick the Regal to the ground. That let him keep the\npressure on and resist the shocks that followed—less powerful than the first.\nFinally the Regal went limp, unconscious. Teft huffed and stood, though\nhe first had to unstick his clothing from the floor. Storming Stormlight. He\nlooked down and found the front of his shirt had been burned clean through.\nHe glanced to Phendorana, who had grown to full size. She folded her\narms thoughtfully.\n“What?” he asked.\n“Your hair is standing up,” she said, then grinned. She looked like a little\nkid when she did that, and he couldn’t help returning the expression.\n“Move!” she said to him. “Seal the door!”\n“Right, right.” He stepped over and infused the doorframe with\nStormlight. Someone would have heard that lightning bolt. “Lift,” he\nshouted as he worked, “get to it! I want these Radiants up and taking orders\nfaster than an arrow falls.” He glanced to Phendorana, standing beside him\nand meeting his eyes. “We can do this. Get them up, grab Kal’s family, get\nout.”\n“Through the window?” she asked.\nOutside the east-facing window was a sheer drop of hundreds of feet. He\nfelt moderately good about his ability to climb down it. How far would\neveryone have to get before their Radiant powers returned? He feared the\nHeavenly Ones would find out before then and come after them.\nWell, he’d see what the others said, once they were awake.

She nearly managed to get away, but the Blade caught her in the thighs,\ncutting with the grace of an eel through the air.\nLift collapsed, her legs ruined by the Blade.\nThe figure in the black uniform turned from Lift and—blazing with\nStormlight—focused on Teft.

That was one husk spent. The\nPursuer had two others before he would be trapped in his form and had to\neither flee, or face Kaladin and risk dying.\nKaladin stepped directly into the Pursuer’s path and dropped his spear,\nwillingly entering the grapple. Turning at the last moment, he caught the\nPursuer’s hands as they reached for him. Thrumming with Stormlight,\nKaladin held the Pursuer’s wrists. Storms, the creature was stronger than he\nwas. But Kaladin wouldn’t run or hide. Not this time. This time he only had\nto give Teft and Lift enough space to work.\nAnd Kaladin had discovered something during their last fight. This\ncreature was not a soldier.\n“Give in, little man,” the Pursuer said. “I am as unavoidable as the\ncoming storm. I will chase you forever.”\n“Good,” Kaladin said.\n“Bravado!” the Pursuer said, laughing. He managed to hook Kaladin’s\nfoot, then used his superior strength to shove Kaladin to the ground. Best\nKaladin could do was hang on and pull him down as well. The Pursuer\nkneed Kaladin in the gut, then twisted to get him in a hold. “So foolish!”\nKaladin writhed, barely able to keep from being immobilized. Syl flitted\naround them. As the Pursuer tried for a lock, Kaladin twisted around and\nmet the Pursuer’s eyes, then smiled.\nThe Pursuer growled and repositioned to press Kaladin against the\nground by his shoulders.\n“I’m not afraid of you,” Kaladin said. “But you’re going to be afraid of\nme.”\n“Madness,” the Pursuer said. “Your inevitable fate has caused madness\nin your frail mind.”\nKaladin grunted, back to the cold stone, using both hands to push the\nPursuer’s right hand away. He kept his eyes locked on to the Pursuer’s.\n“I killed you,” Kaladin said. “And I’ll kill you now. Then every time you\nreturn for me, I’ll kill you again.”\n“I’m immortal,” the Pursuer growled. But his rhythm had changed. Not\nso confident.\n“Doesn’t matter,” Kaladin said. “I’ve heard what people say about you.\nYour life isn’t the blood in your veins, but the legend you live. Each death"

It was in here, with a much\ndeadlier foe: a man who had been trained for war by Kaladin himself.\n“Hello, Teft,” Moash said softly, landing in front of the rows of\nunconscious people on the floor. “How are the men?”\n“Safe from you,” Teft said, pushing aside his cloak and unsheathing the\nlong knife he had hidden underneath. Couldn’t move through a crowd\nunseen with a spear, unfortunately.\n“Not all of them, Teft,” Moash said. There was a shadow on his face,\ndespite the room’s many lit spheres.\nMoash lunged forward and Teft danced back, stepping carefully over the\nbody of the unconscious Regal. He had space here in front of the door with\nno fallen Radiants to upset his footing. All Moash did at first was open a\nsack and throw something out across the floor nearby. Black sand? What on\nRoshar?\nTeft held out his weapon, Phendorana at his side, but the knife seemed\ntiny compared to Moash’s weapon: the assassin’s Honorblade.

The two of them\nwere in a nondescript passage of Urithiru, close to the steps down to the\nbasement. This was the last guard post, and Rlain thought they had made it\npast.\n“We’re delivering water,” Rlain said to Consolation, tapping his small\nwater barrel. He wore makeup covering his tattoo, blending it into his skin\npattern. “To the scholars.”\n“Why are you doing it?” the singer said. Not a Fused or Regal, merely an\nordinary guard. She walked over and put a hand on Rlain’s shoulder. “Let\nthe human do that kind of work, friend. You are meant for greater things.”\nHe glanced at Dabbid—who looked at the ground—and attuned\nIrritation. This wasn’t the kind of resistance he’d anticipated.\n“It’s my job,” Rlain said to the guard.\n“Who assigned axehounds’ work to a singer?” she demanded. “Come\nwith me. You strike an imposing figure in warform. I’ll teach you the sword.\nWe’re recruiting for our squad.”\n“I … I would rather do what I’m supposed to,” he said to Consolation.\nHe pulled free, and thankfully she let him go. He and Dabbid continued\nalong the hallway.\n“Can you believe it?” she said from behind. “How can so many keep on\nthinking like slaves? It’s sad.”\n“Yeah,” one of the other guards said. “I wouldn’t expect it of that one\nmost of all, considering.”\nRlain attuned Anxiety.\n“That one?” the femalen said, her voice echoing in the hallway.\n“Yeah, he’s that listener, isn’t he? The one that was in prison until\nRaboniel’s Voice pulled him out?”\nDamnation. Rlain walked a little quicker, but it was no use, as he soon\nheard boots chasing him. The guard grabbed him by the elbow.\n“Wait now,” she said. “You’re the listener?”\n“I am,” Rlain said to Consolation.\n“Delivering water. You. A traitor?”\n“We’re not…” He attuned Determination and turned around. “We’re not\ntraitors. Venli is Raboniel’s Voice.”\n“Yeah,” the femalen said. “Well, you’re not going down where the\nhuman queen is, not until I get confirmation that you’re allowed. Come with\nme.”\nDabbid pulled in closer to Rlain, trembling. Rlain looked toward the\nsinger guards. Four of them.\nNo. He wasn’t going to fight them. And not only because of the numbers.\n“Fine,” he said. “Let’s ask your superior, so I can get on with my duty.”\nThey pulled him away, and Dabbid followed, whimpering softly as they\nwere led—step by step—farther from their goal. Well, if the Sibling wanted\nhim down there for some reason, they’d have to find a way to get him out of\nthis.\n* * *\nThe Pursuer lunged for Kaladin. Kaladin, however, was ready.

That tugged Kaladin\nbackward faster than a man could leap, and so he stayed out of the\nPursuer’s grip.\nBy this point, the singers had cleared most of the atrium of civilians.\nThey’d lined the walls with soldiers—but not the flat side of the room with\nthe window—though crowds continued to watch from the hallways and the\nbalconies. Trusting in Kaladin.\nHeavenly Ones hovered above the circular chamber, as if to judge the\ncontest. In effect it was an arena. Kaladin projected as much strength and\nconfidence as he could. He almost started to feel it, the worn-out, weathered\nfatigue retreating.\nHe needed the Pursuer to believe. To understand. That he had far more to\nlose from this contest than Kaladin did.\nAnd he seemed to. For as Kaladin reached the other side of the room and\ndisengaged Navani’s device, the creature ejected his second body and shot\ntoward Kaladin as a ribbon. He wanted to end this battle quickly.\nThe window had darkened from the approaching stormwall, which\nannounced the highstorm. It hit with a fury that Kaladin could barely hear,\nand spheres became the room’s only source of light.\nKaladin seized the Fused out of the air as he formed, and they clashed\nagain. That was the Pursuer’s third body. If he ejected this time, he’d have\nto go recharge, or risk forming a fourth body—and being killed.\nThey went to ground again, rolling as they wrestled, Kaladin trying to\nmaneuver his knife. The Pursuer could heal with Voidlight, but the more of\nthat he lost, the more likely he’d have to retreat.\nThis time the creature offered no taunts as he tried to get a grip on\nKaladin’s head. Likely to smash it into the ground, as he knew Kaladin’s\nhealing wasn’t working properly. That gave Kaladin a chance to stab\nupward, forcing the Pursuer to grab his arm instead.\n“You’re no soldier,” Kaladin said loudly, his voice echoing to all of those\nlistening. “That’s what I realized about you, Defeated One. You’ve never\nfaced death.”\n“Silence,” the Pursuer growled, twisting Kaladin’s wrist.\nKaladin grunted, then rolled them both to the side, narrowly protecting\nhis wrist from serious damage. He dropped the knife. Fortunately, he had\nfound others.\n“I’ve faced it every day of my life!” Kaladin shouted, rolling on top of\nthe Fused. “You wonder why I don’t fear you? I’ve lived with the\nknowledge that death is hounding me. You’re nothing new.”\n“Be. QUIET!”\n“But I’m something you have never known,” Kaladin shouted, slamming\nthe Pursuer down by his shoulders. “Thousands of years of life can’t\nprepare you for something you’ve never met before, Defeated One! It can’t\nprepare you for someone who does not fear you!”\nKaladin pulled out his boot knife and raised it. The Pursuer, seeing that\ncoming, didn’t do what he should have. He didn’t try to grapple or knee\nKaladin’s stomach. He panicked and shot away as a ribbon of light, fleeing.\nHe materialized a short distance away in front of the watching soldiers."

The one he was vulnerable in. He turned to\nlook back at Kaladin, now standing atop his husk.\n“I am death itself, Defeated One,” Kaladin said. “And I’ve finally caught\nup to you.”\n* * *\nVenli found a mob of people blocking the central corridor as she tried to\nreach the atrium. She attuned Anxiety and pushed through the press. Since\nshe was a Regal, people did make way. Eventually she reached the front of\nthe crowd, where a group of warforms stood in a line, blocking the way\nforward.\nShe suspected she knew what was happening. Rlain and his friends had\nalready begun their rescue plan. She was too late.\n“Make room,” Venli demanded to Derision. “What is happening?”\nOne of the warforms turned. Venli didn’t know him personally, but he\nwas one of the Pursuer’s soldiers. “Our master is fighting Stormblessed,” he\nsaid. “We’re to keep a perimeter, prevent people from interfering.”\nVenli craned her neck, tall enough to see that the room was being\nguarded by about a hundred of the Pursuer’s troops, though she also saw\nsome of Raboniel’s personal guard—which she’d picked up from Leshwi.\nVenli attuned the Terrors. What now? Could she help? She found, as she\nsearched, that she genuinely wanted to. Not because Timbre was pushing\nher, and not because this was merely the path she was on. But because of\nthe songs of the stones. And the whispers of those who had come before\nher.\n“I’m the Voice of the Lady of Wishes,” Venli said. “You think that your\nblockade applies to me? Step aside.”\nReluctantly, the soldiers made way for her. And once she had a clear\nview, she couldn’t help but pause. There was something about the way\nStormblessed fought. Even grappling with the Pursuer, rolling across the\nground, there was a certain determination to him. He freed himself from the\ngrapple, then somehow leaped back twenty feet, though his powers\nshouldn’t have been working that well.\nThe Pursuer became a ribbon and chased him, but Stormblessed didn’t\nrun. He reached out and seized the Pursuer right as he appeared.\nFascinating. She could see why Leshwi found the human so interesting.\nThere was nothing Venli could do about this battle. She had to think\nabout Rlain, and Lirin and his family. She searched the air and located\nLeshwi hovering nearby.\nVenli made her way over to Leshwi as Stormblessed stood tall atop the\nPursuer’s husk. The lady floated down. She would not interfere in a duel\nsuch as this.\n“This looks bad for Stormblessed,” Venli whispered.\n“No,” Leshwi said to Exultation. “The Pursuer has used all of his husks.\nHe will need to flee and renew.”\n“Why doesn’t he?” Venli asked.\n“Look,” Leshwi said, and pointed at the silent atrium.

A perimeter of\nsoldiers with humans crowded behind them, peeking through. Fused in the\nair. All staring at the two combatants.\nAn incredible soldier, who seemed immortal and impervious, completely\nin control.\nAnd a Fused, who somehow looked small by comparison.\n* * *\nTeft dodged through the infirmary. He didn’t dare engage Moash directly;\ninstead he tried to stay out of reach. Buying time. For what though?\nMoash drifted closer to them, eyes glowing.\n“Stormblessed isn’t going to come in and help, is he?” Phendorana asked\nsoftly, floating beside Teft.\n“Kaladin can’t be everywhere at once,” Teft said. “He’s just one man,\nthough he often forgets that.” He jumped backward over a body. Lift had\nstirred, and was quietly pulling herself across the ground toward one of the\nnearby Radiants, her legs dragging behind.\nGood girl, Teft thought. He needed to keep Moash’s attention.\n“Never known a man to turn traitor as hard as you did,” Teft called to\nMoash. “What was it that got you? What made you willing to kill your\nown?”\n“Peace,” Moash said, halting in the middle of the room. “It was peace,\nTeft.”\n“This is peace?” Teft said, gesturing. “Fighting your friends?”\n“We’re not fighting. You run like a coward.”\n“Every good sergeant is a coward! And proud of it! Someone needs to\ntalk sense to the officers!”\nMoash hovered in place, a black stain in the air. Before he could look\nand see Lift, Phendorana appeared to him, standing a short distance away.\nMoash glanced toward her sharply. Good, good. Distraction.\nMoash, however, casually turned and slashed his Shardblade through the\nface of a Radiant beneath him. The unconscious woman’s eyes burned and\nLift cried out in horror, heaving herself forward to reach the body—as if she\ncould do anything.\nMoash glanced at Teft, then raised his Blade toward Lift.\n“Fine!” Teft said, striding forward. “Bastard! You want me? Fine! Fight\nme! I’ll show you who the better man is!”\nMoash landed beside the body and walked straight toward Teft. “We\nboth know who the better warrior is, Teft.”\n“I didn’t say better warrior, you idiot,” Teft said, lunging in with his\nknife. The stab was a feint, but Moash knew it. He sidestepped at precisely\nthe right time, and tripped Teft as he tried to turn and swing again.\nTeft went down with a grunt. He tried to roll, but Moash landed and\nkicked him in the side, hard. Something crunched in Teft’s chest. A wound\nthat blossomed with pain and didn’t heal, despite his Stormlight.\nMoash loomed overhead and raised his Blade, then swung it down\nwithout further comment. Teft dropped his knife—useless against a Blade—\nand raised his hands. He felt something from Phendorana. A harmony\nbetween them."

Teft was forgiven and he was close.\nMoash’s Shardblade met something in the air—a phantom spear shaft,\nbarely coalescing between Teft’s hands—and stopped. It threw sparks, but it\nstopped. Teft gritted his teeth and held on as Moash finally showed an\nemotion. Surprise. He stumbled back, his eyes wide.\nTeft let go, and Phendorana appeared beside him on the ground, puffing\nfrom exertion. He felt sweat trickling down his brow. Manifesting her like\nthat—even a little—had been like trying to push an axehound through a\nkeyhole. He wasn’t certain he, or she, could do it a second time.\nBest to try something else. Teft held his side, grimacing as he forced\nhimself into a kneeling position. “All right, lad. I’m done. You got me. I\nsurrender. Let’s wait for Kaladin to show up, and you can continue this\nconversation with him.”\n“I’m not here for Kaladin, Teft,” Moash said softly. “And I’m not here\nfor your surrender.”\nTeft steeled himself. Grapple him, he thought. Make that Blade a\nliability, too big to use. His best hope.\nBecause Teft did have hope. That was what he’d recovered, these years\nin Bridge Four. The moss might take him again, but if it did … well, he\nwould fight back again. The past could rot.\nTeft, Windrunner, had hope.\nHe managed to get to his feet, prepared for Moash to lunge at him—but\nwhen Moash moved, it wasn’t toward Teft. It was toward Phendorana.\nWhat? Teft stood stunned as Moash pulled a strange dagger from his belt\nand slammed it down—right where Phendorana was kneeling.\nShe looked up with surprise and took the knife straight in the forehead.\nThen she screamed.\nTeft leaped for her, howling, watching in horror as she shrank, writhing\nas Moash’s dagger pinned her to the floor. Her essence burned, flaring\noutward like an explosion.\nSomething ripped inside Teft. Something deeper than his own heart. A\npart of his soul, his being, was torn away. He collapsed immediately, falling\nnear the white spot in the sand that was all that remained of Phendorana.\nNo. No …\nIt hurt so much. Agony like a sudden terrible stillness. Nothingness.\nEmptiness.\nIt … it can’t be.…\nMoash tucked the dagger away methodically. “I can’t feel sorrow\nanymore, Teft. For that I am grateful.”\nMoash turned Teft over with his foot. His broken ribs screamed, but felt\nlike such an insignificant pain now.\n“But you know what?” Moash said, standing over him. “There was\nalways a part of me that resented how you were so eager to follow him.\nRight from the start, his little axehound. Licking his feet. He loves you. I\nthought I’d have to use his father. But I am … satisfied to have found\nsomething better.”\n“You are a monster,” Teft whispered."

I am merely silence. The quiet that eventually takes\nall men.”\n“Tell yourself that lie, Moash,” Teft growled, gripping the hand that held\nhim, his own hand clawlike from the horrible pain. “But know this.

Flashing lightning, a swirling\ntempest, power raw and unchained.\nKaladin stepped off the Pursuer’s decaying husk and walked forward.\nToward the enemy.\nThe Pursuer searched around, likely realizing how large his audience\nwas. Hundreds watching. He lived by lore, by reputation. He always killed\nanyone who killed him. He won each conflict eventually.\nNow he saw that crumbling. Kaladin could hear it in the increasingly\npanicked rhythm the Pursuer hummed. Saw it in his eyes.\n“Run,” Kaladin told him. “Flee. I’ll chase you. I will never stop. I am\neternal. I am the storm.”\nThe Pursuer stumbled back, but then encountered his soldiers holding\nthe perimeter, humming an encouraging rhythm. Behind them humans\ngawked, their foreheads painted.\n“Has it been long enough, do you think?” Syl whispered. “Are the others\nfree?”\n“Hopefully,” Kaladin said. “But I don’t think they’ll be able to escape\ninto that highstorm.”\n“Then they’ll have to come out here, and we’ll have to push for the\ncrystal pillar room,” she said, looking toward the infirmary. “Why haven’t\nthey appeared yet?”\n“Once we defeat the Pursuer—when he breaks and runs—we’ll find\nout,” Kaladin said, unhooking Navani’s device from his waist.\n“Something’s wrong,” she said softly. “Something dark…”\nKaladin stepped to the very center of the atrium, marked by a swirling\npattern of strata. He pointed his knife at the Pursuer. “Last body,” Kaladin\ncalled. “Come fight, and we’ll see who dies. We’ll see if your reputation\nsurvives the hour.”\nThe Pursuer, to his credit, came charging in. As he arrived, grabbing\nKaladin, Kaladin pressed Navani’s device against the Pursuer’s chest and\nLashed the bar down, binding it in place.\nIt launched backward, carrying the Pursuer with it.

More blood dripped from the cracked\ncarapace at his chest.\nKaladin stalked toward him, holding the knife. “Flee.”\nThe Pursuer’s eyes widened and he stepped to the side, toward his\nsoldiers.\n“Flee!” Kaladin said.\nThe creature fell silent, no humming, no speaking.\n“RUN FROM ME!” Kaladin demanded.\nHe did, dripping blood and shoving his way past the singer soldiers.\nHe’d retreated from previous battles, but this time they both knew it meant\nsomething different.\nThis creature was no longer the Pursuer.

He could feel their energy propelling\nhim. A counter to the darkness.\nHe turned toward the infirmary. The door had been opened. When had\nthat happened? He stepped toward it, but could see the Radiants in their\nlines on the floor, covered in sheets. Why weren’t they up and awake? Were\nthey feigning? That could work, pretending they were still asleep.\nSomething dropped from above. A body hit the ground in front of\nKaladin with a callous smack of skull on stone. It rolled, and Kaladin saw\nburned-out eyes. A terribly familiar bearded face. A face that had smiled at\nhim countless times, cursed at him an equal number, but had always been\nthere when everything else went dark.\nTeft.\nTeft was dead.\n* * *\nMoash landed a short distance from where Kaladin knelt over Teft’s body.\nSeveral of the watching soldiers stepped toward the Windrunner, but Moash\nraised his hand and stopped them.\n“No,” he said softly as Heavenly Ones hovered down around him.\n“Leave him be. This is how we win.”\nMoash knew exactly what Kaladin was feeling. That crushing sense of\ndespair, that knowledge that nothing would be the same. Nothing could ever\nbe the same. Light had left the world, and could never be rekindled.\nKaladin cradled Teft’s corpse, letting out a low, piteous whine. He began\nto tremble and shake—becoming as insensate as he had when King Elhokar\nhad died. As he had after Moash had killed Roshone. And if Kaladin\nresponded that way to the deaths of his enemies …\nWell, Teft dying would be worse. Far, far worse. Kaladin had been\nunraveling for years.\n“That,” Moash said to the Fused, “is how you break a storm. He’ll be\nuseless from here on out. Make sure nobody touches him.

He knelt and peered at a copy of the room with the crystal pillar.\nBeside it, produced in miniature, were a small crystal globe and\ngemstone. The fabrial glowed with a tiny light, barely visible. The final\nnode of the tower’s defenses, placed where anyone who looked would see\nit, but think nothing of it.\nRaboniel had known though. How long? He suspected she’d figured it\nout days ago, and was stalling to continue her research here. That one was\ntrouble. He summoned his Blade and used the tip to destroy the tiny fabrial.\nThen he walked over to the sectioned-off portion of the room. The child\nEdgedancer lay here, tied up and unconscious, next to Kaladin’s parents and\nbrother. Odium was interested in the Edgedancer, and Moash had been\nforbidden to kill her. Hopefully he hadn’t struck her head too hard. He\ndidn’t always control that as he should.\nFor now, he grabbed Lirin by his bound hands and dragged him—\nscreaming through his gag—out of the infirmary. There Moash waited until\nthe Pursuer came flying back as a shameful ribbon of light.\nThe Pursuer formed a body, and Moash pushed Lirin into the creature’s\nhands. “This is Stormblessed’s father,” Moash whispered. “No! Don’t say it\nloudly. Don’t draw Kaladin’s attention. His father is insurance; Kaladin has\nhuge issues with the man. If Kaladin somehow regains his senses,\nimmediately kill his father in front of him.”\n“This is nonsense,” the Pursuer growled. “I could kill Stormblessed\nnow.”\n“No,” Moash said, grabbing the Pursuer and pointing at his face. “You\nknow I have our master’s blessing. You know I speak to Command. You\nwill not touch Stormblessed. You can’t hurt him; you can’t kill him.”\n“He’s … just a man.…”\n“Don’t touch him,” Moash said. “If you interfere, it will awaken him to\nvengeance. We don’t want that yet. There are two paths open to him. One is\nto take the route I did, and give up his pain. The other is the route he should\nhave taken long ago. The path where he raises the only hand that can kill\nKaladin Stormblessed. His own.”\nThe Pursuer didn’t like it, judging by the rhythm he hummed. But he\naccepted Kaladin’s bound and gagged father and seemed willing to stay put.\nThe guards had quieted the rowdy humans, and the atrium was falling\nstill. Kaladin knelt before the storm, clinging to a dead man, shaking.\nMoash hesitated, searching inside himself. And … he felt nothing. Just\ncoldness.\nGood. He had reached his potential.\n“Don’t ruin this,” he told the gathered Fused. “I need to go kill a queen.”\n* * *\nNavani waited for her chance.\nShe had tried talking to the Sibling, but had heard only whimpers.

So she\nhad returned to the front of her room to wait for her chance to arrive.\nIt came when her door guard suddenly shouted, putting her hands to her\nhead in disbelief. She ran down the hallway. When Navani peeked out, she\nsaw what had caused the commotion: the field around the crystal pillar was\ngone. Someone had destroyed the final node. The Sibling was exposed.\nNavani almost ran over to attack with the anti-Voidlight dagger. She\nhesitated though, eyeing her traps in the hallway.\nA magnet. I need a magnet.\nShe’d seen one earlier, near the wreckage of her desk. She scrambled\nover and picked it up out of the rubble. Outside, she heard Raboniel’s order\necho with a clear voice.\n“Run,” she said to the guard. “Tell the Word of Deeds and the Night\nKnown to attend me. We have work to do.”\nThe guard dashed away. When Navani peeked out again, Raboniel was\nstepping into the chamber with the crystal pillar, alone.\nA chance. Navani slipped into the hallway and moved quietly toward\nRaboniel. After passing the crates with her carefully prepared traps, she\ntouched the magnet to a corner of the last crate and heard a click. She only\ndared take the time to arm one: a painrial that filled anyone who crossed\nthis point in the hallway with immense agony.\nThat done, she moved to the end of the corridor. The room with the\ncrystal pillar seemed darker than she remembered it. The Sibling had been\nalmost fully corrupted.\nRaboniel stood with her hand pressed against the pillar to finish the job.\nNavani forced herself forward, dagger held in a tight grip.\n“You should run, Navani,” Raboniel said to a calm rhythm, her voice\nechoing in the room. “There is a copy of our notebook on my desk in the\nhallway, along with your anti-Voidlight plate. Take them and make your\nescape.”\nNavani froze in place, holding the dagger’s hilt so tightly, she thought\nshe might never be able to uncurl her fingers.\nShe knows I’m here. She knows what she did in sending the guard away.\nLogic, Navani. What does it mean?\n“You’re letting me go on purpose?” she said.\n“Since the final node has been destroyed,” Raboniel said, “Vyre will\nsoon return to claim his promised compensation. However, if you have\nescaped on your own … well, then I have not defaulted on my covenant\nwith him.”\n“I can’t leave the Sibling to you.”\n“What do you think to do?” Raboniel asked. “Fight me?” She turned, so\ncalm and composed. Her eyes flickered to the dagger, then she hummed\nsoftly to a confused rhythm. She’d forgotten about it. She wasn’t as in\ncontrol as she pretended.\n“Is this how you wish to end our association?” Raboniel asked.\n“Struggling like brutes in the wilderness? Scholars such as we, reduced to\nthe exploitation of common blades? Run, Navani. You cannot defeat a\nFused in battle.”\nShe was right on that count. “I can’t abandon the Sibling,” Navani said."

You cannot defeat a\nFused in battle.”\nShe was right on that count. “I can’t abandon the Sibling,” Navani said.\n“My honor won’t allow it.”\n“We’re all children of Odium in the end,” Raboniel said. “Children of\nour Passions.”\n“You just said we were scholars,” Navani said. “Others might be\ncontrolled by their passions. We are something more. Something better.”\nShe took a deep breath, then turned the dagger in her hand, hilt out. “I’ll\ngive you this, then you and I can go back to my room to wait together. If\nVyre does defeat Stormblessed, I will submit to him. If not, you will agree\nto leave the Sibling.”\n“A foolish gamble,” Raboniel said.\n“No, a compromise. We can discuss as we wait, and if we come to a\nmore perfect accommodation, all the better.” She proffered the dagger.\n“Very well,” Raboniel said. She took the dagger with a quick snap of her\nhand, showing that she didn’t completely trust Navani. As well she\nshouldn’t.\nRaboniel strode down the hallway, Navani following several paces\nbehind.\n“Let’s get to this quickly, Navani,” Raboniel said. “I should think that\nthe two of us—”\nThen Raboniel stepped directly into Navani’s fabrial trap.\nFor ones so varied, they are somehow intense.\n—Musings of El, on the first of the Final Ten Days\nKaladin clung to Teft’s limp form and felt it all crumbling.

Like a hundred others. But he\ncouldn’t save them. He couldn’t protect them.\nSyl whimpered, shrinking in on herself. Kaladin wished he could shrink\nas well. Maybe if he’d lived as his father wanted, he could have avoided\nthis. He said he fought to protect, but he didn’t end up protecting anything,\ndid he? He just destroyed.

And nothingness.\n* * *\nNavani froze in place. Raboniel—suddenly struck with incredible pain from\nNavani’s trap—collapsed, dropping the dagger. Steeling herself, Navani\nwent down on her hands and knees, then lunged forward to grab it.\nThe pain was excruciating. But Navani had tested these devices upon\nherself, and she knew what they did. She lost control of her legs, but\nmanaged to crawl forward and plunge the dagger into Raboniel’s chest. She\nkept her weight on the weapon, pressing it down, smelling burned flesh.\nRaboniel screamed, writhing, clawing at Navani. The painrial did its job\nhowever, and prevented her from fighting back effectively.\n“I’m sorry,” Navani said through gritted teeth. “I’m … sorry. But next\ntime … try … not … to be … so trusting.”\nThe painrial soon ran out. Navani had set it up days ago, with a small\nVoidlight gemstone for power. It hadn’t been intended to work for very\nlong. She was pleased by the range though. She’d specifically worked on\nthat feature.\nNavani sat up, then wrapped her arms around herself, trying to fight off\nthe phantom effects of the pain. Finally she looked toward Raboniel’s\ncorpse.\nAnd found the Fused’s eyes quivering, not glassy and white like her\ndaughter’s had been. Navani scrambled away.\nRaboniel moved her arms limply, then turned her head toward Navani.\n“How?” Navani demanded. “Why are you alive?”\n“Not … enough … Light…” Raboniel croaked. She gripped the knife in\nher chest and pulled it free, letting out a sigh. “It hurts. I’m … I’m …\nnot…” She closed her eyes, though she continued to breathe.\nNavani inched forward, wary.\n“You must take … the notebook…” Raboniel said. “And you must …\nrun. Vyre … returns.”\n“You tell me to run, after I tried to kill you?”\n“Not … tried…” Raboniel said. “I … cannot hear rhythms.… My\nsoul … dying…” She pried open her eyes and fixed them on Navani.\n“You … tricked me well, Navani. Clever, clever. Well … done.”\n“How can you say that?” Navani said, glancing toward the desk and the\npapers on it.\n“Live … as long as I … and you can appreciate … anything … that still\nsurprises you.… Go, Navani. Run … The war must … end.”\nNavani felt sick, now that she’d gone through with it. An unexpected\npain pricked her at the betrayal. Nevertheless, she moved to the desk and\npicked up the notebook.\nI need to get this out of the tower, she realized. It is perhaps even more\nimportant than the Sibling. A way to kill Fused permanently. A way to …\nTo end the war. If both Radiant spren and Fused could die for good, it\ncould stop, couldn’t it?\n“Stormfather,” she whispered. “That’s what it was all about.” Raboniel"

If both Radiant spren and Fused could die for good, it\ncould stop, couldn’t it?\n“Stormfather,” she whispered. “That’s what it was all about.” Raboniel\nwanted to end the war, one way or another. The notebook Navani held was\na copy, and Navani realized that the original notebook would be in\nKholinar, delivered to the leaders of the singer military—likely along with\nthe vacuum chamber and the metal plates.\nNavani walked over to Raboniel. “You wanted a way to end it,” she said.\n“You don’t care who wins.”\n“I care,” Raboniel whispered. “I want … the singers to win. But your\nside … winning … is better than … than…”\n“Than the war continuing forever,” Navani said.\nRaboniel nodded, her eyes closed. “Go. Run. Vyre will—”\nNavani looked up as a blur flashed in the hallway, reflecting light. A\nthump hit her chest, and she grunted at the impact, stunned—briefly—\nbefore pain began to wash through her body. Sharp and alarming.\nA knife, she thought, befuddled to see the hilt of a throwing knife\nsticking from the side of her torso, next to her right breast. When she took a\nbreath, the pain sharpened with a sudden spike.\nShe looked up, pressing her hand to the wound, feeling warm blood spill\nout. At the far end of the hallway, a figure in a black uniform walked slowly\nforward. A Shardblade appeared in his hand. The assassin’s Blade.\nMoash had returned.\nHighmarshal Kaladin was dead.\n* * *\nVenli watched the human, so consumed by his grief that he knelt there,\nmotionless, for minutes on end. And they all watched. Silent Heavenly\nOnes. Solemn guards. Disbelieving humans. No one seemed to want to\nspeak, or even breathe.\nThat was how Venli should have felt upon losing her sister. Why didn’t\nshe have the emotions of a normal person? She’d been sad, but she didn’t\nthink she’d ever been so overcome by grief that she acted like\nStormblessed.\nTimbre pulsed comfortingly inside her. Everyone was different. And\nVenli was on the right path.\nExcept … there wasn’t really a point in returning to help now, was there?\nIt was over. Beside her, Leshwi descended until her feet touched the ground,\nthen she bowed her head.\nShow her, Timbre pulsed. What you are.\n“What? Now?”\nShow her.\nReveal what she was, in front of everyone? Venli shrank at the thought,\nattuning the Terrors.\nOne by one the other Heavenly Ones touched down, as if in respect. For\nan enemy.\n“This is stupidity,” the Pursuer said, shoving Lirin into Leshwi’s hands.\n“I can’t believe we’re all just standing here.”\nLeshwi looked up from her vigil, humming to Spite. Then, amazingly,\nshe pulled out a knife and cut Lirin’s hands free.\n“I have not forgotten how you tried to turn the Nine against me,” the\nPursuer said, pointing at Leshwi. “You seek to destroy my legacy.”"

I will prove myself and\ncontinue my tradition!”\n“No!” Leshwi said, passing the still-gagged human to one of the other\nHeavenly Ones. She grabbed the Pursuer, but he left a husk in her hand,\nexploding out as a ribbon of light to cross the atrium floor.\n“No…” Venli whispered.\nThe Pursuer appeared above Stormblessed. The Fused yanked a\nsharpened carapace spur off his arm, then—holding it like a dagger—he\ngrabbed the kneeling man by one shoulder.\nKaladin Stormblessed looked up and let loose a howl that seemed to\nvibrate with a hundred discordant rhythms. Venli attuned the Lost in return.\nThe Pursuer stabbed, but Stormblessed grabbed his arm and turned,\nbecoming a blur of motion. He somehow twisted around so he was behind\nthe Pursuer, then found a knife somewhere on his person—moving with\nsuch speed that Venli had trouble tracking him. Stormblessed slammed the\nknife at the Pursuer’s neck, who barely ejected from the husk in time.\nHe re-formed and tried to grab Stormblessed again. But there was no\ncontest now. Kaladin moved like the wind, fast and flowing as he rammed\nhis dagger through the Pursuer’s arm, causing him to shout in pain. A knife\ntoward the face followed, and the Pursuer ejected yet again. No one chanted\nor shouted this time, but when Stormblessed turned around, Venli saw his\nface—and she immediately attuned the Terrors.\nHis eyes were glowing like a Radiant’s, his face a mask of pain and\nanguish, but the eyes … she swore the light had a yellowish-red cast to it.\nLike … like …\nThe Pursuer appeared near the soldiers at the perimeter by the wall.\n“Go!” he shouted to his men. “Attack him! Kill him, and then kill the other\nRadiants! Your orders are chaos and death!”\nThe Pursuer charged forward.

Venli didn’t know if he realized, but he\nwas on his final body. Perhaps he knew he couldn’t run this time, not and\nsalvage any kind of reputation.\nStormblessed dashed to him, and they met near the vast window, flashing\nwith lightning. The Pursuer tried to grab him, and Kaladin welcomed it,\nfolding into the deadly embrace—then expertly slamming them both up\nagainst the window. Kaladin pressed the Pursuer to the glass—the storm\noutside flashed, shaking the tower, vibrating it and splashing it with light.\nIn that moment, Kaladin did something to the window.

But his body was stuck to\nthe wall.\nKaladin turned and strode toward the watching Heavenly Ones as the\nPursuer’s head ripped from his body and slammed to the floor with a\ncrunch.\n“Stormblessed,” Leshwi said, stepping out to meet him. “You have\nfought and won. Your loss is powerful, I know, as mortals are—”\nKaladin shoved her aside. He was coming for Venli, she was sure of it.\nShe braced herself, but he stalked past her, leaving her trembling to the\nTerrors. Instead Kaladin strode for the Heavenly One who was holding his\nfather. Of course.\nThat Heavenly One panicked as any would. She shot off into the air,\ncarrying the man.

He had only a vague memory of killing\nthe Pursuer. He knew he’d done it, but remembering was hard. Thinking\nwas hard.\nHe soared upward, chasing the creatures who had taken his father. He\nheard Lirin’s shouts echoing from above, so he’d gotten his gag off. Each\nsound condemned Kaladin.\nHe didn’t actually believe he could save his father.

Each breath\nwas agony, and she was losing so much blood. She stumbled and pressed up\nagainst the wall—smearing blood across a mural of a comet-shaped spren—\nto keep from falling.\nShe glanced over her shoulder. Moash continued walking, an inevitable\nmotion. Not rushed. His sword—with its elegant curve—held to the side so\nit left a small cut in the floor beside him.\n“Lighteyes,” Moash said. “Lying eyes. Rulers who fail to rule. Your son\nwas a coward at the end, Queen. He begged me for his life, crying.\nAppropriate that he should die as he lived.”\nShe saved her breath, not daring to respond despite her fury, and pressed\non down the hallway, trailing blood.\n“I killed a friend today,” Moash said, his terrible voice growing softer. “I\nthought surely that would hurt. Remarkably, it didn’t. I have become my\nbest self. Free. No more pain. I bring you silence, Navani. Payment for\nwhat you’ve done. How you’ve lived.

A distant storm. Everything was light\naround him up here, the sun shining, making it difficult to believe that\nsomewhere it was dark and tempestuous. Somewhere, someone was lost in\nthat blackness.\nThe Stormfather appeared beside him, moving in the air alongside\nDalinar—a rare occurrence. The Stormfather never had features. Merely a\nvague impression of a figure the same size as Dalinar, yet extending into\ninfinity.\nSomething was wrong.\n“What?” Dalinar said.\nThe Son of Tanavast has entered the storm for the last time, the\nStormfather said. I feel him.\n“Kaladin?” Dalinar said, eager. “He’s escaped?”\nNo. This is something far worse.\n“Show me.”\n* * *\nKaladin fell.\nThe wind tossed him and whipped at him. He was just rags. Just … rags\nfor a person.\nI’ve forgotten the Words, Kaladin, Syl said, weeping. I see only darkness.\nHe felt something in his hand, her fingers somehow gripping his as they fell\nin the storm.\nHe couldn’t save Teft.\nHe couldn’t save his father.\nHe couldn’t save himself.\nHe’d pushed too hard, used a grindstone on his soul until it had become\npaper thin. He’d failed anyway.\nThose were the only Words that mattered. The only true Words.\n“I’m not strong enough,” he whispered to the angry winds, and closed\nhis eyes, letting go of her hand.\n* * *\nDalinar was the storm around Kaladin. And at the same time he wasn’t. The\nStormfather didn’t give Dalinar as much control as he had before, likely\nfearing that Dalinar would want to push him again. He was right.\nDalinar watched Kaladin tumble. Lost. No Stormlight. Eyes closed. It\nwasn’t the bearing of a man who was fighting. Nor was it the bearing of\nsomeone who rode the winds.\nIt was the bearing of someone who had given up.\nWhat do we do? Dalinar asked the Stormfather.\nWe witness.

I have already sent another of the Heavenly Ones to ask Raboniel.”\nVenli winced at the screams. “But Raboniel said these Radiants were to\nbe preserved!”\n“No longer,” Leshwi said. “Something happened in the night. Raboniel\nhad needed the Radiants for tests she intended to perform, but she had one\nof them brought to her, and afterward she said she needed no further tests.\nThe rest are now a liability, possibly a danger, should they wake.” She\nlooked toward the dying humans, then shied away as some warforms ran\npast with bloody axes.\n“It is … unfortunate,” Leshwi said. “I do not sing to Joy in this type of\nconflict.

Storms, he couldn’t be older\nthan seventeen or eighteen. That seemed so young to Kaladin now, though\nhe wasn’t that much older. The squadleader was arguing with a shorter\nsoldier beside him.\n“We can’t hold,” the squadleader said. “It’s impossible. Storms, they’re\ngathering for another advance.”\n“The orders are clear,” the other man said—barely out of his teens\nhimself. “Brightlord Sheler says we’re to hold here. No retreat.”\n“To Damnation with that man,” the squadleader said, wiping his sweaty\nhair, surrounded by jets of exhaustionspren. Kaladin immediately felt a\nkinship with the poor fool. Given impossible orders and not enough\nresources? Looking along the ragged battle line, Kaladin guessed the man\nwas in over his head, with all the higher-ranked soldiers dead. There were\nbarely enough men to form three squads, and half of those were wounded.\n“This is Amaram’s fault,” Kaladin said. “Playing with the lives of half-\ntrained men in outdated equipment, all to make himself look good so he’ll\nget moved to the Shattered Plains.”\nThe young squadleader glanced at Kaladin, frowning. “You shouldn’t\ntalk like that, kid,” the man said, running his hand through his hair again.\n“It could get you strung up, if the highmarshal hears.” The man took a deep\nbreath. “Form up the wounded men on that flank. Tell everyone to get ready\nto hold. And … you, messenger boy, grab your friend and get some spears.\nGor, put them in front.”\n“In front?” the other man asked. “You certain, Varth?”\n“You work with what you have…” the man said, hiking back the way he\nhad come.\nWork with what you have.\nEverything spun around Kaladin, and he suddenly remembered this exact"

He knew where he was. He knew that squadleader’s face. How\nhad he not seen it immediately?\nKaladin had been here. Rushing through the lines, searching for …\nSearching for …\nHe spun on his heel and found a young man—too young—approaching\nVarth. He had an open, inviting face and too much spring in his step as he\napproached the squadleader. “I’ll go with them, sir,” Tien said.\n“Fine. Go.”\nTien picked up a spear. He gathered the other messenger boy from the\ntent and started toward the place where he’d been told to stand.\n“No, Tien,” Kaladin said. “I can’t watch this. Not again.”\nTien came and took Kaladin’s hand, then walked him forward. “It’s all\nright,” he said. “I know you’re frightened. But here we can stand together,\nall of us. Three are stronger than one, right?” He held out his spear, and the\nother boy—who was crying—did the same.\n“Tien,” Kaladin said. “Why did you do it? You should have stayed safe.”\nTien turned to him, then smiled. “They would have been alone. They\nneeded someone to help them feel brave.”\n“They were slaughtered,” Kaladin said. “So were you.”\n“So it was good someone was there, to help them not feel so alone as it\nhappened.”\n“You were terrified. I saw your eyes.”\n“Of course I was.” Tien looked at him as the charge began, and the\nenemy advanced up the hillside. “Who wouldn’t be afraid? Doesn’t change\nthat I needed to be here. For them.”\nKaladin remembered getting stabbed on this battlefield … killing a man.\nThen being forced to watch Tien die. He cringed, anticipating that death,\nbut all went dark. The forest, the tent, the figures all vanished.\nExcept for Tien.\nKaladin fell to his knees. Then Tien, poor little Tien, wrapped his arms\naround Kaladin and held him. “It’s all right,” he whispered. “I’m here. To\nhelp you feel brave.”\n“I’m not the child you see,” Kaladin whispered.\n“I know who you are, Kal.”\nKaladin looked up at his brother. Who somehow, in that moment, was\nfull grown. And Kaladin was a child, clinging to him. Holding to him as the\ntears started to fall, as he let himself weep at Teft’s death.\n“This is wrong,” Kaladin said. “I’m supposed to hold you. Protect you.”\n“And you did. As I helped you.” He pulled Kaladin tight. “Why do we\nfight, Kal? Why do we keep going?”\n“I don’t know,” Kaladin whispered. “I’ve forgotten.”\n“It’s so we can be with each other.”\n“They all die, Tien. Everyone dies.”\n“So they do, don’t they?”\n“That means it doesn’t matter,” Kaladin said. “None of it matters.”\n“See, that’s the wrong way of looking at it.” Tien held him tighter."

The times we helped each\nother.”\nKaladin trembled.\n“Look at it, Kal,” Tien said softly. “See the colors. If you think letting\nTeft die is a failure—but all the times you supported him are meaningless—\nthen no wonder it always hurts. Instead, if you think of how lucky you both\nwere to be able to help each other when you were together, well, it looks a\nlot nicer, doesn’t it?”\n“I’m not strong enough,” Kaladin whispered.\n“You’re strong enough for me.”\n“I’m not good enough.”\n“You’re good enough for me.”\n“I wasn’t there.”\nTien smiled. “You are here for me, Kal. You’re here for all of us.”\n“And…” Kaladin said, tears on his cheeks, “if I fail again?”\n“You can’t. So long as you understand.” He pulled Kaladin tight.\nKaladin rested his head against Tien’s chest, blotting his tears with the cloth\nof his shirt. “Teft believes in you. The enemy thinks he’s won. But I want to\nsee his face when he realizes the truth. Don’t you? It’s going to be\ndelightful.”\nKaladin found himself smiling.\n“If he kills us,” Tien said, “he’s simply dropped us off at a place we were\ngoing anyway. We shouldn’t hasten it, and it is sad. But see, he can’t take\nour moments, our Connection, Kaladin. And those are things that really\nmatter.”\nKaladin closed his eyes, letting himself enjoy this moment. “Is it real?”\nhe finally asked. “Are you real? Or is this something made by the\nStormfather, or Wit, or someone else?”\nTien smiled, then pressed something into Kaladin’s hand. A small\nwooden horse. “Try to keep track of him this time, Kal. I worked hard on\nthat.”\nThen Kaladin dropped suddenly, the wooden horse evaporating in his\nhand as he fell.\nHe searched around in the endless blackness. “Syl?” he called.\nA pinprick of light, weaving around him. But that wasn’t her.\n“SYL!”\nAnother pinprick. And another.\nBut those weren’t her. That was. He reached into the darkness and seized\nher hand, pulling her to him. She grabbed him, physical in this place and his\nown size.\nShe held to him, and shook as she spoke. “I’ve forgotten the Words. I’m\nsupposed to help you, but I can’t. I…”\n“You are helping,” Kaladin said, “by being here.” He closed his eyes,\nfeeling the storm as they broke through the moment between and entered\nthe real world.\n“Besides,” he whispered, “I know the Words.”\nSay them, Tien whispered.\n“I have always known these Words.”\nSay it, lad! Do it!\n“I accept it, Stormfather! I accept that there will be those I cannot\nprotect!”"

On her\nknees. Venli knelt as well, as Leshwi still held to her face—but the grip\nsoftened.\nA cool, beautiful light flooded in through the window behind. Like a\nfrozen lightning bolt, brighter than any sphere. Bright as the sun.\n“What have you done, Venli?” Leshwi said. “What have you done?”\n“I … I swore the First Ideal of the Radiants,” Venli said. “I’m sorry.”\n“Sorry…” Leshwi said. A joyspren burst around her, beautiful, like a\nblue storm. “Sorry? Venli, they’ve come back to us! They’ve forgiven us.”\nWhat?\n“Please,” Leshwi said to Longing, “ask your spren. Do they know of an\nhonorspren named Riah? She was my friend once. Precious to me.”\nLeshwi … had friends? Among the spren?\nStorms. Leshwi had lived before the war, when men and singers had\nbeen allies. Honor had been the god of the Dawnsingers.\nTimbre pulsed.\n“She … doesn’t know Riah,” Venli said. “But she doesn’t know a lot of\nhonorspren. She … doesn’t think any of the old ones survived the human\nbetrayal.”\nLeshwi nodded, humming softly to … to one of the old rhythms.\n“My spren though,” Venli said. “She … has friends, who are willing to\nmaybe try again. With us.”\n“My soul is too long owned by someone else for that,” Leshwi said.\nVenli glanced toward the fighting. The sudden light hadn’t halted them.\nIf anything, it had made the Pursuer’s soldiers more determined as they\nattacked. They seemed to enjoy the company of the angerspren and\npainspren. Some of the humans had wrestled away weapons, but most of\nthem fought unarmed, trying desperately to keep the Radiants safe.\n“I don’t know what to do,” Venli whispered. “I keep wavering between\ntwo worlds. I’m too weak, mistress.”\nLeshwi rose into the air, then ripped her side sword from its sheath. “It’s\nall right, Voice.

The voice that responded was soft as a baby’s breath on her\nskin. Almost imperceptible. I hear this rhythm. I hear it in the darkness.\nWhy?\n“Where is it coming from?”\nThere.\nNavani was given an impression, a vision that overlaid her senses. A\nplace in the tower … the atrium, dark from a storm blowing outside? Down\nhere, deep within the basement, she hadn’t realized one was going on.\nFighting. People were fighting, struggling, dying. Navani squinted at the\nvision. Her pain was fading—though a part of her felt that was a bad sign.\nBut she could see … a Fused, flying a foot off the ground, fighting beside\nsomeone infused with Voidlight. A Regal? And those were humans with\nthem, standing together. Side by side.\n“What are they doing?” Navani asked.\nFighting other singers. I think. It’s so dark. Why do they fight each\nother?\n“What’s in that room they defend?” Navani whispered.\nThat is where they put the fallen Radiants.\n“Emulsifier,” Navani whispered.\nWhat?\n“A joined purpose. Humans and singers. Honor and Odium. They’re\nfighting to protect the helpless, Sibling.”\nThe vision faded, but before it did, Navani spotted Rlain—the singer\nwho worked with Bridge Four.\n“He’s there,” Navani said, then found herself coughing. Each convulsion\nmade the pain flare up again. “Sibling, he’s there!”\nToo far, they whispered. Too late …\nOutside in the hallway, Moash hacked at Raboniel’s left arm—making it\nfall limp. She clawed at him with her remaining arm, hissing, as the hand\nwith the dagger dropped its weapon and dangled uselessly.\n“Take me,” Navani whispered to the Sibling. “Bond me.”\nNo, the Sibling said, voice faint.\n“Why?”\nYou aren’t worthy, Navani.\n* * *\nRlain heard the shouting long before they reached the atrium.

That noise had to be from Kaladin’s fight with\nthe Pursuer.\nRlain was, therefore, utterly shocked when they walked into the atrium\nto find a full-on civil war. Singers fought against singers, and a group of\nhumans stood side by side with one of the forces.\nRlain’s guards went running—perhaps to find some kind of authority\nfigure to sort out this nonsense—leaving him and Dabbid. But the fray\nended quickly, and the side with the humans won. Few of the singers\nseemed to want to fight Fused, and so the troops fled, leaving the dead\nbehind them.\n“What?” Dabbid asked softly, the two of them hanging back in one of\nthe side corridors where some human civilians—brave enough to watch, but\nnot skilled enough to join—clustered.\nRlain made a quick assessment, then attuned the Rhythm of Hope.

Five\nof the Heavenly Ones—and about twenty Regals under their command—\nhad turned upon the soldiers of the Pursuer. The other Heavenly Ones\nseemed to have refused to join either side, and had retreated up higher into\nthe atrium.\nThat was Leshwi, hovering near the front of the side that had won—\nholding a sword coated in orange singer blood. She seemed to be in charge.\nA good number of people, both human and singer, were down and\nbleeding. It was a mess. “They need field surgeons,” Rlain said. “Come on.”\nHe and Dabbid raced in and—as Kaladin had trained them—started a\nquick triage. People began helping, and in minutes Rlain had them all\nbinding wounds for both singers and humans, regardless of which side\nthey’d fought on.\nLirin had supplies in the infirmary, fortunately—and when Dabbid\nreturned with them, he brought Hesina, who seemed rattled by the fighting.\nIt was a few minutes before Rlain got an explanation. Lirin had been taken?\nKaladin had given chase?\nRlain attuned the Lost. No wonder Hesina looked like she’d been\nthrough a storm. Still, she seemed eager to have something to do, and took\nover leading the triage.\nThat let Rlain step away for a breather and wipe his hands. Some\nhumans who had seen it all gave him scattered explanations. The Pursuer\nhad ordered the slaughter of helpless Radiants, and both humans and\nsingers had resisted his army. Before Rlain could go demand answers from\nVenli, several gruff human men approached him. He recognized them from\nthe sessions Kaladin had been doing, helping them with trauma. They’d\nbeen forced to pick up weapons again, the poor cremlings.\n“Yes?” Rlain asked.\nThey led him to a body placed reverently beside the wall, the eyes\nburned out. Teft.\nRlain fell to his knees as Dabbid joined him, letting out a quiet whimper,\nanguishspren surrounding them. They knelt together, heads bowed. Rlain\nsang the Song of the Fallen, a song for a dead hero. It seemed the plan\nhadn’t gone off too well for them either.\n“Lift?” he asked.\n“She’s in the infirmary,” Dabbid whispered. “Unconscious. Legs dead\nfrom a Blade. Looks like someone hit her hard on the head. She … is\nbleeding. I tried to give her Stormlight. Nothing happened.”\nRlain attuned Mourning. Lift could heal others, but—like with Kaladin\nand Teft—her internal healing wasn’t working. So much for waking the\nRadiants. He bowed his head for Teft, then left him there. Let the dead rest.\nIt was their way, and he wished to be able to give the man a proper sky\nburial. Teft had been a good person. One of the best.\nBehind him, other matters drew Rlain’s attention.

We\ncan contain this if you submit.”\n“You’re not in rebellion?” one of the men demanded. “What was that\nthen?”\n“We ain’t obeying one of you again,” another bellowed. “Ever!”\nShouts from both sides rose as singers ordered the people not to argue\nwith one of the Fused. Rlain turned from one group to the other, then\nattuned Determination and wiped the makeup from his tattoo. He strode out\nbetween the groups. Field medicine wasn’t the only thing Bridge Four had\ntaught.\n“Listen up!” he shouted to Confidence. “All of you!”\nRemarkably, they fell silent. Rlain did his best Teft impersonation as he\nturned to the humans. “You all, you know me. I’m Bridge Four. I know you\ndon’t like me, but are you willing to trust me?”\nThe humans grumbled, but most of them nodded, prompted by Noril.\nRlain turned toward the singers. “You all,” he barked to Confidence,\n“absolutely committed treason. You acted against Odium’s wishes, and he\nwill seek retribution for that. You’re as good as dead—and you Fused,\nyou’re in for an eternity of torture. Fortunately, you have two people here\nwho can guide you—listeners from a people who escaped his control. So if\nyou want to survive, you’re going to listen to me.”\nLeshwi folded her arms. But then muttered, “Fine.” The other Heavenly\nOnes seemed willing to follow her lead.\nVenli rushed over, and she was infused with the deep violet light of\nVoidlight. Far more so than an ordinary Regal. She glowed more, in fact,\nthan a Fused.\n“What are you?” Rlain demanded.\n“A Radiant,” she said to Consolation. “Kind of. I can use Voidlight to\npower my abilities, so they work in the tower.”\n“Figures,” Rlain grumbled. “Kelek’s breath … I wait years, then you of\nall people grab a spren first.” Maybe that was too much Teft. “Anyway, it\nexplains how you got Lift out. We need to get moving. Odium won’t stand\nfor a rebellion among his own. So you singers are going to come with us.\nWe’re going to grab the Radiants and we’re going to carry them out onto\nthe plateau, where we’ll escape via the Oathgates to the Shattered Plains.”\n“That puts us in the humans’ power,” Leshwi said.\n“I’ll get you out of it,” Rlain said. “After we’re all safe.

He was a spy, used to staying back, letting others lead while he\nwatched. Today, though, there hadn’t been anyone else. And having been\nrejected by both sides, he figured he was an outsider—and therefore as\nclose to a neutral party as there could be in this conflict.\nEveryone worked together to move the unconscious Radiants and the\nwounded.

I wondered\nwhy they let you have one instead of giving it to a Fused, but now I can\npiece it together. Yours is a living Radiant Blade—which can work the\nOathgates. I guess your Voidlight lets you summon it?”\nVenli hummed to Anxiety. “I don’t have a Blade, Rlain.”\n“But—”\n“I was lying! I used my powers to get her out.

It was him.\nKaladin proved it by rotating so that they were right-side up—then\nhoisting Lirin into a tight embrace. Remarkably, as Lirin touched the Plate,\nhe couldn’t feel it. It became completely transparent—barely visible, in\nfact, as a faint outline around Kaladin.\n“I’m sorry, Father,” Kaladin said.\n“Sorry? For … for what?”\n“I thought your way might be correct,” Kaladin said. “And that I’d been\nwrong. But I don’t think it’s that simple. I think we’re both correct. For us.”\n“I think perhaps I can accept that,” Lirin said.\nKaladin leaned back—still holding him as they dangled barely twenty\nfeet above the rocks. Storms. Was that how close they’d come? “Cutting it a\nlittle tight, don’t you think, son?”\n“A surgeon must be timely and precise.”\n“This is timely?” Lirin said.\n“Well, you do hate it when people waste time,” Kaladin said, grinning.\nThen he paused, letting go of Lirin with one arm—which was somewhat\ndisconcerting, though Lirin now seemed to be floating on his own. Kaladin\ntouched Lirin’s forehead with fingers that felt normal, despite being faintly\noutlined by the gauntlet.\n“What is this?” Kaladin asked.\nLirin remembered, with some embarrassment, what he’d finally let that\none-armed fool Noril do to him. A painted shash glyph on Lirin’s forehead.\n“I figured,” Lirin said, “that if an entire tower was going to show faith in\nmy son, I could maybe try to do the same. I’m sorry, son. For my part.” He\nreached up and brushed aside Kaladin’s hair to see the brand there.\nBut as he did, he found scabs flaking away, the brands falling off to the\nstones below like a shell outgrown, discarded. Clean, smooth skin was left\nbehind.\nKaladin reached to his forehead in shock. He prodded at the skin, as if\namazed. Then he laughed, grabbing Lirin in a tighter embrace.\n“Careful, son,” Lirin said. “I’m not a Radiant. We mortals break.”\n“Radiants break too,” Kaladin whispered. “But then, fortunately, we fill\nthe cracks with something stronger. Come on. We need to protect the people\nin that tower. You in your way. Me in mine.”\nAnd so I am not at all dissatisfied with recent events.\n—Musings of El, on the first of the Final Ten Days\nDalinar returned from the Stormfather’s vision and found himself still flying\nwith the Windrunners—face mask in place, wrapped in several layers of\nprotective clothing.\nHe felt clunky and slow after being the winds moments ago. But he\nreveled in what he’d heard and felt. What he’d said.\nThese Words are accepted.\nWhatever was happening at Urithiru, Kaladin would face it standing up\nstraight.

        "text": "straight. God Beyond bless it to be enough, and that the Windrunner could\nreach Navani. For now, Dalinar had to focus on his current task.\nHe urged his speed to increase, but of course that did nothing. He had no\ncontrol over this lesser flight; in it, Dalinar was little more than an arrow\npropelled through the air by someone else’s power—buffeted by the jealous\nwinds, which did not want him invading their sky.\nA part of him acknowledged the puerile nature of these complaints. He\nwas flying. Covering a hundred miles in less than half an hour. His current\ntravel was a wonder, an incredible achievement. But for a brief time he’d\nknown something better.\nAt least this particular flight was nearly finished. It was a relatively quick\njump from the battlefields of Emul down to the border of Tukar, where\nIshar’s camp had been spotted. The main bulk of the god-priest’s armies\nhad repositioned during the coalition’s campaign, fortifying positions in\ncase the singers or Dalinar’s army tried to advance into Tukar.\nSo as Dalinar’s team reached the coast, they found several depopulated\ncamps, marked by large bonfire scars on the stone. The region had been\ndenuded—trees chopped for lumber, hills stripped of anything edible. An\narmy could forage and hunt to stay alive here in the West, where plants\ngrew more readily. In the Unclaimed Hills, that had never been possible.\nSigzil slowed their group of five Windrunners, Dalinar, and Szeth into a\nhovering position. Beneath them, Ishar’s large pavilion remained, and some\nhundred soldiers stood in a ring in front. These wore similar clothing:\nhogshide battle leathers with hardened cuirasses painted a dark blue, closer\nto black than the Kholin shade. Not a true uniform, but in a theme at least.\nConsidering their lack of Soulcasters and the prevalence of herdsmen in the\narea, the equipment made sense. They were armed mostly with spears,\nthough some had steel swords.\n“They’re ready for us all right,” the Azish Windrunner said, steadying\nDalinar in the air so he didn’t drift away. “Brightlord, I don’t like this.”\n“We’re all Radiant,” Dalinar said, “with plenty of gemstones and a\nBondsmith to renew our spheres. We’re as prepared as anyone could be for\nwhatever will happen below.”\nThe companylord glanced toward Szeth, who had been ostensibly flown\nby Sigzil, but had actually used his own Stormlight. Dalinar had let Sigzil in\non the secret, naturally—he wouldn’t leave an officer ignorant of his team’s\ncapabilities.\n“Let me at least send someone else down first,” Sigzil said. “To talk, find\nout what they want.”\nDalinar took a deep breath, then nodded. He was impatient, but one did\nnot build good officers by ignoring their legitimate suggestions. “That\nwould be wise.”\nSigzil conferred with his Windrunners, then swooped toward the ground.\nApparently “someone else” had meant him. Sigzil landed and was met by\nIshar himself, who emerged from the pavilion. Dalinar could identify the\nHerald immediately. There was a bond between them. A Connection."

        "text": "Ishar himself, who emerged from the pavilion. Dalinar could identify the\nHerald immediately. There was a bond between them. A Connection.\nSigzil was not attacked by the soldiers in the large ring. Talking to\nShalash these last few days, Dalinar thought he had a good picture of the\nold Herald. He had always imagined Ishi as a wise, careful man, thoughtful.\nReally, Dalinar’s image of him had always been similar to that of Nohadon,\nthe author of The Way of Kings.\nShalash had disabused him of these notions. She presented Ishar as a\nconfident, eager man. Energetic, more a battlefield commander than a wise\nold scholar. He was the man who had discovered how to travel between\nworlds, leading humans to Roshar in the first place.\nOne word that Shalash had never used was “crafty.” Ishar was a bold\nthinker, a man who pulled others after him on seemingly crazed ideas that\nworked. But he was not a subtle man. Or at least he hadn’t been. Shalash\nwarned that all of them had changed over the millennia, their … personal\nquirks growing more and more pronounced.\nDalinar was not surprised that Sigzil was able to speak to the man, then\nfly back up safely. Ishar did not seem the type to plan an ambush.\n“Sir,” Sigzil said, floating up beside Dalinar. “I … don’t think he’s\naltogether sane, despite what Shalash says.”\n“That was expected,” Dalinar said. “What did he say?”\n“He claims to be the Almighty,” Sigzil said. “God, born again, after\nbeing shattered. He says he’s waiting for Odium’s champion to come and\nfight him for the end of the world. I think he means you, sir.”\nChilling words. “But he’s willing to talk?”\n“Yes, sir,” Sigzil said. “Though I must warn you I don’t like this entire\nsituation.”\n“Understood. Take us down.”\nSigzil gave the orders, and they made their way to the ground and landed\nin the center of the ring of soldiers. A few Windrunners summoned\nShardblades; the others, not yet of the Third Ideal, carried spears. They\nsurrounded Dalinar in a circular formation, but he patted Sigzil on the\nshoulder and made them part.\nHe walked toward Ishar, Szeth shadowing him on one side, Sigzil on the\nother. Dalinar had not expected the old Herald to look so strong. Dalinar\nwas used to the frailty of men like Taravangian, but the person before him\nwas a warrior. Though he was outfitted in robes and wearing an ardent’s\nbeard, his forearms and stance clearly indicated he was accustomed to\nholding a weapon.\n“Champion of Odium,” Ishar said in a loud, deep voice, speaking Azish.\n“It has been a long wait.”\n“I am not Odium’s champion,” Dalinar said. “I wish to be your ally in\nfacing him, however.”\n“Your lies cannot fool me. I am Tezim, first man, aspect of the Almighty.\nI alone prepare for the end of the worlds. I should not have ignored your"

I should not have ignored your\nprevious messages to me; I see now what you are. What you must be. Only\na servant of my enemy could have captured Urithiru, my holy seat.”\n“Ishar,” Dalinar said softly. “I know what you are.”\n“I am that man no longer,” Ishar said. “I am Herald of Heralds, sole\nbearer of the Oathpact. I am more than I once was and I will become yet\nmore. I shall absorb your power, Odium, and become a god among gods,\nAdonalsium reborn.”\nDalinar took a tentative step forward, waving for the others to stay back.\n“I spoke to Ash,” Dalinar said calmly. “She said to tell you that Taln has\nreturned. He’s hurt, and she pleads for your help in restoring him.”\n“Taln…” Ishar said. He adopted a far-off look. “Our sin. Bearer of our\nagonies…”\n“Jezrien is dead, Ishar,” Dalinar said. “Truly dead. You felt it. Ash felt it.\nHe was captured, but his soul faded away after that. Her father, Ishar. She\nlost her father. She needs your counsel. Taln’s madness terrifies her. She\nneeds you.”\n“I prepared myself for your lies, champion of Odium,” Ishar said. “I had\nnot realized they would be so … reasonable. Yet you have already done too\nmuch to prove who you are. Taking my holy city. Summoning your evil\nstorm. Sending your minions to torment my people. You have corrupted the\nspren to your side, so you can have false Radiants, but I have discovered\nyour secrets.” He held his hands as if to summon a Blade. “The time for the\nend is upon us. Let us begin the battle.”\nA weapon appeared from mist in his hands. A sinuous Shardblade lined\nwith glyphs Dalinar did not recognize—though the Blade itself was vaguely\nfamiliar. Had he seen it before?\nSzeth hissed loudly. “That Blade,” he said. “The Bondsmith Honorblade.\nMy father’s sword. Where did you get it? What have you done to my\nfather?”\nIshar stepped forward to strike at Dalinar.\n* * *\nWhile some humans left Rlain’s band of rebels—returning to their rooms,\nhoping they hadn’t been recognized—most of them stayed. Indeed, the\nnumbers increased as many of the resisters fetched their families. Because\nRlain had to let them go fetch families. What else could they do? Leave\nthem to the Pursuer, who was known to target the loved ones of people he\nhunted?\nAll of this ate away at their time. They were also slowed by the need to\ncarry both the wounded and the unconscious Radiants. Rlain did what he\ncould to keep the main group moving, taking them through the Breakaway,\navoiding the central corridor—where they’d be too easily exposed to\nHeavenly Ones from above.\nHowever, he found himself attuning Despair.

Rlain’s band wasn’t quite halfway through the market—still a fair\ndistance from the front of the tower—when cracks broke the air, causing\ngawking marketgoers to flee. Stormform lightning strikes, used as a signal\nto empty the streets.\nRlain backed his haggard group against the wall of the large cavern and\nput their soldiers up front, the Heavenly Ones flying above. Deepest Ones\nbegan to emerge from the floor in front of them, and dozens of stormforms\napproached.\n“You’re right, listener,” Leshwi said, lowering down beside him. “I\ncouldn’t have talked us out of this. He knows what we did. Those who\napproach are humming the Rhythm of Executions.”\n“Maybe we should have tried to reach the crystal pillar room,” Rlain\nsaid. “And escaped through the tunnels beneath, as Venli suggested.”\n“No,” Leshwi said. “Those tunnels are blocked. Our best hope was to\nescape out the front entrance of the tower, and perhaps cross the mountains.\nUnfortunately, judging by those rhythms, these who come aren’t being sent\nby Raboniel. Odium wants me to know. I will be tortured like the Heralds\nonce I return to Braize.” She saluted Rlain. “So first, we fight.”\nRlain nodded, then gripped his spear. “We fight,” he said, then turned to\nVenli, who had stepped up by his side. “Are there any other spren like the\none who bonded you? Would some want other willing singers? Someone\nlike me?”\n“Yes,” Venli said to Mourning, “but I sent them away. The Fused would\nhave seen them, hunted them.” She paused, then her rhythm changed to\nConfusion. “And Timbre says … she says you’re spoken for?”\n“What?” he said. “By that honorspren who said he’d take me? I turned\nhim down. I…”\nThe room went dark.\nThen it shone as crystals grew out from his feet like … like stained glass\nwindows, covering the floor. They showed a figure rising in blue-glowing\nShardplate, and a tower coming alight.\nKeep fighting, a voice said in his head. Salvation will be, Rlain, listener.\nBridger of Minds. I have been sent to you by my mother, at the request of\nRenarin, Son of Thorns. I have watched you and seen your worthiness.\nSpeak the Words, and do not despair.\n* * *\nSigzil blocked Ishar’s attack using his Shardblade. The other Windrunners\nswarmed forward to protect Dalinar. Szeth, however, stumbled away. The\nsight of that Honorblade had plainly upset him.\nThe watching Tukari soldiers started to close their circle, but Ishar\nordered them back. Then he danced away from Sigzil, shouting at Dalinar.\n“Fight me, champion! Face me alone!”\n“I brought no weapon, Ishar,” Dalinar said. “The time for the contest of\nchampions has not yet come.”\nIshar fought brilliantly as the other Windrunners tried to gang up on him."

        "text": "“I brought no weapon, Ishar,” Dalinar said. “The time for the contest of\nchampions has not yet come.”\nIshar fought brilliantly as the other Windrunners tried to gang up on him.\nHe was a blur with a flashing Blade, parrying, dodging, skepping his Blade\n—making it vanish for a brief moment to pass through a weapon trying to\nblock it. The Windrunners had only recently started practicing the\ntechnique; Ishar performed the complex move with the grace of long\nfamiliarity.\nHe is a duelist, Dalinar thought. Storms, and a good one.\nWhat did you expect? the Stormfather rumbled in his mind. He defended\nmankind for millennia. The Heralds were not all warriors when they began,\nbut all were by the end. Existing for three thousand years in a state of near-\nconstant war changes men. Among the Heralds, Ishar was average in skill.\nIshar faced all five Windrunners at once, and it seemed easy for him. He\nblocked one, then another, stepping away as a third tried to spear down\nfrom above, then swept around with his Blade, slicing the heads off two\nnon-Shard spears.\nSigzil’s Shardblade became a long dueling sword designed for lunges.\nHe struck when Ishar’s back was turned, but the Herald casually twisted\nand caught the Blade with one finger—touching it along the unsharpened\nside—and guided it past him. Sigzil stumbled as he drew too close, and\nIshar lifted that same hand and slammed it against Sigzil’s chest, sending\nhim sprawling backward to the stones.\nIshar then turned and raised his Shardblade in one hand to deflect one of\nLyn’s strikes. Leyten came in, trying to flank, but he looked clumsy\ncompared to the old Herald. Fortunately for the five, Ishar merely defended\nhimself.\nDespite earnestly trying, none could land a blow. It was as if … as if\nthey were trying to hit where Ishar was, while he was able to move in\nanticipation of where they would be.\nHe is average among them? Dalinar asked. Then … who was the best?\nTaln.\nThe one who sits in my camp? Dalinar thought. Unable to do more than\nmumble?\nYes, the Stormfather said. There was no dispute. But take care; Ishar’s\nskill as a duelist is a lesser danger. He has recovered his Honorblade. He is\na Bondsmith unchained.\nIshar suddenly dashed forward, rushing into one of Sigzil’s attacks. The\nold man ducked the strike, then came up and touched Sigzil on the chest.\nWhen Ishar’s hand withdrew, he trailed a line of Stormlight behind him. He\ntouched his hand to the ground, and Sigzil stumbled, gasping as his glow\nstarted to fade. Ishar had apparently tethered Sigzil to the stones with some\nkind of glowing rope that drained the Stormlight out and into the ground.\nThe other four followed, almost faster than Dalinar could track. One\nafter another, tethered to the stone. Not bound, not frozen, but their Light\ndraining away—and all of them stumbled, slowing, as if their lives were\nbeing drained with it."

Not bound, not frozen, but their Light\ndraining away—and all of them stumbled, slowing, as if their lives were\nbeing drained with it.\nDalinar glanced at Szeth, but the Shin man had fallen to his knees, wide\neyed. Storms. Dalinar should have known better than to depend on the\nassassin as a bodyguard. Navani had warned him; Szeth was nearly as\nunstable as the Heralds.\nDalinar didn’t want to see what happened when his troops ran out of\nStormlight. He braced himself and thrust his hands between realms, then\nslammed them together as closed fists, knuckles meeting. In this, he united\nthe three realms, opening a flash of power that washed away all color and\ninfused the Radiants with Light.\nWithin the well of Light, Dalinar was nearly blinded—figures were mere\nlines, all shadows banished. Ishar, however, was distinct. Pale, eyes wide,\nwhitened clothing rippling. He dropped his Blade and it turned to mist.\nTransfixed, he stepped toward Dalinar.\n“How?” Ishar asked. The word sounded clear, an incongruity against the\nsoundless rush of power surrounding them. “You … you open Honor’s\npath.…”\n“I have bonded the Stormfather,” Dalinar said. “I need you, Ishar. I don’t\nneed the legend, the Herald of Mysteries. I need the man Ash says you once\nwere. A man willing to risk his life, his work, and his very soul to save\nmankind.”\nIshar strode closer. Holding the portal open was difficult, but Dalinar\nkept his hands pressed together. For the moment only he and Ishar existed\nhere, in this place painted white. Ishar stopped a step or two from Dalinar.\nYes, seeing another Bondsmith had shaken him.\nI can reach him, Dalinar thought.\n“I need a teacher,” Dalinar said. “I don’t know my true capabilities.\nOdium controls Urithiru, but I think with your help we could restore the\nRadiants there. Please.”\n“I see,” Ishar said softly. He met Dalinar’s eyes. “So. The enemy has\ncorrupted the Stormfather too. I had hoped…”\nHe shook his head, then reached out and pressed his hand to Dalinar’s\nchest. With the strain of keeping the perpendicularity open, Dalinar wasn’t\nable to move away in time. He tried to drop the perpendicularity, but when\nhe pulled his hands apart, it remained open—power roaring through.\nIshar touched his hand to his own chest, creating a line of light between\nhim and Dalinar. “I will take this bond to the Stormfather. I will bear it\nmyself. I sense … something odd in you. A Connection to Odium. He sees\nyou as … as the one who will fight against him. This cannot be right. I will\ntake that Connection as well.”\nDalinar gasped, falling to his knees as something was torn from him—it\nfelt as if his very soul was being ripped out. The Stormfather screamed: a\nterrifying, agonized sound, like lightning that warped and broke.\nNo, Dalinar thought. No. Please …\nA shadow appeared on the field of whiteness.

This single line of darkness swiped through the line\nconnecting Dalinar to Ishar.\nThe white cord exploded and frayed, trailing wisps of darkness. Ishar\nwas cast away, hitting the stone. The perpendicularity remained open, but\nits light dimmed to reveal Szeth standing between Dalinar and Ishar,\nbrandishing his strange black Shardblade. His illusion melted off like paint\nin the rain, breaking into Light—which was sucked into the sword and\nconsumed.\n“Where,” Szeth said to Ishar, his voice quiet, “did you get that Blade you\nbear?”\nThe Herald seemed not to have heard him. He was staring at Szeth’s\nsword as it dripped black liquid smoke. Around it, the white light of the\nperpendicularity warped and was consumed, like water down a drain.\nSzeth spun and stabbed the sword into the heart of the perpendicularity.\nThe Stormfather shouted in anger as the perpendicularity collapsed, folding\nin upon itself.\nIn a flash, the world was full of color again. All five Windrunners lay on\nthe ground, but they were stirring. Ishar scrambled to his feet before Szeth\n—who stood with one arm wreathed in black tendrils, gripping the sword\nthat dripped nightmares and bled destruction.\n“Answer me!” Szeth screamed. “Did you kill the man who held that\nBlade before you?”\n“Of course not, foolish man,” Ishar said, summoning his Blade. “The\nShin serve the Heralds. They held my sword for me. They returned it when I\nrevealed myself.”\nDalinar wiped his brow, pulling himself to his feet. He felt numb, but at\nthe same time … warm. Relieved. Whatever the Herald had begun, he had\nnot been able to finish.\nAre you all right? he asked the Stormfather.\nYes. He tried to steal our bond. It should not be possible, but Honor no\nlonger lives to enforce his laws.…\nThe perpendicularity. Did Szeth … destroy it?\nDon’t be foolish, the Stormfather said. No creation of mortal hands could\ndestroy the power of a Shard of Adonalsium. He merely collapsed it. You\ncould summon it again.\nDalinar was not convinced that the thing Szeth bore was a simple\n“creation of mortal hands.” But he said nothing as he forced himself to\ncheck on the Windrunners, whose Connections to the ground had vanished.\nLeyten had found his feet first and was helping Sigzil, who sat on the\nground with a hand to his head.\n“I think your worries about this meeting were well advised,” Dalinar\nsaid, kneeling beside the Azish man. “Can you get us into the air?”\n“Damnation,” Sigzil whispered. “I feel like I spent last night drinking\nHorneater white.” He burst alight with Stormlight, drawing it from the\npouch at his belt. “Storms. The Light isn’t washing away the pain.”\n“Yeah,” Lyn said.

We kept your\nsecrets, but you lie if you say my father gave you that Blade!”\n“Your father was barely a man when I found him,” Ishar said. “The Shin\nhad accepted the Unmade. Tried to make gods of them. I saved them. And\nyour father did give me this Blade. He thanked me for letting him die.”\nSzeth screamed, charging Ishar—who raised his Blade to casually block\nhim, as he had with the Windrunners. However, the meeting of the two\nBlades caused a burst of power, and the shock wave sent both men\nsprawling backward.\nIshar hit hard, dropping his Blade—and Dalinar was in position to see\nthe length of the Honorblade as it hit and bounced, then came to a rest half\nstuck into the ground. There was a chip in its unearthly steel where it had\nmet the black sword.\nDalinar, in all his life, had never seen a Shardblade marred in such a\nway, let alone one of the Honorblades.\nIshar looked up at Szeth, dazed, then grabbed his Blade and shouted an\norder. His soldiers—who had watched all this in silence—broke their circle,\nmoving into a formation. Sigzil put his hand on Dalinar’s shoulder, infusing\nhim, preparing to Lash him.\n“Wait,” Dalinar said as Ishar stood and slammed his fists together. A\nperpendicularity opened, as it had before, releasing a powerful explosion of\nlight.\nImpossible … the Stormfather said in Dalinar’s mind. I didn’t feel it\nhappen. How does he do this?\nYou’re the one who warned me he was dangerous, Dalinar thought. Who\nknows what he’s capable of?\nAcross the stone field, Szeth sheathed his sword just before it began\nfeasting on his soul. Dalinar pointed Leyten that way. “Grab him. Get into\nthe air. We’re leaving. Sigzil, Lash me.”\n“Right, sir.”\n“Dalinar. Dalinar Kholin.”\nThat … that was Ishar’s voice.\n“I can see clearly,” the voice said from within the perpendicularity. “I do\nnot know why. Has a Bondsmith been sworn? We have a Connection, all of\nus.… Nevertheless, I feel my sanity slipping. My mind is broken, and I do\nnot know if it can be healed.\n“Perhaps you can restore me for a short time after an Ideal is spoken near\nme.

Transported into Shadesmar.\n* * *\nTogether, Navani and the Sibling could create Light.\nLight that drove the monster Moash back along the corridor, holding his\narm before his eyes. Light that drove the knife from Navani’s side as it\nhealed her wound. Light that brought fabrials to life, Light that sang with\nthe tones of Honor and Cultivation in tandem.\nBut her spren … The Sibling was so weak.\nNavani grasped the pillar, pouring her power into it, but there was so\nmuch chaos muddying the system, like crem in a cistern of pure water. The\nVoidlight Raboniel had injected.\nNavani couldn’t destroy it, but maybe she could vent it somehow. She\nsaw the tower now as an entity, with lines of garnet very like veins and\narteries. And she inhabited that entity. It became her body. She saw\nthousands of closed doors the scouts had missed in mapping the tower. She\nsaw brilliant mechanisms for controlling pressure, heat—\nNo, stay focused.\nI think we need to vent the Voidlight, Navani said to the Sibling.\nI … the Sibling said. How?\nI can sing the proper tone, Navani said. We fill the system with as much\nTowerlight as will fit, then we stop and vibrate these systems here, here, and\nhere with the anti-Voidlight tone.\nI suppose, the Sibling said. But how can we create the vibration?\nThere’s a plate on Raboniel’s desk. I’ll have my scholars play that. I’ll\nneed a model to sing it, but with that, I should be able to transfer the\nvibration through the system. That should force the enemy’s corruption out\nthrough these broken gemstones in the pump mechanism. What do you\nthink?\n… Yes? the Sibling said softly. I think … yes, that might work.\nWith that done, we will need to restart the tower’s protections, Navani\nsaid. These are complex fabrials … made of the essence of spren. Of your\nessence?\nYes, the Sibling said, their voice growing stronger. But they are\ncomplicated, and took many years of—\nPressure fabrial here, Navani said, inspecting it with her mind. Ah, I see.\nA network of attractors to bring in air and create a bubble of pressure.\nQuite ingenious.\nYes!\nAnd the heating fabrials … not important now … but you’ve made\nhousings for them out of metals—you manifested physically as metal and\ncrystal, like Shardblades manifest from smaller spren.\nYES!"

What was that moving\nthrough the tower? Highmarshal Kaladin? Flying quickly, his powers\nrestored, wrapped in spren as armor. He had achieved his Fourth Ideal.\nAnd he was going the wrong direction.\nShe could easily see his mistake. He’d decided the best way to protect\nthe tower was to come here, to the pillar, and rescue Navani. But no, he was\nneeded elsewhere.\nShe drew his attention with flashing lights on the wall.\nSibling? Kaladin’s voice soon sounded through the system as he touched\nthe crystal vein.\nYes and no, Highmarshal, Navani said. The pillar is secure. Get to the\nBreakaway market. Tell the enemies you find there that they’d best retreat\nquickly.\nHe obeyed immediately, changing the direction of his flight.\nNavani, full of incredible awareness, got to work.\n* * *\nDalinar persuaded the Windrunners to linger in the sky above Ishar’s camp,\nrather than flying immediately back to the Emuli warcamp.\nHe worried about them though. The Radiants drooped like soldiers who\nhad completed a full-day, double-time march. Ordinarily Stormlight would\nhave perked them up, but they complained of headaches their powers\ncouldn’t heal.\nThe effects shouldn’t be permanent, the Stormfather said. But I cannot\nsay for certain. Ishar Connected them to the ground. Essentially, their\npowers saw the stones as part of their body—and so tried to fill the ground\nwith Stormlight as it fills their veins.\nI can barely make sense of what you said, Dalinar replied, hanging in the\nsky far above Ishar’s camp. How are such things possible?\nThe powers of a Bondsmith are the powers of creation, the Stormfather\nsaid. The powers of gods, including the ability to link souls. Always before,\nHonor was here to guard this power, to limit it. It seems that Ishar knows\nhow to make full use of his new freedom.\nThe Stormfather paused, then rumbled more softly. I never liked him.\nThough I was only a wind then—and not completely conscious—I remember\nhim. Ishar was ambitious even before madness took him. He cannot bear\nsole blame for the destruction of Ashyn, humankind’s first home, but he was\nthe one Odium first tricked into experimenting with the Surges.\nYou don’t particularly like anyone, Dalinar noted.\nNot true. There was a human who made me laugh once, long ago. I was\nsomewhat fond of him.\nIt felt like a rare attempt at levity. Dared Dalinar hope it was progress in\nthe ancient spren?\nBelow, Ishar’s large pavilion waited, flapping in the gentle wind. Dalinar\nhad seen no sign of servants or soldiers peeking out.\n“Sir?” Sigzil said, floating over to Dalinar. “My troops need to rest.”\n“A few minutes longer,” Dalinar said, narrowing his eyes.\n“What are we waiting for, sir?”\n“To see if Ishar returns. He fled to Shadesmar. He could return at any"

If he does, we’re leaving at speed. But if he doesn’t…” Ishar\nhadn’t been expecting to run. Szeth, and that strange Blade, had driven him\naway. “This could be a rare opportunity, Companylord. He was a scholar\namong Heralds; he might have written notes that give hints to applications\nof Bondsmith powers.”\n“Understood, sir,” Sigzil said.\nDalinar glanced toward Szeth, who floated on his own away from the\nothers, Lashed into the sky by his own power. Dalinar nodded toward him,\nand Sigzil—catching the meaning—gave Dalinar a brief Lashing that sent\nhim over beside the assassin.\nSzeth was muttering to himself. “How did he know? How did the old\nfool know?”\n“Know what?” Dalinar said as he drifted near Szeth. “Ishar? How did he\nknow about your people?”\nSzeth blinked, then focused on Dalinar. It was odd to see him looking\nlike himself with that too-pale skin and those wide eyes. Dalinar had grown\naccustomed to his Alethi illusions.\n“I must begin preparing myself,” Szeth said. “My next Ideal is my quest,\nmy pilgrimage. I must return to my people, Blackthorn. I must face them.”\n“As you wish,” Dalinar said. He wasn’t certain he wanted to unleash this\nman upon anyone, least of all the one neutral kingdom of note in this\nconflict. But Jasnah had indicated it would happen, and besides, he doubted\nhe could stop Szeth from doing anything he truly wanted to. “Your people.\nThey have all of the Honorblades?”\n“All but three,” Szeth said. “The Blade of the Windrunners was mine for\nyears. The Blade of the Skybreakers was reclaimed by Nin long ago. And of\ncourse the Blade of the Stonewards was never ours to protect. So there were\nseven, but if Ishar has his Blade…”\nYou don’t need those other swords, a perky voice said in Dalinar’s mind.\nI am as good as ten swords. Did you see how great I was?\n“I saw,” Dalinar said to the sword. “You … chipped a Shardblade. An\nHonorblade.”\nI did? Wow. I am a great sword. We destroyed a lot of evil, right?\n“You promised not to speak into the minds of others, sword-nimi,” Szeth\nsaid softly. “Do you not remember?”\nI remember. I just forgot.\n“I will send a team with you to Shinovar,” Dalinar said. “As soon as we\nreturn to our camp.”\n“No,” Szeth said. “No. I must go alone, but not yet. I must prepare. I\nhave … something important to do. He knew. He should not have\nknown.…”\nStorms. Dalinar wasn’t certain who was more insane: Szeth or the\nsword. The combination was particularly unnerving.\nWithout them, you would be dead, the Stormfather said, and I’d be\nbonded against my will. This Shin man is dangerous, but I fear Ishar more."

Let’s see if he left anything of value in that tent.”\n* * *\nAdin raised the spear he’d found in the atrium. People were crying,\nsurrounded by fearspren, as the group of beleaguered humans and singers\ntogether made a circle around their wounded. They pushed the elderly and\nthe children to the center, but Adin didn’t go with those. The spren watching\nwould see that he wasn’t the type to hide. Even women had picked up\nweapons, including the surgeon’s wife, who had given her son to one of the\nyoung girls at the center to hold. War was a masculine art, but when you\nstarted attacking women, you’d stopped engaging in war. You deserved\nanything that happened to you after that point.\nAdin’s father was among the wounded. Alive, bless the Heralds, but\nbleeding badly. He’d fought for the Radiants, when Adin … Adin had\nhidden in the hallway.\nStorm him, he wasn’t going to be a coward again. He … he wasn’t. Adin\nfell into line beside a fearsome parshman in incredible carapace armor, then\ntried to position himself with his spear out, in that parshman’s same posture.\nThe stormforms marched in, singing a terrible song. Adin found himself\ntrembling, his hands slick on his spear.\nOh, storms.\nIn that moment, he didn’t want to earn a spren. He didn’t want to fight.\nHe wanted to be home making plates, listening to his father hum. He didn’t\nwant to be standing here, knowing that they were all … all going to …\nA hand took Adin by the shoulder and moved him backward. Not all the\nway back, but enough for the figure to stand in front of him. It was the quiet\nbridgeman, Dabbid. Adin didn’t complain, not after seeing those\nstormforms. Felt good to have someone in front of him, though the\nbridgeman’s spear shook. He was acting afraid to fool the enemy, right?\nThe stormforms didn’t release lightning, which was good. The others\nhad thought they might not, because of the marketplace. Their powers were\ntoo wild. Regardless, there seemed to be … be hundreds of them. A call\ncame from somewhere behind, and they came charging in—rippling with\nred lightning that flashed when they touched something.\nIn seconds, everything was chaos. Adin screamed, squeezing his eyes\nshut, holding out his spear and shaking.\nNo, he had to fight. He had to—\nSomething knocked into him from behind, throwing him forward. The\nstrike dazed him, and he lost his spear. When he rolled over, a Voidbringer\nwith red eyes stood above him. The creature casually speared downward.\nAdin didn’t even have time to scream before—\nClink.\nClink?\nThe stormform cocked his head, humming an odd song.

Adin looked at his body as\nhe lay prone on the floor.\nHis torso was surrounded by glittering blue armor. He raised his hands,\nand found them covered in gauntlets.\nHe was in Shardplate.\nHe was in SHARDPLATE.\n“Ha!” he shouted, and kicked at the stormform. The creature went flying,\nsoaring twenty feet and slamming into a wall. Adin had barely felt any\nresistance. It was like he’d always imagined. It …\nThe Shardplate vanished off him and turned into a group of windspren,\nwhich soared over to Dabbid, who was about to take an axe to the head.\nClink.\nBoth combatants—the human now shrouded in Shardplate, and the\nenemy who had hit him—froze in place, stunned. The enemy backed away,\nand the Plate flew off again, this time surrounding the lead Heavenly One.\nShe’d been spearing at a stormform who released a flash of lightning that\nenveloped her.\nWhen Adin’s eyes cleared, he saw her floating in Shardplate, staring at\nher hands in obvious wonder. Confused, the stormforms began calling out,\ndisengaging and re-forming into ranks.\nThe armor burst apart, forming those strange windspren who flew into\nthe air overhead before latching on to a figure hovering above the buildings.\nThe Plate had fit everyone, but him it matched. A brilliant Knight\nRadiant in glowing armor, holding aloft an intricate Shardspear. He left the\nhelmet off so they could all see. Kaladin Stormblessed, bright as the sun.\n“I bring word from the Sibling!” he shouted. “They don’t remember\ninviting you in. And considering that they aren’t merely the master of this\nhouse, they literally are this house, your actions are quite the insult.”\nBrilliant lights suddenly began running up the walls, making the very\ncore of the stones glow as if molten in the center. Similar lights burst to life\nin the ceiling.\nThe ground trembled, as if the entire mountain were shaking. Clanking\nsounds rang in the hallways, like distant machines, and wind began to blow\nin the vast chamber—which now was as bright as day. Most amazing, the\nlightning on the stormforms went out.\nDeepest Ones, who had been clawing out of the ground and grabbing at\nthe feet of soldiers, began screaming and going limp, trapped in the stone.\nThe Heavenly Ones who had been helping dropped to the ground suddenly,\nthen collapsed, unconscious.\nGroans sounded from behind. The Radiants on the floor at the center of\nthe circle began stirring. They were awake!\n“You may turn in your weapons,” Stormblessed said to the enemy. “And\nreturn to your kind unharmed, so long as you promise me one thing.” He\nsmiled. “Tell him that I’m particularly going to enjoy hearing what he\nlooked like when he found out what happened here today.”\n* * *\nA strange, unpleasant stench struck Dalinar as he stepped into Ishar’s\npavilion.\nThe odor was chemically harsh, and he felt a faint burning in his eyes."

        "text": "* * *\nA strange, unpleasant stench struck Dalinar as he stepped into Ishar’s\npavilion.\nThe odor was chemically harsh, and he felt a faint burning in his eyes.\nHe blinked in the dim light, finding a large chamber filled with slab tables\nand sheets shrouding something atop them. Bodies? The Windrunners had\ngone in first, of course, but they were busy inspecting the recesses of the\ntent to check for an ambush.\nDalinar walked up to one of the slabs and yanked off the shroud. He\nsimply found a body underneath, an incision in its abdomen made with\nclean surgical precision. Male, with the clothing cut off and lying beside the\nbody. Very pale skin and stark white hair—in death, the hair and skin\nseemed almost the same color. That skin had a blue cast to it; probably a\nNatan person.\nSo Ishar was a butcher, a mad surgeon as well as a crazed theocrat. For\nsome reason, that relieved Dalinar. It was disgusting, but this was an\nordinary kind of evil. He’d expected something worse.\n“Sir?” Mela the Windrunner called from across the room. “You should\nsee this.”\nDalinar walked over to Mela, who stood beside one of the other slabs.\nSzeth remained in the doorway to the pavilion, seated on the ground,\nholding his sheathed sword across his lap. He seemed not to care about the\ninvestigation.\nAnother corpse—half revealed by a drawn-back sheet—was on the slab\nin front of Mela, though this one was far stranger. The elongated body had a\nblack shell covering most of it, from neck to feet. That had been cut free to\nopen up the chest. Dalinar couldn’t make sense of the shell. It looked like\nclothing, kind of, but was hard like singer carapace—and had apparently\nbeen attached to the skin.\nThe head was a soggy mass of black flesh, soft like intestines, with no\nvisible eyes or features.\n“What on Roshar…” Dalinar said. “The hands seem human, if too long,\nbut the rest of it…”\n“I have no idea,” Mela said. She glanced away and shivered. “It’s not\nhuman, sir. I don’t know what it is.”\nIn the back of Dalinar’s mind, the Stormfather rumbled.\nThis … the spren said. This is not possible.\nWhat? Dalinar asked.\nThat is a Cryptic, he said. The Lightweaver spren. Only they don’t have\nbodies in this realm. They can’t.\n“Sir,” Lyn said from a nearby slab. The corpse she’d uncovered was a\npile of vines vaguely shaped like a person.\nCultivationspren … the Stormfather said. Return to that first body you\nsaw. NOW.\nDalinar did not object and walked toward the front of the pavilion. What\nhe’d first dismissed as an ordinary body now seemed anything but. The\nwhite-blue hair, the pieces of clothing that were—he now recognized—the\nexact same color as the body. The Stormfather’s thunder grew distant.\nI knew him, the Stormfather said. I could not see it at first. I did not want\nto see it. This is Vespan. Honorspren.\n“So they’re not … some kind of attempt at making men into mimicries"

Spren do not die like\nmen. They are power that cannot be destroyed. They … This is IMPOSSIBLE.\nDalinar searched through the chamber, where more and more drawn-\nback sheets revealed different strange corpses. Several just skeletons, others\npiles of rock.\nThis place is evil, the Stormfather said. Beyond evil. What has been done\nhere is an abomination.\nSigzil jogged over, holding some ledgers he’d found in the rear. Dalinar\ncouldn’t make sense of them, but Sigzil pointed at the Azish glyphs, reading\nthem.\n“This is a list of experiments, I think,” the companylord said. “The first\ncolumn is the name of a spren, the second column a date. The third is a\ntime … maybe how long they lived? None seem to have survived longer\nthan a few minutes.”\n“Blood of my fathers,” Dalinar said, his hands trembling. “And this last\ncolumn?”\n“Notes, sir,” Sigzil said. “Here, the last entry. ‘Our first honorspren lived\nnearly fifteen minutes. A new record, and orders of magnitude longer than\nall previous attempts. Honorspren seem to have the most humanlike\nessences. When transferred, the organs and muscles form most naturally.\nWe must capture more of them.\n“‘Cryptics and ashspren are impossible to bring over properly with our\ncurrent knowledge. The process of creating bodies for them results in a\nphysical form that collapses upon itself immediately. It appears their\nphysiology works against the fundamental laws of the Physical Realm.’”\n“Storms,” Leyten said, running a hand through his short hair. “What does\nit mean?”\nLeave this place immediately, the Stormfather said. We must warn my\nchildren.\n“Agreed,” Dalinar said. “Grab anything you think might be useful and\nmeet me outside. We’re leaving.”\n* * *\nMoash fled through the tower, using Lashing after Lashing, as he felt the\nstructure rumble. Felt it come alive. Felt light begin to surround him.\nHer light. The queen’s light.\nAnd before that, a terrible sound. It had pushed away his Connection to\nOdium, forcing Moash to feel pain for the things he’d done—pain he didn’t\nwant. Pain he’d given away.\nThat pain seethed and spread inside him. He’d killed Teft.\nHe’d. Killed. TEFT.\nGet out, get out, get out! he thought as he tore through a hallway,\nuncaring whether he hit people with his Shardblade as he passed over their\nheads. He needed it ready. In case Kaladin found him. In case he hadn’t\nbroken.\nThe walls were glowing, and the light seemed brighter to Moash than it\nshould have. He wasn’t supposed to feel afraid! He’d given that away! He\ncouldn’t be the man he needed to be if he was afraid, or … Or.\nThe pain, the shame, the anger at himself was worse than the fear.\nGet out. Go. Go!"

Dalinar listened to it in a daze.\nGood news. Finally, good news.\nHe wanted to immediately get flown to Azimir so he could go see\nNavani, but he recognized the foolishness in that. He needed at least a short\nrest before enduring another lengthy flight, and there was that imminent\nhighstorm to worry about. He ordered a message sent to his wife, promising\nto come to her before the day was out. Then he asked Jasnah and the Prime\nif he could meet with them after the storm.\nAfter that, they left him to at last approach the small building he made\nhis base. It felt like coming home. Of course, he’d lived enough of his life\nout on campaign that “home” had acquired a loose definition. Any place\nwith a soft bed usually counted.\nUrithiru really is safe now, Dalinar, the Stormfather said in his mind. I\nwas so distracted by the dead spren that I didn’t notice at first. The Sibling\nhas fully awakened. Another Bondsmith? The implications of this …\nDalinar was still trying to deal with those himself. Navani bonding a\nspren? That was wonderful, but he was so emotionally worn at the moment,\nhe just wanted to sit and think. He pushed open the door to his house,\nstumbled through, and entered a vast golden field.\nThe ground shimmered as if infused with Stormlight. Dalinar pulled to a\nhalt and turned around. The doorway was gone, the doorknob having\nvanished from his hand. The sky was a deep reddish orange, like a sunset.\nHe was in a vision. But he hadn’t heard the highstorm hit.\nAnd … no. This wasn’t a highstorm vision. This was something else. He\nturned with trepidation, looking across the glimmering field to where a\nfigure—clad in golden robes—stood on a nearby hilltop, facing away from\nDalinar and staring out at the horizon.\nOdium. Storms within, Dalinar thought, flagging. Not now. I can’t face\nhim right now.\nWell, a soldier couldn’t always pick his battlefield. This was the first\ntime Odium had appeared to him in a year. Dalinar needed to use this.\nHe took a deep breath and pushed through his fatigue. He hiked up the\nhillside and eventually stopped beside the figure in gold. Odium held a\nsmall scepter like a cane, his hand resting on the ball at the top.\nHe appeared different from when Dalinar had last seen him. He still\nresembled a wise old man with a grey beard cut to medium length. A\npaternal air. Sagacious, knowing, understanding. Only now his skin was\nglowing in places, as if it had grown thin and a light inside was seeking to\nescape. The god’s eyes had gone completely golden, as if they were chunks\nof metal set into a statue’s face.\nWhen Odium spoke, there was a harsh edge to his tone, his words\nclipped. Barely holding in his anger.\n“Our Connection grows, Dalinar,” Odium said. “Stronger by the day. I\ncan reach you now as if you were one of my own. You should be.”"

Odium had lost the\ntower—Urithiru was safe and there was another Bondsmith. He’d failed\nagain.

All this time, he’d been asking what a god could possibly\nfear, but the answer was obvious. Odium feared men who would not obey\nhim.\nHe feared Dalinar.\n“Ishar told me some curious things this latest visit,” Dalinar said. “He\ngave me a book with secrets in it. He is not as mad as I feared, Odium. He\nshowed me my Connection to you, and explained how limited you are.\nThen he proved to me that a Bondsmith unchained is capable of incredible\nfeats.” He looked at the ancient being. “You are a god. You hold vast\npowers, yet they bind you as much as they free you. Tell me, what do you\nthink of a human bearing the weight of a god’s powers, but without that\ngod’s restrictions?”\n“The power will bind you eventually, as it has me,” Odium said. “You\ndon’t understand a fraction of the things you pretend to, Dalinar.”\nYet you’re afraid of me, Dalinar thought. Of the idea that I might fully\ncome into my power. That you’re losing control of your plans.\nPerhaps Dalinar’s errand to Tukar hadn’t been a failure. He hadn’t\ngained Ishar’s wisdom, but so long as Odium thought he had …\nBless you, Renarin, Dalinar thought. For making my life unpredictable to\nthis being. For letting me bluff.\n“We made an agreement,” Odium said. “A contest of champions. We\nnever set terms.”\n“I have terms,” Dalinar said. “On my desk.

        "text": "never set terms.”\n“I have terms,” Dalinar said. “On my desk. A single sheet of paper.”\nOdium waved his hand and the words began appearing—written as if in\nglowing golden ink—in the sky before them. Enormous, intimidating.\n“You didn’t write this,” Odium said, his eyes narrowing. “Nor did that\nElsecaller.” The light grew more vibrant beneath Odium’s skin, and Dalinar\ncould feel its heat—like that of a sun—rising. Making his skin burn.\nAnger. Deep anger, white hot. It was consuming Odium. His control was\nslipping.\n“Cephandrius,” Odium spat. “Ever the rat. No matter where I go, there\nhe is, scratching in the wall. Burrowing into my strongholds. He could have\nbeen a god, yet he insists on living in the dirt.”\n“Do you accept these terms?” Dalinar asked.\n“By this, if my champion wins,” Odium said, “then Roshar is mine?\nCompletely and utterly. And if yours wins, I withdraw for a millennium?”\n“Yes. But what if you break your word? You’ve delayed longer than you\nshould have. What if you refuse to send a champion?”\n“I cannot break my word,” Odium said, the heat increasing. “I basically\nam incapable of it.”\n“Basically?” Dalinar pressed. “What happens, Odium, if you break your\nword.”\n“Then the contract is void, and I am in your power. Same, but reversed,\nif you break the contract. You would be in my power, and the restrictions\nHonor placed upon me—chaining me to the Rosharan system and\npreventing me from using my powers on most individuals—would be void.\nBut that is not going to happen, and I am not going to break my word.\nBecause if I did, it would create a hole in my soul—which would let\nCultivation kill me.\n“I am no fool, and you are a man of honor. We will both approach this\ncontest in good faith, Dalinar. This isn’t some deal with a Voidbringer from\nyour myths, where one tricks the other with some silly twist of language. A\nwilling champion from each of us and a fight to the death. They will meet\non the top of Urithiru. No tricks, no lies.”\n“Very well,” Dalinar said. “But as the terms state, if your champion is\ndefeated, it isn’t only you who must withdraw for a thousand years. The\nFused must go with you, locked away again, as well as the spren that make\nRegals. No more forms of power. No more Voidspren.”\nThe light pulsed inside Odium and he turned his eyes back toward the\nhorizon. “I … cannot agree to this.”\n“The terms are simple,” Dalinar said. “If you—”\n“I said I cannot agree,” Odium said. “The Everstorm has changed\neverything, and Cephandrius should have realized this. Singers can adopt\nRegal forms powered by the Everstorm. The Fused are free now; they can\nbe reborn without my intervention. The Oathpact could have imprisoned\nthem, but it is now defunct. I am literally unable to do as you ask, not\nwithout destroying myself in the process.”"

I am literally unable to do as you ask, not\nwithout destroying myself in the process.”\n“Then we cannot have an accommodation,” Dalinar said. “Because I’m\ncertainly not going to agree to anything less.”\n“And if I agreed to less?”\nDalinar frowned, uncertain, his mind muddled from fatigue. The creature\nwas going to try to trick him. He was certain of it. So, he did what he\nthought best. He said nothing.\nOdium chuckled softly, rotating his scepter beneath his hand so the butt\nground against the golden stone at their feet. “Do you know why I make\nmen fight, Dalinar? Why I created the Thrill? Why I encourage the wars?”\n“To destroy us.”\n“Why would I want to destroy you? I am your god, Dalinar.” Odium\nshook his head, staring into the infinite golden distance. “I need soldiers.\nFor the true battle that is coming, not for one people or one miserable\nwindswept continent. A battle of the gods. A battle for everything.\n“Roshar is a training ground. The time will come that I unleash you upon\nthe others who are not nearly as well trained. Not nearly as hardened as I\nhave made you.”\n“Curious,” Dalinar said. “I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but your\n‘hardening’ tactic has resulted in Fused who are going mad from the stress.”\nThe light grew stronger inside Odium, seeming as if it might explode\nfrom his skin.\n“If your champion wins, I will step away for a thousand years,” he said.\n“I will retreat to Braize, and I will no longer speak to, contact, or influence\nthe Fused or Voidspren. But I cannot contain them. And you will have to\npray that your descendants are as lucky as you are, as I will be less …\nlenient when I return.”\nDalinar started to speak, but Odium interrupted.\n“Let me finish,” he said. “In exchange for you giving up one thing you\nwanted, I will give up one in turn. If I win, I will give up my grand plans for\nRoshar. I will leave this planet for a thousand years, and abandon all I’ve\nworked for here. I give you and the singers freedom to make your own\npeace. Freedom for you, and freedom for me.\n“This is all I ask for my victory: As you represent Honor, you can relax\nhis prohibitions on me. No matter what happens in the contest, you never\nhave to worry about me again. All I want is away from this miserable\nsystem.”\nOf course it wouldn’t be as easy as Wit had promised. Dalinar wavered.\nWit looked out for himself, as he’d always said he would. The contract\nreinforced that idea. Odium offered a different, tempting prospect. To be rid\nof him, to fight this war as an ordinary war …\nTwo forces pulled at him. Which did he trust? He doubted that any\nmortal—Jasnah included—could construct a contract good enough to hold a\ngod. But to simply give Wit what he desired?\nWho do you trust more? Wit, or the god of anger?\nIt wasn’t really in question. He didn’t trust Wit much, but he didn’t trust"

He didn’t trust Wit much, but he didn’t trust\nOdium at all. Besides, if Honor had died to trap this god here on Roshar,\nDalinar had to believe the Almighty had done so for good reason.\nSo he turned to go. “Send me back, Odium,” Dalinar said. “There will be\nno agreement today.”\nA flare of heat washed over him from behind. Dalinar spun, finding\nOdium glowing with a bright red-gold light, his eyes wide, his teeth\nclenched.\nStand firm, Dalinar thought to himself. Wit says he can’t hurt you. Not\nwithout breaking his word … not without inviting his own death …\nWit hadn’t included that last part. But Dalinar stood his ground,\nsweating, his heart racing. Until at last the power abated, the heat and light\nretreating.\n“I would prefer,” Odium said, “to make an agreement.”\nWhy so eager? Dalinar thought. It’s the power, isn’t it? It’s ripping you\napart for delaying. It wants out.\n“I’ve offered you an agreement,” Dalinar said.\n“I’ve told you that I cannot keep to these terms. I can seal myself away,\nbut not my minions. I can demand that the Fused and the Unmade retreat—\nbut not all currently obey my will. And I can do nothing about the Regals.”\nDalinar took a deep breath. “Fine,” he said, “but I cannot entertain an\nagreement that frees you from this world. So we should focus on our\nconflict, you and me. If I win, you are exiled to Damnation and withdraw\nfrom the conflict entirely. If you win, I will go into exile, and my people\nwill have to fight without my aid.”\n“You offer a mortal life for that of a god?” Odium demanded. “No,\nDalinar. If I win, I want the Knights Radiant. The forces of Alethkar and\nUrithiru will surrender to my Fused, and your Radiants will end this war.\nThe other foolish kingdoms of men can keep fighting if they wish, but your\npeople and mine will begin preparing for the true war: the one that will\nbegin when the gods of other worlds discover the strength of Surgebinding.\nYour heirs will be bound to this, as you are.”\n“I cannot negotiate for people who are not yet born,” Dalinar said. “Nor\ncan I promise my Radiants will follow you, as you cannot promise the\nFused will obey you. As I said, this must be between you and me. But … if\nyou win, I will agree to order my armies to stand down and stop the\nfighting. I will give up the war, and those who wish to join you will be\nallowed to do so.”\n“Not good enough, Dalinar. Not nearly good enough.” Odium took a\nlong, suffering breath. That light pulsed inside of him, and Dalinar felt a\nkind of kinship to the ancient god then. Sensing his fatigue, which\nsomehow mirrored Dalinar’s own. “I want so much more than Roshar, so\nmuch more than one planet, one people. But my people … tire. I’ve worn"

They seek endings, terrible endings. The\nentire war has changed, based on what your wife has done. You realize\nthis.”\n“I do,” Dalinar said.\n“It is time for a true accommodation. A true ending. Do you not agree?”\n“I … Yes. I realize it. What do you propose?”\nOdium waved dismissively at the contract Wit had drawn up. “No more\ntalk of delays, of sending me away. Of half measures. We have a contest of\nchampions on the tenth of next month,” Odium said. “At the tenth hour.”\n“So soon? The month ends tomorrow.”\n“Why delay?” Odium asked. “I know my champion. Do you know\nyours?”\n“I do,” Dalinar said.\n“Then let us stop dancing and commit. On the tenth, our champions\nmeet. If you win, I will withdraw to the kingdoms I currently hold—and I\nenforce an end to the war. I will even give up to you Alethkar, and restore\nyour homeland to you.”\n“I must have Herdaz too.”\n“What?” Odium said. “That meaningless little plot of land? What are\nthey to you?”\n“It’s the matter of an oath, Odium,” Dalinar said. “You will restore to me\nHerdaz and Alethkar. Keep whatever other lands you’ve taken; they mostly\nfollowed you freely anyway. I can accept this, so long as you are still\ntrapped on Roshar, as Honor wished.”\n“I will,” Odium said, “though I will be able to focus my attentions on\nsending agents to the rest of the cosmere, using what I’ve conquered here as\nenough for now. However, if I win the contest of champions, I keep\neverything I’ve conquered—Herdaz and Alethkar included. And I want one\nother small thing. I want you, Dalinar.”\n“My life? Odium, I intend to be my own champion. I’ll have died if you\nwin.”\n“Yes,” Odium said, eyes shining golden. “You will have. And you will\ngive your soul to me. You, Dalinar, will join the Fused. You will become\nimmortal, and will personally serve me. Bound by your oaths. You will be\nthe one I send to the stars to serve my interests in the cosmere.”\nA cold shock ran through Dalinar. Like he’d felt the first time he’d been\nstabbed. Surprise, disbelief, terror.\nYou will join the Fused.\n“Are we agreed?” Odium said, his skin now glowing so brightly that his\nfeatures were difficult to make out. “You have gotten from me more than I\never thought I would give up. Either way, the war ends and you will have\nsecured the safety of your allies. At the cost of gambling your own soul.\nHow far does your honor extend, Blackthorn?”\nDalinar wavered. Stopping now, with Azir and Thaylenah safe—with a\ngood portion of Roshar protected, and with a chance for more in Alethkar\nand Herdaz if he won—was truly more than he ever thought possible. A true\nend to the war."

A true\nend to the war.\nJasnah spoke of the need for councils. Groups of leaders. She thought\nputting too much power in the hands of one individual was dangerous. He\ncould finally see her point, as he stood there on that field of golden light.\nThis new deal would be good for his allies—they’d celebrate it, most likely.\nBut he couldn’t know for certain. He had to make a decision.\nDared he do that? Dared he risk his own soul?\nI have to contain him, Dalinar thought. His people were celebrating their\nvictory in Emul, but he knew—deep down—the enemy had given it away.\nHe had preferred to secure his power elsewhere. The Mink had said it\nhimself: If Odium had wanted to crush Azir, he could have. Instead, he’d\nsecured what he had. Odium knew that in controlling Jah Keved, Alethkar,\nand Iri, he owned the strongest portion of Roshar.\nWithout this deal, Dalinar saw years of fighting ahead. Decades. Against\nan enemy whose Fused were constantly reborn. From years spent defending\nAlethkar, he knew exactly how difficult it would be to retake. Dalinar saw\nhis people dying by the thousands, unsuccessfully trying to seize lands he\nhimself had fortified.\nDalinar would lose this war in the long run. Honor had all but confirmed\nit. Renarin said victory in a traditional sense was nearly impossible as long\nas Odium drove his forces. And Taravangian, whom Dalinar didn’t trust but\ndid believe, had foreseen the same fact. The enemy would win, wearing\nthem down over centuries if need be.\nTheir best chance was for Dalinar’s champion to defeat Odium’s. If that\nchampion failed, then Dalinar’s only reasonable option would be surrender\nanyway. He knew that, deep in his gut. Most importantly, this seemed his\nonly real chance to free Alethkar.\nHe had to do it. He hadn’t achieved what he had through indecision. He\neither trusted his instincts, and the promises of his god, or he had nothing.\nHe took a deep breath. “Final terms are these: A contest of champions to\nthe death. On the tenth day of the month Palah, tenth hour. We each send a\nwilling champion, allowed to meet at the top of Urithiru, otherwise\nunharmed by either side’s forces. If I win that contest, you will remain\nbound to the system—but you will return Alethkar and Herdaz to me, with\nall of their occupants intact. You will vow to cease hostilities and maintain\nthe peace, not working against my allies or our kingdoms in any way.”\n“Agreed,” Odium said. “But if I win, I keep everything I’ve won—\nincluding your homeland. I still remain bound to this system, and will still\ncease hostilities as you said above. But I will have your soul. To serve me,\nimmortal. Will you do this? Because I agree to these terms.”\n“And I,” Dalinar whispered. “I agree to these terms.”\n“It is done.”\nAnd I will march proudly at the head of a human legion."

Before she’d blended her\nessence with the Sibling’s—and gained awareness of the intricate motions\nof the thousands of fabrials that made up the Sibling’s physical form?\nShe now felt so normal. Almost. She retained a hint of awareness in the\nback of her mind. A sense for the veins of crystal that permeated the tower;\nif she rested her hand against a wall she could sense its workings.\nHeat. Pressure. Light. Life.\nI swore I would never do this again, the Sibling said in her mind. I swore\nI was done with humans.\n“Then it’s good that spren, like humans, can change their minds,” Navani\nsaid. She was a little surprised to find her body as she remembered it. With\na cut in her havah, bloodstained where the knife had taken her.\nOur bond is unusual, the Sibling said. I still do not know what I think of\nwhat we’ve done.\n“If we meant our words, and keep them, does it matter?”\nWhat of fabrials? the Sibling asked. You did not promise to stop\ncapturing spren.\n“We will find a compromise,” Navani said, picking her way out of the\nroom with the crystal pillar. “We will work together to find an acceptable\npath forward.”\nWill it be like your compromise with Raboniel, where you tricked her?\n“That was the best compromise she and I could come to, and we both\nknew it,” Navani said. “You and I can do better.”\nI wish to believe you, the Sibling said. But as of yet, I do not. I am sorry.\n“Merely another problem to solve,” Navani said, “through application of\nlogic and hope, in equal measure.”\nShe approached Raboniel’s fallen body in the hallway, then knelt over it.\n“Thank you.”\nThe eyes opened.\nNavani gasped. “Raboniel?”\n“You … lived. Good.” One of her hands twitched; it seemed that Moash\nhad cut her with his Blade low enough that it hadn’t burned out her eyes,\nthough one arm and both legs were obviously dead.\nNavani raised her hand to her lips.\n“Do … not … weep,” Raboniel whispered. “I … would have killed …\nyou … to accomplish … my goal.”\n“Instead, you saved me.”\nRaboniel breathed in a shallow breath, but said nothing.\n“We’ll meet again,” Navani said. “You will be reborn.”\n“No. If I … die … I will return … mad.

Navani rose and\nsearched through the drawers, finding a black sack containing a diamond\nfilled with the precious, terrible Light.\nShe returned and affixed the diamond to the dagger, which was wet with\nMoash’s blood. After cleaning it and reversing the metal strip, she knelt\nbeside Raboniel.\n“Are you sure?” Navani asked.\nRaboniel nodded. Her hand twitched, and Navani reached over and held\nit, which made the Fused relax.\n“I … have done … what I wished. Odium … is worried. He may …\nallow … an ending.…”\n“Thank you,” Navani said softly.\n“I never … thought … I would be sane … at the end.…”\nNavani raised the dagger. And for the first time, she wondered if she was\nstrong enough for this.\n“I do wish…” Raboniel said, “I could hear … rhythms … again.…”\n“Then sing with me,” Navani said, and began to sing Honor’s tone.\nThe Fused smiled, then managed a weak hum to Odium’s tone. Navani\nmodulated her tone, lowering her voice, until the two snapped together in\nharmony one last time.\nNavani positioned the dagger above the wound in Raboniel’s breast.\n“End it … Navani…” Raboniel whispered, letting the song cease. “Make\nsure they let it all … end.”\n“I will,” she whispered back, then—humming her best, holding the hand\nof a former immortal—Navani thrust the dagger in deep. Raboniel’s nerves\nhad mostly been severed, so she didn’t spasm as her daughter had. Her eyes\nwent a glassy marble white, and a breath escaped her lips—black smoke as\nher insides burned away. Navani kept humming until the smoke dissipated.\nYou have performed a kindness, the Sibling said in her head.\n“I feel awful.”\nThat is part of the kindness.\n“I am sorry,” Navani said, “for discovering this Light. It will let spren be\nkilled.”\nIt was coming to us, the Sibling said. Consequences once chased only\nhumans. With the Recreance, the consequences became ours as well. You\nhave simply sealed that truth as eternal.\nNavani pressed her forehead against Raboniel’s as the Fused had done\nfor her daughter. Then she rose, surrounded by exhaustionspren. Storms.\nWithout the Towerlight infusing her, her fatigue returned. How long had it\nbeen since she’d slept?\nToo long. But today, she needed to be a queen. She tucked the dagger\naway—it was too valuable to simply leave lying around—and took her copy\nof Rhythm of War under her arm.\nShe left a note on Raboniel’s corpse, just in case. Do not dispose of this\nhero’s body without first consulting the queen.\nThen she went to create order from the chaos of a tower suddenly set\nfree.\n* * *\nTaravangian awoke late in the day.

And storms, he drew so many\nspren when stupid.\nHe sat beside his fake hearth, and couldn’t help wishing that Dalinar\ncould be there with him. How grand that had been. To have a friend. A real\nfriend who understood him. He trembled at the idea, then began digging in\nthe basket.\nHe stopped as he found a note. Written by Renarin Kholin, sealed by his\nsignet. Taravangian sounded out each glyph. It took forever—drawing a\nfleet of concentrationspren like ripples in the air—for him to figure out what\nit said.\nTwo words. I’m sorry. Two gemstones, glowing brightly, were included\nwith the note. What were these?\nI’m sorry. Why say that? What had the boy seen? He knew his future\nwasn’t to be trusted. Other spren fled, and only fearspren attended him as he\nread those words. He needed to hide! He climbed off his chair and crawled\nto the corner.\nHe quivered there until he felt too hungry. He crawled over and began\neating the flatbread in the basket. Then some kind of purple Azish vegetable\nmash, which he ate with his fingers. It tasted so good. Had he ever eaten\nanything so wonderful? He cried over it.\nThe gemstones continued to glow. Large ones. With something moving\nin them. Hadn’t … hadn’t he been told to watch for something like that?\nThunder crackled in the sky, and Taravangian looked up. Was that the\nEverstorm? No. No, it was a highstorm. He hadn’t realized it would come\ntoday. Thunder rattled the shutters, and he dropped the bread. He hid again\nin the corner with globs of trembling fearspren.\nThe thunder sounded angry.\nHe knows, Taravangian thought. The enemy knows what I’ve done. No.\nNo, wrong storm.\nHe needed a way to summon Odium. Those gems. That was what they\nwere for!\nIt would happen today.\nToday he died.\nToday it ended.\nThe door to his hut slammed open, broken at the hinges. Outside, guards\nscrambled away from a figure silhouetted against a darkening sky. The\nstorm was almost here.\nAnd Szeth had come with it.\nTaravangian gasped, terrified, as this was not the death he had foreseen.\nHe’d waited so long for a transcendent day when he would be supremely\nintelligent again. He’d never wondered about the opposite. A day when he\nwas all emotion. A day when thoughts didn’t move in his brain, and spren\nswarmed him, feeding gluttonously upon his passions."

He could barely understand the words, he was so\nstupid. Emotions fought inside him. Terror. Relief that it would soon be\nover.\n“How did you know my father was dead?” Szeth demanded, striding into\nthe room. “How did you know that Ishar reclaimed his sword? How?”\nSzeth no longer wore white—he’d changed to an Alethi uniform. Why?\nOh, disguise. Yes.\nHe wore the terrible sword at his side. It was too big.

The gemstones. Szeth picked them up,\nfrowning. He hadn’t drawn that terrible sword.\nSay something. What should he say? Szeth couldn’t harm those.\nTaravangian needed them!\n“Please,” he cried, “don’t break them.”\nSzeth scowled, then threw them—one after the other—at the stone wall,\nshattering them. Strange spren escaped, transparent windspren that trailed\nred light. They laughed, spinning around Szeth.\n“Please,” Taravangian said through the tears. “Your sword. Odium. You\n—”\n“Ever you manipulate me,” Szeth interrupted, watching the windspren.\n“Ever you seek to stain my hands with the blood of those you would kill.\nYou brought all this upon us, Taravangian. The world would have been able\nto stand against the enemy if you hadn’t made me murder half their\nmonarchs.”\n“No!” Taravangian said. He stood up with effort, scattering the spren\naround him, his heart thundering in his chest. His vision immediately began\nto swim. He’d stood up too quickly. “We killed to save the world.”\n“Murders done to save lives,” Szeth said softly, tracking Taravangian\nwith eyes dark and shadowed from the room’s poor light, now that the\nspheres were gone. “Idiocy. But I wasn’t ever to object. I was Truthless. I\nsimply followed orders. Tell me.

You are wise for one so stupid.”\nTaravangian tried to dash away past Szeth. But of course his legs gave\nout. He got tripped and collapsed in a heap. He groaned, his heart thumping,\nhis vision swimming.\nA moment later, strong hands lifted him and slammed him back against\nthe wall amid swarming exhaustionspren. Something snapped in\nTaravangian’s shoulder, and pain spiked through his body.\nHe drooped in Szeth’s grip, breathing out in wheezes.\nThe room started to grow golden.\n“All this time,” Szeth said, “I wanted to keep my honor. I tried so hard.\nYou took advantage of that. You broke me, Taravangian.”\nLight. That golden light.\n“Szeth,” Taravangian said, feeling blood on his lips. Storms. “Szeth …\nHe is here.…”\n“I decide now,” Szeth said, reaching toward his waist—not for the\nterrible sword, but for the small knife he was wearing beside it. “I finally\ndecide. Me. No one else compelling me. Taravangian, know that in killing\nyou, I make it my choice.”\nRumbling thunder. A brilliant, terrible golden light. Odium appeared.\nWhen he did, his face was distorted, his eyes shining with angry power.\nThunder broke the landscape, and Szeth began to fade.\nYou should not tempt me today, Taravangian! Odium thundered. I have\nlost my champion AGAIN, and now I am bound by an agreement I do not\nwant. How do they know how to move against me? HAVE YOU BETRAYED ME,\nTARAVANGIAN? Have you been speaking to Sja-anat? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?\nThe awe of that force—that transcendent power—left Taravangian\nquivering, spren of a dozen varieties swirling around him, fighting for his\nattention. So many emotions. He barely noticed Szeth pulling the knife free,\nfor he was so overwhelmed—awed, frightened, excited all at once.\nFear won.\nTaravangian cried out, his shoulder afire with pain, his body broken. His\nplans had been silly. How had he thought to outthink a god when stupid? He\ncouldn’t do that when smart. No wonder he’d failed.\nDid you fail?\nThe sword is here.\nOdium is here.\nCold steel bit Taravangian’s skin as Szeth stabbed him right in the chest.\nAt the same moment, Taravangian felt something pushing through his fear,\nhis pain. An emotion he’d never thought to feel himself. Bravery.\nBravery surged through him, so powerfully he could not help but move.\nIt was the dying courage of a man on the front lines charging an enemy\narmy. The glory of a woman fighting for her child. The feeling of an old\nman on his last day of life stepping into darkness.\nBravery.\nThe Physical Realm faded as Odium pulled Taravangian into the place\nbetween worlds. Taravangian’s body was not as weak here. This form was a\nmanifestation of his mind and soul. And those were strong."

And those were strong.\nThe sword at Szeth’s waist—that strange, terrible sword—manifested\nhere, in this realm where Odium brought Taravangian. The god looked\ndown and saw the curling black darkness, and seemed surprised.\nTaravangian seized the sword and pulled it free of its scabbard, hearing it\nscream for pleasure. He turned and thrust it upward—black smoke curling\naround his hands.\n“Destroy!” the sword bellowed. “DESTROY!”\nTaravangian rammed it up into Odium’s chest.\nThe sword drank greedily of the god’s essence, and as it did,\nTaravangian felt a snap. His body dying. Szeth finishing the job. He knew it\nimmediately. Taravangian was dead. Anger rose in him like he had never\nknown.\nSzeth had killed him!\nOdium screamed, and the golden place shattered, turning to darkness.\nThe sword undulated in Taravangian’s grip, pulling power from the god it\nhad stabbed.\nThe figure that contained Odium’s power—the person who controlled it\n—evaporated, taken by the sword. That alone was so much Investiture that\nTaravangian felt the sword grow dull in his fingers. Full, lethargic. As when\na hot brand was shoved into a barrel of water, there was an initial hiss—but\nthis power was too vast for the sword to drink.\nIt killed the person holding that power, however, which left a hole. A\nneed. A … vacuum, like a gemstone suddenly without Stormlight. It\nreached out, and Taravangian felt a distinct Connection to it.\nPassion. Hatred. Today, Taravangian was only passion. Hatred, fear,\nanger, shame, awe. Bravery. The power loved these things, and it surged\naround him, enveloping him.\nHis soul vibrated.\nTake me, the power pled, speaking not in words, but in emotion. You are\nperfect. I am yours.\nTaravangian hesitated briefly, then thrust his hands into the well of\npower.\nAnd Ascended to godhood, becoming Odium.\nThey should not be discarded, but helped to their potential.

Our bond will be strong, and you will be wondrous. We are awed by\nyou, Rlain. The Bridger of Minds. We are honored.\nHonored. That felt good. To be chosen because of what he’d done.\nKaladin waited for them at the transfer room. He made the transfer with\nthe Sylblade. The air of the Shattered Plains was wetter, and felt … familiar\nto Rlain as they stepped onto a platform outside Narak.\nThere they met with Leshwi and the other four Fused who, upon being\ntransferred here earlier, had regained consciousness. Leshwi hovered over\nand tipped her head toward Kaladin in respect.\n“You could stay here at Narak,” Kaladin said to her. “We’d welcome\nyour aid.”\n“We fought against our own to preserve lives,” Leshwi said. “We do not\nwish that to continue. We will find a third option, outside this war. The path\nof the listeners.”\n“We’ll find our way out here,” Venli said to Confidence. “Somehow.”\n“Well, go with honor then,” Kaladin said. “And with the queen’s\npromise. If you change your minds, or if you and yours need refuge, we’ll\ntake you in.”\nThe Heavenly Ones took to the air, humming to Praise. They began\nlowering the new listeners—and their supplies—down into the chasm for\nthe hike eastward. With the highstorm passed, and with Fused to watch for\nchasmfiends from above, they should be able to make their way to the\neastern flats where the other listeners had gone.\nRlain gave Venli a hug and hummed to Praise.\n“I don’t deserve any of this,” she whispered to him. “I was weak, Rlain.”\n“Then start doing better,” he told her, pulling back. “That is the path of\nRadiance, Venli. We’re both on it now. Write me via spanreed once you find\nthe others, and give my best to Thude and Harvo, if they made it.”\nShe hummed to Appreciation. “You will come to us soon?”\n“Soon,” he promised, then watched her go.\nKaladin stepped up beside Rlain and rested a hand on his shoulder. Rlain\ncouldn’t feel the Plate, though it was apparently always there—invisible,\nbut ready when needed. Like a Shardblade, but made up of many spren.\nKaladin didn’t ask if Rlain wanted to leave with the others. Rlain had\nestablished that he needed to stay, at least until Renarin returned. Beyond\nthat … well, there was something Rlain had started to fear. Something\nnebulous but—once it occurred to him—persistent. If the humans had a\nchance to win this war, but at the expense of taking the minds of all the\nsingers as they’d done in the past, would they take it? Would they enslave\nan entire people again, if given the opportunity?"

Would they enslave\nan entire people again, if given the opportunity?\nThe thought disturbed him. He trusted Kaladin and his friends. But\nhumankind? That was asking a lot. Someone needed to remain close, in\norder to watch and be certain.\nHe would visit the listeners. But he was a Radiant and he was Bridge\nFour. Urithiru was his home.\n“Come on,” Kaladin said. “It’s time to go give Teft a proper send-off.\nAmong friends.”\n* * *\nTaravangian’s vision expanded, his mind expanded, his essence expanded.\nTime started to lose meaning. How long had he been like this?\nHe became the power. With it, he began to understand the cosmere on a\nfundamental level. He saw that his predecessor had been sliding toward\noblivion for a long, long time. Weakened by his battles in the past, then\ndeeply wounded by Honor, this being had been enslaved by the power.\nFailing to claim Dalinar, then losing the tower and Stormblessed, had left\nthe being frail. Vulnerable.\nBut the power was anything but frail. It was the power of life and death,\nof creation and destruction. The power of gods. In his specific case, the\npower of emotion, passion, and—most deeply—the power of raw, untamed\nfury. Of hatred unbound.\nIn this new role, Taravangian had two sides. On one was his knowledge:\nideas, understandings, truths, lies … Thousands upon thousands of possible\nfutures opened up to him. Millions of potentials. So numerous that even his\nexpanded godly mind was daunted by their variety.\nOn the other side was his fury. The terrible fury, like an unbridled storm,\nchurned and burned within him. It too was so overwhelming he could\nbarely control it.\nHe was aware of what he’d left behind in the mortal realm. Szeth had\nlong since climbed to his feet and sheathed Nightblood. Beside him, the\nassassin had found a burned-out corpse, mostly eaten by the sword’s attack.\nThat was Rayse, Taravangian’s predecessor, but Szeth wasn’t able to tell.\nThe sword had consumed clothing and most of the flesh, leaving bits of\nstone-grey bone.\nThey think that’s me, Taravangian thought, reading the possible futures.\nSzeth didn’t see what happened to me spiritually. He doesn’t know Odium\nwas here.\nAlmost all possible futures agreed. Szeth would confess that he’d gone\nto kill Taravangian, but somehow Taravangian had drawn Nightblood—and\nthe weapon had consumed him.\nThey thought him dead. He was free.…\nFree to destroy! To burn! To wreak havoc and terror upon those who had\ndoubted him!\nNo. No, free to plan. To devise a way to save the world from itself. He\ncould see so far! See so much! He needed to think.\nTo burn!\nNo, to plot!\nTo … To …\nTaravangian was startled as he became aware of something else. A\ngrowing power nearby, visible only to one such as him. A godly power,\ninfinite and verdant."

A godly power,\ninfinite and verdant.\nHe was not alone.\n* * *\nThey gave Teft a king’s funeral, Soulcasting him to stone. A sculptor would\nbe commissioned to create a depiction of Phendorana to erect next to him.\nThe Sibling said there was a room, locked away, where the ancient Radiants\nstood forever as stone sentries. It would feel good to see Teft among them,\nin uniform and looking at them all with a scowl, despite the embalmer’s\nbest efforts.\nIt felt right.\nAll of Bridge Four came, except for Rock. Skar and Drehy had relayed\nthe news after returning to the Shattered Plains—it seemed Kaladin\nwouldn’t be seeing Rock again.\nTogether, the men and women of Bridge Four praised Teft, drank to him,\nand burned prayers for him in turn. Afterward, they sought a tavern to\ncontinue celebrating in a way Teft would have loved, even if he wouldn’t\nhave let himself participate.\nKaladin waited as they drifted away. They kept checking on him, of\ncourse, worried for his health. Worried about the darkness. He appreciated\neach and every one of them for it, but he didn’t need that type of help today.\nHe was kind of all right. A good night’s sleep, and finding peace restored\nto the tower, had helped. So he sat there, looking at the statue created from\nTeft’s body. The others finally seemed to sense he needed to be alone. So\nthey left him.\nSyl landed beside him fully sized, in a Bridge Four uniform. He could\nfaintly feel her when she rested her head on his shoulder.\n“We won’t stop missing him, will we?” she asked softly.\n“No. But that’s all right. So long as we cling to the moments we had.”\n“I can’t believe you’re taking this better than I am.”\n“I thought you said you were recovering.”\n“I am,” she said. “This still hurts though.” Once the tower had been\nrestored, she’d mostly returned to herself. Some of what she’d felt had been\ngloom from what Raboniel had done.\nSome of it wasn’t.\n“We could ask Dalinar,” Kaladin said. “If maybe there’s something\nwrong with you. A bond or something unnatural.”\n“He won’t find one. I’m merely … alive. And this is part of being alive.\nSo I’m grateful, even if part of it stinks.”\nHe nodded.\n“Really stinks,” she added. Then for good measure, “Stinks like a human\nafter … how long has it been since you had a bath?”\nHe smiled, and the two of them remained there, looking up at Teft.\nKaladin didn’t know if he believed in the Almighty, or in the Tranquiline\nHalls, or whether people lived after they died. Yes, he’d seen something in a\nvision. But Dalinar had seen many dead people in his visions, and that\ndidn’t mean they still lived somewhere. He didn’t know why Tien had given\nthe wooden horse to him, as if to prove the vision was real, only for it to\nimmediately vanish."

He didn’t know why Tien had given\nthe wooden horse to him, as if to prove the vision was real, only for it to\nimmediately vanish.\nThat seemed to indicate Kaladin’s mind had fabricated the meeting. He\ndidn’t let it prevent him from feeling that he’d accomplished something\nimportant. He’d laid down a heavy burden. The pain didn’t go away, but\nmost of the shame … that he let fall behind him.\nEventually, he stood up and embraced Teft’s statue. Then he wiped his\neyes and nodded to Syl.\nThey needed to keep moving forward. And that involved deciding what\nhe was going to do with himself, now that the crisis had ended.\n* * *\nTaravangian grew more capable by the moment.\nThe power molded him as he bridled it. He stepped to the edge of\ninfinity, studying endless possibilities as if they were a million rising suns\nand he were standing on the bank of an eternal ocean. It was beautiful.\nA woman stepped up beside him. He recognized her full hair, black and\ntightly curled, along with her vibrant round face and dark skin. She had\nanother shape as well. Many of them, but one deeper and truer than the\nothers.\n“Do you understand now?” she asked him.\n“You needed someone who could tempt the power,” Taravangian said,\nhis light gleaming like gold. “But also someone who could control it. I\nasked for the capacity to save the world. I thought it was the intelligence,\nbut later wondered if it was the ability to feel. In the end, it was both. You\nwere preparing me for this.”\n“Odium’s power is the most dangerous of the sixteen,” she said. “It ruled\nRayse, driving him to destroy. It will rule you too, if you let it.”\n“They showed you this possibility, I assume,” Taravangian said, looking\nat infinity. “But this isn’t nearly as … certain as I imagined it. It shows you\nthings that can happen, but not the hearts of those who act. How did you\ndare try something like this? How did you know I’d be up to the\nchallenge?”\n“I didn’t,” she said. “I couldn’t. You were heading this direction—all I\ncould do was hope that if you succeeded, my gift would work. That I had\nchanged you into someone who could bear this power with honor.”\nSuch power. Such incredible power. Taravangian peered into infinity.\nHe’d wanted to save his city, and had succeeded. After that, he’d wanted to\nsave Roshar. He could do that now. He could end this war. Storms, Dalinar\nand Odium’s contract—which bound Taravangian just as soundly—would\ndo that already.\nBut … beyond that, what of the entire cosmere? He couldn’t see that far\nyet. Perhaps he would eventually be able to. But he did know his\npredecessor’s plans, and had access to some of his knowledge. So\nTaravangian knew the cosmere was in chaos. Ruled by fools. Presided over\nby broken gods.\nThere was so much to do. He sorted through Odium’s previous plans and\nsaw all their flaws.

Odium should never have\nentered a deal he could not absolutely control.\nIt can still be done, Taravangian realized, seeing the possibilities—so\nsubtle—that his predecessor had missed. Yes … Dalinar has set himself\nup … to fail. I can beat him.\n“Taravangian,” Cultivation said, holding her hand out to him. “Come.\nLet me teach you about what you’ve been given. I realize the power is\noverwhelming, but you can control it. You can do better than Rayse ever\ndid.”\nHe smiled and took her hand. Inside, he exulted.\nOh, you wonderful creature, he thought. You have no idea what you have\ndone.\nHe was finally free of the frailties of body and position that had always\ncontrolled and defined him.

But I don’t know, Shallan.”\nShallan put down the pen, then took his hands, glancing to the side\nwhere—in their little chamber in Lasting Integrity—her first spren sat on a\nchair, Pattern standing beside her and humming. Had the limp fibers of her\nhead pattern straightened?\nIn talking with Pattern, they’d decided upon an Alethi name for Shallan’s\nprevious Cryptic. One that fit, best they could tell, with the meaning of her\nindividual pattern.\n“Testament does seem better, Adolin,” Shallan said. “Thank you for\nspeaking with her.”\nMaya sat on the floor, cross-legged, in a kind of warrior’s pose. She\nhadn’t recovered completely, but she was improved. And though she still\ndidn’t say much, Shallan doubted many beings—human or spren—had ever\nspoken words quite so valuable as Maya had at the trial. One might say, by\nsimple economics, that Maya was one of the best orators who ever existed.\nIf you aren’t going to say much, then you might as well make what you do\nsay mean something.\nIt gave them hope that whatever Shallan had done to Testament could\nalso be repaired.\n“I’ll try to explain everything Maya and I have done,” Adolin said as\nhonorspren bells rang somewhere near. “But the truth is, I don’t think either\nof us know. And I’m not exactly an expert on all this.”\n“Recent events considered? I think you’re the only expert.” Shallan\nreached up and cupped his face. “Thank you, Adolin.”\n“For?”\n“Being you.

The cube Mraize had sent rested on the other side.\n“The bells are ringing. Time?”\nShe removed her hand and situated herself at the desk. Adolin fell silent,\nwaiting and watching as Shallan lifted the top of Mraize’s cube. With help\nfrom Kelek, they’d gotten it open without harming the thing inside: a spren\nin the shape of a glowing ball of light, a strange symbol at the center. No\none here recognized the variety of spren, but Wit called it a seon.\n“Are you well, Ala?” Shallan asked. It was said like A-lay.\n“Yes,” the spren whispered.\n“You can come out of the cube. You don’t need to live in there\nanymore.”\n“I’m … supposed to stay. I’m not supposed to talk. To you. To anyone.”\nShallan glanced at Adolin. The odd spren resisted attempts to get it free.\nIt acted … like an abused child.\nAnother in the list of Mraize’s crimes, Radiant thought.\nAgreed, Shallan replied.\nRadiant remained. They agreed that once they found the right path, she\nwould eventually be absorbed as Veil had been. For now, Shallan’s wounds\nwere still fresh. Practically bleeding. But what she’d done would finally let\nher begin to heal. And she knew why Pattern had always been so certain she\nwould kill him. And why he’d acted like a newly bonded spren when she’d\nbegun noticing him on the ship with Jasnah. The simple answer was the true\none. He had been newly bonded.\nAnd Shallan had not one Shardblade, but two.\nShe still had questions. Things about her past didn’t completely align\nyet, though her memory was no longer full of holes. There was much they\ndidn’t understand. For example, she was certain that, during the years\nbetween killing Testament and finding Pattern, her powers had still\nfunctioned in some small ways.\nSome of this, Kelek said, had to do with the nature of deadeyes. Before\nthe Recreance, they had never existed. Kelek said he thought this was why\nMraize was hunting him. Something to do with the fall of the singers, and\nthe Knights Radiant, so long ago—and the imprisoning of a specific spren.\n“Contact Mraize please, spren,” she whispered to the ball of light. “It is\ntime.”\nThe ball floated into the air, and the next part took barely a moment. The\nglobe of light shifted to make a version of his face speaking to her. “Little\nknife,” the face said in Mraize’s voice. “I trust the deed has been done?”\n“I did it,” Shallan said. “It hurt so much. But she is gone.”\n“Excellent. That … She, little knife?”\n“Veil and I are one now, Mraize,” Shallan said, resting her hand on her\nnotebook—which contained the fascinating things Kelek had told her about\nother worlds, other planets.

He was convinced that Odium would soon take over the\nworld completely and restart torturing all the Heralds. Kelek would do\npractically anything to escape that fate.\nThere was a long pause from Mraize. “Shallan,” he finally said, “we do\nnot move against other Ghostbloods.”\n“I’m not one of the Ghostbloods,” Shallan said. “None of us ever were,\nnot fully. And now we are stepping away.”\n“Don’t do this. Think of the cost.”\n“My brothers? Is that what you’re referencing? You must know by now\nthat they are no longer in the tower, Mraize.

What power do the Ghostbloods seek\nwith a thing that can bind the minds of an entire people?”\nMraize didn’t respond. The seon, imitating his face, hovered in place.\nExpressionless.\n“I’ll be returning to the tower soon,” Shallan said. “Along with those\nhonorspren who have decided—in light of recent revelations—to bond with\nhumans.

Can you handle my master? Can you handle her master?”\n“Thaidakar?” Shallan guessed.\n“Ah, so you’ve heard of him?”\n“The Lord of Scars, Wit calls him. Well, when you next meet this Lord\nof Scars, give him a message from me.”\n“He comes here in avatar only,” Mraize said. “We are too far beneath his\nlevel to be worthy of more.”\n“Then tell his avatar something for me.

Don’t make me come over there and slap you\naround again.’”\n“So it must be,” Mraize said. “Know that in doing this, you have moved\nagainst the Ghostbloods in the most offensive of ways. We are now at war,\nShallan.”\n“You’ve always been at war,” Shallan said. “I’ve finally picked a side.\nGoodbye, Mraize. End contact.”\nThe floating spren molded into a globe instead of Mraize’s face. Shallan\nsat back, trying not to feel overwhelmed.\n“Whoever they are,” Adolin said, “we can handle them.”\nEver optimistic. Well, he had good reason. With the leaders of the\nhonorspren in disgrace, and Lasting Integrity open again to all who would\nvisit, he had accomplished his mission. He’d been correct all along, both\nabout the honorspren and about Shallan herself.\nShallan reached forward and flipped to the next page in her notebook,\nwhere she’d done a drawing using Kelek’s descriptions. It showed a pattern\nof stars in the sky, and listed the many worlds among them.\nShallan had kept her head down too long. It was time to soar.\n* * *\nThe listeners raised bows toward Venli as she walked up to their camp,\nalone, after insisting that the others stay back a few hundred feet.\nShe didn’t blame the listeners for turning weapons against her. They\nassumed she had come to finish the job she’d started. So she raised her\nhands and hummed to Peace, waiting.\nAnd waiting.\nAnd waiting.\nFinally, Thude himself emerged from behind their fortification of piled\nrocks. Storms, it was good to see him. By the counts they’d done from the\nair, almost all of them must have made it through the narrows and out this\nside. A thousand listener adults, along with many children.\nThude approached, wearing warform, but he stopped short of striking\nrange. Venli continued to stand and hum, feeling a hundred bows focused\non her. This eastern plain beyond the hills was a strange place—so open,\nand full of a surprising amount of grass.\n“Storms. Venli?” Thude turned to dash back behind the fortifications.\nShe realized he must have just now seen her patterns. She was wearing a\nform he’d never known, so of course he hadn’t recognized her from a\ndistance. “Thude!” she called out, taking in enough Stormlight to glow in\nthe daylight. “Thude, please!”\nHe stopped, seeing her Light.\n“Did my mother make it?” she asked to Longing. “Is she alive?”\n“She is,” he called. “But her mind is gone.”\n“I think I might have a way to heal her.”\n“Traitor,” he shouted. “You think I believe you?

Please, listen to\nwhat I have to say.”\nHe wavered, then crossed the stone to meet her. “Do the others know\nwhere we are? Does the enemy know?”\n“I’m not sure,” Venli said. “The humans found you. One Fused knew of\nyou, but she is dead now. I don’t know who she told.”\n“What is a Fused?”\n“There’s a lot you don’t know,” Venli said. “Our gods have returned,\nterrible as warned. I was largely responsible for this, even if Rlain says he’s\ncertain they would have found their way back anyway.”\nThude perked up at Rlain’s name.\n“We’re going to have to do something to protect ourselves,” Venli said.\n“Something to make everyone leave us alone.” She held out her hand, and a\nlittle spren in the shape of a comet flew up from the grass and started\ncircling it. “She’s new to this realm and a little confused. But she’s seeking\nsomeone to bond and make into a Radiant. Like me and my friends.”\n“You came to us last time with a spren who wanted a bond,” Thude said\nto Reprimand. “And what happened?”\n“This will be different,” Venli said, alight with Stormlight. “I’ve\nchanged. I promise you all the time you need to test my words. To decide\nwithout being pushed. For now, please let me see my mother.”\nHe hummed to Winds at last, a sign for her to follow, as he started\nwalking back to camp. Venli attuned Joy.\n“There are more of these spren that will make listeners into Radiants?”\nhe asked.\n“Yes,” she said.\n“How many?”\n“Hundreds,” she said.\nThe Rhythm of Joy grew loud inside Venli as she entered the camp—\nthough many who saw her hummed to Anxiety. She cared for only one\nsight. An old singer woman sitting by a tent made from woven reeds.\nVenli’s heart leaped, and the rhythms sounded more pure. More vibrant.\nJaxlim really was alive. Venli rushed forward, collapsing to her knees\nbefore Jaxlim, feeling as if she were again a child. In the good way.\n“Mother?” she asked.\nJaxlim looked up at her. There was no recognition in the old listener’s\neyes.\n“Without her,” Thude said, stepping up beside Venli, “we’re losing the\nsongs. Nobody else who knew them escaped.…”\n“It’s all right,” Venli said, wiping her tears. “It’s going to be all right.”\nTimbre, within Venli, let out a glorious song.\nVenli held out her hand, and the little lightspren inched into the air, then\nbegan spinning around Venli’s mother. The Reachers were searching for\npeople who exemplified their Ideal: freedom. And the listeners were the\nperfect representation.\nHowever, a Radiant bond required volition, and her mother couldn’t\nspeak Ideals—though the Reachers indicated that the start of the bonding\nprocess didn’t require that.

They also thought becoming Radiant would heal\nher mother, though they couldn’t say for certain. Mental wounds were\ndifficult, they explained, and healing depended greatly on the individual.\nJaxlim could still want this, couldn’t she? She could still choose?\n“Listen, Mother,” Venli pled to Peace. “Hear me. Please.” Venli began\nsinging the Song of Mornings. The first song she’d learned. Her mother’s\nfavorite. As she sang, listeners gathered around, lowering their weapons.\nThey started humming rhythms to match hers.\nWhen she finished, Thude knelt beside her. The little spren had slipped\ninto Jaxlim’s body to seek her gemheart, but no change had happened yet.\nVenli took out a Stormlight sphere, but her mother did not drink it in.\n“It was beautiful,” Thude said. “It’s been too long since I heard one of\nthe songs.”\n“I will restore them to you,” Venli whispered, “if you’ll have me. I\nunderstand completely if you won’t—but I’ve brought other Radiants with\nme, my friends. Along with some of the enemy who have chosen to defect\nand become listeners.”\nThude hummed to Skepticism.\n“Again, if you turn me aside, that is understandable,” Venli said. “But at\nleast listen to my friends. You’re going to need allies to survive in this new\nworld, a world of Surgebinders. We can’t go alone as we did before.”\n“We’re not alone,” Thude said. “I think you’ll find that things have\nchanged for us, as they have for you.”\nVenli hummed to Consideration. Then she heard a scraping sound, like\nrock on rock. Or … claws on rock?\nA shadow fell over Venli, and she started, staring up at a powerful long\nneck with a wicked arrowhead face on the end. A chasmfiend. Here. And no\none was panicking.\nStorms. “That’s…” she whispered. “That’s how you got out of the\nchasms that night, during the storm?”\nThude hummed Confidence.\nBefore she could demand answers, something else interrupted her. A\nvoice.\n“Venli? Venli, is that you?”\nVenli looked down to see that her mother’s eyes had focused, seeing her.\nYour Words, Venli, a distant femalen voice said in her mind, are now\naccepted.\nNearly as much as I look forward to serving you, newest Odium.

That was going to take some getting\nused to.\nKaladin and Syl intended to linger outside the small council room until\nDalinar finished his current meeting, but as soon as he saw them, he broke it\noff and came trotting over.\n“Kaladin,” he said. “I’ve been meaning to speak with you.”\n“You’ve been busy, sir,” Kaladin said. He glanced down at his uniform.\n“Maybe I shouldn’t be wearing this.”\nDalinar actually blushed. What a remarkable sight. “About that,” he said.\n“I should have known I couldn’t—and shouldn’t—try to relieve someone\nlike you from—”\n“Sir,” Kaladin interrupted. He glanced at Syl, who nodded. He turned\nback to Dalinar. “Sir, you were right. I have a lot of healing to do before I\nshould be in command again.”\n“Even still?” Dalinar asked, glancing at Kaladin’s forehead—and the\nmissing brands. “After what you have accomplished? After swearing the\nFourth Ideal?”\n“The Ideals don’t fix us, sir,” Kaladin said. “You know that. We have to\nfix ourselves. Perhaps with a little help.” He saluted. “We were on the\ncorrect path with me, sir. I need to take time away from the battle. Maybe\nso much time that I never return to full command. I have work to do,\nhelping men like me and Dabbid. I’d like your permission to continue.”\n“Granted,” Dalinar said. “You’ve grown, soldier. Few men have the\nwisdom to realize when they need help. Fewer still have the strength to go\nget it. Well done. Very well done.”\n“Thank you, sir,” Kaladin said.\nDalinar hesitated—something seemed to be troubling him. He put his\nhands behind his back, watching Kaladin. Everyone else was celebrating.\nNot Dalinar.\n“What is it, sir?” Kaladin asked.\n“I haven’t made it public knowledge yet, but Odium and I have set a\ntime for our contest of champions.”\n“That’s excellent,” Kaladin said. “How long?”\n“Ten days.”\n“Ten … days?”\nDalinar nodded.\nSyl gasped, and Kaladin felt a spike of alarm. He’d always kind of\nthought … He’d spent this year assuming that …\n“Sir,” Kaladin said. “I can’t…”\n“I know, son,” Dalinar said quietly. “You weren’t right for the champion\njob anyway. This is the sort of thing a man must do himself.”\nKaladin felt cold. Ten days. “The war … Does this mean … it will be\nover?”\n“One way or another, it will end,” Dalinar said. “The terms will enforce\na treaty in ten days, following the contest. The contest will decide the fate\nof Alethkar, among … other items. Regardless, the hostilities will continue\nuntil that day, and so we must remain vigilant.

I don’t know that I understand yet either,\nbut I’m increasingly confident I need to master what I can of my powers.”\n“I don’t know if I can help with that, sir,” Kaladin said. “Though we\nshare a Surge, our abilities seem very different.”\n“Yes, but there is one who can help me. Unfortunately, he’s insane. And\nso, Kaladin, I do not need you as a soldier right now. I need you as a\nsurgeon. You are of the few who personally understand what it means to\nhave your own mind betray you. Would you be willing to go on a mission to\nrecover this individual and find a way to help him, so he can help me?”\n“Of course, sir,” Kaladin said. “Who is it?”\n“The Herald Ishi,” Dalinar said. “Creator of the Oathpact, Herald of\nTruth, and original binder of the Fused.”\nSyl whistled softly.\n“Sir,” Kaladin said, feeling unnerved. “Ten days isn’t enough to help\nsomeone with ordinary battle shock. It will take years, if we can even find\nproper methods. To help a Herald … Well, sir, their problems seem far\nbeyond mine.”\n“I know, soldier,” Dalinar said. “But I think Ishar’s malady is\nsupernatural in nature, and he gave me clues to help him recover. All I need\nfrom you now is an agreement to help. And a willingness to travel to\nShinovar in somewhat … odd company.”\n“Sir?” Kaladin asked.\n“I’ll explain later,” Dalinar said. “I need time to think this over, decide\nwhat I really want to do.”\nKaladin nodded, but glanced at Syl, who whistled again. “Ten days?” she\nsaid. “I guess it’s happening.…”\nDalinar started back toward his meeting—then paused and reached for\nsomething on a nearby table. A flute?\nWit’s flute.\n“Lift had this,” Dalinar said, handing it toward Kaladin. “She said that\nDabbid recognized it as yours.”\n“It is,” Kaladin said with awe. “How is Lift, by the way?”\n“My lunch is gone,” Dalinar said. “So I’d say she’s doing fine. We found\nher spren once the tower was restored, and they have—for some reason—\ndecided to begin carrying around a bright red chicken.” He sighed.\n“Anyway, she said she found that flute in a merchant’s bin down in the\nBreakaway. One who sells salvage from the Shattered Plains. There might\nbe other things your men were forced to abandon there.”\nHuh. “Did she say which merchant?” Kaladin asked.\n* * *\nThe Pursuer drew in a deep, angry breath as he woke.\nThen he screamed in rage.\nIt felt good to have lungs again.

By that Windrunner.\nThat insolent mortal, who thought his victory was due to his skill and not\nraw luck!\nThe Pursuer screamed again, glad for the sound to accompany his fury.\nHis voice echoed; he was someplace dark, but enclosed. That made him\npause. Shouldn’t he … be out in the storm?\n“Are you quite done, Defeated One?” a voice said in their language, but\nwith no rhythm.\nThe Pursuer sat up, twisting to look around. “Who dares call me—” He\ncut off as he saw who stood on the other side of the room, lit only by a\nVoidlight sphere held casually in his hand: a sleek figure looking out a dark\nwindow, his back to the Pursuer. The figure had twisting horns on his head\nand carapace that reflected the light wrong. He always ripped off his natural\ncarapace formations at each rebirth, then replaced them with metal\ninclusions. They were incorporated into his body by Voidlight healing and\nhis own special talents.\nEl. The one with no title.\nThe Pursuer silenced himself. He didn’t fear this Fused. He feared no\none. But … to El, he did not complain.\n“Where am I?” the Pursuer asked instead. “Why have I been reborn so\nquickly? I was on Braize for barely a day before I felt the pull.”\n“We didn’t want to wait,” El said softly, still facing away from the\nPursuer. No rhythms. El was forbidden rhythms. “So we had it done the old\nway. The way before the storms.”\n“I thought Odium wasn’t doing that any longer.”\n“Our new god made an exception, Defeated One.”\nThe Pursuer grunted, picking himself up off the ground. “They gave\nyour title to another, you know. A human.”\n“I’ve heard.”\n“Disrespectful,” the Pursuer said to Derision. “It should have remained\nunused. Give me that Voidlight. I need to recharge myself, to earn back my\nlegacy.”\n“Earn back?”\nThe Pursuer forced himself to keep his tone respectful, to not shout. The\none with no title could be … difficult. “I will hunt the mortal who killed\nme,” the Pursuer said. “I will kill him, and then anyone he ever loved. I will\nmurder mortal after mortal until my vengeance is recognized, my atonement\nmade. I assume you all know this, if you couldn’t wait for me to be reborn.\nSo give me that damn Voidlight.”\nEl turned, smiling in the shadows. “It is for you, Lezian.”\n“Excellent,” the Pursuer said, stalking forward.\n“But you mistook me,” El said. “When we said we did not want to have\nto wait for your rebirth, it was not your convenience that troubled us, but\nmine. I am very curious, you see, and you were the sole appropriate\nsubject.”\n“Subject for what?” the Pursuer asked, reaching the window and looking\nout over Kholinar at night.\n“Oh, to see if this really works.” El raised the Voidlight sphere … and\nthe Pursuer saw it was attached to a knife. Did the Light look wrong\nsomehow? Warping the air around the gemstone?"

The transformation the tower had undergone\nalready was amazing. The air had become as warm as it was in Azir, an\nenvelope of temperate weather that extended out to the fields.\nPeople breathed more easily now. The entire tower was not only properly\nventilated, it had water running through hidden pipes into many rooms, like\nthey had in rich cities such as Kharbranth. And that was just the beginning.\nWhile some rooms in the tower had once held normal wooden doors, many\nothers had stone doors that opened to the touch. They hadn’t realized how\nmany rooms they’d missed while exploring because they’d been closed\nwhen the tower had last shut down. The place was truly a wonder.\nHe finally found the merchant shop Lift had told Dalinar about. Though\nthe hour was growing late, the market was busy with people celebrating, so\na lot of the shops were open, this one included. Kaladin was directed to a\nbin of salvage, and he began rifling through it, Syl on his shoulder. He\nfound Rock’s razor. And some of Sigzil’s brushpens. And …\nHe held up a miniature wooden horse, carved in exacting detail.\nSyl breathed out an awed sound.\n“I lost this before coming to the Shattered Plains,” Kaladin said. “I lost\nthis in Alethkar. Tien gave it to me the day we were recruited into the army,\nand it was taken with my other things when I became a slave. How…”\nHe clutched the horse close to his chest. He was so amazed that he\nwalked off, and had to come running back to pay for what he’d taken. After\nthat, he trotted back toward the tavern. He’d promised earlier that he would\nmeet Dabbid, Noril, and the others he’d rescued from the monastery sick\nrooms, to decompress from yesterday’s events.\nKaladin would do as Dalinar asked, and go to save the Herald Ishi. That\nwas for tomorrow, however. Today, Kaladin had another promise to keep.\nAfter all, he’d told Teft he would join these meetings and start taking care\nof himself.\n* * *\nDalinar felt energized as he smelled the crisp cool air of the mountains. He\nstood at the very top of the tower, drinking it in while holding Navani, her\nwarmth pressed against him. The sun had set, and he’d had enough of\nreports for the day. He wanted time with his wife and to look at the stars.\n“I should have known you’d find a way out of it on your own,” he\nwhispered to Navani as Nomon bathed them in light. “I should have seen\nyour potential.”\nShe squeezed his arms. “I didn’t see it either. I spent a long time refusing\nto do so.”"

Not angry rumbling though.\nMore … contemplative.\n“The Stormfather doesn’t know what to make of this,” Dalinar said. “I\nthink he finds it strange. Apparently, his Bondsmith and the Nightwatcher’s\nBondsmith sometimes had relationships, but the Sibling’s Bondsmith was\nalways apart.”\n“The Sibling is … curious that way,” Navani said. “I’ll introduce you,\nonce they are ready. It might take them time.”\n“As long as it’s within ten days,” Dalinar said. “I can’t guarantee what\nwill happen after then.”\n“That deal you made…” she said.\n“I’m sorry. I had to make an agreement while I had him. It isn’t\neverything we wanted, but—”\n“It’s a good deal, Dalinar,” Navani said. “Inspired, even. We will have\npeace, even if we have to give up Alethkar. I think we’ve all been coming to\nrealize that was a probability. Instead, this gives us a chance. I just wish …\nThat last bit you agreed to. That worries me.”\nHe nodded. “Yes,” he whispered. “I know.”\nThis was his job though. To sacrifice himself, if need be, for everyone\nelse. In that … In that Taravangian was right.\nIt still felt so wrong for Taravangian to be dead. Dalinar would never\nhave a chance to prove to Taravangian that Dalinar’s way was correct.\nGone. Without a farewell. Burned away in another stupid plot to manipulate\nSzeth.\n“At least we can stop the bloodshed,” Navani said. “Tell our troops to\nhold position and wait for the contest.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said.\nUnless … Should Dalinar have insisted the contest happen sooner? He\ndidn’t feel ready. But would he ever?\nSomething feels wrong, he thought. Something has changed. We need to\nbe ready for these next ten days. He felt that truth like a twisting in his\nstomach.\n“I feel your tension,” Navani said.\n“I’m second-guessing what I’ve done,” Dalinar said.\n“The best information we have indicates this contest is our most\nreasonable hope of success,” Navani said. “And I doubt anyone the enemy\npresents can best Stormblessed.”\n“I’m … not going to pick Kaladin, gemheart.”\n“Why?” Navani asked. “He’s our best warrior.”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “He’s our best soldier. But even if he were in peak\nfighting shape, I don’t think he’d be our best warrior. Or our best killer.\n“Wit says the enemy can’t violate our agreement, and isn’t likely to try\nto misinterpret it—not intentionally. In fact, Wit seems to think the victory\nis already ours, but he got what he wanted. Odium will remain trapped\neither way. I’m worried though. There’s more I’m missing; I’m sure of it.

We will find a way to live in\nthis new world, with the singers in their lands, and humans in ours.”\nNavani squeezed his arm again, and he took a deep breath, intent on\nenjoying this moment. Storms, it felt good to be holding her. Beneath them,\nthe tower’s lights shone brightly in the night—and down in the corridors, it\nwas positively warm. He’d had to come all the way up here to smell\nmountain air.\n“I should have known,” Dalinar repeated. “About you.”\n“I don’t think so,” Navani said. “It was a remarkable stroke of luck that I\nfigured it all out.”\n“Not luck,” Dalinar said. “Conviction. Brilliance. I was scared for you,\nbut should have remembered when I was scared of you—and realized how\nmuch danger the Fused were in by trying to take your fabrials from you.\nYou are incredible. You’ve always been incredible.”\nShe breathed out a long, contented sigh.\n“What?” he said.\n“It’s good to hear someone say that.”\nHe held her for an extended moment of peace. But eventually, their\ncrowns came calling. People came looking for Navani to settle something\nregarding the tower, and she was forced to leave.\nDalinar lingered on the top of the tower. He settled down on the edge,\nputting his legs over the side—the place where Kaladin had reportedly leapt\ninto the darkness of the storm.\nYou were wise to give the Windrunner more time during his fall, the\nStormfather said, approaching Dalinar. You were wise to show … mercy.\n“It’s an important concept to learn,” Dalinar said to him. “The more you\nstudy it, the more human you will become.”\nI do not wish to become human, the Stormfather said. But perhaps I can\nlearn. Perhaps I can change.\n“That’s all it takes,” Dalinar said. “A willingness.”\nYou are wrong though. I do understand mercy. I have expressed it, on\noccasion.\n“Really?” Dalinar said, curious. “When?”\nFOURTEEN MONTHS AGO\nEshonai hit the ground of the chasm in a furious splash. Above, the battle\nfor Narak continued, and the rest of the listeners summoned the Everstorm.\nShe should be leading them! She was foremost among them! She leaped\nto her feet and shouted to a dozen horrible rhythms in a row, her voice\nechoing in the chasm. It did no good. She had been defeated by the human\nShardbearer, sent tumbling into the chasms.\nShe needed to get out of here and find the fight again. She started\ntrudging forward. Though the water came up to her waist, the flow was not\nswift. It was merely a constant, steady stream from the Weeping—and in\nShardplate she was able to walk against the current.

That was the Everstorm coming, wasn’t it? Yes,\nshe could feel its power, its energy, its beauty. But there was something\nelse.\nListening to the howling wind, she realized what it was. A second storm.\nA highstorm was coming as well.\nShe attuned the Rhythm of Panic.\nThe two storms clashed, making the very ground tremble.\nClinging to the wall within the chasm, Eshonai felt the wind howling\nabove. The lightning made her feel like she was blinking her eyes quickly,\nlight and darkness alternating.\nThen she heard a roar. The terrible sound of water surging through the\nchasm, becoming an incredible wave. She braced herself, but when the\nwater hit, it ripped her off the wall.\nIt was here, within these highstorm rainwaters, that Eshonai’s first battle\nbegan: the fight for survival.\nShe slammed into a rock, her helmet cracking. Escaping Stormlight lit\nthe dark waters as they filled her helmet, suffocating her. She thrashed in\nthe current and managed to grab something hard—an enormous boulder\nlodged into the center of the chasm.\nWith a heave, she pulled herself out of the water. A few precious\nmoments later her helmet emptied, letting her gasp for air.\nI’m going to die, she thought, the Rhythm of Destruction pounding in her\nears. Water thundered around her, splashing her armor, and lightning\nspasmed in the sky above. I’m going to die … as a slave.\nNo.\nAn ember within Eshonai came alive. The part of herself she’d reserved,\nthe part that would not be contained. The part that made her let Thude and\nthe others escape. It was the core of who she was: a person who had insisted\non leaving the camps to explore, a person who had always longed to see\nwhat was over the next hill.\nA person who would not be held captive.\nThat was when her second battle began.\nEshonai screamed, trying to banish the Rhythm of Destruction. If she\nwas to die here, she would die as herself! It was a highstorm. In highstorms,\ntransformations came upon all people, listeners and humans alike. Within a\nhighstorm, death walked hand in hand with salvation, singing a harmony."

Not your rhythms.\nI reject you.\nMy life. My death.\nI WILL BE FREE.\nSunken deep in the water, Eshonai summoned her Blade and rammed it\ninto the chasm wall. For some reason, she thought she could hear its voice,\nfar away. Screaming?\nShe clung to it anyway—holding steady before the current. She banished\nall rhythms, but she could not breathe. Darkness began to close in upon her.\nHer lungs stopped burning. As if … as if everything was going to be all\nright …\nThere. A tone. The strange, haunting one she’d heard when taking\nwarform. It seemed … one of the pure tones of Roshar. It began a stately\nrhythm. Then a second tone, chaotic and angry, appeared beside it. The two\ndrew closer, closer, then snapped together.\nThey melded into harmony, making a song of Honor and Odium both. A\nsong for a singer who could fight, but also for a soldier who wanted to lay\ndown her sword. She found this tone as, in the blackness, a small spren—\nshaped like a shooting star—appeared ahead of her.\nEshonai strained, reaching, clawing.\nHer head came above water, and then her helm blessedly emptied. The\nrush of the river was slowing. She gasped sweet air, but then her hand\nslipped from her sword, and she slipped back under the water and was\ntowed away—though with less force than before.\nShe attuned the rhythm. The Rhythm of War, the rhythm of victories and\nlosses. The rhythm of a life at its end. To its beats, she resummoned her\nBlade and rammed it into the ground, holding it tightly as the waters slowed\nfurther.\nShe would not die. She would live. She was strong enough. Her journey\nwas not at an end. Not. Yet.\nShe held on, belligerent, until the water slowed. Until the weight of her\nPlate was enough to resist the current without her effort, and she slumped\nagainst the bottom of the chasm, her back to the wall, water streaming over\nher.\nShe felt at her side, where the Plate had broken—as had her body. She\nbled from a deep gash here, her carapace ripped away. Each breath came as\na ragged, sodden mess, and she tasted blood.\nBut in her mind, she cycled through the rhythms of her childhood. Awe.\nConfidence. Mourning. Determination. Then Peace.\nShe had lost the first battle.\nBut she had won the second.\nAnd so, to the Rhythm of Victory, she closed her eyes.

It rumbled with\nthe sound of a thousand storms, echoing through her. SO YOU PERSIST. FOR A\nSHORT TIME.\nInvested? Eshonai thought.\nYOU WERE RADIANT WHEN YOU DIED. YOU COULDN’T SAY THE WORDS,\nUNDER THE WATER, BUT I ACCEPTED THEM ANYWAY. HOW DO YOU THINK YOU\nSURVIVED THAT LONG WITHOUT BREATHING?\nShe floated. So … this is my soul?\nSOME WOULD CALL IT THAT, said the Rider of Storms. SOME WOULD SAY IT\nIS A SPREN FORMED BY THE POWER YOU LEFT, IMPRINTED WITH YOUR MEMORIES.\nEITHER WAY, THIS IS THE END. YOU WILL PASS INTO ETERNITY SOON, AND EVEN I\nCANNOT SEE WHAT IS BEYOND.\nHow long? Eshonai asked.\nMINUTES. NOT HOURS.\nShe had no eyes to close, but she relaxed in the light. Floating. She could\nhear the rhythms. All of them at once, with accompanying songs.\nWhat did it mean, then? she asked as she waited. Life.\nMEANING IS A THING OF MORTALS, the Rider said. IT IS NOT A THING OF\nSTORMS.\nThat’s sad.\nIS IT? he asked. I SHOULD THINK IT ENCOURAGING. MORTALS SEARCH FOR\nMEANING, SO IT IS PROPER THEY SHOULD CREATE IT. YOU GET TO DECIDE WHAT IT\nMEANT, ESHONAI. WHAT YOU MEANT.\nIf I decide, then I failed, she thought. I gave my people to the enemy. I\ndied alone, defeated. I betrayed the gift of my ancestors. I am a shame to all\nprevious listeners.\nI WOULD THINK THE OPPOSITE, the Rider said. IN THE END, YOU MADE THE\nSAME CHOICE AS YOUR ANCESTORS. YOU GAVE AWAY POWER FOR FREEDOM. YOU\nKNOW THOSE ANCIENT LISTENERS AS FEW EVER HAVE, OR EVER WILL.\nThat gave her peace as she felt her essence begin to stretch. As if it were\nmoving toward something distant.\nThank you, she said to the Rider.\nI DID NOTHING. I WATCHED YOU FALL AND DID NOT STOP IT.\nThe rain cannot stop the bloodshed, she said, fading. But it washes the\nworld afterward anyway. Thank you.\nI COULD HAVE DONE MORE, the Rider replied. PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE.\nIt … is enough.…\nNO, he said. I CAN GIVE YOU ONE FINAL GIFT.\nEshonai stopped stretching, and instead found herself pulled toward\nsomething powerful. She had no eyes, but she suddenly had an awareness—\nthe storm. She had become the storm. She felt every rumble of thunder as\nher heartbeat.\nWATCH, the Rider said. YOU WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS BEYOND THE\nNEXT HILL. SEE THEM ALL.\nShe soared with him, enveloping the land, flying above it. Her rain\nbathed each and every hill, and the Rider let her see the world with the eyes\nof a god. Everywhere the wind blew, she was. Everything the rain touched,\nshe felt. Everything the lightning revealed, she knew."

She saw the captive parshmen\n—but saw the hope for their freedom. She saw creatures, plants, chasms,\nmountains, snows … she passed it all. Everything.\nThe entire world. She saw it. Every little piece was a part of the rhythms.\nThe world was the rhythms. And Eshonai, during that transcendent ride,\nunderstood how it fit together.\nIt was wonderful.\nWhen the Rider finished his passage—exhausted and limping as he\npassed into the ocean beyond Shinovar—she felt him let go. She faded, but\nthis time she felt her soul vibrating. She understood the rhythms as no one\never could without having seen the world as she had.\nFAREWELL, ESHONAI, the Rider of Storms said. FAREWELL, RADIANT.\nBursting with songs, Eshonai let herself pass into the eternities, excited\nto discover what lay on the other side.\nWit strolled the hallways of Elhokar’s old palace on the Shattered Plains,\nsearching for an audience. He flipped a coin in the air, then caught it before\nsnapping his hand forward and spreading his fingers to show that the coin\nhad vanished. But of course it was secretly in his other hand, palmed,\nhidden from sight.\n“Storytelling,” he said to the hallway, “is essentially about cheating.”\nHe tucked the coin into his belt with a quick gesture, keeping up the\nflourishes of his other hand as a distraction. In a moment he could present\nboth hands empty before him. He added to the theatrics by pushing back his\nsleeves.\n“The challenge,” he said, “is to make everyone believe you’ve lived a\nthousand lives. Make them feel the pain you have not felt, make them see\nthe sights you have not seen, and make them know the truths that you have\nmade up.”\nThe coin appeared in his hand, though he’d simply slipped it out of his\nbelt again. He rolled it across his knuckles, then made it split into two—\nbecause it had always been two coins stuck together. He tossed those up,\ncaught them, and then made them appear to be four after adding the two\nhe’d been palming in his other hand.\n“You use the same dirty tricks for storytelling,” Wit said, “as you do for\nfighting in an alley. Get someone looking the wrong direction so you can\nclock them across the face. Get them to anticipate a punch and brace\nthemselves, so you can reposition. Always hit them where they aren’t\nprepared.”\nWith a flourish, he presented both hands forward, empty again. On his\ncoat, Design made a peppy humming sound. “I found one!” she said. “In\nyour belt!”\n“Hush,” Wit said. “Let the audience be amazed.”\n“The audience?”\nWit nodded to the side, where a few odd spren were following in the air.\nAlmost invisible, and trailing red light. Windspren—but the wrong color."

Windspren—but the wrong color.\nShe was expanding her influence, that old one was. He was curious where it\nwould lead. Also horrified. But the two emotions were not mutually\nexclusive.\n“I don’t think they care about your tricks,” Design said.\n“Everyone cares about my tricks.”\n“But you can make the coins vanish with Lightweaving,” she said. “So it\ndoesn’t matter how many you hide in your belt. And if you do something\namazing, everyone will assume it was done with Surgebinding!”\nWit sighed, tossing four coins in the air, then catching them and\npresenting one solitary coin.\n“They don’t even use those for money here,” Design added. “So you’ll\nonly distract them. Use spheres.”\n“Spheres glow,” Wit said. “And they’re tough to palm.”\n“Excuses.”\n“My life is only excuses.” He wound the coin across his knuckles. “The\nillusion without Lightweaving is superior, Design.”\n“Because it’s fake?”\n“Because the audience knows it’s fake,” Wit said. “When they watch and\nlet themselves be amazed, they are joining in the illusion. They’re giving\nyou something vital. Something powerful. Something essential. Their\nbelief.\n“When you and the audience both start a performance knowing that a lie\nis going to be presented, their willing energy vibrates in tune with yours. It\npropels you. And when they walk away at the end, amazed but knowing\nthey’ve been lied to—with their permission—the performance lingers in\ntheir minds. Because the lie was real somehow. Because they know that if\nthey were to rip it apart, they could know how it was done. They realize\nthere must have been flaws they could have caught. Signs. Secrets.”\n“So … it’s better…” Design said, “because it’s worse than an illusion\nusing real magic?”\n“Exactly.”\n“That’s stupid.”\nWit sighed. He bounced his coin off the ground with a metallic pling,\nthen caught it. “Would you go bother someone else for a while?”\n“Okay!” Design said excitedly. She moved off his coat and to the floor,\nthen zipped away. His audience of corrupted windspren trailed after her.\nTraitors.\nWit started down a side hallway, but then felt something. A tingling that\nmade his Breaths go wild.\nAh … he thought. He’d been expecting this; it was why he had left the\ntower, after all. Odium couldn’t find him there.\nHe hiked to Elhokar’s former sitting room and made himself available—\nvisible, easy to reach. Then, when the presence entered the nondescript\nstone chamber, Wit bowed.\n“Welcome, Rayse!” Wit said. “It’s been not nearly long enough.”\nI noticed your touch on the contract, a dramatic voice said in his head.\n“You’ve always been a clever one,” Wit said. “Was it my diction that\nclued you in, my keen bargaining abilities, or the fact that I included my\nname in the text?”\nWhat game do you play here?\n“A game of sense.”\n… What?\n“Sense, Odium.

If you were in my\nplace?\n“Why does it matter?” Wit asked.\nHumor me.\nWit cocked his head. There was something odd about this change in tone\nfrom Odium. Asking whom Wit would choose? Rayse wouldn’t care to\nknow.\nNever mind, Odium said quickly. It matters not. Whomever I pick, they\nwill destroy Dalinar’s champion! Then I will use him, and my minions on\nthis planet, to finally do whatever I wish!\n“Yes, but where will you find that many willing horses…” Wit said,\ncontinuing on his way out the door. He started whistling as Odium’s\npresence remained behind. That had gone exactly as he’d imagined. Except\nthat last part. He slowed, turning the words over in his mind.\nWas Rayse growing more thoughtful? Wit didn’t need to worry, did he?\nAfter all this, Odium would be safely imprisoned, no matter what happened.\nThere was no way out.…\nUnless …\nWit’s breath caught, but then he forced himself to keep whistling and\nwalking.\nA power slammed into him from behind. A golden energy, infinite and\ndeadly. Wit’s eyes went wide, and he gasped, sensing something horribly\nwrong about that power.\nI have made an error, I see, the power said, soft and thoughtful. I am new\nto this. I should not have pushed for information. It’s all about giving you\nwhat you expect. Even a being thousands of years old can be tricked. I\nknow this from personal experience now.\n“Who are you?” Wit whispered.\nOdium, the power said. Let me see … I cannot harm you. But here, you\nhave used this other Investiture to store your memories, haven’t you?\nBecause you’ve lived longer than a mortal should, you need to put the\nexcess memories somewhere. I can’t see your mind, but I can see these,\ncan’t I?\nFor the first time in a long, long while, Wit felt true terror.

Bound together, these form the Double\nEye of the Almighty, an eye with two pupils representing the creation of\nplants and creatures. This is also the basis for the hourglass shape that was\noften associated with the Knights Radiant.\nAncient scholars also placed the ten orders of Knights Radiant on this\nlist, alongside the Heralds themselves, who each had a classical association\nwith one of the numbers and Essences.\nI’m not certain yet how the ten levels of Voidbinding or its cousin the\nOld Magic fit into this paradigm, if indeed they can. My research suggests\nthat, indeed, there should be another series of abilities that is even more\nesoteric than the Voidbindings. Perhaps the Old Magic fits into those,\nthough I am beginning to suspect that it is something entirely different.\nNote that I currently believe the concept of the “Body Focus” to be more\na matter of philosophical interpretation than an actual attribute of this\nInvestiture and its manifestations.\nTHE TEN SURGES\nAs a complement to the Essences, the classical elements celebrated on"

These, thought to be the fundamental\nforces by which the world operates, are more accurately a representation of\nthe ten basic abilities offered to the Heralds, and then the Knights Radiant,\nby their bonds.\nAdhesion: The Surge of Pressure and Vacuum\nGravitation: The Surge of Gravity\nDivision: The Surge of Destruction and Decay\nAbrasion: The Surge of Friction\nProgression: The Surge of Growth and Healing, or Regrowth\nIllumination: The Surge of Light, Sound, and Various Waveforms\nTransformation: The Surge of Soulcasting\nTransportation: The Surge of Motion and Realmatic Transition\nCohesion: The Surge of Strong Axial Interconnection\nTension: The Surge of Soft Axial Interconnection\nON THE CREATION OF FABRIALS\nFive groupings of fabrial have been discovered so far. The methods of their\ncreation are carefully guarded by the artifabrian community, but they appear\nto be the work of dedicated scientists, as opposed to the more mystical\nSurgebindings once performed by the Knights Radiant. I am more and more\nconvinced that the creation of these devices requires forced enslavement of\ntransformative cognitive entities, known as “spren” to the local\ncommunities.\nALTERING FABRIALS\nAugmenters: These fabrials are crafted to enhance something. They can\ncreate heat, pain, or even a calm wind, for instance. They are powered—like\nall fabrials—by Stormlight. They seem to work best with forces, emotions,\nor sensations.\nThe so-called half-shards of Jah Keved are created with this type of\nfabrial attached to a sheet of metal, enhancing its durability. I have seen\nfabrials of this type crafted using many different kinds of gemstone; I am\nguessing that any one of the ten Polestones will work.\nDiminishers: These fabrials do the opposite of what augmenters do, and\ngenerally seem to fall under the same restrictions as their cousins. Those\nartifabrians who have taken me into confidence seem to believe that even\ngreater fabrials are possible than what have been created so far, particularly\nin regard to augmenters and diminishers.\nPAIRING FABRIALS\nConjoiners: By infusing a ruby and using methodology that has not been\nrevealed to me (though I have my suspicions), you can create a conjoined\npair of gemstones. The process requires splitting the original ruby. The two\nhalves will then create parallel reactions across a distance. Spanreeds are\none of the most common forms of this type of fabrial.\nConservation of force is maintained; for instance, if one is attached to a\nheavy stone, you will need the same strength to lift the conjoined fabrial\nthat you would need to lift the stone itself. There appears to be some sort of\nprocess used during the creation of the fabrial that influences how far apart\nthe two halves can go and still produce an effect.\nReversers: Using an amethyst instead of a ruby also creates conjoined\nhalves of a gemstone, but these two work in creating opposite reactions.\nRaise one, and the other will be pressed downward, for instance."

There appear to be some\nunexpected limitations to this form of fabrial, though I have not been able\nto discover what they are.\nWARNING FABRIALS\nThere is only one type of fabrial in this set, informally known as the Alerter.\nAn Alerter can warn one of a nearby object, feeling, sensation, or\nphenomenon. These fabrials use a heliodor stone as their focus. I do not\nknow whether this is the only type of gemstone that will work, or if there is\nanother reason heliodor is used.\nIn the case of this kind of fabrial, the amount of Stormlight you can\ninfuse into it affects its range. Hence the size of gemstone used is very\nimportant.\nWINDRUNNING AND LASHINGS\nReports of the Assassin in White’s odd abilities have led me to some\nsources of information that, I believe, are generally unknown. The\nWindrunners were an order of the Knights Radiant, and they made use of\ntwo primary types of Surgebinding. The effects of these Surgebindings were\nknown—colloquially among the members of the order—as the Three\nLashings.\nBASIC LASHING: GRAVITATIONAL CHANGE\nThis type of Lashing was one of the most commonly used Lashings among\nthe order, though it was not the easiest to use. (That distinction belongs to\nthe Full Lashing below.) A Basic Lashing involved revoking a being’s or\nobject’s spiritual gravitational bond to the planet below, instead temporarily\nlinking that being or object to a different object or direction.\nEffectively, this creates a change in gravitational pull, twisting the\nenergies of the planet itself. A Basic Lashing allowed a Windrunner to run\nup walls, to send objects or people flying off into the air, or to create similar\neffects. Advanced uses of this type of Lashing would allow a Windrunner to\nmake himself or herself lighter by binding part of his or her mass upward.\n(Mathematically, binding a quarter of one’s mass upward would halve a\nperson’s effective weight. Binding half of one’s mass upward would create\nweightlessness.)\nMultiple Basic Lashings could also pull an object or a person’s body\ndownward at double, triple, or other multiples of its weight.\nFULL LASHING: BINDING OBJECTS TOGETHER\nA Full Lashing might seem very similar to a Basic Lashing, but they\nworked on very different principles. While one had to do with gravitation,\nthe other had to do with the force (or Surge, as the Radiants called them) of\nAdhesion—binding objects together as if they were one. I believe this Surge\nmay have had something to do with atmospheric pressure.\nTo create a Full Lashing, a Windrunner would infuse an object with\nStormlight, then press another object to it. The two objects would become\nbound together with an extremely powerful bond, nearly impossible to\nbreak. In fact, most materials would themselves break before the bond\nholding them together would.\nREVERSE LASHING: GIVING AN OBJECT A GRAVITATIONAL PULL"

In fact, most materials would themselves break before the bond\nholding them together would.\nREVERSE LASHING: GIVING AN OBJECT A GRAVITATIONAL PULL\nI believe this may actually be a specialized version of the Basic Lashing.\nThis type of Lashing required the least amount of Stormlight of any of the\nthree Lashings. The Windrunner would infuse something, give a mental\ncommand, and create a pull to the object that yanked other objects toward\nit.\nAt its heart, this Lashing created a bubble around the object that imitated\nits spiritual link to the ground beneath it. As such, it was much harder for\nthe Lashing to affect objects touching the ground, where their link to the\nplanet was strongest. Objects falling or in flight were the easiest to\ninfluence. Other objects could be affected, but the Stormlight and skill\nrequired were much more substantial.\nLIGHTWEAVING\nA second form of Surgebinding involves the manipulation of light and\nsound in illusory tactics common throughout the cosmere. Unlike the\nvariations present on Sel, however, this method has a powerful Spiritual\nelement, requiring not just a full mental picture of the intended creation, but\nsome level of Connection to it as well. The illusion is based not simply\nupon what the Lightweaver imagines, but upon what they desire to create.\nIn many ways, this is the most similar ability to the original Yolish\nvariant, which excites me. I wish to delve more into this ability, with the\nhope to gain a full understanding of how it relates to cognitive and spiritual\nattributes.\nSOULCASTING\nEssential to the economy of Roshar is the art of Soulcasting, in which one\nform of matter is directly transformed into another by changing its spiritual\nnature. This is performed on Roshar via the use of devices known as\nSoulcasters, and these devices (the majority of which appear to be focused\non turning stone into grain or flesh) are used to provide mobile supply for\narmies or to augment local urban food stores. This has allowed kingdoms\non Roshar—where fresh water is rarely an issue, because of highstorm rains\n—to field armies in ways that would be unthinkable elsewhere.\nWhat intrigues me most about Soulcasting, however, are the things we\ncan infer about the world and Investiture from it. For example, certain\ngemstones are requisite in producing certain results—if you wish to\nproduce grain, your Soulcaster must both be attuned to that transformation\nand have an emerald (not a different gemstone) attached. This creates an\neconomy based on the relative values of what the gemstones can create, not\nupon their rarity. Indeed, as the chemical structures are identical for several\nof these gemstone varieties, aside from trace impurities, the color is the\nmost important part—not their actual axial makeup. I’m certain you will\nfind this relevance of hue quite intriguing, particularly in its relationship to\nother forms of Investiture.\nThis relationship must have been essential in the local creation of the\ntable I’ve included above, which lacks some scientific merit, but is\nintrinsically tied to the folklore surrounding Soulcasting. An emerald can be\nused to create food—and thus is traditionally associated with a similar\nEssence. Indeed, on Roshar there are considered to be ten elements; not the\ntraditional four or sixteen, depending upon local tradition."

Indeed, on Roshar there are considered to be ten elements; not the\ntraditional four or sixteen, depending upon local tradition.\nCuriously, these gemstones seem tied to the original abilities of the\nSoulcasters who were an order of Knights Radiant—but they don’t seem\nessential to the actual operation of the Investiture when performed by a\nliving Radiant. I do not know the connection here, though it implies\nsomething valuable.\nSoulcasters, the devices, were created to imitate the abilities of the Surge\nof Soulcasting (or Transformation). This is yet another mechanical\nimitation of something once available only to a select few within the\nbounds of an Invested Art. The Honorblades on Roshar, indeed, may be the\nvery first example of this—from thousands of years ago. I believe this has\nrelevance to the discoveries being made on Scadrial, and the\ncommoditization of Allomancy and Feruchemy.\nSTONESHAPING\nAs I’ve had further occasion to study the use of Investiture on Roshar, and\nthe curious manifestation of it known as Surgebinding, I’ve found occasion\nto ruminate further on the nature of Intent and Connection.\nThe power known as Stoneshaping, as practiced by the orders of\nStonewards and Willshapers, is an excellent example of this. This ability\nmanipulates the Surge of Cohesion, and is in many ways a cousin to the\naxial manipulation known as microkinesis—as both grant the ability to\nmanipulate the forces that bind individual axi together. Fortunately, in my\nexplorations, it appears that Stoneshaping is far less … explosive of a\npower, bounded by the rules that Honor placed upon it to protect from the\nmistakes that happened on Yolen.\nNevertheless, a practiced Stoneward or Willshaper can mold stone as if it\nwere clay, weakening the bonds between axi. (Indeed, this can be done to\nother materials as well, I’m led to believe, but stone is the easiest and most\ncommon application.) This is not simply a chemical process. Normally, one\nmight expect heat to be involved to excite the axi, but this is not the case.\nIndeed, it is the Intent of the user that is relevant here.\nThe stone senses the desire of the Stoneward, and the practitioner is able\nto shape it through desire as much as through physical force. I don’t believe\nI properly understood the way Investiture responds to the conscious Intent\nof the user until I read of the interactions of spren and sapient beings on\nRoshar. There is so much to learn here and so much to explore.\nI have sent my best agent to embed among the Stonewards. His research\nhas been most illuminating. It suggests there are three ways we can look at\nthe nature of Intent as it relates to Stoneshaping.\nWillingness: Stone seems to be uniformly willing to obey the commands of\na Surgebinder attuned to Cohesion. This is curious, as stone is often among\nthe most difficult of materials to work with in Soulcasting—even more\ndifficult than living beings, depending on those beings’ emotional, mental,\nand spiritual states.\nWhy is stone so eager to change for a Stoneward or Willshaper? What\nabout it makes it so likely to respond to their desires, to incorporate them,"

What\nabout it makes it so likely to respond to their desires, to incorporate them,\nand to enjoy the result? Like a willing audience at a comedy, the stone lets\nthe Surgebinder guide it.\nConnection: The stone can sense the Intent of the Surgebinder, and even\ntheir past. I have reliable reports of stone reaching back through generations\nof Connection to display events, feelings, emotions, and ideas from long\nago. It will shape the faces of Stonewards long dead. It will create pictures\nof events long forgotten. What I initially dismissed as an inferior form of\nmicrokinesis is, indeed, much more focused and—in some ways—more\nremarkable. There is a divining property to Stoneshaping I had not thought\nto find.\nCommand: The Stoneshaper must often make a Command, mental or\nverbal, to truly control the stone. This is much like many other arcana\naround the cosmere, and is in itself not that novel. However, I find\nelectrifying the news out of the mountains of Ur, that their current queen\nseems to have been able to Command the creation of an anti-Investiture.\nLong theorized, this will be my first true evidence it is possible—and can\nonly be created through Intent.\nI think that perhaps Foil, deep within his ocean, would find this\ninformation supports my theories over his. And he’d do well to listen to me\non this matter if he ever wishes to achieve control over the aethers, as he\nhas insisted is his goal.\nBOOKS BY\nBRANDON SANDERSON®\n®\nTHE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE\nThe Way of Kings\nWords of Radiance\nOathbringer\nRhythm of War\nTHE\nMISTBORN®\nSAGA\nTHE ORIGINAL TRILOGY\nMistborn\nThe Well of Ascension\nThe Hero of Ages\nTHE WAX AND WAYNE SERIES\nThe Alloy of Law\nShadows of Self\nThe Bands of Mourning\nElantris\nWarbreaker\nArcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere® Collection\nLegion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds\nALCATRAZ VS.
