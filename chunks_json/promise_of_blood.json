Even when you should\nhave been.\nChapter 1\nAdamat wore his coat tight, top buttons fastened against a wet night air that\nseemed to want to drown him. He tugged at his sleeves, trying to coax more\nlength, and picked at the front of the jacket where it was too close by far\naround the waist. It’d been half a decade since he’d even seen this jacket,\nbut when summons came from the king at this hour, there was no time to\nget his good one from the tailor. Yet this summer coat provided no defense\nagainst the chill snaking through the carriage window.\nThe morning was not far off but dawn would have a hard time scattering\nthe fog. Adamat could feel it. It was humid even for early spring in\nAdopest, and chillier than Novi’s frozen toes. The soothsayers in Noman’s\nAlley said it was a bad omen. Yet who listened to soothsayers these days?\nAdamat reasoned it would give him a cold and wondered why he had been\nsummoned out on a pit-made night like this.\nThe carriage approached the front gate of Skyline and moved on\nwithout a stop. Adamat clutched at his pantlegs and peered out the window.\nThe guards were not at their posts. Odder still, as they continued along the\nwide path amid the fountains, there were no lights. Skyline had so many\nlanterns, it could be seen all the way from the city even on the cloudiest\nnight. Tonight the gardens were dark."

    "text": "wide path amid the fountains, there were no lights. Skyline had so many\nlanterns, it could be seen all the way from the city even on the cloudiest\nnight. Tonight the gardens were dark.\nAdamat was fine with this. Manhouch used enough of their taxes for his\npersonal amusement. Adamat stared out into the gardens at the black maws\nwhere the hedge mazes began and imagined shapes flitting back and forth\nin the lawn. What was… ah, just a sculpture. Adamat sat back, took a deep\nbreath. He could hear his heart beating, thumping, frightened, his stomach\ntightening. Perhaps they should light the garden lanterns…\nA little part of him, the part that had once been a police inspector,\nprowling nights such as these for the thieves and pickpockets in dark alleys,\nlaughed out from inside. Still your heart, old man, he said to himself. You\nwere once the eyes staring back from the darkness.\nThe carriage jerked to a stop. Adamat waited for the coachman to open\nthe door. He might have waited all night. The driver rapped on the roof.\n“You’re here,” a gruff voice said.\nRude.\nAdamat stepped from the coach, just having time to snatch his hat and\ncane before the driver flicked the reins and was off, clattering into the night.\nAdamat uttered a quiet curse after the man and turned around, looking up at\nSkyline.\nThe nobility called Skyline Palace “the Jewel of Adro.” It rested on a\nhigh hill east of Adopest so that the sun rose above it every morning. One\nparticularly bold newspaper had compared it to a starving pauper wearing a\ndiamond ring. It was an apt comparison in these lean times. A king’s pride\ndoesn’t fill the people’s bellies.\nHe was at the main entrance. By day, it was a grand avenue of marbled\nwalks and fountains, all leading to a pair of giant, silver-plated doors,\nthemselves dwarfed by the sheer façade of the biggest single building in\nAdro. Adamat listened for the soft footfalls of patrolling Hielmen. It was\nsaid the king’s personal guard were everywhere in these gardens, watching\nevery secluded corner, muskets always loaded, bayonets fixed, their gray-\nand-white sashes somber among the green-and-gold splendor. But there\nwere no footfalls, nor were the fountains running. He’d heard once that the\nfountains only stopped for the death of the king. Surely he’d not have been\nsummoned here if Manhouch were dead. He smoothed the front of his\njacket. Here, next to the building, a few of the lanterns were lit.\nA figure emerged from the darkness. Adamat tightened his grip on his\ncane, ready to draw the hidden sword inside at a moment’s notice.\nIt was a man in uniform, but little could be discerned in such ill light.\nHe held a rifle or a musket, trained loosely on Adamat, and wore a flat-\ntopped forage cap with a stiff visor. Only one thing could be certain… he\nwas not a Hielman. Their tall, plumed hats were easy to recognize, and they\nnever went without them.\n“You’re alone?” a voice asked."

    "text": "was not a Hielman. Their tall, plumed hats were easy to recognize, and they\nnever went without them.\n“You’re alone?” a voice asked.\n“Yes,” Adamat said. He held up both hands and turned around.\n“All right. Come on.”\nThe soldier edged forward and yanked on one of the mighty silver\ndoors. It rolled outward slowly, ponderously, despite the man putting his\nweight into it. Adamat moved closer and examined the soldier’s jacket. It\nwas dark blue with silver braiding. Adran military. In theory, the military\nreported to the king. In practice, one man held their leash: Field Marshal\nTamas.\n“Step back, friend,” the soldier said. There was a note of impatience in\nhis voice, some unseen stress—but that could have been the weight of the\ndoor. Adamat did as he was told, only coming forward again to slip through\nthe entrance when the soldier gestured.\n“Go ahead,” the soldier directed. “Take a right at the diadem and head\nthrough the Diamond Hall. Keep walking until you find yourself in the\nAnswering Room.” The door inched shut behind him and closed with a\nmuffled thump.\nAdamat was alone in the palace vestibule. Adran military, he mused.\nWhy would a soldier be here, on the grounds, without any sign of the\nHielmen? The most frightening answer sprang to mind first. A power\nstruggle. Had the military been called in to deal with a rebellion? There\nwere a number of powerful factions within Adro: the Wings of Adom\nmercenaries, the royal cabal, the Mountainwatch, and the great noble\nfamilies. Any one of them could have been giving Manhouch trouble. None\nof it made sense, though. If there had been a power struggle, the palace\ngrounds would be a battlefield, or destroyed outright by the royal cabal.\nAdamat passed the diadem—a giant facsimile of the Adran crown—and\nnoted it was in as bad taste as rumor had it. He entered the Diamond Hall,\nwhere the walls and floor were of scarlet, accented in gold leaf, and\nthousands of tiny gems, which gave the room its name, glittered from the\nceiling in the light of a single lit candelabra. The tiny flames of the\ncandelabra flickered as if in the wind, and the room was cold.\nAdamat’s sense of unease deepened as he neared the far end of the\ngallery. Not a sign of life, and the only sound came from his own echoing\nfootfalls on the marble floor. A window had been shattered, explaining the\nchill. The result of one of the king’s famous temper tantrums? Or something\nelse? He could hear his heart beating in his ears. There. Behind a curtain, a\npair of boots? Adamat passed his hand before his eyes. A trick of the light.\nHe stepped over to reassure himself and pulled back the curtain.\nA body lay in the shadows. Adamat bent over it, touched the skin. It\nwas warm, but the man was most certainly dead. He wore gray pants with a\nwhite stripe down the side and a matching jacket. A tall hat with a white\nplume lay on the floor some ways away. A Hielman. The shadows played\non a young, clean-shaven face, peaceful except for a single hole in the side"

    "text": "plume lay on the floor some ways away. A Hielman. The shadows played\non a young, clean-shaven face, peaceful except for a single hole in the side\nof his skull and the dark, wet stain on the floor.\nHe’d been right. A struggle of some kind. Had the Hielmen rebelled,\nand the military been brought in to deal with them? Again, it didn’t make\nany sense. The Hielmen were fanatically loyal to the king, and any matters\nwithin Skyline Palace would have been dealt with by the royal cabal.\nAdamat cursed silently. Every question compounded itself. He\nsuspected he’d find some answers soon enough.\nAdamat left the body behind the curtain. He lifted his cane and twisted,\nbared a few inches of steel, and approached a tall doorway flanked by two\nhooded, scepter-wielding sculptures. He paused between the ancient statues\nand took a deep breath, letting his eyes wander over a set of arcane script\nscrawled into the portal. He entered.\nThe Answering Room made the Hall of Diamonds look small. A pair of\nstaircases, one to either side of him and each as wide across as three\ncoaches, led to a high gallery that ran the length of the room on both sides.\nFew outside the king and his cabal of Privileged sorcerers ever entered this\nroom.\nIn the center of the room was a single chair, on a dais a handbreadth off\nthe floor, facing a collection of knee pillows, where the cabal acknowledged\ntheir liege. The room was well lit, though from no discernible source of\nlight.\nA man sat on the stairs to Adamat’s right. He was older than Adamat,\njust into his sixtieth year with silver hair and a neatly trimmed mustache\nthat still retained a hint of black. He had a strong but not overly large jaw\nand his cheekbones were well defined. His skin was darkened by the sun,\nand there were deep lines at the corners of his mouth and eyes. He wore a\ndark-blue soldier’s uniform with a silver representation of a powder keg\npinned above the heart and nine gold service stripes sewn on the right\nbreast, one for every five years in the Adran military. His uniform lacked an\nofficer’s epaulettes, but the weary experience in the man’s brown eyes left\nno question that he’d led armies on the battlefield. There was a single pistol,\nhammer cocked, on the stair next to him. He leaned on a sheathed small\nsword and watched as a stream of blood slowly trickled down each step, a\ndark line on the yellow-and-white marble.\n“Field Marshal Tamas,” Adamat said. He sheathed his cane sword and\ntwisted until it clicked shut.\nThe man looked up. “I don’t believe we’ve ever met.”\n“We have,” Adamat said. “Fourteen years ago. A charity ball thrown by\nLord Aumen.”\n“I have a terrible time with faces,” the field marshal said. “I apologize.”\nAdamat couldn’t take his eyes off the rivulet of blood. “Sir. I was\nsummoned here. I wasn’t told by whom, or for what reason.”\n“Yes,” Tamas said. “I summoned you. On the recommendation of one\nof my Marked. Cenka. He said you served together on the police force in\nthe twelfth district.”"

    "text": "“Yes,” Tamas said. “I summoned you. On the recommendation of one\nof my Marked. Cenka. He said you served together on the police force in\nthe twelfth district.”\nAdamat pictured Cenka in his mind. He was a short man with an unruly\nbeard and a penchant for wines and fine food. He’d seen him last seven\nyears ago. “I didn’t know he was a powder mage.”\n“We try to find anyone with an affinity for it as soon as possible,”\nTamas said, “but Cenka was a late bloomer. In any case”—he waved a hand\n—“we’ve come upon a problem.”\nAdamat blinked. “You… want my help?”\nThe field marshal raised an eyebrow. “Is that such an unusual request?\nYou were once a fine police investigator, a good servant of Adro, and\nCenka tells me that you have a perfect memory.”\n“Still, sir.”\n“Eh?”\n“I’m still an investigator. Not with the police, sir, but I still take jobs.”\n“Excellent. Then it’s not so odd for me to seek your services?”\n“Well, no,” Adamat said, “but sir, this is Skyline Palace. There’s a dead\nHielman in the Diamond Hall and…” He pointed at the stream of blood on\nthe stairs. “Where’s the king?”\nTamas tilted his head to the side. “He’s locked himself in the chapel.”\n“You’ve staged a coup,” Adamat said. He caught a glimpse of\nmovement with the corner of his eye, saw a soldier appear at the top of the\nstairs. The man was a Deliv, a dark-skinned northerner. He wore the same\nuniform as Tamas, with eight golden stripes on the right breast. The left\nbreast of his uniform displayed a silver powder keg, the sign of a Marked.\nAnother powder mage.\n“We have a lot of bodies to move,” the Deliv said.\nTamas gave his subordinate a glance. “I know, Sabon.”\n“Who’s this?” Sabon asked.\n“The inspector that Cenka requested.”\n“I don’t like him being here,” Sabon said. “It could compromise\neverything.”\n“Cenka trusted him.”\n“You’ve staged a coup,” Adamat said again with certainty.\n“I’ll help with the bodies in a moment,” Tamas said. “I’m old, I need\nsome rest now and then.” The Deliv gave a sharp nod and disappeared.\n“Sir!” Adamat said. “What have you done?” He tightened his grip on\nhis cane sword.\nTamas pursed his lips. “Some say the Adran royal cabal had the most\npowerful Privileged sorcerers in all the Nine Nations, second only to Kez,”\nhe said quietly. “Yet I’ve just slaughtered every one of them. Do you think\nI’d have trouble with an old inspector and his cane sword?”\nAdamat loosened his grip. He felt ill. “I suppose not.”\n“Cenka led me to believe that you were pragmatic. If that is the case, I\nwould like to employ your services. If not, I’ll kill you now and look for a\nsolution elsewhere.”\n“You’ve staged a coup,” Adamat said again.\nTamas sighed. “Must we keep coming back to that? Is it so shocking?"

    "text": "solution elsewhere.”\n“You’ve staged a coup,” Adamat said again.\nTamas sighed. “Must we keep coming back to that? Is it so shocking?\nTell me, can you think of any fewer than a dozen factions within Adro with\nreason to dethrone the king?”\n“I didn’t think any of them had the skill,” Adamat said. “Or the daring.”\nHis eyes returned to the blood on the stairs, before his mind traveled to his\nwife and children, asleep in their beds. He looked at the field marshal. His\nhair was tousled; there were drops of blood on his jacket—a lot, now that he\nthought to look. Tamas might as well have been sprayed with it. There were\ndark circles under his eyes and a weariness that spoke of more than just age.\n“I will not agree to a job blindly,” Adamat said. “Tell me what you\nwant.”\n“We killed them in their sleep,” Tamas said without preamble. “There’s\nno easy way to kill a Privileged, but that’s the best. A mistake was made\nand we had a fight on our hands.” Tamas looked pained for a moment, and\nAdamat suspected that the fight had not gone as well as Tamas would have\nliked. “We prevailed. Yet upon the lips of the dying was one phrase.”\nAdamat waited.\n“ ‘You can’t break Kresimir’s Promise,’” Tamas said. “That’s what the\ndying sorcerers said to me. Does it mean anything to you?”\nAdamat smoothed the front of his coat and sought to recall old\nmemories. “No. ‘Kresimir’s Promise’… ‘Break’… ‘Broken’… Wait —\n‘Kresimir’s Broken Promise.’” He looked up. “It was the name of a street\ngang. Twenty… twenty-two years ago. Cenka couldn’t remember that?”\nTamas continued. “Cenka thought it sounded familiar. He was certain\nyou’d remember it.”\n“I don’t forget things,” Adamat said. “Kresimir’s Broken Promise was a\nstreet gang with forty-three members. They were all young, some of them\nno more than children, the oldest not yet twenty. We were trying to round\nup some of the leaders to put a stop to a string of thefts. They were an odd\nlot—they broke into churches and robbed priests.”\n“What happened to them?”\nAdamat couldn’t help but look at the blood on the stairs. “One day they\ndisappeared, every one of them—including our informants. We found the\nwhole lot a few days later, forty-three bodies jammed into a drain culvert\nlike pickled pigs’ feet. They’d been massacred by powerful sorceries, with\nexcessive brutality. The marks of the king’s royal cabal. The investigation\nended there.” Adamat suppressed a shiver. He’d not once seen a thing like\nthat, not before or since. He’d witnessed executions and riots and murder\nscenes that filled him with less dread.\nThe Deliv soldier appeared again at the top of the stairs. “We need\nyou,” he said to Tamas.\n“Find out why these mages would utter those words with their final\nbreath,” Tamas said. “It may be connected to your street gang. Maybe not.\nEither way, find me an answer. I don’t like the riddles of the dead.” He got"

    "text": "breath,” Tamas said. “It may be connected to your street gang. Maybe not.\nEither way, find me an answer. I don’t like the riddles of the dead.” He got\nto his feet quickly, moving like a man twenty years younger, and jogged up\nthe stairs after the Deliv. His boot splashed in the blood, leaving behind red\nprints. “Also,” he called over his shoulder, “keep silent about what you\nhave seen here until the execution. It will begin at noon.”\n“But…” Adamat said. “Where do I start? Can I speak with Cenka?”\nTamas paused near the top of the stairs and turned. “If you can speak\nwith the dead, you’re welcome to.”\nAdamat ground his teeth. “How did they say the words?” he said. “Was\nit a command, or a statement, or…?”\nTamas frowned. “An entreaty. As if the blood draining from their\nbodies was not their primary concern. I must go now.”\n“One more thing,” Adamat said.\nTamas looked to be near the end of his patience.\n“If I’m to help you, tell me why all of this?” He gestured to the blood on\nthe stairs.\n“I have things that require my attention,” Tamas warned.\nAdamat felt his jaw tighten. “Did you do this for power?”\n“I did this for me,” Tamas said. “And I did this for Adro. So that\nManhouch wouldn’t sign us all into slavery to the Kez with the Accords. I\ndid it because those grumbling students of philosophy at the university only\nplay at rebellion. The age of kings is dead, Adamat, and I have killed it.”\nAdamat examined Tamas’s face. The Accords was a treaty to be signed\nwith the king of Kez that would absolve all Adran debt but impose strict tax\nand regulation on Adro, making it little more than a Kez vassal. The field\nmarshal had been outspoken about the Accords. But then, that was\nexpected. The Kez had executed Tamas’s late wife.\n“It is,” Adamat said.\n“Then get me some bloody answers.” The field marshal whirled and\ndisappeared into the hallway above.\nAdamat remembered the bodies of that street gang as they were being\npulled from the drain in the wet and mud, remembered the horror etched\nupon their dead faces. The answers may very well be bloody.\nChapter 2\nLajos is dying,” Sabon said.\nTamas entered the apartments of the Privileged who’d been Zakary the\nBeadle. He swept through the salon and entered the bedchamber—a room\nbigger than most merchants’ houses. The walls were indigo and covered\nwith colorful paintings that displayed various Beadles in the history of\nAdro’s royal cabal. Doors led off to auxiliary rooms, such as the privy and\nBeadle’s kitchens. The door to the Beadle’s private brothel had been ripped\napart, splinters no bigger than a finger scattered across the room.\nThe Beadle’s bed had been stripped of sheets, the Beadle’s body tossed\naside for a wounded powder mage.\n“How do you feel?” Tamas said.\nLajos managed a weak cough.

    "text": "aside for a wounded powder mage.\n“How do you feel?” Tamas said.\nLajos managed a weak cough. Marked were tougher than most, and with\nthe gunpowder Lajos had ingested, now coursing through his blood, he would\nfeel little pain. It was little consolation as Tamas gazed on his friend. Half of\nLajos’s right arm was gone—lengthwise—and a hole the size of a melon had\nbeen torn through his abdomen. It was a miracle he’d lived this long. They’d\ngiven him half a horn’s worth of powder. That alone should have killed him.\n“I’ve felt better,” Lajos said. He coughed again, blood leaking from the\ncorner of his mouth.\nTamas drew his handkerchief and dabbed the blood away. “It won’t be\nmuch longer,” he said.\n“I know,” Lajos said.\nTamas squeezed his friend’s hand.\nLajos mouthed the words, “Thank you.”\nTamas took a deep breath. It was suddenly hard to see. He blinked his\neyes clear. Lajos’s breathing came to a rasping stop. Tamas made to pull his\nhand away when Lajos gripped it suddenly. Lajos’s eyes opened.\n“It’s all right, my friend,” Lajos said. “You’ve done what needed to be\ndone. Have peace.” His eyes focused elsewhere and then stilled. He was\ndead.\nTamas closed his friend’s eyes with the tips of his fingers and turned to\nSabon. The Deliv stood on the other side of the room, examining what was\nleft of the door to the harem where it hung on the frame by one hinge.\nTamas joined him and looked inside. The women had been corralled away\nan hour ago by his soldiers, taken to some other part of the palace with the\nrest of the Privilegeds’ whores.\n“The fury of a woman,” Sabon murmured.\n“Indeed,” Tamas said.\n“There’s no way we could have planned for this.”\n“Tell that to them,” Tamas said. He jerked his head at the row of four\nbodies on the floor, and the fifth that would soon be joining them. Five\npowder mages. Five friends. All because of one Privileged that had been\nunaccounted for. Tamas had just put a bullet in the Beadle’s head—a man\nwho he’d shaken hands with and spoken to on a regular basis. Tamas’s\nMarked stood around him, ready in case the old man had some fight in him.\nThey were not ready for the other Privileged, the one hiding in the brothel.\nShe’d sliced through that door like a guillotine blade through a melon,\nPrivileged’s gloves on her hands, fingers dancing as her sorcery tore\nTamas’s powder mages to shreds.\nA powder mage could float a bullet over a mile and hit the bull’s eye\n‑\nevery time. He could angle a bullet around corners with the power of his\nmind, and ingest black powder to make himself stronger and faster than\nother men. But he could do little to contest Privileged sorcery at close\nrange.\nTamas, Sabon, and Lajos had been the only men with time to react, and\nthey’d barely fought her off.

She’d fled, echoes of sorcerous destruction\nfollowing her through the palace as she went—probably nothing more than\na show to keep them from following. Her parting shot had been Lajos’s\nmortal wound, but it had been randomly flung. It very well could have been\nSabon, or even Tamas himself, who’d died there on the bed a moment ago.\nThe thought chilled Tamas’s blood.\nTamas looked away from the door. “We’ll have to follow her. Find her\nand kill her. She’s dangerous on the loose.”\n“A job for the magebreaker?” Sabon said. “I wondered why you’ve kept\nhim around.”\n“A contingency I didn’t want to use,” Tamas said. “I wish I had a mage\nto send with him.”\n“His partner is a Privileged,” Sabon said. “A magebreaker and a\nPrivileged should be more than a match for a single cabal Privileged.” He\ngestured at the wrecked door.\n“I don’t like to fight fair when it comes to the royal cabal,” Tamas said.\n“And remember, there’s a difference between a member of the royal cabal\nand a hired thug.”\n“Who was she?” Sabon asked. There was a note in his voice, perhaps\nreproach.\n“I have no idea,” Tamas snapped. “I knew every one of the king’s cabal.\nI’ve met them, dined with them. She was a stranger.”\nSabon took Tamas’s anger without comment. “A spy for another cabal?”\n“Not likely. The brothel girls are all checked. She didn’t look like a\nwhore. She was strong, weathered. The Beadle’s lover, maybe. I’ve never\nseen her before in my life.”\n“Could the Beadle have been training someone in secret?”\n“Apprentices are never secret,” Tamas said. “Privileged are too\nsuspicious to allow that.”\n“Their suspicions are often well founded,” Sabon said. “There has to be\na reason for her presence.”\n“I know. We’ll deal with her in good time.”\n“If the others had been here…” Sabon said.\n“More of us would be dead,” Tamas said. He counted the bodies again,\nas if there might be fewer this time. Five. Out of seventeen of his mages.\n“We split into two groups for precisely this reason.” He turned away from\nthe bodies. “Any word from Taniel?”\n“He’s in the city,” Sabon said.\n“Perfect. I’ll send him with the magebreaker.”\n“Are you sure?” Sabon said. “He just got back from Fatrasta. He needs\ntime to rest, to see his fiancée…”\n“Is Vlora with him?”\nSabon shrugged.\n“Let’s hope she gets here soon. Our work is not yet done.” He raised a\nhand to forestall protests. “And Taniel can rest when the coup’s over.”\n“What must be done will be done,” Sabon said quietly.\nThey both fell silent, regarding their fallen comrades.

    "text": "“What must be done will be done,” Sabon said quietly.\nThey both fell silent, regarding their fallen comrades. Moments passed\nbefore Tamas saw a smile spread on Sabon’s wrinkled black face. The Deliv\nwas tired and haggard, but with a hint of restrained joy. “We succeeded.”\nTamas eyed the bodies of his friends—his soldiers—again. “Yes,” he\nsaid. “We did.” He forced himself to look away.\nA painting stood in the corner, a monstrosity with a gilded frame on a\nsilver tripod befitting a herald of the royal cabal. Tamas studied the painting\nbriefly. It showed Zakary in his prime as a strong young man with broad\nshoulders and a stern frown.\nA far cry from the old, bent body in the corner. The bullet had entered his\nbrain in such a way as to kill him instantly, yet his lifeless throat had gasped\nthe same words as the others: “You can’t break Kresimir’s Promise.”\nCenka was white as a mummer’s painted face after the first of the\nPrivileged cried out as they died. He’d demanded that Tamas summon\nAdamat here, to the heart of their crime. Tamas hoped that Cenka was\nwrong. He hoped that the investigator found nothing.\nTamas left the cabal’s wing of the palace, Sabon following close behind.\n“I’ll need a new bodyguard,” Tamas said as they walked. It pained him\nto speak of it, with Lajos’s body still cooling.\n“A Marked?” Sabon asked.\n“I can’t spare one. Not now.”\n“I’ve had my eye on a Knacked,” Sabon said. “A man named Olem.”\n“He’s a soldier?” Tamas asked. He thought he knew the name. He held\nhis hand just slightly below his eyes. “About this tall? Sandy hair?”\n“Yes.”\n“What’s his Knack?”\n“He doesn’t need sleep. Ever.”\n“That’s useful,” Tamas said.\n“Quite. He has a strong third eye as well, so he can watch for\nPrivileged. I’ll have him briefed and by your side for the execution.”\nA Knacked wouldn’t be as useful as a powder mage. Knacked were\nmore common, and their abilities were more like a talent than a sorcerous\npower. But if he could use his third eye to see sorcery, he would be of some\nbenefit.\nTamas approached the barred doors of the chapel. A pair of Tamas’s\nsoldiers emerged from the shadows by the wall, muskets at the ready.\nTamas nodded to them and gestured at the door.\nOne of the soldiers removed a long knife from his belt and slid it\nbetween the doors to the chapels. “He flipped the Diocel’s latch,” said the\nsoldier fiddling with the knife, “but he didn’t even bother to stack anything\nin front of the door. Not very enterprising, if you ask me.” He flipped up the\nlock and he and his companion pushed the doors open.\nThe chapel was large, as were all the rooms in the palace. Unlike the\nrest of the palace, however, it had been spared the seasonal remodeling\ncustomary of the king’s whims and remained close to what it must have\nlooked like two hundred years ago.

    "text": "rest of the palace, however, it had been spared the seasonal remodeling\ncustomary of the king’s whims and remained close to what it must have\nlooked like two hundred years ago. The ceiling was vaulted impossibly\nhigh, with boxes for the royalty and high nobles set about halfway up the\nwalls in between columns as wide across as an oxcart. The floor was tiled in\nmarble designed in intricate mosaics of various shapes and sizes, while the\nceiling contained paneled depictions of the saints as they founded the Nine\nNations under the god Kresimir’s fatherly gaze.\nTwo altars sat at the front of the chapel, raised slightly above the\nbenches, next to a pulpit of blackwood. The first altar, smaller, closer to the\npeople, was dedicated to Adro’s founding saint, Adom. The second, larger\naltar, sided by marble and covered with satin, was dedicated to Kresimir.\nBeside this altar huddled Manhouch XII, sovereign of Adro, and his wife\nNatalija, Duchess of Tarony. Natalija stared behind and above the altar, her\nlips moving in silent prayer to Kresimir’s Rope. Manhouch was pale, his\neyes red, lips drawn to a thin line. He spoke in a desperate whisper to the\nDiocel. He stopped as Tamas approached.\n“Wait,” the Diocel called, one hand rising as the king jogged down the\nsteps from the altar and stormed toward Tamas with purpose. The Diocel’s\nold face was fraught, his robes wrinkled from a hasty rush to the chapel.\nTamas watched Manhouch march toward him. He noted the one hand\nheld behind his back, the fury of emotions playing across Manhouch’s\naristocratic young face. Manhouch looked barely seventeen thanks to the\nhigh sorceries of his royal cabal, though in reality he was well into his\nthirties. It was supposed to reflect the monarchy’s agelessness, but Tamas\nhad always found it hard to take such a young-looking man seriously.\nTamas stopped and regarded the king, watched him falter before coming\ncloser.\nFive paces away, Manhouch revealed his pistol. It came up swiftly. His\naim was sure at that range—after all, Tamas himself had taught the king to\nshoot. It was an unfortunate reflection on his detachment from the world,\nhowever, that Manhouch attempted it at all. He pulled the trigger.\nTamas reached out mentally and absorbed the power of the powder\nblast. He felt the energy course through him, warming his body like a sip of\nfine spirits. He redirected the power of the blast harmlessly into the floor,\ncracking a marble tile beneath the king. Manhouch danced away from the\ncracked tile. The ball rolled from the barrel of his pistol and clattered to the\nground, stopping by Tamas’s feet.\nTamas stepped forward, taking the pistol from the king by the barrel. He\nbarely felt it burn his hand.\n“How dare you,” Manhouch said. His face was powdered, his cheeks\nblushed. His silk bedclothes were rumpled, soaked with sweat. “We trusted\nyou to protect us.” He trembled slightly.\nTamas looked past Manhouch to the Diocel still beside the altar.

    "text": "you to protect us.” He trembled slightly.\nTamas looked past Manhouch to the Diocel still beside the altar. The\nold priest leaned against the wall, his tall, embroidered hat of office\nbalanced precariously on his head. “I suppose,” Tamas said, shaking the\npistol, “he got this from you?”\n“It wasn’t meant for that,” the Diocel wheezed. He stuck his chin up. “It\nwas meant for the king. So he can take his life honorably and not be struck\ndown by a godless traitor.”\nTamas sent forth his senses, looking for more powder charges, but there\nwere none. “You only brought one pistol, with one bullet,” Tamas said. “It\nwould have been kinder to bring two.” He glanced at the queen, still\ndirecting her prayers toward Kresimir’s Rope.\n“You wouldn’t…” the Diocel said.\n“He won’t!” Manhouch spoke over him. “He won’t kill us. He can’t.\nWe are God’s chosen.” He took a deep, shaky breath.\nTamas felt a ripple of pity for the king. He knew Manhouch was older\nthan he looked, but in reality he was nothing more than a child. It wasn’t all\nhis fault. Greedy councillors, idiot tutors, indulgent sorcerers. There were\nany number of reasons he’d been a bad—no, terrible—king. He was,\nhowever, king. Tamas squashed the pity. Manhouch would face the\nconsequences.\n“Manhouch the Twelfth,” Tamas said, “you are under arrest for the\nutmost neglect of your people. You will be tried for treason, fraud, and\nmurder through starvation.”\n“A trial?” Manhouch whispered.\n“Your trial is now,” Tamas said. “I am your judge and jury. You have\nbeen found guilty before the people and before Kresimir.”\n“Don’t pretend to speak in God’s name!” the Diocel said. “Manhouch is\nour king! Sanctioned by Kresimir!”\nTamas laughed mirthlessly. “You’re quick enough to invoke Kresimir\nwhen it suits you. Is he on your mind when you’ve got a concubine\nwrapped in your silk sheets or when you eat a meal of delicacies that would\nhave fed fifty peasants? Your place is not at the right hand of God, Diocel.\nThe Church has sanctioned this coup.”\nThe Diocel’s eyes grew large. “I would have known.”\n“Do the arch-diocels tell you everything? I thought not.”\nManhouch gathered his strength and matched Tamas’s gaze. “You have\nno evidence! No witnesses! This is not a trial.”\nTamas flung his hand out to the side. “My evidence is out there! The\npeople are unemployed and starving. Your nobles whore and hunt and fill\ntheir plates with meat and their glasses with wine while the common man\nstarves in the gutter. Witnesses? You plan on signing the entire country\nover to the Kez next week with the Accords. You would make us all vassals\nto a foreign power simply to dissolve your debt.”\n“Baseless claims, spoken by a traitor,” Manhouch whispered weakly.\nTamas shook his head. “You will be executed at noon along with your"

    "text": "to a foreign power simply to dissolve your debt.”\n“Baseless claims, spoken by a traitor,” Manhouch whispered weakly.\nTamas shook his head. “You will be executed at noon along with your\ncouncillors, your queen, and many hundreds of your relatives.”\n“My cabal will destroy you!”\n“They’ve already been executed.”\nThe king paled further and began to shake violently, collapsing to the\nfloor. The Diocel slowly made his way forward. Tamas looked down on\nManhouch for a moment and pushed aside the unbidden image of a young\nprince, perhaps six or seven, bouncing on his knee.\nThe Diocel reached Manhouch’s side and knelt. He looked up at Tamas.\n“Is this because of your wife?”\nYes. Tamas said aloud, “No. It’s because Manhouch has proved that the\nlives of an entire nation shouldn’t be subject to the whims of a single inbred\nfool.”\n“You would dethrone a God-sanctioned ruler and become a tyrant, and\nstill claim to love Adro?” the Diocel said.\nTamas glanced at Manhouch. “God no longer sanctions this. If you\nweren’t so blinded by your gold-lined robes and young concubines, you’d\nsee it is so. Manhouch deserves the pit for his neglect of Adro.”\n“You’ll surely see him there,” the Diocel said.\n“I don’t doubt it, Diocel. I’m sure the company will be anything but\ndull.” Tamas dropped the empty pistol at Manhouch’s feet. “You have until\nnoon to make your peace with God.”\nChapter 3\nTaniel paused on the top step of the House of Nobles. The building was\ndark and silent as a graveyard this hour of the morning. There were soldiers\nstationed at intervals on the steps, at the street, and at every door. He\nrecognized Field Marshal Tamas’s men in their dark-blue jackets. Many of\nthem knew him by sight. Those who didn’t saw the silver powder keg\npinned to his buckskin jacket. One of them raised a hand in greeting. Taniel\nreturned the gesture and then produced a snuffbox and sprinkled a line of\nblack powder on the back of his hand. He snorted it.\nThe powder made him feel vibrant, animated. It sharpened his senses\nand his mind. It made his heart beat faster and soothed frayed nerves. For a\nMarked, powder was life.\nTaniel felt a tap on his shoulder and turned. His companion stood a full\nhead shorter than he, and her body was as slight as a youth’s. She wore a\nfull-length travel duster that filled her out only a little and kept her warm,\nand a wide-brimmed hat that concealed most of her features. An early\nspring chill filled the air, and Ka poel came from a much warmer place than\n‑\nthis.\nShe pointed up at the building above them quizzically, revealing a\nsmall, freckled hand. Taniel had to remind himself that she’d never seen a\nbuilding like the House of Nobles. Six stories high and as wide as a\nbattlefield, the center of the Adran government was big enough to house the\noffices of every noble and their staff.\n“We’re here.” Taniel’s voice seemed unusually stark in the quiet of the"

    "text": "battlefield, the center of the Adran government was big enough to house the\noffices of every noble and their staff.\n“We’re here.” Taniel’s voice seemed unusually stark in the quiet of the\nearly hour. “This is where his soldiers said to go. He doesn’t have an office\nhere. Did it happen tonight? I could have picked a better time…” He trailed\noff.\nHe was prattling on to a mute, betraying his nervousness. Tamas would\nbe livid when he heard about Vlora. Of course, it would be Taniel’s fault.\nTaniel noticed he still held the snuffbox. His hands were trembling. He\ntapped out another dark line on the back of his thumb. He snorted the\npowder and tilted his head back as his heart pumped faster. Lines in the\ndarkness grew sharper, sounds louder, and he sighed at the comfort the\npowder trance gave him. He held up a hand to the light of the streetlamp. It\nno longer shook.\n“Pole,” he said, addressing the girl. “I haven’t seen Tamas in some time.\nHe’s a hard man to all but a close few. Sabon. Lajos. Those are his friends.\nI am just another soldier.” Green eyes regarded him from beneath the wide-\nbrimmed hat. “Understand?” he said.\nKa poel nodded briefly.\n‑\n“Here,” Taniel said. He reached into the front of his jacket and removed\nhis sketchbook. It was a worn book, ragged from use and travels, bound in\nfaded calfskin. He flipped through the pages until he found a likeness of\nField Marshal Tamas and handed it to Ka poel. The sketch was in charcoal\n‑\nand smudged from wear, but the field marshal’s severe face was hard to\nmistake. Ka poel studied the drawing for a moment before handing the\n‑\nbook back.\nTaniel pushed open one of the giant doors and headed into the grand\nhall. The place was pitch-black but for one pool of light near a staircase to\nTaniel’s left. A single lantern hung on the wall, and beneath it dozed a\nweary form in a servant’s chair.\n“I see Tamas has moved up in the world.”\nTaniel listened to his own voice echo in the grand hall and was satisfied\nto see Sabon jump from his chair. Lines stood out on Sabon’s dark face,\ndetails Taniel could only see because of the powder trance. Sabon looked to\nhave aged ten years in the mere two it had been since they’d last met.\n“I don’t like it,” Taniel added, swinging his rifle and knapsack from his\nshoulder and onto the plush red carpet. He bent to rub feeling into his legs\nafter twenty hours in a coach. “Too cold in the winter, too lonely in the\nsummer. And space like this just invites houseguests.”\nSabon chuckled as he came over. He clasped Taniel’s hand and pulled\nhim into an embrace. “How is Fatrasta?”\n“Officially? Still at war with the Kez,” Taniel said. “Unofficially, the\nKez have sued for peace and all but a few regiments have returned to the\nNine. Fatrasta has won their independence.”\n“You kill a Kez Privileged or two for me?” Sabon said."

Fatrasta has won their independence.”\n“You kill a Kez Privileged or two for me?” Sabon said.\nTaniel lifted his rifle to the light. Sabon ran his finger along the row of\nnotches in the stock and whistled appreciatively. “Even a few Wardens,”\nTaniel said.\n“Those are hard to kill,” Sabon said.\nTaniel nodded. “Took more than one bullet for the Wardens.”\n“Taniel Two-Shot,” Sabon said. “You’ve been the talk of the Nine for a\nyear. The royal cabal has been scared stiff. Wanted Manhouch to recall you.\nMarked killing Privileged, even Kez Privileged, is a bad precedent.”\n“Too late, I assume?” Taniel said, glancing around the dark grand hall.\nElse he wouldn’t be here. If all went as planned, Tamas had slaughtered the\nroyal cabal and captured Manhouch.\n“It was done a few hours ago,” Sabon said.\nTaniel thought he saw a hardness to the old soldier’s eyes. “Things\ndidn’t go well?”\n“We lost five men.” Sabon rattled off a list of names.\n“May they rest with Kresimir.” Even as he said it, the prayer sounded\nhollow in Taniel’s ears. He winced. “And Tamas?”\nSabon sighed. “He is… tired. Toppling Manhouch is only the first step.\nWe still have the execution, a new government to establish, the Kez to deal\nwith, starvation, the poor. The list goes on.”\n“Does he foresee problems with the people?”\n“Tamas foresees just about everything. There will be royalists. It would\nbe stupid to think there won’t, in a city of a million people. We just don’t\nknow how many or how organized they’ll be. Tamas needs you; you and\nVlora both. She didn’t come with you?” Taniel glanced toward Ka poel.\n‑\nShe was the only other person in the hall. She’d left Taniel’s gear in a pile\non the floor and was making a slow round of the place, gazing up at\npaintings that could barely be seen in the dim light. Her rucksack was slung\nover one shoulder.\nTaniel felt his jaw clench. “No.”\nSabon drifted a step back and jerked his head toward Ka poel.\n‑\n“My servant,” Taniel said. “A Dynize.”\n“A savage, eh?” Sabon mused. “Did the Dynize Empire finally open\ntheir borders? That’s big news.”\n“No,” Taniel said. “Some of the Dynize tribes live in western Fatrasta.”\n“Doesn’t look more than a boy.”\n“Careful who you call a boy,” Taniel said. “She can be a bit prickly\nabout that.”\n“A girl, then,” Sabon said, giving Taniel a wry glance. “Can she be\ntrusted?”\n“I’ve saved her life more times than she has mine,” Taniel said.\n“Savages take that sort of thing very seriously.”\n“Not so savage,” Sabon murmured. “Tamas will want to know why\nVlora’s not here.”"

    "text": "“Savages take that sort of thing very seriously.”\n“Not so savage,” Sabon murmured. “Tamas will want to know why\nVlora’s not here.”\n“Let me handle that.” Tamas would ask about Vlora before he even\nasked about Fatrasta. Taniel knew he’d be a fool to imagine two years\nwould have changed much. Two years. Pit. Had it been that long? Two\nyears ago Taniel had gone abroad for what would have been a short tour of\nthe Kez colony of Fatrasta. Time to “cool his head,” Tamas had said. Taniel\narrived a week before they declared their independence from Kez and he’d\nbeen forced to pick sides.\nSabon gave a curt nod. “I’ll take you to him, then.”\nSabon lifted the lantern from its hook while Taniel gathered his things.\nKa poel drifted a few steps behind them as they traveled the dark corridors.\n‑\nThe House of Nobles was eerie and huge. Thick carpet muffled their\nfootsteps, so they trod almost like ghosts. Taniel didn’t like the silence. It\nreminded him too much of the forest when there were enemies on the\nprowl. They rounded a corner, and there was light coming from a room at\nthe end of the hallway. Voices, too, and they were raised in anger.\nTaniel paused in the doorway of a well-lit sitting room—the\nantechamber of some noble’s office. Inside, two men faced each other\nbefore an overlarge fireplace. They stood not a foot apart, fists clenched, on\nthe edge of blows. A third man, a bodyguard, with more presence than most\nand the battered features of a boxer, stood off to the side, looking\nperplexed, wondering if he should step in.\n“You knew!” the smaller man was saying. His face was red, and he\nstood on his toes to try to match the other’s height. He pushed a pair of\nspectacles up his nose, only to have them slide down again. “Tell me true,\nhave you planned this all along? Did you know you’d move up the\nschedule?”\nTaniel watched Field Marshal Tamas raise his hands before him, palms\noutward. “Of course I didn’t know,” he said. “I’m going to explain it all in\nthe morning.”\n“At the execution! What kind of a coup…” The little man noticed\nTaniel and trailed off. “Get out,” he said. “This is a private conversation.”\nTaniel removed his hat and leaned against the doorframe, fanning\nhimself casually. “But it was just getting interesting,” he said.\n“Who is this boy?” the little man demanded of Tamas.\nBoy? Taniel glanced at the field marshal. Tamas couldn’t have expected\nhim this very night, but he didn’t show a bit of surprise. Tamas wasn’t one\nto betray his emotions. Taniel sometimes wondered if Tamas had any\nemotions.\nTamas let out a sigh. “Taniel, it’s good to see you.”\nWas it? Tamas looked anything but happy. His hair had thinned in the\nlast two years, and his mustache had more gray than black now. Tamas was\ngetting old. Taniel nodded slowly to the field marshal.\n“Forgive me,” Tamas said after a brief pause. “Taniel, this is Ondraus"

Ondraus, this is Marked Taniel, one of my mages.”\n“This is no place for a boy.” Ondraus caught sight of Ka poel hovering\n‑\nbehind Taniel. He squinted. “… And a savage,” he finished. He squinted\nagain, as if unsure of what he saw the first time. He muttered something\nunder his breath.\nTamas introduced Taniel as a powder mage. Was that all he was to the\nfield marshal? Just another soldier?\nTamas opened his mouth, but Taniel spoke first.\n“Sir,” he said. “I’m a captain in the Fatrastan army, a Marked in service\nto Adro, and I know all about the coup. I can kill a pair of Privileged at over\na mile with one shot and have done so on several occasions. I’m hardly a\nboy.”\nOndraus sniffed. “Ah, yes, Tamas. So this is your famous son.”\nTaniel played at his teeth with his tongue and watched his father. So I\nam, aren’t I? It’s good of you to remind him, Ondraus. He tends to forget.\n“Taniel has a right to be here,” Tamas said.\nOndraus examined Taniel for a moment. His anger was slowly replaced\nby a look of calculation. He took a deep breath. “I want promises,” he said\nto Tamas. The emotion had gone from his voice. It was all business, and\nthere was a note of danger there far more frightening than his former fury.\n“The others will be as angry as I, but if you let me get my hands on the\nroyal ledgers before the execution, I’ll give you my support.”\n“How kind,” Tamas said dryly. “You’re the king’s reeve. You already\nhave the royal ledgers.”\n“No,” Ondraus said as if explaining something to a child. “I’m the city\nreeve. I want Manhouch’s private accounting. He’s been spending like an\nexpensive whore at the jeweler’s for ten years, and I intend to balance the\nbooks.”\n“We agreed to open his coffers to the poor.”\n“After I balance the books.”\nTamas considered this for a moment. “Done. You have until the\nexecution. At noon.”\n“Right.” Ondraus crossed the room, leaning heavily on a cane. He\ngestured the big man to follow him. They both pushed past Taniel and\nmoved down the dark hall, their footsteps echoing on marble.\n“Without so much as a ‘by your leave,’” Taniel said.\n“The world is nothing more than figures and arithmetic to Ondraus,”\nTamas said with a dismissive gesture. He motioned Taniel into the room\nand stepped forward. They shook hands. Taniel searched his father’s eyes,\nwondered if he should pull him into a hug like he might with comrades long\nabsent. Tamas was frowning at the wall, his mind on something else, and\nTaniel let the thought go.\n“Where is Vlora?” Tamas asked, looking curiously at Ka poel. “Didn’t\n‑"

He tried to keep his tone\nneutral. First thing Tamas asked. Of course.\n“Sit down,” Tamas said. “There is so much to talk about. Let’s begin\nwith this. Who is she?”\nKa poel had set Taniel’s knapsack and rifle in the corner and was\n‑\nexamining the room and the curtains with some interest. Her time in the\ncities of the Nine had been hurried, as she and Taniel had taken coach after\ncoach, sleeping as they traveled, to arrive in Adopest.\n“Her name is Ka poel,” Taniel said. “She’s a Dynize, from a tribe in\n‑\nwestern Fatrasta. Pole,” Taniel instructed, “remove your hat.” He gave his\nfather an apologetic smile. “I’m still teaching her Adran manners. Their\nways are very different from ours.”\n“The Dynize Empire has opened their borders?” Tamas seemed\nskeptical.\n“A number of natives in the Fatrastan Wilds share blood with the\nDynize, but the strait between Dynize and Fatrasta keeps them from\nsuffering their cousins’ isolationism.”\n“Does Dynize concern the Fatrastan generals?”\n“Concern? The mere thought gives them heartburn. But the Dynize civil\nwar has shown no signs of stopping. They won’t turn their eyes outward for\nsome time.”\n“And the Kez?” Tamas asked.\n“When I left, they were already making overtures of peace.”\n“That’s a pity. I’d hoped Fatrasta would keep them occupied for some\ntime yet.” Tamas gave Taniel a look up and down. “I see you’re still\nwearing frontier clothing.”\n“And what’s wrong with that? I spent all my money on passage home.”\nTaniel tugged on the front of his buckskin jacket. “These are the best\nclothes on the frontier. Warm, durable. I forgot how bloody cold Adro can\nbe. I’m glad I have them.”\n“I see.” Tamas stepped over to Ka poel and gave her a look-over. She\n‑\nheld her hat in both hands and boldly returned Tamas’s gaze. Her hair was\nfire red, and her light skin was covered in ashen freckles—an oddity unseen\nin the Nine. Her features were small, petite. Not at all the image of a big,\nsavage warrior that most of the Nine had of the Dynize.\n“Fascinating,” Tamas said. “How did you come across her?”\n“She was the scout for our regiment,” Taniel said. “Helped us track Kez\nPrivileged through the Fatrastan Wilds. She became my spotter, and I saved\nher life a few times. She hasn’t left my side since.”\n“She speaks Adran?”\n“She’s a mute. She understands it, though.”\nTamas leaned forward, looking into Ka poel’s eyes. He examined her\n‑\ncheeks and ears as well, as one might a prize horse. Taniel wondered if\nTamas would check the teeth next. Ka poel would bite him for that. Taniel\n‑\nalmost hoped he did."

Taniel\n‑\nalmost hoped he did.\nTaniel said, “She’s a sorcerer, a Bone-eye. The Dynize version of a\nPrivileged, though their magic is somewhat different, from what I gather.”\n“Savage sorcerers,” Tamas said. “I’ve heard something about them.\nShe’s very small. How old is she?”\n“Fourteen years,” Taniel said. “I think. They’re a small-statured people,\nbut demons on the battlefield. Not bad with a rifle either. Ah,” he said as he\nsuddenly remembered. “I wanted to show you something.”\nHe pointed to his rifle. Ka poel undid the knot holding his satchel to it\n‑\nand brought it to him. Taniel grinned and held the rifle out to his father.\n“Is this…? Is this the rifle you used for that shot?” Tamas asked.\n“Sure is.”\nTamas took the rifle by the barrel, flipped it up, and sighted. “Awfully\nlong. Good weight. Rifled bore and a covered pan on the flintlock.\nBeautiful craftsmanship.”\n“Take a look at the name under the barrel.”\n“A Hrusch. Very nice.”\n“Not just the design,” Taniel said. “Made by the man himself. I spent a\nmonth with him in Fatrasta. He’d been working on it for quite some time,\nmade it a gift to me.”\nTamas’s eyes widened. “Genuine? I’ve not seen better-made rifles. We\nbought rights to the patent a year ago and have been churning them out for\nthe army, but I’ve only seen one made by the man himself.”\nTaniel felt warmth at his father’s wonder. Finally something new.\nSomething Tamas might be proud of. “The Kez tried to buy the patent too,”\nTaniel said.\n“Really? Even though they were at war with Fatrasta?”\n“Of course. The Hrusch rifle kicked their asses on the frontier. Hardly a\nmisfire, even in the worst of weather. Hrusch wouldn’t sell it to them, not\nfor a chest of gold and an earldom. And Kez gunsmiths can’t replicate his\nwork.”\n“No one can, not unless they’ve been trained by the man himself.”\nTamas examined the rifle closely for several minutes before handing it\nback.\n“You like it?” Taniel said.\n“Remarkable.” His interest seemed to wane suddenly, his attention\nbecoming distant.\nTaniel hesitated. “Then you’ll like this.” He held out a hand to Ka poel.\n‑\nShe brought him a wooden case, a little longer than a man’s forearm and\nmade of polished mahogany.\n“A gift,” Taniel said.\nTamas set the case on a table and flipped open the top. “Incredible,” he\nbreathed.\n“Saw-handled dueling pistols,” Taniel said. “Made by Hrusch’s oldest\nson—who they say is a better gunsmith than his father. Refined flintlock\nwith a rainproof pan and a roller bearing on the steel spring. A smoothbore,"

    "text": "son—who they say is a better gunsmith than his father. Refined flintlock\nwith a rainproof pan and a roller bearing on the steel spring. A smoothbore,\nbut more accurate than most.” Taniel felt the warmth return as his father’s\nface lit up.\nTamas lifted one of the matched pair of pistols and ran his fingers up\nand down the octagonal barrel. Ivory inlay caught the lamplight, the polish\non it shining beautifully. “These are incredible. I’ll have to provoke an\ninsult, just so I can use them.”\nTaniel chuckled. That sounded like something Tamas would do.\n“These are… wonderful,” Tamas said.\nTaniel thought he saw something glisten in his father’s eyes. Was he\nproud? Grateful? No, he decided, Tamas doesn’t know the meaning of those\nwords.\n“I wish we had more time to talk,” Tamas said.\n“On to business?” Of course. No time for chatting. No time to catch up\nwith a long-absent son.\n“Unfortunately,” Tamas said, either missing or ignoring the sarcasm.\n“Sabon,” he called. The Deliv appeared in the doorway. “Bring in the\nmercenaries.” Sabon disappeared again. “Now, where is Vlora? We need\nyou both. Did Sabon tell you about our losses?”\n“Sabon told me. Sad news. I imagine Vlora will be along eventually,”\nhe said with a shrug. “I didn’t exactly talk to her.”\nTamas scowled. “I thought—”\n“I found her in another man’s bed,” Taniel said, feeling a jolt of\nsatisfaction at the shock on Tamas’s face. The shock turned to anger, then\ngrief.\n“Why? When? For how long?” The words tumbled from Tamas, a\nmoment of true confusion that Taniel wondered if any had ever seen in\nTamas, or would again.\nTaniel leaned on his rifle and fought back a sneer. Why should Tamas\ncare? It wasn’t his fiancée. “For several months, from the gossip. The man\nwas paid to seduce her. Some nobleman’s son, in it for the thrill and the\nmoney.”\n“Paid?” Tamas asked, his eyes narrowing.\n“A scheme,” Taniel said. “Petty revenge. No doubt hatched by a\nwealthy nobleman.” Taniel hadn’t taken the time to find out who the culprit\nwas, but he had little uncertainty. The nobility hated Tamas. He was\ncommon-born and had used his influence with the king to prevent the\nwealthy from purchasing commissions in the army. Only the capable rose in\nthe ranks. It flew in the face of tradition, but also made the Adran army one\nof the best in the Nine. The nobility feared Tamas too much to attack him\ndirectly, but they’d strike him any way they could, even through his son.\nTamas’s teeth clenched in a snarl. “I’ve arrested half the nobility this\nvery night. They face the guillotine with their king. I’ll find out who paid,\nand then…”\nTaniel suddenly felt tired. Years fighting a war that wasn’t his, followed\nby months of cramped traveling, only to come home to betrayal and a coup.\nHis anger had been sapped. He thumbed a line of black powder onto his"

    "text": "by months of cramped traveling, only to come home to betrayal and a coup.\nHis anger had been sapped. He thumbed a line of black powder onto his\nhand and snorted it. “The guillotine is enough. Save your men.” Save your\nanger, though Kresimir knows you have enough of it. No pity, though. None\nfor your son, the betrayed.\nTamas rubbed his eyes. “I should have had her watched.”\n“She’s free to do what she wants,” Taniel said. It came out as a snarl.\n“The wedding?”\n“I nailed her ring to the bastard bedding her. They’ll have had to cut\nhim off his own sword.”\nSabon reentered the room. He was followed by a pair of disreputable-\nlooking characters wearing the clothes of people who slept in the saddle, or\non a barroom bench. One was a man, tall and lanky with a hairline that\ntouched the back of his head, though he couldn’t have been older than\nthirty. He wore a belt that covered his entire stomach, carried four swords\nand three pistols of different sizes and shapes, and he wore the gloves of a\nPrivileged—though instead of white with colored runes, the gloves were\nnavy blue with gold runes. The man was a magebreaker: a Privileged who’d\ngiven up his natural-born sorcery to nullify magic at will.\nThe other was a woman. She looked to be in her late thirties and wore\nriding pants and a jacket. She would have been beautiful but for the old scar\nthat lifted the corner of her lip and traveled all the way to her temple. She,\ntoo, wore the gloves of a Privileged, which allowed her to touch the Else.\nHers were white with blood-red runes. Taniel wondered why she wasn’t in\na cabal. He could sense she was strong enough even without opening his\nthird eye.\nMercenaries, Tamas had said. These two had a look. A Privileged and a\nmagebreaker together were a dangerous combination. They were used to\nhunt Knacked, Marked, and Privileged. Taniel wondered which his father\nhad in mind.\n“A Privileged escaped our cull at Skyline,” Tamas said. “Not one of the\nroyal cabal, but powerful nonetheless. I want you three”—a glance at\nKa poel—“four to track her down and kill her.”\n‑\nTamas settled into the role of a man used to briefing his soldiers, and\nTaniel realized his homecoming amounted to little more than a briefing and\nan assignment. Off hunting another Privileged. He glanced at the two\nmercenaries. They had a competent look to them. Taniel had had less to\nwork with in Fatrasta. This Privileged they meant to hunt had killed five\nseasoned powder mages in half a breath. She’d be dangerous, and Taniel\nhad never hunted in a city before. He decided the challenge would keep his\nmind off… things.\nTaniel lifted his snuffbox once more and tapped out a line on the back\nof his hand, ignoring his father’s disapproving look.\nNila paused for a moment to watch the fire burn beneath the big iron pot\nsuspended in the fireplace.

    "text": "Nila paused for a moment to watch the fire burn beneath the big iron pot\nsuspended in the fireplace. She rubbed her chapped hands together and\nwarmed them over the flames. The water would boil soon, and she’d finish\nwashing the laundry for everyone in the townhouse. There was a small pile\nof dirty laundry stacked by the pantry, but most of the family’s clothes, as\nwell as the servants’ livery, had been soaking in the large vats of warm\nwater and lye soap since last evening. They would need to be boiled, rinsed,\nand then hung out to dry, but first she needed to iron the duke’s dress\nuniform. He had a meeting with the king at ten. That was still hours away,\nbut all of it, the washing, rinsing, and ironing, had to be done before the\ncooks got up to make breakfast.\nThe door to the washroom opened and a boy of five came into the\nkitchen rubbing the sleep from his eyes.\n“Can’t sleep, young master?” Nila asked.\n“No,” he said. The only child of Duke Eldaminse, Jakob was very\nsickly. He had blond hair and a pale face with narrow cheeks. He was small\nfor his age, but bright, and friendlier to the help than a duke’s son ought to\nbe. Nila had been thirteen and an apprentice laundress for the Eldaminse\nwhen he was born. From the time he could walk he’d taken a liking to her,\nmuch to the chagrin of his mother and governess.\n“Have a seat here,” Nila said, rearranging a clean, dry blanket near the\nfire for Jakob. “Only for a couple of minutes, then you need to go back to\nbed before Ganny awakes.”\nHe settled onto the blanket and watched her heat the irons on the stove\nand lay out his father’s clothes. His eyes soon began to droop and he settled\nonto his side.\nNila dragged a large washbasin over beside the iron pot. She was just\nabout to pour in the water when the door opened again.\n“Nila!” Ganny stood in the doorway, hands on her hips. She was\ntwenty-six, and severe beyond her age; well suited to be the governess of a\nducal heir. She wore her cocoa-colored hair up in a tight bun behind her\nhead. Even in her nightclothes, Ganny seemed more proper than Nila with\nher plain dress and unruly auburn curls.\nNila put a finger to her lips.\n“You know he’s not supposed to be in here,” Ganny said, lowering her\nvoice.\n“What should I do? Say no?”\n“Of course!”\n“Leave him be, he’s finally asleep.”\n“He’ll catch a cold down here.”\n“He’s right next to the fire,” Nila said.\n“If the duchess finds him here, she’ll be furious!” Ganny shook her\nfinger at Nila. “I won’t stick up for you when she turns you out on the\nstreet.”\n“And when have you ever stuck up for me?”\nGanny’s lips took on a hard line. “I’ll recommend your dismissal to the\nduchess tonight. You’re nothing but a bad influence on Jakob.”\n“I will…” Nila took one look at the sleeping boy and closed her mouth."

    "text": "duchess tonight. You’re nothing but a bad influence on Jakob.”\n“I will…” Nila took one look at the sleeping boy and closed her mouth.\nShe had no family, no connections. The duchess already disliked her. Duke\nEldaminse had a habit of bedding the help, and he’d been looking at her\nmore often lately. Nila didn’t need any trouble with Ganny, even if she was\na bully. “I’m sorry, Ganny,” Nila said. “I’ll get him back to bed now. Do\nyou have any clothes I can get the stains out of for you?”\n“That’s a better attitude,” Ganny said. “Now…”\nShe was interrupted by a hammering on the front door, loud enough to\nbe heard all the way at the back of the townhouse.\n“Who is that at this early hour?” Ganny pulled her nightclothes tightly\naround her and headed into the hallway. “They’ll wake up the lord and\nlady!”\nNila put her hands on her hips and looked at Jakob. “You’ll get me in\ntrouble, young master.”\nHis eyes fluttered open. “Sorry,” he said.\nShe knelt down beside him. “It’s all right, go back to sleep. Let me\ncarry you to bed.”\nShe’d just lifted him up when she heard the scream from the front of the\nhouse. Shouts followed and then the hammering footsteps running up the\nstairs in the main hallway. She heard angry male voices that didn’t belong\nto any of the house staff.\n“What is that?” Jakob asked.\nShe set him on his feet so that he couldn’t feel her hands shaking.\n“Quickly,” she said. “In the washtub.”\nJakob’s bottom lip trembled. “Why, what’s happening?”\n“Hide!”\nHe climbed into the washtub. She dumped the dirty laundry on top of\nhim and stacked it high and then hurried into the hallway.\nShe ran right into a soldier. The man shoved her back into the kitchen.\nHe was soon joined by two other men, then another holding Ganny by the\nback of the neck. He shoved Ganny to the floor. The governess’s eyes were\nfull of fear mingled with indignation.\n“These two will do,” one of the soldiers said. He wore the dark blue of\nthe Adran army, with two golden service stripes on his chest and a silver\nmedal that indicated he’d served the crown overseas. He began to loosen his\nbelt and stepped toward Nila.\nNila grabbed the hot iron from the stove and hit him hard across the\nface. He went down, to the shouts of his comrades.\nSomeone grabbed her arms, another her legs.\n“Feisty,” one said.\n“That will leave a mark,” said another.\n“What is the meaning of this!” Ganny had finally gotten to her feet. “Do\nyou know whose house this is?”\n“Shut up.” The soldier Nila had hit climbed to his feet, a swollen burn\ncovering half of his face. He punched Ganny hard in the stomach. “We’ll\nget to you soon enough.” He turned to Nila.\nNila struggled against hands too strong for her. She turned to the\nwashbasin, hoping Jakob would not see this, and closed her eyes to wait for\nthe blow.\n“Heathlo!” a voice barked."

She turned to the\nwashbasin, hoping Jakob would not see this, and closed her eyes to wait for\nthe blow.\n“Heathlo!” a voice barked.\nShe opened her eyes again when the hands that held her suddenly let up.\n“What the pit you doing, soldier?” The man who spoke wore the same\nuniform as the others, only set apart by a gold triangle pinned to his silver\nlapel. He had sandy hair and a neatly trimmed beard. A cigarette hung out\nof the corner of his mouth. Nila had never seen a soldier with a beard\nbefore.\n“Just having some fun, Sergeant.” Heathlo gave Nila a menacing glare\nand turned toward the sergeant.\n“Fun? No fun for us, soldier. This is the army. You heard the field\nmarshal’s orders.”\n“But, Sergeant…”\nThe sergeant leaned over and picked up the iron from where it lay on\nthe floor. He looked at the bottom, then at the burn on the soldier’s face.\n“You want me to give you a matching one on the other side?”\nHeathlo’s eyes hardened. “This bitch struck me.”\n“I’ll hit you somewhere prettier than your face next time I see you try to\nrape an Adran citizen.” The sergeant pointed his cigarette at Heathlo. “This\nisn’t Gurla.”\n“I’ll report this to the captain, sir,” Heathlo sneered.\nThe sergeant shrugged.\n“Heathlo,” one of the other soldiers said. “Don’t push him. Sorry,\nSergeant, he’s new to the company and all.”\n“Keep him in line,” the sergeant said. “He’s new, but I expect better\nfrom you two.” He helped Ganny to her feet, then touched his finger to his\nforehead toward Nila. “Ma’am. We’re looking for Duke Eldaminse’s son.”\nGanny looked at Nila. Nila could tell she was terrified. “He was with\nyou,” the governess said.\nNila forced herself to look into the sergeant’s blue eyes. “I just carried\nhim up to bed.”\n“Go on,” the sergeant said to his soldiers. “Find him.” They left the\nroom quickly. He remained and gave a slow look around the kitchen. “He’s\nnot in his bed.”\n“He has a habit of wandering,” Nila said. “I just put him to bed, but I’m\nsure he was scared by the noise. What is happening?” This was no accident.\nThose soldiers knew exactly whose house this was. The sergeant had\nmentioned a field marshal. Adro only had one man of that rank: Field\nMarshal Tamas.\n“Duke Eldaminse and his family are under arrest for treason,” the\nsergeant said.\nGanny blanched and looked as if she might faint.\nNila felt her stomach tighten. Treason. Accusations like that would see\nthe whole staff put to the question. There was no escape. She’d heard a\nstory once of an archduke, the Iron King’s own cousin, who plotted against\nthe throne. His family and every member of his staff had been sent to the\nguillotine.\n“You’re free to go,” the sergeant said. “We’re only here for the duke\nand his family.” He stepped toward the washbasin, frowning. “You’ll want"

In fact, if you can, you should leave the city for at\nleast a few days.” He put the cigarette between his lips and lifted a pair of\ntrousers from the top of the washbasin.\n“Olem!”\nThe sergeant turned his head as another soldier entered the room.\n“They find the boy?” Olem said, the washbasin forgotten.\n“No, but a summons came for you. From the field marshal.”\n“For me?” Olem sounded doubtful.\n“Report to Commander Sabon immediately.”\n“All right,” Olem said. He crushed his cigarette out on the kitchen table.\n“Keep an eye on Heathlo. Don’t let him rough up any of the women. If you\nhave to give the boys an armful of loot to keep ’em occupied, do it.”\n“But our orders—”\n“The boys will break some of our orders one way or another. I’d rather\nthey break the ones that won’t see them hanged.”\n“Right.”\nOlem took one last look around the kitchen. “Get any valuables you\nhave here and leave,” he said. “The duke won’t be coming back for\nanything, either…” He touched his forehead toward Ganny and Nila before\nleaving.\nSo take what you want. Nila finished the sentence in her head.\nGanny gave Nila one quick look before she ran into the hallway. Nila\ncould hear her feet on the servants’ stairs a moment later.\nNila fished the butler’s key from its hiding place above the mantel and\nunlocked the silverware cabinet. Nothing she had hidden under her mattress\nupstairs was worth a fraction of the silver she now piled into a burlap bag.\nShe waited until she couldn’t hear any of the soldiers in the hallway and\npulled Jakob from the washbasin. She helped him pull his nightclothes over\nhis head and handed him a pair of dirty trousers and a shirt from one of the\nserving boys. They’d be too big, but they’d do.\n“What are we doing?” he asked.\n“Taking you someplace safe.”\n“What about Miss Ganny?”\n“I think she’s gone for good,” Nila said.\n“Mother and father?”\n“I don’t know,” Nila said. “They’ll want you to come with me, I think.”\nShe took a handful of cool ashes from the corner of the fireplace and mixed\nthem in her palm with water. “Hold still,” she said, smearing the ashes in\nhis hair and on his face. She took his hand, and with a sack full of pilfered\nsilver over her shoulder, Nila headed out the back entrance.\nTwo soldiers watched the alley behind the townhouse. Nila walked\ntoward them, head down.\n“You there,” one of the men said. “Whose child is this?”\n“Mine,” Nila said.\nThe soldier lifted Jakob’s chin. “Doesn’t look like a duke’s son.”\n“Should we hold him till we find the boy?” the other said.\n“Sergeant Olem said we could go,” Nila said.\n“Fine,” the soldier said. “Off with you, then. We’ve a busy night.”"

    "text": "“Sergeant Olem said we could go,” Nila said.\n“Fine,” the soldier said. “Off with you, then. We’ve a busy night.”\nChapter 4\nAdamat took a carriage straight home from Skyline, driven by one of\nTamas’s soldiers. It was a long journey, accompanied only by his worries\nand self-doubts as the driver navigated the quiet night streets of Adro.\nAdamat silently wished they could go faster. It didn’t help. The eastern sky\nhad begun to lighten when he leapt from the carriage and pushed through\nthe old gate and past his small garden to his front door. He fumbled with his\nkeys, dropping them once, before he stopped to take a deep breath.\nHe’d seen worse than this, he told himself. It would be no worse than\nthe riots in Oktersehn. He jammed the key in the lock and twisted, the\nrusted metal squeaking as he half pushed, half kicked the door open.\nHe took the stairs two at a time to the second floor and thumped each\ndoor as he ran down the hallway. He reached his own room and threw open\nthe door.\n“Faye,” he said.\nHis wife lifted her head from the pillow and regarded him by the light\nof a low-burning lamp. The shadows moved across her face, darkened by a\nhalo of black, curly hair. “What hour is it?” she asked.\n“Sometime after five o’clock,” Adamat said. He turned the lamp up and\nthrew the covers back. “Get up. You’re going to the house in Offendale.”\nFaye clutched the covers to her chest. “What’s gotten into you? What\nhouse in Offendale?”\n“The one we bought when I first entered the force. In case there was\never danger to you and the children.”\nFaye sat up. “I thought we sold that house. I… Adamat. What has\nhappened?” A note of worry entered her voice. “Is this about the Lourent\nfamily? Or a new case?”\nThe Lourent family had hired him to look into the checkered past of\ntheir youngest daughter’s suitor. The whole affair had ended badly when he\nwas forced to expose the man as a fraud.\n“No, not the Lourent case. Bigger than that.” Adamat turned at soft\nfootfalls in the hall. “Astrit,” he said softly. His youngest daughter held a\nfrayed, stuffed dog under one arm. She wore her nightgown and an old pair\nof Faye’s slippers that were several sizes too big, and in the dim light she\nlooked like a miniature version of her mother. She tilted her head\nquizzically. Adamat said, “Go get your travel coat, darling. You’re going on\na trip.”\n“Do I have to wear a dress?” she asked.\nAdamat forced a smile. “No, love, just a travel coat over your\nnightgown. You’re leaving very soon. Don’t forget your shoes.”\nShe smiled at him and turned, skipping down the hallway, the old\nstuffed dog dangling from one hand. Her older siblings gave her odd looks\nas they began to emerge from their rooms.\n“Josep,” Adamat said to his oldest son. “Get your brothers and sisters\nready to go. Quickly. Get them all to pack a bag for a few weeks.”"

    "text": "as they began to emerge from their rooms.\n“Josep,” Adamat said to his oldest son. “Get your brothers and sisters\nready to go. Quickly. Get them all to pack a bag for a few weeks.”\nThe boy was a serious youth, just past his sixteenth year and on holiday\nfrom school. He rubbed nervously at the ring on his finger; it had been a\ngift from Adamat’s father before the old man passed, and the boy was\nseldom without it. Josep waited a moment for an explanation. When none\nwas forthcoming, he nodded before herding his siblings back to their rooms.\nGood lad. Adamat turned back to Faye, who was now sitting up in bed.\nShe ran a hand through her hair, pulling at tangles.\n“You’d better have a good explanation,” she said. “What has happened?\nIs there danger to the children? To you? Is this about some new job you’ve\ntaken? I told you to stop snooping after noblemen’s wives and going on\nabout other people’s business.”\nAdamat closed his eyes. “I’m an investigator, my dear. Other people’s\nbusiness is my business. There will be riots. I want you and the children out\nof the city within the hour. Just a precaution, of course.”\n“Why will there be riots?”\nDamned woman. What he’d give for an obedient wife. “There has been\na coup. Manhouch will face the guillotine at noon.”\nHe had the brief satisfaction of watching her jaw drop. Then she was on\nher feet, headed toward the closet. Adamat watched her for a moment. Her\nbody was more angular than it had once been; sharp elbows and wrinkled\nskin in place of soft curves and a gentle, lovely plumpness. The years since\nhis retirement from the force had taken their toll on her, and she was not as\nbeautiful as in her youth. Adamat pictured himself. He was no one to judge.\nShort, balding, his round face grown leaner over the years, his mustache\nand beard thinner. He wasn’t exactly as young as he used to be. Still… he\nbit his lower lip as he watched Faye, entertaining actions that would need to\nwait some time.\nShe turned, saw him watching her. “You’re coming with us, aren’t\nyou?” she said.\n“No.”\nShe paused. “Why not?”\nHe should lie. Tell her he had previous commitments. “I’ve become…\ninvolved.”\n“Oh no. Adamat, what the pit did you do?”\nHe stifled a smile. He loved it when she swore. “Not like that. No.\nTonight’s summons. Field Marshal Tamas has a task for me.”\nShe scowled. “Only he’d have the rocks to pull down a king. Well, stop\ngrinning and summon a carriage and help the children with their shoes.”\nShe made a brushing motion with her hand. “Go on!”\nTwenty minutes later, Adamat watched as his family piled into a pair of\ncarriages. He paid the drivers and stood for a moment with his wife. “If the\nriots seem to be moving toward you, don’t hesitate to take the children to\nDeliv. I’ll come find you when things have settled down.”\nFaye’s face—usually harsh, firmly disapproving—was suddenly soft."

    "text": "Deliv. I’ll come find you when things have settled down.”\nFaye’s face—usually harsh, firmly disapproving—was suddenly soft.\nShe was young again in his eyes, a worried girl waiting for her lover to\nwalk the midnight roads. She leaned forward and kissed him tenderly on the\nlips. “What should I tell the children?”\n“Don’t lie to them,” Adamat said. “They’re old enough.”\n“They’ll worry. Especially Astrit.”\n“Of course,” Adamat said.\nFaye sniffed. “I haven’t been to Offendale since we went on holiday\nafter Astrit was born. Is the house there in good order?”\n“It’ll be small,” Adamat said. “Cozy. But safe. Do you remember our\ncode phrases? The post office is in the next town. I’ll send a letter to Saddie\nasking her to bring you the mail.”\n“Is all that necessary?” Faye asked. “I thought it was just riots.”\n“Field Marshal Tamas is a dangerous man,” Adamat said. “I don’t…”\nHe paused. “Just as a precaution. Humor me.”\nFaye said, “Of course. Take care of yourself.” Adamat returned his\nwife’s kiss, then leaned in the window of each carriage in turn, giving every\none of the nine children a kiss, two for each of the twins. He stopped at\nAstrit and knelt down on the floor of the carriage to look her in the eye.\n“You’ll be away for a couple of weeks. The city is going to be a bit rough.”\n“Why aren’t you coming?” she asked.\n“I’ve got to help make it safer.” He thought of Kresimir’s Broken\nPromise. The words made him shiver.\n“Are you cold?” Astrit asked.\nHe brushed a finger across her cheek. “Yes,” he said. “It’s very chilly.\nI’d better go in before I catch cold. Have a safe trip!”\nHe closed the carriage door and stood in the street, watching them\ntrundle off until they turned a corner. He would miss Faye for many\nreasons. When it came to his investigations, she was more than a wife to\nhim. She was a partner. She had a vast network of friends and\nacquaintances and knew how to coerce gossip to find out information that\neven he could not turn up.\nHe headed back to the house, stopping for a moment only as he saw a\nmovement in a doorway across the street. A young man in a long, stiff coat\nemerged from the shadows and headed off in the opposite direction from\nthe carriages. He spared one glance for Adamat and doubled his step.\nAdamat watched the young man go, making sure the stranger felt his\ngaze. One of Palagyi’s goons, no doubt. Adamat would hear from him\nshortly. Adamat returned to the house, locking the door behind him, and\nwent immediately to the study. He dug through his desk drawers until he\nfound a stack of stationery.\nThe sun had finally touched his study window, looking in over the\nhouses and the distant mountains, when Adamat finished addressing letters.\nHis hand ached from writing, and his candle had burned to a nub. He\nyawned, letting his mind wander for a moment, when the faint scratching\nsound of metal on metal caught his ear."

    "text": "His hand ached from writing, and his candle had burned to a nub. He\nyawned, letting his mind wander for a moment, when the faint scratching\nsound of metal on metal caught his ear.\nAdamat pushed the whole stack of letters into a desk drawer and locked\nit. He picked up his cane and twisted until it clicked, then walked through\nthe house, listening for the sound. He reached a rear door, small and old,\nthat led to an overgrown trellis in what amounted to their garden between\ntheir house and the one behind it. The garden could be reached from the\nhouse itself or from a small corridor that ran between two houses, which\ncontained a locked gate.\nAdamat jerked the door open, cane in hand. Three men stared back at\nhim. Two of them wore the faded coats and simple brimmed hats of street\nworkers. The one’s knees and shirtsleeves were stained black—likely from\nshoveling coal into a furnace—and the second, the lockpick, wore clothes\nmuch too big for him, the common practice of a street thief who wanted to\nsecret a number of things about his person. The third man was richly\ndressed, a gray overcoat over a sharp black waistcoat, and had shoes shined\nwell enough that one could check one’s teeth in them.\nThe lockpick gaped up at Adamat from his knees.\n“You’re making enough noise, you might as well have knocked on the\nfront door,” Adamat said. He sighed and lowered his cane and spoke to the\nbest-dressed of the three. “What do you want, Palagyi?”\nPalagyi seemed surprised to see him here. He pushed at a pair of round\nspectacles that rested more on his chubby cheeks than on his thin nose. The\nman was an oddity, with a body that would seem more at home in a circus\nthan anywhere else. He had a round belly that hung far over his belt, but his\narms and legs were no thicker than a sapling. It made him look like an\noversized cannonball with sticks for arms.\nHe was a longtime street thug who had just enough ruthlessness to rise\nto legitimate businesses and not quite enough intelligence to leave his dark\nlife behind him. Aptly suited as a banker. Adamat cataloged his criminal\nrecord in his mind in an instant.\n“Word had it that you’d skipped town,” Palagyi said.\n“You mean the word of that inbred you’ve had skulking around my\nhouse for the last couple of weeks?”\n“I have a reason to keep my eye on you.” He seemed annoyed that\nAdamat was actually still there.\nAdamat gave a long-suffering sigh and watched Palagyi grind his teeth.\nPalagyi hated when he wasn’t taken seriously. He’d changed little since he\nwas just a half-drunk loan shark. “I’ve got two months until my debt is\ndue.”\n“There is absolutely no way you’re going to gather seventy thousand\nkrana in two months. So when I hear your family is skipping town in the\nmiddle of the night, I think perhaps you’ve decided to take the coward’s\nway and run for it.”\n“Careful who you call a coward,” Adamat said. He reversed his grip on\nhis cane.\nPalagyi flinched. “I took my last beating from you long ago,” he said,"

He reversed his grip on\nhis cane.\nPalagyi flinched. “I took my last beating from you long ago,” he said,\n“and you’re no longer protected by the police. You’re just one of us now,\nan ordinary gutter rat. You shouldn’t have taken out a loan with me.” He\nlaughed. It was a tinny sound that grated on Adamat’s nerves.\nIt was Adamat’s turn to grind his teeth. He’d not taken out a loan from\nPalagyi, but from a bank belonging to a friend. That friend proved a bad\none when he sold the loan to Palagyi for nearly one hundred and fifty\npercent of its worth. Palagyi had promptly tripled the interest and sat back\nand waited for Adamat’s new publishing business to fail. Which it had.\nPalagyi wiped a tear of mirth from his eye and snorted. “When I learn\nthat one of my biggest private loans has sent his family out of town just two\nmonths before his loan is due, I check on it personally.”\n“And try to break into his house?” Adamat said. “You can’t clean me\nout and throw us onto the street until after I’ve defaulted.”\n“Perhaps I got greedy.” Palagyi smiled thinly. “Now, I’m going to need\nto know where your family is so that I can check in on them.”\nAdamat spoke through clenched teeth. “They’re at my cousin’s. East of\nNafolk. Check all you want.”\n“Good. I will.” Palagyi turned to go, when he stopped suddenly.\n“What’s your girl’s name? The youngest one. I think I’ll have some of my\nboys bring her back, just in case you try to slip onto one of those new\nsteamers and make for Fatrasta.”\nPalagyi had just enough time to flinch before Adamat’s cane cracked\nover his shoulder. Palagyi cried out and stumbled into the garden. The coal\nshoveler punched Adamat in the belly.\nAdamat doubled over from pain. He’d not expected the man to hit so\nfast or so hard. He nearly dropped his cane, and it was all he could do to\nremain standing.\n“I’ll have the police on you!” Palagyi wailed.\n“Try it,” Adamat wheezed. “I still have friends there. They’ll laugh you\ninto the street.” He regained his composure and pulled himself up enough to\nslam the door. “Come back in two months!” He locked the door and slid the\ndeadbolt.\nAdamat held his stomach and staggered back to his office. He’d have\nindigestion from that blow for a week. He hoped he wasn’t bleeding.\nAdamat spent a few minutes recovering before he gathered his letters\nand set out into the streets. He could feel tension growing around him. He\nwanted to attribute it to the coming conflict that he knew would happen—\nthe revolution that would sweep the city when Manhouch was declared\ndead, and the chaos that would follow. Adamat prayed that Tamas would\nkeep it in check. A task that might very well prove impossible. But no, the\ntension was likely just Adamat’s growing headache and the pain in the pit\nof his stomach.\nNot far from the postmaster’s, Adamat stopped on a street corner to"

    "text": "tension was likely just Adamat’s growing headache and the pain in the pit\nof his stomach.\nNot far from the postmaster’s, Adamat stopped on a street corner to\ncatch his breath. His stride had been unconsciously hurried, his breathing\nhard, a worried sense of danger lurking in the back of his mind.\nA newsie lad, no more than ten, sprinted into view. He stopped on the\ncorner next to Adamat and took mighty gasps before throwing his head\nback and shouting:\n“Manhouch has fallen! The king has fallen! Manhouch faces the\nguillotine at noon!” Then the boy was gone, onto the next corner.\nAdamat snapped himself out of a stunned silence and turned to watch\nothers do the same. He knew that Manhouch had fallen. He’d seen the blood of\nthe royal cabal on Tamas’s jacket. Yet hearing it spoken aloud on a public\nstreet made his hands tremble. The king had fallen. Change had been forced\non the country, and the people would be forced to choose how they’d react.\nThe initial shock of the news passed. Confusion set in as pedestrians\nchanged their plans midstride. A carriage turned around abruptly in the\nstreet. The driver didn’t see the small girl selling flowers. Adamat rushed\nout, grabbed her by the arm, and pulled her away before the horses could\ntrample her. Her flowers spilled into the street. One man shoved another in\na sudden, hurried dash across the street and was in turn shoved to the\nground. A fistfight began, only to be quickly put down by a truncheon-\nwielding police officer.\nAdamat helped the girl pick up her flowers before she ran off. He\nsighed. It’s begun. He put his head down and pushed on toward the\npostmaster’s.\nChapter 5\nTamas stood on a balcony six floors above the enormous city square called\nthe King’s Garden, his face in the wind, watching the crowds gather. His\ntwo hounds slept at his feet, unaware of the importance of this day. He wore\nhis freshly pressed dress uniform; dark blue with gold epaulettes on each\nshoulder, and gold buttons—each of them a small powder keg. The lapel,\ncollar cuffs, and wings of his uniform were of red velvet, his belt of black\nleather. He wore his medals at the insistence of his aides: gold, silver, and\nviolet stars of various shapes and sizes awarded to him by half a dozen\nGurlish shahs and kings of the Nine. He held his bicorne hat under one arm.\nThe sun was just barely above the rooftops of Adopest, yet he guessed\nthere were already fifteen thousand people below watching as crews\nconstructed a line of guillotines. It was said the Garden could contain four\nhundred thousand, half the population of Adopest.\nThey would find out today.\nHis gaze fell across the Garden to the tower that rose like a thorn\nagainst the morning sky. Sabletooth had been built by Manhouch’s father,\nthe Iron King, as a prison for his most dangerous enemies, and as a warning\nto all the rest. It had taken almost half of his sixty-year reign to build and its\ncolor had given the Iron King his nickname. It was three times the height of\nany building in Adopest, an ugly thing, a nail of basalt that looked like it"

It was three times the height of\nany building in Adopest, an ugly thing, a nail of basalt that looked like it\nhad been ripped from the pages of a legend from before the Time of\nKresimir.\nAt the moment Sabletooth was full to capacity with nearly six hundred\nnobles and many of their wives and oldest sons, as well as another five\nhundred courtiers and royal dignitaries that couldn’t be trusted on their\nown. When Tamas closed his eyes, he thought he could hear wails of\nanguish, and he wondered if it was his imagination. The nobility knew what\nwas coming to them. They had for a century.\nTamas turned away from his view of the city when the door behind him\nclicked. A soldier stepped out onto the balcony. His solid blue uniform with\na silver collar matched Tamas’s, with a gold sergeant’s triangle pinned to\nthe lapel, and stripes of service above his breast to indicate ten years. The\nman looked to be in his midthirties. He wore a finely trimmed brown beard,\nthough military regulation forbade it, and his hair was cut short above his\nears. Tamas gave the man a nod.\n“Olem, sir. Reporting.”\n“Thank you, Olem,” Tamas said. “You’re aware of the duties I need\nyou to perform?”\n“Bodyguard,” Olem said, “and manservant, errand boy. Anything the\nfield marshal bloody well pleases. No disrespect meant, sir.”\n“I take it those were Sabon’s words?”\n“Yes, sir.”\nTamas suppressed a smile. He could like this man. Too free with his\ntongue, perhaps.\nA thin ribbon of smoke rose from behind Olem.\n“Soldier, is your back on fire?”\n“No, sir,” Olem said.\n“The smoke?”\n“My cigarette, sir.”\n“Cigarette?”\n“All the latest fashion. Tobacco as fine as snuff, sir, and half the price.\nAll the way from Fatrasta. I roll them myself.”\n“You sound like an advertisement.” Tamas felt annoyance creeping on.\n“My cousin sells tobacco, sir.”\n“Why are you hiding it behind your back?”\nOlem shrugged. “You’re a teetotaler, sir, and it’s well known among the\nmen you won’t abide smoking either.”\n“Then why are you hiding it behind your back?”\n“Waiting for you to turn around so I can have a hit, sir.”\nAt least he was honest. “I had a sergeant flogged once for smoking in\nmy tent. Why do you think I’ll treat you any differently?” That had been\ntwenty-five years ago, and Tamas had almost lost his rank for it.\n“Because you want me to watch your back, sir,” Olem said. “It goes to\nlogic that you won’t hand out a beating to the man you expect to keep you\nalive.”\n“I see,” Tamas said. Olem hadn’t even cracked a smile. Tamas decided\nhe did like the man. Against his better judgment.\nThey examined each other for a moment. Tamas couldn’t help but\nwatch the ribbon of smoke rising from behind Olem. The smell reached him\nthen. It wasn’t terribly unpleasant, less pungent than most cigars, but not as"

There was even a minty tinge to it.\n“Do I have the job, sir?” Olem asked.\n“You really don’t need sleep?”\nOlem tapped the middle of his forehead. “I have the Knack, sir. Runs in\nthe family. My father could smell a liar from a mile away. My cousin can\neat more food than a hundred men, or none at all for weeks. My particular\nKnack? I don’t need sleep. I even have the third sight, so you know it’s the\nreal thing.”\nMen with a Knack were considered the least powerful among those with\nsorcerous ability. It usually manifested itself as one very strong and\nparticular talent, though some were quite powerful. There were plenty of\nmen who claimed to have a Knack. Only those with a third eye—the ability\nto see sorcery and those who wield it—were truly Knacked.\n“Why haven’t you been swept up as a bodyguard before?”\n“Sir?”\n“With a talent like that you could be running security for some duke in\nKez and making more money than a dozen soldiers. Or perhaps serving\noverseas with the Wings of Adom.”\n“Ah,” Olem said. “I get seasick.”\n“That’s it?”\n“Bodyguards to the rich need to be able to sail with them. I’m useless\non a boat.”\n“So you’ll watch my back as long as I don’t go sailing?”\n“Pretty much, sir.”\nTamas watched the man for another few moments. Among the troops,\nOlem was well known and well liked—he could shoot, box, ride, and play\ncards and billiards. He was an everyman as far as soldiers were concerned.\n“You’ve one mark on your record,” Tamas said. “You once punched a\nna baron in the face. Broke his jaw. Tell me about that.”\n‑\nOlem grimaced. “Officially, sir, I was pushing him out of the way of a\nrunaway carriage. Saved his life. Half my company saw it.”\n“With your fist?”\n“Aye.”\n“And unofficially?”\n“The man was a git. He shot my dog because it startled his horse.”\n“And if I ever have cause to shoot your dog?”\n“I’ll punch you in the face.”\n“Fair enough. You have the job.”\n“Oh, good.” Olem looked relieved. He removed his hands from behind\nhis back and immediately stuck the cigarette in his mouth and pulled hard.\nSmoke blew out his nose. “It would have gone out soon.”\n“Ah. I’m going to regret this, aren’t I?”\n“Of course not, sir. Someone’s here.”\nTamas caught sight of movement just inside. “It’s time.” He stepped\ntoward the balcony door and paused. The hounds rose from their sleep and\ncrowded around Tamas’s legs. He gave Olem a look.\n“Sir?”\n“You’re also supposed to get the door for me.”\n“Right. Sorry, sir. This might take me a while to get used to.”\n“Me too,” Tamas said.\nOlem held the door for Tamas. The hounds hurried in ahead of him,"

    "text": "“Right. Sorry, sir. This might take me a while to get used to.”\n“Me too,” Tamas said.\nOlem held the door for Tamas. The hounds hurried in ahead of him,\nnoses to the floor. The room was near-silent despite the growing volume of\nvoices in the Garden. Running on days without sleep, Tamas found the\nsilence soothing.\nHe was in a grand office, if a room so big could be called that. Most\nhouses could fit inside. It had been the king’s, a quiet place for him to study\nor review decisions by the House of Nobles. Like everything else that\nrequired a hair of a brain or a single krana’s care for how the country was\nrun, the room had remained vacant for the entirety of Manhouch’s reign—\nthough Tamas had it on good authority that Manhouch lent it to his favorite\nmistress last year, before his advisers found out.\nRicard Tumblar stood over a table of refreshments, picking through a\nstack of sugar cakes for the best ones. He was a handsome man despite his\nreceding hairline, with short brown hair and full features, and lines in the\ncorners of his mouth from smiling too much. He wore a costly suit made\nout of some animal hair from eastern Gurla, and his beard was worn long in\nFatrastan style. A hat and cane of equally eclectic and expensive taste rested\nby the door.\nRicard controlled Adopest’s only workers’ union and of all of Tamas’s\ncouncil of coconspirators; he was the only one that could provide pleasant\ncompany for longer than a few minutes. Hrusch and Pitlaugh sniffed at him\ntill he gave them each a sugar cake. The dogs took their prizes and retreated\nto the window divan.\nTamas sighed. He hated it when people fed them. They wouldn’t shit\nright for a week.\n“Help yourself,” Tamas said.\nRicard grinned at him. “Thank you, I will.” He popped a sugar cake in\nhis mouth and spoke around a mouthful. “You did it, old boy. I couldn’t\nbelieve it, but you did it.”\n“Not quite,” Tamas said. “The executions must be carried out, the city\nbrought to order; there will be riots and royalists, and I still have the Kez to\ndeal with.”\n“And a country to run,” Ricard added.\n“Lucky for me, I’ll leave that to the council.”\nRicard rolled his eyes. “Lucky you indeed. I dread working with the rest\nof them. We need your balancing hand to keep us from each other’s\nthroats.”\n“I agree,” Ondraus said.\nThe reeve entered the room at a slow walk, cane in one hand, a thick\nledger under the other arm. He crossed the room and tossed the ledger down\non the king’s desk, then dropped down in the chair behind it. Tamas stifled\na protest.\nOndraus opened the book. Tamas would have sworn dust rose from the\nthing. He stepped closer. It was an ancient tome, with gold-thread lettering\nstitched onto the front—a word in Old Deliv.

    "text": "stitched onto the front—a word in Old Deliv. Something about money,\nTamas guessed. The pages themselves seemed almost black. Closer\ninspection revealed tiny writing—letters and numbers boxed off, written so\ndensely as to require a looking glass to see the actual figures.\n“The king’s treasury is empty,” Ondraus announced. He produced a\nlooking glass from his pocket and set it on the page, peering through it as he\nperused a few numbers at random.\nRicard inhaled sharply, choking on a sugar cake.\nTamas stared at the reeve. “How?”\n“I haven’t seen this thing since the Iron King died,” Ondraus said,\ngesturing at the tome. “It records every transaction made in the name of the\ncrown for the last hundred years, to the krana. It’s been in the hands of\nManhouch’s personal accountants since he took the throne. They kept solid\nrecords; that’s the best I can say for them. According to this, there’s not a\nkrana in the king’s treasury.”\nTamas made a fist to stop his hands from shaking. How would he pay\nhis soldiers? How would he feed the poor and bankroll the police forces?\nTamas needed hundreds of millions—he’d hoped for at least tens.\n“Taxes,” Ondraus said, closing the ledger with a thump. “We’ll have to\nraise taxes first thing.”\n“No,” Tamas said. “You know that’s not an option. If we replace\nManhouch with even higher taxes, stricter control, then it’ll be our heads in\na basket within a year.”\n“Why should we raise the taxes?” Arch-Diocel Charlemund swept into\nthe room, long, purple robes of office trailing behind him. He was a tall\nman, strong and athletic, who’d not lost the power of his youth in middle\nage like most men. He had a square face and evenly set brown eyes, his\ncheeks clean-shaven. He was swathed in fine furs and silk, with a round,\ngilded hat upon his head. There were rings on his fingers with enough gold\nand precious stones to buy a dozen mansions. But that wasn’t uncommon\nfor an arch-diocel of the Kresim Church.\n“I see you brought the whole wardrobe,” Ricard said.\nTamas inclined his head. “Charlemund,” he said.\nThe arch-diocel sniffed. “I’m a man of the Rope,” he said. “I have a title\nyou may use, though it weighs upon me to inflict it.”\n“Your Eminence!” Ricard mimed removing a hat from his head and\nbowed low to the ground.\n“I wouldn’t expect a man like you to understand,” the arch-diocel said\nto Ricard. “I’d call you out, but you’re too much of a coward to duel.”\n“I have men to do that for me,” Ricard said. There was the slightest fear\nin his eye. The arch-diocel had been the finest swordsman in all the Nine\nbefore his appointment to the Rope and he was still known to call men out\non occasion and—priest or not—gut them mercilessly.\n“Property,” Tamas said to the reeve. “We own half of Adro now, what\nwith every nobleman and his heir about to find himself tasting the"

Ondraus, I expect you’ll take great delight in this:\nDissolve the property. Slowly, but fast enough to fund all the projects\nwe’ve discussed. Sell it outside the country if need be, but get us some\ndamned money.”\n“There were plans for that property,” the arch-diocel said.\n“Yes, and—”\n“What is being done with the property?”\nTamas sighed. Lady Winceslav entered the room in a gown that could\neasily compete with the arch-diocel’s robes for whose used the greater\namount of cloth and jewels in the tailoring. She was a woman of about fifty\nyears with high cheekbones and a slim waist, diamonds in her earrings. She\nowned the Wings of Adom, the most prestigious mercenary force in the\nworld, and was a native Adran. Her forces had been quietly pulled out of\nforeign postings and recalled to Adro over the last few months in\npreparation for the coup, and Tamas knew he’d need them desperately in\nthe time to come.\nClose behind her followed a big, bald man in a one-piece robe: the\nProprietor’s eunuch. Finally, Prime Lektor—Vice-Chancellor of Adopest\nUniversity—came in behind them. He was easily as old as the reeve and\nweighed ten stone more. He staggered over to a chair.\nAll six of Tamas’s coconspirators had arrived: five men and a woman\nwho had helped him plan Manhouch’s downfall and who would now\ndetermine the future of Adro.\n“By the pit, Tamas,” the vice-chancellor said, wiping the sweat from his\nforehead. A purple birthmark spidered across the lower left side of his face,\ntouching his lips and one eye. He wore a beard, but no hair would grow on\nthe birthmark, giving the old scholar a particularly barbaric appearance.\n“You had to choose the top floor? You’re going to regret it in a few years\nwhen your bones start to weary.”\n“Lady,” Tamas said, nodding to Lady Winceslav, then to the vice-\nchancellor and to the eunuch. “Prime. Eunuch. Thank you for coming.”\nThe eunuch slid over to the corner and glanced out a window. He\nmoved like an eel and smelled like southern spices, but the Proprietor, the\nstrongest figure in Adopest’s criminal element, never attended these\nmeetings personally—he sent his nameless lieutenant instead. “We had\nlittle choice,” the eunuch said. His voice was soft, like a child speaking in\nchurch. “You moved up the timeline.”\n“There’s more,” Charlemund said. His voice thundered unnecessarily.\n“He’s trying to claim the property we’ve confiscated from the nobility.”\nTamas held his hands up to calm a sudden clamor of voices. He glared\nat the arch-diocel. “We’re not here to carve up Adro,” he snapped. “We’re\nhere to give it back to the people. The king’s treasury is empty.

Your mercenaries will have land, Lady, and\nRicard your union will have its grants. Everyone will get a cut.”\n“Fifteen percent for the Church,” the arch-diocel demanded quietly,\nstudying his nails.\n“Go to the pit,” Ricard snapped.\n“I’ll send you there,” the arch-diocel said, stepping toward Ricard. A\nhand went into his robes. Ricard scrambled backward.\n“Charlemund!” Tamas said.\nThe arch-diocel stopped, turned to Tamas. “The Church will collect its\nnormal fifteen-percent tithe. This was the price of our support.”\n“The price?” Tamas said. “I thought this coup was sanctioned by the\nChurch because Manhouch was letting his people starve. Or was it because\nManhouch was taxing the Church in order to pay for his palace of\nconcubines? I don’t remember which. The Church will get five percent and\nbe happy with it.”\nThe arch-diocel took a step toward Tamas. “How dare you.”\nTamas matched the step. His hand twitched toward the small sword at\nhis hip. “Call me out,” Tamas said. “I’ll make it interesting and not choose\npistols.”\nThe arch-diocel hesitated. A smirk stirred at the corner of his lips. “If I\nwere to remove you, this nation would collapse into chaos and anarchy,” he\nsaid. “My first charge is toward my God. My second charge is to my\ncountry. I will speak to my fellow arch-diocels and see what I can do.” He\nremoved his hands from the robe, spreading them in a gesture of peace.\nTamas gave Charlemund an insincere smile. “Thank you.” He rested his\nhand on the hilt of his sword.\nThe eunuch spoke up. “If there isn’t any money in the king’s treasury,\nwhat has Manhouch been spending?”\n“The Church’s money,” the arch-diocel grunted.\n“Some of it,” Ondraus corrected. “He’s taken out enormous amounts of\ncredit with a number of banks all across the Nine. The crown owes the Kez\ngovernment nearly a hundred million krana.”\nRicard gave a low whistle.\nTamas turned to the reeve. “The crown is about to drop into a basket.\nOnce you’ve started to dissolve the nobility’s property, begin to pay back\nthe domestic banks. If there’s any money to be found, pay off our allies\nnext.”\n“It’s mostly to Kez,” Ondraus said with a shrug.\n“Good. Let them rot.”\nHe turned at the sound of laughter. The eunuch was still by the window.\nHe’d fetched himself a glass of chilled water and was now staring into the\nbottom. “Your personal vendetta against the Kez is going to see us all on\nthe wrong side of a headsman’s blade,” the eunuch said.\n“It’s not personal,” Tamas snapped.

That didn’t stop\nhim from denying it. “That debt explains why Manhouch was so eager to\nsign over Adro to the Kez.” He paused. “Have any of you actually read the\nAccords?”\n“They were meant to curtail the unions,” Ricard said.\n“And outlaw the Wings of Adom,” Lady Winceslav added.\n“Have any of you read the parts of the Accords that didn’t have\nsomething to do directly with yourselves?”\nSitting toward the back of the room, the vice-chancellor raised his hand.\nEveryone else avoided Tamas’s gaze.\n“They would have destroyed Adro as we know it,” Tamas said. “We\nwould have been slaves to the Kez in all but name. The people are starving,\nthe nation suffers under Manhouch and would suffer more under the Kez.\nThat is why we send Manhouch to the guillotine.” Not because the Kez did\nthe same to Tamas’s wife and Manhouch let it happen without protestation.\n“Are you going to say anything?” Lady Winceslav spoke up suddenly.\n“To whom?” Tamas said.\n“To the crowd. You need to speak to the people. Their monarch is about\nto be beheaded. They will be leaderless. They need to know they have\nsomeone to direct them, to get them through the times ahead.”\nThrough the almost inevitable war with Kez, she meant. “No,” Tamas\nsaid. “I’ll say nothing today. Besides, I’m not stepping in for the king. The\nsix of you are. I’m here to protect the country and keep the peace while you\ncreate a government with the interests of the people in mind.”\n“It would be wise to say something,” the vice-chancellor said, his\nbirthmark shifting strangely as he spoke. “To keep the peace.”\nTamas took them all in with his gaze. “The people want blood right\nnow, not words. They’ve wanted it for years. I’ve felt it. You’ve felt it.\nThat’s why we came together to pull Manhouch from his throne. I’m going\nto give them blood. A lot of it. So much it will sicken them, choke them.\nThen my soldiers will funnel them toward the Samalian District, where they\ncan loot the nobility’s houses and rape their daughters and kill their younger\nsons. I intend to let them choke on their madness. In two days’ time I will\nstifle the riots. Proclamations will be made. My soldiers will put down the\nrioters with one hand and give food and clothing to the poor with the other,\nand I will restore order.”\nThe six members of his council stared back at him silently. Lady\nWinceslav had paled, and Ricard joined the eunuch in a study of the bottom\nof his glass. Tamas would let them think on that. Let them consider what he\nwould do to protect his country, to see that justice is done and order\nrestored.\n“You are a dangerous man,” the arch-diocel observed.\n“You speak as if you can control a mob,” the eunuch said. There was\ndisdain in his voice.\n“Mobs can’t be controlled,” Tamas said. “But they can be unleashed."

After a few moments Tamas\ncontinued. “We’ve many other things to discuss.”\nTamas took a seat in the corner and did more watching than talking as\nhis coconspirators argued over the details of the coming months. Governors\nhad to be appointed, laws rewritten, workers paid. They had a long, hard\nroad ahead of them. He gave a low whistle, summoning the dogs, then\nrested a hand on each of their heads as he listened.\nTamas raised his head when the door to the balcony opened and he\nsuddenly realized he’d been dozing.\n“Sir,” Olem said. “It’s time.”\nTamas stood up, shaking the sleep from his head. He went to the door,\nholding it open for Lady Winceslav. “My lady.”\nThe group filed out onto the balcony. Tamas looked out over the Garden\nand the sight took his breath away. Not a single cobblestone could be seen\nbetween the pack of bodies below. People stood shoulder to shoulder, the\nmurmur of voices sounding like the lap of waves on the beach. The crowd\nfilled the King’s Garden to excess and poured out into the five connecting\nstreets. There was no end to the throng for as far as the eye could see.\n“Sir,” Olem said.\nTamas forced himself to look away from the crowd. He prided himself\non being a man who felt little fear, but the size of such a throng made him\nfeel small. He wondered briefly if he was mad. No one could control that\nwrithing mass. The looks on the faces of his companions assured him that\nthey shared his awe—even dry, annoyed Ondraus was speechless.\nTamas adjusted his hat to block out the noonday sun and ran a hand\nacross his cheek. He realized he hadn’t shaved in two days and the stubble\nwas thick on his jaw. Hardly appropriate for a field marshal in a dress\nuniform.\nThe sound below them had sunk to a barely audible whisper. He turned\nand felt a surge of his heart when he realized that every face was directed at\nhim.\n“Never have I seen a crowd so large. An audience so willing,” Tamas\nmurmured. “Is everything ready?” he said to Olem.\n“Yes, sir.”\nTamas scanned the rooftops of the surrounding buildings. His powder\nmages and his best marksmen lined those rooftops, rifles sighted into the\ncrowd. Tamas tried to picture the face of the Privileged who’d ripped apart\nhis mages the night before. Weathered, older, with gray in her hair.\nWrinkles in the corner of her eyes, and a robe that smelled of dust. He\nwondered if she’d show here in a bid to rescue the king. Up at Skyline\nPalace, visible on the horizon to the east, Taniel and the mercenaries were\npicking up her trail.\nTamas glanced at his companions on the balcony and wondered what"

He could sense that\nOlem’s third eye was open and examining the crowd.\n“Give the signal,” Tamas said.\nOlem lifted a pair of red signal flags. He waved them twice.\nThe gates to Sabletooth opened with a grinding shriek heard for half a\nmile around. The crowd turned away from Tamas, bodies twisting in giant\nwaves as their attention was fixed to the opposite side of the King’s Garden.\nTamas leaned forward, heart ringing like a hammer in his chest.\nMounted soldiers poured through the gates of Sabletooth. They pushed\ntheir way through the crowd. Tamas could make out Sabon’s shiny black\npate at the head of the column, shouting directions. The crowd was forced\nback and a cordon opened. A simple prison wagon followed them out.\nThe crowd roared as with one voice and surged forward. For a moment\nTamas feared that Sabon and his men would be pulled down. Would the\nking even reach the guillotine?\nThe soldiers pushed the crowd back. They inched across the square,\nsoldiers fighting the mob the entire time. The king’s cart came to rest before\nthe guillotines, right below Tamas’s balcony. Soldiers stretched out behind\nthe wagon, forcing the cordon to remain open like a giant snake through the\nmultitudes. Tamas swallowed a lump. Between the two rows of soldiers\nwas a string of over a thousand people, legs connected by chains. The string\nled all the way back to Sabletooth. They were nobles and their oldest sons,\nplus many of their wives. Their rumpled finery meant nothing in the jaws of\nthe mob as spittle and spoiled food flew past Tamas’s soldiers.\n“The headman’s going to retire after this one,” Olem said.\nThe sight both made Tamas’s heart soar and sickened him, all at once.\nThis was the culmination of decades of planning. He trembled in\nexcitement and shook with self-doubt. If there was one action he’d be\nremembered for in the histories, this would be it.\nThere was a commotion down Queen Floun Avenue to Tamas’s right.\nHis heart jumped into this throat. “Rifle,” he ordered.\nOlem handed Tamas a rifle.\n“Spare charge.”\nTamas took the spare powder charge and broke it between his fingers.\nHe touched the black powder to his tongue and felt an instant sizzle there.\nHe shuddered and clutched at the railing as the world warped in his sight.\nHe squeezed his eyes closed, and when he opened them, everything was in\nsharp focus. He could pick out individual hairs on the heads six floors\nbelow, and he could see half a mile down Queen Floun Avenue as if he was\nstanding there himself.\n“Dragoons,” he said. “A whole company.”\nThe dragoons wore the decorated uniforms of the king’s Hielmen and\npushed forward upon mighty warhorses. They shoved through the crowd as\nif it was an empty street, stampeding over women and children without a\nglance back. Swords were drawn, pistols out as they thundered forward."

Swords were drawn, pistols out as they thundered forward.\nOlem lifted the signal flag in one hand without being prompted. He\ntwirled it over his head, then leveled it horizontally down Queen Floun\nAvenue. Tamas could see black-coated men, mere dots in the crowds, begin\nto head in that direction. They were big, surly men from the famed\nMountainwatch, brought in just to work the crowds. The riflemen on the\nbuildings above Queen Floun Avenue shifted to look down upon the\ndragoons. Tamas spared a glance at Olem: Sabon had briefed him well.\nProfessional, unblinking, even when the Hielmen threatened the very heart\nof their plans.\n“Don’t fire until my signal,” Tamas said. Olem’s flag jolted out the\norder.\nThe dragoons slowed as they reached the King’s Garden. The crowds\nwere too thick even for their hundred-and-forty-stone animals. More bodies\ndisappeared beneath their horses as there was no place to flee. People\nturned toward the dragoons.\nThe Hielmen’s horses came to a complete stop. Where else could they\ngo? Climb upon the very heads of the mob? The Hielmen frantically urged\ntheir mounts forward as wails went up behind them, friends and families\nscreaming in anger, trying desperately to help their wounded.\nThe first Hielman was pulled off his mount and disappeared beneath the\nsurface of the crowd. Hands reached for the others, who began swinging\ntheir sabers in panic. A pistol shot went off, and the crowd responded as\none: with a roar of fury.\nOne Hielman lasted for several minutes, forcing his mount in a circle,\nhooves thrashing, sword swinging to hold off the crowds, before he joined\nhis comrades, pulled down and gone. Tamas heard a gasp of disbelief. Lady\nWinceslav fainted. A head rose above the crowd. It still wore a Hielman’s\ntall, plumed hat, but it most definitely lacked a body. It trailed blood and\ntissue as it was passed from hand to hand. Other heads soon joined it.\nTamas forced himself to watch. This was all his doing. For Adro. For\nthe people.\nFor Erika.\n“A bad way to go, sir,” Olem said. He took a drag of his cigarette,\nwatching the crowd with Tamas when even Charlemund had turned away.\n“Aye,” Tamas said.\nThe king and queen were led onto the guillotine platform. There were\nsix guillotines, lined up and ready, operators waiting at attention. Manhouch\nand his wife stood before the crowd, pelted by rotten food. Tamas blinked\nas a chunk of bloody meat slapped the queen in the face, leaving red\nsmeared on her alabaster skin and her cream nightgown. She fainted, falling\nto the floor of the platform.

They were making\ntheir way through the crowd, closer to the guillotine.\nThe king stared up at Tamas, then fumbled in his pocket, removing a\nsoiled piece of paper. He cleared his throat and started to speak, though\nTamas doubted anyone but the headsman could hear his words. The noise\ngrew as Manhouch tried to yell his speech, until he finally fell silent, chin\nfalling as he gave up. The headsman pulled on Manhouch’s chains. Frozen,\nthe king did not move until the headsman cuffed him on the back of the\nneck and dragged him to the guillotine.\nIt was a small blessing for them both, Tamas decided, that they were\nunconscious when the blade fell.\nManhouch’s head dropped into a basket below the machine, and a\nfountain of blood sprayed the closest onlookers, even though an area of ten\npaces had been cleared for that purpose. The queen was loaded into the next\nmachine as workers began to reset the first. Her head fell, a tumble of blond\ncurls.\n“This will take all day,” Ricard murmured.\n“Yes,” Tamas said. “And tomorrow, too. I told you I’ll give the people\nenough blood for them to choke on.” He looked down on the crimson pool\ngathering underneath the guillotine, spreading out under the nervous feet of\nthe nearest men and women. “It’ll soak the King’s Garden and stain the\nstones to rust.”\nTamas scanned the crowd one more time and stepped away from the\nbalcony. The Privileged hadn’t come. It left another enemy out there\nunaccounted for. No, he corrected himself. Not unaccounted for. Taniel\nwould find her. “The riots will start when people begin to get hungry,” he\nannounced to no one in particular. “We’ll impose curfew tomorrow. Until\nthen, I suggest you all stay off the street.”\nChapter 6\nAdamat hired a carriage to take him to Adopest University. It should not\nhave been a long trip, but it seemed that the entire population of Adopest\nwas heading toward the middle of the city, while the university was located\non the outskirts. By the time they reached Kirkamshire, the tide of humanity\nhad turned to a trickle. The university town was eerily quiet.\nThey’d all gone to see the execution. Tamas must have sent his fastest\nriders to the outskirts of the city to give everyone the chance to come see\nManhouch’s death. A risky move. The people would welcome it. Adamat\nwelcomed it. He only hoped that they hadn’t traded an idiot for a tyrant.\nA distant buzz caught his ear as he walked the deserted university\ngrounds. Adamat imagined it to be the roar of a million voices as the people\nwatched the king’s death. Looting would start soon, when people trickled\naway from the execution and realized everyone had left their doors\nunlocked, their shops untended. The riots would follow as brother turned\nagainst brother.

    "text": "He passed between the solarium and the library, his footsteps echoing in\nthe empty courtyard, and up the steps of the main administration building.\nThe mighty oak doors, banded with iron, were unlocked. Inside he passed\nby many office doors. He paused at a painting of the current vice-\nchancellor. Prime Lektor had been ugly, even in his youth, with a purple\nbirthmark obstructing a third of his face. It was said he was an unrivaled\nscholar. Adamat continued on past the vice-chancellor’s office to the next\ndoor down.\nIt was a small door, propped open with a wedge of wood, and it could\nvery well have been a janitor’s closet for all its bareness. From the hall\nAdamat could hear the scratching of an old-fashioned quill.\nAdamat knocked twice on the open door. A young-looking man sat\nbehind a plain desk in the corner of a cramped room. One might expect\nclutter in the office of the assistant to the vice-chancellor, but every scrap of\npaper, every book and scroll, was in its place and every surface dusted\ndaily. Adamat smiled. Some things never changed.\n“Adamat,” Uskan said. He set his pen in its holder and blew on the ink\nbefore setting the paper to one side. “A pleasant surprise.”\n“I’m glad you’re here, Uskan,” Adamat said, “and not watching the\nexecution.”\nA shadow flickered across Uskan’s face as he rounded his desk and\ncame forward to clasp Adamat’s hand. “One of my understudies has a very\ncreative pen. I told her to write down everything for posterity.” Uskan made\na disgusted face. “I have work to do. What need do I have for bloody\nspectacle?”\nAdamat examined Uskan. His friend did indeed look young, far younger\nthan forty-five years. He had the pinched face of a man who squints a lot,\nreading by too little light. “It’s the spectacle of the century,” Adamat said.\n“Of the millennia,” Uskan said. He returned to his desk and offered\nAdamat the only other chair in the room. “Never in the history of the Nine,\nsince their founding by Kresimir and his brothers, has a king been\ndethroned. Not once. I don’t even… I don’t even know what to say.” He\nbrushed the worried look from his face like a mote of unwanted dust. “How\nis Faye?”\n“Out of town with the children, thankfully.”\n“A stroke of luck.”\n“Yes.”\nUskan perked up. “How’s the printing press working? I’ve been knee-\ndeep in work for so long I haven’t even thought to send you a letter. Must\nbe exciting to see it work. The first steam-powered press in all of Adro!”\n“You hadn’t heard?” Adamat grimaced.\nUskan shook his head.\n“It exploded.”\nUskan’s mouth fell open. “No.”\n“Killed an apprentice and destroyed half the building. I’d stepped out\nfor a cup of tea and when I came back…” Adamat mimicked an explosion\nwith his hands. “No more Adamat and Friends Publishing.”\n“Surely you were insured.”\n“Of course. They refused to pay. I sued for damages. They found it\ncheaper to bribe the magistrate than to cover all my expenses.”"

    "text": "“Surely you were insured.”\n“Of course. They refused to pay. I sued for damages. They found it\ncheaper to bribe the magistrate than to cover all my expenses.”\nUskan’s mouth kept working silently. “I can’t believe it. That had all\nthe makings of fame and fortune. You’d be a wealthy man now if that had\nsucceeded. Why, I’ve just read in the papers that eleven bookstores have\nopened in Adopest alone in the last six months. Reading is becoming very\nfashionable. Poetry, novels, history. The industry is booming!”\n“Don’t rub it in.”\nUskan cringed. “Adamat. I’m so sorry.”\nAdamat waved a hand. “Things happen. It was nearly a year ago.\nBesides, I’m not here to talk about my troubles. I’m working.”\n“An investigation? At least you have that to fall back on.”\n“Yes.”\n“Anything I can do to help,” Uskan said.\n“I hope it won’t be a bother. I need to know about something called\n‘Kresimir’s Broken Promise,’ or ‘Kresimir’s Promise.’”\nUskan leaned back and frowned at the ceiling. “It sounds…” he said\nafter a few moments. “Something on the edge of my memory. But I do not\nrecall. Not everyone has your gift.” He stood up. “Let’s go look.”\nThey left the administration building and crossed to the library.\nSomeone had thought to lock the ancient doors of the big building, but\nUskan had his keys.\nThe vestibule was little more than a place to hang coats and wipe your\nshoes. Beyond that was one wide, open room with three tiered levels.\nStaircases and ladders seemed to be everywhere, with tables for research\nhaphazardly placed at the end of bookshelves or beneath windows.\n“I hope you have some idea of where to start,” Adamat said. It was easy\nto forget how big the library really was—Adamat hadn’t been there for\ndecades. “Else this will take all day.”\nUskan headed confidently to their right and up the nearest flight of\nstairs. “I think I do,” he said. “Though it might take a while. We’ve had\nsome major additions to our collection lately and I’ve not spent as much\ntime in the library as I want. Still, can’t complain about new books. The\nindustry is booming, but books are still expensive.” He glanced at Adamat.\n“A steam-powered printing press would have begun to change that.”\nAdamat rolled his eyes. Uskan meant well, but he spoke as if the\nexplosion had been Adamat’s fault.\nUskan counted rows of shelves before turning down one with purpose.\nHe grabbed a sliding ladder and pushed it along in front of him. His voice\nechoed in the empty space above them. “It used to be Jileman University\ngot all the good library grants. In fact, the Public Archives in Adopest is\ntwice the size of our collection. Why didn’t you go there first?”\nAdamat paused to run his fingers along a leather book spine. He liked\nlibraries. They were dry and dusty, with the smell of papers, the smell he\nassociated most with knowledge. To an inspector, knowledge was\nparamount. “Because the city center is a zoo right now.

To an inspector, knowledge was\nparamount. “Because the city center is a zoo right now. Execution,\nremember?”\nUskan turned to blink at him. “Oh, right.” He resumed pushing the\nladder. “If we don’t have luck here, go to the Archives. They’re quite well\norganized. Some very talented librarians down there. Cross-reference\n‘theology’ and ‘history.’ At least, that’s where I’m going to look first.”\nUskan halted the rolling ladder and climbed up it. The heavy iron rattled as\nhe climbed, and Adamat put a hand out to steady it.\n“I try not to reference theology at all.”\nUskan’s dry chuckle drifted down from ten feet up. “Who does these\ndays?” A pause. “Now, that’s strange.”\n“What?”\nThe ladder rattled as Uskan came back down. “The books are missing.\nSomeone must have checked them out. Only faculty are allowed to take\nbooks out of the library, and our school of theology is in shambles right\nnow. It consists of three brothers who spend half the year on sabbatical in\nwarmer climate. Hardly anyone studies theology anymore. It’s all about\nmathematics and science. Kresimir, our physics and chemistry departments\nhave quadrupled in size since I started here.” He glanced back up the ladder\nto the empty spots on the bookshelf. “I distinctly remember… no matter,\nlet’s look somewhere else.”\nAdamat followed his friend up to the third floor. The books he thought\nto find there were also missing. They looked in two more places before\nUskan leaned against a bookshelf and wiped his brow. “Someone must be\ndoing a theology dissertation,” he said. “Damned theology students always\ntake the books. We don’t get many these days, but when we do, they think\nthey own the place because their grandfathers gave this grant or that back in\nthe day.”\nAdamat wondered how much to tell him about his investigation. The\nwords had little danger on their own, but Adamat wanted as few people as\npossible to know the nature of his investigation. No sense risking being\nbranded a traitor before Tamas was in full power.\n“Do you have any books from the Bleakening? I’ve heard there is an\nabundance of writing on Kresimir from that time.”\n“Where did you hear that?”\n“A newspaper I read in early spring, three years ago.”\n“Bah, the newspapers will print any rubbish. It was a very religious\ntime, certainly, but the Bleakening was a dark ages bereft of knowledge.\nKresimir and his siblings had disappeared. The new monarchies were\nlocked in a struggle with the Predeii—an ancient caste of powerful\nPrivileged. Not much of anything survives from that period. The vice-\nchancellor once told me that if we had half the knowledge about sorcery\nand science that we did during Kresimir’s Time—most of which was lost\nduring the Bleakening—we’d be living in a golden age for noble and\npeasant alike.”\n“Well, try referencing theology, history, and sorcery.”\n“I’ll make a librarian of you yet,” Uskan said.\n“What do you know about sorcery?” Adamat asked."

    "text": "peasant alike.”\n“Well, try referencing theology, history, and sorcery.”\n“I’ll make a librarian of you yet,” Uskan said.\n“What do you know about sorcery?” Adamat asked.\n“Sorcerous philosophy is a bit of a hobby of mine, though I have no\ntalent for sorcery myself. My grandfather was a Privileged. A healer,\nactually.” Uskan paused here and gave Adamat an expectant look.\n“Yes?” Adamat prompted.\nUskan scowled. “A healer. They’re the rarest of Privileged. Even\nschoolboys with an introductory class on sorcery know that. It’s said the\nhuman body is so complex that only one of every hundred Privileged has\nmore than the most rudimentary healing capabilities.”\n“Rare, then?”\n“Very rare, Adamat. Lord, with your penchant for details one would\nthink you’d know about this sort of thing. Don’t you know anything about\nsorcery?”\n“Not really,” Adamat admitted. He lived in a world of city streets,\ncitizens, and criminals. He didn’t have time for sorcery and frankly, it was a\nforeign thing. He came across the odd Knack here and there, but stronger\nstuff was the realm of the cabals, and an inspector had no business with any\nof that. What he knew came from a few hours of schooling when he was a\nboy.\n“You’re a Knacked,” Uskan said, “so you have the third eye, correct?”\n“Yes, but I’m not sure what that has to do with anything…”\n“So you can see the auras of all things when you open your sight and\nlook into what Privileged call the Else?”\nNowadays Adamat rarely opened his third eye. It was an uncomfortable\nfeeling at best, but he remembered the glow that surrounded everything in\nthat sight, as if the world had been painted in vibrant pastels. “Yes.”\n“A Privileged manipulates the Else,” Uskan said. “Each of a\nPrivileged’s fingers is attached to one of the elements: Fire, Earth, Water,\nAir, and Aether.”\n“But fire isn’t an element,” Adamat said. “It’s the result of combustion.”\nUskan sniffed. “Bear with me. This explanation is recognized as\nimperfect in the light of discoveries of the last hundred years, but it’s the\nbest we have. Now, each finger corresponds to an element and to a\nPrivileged’s strength with that element, the thumb being the strongest digit.\nA Privileged uses his strong hand—most often his right—to call upon the\nauras of that which he wants to manipulate in the Else. He uses his off hand\nto direct those auras once they have been pulled into our world.”\n“So how does a powder mage’s magic work?”\n“Bugger if I know. Privileged hate powder mages, and the cabals have\nalways discouraged a study of them.”\n“Why such a strong hate?” Adamat had heard most Privileged were\nallergic to gunpowder.\n“Fear,” Uskan said. “Most Privileged’s spells have a range of less than a\nhalf mile. Powder mages can shoot from over twice that. The cabals have\nnever liked being at a disadvantage. I’ve also been told that whereas all\nthings, living or dead or elemental, have auras in the Else, gunpowder does"

    "text": "never liked being at a disadvantage. I’ve also been told that whereas all\nthings, living or dead or elemental, have auras in the Else, gunpowder does\nnot, and that makes Privileged nervous. Ah, here we are.”\nUskan paused in front of a bookcase. He ran his finger along several\nspines before taking them out and piling them into Adamat’s arms. Dust\nrose as the books thumped against each other. “Only one missing,” Uskan\nsaid. “I know just where it is, too. The vice-chancellor’s office.”\n“Can we get it?”\n“The vice-chancellor is away, summoned to Adopest early this morning\nwith some urgency. I don’t have a key to his office. We’ll have to wait until\nhe gets back.”\nThey retired to one of the tables with their stacks of books and set to\ntheir research. Adamat sat down and flipped open the first book. He\nfrowned. “Uskan?”\n“Hmm?” Uskan looked over. He leapt to his feet and rounded the table,\nmoving faster than Adamat had ever seen him. “What is this? Who the pit\ndid this?”\nThe first several pages of the book had been removed, and dozens after\nthat had whole sections of the text blacked out, as if someone had dipped\ntheir finger in ink and smudged it along the page. Uskan mopped at his\nforehead with a handkerchief and began pacing behind Adamat.\n“These books are invaluable,” he said. “Who would do such a thing?”\nAdamat leaned forward and squinted at the ripped line of the paper. He\njudged the book in his hands. It was made with vellum, thicker than today’s\npaper and four times as tough. The ripped edge was slightly blackened.\n“A Privileged,” Adamat said.\n“How can you tell?”\nAdamat pointed to the ripped edge. “Do you know of anything besides\nsorcery that could make a burn like that without damaging the rest of the\nbook?”\nUskan resumed pacing. “A Privileged! Kresimir damn them. They\nshould know the value of books!”\n“I think they do,” Adamat said. “Else they would have burned the whole\nthing. Let’s take a look at the rest here.” He reached for the next book, and\nthen the next. Of the eleven they’d removed from the shelf, seven had\npassages smudged or had pages ripped out. By the time they finished the\nstack, Uskan was fuming.\n“Wait till the vice-chancellor finds out! He’ll head straight down to\nSkyline and beat those Privileged senseless, he’ll—”\n“Tamas has executed the entire cabal.”\nUskan froze. His nostrils flared in and out, his lips bunched in a fierce\nfrown. “I suppose there will be no redress for this, then.”\nAdamat shook his head. “Let’s take a look at what we have.”\nThey spent some time with the books and they found eight different\nplaces where smudged writing could have been references to Kresimir’s\nPromise. Yet the passages were indecipherable.\n“That last book,” Adamat said. “The one in the vice-chancellor’s\noffice…?”\n“Yes,” Uskan said absently, scratching his head. “ ‘In Service of the"

    "text": "“That last book,” Adamat said. “The one in the vice-chancellor’s\noffice…?”\n“Yes,” Uskan said absently, scratching his head. “ ‘In Service of the\nKing.’ It outlines the duties of the royal cabals in their protection of the\nkings of the Nine. A very famous work.”\nAdamat smoothed the front of his coat. “Let’s see if he left his door\nunlocked.”\nUskan returned the books and chased Adamat out into the courtyard of\nthe library. “He won’t have left it unlocked,” he said. “Let’s just wait until\nhe gets back. The vice-chancellor is a private sort of man.”\n“I’m on an investigation,” Adamat said as he entered the main\nadministration building.\n“That doesn’t mean you have the right to look through other people’s\nstudies,” Uskan said. “Besides, the door will be locked.” He smiled\ntriumphantly at Adamat when the doorknob rattled but did not turn in\nAdamat’s hand.\n“No matter,” Adamat said. He crouched down and removed the tiny set\nof lockpicks he kept in one boot. Uskan’s eyes grew wide.\n“What? No, you can’t do that!”\n“When did you say the vice-chancellor will be back?”\n“Not until late,” Uskan said. “I…” He realized his mistake at once as\nAdamat began fiddling with the lock. Uskan huffed and slumped against the\nwall. “I should have told you, ‘Any minute,’” he muttered.\n“You’re a terrible liar,” Adamat said.\n“Yes, I am. And I won’t be able to lie to the vice-chancellor when he\nasks if someone’s been in his office.”\n“Come, now. He won’t know.”\n“Of course he will, how can…”\nThe lock clicked and Adamat pushed the door open gently. The office\ninside was more representative of what one might expect from a university\ntype. Books and papers were everywhere. There were plates of half-eaten\nfood on chairs, tables, even the floor. The entire room was walled by\nbookshelves twice as tall as a man, and those were overflowing, sagging\nwith the weight of too many books stacked haphazardly upon each other.\n“Don’t move anything,” Uskan said. “He knows exactly where he left\nevery item. He’ll know if…” Uskan fell silent at a look from Adamat.\n“Here, let me find the book,” he said sullenly.\nAdamat stayed at the edge of the paper-and-ink jungle that was the vice-\nchancellor’s office while Uskan looked for the missing book with the\nnatural grace of a secretary. Papers were lifted, plates and books shifted, but\neverything was returned to its exact place.\nAdamat stood on his toes and surveyed the room. “Is this it?” Adamat\nasked, pointing to the center of the vice-chancellor’s desk.\nUskan pulled his head out from beneath the vice-chancellor’s chair.\n“Oh. Yes.”\nAdamat stepped gingerly through the room. He lifted the book carefully\nand began to leaf through it. Uskan came up beside him.\n“No damaged pages,” Adamat reported. He scanned the pages, flipping\nthrough, looking for just two words to stand out. He found his prize in the\nbook’s afterword, on the last page."

He found his prize in the\nbook’s afterword, on the last page.\nAdamat read aloud: “And they will guard Kresimir’s Promise with their\nlives, for if it is broken, all the Nine might perish.” He scanned the page,\nand then the page after, and then the page before. There were no other\nreferences. He scowled at the pages. “This doesn’t make sense.”\nUskan’s finger stabbed the middle of the book, right at the spine.\n“What?”\n“More pages missing,” Uskan said. “Half the afterword.” His voice\ntrembled with rage.\nAdamat looked closer. Sure enough, the pages had been torn clean from\nthe book. The binding was different on this volume, making it difficult to\ntell that the pages were missing at all. He sighed. “Where can I find another\ncopy of this book?”\nUskan shook his head. “Maybe the Public Archives. I think Nopeth\nUniversity has a copy, too.”\n“I’m not sitting in a coach for the better part of a month just to ‘maybe’\nfind a book at Nopeth University,” Adamat said. He snapped the book shut\nand returned it to the vice-chancellor’s desk. “I’ll have to check the Public\nArchives.”\n“The riots,” Uskan protested as Adamat made his way to the door.\nAdamat paused.\n“They’ll have it locked up,” Uskan said. “The Archives contain tax\nrecords, family histories, even safe-deposit boxes. They have guards,\nAdamat.”\nThat was only a problem if they caught him. “Thanks for your help,”\nAdamat said. “Let me know if you find anything else.”\nChapter 7\nTaniel eyed the mob moving systematically down the street and wondered\nif they’d give him much trouble. The city was in chaos; wagons overturned,\nbuildings set ablaze, bodies left in the street to fall victim to looters and\nworse. The smoke hanging like a curtain over the city seemed as if it would\nnever blow away.\nTaniel flipped through his sketchbook randomly. The pages fell open to\na portrait of Vlora. He paused there for just a moment before he gripped the\nspine of the book in one hand and tore the page out. He crumpled it up and\nthrew it to the street. He stared at the jagged rip in his book and instantly\nregretted damaging it. He didn’t have money for a new sketchbook. He’d\nsold everything of value in order to buy a diamond ring in Fatrasta. That\ndamned diamond ring he’d left nailed to a fop in Jileman. He could still see\nthe blood spreading from the man’s shoulder, crimson dripping from the\nring he’d slid on the man’s sword before he shoved it in. Taniel should have\nkept the ring. He could have pawned it. He forced a lump down in his\nthroat. He regretted not saying something—anything—to Vlora as she stood\nin the bedroom door, sheets clutched to her chest.\nHe checked the time on a nearby clock tower.

Any of the mob left out after\nmidnight would have to deal with Field Marshal Tamas’s men. The soldiers\nmight have a hard time of it. There were a lot of desperate people in\nAdopest these days.\n“What do you think of these mercenaries?” Taniel asked. He bent over\nand picked up the rumpled sketch of Vlora and smoothed it on his leg, then\nfolded it and tucked it into his sketchbook.\nKa poel shrugged. She watched the approaching mob. They were led by\n‑\na big man, a farmer with worn, old overalls and a makeshift truncheon.\nProbably moved to the city to work in a factory but couldn’t join the union.\nHe saw Taniel and Ka poel standing in the doorway of a closed shop and\n‑\nturned toward them, raising his truncheon. More victims to be had.\nTaniel ran a finger along the fringe of his buckskin jacket and touched\nthe butt of a pistol at his hip. “You don’t want any trouble here, friend,” he\nsaid. Ka poel’s hands tightened into little fists.\n‑\nThe farmer’s eyes fell to the silver powder keg pin on Taniel’s chest. He\ncame up short and said something to the man behind him. They turned\naway suddenly. The rest followed, dark looks for Taniel, but none of them\nwilling to get mixed up with a powder mage.\nTaniel breathed a sigh of relief. “Those two hired thugs have been gone\na long time.”\nJulene, the Privileged mercenary, and Gothen, the magebreaker, had left\nto follow the Privileged’s trail almost an hour ago. She was close, they’d\nsaid, and they’d scout her out, then come back for Taniel and Ka poel.\n‑\nTaniel was beginning to think they’d been abandoned.\nKa poel jerked her thumb at her own chest and then shaded her eyes,\n‑\nthrusting her head out as if looking for something.\nTaniel nodded. “Yeah, I know you can find her,” he said, “but I’ll let\nthese mercs do the groundwork. That’s all they’re gonna be good for any —\n”\nTaniel’s head cracked against the stone of the building at his back, his\nears pounding from the sudden explosion. Ka poel rocked into him and he\n‑\ncaught her before she could fall. He steadied her on her feet and shook his\nhead to dispel the ringing in his ears.\nHe’d been half a mile from a munitions dump once when the powder\ncaught fire. This had felt like that kind of explosion, but his Marked senses\ntold him it wasn’t powder. It was sorcery.\nA gout of flame shot into the air not two city blocks from them. As\nquickly as it was there, it was gone, and Taniel heard screams. He checked\non Ka poel. Her eyes were wide, but she seemed unhurt. “Come on,” he\n‑\nsaid, and broke into a run.\nHe ran past the mob, all scattered on the cobbles like so many children’s\ntoys knocked down by an angry fist, and turned the corner to head toward\nthe explosion.

He hit\nthe ground and immediately pushed himself up, sparing barely a glance for\nthe person he’d run into.\nHe was two steps into running again when what he’d seen caught up\nwith him: an older woman with gray hair, a plain brown jacket and skirt,\nand Privileged’s gloves.\nTaniel whirled, drawing his pistol.\n“Stop!” he shouted.\nKa poel careened around the corner, directly into his line of fire. He\n‑\nlowered his pistol and ran toward her. Over her small shoulder he watched\nthe Privileged turn. Her fingers danced, and Taniel felt the heat of a flame\nas the Privileged touched the Else.\nTaniel grabbed Ka poel and flung them both toward the ground. A\n‑\nfireball the size of his fist tore past his face, hot enough to curl his hair. He\nlifted his pistol and sighted, feeling the calm of the powder trance take him\nas he concentrated on the aim, the powder, and his target. He pulled the\ntrigger.\nThe bullet would have hit the woman’s heart had she not stumbled at\nthat moment. Instead it took her in the shoulder. She twitched with the\nimpact and snarled at him.\nTaniel looked around. He needed someplace to take cover and reload.\nAn old brick warehouse twenty paces away would do. “Time to go,” Taniel\nsaid to Ka poel. He jerked her to her feet and ran for the warehouse.\n‑\nOut of the corner of his eye he watched the Privileged’s fingers dance.\nIt was a fascinating thing, watching a Privileged touch the Else—if that\nPrivileged wasn’t trying to kill you. With their mastery of the elements a\nskilled Privileged could throw a fireball or call lightning.\nTaniel felt the ground shudder. They got behind cover of the warehouse,\nbut the building rumbled. He felt the scream wrench itself from his throat in\nanticipation of the powers that would tear through the building and destroy\nthem.\nThe building cracked, jerked, but it didn’t explode. Smoke billowed\nfrom sudden cracks in the mortar. An audible wump split the air. Then\neverything was still. They were alive. Something had stopped whatever\nsorcery the Privileged had been about to throw at them.\nTaniel glanced at Ka poel. He felt a shaky breath escape him. “Was that\n‑\nyou?”\nKa poel gave him an unreadable look. She pointed.\n‑\n“After her. Right. Come on.”\nHe sprinted out into the street, switching his spent pistol for a loaded\none. He paused a moment when he saw Julene and Gothen running toward\nthem.\nJulene looked like a keg of powder had exploded in her face. Her hair\nwas scorched, her clothes blackened. Even Gothen had a wild look in his\neyes and black marks on his shirt, and sorcery wasn’t supposed to be able to\ntouch him. The sword in his hand was missing a foot of blade.\n“What the pit did you two do?” Taniel said. “You were supposed to\ncome back and get me before going after her.”\n“We don’t need a damned Marked getting in our way,” Julene replied\nwith a rude gesture."

He gave\nTaniel a sheepish look. “But she did.”\n“And she did that?” Taniel pointed at Gothen’s broken blade.\nGothen frowned. “Oh, for pit’s sake.” He threw the half sword on the\nground.\n“We stand here talking and we’ll lose her,” Taniel said. “Now, Julene,\ntry to flank her, I’ll—”\n“I don’t take orders from you,” Julene said, leaning forward. “I’ll go\nstraight down her throat.” She tugged at her gloves and took off running\ndown the street.\n“Damn it!” Taniel slapped Gothen’s shoulder. “You’re with me.”\nThey headed down a side street, then onto the next main thoroughfare,\nrunning parallel to Julene.\n“What the pit happened?” Taniel asked.\n“We found her in an astronomer’s shop,” Gothen said between gasps as\nhe ran, swords, buckles, and pistols rattling. “We circled the place, checked\nall exits, and laid our trap. We were just getting ready to go in after her\nwhen the whole front of the building blew off. Julene barely shielded\nherself. I could feel the heat of the explosion! That’s not supposed to\nhappen. I should be able to nullify any aura she can summon from the Else.\nNo fire, no heat, no energy from it should reach me, but it did.”\n“So she’s powerful.”\n“Very,” Gothen said.\nTaniel saw Julene sprint past an alleyway the next street over. He came\nup short and took a deep breath, motioning for Gothen to stop. Something\nwas wrong. He turned around.\n“Ka poel?”\n‑\nShe’d stopped in the mouth of the alley. She put a finger to her lips, her\neyes half-lidded. She pointed down the alley.\nTaniel gestured for Gothen to go first. He would void any traps or\nsorcery flung at them. Taniel lifted his pistol, keeping it aimed just over\nGothen’s shoulder. The alley was filled with debris—trash, mud, and shit; a\nfew half-rotted kegs. Nothing big enough for a person to hide behind. It was\nwell lit by the noonday sun.\n“There!” Gothen surged forward, and Taniel caught a movement in the\nalley up ahead. He blinked, trying to see clearly. It was as if light were\nturning in on itself, making a slight shadow where a person could hide.\nThen the Privileged appeared. Her hands twitched and she leveled them\nat Gothen. Gothen braced himself.\nThe air shimmered, distorted by a furnace of impending sorcery. Gothen\nyelled, the veins on his neck standing out. Taniel fired.\nThe bullet glanced off her skin as if it were metal, ricocheting\nharmlessly down the alley. The Privileged threw her hands out. Gothen\ntumbled backward and fell to the ground.\nThere were handholds built into the brick side of the building for roof\naccess.

The Privileged climbed them with the ease and speed of someone\nfar younger, and was over the roof two stories up before Taniel could reload\none of his pistols. He took a snort of powder and climbed up after her.\n“Don’t lose her!” Taniel shouted back to Gothen. Ka poel raced back\n‑\nout into the main street to track the Privileged’s progress.\nTaniel made it to the roof and swung up over. The Privileged leapt to\nthe next roof over and spun, throwing a fireball. The powder trance burned\nthrough Taniel. He could see the auras of her sorcery, could feel the path\nthe fireball would take. He ducked and rolled, then came back to his feet.\nShe fled, clattering and sliding across the clay-tiled roof.\nTaniel cleared the next gap easily. He lost sight of the Privileged with\nthe slant of the roof, then found her again as she crested the next roof over.\nHe fired off a shot.\nHe hit her once again, but once again she didn’t go down. It had been a\nsquare shot, right to the spine. She should have been dead, or at the very\nleast wounded and bleeding. She hardly stumbled.\nTaniel snarled. He put away his pistols and swung his rifle into his hand.\nHe fixed his bayonet. He’d do this the hard way.\nA powder mage in a full trance could run down a horse. He was within\nfeet of her in two more buildings. She leapt between roofs. Her toe barely\ncaught the lip of the next. She slipped and fell, grabbing the tiles.\nTaniel cleared the roof with space to spare. He skidded to a stop and\nturned, ready to put his bayonet through her eye. She let go of the roof and\nfell to the street below.\nTaniel swore. He hesitated only a moment before jumping after her.\nEven in the height of a powder trance his knees ached and his body\nshivered when he hit the ground. He landed in a crouch next to the\nPrivileged, who was already on her feet. He reacted on instinct, thrusting\nhis bayonet. He felt it slide home.\nThe woman slumped above him, her gloved hand a mere foot from his\nhead. She had the face of an aging woman who’d once been very beautiful,\nher skin now lined and weathered, crow’s feet in the corners of her eyes.\n‑\nShe let out a gasp, then jerked herself off the end of Taniel’s bayonet.\n“You’ve no idea what’s going on, boy.” Her voice was a deadly whisper.\nTaniel heard the jingle of Gothen’s weapons as the magebreaker ran up\nbeside him, his pistol leveled.\nTaniel felt the earth rumble.\n“Get down!” Gothen leapt between Taniel and the Privileged.\nThe ground splintered and cracked and fell out from under them.\nTaniel’s whole body screamed at the pressure released. He felt as if he’d\nbeen jammed into the bottom of a cannon and used as fuel for an explosion.\nHis ears popped, he felt dizzy. His head pounded.\nMasonry rained down all around them.\nWhen the dust began to clear, Taniel saw Gothen still crouching over"

The magebreaker opened one eye. His lips\nmoved, but Taniel couldn’t hear a thing. The whole world wavered. Taniel\ngot to his feet and looked around. Ka poel approached him through the\n‑\nhaze. Julene was not far behind. The buildings on either side of him were\ncompletely gone, leveled to their foundations, damp basements filled with\nrubble and hovering curtains of dust. There were smears of blood and bits\nof flesh in the debris. There had been people in those buildings—people\nwho hadn’t had a magebreaker standing between them and the explosion.\nTaniel drew a shaky breath.\nJulene marched straight up to Taniel and knocked him off his trembling\nlegs with a shove. Ka poel slid in between them, her silent glare driving\n‑\nJulene back a step. It was several moments before Taniel could hear well\nenough to know what Julene was shouting.\n“… let her go! You let her get away! You bloody fool!”\nTaniel climbed to his feet. He gently pushed Ka poel out of the way by\n‑\nthe shoulder.\nJulene stepped forward and punched him full in the face. His head\njerked back. He reacted without thinking, grabbing her next blow out of the\nair and twisting her hand. He slapped her. “Back the pit off.” Taniel turned\nand spit blood. “She’s dead. There’s no way anyone could have lived\nthrough that.”\n“She’s not dead.” Julene’s cheeks were flushed, but she made no move\nto continue the fight. “I can still feel her. She got away.”\n“I ran her through with three spans of steel! She wasn’t walking away\nfrom that.”\n“You think steel can hurt her? You think it can really hurt her? You\ndon’t know shit.”\nTaniel took a deep, calming breath, then a snort of powder. “Ka poel,”\n‑\nhe said. “Is she still alive?”\nKa poel hefted the end of Taniel’s rifle in her small hands and drew her\n‑\nfinger through the blood along the bayonet’s edge. She smeared it between\nher fingers. After a moment she nodded.\n“Can you track her?”\nKa poel nodded again.\n‑\nJulene scoffed. “I can’t even track her,” she said. “She’s covered her\ntrail. Even wounded she’s far more powerful than you can know. This\ndamned girl can’t find her.”\n“Pole?”\nKa poel snorted and turned away. She paused a few moments to get her\n‑\nbearings, then pointed.\n“We have a heading,” Taniel said. “Get yourself under control and\nwatch how a real tracker does it.” He gestured to Ka poel. “Lead on.”\n‑\nTaniel shaded his eyes from rain and looked up at Julene. She stood above\nhim, arms folded, a belligerent smile twisting the scar on her face. “It’s\nbeen two days,” she said. “Admit your pet savage can’t track this bitch and\nwe’ll get out of this rain and tell Tamas there’s a problem.”"

Storm\ndrains collected everything, from human waste to dead animals and\nwhatever garbage and mud piled up in the streets. During a storm like this,\nall of it was swept down into the large sewers beneath the city. This drain\nwas clogged, leaving Taniel up to his shoulder in rainwater and filth, and he\nwas enjoying it just about as much as he was enjoying Julene’s constant\nbadgering. “You know Tamas won’t pay you until the job’s done, don’t\nyou?” he reminded her.\n“We’ll find her,” Julene said. “Just not today. Not in this rain. She\ncaused this storm. I can feel it. The auras swirl, summoned from the Else. It\nmuddies her trail too much, but once the rain has cleared up, I’ll find her\ntrail again.”\n“Ka poel already has her trail.” Taniel stretched a little farther, his cheek\n‑\ntouching the squalid puddle he lay in. He felt something hard, wrapped his\nhand around it, and pulled it out.\n“She’s been scraping her fingernails between street cobbles and having\nyou dig in every ditch between here and… what the pit is that?”\nTaniel climbed to his feet. The glob of gray mud in his hand looked like\nthe scrapings from a hundred boots. His stomach crawled at the smell of it\nand he held it at arm’s length. The whole mass clung to a long piece of\nwood. With a squelching, sucking sound the puddle at his feet slowly began\nto drain.\n“Broken cane, I think,” Taniel said.\nKa poel came over to examine the stinking mud. She poked it with one\n‑\nfinger, her head held up and away, scrutinizing the whole mass down the\nbridge of her nose. Her fingers darted in suddenly, then came out, pinched\ntogether.\nJulene leaned forward. “What’s that?” She shook her head. “Nothing.\nStupid girl.”\nTaniel washed his arm in the cleanest puddle he could find, then took\nhis shirt and buckskin coat from Gothen. To Julene, “You need sharper\neyes. It’s a hair. The Privileged’s hair.”\n“That’s impossible. To find a single hair from the Privileged in all this\nmuck. Even if it did belong to her, what can your savage do with it?”\nTaniel shrugged. “Find her.”\nKa poel walked away and opened her satchel. She worked with her\n‑\nback to them for a few moments. When she turned around, she straightened\nher satchel on her shoulder and gave a brisk nod. She tapped herself in the\nmiddle of the chest and then made a grasping motion.\nTaniel grinned as he buttoned up his shirt. “We have her.”\nThey flagged down a hackney cab. Ka poel sat up with the driver to\n‑\ndirect him, and Taniel, Julene, and Gothen climbed inside. Julene made a\ndisgusted sound a moment after the door closed."

Julene made a\ndisgusted sound a moment after the door closed.\n“You smell like filth,” she said. “I’d rather be in the rain than in here\nwith you. I’ll be on the footboard.” She swung back outside. A moment\npassed, and then the carriage jerked forward.\n“Ka poel can track the Privileged with a hair?” Gothen asked after\n‑\nthey’d been moving for several minutes, his knees knocking uncomfortably\nclose to Taniel’s.\n“Hard to do it with one hair,” Taniel said. “Helps if there’s more. The\nblood from my bayonet, a discarded nail in the street—this Privileged bites\nher nails—an eyelash. One bit leads to the next. The more she has, the\neasier it is to track. If we want to sneak up on this Privileged, we need a\nprecise location.”\nTaniel opened his sketchbook and flipped through it, pausing briefly on\nthe sketch of Vlora tucked between two pages, before moving on to a half-\nfinished drawing of the Privileged. He was sketching from memory, but\nhe’d been the only one of the four of them to get a good look at her. Gothen\nscanned the drawing for a few moments. When he finished, Taniel snapped\nthe book shut, returning it to his jacket.\n“How does Ka poel’s sorcery work?” Gothen asked.\n‑\n“No idea,” Taniel said. “I’ve never seen her do magic. Not what we\nthink of as magic, anyway. No fingers twitching, no summoning elemental\nauras.” He’d long ago stopped trying to figure out her sorcery.\nGothen cleared his throat after a minute. He didn’t look at Taniel\ndirectly, but a sly smile crossed his face. “Julene and I, we have a bet.”\nTaniel tapped out a line of powder on the back of his hand and snorted\nit. “What’s that?”\n“Julene thinks you’re bedding the savage. I say you aren’t.”\n“Not exactly the bet of a gentleman,” Taniel said.\n“We’re all soldiers here,” Gothen said. His grin widened.\n“How much was the wager?”\n“A hundred krana.”\n“So much for women’s intuition. Tell her she owes you a hundred.”\n“Thought so,” Gothen said. “Men are so much easier to read than\nwomen. You look at her—the savage—like that once in a while, but even\nthen it’s only a hint of longing, not the look of a lover.”\nTaniel scowled at the magebreaker and shifted in his seat, not sure how\nto respond. In an officers’ setting he’d call a man out for that. Here,\nthough… well, like Gothen said, they were both soldiers.\n“She’s nothing more than a kid,” Taniel said. “Besides, the whole time\nI’ve known Ka poel, I’ve been engaged to another woman.”\n‑\n“Ah. Congratulations.”\n“The engagement is off.”\n“Your pardon,” Gothen said, looking away.\nTaniel tapped out another line on the back of his hand.

He waved his\nsnuffbox in the air dismissively. “Think nothing of it.” He snorted the black\npowder and took a deep breath, then leaned his head against the side of the\ncarriage. He listened to the patter of rain on the rooftop, to the clatter of the\nhorse’s hooves and the wheels on the cobbles. So many noises that could\ndrown out his thoughts.\nWhere was Vlora, he wondered, at this moment? Perhaps just arriving\nin Adopest. Maybe already here and gone, sent off on assignment by\nTamas. He’d forced the question out of his mind every silent moment since\nhe’d nailed that fop to the wall, wriggling on his own sword like a pinned\nbutterfly. What had gone wrong? He’d made a mistake, going off to\nFatrasta like he did. Getting tangled up in a war just to impress Tamas.\nHe’d left her alone for too long. The man who’d bedded her was a\nprofessional philanderer. It wasn’t her fault.\nHe made a fist, reeled in his anger. Was he mad because he loved Vlora?\nOr was he mad because another man had sullied his woman? Had Vlora truly\nbeen his woman? Taniel couldn’t remember a time at which he wasn’t going\nto marry Vlora. Tamas had thrust them together in every possible situation.\nShe was a gifted powder mage, and chances were their children would be\ngifted as well. Tamas had encouraged them to be together for years. If\nanything, Vlora was more Tamas’s future daughter in law than she\n‑ ‑\nwas ever Taniel’s future wife. He swallowed that thought, and with it the\nsatisfaction with Tamas’s disappointment. Now Taniel didn’t have to marry\nat all if he didn’t want—or he’d find a wife of his own, not some\nprearranged powder-mage bride. Maybe Ka poel. Taniel chuckled aloud,\n‑\nignoring Gothen’s curious glance. Tamas would be absolutely livid if\nTaniel married a foreign savage. His amusement died down, and he resisted\nthe urge to open his sketchbook and look at Vlora’s drawing.\n“Awfully nice part of town,” Gothen said, pulling Taniel from his\nthoughts. The magebreaker held back the curtain just enough to see outside.\nA moment later the carriage jostled to a stop. Taniel opened the door.\nThey were in the Samalian District. Thick smoke hung over the entire\ncity, mixing with the light rain and stinging Taniel’s eyes. The place was\nsilent—the mob had been quelled two days prior and in their wake had left\nlittle of what had once been rows of stately manors. Smoldering ruins and\ngutted houses were all that remained.\nExcept this one. The townhouse was three stories tall, and made of\nancient gray stone. It had been modeled after castles of old with parapets\nand walks. The walls were blackened from the fires raging around, but the\nbuilding itself seemed undamaged. It was easy to see why.\nThe parapets were manned by soldiers. Cobbles had been torn up from\nthe street and made into a waist-high wall in front of the main entrance."

Ka poel climbed down from beside the driver.\n‑\n“Whose house is this?” Taniel asked the driver.\nThe man scratched his chin. “General Westeven’s.”\nA squad of soldiers issued from the townhouse and headed straight\ntoward them. Taniel felt his gut wrench. They wore the all-too-familiar\ngray-and-white uniforms and the high, plumed hats of the king’s Hielmen.\nThe Hielmen were supposed to have been wiped out. Yet here they were,\nguarding the residence of the former head of the king’s guard. General\nWesteven was nearly eighty, ancient by all standards, yet it was said he was\nstill sharp and alert. Of all of Adro’s commanders, only Westeven had the\nreputation to match Tamas.\n“Is the general in the city?” Taniel asked. Surely Tamas would have\ndealt with him. A loose end like this couldn’t have been left.\n“Heard a rumor he was back,” the driver said. “He was supposed to be\non holiday in Novi. He cut it short and returned just yesterday.”\nTaniel glanced at Ka poel. “You sure she’s here?”\n‑\nKa poel nodded.\n‑\n“Pit.”\nThe Hielmen halted five paces from Taniel. Their captain was an older\nman with a sour face. He was taller than Taniel by half a hand, and when\nhis eyes fell on Taniel’s powder keg pin, his lip curled into a sneer.\n“You’ve a woman inside your house,” Taniel said, fingering his pistol.\n“A Privileged. I’m here to arrest her in the name of Field Marshal Tamas.”\n“We don’t recognize the authority of traitors here, boy.”\n“So you admit you’re protecting her?”\n“She’s the general’s guest,” the captain said.\nA guest. Hielmen under the command of General Westeven and now\nthey had a Privileged? This was dangerous territory. He could see rifles in\nwindows on the floors above and on the parapets. The Hielman captain\nwore a sword and a pistol. Two of his guards carried long, slender rifles\nwith fist-sized cartridges attached underneath—air canisters on air rifles.\nWeapons specifically designed to be unaffected by a powder mage’s power.\nNo doubt some of the marksmen above carried the same weapons.\nWith Julene and the magebreaker he could probably fight his way into\nthe manor. Soldiers were one thing to deal with, the Privileged another.\nHe could feel when Julene touched the Else. He held up a hand. “No,”\nhe said. “Back down.”\n“Like pit I will,” Julene said. “I’ll burn through this lot and—”\n“Gothen,” Taniel said. “Rein her in.” He had to get away from here.\nWarn Tamas.

He’d attack quickly and go straight for the heart.\nTaniel moistened dry lips. “We’re going.”\n“Sir,” one of the Hielmen said. “That’s Taniel Two-Shot.”\nThe captain’s eyes narrowed. “You’re not going anywhere, Two-Shot.”\n“In the carriage,” Taniel said. “We’re leaving. Driver!”\nThe soldiers lowered their muskets. Taniel leapt onto the footboard of\nthe carriage. He drew his pistol, swung around. He shot one of the Hielmen\nin the chest before the man could bring his weapon to bear. He tossed his\npistol through the carriage window and looked toward the Hielmen,\nreaching out with his senses for their powder. Two of them carried standard\nmuskets and the captain had a pistol. They’d all have powder reserves.\nHe found their powder horns easily. He touched the powder with a\nthought, causing a single spark.\nThe explosion nearly knocked him off the carriage. The horses\nscreamed, and Taniel held on for dear life as the animals fled in terror. He\ntook one look back. The Hielman captain had been blown clear in two. One\nof his companions struggled to sit up. The rest were in bloody pieces in the\nroad. No one bothered to fire at the fleeing carriage.\nWhen the driver finally got control of his animals, Taniel stuck his head\ninto the carriage.\n“I could have torn through them,” Julene said.\n“And gotten us all killed. They had at least two dozen soldiers with air\nrifles watching us, not to mention the Privileged inside. I want you two to\nget out. Keep an eye on that townhouse. If the Privileged leaves, follow her\nbut do not try to fight your way in.”\n“Where are you going?” Gothen asked.\n“To warn my father.”\nTaniel climbed up beside the driver and told him to slow down for a\nmoment. Gothen and Julene exited out the other side, jumping to the ground\nand heading into an alley. Taniel half hoped they’d try the manor against\nhis orders, just so he didn’t have to deal with them again. But he needed\nthat magebreaker.\n“You’ll be paid well,” Taniel said to the driver.\nThe driver nodded, his mouth in a firm line.\n“Take us to the House of Nobles,” Taniel said. “As quick as you can.”\nChapter 8\nOlem,” Tamas said, “did you know someone wrote a biography about me?”\nOlem perked up from his at ease position beside the door. “No, sir, I\n‑\ndidn’t.”\n“Not many do.” Tamas pressed his fingers together and watched the\ndoor. “The royal cabal had them all bought up and burned—well, most of\nthem anyway. The author, Lord Samurset, fell out of favor with the crown\nand was banished from Adro.”\n“The royal cabal didn’t like his portrayal?”\n“Oh, not at all. He was very favorable toward powder mages. Said they\nwere a fantastically modern weapon that would one day replace Privileged\naltogether.”\n“Dangerous conjecture.”"

    "text": "“Oh, not at all. He was very favorable toward powder mages. Said they\nwere a fantastically modern weapon that would one day replace Privileged\naltogether.”\n“Dangerous conjecture.”\nTamas nodded. “I’m just vain enough to have rather enjoyed the book.”\n“What did he say about you?”\n“Samurset claims that my marriage made me conservative, that my\nson’s birth gave me mercy, and that my wife’s death hardened both\nqualities with an objectiveness to make them useful. He said that my climb\nto the rank of field marshal while on the Gurla campaign was the best thing\nto happen to the Adran military in a thousand years.” Tamas waved his\nhand dismissively. “Rubbish, most of it, but I do have a confession.”\n“Sir?”\n“There are times when I don’t feel a sense of mercy or justice or\nanything but pure rage. Times that I feel I’m twenty again and the solution\nto every problem is pistols at twenty paces. Olem, that is the most\ndangerous feeling a commander can have. Which is why, if I look like I’m\nabout to lose my temper, I want you to tell me. No fidgeting, no polite\ncoughs. Just plain out tell me. Can you do that?”\n“I can,” Olem said.\n“Good. Then send in Vlora.”\nTamas watched his son’s former fiancée enter the room with no small\nbit of trepidation. Many thought of Tamas as cold. He encouraged the\nnotion. Perhaps his son had suffered for that. But Tamas knew that beneath\nhis calculating nature he had a temper, and for the first time in his life he\nwanted to shoot a woman.\nTamas interlocked his fingers on the desk in front of him. He fixed his\nmouth into that ambiguous place between smile and frown.\nVlora was a dark-haired beauty with a classic figure, wide hips and a\nsmall chest outlined by the tight blue uniform of an Adran soldier. Her\nfather had been a na baron who had lost his fortune speculating in all the\n‑\nwrong things. The last of their family wealth had gone to a gold mine in\nFatrasta—one that pinched out two months after mining began. He had died\na year after that last failure, when Vlora was only ten. Sabon had found her\nmonths later, placed in a boarding school by her few remaining relatives; an\nabandoned child with a unique talent: the ability to ignite powder from not\njust a dozen paces, as most Marked could, but at a distance of several\nhundred yards. Tamas had taken her in, provided for her upbringing, and\ngiven her a career in the army. What had gone wrong?\n“Sir,” she said, snapping to attention before him. Tamas found himself\nlooking at an invisible point above her head as he struggled to restrain his\nanger. “Powder Mage Vlora reporting, sir.”\nTamas flinched. She’d called him Tamas since she was fourteen. Not\none soul had ever commented on that brazen familiarity. She’d treated him\nmore like a father than Taniel ever had.\n“Sit,” Tamas ordered.\nVlora sat.\n“Sabon apprised you of the situation?” He could feel her studying his\nface. He kept his own gaze in the air above her head."

He kept his own gaze in the air above her head.\n“We’ve lost a lot of men, sir,” she said. “A lot of friends.”\n“A serious blow to the powder cabal. I need mages now. I’d have liked\nto leave you…” At Jileman University, he finished in his head. Where she\ncould continue her studies and continue betraying his son. Tamas cleared\nhis throat. “I need you here.”\n“I’m here,” she said.\n“Good,” Tamas said. “I’m going to put you with the seventy-fifth\nregiment on the north end of the city. There’s rioters up there to mop up\nand…” Tamas paused at a low knock on the door. Olem opened the door\njust a little. A communiqué was passed through, and there was a moment of\nwhispering between the bodyguard and someone on the other side.\n“Tamas,” Vlora said suddenly. “I’d like to be put with Taniel, if that is\npossible.”\nTamas felt his body jerk and pulled back on the reins of his rage.\n“That’s ‘sir’ if you please, soldier,” he snapped. “And no, it’s not possible.\nThis city needs to be cleaned up and I’ll have you with the seventy-fifth\nregiment.” He would not put Taniel through that. He was cold, not cruel.\nOlem waved the communiqué. “Sir,” he said.\n“What is it?”\n“Problems.”\n“Of what sort?”\n“The boys have run into barricades.”\n“And?”\n“Big ones, sir, though hastily built. Very well organized. Not average\nlooters.”\n“Where?”\n“Centestershire.”\n“That’s less than a mile from here. Have they made contact with the\nbarricade?”\n“Yes,” Olem said. He didn’t look happy. “Royalists, sir.”\n“They had to come out of the woodwork eventually,” Tamas said.\n“Damned king’s men without a king. Numbers?”\n“Not a clue. They appear to have gone up overnight.”\n“What’s the extent of their holdings?”\n“I said, sir. Centestershire.”\n“What, the whole center of the city?”\nOlem nodded.\n“Bloody pit.” Tamas leaned back in his chair. He let his eyes fall to\nVlora, his anger at her betrayal warring with the stupidity of men who’d\nthrow their lives away over a dead monarch. He felt his hands shaking.\n“Why?” The word wrenched out against his will. He scolded himself\nimmediately. He had better control than that. He forced himself to meet\nVlora’s eyes. Why did you betray my son?\nHe saw sorrow in those eyes. A lonely, sad girl. The eyes of a child\nwho’d made a horrible mistake. It made him furious. He stood, his chair\nthrown to the ground behind him.\n“Sir!” Olem barked.\n“What?” Tamas practically yelled at the man.\n“Not the time or place, sir!”\nTamas felt his jaw working soundlessly.

    "text": "“Not the time or place, sir!”\nTamas felt his jaw working soundlessly. I did tell him to stop me.\nThe door to the office burst open. Taniel stumbled in, breathing hard as\nif he’d run up all five flights of stairs. He stopped in the doorway, frozen in\nplace at the sight of Vlora.\nVlora stood. “Taniel.”\n“What is it?” Tamas said, the calm in his voice forced.\n“General Westeven is in league with the Privileged.”\n“Westeven is in Novi on holiday. I made sure of it before the coup.”\n“He returned yesterday. I’ve just come from his home. It’s guarded by\nat least two dozen Hielmen. We tracked the Privileged there but couldn’t\nforce our way inside. She is a guest of his.”\n“He has to be out of the city. They may just be using his house as a base\nof operations.”\nTaniel strode into the room, stopped beside Vlora, his eyes on his father.\n“If Westeven is in the city, he’ll move quickly. He could strike at any time.”\nTamas leaned back, taking in the information. General Westeven, the\nlongtime retired captain of the Hielmen, was a legend. The man\ncommanded respect from noble and commoner alike and had won battles\nacross half the world. He was one of the few military men, foreign or\ndomestic, that Tamas truly saw as an equal. And he was a king’s man\nthrough and through.\nTamas slid his dueling-pistols case across the desk to rest in front of\nhim and began to load one. “Olem, eject anyone from this building that isn’t\na member of the seventh brigade. Once the House of Nobles is secure, we’ll\nsee about those barricades. General Westeven may be behind them.”\nOlem left the room at a run.\nThe rest followed Tamas out into the hallway and down the stairs. Olem\nmet them again on the second floor. The place was packed with people—\ncity folk, peasants, poor merchants. It seemed like half the city filled the\nhallways. Olem had to push his way through to get to Tamas.\n“Sir,” Olem said, “There are too many people in the building. It’ll take\nus hours to clear all the rooms.”\nTamas scowled. “Who are all these people?” A line had formed, and\nTamas couldn’t see the front of it. He grabbed the closest man, an\nironworker, by his thick overalls with the hammer stitched to one pocket.\n“What are you here for?”\nThe man trembled slightly. “Um, sorry, sir, I’m here to debate my new\ntaxes.” He spread his hand toward the line. “We all are.”\n“New taxes haven’t been issued,” Tamas said.\n“For the king!”\nA gunshot went off near Tamas’s ear and the man slumped to the\nground before he’d been able to draw his dagger halfway. Vlora\nimmediately began reloading her pistol. On Tamas’s other side, Taniel had\ndrawn both of his.\nThe entire hall burst into motion.

    "text": "from beneath them weapons were drawn—swords, daggers, pistols—a few\neven had muskets. What had a moment before been an aimless line of city\nfolk and commoners became an armed mob.\nThey fell on Tamas’s soldiers with the same shout: “For the king!”\nOlem flung himself between the greater part of the crowd and Tamas.\nHe fired a pistol and then drew his sword, cutting down three of the\nroyalists in as many blinks of the eye. Tamas yanked his sword out and\nbellowed, “To me! Men of the seventh brigade, to me!”\nSoldiers caught unawares were cut down. The hall was too crowded\nwith the royalists, their trap sprung. But they weren’t expecting three\npowder mages or Olem’s trained ferocity.\n“Back to the stairs, sir,” Olem yelled. “Up to the next floor!”\nThey cut their way toward the stairs in a fighting retreat. The royalists\nattacked en masse, trying to gain the advantage through numbers. Tamas\nstepped up beside Olem to hold them back while Vlora and Taniel fired\ntheir pistols from behind them. The staircase was soon full of the thick\nsmoke from spent powder. Tamas breathed it in and savored it.\nGray-and-white uniforms emerged from the hall. Hielmen—what was\nleft of Manhouch’s personal guard. There were twelve of them. They\ncarried the best air rifles with bayonets fixed and charged forward without\nhesitation. These were not simple royalists. They were trained killers,\nnotches even above Tamas’s best soldiers. They would not waver or retreat\nuntil they were dead.\nThe Hielmen carried air rifles, but the rest of the rabble did not. Tamas\nfelt Vlora ignite a powder horn, and a man nearest the Hielmen exploded,\nshowering the lot of them with gore and knocking two flat. Tamas reached\nout with his senses and ignited the powder in a man’s unshot musket. The\nunexpected blast blew the face off the woman next to him.\nThey made it up the stairs to the third floor, the Hielmen dogging their\nheels. They started up for the fourth floor when the popping sound of air\nrifles filled the air. It was a sound to chill a Marked’s blood, for a Marked\nknew that shot was meant for him.\nVlora stumbled on the stairs and fell. Taniel, farther up the stairs, leapt\nto her in an instant, sliding the ring bayonet over the end of his rifle and\nmeeting the Hielmen’s charge with a silent snarl. His bayonet sliced a\nHielman’s neck with the quick, easy motion of a trained butcher. He\ndodged to one side of a bayonet thrust and grappled with another Hielman.\nThe man was a hand taller than him and at least three stone more. Taniel\nbrought up the butt of his rifle in a blow savage enough to put the\nHielman’s nose into his brain. The soldier dropped without a sound. Tamas\nfelt a thrill watching his son fight. Taniel Two-Shot he might be, but he had\nthe brutal hand to hand skills of an infantryman.\n‑ ‑\nTaniel swung toward the four remaining Hielmen, ready to charge."

Deep in a\npowder trance, her body seemed to weigh nothing at all. She gritted her\nteeth against the pain. “Did it hit a bone?” Tamas asked.\nShe shook her head.\nTamas heard a pop and felt the bullet graze his left shoulder, missing\nVlora’s head by inches. Tamas turned around only to look down the length\nof an air rifle, the bayonet coming toward his gut fast.\nHe transferred Vlora’s weight to one arm and drew his pistol and shot\nfrom the hip, dropping the Hielman dead from a bullet through the eye.\nBy the time Tamas reached the fifth floor, the last few Hielmen lay dead\non the stairs. Tamas and his men assessed their wounds. Olem had a\nnumber of new cuts—they’d need stitching, but nothing more. Vlora’s shot\nhad glanced off her thigh. She could handle pressure on it, so the bullet had\nnot shattered the bone, and she’d be fine. Taniel had not been touched. His\nface was twisted in a savage grimace as he wiped gore from the end of his\nbayoneted rifle. At some point Ka peol had joined them. The red-haired girl\n‑\nsmelled of sulfur, and her hands were black. She wiped her hands on her\nbuckskins and smiled at Tamas when she saw him looking.\nPistol shots and the sound of steel on steel faded on the floor below.\nTamas took a few deep breaths, listening to Vlora’s heart beat. They both\nleaned against the wall, her head on his shoulder. He stepped away from\nher.\nFootsteps echoed on the stairs below them. A moment later Sabon\nappeared. He had powder marks on the cuff of his jacket and a shallow\nsword gash along one arm. He breathed a quick sigh of relief on seeing\nthem all together.\n“Anyone hurt?” Sabon asked.\n“Minor wounds,” Tamas said. “Where were you?”\n“The officers’ mess. They came out of nowhere.”\n“Casualties?” Tamas asked. Anyone important?\n“A few,” Sabon said. He gave a slight shake of his head at the silent\nquestion. “From the looks of things it was mostly rabble. Took us by\nsurprise, but once we’d rallied the men, it was barely a fight. All the\nHielmen came straight for you.”\n“Is the House secure?”\n“Working on it.”\n“Enemies captured?” Tamas asked.\n“We’ve taken at least two dozen without a fight. Probably another forty\nwounded. They’re General Westeven’s men.”\n“I know.” Tamas stepped over to his son and laid a hand on his\nshoulder. “Well done, Taniel.”\nTaniel unfixed his bayonet and put it in its case. He shouldered his rifle.\nOne glance to Vlora and then a stiff nod to Tamas. “Back to work, sir.”\nTamas watched his son descend the stairs, followed closely by the\nsavage girl. He felt like he should say something else. He wasn’t sure what.\n“Sabon.”\n“Sir?”"

The mercenaries will need to start earning\ntheir pay. Prepare me a command base near the barricades. We take the\nfight to him. Vlora.” He paused, considering his decision for a moment.\n“Go with Sabon. I want you on my staff.”\n“Taniel!”\nTaniel stopped on the landing and glanced back up the stairs, trying to\ndecide whether to wait or not. He knew that voice. He didn’t want to hear\nanything it had to say. He nudged a body with his toe. One of the Hielmen\nhe’d gutted with his bayonet. The man’s eyes fluttered. Still alive. He\nglared up at Taniel. He gritted his teeth, not making a sound, but he must\nhave been in immense pain. Taniel debated whether to call a surgeon or to\nkill him. The wound was mortal. Taniel squatted next to him.\n“You’ll not live out the week,” Taniel said.\n“Traitor,” the Hielman whispered.\n“Do you want to live another day or two, kept alive so that you can\nanswer to Tamas’s questioners?” Taniel asked. “Or end it now?”\nThe man’s eyes betrayed his suffering. He remained silent.\nTaniel undid his belt and folded it over, offering the end to the man.\n“Bite on this.”\nThe Hielman bit down.\nIt was over in a handful of heartbeats. Taniel wiped his knife on the\nHielman’s trousers and jerked out his belt from between the man’s teeth. He\nstood up, buckling the belt back on. Why did he do this? He should be off at\nthe university, chasing girls. He tried to think back to the last time he’d\nchased a girl. His first night in Fatrasta, before the war began, he’d met a\ngirl at a dockside bar. They’d flirted all night. A little drunker and he might\nhave slept with her, but he’d kept his head about him and remembered\nVlora. He wondered if that girl was still there. He had a sketch of her in his\nbook.\nThe Hielman lay at his feet, at peace despite the scrambled gash in his\nstomach and the fresh crimson line dripping from his throat. Ka poel stood\n‑\na few feet away, silent as always. She watched the dead Hielman as if\nfascinated.\n“We should go,” Taniel said to Ka poel.\n‑\n“Taniel, wait.”\nVlora hurried down the stairs. She stumbled, caught herself on the\nrailing, and sank down to sit on the steps halfway down. She held one hand\nover the wound on her thigh.\nThey stared at each other for a moment.

Tamas hadn’t even been fazed by the sudden attack.\nA warrior through and through.\nA few soldiers passed them, two going up, one going down. There was\na commotion in the main hall downstairs as Tamas’s soldiers rounded up\nwounded prisoners.\n“Forgive me,” Vlora said.\nTears streaked down her face. Taniel fought the impulse to rush to her\nside, to see to her wound and comfort her. He could sense her pain,\nemotional and physical, but it could not touch him in his powder trance. He\nrefused to let it touch him. He hooked his thumb through his belt and\nsquared his jaw.\n“Let’s go,” he said to Ka poel.\n‑\nAdamat ground his teeth in frustration. Seven days since the coup. Seven\ndays since he’d visited Uskan and gotten only more questions for his time.\nWho’d been burning pages from books on religious and sorcerous history?\nWho’d taken the other books? And what the pit was Kresimir’s Promise?\nAdamat stopped his hackney cab in Bakerstown long enough to grab a\nmeat pie, then continued on past Hrusch Avenue, where the dusty smell of\noil, wood, furnaces, and gunpowder whirled between the gunsmith shops\nand foundries. Here the noise was louder than usual, the crowds thicker. A\nboy sat on the step of every shop with a bundle of papers, taking orders and\nreporting numbers as well-dressed gentlemen rubbed shoulders with the\nlowliest infantryman. A hawker stood on the street corner and yelled that\nthe new Hrusch rifle would protect a man’s home. The gunsmiths were\nselling the rifles as fast as they could make them.\nAdamat flipped through the day’s paper. It said that Taniel Two-Shot\nwas in the city, returned a hero from the Fatrastan War for Independence.\nNow he was chasing after a rogue Privileged. Some said the Privileged was\na surviving member of the royal cabal. Others said it was a Kez spy,\nkeeping an eye on Tamas’s powder cabal. Either way, an entire block had\nbeen leveled already, and dozens had been killed or wounded. Adamat\nhoped the Privileged would either be caught or would leave the city\naltogether before more blood could be shed. There was going to be enough\nof that in the coming face-off between Westeven and Tamas.\nThe royalists had barricaded off Centestershire, nearly the whole middle\nof Adopest. They’d launched a preemptive attack against Tamas’s forces,\nonly to be driven back. Now it seemed the population was holding its\nbreath. General Westeven, nearly eighty years old, had rallied the entire\nroyalist population of the city, gathered them in one spot, and made enough\nbarricades to stop a damned army.

Not a shot had been fired yet. Both men were\nexperienced enough not to want to turn the middle of Adopest into a\nbattlefield.\nIt was a damned nightmare, Adamat decided. Two of the Nine’s most\ncelebrated commanders facing off in a city of a million people. No one\ncould come out a winner from that.\nYet life went on. People still needed to work, to eat. Those not involved\ndirectly in this new conflict stayed well away from it. Tamas had done an\nadmirable job at keeping the peace in the rest of the city.\nTo complicate matters, the Public Archives, where Adamat was most\nlikely to find copies of the damaged books at the university, were behind\nthe royalist barricades. It was not a place he was prepared to go alone.\nThe carriage came to a stop in front of a three-story building off a side\nstreet at the far end of High Talian, the slums of Adopest. There was but a\nsingle entrance on this street, with a faded olive-green double door. Half of\nit was closed, blocked from inside, the paint peeling and the masonry\ncrumbling around the doorpost. The other half was open, and a man of\nsmall stature leaned against the opposite post.\nAdamat fetched his hat and cane from the carriage and held them in one\nhand, the other seeking a handkerchief from his pocket, which he used to\ncover his mouth as he stepped out. He paid the driver and approached the\ndoorway, listening absently to the clatter of hoofbeats behind him as the\ncarriage pulled away.\n“Where in Kresimir’s name did you find an apple this time of year,\nJeram?” Adamat wiped his nose and stuffed the handkerchief in a pocket.\nThe doorman gave him a slant-toothed smile. “G’evening, sir. Haven’t\nseen you for a month or two.” He took a crunching bite of his apple. “My\ncousin in the south of Bakerstown gets fresh fruit all year-round.”\n“They say we might go to war with the Kez if negotiations don’t go\nwell,” Adamat said. “You’ll have to wait until next fall for another apple.”\nJeram made a sour face. “Just my luck.”\n“How go the fights today?”\nJeram pulled a worn piece of paper from the brim of a threadbare hat\nand studied it to make out the most recent markings. “SouSmith’s done\nthree in a row, Formichael has won twice today. The two of them look\nready to drop, but it’s the foreman has a death bug in his britches, says the\ntwo of them are gonna fight it out this hour.”\n“Five fights between the two of them already?” Adamat snorted. “It’ll\nbe piss poor, they’ll barely be able to stand.”\n“Aye, that’s what the tables are saying, and there’s not much wagers\nyet. Everybody that’s betting has put it on Formichael.”\n“SouSmith hits hard.”\nJeram gave him a sly glance. “If he can land a punch. Formichael’s\nbetter rested, younger, and half SouSmith’s weight.”"

Formichael’s\nbetter rested, younger, and half SouSmith’s weight.”\n“Bah,” Adamat said, “you young ones always think the old have\nnothing left in them.”\nJeram chuckled. “Right, then, what’ll it be, governor?” He removed a\nfolded paper from his back pocket, covered in smudges and long-erased\nlines. He set it against the doorframe and poised a piece of charcoal over it.\n“What are the odds?”\nJeram scratched his cheek, leaving a bit of charcoal there. “I’ll give you\nnine to one.”\nAdamat raised his eyebrows. “Give me twenty-five on SouSmith.”\n“Risky,” Jeram grunted. “Figures.” He scratched down the numbers and\nfolded the piece of paper, then jammed it back in his pocket. Adamat knew\nthe paper was just for show. Jeram had a memory almost as good as\nAdamat’s, and without a Knack—he never forgot a face, never forgot a\nnumber, and had not once delivered wrongly on a bet, though many times\nwas accused of such. That didn’t happen often nowadays, not since the\nProprietor took over this boxing ring. He didn’t take kindly to anyone\naccusing his bookies.\nInside, the only light came from rectangular slat windows high up under\nthe eaves. Adamat pushed past a series of curtains that muffled sound and\nhid the inside from prying eyes. The whole building was one big room, long\nsince gutted, with a few stalls and cordoned-off rooms to give the fighters\nsome privacy to recover from fights. In the middle was the building’s\nnamesake: the Arena, a round pit twelve paces across, four paces below\nfloor level.\nA latticework of haphazard seating surrounded the pit, going back to\neither side of the building and nearly to the roof. Adamat ducked beneath\nthe rear seating, crossed to the other side, and elbowed his way in among\nthe men crowding the edge of the pit. The stands were full, men shoulder to\nshoulder in all the seats, enough for a few hundred gentlemen with their\ncanes and hats, street workers with frayed jackets, and even a pair of city\npolice officers, their black capes and top hats hard to miss among the\ncrowd.\nA fight had finished perhaps ten minutes ago, and the Arena workers\nwere throwing down sawdust to soak up the blood, readying for the next\none. A quiet murmur filled the room as men talked among themselves,\nresting their voices to cheer the violence ahead. Adamat breathed in sweat\nand grime and the smell of anger. He let his breath out slowly, shuddering.\nBareknuckle boxing was a barbaric, feral sport. He grinned to himself. How\nfun. He took another breath, catching a whiff of pig. Not long ago the Arena\nhad been a sty, and before that? A series of shops, maybe, back when High\nTalian was supposed to be the newest, richest, most fashionable part of the\ncity.\nA pair of shirtless men left the fighters’ stalls at the end of the room.\nThey entered the Arena side by side and without ceremony.

    "text": "city.\nA pair of shirtless men left the fighters’ stalls at the end of the room.\nThey entered the Arena side by side and without ceremony. The workers\ncleared out, and the fighters faced each other. The man on the left was\nsmaller, leaner, his muscles corded and defined like a warhorse. His curly\nbrown hair bobbed into his face now and then, and he blew it away each\ntime. Formichael. The Proprietor’s favorite fighter—or he had been when\nAdamat had last come by the fights. He was a warehouse worker, young\nand handsome, and it was whispered the Proprietor was grooming him to be\nsomething more than a simple thug.\nThe man on the right looked twice Formichael’s size. His hair had a\ntouch of gray at the sides, his face bore a poorly shaved beard. His eyes\nwere piggish, set deep in his face, and they examined Formichael with the\nsingular intensity of a killer. His arms looked big enough to win a wrestling\nmatch with a mountain bear. Pits marred his knuckles where they’d broken\n—and been broken by—men’s jaws, and his face was covered in the\npuckered scars of bad stitching jobs. He flashed a set of broken teeth at\nFormichael.\nDespite SouSmith’s advantage in size and experience, he was obviously\ntired. His chin sagged from a long day of hard-won fights, the corners of his\neyes betraying exhaustion, and his shoulders drooped ever so slightly.\nWhat’s more, experience had long worn out its welcome. SouSmith was\ngetting old, and his chest and stomach had given way to flab from excess\ndrinking.\nThe foreman descended to the second step of the ring and conferred\nwith the two fighters. After a moment he stepped back. He held up his hand,\nand then dropped it, leaping back.\nThree hundred men yelled as the two fighters lashed out at each other.\nFists met flesh with dull slaps that were drowned out by the surge of voices.\n“Kill ’em!”\n“Make him bleed!”\n“The gut! Flush him in the gut!”\nAdamat’s voice was drowned out in the cacophony of wordless cries.\nHe didn’t even know what he said, but his heart poured all his frustration\nwith Palagyi, his anger that his wife and children were away, into his\nshouts. He leaned forward, fists flailing in mockery of the two men,\nscreaming at the top of his lungs with the rest of the rabble.\nFormichael connected with a vicious jab to SouSmith’s ribs. SouSmith\nstumbled to the side, and the younger man surged forward and pounded on\nthe same spot, perhaps on an old broken rib, fists flashing in the dim light.\nSouSmith reeled, trembling, toward the side of the pit until he was up\nagainst the wooden slats that separated him from the crowd. Fingers\nreached out from the onlookers, nails gouged at his bare head, spittle\nsplattered on his cheek. Adamat watched, the fighter’s head just beyond his\nreach. “Go on,” he shouted. “Don’t let him back you into a corner!”\nSomething audibly cracked, and SouSmith fell to one knee, hand up in\nfront to ward off Formichael’s blows.\nAdamat’s voice fell to a whisper. “Get up, you bastard,” he growled"

    "text": "Something audibly cracked, and SouSmith fell to one knee, hand up in\nfront to ward off Formichael’s blows.\nAdamat’s voice fell to a whisper. “Get up, you bastard,” he growled\nthrough his teeth.\nFormichael punched SouSmith’s hands and arms, beat them down until\nthe older man was on both knees, suffering under the onslaught.\nFormichael’s face flushed with the promise of victory and he slowly let up\nuntil the punches were mere taps, then altogether. He stood, chest heaving,\nexamining the man at his feet. SouSmith didn’t look up.\nBah, Adamat thought. Finish him already.\nBut there was nothing of that in Formichael’s plans. Grinning, he bent\nover and grabbed one of SouSmith’s arms, pulling him up into a single,\nbrutal punch. SouSmith went back to his knees, his whole body shuddering.\nFormichael would string this out, letting SouSmith’s exhaustion keep him\ndown and continuing the beating until SouSmith was nothing but a pulp.\nFormichael delivered several more single punches before letting\nSouSmith fall back down to his hands and knees. SouSmith’s face was a\nmess of blood and pulped flesh. He spit into the sawdust. Formichael\nturned, raised his arms to the crowd, bathed himself in the roar of voices.\nHe faced SouSmith once again.\nThe big man rose to his feet in less than a heartbeat, all twenty-five\nstone following his fist into Formichael’s pretty young face. The impact\nlifted Formichael off the ground. His body flattened out in midair and then\nbounced like some child’s toy off the wooden slats before tumbling to the\nground. He shuddered once before falling still. SouSmith spit on\nFormichael’s back and turned away, plodding up the stairs and toward the\nfighters’ stalls. Hands reached out to slap him on the back in\ncongratulations; curses lashed out for bets lost.\nAdamat collected his winnings and then waited until enough of the\ncrowd was milling about to slip unnoticed back to the stalls. He entered\nSouSmith’s room and closed the curtain behind him. “That was quite the\nfight.”\nSouSmith paused, a bucket lifted over his head, and gave Adamat a\nsingle glance. He tipped the bucket, letting the water wash away a layer of\nsweat and blood, then scrubbed his body with a soiled towel. He tilted his\nhead at Adamat, the skin around his eyes puffy and bruised, his lips and\nbrows split. “Aye. Make the right bet?”\n“Of course.”\n“Bastard’s trying to kill me.”\n“Who?”\n“Proprietor.”\nAdamat chuckled, then realized SouSmith wasn’t joking. “Why do you\nsay that?”\nSouSmith shook his head, twisted the red-brown water out of his towel,\nand dunked it in a clean bucket. “Wants me to sink.” SouSmith was far\nfrom stupid, but he’d always spoken in short sentences. A man had trouble\ncollecting his thoughts after years of being punched in the head.\n“Why? You’re a good fighter. People come to see you.”\n“People come to see young whips.” SouSmith spat into one of the\nbuckets. “I’m old.”\n“Formichael will think twice next time he’s told to fight you.” Adamat"

    "text": "“People come to see young whips.” SouSmith spat into one of the\nbuckets. “I’m old.”\n“Formichael will think twice next time he’s told to fight you.” Adamat\nremembered the still body on the Arena floor. They’d had to carry him out.\n“If he’s still alive.”\n“He’ll live.” SouSmith tapped the side of his head. “He’ll be afraid.”\n“Or maybe he’ll just be sure to finish it quick,” Adamat said.\nSouSmith took a deep breath, then let out a chuckle that turned into a\ngrunting cough. “Not bad either way.”\nAdamat watched his old friend for a moment. SouSmith was a different\nman than his appearance suggested. He was no average thug, not like the\nother boxers. Behind his beady eyes was a sharp intelligence; behind his\ngnarled fists the soft hands of brother and uncle. Many read him wrong, one\nof the reasons for his winning record. One thing no one read wrong, though:\nBehind it all, even deeper than his loyalty to his family or his cleverness, he\nwas a killer.\n“I have a question for you,” Adamat said.\n“Thought you missed me.”\n“You once told me you were part of the street gang Kresimir’s Broken.”\nSouSmith froze with the corner of the towel still in one ear. He lowered\nit slowly. “I did?”\n“You were very drunk.”\nSouSmith’s movements were suddenly cautious. He glanced toward the\nstall’s single desk, to a drawer where he no doubt had hidden a pistol. Yet a\nman his size didn’t need a pistol.\nAdamat made a reassuring gesture. “You were very drunk,” Adamat\nsaid again. “I didn’t believe you at the time. I was there when they pulled\nthose boys out of the gutter. I didn’t think anyone had escaped what went\nafter them.”\nSouSmith examined him for a few moments. “Maybe one didn’t,” he\nsaid. “Maybe one did.”\n“How?”\nSouSmith countered with his own question. “Why?”\n“I’m doing an investigation.” Adamat had already decided to tell\nSouSmith the whole story. “For Field Marshal Tamas. He wants to know\nwhat Kresimir’s Promise is.”\nSouSmith looked impressed. “One man I’d not cross,” he said.\n“Agreed. You have any idea what it means?”\nSouSmith returned to cleaning himself up. “Our leader was a royal\ncabal washout.” SouSmith opened the desk drawer. He removed a grimy\nold pipe and a tobacco pouch. SouSmith lit up his pipe before he went on.\n“A loudmouth. A jackass. Wanted attention. Said our name was supposed\nto remind the royal cabal of their mortality.”\nIt was the longest sentence Adamat had heard SouSmith utter in years.\n“Did he tell you what it meant?”\n“Break Kresimir’s Promise,” SouSmith said, puffing on his pipe. The\nsmell of pistachio-flavored tobacco filled the tiny room. “And end the\nworld.”\n“What’s the promise?” Adamat asked.\nSouSmith shrugged.\nAdamat tapped the side of his jaw with one finger as SouSmith leaned\nback. He wasn’t going to say any more. Not about this. Adamat let his\nthoughts slip toward Palagyi. The twerp of a banker still had men lurking"

    "text": "back. He wasn’t going to say any more. Not about this. Adamat let his\nthoughts slip toward Palagyi. The twerp of a banker still had men lurking\nabout. He was unpredictable. A man with SouSmith’s size and reputation\ncould keep the idiot in line. At least until Adamat’s loan was due and\nPalagyi had the law on his side. Besides, SouSmith could be very useful in\ntight places—such as the Public Archives, behind the royalist barricades.\n“Any chance you’re in need of a job?” Adamat asked.\nSouSmith examined him through those small eyes. “What kind of a\njob?”\nChapter 9\nTaniel found his father’s command post just out of range of the royalist\nbarricades. The empty streets were full of rubbish, the paving stones damp\nfrom a brief rain the night before. The city smells threatened to overcome\nhis senses, enhanced from the near-constant powder trance he’d been in for\ntwo weeks. The world smelled of shit and fear, of empty piss pots and\ndistrust.\nKa poel was at his side. Even after all this, she was still mystified by the\n‑\nsight of the city—so many buildings, each one so tall on every side. She\ndidn’t like it. Too many people, she had indicated with a series of gestures.\nToo many buildings. Taniel sympathized. His real talent as a powder mage\nwas being able to float a bullet for miles—to make long shots across the\nwidest battlefield. What good was that when his view was obstructed on all\nsides?\nGothen stood on Taniel’s other side. The magebreaker scratched the\nback of his head where he still had hair. He watched the barricades with a\nhand on the grip of one of his three pistols.\n“Coming in with me?” Taniel asked.\nGothen shook his head. “Your father makes me nervous.”\n“You’re not the only one,” Taniel muttered.\nTamas had set up his headquarters in one of the hundreds of abandoned\nhomes near the center of the city. Soldiers milled about outside. They didn’t\nwear the familiar dark blue of Adran infantry. Their uniforms were red and\ngold and white, their standard a saint’s halo with gold wings. These were\nthe Wings of Adom. The majority of them were Adran, as it was an Adran-\nbased mercenary company, but one could see all kinds in their ranks. Taniel\ncrossed the street and paused just long enough for one of the guards to get a\nlook at his powder keg pin before heading inside, Ka poel on his heels.\n‑\nThe salon of the house had the look of a command tent. There were\nmaps on every available surface, gear stacked in the corners, even rifles and\nammunition crates. Tamas stood behind a table, examining a map of the\ncity while two of the Wings’ brigadiers—brigade commanders—stood off\nto one side. Tamas’s bodyguard lounged on a sofa in the corner, smoking.\nTamas didn’t look up when Taniel entered. Taniel cleared his throat. No\nresponse. The brigadiers gave him a curious look.\n“I want Bo,” Taniel said.\nTamas finally looked up. He had the tense air of someone whose deep\nthoughts had been interrupted.\n“Bo?”"

He had the tense air of someone whose deep\nthoughts had been interrupted.\n“Bo?”\nTaniel rolled his eyes. “Borbador. I need his help.”\nTamas scowled. “I don’t want a Privileged anywhere near the city right\nnow.”\n“What about that mercenary you saddled me with? Julene?”\n“That’s different,” Tamas said. “Privileged Borbador was a member of\nthe king’s royal cabal.”\n“Exiled,” Taniel said. “And Bo has no love for the late king. He joined\nthe royal cabal for the money and the brothel girls.”\n“And he was exiled because he slept with the royal cabal head’s favorite\nmistress,” Tamas said. He stepped away from the table and sank into a\nchair. He rubbed his eyes, as if trying to will away exhaustion. “They\nalmost reinstated him just a few months ago. I arranged for his transfer to\nthe Mountainwatch so that when I slaughtered the royal cabal, he wouldn’t\nbe there. I do pay attention to these things.”\nTaniel felt a flicker of gratitude and hated himself for it.\nTamas changed the subject. “How goes the hunt?”\nTaniel remained standing to give his report, even when his father\ngestured to a chair. “The Westeven townhouse has been abandoned. The\nPrivileged is gone, too. She’s covering her tracks well, and Ka poel’s\n‑\nmethods, though accurate, aren’t fast enough to keep up with someone on\nthe move.”\n“Julene should be able to track her.”\n“Julene is more trouble than she’s worth.”\nTamas sat up straight. “Julene’s well worth the money I pay her. She’s\ntaken care of problems for me in the past. She’s discreet and measured.”\n“Problems, eh?” Taniel said. “Like those three Adran Privileged last\nyear that disappeared? That was in the newspapers in Fatrasta. They were\ngetting too vocal in their opposition to your powder cabal, if I remember\nright.”\n“Yes,” Tamas said.\n“And you trust her?”\n“As long as I keep paying her.”\n“Tamas, she’s a powder keg with a short fuse. She went after the\nPrivileged—she and her magebreaker, alone, against my orders. She’s\neither got a death wish or there’s something personal in all of this.”\n“When did I put you in command?” Tamas stood up, crossed to his\ndesk, and poured himself a glass of water.\nTaniel stiffened. “That was the implication when you paired me with\nthose two. I am a Marked.”\n“Hmm.” Tamas swirled the water in his glass. “Let that Privileged slip\nthrough your fingers again and I will put Julene in charge. She’s efficient—\nbrutal when she needs to be, but efficient.”\n“Do that and you’ll explain to your council why half the city was\ndestroyed in a full-on melee between two Privileged.” Taniel couldn’t keep\nthe venom out of his voice. Was Tamas being willfully stupid?\n“I’ll give you one more chance,” Tamas said.\nTaniel ground his teeth together. “You don’t trust me to do my job?"

What will it take for you to put any faith in me? Fifty\nPrivileged notches on my rifle stock? A hundred?”\n“I know what you’re capable of, but you’re still young. You have a hot\ntemper.”\n“And you have room to speak?”\n“Watch your mouth. You’re going to follow orders or I’ll put someone\nelse on this. Vlora would jump at the chance to get back into my good\ngraces right now.”\n“I can do this.” Taniel spoke between clenched teeth.\n“Then prove it. Listen to Julene’s advice. She’s a veteran Privileged\nhunter and a skilled sorceress herself.”\nTaniel snorted. “Kresimir above, it’s like you slept with the woman.”\nThere was a brief pause, a flicker of danger in Tamas’s eyes. Taniel felt the\ngrin sprout on his face. He threw his head back and laughed. “You did! You\nbedded the mercenary!”\n“That’s enough, soldier.” That came from Tamas’s new bodyguard. The\nman sat on the sofa, watching them both through a swirl of cigarette smoke.\nTaniel glanced at him once, then back at his father. He could see the veins\nstanding out on Tamas’s neck. Tamas’s fists were clenched, his teeth\ngrinding together. Taniel felt his pride warring with the sudden sense of\ndanger in the room. The two brigadiers had their heads together over a map\nof the Nine, pretending not to hear the conversation between father and son.\nTaniel cleared his throat. “Julene can’t track her. She admitted so\nherself. The Privileged is spreading auras using the rain. I’ve tried my third\neye and gotten nowhere. Our only chance is Ka poel and she’s moving\n‑\nslow. Even then, once we catch her—well, this woman is powerful. Not just\nmagically. I’ve shot her three times. I put my bayonet through her stomach\nand she destroyed two buildings and disappeared. She’s still on the move\nafter a wound that should have killed her. That’s why I want Bo.”\nTamas seemed to gain control of himself. “Absolutely not. I will not\nrisk a cabal Privileged in the city. Maybe in a few months. You’ll have to\nmake do with the help you have. Ryze,” he said to the older of the two\nbrigadiers in the corner, a veteran with a patch over one eye, “I need a\ncompany at the ready for whenever Taniel needs it. Give him an\nexperienced tracker, too. One that’s good in the city.” The old brigadier\nnodded, and Tamas turned back to Taniel. “Dismissed, soldier.”\nTaniel gave a mock salute and spun around, leaving the room. He\npaused outside the command post to snort another line of powder. The\npowder trance intensified instantly.

Too\nmuch powder.\n“I’m fine.”\nShe shook her head again.\n“What do you know?”\nKa poel glared.\n‑\nTaniel looked away from her. Gothen was still across the street, fiddling\nwith his private armory so that he’d be able to sit down comfortably on a\nstoop.\n“I think one of them is reporting to Tamas,” Taniel said to Ka poel.\n‑\n“Behind my back. Wouldn’t put it past Tamas. He’s never trusted me.” He\nrubbed his nose. “Thinks I’m still a kid.”\nKa poel touched a fist to her heart and pointed at him.\n‑\n“He loves me? Huh. Maybe he does,” Taniel said. “He’s my father, he’s\nsupposed to—and Tamas always does the right thing. It’d just be nice if he\nliked me too.” He jerked his head toward Gothen. “I’ve never much liked\nmercenaries.” He gave a quick glance around to be sure none of the Wings\nof Adom were within earshot and continued. “They don’t work half as hard\nfor the money you’re paying them and in the end they’d rather save their\nown skins than finish a job.”\nKa poel seemed to think on this for a moment. She understood him well\n‑\nenough—when it was convenient for her—but it took her a few moments to\ncatch up when he spoke too quickly.\nShe made the shape of a woman with her hands.\n“Julene?”\nShe nodded and bared her teeth.\n“I don’t like her either. She could have gotten us all killed against that\nPrivileged. Even a Privileged—especially a Privileged—should know you\ndon’t just walk up to one of them and think you’re going to get the drop.\nShe acts like she knows she’s going to win every fight.”\nKa poel pointed a finger at him.\n‑\nTaniel chuckled. “Me? I do know I’m going to win every fight.”\nHe headed across the street and joined Gothen on the stoop.\n“Where’s Julene?” he asked.\nGothen shrugged. “She comes and goes. She won’t be gone more than a\ncouple hours, though, with us on a job.”\n“Have you worked with her long?”\n“Two years.”\n“For Tamas?”\n“A little over a year.”\n“Where were you before that?”\n“Kez.”\n“Hunting powder mages?”\nGothen shifted uncomfortably. “A Warden that went mad. An ex cabal\n‑\nPrivileged. Mostly that kind of thing.”\n“I’d imagine the money is good in Kez.” Taniel decided not to press\nhim on the powder mages.\n“Very,” Gothen said. “Things went bad for us working for a duke,\nthough, and we were forced to get out of the country quick.”\nTaniel made a mental note that Julene might have a grudge against the\nKez. It certainly explained why Tamas liked her. “How does that work\nout?” he asked. “A magebreaker and a Privileged being partners. She can’t\ndo sorcery anywhere close to you.”"

    "text": "Kez. It certainly explained why Tamas liked her. “How does that work\nout?” he asked. “A magebreaker and a Privileged being partners. She can’t\ndo sorcery anywhere close to you.”\nGothen gave a lopsided smile. “Not as bad as you’d think. I have to\ntouch the Else”—he lifted his hands, though he wasn’t wearing his gloves\n—“to truly cut off a Privileged’s sorcery. Even then, I have to be within\nabout ten feet of them.”\n“Which is quite a task in itself,” Taniel said.\n“Yeah.”\nTaniel leaned back. “Magebreakers are very rare. I don’t think my\nfather even knows how you work.”\n“We are quite rare,” Gothen agreed. “I’ve met only one besides myself.\nMagebreakers aren’t born this way, not like Privileged or powder mages or\nKnacked.”\n“Then how?”\n“A conscious decision,” Gothen said. He had a faraway look in his eyes.\n“Simple as that?”\n“Simple as that. I reached out, I touched the Else, and I willed away all\nauras.” He pulled his Privileged gloves out of his pockets and showed them\nto Taniel. They were dark blue with gold runes—not the usual colored\nrunes on white gloves of a Privileged. “My gloves turned this color\ninstantly. A kind of polarizing, as I understand it. Now, when I touch the\nElse, the area around me becomes devoid of sorcery. Auras can’t be\nsummoned, created, or manipulated. Even when I’m not touching the Else,\nauras will not come within about six inches of me.”\n“Can it be reversed? If you wanted to be a Privileged again?”\n“No.” Gothen returned the gloves to his pocket.\nPrivileged were the most powerful beings on earth. They threw\nlightning the way a child might a ball. They commanded the sea and the\nearth. Taniel couldn’t imagine giving up such power.\n“Why?” he asked.\nGothen kicked at a paving stone beneath his boot. “I was a very weak\nPrivileged. Barely strong enough to touch the Else, much less command\nauras. I failed the test to join the royal cabal. I was angry. I thought, if they\nwouldn’t take me off the street and share with me their wealth and power,\nthen I would become what they feared most: untouchable by their sorcery.”\n“I can respect that.”\nGothen returned the grin. “And now I make a lot of money tracking\nthem down and killing them.”\n“Have you killed many?”\nGothen held up five fingers.\nProbably powder mages too, if he worked for the Kez. Gothen didn’t\ncarry an air rifle, but a pistol would work if the powder mage was caught\nunawares. Taniel had heard of bounty hunters who used bullets with gold\ndust melted into them. Gold in a powder mage’s bloodstream prevented a\nMarked from sparking powder or entering a powder trance. Luckily, that\nparticular technique was both expensive and unreliable.\n“How do you feel about the Privileged we’re after?” Taniel asked.\nA cloud touched Gothen’s face. “She’s very strong,” he said. “Stronger\nthan any I’ve tracked. Julene says I’m just imagining it.”"

Julene says I’m just imagining it.”\n“I don’t think so,” Taniel said. “I was there when she wrecked those\nbuildings. Only you standing between us kept me from getting killed. I\nthank you for that.”\nGothen nodded uncertainly. “I think there’s something you should\nknow.”\n“What?”\n“When I leapt in front of you, I was touching the Else. I was easily close\nenough to cut her off. She shouldn’t have been able to reach through. But\nshe did. That’s never happened before.”\nTaniel wiped away a bit of sweat beading on his brow. “You’d better\nwarn your partner not to be too confident.”\n“As if she’ll listen,” Gothen said. “There’s something almost… personal\nin this. As if she doesn’t want your help—pit, as if she doesn’t even want\nmy help.”\nTaniel snorted. “She’s welcome to go it alone.”\n“To go what alone?”\nTaniel started. Julene stood over them, a hand on one hip, a frown\ntugging at the scar on her face. She’d come upon them silently. Only\nKa poel seemed unsurprised by her arrival.\n‑\nThey sat in silence for a moment, Gothen trying to avoid Julene’s glare.\nHe seemed to wither beneath her. Taniel climbed to his feet.\nHe was thrown down again almost instantly as the ground pitched\nbeneath him.\n“Earthquake!” someone shouted.\nTamas was leaning on the edge of his map table when the ground began to\nbuck. He reeled backward, thrown against the wall and then tossed to the\nfloor like he’d been hit by a cavalry charge. Plaster fell from the ceiling,\nobscuring the room in a haze of dust. Tamas clutched at the floor with both\nhands, stomach churning as he watched the table thump from side to side\nuntil a leg broke. It tumbled askew, jumping like a leaf in the wind.\nDecorations fell from shelves and furniture upended. Tamas heard panicked\nshouting out in the streets.\nAs quickly as it began, the earthquake was over. Tamas climbed to his\nfeet, waving a cloud of plaster dust from his face. The room seemed intact,\nthough most of the furniture was dashed to pieces. He breathed a sigh of\nrelief that the whole house hadn’t caved in on them. Many of the buildings\nin this part of the city were old and unreliable, and he imagined plenty of\npeople hadn’t been so lucky.\nOlem had been thrown to the floor and a bookshelf had crashed down\nover him. Tamas’s legs wobbled unsteadily as if he’d been at sea for\nmonths. He crossed to the bookshelf and lifted it up.\nOlem lay on his back, rubbing at his forehead with one hand, using the\nother to clear away the books that had fallen on him. He took Tamas’s\nproffered hand.\n“You’ve blood on you, sir,” Olem said.\nTamas touched his forehead. His fingers came away crimson. “Don’t\neven feel it,” he said.\n“Must have caught a piece of plaster,” Olem said.\nTamas looked up. There were several good-sized holes in the ceiling,"

There were several good-sized holes in the ceiling,\none right above the command table. “Just a bump,” Tamas said. “I’m fine.”\nHe surveyed the room, feeling dizzy. It would take hours to get things\nreturned to order. His maps had been scattered. He swayed.\n“You sure you’re all right, sir?” Olem asked. He put out one hand to\nsteady Tamas.\nTamas waved him away. “Fine, fine. Let’s have a look at the damage\noutside.”\nThe street was in chaos. People emerged from their houses, yelling for\nhelp. Mercenaries tried to right field guns that had been tossed on their\nsides like they weighed nothing. Cobbles had popped from the street as if\nthe ground had flexed beneath them. Whole rows of tightly packed\napartment housing had crumbled, spilling bricks out into the road.\nOne of the Wings of Adom mercenaries paused before Tamas.\n“There’s been an earthquake, sir,” the man said.\n“Thank you, soldier. I gathered as much.”\nThe man rushed off, his eyes looking a little dazed. Tamas exchanged a\nglance with Olem. “We don’t get a lot of earthquakes here,” Tamas said.\nOlem shook his head. “Not in my lifetime.”\nTamas turned around, assessing the damage. There would be parts of\nthe city where things were worse, and parts where they were better. Tamas\ndidn’t even want to think of the chaos this had caused at the docks.\n“Does Sablethorn look like it’s leaning, sir?” Olem asked.\nTamas looked. The black spire, rising over the buildings to the west, did\nindeed look a little off. “At least it didn’t fall outright. Olem.”\n“Sir?”\n“Find some runners. I want damage assessment from the entire city. I\nwant to know about the barricades. If some holes have opened up, it may be\nour chance to punch through them.”\n“Now?”\n“Definitely. General Westeven will take advantage of the chaos to move\nup his barricades and reinforce them with rubble from the quake. We need\nto take advantage as well.”\n“You sure you’re unhurt, sir?”\n“Positive. Go.”\nOlem hurried off. Tamas waited until he was out of sight before he\nsagged against the wall behind him. His head throbbed from where he’d\nbeen hit. He could see figures scurrying over the barricade down the street,\nrushing out beyond them to snatch up bricks and masonry and throwing\nthem back over.\n“Ryze!” Tamas said.\nThe mercenary brigadier picked his way through the rubble to Tamas.\n“Any of those guns operational?” Tamas asked.\n“Axles are bent, wheels broken. We’ll need to call in some smiths to fix\nthem.”\nTamas indicated the barricades. “Pass word among your boys to move\nup within firing distance. Don’t let Westeven reinforce his barricades.”\nRyze snapped a salute and spun off, barking orders to his men.\nTamas went back inside. He found a chair and righted it, and then\nrummaged through the mess until he found a spare coat. He wadded it up"

He sank into the chair.\n“You’ll have a nasty bump on your forehead.”\nA man stood in the doorway, hands on his hips, surveying the damage\nwithin. He had long black hair, pulled back in a braided ponytail that hung\nover one shoulder, and a thin mustache. He was a big man, twenty stone or\nmore, and a head and a half taller than Tamas. His skin had a slight yellow\ntint, hinting at some Rosvelean ancestry, but he spoke with the accent of a\nnative Adran. He wore the brown pants and long, dirty white shirt of a city\nworker underneath a frayed jacket.\n“Yes,” Tamas said, tenderly pressing his fingers to his temple. “I think I\nwill. Are you a surgeon?”\nThe man looked down at his hands, surprised. “No, I think not. These\npudgy hands have only one calling: the kitchens.”\n“A cook?” He sent Olem away for just a minute and now any kind of\nriffraff just wandered in to his command center. “If you need help, I’m sure\nthe soldiers outside are setting up a field hospital.”\nThe man narrowed his eyes. “Cook?” he snapped. “Do I look like a\ncheap purveyor of watery soup and half-cooked meat? I’m a chef, damn it,\nand you watch who you call a cook in the future. Feelings are liable to get\nhurt.”\nTamas lowered his hand from his injured head and stared at the man.\nWho the pit did he think he was? Amusement turned to annoyance as the\nman entered the room and set a chair back on its legs near Tamas, taking a\nseat.\n“Do you know who I am?” Tamas demanded.\nThe man waved a hand, using the other to adjust his big belly\ncomfortably into his lap. “Field Marshal Tamas, unless I’m mistaken.”\nThe gall. “And you are?”\nThe man removed a handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his\nforehead. “It’s bloody hot in here. Where are my manners? I’m Mihali, son\nof Moaka, lord of the Golden Chefs.”\nThe Golden Chefs sounded familiar, but Tamas couldn’t quite put his\nfinger on it.\n“Moaka?” Tamas asked. “The na baron?”\n‑\n“My father preferred to think of himself as a culinary expert above all\nelse, Kresimir rest his soul.”\n“Yes,” Tamas said. He touched his head gingerly. It seemed to have\nstopped bleeding, but his headache was getting worse. “I attended one of\nhis galas once. The food was unparalleled. He passed on last year, didn’t\nhe?” Even the son of a na baron didn’t belong here. Where the blazes was\n‑\nOlem?\n“He always cooked it all himself.” Mihali hung his head. “A pity. His\nheart gave out when he tasted my lamb soufflé. He was so proud of me,\nfinally besting him.” Mihali stared off across the room, exploring\nmemories.\n“Pardon me,” Tamas said.

The pounding inside his head began to\nincrease. “Why the pit are you here?”\n“Oh,” Mihali said. “Many apologies. I’m the god Adom reincarnated.”\nTamas couldn’t help it. He began to chuckle, then to laugh. He slapped\nhis knee. “Saint Adom, eh? That’s a good one. Ow.” He clutched at his\nhead. Laughing had not been a good idea.\n“Saint,” Mihali grumbled. “I give order to chaos alongside Kresimir and\nthese people relegate me to sainthood. Oh well, can’t win them all, can\nyou?”\nTamas managed to stifle his chuckles. “By Kresimir, you’re serious?”\n“Of course,” Mihali said. He put one hand over his heart. “I swear by\nmy mother’s squash soup.”\nTamas stood up. Was this some kind of joke? Was it Sabon? Maybe\nOlem. Olem was far cheekier than he should be. “Olem,” he called. There\nwas no answer. Tamas swore under his breath. He’d told Olem to send\nrunners, not inspect the whole city himself. “Olem!” He stuck his head out\ninto the hallway. There was no one around.\nHe turned about, face-to-face with Mihali. Mihali glanced out the door.\n“I don’t really want to meet anyone yet, thank you,” he said. “I don’t want\nto cause a fuss. Meeting a god is an awfully big thing. I think.”\n“What are you, an actor?” Tamas said. He poked the man in the belly,\nchecking for a stuffed shirt. It was all fat. “A mighty good show, but I’m\nnot in the mood.”\nMihali pointed at Tamas’s forehead. “You were hit quite hard,” he said.\n“I know it’s a lot to take in. Maybe you should sit down for a moment. My\nmemories are imperfect in this body, but I will do my best.” He cleared his\nthroat. “Did the dying Privileged warn you as they were supposed to?”\nTamas froze in the act of feeling his head wound. He grabbed Mihali by\nthe lapels of his jacket. “Warn me about what?”\nMihali looked truly puzzled. He gave an apologetic shrug. “As I said,\nmy memories are not what they should be.” He seemed to perk up. “They\nwill improve over time, though. I think.”\n“No more jokes now,” he said. “Who the pit are you?”\nTamas flew against the doorjamb, hitting his shoulder hard, then was\ntossed to the floor. For a moment he thought Mihali had hit him, but then\nrealized it was another earthquake. His heart in his mouth, he gripped the\ndoorframe, watching more plaster fall to the floor and praying the whole\nbuilding wouldn’t come down this time. It was over in seconds.\nHe climbed up and dusted himself off, searching the room. The man\nwas gone. Tamas gritted his teeth and looked out into the hallway. Olem\nwas there, steadying himself up against the wall.\n“Where the pit have you been?” Tamas asked."

Olem\nwas there, steadying himself up against the wall.\n“Where the pit have you been?” Tamas asked.\n“Finding runners,” Olem said. “Everything good, sir?”\nTamas eyed him suspiciously. Not even a smirk. No one could play a\njoke that well.\n“Fine. You see someone pass by here?”\nOlem glanced at him, looking back and forth down the hallway. He\nreached down into the rubble at his feet and fished out a still-smoking\ncigarette. “No, sir.”\nTamas stepped back into the command post. There was a back door to\nthe house, he was sure, but no one could have crossed the room with the\nground shaking like that.\nHow hard did I hit my head?\nChapter 10\nAdamat stopped by his home for his pistols. Five days since he’d hired\nSouSmith, and the cordon around the center of the city had left no\nopportunities for them to sneak into the Public Archives. That had changed\nwith the quake. The whole city was a mess. Buildings were down, roads\nfilled with the homeless. Adamat had taken the opportunity to scout the\nroyalist positions for a way to get to the Archives. He’d had no such luck.\nThere had been rumors Tamas would bring his entire army into the city\nand push through the barricades, but it seemed he’d turned his soldiers and\nmercenaries alike to helping the citizens rather than taking the barricades.\nOnce the fighting began in earnest, it would be very dangerous in\nCentestershire. Then there was the rumor that Tamas’s powder mages were\nstill hunting a rogue Privileged through the streets of Adopest. Being out\nand about in the city was not for the faint of heart.\nEvery three days, Adamat received a messenger from Tamas. Every\nthree days, he was forced to report he’d made no headway. It was\nfrustrating having the field marshal breathing down his neck and not being\nable to report any kind of success.\nAdamat stooped just inside the front door to pick up the post. At least\nTamas kept that running. It was hard not to admire him for that. Adamat\nwaited for SouSmith to come inside, then pushed the door closed with his\nfoot. SouSmith tapped his shoulder.\nThe back door through the hallway and past the kitchen was ajar. He\ndropped the post on a side table and removed a cane from the holder near\nthe door. SouSmith headed to the sitting room. Adamat came around the\ncorner behind him, cane held high. He lowered it slowly.\n“You saved me a trip,” he said.\nPalagyi sat in Adamat’s favorite chair, next to the fireplace, hands\nfolded in his lap. He had the same two goons with him as last time. The\nlockpick lounged on the sofa, boots on, and the big one with the coal-\nstained arms studied his family portrait above the mantle. A fourth man sat\nbehind Adamat’s desk, hands folded serenely in his lap.\nPalagyi’s eyes grew wide at the sight of SouSmith. “You were coming\nto see me?” he said.\n“Yes, I just was.”\n“I can’t imagine why.

    "text": "to see me?” he said.\n“Yes, I just was.”\n“I can’t imagine why. There’s no way you have the money you owe\nme.” Again, he eyed SouSmith nervously.\nAdamat took a deep breath, gathered his composure. “No, but I have\nsome of it. You said you’d leave me be until my time was up.”\n“And I have,” Palagyi said.\nAdamat looked around the room. “I’ve got well over a month left.”\n“You gave me the wrong address for your family,” Palagyi said.\n“I gave you my cousins’ address,” Adamat said.\n“Your cousins are a family of brawlers?”\n“Seven sons, all take after their father,” Adamat said. “Very successful\nprizefighters.”\n“Yes,” Palagyi said, “Well, that may be, your family wasn’t there.”\n“Really?”\n“And when my boys pressed the question, they were forcibly removed\nfrom the town,” Palagyi said. “In tar and feathers.”\n“I can’t imagine why,” Adamat said. He smiled inwardly but kept his\nexpression flat.\nPalagyi worked to control himself. “I’m willing to let this go.”\nAdamat froze. Palagyi was up to something. “Why?” he said.\nPalagyi examined his fingernails. “I want to introduce you to my new\nfriend,” he said. He gestured to the man sitting at Adamat’s desk. “This is\nLord Vetas. He’s a man of various talents. And he has powerful friends.”\n“Pleased to meet you.” Adamat gave the man a curt nod and a quick\ninspection. He had the dusty, yellow skin of a full-blooded Rosvelean. He\nwore all-black clothes but for a scarlet vest and the gold chain of a pocket\nwatch visible at his breast pocket. He sat in Adamat’s chair like a schoolboy\nwith perfect posture and his eyes traveled around the room with the steady\ninspection of someone who sees everything.\n“You knew about the coup,” Palagyi said, bringing Adamat’s attention\nback to him. “Even before the papers. The night before, you were gone half\nthe night. Summoned somewhere. My man saw you leave. You returned\nand immediately put your family in a carriage to—”\n“Somewhere safe,” Adamat finished.\n“Somewhere safe,” Palagyi continued. “And then you wrote a lot of\nletters. Sent them who knows where? You practically ran up to the\nuniversity, skipping the execution—which seems strange, because not\nanother soul in Adopest did. Since then you’ve been prowling around\nAdopest, hiring carriages to the north and east, writing more letters. You’ve\nbeen to every library in southern Adro.”\n“I see you’ve hired better people to follow me,” Adamat said.\n“Yes, I did.” Palagyi polished his fingernails on his waistcoat.\n“Even so, it took you this long to add things up?”\n“I won’t let you spoil my mood,” Palagyi said. “You’re working for\nTamas. I know you are. And Lord Vetas knows as well. Along with his\nmaster.”\nAdamat studied the man behind his desk. “And who might that be?”\n“Someone with a vested interest in the affairs of Adro and the rest of the"

His voice was quiet,\nmeasured with the enunciation of a man educated at the best schools.\n“A criminal?” Adamat said. “Palagyi rarely deals with people who\naren’t. The Proprietor, perhaps?”\nLord Vetas gave a dry chuckle. “No,” he said.\n“Stop trying to change the subject,” Palagyi snarled. He stood up. “You\nwork for Tamas now, don’t you?”\n“Sit down,” Lord Vetas said. Palagyi sat.\n“And if I do?” Adamat said.\nPalagyi opened his mouth.\n“Quiet,” Lord Vetas said. He spoke the word softly. Palagyi’s mouth\nsnapped shut. “You may go now, Palagyi. You’ve made the introductions.”\nPalagyi glared at Lord Vetas. “Don’t think you’ll take the credit for this\nyourself. I discovered this. I told Lord—”\nThe garrote came up around Palagyi’s throat and snapped tight from\nbehind. Adamat drew his cane sword, SouSmith his pistol. Lord Vetas held\nup a single hand. Adamat froze. He watched in morbid fascination as\nPalagyi struggled against the strong hands of his own goon, the coal worker\nwith the quick reflexes. Palagyi’s face turned purple, and the goon kept his\ngarrote tight around Palagyi’s throat until long after the life was gone from\nhim. Adamat lowered his cane sword.\nLord Vetas folded his hands back into his lap. “I’ve just taken over your\nloan from the late Palagyi. It’s in your interest to work for me now.”\n“Doing what?” Adamat’s mind raced. Palagyi had been a predictable\nthug. Adamat could deal with him. This Lord Vetas, however… he was a\ndangerous man. Dangerous like the Proprietor: the kind that made\npolicemen retire early.\n“I want to know everything about Tamas. Everything he does,\neverything he says to you. What he has you looking for.”\n“My loyalties are not for sale,” Adamat said.\n“You’ll have to change your loyalties, then.”\n“I don’t know who you are, or who your master is,” Adamat said. “I’m\nloyal to Adro and I will not change that.”\n“My master has the Nine’s best interests at heart, I assure you,” Lord\nVetas said. His quiet, sibilant voice was beginning to irritate Adamat. He\nalmost had to strain to hear the man.\nAdamat said, “The Nine is not the same as Adro. For all I know, you\nwork for the Kez. The newspaper says they’re sending ambassadors and\nthat they still want Tamas to sign the Accords.”\n“I don’t work for the Kez.”\n“Then who?”\n“That is of little consequence to you.”\n“You aren’t endearing yourself,” Adamat said. “You come into my\nhome, kill a man in my very living room, and threaten me? How do you\nknow I won’t send for the police this instant?”"

How do you\nknow I won’t send for the police this instant?”\nA shallow smile flitted across Lord Vetas’s face. “I am not the sort of\nman one summons the police on,” he warned. “You of all people should\nknow that.”\n“Yes. I’d already realized that.” Adamat gritted his teeth. “You’re the\ntype of man who gives face to evil.”\nLord Vetas seemed taken aback. “Evil? No, good sir. Just pragmatism.”\n“I know your kind,” Adamat said. “And you seem to know me. Or you\nthink you do. Now, get out of my home.”\nHe glanced at SouSmith. Palagyi had been strangled by his own man.\nWould the same thing happen to Adamat? Was SouSmith really a friend?\nThe boxer looked troubled. He watched both the goons and Lord Vetas all\nat once and cracked his knuckles like he did when he was ready for a fight.\n“I will pay you your money,” Adamat said, “if you have indeed taken over\nthe loan. Or I will face the streets when you kick me out. I will not betray a\nclient or my country.”\nLord Vetas examined his hands thoughtfully. He stood up and took his\nhat off the desk. “I’ll return when I have leverage.” The statement was\nmatter of fact, yet the word “leverage” sent a chill down Adamat’s spine.\n‑ ‑\n“Meanwhile, as a show of my master’s good faith, we’ll suspend your\nloan.” He passed by Adamat and tipped his hat. “Consider our employment\noffer.” He gave Adamat a small card with an address printed on the back.\nIt was not until Lord Vetas and his thugs were gone that Adamat\nremembered the body in his favorite chair. He regarded SouSmith grimly.\n“Find us some lunch in the pantry. I’m going to figure out something to do\nwith that.”\n“Jakob has a great attachment to you,” the woman said.\nNila sat across from the woman at a cafe table and sipped from a warm\ncup of tea. The sun shone overhead, a stiff breeze moving through the\nstreets, and she could almost forget about the barricades just around the\nother side of the building, where royalist partisans held a wary standoff with\nTamas’s more numerous and better-trained soldiers.\n“I can’t stay,” Nila said.\nThe woman examined her over a cup of tea. Her name was Rozalia and\nshe was a Privileged. The Hielmen said she was the last Privileged left in all\nof Adro, but no one knew where she’d come from. She wasn’t a member of\nManhouch’s royal cabal. Why she had any interest in Nila was impossible\nto say. Nila had no idea how to act in the presence of a Privileged. It was\nimpossible to curtsy sitting down. She kept her eyes on her tea and tried to\nbe as polite as possible.\n“Why not, child?”\nNila sat up straighter. She didn’t consider herself a child.

She could wash and press and mend clothes and she\nmight have one day married Yewen, the butler’s son, if the whole world\nhadn’t gone to the pit with Tamas’s coup. Yewen was gone now, maybe\nfled, maybe killed in the streets.\nWhen Nila didn’t answer, Rozalia went on. “We have a parley with\nField Marshal Tamas in the morning. If he comes to his senses, if General\nWesteven can make him see reason, you may find yourself nursemaid to the\nnew king of Adro.”\n“I’m not a nurse,” Nila said. “I wash clothes.”\n“That doesn’t have to define you, child. I’ve been many things in my\nlife. A Privileged is neither the greatest nor the least of them.”\nWhat was greater than a Privileged? “I’m sorry,” Nila said.\nRozalia gave a sigh. “Speak up, child. Look me in the eye. You aren’t a\nduke’s washerwoman anymore.”\n“I’m lowborn, ma’am… my lady.” Nila tried to remember how to\naddress a Privileged. She’d never even met one before today.\n“You’ve saved the life of the closest heir to the throne,” Rozalia said.\n“Baronies have been gifted to the common folk for less.”\nNila swallowed and tried not to imagine herself baroness of some\nbarony in northern Adro. This kind of thing didn’t happen to her. She could\nfeel the Privileged’s eyes studying her.\n“You think we’re going to lose,” Rozalia said. She waited a moment for\nNila’s response, and then somewhat impatiently added, “Speak up, you can\ntalk to me.”\nNila did look up then. “Field Marshal Tamas has every advantage,” she\nsaid. “He won’t execute half the nobility only to put Jakob on the throne.\nWithin a few weeks he’ll have torn down the barricades and sent Jakob and\nall the nobles that backed him to the guillotine. I would like to be gone\nbefore that happens. I don’t want to see it.” She wondered, not for the first\ntime, if it had been a mistake to bring Jakob to General Westeven. She\ncould have fled with him to Kez. The silver she took from the townhouse\nwould have more than paid for the trip.\n“Smart girl,” Rozalia said, placing a finger on her chin.\nNila folded her arms across her chest.\n“What will you do?” Rozalia asked. “Once you’ve gotten past Tamas’s\nblockade and made your way out of the city?”\nWhat interest could a Privileged possibly have in that? Nila realized that\nshe didn’t know what she’d do. She had the silver. Most of it, anyway. She\nhad needed new clothes and some medicine for Jakob, and a place to hide\nduring the riots. “I can join up with the army. They always need\nlaundresses, and the pay is good,” she said.\n“At best you’ll wind up a soldier’s wife,” Rozalia said. “What a waste.”\n“It’s better that,” Nila said quietly, “than to die here for a lost cause.”"

You have\ncourage, child, and don’t try to pretend that you don’t love that little boy. If\nyou cared only for yourself, you’d be halfway to Brudania by now.\n“Stay here,” Rozalia continued. “Watch over Jakob. If the parley\ntomorrow goes well, you’ll wind up a rich woman. If it doesn’t… you may\nneed to save his life again.”\nIf she stayed by Jakob’s side, she could, like Rozalia said, become a\nwealthy woman. Or follow him to the guillotine block. She remembered the\nsoldier’s hands holding her down, the feelings of helplessness and horror.\nNo bearded sergeant would save her the next time Tamas’s soldiers came\nthrough a door. She had silver buried in the corner of a graveyard just\noutside of the city. She would never have to feel that fear again.\nNila couldn’t help but wonder if Rozalia had other motives for wanting\nher to stay. A Privileged used the common folk. She didn’t help them.\nThere had to be a reason she was showing such interest in Nila.\nJakob came into sight over Rozalia’s shoulder. His pallor had improved\ndespite the stress of the last two weeks. Rozalia had done something for his\ncough. He smiled and waved to Nila, then was distracted by a butterfly\nflitting through the rubble of a building knocked over by the earthquake.\nShe watched him dance off after the insect, followed by a pair of vigilant\nHielmen.\n“I’ll stay,” she said. “For now.”\n“You can end this quickly,” Julene said.\nTamas examined the woman lounging in the chair on the other side of\nhis desk. She’d come alone on her own initiative, leaving Taniel and the\nmagebreaker who knew where. She wore a low-cut shirt that revealed\nenough cleavage to get the imagination going but that was tight enough for\nher to move quickly when she wanted. Tamas knew the effect was not\naccidental. Yet he was not a man to make the same mistake twice. Julene\nwas a dangerous woman. She was the type to use any weapon available to\nher in order to get ahead. He looked away from her chest and at the scar\nrunning from the corner of her mouth to her brow.\nHe wondered at that scar. There were Privileged who dealt in healing\nsorcery. It was a tricky art, and they were rare, but with the amount Julene\ncharged for her mercenary services, she could easily afford it. Perhaps she\njust liked looking deadly.\n“How?”\n“Assassins,” she said. “Send men behind the barricades. Wipe out all\ntheir leadership and the rest will surrender easily.”\nTamas snorted. “I’ve been trying my best to scrape together\nManhouch’s old spy network with little success and you want me to find\nenough assassins to bring down those barricades? You’re mad.”\n“Use the Black Street Barbers,” Julene said.\n“The street gang?”"

You’re mad.”\n“Use the Black Street Barbers,” Julene said.\n“The street gang?”\nJulene nodded. “They will be expensive, but they’re the best at what\nthey do. They’ll end this civil war.”\n“Gangs can’t be controlled.”\n“They can with the right amount of money,” Julene said. “The Barbers\nare different. More organized. They report to Ricard Tumblar. He uses them\nto police the docks.”\n“Assassination is risky. It could turn the people against me.”\n“You’re being a fool.”\n“Careful.”\n“If you won’t consider that, then you need me at the parley.”\n“Why?” Tamas checked his watch. The parley was set for ten o’clock.\nTwo hours from now.\n“Because General Westeven is in league with this Privileged we’re\nhunting. She’ll be there. It wouldn’t surprise me if she makes a move\nagainst you.”\n“I have my powder mages for that,” Tamas said.\n“Your boy has shot her three times and put an arm’s length of steel\nthrough her stomach. Do your other Marked have anything new to bring to\nthe table?”\nThis confirmed Taniel’s reports. This Privileged was something else.\nSomething more.\n“You know her, don’t you?” he said. “This is personal. I can tell by the\nway you talk. You want this woman dead.”\n“Don’t be absurd.”\n“I’ve had you kill seven Privileged in the last two years. Each time\nyou’ve been cold, mechanical.”\n“And each time I’ve been able to kill them within a day or two,” Julene\nsaid. “This is getting personal. I want the bitch dead.”\n“So you don’t know her?”\n“Of course not.”\nShe was lying. Tamas could tell by the way her eyes hardened when she\nspoke. It was a small tell, and he’d only recently figured it out, but Julene\nput a little extra fire into her lies when she wanted to be believed. Now,\nwhy wouldn’t she tell the truth?\n“You think you can handle her if she tries something?” Tamas said.\n“Of course. Every time we’ve begun to fight, she’s run. At the very\nleast I will scare her off.”\n“Be there,” Tamas said. “In an hour. Bring Gothen and Taniel and his\npet savage. And don’t do anything stupid.”\n“I’ll only be there to protect you,” Julene said.\nTamas stood next to a repaired field gun and watched a line of men make\ntheir way over the barricade under a white flag. Olem was on the other side\nof the gun, leaning against the barrel, speaking quietly to Sabon. Vlora\nstood somewhere behind him with Brigadiers Ryze and Sabastenien, the\nonly two mercenary commanders posted in the city. From a building across\nthe street Taniel trained his rifle on the barricades. Julene tugged idly at her\ngloves, her magebreaker partner beside her. A whole company of Adran\nsoldiers stood at attention twenty paces back. Tamas wanted General\nWesteven to know exactly how bad his odds were.\nThis would be a crucial meeting.

    "text": "soldiers stood at attention twenty paces back. Tamas wanted General\nWesteven to know exactly how bad his odds were.\nThis would be a crucial meeting. Tamas felt he held most of the cards,\nbut General Westeven was an incredibly capable commander. He could ruin\nTamas’s plans simply by protracting the civil war.\n“A sorry lot, sir,” Olem said, motioning toward the approaching\nroyalists.\nTamas withheld judgment. The royalists had been crouching behind\ntheir barricades for eight days. They were dirty and disheveled, but they\nshowed no signs of imminent starvation or even fatigue. Behind ramshackle\nbarricades they may be, but General Westeven would see that every man\nand woman at his disposal slept on a good bed and had plenty to eat—not\nhard, when they had captured the city’s main granaries. The royalists were\neating better than most of the city right now.\nTamas floated in a light powder trance, allowing him to examine faces\nat a distance with ease. He knew General Westeven, a tall, bald man with\nbloodspots on his scalp. Age had reduced the general to little more than\nskin stretched over bones, his whole body moving slowly from advanced\nrheumatism. Still, that was no reason to underestimate him. His mind was\nsharp as a fine dagger.\nTamas didn’t recognize a single one of the men with the general. They\nwere nobles, judging by their bedraggled finery. Men who’d slipped\nthrough his soldiers’ nets the night of the coup, or were too minor to\nwarrant attention.\nHe did recognize the woman with them. It was the Privileged who’d\nkilled Lajos and the rest. She looked none the worse for the wear despite the\nwounds Taniel had supposedly given her. Perhaps Taniel was wrong.\nMaybe he’d missed. Tamas locked eyes with her for a moment. She\nreturned his gaze unflinchingly.\nTaniel wasn’t known to miss.\nThere was a pause among the royalist group and a brief argument before\nthey finished their trek down the street and formed up opposite Tamas and\nhis mercenaries. There were twenty of them, and Westeven was the only\nsoldier of the whole lot. This wasn’t opposition, Tamas realized with\ndisgust. This was a committee.\n“Field Marshal Tamas,” said a fat noble with a stained cummerbund.\n“Order your men to stand down! We’ve come beneath a flag of truce.”\nTamas glanced at the soldiers behind him. They were at attention, their\nrifles shouldered. “Westie,” he said. “Good to see you.”\nWesteven returned his nod. “Would it were under different\ncircumstances, my friend.”\n“There’d be no hard feelings if you stepped away from this lot right\nnow. You’d be a formidable ally in rebuilding the country.”\n“The way I see it,” Westeven said, “is that you are the one destroying\nit.”\n“Surely you can see the corruption?” Tamas said. “Nothing short of the\ndestruction of the nobility would have saved Adro.”\nWesteven’s eyes were tired, his face strained. He seemed as if he\ndesperately wanted to say yes. “There is more at stake here than you know.\nAnd you killed my king, Tamas. I can’t forgive you for that.”"

I can’t forgive you for that.”\n“Your king was about to give the whole country to the Kez!” Tamas’s\nvoice rose sharply. Westeven was a smart man. No, a brilliant man. How\ncould he not see what Tamas was trying to do? How could he stand in the\nway? “I could not allow the Accords to be signed and this country sold into\nservitude. What more important is at stake than the people?”\nThe general glanced at the members of Tamas’s guard. “I won’t speak\nof it here.” His eyes hardened. “We’re here to negotiate,” he said.\n“From what grounds,” Tamas asked. “You’re completely surrounded. I\nhave more men—”\n“I have twenty thousand behind those barricades.”\n“—including women and children, maybe,” Tamas snapped. “You\nmight have a few dangerous Knacked at best, and this.” He gestured to the\nPrivileged. “Yet I have a dozen powder mages and enough field guns to\ndestroy half the city.”\n“You mean the half that wasn’t destroyed by the quake?” Westeven’s\ncalm was infuriating. Tamas gritted his teeth.\n“I have time,” Westeven continued. “I hold the main city granaries and\narmory—food and weapons you need, because the Kez ambassadors will\narrive any day now, and if they see that we are at war among ourselves,\nthen they will smell blood, and a Kez army will be knocking on our door\nwithin weeks. Even if they don’t, the people will begin to tire of this civil\nwar. They will see your soldiers and mercenaries as a burden. They will\nturn on you when you can’t feed them, when you can’t rebuild their city.”\nThe bastard could read his problems like a book. Tamas sized up the\ncollection of noblemen. “What do you propose?”\nThe man with the soiled cummerbund stepped forward. “I am Viscount\nMaxil,” he said. He lifted a length of paper and looked it over. “We have a\nlist of demands.”\nTamas snatched the paper before Maxil could object. He ran his eyes\ndown the list.\n“You expect me to step down? To arrest myself?” He gave the nobles a\nlook of disbelief.\n“You committed high treason!” one of them said. “You killed our king!”\nTamas stared them down until another man said quietly, “We’re willing\nto negotiate on that point.”\nTamas went back to reading. Before he’d gone another paragraph, he was\nshaking his head. “You want all the king’s land and that of the executed\nnobility divided up among yourselves? What do you take me for, a fool?”\n“These are points of negotiation,” Maxil said.\n“A moment ago you said they were demands.”\n“More like negotiation,” Maxil said, looking away.\nTamas gave the list back. “Westie, surely you can talk some sense into\nthem?”\nWesteven shrugged. “Negotiate, Tamas. I beg of you.”\n“Give me a moment.”\nTamas stepped back behind the cannons and beckoned over the\nbrigadiers. He was joined by Olem, Vlora, Sabon, Brigadier Ryze, and"

    "text": "“Give me a moment.”\nTamas stepped back behind the cannons and beckoned over the\nbrigadiers. He was joined by Olem, Vlora, Sabon, Brigadier Ryze, and\nBrigadier Sabastenien. Julene still stood off to the side, staring at the other\nPrivileged with the intensity of a cat.\nBrigadier Sabastenien spoke first. “They have no grounds to negotiate\nfrom.” The man was young, barely older than Taniel, and Tamas had a hard\ntime taking him seriously. Yet one did not become a brigadier of the Wings\nof Adom at that age for nothing.\n“I’m afraid they do,” Sabon said. “Westeven is right. We don’t have\ntime. If the Kez ambassadors arrive and see us in this state…”\n“Not to mention the granaries,” Tamas said. “We’ve reduced rations by\na third for the army just to have a bare minimum for the city breadwagons.\nThe people are starving. They won’t put up with this for long.”\n“Your council will be angry if you make any decisions without them,”\nVlora pointed out. “Sir,” she added.\n“This is a matter of war, Captain,” Tamas said, “and in that they have\ngiven me full power. I’ll negotiate as I see fit.” He turned to Ryze. “Can we\ntake those barricades without losing a few thousand men?”\nRyze considered a moment. “Only if we give them a good shelling first.\nEven then… it will be costly.”\nTamas rolled his eyes. Ryze had been an artillery commander before\njoining the Wings of Adom. He saw shelling as a solution to everything.\n“If we don’t shell them?”\n“It will be a bloodbath,” Ryze said. “On both sides.”\n“Shit.”\nTamas returned to the royalists. “Give me an offer,” Tamas said. He\nmotioned to the paper in Maxil’s hand. “A serious offer. Not that list of pig\nshit. And it will include her”—he pointed at the Privileged—“giving herself\nup to await execution for the murder of my men.”\nThe Privileged gazed back at Tamas with the severity only old women\nare capable of. To her, they were all children playing at children’s games.\n“That won’t happen,” General Westeven said. “Be realistic, Tamas.\nThis is war. Casualties are a fact of that war.”\nTamas gritted his teeth. “Give me an offer.”\nMaxil launched into it immediately, and Tamas realized it was what\nhe’d expected all along.\n“We have a cousin of the king’s within our barricades,” Maxil said.\n“His name?” Tamas interrupted.\n“Jakob the Just.”\nTamas blinked, trying to remember the royal line. “More like Jakob the\nChild, he’s a fourth cousin, at best, and he’s barely five.”\n“He’s the closest living relative to Manhouch.” Maxil went on. “We\npropose that we put him on the throne as Manhouch the Thirteenth. You\nand General Westeven will remain in control of the army, and we along\nwith your council will combine to form the core of the king’s new advisory\nboard. Your powder mages will be the new royal cabal.”"

Your powder mages will be the new royal cabal.”\n“And the king?” Tamas asked.\n“We will advise him until he comes of age.”\nTamas looked to Westeven. There was a levelheadedness to this\nproposal that spoke of his influence. The nobility would leave most of the\ncontrol in his hands. Yet it could not stand.\n“I will never allow a king to have power over Adro again,” Tamas said.\n“I simply won’t have it. If you want a king, he will be that in name only.”\nMaxil scowled. “A puppet monarchy?”\n“At the very best, and I’m stretching my patience to offer that.”\n“No,” Maxil said. “Adro must have a proper king.”\n“Never again,” Tamas said.\n“You’re refusing us? That’s it? No negotiation? We’ve left the army in\nyour hands. We’ve made you the next royal cabal head. You’d be the\nsecond most powerful man in Adro. Are you that greedy that you must keep\nit all to yourself?”\nTamas chuckled. “You poor sods. I didn’t do this for power. I did it to\ndestroy the monarchy. I did it to free the people. I’m not going to turn\naround and put a boy king on the throne so that you can go back to your\ncountry villas and continue to bleed the country dry.” He looked at\nWesteven. “I’m sorry, my friend. No king, no foreign country must ever\nhave power in Adro again.”\n“I will fight you to the end,” Westeven said.\nTamas bowed to his old friend. “I know.” Tamas felt someone touch his\nshoulder. Julene was there, her face serious.\n“There’s something wrong,” she said.\n“What?” Tamas said. He exchanged a frown with General Westeven.\nThe familiar popping sound of fired air rifles erupted from the\nbarricades. Julene leapt between Tamas and General Westeven, shoving\nTamas back. Bullets crackled against an invisible barricade. Julene fell\nback, throwing fireballs as quickly as she could summon them. They\nsmashed into the barricade, causing blooms of fire.\nThe other Privileged launched herself into action just a moment after\nJulene. Hardened shields of air stopped the crack of bullets from Tamas’s\nquickest soldiers, covering the sudden retreat of the royalist delegation. The\nground rumbled, the air seemed to shake, and the cannon closest to Tamas\nsuddenly cracked, the wheels falling off, the broken metal hitting the\nground with a thud.\nTamas leapt to his feet. They’d attacked him. They’d attacked him\nunder a flag of truce! Westeven knew better than that. Westeven… Tamas’s\neyes found his old friend. Westeven’s body was being dragged toward the\nbarricades. He was missing an arm, his whole chest blackened. Was he\nalready dead? He’d been hit by one of Julene’s fireballs. Tamas felt sick.\n“Senseless,” he spat. “Brigadier Ryze! Prime the artillery. We attack at\nonce!”\nChapter 11\nThe Public Archives are just above us,” Adamat said. Somewhere behind"

Somewhere behind\nhim, SouSmith’s lantern wobbled to a stop, and the sound of sloshing\nstilled.\n“You sure this time?”\nAdamat held his own lantern up to the rusted iron ladder rungs in front\nof him. There was a plaque on the bricks between the rungs, supposedly to\nsay which building this accessed, but the letters had been worn away long\nago. The storm drains beneath Adro were not kept in the best of shape. It\nwas a miracle most of them had survived the earthquake—and a testament\nto Adran engineering.\n“I may have a perfect memory,” Adamat said, his voice echoing in the\nlong, shoulder-height tunnel, “but all these damned drains look alike.”\n“Heh. I liked the women’s bathhouse.”\n“I bet you did,” Adamat said. “Wonder anyone’s using it, what with\nTamas lobbing shells all over this section of town.” He rubbed his finger\nover the plaque, trying to make out any kind of letters. “This has got to be\nit.”\nSouSmith sloshed up beside him. The big boxer was bent almost\ndouble. Adamat’s knees and thighs ached from trying to move around in the\nstorm drains, but SouSmith had to be hurting far worse.\n“I’ll check,” SouSmith said. He handed Adamat his lantern and pulled\nhimself up the iron rungs. The ladder squeaked in protest of his weight.\n“Lantern,” SouSmith said, reaching down a hand.\nAdamat heard a grate move to one side, and SouSmith disappeared.\nSomewhere above them, closer than Adamat would have liked, he heard the\ndeep thump of artillery.\n“Come,” SouSmith said, his voice muffled.\nAdamat followed him up the ladder and found himself in a high-arched\nbasement. The walls were made of cement, damp and moldy, and a half\ninch of stagnant water covered the floor. No one had been in this room for a\ndecade.\n“This is it,” Adamat said.\n“Really?” SouSmith looked doubtful.\n“I used to play in these drains as a boy,” Adamat said. “Mother’d get\nfurious. I must have explored half the basements in Adro.” He grinned at\nSouSmith. “I knew we were close when we found the bathhouse.”\n“Spent a lot of time under there, eh?”\n“For certain. I was once an adolescent boy, after all.”\nThey passed through a series of identical arched storage rooms before\nthey found a narrow flight of stairs leading up. The door rattled when\nAdamat tried it.\n“SouSmith,” he said. He stepped back, letting the boxer squeeze past\nhim. SouSmith braced his hands on either wall and kicked the door. The\nlock snapped and the door crashed inward, then fell off its hinges. They\nglanced at each other as the sound echoed through the building.\nThey left their lanterns beside the basement door and carried on\ncautiously. Adamat had his cane, SouSmith a pair of short-barreled pistols.\nThey came out of a long corridor into the main floor of the Archives.\nThe building was as large as a parade ground and stacked four stories"

    "text": "They came out of a long corridor into the main floor of the Archives.\nThe building was as large as a parade ground and stacked four stories\nhigh. Shelving stretched from one wall to the next. Adamat headed down an\naisle. Outside the brick walls, he could hear the sound of rifle and musket\nshots. The air was dusty, the smell of the books almost overwhelming—the\nscent of glue, paper, and old vellum, of age and mustiness.\n“No one here,” SouSmith said.\nAdamat glanced back. SouSmith was inspecting the shelves of books\nwith something akin to suspicion. When a man solved his problems by\npunching them, books were often a foreign thing. “Not surprised,” Adamat\nsaid. “General Westeven has given large grants to at least a dozen libraries\nthroughout the Nine, including this one. He won’t let it be touched.”\nThey came out of an aisle and found themselves in the middle of the\nlibrary. A wide space, free of shelves, was filled with tables for the patrons.\nLight came from a skylight that went up all four stories directly through the\ncenter of the Archives. The tables were all clear.\nExcept for one. Adamat placed a finger to his lips and signaled for\nSouSmith to follow. A number of books had been laid out on a table in one\ncorner. They were open, as if left there only moments ago. His frown\ndeepened as they approached. The books were obviously missing pages,\nand whole paragraphs had been blotted from them. He flipped one of the\nbooks to the cover. In Service of the King.\nAdamat drew his cane sword in one swift motion and spun around. He\nheard the click of SouSmith’s pistols.\nA woman had stepped out between them. She wore a wool riding dress\nand jacket and had gray in her shoulder-length hair, and wise, dark eyes that\nreminded Adamat of a raven. She wore Privileged’s gloves and had a hand\npointed at both himself and SouSmith. An artillery blast made the building\ntremble, kicking up dust from the shelves of books.\nAdamat licked his lips. SouSmith’s eyes were wide, and his finger\nbrushed at the trigger.\n“You’ll get us both killed,” Adamat said to SouSmith.\n“Don’t like this,” was the response.\n“Neither do I. Who are you?” he asked the Privileged, though he\nalready had some idea.\n“My name is Rozalia,” she said.\n“You’re the Privileged that Tamas is hunting.”\nHer silence was enough of an answer for Adamat. His eyes darted to the\nbooks on the table.\n“Are you going to kill us?”\n“Only if I have to.”\nAdamat slowly lowered his cane sword. He gestured to SouSmith to put\naway his pistols.\n“You’re a Knacked,” Rozalia said.\n“Yes.”\n“Are you looking for me?”\n“No.”\nThe Privileged looked confused. “Then why are you here?”\nAdamat jerked his head toward the books. The Privileged still hadn’t\nlowered her gloved hands. It was making him nervous. He said, “Have you\nbeen removing those pages? Blotting those books? And taking the ones at\nthe university?”\nRozalia slowly lowered her hands. “No,” she said.\n“You didn’t take the books at the university?”"

And taking the ones at\nthe university?”\nRozalia slowly lowered her hands. “No,” she said.\n“You didn’t take the books at the university?”\n“I did take those. But I never ripped the pages out. She did.”\n“Who?”\nThe Privileged did not answer.\n“What are you doing with the ones you took?”\n“The same as you, it seems,” she said. “Looking for answers.”\n“Kresimir’s Promise,” Adamat breathed.\nRozalia scoffed. “Simple things,” she said. “There are more questions\nthan you know.”\n“All I care about is Kresimir’s Promise,” Adamat said. “What is it?”\nShe tilted her head to one side and regarded Adamat as a cat would a\nmouse. The sharp crack of rifles filled the silence, and a canon roared\noutside.\n“I need a message delivered,” she said.\n“What?”\n“A message. One that needs to be delivered in person.”\n“I’ll deliver your damned message. Tell me what the Promise is. Give\nme evidence.”\n“I don’t trust you,” Rozalia said. “If you deliver my message, then I will\ntell you.” Her eyes darted suddenly as the thump of rifle butts on a door\nreached them. The Privileged made a hissing sound in the back of her\nthroat. “Field Marshal Tamas is here. I must go. You won’t find the answer\nin any of these books. Only from me.”\nAdamat calculated the chance he’d have of catching her unawares. A\nsignal to SouSmith, a blow to the back of the head. They could hand her\nover to Tamas and let him get the answer out of her. Adamat saw that path\nending with his death by Privileged sorcery.\n“Who’s the message for?”\n“Privileged Borbador,” Rozalia said. “The last remaining member of\nManhouch’s royal cabal. He’s at Shouldercrown Fortress. Tell him that she\nwill try to summon Kresimir.”\n“That’s it?” Adamat said.\nRozalia gave a curt nod.\n“And Kresimir’s Promise?”\nShe laughed. It was a sharp noise. “Ask Borbador. He’ll know.”\nThere were boots on the marble in the Archives’ main foyer. Rozalia\nturned and ran, vaulting a table like a woman half her age. She had just\ndisappeared down a far aisle when soldiers appeared from the shelving\naisles on the opposite side. They wore the colors of the Wings mercenaries\nand they pointed their rifles at Adamat and SouSmith.\nAdamat raised his hands and sighed. “Tell Field Marshal Tamas that\nInspector Adamat is here to see him.”\nThe mercenaries glanced at one another.\n“Well?” Adamat said. “He’s nearby, isn’t he?”\nOne of the mercenaries headed back down an aisle. SouSmith glowered\nat Adamat.\n“Not a word,” Adamat whispered. “If I’d known Tamas was going to\ntake the Archives today, we wouldn’t have spent the last two days mucking\nthrough storm drains.”\n“Bastard,” SouSmith said, glancing down at his sodden shoes.\n“Inspector?” Field Marshal Tamas emerged from one of the shelving\naisles.

He carried a saw-handled dueling pistol, the powder on the barrel\nsuggesting it had been used recently. “What the pit are you doing here?”\n“Inspecting, sir,” Adamat said.\n“Of course,” Tamas said distractedly, looking Adamat and SouSmith up\nand down, and sniffed. “Have you been in the sewer?”\n“The storm drains.”\n“Very resourceful.” Tamas glanced at the mercenaries behind him.\n“Stand down. Inspector Adamat is under my employ. Check the rest of the\nlibrary.” The mercenaries headed off, and Tamas turned back to Adamat.\n“Have you solved my riddle, Inspector?”\n“I have a lead, sir. Nothing definite yet. The books I’m looking for have\ncome up defaced or entirely missing.”\n“I expect you to do more than spend your days leafing through books.”\n“That’s often exactly what investigating entails, sir,” Adamat huffed.\n“One follows any lead one can.”\n“Very well. Carry on. Wait.”\nAdamat paused.\n“What do you know about the Black Street Barbers?”\nAdamat summoned up his knowledge of them, thinking it over for a\nmoment. “Their leader is a man named Teef. Among Adro’s underworld\nthey’re considered the top assassins. They’ll take any job, is the rumor, as\nlong as it pays well. At least a dozen Barbers have tried killing Adran kings\nover the last few hundred years, when the price has been right. None have\nsucceeded, not with the royal cabal there to protect them. I’ve met Teef.\nHe’s the… least mentally unbalanced of the crew. Frankly, the entire gang\nbelongs in an insane asylum. I hope you’re not thinking of…”\nTamas nodded briskly. “Thank you.” He strode away.\n“… employing them,” Adamat finished quietly.\nAdamat retrieved his cane from where he’d dropped it when the\nmercenaries arrived. He glanced the way Rozalia had gone and pondered\nher cryptic message. “Time to go to Shouldercrown,” he said to SouSmith.\n“Jakob!” Nila pushed past a royalist soldier and tripped over brick rubble\nthat had spilled out into the street from the latest artillery blast. She lifted\nher skirt and was back on her feet, stumbling along as she shouted the boy’s\nname.\nThere was blood on her dress. The cannonball had whistled over her\nshoulder and taken the head off a man named Penn as they’d sat over a\nmeager breakfast. She could still hear the sound in her head like a horrible\nkettle, instantaneous death passing inches from her ear. The cannonball had\nknocked a hole in the wall behind Penn, straight through Jakob’s room in\none of the more intact buildings behind the barricades. Penn’s body still sat\nin his chair, shoulders slumped, one hand clutching a spoon. Jakob should\nhave been in bed. He wasn’t.\nNila found one of Jakob’s Hielmen guards picking grit out of his\nuniform. His name was Bystre, and he was about thirty-five. A steadiness\nabout him reminded her of the bearded sergeant back at Duke Eldaminse’s\ntownhouse.\n“Where’s Jakob?” she asked.\n“He’s not in bed?” Bystre said."

Find Jakob.”\nHe helped her to her feet and they ran through the street, calling Jakob’s\nname. Nila heard the crack of muskets and was struck by the choking smell\nof spent powder. Down the street was one of the barricades. Royalist\nsoldiers and volunteers crouched behind it, shooting at unseen Adran\nsoldiers on the other side.\nThe parley had been five days ago. Every day since, Field Marshal\nTamas’s soldiers had pressed the attack. Cannon and musket fire resounded\nday and night. The air reeked of sulfurous black powder.\nSomeone shouted a warning. A moment later, blue uniforms swarmed\nover the top of the barricade like water bursting through a dam.\n“Run,” Bystre instructed. “Fall back to the next barricade!” he shouted\nat nearby volunteers.\nBystre grabbed Nila by the arm. “We have to find Jakob,” he said. He\nspun suddenly, his plumed hat falling from his head as an Adran soldier\nappeared from a nearby alleyway. Bystre drew his sword, parrying the\nthrust of a bayonet. The soldier cracked him across the jaw with a rifle butt.\nBystre fell to the ground. The soldier stood over him, bayonet ready.\nNila could barely lift the paving brick she grabbed. She swung it up\nover her head and brought it down on the back of the Adran soldier’s neck.\nThe man collapsed to the ground without a sound. Bystre held his jaw and\ntried to shake off the blow.\nShe pulled him to his feet.\n“There!” she said. She caught sight of Jakob running across the street,\ncloser to the barricade. A bullet kicked up dirt in front of the boy, startling\nhim, and he fell with tears in his eyes.\nAdran soldiers had taken the barricade. They were barely a hundred feet\nfrom Jakob. Nila was half that distance. She lifted her skirts and ran. She\ncould hear Bystre right behind her. The soldiers on the barricade were more\ninterested in securing their victory than they were in a stray child in the\nstreet. Nila fell to her knees beside Jakob and swept him up in her arms.\nBystre helped her to her feet, and they both ran toward safety.\nNila stopped short when she realized Bystre was not beside her\nanywhere. She turned to see him staring back toward the fallen barricade.\n“It’s lost,” she said.\n“Him!” Bystre drew his sword.\n“What are you…” She saw it. Field Marshal Tamas stood on the\nbarricade with his men, surveying the street beyond. Beside him, she saw\nsomeone familiar. The bearded sergeant who had saved her that night in the\ntownhouse kitchen.\n“Bystre, we have to get Jakob to safety.”\n“Nothing is safe from that treacherous bastard.”"

The bearded sergeant who had saved her that night in the\ntownhouse kitchen.\n“Bystre, we have to get Jakob to safety.”\n“Nothing is safe from that treacherous bastard.”\n“General Westeven…”\n“The General is dead.”\nNila didn’t know what to say. She knew General Westeven had been\nwounded at the parley, but the royalists had been told he’d survived. Only\nhe could match someone like Field Marshal Tamas in strategic\nmaneuvering. Now their cause was truly lost.\nNila looked toward the next barricade. Royalists waved her forward to\nthe relative safety. She clutched Jakob to her chest. He held his hands over\nhis ears, and she could feel his shoulders heave as he sobbed.\n“Bystre,” she said, pleading. Where was Rozalia? She was their only\nhope now. She could bring down her Privileged sorceries on Tamas and his\narmy and drive them from the streets.\nBystre snatched up a spent rifle from a dead soldier and checked the\nbayonet. He dusted the powder from the pan and, clutching the rifle with\nboth hands, charged alone toward the fallen barricade.\nThe bearded sergeant pointed toward Bystre and lifted his rifle. Field\nMarshal Tamas turned. He tilted his head, as if bemused by the enraged\nHielman rushing toward him. He drew a pistol and pulled the trigger.\nBystre jerked and fell, his body rolling once with forward momentum\nbefore twitching and falling still. The bullet had pierced his eye at more\nthan one hundred paces. Field Marshal Tamas waved the smoke from the\nbarrel of his pistol.\nNila screamed.\nShe saw the field marshal gesture toward her and waited for another\nbullet to come and pierce her brain. It never came. Instead, Adran soldiers\nran down the barricade and toward her. She stared at them, in shock, until\nshe remembered Jakob in her arms.\nNila turned to run to the next barricade. She had a lead on the Adran\nsoldiers, but they were far faster. She tripped and struggled on the hem of\nher dress. Forty feet away, the royalists fired from behind the next barricade\nto give her cover. Bullets ricocheted off the paving stones around her, the\nscent of gunpowder making her choke. Thirty feet to go.\nSomeone hit her from behind. She fell, turning to see Adran soldiers\nupon her. She screamed and struggled, but Jakob was pulled from her arms.\nOne of the soldiers turned to her, bayonet ready to shove through her belly.\nHe twisted the rifle at the last second and pushed her away with the stock\nand the soldiers retreated, taking a screaming Jakob with them.\nNila struggled to her feet and staggered after them. They couldn’t take\nhim. Not now, not after she’d protected him this long. She stopped beside\nBystre’s body. He lay on his belly, his one remaining eye staring sightlessly\nacross the street. Flies had already started to buzz around the bloody hole in\nhis skull. She fell to her knees and vomited.\nSomeone pulled her out of the street and into a rubble-strewn alley\nbefore the shooting resumed.\nNila sagged against the partially intact wall of a tenement. “You let"

She let her hands fall.\n“This is no longer my fight,” Rozalia said.\n“You could have stopped them,” Nila accused. “You could have killed\nTamas right then. You could have protected Bystre.” She heard her voice\ncrack and felt the tears on her cheeks. She wiped them away with a grimy\nsleeve.\n“General Westeven is dead,” Rozalia said. “There is no reason to\nprolong this fight any longer.” She paused for a moment, staring back into\nNila’s accusing eyes. “Yes, I could have killed Tamas, but damage has been\ndone on a scope you cannot imagine. At this point, killing Tamas would\nonly multiply that damage.”\n“Bystre,” Nila said.\n“I don’t expect you to understand,” Rozalia said. Her voice softened\nsuddenly. “You are a brave girl. A smart girl. I only expect you to move on.\nTamas has the boy. Westeven is dead. The other royalists will drag this out\nfor as long as they can, but Tamas will win eventually. Get out while you\nstill can. There is a path through the rubble in the southwestern corner of\nthe barricades. Neither side knows about it. Take that way out. Gather what\nmoney you can and live a full life far from here.” Something wistful entered\nRozalia’s eyes. “Fatrasta is nice this time of year.”\n“What will he do to Jakob?” Nila asked.\nRozalia held out a hand. Nila accepted and got to her feet.\n“Jakob,” she said again when Rozalia did not answer. “What will\nTamas do with him?”\n“Tamas is pragmatic,” Rozalia said. “If he were to allow a monarchal\nheir to survive, he could have this situation all over again. He’ll do away\nwith the boy quietly.”\nNila dried the tears in her eyes. She felt something harden in her heart at\nthe thought of Jakob’s blond head dropping into a basket.\n“Leave Adro,” Rozalia said. “That’s what I’ll do, when my work here is\ndone. Here.” She dug something from a pocket sewn into her jacket and\npressed it into Nila’s hand. A hundred-krana coin.\n“Thank you,” Nila said. Rozalia waved dismissively and picked her way\ndown the alley, away from the barricades. Nila waited a few moments,\nthinking of the coin in her hand and the silver hidden outside the city. She\ncould still see Bystre from the alley. His body lay unmoving beneath the\nconstant exchange of gunfire between royalists and Adran soldiers. Nila\nmade a fist around the coin. It was enough for new clothes and a coach all\nthe way to Brudania. Along with her silver, it was enough for a new life.\nShe saw Field Marshal Tamas in her mind as he coolly gunned down\nBystre.\nShe couldn’t start a new life, not with memories of what had happened."

Its bastion walls were sloped and smooth despite the harsh\nweather at this altitude, a testament to the powerful sorceries that had built\nand warded them five hundred years ago. To the southeast, the amber plains\nof Kez rolled out in the distance. To the northwest, the far mountains that\nringed Adro could be seen past the hills and forests. Adopest nestled like a\ndiamond on the teardrop tip of the Adsea. To the north, South Pike’s peak\nsmoked ominously.\nAdamat turned away from the edge of the bastion. Seeing the whole\nworld laid out like that made his head spin, and he wanted to head back into\nthe town—a whole town inside the bastion, that’s how large it was!—yet\nthe Mountainwatch soldier had told him to wait here for Privileged\nBorbador. They could have offered him a room. It was far below freezing at\nthis height. Seemed they wanted to see him shiver.\nAdamat was exhausted physically and mentally. Even with modern\nroads the trip was five days by coach, and they had barely stopped to rest.\nHis body hurt from sitting on an uncomfortable, constantly jostling seat. His\nhead pounded from too little rest. Rozalia’s cryptic warning about a woman\ntrying to summon Kresimir had given him nightmares the few times he\ncaught any sleep. What was wrong with him? He was a modern man. An\neducated man. Kresimir was a myth, an embodiment of monastic power that\nkept the peasants in line.\n“What are you doing?”\nSouSmith paused in the middle of loading one of his short-barrel\npistols. The weapon looked like a toy in his big hands. “What does it look\nlike?”\n“You think he’s going to kill us?” Adamat asked. “Just for asking a\nquestion?”\n“Last Privileged almost did us in.”\n“And?”\n“And what?”\n“This is a Privileged, SouSmith. If he doesn’t want to talk to us, he\nwaves a hand and sweeps us from this bastiontop.”\nSouSmith shrugged. “You paid me to be a bodyguard, eh?”\n“Yes.” Adamat sighed. SouSmith didn’t seem to understand. This was a\nPrivileged. There was no guarding anybody against one of these.\n“Even a Privileged has to come through me to get ya.” SouSmith\nresumed loading the weapon.\nAdamat stifled a smile and realized the words had banished some of his\nnervousness. He was up here on the roof of the world, a five-day journey\nfrom Adopest. He was at a Mountainwatch. Everyone knew the\nMountainwatch was filled with convicts and cutthroats and the very hardest\nmen in the Nine. They tended the high passes, manned the mines and the\ntimber yards, and they were Adro’s first defense against a foreign invasion.\nAdamat trusted his country with the Mountainwatch far more than he\ntrusted them with his life.\n“What’s a Privileged doin’ out here anyway?” SouSmith finished\nloading his pistols and stuck them in his belt.

He leaned against one of the\nfixed guns that faced toward Kez.\n“Exiled.” Adamat watched his breath come out white.\n“What for?”\n“Officially? There was a shift in power within the royal cabal, and\nBorbador was on the wrong side. Unofficially, rumor has it he slept with\nPrivileged Khen’s favorite concubine.”\nSouSmith grunted a laugh. “And he kept his skin?”\n“Of course I did.”\nThe Privileged approached them from the town within the bastion. He\nwas far enough away that he shouldn’t have heard any of that. He wore a\nlong reindeer-skin jacket that went to his knees, and boots, pants, and a hat\nto match. He was shorter than Adamat had expected. Under a ruddy beard,\nloose skin hung from what once had been jowls. The Mountainwatch was\nkind to no one—not even a Privileged.\nThe Privileged stopped a few feet from them. His hands were tucked\ninto his sleeves, but Adamat thought he caught sight of the white of\nPrivileged’s gloves.\n“It wasn’t hard, really,” the Privileged said. “I told Magus Khen that my\nbest friend would come after him if he killed me.”\n“And who’s that?”\n“Taniel Two-Shot. I’m Privileged Borbador. Call me Bo.”\nAdamat extended a hand. Bo took it in his gloved hand with surprising\nstrength. “Inspector Adamat. This is my associate, SouSmith.”\nBo squinted at SouSmith. “The boxer?”\n“That’s right,” SouSmith said, surprised.\n“Used to go see you fight when I was a kid,” Bo said. “Taniel and I would\nsneak off and watch you. He lost a lot of money betting against you.”\n“And you?”\n“Made me wealthy—for a kid.”\nAdamat examined the man. He knew little about this Privileged beyond\ncity rumor. It was never wise to know too much about any members of the\nroyal cabal. “Seems strange, a Privileged and a powder mage being\nfriends.”\n“Met long before either of us knew what we were,” Bo said. “I was an\norphan when Taniel befriended me. Tamas let me live in the basement.\nEven paid for a governess. Said that if Taniel was going to have friends,\nthey’d be educated. It was a shock to all of us when the magus seekers\ndowsed me out. I haven’t seen Taniel since he went to Fatrasta.”\n“Aren’t Privileged allergic to powder?”\n“My eyes puff up whenever I’m around him,” Bo acknowledged.\n“Always wondered about that as a kid. So. What brings a gentleman like\nyou to the Mountainwatch? You don’t look like Tamas’s assassins.”\n“We’re not assassins,” Adamat said quickly. “Though I don’t blame you\nfor wondering. I am working for Field Marshal Tamas. I doubt you’d still\nbe alive if he wanted you otherwise.”\nBo swayed backward on his feet. “He doesn’t know,” he murmured.\n“Doesn’t know what?”\n“Nothing.

Why did you seek me out?” His conversational tone\ndisappeared, his smile fading.\n“What is Kresimir’s Promise?”\nBo watched him for a few moments. “You’re serious?”\n“Quite.”\n“Tamas sent you all the way up here to ask me that?”\n“I came on my own,” Adamat said. “But I’m searching for the answer\non behalf of Field Marshal Tamas.” Half disbelief, half mockery, Bo’s\nreaction stirred some disquiet in him.\nIt seemed as if relief washed over Bo. He cracked a smile, then began to\nchuckle. “Let me guess,” he said. “When Tamas slaughtered the royal\ncabal, their dying words were something along the lines of ‘Don’t break\nKresimir’s Promise’?”\nAdamat gritted his teeth. This Privileged was beginning to irk him. He\nseemed to find great mirth in knowing what Adamat did not. “Yes,” he said.\n“You laugh at the dying words of sorcerers? Was it some kind of morbid\njoke? A spell woven to baffle anyone who killed them?”\nBo’s chuckle tapered off. “Not at all. Those Privileged were in deadly\nearnest. A spell can be woven, a ward of sorts, that will speak itself upon a\nsorcerer’s death. A joke? No. That’s the kind of thing I might do. But not\nthose men. They believed every bit of it.”\n“And what does it mean?”\n“Kresimir’s Promise.” Bo rolled the words around in his mouth like a\nbite of something sour. “Legend has it when Kresimir formed the Nine, he\nchose nine kings to govern the nations he’d created. To each king he\nassigned a royal cabal of sorcerers to protect and advise him. He called\nthem the Privileged. The kings, seeing that the Privileged were men of great\npower, told Kresimir that they were worried that the royal cabals might turn\nagainst them and take power for themselves. So Kresimir gave them a\npromise.\n“He promised them that their lines would rule the Nine forever—that\ntheir seed would never bring forth barren fruit, as it were. Kresimir told his\nnewly appointed Privileged that if anyone were to end one of those lines\nthrough violence, he would return personally and destroy the entire nation.”\nHe leaned back when he’d finished speaking, like a schoolboy who had\nremembered his lesson. “What do you think of that?”\n“I’m a man of reason…” Adamat said. Yet he couldn’t help the shiver\nthat went up his spine.\n“Of course you are,” Bo said. “Most men these days are. It’s a stupid\nlegend. One of many stories to keep the royal cabals in their place.\nKresimir’s reign was almost fourteen hundred years ago—at a guess. It\ncould have been longer. Not even the kings really believe it, and only the\nvery oldest members of the royal cabal do.” Bo reached up and touched\nsomething beneath his coat. “No, there are far more effective ways to keep\ntabs on the royal cabal.”\n“What should I tell Tamas?” Adamat asked.\nBo shrugged. “Tell Tamas what you like.

Tell Tamas to worry about\nimportant things, like feeding the people or”—he pointed out over the\nbastion wall toward Kez—“them.”\nAdamat took a deep breath. He let it come out slowly. “So that’s it,\nthen,” he said.\n“That’s it. Though,” Bo added, “I don’t know why you couldn’t find\nthat in the library. There are a dozen books that mention it.”\n“Burned,” Adamat said. “Pages missing and passages snubbed out. By a\nPrivileged, in all likelihood.”\nBo scowled. “Privileged should know better. Books are important. They\nlink us to the past, to the future. Every written word gives us another hint\nabout how to control the Else.”\n“Bo!” a voice called from the bastion town.\nHe turned around.\n“We’re going to the quarry!”\n“Five minutes!” Bo yelled back. He removed his hands from his sleeves\nand flexed his gloved fingers. “Bastards are getting lazy,” he said. “They\nthink just because they have a Privileged, they can get me to cut stone, fell\ntrees, and clear avalanches. Cleaning up after that quake nearly wrung me\nout last week. Well, I’m sorry my answer wasn’t very dramatic. If you see\nTaniel Two-Shot, give him my hello.”\nBo was halfway back to the town when Adamat remembered the\nmessage he’d promised to give. He jogged to catch up with the Privileged.\n“There was a message,” he said.\n“From Taniel?”\n“No, from a Privileged named Rozalia.”\nBo shrugged. “Don’t know anyone by that name.”\n“Well, she told me to give you a message.”\n“And?”\n“These were her words: ‘She is going to summon Kresimir.’ I don’t\nknow which ‘she’ the woman was talking about. I don’t think she meant\nherself. I…”\nBo had frozen in place. All color drained from his face. He stumbled to\none side. Adamat caught him. “What does it mean?”\nBo pushed him away. The man’s teeth were chattering. “Pit and\ndamnation. Get away! Go on, get back to Adopest. Tell Tamas to mobilize\nhis army! Tell Taniel to get out of the country. Tell him… Shit!” The last\nword was a snarl, and Bo went sprinting across the bastion back toward the\ntown.\nAdamat stood in place, stunned.\nSouSmith walked up beside him, tapping old tobacco out of his pipe.\n“He’s an odd one,” he mused.\n“I don’t like this,” Tamas said.\n“I don’t think anyone does, my friend.”\nTamas glanced back at Sabon. The Deliv stood beneath a large parasol,\neyes on the distant barricades. Sweat beaded on his clean-shaved head like\nwater on a cold glass. The day was unseasonably hot for this early in the\nspring.

He turned to regard Tamas, though the\nquestion had not been directed at him.\n“I think not,” Sabon said. “They may not like the feel of it. War is\nsupposed to be a gentleman’s game, after all. They’ll understand, though.\nThey will respect that you won’t throw lives away in a needless battle. They\nwill respect that you don’t want to shell your own city.”\nTamas nodded slowly. “I’ve never resorted to assassination before. Not\nin twenty-five years of command.”\n“I can remember a few times you should have,” Sabon said. “Remember\nthat shah we fought in southeastern Gurla?”\n“I try not to.” Tamas leaned over and spit. He lifted his canteen to his\nlips, still watching the barricades. He could hear musket shots and the\noccasional report of artillery from about two miles away, where Brigadier\nRyze was commanding an assault on the armory. “I’ve met some bad men\nin my day,” Tamas said, thinking of the shah. “But that man was a monster.\nHe’d have a man’s entire extended family buried alive if he questioned a\ncommand.”\n“You had him gelded,” Sabon said.\nOlem choked. He tossed his cigarette on the ground and began\ncoughing smoke.\n“War is most definitely not a gentleman’s game, my friend,” Tamas\nsaid. “Else I wouldn’t play.” He glanced at Olem. “Give us a minute.”\nOlem moved out of earshot, still coughing. Tamas joined Sabon beneath\nthe parasol. He produced a letter from his pocket and gave it to Sabon.\n“Your new commission,” Tamas said.\nSabon took the letter. “What?”\n“I’ve put Andriya and Vadalslav to sniffing out more powder mages.\nWith the royal cabal dead, I think the mages will be more likely to come\nforward. Not to mention the pay we’re offering,” he said. “They’ve set up\nshop outside of town, near the university, and will soon be heading to Deliv\nand Novi and Unice to recruit. I want you with them.”\n“No,” Sabon said, trying to give the letter back.\n“I’m your commanding officer,” Tamas said. “You can’t say no.”\n“I can say no to my old friend,” Sabon said.\n“Why won’t you do it?”\nSabon grunted. “Andriya and Vadalslav are more than enough to take\ncare of recruits. You’ve sent the others to the Gates of Wasal. Taniel is\nchasing a ghost around the city, and despite the fact that you assigned Vlora\nto your staff, you’re still too angry to even speak to her.

Do we even know if the Barbers were successful?”\n“You’re worried about me?” Tamas said. “That’s your excuse?”\n“Worried that you’ll bugger it all up and need someone to clean up\nthings after you.” Sabon paused. They could both hear shouting from\nbeyond the barricade. “Perhaps we should help them,” he said.\n“Damned Barbers can do it themselves,” Tamas said. “I won’t fret if\nthey all get themselves killed. Don’t try to change the subject. Vadalslav\nsaid they’ve already found seven candidates with a little talent. They say\nthree of them have potential.”\n“It takes years to fully train a powder mage,” Sabon said. “They need to\nbe taught to control their powers and how to be a soldier all at the same\ntime.”\n“That’s why I want you there,” Tamas said. “You trained Taniel and\nVlora practically single-handed. Now Taniel is the best marksman in the\nworld, and Vlora can detonate a keg of powder from half a mile.”\n“That’s not the same, and you know it.” Sabon was angry now, his dark\neyes glinting dangerously. “Taniel has been shooting since he could hold a\ngun. Vlora… well, she’s just a prodigy.”\n“You don’t have to go recruiting,” Tamas said. “But I want you to start\na school. You’ll have a line of credit and will have say over all happenings.\nYou’ll never be more than a few hours away from me. If I need help, I’ll\nsummon you immediately.”\n“I have your word?” Sabon said.\n“You have my word.”\nSabon stuffed the envelope in his pocket. “I want to be here when the\nKez ambassador arrives.”\n“Certainly.”\n“And don’t look so pleased.”\nTamas stifled a smile.\n“Sir!” Olem returned. He pointed toward the barricades.\nA figure was slowly picking his way over the barricades and then down\ninto the street, where he maneuvered among the untouched earthquake\nrubble. He wore a long white apron over a white shirt and black trousers.\nThe apron front was covered in red.\nThe man headed straight toward them. He snapped open a razor, the\nblade glinting in the sunlight. Tamas saw Olem tense. The razor was\ntouched to the man’s forehead in a mock salute.\n“Teef, sir, of the Black Street Barbers,” the man said. “The barricades\nare yours.”\n“The royalist leaders?”\n“Dead or captured,” Teef said. “But mostly dead.”\nTamas snorted. “Women and children?”\nThe man snapped his razor shut and opened it again.

But his whole arm had been\ngone, and Westeven was old and no powder mage. “Olem, see that the\nBlack Street Barbers are rounded up and kept safe until we have a chance to\npay them.”\n“Now, look here,” Teef said, taking a step toward Tamas. Olem was\nbetween them in a second, his bayonet a hair from Teef’s bloody apron.\nTeef swallowed.\nTamas gestured for the closest mercenary captain. “Don’t worry, Teef,”\nTamas said. “If you kept your side of the bargain, I will keep mine. I’d love\nto throw you into Sabletooth, but I’m a man of my word. And… you may\nprove useful in the future.”\nTamas left Teef behind and approached the barricades with Sabon,\nOlem, and an entire company of the Wings of Adom. Tamas reached out\nwith his senses, looking for powder charges. He sensed a small munitions\ndump near the barricade and a scattering of discarded powder.\nTamas climbed to the top of the barricade and looked around. From the\nfew barricades they’d captured he knew what to expect: the semblance of a\nsoldier’s camp, the street clear of debris, makeshift flags hung above the\ndoors of homes and shops that’d been turned into barracks.\nThe streets were filled with people. Far more of them than Tamas had\nexpected. Hundreds of women and children. Far fewer men. Their faces\nwere painted with fear, with dejection, with loss. The faces of people who\nawoke to find their husbands, their friends, and their fathers and leaders\nwith throats cut in their beds. People had little fight in them after an\nexperience like that.\nEach huddled group of people had a Barber watching over them, armed\nwith a pistol or a club, sometimes with nothing more than a bared razor. It\nseemed to be enough.\n“Brigadier Sabastenien,” Tamas said.\nThe young brigadier climbed the barricade to stand beside him. “Sir?”\n“Have your men relieve the Barbers. Begin filing these people out of the\nbarricades.”\n“To Sabletooth, sir?”\n“No,” Tamas said. He surveyed those faces once more. “I suspect that\nthose most responsible for the royalist uprising have already met their fates.\nI want all survivors taken to the old bailey. Disarm them, but then feed\nthem. Have them checked by doctors and given beds. They’re no longer\nroyalists. They are citizens. They are our countrymen.”\n“My men aren’t nursemaids, sir.”\n“They are now. Dismissed.”\nTamas watched as mercenary soldiers went down among the royalists.\nVoices were subdued, quiet, and for the most part everyone went willingly.\nSoldiers began the work of dismantling the barricades. Every so often,\nheads would turn when cannon fire echoed from the south.\n“Sabon, send word to Brigadier Ryze. Tell him we’ve taken the main\nbarricade. Tell him to offer parley.

If the Barbers have done their work through the whole royalist\ncamp, I suspect the offer will be taken.”\n“You intend to pardon them all, sir?” Olem asked.\n“If I treat them like animals, like criminals, then I will have a second\nroyalist uprising on my hands. If I treat them like citizens, if I restore them\nto their places in this city, if I make them belong, that is the best solution. I\nwill not perform another round of executions.”\n“Probably wise, sir,” Olem said.\nTamas gave the man a long look. “I’m glad you approve.”\n“Well, sir, even with you offering a month’s wages, no one will clean\nthe blood out of Elections Square. Stained the stones rust. They say the\ndried blood is a half-foot deep in some places. Wouldn’t want to add to\nthat.”\n“Elections Square?”\n“Formerly the King’s Garden, sir. It’s been renamed.”\n“I hadn’t heard that.”\n“Well, you’ve been awfully busy, what with the barricades and all.”\n“Why Elections Square?”\nOlem chuckled. “Well, kind of a dark joke, that. See, the people see\nthose executions as a kind of election.”\n“There was no voting.”\n“I think the vote was cast when the people tore those Hielmen to\nshreds.”\nA mercenary soldier came jogging toward them through the now\norderly lines of royalists leaving the barricades. The man snapped a salute.\n“Sir, Brigadier Sabastenien said you’d want to know. We found General\nWesteven.”\nThe general was in a small room behind what had once been a flea\nmarket. His quarters were damp, cold. They seemed too small for such a\ngreat man. Tamas had to duck to enter the room.\nWesteven lay faceup on a cot. A few meager possessions were scattered\non the dresser—aside from the bed, the only piece of furniture. They\nincluded a pocket-sized portrait of Westeven’s late wife; a Gurlan hunting\nknife, the handle well worn; a beaded native’s fetish; a pair of spectacles;\nand a neatly folded handkerchief.\nTamas frowned down at the body. Westeven lay beneath a thin blanket,\nfar too short for his long body, stockinged feet sticking out the bottom.\nThey’d cleaned up his body, but burns were still visible. His eyes were\nclosed. Even in death his one good hand still clutched at an old leather-\nbound book. He’d survived losing an arm, it seemed—if only for an hour or\nso. The man’s aged fingers were bent from rheumatism.\nTamas turned his head to read the title of the book in Westeven’s hand:\nThe Age of Kresimir. He hadn’t known Westeven to be religious.\nTamas picked up the Gurlan hunting knife and the native’s fetish.\n“Brigadier,” he said softly.\nSabastenien ducked beneath the entrance and joined him. There was\nbarely enough space in the dark room for them both.\n“Have the general’s body sent to his next of kin.”"

There was\nbarely enough space in the dark room for them both.\n“Have the general’s body sent to his next of kin.”\nSabastenien took off his hat. “I don’t believe the general has any living\nrelatives.”\nTamas felt a lump in his throat and swallowed. When he’d regained his\ncomposure, he said, “I will claim the body. Send word to the city reeve. I\nwant full honors for the general’s burial—a state burial. No expense is to be\nspared. I’ll pay for it from my own pocket if need be.”\nSabastenien didn’t answer. When Tamas turned, he saw that unshed\ntears glistened in the young brigadier’s eyes.\n“Sir,” Sabastenien said. “I formally request that General Westeven be\nburied in the Wings of Adom cemetery. I’m sure Lady Winceslav would\nagree.”\nTamas lay a hand on Sabastenien’s shoulder. “Thank you,” he said.\nSuch a thing was the greatest honor. The Wings of Adom were tough ranks\nto join living, harder to join dead.\nSabastenien left Tamas alone with the body. Tamas lay his hat on\nWesteven’s chest and took a deep breath.\n“A poor scrap to go out in,” Tamas said. “I’m sorry, my friend. Yet you\nwent out fighting for what you believed. I’ve got the Kez to deal with next,\nand how I wish I had you by my side for that.”\nChapter 13\nShe’s here,” Julene said.\nTaniel frowned at the Privileged mercenary. She wore a wicked small\nsmile, tugged up farther on one side by the scar on her face, and her eyes\nwere unnaturally wide. It reminded Taniel of a cougar he’d once seen at a\ncircus. They stood at the front gates of Adopest University. The walls\nsurrounding the collegiate town were little more than crumbling relics\nbeyond which flags waved in the brisk breeze on the towers of the\nuniversity buildings. Taniel could hear the sound of students laughing. This\nwas not a good place to confront a Privileged.\nYet far better than the crowded city.\n“You sure?” Taniel asked. He’d not opened his third eye in days. The\nlast time, he’d nearly collapsed. He told himself it wasn’t because he’d been\nin a powder trance for four weeks running. He wasn’t powder blind. He\nwasn’t addicted.\nHe snorted a line of powder off the back of his hand and shivered.\nJulene ignored his question. “Well?” Taniel asked Gothen.\nThe magebreaker nodded. “She’s here,” he confirmed.\nTaniel looked around for Ka poel. She was studying the gargoyles\n‑\nabove the gate. A group of male students were studying her. Taniel glared\nat them, setting a hand on the butt of his pistol.\n“Is that a real savage?” one of them asked.\n“You have to have a permit to carry a weapon on university grounds,”\nanother informed him.\n“Sod off,” Taniel said. “Wait.

Where can I find a map of the\nuniversity?”\nThe boy—Taniel thought of him as a boy, though he might have been\nthe same age—sniffed. “Sod off yourself.”\nTaniel turned toward the group until they could see his powder keg pin.\n“That supposed to impress us?” the boy asked.\nTaniel grinned. “It will when I beat your teeth in.” He snatched his\npistol from his belt and flipped it around until he held it by the barrel. He\nflipped it again, then spun it around his middle finger until he held it the\nright way.\n“Fancy,” one of the boys said with a laugh. “Administrator’s office.\nHead through the gate, take a right. You’ll run into it eventually.”\n“Thanks,” Taniel said. “And yes, she’s a savage. My savage.” His grin\ndisappeared when he turned to find Ka poel glaring at him.\n‑\nHe cleared his throat. “Let’s find a map of the university. Julene, how\nclose can you get to her without her sensing you?”\n“I don’t care if she knows I’m coming.”\n“I do,” Taniel snapped. “Don’t be a damned fool.”\nKa poel tapped herself on the chest, then walked a pair of fingers\n‑\nthrough the air.\n“You can get close?” Taniel said.\nKa poel rolled her eyes.\n‑\nOf course she could. Ka poel could practically walk up and poke a\n‑\nPrivileged without being noticed. Taniel wondered where his mind was at.\nIt was the damned powder, he decided. When this was over, he’d go a\nmonth without touching the stuff.\n“All right. Pole, find the Privileged. I want to know exactly where she\nis, down to the building and the room. You two,” he said, pointing at the\nmercenaries. “Wait for Captain Ajucare.” The captain had been trailing\nthem for a week at Tamas’s orders. Far enough to stay out of the way, and\nclose enough to be there if he was needed.\nA quick glance down the road gave Taniel a glimpse of men on\nhorseback in the distance. “Tell him to begin evacuating the university.\nWe’re going to take this Privileged here, now. Gothen, will you be able to\ncut off her access to the Else?”\n“Of course.”\n“No problems this time?”\n“None,” Gothen said. “I won’t make the same mistake I made last\ntime.”\nAll that was needed was for Gothen to be able to get close enough to cut\noff her sorcery. If bullets and blades weren’t enough to kill her, it would\ngive Julene the chance she needed to use her own sorcery.\n“An evacuation will tip our hand,” Julene said.\n“I’m not going to let a bunch of students get killed in the crossfire if we\nmess up and the two of you begin to throw around sorcery.”\nJulene sneered at him.\n“I’ll be back,” Taniel said.\nTaniel headed through the gates and toward the administration building.\nA series of signposts gave him better directions.

The buildings were huge, built of somber gray stone\nwith towering spires and wide arches. They were separated by open spaces\nwhere students lounged on the grass. Taniel walked through a large quad\nand past the library. His rifle was getting looks.\n“Can I help you, sir?”\nA man of perhaps forty intercepted him as he headed up the stairs of the\nadministration building.\n“Powder Mage Taniel,” Taniel said. “Who are you?”\nThe man drew himself up. “Assistant to the vice-chancellor. Professor\nUskan, at your service.”\n“Professor,” Taniel said. “Is the vice-chancellor here?”\n“He’s in Adopest on business. Pardon me, are you Taniel Two-Shot?\nThe field marshal’s son?”\n“Look, I’ve got a company of soldiers about to come pouring through\nyour front gate. There’s a rogue Privileged on your university grounds.\nWe’re hunting her on orders of my fa— on orders of Field Marshal Tamas.”\nUskan’s eyes grew wide. “Wha… No, you can’t fight here. This is a\nuniversity.”\n“We’ll do our best not to. Do you have an evacuation plan?”\n“What? No…”\n“Well, you should come up with one. Now. The soldiers are from the\nWings of Adom. Send word for the students to get out.”\n“Get out? We have almost five thousand students here! The campus is\nnearly a mile across! What do you expect me to do?”\n“Think of something.”\n“What about the Privileged?”\n“We’ll deal with her.”\nThe man wrung his hands. “Privileged! There could be wholesale\ndestruction! The repairs…”\n“I’m sure it won’t come to—” Taniel froze. There she was, coming out\nof the library not a hundred yards away. Taniel began to breathe quickly.\nShe wasn’t wearing her Privileged gloves. That gave him an advantage.\n“Go on,” Taniel said. “You should evacuate the premises.”\n“But what do I say?”\n“I don’t know,” Taniel growled. He slowly reached for his pistol, trying\nnot to look obvious.\nUskan swallowed hard and looked Taniel up and down. He gave him a\nbeseeching look. “Just be careful of the Applied Sciences building,” he\nsaid. “It’s brand-new.” Taking a deep breath, he suddenly threw his arms in\nthe air.\n“Free lunch!” he yelled. “Free lunch, outside the north gate!” He began\nto run across the quad.\n“Shit,” Taniel said.\nThe woman stared at him. He snatched a pistol from his belt, hesitated.\nPeople on the quad were slowly following after Uskan. Taniel gritted his\nteeth.\nThe woman began to sprint in the opposite direction.\nTaniel aimed his pistol and pulled the trigger. The shot echoed across\nthe quad. Taniel nudged the bullet at the last second to avoid hitting a\nstudent, cursing under his breath. The bullet missed the Privileged and\nlodged in the wall of the library. There was a scream.

She rounded the edge of the library, and Taniel skidded to a halt.\nShe could be waiting just around the corner. Her sorcery would tear him\napart before he could fire a shot. Taniel looked around. His eyes fell on the\ntower back behind the administration building.\nThe bell tower was the highest point on the campus. He backtracked,\nheading through the administration building and across a botanical garden.\nThe garden was enclosed, giant sheets of glass held together in a\nlatticework of iron above. He nearly fell into the pond trying to leap it,\nregained his footing, and headed for the door to the bell tower.\nHe took the stairs of the tower two at a time. He paused in a window\nabout halfway up and surveyed the quad. He guessed he was five stories\nabove the ground. No sign of the Privileged. He went up to the next\nwindow and looked. There. She was heading across the quad between the\nmuseum and a great galleried building with large letters proclaiming it to be\nBanasher’s Hall.\nTaniel swung his rifle from his shoulder. He closed his eyes, breathing\nthe calm of a powder trance, and refocused. When he opened them again,\nhe could see her as if she were standing five paces away. She was a\nhandsome woman, with sharp features and a mole above one brow. She\nwalked briskly, still wearing her academic gown. She’d put on her\nPrivileged’s gloves. She glanced over her shoulder once.\n“Rozalia!” The call echoed across the quad.\nTaniel started. The Privileged jumped too, a wild look in her eyes.\nTaniel settled his finger on the trigger.\nSorcery ripped across his vision. Chunks of sod flew in the air, followed\nby lines of fire erupting from the ground all around the Privileged. Taniel\nblinked spots from his eyes.\nDirt rained down, obscuring half the quad. Julene walked toward the\narea, gloved hands held high. She shrieked laughter.\nTaniel caught a glimpse of an academic robe. He lifted his rifle to his\nshoulder and snapped off a shot. The bullet ricocheted inches from the\nPrivileged’s head, cracking against an invisible shield with a sound like a\nspoon tapping glass. Taniel swore.\nA lightning bolt slammed into Julene. She slid backward, her feet\ndragging turf. She somehow kept upright, hands raised above her head. A\ncrackle of energy, and the lightning bolt returned to the Privileged. The\nthunder knocked Taniel backward.\nTaniel rolled a few steps before arresting his fall. He retrieved his rifle\nand dropped a bullet down the barrel, then drew a powder charge from his\npack and crushed it between his fingers. He returned to the window, leveled\nhis rifle, and fired.\nThe Privileged spun about, blood spurting from her shoulder. She\ncaught herself on knees and one hand and looked up toward Taniel’s bell\ntower.\n“Oh, pit.”\nShe made an angled chopping motion with one hand.\nTaniel squeezed his eyes shut. Nothing. He cracked one eyelid. The\nworld was moving. From beneath him, he heard the terrible grinding sound\nof stone on stone."

From beneath him, he heard the terrible grinding sound\nof stone on stone.\nTaniel’s heart leapt into his throat. The tower was falling. Clutching his\nrifle, he leapt from the window.\nHe opened his mouth, but found he had no breath to scream. The glass\npanels of the botanical garden rushed to meet him. His feet hit first, legs\ncrumpling beneath him, and then the glass shattered. He fell the last twenty\nfeet and landed on his shoulder. He rolled onto his back and gasped. Shards\nof glass as big as a man lay everywhere around him. He was lucky none had\nlanded on him.\nPowder mages were stronger in a trance. They could withstand far more\ndamage than a regular person, and ignore far more pain. Yet a fall like that\nshould have killed him, or at least broken bones.\nThe ground rumbled. Taniel felt himself rolled by the shock wave as the\nentire top half of the bell tower slammed into the building beneath it. Stone\nground together, wood splintered. Taniel threw his hands over his head.\nWhen he looked up, the dust was settling. He slowly climbed to his feet.\nHis rifle lay twenty feet away. He stumbled toward it, stepping over\nrubble and broken glass. His body ached, but nothing was broken. He\nchecked his kit for his sketchbook. It was still there. He retrieved his rifle.\n“You and I are surviving far too much these days.”\nAnother thunderclap made him stagger. He limped out of the garden\nand into an adjoining building, avoiding the debris from the tower. He\nfound a hall where he could look out onto the quad. The end of the hall had\nbeen destroyed—the tower had landed on the administrator’s office. He\nhoped no one had been inside.\nHe threw his back to the wall just beneath the window and listened.\nAnother thunderclap. Someone was laughing. Julene. He gritted his teeth at\nthe eerie sound, reloaded his rifle, and stood up.\nThe quad had been destroyed. Ground was torn up everywhere, more\ndirt than a hundred men could move with shovels in a day, piled up as if\nscooped from the ground by a god’s hand and then patted into hills. As he\nwatched, a thin line of fire sprayed from beyond one of the mounds and tore\nthrough Banasher’s Hall across the way. Taniel saw faces watching the\nbattle from windows. They were gone in an instant, their final looks of\nhorror frozen in Taniel’s mind as the entire façade of the building crumbled.\nTaniel dropped back down behind the wall and took a deep breath. This\nwas no normal fight. No, he’d seen Privileged fight before, on the\nbattlefields in Fatrasta. They tossed fireballs and ice and lightning. But\nnothing like this. Both Julene and this other Privileged were using forces far\nbeyond Taniel’s comprehension.

Hadn’t he sent her off after\nthe Privileged? He hoped she hadn’t done anything stupid. He hoped she\nwas safe.\nHe peeked out once more. He could see the Privileged. She stood on the\ntop steps of a building kitty-corner to his own. The museum, he thought. He\nslowly lifted his rifle.\nThe Privileged’s fingers danced. She thrust one hand outward, fingers\nsplayed, toward the center of the quad. That thin fire erupted from her palm.\nJulene was lifted up from behind the newly formed hills and thrown bodily\ninto the remnants of Banasher’s Hall. Stone folded around her as she hit, the\nrest of the building crumpling like a house of paper.\nThe Privileged wiped her hands on her academic gown and went inside\nthe museum.\nTaniel leapt to his feet. He was halfway down the hall before he\nbothered to question himself. What was he doing? These were forces above\nhis ability to fight. No sense in going after her. What could he possibly do?\nHe thought of the destruction on the quad. Privileged got tired.\nPrivileged couldn’t go on forever. She couldn’t have much left in her.\nThe building he had taken shelter in was attached to the museum by a\nnarrow, raised stone walkway. Taniel stole a glance, then dashed down the\nwalkway and leapt through a door. He was in a short hall, practically a\ncustodian’s closet with mops and brooms. Another door, this one open, led\nto the main hall. He caught sight of galleries filled with ancient relics:\nmummified corpses, the bones of ancient beasts, pottery from some\nprehistoric civilization, and stones sparkling with gems. He heard the brisk\nsound of footsteps on marble.\nThe Privileged marched through the main gallery. Her shoulder still\nbled from Taniel’s only solid shot. She glanced to either side. She didn’t\nseem to see Taniel. She definitely didn’t see the movement of the\nmagebreaker above her.\nGothen leapt the banister of a gallery above and landed on the marble\nnot five feet from her. He came up, face alight with victory, a small sword\nin his hand.\nTaniel gave a yell. Yes! He jumped from cover. They had her now. She\ncouldn’t…\nThe Privileged threw her arms wide. The academic gown fluttered, then\nbegan to glow. Gothen’s eyes grew wide.\nTaniel halted. He took one step back as Gothen began to shimmer.\nTaniel tried to yell for the man to finish the job.\nThe magebreaker fell to his knees. He opened his mouth in a scream.\nNo sound came out, and his mouth kept opening farther. His jaw fell, and\nthen the rest of him began to drop like a wax figure melting before a blazing\nfire. His clothes burned off, his sword dripping to the floor as molten steel.\nHis body dissolved into a puddle at the Privileged’s feet.\nTaniel leapt behind a pillar.

The crow’s feet in the corners of her bloodshot eyes were\n‑\ndeep, lines of exhaustion tugging at her face.\n“I want you to stop following me,” she said.\n“You killed my friends.”\n“The powder mages at Skyline? That was a mistake. No. Not a mistake.\nI’d have killed them all if I’d have arrived in time to stop Tamas and his\nfoolish coup.

So she knew who he was.\nRozalia said, “Tell your savage sorceress to stand down. I don’t want to\nfight her.”\n“Pole?” Taniel looked around. No sign of her. “Get out of here,” he\ncalled. He thought he caught a glimpse of red hair behind one of the display\ncases.\n“Let me leave in peace,” Rozalia said, “and I’ll leave the country\ntonight. I swear it. I’m done here.”\n“As easy as that?” Taniel’s mind raced. Julene had to be dead after\nbeing thrown through an entire building. Gothen was a puddle on the floor.\nWhat threat could he possibly be to her? Was she that scared of his father?\nTaniel caught Rozalia’s nervous glance toward Ka poel.\n‑\nShe was scared of Ka poel? Pole was only a girl.\n‑\n“Simple as that,” Rozalia said. “I’m leaving this place. Your father has\nkicked a hornet’s nest and I intend to be gone before the hornets arrive.”\n“What do you mean?”\nRozalia shook her head. “You really don’t know, do you?

They stared at him. “Stand down, damn it,\nor we’re all dead men!”\nRifles slowly lowered. Rozalia walked down the steps as if she were a\nqueen with an honor guard.

She paused twenty or thirty feet from Taniel and turned\nback toward him. “Beware Julene,” she said before continuing on.\nIt was at least an hour later when Taniel caught sight of Julene heading\ntoward him across the quad. This was a different quad, undisturbed, in a\nquiet corner of the campus. Ka poel sat cross-legged beside him. He rested\n‑\nwith his head against the wall, his hand on his sketchbook. He’d begun\ndrawing Gothen. The man had been brave, and mercenary or not, he\ndeserved to be remembered by someone. Taniel’s head hurt. His body hurt.\nAnd the person coming toward him shouldn’t be alive.\nJulene looked like she’s been trampled by a herd of warhorses. Her\nclothing was burned and torn, indecent parts of her bared to the world,\nthough she didn’t seem to care a wit. She strode up to Taniel and paused\nabove him, hands on her hips.\n“Where is Gothen?”\n“Melted.”\nShe blanched at this, but recovered quickly enough. “Captain Ajucare\nsaid you let her go.”\nTaniel nodded. “She’s leaving the country.”\nJulene bent over, her face not a hand’s distance from Taniel’s.\n“You let that bitch go!” She raised one gloved hand.\nTaniel didn’t even remember drawing his pistol. One second his hands\nwere in his lap, folded, the next he held a pistol, the end of the barrel\npressing into the soft spot where Julene’s jaw and neck met. Her eyes went\nwide.\n“Go away,” he said.\nChapter 14\nThe Lighthouse of Gostaun had been dated by most historians back to the\nTime of Kresimir.

    "text": "Time of Kresimir. Some claimed that it was older still, and Tamas wouldn’t\nhave been surprised. It was certainly the oldest building in Adopest. The\nstone was carved by the wind, its granite blocks pitted and scored by\ncenturies of exposure to the elements, mercilessly whipped by every type of\nfoul weather to come off the Adsea.\nTamas stood on the balcony of the lantern room, his hands clutching the\nstone railing. Something was wrong. The royalists were scattered, the\ngranaries opened to the public. Already they had begun reconstruction\nefforts in the city, employing thousands to clear rubble from the streets and\nrebuild tenements. He should be concentrating completely on the\napproaching Kez ambassadors, yet he could not keep from looking to the\nsouthwest.\nSouth Pike Mountain smoked. It began as a black sliver on the horizon\nthe day of the earthquake two weeks ago. Since then it had grown tenfold.\nGreat billowing clouds of gray and ebony rose from the mountaintop,\nspreading as they gained height and blowing off over the Adsea. Historians\nsaid that the last time South Pike had erupted had been when Kresimir first\nset foot upon the holy mountain. They said that all of Kez had been covered\nin ash, that lava had destroyed hundreds of villages in Adro.\nWords like “omen” and “bad tidings” were being spoken by men far too\neducated to take such things seriously.\nHe turned away from the distant mountain and looked south. The\nlighthouse itself was no more than four stories, but it stood on a bluff that\nput it well above most other buildings in Adopest. A side of the hill had\ngiven way during the earthquake, revealing the foundation of the lighthouse\nbut sparing the structure itself. Beneath him, artillery batteries flanked the\ndocks. Tamas didn’t think those cannons had ever been fired. They were\nmostly for show, a remnant of older traditions, not unlike the\nMountainwatch itself. In its long history, the Nine had come close to war\ncountless times, but not since the Bleakening had there been actual\nbloodshed. Off in the distance a Kez galley floated at anchor, flags flying\nhigh.\n“Have those batteries tested tomorrow,” Tamas said. “We might have\nneed of them soon.”\n“Yes, sir,” Olem said. Olem and Sabon stood at his shoulders, bearing\nhis quiet reflection with patience. A full honor guard waited down on the\nbeach for the Kez delegation. Servants rushed around the beach, making\nlast-minute preparations to a welcoming repast for the visiting dignitaries.\nFood was brought out, parasols and open tents staked in the sand, liveried\nmen trying to keep them from blowing away with the wind coming in off\nthe Adsea.\nAndriya and Vlora were hidden at either end of the beach, eyes sharp\nfor Privileged, rifles loaded. Tamas was taking no chances with this\ndelegation, and the wrenching feeling deep in his gut told him he was right.\nThere were Privileged with them, his third eye had revealed as much—\nthough at this distance it was impossible to sense how many or how strong.\nA longboat was making its way from the galley to the shore.

    "text": "A longboat was making its way from the galley to the shore. Tamas put\na looking glass to his eye and counted two dozen men. There were Wardens\namong them, easy to pick out for their size and their hunched, misshaped\nshoulders and arms.\n“Ipille dares to send Wardens,” Tamas growled. “I’m tempted to blow\nthat boat out of the water right now.”\n“Of course he dares,” Sabon said. “He’s bloody king of the Kez.” Sabon\ncoughed into his hand. “The Privileged with them likely feels the same way\nabout you as you do of him. He knows you’ll have powder mages on the\nbeach.”\n“My Marked aren’t godless, sorcery-spawned killers.” Only the Kez had\nfigured out how to break a man’s spirit and twist his body to create a\nWarden. Every other royal cabal in the Nine blanched at experimenting\nwith human beings.\nSabon seemed amused by this. “What scares you more: a man who’s\nnext to impossible to kill, or a man who can kill you at a league’s distance\nwith a rifle?”\n“A Warden or a powder mage? I’m not frightened of either. Wardens\ndisgust me.” He spit on the lighthouse stones. “What’s gotten into you\ntoday? You’ve been philosophical enough lately to drive a man to tears.”\nOlem gave a strangled laugh. “Breakfast,” he said.\nTamas turned on the soldier. “Breakfast?”\n“He ate six bowls of porridge this morning,” Olem said. He tapped the\nash from his cigarette and watched it blow off with the wind. “I’ve never\nseen the colonel put down so much so fast.”\nThe Deliv gave an embarrassed shrug. “That new cook is really\nsomething. It was like drinking milk straight from the teats of the saint\nherself. Where’d you get him?”\nTamas swallowed. He felt a cold sweat on his brow. “What do you\nmean, ‘Where’d I get him?’ I’ve not hired a new cook.”\n“He said you appointed him head chef yourself,” Olem said. He put a\nhand out in front, miming a large belly, and took on an air of self-\nimportance. “ ‘… to fill the hearts, minds, and souls of the soldiers and give\nthem strength for the coming years.’ Or so he says.”\n“A fat man, this tall?” Tamas gestured above his head.\nOlem nodded.\n“Long black hair, looks like a Rosvelean?”\n“I thought he was a quarter Deliv,” Olem said. “But yes.”\n“You’re mad,” Sabon said. “He’s not got a drop of Deliv in him.”\n“Mihali,” Tamas said.\n“Yes, that was him,” Sabon confirmed. “A devil of a cook.”\n“Chef,” Tamas said distractedly. “And devil he may be. Find out who he\nis. Everything about him. He said his father was Moaka, the na baron of…\n‑\noh, something or another. Find out.” He would not have strange men\ninfiltrating his headquarters with nothing more than a lamb soufflé.\n“I’ll get right on that, sir,” Olem said.\n“Now!”"

Find out.” He would not have strange men\ninfiltrating his headquarters with nothing more than a lamb soufflé.\n“I’ll get right on that, sir,” Olem said.\n“Now!”\nOlem jumped. “Right away, sir.” He flicked his cigarette away and went\nfor the stairs. Tamas watched him go, then turned back to the slowly\napproaching longboat. He felt Sabon’s eyes on his back.\n“What?” he asked, more annoyance in his voice than he’d intended.\n“What the pit was that about?” Sabon said. “A lot of fuss for just a\ndamned cook.”\n“Chef,” Tamas said.\n“You think he’s a spy?”\n“I don’t know. That’s why I’m having Olem find out.”\n“What’s the good in having a bodyguard if you send him off when the\nKez show up?”\nTamas ignored the question. So Mihali hadn’t been a figment of his\nimagination. But what about what he had said? He’d warned Tamas to\ninvestigate the Privilegeds’ dying admonition—something he should have\nno knowledge about.\nTamas wasn’t a religious man. If he were to ascribe to any one belief, it\nwould probably be one most popular with upper society and philosophers\nthese days—that Kresimir had been a timepiece god. He’d come and set the\nNine in motion and had moved on, never to return.\nYet now the holy mountain itself rumbled in anger. What could this\nmean?\nSuperstitions. He couldn’t let them get the best of him. He’d have\nMihali arrested this very night, and that would be the end of it.\nThey watched the approaching longboat for a few minutes before Sabon\npointed down to the beach. “The rabble-rousers are here.”\n“About damn time.”\nThey headed down to the docks to join Tamas’s council. With aides,\nassistants, bodyguards, and footmen, it seemed like all of Adopest had\nturned out. Tamas missed the days when secrecy demanded that they meet\nin person: just seven men and a woman plotting to overthrow their king.\nThe members of his council gathered at the front of the group to meet\nhim on the boardwalk.\n“Tamas, my dear,” Lady Winceslav said as he approached. “Be so kind\nas to ask His Eminence and the other gentleman”—she gestured\ndisdainfully at the arch-diocel and the eunuch—“not to smoke so heavily\naround a lady.”\n“You could ask them yourself,” Tamas said.\n“She has,” Ricard said. “Seems His Holiness doesn’t know how to act\naround the ladies.”\nLady Winceslav harrumphed. “Sir, I don’t think you do either.”\nRicard removed his hat and gave her a bow. “I’m just a poor workin’\nman, marm. Excuse me.”\nThe arch-diocel and the eunuch both seemed to enjoy Lady Winceslav’s\ndiscomfort. Charlemund turned to Tamas, blowing smoke rings. “Did you\nknow this fellow had his manhood removed at birth? I didn’t know they still\npracticed such a thing, not for a thousand years.”\n“The Church favored castrati for their choirs up until fifty years ago,”"

    "text": "know this fellow had his manhood removed at birth? I didn’t know they still\npracticed such a thing, not for a thousand years.”\n“The Church favored castrati for their choirs up until fifty years ago,”\nOndraus said, looking over his book at the arch-diocel. He smirked. “There\nare still a few famous singers like Kirkham and Noubenhaus who are\ncastrati. They’re popular in cathedrals all about the Nine. I’m surprised you\ndidn’t know that.”\nThe arch-diocel puffed hard on his pipe.\n“It’s a common practice,” the eunuch said softly, his high-pitched voice\nnearly drowned out by the crash of the surf on the beach. “In my native land\nthere’s a whole caste of eunuchs, created at birth, who serve the Gurlan\nmagistrates. They serve in the harems and the magistrates’ courts and see to\ntheir every whim.” He eyed Lady Winceslav. “Every whim imaginable.”\n“Disgusting,” Lady Winceslav said, turning away.\nTamas watched the whole exchange without a word. Sometimes the\ncouncil seemed to amount to nothing more than children thrust together at a\nboarding school that has no thought for class or upbringing. They were a\nmotley assortment. “This is all quite interesting,” he said, “but the\nambassador is here. I’ll greet him myself. Alone. No doubt he’ll bring up\nthe Accords before he’s even off the boat. I’m going to tell him to stuff\nthem up his ass.”\n“I think he’d respond better to a lady’s charm,” Lady Winceslav said.\n“I bet you do,” the arch-diocel grunted. “I have nothing to say here. The\nChurch is neutral on matters of war in the Nine.”\n“Your unwavering support brings tears to my eyes,” Tamas said. “The\nKez will have demands. I prefer peace, if possible. The only question is\nhow hard we sue for it. The Accords are out completely. I’ll not have them\ntake this country from us. Ricard?”\n“War will bring trade on the Adsea to a crawl,” Ricard Tumblar said.\n“The union doesn’t like the idea. Then again, the factories will grind into\nfull use, employing thousands for munitions, clothes, and canned foods. It’ll\nbe a great boon to industry in Adopest. Between that and rebuilding the\ncity, we may completely solve unemployment in Adopest.”\n“Start a war to improve the economy,” Tamas murmured. “If only it\nwere so simple. Lady?”\n“My mercenaries are at your disposal.”\nUntil Adro ran out of land for her officers, Tamas supposed.\nThe eunuch shrugged. “My master has no opinion on war.”\n“Will he hold the gangs in check?” Tamas asked. “If Adopest goes to\nwar only to tear itself apart, things will be over before they start.”\nThe eunuch took a draw at his pipe. “The Proprietor will keep things…\nunder control.”\n“Vice-Chancellor?” Tamas said.\nThe old man looked wistfully off over the sea and trailed a finger across\nthe spiderlike birthmark on his face. “There hasn’t been a real war among\nthe Nine since the Bleakening.

I hope for peace but…” He wiped a hand\nacross his brow wearily. “Ipille is a greedy man. Do what must be done.”\nThe reeve was the last to speak. Ondraus pocketed his ledger and\nremoved the spectacles from his nose, folding them and putting them inside\nhis coat. “It’ll cost us more to pay the Kez back what Manhouch borrowed\nthan it will to run a war for two years. They can go to the pit.”\nSabon burst out laughing. Ricard and the eunuch grinned. Tamas\nswallowed a chuckle himself and nodded at the reeve. “Thank you for your\neducated opinion, sir.”\nTamas headed down the dock to greet the ambassador. He removed a\npowder charge from his pocket, gently unwrapped it, and sprinkled a bit on\nhis tongue. He felt the sizzle of power, the surge of awareness that came\nwith a powder trance, closing his eyes as he walked, one foot in front of the\nother, the dock boards creaking underneath him. He opened his eyes twenty\npaces from the boat.\nA small delegation disembarked. Wardens scrambled up to the dock and\nthen turned to help noblemen up, their sorcery-warped muscles moving like\nthick snakes beneath their coats. The Wardens were all big men, some\nnearly two heads taller than Tamas and each one worth ten soldiers in a\nbattle. Tamas shuddered.\nHe wouldn’t let himself be threatened. Whatever the Kez said in the\ncoming negotiations, he needed to keep a level head. They would menace\nand insult and he would take it in stride. War was not the best course here.\nHe would sue for peace, but not at the cost of his country.\nOne by one the delegation climbed onto the dock. There were a number of\nthem, all dressed in the finery of the nobility. He caught sight of a white\nPrivileged’s glove as it reached up and took the hand of a Warden. Only one\nsorcerer, his third eye told him. Tamas took a deep breath, reaching out with\nhis senses. This Privileged was not a powerful one, though such a thing was\nrelative when speaking of men who could destroy buildings with a gesture.\nThe Privileged stepped up onto the dock and straightened his jacket. He\nlaughed at something one of his delegation said and headed toward Tamas,\nalone.\nTamas gripped his hands behind his back to keep them from shaking.\nHe felt his heart thunder in his ears, his vision grow red in the corner of his\neyes. He shrugged Sabon’s hand from his shoulder.\nNikslaus.\nDuke Nikslaus was a small man, with the delicate hands of a Privileged\nand an overly large head that looked to wobble on his small frame. He wore\na short, furred cap and a black, buttonless coat. His stopped a foot from\nTamas and extended one hand, a smirk at the corners of his mouth.\n“It’s been so long, Tamas,” he said.\nTamas’s fingers tightened around the duke’s throat before he could even\nthink. Nikslaus’s eyes bulged, his mouth opening silently. Tamas lifted him,"

    "text": "“It’s been so long, Tamas,” he said.\nTamas’s fingers tightened around the duke’s throat before he could even\nthink. Nikslaus’s eyes bulged, his mouth opening silently. Tamas lifted him,\none-handed, from the dock planks. Nikslaus raised his hands, plucking at\nthe air. Tamas slapped them away before sorcery could be unleashed. He\nwas vaguely aware of Wardens running toward him, of his own bodyguard\napproaching hastily from behind, and of the cocking sound of Sabon’s\npistol. He shook Nikslaus hard.\n“Is this what Ipille sends to negotiate?” Tamas demanded. “Is this their\nwhite flag? I told you if you ever stepped foot in my country again, I would\nnail you to the spire of Sabletooth by your hands.”\n“War,” Nikslaus wheezed.\nTamas lightened his grip.\nNikslaus gasped. “You risk war!”\n“You dare come here?” Tamas said. “Ipille has declared war. He sent\nhis snake.” He threw Nikslaus to the dock. The duke squirmed along the\nplanks, crawling backward, his hands working silently. Tamas pointed at\nhim. “You try one thing and my Marked will gun you down.”\n“How dare you?” Nikslaus said. “This was in good faith!”\n“Eat your good faith, worm! Get out of my country. Tell Ipille to wipe\nhis ass with the Accords.”\n“This is war!” Nikslaus shrieked.\n“War!” Tamas pulled a handful of powder charges from his pocket,\ncrushing them in his hand. He ignited the powder as it fell, directed the\nenergy. The dock boards beneath Nikslaus exploded upward, throwing the\nduke into the air and head over heels into the water. The Wardens leapt in\nafter him, and Tamas spun around, ignoring Nikslaus’s sputtering cries for\nhelp.\n“What the pit was that?” the arch-diocel demanded.\nTamas stiff-armed him, throwing him to the ground. The rest of the\ncouncil stood aghast. He felt their stares on his back as he made his way up\nthe beach to the lighthouse. His ears, tuned from the powder trance, picked\nup Sabon’s voice.\n“Go easy on him,” Sabon told the council. “That was the man who\nbeheaded his wife.”\nAdamat pounded on the front doors of the Public Archives for twenty\nminutes until he heard the sound of bolts being drawn back. One of the big\ndoors opened and the lantern-lit face of a young woman stared back at him.\n“Library’s closed.” The door began to shut.\nAdamat put his foot in the door.\n“It’s three o’clock in the morning,” the woman said.\n“I need access to the Archives.”\n“Too bad. We’re closed.” She pushed the door open a little farther and\nthen jerked back until it crunched on Adamat’s foot.\n“Ow. SouSmith, if you please.”\nSouSmith leaned against the door. The woman stumbled backward,\nlantern swinging.\n“I’ll call the guards!” she said as Adamat stepped inside. He motioned\nSouSmith in and closed the door.\n“Don’t bother,” Adamat said. “I’ve got a writ from Field Marshal"

    "text": "“I’ll call the guards!” she said as Adamat stepped inside. He motioned\nSouSmith in and closed the door.\n“Don’t bother,” Adamat said. “I’ve got a writ from Field Marshal\nTamas.” He didn’t, but she didn’t know that. “I only need to do some\nresearch and I’ll be gone before you open in the morning.”\n“A writ? Let me see it.”\nNot for the first time in his investigation, Adamat felt a keen sense of\nloss that he’d had to send Faye away. She had many friends and would have\ngotten him into the Archives no matter the hour. Instead he was reduced to\nbullying his way in.\nAdamat peered at the woman. She was not what most people expected\nin a librarian. Her hair was down, curly and gold, and she was very young.\nAlmost too young. She couldn’t have been more than sixteen. “Who are\nyou?” he asked.\nShe drew herself up like one who was used to having to justify her\nauthority. “The night librarian! I tend the shelves and carry out research.”\n“Yes, well, miss, do you understand where the funding comes from for\nthe Public Archives?”\n“The king… oh. Grants from the nobili—oh.”\n“And do you think Field Marshal Tamas will be pleased about one of\nhis agents being turned away from research on which may rest the safety of\nthe state? Do you think he’ll stand up for funding for the Public Archives\nwhen his agent was so poorly treated? Funding that may end up going to\nanother library, say, to the Adopest University Library, which I know for a\nfact I’d have access to right now except that it’s very far out of my way.”\nEmployees given the night shift were often easily talked around. They\ntended not to be too bright. This one followed Adamat’s every word. He\ncould tell by her eyes. He was just lucky the argument made some sense.\n“All right,” she said. “But only for a few minutes.”\nAdamat followed her into the archives. A few lanterns hung from the\nwalls—but only enough to just light the way. Fire hazards were taken very\nseriously in libraries. He paused when they reached the tables.\n“You said you tend the shelves?”\n“That is one of the functions of a librarian.”\n“So you put away the books?”\n“Of course.”\n“Do you remember a pile of books on that table that was here about ten\ndays ago? The books would have been left out after Tamas retook the\nlibrary from the royalists.”\nShe rounded on him fast enough to make him take a step back.\n“Those books were vandalized,” she said, waving a finger under his\nnose. “Did you do that?”\nHe heard a snort of laughter from SouSmith. “No,” Adamat said with a\nsigh. “This is very important. Where are they?”\nShe didn’t drop her glare for a good thirty seconds. “This way,” she said\nprimly. “They’ve been taken to repair.”\nHe followed her into the back rooms of the library where a repair bench\nhad been set up in one corner. The bench was well worn, the wood polished\nfrom countless hours under a librarian’s behind. Stacks of broken and old\nbooks lay all around the bench ready to have covers or spines mended.\nAdamat recognized the books that Rozalia had been reading, all stacked"

    "text": "from countless hours under a librarian’s behind. Stacks of broken and old\nbooks lay all around the bench ready to have covers or spines mended.\nAdamat recognized the books that Rozalia had been reading, all stacked\nneatly near the end of the piles. Adamat sat on the bench and picked the\nfirst one up.\nWhen it became clear he wouldn’t actually be “only a moment,” the\nlibrarian reluctantly left him to his own devices. He sped through the\nparagraphs, though even with a perfect memory, reading was more than just\nglancing at the page. It was only when the room was just beginning to\nreceive light that wasn’t from the lantern, and he was on the fifth book, that\nhe was satisfied. He gathered three of them into his arms and woke\nSouSmith.\n“We’ve got to see Tamas,” Adamat said.\nThe Public Archives were only a twenty-minute walk from the House of\nNobles. Adamat was amazed as he went through the center of the city.\nRubble had been cleared from the main thoroughfares, buildings damaged\nby the quake had been pulled down, and preparations for rebuilding were\nunder way. The newspaper said that the Noble Warriors of Labor had\nemployed fifty thousand men and women to help with the reconstruction\nefforts.\nAdamat was ushered in to see the field marshal almost immediately.\nWhen they reached the top floor, Adamat was almost bowled over at the\ndoor. A young woman with dark hair and a powder mage’s keg pin on her\nbreast shoved past him. Her mouth was set in a hard line, her face red from\nyelling. Inside, the room was filled with people who looked like they\nwanted to be elsewhere. Adamat recognized two of Tamas’s councillors—\nthe city reeve and the vice-chancellor. Two men and a woman were\nbrigadiers of the Wings of Adom. A half-dozen Adran soldiers sat around a\ntable to one side, their ranks denoting captain or above.\nField Marshal Tamas sat behind the desk, his head in his hands. He\nlooked up when Adamat entered. He looked like he’d just been shouting at\nsomeone.\n“You have a report for me?” he asked in a surprisingly calm voice.\n“Yes.” He hefted the books in his arms. “And more.”\nTamas jerked his head toward the balcony. “Forgive me a moment,” he\ntold his officers.\nOutside, the sun was shining. The breeze made Adamat wish he’d worn\na thicker jacket. It was windier up here than at street level.\n“What do you have for me?”\nAdamat set the books aside. “Kresimir’s Promise.”\n“And?”\n“I’ve just returned from the South Pike Mountainwatch. There I\ninterviewed Privileged Borbador, the last remaining Privileged of\nManhouch’s royal cabal.”\n“Formerly of the royal cabal,” Tamas said. “He was exiled. Otherwise\nhe’d be buried in an unmarked grave with the rest.”\nAdamat grimaced. “We’ll get to that in a moment. When I mentioned\nthe Promise, Bo laughed at me. It’s an old legend, passed down among\nmembers of the royal cabal. It says that Kresimir promised the original\nkings of the Nine that their progeny would rule forever. If their lines were\ncut off, he would return himself and take vengeance.”"

    "text": "members of the royal cabal. It says that Kresimir promised the original\nkings of the Nine that their progeny would rule forever. If their lines were\ncut off, he would return himself and take vengeance.”\n“A fairy story meant to scare children,” Tamas said.\n“Bo said the same thing. The legend was perpetuated by the kings in\norder to keep the royal cabals in line. Their fear was that as soon as\nKresimir left, the Privileged would seize power themselves.”\n“I don’t see how it could be true. What educated man would take that\nseriously?”\n“Apparently the older members of the royal cabal.”\nTamas grunted at this.\n“It did get me thinking,” Adamat said. “Bo made a vague reference to\nthe notion that the kings had other ways to keep the royal cabals in line—\nsomething that would make Kresimir’s Promise unnecessary.”\nThis piqued Tamas’s interest. “Go on.”\nAdamat picked up one of the books. He found a page he’d marked, and\nhanded it to Tamas. When Tamas had finished reading, Adamat had another\npassage in a different book for him, then another in the third.\nTamas handed the last book back, his face troubled.\n“A gaes,” he said.\n“A compelling, of sorts. Every Royal Privileged has it. If the king is\nkilled, they are compelled to avenge him. It gets stronger and stronger over\ntime until they either succeed or it kills them out-right. The gaes is\nmanifested by a demon’s carbuncle—a large gem worn on the Privileged’s\nperson that they cannot take off. When I spoke with Bo, I saw him fiddling\nat a necklace repeatedly. And this.” He flipped to a different page in the\nthird book and handed it to Tamas.\nTamas scowled as he read. When he’d finished, he flipped the book shut\nand handed it back to Adamat. “So the gaes is permanent. Nothing can\nremove it, not even being exiled or removed from the royal cabal.”\n“Indeed. One other thing,” Adamat said. He quickly explained his\nrun in with Rozalia and the message she’d sent to Bo. “As soon as he heard\n‑\nthat message, he bolted back into the Mountainwatch. When I went to find\nhim to ask him what it meant, he refused to see me. I saw him head out of\nthe north gate of South Pike an hour later.”\n“The north gate…?” Tamas said.\n“The mountain gate. The one pilgrims use to reach the South Pike’s\npeak, where Kresimir first set foot on the mountain. It’s the only route up\nthere.”\nTamas leaned against the balcony railing and looked up toward the sun.\n“What do you think of all this?”\nAdamat had thought hard on this question the entire five-day journey\nback from South Pike. “I’m a reasonable man, sir. A modern man. While\nthe last words of sorcerers give me the chills, there’s no going around it.\nThe whole thing is rubbish. It smacks of religion. There’s a reason the royal\ncabals distanced themselves from the Kresim Church five hundred years\nago.”\n“I agree,” Tamas said. “And this thing with the gaes?”\n“There’s religion and then there’s sorcery. I confirmed this with"

I confirmed this with\nsecondary sources,” Adamat said, gesturing to the stack of books. “Sorcery\nis deadly serious.”\n“Looks like I can’t spare Borbador after all.” Pain crossed Tamas’s face\nquickly enough that Adamat thought he’d imagined it. Tamas gave him a\nlook up and down. “You’ve done a commendable job,” he said, offering his\nhand. “You went above and beyond what I asked.”\n“I’m sorry it came to nothing,” Adamat said, shaking the field marshal’s\nhand.\n“No need to be sorry about it. Better to know it’s nothing than to not\nknow it’s something. See the reeve about payment. I’ll make sure he’s not\nstingy. Good day.”\nTaniel jerked awake, a pistol in his hand. He struggled to focus on the\nfigure looming above him.\n“You’re going to blow a foot off sleeping with that.”\nTaniel sagged back to his bed and dropped the pistol on the floor.\n“What do you want?”\nTamas pulled the only chair over and sat down, kicking his boots up on\nthe edge of Taniel’s bed. “That’s no way to talk to your father.”\n“Go to the pit.”\nThere were a few moments of silence. Taniel could barely think. He’d\ntried not taking powder last night. He’d lasted until about two in the\nmorning before he went looking for his powder horn. Ka poel had hidden it,\n‑\nalong with his snuffbox full of powder and all his spare charges. His pistol\nwasn’t even loaded. Savage bitch. He’d just barely fallen asleep.\n“Vlora was looking for you.”\n“I don’t care.”\n“I wouldn’t tell her where you were.”\n“I don’t care.”\n“I threw Duke Nikslaus into the Adsea.”\nTaniel opened his eyes and sat up. His father was cleaning his nails. He\nlooked pleased with himself.\n“I think I’ve started a war,” Tamas said.\n“Should have blown his head off. The Adsea’s too good for him.”\nTamas took a deep breath. “No, a bullet is too good for him. I want that\nman to suffer. I want that man to feel humiliation. But I want it to last.”\nTaniel grunted his agreement.\n“It was calculated,” Tamas said.\n“What was?”\n“King Ipille sending Nikslaus. He wanted me angry. He wanted me to\nbeat him or kill him. He wanted an excuse to start a war.”\n“So did you. From the very beginning you wanted to go at them.”\n“I’ve been thinking,” Tamas said. “Over the last few months. I’ve been\nthinking that we should avoid war. Especially after the earthquake. We need\nto rebuild our country, feed our people. Too late now.”\n“Can we take them?” Taniel’s head was starting to clear. That wasn’t a\ngood thing. It pounded harder than a smith’s hammer.\n“Maybe,” Tamas said. “The Church is threatening to take sides. The\nKez side, more specifically. They didn’t like me throwing Nikslaus in the"

They didn’t like me throwing Nikslaus in the\nAdsea. That pompous bag Charlemund says he’s trying to convince them\notherwise. I believe him. I have to believe him. He was Adran before he\nbecame an arch-diocel, after all.”\nTaniel swung his legs out of bed and groaned. His body hurt. His head\nhurt. Whatever luck or sorcery or what-have-you that saved his life at the\nuniversity had not spared him the aches of the aftermath.\n“I have a new chef,” Tamas said.\nTaniel gave his father a long look. Why should he care? His whole body\nached. He just wanted powder, and Pole had hidden it all.\n“He says he’s Adom reborn,” Tamas went on. “I should have had him\narrested, but his cooking is too damned good. Rumor has it he’s been\nmaking food for half the regiments. Don’t know how he does it, but the\nmen like him. I’ve got a war about to start and a mad cook quickly\nbecoming the most popular man in the army. And…”\n“Out with it,” Taniel said.\n“Out with what?”\n“You’re rambling. You only ramble when you’re about to ask me to do\nsomething I won’t want to do.”\nTamas fell quiet. Taniel watched him struggle internally, emotion barely\ntouching his face. This was the first time he’d been alone with his father in\nwhat, four years? He noticed that Tamas was wearing the saw-handled\ndueling pistols he’d brought him from Fatrasta. They looked well used.\nTamas took a deep breath, his chuckle dying out, and stared at the\nceiling.\n“I need you to kill Bo.”\n“What?”\nTamas explained about the gaes. It was a long explanation, with a great\ndeal of technical detail. Taniel barely listened. There was something about\nan inspector and a promise. He could tell by his father’s tone that Tamas\ndidn’t want to say it. That it was duty alone that forced his hand.\n“Why me?” he asked when his father finally fell silent.\n“If Sabon had to die, I’d give him the courtesy of doing it myself. I’d\nfeel like a coward if I had someone else do it.”\n“And you think I can kill my best friend?”\n“Bo’s very strong, I know. I’ll send help with you.”\n“That’s not what I meant. I know I can shoot him. I can probably get\nclose enough without him expecting a thing to do it with a pistol. But do\nyou really think I can bring myself to do it?”\n“Can you?”\nTaniel looked at his hands. He’d last seen Bo over two years ago, the\nday he’d gotten on the ship for Fatrasta. Bo had been there to see him off.\nYet what was another friend? The world was different now. He’d killed\ndozens of men. His fiancée had bedded another man. His country no longer\nhad a king. Who was to say Bo had remained the same?\nTaniel squeezed his hands into fists. How dare he? How dare Tamas"

Taniel was a soldier, but he was also Tamas’s\nson. Did that even matter? “I won’t do it if you ask me,” Taniel said. “Not if\nyou ask me as a son. If you give me an order as a powder mage—then I’ll\ndo it.”\nTamas’s face hardened. This was a challenge, and he knew it. Taniel’s\nfather didn’t take well to challenges. Tamas stood up.\n“Captain, I want you to kill Privileged Borbador at the South Pike\nMountainwatch. Bring me back the jewel he has on his person as evidence.”\nTaniel closed his eyes. “Yes, sir.” That son of a bitch. He was really\ngoing to make Taniel kill his best friend. Taniel wondered if he should\ncome back and put a bullet in Tamas’s head once he’d finished with Bo.\n“I’m sending Julene with you.”\nHis eyes snapped open. “No. I won’t work with her.”\n“Why not?”\n“She’s reckless. She got her partner killed, and nearly me too.”\n“She said the same thing about you.”\n“And you’d believe her over me?”\n“She had the courtesy to report to me after you so freely let the enemy\ngo.”\n“That Privileged would have killed us all,” Taniel said.\n“I’ve given the order.” Tamas turned around, headed for the door.\n“Marked Taniel, carry out your orders. Then you’ll need some time off to\ndeal with your… personal problems.” He left.\nPersonal problems? Taniel sneered. He felt something on his arm,\nlooked down. His nose was practically pouring blood. He swore, looking\naround for a towel. What would help this? Oh yes, some black powder…\nChapter 15\nThere was a room beneath the House of Nobles, deeper underground than\neven the sewer systems, that had seen its heyday during the reign of the Iron\nKing. Privileged sorceries held back the musky scent and the darkness and\nkept the walls from leaking even after the deaths of the men who cast the\nspells. The room was fifty paces wide, ten paces high, white plaster walls\ncovered in wall hangings long thought lost by those who care about such\nthings. There were tables and chairs, lounges that could be used as beds,\ncrates of canned food, and barrels of water hidden behind silk curtains.\nNot even Manhouch had known about his father’s emergency shelter;\nonly a few of the Iron King’s closest advisers, Tamas included, knew about\nthe place, or how to reach it beneath the House of Nobles. The Iron King\nhad been paranoid that the people would rise up against him, or that his\nspies would turn their knives to his throat. Tamas thought it fitting, then,\nwhen it was clear that the place had been in complete disuse since\nManhouch XII took the throne, that it should be used to plot the king’s fall.\nSince the coup, Tamas’s council of coconspirators had moved their\nmeetings to a less wayward place, far above on the third floor of the House\nof Nobles, as befitting a government, but Tamas still used the room as a"

    "text": "meetings to a less wayward place, far above on the third floor of the House\nof Nobles, as befitting a government, but Tamas still used the room as a\nplace to find quiet and solitude. None of his staff knew where to find him\nhere, not even Olem and Sabon. He would head back up soon enough.\nTamas sat in the most comfortable of the chairs, his stockinged feet up\non a hassock, a bowl of squash soup in his lap—the only thing Mihali\nwould let him have from the kitchens when he passed through—and a\nminiature map of Surkov’s Alley in his hand. The other hand gently\nscratched the head of one of his hounds, receiving a periodic lick of\naffection for his troubles.\nHe examined the map closely. It had been three days since he’d thrown\nDuke Nikslaus into the Adsea. It was a three-day ride, trading horses and\nwithout sleep, from Surkov Alley—the thin valley through the mountains\nconnecting Adro and Kez—to Adopest. Tamas had received word not an\nhour ago that the Kez army was gathering outside of Budwiel, the city on\nthe border of Kez at the entrance to Surkov Alley.\nNikslaus and the delegation was a feint, an excuse for a war Ipille had\nbanked on. Preparations had already begun. The Kez meant to invade. Yet it\nwould take them a hundred thousand men to break through Surkov’s Alley.\nThe whole corridor was staggered with troops and artillery placements.\nUnless Surkov’s wasn’t their target.\nHe set the map down and repositioned his bowl of soup to a nearby\ntable. Pitlaugh crept away with a light growl. “Hush,” he told the hound.\nTamas fetched a bigger map, this one of all south Adro, and looked it over.\nSouth Pike was the only mountain pass big enough for the Kez to bring\na whole army through without it taking all summer. Could they be trying\nfor that? Would their commanders decide that the smaller choke point with\nfewer men was a better target than Surkov’s Alley? He glanced at the\nbottom of the Adsea on the map, where one small corner of it touched the\nonly Adsea harbor in Kez beside the river delta. They might try coming\nover water, but the Kez had hardly any navy to speak of in the Adsea.\nTamas sighed, folding the map, and sat back in his chair. He looked down\nat Hrusch. The hound gazed back up at him, head tilted to the side, panting\njowls forming a smile.\nWhat could Ipille possibly be thinking? Kez outnumbered Adro five to\none in soldiers, yet Adro had so many advantages: industry, more capable\nmilitary commanders, the Mountainwatch. Adro held all the choke points.\n“I should bring Olem down here,” Tamas said to the dog. “I think better\nwhen I have someone to muse to.” Then the place would smell of his\ncigarettes. Tamas leaned over for a spoonful of Mihali’s soup. He’d never\ntasted anything like it, milky sweet with a hint of dark sugar.\nTamas heard a click on the other side of the room, near the door.

The\nhallways leading to the room formed a series of dead-end corridors and\nfalse walls, switchbacks and trap doors, enough to confound and discourage\neven a determined individual, so it was with some surprise that Tamas sat\nup and pulled on his boots. He stood up and turned toward the door,\nstraightening his shirt, a hand out to silence Hrusch’s whines.\nTamas’s heart beat faster at the sight of the creature that stepped\nthrough the door. It was a man, or had been at one time. He wore a long,\ndark jacket and a stovepipe top hat, though those were hardly enough to\nconceal his deformities. He was a hunchback with thick, powerful arms and\nlegs. His face was almost handsome, but for an overlarge, misshapen brow.\nHe had no facial hair, and lank blond hair fell down either side of his head.\n“Warden,” Tamas said, surprised at the evenness in his own voice.\nWardens were often used as errand boys for Kez Privileged, but their\ncreation so many hundreds of years ago by the Kez royal cabal had a single\npurpose: to kill powder mages.\nTamas had no pistol or rifle with him. His sword remained, but he knew\nwhat little good those did against a Warden. He was a fool for going\nanywhere without a guard, even in the most secure place in all of Adro. He\nchecked his pockets. No powder charges, not even his fine cigar box with\nfalse, powder-filled cigars. Those were in his jacket. Across the room,\nhanging on a coatrack next to the Warden.\nThe Warden perused the room carefully, sure that they were alone,\nbefore he removed his hat and hung it from the coatrack. His jacket and\nthen his shirt and bow tie followed, leaving him in a pair of black pants. He\ntook off his shoes, a grin spreading across his face as he did so.\nMuscles moved on their own accord under his skin, tightening and\nloosening, sometimes jumping in spasms. They writhed in tight balls in\nsome places, while they seemed hardly present in others, the skin tight\nagainst the bone, and then it would all shift and change again. It was like\nwatching a mass of snakes inside a bag of silk.\nThe Warden flexed his shifting muscles and stretched. “Mage,” he said.\nHis voice was deep, vibrant.\n“That’s quite the shit-eating grin,” Tamas said. He took his sword belt\nfrom where he’d hung it on the back of his chair and drew the sword,\ntossing the sheath aside. Pitlaugh stood beside him, and the old wolfhound\nhad teeth bared, growling dangerously. Hrusch retreated behind a sofa,\ngrowling at the Warden from perceived safety.\n“It’s not often I’m given a powder mage so cleanly,” the Warden said.\n“Nor one with such a reputation. I usually have to eat the dregs the\nsorcerers can comb from the Kez countryside.”\nEat? Tamas felt vaguely sick.\nThe Warden smiled. He stretched out his arms as if to embrace Tamas\nfrom across the room, the warped limbs long enough to wrap around a\nmortar barrel."

He stretched out his arms as if to embrace Tamas\nfrom across the room, the warped limbs long enough to wrap around a\nmortar barrel.\n“How did you find me?” Tamas asked. He stepped away from his chair\nand held his sword out to the side. Pitlaugh moved between Tamas and the\nWarden, and a vision went through Tamas’s mind of the Warden tearing\napart his hounds. “Pitlaugh,” he said. “Back.”\nThe wolfhound backed down reluctantly, giving Tamas and the Warden\na wide berth.\nThe Warden shook his head, the grin still on his face. “I won’t risk you\nsurviving this.” He cracked the knuckles of one enormous, malformed hand.\n“But I will let you die with the knowledge that every one of your precious\nmages will be hunted down and devoured, body and soul.”\nThe Warden bent his head like a fighting bull and charged. Thirty paces\nseparated them, yet the creature covered that space in hardly any time at all,\none big hand reaching out to grab a hassock as he came, flinging the\nfurniture at Tamas as if it were a toy.\nTamas ducked the hassock and sidestepped the Warden. He aimed for\nthe heart with his blade, striking hard. A meaty fist pounded into the side of\nhis head, sending him stumbling across the room.\nThe Warden didn’t give him a chance to recover. He changed directions\nin a split second and flung himself toward Tamas, ignoring the sword aimed\nat his chest. Tamas jabbed with all his might, then threw himself out of the\nway of the Warden’s bulk. He ducked, rolling on one shoulder and to his\nfeet.\nBlood oozed from the two punctures on the Warden’s chest. Tamas\nmust have hit a lung and the stomach, but the creature smiled at him\nhungrily with no regard for the wounds. Wardens’ hearts were protected by\na shell of sorcerously grown bones, and Privileged sorceries could keep a\nWarden’s other organs working when they should have long been dead.\nThe Warden charged once more. Tamas danced to the side for a\nslashing blow, but one big hand reached out for him. He ducked under the\narm and struck from behind, thrusting his sword into the Warden’s armpit\nuntil the hilt touched skin.\nThe Warden howled and jerked away, ripping the sword from Tamas’s\ngrip. Tamas’s heart thumped in his ears and his hands shook.\nThe Warden thrashed about for several moments before suddenly falling\nstill. His dark gaze was hooded by his overlarge brow, blue eyes beady and\nbloodshot. His right arm hung loosely at his side, muscles nearly concealing\nthe hilt. The blade of the sword stuck out of his chest, three handspan’s\nworth of steel. The Warden looked down on it disdainfully. He reached\nacross with his left hand and tried to pull out the sword. The angle made it\nimpossible for him.\n“You’ve something in your chest,” Tamas said, though he didn’t have\nmuch energy behind the jibe. His lungs burned from the effort he’d just"

His lungs burned from the effort he’d just\nexerted, his muscles ached. He eyed his coat on the other side of the room.\nHe could sense the powder charges in the pocket.\nThe Warden leapt toward him suddenly, throwing his body like a\nflopping fish. Tamas reeled back, trying to get out of his range, but felt the\nWarden’s fingers catch the front of his shirt. He was pulled into an\nembrace, his neck a mere finger from his own sword blade where it stuck\nfrom the Warden’s chest. He felt hot, angry breath on his cheek and smelled\nthe scent of bile reeking from the creature.\nTamas struck the Warden in the eyes with one hand. The creature\nbellowed like an injured bear, wrestling one-armed with Tamas, dragging\nTamas’s chest across his own blade before tossing him across the room.\nTamas caught himself on a sofa and pulled himself up. He spotted the\ncoatrack nearby and ran for it. “Pitlaugh! Kill!”\nThe wolfhound darted toward the Warden, ten stone of angry teeth and\nmuscle. Pitlaugh snaked around to the Warden’s wounded arm and lunged\nfor the throat. The Warden managed to turn away, and Pitlaugh’s teeth sank\ninto the Warden’s arm.\nTamas reached the coatrack and threw the Warden’s clothes to the floor,\nsnatching at his own jacket. He brought out his cigar case and flung it open,\nrevealing the six carefully wrapped cigars within. He bit the end off one,\nemptying the secret stash of powder into his mouth. He felt the bitter burn\nof sulfur on his tongue, then the nausea that came with taking so much\npowder so quickly. He staggered.\nTamas’s head whipped around at a sharp whine. Pitlaugh had been\nthrown to the floor. Something was wrong with his back legs and he tried to\ncrawl away from the Warden, whimpering loudly. The sound broke\nTamas’s heart, and something inside him snapped. The powder trance took\nhim over completely.\nTamas crossed the room in a few long strides, barely registering the\ndistance. The Warden threw a punch with his good arm. Tamas grabbed the\nfist out of the air and ignited one of his false cigars, channeling the power.\nA bone in the Warden’s arm snapped.\nTamas, still holding the Warden’s now-limp hand, twisted. The Warden\nwas lifted onto his toes. His eyes were big, his mouth warped in a silent\nscream. Tamas grabbed the sword hilt with one hand and yanked, sliding it\nin and out, feeling it scrape against bone inside the creature’s body. He\nripped the sword from the wound and dropped it, letting it clatter to the\nstone floor.\nThe Warden bared his teeth in a mad smile and threw himself headfirst\ntoward Tamas. Even in such agony, the creature would not back down.\nTamas caught the big head with both hands. He lifted the creature easily\nwith the strength provided by the powder trance.

He twisted the head and\nslammed it into the marble floor, hearing stones crack beneath. He ignited\none of the fake cigars in his pocket and shot the energy into the Warden’s\nbrain.\nThe body slumped beneath him, dead.\nTamas staggered away from the creature. His head was light, his energy\nspent. His body was soaked in blood and he wasn’t even sure how much of\nit was his. The cuts on his chest were deep enough to need stitches and\nsomewhere outside the powder trance, distantly, he could feel them\nburning. His wrists and arms hurt, old bones not used to the power he’d\nunleashed. He took a deep breath, his eyes falling on Pitlaugh.\nThe old wolfhound lay on the corner of a rug. Hrusch emerged from his\nhiding place behind a divan and approached Pitlaugh, whining lightly,\nnuzzling him. Pitlaugh’s back was twisted sharply, his rear legs sticking off\nat an odd angle. He opened his eyes as Tamas gazed upon him, looking up\npitifully.\n“You did well, boy,” Tamas said softly. He stepped toward the door,\nthen stopped when Pitlaugh tried to follow, dragging his legs behind him,\nwhining loudly. Tamas felt his eyes burn.\nIt took him some time to reach the upper levels of the House of Nobles\ncarrying Pitlaugh. Tamas found Dr. Petrik playing cards with some officers\non the second floor. They stared at him as he entered the room, covered in\nblood, the wolfhound in his arms, Hrusch close on his heels.\nSome time later Pitlaugh lay stretched out on a sofa. Petrik examined\nhim while dozens of soldiers crowded the doorway, trying to see inside the\nroom. A few loud curses made them move out of the way, then Olem\nappeared. He froze when he saw Tamas. Olem’s face was red, his eyes\nwide.\n“Sir,” Olem said. His hands shook as he reached out to touch Tamas, as\nif making sure he was still alive. He wouldn’t look into Tamas’s eyes. “I’ve\nfailed you,” he said.\n“It’s not your fault,” Tamas said. “You couldn’t have known. I slipped\noff.”\n“I should have been there.” Olem’s gaze fell on Pitlaugh. “I’m sorry,\nsir. By Kresimir, I…”\n“You never failed,” Tamas said firmly. “You weren’t even there. Now I\nneed you close by. Get messengers. I want every member of the council\nhere within the hour. I don’t give a damn if they have to sprout wings to do\nit. Go. I want them to meet me in the room beneath the House of Nobles.”\nDr. Petrik approached. “There’s nothing I can do for him. Not even a\nskilled veterinarian could help him now.”\n“Of course. Thank you, Doctor.”\nTamas took a pistol from Olem and went to the dog’s side. He ran his\nfingers gently between Pitlaugh’s eyes. “It’s all right, boy. Have peace.”\nHe felt something jolt inside him when the shot rang through the room."

Have peace.”\nHe felt something jolt inside him when the shot rang through the room.\nHe knelt by Pitlaugh’s side for a few minutes, ignoring the commotion of\nguards checking on the pistol shot.\nTamas got to his feet and picked out a soldier at random. “Find me a\nhammer and spikes. Now.”\nIn the room below the House of Nobles, Tamas waited. He stared at the\nWarden’s broken body. These things were strong and difficult to kill, but\nthe Kez had to know that Tamas could deal with one. It was only bad luck\nhe’d not had powder on him when he was attacked. What was the purpose?\nTo sow distrust? To bring chaos into Tamas’s inner circle?\nIf that was their aim, they’d succeeded.\nHis council came in, one by one, and he directed them to chairs on one\nside of the room, ignoring protests and questions until every one of them\nhad arrived. He stood before them, hands folded, still in his blood-covered\nshirt. The Warden hung from the wall behind him by a spike in one wrist,\ncrimson drops falling from his body to splatter on the stones below.\n“One of you has betrayed me,” Tamas said. “I will find out who.”\nHe left them there to contemplate the Warden’s corpse.\nAdamat felt a shadow fall across his shoulders and sensed a man standing\nover him. He touched the cane leaning against his knee and set his tea on\nthe iron café table. He watched the shadow for a moment, remembered the\nsound the fall of approaching boots had made on the cobbles, and moved\nhis hand away from the cane.\n“Field Marshal,” Adamat said without looking up.\nTamas tossed a newspaper down next to Adamat’s tea and took the seat\nopposite. He held up his hand for a waiter.\n“How’d you know it was me?”\n“Military boots, military step,” Adamat said, taking a sip of his tea.\n“I’ve not done work for anyone else in the military in ten years.”\n“It could have been an aide, sent to find you.”\nAdamat shrugged. “Each person has a particular cadence to their step.\nYours is well defined.”\n“Fascinating. I trust Ondraus gave you enough money to help with your\ndebts?”\nAdamat wasn’t surprised that Tamas knew he had debt problems.\nAdamat made a quick study of the field marshal; there were bruises on his\nface, a few cuts. It looked like he’d been in a fistfight. He looked tired,\nspent.\n“Certainly,” Adamat said. Though not enough, he thought. If he\nreceived a dozen good jobs by the end of the month, he might be able to pay\nLord Vetas. “I appreciate your generosity.”\n“Well worth it.” Tamas spoke quietly, his neck craned to watch people\npassing in the street. He turned away from the street after a few moments of\nsilence and drew an envelope from his jacket. He set it on the table, on top\nof the newspaper.\n“I have another job for you,” he said.\nAdamat did his best to conceal his eagerness. “Not the dying words of a\nsorcerer again, I hope?”\n“Not yet.” Tamas thanked the waiter who brought him his tea.

He drank\nit in one long sip, not seeming to notice the heat of it. When he finished, he\nremoved a handful of coins from his pocket. He grunted in disgust at what\nhe saw, then tossed a coin on the table.\n“Find out who’s trying to kill me.”\nHe stood and left. Adamat looked down at the coin. It had a likeness of\nTamas’s silhouette on the front.\nAdamat took the envelope, tapping it against the tabletop. He flipped\nover the newspaper. The Adopest Daily. “the attempt on the life of field\nmarshal tamas.”\nHe gazed at the envelope. He needed the work. Yet this was dangerous.\nIt gave Lord Vetas every reason to come back, looking to blackmail\nAdamat into telling him about Tamas’s inner circle. It also put Adamat—\nand his family—in danger from the traitor. He’d planned on summoning\nFaye back to Adopest. That wouldn’t do now… not yet.\nHe opened the envelope. Within was a check for ten thousand krana. A\nsmall, folded bit of paper fell on the tabletop. He snatched it up before a\nbreeze could blow it away.\n“ ‘Six people other than me knew the location of the room in which the\nattempt was made on my life.’” A list of names followed, the names of\nTamas’s council. Adamat wiped sweat from his brow as he read over the\nnames a second time and wondered if ten thousand krana was enough. At\nthe end of the note, there were simply two words: “Acquire protection.”\nAdamat pushed the check and the note into his pocket and decided he’d\nreleased SouSmith from his employ a little too early.\nChapter 16\nSir, we’ve found out who Mihali is.”\nTamas looked up from his desk. For once, things were quiet. Not a\nWings brigadier or a councillor or officer or secretary in sight. Olem was\nthe first person Tamas had seen all morning, though he’d been stationed just\noutside the door.\n“Mihali?”\nOlem paused to light a cigarette. “The new chef.”\nTamas remembered the bowl of squash soup in the corner of his desk. It\nwas regrettably empty. The stuff was as addictive as black powder. “Yes…\nMihali,” Tamas said. “It took you long enough.”\n“It’s been a distracting week.”\n“That’s fair.”\n“Mihali is the na baron of Moaka,” Olem said. “He’s more commonly\n‑\nknown by his professional title: Lord of the Golden Chefs.”\n“And what does that mean?”\n“The Golden Chefs is a culinary institute. The finest in the Nine.\nGraduates of their schools are coveted by the wealthiest families on four\ncontinents as private chefs. They cook for kings.”\n“And their lord?”\n“A man considered the greatest among peers each generation.”\n“He’s in our kitchens, making lunch for three regiments?”\n“Quite right, sir.”\n“Why?” Tamas asked.\n“It seems he’s hiding.”\nTamas stared at Olem. “Hiding?”\n“He’s only recently escaped from Hassenbur Asylum.”"

He glanced down at his work. There\nwere requests on his desk from the Adopest Kennel Society, writs to be\nsigned for Ricard Tumblar’s union, and a proposed tax on the Kresim\nChurch. He shook his head. Nothing he wanted to deal with now. “Let’s go\nhave a chat with our chef, then, shall we?”\nOlem followed him out into the hall. “Do you think that’s wise, sir?”\n“Is he dangerous?” Tamas asked.\n“Not as far as I can tell. The men love him. They’ve never had someone\ncook like this for them before. Makes all the other army rations taste like\nshit.”\n“What’s he making? Squash soup?”\nOlem laughed. “Remember what you had for lunch yesterday?”\n“Of course I do,” Tamas said. “It was a bloody nine-course meal.\nCandied eel, stuffed dormouse, braised beef, a salad big enough to feed an\nox… I’ve eaten that well only once before in my life and it was at one of\nManhouch’s parties.”\n“That was normal ration, sir.”\nOlem bumped into him when Tamas came to a complete stop. “You\nmean everyone is eating that well?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“You?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“The whole damned brigade?”\nOlem nodded.\n“He must be blowing through the entire year’s ration budget.” Tamas\nresumed walking, feeling some urgency in his step. “Ondraus is going to\nshit a paving stone.”\nOlem caught up. “On the contrary, sir. I asked a secretary. It seems he’s\nnot even touched the main fund.”\n“Then how is he paying for all that food?”\nOlem shrugged.\nOne kitchen served the entirety of the House of Nobles. It was located\njust beneath the main floor so that windows high up one of the walls could\nprovide light during the day, and was nearly as long as the House was wide.\nAlong one side of the kitchen ran dozens of ovens with flues that\ndisappeared into the ceiling and enough cooking space to prepare food for\nthe thousands of secretaries and nobles that would normally have filled the\nbuilding. The middle of the floor contained broad, low tables to prepare\nrecipes and to ready ingredients, and the other side contained hutches and\ncupboards by the score with measuring instruments, spices, and other\ningredients. Sausages, herbs, vegetables, and more hung from the ceiling.\nTamas patted his forehead with a handkerchief the moment he entered\nthe room. The heat nearly sent him retreating out into the hall. He blinked a\nfew times and held his ground, partially urged on by the myriad of smells:\nscents of cocoa and cinnamon and of breads and meats. His mouth began to\nwater."

His mouth began to\nwater.\n“Are you all right, sir?” Olem asked.\nTamas shot him a look.\nThe room bustled with dozens of assistants. They all wore a variation of\nthe same uniform: a white apron over black pants, and some kind of hat\nupon their head. Some of them seemed to be able to afford to acquire better\nquality, while others looked to have scrounged their outfits from the street.\nTamas did notice that no matter how frayed, all the clothing was clean. He\nnoticed another thing: Every one of the assistants was a woman. They\nvaried in age and beauty and all worked with utmost concentration. None\nseemed to notice Tamas’s presence.\nThe chef himself paced among his assistants. Tamas recognized him\nimmediately as the man who’d appeared at his headquarters the day of the\nearthquake. As Tamas watched, Mihali stopped to say something to one of\nhis assistants and then immediately moved on to the next, adding a dash of\nthis spice to that dish and gently grabbing the arm of an assistant before too\nmuch flour could be added to a dough. He had set the women up in\nworkstations, and he danced between them with the skill of a line\ncommander, issuing orders and making changes to the recipes as he went,\nalways seeming to have an eye on everything at once.\nMihali caught sight of Tamas and smiled. He headed toward the door,\nonly to stop halfway there at a counter of meats and help a hefty-sized\nwoman with her aim at the cleaver. He lopped off a dozen ribs of beef with\nthe precision of a headsman and then nodded to the woman, handing back\nthe cleaver. He whispered something reassuring and made his way over to\nTamas.\n“Good afternoon, Field Marshal,” Mihali said. “Been a busy couple of\nweeks since we met.”\nOlem gave Tamas a curious look at this.\nMihali went on, “I’ll tell you, I’d work twice as fast if I wasn’t training\na whole batch of new assistants.” He removed his hat and dragged a sleeve\nacross his forehead, staining the cloth with sweat, before wiping his hands\non his apron. A look of worry crossed his face. “Lunch will be a few\nminutes late, I’m afraid.”\nTamas glanced across the room. So much was going on that it was\nimpossible to tell what was actually being prepared. He’d been ready to\ncome down here asking questions. He wanted to get to the bottom of this\n“mad chef” business. Yet his words died on his tongue.\n“I doubt anyone will complain,” Tamas managed. His stomach rumbled\nsuddenly. “What’s for lunch?”\n“Blackened salamander with curry and a light vegetable pie,” Mihali\nsaid. “We’re having wine-glazed beef back for dinner tonight, and I thought\nI’d serve a spiced wine with it. Main courses only. There will be plenty of\nother things to choose from.”\n“To everyone in the House?”\n“Of course.” Mihali’s eyes went wide, as if Tamas had suggested\nsomething idiotic. “Do you think a secretary deserves to eat any less well\nthan a field marshal, or a soldier than an accountant?”"

He shared a glance with Olem, trying to\nremember why he came down.\n“Please, Field Marshal, walk with me.” Mihali hurried away without\nwaiting for an answer. When Tamas caught up, Mihali was adjusting the\nheat beneath a vat of soup by changing the airflow in the stove beneath it.\nHe dipped one finger in the soup and popped it in his mouth, before\nproducing a knife and a clove of garlic from his apron, deftly slicing a\nmeasure into the vat.\n“I heard about the attempt on your life,” Mihali said.\nTamas stopped. He realized the pain of his wounds, the ache of the\nstitches on his chest, had faded to nothing when he entered the kitchen.\nThey were a distant throb, as if from outside a powder trance.\nMihali had a note of sadness to his voice. “I do not agree with what the\nsorcerers do to those Wardens. It’s unnatural. I’m glad you survived.”\n“Thank you,” Tamas said slowly. His suspicions that Mihali was a spy\nwere slowly fading. His reputation and skills as a chef couldn’t be faked.\n“Mihali,” Tamas said, “I came to ask you about the asylum.”\nMihali froze, a forkful of vegetable pie halfway to his mouth. He\nfinished the bite off quickly. “More pepper,” he told an assistant, “and add a\ndozen more potatoes to the next batch.” He hurried on to the next station,\nforcing Tamas to catch up.\n“Yes,” he said when Tamas was alongside him again, “I escaped from\nHassenbur. It was a vile place.”\n“How did you escape?”\nThey had reached a portion of the kitchens where there weren’t any\nassistants. In fact, it was as if an invisible curtain had been drawn across it.\nThe heat and steam had lessened, and the noise had become muffled. Tamas\nglanced over his shoulder to be sure that they were still in the same room.\nBehind him, the flurry of activity continued.\n“They gave me access to the kitchens when I wasn’t being treated.”\nMihali shivered at a memory. “And though they said I was cooking for the\nasylum, I soon found out they were sending my meals to the manor homes\nof nearby nobles and selling my services for quite a bit of money. I baked\nmyself into a cake and had my assistants send me to the next manor over.”\n“You’re joking,” Olem said. He rolled an unlit cigarette around between\nhis lips and eyed a stove.\nMihali shrugged. “It was a very big cake.”\nTamas waited for him to say something else, perhaps his real method of\nescape, but Mihali remained quiet. This section of the kitchen, nearly half\nof the space of the whole, contained just as many cookpots and fired ovens\nas the other, but as Mihali moved from one dish to the next, it was clear he\nwas the only one attending these.

    "text": "as the other, but as Mihali moved from one dish to the next, it was clear he\nwas the only one attending these. Mihali reached above his head and pulled\ndown an enormous pot from its hook. It looked to weigh as much as Tamas,\nbut Mihali handled it with ease, maneuvering it down onto a stove. He\nopened the fire chamber beneath the stove, checking the heat, before\nmoving on to an open spit in the corner.\nTamas followed him across the room. He paused beside the pot Mihali\nhad just pulled down—steam rose from it. He stepped forward and blinked.\nThe pot was full to the brim with a thick stew of potatoes, carrots, corn, and\nbeef.\n“Wasn’t that empty a moment ago?” Tamas asked Olem quietly.\nOlem frowned. “It was.”\nThey both looked about for the pot Mihali had just pulled down, but all\nthe pots on this side of the kitchen were full and cooking. Tamas felt less\nhungry somehow, and more uneasy. Mihali was still at the spit. A whole\nside of beef roasted above the flames. Mihali lifted a small bowl and began\npouring some kind of dressing over the meat. Tamas found his stomach\ngrowling again, his uneasiness gone with the advent of new smells.\n“Mihali, have you told other people that you are the god Adom\nreincarnated?” Tamas examined Mihali’s face intently, looking for signs of\nmadness. There was no question that Mihali was a maestro of the kitchens.\nTamas had heard that every genius was equal parts madness. He tried to\nremember his childhood theology lessons. Adom was the patron saint of\nAdro. The church called him Kresimir’s brother, but not a god like\nKresimir.\nMihali poked the side of beef with the tip of his knife and watched\ngrease bubble to the surface and run down the meat, sizzling on the coals\nbelow. His frown slowly returned. “My relatives had me committed,” he\nsaid quietly. “My brothers and cousins. I’m a bastard son—my mother was\na Rosvelean beauty whom my father loved more than his wife, and my\nbrothers have therefore hated me since I was a boy. Father protected me and\nfostered my talents. Against custom, he made me his heir.” He prodded the\nside of beef once more. “My brothers sent me to the asylum the day he died.\nI wasn’t allowed to attend the funeral. My claims to be the god Adom were\nonly an excuse.”\nMihali stood up straight suddenly, as if stirred from slumber. “Bread,\nbread,” he muttered. “Another fifty loaves at least. These girls don’t work\nfast enough.”\nHe moved to the counters in the middle of the room. There were lumps\nof dough beneath damp towels. He whisked away the towels with one hand\nand plunged the other hand into the great mounds of dough. “Risen\nperfectly,” he said to himself, a distracted smile on his face. He divided the\ndough into perfect portions, his hands working so quickly Tamas could\nbarely follow. Two loaves at a time were loaded onto the bread paddle and\nscooped into a waiting oven, until all the dough was gone."

Two loaves at a time were loaded onto the bread paddle and\nscooped into a waiting oven, until all the dough was gone.\nWhen the last loaf was loaded in the oven, he immediately removed the\nfirst. It was golden brown, the crust crisp and flaky, though it had only been\na minute or two since it went in. Tamas narrowed his eyes and began to\ncount.\n“That’s not my imagination,” Tamas said, leaning toward Olem.\n“No,” Olem confirmed. “He put a quarter that many loaves into the\noven.” Olem made the sign of the Rope, touching two fingers together and\nthen to his forehead and his chest. “Kresimir above. Have you ever heard of\nsorcery that can create something out of nothing?”\n“Never. But I’m seeing a lot of new things these days.”\nMihali finished removing the last of the loaves from the oven. He turned\nto Tamas and Olem. “Hassenbur has sent men for me,” Mihali said. “I\nwould sooner flee to the far side of Fatrasta and cook for the savages than\nreturn to Hassenbur Asylum.”\nTamas pulled his eyes off the loaves. He looked at the cooked side of\nbeef and the pot of stew that had been empty not ten minutes before. He\nnodded at Mihali’s words and moved away slowly, Olem at his side.\n“A Knack,” Olem said. “That’s the only explanation. I’ve heard of\nKnacks stronger than any Privileged sorcery. His must have to do with\nfood.”\n“Third eye?” Tamas asked.\nOlem nodded. “Just did. He has the glow of a Knacked.”\n“Well, he’s no god,” Tamas said. “But he thinks he is. And that’s a\npowerful Knack. His food alone is responsible for half the army’s morale.\nNow what do I do with him?”\nChapter 17\nI’m looking for Privileged Borbador.”\nTaniel stood in the entrance to a tavern. It was a big place, though very\nold. Half the roof had caved in and long since been badly repaired. It was\ncalled the Howling Wendigo. Its name came from the low whine of wind in\nthe eaves, which now drowned out everything else, as conversation in the\nplace had stopped.\nFifty or more sets of eyes stared at him. He was alone; he’d left Julene\nand Ka poel outside to wait. He wore his buckskins and his cap and he was\n‑\nglad of it. Spring or not down in the valley, Shouldercrown Fortress was\nstill locked in winter.\n“What business does a powder mage have with our Privileged?”\nOur Privileged. Taniel didn’t like the sound of that. Bo had made\nfriends with these thugs. Convicts and malcontents, the poor and the\nwretched—these were the members of the Mountainwatch. They didn’t\ntrust easily, and they welcomed strangers like a crowded city welcomes a\nplague. They were easily the toughest of the Nine.\nTaniel took a deep breath. He wasn’t in the mood for this. I’m here to\nkill him, he wanted to say. Get in my way and I’ll put a bullet in your head."

Get in my way and I’ll put a bullet in your head.\nInstead he said, “That business is mine.”\nA man stood up. He was younger than Taniel by a year or two at most.\nScrawny, bearded, he wore a sleeveless shirt despite the cold, his arms\ncorded with the muscles of a man who hauled timber and worked the mines.\nHe scowled at Taniel.\n“That business is ours,” the man said.\n“Fesnik, don’t mess with a powder mage,” someone else said. “You\nwant Tamas breathing down our necks?”\n“Shut up,” Fesnik called over his shoulder. “What if we don’t tell you?”\n“You the toughest one here?”\n“Huh?” Fesnik seemed taken aback by this.\n“Simple question,” Taniel said. “Are you the toughest, father-stabbing,\ngoat-raping, inbred son of a whore in this place?”\nFesnik turned away from Taniel, a half smile on his face. He came back\naround quickly, knife drawn. Taniel drew both pistols. One barrel went in\nFesnik’s mouth, cracking teeth and bringing the man’s knife thrust up short.\nFesnik’s eyes went wide. The other pistol pointed at the first Watcher to\nclimb to his feet.\n“My name’s Taniel Two-Shot,” Taniel said loudly. “And I’m here to\nsee my best friend, Bo. Tell me kindly where he is?”\n“Taniel Two-Shot?” a voice asked. “Why didn’t you damn well say so?\nBo’s up the mountain.”\n“That true?” Taniel asked Fesnik.\nThe man nodded, eyes crossed from staring at the pistol barrel in his\nmouth.\nTaniel holstered both pistols.\n“Sorry,” Fesnik said, checking his teeth. “Bo said not to let any powder\nmages know where he was. Nobody but you, that is. Said you might come\nlooking for him.”\nTaniel tried to keep the scowl off his face. “Sorry about the teeth,” he\nsaid. Louder, “Drinks on Field Marshal Tamas!”\nA general cheer went up around the room. Taniel gestured Fesnik\ncloser. “You say he’s up the mountain?”\n“He went up there almost two weeks ago. Right after an inspector\nfellow came up from Adopest to see him.”\n“When did he say he’d come back down?”\n“He didn’t.”\nTaniel scratched his jaw. He’d not shaved since starting his hunt for the\nPrivileged in Adopest. The thick curls on his neck itched. “Why’d he go\nup?”\nFesnik shook his head.\nTaniel felt a sharp fear run up his spine. Bo knew that Tamas would\nsend someone to kill him.\n“And he told you to tell only me?”\n“Yeah. He’s told us a lot about you. Said you two have been chums for\nyears.”\nThat felt like a knife thrust to Taniel’s gut. He clenched his teeth and\nforced a smile on his face. Psychological warfare on Bo’s part? Or just\ndrunken chatter? “That’s right. How long does it take to reach the top of the\nmountain?”"

How long does it take to reach the top of the\nmountain?”\n“Well, he won’t have gone all the way to the top,” Fesnik said. “There’s\na monastery up there for the pilgrims, a couple miles short of Kresim\nKurga. He’ll have stopped there.”\nKresim Kurga. The Holy City. It was a name out of legends. Taniel\nhadn’t heard the name since his nurse had taken him weekly to Kresimir’s\nchapel when he was a child. Even then, he’d never believed it really\nexisted.\nTaniel brought himself back to the present. He couldn’t wait here. He\nwould have to go up after Bo and leave him buried in the snow. Taniel\nwould be back in Adopest before they discovered Bo was dead.\n“I’ll go up and see him,” Taniel said.\n“This time of year?” Fesnik shook his head. “Not even a seasoned\nWatcher will guide you up, and believe me, without a guide you’ll walk\ninto a snowstorm and never come out. The roads are treacherous well up\nuntil early summer.”\n“My father mentioned a man named Gavril,” Taniel said. “Old friend of\nhis. Said he was the best mountain man in the Nine. What?”\nFesnik had started to laugh. “Gavril, he might do it. If he’s sober enough\nto see but drunk enough not to think straight. I’ll try to find him for you.”\nFesnik went off into the barroom crowd. Taniel returned to the street,\nwhere he found Julene glaring at Ka poel. Ka poel was staring up at the\n‑ ‑\nmountain above them.\n“Bo’s up there,” Taniel said, pointing to the mountain. “We’re going up\nafter him.”\nJulene’s eyes narrowed. “It’s probably a trap. He must know Tamas\nwould send someone.”\n“He does. But he told the Watchers to let me know where he was if I\ncame. No one else. That means he trusts me.”\n“Or he trusts himself to kill you before you can get off a shot.”\n“I know Bo. It means he trusts me.” He took a deep breath. “Worse luck\nfor him.”\n“We’ll need supplies and mountain gear,” Julene said. “And winter\nclothing.”\n“You’re not coming.”\n“What?” Julene stared at him hard.\n“You almost got me killed more than once,” Taniel said.\n“How dare you.”\n“Shut up. I’m going up there with Pole; we’re going to do in my best\nfriend and come right back down. Carefully, quietly. You start throwing\naround sorcery up there and not only will the entire Mountainwatch know\nwhat we’re doing but you’ll likely bring an avalanche down on us.”\nJulene sneered. “I don’t trust you. You’re weak. You won’t be able to\npull the trigger.”\n“Killing Privileged is my specialty,” Taniel said. He took a hit of\npowder. A small one, just to calm his nerves.

There’s another reason I’m leaving you down\nhere. If Bo gets the drop on me or slips by me somehow, I want you\nwatching. Kill him on sight. Can you do that, lady?”\nJulene’s arms trembled. She looked as if she wanted to leap on Taniel\nand tear his throat out with her teeth. Without a powder trance Taniel might\nhave been intimidated. With a powder trance, Taniel didn’t give a damn.\n“Well?” he asked. “Can you damn well do it?”\nJulene whirled and stalked away from him, down the street.\n“I’ll take that as a yes.”\nThe door to the tavern opened and Fesnik stepped out, shrugging into a\nknee-length deerskin coat. He was followed by one of the biggest men Taniel\nhad ever seen. He wore thick leathers and furs soaked with sweat and beer,\nand he struggled to focus his eyes on Taniel even as he toppled against the\nside of the building. He shook his head and slurred, “I’m Gavril.”\nTaniel looked him up and down. “Fantastic.”\nTaniel paused to adjust the furs protecting his face as a freezing wind\nspattered him with snow. He flinched away from the biting cold, turning his\nface from the wind, even though Gavril had warned him that to do so could\nmean death—always one foot in front of the other, eyes on the snowbank\nahead of you or you might step into a half-hidden fissure or off the edge of\na cliff.\nRight now, Taniel didn’t much care. Ten thousand feet below them,\nfarmers tilled their fields as the spring weather warmed. A few more weeks\nand it would be warm enough to go swimming in the Adsea. Yet here he\nwas, nearing the top of the highest mountain in all the Nine—some said the\nworld—with snowshoes strapped to his feet, armed with rifle and pistols\nthat were probably too frozen to work, on his way to kill his best friend,\nwith a drunk as a guide.\nHe was tied to Gavril by a sturdy rope, though the wind had died\nenough that he could see the big mountaineer through the eddy, some ten\npaces up the slope. Their climb was steep, but bearable. After all, there was\na road under there somewhere. This pass was well used in the summer—or\nso Gavril claimed. The wind swirling around them brought no fresh snow; it\nonly kicked up the top layer from the recent storm. Taniel could have sworn\nhe heard a child’s laughter every time more snow slapped him in the face.\nThe mountain was a cruel place, he decided.\nAnother rope led off behind Taniel, where Ka poel struggled slowly\n‑\nwith her snowshoes, and behind her a small man named Darden trekked\nalong in her wake. He was an old Deliv who had insisted on coming along.\nHe said he had a cousin at the monastery who had been dying last fall, and\nhe wanted to know if he had survived the winter. Taniel didn’t trust him.\nWas he one of Bo’s friends?"

Taniel didn’t trust him.\nWas he one of Bo’s friends?\nGavril was a jovial drunk, and had been surprisingly interested in the\ntrip up the mountain. They’d set off within hours, and though Gavril had\nwobbled on his snowshoes the first half day, Taniel was certain he’d gotten\ndead sober by the end of the second.\nTaniel paused briefly to check the pistol at his hip. The flintlock was\nfrozen, jammed with snow and ice. The powder still seemed to be dry,\nthough, and the bullet was wedged firmly in place. That was all that\nmattered for a Marked. He could make his own spark to fire the bullet.\nYet… Taniel examined Gavril. Would the man give him trouble when\nTaniel put a bullet through Bo’s eye? Or would any of the monks? Taniel\nchecked his second pistol. Would he be able to make it back down the\nmountain without Gavril if it came to that?\nBy the time they finally rose above the worst of the wind, Taniel had\nlong since ceased being able to feel his legs. The swirls of snow died down,\nand the sun came through the eddy, nearly blinding him. The trail leveled\nout, and suddenly he saw ground; not just hard-packed trails of snow but\nreal earth notched with shovel marks. This had been cleared recently. He\nblinked in surprise and tried to smile. His face was too numb.\n“How are you?” Gavril’s voice cut through Taniel’s thoughts. The\nwords were a welcome change to the howling wind and the mountain’s\nmocking laughter after three and a half days of climbing. Taniel realized\nthat they’d not said a word in that time, not even during their camps at\nnight, when the four of them huddled together for warmth in Gavril’s small\ntent.\n“Hine.” Taniel came to a stop beside the big mountaineer, and they\nwaited for Ka poel and Darden. Taniel closed his eyes and worked at his\n‑\nmouth, trying to form words.\n“Fine,” he said. “How much harther? Farther?”\n“There,” Gavril said. He pointed upward.\nTaniel shaded his eyes and squinted into the sun. “It’s so bright up here.\nI can’t see. How can you?”\n“Years on the mountain. You don’t need eyes after as long as I’ve been\nhere. Novi’s Perch. We’re just beneath it.”\nDarden grinned at Taniel through cracked lips, his dark-skinned face\nsplit with the size of the smile. He was a small man, and easily as old as\nTamas. “Almost there,” he said. He was barely breathing hard, Taniel\nnoticed with annoyance, though Taniel himself gasped for breath.\nTaniel held his snuffbox of powder up to his nose and snorted straight\nout of the box. He carefully returned it to his pocket—he didn’t trust his\nnumb fingers. The rush of the powder trance made him dizzy for a brief\nmoment, then his breathing came easier and his muscles relaxed.\nThey removed their snowshoes and finished the climb to the monastery."

They\nmoved into the shade of the monastery, and Taniel was able to look up and\nreally see it for the first time.\nNovi’s Perch seemed to be part of the mountain. It had been built of the\nsame dusty gray rock, and parts of it had even been hewn into the bones of\nPike itself. It blocked the trail—that is, the trail ended at the doors to the\nmonastery, and the building rose up above them for a hundred feet or more.\nIt overhung the cliffside to their right by a dozen feet, and Taniel wondered\nhow the monks could sleep, knowing they were suspended above thousands\nof feet of nothing.\nThe monastery was plain and unadorned. The stones were chiseled flat,\nthe arches of the doors and windows rounded at the top. There were no\nspires or grand façades. Only the location of the place gave it grandeur, and\nthe daring of its construction hanging out over the abyss.\nTaniel stepped off the road and onto the stone doorstep. He gazed\nupward, unaware that he’d been wandering, until Gavril reached out and\ngrabbed the front of his coat. He jumped. He’d been not two feet from the\nedge of the cliff and its perilous drop.\nThe double doors of the monastery opened with the whine of unoiled\nhinges. Taniel’s pistol was half drawn before he realized it wasn’t Bo. A\nman and woman, both about Taniel’s height, bowed their heads in greeting.\nThey were tall for Novi, and their skin was olive—just a shade lighter than\nDarden’s.\n“It’s very early in the year for pilgrims,” the Novi man commented\nwhen they’d all come inside.\nTaniel glanced at his weapons, at his thick furs and leathers, and at his\ncompanions with their climbing gear. They were obviously not pilgrims.\n“I’m here to see Privileged Borbador,” Taniel said quietly. The words\nechoed in the long, stone hallway, and Taniel felt like he was whispering\ninside of Pike’s own old bones. “Where can I find him?” Taniel needed to\nget this over with as quickly as possible. If Bo had an inkling Taniel was\nafter him…\nThe woman nodded solemnly. “I see. I’m afraid your journey has not\nquite ended.”\n“Pit.” Taniel glanced at the monks apologetically. “Sorry, sister.”\n“He’s a few miles up the trail past the monastery. A cave.”\n“I know that cave,” Gavril said.\n“Did Bo tell you why he came up here?”\nBoth monks shook their heads. “He said someone might come looking\nfor him,” the man said. “He asked us not to stop him from coming.”\nBo was definitely expecting someone. No getting around it.\n“How do I get up?” Taniel asked.\n“Through the monastery,” the woman said. “This is the only true path"

No getting around it.\n“How do I get up?” Taniel asked.\n“Through the monastery,” the woman said. “This is the only true path\nup the mountain, even in the summer. We are the gatekeepers to Kresim\nKurga.”\nTaniel felt his heart jump. “It really exists?”\nBoth monks raised an eyebrow at Taniel.\n“The Holy City?” Taniel said. “It’s really up there?”\n“The ruins, yes,” the man said. “Long ago, Novi chose his people to\nguard the high places of the Nine. Kresim Kurga may have been long\nabandoned, Kresimir’s protection dissipated, but we have not shirked the\nduty placed upon us by our saint.”\nGavril stepped up beside Taniel as Darden went to the man and woman\nand spoke in a low voice. Taniel tried to listen to them. He caught the words\n“ill” and “cousin” before Darden was led down the corridor by the man.\n“What is Kresimir’s protection?” Taniel asked.\nGavril was large enough that his head nearly scraped the monastery\nceiling. “The God wove powerful sorceries, back during his reign, so that\nno one, sick or in health, young or old, would be bothered by the elements\nor the altitude sickness.”\n“Altitude sickness?” Taniel said.\n“Comes from being so high up,” Gavril said. “Darden and I, we’re\nacclimatized. Others get thirsty, and bloody noses, headaches, sickness in\ntheir stomach. Of course, you’ll be fine.”\n“I’ll be fine? Why?”\nGavril didn’t answer. The Novi woman approached them. “Would you\nlike to rest before heading up?” she asked.\nTaniel knew he should, but he couldn’t risk Bo getting wind of his\narrival. “No thank you.”\n“It should be an easy climb,” she said as she led them through the\nmonastery. “We’ve started clearing the road up to the summit.”\nThey passed by many adjoining corridors that seemed to stretch deep\ninto the mountain, and by dozens of smaller rooms, doors open, monks\nwithin. There were both men and women. Taniel paused just outside one\nbedroom. A monk sat cross-legged on the floor, leaning over a box of\ncolored sand, making patterns with a long, curved stick. Taniel did not see\nmany monks outside their rooms, though he did hear voices down from the\ndeeper corridors. He’d never imagined that Novi’s Perch was this big, or\nthat so many people lived this high up the mountain all winter long.\nKa poel paused at every room and hallway, the smile on her face like\n‑\nthat of a child who wants to explore. Taniel dragged her along impatiently.\nAfter many flights of stone stairs they reached a sudden end. It looked\nidentical to the entrance on the other side, down to the same double doors.\n“The doors will be barred after you have gone through,” the Novi\nwoman said. “There are… others… on this side of the mountain.”\nTaniel paused at this. He opened his mouth to ask her, but she retreated\ndown the hallway. Taniel was left alone with Gavril and Ka poel. The big\n‑\nmountaineer shrugged."

The big\n‑\nmountaineer shrugged.\n“The monks have strange stories,” he said. “About what kinds of\ncreatures come out during the winter months, up in Kresim Kurga. They’ve\nbeen waiting longer each year before letting the pilgrims up.” He shrugged\nagain. “I’ve never seen anything strange up there, myself, aside from the\nodd cave lion. Ready?”\nTaniel put a hand on Gavril’s chest. “I’m heading up alone,” he said.\nThen, to Ka poel. “I want you to stay here too.”\n‑\nShe scowled at him.\n“I need to have a private talk with Bo. It shouldn’t take too long, and the\nmonks said the road is clear.”\nKa poel held up a finger, then jerked her thumb at herself.\n‑\n“No,” Taniel said. “You’re staying here. With Gavril.”\nGavril chewed on the inside of his cheek. “I really should… ,” he\nrumbled.\n“No,” Taniel said firmly. He hefted his rifle. “I’ve got this for cave\nlions.”\nTaniel heard Gavril bar the door after he’d gone out and wondered\nwhether the big mountain man was getting any ideas about Taniel’s visit.\nHe might suspect something. But then, the man was a drunk. Taniel’d get a\nfew drinks in him back at Shouldercrown before he headed off.\nThe trail widened enough that there was comfortable space between\nTaniel and the cliff edge. Eventually the sheer rock face on his left softened,\nuntil it became a rocky, snow-covered hillside. The trail was not steep here,\nand he didn’t need his snowshoes.\nTaniel spotted the cave from quite a ways down the road. It was easy to\nsee—the entrance was as big as a house. He found a good knoll not long\nafter. It was a small hill, perched just higher than the trail, between the trail\nand the cliff edge. He climbed it carefully and settled down in the snow. It\nwas perfect for a marksman. He could see the cave entrance completely and\nhe was hidden by snowbanks.\nThe only downside was that it sat on the edge of the cliff. It might have\nbeen ten thousand feet to the bottom, for all Taniel knew. He dug his\nfingers into the snow. If Bo got wind of Taniel, he’d be swept off the knoll\nwith the flick of Bo’s fingers.\nTaniel watched from his vantage for several minutes. His powder trance\nallowed him to see details of the cave even though it was far off. The\nentrance pointed just slightly off center from him. It appeared bored into the\nside of the mountain, with a thin footpath leading up to it and a steep hill of\nice and snow on the left. It was perched right on the edge of the cliff.\nThe cave was occupied. A thin trail of smoke curled from within, rising\nstraight into the windless sky, and the footpath was heavily trodden. Taniel\nopened his third eye to confirm it—Bo was there, his pastel glow wavering\nbeside a fire inside the cave. Taniel crawled back off the knoll and opened\nhis gear."

Taniel crawled back off the knoll and opened\nhis gear.\nTaniel began getting ready. He moved methodically, double-checking\neverything, cleaning the flintlock and pan of snow and checking the barrel\nbefore he began. He bit the cartridge and primed the pan, and then poured\nthe powder and ball into the muzzle. A little powder on his tongue to\ndeepen the powder trance, and then he rammed down the cotton. Lastly, he\nbrought out his sketchbook and flipped open to one of the first pages—Bo.\nA sketch Taniel had done on the voyage to Fatrasta. Bo was clean-shaven\nwith short hair and wide cheeks, a smirk on his lips. Taniel tapped the\nlikeness with one finger and climbed back up onto the knoll to wait.\nHe remained there as the sun passed its noon height and began to\ndescend to the west. The air cleared, and from his knoll he could look out to\nhis right and see all of Kez, distant plains and cities shimmering on the\nhorizon beneath the setting sun.\nThe passing time gave Taniel’s mind the chance to wander. He couldn’t\nhelp but think of Vlora. As young lovers they’d spent afternoons shirking their\ntraining to take to bed in cheap inns. He smiled at those memories and felt his\nheart beating faster. No, that wouldn’t do. He had to keep calm as he waited\nfor his quarry. He remembered one of those times, returning to find Tamas\nwaiting. Tamas had informed him that Taniel and Vlora would marry when\nthey were old enough, and that had been the start of their engagement.\nUnbidden, images of Vlora in bed with another man came to his mind.\nHis hands trembled until he pushed those images away. He forced himself\nto seek the calm of his powder trance. Think objectively. Did he love her?\nPerhaps. He’d always enjoyed her company. But did he really love her?\nTaniel often wondered about love. It sometimes seemed a foreign\nconcept—something out of poems. Vlora was the first woman he’d grown\ntruly close to since his mother’s death, when he was six. He had few\nmemories of his mother. Most of what he knew of her had been told to him\nafterward: that she was a powder mage and a member of the Adran nobility,\nthough her mother had been Kez. She’d been a hard woman on the outside,\nas hard as Tamas, but he distinctly remembered a gentle nature that\nemerged when they were at home. Even when Taniel had a governess to\nwatch him, his mother had always been present.\nThat had changed after her death. Taniel had gone through a string of\ngovernesses, whom he strongly suspected Tamas had been sleeping with.\nAnd then the governesses stopped, as if Tamas had had enough. The next\nwoman to enter their lives was Vlora. He remembered competing with Bo\nto try to impress her. It was the only time in his life he’d been able to best\nBo for a woman’s affections. Did that mean she was the only one for him?\nNo. It was too big a world for that.\nIt was surprising to him how little he thought of her now, so many"

Did that mean she was the only one for him?\nNo. It was too big a world for that.\nIt was surprising to him how little he thought of her now, so many\nweeks after ending their engagement. He touched his pocket, where he kept\nthe rumpled likeness of her he’d torn from his sketchbook. No, he did not\nlove her. He’d been hurt by her betrayal, but mostly in his pride. Their\nmarriage had been a foregone conclusion for so long that it seemed strange\nnot to have it looming in the future anymore.\nHe wondered what her assignment was now. Was she still attached to\nTamas’s staff? Tamas wasn’t overly sentimental, not by any stretch of the\nimagination. He’d be angry that the wedding was called off, but he’d not\nwant a talented powder mage like Vlora far off.\nTaniel found himself grinding his teeth together. Not sentimental. Ha.\nSent his own son up here to kill his best friend. Why would he do that? Was\nit punishment for letting Rozalia live? Was this some kind of test, to see if\nTaniel was still loyal?\nNo, it wasn’t any of those things. It was pure expedience for the old\nbastard. Taniel was the best shot in the army. He could shoot a man’s hat\noff at three miles on a windy day. If that wasn’t an option, Taniel could get\nclose to Bo without raising suspicions, and put a knife in his gut. When\nwould Tamas learn that expedience was not always right? He’d certainly\nhad a dose of it when he threw Nikslaus into the Adsea. Taniel couldn’t\nhelp but feel proud of his father for that. The pride was short-lived.\n“You’re going to have to take a shit eventually,” Taniel muttered to\nhimself as the day wore on. He remembered a time, crouching on a knoll in\nthe king’s forest outside of Adopest. He’d been fourteen. Bo had figured\nout where the queen and her handmaidens liked to bathe in the river.\nThey’d concealed themselves on a knoll for almost twenty-four hours\nbefore the women had come down to the river. Bo had been armed with a\nlooking glass; Taniel had a horn of powder and the eyesight of a powder\ntrance. It was risky, and they both knew the beatings they’d get if caught.\nYet the queen was said to be one of the most beautiful women in the Nine.\nAnd she was. The wait—and the risk—had been well worth it.\nThere was movement in the cave. Bo emerged. He stood in the entrance\nto the cave and rubbed his hands together, looking out over Kez not a foot\nfrom the edge of the cliff. Taniel wondered how Bo could do that without\nquaking at the fall. He took a deep breath and steadied himself for the shot.\nBo turned to examine the hillside. He removed a thick fur hood, and\nTaniel examined his childhood friend down the barrel of his rifle. Bo’s hair\nhad grown long in the Mountainwatch, and he sported a thin, unruly beard.\nHe’d lost a lot of weight since Taniel had last seen him. Bo studied the\nhillside and then looked down the road toward Taniel.\nTaniel resisted the urge to duck. Bo was looking right at him. Bo"

    "text": "He’d lost a lot of weight since Taniel had last seen him. Bo studied the\nhillside and then looked down the road toward Taniel.\nTaniel resisted the urge to duck. Bo was looking right at him. Bo\nshielded his eyes from the sun and tugged absently at his Privileged’s\ngloves. The arcane symbols on the back of the gloves caught the sunlight,\nand Taniel wondered whether Bo had surrounded himself with a shield of\nhardened air. Bo’s strongest elemental aura was air.\nDid Bo know he was here? Was Bo waiting, laughing to himself, ready\nto strike Taniel down when he betrayed his position? Was he watching\nTaniel with his third eye? Taniel couldn’t sense Bo’s third eye, or any kind\nof shield. Taniel’s finger tightened on the trigger.\nBo stood there for another minute or two, squinting down the road\nbefore he turned to go back inside.\nTaniel swore to himself. Why the pit didn’t he pull the trigger? He’d\nhad a good shot. He sighed. He knew the answer.\n“To the pit with it,” he said aloud, and stood up.\nHe came off his knoll and gathered his gear, then headed up the path\ntoward Bo’s cave.\nPit, what was he going to say? ‘Hi Bo, how have you been, I came up\nhere to kill you? But don’t worry, I’ve changed my mind. I hope everything\nis fine between us.’\nTaniel gathered his thoughts and his resolve—or what was left of it,\nanyway. He shook his head. He’d been forced to choose between duty and\nhis friend. He hoped that made him a good friend, because he was a piss-\npoor soldier.\nTaniel took one step onto the thin trail leading to the cave and froze. Bo\nhad come out of his cave again. Perhaps fifty paces separated them. Bo\nwould clearly see the rifle over Taniel’s shoulder. Would Bo recognize\nhim? Taniel pulled the furs away from his face and tried to smile. He raised\na hand in greeting.\nBo’s eyes narrowed. Taniel swallowed. Bo tugged on his Privileged’s\ngloves. They blended in with the snow, all white, save for the gold symbols\non the back.\nTaniel opened his mouth to call out a greeting.\n“Not another step,” Bo shouted. “Stay where you are!” He tugged on his\ngloves again, and Taniel could see something on Bo’s face that he didn’t\nlike. He knew why Taniel had come.\nBo raised his hands over his head. The pose was almost comical. Bo\nwas not a big man, and his thin cheeks and the wispy beard made him look\nlike a boy. Bo’s chest rose and fell, his breathing wild. He was gearing up\nfor something big. Taniel didn’t have to open his third eye to know that Bo\nhad touched the Else with his gloved fingers. Sorcery poured into the world.\nTaniel squeezed his eyes shut.\n“Get down, you fool!” Bo screamed.\nTaniel’s eyes flew open. Something hit him from behind, bowling him\nover. He flew down against a snowdrift, blood pounding in his ears as\nsomething big rushed by. Was that Gavril, all wrapped in his furs?"

No, that wasn’t Gavril. That\nwas a cave lion.\nThe name was a misnomer. It didn’t look much like a lion. Its back feet\nwere padded, like a cat’s, but its front feet were clawed like a rooster’s with\nthree great talons as long as sickles. It had a head like a tiger’s and the deep,\nbroad chest and maned shoulders of a lion. This one was bigger than any\nTaniel had ever seen or heard about. It made a Fatrastan swamp bear look\nsmall by comparison, and it rushed down the trail toward Bo on its hind\nlegs.\nBo’s fingers worked in the air as if plucking at the strings of an invisible\ncello. The air cracked, thunder peeling against the mountainside as\nlightning burst from the clear sky and connected with the lion’s head.\nThe creature wasn’t even stunned. It sprang from two feet onto four,\nbounding with the speed of a jaguar. Smoke rose from its furry mane.\nBo jerked one arm into the air and then let it fall. Ice on the hillside\nabove the cave lion suddenly surged down, a mini avalanche, hitting the\nlion with the force of ten carriages. The ice split, sliding around the creature\nas it ran onward, as if it were a shark’s fin cutting through the top of the sea.\nWind buffeted it; flames shot from the clear air and sprayed across its face.\nThe lion ignored them all.\nThe cave lion was fifteen paces from Bo, and Bo was looking tired.\nSweat poured from his brow. His fingers twitched, jerked at unseen strings.\nThe lion stopped in its tracks.\nIt slowed, shook its hoary head, and continued onward.\n“Don’t just sit there.”\nTaniel felt himself jerked to his feet. Gavril was there. His face was red\nfrom a long, hard run. He held a spear in one hand, like the kind used to\nhunt boar.\n“Shoot the damned thing!”\nTaniel flipped his rifle off his shoulder and sighted. The creature shook\nits head, as if dizzy, and let out a low howl. It slapped its ears with both\nclawed hands. It jerked about, slamming its head against the ground as if its\nskull was full of bees.\nTaniel pulled the trigger. The beast’s head jolted back where Taniel’s\nbullet hit it. He felt his eyes go wide. The bullet had connected and simply\nslid off the lion’s ugly face—just like it had the Privileged in Adopest. It\nhowled again and made a gesture of disgust toward Taniel with a taloned\nhand. There was sorcery in this creature, the kind gods are made of.\nTaniel felt the snow beneath him explode. He was thrown into the air,\ntoward the cliff edge. He landed in the snow and slid, unable to find any\npurchase. He scrambled for some kind of hold. There was nothing.

Rock jutted from the side of the mountain, a\nsheet a man’s length across beneath his boots that hadn’t been there a\nmoment before. Taniel struggled to climb back up to the trail. He felt hands\ngrab him.\n“Come on,” Darden said. The old Deliv Watcher was armed with a spear\nin one hand, just like Gavril was. He dragged Taniel up with the other.\nKa poel was there too, lending her small strength. She gave Taniel a wide-\n‑\neyed stare and then hurried after the others.\nTaniel looked for his rifle. It was on the ground, too far away. Did he\nhave time to reload? One glance toward Bo told him no.\nBo retreated to his cave, his back against the rocky wall of one side.\nThe cave lion surged toward him on two feet. It plowed onward as if\nagainst a current, each step a struggle. A struggle it was winning.\nGavril reached the lion first. He thrust his spear up, sinking it into the\nlion’s soft flank. It gave a wail and turned on him. He leapt out of range of\nthe raking claws just in time and rolled back down the trail. Darden jumped\nover Gavril’s rolling form, spear held at the ready, and rushed the cave lion.\nDarden exploded. One moment he was there, the next he was gone.\nBlood and ribbons of tissue spattered the mountainside. The cave lion\nhowled triumphantly. Taniel didn’t have time to think, didn’t take a\nmoment to consider Darden’s blood soaking his coat. He aimed both pistols\nand fired.\nA powder mage can float a bullet for some distance. It gives his shots\nextra range, and it cost nothing but his own mental exertion and a bit of\nextra powder. He can also ignite powder, transferring the energy by touch.\nA good Marked can do it with bullets, giving one the strength and energy to\npierce rock or steel.\nTaniel ignited his whole powder horn and pushed the blast behind his\nbullets.\nThey tore right through the cave lion. It screamed as bubbling green\nblood sprayed the icy trail. The lion turned from Bo, its howls sounding like\nthe scream of a wounded horse, and instead turned to face Taniel. It raised a\ntaloned hand. Taniel felt the heat of approaching sorcery.\nKa poel squeezed past Taniel on the narrow trail, throwing herself\n‑\nbetween him and the beast.\n“Dammit! Pole, no!”\nKa poel lifted both hands defiantly. She held something in one hand—a\n‑\ndoll. It was naked and about the size of a hand, shaped from wax. The\ncraftsmanship was superb. Every part was accurate to a person—a woman,\nto be precise—especially the face. It was Julene.\nKa poel stabbed the doll with a long needle. The cave lion howled again\n‑\nand clutched its side.

Ka poel bent\n‑\nforward, took a long, deep breath, and then blew on the doll.\nThe cave lion burst into flame. Bo renewed his attacks, fingers flying,\nlances of ice bursting from the inside of the cave to smash against the lion.\nShakily, Taniel reloaded one of his pistols. He had a few powder charges\nleft, though his horn was empty. What could he do against a creature like\nthis? It was trapped between Bo and Ka poel’s sorcery but it refused to die.\n‑\nHow long could they keep it up?\nTaniel whirled. “Gavril, your powder horn. Now!”\nGavril, a little ways down the trail, locked eyes with Taniel and tossed\nhim the powder horn.\nTaniel caught the horn and hefted it in one hand. Mostly full. Good. He\nturned. Bo looked like he was about spent, and Ka poel juggled the burning\n‑\ndoll in her hands, needle and fingers thrusting, a look of savage glee on her\nface.\n“Down!” Taniel shouted, tossing the powder horn. He grabbed Ka poel\n‑\nby the shoulders and threw her against the mountainside. The horn landed\nbetween the mountain and the cave lion. With a thought, Taniel ignited it.\nHis mind warped the blast, guiding it with Marked sorceries to\nmaximize the power of the detonation. The cave lion was thrown into the\nair, twenty, thirty, fifty paces out from the mountain before it began to\ncurve and plummet. Taniel watched it go, howling, clawing. The howl\nchanged, turning to a scream as the lion’s shape warped into the body of a\nwoman. It bounced off the mountainside, far down, and continued to fall,\ndisappearing through the clouds below.\nChapter 18\nTamas stopped underneath a streetlamp to check the address he’d scribbled\non plain stationery a few hours before. “One seven eight,” he muttered to\nhimself, squinting to see the number plaques. Olem walked a few feet\nbehind him, pistols hidden under a long coat, keeping an eye out for\ntrouble.\nThe Routs was a wealthy part of town, where the banks and the\nremnants of the old merchant guilds still did business every weekday. It had\nbarely been touched by the earthquake, and not at all by the royalist\nuprising. Side streets were lined with small but well-kept houses for\nbusinessmen, clerks, and merchant liaisons. The lanterns were lit, and there\nwas a common police beat on every street, enough that Tamas wondered if\nhe’d stumbled into the wrong part of town.\nBad place to kill a man, he noted. He paused, correcting himself as he\nnoticed that there was a splash of darkness on the street up ahead. As he\ndrew closer, he saw that a good half-dozen lamps had blown out—or had\nbeen put out, as was the case.

The place looked abandoned.\nThe door opened a crack, and he and Olem were admitted immediately.\nOlem waited in the sitting room while Tamas was taken by the arm and led\ndown a hall and then into what he guessed to be a back room. A match was\nstruck and a candle lit.\nTamas saw a familiar face over the candle.\n“Good to see you, Tamas,” Sabon said.\n“Likewise. I hope I’m not too late.”\n“The Barbers aren’t here yet.”\n“Good. I want to see how they operate.” Tamas’s eyes adjusted to the\nlight and he glanced around. They were in a small kitchen, the floors and\ncupboards bare. A man sat on one of the counters in the corner, an unlit\npipe in the corner of his mouth. He was a small man, demure and of\nmedium build, his face covered with a thick black beard that made his\nfeatures almost impossible to see in the dim light. He chewed on the stem of\nhis pipe and watched Tamas.\n“You are our contact?” Tamas asked.\n“Fingers,” the man said.\n“I take it that’s not your real name?” Tamas said, raising an eyebrow.\n“A pseudonym,” he said. “For my protection.” The man was studying\nTamas with some intent, his eyes working up and down slowly—judging,\nweighing. Tamas felt there was something peculiar about the man.\n“You have the Knack,” Tamas said.\nFingers adjusted his long black coat and brushed something off the\nfront. “Ah, yes,” he said. “A lot of spies do. It makes it easier to get things\ndone when you have talents that others can’t judge.”\n“It also makes it damn hard for me to put together a spy network, since\nManhouch’s whole system went to ground when I killed the royal cabal.”\n“Fearing for one’s life gives one an incentive to disappear.” Fingers’s\neyes darted between Sabon and Tamas. It was clear he didn’t like being in\nthe same room with two powder mages.\n“Yet here you are,” Tamas said.\n“I have mouths to feed.” He paused, then added, “I’m a very minor\nKnacked. I can pick locks without a set, open latches from the outside.”\nTamas had heard scholars talk about this kind of thing. Minor\ntelekinesis, they called it. “Nothing that would be a threat to me,” Tamas\nsaid. “Yes, I get your meaning, but I have no quarrel with anyone outside\nthe royal cabals—unless they have a quarrel with me. I need Manhouch’s\nspies. You let it be known that we’re paying twice what Manhouch did.”\nFingers removed the pipe from his mouth and coughed into his hand.\n“Are you laughing at me?” Tamas said. He glanced at Sabon. The Deliv\njust shrugged.\n“What the pit is so funny?” Tamas said.\n“That stuff about paying us more,” Fingers said, “It doesn’t really work\nthat way.”\nTamas narrowed his eyes. “How does it work?”"

A soldier has loyalty, yes, but\nat the end of the day he does what he does for a full belly and a month’s\nwages. Spies do it because they love the game. They love their country, or\ntheir king.”\n“Are you saying I won’t be able to use Manhouch’s old spy network?”\nFingers pointed the stem of his pipe at Tamas. “Not at all, Field\nMarshal. Some of us were loyal to Manhouch himself. Those have already\nleft the country, or are working for the Kez outright. The rest of us love\nAdro and will drift back. I suspect the longer I stay alive, being a Knacked\nand all, the more spies will come out of the woodwork.”\nTamas rubbed his eyes. When they came out of the woodwork, he’d\nhave to worry about whether they were double agents and whom to trust. It\nwas all a great big headache. “I thought you said you did this because you\nhave a family to feed,” Tamas said.\nFingers nodded. “Right, well, I may have lied about them.”\nSabon snickered. Tamas threw him a look. Spies. He’d rather let the\nwhole lot of them rot in the pit. Unfortunately, he needed them.\n“Are the Barbers here yet?” Tamas asked.\n“I don’t know,” Fingers said.\nTamas jerked a thumb at the door. “Go find out.”\n“Someone will let us know.”\n“Now.”\nThe spy scurried from the room, and Tamas went over to the counter,\nhoisting himself up. He rubbed at the stitches on his chest, resisting the urge\nto pick at them.\n“I need some advice,” Tamas said.\n“Of course you do. You’re like a newborn babe, without me by your\nside.”\nThe silence dragged on for several moments. Tamas could read Sabon’s\neyes. If I’d been there, they said, that Warden wouldn’t have come close to\nkilling you.\n“Mihali,” Tamas said. “The mad chef.”\n“Is this really worthy of your attention?”\n“He’s cooking for the whole army. Morale is higher than ever, mostly\nthanks to him.”\n“So what more do you know about him?”\n“He escaped from the Hassenbur Asylum,” he said.\n“Ah. A madman.”\n“They certainly think so. They’ve sent some men to retrieve him. He\nclaims he was committed because his relatives and competitors were\njealous of him.”\n“Paranoid?”\nTamas shrugged. “Possibly.”\n“Send him back,” Sabon said. “His cooking is good, but it’s not worth\nmaking enemies of the asylum’s patrons. Do you know who they are?”\n“A man named Claremonte.”\nSabon was silent for a moment. “The new head of the Brudania-Gurla\nTrading Company?”\n“Yes.”\n“I think that settles it. We can’t risk our supply of saltpeter.”\n“I’m not so sure,” Tamas said."

We can’t risk our supply of saltpeter.”\n“I’m not so sure,” Tamas said.\n“That rubbish in the newspapers?” Sabon snorted. “Mihali claiming to\nbe Adom reborn? Evidence of his madness, I would think. Not many\neducated men believe such myths.”\n“You haven’t met him.”\nSabon ran a hand over his smooth head. “You believe him?”\n“Don’t look at me like that. Of course not. But the man’s harmless.”\n“Then what reason could you have to keep him?”\n“Sorcery,” Tamas said.\n“He’s a Privileged?”\n“He has the Knack,” Tamas said. “Something to do with food. He can\ncreate the stuff out of thin air.”\nSabon said, “That doesn’t sound like much.”\n“Have you ever heard of anyone who could create matter out of thin air?\nEven a Knacked?”\n“Huh,” Sabon grunted. “He’d be the richest man in the world.”\n“We can use him to feed all of Adro if we need to. Even during a\nfamine. We may need him badly the longer the war lasts.”\n“Parlor tricks?”\nTamas said, “I think not. Olem and I both watched him carefully. He\npulled an empty pot down from its hook and set it on the stove, only to have\nit full of stew and boiling the next time I looked at it. He put ten loaves of\nbread into the oven and pulled out a hundred.”\nSabon frowned. “It could still be sorcery and tricks. He could be a\npowerful Privileged, hiding his true strength. There’s no telling what\nPrivileged are capable of. Not even the royal cabals know everything that\naura manipulation can do.”\n“Yes, that crossed my mind as well. Rumors are spreading, however,\nand I fear that a cult might form. Among my ranks, no less, for Olem says\nhe’s become very popular with the seventh brigade. They love his food.”\n“What will you do?”\n“I can’t just dismiss him and send him back to the asylum,” Tamas said,\n“not after what I’ve seen. At the very least he’s a powerful Knacked—if an\nodd one—and we’ll want him as our ally. As I said. The worth of food\nduring wartime is immeasurable.”\nThey were interrupted by the door opening again. It was Fingers.\n“Everything is ready,” the spy said. “Come with me.”\nThey followed him in the dark up to a small room on the second story,\nat the front of the house, with a good view of the street. The curtains were\ndrawn back, but the room was completely dark so as to hide them from any\nprying eyes. Fingers directed them to a pair of chairs set a pace back from\nthe window. They sat and waited.\n“So this is him?” Tamas asked quietly, nodding to the house across the\nstreet before realizing they couldn’t see his movement.\n“It is,” Fingers responded. “A long-term spy for the Kez. He owns a\nsmall shipping company on the Adsea. The Warden that tried to kill you:\nHe was smuggled into the country on one of this man’s cargo ships.”\n“And you’re certain he’s involved?”"

The Warden that tried to kill you:\nHe was smuggled into the country on one of this man’s cargo ships.”\n“And you’re certain he’s involved?”\n“The man’s in deep. He’s a banker here in the Routs and has friends\namong the city council. He’s been talking a lot at the local town hall,\nspouting about how the powder mages are going to get us all killed and we\nshould pull down your council and surrender to the Kez.”\n“That’s awfully bold,” Tamas said.\nFingers said, “Yes, and I would have thought too bold for a spy, if we\nhadn’t been watching him since he immigrated to the country fifteen years\nago. There’s no doubt that he was involved getting the Warden here.”\n“I want to make something clear,” Tamas said, his voice dropping to\nbarely a whisper. “I don’t want a wholesale slaughter of Adro citizens. I\ndon’t want a police state. We’re only doing this to rid ourselves of Kez\nspies, so unless you have evidence that a dissenter is indeed a spy, simply\npass him on to the local precinct that he needs to be watched. I’m not ready\nto wage war on our own people and the Kez.”\nThere was a moment of silence. “Understood.”\n“Good. Is everything working out?” Tamas said. “Working with the\nBarbers? I must admit I have reservations about using them.”\n“They’re a wonder,” Fingers said. “I’ve not seen anything like it, even\namong our own killers. I’m surprised we’ve never used them before.”\n“That good?” Sabon asked.\n“That thorough,” Fingers said. “They kill quietly and they clean up their\nmesses to perfection. Not a single drop of blood left behind, and the bodies\njust gone. It’s flawless.”\nTamas remembered the barricades and the bodies of nobles and royalist\nleaders lying in their blood-soaked beds, throats slit wide. “So they have\nsome restraint, then?”\nFingers gave a low chuckle. “Yes, well, when they want the bodies\nfound, it’s quite messy. It keeps their street reputations intact and keeps the\nlarger gangs from messing with them. We asked them to do it quietly,\nthough, and I’ll be damned, they are.” There was a wince in his voice that\nTamas barely caught.\n“And the problem?” Tamas said.\n“Sometimes no sign at all is worse than a body. It starts rumors when\nthere’s not a book out of place in the whole house and a family was there\nyesterday and gone tomorrow. Bad kinds of rumors, like ghosts and demons\nand gods.”\nTamas thought of South Pike Mountain, smoking in the distance, and of\nAdamat’s explanation of Kresimir’s Promise and of Mihali’s cryptic\nwarnings. Rubbish. The common folk would believe anything. “I don’t\nwant any more of these rumors. See if you can make things a little more\norganic.”\n“We’ll do our best.”\nTamas caught sight of a dark shape in the street. He tapped Sabon and\nguided his gaze in that direction. Several more shapes joined the first.\n“I’ll be back in a while,” Fingers said. The spy left the room without a\nsound, and a moment later joined the dark shapes in the street. Tamas"

Tamas\nthought he could make out the familiar apron uniforms of barbers. He shook\nhis head.\n“I think I’m going to shave myself from now on,” he said quietly.\n“You and me alike,” Sabon said.\n“The local police?” Tamas asked.\n“They’ve been warned off tonight. They’ll leave us be, because they\nknow they’ll have one less problem to deal with in the morning.”\nTamas opened his third eye. In that vision, Fingers was a dim glow of\ncolor, standing out even through the walls of the house. He followed\nFingers as he made his way into the front door of the house across the street\nand then up the stairs to the bedrooms.\n“Wait,” Tamas said. “That other spy, the one they’re going after. He’s a\nsorcerer. Stronger than a Knacked. A Privileged.”\nSabon was silent for a moment. “Shit. Here, watch the windows.” He\nmoved from his chair, feeling around for a moment, then pushed a rifle into\nTamas’s hands.\nTamas adjusted the rifle by feel alone. “Loaded and primed?”\n“Yes,” Sabon said.\n“It’ll make a hell of a racket,” Tamas said. “There won’t be any\nquestion of what happened here, not for anyone on these streets.”\n“Just in case,” Sabon said.\nTamas sighted down his rifle, watching the windows of the front\nbedroom. He could see the glow of the Kez Privileged, lying there in bed,\nand he could sense Fingers standing in the door to the room. He thought he\ncaught a glimpse of shadows moving in the darkness.\nTamas ducked instinctively as a flash of sorcery lit up the window in his\nsights. The flash was followed by a muffled thump, barely audible, and then\nthere was silence. Tamas peered out the window, rifle at the ready. He\ncould see the Knacked and the Privileged by their glows. Fingers was in the\nstaircase, flat on his belly, while the Kez Privileged knelt on the ground in\nthe bedroom. Tamas could only guess there had been a razor to his throat—\notherwise more sorcery would have followed. Fingers slowly climbed to his\nfeet and entered the bedroom. Tamas lowered his rifle.\nA few minutes passed before dark figures emerged from the other\nhouse: the Barbers and their prisoners. They crossed the street, and Tamas\nheard the door downstairs open. He remained in his seat, watching the street\nfor any sign of interested neighbors or overly curious passersby, while\nSabon went to check on things. There were no such signs.\nFingers returned a moment later. He held a candle in one hand. He\ndidn’t look happy. “You didn’t warn us he was a Privileged.”\n“You should have seen for yourself,” Tamas said. “If you really have\nthe Knack, you’d have the third sight as well. Damned sloppy.”\n“I can’t open it,” Fingers mumbled. “Leaves me with the runs for a\nweek.”\n“That Privileged could have left you without a head,” Tamas said."

Light and sound. Nothing real,\nthough for a moment I thought the flesh was going to melt from my bones.”\n“Fright keeps you honest.” Tamas uncocked his rifle and leaned it\nagainst the wall. “You brought over the wife,” he said.\n“She woke up when he made the flash. He must have warded the room.\nWas awake the moment the Barbers were at his bedside.” He shook his\nhead. “I’ve seen these fellows kill a man with his wife in his arms and take\naway his body, leaving her sleeping like a babe. If it wasn’t for the wards, it\nwould have gone more smoothly.”\nFingers was nervous that Tamas thought he’d botched the job, Tamas\nrealized. “Well done,” Tamas said. “Let me know what your interrogation\nfinds.”\n“You’re not coming?” Fingers looked surprised.\n“Despite what you may have heard, I don’t have a bloodlust for\nPrivileged,” Tamas said.\nFingers sniffed, as if disappointed. “I don’t think he’s going to say\nmuch. He looks like a tough one.”\n“Tell him he loses a hand in five minutes if he doesn’t talk. Tell him the\nother one in ten.”\nFingers’s eyes grew wide. “That’s…”\nTamas gave him a shallow smile. “OK, so maybe I have a slight\nbloodlust for sorcerers. I also know how to deal with them.”\nFingers left the room. Tamas listened for screams, yet there were none.\nWherever they were, they’d muffled the room well. Sabon came up after a\nminute.\n“Fingers looks ill,” he said.\n“I told him to take the hands of the Privileged if need be.”\nSabon snorted. “That’s a dangerous precedent. Is that the policy we’re\ngoing to take with noncabal Privileged in Adro?”\n“Pit, no,” Tamas said. “This bastard is a Kez spy, though, and we need\nto work quickly.”\nFingers came into the room not long after. His face was pale in the\ncandlelight, his hands shaking a little. “He’s given up three names already.”\nTamas felt a bit of trepidation. “Anyone on my council?”\n“No. He claims he never had direct dealings with anyone higher than\nhimself. Just coded messages and intermediaries. He did give up the name\nof his wife.” He paused. “Push a man too hard, Field Marshal, and he’ll\ngive up his own mother. There’s a reason we keep a limit on torture.\nThey’ll say anything for the pain to end.”\n“It’s purely psychological,” Tamas said. “You didn’t actually cut off a\nhand, did you?” He smothered his disappointment at not having any clue to\nthe traitor on his council.\n“No…”\n“Interrogate the wife. Find out what she knows. Hand them both over to\nmy soldiers when you’re finished and they’ll deal with the executions. Any\nchildren?”\n“One,” Fingers said. “She’s at a girls’ boarding school in Novi.”"

Any\nchildren?”\n“One,” Fingers said. “She’s at a girls’ boarding school in Novi.”\n“A neutral country,” Tamas mused. “They were prepared for this\neventuality. Send a missive to her school mistress. Tell her to keep her at\nthe school, indefinitely.”\nFingers nodded shakily.\n“What word do we have about these spies?” Tamas asked. “These\nplants, like this one. How many do you think they are?”\nFingers chewed on his pipe stem furiously. “You won’t like it.”\n“I don’t have to like it,” Tamas said. “I just need to know.”\n“Hundreds,” Fingers said. “Just from our first handful of encounters\nwe’ve gotten dozens of names—good names, too, and not just ones spouted\noff under torture. People who check out as Kez spies, and hundreds more\nwith a big question with their names. The Kez are in here deep. They’ve\nbeen planning this for decades.”\nTamas closed his eyes. Not what he wanted to hear. There could be\nspies in his army, spies in the city and the countryside, in every building in\nAdopest. He already knew one of his council had betrayed him. How many\nmore would? “Well done, Fingers,” Tamas said quietly. The spy waited a\nmoment before he left, one eye fixed on Tamas the whole time.\n“I’ll have to double what I’m paying the Barbers,” Tamas said. “They\nhave the manpower, if I have the money.”\nSabon said, “It’s dangerous, depending too much on them.”\n“A risk I have to take. These spies. They could bring down everything\nwe’ve worked for. We’ll double patrols and give the local police more\nauthority. Kresimir, we might have to push back plans for the new\ngovernment.”\n“We’ve always known it was a dodgy road we would have to walk. Just\ndon’t forget about the people.”\n“Of course not. How goes the training?” he asked Sabon. “Pray, tell me\nsome good news.”\nA weary smile crossed Sabon’s face. “Better than I expected. Andriya\nmay be crazy, but the younger recruits like him. Vidaslav, as it turns out,\nhas some talent for teaching. We’ve shown the ones with the least amount\nof talent how to find a powder mage and turned them around, sending them\nout recruiting. There are already more candidates than I thought possible.”\n“How many?”\n“Thirteen so far with a decent amount of talent. Two of those with the\ncapabilities to rival me. Unfortunately none on your level, or Taniel’s.”\n“Thirteen?” Tamas said. “You’re joking. It took me years to gather the\npowder cabal we have now.”\n“I wouldn’t believe it unless I saw it myself,” Sabon said. “Remember,\nthere was a powder-mage cull less than a hundred and fifty years ago in\nAdro. Every man, woman, and child checked for any strength with powder\nand executed if discovered. Nowadays people hide it if they find themselves\nwith the affinity. At least, they did. We’re trying to work out a system to\nseek out powder mages directly.”\n“You mean like the Privileged Dowsers?”"

We’re trying to work out a system to\nseek out powder mages directly.”\n“You mean like the Privileged Dowsers?”\nSabon nodded. “The royal cabal had more potent sorcery at their call\nthan we do. And greater numbers. I’m sure we’ll work out something,\nthough.”\nTamas slapped him on the shoulder. “Good work, my friend. Keep me\ninformed. I know you’re not happy about the assignment.”\n“There is one other thing I should ask you.” Sabon seemed to hesitate\nfor a moment.\n“What is it?”\nSabon spoke slowly, choosing his words carefully. “Until recently,\nTaniel and Vlora were meant to wed. I must ask you, did you put them\ntogether purposefully?”\n“What do you mean?” Tamas asked, though he had a pretty good idea\nwhere Sabon was heading.\n“Did you pair them in order for their children to be powder mages?”\nTamas considered his response. It was opportune, certainly, and his\nencouraging them to be together was definitely not without ulterior motive.\n“The thought had crossed my mind.”\n“Not even the royal cabals resorted to such breeding,” Sabon said. It\nwas obvious he disapproved.\n“They didn’t? Why do you think the king provided each male sorcerer\nwith his own harem? Benevolence? No, Sabon, they most definitely bred\nfor Privileged. It’s not common knowledge, but the Beadle alone had over a\nthousand children.”\n“Any Privileged?”\n“One,” Tamas said. “A younger member of the royal cabal. Didn’t even\nknow who his father was.”\nSabon’s mouth hung open in horror. “What happened to all those other\nchildren?”\n“Work camps, orphanages, the Mountainwatch.” Tamas shrugged.\n“Some were even slaughtered as babes. The royal cabal has never been a\npleasant place. I will not let my powder cabal become like that, but yes, I\nintended for their children to be Marked. In my own studies, powder mages\ninherit hereditarily far more often than Privileged.”\n“How long have you been studying this?” Sabon asked.\n“Since long before we met.”\nSabon regarded him with dark eyes. “Erika was a powder mage.”\nTamas fought the snarl that crept onto his face. It was a fair enough\nassumption on Sabon’s part. “Don’t even think it,” Tamas said. His voice\ncame out an angry growl despite his effort. “I loved my wife. I’d give\nanything to have her back.” His voice cracked. He cleared his throat.\n“Taniel was not an experiment.”\n“Good.” He seemed satisfied with the answer. After a brief pause, “I\nwas hoping after your recent adventure you’d recall me.”\nTamas shook his head. “I’m sorry. I need you teaching new powder\nmages. I can take care of myself.”\nTamas could hear Sabon grinding his teeth. “You’re a stubborn bastard,\nand it’s going to get you killed,” Sabon said. “They’ll send more than one\nWarden next time.”\n“Likely, but not yet. I’m going to get some sleep. Before you head back\nto your school, let someone know I want that spy beheaded and his hands"

Before you head back\nto your school, let someone know I want that spy beheaded and his hands\nsent back to Kez with his widow.

There were more buried, Gavril told them, farther up the trail:\npilgrims who did not survive the journey to the summit, and monks who\nhad fallen prey to winter or to sickness or to predators upon the mountain.\nHe assured them Darden would be in good company.\nTaniel clenched a nub of charcoal between his fingers and began\nsketching Darden’s face in his book. The memory of how the man looked\nwas already beginning to fade. Taniel just hadn’t known him long enough.\nHe closed his eyes, trying to remember.\nThe vision of Julene—Taniel knew for certain it was her now—\nbouncing and screaming her way down the rock face and out of sight\nhaunted Taniel throughout the night. He couldn’t sleep, for each time he\nmanaged to fall asleep, he saw Julene’s body, or that of the cave lion,\nthrashing and angry before his mind’s eye, mocking him. How could he not\nhave seen it? Her anger, her recklessness. At the very least he should have\nbeen watching for a double cross. He ended up sitting in the cave entrance,\nwatching the sky above begin to lighten as the sun rose in the east, on the\nother side of the mountain.\nHe’d disobeyed a direct order. What would Tamas do about it? What\ngood could come of it? Tamas would just send another powder mage.\nMaybe he’d even come himself. He’d have Taniel court-martialed. Could\nTamas have him executed? Taniel didn’t think even a man like Tamas\ncould execute his own son. He hoped not, anyway.\nHow would Taniel explain this to Tamas? What would they do when\nanother powder mage came for them? Taniel kicked a piece of ice over the\nledge. They’d deal with those problems when they came up.\nHe heard ice crunch underfoot as Bo joined him. Taniel gave his friend\na long look. Bo seemed as if he hadn’t slept well for weeks. His eyes were\nred, his face sunburned. He seemed to be constantly sweating, and he\nfingered the lapel of his coat nervously as he took a seat next to Taniel.\nBo watched the stars fade as Taniel sketched a likeness of Darden, until\nTaniel heard the first cries of birds looking for a morning meal.\n“You’re getting quite good,” Bo said. “Looks just like him.”\n“I’m glad you think so,” Taniel said. “I was having trouble picturing\nhim.” He tucked the bit of charcoal into a pouch and folded his sketchbook.\n“Tamas has a lot of gall sending you up here to kill me,” Bo said. His\nvoice was pleasant, quiet. A feature many of his women found soothing, no\ndoubt. “Don’t get me wrong,” he added. “I’m glad he did. Somebody else\nmay have taken that shot. You could have chosen a better time, though.”"

Taniel blew on\nhis hands to warm them.\n“A powder mage, eventually,” Bo said. “Actually, I expected Julene\nfirst. She’s the one I was preparing for.” He pointed down the trail, along\nthe ledge of the mountain and the monastery far below. “I’ve been warding\nthis whole trail for two weeks now. Ever since that inspector visited and\ngave me the message that she would try to summon Kresimir.” He fingered\nhis lapel again, running a finger along the collar.\n“ ‘She’?”\n“Julene. That Predeii bitch.”\n“Predeii,” Taniel said. “That Privileged I tracked in Adopest said she\nwas a Predeii.”\nBo swallowed hard. “Two of ’em? Pit.”\n“What’s a Predeii?” Taniel said.\n“You don’t know?”\n“Would I ask if I did?”\nBo frowned. “There’s a lot you find out in a royal cabal. Things only\nscholars remember. Secrets a thousand years old or more. I, uh… you said\nTamas slaughtered the royal cabal, right?”\n“Yeah.”\nBo looked up at the fading stars. “I suppose no one will come after me\nfor spilling secrets, then.” He took a deep breath. “Kresimir didn’t come\nhere on his own.”\nTaniel gave his friend a skeptical look. “I haven’t attended a sermon\nsince I was a boy. Only peasants listen to that stuff these days.”\n“Peasants aren’t as dim as you think,” Bo said. “All superstition has\nbasis in fact.”\n“And you believe this superstition?” Taniel asked, looking down his\nnose at Bo.\nBo took a deep breath. “There’s a difference between having faith in\nsomething you’ve never seen or experienced and knowing firsthand that it’s\ntrue.”\n“You’re saying you met Kresimir?”\n“No, I didn’t meet…” Bo sighed. “Just shut up and listen. They show\nyou things in the royal cabal that have been passed on through the minds of\nsorcerers for millennia.”\nTaniel snorted. “Kresimir. All right. Assuming he is real, that was\nthousands of years ago.”\n“Oh, Kresimir was real. Whether you call him a god or a mighty\nsorcerer, every history from that time agrees that he was real. And it was\nfourteen hundred years ago, give or take. The exact timeline was lost in the\nBleakening,” Bo said. “He was summoned. Brought here, maybe even\nforced into this world by the Predeii. Some think that he was even bent to\ntheir will.”\n“God or sorcerer, how could anyone force him to come to this world?”\nBo fiddled with his collar. “Predeii are the predecessors of the\nPrivileged.

They summoned\nKresimir from”—he made a mystical gesture with one hand and shrugged\n—“and they bid him use his power to bring order to the Nine.”\n“The saints?” Taniel said.\nBo gave a shake of his head. “No. Good thought, though. The saints—\nAdom, Novi, and the rest—they came later, when Kresimir was not up to\nthe task anymore and needed to summon brothers and sisters to help him.\nTheir shared his power and his wisdom, and when he left, so did they.”\n“But the Predeii remained?” Taniel asked. “They’d be thousands of\nyears old.”\n“Or more,” Bo said. He shrugged again. “They discovered a way to\nkeep from dying from age or disease, even before they summoned Kresimir.\nSorcery was more potent back then. I don’t even know if anyone has the\npower to kill a Predeii now.”\nTaniel swallowed. He looked over the edge of the cliff, into the swirling\nclouds of nothingness below. “You mean she’s not dead?”\nBo’s face was grim. “I don’t know. Probably not, though I’m trying to\nremain optimistic. Either way, we have to go find out. If she survived, then\nAdro is in great danger.”\n“How?”\n“She wants to annihilate our armies, our sorcerers, and our powder\nmages. Half the work is already done with the royal cabal dead. If she\nsummons Kresimir back, then he’ll do the rest of the work for her and Adro\nwill be under her thumb. Kresimir made it clear once that he had no interest\nin ruling the Nine for very long. If Julene proves to him that the kings and\ntheir royal cabals are not up to the task, she thinks he’ll leave her in charge.\nShe’s been waiting a long time to rule.”\nTaniel scoffed. “Kresimir. Who thinks of things like that? Kresimir is\nlong gone.”\n“Julene doesn’t think so. Neither do the Kez nobility, and certain\nfactions within the Kresim Church.”\n“Why would she want a god here? It sounds like she’s nigh unto a god\nherself.” It explained the battle at Adopest University—how Rozalia and\nJulene seemed so powerful, and how Julene survived Rozalia’s assault.\n“Power. That’s all Julene cares about. Power over others. The history\nbooks refer to the Bleakening, a time when knowledge of Kresimir was lost.\nOnly the royal cabals remember what happened during the Bleakening. It\nwas a war between the Predeii and the new kings of the Nine and their royal\ncabals. Julene claims, quite proudly, to have started the war. Millions died.\nIn the end, the Predeii were vastly outnumbered and lost. Some died, some\nfled. Others hid. Julene was one that survived.”\n“You seem to know a lot about her.”\n“We were… together… once.” Bo grimaced.\nTaniel couldn’t help but bark a laugh.\n“I’m not proud of it,” Bo said."

She fell for\nme and taught me things she shouldn’t have.”\n“And now she’s trying to kill you? Why?”\nBo tossed a rock over the cliff and watched it until it disappeared. “You\nsay she was employed by Tamas?”\n“As a mercenary, yes. To hunt down the Privileged.”\n“Likely she saw an opportunity she couldn’t ignore. She doesn’t like the\nother Predeii, and she certainly doesn’t like me. You saw how hard she\ncame after me. A woman scorned, and all that. I barely even slowed her\ndown, and I had enough sorcerous traps on this trail to kill an army.” He\ngave Taniel an annoyed look. “Too bad you sprang half of them.”\nTaniel frowned.\n“You don’t know?” Bo rubbed his temples. “God, how much do I have\nto explain? You’re layered in protective sorcery tighter than your own skin.\nNot even the strongest Privileged can create that kind of protection on a\nperson. The human body is just too complex. I wove spells on this\nmountainside strong enough to disable a god—I thought, anyway—and you\nwalked through them without even noticing. I’ve not seen sorcery like that\nbefore. Wards are weaker around a Marked, and some of the strongest\nMarked, like Tamas, can unravel wards completely, but it takes time and\npractice.”\n“That’s why you yelled at me not to come any farther.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Well…” Taniel flicked snow off his coat. There was so much he didn’t\nknow. Bo seemed to have a lot of answers, but even he couldn’t provide\nthem all. There was something going on in Adro, beyond the war and the\ncoup and everything else, that was much deeper than anyone knew. It made\nhis head hurt. “Who the pit has been weaving spells around me? I don’t\neven… ah.” Her.\nBo glanced into the cave, toward Ka poel’s sleeping form. “Tell me\n‑\nabout the savage,” he said.\nKa poel was bundled tightly in her bedroll, not a finger’s breadth of her\n‑\nvisible but for a few stray red hairs sticking out from the top. The bedroll\nrose and fell steadily with her breathing.\n“She’s a Dynize,” Taniel said. “Not from the Dynize Empire, but from\nthe Fatrastan Wilds.”\n“How’d you come across her?”\nTaniel said, “When Fatrasta declared their independence from Kez I\njoined up in the war. I spent about thirteen months using her village as a\nbase during the war in Fatrasta. Her tribe was allied with the Fatrastans. I\nranged all over southern Fatrasta from there, hitting Kez camps with my\nunit, killing Privileged and officers. Even a couple of Wardens. Her village"

Her village\nwas deep in the swamp, impossible to find unless a native showed you the\nway. It was the perfect place.\n“Another tribe lived in the same swamp. They stayed neutral through\nmost of the war, but toward the end of my time they were bought by the\nKez. They attacked Ka poel’s village. Her people managed to fight them\n‑\noff, but not before they captured twenty or thirty children.\n“The village wanted Fatrastan help getting the children back. The\nFatrastans were spread too thin. They said no. My unit was ordered out of\nthe village. I stayed behind and went with the natives to recover the\nchildren. Well, they’d killed most of them.”\nTaniel felt his mouth go dry. The memory haunted him, even now. The\nsight of dozens of children, crucified on barbed crosses, hung to rot from\nthe twisted branches of moss-covered swamp trees.\n“Why?” Bo asked.\nTaniel snorted. “They wanted to show the Kez how savage they could\nreally be. The Kez had offered barrels of whiskey, spices, rifles, horses.\nAnything they wanted in return for helping take down my unit. We’d\ncaused them a lot of grief over that year.”\n“What’d you do in that village?”\nTaniel tossed a rock off the edge of the cliff. “Justice,” he said. “I’m not\nproud. But I don’t regret it either.”\nTaniel watched wispy clouds form and roll and disappear with unseen\nair currents far off their cliff edge. He felt cold suddenly and wrapped his\narms about himself. Memories of murder touched his mind, long shoved to\nthe furthest part of his recollection and locked away. Perhaps there were a\nfew things he’d regret.\nHe shook himself out of his reverie. “Anyway,” he said. “Pole was quite\na bit older than the others, but they had taken her just the same. Probably\nbecause she was a Bone-eye. I didn’t know what that meant to them. I still\ndon’t. Yesterday was the first time I’ve seen her use her powers for more\nthan just tracking, though I’ve long known she was a Privileged of sorts.”\nTaniel scrounged about his person and his pack until he found a spare\npowder charge. He bit the end, tasting the sulfuric powder on his tongue,\nand snorted half the charge in one go.\nBo was watching him, a worried expression on his face. He edged away\nfrom the powder and scratched absently at his exposed skin.\n“Oh, don’t look at me like that,” Taniel said.\n“I’ve never seen sorcery like what she unleashed yesterday,” Bo said.\n“Nor the protection woven about you. As far as the royal cabals are\nconcerned, there are three different kinds of sorcerers: Privileged, Marked,\nand Knacked. We’ve encountered minor sorceries from witches, and\nshamans, and warlocks in the far places of the world, but nothing with the\npotency of what she showed. Does she have the third eye?”\n“Yes, I’m certain,” Taniel said. “She helps me track Privileged.”\nBo reached out and pressed a palm against Taniel’s forehead. He closed"

He closed\nhis eyes, muttering, and then jerked back. He dusted his palm off with\nsnow. “God, you reek of powder. It’s gonna make my eyes swell up and the\nspace between my fingers itch. As for your protection. Ugh. I have no idea.\nIt shrugged off my wards well enough. I don’t know if it’ll stop a bullet or a\nknife. It could just be against sorcery. Either way, don’t risk it.”\nTaniel thought back to the fight with the cave lion—with Julene. He’d\nnearly slid off the mountainside, taking a long plummet to his death. Then\nrock had sprouted from the very earth, jutting out to catch him. He\nwondered if that had been Ka poel or Bo. He didn’t ask. He didn’t want to\n‑\ngrow to depend on someone else’s protection. Bo might take credit even if\nit wasn’t his. Or even the opposite. He’d always been unpredictable.\n“Tamas sent me to kill you,” Taniel said.\n“Yeah.”\nThey didn’t look at each other.\n“I didn’t.”\n“Yeah.” Bo’s voice was wry. He gave Taniel a sidelong look, then a\nquick grin.\n“Should I have?”\nBo’s grin disappeared. “He knows about the gaes, then?”\n“It’s true?”\n“Yes.” Bo grunted. “Part of becoming a member of the royal cabal.” He\ntouched his collar gently. “I’ll have to avenge the king someday. I’ll have to\nkill Tamas.” He pulled a pendant from beneath his shirt. It was a simple\nthing, braided silver around a single gemstone. Taniel vaguely remembered\nseeing similar necklaces upon dead Kez Privileged. Not even the savages\nhad looted those.\n“Is… is that it?” Taniel asked.\n“A demon’s carbuncle,” Bo said. “Very dark stuff. You don’t want to\nknow. The gaes to protect—or avenge—the king is tied to this. Even now I\ncan feel a pull, tugging me toward Adopest. It’s not very strong. It will\ngrow stronger as time passes. I’m not sure how quickly. If I resist for too\nlong, though, it will kill me.”\n“The only way to break it is to avenge the king?”\nBo remained silent.\n“So you have to kill my father.”\nBo picked up a rock and threw it off the cliff. He didn’t look happy\nabout it.\n“We should start looking for a way to break it,” Taniel said. He hoped\nhe sounded confident. “Privileged wouldn’t attach themselves to something\nthey can’t get out of. It’s just another secret. Maybe one of the Predeii\nknows.”\nTaniel examined his friend, realizing just how much the fight yesterday\nhad taken out of him. His cheeks were gaunt. His skin looked saggy,\nwrinkled, as if he were forty years older than he was.\n“We’ll find out together,” Taniel said. “We’ll break it. I swear.”\nBo gave a tired chuckle. “My eyes are going to itch every day I’m with"

Come on.” He stood up, stretching. “We have\nto go find out if we killed that bitch.”\nChapter 20\nThe parlor of Winceslav House was a spacious affair with ornate brick\nwalls and a granite fireplace big enough to drive a pair of oxen through.\nAdamat had politely refused a seat from the butler and made his way slowly\naround the room as he waited for the lady of the house. There were a\nnumber of paintings of Lady Winceslav and her late husband, Henri\nWinceslav, as well as a single painting of the two of them with their four\nchildren. The painting was perhaps five years old, done just before the old\nduke passed away and each of the children had since been sent to boarding\nschools or resided in the country with their governesses, according to\nAdamat’s research.\nAdamat examined the floor, the walls, and the doors. A lot could be\ndiscovered about the waxing or waning fortunes of an Adran noble family\nby observing the state of their manor. When money was tight, upkeep and\nrepairs often fell behind as housing staff were let go and materials became\nscarce.\nEverything was pristine. The wood furniture and brass hangings were\npolished, the floor recently replaced, and the brickwork dusted. Her\nmercenaries had done quite well, even without Lord Winceslav to direct\nthem. They fought in Fatrasta against the Kez, against the Gurlish on behalf\nof the Brudanians, and just about everywhere else colonists from the Nine\nhad the coin to pay them.\nAdamat had to remind himself that it wasn’t Lord Winceslav alone who\nwas responsible for the Wings. It was said Lady Winceslav had a mind\nsharp enough to match most field generals and that Lord Winceslav had\nrelied heavily on her advice in all matters before his death. The lord had\nbeen clever; a man skilled with words and people. The lady was astute and\npractical; a forward-thinking planner.\nAdamat faced the door when he heard voices in the hall outside. He\nsmoothed the front of his waistcoat. A small group filed into the parlor:\nthree men and a woman, all of them in white uniforms, military sashes of\ngold across their chests. Four brigadiers of the Wings of Adom. They were\nfollowed by Lady Winceslav. She wore a riding gown of fine purple wool,\nthe collar pulled tight despite unseasonal warmth, and a matching shawl\ndraped around her shoulders. Her heeled boots clicked on the wooden floor.\nThe commanders regarded Adamat with some wariness. He recognized\ntwo of them from paintings in the great hall outside: Brigadier Ryze was an\nolder man, older even than Field Marshal Tamas, his hair as white as his\nuniform. He bore a number of visible scars on his hands and face and wore\na white sash of linen across one eye to conceal a wound received in battle\nhalf a decade ago.\nBrigadier Abrax was a woman, and her appearance could not have been\nmore opposite Lady Winceslav’s.

    "text": "half a decade ago.\nBrigadier Abrax was a woman, and her appearance could not have been\nmore opposite Lady Winceslav’s. Short blonde hair was cropped above her\nears. Her face was tanned and weather-beaten from too many campaigns in\nGurla. Her uniform matched the others’ completely, apart from the slight\nbulge of small breasts. She regarded Adamat with a coldness he rarely felt\nfrom another person.\nIntroductions were short and brisk. The younger two were Brigadier\nSabastenien and Brigadier Barat. Compared with their elders they were\nbarely weathered, and looked almost like a pair of boys playing in their\nfather’s uniforms. They couldn’t have been past their midtwenties.\nBrigadier Barat approached Adamat.\n“I’d like to see your credentials, please,” he said briskly.\nAdamat narrowed his eyes at the impertinence. “I showed them to the\nbutler when I arrived. They are in order.”\n“Even so…”\nAdamat produced an envelope and handed it to the young brigadier. He\nforced himself to check his indignation. Unlike many modern armies, a\ncommission in the Wings could not be bought. Everyone climbed the ranks.\nTo be a brigadier at that age was remarkable.\nBrigadier Barat read over Adamat’s papers. He crossed the room to his\nelders and handed them one of the papers—the note from Tamas that\ngranted him freedom in the investigation.\n“Why,” Brigadier Ryze said slowly, “does Tamas feel the need to imply\nthreats to his closest advisers?”\n“It’s just a precaution,” Adamat said. “An assurance that my\ninvestigation will proceed quickly, without any… hitches.” But there would\nbe plenty, he was sure. Tamas’s note promised that anyone attempting to\nhamper Adamat’s investigation in any way would be presumed guilty, yet a\nhundred of those notes wouldn’t prevent nobles from trying to keep their\nsecrets to themselves. Adamat wondered if Tamas would actually back up\nthe threat if he were found facedown in the ditch outside the manor.\nBrigadier Ryze handed the papers back to Brigadier Barat, who returned\nthem to Adamat. Adamat took the papers from the younger brigadier\nwithout acknowledging him and returned the papers to his pocket. He could\nalmost feel Barat seethe as he returned to his superiors. Barat had been\nplucked from the nobility, Adamat would wager. The type to look down on\nanyone beneath him and bend knee to anyone above him.\n“Get on with it,” Brigadier Ryze said. “Lady Winceslav has nothing to\nhide.”\nAdamat ran his gaze over the four brigadiers and turned pointedly to\nLady Winceslav. She sat in one corner of the parlor, to the left and behind\nher brigadiers, as if she expected to be but a witness to an exchange of\nwords. She seemed surprised when Adamat addressed her directly.\n“Did you inform the Kez of the location of your meeting with Field\nMarshal Tamas?” he said.\n“How dare you!” Brigadier Barat stood, hand going to the small sword\nat his side.\nAdamat waited for a moment, giving the other brigadiers a chance to\nreprimand their younger comrade.

Adamat pointed to Barat’s\nchair with the tip of his cane. “Sit.”\nThe brigadier blinked at him for a moment, jaw tightening, before he\nreturned to his seat.\n“Do I need to ask again, my lady?” Adamat said.\n“I did not,” Lady Winceslav said.\nAdamat allowed himself a small smile. “Let us pray you are all as\nforthright and honest.”\n“That is unnecessary,” Brigadier Abrax said. Her tone was like a\nschoolteacher’s, the words said quickly, clipped off at the end.\nAdamat paused for a moment. The brigadiers sat as if to form a shield\naround the Lady. He wondered if she was a fool to be prevented from\nspeaking, of if they were really that protective of her.\n“I am here to interview you, my lady,” Adamat said. “I’m not here to\nreceive condescension from your brigadiers. I’m sure you have servants for\nthat.” Adamat cringed inside. He was letting his annoyance do the talking.\nHe could hear his old commanding officer from his young days in the force.\nThe old man had been clear how you treat the nobility: Never antagonize\nthem.\nLady Winceslav examined Adamat from beneath the brim of her riding\nhat for a moment. Her eyes were cool, her hands composed in her lap. She\nstood and crossed the room, taking a seat just opposite Adamat.\n“Ask your questions, Inspector,” she said. Despite her polite tone, there\nwas an air of superiority to her words, and her nose was turned up slightly.\nAdamat sighed inwardly. It was the best he was going to get. “Why did\nyou support Tamas’s coup?”\n“I had many reasons,” the Lady said. “For one, the Wings of Adom\nwould have been disbanded if Manhouch had signed the Accords with the\nKez.”\n“Why? The Wings of Adom are only based in Adro. They are not\nsubservient to the king.”\n“It was a stipulation in the negotiations,” she said. She leaned forward.\n“Do you know why Ipille wants Adro under his rule?”\n“We have an abundance of natural resources,” Adamat said.\n“That is a reason, yes. But Ipille and his royal cabal fear Adro. In Kez,\nthe nation is run by the court. Nothing happens without their say. Adro is\ndifferent. Despite his flaws, Manhouch was an open-minded king. He\nallowed the union, the powder mages, and my mercenaries to all operate\nindependently of the court. This made Adro stronger. The Kez royal cabal\nfear the powder mages will make them obsolete. They fear the\nMountainwatch for their control of the major trade routes through the heart\nof the Nine. And they fear the Wings of Adom, for Henri gathered the\ngreatest military minds and men of courage from throughout the Nine and\nbought—and earned—their loyalty. The Accords stipulated that the powder\nmages would be disbanded, that the Mountainwatch would be reduced, and\nthat the Wings of Adom could no longer function from within Adro’s\nborders.” She shook her head. “I could not have that—I would not have"

The Wings of Adom are not just any mercenary\narmy. They are a secondary defense of Adro—and that is how Tamas will\nbe using them in the coming war. I will honor Henri’s vision.”\nAdamat examined the Lady. Her cheeks were flushed, her tone raised.\nShe felt strongly about her husband’s mercenaries, and about Adro. If this\nwas an act, it was a good one.\n“Are the Wings being paid for their service to Adro?”\n“They will receive a portion of the land confiscated from the nobility,”\nthe Lady said.\n“And if the Kez offer payment greater than what Adro can muster?”\nLady Winceslav drew herself up. “The Wings of Adom have never once\nswitched sides after taking a contract. I’m offended that you suggest we\nwould.”\n“My apologies,” he said. “Why else did you go along with the coup?”\nLady Winceslav composed herself. “I agreed with Tamas’s opinion of\nthe monarchy. It is an aged and corrupt institution.”\n“You yourself are a prominent member of the nobility.”\nLady Winceslav removed an embroidered pocket fan from her sleeve\nand spread it out with the flick of her wrist. She began to fan herself.\n“Despite appearances, I was not born to such a position, nor was my\nhusband. Henri was a soldier of fortune in Gurla, and I was the youngest\ndaughter of a merchant. After Henri made his first fortune in textile\nmanufacturing, he formed the Wings of Adom and purchased a duchy from\nan ailing old man without wife or children.”\nAdamat blinked. “Duke Winceslav was not his father?”\nShe read his expression and gave a light laugh. “Kresimir, no. This is\nnot common knowledge, of course. In fact, few people outside this room\nknow about it. Tamas is one of them. I tell you only in the hope that it helps\nremove me as a suspect in your mind. Tamas and I are kindred spirits. I\nwould never want him dead.”\nAdamat let his eyes travel over the four mercenary commanders. They\nstared back at him, unblinking, sharp as hawks.\n“Did you tell anyone, even the closest of confidants, about the meeting\nof the council?”\n“No,” Lady Winceslav said, her chin raised. “Tamas forbade it. Not even\nmy brigadiers knew.” She shot them a glance. “Much to their chagrin.”\nAdamat asked a few more basic questions before he sat back and folded\nhis hands in his lap. He struggled to hide a grimace. Nothing. Winceslav\nwas a lady through and through. Polite and charming, and her cards held\nclose to her chest. That bit about her husband buying the duchy… Adamat\nwas sure that any of her enemies who could have used that against her were\ntaken to the guillotine last month.\n“Thank you for being so forthright,” Adamat said, careful to inject the"

The brigadiers followed suit.\nAdamat took her offered hand and touched his forehead to it. “I will finish\nwith your staff as quickly as possible.”\n“My staff and manor grounds are yours for the day, Inspector,” she said.\n“One last thing, my lady.” Adamat paused in the doorway. “Do you\nhave reason to suspect any of the other members of the council?”\nLady Winceslav paused halfway to her chair. She sat back down. “None\nthat come immediately to mind. Charlemund is a man of Kresimir. I would\nnever suspect the vice-chancellor; Prime is an old family friend—a scholar.\nThe Proprietor must be at the top of your list. He is a criminal, after all,\ndespite his connections. I’d heard that Ondraus and Tamas have been\narguing about the city ledgers for weeks, though I’m sure there’s nothing\nmore to that.” She frowned. “I did hear that Ricard Tumblar sent a\ndelegation from his union to Kez just after the coup. Seems he wants to start\na chapter there.”\nLady Winceslav rose and bid him good day. The brigadiers filed out\nbehind her, leaving him alone with the butler.\nAdamat interviewed the house staff and groundskeepers for hours\nbefore he moved outside and began to walk around the manor grounds.\nSouSmith joined him outside, looking almost as if he’d burst through the\nchest of his new suit of clothes.\n“Well?” SouSmith asked.\n“She is a capable old vixen,” Adamat said. “Despite what her brigadiers\nwant us to think.” He glanced over his shoulder. Brigadier Barat and\nBrigadier Abrax had appeared from a side door after he exited the house.\nThey made no effort to conceal that they were following him and SouSmith.\nAdamat spied an outbuilding some ways off and veered into a field toward\nit, just to see how far the brigadiers would follow them.\n“The brigadiers are very protective of her. I think it is more likely one\nof them betrayed Tamas, rather than that she did—though she claims none\nof them knew the location of the meeting. Of course, that doesn’t rule out\nthat she was spied upon, or even…” He mulled over the idea before\nspeaking it out loud. “Or even spoke in her sleep.”\nSouSmith gave him a look.\n“I cannot rule out the idea,” Adamat said, “however improper, that she’s\nsleeping with one or more of her brigadiers. I don’t see her as the type to\nbed a woman, so that rules out Abrax.

    "text": "handsome young men, while Ryze has a particular grizzled quality that\nwomen of all ages find attractive.”\nThey followed an old track as it looped toward the horse stables and out\nof sight of the manor house through a thick forest. The two brigadiers\nremained a comfortable distance behind them.\n“Not one of the staff has seen anything suspicious in the previous two\nmonths. They remember Tamas visiting a number of times over the last\nyear, but not once since the coup. There have been no strangers about the\nplace, no one to suggest a Kez agent.” Adamat shook his head. “She will\nstart low on my list of suspects. One thing did bother me, however. She\nmentioned that Ricard Tumblar sent a delegation to King Ipille of Kez. I\nhad not heard that from any other source. It makes me wonder…” He\ntapped his cane on the ground. “We’re done here.”\nThey reached their waiting carriage a dozen paces ahead of brigadiers\nAbrax and Barat. Adamat turned at the door of the carriage and leaned\nagainst it, waiting for the pair. They approached him without hesitation.\nBrigadier Abrax spoke. She was distant, cold, as if she was thinking of a\nbattle far away and barely had the time—or interest—in Adamat. “I hope\nyour investigation has been concluded in regard to our mistress,\nInvestigator,” she said.\n“My investigation is ongoing,” Adamat replied. “I’ll be sure to inform\nLady Winceslav if she is needed further.”\n“She will not be bothered,” Barat said. Abrax gave him an unreadable\nlook, and he fell quiet.\nAdamat pretended to ignore Barat, focusing his eyes on Abrax.\nInwardly, he examined the young brigadier. Why was he so protective?\nSon-like affection for the widow, or something deeper. Aloud, he said, “I’m\nconducting an investigation. I’m not some salesman, harrying your mistress\nwithout cause. Now then.” He opened the carriage door. “I have other\nsuspects to bother.”\nBrigadier Barat stepped forward as the carriage door shut and put his\nhand on the windowsill. “Brigadiers of the Wings of Adom are not to be\ntrifled with, Inspector. Do not push the limits of your authority.”\nAdamat pushed the brigadier’s fingers from the carriage window with\nthe end of his cane. “Don’t try my patience, young man. I’ve dealt with\nworse than you.” Adamat rapped twice on the ceiling and the carriage\nbegan to move. That one would be a problem sooner or later.\n“Bo says you’ve wrapped me in protective sorcery.”\nTaniel fell into step beside Ka poel. She gave him a sidelong glance, her\n‑\ngreen eyes unreadable. She’d avoided him as they made their way off the\nmountain, by walking either far behind or far ahead. It could have been\ncoincidence that she was always bundled to the ears, unable to talk\nwhenever they passed close by. He thought not. She knew he wanted to ask\nquestions.\nAnother long glance. They kept trudging through the snow, snowshoes\nmaking the going slow and awkward, but saving them from falling through\nthe soft middle layer and having to wade through the stuff.\n“Thank you,” Taniel said."

He resisted a smile.\n“He says you’re very powerful,” Taniel said.\nShe paused for a moment and turned toward him.\n“I wonder what I did to deserve your protection.”\nKa poel reached out a bare hand and touched his face.\n‑\nTaniel had an image of Ka poel in the back of a muddy hut, naked and\n‑\nafraid, crying. They’d blinded her with some herb to keep her from trying to\nescape, and, unseeing, she had flailed about with a sharp stick, trying to kill\none of her captors, when Taniel had entered the hut. She’d recognized his\nvoice, and he’d been able to calm her. He remembered the cuts on her\nstomach and thighs, and the blood on her face.\nThe vision left Taniel gasping. He slowed down to steady himself,\nsuddenly weak in the knees. Had she done that? The vision had been from\nhis own eyes. How could she…? He shook his head. He’d ceased trying to\nguess what she could or couldn’t do.\nThey reached a lip of the trail overlooking the Mountainwatch. Bo was\na few paces ahead of them, and when Taniel heard a sharp inhalation of\nbreath from Bo, Taniel rushed up beside him.\nIt seemed the whole world spread out beneath them. Not far below,\nShouldercrown sat on the mountain ridge separating Kez and Adro, like a\ncork in the center of a dam. Below that, tiny from this height, Taniel saw\nmen.\nThey filled the basin just below Shouldercrown on the Kez side. There\nwas a sea of tents, and roads that looked like serpents leading back to the\ncenter of Kez, each one of them writhing like lines of ants.\n“An army,” Bo breathed.\n“The whole damned Grand Army.” Taniel took a snort of black powder.\nGavril grunted. “Or well near it.”\n“Where the pit did they come from?” Taniel asked. “We’ve been on the\nmountain, what, six days?”\n“Seven,” Gavril said.\n“They weren’t there when we left,” Taniel said.\nGavril just shrugged. “I was too drunk to know.”\n“They weren’t there,” Taniel said with certainty. “War was declared”—\nhe did some math in his head—“less than three weeks ago. How could they\npossibly gather the entire army in that time? And why are they here, when\nSurkov’s Alley is an easier target?”\nTaniel found they were all looking at Bo.\n“Julene,” Bo said with a sniff.\n“No,” Taniel said. “No way she knew about the army. She’s been with\nme for five weeks.”\n“It’s not her army,” Bo said. “But I’d be willing to bet she’s going to use\nit.”\n“How?”\n“Plans within plans,” Bo said. He avoided Taniel’s gaze. “She let slip\nonce that she’s well known in the Kez court.”\n“We’re not going to find her body, are we?”\nBo shook his head. “She fell on the Kez side anyway.”\n“Then what now?” Taniel asked."

A small group\nof men and women waited at the northeast gate. Closer, a group of three\nwomen were rushing up the path. Taniel didn’t even need to guess who they\nwere.\nPrivileged were magnetic to the opposite sex. Most agreed it was their\nbearing and power. It was common knowledge that their constant\ninteractions with the Else gave them incredible sex drives, so few\nPrivileged, especially the males, went without a harem. Bo was no\nexception.\nBo pushed them and their questions away with a brusque wave of his\nhand and instead went with Fesnik and another Watcher named Mozes, who\ntook him away without a word. Ka poel disappeared at some point, leaving\n‑\nTaniel alone with Gavril.\n“I want to get a better look at that army,” Gavril said.\nTaniel followed him across the bastion. He’d need to get a good look at\nthis army to report to Tamas.\nWorkers were everywhere. Taniel had not imagined so many people\ncould fit in the Mountainwatch bastion and he wondered if reinforcements\nhad been sent from Adopest. Watchers rushed around in a frenzy, most of\nthem carrying muskets or rifles. Despite the hurry, no one seemed to\nactually be doing anything. The Watch was in top shape and they’d done\ntheir preparations. Now they awaited the attack.\nThe southern wall of the fortress was an ancient bastion, designed with\nthe contours of the mountain in mind. The reality of artillery fire meant that\nthe town could be bombarded quite easily from falling munitions, while the\nwall itself would remain almost undisturbed. The points of the bastion were\nfilled with fixed gun emplacements—as many as could be crammed into the\nspace. It fairly bristled.\nTaniel and Gavril went out to the tip of the bastion. They could see the\nwhole mountainside from here and Taniel couldn’t help but wonder how\nsuicidal the Kez troops would have to be to attempt to take the\nMountainwatch. There were miles of switchbacks within clear sight of\nartillery and small arms, and only one flat approach to the main fortress—\nstraight up the road. Anywhere else, they’d have to scale the mountainside\nand then the wall, all while under fire from above.\nTaniel held up his thumb, trying to gauge distance.\n“There’s a town halfway down the mountain,” Gavril said. “Called\nMopenhague. They’ve set their advance camp there.”\n“How far?”\n“In a straight line?” Gavril said. “Three miles. Just out of range of\nartillery.”\n“Not too far for me.” Taniel would crease a few heads when the fighting\nstarted, and they’d have to move their camp back another mile.\n“Novi’s toes!” Gavril was frowning down the mountain. “Those idiots.”\nHe grabbed a young Watcher by the shoulder and pointed down the slope."

They’re within musket range, no\nproblem. Almost to our redoubts!”\nThe boy shrugged. “Sorry. They’ve just been coming up. No one’s\ngiven the order to fire. We sent a runner to Adopest when the army arrived,\nbut we haven’t gotten orders yet.”\nTaniel searched the slope for where Gavril had been pointing. There\nwas a thin ribbon of men moving up and down the switchbacks. Their\nuniforms were sand-colored with green trim. Kez infantry. They carried\ntimber and tools, and they were coming up just below the redoubts. Adran\nsoldiers in the redoubts simply watched as the men worked.\n“Pit,” Gavril said. He stormed down to the gate and out into the road.\nTaniel snatched up his rifle and a spare powder horn and followed.\nThe redoubts were a series of six small forts jutting out from the corners\nof the first few switchbacks down the mountainside. They contained one\nsmall fixed gun each and enough men to staff them with a few riflemen\nbeside. The snow had been shoveled from them recently, the big guns\nmoved out from the fortress. Taniel guessed no one had staffed those\nredoubts for a hundred years.\nTaniel and Gavril descended to the last redoubt on the mountainside.\nGavril crossed the walk over the switchback below.\n“Who’s the corporal of this redoubt?” Gavril asked.\nA man raised his hand. He was regular army, wearing the blue of\nTamas’s forces, sent up from Adopest to reinforce the Mountainwatch. He\ngave Gavril a skeptical look. “Me. Who are you?”\n“A Watcher,” he said. “Why are you letting the Kez set up artillery\nstations and”—he glanced over the wall—“sapper tunnels?”\nTaniel frowned. Why would the Kez be working on sapper tunnels?\nThey were too far out to undermine the bastion, and the redoubts could be\nrushed with enough men—certainly the preferred choice for most generals.\nThey were simply a point at which to give advance fire. As soon as the\nenemy got past the switchback below, the men would retreat to the fortress.\n“Look, I don’t have to take this from you,” the corporal said,\ninterrupting Gavril’s berating. “I may not be a Watcher, but I still outrank\nyou… whoever you are.”\nTaniel wasn’t sure of Gavril’s rank. The Mountainwatch had their own\nsystem. He pointed to his powder keg pin. “And I outrank you. Listen to\nhim,” he said.\nThe corporal scowled at Gavril, though Gavril was two heads taller and\ntwice his weight. “Well, what are we supposed to do?” the corporal asked.\nTaniel could hear the big mountaineer’s teeth grinding.\n“Your rifle loaded?” Gavril asked.\nTaniel handed him the rifle. Gavril gave it a once-over, running a finger\ndown the length of the barrel with an admiring whistle. “This,” he said."

Gavril gave it a once-over, running a finger\ndown the length of the barrel with an admiring whistle. “This,” he said.\nHe leaned out over the bulwark and fired. A sapper not fifty yards away\npitched to the ground. Kez workers scrambled for cover.\nGavril handed Taniel his rifle. “The war’s started,” he said to the\ncorporal. “Rake those bastards with shot until they’re all running scared, or\nuntil they get Privileged up here to slap you down.”\nThe corporal looked to Taniel for affirmation. “Go at it,” Taniel said.\nTaniel walked beside Gavril as they headed back to the fortress. Behind\nthem, intermittent musket fire began to pop, followed by the shouts of Kez\nsoldiers.\n“Won’t a Privileged just stamp out these redoubts without a thought?”\nTaniel asked.\nThe light artillery thumped behind them. “Go at it!” Gavril shouted to\nthe next redoubt. “Anyone that comes in range!” To Taniel, he said, “This\nwhole mountainside is warded. Every brick of those redoubts, and of the\nbastion, was slathered in protective sorcery when it was built.”\n“That was hundreds of years ago,” Taniel said, glancing back\nuncertainly. The Kez royal cabal would come soon, he had no doubt of it.\nHe wondered how long Bo could hold them off. Not long. He was just one\nPrivileged.\n“They had stronger stuff back then,” Gavril said. “They say the power\nof the Privileged has waned over the centuries since gunpowder. They used\nto be able to make wards to last a thousand years. Now it’s not often that\nwards will last past a Privileged’s death.”\nGavril seemed to know a lot about sorcerers and the like. Taniel studied\nGavril for a few moments. He barely resembled the drunk who’d guided\nTaniel up the side of the mountain a week ago.\nMozes, Bo, and Fesnik were waiting for them on the bastion when they\nreached the fortress.\n“I see you started the shooting,” Bo said. He held a cloth over his nose\nand mouth. Taniel sniffed the air. Clouds from the black powder were\nalready blowing up toward them. It would soon get far worse. Bo was not\ngoing to have a good time once the artillery lit up.\n“Someone needed to,” Gavril said. Watchers had come running at the\nsound of gunfire and now watched as the sappers began to retreat down the\nmountain. “Ho there,” Gavril said to a nearby group. “Prime the batteries.\nGive them some support. We don’t lack ammunition. I don’t want those\nsappers getting to the bottom of the mountain.”\nBo and Mozes exchanged a long look. “You’re taking charge, then?”\nMozes said.\n“Pit, no,” Gavril said. “Just prepping the men for Jaro. Where is he?”\nMozes shook his head. “Something’s taken him. He’s far sicker than we\nimagined. Can barely move. Doctor says he might not live out the night.”"

Doctor says he might not live out the night.”\nGavril’s eyes looked sad for a moment, and then it was gone behind a\nstony façade. “So be it.” He whirled on one foot and marched down along\nthe bulwarks. “You there! Bring those balls. More powder kegs!” He was\noff, giving orders, throwing about his ham-sized fists.\n“Wait,” Taniel said. Jaro must have been the Watchmaster. “He’s\nsecond in command?”\n“Used to be Watchmaster, before he started drinking,” Bo said. Mozes\nhad gone off after Gavril, and Fesnik went to fetch a rifle.\n“Sure, he was a competent guide, but… him?”\n“Yes. Him.” Bo shook his head. “He, uh… well, it’s not my place to tell\nyou. Gavril’s our man, don’t worry. Ah,” he added, glancing over the\nbulwark. “I see they’re getting ready to hit back.”\nA company of men had left Mopenhague. Another company was lining\nup behind them, and then another. It looked like they were going to try an\nearly rush. It would be close to dark before they got close enough to take a\nshot. But the war had started.\n“Next!” a man called.\nNila shuffled to the head of the line. She stood on the front step of the\nHouse of Nobles, at the heart of the Adran army in their new headquarters.\nSomewhere behind her, the guillotines that had taken the nobility were long\ngone, but the stains from the blood they’d shed still remained. The sun beat\ndown on her shoulders, the wind mussing her auburn curls. She smoothed\nher hair against her head. In her new dress she looked a hundred times\nricher than anyone else in the unemployment line.\nThe man behind the table looked her up and down. “You don’t look like\nyou need a job,” he said. He wore a blue Adran army uniform with the staff\nemblem of a quartermaster on his breast beneath three service stripes.\n“I’m a laundress,” Nila said, holding her head high. “I keep my clothes\npristine.”\n“Laundress, heh? Dole, the Noble Warriors of Labor need any\nlaundresses?”\nA man sitting behind the next table over looked up at Nila. “No,” he\nsaid. “Boss says we have too many already.”\nNila shifted her skirt around. “I heard the army was looking for\nlaundresses.”\n“Lass, a girl with your looks should not join the army.” The\nquartermaster leaned back. “It’s just a bad idea.”\n“I heard they pay well. Provide a tent and everything. I could make ten\ntimes what a soldier does.”\n“That’s true,” the quartermaster said. “But I wouldn’t brag about it if I\nwere you. We pay better than the union for someone with skills. Are you\nsure?”\n“I need the money,” Nila said. She jerked her head toward the empty\nspot the guillotines had once held. “My last employer wound up losing his\nhead, and no one else pays as well.”"

Something tells me you can handle yourself. Still, I’ll put you working\nfor the officers. Safer with them. Usually. Can you sew? I think the field\nmarshal needs a seamstress.”\n“That would be perfect,” Nila said, smiling the first real smile she’d had\nin weeks.\nChapter 21\nTamas awoke to the sound of his own labored gasps. He sat up, leaning on\nhis elbows, struggling to breathe. It felt like a millstone sat upon his chest.\nHe kicked away the blankets that were wrapped around his feet and sat up,\nleaning over the edge of his bed.\nHe slept in his office on the top floor of the House of Nobles these days,\nforsaking the thick cushions of the royal sofa for a simple but comfortable\nsoldier’s cot set up in the corner of the room. The cot, heavy-duty canvas,\nwas soaked through with his sweat, as were his bedclothes and hair. He\nwrapped his arms about himself, suddenly shivering as his sweat began to\ncool. The clock, visible by bright moonlight, said it was half past three in\nthe morning.\nHis dreams came back to him, like memories of long years ago, broken\nand blurry. His hands shook when he thought of them, and it wasn’t from\nthe cold. Men died in his dreams—soldiers he’d known his whole life,\nfriends and acquaintances, even enemies. Everyone he’d ever known. They\nlined the rim of South Pike Mountain and one by one they leapt into a fiery\ncauldron. Taniel was there too, though his fate was obscured. He shuddered.\nWhere was Vlora in those dreams? He’d seen Sabon leap into that volcano,\nbut where was Olem?\nTamas took a shaky breath. He made his way to the balcony window\nand stood for a moment, watching the full moon. The night sky was empty\nexcept for a single ribbon of cloud that formed a perfect circle around the\nmoon. God’s eye. Tamas began to shiver again, violently, until the shivers\nturned to shudders. He gripped the wall with both hands until it passed.\nHe heard a familiar whine and looked down. “Hrusch,” he said to the\nhound. “I’m all right. Where’s Pitlau—” He stopped, the name disappearing\nin an involuntary cough. “Right. Sorry, boy.” He bent, offering the hound\nhis hand. “I’ll take you on a hunt soon.

Olem stirred in a chair beside the door. Across from him, Vlora slept\nin another chair, leaning on her rifle, snoring softly. Farther down the hall a\npair of guards waited beneath the lamplight. His commanders had doubled\nthe guard after the Warden’s assassination attempt.\n“Sir,” Olem said. He stubbed out a cigarette on the arm of his chair.\n“Don’t you ever sleep?”\n“No, sir. That’s why you hired me.”\n“It was a joke, Olem.”\n“I gathered.”\n“Things quiet?” Tamas asked.\n“Very, sir. Not a peep in the place.” Olem’s voice was quiet, subdued.\nTamas nodded at Vlora. “What’s she doing here?”\n“Worried about you, sir.”\nTamas sighed.\n“Are you OK, sir?”\nTamas gave a nod. “Bad dreams.”\n“My grandmammie used to say bad dreams were bad omens,” Olem\nsaid.\nTamas glared at the soldier. “Thanks, that makes me feel much better.\nI’m going to get something to eat.” He shuffled down the hall.\nOlem gave him some space, trailing along at ten paces all the way down\nthe stairs. The trip six floors down to the kitchens seemed much longer in\ndark corridors, and Tamas had to admit that Olem was some comfort when\nshadows in doorways played upon his imagination, reaching for him from\nthe darkness. He jumped once, thinking he saw the hunkering figure of a\nWarden waiting in a corner. Closer inspection revealed a coal-burning\nstove.\nTamas had hoped to find in the kitchens some scraps from last night’s\ndinner and be back up in his room in minutes, yet when he approached the\nkitchen, he saw the low glow of ovens and smelled fresh bread. His mouth\nbegan to water—a sure sign he was near Mihali’s cooking. He stepped into\nthe room, pausing at a sight he didn’t expect.\nTwo women stood at one of the stoves. They worked over an enormous\npan, as big as a wagon wheel, cracking eggs and tossing the shells to the\nside. Mihali stood just behind them—just behind them, his body pressed\nclose to theirs, an arm on either side of the two women, hands moving\nnimbly above the pan. He added a dash of salt, then one hand dipped down,\neliciting a startled giggle from one of the women before appearing again\nwith his knife and a whole green pepper, nimbly slicing it into the pot.\nTamas cleared his throat. The two girls jumped, eyes growing wide at\nthe sight of Tamas. Mihali stepped away from them, moving smoothly\ndespite his girth, and grinned.\n“Field Marshal!” he said. He wiped his hands on his apron and patted\neach girl on the cheek, then headed over to Tamas. “You look like you\nhaven’t had a good night.”\n“You look like you have,” Tamas said. “I’ve seen it all now: seduction\nby way of omelet.”\nIt was hard to tell in such poor light, but Mihali seemed to turn red in"

    "text": "“You look like you have,” Tamas said. “I’ve seen it all now: seduction\nby way of omelet.”\nIt was hard to tell in such poor light, but Mihali seemed to turn red in\nthe face. “Simply early-morning lessons, Field Marshal,” he said. “Bellony\nand Tasha are the most promising of my pupils. They deserve extra\nattention.”\n“Pupils?” Tamas asked. “I thought they were assistants.”\n“Every assistant is a pupil. If they don’t learn, what good are they?\nEvery master must be prepared to be bettered, as my father was before me.\nSomeone will create more amazing dishes than I someday. Perhaps it will\nbe one of these two.”\n“I have doubts about that,” Tamas said. He glanced toward the two\nwomen. One was older, perhaps in her thirties, a handsome-faced woman\nwith a body rounded in all the right places. The other was young and\nslightly plump with dimples on her cheeks. They watched Mihali more than\nthey watched their pan, with expressions Tamas only saw on two types of\npeople: young lovers and religious sycophants. Tamas wondered which\nthey were.\n“You are not sleeping well?” Mihali asked.\nTamas shrugged. “Bad dreams.”\n“Bad omens, more like.”\nOlem’s soft voice came from the doorway. “I told him.”\nMihali gave Tamas a critical look-over. “Warm milk.”\n“That’s never worked for me,” Tamas said. “Do you ever sleep? It’s\nthree in the morning.”\n“Three forty-five,” Mihali said, though there were no clocks in the\nkitchen. “I’ve needed little sleep since I was a boy. Papa told me it was\nbecause of the god’s touch in me.”\n“Your father believed you?” Tamas asked. “I don’t mean to be rude.\nYou’d said before that he told you to keep quiet about being Adom reborn.”\n“No offense taken.” Mihali edged over to an empty table and began to\nproduce a number of small, clay spice bottles from his apron pockets. There\nwere no labels, but he set them down in a very specific order on the table.\n“He believed me. He just knew of the problems I’d face if it became public\nknowledge.”\n“And now?” Tamas said. “You’ve told me, and I think word is\nspreading about your claims.” He glanced at the two women. Which was it?\nReligious adoration, or love? Or both? They still watched Mihali, until one\nof them noticed that the omelet was smoking and turned around with a cry\nof dismay.\nA smile played upon Mihali’s lips. He produced a mortar and pestle and\nbegan to grind herbs together. “My claims?” Mihali said. “You don’t\nbelieve me, do you?”\n“I… don’t know,” Tamas said. “It’s a lot to swallow. I’ve seen what\nyou do with food—how you can make it appear. I’ve never heard of any\nsorcery like that. And I’ve seen the glow of the Knack around you.”\nMihali seemed startled by this. “You noticed?”\n“Yes, well, you did it right in front of Olem and me.”"

No one is supposed to notice that. I usually pay better attention.\nPapa told me to hide it when I was a boy. Said the royal cabals or the\nChurch would come for me if they found out.”\nTamas examined Mihali’s face for any sign of a lie. Mihali was\nconcentrating on his work, combining herbs until he was satisfied with the\nresult. He produced a dark powder and added it to the mixture. “Tasha,” he\nsaid. “Warm some goat’s milk, please.”\n“I thought you were doing it on purpose,” Tamas said slowly. “Perhaps\nto convince us of your… godhood.”\nMihali gave him a shy smile. “I’ve never been a flashy god,” he said. “I\nleave that to Kresimir.”\n“You’ve also been serving dishes very foreign to Adro,” Tamas said.\n“We don’t have eels in the Adsea, for instance. You use expensive spices\nlike they were simply flour or water. I served in Gurla for a time. I know\nwhat these things can cost, and I know Ondraus doesn’t approve this kind\nof money for food. Is that your Knack? Producing food from thin air?”\nMihali scratched his thin mustache. “Yes, I’ve been kind of obvious,\nhaven’t I? Should I… hide myself?”\n“Maybe,” Tamas said. Mihali had the Knack, no doubt. Tamas might\nneed his powers someday. Did he humor the madman chef? “Remain quiet,\nI think. As a precaution.”\n“May I ask you what your dreams were about?”\n“I remembered them when I first awoke,” Tamas said. “But now they’re\nfleeting. I think everyone I knew—no, not everyone, but most of the people\nI knew stood on the rim of South Pike and jumped into the mountain. My\nson was there too, though I don’t know what happened to him and…” He\nstopped, a memory coming back to him. “Someone stood on the rim with\nus. Someone I’d never seen before. His eyes were like fire, his hair like\ngold tinsel. He was urging everyone to jump in, and he held a knife to\nTaniel’s throat.”\n“Can I tell you something?” Mihali said softly.\nTamas took a step closer to hear him better. “Certainly.”\nMihali took a cup from one of the women. “Thank you, Tasha,” he said.\n“I’ve been listening to the city.” Mihali added his mixture of herbs to the\nwarm milk and stirred it with one thick finger. He handed it to Tamas.\nAlmost absently, Tamas took a sip. His eyes widened. He’d had Fatrastan\nchocolate once or twice. It was too bitter. This had a similar taste, but\nsweeter, and with a hot, peppery bite. Spice burned his tongue and herbs\nsoothed it, and it rushed warmly down his throat like the finest of brandy.\nHe tilted the cup back, draining the last drop."

He\nshouldn’t have any problem sleeping now.”\n“Adamat, my old friend!”\nRicard Tumblar stood in the doorway to a small office, arms spread\nwide. The years had changed Ricard since Adamat had last seen him. His\nfull head of curly brown hair had retreated halfway across his scalp and was\ntouched with wisps of gray. He wore his beard long in the fashion of\nFatrastan settlers. His expensive suit of camel hair was rumpled as if it had\nbeen slept in, and his cravat was askew. Adamat embraced his old friend.\n“It’s good to see you, Ricard,” Adamat said.\nRicard grinned ear to ear. He took Adamat by the shoulders, looking\nhim in the face like a long-lost brother. “How have you been?”\n“Well enough,” Adamat said. “Yourself?”\n“I certainly can’t complain. Please, sit.” He led Adamat into the office.\nIt was a jumbled mess of books, half-empty bottles of brandy, and dirty\nplates of food. Ricard swept a pile of newspapers off a chair and went\naround behind his desk. He slid open a window with a grunt.\n“Coel!” he shouted out the window. “Coel, bring us some wine. A bottle\nof the Pinny! Two glasses—no, better make it two bottles.”\nHe slid the window shut behind him, but not before the small room\nfilled with the smell of dead fish and the brackish water of the Adsea.\nRicard wrinkled his nose and produced a match from his breast pocket,\nlighting the half-burned butt of incense on a shelf above his desk. “I can’t\nabide that smell,” he said. “It’s everywhere down here, and we’re a half\nmile from the docks. But”—he shrugged—“what can I do? I have to be near\nwhere the action is.”\n“I’ve heard great things about your progress with the union,” Adamat\nsaid. Not long after they graduated school, Ricard had started his first trade\nunion. It had failed, as well as half a dozen others, perhaps because of the\nlack of manpower or because the police had been called in to shut him\ndown. Ricard had been jailed five times. But persistence paid off, and five\nyears ago Manhouch legalized the first trade union in the Nine.\nRicard’s smile grew wider, if possible. “The Noble Warriors of Labor.\nWe’ve opened three chapter houses since the Elections, and we’re in talks\nwith city councils to open six more by the end of the year. We’ve over a\nhundred thousand members, and my number crunchers tell me that is just"

    "text": "with city councils to open six more by the end of the year. We’ve over a\nhundred thousand members, and my number crunchers tell me that is just\nthe beginning. We could have a million members in another few years,\nmaybe more. We’ve unionized metallurgy, coal coking, mining—all of\nAdro’s biggest industries.”\n“Not all of them,” Adamat said. “I hear Hrusch Avenue is giving you\nproblems.”\nRicard snorted. “Damned gunsmiths don’t want to unionize.”\n“Can’t blame them,” Adamat said. “They already produce half the\nweapons used in all the Nine. They’re not worried about competition.”\n“And it’d be the whole world if they unionized! Organization is key.\nBah,” Ricard said. “What we’re really excited about is the canal going over\nthe Charwood Pile and through Deliv. When that’s finished, we’ll have a\ndirect route to the ocean from Adro, and there will be no limit on our\nproduction capabilities. Adro will finally have a shipping lane to the\nocean.” He suddenly made a face. “But dear me, it’s rude to talk about my\nfortunes like this…” Ricard trailed off awkwardly.\nAdamat waved dismissively. “You speak of my failed business? Think\nnothing of it. It was a gamble to begin with, and I bet the wrong way. I\ncould blame it on the price of paper, or the stalwart competition…”\n“Or the exploding printing press.”\n“Or that,” Adamat said. “But I’ve still got my family and my friends, so\nI’m a rich man.”\n“How is Faye?” Ricard asked.\n“Quite well,” Adamat said. “She’s staying out in the country until things\nhave stabilized a little more here in the capital. I’ve been thinking of having\nher remain until the war’s over, in fact.”\nRicard nodded. “War is the pit.”\nA young man with scrawny arms and old, cast-off clothing entered the\nroom with a bottle of wine and a pair of crystal wineglasses.\n“I said two, damn you!” Ricard said.\nThe young man seemed unperturbed by Ricard’s shouting. “There was\nonly one left.” He let the platter drop on Ricard’s desk with a clang and beat\na hasty retreat, dodging a cuff from Ricard’s fist.\n“Impossible to find good help,” Ricard said, steadying the wobbling\nbottle of wine.\n“Indeed.”\nRicard poured the wine. The goblets were dirty, but the wine was\nchilled. They drank two glasses each before exchanging another word.\n“You know why I’m here?” Adamat asked.\n“Yes,” Ricard said. “Ask your questions; I’m no fop to take offense.\nYou’ve got a job to do.”\nThis would be a relief, Adamat decided. He leaned forward. “Do you\nhave any reason to see Field Marshal Tamas dead?”\nRicard scratched his beard. “I suppose. He’s been grumbling lately that\nhe wants to see a reduction in the size of the union. Says we’re gaining too\nmuch power, too fast.” He spread his hands. “If he decides to put a cap on\nour manpower, or to tax our earnings heavily, it could cause a big problem\nfor the Warriors.”"

    "text": "much power, too fast.” He spread his hands. “If he decides to put a cap on\nour manpower, or to tax our earnings heavily, it could cause a big problem\nfor the Warriors.”\n“Big enough to have him killed?”\n“Certainly. But one has to weigh the benefits and risks. Tamas is\ntolerant of the unions—he supports their existence, despite our being\noutlawed for almost a thousand years now. Manhouch only allowed me to\nset up the Warriors because of the exorbitant taxes he planned on getting\nfrom us. We were able to dodge enough of them to make it cost-effective\nfor us to exist.”\n“If you could exist under Manhouch, why did you support the coup?”\n“A number of Manhouch’s accountants were taking a closer look at our\nbooks. They realized they weren’t getting nearly as much in taxes as they’d\nplanned, and his advisers were encouraging him to have us disbanded\nentirely. The nobility hated us. They hate having to pay workers more, even\nif it means higher production. Even if Manhouch hadn’t had us disbanded,\nthe Accords put Adro under Kez colonial law—which would have found\nme and the rest of the union bosses in prison or worse, and the Warriors\ndisbanded anyways, our property confiscated.”\n“You said there would be risks for you, in having Tamas killed?”\nAdamat said.\n“Mostly questions. I don’t have a lot of friends in the council. Lady\nWinceslav tolerates me. The reeve hates me because my accountants are\nalmost as good as his and the Diocel has excommunicated me twice. Prime\nLektor thinks I’m a fool, and the Proprietor—well, the Proprietor enjoys the\nbribes the union pays him. If Tamas were killed, that would leave me with\nonly two supporters on the council, both of whom could turn on me.”\nAdamat took a sip of his wine. It may be that one already has, he\nthought, remembering what Lady Winceslav had said.\n“Word has it you sent a delegation to Ipille.”\nRicard sat back. “Who told you that?”\n“You know better than to ask me that.”\n“Bah. You and your sources. I forget sometimes that you seem to know\neverything. Even things done in the deepest of secrecy.”\n“So you did?”\nRicard shrugged. “Of course. Not even Tamas knows. Not that I’m\nhiding anything,” he said quickly, throwing up a hand.\n“Why the secrecy if you aren’t hiding anything?” Adamat found himself\non edge. Old friend or not, if Ricard was dealing behind Tamas’s back,\nfriendship was cheap currency.\n“I told you we might make a million members?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well, imagine if that could be ten million. Or a hundred million?”\n“You’re talking every working man in all the Nine.”\nRicard nodded solemnly. “The Warriors sent a small delegation to\nIpille. Nothing so underhanded as trying to sell out Adro, mind you. Simply\na letter of intent that the Warriors want to spread outside Adro throughout\nthe whole Nine. It’s well known the Kez outnumber us, but they don’t have\nanything to match our industry. We offered a number of small incentives if\nthey let us start a chapter house in one of their cities.”"

    "text": "the whole Nine. It’s well known the Kez outnumber us, but they don’t have\nanything to match our industry. We offered a number of small incentives if\nthey let us start a chapter house in one of their cities.”\n“I see,” Adamat said. He examined the inside of his wineglass. He\nunderstood perfectly why Ricard had done it in secrecy. With the war on,\nTamas would not want even an inkling of anyone helping the Kez. And the\nKez would have much to gain from the unions. Kez was primarily an\nagricultural country. They had yet to embrace industry, not the way Adro\ndid, so they were behind in technology and production despite their\nimmense population. If the Warriors spread to Kez, their knowledge of\nAdran manufacturing would spread with them. As Ricard said, the Kez\ncould not match Adran industry. Yet.\n“Have you received an answer?”\nRicard made a face. He looked around his desk, then on the shelves, and\nfinally found what he was looking for underneath a crust of half-eaten\nbread. He tossed a paper into Adamat’s lap.\nIt bore the royal seal of King Ipille of Kez. Adamat ran his eyes across\nthe contents.\n“They rejected you.”\n“With venom,” Ricard said. “My men were thrown from the palace by\ntheir belts. The Kez are fools. Idiots. They remain in the last century, while\nthe rest of the world already looks to the next. Damned nobles.”\nAdamat considered this. This lead was gone, anyway. Unless there were\nfurther negotiations going on beneath the surface—such a thing wasn’t\nunheard of. Adamat would dig deeper if need be. Ricard was not such a\ngood friend that Adamat wouldn’t see whether his story held water.\nRicard drained the last of the wine straight from the bottle. He set it\ndown on the desk on its side and spun it. “Maies left me last month, right\nafter the coup.”\nMaies was his sixth wife in twenty years. Adamat couldn’t help but\nwonder what he’d done this time.\n“Are you all right?”\nRicard’s eyes were on the spinning bottle. “Doing fine. An office near\nthe dockyards has its perks. I found a pair of twins…” He held his hands\nout in front of his chest. “I could introduce you—”\nAdamat cut him off. “I’m a happily married man—and I want it to stay\nthat way.” Ricard wasn’t the type of man to share. Adamat couldn’t even be\nsure what kind of an offer that was. “What do you think of the other\ncouncillors?” Adamat asked, changing the subject.\n“Personally?”\n“I don’t care if you like them. I care if you think one of them would plot\nagainst Tamas.”\n“Charlemund,” Ricard said without hesitation. “That man’s a cave lion\nin the henhouse.” He shook his head. “You’ve heard stories about his villa,\nright? A pleasure villa for the high and mighty just outside of the city.”\n“Rumors,” Adamat said. “Nothing more.”\n“Oh, they’re true,” Ricard said. “Makes me blush, and I’m no innocent\nvirgin. Any man with appetites like that has designs for the country. Mark\nmy words.”"

Any solid suspicions?”\n“No. Of course not. He’s a dangerous man. The Church already speaks\nout against the Warriors. Says we’re going against Kresimir’s will by not\nrolling over and letting the nobility work us to death for nothing. I’m not\nputting my nose in that.”\n“What about Ondraus?” Adamat said.\nRicard became very still. “Watch that one,” he said. “He’s more than he\nseems.”\nAn odd warning from Ricard.\n“Well, let me know if you get any evidence to convict the arch-diocel,”\nAdamat said, picking up his hat.\nRicard put his finger in the air. “Wait,” he said. “I just remembered\nsomething. There were rumors a few years back that Charlemund was\ninvolved in some kind of a cult.” He put his hand to his head. “I can’t for\nthe life of me think of the name.”\n“A cult,” Adamat said good-naturedly. Ricard was reaching. He\nobviously didn’t like the man. “Let me know if you remember. I’ll need\naccess to your books, and to any property the union owns down by the\ndocks.”\n“Hmph,” Ricard said. “You’ll need an army to wade through all of that.”\n“Still…”\n“Oh, you’re welcome to it. I’ll spread the word around with my boys\nthat you’re not to be bothered and that your questions are to be answered.”\nAdamat and SouSmith spent the rest of the day and much of the next\nwalking the docks and warehouses. Nearly everyone in that district\nbelonged to the Warriors of Labor, so Adamat asked a lot of questions. As\nhe suspected, though, they took him nowhere. He wound up speaking to\nwell over three hundred people. There had been suspicions and half-truths\nand lies and fingers pointed, but it all turned in on itself in a great big circle.\nRicard had been right—it would take an army to sort through all of it.\nThe only thing he could confirm was that Kez agents had been coming\ninto the country through these docks, over the Adsea. He dropped by\nTamas’s military headquarters at the end of the second day and left a list of\nnames and ships for Tamas’s soldiers to check out, but went home with\nnothing further in the search for Tamas’s traitor.\nHe knew his work may have helped avert another assassination attempt,\nbut he couldn’t help but feel he was putting his hands into murky, shark-\nfilled waters. He was but one man, and Tamas’s enemies could strike from\nanywhere and at any time.\nChapter 22\nThe pealing of the Watch bell brought Taniel out of a restless sleep and had\nhim on his feet in moments.

Taniel ran past the rows of tables, their\nchairs set upside down on top of them, and came out into the street.\nHe only paused there to pull on his shirt and adjust his rifle kit. Boots\ncame on next, and by the time he was up, men and women poured from the\nrest of the buildings on the street. Taniel joined the flow of those heading\ntoward the southern wall of the bastion.\n“You heard the alarm?” Fesnik asked, dropping in beside Taniel. He’d\ntaken a liking to Taniel in the two weeks since he’d come down off the\nmountain with Bo. Taniel couldn’t imagine why. He’d cracked one of the\nman’s teeth when he put a pistol in his mouth all those weeks ago.\nTaniel rolled his eyes. Of course he heard it. Half of Adro heard it, and\nthe damned bells were still going. “Yeah,” he said.\n“Think it’s the big push?”\n“Don’t know.”\nThe young Watcher looked far too excited for the prospect. They’d had\nnothing but potshots at the Kez soldiers since fire was first exchanged. The\nKez army had simply lain out on the fields, readying itself for…\nsomething… out of range of artillery. Their Privileged had stayed\ncompletely out of sight—a fact that irked Taniel—though he’d had his\nshare of shots at Wardens. Killing one of them in a single shot, though, took\nmore luck than skill.\nTaniel fell into a spot on the bulwark and got comfortable. He snorted a\npinch of powder to sweep away the last of his sleep and squinted into the\nmorning sun.\n“They’ve got the sun with them,” Taniel said.\n“Bastards,” Fesnik grunted.\nTaniel said, “We’ve always known they’d attack in the morning. Their\nadvantage will turn against them in the afternoon, when they’re looking up\nthe mountain to make a shot.”\nThe sun had barely begun peeking out from the distant hills. The\nmorning air was chilly despite summer’s onset. The snow had disappeared\nfrom the lower parts of Pike’s skirt and the road up the southern side would\nbe soggy—it’d be trampled to a mud-covered slide when Kez troops began\ntheir ascent. Taniel wondered at the Kez strategy.\nThe bells fell away from the town behind them. Quiet came, save for a\nfew nervous whispers and the rattle of gear. Cannons were loaded, muskets\nreadied. Men and heavy guns lined the entire bulwark with just enough\nroom between them to work. Taniel did not envy the enemy.\n“By Kresimir,” Fesnik said, squinting. “They’ve got enough troops to\nthrow men and bullets at us until the end of times.”\n“They’re welcome to try,” said a Watcher woman on Taniel’s right. He\nthought he recognized the voice and took a glance. It was Katerine, one of\nBo’s women. She was a serious woman, not Bo’s type at all, tall and thin\nwith raven hair and a severe voice.

Being a powder mage didn’t reduce the glare of\nthe morning sun. He felt a tug on his sleeve. Ka poel stood beside him and\n‑\npointed down the slope.\nTaniel tried to follow her finger, searching the hillside and the plains\nbelow. Then he saw it. Down near Mopenhague. The town had long been\nabandoned in favor of a headquarters farther back. Not anymore. A tower\nhad been erected during the night. It stood three stories high, made of\nwooden beams and sitting upon a sled, with a full team of oxen ready to\npull it.\nTaniel felt his heart jump. “A Privileged Tower,” he said. He opened his\nthird eye to find out for certain. A glow surrounded the tower in the Else,\nthick enough to blot out individual auras.\n“It’s just a pile of sticks,” Fesnik said. “One good shot from a big gun\nand it’s splinters.”\nKa poel snorted. Taniel didn’t think she’d ever seen a Privileged\n‑\nTower, but she could definitely sense the sorcery around the thing.\nKaterine seemed worried. She gave Taniel an uncertain look.\n“Don’t get your hopes up on that,” Taniel said. “Privileged Towers are\nmore a bundle of sorcery than sticks.” He gave the thing a once-over. His\nthird eye found a field of colors below, a thousand pastels all smeared\ntogether and mixed up. The tower glowed like a thousand torches. Looking\nat it gave him a headache. He closed his third eye. “They’ve been weaving\nwards into that thing for the last few weeks. I don’t think one of these has\nbeen built for a long time. It takes an entire royal cabal, and when it’s\nfinished…”\n“OK, but what the pit does it do?” Fesnik asked. Taniel gave the young\nWatcher a glance. Fesnik’s musket barrel wavered.\n“It’ll protect the soldiers as they come up the hill,” Taniel said. “And\nthe Privileged riding it.”\n“I still can’t see the thing,” Fesnik said, shielding his eyes.\n“You will soon enough.” Taniel lifted his rifle and spun about. “Any\nidea where Bo is?”\nFesnik shook his head.\n“With Gavril,” Katerine said. “Above the gate.”\nThe largest of the bulwarks was above the southeast gate. It stuck out\nfrom the main wall, looming over the side of the mountain with twenty\ncannon and artillery pieces. Taniel found Gavril right out on the point of the\nbulwark, his eyes shaded against the sun, leaning out as if waiting for a\nbullet to strike him. Bo stood a few paces back, frowning at the hillside\nbelow.\n“Privileged Tower,” Taniel said.\n“I know. I’ve been wondering what they’re up to. Thought they were\nwaiting for more men.” He grunted and tugged at his collar. “I wasn’t\nexpecting this.”\n“I’ve never seen one before,” Taniel said. “Just heard stories.”\n“I’d be surprised if you had.

A siege of a shah’s palace in Gurla by Kez forces.\nAllied with Adro, no less.” He snorted. “The Adran and Kez royal cabals\nworked together to build three Privileged Towers. Won them the battle, and\nthe war.”\n“Why’d they need them?” Taniel asked.\nBo gave him a long look. “Because the shah’s palace was guarded by a\nGurlish god.”\nTaniel felt a chill in his chest. It wasn’t caused by the wind. “You’re\njoking. A god?”\n“Royal cabal secrets, my friend,” Bo said, tapping the side of his nose.\n“A young god. Young and naïve.” Bo’s voice was wistful.\n“Not a story you’ll hear in the history books,” Gavril added. He climbed\ndown from the bulwark and faced them, placing a looking glass back in his\npocket. He wore the assorted furs of a mountain man with brown leather\nboots and a matching vest that barely fit across his chest. The vest was old\nand faded, and Taniel could practically smell the dust from it, as if it had\nbeen sitting in the back of a closet or bottom of a chest. On the left breast it\nhad an emblem of the Mountainwatch—three triangles, a bigger one with a\nhalo flanked by two smaller ones. A Watchmaster’s vest.\nGavril, the town drunk, was the Watchmaster. It still boggled Taniel’s\nmind.\n“What do you think?” Bo said, nodding over the edge of the bulwark.\n“I don’t like it.” Gavril rubbed at the stubble on his chin. He’d shaved\noff his beard since he took over as Watchmaster. It grew back in quickly,\nand he only bothered to shave every few days. “A Privileged Tower means\nthey’ve got the whole cabal down there.”\n“Or something worse,” Bo said.\n“Julene,” Taniel said.\nThey exchanged unhappy glances.\n“I’ve seen her unleash sorceries,” Taniel said. “Powerful stuff.”\n“Bah,” Bo said. “She held back. You don’t know the half of it.”\n“Then she’ll sweep this fortress aside.”\n“Don’t care who she is,” Gavril said. “She’ll not get rid of us so easily.\nSorceries as old as she is anchor this fortress to the mountain. They’ve been\nwoven into every brick and every handful of dirt and rock. This is the\nMountainwatch.”\nBo gave Gavril an annoyed look. “She’s not to be underestimated\neither,” he said. “She may be weakened by our fight. She took a beating up\non that mountaintop that would have killed half a royal cabal. Not to\nmention the fall. She probably left a crater in the ground where she hit.”\nA murmur went through the troops lining the bulwark. Taniel went to\nthe edge to look over.

    "text": "Squinting through the glare, Taniel could see the foot of the mountain\nwrithing with motion. The whole army had moved up during the night, just\nout of bombardment range. It seemed like one giant, unorganized mass, but\nas Taniel watched, it began to form into ranks. He saw them then, the\nbanners of the Kez Cabal. They were huge as bedsheets beside a shirt\ncompared with the banners of the nobility and the royal house. They rose,\naided by sorcery, above the Kez ranks, untouched by wind, their broad sides\npointed toward the Watch. They displayed a white snake in a field of grain\nthat was the Kez symbol of power. The snake writhed and moved as Taniel\nwatched. Sorcery again. The snake’s mouth opened, and it spit venom\ntoward the mountain fortress.\nTaniel glanced at Bo.\n“Tricks,” Bo said. “Illusions. Nothing dangerous. Yet.”\n“Right.”\nThe Privileged Tower began to creep up the road. Soldiers poured past\nit on either side, marching in step, the steady snare of the drummer boys\nreverberating up the mountain, the creak of harnesses as a thousand horses\nbegan to pull cannons. A trumpet sounded. The ascent began.\nUp until now there had been feints and prods, a few companies of\nsoldiers rushing the bulwark and then falling back to the relative safety of\nthe natural breastworks created by the roads cut into the side of the\nmountain. Adran soldiers in the outer redoubts had retreated several times,\nbut retaken their redoubts without a fight each time when the enemy fell\nback.\nTaniel could tell this was no feint. The real attack had begun. There\nwould be no rest until one side was destroyed.\nHe felt a tug at his sleeve. Ka poel pulled him to the side and offered\n‑\nhim a satchel. It was the size of a cannonball and felt as heavy as one.\n“What the pit, Pole? Ugh, what is this?” He set the bag on the ground\nand looked inside. It was full of bullets, enough for half a unit. He frowned\nat Ka poel. “Thanks?”\n‑\nKa poel rolled her eyes. She struck her fist to her chest—a symbol she\n‑\nused for Privileged, and then mimed shooting a rifle. Taniel felt a smile\nslowly spread on his face as he began to understand.\n“What’s that?” Bo asked, looking over Ka poel’s shoulder.\n‑\n“Bullets,” Taniel said. He pulled one out and held it up to the light. It\nwas a standard lead musket ball about the width of a man’s thumb. Upon\ncloser inspection one could see a dark red band of color across the middle\nof the bullet. Bo reached for the ball, which Taniel snatched back. “You\ndon’t want to touch this,” he said. “It’s a redstripe.”\nBo gave the bullet a skeptical look. “A what?”\n“These have been charmed by a Bone-eye—the Dynize sorcerers,”\nTaniel said. “We used these in the Fatrastan war. Killed a number of\nPrivileged with them.”\n“How’s it charmed?” Bo said. He peered at the bullet, keeping his\ndistance."

From what I understand, they take a lot of\nenergy to make.” Taniel gave Ka poel a look-over. He’d not known she\n‑\ncould make these. They looked like the real article, and Ka poel had bags\n‑\nunder her eyes that indicated many nights spent working. Taniel realized he\nhadn’t seen her much the entire week. He’d been on the wall from sunup to\nsundown, eyes on the Kez.\nBo had the look of concentration he always had when he was using his\nthird eye. “You said not to touch it,” he murmured, looking closer. “Do they\ndo damage beyond, you know, the hole they make in a man’s head?”\n“Yeah,” Taniel said. “One Fatrastan Privileged told me they burn at the\ntouch. I can’t imagine that inside of you.”\n“So it doesn’t need a direct hit,” Bo said thoughtfully. He straightened.\n“Why have I never heard of these before?”\n“If you were the Kez, would you want it widely known that enchanted\nbullets could cut through your best defenses? If you were the Fatrastans,\nwould you want to tip your hand at having an advantage?”\n“Fatrastans could sell one bullet for a lot of money,” Bo said.\nTaniel could practically hear the gears turning in Bo’s head. “Yeah, and\nthen you’d find one coming for you one day.”\nBo smiled. “Probably would at that, wouldn’t I?” He still looked\nthoughtful. “I wouldn’t tell anyone else about those, if I were you.”\nGavril moved up beside them. “Taniel. The Privileged have begun to\nshow themselves. Time to go to work. And you, Bo.” The big man snorted.\n“I want you slinging whatever you can at them the whole way up. The\nbattle’s about to begin.”\nA cannon blast punctuated his words and left Taniel’s ears ringing.\nAnother followed in less than a few heartbeats, and then another.\n“Get used to the sound,” Gavril shouted above the racket. “The only\nthing we’re not short of is ammunition. They’ll pound away day and night,\ntill either we crack the barrels or the Kez send us to the pit.”\nTaniel spent the rest of the morning sending Kez Privileged scrambling\nfor cover. The redstripes cut through the protection offered by the\nPrivileged Tower everywhere but nearest the tower itself. The sorcery was\njust too strong there, and the redstripes pinged off an invisible shield just as\nthe conventional artillery did. Kez Privileged huddled around the tower,\nmatching its ponderous progress. Some even rode on it, sending halfhearted\nshots of sorcery up the mountainside in the form of fire and lightning.

    "text": "once did a shot make it past the redoubts. The wards protecting the\nMountainwatch were too powerful.\nThe Privileged Tower reached a point three-quarters of the way to the\nfortress from Mopenhague around noontime. It rolled to a stop on a\nrelatively flat part of the road near a level area of ground big enough for a\nsquat house and a latrine—a resting point for travelers on the switchbacks.\nBlocks were put behind the wheels and the oxen were corralled. Tents were\nset up in the shadow of the Privileged Tower.\nThe Kez Cabal had found their staging ground.\nThe Kez worked all day beneath the torrent of artillery fire. The air\nabove them shimmered where cannonballs and canister shot rained down\nupon the sorcery-woven shield. Late in the day Taniel found himself near\nBo.\nBo wore his gloves but had yet to make any response to the Kez Cabal.\nHe scowled while he examined the royal cabal’s new position through a\nlooking glass.\n“Pit,” Bo said to himself. He stowed the looking glass, when he sensed\nTaniel’s presence and turned. “She’s down there,” he said.\n“Julene?” Taniel asked. “How can you be sure?”\nBo rubbed his temples. “I’ve had my third eye open all day. She’s\nhiding herself well, and pit, it’s tough to pick out individuals beneath that\nshield. I’ve seen her well of power manifest twice now. Each time when the\nTower got stuck.” He snorted. “Bitch is driving cattle now. I just saw it\nagain, right now. It’s her, all right. Only a Predeii has that flare to them in\nthe Else. She’s barely bothering to hide.”\n“What if there’s another one down there?” Taniel asked.\nBo turned white as a cloud. He swallowed and turned around, staring\nthrough the looking glass again. After a moment he took it away from his\neye. He spit at Taniel’s feet. “You’re a bastard for suggesting that,” he said.\nHe rubbed his eyes. “I’ll be up all night now, looking for a second one.\nDamn it.”\n“So she survived that beating we gave her on the mountain?”\n“It seems so.”\n“How the pit do we kill her, then? Can it even be done?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“You inspire a lot of confidence, you know that?” Taniel ignored Bo’s\nglare. “She’s really trying to come up here to summon Kresimir?”\n“Yes.”\nTaniel had asked the question fifty times now. He hoped Bo’s answer\nwould change. It hadn’t. He felt like he couldn’t give up trying.\n“Why didn’t she do it weeks ago? She could have snuck past us and\ngone up there.”\n“Last time it took thirteen of the most powerful Privileged in the\nworld,” Bo said. “She’ll need an entire royal cabal this time.”\n“Hence, the Kez.”\n“Yes.”\n“Why would they help her?”\n“Who knows what she’s promised them,” Bo said. “Immortality?\nPower? Ruling the Nine at Kresimir’s side?”\n“We have to tell my father.”\n“I sent a warning to him over a month ago,” Bo said. “The answer I got\nwas that he sent you to kill me.”"

    "text": "“We have to tell my father.”\n“I sent a warning to him over a month ago,” Bo said. “The answer I got\nwas that he sent you to kill me.”\n“I believe you,” Taniel said.\n“Very reassuring. Have you written him about Julene?”\n“I did.” He had yet to hear a word from his father. What did that mean?\nLast news from Adopest was a week ago. A Warden had tried to kill\nTamas. They’d not succeeded. Taniel had no idea whether his father had\nbeen wounded or incapacitated—or whether he was simply too busy to\nwrite back. Or maybe he was still planning on sending someone to kill Bo.\nTaniel was looking over his shoulder every day for another powder mage.\nNone had come.\n“I can already tell you he won’t believe all that stuff about summoning\nKresimir,” Taniel said. “He’s too practical.”\n“You did tell him, though, right?”\n“Of course I told him. I told him I couldn’t kill you because I needed\nyour help on the mountain. I told him I saw the Kez army and knew we’d\nneed a Privileged to hold them off.”\n“You didn’t see the Kez army until we were on our way back, though,”\nBo said.\n“But it’s a plausible lie.”\n“The only kind that works.”\n“I requested reinforcements, too,” Taniel said. “At the very least Tamas\nwill send those.”\n“Good. Only problem with a choke point like this is that only so many\nmen can hold it. More soldiers might just muddle things up. I’ll talk to\nGavril. Having a few companies camped just down the mountain on the\nAdran side would allow us to cycle men. Give us more rest.”\nTaniel and Bo stared down at the Kez army for a few minutes of silence.\nBo turned to him. “Tamas is really playing with fire, isn’t he?”\n“Seems so.”\n“I have a question,” Bo said. He sounded hesitant.\nTaniel frowned. When had Bo ever held back from asking him\nanything? “Yeah?”\n“What happened to your mother? I’ve heard the official stories. On a\ndiplomatic mission to Kez. Accused of spying and treachery, and then\nbeheaded quickly. There’s more to it than that.”\nBo wanted to know why Tamas had started the war. “I haven’t told\nyou?”\n“I’ve never asked,” Bo said. “It seemed a topic you were… reluctant to\ndiscuss.”\nTaniel opened his mouth to speak and found he had no words. He\nchoked, then coughed into his hand and tried to blink back the tears. No, he\nhad never talked about it. Not even with his closest friend. He worked to\nfind his voice.\n“My mother’s mother was Kez. Mother used it as an excuse to visit\nonce, sometimes twice a year. Her status as a noblewoman made her\nimpossible for the Kez to touch, despite their habit of imprisoning powder\nmages. Each visit, she tried to find a powder mage and smuggle him or her\ninto Adro and under Tamas’s wing, or out of the Nine entirely. Duke\nNikslaus found out. The Kez arrested her and my grandparents, and they\nwere all put to death by the time word reached Adro.”"

    "text": "Nikslaus found out. The Kez arrested her and my grandparents, and they\nwere all put to death by the time word reached Adro.”\nTaniel cleared his throat. “Tamas demanded that Manhouch declare\nwar. Manhouch refused. The crown buried the entire affair so deep that no\none asked questions. My father disappeared for more than a year. When he\nreturned, there was rumor that he’d tried, and failed, to assassinate Ipille.\nThat rumor was squashed just as quickly as the one that my mother was put\nto death without a trial.”\n“Your father,” Bo said, his voice flat, “tried to kill the king of Kez and\ngot away with it?”\n“He’s never spoken about it. My mother had two brothers. They both\ndisappeared around the same time. I think they were caught, and Tamas got\naway, and claimed he had nothing to do with it.” Taniel sprinkled powder\non the back of his wrist and took a sniff. His uncles were a vague memory.\nHe couldn’t even remember their names.\n“Should I watch my back for another powder mage?” Bo asked.\nTaniel was glad he’d changed the subject. “I don’t think so,” he said.\n“With the whole Grand Army here and the better part of the Kez Cabal,\nTamas knows he needs you. At least until the army retreats.”\n“Fantastic.” Bo managed a smile and slapped Taniel on the shoulder.\nHe turned to head back toward the town. Taniel fingered the rifle in his\nhands and watched his friend’s back. Bo’s shoulders were slumped, his\nwalk hardly more than a shuffle. He was tired, Taniel realized.\nBo was their best weapon against the Kez, and he was getting dull.\nTheir second best weapon? Taniel felt his mouth go dry. That was a lot of\npressure on him. Tamas could thrive on this kind of pressure. He’d throw a\nhundred bullets into the air and kill every Kez Privileged on the\nmountainside. It should be his ass up there.\nTaniel shouldered his rifle and headed back to the bulwark. He had to\ndo it the old-fashioned way. One bullet at a time. No, he realized. He was\nTaniel Two-Shot. He’d take two at once.\nChapter 23\nTamas stepped out of his carriage and took a deep breath of country air.\nOlem already stood in the drive, one hand on the butt of a pistol at his belt,\nthe other tucked into the pocket of his scarlet hunting coat. His nose was in\nthe air like a guard dog as he examined their surroundings. He wore an\noutfit matching Tamas’s with black laceless boots and dark pants in\naddition to the scarlet coat and hunting cap, a rifle over one shoulder.\nThe baying of hounds echoed out across the pastures. The hunting lodge\nrested between two hills beside a stony creek on the edge of the King’s\nWood. It was a vast affair with hundreds of rooms in the traditional bad\ntaste of the Adran monarchy. It had originally been built of local stone and\nimmense oaks the likes of which hadn’t grown in this area for a hundred\nyears. Recent renovations had given it a brick façade.

    "text": "years. Recent renovations had given it a brick façade. The kennels, a two-\nstory building as big as the king’s stables, were visible across the southern\npasture.\n“Come on, Hrusch,” Tamas said. The hound dog leapt from the carriage\nand immediately put his nose to the ground, floppy ears dusting the gravel.\nTamas felt a twinge when Pitlaugh didn’t follow Hrusch out of the carriage\nas he had so many years in the past. A great many things were different\nabout the hunt this year.\nTamas entered the farmhouse and was hit by the nervous titter of\nuncertain conversation. He was among the last to arrive, yet there were\nfewer than a dozen people in the main foyer.\n“Not many here, sir,” Olem said. A butler gave Olem’s cigarette a\ndisapproving look. Olem ignored him.\n“I killed ninety percent of the people who usually come,” Tamas\nmurmured.\nTamas nodded to each of the men and women in the foyer. A couple of\nmerchants of means, and a pair of noblemen with low enough rank to spare\nthem the Elections. Last year they would have worn the pale breeches and\ndark waistcoats of those not included directly in the hunt. This year, they\nwould wear hunt colors along with everyone else simply to fill out the\nnumbers. Brigadiers Ryze and Abrax chatted idly with the merchants. Tamas\nexchanged a few words with them and thanked them for their service against\nthe royalists. Conversations died as he passed by the minor nobility.\nLady Winceslav, dressed in colors with a dark riding habit and a black\ncoat with a scarlet collar, swept down the stairs.\n“Tamas, I’m glad you made it,” she said. Brigadier Barat, a sullen,\nimpetuous young man that Tamas continually wanted to smack, lurked on\nthe stairs behind her.\n“I wouldn’t miss it for the world,” Tamas said. “Hrusch needs\nsomething to take his mind off things.” The hound looked up from his\nolfactory inspection of the floor at the sound of his name. “As do I,\nperhaps,” he added.\n“Or course,” Lady Winceslav said. “Is he in the running, then?”\nTamas scoffed. “He’ll win it. Pitlaugh was the only one to beat him last\nyear. With the king’s kennels out of contention, it’ll be no contest.” He felt\nhis smile begin to slide off his face and gestured for Lady Winceslav to step\nto the side. When they were alone in a hallway, he said, “This is a farce,\nLady.”\nShe glared at him. “It is not, and it’s insulting of you to say so.”\n“The king is dead. This hunt was his tradition. Most of the people who\nused to come are dead too.”\n“So we should let it die with them?” she said. “Don’t deny that you\nenjoy these hunts.”\nTamas took a deep breath. The Orchard Valley Hunt was an annual\ntradition going back six hundred years and marked the beginning of St.\nAdom’s Festival. Tamas struggled within himself. He loved the hunt,\nhowever…\n“It sends the wrong message,” he said. “We want to show the people"

    "text": "Adom’s Festival. Tamas struggled within himself. He loved the hunt,\nhowever…\n“It sends the wrong message,” he said. “We want to show the people\nthat we’re not replacing Manhouch and his nobility with more nobles. The\nhunt is a noble’s sport.”\n“I think not,” Lady Winceslav said. “It’s an Adran sport. Would you\noutlaw tennis, or polo? This is simply entertainment.” She shook her head.\n“Next you’ll want to outlaw masquerades, and then we’ll see how popular\nyou are come winter, when there’s nothing else to do.”\n“I wouldn’t do that. I met my wife at a ball,” Tamas said.\nShe gave him a sympathetic look. “I know. Look around, Tamas. Some\nof the finest merchant families of Adro are here. Even Ricard and Ondraus\ncame. I made the invitation open to everyone in Adopest.”\n“Everyone?” Tamas asked. “If that was the case, there’d be more people\nhere, if only for the free food.”\nLady Winceslav sniffed. “You know what I mean. There are even some\namateur kennelmasters here from North Johal. Freed peasants. They’re\nrough men, but they seem to know their hounds.” She poked Tamas in the\nchest with one slender, slightly wrinkled finger. “Saint Adom’s Festival\ncannot begin without the Orchard Valley Hunt. I simply won’t let it happen.\nNow, the draggers have already begun laying the scent. The hunt will begin\nin twenty minutes. Get Hrusch to the starting line. The stable master will\nhave a hunter ready for you to ride.”\nTamas and Olem found their mounts and headed out to the kennels,\nwhere the official hunt would begin. A chalk line had been dusted on the\ntrimmed grass spanning an entire field. Hundreds of men and women sat\natop their hunters. Some held their hounds on leashes, others by command\nalone, while a number of the wealthier participants had kennelmasters on\nfoot beside them.\nTamas took a place at one end of the line. There were more people out\nhere than he expected, and a far greater number of hounds. “She really\nmeant it when she said she had invited everyone. Half these people aren’t\neven wearing hunt colors.” He bit back a comment. It was a damned time to\ncomplain. It would still be fine colors and nobility if it weren’t for him.\n“Aye,” Olem said. “I’m glad there’s anyone here at all. Would be a sad\nstart to the festival without a hunt.”\n“Did Lady Winceslav pay you to say that?” Tamas said. Olem was a\nsoldier, risen from the peasantry to his current position. He had no\nattachment to the hunt.\nOlem looked surprised. “No, sir.” He flicked the end of his cigarette\ninto the grass and immediately began rolling another.\n“I’m joking, Olem.” Tamas glanced about, grimacing at the sight of a\npeasant on a mangy-looking mare with two hounds and an off-red coat that\ndidn’t come close to hunt colors.\nIn a few minutes’ time the horn was blown and the hounds were off.\nTamas began at a slow canter, watching Hrusch fly off ahead of the rest of"

    "text": "didn’t come close to hunt colors.\nIn a few minutes’ time the horn was blown and the hounds were off.\nTamas began at a slow canter, watching Hrusch fly off ahead of the rest of\nthe animals in the direction of the scent. It wasn’t long before the dogs\ndisappeared into the woods. Tamas urged himself ahead of the rest of the\nriders until he reached the woods, then slacked off and let himself be\npassed. He closed his eyes, listening to the softening bays of the hounds, the\nsound soothing to his ears.\nHe opened his eyes after some time to find himself alone with Olem.\nThe bodyguard’s hunter trotted along beside Tamas’s. Olem’s eyes scanned\nthe surrounding brush with the vigil of a hawk.\n“Do you ever relax?” Tamas asked.\n“Not since the Warden, sir.”\nTamas could see horses up ahead, and hear others behind them. The\nhuntsmen had begun to spread out in order to enjoy themselves while the\nhounds ran themselves to exhaustion. The sport would last all day, either\nuntil one of the hounds caught up with the volunteer dragging the scent or\nuntil they reached the end point of the race. Last year, Pitlaugh had found\nthe volunteer halfway through the day, earning the ire of Adro’s nobility for\ncutting short their hunt, and earning himself a flank of steer from Tamas.\nTamas brushed off memories of past hunts and turned to Olem. “It\nwasn’t your fault. They’ll send more Wardens at me. You’ll do little against\none of them.”\nOlem rested one hand lightly on his pistol. “Don’t write me off so\nquickly, sir. I can cause more damage than you’d guess.”\n“Of course,” Tamas said gently. He felt more relaxed than he had in,\nwell, it seemed like years. He let his mind wander, enjoying the cool breeze\nthrough the trees and the periodic splash of warm sun on his face. It was a\nperfect, blue-sky day for the Orchard Valley Hunt.\n“A question, sir.” Olem’s voice cut through his thoughts.\n“If it has to do with the Kez, I don’t want to hear it.”\n“I was wondering what you’ll do with Mihali, sir?”\nTamas stirred himself out of his reverie and gave Olem’s back an\nannoyed glance as the soldier searched the woods with his eyes. “I think\nI’m sending him back to Hassenbur,” Tamas said.\nOlem gave Tamas a sharp look.\nTamas said, “Not you, too? I’d expect the common soldiers to grow\nattached, but not you.”\n“I am a common soldier, sir. But you stated his worth yourself,” Olem\nsaid. “Creating food from thin air.”\n“I risk angering Claremonte. The asylum’s patron is not a man to be\ntrifled with, not with his position with the Brudania-Gurla Trading\nCompany. I risk our entire supply of saltpeter. At this point in the war,\ngunpowder is more important than food.”\n“And later?” Olem asked.\n“Mihali is a madman, Olem. He belongs in an asylum.” He chose his\nwords carefully. “It would be a cruelty to let him live like a normal man.”"

He belongs in an asylum.” He chose his\nwords carefully. “It would be a cruelty to let him live like a normal man.”\nHe knew the words made sense in his head, but when he spoke them out\nloud, they seemed wrong. He frowned. “They can help him at the asylum.\n“Have you checked on those names that Adamat gave us?” Tamas said,\nunwilling to continue the conversation.\nOlem was clearly uncomfortable with the abrupt end to the topic of\nMihali’s future. “Yes, sir,” he said stiffly. “Our people are looking into it.\nSlowly. We don’t have enough men, to be honest, but Adamat’s hunches\nare proving accurate enough.”\n“He said he gathered that list of names and ships in just two days of\ninvestigation,” Tamas said. “The entire police force on the docks has only\ngiven us half a dozen Kez smugglers since the war started. How can he\nwork so fast?”\nOlem shrugged. “He’s got a gift. Also, he doesn’t have the restrictions\nof the police. He’s not wearing a uniform. He can’t be bribed or\nintimidated.”\n“You think he can find my traitor?” Tamas asked.\n“Perhaps.” Olem didn’t look so sure. “I wish you’d put more men on it.\nYou shouldn’t leave the fate of Adro in the hands of one retired\ninvestigator.”\nTamas shook his head. “As you said, he can go where the police cannot.\nI can’t trust it to anyone else. Everyone I truly trust—you, Sabon, the rest of\nthe powder cabal—they’re doing tasks of utmost importance, and none of\nthem has the set of talents and skills that Adamat does. If he can’t track\ndown my traitor, no one else can.”\nOlem gave him a dark stare. The corner of his mouth twitched, and\nTamas felt a thrill of fear through his chest. “Give me a writ of purpose,”\nOlem said quietly. “And fifty men. I’ll find out who the traitor is.”\nTamas rolled his eyes. “I’m not going to let you hack apart my council\nwith a meat cleaver and a hot iron. You’ll leave nothing left of them, and\nI’ll have made enemies of the most powerful people in Adro. I’m sorry,\nOlem, but I need you watching my back and I need the other five of the\ncouncil—the ones that aren’t traitors—fully intact.”\nTamas turned as he heard horses galloping up from behind. “Pit, I was\nhoping for a pleasant day.”\n“Ho there, Field Marshal,” Charlemund said. The arch-diocel looked\nnothing like a man of the Rope. He wore his hunt colors proudly on a\nhunter easily ten stone bigger than Tamas’s. He was followed by three\nyoung women; probably priestesses, though it was impossible to tell with\nthem wearing hunt colors. Just behind the women was Ondraus the Reeve.\nThe old man wore a black hunt coat and pale breeches to indicate that he\nwasn’t part of the hunt proper, yet he rode his hunter with far more poise\nand confidence than Tamas would have expected from a glorified\naccountant."

Not one of them looked above\ntwenty years old, even though they bore the rank of priestess. They were far\ntoo young. And pretty. Women that attractive did not enter into service to\nthe Church.\nThe reeve rode up next to Tamas.\n“Ondraus,” Tamas said. “You’re the last person I’d expect to see at a\nhunt.”\nOndraus turned in his saddle and pointed behind them. “No, that’s the\nlast person you’d expect to see at a hunt.”\nA horse struggled through a patch of briars not far off, urged on with an\nincessant stream of curses by Ricard Tumblar. The union boss caught his\ncheek on a thorn and let out a yell, kicking the horse. Hunter and rider\nsurged from the patch, galloping to catch up with the rest. Tamas reached\nout and grabbed the bridle as the horse came by. He leaned over, placing a\nhand between its eyes. “Shh. Quiet,” he said, soothing the animal. “Lord\nabove, Ricard, stop urging it on. You’ll get yourself thrown.”\nRicard’s heels had been dug into the creature’s side. He let up\nimmediately and gave a great sigh. “Son of a bitch,” he said. “I was made to\nride in a carriage, not on a horse.”\nCharlemund grinned at him. “I can see that,” he said. “We all can. I’ve\nseen children who ride better than you.”\n“And I’ve seen pimps with fewer whores,” Ricard snapped.\nThe three priestesses gasped. The arch-diocel spun his mount to face\nRicard, laying a hand on the grip of his sword. “Take it back or I’ll have\nyour hide.”\nRicard drew a pistol from his belt. “I’ll blow your face off if you come a\nstep closer.”\nTamas groaned. He grabbed Ricard’s pistol by the barrel and shoved it\naway. “Put them away, both of you,” he said. He urged his mount up beside\nRicard’s. “Where do you get off threatening an arch-diocel?” he growled.\n“Are you mad?”\nRicard wiped the blood from his cheek, a scratch from the briars. He\nlooked at his fingers. “Bloody hunt.”\n“Why are you here?” Tamas said.\n“Lady Winceslav insisted,” Ricard said. “She said I was gentry now,\nbeing a member of the council, and that it was expected of me. I’ve had\nmore fun in the bottom of a fishing boat.”\n“You’ve never ridden before?” Olem asked."

I’ve had\nmore fun in the bottom of a fishing boat.”\n“You’ve never ridden before?” Olem asked.\nRicard returned his pistol to his belt and took the reins in both hands.\n“Not once. When I was a boy, my father had no money for lessons, and by\nthe time I thought of it, I was rich enough to afford to take a carriage. Now,\nwhere the pit is that whipper in? Lady Winceslav said that fool would stay\n‑\nwith me and keep me from making an ass of myself.”\n“He was unsuccessful,” Charlemund said.\nRicard glared. Tamas elbowed him hard in the ribs. Ricard turned to the\nthree priestesses. “My apologies, ladies. My comments weren’t directed at\nyou.” One and all, the three turned their noses up at him. Ricard sighed.\n“I came here for a pleasant afternoon,” Tamas said, glancing around at\nthe group. “Now, can I have that, or do I need to ride on my own?”\nRicard and Charlemund grumbled to themselves. Tamas resumed\nriding, leading Ricard’s horse. “Let him do the steering,” he said after a\nmoment, letting go of the bridle. “He knows the trail, he knows the other\nhorses. He’ll follow on his own. He knows you don’t know what you’re\ndoing. You try to take control and he’ll fight you the whole way.”\nRicard gave a silent nod and avoided looking at Charlemund and his\npriestesses.\nThey were soon joined by the whipper in.\n‑\nTamas was surprised to find he knew the man. “Gaben!” he called.\n“Sir.” Gaben rode up beside him, all smiles. He was a spry young man\nwho looked well at ease on a horse. Whippers in usually kept the dogs on\n‑\nthe trail, but this one was obviously meant to keep the people on the trail.\n“Olem, this is Gaben,” Tamas said. “Captain Ajucare’s youngest son.”\n“Pleased to meet you,” Olem said. “I’ve known the captain for many\nyears.”\nGaben extended a hand. “You’re the Knacked that doesn’t sleep?”\n“Right.”\n“It’s a pleasure.”\n“So the Lady attached you to Ricard, here, did she?” Tamas said.\nGaben nodded. “Said he might need some help.”\n“You lost him for a while, it seems.”\n“He went through a bramblebush, sir. I decided to go around.”\n“Smart man. I’ve heard from your father you have a singular skill for\nhorses.”\n“He overtells it,” Gaben said modestly.\n“No, I’m sure he does not.” Tamas saw him eyeing the young ladies.\n“Please, don’t let me keep you.”\nGaben rode up beside the priestesses and answered their questions about\nthe hunt. Soon after, Brigadier Sabastenien came up quietly from behind.\nHe joined the whipper in and the priestesses, listening quietly to their talk.\n‑\nTamas leaned over to Olem. “Brigadier Sabastenien impressed me\nduring the racket with the royalists.

Mark my words, he’ll be senior brigadier by the time he’s forty.”\nSilence fell in the wood, the only sound that of horses and the quiet\nconversation of the young people a few dozen yards ahead of them. Tamas\nwas just beginning to enjoy the relative quiet when Ondraus spoke up.\n“I want to know about this cook,” the reeve said.\nTamas turned in the saddle toward Ondraus. The path here was wide\nenough for the four of them to ride abreast. Tamas was on one end, with\nRicard on his right, lagging slightly behind, and Ondraus between Ricard\nand Charlemund. Olem stayed just behind them, his eyes on the forest.\n“What cook?” Tamas said.\n“The one who is providing for all the clerks and workers in the House\nof Nobles, in addition to your garrison,” Ondraus said. The bent old\naccountant looked alert in the afternoon sun and rode his horse like a man\nmuch younger. His gaze matched Tamas’s.\n“The one who creates dishes that have never been seen in Adopest and\nreceives shipments of raw goods that are well out of season in this part of\nthe world, without ever having made an order in the first place. The one\nfeeding five thousand people on a few hundred kranas’ worth of flour and\nbeef a day.” Ondraus gave Tamas a shallow smile. “The one that claims\nhe’s a god. Or had this all gone beneath your notice?”\nTamas slowed his mount slightly and waited for the others to do the\nsame. The priestesses, brigadier, and whipper in went on ahead, unaware.\n‑\nWhen they were well out of earshot, Tamas said, “He’s a Knacked. Not a\ngod.”\nCharlemund snorted. “I’m certainly glad. It’s blasphemy.”\n“So you know of him?” Tamas said, resigned. He’d hoped that\nCharlemund’s gaze had swept over Mihali without noticing. A vain hope\nindeed.\n“Of course,” Charlemund said. “My colleagues in the Church have been\napprised of the situation. I received their communiqués just this morning.”\n“And?”\n“They wish me to take him into Church custody immediately. Before\nany more of his lies can be spread.”\n“He’s harmless,” Tamas said. “He escaped from Hassenbur Asylum.\nI’m sending him back any day now.” The Church’s involvement was the\nlast thing he needed.\n“Who is he?” Ondraus asked.\n“Lord of the Golden Chefs,” Tamas said.\n“Don’t mock me,” Ondraus said, taken aback.\n“He’s not,” Ricard suddenly said. “Lord of the Golden Chefs is a title\namong culinary experts. It means he’s the best damned cook in all the Nine.\nI can’t believe he’s really in the city.”\n“You know him?” Tamas asked.\n“Know of him, more like,” Ricard said. “I paid a king’s ransom to have\nhim cook for Manhouch five years ago.

    "text": "“You know him?” Tamas asked.\n“Know of him, more like,” Ricard said. “I paid a king’s ransom to have\nhim cook for Manhouch five years ago. It was that dinner that convinced\nthe king to let me start a union. I’ve never tasted such food.” He gave a low\nwhistle. “His squash soup is to die for. I’d love to see him.”\nTamas stifled a smile at the very thought of Mihali’s squash soup. His\nmouth watered a little, and for just a moment he could smell it, as if Mihali\nwas making it in a pot in the middle of the next clearing.\n“Well,” Charlemund said, “you won’t meet him. I’m bringing him\nunder Church custody tonight. I only held off giving the order this morning\nin deference to Tamas.”\n“And if I don’t let him go?” Tamas said lightly.\nCharlemund gave a laugh, as if Tamas had made some kind of joke.\n“That isn’t an option. The man is a heathen and a blasphemer. We all know\nthere is only one God, Kresimir.”\n“Aren’t Adom, Unice, Rosvel, and the rest all supposed to be\nKresimir’s brothers and sisters?” Tamas asked. “I’m not up on my church\nlore as much as I should be…”\n“Doctrine, not lore,” Charlemund said. “Semantics. They helped him\ncreate the Nine, yes, that is why they are saints. Kresimir is the only God\namong them. To claim otherwise goes against Church doctrine. It was\ndecided so at the Council of Kezlea in five oh seven.”\n‑ ‑\nRicard’s eyes grew wide. “You do know something about the Church.\nIncredible! I thought all you needed to be an arch-diocel was a nice hat and\na harem.”\nCharlemund ignored Ricard as one might ignore an irritating rug seller\nin the market. “The Council also established that heretics and blasphemers\nwould fall under the jurisdiction of the Church. Every king of the Nine\nsigned the accord.”\n“Interesting,” Tamas said, “that Adro has no king anymore.”\nCharlemund looked startled by this. “What…?”\n“Has it occurred to any of the arch-diocels,” Tamas said, “that Adro is\nno longer held by any of the agreements signed by previous kings?\nTechnically, we don’t even have to pay tithe anymore.”\nCharlemund sputtered. “I don’t think that’s true. I mean, we had an\nagreement…”\n“With Manhouch,” Ondraus said. The reeve had a nasty smile on his\nface, and Tamas wondered if he had just given Ondraus an excuse to do\nsomething that would completely alienate the Church. Tamas squeezed his\neyes shut. O Kresimir above. I shouldn’t have said anything.\n“I think I’d like to catch up with the rest of the hunt now,” Tamas said\nbefore Charlemund could respond. “I can barely hear the hounds.” He urged\nhis hunter on, reaching the whipper in in a few moments.\n‑\nGaben turned. “Sir,” he said, “We’ve fallen significantly behind the rest\nof the group.”\n“Yes,” Tamas said, “I gathered.”"

    "text": "‑\nGaben turned. “Sir,” he said, “We’ve fallen significantly behind the rest\nof the group.”\n“Yes,” Tamas said, “I gathered.”\n“If you’d permit, sir,” Gaben said, “I’d like to lead us on a shortcut\nthrough the forest. I know where they’re planning on being in, oh”—he\nglanced up at the sun, which was showing through the trees—“two hours. I\nthink we can catch them there. Otherwise we might not reach them until\nafter the hunt has finished.”\n“Sir,” Olem said in a low voice, “it’s dangerous to leave the hunt trail.\nThese forests were the king’s own, bigger than Adopest and all the suburbs.\nI used to play in them as a boy. We get lost here and we could be gone for\ndays.”\n“The going will be slow,” the whipper in said, “through the brush, but\n‑\nwe should have no problem cutting them off. I know these woods well.”\n“I don’t like it, sir,” Olem said.\nTamas pushed away his own uneasiness and gave Olem a smile. “Calm\nyourself. I’ve known Gaben since he was a boy. The worst things in these\nwoods are deer. Lead on.”\nThey trotted along the deer trail, single file, making their way through the\nwoods. The priestesses bantered loudly behind Tamas. He let his mind\nwander, considering battle plans and strategies. Battle had yet to be joined\nat the Gates of Wasal. Only at South Pike had shots been fired, and the\nunique positioning of the fortress town required very little strategy. They’d\nbeen shrugging off Kez advances for a month, with minimal loss and\ndespite powerful sorceries on the Kez side. The very thought of Julene’s\nbetrayal made Tamas’s blood boil.\nAnd Taniel. What could he do? Bo was still alive and the two were\nworking together to push back the Kez. That pleased Tamas. Yet Bo was\nstill under the gaes. Could Tamas trust them? Taniel had disobeyed his\norders. There would have to be redress for that, though Taniel claimed he\nhad a good reason to keep Bo alive—they needed the Privileged to help\nhold Shouldercrown.\nTamas knew the real reason. Taniel hadn’t been able to do it. He’d not\nbeen able to kill his best friend, even when it was necessary; even on the\norder of his superior. Taniel had to know that Tamas would see through the\nexcuses. Tamas pushed the thought aside, unwilling to let it ruin his day.\nThe terrain slowly changed as they rode. They descended into a valley\nwhere moss-covered boulders hemmed them in and the forest floor was\nthick with fallen branches and rotted pine needles. The place seemed to\ndeaden all sound. An icy hand climbed Tamas’s spine. The forest felt old\nand deep, and the clop of their horses’ hooves an intrusion here.\nTheir deer trail ran out, and they followed a small brook. The boulders\ngrew bigger, the tree canopy overhead thicker. It seemed they had not even\nreached the bottom of the valley.

    "text": "reached the bottom of the valley. Tamas had no memory of this place from\nother hunts.\nTamas found himself staring at the back of Ondraus’s head. Wisps of\nsilver hair clung to his skull, along with a pair of moles as big as a two-\nkrana coin. Was he the traitor? Tamas became acutely aware that he rode\nwith four of his council, any one of whom was just as likely the traitor as\nany of the others.\nOlem suddenly spurred his horse forward. He passed the other riders\nand reined in before the whipper in. “Where are we?” he said.\n‑\n“Almost there,” Gaben said. “Not a mile from rejoining the hunt.”\n“Then why can’t we hear hounds?” Olem said.\nTamas rode up to the front of the column, followed closely by\nCharlemund and Ondraus. Ricard remained at the back of the column,\nstaring up at the boulders around them.\n“It’s impossible to hear anything in these rocks,” Gaben said as Tamas\nreined in beside him.\n“We’re not anywhere near the hunt,” Olem said. “This is the Giant’s\nBilliard Table. I ran here as a boy.”\nTamas scowled at Gaben. “Explain yourself.”\nA rock fell from one of the boulders above. Tamas jerked around, eyes\nsearching the forest. “Ricard?” he said. Ricard’s horse was alone at the back\nof the column, the reins thrown over a broken tree limb. Ricard was\nmissing. Tamas turned back to Gaben. “Explain yourself. Now!”\nTamas heard leaves rustling in the forest around them. He turned again,\nsearching. He saw nothing. Ricard had been carrying a pistol. Tamas\nreached out with his senses. Ricard was nearby. Tamas could sense the\npowder. He’d scrambled up onto one of the boulders and lay flat on it,\nfacing the group. Was Ricard the traitor? Was this some kind of trap?\nRicard was carrying a pistol. Surely he knew that Tamas could find him just\nfrom the gunpowder.\nA man stepped out on a boulder just ahead of their trail. He held a bow,\nstrung, with arrow at the ready, aimed at Tamas. He sighted along one eye,\nbecause the other eye was covered by a white patch of cloth. The man was\nolder than Tamas, his face weathered by battles. He wore a brown-and-\ngreen patched cloak to blend in with the forest.\n“Brigadier Ryze,” Tamas said.\nOlem tossed Tamas a pistol and brought about his rifle, moving with the\nspeed of a seasoned soldier. Tamas caught the pistol and leveled it at the\nbrigadier, not bothering to cock it. A powder mage didn’t need to.\n“Lower the weapon,” Brigadier Ryze said. His aim with the bow didn’t\nwaver. He took a half step forward, his footing sure on the boulder. His\ncloak rippled, revealing the scarlet colors of the hunt underneath.\n“I’ll kill you right now,” Tamas warned.\n“Maybe,” Ryze said, “But not all of us.”\nTamas kept his eyes locked on Ryze. “Olem?” he said."

Fifteen. But there may be more in the woods.”\n“There are,” Brigadier Ryze said.\n“Do you know who I am?” Charlemund demanded. Tamas didn’t have\nto look to know Charlemund had drawn his smallsword. Little good it\nwould do against yeomen far above them.\n“We know, Arch-Diocel,” Brigadier Ryze said. “And you won’t be\nharmed as long as Field Marshal Tamas comes with us. None of you will be\nharmed.”\n“I will destroy you,” Charlemund snarled.\n“I’m sure you will,” Brigadier Ryze said without emotion. “Field\nMarshal, if you please?”\nTamas took a mental inventory of his weapons. A dozen bullets. Not\nnearly enough to kill fifteen men by scattering the shot, even at his best. He\nconsidered Ricard up on one of the boulders and wondered if he was up\nthere because he had sensed a trap or because he’d set the trap in the first\nplace.\n“I don’t seem to have a choice,” Tamas said.\n“That’s right,” Ryze said. His lone eye traveled around the group\nslowly. “Let’s go.”\nTamas reached out again with his senses. None of the men had a\ngranule of gunpowder on them. They’d been very careful. He pushed his\nsenses farther into the woods, trying to find out if there were any more\narmed with powder. He froze. There was a Privileged in the forest.\n“Why did you sell out to Manhouch?” Tamas said. “Lady Winceslav\ntrusted you.”\nRyze gave a slight shake of his head. “This has nothing to do with the\nKez. I serve Adro and Lady Winceslav.”\n“Then why is there a Privileged in the woods over there?” Tamas asked,\npointing north.\nBrigadier Ryze’s eye widened slightly. “This has nothing to do with the\nKez,” he said again. “Now, come with us, or we’ll take you all down and\nsort it out later.” Ryze’s fingers twitched on the bow. It was said Ryze was\na perfect shot with bow, crossbow, rifle, or pistol. He had a reputation for\naction and brutality—when necessary. He wasn’t stupid, either. There was a\nreason he’d risen to be a brigadier of the Wings of Adom.\nTamas urged his hunter forward.\n“Dismounted,” Ryze said, gesturing to the ground with the tip of his\narrow. “Hand your extra powder charges to your bodyguard. Same with the\npistol. Leave the horse tied up to a tree.”\nTamas did as he was told and approached Brigadier Ryze.\n“You bastard,” Olem said. “You filthy bastard. I’ll take out that other\neye.”\n“Quiet your dog,” Ryze said.\n“Olem, it’s all right,” Tamas said. He paused next to Gaben and glanced"

The man was expressionless. “I take it this is one of yours,” Tamas said\nto Ryze.\n“He is,” Ryze said. “He’ll guide the rest back to the hunt.”\n“Go to the pit,” Tamas said. “Olem, take everyone back safely. You\nsaid you played here as a boy. Can you get out?”\n“Yes,” Olem said. He sounded miserable.\n“That’s an order, then,” Tamas said. “Don’t come back for me until\neveryone is out of the forest.”\n“If you follow us,” Ryze said, “I’ll cut his throat.” The brigadier leapt\nfrom the boulder, landing on the ground with a hollow-sounding thump.\nHe edged Tamas into step before him. They were soon flanked by a pair\nof woodsmen, then two more. Tamas saw that they weren’t wearing hunt\ncolors under their cloaks. They’d probably been in place for hours.\n“Ryze,” someone called suddenly. Tamas turned with the brigadier. It\nwas Brigadier Sabastenien, the quiet commander. His voice was calm,\ncollected. “We’ll have your head for this betrayal,” he said. “The Lady will\nnot stand for it.”\n“I know,” Brigadier Ryze responded. There was a hint of sadness to his\nvoice. He turned his back on Sabastenien and led Tamas into the woods. As\nsoon as they were out of sight of the other group, Brigadier Ryze broke into\na trot, urging Tamas forward with the tip of a dagger. He did it absently,\nthough, as if almost forgetting that Tamas was his prisoner. Tamas glanced\nover his shoulder, gauging the brigadier.\n“Why are you doing this?” Tamas said.\n“Quiet,” Ryze said, his voice not unkind. “You don’t even know what\n‘this’ is. You say there’s a Privileged in the forest?”\nTamas stopped suddenly. He spun on Brigadier Ryze, grabbing the\nwrist with the dagger. Ryze gripped tightly, one hand going to Tamas’s\nshoulder. They struggled silently for a moment, neither man the stronger,\nuntil one of Ryze’s men stepped up and struck Tamas in the small of the\nback. Tamas grunted, letting go of Ryze’s wrist. He dropped to his knees.\n“Back off,” Ryze snarled at his man. He grasped Tamas by the forearm\nand helped him up. “I’ve been betrayed,” he said quietly, only for Tamas to\nhear.\n“So have I.” Tamas glared at the brigadier. There was a time Tamas\nconsidered Ryze a colleague, though never close enough to be a friend.\nDecades ago, postings had seen them together overseas.\n“Not the way you think.” Ryze stepped back and lowered his dagger.\n“I’m not here to kill you, Field Marshal, nor to hand you over to the Kez.”\n“Then what is this charade?” Tamas wondered if he should go for Ryze\nagain. He might get the upper hand, but Ryze’s men watched from nearby."

    "text": "“Then what is this charade?” Tamas wondered if he should go for Ryze\nagain. He might get the upper hand, but Ryze’s men watched from nearby.\n“To warn you,” Ryze said. “I’ve brought my most trusted men, but\napparently that was not enough. You’re sure there’s a Privileged in the\nforest?”\n“Yes,” Tamas said slowly. He opened his third eye. “He’s getting\ncloser. He has Wardens with him.” The thought chilled him. Brigadier Ryze\nseemed in earnest, but Tamas was not ready to trust him. He might only be\ndelaying, waiting for the Privileged to catch up.\nRyze swore. “Kah! Loadio! Take positions there and there.” He pointed\nupward to a pair of boulders. The two men nodded and climbed onto the\nrocks. “Kill the sorcerer,” he said. Ryze turned to Tamas. “Run!”\nTamas wondered whether he should break away, take the opportunity to\nescape. He hesitated for just a moment before following Ryze into the\nforest. As they went, Ryze called out the names of his men, pairing them up\nand placing them between himself and the sorcerer. Tamas glanced over his\nshoulder now and then, watching for the pastel glow of a Privileged in his\nthird sight. The Privileged was coming on quickly, along with dimmer\nglows of power. Privileged didn’t move that fast unless they were being\ncarried by a Warden.\nRyze turned to bark an order to one of his men and stopped. Tamas\nnearly ran into him. Ryze drew a dagger and fell into a fighting stance.\nTamas turned. Only two of Ryze’s men were left nearby. One of them\nwas a yeoman, bow slung over his arm. He toppled onto a bed of dead\nleaves, a crimson slash across his throat. The other man was Gaben. He\nwiped the dagger calmly on the yeoman’s cloak and faced Ryze.\n“Your father…” Ryze said.\n“Is a damned fool who should never have followed this traitor,” Gaben\nsaid, gesturing at Tamas. He readied himself, squaring with his own dagger\nagainst Ryze. “All I have to do is keep you occupied until the duke arrives.”\nThe old brigadier threw himself forward, dagger in hand. He parried,\nslashed, then leapt upon Gaben, driving his dagger into the man’s chest. It\nhadn’t even been a contest. Ryze stood up, his lone eye red with anger, and\nlooked back the way they’d come. Tamas heard the report of sorcery in the\nforest, and the crash of a falling tree.\n“I’ve left my men to their deaths,” Ryze said. He squeezed his eye shut,\ndropping his dagger. Tamas noticed that there was blood on his yeoman’s\ncloak. Ryze touched the wound. “Lucky jab,” he said, gesturing at the dead\nwhipper in.\n‑\nTamas helped Ryze to a clear spot on the forest floor, leaning him up\nagainst a log. “Tell me what you have to say,” he said, “before all this is for\nnothing.” The sound of sorcery was getting closer."

Brigadier Barat\nhas betrayed us. He holds my youngest son captive. I’d hoped to convince\nyou to leave the hunt and help me rescue him. We’d have had hours of a\nhead start before he knew we were gone.” Ryze passed a hand over his face.\nSweat rolled down his cheeks, mingled with tears. “I didn’t know we’d\nbeen betrayed.”\n“Is he the traitor?” Tamas said. “Does Lady Winceslav know?”\n“He’s not the only traitor,” Ryze said. “He’s working with someone\ninside your council. And no. The Lady has no idea. She’s blinded by love.\nBarat has seduced her. I’ve done my best to get him sent to the lines or out\nof the country, but she won’t hear of it. He is the only one with her ear right\nnow.”\n“Do you know who he’s working with?”\n“No,” Ryze said. “Run!” Ryze lurched forward, shoving Tamas to the\nground. The forest erupted in flames suddenly, heat searing Tamas’s face\nand hands. He hit the ground and rolled, pushing himself up to his feet and\nspinning toward Ryze. The old brigadier screamed as his skin peeled from\nhis body and his flesh withered. Tamas dove behind a boulder, eyes wild for\nany sign of the Privileged and his Wardens. He heard a crack, and the last\nthing he remembered was the boulder exploding.\nChapter 24\n“What do you want?”\nLord Vetas stood on the front step of Adamat’s house. He was dressed\nsharply in a new black tailcoat with matching boots shiny enough to hurt\nAdamat’s eyes. He wore a scarlet vest beneath, and a black silk shirt. He\nheld his hat in his hand, short black hair styled and flattened against his\nhead. Adamat wiped the sleep from his eyes and adjusted his dressing\ngown. He glanced at the hall clock.\n“It’s seven o’clock,” Adamat said flatly.\n“May I come in?” Lord Vetas asked. His tone was polite.\n“No. Why are you here?” He paused, suddenly suspicious. “And where\nare your goons?”\n“I’ve no need to make threats today,” Lord Vetas said. “Last time, my\nmen were only there to take care of Palagyi. I trust you had no problem\ndisposing of the body?”\nFor all the concern he showed, he might have been asking about\nAdamat’s morning tea.\n“Not too much, thank you,” Adamat said. “Now, tell me why you’re\nhere.”\nLord Vetas seemed unruffled by Adamat’s brusque tone. “A gift,” he\nsaid. He held up a small black box. “I’ve not yet heard from you. I assume\nyou have decided not to take our offer of employment?”\nAdamat snatched the box. “Tell your master to stuff it.

It was no good to\nme. And you,” he added. “You don’t exist. I haven’t had much time to hunt\nyou down, but there is no ‘Lord’ Vetas.”\n“Very astute,” Lord Vetas said. “But the address is quite valid. I’m\nsurprised my men took no note of your visit. Impressed, in fact.” He raised\nhis hands and clapped them together softly. “Your skills as an investigator\nare impressive. I have no doubt you will discover my identity eventually,\nand that of my master.”\n“Why don’t you tell me who you are and save us both the time,”\nAdamat said.\nLord Vetas just smiled. “You’re conducting an investigation for Field\nMarshal Tamas into the likely traitor within his council.”\n“No.”\n“Don’t lie to me, Adamat,” Lord Vetas said. “I already know as much.”\n“Even if I were, I’d not discuss a current investigation,” Adamat said.\nLord Vetas said, “What are your conclusions so far?”\n“Don’t you understand me?” Adamat asked. “I have nothing to discuss\nwith you. Good day.” He made to close his door.\nLord Vetas held up his hand politely, like a clerk trying to get a\nsuperior’s attention.\n“What?” Adamat said.\n“Won’t you open your gift?”\nAdamat frowned at the box in his hand. It was plain and black, tied with\na silk ribbon in the middle like one might find at a jeweler’s. He undid the\nribbon. Within was a finger. It had been severed at the knuckle, and\nexperience with this sort of thing told Adamat it had come from a teenage\nboy. There was a ring on the finger. The ring had belonged to Adamat’s\nfather. A ring Adamat had given to…\nAdamat trembled as he put the lid back on the box and slipped it into his\nrobe pocket. He snatched Lord Vetas by the front of his suit and yanked\nhim through the door. Lord Vetas made no protest as Adamat kicked the\ndoor shut and slammed him against the wall. His breathing was steady as\nAdamat put his face close.\n“It belonged to your son,” Lord Vetas said helpfully.\n“I know who it belonged to!” Adamat couldn’t help but shout. He took\nhold of Lord Vetas’s suit coat with both hands and threw the man down the\nhall. He drew his cane sword from the cane holder by the door and bared\nthe blade. He thrust it under Lord Vetas’s chin. Lord Vetas didn’t even\ntremble.\n“If he’s dead…”\nLord Vetas looked at the point of the sword like a man examining a\nharmless peculiarity beneath his nose. “Oh, he’s quite alive. That’s the\nthing with using people as leverage. They aren’t leverage if they’re dead.”\n“I will kill you.”\n“Kill me, and my master will simply send another.

Lord Vetas\nproduced a hanky and dabbed the blood away.\n“Why shouldn’t I kill you now?” Adamat whispered.\n“I just told you.” Lord Vetas gave a sympathetic smile. “You’re very\nemotional right now. I understand. Take a moment to calm down and think\nthings over.”\nAdamat wanted nothing more than to run the man through. He strained\nto keep himself in check. A slight twitch and the man’s life blood would be\non the hallway rug.\nSouSmith had appeared at the top of the stairs in his nightclothes.\nAdamat waved him away.\n“What does your master want to know?”\n“Everything,” Lord Vetas said. “Whatever Tamas has told you;\nwhatever you discover through your investigation. Starting now.”\nAdamat sighed, the fight draining out of him. Fear filled the empty\nspace. “Nothing. I know nothing.”\nA hint of annoyance betrayed itself on Lord Vetas’s face.\n“My investigation has yet to draw any conclusions.” Adamat struggled\nto gather his scattered thoughts. Josep was still alive, he kept reminding\nhimself. Everything would be fine. As long as he played along with Lord\nVetas.\n“Let’s start at the beginning,” Lord Vetas said. “Tell me all about your\ninvestigations. Both of them.”\nAdamat found himself talking. The words tumbled over themselves, as\nif each one was the brick in a wall of safety he was building around his\nfamily. He slumped at some point, returning his cane sword to the cane and\nleaning upon it heavily.\nHe told Lord Vetas everything he knew about Kresimir’s Promise and\nhis and Tamas’s conclusion about the Promise being nothing but rubbish.\nHe told him about the night at the Skyline Palace, and about his meeting\nwith Uskan. He included details he’d not meant to say. He went on,\nrecounting his meetings with Ricard Tumblar and Lady Winceslav.\nThrough it all Lord Vetas remained quiet. Adamat could read nothing on\nthe man’s face; he absorbed the information impassively.\nAdamat spoke so quickly that it did not even occur to him to fudge the\ntruth or lie outright until afterward. When he finished, he fell to sit on the\nstairs, his hands shaking, and he felt drained. It seemed his age had caught\nup to him then, and far surpassed him.\nLord Vetas took a moment to think. “Two months of investigation, and\nthis is all you have?”\nAdamat narrowed his eyes. “I’ve been doing the work of twenty men.”\n“And these are all the details, you’re sure?”\n“I’m sure,” Adamat said. “I do not forget things.”\n“Ah, yes. Your Knack. Tell me more about this… pending destruction\nof Adro,” Lord Vetas said.\n“I know very little.” Adamat was tired. He wanted nothing more than to\ncrawl back into a hole. “It is a prophecy that Kresimir will return. It implies\na great deal of violence accompanying his return. An old legend.”\nLord Vetas remained thoughtful. He dabbed at his neck one last time to\nremove the blood there and put on his hat. “I’ll be back,” he said. “I hope"

He dabbed at his neck one last time to\nremove the blood there and put on his hat. “I’ll be back,” he said. “I hope\nyou’ll have something of greater interest for me when I do. If not…” His\neyes flicked to the box in Adamat’s robe pocket.\nChapter 25\nTaniel wiped the blood from his face and watched a pair of women drag\nanother Watcher away from the bulwark. The man’s skull had been creased\nby a bullet, not a minute after he and Taniel had shared a flagon of wine\nbehind the relative safety of the bastion walls. Taniel closed his eyes and\ntried to remember the man’s face. He’d sketch it later tonight.\nBlood was everywhere; new blood, old blood. Fresh splatters of red on\nthe ground and on Taniel’s coat; old rusty stains on everything. The whole\nbastion smelled of salty iron. The sickly, clogging scent of death wafted up\nfrom below and warred with the clouds of black powder for Taniel’s senses.\nThe Kez were carrying the wounded down the mountainside at an\nalarming rate. Men were pushed and passed along like sacks of grain to\nmake room for new soldiers. A week ago they’d constructed a V shaped\n‑\nslide of lumber that went all the way down to Mopenhague. The dead were\ndumped in and prodded down by men with sticks, their faces wrapped in\nlinen scarves. The wood had long since turned a brownish red. Taniel didn’t\neven want to imagine what that slide smelled like. He could see great pits\non the plains below where the bodies were being dumped.\nTaniel sat with his back against the bulwark, cleaning and reloading his\nrifle. A regular bullet this time—he was running low on redstripes. Beside\nhim, Ka poel wore her long black duster and hat. A bullet had taken a piece\n‑\nout of one lapel. She returned his worried look with a cryptic tilt of her\nhead. He got up on one knee and looked over the bastion wall.\nThe redoubts had fallen weeks ago. No attempt had been made to retake\nthem. Kez soldiers hid on the far side of their walls and waited there for\norders. Taniel caught a soldier peeking too far around the wall and took his\nshot. The man grabbed for his face and yelled. He lost his footing. With a\nstumble he was rolling down the hill, taking two of his comrades with him\nas he grabbed blindly to arrest his fall.\nIf he survived the tumble, he’d be disfigured for life.\nTaniel pushed the thought from his mind and turned around to reload. A\nbullet glanced off the wall near him just a moment after he ducked down.\nHe took a deep breath and began reloading. “Find me a Privileged,” he told\nKa poel. She gave a nod and peeked over the top of the wall.\n‑\nThere’d been weeks of this. Kez soldiers held the mountainside just\nbeyond the first redoubt. They piled soil high on the road to give\nthemselves cover and cowered behind rocks and dirt and whatever they\ncould find. Artillery had been moved up. Blasted remains had tumbled\ndown the mountainside not long after, destroyed by the Watch cannons."

Blasted remains had tumbled\ndown the mountainside not long after, destroyed by the Watch cannons.\nMore artillery moved up, accompanied by shielded Privilegeds. After\ncountless tries, they’d formed a beachhead, and now artillery thumped away\nat the bulwark from at least fifteen cleared spots on the mountainside.\nEvery few hours they rushed the bulwark—like clockwork they formed\nbehind their barriers and readied their weapons. A horn would sound.\nThey’d charge up the hill, only to meet with withering fire. Taniel could\npractically see the promises of glory in their officers’ eyes before he gunned\nthem down. It turned his stomach.\nEach rush failed, yet each time they inched a little closer to the fortress.\nThe Watch was losing men too. Canister shot pierced Bo’s tentative shields\nof sorcery above them. Bullets took musketmen between the eyes when\nthey lined up to take a shot. Even some sorcery was beginning to make it\nthrough. A man had been burned alive by a sliver of Privileged fire\nyesterday. The bastion still smelled of charred flesh.\nTaniel finished loading his rifle with a redstripe and took a few deep\nbreaths. Ka poel flashed a hand signal. Target found. Eleven o’clock from\n‑\nhis position. He pictured it in his mind. One of the gun emplacements.\nHis rise to take a shot was arrested by the arrival of Gavril. The big\nWatchmaster scurried toward Taniel, head down, a bottle of wine in one\nhand and a pewter mug in the other. He fell down beside Taniel, back\nthumping against the bulwark, and waved the bottle under Taniel’s nose.\n“How are things on the front, Marked?” he asked.\nKa poel tapped Taniel’s shoulder. Repeated the hand motions. He took a\n‑\ndeep breath and stood up at the wall. Less than a second to line up his shot.\nHe pulled the trigger and dropped back down, breathing deep of the powder\nsmoke. Ka poel watched. She gave him a nod, but moved her hand,\n‑\nhorizontally at her waist. He’d hit the Privileged, but not a killing shot.\nTaniel gave Gavril his best scowl. “Shot full of holes. Why are you so\nhappy?”\n“Saint Adom’s Festival wine!” Gavril held up the bottle. “They’ve sent\nenough from Adopest to get the whole Kez army drunk. Pity there’s a war\non. Late spring is the only time of year I can abide Adopest. The festival\nwine certainly helps.” He paused to fill the pewter cup and offered it to\nTaniel. Taniel waved him off.\n“Already had a lick,” he said. “Five minutes ago.”\nKa poel took the wine bottle from Gavril’s hand. She upended the\n‑\nbottle, taking deep gulps. Taniel took it from her. “Not too much, girl,” he\nsaid. She snatched the bottle back, taking another draw from it.\n“If they can kill,” Gavril said, “they can drink. This girl’s plenty grown"

Just save enough for me, lass.” Gavril took the bottle back and\ndrained the last of it in one long draft. He smacked his lips, thick cheeks\nflushed, and Taniel wondered how many bottles the Watchmaster had\nalready put away. He felt a little concern—rumor had it that Gavril had\nstarted drinking heavily again during the nights. He hoped it wasn’t true.\nIt wasn’t the only rumor to concern him. “Wine’s all good,” Taniel said.\n“But I’d rather have gunpowder. Any word on the shortage?” They’d gone\nthrough their stores at an alarming rate. What should have lasted a year’s\nsiege was spent in just a few weeks. The Kez just had too many soldiers.\nGavril shook his head. “Nothing from Adopest. The last courier said the\narmy still has plenty. Even still, they shorted us two whole cartloads last\nweek.” He scowled. “I ordered the artillery to go easy the next few days. I\nhave the feeling we’ll be seeing hand to hand soon.”\n‑ ‑\n“You really think they’ll make it over the bulwark?”\n“Eventually.” Gavril suddenly looked very tired. His bulk sagged a\nlittle, and his face revealed a man fighting a war of attrition he felt he might\nlose. “We’ve killed twenty thousand men already. Wounded as many more,\nand yet they keep coming. They say there’s a million down on that plain\nbelow, each one with words of glory and promises of riches in their ears.”\n“I heard Ipille has offered a whole duchy to the officer who leads the\ncharge that breaks us.”\n“Heard the same thing,” Gavril said. “And they’ll make officers of the\nfirst thousand soldiers who follow him in.”\n“That’s a lot of incentive.”\n“Aye. Gives us a lot to shoot at.”\n“They have more men than we have bullets.”\n“How many Privileged you think you’ve killed?”\nTaniel ran his fingers along the notches on the butt of his rifle.\n“Thirteen dead. Wounded twice that many.”\n“That’s a sizable chunk of their royal cabal.”\n“Not enough,” Taniel said.\n“Well, I want you to keep an eye on something else.”\nTaniel frowned. “What’s more important than Privileged?”\n“Sappers,” Gavril said.\nTaniel remembered the sappers. They’d tried to start digging their first\nday on the mountainside, and gunshots had sent them back down the hill\nwith their tails between their legs, not to be seen since. Well, not until the\nother day. They were back at it again, down below the last redoubt—well\nbehind the Kez front line. They were deep enough already that artillery\nwasn’t bothering them, though a couple of cannons had been blasting away\nat their position.\n“Are you really worried about them?” Taniel asked. “It’ll take them\nyears to dig the distance all the way up to us. If they break through, all we\ndo is point a cannon down that hole and fill it with grapeshot.”"

If they break through, all we\ndo is point a cannon down that hole and fill it with grapeshot.”\n“Wish it were that easy,” Gavril said. “Bo says they’ve got help.\nPrivileged. And Julene.”\nTaniel felt his hands begin to shake a little. He stilled them by rubbing\nthem together. “Whatever she feels like helping with can’t be good news\nfor us. Still. You want me to shoot at sappers?”\n“Not the sappers themselves. Watch for the Privileged helping them.”\n“Gavril!”\nBo joined them at the bulwark, crossing the yard at a dead run. He\ndropped down on the other side of Taniel, breathing hard. Taniel could tell\nhe was exhausted. His cheeks were sunken, all traces of fat gone, and his\nhair dirty and scraggly. There was mud on his face, from Kresimir-knew-\nwhat.\n“They’re planning something big,” Bo said.\n“The sappers?” Gavril asked. “We know about them.”\n“No,” Bo snapped. “Right now. The…” He stopped as the sound of\nenemy artillery suddenly fell off. There was a moment of silence before a\nWatch cannon fired, followed by the cracks of muskets. There was no\nreturn from the Kez side. Bo went on. “All their Privileged are gathered just\nbelow the last redoubt, near their sappers.”\nTaniel shrugged.\n“Over a hundred!” Bo said. “They don’t get together like that for a\npicnic. There’s officers there, too, I wouldn’t doubt. They’re getting ready\nfor a big push.”\nGavril stood up, looking over the bulwark. Taniel closed his eyes and\nwaited.\n“Shit,” Gavril said, dropping back down. “You might be right. They’ve\ngot men coming up all quiet on the road. Lots of them. I saw a few black\njackets among them.”\n“Wardens?” Taniel said. “Pit.”\nGavril climbed to his feet and was away, barking orders at the\nWatchers, yelling for every able-bodied man.\n“How can you miss that?” Bo said after Gavril was gone. “Aren’t you\nshooting at the bastards?”\nTaniel pointed at Ka poel. “She’s my spotter. I’m always behind cover.”\n‑\nKa poel flashed a number of hand signals.\n‑\n“She said they have only gathered in the last few minutes,” Taniel said.\n“Well, be ready for whatever…”\nBo threw his hand up in a warding gesture. A second later a canister\nshot went off right above their heads, the echo of the blast ringing through\nthe bastion. Bo’s shields flashed red as the bullets clattered off them, then\nfell harmlessly to the ground. Canisters exploded over the entire length of\nthe bastion, the sound deafening. The wall at Taniel’s back shook with the\nimpact of cannonballs. He glanced at Ka poel. Her eyes were dark. She\n‑\nhadn’t even flinched.\n“They must be firing every damned artillery they have!” Taniel said\nabove the din. Bo ignored him. His face was strained, his hands flashing at"

His face was strained, his hands flashing at\nan incredible speed as he worked sorcery to shield the air above the bastion.\nThe bombardment was withering. Bo’s eyes began to water, veins\nstanding out on his forehead. Fire flashed above them, and Taniel knew that\nsorcery was backing up the Kez artillery.\nWatchers rushed beneath Bo’s shields, flinching at the explosions\nabove, carrying sacks and torches. One Watcher set a sack gently beside\nTaniel and was off for another after a quick glance at Bo and a muttered\nprayer. Taniel looked inside the sack. It was full of clay balls as large as a\nman’s fist. Grenados. They expected the Kez to get close today indeed.\n“Fix bayonets!” Gavril’s bellow rose above the concussion of artillery.\nTaniel felt his heart beat faster. He pulled his ring bayonet from its leather\ncase in his pack and slid it over the end of his rifle. With a twist it locked\ninto place.\n“Ready!” Gavril yelled.\nTaniel checked his rifle—already loaded. He glanced at Bo. The\nPrivileged was doing all he could do to stay standing while his fingers\nflashed commands to unseen elements. His shields were beginning to break\ndown. On the other end of the bulwark a canister shot went off within the\nshield. Men screamed and fell, and a cannon lost its crew.\nTaniel peeked over the edge of the bulwark as a trumpet sounded. The\nmountainside suddenly swarmed with Kez soldiers. They rushed up the\nroad, they climbed the steep rocks. Every inch of mountainside was\ncovered. Where had they been hiding all of these men so close to the\nfortress?\n“Aim!”\nTaniel picked out an officer near the front. The man’s white feather\nwriggled in the air as he ran up the road at the head of his men, waving his\nsword in the air. The Kez troops plowed on behind him, bayonets fixed on\ntheir muskets. A black coat among all the red and gold caught his eye and\nhe changed targets. His heart beat loudly in his ears. Wardens. Lots of them,\nscattered among the troops. They carried big knives in their teeth like\nsailors as they scrambled over the rocks on the mountainside, heading\nstraight for the slanted walls of the bulwark.\n“Fire!”\nTaniel pulled the trigger. He burned a little powder, giving extra oomph\nto the ball. A cloud of spent gunpowder burst into the air, obscuring his\nvision for a moment. It cleared, and yells of dismay echoed through the\nbastion.\nOnly one man fell from the volley: the Warden Taniel had shot right\nbetween the eyes with a redstripe. Bullets and grapeshot burst into sparks\nand fell harmlessly to the ground a few feet in front of the first ranks. The\nKez charge didn’t even falter.\n“They have Privileged in their ranks!” Taniel yelled.\n“Fire at will!” came the order.\nHe snatched for his purse of redstripes and opened his third eye. A wave"

    "text": "“They have Privileged in their ranks!” Taniel yelled.\n“Fire at will!” came the order.\nHe snatched for his purse of redstripes and opened his third eye. A wave\nof nausea came over him, which he pushed away as he reloaded. He didn’t\nhave time for powder. He simply dropped a redstripe down his muzzle and\nrammed cotton swabbing in after it. He sighted down the rifle, opened his\nthird eye.\nPastel colors from the third sight made his head spin. The invisible\nshield the Kez Privileged were using became a translucent, yellow sheen\npartially obscuring all behind it. He struggled to pick through the colors\nbeyond. Wardens glowed, and so did Knacked among the Kez troops.\nTaniel looked for the brightest colors—the Privileged. He picked one out\nand pulled the trigger. The man jerked and dropped, and Taniel loaded\nanother redstripe.\nHe managed two more before the Kez reached the walls. The thunder of\nartillery suddenly dropped off.\nGavril’s voice shouted, “Hold!”\nTaniel heard Bo wheeze. He spun in time to catch Bo under one arm\nand lower him to the ground. Bo shook his head. “Keep going!” he\ncoughed. “You’re weakening them.” His eyes grew wide and he lurched to\nhis feet. “They’re dropping the shield!”\n“Fire!” Gavril roared.\nAnother cloud of powder swirled up around them as the line fired away.\nA dead silence briefly touched the bulwark, and then men were scrambling\nto reload as artillery captains barked orders.\nThe smoke cleared.\nThe volley of shots had torn through the first few ranks. Men dropped\nby the score. Wounded tossed themselves to the side, trying not to be\ntrampled by those behind. They could not get out of the way. There were\ntoo many soldiers. Adran cannons fired grapeshot, the sound pounding\naway at Taniel’s ears.\nOnly Wardens remained standing after the grapeshot. They pushed\nonward, wet stains on their black coats betraying blood loss, yet seemingly\nno worse for the wear. They bellowed in defiance, shook their knives in the\nair, and waved to the ranks behind them. The dead were trodden underfoot.\n“Grenados!”\nThe clay balls were lit on torches along the wall and tossed over.\nExplosions bit into the Kez numbers. A few Wardens were blasted to\npieces.\nKez swarmed the base of the bulwark like angry hornets. Ladders were\nput in place, and grappling hooks thrown. Taniel snatched for a hatchet as a\nhook landed beside him. He cut the rope with one chop and jumped up,\nfiring at a Privileged at the bottom of the wall.\nWardens scrambled up the slanted walls of the bastion as if they were\nlight inclines. They made it up the wall in moments, and a half dozen\njumped down among the Watchers.\n“To bayonets!” Gavril yelled. “Keep up the cannon fire!”\nOne great, ugly head poked over the bulwark right in front of Ka poel.\n‑\nTaniel swung his rifle toward the Warden, but Ka poel was faster. Her hand\n‑\njabbed forward, revealing a long needle that had been hidden in her sleeve."

Her hand\n‑\njabbed forward, revealing a long needle that had been hidden in her sleeve.\nIt went through the Warden’s eye and into his brain. The creature let go his\nhandholds and fell.\nTaniel stabbed a Kez soldier in the shoulder as he scrambled over the\nwall. He cracked the next man with the butt of his rifle and tried to load\nanother redstripe. The Kez were coming too fast. He took a quick snort of\npowder and gripped his rifle in both hands, sure he wouldn’t get off another\nshot. He readied himself for the next wave—they’d find a trance-taken\npowder mage ready for them.\nA Warden came over the wall with one hand on the brick, the other\nclutching a knife big enough to cut Taniel in two. Ka poel leapt for him, but\n‑\nwas batted away like a doll. Taniel yelled, thrusting his bayonet. The\nWarden reached long arms over the rifle, ignoring fourteen inches of steel\nthrough his middle, and backhanded Taniel. Taniel stumbled. The blow had\nrattled him even in a powder trance.\nThe Warden spotted Bo on the ground and pushed himself off Taniel’s\nbayonet. Bo raised his hands, trying to manage some defense, but the\nWarden leapt upon him in a moment, knife raised.\nTaniel reached the Warden as he was about to stab Bo. He thrust his\nbayonet, spitting the creature like a hog. The Warden’s head turned,\nsurprised that Taniel had regained his feet so quickly. The Warden tried to\nuse his weight and strength as leverage to throw Taniel’s grip on his rifle.\nTaniel would have none of it. He could feel the barrel of his rifle strain\nas he shoved the Warden back against the bastion wall. He set his feet and\nlifted, dumping the Warden over the edge. He hoped the creature’s wounds\nwould prevent it from climbing the bastion again.\nHe paused for just a moment to help Ka poel to her feet. She was\n‑\nrattled, but unhurt.\nGavril appeared by his side. “Get back to shooting,” he snarled as he\ngrabbed a Kez soldier by the throat. He lifted the man, one-handed, and\ntossed him over the wall. “Kill the Privileged!”\nSuddenly Fesnik was there with Gavril, a small sword in one hand, a\nlong pole in the other, pushing away the ladders. Under their cover, Taniel\ngrabbed his bag of redstripes. He dropped two balls in, rammed down the\ncotton, and took aim.\nAngle floating, powder mages called it—when you fire a bullet and\npush it in one sharp direction, around a wall or even around a person. Taniel\nhad seen his father do it on many occasions—it was said Tamas was the\nvery best.\nTaniel generally had a hard time with angle floating, and often failed to\nmake the angle sharp enough. It took precision timing and a damned huge\namount of concentration. Taniel couldn’t manage that concentration. A\nfailed angle floater made his head feel like it had been pounded by a\nhammer. A successful one hurt more."

A successful one hurt more.\nWhat Taniel could do was nudge bullets. Nudging a bullet was no more\nthan burning some powder to correct your aim while the bullet was in flight\n—much like floating itself. It took little more than a sharp eye, yet he’d\nnever seen anyone shoot farther nor more accurately than he could. And he\ncould do it with two bullets.\nKa poel pointed out a pair of Privileged about ten paces from each\n‑\nother. They stood down beside the easy cover of the redoubts, some\nhundred paces away and protected by their personal shields. Taniel lined up\nthe shot and pulled the trigger.\nBoth men dropped, taking the separate bullets to the chest. A third\nPrivileged saw them fall. Taniel ducked behind the wall.\nHe signaled to Ka poel to stay down. The Privileged would be watching\n‑\nfor him now. He couldn’t stop shooting. He took a few deep breaths and\nloaded one bullet and pictured that third Privileged in his mind’s eye. Less\nthan a second to aim and shoot. He crawled, rifle in hand, changing his\nposition on the wall by five paces. A few quick breaths and he sprang up.\nThe Privileged had his hands up, fingers twitching. An arch of lightning\nsprang from the air above him as Taniel pulled the trigger. The lightning\nslammed into the spot Taniel had been a few moments before, the force of\nthe impact powerful enough to knock Taniel, Gavril, Ka poel, Fesnik, and a\n‑\ndozen Kez soldiers off their feet.\nThe bullet drifted high and ripped through the Privileged’s throat. He\nwent down in a spray of blood.\nTaniel breathed a sigh of relief.\nA horn resounded across the mountainside. The sound of fighting\ntapered off as the Kez soldiers retreated back down the mountain.\nGavril pushed away a soldier he’d been grappling with. He held a fist\nabove his head. “Cease fire!” The cannons silenced. Kez soldiers within the\nbulwark threw down their weapons. Gavril scowled at them. “We’re not\ntaking prisoners,” he said. “Surrender your weapons and gear, and then\ndown the mountain with you.”\nWord passed throughout the bastion. Kez climbed back over the walls\nafter being relieved of their muskets and powder, and began the long walk\namong their dead. Gavril found a Kez officer among the wounded and took\nhim by the shoulder while Taniel watched.\n“Tell Field Marshal Tine that he can send some unarmed soldiers up to\ncollect your dead. And I suggest we all take a few days to tend to the\nwounded.” Gavril repeated the order in Kez to be sure he was understood.\nThe officer nodded wearily and, with the help of a Kez soldier, headed\nover the wall and down the mountain.\nTaniel dropped down beside Bo.\n“You OK?”\nBo gave him a long look.\n“I’ll take that as a no.”\n“To the pit with all this,” Bo managed.\nKaterine, Rina, and Alasin appeared as if from nowhere.

Ka poel punched him in the arm.\n‑\n“I’ve tried juggling more than one woman at once,” Gavril said. “It’s a\npain in the ass. Don’t know how Privileged do it.”\n“They treat ’em like shit,” Taniel said.\n“Bo doesn’t,” Gavril said. “I guess I should say, ‘I don’t know how Bo\ndoes it.’”\nThey turned and watched the retreating Kez in silence for a moment.\n“You really saved our asses there,” Gavril said.\nTaniel gave Gavril a surprised look. “Huh?”\n“You didn’t know?”\nGavril slapped his knee and gave a loud guffaw. Watchers, tending to\nthe dead and wounded, paused to give Gavril odd looks. “You mean you\ndon’t know who you shot?”\n“A Privileged?” He bent over, picked up a discarded bottle of St.\nAdom’s Festival wine. Somehow it had gone unbroken through all of this.\nHe took a swig. After a moment’s hesitation he handed it to Ka poel. She\n‑\ndrank once and gave it back.\n“At a hundred yards even I recognized him,” Gavril said. “That last one,\nthe one that hit us with a lightning bolt hard enough to knock through the\nwards on the bastion. That was Brajon the Callous.”\nTaniel choked on a mouthful of wine. “The head of the Kez Cabal?”\n“The same,” Gavril said.\nTaniel felt his knees weaken beneath him. He put a hand on the bastion\nwall for support. “I would never have stood up if I had known it was him.\nBrajon was in Fatrasta at the beginning of the war. He almost ended it\nhimself. Wiped out an entire Fatrastan army—singlehandedly.

Taniel watched\nas Gavril took stock of the damage to the bastion. “You know,” Taniel said,\n“we could have kept firing after they sounded the retreat.

Otherwise it’s\nback to the Bleakening for all of us, and Kresimir be damned.”\nGavril left him then. Taniel looked over the edge of the bastion. He\nthought to open his third eye to track their Privileged, but decided it would\njust give him a headache.\nA thought troubled him. If that was their big push, then where was\nJulene? He searched the hillside for the entrance to the sapper tunnels.\nThere was some movement there, and he thought he saw a man empty a\nwheelbarrow of dirt.\nTamas stared up at the ceiling of a small room, his vision blurry. There\nwasn’t much to see even had his eyes been clear. He could make out the\nslanted logs of a roof, plain wood with mud in the cracks to seal them\nagainst the weather. It was light, barely. His body told him it was dawn.\nThe light was gloomy, indicative of a stormy day ahead. He heard the crow\nof a rooster, and the sound of hoofbeats, followed by a muffled\nconversation. The men outside spoke Kez.\nHe couldn’t feel his right leg. It wasn’t a pleasant sensation, and\ncombined with his blurry vision Tamas had to fight rising panic. Without a\nleg or good vision, what hope did he have of escape? He breathed deeply,\ncalming himself, and assessed the rest of his body for wounds.\nBoth of his hands and arms still seemed to work. They moved when\nprompted. He could feel the stab of a straw mattress beneath him. His chest\nhurt when he took too deep a breath, but not enough for a broken rib. His\nside was tender, perhaps from a cut or a bruise. He touched it gently. A\nbruise, he decided. He was in short undergarments and nothing else, and\nyears of instinct told him he was not alone in the room.\nTamas struggled to push himself into a sitting position. He’d been\nprovided with neither blanket nor pillow, and lay upon a filthy straw\nmattress on a wooden frame. There was a window on his left, and stairs\ngoing down at the end of the bed. He rubbed his eyes, which improved his\nvision slightly. A Warden sat in the corner, his muscled, malformed body\neasy to recognize, though Tamas could not make out much more than the\noutline of the body.\n“Where am I?” Tamas said.\nThe blurry mountain of flesh seemed to regard him for a moment, then\nmumbled something unintelligible in Kez.\n“Where am I?” Tamas repeated.\nThe Warden left the room.\n“Where am I,” Tamas shouted after the Warden. He pushed himself up\nfarther. “Monster. Beast!” He lay back down, what little strength he had\nnow gone. His head had begun to throb when he moved. He felt along the\nwrapping gingerly, grimacing. The slightest touch brought a jolt of pain,\nand he eventually left it alone. He’d been treated. They’d covered his\nwounds in strips of dirty linen. His leg was wrapped tight, but there was\nstill circulation. He wouldn’t be walking on it any time soon. He heard steps"

He heard steps\nfrom below, and two pairs of boots upon the stairs. The Warden returned,\nwith him a smaller man.\n“Field Marshal,” a voice said in accented Adran. Tamas felt his hackles\nrise at the sound of the voice.\n“Nikslaus,” he spat. “I thought I threw you in the Adsea.”\nThe duke’s voice was genial. “My Wardens fished me out. How is your\nleg?”\n“It’s fantastic,” Tamas said. “I’m going to dance a jig. Where am I?”\nNikslaus took the Warden’s seat in the corner of the room, while the\nWarden stood at the foot of the bed. “Deep in the King’s Wood,” he said.\n“Now, my surgeon said you’d hit your head hard when you fell. Are you\nhaving any problems with your vision?”\n“No,” Tamas lied.\n“Of course you are,” Nikslaus said. “I can tell that your eyes aren’t\nfocusing. I’ll have the surgeon take a look at you before we go.”\nTamas did his best to glare at Nikslaus, but found it hard when he could\nbarely see him. “Why the pit am I still alive? Where are we going?”\n“To Kez,” Nikslaus said. “I advised against it, but after that first\nWarden didn’t kill you, Ipille decided that we should send a message. If\neverything goes as scheduled, you’ll face the guillotine beneath my king’s\ngaze on the final day of Saint Adom’s Festival.”\n“You’ve planned this for a long time,” Tamas said.\n“One of many contingencies. We need to be rid of you, one way or\nanother, if we’re to take Adro. You’re the strongest of the powder mages\nand a tactical genius—I don’t mind saying it, it’s the truth. The mercenaries\nwill give us some fight, but you’re the backbone of your army. Your\nsoldiers will crumble without you.”\n“You underestimate them,” Tamas said.\n“Perhaps.” Nikslaus seemed unworried. “The dominoes will fall,\nTamas. You’re only the first. Adro is outnumbered. With your head in a\nbasket, we will whittle away at the Mountainwatch and hunt down your\npowder mages. We have every advantage.”\nTamas gazed at his hands, trying desperately to focus on them. “What\nhappened to my leg?”\n“My fault,” Nikslaus said. “The boulder you were hiding behind\ncracked in a particular way, and then exploded when I applied enough\nsorcery. A fragment glanced your leg. Shattered it, I’m afraid.\n“But I wouldn’t worry much about it,” Nikslaus continued. “Our\nsurgeon says it might heal, in time. He’s quite gifted. Put it back together\nand stitched the flesh up like no one would know.” Nikslaus stood up and\napproached the bed. He leaned forward, just out of Tamas’s reach. “You’re\na few hundred krana richer, Tamas,” he said in a low voice. He tilted his"

He tilted his\nhead toward Tamas’s leg. “There’s a star of gold in there, right up against\nthe bone. You’ve been cured.”\nTamas lurched forward and swung a fist at the blurry image of the duke.\nHis body screamed at him, his leg sending a fiery needle of pain up his\nbody that made his stomach lurch. Nikslaus danced out of the way.\n“Cured.” That’s what Nikslaus thought of it. Gold in the bloodstream of\na powder mage was anathema. It removed their ability to sense and touch\npowder, to enter a trance.\nNikslaus gave a chuckle. “You’re cured, Tamas, but it won’t help your\ncause. Your neck will rest beneath the same guillotine blade that took your\nwife’s head all those years ago. You won’t go to your death as a powder\nmage. You’ll go as the son of a poor apothecary.”\nTamas’s blood thumped hard in his ears and his hands shook violently.\nHe wanted to reach out and take Nikslaus by the throat. He longed to have\nfinished what he started on the docks. Yet he could do nothing. He was\npowerless.\nIt was not a familiar feeling. For as long as Tamas could remember, his\nmagery had been there. Even when not in a powder trance, he could sense\nnearby sorcerers and tell where and how much powder there was within\nhundreds of paces. He could detonate charges or kegs, he could breathe in\nthe acrid smoke and send his body into a berserk rage.\nHe had none of that now. Only his hands and a shattered leg, and vision\nblurred by a concussion. He sank back onto the bed and felt moisture roll\ndown his face. He turned away from Nikslaus as best he could.\nThe duke left him in silence. Even the Warden was gone. It was plain to\nsee that Tamas could do nothing, and from the growing noise outside the\nroom there was plenty else to be done than watch one broken old man.\nNikslaus’s voice was louder than the others. He gave orders with the\narrogance of the nobility. Tamas forced his hands to stop shaking. He lifted\nhis good leg and put one foot on the floor. He pushed himself up.\nHe nearly collapsed there. It took all of his strength to keep from falling\nflat on his face. He put one hand on the wall, the other on a bedpost. He\npushed himself over to the window, hopping on one leg. He stopped only to\nvomit, the pain finally overcoming his gag suppression, and then he was at\nthe window.\nTamas sank to the floor, careful to avoid the puddle of bile, and put his\nhead against the cool wall. He could hear Nikslaus almost as clearly as if he\nstood next to him. Nikslaus either didn’t count on Tamas eavesdropping or\ndidn’t care.\n“We’ll take the long road to Adopest,” Nikslaus said in Kez. “I don’t\ncare what the scouts say, I’ll not risk encountering those fools from the\nhunt.”"

They stopped outside\nthe window.\n“Well?” Nikslaus said.\n“We tracked down four more, my lord,” a deep voice responded. There\nwas a guttural quality to the voice, so Tamas knew it was a Warden.\n“Is that the last of them?” Nikslaus said.\n“No telling. With our man dead, we don’t know how many men Ryze\nbrought with him. I suspect we have them all.”\n“Don’t underestimate that brigadier,” Nikslaus snarled. “He was one of\nWinceslav’s best. He’ll have had outriders in case anything happened.\nLeave two Wardens to hunt.”\n“We had to dodge patrols. They’re looking for Tamas.”\n“We’ll be gone before they reach us. Go help the others. We leave\nwithin the hour.”\nWith powder mages on his trail, Nikslaus would be in a hurry to get\naway. Tamas’s mood began to rise, only to plummet as logic set in. They\nhad been hours away from the hunt. Half a day from Adopest. Sabon might\nnot even know he was missing yet. And that was all based on the possibility\nthat Nikslaus let the others get away. How many Wardens did he have with\nhim? Did Nikslaus send them after Olem, Charlemund, and the rest?\nTamas gave a weary sigh. Even if they were to find him, what was he?\nJust an old man now. No more a powder mage.\nChapter 26\nAdamat spent nearly a week investigating Ondraus the Reeve before\nmaking an appointment to interview the man. He almost canceled the\nappointment due to wild speculation that had reached the city that morning:\nTamas disappearing from the Orchard Valley Hunt the day before, a rogue\nbrigadier, sorcery in the King’s Forest. None of the rumors could be\nconfirmed, so Adamat went on with the interview, though he had an\nunsettling feeling that he might no longer be employed.\nHe arrived at the reeve’s home at five past the hour, late for his meeting\nbecause he’d passed the house four times without finding it. The house\nitself was behind a hedgerow, wedged between two manors and easily\nmistaken for some kind of servants’ quarters. There was a small garden\nbetween the hedgerow and front step, meticulously cared for, not a blade of\ngrass or flower petal out of place. The house was utilitarian—a simple\nA frame made of fine, but not expensive, brick.\n‑\nThe door opened as Adamat lifted his hand to the knocker. An old\nwoman peered up at him. She wore a drab maid’s frock, a simple wool shirt\nthat went all the way down to her ankles.\n“I’m here to—”\n“See the reeve,” she cut him off. “You’re late.”\n“I’m sorry, I couldn’t find…”\nThe old woman turned and hobbled away in the middle of his sentence.\nAdamat trailed off. He swallowed his annoyance and followed her into the\nhouse."

    "text": "“I’m sorry, I couldn’t find…”\nThe old woman turned and hobbled away in the middle of his sentence.\nAdamat trailed off. He swallowed his annoyance and followed her into the\nhouse.\nThe inside was as unremarkable as the outside. The mantelpiece was\nclear of knickknacks, the shelves freshly dusted and also empty but for two\nrows of bookkeeper’s volumes. A single chair sat before an empty fireplace.\nThere were three doorways. One led to an alcove of a kitchen, where the\nonly sign of use was a fresh loaf of bread on the table. The second door was\nclosed—presumably the bedroom—and the third door was open, showing\nthe reeve sitting at a small desk in the corner, spectacles balanced on the tip\nof his nose as his finger ran across the page of a book of numbers.\nThe housekeeper clucked to herself and went into the kitchen, leaving\nAdamat to show himself in to the reeve. Adamat watched her for a moment,\nand wondered if the kitchen was used at all—there was no smell of baking,\nor undue heat from a cooking fire, so she must have bought the bread\nsomewhere else. She turned and caught him watching her and shut the\nkitchen door.\nAdamat turned his attention to the little man sitting at a desk. He’s more\nthan he seemed, Ricard had warned. Well, what did he seem? A dusty\nbookkeeper. An accountant—though admittedly the finest one in Adro. So\nwhat more could he be? Anything, Adamat supposed.\n“You’re late.” The reeve didn’t bother to look up from his book as\nAdamat entered.\n“My apologies. The streets are awfully full, with the festival and all.”\nAdamat didn’t bother adding how unusual it was to hold appointments on a\nfestival evening. Something told him the reeve didn’t actually enjoy having\nfun.\n“Save the excuses for someone else. Don’t waste my time,\nInvestigator,” the reeve said. “I didn’t try to have Tamas killed. I have\nneither the patience nor time to answer your questions. The ledgers still\nneed to be kept in Tamas’s absence.” He made a face, realizing that he had\nlet something slip.\n“So he is missing?” Adamat asked.\nThe reeve glared at him.\nAdamat examined the reeve for a moment. Ondraus was a small man,\nbent from decades of leaning over a desk, shoulders hunched. His face was\nlong, his cheeks sallow, shoulders narrow. Ondraus was one of the most\nwell known men in Adopest. This was quite the feat, considering that he\nrarely showed his face in public, he had never sat for a portrait, and he\nreportedly tried to alienate everyone he met. Adamat could see that the last\nseemed to hold true. He could also see that Ondraus would not be talking\nabout Tamas’s disappearance.\nAdamat’s weeklong investigation had turned up frustratingly little. The\nreeve handled the nation’s treasury—with the exception of the king’s purse,\nthough there was a rumor that that had changed with Manhouch’s execution\n—from that little desk in the corner. He had an office on Joon Street, which\nhe never visited, where a team of bookkeepers did most of the labor."

    "text": "—from that little desk in the corner. He had an office on Joon Street, which\nhe never visited, where a team of bookkeepers did most of the labor.\nEverything they did was double-checked by the reeve. He had no known\nhobbies, no known friends. His housekeeper had been with him for forty-\nsome years, but no one considered them to be friends. He had one\nbodyguard, who went with him whenever he left the house, which was rare.\nRumor had it the reeve had ridden at the hunt, that he had been there\nwhen Tamas disappeared. Adamat couldn’t picture the man on a horse.\n“You don’t seem the type of man to betray his country,” Adamat said. “As\nthe city reeve you could undermine Adro from its very heart without Kez help.\nIt’s not a question of money. My research indicates that you’re one of the\nwealthiest men in Adro. You receive two hundred thousand krana a year for\nservices rendered, and you own three million acres of farmland in Fatrasta,\nhalf a million acres of Bakashcan coastline that includes a major port, a coal\nmine in Deliv, and half of a trading company in Kez. I do wonder at all the\nforeign stock. Do you not have faith in your country?”\n“You’d know if you were more thorough,” Ondraus said. “I own three\ngold mines and twelve Mountainwatch toll roads. I own three hundred and\ntwelve thousand acres of vineyards, and I finance a merchants’ guild in the\nnorth.” He waved his hand dismissively. “Ask your friend, Ricard Tumblar,\nif you want to know more. I personally employ three thousand of his union\nworkers in my ironworks.”\n“Among other factories,” Adamat said.\nOndraus’s eyes narrowed. “You knew.”\n“I was just curious what you’d catalog as the most valuable.”\n“If you don’t suspect me, then why are we having this conversation?”\n“I never said I don’t suspect you. I’ll admit you are low on my list. I\nwant to know, sir, what the books tell you.”\n“I don’t get your meaning.”\nBy the way Ondraus’s hand tightened on his ledger Adamat suspected\nhe understood perfectly. “Money. You track everything. Even things a\nreeve shouldn’t know you have cataloged.” Adamat pointed at the ledger\nwith his cane. “I’ve taken a look at your books on Joon Street. Very\nthorough. Very impressive.”\n“Those aren’t for public eyes,” Ondraus snapped.\n“I’m not the public. I had to bully my way past your clerks. They’re\nvery loyal to you. Now, tell me, what does the flow of money tell you?”\nOndraus watched him through those bespectacled eyes for several\nmoments before he responded. Calculations were being made, thoughts\nsliding into place.\n“If the motive is money,” Ondraus said, “which it almost always is, then\nyou have nothing to suspect of either the Proprietor or Lady Winceslav. I’ve\nhad access to the Winceslav books for months now and there is absolutely\nnothing irregular about them. The Proprietor—well, criminal or not, he pays\nhis taxes.

A man who\npays his taxes like that is not concerned with the day to day of the\n‑ ‑\ngovernment. He wants nothing more than a stable world in which to expand\nhis influence slowly, assuredly.”\n“War can mean a great deal of money for an opportunist.”\n“Opportunists do not pay their taxes,” Ondraus said.\n“And the other councillors?”\nOndraus sniffed. “Prime Lektor is a mystery. The man’s finances do not\nexist. Very strange, that. Aside from the occasional grant from the\nuniversity, it’s as if money does not even go through his hands. Ricard\nTumblar is a businessman. He cooks the books as well as he can. He’s\nreceived very large sums of money lately from Brudania and from banks in\nFatrasta and Gurla.”\n“Brudania is a major ally of Kez.”\n“And the banks in Gurla are owned by the Kez.”\n“Fatrasta is not an ally,” Adamat said. “And I’m not sure if I can trust\nwhat you say about Ricard. The unionization of your workers must have\ninfuriated you.”\n“Did it?” Ondraus raised an eyebrow. “His unions have organized\nproduction in a way even I couldn’t. Revenue has increased three hundred\npercent in my ironworks and gold mines since the unions came in. Ask\nRicard. I did not bar them. I welcomed the unions.”\nOndraus made a dismissive gesture, moving on. “Then there’s the arch-\ndiocel. As a man of the cloth his movements are completely shrouded in\nsecrecy. No one outside of their order may so much as glance at their\nbooks. Yet he spends enough to make a king weep. Far more than his\nallowance as an arch-diocel. I often wonder at that.”\n“And yourself?”\n“I am to suspect myself?”\n“Is there any reason you’d want Tamas killed?”\n“Tamas is spending too much on the army and too much on spies. This\nis wartime, however, so his expenditures are practical. He’s increased\npublic rations higher than I would like, but that came about from a previous\nagreement of ours. A ferret could run this country better than Manhouch\ndid. At least Tamas listens to my advice.”\nOndraus went on without prompting. “If Tamas were to die, the military\nleadership would not be up to the task of holding off the Kez. The Kez\nwould conquer Adro, and Adopest would be taxed. The Kez have a long\nhistory of excessive tax on their colonies in Fatrasta and Gurla. We would\nbe no different, and the city coffers would be even worse off than they were\nunder Manhouch.”\nAdamat considered, not for the first time, Ondraus’s singular position of\npower. If he wanted to thwart Tamas, he could be far more subtle than by\nhaving him killed. He could just tell Tamas there was no money to pay the\narmy or feed the people. Tamas would have riots within a month and be\ncompletely undone within two."

Tamas would have riots within a month and be\ncompletely undone within two.\nWhat he’d said about Ricard bothered Adamat. Ricard may have been\nthe head of the Warriors of Labor and received a great deal of money, but\nhe was not wealthy in the way that people like Ondraus or Charlemund\nconsidered wealth. He was no king. The Kez had the money to make him\none.\nAdamat said, “Thank you for your time. I think I’m done here. I may\nreturn if I have further questions.”\nThe reeve turned back to his ledger without another word.\n“I’ll show myself out,” Adamat said.\nNikslaus, whether he feared Tamas or not, was taking no chances. Tamas\nsat facing backward in the carriage. He wore wrist and ankle irons, both of\nthem bolted to the floor by thick chains in the style of a prison wagon. A\nWarden sat next to Tamas, his twisted bulk pushing Tamas against the side\nof the wagon. Tamas’s skin crawled being so close to one of the creatures.\nDespite the irons, the carriage was fit for a duke. Nikslaus sat opposite\nTamas upon a velvet cushion, which left plenty of room for his legs. The\nwall covering and window hangings matched the cushion and did a little to\nmuffle the sound from outside. The carriage had recently ceased its rocking\nmotion and now moved upon a cobbled thoroughfare. From the sound of\nincreasing traffic they were getting close to the city.\nNikslaus appeared deep in his own thoughts. His fingers danced in his\nlap, sheathed in white, runed Privileged’s gloves. Tamas wondered whether\nhe was doing some sort of unseen sorcery, or simply passing the time.\nTamas lifted a finger to the curtains and glanced outside. There was nothing\nof interest to see. At the sound of his chains jingling, Nikslaus glanced at\nhim. He nodded to the Warden, who reached out and firmly moved Tamas’s\nhand from the window.\nTamas sighed. At least his vision had cleared. They’d left the farmhouse\nlate in the afternoon the day before. Something had calmed Nikslaus and he\nseemed no longer worried they’d be caught. Tamas sent his senses inward,\nthen probed out. He tried to open his third eye.\nPowder mages were the only kind of sorcerer whose power could be\ndisrupted like this. Tamas didn’t know how it had been discovered, or\nwhen, but gold in the bloodstream could render a powder mage’s power\ncompletely null. It even blocked their ability to see the Else. Removal of a\nPrivileged’s hands at the wrist was said to keep them from manipulating the\nElse, but not from seeing it.\n“I’m not a bad man,” Nikslaus said suddenly.\nTamas gave him a glance. The duke stared at him, a troubled look on\nhis face.\n“I don’t revel in your discomfort, or smile at the thought of your doom,”\nNikslaus said.\nTamas said, “Such knowledge would not keep me from choking the life\nout of you, given the chance.”\nNikslaus gave him a distracted smile. “I’ll be glad not to give you such"

If my hands were struck from me and my ability to\ntouch the other side was gone. It was a harrowing thought.”\n“You’ll not win any goodwill from me,” Tamas said.\n“I simply want you to know,” Nikslaus responded, “that I don’t do any\nof this out of pleasure. I act on the whim of my king. I am but a servant.”\n“Were you a servant when you delivered the head of my wife in a cedar\nbox?” Tamas said. The sentence began calmly. By the time he finished it,\nhe was snarling, his anger bared. It had come upon him like a rogue wave.\nHis chains jingled and clanked. The Warden gave him a dangerous look.\nNikslaus calmed the Warden with a raised hand. “Yes,” he said. “I was\na servant.”\n“You enjoyed it,” Tamas said through gritted teeth. “Admit it.”\nBitterness dripped from his voice. “You enjoyed ordering the headsman’s\nblade, you enjoyed bringing her head to me and seeing my sorrow, and you\nenjoy seeing me incapacitated now.”\nNikslaus seemed to think on this. “You’re right,” he finally said.\nTamas fell silent, shocked that Nikslaus would admit such a thing. It\nwas beneath a duke.\n“When you put it that way… I did enjoy it, and I still do,” Nikslaus\nsaid. “But not for the reasons you think. This isn’t personal. Powder mages\nare a stain. A black blot on sorcery. I don’t take relish in another person’s\nsuffering. I take pride in seeing a powder mage struck down, as I did when\nIpille ordered the death of your wife.”\n“It makes you no less a beast,” Tamas said. He glanced sideways at the\nWarden. “No less a beast than the ones who made this.”\nNikslaus’s eyes narrowed. “Says the powder mage. Your kind are more\nmonstrous than Wardens by far.” He looked at the ceiling. “I’ll never\nunderstand the minds of such as you, Tamas. We’ve both got our\nprejudices, I suppose.” He snorted. “Had you been born a Privileged, you\nwould have made a formidable ally.”\n“Or opponent,” Tamas said.\n“No,” Nikslaus said. “Not an opponent. Our antagonism toward one\nanother is based solely upon your being a powder mage.”\n“I’m Adran,” Tamas said quietly. “You’re Kez.”\n“And the Adran Cabal would have been enfolded into the Kez Cabal,\nhad the Accords been signed. As they should have been.”\n“Does Ipille really expect to rule Adro?”\nNikslaus blinked at Tamas. “Of course.”\nTamas could see in Nikslaus’s eyes that there was no doubt there.

Is it simply revenge? Or do you honestly think you have\nthe best interests of Adro at heart?”\n“Do you honestly think it is in Adro’s best interest to bow to Kez?”\nTamas countered. “No, don’t answer. I can see it in your face. You’re as\nblind a nobleman and monarchal stooge as any of those that I sent to the\nguillotine. Do you not read the papers? Do you not hear of uprisings in\nGurla? I know you felt the sting of rebellion when Fatrasta rose up and\nthrew your armies out.”\n“Fools, all of them,” Nikslaus said.\nTamas persisted. “The world is changing. People do not exist to serve\ntheir governments or their kings. Governments exist to serve the people, so\nthe people should have a say in those governments.”\nNikslaus scoffed. “Impossible. Decisions should not be left to the\nrabble.”\n“One people should not be ruled by another,” Tamas said.\nNikslaus steepled his fingers. The gesture was often one of significance\nwhen a Privileged was involved—especially when he wore his gloves.\n“You’re either playing me, or you’re a naïve fool. You served in Gurla, in\nFatrasta, and half a dozen other savage countries where members of the\nNine have claimed land. As did I. The peasants and savages need to be\ntamed. As Adro and the powder mages need to be tamed.”\n“We learned two different things from our experiences, you and I,”\nTamas said.\nNikslaus wore a look that said he wasn’t that interested in hearing what\nTamas learned.\n“Who betrayed me?” Tamas asked. He had answers of his own to find.\nNikslaus gave him a glance. “Do you think I’d risk telling you?” He\nshook his head. “No. Perhaps when the guillotine blade is about to fall, I’ll\nwhisper it in your ear. Not a moment before that.”\nTamas opened his mouth, about to taunt Nikslaus with the knowledge\nthat Brigadier Barat was a traitor. He stopped himself. Was Nikslaus really\nworried he’d escape? Did he really think Tamas had a chance? Tamas was\nbereft of his abilities, his leg unusable. How could he possibly escape?\nNikslaus shifted in his seat. He moved the curtain enough to look out,\nthen sat back, an annoyed look on his face.\n“Are we being followed?” Tamas asked, his voice as casual as he could\nmake it.\n“You know,” Nikslaus said, ignoring Tamas’s question and glancing out\nthe window again, “many in the royal court are happy about your coup.”\n“I’m sure,” Tamas said. “If you take Adro, you’ll split the land we\nconfiscated from the nobility.”\n“Confiscated?” Nikslaus said. “Stole. Land and possessions will return\nto any living relations of the nobility. Titles will be restored. There will be a"

There will be a\ntax, but a hand of brotherhood must be extended to the ravished nobility.”\n“So Ipille is not as big a fool as I thought,” Tamas said. “Nor greedy.”\nNikslaus looked for a moment as if he’d strike Tamas. He seemed to\nthink better of it, simply raising his nose. “What mistake of breeding gave\nyou such disrespect for your betters? Such disdain for the God-chosen\nking?”\n“A god didn’t choose Ipille,” Tamas snorted. “Or that god is a fool.”\n“I draw the line at blasphemy,” Nikslaus said. “This conversation is\nover.”\nThe day drew on, morning giving way to afternoon and the carriage\ngrew very warm. Tamas loosened the collar on his sweat-stained riding\nshirt. His riding coat had been discarded for an inconspicuous brown\novercoat. It was hot and close in the tight quarters, and he wished Nikslaus\nwould open the window. The Privileged and the Warden alike seemed\nunaffected.\nHe could tell when they crossed the canal. The bridge was stone on\nsteel over a long, tall span, and the wagon wheels rolled over easily. They\nwere getting close to the harbor. He could smell it.\nNikslaus kept glancing out the window. Tamas wondered what Nikslaus\nsensed with his sorcery. Was Sabon on their trail? Or was Nikslaus simply\nnervous about their proximity to the city garrison? Tamas took a deep\nbreath and studied Nikslaus. Nervous? Yes. Near to panic? No, not even\nclose. And panic he would, if he thought any of the powder cabal were\ngetting close.\nTamas listened to the sounds outside the carriage, trying to place their\nlocation. Somewhere near the docks and the canal. If they had taken the\nRoan Bridge, they were very close indeed. They could take a smuggler boat\nout of any of the pier warehouses. Nikslaus wouldn’t wait for anything\nfancy. He’d want to be off with his prize as quickly as possible.\nThe carriage rolled to a stop. Nikslaus lifted the curtain and smiled at\nwhat he saw. Tamas’s heart fell. They were here.\nTamas didn’t know which startled him more: the explosion, or the\nscreaming horses that followed it. The whole carriage rocked, slamming\nTamas against his chains. He bit his tongue against a scream as his weight\n—and the weight of the Warden—threw his bad leg against the side of the\ncarriage.\nNikslaus kicked open the door. “Kill him if they take me,” he told the\nWarden as he leapt from the carriage. The echo of sorcery clapped the side\nof the carriage, shaking it more than the explosion had.\nTamas shared a glance with the Warden. The Warden positioned\nhimself in Nikslaus’s seat, drawing a knife.\nMore explosions followed. People screamed. Women and children’s\nvoices were mixed in. Tamas felt ill.

    "text": "More explosions followed. People screamed. Women and children’s\nvoices were mixed in. Tamas felt ill. People were dying out there.\nBystanders, caught out on their weekend errands by a crossfire made in the\npit. A volley of gunfire erupted, followed by the nearly inaudible pops of\nthe Wardens returning fire with air rifles. A bullet shattered the window and\nleft a hole in the other side of the carriage, passing right between Tamas and\nthe Warden. The Warden’s eyes grew just a little bit wider.\n“Clear the way!” Tamas heard the driver yell. “We’ll make a run for it.”\nTamas gritted his teeth. He wanted to strike, to reach out and wrestle the\nknife from the Warden’s hands. He’d have lost without powder, but at least\nhe’d have done something. With both hands and legs chained and his\nmagery gone, he could do nothing but sit and listen, grimacing when\nsorcery or explosions rocked the carriage.\nThey began to move suddenly. Whatever obstacle had obstructed the\nroad—probably a burning carriage, one filled with Wardens—was now\ngone. The driver whipped the horses into a frenzy, galloping down the\nstreet to the sound of yells. Gunfire and sorcery fell away behind them. The\ncarriage rocked violently. The Warden held on to the sides with both hands,\nsteadying himself without expression. Tamas jolted back and forth, unable\nto do the same in his chains, and listened to his own whimpers every time\nhis leg jolted.\nThe Warden watched out the window. “Almost there,” he said. He\nproduced a key, and despite the violent thrashing of the carriage, managed\nto unlock Tamas’s chains. He left the wrist and leg irons on. He brandished\nthe knife, and said in heavily accented Adran, “You give me any trouble\nand I’ll bury this in your chest.”\nThe carriage rolled to a stop. The driver leapt from his post, thumping to\nthe ground outside, and pulled the door open. The Warden turned to get out\nand froze.\nIt took just a split second for the Warden to turn on Tamas, knife at the\nready. Tamas caught the thrust between his wrists and used the leverage of\nhis irons to twist the blade away. Then he was on his back on the carriage\nbench, lights swimming before his eyes, his ears ringing. He barely even\nregistered the pain in his leg.\nIt took him a moment to climb to a sitting position. Every inch was an\neternity of agony. His leg screamed. He felt blood on the side of his face;\nhe’d not avoided the knife altogether after all. He braced himself against the\nside of the carriage, the smell of gunpowder in his nostrils.\nThe Warden was gone. There was a Warden-sized hole in the carriage,\nopposite the door. His body was on the ground outside, one leg still up on\nthe edge of the carriage, caught by a splinter of wood.\nTamas looked down as Olem deposited a hand cannon on the floor of\nthe carriage. He grunted from the weight, then looked up at Tamas. There\nwas relief in his eyes. “So I stole the right carriage,” he said.\nOlem helped Tamas out of the carriage. They were in an alleyway"

The strong smell of the sea and the sound of\nwaves said they were very close to the water. Adran soldiers filed into the\nalley within seconds. One tried to take Tamas’s weight from Olem. Olem\nwaved him off.\n“Where’s Sabon?” Tamas asked.\n“Chasing the Privileged, with Vlora,” Olem said. He sounded tired.\nCould he get tired? “The bastard cut and run when he saw how many of us\nthere were.”\nTamas’s eyes grew wide as more soldiers filed into the alley. There\nwere more in the streets. “You brought the whole garrison?”\n“As many as were close by,” Olem said.\n“How the pit did you find me?”\nOlem smiled. He glanced down, and for the first time Tamas noticed the\nhound sitting at his feet, eyes bigger than teacups looking up at him. His tail\nwagged. Tamas found he couldn’t speak. He leaned over, despite the pain,\nand patted Hrusch on the head.\n“That’s impossible,” he managed after a moment.\n“Sabon trained Hrusch to find you under any circumstances. Trained\nhim from birth, the damned pup. Had the help of an old farm witch north of\nthe university, a Knacked who can train animals. Hrusch can pick up your\nscent anywhere, even if you are in a sealed box in the middle of the sea.”\n“I never knew,” Tamas said.\n“It was his little secret. A backup plan,” Olem said. “I wish we’d never\nhad to use it.”\nTamas felt two days’ worth of fear, anger, and anticipation melt under\nOlem’s gaze. The bodyguard looked at him as a parent might at a child\nwho’d gone missing. Anger warred with relief in his eyes. Soldiers crowded\naround with words of concern. Tamas gave them all a grateful smile. After\na moment, he collapsed.\nChapter 27\nThe office on the top floor of the House of Nobles seemed old and familiar\nto Tamas, though he’d occupied it for only a couple of months. It seemed\nlike home, and he ran his fingers over the braided tassels at the edge of the\nsofa. His hands shook and he leaned heavily on a crutch. The room smelled\nof lemons. He wondered if it always had.\nOlem watched him from the doorway. Knacked or not, it turned out\nOlem did need rest. His eyes fluttered like one who longs for sleep, and\npurple bruises had formed under them. His normally neatly trimmed beard\nwas unruly, his hair a mess. On a regular day, Tamas might have chided\nhim for lax regulation.\nThis was not a regular day.\nI should tell him to get some rest. What was it Father used to tell me?\n“Rest is for the dead.”\n“Yes, sir,” Olem said.\nTamas glanced at him. “Hmm?”\n“You said, ‘Rest is for the dead,’” Olem said.\n“You look like the dead.”\n“Don’t look so good yourself, sir.” Olem struggled to put a smile on his"

Tamas could see worry in his eyes. “You should rest, sir,” Olem said.\n“It almost killed you getting up all those stairs.”\nOlem had insisted on helping Tamas up every step, half carrying him at\ntimes.\n“I don’t need a nurse,” Tamas said. “There’s work to be done.” He\nhobbled toward his desk, but halfway there he nearly fell.\nOlem was at his side in a moment, a hand under his elbow. “Sit down,\nsir,” he said. “Doctor Petrik will be here any minute.” Olem helped Tamas\nonto the sofa.\n“Bah,” Tamas said. He motioned to a chair. “Have a seat.”\n“I think I’ll stand, sir.”\n“Suit yourself.” Tamas couldn’t let Olem rest yet. He couldn’t let\nhimself rest yet. “I need to know how things went in my absence. How\nmany people know of my capture?”\n“Word spread quickly,” Olem said. “I’m afraid I had other things on my\nmind. I sent for Sabon as soon as I got back to the hunt, and grabbed\nHrusch.” He nodded to the hound, fast asleep in the corner. “Charlemund\ndid his best to keep things quiet. I wouldn’t be surprised if his priestesses\ntalked. I know Brigadier Sabastenien didn’t.”\n“So everyone made it away from Nikslaus safely?”\nOlem nodded. “I almost turned back when I heard the sorcery, sir,” he\nsaid. He refused to look Tamas in the eye. “If you need my stripes…”\n“Shut up,” Tamas said. “I won’t take your stripes.”\n“You gave me an order to see the others back to the hunt.”\n“I thought you had.”\n“Not quite, sir. I went on ahead, left the others to find their way back. I\nwouldn’t wait.”\n“Had I been in your position, I wouldn’t have followed that order. I\ncan’t fault a man for his instincts. Besides, you did your job. You did not\nturn back. Go on.” Tamas swallowed. He wanted nothing more than to lay\nhis head back and fall asleep, but things needed to be done first. He fought\nback exhaustion, pain, and nausea.\n“Word has spread of Ryze’s betrayal,” Olem said. “Lady Winceslav\nwants answers. Rumors are flying.”\n“Put a stop to them,” he said.\n“What?” Olem looked startled.\n“It’s not true.” Tamas struggled to get to his feet. Ryze was a good man.\nTamas wouldn’t let him take the blame for this. Olem put a hand on\nTamas’s shoulder, gently restraining him.\nOlem said, “I watched him take you off.”\n“You found the bodies, didn’t you?” Tamas asked.\nOlem slowly shook his head. “Blood, yes, but no bodies.”\n“That sorcery you heard as you left—that wasn’t me fighting back. That\nwas Ryze’s men holding off Duke Nikslaus so Ryze could warn me. Ryze\nwas cooked alive.”\n“Are you sure…?”"

I haven’t gone\nmad in an afternoon.”\n“If Ryze wanted to warn you, why did he go to all the trouble?” Olem\nsaid. “He could have just sent you a note or come to see you in person.”\nTamas rubbed his temples. “I don’t remember. I remember he was\nscared. Angry. Barat had something on him to keep him silent.”\n“Brigadier Barat? You hit your head pretty hard, from the look of that\nbump.” Olem gave him a weak smile.\n“Don’t be a fool.” Tamas struggled to get up again. His leg burned and\nhe broke into a hot sweat. He gave up. “Send a missive to Lady Winceslav.\nTell her Ryze is innocent of all accusations.” He paused. “Bring me\nBrigadiers Barat and Sabastenien.”\n“I’ll send a man,” Olem said, heading for the door.\n“No,” Tamas grunted. “Get them yourself. I don’t want either of them\nslipping away. Take a squad with you. And on second thought, don’t tell\nanyone about Ryze.”\n“But if he’s innocent…”\nTamas closed his eyes. He’d need strength for what lay ahead. “I’ll deal\nwith that later. Dismissed.”\n“Right away, sir.”\nAs soon as Olem was out the door, Tamas let out a gasp of pain. His leg\nhad stiffened up in just a few minutes. It throbbed when it didn’t hurt, and\nwhen the lances of pain worked their way up his leg each time he moved it,\nhe wished he’d let it throb. He ran a hand through his disheveled hair.\nTamas forced himself to think. Why had Ryze faked his kidnapping just\nto tell him about Barat? Tamas wished he had Adamat’s gift.\nHis son!\n“Olem!” he yelled. He waited a few moments. Olem didn’t return. He\nyelled again. A guard poked his head through the door. “What is it, sir?”\n“Kema, is Olem gone?”\nThe soldier nodded. “Took off just a minute ago. Looked like he was\ngoing to give someone the pit of a time.”\n“Hand me a pen and paper.”\nKema fetched a fountain pen and some stationery from Tamas’s desk\nand brought it over. Tamas sketched out a quick note. “Catch up with Olem.\nHave him do this before the other task.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nKema was gone again in a moment, leaving Tamas alone, when his leg\nbegan to throb again. A finger of black powder and he’d feel no pain… if\nhe could use it. He couldn’t even enter a powder trance with the gold star in\nhis leg.\n“Where’s Petrik, damn him?”\n“Right here.” The doctor closed the door quietly behind him. He carried\nhis medical bag in one hand, his coat over the other. He examined Tamas\nthrough a pair of spectacles."

    "text": "“Right here.” The doctor closed the door quietly behind him. He carried\nhis medical bag in one hand, his coat over the other. He examined Tamas\nthrough a pair of spectacles.\n“Pulled me away from a rather good game of bridge,” he said. He\nlooked peeved, but he usually did. The man had been drummed out of most\nof his postings as a public and private doctor because he completely lacked\na bedside manner. What he lacked, however, he made up for in brevity and\nskill.\n“My apologies,” Tamas said. “I’ll just suffer more, if you’d like to\nreturn to it.”\nDr. Petrik paused. He shrugged, and turned back to the door.\n“Have you no concept of sarcasm, you ancient bastard?”\nPetrik gave Tamas a long, annoyed look and came to his side. He\nwaddled like a man of twenty-five stone, though he was as thin as a rail. He\nsat down next to Tamas and removed his glasses. He examined Tamas’s\nface and head through a monocle.\n“Some light scratches,” he said after a moment. “Nothing to be\nconcerned about. Looks like you had a concussion.” He snapped his fingers\nin front of Tamas’s face, looked into each of his eyes. “You’re fine.” He\ntook Tamas’s leg—none too gently—and lifted it into his lap. He removed\nthe linen wrappings and gave it a clinical look.\n“You’ve seen a doctor already,” he said. There was an edge to his voice.\n“Yes,” Tamas said. “It was the physician with my captors. He’s the one\nwho put the leg back together.”\n“What did it look like before?”\n“I don’t know. I was out for the whole thing.”\n“Lucky. Looks like you shattered the whole leg. He did a good job,\nwhoever he was,” he said grudgingly.\n“I want you to take it apart.”\nPetrik blinked up at him. “Say that again?”\n“My leg. You need to take it apart.”\nPetrik set the leg down gently. “You hit your head harder than I\nthought.”\nWas that a hint of concern in Petrik’s voice? No, Tamas must have\nimagined it. “The surgeon inserted a gold sliver before he closed the\nwound.” Tamas paused, swallowed. Even saying it made him nauseous. “I\ncan’t use my magery.”\nDr. Petrik returned his spectacles to his face. He took them off, then put\nthem on again. He tucked one fist up under his chin, glaring at the leg.\n“You’re mad,” he said. “I won’t do it. If you leave it, a cyst will form. That\nshould close the gold away from your bloodstream and let you use your\npowers again.”\n“Do it,” Tamas said. “That’s an order.”\n“You think that’ll help? If the shock doesn’t kill you, you’ll lose your\nleg. Which might kill you anyway. You’re not thinking clearly.”\n“Nikslaus said the sliver was in the form of a star. Any time I move, it\nwill tear the tissue, letting the gold touch my blood again. I can feel it in\nthere, working its way around.”\nPetrik hesitated.\n“I appreciate your concern,” Tamas said."

I can feel it in\nthere, working its way around.”\nPetrik hesitated.\n“I appreciate your concern,” Tamas said.\n“Concern?” Petrik said. “Yes, for myself. You know what your lackeys\nwill do to me if you die during the procedure? I saw Olem on his way out of\nhere. I’m not an idiot. You sent him away so he couldn’t protest, and Sabon\nisn’t back yet. They’d tear me apart.”\n“Who’d tear you apart?”\nSabon stood in the doorway, paused in the midst of unbuttoning his\njacket. The jacket was covered in powder stains, dirt, and burns. It looked\nlike he’d been in a coal mine. He hung it on a peg in the corner. A single\ncut ran the length of his cheek, the blood already dry, and his hands were\ndirty and smudged.\n“Did you catch him?” Tamas said.\nSabon shook his head. “I’m sorry.”\nTamas bit back a rebuke. Shit. “How’d he get away?”\n“A well-rehearsed route,” Sabon said. “Into a warehouse with a false\nfloor, and down into the sewers. Our men are scouring sewer exits, but I’ll\nbe surprised if they find him. Vlora is still tracking him, but he could come\nout anywhere in Adopest. It’s as if he expected us to catch up with them.”\nSabon made a disgusted noise in the back of his throat. He stepped over and\ngave Tamas’s leg a look-over. “You’ve had better days,” he said.\n“Right. I have.”\n“Will he lose the leg?” Sabon asked Dr. Petrik.\nThe doctor ignored Tamas’s look of warning. “He might,” he said, “if\nhe has me open it up, like he wants.”\n“Why?” Sabon looked to Tamas for an explanation.\nTamas took a deep breath. “Nikslaus’s physician fixed the leg. Before\nhe did, he inserted a golden sliver right up against the bone. It’s star-shaped,\nto prevent a cyst from forming.”\nSabon’s eyes widened. “The beast,” he snarled. “I’ll take off his hands\nwhen I catch him.”\nTamas couldn’t disagree with the sentiment. “If we ever catch him,” he\nsaid. “Petrik, I want the surgery.”\nThe doctor gave Sabon a long look.\n“No,” Sabon said. “If you die, the whole campaign will be at risk.”\nThe campaign, Sabon had said. Tamas almost smiled. Sabon would\nnever admit to being concerned.\n“We just got you back,” Sabon said.\n“I won’t go on without my magery,” Tamas said. “Petrik, what are the\nrisks if I don’t have you take it out?”\nThe old doctor frowned. “If what you say is true, you’ll be in constant\npain. You won’t sleep, and the exhaustion will keep your body from healing\nnaturally.” He didn’t look happy. “We should take it out.”\nSabon looked from Tamas to the doctor, then sniffed. “Good luck,” he\nsaid, leaving the room.\n“You wanted to see me?” Adamat shifted from one foot to the other and"

Surgery had\nalways made him nervous. Too many things could go wrong and it seemed\nlike every year doctors were coming up with a new and painful way to kill\nyou under the guise of medicine. It was an irrational thought and he knew\nit. The statistics supported the opposite. The ancient practice of bloodletting\nwas becoming more unpopular, while recent ideas about sterilization had\nbegun to spread in the medical field. Survival rates were higher than they’d\nbeen since the Time of Kresimir.\nThe field marshal sat on the edge of an operating table, an impromptu\nsurgery set up in a side room in the House of Nobles. He wore nothing but a\ntowel around his waist and Adamat was amazed at the number of old scars\ncrisscrossing Tamas’s chest. Some were from swords, one that looked like a\nknife wound, and three pink, faded welts from bullet wounds. He had a\nbump on his head visible even under his graying hair, and his right leg was\nred and swollen. To one side, a doctor in a white coat examined his\ninstruments with care.\nSo Tamas was alive, though the worse for wear. The gossip columns\nwould kill to find out what happened over on Palo Street yesterday and\nwhere Tamas had been the two days prior. Adamat decided not to ask.\nTamas nodded. “Have you found my traitor?”\n“No, sir.”\n“Why not?”\n“Not to offer excuses, but I’m doing the work of twenty men.”\n“We’re paying you well, are we not?”\n“Not exactly, and pay doesn’t make the work go any faster. I have\ninterviews and research to conduct and a great deal of traveling.”\n“ ‘Not exactly’?”\n“I’m investigating the reeve, sir. I’m not going to interrogate him and\nthen ask for a check.”\nTamas snorted. “Olem, see that the good investigator gets paid.”\nThe bodyguard in the corner paused his pacing long enough to give a\nbrisk nod.\n“Surely you have suspicions?”\n“Always,” Adamat said. “But no hard proof.”\n“I have here a letter,” Tamas said, gesturing to his desk, “from my son\nTaniel. He is at Shouldercrown with the Mountainwatch, helping fend off\nthe Kez attack. It seems he and Privileged Borbador are in agreement that a\npowerful sorceress has joined the Kez side and seeks to lead the Kez Cabal\nthrough the fortress and up to Kresim Kurga, where they will attempt to\nsummon Kresimir.”\nAdamat felt his mouth hanging open. “That’s absurd.”\n“Quite,” Tamas said. “Men under siege can often lose perspective.\nWhat’s more, my son is not well.” Tamas did not elaborate on this. “Yet I\nam forced to make contingencies. The Kez may have developed a new\nweapon or…” He glanced out the window and grimaced. “This business\nabout Kresimir’s Promise… did you find out anything else about it in your\nresearch?

    "text": "about Kresimir’s Promise… did you find out anything else about it in your\nresearch? Anything to indicate that Kresimir needed to be summoned, or in\nwhat manner he would try to seek revenge for his dead king?”\nAdamat said, “No. As I told you, my research came up with nothing.\nPassages were ripped completely from the books, expunged by someone\nwho didn’t want this information known.” This alone had troubled Adamat\nfrom the beginning. But he was not one to speculate. “My knowledge of\nKresimir’s Promise comes from Privileged Borbador alone.”\n“That is unfortunate.” Tamas touched a hand to his forehead and swayed\nslightly. He was not well. “I hesitate to give in to hysteria, but I must guard\nagainst the possibility that there is some truth to it. Bah! Summoning gods.\nWho thinks of such things? I have sent the fourth brigade to Shouldercrown.\nThat should be more than enough to hold the pass against the Kez.” He made a\ndismissive gesture. “I am sorry I interrupted your investigation, Inspector. I\ndid want to tell you one thing before you go.”\n“Sir?”\n“If I do not survive this surgery, or my recovery goes badly, I want you\nto continue your investigation.”\nAdamat felt a thrill of fear. “With all due respect, sir, I’d be dead in a\nditch within hours. I suspect only fear of suspicion keeps me from falling\nprey to assassins. Fear of you, to be precise.”\n“You will have a guard,” Tamas said. “If I am dead, justice will be\nserved not from a trial but from cold steel. The seventh brigade will assist\nyou with some glee, I suspect.”\nTamas really thought he might die. Adamat’s fear deepened. If Tamas\ndied, everything would fall apart. Especially with such contingency. The\narmy would go after the rest of the councillors; every man would be for\nhimself. Chaos would descend upon the country. There would be no\nwinners. And if he lived, Adamat would be forced to continue to betray\nhim, telling all to Lord Vetas. Where had his integrity gone? For the\nhundredth time, Adamat weighed the risks of telling Tamas all and asking\nfor his help. No, he decided again. His family’s safety was more important\nthan integrity or honor.\nAdamat’s thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of a tall, fat man with\nlong black hair tucked back in a ponytail behind him. He carried himself\nlike a king, though he wore the apron and tall hat of a chef. He held a silver\ntray above his head and a ladle big enough to brain in a man’s head hung\nfrom his apron.\nTamas regarded him with some wariness. “Mihali?”\n“Field Marshal,” Mihali said. “I’ve brought you a broth to drink before\nyour surgery. It will aid in your recovery, I think.”\nThe doctor scowled at Mihali. “No food or drink,” he said.\n“I insist!” Mihali held the tray out for Tamas.\n“Absolutely not. Food or drink can cause complications during the\nsurgery, I…”\nTamas waved the doctor off. “I think I will manage,” Tamas said. “You\naren’t even giving me ether.”"

Adamat recognized the arch-diocel by the robes\nhe wore, if not by his face. Charlemund was a man with a fearsome\nreputation, and he did not give many public sermons. He was not well liked\namong the lower classes, as arch-diocels went.\n“Tamas,” Charlemund said. “I am glad to see you alive and safe, but\nI’ve come on business. My men say your soldiers will not give up this\nblasphemous cook of yours. There was some kind of scuffle yesterday\nwhen my guard tried to come for him…”\nHe paused, a frown crossing his face when he saw Mihali, Adamat, and\nthe rest.\n“Surely Mihali is of little import,” Tamas said.\n“If it were my choice, I would leave him in your hands. What is a mad\ncook to me? Yet arch-diocels more zealous in the faith than I are\ndemanding his arrest. They are putting pressure on me, Tamas. They are\nthreatening the Church’s neutrality.”\n“You’ll have my decision later,” Tamas said.\n“I must insist that it be now.” Charlemund squared his shoulders. His\ngaze fell on Mihali. “You are he, are you not? The blasphemous cook?”\nMihali set the platter down gently beside Tamas and turned to\nCharlemund. He took a deep breath, sucking in his enormous gut. “I am a\nchef, sir, and you will speak to me as such.”\n“A chef! Ha!” Charlemund threw his head back and laughed. His hand\nwent to the hilt of his smallsword. “Tamas, I arrest this man in the name of\nthe Church.”\n“Get out.”\nThe words were quiet, yet Adamat felt as if all warmth had been sucked\nfrom the room. He turned to Tamas, but it wasn’t Tamas who had spoken. It\nhad been the chef.\n“How dare you.” Charlemund drew a handspan of steel.\n“Get out!” Mihali bellowed. His ladle appeared in his hand, for all the\nworld like he was holding a sword. The large end pointed steadily at\nCharlemund’s nose. “I will not have you here. You false priest, you\nabhorrent fool! Give me a reason and I will strike you down!”\nCharlemund’s face contorted with rage. “What kind of madness is this?\nI arrest you in the name of the Church! I don’t fear your ladle, you ungodly\nglutton!”\nMihali advanced suddenly upon Charlemund. The arch-diocel\nbackpedaled a few steps, drew his sword, and lunged. Mihali caught the\nblade with his ladle, swung it expertly to one side, and backhanded\nCharlemund hard enough to throw him over the sofa.\nThe room was silent. Olem rushed to Charlemund’s side.\n“Did you just kill the arch-diocel?” Adamat asked."

Olem rushed to Charlemund’s side.\n“Did you just kill the arch-diocel?” Adamat asked.\nMihali sniffed. “I should have,” he said. “Drink your broth, Field\nMarshal.” He left the room without another word.\n“He’s alive, sir,” Olem said. “Unconscious.”\nAdamat exchanged a glance with Tamas. He could see his own disbelief\nreflected in Tamas’s eyes. The field marshal held his leg in pain. “Olem,\nsee that the arch-diocel is put in a room downstairs. Let it be known he had\na bad fall down the stairs. Find witnesses. Inspector, I’m sure you saw it.”\nAdamat smoothed the front of his jacket. “It was a very nasty fall. He\ntumbled two flights before we could catch him.”\n“I believe that was the case,” Tamas said. “Doctor, what could you\nprescribe for Charlemund?”\nThe doctor looked down his nose at the unconscious form of the arch-\ndiocel. “Arsenic?”\n“Now, really. Something to give him a quality headache and a great\ndeal of memory loss.”\n“Cyanide.”\n“Doctor!”\n“I’ll find something,” the doctor mumbled.\n“Olem.”\nOlem paused, his arms beneath Charlemund’s shoulders as he dragged\nhim from the room. “Sir?”\n“What was that bit about the men scuffling with Charlemund’s guards?”\n“I was going to tell you sir, after the surgery.”\n“I’m sure you were. What happened?”\nOlem paused with his hands under Charlemund’s arms. “Just that, sir.\nThe boys don’t want to lose Mihali. Say he’s a good-luck charm, cooking or\nnot. I had nothing to do with it. At least, not too much.”\n“How the pit is he a good-luck charm? What has he done to warrant\nthat?”\n“Filled their bellies,” Olem said.\n“Were there any casualties?”\n“There might be next time.” A cloud passed across Olem’s face.\n“And if I give a direct order?”\nOlem looked down. “I’m sure the men will follow it, sir.”\nTamas closed his eyes and rubbed them. “What do you suggest,\nInspector?”\nAdamat started. “I’m not sure I know enough details, sir.” He felt like a\nfly on the wall here. This was not an event he was meant to witness. This\nMihali character—Adamat would need to find out more about him.\n“Pretend you do,” Tamas insisted.\n“It’s a poor commander who gives in to the whims of his troops,”\nAdamat said. “And an even worse one who ignores their wants and needs.\nYet there are mitigating factors.” He jerked his head toward the arch-diocel,\nwhom Olem had resumed dragging out the door.\n“Olem.”\nThe bodyguard paused once more. “He’s coming around, sir.”\n“I’d rather he not yet.”\nThere was a sound like a hammer hitting meat. “He won’t.”\nTamas put his head in his hands. “Let it be known that Mihali has been\nconscripted by the seventh brigade of the Adran army.

Send a note to\nHassenbur, letting them know they may send a doctor to watch over him.\nWe will cover all expenses, and Claremonte will be spared any\nembarrassment.”\n“And the Church?”\nTamas sighed. “They can send a priest to talk to him, if they like. To\nconvert him or some such nonsense.”\n“So Mihali is the legion’s official cook now, eh?”\n“Chef.”\n“Right, sir. Thank you, sir.”\nTamas waited until the soldier was gone to begin eating his broth. A\nfew moments passed, the only sound that of his satisfied slurping. He\nlooked up. “Inspector?”\n“Yes?” Adamat had found his mind wandering again.\n“You’re dismissed.”\nAs Adamat left the room, he heard Tamas say, “Let’s get on with this,\nPetrik.”\nHe paused in the hallway. Tamas handled that well enough. The field\nmarshal was not a man to tolerate fools questioning his orders. He was not a\ngood man to cross. Adamat wondered again if he should tell Tamas about\nLord Vetas. If Tamas discovered Adamat’s betrayal on his own, Adamat\nwould lose any chance of rescuing his family. But if Adamat attempted a\nrescue, even with the help of Tamas’s soldiers, his family might die. The\nrisk was just too great.\nChapter 28\nCome on, you idiot,” Tamas said. “Prop me up. Put the pillow there.” He\npaused and gripped the edge of his desk as the room spun around him.\n“Sir?” Olem said. He chewed on the end of his cigarette.\n“I’m fine. Go on.”\nOlem wedged a cushion between Tamas and his chair.\n“Down farther,” Tamas said. “Perfect. Turn the chair a little. I want to\nlook casual.”\nTamas gave a few more orders until he was satisfied. He sat behind his\ndesk, pointed toward the office door, his back propped up straight so he\nlooked taller. Olem stepped back.\n“Do I look like an invalid?” Tamas asked.\n“No.”\n“You hesitated.”\n“A little beat up, sir,” Olem said. “It’ll do.”\n“Good.” Tamas didn’t dare lean forward, hardly even to look down, so\nhe felt blindly to a desk drawer and removed a powder cartridge. He broke\nthe end with his thumbnail and poured it out on his tongue. He fought off a\nbout of dizziness, then darkness as his consciousness tried to retreat before\nthe wave of awareness that flooded his senses. The taste was sulfuric, bitter.\nTo Tamas it tasted of ambrosia.\nHis exhaustion ebbed. The pain in his leg receded to a steady hum in the\nback of his mind, a simple reminder that his leg had been cut open, the flesh\ntorn and the bone reset but without the agony that should accompany it.\n“Three capsules in an hour, sir?” There was a hint of worry in Olem’s\nvoice.\n“Save it for someone else,” Tamas grunted. “I’ve no time to worry\nabout going powder blind.” Truth be told, he admitted to himself, the"

He needed it, longed for its\nstrongest embrace like a long-absent lover. He would deal with signs of\naddiction later. For now, there were more important matters. Despite the\npowder trance, one of the deepest he’d ever been in, he could barely move.\nHis body still felt the pain, still cried out over his lack of rest—his brain\nsimply did not register it.\n“Tell me about Brigadier Sabastenien,” Tamas said.\n“He was an orphan,” Olem said, “adopted into the Wings of Adom as a\nbullet-boy. The Wings of Adom are his family—Adro his mother, the army\nhis father.”\n“As I’ve heard as well.”\n“He helped me track you,” Olem said. “Ryze’s betrayal burned him\ndeep.”\n“Does he know Ryze is dead?” Tamas asked.\nOlem shook his head.\n“And you didn’t say a word of Ryze’s innocence?”\n“Not one, sir,” Olem said.\n“Good. Send him in.”\nBrigadier Sabastenien was one of the youngest commanders of the\nWings of Adom, barely twenty-five years old. Tamas knew that brigadiers\nwere not elected at whim. They were quick, they were intelligent, brave,\nand fanatically loyal to the Winceslav family and to Adro. Or they had\nbeen, until Brigadier Barat.\nBrigadier Sabastenien was a shorter man, with dark, unruly hair cut just\nabove his eyes. He had grown muttonchops to give him a better appearance\nof maturity, and wore them better than most men of his age.\n“I’m glad to see you back in good health, sir,” Sabastenien said.\n“Thank you,” Tamas said. “I understand you helped Olem track me.”\nTamas nodded to his bodyguard, and then dismissed him with a jerk of his\nhead. Olem slipped out onto the balcony, while Tamas’s head reeled from\nthe sudden movement. Careful, he reminded himself.\n“I provided what service I could,” the brigadier said. “Pray tell me if\nthere is more I can do. I’ve already begun gathering men to hunt Brigadier\nRyze with Lady Winceslav’s blessing. He’ll not escape.”\n“There is one thing you can do,” Tamas said.\n“Anything, sir.”\n“It’s a small thing. You see that screen there?” Tamas pointed toward\nthe corner of the room, where a divider stood of the type a man or woman\nmight change behind. “I’d like you to stand behind it and listen.”\n“Sir?” Sabastenien said.\n“You’ll understand soon enough,” Tamas said. “Please. For the whim of\na beat up old man.”\n‑\nBrigadier Sabastenien gave him a hesitant nod. “Now?”\nTamas glanced at the clock. “Yes, that would be about right.”\nSabastenien positioned himself behind the curtain.

His mind, though blocked off\nfrom the pain and weariness that would have rendered a man unconscious,\nstill spun from the powder trance. Eyes open, he could see Olem out on the\nbalcony, watching the birds fly in the sun over Elections Square. He could\nsee stray fibers on Olem’s jacket, and when he concentrated, he thought he\ncould even hear the beat of Sabastenien’s heart from where he hid behind\nthe curtain. The young brigadier was calm.\nA knock sounded at the door.\n“Come in,” Tamas said. He straightened in his seat. Now was not a time\nto appear weak.\nThe door opened and Tamas caught a glimpse of Vlora waiting in the\nhall, hands resting on the butts of her pistols, as a pair of soldiers brought in\nBrigadier Barat. In contrast to Sabastenien, Barat was a tall man, taller than\nmost. His features sharp, his brow severe, though with enough softness in\nthe cheeks and eyes as to remain quite handsome. He was clean-shaven, and\nTamas had heard soldiers say the man could not grow a beard if he wanted.\nBarat was twenty-six, and his father had been a wealthy viscount in the\nnorth before his death years before.\nTamas did not miss the look of confidence on Barat’s face, nor the\nsword still buckled to his belt.\n“Please, sit,” Tamas said, indicating one of the chairs on the other side\nof his desk.\n“I prefer to stand, thank you,” Brigadier Barat said. “I hope there’s a\nreason I was escorted here by your soldiers. Perhaps there’s been some\nmisunderstanding.”\n“I’m certain that’s the case,” Tamas said. “Give me just some of your\ntime.” He fell quiet, watching Barat, waiting for him to squirm. A minute or\ntwo passed.\n“This is quite irregular, sir,” Brigadier Barat said.\n“Forgive me,” Tamas said. “My adventure over the past few days had\nquite the effect on me. I’m just thinking…”\n“About what, sir?”\n“You’ve heard of Ryze’s betrayal?” Tamas said.\nBrigadier Barat stiffened. “A disgrace for the Wings of Adom. I’m very\nrelieved you’re all right, sir,” he added, as if an afterthought.\n“Thank you.” Tamas smiled shallowly. “Do you know why Ryze\nbetrayed us?”\n“He was a broken man, sir,” Barat said. “Old and brittle.”\nTamas feigned surprise. “Really? I can’t say that we were ever really\nfriends, but Ryze was a contemporary of mine. He was a few years ahead at\nthe university, and the academy. He never loved anything the way he’s\nloved Adro, and he was a fine commander and father. He handled the\ncampaign against the royalists splendidly.”\n“That was only my impression of him, sir,” Barat said. “I mean, I’ve\nonly known him for a year or so. I meant no offense.”\n“Why was he ‘brittle and broken’?” Tamas asked.\n“I don’t know. He…”\n“Yes?”"

He…”\n“Yes?”\n“Well, I don’t want to start rumors, sir, not without all the facts in.”\n“It’s a bit late for that,” Tamas said. “Ryze handed me over to a Kez\nPrivileged. He’s a traitor and a villain.”\nBarat looked slightly shaken by this. He licked his lips. “Well, I think he\ndidn’t like me. He was jealous of my favor with Lady Winceslav. He didn’t\nthink one so young should have risen the ranks to brigadier so quickly.”\n“Really?” Tamas once again acted surprised. “I… well, I can’t imagine.\nI know Brigadier Sabastenien rose faster than you. And he wasn’t bedding\nLady Winceslav.”\n“Well, yes but…” Brigadier Barat’s eyes grew large. “Sir! With respect,\nsir, I’ll have to ask you to take that back.”\n“We both know it’s true,” Tamas said. “In fact, it’s common knowledge\naround both my army and the Wings of Adom.” It wasn’t, but Barat didn’t\nneed to know that. Tamas heard Sabastenien shift behind the curtain. Barat\nglanced that way for a moment. Tamas called back his attention with a\ncough.\n“I will call you out if I have to, sir,” Barat said. “To protect my honor,\nand the Lady’s.”\n“Call out a powder mage?” Tamas said. “You’d really do that?”\nA small smile formed at the corners of Barat’s mouth. “Yes,” he said.\n“And I’d beg you to choose pistols, even if it meant my death. To prove my\nhonor.”\nBarat knew about the star in Tamas’s leg, or he wouldn’t be so cavalier\nabout a duel. He was also grandstanding. He knew he was being watched.\n“Where’s Ryze’s son?” Tamas asked.\nBrigadier Barat was taken off guard. “What? How should I know?”\n“I’m sorry,” Tamas said. “My mind is slipping. I already know. His\nbody was recovered from the canal this afternoon. There were weights on\nhis ankles. He was garroted so cruelly that his head fell off when they\nbrought the body up. Sad, an eighteen-year-old boy with such promise,\nmeeting an end like that. You know, that’s another thing both Ryze and I\nshared. We both married late in life, and were gifted with just one son\nbefore our wives passed.” Tamas thought of Taniel and wondered briefly\nhow the battle was going at South Pike. He wondered what he’d do if\nsomeone took his son hostage. He blinked, his vision blurred for a moment,\nand fought down his rage. This was best done coldly.\n“A tragedy,” Brigadier Barat said, his voice on edge.\nTamas said, “A witness at Adopest University saw a man matching your\ndescription enter the dormitories late last night. One of his classmates said\nthe boy went with the same man.”\n“Impossible,” Brigadier Barat snarled. “No investigation could go on so\nquickly…” Barat stopped, sensing the trap. “I hope his killer is caught and"

That still doesn’t excuse what his father did.”\n“Piano wire is often used as a garrote,” Tamas said. “Those with little\nexperience tend to cut their own fingers. May I see your hands?”\nBarat clasped his hands behind his back and took a step back from\nTamas’s desk.\nTamas took a deep breath. Loudly, calmly, he said, “His father warned\nme of a traitor among the brigadiers. He warned me that his son was a\nveritable hostage, and begged me to protect him. He didn’t care that his\nown life was forfeit when the sorcerer caught up to us. Ryze was no traitor,\nBarat. He was a patriot. A hero. And he warned me about you.”\n“What rubbish is this?” Brigadier Barat hissed. “You’ve gone mad.”\n“Sometimes I think that would be simpler,” Tamas said. “Who is the\ntraitor in the council? Things will go easier for you if you tell me.”\n“Go to the pit,” Barat scoffed. “You have no evidence, old man. I won’t\nplay this game with you.” He spun on his heel, heading for the door. The\ndoor rattled, but did not open. “Why is this locked?” Barat glanced\nnervously toward the balcony. Olem watched the scene through the\nwindow, a rifle in his hands.\nBarat spun on Tamas. “Who the pit do you think you are? Lady\nWinceslav will not stand for this! What do you think you’ll do? Bring me to\njustice? Send me to court? The Lady will protect me. I’ll never see a cell,\nand you will only disgrace yourself in the process. False accusations from a\nbitter, broken man,” Barat said. His smile grew. “Just like Ryze! Filled with\nlies and delusions, a traitor to his own country. You’re not even a powder\nmage anymore.”\nTamas sniffed. He reached into his breast pocket and removed a bullet.\nHe held it up, rolled it between his fingers. In the other hand he held up a\npowder cartridge. “Am I not?” He shook his head. “Alas, this is not mine to\ndeal with, no matter how much I’d like to.” He lowered his hands. Loudly,\nhe said, “There’s a pistol underneath the divan cushion. It’s loaded.”\n“What?” Barat demanded. He drew his sword and stepped toward\nTamas.\nBrigadier Sabastenien emerged from behind the curtain. He held the\npistol up and pulled back the hammer. His hand was firm.\nThe shot echoed through the room, sending Tamas’s head spinning. He\ngripped the desk until the dizziness was gone, then lifted his head to look at\nthe body as Olem stepped into the room.\nBrigadier Barat lay on the floor, his blood and brains scattered across\nthe sofa and the curtain.

His hands shook a little as he tossed the\npistol to the floor, and he stumbled over to the sofa. “I believed Ryze was a\ntraitor,” he said after a moment. His voice was agonized, his face contorted\nby sorrow.\n“He was a good man,” Tamas said.\n“His son…”\n“Dead,” Tamas said. “Olem, I want Ryze’s remains found. He was hit\nby sorcery, so there won’t be much left. Scour the King’s Wood if you have\nto. I want him buried along with his son, next to his wife, with state\nhonors.”\n“Of course,” Olem said quietly.\n“What do I tell the Lady?” Sabastenien said. He was stricken. Tamas\nsaw him for the youth he was then, and pitied him.\n“You shot him in my defense,” Tamas said softly. “I’ll not allow a\ncourt-martial.”\n“I killed Lady Winceslav’s lover, a fellow brigadier,” Sabastenien said.\nHis voice shook. “I’ll be drummed out of the Wings with dishonor, no\nmatter the reason.” He paused. “May I go?”\n“Of course. You’ll always have a place in my army,” he said. When the\nyoung brigadier had left, Tamas said to Olem, “Have someone keep an eye\non him.”\nOlem frowned. “He heard it all. He did the right thing. Why should he\ncare if they kick him out of the Wings? The army is certainly a pay cut,\nbut…”\n“The Wings aren’t just mercenaries, Olem,” Tamas said. His weariness\nwas breaking through the powder trance, the pain beginning to bleed into\nhis defenses. “The Wings are a life. A brotherhood. To kill one of their own\nis the worst of crimes. Even for treason, when they handle it among\nthemselves, the executioner is protected, unknown, so that his brothers will\nnot find out and alienate him. Sabastenien’s career with the Wings is over.”\nOlem turned his frown on Tamas. “Then, why…?”\nTamas sighed. He brought out another powder charge, longed to\nsprinkle the powder on his tongue. He put it back in his shirt pocket.\n“You’ll think me cruel,” he said. “I need Sabastenien on the lines. If he\nsurvives this war, he’ll be a general at thirty.” He ignored Olem’s look of\ndisapproval. “Have someone ready to offer him a job when he’s been\ndrummed out. Full commander.”\nTamas leaned over his chair, head light, and vomited on the floor. He\ndragged his sleeve across his mouth and looked up at Olem’s worried gaze.\n“I think I’ll rest for a while now.”\nOlem went to fetch a janitor. Tamas leaned back in his chair, tasting\nbile.

She\nknew he could kill casually. She’d seen him gun down Bystre in the streets\nwithout a second look.\n“Olem, I…” The field marshal leveraged himself around his dressing\nscreen and stopped when he saw Nila. “I’m sorry,” he said. “Didn’t realize\nthey’d sent someone up to clean up the mess already.”\nMess, he called it. As if the bits of brain and skull and all the blood\nwere nothing more than the leftovers from dinner.\n“My apologies, sir,” Nila said with a curtsy. “I was just told to come get\nyour uniform.”\n“Of course. The laundress. Olem! Help me get this uniform off.”\nOlem came through the front door, rolling a cigarette between his\nfingers. He smiled at Nila before heading behind the dressing screen.\n“Damned blood got everywhere,” the field marshal said.\n“That’s what happens, sir.”\n“Ow. Son of a… be more careful!”\n“So sorry, sir.”\n“Damn my leg!”\n“There’s a lady present, sir.”\nThe field marshal’s curses lowered to a grumble for a few moments.\nOlem reappeared a moment later with the field marshal’s uniform tucked\nunder his arm and gave it over to Nila. The bearded sergeant looked\ndifferent from that night when Adran soldiers had stormed the Eldaminse\ntownhouse. A touch of gray had entered his beard; worry lines at the corner\nof his eyes were etched a little deeper. Nila had seen him around the House\nof Nobles, but he’d shown no recognition of her.\n“Think you could wash the curtains, too?” Olem asked. “Who knows\nwhen they’ll send up someone to get to the upholstery?”\n“Of course,” Nila said.\nField Marshal Tamas limped out from behind the dressing screen and\nover to his desk. He wore a white shirt and blue soldier’s pants. His face\nwas white and bloodless from his ordeals. Nila wondered what that face\nwould look like after she’d strangled him in his sleep.\nOlem removed the curtains from the windows and gathered them all up\nin his arms. “Sir,” he said, “I’ll help her downstairs with these and be right\nback up.”\n“Take your time,” the field marshal said, waving him off. “Charlemund\nhas sent me some idiotic church decree that must be read by supper.”\n“I can take them,” Nila said when they reached the hallway.\nOlem tucked the curtains under one arm. “I don’t mind. The field\nmarshal demands time alone now and then.”\n“Aren’t you his bodyguard?”\n“His manservant, more like,” he said without bitterness. “We’ve tripled\nthe guard on the top floor. Anything that can get through the rest of the\nboys watching his back would have no trouble with me. Cigarette?”\nNila studied Olem out of the corner of her eye as they went down the\nstairs. “Thank you,” she said, taking the offered cigarette. He began rolling\nanother one immediately."

He began rolling\nanother one immediately.\n“You don’t seem the shy type,” Olem said. “But the boys say you don’t\ntalk much.”\nCold fear seized Nila’s belly. Why would Field Marshal Tamas’s\nbodyguard be asking after her? “I keep to myself, mostly,” she said evenly.\n“That’s what I heard.” He let the conversation lapse for a moment, then,\n“I didn’t think I’d see you again after that night.”\nNila’s heart jumped. He remembered her? She didn’t want to be\nremembered. She didn’t want to be recognized. If he knew who she was,\nmaybe he had figured out it was her who’d smuggled Jakob out of the\ntownhouse.\n“Oh?” she said when she’d found her voice.\n“You seem better suited here than scrubbing livery for some lord,”\nOlem said. “I like your dress. Better than what you were wearing before.”\nNila tried to picture her uniform under Duke Eldaminse. She found she\ncouldn’t even remember what it looked like. She needed to turn the\nconversation away from herself. She didn’t need him asking questions.\n“You were wearing something different, too,” she said.\nOlem fingered the captain’s pin at his lapel. “The field marshal said his\nbodyguard couldn’t be less than a captain.” He shrugged. “I’m not much of\nan officer. Never liked them much, myself. I’ll take the pay that comes with\nit, though.”\nOlem removed his cigarette, switched it to his other hand, and put it\nback in his mouth. He stopped suddenly, forcing her to turn around. “Would\nyou like to see a play tonight?” he asked.\nNila blinked. A play? So he wasn’t interested in her in his capacity as\nField Marshal Tamas’s bodyguard. She couldn’t help the relieved grin that\nspread across her face.\nOlem seemed to take that as a yes. “The field marshal insisted I take the\nnight off. Not many better ways to spend it than with a beautiful woman.”\n“I’d be honored.” She gave him a little curtsy and what she hoped was\nher best shy smile.\nThey reached the laundry rooms beneath the House of Nobles and Olem\nleft her. She looked through her supplies to find something that would get\nthe blood out of the curtains and the field marshal’s uniform. As she\nscrubbed at the stains, she reminded herself that she was here to kill Tamas.\nShe wouldn’t let Olem stop her or distract her. He seemed a good man, but\nhe served an evil master. Tamas had to die before he could get more blood\non his uniform. He’d killed men, women. Even innocent children. He had to\nbe stopped.\nOlem mentioned he wasn’t the field marshal’s only guard. If she killed\nTamas sometime when Olem was off duty, then he wouldn’t be blamed by\nthe failure. Yes, that would be best. She scrubbed harder at the stains.\nChapter 29\nTaniel listened to the sound of hoofbeats steadily climb the mountainside.\nHe leaned on his rifle and took a sniff of powder. He’d been watching the\nrider’s approach since the sun began to set over the mountains behind him."

He’d been watching the\nrider’s approach since the sun began to set over the mountains behind him.\nThe rider was coming up from the Kez advance base. He rode under a white\nflag of truce.\nA messenger.\n“Go get Gavril,” Taniel told Fesnik. The young watcher squinted into\nthe dusk and nodded, heading back into the town. Fesnik had drawn lots for\nthe evening watch. Taniel had given him some company, mostly for an\nexcuse to see the engineers and masons at work as they repaired the bastion.\nFesnik’s watch would be over when the last light disappeared from the\nsky. Taniel would go in then, and was looking forward to a long night’s\nsleep. If fate was kind, this messenger would say the Kez were pulling\nback.\nThe mountains were quiet. Only intermittent sounds drifted up from the\nmassive Kez army below. They weren’t preparing for a push this night, nor\nany night for the last week. The battle for the bastion had weakened both\nsides, and they’d spent a week gathering bodies, restocking ammunition and\nsupplies, and trying to get a little rest.\nThe quiet of the Kez camp made Taniel nervous.\nTaniel turned at the sound of footsteps on stone behind him. It was\nMozes, musket on his shoulder.\n“I’ve got the night watch,” he said.\nTaniel stretched. “You can have it.”\nMozes was a quiet man, not often in for a long conversation, but a good\ndrinking companion. They’d spent plenty of hours together at the Howling\nWendigo over the last week.\nTaniel remained at the bastion wall for a few more minutes. Long\nenough to watch the rider approach the gates and be admitted and a small\ngroup emerge from the town to meet the messenger. The group was led by\nGavril, his large silhouette immediately recognizable. The conversation was\nshort, and the rider was soon heading back through the gate.\nTaniel nodded farewell to Mozes and headed toward Gavril.\nThe group was in a quiet conference when Taniel arrived. All heads\nturned toward him.\n“What word from Field Marshal Tine?” Taniel asked.\n“He said to consider hostilities resumed,” Gavril said. “Any sign of a\nnighttime attack?”\nShit. “No movement on the mountainside all day long.”\n“The diggers?”\n“No sign of them, either.”\nThe sappers had kept going, even through the week-long truce between\nthe armies. Taniel had wanted to go down and flush them out, but Gavril\ninsisted they keep their side of the truce.\n“What are they digging for?” Gavril growled. “They’re too far out to\nundermine us, and Bo said they haven’t been using sorcery to dig.”\n“Have you seen Bo?” Taniel asked. “He’s been feet up in a mug of ale\n‑\nall week and looks like he’s been to the pit and back. I don’t trust he can tell\nsorcery from a molehill right now.”\n“Oh, come now,” a quiet voice said. “I’m not that bad.”\nTaniel turned to see Bo standing a little ways off from the group. Had"

Had\nhe been there the whole time? He frowned at his friend. Bo carried a flask,\nand he was leaning on Katerine. The woman gave Taniel a withering look.\nTaniel said, “You need to be sleeping, not drinking.”\n“There’s trickery in this,” Bo said, gesturing toward the Kez army.\n“Who knows what they’re planning?”\n“What can we do?” Taniel said. “They’re well covered from artillery\nfire. When we bombarded the hill above their cave, there was no sign of\nhaving collapsed their tunnels. We have no idea how deep those tunnels are,\nor where they lead to. They could be trying to undermine the bastion, or\ncome up in the middle of the town, or pit, with the help of sorcerers they\ncould be trying to pass under the whole Mountainwatch and come out in\nAdro.”\n“A sobering thought,” Bo said. “But you said you’ve not seen sign of\nthe diggers all day.”\n“They’re still going. No doubt about it.”\n“That’s why I’ve come to a decision,” Gavril said. They both looked to\nGavril. “I’m going to lead a sortie to clear the mine.”\n“When?” Taniel took a sniff of powder.\n“Tomorrow,” Gavril said. “If I can sober Bo up.”\n“I’m plenty sober,” Bo said. He swayed, and would have fallen if\nKaterine had not been holding him up.\nGavril appeared not to notice. “I want to say it will be a minimum-risk\nsortie. Their army is hours away. But if Julene is there—or even a couple of\nlower-grade Privileged—we’ll need more than just Bo.” He looked\nexpectantly at Taniel. “The sortie will be… volunteer.”\nTaniel tried to snort. It made his sinuses hurt. He’d done his best to stay\noff powder for the last week. He’d failed, but at least his nose hadn’t bled\nfor a few days. “I’ll go, of course.”\n“Thanks,” Gavril said. He looked somewhat relieved. “It’s not just you\nI need, though.”\nTaniel frowned, and then it dawned on him. “Ka poel.”\n‑\nGavril nodded.\n“I don’t know…” Taniel said. “She’s so young.”\n“She’s a sorcerer,” Gavril said. “A powerful one. I’ve had a talk with\nBo. He’s very interested in her.”\n“Very,” Bo said.\nTaniel scowled at them both.\nGavril paused for a moment, then added, “Not that way.”\n“Of course not,” Bo said.\nTaniel still scowled. “Ka poel is under my protection,” he said. In\n‑\nreality, he was under hers, or so Bo would have him believe. “Sure, she’s\nhelped me track Privileged, been in a scrape or two…” He remembered\nhow she’d thrown herself between him and Julene up on the mountain. She\nwas stronger than she looked.\nBo sighed. “Taniel, she makes most of the Kez Cabal look like children."

She\nwas stronger than she looked.\nBo sighed. “Taniel, she makes most of the Kez Cabal look like children.\nWe’re going to need her.”\nTaniel suddenly remembered the day he’d faced off against Rozalia in\nthe museum at Adopest University. She’d been nervous about Ka poel\n‑\njoining the fight. Had she been able to sense something Taniel hadn’t? “I\ndon’t think she’s that powerful, but let’s say she was—I won’t put her in\ndanger.”\n“It’s not up to you,” Gavril said.\n“By pit, it’s not.”\n“I already asked her. She’s coming with us.”\nTaniel leaned back, blinking. “You just went right past me on that?”\nGavril rolled his tongue around in his cheek. He met Taniel’s eyes. “I\nknow the risk we’re taking going down there, and she’s a bigger asset than\neven Bo at this point. I wanted to know she’d come before I made the\ndecision.”\nTaniel glared at Gavril. The big Watchmaster ignored him.\n“Tomorrow night?” Taniel asked.\n“Tomorrow night,” Gavril confirmed.\nTaniel put his hands in his pockets and headed back into the town alone.\nThe days were hot now, and the nights certainly warmer as summer closed\nin on Adro. This high in the mountains there’d always be a chill in the air\nwhen the sun went down. Taniel pulled his buckskin coat tight and listened\nto the wind as he got closer to the Howling Wendigo. It was an eerie thing,\nand it made him shudder.\nHe paused halfway down the street. The howl picked up as he walked\ntoward the Howling Wendigo, but he thought another sound had joined it,\nthen replaced it. It sounded similar, like a beast’s low yowl in the distance.\nThis was… more organic. He shivered and looked around. It came from\nhigher up the mountain, and on a clear night like this, when the stars shone\nbright overhead, the sound carried. He glanced toward the northeast pass.\nHe rubbed his eyes, looked again. It seemed as if something moved there.\nThe howl started again, a haunting, feral sound. Taniel remembered\nreading that there were no wolves on South Pike. Only cave lions. This\nsounded like no cave lion he’d ever heard. He swallowed and forced\nhimself to look away from the mountain.\nA movement in the corner of his eye, someone sneaking up toward him\nfrom the side, made him jump. The figure ran. He took off down the road in\npursuit. He dashed around a corner, to an alley, and grabbed the side of a\nbuilding to steady himself.\n“Damn you to the pit!” He grabbed Ka poel by the front of her long\n‑\nduster. His hands were shaking. “Don’t scare me like that.”\nShe looked up at him with big green eyes that drank in the moonlight.\nHe let go of her jacket and smoothed the front of his own. “Damn,” he said.\n“You spooked the pit out of me. What are you doing out here?”\nKa poel pointed to her eyes and then to him.\n‑\n“Watching me? What in Kresimir’s name for?”\nShe shrugged."

She’d cut her hair even\nshorter, almost above her ears. Taniel walked back into the street and sat\ndown on a stoop. Ka poel made to walk off.\n‑\n“Get over here,” Taniel said. He made sure his voice was not unkind.\nShe sidled up beside him like a girl whose father had threatened a lashing,\nbut who knew that an innocent smile would get her out of it. “Why didn’t\nyou tell me that Gavril asked you to go on his sortie?”\nKa poel raised one eyebrow at him. She pointed to her throat.\n‑\n“Yes, I know you can’t talk,” Taniel said. He rolled his eyes. “You\ndamn well come up with a way to tell me things when you want.”\nKa poel pursed her lips.\n‑\n“Don’t play coy with me. You do it all the time. I want an answer.”\nShe hugged herself, and then pointed to Taniel. Taniel shook his head.\nShe thumped one hand against her chest, over her heart, and pointed to him\nagain. You… love me? No, that can’t be right. He shook his head. Ka poel\n‑\nsighed. She mimed swinging a sword, and then raised the other arm.\n“Shield?” Taniel said.\nShe nodded, and pointed at him.\n“Shield me? Protect me? You want to protect me? What the pit? You’re\nwhat, fifteen years old? You shouldn’t be trying to protect me. You’re\nbarely past playing with dolls. Well…” Taniel remembered the doll she\nmade of Julene, and what it did. “You still play with dolls. Dangerously.\nBut you shouldn’t be protecting me.”\nTaniel imagined himself at fifteen. A headstrong, lanky boy with\nstraight black hair and just the beginnings of a beard. He had filled out since\nthen, grown stronger, taller, and already bore the scars of a seasoned\nsoldier. He felt old and he was barely twenty-two.\nKa poel turned her back on him.\n‑\n“Hey, don’t…”\nShe folded her arms.\nTaniel stood up, came up behind her. She flashed her fingers at him\nrapidly.\n“What?”\nShe did it again.\n“Nineteen? Oh, you? You’re nineteen.” Taniel was taken aback. “I\nalways thought you were a kid. Dynize are married off by sixteen.”\nShe shook her head, still not looking at him, and pointed at herself.\n“Not you, eh?”\nShe nodded.\n“Well, damn it, I don’t care how old you are, I don’t want you\nprotecting me.”\nShe turned around suddenly. Their faces were close enough for him to\nsmell her breath. It was sweet, like honey, and Taniel wondered absently\nwhat she’d been eating.\nToo bad, she mouthed.\nTaniel squared his jaw. Damned girl. “Why are you so worried about\nme?” he asked slowly.\nShe leaned in closer to him, their lips almost touching. He searched her\ndark eyes. They caught the starlight.

    "text": "me?” he asked slowly.\nShe leaned in closer to him, their lips almost touching. He searched her\ndark eyes. They caught the starlight. There was mischief in those eyes and a\nsmirk on her lips. Taniel felt his heart thump. She whirled and was gone,\nracing down the street.\nTaniel inhaled sharply, watching her go. “What was that?” he said\nquietly. He licked his lips and wondered what she tasted like. He pushed the\nthought from his mind. She was a servant, an uneducated savage. He\nshoved his hands in his pocket and headed down the street, hoping that she\nwouldn’t be there when he got back to his room at the officers’ barracks.\nChapter 30\nThe streets at the west end of Adopest’s dock district were anything but\nquiet at half past one in the morning. Singing floated into the streets from\nthe bars and bawdy houses, and more than a few groups of drunks had taken\ntheir merriment out onto the cobbles, shaking their fists at the wet sky and\nspitting bad poetry at anyone who’d listen.\nAdamat pressed himself into a dark corner, collar drawn up around his\nneck, wrapped tightly in a long black coat with a bowler hat to keep off the\nrain and shadow his face. SouSmith waited in another corner, the big boxer\nsurprisingly invisible in a patch of darkness two sizes too small for him.\nAdamat kept his eyes open and cane handy, ready to fix either of them on\nanyone sober enough to notice him.\nThe bawdy house opposite the street was a quiet affair compared with\nthe rest. Its clientele was wealthier than most and its outward appearance\nwas that of a butcher’s shed—the place was called Molly’s Market, and it\ndidn’t accept new customers without a recommendation. A number of\nhulking men with big fists and small brains crouched under an awning near\nthe door. They were bodyguards and bouncers, whispering quietly to one\nanother as they struggled to stay warm. A couple had noticed Adamat and\ncast him dark looks, but none had come over to talk to him yet.\nThe door to the bawdy house opened, giving a brief glimpse of\nexpensive furnishings and black lace. Ricard Tumblar stopped in the\ndoorway and slipped a few coins to the man holding the door open before\nexiting into the rain.\nRicard walked with the gait of a man who’d drunk a lot but knew his\nlimits. He tipped his hat to the group of bodyguards. Two of them detached\nthemselves from the rest and came to his side. Ricard waved off one that\noffered him a parasol.\nAdamat waited until Ricard was close before stepping out of the\nshadows. He tipped back his hat to be recognized in the dim lamplight.\nRicard’s bodyguards stepped forward, reaching for knives, as the bouncers\nunder the canopy stood warily. Muggers were discouraged around Molly’s\nMarket.\n“Call off your boys,” Adamat said. “I just want to talk.”\nRicard put up one hand for his guards, another on his heart. “Adamat,\nby Kresimir you scared me. What is it?”\nAdamat twitched his head and took a few steps away from the guards.\nRicard followed him."

    "text": "by Kresimir you scared me. What is it?”\nAdamat twitched his head and took a few steps away from the guards.\nRicard followed him.\n“You know you can come to me at my office anytime,” Ricard said.\n“My door is always open.” Ricard wasn’t wearing a hat and he put his hand\nup to keep the rain out of his eyes.\n“I’ve got a warning for you,” Adamat said. “As an old friend.”\nRicard had never taken kindly to threats, whether real or implied, and\nAdamat put a hand on his shoulder to reassure him.\n“There are circumstances,” Adamat said, “that are forcing me to\nconsider you a prime suspect as Tamas’s traitor.”\nRicard’s mouth formed a hard line, but he remained silent. Now was the\ngamble. If Ricard was indeed the traitor, he’d set his goons on Adamat.\n“You need to clean your house, Ricard,” Adamat said. “Kez spies are\nbeing smuggled in over the Adsea. Kez Wardens, too. Tamas is not pleased.\nI think Tamas will hold off for now, because he needs your ships\ndesperately to ferry his men to the Gates.”\n“What does this have to do with me?” Ricard said. His tone was\ncontrolled, but there was anger there.\nAdamat poked him in the chest for emphasis. “The docks are your\nterritory, my friend. Tamas knows what’s going on down here, and if he\nfeels threatened, he’ll shut down everything. All the trade to Novi and\nUnice, all your factories and mills.”\nRicard’s eyes went wide. “He can’t. That’d tear the heart out of\nAdopest, and the union would be up in arms.”\n“He might have to, if he thinks he’s got enemies down here.”\nRicard seemed to think on this for a moment. “Who else knows you are\nhere?”\nAdamat’s heart leapt. He gripped his cane a bit tighter, not willing to go\ndown without a fight. If luck held, he might fend the three of them off until\nSouSmith could cross the street.\n“No one,” Adamat said.\n“No one sent you?”\n“I came on my own.”\nRicard gazed at him for a moment, his eyes weighing the situation, as if\ndeciding where to put the knife. Adamat considered calling out to\nSouSmith.\n“Thank you,” Ricard said. “If you came to these conclusions yourself…\nI may have some cleaning to do, indeed. Thank you, my friend.”\nAdamat watched Ricard walk into the night, finally taking that parasol\nfrom his bodyguard. His walk was more sober, quicker, as if he now had\nsomewhere to go. SouSmith drew up quietly next to Adamat.\n“Take your warning?” SouSmith asked.\n“I don’t know,” Adamat said. “He didn’t try to kill me, so that’s a start.\nBut he might have known what game I was playing. He’s not an idiot.\nWe’ll see what he does next.”\n“What now?”\n“I have other suspects. I still have to see the arch-diocel, the Proprietor,\nand Prime Lektor.”\nSouSmith gave Adamat a frown. “The Proprietor? Can’t get to him.”"

    "text": "and Prime Lektor.”\nSouSmith gave Adamat a frown. “The Proprietor? Can’t get to him.”\n“I’ll think of something.” Adamat tried to sound confident. “I suppose\nthat means the arch-diocel is next.”\nSouSmith made the sign of the Rope. “Don’t like that.”\nWiser words had rarely been spoken. “He knows I’m coming. We’ve an\nappointment with him in the morning.”\nA young, nervous-looking priest stood on the front step of the arch-diocel’s\nhome and watched Adamat’s carriage approach with an air of expectation.\nThe home itself was a sprawling affair of a villa, only one story high but\nwith a footprint to rival Skyline Palace. The style of architecture was far-\neastern Gurlish with accenting white spires rising above a marble façade.\nThere were satin drapes in onion-shaped windows. Vineyards stretched off\nto one side of the long cobblestone drive. On the other, grooms trained\nracing stallions on a horse track.\nIt was said, Adamat reflected as he stepped from the carriage and\nstretched his legs, that the arch-diocel was much more a man of pleasures\nthan a man of Kresimir. Yet wasn’t that the way of the Church these days?\nOh, there were genuine priests; men who loved Kresimir and their fellow\nman and toiled for peace and brotherhood. But Charlemund’s type was far\nmore common. Their love of women and gold and power burned in them\nlike a fever.\nThe young priest approached Adamat at a quick shuffle. He wore white\nrobes down to his ankles and sandals on his feet; the clothes of an\nimpoverished monk, despite the obvious wealth of the place.\n“I am Siemone,” the priest said. He looked at his feet, his hands clasped\nbefore him as if praying.\n“You serve the arch-diocel?” Adamat asked.\n“I have the pleasure of serving Kresimir, sir,” Siemone responded, “by\nattending to his righteous servant Charlemund, arch-diocel of Adro.”\n“I’ve an appointment with the arch-diocel,” Adamat said. “Are we to\nwait inside?” He pointed to the front door with his cane.\n“Er, no, sir,” Siemone said. He wrung his hands as if he were cleaning\nhis laundry. “The house is very full right now. His Lordship’s extended\nfamily has come to the villa to celebrate the Saint Adom’s Day festivities.\nChildren running underfoot, shoulder to shoulder.”\nAdamat glanced through a window. He could see a very big man\nwatching him from inside the window—probably one of the arch-diocel’s\nbodyguards. No sign, nor sound of children. Admittedly, the villa was huge.\nCharlemund could put an army in there and one would see no sign of it. The\ncurtain was drawn closed from the inside.\n“I see,” he said. It was an odd way to treat one’s guests, even if Adamat\nwas unwelcome.\nSiemone cleared his throat. “Besides, the arch-diocel is a very busy\nman. We’ll have to go find him at the chapel. What with the orgy this\nmorning, he’s running late for the afternoon prayer service.”"

    "text": "man. We’ll have to go find him at the chapel. What with the orgy this\nmorning, he’s running late for the afternoon prayer service.”\n“Excuse me?” Adamat blanched. “The morning orgy?”\n“Yes,” Siemone said. “Now, if you please, the arch-diocel doesn’t like\nto feel threatened. He’ll have to stay here.” He gestured at SouSmith, who\nwas just climbing out of the carriage, his hair tousled from a long nap.\n“This is my associate,” Adamat said. “He’s aiding me in my\ninvestigation. He is no threat to the arch-diocel.”\nSiemone looked anywhere but directly at Adamat. “You mistake my\nmeaning, sir. Your associate is a very large man, well built, and obviously a\nfighter of some kind. The arch-diocel doesn’t like the eyes of his servants\nwandering. He, ah, doesn’t like the competition, sir. His worship is very\nparticular about which of his guests are allowed on the grounds.”\nAdamat blinked at the priest. Doesn’t like the competition…? He shook\nhis head. “You’d better stay in the carriage then,” he said to SouSmith.\nThe boxer grunted and climbed back inside without a word.\n“You said your master is running late?” Adamat said.\nThe corner of Siemone’s mouth twitched. “Yes, the orgy. Now, please,\ncome with me. We can catch him right after the prayer service, before the\nafternoon races start.”\nSiemone raised a hand. A small buggy emerged from the vineyard,\nwhere it had been concealed a moment before, and came up next to them.\nAdamat couldn’t take his eyes off the driver. She was young, perhaps\nsixteen, and had long golden hair, down to her waist. She wore a simple\ndriver’s uniform, a smock, hat, and gloves to hold the reins—but they were\nall of translucent silk, and she wasn’t wearing anything underneath. The girl\ngave him a polite smile.\n“Sir?” she said. “If you will.”\nAdamat tore his eyes away and climbed into the back of the buggy.\nThere was only room for one, and he turned to Siemone. Before he could\ninquire where the priest would ride, the buggy began to move, pulled by a\nsingle white pony. The priest jogged alongside.\nAdamat clutched his hat as a brisk wind nearly tore it from his head.\nThey moved quickly down a path into the vineyard, passing a number of\nworkers. Despite their pace and Siemone’s long robe, the priest kept up\nwith the buggy without seeming bothered. Adamat noted that Siemone kept\nhis eyes on the ground at his feet or straight ahead, and it was clear why.\nThey passed a number of workers, pruning the grapevines or tending the\ngrounds. All the workers wore basic tunics, but as with the buggy driver,\nthey were all made out of sheer silk. Both men and women worked the\nvines. They were all young and beautiful.\nHow could such a place exist?

    "text": "pleasure dens in all of Adopest, but this… These men and women would be\nprize pieces at a millionaire’s brothel, each one worth a thousand krana a\nnight. Yet they worked the fields in such clothes at the arch-diocel’s villa.\n“You seem… awfully out of place here, Siemone,” Adamat said. He\nrealized too late how that must sound and cringed. “Not that you aren’t a\nhandsome young man,” he added quickly.\nA smile flitted across Siemone’s lips, but he didn’t look up. “I know\nyour meaning, sir,” he said. “This is my penance. If I act as the arch-\ndiocel’s steward for just another year, my application for a marriage license\nwill be approved.” A look of worry furrowed his brow. “If she still wants\nme, that is.”\nThe Kresim Church allowed the lowest orders of the priesthood to\nmarry, only requiring them to remain celibate if they wished to gain more\npower within the Church. Even those that married often had to pay some\nkind of penance.\nCharlemund was a cruel man to require this of a priest. “Tell me,”\nAdamat said, “has the villa always been like this? I’ve heard that it is a\nmagnificent place with vineyards and stables. I didn’t realize it was so…\nunique.” He’d heard the rumors, of course. Everyone had. But he’d never\nbelieved them. A brothel in one of the outbuildings, perhaps, or a few\nbeautiful women at his beck and call. This was beyond debauched.\n“Yes, sir,” Siemone said. “It’s not new. The arch-diocel has a policy.\nHis visitors may pick from anyone they see here—excluding myself—and\ndo as they fancy. Oh, that includes you, sir, as you are a guest.”\nAdamat felt his face flush. “Oh no. No.” He drew the word out long,\nembarrassed that it turned into a nervous laugh. “I’m a happily married old\nman. I’m quite fine, thank you.”\nSiemone continued, “The arch-diocel’s policy is that anyone who\nspeaks of his… servants… isn’t invited back.”\n“There’s no way to keep track of that.”\n“Oh, the arch-diocel knows, sir. He has ears everywhere.”\nAdamat couldn’t help but smile wryly. “If that’s the case, then I can see\nhow that would encourage silence. Does every one of the arch-diocel’s\nguests partake of his hospitality?”\n“No,” Siemone said. “Not all. But those that don’t are generally the type\nwith the taste not to speak of what they see.”\nOr the shame, Adamat realized. No one talked because they didn’t want\nto implicate themselves in whatever sordid misdeeds could be found at the\nvilla. It was the same reason a gentleman never speaks of the bawdy house\nhe frequents.\nHe removed his hat to scratch his head, and spoke to Siemone in a flat\ntone. “So, you essentially work at the biggest brothel in all of Adro… by\nthe pit, all the Nine… so that one day you can marry your beloved and\nremain a man of the Rope?”"

The chapel itself was simple enough, built of small limestone blocks\nand no bigger than a medium-sized house. It was about two stories tall, with\na steep roof and a balcony just above the main door. A gold-braided rope\nhung from the balcony. Adamat was relieved to see that the area was free of\nthe arch-diocel’s servants.\nAdamat disembarked the buggy and watched it roll around the corner of\nthe chapel before he approached the door. He reached out just as Siemone\ntouched his shoulder.\n“Please, sir, they will be finished with prayer in a moment,” Siemone\nsaid.\nAdamat sighed. “Was I just about to walk in on an orgy?”\nFor a moment it looked like Siemone would laugh, but he just shook his\nhead. “No, it is the afternoon prayer service. Just wait a moment.”\nDespite the priest’s objections, Adamat pushed the door open just a\ncrack. The inside of the chapel contained several rows of velvet-cushioned\nbenches. The walls were plaster, but half-covered in rich tapestries of gold\nand red depicting smoking mountains and Kresimir descending from his\nRope to the top of South Pike Mountain. There were only a small handful of\npeople attending the sermon, though the chapel could seat at least thirty.\nThe arch-diocel stood at the front of the chapel, arms raised above him,\nface tilted toward the sky. His voice drifted through the chapel.\n“And mighty Lord Kresimir, protect us from the unjust and the wicked,\nand deliver us from evil, that we might be taken into your fold…”\nAdamat let the door close quietly. He retreated to the old stone wall of\nthe chapel with Siemone and leaned against the cool brick.\n“The place seems rather… deserted,” Adamat said.\n“What do you mean?”\n“The arch-diocel is an important man. I expected to see more visitors.\nMessengers, clerks, all the like.”\n“Oh,” Siemone said, “very few visitors are allowed on the grounds\nproper. His Eminence sees everyone at the villa itself. It’s a very busy\nhouse, to be sure.”\n“And why am I so special?”\n“Well, you have the field marshal’s writ!”\nAt least that was something.\n“How long have you been here?” Adamat asked.\n“Two years, seven days.” Siemone still refused to look directly at him,\nbut Adamat thought he understood this now. Siemone was trying to keep\nhimself as pure as possible for his potential marriage—a respectable thing,\neven if that meant that he rarely made eye contact with anyone. To avoid\nthe lust around him, he had to stare at his own feet.\n“You don’t get out much, do you?”\n“I go into Adopest occasionally. On His Lordship’s errands.”"

On His Lordship’s errands.”\nMy word. “Why don’t you leave?” Adamat asked. “You don’t need to\nserve penance to get a normal marriage license.”\n“I’m a man of the Rope, sir. If I leave now, I’ll forfeit my rope.” His\nhand brushed a small rope stitched to his robe above his left breast. “And\nI’ll forfeit my chances to wed.”\n“She wants to marry a priest, eh?”\n“Many priests marry.”\n“I’ve never heard of a penance like this. Aren’t they usually, what, six\nmonths?”\nSiemone looked somewhat miserable. “It’s the arch-diocel’s niece, sir.”\nAdamat gave Siemone as sympathetic a look as he could muster. “You\npoor, poor bastard.”\n“The service is finished, sir.”\nThe front door of the chapel opened even as Siemone spoke. A number\nof buggies began to roll around from the opposite side of the chapel and\nwaited for their fare. Seven men and women came out and loaded into the\nbuggies. They were dressed in rich silks and leathers and the finest muslin.\nAdamat recognized a few of them as wealthy merchants. To his surprise, he\nnoted Madame Lourent, a recent client of his. She was from an affluent\nfamily, and he was frankly shocked she’d survived Tamas’s purge of the\nnobility. She passed him without acknowledgment.\nAdamat imagined Ricard in one of those buggies. He’d fit in perfectly\nin a place like this, though he wouldn’t do much praying. The buggies\ntrotted away, across the field but not toward the front drive. They were\nheading for the back of the house for whatever tawdry amusements\nCharlemund had planned next. Adamat shook his head in wonderment.\nThe arch-diocel came out after everyone else had left and walked slowly\ntoward Adamat.\n“Good afternoon,” Adamat said.\nCharlemund ignored Adamat’s greeting. Siemone hurried past the arch-\ndiocel to lock the chapel doors behind him, then quickly turned to take the\narch-diocel’s robes of office.\n“Siemone,” the arch-diocel said, “Lady Jarvor fell asleep during the\nprayer session. This is the third time. Have her barred from the villa\ngrounds.”\n“Yes, Your Eminence.”\n“And who is this?”\n“Inspector Adamat, Your Eminence.”\nThe arch-diocel squared his shoulders and looked down his nose at\nAdamat. “Tamas’s hound. Right. Why are you here?”\nAdamat looked the arch-diocel up and down. Charlemund was an\nimposing man, standing a full head taller than Adamat, and before he’d\nbecome a man of the Rope, he had been the fencing champion of all of\nAdro. He still moved gracefully enough, his steps long and purposeful, his\narms giving him a significant advantage of reach over other men.

It had been a scandal, and was\ntalked about for years, though his appointment was never rescinded.\nCharlemund had powerful friends.\nThe arch-diocel also had two large bruises on his face, covered up as\nwell as possible with a dusting of white powder.\n“Your Eminence,” Adamat said, bowing his head. “I hope you are\nfeeling well after your fall last week. I saw it happen. Dreadful accident.”\nCharlemund snorted. “Get on with it. Why are you here?”\nHe annoyed easily, Adamat noted. He felt another pang of pity for\nSiemone. “I’m here to ask you about the assassination attempt on Field\nMarshal Tamas last month.”\n“That? Hasn’t it been cleared up yet? Bah. The races start soon, so be\nquick with your questions.”\nAdamat bit his tongue. Arch-diocel or not, there was common decency\nto be observed. In a gentle tone, he said, “Your Worship, I’m conducting an\ninvestigation into treason, not an inquiry into your favorite strumpet. Now,\nplease, I have a few questions to ask you.”\nSiemone stood behind the arch-diocel, holding his robes, and the poor\npriest’s eyes looked about to pop from their sockets. He stared fixedly at\nsome point off in the distance and shook his head violently.\nThe arch-diocel gave Adamat a second look.\n“You’re perhaps the most powerful man on Tamas’s council,” Adamat\nsaid, “maybe even including the field marshal himself. You have the\nbacking of the entire Kresim Church, an institution that dwarfs Lady\nWinceslav’s mercenaries, Ricard Tumblar’s union, and the Proprietor’s\ncriminal affairs in size, wealth, and strength. It gives me reason to believe\nthat if you wanted Tamas dead, he would indeed be dead.”\nAdamat went on, “The only thing that gives me hesitation in removing\nyour name from my list is that I can’t for the life of me discover why you\nsupported the coup in the first place. You have motive for neither\nsupporting Tamas nor wanting him dead… that I can discover.”\n“What gives you authority to question me?” the arch-diocel asked\ncoldly.\nAdamat produced Tamas’s note from his breast pocket and held it out to\nthe arch-diocel. Siemone stepped forward and took it with an apologetic\nmumble. He cleared his throat and read it out loud.\nThe arch-diocel threw back his head and roared with laughter.\n“Cooperate with you? Answer your questions? What care I if Tamas\nsuspects me? What can he do? He needs me in this war. He needs me to\nkeep the Church out of things.”\nAdamat took the note back from Siemone and folded it into his pocket.\n“I could spit on Tamas,” the arch-diocel went on, “and still have him\nbeg for my support. You think I care about this investigation?” He shook\nhis head. “No, not one wit. You are right about one thing, though; if I"

    "text": "beg for my support. You think I care about this investigation?” He shook\nhis head. “No, not one wit. You are right about one thing, though; if I\nwanted Tamas dead, he’d be in a pauper’s grave right now. Tamas will deal\nwith a higher power one day soon for the things he’s done. I have no need\nto get involved.”\nA higher power? Adamat wanted to scoff. Charlemund wasn’t exactly\nthe model priest. Adamat took a deep breath and leaned forward on his\ncane, looking the arch-diocel straight in the eye. He knew he was going to\npay for this persistence.\n“What,” Adamat asked, “is your interest in supporting Tamas?”\nThe arch-diocel met his gaze. He seemed to consider Adamat as one\nconsiders a mouse that will not get out of the pantry but is too pathetic to\nsquash underfoot. “The Church deemed it necessary that Manhouch be\nremoved from his position. The monarchy of Adro had pulled too far away\nfrom the people.”\nAdamat bit back a comment about a holy man running a bawdy house\nout of his villa. “Does the Church still support Tamas?”\n“That is a question Tamas may ask me,” the arch-diocel said. “Not his\ndog. Now, if you really want to get somewhere with your investigation you\nshould question Ricard Tumblar, or perhaps Ondraus the Reeve. They are\nboth untrustworthy men—men that should not be on Tamas’s council.”\n“Why is that?” Adamat asked quietly.\n“Neither man works for the good of Adro. Ricard is a blasphemer,\nhidden from justice behind his godless unions. He accepts bribes from any\nquarter—”\n“Excuse me, how do you know that?”\nCharlemund stumbled on this. His lip curled in a sneer. “Do not\ninterrupt me.”\n“I beg your pardon.”\n“He has accepted bribes from the Kez, from criminals and gangs. He is\na corrupt man, evil and beyond Kresimir’s love.”\n“How do you know that he has accepted bribes from the Kez?”\n“The Church has its sources. Do not question me.”\n“And Ondraus?”\n“The man tries to levy taxes against the Church,” Charlemund said.\n“His soul is in great peril. He fights me—a man of Kresimir!—on every\ntopic. He does not pay his tithe, and hides his books from Church\naccountants. Not even the king hid his books from our censure! Look\nthrough his books and I guarantee you will find evidence of treachery.” The\narch-diocel checked his pocket watch. “I will be late for the races. You may\nleave now, before I lose my patience.” Charlemund was off, bellowing for a\ncarriage, before Adamat could get in another word.\nAdamat watched him go. Charlemund’s opinions on Ondraus seemed to\nhold little weight. Simply dislike, nothing more. Yet it was the third time\nAdamat had heard tell that Ricard was receiving large sums of money. It\ndid not bode well.\n“I’ll have a look around the grounds now,” Adamat said to Siemone.\nThe priest gave a quick shake of his head. “I’m sorry, that’s not"

The arch-diocel’s family will not be bothered.”\nSiemone licked his lips. “It’s not that, sir, I… His Lordship is a very\nprivate man. I’m sorry, but you have to go now.”\nFurther arguing got Adamat no closer to even a tour of the grounds.\nWhen it became clear he was expected to leave immediately, Adamat\nbrushed off the offer of a buggy from Siemone and strode briskly back to\nhis carriage. He climbed in, more than ready to be gone from the villa, and\nshook SouSmith awake.\n“How do you feel,” Adamat asked, “about investigating the arch-\ndiocel’s villa grounds under the cover of night?”\nSouSmith’s eyes widened. “Quick way into a pine box.”\n“Indeed.” Adamat tapped his fingers on the coach window as they\npulled away from the villa. “Still… we have work to do.”\nChapter 31\nTamas woke with a start. His clothes were soaked with sweat, his body\nalmost too hot to breathe. He could see the sun through one of the windows;\nit was past ten in the morning.\n“Sir,” Olem greeted him. The bodyguard stood over him. He held a\nbowl of porridge in one hand, a newspaper in the other. He’d had some rest,\napparently, though Tamas didn’t know how if the man never slept. Olem’s\neyes looked more lively, and the wrinkles on his face had smoothed out. He\nset breakfast down and helped Tamas to a sitting position. “Compliments of\nMihali,” Olem said, setting the bowl on Tamas’s bedside table.\nTamas shook his head to clear the sleep from his brain. He felt foggy-\nheaded and slow. Five days since his surgery, and Brigadier Barat’s death.\nTamas’s damned leg hurt more every hour. It began to throb the moment he\nmoved it.\n“Would you like to read on the balcony?” Olem said. “Doctor Petrik\nsaid the air would do you good.”\nTamas considered the sunny weather through the window. He looked at\nhis leg. Pain, or being stuck inside all day? “Fine.”\nOlem helped him up and handed him his crutch, and they slowly made\ntheir way out onto the balcony. Olem headed back in for a chair while\nTamas hobbled over to the railing. “Awfully loud today,” he murmured. He\nglanced over the edge. There were a lot of people in the square. A second\nlook, and he realized the square was close to full. He hadn’t seen a crowd\nlike this since the Elections.\n“Olem!” He turned, startled when the bodyguard was right there.\n“Sir?” Olem wore a self-satisfied smile, a cigarette in the corner of his\nmouth and a chair in hand. Tamas didn’t like it at all.\n“What the pit is this?” Tamas gestured down to the square.\nOlem craned his neck. “Oh, yes. Mihali’s work.”"

    "text": "“What the pit is this?” Tamas gestured down to the square.\nOlem craned his neck. “Oh, yes. Mihali’s work.”\nThe square below was filled with dozens—no, hundreds—of tables, and\nchairs around each one. Every table was fully occupied, with countless\nmore people still standing, waiting for their turn at a place to sit. More\npeople stood in line; men, women, children. The line stretched down the\nMartyrs’ Avenue and around the corner. Tamas leaned out, though it hurt to\ndo so, searching for the head of the line.\nIt was right below them. Long, rectangular tables—Tamas recognized\nthem from the Hall of Lords—stretched the whole length of the building.\nThe tables were covered in food. Mountains of bread. Vats of soup. Meat\nroasting on spits. More food than one would find at a king’s feast.\nTamas turned on Olem. “Wipe that smug look off your face and help\nme down the stairs.”\nIt took some time, but Tamas was able to hobble down to the front of\nthe House of Nobles with Olem’s help. Tamas paused. The crowd had\nlooked overwhelming from the top of the building. It looked twice the size\nfrom here. He paused, astonished, on the front step.\n“Excuse me, sir.”\nTamas shuffled out of the way. A squad of soldiers moved past him,\ncarrying a table from the Hall of Lords. They were followed by clerks\nbringing chairs and then a cook with a bowl of soup almost too big for her\nto carry. Everywhere he looked, people were either eating, waiting their\nturn, or helping. Accountants, soldiers, townsfolk, even sailors and\ndockworkers. It seemed as if everyone had been pressed into service.\n“I trust you’re responsible for this?”\nTamas turned to find Ondraus. The reeve was furious. His spectacles\nperched on the bridge of his nose, an old ledger clutched to his chest. His\nlip was curled up, and sweat poured from his brow. His face was red with\nshouting. “I can’t get anyone to go back to work! They say that Mihali\nasked for their help and then they just ignore me!”\nTamas didn’t know what to say. He searched the crowd, looking for the\ntall, fat figure of the master chef.\n“Where is this food coming from?” Ondraus said. “Who is paying for\nit?” He lifted his ledger and smacked it with one hand. “There are no\nrecords! No receipts. Not a krana is out of place, yet this! I can’t understand\nit. You said he had a Knack for food, but this is ridiculous! Nothing is free,\nTamas. There has to be a price!”\nTamas found himself drifting away from Ondraus, hobbling slowly, and\nsoon the reeve’s voice was drowned out by the sound of conversation. He\npassed his gaze across the people. Merchants sat next to scullery maids,\nminor nobles shared their plates with sailors and street urchins. Tamas\nstumbled. A strong hand caught him, helped him right himself. Tamas\nturned to Olem. “I… I don’t understand.”\nOlem said nothing."

Tamas\nturned to Olem. “I… I don’t understand.”\nOlem said nothing.\nAcross the square, the gates of Sabletooth were open, and prison\nwagons rolled out and joined a long line of breadwagons waiting to be\nloaded down and sent to the far corners of the city. Tamas caught sight of\nblue uniforms—soldiers directing the wagons. “Who gave them\npermission?” Tamas asked, pointing to Sabletooth.\n“I’m sorry,” a great, booming voice said, “but you did.” As if from\nnowhere, Mihali appeared next to Tamas, his hands stuffed in the pockets\nof his apron. He wore a grin from ear to ear.\n“I did?” Tamas asked.\n“Aye,” Mihali said. Sheepishly, he added, “At least, that’s what I told\nthem. But worry you not, they’ll be back when needed. I put one of your\npowder mages in command of the breadwagons. Vlora, I think her name\nwas.”\nTamas said, “Where’s Lady Winceslav? She was supposed to be in\ncharge of the festival.”\n“Sir,” Olem said, “the Lady has gone into seclusion. Mihali has taken\ncharge.”\nTamas had no reply. He looked around and said to Mihali, “What have\nyou done?”\nMihali’s grin stretched even bigger, and Tamas thought he saw tears\nglisten in the corner of the big chef’s eyes. “I am… grateful,” he said. “I am\ngrateful that you patched things up with the arch-diocel. I am grateful that\nyou have finally welcomed me as one of your own. So in gratitude I have\nlistened to the heart of the city. I’ve found what Adro needs, Field\nMarshal.”\n“What does it need?” Tamas whispered.\n“The people are hungry,” Mihali said. He lifted his hands, spreading\nthem to encompass the city. “The people need to be fed. They need bread\nand wine and soup and meat. But not just that. They need friendship.” He\npointed to a minor noble, some viscount decked out in his finest foppish\nfrills, who poured a bottle of St. Adom’s Festival wine into the cups of a\nhalf-dozen street urchins.\n“They need companionship,” Mihali said. “They need love and\nbrotherhood.” He turned to Tamas. He reached out with one hand, putting a\npalm to Tamas’s cheek. Instinct told Tamas to step back. He found that he\ncouldn’t.\n“You gorged them on the blood of the nobility,” Mihali said gently.\n“They drank, but were not filled. They ate of hatred and grew hungrier.” He\ntook a deep breath. “Your intentions were… well, not pure, but just. Justice\nis never enough.” He let go of Tamas and turned to the square. “I will put\nthings right,” he said. He puffed out his chest and spread his arms. “I will\nfeed all of Adro.

Serve the poor on silver. Let the merchants sup from\nwooden bowls. Take food to every part of the city. The wagons will be\nprotected.”\n“How?” Tamas managed.\n“I am Adom reborn,” Mihali said. “Adro must be united. My people\nwill go to battle nourished.”\n“Adom,” Tamas scoffed. He found he could put no strength behind it.\nA man in a worker’s apron approached Mihali. “Sir,” he said slowly.\nMihali turned. “Ricard Tumblar sent us over. He told us to help with\nwhatever you need.”\n“ ‘Us’?” Mihali asked.\nThe worker gestured. Behind him, other workers stretched out across\nthe square, intermingled with the tables and the line, their aprons dirty with\nsoot and burns and flour and blood. It looked as if the workers from every\ndock-front factory and riverside mill were there. The worker smiled. “He\nshut down the factories, sir. But we’ll still get paid as long as we come\nhelp.”\n“The Noble Warriors of Labor, eh?” Mihali asked.\nThe man nodded. “All of us, sir.”\nMihali’s eyes grew wide. “Excellent! Come, I’ll show you where to\nhelp.”\nMihali wandered off, giving orders here, offering advice there. Tamas\nwatched him go. “A remarkable man,” he said. “Mad or not.”\nNila didn’t like Mihali’s cooking.\nIt was beginning to destroy her resolve. Every day she could feel her\nhatred slipping. Every day she paid just a little less attention to Field\nMarshal Tamas’s habits, watched just a little less carefully for her chance to\nend his bloody campaign. She didn’t know how she knew, but it was the\nfood that was doing it.\nShe tried getting her bread from Bakerstown. It just didn’t taste the\nsame, and Mihali was giving away food for free in Elections Square.\nNila couldn’t wait any longer. It had to be done tonight. Olem was on\nduty, but that couldn’t be helped. She liked him, she really did. He’d been\nkinder to her the last few days than any man she’d met in her time under\nDuke Eldaminse. But Tamas had to be stopped.\nShe did the lower officers’ laundry first, after everyone had gone to bed.\nShe went about her routine as usual, scrubbing and boiling and ironing, and\nthen returning uniforms to their owners’ rooms. She waited to fetch the\nfield marshal’s clothes till last. She always did. They were given special\nattention.\nThe hallway to the field marshal’s office had four guards. They\nrecognized her now. Nila even knew a few by name. Since Olem had begun\ncourting her, no one’s eyes lingered nor did anyone say anything untoward.\nThey let her pass without comment, but it worried her that Olem wasn’t\nthere.

What if he was inside?\nThe field marshal’s rooms were dark. She made her way by feel and\nmemory, and by a sliver of moonlight coming in through the balcony\nwindows. She satisfied herself that Olem was not anywhere in the darkness,\nand came up beside the field marshal. He snored softly, sleeping on his\nback on his cot. Nila drew a hidden dagger from her sleeve and paused.\nField Marshal Tamas’s brow and cheeks were covered in sweat. He\nmuttered something and shifted.\nShe lifted her knife.\n“Erika!” Tamas started in his sleep.\nNila froze. He settled back down to his cot, still deep in sleep. She took\nseveral breaths to steady her hand.\n“Nila,” someone whispered.\nNila closed her eyes. The door to the office opened a crack. “Nila,” the\nvoice whispered again. It was Olem.\nShe returned the knife to her sleeve and took the field marshal’s\nuniform from where it hung over a chair. She slipped out the door. She\nwould find out what Olem wanted and be rid of him. She still had to wash\nand return the clothing. There’d be another opportunity then.\nOlem waited for her in the hallway. The other guards pretended not to\nnotice as he took her hand and gave her a kiss on the cheek. His lips were\nwarm.\n“Thought I’d missed you,” he said, walking with her down the hall.\n“No.” She forced a welcoming smile on her face.\nHe linked arms with her. “I’m glad,” he said. “I don’t get much time off.\nWith my Knack and all, the field marshal likes me to put in extra hours.”\n“Of course.” She paused. “You should take more time for yourself.”\n“I would like to. But only to be with you.”\nThat wouldn’t do at all.\n“Are you sure?”\n“Sure about what?”\n“That you want to be with me?” She stopped and slipped her arm out of\nhis. “Why do you come to me, Olem? I’m not a good prospect. I’ve no\nfamily or connections, and you’ve not tried to force yourself on me. I don’t\nunderstand you.”\nThe corner of Olem’s mouth lifted. “When the time’s right, I won’t\nhave to force you.”\nShe smacked his shoulder, her cheeks flushing despite herself.\nHe laughed. “Come here,” he said. “I want to show you something.” He\ntook her arm again and led her down a side hallway. “You know,” he said,\n“I wondered about you after you disappeared from the Eldaminse\ntownhouse.”\n“You did?”\n“I wondered especially when we couldn’t find the Eldaminse boy.”\nNila tripped, and would have fallen if Olem didn’t have her arm. Her\nheart began to hammer in her chest.\nOlem continued, “Then I saw you at the barricades. I couldn’t get to\nyou.

He’d known all along\nthat she was a royalist. Why had it taken him so long to call her out? Why\nwasn’t she leaning over a headsman’s block instead of strolling down the\nhall with him?\nOlem stopped beside a soldier at a door at the end of one hall. The\nsoldier saluted him, and he acknowledged by touching a finger to his\nforehead. The soldier opened the door for them.\nHere it was, Nila thought. She was about to be put under guard. Hidden\naway until the next round of beheadings. Would they send her straight to\nSabletooth? She still had her knife. She could attack Olem… but he’d\nexpect that. She’d wait until he was gone and another guard had taken his\nplace.\nThe room was dark except for a single lantern on a table by a window.\nIt didn’t look like a prison cell. There was a bed, a writing desk, and a\ndivan. An old woman dressed in servant’s clothes snoozed in a chair next to\nthe bed.\n“Go on,” Olem said quietly.\nShe entered the room. Olem crossed over to the lantern and picked it up.\nThere was something on the table next to the lantern. A toy horse made of\nwood. Nila found herself kneeling by the bedside. There was a form there,\nsleeping soundly, bundled up to the chin beneath blankets.\nJakob looked healthier. His hair had been cut and dyed, his cheeks\nfuller, and there were now smile lines at the corners of his mouth.\n“Tamas is not the heartless man most people think he is,” Olem said.\n“He won’t kill an innocent child. He sent no one to the guillotine under the\nage of seventeen on the day of the Elections. He had a rumor started that all\nthe children of the nobility were strangled quietly in order to explain away\ntheir disappearance.”\nNila brushed her fingers across Jakob’s forehead. “What happened to\nthem? What will happen to him?”\n“Sent away,” Olem said. “Some to Novi or Rosvel. Some to the\ncountryside.”\n“Can I see him when he’s awake?”\n“No. He mustn’t know anyone from his former life. He mustn’t grow up\nthinking he’s something special. He’ll be sent to live on a farm, where his\nlife will be hard but not dangerous or complex. He might marry a laundress\nsomeday. But he’ll never be king.”\nNila knelt beside Jakob’s bedside for several minutes before Olem drew\nher away. The lamp was returned, and the guard locked the door to the\nnursery behind them. Around the corner, Nila clutched the field marshal’s\nuniform to her chest.\nOlem stood, hands clasped behind his back, face serious. “You must\nhate us,” he said. “For destroying your world. I’m sorry for that. But\nTamas… all of us… we did it so that the commoners can know a good life\nsomeday. So that we are no longer slaves.”\n“I was happy, I think,” Nila said."

So that we are no longer slaves.”\n“I was happy, I think,” Nila said.\n“The best kind of slavery,” Olem said. “But still slavery.” He fell silent\nfor a couple of moments. “I’ll understand if you want a transfer away from\nthe field marshal. It must be hard for you, knowing what he did to people\nyou once served. He’ll be furious. He says you’re the first laundress to\nstarch his collars right since he was in Gurla.”\n“And you?” Nila said.\nOlem struck a match and lit a cigarette, letting out a long sigh. “You\ncan’t like someone knowing your secret. The field marshal pardoned the\nroyalists, but there’s still no trust of them in the army. I won’t tell anyone.\nAnd I’ll leave you alone.”\nNila searched Olem’s face for insincerity. She couldn’t find any. She\nhad no doubt that if she said the word right now, he’d never speak to her\nagain. His cigarette rolled between his lips. He took a long puff, then took it\nout, looking away. Giving her time to think it over.\n“Are you sure you weren’t a gentleman in another life?” she asked.\n“Absolutely,” Olem said, turning back to her. His face was still\nuncommonly serious.\nNila tried to tell herself that this changed nothing. That Tamas was still\na monster who endangered Adro every moment he remained alive. But\nOlem had revealed that Tamas was human. That he had compassion. Nila\ncould not look into the eyes of another person and take their life when she\nknew they still had humanity.\nShe hated Olem for it.\n“I’d prefer,” she said, clasping her hands behind her back so that Olem\ncouldn’t see them shake, “that we not speak again.”\nOlem stiffened. His eyes fell, and his serious demeanor dropped long\nenough for her to see his sadness before he straightened his back. “Of\ncourse, ma’am.”\nNila watched him walk down the hall and brushed a tear from the corner\nof her eye. To do what needed to be done, she had to be cruel. No time to\ncry. There was still laundry to do before the house awoke.\nChapter 32\nTaniel approached the bastion gate wondering how the St. Adom’s Day\nFestival was progressing in Adro. They’d received a shipment of food that\nmorning: barrels of ale, salted pork, and beef of the highest quality. Much\nbetter fare than normally seen on the Mountainwatch.\nMozes was already at the gate, and armed to the teeth with knives,\npistols, and a rifle. Rina, the Watch kennelmaster and one of Bo’s women,\nstood opposite of Mozes, crouched among her dogs. The beasts gave a quiet\nwhine when Taniel approached. He squatted a few feet away and examined\nthem in the torchlight.\nThere were three big, long-haired mastiffs. They wore black spiked\ncollars, and were attached to Rina by nothing more than leather harnesses.\nBigger than wolves, they could pull her off the mountain easily if they\nwished.\n“What are the hounds for?” Taniel asked."

Her voice\nwas low, gentle. “I trained these three in the mines. They’ll cross forty\nyards and bring down a Privileged in a second. Musket fire doesn’t bother\nthem.” She scratched one behind the ears. He turned toward her, massive\nhead cocked, tongue rolling.\n“What are their names?”\nShe pointed to the biggest one. “Kresim.” The next, “Lourad.” She\npatted the one who she’d been scratching. “And this is Gael.”\nTaniel held a hand out to Kresim. The dog sniffed once and turned\naway.\n“They’re not trained to be friends,” she said.\n“They like you enough.”\nShe nodded. “I’m the master.”\n“I see.” Taniel stood up. Bo arrived with Katerine, who gave them all a\nlook of disapproval. Bo squatted beside Rina and slid a hand up around her\nwaist. Lourad growled low in the back of his throat.\n“Tst,” Rina hissed at the dog. Lourad lay down on the ground.\nBo backed off a step. “Damned big hounds,” he said to Taniel. “Things\nmake me nervous.”\n“You’re bedding their master,” Taniel said. “That’d make me nervous.\nI’m surprised you can stand after all the drink you’ve had.”\nBo craned his head toward Katerine. “She has ways of sobering a man\nup.”\n“None pleasant, I’d imagine.”\nBo cringed.\nKa poel emerged from the darkness of the town a few moments later\n‑\ndressed in her buckskins. Taniel had not seen them on her since Fatrasta.\nShe normally preferred her long dark duster and wide-brimmed hat. The\nbuckskins clung to her body, reminding Taniel she was a woman and not\njust a girl. Something he’d not noticed before. He noticed his hands were\nshaking from lack of powder, and took a sniff from his box. That steadied\nsomewhat. He inhaled deeply and tried to resist taking more until it was\nneeded.\nKa poel was followed by Fesnik, leading a pair of donkeys laden with\n‑\npowder barrels, and a few steps behind him was Gavril. They all gathered\naround the Watchmaster.\n“We’ve got enough powder to collapse their tunnel,” Gavril said. “We\ncan trust you to set it off when we’re at a safe distance?”\n“That much powder,” Taniel said. “We’d have to be too far away.”\nVlora could do it from that distance. She’d always been able to detonate\npowder from farther away than any mage Taniel knew—her unique talent.\n“We’ll use blasting cord, then,” Gavril said. “This will be quick. No one\nmakes any noise until we’ve checked the tunnel—Rina, that includes your\ndogs. Who knows what kinds of traps they have waiting for us, or how\nmany workers and soldiers they’ve got in there.

Once that’s done we’ll set\nthe powder, and then we hightail it out of there. We leave the donkeys if we\nhave to.”\n“What’d they do to deserve that?” Fesnik said.\nGavril rolled his eyes. “Everyone ready?”\nNods went around, and they left silently by the front gate.\nThe mountainside below was completely black all the way to\nMopenhague, where the Kez army still camped. They proceeded into the\ndarkness, going slow enough to let their eyes adjust. A sniff of black\npowder made Taniel’s brain buzz and brought his senses into sharp focus.\nThe darkness held few secrets for him. For that he was glad—he still\nremembered the howling from the other night, and the sense he’d gotten of\nevil creatures prowling the mountainside.\nTaniel went on ahead, Ka poel following twenty paces back. They\n‑\nmoved silently down the mountainside, their eyes sharp for Kez guards. Taniel\nreached the ruins of the first redoubt. It had been taken and retaken, then left\nfor nothing and finally smashed by artillery and sorcery. He expected guards,\nbut when he climbed among the stone rubble it was empty.\nHe checked each redoubt carefully. Were he the Kez, he would have left\na small guard at each of them to raise an alarm of a counterattack—however\nunlikely. In the fourth redoubt he found a body, head removed by a\ncannonball and the corpse stinking in the tatters of a Kez uniform: a soldier\nmissed by those who’d scoured the mountain for bodies the last week.\nThere were still no guards.\nThe digging started not far past the last redoubt. Taniel scouted the area\nfor some indication of the enemy. There were no lights, no signs of people,\nnor when he put his ear to the ground could he hear the sharp clicks of\nshovels and picks beneath him. Taniel frowned. Something was off about\nthis. He sent Ka poel back to let the others know they could come forward.\n‑\nNothing moved on the mountainside. Far below, the Kez camp glittered\nwith campfires. Taniel heard the crunch of rock beneath well-worn boots as\nthe others joined him.\nThey were on the road just above the entrance when one of the donkeys\nbrayed behind them. Taniel felt his heart leap into his throat. He dropped to\na sitting position, the barrel of his rifle resting on his foot so he could sight\ndown the mountain. He waited for a Kez head to come into sight, for shouts\nof warning and then the trumpet of a general alarm.\nA few minutes passed. He looked back at Bo and Gavril. Gavril’s face\nwas unreadable; Bo looked annoyed.\nBo signaled to Taniel, and then touched a finger to the middle of his\nforehead. Taniel nodded.\nTaniel opened his third eye. The brief dizziness passed and he turned his\nattention to his surroundings. The chalky, colored residue of sorcery\ncovered the entire mountain like spatters of whitewash on the ground\nbeneath a freshly painted fence. It was all old magic, though, and had begun\nto fade. He looked toward the tunnel."

He looked toward the tunnel.\nWhat he saw there was not old, and it had certainly not begun to fade.\nTwin streaks of color passed through the ground, under his feet, and up the\nmountain. Taniel closed his third eye and scrambled down the rocks to the\ntunnel, Ka poel right behind him.\n‑\n“What…? Taniel!” Gavril whispered. Taniel ignored him. He climbed\nup above the tunnels, and dropped down to the ground at their entrance.\nAbove him, Ka poel clicked her tongue. He checked for enemies before\n‑\ngesturing to her. When she jumped down, he caught her and set her on her\nfeet.\nTwo gaping holes faced him on the mountainside. The darkness was too\ndeep even for a Marked’s senses, but he suspected what he might see. A\npair of tunnels, each about a foot taller than a man, bored out completely by\nsorcery as if by a gigantic drill. He sighted along the tunnels, up the\nmountainside, and guessed at their destination.\nBo and Gavril joined them after a minute.\n“There’s no one here,” Gavril said, bewildered.\n“Thanks for pointing that out,” Bo snapped.\n“Shut up,” Taniel told Bo.\n“Where are all the sappers? Where’s the Privileged?” Gavril said.\nTaniel lifted a hand. “Up there.”\n“You mean they’re finished?”\n“Yes.”\n“And they come out…?”\n“Above the Mountainwatch,” Taniel said. “Up on the ridge. Last night I\nthought I saw something up there. I dismissed it as a trick of the moonlight.\nNow I don’t think I was seeing things.”\nGavril stared up toward the ridgeline far above them. “The sorcery\nrequired to carve these…”\n“Julene,” Bo said. “And probably half the Kez Cabal along with her.”\n“Then why didn’t they attack yet?” Gavril said. “The northeast pass is\nbarely guarded. There’s not even a watch on that wall half the time. They\ncould have hit us from up there with a thousand men and there’d have been\nlittle we could do about it.”\n“She doesn’t care about the Mountainwatch,” Bo said. “Never has.\nWhat she cares about is getting to the top of the mountain.”\n“It still doesn’t make sense,” Taniel said. “She could have destroyed\nShouldercrown and then headed up the mountain. Unless…”\n“She’s in a hurry,” Bo finished. He stared up toward South Pike’s peak\nthrough the darkness for several moments. “I’ve heard stories floating\naround the cabal, as old as Kresimir, that the most powerful Privileged\ncould use the auras of other planets, the moon, the stars, and the sun to\namplify their sorcery. She needs the summer solstice.”\nTaniel felt sick to his stomach. He took a shaky breath. A quick hit of\npowder helped. “But,” he said, “even if she’s in a hurry, why didn’t she tell\nField Marshal Tine about the tunnels? How could she hide them even from\nhim?”"

How could she hide them even from\nhim?”\n“I think there’s more going on in the Kez camp than we know,” Bo said.\n“Julene is using the royal cabal, for certain. Perhaps not Tine, though.”\nGavril scratched his chin. “How could she hide this? And if she didn’t\ntell him about it, why two tunnels?”\n“She hid it from us,” Taniel said. “And I think this is a backup plan. If\nshe can’t summon Kresimir, she still wants to be able to take the\nMountainwatch. I don’t think she banked on us just walking down here to\nfind it.”\nThey stared at the tunnels in silence for a few moments. “Can she really\nsummon Kresimir?” Gavril asked.\n“She can try,” Bo said. “Whether she’ll be successful… that all depends\non how many Privileged she has with her.”\n“I don’t like the idea of waiting to find out,” Taniel said. He turned to\nwalk back up to the Mountainwatch.\n“Where are you going?”\n“I’ll need some supplies if I’m going to chase her up the mountain.”\nBo caught up to Taniel faster than he expected. “That’s suicide,” he\nsaid. “She must have thirty or more Privileged with her. Maybe Wardens\nand soldiers. Once they get wind of you…” He snapped his fingers.\n“Gone.”\n“I’ll not let them get wind, then.”\nThey reached the others and told them of the situation.\n“I’m going after Julene,” Taniel said.\n“You mean, the one powerful enough to summon God?” Fesnik said.\nKaterine crossed her arms and gave Taniel a look that clearly said he\nwas an idiot. “I suppose you’ll tell us next that you’re going alone, as it’s\ntoo dangerous for the rest of us.”\nTaniel barked a laugh. “Pit, no. Anyone can come that wants. I don’t\nwant to die on that cold son of a bitch mountain alone.”\n‑ ‑ ‑\nBo nearly choked. “I’ll go,” he said.\n“Like pit you will,” Katerine snapped.\n“Get off it, woman,” Bo said. “Julene’s got to be stopped.”\n“Let the Marked do it.”\n“I’ll go with you too.” Rina’s quiet voice almost made Taniel jump. She\nstood off to the side, quietly holding the leashes to her dogs. “Where Bo\ngoes, I go.”\n“Don’t you…” Katerine began.\n“I said leave off!” Bo said.\nGavril looked torn. “I should,” he started, then fell silent.\nGavril wanted to come with them, Taniel realized, but the\nMountainwatch was his responsibility. If Field Marshal Tine resumed the\nattack, Gavril needed to be there to rally the defenders.\nTaniel said, “Your responsibility is here.” A thought occurred then.\n“Will the Novi monks let them pass?”\n“I don’t know,” Bo said. “If they don’t, Julene will level the monastery.”\n“Shit,” Gavril spat. “They are good people.” He turned to Mozes and"

Taniel watched the spark of flame work its way down the\nmountainside. It didn’t take long for the trail to reach the tunnel. The whole\nmountain rumbled when the powder went off, and Taniel felt dirt slide\nbeneath his feet. The last redoubt toppled into the remnants of the tunnel.\nWithin minutes there were more lights in the Kez camp, and sounds of\ncommotion rose from below.\nThey returned to the fortress. Taniel and the others collected more\nweapons and met back at the northeast gate a half hour later. The group was\nbigger than he’d wanted: Bo, Rina and her dogs, Fesnik, Mozes, and\nanother eight Watchers—rough-looking men he’d seen around the camp.\n“We shouldn’t take so many,” Taniel said to Gavril.\nThe big Watchmaster stood by the gate, clearly still torn about whether\nto accompany them. “You’ll need the manpower,” he said. “If you get into\na fight, spread out across the hill as much as you can. If the worst happens,\nsend someone running to let us know the pit just spewed all over Adro.”\n“Will do,” Taniel said.\n“Good luck.”\nPreparations were finished. Taniel approached Ka poel. She held her\n‑\nrucksack on one shoulder.\n“Any chance of convincing you to stay here?” Taniel said.\nKa poel planted her feet.\n‑\n“I thought not.” Taniel sighed. “Let’s go.”\nChapter 33\nAdamat returned to his home after nightfall, another day of questions\nwithout answers, of sifting sand and finding nothing of value. Another day\nof agonizing over a family he couldn’t protect and a blackmailer he had no\ndefense against. His feet hurt and his eyes wanted to close on their own.\nThe buzz of festivity in the city, the growing excitement for a festival that\nlooked to be forgotten amid war and chaos, had bolstered his spirit, but\nthere was only so much excitement a man could take before it wore him\ndown as much as the rest. He paused at the back door, examining the lock\nfor a moment by the light of the moon. He put his finger out, rubbing it over\nthe area just around the keyhole. He caught a hint of some faint smell:\nsweetbell, a Gurlish spice.\n“What is it?” SouSmith asked from behind him.\n“Nothing.” Adamat unlocked the door. They’d spent the better part of\nthe evening searching the Public Archives for the architectural plans for\nCharlemund’s villa. They’d succeeded, but the plans were old, and even\nfrom Adamat’s brief visit he knew that Charlemund had made significant\nchanges to the house since it had been built.

If caught, the consequences would be\nsevere, but he couldn’t conduct a full investigation without a thorough\nsearch.\nSouSmith went straight to the guest bedroom to change, and Adamat\nwent to his office, feeling his way through the old, familiar home without\nthe lights on. The smell of sweetbell, still very faint, was strongest in his\noffice. He opened the liquor cabinet, removing a bottle of brandy, and\npoured out three glasses. He took one of them and sat down in his chair,\nlighting a match and setting it to the end of his pipe. He took a few deep\npuffs, making sure it was lit, and breathed the smoke out through his nose.\nHe touched the match to his lantern wick.\n“I’ve had a long day,” he said. He pressed the cool glass to his forehead\nand examined the man in the corner through the slits of his eyelids.\nThe man blinked in the sudden light of the lantern, his mouth slightly\nopen. His skin, hued with an almost reddish tint, marked him from Gurla,\nwhile his pudgy face and a body flabby around the middle and soft like a\nwoman’s betrayed that he had been castrated sometime before puberty. His\nhead was shaved and he had no facial hair whatsoever.\nAdamat gestured to one of the glasses on his desk. “Drink?”\nThe eunuch had been standing in the corner, hands folded within a long-\narmed robe. He stepped forward slowly. “How did you know I was here?”\nhe asked. His voice was pitched high, like a child’s.\n“I’ve heard about you,” Adamat said. “The Proprietor’s silent killer. It’s\nsaid you can appear and vanish without a trace. I’ve been an investigator for\na very long time. Even the very best leave scratches when they pick a lock.”\n“You are being followed by a number of people,” the eunuch said.\n“Field Marshal Tamas, agents of Lord Claremonte. How did you know it\nwas me?” He sounded genuinely curious.\nAgents of Lord Claremonte? Adamat tried not to let surprise show on\nhis face. So that was Lord Vetas’s employer? “I’ve been expecting a visit\nfrom you since Tamas set me after his traitor. It had to come sooner or\nlater.”\n“You didn’t answer my question.”\nAdamat raised his glass in recognition of the question, but did not\nanswer.\nThe eunuch stepped up to the desk. He examined the glass of brandy but\ndid not drink. SouSmith entered the room in nightclothes and a dressing\ngown. SouSmith paused. Adamat noticed his fists tighten, but that was the\nonly reaction he gave to the eunuch’s presence.\n“Hello, SouSmith,” the eunuch said. He inclined his bald head toward\nthe boxer. “We haven’t seen you in the Arena for some time. We’d\nwondered when you were going to come back to us.”\nSouSmith sniffed, as a bear might when it senses a snake. “When the\nProprietor stops trying to kill me,” he said.\n“Have a drink, my friend,” Adamat said to SouSmith.\nSouSmith took his glass and retreated to the doorway to position\nhimself in the only exit. The eunuch seemed unconcerned."

    "text": "“Have a drink, my friend,” Adamat said to SouSmith.\nSouSmith took his glass and retreated to the doorway to position\nhimself in the only exit. The eunuch seemed unconcerned.\n“I presume you’ve come because of my investigation,” Adamat said.\nThe eunuch’s face took on a businesslike seriousness. “My master\ninstructs me to answer any of your questions, within reason, that will satisfy\nyou that he is not the traitor you seek.”\nAdamat considered this. He already knew why the Proprietor supported\nTamas: Part of the Accords included a Kez police force that would have\ndrastically changed the criminal underworld of Adopest—the Accords\nspecifically mentioned the Proprietor’s head in a basket. They knew he was\ntoo powerful in the criminal underworld to leave alive. Hidden identity or\nnot, the Kez would have torn Adopest apart until they found him.\nWith the danger of the Accords passed, the Proprietor might want to\npromote further chaos by removing Tamas. However, the Proprietor faced\nthe same problems as many of his fellow council members. If Tamas died,\nthen Kez was all the more likely to win the war, and the measures they\nsought to prevent in the Accords would be imposed anyway, and more\nbesides.\n“Why so forthright?” Adamat asked.\n“My master has no interest in you putting your nose into his affairs—\nyou have a certain reputation among his colleagues for unswerving\ndoggedness. However, Tamas has made it clear that having you killed will\nattract his attention in a most unpleasant way. The easiest way to go about\nthis is to get it over with.”\n“Pragmatic,” Adamat muttered. Was the Proprietor being practical, or\nwas he trying to manipulate Adamat’s investigation away from him?\nAdamat rolled the glass of brandy across his brow again. “Does the\nProprietor know who tried to have Tamas killed?”\n“No,” the eunuch said without hesitation. “He has made some inquiries\nof his own, to little avail. Whoever the traitor is, he is not using Adran\nintermediaries. My master would have known.”\n“The traitor is dealing directly with the Kez, then,” Adamat said.\n“It wasn’t the reeve,” the eunuch said. “As the funnel through which all\nmoney flows in the city, the Proprietor keeps him closely watched. Nor was\nit Lady Winceslav. We have a few agents in her household to keep an eye\non things.”\n“One of her brigadiers was involved,” Adamat said.\n“Only one,” the eunuch said. “Brigadier Barat did not have the sense of\nloyalty and justice that the others do.”\n“The vice-chancellor?”\nThe eunuch hesitated. “The vice-chancellor—Prime Lektor—is as\nunpredictable as Brude.”\nBrude. The two-faced saint of Brudania. A strange reference.\nAdamat waited for him to elaborate, but the eunuch said nothing more.\nThe reeve had also mentioned that there was something off about the vice-\nchancellor.\n“You suggest,” Adamat said, “that the Prime Lektor is equally capable\nof treachery as Ricard Tumblar and the arch-diocel?

He’s a glorified\nheadmaster.”\n“As I said,” the eunuch said quietly, “he is not what he seems.”\nAdamat took a long pull on his pipe. Assuming the eunuch was telling\nthe truth—a very dangerous assumption—the most likely traitor was Ricard\nTumblar. The arch-diocel was corrupt and power mad, but he had little\nreason to see Tamas dead. Ricard would give anything for his unions. It was\nperfectly possible he’d made a deal with the Kez in secret.\nAdamat wondered again if he should risk a clandestine search of\nCharlemund’s villa. It seemed the only thing standing before an open\naccusation against Ricard. Of course, Adamat still needed to investigate the\nvice-chancellor.\n“Thank you,” Adamat said to the eunuch. “You’ve been most helpful.\nTell your master I will avoid poking into his affairs. If I can.”\nThe eunuch gave Adamat a shallow smile. “He’ll be pleased.”\n“SouSmith, show our guest to the door.”\nSouSmith returned a moment later and took a seat on the sofa. “My skin\ncrawls,” he said.\n“Likewise.” Adamat took a deep breath, relishing the smell of fine\ntobacco. It was a cherry blend, pleasant to the nose and throat, that left a\nlight taste upon his tongue. It had a relaxing effect.\n“Do you think he’s telling the truth?” Adamat asked.\nSouSmith grunted. “Reputation for certain honesty.”\nAdamat gave SouSmith a curious look. “Really? I’ve heard the eunuch\nis not to be trusted.”\n“Not the eunuch,” SouSmith said. “When he speaks for the Proprietor,\nhis word is gold.”\n“I’ll have to take your word for it,” Adamat said, though he made a\nmental note to look into the Proprietor’s business—though not enough to\nget himself killed, hopefully.\nAdamat spent the next hour at his desk, reading the day’s paper while\nSouSmith dozed on the couch. The night was very still when he decided to\nhead to bed.\nAdamat stamped up the stairs, deep in thought, SouSmith following.\nWhen he reached the top, Adamat looked down the dark hallway. “Didn’t\nyou light the lantern when you came up?”\nSome instincts went far deeper than mere reflex. Adamat threw himself\nbackward down the stairs, barely hearing SouSmith’s protests as a breeze\npassed his throat. SouSmith swore aloud, and a pistol shot went off.\nAdamat lay flat on the stairs where he fell, his ears ringing from the\nshot. The shot had come from down the upstairs hallway. Adamat didn’t\nthink he’d been hit and he didn’t dare ask SouSmith. Adamat pressed his\nhand to his throat. He felt blood there. Just a breeze of a razor—it had\nbarely broken skin.\nAdamat listened carefully. SouSmith had fallen all the way down the\nstairs and lay at the landing. Either he had the presence of mind to remain\nquiet or he had been shot and killed outright. Adamat prayed it was the\nformer."

They’d entered his house while he was reading the paper,\npossibly through an upstairs window.\nAdamat slowly climbed to his knees, avoiding the center of the steps\nwhere they were wont to creak. He moved slowly, on hands and knees, up\nthe next few steps, until he could put his fingers out and touch the floor of\nthe hallway.\nHe explored farther, brushing his fingers along the floorboards until\nthey came in contact with something. With a feather’s touch he outlined the\nleather sides of a shoe, then another, until he had a good idea of where his\nattacker stood. He imagined the attacker’s stance. The attacker was\nprobably holding his hand up, with a razor or knife. Adamat had no way of\nknowing which hand. It was a gamble Adamat had to take.\nAdamat sprang upward. His left hand caught the attacker’s right wrist as\nhis forearm connected with the man’s throat. The attacker cried out in\nsurprise. Adamat felt something sharp graze his ear. Wrong hand!\nHe pulled down on the right hand and twisted the man around, trying to\nguess how the attacker would flail the razor with his left hand. He brought\nhis right elbow down on the man’s shoulder, eliciting a grunt. Another\npistol shot rang out, a flash of light temporarily blinding Adamat. Adamat\nfelt his attacker jerk and sag, taking the bullet that was meant for him.\nTwo of them, at least, maybe more. Adamat threw himself forward. The\npistol had gone off up the hall, near his bedroom door. He reached out\nblindly, grasping a hot pistol barrel. With the other hand he fumbled about\nhis person for the penknife he kept in his pocket. He felt a pair of palms hit\nhis chest. He was pushed backward, toward the stairs. His heel hit\nsomething—the body of the first assailant—and he went spinning head over\nfeet down the stairs.\nHe landed next to the front door. His ears rang, his head spun. Nothing\nhad broken in his tumble.\nFootsteps thumped down the stairs after him. Two figures came into the\nlight of the moon shining through the front window. One dropped his pistol\nwith a clatter on the stairs and drew something from his belt. Adamat heard\na faint click, and something glinted in the dim light.\nAdamat surged to his feet and retreated down the main hallway toward\nthe kitchen so they couldn’t come at him from above. The two men\nfollowed. One ducked into the study. The other came on fast.\nAdamat gripped his penknife. The assailant drifted forward, the only\nsound the creak of floorboards beneath his feet. Adamat felt a bit of sweat\ndrip down his brow, past his eye."

Adamat felt a bit of sweat\ndrip down his brow, past his eye.\nOne of the men lit a lamp in the study. Adamat briefly glimpsed his\nassailant’s outline. The man was of medium height, crouched low, legs\nspread for good balance. Pit, Adamat thought. The other assailant stepped\naround a corner, hooded lantern in one hand. The light shone toward\nAdamat, blinding him while giving his assailants a good look at their\nquarry. Adamat leapt forward, striking sightlessly.\nHe felt a cold sting across his chest as someone cried out. He jerked\nback with his penknife. A hand grabbed his knife arm, and he struggled\nagainst it, waiting for the familiar weakness of a deadly wound. Pain flared\nas an elbow struck his chest.\nThere was a commotion farther on in the hallway. The light spun away\nfrom Adamat’s eyes. He caught a brief glance of SouSmith, big arms\nswinging, grabbing ahold of the man with the lantern. A pistol shot rang in\nAdamat’s ears, pounding inside his head.\nAdamat managed to free his knife arm. The man with whom he\ngrappled tried to push forward, razor in hand. Adamat’s heart leapt and he\nstabbed with all his strength, praying the strike would fall true. He pulled\nback and stabbed again, and again, until the man cried out for mercy and\nslumped to the floor.\nAdamat fell against his back door and surveyed the hallway, watching\nfor any movement. He tried to control his ragged breathing, listening for\nany sign of assassins in the rest of the house.\n“All of ’em?” SouSmith mumbled.\nAdamat took a few more breaths before he answered. “I think so. One\ndead on the stairs, two down here. You hurt?”\n“Shot,” SouSmith said. “Twice. You?”\nAdamat grimaced. “I don’t know.”\nHe nudged the figure at his feet with his toe. The man gave a low moan.\nAdamat stumbled into the study, pain blossoming on his chest. He put one\nhand to it, felt it slick with blood. He bent down, every inch agony, until he\ngot ahold of the hooded lantern where it had fallen. Somehow the candle\nhad remained lit. He removed the hood.\nThe hallway was a mess. There was broken plaster on the floor in pools\nof blood. Three bodies. Adamat ignored them all and crossed to SouSmith.\nThe old boxer sat on the bottom step, one hand shoved inside his shirt. His\nfront was covered in blood.\nAdamat swallowed a lump in his throat. “Let me get more light.”\nHe lit the hallway lanterns and removed SouSmith’s shirt, borrowing a\nrazor for the job from one of the dead attackers. A bullet had grazed\nSouSmith’s left arm, taking a finger-sized chunk of flesh from it. The other\nhad entered his belly, and Adamat nearly choked when he saw the wound.\n“It’s bad?” SouSmith let his head rest against the wall. Sweat beaded\nacross his brow and cheeks. He’d tried to wipe it away at some point,\nleaving a smear of blood across his face."

He’d tried to wipe it away at some point,\nleaving a smear of blood across his face.\n“You were hit in the stomach. No way to tell whether the ball hit any\norgans. We need a surgeon. Keep your hand here, try to staunch the blood.\nI’ll try to find help.”\nHe didn’t have far to go. A number of his neighbors had heard the shots\nand stood in the street holding lanterns and pistols. They gaped at Adamat\nand tried to peer past him into his house.\n“Someone get a surgeon,” he said weakly. “And send a boy to the\nHouse of Nobles. A message for Field Marshal Tamas. Make sure he gets\nit. Tell him… tell him Adamat has been attacked by the Black Street\nBarbers.” No one ran down the street, or went to fetch a coach. Some of\nthem moved back nervously, frightened by the mere mention of a street\ngang. “Please,” Adamat said. He heard the desperation in his voice.\nOne of his neighbors stepped forward. He was an older gentleman, a\nveteran of the Gurlish wars, with long gray muttonchops and a black coat\npulled on over his nightclothes. He clutched an old blunderbuss in his\nhands. Adamat recalled his name was Tulward.\n“I’ve some surgery experience. From the field,” Tulward said. He\nturned around, shouted toward his house, “Millie! Send the boy out here.\nNow!” He turned to the group of onlookers. “Get back to your homes,\nfolks. Go!”\nAdamat nodded his thanks as Tulward stepped into his house.\n“Are you hurt?” Tulward asked. Adamat pointed to SouSmith. “He’s\nworse. Took a bullet to the stomach.”\nTulward grimaced and ran an experienced eye over the bodies. He\nstepped across them, making his way toward SouSmith.\nAdamat sighed, slumping against the wall. He took a moment to look\nlong at the carnage. One of the men was still hanging on to life, lying in the\nentrance to the study. Adamat ignored the pleading look in his eyes. The\nsecond body was at the top of the stairs. He lay on his side, shot by his own\ncomrade in an attempt to get Adamat. The bullet had entered his cheek and\nkilled him instantly, and a pool of blood trickled down the stairs.\nThe last body still stood upright, his head lodged in the wall. Adamat\nstumbled over to examine him closer. It was the one who’d been holding\nthe lantern. SouSmith had grabbed him by the face, shoving his entire head\nthrough plaster and brick.\nTulward crouched over SouSmith, talking to him quietly, fingers feeling\nalong his belly. Adamat moved over to the surviving assassin. He removed\nthe man’s coat, trying not to cause untoward pain. The man moaned.\n“I’m trying to help…” Adamat froze. He looked at the man’s face again\n—really looked, for the first time. “Coel,” he said. Ricard’s scrawny\nassistant from the docks. Adamat took a shaky breath.\nHe finished removing Coel’s coat.

The wounds were not deep,\nbut he would bleed out quickly. He rolled up Coel’s shirtsleeve, just to be\nsure. There it was, as he’d expected: a black tattoo of a barber’s razor on his\nforearm.\nCoel was long dead by the time Tamas’s soldiers arrived. The house\nswarmed with men, setting to rest Adamat’s fear that more of the Barbers\nwould come to finish the job. A team of surgeons carried SouSmith into the\nsitting room, and SouSmith’s swearing and yelling bore testament to them\ntrying to remove the bullet. Adamat sat on his stairs, watching the front\ndoor blankly as people moved in and out.\n“You might need stitches for that.”\nAdamat looked up. Tamas stood at the bottom of the stairs, one hand on\nthe railing, leaning heavily on a crutch. He reeked of gunpowder. He\nnodded at Adamat’s chest.\nAdamat looked down. The wound was superficial, but it stung like\nsomeone had squeezed a lemon into it, and it still bled.\n“When they’re done with SouSmith, I’ll take my turn.” Adamat paused.\n“You didn’t have to come yourself.”\nTamas watched him for a few moments. “The Black Street Barbers\nwere not supposed to take other jobs. Things will be very unpleasant for\nthem in the morning. You’re a very lucky man. I’ve seen the Barbers\noperate.” Tamas looked away from Adamat and at the bloodstains on the\nfloor. “It’s a pity none of them lived.”\n“Yes,” Adamat said, “I just wasn’t thinking right, assailed in the dark by\nmen with razors.” He grunted. “I won’t be able to shave for months.” He\nran his hand over his throat, where the skin had barely been broken. There\nwas a line of dried blood there. His hand trembled. A sudden impulse seized\nhim to tell Tamas all: about Lord Vetas, about his family. Maybe Tamas\nalready knew. He was not a man to be duped. Yet Tamas would not allow\nAdamat to continue his investigation if he thought Adamat’s integrity had\nbeen compromised. Adamat felt his face turn red.\nTamas didn’t seem to notice. “Who do you think ordered your death?”\nTamas said.\nIt was obvious, wasn’t it? “The Black Street Barbers are loyal to Ricard\nTumblar.” He jerked his head at Coel’s body, pushed to one side of the\nhallway. “And he was bringing Ricard wine when I met with him a month\nago.”\n“Fairly damning evidence,” Tamas said. “Any other reasons why Ricard\nwould want you dead?”\n“No,” Adamat said miserably. He remembered a time when Ricard had\nbeen imprisoned for his latest attempt at unionization some fifteen years\nprior. Adamat, already with a reputation for honesty, had given testimony\non behalf of Ricard’s character that saw him released the next day.\nTwo years after that, when Adamat was too poor to buy his children\npresents for St. Adom’s Day, Ricard had shown up at his door with gifts"

They’d leaned on each other a lot\nover the years. Adamat found it hard to believe such a friendship would end\nlike this.\n“I’ll send a squad to bring him in right now,” Tamas said. He turned to\none of his soldiers.\n“Wait,” Adamat said.\nTamas paused, turned back with a wince.\nAdamat closed his eyes. “Give me a little more time. We can’t be sure\nit’s Ricard.”\nTamas’s eyebrows rose. “The Black Street Barbers finish a job,\nInspector. This was no feint. They report to Ricard. When I’m finished with\nthem, the Barbers will not exist.”\n“They do jobs for hire,” Adamat said. It was a weak argument, even to\nhim. “I gave Ricard a chance to kill me just last week. He didn’t take it.”\nTamas gave Adamat a level stare. “If we wait even a few more hours,\nword will get to him that the assassins failed and he’ll be on a boat to Kez\nbefore sunup.”\n“Give me until noon,” Adamat said.\n“I can’t afford that.” A hint of anger entered Tamas’s voice. “If the\ntraitor gets away from me, I’ll lose my grip on the council, and they will\nturn on me.”\n“Send a squad,” Adamat said. “Have them watch Ricard—by all means,\narrest him if he tries to flee. It will be a sure sign of guilt. But if you make a\nmistake now, you’ll still have a traitor in your midst, and the Noble\nWarriors of Labor will turn against you.”\nTamas seemed to hesitate.\nAdamat said, “Give me until noon. I think I can get to the bottom of\nthis.”\n“How?”\nAdamat swallowed hard. “I’ll need to borrow one of your powder\nmages. I’m going to see the Black Street Barbers.”\nChapter 34\nThe Black Street Barbers were one of the oldest street gangs in Adopest.\nThey claimed to be between one hundred fifty and three hundred years old,\ndepending on who was asked and how drunk they were. They operated out\nof a ramshackle line of apartments only a few blocks from the Jalfast\nWaterworks. The local police guessed their number at around seventy-five.\nAdamat watched the apartments from a safe distance down the street.\nFrom the look of things, their fortunes had been better. The building was a\ndilapidated ruin. It was two stories, all of poorly made mud bricks far too\nold to be safe. The second story contained dormitories, while the first floor\nlooked to be a large bar. Chairs sat out in the sunshine in front of the\nbuilding. A number of Barbers skulked nearby, throwing dice on the\npavement while they waited for dockworkers in need of a shave.\n“Don’t like getting involved with the Barbers,” SouSmith said.\nAdamat glanced at his friend.

    "text": "Adamat glanced at his friend. SouSmith wore a short black coat, the\nsleeves rolled up. He leaned against the wall of a decommissioned coal\ncoking plant, eyeing the Barbers’ headquarters. There was a bead of sweat\nat his brow and a pain in his eyes, the only indication that he’d been shot\ntwice and operated on last night. They’d removed the lodged bullet safely.\nA lesser man would be neck deep in opiates to kill the pain.\n“I told you not to come.”\n“You paid me,” SouSmith said. “Can’t go in alone.”\nAdamat snorted. He was far from alone. SouSmith just wanted to put\nanother Barber’s head through a wall. Adamat rubbed his chest, resisting\nthe urge to pick at the stitches he’d received from Tamas’s surgeon.\nHe watched as three squads of soldiers filled the street, cutting off foot\nand carriage traffic in both directions. Another two squads fell in behind the\nBarbers’ building, unseen. One of the Barbers throwing dice looked up. He\ntapped his friend on the shoulder and pointed, then hurried inside.\n“Time to go in,” Adamat said. He pushed himself away from the wall\nand strode down the street. Tamas’s Deliv lieutenant, Sabon, appeared from\none group of soldiers. His blue uniform was immaculately pressed, his\nebony skull shaved clean. He wore a pistol on one hip, a smallsword at his\nother. He greeted Adamat with a nod.\n“Don’t let them get too close to you,” Adamat said. “They’re deadly\nwith those razors.” He waited a moment for SouSmith to catch up. Just the\nwalk up the street had turned SouSmith’s face white, and the old boxer was\nsweating as if it were midsummer. Adamat opened his mouth to send him\noff, but thought better of it. If SouSmith wanted to come, he’d come.\nAdamat felt for the pistol under his long coat to reassure himself. He\ntook his cane firmly in hand and strode toward the front door, ignoring the\npain across his chest.\nHe kicked open the front door. It fell from the hinges completely, rust\nspraying the floor. The room inside was well lit, windows open along the\neast side behind a row of barber’s chairs. There were old signs of blood\nunderneath these chairs, rusty stains on the brick floor. On the opposite side\nof the room was a long bar with bottles of liquor stacked on the wall\nbehind. There was a cask of wine at the end of the bar almost as wide as a\nman is tall.\nA group of men looked at each other and walked toward Adamat from\nthe bar. The type looked contagious: whip-lean, sickly-looking men\nwearing aprons over white shirts. Adamat addressed the one in front.\n“Hello, Teef.”\nThe man was in the process of drawing a razor from his pocket when he\nlocked eyes on Adamat’s face. His eyes went wide. He fumbled his razor,\nnearly dropping it. Adamat’s cane flicked out, catching Teef on the wrist.\nThe razor went flying.\nHis comrades didn’t recognize Adamat.

Their razors fell from their hands. Surprise crossed their faces,\nthen pain as they clutched at bleeding wrists. Three bullets had gone clean\nthrough three wrists without a pistol being drawn. Adamat dealt Teef a\nglancing blow on the cheek with the tip of his cane, then held it at the\nBarber’s neck. He looked over his shoulder. SouSmith stood just inside the\ndoor, eyes closed as he leaned heavily against the wall. Sabon stood silently\nto the side, eyes traveling around the inside of the barbershop as if he were\ncasually perusing a store. Only the cloud of powder rising from him\nindicated what he’d done.\n“What the pit?” Teef said, his voice cracking. “What are you doing? Cut\nthem down!” He glanced at his comrades, and his mouth fell open. “What\nhappened…?” His mouth worked like a fish out of the water. He stared at\nSabon, and realization spread on his face. Adamat pressed the tip of his\ncane against Teef’s throat.\n“Cut them down, eh?” Adamat said. “That what you told Coel and the\nother two you sent to kill me last night?”\n“I swear it wasn’t personal, Adamat.” Teef held his hands out in front of\nhim, glancing nervously at the space between Sabon and Adamat. His eyes\nstopped over Adamat’s shoulder. “Oh shit.”\n“They didn’t tell you SouSmith was my bodyguard, did they?” Adamat\nsaid. He smiled at the panic in Teef’s eyes. “He put one of your men’s head\nthrough a brick wall. It’ll take me hours to scrub the blood out of my front\nhall. Now, who hired you, Teef?”\n“I swear, I didn’t want to, but—”\n“It was a lot of money, I know. Must have been a king’s ransom. Tell\nme, how many times did I let you walk, back before you ran the Black\nStreet Barbers? When you were just a stupid kid with talent with a blade\nand a whole run of bad luck? I don’t appreciate favors being paid back like\nthat, Teef.” He pressed harder on Teef’s throat, and shook his head slightly\nwhen Teef tried to step back. The Barber quaked.\n“Where the pit are they?” he screamed suddenly. “Help!”\nAdamat gave Teef a long-suffering sigh. “Five squads of Tamas’s best\nsoldiers are rounding up your boys, Teef. Razors are a pretty thing in a\nclose fight, but not against seasoned riflemen with bayonets fixed.”\nGunshots went off outside the building as if to punctuate Adamat’s words.\nThere was a scramble of feet on the floor above them, then the thud of a\nbody hitting the floor.\nTeef clenched his fists, but kept them out in front of him. “We’d give\nyou a run,” he said, lip curling, “if all our boys were here, we’d give you a\npit-damned run.”\n“Sure you would,” Adamat said. “Who hired you to kill me?”\nTeef’s jaw clicked shut."

He didn’t have time for this right now.\nAdamat felt himself pushed gently aside. He lowered his cane as\nSouSmith stepped up to Teef. The boxer was at least a head taller than Teef,\nand twice as wide. Adamat bit his tongue. SouSmith was covered in a cold\nsweat, and he clenched his teeth in pain. He reached out and took one of\nTeef’s hands.\n“I’ll break this one first,” SouSmith rumbled.\n“Ricard,” Teef said. The name came out like a startled curse word.\n“Not good enough,” Adamat said.\nHe heard a snap as SouSmith bent Teef’s finger back far enough to\ntouch his wrist. Teef screamed in agony. One of the other Barbers stood up\nand reached out for Teef, only to receive SouSmith’s boot on his chest. He\nwas kicked halfway across the floor. Adamat put out a hand, steadying\nSouSmith when he stumbled. SouSmith regained his balance and twisted\nTeef’s wrist.\nThe Barber sank to the floor screaming. Adamat tapped SouSmith on\nthe shoulder with his cane. The boxer stepped back.\n“Who hired you?” Adamat said.\n“The Proprietor!” Teef squealed through a string of curses. “He came in\nhere looking for your head!”\n“At least make your lies plausible.” Adamat flicked his cane against\nTeef’s wrist. He felt a pang of pity as Teef screamed again, but forced it\ndown. Teef’s blades came to Adamat’s home, where his wife and children\nslept, and tried to kill him. His family would have been killed in their beds,\nevery one of them, if they had been there. Adamat knew how the Barbers\nworked. They were as cold and ruthless as Lord Vetas. Adamat raised his\ncane to bring it down hard.\n“A priest.”\nAdamat stopped. “A priest? Come now.”\n“It was a priest,” Teef said. He sucked in shaky breaths, chest heaving\nas he talked, tears running down his face. “He came in here yesterday\nmorning. He was crying the whole time, kept asking Kresimir for\nforgiveness.”\n“What did he look like?” Adamat asked.\n“A priest. White robes and sandals. Blond hair. A little taller than you.\nA mole on his right cheek. He wouldn’t look me in the eye.”\nSiemone. Adamat felt his mouth go dry.\n“How much?”\n“Five hundred thousand krana.”\nAdamat nearly dropped his cane. “What? For me?”\nTeef wheezed a laugh. “Two jobs. Fifteen thousand for you.”\n“And the rest?” Adamat looked around. He’d trusted it to good fortune\nthat there’d been only a few of the Barbers around. He realized now why\nthere weren’t more: They were at a job. The thought made his skin crawl.\nThat made at least forty Barbers unaccounted for, maybe more.\nSabon stepped forward and dragged Teef to his feet by the front of his\nshirt. “Is it Tamas?” Sabon said.

My\nemployer wanted him cut down in public. We don’t normally do that, but\nfor the amount he offered…” Teef trailed off.\nSabon dropped him. Teef tried to catch himself, called out in pain.\nSabon gave him a look of disgust. “You’ve made a terrible mistake,” he\nsaid. He glanced at Adamat. “Take them to Sabletooth. I have to go.”\nSabon was gone without another word, and Adamat saw that it was now\njust he, SouSmith, and the four Barbers. He exchanged a glance with\nSouSmith. The boxer shrugged. Adamat lifted Teef’s chin with the tip of\nhis cane. “What’s so important about a chef?” he asked. Mihali, he recalled\nthe chef’s name. Had the arch-diocel remembered the beating Mihali gave\nhim in Tamas’s presence? It was a lot of money for revenge.\nTeef shook his head. Adamat moved his cane threateningly. Teef’s head\nshake was more emphatic. “I don’t know, Kresimir damn you! It was just a\njob.”\n“And you have no idea where the money came from?” Charlemund.\nSiemone wouldn’t do dirty work for anyone else. Charlemund had been\ntrying to frame Ricard all along.\nTeef hesitated just a second too long.\n“I suggest you remain ignorant,” Adamat said. “Or your fate will be\nworse than it already is.” Tamas would destroy Teef. Adamat almost pitied\nthe Barber. Almost. He stepped away from Teef as a troop of soldiers\nentered the room. “Get them to Sabletooth,” Adamat said. “All of them. I\nhave to go to find the field marshal.”\n“It’ll take hours to get across the city with the festival on,” SouSmith\nshouted after him.\nAdamat barely heard as he ran out of the building. He needed to tell\nTamas about Charlemund before it was too late.\nChapter 35\nTaniel’s chest heaved, his legs ached. A few short hours of rest just before\ndawn was all they’d taken in the last two days. Only his powder trance let\nhim keep the pace, but he always found himself outdistancing his\ncompanions. Two of the Watchers had collapsed from exhaustion. They left\nthem where they were and continued on. Those men would find their own\nway back down the mountain.\nThe going was easier than Taniel’s last ascent. Some snow had melted,\nthe rest had been cleared by the Mountainwatch.

They’d yet to catch sight of the Kez, but they’d found two camps.\nThere was scat and tracks enough for at least a hundred men and pack\nanimals to boot. That many men shouldn’t have been able to sneak past the\nMountainwatch, yet somehow they had.\nThey found the third camp midday. It was tucked away off the main\ntrail, down by a waterfall that was still half-frozen despite summer being\nalmost upon them. Taniel checked the ashes of a cook fire. They were still\nwarm.\nHe took stock of the camp. It brought back memories of camps not so\nunlike this in faraway Fatrasta when he and the natives tracked Kez patrols\nand lay ambushes for them. Only that hadn’t been in the high mountains,\nand those patrols weren’t filled with Privileged. And Wardens.\nHis chest went cold as he kicked something with his toe. He picked it\nup, flipped it around in his hand. It was a metal ball just about the size of a\nman’s fist. An air reservoir from a Warden’s air rifle.\n“How far behind them?” Bo asked when the rest of the group had\ncaught up to Taniel. Bo looked less well each day. His cheeks were sunken,\nhis eyes underlined by black bags. Their punishing pace had done him ill.\n“Hours,” Taniel said. He tossed Bo the air reservoir. “I should have\nexpected this.”\n“Where there are Kez Privileged, there are Wardens,” Bo said.\nHe dropped the metal sphere, only to have Ka poel swoop in and pluck\n‑\nit from the ground. She examined it closely and tucked it into her rucksack.\n“We’re gaining on them,” Taniel said.\n“Close to the top, too,” Bo replied. “We’re not far from Novi’s Perch.”\n“Everyone rested?” Taniel asked Fesnik. The young Watcher staggered\nto the waterfall to refill his canteen.\nFesnik groaned. “Pit, no. We supposed to be able to fight after a climb\nlike this?”\n“Fight and win,” Taniel said. He nudged Fesnik with his toe.\n“Right, right,” Fesnik said. He climbed to his feet. “Come on,” he called\nto the others. “We’re moving again.”\nTaniel watched them head back to the main trail. These were hard men,\nMountainwatchers. Yet none had his advantage with the powder, and even\nhe felt sapped from the climb. What good would they do against Julene and\nthe other Privileged? How could they possibly win a fight?\nTaniel fell in beside Ka poel on the trail. She held a blank-faced wax\n‑\nfigurine, pushing and shaping the wax with her fingers.\n“What are you doing?” he asked her.\nShe tucked the doll under one arm. Expecting an explanation of hand\nsigns, Taniel leaned closer. She punched him in the shoulder.\n“Ow.”\nShe shooed him away with one hand and returned to her project. He fell\nback beside Bo.\nBo looked troubled.\n“You seem cheery,” Taniel said. Bo’s expression didn’t change. The\nsarcasm seemed lost on him.\n“We might be too late,” Bo said."

The\nsarcasm seemed lost on him.\n“We might be too late,” Bo said.\n“We’re making better time than I expected.”\n“We have to be there during the solstice.”\n“Don’t worry,” Taniel said. “We will.” Taniel spotted smoke in the sky.\nHe grabbed Bo’s shoulder and pointed.\n“Is that the mountain?” Taniel said. He couldn’t remember being able to\nsee the smoking crater from here on his last journey up.\nBo paled. “No,” he said. “Too close. That’s Novi’s Perch.”\nWord spread and they redoubled their efforts. They reached the Perch\nwithin an hour.\nThe wall of the monastery that effectively ended this portion of the trail\nhad been smashed in. It looked like a giant had stepped up to the side of the\nmountain and simply slapped it with the flat of his hand. Some of the old\nrock remained where it met the mountain. The rest had fallen away into the\nabyss and was invisible against the stone of the gulch far, far below. The\nmonastery was exposed like the side of a dollhouse, hallways and stairs\nbare to the elements.\nThe ruins lay like a smoking animal carcass, splintered timbers jutting\nout from the rubble like broken ribs. In some places the rock itself had\nmelted away. The invisible fist that had destroyed a great part of the\nmonastery had also destroyed a chunk of the cliff, and the hallway that led\nfrom one end of the monastery to the other was now divided by a fissure\ntwenty paces across.\n“We can go back, and head down one of the halls,” Fesnik said.\n“There’s a warren inside the mountain—that’s where the rest of the\nmonastery is. Shouldn’t take but a few minutes.” His voice was quiet,\nalmost reverent. He gazed about with a look of sadness. Taniel realized that\nthe Watchers must have known these monks.\nThey found the hallways just as Fesnik had said. Once they were inside\nthe mountain, the smoke got worse. They could barely breathe as they made\ntheir way through the crisscross of hallways. Rina’s dogs whined despite\nher rebukes. Taniel paused by one wall, noting a splatter of blood. An odd\nchip had been made in the stone. He ran his fingers over it. From a bullet,\nfor certain.\n“There’s no bodies,” Taniel said quietly. He spoke mostly to himself,\nbut was surprised to find Ka poel very close to him. She examined the ruins\n‑\nclinically. Taniel said, “There have to be survivors. The smoke would drive\nthem out. They must be on the other side.” He nodded to himself. “That’s\nit.” Taniel felt ill.\nKa poel gave him a look that seemed to say she doubted this.\n‑\nThey came out of the hallway on the other side of the fissure. He could\nsee where the monastery ended, and the broken stairways that led up to the\nopposite entrance. No one was to be seen.\n“Please,” a voice said.\nTaniel leapt into the air. He spun around, pistol out before he could\nprocess a thought. He lowered the pistol."

He lowered the pistol.\nA monk shied away from him. It was a woman, much younger than he\nexpected.\n“I’m sorry,” he said. The sight of her made his hands shake. Her face\nwas bruised, battered. Blood stained her robe. “Are there more survivors?”\nThe woman indicated one of the many hallways. Thirty paces in, as far out\nof the elements as they could manage, was a ragtag group. The smoke wasn’t\ntoo bad here. There were seven that Taniel could see still standing, and a large\nnumber of linen-wrapped bodies on the floor. His heart fell as he counted\nthose bodies. He stopped at forty, and that couldn’t have been half.\nFesnik spoke to one of the monks, an old man, his gown torn and dirty,\nhis eyebrows singed. Taniel approached.\n“We gave them the best fight we could,” the old man said. He\nbrandished his walking stick. “They came out of nowhere. We should have\nbeen better prepared. Had there not been so many…”\nTaniel knew the monastery would still have been destroyed. What could\na bunch of monks do against half of the Kez Cabal, and Julene on top of\nthat? She stormed through, slaughtering as she went. What could Taniel and\nBo hope to do against her?\nThe man went on, “That was two hours ago. The fight was fast, violent.\nI’ve never seen anything like it. Some of the younger ones can’t even\nbelieve it happened.” He gestured to a young monk who sat near the wall,\narms wrapped around himself. He was in shock, eyes staring out at nothing.\n“Del hasn’t spoken since it happened. Still, we made a good accounting.”\nTaniel could barely hold back his bewilderment. “A good accounting?”\nThe old monk’s face was serious but proud. “Well, yes. Half these\nbodies are theirs.”\nTaniel looked around. He then saw what he hadn’t before—a stack of\nair rifles in the corner. He realized that many of the bodies were big, bigger\nthan any man should be. Fifteen, twenty. Wardens. Then there, near a small\nfire one of the monks was using for warmth, he saw the frayed corner of a\nPrivileged’s glove and a Kez uniform. Taniel felt awed. This small group of\nmonks had not only stood their ground against the Kez Cabal, they’d given\nas good as they got.\nThere had to be sorcery at play here. Powerful stuff. Not anymore. He\nwondered if there were more monks farther in the monastery. No, probably\nnot. This looked like it. A meager handful of survivors. Yet they managed\nto fight Wardens and Privileged.\n“Why’d they leave you alive?” Taniel asked as gently as he could.\nThe old man tightened a bandage around his wrist. “Seemed in a hurry.”\n“The solstice,” Bo said, appearing at Taniel’s shoulder.\nThe monk barely blinked, his face revealing nothing. “There are old\nmagics,” he said quietly.\n“They were led by a woman?” Taniel asked. “Regal, looks about thirty-"

There were a lot of bodies here. They may\nhave wiped out a good chunk of the Kez. Mostly Wardens, it seemed. He\ngave Bo a glance. Bo was examining the wrapped bodies and moving\namong the survivors. His fingers twitched in his gloved hands. He’d love to\nknow what kinds of sorceries these monks were hiding. Taniel guessed that\nnot even the cabals knew all the old secrets.\nBo returned to the old monk. “This monastery. It was put here to guard\nagainst something.”\nThe monk’s face remained neutral.\n“Against Kresimir’s return?”\n“Nothing good will come of the god returning,” the old man said. “But\nthere are worse things on this mountain.” He paused. “Yes, we are the\ngatekeepers of Kresim Kurga. The Predeii have returned. We were meant to\nstop them.” His proud countenance faltered. “We failed.”\n“We’ll do what we can,” Bo said.\nTaniel gave what he hoped was a confident nod.\nThey stepped away from the old monk and put their heads together.\n“He knows a lot more than he’s letting on,” Bo said.\n“We don’t have time to interrogate him.”\nBo rubbed his gloved hands together. “I’d make it quick. It might be\nvaluable.” His eyes glowed with curiosity, and his face was more alive than\nTaniel had seen in weeks.\n“No,” Taniel said. “Look around. He wants Julene dead. He would have\ntold us anything he knew. God, they really do make you sell your soul to\njoin the cabal, don’t they?”\n“Expediency.”\n“We have to go,” Taniel said. “The solstice?”\n“Today.”\n“How long will it take to get to the peak?”\n“Longer than it is until the solstice.”\n“We’ll have to beat it,” Taniel said. “Do we have a plan?”\nBo frowned. “There are plenty of Privileged among these dead,” he\nsaid. “Maybe enough to ruin her plans. She needs power to summon\nKresimir. She needs to bridge great distances to bring him back.” Bo\nseemed to consider his options for a moment. “Take out as many Privileged\nas we can. Ignore Julene.”\n“She’ll be hard to ignore when we’ve made her angry.”\nBo sighed. “We’ll deal with that when we come to it.”\nTaniel returned to the old monk. The man was kneeling next to the other\nhe’d called Del, and was speaking quietly into his ear. He looked up.\n“You’ll need a guide in the city,” he said. “There are dangerous paths\nup there. Del knows the way best. I’m trying to coax him up…”"

He touched gloved\nfingers to the man’s forehead and held his other hand up. He touched the air\ngently—a pianist performing a song with one hand.\n“Yes,” Del suddenly said. The word came out as a hiss. “I’ll go.” This\nwas a croak. His eyes came awake, like a fire coming to life in a dark\nhearth.\n“Are you all right?” Bo asked.\n“Water.”\n“Get him some water,” Taniel told the old monk. He was back in a\nmoment, and they tended to Del before helping him to his feet.\n“I’ll be all right,” Del said. “I’ll go. You… you say you can stop them?”\n“We’ll try,” Bo said.\n“We have to get to Kresim Kurga before the solstice.”\n“Do you know where they’ll be?” Taniel asked.\nDel frowned up at the sky. “There is a coliseum there, built by Kresimir.\nIt helps focus sorcery. I think that is the most likely place.”\n“Excellent,” Taniel said. He pulled Bo to one side. “What did you do to\nwake him up?”\n“Nothing,” Bo said. “I was going to touch his mind, see if there was\nanything there, but he came awake before I did.”\n“It’ll be good to have a guide.”\nBo agreed.\nTaniel stepped away. A pair of Watchers pulled a body from farther in\nthe smoke-filled hallway—an old woman. She had not a mark on her. She\nmight have died in her bed, killed by the smoke, too deep in the mountain to\nhear the battle. The Watchers left her body with the monks and turned back\nto search for more.\n“We need to go,” Taniel said. He kept his voice gentle, but loud enough\nfor the others to hear. “Fesnik,” he said. “Gather the men.”\nFesnik had been helping wrap yet another body. He stood up, cast a\nweary look about him. He seemed to have realized what they were up\nagainst. This wasn’t an adventure. This was a chase to the death against\nopponents far more powerful than they.\nBo was arguing with the old monk when Taniel returned to them.\n“You can’t bury them all,” Bo said.\n“It’s our way,” the old monk replied. His face was, as always, neutral.\n“Toss the Kez over the cliff. Tend to your own if you can’t leave them\npacked in ice for a few weeks. You need to get down the mountain and tell\nGavril what happened.”\n“We’ll send someone,” the old monk said.\nBo sneered at the old man. “And your own survival? The monastery is\ndestroyed. The nights are cold enough to freeze anything left outdoors. This\nis no home for you now!” His voice began to rise, and his gestures were\nmaking Taniel nervous.\n“Bo,” Taniel said.\n“What?” Bo whirled on him.\n“Time to go.”\nBo took a deep breath and collected himself. “Take care,” he said to the"

There was a hint of sarcasm in his voice. “Stubborn bastard,” he\nmuttered as he passed Taniel.\n“Your friend is very tired,” the old monk said.\n“He’s had a rough month.”\n“He has very little left.”\nTaniel scowled. These monks were a mystery. What kind of sorcery did\nthey have at their call to have been able to fight Julene and the Kez Cabal?\nHe didn’t see any Privileged’s gloves on any of them. He opened his third\neye, fighting the nausea. He closed it again as quickly as he could and tried\nto blink away the blinding colors of the Else. The sorcery was too thick to\nmake out anything.\n“I know,” Taniel said. “Find some shelter.”\n“Good luck,” the old monk said. He managed a smile, something for\nwhich Taniel found himself more grateful than he expected. “We gave them\na good fight,” the old monk said. “They are weaker now. Make it count.”\nIf these old men and women could fight Julene, then so could he, Taniel\ndecided. He took a deep breath and clenched his fist. It was time to take the\nfight after her.\nTaniel clasped hands with the old monk and joined the waiting\nWatchers. They’d done what they could for the surviving monks. Some of\nthe Watchers left their rations and spare blankets—though Taniel hoped the\nmonks would be able to scrounge more from the ruins when the smoke died\ndown.\nTaniel did a head count and noticed Rina and her dogs were missing.\nThey found her at the end of the monastery squatting just outside the\nbroken walls, examining the path up to the peak. She turned to face them as\nthey approached. Her dogs whined and pulled at their harnesses. She\nsilenced them with a hiss, but only for a moment.\n“There’s something else on this mountain,” she said.\nTaniel tried not to shiver. “What do you mean?”\n“Cave lions.” She indicated the ground, pointing to tracks that Taniel\ncould barely see. “We’ve hunted them before. The dogs know their scent.”\nTaniel felt relief wash over him. There’d been something so sinister\nabout her statement. He realized his hands were shaking. “Oh,” he said.\n“There’s lions on all the mountains. That could even be Julene—the monks\nsaid she used that form when she fell among them.”\n“I don’t think that’s it.”\nTaniel felt his heart beat a little faster. “Pole!” he called. “Get back\nhere.”\nThe girl had gone on ahead, some thirty paces, and was squatting on the\ntrail, picking at the ground. She ignored him.\n“No?” Taniel asked Rina. “How can you know?”\nRina spread her hands and spoke in her ever-quiet voice. “Because\nthere’s at least fifty.”\nTaniel heard more than one of the Watchers swear. Bo sputtered,\nmaking warding signs in the air with his hands.\n“What?” Taniel said. The word came out more forceful than he’d\nintended."

They came\n‑\ndown off the slope and fell in behind the Kez.”\nTaniel glanced at Bo. “Can she summon them?” he asked. “I’ve heard\nstories about Privileged who can—”\nHe was interrupted by Rina’s laugh.\n“What?”\n“They’re not with the Kez,” she said. “They’re hunting them.” There\nwas a note of hysteria to her quiet voice. “They’ll hunt us too when we go\nup there. Kresimir above, they’ll hunt us.” She pulled the dogs closer to her\nand stared at the tracks on the ground.\n“Cave lions don’t hunt in packs,” one of the Watchers said.\nThey all seemed to turn to Bo at once. He looked back at them, his face\ntired and haggard. He felt the air tentatively with gloved hands like a doctor\nfeeling for a broken bone under the skin, a warm thread of sorcery touching\nTaniel’s senses.\nAll he said was, “There’s something wrong on this mountain.”\nNila acquired a cart for the laundry. One of the many workmen attending\nthe St. Adom’s Day Festival helped her build it out of an old washtub and\nthe base of a four-wheeled vendor’s wagon. She couldn’t bring herself to\nask one of the guards, though they’d likely do it without protest. Word had\nspread that she’d rejected Olem. The soldiers were still courteous, but not\nlike they’d been.\nFor three days she used her new cart to collect the laundry, so that the\nguards would get used to the idea. It made sense—she had more work to do\nthan usual, what with half the staff of the House of Nobles skipping out on\ntheir duties to attend Mihali’s feast. The lack of help left her alone in the\nbasement to do the laundry more often than not, and she was able to amend\nher usual route to pass down the hallway to Jakob’s room.\nNila quickly realized that night would be the hardest time to sneak\nJakob out of the building. With the halls deserted, it would be difficult to\nhide him. During the day, however, the number of people in the House of\nNobles was almost overwhelming. The feast going on outside made it\nimpossible to keep track of everyone who came and went, and once out of\nthe building she’d be able to melt into the crowd.\nOn the morning of the final day of the festival she wheeled her clothing\ncart down the halls of the House of Nobles. She made her usual stops and\ncollected enough clothes that she’d be able to conceal a child, before\nturning down the hallway to Jakob’s room. She passed men and women,\nsoldiers and clerks, nodding and smiling to everyone.\nThe guard wasn’t at his station. Nila gave a sigh and whispered a prayer\nof gratitude to Kresimir. Only Jakob’s nurse would stand between getting\nthe boy to freedom.\nNila checked to make sure her truncheon was still in her cart. She didn’t\nwant to use it, but she would if the nurse gave her trouble."

The door to Jakob’s room stood open. It\nwas never open. She forced herself to continue on, wheeling her cart past\nthe door, glancing inside as casually as she could.\nThe room was empty. No nurse. No Jakob. Had she made a mistake?\nDid they move Jakob to another room this morning, or even out of the\ncountry?\nShe checked the hallway for soldiers and went inside.\nThe bed was unmade. There were toys on the bedside table, and a\nchild’s clothes hanging in the closet. It looked like he’d left only recently.\nWas he using the washroom? She needed to get out, in case he came back\nwith a guard.\n“Who the pit are you?” a male voice asked.\nNila spun around, her heart leaping into her throat. Two men stood in\nthe doorway. The one who spoke looked like a dockworker, with a flat cap\nand a wool jacket with mended elbows over a grimy brown vest. The other\nwas obviously a gentleman. He wore a black jacket over a velvet vest and\nwhite shirt, black pants, and black, polished shoes. He carried a cane and\ntop hat.\n“The laundress,” Nila said, swallowing hard. Who were these men?\nWhy were they in Jakob’s room?\nThe dockworker frowned at her, then looked back at the clothing cart in\nthe hallway. “Come back later,” he said.\n“Can I help you with something?” Nila asked. She could tell by the\ndockworker’s accent that he was a local. Probably a member of the Noble\nWarriors of Labor. The gentleman remained silent, but something about his\nsteady stare put Nila on edge.\n“Just came back for the boy’s clothes and toys,” the dockworker said.\n“Won’t take but a minute.”\n“I was just about to take them for laundering. I could get them cleaned\nand then send them after.”\n“That won’t be necessary.” The gentleman finally spoke. His voice was\nquiet, steady. He sounded educated. “Go on,” he told the dockworker.\nThe dockworker pushed past Nila, politely but firmly, and began\nemptying the closet and the dresser drawers onto the bed. He tossed a\nwooden train and a pair of tin soldiers on the pile and gathered it all up in\none of the sheets, tying it in a knot at the top.\n“I’m sure he has a travel bag…” Nila began.\n“That won’t be necessary,” the gentleman said again. “You may take\ncare of the rest of the bedding.” He left the room.\nThe dockworker swung the whole bundle over his shoulder and carried\nit out into the hallway. Nila followed him, watching him head down the\nhallway behind the gentleman. When neither turned to look back at her, she\nbegan pushing her cart after him.\nShe followed them at a distance down the main hallway, then down a\nside corridor before they turned into a room at the end of the hall: one of the\nmany offices in the building.

Someone gripped her by the chin,\nand she found herself staring into the compassionless eyes of the\ngentleman.\n“What does the boy mean to you?” he asked. His voice was still calm,\ncollected, despite the bruising grip he had on Nila.\nNila mumbled in surprise, not certain as to what to say. Who was this\nman? Why would he treat her like this? How could he know Jakob meant\nanything to her?\n“What,” the gentleman said, jerking her face from one side to the other\nwith emphasis on each word, “does the boy mean to you?”\n“Nothing. I’m just the laundress.”\n“I have a Knack for knowing when I’m being lied to,” he said. “You\nhave five seconds to tell me. Then I will strangle you.”\nNila felt his fingers close around her throat. She stared back into his\neyes. She’d seen more life in the eyes of dead men. She counted down in\nher head. His grip tightened.\n“I was…” she started, feeling her throat constrict. He let up slightly. “I\nwas his family’s laundress before the purge. I’ve known him since birth. I\nwanted to help him escape from Tamas.”\nThe fingers dropped from her throat. “Fortunate,” the gentleman said.\n“We had problems with his nurse. You will take her place and come with\nus.”\n“I don’t…”\nHe grabbed her by the back of the neck, half dragging her across the\nroom as one might an unruly child. He opened a closet and forced her to\nlook down.\nNila remembered the nurse who’d been watching Jakob when Olem had\ntaken her to see him. She was an older woman, heavyset. She lay at the\nbottom of the closet unnaturally, her eyes staring up at nothing. Nila tried to\nback away. The gentleman’s grip on her neck prevented her from doing so.\n“This,” the gentleman said, “happened because she had qualms. If you\ndecide to have qualms… if you ever disobey me… I will not hesitate to kill\nyou with my bare hands. My name is Lord Vetas, and I am your master\nnow. Follow me.”\nHe closed the closet door and led her out into the hall. The dockworker\nappeared with the sack of Jakob’s clothing over his shoulder. Vetas\ngestured to Nila. “She will be the boy’s new nurse. Take her. I have\nbusiness to attend to elsewhere.”\nVetas left at a brisk pace. Nila couldn’t help but watch him go. Her\nheart hammered in her chest, her legs sagging beneath her. She’d never felt\nfear like this. Not before Olem had saved her from rape, not when she’d\nalmost drowned as a child in the Adsea. That man was pure malice.\nThe dockworker shrugged and took Nila by one arm.

She could\nkick him and get away, disappearing into the throng.\nThey drew closer to the carriage. Some dread in the pit of her stomach\ntold her that if she set foot in that carriage, she would never escape Lord\nVetas. She watched for an opportunity, her body tensed, her skirt gathered\nin one hand so that she could run.\n“Miss Nila?” Jakob appeared in the door of the carriage. His hair was\nmussed, his jacket askew, but he seemed unhurt. “Miss Nila! I didn’t know\nyou were here!”\nNila let her skirt fall from her hand. She took Jakob’s hand and stepped\ninto the carriage. “Don’t worry,” Nila said. “I’ve come to take care of you.”\nChapter 36\nTamas leaned back in his chair, one leg up on a hassock, and watched\nMihali’s feast draw what seemed like half the city for a late breakfast. The\nentire square was full, and the streets beyond overflowing with lines\nwaiting their turn. Some of them watched jugglers while they waited, and\nthousands crowded around a raised platform near the middle of the square,\neating porridge on their feet as a troupe of mummers performed a lewd\ncomedy. This was the last day of the festival, and no expense had been\nspared for the entertainment of the masses.\nA large parasol shaded Tamas from the midmorning sun. He sat on the\nfront step of the House of Nobles, feeling better than he had for months,\nwhile he worked his way through a basket of rolls Mihali had left with him\nan hour ago.\n“With your leg, you should be in bed,” Lady Winceslav said. “Are you\nsure you’re feeling well enough to be out?”\nHe looked her over once, noting her pallor, and wondered if he should\nask the same.\n“Of course, Lady. Never better.” Brave words, maybe, but the fact was\nhis leg did feel better. He could almost feel it healing, his strength returning\nto him. He knew he had work to do, but damn it, none of it seemed to\nmatter. For the first time since his wife’s death, he felt whole again.\nEven Lady Winceslav seemed in better spirits. She’d braved the crowds\ndespite her recent scandal with Brigadier Barat. She wasn’t directing the\nfestival—that was all in Mihali’s hands now—but at least she was here.\n“Do you think everyone will come?” she asked.\nTamas eyed the crowd. “I think the whole city is here, Lady.”\n“I meant of the council.” She gave him a playful cuff on the arm.\n“Ricard has been here since half past six,” Tamas said, “rolling out food\nand wine with the rest of his workers.” And under strict, but discreet, watch,\nuntil Adamat returned with evidence for or against his guilt. If the union\nboss knew anything about the attempt on Adamat’s life, he gave no sign.\n“Has he?” She seemed surprised by this. “Incredible.”\n“Ondraus is somewhere out there, yelling at his clerks,” Tamas said."

Of Charlemund I haven’t\nseen hide or hair. And there”—he pointed—“is the vice-chancellor.”\nTamas watched Prime Lektor pick his way through the crowd. The\nbirthmark spidering across his face looked darker than usual. The vice-\nchancellor eyed the food as he passed the serving tables, but he seemed to\nhave something more important on his mind. He paused briefly at a stern\nlook from Tamas’s bodyguards and then ducked under the parasol. He\ntipped his hat to Lady Winceslav.\n“Seat?” Tamas asked, gesturing to one of the guards.\n“Please,” Prime said. He observed the feast while waiting for a chair,\nand then took a seat next to Tamas. “You seem to be in unusually good\nspirits.”\n“I do?” Tamas said. “I haven’t said two words.”\nPrime cleared his throat. “I can sense it about you. It’s in the air. Like a\nfirst-year student who knows he’s going to be every professor’s favorite.\nIt’s annoying.” Prime looked about again. He kept looking toward the\nserving tables and watching assistants bring out bowls and platters and\neverything else.\nTamas gave the vice-chancellor a sidelong glance. “Can’t you feel it?”\nhe said. “It’s not just me. It’s the whole city. It’s… this.” He gestured to the\nfeast, the tens of thousands gorging themselves on Mihali’s food without a\ncare in the world. “The wealthy and the poor, the noble and the ignoble\nrubbing shoulders. I’ve never seen anything like it.”\nPrime gave the feast a long-suffering once-over. “You don’t believe this\nrubbish, do you?” he said. “About this chef being a god?” His eyes lingered\non a pot of porridge.\nTamas hesitated, trying to read Prime’s tone. There was something off\nabout it. Despite the gruff way he spoke, it almost sounded as if Prime\nwanted Tamas to say yes.\n“Ha. A god? No. A powerful Knacked. A little mad, maybe. But\nharmless,” Tamas said. “But then again…” He raised a finger alongside his\nnose in a secretive gesture. “What does a god look like? What does a god\ndo? Who am I to know one when I see him?” He shook his head with a\nlaugh at Prime’s exasperated look. “Mihali is a gifted man. Greatly so. I\ndon’t think a god, though. How about you? You’re probably the most\nqualified to know. You’ve every history of the Nine at your fingertips. Do\nany talk of Adom?”\n“I realized a long time ago Kresimir would never return.” Prime fell\nquiet, and Tamas realized he had no idea how old the vice-chancellor was.\n“And Adom…” Tamas prompted.\n“He loved his food,” Prime admitted. “He’s the patron saint of chefs for\na reason.

He was a big man, strong, powerful, and”—he tracked one of\nMihali’s female assistants with his eyes as she passed by, a platter of\nstuffed waterfowl balanced on one hand—“he was very popular with the\nwomen. He had over four hundred wives, and loved every one of them.\nFiguratively and literally.”\n“Four hundred?” Tamas said. “I could barely handle one.” His throat\ncaught on that, and he had to clear it. “You speak as if you knew him\nyourself.”\nPrime said nothing.\n“Sounds like Mihali is a pretty good candidate.”\n“There are too many questions,” Prime said. “There hasn’t been a god\non this earth for hundreds and hundreds of years. Kresimir left, off to\nresume his exploration of the cosmos. Novi and Brude went the same way\njust days after. The rest followed, or disappeared without fanfare. There\nwas a rumor that one or two of them had remained behind… ,” he said,\ntrailing off.\nTamas exchanged a curious look with Lady Winceslav.\n“Do you feel well?” Tamas asked.\nPrime spared him a glance. “Would you believe me,” he said, “if I told\nyou Mihali is a gifted sorcerer?”\n“Without a doubt. Not a Privileged, though. A Knacked.”\nPrime snorted. “A Knacked, my ass. What if I were to say, ‘the most\npowerful sorcerer in the world’? Or if I said that that’s all the gods ever\nwere: immensely powerful sorcerers?”\n“Hypothetically?” Tamas said, revealing his skepticism.\n“The most powerful to ever live?”\n“You’re joking.”\n“It’s just a question,” Prime snapped.\n“So what if he was?”\n“The problem with logic,” Prime said, “is that sometimes you are forced\nto believe your own hypothesis, even if you don’t want to. What do you feel\nwhen you sense toward Mihali?”\n“A Knacked, as I said. He has the soft glow to him. Less power than a\nPrivileged by far.”\n“Can you be sure?”\nTamas sighed. He opened his third eye and looked toward Mihali. There\nhad to be many Knacked in such a large crowd, but Mihali was easy to find.\nSomething about him stood out above the others. Yet his glow was no\nstronger.\n“Yes,” Tamas said. He watched Prime’s face. The old man was\nfrowning toward Mihali. “You don’t think it’s possible, do you? That he’s\nreally a god?”\nPrime closed his eyes and was quiet for several minutes. Tamas was\nbeginning to wonder whether the old man had nodded off, when his eyes\nopened.\n“Too many questions,” he said again.\n“You said ‘the other gods,’” Tamas said, “I thought Kresimir was the\nonly god.”\nPrime shifted in his chair and watched a service-pressed clerk roll out a\nbarrel of ale and gingerly move it down the front steps. “That’s not\nprecisely true,” Prime said.\n“It’s dogma,” Tamas said. “Charlemund reminded me so just the other\nday.”"

    "text": "precisely true,” Prime said.\n“It’s dogma,” Tamas said. “Charlemund reminded me so just the other\nday.”\n“Just because something is church dogma does not make it true.”\n“Well, certainly,” Tamas said, “any educated man…” He trailed off at\nPrime’s scowl.\n“Educated men,” Prime said. “Bah. There were ten gods. Not one god\nand nine saints. Kresimir came initially, and then requested the help of his\nbrothers and sisters to organize the Nine.”\n“There’s ten gods?” Tamas said. He struggled to remember his history\nlessons. “I always thought Kez took Kresimir as their patron. Who is the\ntenth, then?”\nPrime shook his head. “That’s the wrong question. You should be\nasking: If Mihali is a god, why is he here now?”\nSouth Pike Mountain was hidden behind the House of Nobles, but they\nboth turned in that direction. Tamas thought back to the warnings he’d\nreceived from Bo and Taniel. Ancient sorcerers trying to summon God. It\nwas almost quaint, as if from a storybook. Fears generated from the stress\nof months of battle. Although, Tamas remembered, those first warnings\ncame before the start of the siege. Tamas scratched at the top of his\nwounded leg. It began to hurt more, the pain returning like an ache long\nthought gone.\n“Have you ever heard of Kresimir’s Promise?” Tamas said suddenly.\n“Rubbish,” Prime said.\n“Rubbish? You know of it? I was told it was a cabal secret, only known\nto the kings and their Privileged.”\n“It is.” Prime mopped his forehead with a handkerchief.\nTamas was about to press him more when he heard a scream.\nAnother followed, and then another. A ripple of fear moved through the\nlarge crowd as a murmur of yells grew to a roar in moments. People rose\nfrom their places, their food forgotten, trying to see the source of the\ncommotion.\n“What’s going on?” Tamas snatched his crutch and struggled from his\nchair. “Find out what’s going on,” he told a guard. “Get inside,” he said to\nPrime. “Guards, take Lady Winceslav inside.” Tamas watched Mihali climb\nup onto a table, nimble despite his girth, and strain to see what was\nhappening.\n“Calm down!” Mihali shouted. His voice carried over the crowd with\nsurprising force. “Please, return to your seats.” People paused, half-risen,\nunsure of what to do. Those in line seemed to hesitate, unwilling to lose\ntheir places but concerned by what could be happening. Everyone\nremembered the dragoons on Election Day.\nTamas could still see nothing. The commotion seemed to be coming\nfrom the far end of the tables. Some people ran, struggling against those\nwho tried to get closer and see.\n“My pistol,” Tamas said. He noticed Prime had gotten to his feet and\nwas craning his neck for a better look. Lady Winceslav waited beside the\ndoor to the House of Nobles with her bodyguard.\n“Get inside,” Tamas said again. “I don’t want you killed by a fear-\nstricken mob.”\nPrime ignored him."

He checked that it was primed and loaded before scanning the\ncrowd.\n“There,” Prime said, pointing.\nTamas caught sight of a man several hundred paces away. The crowd\nhad backed away from him. He looked to be holding something in his hand.\nTamas bit into a powder charge and swayed as the full force of a powder\ntrance hit him. He took a few shallow breaths and straightened, sharpening\nhis gaze on the man.\nThe man was dressed as a Barber. He wore a white shirt and dark pants\nunder a white apron. The apron itself was stained with blood. There was a\nbody at his feet, with the long, blond hair of a woman. He wiped the blade\nof his razor on his apron and sprinted toward the crowd.\n“The Black Street Barbers,” Tamas said slowly. “What the pit…”\nMore screams. Tamas swiveled his gaze. There were dozens of them.\nThey dashed into the feast, throwing down platters of food, cutting down\nmen and women and children with impunity, razors flicking the air like a\nmaster’s brush painting a bloody masterpiece.\n“To arms!” Tamas bellowed. His first shot took a Barber between the\neyes at a hundred paces. He didn’t need his sorcery for that. “Can you\nreload this?” Tamas said, dropping the pistol into Prime’s hands. “Bullets!”\nOne of his guards paused in aiming to give him a handful of round balls and\nanother of powder charges. Tamas flicked one bullet in the air and ignited a\npowder charge with a thought. Another Barber dropped, then another.\n“Why the pit do you even need this?” Prime said, handing him the\nloaded pistol.\n“Better accuracy,” Tamas said, surprised that an academic could reload\na pistol so quickly. The crowd began to writhe and move, people moving\nlike a panicked herd of cattle at the sound of pistol shots. Tamas steeled\nhimself as he noted some of the crowd looking toward the open doors of the\nHouse of Nobles.\n“Get those doors closed,” he told a guardsman. He raised his pistol.\n“Make sure Lady Winceslav is inside.”\n“There!” Prime said. The old man nudged Tamas’s pistol toward\nMihali. Tamas saw the Barber come out of the crowd near the chef. Tamas\npulled the trigger. The man dropped like a stone.\n“Novi’s frosted toes!” Tamas said. “Sabon was supposed to take care of\nthe Barbers. Mihali! Get out of there!”\nThe chef did not hear him. He still stood on a table, waving his arms\nand shouting, seemingly unaware of the dead Barber nearby.\n“Another,” Prime said, pointing. “They’re going for Mihali.”\n“Why?” Tamas said. He handed the pistol back to Prime and flicked a\nbullet in the air. The shot glanced off a Barber’s shoulder and into the\ncrowd, where a man clutched at his side. Tamas grimaced. “We’re too far. I"

I\ncan’t help him much without more weaponry.” He dug into his pockets for\nmore bullets. He was out. “Shit. God or madman, he may be on his own\nnow. Get me more rounds!”\n“No.” Prime slowly shook his head. “We can’t leave him alone.”\n“We damn well have to. We won’t get through that rabble.” The crowd\nwas now on the move. They fled sluggishly, seemingly swayed by Mihali’s\nentreating them to remain calm, but his shouts could not fully quell the\nboiling fear of a mob.\n“We have to try,” Prime said. “Come on, bring your guards.” He\ngrabbed Tamas’s arm.\nLady Winceslav appeared on his other side. Tamas stifled a curse.\n“Lady, you need to get inside!”\n“I won’t leave my soldiers out here alone,” Lady Winceslav said. She\nclenched her fists. “Get me a rifle. We’ll fight our way to the chef and—”\nPrime’s gasp startled Tamas. “It’s him. Open your third eye!”\n“How do you…” Tamas didn’t have to open his third eye. He felt the\nsorcery wash over him with the strength of the coming tide.\n“Adom,” Prime said. “He’s dropped his disguise.”\n“What is he doing?” Tamas felt numb, helpless. He’d never experienced\nsorcery like this before. If feeling a Privileged do magic was like the heat of\na candle, this was as if he stood in a smith’s furnace.\n“He’s channeling a spell!”\n“I don’t understand.”\n“Channeling! The few moments it takes a sorcerer to create sorcery, to\npluck at the auras of the Else. He’s not tearing down a building or\ndestroying a battalion. He’s been channeling all week! This food, these\npeople. They are all part of it. He is weaving auras into the very city. If the\nBarbers reach him, it’ll destroy everything he’s worked for!”\n“How do you know all this?”\n“We haven’t time!” Prime let go of Tamas’s arm as the edge of the\ncrowd moved toward them. One of Tamas’s guards was tossed to the\nground, nearly trampled underfoot before he was pulled out of harm’s way.\nThe crowd began to writhe like an animal. They’d all be swept away,\nguards or not. This was not something soldiers could tame.\n“We need to get inside, sir.” Olem was at Tamas’s side, rifle in hand.\nHe’d been out among the tables when the whole thing started.\nTamas glanced between Olem and Prime. They needed to retreat, let the\npanic die down. He would take care of the Barbers later. They were\nfinished. He took a step back, gripping his crutch. What the pit was Prime\nblathering on about? Channeling spells? Tamas would have sensed it. “Bar\nthe doors to the House. I don’t want this rabble getting in.”\n“Sir?”\n“We’re going after Mihali.”\n“That’s suicide, sir.”\n“Troop, form up!”"

Soldiers joined them from the House\nof Nobles. He had thirty men within a few moments. Thirty men would do\nnothing against the mad rush of a hundred thousand.\n“Lady, you should go inside,” Tamas said for the final time.\nSomeone had given Lady Winceslav a rifle. She looked like she knew\nhow to handle it. Her eyes held no fear. Tamas respected that.\n“No bayonets, men,” Tamas ordered. “Shove with the stock. Where’s\nPrime?”\n“There,” Olem said.\nTamas looked over. Prime stood several feet outside his men, the\npacked rush of the mob only fingers from the front of his coat. “Someone\nget him!” Tamas snapped. “Old bastard will get himself killed.”\nA soldier broke off and ran for the vice-chancellor. He grabbed Prime’s\ncoat. The old man shrugged him off with surprising force. Beyond him, far\ninto the crowd, Mihali still stood on his table. He’d ceased to yell and now\nstood gazing down into the mob, a frown on his face. Despite the violence\nof the rush, no one came within ten paces of his table.\nUntil a Barber broke through.\n“My pistol,” Tamas said. “Quickly!”\nAnother Barber stumbled from the crowd and into Mihali’s circle of\ncalm. He shook his head, as if confused, and then exchanged looks with the\nother. A third joined them, and they began to advance on Mihali.\n“Weapon!” Tamas yelled.\nThe soldier had no luck in dragging Prime toward the building. Tamas\ncaught sight of the old vice-chancellor out of the corner of his eye. Prime’s\nshoulders slumped. Then he reached slowly into his pockets and removed a\npair of white gloves with red and gold runes. He pulled them on and raised\nhis hands.\nTamas looked on, astonished. The vice-chancellor, the spectacled old\noverweight professor of histories, was a Privileged? How had Tamas never\nknown? Prime worked his fingers in the air like an orchestra conductor. An\naudible wump split the air and the crowd was divided in two. A pathway as\nwide as a carriage opened up. An invisible force pressed people away.\nSome clawed and thrashed as if at a glass wall, while others were crushed\nup against it like boats upon the rocks.\n“Get your soldiers in there,” Prime said over his shoulder.\nTamas hesitated. “Go,” he said after a moment. He hobbled toward the\nvice-chancellor, grabbing his rifle from a soldier and aiming at a Barber. He\nonly had one shot and no spare powder charges. It was too far to make the\nbullet bounce, and his men wouldn’t get there in time. The analysis lasted\njust a fraction of a second. He aimed at the biggest, most dangerous-looking\nof the Barbers and pulled the trigger.\nThe Barber evaporated. The bullet went through a fine red cloud of mist\nand hit a woman in the shoulder. Tamas felt his eyes widen. He pointed the\npistol straight in the air and looked at the barrel. Nothing seemed out of the\nordinary. He looked back toward Mihali."

He looked back toward Mihali.\nThe second Barber paused, eyes on the cloud that had once been his\ncomrade, his mouth slightly open. The red mist disappeared like the smoke\nfrom a pipe in a stiff breeze. The third Barber charged toward Mihali, razor\nin the air. Tamas thought he heard a slight pop, and this one disappeared as\nwell. No clothes, no metal blade remained. Nothing but the red mist, which\nwas gone with the breeze. The second Barber turned to flee, and with a\nsubtle pop—not imagined—he was gone. Tamas shook his head as more\npops filled his ears. Someone screamed.\nThe square began to empty. Mihali was left alone, standing upon his\ntable, arms folded. He looked sternly out across the paving stones as the last\nof the fleeing crowd took off down the avenues. Food was strewn about the\nground; tables and chairs overturned; plates, bowls, and cups abandoned.\nThere a pot had been overturned, porridge slowly spreading along the\nground, and here the bodies of bystanders lay unmoving. A woman groaned\nin pain.\n“Help her,” Tamas told a soldier, pointing.\nBehind him, the doors of the House of Nobles swung open. Soldiers\npoured out.\n“What happened, sir?” Vlora asked, rushing to his side.\n“The Black Street Barbers,” Tamas spat. “Adamat and Sabon didn’t do\ntheir job.”\n“Where the pit are they?”\n“I shot a couple. They’re…” Tamas stopped. The wounded Barbers\nwere gone. He blinked. Was that a red mist where they’d been? “I saw\nmore. They must have fled with the crowd.” He brushed past Olem and\nhobbled down the stairs. He paused next to the vice-chancellor. Prime stood\nwith his hands in his jacket pockets, surveying the empty square with a firm\nlook of consternation.\n“Who the pit are you?” Tamas said. His hands trembled. The sorcery\nthat had washed over him minutes before was gone, hidden again. It had\nclearly come from Mihali, but then what of the vice-chancellor? A\nPrivileged this whole time? Tamas would have seen it.\nPrime removed his hand from his pocket and drummed his fingers on\nhis belly. He’d taken off his Privileged gloves.\n“You’re one of them,” Tamas said when it became clear Prime would\nnot answer his question. “One of the Predeii. Like Julene.” It was true. All\nof it was true. Tamas felt dread settle in his stomach. “Don’t go anywhere.”\nTamas headed out toward Mihali.\nThe big chef had climbed down from his table and was righting chairs.\nHe paused next to a spilled cauldron of porridge, placing his hand gently on\nthe rim. He frowned.\nTamas paused a dozen paces from Mihali. The porridge faded before his\neyes, like rain drying on sun-warmed bricks. Mihali bent over the cauldron\nand gripped the sides with both arms. He lifted it easily, though it must\nhave weighed twenty stone, and returned it to an iron tripod."

He lifted it easily, though it must\nhave weighed twenty stone, and returned it to an iron tripod.\nTamas opened his third eye and fought off the dizziness. The world\nglowed. The paving stones where the porridge had been were smudged pink\nto Tamas’s inner sight. The colors swirled around Mihali like some kind of\nfestival streamers, though they never once touched the chef himself.\nMihali dropped into a chair and rested his elbow on his knee with his\nchin in the palm of his hand. He caught sight of Tamas.\n“Thank you for looking out for me,” Mihali said.\n“I was too far to do much good,” Tamas said.\nMihali gave him a weak smile. “Still. I am vulnerable in this body.”\n“They’ve ruined your feast,” Tamas said.\n“The people will be back.” Mihali brushed a hand across his brow. One\nof his assistants approached him, put a hand on his back gently. He pulled\nher close with one big arm and kissed her on the forehead. “And there will\nbe more,” he said with a sigh. “My own work was not ruined. Delayed a\nlittle, but not ruined.”\n“Prime says you were channeling a spell,” Tamas said.\nMihali looked past Tamas’s shoulder toward the vice-chancellor. “Very\nperceptive.” He gripped his assistant’s arm for a moment and shooed her\naway. “I remember you now,” he said as Prime approached. “It’s been a\nvery long time.”\n“Fourteen centuries or so,” Prime said. “So it really is you? I didn’t\nbelieve it… I didn’t want to believe it.” He took a shaky breath. “I believed\nit had been long enough that Kresimir would never return. I believed it was\ntime for change. I thought all of Rozalia’s concerns were foolish, and that\nJulene was living in the past. I believed we were alone.”\n“My people have never been alone,” Mihali said. “The others may have\nleft. I did not.”\n“What did you do to those Barbers?” Tamas asked.\nMihali didn’t look happy. “They no longer exist,” he said. His voice\nwas glum, in the manner of a man who’d done something he didn’t want to.\n“I lost my temper,” he said. “I don’t like…” He paused, his voice cracked.\n“They felt no pain. I don’t like to harm people.”\nTamas watched the chef for a few moments, a thousand questions\nflooding his mind. Something stilled his tongue.\n“Sir,” Olem said, coming to his side. “We can’t find any of the Barbers.\nNot one.”\nTamas said, “You won’t.” He took a deep breath. “He’s a god, Olem. A\nreal, live god in the flesh.” The newfound conviction was not a happy one.\nHis head ached. His stomach reeled. “This is not good.”\nOlem was staring at Mihali as if trying to make up his own mind. “Why\nnot? I mean, if he’s a god, isn’t that good?”\nTamas looked up at the sky.

It was a beautiful day, warm without being\nhot, breezy without a strong wind, the sun pleasant on the face. “Because,”\nTamas said, “Mihali is not the only god. There’s Kresimir. And this means\nKresimir can be summoned back. It means Kresimir will come for me. It\nmeans Bo’s warnings were not rubbish. And that’s not good.” He felt a\npresence at his side, a big hand on his shoulder. Mihali had joined him.\n“It’s worse than that,” Mihali said. “If it was just you, I’d be sorry,\nbut…”\nTamas felt ill. His leg had begun to throb again. He shifted and felt a\nstab of pain. He choked back vomit. “What do you mean?”\n“He’ll destroy the whole country,” Mihali said. “Every man, woman,\nand child. Every plant and animal. He’ll raze it to the ground.”\n“Why?”\n“My brother is not a… kind god,” Mihali said. “He’ll find it easier to\nstart over.”\nTamas clenched his fists. Gods. How could he deal with that? What\ncould he do? “Why hasn’t he done it yet?”\nMihali regarded South Pike Mountain. “He has been on a long journey,\nmy brother. I don’t think he actually ever intended to return. But he will be\nsummoned. There are those who seek to accomplish that, those who seek to\nprevent its happening.” Mihali turned to Tamas. “It’s too late for you to\ninfluence that battle. I will try to protect Adro from his power, but you need\nto clean your house.”\n“The traitor,” Tamas whispered.\n“If there are more interruptions like this”—he gestured around them —\n“if there are more distractions…”\n“But I don’t know who it is,” Tamas said.\n“He might,” Olem said, pointing across the square. Tamas turned to see\nSabon and Adamat rushing toward them.\nChapter 37\nElections Square was in shambles. Soldiers wandered about the clutter of\nfallen chairs and spilled food and overturned tables as if after a battle,\ndolefully picking among the debris. A few townsfolk were being taken\naway on stretchers as Adamat arrived, and a knot of men had gathered\nbeneath the steps of the House of Nobles.\nAdamat watched Sabon reach the knot ahead of him. He slowed to a\nwalk, casting about for signs of what had happened. Were they too late?\nPeople had fled in chaos, that much was clear. But what had happened?\nAdamat didn’t see any of the Barbers or any fallen soldiers. Those on the\nground weren’t in uniforms of any kind, only townsfolk caught by some\nkind of crossfire. He saw slashed throats, blood spilled on the cobbles, even\na few gunshot wounds. Families gathered around their fallen members.\nWomen wailed.\nAdamat reached the knot of soldiers and let out a sigh of relief.

Lady Winceslav stood nearby, and both Ricard Tumblar and Ondraus\nthe Reeve approached from across the square as Tamas’s troops fanned out\nto help the wounded.\nSabon shook his head to something Tamas asked him. They both turned\nexpectantly to Adamat.\nTamas opened his mouth to speak.\n“Charlemund,” Adamat said. “The arch-diocel.”\nRage danced across Tamas’s face. He warred with his emotions a\nmoment before gaining his composure. Through clenched teeth he said,\n“How do you know?”\nAdamat explained quickly about Siemone the priest and Teef’s\nconfession. “It has to be Charlemund,” Adamat said. “The priest Teef\ndescribed matched Siemone too well to be coincidence.”\n“This priest,” Tamas said. “It’s not possible he’s working for someone\nelse?”\n“No.” Yes, of course it was possible. There was never absolute certainty.\nBut it was very unlikely, and Adamat had to be firm in his decision.\nTamas’s bodyguard drew near. “Let’s tear him down,” Olem said. “We\nhave the name. We have a witness. We can’t hesitate.”\n“Agreed,” Sabon said.\nTamas closed his eyes.\n“It must be done,” Sabon said.\nAdamat watched the field marshal. Tamas was scared, he realized.\nCharlemund was the only member of his council with the power to crush\nhim outright. Tamas could leave him be, and wait for the next assassin, or\nhe could attack and risk the wrath of the Church. Adamat did not envy\nTamas that decision.\nTamas slowly studied the faces of those around him. His gaze came to\nrest on the chef. Mihali gave Tamas a brief nod. There was something here\nthat Adamat had missed. “Why did he come after you?” Tamas asked the\nchef.\nMihali stared at nothing for a moment, a scowl on his face. “That is\ncloudy,” he said. “Julene is a Predeii. She knows I inhabit a mortal body.\nPerhaps she warned him. Or perhaps others have entered the fray.”\nTamas waited for Ricard Tumblar and Ondraus. When they’d arrived,\nhe said, “Charlemund has betrayed our cause. I will not suffer that. I do not\nknow if his treachery has the blessing of the Church. I do not care. Who\nstands with me?”\n“I,” Ricard said, stepping forward.\n“I do,” Lady Winceslav said.\nPrime Lektor nodded.\n“Of course,” Ondraus said with a snort.\nTamas said, “Prepare the horses and carriages. Get me whatever troops\nwe have on hand. I’m going to arrest the arch-diocel.”\n“Go to him?” Sabon asked. “Why can’t we just call a meeting? When\nhe comes, we will take him.”\n“We have to force him to play his hand,” Tamas said. “His spies will\ntell him the attack on Mihali failed and that he has been exposed. If he flees,"

If he flees,\nwe confirm his guilt. If he stays, we will confront him. Either way, I will\nnot let him escape. Get moving.”\nAdamat felt himself swept aside as the soldiers rushed into action.\nTamas paused beside him, leaning heavily on his cane, and placed a hand\non his shoulder. “Good work,” he said. “Go home. Pack up.” His voice\ndropped. “Get your family out of the country. If everything goes well, I will\nhave use for you and your skills in the future.”\nDid he joke? Adamat searched Tamas’s face. No. He was serious. Too\nserious. Tamas moved away, jerking like a marionette as he walked, his\ncrutch clicking against the paving stones.\nSigns of cave lions only increased as Taniel’s company approached the\nsummit. The dogs pulled at their harnesses despite Rina’s rebukes. Half the\ntime they wanted to give chase. Half the time they whimpered, tugging\nRina back down the slope.\nTaniel felt his own nerves begin to fray. In his mind the cave lions were\nbeyond each slight rise, or waiting to pounce from every boulder. The wild\neyes of his companions said they were thinking the same thing. Yet they\nweren’t being tracked. All signs said the creatures were ahead of them,\nfollowing the Kez in force. By their tracks there were at least seventy of the\ncreatures, and growing more numerous by the mile.\nThey found the first body partially devoured and dragged to the side of\nthe trail. It was torn and mangled, blood soaking the white snow, but easy\nenough to tell it had been a cave lion. Ka poel squatted beside it, her fingers\n‑\nsearching through the snow. Taniel thought he saw her put something in her\npack. He came up beside her.\n“What killed it?” he asked. He already had a pretty good idea.\nKa poel mimed firing a rifle.\n‑\nHe nodded. “So the Kez know they’re being followed. And these\ncreatures. They feast on their own kind. How far from the top?” he asked\nwhen saw Bo had joined them.\n“Not far, I think,” Bo said. “I’ve only come this high once before.” He\nturned to the monk. “Del?”\nTheir guide had paled at the sight of the cave lion carcass. Slowly, his\nhands shaking, he lifted one arm to point ahead. “There,” he managed.\nTaniel followed his gaze toward an outcropping where the trail\ndisappeared. “That close?” Taniel frowned. “Where’s the city?”\n“There,” Del said again.\n“You’ll see what he means,” Bo said.\nIt took less than half an hour to reach the height Del had indicated. They\nclimbed a steep knoll in the road. Taniel paused to catch his breath, only to\nfind it whisked from him at the sight below.\nHe stood on the lip of a vast crater. It had to be tens of miles across and\nit was hundreds of feet deep. Taniel wobbled, then regained his footing.\nThere were trees below, species that could never have survived at this"

    "text": "it was hundreds of feet deep. Taniel wobbled, then regained his footing.\nThere were trees below, species that could never have survived at this\naltitude. They ringed the inner edge of the crater, towering in the air. He\ncould almost reach out and touch the tops of the closest ones. Yet these\ntrees were long dead. Their sides were scorched black, their branches naked\nand twisted. Once, they were a mighty grove. Now they looked like the\nboneyard of someplace long cursed.\nPast the trees were the ruins of a vast city. Buildings filled the greater\npart of the crater—more buildings than there were in all of Adopest, and\nmany taller too. They were little more than stone husks now. Their sides\nwere blackened like the trees, shutterless windows staring out like the\nempty sockets of thousand-eyed skulls. The sight made Taniel shiver.\n“The Kresim Caldera,” Del said. His voice quaked.\nBo’s face was grim. “Kresimir’s protection has faded over the centuries.\nThe volcano’s acid and heat have killed the trees and burned out the\nbuildings. Nothing lives up here.”\n“Except the cave lions,” Taniel said. “I don’t know how they can.”\n“Something keeps them alive,” Bo said.\nTaniel could see a lake in the middle of the caldera. There were plots of\ntrees as well, and ponds, and clear knolls that had once been parks where\nchildren played in the Time of Kresimir. Taniel imagined that the waters\nwithin the caldera had once run clean and beautiful. From his vantage point\nhe could see that the lake was foul and brown. It bubbled and belched, and a\nthick cloud of steam and smoke rose from its center.\nIn the distance Taniel heard the scream of a cave lion.\n“Fix bayonets,” he said. He heard the clatter of weapons as the\nWatchers behind him readied themselves.\nSpreading out, they proceeded into the crater.\nTaniel positioned himself between Del and Bo. “Where is the\ncoliseum?” he asked.\nDel didn’t respond. Taniel thought he heard a whimper come from the\nman. Then again, it could have been the dogs. They’d fallen deathly silent\nsince entering the caldera.\n“South Pike had a proper peak when Kresimir was summoned,” Bo\nsaid. His brow furrowed. “It’s said that when he touched the ground, the\nvery earth dropped out from beneath him and the mountain erupted,\nspewing soot and acid into the air, enough to coat all of Adro. The Predeii\nbarely survived. When all had settled, the caldera had formed and Kresimir\nstood on the shore of Pike Lake.” He pointed toward the center of the\ncaldera.\n“That’s where the coliseum is?”\nDel nodded.\n“I’ll need someplace to line up a shot into the coliseum. The farther\naway, the better, but it needs a clear view.”\nDel seemed to consider this for a few moments. “Kresimir’s palace.\nFollow me. I can get us there.”\nThey fell silent as they passed through the deepest part of the dead\nforest.

    "text": "They fell silent as they passed through the deepest part of the dead\nforest. Their footsteps echoed on the hard-packed cobblestone road, and\nTaniel realized suddenly that there was no snow. The ground was bare, with\neven the hardiest forest scrubs and bushes long dead. The air, he also noted,\nwas growing warmer. Some remnant from Kresimir’s protection of the\nHoly City? Or heat from the heart of the volcano? Would they even be able\nto approach Pike Lake? Unbearable heat and poisonous gases might drive\nthem away. They didn’t have the sorcerous protection of Julene and the Kez\nCabal. Taniel gave Bo a glance. He was looking less and less well. Taniel\ndoubted he could protect a fly, let alone the rest of them.\nThey found the next bodies at the edge of the forest on the near side of a\nsmall hill. These, Taniel noted as he got closer, were not just cave lions.\nA Warden lay torn to shreds among the remains of at least six or seven\ncave lions. His hand, the flesh stripped from the bones, still remained\naround the throat of a dead cave lion. Taniel held a handkerchief over his\nnose against the smell. The bodies hadn’t been around long enough to begin\nto rot, but the lions were putrid, and their stink was far more pronounced\nhere where the cold had begun to fade and the wind did not carry it away.\nKa poel went on ahead again. She paused just on the other side of the\n‑\nhill, still in sight, and waved her arms at them. Taniel was glad to leave the\nbodies behind.\nNot for long. He came to a stop beside Ka poel and choked down bile.\n‑\nHe heard someone spilling their breakfast noisily behind him. A quick\nglance told him it was Bo.\nThere’d been a pitched battle here. Wardens had made their stand in the\ncenter of a small park—presumably while Julene and the Kez Privileged\nescaped into the heart of the city. A dozen of them had died, and three times\ntheir number in cave lions. Their remains lay scattered across the onetime\npark. Nearby, a Warden lay with one arm up on a stone bench, his entrails\nspread about the ground before him. He’d been feasted upon in great haste.\n“These things are hungry,” Rina said. Her dogs crouched at her feet,\nunwilling to leave their master’s side. “They run as if they are hunting, as if\nthey have a purpose to attack and kill, yet whenever there is a death, they\nstop for the meat. They’re starving.”\nTaniel swallowed. “They’re hungry? Is that why they’re chasing the\nKez?” It was much easier to handle, though no less dangerous, than the\nthought of the lions being guided by some supernatural force or\nintelligence.\nRina shrugged. “It’s possible. But cave lions don’t hunt in packs, even\nin the worst of times. They are solitary creatures.”\n“How could there be so many on the mountain?” Bo said. “There’s\nnothing to eat up here. I’ve never heard of more than one or two cave lions\non an entire mountainside.”\nNo one seemed to have an answer.\nTaniel checked each of his pistols and his rifle to make sure they were"

His hands shook. His body told him\nto take more powder. He’d need it. He fought the impulse. He’d be powder\nblind with much more. Then again, he’d be dead without the strength. He\ntook another snort.\nThe trail of carnage led through the park and onto a boulevard that\nseemed to head into the center of the city. Blood and bits of Warden and\ncave lion had been dragged along as the cave lions chased the Kez\nPrivileged.\nAs they entered the city, Taniel kept his eyes on the buildings. Not a\nsound issued from within any of them, though the wind should have\nhowled, or tiny animals should have moved about. Nothing. The city was\ncompletely dead, even the elements, and it chilled Taniel’s soul.\nA hand on his shoulder made Taniel spin, rifle in hand, and almost gut\nDel with his bayonet. Taniel stilled his beating heart. “Sorry,” he said.\n“The palace,” Del said, “is that way.” He pointed into the heart of the\ncity.\nThey altered course according to Del’s instructions. Though the city\nspooked the pit out of him, Taniel was grateful to be away from the trail of\nthe cave lions and Privileged. He’d find Kresimir’s palace and pick away at\nthe Privilegeds’ numbers from a safe distance, and they wouldn’t have\nenough power to summon Kresimir.\nAdamat heard rumors all the way home about the massacre in Elections\nSquare. Most traffic headed away from the square. Word was spreading fast\nand there were signs of the Rope everywhere he went as people warded\nagainst bad luck and ill omens. A massacre during the Festival of St. Adom\nwas bad enough to keep many people home.\nHe hoped he’d be able to hire a carriage immediately for Offendale.\nHe’d get his family and get out of the country and then…\n“SouSmith!” Adamat called as he hung his coat on the rack. He\nstopped. There were three coats too many hanging there. He closed his\neyes. Not again.\n“Can’t you let me be…?” Adamat walked into the sitting room and\nfroze.\nLord Vetas and his two goons stood on the far side of the room. Astrit\nstood between them, Lord Vetas’s thin hands on her shoulders. She looked\nlike a helpless fly caught in a spider’s web. The sight of his little girl nearly\nstopped Adamat’s heart. It was one thing to know she was in danger. It was\nanother to see her here in Lord Vetas’s grip.\nSouSmith sat on the sofa. He had returned here immediately after their\nvisit to the Barbers. His face was pale, and sweat ran down his cheeks. His\nbreath labored unsteadily, a hand clutched over his wound.\n“Sorry,” SouSmith said weakly. “Here before me.”\n“SouSmith told me of your visit to the Barbers,” Lord Vetas said. There\nwas no emotion in his voice, no hint of compassion or pity. “To survive\nthree assassins. Bravo.”\n“Let her go,” Adamat said tiredly. The weight of the last two days"

The weight of the last two days\nsuddenly pressed upon him horribly. He wanted nothing more than to drop\ninto his favorite chair and nap the rest of the day. It looked like that wasn’t\nan option anymore.\n“Catch me up,” Lord Vetas said. “How is Teef?”\n“Rotting in Sabletooth,” Adamat snapped. “How is Lord Claremonte?”\nThe look of surprise on Lord Vetas’s face vanished so quickly it might\nnot have been there at all.\nAdamat said quietly, “Astrit, are you all right?”\nThe little girl nodded. Her face was smudged with dirt, her sundress\nrumpled from having been slept in, but she looked unharmed. “I’m OK,\nPapa,” she said.\n“Are you scared?”\nShe clenched her teeth and shook her head.\n“That’s my girl. Did they hurt you?”\nAnother head shake.\n“Why is Teef in Sabletooth?” Lord Vetas said.\n“Because he’d had a deal with Tamas. He broke it trying to kill me.”\nLord Vetas frowned. “Why didn’t you tell me he’d had a deal with\nTamas?”\n“I didn’t know.”\n“Really?” Lord Vetas squeezed Astrit’s shoulders. She tried to wiggle\naway, but he had her firmly.\n“Yes, damn you. I didn’t know, I swear.”\nLord Vetas loosened his grip. “I trust you discovered the traitor? Tamas\nis on his way to arrest Ricard Tumblar?”\nLord Vetas had little reason to think the traitor was Ricard unless he’d\nbeen helping frame him all along. “What interest does Lord Claremonte\nhave in all this?” Adamat said. “Why care at all about the politics here?\nHe’s not even Adran.”\n“Lord Claremonte’s interests are those of the Brudania-Gurla Trading\nCompany,” Lord Vetas said. “And they rest upon the fortunes of the Nine.”\n“Where does he stand?”\n“Neutral,” Lord Vetas said. “A nudge here. A push there. That is all you\nneed know. Now, when will Tamas arrest Ricard Tumblar?”\n“Never.”\n“Why not?”\n“He’s on his way to arrest Charlemund, the real traitor.”\nAstrit cried out as Lord Vetas twisted her shoulders viciously. “All the\nevidence points to Ricard,” Vetas said. “Why do you think it’s\nCharlemund?”\n“He was named in front of Tamas’s powder mage. What could I have\ndone?” Adamat stepped forward.\n“Back!” Lord Vetas snapped. His goons came alert and shot menacing\nlooks toward Adamat.\n“Harm her and you’re a dead man.”\n“Along with the rest of your family,” Lord Vetas said.\n“Vetas,” Adamat said. “I swear on all the Nine that I will destroy you\nand your house if you harm my daughter. I will bring down Lord\nClaremonte as if he were a dog for me to kick in the street.” He felt\nsomething cold quiver in his bowels."

I will bring down Lord\nClaremonte as if he were a dog for me to kick in the street.” He felt\nsomething cold quiver in his bowels.\nLord Vetas inhaled sharply. His grip on Astrit’s shoulders loosened, and\nthe girl pulled away. Adamat caught her with one hand, pushing her behind\nhim.\nThe coal-shoveler goon produced a knife, the other goon a pistol. Lord\nVetas stayed them with a warning hand. “This can still be salvaged. You’re\ntoo good to lose, Adamat. We won’t kill you… yet. When will the arrest\ntake place?”\n“As soon as Tamas gathers his men.” Did Vetas mean to warn\nCharlemund?\n“Where?”\n“His villa,” Adamat said.\n“You’d better be telling the truth,” Lord Vetas said. “Kale,” he said.\nThe coal shoveler turned his head.\n“Go to the villa. Warn the arch-diocel. Tell him you were sent by the\nMadman. If the good duke is still there, they should be able to construct an\neasy trap for Tamas.”\nThe coal shoveler nodded his head once. He gave Adamat a warning\nlook and then pushed past him and was out the front door at a run.\n“Why is Claremonte working with the arch-diocel?” Adamat asked.\n“And if he is, why did Charlemund try to kill me? I’m supposed to be\nworking for Claremonte as well.”\nVetas regarded him coldly. “One hand does not know what the other is\ndoing—such a strategy has its price, which you almost paid. Charlemund’s\ntask was simply to kill the imposter god, Mihali. He became too zealous.\nAnd know this: Charlemund is nothing more than a hand. Claremonte uses\npeople like him to his own ends.”\n“No one uses an arch-diocel.”\n“Claremonte does.”\n“To what purpose?”\n“Beyond your comprehension,” Lord Vetas said. “You’ve disappointed\nme, Adamat. The girl was going to be a show of good faith, a gift to you for\ndoing what you’re bidden. Now, though, I think she’ll come back with me.\nI’ve got men who enjoy that sort of thing.” He stepped forward, gesturing to\nhis man with the pistol.\nAdamat squeezed his hands into fists. “All right!” he said.\nLord Vetas paused.\n“They’re not going to arrest him at his villa. He’s at the cathedral,\nleading an afternoon prayer service. Please, just leave my daughter here.”\nLord Vetas’s eyes flashed. “You lied to me?”\n“That’s the truth of it, I swear it!”\n“Pit! You”—he gestured at the other goon—“stay here. If they try to\nleave, kill Adamat, and then the boxer and the girl.”\nLord Vetas swept out of the room, shouldering Adamat hard as he\npassed. Adamat grunted. Lord Vetas reached the street and broke into a run,\ncoattails flailing behind him. Adamat watched him disappear from view\nthrough the window. He let out a long breath.\n“Are you OK, Papa?” Astrit said."

He didn’t even cry out.”\n“He’s a very brave boy.”\n“What happens now, Papa?”\n“I don’t know,” he said.\nAdamat couldn’t be there when Vetas returned. It would mean death for\nthem all. SouSmith looked like he could barely walk, and Astrit was just a\ngirl, but Adamat had to warn Tamas.\n“Stay here,” he whispered to Astrit.\n“Hey!” the other goon said as Adamat headed toward the other side of\nthe room.\nAdamat stopped, raising his hands. The goon waved his pistol between\nSouSmith and Adamat. SouSmith’s eyes were closed, his hands held over\nhis wounds. He was breathing shallowly. Judging SouSmith to be less of a\nthreat, the goon pointed his pistol at Adamat.\n“I just want a drink,” Adamat said.\nThe goon narrowed his eyes.\n“Please,” Adamat said. He held out his hands to show they were\nshaking.\n“Right,” the goon said. “I’ll just be watching to make sure you ain’t got\na weapon stashed here.”\n“What?” Adamat said. “A loaded pistol in the liquor cabinet? You’re\nmad. If you think I’m going to pull a knife, stand over there.” He gestured\nto the sofa.\nThe goon shuffled away from Adamat until he was near the sofa. “I’m\nwatching you.”\nGood. Adamat removed a bottle from the cabinet. “Wine?”\nThe goon shook his head.\nAdamat pulled the cork with a corkscrew and took a moment to unwind\nthe cork, tossing it down on a shelf. He poured two glasses, the neck of the\nbottle clinking against the rim of the cup as his hands shook. He stepped\ntoward the goon. “You sure you don’t want some?”\n“I’ll let you drink first,” the goon said. “I know the tricks.”\n“No tricks,” Adamat said, shaking his head. “You think I’d poison a\ntwo-hundred-krana bottle of wine? Besides, poison doesn’t work fast\nenough. You’d still have time to shoot me while you died. SouSmith?\nWine?”\nThe boxer nodded weakly.\n“Pardon,” Adamat said, lifting the two glasses to show he meant no\nharm as he stepped by the goon.\nHe dropped both glasses at the same time. One hand diverted the pistol,\nthe other jabbed the goon’s neck with the corkscrew. The pistol went off,\ndeafening Adamat. A window shattered, and Astrit screamed.

Adamat remained on top of the goon\nuntil long after he’d stopped struggling. He grabbed the lapels of his jacket\nand lifted the goon off SouSmith and dropped him on the floor. SouSmith\nmoaned, writhing on the sofa.\n“Coulda given me warning,” he said, feeling his wound. “I’m bleeding\nagain.”\n“You big baby,” Adamat said. He made sure the goon was dead, and\nlooked up. Astrit was watching from the hallway. He said, “Go to your\nroom.”\nAstrit stood there, shaking.\nAdamat climbed to his feet and stripped his bloody jacket off, tossing it\non the floor. He lifted Astrit into his arms. “I’m sorry you had to see that,”\nhe said. “Are you all right?”\n“Yes, Papa.” Her voice quavered.\n“Good girl. I need you to be strong, love. I need you to go with\nSouSmith. You have to hide with him.”\nSouSmith pulled himself off the sofa slowly, grimacing with pain. “No\nwet nurse,” he said. “Where you going?”\n“I have to go warn Tamas.”\n“Like shit,” SouSmith grunted. “I’ll go…” He stumbled, catching\nhimself on the sofa arm.\n“Take Astrit,” Tamas said. He led the little girl over to SouSmith and put\nher hand in his. “Hide. Protect her. Please.” He took a deep breath. “You’ll\nknow soon enough if I fail. Just… keep her away from Lord Vetas.”\nSouSmith considered Adamat a moment, then gave a brief nod.\n“Thank you, my friend.”\n“You don’t pay me enough,” SouSmith grunted.\n“Tales will be told of your sacrifice,” Adamat said. He went to his\noffice and opened a long, nondescript chest in the corner. He removed his\nsmallsword from its sheath and checked the blade and hilt. The sword was\nnothing special—it had been issued to him in the army, before he’d become\nan inspector. It was undecorated, with an oval shell of a guard over the hilt.\nIt was in good condition. He heard footsteps behind him.\n“I haven’t touched this for a decade,” he said. “It looks to be in good\nshape.”\n“Better hope,” SouSmith said.\nAdamat turned around.\nSouSmith held out a pistol, along with extra shot and charges. “Luck to\nyou.”\nThey clasped hands, and Adamat was out the door.\nChapter 38\n“How are you going to explain this to the Church?” Olem asked.\n“Easy,” Tamas said with a conviction he didn’t feel. “The Church\ndoesn’t like to be played any more than we do.

Olem wanted to be certain he\nwasn’t charging blindly to his death.\n“Torture an arch-diocel?” Olem asked. He finished cleaning and loading\nTamas’s long-barreled pistol. Tamas was grateful he didn’t smoke around\ngunpowder. Olem handed the weapon to Tamas and started on his own.\n“You really think he’ll tell us what we need to know?”\n“Yes,” Tamas said, hoping that there was enough confidence in his\nvoice. Arresting the arch-diocel was insanely risky. If Adamat didn’t really\nhave enough evidence; if the Church decided to ignore the evidence; pit, if\nthe Church didn’t care, Tamas’s world would come crashing down around\nhim. No one, not even Kez’s immense armies of spies and assassins, could\ndestroy someone’s life as thoroughly as the Church.\nThe carriage came to a jolting stop. Tamas glanced out the window. A\ndragoon rode by, then another. Sabon came to the carriage window.\n“We’ve taken the gatehouse. No sign of movement inside the villa.”\n“Very good,” Tamas said. He lifted his pistol and saluted Sabon with\nthe barrel. “Let’s go in.”\nThe carriage rocked forward and through the villa’s front gate. A pair of\nguards in purple-and-gold Church doublets stood between two of Tamas’s\nsoldiers, hands on their heads, glaring at the carriages as they went by.\n“I hope you’ll have the good sense to let us go in first, sir,” Olem said.\n“And miss the look on Charlemund’s face when you tell him the\ncharges? Bloody pit, no. I’ll hobble my ass up those front steps with the rest\nof you.”\n“He may put up a fight,” Olem said.\nTamas fingered his pistol. “I hope so.”\n“You’re willing to risk his bodyguard having a few air rifles?” Olem\nsaid. “It only takes one.”\n“You ruin my fun, Olem. You really do.”\nThe carriage stopped again after a few minutes. Sabon opened the\ncarriage door. “The house and yards are surrounded. Our men checked the\nchapel and most of the outlying buildings. His carriage is in the carriage\nhouse. He is likely inside.”\nSabon did not look happy.\n“And?” Tamas said.\n“No sign of workers anywhere. It’s a nice day. They should be in the\nvineyards working the fields, exercising the horses. The place is like a ghost\ntown. I—”\nSabon’s next words were cut off by a bullet as it entered his left temple.\nHe fell without a sound, blood spraying across the inside of the carriage.\nThe popping sound of air rifles was followed by the shouts of ambushed\nsoldiers. A bullet ripped through the carriage over Tamas’s head. A horse\nscreamed. He struggled toward the door.\n“Oh no, sir,” Olem said, grabbing his coat.\nTamas pushed Olem away and leaned over the edge of the carriage.\nSabon lay in the mud, dead eyes staring up blankly.\n“Bugger that,” Tamas said.

He swung out the door, analyzing the villa\nin a second. It sprawled across his view. The whitewashed stucco front was\nimmaculate and the high, narrow windows and thick brick of the ancient\nstyle gave the defenders the advantage. There were at least fifty windows\non the front of the building. The air rifles could have been firing from any\n—or all—of them. Tamas caught sight of the barrel of an air rifle and fired\nhis weapon at that window. He pulled himself in, the sound of bullet\nimpacts and ricochets too loud for comfort. He began to reload. “What the\npit…?”\nOlem leapt from the carriage. He turned around and grabbed Tamas by\nthe coat, pulling him after, onto his shoulder, and ran toward the vineyards.\n“To the pit with you!” Tamas said. He grunted as he was thrown to the\nground and felt the pain lance up his leg. Olem dropped down beside him,\npanting hard, rifle in one hand. They were in a ditch, mud squelching under\nTamas’s boots. His leg burned horribly, the pain wrecking his mind. Tamas\nsnatched a powder charge from his pocket and tore it open, emptying the\ncontents into his mouth. He crunched down, chewing the grit with rage,\nignoring the taste of sulfur and the pain in his teeth.\n“What was that?” Tamas demanded.\nOlem glanced over the edge of the ditch. “Carriage has taken seven or\neight hits since we left,” he said.\nTamas didn’t reply. The powder trance was coming on quickly. The\nworld spun for a moment and he gripped the grass to keep from falling off.\nHis senses righted themselves. The crack of rifle shots reached him as his\nmen began returning fire. The sound was chased by the smell of black\npowder. Tamas gasped it in, deepening his powder trance, willing away the\npain in his leg.\n“They have more than a few air rifles,” Olem said. He sneaked a peek\nover the edge of the ditch, then brought his rifle up, aimed, and fired. “At\nleast twenty. Probably more,” he said, dropping down. “And Wardens.”\n“You sure?”\n“Just saw an ugly brute in the window.”\nTamas finished reloading his pistol. The pain from his leg had begun to\nfade to the back of his mind. “Wardens,” he said. “I hate Wardens.” He\nlooked over the hill. The front of the villa looked normal enough, but the\nwindows were open, rifle barrels sticking through. He could see the\ngrotesque shape of Wardens within, aiming down their rifles, as well as the\nbright colors of Charlemund’s bodyguard. He fired his pistol, burning half a\npowder charge to nudge the bullet where he wanted. One of the rifles fell\ninside.\n“Who tipped them off?” Tamas snarled. “There’s a spy among my own\nmen. Among my elite!”\n“We should worry about whether we brought enough men,” Olem said.\n“We have less than a hundred. If he’s got any number of Wardens in there\nalong with his own bodyguard, we could be in trouble.”"

If he’s got any number of Wardens in there\nalong with his own bodyguard, we could be in trouble.”\nVlora suddenly dropped down beside him. “Sir,” she said. “We need to\nretreat. We’re taking heavy losses. I lost two from my carriage just trying to\nget to cover.”\n“Pit,” Tamas said. They didn’t have enough men to take Charlemund. If\nthey retreated, however, he’d be gone within an hour. There was no way\nthey could get back quickly enough with more soldiers. “We’ll button him\nup. He can’t get out. They don’t know whether we have a hundred men or a\nthousand. Vlora, I want you to get out of here. Get back to the garrison. No,\nget to Lady Winceslav’s estate. It’s closer. I want two thousand men from\nthe Wings of Adom here within an hour.”\n“Sir, I’ll send someone.”\n“No, go yourself.” Tamas squeezed his eyes shut and saw Sabon take\nthe bullet to the head all over again. He would not lose another friend this\nday. He slapped her on the shoulder. “That’s an order, soldier. Go!”\nVlora took off running away from the house. Tamas risked another look\nat the villa.\nOne of the carriages had overturned when a wounded horse bolted. The\nanimal had been cut free, and four soldiers huddled behind the carriage,\nreloading desperately. “That’s a bad place for them,” Tamas said. “We need\nto get some cover fire, have them pull back to a ditch or the vineyard.”\nHe’d barely finished the sentence when sorcery ripped through the\noverturned carriage. He turned away, the flash blinding him as men\nscreamed. The carriage was cut in two, the pieces tossed to either side as if\ndiscarded by the hand of a god. The soldiers were shredded, thrown through\nthe air like ribbon. One landed near Tamas’s ditch.\nTamas dropped his pistol and dragged himself over the bank.\n“Sir!”\nThe powder trance pumping through his veins, Tamas barely noticed the\nfeel of cobbles cracking against his knees. He was next to the soldier in just\na second, pulling himself along the ground with his arms. He grabbed the\nsoldier by the leg. A rifle shot went off not far over his head. Olem stood\nover him, teeth gritted, presenting himself as a better target in order to draw\nenemy fire. He reached down, snatched Tamas by the back of his jacket,\nand pulled both Tamas and the soldier back into the ditch.\n“What the pit, sir!” Olem said. “Are you trying to die?”\n“How is he?” Tamas could see now that the soldier had been cut\nthrough directly by the sorcery. His chest was in tatters. It was impossible\nto tell where the flesh ended and the bloody uniform began. Olem put an ear\nnext to his mouth and shook his head.\nSorcery erupted again. Screams came from the vineyard, where a\nnumber of soldiers had found a spot to hide. Tamas gritted his teeth. “It has\nto be Nikslaus,” he said. He reloaded his pistol and looked out of the ditch."

He reloaded his pistol and looked out of the ditch.\n“Where are you, you arrogant son of a whore?” He opened his third eye,\npushed away the dizziness with anger, and scanned the villa.\n“There,” he said. A cluster of bright-colored smudges indicated that the\nsorcerer was hiding in a room not far from the front door, crouched far\nbeneath a window. Tamas gritted his teeth. The brick would stop bullets.\nBut it wouldn’t stop a bounce. He fingered a powder charge. He lay a finger\non the trigger, when a flash of light caught his eye.\n“Mirrors,” he said. “Pit. He’s using mirrors. He’s in a sorcerer’s box.”\n“A what?” Olem said.\n“It’s an armored box. You stuff a sorcerer inside, with a pinhole and a\nset of decent mirrors to see what he’s aiming at, and he can tear up armies\nwithout getting shot by a powder mage. It’s hot and cramped, but it keeps\nthem alive in a melee. Charlemund was ready for this.”\n“Can’t you just shoot the mirror?”\nTamas was already lining up the shot. “He’ll have extra,” he said. His\nrifle bucked in his hand and the bullet shattered the mirror. “But it might\nbuy us some time.”\n“Sir,” Olem said, tugging on his jacket. “They’ve stopped firing.”\nThe sound of powder rifles from his own soldiers was few and far\nbetween, while the pop of air rifles had stopped completely. He gave a\nshaky sigh. How many men had he lost already?\n“Tamas!” a voice shouted from the villa.\n“He might be trying to mark your position, sir,” Olem said.\n“Tamas, we need to talk!”\n“About your execution,” Tamas muttered.\n“Sir.” Olem’s voice held a note of warning. “Careful. We don’t have\nmany men left. We might want to find out what he wants.”\n“Tamas!” Charlemund shouted. “I’ve got Wardens and a sorcerer. We’ll\ntear your men to bits before you have the chance to retreat.”\nTamas took a deep breath, trying to still his rage. Sabon’s body taunted\nhim from the cobbled drive. “I’ll hear him out.”\nOlem put a hand on Tamas’s shoulder when Tamas tried to rise. “Let\nme, sir.” He moved a half dozen feet down the ditch, scooting on his\nstomach. “Hold your fire!” he shouted. He stood up.\n“Where’s your master,” Charlemund called.\n“What do you want?” Olem demanded.\nThere was a pause. “To talk. We must be able to reach some kind of\nagreement. Tamas, I’ll meet you under a flag of truce.”\n“Why should he trust you?” Olem said.\n“You question me, boy?” the arch-diocel roared.\nOlem stared defiantly back at the villa.\n“I swear on the holy vestments, no harm will come to him inside my\nvilla.”\n“Come out here and talk,” Olem said."

I know Tamas too well. I’m a\nman of the Rope.”\nTamas would hang him from that rope. He signaled to Olem. Olem\ndropped back down to his belly and moved over to Tamas.\n“It’s suicide, sir,” he said. “I don’t trust him.”\n“We don’t have enough men to take him,” Tamas said. “He can tear us\napart with Nikslaus in there. We can’t get a clear shot at the sorcerer.”\n“What can you do?”\n“Send for more men. The rest of my cabal. If I can keep him talking\nuntil Andriya, Vidaslav, and Vlora get here…”\n“It will take hours for reinforcements,” Olem said.\n“Regardless…” Tamas watched the villa. Still no sign of Charlemund.\nThe presence of the Wardens and a Kez Privileged was enough for him to\nknow this was no mistake. Charlemund was the traitor. Would he try to talk\nhis way out of this? Did he just want Tamas for a shield? He swore on the\nRope. How much did that mean to a man like him?\n“Give the order for reinforcements,” Tamas said.\nOlem scurried off to a nearby group of soldiers. He returned in a few\nmoments. “Done.”\n“Tamas!” Charlemund called. “I won’t wait all day. Do we keep\nshooting or will you let me explain myself? Be reasonable!”\n“Reason,” Tamas spat. “This bastard betrays me and talks of reason.\nWhat will he say? He was trying to cut some kind of deal with the Kez to\nsave Adro?”\n“He’ll say anything, sir,” Olem said. “Don’t trust any man who\nsurrounds himself with beautiful women. Least of all a priest.”\n“Wise words.”\n“You’re going to go in, aren’t you,” Olem said.\n“Yes.”\n“I’m going with you.”\nTamas opened his mouth.\n“Stuff it in your ass, sir. I’m going with you.” Olem stood up. He\ngestured to a nearby soldier. “Don’t let them leave this place,” he said.\n“Even if they have the field marshal. Shoot to kill.”\nKresimir’s palace was immense. Taniel had never seen its equal, not in\nAdopest or Kez or Fatrasta. He could look down the street and not see the\nend of it. Unlike the other buildings in Kresim Kurga, the rock had not been\nstained black by soot. It was volcanic, as if the mountain had spewed it out\nin one gigantic piece and let it cool, the sides polished enough he could see\nhimself in them. Taniel couldn’t find a single crack, or see the marks of a\nworkman’s tools.\n“It’s a complex,” Del explained as they searched for an entrance.\n“Kresimir’s home on earth. He and the Predeii lived here for decades.”\n“Yes,” Bo said, feeling along the sheer wall. “I remember reading about\nthis place. But how do we get in? Sorcery?”"

Sorcery?”\n“There is an entrance,” Del said.\n“Lions!”\nThe call came from the rear of their small group. Del began to shake\nagain, pressing himself up against the wall. Taniel grabbed him, pushed him\nforward. “Let’s go! Run!” he said.\nHe could see the first one emerge from the street they’d left not long\nago. It scrambled around the corner, padded back feet thumping, front\nclaws scrabbling for purchase on the cobbles. It was three times the size of\na dog, teeth sharp. There was blood on its jaws.\nThey fled, looking for an entrance to the building.\n“They get bored chasing Julene?” Taniel said to Bo as they ran.\n“Or she scared them off,” Bo gasped. He was sucking wind. Taniel\ngrabbed him by the shoulder, pulling him on. More lions followed the first.\nSix in total.\n“Pole!” Taniel said. “If you have a trick ready for these things, pull it\nout!”\nKa poel sprinted on ahead, putting some distance between her and the\n‑\nothers before she came to a stop. She whipped a set of dolls out of her bag.\nThese were not humanlike as they’d been before. These looked like beasts\n—cave lions. She grabbed a pair by the legs and smashed them against the\nvolcanic building.\nOne of the lions howled. It skidded to the ground and pawed at its head.\nKa poel dropped one of the dolls and stomped on it. The downed lion\n‑\nerupted, blood spraying from its body as it was crushed by an unseen hand.\nKa poel returned the other doll to her bag.\n‑\nThe cave lions fell on their crushed companion. Teeth tore, claws\nflashed. One of them took only a mouthful of flesh and then began to run\nagain, streaming blood behind him as he came at Taniel and the Watchers.\n“Wait, that’s too loud!” Taniel said.\nToo late. Fesnik had pulled the trigger. The shot glanced off the lion’s\nhead, bringing it up short in surprise. The sound of the blast echoed through\nthe buildings, interrupting the long silence. A bloom of smoke rose above\nFesnik. The other cave lions paused in their feeding and looked toward\nthem. Taniel swallowed hard. So much for the element of surprise.\nA low whistle rang through the air in the shocked silence following the\ngunshot. Taniel looked around for the source.\nRina held a fluted bone to her mouth. The sound rose, and then was\ngone, as her dogs pricked up their ears.\n“Go,” she said.\nTheir harnesses released, the three big dogs tore toward the feasting\ncave lions. The cave lions barely seemed to notice them, as they’d returned\nto rip at the flesh of their own kind. One screamed in surprise as Kresim hit\nit from the side. The mastiffs didn’t waste time. They went for throats, and\nthe group of lions and dogs turned into a flying fury of fur.\nDespite the cave lions’ size and claws, the dogs had taken them by\nsurprise.

    "text": "the group of lions and dogs turned into a flying fury of fur.\nDespite the cave lions’ size and claws, the dogs had taken them by\nsurprise. They gained the upper hand, dispatching three of the lions faster\nthan Taniel would have thought possible. They ganged up on the other two\nas more cave lions entered the street.\n“Run!” Taniel yelled.\n“Here.” Bo was some distance ahead. He gestured to them furiously.\nThey reached him in a few moments to find a door cut into the solid side of\nthe building. It took two men to push it open, working against the weight of\nthe stone itself and the ages of disuse.\nThe last man came in and they pushed the door shut behind them. There\nwas neither latch nor lock on the inside of the door.\n“Where’s Rina?” Bo asked.\nThey opened the door. Rina stood back in the street, pistol drawn. Her\nwhole body was shaking as the lions leapt onto her dogs.\n“Come on!” Taniel shouted.\n“I’ll not leave them.” Her quiet voice carried clearly.\nBo stepped outside. He lifted one gloved hand and twitched a finger, as\nif tapping on glass.\nA sudden gale ripped through the street. Rina grabbed for her hat as it\nwas lifted off into the sky. The fighting animals separated, their flanks\ncovered in blood, the three dogs still miraculously alive. Every animal\nregarded Bo warily. The wind whipped around them and pushed. The dogs\ntumbled through the air, leaving the cave lions behind. They slammed into\nRina, lifting her up with them. Bo stepped back inside the door. Dogs and\nwoman followed close behind, and the door slammed shut, leaving them in\ndarkness.\nSomething thumped into the door. Taniel put his back to it. He was\njoined by others. The muffled growls of cave lions came from outside.\nSomeone lit a match.\nBo lay on the floor in a heap with the dogs and Rina. One of the dogs\nwhined. Bo and Rina were unconscious—or dead, as far as Taniel knew. By\nthe light of the match Taniel regarded his companions. Their faces were\ncoated in sweat, lined with fear, covered in… what? Ash? Where had that\ncome from? Taniel examined the floor. There was ash there, ancient,\ncoating the floor a foot thick. At some point a fire must have raged through\nthe building, destroying everything inside. Only the shell remained. He\nstared into the faces of his companions. They’d come all this way. For\nwhat? To be hunted like animals by cave lions in a dead city?\nTaniel felt the horrible weight of failure. “Where is Del?” he asked. The\nmonk was nowhere to be seen. Taniel called his name. No answer. A set of\nfootprints in the ash led off toward the center of the building. Taniel heard\nanother thump at the door and the scrabble of claws on wood.\nTaniel, his back still against the door, snorted a pinch of powder. His\nsenses grasped at any light—pinpricks, high above—to let him see. They\nwere in a vast, open space. A dark container that seemed more like a mine\nthan a building. He took a deep breath, trying to keep calm. “This doesn’t\nlook like a palace,” he said."

He took a deep breath, trying to keep calm. “This doesn’t\nlook like a palace,” he said.\n“Taniel!”\nThe voice echoed around them.\n“Del?” Taniel said.\n“Over here, Taniel. Quickly!”\n“Bo’s hurt,” he said.\n“No time. You must come.”\nAnother thump against the door. A cave lion outside whined.\n“Can you hold it?” Taniel asked.\n“Go on,” Fesnik answered. “We’ve got it. Go take the shot.”\n“Stay here,” Taniel said to Ka poel. “Help them keep the door shut.”\n‑\nHe ignored her gesture of defiance and turned to run. The floor was\npolished, perfectly level. It might have been marble beneath the ash. He\ndistanced himself from the light of the burning match behind him and tried\nto follow Del’s voice. He gave up, keeping his eyes on the footprints in the\nash instead. Pinpricks of light from far above gave him just enough light to\nsee in his powder trance.\nHe found Del standing near an enormous staircase of the type built\ninside the ballrooms of kings. It had no railings, and must have been made\nof the same rock as the walls of the palace in order to have survived\nwhatever fire had gutted the building long ago.\n“This doesn’t look like a palace,” Taniel said.\nDel was quaking terribly. He barely seemed able to stand. He held out\nboth hands to Taniel as if to plead. “It was once a mighty place,” he said.\n“Thousands upon thousands of rooms filled with gold and the finest woods\nand carpets. If you had light, you’d see the ashes. Only the husk was created\nfrom hardened rock. Kresimir did that. The inside was built by men, with\nwood and tools. All burned now. All gone.” His voice echoed eerily.\n“No windows?”\n“Come,” Del said. He pointed to the staircase. “We’ve got to get high\nenough to see the coliseum. The solstice is very soon.”\nOlem helped Tamas to his feet and out of the ditch. Tamas straightened his\njacket, brushed off his knees, adjusted his belt. “My sword,” he said. They\nhobbled to the carriage, where Tamas turned his back on the villa and bent\nnext to Sabon’s body. “I’m sorry, my friend,” he said. “My arrogance\nwalked us into this trap. It’s about to walk me into another one. Forgive\nme.”\n“Sir.” Olem handed him his sword and slipped him a sack of powder\ncharges. Enough to kill a whole company.\n“Bullets?” Tamas said.\nOlem patted the breast pocket of his uniform.\nTamas buckled on his sword and turned toward the villa. He took it one\nstep at a time with one hand on his cane and another on Olem’s shoulder.\nLet them think him weak. He was, but they’d think him less than he even\nwas. With each step, Tamas expected to hear the pop of an air rifle or to see\nthe rainbow flash of sorcery. He reached the front door.\n“Not dead yet,” he said.\nOlem gave him a long look. “I’m not reassured.”"

    "text": "the rainbow flash of sorcery. He reached the front door.\n“Not dead yet,” he said.\nOlem gave him a long look. “I’m not reassured.”\nOne of the double doors of the villa opened. A Warden, an air rifle\nunder one arm, stood in the doorway. Olem helped Tamas up the steps and\ninside. He paused in the doorway, letting his eyes adjust to the dimmer\nlight. He counted four Wardens and three Church guardsmen, air rifles\nleveled at him.\nThe foyer was a simple place, white marble covered every inch with\nbuilt in benches on the walls to either side. A single marble bust of\n‑\nCharlemund stood on a half column in the center of the room, a testament to\nhis ego. The minimalism of the foyer couldn’t be taken at face value. Tamas\ncould see off into well-lit rooms full of vibrant color and art, with gold and\nvelvet trim.\n“Leave the door open so that my men can see me safe,” Tamas said to\nthe nearest Warden. The Warden sneered.\nCharlemund entered the foyer from a side room. “Take him,” he said.\nSomeone shut the door behind Tamas. Tamas reached for his sword, but\na Warden grabbed his wrist. Another Warden slammed Olem in the\nstomach with the butt of his air rifle. Olem grunted, dropping to his knees.\nTamas sagged without Olem’s support, the pain of his leg flaring through\nhis powder trance.\n“You call this good faith?” Tamas snarled.\n“I call you a fool,” Charlemund said. “Besides, I didn’t lie. No harm\nwill come to you in my care. I can’t promise the same when you reach\nSouth Pike.”\n“South Pike?”\nCharlemund flattened a crease on the front of his duelist’s uniform with\none hand. “Yes.”\n“What do you mean, South Pike?” Olem said. He began to climb to his\nknees.\n“Silence that dog,” Charlemund said.\nA Warden whipped Olem across the face with his air rifle. Olem fell to\nthe floor, blood spilling from his brow.\nTamas clenched his fists and stopped himself from igniting powder. He\nneeded Nikslaus in the room, too. “You had better hope he’s all right.”\n“I’d like to know what you mean, Your Grace.” Nikslaus came into the\nroom, patting sweat from his brow. His Kez uniform was dirty and wrinkled\nfrom the sorcerer’s box. “Tamas isn’t going to South Pike. He’s going with\nme, to Kez.”\nCharlemund turned to Nikslaus. “Not anymore. Kresimir will arrive\ntoday. The only hope we have of preventing Adro’s complete destruction is\nto take this low-born swine.”\nNikslaus tugged at his Privileged’s gloves. “I don’t follow your\nsuperstitions, Your Excellency, nor do I report to the Church. I report to my\nking, and he wants Tamas’s head on a block.”\n“There will be no Adro left for us to divide if we don’t appease\nKresimir,” Charlemund said.\nNikslaus squeezed his hands into fists. “You won’t get out of this\ncountry without me,” he said."

Tamas leaned on his cane and bent\nover, giving Olem a shoulder to pull himself up by. “Can you stand?”\nOlem’s brow had been split. He wiped some blood from his eyes and\nfelt his temple tenderly. “Send them to the pit, sir.”\nTamas stood up straight and rested both hands on his cane. Nikslaus\nturned toward him, sensing danger. The sorcerer narrowed his eyes.\nTamas felt Nikslaus open his third eye. “He can use his sorcery!”\nNikslaus’s hands flashed up, fingers working through the air.\nTamas lit powder. Olem tossed the bag of bullets into the air, and\nTamas concentrated on that. The bag ripped apart, shredded pieces falling\nto the floor. Bodies dropped, air rifles clattering to the pristine marble,\nblood spraying the walls. Light flashed in front of Nikslaus where bullets\nhit a hastily erected barrier of air.\n“Flee!” Nikslaus screamed. His fingers worked frantically.\nCharlemund stared at Tamas for one moment before he turned and ran.\n“Don’t let him get away,” Tamas said. He couldn’t take his eyes off\nNikslaus. One mistake and Tamas would be dead. He had to keep\nNikslaus’s hands busy. Tamas lit powder, feeding off it in the smallest\namounts, keeping a dozen bullets in the air and spinning. He threw them at\nNikslaus. Nikslaus’s fingers danced nimbly. Tamas’s third eye revealed\nflashes of color as his bullets struck invisible shields. Tamas lit more\npowder, throwing the bullets harder.\nOlem scrambled to his feet. He raced past Nikslaus, sword in hand, only\nto stop as five Church guards rushed into the room. They looked toward\nNikslaus and Tamas, regarded their silent battle, and turned on Olem.\nTamas gripped the head of his cane. His advances were getting closer to\nNikslaus as the sorcerer’s defense weakened. He could only deflect the\nbullets so fast, and Tamas wouldn’t give him the time to erect a better\nbarrier with his sorcery. Tamas flicked his gaze toward Olem. The soldier\nhad taken down one enemy, but there were too many. He was being pushed\nback, almost even with Nikslaus.\nTamas was running out of powder. Charlemund was getting away.\nNikslaus brushed his nose with one of his gloved hands, giving Tamas a\nmoment to whirl a handful of bullets at Olem’s assailants. The bullets went\nthrough eyes and mouths, dropping the men instantly. Olem lunged\nforward, leaping the downed bodies, and took off after Charlemund.\nNikslaus brushed his nose again.\nTamas grinned. “Allergies?”\nNikslaus took a step back.

Sweat began to trickle down his\nbrow as Tamas sent more bullets at him. Each bullet careened away,\ndeflected. Tamas was running out of powder. He sucked in a raw breath, the\nsmell of spent powder sending his blood pumping. The powder trance was a\ndeep one.\nNikslaus flung his hand in a wild gesture and uttered a hoarse cry.\nTamas yelled out as he tumbled to the floor, his concentration broken.\nHe stared at the two halves of his cane, then up at Nikslaus. The Privileged\nadvanced and stood above him. He held his fingers just so, as if he was\nabout to snap them. His shirt was soaked with sweat, his hair wild. He\nlooked down at Tamas. “You old fool.”\n“You win,” Tamas said, lighting a touch of powder.\nNikslaus screamed. He stumbled back, clutching his left hand. He\nslammed into the column with Charlemund’s bust. The bust clattered to the\nfloor, shattering a marble tile, and Nikslaus tripped over the column and fell\nto the ground.\nTamas got to his hands and knees, ignoring the pain in his leg. He used\nthe longer piece of his cane to leverage himself onto one foot. He hopped\nover to Nikslaus. He lit some powder. Nikslaus screamed again as a bullet\nlaced through his right hand, tearing the arcane symbols on his Privileged’s\nglove. Nikslaus stared at his hands, matching bullet holes through the palms\nof each. The white gloves were covered in blood, obscuring the remaining\nrunes.\n“Now you know what it’s like to have your power taken from you,”\nTamas said. He drew his sword and knelt down beside Nikslaus. He took\none of the sorcerer’s hands in his and pulled off the glove. Nikslaus\nwhimpered.\n“Those are some delicate fingers,” Tamas said.\nChapter 39\nAdamat reined in his hired mount at the front gate of the villa. His horse\ntossed its head, sides lathered from the long gallop. Adamat wiped sweat\nfrom his forehead and patted the creature’s flank. He could also see the very\ntop of the villa, and the carriages rumbling toward it.\n“The arch-diocel isn’t taking visitors.” These were Tamas’s men;\nsoldiers in their dark-blue uniforms, lapels stained silver. One of them\ngestured to Adamat with his bayoneted rifle. “Go on,” he said. “Read your\nnewspaper tomorrow.”\nAdamat rested just a moment to get his breath, his mount prancing\nbeneath him.\n“You don’t look like you ride much,” the soldier said with a lopsided\nsmile.\n“I don’t,” Adamat snapped. “I have to warn Field Marshal Tamas.”\nThe soldier’s easy manner disappeared. He stepped close, while his\npartner circled around to Adamat’s other side.\n“Listen,” Adamat said as his horse shied away from the soldier. He\nsawed at the reins. “I’m Adamat, the field marshal’s investigator. Tamas is\nwalking into a trap.”"

Tamas is\nwalking into a trap.”\nThe soldier gave Adamat a hard look. “I’ve heard the name passed\naround,” he said slowly. “Go on. Don’t make an idiot of yourself.”\nAdamat nodded desperately, still breathing hard. He’d not ridden like\nthis since he was at the university.\nThe gate was pushed open and Adamat urged his mount through. They\nwere on the cobblestone drive, and he kneed the poor animal into a gallop.\nHe bent down next to the creature’s neck, white-knuckled grip on the reins.\nThe carriages were to the house now, circled around the fountain in front of\nthe villa.\nRifle shots rang out, startling the horse. It missed a step and stumbled,\npitching sidelong into a ditch. Adamat cried out as he was thrown. He\ncleared the ditch completely, hitting the ground hard, and rolled. A vineyard\npost arrested his roll. He got to his hands and knees, clutching a pain in his\nside.\n“Rosvel’s ass!” There was blood on his hand from some minor cut. He\nwiped it on his coat, pulling himself up and checking his chest and sides.\nNo broken bones, but some mighty bruises. His mount lay on its side in the\nditch, flanks heaving. “You won’t be getting me any farther, will you?”\nThe shots continued. Shouts followed. He was too late. Vetas’s man had\nalready warned the arch-diocel. Adamat closed his eyes. What could he do?\nThis was his fault. He had no rifle—just a pistol and a sword. He returned\nto the drive, eyes cast up toward the house. A carriage had overturned,\nsoldiers had scattered to the vineyard, exchanging fire with unknown\nassailants. No muzzle flashes or powder smoke from the house. What were\nTamas’s men shooting at? He shook his head. Air rifles, of course. Damn it.\nAdamat went back over the ditch and into the vineyard at a run. He gave\nthe house a wide berth, cutting through the vineyards and then back behind\na stable. He glimpsed blue coats here and there, soldiers crouched in cover.\nThe rifle shots were becoming too few and far between. It did not bode\nwell.\nHe leapt a course of firewood and nearly landed on one of Tamas’s\nsoldiers. The man swung his rifle toward Adamat, almost sticking him with\nthe bayonet. He was a young man, unseasoned and more than a little wide-\neyed. “Name!” he demanded, voice quavering.\n“Get that out of my face.” Adamat grabbed the rifle by the barrel,\nshoving it away. “I’m Adamat. Does Tamas have the whole property\ncovered?”\nThe soldier regarded him warily. His hands were shaking. He’d\nprobably never seen live fire before, outside of his drills.\nAdamat grabbed the soldier by the front of his uniform. “You hear those\nshots? They’ve been ambushed in the front. It’s got to be a distraction.\nCharlemund will use that cover to escape.”\nThe soldier hesitated. “I don’t trust you,” he said slowly."

It’s got to be a distraction.\nCharlemund will use that cover to escape.”\nThe soldier hesitated. “I don’t trust you,” he said slowly.\n“Holy pit, look!” Adamat pointed toward the house.\nThe soldier whirled. Adamat brought his elbow down hard on the boy’s\nneck. “Sorry,” he said, taking the rifle. He pushed the boy’s unconscious\nform up against the firewood stack and looked about, trying to spot more of\nTamas’s soldiers. He caught sight of one near the edge of the house,\ncreeping about toward the front—more concerned about his comrades in the\nfirefight than with anyone escaping out the back.\n“Damn it, I’m going to be doing this alone.” He ran, half crouching,\nuntil he was fully behind the villa. He stopped behind a shed and listened.\nThe shots had stopped. He ducked around the shed for a look. The back of\nthe villa was an open portico, a sun garden with large parasols and awnings\nfor shade. There was a thin gravel maintenance drive. A single-horsed\ncarriage waited in the drive, with a familiar, miserable-looking driver.\nTamas checked for guards—there were none. He ran forward.\n“Siemone,” he said. The driver looked up. The young priest had a\nstricken look about his face—he was disturbed enough that he forgot to\navoid looking Adamat full in the face. For a moment.\n“What are you doing here?” Siemone said, averting his eyes. “Get out,\nbefore the arch-diocel sees you.”\n“You’re helping him escape,” Adamat said. He grabbed the horse by the\nbridle.\n“I have to,” Siemone said. He clutched the reins tight.\n“No, you don’t. He’s an evil man, a traitor. Don’t help him.”\n“You don’t think I know?” Siemone said. The words came out a sob.\n“I’ve known all along. I’m sorry I paid those men to kill you. Please\nunderstand, I could do nothing. I can’t be free of him. I’m glad you’re still\nalive. Now, get out of here before he comes. He’ll cut you down.”\nAdamat took a deep breath. “Siemone,” he said, stepping forward.\n“Don’t come another step,” the priest warned.\nAdamat paused. “Please, Siemone.” He inched forward.\n“Guards!” Siemone called. “Quickly!”\nA pair of men rushed from the back of the house. They wore the garb of\nChurch guards, and drew their swords at the sight of Adamat.\nPrielight Guards. Elite soldiers in the employ of the Church. They\nprotected the arch-diocels with their lives. If they got close to Adamat, he\nwouldn’t stand a chance. Adamat stepped back and took the rifle in both\nhands, hoping it was loaded.\nHe aimed for the first guard and squeezed the trigger. The shot\nresounded in the yard. The man took a few more steps and stumbled to his\nknees. The second ran past him, coming fast. Adamat threw down the rifle\nand drew his pistol.

He\ngrunted, a look of frustration on his face, and dropped. The first guard had\nslowly gotten to his feet. He swayed drunkenly. Adamat drew his sword\nand stepped forward. The man managed to parry four or five thrusts before\nAdamat landed a disabling blow.\n“Siemone!” someone shouted. “We fly!”\nAdamat turned. Charlemund ran from the back of the villa, cape over\none arm, sheathed sword in the other.\n“Go,” Adamat said. “Go without him! You can do it, Siemone!”\nThe priest squeezed his eyes shut and began to pray. Adamat swore,\nwhirled toward Charlemund.\n“You!” the arch-diocel grunted, stopping just inside the garden. He\nglanced over his fallen guards in disgust.\nAdamat stepped forward, between Charlemund and the carriage. The\npistol had been his only chance. Charlemund was the best swordsman in the\nNine. He’d tear Adamat apart. Adamat raised his sword and swallowed\nhard.\nCharlemund plucked at the string around his neck and tossed his cape\naside. He drew his sword and cast away the sheath.\nThe attack came faster than Adamat could have imagined. Adamat\nparried by instinct only—he’d been considered a fine fencer long ago, but\nthose years were past and he’d wielded little more than a cane sword since.\nAdamat fell back beneath the advance. He skipped away, retreating fast.\nThe arch-diocel came on relentlessly, a stab here, a slash there, the tip of his\nsword mere inches from Adamat’s face and chest.\n“A fine fencer” was a relative term against someone like Charlemund.\nAdamat felt worthless, like a child at his first lesson. These were no wooden\ntraining swords, though. When Charlemund flicked forward, effortlessly, he\ndrew blood. The initial cuts were merely scratches and pricks. Enough of\nthose would leave a man dead as sure as a plunge through the heart.\nCharlemund slapped Adamat’s sword away with the tap of his own and\nstepped forward. He thrust twice. Adamat stumbled backward to avoid the\nstabs. He recovered his footing and tried to raise his sword. His arm would\nnot obey him. A quick glance down saw the red stains spreading in two\ndark circles on his coat. One was just over his heart, the other on his\nshoulder. Adamat felt his body sag, weakened by the sudden anticipation of\ndeath.\nCharlemund spun away from Adamat, barely parrying a sword thrust.\nTamas’s bodyguard pressed upon the arch-diocel, attacking with ferocity.\nCharlemund danced away from Adamat and Olem, into the middle of the\ngravel walk for clear footing. Olem sprinted after him, sword first, not\ngiving him a moment’s respite.\nAdamat stumbled to a rock in the garden and sat down. He gripped his\nsword weakly with one hand, checked his wounds with the other. He\nshoved his fist into the worst of his two wounds.

    "text": "shoved his fist into the worst of his two wounds. His head spun, though he\ncouldn’t be sure whether it was because of his losing blood that fast or if it\nwas simply from the excitement of the duel and the prospect of death. He\nwatched Olem with a light-headed exhilaration. If Olem fell, Charlemund\nwould kill them both and make his escape.\nOlem was clearly a better fighter than Adamat. He went at Charlemund\nwith the reckless bravery of a soldier, a man whose life was dedicated to the\nsword and the gun. Olem’s swordsmanship was less controlled than the\narch-diocel’s, less clinical, but he made up for that in savagery. His teeth\nwere clenched, his eyes lit with anger, determination, his off hand balanced\ncarefully in the air over his hip. Charlemund took a few more steps back,\nthe onslaught catching him off guard, before he regained his footing and\nbegan to press his own attack.\nAdamat watched as Charlemund studied Olem’s patterns, tracking every\nmovement carefully. His face lacked Olem’s sense of determination—it\ncontained the quiet, reserved watchfulness of a student in his favorite class.\nOlem’s thrusts slowly became easier for Charlemund to counter, his parries\nless effective. Charlemund wasn’t just fighting, Adamat realized. He was\nlearning as he went, adapting to Adamat’s moves. This was how a master\ndueled, and Adamat had never seen anything like it. Olem continued to lose\nground.\nThe duel could have been hours, as Adamat felt it, though he knew that\nonly moments had passed. Olem retreated farther, and the two duelists\nmoved past Adamat and closer to the carriage. Olem held his ground there\nfor several seconds, sweat beading on his brow, eyes desperate for some\nopening. His face was easy for Adamat to read. He was growing tired,\nworried. He could not keep up with Charlemund.\nHe saw one, finally, and lunged. His cut nicked Charlemund’s side as\nthe arch-diocel stepped aside. A dagger appeared in Charlemund’s off hand,\nand he stabbed Olem between the ribs. Olem’s eyes widened, his sword\nfalling from his hand. Charlemund stepped away and drew his sword back\nfor a finishing thrust.\nAdamat looked away. We’re finished.\nOlem coughed out a laugh, drawing Adamat’s attention. Charlemund\npaused.\n“You’ve worse than me to face,” Olem said.\nCharlemund gave a quick glance toward the villa. He left Olem in the\ndirt and ran for the carriage. “Go!” he said, leaping onto the sideboard.\n“Don’t do it!” Adamat called to Siemone.\nThe priest huddled on the driver’s bench, reins in hand. His arms shook.\nHe didn’t move.\n“Go,” Charlemund commanded.\nAdamat thought Siemone was about to snap the reins. The priest looked\ntoward the heavens, then at his hands. His lips moved silently.\n“Fool,” Charlemund said. He swung up the sideboard and into the seat\nnext to Siemone.\nThe priest cringed away from him. “I can’t do it,” he wailed."

He swung up the sideboard and into the seat\nnext to Siemone.\nThe priest cringed away from him. “I can’t do it,” he wailed.\nCharlemund pushed him from the seat. Siemone gave a yell and\ntumbled from his perch. He hit the ground with the sound of a melon being\nsplit open and then lay still.\n“Coward.”\nThe word wasn’t spoken loudly, yet it drew Charlemund and Adamat’s\ngazes all the same. Tamas stood on the back step of the villa, just above the\ngarden. He leaned heavily on an air rifle, barrel down, in place of his cane.\nHe looked like an old man then, tired and beleaguered. The front of his\nuniform was soaked in blood. Adamat remembered the mage’s quarters in\nSkyline Palace, and the specks that had covered Tamas then. He shuddered.\nCharlemund hesitated. The reins were in his hands, and though he\nobviously wanted to snap them and make a run for it some kind of morbid\ncuriosity held him back.\nAdamat forced himself to his feet. He stumbled, winced at the pain, his\nhead feeling light. He snagged the horse’s bridle. “No,” he said.\nCharlemund barely seemed to notice him. The arch-diocel’s eyes were\non Tamas.\n“I see you’ve taken care of the good duke,” Charlemund said. He stood\nup, dropping the reins, and jumped from the driver’s bench. He landed in a\ncrouch, stood up, and straightened. Adamat felt his heart beat faster.\nTamas seemed unimpressed. “He’s still alive,” he said. “He wishes he\nwasn’t. I have a lot of plans for him.” Tamas took the steps down into the\ngarden slowly, leaning on the air rifle. “For you, too,” he said.\nCharlemund drew his sword. “You’re out of powder,” he said.\n“Otherwise we wouldn’t be talking. You’re not afraid of my title, of the\nrepercussions. You’d have put a bullet in my head from inside the house.\nDid Nikslaus use up all your reserves?”\nTamas’s face was iron.\n“If you had any honor at all,” Charlemund said, “you’d be on your way\nto South Pike right now to sacrifice yourself to Kresimir in hopes of saving\nthis country.”\n“That’s rich,” Tamas said. “Coming from a traitor.”\n“What are you going to do to me, Tamas?” Charlemund said. “On your\nbest day you aren’t the swordsman I am.” Charlemund broke into a sudden\nsprint, rushing headlong toward Tamas, arms thrown back like the wings of\na bird of prey.\nTamas let the air rifle drop from beneath his arm. He drew his sword,\nplanting his bad leg back, wincing as he did so. Adamat took a sharp breath.\nThat leg had been shattered. Tamas wouldn’t be able to maneuver. On a\ngood day, he may have come close to matching Charlemund. As it was, a\nduel would be laughable.\nCharlemund lunged forward, thrusting savagely as he closed with"

Tamas parried, their blades crossed, and Charlemund was behind\nTamas, spinning to give a death-dealing blow before Tamas could bring\nhimself around on the bad leg. Charlemund’s shout of victory died in his\nthroat, his eyes falling toward his sword.\nThe black smoke of gunpowder hung in the air by Tamas’s off hand. He\nopened his fist and let the burned wrappings of a powder charge fall to the\nground, next to the blade of Charlemund’s sword. Charlemund stared at his\nswordless hilt. His face twisted in fury, eyes alight. He threw the hilt and\nleapt toward Tamas, who’d turned slowly to face him.\nThe thrown hilt hit Tamas’s forehead, leaving a shallow cut. He\nblinked, and thrust forward once, his off hand on his hip in a duelist’s pose.\nCharlemund’s own momentum carried him a handspan onto the steel.\nTamas pulled back, stabbed again, then again. Charlemund stumbled away,\nclutching at the wounds, the crimson soaking into his pristine uniform. He\nstaggered up against the carriage, one hand reaching, grasping at nothing.\nHe slid down onto the gravel.\nAdamat swallowed hard. Charlemund’s wounds didn’t look fatal, but\nthere were several of them. He’d bleed out slowly, painfully—if Tamas let\nhim. Tamas didn’t make any move to help, nor call out for his soldiers. He\nsimply watched as Charlemund tried to stem the blood flow, hands shaking.\nTamas wiped the blood from his sword on Charlemund’s discarded cape\nand sheathed it.\nAdamat’s own wounds were bad, but he judged them survivable if he\nbound them better. He shrugged the thought off and went to squat down\nbeside Siemone’s limp body. The priest’s neck had been broken in the fall.\nHis eyes stared sightlessly off into a pasture, mouth open in a cry of\ndespair. Adamat closed the eyes with his fingertips. He stood up and\nwalked around to the other side of the carriage.\nOlem and Tamas leaned upon each other, heads together in a\nconference. Tamas once again held the air rifle as a cane. They both looked\nto Adamat. “Olem says you delayed Charlemund just long enough for him\nto catch up.” Tamas gave him a slow nod. “You have my thanks.”\nAdamat licked dry lips. Neither had a look of suspicion, an accusation\non their lips. Why not? Adamat’s warning to Lord Vetas had just caused the\ndeaths of a number of Tamas’s soldiers. They had yet to realize why he was\nthere at all.\n“Sir,” Adamat said. “I’m sorry. But my family…”\nTamas returned to the inside of the manor. Wardens and Church guards lay\nabout, dead.

He found an ivory parasol stand in the\ncorner of the foyer and appropriated a real cane, leaning the air rifle up\nagainst the wall.\nNikslaus was gone. Tamas bit the inside of his cheek, fighting against\nwelling frustration. He’d left the Privileged lying on the ground writhing in\npain. A blood trail led from that spot off to a side room. Tamas didn’t have\nenough men to tend to the wounded and organize a search. He closed his\neyes and limped off after the blood trail.\nAdamat. What would Tamas do with the inspector? He’d confessed to\nbetraying Tamas and Adro to this Lord Vetas and his master, Lord\nClaremonte. How many powerful enemies could Tamas have? Adamat was\nultimately responsible for Sabon’s death. Or was he? According to Adamat,\nthe warning was sent to Charlemund just ahead of Adamat himself.\nCharlemund had more than just a few moments to marshal his defenses.\nThe pain in his leg increased as his powder trance began to fade. It\nwould take a while for the trance to fade completely, and he’d be able to\nstand for a few hours yet, with the help of a cane. When that time was over,\nthe agony would be so great he’d be lucky to even be able to stand.\nDr. Petrik would be furious. Tamas may have damaged his leg\nirreparably, fighting on it like he did. Foolishness.\nThe blood trail led through two rooms, two separate worlds of\nexpensive furnishings rarely seen outside of a king’s palace. Ivory-bone\nchairs from the horns of Fatrastan animals, pelts and taxidermied big cats\nfrom the farthest jungles. A squat table chiseled from a single piece of pure\nobsidian. The skeleton of a long-dead lizard as big as a horse. Artwork from\nevery corner of the world, sculptures from before the Time of Kresimir.\nThe blood trail led to a servant’s door out onto a small patio. Tamas\nexamined the area cautiously. He didn’t know if they’d accounted for all the\nWardens. He glimpsed movement out across a pasture. A stable door\nopened, and a pair of horses galloped out, swinging out around the barn and\naway from the villa. In his powder trance Tamas could see the makeshift\nbandages on Nikslaus’s hands, the writhing muscles of the Warden who led\nhis horse. Nikslaus glanced back toward the villa nervously. Tamas\nwatched until the pair was out of sight.\nAll of this was for naught if Julene manages to summon Kresimir.\n“I can’t find Nikslaus,” Olem said.\nTamas turned. The soldier had not even attended to his own wounds. He\nstood straight as he could, trying to meet Tamas’s eyes. He did not hide his\npain well, which meant there was a lot of it. He fumbled in his shirt jacket\nfor rolling paper and tobacco. They almost slipped out of his blood-slick\nfingers. Tamas took them from him and rolled Olem a cigarette, then lit it\nwith a match from Olem’s breast pocket. Olem took a puff and smiled\ngratefully."

You did well, my friend.”\n“But Nikslaus…” Olem said.\n“My vengeance will be that he continues to live,” Tamas said. He\nsmiled, and he knew it was tinted with cruelty. “That will be enough.”\nChapter 40\nOnly aftepr climbing stairs for what seemed like hours did Taniel realize\nthe full scope of Kresimir’s palace. It was, as Del said, a husk—the giant\nshell of what must have once been thousands upon thousands of rooms and\nhalls and galleries. Only the volcanic outer crust remained, along with the\nenormous staircase that spiraled up along the inner wall. The ash thinned as\nthey ascended. Their footfalls began to echo, and Taniel soon realized that\nthe pinpricks of light above were windows. He forced himself to climb\nhard, fast, not caring if Del kept up or not.\nIn the near-utter silence Taniel felt as if time were suspended. He\nthought he saw pale colors flicker in the shadows, like ghostly auras of\nlong-dead magic. Every now and then, puffs of ash rose like phantoms. As\nthey neared the top, he saw windows, yes, but they were too high above the\nstaircase to shoot from, and there was nothing to climb to reach them. He\nkept going. The walls closed in around them and the staircase narrowed.\nThey reached a platform, bathed in light, blackened by soot, and as wide as\na ballroom. Taniel saw the roof arch above them and the slits of windows\nhigh up the walls.\nTaniel slumped against the wall and waited for Del to catch up.\n“Where?” Taniel asked when the monk arrived, panting. He lurched\nforward and grabbed Del by the hem of his robes. “Where? You said I\ncould shoot from up here. Point me to some damn windows!” He shook the\nmonk hard.\n“There!” Del wailed. He closed his eyes and flung a hand over Taniel’s\nshoulder.\nTaniel let go of Del and turned around. A chill crept over him as he\nreevaluated the room. A cold hand seemed to touch his heart.\nThis was Kresimir’s throne room. A dais lay at the end of the hall,\nthirteen steps up to a place where sat a blackened chair. He saw light behind\nthat chair.\nTaniel hurried up the dais steps. He passed the empty throne and found\na doorless archway. He gathered his courage and entered.\nThe room beyond brought him to a sudden stop. He gasped, mind\novercome. The room was well lit, fully furnished. Tapestries hung on the\nwalls. There was glass in the windows, and a four-poster bed in the center\nof the room. Velvet-cushioned chairs and gold-rimmed tables. He’d tracked\nsoot onto a white rug. Taniel might as well have stepped from a cave into\nSkyline Palace. He stumbled.\n“You left Bo behind?” a female voice said."

Julene stepped in from a balcony.\n“Yes, ma’am.” Del appeared at Taniel’s shoulder.\n“And the girl?” Julene said, a sneer on her lips.\n“Guarding Bo.” Del stood straight, his head held high. He no longer\nshook. He no longer even looked like Del. The youth of his face faded,\nleaving wrinkles behind, and as Taniel watched, the false monk pulled a\npair of Privileged’s gloves from his pocket and tugged them on.\nJulene strode to Taniel. She put one finger under his chin and lifted up\nhis head to look into his eyes. He felt ill. Dead inside.\n“I had a feeling you might chase me up here,” she said. “Glad I left\nJekel behind. What was his plan?” she asked the Privileged.\n“Shoot enough of us to keep you from summoning Kresimir,” Jekel\nsaid.\n“That might have worked,” Julene admitted. “It takes a lot of sorcery to\npull Kresimir between the Nether that separates worlds.”\nTaniel felt himself sway. He longed to snatch for a pistol. He might be\nable to at least kill the false monk. His fingers didn’t want to obey. He was\ndefeated. He knew it.\n“Why?” Taniel asked. He took a couple of breaths, trying to find the\nwords.\n“Summon Kresimir?” Julene rolled her eyes.\n“No. Why this dog? Why the ruse? He could have just as easily waited\nand killed us all. Why not kill me now?”\nJulene shrugged. “If your father manages to survive the coming pitfire, I\nwill keep you as some leverage. He’s not resourceful, but he is stubborn.”\nTaniel tried to come to terms with what she was saying. “Just kill me\nnow,” he said.\nShe tapped his neck with long nails. “I will if I need to.” She raised one\nhand. Taniel closed his eyes. After a moment, he opened them, only to\nreceive an open-handed slap. He felt her nails rake at his skin.\n“That’s for throwing me off a cliff,” she said. She turned to go.\nTaniel twitched his fingers. They would move. Good. What could he\ndo? “Going to summon Kresimir?” he asked.\nJulene chuckled. “Already done,” she said. “I’m going to watch him\ndescend. Care to come with me? The last time he touched earth, he\ncollapsed half the mountain. You might want to find some protection in my\nsorcery.”\nJekel ducked after Julene with a look of concern. Taniel blinked. He set\nhis fingers on his pistol, then followed after them.\nThe balcony was full of people. Two dozen Privileged, if not more.\nThey held their eyes to the sky. Taniel was at the peak of the mighty\nbuilding—or as close as one could get. He nudged his way among the\nPrivileged and looked over the side.

Taniel tossed him off the balcony.\nThe man’s scream lasted a long time, even as he bounced and slid down\nthe outside of the giant sheen of volcanic rock that was the building’s shell.\n“What?” someone asked.\n“Who the pit is this?” a Privileged said.\nTaniel drew a pistol and then wondered what for. What damage could\nhe possibly do? Out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of a glowing\nlight, up in the clouds. He felt the blood drain from his face. He tightened\nhis grip on his pistol. He could at least take a few of them with him.\nA Privileged raised his gloved hands at Taniel. His fingers twitched.\nTaniel whipped up his pistol, only to hesitate as the Privileged suddenly—\nand apparently gleefully—threw himself off the balcony.\nAnother Privileged followed suit. Then a third collapsed to the ground\nscreaming, gouging at his eyes. Taniel whirled toward the balcony entrance.\nKa poel stood there, legs planted wide, arms spread. Her buckskin vest\n‑\nwas loosened sloppily at the neck, and her rucksack lay at her feet. Dolls\nlay scattered around it. Her fire-red hair was wild. She raised one hand.\nThe dolls, dozens of them, rose into the air. They spread out before her\nlike cards before a soothsayer, held up by invisible hands. Julene caught\nsight of Ka poel, and she screamed.\n‑\nEverything happened at once. Privileged scrambled for their gloves and\nmade warding gestures. Julene froze, as if in a panic, and Ka poel began her\n‑\nattack.\nFire spread from her fingertips. It hit several of the dolls, and Privileged\nburst into flames. A needle appeared in Ka poel’s hand. She jabbed hard,\n‑\nquickly, into different dolls. Screams of agony filled the balcony.\nA flash of light raced toward Ka poel as a Privileged got off a shot. She\n‑\ndidn’t even waver. The light arced, flashing into a doll. The Privileged to\nTaniel’s right turned to dust and blew away with the wind.\nThe mongoose had found the serpent’s nest, and Taniel was right in the\nbloody middle. He lifted his pistol and shot a Privileged that wasn’t getting\nany attention from Ka poel. He tossed the pistol aside and grabbed his\n‑\nsecond. When that was spent, he rolled his rifle off his shoulder.\nJulene regained her faculties as Ka poel decimated the Privileged.\n‑\nJulene balled her fists and strode toward Ka poel, face twisted in fury.\n‑\nTaniel felt fear then, and it wasn’t for himself. Turn her unfamiliar magics"

Turn her unfamiliar magics\nas she might against the Kez Privileged, Ka poel would not be able to\n‑\nhandle Julene.\nTaniel rushed Julene, bayonet forward. She waved her hand, and he felt\nhimself sail through the air. Something crunched as he crashed into the\nbalcony railing. He’d barely arrested his own fall, scrambling for some\nhandhold, his rifle clattering away across the balcony. Privileged lay dead\nand dying around Julene, and she strode on toward Ka poel.\n‑\nKa poel’s dolls melted as Privileged died. Some wavered and dropped,\n‑\nstill others drifted away. She twirled her hands, and the remaining dolls\nrotated. Taniel recognized Julene’s doll.\nJulene laughed fiercely as Ka poel massaged the air above the doll.\n‑\nKa poel opened her mouth.\n‑\n“Taniel, run!”\nThe voice had come from Julene, yet it had not been her voice. It was a\ngirl’s voice, a voice tinged by desperation.\n“Get out now!”\nJulene didn’t seem to notice that she’d spoken. She put down her head\nand charged Ka poel, fire flinging from her fingertips, setting alight all it\n‑\ntouched—stone and flesh alike. It sprayed some of Ka poel’s dolls, and two\n‑\nPrivileged wailed in agony.\nTaniel found his rifle in the other corner of the balcony. The remaining\nPrivileged didn’t even seem to notice him. They had backed away as far as\nthey could from Ka poel, spread out, and threw their hands up frantically to\n‑\nfend off her magic.\nNo, he would not run. He’d not leave Ka poel to fight alone.\n‑\nTaniel snatched up his rifle. He checked the barrel. The bullet had come\nout in his fall. He cleared the barrel and loaded one, then another, both\nredstripes. He rammed cotton batting to hold the bullets in. A Privileged\nstumbled toward him, hands raised. He rammed his bayonet through the\nPrivileged’s eye.\nHe found a place at the railing to line up his shot. The glow he’d seen\nearlier was descending from the heavens. It looked like a cloud, falling\nswiftly as it grew closer.\nThe cloud flew past, lowering itself into the center of the coliseum\nbelow. Taniel licked his lips. He cleared his throat. He tried to steady his\nhands. A pinch of powder helped to clear his mind and sharpen his eyes.\nThe coliseum was too far away. Six miles, at least. There was no way he\ncould make a shot that far. He took a deep breath. The cloud touched the\nground.\nA foot emerged from the cloud, followed by a person. Taniel fought off\nthe darkness of a fainting spell.\nThe man from the cloud was more beautiful than anyone Taniel had\never seen. His skin was perfect, his golden hair long and lustrous. He wore\na tunic, something out of a play depicting the Time of Kresimir. He stepped\nfrom the cloud and paused. His perfect face was marred by a frown."

    "text": "a tunic, something out of a play depicting the Time of Kresimir. He stepped\nfrom the cloud and paused. His perfect face was marred by a frown.\nTaniel blinked the sweat out of his eyes and pulled the trigger. The\ncrack echoed in his ears, and he lowered his rifle. He didn’t so much see as\nhe felt the two bullets speeding toward Kresimir. Long after they should\nhave fallen to the ground, his will kept them in the air. His mind began to\nhurt from the effort, his hands began to tremble. Pain blossomed in his head\nas he burned through his powder horn to keep the bullets flying. Still he\nheld on.\nOne bullet entered Kresimir’s right eye. The other hit his chest and\npierced his heart. Taniel watched the god’s body crumple and fall.\nTaniel felt a sob wrench itself from his chest. He’d killed a god.\nHe dropped to the balcony floor.\nHe couldn’t bring himself to care as Julene’s roar of fury tore at his\nbrain. He heard a mighty thump, and then the world began to shake. He\ncradled his rifle, trying to pull himself into a fetal position. The building\nwas falling. I killed a god.\nKa poel. Was she still alive? He staggered to his feet, casting aside his\n‑\nrifle. Ka poel was nowhere to be seen. Julene was gone too. The building\n‑\ncreaked and swayed beneath him. Another quake? Outside, in the middle of\nPike Lake, a great geyser sprayed into the air. Taniel could feel the heat\nfrom it. He forced himself inside.\nKa poel lay near the arched doorway to the throne room. Blood leaked\n‑\nfrom her mouth and nose and from the corner of one eye. She stared up at\nTaniel, still gripping one of her dolls. It was Julene, clear as day, and the\ndoll wore a mask of absolute rage.\nTaniel fell to his knees beside Ka poel.\n‑\n“I can’t take you anywhere safe,” he said. “There’s nowhere safe left. I\nkilled a god.”\nKa poel blinked. Taniel choked on his own sob.\n‑\n“Pole?”\nShe smiled, reached up, and grabbed him by the back of the neck and\npulled him close to her, stronger than Taniel could have imagined.\nThat’s when he felt the building fall out from under them.\nEpilogue\nBloody pit, Olem thought as they brought in the bodies and laid them before\nTamas.\nRain beat down and wind whipped at the canvas tent over their heads.\nThe sounds in the air—screams like banshees that came from no mortal\nthroat—and the smell of sulfur that clogged his senses and made him want\nto spit every few minutes.\nHe could see South Pike from time to time through the swaying trees.\nThe whole mountain, no, the whole southeastern sky, glowed like the\nhillside behind a fire. It made him nervous being this close, no matter what\nthe field marshal said. The mountain had changed. Its familiar rimmed top\nhad collapsed on the southern side, spilling out its fiery guts onto the Kez\nplains.\nOlem hoped it swallowed the whole damned Kez army.\nPlumes of ash and smoke as big as Adro floated in the air above them,"

    "text": "plains.\nOlem hoped it swallowed the whole damned Kez army.\nPlumes of ash and smoke as big as Adro floated in the air above them,\nreflecting the harsh flow of the mountain. The ash rained down, requiring\nevery man to wear cloth over his face. A plume of fire spurted from the\nsouthern rim and disappeared, heading toward Kez. Olem shuddered. That\none plume was probably big enough to cover a city.\nShouldercrown was gone, swept away when the mountain’s side gave\nway. The last of the evacuees had just come into Tamas’s camp. It seems\nthat they’d gotten all of the Mountainwatchers out in time. They’d brought\nwith them the survivors of the mountaintop battle along with rumors that\ncould shake a man’s soul.\n“Are they dead?” Olem asked. He touched a new cigarette to the brazier\nand brought it to his lips, pulling in the sweet smoke. Dr. Petrik shot Olem a\ndirty look. Olem grimaced. He should watch himself. This was the field\nmarshal’s son he was talking about.\nThere were three bodies, all bundled head to toe to protect them from\nthe falling ash. One of them was alive for certain. He was a medium-sized\nman, emaciated and frail-looking. He was carried in on a stretcher, and his\nhands and feet were very clearly bound. His arms stuck out from his body,\npropped up by a forked stick so that his bare hands could be seen at all\ntimes. Privileged Borbador, Olem guessed. The last of the king’s royal\ncabal. Bo’s eyes searched the room. His mouth was not gagged, yet he did\nnot speak.\nThe two other bodies belonged to a young man and woman. Soldiers\nunwrapped the coverings so that Dr. Petrik could examine them. The\nwoman—no, girl, from her size—was a savage with freckled skin and hair\nthat might have been fire red had it not been singed to hardly anything.\nOlem couldn’t tell if she was breathing. The boy was Taniel. Olem\nrecognized him well enough. All of Tamas’s soldiers did.\nOlem sidled up beside the Privileged’s stretcher and pulled up a stool.\n“Bad up there?” Olem said. He grimaced at the pain from his chest. The\nwound from Charlemund had been straight and clean, making it possible\nfor Mihali to heal it with sorcery Olem couldn’t comprehend. Healed it\nmight be, but it still hurt between his ribs.\nBo gave him a glance.\n“Cigarette?” Olem wrapped a new cigarette and put it between Bo’s\nlips. He lit it with a match. Bo breathed in the smoke and coughed. Olem\ncaught the cigarette, put it back in Bo’s mouth. Bo gave a slight nod.\n“I hear we got all of our boys out,” Olem said. “Before the mountain\nfell. That’s lucky.”\nBo said nothing.\n“Rumors of a great sorceress up there, duking it out with you and\nTaniel. She survive?”\n“Don’t know.” It was barely a whisper, muttered from between Bo’s\nclenched lips so the cigarette wouldn’t fall."

She survive?”\n“Don’t know.” It was barely a whisper, muttered from between Bo’s\nclenched lips so the cigarette wouldn’t fall.\n“That’s a pity,” Olem said. “If she did, let’s hope she’s on the Kez side\nof the mountain.”\nBo didn’t respond.\nA man came into the tent then. He might as well have been a bear, for\nhis size and the furs on his shoulders. He wore the emblem of the\nWatchmaster on his vest. Olem didn’t recognize him.\nTamas left his son’s side for a moment. “Jakola,” Tamas said in\ngreeting to the Watchmaster.\n“How’s the boy?” Jakola asked.\n“Alive. Barely.”\n“A miracle,” Jakola said. “You thank that girl, and give her as much\nattention as you show Taniel. If he survives, he’ll owe her his life. Pit, from\nwhat the men are telling me, we all might owe her our lives.”\nTamas looked over to the savage girl. “She clings on even weaker than\nTaniel. I don’t know what we can do for her.”\n“Well, do it,” Jakola said. “You’ve got more surgeons than just this old\nhoot.” He crossed the room to Tamas’s cot and sat down, producing a flask\nfrom his vest pocket.\nOlem frowned. Should he rebuke the man? He looked three times\nOlem’s size. Sabon was the only one Olem had seen speak to the field\nmarshal like that and get away with it.\n“Jakola,” Olem said. “That name sounds familiar.”\nBo gave a slight shake of the head. “I know him as Gavril.”\nOlem took the cigarette from Bo’s lips and tapped the ashes off. He put\nit back in Bo’s mouth. “Jakola,” Olem said. “Jakola, Jakola. Hmm. Wait.\nJakola of Pensbrook!” He felt his eyes widen. “That’s him?”\n“Don’t ask me,” Bo said.\nOlem settled back on his stool and smoked his cigarette, trying to\nremember the rumors passed down through the troops. They said Jakola\nwas one of Tamas’s closest friends. Some said it was his dead wife’s\nbrother. Olem wondered if there was truth to that. Jakola hadn’t been heard\nfrom for longer than Olem had been in the army.\nTamas limped over and squatted next to Bo’s cot. He had refused to let\nMihali heal him until he had Taniel to safety. His leg was bad, getting\nworse, but his stubbornness remained.\n“I have some questions for you,” Tamas said.\nOlem removed the cigarette from Bo’s mouth so he could answer.\n“What happened up there?” Tamas said.\nBo stared glumly at the field marshal. He did not look like he’d speak\nany time soon.\n“I’m not going to execute you,” Tamas said. “Not yet, anyway. This\nstuff”—he gestured to the ropes—“is a precaution. I suspect the gaes still\nholds you?”\nBo nodded.\n“Then you and Taniel were not able to find a way to destroy it?”\n“We’ve spent the last few months trying to throw back the Kez,” Bo\nsaid. His voice was rough. “We haven’t had time.”"

His voice was rough. “We haven’t had time.”\n“When will the gaes kill you?” Tamas said.\n“I don’t know.”\nTamas considered this. “For now, you remain as thus. We’ll try to make\nyou comfortable. I know your compulsion to kill me is not your fault.”\nBo didn’t look relieved.\n“What happened up there?” Tamas asked again. “Did Taniel really\nshoot Kresimir?”\n“Yes,” Bo said.\n“Did you see it happen?”\n“I felt it happen,” Bo said. “Every Privileged in the Nine felt it happen.\nIt tore through my soul. Did you feel it?”\nTamas shook his head. “Olem, did you feel anything?”\n“No, sir,” Olem said. He puffed on Bo’s cigarette to keep it lit. “Though\nI might have. Been having indigestion since eating road rations. I miss\nMihali’s cooking.”\n“You’d have felt it,” Bo said.\nTamas leaned back, wincing in pain. “So Kresimir is dead,” he said. He\nheld on to the edge of the stretcher to stay steady.\nOlem frowned. “Where’s your crutch, sir?”\nBo began to chuckle. It was a low sound, quiet and unnerving. It slowly\ngrew louder.\n“What’s so funny?” Olem asked.\nBo shook his head. “Nothing’s funny,” he said. “You don’t understand,\nTamas. You can’t kill a god.”\nTamas sat beside the body of his son. Taniel clung to life. The doctors said\nhe was in a coma. No telling when, or if, he’d ever come out.\nTamas should have insisted that Mihali come. He swallowed a lump in\nhis throat and hoped Taniel would survive the trip back to Adopest. Surely\na god could heal him. Once that was taken care of, he’d let Mihali tend to\nhis leg.\n“You’ve done well,” Tamas said, laying a hand on Taniel’s forehead. It\nwas hot to the touch. “Now, don’t die on me. I can’t lose you. I lost your\nmother. I will not lose you as well.”\nThe tent flap was pushed back. A large shadow was cast by the fiery\nmountain outside.\n“Your boy is a pit of a fighter.”\nTamas regarded his brother in law as the big man swept in and took the\n‑ ‑\nonly other seat in the room. “Do I call you Jakola or Gavril these days?”\nTamas asked. He passed a hand over his face, hoping the man did not see\nthe tears he wiped away.\n“Gavril will do,” the Watchmaster said.\nGavril. The name he’d taken to hide from Ipille’s hunters after his and\nTamas’s attempt to assassinate the Kez king. That had been a long time ago.\nA lifetime ago, it seemed. And Gavril had been a drunk since. He seemed\nsober enough now.\n“When we left South Pike, we could see the Kez army heading west,”\nGavril said. “Toward the Gates of Wasal.”"

No respite.”\n“They have a god on their side now, if what Bo says is true and\nKresimir is alive.”\n“So do we.”\n“What?”\n“Adom. Kresimir’s brother,” Tamas said. “Adom is not a violent god.\nHe is not Kresimir. The odds are in favor of the Kez when it comes to war.”\nGavril kicked his legs out, leaned back, and then hurriedly adjusted\nhimself when the chair beneath him began to creak. “A god,” he breathed.\n“Two gods! And ancient sorcerers. This is not the world we know, Tamas.”\n“I can think of nothing beyond this.” Tamas gestured to his son.\nGavril gave him a moment of silence before speaking. “I spent fifteen\nyears grieving my sister’s death,” he said. “If the worst happens, do not\nmake my mistake. I beg of you. And do not grieve him before he has\npassed.”\nTamas nodded. What else could he say?\n“I heard about Sabon,” Gavril said. “I’m sorry.”\n“There were traitors among my men,” Tamas said.\nGavril scowled.\n“The investigator I trusted to root out the traitor in my council.” Tamas\ntook a deep breath. “He succeeded, but turned out to be a traitor himself, his\nfamily held hostage. It got Sabon killed.”\n“What will you do with him?”\n“Make him answer for his crimes.”\n“Don’t let hate consume you,” Gavril warned.\n“Not hate,” Tamas said. “Justice.”\nGavril said, “Justice would have seen Kresimir burn all of Adro.”\nTamas pulled himself up and crossed to his traveling case, every step a\nworld of pain. He opened the top and drew out one of the matching Hrusch\npistols Taniel had brought him.\n“My son lies at death’s door,” Tamas said. He returned to his seat,\nlaying the pistol across his lap. “My wife is long dead, and many of my\nfriends have joined her.” He checked the barrel and drew back the hammer,\nthen aimed the weapon at the tent wall. “I have nothing left to inspire\ncompassion in me. I will meet Ipille’s forces at the Gates of Wasal. I will\nshove them back. I will route them into Kez and burn my way to Ipille’s\ndoor.” Tamas pulled the trigger, heard the hammer click. “I will confront\nKresimir and I will teach him about justice.”\nAcknowledgments\nThere are so many people without whom this book would not exist.\nI will start by thanking my amazing agent, Caitlin Blasdell, for seeing\npotential and then dragging me kicking and screaming through nitty-gritty\nedits before she’d even consider letting an editor see the book.

    "text": "wanted to cry out, “No… please… don’t make me change that character’s\nname!”\nThanks to my brilliant wife, Michele, and the hours we’ve spent tossing\naround ideas. So many of the cool things in this book came from her.\nI began to realize I wanted to write for a living in high school. Special\nappreciation goes to Marlene Napalo, who humored me and read my\nearliest stuff despite really expecting to hate it. She was key to kicking off\nthis whole journey. William Prueter taught me to love history, where even\nthe most fantastical imaginings get their roots. In college, countless people\nkept me going and gave me advice and encouragement. Foremost among\nthese were Zina Petersen and Grant “Boz” Boswell.\nThanks to Nancy Gould, who acted as my patron in a very transitional\ntime for me, despite having no evidence that I’d ever amount to anything.\nIsaac Stewart, Steve Diamond, and Logan Moritz read multiple\niterations of this book and others. I cannot express the dedication to\nfriendship this takes. Their feedback was invaluable. Thanks to Charisa\nPlayer, the very first stranger who read something of mine and thought I\nmight have a shot at getting published. Throughout my struggles to write\nand publish, there have been dozens who have read and given me feedback.\nThanks to all of them!\nThanks to Susan Barnes, Lauren Panepinto, and everyone else behind\nthe scenes at Orbit. It still flabbergasts me that others can get excited about\nworking on something that came from the depths of my imagination.\nMy utmost admiration and appreciation goes to Brandon Sanderson, for\nteaching me more about writing than anyone else and showing me how to\nnavigate an entire industry.\nOf course, these all pale in comparison to the gratitude I have for my\nmother, who made me take interest in things I seldom wanted, and never\ndoubted I’d be bona fide someday; and for my father, for paying for all the\nthings Mom made me do.\nFinally, thanks to all of my family for the encouragement they gave me\nto chase my dreams.\nAbout the Author\nBrian McClellan is an avid reader of fantasy and graduate of Orson Scott\nCard’s Literary Bookcamp.
