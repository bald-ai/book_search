But I still wonder if they have the wrong man. So many people depend on me. They say\nI will hold the future of the entire world on my arms.\nWhat would they think if they knew that their champion—the Hero of Ages, their savior—doubted himself? Perhaps they wouldn’t be shocked at all. In a way, this is\nwhat worries me most. Maybe, in their hearts, they wonder—just as I do.\nWhen they see me, do they see a liar?\nPROLOGUE\nA\nSH FELL FROM THE SKY.\nLord Tresting frowned, glancing up at the ruddy midday sky as his\nservants scuttled forward, opening a parasol over Tresting and his\ndistinguished guest. Ashfalls weren’t that uncommon in the Final Empire,\nbut Tresting had hoped to avoid getting soot stains on his fine new suit coat\nand red vest, which had just arrived via canal boat from Luthadel itself.\nFortunately, there wasn’t much wind; the parasol would likely be effective.\nTresting stood with his guest on a small hilltop patio that overlooked the\nfields. Hundreds of people in brown smocks worked in the falling ash,\ncaring for the crops. There was a sluggishness to their efforts—but, of\ncourse, that was the way of the skaa. The peasants were an indolent,\nunproductive lot. They didn’t complain, of course; they knew better than\nthat. Instead, they simply worked with bowed heads, moving about their\nwork with quiet apathy. The passing whip of a taskmaster would force them\ninto dedicated motion for a few moments, but as soon as the taskmaster\npassed, they would return to their languor.\nTresting turned to the man standing beside him on the hill. “One would\nthink,” Tresting noted, “that a thousand years of working in fields would\nhave bred them to be a little more effective at it.”\nThe obligator turned, raising an eyebrow—the motion done as if to\nhighlight his most distinctive feature, the intricate tattoos that laced the skin\naround his eyes. The tattoos were enormous, reaching all the way across his\nbrow and up the sides of his nose. This was a full prelan—a very important\nobligator indeed.

        "text": "obligator indeed. Tresting had his own, personal obligators back at the\nmanor, but they were only minor functionaries, with barely a few marks\naround their eyes. This man had arrived from Luthadel with the same canal\nboat that had brought Tresting’s new suit.\n“You should see city skaa, Tresting,” the obligator said, turning back to\nwatch the skaa workers. “These are actually quite diligent compared to\nthose inside Luthadel. You have more . . . direct control over your skaa\nhere. How many would you say you lose a month?”\n“Oh, a half dozen or so,” Tresting said. “Some to beatings, some to\nexhaustion.”\n“Runaways?”\n“Never!” Tresting said. “When I first inherited this land from my father, I\nhad a few runaways—but I executed their families. The rest quickly lost\nheart. I’ve never understood men who have trouble with their skaa—I find\nthe creatures easy to control, if you show a properly firm hand.”\nThe obligator nodded, standing quietly in his gray robes. He seemed\npleased—which was a good thing. The skaa weren’t actually Tresting’s\nproperty. Like all skaa, they belonged to the Lord Ruler; Tresting only\nleased the workers from his God, much in the same way he paid for the\nservices of His obligators.\nThe obligator looked down, checking his pocket watch, then glanced up\nat the sun. Despite the ashfall, the sun was bright this day, shining a brilliant\ncrimson red behind the smoky blackness of the upper sky. Tresting removed\na handkerchief and wiped his brow, thankful for the parasol’s shade against\nthe midday heat.\n“Very well, Tresting,” the obligator said. “I will carry your proposal to\nLord Venture, as requested. He will have a favorable report from me on\nyour operations here.”\nTresting held in a sigh of relief. An obligator was required to witness any\ncontract or business deal between noblemen. True, even a lowly obligator\nlike the ones Tresting employed could serve as such a witness—but it meant\nso much more to impress Straff Venture’s own obligator.\nThe obligator turned toward him. “I will leave back down the canal this\nafternoon.”\n“So soon?” Tresting asked. “Wouldn’t you care to stay for supper?”\n“No,” the obligator replied. “Though there is another matter I wish to\ndiscuss with you. I came not only at the behest of Lord Venture, but to . . .\nlook in on some matters for the Canton of Inquisition. Rumors say that you\nlike to dally with your skaa women.”\nTresting felt a chill.\nThe obligator smiled; he likely meant it to be disarming, but Tresting\nonly found it eerie. “Don’t worry yourself, Tresting,” the obligator said. “If\nthere had been any real worries about your actions, a Steel Inquisitor would\nhave been sent here in my place.”\nTresting nodded slowly.

He’d never seen one of the inhuman\ncreatures, but he had heard . . . stories.\n“I have been satisfied regarding your actions with the skaa women,” the\nobligator said, looking back over the fields. “What I’ve seen and heard here\nindicate that you always clean up your messes. A man such as yourself—\nefficient, productive—could go far in Luthadel. A few more years of work,\nsome inspired mercantile deals, and who knows?”\nThe obligator turned away, and Tresting found himself smiling. It wasn’t\na promise, or even an endorsement—for the most part, obligators were\nmore bureaucrats and witnesses than they were priests—but to hear such\npraise from one of the Lord Ruler’s own servants . . . Tresting knew that\nsome nobility considered the obligators to be unsettling—some men even\nconsidered them a bother—but at that moment, Testing could have kissed\nhis distinguished guest.\nTresting turned back toward the skaa, who worked quietly beneath the\nbloody sun and the lazy flakes of ash. Tresting had always been a country\nnobleman, living on his plantation, dreaming of perhaps moving into\nLuthadel itself. He had heard of the balls and the parties, the glamour and\nthe intrigue, and it excited him to no end.\nI’ll have to celebrate tonight, he thought. There was that young girl in the\nfourteenth hovel that he’d been watching for some time. . . .\nHe smiled again. A few more years of work, the obligator had said. But\ncould Tresting perhaps speed that up, if he worked a little harder? His skaa\npopulation had been growing lately. Perhaps if he pushed them a bit more,\nhe could bring in an extra harvest this summer and fulfill his contract with\nLord Venture in extra measure.\nTresting nodded as he watched the crowd of lazy skaa, some working\nwith their hoes, others on hands and knees, pushing the ash away from the\nfledgling crops. They didn’t complain. They didn’t hope. They barely dared\nthink. That was the way it should be, for they were skaa. They were—\nTresting froze as one of the skaa looked up. The man met Tresting’s eyes,\na spark—no, a fire—of defiance showing in his expression. Tresting had\nnever seen anything like it, not in the face of a skaa. Tresting stepped\nbackward reflexively, a chill running through him as the strange, straight-\nbacked skaa held his eyes.\nAnd smiled.\nTresting looked away. “Kurdon!” he snapped.\nThe burly taskmaster rushed up the incline. “Yes, my lord?”\nTresting turned, pointing at . . .\nHe frowned. Where had that skaa been standing? Working with their\nheads bowed, bodies stained by soot and sweat, they were so hard to tell\napart. Tresting paused, searching. He thought he knew the place . . . an\nempty spot, where nobody now stood.\nBut, no. That couldn’t be it. The man couldn’t have disappeared from the\ngroup so quickly. Where would he have gone? He must be in there,\nsomewhere, working with his head now properly bowed. Still, his moment\nof apparent defiance was inexcusable."

Still, his moment\nof apparent defiance was inexcusable.\n“My lord?” Kurdon asked again.\nThe obligator stood at the side, watching curiously. It would not be wise\nto let the man know that one of the skaa had acted so brazenly.\n“Work the skaa in that southern section a little harder,” Tresting ordered,\npointing. “I see them being sluggish, even for skaa. Beat a few of them.”\nKurdon shrugged, but nodded. It wasn’t much of a reason for a beating—\nbut, then, he didn’t need much of a reason to give the workers a beating.\nThey were, after all, only skaa.\nKelsier had heard stories.\nHe had heard whispers of times when once, long ago, the sun had not\nbeen red. Times when the sky hadn’t been clogged by smoke and ash, when\nplants hadn’t struggled to grow, and when skaa hadn’t been slaves. Times\nbefore the Lord Ruler. Those days, however, were nearly forgotten. Even\nthe legends were growing vague.\nKelsier watched the sun, his eyes following the giant red disk as it crept\ntoward the western horizon. He stood quietly for a long moment, alone in\nthe empty fields. The day’s work was done; the skaa had been herded back\nto their hovels. Soon the mists would come.\nEventually, Kelsier sighed, then turned to pick his way across the furrows\nand pathways, weaving between large heaps of ash. He avoided stepping on\nthe plants—though he wasn’t sure why he bothered. The crops hardly\nseemed worth the effort. Wan, with wilted brown leaves, the plants seemed\nas depressed as the people who tended them.\nThe skaa hovels loomed in the waning light. Already, Kelsier could see\nthe mists beginning to form, clouding the air, and giving the moundlike\nbuildings a surreal, intangible look. The hovels stood unguarded; there was\nno need for watchers, for no skaa would venture outside once night arrived.\nTheir fear of the mists was far too strong.\nI’ll have to cure them of that someday, Kelsier thought as he approached\none of the larger buildings. But, all things in their own time. He pulled open\nthe door and slipped inside.\nConversation stopped immediately. Kelsier closed the door, then turned\nwith a smile to confront the room of about thirty skaa. A firepit burned\nweakly at the center, and the large cauldron beside it was filled with\nvegetable-dappled water—the beginnings of an evening meal. The soup\nwould be bland, of course. Still, the smell was enticing.\n“Good evening, everyone,” Kelsier said with a smile, resting his pack\nbeside his feet and leaning against the door. “How was your day?”\nHis words broke the silence, and the women returned to their dinner\npreparations. A group of men sitting at a crude table, however, continued to\nregard Kelsier with dissatisfied expressions.\n“Our day was filled with work, traveler,” said Tepper, one of the skaa\nelders. “Something you managed to avoid.”"

        "text": "regard Kelsier with dissatisfied expressions.\n“Our day was filled with work, traveler,” said Tepper, one of the skaa\nelders. “Something you managed to avoid.”\n“Fieldwork hasn’t ever really suited me,” Kelsier said. “It’s far too hard\non my delicate skin.” He smiled, holding up hands and arms that were lined\nwith layers and layers of thin scars. They covered his skin, running\nlengthwise, as if some beast had repeatedly raked its claws up and down his\narms.\nTepper snorted. He was young to be an elder, probably barely into his\nforties—at most, he might be five years Kelsier’s senior. However, the\nscrawny man held himself with the air of one who liked to be in charge.\n“This is no time for levity,” Tepper said sternly. “When we harbor a\ntraveler, we expect him to behave himself and avoid suspicion. When you\nducked away from the fields this morning, you could have earned a\nwhipping for the men around you.”\n“True,” Kelsier said. “But those men could also have been whipped for\nstanding in the wrong place, for pausing too long, or for coughing when a\ntaskmaster walked by. I once saw a man beaten because his master claimed\nthat he had ‘blinked inappropriately.’ ”\nTepper sat with narrow eyes and a stiff posture, his arm resting on the\ntable. His expression was unyielding.\nKelsier sighed, rolling his eyes. “Fine. If you want me to go, I’ll be off\nthen.” He slung his pack up on his shoulder and nonchalantly pulled open\nthe door.\nThick mist immediately began to pour through the portal, drifting lazily\nacross Kelsier’s body, pooling on the floor and creeping across the dirt like\na hesitant animal. Several people gasped in horror, though most of them\nwere too stunned to make a sound. Kelsier stood for a moment, staring out\ninto the dark mists, their shifting currents lit feebly by the cooking pit’s\ncoals.\n“Close the door.” Tepper’s words were a plea, not a command.\nKelsier did as requested, pushing the door closed and stemming the flood\nof white mist. “The mist is not what you think. You fear it far too much.”\n“Men who venture into the mist lose their souls,” a woman whispered.\nHer words raised a question. Had Kelsier walked in the mists? What, then,\nhad happened to his soul?\nIf you only knew, Kelsier thought. “Well, I guess this means I’m staying.”\nHe waved for a boy to bring him a stool. “It’s a good thing, too—it would\nhave been a shame for me to leave before I shared my news.”\nMore than one person perked up at the comment. This was the real reason\nthey tolerated him—the reason even the timid peasants would harbor a man\nsuch as Kelsier, a skaa who defied the Lord Ruler’s will by traveling from\nplantation to plantation. A renegade he might be—a danger to the entire\ncommunity—but he brought news from the outside world.\n“I come from the north,” Kelsier said. “From lands where the Lord\nRuler’s touch is less noticeable.” He spoke in a clear voice, and people"

        "text": "community—but he brought news from the outside world.\n“I come from the north,” Kelsier said. “From lands where the Lord\nRuler’s touch is less noticeable.” He spoke in a clear voice, and people\nleaned unconsciously toward him as they worked. On the next day,\nKelsier’s words would be repeated to the several hundred people who lived\nin other hovels. The skaa might be subservient, but they were incurable\ngossips.\n“Local lords rule in the West,” Kelsier said, “and they are far from the\niron grip of the Lord Ruler and his obligators. Some of these distant\nnoblemen are finding that happy skaa make better workers than mistreated\nskaa. One man, Lord Renoux, has even ordered his taskmasters to stop\nunauthorized beatings. There are whispers that he’s considering paying\nwages to his plantation skaa, like city craftsmen might earn.”\n“Nonsense,” Tepper said.\n“My apologies,” Kelsier said. “I didn’t realize that Goodman Tepper had\nbeen to Lord Renoux’s estates recently. When you dined with him last, did\nhe tell you something that he did not tell me?”\nTepper blushed: Skaa did not travel, and they certainly didn’t dine with\nlords. “You think me a fool, traveler,” Tepper said, “but I know what you’re\ndoing. You’re the one they call the Survivor; those scars on your arms give\nyou away. You’re a troublemaker—you travel the plantations, stirring up\ndiscontent. You eat our food, telling your grand stories and your lies, then\nyou disappear and leave people like me to deal with the false hopes you\ngive our children.”\nKelsier raised an eyebrow. “Now, now, Goodman Tepper,” he said. “Your\nworries are completely unfounded. Why, I have no intention of eating your\nfood. I brought my own.” With that, Kelsier reached over and tossed his\npack onto the earth before Tepper’s table. The loose bag slumped to the\nside, dumping an array of foods to the ground. Fine breads, fruits, and even\na few thick, cured sausages bounced free.\nA summerfruit rolled across the packed earthen floor and bumped lightly\nagainst Tepper’s foot. The middle-aged skaa regarded the fruit with stunned\neyes. “That’s nobleman’s food!”\nKelsier snorted. “Barely. You know, for a man of renowned prestige and\nrank, your Lord Tresting has remarkably poor taste. His pantry is an\nembarrassment to his noble station.”\nTepper paled even further. “That’s where you went this afternoon,” he\nwhispered. “You went to the manor. You . . . stole from the master!”\n“Indeed,” Kelsier said. “And, might I add that while your lord’s taste in\nfood is deplorable, his eye for soldiers is far more impressive. Sneaking into\nhis manor during the day was quite a challenge.”\nTepper was still staring at the bag of food. “If the taskmasters find this\nhere . . .”\n“Well, I suggest you make it disappear then,” Kelsier said. “I’d be willing\nto bet that it tastes a fair bit better than watered-down farlet soup.”"

        "text": "here . . .”\n“Well, I suggest you make it disappear then,” Kelsier said. “I’d be willing\nto bet that it tastes a fair bit better than watered-down farlet soup.”\nTwo dozen sets of hungry eyes studied the food. If Tepper intended\nfurther arguments, he didn’t make them quickly enough, for his silent pause\nwas taken as agreement. Within a few minutes, the bag’s contents had been\ninspected and distributed, and the pot of soup sat bubbling and ignored as\nthe skaa feasted on a meal far more exotic.\nKelsier settled back, leaning against the hovel’s wooden wall and\nwatching the people devour their food. He had spoken correctly: The\npantry’s offerings had been depressingly mundane. However, this was a\npeople who had been fed on nothing but soup and gruel since they were\nchildren. To them, breads and fruits were rare delicacies—usually eaten\nonly as aging discards brought down by the house servants.\n“Your storytelling was cut short, young man,” an elderly skaa noted,\nhobbling over to sit on a stool beside Kelsier.\n“Oh, I suspect there will be time for more later,” Kelsier said. “Once all\nevidence of my thievery has been properly devoured. Don’t you want any\nof it?”\n“No need,” the old man said. “The last time I tried lords’ food, I had\nstomach pains for three days. New tastes are like new ideas, young man—\nthe older you get, the more difficult they are for you to stomach.”\nKelsier paused. The old man was hardly an imposing sight. His leathered\nskin and bald scalp made him look more frail than they did wise. Yet, he\nhad to be stronger than he looked; few plantation skaa lived to such ages.\nMany lords didn’t allow the elderly to remain home from daily work, and\nthe frequent beatings that made up a skaa’s life took a terrible toll on the\nelderly.\n“What was your name again?” Kelsier asked.\n“Mennis.”\nKelsier glanced back at Tepper. “So, Goodman Mennis, tell me\nsomething. Why do you let him lead?”\nMennis shrugged. “When you get to be my age, you have to be very\ncareful where you waste your energy. Some battles just aren’t worth\nfighting.” There was an implication in Mennis’s eyes; he was referring to\nthings greater than his own struggle with Tepper.\n“You’re satisfied with this, then?” Kelsier asked, nodding toward the\nhovel and its half-starved, overworked occupants. “You’re content with a\nlife full of beatings and endless drudgery?”\n“At least it’s a life,” Mennis said. “I know what wages malcontent and\nrebellion bring. The eye of the Lord Ruler, and the ire of the Steel Ministry,\ncan be far more terrible than a few whippings. Men like you preach change,\nbut I wonder. Is this a battle we can really fight?”\n“You’re fighting it already, Goodman Mennis. You’re just losing\nhorribly.” Kelsier shrugged. “But, what do I know? I’m just a traveling\nmiscreant, here to eat your food and impress your youths.”\nMennis shook his head. “You jest, but Tepper might have been right. I"

I\nfear your visit will bring us grief.”\nKelsier smiled. “That’s why I didn’t contradict him—at least, not on the\ntroublemaker point.” He paused, then smiled more deeply. “In fact, I’d say\ncalling me a troublemaker is probably the only accurate thing Tepper has\nsaid since I got here.”\n“How do you do that?” Mennis asked, frowning.\n“What?”\n“Smile so much.”\n“Oh, I’m just a happy person.”\nMennis glanced down at Kelsier’s hands. “You know, I’ve only seen\nscars like those on one other person—and he was dead. His body was\nreturned to Lord Tresting as proof that his punishment had been carried\nout.” Mennis looked up at Kelsier. “He’d been caught speaking of rebellion.\nTresting sent him to the Pits of Hathsin, where he had worked until he died.\nThe lad lasted less than a month.”\nKelsier glanced down at his hands and forearms. They still burned\nsometimes, though he was certain the pain was only in his mind. He looked\nup at Mennis and smiled. “You ask why I smile, Goodman Mennis? Well,\nthe Lord Ruler thinks he has claimed laughter and joy for himself. I’m\ndisinclined to let him do so. This is one battle that doesn’t take very much\neffort to fight.”\nMennis stared at Kelsier, and for a moment Kelsier thought the old man\nmight smile in return. However, Mennis eventually just shook his head. “I\ndon’t know. I just don’t—”\nThe scream cut him off. It came from outside, perhaps to the north,\nthough the mists distorted sounds. The people in the hovel fell silent,\nlistening to the faint, high-pitched yells. Despite the distance and the mist,\nKelsier could hear the pain contained in those screams.\nKelsier burned tin.\nIt was simple for him now, after years of practice. The tin sat with other\nAllomantic metals within his stomach, swallowed earlier, waiting for him to\ndraw upon them. He reached inside with his mind and touched the tin,\ntapping powers he still barely understood. The tin flared to life within him,\nburning his stomach like the sensation of a hot drink swallowed too quickly.\nAllomantic power surged through his body, enhancing his senses. The\nroom around him became crisp, the dull firepit flaring to near blinding\nbrightness. He could feel the grain in the wood of the stool beneath him. He\ncould still taste the remnants of the loaf of bread he’d snacked on earlier.\nMost importantly, he could hear the screams with supernatural ears. Two\nseparate people were yelling. One was an older woman, the other a younger\nwoman—perhaps a child. The younger screams were getting farther and\nfarther away.\n“Poor Jess,” a nearby woman said, her voice booming in Kelsier’s\nenhanced ears. “That child of hers was a curse. It’s better for skaa not to\nhave pretty daughters.”\nTepper nodded. “Lord Tresting was sure to send for the girl sooner or\nlater. We all knew it. Jess knew it.”"

Jess knew it.”\n“Still a shame, though,” another man said.\nThe screams continued in the distance. Burning tin, Kelsier was able to\njudge the direction accurately. Her voice was moving toward the lord’s\nmanor. The sounds set something off within him, and he felt his face flush\nwith anger.\nKelsier turned. “Does Lord Tresting ever return the girls after he’s\nfinished with them?”\nOld Mennis shook his head. “Lord Tresting is a law-abiding nobleman—\nhe has the girls killed after a few weeks. He doesn’t want to catch the eye of\nthe Inquisitors.”\nThat was the Lord Ruler’s command. He couldn’t afford to have half-\nbreed children running around—children who might possess powers that\nskaa weren’t even supposed to know existed. . . .\nThe screams waned, but Kelsier’s anger only built. The yells reminded\nhim of other screams. A woman’s screams from the past. He stood abruptly,\nstool toppling to the ground behind him.\n“Careful, lad,” Mennis said apprehensively. “Remember what I said\nabout wasting energy. You’ll never raise that rebellion of yours if you get\nyourself killed tonight.”\nKelsier glanced toward the old man. Then, through the screams and the\npain, he forced himself to smile. “I’m not here to lead a rebellion among\nyou, Goodman Mennis. I just want to stir up a little trouble.”\n“What good could that do?”\nKelsier’s smile deepened. “New days are coming. Survive a little longer,\nand you just might see great happenings in the Final Empire. I bid you all\nthanks for your hospitality.”\nWith that, he pulled open the door and strode out into the mist.\nMennis lay awake in the early hours of morning. It seemed that the older he\nbecame, the more difficult it was for him to sleep. This was particularly true\nwhen he was troubled about something, such as the traveler’s failure to\nreturn to the hovel.\nMennis hoped that Kelsier had come to his senses and decided to move\non. However, that prospect seemed unlikely; Mennis had seen the fire in\nKelsier’s eyes. It seemed such a shame that a man who had survived the\nPits would instead find death here, on a random plantation, trying to protect\na girl everyone else had given up for dead.\nHow would Lord Tresting react? He was said to be particularly harsh\nwith anyone who interrupted his nighttime enjoyments. If Kelsier had\nmanaged to disturb the master’s pleasures, Tresting might easily decide to\npunish the rest of his skaa by association.\nEventually, the other skaa began to awake. Mennis lay on the hard earth\n—bones aching, back complaining, muscles exhausted—trying to decide if\nit was worth rising. Each day, he nearly gave up. Each day, it was a little\nharder. One day, he would just stay in the hovel, waiting until the\ntaskmasters came to kill those who were too sick or too elderly to work.\nBut not today.

He could see too much fear in the eyes of the skaa—they\nknew that Kelsier’s nighttime activities would bring trouble. They needed\nMennis; they looked to him. He needed to get up.\nAnd so he did. Once he started moving, the pains of age decreased\nslightly, and he was able to shuffle out of the hovel toward the fields,\nleaning on a younger man for support.\nIt was then that he caught a scent in the air. “What’s that?” he asked. “Do\nyou smell smoke?”\nShum—the lad upon whom Mennis leaned—paused. The last remnants\nof the night’s mist had burned away, and the red sun was rising behind the\nsky’s usual haze of blackish clouds.\n“I always smell smoke, lately,” Shum said. “The Ashmounts are violent\nthis year.”\n“No,” Mennis said, feeling increasingly apprehensive. “This is different.”\nHe turned to the north, toward where a group of skaa were gathering. He let\ngo of Shum, shuffling toward the group, feet kicking up dust and ash as he\nmoved.\nAt the center of the group of people, he found Jess. Her daughter, the one\nthey all assumed had been taken by Lord Tresting, stood beside her. The\nyoung girl’s eyes were red from lack of sleep, but she appeared unharmed.\n“She came back not long after they took her,” the woman was explaining.\n“She came and pounded on the door, crying in the mist. Flen was sure it\nwas just a mistwraith impersonating her, but I had to let her in! I don’t care\nwhat he says, I’m not giving her up. I brought her out in the sunlight, and\nshe didn’t disappear. That proves she’s not a mistwraith!”\nMennis stumbled back from the growing crowd. Did none of them see it?\nNo taskmasters came to break up the group. No soldiers came to make the\nmorning population counts. Something was very wrong. Mennis continued\nto the north, moving frantically toward the manor house.\nBy the time he arrived, others had noticed the twisting line of smoke that\nwas just barely visible in the morning light. Mennis wasn’t the first to arrive\nat the edge of the short hilltop plateau, but the group made way for him\nwhen he did.\nThe manor house was gone. Only a blackened, smoldering scar remained.\n“By the Lord Ruler!” Mennis whispered. “What happened here?”\n“He killed them all.”\nMennis turned. The speaker was Jess’s girl. She stood looking down at\nthe fallen house, a satisfied expression on her youthful face.\n“They were dead when he brought me out,” she said. “All of them—the\nsoldiers, the taskmasters, the lords . . . dead. Even Lord Tresting and his\nobligators. The master had left me, going to investigate when the noises\nbegan. On the way out, I saw him lying in his own blood, stab wounds in\nhis chest. The man who saved me threw a torch in the building as we left.”\n“This man,” Mennis said. “He had scars on his hands and arms, reaching\npast the elbows?”\nThe girl nodded silently.\n“What kind of demon was that man?” one of the skaa muttered"

And, how did he\naccomplish a feat like this . . .? Lord Tresting kept over two dozen soldiers!\nDid Kelsier have a hidden band of rebels, perhaps?\nKelsier’s words from the night before sounded in his ears. New days are\ncoming. . . .\n“But, what of us?” Tepper asked, terrified. “What will happen when the\nLord Ruler hears this? He’ll think that we did it! He’ll send us to the Pits, or\nmaybe just send his koloss to slaughter us outright! Why would that\ntroublemaker do something like this? Doesn’t he understand the damage\nhe’s done?”\n“He understands,” Mennis said. “He warned us, Tepper. He came to stir\nup trouble.”\n“But, why?”\n“Because he knew we’d never rebel on our own, so he gave us no\nchoice.”\nTepper paled.\nLord Ruler, Mennis thought. I can’t do this. I can barely get up in the\nmornings—I can’t save this people.\nBut what other choice was there?\nMennis turned. “Gather the people, Tepper. We must flee before word of\nthis disaster reaches the Lord Ruler.”\n“Where will we go?”\n“The caves to the east,” Mennis said. “Travelers say there are rebel skaa\nhiding in them. Perhaps they’ll take us in.”\nTepper paled further. “But . . . we’d have to travel for days. Spend nights\nin the mist.”\n“We can do that,” Mennis said, “or we can stay here and die.”\nTepper stood frozen for a moment, and Mennis thought the shock of it all\nmight have overwhelmed him. Eventually, however, the younger man\nscurried off to gather the others, as commanded.\nMennis sighed, looking up toward the trailing line of smoke, cursing the\nman Kelsier quietly in his mind.\nNew days indeed.\nPART ONE\nTHE SURVIVOR\nOF HATHSIN\nI consider myself to be a man of principle. But, what man does not? Even the cutthroat, I have noticed, considers his actions “moral” after a fashion.\nPerhaps another person, reading of my life, would name me a religious tyrant. He could call me arrogant. What is to make that man’s opinion any less valid than my\nown?\nI guess it all comes down to one fact: In the end, I’m the one with the armies.\n1\nA\nSH FELL FROM THE SKY.\nVin watched the downy flakes drift through the air.

What\nwould that be like?\nVin sat quietly in one of the crew’s watch-holes—a hidden alcove built\ninto the bricks on the side of the safe house. From within it, a crewmember\ncould watch the street for signs of danger. Vin wasn’t on duty; the watch-\nhole was simply one of the few places where she could find solitude.\nAnd Vin liked solitude. When you’re alone, no one can betray you.\nReen’s words. Her brother had taught her so many things, then had\nreinforced them by doing what he’d always promised he would—by\nbetraying her himself. It’s the only way you’ll learn. Anyone will betray you,\nVin. Anyone.\nThe ash continued to fall. Sometimes, Vin imagined she was like the ash,\nor the wind, or the mist itself. A thing without thought, capable of simply\nbeing, not thinking, caring, or hurting. Then she could be . . . free.\nShe heard shuffling a short distance away, then the trapdoor at the back\nof the small chamber snapped open.\n“Vin!” Ulef said, sticking his head into the room. “There you are!\nCamon’s been searching for you for a half hour.”\nThat’s kind of why I hid in the first place.\n“You should get going,” Ulef said. “The job’s almost ready to begin.”\nUlef was a gangly boy. Nice, after his own fashion—naive, if one who\nhad grown up in the underworld could ever really be called “naive.” Of\ncourse, that didn’t mean he wouldn’t betray her. Betrayal had nothing to do\nwith friendship; it was a simple fact of survival. Life was harsh on the\nstreets, and if a skaa thief wanted to keep from being caught and executed,\nhe had to be practical.\nAnd ruthlessness was the very most practical of emotions. Another of\nReen’s sayings.\n“Well?” Ulef asked. “You should go. Camon’s mad.”\nWhen is he not? However, Vin nodded, scrambling out of the cramped—\nyet comforting—confines of the watch-hole. She brushed past Ulef and\nhopped out of the trapdoor, moving into a hallway, then a run-down pantry.\nThe room was one of many at the back of the store that served as a front for\nthe safe house. The crew’s lair itself was hidden in a tunneled stone cavern\nbeneath the building.\nShe left the building through a back door, Ulef trailing behind her. The\njob would happen a few blocks away, in a richer section of town. It was an\nintricate job—one of the most complex Vin had ever seen. Assuming\nCamon wasn’t caught, the payoff would be great indeed. If he was caught . .\n. Well, scamming noblemen and obligators was a very dangerous profession\n—but it certainly beat working in the forges or the textile mills.\nVin exited the alleyway, moving out onto a dark, tenement-lined street in\none of the city’s many skaa slums. Skaa too sick to work lay huddled in\ncorners and gutters, ash drifting around them. Vin kept her head down and\npulled up her cloak’s hood against the still falling flakes."

Reen made certain of that when he left.\n“There you are!” Camon lifted a squat, fat finger and jabbed it toward her\nface. “Where were you?”\nVin didn’t let hatred or rebellion show in her eyes. She simply looked\ndown, giving Camon what he expected to see. There were other ways to be\nstrong. That lesson she had learned on her own.\nCamon growled slightly, then raised his hand and backhanded her across\nthe face. The force of the blow threw Vin back against the wall, and her\ncheek blazed with pain. She slumped against the wood, but bore the\npunishment silently. Just another bruise. She was strong enough to deal with\nit. She’d done so before.\n“Listen,” Camon hissed. “This is an important job. It’s worth thousands\nof boxings—worth more than you a hundred times over. I won’t have you\nfouling it up. Understand?”\nVin nodded.\nCamon studied her for a moment, his pudgy face red with anger. Finally,\nhe looked away, muttering to himself.\nHe was annoyed about something—something more than just Vin.\nPerhaps he had heard about the skaa rebellion several days to the north. One\nof the provincial lords, Themos Tresting, had apparently been murdered, his\nmanor burned to the ground. Such disturbances were bad for business; they\nmade the aristocracy more alert, and less gullible. That, in turn, could cut\nseriously into Camon’s profits.\nHe’s looking for someone to punish, Vin thought. He always gets nervous\nbefore a job. She looked up at Camon, tasting blood on her lip. She must\nhave let some of her confidence show, because he glanced at her out of the\ncorner of his eye, and his expression darkened. He raised his hand, as if to\nstrike her again.\nVin used up a bit of her Luck.\nShe expended just a smidgen; she’d need the rest for the job. She directed\nthe Luck at Camon, calming his nervousness. The crewleader paused—\noblivious of Vin’s touch, yet feeling its effects nonetheless. He stood for a\nmoment; then he sighed, turning away and lowering his hand.\nVin wiped her lip as Camon waddled away. The thiefmaster looked very\nconvincing in his nobleman’s suit. It was as rich a costume as Vin had ever\nseen—it had a white shirt overlaid by a deep green vest with engraved gold\nbuttons. The black suit coat was long, after the current fashion, and he wore\na matching black hat. His fingers sparkled with rings, and he even carried a\nfine dueling cane. Indeed, Camon did an excellent job of imitating a\nnobleman; when it came to playing a role, there were few thieves more\ncompetent than Camon. Assuming he could keep his temper under control.\nThe room itself was less impressive. Vin pulled herself to her feet as\nCamon began to snap at some of the other crewmembers.

        "text": "Camon began to snap at some of the other crewmembers. They had rented\none of the suites at the top of a local hotel. Not too lavish—but that was the\nidea. Camon was going to be playing the part of “Lord Jedue,” a country\nnobleman who had hit upon hard financial times and come to Luthadel to\nget some final, desperate contracts.\nThe main room had been transformed into a sort of audience chamber, set\nwith a large desk for Camon to sit behind, the walls decorated with cheap\npieces of art. Two men stood beside the desk, dressed in formal stewards’\nclothing; they would play the part of Camon’s manservants.\n“What is this ruckus?” a man asked, entering the room. He was tall,\ndressed in a simple gray shirt and a pair of slacks, with a thin sword tied at\nhis waist. Theron was the other crewleader—this particular scam was\nactually his. He’d brought in Camon as a partner; he’d needed someone to\nplay Lord Jedue, and everyone knew that Camon was one of the best.\nCamon looked up. “Hum? Ruckus? Oh, that was just a minor discipline\nproblem. Don’t bother yourself, Theron.” Camon punctuated his remark\nwith a dismissive wave of the hand—there was a reason he played such a\ngood aristocrat. He was arrogant enough that he could have been from one\nof the Great Houses.\nTheron’s eyes narrowed. Vin knew what the man was probably thinking:\nHe was deciding how risky it would be to put a knife in Camon’s fat back\nonce the scam was over. Eventually, the taller crewleader looked away from\nCamon, glancing at Vin. “Who’s this?” he asked.\n“Just a member of my crew,” Camon said.\n“I thought we didn’t need anyone else.”\n“Well, we need her,” Camon said. “Ignore her. My end of the operation is\nnone of your concern.”\nTheron eyed Vin, obviously noting her bloodied lip. She glanced away.\nTheron’s eyes lingered on her, however, running down the length of her\nbody. She wore a simple white buttoned shirt and a pair of overalls. Indeed,\nshe was hardly enticing; scrawny with a youthful face, she supposedly\ndidn’t even look her sixteen years. Some men preferred such women,\nhowever.\nShe considered using a bit of Luck on him, but eventually he turned\naway. “The obligator is nearly here,” Theron said. “Are you ready?”\nCamon rolled his eyes, settling his bulk down into the chair behind the\ndesk. “Everything is perfect. Leave me be, Theron! Go back to your room\nand wait.”\nTheron frowned, then spun and walked from the room, muttering to\nhimself.\nVin scanned the room, studying the decor, the servants, the atmosphere.\nFinally, she made her way to Camon’s desk. The crewleader sat riffling\nthrough a stack of papers, apparently trying to decide which ones to put out\non the desktop.\n“Camon,” Vin said quietly, “the servants are too fine.”\nCamon frowned, looking up. “What is that you’re babbling?”\n“The servants,” Vin repeated, still speaking in a soft whisper. “Lord\nJedue is supposed to be desperate.

He’d have rich clothing left over from\nbefore, but he wouldn’t be able to afford such rich servants. He’d use skaa.”\nCamon glared at her, but he paused. Physically, there was little difference\nbetween noblemen and skaa. The servants Camon had appointed, however,\nwere dressed as minor noblemen—they were allowed to wear colorful\nvests, and they stood a little more confidently.\n“The obligator has to think that you’re nearly impoverished,” Vin said.\n“Pack the room with a lot of skaa servants instead.”\n“What do you know?” Camon said, scowling at her.\n“Enough.” She immediately regretted the word; it sounded too rebellious.\nCamon raised a bejeweled hand, and Vin braced herself for another slap.\nShe couldn’t afford to use up any more Luck. She had precious little\nremaining anyway.\nHowever, Camon didn’t hit her. Instead, he sighed and rested a pudgy\nhand on her shoulder. “Why do you insist on provoking me, Vin? You know\nthe debts your brother left when he ran away. Do you realize that a less\nmerciful man than myself would have sold you to the whoremasters long\nago? How would you like that, serving in some nobleman’s bed until he\ngrew tired of you and had you executed?”\nVin looked down at her feet.\nCamon’s grip grew tight, his fingers pinching her skin where neck met\nshoulder, and she gasped in pain despite herself. He grinned at the reaction.\n“Honestly, I don’t know why I keep you, Vin,” he said, increasing the\npressure of his grip. “I should have gotten rid of you months ago, when\nyour brother betrayed me. I suppose I just have too kindly a heart.”\nHe finally released her, then pointed for her to stand over by the side of\nthe room, next to a tall indoor plant. She did as ordered, orienting herself so\nshe had a good view of the entire room. As soon as Camon looked away,\nshe rubbed her shoulder. Just another pain. I can deal with pain.\nCamon sat for a few moments. Then, as expected, he waved to the two\n“servants” at his side.\n“You two!” he said. “You’re dressed too richly. Go put on something that\nmakes you look like skaa servants instead—and bring back six more men\nwith you when you come.”\nSoon, the room was filled as Vin had suggested. The obligator arrived a\nshort time later.\nVin watched Prelan Laird step haughtily into the room. Shaved bald like\nall obligators, he wore a set of dark gray robes. The Ministry tattoos around\nhis eyes identified him as a prelan, a senior bureaucrat in the Ministry’s\nCanton of Finance. A set of lesser obligators trailed behind him, their eye\ntattoos far less intricate.\nCamon rose as the prelan entered, a sign of respect—something even the\nhighest of Great House noblemen would show to an obligator of Laird’s\nrank. Laird gave no bow or acknowledgment of his own, instead striding\nforward and taking the seat in front of Camon’s desk.

One of the crewmen\nimpersonating a servant rushed forward, bringing chilled wine and fruit for\nthe obligator.\nLaird picked at the fruit, letting the servant stand obediently, holding the\nplatter of food as if he were a piece of furniture. “Lord Jedue,” Laird finally\nsaid. “I am glad we finally have the opportunity to meet.”\n“As am I, Your Grace,” Camon said.\n“Why is it, again, that you were unable to come to the Canton building,\ninstead requiring that I visit you here?”\n“My knees, Your Grace,” Camon said. “My physicians recommend that I\ntravel as little as possible.”\nAnd you were rightly apprehensive about being drawn into a Ministry\nstronghold, Vin thought.\n“I see,” Laird said. “Bad knees. An unfortunate attribute in a man who\ndeals in transportation.”\n“I don’t have to go on the trips, Your Grace,” Camon said, bowing his\nhead. “Just organize them.”\nGood, Vin thought. Make sure you remain subservient, Camon. You need\nto seem desperate.\nVin needed this scam to succeed. Camon threatened her and he beat her\n—but he considered her a good-luck charm. She wasn’t sure if he knew\nwhy his plans went better when she was in the room, but he had apparently\nmade the connection. That made her valuable—and Reen had always said\nthat the surest way to stay alive in the underworld was to make yourself\nindispensable.\n“I see,” Laird said again. “Well, I fear that our meeting has come too late\nfor your purposes. The Canton of Finance has already voted on your\nproposal.”\n“So soon?” Camon asked with genuine surprise.\n“Yes,” Laird replied, taking a sip of his wine, still not dismissing the\nservant. “We have decided not to accept your contract.”\nCamon sat for a moment, stunned. “I’m sorry to hear that, Your Grace.”\nLaird came to meet you, Vin thought. That means he’s still in a position\nto negotiate.\n“Indeed,” Camon continued, seeing what Vin had. “That is especially\nunfortunate, as I was ready to make the Ministry an even better offer.”\nLaird raised a tattooed eyebrow. “I doubt it will matter. There is an\nelement of the Council who feels that the Canton would receive better\nservice if we found a more stable house to transport our people.”\n“That would be a grave mistake,” Camon said smoothly. “Let us be\nfrank, Your Grace. We both know that this contract is House Jedue’s last\nchance. Now that we’ve lost the Farwan deal, we cannot afford to run our\ncanal boats to Luthadel anymore. Without the Ministry’s patronage, my\nhouse is financially doomed.”\n“This is doing very little to persuade me, Your Lordship,” the obligator\nsaid.\n“Isn’t it?” Camon asked. “Ask yourself this, Your Grace—who will serve\nyou better? Will it be the house that has dozens of contracts to divide its\nattention, or the house that views your contract as its last hope? The Canton\nof Finance will not find a more accommodating partner than a desperate\none. Let my boats be the ones that bring your acolytes down from the north\n—let my soldiers escort them—and you will not be disappointed.”"

Let my boats be the ones that bring your acolytes down from the north\n—let my soldiers escort them—and you will not be disappointed.”\nGood, Vin thought.\n“I . . . see,” the obligator said, now troubled.\n“I would be willing to give you an extended contract, locked in at the\nprice of fifty boxings a head per trip, Your Grace. Your acolytes would be\nable to travel our boats at their leisure, and would always have the escorts\nthey need.”\nThe obligator raised an eyebrow. “That’s half the former fee.”\n“I told you,” Camon said. “We’re desperate. My house needs to keep its\nboats running. Fifty boxings will not make us a profit, but that doesn’t\nmatter. Once we have the Ministry contract to bring us stability, we can find\nother contracts to fill our coffers.”\nLaird looked thoughtful. It was a fabulous deal—one that might\nordinarily have been suspicious. However, Camon’s presentation created\nthe image of a house on the brink of financial collapse. The other\ncrewleader, Theron, had spent five years building, scamming, and finagling\nto create this moment. The Ministry would be remiss not to consider the\nopportunity.\nLaird was realizing just that. The Steel Ministry was not just the force of\nbureaucracy and legal authority in the Final Empire—it was like a noble\nhouse unto itself. The more wealth it had, the better its own mercantile\ncontracts, the more leverage the various Ministry Cantons had with each\nother—and with the noble houses.\nLaird was still obviously hesitant, however. Vin could see the look in his\neyes, the suspicion she knew well. He was not going to take the contract.\nNow, Vin thought, It’s my turn.\nVin used her Luck on Laird. She reached out tentatively—not even really\nsure what she was doing, or why she could even do it. Yet her touch was\ninstinctive, trained through years of subtle practice. She’d been ten years\nold before she’d realized that other people couldn’t do what she could.\nShe pressed against Laird’s emotions, dampening them. He became less\nsuspicious, less afraid. Docile. His worries melted away, and Vin could see\na calm sense of control begin to assert itself in his eyes.\nYet, Laird still seemed slightly uncertain. Vin pushed harder. He cocked\nhis head, looking thoughtful. He opened his mouth to speak, but she pushed\nagainst him again, desperately using up her last pinch of Luck.\nHe paused again. “Very well,” he finally said. “I will take this new\nproposal to the Council. Perhaps an agreement can still be reached.”\nIf men read these words, let them know that power is a heavy burden. Seek not to be bound by its chains.

        "text": "N ELSIER’S OPINION, THE CITY\nsight. Most of the buildings had been built from stone blocks, with tile roofs\nfor the wealthy, and simple, peaked wooden roofs for the rest. The\nstructures were packed closely together, making them seem squat despite\nthe fact that they were generally three stories high.\nThe tenements and shops were uniform in appearance; this was not a\nplace to draw attention to oneself. Unless, of course, you were a member of\nthe high nobility.\nInterspersed throughout the city were a dozen or so monolithic keeps.\nIntricate, with rows of spearlike spires or deep archways, these were the\nhomes of the high nobility. In fact, they were the mark of a high noble\nfamily: Any family who could afford to build a keep and maintain a high-\nprofile presence in Luthadel was considered to be a Great House.\nMost of the open ground in the city was around these keeps. The patches\nof space amid the tenements were like clearings in a forest, the keeps\nthemselves like solitary mounts rising above the rest of the landscape.\nBlack mountains. Like the rest of the city, the keeps were stained by\ncountless years of ashfalls.\nEvery structure in Luthadel—virtually every structure Kelsier had ever\nseen—had been blackened to some degree. Even the city wall, upon which\nKelsier now stood, was blackened by a patina of soot. Structures were\ngenerally darkest at the top, where the ash gathered, but rainwaters and\nevening condensations had carried the stains over ledges and down walls.\nLike paint running down a canvas, the darkness seemed to creep down the\nsides of buildings in an uneven gradient.\nThe streets, of course, were completely black. Kelsier stood waiting,\nscanning the city as a group of skaa workers worked in the street below,\nclearing away the latest mounds of ash. They’d take it to the River\nChannerel, which ran through the center of the city, sending the piles of ash\nto be washed away, lest it pile up and eventually bury the city. Sometimes,\nKelsier wondered why the entire empire wasn’t just one big mound of ash.\nHe supposed the ash must break down into soil eventually. Yet, it took a\nridiculous amount of effort to keep cities and fields clear enough to be used.\nFortunately, there were always enough skaa to do the work. The workers\nbelow him wore simple coats and trousers, ash-stained and worn. Like the\nplantation workers he had left behind several weeks before, they worked\nwith beaten-down, despondent motions. Other groups of skaa passed the\nworkers, responding to the bells in the distance, chiming the hour and\ncalling them to their morning’s work at the forges or mills. Luthadel’s main\nexport was metal; the city was home to hundreds of forges and refineries.\nHowever, the surgings of the river provided excellent locations for mills,\nboth to grind grains and make textiles.\nThe skaa continued to work. Kelsier turned away from them, looking up\ninto the distance, toward the city center, where the Lord Ruler’s palace\nloomed like some kind of massive, multi-spined insect. Kredik Shaw, the\nHill of a Thousand Spires. The palace was several times the size of any"

The palace was several times the size of any\nnobleman’s keep, and was by far the largest building in the city.\nAnother ashfall began as Kelsier stood contemplating the city, the flakes\nfalling lightly down upon the streets and buildings. A lot of ashfalls, lately,\nhe thought, glad for the excuse to pull up the hood on his cloak. The\nAshmounts must be active.\nIt was unlikely that anyone in Luthadel would recognize him—it had\nbeen three years since his capture. Still, the hood was reassuring. If all went\nwell, there would come a time when Kelsier would want to be seen and\nrecognized. For now, anonymity was probably better.\nEventually, a figure approached along the wall. The man, Dockson, was\nshorter than Kelsier, and he had a squarish face that seemed well suited to\nhis moderately stocky build. A nondescript brown hooded cloak covered his\nblack hair, and he wore the same short half beard that he’d sported since his\nface had first put forth whiskers some twenty years before.\nHe, like Kelsier, wore a nobleman’s suit: colored vest, dark coat and\ntrousers, and a thin cloak to keep off the ash. The clothing wasn’t rich, but it\nwas aristocratic—indicative of the Luthadel middle class. Most men of\nnoble birth weren’t wealthy enough to be considered part of a Great House\n—yet, in the Final Empire, nobility wasn’t just about money. It was about\nlineage and history; the Lord Ruler was immortal, and he apparently still\nremembered the men who had supported him during the early years of his\nreign. The descendants of those men, no matter how poor they became,\nwould always be favored.\nThe clothing would keep passing guard patrols from asking too many\nquestions. In the cases of Kelsier and Dockson, of course, that clothing was\na lie. Neither was actually noble—though, technically, Kelsier was a half-\nblood. In many ways, however, that was worse than being just a normal\nskaa.\nDockson strolled up next to Kelsier, then leaned against the battlement,\nresting a pair of stout arms on the stone. “You’re a few days late, Kell.”\n“I decided to make a few extra stops in the plantations to the north.”\n“Ah,” Dockson said. “So you did have something to do with Lord\nTresting’s death.”\nKelsier smiled. “You could say that.”\n“His murder caused quite a stir among the local nobility.”\n“That was kind of the intention,” Kelsier said. “Though, to be honest, I\nwasn’t planning anything quite so dramatic. It was almost more of an\naccident than anything else.”\nDockson raised an eyebrow. “How do you ‘accidentally’ kill a nobleman\nin his own mansion?”\n“With a knife in the chest,” Kelsier said lightly. “Or, rather, a pair of\nknives in the chest—it always pays to be careful.”\nDockson rolled his eyes.\n“His death isn’t exactly a loss, Dox,” Kelsier said. “Even among the\nnobility, Tresting had a reputation for cruelty.”"

Attacking a\nprovincial lord in his manor house, surrounded by guards . . . Honestly,\nKell, I’d nearly forgotten how foolhardy you can be.”\n“Foolhardy?” Kelsier asked with a laugh. “That wasn’t foolhardy—that\nwas just a small diversion. You should see some of the things I’m planning\nto do!”\nDockson stood for a moment, then he laughed too. “By the Lord Ruler,\nit’s good to have you back, Kell! I’m afraid I’ve grown rather boring during\nthe last few years.”\n“We’ll fix that,” Kelsier promised. He took a deep breath, ash falling\nlightly around him. Skaa cleaning crews were already back at work on the\nstreets below, brushing up the dark ash. Behind, a guard patrol passed,\nnodding to Kelsier and Dockson. They waited in silence for the men to\npass.\n“It’s good to be back,” Kelsier finally said. “There’s something homey\nabout Luthadel—even if it is a depressing, stark pit of a city. You have the\nmeeting organized?”\nDockson nodded. “We can’t start until this evening, though. How’d you\nget in, anyway? I had men watching the gates.”\n“Hmm? Oh, I snuck in last night.”\n“But how—” Dockson paused. “Oh, right. That’s going to take some\ngetting used to.”\nKelsier shrugged. “I don’t see why. You always work with Mistings.”\n“Yes, but this is different,” Dockson said. He held up a hand to forestall\nfurther argument. “No need, Kell. I’m not hedging—I just said it would\ntake some getting used to.”\n“Fine. Who’s coming tonight?”\n“Well, Breeze and Ham will be there, of course. They’re very curious\nabout this mystery job of ours—not to mention rather annoyed that I won’t\ntell him what you’ve been up to these last few years.”\n“Good,” Kelsier said with a smile. “Let them wonder. How about Trap?”\nDockson shook his head. “Trap’s dead. The Ministry finally caught up\nwith him a couple months ago. Didn’t even bother sending him to the Pits—\nthey beheaded him on the spot.”\nKelsier closed his eyes, exhaling softly. It seemed that the Steel Ministry\ncaught up with everyone eventually. Sometimes, Kelsier felt that a skaa\nMisting’s life wasn’t so much about surviving as it was about picking the\nright time to die.\n“This leaves us without a Smoker,” Kelsier finally said, opening his eyes.\n“You have any suggestions?”\n“Ruddy,” Dockson said.\nKelsier shook his head. “No. He’s a good Smoker, but he’s not a good\nenough man.”\nDockson smiled. “Not a good enough man to be on a thieving crew . . .\nKell, I have missed working with you. All right, who then?”"

All right, who then?”\nKelsier thought for a moment. “Is Clubs still running that shop of his?”\n“As far as I know,” Dockson said slowly.\n“He’s supposed to be one of the best Smokers in the city.”\n“I suppose,” Dockson said. “But . . . isn’t he supposed to be kind of hard\nto work with?”\n“He’s not so bad,” Kelsier said. “Not once you get used to him. Besides, I\nthink he might be . . . amenable to this particular job.”\n“All right,” Dockson said, shrugging. “I’ll invite him. I think one of his\nrelatives is a Tineye. Do you want me to invite him too?”\n“Sounds good,” Kelsier said.\n“All right,” Dockson said. “Well, beyond that, there’s just Yeden.\nAssuming he’s still interested . . .”\n“He’ll be there,” Kelsier said.\n“He’d better be,” Dockson said. “He’ll be the one paying us, after all.”\nKelsier nodded, then frowned. “You didn’t mention Marsh.”\nDockson shrugged. “I warned you. Your brother never did approve of our\nmethods, and now . . . well, you know Marsh. He won’t even have anything\nto do with Yeden and the rebellion anymore, let alone with a bunch of\ncriminals like us. I think we’ll have to find someone else to infiltrate the\nobligators.”\n“No,” Kelsier said. “He’ll do it. I’ll just have to stop by to persuade him.”\n“If you say so.” Dockson fell silent then, and the two stood for a moment,\nleaning against the railing and looking out over the ash-stained city.\nDockson finally shook his head. “This is insane, eh?”\nKelsier smiled. “Feels good, doesn’t it?”\nDockson nodded. “Fantastic.”\n“It will be a job like no other,” Kelsier said, looking north—across the\ncity and toward the twisted building at its center.\nDockson stepped away from the wall. “We have a few hours before the\nmeeting. There’s something I want to show you. I think there’s still time—if\nwe hurry.”\nKelsier turned with curious eyes. “Well, I was going to go and chastise\nmy prude of a brother. But . . .”\n“This will be worth your time,” Dockson promised.\nVin sat in the corner of the safe house’s main lair. She kept to the shadows,\nas usual; the more she stayed out of sight, the more the others would ignore\nher. She couldn’t afford to expend Luck keeping the men’s hands off of her.\nShe’d barely had time to regenerate what she’d used a few days before,\nduring the meeting with the obligator.\nThe usual rabble lounged at tables in the room, playing at dice or\ndiscussing minor jobs. Smoke from a dozen different pipes pooled at the top\nof the chamber, and the walls were stained dark from countless years of\nsimilar treatment. The floor was darkened with patches of ash. Like most\nthieving crews, Camon’s group wasn’t known for its tidiness."

Like most\nthieving crews, Camon’s group wasn’t known for its tidiness.\nThere was a door at the back of the room, and beyond it lay a twisting\nstone stairway that led up to a false rain grate in an alleyway. This room,\nlike so many others hidden in the imperial capital of Luthadel, wasn’t\nsupposed to exist.\nRough laughter came from the front of the chamber, where Camon sat\nwith a half-dozen cronies enjoying a typical afternoon of ale and crass\njokes. Camon’s table sat beside the bar, where the overpriced drinks were\nsimply another way Camon exploited those who worked for him. The\nLuthadel criminal element had learned quite well from the lessons taught by\nthe nobility.\nVin tried her best to remain invisible. Six months before, she wouldn’t\nhave believed that her life could actually get worse without Reen. Yet,\ndespite her brother’s abusive anger, he had kept the other crewmembers\nfrom having their way with Vin. There were relatively few women on\nthieving crews; generally, those women who got involved with the\nunderworld ended up as whores. Reen had always told her that a girl needed\nto be tough—tougher, even, than a man—if she wanted to survive.\nYou think some crewleader is going to want a liability like you on his\nteam? he had said. I don’t even want to have to work with you, and I’m your\nbrother.\nHer back still throbbed; Camon had whipped her the day before. The\nblood would ruin her shirt, and she wouldn’t be able to afford another one.\nCamon was already retaining her wages to pay the debts Reen had left\nbehind.\nBut, I am strong, she thought.\nThat was the irony. The beatings almost didn’t hurt anymore, for Reen’s\nfrequent abuses had left Vin resilient, while at the same time teaching her\nhow to look pathetic and broken. In a way, the beatings were self-defeating.\nBruises and welts mended, but each new lashing left Vin more hardened.\nStronger.\nCamon stood up. He reached into his vest pocket and pulled out his\ngolden pocket watch. He nodded to one of his companions, then he scanned\nthe room, searching for . . . her.\nHis eyes locked on Vin. “It’s time.”\nVin frowned. Time for what?\nThe Ministry’s Canton of Finance was an imposing structure—but, then,\neverything about the Steel Ministry tended to be imposing.\nTall and blocky, the building had a massive rose window in the front,\nthough the glass was dark from the outside. Two large banners hung down\nbeside the window, the soot-stained red cloth proclaiming praises to the\nLord Ruler.\nCamon studied the building with a critical eye. Vin could sense his\napprehension. The Canton of Finance was hardly the most threatening of\nMinistry offices—the Canton of Inquisition, or even the Canton of\nOrthodoxy, had a far more ominous reputation. However, voluntarily\nentering any Ministry office . . . putting yourself in the power of the\nobligators . . . well, it was a thing to do only after serious consideration."

However, voluntarily\nentering any Ministry office . . . putting yourself in the power of the\nobligators . . . well, it was a thing to do only after serious consideration.\nCamon took a deep breath, then strode forward, his dueling cane tapping\nagainst the stones as he walked. He wore his rich nobleman’s suit, and he\nwas accompanied by a half-dozen crewmembers—including Vin—to act as\nhis “servants.”\nVin followed Camon up the steps, then waited as one of the\ncrewmembers jumped forward to pull the door open for his “master.” Of the\nsix attendants, only Vin seemed to have been told nothing of Camon’s plan.\nSuspiciously, Theron—Camon’s supposed partner in the Ministry scam—\nwas nowhere to be seen.\nVin entered the Canton building. Vibrant red light, sparkled with lines of\nblue, fell from the rose window. A single obligator, with midlevel tattoos\naround his eyes, sat behind a desk at the end of the extended entryway.\nCamon approached, his cane thumping against the carpet as he walked. “I\nam Lord Jedue,” he said.\nWhat are you doing, Camon? Vin thought. You insisted to Theron that\nyou wouldn’t meet with Prelan Laird in his Canton office. Yet, now you’re\nhere.\nThe obligator nodded, making a notation in his ledger. He waved to the\nside. “You may take one attendant with you into the waiting chamber. The\nrest must remain here.”\nCamon’s huff of disdain indicated what he thought of that prohibition.\nThe obligator, however, didn’t look up from his ledger. Camon stood for a\nmoment, and Vin couldn’t tell if he was genuinely angry or just playing the\npart of an arrogant nobleman. Finally, he jabbed a finger at Vin.\n“Come,” he said, turning and waddling toward the indicated door.\nThe room beyond was lavish and plush, and several noblemen lounged in\nvarious postures of waiting. Camon chose a chair and settled into it, then\npointed toward a table set with wine and red-frosted cakes. Vin obediently\nfetched him a glass of wine and a plate of food, ignoring her own hunger.\nCamon began to pick hungrily at the cakes, smacking quietly as he ate.\nHe’s nervous. More nervous, even, than before.\n“Once we get in, you will say nothing,” Camon grumbled between bites.\n“You’re betraying Theron,” Vin whispered.\nCamon nodded.\n“But, how? Why?” Theron’s plan was complex in execution, but simple\nin concept. Every year, the Ministry transferred its new acolyte obligators\nfrom a northern training facility south to Luthadel for final instruction.\nTheron had discovered, however, that those acolytes and their overseers\nbrought down with them large amounts of Ministry funds—disguised as\nbaggage—to be strongholded in Luthadel.\nBanditry was very difficult in the Final Empire, what with the constant\npatrols along canal routes. However, if one were running the very canal\nboats that the acolytes were sailing upon, a robbery could become possible.\nArranged at just the right time . . . the guards turning on their passengers . . ."

Setting up a scam like this would have\ncost Theron thousands upon thousands of boxings—if the deal fell through\nnow, he would be ruined. And, with the Ministry hunting him, he wouldn’t\neven have time to seek revenge. Camon would make a quick profit, as well\nas rid himself of one of his more powerful rivals.\nTheron was a fool to bring Camon into this, she thought. But, then, the\namount Theron had promised to pay Camon was great; he probably\nassumed that Camon’s greed would keep him honest until Theron himself\ncould pull a double cross. Camon had simply worked faster than anyone,\neven Vin, had expected. How could Theron have known that Camon would\nundermine the job itself, rather than wait and try and steal the entire haul\nfrom the caravan boats?\nVin’s stomach twisted. It’s just another betrayal, she thought sickly. Why\ndoes it still bother me so? Everyone betrays everyone else. That’s the way\nlife is. . . .\nShe wanted to find a corner—someplace cramped and secluded—and\nhide. Alone.\nAnyone will betray you. Anyone.\nBut there was no place to go. Eventually, a minor obligator entered and\ncalled for Lord Jedue. Vin followed Camon as they were ushered into an\naudience chamber.\nThe man who waited inside, sitting behind the audience desk, was not\nPrelan Laird.\nCamon paused in the doorway. The room was austere, bearing only the\ndesk and simple gray carpeting. The stone walls were unadorned, the only\nwindow barely a handspan wide. The obligator who waited for them had\nsome of the most intricate tattoos around his eyes that Vin had ever seen.\nShe wasn’t even certain what rank they implied, but they extended all the\nway back to the obligator’s ears and up over his forehead.\n“Lord Jedue,” the strange obligator said. Like Laird, he wore gray robes,\nbut he was very different from the stern, bureaucratic men Camon had dealt\nwith before. This man was lean in a muscular way, and his clean-shaven,\ntriangular head gave him an almost predatory look.\n“I was under the impression that I would be meeting with Prelan Laird,”\nCamon said, still not moving into the room.\n“Prelan Laird has been called away on other business. I am High Prelan\nArriev—head of the board that was reviewing your proposal. You have a\nrare opportunity to address me directly.

Now.\nCamon stood for a long moment, and Vin could see him considering. Run\nnow? Or, take a risk for the greater prize? Vin didn’t care about prizes; she\njust wanted to live. Camon, however, had not become crewleader without\nthe occasional gamble. He slowly moved into the room, eyes cautious as he\ntook the seat opposite the obligator.\n“Well, High Prelan Arriev,” Camon said with a careful voice. “I assume\nthat since I have been called back for another appointment, the board is\nconsidering my offer?”\n“Indeed we are,” the obligator said. “Though I must admit, there are\nsome Council members who are apprehensive about dealing with a family\nthat is so near to economic disaster. The Ministry generally prefers to be\nconservative in its financial operations.”\n“I see.”\n“But,” Arriev said, “there are others on the board who are quite eager to\ntake advantage of the savings you offered us.”\n“And with which group do you identify, Your Grace?”\n“I, as of yet, have not made my decision.” The obligator leaned forward.\n“Which is why I noted that you have a rare opportunity. Convince me, Lord\nJedue, and you will have your contract.”\n“Surely Prelan Laird outlined the details of our offer,” Camon said.\n“Yes, but I would like to hear the arguments from you personally. Humor\nme.”\nVin frowned. She remained near the back of the room, standing near the\ndoor, still half convinced she should run.\n“Well?” Arriev asked.\n“We need this contract, Your Grace,” Camon said. “Without it we won’t\nbe able to continue our canal shipping operations. Your contract would give\nus a much needed period of stability—a chance to maintain our caravan\nboats for a time while we search for other contracts.”\nArriev studied Camon for a moment. “Surely you can do better than that,\nLord Jedue. Laird said that you were very persuasive—let me hear you\nprove that you deserve our patronage.”\nVin prepared her Luck. She could make Arriev more inclined to believe .\n. . but something restrained her. The situation felt wrong.\n“We are your best choice, Your Grace,” Camon said. “You fear that my\nhouse will suffer economic failure? Well, if it does, what have you lost? At\nworst, my narrowboats would stop running, and you would have to find\nother merchants to deal with. Yet, if your patronage is enough to maintain\nmy house, then you have found yourself an enviable long-term contract.”\n“I see,” Arriev said lightly. “And why the Ministry? Why not make your\ndeal with someone else? Surely there are other options for your boats—\nother groups who would jump at such rates.”\nCamon frowned. “This isn’t about money, Your Grace, it is about the\nvictory—the showing of confidence—that we would gain by having a\nMinistry contract. If you trust us, others will too. I need your support.”\nCamon was sweating now. He was probably beginning to regret this"

He was probably beginning to regret this\ngamble. Had he been betrayed? Was Theron behind the odd meeting?\nThe obligator waited quietly. He could destroy them, Vin knew. If he\neven suspected that they were scamming him, he could give them over to\nthe Canton of Inquisition. More than one nobleman had entered a Canton\nbuilding and never returned.\nGritting her teeth, Vin reached out and used her Luck on the obligator,\nmaking him less suspicious.\nArriev smiled. “Well, you have convinced me,” he suddenly declared.\nCamon sighed in relief.\nArriev continued, “Your most recent letter suggested that you need three\nthousand boxings as an advance to refurbish your equipment and resume\nshipping operations. See the scribe in the main hallway to finish the\npaperwork so that you may requisition the necessary funds.”\nThe obligator pulled a sheet of thick bureaucratic paper from a stack,\nthen stamped a seal at the bottom. He proffered it to Camon. “Your\ncontract.”\nCamon smiled deeply. “I knew coming to the Ministry was the wise\nchoice,” he said, accepting the contract. He stood, nodding respectfully to\nthe obligator, then motioned for Vin to open the door for him.\nShe did so. Something is wrong. Something is very wrong. She paused as\nCamon left, looking back at the obligator. He was still smiling.\nA happy obligator was always a bad sign.\nYet, no one stopped them as they passed through the waiting room with\nits noble occupants. Camon sealed and delivered the contract to the\nappropriate scribe, and no soldiers appeared to arrest them. The scribe\npulled out a small chest filled with coins, and then handed it to Camon with\nan indifferent hand.\nThen, they simply left the Canton building, Camon gathering his other\nattendants with obvious relief. No cries of alarm. No tromping of soldiers.\nThey were free. Camon had successfully scammed both the Ministry and\nanother crew-leader.\nApparently.\nKelsier stuffed another one of the little red-frosted cakes into his mouth,\nchewing with satisfaction. The fat thief and his scrawny attendant passed\nthrough the waiting room, entering the entryway beyond. The obligator who\nhad interviewed the two thieves remained in his office, apparently awaiting\nhis next appointment\n“Well?” Dockson asked. “What do you think?”\nKelsier glanced at the cakes. “They’re quite good,” he said, taking\nanother one. “The Ministry has always had excellent taste—it makes sense\nthat they would provide superior snacks.”\nDockson rolled his eyes. “About the girl, Kell.”\nKelsier smiled as he piled four of the cakes in his hand, then nodded\ntoward the doorway. The Canton waiting room was growing too busy for\nthe discussion of delicate matters.

He paused beside an alleyway, standing where he\nand Dockson could watch the Canton building’s doors.\nKelsier munched contentedly on his cakes. “How’d you find out about\nher?” he asked between bites.\n“Your brother,” Dockson replied. “Camon tried to swindle Marsh a few\nmonths ago, and he brought the girl with him then, too. Actually, Camon’s\nlittle good-luck charm is becoming moderately famous in the right circles.\nI’m still not sure if he knows what she is or not. You know how\nsuperstitious thieves can get.”\nKelsier nodded, dusting off his hands. “How’d you know she’d be here\ntoday?”\nDockson shrugged. “A few bribes in the right place. I’ve been keeping an\neye on the girl ever since Marsh pointed her out to me. I wanted to give you\nan opportunity to see her work for yourself.”\nAcross the street, the Canton building’s door finally opened, and Camon\nmade his way down the steps surrounded by a group of “servants.” The\nsmall, short-haired girl was with him.

The right side of her face was still slightly\ndiscolored from a partially healed bruise.\nKelsier eyed the self-important Camon. I’ll have to come up with\nsomething particularly suitable to do to that man.\n“Poor thing,” Dockson muttered.\nKelsier nodded. “She’ll be free of him soon enough. It’s a wonder no one\ndiscovered her before this.”\n“Your brother was right then?”\nKelsier nodded. “She’s at least a Misting, and if Marsh says she’s more,\nI’m inclined to believe him. I’m a bit surprised to see her using Allomancy\non a member of the Ministry, especially inside a Canton building. I’d guess\nthat she doesn’t know that she’s even using her abilities.”\n“Is that possible?” Dockson asked.\nKelsier nodded. “Trace minerals in the water can be burned, if just for a\ntiny bit of power. That’s one of the reasons the Lord Ruler built his city here\n—lots of metals in the ground. I’d say that . . .”\nKelsier trailed off, frowning slightly. Something was wrong.

As he turned, Kelsier was\nable to see that a thick metal spike had been pounded tip-first through each\nof the man’s eyes.

The flat spike ends shone like two\nsilvery disks, sticking out of the sockets in the front, where the eyes should\nhave been.\nA Steel Inquisitor.\n“What’s that doing here?” Dockson asked.\n“Stay calm,” Kelsier said, trying to force himself to do the same. The\nInquisitor looked toward them, spiked eyes regarding Kelsier, before\nturning in the direction that Camon and the girl had gone. Like all\nInquisitors, he wore intricate eye tattoos—mostly black, with one stark red\nline—that marked him as a high-ranking member of the Canton of\nInquisition.\n“He’s not here for us,” Kelsier said. “I’m not burning anything—he’ll\nthink that we’re just ordinary noblemen.”\n“The girl,” Dockson said.\nKelsier nodded. “You say Camon’s been running this scam on the\nMinistry for a while.

Across the street, the Inquisitor conferred\nwith the other obligator, then the two of them turned to walk in the direction\nthat Camon had gone. There was no urgency to their pace.\n“They must have sent a tail to follow them,” Dockson said.\n“This is the Ministry,” Kelsier said. “There’ll be two tails, at least.”\nDockson nodded. “Camon will lead them directly back to his safe house.\nDozens of men will die. They’re not all the most admirable people, but . . .”\n“They fight the Final Empire, in their own way,” Kelsier said. “Besides,\nI’m not about to let a possible Mistborn slip away from us—I want to talk\nto that girl. Can you deal with those tails?”\n“I said I’d become boring, Kell,” Dockson said. “Not sloppy. I can\nhandle a couple of Ministry flunkies.”\n“Good,” Kelsier said, reaching into his cloak pocket and pulling out a\nsmall vial. A collection of metal flakes floated in an alcohol solution within.\nIron, steel, tin, pewter, copper, bronze, zinc, and brass—the eight basic\nAllomantic metals. Kelsier pulled off the stopper and downed the contents\nin a single swift gulp.\nHe pocketed the now empty vial, wiping his mouth. “I’ll handle that\nInquisitor.”\nDockson looked apprehensive. “You’re going to try and take him?”\nKelsier shook his head. “Too dangerous. I’ll just divert him. Now, get\ngoing—we don’t want those tails finding the safe house.”\nDockson nodded. “Meet back at the fifteenth crossroad,” he said before\ntaking off down the alley and disappearing around a corner.\nKelsier gave his friend a count of ten before reaching within himself and"

His body came awash with strength, clarity, and power.\nKelsier smiled; then—burning zinc—he reached out and yanked firmly\non the Inquisitor’s emotions. The creature froze in place, then spun, looking\nback toward the Canton building.\nLet’s have a chase now, you and I, Kelsier thought.\nWe arrived in Terris earlier this week, and, I have to say, I find the countryside beautiful. The great mountains to the north—with their bald snowcaps and forested mantles\n—stand like watchful gods over this land of green fertility. My own lands to the south are mostly flat; I think that they might look less dreary if there were a few mountains\nto vary the terrain.\nThe people here are mostly herdsmen—though timber harvesters and farmers are not uncommon. It is a pastoral land, certainly. It seems odd that a place so\nremarkably agrarian could have produced the prophecies and theologies upon which the entire world now relies.\n3\nC golden boxings one by one into the small chest on\nAMON COUNTED HIS COINS, DROPPING THE\nhis table. He still looked a bit stunned, as well he should have. Three\nthousand boxings was a fabulous amount of money—far more than Camon\nwould earn in even a very good year. His closest cronies sat at the table\nwith him, ale—and laughter—flowing freely.\nVin sat in her corner, trying to understand her feelings of dread. Three\nthousand boxings. The Ministry should never have let such a sum go so\nquickly. Prelan Arriev had seemed too cunning to be fooled with ease.\nCamon dropped another coin into the chest. Vin couldn’t decide if he was\nbeing foolish or clever by making such a display of wealth. Underworld\ncrews worked under a strict agreement: Everyone received a cut of earnings\nin proportion to their status in the group. While it was sometimes tempting\nto kill the crewleader and take his money for yourself, a successful leader\ncreated more wealth for everyone. Kill him prematurely, and you would cut\noff future earnings—not to mention earn the wrath of the other\ncrewmembers.\nStill, three thousand boxings . . . that would be enough to tempt even the\nmost logical thief. It was all wrong.\nI have to get out of here, Vin decided. Get away from Camon, and the\nlair, in case something happens.\nAnd yet . . . leave? By herself? She’d never been alone before; she’d\nalways had Reen. He’d been the one to lead her from city to city, joining\ndifferent thieving crews. She loved solitude. But the thought of being by\nherself, out in the city, horrified her. That was why she’d never run away\nfrom Reen; that was why she’d stayed with Camon.\nShe couldn’t go. But she had to. She looked up from her corner, scanning\nthe room. There weren’t many people in the crew for whom she felt any\nsort of attachment. Yet, there were a couple that she would be sorry to see\nhurt, should the obligators actually move against the crew. A few men who"

A few men who\nhadn’t tried to abuse her, or—in very rare cases—who had actually shown\nher some measure of kindness.\nUlef was at the top of that list. He wasn’t a friend, but he was the closest\nthing she had now that Reen was gone. If he would go with her, then at least\nshe wouldn’t be alone. Cautiously, Vin stood and moved along the side of\nthe room to where Ulef sat drinking with some of the other younger\ncrewmembers.\nShe tugged on Ulef’s sleeve. He turned toward her, only slightly drunk.\n“Vin?”\n“Ulef,” she whispered. “We need to go.”\nHe frowned. “Go? Go where?”\n“Away,” Vin whispered. “Out of here.”\n“Now?”\nVin nodded urgently.\nUlef glanced back at his friends, who were chuckling among themselves,\nshooting suggestive looks at Vin and Ulef.\nUlef flushed. “You want to go somewhere, just you and I?”\n“Not like that,” Vin said. “Just . . . I need to leave the lair. And I don’t\nwant to be alone.”\nUlef frowned. He leaned closer, a slight stink of ale on his breath. “What\nis this about, Vin?” he asked quietly.\nVin paused. “I . . . think something might happen, Ulef,” she whispered.\n“Something with the obligators. I just don’t want to be in the lair right\nnow.”\nUlef sat quietly for a moment. “All right,” he finally said. “How long will\nthis take?”\n“I don’t know,” Vin said. “Until evening, at least. But we have to go.\nNow.”\nHe nodded slowly.\n“Wait here for a moment,” Vin whispered, turning. She shot a glance at\nCamon, who was laughing at one of his own jokes. Then she quietly moved\nthrough the ash-stained, smoky chamber into the lair’s back room.\nThe crew’s general sleeping quarters consisted of a simple, elongated\ncorridor lined with bedrolls. It was crowded and uncomfortable, but it was\nfar better than the cold alleyways she’d slept in during her years traveling\nwith Reen.\nAlleyways that I might have to get used to again, she thought. She had\nsurvived them before. She could do so again.\nShe moved to her pallet, the muffled sounds of men laughing and\ndrinking sounding from the other room. Vin knelt down, regarding her few\npossessions. If something did happen to the crew, she wouldn’t be able to\ncome back to the lair. Ever. But, she couldn’t take the bedroll with her now\n—it was far too obvious. That left only the small box that contained her\npersonal effects: a pebble from each city she’d visited, the earring Reen said\nVin’s mother had given her, and a bit of obsidian the size of a large coin. It\nwas chipped into an irregular pattern—Reen had carried it as some kind of\ngood luck charm. It was the only thing he’d left behind when he’d snuck\naway from the crew half a year before. Abandoning her."

        "text": "good luck charm. It was the only thing he’d left behind when he’d snuck\naway from the crew half a year before. Abandoning her.\nJust like he always said he would, Vin told herself sternly. I never\nthought he’d actually go—and that’s exactly why he had to leave.\nShe gripped the bit of obsidian in her hand and pocketed the pebbles. The\nearring she put in her ear—it was a very simple thing. Little more than a\nstud, not even worth stealing, which was why she didn’t fear leaving it in\nthe back room. Still, Vin had rarely worn it, for fear that the ornamentation\nwould make her look more feminine.\nShe had no money, but Reen had taught her how to scavenge and beg.\nBoth were difficult in the Final Empire, especially in Luthadel, but she\nwould find a way, if she had to.\nVin left her box and bedroll, slipping back out into the common room.\nMaybe she was overreacting; perhaps nothing would happen to the crew.\nBut, if it did . . . well, if there was one thing Reen had taught her, it was\nhow to protect her neck. Bringing Ulef was a good idea. He had contacts in\nLuthadel. If something happened to Camon’s crew, Ulef could probably get\nher and him jobs on—\nVin froze just inside the main room. Ulef wasn’t at the table where she\nhad left him. Instead, he stood furtively near the front of the room. Near the\nbar. Near . . . Camon.\n“What is this!” Camon stood, his face red as sunlight. He pushed his\nstool out of the way, then lurched toward her, half drunk. “Running away?\nOff to betray me to the Ministry, are you!”\nVin dashed toward the stairwell door, desperately scrambling around\ntables and past crewmembers.\nCamon’s hurled wooden stool hit her square in the back, throwing her to\nthe ground. Pain flared between her shoulders; several crewmembers cried\nout as the stool bounced off of her and thumped against the floorboards\nnearby.\nVin lay in a daze. Then . . . something within her—something she knew\nof but didn’t understand—gave her strength. Her head stopped swimming,\nher pain becoming a focus. She climbed awkwardly to her feet.\nCamon was there. He backhanded her even as she stood. Her head\nsnapped to the side from the blow, twisting her neck so painfully that she\nbarely felt herself hit the floor again.\nCamon bent over, grabbing her by the front of her shirt and pulling her\nup, raising his fist. Vin didn’t pause to think or to speak; there was only one\nthing to do. She used up all of her Luck in a single furious effort, pushing\nagainst Camon, calming his fury.\nCamon teetered. For a moment, his eyes softened. He lowered her\nslightly.\nThen the anger returned to his eyes. Hard. Terrifying.\n“Damn wench,” Camon muttered, grabbing her by the shoulders and\nshaking her. “That backstabbing brother of yours never respected me, and\nyou’re the same. I was too easy on you both. Should have . . .”\nVin tried to twist free, but Camon’s grip was firm. She searched"

        "text": "you’re the same. I was too easy on you both. Should have . . .”\nVin tried to twist free, but Camon’s grip was firm. She searched\ndesperately for aid from the other crewmembers—however, she knew what\nshe would find. Indifference. They turned away, their faces embarrassed but\nnot concerned. Ulef still stood near Camon’s table, looking down guiltily.\nIn her mind, she thought she heard a voice whispering to her. Reen’s\nvoice. Fool! Ruthlessness—it’s the most logical of emotions. You don’t have\nany friends in the underworld. You’ll never have any friends in the\nunderworld!\nShe renewed her struggles, but Camon hit her again, knocking her to the\nground. The blow stunned her, and she gasped, breath knocked from her\nlungs.\nJust endure, she thought, mind muddled. He won’t kill me. He needs me.\nYet, as she turned weakly, she saw Camon looming above her in the\ncaliginous room, drunken fury showing in his face. She knew this time\nwould be different; it would be no simple beating. He thought that she\nintended to betray him to the Ministry. He wasn’t in control.\nThere was murder in his eyes.\nPlease! Vin thought with desperation, reaching for her Luck, trying to\nmake it work. There was no response. Luck, such as it was, had failed her.\nCamon bent down, muttering to himself as he grabbed her by the\nshoulder. He raised an arm—his meaty hand forming another fist, his\nmuscles tensing, an angry bead of sweat slipping off his chin and hitting her\non the cheek.\nA few feet away, the stairwell door shook, then burst open. Camon\npaused, arm upraised as he glared toward the door and whatever\nunfortunate crewmember had chosen such an inopportune moment to return\nto the lair.\nVin seized the distraction. Ignoring the newcomer, she tried to shake\nherself free from Camon’s grip, but she was too weak. Her face blazed from\nwhere he’d hit her, and she tasted blood on her lip. Her shoulder had been\ntwisted awkwardly, and her side ached from where she’d fallen. She clawed\nat Camon’s hand, but she suddenly felt weak, her inner strength failing her\njust as her Luck had. Her pains suddenly seemed greater, more daunting,\nmore . . . demanding.\nShe turned toward the door desperately. She was close—painfully close.\nShe had nearly escaped. Just a little farther . . .\nThen she saw the man standing quietly in the stairwell doorway. He was\nunfamiliar to her. Tall and hawk-faced, he had light blond hair and wore a\nrelaxed nobleman’s suit, his cloak hanging free. He was, perhaps, in his\nmid-thirties. He wore no hat, nor did he carry a dueling cane.\nAnd he looked very, very angry.\n“What is this?” Camon demanded. “Who are you?”\nHow did he get by the scouts . . .? Vin thought, struggling to get her wits\nback. Pain. She could deal with pain. The obligators . . . did they send him?\nThe newcomer looked down at Vin, and his expression softened slightly.\nThen he looked up at Camon and his eyes grew dark."

The obligators . . . did they send him?\nThe newcomer looked down at Vin, and his expression softened slightly.\nThen he looked up at Camon and his eyes grew dark.\nCamon’s angry demands were cut off as he was thrown backward as if\nhad been punched by a powerful force. His arm was ripped free from Vin’s\nshoulder, and he toppled to the ground, causing the floorboards to shake.\nThe room fell quiet.\nHave to get away, Vin thought, forcing herself up to her knees. Camon\ngroaned in pain from a few feet away, and Vin crawled away from him,\nslipping beneath an unoccupied table. The lair had a hidden exit, a trapdoor\nbeside the far back wall. If she could crawl to it—\nSuddenly, Vin felt an overwhelming peace. The emotion slammed into\nher like a sudden weight, her emotions squished silent, as if crushed by a\nforceful hand. Her fear puffed out like an extinguished candle, and even her\npain seemed unimportant.\nShe slowed, wondering why she had been so worried. She stood up,\npausing as she faced the trapdoor. She breathed heavily, still a little dazed.\nCamon just tried to kill me! the logical part of her mind warned. And\nsomeone else is attacking the lair. I have to get away! However, her\nemotions didn’t match the logic. She felt . . . serene. Unworried. And more\nthan a little bit curious.\nSomeone had just used Luck on her.\nShe recognized it somehow, even though she’d never felt it upon her\nbefore. She paused beside the table, one hand on the wood, then slowly\nturned around. The newcomer still stood in the stairwell doorway. He\nstudied her with a critical eye, then smiled in a disarming sort of way.\nWhat is going on?\nThe newcomer finally stepped into the room. The rest of Camon’s crew\nremained sitting at their tables. They looked surprised, but oddly unworried.\nHe’s using Luck on them all. But . . . how can he do it to so many at\nonce? Vin had never been able to store up enough Luck to do more than\ngive the occasional, brief push.\nAs the newcomer entered the room, Vin could finally see that a second\nperson stood in the stairwell behind him. This second man was less\nimposing. He was shorter, with a dark half beard and close-cropped straight\nhair. He also wore a nobleman’s suit, though his was less sharply tailored.\nOn the other side of the room, Camon groaned and sat up, holding his\nhead. He glanced at the newcomers. “Master Dockson! Why, uh, well, this\nis a surprise!”\n“Indeed,” said the shorter man—Dockson. Vin frowned, realizing she\nsensed a slight familiarity to these men. She recognized them from\nsomewhere.\nThe Canton of Finance. They were sitting in the waiting room when\nCamon and I left.\nCamon climbed to his feet, studying the blond newcomer. Camon looked\ndown at the man’s hands, both of which were lined with strange,\noverlapping scars. “By the Lord Ruler . . .” Camon whispered. “The\nSurvivor of Hathsin!”\nVin frowned. The title was unfamiliar to her. Should she know this man?"

Should she know this man?\nHer wounds still throbbed despite the peace she felt, and her head was\ndizzy. She leaned on the table for support, but did not sit.\nWhoever this newcomer was, Camon obviously thought him important.\n“Why, Master Kelsier!” Camon sputtered. “This is a rare honor!”\nThe newcomer—Kelsier—shook his head. “You know, I’m not really\ninterested in listening to you.”\nCamon let out an “urk” of pain as he was thrown backward again. Kelsier\nmade no obvious gesture to perform the feat. Yet, Camon collapsed to the\nground, as if shoved by some unseen force.\nCamon fell quiet, and Kelsier scanned the room. “The rest of you know\nwho I am?”\nMany of the crewmembers nodded.\n“Good. I’ve come to your lair because you, my friends, owe me a great\ndebt.”\nThe room was silent save for Camon’s groans. Finally, one of the\ncrewmen spoke. “We . . . do, Master Kelsier?”\n“Indeed you do. You see, Master Dockson and I just saved your lives.\nYour rather incompetent crewleader left the Ministry’s Canton of Finance\nabout an hour ago, returning directly to this safe house. He was followed by\ntwo Ministry scouts, one high-ranking prelan . . . and a single Steel\nInquisitor.”\nNo one spoke.\nOh, Lord . . . Vin thought. She’d been right—she just hadn’t been fast\nenough. If there was an Inquisitor—\n“I dealt with the Inquisitor,” Kelsier said. He paused, letting the\nimplication hang in the air. What kind of person could so lightly claim to\nhave “dealt” with an Inquisitor? Rumors said the creatures were immortal,\nthat they could see a man’s soul, and that they were unmatched warriors.\n“I require payment for services rendered,” Kelsier said.\nCamon didn’t get up this time; he had fallen hard, and he was obviously\ndisoriented. The room remained still. Finally, Milev—the dark-skinned man\nwho was Camon’s second—scooped up the coffer of Ministry boxings and\ndashed forward with it. He proffered it to Kelsier.\n“The money Camon got from the Ministry,” Milev explained. “Three\nthousand boxings.”\nMilev is so eager to please him, Vin thought. This is more than just Luck\n—either that, or it’s some sort of Luck I’ve never been able to use.\nKelsier paused, then accepted the coin chest. “And you are?”\n“Milev, Master Kelsier.”\n“Well, Crewleader Milev, I will consider this payment satisfactory—\nassuming you do one other thing for me.”\nMilev paused. “What would that be?”\nKelsier nodded toward the near-unconscious Camon. “Deal with him.”\n“Of course,” Milev said.\n“I want him to live, Milev,” Kelsier said, holding up a finger. “But I don’t\nwant him to enjoy it.”"

Then he opened the coin chest and began counting\nout some golden boxings. “You’re a resourceful man, Milev. Quick on your\nfeet, and not as easily intimidated as the others.”\n“I’ve had dealings with Mistings before, Master Kelsier,” Milev said.\nKelsier nodded. “Dox,” he said, addressing his companion, “where were\nwe going to have our meeting tonight?”\n“I was thinking that we should use Clubs’s shop,” said the second man.\n“Hardly a neutral location,” Kelsier said. “Especially if he decides not to\njoin us.”\n“True.”\nKelsier looked to Milev. “I’m planning a job in this area. It would be\nuseful to have the support of some locals.” He held out a pile of what\nlooked like a hundred boxings. “We’ll require use of your safe house for the\nevening. This can be arranged?”\n“Of course,” Milev said, taking the coins eagerly.\n“Good,” Kelsier said. “Now, get out.”\n“Out?” Milev asked hesitantly.\n“Yes,” Kelsier said. “Take your men—including your former leader—and\nleave. I want to have a private conversation with Mistress Vin.”\nThe room grew silent again, and Vin knew she wasn’t the only one\nwondering how Kelsier knew her name.\n“Well, you heard him!” Milev snapped. He waved for a group of thugs to\ngo grab Camon, then he shooed the rest of the crewmembers up the stairs.\nVin watched them go, growing apprehensive. This Kelsier was a powerful\nman, and instinct told her that powerful men were dangerous. Did he know\nof her Luck? Obviously; what other reason would he have for singling her\nout?\nHow is this Kelsier going to try and use me? she thought, rubbing her\narm where she’d hit the floor.\n“By the way, Milev,” Kelsier said idly. “When I say ‘private,’ I mean that\nI don’t want to be spied on by the four men watching us through peek-holes\nbehind the far wall. Kindly take them up into the alley with you.”\nMilev paled. “Of course, Master Kelsier.”\n“Good. And, in the alleyway you’ll find the two dead Ministry spies.\nKindly dispose of the corpses for us.”\nMilev nodded, turning.\n“And Milev,” Kelsier added.\nMilev turned back again.\n“See that none of your men betray us,” Kelsier said quietly.

She was alone with a man who was—for some\nreason—so singularly impressive that he could intimidate an entire room\nfull of cutthroats and thieves.\nShe eyed the bolt door. Kelsier was watching her. What would he do if\nshe ran?\nHe claims to have killed an Inquisitor, Vin thought. And . . . he used\nLuck. I have to stay, if just long enough to find out what he knows.\nKelsier’s smile deepened, then finally he laughed. “That was far too\nmuch fun, Dox.”\nThe other man, the one Camon had called Dockson, snorted and walked\ntoward the front of the room. Vin tensed, but he didn’t move toward her,\ninstead strolled to the bar.\n“You were insufferable enough before, Kell,” Dockson said. “I don’t\nknow how I’m going to handle this new reputation of yours. At least, I’m\nnot sure how I’m going to handle it and maintain a straight face.”\n“You’re jealous.”\n“Yes, that’s it,” Dockson said. “I’m terribly jealous of your ability to\nintimidate petty criminals. If it’s of any note to you, I think you were too\nharsh on Camon.”\nKelsier walked over and took a seat at one of the room’s tables. His mirth\ndarkened slightly as he spoke. “You saw what he was doing to the girl.”\n“Actually, I didn’t,” Dockson said dryly, rummaging through the bar’s\nstores. “Someone was blocking the doorway.”\nKelsier shrugged. “Look at her, Dox. The poor thing’s been beaten nearly\nsenseless. I don’t feel any sympathy for the man.”\nVin remained where she was, keeping watch on both men. As the tension\nof the moment grew weaker, her wounds began to throb again. The blow\nbetween her shoulder blades—that would be a large bruise—and the slap to\nher face burned as well. She was still a little dizzy.\nKelsier was watching her. Vin clinched her teeth. Pain. She could deal\nwith pain.\n“You need anything, child?” Dockson asked. “A wet handkerchief for\nthat face, perhaps?”\nShe didn’t respond, instead remaining focused on Kelsier. Come on. Tell\nme what you want with me. Make your play.\nDockson finally shrugged, then ducked beneath the bar for a moment. He\neventually came up with a couple of bottles.\n“Anything good?” Kelsier asked, turning.\n“What do you think?” Dockson asked. “Even among thieves, Camon\nisn’t exactly known for his refinement. I have socks worth more than this\nwine.”\nKelsier sighed. “Give me a cup anyway.” Then he glanced back at Vin.\n“You want anything?”\nVin didn’t respond.\nKelsier smiled. “Don’t worry—we’re far less frightening than your\nfriends think.”\n“I don’t think they were her friends, Kell,” Dockson said from behind the\nbar."

Other than Dox’s breath.”\nDockson rolled his eyes. “Or Kell’s jokes.”\nVin stood quietly. She could act weak, the way she had with Camon, but\ninstincts told her that these men wouldn’t respond well to that tactic. So, she\nremained where she was, assessing the situation.\nThe calmness fell upon her again. It encouraged her to be at ease, to be\ntrusting, to simply do as the men were suggesting. . . .\nNo! She stayed where she was.\nKelsier raised an eyebrow. “That’s unexpected.”\n“What?” Dockson asked as he poured a cup of wine.\n“Nothing,” Kelsier said, studying Vin.\n“You want a drink or not, lass?” Dockson asked.\nVin said nothing. All her life, as long as she could remember, she’d had\nher Luck. It made her strong, and it gave her an edge over other thieves. It\nwas probably why she was still alive. Yet, all that time, she’d never really\nknown what it was or why she could use it. Logic and instinct now told her\nthe same thing—that she needed to find out what this man knew.\nHowever he intended to use her, whatever his plans were, she needed to\nendure them. She had to find out how he’d grown so powerful.\n“Ale,” she finally said.\n“Ale?” Kelsier asked. “That’s it?”\nVin nodded, watching him carefully. “I like it.”\nKelsier rubbed his chin. “We’ll have to work on that,” he said. “Anyway,\nhave a seat.”\nHesitant, Vin walked over and sat down opposite Kelsier at the small\ntable. Her wounds throbbed, but she couldn’t afford to show weakness.\nWeakness killed. She had to pretend to ignore the pain. At least, sitting as\nshe was, her head cleared.\nDockson joined them a moment later, giving Kelsier a glass of wine and\nVin her mug of ale. She didn’t take a drink.\n“Who are you?” she asked in a quiet voice.\nKelsier raised an eyebrow. “You’re a blunt one, eh?”\nVin didn’t reply.\nKelsier sighed. “So much for my intriguing air of mystery.”\nDockson snorted quietly.\nKelsier smiled. “My name is Kelsier. I’m what you might call a\ncrewleader—but I run a crew that isn’t like any you’ve probably known.\nMen like Camon, along with his crew, like to think of themselves as\npredators, feeding off of the nobility and the various organizations of the\nMinistry.”\nVin shook her head. “Not predators. Scavengers.” One would have\nthought, perhaps, that so close to the Lord Ruler, such things as thieving\ncrews would not be able to exist. Yet, Reen had shown her that the opposite\nwas true: Powerful, rich nobility congregated around the Lord Ruler. And,\nwhere power and riches existed, so did corruption—especially since the"

And,\nwhere power and riches existed, so did corruption—especially since the\nLord Ruler tended to police his nobility far less than he did the skaa. It had\nto do, apparently, with his fondness for their ancestors.\nEither way, thieving crews like Camon’s were the rats who fed on the\ncity’s corruption. And, like rats, they were impossible to entirely\nexterminate—especially in a city with the population of Luthadel.\n“Scavengers,” Kelsier said, smiling; apparently he did that a lot. “That’s\nan appropriate description, Vin. Well, Dox and I, we’re scavengers too . . .\nwe’re just a higher quality of scavenger. We’re more well-bred, you might\nsay—or perhaps just more ambitious.”\nShe frowned. “You’re noblemen?”\n“Lord, no,” Dockson said.\n“Or, at least,” Kelsier said, “not full-blooded ones.”\n“Half-breeds aren’t supposed to exist,” Vin said carefully. “The Ministry\nhunts them.”\nKelsier raised an eyebrow. “Half-breeds like you?”\nVin felt a shock. How . . .?\n“Even the Steel Ministry isn’t infallible, Vin,” Kelsier said. “If they can\nmiss you, then they can miss others.”\nVin paused thoughtfully. “Milev. He called you Mistings. Those are some\nkind of Allomancer, right?”\nDockson glanced at Kelsier. “She’s observant,” the shorter man said with\nan appreciative nod.\n“Indeed,” Kelsier agreed. “The man did call us Mistings, Vin—though\nthe appellation was a bit hasty, since neither Dox nor I are technically\nMistings. We do, however, associate with them quite a bit.”\nVin sat quietly for a moment, sitting beneath the scrutiny of the two men.\nAllomancy. The mystical power held by the nobility, granted to them by the\nLord Ruler some thousand years before as a reward for their loyalty. It was\nbasic Ministry doctrine; even a skaa like Vin knew that much. The nobility\nhad Allomancy and privilege because of their ancestors; the skaa were\npunished for the same reason.\nThe truth was, however, that she didn’t really know what Allomancy was.\nIt had something to do with fighting, she’d always assumed. One “Misting,”\nas they were called, was said to be dangerous enough to kill an entire\nthieving team. Yet, the skaa she knew spoke of the power in whispered,\nuncertain tones. Before this moment, she’d never even paused to consider\nthe possibility that it might simply be the same thing as her Luck.\n“Tell me, Vin,” Kelsier said, leaning forward with interest. “Do you\nrealize what you did to that obligator in the Canton of Finance?”\n“I used my Luck,” Vin said quietly. “I use it to make people less angry.”\n“Or less suspicious,” Kelsier said. “Easier to scam.”\nVin nodded.\nKelsier held up a finger. “There are a lot of things you’re going to have to\nlearn. Techniques, rules, and exercises. One lesson, however, cannot wait."

One lesson, however, cannot wait.\nNever use emotional Allomancy on an obligator. They’re all trained to\nrecognize when their passions are being manipulated. Even the high\nnobility are forbidden from Pulling or Pushing the emotions of an obligator.\nYou are what caused that obligator to send for an Inquisitor.”\n“Pray the creature never catches your trail again, lass,” Dockson said\nquietly, sipping his wine.\nVin paled. “You didn’t kill the Inquisitor?”\nKelsier shook his head. “I just distracted him for a bit—which was quite\ndangerous enough, I might add. Don’t worry, many of the rumors about\nthem aren’t true. Now that he’s lost your trail, he won’t be able to find you\nagain.”\n“Most likely,” Dockson said.\nVin glanced at the shorter man apprehensively.\n“Most likely,” Kelsier agreed. “There are a lot of things we don’t know\nabout the Inquisitors—they don’t seem to follow the normal rules. Those\nspikes through their eyes, for instance, should kill them. Nothing I’ve\nlearned about Allomancy has ever provided an explanation for how those\ncreatures keep living. If it were only a regular Misting Seeker on your trail,\nwe wouldn’t need to worry. An Inquistor . . . well, you’ll want to keep your\neyes open. Of course, you already seem pretty good at that.”\nVin sat uncomfortably for a moment. Eventually, Kelsier nodded to her\nmug of ale. “You aren’t drinking.”\n“You might have slipped something in it,” Vin said.\n“Oh, there was no need for me to sneak something into your drink,”\nKelsier said with a smile, pulling an object out of his suit coat pocket.\n“After all, you’re going to drink this vial of mysterious liquid quite\nwillingly.”\nHe set a small glass vial on the tabletop. Vin frowned, regarding the\nliquid within. There was a dark residue at its bottom. “What is it?” she\nasked.\n“If I told you, it wouldn’t be mysterious,” Kelsier said with a smile.\nDockson rolled his eyes. “The vial is filled with an alcohol solution and\nsome flakes of metal, Vin.”\n“Metal?” she asked with a frown.\n“Two of the eight basic Allomantic metals,” Kelsier said. “We need to do\nsome tests.”\nVin eyed the vial.\nKelsier shrugged. “You’ll have to drink it if you want to know any more\nabout this Luck of yours.”\n“You drink half first,” Vin said.\nKelsier raised an eyebrow. “A bit on the paranoid side, I see.”\nVin didn’t respond.\nFinally, he sighed, picking up the vial and pulling off the plug.\n“Shake it up first,” Vin said. “So you get some of the sediment.”\nKelsier rolled his eyes, but did as requested, shaking the vial, then\ndowning half of its contents. He set it back on the table with a click.\nVin frowned. Then she eyed Kelsier, who smiled. He knew that he had"

He had shown off his power, had tempted her with it. The only reason\nto be subservient to those with power is so that you can learn to someday\ntake what they have.\nReen’s words.\nVin reached out and took the vial, then she downed its contents. She sat,\nwaiting for some magical transformation or surge of power—or even signs\nof poison. She felt nothing.\nHow . . . anticlimactic. She frowned, leaning back in her chair. Out of\ncuriosity, she felt at her Luck.\nAnd felt her eyes widen in shock.\nIt was there, like a massive golden hoard. A storage of power so\nincredible that it stretched her understanding. Always before, she had\nneeded to be a scrimp with her Luck, holding it in reserve, using up morsels\nsparingly. Now she felt like a starving woman invited to a high nobleman’s\nfeast. She sat, stunned, regarding the enormous wealth within her.\n“So,” Kelsier said with a prodding voice. “Try it. Soothe me.”\nVin reached out, tentatively touching her newfound mass of Luck. She\ntook a bit, and directed it at Kelsier.\n“Good.” Kelsier leaned forward eagerly. “But we already knew you could\ndo that. Now the real test, Vin. Can you go the other way? You can dampen\nmy emotions, but can you enflame them too?”\nVin frowned. She’d never used her Luck in such a way; she hadn’t even\nrealized that she could. Why was he so eager?\nSuspicious, Vin reached for her source of Luck. As she did so, she\nnoticed something interesting. What she had first interpreted as one massive\nsource of power was actually two different sources of power. There were\ndifferent types of Luck.\nEight. He’d said there were eight of them. But . . . what do the others do?\nKelsier was still waiting. Vin reached to the second, unfamiliar source of\nLuck, doing as she’d done before and directing it at him.\nKelsier’s smile deepened, and he sat back, glancing at Dockson. “That’s\nit then. She did it.”\nDockson shook his head. “To be honest, Kell, I’m not sure what to think.\nHaving one of you around was unsettling enough. Two, though . . .”\nVin regarded them with narrowed, dubious eyes. “Two what?”\n“Even among the nobility, Vin, Allomancy is modestly rare,” Kelsier\nsaid. “True, it’s a hereditary skill, with most of its powerful lines among the\nhigh nobility. However, breeding alone doesn’t guarantee Allomantic\nstrength.\n“Many high noblemen only have access to a single Allomantic skill.\nPeople like that—those who can only perform Allomancy in one of its eight\nbasic aspects—are called Mistings. Sometimes these abilities appear in skaa\n—but only if that skaa has noble blood in his or her near ancestry.

Her mother had\ntried to kill her, once, when she was very young. She vaguely remembered\nthe event. Reen had saved her.\n“What about your father, Vin?” Dockson asked.\nVin looked up. “He is a high prelan in the Steel Ministry.”\nKelsier whistled softly. “Now, that’s a slightly ironic breach of duty.”\nVin looked down at the table. Finally, she reached over and took a\nhealthy pull on her mug of ale.\nKelsier smiled. “Most ranking obligators in the Ministry are high\nnoblemen. Your father gave you a rare gift in that blood of yours.”\n“So . . . I’m one of these Mistings you mentioned?”\nKelsier shook his head. “Actually, no. You see, this is what made you so\ninteresting to us, Vin. Mistings only have access to one Allomantic skill.\nYou just proved you have two. And, if you have access to at least two of the\neight, then you have access to the rest as well. That’s the way it works—if\nyou’re an Allomancer, you either get one skill or you get them all.”\nKelsier leaned forward. “You, Vin, are what is generally called a\nMistborn. Even amongst the nobility, they’re incredibly rare. Amongst skaa\n. . . well, let’s just say I’ve only met one other skaa Mistborn in my entire\nlife.”\nSomehow, the room seemed to grow more quiet. More still. Vin stared at\nher mug with distracted, uncomfortable eyes. Mistborn. She’d heard the\nstories, of course. The legends.\nKelsier and Dockson sat quietly, letting her think. Eventually, she spoke.\n“So . . . what does this all mean?”\nKelsier smiled. “It means that you, Vin, are a very special person. You\nhave a power that most high noblemen envy. It is a power that, had you\nbeen born an aristocrat, would have made you one of the most deadly and\ninfluential people in all of the Final Empire.”\nKelsier leaned forward again. “But, you weren’t born an aristocrat.\nYou’re not noble, Vin. You don’t have to play by their rules—and that\nmakes you even more powerful.”\nApparently, the next stage of my quest will take us up into the highlands of Terris. This is said to be a cold, unforgiving place—a land where the mountains themselves are\nmade of ice.\nOur normal attendants will not do for such a trip. We should probably hire some Terris packmen to carry our gear.\n4\n“Y He’s planning a job.” Ulef’s eyes shone with excitement."

We should probably hire some Terris packmen to carry our gear.\n4\n“Y He’s planning a job.” Ulef’s eyes shone with excitement.\nOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID!\n“I wonder which of the Great Houses he’s going to strike.”\n“It’ll be one of the most powerful ones,” said Disten, one of Camon’s\nhead pointmen. He was missing a hand, but his eyes and ears were among\nthe keenest in the crew. “Kelsier never bothers himself with small-time\njobs.”\nVin sat quietly, her mug of ale—the same one Kelsier had given her—\nstill sitting mostly full on the tabletop. Her table was crowded with people;\nKelsier had let the thieves return to their home for a bit before his meeting\nbegan. Vin, however, would have preferred to remain by herself. Life with\nReen had accustomed her to loneliness—if you let someone get too close, it\nwould just give them better opportunities to betray you.\nEven after Reen’s disappearance, Vin had kept to herself. She hadn’t been\nwilling to leave; however, she also hadn’t felt the need to become familiar\nwith the other crewmembers. They had, in turn, been perfectly willing to let\nher alone. Vin’s position had been precarious, and associating with her\ncould have tainted them by association. Only Ulef had made any moves to\nbefriend her.\nIf you let someone get close to you, it will only hurt more when they\nbetray you, Reen seemed to whisper in her mind.\nHad Ulef even really been her friend? He’d certainly sold her out quickly\nenough. In addition, the crewmembers had taken Vin’s beating and sudden\nrescue in stride, never mentioning their betrayal or refusal to help her.\nThey’d only done what was expected.\n“The Survivor hasn’t bothered himself with any jobs lately,” said\nHarmon, an older, scraggly-bearded burglar. “He’s barely been seen in\nLuthadel a handful of times during the last few years. In fact, he hasn’t\npulled any jobs since . . .”\n“This is the first one?” Ulef asked eagerly. “The first since he escaped the\nPits? Then it’s bound to be something spectacular!”\n“Did he say anything about it, Vin?” Disten asked. “Vin?” He waved a\nstumpy arm in her direction, catching her attention.\n“What?” she asked, looking up. She had cleaned herself slightly since her\nbeating at Camon’s hand, finally accepting a handkerchief from Dockson to\nwipe the blood from her face. There was little she could do about the\nbruises, however. Those still throbbed. Hopefully, nothing was broken.\n“Kelsier,” Disten repeated. “Did he say anything about the job he’s\nplanning?”\nVin shook her head. She glanced down at the bloodied handkerchief.\nKelsier and Dockson had left a short time ago, promising to return after\nshe’d had some time to think about the things they had told her. There was\nan implication in their words, however—an offer. Whatever job they were\nplanning, she was invited to participate.\n“Why’d he pick you to be his twixt, anyway, Vin?” Ulef asked. “Did he\nsay anything about that?”"

        "text": "planning, she was invited to participate.\n“Why’d he pick you to be his twixt, anyway, Vin?” Ulef asked. “Did he\nsay anything about that?”\nThat’s what the crew assumed—that Kelsier had chosen her to be his\ncontact with Camon’s . . . Milev’s . . . crew.\nThere were two sides to the Luthadel underground. There were the\nregular crews, like Camon’s. Then there were . . . the special ones. Groups\ncomposed of the extremely skillful, the extremely foolhardy, or the\nextremely talented. Allomancers.\nThe two sides of the underworld didn’t mix; regular thieves left their\nbetters alone. However, occasionally one of these Misting crews hired a\nregular team to do some of its more mundane work, and they would choose\na twixt—a go-between—to work with both crews. Hence Ulef’s assumption\nabout Vin.\nMilev’s crewmembers noticed her unresponsiveness, and turned to\nanother topic: Mistings. They spoke of Allomancy with uncertain,\nwhispered tones, and she listened, uncomfortable. How could she be\nassociated with something they held in such awe? Her Luck . . . her\nAllomancy . . . was something small, something she used to survive, but\nsomething really quite unimportant.\nBut, such power . . . she thought, looking in at her Luck reserve.\n“What’s Kelsier been doing these last few years, I wonder?” Ulef asked.\nHe had seemed a bit uncomfortable around her at the beginning of the\nconversation, but that had passed quickly. He’d betrayed her, but this was\nthe underworld. No friends.\nIt didn’t seem that way between Kelsier and Dockson. They appeared to\ntrust each other. A front? Or were they simply one of those rare teams that\nactually didn’t worry about each other’s betrayal?\nThe most unsettling thing about Kelsier and Dockson had been their\nopenness with her. They seemed willing to trust, even accept, Vin after a\nrelatively short time. It couldn’t be genuine—no one could survive in the\nunderworld following such tactics. Still, their friendliness was\ndisconcerting.\n“Two years . . .” said Hrud, a flat-faced, quiet thug. “He must have spent\nthe entire time planning for this job.”\n“It must be some job indeed. . . .” Ulef said.\n“Tell me about him,” Vin said quietly.\n“Kelsier?” Disten asked.\nVin nodded.\n“They didn’t talk about Kelsier down south?”\nVin shook her head.\n“He was the best crewleader in Luthadel,” Ulef explained. “A legend,\neven among the Mistings. He robbed some of the wealthiest Great Houses\nin the city.”\n“And?” Vin asked.\n“Someone betrayed him,” Harmon said in a quiet voice.\nOf course, Vin thought.\n“The Lord Ruler himself caught Kelsier,” Ulef said. “Sent Kelsier and his\nwife to the Pits of Hathsin. But he escaped. He escaped from the Pits, Vin!\nHe’s the only one who ever has.”\n“And the wife?” Vin asked.\nUlef glanced at Harmon, who shook his head. “She didn’t make it.”\nSo, he’s lost someone too. How can he laugh so much? So honestly?"

So honestly?\n“That’s where he got those scars, you know,” Disten said. “The ones on\nhis arms. He got them at the Pits, from the rocks on a sheer wall he had to\nclimb to escape.”\nHarmon snorted. “That’s not how he got them. He killed an Inquisitor\nwhile escaping—that’s where he got the scars.”\n“I heard he got them fighting one of the monsters that guard the Pits,”\nUlef said. “He reached into its mouth and strangled it from the inside. The\nteeth scraped his arms.”\nDisten frowned. “How do you strangle someone from the inside?”\nUlef shrugged. “That’s just what I heard.”\n“The man isn’t natural,” Hrud muttered. “Something happened to him in\nthe Pits, something bad. He wasn’t an Allomancer before then, you know.\nHe entered the Pits a regular skaa, and now . . . Well, he’s a Misting for sure\n—if he’s even human anymore.

They’ll grab a man and take his face, sure as the Lord Ruler.”\nHarmon rolled his eyes.\n“Hrud’s right about one thing,” Disten said. “That man isn’t human. He\nmight not be a mistwraith, but he’s not skaa either. I’ve heard of him doing\nthings, things like only they can do. The ones that come out at night. You\nsaw what he did to Camon.”\n“Mistborn,” Harmon muttered.\nMistborn. Vin had heard the term before Kelsier had mentioned it to her,\nof course. Who hadn’t? Yet, the rumors about Mistborn made stories of\nInquisitors and Mistings seem rational. It was said that Mistborn were\nheralds of the mists themselves, endowed with great powers by the Lord\nRuler. Only high noblemen could be Mistborn; they were said to be a secret\nsect of assassins who served him, only going out at night. Reen had always\ntaught her that they were a myth, and Vin had assumed he was right.\nAnd Kelsier says I—like he himself—am one of them. How could she be\nwhat he said? Child of a prostitute, she was nobody. She was nothing.\nNever trust a man who tells you good news, Reen had always said. It’s the\noldest, but easiest, way to con someone.\nYet, she did have her Luck. Her Allomancy. She could still sense the\nreserves Kelsier’s vial had given her, and had tested her powers on the\ncrewmembers. No longer limited to just a bit of Luck a day, she found she\ncould produce far more striking effects."

No longer limited to just a bit of Luck a day, she found she\ncould produce far more striking effects.\nVin was coming to realize that her old goal in life—simply staying alive\n—was uninspired. There was so much more she could be doing. She had\nbeen a slave to Reen; she had been a slave to Camon. She would be a slave\nto this Kelsier too, if it would lead her to eventual freedom.\nAt his table, Milev looked at his pocket watch, then stood. “All right,\neveryone out.”\nThe room began to clear in preparation for Kelsier’s meeting. Vin\nremained where she was; Kelsier had made it quite clear to the others that\nshe was invited. She sat quietly for a bit, the room feeling far more\ncomfortable to her now that it was empty. Kelsier’s friends began to arrive a\nshort time later.\nThe first man down the steps had the build of a soldier. He wore a loose,\nsleeveless shirt that exposed a pair of well-sculpted arms. He was\nimpressively muscular, but not massive, and had close-cropped hair that\nstuck up slightly on his head.\nThe soldier’s companion was a sharply dressed man in a nobleman’s suit\n—plum vest, gold buttons, black overcoat—complete with short-brimmed\nhat and dueling cane. He was older than the soldier, and was a bit portly. He\nremoved his hat upon entering the room, revealing a head of well-styled\nblack hair. The two men were chatting amiably as they walked, but they\npaused when they saw the empty room.\n“Ah, this must be our twixt,” said the man in the suit. “Has Kelsier\narrived yet, my dear?” He spoke with a simple familiarity, as if they were\nlongtime friends. Suddenly, despite herself, Vin found herself liking this\nwell-dressed, articulate man.\n“No,” she said quietly. Though overalls and a work shirt had always\nsuited her, she suddenly wished that she owned something nicer. This man’s\nvery bearing seemed to demand a more formal atmosphere.\n“Should have known that Kell would be late to his own meeting,” the\nsoldier said, sitting down at one of the tables near the center of the room.\n“Indeed,” said the suited man. “I suppose his tardiness leaves us with a\nchance for some refreshment. I could so use something to drink. . . .”\n“Let me get you something,” Vin said quickly, jumping to her feet.\n“How gracious of you,” the suited man said, choosing a chair next to the\nsoldier. He sat with one leg crossed over the other, his dueling cane held to\nthe side, tip against the floor, one hand resting on the top.\nVin walked to the bar and began rummaging for drinks.\n“Breeze . . .” the soldier said with a warning tone as Vin selected a bottle\nof Camon’s most expensive wine and began pouring a cup.\n“Hum . . .?” the suited man said, raising an eyebrow.\nThe soldier nodded toward Vin.\n“Oh, very well,” the suited man said with a sigh.\nVin paused, wine half poured, and frowned slightly.

Pushing on emotions—Soothing them—\nmakes a person more trusting.”\n“Regardless, you controlled me,” Vin said. “You made me fetch you a\ndrink.”\n“Oh, I wouldn’t say that I made you do it,” Breeze said. “I just altered\nyour emotions slightly, putting you in a frame of mind where you’d be more\nlikely to do as I wished.”\nHam rubbed his chin. “I don’t know, Breeze. It’s an interesting question.\nBy influencing her emotions, did you take away her ability to choose? If,\nfor instance, she were to kill or steal while under your control, would the\ncrime be hers or yours?”\nBreeze rolled his eyes. “There’s really no question to it at all. You\nshouldn’t think about such things, Hammond—you’ll hurt your brain. I\noffered her encouragement, I simply did it through an irregular means.”\n“But—”\n“I’m not going to argue it with you, Ham.”\nThe beefy man sighed, looking a little bit forlorn.\n“Are you going to bring me the drink . . .?” Breeze asked hopefully,\nlooking at Vin. “I mean, you’re already up, and you’re going to have to\ncome back this direction to reach your seat anyway. . . .”\nVin examined her emotions. Did she feel irregularly drawn to do as the\nman asked? Was he manipulating her again? Finally, she simply walked\naway from the bar, leaving the drink where it was.\nBreeze sighed. He didn’t stand to go get the drink himself, however.\nVin walked tentatively toward the two men’s table. She was accustomed\nto shadows and corners—close enough to eavesdrop, but far enough away\nto escape. Yet, she couldn’t hide from these men—not while the room was\nso empty. So, she chose a chair at the table beside the one that the two men\nwere using, then sat cautiously. She needed information—as long as she\nwas ignorant, she was going to be at a severe disadvantage in this new\nworld of Misting crews."

She needed information—as long as she\nwas ignorant, she was going to be at a severe disadvantage in this new\nworld of Misting crews.\nBreeze chuckled. “Nervous little thing, aren’t you?”\nVin ignored the comment. “You,” Vin said, nodding to Ham. “You’re a . .\n. a Misting too?”\nHam nodded. “I’m a Thug.”\nVin frowned in confusion.\n“I burn pewter,” Ham said.\nAgain, Vin looked at him questioningly.\n“He can make himself stronger, my dear,” Breeze said. “He hits things—\nparticularly other people—who try to interfere with what the rest of us are\ndoing.”\n“There’s much more to it than that,” Ham said. “I run general security for\njobs, providing my crewleader with manpower and warriors, assuming such\nare necessary.”\n“And he’ll try and bore you with random philosophy when it isn’t,”\nBreeze added.\nHam sighed. “Breeze, honestly, sometimes I don’t know why I . . .” Ham\ntrailed off as the door opened again, admitting another man.\nThe newcomer wore a dull tan overcoat, a pair of brown trousers, and a\nsimple white shirt. However, his face was far more distinctive than his\nclothing. It was knotted and gnarled, like a twisted piece of wood, and his\neyes shone with the level of disapproving dissatisfaction only the elderly\ncan display. Vin couldn’t quite place his age—he was young enough that he\nwasn’t stooped over, yet he was old enough that he made even the middle-\naged Breeze look youthful.\nThe newcomer looked over Vin and the others, huffed disdainfully, then\nwalked to a table on the other side of the room and sat down. His steps were\nmarked by a distinct limp.\nBreeze sighed. “I’m going to miss Trap.”\n“We all will,” Ham said quietly. “Clubs is very good, though. I’ve\nworked with him before.”\nBreeze studied the newcomer. “I wonder if I could get him to bring my\ndrink over. . . .”\nHam chuckled. “I’d pay money to see you try it.”\n“I’m sure you would,” Breeze said.\nVin eyed the newcomer, who seemed perfectly content to ignore her and\nthe other two men. “What’s he?”\n“Clubs?” Breeze asked. “He, my dear, is a Smoker. He is what will keep\nthe rest of us from being discovered by an Inquisitor.”\nVin chewed on her lip, digesting the new information as she studied\nClubs. The man shot her a glare, and she looked away. As she turned, she\nnoticed that Ham was looking at her.\n“I like you, kid,” he said. “The other twixts I’ve worked with have either\nbeen too intimidated to talk to us, or they’ve been jealous of us for moving\ninto their territory.”\n“Indeed,” Breeze said. “You’re not like most crumbs. Of course, I’d like\nyou a great deal more if you’d go fetch me that glass of wine. . . .”\nVin ignored him, glancing at Ham. “Crumb?”\n“That’s what some of the more self-important members of our society\ncall lesser thieves,” Ham said. “They call you crumbs, since you tend to be"

She glared at Breeze. “Stop that!”\n“See, there,” Breeze said, glancing at Ham. “She still retains her ability\nto choose.”\n“You’re hopeless.”\nThey assume I’m a twixt, Vin thought. So Kelsier hasn’t told them what I\nam. Why? Time constraints? Or, was the secret too valuable to share? How\ntrustworthy were these men? And, if they thought her a simple “crumb,”\nwhy were they being so nice to her?\n“Who else are we waiting upon?” Breeze asked, glancing at the doorway.\n“Besides Kell and Dox, I mean.”\n“Yeden,” Ham said.\nBreeze frowned with a sour expression. “Ah, yes.”\n“I agree,” Ham said. “But, I’d be willing to bet that he feels the same\nway about us.”\n“I don’t even see why he was invited,” Breeze said.\nHam shrugged. “Something to do with Kell’s plan, obviously.”\n“Ah, the infamous ‘plan,’ ” Breeze said musingly. “What job could it be,\nwhat indeed . . .?”\nHam shook his head. “Kell and his cursed sense of drama.”\n“Indeed.”\nThe door opened a few moments later, and the one they had spoken of,\nYeden, entered. He turned out to be an unassuming man, and Vin had\ntrouble understanding why the other two were so displeased about his\nattendance. Short with curly brown hair, Yeden was dressed in simple gray\nskaa clothing and a patched, soot-stained brown worker’s coat. He regarded\nthe surroundings with a look of disapproval, but he was nowhere near as\nopenly hostile as Clubs, who still sat on the other side of the room scowling\nat anyone who looked in his direction.\nNot a very big crew, Vin thought. With Kelsier and Dockson, that makes\nsix of them. Of course, Ham had said that he led a group of “Thugs.” Were\nthe men at this meeting simply representatives? The leaders of smaller,\nmore specialized groups? Some crews worked that way.\nBreeze checked his pocket watch three more times before Kelsier finally\narrived. The Mistborn crewleader burst through the door with his cheery\nenthusiasm, Dockson sauntering along behind. Ham stood immediately,\nsmiling broadly and clasping hands with Kelsier. Breeze stood as well, and\nwhile his greeting was a bit more reserved, Vin had to admit that she had\nnever seen any crewleader welcomed so happily by his men.\n“Ah,” Kelsier said, looking toward the other side of the room. “Clubs and\nYeden too. So, everyone’s here. Good—I absolutely loathe being made to\nwait.”\nBreeze raised an eyebrow as he and Ham settled back into their chairs,\nDockson taking a seat at the same table. “Are we to receive any explanation"

He turned and leaned back against the bar,\nscanning the room. When Kelsier’s eyes fell on Vin, he winked.\n“Your brother?” Ham said. “Is Marsh coming to the meeting?”\nKelsier and Dockson shared a look. “Not tonight,” Kelsier said. “But\nhe’ll join the crew eventually.”\nVin studied the others. They were skeptical. Tension between Kelsier and\nhis brother, perhaps?\nBreeze raised his dueling cane, pointing the tip at Kelsier. “All right,\nKelsier, you’ve kept this ‘job’ secret from us for eight months now. We\nknow it’s big, we know you’re excited, and we’re all properly annoyed at\nyou for being so secretive. So, why don’t you just go ahead and tell us what\nit is?”\nKelsier smiled. Then he stood up straight, waving a hand toward the\ndirty, plain-looking Yeden. “Gentlemen, meet your new employer.”\nThis was, apparently, quite a shocking statement.\n“Him?” Ham asked.\n“Him,” Kelsier said with a nod.\n“What?” Yeden asked, speaking for the first time. “You have trouble\nworking with someone who actually has morals?”\n“It’s not that, my dear man,” Breeze said, setting his dueling cane across\nhis lap. “It’s just that, well, I was under the strange impression that you\ndidn’t like our types very much.”\n“I don’t,” Yeden said flatly. “You’re selfish, undisciplined, and you’ve\nturned your backs on the rest of the skaa. You dress nicely, but on the inside\nyou’re dirty as ash.”\nHam snorted. “I can already see that this job is going to be great for crew\nmorale.”\nVin watched quietly, chewing on her lip. Yeden was obviously a skaa\nworker, probably a member of a forge or textile mill. What connection did\nhe have with the underground? And . . . how would he be able to afford the\nservices of a thieving crew, especially one as apparently specialized as\nKelsier’s team?\nPerhaps Kelsier noticed her confusion, for she found him looking at her\nas the others continued to speak.\n“I’m still a little confused,” Ham said. “Yeden, we’re all aware of how\nyou regard thieves. So . . . why hire us?”\nYeden squirmed a bit. “Because,” he finally said, “everyone knows how\neffective you are.”\nBreeze chuckled. “Disapproving of our morals doesn’t make you\nunwilling to make use of our skills, I see. So, what is the job, then? What\ndoes the skaa rebellion wish of us?”\nSkaa rebellion? Vin thought, a piece of the conversation falling into\nplace. There were two sides to the underworld. The far larger portion was\nmade up of the thieves, crews, whores, and beggars who tried to survive\noutside of mainstream skaa culture.\nAnd then there were the rebels.

The people who worked against the Final\nEmpire. Reen had always called them fools—a sentiment shared by most of\nthe people, both underworlders and regular skaa, that Vin had met.\nAll eyes slowly turned to Kelsier, who leaned back against the bar again.\n“The skaa rebellion, courtesy of its leader, Yeden, has hired us for\nsomething very specific.”\n“What?” Ham asked. “Robbery? Assassination?”\n“A little of both,” Kelsier said, “and, at the same time, neither one.\nGentlemen, this isn’t going to be a regular job. It’s going to be different\nfrom anything any crew has ever tried to pull. We’re going to help Yeden\noverthrow the Final Empire.”\nSilence.\n“Excuse me?” Ham asked.\n“You heard me right, Ham,” Kelsier said. “That’s the job I’ve been\nplanning—the destruction of the Final Empire. Or, at least, its center of\ngovernment. Yeden has hired us to supply him with an army, then provide\nhim with a favorable opportunity to seize control of this city.”\nHam sat back, then shared a glance with Breeze. Both men turned toward\nDockson, who nodded solemnly. The room remained quiet for a moment\nlonger; then the silence was broken as Yeden began to laugh ruefully to\nhimself.\n“I should never have agreed to this,” Yeden said, shaking his head. “Now\nthat you say it, I realize how ridiculous it all sounds.”\n“Trust me, Yeden,” Kelsier said. “These men have made a habit of\npulling off plans that seem ridiculous at first glance.”\n“That may be true, Kell,” Breeze said. “But, in this case, I find myself\nagreeing with our disapproving friend. Overthrow the Final Empire . . . that\nis something that skaa rebels have been working toward for a thousand\nyears! What makes you think that we can achieve anything where those\nmen have failed?”\nKelsier smiled. “We’ll succeed because we have vision, Breeze. That’s\nsomething the rebellion has always lacked.”\n“Excuse me?” Yeden said indignantly.\n“It’s true, unfortunately,” Kelsier said. “The rebellion condemns people\nlike us because of our greed, but for all their high morals—which, by the\nway, I respect—they never get anything done. Yeden, your men hide in\nwoods and in hills, plotting how they’ll someday rise up and lead a glorious\nwar against the Final Empire. But your kind has no idea how to develop and\nexecute a proper plan.”\nYeden’s expression grew dark. “And you have no idea what you are\ntalking about.”\n“Oh?” Kelsier said lightly. “Tell me, what has your rebellion\naccomplished during its thousand-year struggle? Where are your successes\nand your victories? The Massacre of Tougier three centuries ago, where\nseven thousand skaa rebels were slaughtered? The occasional raid of a\ntraveling canal boat or the kidnapping of a minor noble official?”\nYeden flushed. “That’s the best we can manage with the people we have!\nDon’t blame my men for their failures—blame the rest of the skaa. We can’t"

They’ve been beaten down for a millennium; they\nhaven’t got any spirit left. It’s difficult enough to get one in a thousand to\nlisten to us, let alone rebel!”\n“Peace, Yeden,” Kelsier said, holding up a hand. “I’m not trying to insult\nyour courage. We’re on the same side, remember? You came to me\nspecifically because you were having trouble recruiting people for your\narmy.”\n“I’m regretting that decision more and more, thief,” Yeden said.\n“Well, you’ve already paid us,” Kelsier said. “So it’s a little late to back\nout now. But, we’ll get you that army, Yeden. The men in this room are the\nmost capable, most clever, and most skilled Allomancers in the city. You’ll\nsee.”\nThe room grew quiet again. Vin sat at her table, watching the interaction\nwith a frown. What is your game, Kelsier? His words about overthrowing\nthe Final Empire were obviously a front. It seemed most likely to her that\nhe intended to scam the skaa rebellion. But . . . if he’d already been paid,\nthen why continue the charade?\nKelsier turned from Yeden to Breeze and Ham. “All right, gentlemen.\nWhat do you think?”\nThe two men shared a look. Finally Breeze spoke. “Lord Ruler knows,\nI’ve never been one to turn down a challenge. But, Kell, I do question your\nreasoning. Are you sure we can do this?”\n“I’m positive,” Kelsier said. “Previous attempts to overthrow the Lord\nRuler have failed because they lacked proper organization and planning.\nWe’re thieves, gentlemen—and we’re extraordinarily good ones. We can\nrob the unrobbable and fool the unfoolable. We know how to take an\nincredibly large task and break it down to manageable pieces, then deal\nwith each of those pieces. We know how to get what we want. These things\nmake us perfect for this particular task.”\nBreeze frowned. “And . . . how much are we getting paid for achieving\nthe impossible?”\n“Thirty thousand boxings,” Yeden said. “Half now, half when you deliver\nthe army.”\n“Thirty thousand?” Ham said. “For an operation this big? That will\nbarely cover expenses. We’ll need a spy among the nobility to watch for\nrumors, we’ll need a couple of safe houses, not to mention someplace big\nenough to hide and train an entire army. . . .”\n“No use haggling now, thief,” Yeden snapped. “Thirty thousand may not\nsound like much to your type, but it’s the result of decades of saving on our\npart. We can’t pay you more because we don’t have anything more.”\n“It’s good work, gentlemen,” Dockson noted, joining the conversation for\nthe first time.\n“Yes, well, that’s all great,” Breeze said. “I consider myself a nice\nenough fellow. But . . . this just seems a bit too altruistic. Not to mention\nstupid.”"

Not to mention\nstupid.”\n“Well . . .” Kelsier said, “there might be a little bit more in it for us. . . .”\nVin perked up, and Breeze smiled.\n“The Lord Ruler’s treasury,” Kelsier said. “The plan, as it stands now, is\nto provide Yeden with an army and an opportunity to seize the city. Once he\ntakes the palace, he’ll capture the treasury and use its funds to secure power.\nAnd, central to that treasury . . .”\n“Is the Lord Ruler’s atium,” Breeze said.\nKelsier nodded. “Our agreement with Yeden promises us half of the\natium reserves we find in the palace, no matter how vast they may be.”\nAtium. Vin had heard of the metal, but she had never actually seen any. It\nwas incredibly rare, supposedly used only by noblemen.\nHam was smiling. “Well, now,” he said slowly, “that’s almost a big\nenough prize to be tempting.”\n“That atium stockpile is supposed to be enormous,” Kelsier said. “The\nLord Ruler sells the metal only in small bits, charging outrageous sums to\nthe nobility. He has to keep a huge reserve of it to make certain he controls\nthe market, and to make certain he has enough wealth for emergencies.”\n“True . . .” Breeze said. “But, are you sure you want to try something like\nthis so soon after . . . what happened the last time we tried getting into the\npalace?”\n“We’re going to do things differently this time,” Kelsier said.\n“Gentlemen, I’ll be frank with you. This isn’t going to be an easy job, but it\ncan work. The plan is simple. We’re going to find a way to neutralize the\nLuthadel Garrison—leaving the area without a policing force. Then, we’re\ngoing to throw the city into chaos.”\n“We’ve got a couple of options on how to do that,” Dockson said. “But\nwe can talk about that later.”\nKelsier nodded. “Then, in that chaos, Yeden will march his army into\nLuthadel and seize the palace, taking the Lord Ruler prisoner. While Yeden\nsecures the city, we’ll pilfer the atium. We’ll give half to him, then\ndisappear with the other half. After that, it’s his job to hang on to what he’s\ngrabbed.”\n“Sounds a little dangerous for you, Yeden,” Ham noted, glancing at the\nrebel leader.\nHe shrugged. “Perhaps. But, if we do, by some miracle, end up in control\nof the palace, then we’ll have at least done something no skaa rebellion has\never achieved before. For my men, this isn’t just about riches—it isn’t even\nabout surviving. It’s about doing something grand, something wonderful, to\ngive the skaa hope. But, I don’t expect you people to understand things like\nthat.”\nKelsier shot a quieting glance at Yeden, and the man sniffed and sat back.\nDid he use Allomancy? Vin wondered.

She’d seen employer-crew\nrelationships before, and it seemed that Yeden was much more in Kelsier’s\npocket than the other way around.\nKelsier turned back to Ham and Breeze. “There’s more to all this than\nsimply a show of daring. If we do manage to steal that atium, it will be a\nsound blow to the Lord Ruler’s financial foundation. He depends on the\nmoney that atium provides—without it, he could very well be left without\nthe means to pay his armies.\n“Even if he escapes our trap—or, if we decide to take the city when he’s\ngone to minimize having to deal with him—he’ll be financially ruined. He\nwon’t be able to march soldiers in to take the city away from Yeden. If this\nworks right, we’ll have the city in chaos anyway, and the nobility will be\ntoo weak to react against the rebel forces. The Lord Ruler will be left\nconfused, and unable to mount a sizable army.”\n“And the koloss?” Ham asked quietly.\nKelsier paused. “If he marches those creatures on his own capital city, the\ndestruction it would cause could be even more dangerous than financial\ninstability. In the chaos, the provincial noblemen will rebel and set\nthemselves up as kings, and the Lord Ruler won’t have the troops to bring\nthem into line. Yeden’s rebels will be able to hold Luthadel, and we, my\nfriends, will be very, very rich. Everyone gets what they want.”\n“You’re forgetting the Steel Ministry,” Clubs snapped, sitting almost\nforgotten at the side of the room. “Those Inquisitors won’t just let us throw\ntheir pretty theocracy into chaos.”\nKelsier paused, turning toward the gnarled man. “We will have to find a\nway to deal with the Ministry—I’ve got a few plans for that. Either way,\nproblems like that are the things that we—as a crew—will have to work\nout. We have to get rid of the Luthadel Garrison—there’s no way we’ll be\nable to get anything done with them policing the streets. We’ll have to come\nup with an appropriate way to throw the city into chaos, and we’ll have to\nfind a way to keep the obligators off our trail.\n“But, if we play this right, we might be able to force the Lord Ruler to\nsend the palace guard—maybe even the Inquisitors—into the city to restore\norder. That will leave the palace itself exposed, giving Yeden a perfect\nopportunity to strike. After that, it won’t matter what happens with the\nMinistry or the Garrison—the Lord Ruler won’t have the money to\nmaintain control of his empire.”\n“I don’t know, Kell,” Breeze said, shaking his head. His flippancy was\nsubdued; he seemed to be honestly considering the plan. “The Lord Ruler\ngot that atium somewhere. What if he just goes and mines some more?”\nHam nodded. “No one even knows where the atium mine is.”\n“I wouldn’t say no one,” Kelsier said with a smile.\nBreeze and Ham shared a look.\n“You know?” Ham asked."

It’s not just a\npenal colony, not just a hellhole where skaa are sent to die. It’s a mine.”\n“Of course . . .” Breeze said.\nKelsier stood up straight, stepping away from the bar and walking toward\nHam and Breeze’s table. “We have a chance here, gentlemen. A chance to\ndo something great—something no other thieving crew has ever done. We’ll\nrob from the Lord Ruler himself!\n“But, there’s more. The Pits nearly killed me, and I’ve seen things . . .\ndifferently since I escaped. I see the skaa, working without hope. I see the\nthieving crews, trying to survive on aristocratic leavings, often getting\nthemselves—and other skaa—killed in the process. I see the skaa rebellion\ntrying so hard to resist the Lord Ruler, and never making any progress.\n“The rebellion fails because it’s too unwieldy and spread out. Anytime\none of its many pieces gains momentum, the Steel Ministry crushes it.\nThat’s not the way to defeat the Final Empire, gentlemen. But, a small team\n—specialized and highly skilled—has a hope. We can work without great\nrisk of exposure. We know how to avoid the Steel Ministry’s tendrils. We\nunderstand how the high nobility thinks, and how to exploit its members.\nWe can do this!”\nHe paused beside Breeze and Ham’s table.\n“I don’t know, Kell,” Ham said. “It’s not that I’m disagreeing with your\nmotives. It’s just that . . . well, this seems a bit foolhardy.”\nKelsier smiled. “I know it does. But you’re going to go along with it\nanyway, aren’t you?”\nHam paused, then nodded. “You know I’ll join your crew no matter what\nthe job. This sounds crazy, but so do most of your plans. Just . . . just tell\nme. Are you serious about overthrowing the Lord Ruler?”\nKelsier nodded. For some reason, Vin was almost tempted to believe him.\nHam nodded firmly. “All right, then. I’m in.”\n“Breeze?” Kelsier asked.\nThe well-dressed man shook his head. “I’m not sure, Kell. This is a bit\nextreme, even for you.”\n“We need you, Breeze,” Kell said. “No one can Soothe a crowd like you\ncan. If we’re going to raise an army, we’ll need your Allomancers—and\nyour powers.”\n“Well, that much is true,” Breeze said. “But, even still . . .”\nKelsier smiled, then he set something on the table—the cup of wine Vin\nhad poured for Breeze.

Clubs sat\nwith folded arms, regarding Kelsier with a scowl. “What are you really\nplanning, Kelsier?”\n“I’m being honest,” Kelsier replied. “I plan to take the Lord Ruler’s\natium and overthrow his empire.”\n“You can’t,” the man said. “It’s idiocy. The Inquisitors will hang us all by\nhooks through our throats.”\n“Perhaps,” Kelsier said. “But think of the reward if we succeed. Wealth,\npower, and a land where the skaa can live like men, rather than slaves.”\nClubs snorted loudly. Then he stood, his chair toppling backward onto\nthe floor behind him. “No reward would be enough. The Lord Ruler tried to\nhave you killed once—I see that you won’t be satisfied until he gets it\nright.” With that, the older man turned and stalked in a limping gait from\nthe room, slamming the door behind him.\nThe lair grew quiet.\n“Well, guess we’ll need a different Smoker,” Dockson said.\n“You’re just going to let him go?” Yeden demanded. “He knows\neverything!”\nBreeze chuckled. “Aren’t you supposed to be the moral one in this little\ngroup?”\n“Morals doesn’t have anything to do with it,” Yeden said. “Letting\nsomeone go like that is foolish! He could bring the obligators down on us in\nminutes.”\nVin nodded in agreement, but Kelsier just shook his head. “I don’t work\nthat way, Yeden. I invited Clubs to a meeting where I outlined a dangerous\nplan—one some people might even call stupid. I’m not going to have him\nassassinated because he decided it was too dangerous. If you do things like\nthat, pretty soon nobody will come listen to your plans in the first place.”\n“Besides,” Dockson said. “We wouldn’t invite someone to one of these\nmeetings unless we trusted him not to betray us.”\nImpossible, Vin thought, frowning. He had to be bluffing to keep up crew\nmorale; nobody was that trusting. After all, hadn’t the others said that\nKelsier’s failure a few years before—the event that had sent him to the Pits\nof Hathsin—had come because of a betrayal? He probably had assassins\nfollowing Clubs at that very moment, watching to make certain he didn’t go\nto the authorities.\n“All right, Yeden,” Kelsier said, getting back to business. “They\naccepted. The plan is on. Are you still in?”\n“Will you give the rebellion’s money back if I say no?” Yeden asked.\nThe only response to that was a quiet chuckle from Ham. Yeden’s\nexpression darkened, but he just shook his head. “If I had any other option .\n. .”"

The job doesn’t matter, as long as I learn what he knows.\nKelsier waited expectantly.\n“I’m in,” Vin said, assuming that was what he wanted to hear.\nShe must have guessed correctly, for Kelsier smiled, then nodded to the\nlast chair at the table.\nVin sighed, but did as he indicated, standing and walking over to take the\nlast seat.\n“Who is the child?” Yeden asked.\n“Twixt,” Breeze said.\nKelsier cocked an eyebrow. “Actually, Vin is something of a new recruit.\nMy brother caught her Soothing his emotions a few months back.”\n“Soother, eh?” Ham asked. “Guess we can always use another of those.”\n“Actually,” Kelsier noted, “it seems she can Riot people’s emotions as\nwell.”\nBreeze started.\n“Really?” Ham asked.\nKelsier nodded. “Dox and I tested her just a few hours ago.”\nBreeze chuckled. “And here I was telling her that she’d probably never\nmeet another Mistborn besides yourself.”\n“A second Mistborn on the team . . .” Ham said appreciatively. “Well,\nthat increases our chances somewhat.”\n“What are you saying?” Yeden sputtered. “Skaa can’t be Mistborn. I’m\nnot even sure if Mistborn exist! I’ve certainly never met one.”\nBreeze raised an eyebrow, then laid a hand on Yeden’s shoulder. “You\nshould try not to talk so much, friend,” he suggested. “You’ll sound far less\nstupid that way.”\nYeden shook off Breeze’s hand, and Ham laughed. Vin, however, sat\nquietly, considering the implications of what Kelsier had said. The part\nabout stealing the atium reserves was tempting, but seizing the city to do it?\nWere these men really that reckless?\nKelsier pulled a chair over to the table for himself and sat down on it the\nwrong way, resting his arms on the seatback. “All right,” he said. “We have\na crew. We’ll plan specifics at the next meeting, but I want you all to be\nthinking about the job. I have some plans, but I want fresh minds to\nconsider our task. We’ll need to discuss ways to get the Luthadel Garrison\nout of the city, and ways that we can throw this place into so much chaos\nthat the Great Houses can’t mobilize their forces to stop Yeden’s army when\nit attacks.”\nThe members of the group, save Yeden, nodded.\n“Before we end for the evening, however,” Kelsier continued, “there is"

You can’t kill him. Even capturing him will\nprobably prove impossible.”\nKelsier didn’t reply. His eyes, however, were determined.\nThat’s it, Vin thought. He has to be insane.\n“The Lord Ruler and I,” Kelsier said quietly, “we have an unsettled debt.\nHe took Mare from me, and he nearly took my own sanity as well. I’ll\nadmit to you all that part of my reason for this plan is to get revenge on\nhim. We’re going to take his government, his home, and his fortune from\nhim.\n“However, for that to work, we’ll have to get rid of him. Perhaps\nimprison him in his own dungeons—at the very least, we’ll have to get him\nout of the city. However, I can think of something far better than either\noption. Down those pits where he sent me, I Snapped and came to an\nawakening of my Allomantic powers. Now I intend to use them to kill him.”\nKelsier reached into his suit pocket and pulled something out. He set it\non the table.\n“In the north, they have a legend,” Kelsier said. “It teaches that the Lord\nRuler isn’t immortal—not completely. They say he can be killed with the\nright metal. The Eleventh Metal. That metal.”\nEyes turned toward the object on the table. It was a thin bar of metal,\nperhaps as long and wide as Vin’s small finger, with straight sides. It was\nsilvery white in color.\n“The Eleventh Metal?” Breeze asked uncertainly. “I’ve heard of no such\nlegend.”\n“The Lord Ruler has suppressed it,” Kelsier said. “But it can still be\nfound, if you know where to look. Allomantic theory teaches of ten metals:\nthe eight basic metals, and the two high metals. There is another one,\nhowever, unknown to most. One far more powerful, even, than the other\nten.”\nBreeze frowned skeptically.\nYeden, however, appeared intrigued. “And, this metal can somehow kill\nthe Lord Ruler?”\nKelsier nodded. “It’s his weakness. The Steel Ministry wants you to\nbelieve that he’s immortal, but even he can be killed—by an Allomancer\nburning this.”\nHam reached out, picking up the thin bar of metal. “Where did you get\nit?”\n“In the north,” Kelsier said. “In a land near the Far Peninsula, a land\nwhere people still remember what their old kingdom was called in the days\nbefore the Ascension.”\n“How does it work?” Breeze asked.\n“I’m not sure,” Kelsier said frankly. “But I intend to find out.”\nHam regarded the porcelain-colored metal, turning it over his fingers."

Vin thought. The Lord Ruler was a force, like the\nwinds or the mists. One did not kill such things. They didn’t live, really.\nThey simply were.\n“Regardless,” Kelsier said, accepting the metal back from Ham, “you\ndon’t need to worry about this. Killing the Lord Ruler is my task. If it\nproves impossible, we’ll settle for tricking him outside of the city, then\nrobbing him silly. I just thought that you should know what I’m planning.”\nI’ve bound myself to a madman, Vin thought with resignation. But that\ndidn’t really matter—not as long as he taught her Allomancy.\nI don’t even understand what I’m supposed to do. The Terris philosophers claim that I’ll know my duty when the time comes, but that’s a small comfort.\nThe Deepness must be destroyed, and apparently I’m the only one who can do so. It ravages the world even now. If I don’t stop it soon, there will be nothing left of\nthis land but bones and dust.\n5\nA K from behind Camon’s bar, a look of\n“ HA!” ELSIER’S TRIUMPHANT FIGURE POPPED UP\nsatisfaction on his face. He brought his arm up and thunked a dusty wine\nbottle down on the countertop.\nDockson looked over with amusement. “Where’d you find it?”\n“One of the secret drawers,” Kelsier said, dusting off the bottle.\n“I thought I’d found all of those,” Dockson said.\n“You did. One of them had a false back.”\nDockson chuckled. “Clever.”\nKelsier nodded, unstoppering the bottle and pouring out three cups. “The\ntrick is to never stop looking. There’s always another secret.” He gathered\nup the three cups and walked over to join Vin and Dockson at the table.\nVin accepted her cup with a tentative hand. The meeting had ended a\nshort time earlier, Breeze, Ham, and Yeden leaving to ponder the things\nKelsier had told them. Vin felt that she should have left as well, but she had\nnowhere to go. Dockson and Kelsier seemed to take it for granted that she\nwould remain with them.\nKelsier took a long sip of the rubicund wine, then smiled. “Ah, that’s\nmuch better.”\nDockson nodded in agreement, but Vin didn’t taste her own drink.\n“We’re going to need another Smoker,” Dockson noted.\nKelsier nodded. “The others seemed to take it well, though.”\n“Breeze is still uncertain,” Dockson said.\n“He won’t back out. Breeze likes a challenge, and he’ll never find a\nchallenge greater than this one.” Kelsier smiled. “Besides, it’d drive him\ninsane to know that we were pulling a job that he wasn’t in on.”\n“Still, he’s right to be apprehensive,” Dockson said. “I’m a little worried\nmyself.”\nKelsier nodded his agreement, and Vin frowned. So, are they serious"

Or is this still a show for my sake? The two men seemed so\ncompetent. Yet, overthrowing the Final Empire? They’d sooner stop the\nmists from flowing or the sun from rising.\n“When do your other friends get here?” Dockson asked.\n“A couple days,” Kelsier said. “We’ll need to have another Smoker by\nthen. I’m also going to need some more atium.”\nDockson frowned. “Already?”\nKelsier nodded. “I spent most of it buying OreSeur’s Contract, then used\nmy last bit at Tresting’s plantation.”\nTresting. The nobleman who had been killed in his manor the week\nbefore. How was Kelsier involved? And, what was it Kelsier said before\nabout atium? He’d claimed that the Lord Ruler kept control of the high\nnobility by maintaining a monopoly on the metal.\nDockson rubbed his bearded chin. “Atium’s not easy to come by, Kell. It\ntook nearly eight months of planning to steal you that last bit.”\n“That’s because you had to be delicate,” Kelsier said with a devious\nsmile.\nDockson eyed Kelsier with a look of slight apprehension. Kelsier just\nsmiled more broadly, and finally Dockson rolled his eyes, sighing. Then he\nglanced at Vin. “You haven’t touched your drink.”\nVin shook her head.\nDockson waited for an explanation, and eventually Vin was forced to\nrespond. “I don’t like to drink anything I didn’t prepare myself.”\nKelsier chuckled. “She reminds me of Vent.”\n“Vent?” Dockson said with a snort. “The lass is a bit paranoid, but she’s\nnot that bad. I swear, that man was so jumpy that his own heartbeat could\nstartle him.”\nThe two men shared a laugh. Vin, however, was only made more\nuncomfortable by the friendly air. What do they expect from me? Am I to be\nan apprentice of some sort?\n“Well, then,” Dockson said, “are you going to tell me how you plan on\ngetting yourself some atium?”\nKelsier opened his mouth to respond, but the stairs clattered with the\nsound of someone coming down. Kelsier and Dockson turned; Vin, of\ncourse, had seated herself so she could see both entrances to the room\nwithout having to move.\nVin expected the newcomer to be one of Camon’s crewmembers, sent to\nsee if Kelsier was done with the lair yet. Therefore, she was completely\nsurprised when the door swung open to reveal the surly, gnarled face of the\nman called Clubs.\nKelsier smiled, eyes twinkling.\nHe’s not surprised. Pleased, perhaps, but not surprised.\n“Clubs,” Kelsier said.\nClubs stood in the doorway, giving the three of them an impressively\ndisapproving stare. Finally, he hobbled into the room.

Then he eyed the bottle of wine.\n“Help yourself,” Kelsier said.\nClubs waved for the boy to go fetch him a cup from the bar, then turned\nback to Kelsier. “I had to be sure,” he said. “Never can trust yourself when\na Soother is around—especially one like him.”\n“You’re a Smoker, Clubs,” Kelsier said. “He couldn’t do much to you,\nnot if you didn’t want him to.”\nClubs shrugged. “I don’t like Soothers. It’s not just Allomancy—men like\nthat . . . well, you can’t trust that you aren’t being manipulated when they\nare around. Copper or no copper.”\n“I wouldn’t rely on something like that to get your loyalty,” Kelsier said.\n“So I’ve heard,” Clubs said as the boy poured him a cup of wine. “Had to\nbe sure, though.

Then he looked over at Kelsier. “So,\nthe Pits really did drive you insane, eh?”\n“Completely,” Kelsier said with a straight face.\nClubs smiled, though on his face the expression had a decidedly twisted\nlook. “You mean to go through with this, then? This so-called job of\nyours?”\nKelsier nodded solemnly.\nClubs downed the rest of his wine. “You’ve got yourself a Smoker then.\nNot for the money, though. If you’re really serious about toppling this\ngovernment, then I’m in.”\nKelsier smiled.\n“And don’t smile at me,” Clubs snapped. “I hate that.”\n“I wouldn’t dare.”\n“Well,” Dockson said, pouring himself another drink, “that solves the\nSmoker problem.”\n“Won’t matter much,” Clubs said. “You’re going to fail. I’ve spent my\nlife trying to hide Mistings from the Lord Ruler and his obligators. He gets\nthem all eventually anyway.”\n“Why bother helping us, then?” Dockson asked.\n“Because,” Clubs said, standing. “The Lord’s going to get me sooner or\nlater. At least this way, I’ll be able to spit in his face as I go. Overthrowing\nthe Final Empire . . .” He smiled. “It’s got style. Let’s go, kid. We’ve got to\nget the shop ready for visitors.”\nVin watched them go, Clubs limping out the door, the boy pulling it\nclosed behind them.

The job I’m proposing . . . well, it just isn’t the sort of thing you\nwalk away from—at least, not if you’re a bored old man who’s generally\nannoyed at life. Now, Vin, I assume that your crew owns this entire\nbuilding?”\nVin nodded. “The shop upstairs is a front.”\n“Good,” Kelsier said, checking his pocket watch, then handing it to\nDockson. “Tell your friends that they can have their lair back—the mists are\nprobably already coming out.”\n“And us?” Dockson asked.\nKelsier smiled. “We’re going to the roof. Like I told you, I have to fetch\nsome atium.”\nBy day, Luthadel was a blackened city, scorched by soot and red sunlight. It\nwas hard, distinct, and oppressive.\nAt night, however, the mists came to blur and obscure. High noble keeps\nbecame ghostly, looming silhouettes. Streets seemed to grow more narrow\nin the fog, every thoroughfare becoming a lonely, dangerous alleyway. Even\nnoblemen and thieves were apprehensive about going out at night—it took a\nstrong heart to brave the foreboding, misty silence. The dark city at night\nwas a place for the desperate and the foolhardy; it was a land of swirling\nmystery and strange creatures.\nStrange creatures like me, Kelsier thought. He stood upon the ledge that\nran around the lip of the flat-roofed lair. Shadowed buildings loomed in the\nnight around him, and the mists made everything seem to shift and move in\nthe darkness. Weak lights peeked from the occasional window, but the tiny\nbeads of illumination were huddled, frightened things.\nA cool breeze slipped across the rooftop, shifting the haze, brushing\nagainst Kelsier’s mist-wetted cheek like an exhaled breath. In days past—\nback before everything had gone wrong—he had always sought out a\nrooftop on the evening before a job, wishing to overlook the city. He didn’t\nrealize he was observing his old custom this night until he glanced to the\nside, expecting Mare to be there next to him, as she always had been.\nInstead, he found only the empty air. Lonely. Silent. The mists had\nreplaced her. Poorly.\nHe sighed and turned. Vin and Dockson stood behind him on the rooftop.\nBoth looked apprehensive to be out in the mists, but they dealt with their\nfear. One did not get far in the underworld without learning to stomach the\nmists.\nKelsier had learned to do far more than “stomach” them. He had gone\namong them so often during the last few years that he was beginning to feel\nmore comfortable at night, within the mists’ obscuring embrace, than he did\nat day.\n“Kell,” Dockson said, “do you have to stand on the ledge like that? Our\nplans may be a bit crazy, but I’d rather not have them end with you\nsplattered across the cobblestones down there.”\nKelsier smiled. He still doesn’t think of me as a Mistborn, he thought. It\nwill take some getting used to for all of them.\nYears before, he had become the most infamous crewleader in Luthadel,"

Mare had been a\nTineye, but he and Dockson . . . they had just been regular men. One a half-\nbreed with no powers, the other a runaway plantation skaa. Together, they\nhad brought Great Houses to their knees, stealing brashly from the most\npowerful men in the Final Empire.\nNow Kelsier was more, so much more. Once he had dreamed of\nAllomancy, wishing for a power like Mare’s. She had been dead before he’d\nSnapped, coming to his powers. She would never see what he would do\nwith them.\nBefore, the high nobility had feared him. It had taken a trap set by the\nLord Ruler himself to capture Kelsier. Now . . . the Final Empire itself\nwould shake before he was finished with it.\nHe scanned the city once more, breathing in the mists, then hopped down\noff the ledge and strolled over to join Dockson and Vin. They carried no\nlights; ambient starlight diffused by the mists was enough to see by in most\ncases.\nKelsier took off his jacket and vest, handing them to Dockson, then he\nuntucked his shirt, letting the long garment hang loose. The fabric was dark\nenough that it wouldn’t give him away in the night.\n“All right,” Kelsier said. “Who should I try?”\nDockson frowned. “You’re sure you want to do this?”\nKelsier smiled.\nDockson sighed. “Houses Urbain and Teniert have been hit recently,\nthough not for their atium.”\n“Which house is the strongest right now?” Kelsier asked, squatting down\nand undoing the ties on his pack, which rested by Dockson’s feet. “Who\nwould no one consider hitting?”\nDockson paused. “Venture,” he finally said. “They’ve been on top for the\nlast few years. They keep a standing force of several hundred men, and the\nlocal house nobility includes a good two dozen Mistings.”\nKelsier nodded. “Well, that’s where I’ll go, then. They’re certain to have\nsome atium.” He pulled open the pack, then whipped out a dark gray cloak.\nLarge and enveloping, the cloak wasn’t constructed from a single piece of\ncloth—rather, it was made up of hundreds of long, ribbonlike strips. They\nwere sewn together at the shoulders and across the chest, but mostly they\nhung separate from one another, like overlapping streamers.\nKelsier threw on the garment, its strips of cloth twisting and curling,\nalmost like the mists themselves.\nDockson exhaled softly. “I’ve never been so close to someone wearing\none of those.”\n“What is it?” Vin asked, her quiet voice almost haunting in the night\nmists.\n“A Mistborn cloak,” Dockson said. “They all wear the things—it’s kind\nof like a . . . sign of membership in their club.”\n“It’s colored and constructed to hide you in the mist,” Kelsier said. “And\nit warns city guards and other Mistborn not to bother you.” He spun, letting\nthe cloak flare dramatically. “I think it suits me.”\nDockson rolled his eyes."

Is there anything I need to know?”\n“Lord Venture supposedly has a safe in his study,” Dockson said. “That’s\nwhere he’d probably keep his atium stash. You’ll find the study on the third\nfloor, three rooms in from the upper southern balcony. Be careful, House\nVenture keeps about a dozen hazekillers in addition to its regular troops and\nMistings.”\nKelsier nodded, tying on the belt—it had no buckle, but it did contain\ntwo small sheaths. He pulled a pair of glass daggers from the bag, checked\nthem for nicks, and slid them into the sheaths. He kicked off his shoes and\nstripped off his stockings, leaving himself barefoot on the chill stones. With\nthe shoes also went the last bit of metal on his person save for his coin\npouch and the three vials of metals in his belt. He selected the largest one,\ndowned its contents, then handed the empty vial to Dockson.\n“That it?” Kelsier asked.\nDockson nodded. “Good luck.”\nBeside him, the girl Vin was watching Kelsier’s preparations with intense\ncuriosity. She was a quiet, small thing, but she hid an intensity that he found\nimpressive. She was paranoid, true, but not timid.\nYou’ll get your chance, kid, he thought. Just not tonight.\n“Well,” he said, pulling a coin from his pouch and tossing it off the side\nof the building. “Guess I’ll be going. I’ll meet you back at Clubs’s shop in a\nbit.”\nDockson nodded.\nKelsier turned and walked back up onto the roof’s ledge. Then he jumped\noff the building.\nMist curled in the air around him. He burned steel, second of the basic\nAllomantic metals. Translucent blue lines sprang into existence around him,\nvisible only to his eyes. Each one led from the center of his chest out to a\nnearby source of metal. The lines were all relatively faint—a sign that they\npointed to metal sources that were small: door hinges, nails, and other bits.\nThe type of source metal didn’t matter. Burning iron or steel would point\nblue lines at all kinds of metal, assuming they were close enough and large\nenough to be noticeable.\nKelsier chose the line that pointed directly beneath him, toward his coin.\nBurning steel, he Pushed against the coin.\nHis descent immediately stopped, and he was thrown back up into the air\nin the opposite direction along the blue line. He reached out to the side,\nselected a passing window clasp, and Pushed against it, angling himself to\nthe side. The careful nudge sent him up and over the lip of the building\ndirectly across the street from Vin’s lair.\nKelsier landed with a lithe step, falling into a crouch and running across\nthe building’s peaked roof.

It wasn’t\nthat the night around him grew any lighter; his ability to perceive simply\nincreased. In the distance to the north, he could just barely make out a large\nstructure. Keep Venture.\nKelsier left his tin on—it burned slowly, and he probably didn’t need to\nworry about running out. As he stood, the mists curled slightly around his\nbody. They twisted and spun, running in a slight, barely noticeable current\nbeside him. The mists knew him; they claimed him. They could sense\nAllomancy.\nHe jumped, Pushing against a metal chimney behind him, sending\nhimself in a wide horizontal leap. He tossed a coin even as he jumped, the\ntiny bit of metal flickering through the darkness and fog. He Pushed against\nthe coin before it hit the ground, the force of his weight driving it\ndownward in a sharp motion. As soon as it hit the cobblestones, Kelsier’s\nPushing forced him upward, turning the second half of his leap into a\ngraceful arc.\nKelsier landed on another peaked wooden rooftop. Steel-pushing and\nIronpulling were the first things that Gemmel had taught him. When you\nPush on something, it’s like you’re throwing your weight against it, the old\nlunatic had said. And you can’t change how much you weigh—you’re an\nAllomancer, not some northern mystic. Don’t Pull on something that weighs\nless than you unless you want it to come flying at you, and don’t Push on\nsomething heavier than you unless you want to get tossed in the other\ndirection.\nKelsier scratched his scars, then pulled his mistcloak tight as he crouched\non the roof, the wooden grain biting his unshod toes. He often wished that\nburning tin didn’t enhance all of the senses—or, at least, not all of them at\nonce. He needed the improved eyesight to see in the darkness, and he made\ngood use of the improved hearing as well. However, burning tin made the\nnight seem even more chilly to his overly sensitive skin, and his feet\nregistered every pebble and wooden ripple they touched.\nKeep Venture rose before him. Compared with the murky city, the keep\nseemed to blaze with light. High nobles kept different schedules from\nregular people; the ability to afford, even squander, lamp oil and candles\nmeant that the wealthy didn’t have to bow before the whims of season or\nsun.\nThe keep was majestic—that much was visible simply from the\narchitecture. While it maintained a defensive wall around the grounds, the\nkeep itself was more an artistic construction than a fortification. Sturdy\nbuttressings arched out from the sides, allowing for intricate windows and\ndelicate spires. Brilliant stained-glass windows stretched high along the\nsides of the rectangular building, and they shone with light from within,\ngiving the surrounding mists a variegated glow.\nKelsier burned iron, flaring it strong and searching the night for large\nsources of metal. He was too far away from the keep to use small items like\ncoins or hinges. He’d need a larger anchor to cover this distance.\nMost of the blue lines were faint. Kelsier marked a couple of them"

Kelsier marked a couple of them\nmoving in a slow pattern up ahead—probably a pair of guards standing on\nthe rooftop. Kelsier would be sensing their breastplates and weapons.\nDespite Allomantic considerations, most noblemen still armed their soldiers\nwith metal. Mistings who could Push or Pull metals were uncommon, and\nfull Mistborn were even more so. Many lords thought it impractical to leave\none’s soldiers and guards relatively defenseless in order to counter such a\nsmall segment of the population.\nNo, most high noblemen relied on other means to deal with Allomancers.\nKelsier smiled. Dockson had said that Lord Venture kept a squad of\nhazekillers; if that was true, Kelsier would probably meet them before the\nnight was through. He ignored the soldiers for the moment, instead focusing\non a solid line of blue pointing toward the keep’s lofty top. It likely had\nbronze or copper sheeting on the roof. Kelsier flared his iron, took a deep\nbreath, and Pulled on the line.\nWith a sudden jerk, he was yanked into the air.\nKelsier continued to burn iron, pulling himself toward the keep at a\ntremendous speed. Some rumors claimed that Mistborn could fly, but that\nwas a wistful exaggeration. Pulling and Pushing against metals usually felt\nless like flying than it did like falling—only in the wrong direction. An\nAllomancer had to Pull hard in order to get the proper momentum, and this\nsent him hurtling toward his anchor at daunting speeds.\nKelsier shot toward the keep, mists curling around him. He easily cleared\nthe protective wall surrounding the keep’s grounds, but his body dropped\nslightly toward the ground as he moved. It was his pesky weight again; it\ntugged him down. Even the swiftest of arrows angled slightly toward the\nground as it flew.\nThe drag of his weight meant that instead of shooting right up to the roof,\nhe swung in an arc. He approached the keep wall several dozen feet below\nthe rooftop, still traveling at a terrible speed.\nTaking a deep breath, Kelsier burned pewter, using it to enhance his\nphysical strength much in the same way that tin enhanced his senses. He\nturned himself in the air, hitting the stone wall feet-first. Even his\nstrengthened muscles protested at the treatment, but he stopped without\nbreaking any bones. He immediately released his hold on the roof, dropping\na coin and Pushing against it even as he began to fall. He reached out,\nselecting a source of metal above him—one of the wire housings of a\nstained-glass window—and Pulled on it.\nThe coin hit the ground below and was suddenly able to support his\nweight. Kelsier launched himself upward, Pushing on the coin and Pulling\non the window at the same time. Then, extinguishing both metals, he let\nmomentum carry him the last few feet up through the dark mists. Cloak\nflapping quietly, he crested the lip of the keep’s upper service walkway,\nflipped himself up over the stone railing, and landed quietly on the ledge.\nA startled guard stood not three paces away.

Kelsier was upon the man in\na second, jumping into the air, Pulling slightly on the guard’s steel\nbreastplate and throwing the man off balance. Kelsier whipped out one of\nhis glass daggers, allowing the strength of his Ironpull to bring him toward\nthe guard. He landed with both feet against the man’s chest, then crouched\nand sliced with a pewter-enhanced swing.\nThe guard collapsed with a slit throat. Kelsier landed lithely beside him,\nears straining in the night, listening for sounds of alarm. There were none.\nKelsier left the guard to his gurgling demise. The man was likely a lesser\nnobleman. The enemy. If he were, instead, a skaa soldier—enticed into\nbetraying his people in exchange for a few coins . . . Well, then, Kelsier was\neven happier to send such men into their eternity.\nHe Pushed off the dying man’s breastplate, hopping up off the stone\nservice walkway and onto the rooftop itself. The bronze roof was chill and\nslick beneath his feet. He scurried along it, heading toward the southern\nside of the building, looking for the balcony Dockson had mentioned. He\nwasn’t too worried about being spotted; one purpose of this evening was to\nsteal some atium, the tenth and most powerful of the generally known\nAllomantic metals. His other purpose, however, was to cause a commotion.\nHe found the balcony with ease. Wide and broad, it was probably a\nsitting balcony, used to entertain small groups. It was quiet at the moment,\nhowever—empty save for two guards. Kelsier crouched silently in the night\nmists above the balcony, furled gray cloak obscuring him, toes curling out\nover the side of the roof’s metallic lip. The two guards chatted unwittingly\nbelow.\nTime to make a bit of noise.\nKelsier dropped to the ledge directly between the guards. Burning pewter\nto strengthen his body, he reached out and fiercely Steelpushed against both\nmen at the same time. Braced as he was at the center, his Push threw the\nguards away in opposite directions. The men cried out in surprise as the\nsudden force threw them backward, hurling them over the balcony railing\ninto the darkness beyond.\nThe guards screamed as they fell. Kelsier threw open the balcony doors,\nletting a wall of mist fall inward around him, its tendrils creeping forward\nto claim the darkened room beyond.\nThird room in, Kelsier thought, moving forward in a crouching run. The\nsecond room was a quiet, greenhouse-like conservatory. Low beds\ncontaining cultivated bushes and small trees ran through the room, and one\nwall was made up of enormous floor-to-ceiling windows to provide sunlight\nfor the plants. Though it was dark, Kelsier knew that the plants would all be\nof slightly different colors than the typical brown—some would be white,\nothers ruddy, and perhaps even a few light yellow. Plants that weren’t\nbrown were a rarity cultivated and kept by the nobility.\nKelsier moved quickly through the conservatory. He paused at the next\ndoorway, noting its lighted outline.

He extinguished his tin lest his\nenhanced eyes be blinded when he entered the lit room, and threw open the\ndoor.\nHe ducked inside, blinking against the light, a glass dagger in each hand.\nThe room, however, was empty. It was obviously a study; a lantern burned\non each wall beside bookcases, and it had a desk in the corner.\nKelsier replaced his knives, burning steel and searching for sources of\nmetal. There was a large safe in the corner of the room, but it was too\nobvious. Sure enough, another strong source of metal shone from inside the\neastern wall. Kelsier approached, running his fingers along the plaster. Like\nmany walls in noble keeps, this one was painted with a soft mural. Foreign\ncreatures lounged beneath a red sun. The false section of wall was under\ntwo feet square, and it had been placed so that its cracks were obscured by\nthe mural.\nThere’s always another secret, Kelsier thought. He didn’t bother trying to\nfigure out how to open the contraption. He simply burned steel, reaching in\nand tugging against the weak source of metal that he assumed was the\ntrapdoor’s locking mechanism. It resisted at first, pulling him against the\nwall, but he burned pewter and yanked harder. The lock snapped, and the\npanel swung open, revealing a small safe embedded in the wall.\nKelsier smiled. It looked small enough for a pewter-enhanced man to\ncarry, assuming he could get it out of the wall.\nHe jumped up, Ironpulling against the safe, and landed with his feet\nagainst the wall, one foot on either side of the open panel. He continued to\nPull, holding himself in place, and flared his pewter. Strength flooded his\nlegs, and he flared his steel as well, Pulling against the safe.\nHe strained, grunting slightly at the exertion. It was a test to see which\nwould give out first—the safe, or his legs.\nThe safe shifted in its mountings. Kelsier Pulled harder, muscles\nprotesting. For an extended moment, nothing happened. Then the safe\nshook and ripped free of the wall. Kelsier fell backward, burning steel and\nPushing against the safe to get out of the way. He landed maladroitly, sweat\ndripping from his brow as the safe crashed to the wooden floor, throwing up\nsplinters.\nA pair of startled guards burst into the room.\n“About time,” Kelsier noted, raising a hand and Pulling on one of the\nsoldier’s swords. It whipped out of the sheath, spinning in the air and\nstreaking toward Kelsier point-first. He extinguished his iron, stepping to\nthe side and catching the sword by its hilt as momentum carried it past.\n“Mistborn!” the guard screamed.\nKelsier smiled and jumped forward.\nThe guard pulled out a dagger. Kelsier Pushed it, tearing the weapon out\nof the man’s hand, then swung, shearing the guard’s head from his body.\nThe second guard cursed, tugging free the release tie on his breastplate.\nKelsier Pushed on his own sword even as he completed his swing.

The\nsword ripped from his fingers and hissed directly toward the second guard.\nThe man’s armor dropped free—preventing Kelsier from Pushing against it\n—just as the first guard’s corpse fell to the ground. A moment later,\nKelsier’s sword planted itself in the second guard’s now unarmored chest.\nThe man stumbled quietly, then collapsed.\nKelsier turned from the bodies, cloak rustling. His anger was quiet, not as\nfierce as it had been the night he’d killed Lord Tresting. But he felt it still,\nfelt it in the itching of his scars and in the remembered screams of the\nwoman he loved. As far as Kelsier was concerned, any man who upheld the\nFinal Empire also forfeited his right to live.\nHe flared his pewter, strengthening his body, then squatted down and\nlifted the safe. He teetered for a second beneath its weight, then got his\nbalance and began to shuffle back toward the balcony. Perhaps the safe held\natium; perhaps it didn’t. However, he didn’t have time to search out other\noptions.\nHe was halfway through the conservatory when he heard footsteps from\nbehind. He turned to see the study flooding with figures. There were eight\nof them, each one wearing a loose gray robe and carrying a dueling cane\nand a shield instead of a sword. Hazekillers.\nKelsier let the safe drop to the ground. Hazekillers weren’t Allomancers,\nbut they were trained to fight Mistings and Mistborn. There wouldn’t be a\nsingle bit of metal on their bodies, and they would be ready for his tricks.\nKelsier stepped back, stretching and smiling. The eight men fanned into\nthe study, moving with quiet precision.\nThis should be interesting.\nThe hazekillers attacked, dashing by twos into the conservatory. Kelsier\npulled out his daggers, ducking beneath the first attack and slicing at a\nman’s chest. The hazekiller jumped back, however, and forced Kelsier away\nwith a swing of his cane.\nKelsier flared his pewter, letting strengthened legs carry him back in a\npowerful jump. With one hand, he whipped out a handful of coins and\nPushed them against his opponents. The metal disks shot forward, zipping\nthrough the air, but his enemies were ready for this: They raised their\nshields, and the coins bounced off the wood, throwing up splinters but\nleaving the men unharmed.\nKelsier eyed the other hazekillers as they filled the room, advancing on\nhim. They couldn’t hope to fight him in an extended battle—their tactic\nwould be to rush him at once, hoping for a quick end to the fight, or to at\nleast stall him until Allomancers could be awakened and brought to fight.\nHe glanced at the safe as he landed.\nHe couldn’t leave without it. He needed to end the fight quickly as well.\nFlaring pewter, he jumped forward, trying an experimental dagger swipe,\nbut he couldn’t get inside his opponent’s defenses. Kelsier barely ducked\naway in time to avoid getting cracked on the head by the end of a cane."

Kelsier barely ducked\naway in time to avoid getting cracked on the head by the end of a cane.\nThree of the hazekillers dashed behind him, cutting off his retreat into the\nbalcony room. Great, Kelsier thought, trying to keep an eye on all eight\nmen at once. They advanced on him with careful precision, working as a\nteam.\nGritting his teeth, Kelsier flared his pewter again; it was running low, he\nnoticed. Pewter was the fastest-burning of the basic eight metals.\nNo time to worry about that now. The men behind him attacked, and\nKelsier jumped out of the way—Pulling on the safe to tug himself toward\nthe center of the room. He Pushed as soon as he hit the ground near the\nsafe, launching himself into the air at an angle. He tucked, flipping over the\nheads of two attackers, and landed on the ground beside a well-cultivated\ntree bed. He spun, flaring his pewter and raising his arm in defense against\nthe swing he knew would come.\nThe dueling cane connected with his arm. A burst of pain ran down his\nforearm, but his pewter-enhanced bone held. Kelsier kept moving, driving\nhis other hand forward and slamming a dagger into his opponent’s chest.\nThe man stumbled back in surprise, the motion ripping away Kelsier’s\ndagger. A second hazekiller attacked, but Kelsier ducked, then reached\ndown with his free hand, ripping his coin pouch off of his belt. The\nhazekiller prepared to block Kelsier’s remaining dagger, but Kelsier raised\nhis other hand instead, slamming the coin pouch into the man’s shield.\nThen he Pushed on the coins inside.\nThe hazekiller cried out, the force of the intense Steelpush throwing him\nbackward. Kelsier flared his steel, Pushing so hard that he tossed himself\nbackward as well—away from the pair of men who tried to attack him.\nKelsier and his enemy flew away from each other, hurled in opposite\ndirections. Kelsier collided with the far wall, but kept Pushing, smashing\nhis opponent—pouch, shield, and all—against one of the massive\nconservatory windows.\nGlass shattered, sparkles of lanternlight from the study playing across its\nshards. The hazekiller’s desperate face disappeared into the darkness\nbeyond, and mist—quiet, yet ominous—began to creep in through the\nshattered window.\nThe other six men advanced relentlessly, and Kelsier was forced to\nignore the pain in his arm as he ducked two swings. He spun out of the way,\nbrushing past a small tree, but a third hazekiller attacked, smashing his cane\ninto Kelsier’s side.\nThe attack threw Kelsier into the tree bed. He tripped, then collapsed\nnear the entrance to the lit study, dropping his dagger. He gasped in pain,\nrolling to his knees and holding his side. The blow would have broken\nanother man’s ribs. Even Kelsier would have a massive bruise.\nThe six men moved forward, spreading to surround him again. Kelsier\nstumbled to his feet, vision growing dizzy from pain and exertion.

The light nearly blinded him, and the pain in his arm and\nside suddenly seemed more acute, but the burst of enhanced senses cleared\nhis head.\nThe six hazekillers advanced in a sudden, coordinated attack.\nKelsier whipped his hand to the side, burning iron and searching for\nmetal. The closest source was a thick silvery paperweight on a desk just\ninside the study. Kelsier flipped it into his hand, then turned, arm held\ntoward the advancing men, falling into an offensive stance.\n“All right,” he growled.\nKelsier burned steel with a flash of strength. The rectangular ingot ripped\nfrom his hand, streaking through the air. The foremost hazekiller raised his\nshield, but he moved too slowly. The ingot hit the man’s shoulder with a\ncrunch, and he dropped, crying out.\nKelsier spun to the side, ducking a staff swing and putting a hazekiller\nbetween himself and the fallen man. He burned iron, Pulling the ingot back\ntoward him. It whipped through the air, cracking the second hazekiller in\nthe side of the head. The man collapsed as the ingot flipped into the air.\nOne of the remaining men cursed, rushing forward to attack. Kelsier\nPushed the still airborne ingot, flipping it away from him—and away from\nthe attacking hazekiller, who had his shield raised. Kelsier heard the ingot\nhit the ground behind him, and he reached up—burning pewter—and\ncaught the hazekiller’s cane mid-swing.\nThe hazekiller grunted, struggling against Kelsier’s enhanced strength.\nKelsier didn’t bother trying to pull the weapon free; instead he Pulled\nsharply on the ingot behind him, bringing it toward his own back at a\ndeadly speed. He twisted at the last moment, using his momentum to spin\nthe hazekiller around—right into the ingot’s path.\nThe man dropped.\nKelsier flared pewter, steadying himself against attacks. Sure enough, a\ncane smashed against his shoulders. He stumbled to his knees as the wood\ncracked, but flared tin kept him conscious. Pain and lucidity flashed through\nhis mind. He Pulled on the ingot—ripping it out of the dying man’s back—\nand stepped to the side, letting the impromptu weapon shoot past him.\nThe two hazekillers nearest him crouched warily. The ingot snapped into\none of the men’s shields, but Kelsier didn’t continue Pushing, lest he throw\nhimself off balance. Instead, he burned iron, wrenching the ingot back\ntoward himself. He ducked, extinguishing iron and feeling the ingot whoosh\nthrough the air above him. There was a crack as it collided with the man\nwho had been sneaking up on him.\nKelsier spun, burning iron then steel to send the ingot soaring toward the\nfinal two men.

The ingot flipped a few times in the darkness,\nand Kelsier snatched it from the air, its cool surface slick with blood. Mist\nfrom the shattered window flowed by his feet, curling up around his legs.\nHe brought his hand down, pointing it directly at the last remaining\nhazekiller.\nSomewhere in the room, a fallen man groaned.\nThe remaining hazekiller stepped back, then dropped his weapon and\ndashed away. Kelsier smiled, lowering his hand.\nSuddenly, the ingot was Pushed from his fingers. It shot across the room,\nsmashing through another window. Kelsier cursed, spinning to see another,\nlarger group of men pouring into the study. They wore the clothing of\nnoblemen. Allomancers.\nSeveral of them raised hands, and a flurry of coins shot toward Kelsier.\nHe flared steel, Pushing the coins out of the way.

Several burly men ran forward in a crouch, staying beneath the\nshooting coins. Thugs—Mistings who, like Ham, could burn pewter.\nTime to go, Kelsier thought, deflecting another wave of coins, gritting his\nteeth against the pain in his side and arm. He glanced behind him; he had a\nfew moments, but he was never going to make it back to the balcony. As\nmore Mistings advanced, Kelsier took a deep breath and dashed toward one\nof the broken, floor-to-ceiling windows.

Inside the safe, he found a small pouch of gemstones and a\ncouple of ten-thousand boxing letters of credit, all of which he pocketed.

Perhaps another might have found the room\ncramped and spartan, but to Vin it seemed lavish.\nShe sat up, frowning. It felt wrong to have a room all to herself. She had\nalways been crammed into tight bunkrooms filled with crewmembers. Even\nwhile traveling, she had slept in beggars’ alleys or rebel caves, and Reen\nhad been there with her. She had always been forced to fight to find privacy.\nBeing given it so easily seemed to devalue the years she had spent relishing\nher brief moments of solitude.\nShe slipped out of bed, not bothering to open the shutters. The sunlight\nwas faint, which meant it was still early morning, but she could already hear\npeople moving in the hallway. She crept to the door, creaking it open and\npeeking out.\nAfter leaving Kelsier the night before, Dockson had led Vin to Clubs’s\nshop. Because of the late hour, Clubs had immediately led them to their\nseparate rooms. Vin, however, had not gone to bed immediately. She had\nwaited until everyone was asleep, then had snuck out to inspect her\nsurroundings.\nThe residence was almost more of an inn than it was a shop. Though it\nhad a showroom below and a large workshop in the back, the building’s\nsecond floor was dominated by several long hallways lined with\nguestrooms. There was a third floor, and the doors were more widely spaced\nthere, implying larger rooms. She hadn’t tapped for trapdoors or false walls\n—the noise might have awakened someone—but experience told her that it\nwouldn’t be a proper lair if it didn’t have at least a secret basement and\nsome bolt-holes.\nOverall, she was impressed. The carpentry equipment and half-finished\nprojects below indicated a reputable, working front. The lair was secure,\nwell stocked, and well maintained. Watching through the crack in her door,\nVin made out a group of about six groggy young men coming out of the\nhallway opposite her own. They wore simple clothing, and made their way\ndown the stairs toward the workroom.\nApprentice carpenters, Vin thought. That’s Clubs’s front—he’s a skaa\ncraftsman. Most skaa lived lives of drudgery on the plantations; even those\nwho lived in a city were generally forced to do menial labor. However,\nsome talented few were allowed a trade. They were still skaa; they were\npaid poorly and were always subject to the whims of the nobility. However,\nthey had a measure of freedom that most skaa would envy.\nClubs was probably a master carpenter. What would entice such a man—\none who had, by skaa standards, an amazing life—to risk joining the\nunderground?\nHe is a Misting, Vin thought. Kelsier and Dockson called him a\n“Smoker.” She would probably have to figure out what that meant on her\nown; experience told her that a powerful man like Kelsier would withhold\nknowledge from her as long as he could, stringing her along with occasional\ntidbits. His knowledge was what bound her to him—it would be unwise to\ngive away too much too quickly."

His knowledge was what bound her to him—it would be unwise to\ngive away too much too quickly.\nFootsteps sounded outside, and Vin continued to peek through the crack.\n“You’ll want to get ready, Vin,” Dockson said as he passed her door. He\nwore a nobleman’s dress shirt and slacks, and he already looked awake and\ntrim. He paused, continuing. “There’s a fresh bath for you in the room at the\nend of the hallway, and I had Clubs scrounge you up a few changes of\nclothing. They should fit well enough until we can get you something more\nappropriate. Take your time in the bath—Kell’s planned a meeting for this\nafternoon, but we can’t start until Breeze and Ham arrive.”\nDockson smiled, eyeing her through the cracked door, then continued on\ndown the hallway. Vin flushed at being caught. These are observant men.\nI’m going to have to remember that.\nThe hallway grew quiet. She slipped out her door and crept down to the\nindicated room, and was half surprised to find that there was indeed a warm\nbath waiting for her. She frowned, studying the tiled chamber and metal tub.\nThe water smelled scented, after the fashion of noble ladies.\nThese men are more like noblemen than skaa, Vin thought. She wasn’t\ncertain what she thought of that. However, they obviously expected her to\ndo as they did, so she closed and bolted the door, then disrobed and crawled\ninto the tub.\nShe smelled funny.\nEven though the scent was faint, Vin still caught whiffs of herself\noccasionally. It was the smell of a passing noblewoman, the scent of a\nperfumed drawer opened by her brother’s burgling fingers. The smell grew\nless noticeable as the morning progressed, but it still worried her. It would\ndistinguish her from other skaa. If this crew expected her to take those baths\nregularly, she would have to request that the perfumes be removed.\nThe morning meal was more up to her expectations. Several skaa women\nof various ages worked the shop’s kitchen, preparing baywraps—rolls of\nthin, flat bread stuffed with boiled barley and vegetables. Vin stood by the\nkitchen doorway, watching the women work. None of them smelled like she\ndid, though they were far more cleanly and well groomed than average\nskaa.\nIn fact, there was an odd sense of cleanliness to the entire building. She\nhadn’t noticed it the night before, because of the darkness, but the floor was\nscrubbed clean. All of the workers—kitchen women or apprentices—had\nclean faces and hands. It felt odd to Vin. She was accustomed to her own\nfingers being black with ashstains; with Reen, if she’d ever washed her\nface, she had quickly rubbed it with ash again. A clean face stood out on the\nstreets.\nNo ash in the corners, she thought, eyeing the floor. The room is kept\nswept. She’d never lived in such a place before.

By\nReen’s command, Vin had lived so that other crewmembers would think of\nher as a thief first and a girl second.\nBut, what am I now? Perfumed by her bath, yet wearing the tan trousers\nand buttoning shirt of an apprentice craftsman, she felt distinctly out of\nplace. And that was bad—if she felt awkward, then she undoubtedly looked\nawkward too. Something else to make her stand out.\nVin turned, eyeing the workroom. The apprentices were already about\ntheir morning labors, working on various bits of furniture. They stayed in\nthe back while Clubs worked in the main showroom, putting detailed\nfinishing touches on the pieces.\nThe back kitchen door suddenly slammed open. Vin slipped reflexively to\nthe side, putting her back to a wall and peeking around into the kitchen.\nHam stood in the kitchen doorway, framed by red sunlight. He wore a\nloose shirt and vest, both sleeveless, and carried several large packs. He\nwasn’t dirtied by soot—none of the crew had ever been, the few times Vin\nhad seen them.\nHam walked through the kitchen and into the workroom. “So,” he said,\ndropping his packs, “anyone know which room is mine?”\n“I’ll ask Master Cladent,” one of the apprentices said, moving into the\nfront room.\nHam smiled, stretching, then turned toward Vin. “Morning, Vin. You\nknow, you don’t have to hide from me. We’re on the same team.”\nVin relaxed but remained where she was, standing beside a line of mostly\nfinished chairs. “You’re going to live here too?”\n“It always pays to stay near the Smoker,” Ham said, turning and\ndisappearing back into the kitchen. He returned a moment later with a stack\nof four large baywraps. “Anyone know where Kell is?”\n“Sleeping,” Vin said. “He came in late last night, and hasn’t gotten up\nyet.”\nHam grunted, taking a bite of a baywrap. “Dox?”\n“In his room on the third floor,” Vin said. “He got up early, came down to\nget something to eat, and went back upstairs.” She didn’t add that she knew,\nfrom peeking through the keyhole, that he was sitting at his desk scribbling\non some papers.\nHam raised an eyebrow. “You always keep track of where everyone is\nlike that?”\n“Yes.”\nHam paused, then chuckled. “You’re an odd kid, Vin.” He gathered up\nhis packs as the apprentice returned, and the two moved up the stairs. Vin\nstood, listening to their footsteps. They stopped about halfway down the\nfirst hallway, perhaps a few doors from her room.\nThe scent of steamed barley enticed her. Vin eyed the kitchen. Ham had\ngone in and taken food. Was she allowed to do the same?\nTrying to look confident, Vin strode into the kitchen. A pile of baywraps"

A pile of baywraps\nsat on a platter, probably to be delivered to the apprentices as they worked.\nVin picked up two of them. None of the women objected; in fact, a few of\nthem even nodded respectfully toward her.\nI’m an important person now, she thought with a measure of discomfort.\nDid they know that she was . . . Mistborn? Or was she simply treated with\nrespect because she was a guest?\nEventually, Vin took a third baywrap and fled to her room. It was more\nfood than she could possibly eat; however, she intended to scrape out the\nbarley and save the flatbread, which would keep well should she need it\nlater.\nA knock came at her door. Vin answered it, pulling the door open with a\ncareful motion. A young man stood outside—the boy who had been with\nClubs back at Camon’s lair the night before.\nThin, tall, and awkward-looking, he was dressed in gray clothing. He was\nperhaps fourteen, though his height might have made him look older than\nhe was. He seemed nervous for some reason.\n“Yes?” Vin asked.\n“Um . . .”\nVin frowned. “What?”\n“You’re wanted,” he said in a thick Eastern accent. “Ups in the where\nabove with the doing. With Master Jumps to the third floor. Uh, I’ve gotta\ngo.” The boy blushed, then turned and hurried away, scrambling up the\nstairs.\nVin stood in the doorway of her room, dumbfounded. Was that supposed\nto make any sense? she wondered.\nShe peeked into the hallway. The boy had seemed like he expected her to\nfollow him. Finally, she decided to do so, carefully making her way up the\nsteps.\nVoices were coming from an open door at the end of the hallway. Vin\napproached and peeked around the corner to find a well-decorated room, set\nwith a fine rug and comfortable-looking chairs. A hearth burned at the side\nof the room, and the chairs were arranged to point toward a large charcoal\nwriting board set atop an easel.\nKelsier stood, leaning one elbow resting against the brick hearth, a cup of\nwine in his hand. Angling herself slightly, Vin could see that he was talking\nto Breeze. The Soother had arrived well into midday, and had appropriated\nhalf of Clubs’s apprentices to unload his possessions. Vin had watched from\nher window as the apprentices had carried the luggage—disguised as boxes\nof lumber scraps—up to Breeze’s room. Breeze himself hadn’t bothered to\nhelp.\nHam was there, as was Dockson, and Clubs was settling himself into the\nlarge, overstuffed chair farthest from Breeze. The boy who had fetched Vin\nsat on a stool beside Clubs, and he was obviously making a point of trying\nnot to look at her. The final occupied chair held the man Yeden, dressed—as\nbefore—in common skaa worker’s clothing. He sat in his chair without\nresting against its back, as if he disapproved of its plushness. His face was\ndarkened with soot, as Vin expected of a skaa worker.\nThere were two empty chairs. Kelsier noticed Vin standing by the"

Kelsier noticed Vin standing by the\ndoorway, and gave her one of his inviting smiles. “Well, there she is. Come\nin.”\nVin scanned the room. There was a window, though its shutters were\nclosed against approaching gloom. The only chairs were the ones in\nKelsier’s half circle. Resigned, she moved forward and took the empty chair\nbeside Dockson. It was too big for her, and she settled into it with her knees\nfolded beneath her.\n“That’s all of us,” Kelsier said.\n“Who’s the last chair for?” Ham asked.\nKelsier smiled, winked, but ignored the question. “All right, let’s talk.\nWe’ve got something of a task ahead of ourselves, and the sooner we begin\noutlining a plan, the better.”\n“I thought you had a plan,” Yeden said uncomfortably.\n“I have a framework,” Kelsier said. “I know what needs to happen, and I\nhave a few ideas on how to do it. But, you don’t gather a group like this and\njust tell them what to do. We need to work this out together, beginning with\na list of problems we need to deal with if we want the plan to work.”\n“Well,” Ham said, “let me get the framework straight first. The plan is to\ngather Yeden an army, cause chaos in Luthadel, secure the palace, steal the\nLord Ruler’s atium, then leave the government to collapse?”\n“Essentially,” Kelsier said.\n“Then,” Ham said, “our main problem is the Garrison. If we want chaos\nin Luthadel, then we can’t have twenty thousand troops here to keep the\npeace. Not to mention the fact that Yeden’s troops will never take the city\nwhile there is any sort of armed resistance on the walls.”\nKelsier nodded. Picking up a piece of chalk, he wrote Luthadel Garrison\nup on the board. “What else?”\n“We’ll need a way to make said chaos in Luthadel,” Breeze said,\ngesturing with a cup of wine. “Your instincts are right, my dear man. This\ncity is where the Ministry makes its headquarters and the Great Houses run\ntheir mercantile empires. We’ll need to bring Luthadel down if we want to\nbreak the Lord Ruler’s ability to govern.”\n“Mentioning the nobility brings up another point,” Dockson added. “The\nGreat Houses all have guard forces in the city, not to mention their\nAllomancers. If we’re going to deliver the city to Yeden, we’ll have to deal\nwith those noblemen.”\nKelsier nodded, writing Chaos and Great Houses beside Luthadel\nGarrison on his board.\n“The Ministry,” Clubs said, leaning back in his plush chair so much that\nVin almost couldn’t see his grumpy face. “There’ll be no change in\ngovernment as long as the Steel Inquisitors have anything to say about it.”\nKelsier added Ministry to the board. “What else?”\n“Atium,” Ham said. “You might as well write it up there—we’ll need to\nsecure the palace quickly, once general mayhem starts, and make certain\nnobody else takes the opportunity to slip into the treasury.”"

Then he stepped back, looking over the list. “When you break it\ndown like that, it doesn’t sound so bad, does it?”\nVin frowned, trying to decide if Kelsier was attempting a joke or not. The\nlist wasn’t just daunting—it was disturbing. Twenty thousand imperial\nsoldiers? The collected forces and power of the high nobility? The\nMinistry? One Steel Inquisitor was said to be more powerful than a\nthousand troops.\nMore discomforting, however, was how matter-of-factly they regarded\nthe issues. How could they even think of resisting the Lord Ruler? He was .\n. . well, he was the Lord. He ruled all of the world. He was the creator,\nprotector, and punisher of mankind. He had saved them from the Deepness,\nthen had brought the ash and the mists as a punishment for the people’s lack\nof faith. Vin wasn’t particularly religious—intelligent thieves knew to avoid\nthe Steel Ministry—but even she knew the legends.\nAnd yet, the group regarded their list of “problems” with determination.\nThere was a grim mirth about them—as if they understood that they had a\nbetter chance of making the sun rise at night than they did of overthrowing\nthe Final Empire. Yet, they were still going to try.\n“By the Lord Ruler,” Vin whispered. “You’re serious. You really mean to\ndo this.”\n“Don’t use his name as an oath, Vin,” Kelsier said. “Even blasphemy\nhonors him—when you curse by that creature’s name, you acknowledge\nhim as your god.”\nVin fell silent, sitting back in her chair, a bit numb.\n“Anyway,” Kelsier said, smiling lightly. “Anyone have any ideas on how\nto overcome these problems? Besides Yeden’s attitude, of course—we all\nknow he’s hopeless.”\nThe room was quiet and thoughtful."

Besides Yeden’s attitude, of course—we all\nknow he’s hopeless.”\nThe room was quiet and thoughtful.\n“Thoughts?” Kelsier asked. “Angles? Impressions?”\nBreeze shook his head. “Now that it’s all up there, I can’t help wondering\nif the child has a point. This is a daunting task.”\n“But it can be done,” Kelsier said. “Let’s start by talking about how to\nbreak the city. What can we do that would be so threatening that it would\nthrow the nobility into chaos, maybe even get the palace guard out into the\ncity, exposing them to our troops? Something that would distract the\nMinistry, and the Lord Ruler himself, while we move our troops in to\nattack?”\n“Well, a general revolution among the populace comes to mind,” Ham\nsaid.\n“Won’t work,” Yeden said firmly.\n“Why not?” Ham asked. “You know how the people are treated. They\nlive in slums, work in mills and smithies the entire day, and half of them\nstill starve.”\nYeden shook his head. “Don’t you understand? The rebellion has been\ntrying for a thousand years to get the skaa in this city to rise up. It never\nworks. They’re too beaten down—they don’t have the will or the hope to\nresist. That’s why I had to come to you to get an army.”\nThe room fell still. Vin, however, slowly nodded her head. She’d seen it\n—she’d felt it. One didn’t fight the Lord Ruler. Even living as a thief,\ncrouching at the edge of society, she knew that. There would be no\nrebellion.\n“He’s right, I’m afraid,” Kelsier said. “The skaa won’t rise up, not in\ntheir current state. If we’re going to overthrow this government, we’ll need\nto do it without the help of the masses. We can probably recruit our soldiers\nfrom among them, but we can’t count on the general populace.”\n“Could we cause a disaster of some sort?” Ham asked. “A fire maybe?”\nKelsier shook his head. “It might disrupt trade for a while, but I doubt it\nwould have the effect we want. Besides, the cost in skaa lives would be too\nhigh. The slums would burn, not stone nobleman keeps.”\nBreeze sighed. “What, then, would you have us do?”\nKelsier smiled, eyes twinkling. “What if we turned the Great Houses\nagainst each other?”\nBreeze paused. “A house war . . .” he said, taking a speculative sip of his\nwine. “It’s been a while since the city had one of those.”\n“Which means that tensions have had plenty of time to brew,” Kelsier\nsaid. “The high nobility are growing increasingly powerful—the Lord Ruler\nbarely has control over them anymore, which is why we have a chance of\nshattering his grip. Luthadel’s Great Houses are the key—they control\nimperial trade, not to mention enslave the greatest majority of the skaa.”\nKelsier pointed at the board, moving his finger between the line that said\nChaos and the line that said Great Houses."

Mistborn will start assassinating house leaders.\nFortunes will collapse. It won’t take long before there is open warfare in the\nstreets. Part of our contract with Yeden states that we’ll give him an opening\nto seize the city for himself. Can you think of a better one than that?”\nBreeze nodded with a smile. “It has flair—and I do like the idea of\nhaving the noblemen kill each other.”\n“You always like it better when someone else does the work, Breeze,”\nHam noted.\n“My dear friend,” Breeze replied, “the entire point of life is to find ways\nto get others to do your work for you. Don’t you know anything about basic\neconomics?”\nHam raised an eyebrow. “Actually, I—”\n“It was a rhetorical question, Ham,” Breeze interrupted, rolling his eyes.\n“Those are the best kind!” Ham replied.\n“Philosophy later, Ham,” Kelsier said. “Stay on task. What do you think\nof my suggestion?”\n“It could work,” Ham said, settling back. “But I can’t see the Lord Ruler\nletting things go that far.”\n“It’s our job to see that he doesn’t have a choice,” Kelsier said. “He’s\nknown to let his nobility squabble, probably to keep them off-balance. We\nfan those tensions, then we somehow force the Garrison to pull out. When\nthe houses start fighting in earnest, the Lord Ruler won’t be able to do\nanything to stop them—except, perhaps, send his palace guard into the\nstreets, which is exactly what we want him to do.”\n“He could also send for a koloss army,” Ham noted.\n“True,” Kelsier said. “But they’re stationed a moderate distance away.\nThat’s a flaw we need to exploit. Koloss troops make wonderful grunts, but\nthey have to be kept away from civilized cities. The very center of the Final\nEmpire is exposed, yet the Lord Ruler is confident in his strength—and why\nshouldn’t he be? He hasn’t faced a serious threat in centuries. Most cities\nonly need small policing forces.”\n“Twenty thousand men is hardly a ‘small’ number,” Breeze said.\n“It is on a national scale,” Kelsier said, holding up a finger. “The Lord\nRuler keeps most of his troops on the edges of his empire, where the threat\nof rebellion is strongest. That’s why we’re going to strike him here, in\nLuthadel itself—and that’s why we’re going to succeed.”\n“Assuming we can deal with that Garrison,” Dockson noted.\nKelsier nodded, turning to write House War underneath Great Houses\nand Chaos. “All right, then. Let’s talk about the Garrison. What are we\ngoing to do about it?”\n“Well,” Ham said speculatively, “historically, the best way to deal with a\nlarge force of soldiers is to have your own large force of soldiers.

Isn’t\nthat kind of the point of raising the army in the first place?”\n“That won’t work, Hammond,” Breeze said. He regarded his empty cup\nof wine, then held it up toward the boy sitting beside Clubs, who\nimmediately scurried over to refill it.\n“If we wanted to defeat the Garrison,” Breeze continued, “we’d need our\nown force of at least its same size. We’d probably want one much larger,\nsince our men will be newly trained. We might be able to raise Yeden an\narmy—we might even be able to get him one large enough to hold the city\nfor a while. But, getting him one large enough to take on the Garrison inside\nits fortifications? We might as well give up now, if that’s our plan.”\nThe group fell silent. Vin squirmed in her chair, looking over each man in\nturn. Breeze’s words had a profound effect. Ham opened his mouth to\nspeak, then closed it again, sitting back to reconsider.\n“All right,” Kelsier finally said. “We’ll get back to the Garrison in a\nmoment. Let’s look at our own army. How can we raise one of substantial\nsize and hide it from the Lord Ruler?”\n“Again, that will be difficult,” Breeze said. “There is a very good reason\nwhy the Lord Ruler feels safe in the Central Dominance. There are constant\npatrols on the roadways and canals, and you can hardly spend a day\ntraveling without running into a village or plantation. This isn’t the sort of\nplace where you can raise an army without attracting notice.”\n“The rebellion has those caves up to the north,” Dockson said. “We might\nbe able to hide some men there.”\nYeden paled. “You know about the Arguois caverns?”\nKelsier rolled his eyes. “Even the Lord Ruler knows about them, Yeden.\nThe rebels there just aren’t dangerous enough to bother him yet.”\n“How many people do you have, Yeden?” Ham asked. “In Luthadel and\naround it, caves included? What do we have to start with?”\nYeden shrugged. “Maybe three hundred—including women and\nchildren.”\n“And how many do you think those caves could hide?” Ham asked.\nYeden shrugged again.\n“The caves could support a larger group, for certain,” Kelsier said.\n“Perhaps ten thousand. I’ve been there—the rebellion has been hiding\npeople in them for years, and the Lord Ruler has never bothered to destroy\nthem.”\n“I can imagine why,” Ham said. “Cave fighting is nasty business,\nespecially for the aggressor. The Lord Ruler likes to keep defeats to a\nminimum—he’s nothing if not vain. Anyway, ten thousand. That’s a decent\nnumber. It could hold the palace with ease—might even be able to hold the\ncity, if it had the walls.”\nDockson turned to Yeden. “When you asked for an army, what size were\nyou thinking?”\n“Ten thousand sounds like a good number, I suppose,” Yeden said.\n“Actually . . . it’s a bit larger than I was thinking.”\nBreeze tipped his cup slightly, swirling the wine. “I hate to sound"

Ten thousand men. That won’t even frighten the\nGarrison. We’re talking about twenty thousand well-armed, well-trained\ntroops.”\n“He has a point, Kell,” Dockson said. He had found a small book\nsomewhere, and had begun taking notes on the meeting.\nKelsier frowned.\nHam nodded. “Any way you look at it, Kell, that Garrison is going to be\na tough stone to break. Perhaps we should just focus on the nobility. Maybe\nwe can cause enough chaos that even the Garrison won’t be able to suppress\nit.”\nKelsier shook his head. “Doubtful. The Garrison’s primary duty is to\nmaintain order in the city. If we can’t deal with those troops, we’ll never\npull this off.” He paused, then eyed Vin. “What do you think, Vin? Any\nsuggestions?”\nShe froze. Camon had never asked her opinion. What did Kelsier want\nfrom her? She pulled back into her chair slightly as she realized that the\nother members of the crew had turned, looking at her.\n“I . . .” Vin said slowly.\n“Oh, don’t intimidate the poor thing, Kelsier,” Breeze said with a wave of\nhis hand.\nVin nodded, but Kelsier didn’t turn away from her. “No, really. Tell me\nwhat you’re thinking, Vin. You’ve got a much larger enemy threatening\nyou. What do you do?”\n“Well,” she said slowly. “You don’t fight him, that’s for certain. Even if\nyou won somehow, you’d be so hurt and broken that you couldn’t fight off\nanyone else.”\n“Makes sense,” Dockson said. “But we might not have a choice. We have\nto get rid of that army somehow.”\n“And if it just left the city?” she asked. “That would work too? If I had to\ndeal with someone big, I’d try and distract him first, get him to leave me\nalone.”\nHam chuckled. “Good luck getting the Garrison to leave Luthadel. The\nLord Ruler sends squads out on patrol sometimes, but the only time I know\nof the entire Garrison leaving was when that skaa rebellion broke out down\nin Courteline a half century ago.”\nDockson shook his head. “Vin’s idea is too good to dismiss that easily, I\nthink. Really, we can’t fight the Garrison—at least, not while they’re\nentrenched. So, we need to get them to leave the city somehow.”\n“Yes,” Breeze said, “but it would take a particular crisis to require\ninvolving the Garrison. If the problem weren’t threatening enough, the Lord\nRuler wouldn’t send the entire Garrison. If it were too dangerous, he’d\nhunker down and send for his koloss.”\n“A rebellion in one of the nearby cities?” Ham suggested.\n“That leaves us with the same problem as before,” Kelsier said, shaking\nhis head. “If we can’t get the skaa here to rebel, we’ll never get ones outside\nthe city to do so.”"

If they pretend to\nattack someplace nearby, perhaps the Lord Ruler would send the Garrison\nout to help.”\n“I doubt he’d send them away to protect another city,” Breeze said. “Not\nif it left him exposed in Luthadel.”\nThe group fell silent, thinking again. Vin glanced around, then found\nKelsier’s eyes on her.\n“What?” he asked.\nShe squirmed a bit, glancing down. “How far away are the Pits of\nHathsin?” she finally asked.\nThe crew paused.\nFinally, Breeze laughed. “Oh, now that’s devious. The nobility don’t\nknow that the Pits produce atium, so the Lord Ruler couldn’t make much of\na fuss—not without revealing that there’s something very special about\nthose Pits. That means no koloss.”\n“They wouldn’t arrive in time anyway,” Ham said. “The Pits are only a\ncouple of days away. If they were threatened, the Lord Ruler would have to\nrespond quickly. The Garrison would be the only force in striking distance.”\nKelsier smiled, eyes alight. “And it wouldn’t take much of an army to\nthreaten the Pits, either. A thousand men could do it. We send them to\nattack, then when the Garrison leaves, we march our second, larger force in\nand seize Luthadel itself. By the time the Garrison realized that they’d been\nduped, they wouldn’t be able to get back in time to stop us from taking the\ncity walls.”\n“Could we keep them, though?” Yeden asked apprehensively.\nHam nodded eagerly. “With ten thousand skaa, I could hold this city\nagainst the Garrison. The Lord Ruler would have to send for his koloss.”\n“By then, we’d have the atium,” Kelsier said. “And the Great Houses\nwon’t be in any position to stop us—they’ll be weakened and frail because\nof their internal fighting.”\nDockson was scribbling furiously on his pad. “We’ll need to use Yeden’s\ncaves, then. They’re within striking distance of both our targets, and they’re\ncloser to Luthadel than the Pits are. If our army left from there, it could get\nhere before the Garrison could return from the Pits.”\nKelsier nodded.\nDockson continued to scribble. “I’ll have to start stockpiling supplies in\nthose caves, maybe make a trip out to check conditions there.”\n“And, how are we going to get the soldiers there?” Yeden asked. “That’s\na week outside the city—and skaa aren’t allowed to travel on their own.”\n“I’ve already got someone who can help us there,” Kelsier said, writing\nAttack Pits of Hathsin beneath Luthadel Garrison on his board. “I have a\nfriend that can give us a front to run canal boats to the north.”\n“Assuming,” Yeden said, “you can even make good on your first and"

I paid you to gather me an army. Ten thousand men is a\ngreat number, but I’ve still to see an adequate explanation of how you’re\ngoing to raise them. I’ve already told you the kinds of problems we’ve had\ntrying to recruit in Luthadel.”\n“We won’t need the general population to support us,” Kelsier said. “Just\na small percentage of them—there are nearly a million workers in and\naround Luthadel. This should actually be the easiest part of the plan, since\nwe happen to be in the presence of one of the world’s greatest Soothers.\nBreeze, I’m counting on you and your Allomancers to force us up a nice\nselection of recruits.”\nBreeze sipped his wine. “Kelsier, my good man. I wish you wouldn’t use\nwords like ‘force’ in reference to my talents. I simply encourage people.”\n“Well, can you encourage us up an army?” Dockson asked.\n“How much time do I have?” Breeze asked.\n“A year,” Kelsier said. “We’ll plan this to go off next fall. Assuming the\nLord Ruler does gather his forces to attack Yeden once we take the city, we\nmight as well make him do it in the winter.”\n“Ten thousand men,” Breeze said with a smile, “gathered from a resistant\npopulation in less than a year. It would certainly be a challenge.”\nKelsier chuckled. “From you, that’s as good as a yes. Start in Luthadel,\nthen move to the surrounding cities. We need people who are close enough\nto gather at the caves.”\nBreeze nodded.\n“We’ll also need weapons and supplies,” Ham said. “And we’ll need to\ntrain the men.”\n“I’ve already got a plan to get weapons,” Kelsier said. “Can you find\nsome men to do the training?”\nHam paused thoughtfully. “Probably. I know some skaa soldiers who\nfought in one of the Lord Ruler’s Suppression Campaigns.”\nYeden paled. “Traitors!”\nHam shrugged. “Most of them aren’t proud of what they did,” he said.\n“But most of them also like to eat. It’s a hard world, Yeden.”\n“My people will never work with such men,” Yeden said.\n“They’ll have to,” Kelsier said sternly. “A large number of skaa\nrebellions fail because their men are poorly trained. We’re going to give you\nan army of well-equipped, well-fed men—and I’ll be damned if I’m going\nto let you get them slaughtered because they were never taught which end\nof the sword to hold.”\nKelsier paused, then eyed Ham. “However, I do suggest that you find\nmen who are bitter against the Final Empire for what it forced them to do. I\ndon’t trust men whose loyalty only goes as far as the boxings in their\npockets.”\nHam nodded, and Yeden quieted. Kelsier turned, writing Ham: Training\nand Breeze: Recruitment beneath Troops on the board.\n“I’m interested in your plan to get weapons,” Breeze said. “How, exactly,\ndo you intend to arm ten thousand men without making the Lord Ruler"

He keeps a very careful eye on the armament flows.”\n“We could make the weapons,” Clubs said. “I have enough extra wood\nthat we could churn out a war staff or two every day. Could probably get\nyou some arrows too.”\n“I appreciate the offer, Clubs,” Kelsier said. “And I think that’s a good\nidea. However, we’re going to need more than staves. We’ll need swords,\nshields, and armor—and we need them quickly enough to begin training.”\n“How, then, are you going to do it?” Breeze asked.\n“The Great Houses can get weapons,” Kelsier said. “They don’t have any\nproblems arming their personal retinues.”\n“You want us to steal from them?”\nKelsier shook his head. “No, for once we’re going to do things somewhat\nlegally—we’re going to buy our weapons. Or, rather, we’re going to have a\nsympathetic nobleman buy them for us.”\nClubs laughed bluntly. “A nobleman sympathetic to the skaa? It will\nnever happen.”\n“Well, ‘never’ happened a short time ago, then,” Kelsier said lightly.\n“Because I’ve already found someone to help us.”\nThe room fell silent save for the crackling of the fireplace. Vin squirmed\nslightly in her chair, glancing at the others. They seemed shocked.\n“Who?” Ham asked.\n“His name is Lord Renoux,” Kelsier said. “He arrived in the area a few\ndays back. He’s staying in Fellise—he doesn’t quite have enough influence\nto establish himself in Luthadel. Besides, I think it’s prudent to keep\nRenoux’s activities a bit removed from the Lord Ruler.”\nVin cocked her head. Fellise was a small, suburb-style city an hour\noutside of Luthadel; she and Reen had worked there before moving into the\ncapital city. How had Kelsier recruited this Lord Renoux? Had he bribed the\nman, or was it some sort of scam?\n“I know of Renoux,” Breeze said slowly. “He’s a Western lord; he has a\ngreat deal of power in the Farmost Dominance.”\nKelsier nodded. “Lord Renoux recently decided to try and elevate his\nfamily to high noble status. His official story is that he came south in order\nto expand his mercantile efforts. He hopes that by shipping fine Southern\nweaponry to the North, he can earn enough money—and make enough\nconnections—to build himself a keep in Luthadel by the end of the decade.”\nThe room was quiet.\n“But,” Ham said slowly, “those weapons will be coming to us instead.”\nKelsier nodded. “We’ll have to fake the shipping records, just in case.”\n“That’s . . . quite an ambitious front, Kell,” Ham said. “A lord’s family\nworking on our side.”\n“But,” Breeze said, looking confused. “Kelsier, you hate noblemen.”\n“This one’s different,” Kelsier said with a sly smile.\nThe crew studied Kelsier.

It probably didn’t help that Renoux was so\npowerful.\nSuddenly, Breeze laughed. He leaned back in his chair, downing the last\nof his wine. “You blessed madman! You killed him, didn’t you? Renoux—\nyou killed him and replaced him with an impostor.”\nKelsier’s smile broadened.\nYeden cursed, but Ham simply smiled. “Ah. Now that makes sense. Or,\nat least, it makes sense if you’re Kelsier the Foolhardy.”\n“Renoux is going to take up permanent residence in Fellise,” Kelsier\nsaid. “He’ll be our front if we need to do anything official. I’ll use him to\npurchase armaments and supplies, for instance.”\nBreeze nodded thoughtfully. “Efficient.”\n“Efficient?” Yeden asked. “You’ve killed a nobleman! A very important\none.”\n“You’re planning to overthrow the entire empire, Yeden,” Kelsier noted.\n“Renoux isn’t going to be the last aristocratic casualty in this little\nendeavor.”\n“Yes, but impersonating him?” Yeden asked. “That sounds a little risky to\nme.”\n“You hired us because you wanted extraordinary results, my dear man,”\nBreeze said, sipping his wine. “In our line of work, extraordinary results\nusually require extraordinary risks.”\n“We minimize them as best we can, Yeden,” Kelsier said. “My actor is\nvery good. However, these are the sorts of things we’re going to be doing in\nthis job.”\n“And if I order you to stop a few of them?” Yeden asked.\n“You can shut down the job at any time,” Dockson said, not looking up\nfrom his ledgers. “But as long as it is in motion, Kelsier has final say on\nplans, objectives, and procedures. That is how we work; you knew that\nwhen you hired us.”\nYeden shook his head ruefully.\n“Well?” Kelsier asked. “Do we continue or not? The call is yours,\nYeden.”\n“Feel free to call an end to it, friend,” Breeze said with a helpful voice.\n“Don’t be afraid of offending us. I, for one, look favorably upon free\nmoney.”\nVin saw Yeden pale slightly. In Vin’s estimation, he was fortunate that\nKelsier hadn’t simply taken his money and stabbed him in the chest. But,\nshe was becoming increasingly convinced that wasn’t the way things\nworked around here.\n“This is insane,” Yeden said.\n“Trying to overthrow the Lord Ruler?” Breeze asked. “Why, yes, as a\nmatter of fact, it is.”\n“All right,” Yeden said, sighing. “We continue.”\n“Good,” Kelsier said, writing Kelsier: Equipment under Troops. “The\nRenoux front will also give us an ‘in’ with Luthadel high society. This will\nbe a very important advantage—we’ll need to keep careful track of Great\nHouse politics if we’re going to start a war.”\n“This house war might not be as easy to pull off as you think, Kelsier,”"

You’re\nan expert at making people do what you want—together, you and I will plan\nhow to make the high nobility turn on each other. Major house wars seem to\nhappen every couple of centuries or so. The current group’s competence\nwill only make them more dangerous, so getting them riled up shouldn’t be\nthat hard. In fact, I’ve already started the process. . . .”\nBreeze raised an eyebrow, then glanced at Ham. The Thug grumbled a\nbit, pulling out a golden ten-boxing coin and flipping it across the room to\nthe self-satisfied Breeze.\n“What was that about?” Dockson asked.\n“We had a bet,” Breeze said, “regarding whether or not Kelsier was\ninvolved in last night’s disturbance.”\n“Disturbance?” Yeden asked. “What disturbance?”\n“Someone attacked House Venture,” Ham said. “The rumors claim that\nthree full Mistborn were sent to assassinate Straff Venture himself.”\nKelsier snorted. “Three? Straff certainly has an elevated opinion of\nhimself. I didn’t go anywhere near His Lordship. I was there for the atium\n—and to make certain that I was seen.”\n“Venture isn’t sure who to blame,” Breeze said. “But because Mistborn\nwere involved, everyone assumes that it was one of the Great Houses.”\n“That was the idea,” Kelsier said happily. “The high nobility take\nMistborn attacks very seriously—they have an unspoken agreement that\nthey won’t use Mistborn to assassinate each other. A few more strikes like\nthis, and I’ll have them snapping at each other like frightened animals.”\nHe turned, adding Breeze: Planning and Kelsier: General Mayhem\nbeneath Great Houses on the board.\n“Anyway,” Kelsier continued, “we’ll need to keep an eye on local\npolitics to find out which Houses are making alliances. That means sending\na spy to some of their functions.”\n“Is that really necessary?” Yeden asked uncomfortably.\nHam nodded. “It’s standard procedure for any Luthadel job, actually. If\nthere is information to be had, it will pass through the lips of the court’s\npowerful. It always pays to keep an open set of ears moving through their\ncircles.”\n“Well, that should be easy,” Breeze said. “We just bring up your impostor\nand send him into the parties.”\nKelsier shook his head. “Unfortunately, Lord Renoux himself won’t be\nable to come to Luthadel.”\nYeden frowned. “Why not? Won’t your impostor hold up to close\nscrutiny?”\n“Oh, he looks just like Lord Renoux,” Kelsier said. “Exactly like Lord\nRenoux, actually. We just can’t let him get near an Inquisitor. . . .”\n“Ah,” Breeze said, exchanging a glance with Ham. “One of those. Well,\nthen.”"

Well,\nthen.”\n“What?” Yeden asked. “What does he mean?”\n“You don’t want to know,” Breeze said.\n“I don’t?”\nBreeze shook his head. “You know how unsettled you just were when\nKelsier said he’d replaced Lord Renoux with an impostor? Well, this is\nabout a dozen times worse. Trust me—the less you know, the more\ncomfortable you’ll be.”\nYeden looked toward Kelsier, who was smiling broadly. Yeden paled,\nthen leaned back in his chair. “I think you’re probably right.”\nVin frowned, eying the others in the room. They seemed to know what\nKelsier was talking about. She’d have to study this Lord Renoux sometime.\n“Anyway,” Kelsier said, “we have to send someone to the social\nfunctions. Dox, therefore, will be playing Renoux’s nephew and heir, a\nscion of the family who has recently gained favor with Lord Renoux.”\n“Wait a moment, Kell,” Dockson said. “You didn’t tell me about this.”\nKelsier shrugged. “We’re going to need someone to be our dupe with the\nnobility. I assumed that you’d fit the role.”\n“Can’t be me,” Dockson said. “I got marked during the Eiser job just a\ncouple months back.”\nKelsier frowned.\n“What?” Yeden asked. “Do I want to know what they’re talking about\nthis time?”\n“He means that the Ministry is watching for him,” Breeze said. “He\npretended to be a nobleman, and they found out.”\nDockson nodded. “The Lord Ruler himself saw me on one occasion, and\nhe’s got a flawless memory. Even if I managed to avoid him, someone’s\nbound to recognize me eventually.”\n“So . . .” Yeden said.\n“So,” Kelsier said, “we’ll need someone else to play Lord Renoux’s\nheir.”\n“Don’t look at me,” Yeden said apprehensively.\n“Trust me,” Kelsier said flatly, “nobody was. Clubs is out too—he’s far\ntoo prominent a local skaa craftsman.”\n“I’m out as well,” Breeze said. “I already have several aliases among the\nnobility. I suppose I could use one of them, but I couldn’t go to any major\nballs or parties—it would be rather embarrassing if I met someone who\nknew me by a different alias.”\nKelsier frowned thoughtfully.\n“I could do it,” Ham said. “But you know I’m no good at acting.”\n“What about my nephew?” Clubs said, nodding to the young man at his\nside.\nKelsier studied the boy. “What’s your name, son?”\n“Lestibournes.”\nKelsier raised an eyebrow. “That’s a mouthful. You don’t have a\nnickname?”\n“Not of the yetting yet.”\n“We’ll have to work on that,” Kelsier said. “Do you always speak in that\nEastern street slang?”\nThe boy shrugged, obviously nervous at being such a center of attention.\n“Wasing the place when I was young.”"

But, I’ve never\nactually tried to. . . .”\n“You’ll do fine,” Kelsier said, writing Vin: Infiltration underneath Great\nHouses. “All right. Yeden, you should probably begin planning how you’re\nto keep control of the empire once this is all through.”\nYeden nodded. Vin felt a little sorry for the man, seeing how much the\nplanning—the sheer outrageousness of it all—seemed to be overwhelming\nhim. Still, it was hard to feel sympathy for him, considering what Kelsier\nhad just said regarding her part in all this.\nPlaying a noblewoman? she thought. Surely there’s someone else who\ncould do a better job. . . .\nBreeze’s attention was still on Yeden and his obvious discomfort. “Don’t\nlook so solemn, my dear fellow,” Breeze said. “Why, you’ll probably never\nactually have to rule the city. Chances are, we’ll all get caught and executed\nlong before that happens.”\nYeden smiled wanly. “And if we don’t? What’s to keep you all from just\nknifing me and taking the empire for yourselves?”\nBreeze rolled his eyes. “We’re thieves, my dear man, not politicians. A\nnation is far too unwieldy a commodity to be worth our time. Once we have\nour atium, we’ll be happy.”\n“Not to mention rich,” Ham added.\n“The two words are synonyms, Hammond,” Breeze said.\n“Besides,” Kelsier said to Yeden. “We won’t be giving you the entire\nempire—hopefully, it will shatter once Luthadel destabilizes. You’ll have\nthis city, and probably a good piece of the Central Dominance—assuming\nyou can bribe the local armies into supporting you.”\n“And . . . the Lord Ruler?” Yeden asked.\nKelsier smiled. “I’m still planning to deal with him personally—I just\nhave to figure out how to make the Eleventh Metal work.”\n“And if you don’t?”\n“Well,” Kelsier said, writing Yeden: Preparation and Rule beneath Skaa\nRebellion on the board, “we’ll try and find a way to trick him out of the city.\nPerhaps we can get him to go with his army to the Pits and secure things\nthere.”\n“Then what?” Yeden asked.\n“You find some way to deal with him,” Kelsier said. “You didn’t hire us\nto kill the Lord Ruler, Yeden—that’s just a possible perk I intend to throw in\nif I can.”\n“I wouldn’t worry too much, Yeden,” Ham added. “He won’t be able to\ndo much without funds or armies.

Shouldn’t we at least find a\nway to keep an eye on those Inquisitors?”\nKelsier smiled. “We’ll let my brother deal with them.”\n“Like hell you will,” a new voice said from the back of the room.\nVin jumped to her feet, spinning and glancing toward the room’s\nshadowed doorway. A man stood there. Tall and broad-shouldered, he had a\nstatuesque rigidity. He wore modest clothing—a simple shirt and trousers\nwith a loose skaa jacket. His arms were folded in dissatisfaction, and he had\na hard, square face that looked a bit familiar.\nVin glanced back at Kelsier. The similarity was obvious.\n“Marsh?” Yeden said, standing. “Marsh, it is you! He promised you’d be\njoining the job, but I . . . well . . . welcome back!”\nMarsh’s face remained impassive. “I’m not certain if I’m ‘back’ or not,\nYeden. If you all don’t mind, I’d like to speak privately with my little\nbrother.”\nKelsier didn’t seem intimidated by Marsh’s harsh tone. He nodded to the\ngroup. “We’re done for the evening, folks.”\nThe others rose slowly, giving Marsh a wide berth as they left. Vin\nfollowed them, pulling the door shut and walking down the stairs to give\nthe appearance of retiring to her room.\nLess than three minutes later she was back at the door, listening carefully\nto the conversation going on inside.\nRashek is a tall man—of course, most of these Terrismen are tall. He is young to receive so much respect from the other packmen. He has charisma, and the women of\ncourt would probably describe him as handsome, in a rugged sort of way.\nYet, it amazes me that anyone would give heed to a man who speaks such hatred. He has never seen Khlennium, yet he curses the city. He does not know me, yet I\ncan already see the anger and hostility in his eyes.\n7\nT M appearance much. He was still the stern,\nHREE YEARS HADN’T CHANGED ARSH’S\ncommanding person Kelsier had known since childhood. There was still\nthat glint of disappointment in his eyes, and he spoke with the same air of\ndisapproval.\nYet, if Dockson were to be believed, Marsh’s attitudes had changed much\nsince that day three years before. Kelsier still found it hard to believe that\nhis brother had given up leadership of the skaa rebellion. He had always\nbeen so passionate about his work.\nApparently, that passion had dimmed. Marsh walked forward, regarding\nthe charcoal writing board with a critical eye. His clothing was stained\nslightly by dark ash, though his face was relatively clean, for a skaa.

Finally, Marsh turned and\ntossed a sheet of paper onto the chair beside Kelsier.\n“What is this?” Kelsier asked, picking it up.\n“The names of the eleven men you slaughtered last night,” Marsh said. “I\nthought you might at least want to know.”\nKelsier tossed the paper into the crackling hearth. “They served the Final\nEmpire.”\n“They were men, Kelsier,” Marsh snapped. “They had lives, families.\nSeveral of them were skaa.”\n“Traitors.”\n“People,” Marsh said. “People who were just trying to do the best with\nwhat life gave them.”\n“Well, I’m just doing the same thing,” Kelsier said. “And, fortunately,\nlife gave me the ability to push men like them off the tops of buildings. If\nthey want to stand against me like noblemen, then they can die like\nnoblemen.”\nMarsh’s expression darkened. “How can you be so flippant about\nsomething like this?”\n“Because, Marsh,” Kelsier said, “humor is the only thing I’ve got left.\nHumor and determination.”\nMarsh snorted quietly.\n“You should be happy,” Kelsier said. “After decades of listening to your\nlectures, I’ve finally decided to do something worthwhile with my talents.\nNow that you’re here to help, I’m sure—”\n“I’m not here to help,” Marsh interrupted.\n“Then why did you come?”\n“To ask you a question.” Marsh stepped forward, stopping right in front\nof Kelsier. They were about the same height, but Marsh’s stern personality\nalways made him seem to loom taller.\n“How dare you do this?” Marsh asked quietly. “I dedicated my life to\noverthrowing the Final Empire. While you and your thieving friends\npartied, I hid runaways. While you planned petty burglaries, I organized\nraids. While you lived in luxury, I watched brave people die of starvation.”\nMarsh reached up, stabbing a finger at Kelsier’s chest. “How dare you?\nHow dare you try and hijack the rebellion for one of your little ‘jobs’? How\ndare you use this dream as a way of enriching yourself?”\nKelsier pushed Marsh’s finger away. “That’s not what this is about.”\n“Oh?” Marsh asked, tapping the word atium on the board. “Why the\ngames, Kelsier? Why lead Yeden along, pretending to accept him as your\n‘employer’? Why act like you care about the skaa? We both know what\nyou’re really after.”\nKelsier clenched his jaw, a bit of his humor melting away. He always\ncould do that to me. “You don’t know me anymore, Marsh,” Kelsier said\nquietly. “This isn’t about money—I once had more wealth than any man\ncould spend. This job is about something different.”\nMarsh stood close, studying Kelsier’s eyes, as if searching for truth in\nthem. “You always were a good liar,” he finally said.\nKelsier rolled his eyes. “Fine, think what you want.

Everything the rebellion\nhas done—the raids, the thefts, the deaths—has accomplished nothing. Our\nbest efforts were never even a mild annoyance for the Lord Ruler.”\n“Ah,” Kelsier said, “but being an annoyance is something that I am very\ngood at. In fact, I’m far more than just a ‘mild’ annoyance—people tell me I\ncan be downright frustrating. Might as well use this talent for the cause of\ngood, eh?”\nMarsh sighed, turning away. “This isn’t about a ‘cause,’ Kelsier. It’s\nabout revenge. It’s about you, just like everything always is. I’ll believe that\nyou aren’t after the money—I’ll even believe that you intend to deliver\nYeden this army he’s apparently paying you for. But I won’t believe that\nyou care.”\n“That’s where you are wrong, Marsh,” Kelsier said quietly. “That’s where\nyou’ve always been wrong about me.”\nMarsh frowned. “Perhaps. How did this start, anyway? Did Yeden come\nto you, or did you go to him?”\n“Does it matter?” Kelsier asked. “Look, Marsh. I need someone to\ninfiltrate the Ministry. This plan won’t go anywhere if we don’t discover a\nway to keep an eye on those Inquisitors.”\nMarsh turned. “You actually expect me to help you?”\nKelsier nodded. “That’s why you came here, no matter what you say. You\nonce told me that you thought I could do great things if I ever applied\nmyself to a worthy goal. Well, that’s what I’m doing now—and you’re\ngoing to help.”\n“It’s not that easy anymore, Kell,” Marsh said with a shake of his head.\n“Some people are different now. Others are . . . gone.”\nKelsier let the room grow quiet. Even the hearth’s fire was starting to die\nout. “I miss her too.”\n“I’m sure that you do—but I have to be honest with you, Kell. Despite\nwhat she did . . . sometimes I wish that you hadn’t been the one to survive\nthe Pits.”\n“I wish the same thing every day.”\nMarsh turned, studying Kelsier with his cold, discerning eyes. The eyes\nof a Seeker. Whatever he saw reflected inside of Kelsier must have finally\nmet with his approval.\n“I’m leaving,” Marsh said. “But, for some reason you actually seem\nsincere this time. I’ll come back and listen to whatever insane plan you’ve\nconcocted. Then . . . well, we’ll see.”\nKelsier smiled. Beneath it all, Marsh was a good man—a better one than\nKelsier had ever been.

The blue lines were thin and weak—they didn’t do well penetrating\nwood—but they were just strong enough to let Kelsier locate the belt latch\nof a person out in the hallway, moving quickly away from the door on silent\nfeet.\nKelsier smiled to himself. The girl was remarkably skilled. Her time on\nthe streets, however, had also left her with remarkable scars. Hopefully, he\nwould be able to encourage the skills while helping heal the scars.\n“I’ll return tomorrow,” Marsh said as he reached the door.\n“Just don’t come by too early,” Kelsier said with a wink. “I’ve got some\nthings to do tonight.”\nVin waited quietly in her darkened room, listening to footsteps clomp down\nthe stairs to the ground floor. She crouched beside her door, trying to\ndetermine if both sets had continued down the steps or not. The hallway fell\nsilent, and eventually she breathed a quiet sigh of relief.\nA knock sounded on the door just inches from her head.\nHer start of surprise nearly knocked her to the ground.

She untucked her shirt, and waited until the\nknock came again before pulling open the door.\nKelsier lounged against the doorframe, backlit by the hallway’s single\nlantern. The tall man raised an eyebrow at her disheveled state.\n“Yes?” Vin asked, trying to sound drowsy.\n“So, what do you think of Marsh?”\n“I don’t know,” Vin said, “I didn’t see much of him before he kicked us\nout.”\nKelsier smiled. “You’re not going to admit that I caught you, are you?”\nVin almost smiled back. Reen’s training came to her rescue. The man\nwho wants you to trust him is the one you must fear the most. Her brother’s\nvoice almost seemed to whisper in her head. It had grown stronger since\nshe’d met Kelsier, as if her instincts were on edge.\nKelsier studied her for a moment, then stepped back from the doorframe.\n“Tuck in that shirt and follow me.”\nVin frowned. “Where are we going?”\n“To begin your training.”\n“Now?” Vin asked, glancing at the dark shutters to her room.\n“Of course,” Kelsier said. “It’s a perfect night for a stroll.”\nVin straightened her clothing, joining him in the hallway. If he actually\nplanned to begin teaching her, then she wasn’t going to complain, no matter\nwhat the hour. They walked down the steps to the first floor. The workroom\nwas dark, furniture projects lying half finished in the shadows. The kitchen,\nhowever, was bright with light.\n“Just a minute,” Kelsier said, walking toward the kitchen.\nVin paused just inside the shadows of the workroom, letting Kelsier enter"

        "text": "however, was bright with light.\n“Just a minute,” Kelsier said, walking toward the kitchen.\nVin paused just inside the shadows of the workroom, letting Kelsier enter\nthe kitchen without her. She could just barely see inside. Dockson, Breeze,\nand Ham sat with Clubs and his apprentices around a wide table. Wine and\nale were present, though in small amounts, and the men were munching on\na simple evening snack of puffed barley cakes and battered vegetables.\nLaughter trickled out into the workroom. Not raucous laughter, such as\nhad often sounded from Camon’s table. This was something softer—\nsomething indicative of genuine mirth, of good-natured enjoyment.\nVin wasn’t certain what kept her out of the room. She hesitated—as if the\nlight and the humor were a barrier—and she instead remained in the quiet,\nsolemn workroom. She watched from the darkness, however, and wasn’t\ncompletely able to suppress her longing.\nKelsier returned a moment later, carrying his pack and a small cloth\nbundle. Vin regarded the bundle with curiosity, and he handed it to her with\na smile. “A present.”\nThe cloth was slick and soft in Vin’s fingers, and she quickly realized\nwhat it was. She let the gray material unroll in her fingers, revealing a\nMistborn cloak. Like the garment Kelsier had worn the night before, it was\ntailored completely from separate, ribbonlike strips of cloth.\n“You look surprised,” Kelsier noted.\n“I . . . assumed that I’d have to earn this somehow.”\n“What’s there to earn?” Kelsier said, pulling out his own cloak. “This is\nwho you are, Vin.”\nShe paused, then threw the cloak over her shoulders and tied it on. It felt .\n. . different. Thick and heavy on her shoulders, but light and unconstraining\naround her arms and legs. The ribbons were sewn together at the top,\nallowing her to pull it tight by the mantle if she wished. She felt . . .\nenveloped. Protected.\n“How does it feel?” Kelsier asked.\n“Good,” Vin said simply.\nKelsier nodded, pulling out several glass vials. He handed two to her.\n“Drink one; keep the other in case you need it. I’ll show you how to mix\nnew vials later.”\nVin nodded, downing the first vial and tucking the second into her belt.\n“I’m having some new clothing tailored for you,” Kelsier said. “You’ll\nwant to get into the habit of wearing things that don’t have any metal on\nthem: belts with no buckles, shoes that slip on and off, trousers without\nclasps. Perhaps later, if you’re feeling daring, we’ll get you some women’s\nclothing.”\nVin flushed slightly.\nKelsier laughed. “I’m just teasing you. However, you’re entering a new\nworld now—you may find that there are situations where it will be to your\nadvantage to look less like a crew thief and more like a young lady.”\nVin nodded, following Kelsier as he walked to the shop’s front door. He\npushed the portal open, revealing a wall of darkly shifting mists. He stepped\nout into them. Taking a deep breath, Vin followed."

The cobbled street felt muffled to Vin,\nthe shifting mists making everything just a bit damp. She couldn’t see far in\neither direction, and the street ends seemed to fade into nothingness, paths\ninto eternity. Above, there was no sky, just swirling currents of gray upon\ngray.\n“All right, let’s begin,” Kelsier said. His voice felt loud in the quiet,\nempty street. There was a confidence to his tone, something that—\nconfronted with the mists all around—Vin certainly didn’t feel.\n“Your first lesson,” Kelsier said, strolling down the street, Vin trailing\nalong beside him, “isn’t about Allomancy, but attitude.” He swept his hand\nforward. “This, Vin. This is ours. The night, the mists—they belong to us.\nSkaa avoid the mists as if they were death. Thieves and soldiers go out at\nnight, but they fear it nonetheless. Noblemen feign nonchalance, but the\nmist makes them uncomfortable.”\nHe turned, regarding her. “The mists are your friend, Vin. They hide you,\nthey protect you . . . and they give you power. Ministry doctrine—\nsomething rarely shared with skaa—claims that the Mistborn are\ndescendants of the only men who remained true to the Lord Ruler during\nthe days before his Ascension. Other legends whisper that we are something\nbeyond even the Lord Ruler’s power, something that was born on that day\nwhen the mists first came upon the land.”\nVin nodded slightly. It seemed odd to hear Kelsier speak so openly.\nBuildings filled with sleeping skaa loomed on either side of the street. And\nyet, the dark shutters and quiet air made Vin feel as if she and Kelsier were\nalone. Alone in the most densely populated, overcrowded city in all of the\nFinal Empire.\nKelsier continued to walk, the spring in his step incongruent with the\ndark gloom.\n“Shouldn’t we be worried about soldiers?” Vin asked quietly. Her crews\nalways had to be careful of nighttime Garrison patrols.\nKelsier shook his head. “Even if we were careless enough to be spotted,\nno imperial patrol would dare bother Mistborn. They’d see our cloaks and\npretend not to see us. Remember, nearly all Mistborn are members of the\nGreat Houses—and the rest are from lesser Luthadel houses. Either way,\nthey’re very important individuals.”\nVin frowned. “So, the guards just ignore the Mistborn?”\nKelsier shrugged. “It’s bad etiquette to acknowledge that the skulking\nrooftop figure you see is actually a very distinguished and proper high lord\n—or even high lady. Mistborn are so rare that houses can’t afford to apply\ngender prejudices to them.\n“Anyway, most Mistborn live two lives—the life of the courtgoing\naristocrat, and the life of the sneaking, spying Allomancer. Mistborn\nidentities are closely guarded house secrets—rumors regarding who is\nMistborn are always a focus of high noble gossip.”\nKelsier turned down another street, Vin following, still a bit nervous.

She\nwasn’t certain where he was taking her; it was easy to get lost in the night.\nPerhaps he didn’t even have a destination, and was just accustoming her to\nthe mists.\n“All right,” Kelsier said, “let’s get you used to the basic metals. Can you\nfeel your metal reserves?”\nVin paused. If she focused, she could distinguish eight sources of power\nwithin her—each one far larger, even, than her two had been on the day\nwhen Kelsier had tested her. She had been reticent to use her Luck much\nsince then. She was coming to realize that she had been using a weapon\nshe’d never really understood—a weapon that had accidentally drawn the\nattention of a Steel Inquisitor.\n“Begin burning them, one at a time,” Kelsier said.\n“Burning?”\n“That’s what we call it when you activate an Allomantic ability,” Kelsier\nsaid. “You ‘burn’ the metal associated with that power. You’ll see what I\nmean. Start with the metals you don’t know about yet—we’ll work on\nSoothing and Raging emotions some other time.”\nVin nodded, pausing in the middle of the street. Tentatively, she reached\nout to one of the new sources of power. One of them was slightly familiar to\nher. Had she used it before without realizing it? What would it do?\nOnly one way to find out . . . Uncertain what, exactly, she was supposed\nto do, Vin gripped the source of power and tried to use it.\nImmediately, she felt a flare of heat from within her chest. It wasn’t\ndiscomforting, but it was obvious and distinct. Along with the warmth came\nsomething else—a feeling of rejuvenation, and of power. She felt . . . more\nsolid, somehow.\n“What happened?” Kelsier asked.\n“I feel different,” Vin said. She held up her hand, and it seemed as if the\nlimb reacted just a bit too quickly. The muscles were eager. “My body is\nstrange. I don’t feel tired anymore, and I feel alert.”\n“Ah,” Kelsier said. “That’s pewter. It enhances your physical abilities,\nmaking you stronger, more able to resist fatigue and pain. You’ll react more\nquickly when you’re burning it, and your body will be tougher.”\nVin flexed experimentally. Her muscles didn’t seem any bigger, yet she\ncould feel their strength. It wasn’t just in her muscles, however—it was\neverything about her. Her bones, her flesh, her skin. She reached out to her\nreserve, and could feel it shrinking.\n“I’m running out,” she said.\nKelsier nodded. “Pewter burns relatively quickly. The vial I gave you\nwas measured to contain about ten minutes’ worth of continuous burning—\nthough it will go faster if you flare often and slower if you are careful about\nwhen you use it.”\n“Flare?”\n“You can burn your metals a little more powerfully if you try,” Kelsier\nsaid. “It makes them run out much faster, and it’s difficult to maintain, but it\ncan give you an extra boost.”"

With a push of effort, she was able\nto stoke the flames within her chest, flaring the pewter.\nIt was like the inhaled breath before a daring leap. A sudden rush of\nstrength and power. Her body grew tense with anticipation, and for just a\nmoment she felt invincible. Then it passed, her body relaxing slowly.\nInteresting, she thought, noting how quickly her pewter had burned\nduring that brief moment.\n“Now, there’s something you need to know about Allomantic metals,”\nKelsier said as they strolled forward in the mists. “The more pure they are,\nthe more effective they are. The vials we prepare contain absolutely pure\nmetals, prepared and sold specifically for Allomancers.\n“Alloys—like pewter—are even trickier, since the metal percentages\nhave to be mixed just right, if you want maximum power. In fact, if you\naren’t careful when you buy your metals, you could end up with the wrong\nalloy entirely.”\nVin frowned. “You mean, someone might scam me?”\n“Not intentionally,” Kelsier said. “The thing is, most of the terms that\npeople use—words like ‘brass,’ ‘pewter,’ and ‘bronze’—are really quite\nvague, when you get down to it. Pewter, for instance, is generally accepted\nas an alloy of tin mixed with lead, with perhaps some copper or silver,\ndepending on the use and the circumstances. Allomancer’s pewter, however,\nis an alloy of ninety-one percent tin, nine percent lead. If you want\nmaximum strength from your metal, you have to use those percentages.”\n“And . . . if you burn the wrong percentage?” Vin asked.\n“If the mixture is only off by a bit, you’ll still get some power out of it,”\nKelsier said. “However, if it’s too far off, burning it will make you sick.”\nVin nodded slowly. “I . . . think I’ve burned this metal before. Once in a\nwhile, in very small amounts.”\n“Trace metals,” Kelsier said. “From drinking water contaminated by\nmetals, or by eating with pewter utensils.”\nVin nodded. Some of the mugs in Camon’s lair had been pewter.\n“All right,” Kelsier said. “Extinguish the pewter and let’s move on to\nanother metal.”\nVin did as asked. The withdrawal of power left her feeling weak, tired,\nand exposed.\n“Now,” Kelsier said, “you should be able to notice a kind of pairing\nbetween your reserves of metal.”\n“Like the two emotion metals,” Vin said.\n“Exactly. Find the metal linked to pewter.”\n“I see it,” Vin said.\n“There are two metals for every power,” Kelsier said. “One Pushes, one\nPulls—the second is usually an alloy of the first. For emotions—the\nexternal mental powers—you Pull with zinc and Push with brass. You just\nused pewter to Push your body. That’s one of the internal physical powers.”\n“Like Ham,” Vin said. “He burns pewter.”"

That’s one of the internal physical powers.”\n“Like Ham,” Vin said. “He burns pewter.”\nKelsier nodded. “Mistings who can burn pewter are called Thugs. A\ncrude term, I suppose—but they tend to be rather crude people. Our dear\nHammond is something of an exception to that rule.”\n“So, what does the other internal physical metal do?”\n“Try it and see.”\nVin did so eagerly, and the world suddenly became brighter around her.\nOr . . . well, that wasn’t quite right. She could see better, and she could see\nfarther, but the mists were still there. They were just . . . more translucent.\nThe ambient light around her seemed brighter, somehow.\nThere were other changes. She could feel her clothing. She realized that\nshe had always been able to feel it, but she usually ignored it. Now,\nhowever, it felt closer. She could sense the textures, and was acutely aware\nof the places where the cloth was tight on her.\nShe was hungry. That, too, she had been ignoring—yet now her hunger\nseemed far more pressing. Her skin felt wetter, and she could smell the crisp\nair mixed with scents of dirt, soot, and refuse.\n“Tin enhances your senses,” Kelsier said, his voice suddenly seeming\nquite loud. “And it’s one of the slowest-burning metals—the tin in that vial\nis enough to keep you going for hours. Most Mistborn leave their tin on\nwhenever they’re out in the mists—I’ve had mine on since we left the\nshop.”\nVin nodded. The wealth of sensations was nearly overwhelming. She\ncould hear creaks and scuffles in the darkness, and they made her want to\njump in alarm, certain that someone was sneaking up behind her.\nThis is going to take some getting used to.\n“Leave it burning,” Kelsier said, waving for her to walk beside him as he\ncontinued down the street. “You’ll want to accustom yourself to the\nenhanced senses. Just don’t flare it all the time. Not only would you run out\nof it very quickly, but perpetually flaring metals does . . . strange things to\npeople.”\n“Strange?” Vin asked.\n“Metals—especially tin and pewter—stretch your body. Flaring the\nmetals only pushes this stretching further. Stretch it too far for too long, and\nthings start to break.”\nVin nodded uncomfortably. Kelsier fell quiet, and they continued to walk,\nletting Vin explore her new sensations and the detailed world that tin\nrevealed. Before, her vision had been restricted to a tiny pocket within the\nnight. Now, however, she saw an entire city enveloped by a blanket of\nshifting, swirling mist. She could make out keeps like small, dark\nmountains in the distance, and could see specks of light from windows, like\npin-pricked holes in the night. And above . . . she saw lights in the sky.\nShe stopped, gazing up with wonder. They were faint, blurred to even her\ntin-enhanced eyes, but she could just barely make them out. Hundreds of\nthem. Thousands of them. So small, like the dying embers of candles\nrecently extinguished."

So small, like the dying embers of candles\nrecently extinguished.\n“Stars,” Kelsier said, strolling up beside her. “You can’t see them very\noften, even with tin. It must be a particularly clear night. People used to be\nable to look up and see them every night—that was before the mists came,\nbefore the Ashmounts erupted ash and smoke into the sky.”\nVin glanced at him. “How do you know?”\nKelsier smiled. “The Lord Ruler has tried very hard to crush memories of\nthose days, but still some remain.” He turned, not really having answered\nher question, and continued to walk. Vin joined him. Suddenly, with tin, the\nmists around her didn’t seem so ominous. She was beginning to see how\nKelsier could walk about at night with such confidence.\n“All right,” Kelsier eventually said. “Let’s try another metal.”\nVin nodded, leaving her tin on but picking another metal to burn as well.\nWhen she did so, a very strange thing happened—a multitude of faint blue\nlines sprung from her chest, streaking out into the spinning mists. She froze,\ngasping slightly and looking down at her chest. Most of the lines were thin,\nlike translucent pieces of twine, though a couple were as thick as yarn.\nKelsier chuckled. “Leave that metal and its partner alone for the moment.\nThey’re a bit more complicated than the others.”\n“What . . .?” Vin asked, tracing the lines of blue light with her eyes. They\npointed at random objects. Doors, windows—a couple even pointed at\nKelsier.\n“We’ll get to it,” he promised. “Extinguish that one and try one of the last\ntwo.”\nVin extinguished the strange metal and ignored its companion, picking\none of the last metals. Immediately, she felt a strange vibration. Vin paused.\nThe pulses didn’t make a sound that she could hear, yet she could feel them\nwashing across her. They seemed to be coming from Kelsier. She looked at\nhim, frowning.\n“That’s probably bronze,” Kelsier said. “The internal mental Pulling\nmetal. It lets you sense when someone is using Allomancy nearby. Seekers,\nlike my brother, use it. Generally it’s not that useful—unless you happen to\nbe a Steel Inquisitor searching for skaa Mistings.”\nVin paled. “Inquisitors can use Allomancy?”\nKelsier nodded. “They’re all Seekers—I’m not sure if that’s because\nSeekers are chosen to become Inquisitors, or if the process of becoming an\nInquisitor grants the power. Either way, since their main duties are to find\nhalf-breed children and noblemen who use Allomancy improperly, it’s a\nuseful skill for them to have. Unfortunately, ‘useful’ for them means ‘rather\nannoying’ for us.”\nVin began to nod, then froze. The pulsing had stopped.\n“What happened?” she asked.\n“I started burning copper,” Kelsier said, “the companion to bronze. When\nyou burn copper, it hides your use of powers from other Allomancers. You\ncan try burning it now, if you want, though you won’t sense much.”"

The only change was a feeling of slight vibration within her.\n“Copper is a vital metal to learn,” Kelsier said. “It will hide you from\nInquisitors. We probably don’t have anything to worry about tonight—the\nInquisitors would assume us to be regular noble Mistborn, out for training.\nHowever, if you’re ever in a skaa guise and need to burn metals, make sure\nyou turn on your copper first.”\nVin nodded appreciatively.\n“In fact,” Kelsier said, “many Mistborn keep their copper on all the time.\nIt burns slowly, and it makes you invisible to other Allomancers. It hides\nyou from bronze, and it also prevents others from manipulating your\nemotions.”\nVin perked up.\n“I thought that might interest you,” Kelsier said. “Anyone burning copper\nis immune to emotional Allomancy. In addition, copper’s influence occurs\nin a bubble around you. This cloud—called a coppercloud—hides anyone\ninside of it from the senses of a Seeker, though it won’t make them immune\nto emotional Allomancy, like it will you.”\n“Clubs,” Vin said. “That’s what a Smoker does.”\nKelsier nodded. “If one of our people is noticed by a Seeker, they can run\nback to the lair and disappear. They can also practice their abilities without\nfear of being discovered. Allomantic pulses coming from a shop in a skaa\nsector of town would be a quick giveaway to a passing Inquisitor.”\n“But, you can burn copper,” Vin said. “Why were you so worried about\nfinding a Smoker for the crew?”\n“I can burn copper, true,” Kelsier said. “And so can you. We can use all\nof the powers, but we can’t be everywhere. A successful crewleader needs\nto know how to divide labor, especially on a job as big as this one. Standard\npractice has a coppercloud going at all times in the lair. Clubs doesn’t do it\nall himself—several of those apprentices are Smokers too. When you hire a\nman like Clubs, it’s understood that he’ll provide you with a base of\noperations and a team of Smokers competent enough to keep you hidden at\nall times.”\nVin nodded. However, she was more interested in copper’s ability to\nprotect her emotions. She would need to locate enough of it to keep it\nburning all the time.\nThey started walking again, and Kelsier gave her more time to get used\nto burning tin. Vin’s mind, however, began to wander. Something didn’t feel\n. . . right to her. Why was Kelsier telling her all of these things? It seemed\nlike he was giving away his secrets too easily.\nExcept one, she thought suspiciously. The metal with the blue lines. He\nhasn’t gone back to it yet. Perhaps that was the thing he was going to keep\nfrom her, the power he would hold in reserve to maintain control over her.\nIt must be strong.

The most powerful of the eight.\nAs they walked through the quiet streets, Vin reached tentatively inside.\nShe eyed Kelsier, then carefully burned that unknown metal. Again, the\nlines sprang up around her, pointing in seemingly random directions.\nThe lines moved with her. One end of each thread stayed stuck to her\nchest, while the other end remained attached to a given place along the\nstreet. New lines appeared as she walked, and old ones faded, disappearing\nbehind. The lines came in various widths, and some of them were brighter\nthan others.\nCurious, Vin tested the lines with her mind, trying to discover their\nsecret. She focused on a particularly small and innocent-looking one, and\nfound that she could feel it individually if she concentrated. She almost felt\nlike she could touch it. She reached out with her mind and gave it a slight\ntug.\nThe line shook, and something immediately flew out of the darkness\ntoward her. Vin yelped, trying to jump away, but the object—a rusty nail—\nshot directly toward her.\nSuddenly, something grabbed the nail, ripping it away and throwing it\nback out into the darkness.\nVin came up from her roll in a tense crouch, mistcloak fluttering around\nher. She scanned the darkness, then glanced at Kelsier, who was chuckling\nsoftly.\n“I should have known you’d try that,” he said.\nVin flushed in embarrassment.\n“Come on,” he said, waving her over. “No harm done.”\n“The nail attacked me!” Did that metal bring objects to life? That would\nbe an incredible power indeed.\n“Actually, you kind of attacked yourself,” Kelsier said.\nVin stood carefully, then joined him as he began to walk down the street\nagain.\n“I’ll explain what you did in a moment,” he promised. “First, there’s\nsomething you have to understand about Allomancy.”\n“Another rule?”\n“More a philosophy,” Kelsier said. “It has to do with consequences.”\nVin frowned. “What do you mean?”\n“Every action we take has consequences, Vin,” Kelsier said. “I’ve found\nthat in both Allomancy and life, the person who can best judge the\nconsequences of their actions will be the most successful. Take burning\npewter, for instance. What are its consequences?”\nVin shrugged. “You get stronger.”\n“What happens if you’re carrying something heavy when your pewter\nruns out?”\nVin paused. “I suppose you’d drop it.”\n“And, if it’s too heavy, you could hurt yourself seriously. Many a Misting\nThug has shrugged off a dire wound while fighting, only to die from that\nsame wound once their pewter ran out.”\n“I see,” Vin said quietly.\n“Ha!”\nVin jumped in shock, throwing her hands up over her enhanced ears.\n“Ow!” she complained, glaring at Kelsier.\nHe smiled. “Burning tin has consequences too. If someone produces a\nsudden light or sound, you can be blinded or stunned.”\n“But, what does that have to do with those last two metals?”\n“Iron and steel give you the ability to manipulate other metals around\nyou,” Kelsier explained. “With iron, you can Pull a metal source toward\nyourself. With steel, you can Push one away. Ah, here we are.”"

Ah, here we are.”\nKelsier stopped, looking up ahead.\nThrough the mist, Vin could see the massive city wall looming above\nthem. “What are we doing here?”\n“We’re going to practice Ironpulling and Steelpushing,” Kelsier said.\n“But first, some basics.” He pulled something out of his belt—a clip, the\nsmallest denomination of coin. He held it up before her, standing to the\nside. “Burn steel, the opposite of the metal you burned a few moments\nago.”\nVin nodded. Again, the blue lines sprang up around her. One of them\npointed directly at the coin in Kelsier’s hand.\n“All right,” Kelsier said. “Push on it.”\nVin reached toward the proper thread and Pushed slightly. The coin\nflipped out of Kelsier’s fingers, traveling directly away from Vin. She\ncontinued to focus on it, Pushing the coin through the air until it snapped\nagainst the wall of a nearby house.\nVin was thrown violently backward in a sudden, jerking motion. Kelsier\ncaught her and kept her from falling to the ground.\nVin stumbled and righted herself. Across the street, the coin—now\nreleased from her control—plinked to the ground.\n“What happened?” Kelsier asked her.\nShe shook her head. “I don’t know. I Pushed on the coin, and it flew\naway. But when it hit the wall, I was pushed away.”\n“Why?”\nVin frowned thoughtfully. “I guess . . . I guess the coin couldn’t go\nanywhere, so I had to be the one that moved.”\nKelsier nodded approvingly. “Consequences, Vin. You use your own\nweight when you Steelpush. If you’re a lot heavier than your anchor, it will\nfly away from you like that coin did. However, if the object is heavier than\nyou are—or if it runs into something that is—you’ll be Pushed away.\nIronpulling is similar—either you’ll be Pulled toward the object or it will be\nPulled toward you. If your weights are similar, then you’ll both move.\n“This is the great art of Allomancy, Vin. Knowing how much, or how\nlittle, you will move when you burn steel or iron will give you a major\nadvantage over your opponents. You’ll find that these two are the most\nversatile and useful of your abilities.”\nVin nodded.\n“Now, remember,” he continued. “In both cases, the force of your Push\nor Pull is directly away from or toward you. You can’t flip things around\nwith your mind, controlling them to go wherever you want. That’s not the\nway that Allomancy works, because that’s not the way the physical world\nworks. When you push against something—whether with Allomancy or\nwith your hands—it goes directly in the opposite direction. Force, reactions,\nconsequences. Understand?”\nVin nodded again.\n“Good,” Kelsier said happily. “Now, let’s go jump over that wall.”\n“What?”\nHe left her standing dumbfounded in the street. She watched him\napproach the base of the wall, then scurried over to him.\n“You’re insane!” she said quietly."

She watched him\napproach the base of the wall, then scurried over to him.\n“You’re insane!” she said quietly.\nKelsier smiled. “I think that’s the second time today you’ve said that to\nme. You need to pay better attention—if you’d been listening to everyone\nelse, you’d know that my sanity departed long ago.”\n“Kelsier,” she said, looking up at the wall. “I can’t. . . . I mean, I’ve never\nreally even used Allomancy before this evening!”\n“Yes, but you’re such a quick learner,” Kelsier said, pulling something\nout from beneath his cloak. It appeared to be a belt. “Here, put this on. It’s\ngot metal weights strapped to it. If something goes wrong, I’ll probably be\nable to catch you.”\n“Probably?” Vin asked nervously, strapping on the belt.\nKelsier smiled, then dropped a large metal ingot at his feet. “Put the ingot\ndirectly below you, and remember to Steel-push, not Ironpull. Don’t stop\nPushing until you reach the top of the wall.”\nThen he bent down and jumped.\nKelsier shot into the air, his dark form vanishing into the curling mists.\nVin waited for a moment, but he didn’t plummet back down to his doom.\nAll was still, even to her enhanced ears. The mists whirled playfully\naround her. Taunting her. Daring her.\nShe glanced down at the ingot, burning steel. The blue line glowed with a\nfaint, ghostly light. She stepped over to the ingot, standing with one foot on\neither side of it. She glanced up at the mists, then down one last time.\nFinally, she took a deep breath and Pushed against the ingot with all of\nher strength.\n“He shall defend their ways, yet shall violate them. He will be their savior, yet they shall call him heretic. His name shall be Discord, yet they shall love him for it.”\n8\nV She suppressed a scream, remembering to continue Pushing\nIN SHOT INTO THE AIR.\ndespite her fear. The stone wall was a blur of motion just a few feet away\nfrom her. The ground disappeared below, and the line of blue pointing\ntoward the ingot grew fainter and fainter.\nWhat happens if it disappears?\nShe began to slow. The fainter the line grew, the more her speed\ndecreased. After just a few moments of flight, she crept to a halt—and was\nleft hanging in the air above a nearly invisible blue line.\n“I’ve always liked the view from up here.”\nVin glanced to the side. Kelsier stood a short distance away; she had been\nso focused that she hadn’t noticed that she was hovering just a few feet\nfrom the top of the wall.\n“Help!” she said, continuing to Push desperately, lest she fall. The mists\nbelow her shifted and spun, like some dark ocean of damned souls.\n“You don’t have to worry too much,” Kelsier said. “It’s easier to balance\nin the air if you have a tripod of anchors, but you can do fine with a single\nanchor. Your body is used to balancing itself. Part of what you’ve been"

Part of what you’ve been\ndoing since you learned to walk transfers to Allomancy. As long as you stay\nstill, hanging at the very edge of your Pushing ability, you’ll be pretty stable\n—your mind and body will correct any slight deviations from the base\ncenter of your anchor below, keeping you from falling to the sides.\n“If you were to Push on something else, or move too much to one side,\nthough . . . well, you’d lose your anchor below, and wouldn’t be pushing\ndirectly up anymore. Then you’d have problems—you’d tip over like a lead\nweight on the top of a very tall pole.”\n“Kelsier . . .” Vin said.\n“I hope you aren’t afraid of heights, Vin,” Kelsier said. “That’s quite a\ndisadvantage for a Mistborn.”\n“I’m . . . not . . . afraid . . . of . . . heights,” Vin said through gritted teeth.\n“But I’m also not accustomed to hanging in the air a hundred feet above the\nbloody street!”\nKelsier chuckled, but Vin felt a force tug against her belt, pulling her\nthrough the air toward him. He grabbed her and pulled her up over the stone\nrailing, then set her down beside him. He reached an arm over the side of\nthe wall. A second later, the ingot shot up through the air, scraping along the\nside of the wall, until it flipped into his waiting hand.\n“Good job,” he said. “Now we go back down.” He tossed the ingot over\nhis shoulder, casting it into the dark mists on the other side of the wall.\n“We’re really going outside?” Vin asked. “Outside the city walls? At\nnight?”\nKelsier smiled in that infuriating way of his. He walked over and climbed\nonto the battlements. “Varying the strength with which you Push or Pull is\ndifficult, but possible. It’s better to just fall a bit, then Push to slow yourself.\nLet go and fall some more, then Push again. If you get the rhythm right,\nyou’ll reach the ground just fine.”\n“Kelsier,” Vin said, approaching the wall. “I don’t . . .”\n“You’re at the top of the city wall now, Vin,” he said, stepping out into\nthe air. He hung, hovering, balanced as he’d explained to her before. “There\nare only two ways down. Either you jump off, or you try and explain to that\nguard patrol why a Mistborn needs to use their stairwell.”\nVin turned with concern, noting an approaching bob of lanternlight in the\ndark mists.\nShe turned back to Kelsier, but he was gone. She cursed, bending over\nthe side of the wall and looking down into the mists. She could hear the\nguards behind her, speaking softly to one another as they walked along the\nwall.\nKelsier was right: She didn’t have many options. Angry, she climbed up\nonto the battlement. She wasn’t afraid of heights in particular, but who\nwouldn’t be apprehensive, standing atop the wall, looking down at her\ndoom? Vin’s heart fluttered, her stomach twisting."

Vin’s heart fluttered, her stomach twisting.\nI hope Kelsier’s out of the way, she thought, checking the blue line to\nmake certain she was above the ingot. Then, she stepped off.\nShe immediately began to plummet toward the ground. She Pushed\nreflexively with her steel, but her trajectory was off; she had fallen to the\nside of the ingot, not directly toward it. Consequently, her Push nudged her\nto the side even farther, and she began to tumble through the air.\nAlarmed, she Pushed again—harder this time, flaring her steel. The\nsudden effort launched her back upward. She arced sideways through the\nair, popping up into the air alongside the walltop. The passing guards spun\nwith surprise, but their faces soon became indistinct as Vin fell back down\ntoward the ground.\nMind muddled by terror, she reflexively reached out and Pulled against\nthe ingot, trying to yank herself toward it. And, of course, it obediently shot\nup toward her.\nI’m dead.\nThen her body lurched, pulled upward by the belt. Her descent slowed\nuntil she was drifting quietly through the air. Kelsier appeared in the mists,\nstanding on the ground beneath her; he was—of course—smiling.\nHe let her drop the last few feet, catching her, then setting her upright on\nthe soft earth. She stood quivering for a moment, breathing in terse, anxious\nbreaths.\n“Well, that was fun,” Kelsier said lightly.\nVin didn’t respond.\nKelsier sat down on a nearby rock, obviously giving her time to gather\nher wits. Eventually, she burned pewter, using the sensation of solidness it\nprovided to steady her nerves.\n“You did well,” Kelsier said.\n“I nearly died.”\n“Everybody does, their first time,” Kelsier said. “Ironpulling and\nSteelpushing are dangerous skills. You can impale yourself with a bit of\nmetal that you Pull into your own body, you can jump and leave your\nanchor too far behind, or you can make a dozen other mistakes.\n“My experience—limited though it is—has been that it’s better to get into\nthose extreme circumstances early, when someone can watch over you.\nAnyway, I assume you can understand why it’s important for an Allomancer\nto carry as little metal on their body as possible.”\nVin nodded, then paused, reaching up to her ear. “My earring,” she said.\n“I’ll have to stop wearing it.”\n“Does it have a clip on the back?” Kelsier asked.\nVin shook her head. “It’s just a small stud, and the pin on the back bends\ndown.”\n“Then you’ll be all right,” Kelsier said. “Metal in your body—even if\nonly a bit of it is in your body—can’t be Pushed or Pulled. Otherwise\nanother Allomancer could rip the metals out of your stomach while you\nwere burning them.”\nGood to know, Vin thought.\n“It’s also why those Inquisitors can walk around so confidently with a\npair of steel spikes sticking out of their heads.

The metal pierces their\nbodies, so it can’t be affected by another Allomancer. Keep the earring—it’s\nsmall, so you won’t be able to do much with it, but you could use it as a\nweapon in an emergency.”\n“All right.”\n“Now, you ready to go?”\nShe looked up at the wall, preparing to jump again, then nodded.\n“We’re not going back up,” Kelsier said. “Come on.”\nVin frowned as Kelsier began to walk out into the mists. So, does he have\na destination after all—or has he just decided to wander some more?\nOddly, his affable nonchalance made him very difficult to read.\nVin hurried to keep up, not wanting to be left alone in the mists. The\nlandscape around Luthadel was barren save for scrub and weeds. Prickles\nand dried leaves—both dusted with ash from an earlier ashfall—rubbed\nagainst her legs as they walked. The underbrush crunched as they walked,\nquiet and a bit sodden with mist dew.\nOccasionally, they passed heaps of ash that had been carted out of the\ncity. Most of the time, however, ash was thrown into the River Channerel,\nwhich passed through the city. Water broke it down eventually—or, at least,\nthat was what Vin assumed. Otherwise the entire continent would have been\nburied long ago.\nVin stayed close to Kelsier as they walked. Though she had traveled\noutside cities before, she had always moved as part of a group of boatmen\n—the skaa workers who ran narrow-boats and barges up and down the\nmany canal routes in the Final Empire. It had been hard work—most\nnoblemen used skaa instead of horses to pull the boats along the towpath—\nbut there had been a certain freedom to knowing that she was traveling at\nall, for most skaa, even skaa thieves, never left their plantation or town.\nThe constant movement from city to city had been Reen’s choice; he had\nbeen obsessive about never getting locked down. He usually got them\nplaces on canal boats run by underground crews, never staying in one place\nfor more than a year. He had kept moving, always going. As if running from\nsomething.\nThey continued to walk. At night, even the barren hills and scrub-covered\nplains took on a forbidding air. Vin didn’t speak, though she tried to make\nas little noise as possible. She had heard tales of what went abroad in the\nland at night, and the cover of the mists—even pierced by tin as it now was\n—made her feel as if she were being watched.\nThe sensation grew more unnerving as they traveled. Soon, she began to\nhear noises in the darkness. They were muffled and faint—crackles of\nweeds, shuffles in the echoing mist.\nYou’re just being paranoid! she told herself as she jumped at some half-\nimagined sound. Eventually, however, she could stand it no more.\n“Kelsier!” she said with an urgent whisper—one that sounded\nbetrayingly loud to her enhanced ears. “I think there’s something out there.”\n“Hum?” Kelsier asked. He looked lost in his thoughts."

He looked lost in his thoughts.\n“I think something is following us!”\n“Oh,” Kelsier said. “Yes, you’re right. It’s a mistwraith.”\nVin stopped dead in her tracks. Kelsier, however, kept going.\n“Kelsier!” she said, causing him to pause. “You mean they’re real?”\n“Of course they are,” Kelsier said. “Where do you think all the stories\ncame from?”\nVin stood in dumbfounded shock.\n“You want to go look at it?” Kelsier asked.\n“Look at the mistwraith?” Vin asked. “Are you—” She stopped.\nKelsier chuckled, strolling back to her. “Mistwraiths might be a bit\ndisturbing to look at, but they’re relatively harmless. They’re scavengers,\nmostly. Come on.”\nHe began to retrace their footsteps, waving her to follow. Reluctant—but\nmorbidly curious—Vin followed. Kelsier walked at a brisk pace, leading\nher to the top of a relatively scrub-free hill. He crouched down, motioning\nfor Vin to do likewise.\n“Their hearing isn’t very good,” he said as she knelt in the rough, ashen\ndirt beside him. “But their sense of smell—or, rather, taste—is quite acute.\nIt’s probably following our trail, hoping that we’ll discard something\nedible.”\nVin squinted in the darkness. “I can’t see it,” she said, searching the mists\nfor a shadowed figure.\n“There,” Kelsier said, pointing toward a squat hill.\nVin frowned, imagining a creature crouching atop the hill, watching her\nas she looked for it.\nThen the hill moved.\nVin jumped slightly. The dark mound—perhaps ten feet tall and twice as\nlong—lurched forward in a strange, shuffling gait, and Vin leaned forward,\ntrying to get a better look.\n“Flare your tin,” Kelsier suggested.\nVin nodded, calling upon a burst of extra Allomantic power. Everything\nimmediately became lighter, the mists becoming even less of an\nobstruction.\nWhat she saw caused her to shiver—fascinated, revolted, and more than a\nlittle disturbed. The creature had smoky, translucent skin, and Vin could see\nits bones. It had dozens upon dozens of limbs, and each one looked as if it\nhad come from a different animal. There were human hands, bovine hooves,\ncanine haunches, and others she couldn’t identify.\nThe mismatched limbs let the creature walk—though it was more of a\nshamble. It crawled along slowly, moving like an awkward centipede. Many\nof the limbs, in fact, didn’t even look functional—they jutted from the\ncreature’s flesh in a twisted, unnatural fashion.\nIts body was bulbous and elongated. It wasn’t just a blob, though . . .\nthere was a strange logic to its form. It had a distinct skeletal structure, and\n—squinting through tin-enhanced eyes—she thought she could make out\ntranslucent muscles and sinew wrapping the bones. The creature flexed odd"

The creature flexed odd\njumbles of muscles as it moved, and appeared to have a dozen different rib\ncages. Along the main body, arms and legs hung at unnerving angles.\nAnd heads—she counted six. Despite the translucent skin, she could\nmake out a horse head sitting beside that of a deer. Another head turned\ntoward her, and she could see its human skull. The head sat atop a long\nspinal cord attached to some kind of animal torso, which was in turn\nattached to a jumble of strange bones.\nVin nearly retched. “What . . .? How . . .?”\n“Mistwraiths have malleable bodies,” Kelsier said. “They can shape their\nskin around any skeletal structure, and can even re-create muscles and\norgans if they have a model to mimic.”\n“You mean . . .?”\nKelsier nodded. “When they find a corpse, they envelop it and slowly\ndigest the muscles and organs. Then, they use what they’ve eaten as a\npattern, creating an exact duplicate of the dead creature. They rearrange the\nparts a little bit—excreting the bones they don’t want, while adding the\nones they do want to their body—forming a jumble like what you see out\nthere.”\nVin watched the creature shamble across the field, following her tracks. A\nflap of slimy skin drooped from its underbelly, trailing along the ground.\nTasting for scents, Vin thought. Following the smell of our passing. She let\nher tin return to normal, and the mistwraith once again became a shadowed\nmound. The silhouette, however, only seemed to heighten its abnormality.\n“Are they intelligent, then?” Vin asked. “If they can split up a . . . body\nand put the pieces where they want?”\n“Intelligent?” Kelsier asked. “No, not one this young. More instinctual\nthan intelligent.”\nVin shivered again. “Do people know about these things? I mean, other\nthan the legends?”\n“What do you mean by ‘people’?” Kelsier asked. “A lot of Allomancers\nknow about them, and I’m sure the Ministry does. Regular people . . . well,\nthey just don’t go out at night. Most skaa fear and curse mistwraiths, but go\ntheir entire lives without actually seeing one.”\n“Lucky for them,” Vin muttered. “Why doesn’t someone do something\nabout these things?”\nKelsier shrugged. “They’re not that dangerous.”\n“That one has a human head!”\n“It probably found a corpse,” Kelsier said. “I’ve never heard of a\nmistwraith attacking a full-grown, healthy adult. That’s probably why\neveryone leaves them alone. And, of course, the high nobility have devised\ntheir own uses for the creatures.”\nVin looked at him questioningly, but he said no more, rising and walking\ndown the hillside. She shot one more glance at the unnatural creature, then\ntook off, following Kelsier.\n“Is that what you brought me out here to see?” Vin asked.\nKelsier chuckled. “Mistwraiths might look eerie, but they’re hardly worth\nsuch a long trip. No, we’re heading over there.”"

No, we’re heading over there.”\nShe followed his gesture, and was able to make out a change in the\nlandscape ahead. “The imperial highroad? We’ve circled around to the front\nof the city.”\nKelsier nodded. After a short walk—during which Vin glanced backward\nno less than three times to make certain the mistwraith hadn’t gained on\nthem—they left the scrub and stepped onto the flat, packed earth of the\nimperial highroad. Kelsier paused, scanning the road in either direction. Vin\nfrowned, wondering what he was doing.\nThen she saw the carriage. It was parked by the side of the highroad, and\nVin could see that there was a man waiting beside it.\n“Ho, Sazed,” Kelsier said, walking forward.\nThe man bowed. “Master Kelsier,” he said, his smooth voice carrying\nwell in the night air. It had a higher pitch to it, and he spoke with an almost\nmelodic accent. “I almost thought that you had decided not to come.”\n“You know me, Saze,” Kelsier said, jovially slapping the man on the\nshoulder. “I’m the soul of punctuality.” He turned and waved a hand toward\nVin. “This apprehensive little creature is Vin.”\n“Ah, yes,” Sazed said, speaking in a slow, well-enunciated way. There\nwas something strange about his accent. Vin approached cautiously,\nstudying the man. Sazed had a long, flat face and a willowy body. He was\neven taller than Kelsier—tall enough to be a bit abnormal—and his arms\nwere unusually long.\n“You’re a Terrisman,” Vin said. His earlobes had been stretched out, and\nthe ears themselves contained studs that ran around their perimeter. He\nwore the lavish, colorful robes of a Terris steward—the garments were\nmade of embroidered, overlapping V shapes, alternating among the three\ncolors of his master’s house.\n“Yes, child,” Sazed said, bowing. “Have you known many of my\npeople?”\n“None,” Vin said. “But I know that the high nobility prefer Terrismen\nstewards and attendants.”\n“Indeed they do, child,” Sazed said. He turned to Kelsier. “We should go,\nMaster Kelsier. It is late, and we are still an hour away from Fellise.”\nFellise, Vin thought. So, we’re going to see the impostor Lord Renoux.\nSazed opened the carriage door for them, then closed it after they\nclimbed in. Vin settled on one of the plush seats as she heard Sazed climb\natop the vehicle and set the horses in motion.\nKelsier sat quietly in the carriage. The window shades were closed against\nthe mist, and a small lantern, half shielded, hung in the corner. Vin rode on\nthe seat directly across from him—her legs tucked up underneath her, her\nenveloping mistcloak pulled close, hiding her arms and legs.\nShe always does that, Kelsier thought. Wherever she is, she tries to be as\nsmall and unnoticeable as possible. So tense. Vin didn’t sit, she crouched."

Even when she was sitting in the open, she\nseemed to be trying to hide.\nShe’s a brave one, though. During his own training, Kelsier hadn’t been\nquite so willing to throw himself off of a city wall—old Gemmel had been\nforced to push him.\nVin watched him with those quiet, dark eyes of hers. When she noticed\nhis attention, she glanced away, huddling down a little more within her\ncloak. Unexpectedly, however, she spoke.\n“Your brother,” she said in her soft near-whisper of a voice. “You two\ndon’t get along very well.”\nKelsier raised an eyebrow. “No. We never have, really. It’s a shame. We\nshould, but we just . . . don’t.”\n“He’s older than you?”\nKelsier nodded.\n“Did he beat you often?” Vin asked.\nKelsier frowned. “Beat me? No, he didn’t beat me at all.”\n“You stopped him, then?” Vin said. “Maybe that’s why he doesn’t like\nyou. How did you escape? Did you run, or were you just stronger than\nhim?”\n“Vin, Marsh never tried to beat me. We argued, true—but we never really\nwanted to hurt one another.”\nVin didn’t contradict him, but he could see in her eyes that she didn’t\nbelieve him.\nWhat a life . . . Kelsier thought, falling silent. There were so many\nchildren like Vin in the underground. Of course, most died before reaching\nher age. Kelsier had been one of the lucky ones: His mother had been a\nresourceful mistress of a high nobleman, a clever woman who had managed\nto hide the fact that she was skaa from her lord. Kelsier and Marsh had\ngrown up privileged—considered illegitimate, but still noble—until their\nfather had finally discovered the truth.\n“Why did you teach me those things?” Vin asked, interrupting his\nthoughts. “About Allomancy, I mean.”\nKelsier frowned. “I promised you that I would.”\n“Now that I know your secrets, what is to keep me from running away\nfrom you?”\n“Nothing,” Kelsier said.\nOnce again, her distrusting glare told him that she didn’t believe his\nanswer. “There are metals you didn’t tell me about. Back in our meeting on\nthe first day, you said there were ten.”\nKelsier nodded, leaning forward. “There are. But I didn’t leave the last\ntwo out because I wanted to keep things from you. They’re just . . . difficult\nto get used to. It will be easier if you practice with the basic metals first.\nHowever, if you want to know about the last two, I can teach you once we\narrive in Fellise.”\nVin’s eyes narrowed.\nKelsier rolled his eyes. “I’m not trying to trick you, Vin. People serve on\nmy crews because they want to, and I’m effective because they can rely on\none another. No distrust, no betrayals.”\n“Except one,” Vin whispered. “The betrayal that sent you to the Pits.”"

That wasn’t what he\nwanted to do—he wanted to scratch his scars, the ones that ran all along his\nfingers and hands, twisting up his arms toward his shoulders. He resisted.\n“That isn’t something worth talking about,” he said.\n“But there was a traitor,” Vin said.\n“We don’t know for certain.” That sounded weak, even to him.\n“Regardless, my crews rely on trust. That means no coercions. If you want\nout, we can go back to Luthadel right now. I’ll show you the last two\nmetals, then you can be on your way.”\n“I don’t have enough money to survive on my own,” Vin said.\nKelsier reached inside of his cloak and pulled out a bag of coins, then\ntossed it onto the seat beside her. “Three thousand boxings. The money I\ntook from Camon.”\nVin glanced at the bag distrustfully.\n“Take it,” Kelsier said. “You’re the one who earned it—from what I’ve\nbeen able to gather, your Allomancy was behind most of Camon’s recent\nsuccesses, and you were the one who risked Pushing the emotions of an\nobligator.”\nVin didn’t move.\nFine, Kelsier thought, reaching up and knocking on the underside of the\ncoachman’s chair. The carriage stopped, and Sazed soon appeared at his\nwindow.\n“Turn the carriage around please, Saze,” Kelsier said. “Take us back to\nLuthadel.”\n“Yes, Master Kelsier.”\nWithin moments, the carriage was rolling back in the direction it had\ncome. Vin watched in silence, but she seemed a little less certain of herself.\nShe eyed the bag of coins.\n“I’m serious, Vin,” Kelsier said. “I can’t have someone on my team who\ndoesn’t want to work with me. Turning you away isn’t a punishment; it’s\njust the way things must be.”\nVin didn’t respond. Letting her go would be a gamble—but forcing her to\nstay would be a bigger one. Kelsier sat, trying to read her, trying to\nunderstand her. Would she betray them to the Final Empire if she left? He\nthought not. She wasn’t a bad person.\nShe just thought that everybody else was.\n“I think your plan is crazy,” she said quietly.\n“So do half the people on the crew.”\n“You can’t defeat the Final Empire.”\n“We don’t have to,” Kelsier said. “We just have to get Yeden an army,\nthen seize the palace.”\n“The Lord Ruler will stop you,” Vin said. “You can’t beat him—he’s\nimmortal.”\n“We have the Eleventh Metal,” Kelsier said. “We’ll find a way to kill\nhim.”\n“The Ministry is too powerful. They’ll find your army and destroy it.”\nKelsier leaned forward, looking Vin in the eye. “You trusted me enough\nto jump off the top of the wall, and I caught you. You’re going to have to"

You’re going to have to\ntrust me this time too.”\nShe obviously didn’t like the word “trust” very much. She studied him in\nthe weak lanternlight, remaining quiet long enough that the silence grew\nuncomfortable.\nFinally, she snatched the bag of coins, quickly hiding it beneath her\ncloak. “I’ll stay,” she said. “But not because I trust you.”\nKelsier raised an eyebrow. “Why, then?”\nVin shrugged, and she sounded perfectly honest when she spoke.\n“Because I want to see what happens.”\nHaving a keep in Luthadel qualified a house for high noble status. However,\nhaving a keep didn’t mean that one had to live in it, especially not all of the\ntime. Many families also maintained a residence in one of Luthadel’s\noutskirt cities.\nLess crowded, cleaner, and less strict in its observance of imperial laws,\nFellise was a rich town. Rather than containing imposing, buttressed keeps,\nit was filled with lavish manors and villas. Trees even lined some of the\nstreets; most of them were aspens, whose bone-white bark was somehow\nresistant to the discoloring of the ash.\nVin watched the mist-cloaked city through her window, the carriage\nlantern extinguished at her request. Burning tin, she was able to study the\nneatly organized and well-groomed streets. This was a section of Fellise she\nhad rarely seen; despite the town’s opulence, its slums were remarkably\nsimilar to the ones in every other city.\nKelsier watched the city through his own window, frowning.\n“You disapprove of the waste,” Vin guessed, her voice a whisper. The\nsound would carry to Kelsier’s enhanced ears. “You see the riches of this\ncity and think of the skaa who worked to create it.”\n“That’s part of it,” Kelsier said, his own voice barely a whisper. “There’s\nmore, though. Considering the amount of money spent on it, this city should\nbe beautiful.”\nVin cocked her head. “It is.”\nKelsier shook his head. “The homes are still stained black. The soil is\nstill arid and lifeless. The trees still grow leaves of brown.”\n“Of course they’re brown. What else would they be?”\n“Green,” Kelsier said. “Everything should be green.”\nGreen? Vin thought. What a strange thought. She tried to imagine trees\nwith green leaves, but the image seemed silly. Kelsier certainly had his\nquirks—though, anyone who had spent so long at the Pits of Hathsin was\nbound to be left a bit strange.\nHe turned back toward her. “Before I forget, there are a couple more\nthings you should know about Allomancy.”\nVin nodded.\n“First,” Kelsier said, “remember to burn away any unused metals you\nhave inside of you at the end of the night. Some of the metals we use can be\npoisonous if digested; it’s best not to sleep with them in your stomach.”\n“All right,” Vin said.\n“Also,” Kelsier said, “never try to burn a metal that isn’t one of the ten.

Well, if you\ntry to burn a metal that isn’t Allomantically sound at all, it could be deadly.”\nVin nodded solemnly. Good to know, she thought.\n“Ah,” Kelsier said, turning back toward the window. “Here we are: the\nnewly purchased Manor Renoux. You should probably take off your cloak\n—the people here are loyal to us, but it always pays to be careful.”\nVin agreed completely. She pulled off the cloak, letting Kelsier tuck it in\nhis pack. Then she peeked out the carriage window, peering through the\nmists at the approaching manor. The grounds had a low stone wall and an\niron gate; a pair of guards opened the way as Sazed identified himself.\nThe roadway inside was lined with aspens, and atop the hill ahead Vin\ncould see a large manor house, phantom light spilling from its windows.\nSazed pulled the carriage up before the manor, then handed the reins to a\nservant and climbed down. “Welcome to Manor Renoux, Mistress Vin,” he\nsaid, opening the door and gesturing to help her down.\nVin eyed his hand, but didn’t take it, instead scrambling down on her\nown. The Terrisman didn’t seem offended by her refusal.\nThe steps to the manor house were lit by a double line of lantern poles.\nAs Kelsier hopped from the carriage, Vin could see a group of men\ngathering at the top of the white marble stairs. Kelsier climbed the steps\nwith a springy stride; Vin followed behind, noticing how clean the steps\nwere. They would have to be scrubbed regularly to keep the ash from\nstaining them. Did the skaa who maintained the building know that their\nmaster was an imposter? How was Kelsier’s “benevolent” plan to\noverthrow the Final Empire helping the common people who cleaned these\nsteps?\nThin and aging, “Lord Renoux” wore a rich suit and a pair of aristocratic\nspectacles. A sparse, gray mustache colored his lip, and—despite his age—\nhe didn’t carry a cane for support. He nodded respectfully to Kelsier, but\nmaintained a dignified air. Immediately, Vin was struck by one obvious fact:\nThis man knows what he is doing.\nCamon had been skilled at impersonating noblemen, but his self-\nimportance had always struck Vin as a bit juvenile. While there were\nnoblemen like Camon, the more impressive ones were like this Lord\nRenoux: calm, and self-confident. Men whose nobility was in their bearing\nrather than their ability to speak scornfully to those around them. Vin had to\nresist cringing when the impostor’s eyes fell on her—he seemed far too\nmuch a nobleman, and she had been trained to reflexively avoid their\nattention.\n“The manor is looking much better,” Kelsier said, shaking hands with\nRenoux.\n“Yes, I’m impressed with its progress,” Renoux said. “My cleaning crews\nare quite proficient—give us a bit more time, and the manor will be so\ngrand that I wouldn’t hesitate to host the Lord Ruler himself.”"

She didn’t like it when people\nlooked at her that way—it made her wonder how they were going to try and\nuse her.\n“We will need to speak further of this, Kelsier,” Renoux said, nodding\ntoward the mansion’s entrance. “The hour is late, but . . .”\nKelsier stepped into the building. “Late? Why, it’s barely midnight. Have\nyour people prepare some food—Lady Vin and I missed dinner.”\nA missed meal was nothing new to Vin. However, Renoux immediately\nwaved to some servants, and they leapt into motion. Renoux walked into\nthe building, and Vin followed. She paused in the entryway, however, Sazed\nwaiting patiently behind her.\nKelsier paused, turning when he noticed that she wasn’t following.\n“Vin?”\n“It’s so . . . clean,” Vin said, unable to think of any other description. On\njobs, she’d occasionally seen the homes of noblemen. However, those times\nhad happened at night, in dark gloom. She was unprepared for the well-lit\nsight before her.\nThe white marble floors of Manor Renoux seemed to glow, reflecting the\nlight of a dozen lanterns. Everything was . . . pristine. The walls were white\nexcept where they had been wash-painted with traditional animal murals. A\nbrilliant chandelier sparkled above a double staircase, and the room’s other\ndecorations—crystal sculptures, vases set with bundles of aspen branches—\nglistened, unmarred by soot, smudge, or fingerprint.\nKelsier chuckled. “Well, her reaction speaks highly of your efforts,” he\nsaid to Lord Renoux.\nVin allowed herself to be led into the building. The group turned right,\nentering a room whose whites were muted slightly by the addition of\nmaroon furnishings and drapes.\nRenoux paused. “Perhaps the lady could enjoy some refreshment here for\na moment,” he said to Kelsier. “There are some matters of a . . . delicate\nnature that I would discuss with you.”\nKelsier shrugged. “Fine with me,” he said, following Renoux toward\nanother doorway. “Saze, why don’t you keep Vin company while Lord\nRenoux and I talk?”\n“Of course, Master Kelsier.”\nKelsier smiled, eyeing Vin, and somehow she knew that he was leaving\nSazed behind to keep her from eavesdropping.\nShe shot the departing men an annoyed look. What was that you said\nabout “trust,” Kelsier? However, she was even more annoyed at herself for\ngetting unsettled. Why should she care if Kelsier excluded her? She had\nspent her entire life being ignored and dismissed. It had never bothered her\nbefore when other crewleaders left her out of their planning sessions.\nVin took a seat in one of the stiffly upholstered maroon chairs, tucking\nher feet up beneath her.

Kelsier had been\nshowing her too much respect, making her feel too important. She was\nbeginning to think that she deserved to be part of his secret confidences.\nReen’s laughter in the back of her mind discredited those thoughts, and she\nsat, annoyed at both herself and Kelsier, feeling ashamed, but not exactly\ncertain why.\nRenoux’s servants brought her a platter of fruits and breads. They set up a\nsmall stand beside her chair, and even gave her a crystalline cup filled with\na glistening red liquid. She couldn’t tell if it was wine or juice, and she\ndidn’t intend to find out. She did, however, pick at the food—her instincts\nwouldn’t let her pass up a free meal, even if it was prepared by unfamiliar\nhands.\nSazed walked over and took a position standing just behind her chair to\nthe right. He waited with a stiff posture, hands clasped in front of him, eyes\nforward. The stance was obviously intended to be respectful, but his\nlooming posture didn’t help her mood any.\nVin tried to focus on her surroundings, but this only reminded her of how\nrich the furnishings were. She was uncomfortable amid such finery; she felt\nas if she stood out like a black spot on a clean rug. She didn’t eat the breads\nfor fear that she would drop crumbs on the floor, and she worried at her feet\nand legs—which had been stained with ash while walking through the\ncountryside—marring the furnishings.\nAll of this cleanliness came at some skaa’s expense, Vin thought. Why\nshould I worry about disturbing it? However, she had trouble feeling\noutraged, for she knew this was only a front. “Lord Renoux” had to\nmaintain a certain level of finery. It would be suspicious to do otherwise.\nIn addition, something else kept her from resenting the waste. The\nservants were happy. They went about their duties with a businesslike\nprofessionalism, no sense of drudgery about their efforts. She heard\nlaughter in the outer hallway. These were not mistreated skaa; whether they\nhad been included in Kelsier’s plans or not was irrelevant.\nSo, Vin sat and forced herself to eat fruit, yawning occasionally. It was\nturning out to be a long night indeed. The servants eventually left her alone,\nthough Sazed continued to loom just behind her.\nI can’t eat like this, she finally thought with frustration. “Could you not\nstand over my shoulder like that?”\nSazed nodded. He took two steps forward so that he stood next to her\nchair, rather than behind it. He adopted the same stiff posture, looming\nabove her just as he had before.\nVin frowned in annoyance, then noticed the smile on Sazed’s lips. He\nglanced down at her, eyes twinkling at his joke, then walked over and\nseated himself in the chair beside hers.\n“I’ve never known a Terrisman with a sense of humor before,” Vin said\ndryly.\nSazed raised an eyebrow. “I was under the impression that you hadn’t\nknown any Terrismen at all, Mistress Vin.”\nVin paused. “Well, I’ve never heard of one with a sense of humor.

You’re\nsupposed to be completely rigid and formal.”\n“We’re just subtle, Mistress,” Sazed said. Though he sat with a stiff\nposture, there was still something . . . relaxed about him. It was as if he\nwere as comfortable when sitting properly as other people were when\nlounging.\nThat’s how they’re supposed to be. The perfect serving men, completely\nloyal to the Final Empire.\n“Is something troubling you, Mistress Vin?” Sazed asked as she studied\nhim.\nHow much does he know? Perhaps he doesn’t even realize that Renoux is\nan imposter. “I was just wondering how you . . . came here,” she finally\nsaid.\n“You mean, how did a Terrisman steward end up as part of a rebellion\nintending to overthrow the Final Empire?” Sazed asked in his soft voice.\nVin flushed. Apparently he was well versed indeed.\n“That is an intriguing question, Mistress,” Sazed said. “Certainly, my\nsituation is not common. I would say that I arrived at it because of belief.”\n“Belief?”\n“Yes,” Sazed said. “Tell me, Mistress. What is it that you believe?”\nVin frowned. “What kind of question is that?”\n“The most important kind, I think.”\nVin sat for a moment, but he obviously expected a reply, so she finally\nshrugged. “I don’t know.”\n“People often say that,” Sazed said, “but I find that it is rarely true. Do\nyou believe in the Final Empire?”\n“I believe that it is strong,” Vin said.\n“Immortal?”\nVin shrugged. “It has been so far.”\n“And the Lord Ruler? Is he the Ascended Avatar of God? Do you believe\nthat he, as the Ministry teaches, is a Sliver of Infinity?”\n“I . . . I’ve never thought about it before.”\n“Perhaps you should,” Sazed said. “If, upon examination, you find that\nthe Ministry’s teachings do not suit you, then I would be pleased to offer\nyou an alternative.”\n“What alternative?”\nSazed smiled. “That depends. The right belief is like a good cloak, I\nthink. If it fits you well, it keeps you warm and safe. The wrong fit,\nhowever, can suffocate.”\nVin paused, frowning slightly, but Sazed just smiled. Eventually, she\nturned her attention back to her meal. After a short wait, the side door\nopened, and Kelsier and Renoux returned.\n“Now,” Renoux said as he and Kelsier seated themselves, a group of\nservants bringing another plate of food for Kelsier, “let us discuss this child.\nThe man you were going to have play my heir will not do, you say?”\n“Unfortunately,” Kelsier said, making quick work of his food.\n“That complicates things greatly,” Renoux said.\nKelsier shrugged. “We’ll just have Vin be your heir.”\nRenoux shook his head. “A girl her age could inherit, but it would be\nsuspicious for me to pick her.

There are any number of legitimate male\ncousins in the Renoux line who would be far more suitable choices. It was\ngoing to be difficult enough to get a middle-aged man past courtly scrutiny.\nA young girl . . . no, too many people would investigate her background.\nOur forged family lines will survive passing scrutiny, but if someone were\nto actually send messengers to search out her holdings . . .”\nKelsier frowned.\n“Besides,” Renoux added. “There is another issue. If I were to name a\nyoung, unmarried girl as my heir, hers would instantly become one of the\nmost sought-after hands in Luthadel. It would be very difficult for her to\nspy if she were to receive that much attention.”\nVin flushed at the thought. Surprisingly, she found her heart sinking as\nthe old imposter spoke. This was the only part Kelsier gave me in the plan.\nIf I can’t do it, what good am I to the crew?\n“So, what do you suggest?” Kelsier asked.\n“Well, she doesn’t have to be my heir,” Renoux said. “What if, instead,\nshe were simply a young scion I brought with me to Luthadel? Perhaps I\npromised her parents—distant but favored cousins—that I would introduce\ntheir daughter to the court? Everyone would assume that my ulterior motive\nis to marry her off to a high noble family, thereby gaining myself another\nconnection to those in power. However, she wouldn’t draw much attention\n—she would be of low status, not to mention somewhat rural.”\n“Which would explain why she’s a bit less refined than other court\nmembers,” Kelsier said. “No offense, Vin.”\nVin looked up from hiding a piece of napkin-wrapped bread in her shirt\npocket. “Why would I be offended?”\nKelsier smiled. “Never mind.”\nRenoux nodded to himself. “Yes, this will work much better. Everyone\nassumes that House Renoux will eventually join the high nobility, so they’ll\naccept Vin into their ranks out of courtesy. However, she herself will be\nunimportant enough that most people will ignore her. That is the ideal\nsituation for what we will want her to do.”\n“I like it,” Kelsier said. “Few people expect a man of your age and\nmercantile concerns to bother himself with balls and parties, but having a\nyoung socialite to send instead of a rejection note will serve as an advantage\nto your reputation.”\n“Indeed,” Renoux said. “She’ll need some refinement, however—and not\njust in appearance.”\nVin squirmed a bit beneath their scrutiny. It looked as if her part in the\nplan would go forward, and she suddenly realized what that meant. Being\naround Renoux made her uncomfortable—and he was a fake nobleman.\nHow would she react to an entire room full of real ones?\n“I’m afraid I’ll have to borrow Sazed from you for a while,” Kelsier said.\n“Quite all right,” Renoux said. “He’s really not my steward, but yours.”\n“Actually,” Kelsier said, “I don’t think he’s anybody’s steward anymore,\neh Saze?”\nSazed cocked his head. “A Terrisman without a master is like a soldier"

Vin needs some\ncoaching, and I know plenty of high noblemen who are less refined than\nyourself. Do you think you could help the girl prepare?”\n“I am certain that I could offer the young lady some aid,” Sazed said.\n“Good,” Kelsier said, popping one last cake in his mouth, then rising.\n“I’m glad that’s settled, because I’m starting to feel tired—and poor Vin\nlooks like she’s about to nod off in the middle of her fruit plate.”\n“I’m fine,” Vin said immediately, the assertion weakened slightly by a\nstifled yawn.\n“Sazed,” Renoux said, “would you show them to the appropriate guest\nchambers?”\n“Of course, Master Renoux,” Sazed said, rising from his seat in a smooth\nmotion.\nVin and Kelsier trailed the tall Terrisman from the room as a group of\nservants took away the remnants of the meal. I left food behind, Vin noticed,\nfeeling a bit drowsy. She wasn’t certain what to think of the occurrence.\nAs they crested the stairs and turned into a side hallway, Kelsier fell into\nplace beside Vin. “I’m sorry for excluding you back there, Vin.”\nShe shrugged. “There’s no reason for me to know all of your plans.”\n“Nonsense,” Kelsier said. “Your decision tonight makes you as much a\npart of this team as anyone else. Renoux’s words in private, however, were\nof a personal nature. He is a marvelous actor, but he feels very\nuncomfortable with people knowing the specifics of how he took Lord\nRenoux’s place. I promise you, nothing we discussed has any bearing on\nyour part in the plan.”\nVin continued walking. “I . . . believe you.”\n“Good,” Kelsier said with a smile, clapping her on the shoulder. “Saze, I\nknow my way to the men’s guest quarters—I was, after all, the one who\nbought this place. I can make my way from here.”\n“Very well, Master Kelsier,” Sazed said with a respectful nod. Kelsier\nshot Vin a smile, then turned down a hallway, walking with his\ncharacteristically lively step.\nVin watched him go, then followed Sazed down a different side passage,\npondering the Allomancy training, her discussion with Kelsier in the\ncarriage, and finally Kelsier’s promise just a few moments before. The three\nthousand boxings—a fortune in coins—was a strange weight tied to her\nbelt.\nEventually, Sazed opened a particular door for her, walking in to light the\nlanterns. “The linens are fresh, and I will send maids to prepare you a bath\nin the morning.” He turned, handing her his candle. “Will you require\nanything else?”"

She burned pewter with a flash and hit the\nground running, dashing along Fellise’s quiet streets. The late-autumn air\nwas cool, but winters were generally mild in the Central Dominance.

I’m smaller, I weigh less, and I have a shorter reach than anyone\nI’m likely to fight. If I attack someone head on, I’ll lose.\nThe alternative had always been her method anyway—to struggle quietly,\nto stay unseen. She had to learn to use Allomancy the same way. Kelsier\nkept saying that she was developing amazingly fast as an Allomancer. He\nseemed to think it was his teaching, but Vin felt it was something else. The\nmists . . . the night prowling . . . it all felt right to her. She was not worried\nabout mastering Allomancy in time to help Kelsier against other Mistborn.\nIt was her other part in the plan that worried her.\nSighing, Vin hopped over the wall to search for her coin pouch. Up at the\nmansion—not Renoux’s home, but one owned by some other nobleman—\nlights were on and people milled about. None of them ventured deeply into\nthe night. The skaa would fear mistwraiths; the nobility would have guessed\nthat Mistborn had caused the disturbance. Neither one was something a\nsane person would want to confront.\nVin eventually traced her pouch by steel-line to the upper branches of a\ntree. She Pulled it slightly, tugging it down into her hand, then made her\nway back out to the street. Kelsier probably would have left the pouch\nbehind—the two dozen or so clips it contained wouldn’t have been worth\nhis time. However, for most of her life Vin had scrounged and starved. She\njust couldn’t force herself to be wasteful. Even tossing coins to jump with\nmade her uncomfortable.\nSo, she used her coins sparingly as she traveled back toward Renoux’s\nmansion, instead Pushing and Pulling off of buildings and discarded bits of\nmetal. The half-jumping, half-running gait of a Mistborn came naturally to\nher now, and she didn’t have to think much about her movements.\nHow would she fare, trying to pretend to be a noblewoman? She couldn’t\nhide her apprehensions, not from herself. Camon had been good at imitating\nnoblemen because of his self-confidence, and that was one attribute Vin\nknew she didn’t have. Her success with Allomancy only proved that her\nplace was in corners and shadows, not striding around in pretty dresses at\ncourtly balls.\nKelsier, however, refused to let her back out. Vin landed in a crouch just\noutside Mansion Renoux, puffing slightly from exertion. She regarded the\nlights with a slight feeling of apprehension.\nYou’ve got to learn to do this, Vin, Kelsier kept telling her. You’re a\ntalented Allomancer, but you’ll need more than Steel-pushes to succeed\nagainst the nobility. Until you can move in their society as easily as you do\nin the mists, you’ll be at a disadvantage.\nLetting out a quiet sigh, Vin rose from her crouch, then took off her\nmistcloak and stuffed it away for later retrieval.

When she asked after Sazed, the mansion\nservants directed her to the kitchens, so she made her way into the closed-\noff, hidden section of the mansion that was the servants’ quarters.\nEven these parts of the building were kept immaculately clean. Vin was\nbeginning to understand why Renoux made such a convincing impostor: He\ndidn’t allow for imperfection. If he maintained his impersonation half as\nwell as he maintained order in his mansion, then Vin doubted anyone would\never discover the ruse.\nBut, she thought, he must have some flaw. Back in the meeting two\nmonths ago, Kelsier said that Renoux wouldn’t be able to withstand scrutiny\nby an Inquisitor. Perhaps they’d be able to sense something about his\nemotions, something that gives him away?\nIt was a small item, but Vin had not forgotten it. Despite Kelsier’s words\nabout honesty and trust, he still had his secrets. Everyone did.\nSazed was, indeed, to be found in the kitchens. He stood with a middle-\naged servant. She was tall for a skaa woman—though standing next to\nSazed made her look diminutive. Vin recognized her as a member of the\nmansion staff; Cosahn was her name. Vin had made an effort to memorize\nall of the names of the local staff, if only to keep tabs on them.\nSazed looked over as Vin entered. “Ah, Mistress Vin. Your return is quite\ntimely.” He gestured to his companion. “This is Cosahn.”\nCosahn studied Vin with a businesslike air. Vin longed to return to the\nmists, where people couldn’t look at her like that.\n“It is long enough now, I think,” Sazed said.\n“Probably,” Cosahn said. “But I cannot perform miracles, Master Vaht.”\nSazed nodded. “Vaht” was, apparently, the proper title for a Terrisman\nsteward. Not quite skaa, but definitely not noblemen, the Terrismen held a\nvery strange place in imperial society.\nVin studied the two of them suspiciously.\n“Your hair, Mistress,” Sazed said with a calm tone. “Cosahn is going to\ncut it for you.”\n“Oh,” Vin said, reaching up. Her hair was getting a bit long for her taste\n—though somehow she doubted that Sazed was going to let her have it\ncropped boyishly short.\nCosahn waved to a chair, and Vin reluctantly seated herself. She found it\nunnerving to sit docilely while someone worked with shears so close to her\nhead, but there was no getting around it.\nAfter a few moments of running her hands through Vin’s hair, “tisk”ing\nquietly, Cosahn began to snip. “Such beautiful hair,” she said, almost as if\nto herself, “thick, with a nice deep black color. It’s a shame to see it cared\nfor so poorly, Master Vaht. Many courtly women would die for hair like this\n—it has just enough body to lie full, but is straight enough to work with\neasily.”\nSazed smiled. “We’ll have to see that it receives better care in the future,”\nhe said.\nCosahn continued her work, nodding to herself.

Eventually, Sazed\nwalked over and took a seat just a few feet in front of Vin.\n“Kelsier hasn’t returned yet, I assume?” Vin asked.\nSazed shook his head, and Vin sighed. Kelsier didn’t think she was\npracticed enough go with him on his nightly raids, many of which he went\non directly following his training sessions with Vin. During the last two\nmonths, Kelsier had put in appearances on the properties of a dozen\ndifferent noble houses, both in Luthadel and in Fellise. He varied his\ndisguises and apparent motives, trying to create an air of confusion among\nthe Great Houses.\n“What?” Vin asked, eyeing Sazed, who was regarding her with a curious\nlook.\nThe Terrisman nodded his head slightly with respect. “I was wondering if\nyou might be willing to listen to another proposal.”\nVin sighed, rolling her eyes. “Fine.” It isn’t like I can do anything else but\nsit here.\n“I think I have the perfect religion for you,” Sazed said, his normally\nstoic face revealing a glimmer of eagerness. “It is called ‘Trelagism,’ after\nthe god Trell. Trell was worshipped by a group known as the Nelazan, a\npeople who lived far to the north. In their land, the day and night cycle was\nvery odd. During some months of the year, it was dark for most of the day.\nDuring the summer, however, it only grew dark for a few hours at a time.\n“The Nelazan believed that there was beauty in darkness, and that the\ndaylight was more profane. They saw the stars as the Thousand Eyes of\nTrell watching them. The sun was the single, jealous eye of Trell’s brother,\nNalt. Since Nalt only had one eye, he made it blaze brightly to outshine his\nbrother. The Nelazan, however, were not impressed, and preferred to\nworship the quiet Trell, who watched over them even when Nalt obscured\nthe sky.”\nSazed fell silent. Vin wasn’t sure how to respond, so she didn’t say\nanything.\n“It really is a good religion, Mistress Vin,” Sazed said. “Very gentle, yet\nvery powerful. The Nelazan were not an advanced people, but they were\nquite determined. They mapped the entire night sky, counting and placing\nevery major star. Their ways suit you—especially their preference of the\nnight. I can tell you more, if you wish.”\nVin shook her head. “That’s all right, Sazed.”\n“Not a good fit, then?” Sazed said, frowning slightly. “Ah, well. I shall\nhave to consider it some more. Thank you, Mistress—you are very patient\nwith me, I think.”\n“Consider it some more?” Vin asked. “That’s the fifth religion you’ve\ntried to convert me to, Saze. How many more can there be?”\n“Five hundred and sixty two,” Sazed said. “Or, at least, that is the\nnumber of belief systems I know. There are, likely and unfortunately, others\nthat have passed from this world without leaving traces for my people to\ncollect.”"

There are, likely and unfortunately, others\nthat have passed from this world without leaving traces for my people to\ncollect.”\nVin paused. “And you have all of these religions memorized?”\n“As much as is possible,” Sazed said. “Their prayers, their beliefs, their\nmythologies. Many are very similar—breakoffs or sects of one another.”\n“Even still, how can you remember all of that?”\n“I have . . . methods,” Sazed said.\n“But, what’s the point?”\nSazed frowned. “The answer should be obvious, I think. People are\nvaluable, Mistress Vin, and so—therefore—are their beliefs. Since the\nAscension a thousand years ago, so many beliefs have disappeared. The\nSteel Ministry forbids the worship of anyone but the Lord Ruler, and the\nInquisitors have quite diligently destroyed hundreds of religions. If\nsomeone doesn’t remember them, then they will simply disappear.”\n“You mean,” Vin said incredulously, “you’re trying to get me to believe\nin religions that have been dead for a thousand years?”\nSazed nodded.\nIs everyone involved with Kelsier insane?\n“The Final Empire cannot last forever,” Sazed said quietly. “I do not\nknow if Master Kelsier will be the one who finally brings its end, but that\nend will come. And when it does—when the Steel Ministry no longer holds\nsway—men will wish to return to the beliefs of their fathers. On that day\nthey will look to the Keepers, and on that day we shall return to mankind\nhis forgotten truths.”\n“Keepers?” Vin asked as Cosahn moved around to begin snipping at her\nbangs. “There are more like you?”\n“Not many,” Sazed said. “But some. Enough to pass the truths on to the\nnext generation.”\nVin sat thoughtfully, resisting the urge to squirm beneath Cosahn’s\nministrations. The woman certainly was taking her time—when Reen had\ncut Vin’s hair, he had been finished after just a few quick hacks.\n“Shall we go over your lessons while we wait, Mistress Vin?” Sazed\nasked.\nVin eyed the Terrisman, and he smiled just slightly. He knew that he had\nher captive; she couldn’t hide, or even sit at the window, staring out into the\nmists. All she could do was sit and listen. “Fine.”\n“Can you name all ten Great Houses of Luthadel in order of power?”\n“Venture, Hasting, Elariel, Tekiel, Lekal, Erikeller, Erikell, Haught,\nUrbain, and Buvidas.”\n“Good,” Sazed said. “And you are?”\n“I am the Lady Valette Renoux, fourth cousin to Lord Teven Renoux,\nwho owns this mansion. My parents—Lord Hadren and Lady Fellette\nRenoux—live in Chakath, a city in the Western Dominance. Major export,\nwool. My family works in trading dyes, specifically blushdip red, from the\nsnails that are common there, and callowfield yellow, made from tree bark.\nAs part of a trade agreement with their distant cousin, my parents sent me\ndown here to Luthadel, so I can spend some time at court.”\nSazed nodded. “And how do you feel about this opportunity?”"

Since\nI’m not familiar with the ways of court, I will be flattered by their attention.\nI will ingratiate myself to the court community, but I will stay quiet and out\nof trouble.”\n“Your memorization skills are admirable, Mistress,” Sazed said. “This\nhumble attendant wonders how much more successful might you be if you\ndedicated yourself to learning, rather than dedicating yourself to avoiding\nour lessons.”\nVin eyed him. “Do all Terrisman ‘humble attendants’ give their masters\nas much lip as you do?”\n“Only the successful ones.”\nVin eyed him for a moment, then sighed. “I’m sorry, Saze. I don’t mean\nto avoid your lessons. I just . . . the mists . . . I get distracted sometimes.”\n“Well, fortunately and honestly, you are very quick to learn. However,\nthe people of the court have had their entire lives to study etiquette. Even as\na rural noblewoman, there are certain things you would know.”\n“I know,” Vin said. “I don’t want to stand out.”\n“Oh, you can’t avoid that, Mistress. A newcomer, from a distant part of\nthe empire? Yes, they will notice you. We just don’t want to make them\nsuspicious. You must be considered, then dismissed. If you act too much\nlike a fool, that will be suspect in and of itself.”\nGreat.\nSazed paused, cocking his head slightly. A few seconds later, Vin heard\nfootsteps in the hallway outside. Kelsier sauntered into the room, bearing a\nself-satisfied smile. He pulled off his mistcloak, then paused as he saw Vin.\n“What?” she asked, sinking a little further into the chair.\n“The haircut looks good,” Kelsier said. “Nice job, Cosahn.”\n“It was nothing, Master Kelsier.” Vin could hear the blush in her voice. “I\njust work with what I have.”\n“Mirror,” Vin said, holding out her hand.\nCosahn handed her one. Vin held it up, and what she saw gave her pause.\nShe looked . . . like a girl.\nCosahn had done a remarkable job of evening out the hair, and she had\nmanaged to get rid of the snags. Vin had always found that if her hair got\ntoo long, it had a tendency to stand up. Cosahn had done something about\nthis too. Vin’s hair still wasn’t very long—it barely hung down over her ears\n—but at least it lay flat.\nYou don’t want them to think of you as a girl, Reen’s voice warned. Yet,\nfor once, she found herself wanting to ignore that voice.\n“We might actually turn you into a lady, Vin!” Kelsier said with a laugh,\nearning him a glare from Vin.\n“First we’ll have to persuade her not to scowl so often, Master Kelsier,”\nSazed noted.\n“That’s going to be hard,” Kelsier said. “She’s quite fond of making\nfaces. Anyway, well done, Cosahn.”"

The\nhaircut really was good. However, his compliments had an ulterior motive\n—he suspected that Vin had spent far too much of her life being told that\nshe was worthless. Perhaps if she had a bit more self-confidence, she\nwouldn’t try to hide so much.\nHe let the door slide shut, turning to Sazed. The Terrisman waited, as\nalways, with restful patience.\n“How is the training going?” Kelsier asked.\n“Very well, Master Kelsier,” Sazed said. “She already knew some things\nfrom training she received at her brother’s hands. Above that, however, she\nis an extremely intelligent girl—perceptive and quick to memorize. I didn’t\nexpect such skill from one who grew up in her circumstances.”\n“A lot of the street children are clever,” Kelsier said. “The ones who\naren’t dead.”\nSazed nodded solemnly. “She is extremely reserved, and I sense that she\ndoesn’t see the full value in my lessons. She is very obedient, but is quick to\nexploit mistakes or misunderstandings. If I don’t tell her exactly when and\nwhere to meet, I often have to search the entire mansion for her.”\nKelsier nodded. “I think it’s her way of maintaining a bit of control in her\nlife. Anyway, what I really wanted to know is whether she’s ready or not.”\n“I’m not sure, Master Kelsier,” Sazed replied. “Pure knowledge is not the\nequivalent of skill. I’m not certain if she has the . . . poise to imitate a\nnoblewoman, even a young and inexperienced one. We’ve done practice\ndinners, gone over conversational etiquette, and memorized gossip. She\nseems skilled at it all, in a controlled situation. She’s even done well sitting\nin on tea meetings when Renoux entertains noble guests. However, we\nwon’t really be able to tell if she can do this until we put her alone in a party\nfull of aristocrats.”\n“I wish she could practice some more,” Kelsier said with a shake of his\nhead. “But every week we spend preparing increases the chances that the\nMinistry will discover our budding army in the caves.”\n“It is a test of balance, then,” Sazed said. “We must wait long enough to\ngather the men we need, yet move soon enough to avoid discovery.”\nKelsier nodded. “We can’t pause for one crewmember—we’ll have to\nfind someone else to be our mole if Vin does badly. Poor girl—I wish I had\ntime to train her better in Allomancy. We’ve barely covered the first four\nmetals. I just don’t have enough time!”\n“If I might make a suggestion . . .”"

Let them show Mistress Vin how to use her\nabilities.”\nKelsier paused thoughtfully. “That’s a good idea, Saze.”\n“But?”\nKelsier glanced back toward the door, beyond which Vin was still\npetulantly getting her haircut. “I’m not sure. Today, when we were training,\nwe got into a Steelpush shoving match. The kid has to weigh less than half\nwhat I do, but she gave me a decent pummeling anyway.”\n“Different people have different strengths in Allomancy,” Sazed said.\n“Yes, but the variance isn’t usually this great,” Kelsier said. “Plus, it took\nme months and months to learn how to manipulate my Pushes and Pulls.\nIt’s not as easy as it sounds—even something as simple as Pushing yourself\nup onto a rooftop requires an understanding of weight, balance, and\ntrajectory.\n“But Vin . . . she seems to know all these things instinctively. True, she\ncan only use the first four metals with any skill, but the progress she’s made\nis amazing.”\n“She is a special girl.”\nKelsier nodded. “She deserves more time to learn about her powers. I\nfeel a little guilty about pulling her into our plans. She’ll probably end up at\na Ministry execution ceremony with the rest of us.”\n“But that guilt won’t stop you from using her to spy on the aristocracy.”\nKelsier shook his head. “No,” he said quietly. “It won’t. We’ll need every\nadvantage we can get. Just . . . watch over her, Saze. From now on, you’ll\nact as Vin’s steward and guardian at the functions she attends—it won’t be\nodd for her to bring a Terrisman servant with her.”\n“Not at all,” Sazed agreed. “In fact, it would be strange to send a girl her\nage to courtly functions without an escort.”\nKelsier nodded. “Protect her, Saze. She might be a powerful Allomancer,\nbut she’s inexperienced. I’ll feel a lot less guilty about sending her into\nthose aristocratic dens if I know you’re with her.”\n“I will protect her with my life, Master Kelsier. I promise you this.”\nKelsier smiled, resting a thankful hand on Sazed’s shoulder. “I feel pity\nfor the man who gets in your way.”\nSazed bowed his head humbly. He looked innocuous, but Kelsier knew\nthe strength that Sazed hid. Few men, Allomancers or not, would fare well\nin a fight with a Keeper whose anger had been roused. That was probably\nwhy the Ministry had hunted the sect virtually to extinction.\n“All right,” Kelsier said. “Get back to your teaching.

For some reason, she found the muffled heat of a hood\npreferable to the oppressive red sunlight.\nShe walked with a slouch, eyes down, sticking near to the side of the\nstreet. The skaa she passed had similar airs of dejection. No one looked up;\nno one walked with a straight back or an optimistic smile. In the slums,\nthose things would make one look suspicious.\nShe’d almost forgotten how oppressive Luthadel could be. Her weeks in\nFellise had accustomed her to trees and washed stone. Here, there was\nnothing white—no creeping aspens, no whitewashed granite. All was black.\nBuildings were stained by countless, repetitive ashfalls. Air curled with\nsmoke from the infamous Luthadel smithies and a thousand separate noble\nkitchens. Cobblestones, doorways, and corners were clogged with soot—the\nslums were rarely swept clean.\nIt’s like . . . things are actually brighter at night than they are during the\nday, Vin thought, pulling her patched skaa cloak close, turning a corner. She\npassed beggars, huddled on corners, hands outstretched and hoping for an\noffering, their pleadings falling vainly on the ears of people who were\nthemselves starving. She passed workers, walking with heads and shoulders\nbowed, caps or hoods pulled down to keep ash out of their eyes.\nOccasionally, she passed squads of Garrison town guards, walking with full\narmor—breastplate, cap, and black cloak—trying to look as intimidating as\npossible.\nThis last group moved through the slums, acting as the Lord Ruler’s\nhands in an area most obligators found too distasteful to visit. The\nGarrisoners kicked at beggars to make certain they were truly invalids,\nstopped wandering workers to harass them about being on the streets\ninstead of working, and made a general nuisance of themselves. Vin ducked\ndown as a group passed, pulling her hood close. She was old enough that\nshe should have been either bearing children or working in a mill, but her\nsize often made her look younger in profile.\nEither the ruse worked, or this particular squad wasn’t interested in\nlooking for ditchers, for they let her pass with barely a glance.

As she approached the far wall,\nshe could see a splintery wooden door set in the room’s corner. A man\nseated by the door caught her eyes, nodded slightly, and pushed the door\nopen.

He seemed quite pleased with\nhimself.\n“So, did you Push him?” she asked.\nBreeze shook his head. “Waste of brass.

It’s about the delicate and\nnoble art of manipulation.”\n“Noble indeed,” Vin said.\n“Ah, you sound like one of them,” Breeze said.\n“Them who?”\n“Them everyone else,” Breeze said. “You saw how that skaa gentleman\ntreated me? People don’t like us, my dear. The idea of someone who can\nplay with their emotions, who can ‘mystically’ get them to do certain things,\nmakes them uncomfortable. What they do not realize—and what you must\nrealize—is that manipulating others is something that all people do. In fact,\nmanipulation is at the core of our social interaction.”\nHe settled back, raising his dueling cane and gesturing with it slightly as\nhe spoke. “Think about it. What is a man doing when he seeks the affection\nof a young lady? Why, he is trying to manipulate her to regard him\nfavorably. What happens when old two friends sit down for a drink? They\ntell stories, trying to impress each other. Life as a human being is about\nposturing and influence. This isn’t a bad thing—in fact, we depend upon it.\nThese interactions teach us how to respond to others.”\nHe paused, pointing at Vin with the cane. “The difference between\nSoothers and regular people is that we are aware of what we’re doing. We\nalso have a slight . . . advantage. But, is it really that much more ‘powerful’\nthan having a charismatic personality or a fine set of teeth? I think not.”\nVin paused.\n“Besides,” Breeze added, “as I mentioned, a good Soother must be\nskilled far beyond his ability to use Allomancy. Allomancy can’t let you\nread minds or even emotions—in a way, you’re as blind as anyone else. You\nfire off pulses of emotions, targeted at a single person or in an area, and\nyour subjects will have their emotions altered—hopefully producing the\neffect that you wished. However, great Soothers are those who can\nsuccessfully use their eyes and instincts to know how a person is feeling\nbefore they get Soothed.”\n“What does it matter how they’re feeling?” Vin said, trying to cover her\nannoyance. “You’re just going to Soothe them anyway, right? So, when\nyou’re done, they’ll feel how you want them to.”\nBreeze sighed, shaking his head. “What would you say if you knew I’d\nSoothed you on three separate occasions during our conversation?”\nVin paused. “When?” she demanded.\n“Does it matter?” Breeze asked. “This is the lesson you must learn, my\ndear. If you can’t read how someone is feeling, then you’ll never have a\nsubtle touch with emotional Allomancy. Push someone too hard, and even\nthe most blind of skaa will realize that they’re being manipulated somehow.\nTouch too softly, and you won’t produce a noticeable effect—other, more\npowerful emotions will still rule your subject.”"

That, my dear, is the challenge in what\nwe do! It is difficult, but for those who can do it well . . .”\nThe door opened, and the sullen skaa man returned, bearing an entire\nbottle of wine. He put it and a cup on the table before Breeze, then went\nover to stand on the other side of the room, beside peepholes looking into\nthe dining room.\n“There are vast rewards,” Breeze said with a quiet smile. He winked at\nher, then poured some wine.\nVin wasn’t certain what to think. Breeze’s opinion seemed cruel. Yet,\nReen had trained her well. If she didn’t have power over this thing, others\nwould gain power over her through it. She started burning copper—as\nKelsier had taught her—to shield herself from further manipulations on\nBreeze’s part.\nThe door opened again, and a familiar vest-wearing form tromped in.\n“Hey, Vin,” Ham said with a friendly wave. He walked over to the table,\neyeing the wine. “Breeze, you know that the rebellion doesn’t have the\nmoney for that kind of thing.”\n“Kelsier will reimburse them,” Breeze said with a dismissive wave. “I\nsimply cannot work with a dry throat. How is the area?”\n“Secure,” Ham said. “But I’ve got Tineyes on the corners just in case.\nYour bolt-exit is behind that hatch in the corner.”\nBreeze nodded, and Ham turned, looking at Clubs’s apprentice. “You\nSmoking back there, Cobble?”\nThe boy nodded.\n“Good lad,” Ham said. “That’s everything, then. Now we just have to\nwait for Kell’s speech.”\nBreeze checked his pocket watch. “He’s not scheduled for another few\nminutes. Shall I have someone fetch you a cup?”\n“I’ll pass,” Ham said.\nBreeze shrugged, sipping his wine.\nThere was a moment of silence. Finally, Ham spoke. “So . . .”\n“No,” Breeze interrupted.\n“But—”\n“Whatever it is, we don’t want to hear about it.”\nHam gave the Soother a flat stare. “You can’t Push me into complacence,\nBreeze.”\nBreeze rolled his eyes, taking a drink.\n“What?” Vin asked. “What were you going to say?”\n“Don’t encourage him, my dear,” Breeze said.\nVin frowned. She glanced at Ham, who smiled.\nBreeze sighed. “Just leave me out of it. I’m not in the mood for one of\nHam’s inane debates.”\n“Ignore him,” Ham said eagerly, pulling his chair a little bit closer to Vin.\n“So, I’ve been wondering. By overthrowing the Final Empire are we doing\nsomething good, or are we doing something bad?”\nVin paused. “Does it matter?”\nHam looked taken aback, but Breeze chuckled. “Well answered,” the"

The Final\nEmpire has oppressed the skaa for centuries.”\n“Right,” Ham said. “But, there’s a problem. The Lord Ruler is God,\nright?”\nVin shrugged. “Does it matter?”\nHam glared at her.\nShe rolled her eyes. “All right. The Ministry claims that he is God.”\n“Actually,” Breeze noted, “the Lord Ruler is only a piece of God. He is\nthe Sliver of Infinity—not omniscient or omnipresent, but an independent\nsection of a consciousness that is.”\nHam sighed. “I thought you didn’t want to be involved.”\n“Just making certain everyone has their facts correct,” Breeze said\nlightly.\n“Anyway,” Ham said. “God is the creator of all things, right? He is the\nforce that dictates the laws of the universe, and is therefore the ultimate\nsource of ethics. He is absolute morality.”\nVin blinked.\n“You see the dilemma?” Ham asked.\n“I see an idiot,” Breeze mumbled.\n“I’m confused,” Vin said. “What’s the problem?”\n“We claim to be doing good,” Ham said. “But, the Lord Ruler—as God\n—defines what is good. So, by opposing him we’re actually evil. But, since\nhe’s doing the wrong thing, does evil actually count as good in this case?”\nVin frowned.\n“Well?” Ham asked.\n“I think you gave me a headache,” Vin said.\n“I warned you,” Breeze noted.\nHam sighed. “But, don’t you think it’s worth thinking about?”\n“I’m not sure.”\n“I am,” Breeze said.\nHam shook his head. “No one around here likes to have decent,\nintelligent discussions.”\nThe skaa rebel in the corner suddenly perked up. “Kelsier’s here!”\nHam raised an eyebrow, then stood. “I should go watch the perimeter.\nThink about that question, Vin.”\n“All right . . .” Vin said as Ham left.\n“Over here, Vin,” Breeze said, rising. “There are peepholes on the wall\nfor us. Be a dear and bring my chair over, would you?”\nBreeze didn’t look back to see if she did as requested. She paused,\nuncertain. With her copper on, he couldn’t Soothe her, but . . . Eventually,\nshe sighed and carried both chairs over to the side of the room. Breeze slid\nback a long, thin slat in the wall, revealing a view of the dining room.\nA group of dirtied skaa men sat around tables, wearing brown work coats\nor ragged cloaks. They were a dark group, with ash-stained skin and\nslumped postures. However, their presence at the meeting meant that they\nwere willing to listen. Yeden sat at a table near the front of the room,\nwearing his usual patched worker’s coat, his curly hair cut short during\nVin’s absence.\nVin had expected some kind of grand entrance from Kelsier.

Instead,\nhowever, he simply walked quietly out of the kitchen. He paused by\nYeden’s table, smiling and speaking quietly with the man for a moment,\nthen he stepped up before the seated workers.\nVin had never seen him in such mundane clothing before. He wore a\nbrown skaa coat and tan trousers, like many of the audience. Kelsier’s\noutfit, however, was clean. No soot stained the cloth, and while it was of the\nsame rough material that skaa commonly used, it bore no patches or tears.\nThe difference was stark enough, Vin decided—if he’d come in a suit, it\nwould have been too much.\nHe put his arms behind his back, and slowly the crowd of workers\nquieted. Vin frowned, watching through the peep slit, wondering at\nKelsier’s ability to quiet a room of hungry men by simply standing before\nthem. Was he using Allomancy, perhaps? Yet, even with her copper on, she\nfelt a . . . presence from him.\nOnce the room fell quiet, Kelsier began to speak. “You’ve probably all\nheard of me, by now,” he said. “And, you wouldn’t be here if you weren’t at\nleast a little bit sympathetic to my cause.”\nBeside Vin, Breeze sipped his drink. “Soothing and Rioting aren’t like\nother kinds of Allomancy,” he said quietly. “With most metals, Pushing and\nPulling have opposite effects. With emotions, however, you can often\nproduce the same result regardless of whether you Soothe or Riot.\n“This doesn’t hold for extreme emotional states—complete\nemotionlessness or utter passion. However, in most cases, it doesn’t matter\nwhich power you use. People are not like solid bricks of metal—at any\ngiven time, they will have a dozen different emotions churning within them.\nAn experienced Soother can dampen everything but the emotion he wants\nto remain dominant.”\nBreeze turned slightly. “Rudd, send in the blue server, please.”\nOne of the guards nodded, cracking the door and whispering something\nto the man outside. A moment later, Vin saw a serving girl wearing a faded\nblue dress move through the crowd, filling drinks.\n“My Soothers are mixed with the crowd,” Breeze said, his voice growing\ndistracted. “The serving girls are a sign, telling my men which emotions to\nSoothe away. They will work, just as I do. . . .” He trailed off, concentrating\nas he looked into the crowd.\n“Fatigue . . .” he whispered. “That’s not a necessary emotion right now.\nHunger . . . distracting. Suspicion . . . definitely not helpful. Yes, and as the\nSoothers work, the Rioters enflame the emotions we want the crowd to be\nfeeling. Curiosity . . . that’s what they need now. Yes, listen to Kelsier.\nYou’ve heard legends and stories. See the man for yourself, and be\nimpressed.”\n“I know why you came today,” Kelsier said quietly.

        "text": "impressed.”\n“I know why you came today,” Kelsier said quietly. He spoke without\nmuch of the flamboyance Vin associated with the man, his tone quiet, but\ndirect. “Twelve-hour days in a mill, mine, or forge. Beatings, lack of pay,\npoor food. And, for what? So that you can return to your tenements at the\nday’s end to find another tragedy? A friend, slain by an uncaring taskmaster.\nA daughter, taken to be some nobleman’s plaything. A brother, dead at the\nhand of a passing lord who was having an unpleasant day.”\n“Yes,” Breeze whispered. “Good. Red, Rudd. Send in the girl in light\nred.”\nAnother serving girl entered the room.\n“Passion and anger,” Breeze said, his voice almost a mumble. “But just a\nbit. Just a nudge—a reminder.”\nCurious, Vin extinguished her copper for a moment, burning bronze\ninstead, trying to sense Breeze’s use of Allomancy. No pulses came from\nhim.\nOf course, she thought. I forgot about Clubs’s apprentice—he’d keep me\nfrom sensing any Allomantic pulses. She turned her copper back on.\nKelsier continued to speak. “My friends, you’re not alone in your\ntragedy. There are millions, just like you. And they need you. I’ve not come\nto beg—we’ve had enough of that in our lives. I simply ask you to think.\nWhere would you rather your energy be spent? On forging the Lord Ruler’s\nweapons? Or, on something more valuable?”\nHe’s not mentioning our troops, Vin thought. Or even what those who\njoin with him are going to do. He doesn’t want the workers to know details.\nProbably a good idea—those he recruits can be sent to the army, and the\nrest won’t be able to give away specific information.\n“You know why I am here,” Kelsier said. “You know my friend, Yeden,\nand what he represents. Every skaa in the city knows about the rebellion.\nPerhaps you’ve considered joining it. Most of you will not—most of you\nwill go back to your soot-stained mills, to your burning forges, to your\ndying homes. You’ll go because this terrible life is familiar. But some of\nyou . . . some of you will come with me. And those are the men who will be\nremembered in the years to come. Remembered for having done something\ngrand.”\nMany of the workers shared glances, though some just stared at their\nhalf-empty soup bowls. Finally, someone near the back of the room spoke.\n“You’re a fool,” the man said. “The Lord Ruler will kill you. You don’t\nrebel against God in his own city.”\nThe room fell silent. Tense. Vin sat up as Breeze whispered to himself.\nIn the room, Kelsier stood quietly for a moment. Finally, he reached up\nand pulled back the sleeves on his jacket, revealing the crisscrossed scars on\nhis arms. “The Lord Ruler is not our god,” he said quietly. “And he cannot\nkill me. He tried, but he failed. For I am the thing that he can never kill.”\nWith that, Kelsier turned, walking from the room the way he had come."

        "text": "kill me. He tried, but he failed. For I am the thing that he can never kill.”\nWith that, Kelsier turned, walking from the room the way he had come.\n“Hum,” Breeze said, “well, that was a little dramatic. Rudd, bring back\nthe red and send out the brown.”\nA serving woman in brown walked into the crowd.\n“Amazement,” Breeze said. “And, yes, pride. Soothe the anger, for now. .\n. .”\nThe crowd sat quietly for a moment, the dining room eerily motionless.\nFinally, Yeden stood up to speak and give some further encouragement, as\nwell as an explanation of what the men should do, should they wish to hear\nmore. As he talked, the men returned to their meals.\n“Green, Rudd,” Breeze said. “Hum, yes. Let’s make you all thoughtful,\nand give you a nudge of loyalty. We wouldn’t want anyone to run to the\nobligators, would we? Kell’s covered his tracks quite well, but the less the\nauthorities hear, the better, eh? Oh, and what about you, Yeden? You’re a bit\ntoo nervous. Let’s Soothe that, take away your worries. Leave only that\npassion of yours—hopefully, it will be enough to cover up that stupid tone\nin your voice.”\nVin continued to watch. Now that Kelsier had gone, she found it easier to\nfocus on the crowd’s reactions, and on Breeze’s work. As Yeden spoke, the\nworkers outside seemed to react exactly according to Breeze’s mumbled\ninstructions. Yeden, too, showed effects of the Soothing: He grew more\ncomfortable, his voice more confident, as he spoke.\nCurious, Vin let her copper drop again. She concentrated, seeing if she\ncould sense Breeze’s touch on her emotions; she would be included in his\ngeneral Allomantic projections. He didn’t have time to pick and choose\nindividuals, except maybe Yeden. It was very, very difficult to sense. Yet, as\nBreeze sat mumbling to himself, she began to feel the exact emotions he\ndescribed.\nVin couldn’t help but be impressed. The few times that Kelsier had used\nAllomancy on her emotions, his touch has been like a sudden, blunt punch\nto the face. He had strength, but very little subtlety.\nBreeze’s touch was incredibly delicate. He Soothed certain emotions,\ndampening them while leaving others unaffected. Vin thought she could\nsense his men Rioting on her emotions, too, but these touches weren’t\nnearly as subtle as Breeze’s. She left her copper off, watching for touches\non her emotions as Yeden continued his speech. He explained that the men\nwho joined with them would have to leave family and friends for a time—\nas long as a year—but would be fed well during that time.\nVin felt her respect for Breeze continue to rise. Suddenly, she didn’t feel\nso annoyed with Kelsier for handing her off. Breeze could only do one\nthing, but he obviously had a great deal of practice at it. Kelsier, as a\nMistborn, had to learn all of the Allomantic skills; it made sense that he\nwouldn’t be as focused in any one power."

Men, we are preparing for\nsomething grand. Something that may, indeed, end up being our last\nstruggle against the Final Empire. Join with us. Join with your brothers.\nJoin with the Survivor himself!”\nThe dining room fell silent.\n“Bright red,” Breeze said. “I want those men to leave feeling passionate\nabout what they’ve heard.”\n“The emotions will fade, won’t they?” Vin said as a red-clothed serving\ngirl entered the crowd.\n“Yes,” Breeze said, sitting back and sliding the panel closed. “But\nmemories stay. If people associate strong emotion with an event, they’ll\nremember it better.”\nA few moments later, Ham entered through the back door. “That went\nwell. The men are leaving invigorated, and a number of them are staying\nbehind. We’ll have a good set of volunteers to send off to the caves.”\nBreeze shook his head. “It’s not enough. Dox takes a few days to\norganize each of these meetings, and we only get about twenty men from\neach one. At this rate, we’ll never hit ten thousand in time.”\n“You think we need more meetings?” Ham asked. “That’s going to be\ntough—we have to be very careful with these things, so only those who can\nbe reasonably trusted are invited.”\nBreeze sat for a moment. Finally, he downed the rest of his wine. “I don’t\nknow—but we’ll have to think of something. For now, let’s return to the\nshop. I believe Kelsier wishes to hold a progress meeting this evening.”\nKelsier looked to the west. The afternoon sun was a poisonous red, shining\nangrily through a sky of smoke. Just below it, Kelsier could see the\nsilhouetted tip of a dark peak. Tyrian, closest of the Ashmounts.\nHe stood atop Clubs’s flat-roofed shop, listening to workers returning\nhome on the streets below. A flat roof meant having to shovel off ash\noccasionally, which was why most skaa buildings were peaked, but in\nKelsier’s opinion the view was often worth a bit of trouble.\nBelow him, the skaa workers trudged in despondent ranks, their passing\nkicking up a small cloud of ash. Kelsier turned away from them, looking\ntoward the northern horizon . . . toward the Pits of Hathsin.\nWhere does it go? he thought. The atium reaches the city, but then\ndisappears. It isn’t the Ministry—we’ve watched them—and no skaa hands\ntouch the metal. We assume it goes into the treasury. We hope it does, at\nleast.\nWhile burning atium, a Mistborn was virtually unstoppable, which was\npart of why it was so valuable. But, his plan was about more than just"

He knew how much atium was harvested at the pits, and Dockson\nhad researched the amounts that the Lord Ruler doled out—at exorbitant\nprices—to the nobility. Barely a tenth of what was mined eventually found\nits way into noble hands.\nNinety percent of the atium produced in the world had been stockpiled,\nyear after year, for a thousand years. With that much of the metal, Kelsier’s\nteam could intimidate even the most powerful of the noble houses. Yeden’s\nplan to hold the palace probably seemed futile to many—indeed, on its\nown, it was doomed to fail. However, Kelsier’s other plans . . .\nKelsier glanced down at the small, whitish bar in his hand. The Eleventh\nMetal. He knew the rumors about it—he’d started them. Now, he just had to\nmake good on them.\nHe sighed, turning eyes east, toward Kredik Shaw, the Lord Ruler’s\npalace. The name was Terris; it meant “The Hill of a Thousand Spires.”\nAppropriate, since the imperial palace resembled a patch of enormous black\nspears thrust into the ground. Some of the spires twisted, others were\nstraight. Some were thick towers, others were thin and needlelike. They\nvaried in height, but each one was tall. And each one ended in a point.\nKredik Shaw. That’s where it had ended three years before. And he\nneeded to go back.\nThe trapdoor opened, and a figure climbed onto the roof. Kelsier turned\nwith a raised eyebrow as Sazed brushed off his robe, then approached in his\ncharacteristically respectful posture. Even a rebellious Terrisman\nmaintained the form of his training.\n“Master Kelsier,” Sazed said with a bow.\nKelsier nodded, and Sazed stepped up beside him, looking toward the\nimperial palace. “Ah,” he said to himself, as if understanding Kelsier’s\nthoughts.\nKelsier smiled. Sazed had been a valuable find indeed. Keepers were\nnecessarily secretive, for the Lord Ruler had hunted them practically since\nthe Day of Ascension itself. Some legends claimed that the Ruler’s\ncomplete subjugation of the Terris people—including the breeding and\nstewardship programs—was simply an outgrowth of his hatred for Keepers.\n“I wonder what he would think if he knew a Keeper was in Luthadel,”\nKelsier said, “barely a short walk from the palace itself.”\n“Let us hope we never find out, Master Kelsier,” Sazed said.\n“I appreciate your willingness to come here to the city, Saze. I know it’s a\nrisk.”\n“This is a good work,” Sazed said. “And this plan is dangerous for all\ninvolved. Indeed, simply living is dangerous for me, I think. It is not\nhealthy to belong to a sect that the Lord Ruler himself fears.”\n“Fears?” Kelsier asked, turning to look up at Sazed. Despite Kelsier’s\nabove-average height, the Terrisman was still a good head taller. “I’m not\nsure if he fears anything, Saze.”"

Perhaps\nit is because of our powers. We are not Allomancers, but . . . something else.\nSomething unknown to him.”\nKelsier nodded, turning back toward the city. He had so many plans, so\nmuch work to do—and at the core of it all were the skaa. The poor, humble,\ndefeated skaa.\n“Tell me about another one, Saze,” Kelsier said. “One with power.”\n“Power?” Sazed asked. “That is a relative term when applied to religion,\nI think. Perhaps you would like to hear of Jaism. Its followers were quite\nfaithful and devout.”\n“Tell me about them.”\n“Jaism was founded by a single man,” Sazed said. “His true name is lost,\nthough his followers simply called him ‘the Ja.’ He was murdered by a local\nking for preaching discord—something he was apparently very good at—\nbut that only made his following larger.\n“The Jaists thought that they earned happiness proportional to their overt\ndevotion, and were known for frequent and fervent professions of faith.\nApparently, speaking with a Jaist could be frustrating, since they tended to\nend nearly every sentence with ‘Praise the Ja.’ ”\n“That’s nice, Saze,” Kelsier said. “But power is more than just words.”\n“Oh, quite indeed,” Sazed agreed. “The Jaists were strong in their faith.\nLegends say that the Ministry had to wipe them out completely, since not\none Jaist would accept the Lord Ruler as God. They didn’t last long past the\nAscension, but only because they were so blatant that they were easy to\nhunt down and kill.”\nKelsier nodded, then he smiled, eyeing Sazed. “You didn’t ask me if I\nwanted to convert.”\n“My apologies, Master Kelsier,” Sazed said, “but the religion does not\nsuit you, I think. It has a level of brashness that you might find appealing,\nbut you would find the theology simplistic.”\n“You’re getting to know me too well,” Kelsier said, still regarding the\ncity. “In the end, after kingdoms and armies had fallen, the religions were\nstill fighting, weren’t they?”\n“Indeed,” Sazed said. “Some of the more resilient religions lasted all the\nway until the fifth century.”\n“What made them so strong?” Kelsier said. “How did they do it, Saze?\nWhat gave these theologies such power over people?”\n“It wasn’t any one thing, I think,” Sazed said. “Some were strong through\nhonest faith, others because of the hope they promised. Others were\ncoercive.”\n“But they all had passion,” Kelsier said.\n“Yes, Master Kelsier,” Sazed said with a nod. “That is a quite true\nstatement.”\n“That’s what we’ve lost,” Kelsier said, looking over the city with its\nhundreds of thousands, barely a handful of whom would dare fight. “They\ndon’t have faith in the Lord Ruler, they simply fear him. They don’t have\nanything left to believe in.”\n“What do you believe in, if I may ask, Master Kelsier?”"

The teenage boy approached and crouched beside her chair.\n“Marsh,” Vin whispered beneath the general hum of the room. “Is that a\nnickname?”\n“Notting without the call of his parents.”\nVin paused, trying to decipher the boy’s eastern dialect. “Not a nickname,\nthen?”\nLestibournes shook his head. “He wasing one though.”\n“What was it?”\n“Ironeyes. Others stopped using it. Too calling close to an iron in the real\neyes, eh? Inquisitor.”\nVin glanced at Marsh again. His expression was hard, his eyes\nunwavering, almost like they were made of iron. She could see why people\nwould stop using the nickname; even referring to a Steel Inquisitor made\nher shiver.\n“Thanks.”\nLestibournes smiled. He was an earnest boy. Strange, intense, and jumpy\n—but earnest. He retreated to his stool as Kelsier finally arrived.\n“All right, crew,” he said. “What’ve we got?”\n“Besides the bad news?” Breeze asked.\n“Let’s hear it.”\n“It’s been twelve weeks, and we’ve gathered under two thousand men,”\nHam said. “Even with the numbers the rebellion already has, we’re going to\nfall short.”\n“Dox?” Kelsier asked. “Can we get more meetings?”\n“Probably,” Dockson said from his seat beside a table stacked with\nledgers.\n“Are you sure you want to take that risk, Kelsier?” Yeden asked. His\nattitude had improved during the last few weeks—especially once Kelsier’s\nrecruits had begun to file in. As Reen had always said, results made quick\nfriends.\n“We’re already in danger,” Yeden continued. “Rumors are all over the\nunderground. If we make any more of a stir, the Ministry is going to realize\nthat something major is happening.”\n“He’s probably right, Kell,” Dockson said. “Besides, there are only so"

If we make any more of a stir, the Ministry is going to realize\nthat something major is happening.”\n“He’s probably right, Kell,” Dockson said. “Besides, there are only so\nmany skaa willing to listen. Luthadel is big, true, but our movement here is\nlimited.”\n“All right,” Kelsier said. “So, we’ll start working the other towns in the\narea. Breeze, can you split your crew into two effective groups?”\n“I suppose,” Breeze said hesitantly.\n“We can have one team work in Luthadel and the other work in\nsurrounding towns. I can probably make it to all of the meetings, assuming\nwe organize them so they don’t happen at the same time.”\n“That many meetings will expose us even more,” Yeden said.\n“And that, by the way, brings up another problem,” Ham said. “Weren’t\nwe supposed to be working on infiltrating the Ministry’s ranks?”\n“Well?” Kelsier asked, turning to Marsh.\nMarsh shook his head. “The Ministry is tight—I need more time.”\n“It’s not going to happen,” Clubs grumbled. “Rebellion’s already tried\nit.”\nYeden nodded. “We’ve tried to get spies into the Inner Ministries a dozen\ntimes. It’s impossible.”\nThe room fell silent.\n“I have an idea,” Vin said quietly.\nKelsier raised an eyebrow.\n“Camon,” she said. “He was working on a job before you recruited me.\nActually, it was the job that got us spotted by the obligators. The core of\nthat plan was organized by another thief, a crewleader named Theron. He\nwas setting up a fake canal convoy to carry Ministry funds to Luthadel.”\n“And?” Breeze asked.\n“Those same canal boats would have brought new Ministry acolytes to\nLuthadel for the final part of their training. Theron has a contact along the\nroute, a lesser obligator who was open to bribes. Maybe we could get him\nto add an ‘acolyte’ to the group from his local chapter.”\nKelsier nodded thoughtfully. “It’s worth looking into.”\nDockson scribbled something on a sheet with his fountain pen. “I’ll\ncontact Theron and see if his informant is still viable.”\n“How are our resources coming?” Kelsier asked.\nDockson shrugged. “Ham found us two ex-soldier instructors. The\nweapons, however . . . well, Renoux and I are making contacts and\ninitiating deals, but we can’t move very quickly. Fortunately, when the\nweapons come, they should come in bulk.”\nKelsier nodded. “That’s everything, right?”\nBreeze cleared his throat. “I’ve . . . been hearing a lot of rumors on the\nstreets, Kelsier,” he said. “The people are talking about this Eleventh Metal\nof yours.”\n“Good,” Kelsier said.\n“Aren’t you worried that the Lord Ruler will hear? If he has forewarning\nof what you’re going to do, it will be much more difficult to . . . resist him.”\nHe didn’t say “kill,” Vin thought. They don’t think that Kelsier can do it.\nKelsier just smiled. “Don’t worry about the Lord Ruler—I’ve got things"

Are you insa . . .” Yeden trailed off, then glanced at the rest of the\nroom. “Right. I forgot.”\n“He’s catching on,” Dockson noted.\nHeavy footsteps sounded in the hallway, and one of Ham’s guards\nentered a moment later. He made his way to Ham’s chair and whispered a\nbrief message.\nHam frowned.\n“What?” Kelsier asked.\n“An incident,” Ham said.\n“Incident?” Dockson asked. “What kind of incident?”\n“You know that lair we met in a few weeks back?” Ham said. “The one\nwhere Kell first introduced his plan?”\nCamon’s lair, Vin thought, growing apprehensive.\n“Well,” Ham said, “apparently the Ministry found it.”\nIt seems Rashek represents a growing faction in Terris culture. A large number of the youths think that their unusual powers should be used for more than just fieldwork,\nhusbandry, and stonecarving. They are rowdy, even violent—far different from the quiet, discerning Terris philosophers and holy men that I have known.\nThey will have to be watched carefully, these Terrismen. They could be very dangerous, if given the opportunity and the motivation.\n11\nK , blocking Vin’s view. She stooped down, trying to peek\nELSIER PAUSED IN THE DOORWAY\npast him into the lair, but too many people were in the way. She could only\ntell that the door hung at an angle, splintered, the upper hinge torn free.\nKelsier stood for a long moment. Finally, he turned, looking past\nDockson toward her. “Ham is right, Vin. You may not want to see this.”\nVin stood where she was, looking at him resolutely. Finally, Kelsier\nsighed, stepping into the room. Dockson followed, and Vin could finally see\nwhat they had been blocking.\nThe floor was scattered with corpses, their twisted limbs shadowed and\nhaunting in the light of Dockson’s solitary lantern. They weren’t rotting yet\n—the attack had happened only that morning—but there was still a smell of\ndeath about the room. The scent of blood drying slowly, the scent of misery\nand of terror.\nVin remained in the doorway. She’d seen death before—seen it often, on\nthe streets. Knifings in alleys. Beatings in lairs. Children dead of starvation.\nShe had once seen an old woman’s neck snapped by the backhand of an\nannoyed lord. The body had lain in the street for three days before a skaa\ncorpse crew had finally come for it.\nYet, none of those incidents had the same air of intentional butchery that\nshe saw in Camon’s lair. These men hadn’t simply been killed, they had\nbeen torn apart. Limbs lay separated from torsos. Broken chairs and tables\nimpaled chests. There were only a few patches of floor that were not\ncovered in sticky, dark blood."

There were only a few patches of floor that were not\ncovered in sticky, dark blood.\nKelsier glanced at her, obviously expecting some sort of reaction. She\nstood, looking over the death, feeling . . . numb. What should her reaction\nbe? These were the men who had mistreated her, stolen from her, beaten\nher. And yet, these were the men who had sheltered her, included her, and\nfed her when others might have simply given her to the whoremasters.\nReen probably would have berated her for the traitorous sadness she felt\nat the sight. Of course, he had always been angry when—as a child—she’d\ncried as they left one town for another, not wanting to leave the people\nshe’d grown to know, no matter how cruel or indifferent they were.\nApparently, she hadn’t quite gotten over that weakness. She stepped into the\nroom, not shedding any tears for these men, yet at the same time wishing\nthat they had not come to such an end.\nIn addition, the gore itself was disturbing. She tried to force herself to\nmaintain a stiff face in front of the others, but she found herself cringing\noccasionally, glancing away from mangled corpses. The ones who had\nperformed the attack had been quite . . . thorough.\nThis seems extreme, even for the Ministry, she thought. What kind of\nperson would do something like this?\n“Inquisitor,” Dockson said quietly, kneeling by a corpse.\nKelsier nodded. Behind Vin, Sazed stepped into the room, careful to keep\nhis robes clear of the blood. Vin turned toward the Terrisman, letting his\nactions distract her from a particularly grisly corpse. Kelsier was a\nMistborn, and Dockson was supposedly a capable warrior. Ham and his\nmen were securing the area. However, others—Breeze, Yeden, and Clubs—\nhad stayed behind. The area was too dangerous. Kelsier had even resisted\nVin’s desire to come.\nYet, he had brought Sazed without apparent hesitation. The move, subtle\nthough it was, made Vin regard the steward with a new curiosity. Why\nwould it be too dangerous for Mistings, yet safe enough for a Terrisman\nsteward? Was Sazed a warrior? How would he have learned to fight?\nTerrismen were supposedly raised from birth by very careful trainers.\nSazed’s smooth step and calm face gave her few clues. He didn’t appear\nshocked by the carnage, however.\nInteresting, Vin thought, picking her way through shattered furniture,\nstepping clear of blood pools, making her way to Kelsier’s side. He\ncrouched beside a pair of corpses. One, Vin noticed in a moment of shock,\nhad been Ulef. The boy’s face was contorted and pained, the front of his\nchest a mass of broken bones and ripped flesh—as if someone had forcibly\ntorn the rib cage apart with his hands. Vin shivered, looking away.\n“This isn’t good,” Kelsier said quietly. “Steel Inquisitors don’t generally\nbother with simple thieving crews. Usually, the obligators would just come\ndown with their troops and take everyone captive, then use them to make a\ngood show on an execution day. An Inquisitor would only get involved if it"

An Inquisitor would only get involved if it\nhad a special interest in the crew.”\n“You think . . .” Vin said. “You think it might be the same one as\nbefore?”\nKelsier nodded. “There are only about twenty Steel Inquisitors in the\nwhole of the Final Empire, and half of them are out of Luthadel at any\ngiven time. I find it too much of a coincidence that you would catch one’s\ninterest, escape, and then have your old lair get hit.”\nVin stood quietly, forcing herself to look down at Ulef’s body and\nconfront her sorrow. He had betrayed her in the end, but for a time he had\nalmost been a friend.\n“So,” she said quietly, “the Inquisitor still has my scent?”\nKelsier nodded, standing.\n“Then this is my fault,” Vin said. “Ulef and the others . . .”\n“It was Camon’s fault,” Kelsier said firmly. “He’s the one who tried to\nscam an obligator.” He paused, then looked over at her. “You going to be all\nright?”\nVin looked up from Ulef’s mangled corpse, trying to remain strong. She\nshrugged. “None of them were my friends.”\n“That’s kind of coldhearted, Vin.”\n“I know,” she said with a quiet nod.\nKelsier regarded her for a moment, then crossed the room to speak with\nDockson.\nVin looked back at Ulef’s wounds. They looked like the work of some\ncrazed animal, not a single man.\nThe Inquisitor must have had help, Vin told herself. There is no way one\nperson, even an Inquisitor, could have done all this. There was a pileup of\nbodies near the bolt exit, but a quick count told her that most—if not all—of\nthe crew was accounted for. One man couldn’t have gotten to all of them\nquickly enough . . . could he have?\nThere are a lot of things we don’t know about the Inquisitors, Kelsier had\ntold her. They don’t quite follow the normal rules.\nVin shivered again.\nFootsteps sounded on the stairs, and Vin grew tense, crouching and\npreparing to run.\nHam’s familiar figure appeared in the stairwell. “Area’s secure,” he said,\nholding up a second lantern. “No sign of obligators or Garrisoners.”\n“That’s their style,” Kelsier said. “They want the massacre to be\ndiscovered—they left the dead as a sign.”\nThe room fell silent save for a low mumbling from Sazed, who stood at\nthe far left side of the room. Vin picked her way over to him, listening to the\nrhythmic cadence of his voice. Eventually, he stopped speaking, then bowed\nhis head and closed his eyes.\n“What was that?” Vin asked as he looked up again.\n“A prayer,” Sazed said. “A death chant of the Cazzi. It is meant to\nawaken the spirits of the dead and entice them free from their flesh so that\nthey may return to the mountain of souls.” He glanced at her. “I can teach\nyou of the religion, if you wish, Mistress.

The Cazzi were an interesting\npeople—very familiar with death.”\nVin shook her head. “Not right now. You said their prayer—is this the\nreligion you believe in, then?”\n“I believe in them all.”\nVin frowned. “None of them contradict each other?”\nSazed smiled. “Oh, often and frequently they do. But, I respect the truths\nbehind them all—and I believe in the need for each one to be remembered.”\n“Then, how did you decide which religion’s prayer to use?” Vin asked.\n“It just seemed . . . appropriate,” Sazed said quietly, regarding the scene\nof shadowed death.\n“Kell,” Dockson called from the back of the room. “Come look at this.”\nKelsier moved to join him, as did Vin. Dockson stood by the long\ncorridor-like chamber that had been her crew’s sleeping quarters. Vin poked\nher head inside, expecting to find a scene similar to the one in the common\nroom. Instead, there was only a single corpse tied to a chair. In the weak\nlight she could barely make out that his eyes had been gouged out.\nKelsier stood quietly for a moment. “That’s the man I put in charge.”\n“Milev,” Vin said with a nod. “What about him?”\n“He was killed slowly,” Kelsier said. “Look at the amount of blood on\nthe floor, the way his limbs are twisted. He had time to scream and\nstruggle.”\n“Torture,” Dockson said, nodding.\nVin felt a chill. She glanced up at Kelsier.\n“Shall we move our base?” Ham asked.\nKelsier slowly shook his head. “When Clubs came to this lair, he would\nhave worn a disguise to and from the meeting, hiding his limp. It’s his job\nas a Smoker to make certain that you can’t find him just by asking around\non the street. None of the people in this crew could have betrayed us—we\nshould still be safe.”\nNo one spoke the obvious. The Inquisitor shouldn’t have been able to find\nthis lair either.\nKelsier stepped back into the main room, pulling Dockson aside and\nspeaking to him in a quiet voice. Vin edged closer, trying to hear what they\nwere saying, but Sazed placed a restraining hand on her shoulder.\n“Mistress Vin,” he said disapprovingly, “if Master Kelsier wanted us to\nhear what he was saying, would he not speak in a louder voice?”\nVin shot the Terrisman an angry glance. Then she reached inside and\nburned tin.\nThe sudden stench of blood almost staggered her. She could hear Sazed’s\nbreathing. The room was no longer dark—in fact, the brilliant light of two\nlanterns made her eyes water. She became aware of the stuffy, unventilated\nair.\nAnd she could hear, quite distinctly, Dockson’s voice.\n“ . . . went to check on him a couple times, like you asked. You’ll find\nhim three streets west of the Fourwell Crossroads.”\nKelsier nodded. “Ham,” he said in a loud voice, causing Vin to jump.\nSazed looked down at her with disapproving eyes."

He guessed what I was doing.\n“Yes, Kell?” Ham said, peeking out of the back room.\n“Take the others back to the shop,” Kelsier said. “And be careful.”\n“Of course,” Ham promised.\nVin eyed Kelsier, then resentfully allowed herself to be ushered from the\nlair with Sazed and Dockson.\nI should have taken the carriage, Kelsier thought, frustrated by his slow\npace. The others could have walked back from Camon’s lair.\nHe itched to burn steel and begin jumping toward his destination.\nUnfortunately, it was very difficult to remain inconspicuous when flying\nthrough the city during the full light of day.\nKelsier adjusted his hat and continued walking. A nobleman pedestrian\nwas not an irregular sight, especially in the commercial district, where more\nfortunate skaa and less fortunate noblemen mixed on the streets—though\neach group did its best to ignore the other.\nPatience. Speed doesn’t matter. If they know about him, he’s already\ndead.\nKelsier entered a large crossroad square. Four wells sat in its corners, and\na massive copper fountain—its green skin caked and blackened by soot—\ndominated the square’s center. The statue depicted the Lord Ruler, standing\ndramatically in cloak and armor, a formless representation of the Deepness\ndead in the water at his feet.\nKelsier passed the fountain, its waters flaked from a recent ashfall. Skaa\nbeggars called out from the streetsides, their pitiful voices walking a fine\nline between audibility and annoyance. The Lord Ruler barely suffered\nthem; only skaa with severe disfigurements were allowed to beg. Their\npitiful life, however, was not something even plantation skaa would envy.\nKelsier tossed them a few clips, not caring that doing so made him stand\nout, and continued to walk. Three streets over, he found a much smaller\ncrossroads. It was also rimmed by beggars, but no fine fountain splashed the\ncenter of this intersection, nor did the corners contain wells to draw traffic.\nThe beggars here were even more pathetic—these were the sorry\nindividuals who were too wretched to fight themselves a spot in a major\nsquare. Malnourished children and age-withered adults called out with\napprehensive voices; men missing two or more limbs huddled in corners,\ntheir soot-stained forms almost invisible in the shadows.\nKelsier reached reflexively for his coin purse. Stay on track, he told\nhimself. You can’t save them all, not with coins. There will be time for these\nonce the Final Empire is gone.\nIgnoring the piteous cries—which became louder once the beggars\nrealized he was watching them—Kelsier studied each face in turn. He had\nonly seen Camon briefly, but he thought that he’d recognize the man.\nHowever, none of the faces looked right, and none of the beggars had\nCamon’s girth, which should have still been noticeable despite weeks of\nstarvation."

Kelsier’s order—\ngiven to Milev, the new crewleader—that Camon be made a beggar had\nbeen carried out. Dockson had checked on Camon to make certain.\nCamon’s absence in the square could simply mean that he’d gained a\nbetter spot. It could also mean that the Ministry had found him. Kelsier\nstood quietly for a moment, listening to the beggars’ haunted moanings. A\nfew flakes of ash began to float down from the sky.\nSomething was wrong. There weren’t any beggars near the north corner\nof the intersection. Kelsier burned tin, and smelled blood on the air.\nHe kicked off his shoes, then pulled his belt free. His cloak clasp went\nnext, the fine garment dropping to the cobblestones. That done, the only\nmetal remaining on his body was in his coin pouch. He dumped a few coins\ninto his hand, then carefully made his way forward, leaving his discarded\ngarments for the beggars.\nThe smell of death grew stronger, but he didn’t hear anything except\nscrambling beggars behind him. He edged onto the northern street,\nimmediately noticing a thin alleyway to his left. Taking a breath, he flared\npewter and ducked inside.\nThe thin, dark alley was clogged with refuse and ash. No one waited for\nhim—at least, no one living.\nCamon, crewleader turned beggar, hung quietly from a rope tied far\nabove. His corpse spun leisurely in the breeze, ash falling lightly around it.\nHe hadn’t been hanged in the conventional fashion—the rope had been tied\nto a hook, then rammed down his throat. The bloodied end of the hook\njutted from his skin below the chin, and he swung with head tipped back,\nrope running out of his mouth. His hands were tied, his still plump body\nshowing signs of torture.\nThis isn’t good.\nA foot scraped the cobblestones behind, and Kelsier spun, flaring steel\nand spraying forth a handful of coins.\nWith a girlish yelp, a small figure ducked to the ground, coins deflected\nas she burned steel.\n“Vin?” Kelsier said. He cursed, reaching out and yanking her into the\nalleyway. He glanced around the corner, watching the beggars perk up as\nthey heard coins hit the cobblestones.\n“What are you doing here?” he demanded, turning back. Vin wore the\nsame brown overalls and gray shirt she had before, though she at least had\nthe sense to wear a nondescript cloak with the hood up.\n“I wanted to see what you were doing,” she said, cringing slightly before\nhis anger.\n“This could have been dangerous!” Kelsier said. “What were you\nthinking?”\nVin cowered further.\nKelsier calmed himself. You can’t blame her for being curious, he\nthought as a few brave beggars scuttled in the street after the coins. She’s\njust—\nKelsier froze. It was so subtle he almost missed it.

This child had made an art of making\nherself seem harmless.\nSo subtle! Kelsier thought. How did she get so good so quickly?\n“You don’t have to use Allomancy, Vin,” Kelsier said softly. “I’m not\ngoing to hurt you. You know that.”\nShe flushed. “I didn’t mean it . . . it’s just habit. Even still.”\n“It’s all right,” Kelsier said, laying a hand on her shoulder. “Just\nremember—no matter what Breeze says, it’s bad manners to touch the\nemotions of your friends. Plus, the noblemen consider it an insult to use\nAllomancy in formal settings. Those reflexes will get you into trouble if you\ndon’t learn to control them.”\nShe nodded, rising to study Camon. Kelsier expected her to turn away in\ndisgust, but she just stood quietly, a look of grim satisfaction on her face.\nNo, this one isn’t weak, Kelsier thought. No matter what she’d have you\nbelieve.\n“They tortured him here?” she asked. “Out in the open?”\nKelsier nodded, imagining the screams reverberating out to the\nuncomfortable beggars. The Ministry liked to be very visible with its\npunishments.\n“Why the hook?” Vin asked.\n“It’s a ritual killing reserved for the most reprehensible of sinners: people\nwho misuse Allomancy.”\nVin frowned. “Camon was an Allomancer?”\nKelsier shook his head. “He must have admitted to something heinous\nduring his torture.” Kelsier glanced at Vin. “He must have known what you\nwere, Vin. He used you intentionally.”\nShe paled slightly. “Then . . . the Ministry knows that I’m a Mistborn?”\n“Perhaps. It depends on whether Camon knew or not. He could have\nassumed you were just a Misting.”\nShe stood quietly for a moment. “What does this mean for my part in the\njob, then?”\n“We’ll continue as planned,” Kelsier said. “Only a couple of obligators\nsaw you at the Canton building, and it takes a very rare man to connect the\nskaa servant and the well-dressed noblewoman as the same person.”\n“And the Inquisitor?” Vin asked softly.\nKelsier didn’t have an answer to that one. “Come on,” he finally said.\n“We’ve already attracted too much attention.”\nWhat would it be like if every nation—from the isles in the South to the Terris hills in the North—were united under a single government? What wonders could be\nachieved, what progress could be made, if mankind were to permanently set aside its squabblings and join together?\nIt is too much, I suppose, to even hope for.

It pulled tightly at her waist and chest, then fell to\nthe floor with several layers of ruffled fabric, making it difficult to walk.\nShe kept feeling as if she were going to trip—and, despite the gown’s bulk,\nshe felt as if she were somehow exposed by how tight it was through the\nchest, not to mention the neckline’s low curve. Though she had exposed\nnearly as much skin when wearing normal, buttoning shirts, this seemed\ndifferent somehow.\nStill, she had to admit that the gown made quite a difference. The girl\nwho stood in the mirror before her was a strange, foreign creature. The light\nblue dress, with its white ruffles and lace, matched the sapphire barrettes in\nher hair. Sazed claimed he wouldn’t be happy until her hair was at least\nshoulder-length, but he had still suggested that she purchase the broochlike\nbarrettes and put them just above each ear.\n“Often, aristocrats don’t hide their deficiencies,” he had explained.\n“Instead, they highlight them. Draw attention to your short hair, and instead\nof thinking you’re unfashionable, they might be impressed by the statement\nyou are making.”\nShe also wore a sapphire necklace—modest by noble standards, but still\nworth more than two hundred boxings. It was complemented by a single\nruby bracelet for accentuation. Apparently, the current fashion dictated a\nsingle splash of a different color to provide contrast.\nAnd it was all hers, paid for by crew funds. If she ran, taking the jewelry\nand her three thousand boxings, she could live for decades. It was more\ntempting than she wanted to admit. Images of Camon’s men, their corpses\ntwisted and dead in the quiet lair, kept returning to her. That was probably\nwhat waited for her if she remained.\nWhy, then, didn’t she go?\nShe turned from the mirror, putting on a light blue silken shawl, the\nfemale aristocrat’s version of a cloak. Why didn’t she leave? Perhaps it was\nher promise to Kelsier. He had given her the gift of Allomancy, and he\ndepended on her. Perhaps it was her duty to the others. In order to survive,\ncrews needed each person to do their separate job.\nReen’s training told her that these men were fools, but she was tempted,\nenticed, by the possibility that Kelsier and the others offered. In the end, it\nwasn’t the wealth or the job’s thrill that made her stay. It was the shadowed\nprospect—unlikely and unreasonable, but still seductive—of a group whose\nmembers actually trusted one another. She had to stay. She had to know if it\nlasted, or if it was—as Reen’s growing whispers promised—all a lie.\nShe turned and left her room, walking toward the front of Mansion\nRenoux, where Sazed waited with a carriage.

The vehicle\ncontinued normally, however, and Sazed didn’t move from his place in the\ndriver’s seat.\nA sound came from above. Vin flared her metals, tensing, as a figure\ndropped down off the top of the carriage and landed on the footman’s rest\njust outside her door. Kelsier smiled as he peeked his head in the window.\nVin let out a relieved breath, settling back into her seat. “You could have\njust asked us to pick you up.”\n“No need,” Kelsier said, pulling open the carriage door and swinging\ninside. It was already dark outside, and he wore his mistcloak. “I warned\nSazed I’d be dropping by sometime during the trip.”\n“And you didn’t tell me?”\nKelsier winked, pulling the door shut. “I figured I still owed you for\nsurprising me in that alleyway last week.”\n“How very adult of you,” Vin said flatly.\n“I’ve always been very confident in my immaturity. So, are you ready for\nthis evening?”\nVin shrugged, trying to hide her nervousness. She glanced down. “How .\n. . uh, do I look?”\n“Splendid,” Kelsier said. “Just like a noble young lady. Don’t be nervous,\nVin—the disguise is perfect.”\nFor some reason, that didn’t feel like the answer she’d wanted to hear.\n“Kelsier?”\n“Yes?”\n“I’ve been meaning to ask this for a while,” she said, glancing out the\nwindow, though all she could see is mist. “I understand that you think this is\nimportant—having a spy among the nobility. But . . . well, do we really\nhave to do it this way? Couldn’t we get street informants to tell us what we\nneed to know about house politics?”\n“Perhaps,” Kelsier said. “But those men are called ‘informants’ for a\nreason, Vin. Every question you ask them gives a clue about your true\nmotives—even meeting with them reveals a bit of information that they\ncould sell to someone else. It’s better to rely on them as little as possible.”\nVin sighed.\n“I don’t send you into danger heedlessly, Vin,” Kelsier said, leaning\nforward. “We do need a spy among the nobility. Informants generally get\ntheir information from servants, but most aristocrats are not fools.\nImportant meetings go on where no servant can overhear them.”\n“And you expect me to be able to get into such meetings?”\n“Perhaps,” Kelsier said. “Perhaps not. Either way, I’ve learned that it’s\nalways useful to have someone infiltrate the nobility. You and Sazed will\noverhear vital items that street informants wouldn’t think important. In fact,\njust by being at these parties—even if you don’t overhear anything—you\nwill get us information.”\n“How so?” Vin asked, frowning.\n“Make note of the people who seem interested in you,” Kelsier said.\n“Those will be of the houses we want to watch. If they pay attention to you,\nthey’re probably paying attention to Lord Renoux—and there’s one good\nreason why they would be doing that.”\n“Weapons,” Vin said."

        "text": "they’re probably paying attention to Lord Renoux—and there’s one good\nreason why they would be doing that.”\n“Weapons,” Vin said.\nKelsier nodded. “Renoux’s position as a weapons merchant will make\nhim valuable to those who are planning military action. These are the\nhouses on which I’ll need to focus my attention. There should already be a\nsense of tension among the nobility—hopefully, they’re starting to wonder\nwhich houses are turning against the others. There hasn’t been an all-out\nwar among the Great Houses for over a century, but the last one was\ndevastating. We need to replicate it.”\n“That could mean the deaths of a lot of noblemen,” Vin said.\nKelsier smiled. “I can live with that. How about you?”\nVin smiled despite her tension.\n“There’s another reason for you to do this,” Kelsier said. “Sometime\nduring this fiasco of a plan of mine, we might need to face the Lord Ruler. I\nhave a feeling that the fewer people we need to sneak into his presence, the\nbetter. Having a skaa Mistborn hiding among the nobility . . . well, it could\nbe a powerful advantage.”\nVin felt a slight chill. “The Lord Ruler . . . will he be there tonight?”\n“No. There will be obligators in attendance, but probably no Inquisitors\n—and certainly not the Lord Ruler himself. A party like this is far beneath\nhis attention.”\nVin nodded. She’d never seen the Lord Ruler before—she’d never\nwanted to.\n“Don’t worry so much,” Kelsier said. “Even if you were to meet him,\nyou’d be safe. He can’t read minds.”\n“Are you sure?”\nKelsier paused. “Well, no. But, if he can read minds, he doesn’t do it to\neveryone he meets. I’ve known several skaa who pretended to be noblemen\nin his presence—I did it several times myself, before . . .” He trailed off,\nglancing down toward his scar-covered hands.\n“He caught you eventually,” Vin said quietly.\n“And he’ll probably do so again,” Kelsier said with a wink. “But, don’t\nworry about him for now—our goal this evening is to establish Lady Valette\nRenoux. You won’t need to do anything dangerous or unusual. Just make an\nappearance, then leave when Sazed tells you. We’ll worry about building\nconfidences later.”\nVin nodded.\n“Good girl,” Kelsier said, reaching out and pushing open the door. “I’ll\nbe hiding near the keep, watching and listening.”\nVin nodded gratefully, and Kelsier jumped out of the carriage door,\ndisappearing into the dark mists.\nVin was unprepared for how bright Keep Venture would be in the darkness.\nThe massive building was enveloped in an aura of misty light. As the\ncarriage approached, Vin could see that eight enormous lights blazed along\nthe outside of the rectangular building. They were as bright as bonfires, yet\nfar more steady, and they had mirrors arranged behind them to make them\nshine directly on the keep. Vin had trouble determining their purpose. The\nball would happen indoors—why light the outside of the building?\n“Head inside, please, Mistress Vin,” Sazed said from his position above.\n“Proper young ladies do not gawk.”"

It eventually rolled to a stop, and a Venture footman immediately\nopened her door. A second footman approached and held out a hand to help\nher down.\nVin accepted his hand, trying with as much grace as possible to pull the\nfrilled, bulky bottom of her dress out of the carriage. As she carefully\ndescended—trying not to trip—she was grateful for the footman’s steadying\nhand, and she finally realized why men were expected to help a lady out of\nher carriage. It wasn’t a silly custom after all—the clothing was the silly\npart.\nSazed surrendered the carriage and took his place a few steps behind her.\nHe wore robes even more fine than his standard fare; though they still\nmaintained the same V-like pattern, they had a belted waist and wide,\nenveloping sleeves.\n“Forward, Mistress,” Sazed coached quietly from behind. “Up the carpet,\nso that your dress doesn’t rub on the cobbles, and in through the main\ndoors.”\nVin nodded, trying to swallow her discomfort. She walked forward,\npassing noblemen and ladies in various suits and gowns. Though they\nweren’t looking at her, she felt exposed. Her steps were nowhere near as\ngraceful as those of the other ladies, who looked beautiful and comfortable\nin their gowns. Her hands began to sweat inside her silky, blue-white\ngloves.\nShe forced herself to continue. Sazed introduced her at the door,\npresenting her invitation to the attendants. The two men, dressed in black\nand red servant’s suits, bowed and waved her in. A crowd of aristocrats was\npooling slightly in the foyer, waiting to enter the main hall.\nWhat am I doing? she thought frantically. She could challenge mist and\nAllomancy, thieves and burglaries, mist-wraiths and beatings. Yet, facing\nthese noblemen and their ladies . . . going amongst them in the light, visible,\nunable to hide . . . this terrified her.\n“Forward, Mistress,” Sazed said in a soothing voice. “Remember your\nlessons.”\nHide! Find a corner! Shadows, mists, anything!\nVin kept her hands clasped rigidly before her, walking forward. Sazed\nwalked beside her. Out of the corner of her eyes, she could see concern on\nhis normally calm face.\nAnd well he should worry! Everything he had taught her seemed fleeting\n—vaporous, like the mists themselves. She couldn’t remember names,\ncustoms, anything.\nShe stopped just inside the foyer, and an imperious-looking nobleman in\na black suit turned to regard her. Vin froze.\nThe man looked her over with a dismissive glance, then turned away. She\ndistinctly heard the word “Renoux” whispered, and she glanced\napprehensively to the side. Several women were looking at her.\nAnd yet, it didn’t feel like they were seeing her at all. They were studying\nthe gown, the hair, and the jewelry. Vin glanced to the other side, where a"

Vin glanced to the other side, where a\ngroup of younger men were watching her. They saw the neckline, the pretty\ndress and the makeup, but they didn’t see her.\nNone of them could see Vin, they could only see the face she had put on\n—the face she wanted them to see. They saw Lady Valette. It was as if Vin\nweren’t there.\nAs if . . . she were hiding, hiding right in front of their eyes.\nAnd suddenly, her tension began to retreat. She let out a long, calming\nbreath, anxiety flowing away. Sazed’s training returned, and she adopted the\nlook of a girl amazed by her first formal ball. She stepped to the side,\nhanding her shawl to an attendant, and Sazed relaxed beside her. Vin shot\nhim a smile, then swept forward into the main hall.\nShe could do this. She was still nervous, but the moment of panic was\nover. She didn’t need shadows or corners—she just needed a mask of\nsapphires, makeup, and blue fabric.\nThe Venture main hall was a grand and imposing sight. Four or five\ndaunting stories high, the hall was several times as long as it was wide.\nEnormous, rectangular stained-glass windows ran in rows along the hall,\nand the strange, powerful lights outside shone on them directly, throwing a\ncascade of colors across the room. Massive, ornate stone pillars were set\ninto the walls, running between the windows. Just before the pillars met the\nfloor, the wall fell away, indenting and creating a single-story gallery\nbeneath the windows themselves. Dozens of white-clothed tables sat in this\narea, shadowed behind the pillars and beneath the overhang. In the distance,\nat the far end of the hallway, Vin could make out a low balcony set into the\nwall, and this held a smaller group of tables.\n“The dining table of Lord Straff Venture,” Sazed whispered, gesturing\ntoward the far balcony.\nVin nodded. “And those lights outside?”\n“Limelights, Mistress,” Sazed explained. “I’m not certain the process\nused—somehow, the quicklime stones can be heated to brilliance without\nmelting them.”\nA string orchestra played on a platform to her left, providing music for\nthe couples who danced in the very center of the hall. To her right, serving\ntables held platter upon platter of foods being attended by scurrying serving\nmen in white.\nSazed approached an attendant and presented Vin’s invitation. The man\nnodded, then whispered something in a younger servant’s ear. The young\nman bowed to Vin, then led the way into the room.\n“I asked for a small, solitary table,” Sazed said. “You won’t need to\nmingle during this visit, I think. Just be seen.”\nVin nodded gratefully.\n“The solitary table will mark you as single,” Sazed warned. “Eat slowly\n—once your meal is through, men will come to ask you to dance.”\n“You didn’t teach me to dance!” Vin said in an urgent whisper.\n“There wasn’t time, Mistress,” Sazed said. “Worry not—respectfully and\nrightly, you can refuse these men. They will assume that you are simply"

They will assume that you are simply\nflustered by your first ball, and no harm will be done.”\nVin nodded, and the serving man led them to a small table near the center\nof the hallway. Vin seated herself in the only chair while Sazed ordered her\nmeal. He then stepped up to stand behind her chair.\nVin sat primly, waiting. Most of the tables lay just beneath the overhang\nof the gallery—up close to the dancing—and that left a corridorlike\nwalkway behind them, near the wall. Couples and groups passed along this,\nspeaking quietly. Occasionally someone gestured or nodded toward Vin.\nWell, that part of Kelsier’s plan is working. She was getting noticed. She\nhad to force herself not to cringe or sink down in her chair, however, as a\nhigh prelan strolled along the pathway behind her. He wasn’t the one she\nhad met, fortunately, though he had the same gray robes and dark tattoos\naround his eyes.\nActually, there were a fair number of obligators at the party. They strolled\nabout, mingling with the partygoers. And yet, there was an . . . aloofness to\nthem. A division. They hovered about, almost like chaperones.\nThe Garrison watches the skaa, Vin thought. Apparently, the obligators\nperform a similar function for the nobility. It was an odd sight—she’d\nalways thought of the noblemen as being free. And, truthfully, they were far\nmore confident than the skaa. Many seemed to be enjoying themselves, and\nthe obligators didn’t seem to be acting really as police, or even specifically\nas spies. And yet, they were there. Hovering about, joining in conversations.\nA constant reminder of the Lord Ruler and his empire.\nVin turned her attention away from the obligators—their presence still\nmade her a bit uncomfortable—and instead focused on something else: the\nbeautiful windows. Sitting where she was, she could see some of the ones\ndirectly across and up from where she sat.\nThey were religious, like many scenes preferred by the aristocracy.\nPerhaps it was to show devotion, or perhaps it was required. Vin didn’t\nknow enough—but, likely, that was something Valette wouldn’t know\neither, so it was all right.\nShe did, fortunately, recognize some of the scenes—mostly because of\nSazed’s teachings. He seemed to know as much about the Lord Ruler’s\nmythology as he did about other religions, though it seemed odd to her that\nhe would study the very religion he found so oppressive.\nCentral to many of the windows was the Deepness. Dark black—or, in\nwindow terms, violet—it was formless, with vengeful, tentaclelike masses\ncreeping across several windows. Vin looked up at it, along with the\nbrilliantly colored depictions of the Lord Ruler, and found herself a little bit\ntransfixed by the backlit scenes.\nWhat was it? she wondered. The Deepness? Why depict it so formlessly—\nwhy not show what it really was?\nShe’d never really wondered about the Deepness before, but Sazed’s\nlessons left her wondering. Her instincts whispered scam.

The Lord Ruler\nhad invented some terrible menace that he’d been able to destroy in the\npast, therefore “earning” his place as emperor. And yet, staring up at the\nhorrible, twisting thing, Vin could almost believe.\nWhat if something like that had existed? And, if it had, how had the Lord\nRuler managed to defeat it?\nShe sighed, shaking her head at the thoughts. Already, she was beginning\nto think too much like a noblewoman. She was admiring the beauty of the\ndecorations—thinking about what they meant—without giving more than a\npassing thought to the wealth that had created them. It was just that\neverything here was so wondrous and ornate.\nThe pillars in the hall weren’t just normal columns, they were carved\nmasterpieces. Wide banners hung from the ceiling just above the windows,\nand the arching, lofty ceiling was crisscrossed by structural buttressings and\ndotted with capstones. Somehow she knew each of those capstones was\nintricately carved, despite the fact that they were too far away to be seen\nfrom below.\nAnd the dancers matched, perhaps even outshone, the exquisite setting.\nCouples moved gracefully, stepping to the soft music with seemingly\neffortless motions. Many were even chatting with one another while they\ndanced. The ladies moved freely in their dresses—many of which, Vin\nnoticed, made her own frilly garment look plain by comparison. Sazed was\nright: Long hair was certainly the fashion, though an equal number kept\ntheir hair up as left it down.\nSurrounded by the majestic hall, the sharp-suited noblemen looked\ndifferent, somehow. Distinguished. Were these the same creatures that beat\nher friends and enslaved the skaa? They seemed too . . . perfect, too well-\nmannered, for such horrible acts.\nI wonder if they even notice the outside world, she thought, crossing her\narms on the table as she watched the dancing. Perhaps they can’t see\nbeyond their keeps and their balls—just like they can’t see past my dress\nand makeup.\nSazed tapped her shoulder, and Vin sighed, adopting a more ladylike\nposture. The meal arrived a few moments later—a feast of such strange\nflavors that she would have been daunted, had she not eaten similar fare\noften during the last few months. Sazed’s lessons might have omitted\ndancing, but they had been quite extensive regarding dining etiquette, for\nwhich Vin was grateful. As Kelsier had said, her main purpose of the\nevening was to make an appearance—and so it was important that she make\na proper one.\nShe ate delicately, as instructed, and that allowed her to be slow and\nmeticulous. She didn’t relish the idea of being asked to dance; she was half\nafraid she’d panic again if anyone actually spoke to her. However, a meal\ncould only be extended so long—especially one with a lady’s small\nportions. She soon finished, and set her fork across the plate, indicating that\nshe was done.\nThe first suitor approached not two minutes later. “Lady Valette\nRenoux?” the young man asked, bowing just slightly.

He wore a green vest\nbeneath his long, dark suit coat. “I am Lord Rian Strobe. Would you care to\ndance?”\n“My lord,” Vin said, glancing down demurely. “You are kind, but this is\nmy first ball, and everything here is so grand! I fear that I’ll stumble from\nnervousness on the dance floor. Perhaps, next time . . .?”\n“Of course, my lady,” he said with a courteous nod, then withdrew.\n“Very well done, Mistress,” Sazed said quietly. “Your accent was\nmasterful. You will, of course, have to dance with him at the next ball. We\nshall surely have you trained by then, I think.”\nVin flushed slightly. “Maybe he won’t attend.”\n“Perhaps,” Sazed said. “But not likely. The young nobility are quite fond\nof their nightly diversions.”\n“They do this every night?”\n“Nearly,” Sazed said. “The balls are, after all, a prime reason people\ncome to Luthadel. If one is in town and there is a ball—and there almost\nalways is—one generally attends, especially if one is young and unmarried.\nYou won’t be expected to attend quite so frequently, but we should probably\nget you up to attending two or three a week.”\n“Two or three . . .” Vin said. “I’m going to need more gowns!”\nSazed smiled. “Ah, thinking like a noblewoman already. Now, Mistress,\nif you will excuse me . . .”\n“Excuse you?” Vin asked, turning.\n“To the steward’s dinner,” Sazed said. “A servant of my rank is generally\ndismissed once my master’s meal is finished. I hesitate to go and leave you,\nbut that room will be filled with the self-important servants of the high\nnobility. There will be conversations there that Master Kelsier wishes me to\noverhear.”\n“You’re leaving me by myself?”\n“You’ve done well so far, Mistress,” Sazed said. “No major mistakes—\nor, at least, none that wouldn’t be expected of a lady new to court.”\n“Like what?” Vin asked apprehensively.\n“We shall discuss them later. Just remain at your table, sipping your wine\n—try not to get it refilled too often—and wait for my return. If other young\nmen approach, turn them away as delicately as you did the first.”\nVin nodded hesitantly.\n“I shall return in about an hour,” Sazed promised. He remained, however,\nas if waiting for something.\n“Um, you are dismissed,” Vin said.\n“Thank you, Mistress,” he said, bowing and withdrawing. Leaving her\nalone.\nNot alone, she thought. Kelsier’s out there somewhere, watching in the\nnight. The thought comforted her, though she wished she didn’t feel the\nempty space beside her chair quite so keenly.\nThree more young men approached her for dances, but each one accepted\nher polite rejection. No others came after them; word had probably gotten\naround that she wasn’t interested in dancing. She memorized the names of\nthe four men who had approached her—Kelsier would want to know them\n—and began to wait."

She memorized the names of\nthe four men who had approached her—Kelsier would want to know them\n—and began to wait.\nOddly, she soon found herself growing bored. The room was well\nventilated, but she still felt hot beneath the layers of fabric. Her legs were\nespecially bad, since they had to deal with her ankle-long undergarments.\nThe long sleeves didn’t help either, though the silky material was soft\nagainst her skin. The dancing continued, and she watched with interest for a\ntime. However, her attention soon turned to the obligators.\nInterestingly, they did seem to serve some sort of function at the party.\nThough they often stood apart from the groups of chatting nobility,\noccasionally they would join in. And, every so often, a group would pause\nand seek out an obligator, waving one over with a respectful gesture.\nVin frowned, trying to decide what she was missing. Eventually, a group\nat a nearby table waved to a passing obligator. The table was too far away to\nhear unaided, but with tin . . .\nShe reached inside to burn the metal, but then paused. Copper first, she\nthought, turning the metal on. She would have to grow accustomed to\nleaving it on almost all the time, so that she wouldn’t expose herself.\nHer Allomancy hidden, she burned tin. Immediately, the light in the room\nbecame blinding, and she had to close her eyes. The band’s music became\nlouder, and a dozen conversations around her turned from buzzes to audible\nvoices. She had to try hard to focus on the one she was interested in, but the\ntable was the one closest to her, so she eventually singled out the\nappropriate voices.\n“ . . . swear that I’ll share news of my engagement with him before\nanyone else,” one of the people said. Vin opened her eyes a slit—it was one\nof the noblemen at the table.\n“Very well,” said the obligator. “I witness and record this.”\nThe nobleman reached out a hand, and coins clinked. Vin extinguished\nher tin, opening her eyes all the way in time to see the obligator wandering\naway from the table, slipping something—likely the coins—into a pocket of\nhis robes.\nInteresting, Vin thought.\nUnfortunately, the people at that table soon rose and went their separate\nways, leaving Vin without anyone close enough to eavesdrop upon. Her\nboredom returned as she watched the obligator stroll across the room\ntoward one of his companions. She began to tap on the table, idly watching\nthe two obligators until she realized something.\nShe recognized one of them. Not the one who had taken the money\nearlier, but his companion, an older man. Short and firm-featured, he stood\nwith an imperious air. Even the other obligator seemed deferential to him.\nAt first, Vin thought her familiarity came from her visit to the Canton of\nFinance with Camon, and she felt a stab of panic. Then, however, she\nrealized that this wasn’t the same man. She’d seen him before, but not there.\nHe was . . .\nMy father, she realized with stupefaction.\nReen had pointed him out once, when they had first come to Luthadel, a"

Reen had\ntaken Vin, sneaking her in, insisting that she at least see her father once—\nthough she still didn’t understand why. She had memorized the face\nanyway.\nShe resisted the urge to shrink down in her chair. There was no way the\nman would be able to recognize her—he didn’t even know she existed. She\nforcibly turned her attention away from him, looking up at the windows\ninstead. She couldn’t get that good a look at them, however, because the\npillars and overhang restricted her view.\nAs she sat, she noticed something she hadn’t seen before—a lofty, inset\nbalcony that ran just above the entire far wall. It was like a counterpart to\nthe alcove beneath the windows, except it ran at the top of the wall,\nbetween the stained-glass windows and the ceiling. She could see\nmovement upon it, couples and singles strolling along, looking down upon\nthe party below.\nHer instincts drew her toward the balcony, from where she could watch\nthe party without being seen herself. It would also give her a wonderful\nview of the banners and the windows directly above her table, not to\nmention let her study the stonework without seeming to gawk.\nSazed had told her to stay, but the more she sat, the more she found her\neyes drawn toward the hidden balcony. She itched to stand up and move, to\nstretch her legs and perhaps air them out a bit. The presence of her father—\noblivious of her or not—served only as another motivation for her to leave\nthe main floor.\nIt isn’t like anyone else is asking me to dance, she thought. And I’ve done\nwhat Kelsier wanted, I’ve been seen by the nobility.\nShe paused, then waved for a serving boy.\nHe approached with alacrity. “Yes, Lady Renoux?”\n“How do I get up there?” Vin asked, pointing toward the balcony.\n“There are stairs just to the side of the orchestra, my lady,” the boy said.\n“Climb them to the top landing.”\nVin nodded her thanks. Then, determined, she stood and made her way to\nthe front of the room. No one gave her passing more than a glance, and she\nwalked with more confidence as she crossed the hallway to the stairwell.\nThe stone corridor twisted upward, curling upon itself, its steps short but\nsteep. Little stained glass windows, no wider than her hand, ran up the\noutside wall—though they were dark in color, lacking backlight. Vin\nclimbed eagerly, working away her restless energy, but she soon began to\npuff from the weight of the dress and the difficulty of holding it up so that\nshe didn’t trip. A spark of burned pewter, however, made the climb\neffortless enough that she didn’t sweat and ruin her makeup.\nThe climb proved to be worth the effort. The upper balcony was dark—lit\nonly by several small blue-glassed lanterns on the walls—and it gave an\namazing view of the stained-glass windows.

It, like the lantern\nbracket behind her, was intricate and detailed—both had been wrought in\nthe form of thick, curving vines. To her sides, the tops of the pillars were\ncarved into stone animals that appeared frozen in the motion of jumping off\nof the balcony.\n“Now, see, here’s the problem with going to refill your cup of wine.”\nThe sudden voice made Vin jump, and she spun. A young man stood\nbehind her. His suit wasn’t the finest she had seen, nor was his vest as bright\nas most. Both coat and shirt seemed to fit too loosely, and his hair was just a\nbit disheveled. He carried a cup of wine, and the outer pocket of his suit\ncoat bulged with the shape of a book that was just a bit too big for its\nconfines.\n“The problem is,” the young man said, “you return to find that your\nfavorite spot has been stolen by a pretty girl. Now, a gentleman would move\non to another place, leaving the lady to her contemplations. However, this is\nthe best spot on the balcony—it’s the only place close enough to a lantern to\nhave good reading light.”\nVin flushed. “I’m sorry, my lord.”\n“Ah, see, now I feel guilty. All for a cup of wine. Look, there’s plenty of\nroom for two people here—just scoot over a bit.”\nVin paused. Could she politely refuse? He obviously wanted her to stay\nnear him—did he know who she was? Should she try to find out his name,\nso she could tell Kelsier?\nShe stepped a bit to the side, and the man took a place next to her. He\nleaned back against the side pillar, and, surprisingly, took out his book and\nbegan to read. He was right: The lantern shined directly on the pages. Vin\nstood for a moment, watching him, but he seemed completely absorbed. He\ndidn’t even pause to look up at her.\nIsn’t he going to pay me any attention at all? Vin thought, puzzled at her\nown annoyance. Maybe I should have worn a fancier dress.\nThe man sipped at his wine, focused on the book.\n“Do you always read at balls?” she asked.\nThe young man looked up. “Whenever I can get away with it.”\n“Doesn’t that kind of defeat the purpose of coming?” Vin asked. “Why\nattend if you’re just going to avoid socializing?”\n“You’re up here too,” he pointed out.\nVin flushed. “I just wanted to get a brief view of the hall.”\n“Oh? And why did you refuse all three men who asked you to dance?”\nVin paused. The man smiled, then turned back to his book.\n“There were four,” Vin said with a huff. “And I refused them because I\ndon’t know how to dance very well.”\nThe man lowered his book slightly, eyeing her. “You know, you’re a lot"

Far better looking, but just as grumpy.”\nVin glared at him. Finally, he rolled his eyes. “Very well, let me be a\ngentleman, then.” He bowed to her with a refined, formal step. “I am Lord\nElend. Lady Valette Renoux, might I have the pleasure of sharing this\nbalcony with you whilst I read?”\nVin folded her arms. Elend? Family name or given name? Should I even\ncare? He just wanted his spot back. But . . . how did he know that I’d\nrefused dancing partners? Somehow, she had a suspicion that Kelsier\nwould want to hear about this particular conversation.\nOddly, she didn’t feel a desire to shrug this man away as she had the\nothers. Instead, she felt another stab of annoyance as he again raised his\nbook.\n“You still haven’t told me why you would rather read than participate,”\nshe said.\nThe man sighed, lowering the book again. “Well, see, I’m not exactly the\nbest dancer either.”\n“Ah,” Vin said.\n“But,” he said, raising a finger, “that’s only part of it. You may not realize\nthis yet, but it’s not that hard to get overpartied. Once you attend five or six\nhundred of these balls, they start to feel a bit repetitive.”\nVin shrugged. “You’d probably learn to dance better if you practiced.”\nElend raised an eyebrow. “You’re not going to let me get back to my\nbook, are you?”\n“I wasn’t intending to.”\nHe sighed, tucking the book back into his jacket pocket—which was\nbeginning to show signs of book-shaped wear. “Well, then. Do you want to\ngo dance instead?”\nVin froze. Elend smiled nonchalantly.\nLord! He’s either incredibly smooth or socially incompetent. It was\ndisturbing that she couldn’t determine which.\n“That’s a no, I assume?” Elend said. “Good—I thought I should offer,\nsince we’ve established that I’m a gentleman. However, I doubt the couples\nbelow would appreciate us trampling their toes.”\n“Agreed. What were you reading?”\n“Dilisteni,” Elend said. “Trials of Monument. Heard of it?”\nVin shook her head.\n“Ah, well. Not many have.” He leaned over the railing, looking below.\n“So, what do you think of your first experience at court?”\n“It’s very . . . overwhelming.”\nElend chuckled. “Say what you will about House Venture—they know\nhow to throw a party.”\nVin nodded. “You don’t like House Venture, then?” she said. Perhaps this\nwas one of the rivalries Kelsier was watching for.\n“Not particularly, no,” Elend said. “They’re an ostentatious lot, even for"

Not words I’d expect to hear from a nobleman.\nElend paused, looking a little embarrassed. “But, well, never mind that. I\nthink your Terrisman is looking for you.”\nVin started, glancing over the side of the balcony. Sure enough, Sazed’s\ntall form stood by her now-empty table, speaking to a serving boy.\nVin yelped quietly. “I’ve got to go,” she said, turning toward the\nstairwell.\n“Ah, well then,” Elend said, “back to reading it is.” He gave her a half\nwave of farewell, but he had his book open before she passed the first step.\nVin reached the bottom out of breath. Sazed saw her immediately.\n“I’m sorry,” she said, chagrined as she approached.\n“Do not apologize to me, Mistress,” Sazed said quietly. “It is both\nunseemly and unnecessary. Moving about a bit was a good idea, I think. I\nwould have suggested it, had you not seemed so nervous.”\nVin nodded. “Is it time for us to go, then?”\n“It is a proper time to withdraw, if you wish,” he said, glancing up at the\nbalcony. “May I ask what you were doing up there, Mistress?”\n“I wanted to get a better look at the windows,” Vin said. “But I ended up\ntalking to someone. He seemed interested in me at first, but now I don’t\nthink he ever intended to pay me much attention. It doesn’t matter—he\ndidn’t seem important enough to bother Kelsier with his name.”\nSazed paused. “Who was it you were speaking to?”\n“The man in the corner there, on the balcony,” Vin said.\n“One of Lord Venture’s friends?”\nVin froze. “Is one of them named Elend?”\nSazed paled visibly. “You were chatting with Lord Elend Venture?”\n“Um . . . yes?”\n“Did he ask you to dance?”\nVin nodded. “But I don’t think he meant it.”\n“Oh, dear,” Sazed said. “So much for controlled anonymity.”\n“Venture?” Vin asked, frowning. “Like, Keep Venture?”\n“Heir to the house title,” Sazed said.\n“Hum,” Vin said, realizing that she should probably be a bit more\nintimidated than she felt. “He was a bit annoying—in a pleasant sort of\nway.”\n“We shouldn’t be discussing this here,” Sazed said. “You’re far, far below\nhis station. Come, let us retire. I shouldn’t have gone away to the dinner. . .\n.”\nHe trailed off, mumbling to himself as he led Vin to the entryway.

She smiled, and let Sazed usher her to\ntheir carriage.\nI know that I shouldn’t let a simple packman perturb me. However, he is from Terris, where the prophecies originated. If anyone could spot a fraud, would it not be he?\nNevertheless, I continue my trek, going where the scribbled auguries proclaim that I will meet my destiny—walking, feeling Rashek’s eyes on my back.

He stood\non the other side of the room, and Vin got the distinct impression that she\nwas in trouble. Sazed had questioned her in depth, seeking out every detail\nof her conversation with Lord Elend. Sazed’s inquiries had been respectful,\nof course, but they had also been forceful.\nThe Terrisman seemed, in Vin’s opinion, unduly worried about her\nexchange with the young nobleman. They hadn’t really talked about\nanything important, and Elend himself was decidedly unspectacular for a\nGreat House lord.\nBut, there had been something odd about him—something Vin hadn’t\nadmitted to Sazed. She’d felt . . . comfortable with Elend. Looking back on\nthe experience, she realized that for those few moments, she hadn’t really\nbeen Lady Valette. Nor had she been Vin, for that part of her—the timid\ncrewmember—was almost as fake as Valette was.\nNo, she’d simply been . . . whoever she was. It was a strange experience.\nShe had occasionally felt the same way during her time with Kelsier and the\nothers, but in a more limited manner. How had Elend been able to evoke her\ntrue self so quickly and so thoroughly?\nMaybe he used Allomancy on me! she thought with a start. Elend was a\nhigh nobleman; perhaps he was a Soother. Maybe there was more to the\nconversation than she had thought.\nVin sat back in her chair, frowning to herself. She’d had copper on, and\nthat meant he couldn’t have used emotional Allomancy on her. Somehow,\nhe had simply gotten her to let her guard down. Vin thought back to the\nexperience, thinking about how oddly comfortable she’d felt. In retrospect,\nit was clear that she hadn’t been careful enough.\nI’ll be more cautious next time. She assumed that they would meet again.\nThey’d better.\nA servant entered and whispered quietly to Sazed. A quick burn of tin let\nVin hear the conversation—Kelsier had finally returned.\n“Please send word to Lord Renoux,” Sazed said. The white-clothed\nservant nodded, leaving the room with a quick step.\n“The rest of you may leave,” Sazed said calmly, and the room’s\nattendants scampered away.

Sazed’s quiet vigil had forced them to stand,\nwaiting in the tense room, not speaking or moving.\nKelsier and Lord Renoux arrived together, chatting quietly. As always,\nRenoux wore a rich suit cut in the unfamiliar Western style. The aging man\nkept his gray mustache trimmed thin and neat, and he walked with a\nconfident air. Even after spending an entire evening among the nobility, Vin\nwas again struck by his aristocratic bearing.\nKelsier still wore his mistcloak. “Saze?” he said as he entered. “You have\nnews?”\n“I am afraid so, Master Kelsier,” Sazed said. “It appears that Mistress Vin\ncaught the attention of Lord Elend Venture at the ball tonight.”\n“Elend?” Kelsier asked, folding his arms. “Isn’t he the heir?”\n“He is indeed,” Renoux said. “I met the lad perhaps four years ago, when\nhis father visited the West. He struck me as a bit undignified for one of his\nstation.”\nFour years? Vin thought. There’s no way he’s been imitating Lord\nRenoux for that long. Kelsier only escaped the Pits two years ago! She eyed\nthe impostor, but—as always—was unable to detect a flaw in his bearing.\n“How attentive was the boy?” Kelsier asked.\n“He asked her to dance,” Sazed said. “But Mistress Vin was wise enough\nto decline. Apparently, their meeting was a matter of idle happenstance—\nbut I fear she may have caught his eye.”\nKelsier chuckled. “You taught her too well, Saze. In the future, Vin,\nperhaps you should try to be a little less charming.”\n“Why?” Vin asked, trying to mask her annoyance. “I thought we wanted\nme to be well liked.”\n“Not by a man as important as Elend Venture, child,” Lord Renoux said.\n“We sent you to court so you could make alliances—not scandals.”\nKelsier nodded. “Venture is young, eligible, and heir to a powerful house.\nYour having a relationship with him could make serious problems for us.\nThe women of the court would be jealous of you, and the older men would\ndisapprove of the rank difference. You’d alienate yourself from large\nsections of the court. To get the information we need, we need the\naristocracy to see you as uncertain, unimportant, and—most importantly—\nunthreatening.”\n“Besides, child,” Lord Renoux said. “It is unlikely that Elend Venture has\nany real interest in you. He is known to be a court eccentric—he is probably\njust trying to heighten his reputation by doing the unexpected.”\nVin felt her face flush. He’s probably right, she told herself sternly. Still,\nshe couldn’t help feeling annoyed at the three of them—especially Kelsier,\nwith his flippant, unconcerned attitude.\n“Yes,” Kelsier said, “it’s probably best that you avoid Venture\ncompletely. Try to offend him or something. Give him a couple of those\nglares you do.”\nVin regarded Kelsier with a flat look.\n“That’s the one!” Kelsier said with a laugh.\nVin clinched her teeth, then forced herself to relax. “I saw my father at\nthe ball tonight,” she said, hoping to distract Kelsier and the others away"

Do you know what his\nname is?”\nVin shook her head.\n“Description?” Kelsier asked.\n“Uh . . . bald, eye tattoos . . .”\nKelsier chuckled. “Just point him out to me sometime, all right?”\nVin nodded, and Kelsier turned to Sazed. “Now, did you bring me the\nnames of which noblemen asked Vin to dance?”\nSazed nodded. “She gave me a list, Master Kelsier. I also have several\ninteresting tidbits to share from the stewards’ meal.”\n“Good,” Kelsier said, glancing at the grandfather clock in the corner.\n“You’ll have to save them for tomorrow morning, though. I’ve got to be\ngoing.”\n“Going?” Vin asked, perking up. “But you just got in!”\n“That’s the funny thing about arriving somewhere, Vin,” he said with a\nwink. “Once you’re there, the only thing you can really do is leave again.\nGet some sleep—you’re looking a bit ragged.”\nKelsier waved a farewell to the group, then ducked out of the room,\nwhistling amiably to himself.\nToo nonchalant, Vin thought. And too secretive. He usually tells us which\nfamilies he plans to hit.\n“I think I will retire,” Vin said, yawning.\nSazed eyed her suspiciously, but let her go as Renoux began speaking\nquietly to him. Vin scrambled up the stairs to her room, threw on her\nmistcloak, and pushed open her balcony doors.\nMist poured into the room. She flared iron, and was rewarded with the\nsight of a fading blue metal line, pointing into the distance.\nLet’s see where you’re going, Master Kelsier.\nVin burned steel, Pushing herself into the cold, humid autumn night. Tin\nenhanced her eyes, making the wet air tickle her throat as she breathed. She\nPushed hard behind her, then Pulled slightly on the gates below. The\nmaneuver swung her in a soaring arc over the steel gates, which she then\nPushed against to throw herself farther into the air.\nShe kept an eye on the trail of blue that pointed toward Kelsier, following\nhim at enough of a distance to remain unseen. She wasn’t carrying any\nmetal—not even coins—and she kept her copper burning to hide her use of\nAllomancy. Theoretically, only sound could alert Kelsier of her presence,\nand so she moved as quietly as possible.\nSurprisingly, Kelsier didn’t head into town. After passing the mansion’s\ngates, he turned north out of the city. Vin followed, landing and running\nquietly on the rough ground.\nWhere is he going? she thought with confusion. Is he circling Fellise?\nHeading for one of the peripheral mansions?"

The line faded at a rapid rate: Kelsier had suddenly sped up.\nShe cursed to herself, breaking into a dash.\nAhead, Kelsier’s line vanished into the night. Vin sighed, slowing. She\nflared her iron, but it was barely enough to catch a glimpse of him\ndisappearing again in the distance. She’d never keep up.\nHer flared iron, however, showed her something else. She frowned,\ncontinuing forward until she reached a stationary source of metal—two\nsmall bronze bars stuck into the ground a couple feet from each other. She\nflipped one up into her hand, then looked into the swirling mists to the\nnorth.\nHe’s jumping, she thought. But why? Jumping was faster than walking,\nbut there didn’t seem much point to it in the empty wilderness.\nUnless . . .\nShe walked forward, and she soon found two more bronze bars\nembedded in the earth. Vin glanced backward. It was hard to tell in the\nnight, but it seemed that the four bars made a line that pointed directly\ntoward Luthadel.\nSo that’s how he does it, she thought. Kelsier had an uncanny ability to\nmove between Luthadel and Fellise with remarkable speed. She’d assumed\nthat he was using horses, but it appeared that there was a better way. He—\nor perhaps someone before him—had laid down an Allomantic road\nbetween the two cities.\nShe gripped the first bar in her palm—she’d need it to soften her landing\nif she was wrong—then stepped up in front of the second pair of bars and\nlaunched herself into the air.\nShe Pushed hard, flaring her steel, throwing herself as far up into the sky\nas she could. As she flew, she flared her iron, searching for other sources of\nmetal. They soon appeared—two directly north, and two more in the\ndistance to either side of her.\nThe ones on the sides are for course corrections, she realized. She’d have\nto keep moving directly north if she wanted to stay on the bronze highway.\nShe nudged herself slightly to the left—moving so that she passed directly\nbetween the two adjacent bars of the main path—then hurled herself\nforward again in an arcing leap.\nShe got the hang of it quickly, hopping from point to point, never\ndropping even close to the ground. In just a few minutes, she had the\nrhythm down so well that she barely had to do any corrections from the\nsides.\nHer progress across the scraggly landscape was incredibly swift. The\nmists blew by, her mistcloak whipping and flapping behind her. Still, she\nforced herself to speed up. She’d spent too long studying the bronze bars.\nShe had to catch up to Kelsier; otherwise she’d arrive in Luthadel, but not\nknow where to go from there.\nShe began to throw herself from point to point at an almost reckless\nspeed, watching desperately for some sign of Allomantic motion. After\nabout ten minutes of leaping, a line of blue finally appeared ahead of her—"

She\nflared tin, and a massive shadow appeared in the night before her, its top\nsparkling with balls of light.\nThe city wall, she thought with amazement. So soon? I made the trip\ntwice as fast as a man on horseback!\nHowever, that meant she’d lost Kelsier. Frowning to herself, she used the\nbar she’d been carrying to throw herself up onto the battlements. Once she\nlanded on the damp stone, she reached behind and Pulled the bar up into her\nhand. Then she approached the other side of the wall, hopping up and\ncrouching on the stone railing as she scanned the city.\nWhat now? she thought with annoyance. Head back to Fellise? Stop by\nClubs’s shop and see if he went there?\nShe sat uncertainly for a moment, then threw herself off the wall and\nbegan making her way across the rooftops. She wandered randomly,\npushing off of window clasps and bits of metal, using the bronze bar—then\npulling it back into her hand—when long jumps were necessary. It wasn’t\nuntil she arrived that she realized she’d unconsciously gone to a specific\ndestination.\nKeep Venture rose before her in the night. The limelights had been\nextinguished, and only a few phantom torches burned near guard posts.\nVin crouched on the lip on a rooftop, trying to decide what had led her\nback to the massive keep. The cool wind ruffled her hair and cloak, and she\nthought she felt a few tiny raindrops on her cheek. She sat for a long\nmoment, her toes growing cold.\nThen she noticed motion to her right. She crouched immediately, flaring\nher tin.\nKelsier sat on a rooftop not three houses away, just barely lit by ambient\nlight. He didn’t seem to have noticed her. He was watching the keep, his\nface too distant for her to read his expression.\nVin watched him with suspicious eyes. He’d dismissed her meeting with\nElend, but perhaps it worried him more than he’d admitted. A sudden spike\nof fear made her tense.\nCould he be here to kill Elend? The assassination of a high noble heir\nwould certainly create tension amongst the nobility.\nVin waited apprehensively. Eventually, however, Kelsier stood and\nwalked away, Pushing himself off the rooftop and into the air.\nVin dropped her bronze bar—it would give her away—and dashed after\nhim. Her iron showed blue lines moving in the distance, and she hurriedly\njumped out over the street and Pushed herself off a sewer grate below,\ndetermined not to lose him again.\nHe moved toward the center of the city. Vin frowned, trying to guess his\ndestination. Keep Erikeller was in that direction, and it was a major supplier\nof armaments. Perhaps Kelsier planned to do something to interrupt its\nsupplies, making House Renoux more vital to the local nobility."

I’ve started being more careful since\nyou tailed me last week—at first, I assumed you were a Venture Mistborn.”\n“They have some?”\n“I’m sure they do,” Kelsier said. “Most of the Great Houses do—but\nyour friend Elend isn’t one of them. He’s not even a Misting.”\n“How do you know? He could be hiding it.”\nKelsier shook his head. “He nearly died in a raid a couple of years ago—\nif there were ever a time to show your powers, it would have been then.”\nVin nodded, still looking down, not meeting Kelsier’s eyes.\nHe sighed, sitting down on the slanted rooftop, one leg hanging over the\nside. “Have a seat.”\nVin settled herself on the tile roof across from him. Above, the cool mists\ncontinued to churn, and it had begun to drizzle slightly—but that wasn’t\nmuch different from the regular nightly humidity.\n“I can’t have you tailing me like this, Vin,” Kelsier said. “Do you\nremember our discussion about trust?”\n“If you trusted me, you’d tell me where you were going.”\n“Not necessarily,” Kelsier said. “Maybe I just don’t want you and the\nothers to worry about me.”\n“Everything you do is dangerous,” Vin said. “Why would we worry any\nmore if you told us specifics?”\n“Some tasks are even more dangerous than others,” Kelsier said quietly.\nVin paused, then glanced to the side, in the direction Kelsier had been\ngoing. Toward the center of the city.\nToward Kredik Shaw, the Hill of a Thousand Spires. The Lord Ruler’s\npalace.\n“You’re going to confront the Lord Ruler!” Vin said quietly. “You said\nlast week that you were going to pay him a visit.”\n“ ‘Visit’ is, perhaps, too strong a word,” Kelsier said. “I am going to the\npalace, but I sincerely hope I don’t run into the Lord Ruler himself. I’m not\nready for him yet. Regardless, you are going straight to Clubs’s shop.”\nVin nodded.\nKelsier frowned. “You’re just going to try and follow me again, aren’t\nyou?”\nVin paused, then she nodded again.\n“Why?”\n“Because I want to help,” Vin said quietly. “So far, my part in this all has\nessentially boiled down to going to a party.

I don’t really expect to live until the end of the year anyway.\n“You keep telling the others what an advantage it is to have two Mistborn\non the team. Well, it’s not going to be much of an advantage unless you\nactually let me be a Mistborn. How long are you going to wait? Until I’m\n‘ready’? I don’t think that will ever happen.”\nKelsier eyed her for a moment, then he smiled. “When we first met, half\nthe time I couldn’t get you to say a word. Now you’re lecturing me.”\nVin blushed. Finally, Kelsier sighed, reaching beneath his cloak to pull\nsomething out. “I can’t believe I’m considering this,” he muttered, handing\nher the bit of metal.\nVin studied the tiny, silvery ball of metal. It was so reflective and bright\nthat it almost seemed to be a drop of liquid, yet it was solid to the touch.\n“Atium,” Kelsier said. “Tenth, and most powerful, of the known\nAllomantic metals. That bead is worth more than the entire bag of boxings I\ngave you before.”\n“This little bit?” she asked with surprise.\nKelsier nodded. “Atium only comes from one place—the Pits of Hathsin\n—where the Lord Ruler controls its production and distribution. The Great\nHouses get to buy a monthly stipend of atium, which is one of the main\nways the Lord Ruler controls them. Go ahead and swallow it.”\nVin eyed the bit of metal, uncertain she wanted to waste something so\nvaluable.\n“You can’t sell it,” Kelsier said. “Thieving crews try, but they get tracked"

The Lord Ruler is very protective of his atium supply.”\nVin nodded, then swallowed the metal. Immediately, she felt a new well\nof power appear within her, waiting to be burned.\n“All right,” Kelsier said, standing. “Burn it as soon as I start walking.”\nVin nodded. As he began to walk forward, she drew upon her new well of\nstrength and burned atium.\nKelsier seemed to fuzz slightly to her eyes; then a translucent, wraithlike\nimage shot out into the mists in front of him. The image looked just like\nKelsier, and it walked just a few steps in front of him. A very faint, trailing\nafter-image extended from the duplicate back to Kelsier himself.\nIt was like . . . a reverse shadow. The duplicate did everything Kelsier did\n—except, the image moved first. It turned, and then Kelsier followed its\nsame path.\nThe image’s mouth began moving. A second later, Kelsier spoke. “Atium\nlets you see just a bit into the future. Or, at least, it lets you see what people\nare going to do a little bit in the future. In addition, it enhances your mind,\nallowing you to deal with the new information, allowing you to react more\nquickly and collectedly.”\nThe shadow stopped, then Kelsier walked up to it, stopping as well.\nSuddenly, the shadow reached out and slapped her, and Vin moved\nreflexively, putting her hand up just as Kelsier’s real hand began to move.\nShe caught his arm midswing.\n“While you’re burning atium,” he said, “nothing can surprise you. You\ncan swing a dagger, knowing confidently that your enemies will run right\ninto it. You can dodge attacks with ease because you’ll be able to see where\nevery blow will fall. Atium makes you quite nearly invincible. It enhances\nyour mind, making you able to make use of all the new information.”\nSuddenly, dozens of other images shot from Kelsier’s body. Each one\nsprang in a different direction, some striding across the roof, others jumping\ninto the air. Vin released his arm, rising and backing away in confusion.\n“I just burned atium too,” Kelsier said. “I can see what you’re going to\ndo, and that changes what I’m going to do—which in turn changes what\nyou’re going to do. The images reflect each of the possible actions we might\ntake.”\n“It’s confusing,” Vin said, watching the insane jumble of images, old\nones constantly fading, new ones constantly appearing.\nKelsier nodded. “The only way to defeat someone who is burning atium\nis to burn it yourself—that way, neither of you has an advantage.”\nThe images vanished.\n“What did you do?” Vin asked with a start.\n“Nothing,” Kelsier said. “Your atium probably ran out.”\nVin realized with surprise that he was right—the atium was gone. “It\nburns so quickly!”\nKelsier nodded, sitting down again. “That’s probably the fastest fortune\nyou’ve ever blown, eh?”\nVin nodded, stunned. “It seems like such a waste.”"

        "text": "burns so quickly!”\nKelsier nodded, sitting down again. “That’s probably the fastest fortune\nyou’ve ever blown, eh?”\nVin nodded, stunned. “It seems like such a waste.”\nKelsier shrugged. “Atium is only valuable because of Allomancy. So, if\nwe didn’t burn it, it wouldn’t be worth the fortune that it is. Of course, if we\ndo burn it, we make it even more rare. It’s kind of an interesting\nrelationship—ask Ham about it sometimes. He loves talking about atium\neconomics.\n“Anyway, any Mistborn you face will probably have atium. However,\nthey’ll be reluctant to use it. In addition, they won’t have swallowed it yet\n—atium is fragile, and your digestive juices will ruin it in a matter of hours.\nSo, you have to walk a line between conservation and effectiveness. If it\nlooks like your opponent is using atium, then you’d better use yours too—\nhowever, make sure he doesn’t lure you into using up your reserve before\nhe does.”\nVin nodded. “Does this mean you’re taking me tonight?”\n“I’ll probably regret it,” Kelsier said, sighing. “But I don’t see any way to\nmake you stay behind—short of tying you up, perhaps. But, I warn you Vin.\nThis could be dangerous. Very dangerous. I don’t intend to meet the Lord\nRuler, but I do intend to sneak into his stronghold. I think I know where we\nmight find a clue on how to defeat him.”\nVin smiled, stepping forward as Kelsier waved her toward him. He\nreached into his pouch and pulled out a vial, which he handed to her. It was\nlike regular Allomantic vials, except the liquid inside held only a single\ndrop of metal. The atium bead was several times larger than the one he had\ngiven her to practice on.\n“Don’t use it unless you have to,” Kelsier warned. “You need any other\nmetals?”\nVin nodded. “I burned up most of my steel getting here.”\nKelsier handed her another vial. “First, let’s go retrieve my coin pouch.”\nSometimes I wonder if I’m going mad.\nPerhaps it is due to the pressure of knowing that I must somehow bear the burden of an entire world. Perhaps it is caused by the death I have seen, the friends I have\nlost. The friends I have been forced to kill.\nEither way, I sometimes see shadows following me. Dark creatures that I don’t understand, nor wish to understand. Are they, perhaps, some figment of my overtaxed\nmind?\n14\nI they located the coin pouch. It wasn’t a hard rain, but it\nT STARTED RAINING JUST AFTER\nseemed to clear the mist slightly. Vin shivered, pulling up her hood,\ncrouching beside Kelsier on a rooftop. He didn’t pay the weather much\nheed, so neither did she. A little dampness wouldn’t hurt—in fact, it would\nprobably help, as the rainfall would cover the sounds of their approach.\nKredik Shaw lay before them. The peaked spires and sheer towers rose\nlike dark talons in the night. They varied greatly in thickness—some were\nwide enough to house stairwells and large rooms, but others were simply\nthin rods of steel jutting up into the sky. The variety gave the mass a"

The variety gave the mass a\ntwisted, off-center symmetry—an almost-balance.\nThe spikes and towers had a foreboding cast in the damp, misty night—\nlike the ash-blackened bones of a long-weathered carcass. Looking at them,\nVin thought she felt something . . . a depression, as if simply being close to\nthe building was enough to suck away her hope.\n“Our target is a tunnel complex at the base of one of the far right spires,”\nKelsier said, his voice barely carrying over the quiet hush of the falling rain.\n“We’re heading for a room at the very center of that complex.”\n“What’s inside?”\n“I don’t know,” Kelsier said. “That’s what we’re going to find out. Once\nevery three days—and today isn’t one of them—the Lord Ruler visits this\nchamber. He stays for three hours, then leaves. I tried to get in once before.\nThree years ago.”\n“The job,” Vin whispered. “The one that . . .”\n“Got me captured,” Kelsier said with a nod. “Yes. At the time, we\nthought that the Lord Ruler stored riches in the room. I don’t think that’s\ntrue, now, but I’m still curious. The way he visits is so regular, so . . . odd.\nSomething’s in that room, Vin. Something important. Maybe it holds the\nsecret to his power and immortality.”\n“Why do we need to worry about that?” Vin asked. “You have the\nEleventh Metal to defeat him, right?”\nKelsier frowned slightly. Vin waited for an answer, but he didn’t ever\ngive one. “I failed to get in last time, Vin,” he said instead. “We got close,\nbut we got there too easily. When we arrived, there were Inquisitors outside\nthe room. Waiting for us.”\n“Someone told them you were coming?”\nKelsier nodded. “We planned that job for months. We were\noverconfident, but we had reason to be. Mare and I were the best—the job\nshould have gone flawlessly.” Kelsier paused, then he turned to Vin.\n“Tonight, I didn’t plan at all. We’re just going in—we’ll quiet anyone who\ntries to stop us, then break into that room.”\nVin sat quietly, feeling the chill rainwater on her wet hands and damp\narms. Then she nodded.\nKelsier smiled slightly. “No objections?”\nVin shook her head. “I made you take me with you. It’s not my place to\nobject now.”\nKelsier chuckled. “Guess I’ve been hanging out with Breeze too long. I\njust don’t feel right unless someone tells me I’m crazy.”\nVin shrugged. However, as she moved on the rooftop, she felt it again—\nthe sense of depression coming from Kredik Shaw.\n“There is something, Kelsier,” she said. “The palace feels . . . wrong,\nsomehow.”\n“That’s the Lord Ruler,” Kelsier said. “He radiates like an incredibly\npowerful Soother, smothering the emotions of everyone who gets close to\nhim. Turn on your copper; that will make you immune.”\nVin nodded, burning copper. Immediately, the sensation went away."

Immediately, the sensation went away.\n“Good?” Kelsier asked.\nShe nodded again.\n“All right, then,” he said, giving her a handful of coins. “Stay close to\nme, and keep your atium handy—just in case.”\nWith that, he threw himself off the roof. Vin followed, her cloak tassels\nspraying rainwater. She burned pewter as she fell, and hit the ground with\nAllomantically strengthened legs.\nKelsier took off at a dash, and she followed. Her speed on the wet\ncobblestones would have been reckless, but her pewter-fueled muscles\nreacted with precision, strength, and balance. She ran in the wet, misty\nnight, burning tin and copper—one to let her see, the other to let her hide.\nKelsier rounded the palace complex. Oddly, the grounds had no outer\nwall. Of course they don’t. Who would dare attack the Lord Ruler?\nFlat space, covered in cobblestones, was all that surrounded the Hill of a\nThousand Spires. No tree, foliage, or structure stood to distract one’s eye\nfrom the disturbing, asymmetric collection of wings, towers, and spires that\nwas Kredik Shaw.\n“Here we go,” Kelsier whispered, his voice carrying to her tin-enhanced\nears. He turned, dashing directly toward a squat, bunkerlike section of the\npalace. As they approached, Vin saw a pair of guards standing by an ornate,\ngatelike door.\nKelsier was on the men in a flash, cutting one down with slashing knives.\nThe second man tried to cry out, but Kelsier jumped, slamming both feet\ninto the man’s chest. Thrown to the side by the inhumanly strong kick, the\nguard crashed into the wall, then slumped to the ground. Kelsier was on his\nfeet a second later, slamming his weight against the door and pushing it\nopen.\nWeak lanternlight spilled out of a stone corridor within. Kelsier ducked\nthrough the door. Vin dimmed her tin, then followed in a crouching dash,\nher heart pounding. Never, in all her time as a thief, had she done something\nlike this. Hers had been a life of sneaky burgling and scamming, not raids or\nmuggings. As she followed Kelsier down the corridor—their feet and cloaks\nleaving a wet trail on the smooth stonework—she nervously pulled out a\nglass dagger, gripping the leather-wrapped handle in a sweaty palm.\nA man stepped into the hallway just ahead, exiting what appeared to be\nsome sort of guard chamber. Kelsier jumped forward and elbowed the\nsoldier in the stomach, then slammed him against the wall. Even as the\nguard collapsed, Kelsier ducked into the room.\nVin followed, stepping into chaos. Kelsier Pulled a metal candelabrum\nfrom the corner up into his hands, then began to spin with it, striking down\nsoldier after soldier. Guards cried out, scrambling and grabbing staves from\nthe side of the room. A table covered in half-eaten meals was thrown to the\nside as men tried to make room."

A table covered in half-eaten meals was thrown to the\nside as men tried to make room.\nA soldier turned toward Vin, and she reacted without thinking. She\nburned steel and threw out a handful of coins. She Pushed, and the missiles\nshot forward, tearing through the guard’s flesh and dropping him.\nShe burned iron, Pulling the coins back to her hand. She turned with a\nbloodied fist, spraying the room with metal, dropping three soldiers. Kelsier\nfelled the last with his impromptu staff.\nI just killed four men, Vin thought, stunned. Before, Reen had always\ndone the killing.\nThere was rustling behind. Vin spun to see another squadron of soldiers\nenter through a door opposite her. To the side, Kelsier dropped his\ncandelabrum and stepped forward. The room’s four lanterns suddenly\nripped from their mountings, slamming directly toward him. He ducked to\nthe side, letting the lanterns crash together.\nThe room fell dark. Vin burned tin, her eyes adapting to light from the\ncorridor outside. The guards, however, stumbled to a halt.\nKelsier was amidst them a second later. Daggers flashing in the darkness.\nMen screaming. Then all was silent.\nVin stood surrounded by death, bloodied coins dribbling from her\nstunned fingers. She kept a tight grip on her dagger, however—if only to\nsteady her quivering arm.\nKelsier lay a hand on her shoulder, and she jumped.\n“These were evil men, Vin,” he said. “Every skaa knows in his heart that\nit is the greatest of crimes to take up arms in defense of the Final Empire.”\nVin nodded numbly. She felt . . . wrong. Maybe it was the death, but now\nthat she was actually within the building, she swore that she could still feel\nthe Lord Ruler’s power. Something seemed to Push her emotions, making\nher more depressed despite her copper.\n“Come. Time is short.” Kelsier took off again, hopping lithely over\ncorpses, and Vin felt herself following.\nI made him bring me, she thought. I wanted to fight, like him. I’m going\nto have to get used to this.\nThey dashed into a second corridor, and Kelsier jumped into the air. He\nlurched, then shot forward. Vin did the same, leaping and seeking an anchor\nfar down the corridor, then using it to Pull herself through the air.\nSide corridors whipped past, the air a rushing howl in her tin-enhanced\nears. Ahead, two soldiers stepped into the corridor. Kelsier slammed feet-\nfirst into one, then flipped up and rammed a dagger into the other’s neck.\nBoth men fell.\nNo metal, Vin thought, dropping to the ground. None of the guards in this\nplace wear metal. Hazekillers, they were called. Men trained to fight\nAllomancers.\nKelsier ducked down a side corridor, and Vin had to sprint to keep up\nwith him. She flared pewter, willing her legs to move faster. Ahead, Kelsier\npaused, and Vin lurched to a stop beside him.

Vin extinguished her tin, following Kelsier through the\narchway and into the room.\nSix braziers burned with open flames at the corners of the large, dome-\nroofed chamber. In contrast to the simple corridors, this room was covered\nwith silver-inlayed murals. Each obviously represented the Lord Ruler; they\nwere like the windows she had seen earlier, except less abstract. She saw a\nmountain. A large cavern. A pool of light.\nAnd something very dark.\nKelsier strode forward, and Vin turned. The center of the room was\ndominated by a small structure—a building within the building. Ornate,\nwith carved stone and flowing patterns, the single-story building stood\nreverently before them. All in all, the quiet, empty chamber gave Vin a\nstrange feeling of solemnity.\nKelsier walked forward, bare feet falling on smooth black marble. Vin\nfollowed in a nervous crouch; the room seemed empty, but there had to be\nother guards. Kelsier walked up to a large oaken door set into the inner\nbuilding, its surface carved with letterings Vin didn’t recognize. He reached\nout and pulled open the door.\nA Steel Inquisitor stood inside. The creature smiled, lips curling in an\neerie expression beneath the two massive spikes that had been pounded\npoint-first through its eyes.\nKelsier paused for just a moment. Then he yelled, “Vin, run!” as the\nInquisitor’s hand snapped forward, grabbing him by the throat.\nVin froze. To the sides, she saw two other black-robed Inquisitors stride\nthrough open archways. Tall, lean, and bald, they were also marked by their\nspikes and intricate Ministry eye tattoos.\nThe closest Inquisitor lifted Kelsier up into the air by his neck. “Kelsier,\nthe Survivor of Hathsin,” the creature said in a grinding voice. Then he\nturned toward Vin. “And . . . you. I’ve been looking for you. I’ll let this one\ndie quickly if you’ll tell me which nobleman spawned you, half-breed.”\nKelsier coughed, struggling for breath as he pried at the creature’s grip.\nThe Inquisitor turned, regarding Kelsier with spike-end eyes. Kelsier\ncoughed again, as if trying to say something, and the Inquisitor curiously\npulled Kelsier a bit closer.\nKelsier’s hand whipped out, ramming a dagger into the creature’s neck.\nAs the Inquisitor stumbled, Kelsier slammed his fist into the creature’s\nforearm, shattering the bone with a snap. The Inquisitor dropped him, and\nKelsier fell to the reflective marble floor, coughing.\nGasping for breath, Kelsier looked up at Vin with intense eyes. “I said\nrun!” he croaked, tossing something to her.\nVin paused, reaching out to catch the coin pouch. However, it lurched\nsuddenly in the air, shooting forward. Abruptly, she realized Kelsier wasn’t\nthrowing it to her, but at her."

Abruptly, she realized Kelsier wasn’t\nthrowing it to her, but at her.\nThe bag hit her in the chest. Pushed by Kelsier’s Allomancy, it hurled her\nacross the room—past the two surprised Inquisitors—until she finally\ndropped awkwardly to the floor, skidding on the marble.\nVin looked up, slightly dazed. In the distance, Kelsier regained his feet.\nThe main Inquisitor, however, didn’t seem very concerned about the dagger\nin his neck. The other two Inquisitors stood between her and Kelsier. One\nturned toward her, and Vin felt chilled by its horrifying, unnatural gaze.\n“RUN!” The word echoed in the domed chamber. And this time, finally, it\nstruck home.\nVin scrambled to her feet—fear shocking her, screaming at her, making\nher move. She dashed toward the nearest archway, uncertain if it was the\none she had come in through. She clutched Kelsier’s coin pouch and burned\niron, frantically seeking an anchor down the corridor.\nMust get away!\nShe grabbed the first bit of metal she saw and yanked, tearing herself off\nthe ground. She shot down the corridor at an uncontrolled speed, terror\nflaring her iron.\nShe lurched suddenly, and everything spun. She hit the ground at an\nawkward angle—her head slamming against the rough stone—then lay\ndizzily, wondering what had happened. The coin pouch . . . someone had\nPulled on it, using its metal to yank her backward.\nVin rolled over and saw a dark form shooting down the corridor. The\nInquisitor’s robes fluttered as he dropped lightly to his feet a short distance\nfrom Vin. He strode forward, his face impassive.\nVin flared tin and pewter, clearing her mind and pushing away the pain.\nShe whipped out a few coins, Pushing them at the Inquisitor.\nHe raised a hand, and both coins froze in the air. Vin’s own Push\nsuddenly threw her backward, and she tumbled across the stones, skidding\nand sliding.\nShe heard the coins pling against the floor as she came to a rest. She\nshook her head, a dozen new bruises flaring angrily across her body. The\nInquisitor stepped over the discarded coins, walking toward her with a\nsmooth gait.\nI have to get away! Even Kelsier had been afraid to face an Inquisitor. If\nhe couldn’t fight one, what chance did she have?\nNone. She dropped the pouch and jumped to her feet, then she ran,\nducking through the first doorway she saw. The room beyond was empty of\npeople, but a golden altar stood at its center. Between the altar, the four\ncandelabra at the corners, and the cluttering of other religious\nparaphernalia, the space was cramped.\nVin turned, Pulling a candelabrum into her hands, remembering Kelsier’s\ntrick from before. The Inquisitor stepped into the room, then raised an\nalmost amused hand, ripping the candelabra from her hands in an easy\nAllomantic Pull.\nHe’s so strong! Vin thought with horror.

He was probably steadying\nhimself by Pulling against the lantern brackets behind. However, the force\nof his Ironpulls was far more powerful than Kelsier’s had ever been.\nVin jumped, Pulling herself slightly up and over the altar. At the\ndoorway, the Inquisitor reached over to a bowl that sat atop a short pillar,\npulling out what appeared to be a handful of small metal triangles. They\nwere sharp on all sides, and they cut the creature’s hand in a dozen different\nplaces. He ignored the wounds, raising a bloody hand toward her.\nVin yelped, ducking behind the altar as pieces of metal sprayed against\nthe back wall.\n“You are trapped,” the Inquisitor said in a scratchy voice. “Come with\nme.”\nVin glanced to the side. There weren’t any other doors in the room. She\npeeked up, glancing at the Inquisitor, and a piece of metal shot at her face.\nShe Pushed against it, but the Inquisitor was too strong. She had to duck\nand let the metal go, lest his power pin her back against the wall.\nI’ll need something to block with. Something that isn’t made of metal.\nAs she heard the Inquisitor step into the room, she found what she\nneeded—a large, leather-bound book sitting beside the altar. She grabbed it,\nthen paused. There was no use in being rich if she died. She pulled out\nKelsier’s vial and downed the atium, then burned it.\nThe Inquisitor’s shadow stepped around the side of the altar, then the\nactual Inquisitor followed a second later. The atium-shadow opened its\nhand, and a spray of tiny, translucent daggers shot at her.\nVin raised her book as the real daggers followed. She swung the book\nthrough the shadow trails just as the real daggers shot toward her. She\ncaught every one, their sharp, jagged edges digging deeply into the book’s\nleather cover.\nThe Inquisitor paused, and she was rewarded by what seemed to be a\nlook of confusion on its twisted face. Then a hundred shadow images shot\nfrom his body.\nLord Ruler! Vin thought. He had atium too.\nNot pausing to worry about what that meant, Vin hopped over the altar,\ncarrying the book with her as protection against further missiles. The\nInquisitor spun, spike-eyes following her as she ducked back into the\nhallway.\nA squad of soldiers stood waiting for her. However, each one bore a\nfuture-shadow. Vin ducked between them, barely watching where their\nweapons would fall, somehow avoiding the attacks of twelve different men.\nAnd, for a moment, she almost forgot the pain and fear—and they were\nreplaced by an incredible sense of power. She dodged effortlessly, staves\nswinging above and beside her, each one missing by just inches. She was\ninvincible.\nShe spun through the ranks of the men, not bothering to kill or hurt them\n—she only wanted to escape. As she passed the last one, she turned around\na corner.\nAnd a second Inquisitor, his body springing with shadow images, stepped\nup and slammed something sharp into her lower side."

There was a sickening sound as the creature pulled\nhis weapon free of her body; it was a length of wood affixed with sharp\nobsidian blades. Vin grasped her side, stumbling backward, feeling a\nterrifying amount of warm blood seeping from the wound.\nThe Inquisitor looked familiar. The first one, from the other room, she\nthought through the pain. Does . . . that mean that Kelsier is dead?\n“Who is your father?” the Inquisitor asked.\nVin kept her hand at her side, trying to stop the blood. It was a large\nwound. A bad wound. She had seen such wounds before. They always\nkilled.\nYet, she still stood. Pewter, her confused mind thought. Flare pewter!\nShe did so, the metal giving her body strength, letting her stay on her\nfeet. The soldiers stepped back to let the second Inquisitor approach her\nfrom the side. Vin looked in horror from one Inquisitor to the other, both\ndescending upon her, blood pouring between her fingers and down her side.\nThe lead Inquisitor still carried the axelike weapon, its edge coated with\nblood. Her blood.\nI’m going to die, she thought with terror.\nAnd then she heard it. Rain. It was faint, but her tin-ears picked it out\nbehind her. She spun, lurching through a door, and was rewarded by the\nsight of a large archway on the other side of the room. Mist pooled at the\nroom’s floor, and rain slapped the stones outside.\nMust have been where the guards came from, she thought. She kept her\npewter flared, amazed at how well her body still worked, and stumbled out\ninto the rain, reflexively clutching the leather book to her chest.\n“You think to escape?” the lead Inquisitor asked from behind, his voice\namused.\nNumbly, Vin reached into the sky and Pulled against one of the palace’s\nmany spires. She heard the Inquisitor curse as she pitched into the air,\nhurling up into the dark night.\nThe thousand spires rose around her. She Pulled against one, then\nswitched to another. The rain was strong now, and it made the night black.\nThere was no mist to reflect ambient light, and the stars were hidden by\nclouds above. Vin couldn’t see where she was going; she had to use\nAllomancy to sense the metallic tips of the spires, and hope there was\nnothing in between.\nShe hit a spire, catching hold of it in the night and pulling to a stop.

At the same time, she Pushed against the book in her hands\n—it still had bits of metal embedded into its cover. The book continued in\nthe direction she had been going, metal lines glowing weakly in the night. It\nwas the only metal she had on her.\nVin caught the next spire lightly, trying to make as little sound as\npossible. She strained in the night, burning tin, the rainfall becoming a\nthunder in her ears. Over it, she thought she heard the distinct sound of\nsomething hitting a spire in the direction she had Pushed the book.\nThe Inquisitor had fallen for her ruse. Vin sighed, hanging from the spire,\nrain splattering her body. She made sure her copper was still burning,\nPulled lightly against the spire to hold herself in place, and ripped off a\npiece of her shirt to bandage the wound. Despite her numb mind, she\ncouldn’t help noticing how big the gash was.\nOh, Lord, she thought. Without pewter, she would have fallen\nunconscious long ago. She should be dead.\nSomething sounded in the darkness. Vin felt a chill, looking up. All was\nblack around her.\nIt can’t be. He can’t—\nSomething slammed into her spire. Vin cried out, jumping away. She\nPulled herself toward another spire, caught it weakly, then immediately\nPushed off again. The Inquisitor followed, thuds sounding as he jumped\nfrom spire to spire behind her.\nHe found me. He couldn’t see me, hear me, or sense me. But he found me.\nVin hit a spire, holding it by one hand, limply hanging in the night. Her\nstrength was nearly gone. I . . . have to get away . . . hide. . . .\nHer hands were numb, and her mind felt nearly the same. Her fingers\nslipped from the cold, wet metal of the spire, and she felt herself drop free\ninto the darkness.\nShe fell with the rain.\nHowever, she went only a short distance before thudding against\nsomething hard—the roof of a particularly tall bit of the palace. Dazed, she\nclimbed to her knees, crawling away from the spire, seeking a corner.\nHide . . . hide . . . hide . . .\nShe crawled weakly to the nook formed by another tower. She huddled\nagainst the dark corner, lying in a deep puddle of ashy rainwater, arms\nwrapped around herself. Her body was wet with rain and blood.\nShe thought, for just a moment, that she might have escaped.\nA dark form thumped to the rooftop. The rain was letting up, and her tin\nrevealed a head set with two spikes, a body cloaked in a dark robe.\nShe was too weak to move, too weak to do more than shiver in the\npuddle of water, clothing plastered to her skin. The Inquisitor turned toward\nher.\n“Such a small, troubling thing you are,” he said. He stepped forward, but\nVin could barely hear his words.\nIt was growing dark again . . . no, it was just her mind. Her vision grew\ndark, her eyes closing. Her wound didn’t hurt anymore. She couldn’t . . .\neven . . . think. . . ."

She forced her\neyes open.\n“Kelsier?” she whispered.\nBut it wasn’t Kelsier’s face that looked back at her, streaked with\nconcern. It was a different, kinder face. She sighed in relief, drifting away\nas the strong arms pulled her close, making her feel oddly safe in the\nterrible storms of night.\nI don’t know why Kwaan betrayed me. Even still, this event haunts my thoughts. He was the one who discovered me; he was the Terris philosopher who first called me the\nHero of Ages. It seems ironically surreal that now—after his long struggle to convince his colleagues—he is the only major Terris holy man to preach against my reign.\n15\n“Y ” Dockson demanded, bursting into the room. “You took Vin\nOU TOOK HER WITH YOU?\ninto Kredik Shaw? Are you bloody insane?”\n“Yes,” Kelsier snapped. “You’ve been right all along. I’m a madman. A\nlunatic. Perhaps I should have just died in the Pits and never come back to\nbother any of you!”\nDockson paused, taken aback by the force in Kelsier’s words. Kelsier\npounded the table in frustration, and the wood splintered from the force of\nthe blow. He still burned pewter, the metal helping him resist his several\nwounds. His mistcloak lay in tatters, his body sliced by a half-dozen\ndifferent small cuts. His entire right side burned with pain. He’d have a\nmassive bruise there, and he’d be lucky if none of his ribs were cracked.\nKelsier flared the pewter. The fire within felt good—it gave him a focus\nfor his anger and self-loathing. One of the apprentices worked quickly,\ntying a bandage around Kelsier’s largest gash. Clubs sat with Ham at the\nside of the kitchen; Breeze was away visiting a suburb.\n“By the Lord Ruler, Kelsier,” Dockson said quietly.\nEven Dockson, Kelsier thought. Even my oldest friend swears by the Lord\nRuler’s name. What are we doing? How can we face this?\n“There were three Inquisitors waiting for us, Dox,” Kelsier said.\nDockson paled. “And you left her there?”\n“She got out before I did. I tried to distract the Inquisitors as long as I\ncould, but . . .”\n“But?”\n“One of the three followed her. I couldn’t get to it—maybe the other two\nInquisitors were simply trying to keep me busy so that their companion\ncould find her.”\n“Three Inquisitors,” Dockson said, accepting a small cup of brandy from\none of the apprentices. He downed it.\n“We must have made too much noise going in,” Kelsier said. “Either that,\nor they were already there for some reason.

The rain outside picked up again, assaulting the\nbuilding with a reproachful fury.\n“So . . .” Ham said, “what of Vin?”\nKelsier glanced at Dockson, and saw pessimism in his eyes. Kelsier had\nbarely escaped, and he had years of training. If Vin was still in Kredik Shaw\n. . .\nKelsier felt a sharp, twisting pain in his chest. You let her die too. First\nMare, then Vin. How many more will you lead to slaughter before this is\nthrough?\n“She might be hiding somewhere in the city,” Kelsier said. “Afraid to\ncome to the shop because the Inquisitors are looking for her. Or . . . perhaps\nfor some reason she went back to Fellise.”\nMaybe she’s out there somewhere, dying alone in the rain.\n“Ham,” Kelsier said, “you and I are heading back to the palace. Dox, take\nLestibournes and visit other thieving crews. Maybe one of their scouts saw\nsomething. Clubs, send an apprentice to Renoux’s mansion to see if she\nwent there.”\nThe solemn group started to move, but Kelsier didn’t need to state the\nobvious. He and Ham wouldn’t be able to get close to Kredik Shaw without\nrunning afoul of guard patrols. Even if Vin was hiding in the city\nsomewhere, the Inquisitors would probably find her first. They would have\n—\nKelsier froze, his sudden jerk causing the others to pause. He’d heard\nsomething.\nHurried footsteps sounded as Lestibournes rushed down the stairs and\ninto the room, his lanky form wet with rain. “Someone’s coming! Out the\nnight with the calling!”\n“Vin?” Ham asked hopefully.\nLestibournes shook his head. “Big man. Robe.”\nThis is it, then. I’ve brought death to the crew—I’ve led the Inquisitors\nright to them.\nHam stood, picking up a wooden stave. Dockson pulled out a pair of\ndaggers, and Clubs’s six apprentices moved to the back of the room, eyes\nwide with fright.\nKelsier flared his metals.\nThe back door to the kitchen slammed open. A tall, dark form in wet\nrobes stood in the rain. And he carried a cloth-wrapped figure in his arms.\n“Sazed!” Kelsier said.\n“She is badly wounded,” Sazed said, stepping quickly into the room, his\nfine robes streaming with rainwater. “Master Hammond, I require some\npewter. Her supply is exhausted, I think.”\nHam rushed forward as Sazed set Vin on the kitchen table. Her skin was\nclammy and pale, her thin frame soaked and wet.\nShe’s so small, Kelsier thought. Barely more than a child. How could I\nhave thought to take her with me?\nShe bore a massive, bloody wound in her side. Sazed set something aside\n—a large book he’d been carrying in his arms beneath Vin—and accepted a\nvial from Hammond, then bent down and poured the liquid down the\nunconscious girl’s throat. The room fell silent, the sound of pounding rain\ncoming through the still open door."

The room fell silent, the sound of pounding rain\ncoming through the still open door.\nVin’s face flushed slightly with color, and her breathing seemed to steady.\nTo Kelsier’s Allomantic bronze senses, she began to pulse softly with a\nrhythm not unlike a second heartbeat.\n“Ah, good,” Sazed said, undoing Vin’s makeshift bandage. “I feared that\nher body was too unfamiliar with Allomancy to burn metals unconsciously.\nThere is hope for her, I think. Master Cladent, I shall require a pot of boiled\nwater, some bandages, and the medical bag from my rooms. Quickly, now!”\nClubs nodded, waving for his apprentices to do as instructed. Kelsier\ncringed as he watched Sazed’s work. The wound was bad—worse than any\nhe himself had survived. The cut went deeply into her gut; it was the type of\nwound that killed slowly, but consistently.\nVin, however, was no ordinary person—pewter would keep an\nAllomancer alive long after their body should have given out. In addition,\nSazed was no ordinary healer. Religious rites were not the only things that\nKeepers stored in their uncanny memories; their metalminds contained vast\nwealths of information on culture, philosophy, and science.\nClubs ushered his apprentices from the room as the surgery began. The\nprocedure took an alarming amount of time, Ham applying pressure to the\nwound as Sazed slowly stitched Vin’s insides back together. Finally, Sazed\nclosed the outer wound and applied a clean bandage, then asked Ham to\ncarefully carry the girl up to her bed.\nKelsier stood, watching Ham carry Vin’s weak, limp form out of the\nkitchen. Then, he turned to Sazed questioningly. Dockson sat in the corner,\nthe only other one still in the room.\nSazed shook his head gravely. “I do not know, Master Kelsier. She could\nsurvive. We will need to keep her supplied with pewter—it will help her\nbody make new blood. Even still, I have seen many strong men die from\nwounds smaller than this one.”\nKelsier nodded.\n“I arrived too late, I think,” Sazed said. “When I found her gone from\nRenoux’s mansion, I came to Luthadel as quickly as I could. I used up an\nentire metalmind to make the trip with haste. I was still too late. . . .”\n“No, my friend,” Kelsier said. “You’ve done well this night. Far better\nthan I.”\nSazed sighed, then reached over and fingered the large book he’d set\naside before beginning the surgery. The tome was wet with rainwater and\nblood. Kelsier regarded it, frowning. “What is that, anyway?”\n“I don’t know,” Sazed said. “I found it at the palace, while I was\nsearching for the child. It is written in Khlenni.”\nKhlenni, the language of Khlennium—the ancient, pre-Ascension\nhomeland of the Lord Ruler. Kelsier perked up a bit. “Can you translate it?”\n“Perhaps,” Sazed said, suddenly sounding very tired. “But . . . not for a"

After this evening, I shall need to rest.”\nKelsier nodded, calling for one of the apprentices to prepare Sazed a\nroom. The Terrisman nodded thankfully, then walked wearily up the stairs.\n“He saved more than Vin’s life tonight,” Dockson said, approaching\nquietly from behind. “What you did was stupid, even for you.”\n“I had to know, Dox,” he said. “I had to go back. What if the atium really\nis in there?”\n“You said that it isn’t.”\n“I said that,” Kelsier said with a nod, “and I’m mostly sure. But what if\nI’m wrong?”\n“That’s no excuse,” Dockson said angrily. “Now Vin is dying and the\nLord Ruler is alerted to us. Wasn’t it enough that you got Mare killed trying\nto get into that room?”\nKelsier paused, but he was too drained to feel any anger. He sighed,\nsitting down. “There’s more, Dox.”\nDockson frowned.\n“I’ve avoided talking about the Lord Ruler to the others,” Kelsier said,\n“but . . . I’m worried. The plan is good, but I have this terrible, haunting\nfeeling that we’ll never succeed as long as he’s alive. We can take his\nmoney, we can take his armies, we can trick him out of the city . . . but I\nstill worry that we won’t be able to stop him.”\nDockson frowned. “You’re serious about this Eleventh Metal business,\nthen?”\nKelsier nodded. “I searched for two years to find a way to kill him. Men\nhave tried everything—he ignores normal wounds, and decapitation only\nannoys him. A group of soldiers burned down his inn during one of the\nearly wars. The Lord Ruler walked out as barely more than a skeleton, then\nhealed in a matter of seconds.\n“Only the stories of the Eleventh Metal offered any hope. But I can’t\nmake it work! That’s why I had to go back to the palace. The Lord Ruler’s\nhiding something in that room—I can feel it. I can’t help thinking that if we\nknew what it was, we’d be able to stop him.”\n“You didn’t have to take Vin with you.”\n“She followed me,” Kelsier said. “I worried that she’d try to get in on her\nown if I left her. The girl has a headstrong streak, Dox—she hides it well,\nbut she’s blasted stubborn when she wants to be.”\nDockson sighed, then nodded quietly. “And we still don’t know what’s in\nthat room.”\nKelsier eyed the book Sazed had set on the table. The rainwater had\nmarked it, but the tome was obviously designed to endure. It was strapped\ntightly to prevent water from seeping in, and the cover was of well-cured\nleather.\n“No,” Kelsier finally said. “We don’t.” But we do have that, whatever it\nis.\n“Was it worth it, Kell?” Dockson asked. “Was this insane stunt really\nworth nearly getting yourself—and the child—killed?”"

They forget that I was no king when my quest began. Far from it.\nI think it would do men well to remember that this task was not begun by emperors, priests, prophets, or generals. It didn’t start in Khlennium or Kordel, nor did it\ncome from the great nations to the east or the fiery empire of the West.\nIt began in a small, unimportant town whose name would mean nothing to you. It began with a youth, the son of a blacksmith, who was unremarkable in every way\n—except, perhaps, in his ability to get into trouble.\nIt began with me.\n16\nW V told her that Reen had beaten her again. What had she\nHEN IN AWOKE, THE PAIN\ndone? Had she been too friendly to one of the other crewmembers? Had she\nmade a foolish comment, drawing the crewleader’s ire? She was to remain\nquiet, always quiet, staying away from the others, never calling attention to\nherself. Otherwise he would beat her. She had to learn, he said. She had to\nlearn. . . .\nBut, her pain seemed too strong for that. It had been a long time since she\ncould remember hurting this much.\nShe coughed slightly, opening her eyes. She lay in a bed that was far too\ncomfortable, and a lanky teenage boy sat in a chair beside her bed.\nLestibournes, she thought. That’s his name. I’m in Clubs’s shop.\nLestibournes jumped to his feet. “You’re awaking!”\nShe tried to speak, but just coughed again, and the boy hurriedly gave her\na cup of water. Vin sipped it thankfully, grimacing at the pain in her side. In\nfact, her entire body felt like it had been pummeled soundly.\n“Lestibournes,” she finally croaked.\n“Notting as the now,” he said. “Kelsier wasing the hit with my name;\nchanged it to Spook.”\n“Spook?” Vin asked. “It fits. How long have I been asleep?”\n“Two weeks,” the boy said. “Wait here.” He scrambled away, and she\ncould hear him calling out in the distance.\nTwo weeks? She sipped at the cup, trying to organize her muddled\nmemories. Reddish afternoon sunlight shone through the window, lighting\nthe room. She set the cup aside, checking her side, where she found a large\nwhite bandage.\nThat’s where the Inquisitor hit me, she thought. I should be dead.\nHer side was bruised and discolored from where she’d hit the roof after\nfalling, and her body bore a dozen other nicks, bruises, and scrapes. All in\nall, she felt absolutely terrible.\n“Vin!” Dockson said, stepping into the room. “You’re awake!”"

They chased us, and Kelsier fought—” She\nstopped, looking at Dockson. “Kelsier? Is he—”\n“Kell’s fine,” Breeze said. “He came out of the incident in far better\nshape than you did. He knows the palace fairly well, from the plans we\nmade three years ago, and he . . .”\nVin frowned as Dockson trailed off. “What?”\n“He said the Inquisitors didn’t seem very focused on killing him. They\nleft one to chase him, and sent two after you.”\nWhy? Vin thought. Did they simply want to concentrate their energy on\nthe weakest enemy first? Or, is there another reason? She sat back\nthoughtfully, working through the events of that night.\n“Sazed,” Vin she finally said. “He saved me. The Inquisitor was about to\nkill me, but . . . Dox, what is he?”\n“Sazed?” Dockson asked. “That’s probably a question I should let him\nanswer.”\n“Is he here?”\nDockson shook his head. “He had to return to Fellise. Breeze and Kell\nare out recruiting, and Ham left last week to inspect our army. He won’t be\nback for another month at least.”\nVin nodded, feeling drowsy.\n“Drink the rest of your water,” Dockson suggested. “There’s something\nin it to help with the pain.”\nVin downed the rest of the drink, then rolled over and let sleep take her\nagain.\nKelsier was there when she awoke. He sat on the stool by her bed, hands\nclasped with his elbows on his knees, watching her by the faint light of a\nlantern. He smiled when she opened her eyes. “Welcome back.”\nShe immediately reached for the cup of water on the bed-stand. “How’s\nthe job going?”\nHe shrugged. “The army is growing, and Renoux has begun to purchase\nweapons and supplies. Your suggestion regarding the Ministry turned out to\nbe a good one—we found Theron’s contact, and we’ve nearly negotiated a\ndeal that will let us place someone as a Ministry acolyte.”\n“Marsh?” Vin asked. “Will he do it himself?”\nKelsier nodded. “He’s always had a . . . certain fascination with the\nMinistry. If any skaa can pull off imitating an obligator, it will be Marsh.”\nVin nodded, sipping her drink. There was something different about\nKelsier. It was subtle—a slight alteration in his air and attitude. Things had\nchanged during her sickness.\n“Vin,” Kelsier said hesitantly. “I owe you an apology. I nearly got you\nkilled.”\nVin snorted quietly. “It’s not your fault. I made you take me.”"

Please accept the apology.”\nVin nodded quietly. “What do you need me to do now? The job has to go\nforward, right?”\nKelsier smiled. “Indeed it does. As soon as you’re up to it, I’d like you to\nmove back to Fellise. We created a cover story saying that Lady Valette has\ntaken sick, but rumors are starting to appear. The sooner you can be seen in\nthe flesh by visitors, the better.”\n“I can go tomorrow,” Vin said.\nKelsier chuckled. “I doubt it, but you can go soon. For now, just rest.” He\nstood, moving to leave.\n“Kelsier?” Vin asked, causing him to pause. He turned, looking at her.\nVin struggled to formulate what she wanted to say. “The palace . . . the\nInquisitors . . . We’re not invincible, are we?” She flushed; it sounded stupid\nwhen she said it that way.\nKelsier, however, just smiled. He seemed to understand what she meant.\n“No, Vin,” he said quietly. “We’re far from it.”\nVin watched the landscape pass outside her carriage window. The vehicle,\nsent from Mansion Renoux, had supposedly taken Lady Valette for a ride\nthrough Luthadel. In reality, it hadn’t picked up Vin until it had stopped\nbriefly by Clubs’s street. Now, however, her window shades were open,\nshowing her again to the world—assuming anyone cared.\nThe carriage made its way back toward Fellise. Kelsier had been right:\nShe’d had to rest three more days in Clubs’s shop before feeling strong\nenough to make the trip. In part, she’d waited simply because she had\ndreaded struggling into a noblewoman’s dresses with her bruised arms and\nwounded side.\nStill, it felt good to be up again. There had been something . . . wrong\nabout simply recovering in bed. Such a lengthy period of rest wouldn’t have\nbeen given to a regular thief; thieves either got back to work quickly or\nwere abandoned for dead. Those who couldn’t bring in money for food\ncouldn’t be allowed to take up space in the lair.\nBut, that isn’t the only way people live, Vin thought. She was still\nuncomfortable with that knowledge. It hadn’t mattered to Kelsier and the\nothers that she drained their resources—they hadn’t exploited her weakened\nstate, but had cared for her, each one spending time at her bedside. Most\nnotable among the vigilists had been the young Lestibournes. Vin didn’t\neven feel that she knew him very well, yet Kelsier said that the boy had\nspent hours watching over her during her coma.\nWhat did one make of a world where a crewleader agonized over his\npeople? In the underground, each person bore responsibility for what\nhappened to them—the weaker segment of a crew had to be allowed to die,\nlest they keep everyone else from earning enough to survive.

This entire plan will end in\ndisaster—and your death will be your own fault for not leaving when you\ncould.\nReen had left when he could. Perhaps he’d known that the Inquisitors\nwould eventually hunt her down for the powers she unwittingly possessed.\nHe always had known when to leave—it was no accident, she thought, that\nhe hadn’t ended up slaughtered with the rest of Camon’s crew.\nAnd yet, she ignored Reen’s promptings in her head, instead letting the\ncarriage pull her toward Fellise. It wasn’t that she felt completely secure in\nher place with Kelsier’s crew—indeed, in a way, her place with these\npeople was making her even more apprehensive. What if they stopped\nneeding her? What if she became useless to them?\nShe had to prove to them that she could do what they needed her to.\nThere were functions to attend, a society to infiltrate. She had so much work\nto do; she couldn’t afford to spend any more of it sleeping.\nIn addition, she needed to return to her Allomantic practice sessions. It\nhad only taken a few short months for her to grow dependent upon her\npowers, and she longed for the freedom of leaping through the mists, of\nPulling and Pushing her way through the skies. Kredik Shaw had taught her\nthat she wasn’t invincible—but Kelsier’s survival with barely a scratch\nproved that it was possible to be much better than she was. Vin needed to\npractice, to grow in strength, until she too could escape Inquisitors like\nKelsier had.\nThe carriage turned a bend and rolled into Fellise. The familiar, pastoral\nsuburb made Vin smile to herself, and she leaned against the open carriage\nwindow, feeling the breeze. With luck, some streetgoers would gossip that\nLady Valette had been seen riding through the city. She arrived at Mansion\nRenoux a few short turns later. A footman opened the door, and Vin was\nsurprised to see Lord Renoux himself waiting outside the carriage to help\nher down.\n“My lord?” she said, giving him her hand. “Surely you have more\nimportant things to attend to.”\n“Nonsense,” he said. “A lord must be allowed time to dote upon his\nfavored niece. How was your ride?”\nDoes he ever break character? He didn’t ask after the others in Luthadel,\nor give any indication that he knew of her wound.\n“It was refreshing, Uncle,” she said as they walked up the steps to the\nmansion doors. Vin was thankful for the pewter burning lightly in her\nstomach to give strength to her still weak legs. Kelsier had warned against\nusing it too much, lest she grow dependent upon its power, but she saw little\nalternative until she was healed.\n“That is wonderful,” Renoux said. “Perhaps, once you are feeling better,\nwe should take lunch together on the garden balcony.

Vin the thief\nwas nothing to a man such as Renoux, but Valette the socialite was another\nmatter.\n“Very good,” Renoux said, pausing inside the entryway. “However, let us\nattend to that on another day—for now, you would likely prefer to rest from\nyour journey.”\n“Actually, my lord, I’d like to visit Sazed. I have some matters I must\ndiscuss with the steward.”\n“Ah,” Renoux said. “You will find him in the library, working on one of\nmy projects.”\n“Thank you,” Vin said.\nRenoux nodded, then walked away, his dueling cane clicking against the\nwhite marble floor. Vin frowned, trying to decide if he was completely sane.\nCould someone really adopt a persona that wholly?\nYou do it, Vin reminded herself. When you become Lady Valette, you\nshow a completely different side of yourself.\nShe turned, flaring pewter to help her climb the northern set of stairs. She\nlet her flare lapse as she reached the top, returning to a normal burn. As\nKelsier said, it was dangerous to flare metals for too extended a period; an\nAllomancer could quickly make their body dependent.\nShe took a few breaths—climbing the stairs had been difficult, even with\npewter—then walked down the corridor to the library. Sazed sat at a desk\nbeside a small coal stove on the far side of the small room, writing on a pad\nof paper. He wore his standard steward’s robes, and a pair of thin spectacles\nsat at the end of his nose.\nVin paused in the doorway, regarding the man who had saved her life.\nWhy is he wearing spectacles? I’ve seen him read before without them. He\nseemed completely absorbed by his work, periodically studying a large\ntome on the desk, then turning to scribble notes on his pad.\n“You’re an Allomancer,” Vin said quietly.\nSazed paused, then set down his pen and turned. “What makes you say\nthat, Mistress Vin?”\n“You got to Luthadel too quickly.”\n“Lord Renoux keeps several swift messenger horses in his stables. I\ncould have taken one of those.”\n“You found me at the palace,” Vin said.\n“Kelsier told me of his plans, and I correctly assumed that you had\nfollowed him. Locating you was a stroke of luck, one that nearly took me\ntoo long to achieve.”\nVin frowned. “You killed the Inquisitor.”\n“Killed?” Sazed asked. “No, Mistress. It takes far more power than I\npossess to kill one of those monstrosities. I simply . . . distracted him.”\nVin stood in the doorway for a moment longer, trying to figure out why\nSazed was being so ambiguous. “So, are you an Allomancer or not?”\nHe smiled, then he pulled a stool out from beside the desk. “Please, sit\ndown.”\nVin did as requested, crossing the room and sitting on the stool, her back\nto a massive bookshelf."

Still, what proof have you that I am an Allomancer?”\n“You did things that couldn’t have been done without Allomancy.”\n“Oh? A Mistborn for two months, and already you know all that is\npossible in the world?”\nVin paused. Up until just recently, she hadn’t even known much about\nAllomancy. Perhaps there was more to the world than she had assumed.\nThere’s always another secret. Kelsier’s words.\n“So,” she said slowly, “what exactly is a ‘Keeper’?”\nSazed smiled. “Now, that is a far more clever question, Mistress. Keepers\nare . . . storehouses. We remember things, so that they can be used in the\nfuture.”\n“Like religions,” Vin said.\nSazed nodded. “Religious truths are my particular specialty.”\n“But, you remember other things too?”\nSazed nodded.\n“Like what?”\n“Well,” Sazed said, closing the tome he had been studying. “Languages,\nfor instance.”\nVin immediately recognized the glyph-covered cover. “The book I found\nin the palace! How did you get it?”\n“I happened across it while searching for you,” the Terrisman said. “It is\nwritten in a very old language, one that hasn’t been spoken regularly in\nnearly a millennium.”\n“But you speak it?” Vin asked.\nSazed nodded. “Enough to translate this, I think.”\n“And . . . how many languages do you know?”\n“A hundred and seventy-two,” Sazed said. “Most of them, such as\nKhlenni, are no longer spoken. The Lord Ruler’s unity movement of the\nfifth century made certain of that. The language people now speak is\nactually a distant dialect of Terris, the language of my homeland.”\nA hundred and seventy-two, Vin thought with amazement. “That . . .\nsounds impossible. One man couldn’t remember that much.”\n“Not one man,” Sazed said. “One Keeper. What I do is similar to\nAllomancy, but not the same. You draw power from metals. I . . . use them\nto create memories.”\n“How?” Vin asked.\nSazed shook his head. “Perhaps another time, Mistress. My kind . . . we\nprefer to maintain our secrets. The Lord Ruler hunts us with a remarkable,\nconfusing passion. We are far less threatening than Mistborn—yet, he\nignores Allomancers and seeks to destroy us, hating the Terris people\nbecause of us.”\n“Hating?” Vin asked. “You’re treated better than regular skaa. You’re\ngiven positions of respect.”\n“That is true, Mistress,” Sazed said. “But, in a way, the skaa are more\nfree. Most Terrismen are raised from birth to be stewards. There are very"

There are very\nfew of us left, and the Lord Ruler’s breeders control our reproduction. No\nTerrisman steward is allowed to have a family, or even to bear children.”\nVin snorted. “That seems like it would be hard to enforce.”\nSazed paused, hand laying on the cover of the large book. “Why, not at\nall,” he said with a frown. “All Terrisman stewards are eunuchs, child. I\nassumed you knew that.”\nVin froze, then she blushed furiously. “I . . . I’m . . . sorry. . . .”\n“Truly and surely, no apology is required. I was castrated soon after my\nbirth, as is standard for those who will be stewards. Often, I think I would\nhave easily traded my life for that of a common skaa. My people are less\nthan slaves . . . they’re fabricated automatons, created by breeding\nprograms, trained from birth to fulfill the Lord Ruler’s wishes.”\nVin continued to blush, cursing her lack of tact. Why hadn’t anyone told\nher? Sazed, however, didn’t seem offended—he never seemed to get angry\nabout anything.\nProbably a function of his . . . condition, Vin thought. That’s what the\nbreeders must want. Docile, even-tempered stewards.\n“But,” Vin said, frowning, “you’re a rebel, Sazed. You’re fighting the\nLord Ruler.”\n“I am something of a deviant,” Sazed said. “And, my people are not as\ncompletely subjugated as the Lord Ruler would believe, I think. We hide\nKeepers beneath his very eyes, and some of us even gather the courage to\nbreak our training.”\nHe paused, then shook his head. “It is not an easy thing, however. We are\na weak people, Mistress. We are eager to do as we are told, quick to seek\nsubjugation. Even I, whom you dub a rebel, immediately sought out a\nposition of stewardship and subservience. We are not so brave as we would\nwish, I think.”\n“You were brave enough to save me,” Vin said.\nSazed smiled. “Ah, but there was an element of obedience in that too. I\npromised Master Kelsier that I would see to your safety.”\nAh, she thought. She had wondered if he’d had a reason for his actions.\nAfter all, who would risk their life simply to save Vin? She sat for a\nmoment in thought, and Sazed turned back to his book. Finally, she spoke\nagain, drawing the Terrisman’s attention. “Sazed?”\n“Yes, Mistress?”\n“Who betrayed Kelsier three years ago?”\nSazed paused, then set down his fountain pen. “The facts are unclear,\nMistress. Most of the crew assumes it was Mare, I think.”\n“Mare?” Vin asked. “Kelsier’s wife?”\nSazed nodded. “Apparently, she was one of the only people who could\nhave done it. In addition, the Lord Ruler himself implicated her.”\n“But, wasn’t she sent to the Pits too?”"

I don’t think he ever knew if she was the\ntraitor or not.”\n“My brother said that anyone would betray you, if they had the right\nchance and a good enough motive.”\nSazed frowned. “Even if such a thing were true, I would not want to live\nbelieving it.”\nIt seems better than what happened to Kelsier: being turned over to the\nLord Ruler by one you thought you loved.\n“Kelsier is different lately,” Vin said. “He seems more reserved. Is that\nbecause he feels guilty for what happened to me?”\n“I suspect that is part of it,” Sazed said. “However, he is also coming to\nrealize that there is a large difference between heading a small crew of\nthieves and organizing a large rebellion. He can’t take the risks he once did.\nThe process is changing him for the better, I think.”\nVin wasn’t so certain. However, she remained silent, realizing with\nfrustration how tired she was. Even sitting on a stool seemed strenuous to\nher now.\n“Go and sleep, Mistress,” Sazed said, picking up his pen and relocating\nhis place in the tome with his finger. “You survived something that probably\nshould have killed you. Give your body the thanks it deserves; let it rest.”\nVin nodded tiredly, then climbed to her feet and left him scribbling\nquietly in the afternoon light.\nSometimes I wonder what would have happened if I’d remained there, in that lazy village of my birth. I’d have become a smith, like my father. Perhaps I’d have a family,\nsons of my own.\nPerhaps someone else would have come to carry this terrible burden. Someone who could bear it far better than I. Someone who deserved to be a hero.\n17\nB M R , Vin had never seen a cultivated garden. On\nEFORE COMING TO ANSION ENOUX\nburglaries or scouting missions, she had occasionally seen ornamental\nplants, but she’d never given them much heed—they, like many noble\ninterests, had seemed frivolous to her.\nShe hadn’t realized how beautiful the plants could be when arranged\ncarefully. Mansion Renoux’s garden balcony was a thin, oval structure that\noverlooked the grounds below. The gardens weren’t large—they required\ntoo much water and attention to form more than a thin perimeter around the\nback of the building.\nStill, they were marvelous. Instead of mundane browns and whites, the\ncultivated plants were of deeper, more vibrant colors—shades of red,\norange, and yellow, with the colors concentrated in their leaves. The\ngroundskeepers had planted them to make intricate, beautiful patterns.\nCloser to the balcony, exotic trees with colorful yellow leaves gave shade\nand protected from ashfalls. It was a very mild winter, and most of the trees\nstill held their leaves.

The air felt cool, and the rustling of branches in the\nwind was soothing.\nAlmost soothing enough, in fact, to make Vin forget how annoyed she\nwas.\n“Would you like more tea, child?” Lord Renoux asked. He didn’t wait for\nan answer; he simply waved for a servant to rush forward and refill her cup.\nVin sat on a plush cushion, her wicker chair designed for comfort. During\nthe last four weeks, her every whim and desire had been met. Servants\ncleaned up after her, primped her, fed her, and even helped bathe her.\nRenoux saw that anything she asked for was given her, and she certainly\nwasn’t expected to do anything strenuous, dangerous, or even slightly\ninconvenient.\nIn other words, her life was maddeningly boring. Before, her time at\nMansion Renoux had been monopolized by Sazed’s lessons and Kelsier’s\ntraining. She’d slept during the days, having only minimal contact with the\nmansion staff.\nNow, however, Allomancy—at least, the nighttime jumping kind—was\nforbidden her. Her wound was only partially healed, and too much motion\nreopened it. Sazed still gave her occasional lessons, but his time was\ndominated by translating the book. He spent long hours in the library,\nporing over its pages with an uncharacteristically excited air.\nHe’s found a new bit of lore, Vin thought. To a Keeper, that’s probably as\nintoxicating as streetspice.\nShe sipped at her tea with repressed petulance, eyeing the nearby\nservants. They seemed like scavenger birds, roosting and waiting for any\nopportunity to make Vin as comfortable—and as frustrated—as possible.\nRenoux wasn’t much help either. His idea of “taking lunch” with Vin was\nto sit and attend to his own duties—making notes on ledgers or dictating\nletters—while eating. Her attendance seemed important to him, but he\nrarely paid much attention to her other than to ask how her day had been.\nYet, she forced herself to act the part of a prim noblewoman. Lord\nRenoux had hired some new servants that didn’t know about the job—not\nhouse staff, but gardeners and workmen. Kelsier and Renoux had worried\nthat the other houses would grow suspicious if they couldn’t get at least a\nfew servant-spies onto the Renoux grounds. Kelsier didn’t see it as a danger\nto the job, but it did mean that Vin had to maintain her persona whenever\npossible.\nI can’t believe that people live like this, Vin thought as some servants\nbegan clearing away the meal. How can noblewomen fill their days with so\nmuch nothing? No wonder everyone’s eager to attend those balls!\n“Is your respite pleasant, dear?” Renoux asked, pouring over another\nledger.\n“Yes, Uncle,” Vin said through tight lips. “Quite.”\n“You should be up to a shopping trip soon,” Renoux said, looking up at\nher. “Perhaps you would like to visit Kenton Street? Get some new earrings\nto replace that pedestrian stud you wear?”\nVin reached a hand to her ear, where her mother’s earring still sat. “No,”\nshe said. “I’ll keep this.”\nRenoux frowned, but said no more, for a servant approached and drew"

That was the servants’ way of saying that a member of the\ncrew had arrived.\n“Ah, very good,” Renoux said. “Show them up, Tawnson.”\n“Yes, my lord.”\nA few minutes later, Kelsier, Breeze, Yeden, and Dockson walked out\nonto the balcony. Renoux discreetly waved to the servants, who closed the\nglass balcony doors and left the crew in privacy. Several men took up\nposition just inside, watching to make certain that the wrong people didn’t\nhave an opportunity to eavesdrop.\n“Are we interrupting your meal?” Dockson asked.\n“No!” Vin said quickly, cutting off Lord Renoux’s reply. “Sit, please.”\nKelsier strolled over to the balcony’s ledge, looking out over the garden\nand grounds. “Nice view you have here.”\n“Kelsier, is that wise?” Renoux asked. “Some of the gardeners are men\nfor whom I cannot vouch.”\nKelsier chuckled. “If they can recognize me from this distance, they\ndeserve more than the Great Houses are paying them.” However, he did\nleave the balcony edge, walking over to the table and spinning a chair, then\nsitting down on it the wrong way. Over the last few weeks, he had mostly\nreturned to his old, familiar self. Yet, there were still changes. He held\nmeetings more often, discussed more of his plans with the crew. He also\nstill seemed different, more . . . thoughtful.\nSazed was right, Vin thought. Our attack on the palace might have been\nnear-deadly for me, but it has changed Kelsier for the better.\n“We thought we’d have our meeting here this week,” Dockson said,\n“since you two rarely get to participate.”\n“That was most thoughtful of you, Master Dockson,” Lord Renoux said.\n“But your concern is unnecessary. We are doing just fine—”\n“No,” Vin interrupted. “No, we aren’t. Some of us need information.\nWhat’s happening with the crew? How is the recruitment going?”\nRenoux eyed her with dissatisfaction. Vin, however, ignored him. He’s\nnot really a lord, she told herself. He’s just another crewmember. My\nopinion counts as much as his! Now that the servants are gone, I can speak\nhow I want.\nKelsier chuckled. “Well, captivity’s made her a bit more outspoken, if\nnothing else.”\n“I don’t have anything to do,” Vin said. “It’s driving me insane.”\nBreeze set his cup of wine on the table. “Some would find your state\nquite enviable, Vin.”\n“Then they must already be insane.”\n“Oh, they’re mostly noblemen,” Kelsier said. “So, yes, they’re quite\nmad.”\n“The job,” Vin reminded. “What’s happening?”\n“Recruitment is still too slow,” Dockson said. “But we’re improving.”\n“We may have to sacrifice further security for numbers, Kelsier,” Yeden\nsaid."

I had a message from him just a few days ago. He’s\nimpressed with their progress.”\nBreeze snorted. “Be warned—Hammond does tend to be a bit optimistic\nabout these kinds of things. If the army were made up of one-legged mutes,\nhe would praise their balance and their listening skills.”\n“I should like to see the army,” Yeden said eagerly.\n“Soon,” Kelsier promised.\n“We should be able to get Marsh into the Ministry within the month,”\nDockson said, nodding to Sazed as the Terrisman passed their sentries and\nentered the balcony. “Hopefully, Marsh will be able to give some insight as\nto how to deal with the Steel Inquisitors.”\nVin shivered.\n“They are a concern,” Breeze agreed. “Considering what a couple of\nthem did to you two, I don’t envy capturing the palace with them in there.\nThey are as dangerous as Mistborn.”\n“More,” Vin said quietly.\n“Can the army really fight them?” Yeden asked uncomfortably. “I mean,\nthey’re supposed to be immortal, aren’t they?”\n“Marsh will find the answer,” Kelsier promised.\nYeden paused, then nodded, accepting Kelsier’s word.\nYes, changed indeed, Vin thought. It appeared that not even Yeden could\nresist Kelsier’s charisma for an extended period of time.\n“In the meantime,” Kelsier said, “I’m hoping to hear what Sazed has\nlearned about the Lord Ruler.”\nSazed sat, laying his tome on the tabletop. “I will tell you what I can,\nthough this is not the book that I first assumed it to be. I thought that\nMistress Vin had recovered some ancient religious text—but it is of a far\nmore mundane nature.”\n“Mundane?” Dockson asked. “How?”\n“It is a journal, Master Dockson,” Sazed said. “A record that appears to\nhave been penned by the Lord Ruler himself—or, rather, the man who\nbecame the Lord Ruler. Even Ministry teachings agree that before the\nAscension, he was a mortal man.\n“This book tells of his life just prior to his final battle at the Well of\nAscension a thousand years ago. Mostly, it is a record of his travels—a\nnarration of the people he met, the places he visited, and the trials he faced\nduring his quest.”\n“Interesting,” Breeze said, “but how does it help us?”\n“I am not certain, Master Ladrian,” Sazed said. “However, understanding\nthe real history behind the Ascension will be of use, I think.

In addition, the Lord Ruler it depicts is\nvery conflicted. If the Ministry were going to devise a book for worship,\nthey would present their god with more . . . divinity, I think.”\n“I’ll want to read it when you are done, Saze,” Dockson said.\n“And I,” Breeze said.\n“Some of Clubs’s apprentices occasionally work as scribes,” Kelsier said.\n“We’ll have them make a copy for each of you.”\n“Handy lot, those,” Dockson noted.\nKelsier nodded. “So, where does that leave us?”\nThe group paused, then Dockson nodded to Vin. “With the nobility.”\nKelsier frowned slightly.\n“I can go back to work,” Vin said quickly. “I’m mostly healed, now.”\nKelsier shot a look at Sazed, who raised an eyebrow. He checked on her\nwound periodically. Apparently, he didn’t like what he saw.\n“Kell,” Vin said. “I’m going insane. I grew up as a thief, scrambling for\nfood and space—I can’t just sit around and let these servants pamper me.”\nBesides, I have to prove that I can still be useful to this crew.\n“Well,” Kelsier said. “You’re one of the reasons we came here today.\nThere’s a ball this weekend that—”\n“I’ll go,” Vin said.\nKelsier held up a finger. “Hear me out, Vin. You’ve been through a lot\nlately, and this infiltration could get dangerous.”\n“Kelsier,” Vin said flatly. “My whole life has been dangerous. I’m\ngoing.”\nKelsier didn’t look convinced.\n“She has to do it, Kell,” Dockson said. “For one thing, the nobility is\ngoing to get suspicious if she doesn’t start going to parties again. For\nanother, we need to know what she sees. Having servant spies on the staff\nisn’t the same as having a spy listening to local plots. You know that.”\n“All right, then,” Kelsier finally said. “But you have to promise not to use\nphysical Allomancy until Sazed says otherwise.”\nLater that evening, Vin still couldn’t believe how eager she was to go the\nball. She stood in her room, looking over the different gown ensembles that\nDockson had found for her. Since she had been forced to wear\nnoblewoman’s attire for a good month straight, she was beginning to find\ndresses just a shade more comfortable than she once had.\nNot that they aren’t frivolous, of course, she thought, inspecting the four\ngowns.

Most of the other women wore colorful\ndresses; muted colors seemed reserved for men’s suits. She eyed a yellow\ngown, but it just seemed a little too . . . perky. And the white one was too\nornate.\nThat left the red. The neckline was lower—not that she had a lot to show\n—but it was beautiful. A bit gossamer, with full sleeves that were made of\ntranslucent mesh in places, it enticed her. But it seemed so . . . blatant.

She no longer\nlooked quite so scrawny in the mirror, despite her lengthy sickness; regular\nmeals had filled her out.\nI’m becoming . . . Vin paused.

The sun was close to setting; soon, the\nmists would come—though, as usual, Sazed would have guards posted to\nmake certain that she didn’t go on any unauthorized Allomantic romps.

She walked\nforward, joining him at the carved stone balcony railing.\nHe turned and looked westward—not at the grounds, but beyond them.\nToward the wilderness, lit by a setting sun, outside of town. “Does it ever\nlook wrong to you, Vin?”\n“Wrong?” she asked.\nKelsier nodded. “The dry plants, the angry sun, the smoky-black sky.”\nVin shrugged. “How can those things be right or wrong? That’s just the\nway things are.”\n“I suppose,” Kelsier said. “But, I think your mind-set is part of the\nwrongness.

He\nunfolded it with a gentle touch, then handed it to Vin.\nShe accepted the sheet, holding it carefully; it was so old and worn that it\nseemed close to breaking at the creases.

It didn’t have a\nthick stalk, and its leaves were far too delicate. At its top, it had a strange\ncollection of leaves that were a different color from the rest.\n“It’s called a flower,” Kelsier said. “They used to grow on plants, before\nthe Ascension. Descriptions of them appear in the old poems and stories—\nthings that only Keepers and rebel sages know about anymore. Apparently,\nthese plants were beautiful, and they had a pleasant smell.”\n“Plants that smell?” Vin asked. “Like fruit?”\n“Something like that, I think. Some of the reports even claim that these\nflowers grew into fruit, in the days before the Ascension.”\nVin stood quietly, frowning, trying to imagine such a thing.\n“That picture belonged to my wife, Mare,” Kelsier said quietly.\n“Dockson found it in her things after we were taken. He kept it, hoping that\nwe would return. He gave it to me after I escaped.”\nVin looked down at the picture again.\n“Mare was fascinated by pre-Ascension times,” Kelsier said, still staring\nout over the gardens. In the distance, the sun touched the horizon, and grew\nan even deeper red. “She collected things like that paper: pictures and\ndescriptions of the old times. I think that fascination—along with the fact\nthat she was a Tineye—is part of what led her to the underground, and to\nme. She’s the one who first introduced me to Sazed, though I didn’t use him\nin my crew at the time. He wasn’t interested in thieving.”\nVin folded up the paper. “And you keep this picture still? After . . . what\nshe did to you?”\nKelsier fell silent for a moment. Then he eyed her. “Been listening at"

Then he eyed her. “Been listening at\ndoors again, have we? Oh, don’t worry. I suppose it’s common enough\nknowledge.” In the distance, the setting sun became a blaze, its ruddy light\nilluminating clouds and smoke alike.\n“Yes, I keep the flower,” Kelsier said. “I’m not really sure why. But . . .\ndo you stop loving someone just because they betray you? I don’t think so.\nThat’s what makes the betrayal hurt so much—pain, frustration, anger . . .\nand I still loved her. I still do.”\n“How?” Vin asked. “How can you? And, how can you possibly trust\npeople? Didn’t you learn from what she did to you?”\nKelsier shrugged. “I think . . . I think given the choice between loving\nMare—betrayal included—and never knowing her, I’d choose love. I\nrisked, and I lost, but the risk was still worth it. It’s the same with my\nfriends. Suspicion is healthy in our profession—but only to an extent. I’d\nrather trust my men than worry about what will happen if they turn on me.”\n“That sounds foolish,” Vin said.\n“Is happiness foolish?” Kelsier asked, turning toward her. “Where have\nyou been happier, Vin? On my crew, or back with Camon?”\nVin paused.\n“I don’t know for sure if Mare betrayed me,” Kelsier said, looking back\nat the sunset. “She always claimed that she didn’t.”\n“And she was sent to the Pits, right?” Vin said. “That doesn’t make sense,\nif she sided with the Lord Ruler.”\nKelsier shook his head, still staring into the distance. “She showed up at\nthe Pits a few weeks after I was sent there—we were separated, after we\nwere caught. I don’t know what happened during that time, or why she was\neventually sent to Hathsin. The fact that she was sent to die hints that\nmaybe she really didn’t betray me, but . . .”\nHe turned toward Vin. “You didn’t hear him when he caught us, Vin. The\nLord Ruler . . . he thanked her. Thanked her for betraying me. His words—\nspoken with such an eerie sense of honesty—mixed with the way that the\nplan was set up . . . well, it was hard to believe Mare. That didn’t change\nmy love, though—not deep down. I nearly died when she did a year later,\nbeaten before the slavemasters at the Pits. That night, after her corpse was\ntaken away, I Snapped.”\n“You went mad?” Vin asked.\n“No,” Kelsier said. “Snapping is an Allomantic term. Our powers are\nlatent at first—they only come out after some traumatic event. Something\nintense—something almost deadly. The philosophers say that a man can’t\ncommand the metals until he has seen death and rejected it.”\n“So . . . when did it happen to me?” Vin asked.\nKelsier shrugged. “It’s hard to tell. Growing up as you did, there were\nprobably ample opportunities for you to Snap.”"

Growing up as you did, there were\nprobably ample opportunities for you to Snap.”\nHe nodded as if to himself. “For me,” he said, “it was that night. Alone in\nthe Pits, my arms bleeding from the day’s work. Mare was dead, and I\nfeared that I was responsible—that my lack of faith took away her strength\nand will. She died knowing that I questioned her loyalty. Maybe, if I’d\nreally loved her, I wouldn’t have ever questioned. I don’t know.”\n“But, you didn’t die,” Vin said.\nKelsier shook his head. “I decided that I’d see her dream fulfilled. I’d\nmake a world where flowers returned, a world with green plants, a world\nwhere no soot fell from the sky. . . .” He trailed off, then sighed. “I know.\nI’m insane.”\n“Actually,” Vin said quietly, “it kind of makes sense. Finally.”\nKelsier smiled. The sun sank beneath the horizon, and while its light was\nstill a flare in the west, the mists began to appear. They didn’t come from\none specific place, they just sort of . . . grew. They extended like\ntranslucent, twisting vines in the sky—curling back and forth, lengthening,\ndancing, melding.\n“Mare wanted children,” Kelsier said suddenly. “Back when we were\nfirst married, a decade and a half ago. I . . . didn’t agree with her. I wanted\nto become the most famous skaa thief of all time, and didn’t have time for\nthings that would slow me down.\n“It’s probably a good thing that we didn’t have children. The Lord Ruler\nmight have found and killed them. But, he might not have—Dox and the\nothers survived. Now, sometimes, I wish that I had a piece of her with me.\nA child. A daughter, perhaps, with Mare’s same dark hair and resilient\nstubbornness.”\nHe paused, then looked down at Vin. “I don’t want to be responsible for\nsomething happening to you, Vin. Not again.”\nVin frowned. “I’m not spending any more time locked in this mansion.”\n“No, I don’t suppose you will. If we try and keep you in much longer,\nyou’ll probably just show up at Clubs’s shop one night having done\nsomething very foolish. We’re a bit too much alike that way, you and I. Just\n. . . be careful.”\nVin nodded. “I will.”\nThey stood for a few more minutes, watching the mists gather. Finally,\nKelsier stood up straight, stretching. “Well, for what it’s worth, I’m glad\nyou decided to join us, Vin.”\nVin shrugged. “To tell you the truth, I’d kind of like to see one of those\nflowers for myself.”\nYou could say that circumstances forced me to leave my home behind—certainly, if I had stayed, I would now be dead. During those days—running without knowing why,\ncarrying a burden I didn’t understand—I assumed that I would lose myself in Khlennium and seek a life of indistinction.\nI am slowly coming to understand that anonymity, like so many other things, has already been lost to me forever.\n18"

It was definitely the boldest choice, but that felt\nHE DECIDED TO WEAR THE\nright. After all, she hid her true self behind an aristocratic appearance; the\nmore visible that appearance was, the easier it should be for her to hide.\nA footman opened the carriage door. Vin took a deep breath—chest a\nlittle confined by the special corset she was wearing to hide her bandages—\nthen accepted the footman’s hand and climbed down. She straightened her\ndress, nodded to Sazed, then joined the other aristocrats making their way\nup the steps to Keep Elariel. It was a bit smaller than the keep of House\nVenture. However, Keep Elariel apparently had a separate party ballroom,\nwhile House Venture had its gatherings in the enormous main hall.\nVin eyed the other noblewomen, and felt a bit of her confidence vanish.\nHer dress was beautiful, but the other women had so much more than just\ngowns. Their long, flowing hair and self-assured airs matched their\nbejeweled figures. They filled out the upper portions of their dresses with\nvoluptuous curves, and moved elegantly in the frilled splendor of the lower\nfolds. Vin occasionally caught glimpses of the women’s feet, and they\ndidn’t wear simple slippers like her own, but rather high-heeled shoes.\n“Why don’t I have shoes like that?” she asked quietly as they climbed the\ncarpet-covered stairs.\n“Heels take practice to walk in, Mistress,” Sazed replied. “Since you’ve\nonly just learned to dance, it might be best if you wore regular shoes for a\ntime.”\nVin frowned, but accepted the explanation. Sazed’s mention of dancing,\nhowever, increased her discomfort. She remembered the flowing poise of\nthe dancers at her last ball. She certainly wouldn’t be able to imitate that—\nshe barely even knew the basic steps.\nThat won’t matter, she thought. They won’t see me—they’ll see Lady\nValette. She’s supposed to be new and uncertain, and everyone thinks she’s\nbeen ill lately. It will make sense for her to be a poor dancer.\nThat thought in mind, Vin reached the top of the stairs feeling a bit more\nsecure.\n“I must say, Mistress,” Sazed said. “You seem far less nervous this time\n—in fact, you even seem excited. This is the proper attitude for Valette to\ndisplay, I think.”\n“Thank you,” she said, smiling. He was right: She was excited. Excited\nto be part of the job again—excited, even, to be back among the nobility,\nwith their splendor and grace.\nThey stepped up to the squat ballroom building—one of several low\nwings extending from the main keep—and a servant took her shawl. Vin\npaused a moment just inside the doorway, waiting as Sazed arranged her\ntable and meal.\nThe Elariel ballroom was very different from the majestic Venture grand\nhall. The dim room was only a single story high, and while it had a lot of\nstained-glass windows, they were all in the ceiling. Circular rose-window\nskylights shone from above, lit by small limelights on the roof. Each table"

Each table\nwas set with candles, and despite the light from above, there was a reserved\ndarkness about the room. It seemed . . . private, despite the numerous\npeople in attendance.\nThis room had obviously been designed to accommodate parties. A\nsunken dancing floor lay at its center, and this was better lit than the rest of\nthe room. There were two tiers of tables circling the dancing floor: The first\ntier was only a few feet above, the other was farther back and about twice\nas high.\nA servant led her to a table at the rim of the room. She sat, Sazed taking\nhis customary place beside her, and began to wait for her meal to arrive.\n“How exactly am I supposed to get the information Kelsier wants?” she\nasked quietly, scanning the dark room. The deep, crystalline colors from\nabove projected patterns across tables and people, creating an impressive\natmosphere, yet making it difficult to distinguish faces. Was Elend here\nsomewhere amidst the ball-goers?\n“Tonight, some men should ask you to dance,” Sazed said. “Accept their\ninvitations—this will give you an excuse to seek them out later and mingle\nin their groups. You don’t need to participate in conversations—you just\nhave to listen. At future balls, perhaps some of the young men will begin to\nask you to accompany them. Then you’ll be able to sit at their table and\nlisten to all of their discussions.”\n“You mean, sit with one man the entire time?”\nSazed nodded. “It’s not uncommon. You would dance only with him that\nnight as well.”\nVin frowned. However, she let the matter drop, turning to inspect the\nroom again. He’s probably not even here—he said he avoided balls when\npossible. Even if he were here, he’d be off on his own. You won’t even—\nA muted thump sounded as someone dropped a stack of books onto her\ntable. Vin jumped in startlement, turning as Elend Venture pulled over a\nchair, then sat down with a relaxed posture. He leaned back in the chair,\nangling toward a candelabrum beside her table, and opened a book to begin\nreading.\nSazed frowned. Vin hid a smile, eyeing Elend. He still didn’t look as if he\nhad bothered to brush his hair, and again wore his suit without the buttons\ndone up. The garment wasn’t shabby, but nor was it as rich as others at the\nparty. It seemed to have been tailored to be loose and relaxed, defying the\ntraditional sharp, well-cut fashion.\nElend flipped through his book. Vin waited patiently for him to\nacknowledge her, but he just continued to read. Finally, Vin raised an\neyebrow. “I don’t remember giving you permission to sit at my table, Lord\nVenture,” she said.\n“Don’t mind me,” Elend said, not looking up. “You’ve got a big table—\nthere’s plenty of room for both of us.”\n“Both of us, perhaps,” Vin said. “But I’m not sure about those books.\nWhere are the servers going to put my meal?”\n“There’s a bit of space to your left,” Elend said offhandedly."

He stepped forward, gathering up the books and\nsetting them on the floor beside Elend’s chair.\nElend continued to read. He did, however, raise a hand to gesture. “See,\nnow, that’s why I don’t ever use Terrismen servants. They’re an insufferably\nefficient lot, I must say.”\n“Sazed is hardly insufferable,” Vin said coolly. “He is a good friend, and\nis probably a better man than you will ever be, Lord Venture.”\nElend finally looked up. “I’m . . . sorry,” he said in a frank tone. “I\napologize.”\nVin nodded. Elend, however, opened his book and began reading again.\nWhy sit with me if he’s just going to read? “What did you do at these\nparties before you had me to pester?” she asked in an annoyed tone.\n“See, now, how can I be pestering you?” he asked. “I mean, really,\nValette. I’m just sitting here, reading quietly to myself.”\n“At my table. I’m certain you could get your own—you’re the Venture\nheir. Not that you were forthcoming about that fact during our last\nmeeting.”\n“True,” Elend said. “I do, however, recall telling you that the Ventures\nwere an annoying lot. I’m just trying to live up to the description.”\n“You’re the one that made up the description!”\n“Convenient, that,” Elend said, smiling slightly as he read.\nVin sighed in frustration, scowling.\nElend peeked up over his book. “That’s a stunning dress. It’s almost as\nbeautiful as you are.”\nVin froze, jaw hanging open slightly. Elend smiled mischievously, then\nturned back to his book, eyes sparkling as if to indicate that he’d made the\ncomment simply because he knew the reaction he’d get.\nSazed loomed over the table, not bothering to mask his disapproval. Yet,\nhe said nothing. Elend was obviously too important to be chastised by a\nsimple steward.\nVin finally found her tongue. “How is it, Lord Venture, that an eligible\nman like yourself comes to these balls alone?”\n“Oh, I don’t,” Elend said. “My family usually has one girl or another\nlined up to accompany me. Tonight’s fare is the Lady Stase Blanches—\nshe’s the one in the green dress sitting on the lower tier across from us.”\nVin glanced across the room. Lady Blanches was a gorgeous blond\nwoman. She kept glancing up at Vin’s table, covering a scowl.\nVin flushed, turning away. “Um, shouldn’t you be down there with her?”\n“Probably,” Elend said. “But, see, I’ll tell you a secret. The truth is, I’m\nnot really much of a gentleman. Besides, I didn’t invite her—it wasn’t until\nI got into the carriage that I was informed regarding my accompaniment.”\n“I see,” Vin said with a frown.\n“My behavior is, nonetheless, deplorable.

Unfortunately, I’m quite prone\nto such bouts of deplorability—take, for instance, my fondness for reading\nbooks at the dinner table. Excuse me for a moment; I’m going to go get\nsomething to drink.”\nHe stood, tucking the book into his pocket, and walked toward one of the\nroom’s bar tables. Vin watched him go, both annoyed and bemused.\n“This is not good, Mistress,” Sazed said in a low tone.\n“He’s not that bad.”\n“He’s using you, Mistress,” Sazed said. “Lord Venture is infamous for his\nunconventional, disobedient attitude. Many people dislike him—precisely\nbecause he does things like this.”\n“Like this?”\n“He is sitting with you because he knows that it will annoy his family,”\nSazed said. “Oh, child—I do not wish to bring you pain, but you must\nunderstand the ways of the court. This young man is not romantically\ninterested in you. He is a young, arrogant lord who chafes at his father’s\nrestrictions—so he rebels, acting rude and offensive. He knows that his\nfather will relent if he acts spoiled enough for long enough.”\nVin felt her stomach twist. Sazed’s probably right, of course. Why else\nwould Elend seek me out? I’m exactly what he needs—someone lowborn\nenough to annoy his father, but inexperienced enough not to see the truth.\nHer meal arrived, but Vin didn’t have much of an appetite anymore. She\nbegan to pick at the food as Elend returned, settling down with a large\ngoblet filled with some mixed drink. He sipped as he read.\nLet’s see how he reacts if I don’t interrupt his reading, Vin thought in\nannoyance, remembering her lessons, and eating her food with a lady’s\ngrace. It wasn’t a large meal—mostly some rich, buttered vegetables—and\nthe sooner she finished, the sooner she could get to dancing. At least then\nshe wouldn’t have to sit with Elend Venture.\nThe young lord paused several times as she ate, peeking at her over the\ntop of his book. He obviously expected her to say something, but she never\ndid. As she ate, however, her anger faded. She glanced at Elend, studying\nhis slightly disheveled appearance, watching the earnestness with which he\nread his book. Could this man really hide the twisted sense of manipulation\nSazed implied? Was he really just using her?\nAnyone will betray you, Reen whispered. Everyone will betray you.\nElend just seemed so . . . genuine. He felt like a real person, not a front or\na face. And it did seem like he wanted her to talk to him. It felt like a\npersonal victory to Vin when he finally sat the book down and looked at her.\n“Why are you here, Valette?” he asked.\n“Here at the party?”\n“No, here in Luthadel.”\n“Because it’s the center of everything,” Vin said.\nElend frowned. “I suppose it is. But, the empire is a big place to have\nsuch a small center. I don’t think we really understand how large it is. How\nlong did it take you to get here?”"

How\nlong did it take you to get here?”\nVin felt a moment of panic, but Sazed’s lessons snapped quickly into her\nmind. “Almost two months by canal, with some stops.”\n“Such a long time,” Elend said. “They say it can take half a year to travel\nfrom one end of the empire to the other, yet most of us ignore everything\nbut this little bit at the center.”\n“I . . .” Vin trailed off. With Reen, she’d been all across the Central\nDominance. It was the smallest of the dominances, however, and she’d\nnever visited the more exotic places in the empire. This central area was\ngood for thieves; oddly, the place closest to the Lord Ruler was also the one\nwith the most corruption, not to mention the most riches.\n“What do you think of the city, then?” Elend asked.\nVin paused. “It’s . . . dirty,” she said honestly. In the dim light, a servant\narrived to remove her empty plate. “It’s dirty, and it’s full. The skaa are\ntreated terribly, but I guess that’s true everywhere.”\nElend cocked his head, giving her a strange look.\nI shouldn’t have mentioned the skaa. That wasn’t very noble-like.\nHe leaned forward. “You think the skaa here are treated worse than the\nones on your plantation? I always thought they would be better off in the\ncity.”\n“Um . . . I’m not sure. I didn’t go to the fields very often.”\n“So, you didn’t interact with them very much?”\nVin shrugged. “Why does it matter? They’re just skaa.”\n“See, now, that’s what we always say,” Elend said. “But I don’t know.\nMaybe I’m too curious, but they interest me. Did you ever hear them talk to\none another? Did they sound like regular people?”\n“What?” Vin asked. “Of course they did. What else would they sound\nlike?”\n“Well, you know what the Ministry teaches.”\nShe didn’t. However, if it was regarding the skaa, it probably wasn’t\nflattering. “I make it a rule to never completely believe anything the\nMinistry says.”\nElend paused again, cocking his head. “You’re . . . not what I expected,\nLady Valette.”\n“People rarely are.”\n“So, tell me about the plantation skaa. What are they like?”\nVin shrugged. “Like skaa everywhere else.”\n“Are they intelligent?”\n“Some are.”\n“But, not like you and me, right?” Elend asked.\nVin paused. How would a noblewoman respond? “No, of course not.\nThey’re just skaa. Why are you so interested in them?”\nElend seemed . . . disappointed. “No reason,” he said, sitting back in his\nchair and opening his book. “I think some of those men over there want to\nask you to dance.”\nVin turned, noticing that there was indeed a group of young men standing\na short distance from her table.

Lord Venture’s presence intimidates them, I think.”\nElend snorted. “They should know that I am anything but intimidating.”\nVin frowned, but Elend just continued to read. Fine! she thought, turning\nback toward the young men. She caught one man’s eye, smiling slightly.\nA few moments later, the young man approached. He spoke to her in a\nstiff, formal tone. “Lady Renoux, I am Lord Melend Liese. Would you care\nto dance?”\nVin shot a glance at Elend, but he didn’t look up from his book.\n“I would love to, Lord Liese,” Vin said, taking the young man’s hand and\nrising.\nHe led her down to the dance floor, and as they approached, Vin’s\nnervousness returned. Suddenly, one week of practice didn’t seem like\nenough. The music stopped, allowing for couples to leave or enter the floor,\nand Lord Liese led her forward.\nVin fought down her paranoia, reminding herself that everyone saw the\ndress and the rank, not Vin herself. She looked up into Lord Liese’s eyes\nand saw, surprisingly, apprehension.\nThe music began, as did the dancing. Lord Liese’s face took on a look of\nconsternation. She could feel his palm sweating in her hands. Why, he’s just\nas nervous as I am! Perhaps even more.\nLiese was younger than Elend, closer to her own age. He probably wasn’t\nvery experienced with balls—he certainly didn’t look like he’d danced\nmuch. He focused so much on the steps that his motions felt rigid.\nIt makes sense, Vin realized, relaxing and letting her body move in the\nmotions Sazed had taught. The experienced ones wouldn’t ask me to dance,\nnot when I’m so new. I’m beneath their notice.\nBut, why is Elend paying attention to me? Is it simply what Sazed said—a\nploy to annoy his father? Why, then, does he seem interested in what I have\nto say?\n“Lord Liese,” Vin said. “Do you know much of Elend Venture?”\nLiese looked up. “Um, I . . .”\n“Don’t focus so much on the dancing,” Vin said. “My instructor says that\nit will flow more naturally if you don’t try too hard.”\nHe blushed.\nLord Ruler! Vin thought. How fresh is this boy?\n“Um, Lord Venture . . .” Liese said. “I don’t know. He’s a very important\nperson. Far more important than I am.”\n“Don’t let his lineage intimidate you,” Vin said. “From what I’ve seen,\nhe’s pretty harmless.”\n“I don’t know, my lady,” Liese said. “Venture is a very influential house.”\n“Yes, well, Elend doesn’t live up to that reputation.

She couldn’t very well\nexplain that to Liese, however.\nBut, maybe . . . Didn’t Renoux say that he’d met Elend once?\n“Oh, Elend is a friend of the family,” Vin said as they spun beneath a\ncrystalline skylight.\n“He is?”\n“Yes,” Vin said. “It was very kind of my uncle to ask Elend to watch over\nme at these parties, and so far he’s been quite a dear. I do wish that he’d pay\nless attention to those books of his and more attention to introducing me,\nthough.”\nLiese perked up, and he seemed to grow a little less insecure. “Oh. Why,\nthat makes sense.”\n“Yes,” Vin said, “Elend has been like an older brother to me during my\ntime here in Luthadel.”\nLiese smiled.\n“I ask you about him because he doesn’t speak much of himself,” Vin\nsaid.\n“The Ventures have all been quiet lately,” Liese said. “Ever since the\nattack on their keep several months back.”\nVin nodded. “You know much about that?”\nLiese shook his head. “No one tells me anything.” He glanced down,\nwatching their feet. “You’re very good at dancing, Lady Renoux. You must\nhave attended many balls back in your home city.”\n“You flatter me, my lord,” Vin said.\n“No, really. You’re so . . . graceful.”\nVin smiled, feeling a slight surge of confidence.\n“Yes,” Liese said, almost to himself. “You’re not at all like Lady Shan\nsaid—” He stopped, jerking slightly, as if realizing what he was saying.\n“What?” Vin said.\n“Nothing,” Liese said, his blush rising. “I’m sorry. It was nothing.”\nLady Shan, Vin thought. Remember that name.\nShe prodded Liese further as the dance progressed, but he was obviously\ntoo inexperienced to know much. He did feel that there was a tension rising\nbetween the houses; though the balls continued, there were more and more\nabsences as people didn’t attend parties thrown by their political rivals.\nWhen the dance ended, Vin felt good about her efforts. She probably\nhadn’t discovered much of value to Kelsier—however, Liese was only the\nbeginning. She’d work up to more important people.\nWhich means, Vin thought as Liese led her back to her table, I’m going to\nhave to attend a lot more of these balls. It wasn’t that the balls themselves\nwere unpleasant—especially now that she was more confident in her\ndancing. However, more balls meant fewer chances to be out in the mists.\nNot that Sazed would let me go anyway, she thought with an inward sigh,\nsmiling politely as Liese bowed and retreated.\nElend had spread his books across the table, and her alcove was lit by"

He didn’t look up as she sat. Sazed, she noticed, was nowhere to be\nseen.\n“I sent the Terrisman to dinner,” Elend said distractedly as he scribbled.\n“No need for him to go hungry while you twirled down below.”\nVin raised an eyebrow, regarding the books that dominated her tabletop.\nEven as she watched, Elend pushed one tome aside—leaving it open to a\nspecific page—and pulled over another. “So, how was the aforementioned\ntwirling, anyway?” he said.\n“It was actually kind of fun.”\n“I thought you weren’t very good at it.”\n“I wasn’t,” Vin said. “I practiced. You may find this information\nsurprising, but sitting in the back of a room reading books in the dark\ndoesn’t exactly help one become a better dancer.”\n“Is that a proposition?” Elend asked, pushing aside his book and\nselecting another. “It’s unladylike to ask a man to dance, you know.”\n“Oh, I wouldn’t want to take you away from your reading,” Vin said,\nturning a book toward her. She grimaced—the text was written in a small,\ncramped hand. “Besides, dancing with you would undermine all of the work\nI just did.”\nElend paused. Then he finally looked up. “Work?”\n“Yes,” Vin said. “Sazed was right—Lord Liese finds you intimidating,\nand he found me intimidating by association. It could be quite disastrous to\na young lady’s social life if all of the young men assumed her unavailable\nsimply because an annoying lord decided to study at her table.”\n“So . . .” Elend said.\n“So I told him that you were simply showing me the ways of court. Kind\nof like an . . . older brother.”\n“Older brother?” Elend asked, frowning.\n“Much older,” Vin said, smiling. “I mean, you’ve got to be at least twice\nmy age.”\n“Twice your . . . Valette, I’m twenty-one. Unless you’re a very mature\nten-year-old, I’m nowhere near ‘twice your age!’”\n“I’ve never been good with math,” Vin said offhandedly.\nElend sighed, rolling his eyes. Nearby, Lord Liese was speaking quietly\nwith his group of friends, gesturing toward Vin and Elend. Hopefully, one\nwould come ask her to dance soon.\n“Do you know a Lady Shan?” Vin asked idly as she waited.\nSurprisingly, Elend looked up. “Shan Elariel?”\n“I assume so,” Vin said. “Who is she?”\nElend turned back to his book. “Nobody important.”\nVin raised an eyebrow. “Elend, I’ve only been doing this for a few\nmonths, but even I know not to trust a comment like that.”\n“Well . . .” Elend said. “I might be engaged to her.”"

        "text": "months, but even I know not to trust a comment like that.”\n“Well . . .” Elend said. “I might be engaged to her.”\n“You have a fiancée?” Vin asked with exasperation.\n“I’m not exactly sure. We haven’t really done anything about the\nsituation for a year or so. Everyone’s likely forgotten the matter by now.”\nGreat, Vin thought.\nA moment later, one of Liese’s friends approached. Glad to be rid of the\nfrustrating Venture heir, Vin stood, accepting the young lord’s hand. As she\nwalked to the dance floor, she glanced at Elend, and caught him peeking\nover the book at her. He immediately turned back to his research with an\novertly indifferent air.\nVin sat down at her table, feeling a remarkable level of exhaustion. She\nresisted the urge to pull off her shoes and massage her feet; she suspected\nthat wouldn’t be very ladylike. She quietly turned on her copper, then\nburned pewter, strengthening her body and washing away a bit of her\nfatigue.\nShe let her pewter, then her copper, lapse. Kelsier had assured her that\nwith copper on, she couldn’t be spotted as an Allomancer. Vin wasn’t so\ncertain. With pewter burning, her reactions were too fast, her body too\nstrong. It seemed to her that an observant person would be able to notice\nsuch inconsistencies, whether or not they themselves were an Allomancer.\nWith the pewter off, her fatigue returned. She’d been trying to wean\nherself off constant pewter lately. Her wound was to the point that it only\nhurt badly if she twisted the wrong way, and she wanted to recover her\nstrength on her own, if she could.\nIn a way, her fatigue this evening was a good thing—it was a result of an\nextended period of dancing. Now that the young men regarded Elend as a\nguardian, rather than a romantic interest, they had no qualms about asking\nVin to dance. And, worried that she would make an unintended political\nstatement by refusing, Vin had agreed to each request. A few months ago,\nshe would have laughed at the idea of exhaustion from dancing. However,\nher sore feet, aching side, and tired legs were only part of it. The effort of\nmemorizing names and houses—not to mention putting up with her dancing\npartners’ fluffy conversation—left her mentally drained.\nIt’s a good thing Sazed had me wear slippers instead of heels, Vin\nthought with a sigh, sipping her chilled juice. The Terrisman hadn’t returned\nfrom his dinner yet. Notably, Elend wasn’t at the table either—though his\nbooks still lay scattered across its top.\nVin eyed the tomes. Perhaps if she appeared to be reading, the young\nmen would leave her alone for a bit. She reached over, riffling through the\nbooks for a likely candidate. The one she was most interested in—Elend’s\nsmall, leather-bound notebook—was missing.\nInstead, she picked a large, blue tome and hefted it over to her side of the\ntable. She had picked it for its large lettering—was paper really so\nexpensive that scribes needed to cram as many lines to a page as possible?\nVin sighed, leafing through the volume.\nI can’t believe people read books this big, she thought.

Despite the large\nlettering, each page was filled with words. It would take days and days to\nread the entire thing. Reen had taught her reading so that she would be able\nto decipher contracts, write notes, and perhaps play a noblewoman.\nHowever, her training hadn’t extended to texts this massive.\nHistorical Practices in Imperial Political Rule, the first page read. The\nchapters had titles like “The Fifth Century Governorship Program” and\n“The Rise of Skaa Plantations.” She flipped through to the end of the book,\nfiguring it would probably be the most interesting. The final chapter was\ntitled “Current Political Structure.”\nSo far, she read, the plantation system has produced a far more stable\ngovernment than previous methodologies. The structure of Dominances\nwith each provincial lord taking command of—and responsibility for—his\nskaa has fostered a competitive environment where discipline is harshly\nenforced.\nThe Lord Ruler apparently finds this system troubling because of the\nfreedom it allows the aristocracy. However, the relative lack of organized\nrebellion is undoubtedly enticing; during the two hundred years that the\nsystem has been in place, there hasn’t been a major uprising in the Five\nInner Dominances.\nOf course, this political system is only an extension of the greater\ntheocratic rulership. The aristocracy’s independence has been tempered by\na renewed vigor in obligator enforcement. No lord, no matter how lofty,\nwould be advised to think himself above their law. The call from an\nInquisitor can come to anyone.\nVin frowned. While the text itself was dry, she was surprised that the\nLord Ruler allowed such analytical discussions of his empire. She settled\nback in her chair, holding up the book, but she didn’t read any more. She\nwas too exhausted from the hours she had spent covertly trying to wiggle\ninformation out of her dancing partners.\nUnfortunately, politics didn’t pay heed to Vin’s state of exhaustion.\nThough she did her best to appear absorbed in Elend’s book, a figure soon\napproached her table.\nVin sighed, preparing herself for another dance. She soon realized,\nhowever, that the newcomer wasn’t a nobleman, but a Terrisman steward.\nLike Sazed, he wore robes with overlapping V designs, and was very fond\nof jewelry.\n“Lady Valette Renoux?” the tall man asked in a faintly accented voice.\n“Yes,” Vin said hesitantly.\n“My mistress, Lady Shan Elariel, requires your presence at her table.”\nRequires? Vin thought. She already didn’t like that tone, and she had\nlittle desire to meet with Elend’s former betrothed. Unfortunately, House\nElariel was one of the more powerful Great Houses—probably not someone\nto dismiss offhandedly.\nThe Terrisman waited expectantly.\n“Very well,” Vin said, rising with as much grace as she could muster.\nThe Terrisman led Vin toward a table a short distance from her own. The\ntable was well attended, with five women seated around it, and Vin picked\nout Shan immediately. Lady Elariel was obviously the statuesque woman\nwith long dark hair.

Her arms sparkled with lavender\nbracelets that matched her dress, and she turned dismissive eyes toward Vin\nas she approached.\nThose dark eyes, however, were keen. Vin felt exposed before them—\nstripped of her fine dress, reduced to a dirty urchin once again.\n“Excuse us, ladies,” Shan said. The women immediately did as ordered,\ndeparting the table in a stately flurry.\nShan picked up a fork and began to meticulously dissect and devour a\nsmall piece of dessert cake. Vin stood uncertainly, the Terrisman steward\ntaking up a position behind Shan’s chair.\n“You may sit,” Shan said.\nI feel like a skaa again, Vin thought, sitting. Noblemen treat each other\nthis way too?\n“You are in an enviable position, child,” Shan said.\n“How is that?” Vin asked.\n“Address me as ‘Lady Shan,’ ” Shan said, her tone unchanged. “Or,\nperhaps, ‘Your Ladyship.’ ”\nShan waited expectantly, taking petite bites of the cake. Finally, Vin said,\n“Why is that, Your Ladyship?”\n“Because young Lord Venture has decided to use you in his games. That\nmeans you have the opportunity to be used by me as well.”\nVin frowned. Remember to stay in character. You’re the easily\nintimidated Valette.\n“Wouldn’t it be better to not be used at all, Your Ladyship?” Vin said\ncarefully.\n“Nonsense,” Shan replied. “Even an uncultured simpleton like yourself\nmust see the importance of being useful to your betters.” Shan said the\nwords, even the insult, without vehemence; she simply seemed to take it for\ngranted that Vin would agree.\nVin sat, dumbfounded. None of the other nobility had treated her in such\na manner. Of course, the only member of a Great House she’d met so far\nwas Elend.\n“I trust from your vapid look that you accept your place,” Shan said. “Do\nwell, child, and perhaps I will let you join my retinue. You could learn\nmuch from the ladies here in Luthadel.”\n“Such as?” Vin asked, trying to keep the snappishness out of her voice.\n“Look at yourself sometime, child. Hair like you’ve undergone some\nterrible disease, so scrawny that your dress hangs like a bag. Being a\nnoblewoman in Luthadel requires . . . perfection. Not that.” She said the last\nword while waving her hand dismissively toward Vin.\nVin flushed. There was a strange power to this woman’s demeaning\nattitude. With a start, Vin realized that Shan reminded her of some\ncrewleaders she had known, Camon the latest of them—men who would hit\na person, fully expecting no resistance. Everyone knew that resisting such\nmen only made the beating worse.\n“What do you want from me?” Vin asked.\nShan raised an eyebrow as she set aside her fork, the cake only half-\neaten. The Terrisman took the plate and walked off with it. “You really are a\ndull-minded thing, aren’t you?” Shan asked.\nVin paused. “What does Her Ladyship want from me?”"

The Terrisman took the plate and walked off with it. “You really are a\ndull-minded thing, aren’t you?” Shan asked.\nVin paused. “What does Her Ladyship want from me?”\n“I’ll tell you eventually—assuming Lord Venture decides to keep playing\nwith you.” Vin caught just the barest flash of hatred in her eyes when she\nsaid Elend’s name.\n“For now,” Shan continued, “tell me of your conversation with him this\nevening.”\nVin opened her mouth to respond. But . . . something felt wrong. She\nonly caught the barest flicker of it—she wouldn’t have even noticed that\nmuch without Breeze’s training.\nA Soother? Interesting.\nShan was trying to make Vin complacent. So that she would talk,\nperhaps? Vin began to relate her conversation with Elend, staying away\nfrom anything interesting. However, something still felt odd to her—\nsomething about the way that Shan was playing with her emotions. From\nthe corner of her eye, Vin saw Shan’s Terrisman return from the kitchens.\nHowever, he didn’t walk back toward Shan’s table—he headed in the other\ndirection.\nToward Vin’s own table. He paused beside it, and began to poke through\nElend’s books.\nWhatever he wants, I can’t let him find it.\nVin stood suddenly, finally provoking an overt reaction in Shan as the\nwoman looked up with surprise.\n“I just remembered that I told my Terrisman to find me at my table!” Vin\nsaid. “He’ll be worried if I’m not sitting there!”\n“Oh, for the Lord Ruler’s sake,” Shan muttered under her breath. “Child,\nthere is no need—”\n“I’m sorry, Your Ladyship,” Vin said. “I’ve got to go.”\nIt was a bit obvious, but it was the best she could manage. Vin curtsied\nand withdrew from Shan’s table, leaving the displeased woman behind. The\nTerrisman was good—by the time Vin was a few steps away from Shan’s\ntable, he had noticed Vin and continued on his way, his motions\nimpressively smooth.\nVin arrived back at her table, wondering if she’d made a blunder by\nleaving Shan so rudely. However, she was growing too tired to care. As she\nnoticed another group of young men eyeing her, she hurriedly sat, plopping\nopen one of Elend’s books.\nFortunately, the ploy worked better this time. The young men eventually\ntrailed away, leaving Vin in peace, and she sat back, relaxing slightly with\nthe book open before her. The evening was growing late, and the ballroom\nwas slowly beginning to empty.\nThe books, she thought with a frown, picking up her cup of juice to take a\nsip. What did the Terrisman want with them?\nShe scanned the table, trying to notice if anything had been disturbed, but\nElend had left the books in such a state of disarray that it was hard to tell.\nHowever, a small book sitting beneath another tome caught her eye. Most\nof the other texts lay open to a specific page, and she had seen Elend\nperusing them. This particular book, however, was closed—and she\ncouldn’t remember him ever opening it. It had been there before—she\nrecognized it because it was so much thinner than the others—so the\nTerrisman hadn’t left it behind."

It had been there before—she\nrecognized it because it was so much thinner than the others—so the\nTerrisman hadn’t left it behind.\nCurious, Vin reached over and slid the book out from underneath the\nlarger book. It had had a black leather cover, and the spine read Weather\nPatterns of the Northern Dominance. Vin frowned, turning the book over in\nher hands. There was no title page, nor was an author listed. It launched\ndirectly into text.\nWhen regarding the Final Empire in its entirety, one certain fact is unmistakable. For a nation ruled by a self-proclaimed divinity, the empire has experienced a frightening\nnumber of colossal leadership errors. Most of these have been successfully covered up, and can only be found in the metalminds of Feruchemists or on the pages of\nbanned texts. However, one only need look to the near past to note such blunders as the Massacre at Devanex, the revision of the Deepness Doctrine, and the relocation of\nthe Renates peoples.\nThe Lord Ruler does not age. That much, at least, is undeniable. This text, however, purports to prove that he is by no means infallible. During the days before the\nAscension, mankind suffered chaos and uncertainty caused by an endless cycle of kings, emperors, and other monarchs. One would think that now, with a single, immortal\ngovernor, society would finally have an opportunity to find stability and enlightenment. It is the remarkable lack of either attribute in the Final Empire that is the Lord\nRuler’s most grievous oversight.\nVin stared at the page. Some of the words were beyond her skill, but she\nwas able to grasp the author’s meaning. He was saying . . .\nShe snapped the book closed and hurriedly put it back in its place. What\nwould happen if the obligators discovered that Elend owned such a text?\nShe glanced to the sides. They were there, of course, mingling with the\ncrowds like at the other ball, marked by their gray robes and tattooed faces.\nMany sat at tables with noblemen. Friends? Or spies for the Lord Ruler?\nNobody seemed quite as comfortable when an obligator was nearby.\nWhat is Elend doing with a book like that? A powerful nobleman like\nhimself? Why would he read texts that malign the Lord Ruler?\nA hand fell on her shoulder, and Vin spun reflexively, pewter and copper\nflaring in her stomach.\n“Whoa,” Elend said, stepping back and raising his hand. “Has anyone\never told you how jumpy you are, Valette?”\nVin relaxed, sitting back in her chair and extinguishing her metals. Elend\nsauntered over to his place and sat down. “Enjoying Heberen?”\nVin frowned, and Elend nodded to the larger, thick book that still sat\nbefore her.\n“No,” Vin said. “It’s boring. I was just pretending to read so that the men\nwould leave me alone for a bit.”\nElend chuckled. “Now, see, your cleverness is coming back to snap at\nyou.”\nVin raised an eyebrow as Elend began to gather up his books, stacking\nthem on the table. He didn’t appear to notice that she’d moved the\n“weather” book, but he did carefully slide it into the middle of the stack."

I probably shouldn’t tell him about\nShan—not until I talk to Sazed. “I think my cleverness did its job well,” she\nsaid instead. “After all, I came to the ball to dance.”\n“I find dancing overrated.”\n“You can’t remain aloof from the court forever, Lord Venture—you’re\nthe heir of a very important house.”\nHe sighed, stretching and leaning back in his chair. “I suppose you’re\nright,” he said with surprising frankness. “But the longer I hold out, the\nmore annoyed my father will become. That, in itself, is a worthy goal.”\n“He’s not the only one you hurt,” Vin said. “What of the girls that never\nget asked to dance because you’re too busy rummaging through your\nbooks?”\n“As I recall,” Elend said, setting the last book on the top of his pile,\n“someone was just pretending to read in order to avoid dancing. I don’t\nthink the ladies have any trouble finding more amicable partners than\nmyself.”\nVin raised an eyebrow. “I didn’t have trouble because I’m new and I’m\nlow-ranked. I suspect that the ladies closer to your station have trouble\nfinding partners, amicable or not. As I understand it, noblemen are\nuncomfortable dancing with women above their station.”\nElend paused, obviously searching for a comeback.\nVin leaned forward. “What is it, Elend Venture? Why are you so intent on\navoiding your duty?”\n“Duty?” Elend asked, leaning toward her, his posture earnest. “Valette,\nthis isn’t duty. This ball . . . this is fluff and distraction. A waste of time.”\n“And women?” Vin asked. “Are they a waste too?”\n“Women?” Elend asked. “Women are like . . . thunderstorms. They’re\nbeautiful to look at, and sometimes they’re nice to listen to—but most of\nthe time they’re just plain inconvenient.”\nVin felt her jaw drop slightly. Then she noticed the twinkle in his eye, the\nsmile at the edges of his lips, and she found herself smiling as well. “You\nsay these things just to provoke me!”\nHis smile deepened. “I’m charming that way.” He stood, looking at her\nfondly. “Ah, Valette. Don’t let them trick you into taking yourself too\nseriously. It’s not worth the effort. But, I must bid you a good evening. Try\nnot to let months pass between balls you attend in the future.”\nVin smiled. “I’ll think about it.”\n“Please do,” Elend said, bending down and scooting the tall stack of\nbooks off the table and into his arms. He teetered for a moment, then\nsteadied himself and peeked to the side. “Who knows—maybe one of these\ndays you’ll actually get me to dance.”\nVin smiled, nodding as the nobleman turned and walked off, circling the\nperimeter of the ballroom’s second tier.

The three began to\nwalk together, chatting.\nVin didn’t recognize the newcomers. She sat thoughtfully as Sazed\nfinally appeared out of a side hallway, and Vin eagerly waved him forward.\nHe approached with a hurried step.\n“Who are those men with Lord Venture?” Vin asked, pointing toward\nElend.\nSazed squinted behind his spectacles. “Why . . . one of them is Lord\nJastes Lekal. The other is a Hasting, though I don’t know his given name.”\n“You sound surprised.”\n“Houses Lekal and Hasting are both political rivals of House Venture,\nMistress. Noblemen often visit with each other in smaller, after-ball parties,\nmaking alliances. . . .” The Terrisman paused, turning back to her. “Master\nKelsier will wish to hear of this, I think. It is time we retire.”\n“I agree,” Vin said, rising. “And so do my feet. Let’s go.”\nSazed nodded, and the two of them made their way to the front doors.\n“What took you so long?” Vin asked as they waited for an attendant to fetch\nher shawl.\n“I came back several times, Mistress,” Sazed said. “But you were always\ndancing. I decided I would be of far more use speaking with the servants\nthan I would be standing beside your table.”\nVin nodded, accepting her shawl, then walked out the front steps and\ndown the carpeted stairs, Sazed just behind her. Her step was quick—she\nwanted to get back and tell Kelsier the names she’d memorized before she\nforgot the whole list. She paused at the landing, waiting for a servant to\nfetch her carriage. As she did, she noticed something odd. A small\ndisturbance was going on a short distance away in the mists. She stepped\nforward, but Sazed put a hand on her shoulder, holding her back. A lady\nwouldn’t wander off into the mists.\nShe reached to burn copper and tin, but waited—the disturbance was\ngetting closer. It resolved as a guard appeared from the mists, pulling a\nsmall, struggling form: a skaa boy in dirty clothing, face soot-stained. The\nsoldier gave Vin a wide berth, nodding apologetically to her as he\napproached one of the guard captains. Vin burned tin to hear what was said.\n“Kitchen boy,” the soldier said quietly. “Tried to beg from one of the\nnoblemen inside a carriage when they stopped for the gates to open.”\nThe captain simply nodded. The soldier pulled his captive back out into\nthe mists, walking toward the far courtyard. The boy struggled, and the\nsoldier grunted with annoyance, keeping a tight grip. Vin watched him go,\nSazed’s hand on her shoulder, as if to hold her back. Of course she couldn’t\nhelp the boy. He shouldn’t have—\nIn the mists, beyond the eyesight of regular people, the soldier drew out a\ndagger and slit the boy’s throat. Vin jumped, shocked, as the sounds of the\nboy’s struggling tapered off. The guard dropped the body, then grabbed it\nby a leg and began to drag it away.\nVin stood, stunned, as her carriage pulled up."

It\nseemed such an impossible contrast to her. The pleasant nobility, dancing,\njust inside a room sparkling with light and dresses. Death in the courtyard.\nDidn’t they care?

The man in the\ndistance burned tin, as did the four others Kelsier had sensed hiding around\nKeep Tekiel. The five Tineyes formed a perimeter, watching the night,\nsearching for intruders.\nKelsier smiled. The Great Houses were growing nervous. Keeping five\nTineyes on watch wouldn’t be that hard for a house like Tekiel, but the\nnoblemen Allomancers would resent being forced into simple guard duty.\nAnd if there were five Tineyes on watch, chances were good that a number\nof Thugs, Coinshots, and Lurchers were on call as well. Luthadel was\nquietly in a state of alert.\nThe Great Houses were growing so wary, in fact, that Kelsier had trouble\nfinding cracks in their defenses. He was only one man, and even Mistborn\nhad limits. His success so far had been achieved through surprise. However,\nwith five Tineyes on watch, Kelsier wouldn’t be able to get very close to the\nkeep without serious risk of being spotted.\nFortunately, Kelsier didn’t need to test Tekiel’s defenses this night.\nInstead, he crept along the wall toward the outer grounds. He paused near\nthe garden well, and—burning bronze to make certain no Allomancers were\nnear—reached into a stand of bushes to retrieve a large sack. It was heavy\nenough that he had to burn pewter to pull it free and throw it over his\nshoulder. He paused in the night for a moment, straining for sounds in the\nmist, then hauled the sack back toward the keep.\nHe stopped near a large, whitewashed garden veranda that sat beside a\nsmall reflecting pool. Then, he heaved the sack off his shoulder and dumped\nits contents—a freshly killed corpse—onto the ground.\nThe body—which had belonged to one Lord Charrs Entrone—rolled to a\nstop with its face in the dirt, twin dagger wounds glistening in its back.\nKelsier had ambushed the half-drunken man on a street just outside of a\nskaa slum, ridding the world of another nobleman. Lord Entrone, in\nparticular, would not be missed—he was infamous for his twisted sense of\npleasure. Skaa bloodfights, for instance, were a particular enjoyment of his.\nThat was where he had spent this evening.\nEntrone had, not coincidentally, been a major political ally of House\nTekiel. Kelsier left the corpse sitting in its own blood. The gardeners would\nlocate it first—and once the servants knew about the death, no amount of\nnoble obstinacy would keep it quiet. The murder would cause an outcry, and\nimmediate blame would probably be placed upon House Izenry, House\nTekiel’s rival. However, Entrone’s suspiciously unexpected death might\nmake House Tekiel wary. If they began poking around, they would find that\nEntrone’s gambling opponent at the night’s bloodfight had been Crews\nGeffenry—a man whose house had been petitioning the Tekiels for a\nstronger alliance. Crews was a known Mistborn, and a very competent\nknife-fighter.\nAnd so, the intrigue would begin. Had House Izenry done the murder?"

Had House Izenry done the murder?\nOr, perhaps, had the death been an attempt by House Geffenry to push\nTekiel into a higher state of alarm—thereby encouraging them to seek allies\namong the lesser nobility? Or, was there a third answer—a house that\nwanted to strengthen the rivalry between Tekiel and Izenry?\nKelsier hopped off the garden wall, scratching at the fake beard he wore.\nIt didn’t really matter whom House Tekiel decided to blame; Kelsier’s real\npurpose was to make them question and worry, to make them mistrust and\nmisunderstand. Chaos was his strongest ally in fostering a house war. When\nthat war finally came, each noblemen killed would be one less person that\nthe skaa would have to face in their rebellion.\nAs soon as Kelsier got a short distance from Keep Tekiel, he flipped a\ncoin and went to the rooftops. Occasionally, he wondered what the people\nin the houses beneath him thought, hearing footsteps from above. Did they\nknow that Mistborn found their homes a convenient highway, a place where\nthey could move without being bothered by guards or thieves? Or, did the\npeople attribute the knockings to the ever-blamable mistwraiths?\nThey probably don’t even notice. Sane people are asleep when the mists\ncome out. He landed on a peaked roof, retrieved his pocket watch from a\nnook to check the time, then stowed it—and the dangerous metal from\nwhich it was made—away again. Many nobility blatantly wore metal, a\nfoolish form of bravado. The habit had been inherited directly from the\nLord Ruler. Kelsier, however, didn’t like carrying any metal—watch, ring,\nor bracelet—on him that he didn’t have to.\nHe launched himself into the air again, making his way toward the\nSootwarrens, a skaa slum on the far northern side of town. Luthadel was an\nenormous, sprawling city; every few decades or so, new sections were\nadded, the city wall expanded through the sweat and effort of skaa labor.\nWith the advent of the modern canal era, stone was growing relatively\ncheap and easy to move.\nI wonder why he even bothers with the wall, Kelsier thought, moving\nalong rooftops parallel to the massive structure. Who would attack? The\nLord Ruler controls everything. Not even the western isles resist anymore.\nThere hadn’t been a true war in the Final Empire for centuries. The\noccasional “rebellion” consisted of nothing more than a few thousand men\nhiding in hills or caves, coming out for periodic raids. Even Yeden’s\nrebellion wouldn’t rely much on force—they were counting on the chaos of\na house war, mixed with the strategic misdirection of the Luthadel Garrison,\nto give them an opening. If it came down to an extended campaign, Kelsier\nwould lose. The Lord Ruler and the Steel Ministry could marshal literally\nmillions of troops if the need arose.\nOf course, there was his other plan. Kelsier didn’t speak of it, he barely\neven dared consider it. He probably wouldn’t even have an opportunity to\nimplement it. But, if the opportunity did arrive . . ."

But, if the opportunity did arrive . . .\nHe dropped to the ground just outside of the Sootwarrens, then pulled his\nmistcloak tight and walked along the street with a confident step. His\ncontact sat in the doorway of a closed shop, puffing quietly on a pipe.\nKelsier raised an eyebrow; tobacco was an expensive luxury. Hoid was\neither very wasteful, or he was just as successful as Dockson implied.\nHoid calmly put away the pipe, then climbed to his feet—though that\ndidn’t make him much taller. The scrawny bald man bowed deeply in the\nmisty night. “Greetings, my lord.”\nKelsier paused in front of the man, arms tucked carefully inside his\nmistcloak. It wouldn’t do for a street informant to realize that the\nunidentified “nobleman” he was meeting with had the scars of Hathsin on\nhis arms.\n“You come highly recommended,” Kelsier said, mimicking the haughty\naccent of a nobleman.\n“I am one of the best, my lord.”\nAnyone who can survive as long as you have must be good, Kelsier\nthought. Lords didn’t like the idea of other men knowing their secrets.\nInformants generally didn’t live very long.\n“I need to know something, informant,” Kelsier said. “But first you must\nvow never to speak of this meeting to anyone.”\n“Of course, my lord,” Hoid said. He’d likely break the promise before the\nnight was out—another reason informants didn’t tend to live very long.\n“There is, however, the matter of payment. . . .”\n“You’ll have your money, skaa,” Kelsier snapped.\n“Of course, my lord,” Hoid said with a quick bob of the head. “You\nrequested information regarding House Renoux, I believe. . . .”\n“Yes. What is known about it? Which houses is it aligned with? I must\nknow these things.”\n“There isn’t really much to know, my lord,” Hoid said. “Lord Renoux is\nvery new to the area, and he is a careful man. He’s making neither allies nor\nenemies at the moment—he’s buying a large number of weapons and armor,\nbut is probably just purchasing from a wide variety of houses and\nmerchants, thereby ingratiating himself to them all. A wise tactic. He will,\nperhaps, have an excess of merchandise, but he will also have an excess of\nfriends, yes?”\nKelsier snorted. “I don’t see why I should pay you for that.”\n“He’ll have too much merchandise, my lord,” Hoid said quickly. “You\ncould make a clever profit, knowing that Renoux is shipping at a loss.”\n“I’m no merchant, skaa,” Kelsier said. “I don’t care about profits and\nshipping!” Let him chew on that. Now he thinks I’m of a Great House—of\ncourse, if he hadn’t suspected that because of the mistcloak, then he doesn’t\ndeserve his reputation.\n“Of course, my lord,” Hoid said quickly. “There is more, of course. . . .”\nAh, and here we see it.

Does the street know that House Renoux is\nconnected to the rumblings of rebellion? If anyone had discovered that\nsecret, then Kelsier’s crew was in serious jeopardy.\nHoid coughed quietly, holding out his hand.\n“Insufferable man!” Kelsier snapped, tossing a pouch at Hoid’s feet.\n“Yes, my lord,” Hoid said, falling to his knees and searching about with\nhis hand. “I apologize, my lord. My eyesight is weak, you know. I can\nbarely see my own fingers held in front of my face.”\nClever, Kelsier thought as Hoid found the pouch and tucked it away. The\ncomment about eyesight was, of course, a lie—no man would get far in the\nunderground with such an impediment. However, a nobleman who thought\nhis informant to be half blind would be far less paranoid about being\nidentified. Not that Kelsier himself was worried—he wore one of Dockson’s\nbest disguises. Beside the beard, he had a fake, but realistic, nose, along\nwith platforms in the shoes and makeup to lighten his skin.\n“You said there was more?” Kelsier said. “I swear, skaa, if it isn’t good . .\n.”\n“It is,” Hoid said quickly. “Lord Renoux is considering a union between\nhis niece, the Lady Valette, and Lord Elend Venture.”\nKelsier paused. Wasn’t expecting that . . . “That’s silly. Venture is far\nabove Renoux.”\n“The two youths were seen speaking—at length—at the Venture ball a\nmonth ago.”\nKelsier laughed derisively. “Everyone knows about that. It meant\nnothing.”\n“Did it?” Hoid asked. “Does everyone know that Lord Elend Venture\nspoke very highly of the girl to his friends, the group of nobleling\nphilosophers that lounge at the Broken Quill?”\n“Young men speak of girls,” Kelsier said. “It means nothing. You will be\nreturning those coins.”\n“Wait!” Hoid said, sounding apprehensive for the first time. “There is\nmore. Lord Renoux and Lord Venture have had secret dealings.”\nWhat?\n“It is true,” Hoid continued. “This is fresh news—I heard it barely an\nhour ago myself. There is a connection between Renoux and Venture. And,\nfor some reason, Lord Renoux was able to demand that Elend Venture be\nassigned to watch over Lady Valette at balls.” He lowered his voice. “It is\neven whispered that Lord Renoux has some kind of . . . leverage over\nHouse Venture.”\nWhat happened at that ball tonight? Kelsier thought. Out loud, however,\nhe said, “This all sounds very weak, skaa. You have nothing more than idle\nspeculations?”\n“Not about House Renoux, my lord,” Hoid said. “I tried, but your worry\nover this house is meaningless! You should pick a house more central to\npolitics. Like, say, House Elariel . . .”\nKelsier frowned. By mentioning Elariel, Hoid was implying that he had\nsome important tidbit that would be worth Kelsier’s payment. It seemed that"

It was time to move the discussion along\nto other houses, so that Hoid wouldn’t get suspicious of Kelsier’s interest in\nRenoux.\n“Very well,” Kelsier said. “But if this isn’t worth my time . . .”\n“It is, my lord. Lady Shan Elariel is a Soother.”\n“Proof?”\n“I felt her touch on my emotions, my lord,” Hoid said. “During a fire at\nKeep Elariel a week ago, she was there calming the emotions of the\nservants.”\nKelsier had started that fire. Unfortunately, it hadn’t spread beyond the\nguardhouses. “What else?”\n“House Elariel has recently given her leave to use her powers more at\ncourt functions,” Hoid said. “They fear a house war, and wish her to make\nwhatever allegiances possible. She always carries a thin envelope of shaved\nbrass in her right glove. Get a Seeker close to her at a ball, and you shall\nsee. My lord, I do not lie! My life as an informant depends solely upon my\nreputation. Shan Elariel is a Soother.”\nKelsier paused, as if musing. The information was useless to him, but his\ntrue purpose—finding out about House Renoux—had already been fulfilled.\nHoid had earned his coins, whether he realized it or not.\nKelsier smiled. Now to sow a little more chaos.\n“What of Shan’s covert relationship with Salmen Tekiel?” Kelsier said,\npicking the name of a likely young nobleman. “Do you think that she used\nher powers to gain his favor?”\n“Oh, most certainly, my lord,” Hoid said quickly. Kelsier could see the\nglimmer of excitement in his eyes; he assumed that Kelsier had given him a\nluscious bit of political gossip free of charge.\n“Perhaps she was the one who secured Elariel the deal with House\nHasting last week,” Kelsier said musingly. There had been no such deal.\n“Most likely, my lord.”\n“Very well, skaa,” Kelsier said. “You have earned your coins. Perhaps I\nshall call upon you another time.”\n“Thank you, my lord,” Hoid said, bowing very low.\nKelsier dropped a coin and launched himself into the air. As he landed on\na rooftop, he caught a glimpse of Hoid scuttling over to pluck the coin off\nthe ground. Hoid didn’t have any trouble locating it, despite his “weak\neyesight.” Kelsier smiled, then kept moving. Hoid hadn’t mentioned\nKelsier’s tardiness, but Kelsier’s next appointment would not be so\nforgiving.\nHe made his way eastward, toward Ahlstrom Square. He pulled off his\nmistcloak as he moved, then ripped off his vest, revealing the tattered shirt\nhidden beneath. He dropped to an alleyway, discarding cloak and vest, then\ngrabbed a double handful of ash from the corner. He rubbed the crusty, dark\nflakes on his arms, masking his scars, then ground them onto his face and\nfalse beard."

He rubbed the crusty, dark\nflakes on his arms, masking his scars, then ground them onto his face and\nfalse beard.\nThe man who stumbled out of the alleyway seconds later was very\ndifferent from the nobleman who had met with Hoid. The beard, once neat,\nnow jutted out in an unkempt frazzle. A few, select bits had been removed,\nmaking it look patchy and sickly. Kelsier stumbled, pretending to have a\nlame leg, and called out to a shadowed figure standing near the square’s\nquiet fountain.\n“My lord?” Kelsier asked in a raspy voice. “My lord, is that you?”\nLord Straff Venture, leader of House Venture, was a domineering man,\neven for a nobleman. Kelsier could make out a pair of guards standing at his\nside; the lord himself didn’t seem the least bit bothered by the mists—it was\nopenly known that he was a Tineye. Venture stepped forward firmly,\ndueling cane tapping the ground beside him.\n“You are late, skaa!” he snapped.\n“My lord, I . . . I . . . I was waiting in the alley, my lord, like we agreed!”\n“We agreed to no such thing!”\n“I’m sorry, my lord,” Kelsier said again, bowing—then stumbling\nbecause of his “lame” leg. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I was just in the alley. I\ndidn’t mean to make you wait.”\n“Couldn’t you see us, man?”\n“I’m sorry, my lord,” Kelsier said. “My eyesight . . . it isn’t very good,\nyou know. I can barely see my own hands in front of my face.” Thanks for\nthe tip, Hoid.\nVenture snorted, handing his dueling cane to a guard, then slapped\nKelsier smartly across the face.\nKelsier stumbled to the ground, holding his cheek. “I’m sorry, my lord,”\nhe mumbled again.\n“Next time you make me wait, it will be the cane,” Venture said curtly.\nWell, I know where to go next time I need a corpse to dump on someone’s\nlawn, Kelsier thought, stumbling to his feet.\n“Now,” Venture said. “Let us get down to business. What is this\nimportant news you promised to deliver?”\n“It’s about House Erikell, my lord,” Kelsier said. “I know Your Lordship\nhas had dealings with them in the past.”\n“And?”\n“Well, my lord, they are cheating you dearly. They have been selling their\nswords and canes to House Tekiel for half the price you’ve been paying!”\n“Proof?”\n“You need only look to Tekiel’s new armaments, my lord,” Kelsier said.\n“My word is true. I have nothing but my reputation! If I have not that, I\nhave not my life.”\nAnd he wasn’t lying. Or, at least, not completely. It would be useless of\nKelsier to spread information that Venture could corroborate or dismiss with\nease. Some of what he said was true—Tekiel was giving a slight advantage\nto Erikell.

And, if Venture came to Renoux for\nweapons instead of Erikell . . . well, that would just be a side benefit.\nStraff Venture snorted. His house was powerful—incredibly powerful—\nand relied on no specific industry or enterprise to fuel its wealth.

Tell me about the Survivor of Hathsin.”\nKelsier froze. “Excuse me, my lord?”\n“You want to get paid?” Venture asked. “Well, tell me about the Survivor.\nRumors say he’s returned to Luthadel.”\n“Rumors only, my lord,” Kelsier said quickly. “I have never met this\nSurvivor, but I doubt he is in Luthadel—if, indeed, he even lives.”\n“I’ve heard that he’s gathering a skaa rebellion.”\n“There are always fools whispering rebellion to the skaa, my lord,”\nKelsier said. “And there are always those who try to use the name of the\nSurvivor, but I do not believe that any man could have lived through the\nPits. I could seek more information on this, if you wish, but I worry you\nwill be disappointed in what I find. The Survivor is dead—the Lord Ruler . .\n. he does not allow such oversights.”\n“True,” Venture said contemplatively. “But the skaa seem convinced\nabout this rumor of an ‘Eleventh Metal.’ Have you heard of it, informant?”\n“Ah, yes,” Kelsier said, covering his shock. “A legend, my lord.”\n“One I’ve never heard of,” Venture said. “And I pay very close attention\nto such things. This is no ‘legend.’ Someone very clever is manipulating the\nskaa.”\n“An . . . interesting conclusion, my lord,” Kelsier said.\n“Indeed,” Venture said. “And, assuming the Survivor did die in the Pits,\nand if someone had gotten ahold of his corpse . . . his bones . . . there are\nways to imitate a man’s appearance. You know of what I speak?”\n“Yes, my lord,” Kelsier said.\n“Watch for this,” Venture said. “I don’t care about your gossip—bring me\nsomething about this man, or whatever he is, that leads the skaa. Then\nyou’ll get some coin of me.”\nVenture spun in the darkness, waving to his men and leaving a thoughtful\nKelsier behind.\nKelsier arrived at Mansion Renoux a short time later; the spikeway between\nFellise and Luthadel made for quick travel between the cities.

We’re pretty good at doing that.\nHe peered through the mists at the lantern-lit mansion, his recovered\nmistcloak flapping slightly in the calm wind. The empty carriage indicated\nthat Vin and Sazed had returned from House Elariel. Kelsier found them\ninside, waiting in the sitting room and speaking quietly with Lord Renoux.\n“That’s a new look for you,” Vin noted as Kelsier walked into the room.\nShe still wore her dress—a beautiful red gown—though she sat in an\nunladylike position, legs tucked beneath her.\nKelsier smiled to himself. A few weeks ago she would have changed out\nof that gown as soon as she got back. We’ll turn her into a lady yet. He\nfound a seat, picking at the fake, soot-stained beard. “You mean this? I hear\nbeards are going to make a return soon. I’m just trying to stay on the edge\nof fashionability.”\nVin snorted. “The edge of beggar fashion, maybe.”\n“How did the evening go, Kelsier?” Lord Renoux asked.\nKelsier shrugged. “Like most others. Fortunately, it appears that House\nRenoux remains free of suspicion—though I myself am something of a\nconcern to some of the nobility.”\n“You?” Renoux asked.\nKelsier nodded as a servant brought him a warm, damp cloth to clean his\nface and arms—though Kelsier wasn’t certain if the servants were worried\nabout his comfort or the ash he might get on the furniture. He wiped off his\narms, exposing the pale white scratch scars, then began to pick off the\nbeard.\n“It seems that the general skaa have gotten wind of the Eleventh Metal,”\nhe continued. “Some of the nobility have heard the building rumors, and the\nmore intelligent ones are growing worried.”\n“How does this affect us?” Renoux asked.\nKelsier shrugged. “We’ll spread opposite rumors to make the nobility\nfocus more on each other and less on me. Though, amusingly, Lord Venture\nencouraged me to search out information about myself. A man could get\nvery confused from this kind of playacting—I don’t know how you do it,\nRenoux.”\n“It is who I am,” the kandra said simply.\nKelsier shrugged again, turning to Vin and Sazed. “So, how did your\nevening go?”\n“Frustratingly,” Vin said with a surly tone.\n“Mistress Vin is a tad annoyed,” Sazed said. “On the way back from\nLuthadel, she told me the secrets she’d gathered while dancing.”\nKelsier chuckled. “Not much of interest?”\n“Sazed already knew it all!” Vin snapped. “I spent hours twirling and\ntwittering for those men, and it was all worthless!”\n“Hardly worthless, Vin,” Kelsier said, pulling off the last bit of false\nbeard. “You made some contacts, you were seen, and you practiced your\ntwittering.

She didn’t seem quite as opposed to the idea of\nregularly attending balls as she once had, however.\nSazed cleared his throat. “Master Kelsier, I feel that I must mention\nsomething.

That Renoux and Venture are friends?”\nVin paled slightly. “How do you know?”\n“I’m mysteriously powerful,” Kelsier said with a wave of his hand.\n“Anyway, everyone thinks that House Renoux and House Venture have had\nsecret business dealings.

Things can get out of hand quickly. However, this isn’t much of a\nproblem—though it does mean that you’re going to have to be very careful\nwhen dealing with House Venture, Lord Renoux. We’ll want to see what\nkind of reaction they have to Vin’s comments.”\nLord Renoux nodded. “Agreed.”\nKelsier yawned. “Now, if there isn’t anything else, playing both\nnobleman and beggar in one evening has made me dreadfully tired. . . .”\n“There is one other thing, Master Kelsier,” Sazed said. “At the end of the\nevening, Mistress Vin saw Lord Elend Venture leaving the ball with young\nlords of Houses Lekal and Hasting.”\nKelsier paused, frowning. “That’s an odd combination.”\n“So I thought,” Sazed said.\n“He’s probably just trying to annoy his father,” Kelsier said musingly.\n“Fraternizing with the enemy in public . . .”\n“Perhaps,” Sazed said. “But the three did seem to be good friends.”\nKelsier nodded, standing. “Investigate this further, Saze. There’s a chance\nthat Lord Venture and his son are playing us all for fools.”\n“Yes, Master Kelsier,” Sazed said.\nKelsier left the room, stretching and handing his mistcloak to a servant.\nAs he walked up the eastern stairway, he heard quick footsteps. He turned\nto find Vin scooting up behind him, shimmering red dress held up as she\nclimbed the steps.\n“Kelsier,” she said quietly. “There was something else. Something I’d\nlike to talk about.”\nKelsier raised an eyebrow. Something she doesn’t even want Sazed to\nhear? “My room,” he said, and she followed him up the stairs and into the\nchamber.\n“What is this about?” he asked as she shut the door behind her."

Though he didn’t blaspheme against Allomancy, the obligators\nmade an exception in his case and strung him up on a hook anyway.”\n“Well,” Vin said, “Elend has a copy. I think one of the other noblewomen\nwas trying to find the book. I saw one of her servants rifling through them.”\n“Which noblewoman?”\n“Shan Elariel.”\nKelsier nodded. “Former fiancée. She’s probably searching for something\nto blackmail the Venture boy with.”\n“I think she’s an Allomancer, Kelsier.”\nKelsier nodded distractedly, thinking about the information. “She’s a\nSoother. She probably had the right idea with those books—if the Venture\nheir is reading a book like False Dawn, not to mention foolish enough to\ncarry it around with him . . .”\n“Is it that dangerous?” Vin asked.\nKelsier shrugged. “Moderately. It’s an older book, and it didn’t actually\nencourage rebellion, so it might slide.”\nVin frowned. “The book sounded pretty critical of the Lord Ruler. He\nallows the nobility to read things like that?”\n“He doesn’t really ‘allow’ them to do such things,” Kelsier said. “More,\nhe sometimes ignores it when they do. Banning books is tricky business,\nVin—the more stink the Ministry makes about a text, the more attention it\nwill draw, and the more people will be tempted to read it. False Dawn is a\nstuffy volume, and by not forbidding it, the Ministry doomed it to\nobscurity.”\nVin nodded slowly.\n“Besides,” Kelsier said, “the Lord Ruler is far more lenient with the\nnobility than he is with skaa. He sees them as the children of his long-dead\nfriends and allies, the men who supposedly helped him defeat the Deepness."

He sees them as the children of his long-dead\nfriends and allies, the men who supposedly helped him defeat the Deepness.\nHe occasionally lets them get away with things like reading edgy texts or\nassassinating family members.”\n“So . . . the book is nothing to worry about?” Vin asked.\nKelsier shrugged. “I wouldn’t say that either. If young Elend has False\nDawn, he might also have other books that are explicitly forbidden. If\nobligators had proof of that, they’d hand young Elend over to the\nInquisitors—nobleman or not. The question is, how do we make certain that\nhappens? If the Venture heir were to be executed, it would certainly add to\nLuthadel’s political turmoil.”\nVin paled visibly.\nYes, Kelsier thought with an internal sigh. She’s definitely falling for him.\nI should have foreseen this. Sending a young, pretty girl into noble society?\nOne vulture or another was bound to latch on to her.\n“I didn’t tell you this so we could get him killed, Kelsier!” she said. “I\nthought, maybe . . . well, he’s reading forbidden books, and he seems like a\ngood man. Maybe we can use him as an ally or something.”\nOh, child, Kelsier thought. I hope he doesn’t hurt you too much when he\ndiscards you. You should know better than this.\n“Don’t count on it,” he said out loud. “Lord Elend might be reading a\nforbidden book, but that doesn’t make him our friend. There have always\nbeen noblemen like him—young philosophers and dreamers who think that\ntheir ideas are new. They like to drink with their friends and grumble about\nthe Lord Ruler; but, in their hearts, they’re still noblemen. They’ll never\noverthrow the establishment.”\n“But—”\n“No, Vin,” Kelsier said. “You have to trust me. Elend Venture doesn’t\ncare about us or the skaa. He’s a gentleman anarchist because it’s\nfashionable and exciting.”\n“He talked to me about the skaa,” Vin said. “He wanted to know if they\nwere intelligent, and if they acted like real people.”\n“And was his interest compassionate or intellectual?”\nShe paused.\n“See,” Kelsier said. “Vin, that man is not our ally—in fact, I distinctly\nrecall telling you to stay away from him. When you spend time with Elend\nVenture, you put the operation—and your fellow crewmembers—in\njeopardy. Understand?”\nVin looked down, nodding.\nKelsier sighed. Why do I suspect that staying away from him is the last\nthing she intends to do? Bloody hell—I don’t have time to deal with this\nright now.\n“Go get some sleep,” Kelsier said. “We can talk more about this later.”\nIt isn’t a shadow.\nThis dark thing that follows me, the thing that only I can see—It isn’t really a shadow. It’s blackish and translucent, but it doesn’t have a shadowlike solid outline. It’s\ninsubstantial—wispy and formless.

She’d made\nIN WAS GROWING VERY TIRED\nthe same trip at least a dozen times during the last few weeks—watching\nthe same brown hills, scraggly trees, and rug of weedy underbrush. She was\nbeginning to feel as if she could individually identify each and every bump\nin the road.\nShe attended numerous balls—but they were only the beginning.\nLuncheons, sitting parties, and other forms of daily entertainment were just\nas popular. Often, Vin traveled between the cities two or even three times a\nday. Apparently, young noblewomen didn’t have anything better to do than\nsit in carriages for six hours a day.\nVin sighed. In the near distance, a group of skaa trudged along the\ntowpath beside a canal, pulling a barge toward Luthadel. Her life could be\nmuch worse.\nStill, she felt frustration. It was still midday, but there weren’t any\nimportant events happening until the evening, so she had nowhere to go but\nback to Fellise. She kept thinking about how much faster she could make\nthe trip if she used the spikeway. She longed to leap through the mists\nagain, but Kelsier had been reluctant to continue her training. He allowed\nher out for a short time each night to maintain her skills, but she wasn’t\nallowed any extreme, exciting leaps. Just some basic moves—mostly\nPushing and Pulling small objects while standing on the ground.\nShe was beginning to grow frustrated with her continued weakness. It\nhad been over three months since her encounter with the Inquisitor; the\nworst of winter had passed without even a flake of snow. How long was it\ngoing to take her to recover?\nAt least I can still go to balls, she thought. Despite her annoyance at the\nconstant traveling, Vin was coming to enjoy her duties. Pretending to be a\nnoblewoman was actually far less tense than regular thieving work. True,\nher life would be forfeit if her secret were ever discovered, but for now the\nnobility seemed willing to accept her—to dance with her, dine with her, and\nchat with her. It was a good life—a bit unexciting, but her eventual return to\nAllomancy would fix that.\nThat left her with two frustrations. The first was her inability to gather\nuseful information; she was getting increasingly annoyed at having her\nquestions avoided. She was growing experienced enough to tell that there\nwas a great deal of intrigue going on, yet she was still too new to be\nallowed a part in it.\nStill, while her outsider status was annoying, Kelsier was confident that it\nwould eventually change. Vin’s second major annoyance wasn’t so easily\ndealt with. Lord Elend Venture had been notably absent from several balls\nduring the last few weeks, and he had yet to repeat his act of spending the\nentire evening with her. While she rarely had to sit alone anymore, she was\nquickly coming to realize that none of the other noblemen had the same . . .\ndepth as Elend. None of them had his droll wit, or his honest, earnest eyes.\nThe others didn’t feel real. Not like he did."

However, he also didn’t seem to be\nmaking much of an effort to spend time with her.\nDid I misread him? she wondered as the carriage reached Fellise. Elend\nwas so hard to understand sometimes. Unfortunately, his apparent\nindecision hadn’t changed his former fiancée’s temperament. Vin was\nbeginning to realize why Kelsier had warned her to avoid catching the\nattention of anyone too important. She didn’t run into Shan Elariel often,\nthankfully—but when they did meet, Shan took every occasion to deride,\ninsult, and demean Vin. She did it with a calm, aristocratic manner, even her\nbearing reminding Vin just how inferior she was.\nPerhaps I’m just becoming too attached to my Valette persona, Vin\nthought. Valette was just a front; she was supposed to be all the things Shan\nsaid. However, the insults still stung.\nVin shook her head, putting both Shan and Elend out of her mind. Ash\nhad fallen during her trip to the city, and though it was done now, its\naftermath was visible in small drifts and flurries of black blowing across the\ntown’s streets. Skaa workers moved about, sweeping the soot into bins and\ncarrying it out of the city. They occasionally had to hurry to get out of the\nway of a passing noble carriage, none of which bothered to slow for the\nworkers.\nPoor things, Vin thought, passing a group of ragged children who were\nshaking aspen trees to get the ash out so that it could be swept up—it\nwouldn’t do for a passing nobleman to get an unexpected dump of tree-\nborne ash on his head. The children shook, two to a tree, bringing furious\nblack showers down on their heads. Careful, cane-wielding taskmasters\nwalked up and down the street, making certain the work continued.\nElend and the others, she thought. They must not understand how bad life\nis for the skaa. They live in their pretty keeps, dancing, never really\nunderstanding the extent of the Lord Ruler’s oppression.\nShe could see beauty in the nobility—she wasn’t like Kelsier, hating\nthem outright. Some of them seemed quite kind, in their own way, and she\nwas beginning to think some of the stories skaa told about their cruelty must\nbe exaggerated. And yet, when she saw events like that poor boy’s\nexecution or the skaa children, she had to wonder. How could the nobility\nnot see? How could they not understand?\nShe sighed, looking away from the skaa as the carriage finally rolled up\nto Mansion Renoux. She immediately noticed a large gathering in the inner\ncourtyard, and she grabbed a fresh vial of metals, worrying that the Lord\nRuler had sent soldiers to arrest Lord Renoux. However, she quickly\nrealized that the crowd wasn’t made up of soldiers, but of skaa in simple\nworker’s clothing.\nThe carriage rolled through the gates, and Vin’s confusion deepened.\nBoxes and sacks lay in heaps among the skaa—many of them dusted with\nsoot from the recent ashfall.

The workers themselves bustled with activity,\nloading a series of carts. Vin’s carriage pulled to a stop in front of the\nmansion, and she didn’t wait for Sazed to open the door. She hopped out on\nher own, holding up her dress and stalking over to Kelsier and Renoux, who\nstood surveying the operation.\n“You’re running goods to the caves out of here?” Vin asked under her\nbreath as she reached the two men.\n“Curtsey to me, child,” Lord Renoux said. “Maintain appearances while\nwe can be seen.”\nVin did as ordered, containing her annoyance.\n“Of course we are, Vin,” Kelsier said. “Renoux has to do something with\nall of the weapons and supplies he’s been gathering. People would start\ngetting suspicious if they didn’t see him sending them away.”\nRenoux nodded. “Ostensibly, we’re sending this all via canal barges to\nmy plantation in the west. However, the barges will stop to drop off\nsupplies—and many of the canalmen—at the rebellion caverns. The barges\nand a few men will continue on to keep up appearances.”\n“Our soldiers don’t even know that Renoux is in on the plan,” Kelsier\nsaid, smiling. “They think he’s a nobleman that I’m scamming. Besides, this\nwill be a great opportunity for us to go and inspect the army. After a week\nor so at the caves, we can return to Luthadel on one of Renoux’s barges\ncoming east.”\nVin paused. “ ‘We’?” she asked, suddenly imagining weeks spent on the\nbarge, watching the same, dull scenery day, after day, after day as they\ntraveled. That would be even worse than traveling back and forth between\nLuthadel and Fellise.\nKelsier raised an eyebrow. “You sound worried. Apparently, someone’s\ncoming to enjoy her balls and parties.”\nVin flushed. “I just thought that I should be here. I mean, after all the\ntime I missed by being sick, I—”\nKelsier held up his hand, chuckling. “You’re staying; Yeden and I are the\nones going. I need to inspect the troops, and Yeden is going to take a turn\nwatching over the army so that Ham can come back to Luthadel. We’ll also\ntake my brother with us, then drop him at his insertion point with the\nMinistry acolytes up in Vennias. It’s a good thing you’re back—I want you\nto spend a little time with him before we leave.”\nVin frowned. “With Marsh?”\nKelsier nodded. “He’s a Misting Seeker. Bronze is one of the less useful\nmetals, especially for a full Mistborn, but Marsh claims he can show you a\nfew tricks. This will probably be your last chance to train with him.”\nVin glanced toward the gathering caravan. “Where is he?”\nKelsier frowned. “He’s late.”\nRuns in the family, I guess.\n“He should be here soon, child,” Lord Renoux said. “Perhaps you’d like\nto go take some refreshment inside?”"

Instead of going into the mansion, she wandered across the\ncourtyard, studying the goods and workers, who were packing the supplies\nonto carts for transport to the local canal docks. The grounds were kept well\nmaintained, and though the ash hadn’t been cleaned up yet, the low-cut\ngrass meant that she didn’t have to hold her dress up much to keep it from\ndragging.\nBeyond that, ash was surprisingly easy to get out of clothing. With proper\nwashing, and some expensive soaps, even a white garment could be\nrendered clean of ash. That was why the nobility could always have new-\nlooking clothing. It was such an easy, simple thing to divide the skaa and\nthe aristocracy.\nKelsier’s right, Vin thought. I am coming to enjoy being a noblewoman.\nAnd she was concerned about the changes her new lifestyle was\nencouraging inside of her. Once, her problems had been things like\nstarvation and beatings—now they were things like extended carriage rides\nand companions who arrived late for appointments. What did a\ntransformation like that do to a person?\nShe sighed to herself, walking amidst the supplies. Some of the boxes\nwould be filled with weapons—swords, war staves, bows—but the bulk of\nthe material was sacked foodstuffs. Kelsier said that forming an army\nrequired far more grain than it did steel.\nShe trailed her fingers along one stack of boxes, careful not to brush the\nash that was on top of them. She’d known that they’d be sending out a\nbarge this day, but she hadn’t expected Kelsier to go with it. Of course, he\nprobably hadn’t made the decision to go until a short time before—even the\nnew, more responsible Kelsier was an impulsive man. Perhaps that was a\ngood attribute in a leader. He wasn’t afraid to incorporate new ideas, no\nmatter when they occurred to him.\nMaybe I should ask to go with him, Vin thought idly. I’ve been playing\nthe noblewoman far too much lately. The other day, she’d caught herself\nsitting straight-backed in her carriage with a prim posture, despite the fact\nthat she was alone. She feared that she was losing her instincts—being\nValette was almost more natural to her now than being Vin was.\nBut of course she couldn’t leave. She had a lunch appointment with Lady\nFlavine to attend, not to mention the Hasting ball—it was going to be the\nsocial event of the month. If Valette was absent, it would take weeks to\nrepair the damage. Besides, there was always Elend. He’d probably forget\nabout her if she disappeared again.\nHe’s already forgotten you, she told herself. He’s barely spoken to you\nduring the last three parties. Keep your head on, Vin. This is all just another\nscam—a game, like the ones you pulled before. You’re building your\nreputation to gain information, not so that you can flirt and play.\nShe nodded to herself, resolute.

Vin paused, standing beside a large stack of boxes and\nwatching the men work. According to Dockson, the army’s recruitment was\npicking up.\nWe’re gaining momentum, Vin thought. I guess word is spreading. That\nwas good—assuming it didn’t spread too far.\nShe watched the packmen for a moment, sensing something . . . odd.\nThey seemed unfocused. After a few moments, she was able to determine\nthe source of their distraction. They kept shooting looks at Kelsier,\nwhispering as they worked. Vin inched closer—keeping to the side of the\nboxes—and burned tin.\n“. . . no, that’s him for certain,” one of the men whispered. “I saw the\nscars.”\n“He’s tall,” another said.\n“Of course he is. What did you expect?”\n“He spoke at the meeting where I was recruited,” another said. “The\nSurvivor of Hathsin.” There was awe in his tone.\nThe men moved on, walking over to gather more boxes. Vin cocked her\nhead, then began to move among the workers, listening. Not all of them\nwere discussing Kelsier, but a surprising number were. She also heard a\nnumber of references to the “Eleventh Metal.”\nSo that’s why, Vin thought. The rebellion’s momentum isn’t gathering—\nKelsier’s is. The men spoke of him in quiet, almost reverent, tones. For\nsome reason, that made Vin uncomfortable. She would never have been\nable to stand hearing similar things said about her. Yet, Kelsier took them in\nstride; his charismatic ego probably just fueled the rumors even more.\nI wonder if he’ll be able to let it go when this is all through. The other\ncrewmembers obviously had no interest in leadership, but Kelsier seemed to\nthrive on it. Would he really let the skaa rebellion take over? Would any\nman be able to relinquish that kind of power?\nVin frowned. Kelsier was a good man; he’d probably make a good ruler.\nHowever, if he did try to take control, it would smell of betrayal—a\nreneging on the promises that he had made to Yeden. She didn’t want to see\nthat from Kelsier.\n“Valette,” Kelsier called.\nVin jumped slightly, feeling a bit guilty. Kelsier pointed toward a carriage\nthat was pulling onto the mansion grounds. Marsh had arrived. She walked\nback as the carriage pulled up, and she reached Kelsier about the same time\nthat Marsh did.\nKelsier smiled, nodding toward Vin. “We won’t be ready to leave for a\nwhile yet,” he said to Marsh. “If you have time, could you show the kid a\nfew things?”\nMarsh turned toward her. He shared Kelsier’s lanky build and blond hair,\nbut he wasn’t as handsome. Maybe it was the lack of a smile.\nHe pointed up, toward the mansion’s fore-balcony. “Wait for me up\nthere.”\nVin opened her mouth to reply, but something about Marsh’s expression\nmade her shut it again.

He reminded her of the old times, several months\nago, when she had not questioned her superiors. She turned, leaving the\nthree, and made her way into the mansion.\nIt was a short trip up the stairs to the fore-balcony. When she arrived, she\npulled over a chair and seated herself beside the whitewashed wooden\nrailing. The balcony had, of course, already been scrubbed clean of ash.\nBelow, Marsh was still speaking with Kelsier and Renoux. Beyond them,\nbeyond even the sprawling caravan, Vin could see the barren hills outside of\nthe city, lit by red sunlight.\nOnly a few months playing noblewoman, and I already find anything that\nisn’t cultivated to be inferior. She’d never thought of the landscape as\n“barren” during the years she’d traveled with Reen. And Kelsier says the\nentire land used to be even more fertile than a nobleman’s garden.\nDid he think to reclaim such things? Keepers could, perhaps, memorize\nlanguages and religions, but they couldn’t create seeds for plants that had\nlong been extinct. They couldn’t make the ash stop falling or the mists go\naway. Would the world really change that much if the Final Empire were\ngone?\nBesides, didn’t the Lord Ruler have some right to his place? He’d\ndefeated the Deepness, or so he claimed. He’d saved the world, which—in a\ntwisted sort of way—made it his. What right did they have to try and take it\nfrom him?\nShe wondered about such things often, though she didn’t express her\nworries to the others. They all seemed committed to Kelsier’s plan; some\neven seemed to share his vision. But Vin was more hesitant. She had\nlearned, as Reen had taught, to be skeptical of optimism.\nAnd if there were ever a plan to be hesitant about, this was the one.\nHowever, she was getting past the point where she questioned herself.\nShe knew the reason she stayed in the crew. It wasn’t the plan; it was the\npeople. She liked Kelsier. She liked Dockson, Breeze, and Ham. She even\nliked the strange little Spook and his crotchety uncle. This was a crew\nunlike any other she’d worked with.\nIs that a good enough reason to let them get you killed? Reen’s voice\nasked.\nVin paused. She had been hearing his whispers in her mind less\nfrequently lately, but they were still there. Reen’s teachings, drilled into her\nover sixteen years of life, could not be idly discarded.\nMarsh arrived on the balcony a few moments later. He glanced at her\nwith those hard eyes of his, then spoke. “Kelsier apparently expects me to\nspend the evening training you in Allomancy. Let us get started.”\nVin nodded.\nMarsh eyed her, obviously expecting more of a response. Vin sat quietly.\nYou’re not the only one who can be terse, friend.\n“Very well,” Marsh said, sitting beside her, resting one arm on the\nbalcony railing. His voice sounded a little less annoyed when he\ncontinued.“Kelsier says that you have spent very little time training with the\ninternal mental abilities. Correct?”\nVin nodded again."

Correct?”\nVin nodded again.\n“I suspect that many full Mistborn neglect these powers,” Marsh said.\n“And that is a mistake. Bronze and copper may not be as flashy as other\nmetals, but they can be very powerful in the hands of someone properly\ntrained. The Inquisitors work through their manipulation of bronze, and the\nMisting underground survives because of its reliance upon copper.\n“Of the two powers, bronze is by far the more subtle. I can teach you\nhow to use it properly—if you practice what I show you, then you will have\nan advantage that many Mistborn dismiss.”\n“But, don’t other Mistborn know to burn copper?” Vin asked. “What is\nthe use of learning bronze if everyone you fight is immune to its powers?”\n“I see that you already think like one of them,” Marsh said. “Not\neveryone is Mistborn, girl—in fact, very, very few people are. And, despite\nwhat your kind likes to think, normal Mistings can kill people too. Knowing\nthat the man attacking you is a Thug rather than a Coinshot could very\neasily save your life.”\n“All right,” Vin said.\n“Bronze will also help you identify Mistborn,” Marsh said. “If you see\nsomeone using Allomancy when there is no Smoker nearby, and yet don’t\nsense them giving off Allomantic pulses, then you know that they are\nMistborn—either that, or they’re an Inquisitor. In either case, you should\nrun.”\nVin nodded silently, the wound in her side throbbing slightly.\n“There are great advantages to burning bronze, rather than just running\naround with your copper on. True, you Smoke yourself by using copper—\nbut in a way you also blind yourself. Copper makes you immune to having\nyour emotions Pushed or Pulled.”\n“But that’s a good thing.”\nMarsh cocked his head slightly. “Oh? And what would be the greater\nadvantage? Being immune to—but ignorant of—some Soother’s attentions?\nOr instead knowing—from your bronze—exactly which emotions he is\ntrying to suppress?”\nVin paused. “You can see something that specific?”\nMarsh nodded. “With care and practice, you can recognize very minute\nchanges in your opponents’ Allomantic burnings. You can identify precisely\nwhich parts of a person’s emotions a Soother or Rioter intends to influence.\nYou’ll also be able to tell when someone is flaring their metal. If you grow\nvery skilled, you might even be able to tell when they’re running low on\nmetals.”\nVin paused in thought.\n“You begin to see the advantage,” Marsh said. “Good. Now burn\nbronze.”\nVin did so. Immediately, she felt two rhythmic thumpings in the air. The\nsoundless pulses washed over her, like the beating of drums or the washings\nof ocean waves. They were mixed and muddled.\n“What do you sense?” Marsh asked.\n“I . . . think there are two different metals being burned. One’s coming\nfrom Kelsier down below; the other is coming from you.”\n“Good,” Marsh said appreciatively. “You’ve practiced.”\n“Not much,” Vin admitted.\nHe cocked an eyebrow. “Not much?

Focus only\non the Allomantic pulses.”\nVin did so. It wasn’t like hearing—not really. She had to concentrate to\ndistinguish anything specific about the pulses. One felt . . . like it was\nbeating against her. The other, in a strange sensation, felt like it was actually\npulling her toward it with each beat.\n“One’s a Pulling metal, isn’t it?” Vin asked, opening her eyes. “That\none’s Kelsier. You’re Pushing.”\n“Very good,” Marsh said. “He is burning iron, as I asked him to so that\nyou could practice. I—of course—am burning bronze.”\n“Do they all do that?” Vin asked. “Feel distinct, I mean?”\nMarsh nodded. “You can tell a Pulling metal from a Pushing metal by the\nAllomantic signature. Actually, that’s how some of the metals were\noriginally divided into their categories. It isn’t intuitive, for instance, that tin\nPulls while pewter Pushes.

She focused as hard as she could, but her sense of the\nmetals seemed . . . muddled. Fuzzy. After a few minutes, the lengths of the\nseparate pulses still seemed the same to her.\n“I can’t sense anything,” she said, dejected.\n“Good,” Marsh said flatly. “It took me six months of practice to\ndistinguish pulse lengths—if you’d done it on the first try, I’d have felt\nincompetent.”\nVin opened her eyes. “Why ask me to do it, then?”\n“Because you need to practice. If you can tell Pulling metals from\nPushing metals already . . . well, you apparently have talent. Perhaps as\nmuch talent as Kelsier has been bragging about.”\n“What was I supposed to see, then?” Vin asked.\n“Eventually, you’ll be able to sense two different pulse lengths. Internal\nmetals, like bronze and copper, give off longer pulses than external metals,\nlike iron and steel. Practice will also let you sense the three patterns within\nthe pulses: one for the physical metals, one for the mental metals, and one\nfor the two greater metals.\n“Pulse length, metal group, and Push-Pull variance—once you know\nthese three things, you will be able to tell exactly which metals your\nopponent is burning. A long pulse that beats against you and has a quick\npattern will be pewter—the internal Pushing physical metal.”\n“Why the names?” Vin asked. “External and internal?”\n“Metals come in groups of four—or, at least, the lower eight do. Two\nexternal metals, two internal metals—one each that Pushes, one each that"

Two\nexternal metals, two internal metals—one each that Pushes, one each that\nPulls. With iron, you Pull on something outside of yourself, with steel you\nPush on something outside of yourself. With tin you Pull on something\ninside of yourself, with pewter you Push on something inside of yourself.”\n“But, bronze and copper,” Vin said. “Kelsier called them internal metals,\nbut it seems like they affect external things. Copper keeps people from\nsensing when you use Allomancy.”\nMarsh shook his head. “Copper doesn’t change your opponents, it\nchanges something within yourself that has an effect on your opponents.\nThat’s why it is an internal metal. Brass, however, alters another person’s\nemotions directly—and is an external metal.”\nVin nodded thoughtfully. Then she turned, glancing toward Kelsier. “You\nknow a lot about all the metals, but you’re just a Misting, right?”\nMarsh nodded. He didn’t look like he intended to respond, though.\nLet’s try something, then, Vin thought, extinguishing her bronze. She\nlightly began burning copper to mask her Allomancy. Marsh didn’t react,\ninstead continuing to look down at Kelsier and the caravan.\nI should be invisible to his senses, she thought, carefully burning both\nzinc and brass. She reached, just as Breeze had been training her to do, and\nsubtly touched Marsh’s emotions. She suppressed his suspicions and\ninhibitions, while at the same time bringing out his sense of wistfulness.\nTheoretically, that would make him more likely to talk.\n“You must have learned somewhere?” Vin asked carefully.\nHe’ll see what I did for sure. He’s going to get angry and—\n“I Snapped when I was very young,” Marsh said. “I’ve had a long time to\npractice.”\n“So have a lot of people,” Vin said.\n“I . . . had reasons. They’re hard to explain.”\n“They always are,” Vin said, slightly increasing her Allomantic pressure.\n“You know how Kelsier feels about the nobility?” Marsh asked, turning\ntoward her, his eyes like ice.\nIroneyes, she thought. Like they said. She nodded to his question.\n“Well, I feel the same way about the obligators,” he said, turning away.\n“I’ll do anything to hurt them. They took our mother—that’s when I\nSnapped, and that’s when I vowed to destroy them. So, I joined the\nrebellion and started learning all I could about Allomancy. Inquisitors use it,\nso I had to understand it—understand everything I could, be as good as I\ncould, and are you Soothing me?”\nVin started, abruptly extinguishing her metals. Marsh turned back toward\nher again, his expression cold.\nRun! Vin thought. She almost did. It was nice to know that the old\ninstincts were still there, if buried just a bit.\n“Yes,” she said meekly.\n“You are good,” Marsh said. “I’d have never known if I hadn’t started\nrambling. Stop it.”\n“I already have.”\n“Good,” Marsh said. “That’s the second time you’ve altered my\nemotions. Never do it again.”"

Never do it again.”\nVin nodded. “Second time?”\n“The first was in my shop, eight months ago.”\nThat’s right. Why don’t I remember him? “I’m sorry.”\nMarsh shook his head, finally turning away. “You’re Mistborn—that’s\nwhat you do. He does the same thing.” He was looking down at Kelsier.\nThey sat quietly for a few moments.\n“Marsh?” Vin asked. “How did you know I was Mistborn? I only knew\nhow to Soothe back then.”\nMarsh shook his head. “You knew the other metals instinctively. You\nwere burning pewter and tin that day—just a tiny bit, barely noticeable. You\nprobably got the metals from water and dining utensils. Did you ever\nwonder why you survived when so many others died?”\nVin paused. I did live through a lot of beatings. A lot of days with no\nfood, nights spent in alleys during rain or ashfalls . . .\nMarsh nodded. “Very few people, even Mistborn, are so attuned to\nAllomancy that they burn metals instinctively. That’s what interested me in\nyou—that’s why I kept track of you and told Dockson where to find you.\nAnd, are you Pushing my emotions again?”\nVin shook her head. “I promise.”\nMarsh frowned, studying her with one of his stony gazes.\n“So stern,” Vin said quietly. “Like my brother.”\n“Were you close?”\n“I hated him,” Vin whispered.\nMarsh paused, then turned away. “I see.”\n“Do you hate Kelsier?”\nMarsh shook his head. “No, I don’t hate him. He’s frivolous and self-\nimportant, but he’s my brother.”\n“And that’s enough?” Vin asked.\nMarsh nodded.\n“I . . . have trouble understanding that,” Vin said honestly, looking out\nover the field of skaa, boxes, and sacks.\n“Your brother didn’t treat you well, I presume?”\nVin shook her head.\n“What about your parents?” Marsh said. “One was a nobleman. The\nother?”\n“Mad,” Vin said. “She heard voices. It got so bad that my brother was\nafraid to leave us alone with her. But, of course, he didn’t have a choice. . .\n.”\nMarsh sat quietly, not speaking. How did this get turned back to me? Vin\nthought. He’s no Soother, yet he’s getting as much out of me as I’m getting\nout of him.\nStill, it was good to speak it finally. She reached up, idly fingering her\nearring. “I don’t remember it,” she said, “but Reen said that he came home\none day and found my mother covered in blood. She’d killed my baby\nsister. Messily. Me, however, she hadn’t touched—except to give me an\nearring. Reen said . . . He said she was holding me on her lap, babbling and\nproclaiming me a queen, my sister’s corpse at our feet. He took me from my\nmother, and she fled. He saved my life, probably. That’s part of why I\nstayed with him, I guess. Even when it was bad.”"

Even when it was bad.”\nShe shook her head, glancing at Marsh. “Still, you don’t know how lucky\nyou are, having Kelsier as a brother.”\n“I suppose,” Marsh said. “I just . . . wish he wouldn’t treat people like\nplaythings. I’ve been known to kill obligators, but murdering men just\nbecause they’re noble . . .” Marsh shook his head. “It’s not just that, either.\nHe likes people to fawn over him.”\nHe had a point. However, Vin also detected something in his voice.\nJealousy? You’re the older brother, Marsh. You were the responsible one—\nyou joined the rebellion instead of working with thieves. It must have hurt\nthat Kelsier was the one everybody liked.\n“Still,” Marsh said, “he’s getting better. The Pits changed him. Her . . .\ndeath changed him.”\nWhat’s this? Vin thought, perking up slightly. There was definitely\nsomething here, too. Hurt. Deep hurt, more than a man should feel for a\nsister-in-law.\nSo that’s it. It wasn’t just “everyone” who liked Kelsier more, it was one\nperson in particular. Someone you loved.\n“Anyway,” Marsh said, his voice growing more firm. “The arrogance of\nthe past is behind him. This plan of his is insane, and I’m sure he’s partially\ndoing it just so he can enrich himself, but . . . well, he didn’t have to go to\nthe rebellion. He’s trying to do something good—though it will probably\nget him killed.”\n“Why go along if you’re so sure he’ll fail?”\n“Because he’s going to get me into the Ministry,” Marsh said. “The\ninformation I gather there will help the rebellion for centuries after Kelsier\nand I are dead.”\nVin nodded, glancing down at the courtyard. She spoke hesitantly.\n“Marsh, I don’t think it’s all behind him. The way he’s setting himself up\nwith the skaa . . . the way they’re starting to look at him . . .”\n“I know,” Marsh said. “It started with that ‘Eleventh Metal’ scheme of\nhis. I don’t know that we have to worry—this is just Kell playing his usual\ngames.”\n“It makes me wonder why he’s leaving on this trip,” Vin said. “He’ll be\naway from the action for a good month.”\nMarsh shook his head. “He’ll have an entire army full of men to perform\nfor. Besides, he needs to get out of the city. His reputation is growing too\nunwieldy, and the nobility is becoming too interested in the Survivor. If\nrumors got out that a man with scars on his arms is staying with Lord\nRenoux . . .”\nVin nodded, understanding.\n“Right now,” Marsh said, “he’s playing the part of one of Renoux’s\ndistant relatives. That man has to leave before someone connects him to the\nSurvivor. When Kell gets back, he’ll have to keep a low profile—sneaking\ninto the mansion instead of walking up the steps, keeping his hood up when\nhe’s in Luthadel.”"

When Kell gets back, he’ll have to keep a low profile—sneaking\ninto the mansion instead of walking up the steps, keeping his hood up when\nhe’s in Luthadel.”\nMarsh trailed off, then stood. “Anyway, I’ve given you the basics. Now\nyou just need to practice. Whenever you’re with Mistings, have them burn\nfor you and focus on their Allomantic pulses. If we meet again, I’ll show\nyou more, but there’s nothing else I can do until you’ve practiced.”\nVin nodded, and Marsh walked out the door without any other farewell.\nA few moments later, she saw him approach Kelsier and Renoux again.\nThey really don’t hate each other, Vin thought, resting with both arms\ncrossed atop the railing. What would that be like? After some thought, she\ndecided that the concept of loving siblings was a little like the Allomantic\npulse lengths she was supposed to be looking for—they were just too\nunfamiliar for her to understand at the moment.\n“The Hero of Ages shall be not a man, but a force. No nation may claim him, no woman shall keep him, and no king may slay him. He shall belong to none, not even\nhimself.”\n21\nK his boat moved slowly along the canal to the north.\nELSIER SAT QUIETLY, READING AS\nSometimes, I worry that I’m not the hero everyone thinks I am, the text said.\nWhat proof do we have? The words of men long dead, only now deemed divinatory? Even if we accept the prophecies, only tenuous interpretation links them to me. Is my\ndefense of the Summer Hill really the “Burden by which the Hero shall be dubbed”? My several marriages could give me a “Bloodless bond to the world’s kings,” if you\nlook at it the right way. There are dozens of similar phrases that could refer to events in my life. But, then again, they could all just be coincidences.\nThe philosophers assure me that this is the time, that the signs have been met. But I still wonder if they have the wrong man. So many people depend on me. They\nsay I will hold the future of the entire world on my arms. What would they think if they knew that their champion—the Hero of Ages, their savior—doubted himself?\nPerhaps they wouldn’t be shocked at all. In a way, this is what worries me most. Maybe, in their hearts, they wonder—just like I do. When they see me, do they see a\nliar?\nRashek seems to think so. I know that I shouldn’t let a simple packman perturb me. However, he is from Terris, where the prophecies originated. If anyone could\nspot a fraud, would it not be he?\nNevertheless, I continue my trek, going where the scribbled auguries proclaim that I will meet my destiny—walking, feeling Rashek’s eyes on my back. Jealous.\nMocking. Hating.\nIn the end, I worry that my arrogance shall destroy us all.\nKelsier lowered the booklet, his cabin shaking slightly from the efforts of\nthe pullers outside. He was glad that Sazed had provided him with a copy of\nthe translated portions of the Lord Ruler’s logbook before the caravan\nboats’ departure. There was blessed little else to do during the trip."

There was blessed little else to do during the trip.\nFortunately, the logbook was fascinating. Fascinating, and eerie. It was\ndisturbing to read words that had originally been written by the Lord Ruler\nhimself. To Kelsier the Lord Ruler was less a man, and more a . . . creature.\nAn evil force that needed to be destroyed.\nYet, the person presented in the logbook seemed all too mortal. He\nquestioned and pondered—he seemed a man of depth, and even of\ncharacter.\nThough, it would be best not to trust his narrative too closely, Kelsier\nthought, running his fingers across the page. Men rarely see their own\nactions as unjustified.\nStill, the Lord Ruler’s story reminded Kelsier of the legends he had heard\n—stories whispered by skaa, discussed by noblemen, and memorized by\nKeepers. They claimed that once, before the Ascension, the Lord Ruler had\nbeen the greatest of men. A beloved leader, a man entrusted with the fate of\nall mankind.\nUnfortunately, Kelsier knew how the story ended. The Final Empire itself\nwas the logbook’s legacy. The Lord Ruler hadn’t saved mankind; he had\nenslaved it instead. Reading a firsthand account, seeing the Lord Ruler’s\nself-doubt and internal struggles, only made the story that much more\ntragic.\nKelsier raised the booklet to continue; however, his boat began to slow.\nHe glanced out the window of his cabin, looking up the canal. Dozens of\nmen trudged along the towpath—a small road alongside the canal—pulling\nthe four barges and two narrowboats that made up their convoy. It was an\nefficient, if labor-intensive, way to travel; men pulling a barge across a\ncanal could move hundreds more pounds of weight than they could if\nforced to carry packs.\nThe men had pulled to a stop, however. Ahead, Kelsier could make out a\nlock mechanism, beyond which the canal split into two sections. A kind of\ncrossroads of waterways. Finally, Kelsier thought. His weeks of travel were\nover.\nKelsier didn’t wait for a messenger. He simply stepped out onto the deck\nof his narrowboat and slipped a few coins from his pouch into his hand.\nTime to be a bit ostentatious, he thought, dropping a coin to the wood. He\nburned steel and Pushed himself into the air.\nHe lurched upward at an angle, quickly gaining a height where he could\nsee the entire line of men—half pulling the boats, half walking and waiting\nfor their shifts. Kelsier flew in an arc, dropping another coin as he passed\nover one of the supply-laden barges, then Pushing against it when he began\nto descend. Would-be soldiers looked up, pointing in awe as Kelsier soared\nabove the canal.\nKelsier burned pewter, strengthening his body as he thumped to the deck\nof the narrowboat leading the caravan.\nYeden stepped out of his cabin, surprised. “Lord Kelsier! We’ve, uh,\narrived at the crossroads.”"

We’ve, uh,\narrived at the crossroads.”\n“I can see that,” Kelsier said, glancing back along the line of boats. The\nmen on the towpath spoke excitedly, pointing. It felt strange to use\nAllomancy so obviously in the daylight, and before so many people.\nThere’s no help for it, he thought. This visit is the last chance the men will\nhave to see me for months. I need to make an impression, give them\nsomething they can hold on to, if this is all going to work. . . .\n“Shall we go see if the group from the caves has arrived to meet us?”\nKelsier asked, turning back to Yeden.\n“Of course,” Yeden said, waving for a servant to pull his narrowboat up\nto the side of the canal and throw out the plank. Yeden looked excited; he\nreally was an earnest man, and that much Kelsier could respect, even if he\nwas a bit lacking in presence.\nMost of my life, I’ve had the opposite problem, Kelsier thought with\namusement, walking with Yeden off of the boat.\nToo much presence, not enough earnestness.\nThe two of them walked up the line of canal workers. Near the front of\nthe men, one of Ham’s Thugs—playing the part of Kelsier’s guard captain\n—saluted. “We’ve reached the crossroads, Lord Kelsier.”\n“I can see that,” Kelsier repeated. A dense stand of birch trees grew\nahead, running up a slope into the hills. The canals ran away from the\nwoods—there were better sources of wood in other parts of the Final\nEmpire. The forest stood alone and ignored by most.\nKelsier burned tin, wincing slightly at the suddenly blinding sunlight. His\neyes adjusted, however, and he was able to pick out detail—and a slight bit\nof motion—in the forest.\n“There,” he said, flipping a coin into the air, then Pushing it. The coin\nzipped forward and thocked against a tree. The prearranged sign given, a\nsmall group of camouflaged men left the tree line, crossing the ash-stained\nearth toward the canal.\n“Lord Kelsier,” the foremost man said, saluting. “My name is Captain\nDemoux. Please, gather the recruits and come with me—General Hammond\nis eager to meet with you.”\n“Captain” Demoux was a young man to be so disciplined. Barely into his\ntwenties, he led his small squad of men with a level of solemnity that might\nhave seemed self-important had he been any less competent.\nYounger men than he have led soldiers into battle, Kelsier thought. Just\nbecause I was a fop when I was that age doesn’t mean that everyone is.\nLook at poor Vin—only sixteen, already a match for Marsh in seriousness.\nThey took a roundabout passage through the forest—by Ham’s order,\neach troop took a different path to avoid wearing a trail. Kelsier glanced\nback at the two hundred or so men behind, frowning slightly. Their trail\nwould probably still be visible, but there was little he could do about that—\nthe movements of so many men would be nearly impossible to mask."

Their trail\nwould probably still be visible, but there was little he could do about that—\nthe movements of so many men would be nearly impossible to mask.\nDemoux slowed, waving, and several members of his squad scrambled\nforward; they didn’t have half their leader’s sense of military decorum.\nStill, Kelsier was impressed. The last time he’d visited, the men had been\ntypically ragtag and uncoordinated, like most skaa outcasts. Ham and his\nofficers had done their work well.\nThe soldiers pulled away some false underbrush, revealing a crack in the\nground. It was dark within, the sides jutting with crystalline granite. It\nwasn’t a regular hillside cavern, but instead a simple rend in the ground\nleading directly down.\nKelsier stood quietly, looking down at the black, stone-laced rift. He\nshivered slightly.\n“Kelsier?” Yeden asked, frowning. “What is it?”\n“It reminds me of the Pits. They looked like this—cracks in the ground.”\nYeden paled slightly. “Oh. I, uh . . .”\nKelsier waved dismissively. “I knew this was coming. I climbed down\ninside those caves every day for a year, and I always came back out. I beat\nthem. They have no power over me.”\nTo prove his words, he stepped forward and climbed down into the thin\ncrack. It was just wide enough for a large man to slip through. As Kelsier\ndescended, he saw the soldiers—both Demoux’s squad and the new recruits\n—watching quietly. He had intentionally spoken loud enough for them to\nhear.\nLet them see my weakness, and let them see me overcome it.\nThey were brave thoughts. However, once he passed beneath the surface,\nit was as if he were back again. Smashed between two walls of stone,\nquesting downward with shaking fingers. Cold, damp, dark. Slaves had to\nbe the ones who recovered the atium. Allomancers might have been more\neffective, but using Allomancy near atium crystals shattered them. So, the\nLord Ruler used condemned men. Forcing them into the pits. Forcing them\nto crawl downward, ever downward . . .\nKelsier forced himself onward. This wasn’t Hathsin. The crack wouldn’t\ngo down for hours, and there would be no crystal-lined holes to reach\nthrough with torn, bleeding arms—stretching, seeking the atium geode\nhidden within. One geode; that bought one more week of life. Life beneath\nthe taskmasters’ lashes. Life beneath the rule of a sadistic god. Life beneath\nthe sun gone red.\nI will change things for the others, Kelsier thought. I will make it better!\nThe climb was difficult for him, more difficult than he ever would have\nadmitted. Fortunately, the crack soon opened up to a larger cavern beneath,\nand Kelsier caught a glimpse of light from below. He let himself drop the\nrest of the way, landing on the uneven stone floor, and smiled at the man\nwho stood waiting.\n“Hell of an entryway you’ve got there, Ham,” Kelsier said, dusting off\nhis hands.\nHam smiled. “You should see the bathroom.”\nKelsier laughed, moving to make way for the others.

Several natural\ntunnels led off of the chamber, and a small rope ladder hung from the\nbottom of the rift to facilitate going back up. Yeden and Demoux soon\nclimbed down the ladder into the cavern, their clothing scraped and dirtied\nfrom the descent. It wasn’t an easy entrance to get through. That, however,\nwas the idea.\n“It’s good to see you, Kell,” Ham said. It was odd to see him in clothing\nthat wasn’t missing the sleeves. In fact, his militaristic outfit looked rather\nformal, with square-cut lines and buttons down the front. “How many have\nyou brought me?”\n“Just over two hundred and forty.”\nHam raised his eyebrows. “Recruitment has picked up, then?”\n“Finally,” Kelsier said with a nod. Soldiers began to drop into the cavern,\nand several of Ham’s aides moved forward, helping the newcomers and\ndirecting them down a side tunnel.\nYeden moved over to join Kelsier and Ham. “This cavern is amazing,\nLord Kelsier! I’ve never actually been to the caves myself. No wonder the\nLord Ruler hasn’t found the men down here!”\n“The complex is completely secure,” Ham said proudly. “There are only\nthree entrances, all of them cracks like this one. With proper supplies, we\ncould hold this place indefinitely against an invading force.”\n“Plus,” Kelsier said,“this isn’t the only cave complex beneath these hills.\nEven if the Lord Ruler were determined to destroy us, his army could spend\nweeks searching and still not find us.”\n“Amazing,” Yeden said. He turned, eyeing Kelsier. “I was wrong about\nyou, Lord Kelsier. This operation . . . this army . . . well, you’ve done\nsomething impressive here.”\nKelsier smiled. “Actually, you were right about me. You believed in me\nwhen this started—we’re only here because of you.”\n“I . . . guess I did, didn’t I?” Yeden said, smiling.\n“Either way,” Kelsier said, “I appreciate the vote of confidence. It’s\nprobably going to take some time to get all these men down the crack—\nwould you mind directing things here? I’d like to talk to Hammond for a\nbit.”\n“Of course, Lord Kelsier.” There was respect—even a growing bit of\nadulation—in his voice.\nKelsier nodded to the side. Ham frowned slightly, picking up a lantern,\nthen followed Kelsier from the first chamber. They entered a side tunnel,\nand once they were out of earshot, Ham paused, glancing backward.\nKelsier stopped, raising an eyebrow.\nHam nodded back toward the entry chamber. “Yeden certainly has\nchanged.”\n“I have that effect on people.”\n“Must be your awe-inspiring humility,” Ham said. “I’m serious, Kell.\nHow do you do it? That man practically hated you; now he looks at you like\na kid idolizing his big brother.”\nKelsier shrugged. “Yeden’s never been part of an effective team before—\nI think he’s started to realize that we might actually have a chance. In little\nover half a year, we’ve gathered a rebellion larger than he’s ever seen."

In little\nover half a year, we’ve gathered a rebellion larger than he’s ever seen.\nThose kind of results can convert even the stubborn.”\nHam didn’t look convinced. Finally, he just shrugged, beginning to walk\nagain. “What was it you wanted to talk about?”\n“Actually, I’d like to visit the other two entrances, if we could,” Kelsier\nsaid.\nHam nodded, pointing to a side tunnel and leading the way. The tunnel,\nlike most of the others, hadn’t been hollowed by human hands; it was a\nnatural growth of the cave complex. There were hundreds of similar cave\nsystems in the Central Dominance, though most weren’t as extensive. And\nonly one—the Pits of Hathsin—grew atium geodes.\n“Anyway, Yeden’s right,” Ham said, twisting his way through a narrow\nplace in the tunnel. “You picked a great place to hide these people.”\nKelsier nodded. “Various rebel groups have been using the cavern\ncomplexes in these hills for centuries. They’re frighteningly close to\nLuthadel, but the Lord Ruler has never led a successful raid against anyone\nhere. He just ignores the place now—one too many failures, probably.”\n“I don’t doubt it,” Ham said. “With all the nooks and bottlenecks down\nhere, this would be a nasty place to have a battle.” He stepped out of the\npassageway, entering another small cavern. This one also had a rift in the\nceiling, and faint sunlight trickled down. A squad of ten soldiers stood\nguard in the room, and they snapped to attention as soon as Ham entered.\nKelsier nodded approvingly. “Ten men at all times?”\n“At each of the three entrances,” Ham said.\n“Good,” Kelsier said. He walked forward, inspecting the soldiers. He\nwore his sleeves up, his scars showing, and he could see the men eyeing\nthem. He didn’t really know what to inspect, but he tried to look\ndiscriminating. He examined their weapons—staves for eight of the men,\nswords for two—and dusted off a few shoulders, though none of the men\nwore uniforms.\nFinally, he turned to a soldier who bore an insignia on his shoulder. “Who\ndo you let out of the caverns, soldier?”\n“Only men bearing a letter sealed by General Hammond himself, sir!”\n“No exceptions?” Kelsier asked.\n“No, sir!”\n“And if I wanted to leave right now?”\nThe man paused. “Uh . . .”\n“You’d stop me!” Kelsier said. “No one is exempt, soldier. Not me, not\nyour bunkmate, not an officer—no one. If they don’t have that seal, they\ndon’t leave!”\n“Yes, sir!” the soldier said.\n“Good man,” Kelsier said. “If all of your soldiers are this fine, General,\nthen the Lord Ruler has good reason to be afraid.”\nThe soldiers puffed up slightly at the words.\n“Carry on, men,” Kelsier said, waving for Ham to follow as he left the\nroom.\n“That was kind of you,” Ham said softly. “They’ve been anticipating\nyour visit for weeks.”\nKelsier shrugged. “I just wanted to see that they were guarding the crack"

Now that you have more men, I want you to post guards at any\ntunnels leading to these exit caverns.”\nHam nodded. “Seems a bit extreme, though.”\n“Humor me,” Kelsier said. “A single runaway or malcontent could betray\nus all to the Lord Ruler. It’s nice that you feel that you could defend this\nplace, but if there’s an army camped outside trapping you in, this army will\neffectively become useless to us.”\n“All right,” Ham said. “You want to see the third entrance?”\n“Please,” Kelsier said.\nHam nodded, leading him down another tunnel.\n“Oh, one other thing,” Kelsier said after a bit of walking. “Get together\ngroups of a hundred men—all ones you trust—to go tromp around up in the\nforest. If someone comes looking for us, we won’t be able to hide the fact\nthat lots of people have passed through the area. However, we might be able\nto muddle the tracks so much that the trails all lead nowhere.”\n“Good idea.”\n“I’m full of ’em,” Kelsier said as they stepped into another cave chamber,\nthis one far larger than the previous two. It wasn’t an entrance rift, but\ninstead a practice room. Groups of men stood with swords or staves,\nsparring beneath the eye of uniformed instructors. Uniforms for the officers\nhad been Dockson’s idea. They couldn’t afford to outfit all the men—it\nwould be too expensive, and obtaining that many uniforms would look\nsuspicious. However, maybe seeing their leaders in uniform would help\ngive the men a sense of cohesion.\nHam paused at the edge of the room rather than continuing onward. He\neyed the soldiers, speaking softly. “We need to talk about this sometime,\nKell. The men are starting to feel like soldiers, but . . . Well, they’re skaa.\nThey’ve spent their lives working in mills or fields. I don’t know how well\nthey’ll do when we actually get them onto a battlefield.”\n“If we do everything right, they won’t have to do much fighting,” Kelsier\nsaid. “The Pits are only guarded by a couple hundred soldiers—the Lord\nRuler can’t have too many men there, lest he hint at the location’s\nimportance. Our thousand men can take the Pits with ease, then retreat as\nsoon as the Garrison arrives. The other nine thousand might have to face a\nfew Great House guard squads and the palace soldiers, but our men should\nhave the upper hand in numbers.”\nHam nodded, though his eyes still seemed uncertain.\n“What?” Kelsier asked, leaning against the smooth, crystalline mouth of\nthe cavern juncture.\n“And when we’re done with them, Kell?” Ham asked. “Once we have\nour atium, we give the city—and the army—over to Yeden. Then what?”\n“That’s up to Yeden,” Kelsier said.\n“They’ll be slaughtered,” Ham said very softly. “Ten thousand men can’t\nhold Luthadel against the entire Final Empire.”\n“I intend to give them a better chance than you think, Ham,” Kelsier said."

Raise an army, deliver it to Yeden.”\n“I know,” Ham said, sighing and leaning back against the cavern wall. “I\nguess . . . Well, it’s different, now that I’ve been leading them. Maybe I’m\njust not meant to be in charge like this. I’m a bodyguard, not a general.”\nI know how you feel, my friend, Kelsier thought. I’m a thief, not a\nprophet. Sometimes, we just have to be what the job requires.\nKelsier laid a hand on Ham’s shoulder. “You did a fine job here.”\nHam paused. “ ‘Did’ fine?”\n“I brought Yeden to replace you. Dox and I decided it would be better to\nrotate him in as the army’s commander—that way, the troops get used to\nhim as their leader. Besides, we need you back in Luthadel. Someone has to\nvisit the Garrison and gather intelligence, and you’re the only one with any\nmilitary contacts.”\n“So, I’m going back with you?” Ham asked.\nKelsier nodded.\nHam looked crestfallen for just a moment, then he relaxed, smiling. “I’ll\nfinally be able get out of this uniform! But, do you think Yeden can handle\nit?”\n“You said yourself, he’s changed a lot during the last few months. And,\nhe really is an excellent administrator—he’s done a fine job with the\nrebellion since my brother left.”\n“I suppose. . . .”\nKelsier shook his head ruefully. “We’re spread thin, Ham. You and\nBreeze are two of the only men I know I can trust, and I need you back in\nLuthadel. Yeden’s not perfect for the job here, but the army is going to be\nhis, eventually. Might as well let him lead it for a time. Besides, it will give\nhim something to do; he’s growing a bit touchy about his place in the crew.”\nKelsier paused, then smiled in amusement. “I think he’s jealous of the\nattention I pay the others.”\nHam smiled. “That is a change.”\nThey began to walk again, leaving the practice chamber behind. They\nentered another twisting stone tunnel, this one leading slightly downward,\nHam’s lantern providing their only light.\n“You know,” Ham said after a few minutes of walking, “there’s\nsomething else nice about this place. You’ve probably noticed this before,\nbut it certainly is beautiful down here sometimes.”\nKelsier hadn’t noticed. He glanced to the side as they walked. One edge\nof the chamber had been formed of dripping minerals from the ceiling, thin\nstalactites and stalagmites—like dirty icicles—melding together to form a\nkind of banister. Minerals twinkled in Ham’s light, and the path in front of\nthem seemed to be frozen in the form of a tumbling molten river."

No, I don’t see its beauty, Ham. Other men might see\nart in the layers of color and melted rock. Kelsier only saw the Pits. Endless\ncaves, most of them going straight down. He’d been forced to wiggle\nthrough cracks, plunging downward in the darkness, not even given a light\nto brighten his way.\nOften, he’d considered not climbing back up. But, then he would find a\ncorpse in the caves—the body of another prisoner, a man who had gotten\nlost, or who had perhaps just given up. Kelsier would feel their bones and\npromise himself more. Each week, he’d found an atium geode. Each week\nhe’d avoided execution by brutal beating.\nExcept that last time. He didn’t deserve to be alive—he should have been\nkilled. But, Mare had given him an atium geode, promising him that she’d\nfound two that week. It wasn’t until after he’d turned it in that he’d\ndiscovered her lie. She’d been beaten to death the next day. Beaten to death\nright in front of him.\nThat night, Kelsier had Snapped, coming into his powers as a Mistborn.\nThe next night, men had died.\nMany men.\nSurvivor of Hathsin. A man who shouldn’t live. Even after watching her\ndie, I couldn’t decide if she’d betrayed me or not. Did she give me that\ngeode out of love? Or did she do it out of guilt?\nNo, he couldn’t see beauty in the caverns. Other men had been driven\nmad by the Pits, becoming terrified of small, enclosed spaces. That hadn’t\nhappened to Kelsier. However, he knew that no matter what wonders the\nlabyrinths held—no matter how amazing the views or delicate the beauties\n—he would never acknowledge them. Not with Mare dead.\nI can’t think about this anymore, Kelsier decided, the cavern seeming to\ngrow darker around him. He glanced to the side. “All right, Ham. Go ahead.\nTell me what you’re thinking about.”\n“Really?” Ham said eagerly.\n“Yes,” Kelsier said with a sense of resignation.\n“All right,” Ham said. “So, here’s what I’ve been worried about lately:\nAre skaa different from noblemen?”\n“Of course they are,” Kelsier said. “The aristocracy has the money and\nthe land; the skaa don’t have anything.”\n“I don’t mean economics—I’m talking about physical differences. You\nknow what the obligators say, right?”\nKelsier nodded.\n“Well, is it true? I mean, skaa really do have a lot of children, and I’ve\nheard that aristocrats have trouble reproducing.”\nThe Balance, it was called. It was supposedly the way that the Lord Ruler\nensured that there weren’t too many noblemen for the skaa to support, and\nthe way he made certain that—despite beatings and random killings—there\nwere always enough skaa to grow food and work in mills.\n“I’ve always just assumed it to be Ministry rhetoric,” Kelsier said\nhonestly."

They say you used to be able to tell skaa and\nnoblemen apart by sight alone. That’s changed, probably through\ninterbreeding, but most skaa are still kind of short.”\n“That’s nutritional. Skaa don’t get enough to eat.”\n“What about Allomancy?”\nKelsier frowned.\n“You have to admit that there’s a physical difference there,” Ham said.\n“Skaa never become Mistings unless they have aristocratic blood\nsomewhere in their last five generations.”\nThat much, at least, was true.\n“Skaa think differently from noblemen, Kell,” Ham said. “Even these\nsoldiers are kind of timid, and they’re the brave ones! Yeden’s right about\nthe general skaa population—it will never rebel. What if . . . what if there\nreally is something physically different about us? What if the noblemen are\nright to rule over us?”\nKelsier froze in the hallway. “You don’t really mean that.”\nHam stopped as well. “I guess . . . no, I don’t. But I do wonder\nsometimes. The noblemen have Allomancy, right? Maybe they’re meant to\nbe in charge.”\n“Meant by who? The Lord Ruler?”\nHam shrugged.\n“No, Ham,” Kelsier said. “It isn’t right. This isn’t right. I know it’s hard\nto see—things have been this way for so long—but something very serious\nis wrong with the way skaa live. You have to believe that.”\nHam paused, then nodded. “Let’s go,” Kelsier said. “I want to visit that\nother entrance.”\nThe week passed slowly. Kelsier inspected the troops, the training, the food,\nthe weapons, the supplies, the scouts, the guards, and just about everything\nelse he could think of. More important, he visited the men. He\ncomplimented and encouraged them—and he made certain to use\nAllomancy frequently in front of them.\nWhile many skaa had heard of “Allomancy,” very few knew specifically\nwhat it could do. Nobleman Mistings rarely used their powers in front of\nother people, and half-breeds had to be even more careful. Ordinary skaa,\neven city skaa, didn’t know of things like Steelpushing or Pewter-burning.\nWhen they saw Kelsier flying through the air or sparring with supernatural\nstrength, they would just attribute it to formless “Allomancy Magics.”\nKelsier didn’t mind the misunderstanding at all.\nDespite all of the week’s activities, however, he never forgot his\nconversation with Ham.\nHow could he even wonder if skaa are inferior? Kelsier thought, poking\nat his meal as he sat at the high table in the central meeting cavern. The\nmassive “room” was large enough to hold the entire army of seven thousand\nmen, though many sat in side chambers or halfway out into tunnels. The\nhigh table sat on a raised rock formation at the far end of the chamber."

The\nhigh table sat on a raised rock formation at the far end of the chamber.\nI’m probably worrying too much. Ham was prone to think about things\nthat no sane man would consider; this was just another of his philosophical\ndilemmas. In fact, he already seemed to have forgotten his earlier concerns.\nHe laughed with Yeden, enjoying his meal.\nAs for Yeden, the gangly rebel leader looked quite satisfied with his\ngeneral’s uniform, and had spent the week taking very serious notes from\nHam regarding the army’s operation. He seemed to be falling quite\nnaturally into his duties.\nIn fact, Kelsier seemed to be the only one who wasn’t enjoying the feast.\nThe evening’s foods—brought on the barges especially for the occasion—\nwere humble by aristocratic standards, but were much finer than what the\nsoldiers were used to. The men relished the meal with a joyful\nboisterousness, drinking their small allotment of ale and celebrating the\nmoment.\nAnd still, Kelsier worried. What did these men think they were fighting\nfor? They seemed enthusiastic about their training, but that might have just\nbeen due to the regular meals. Did they actually believe that they deserved\nto overthrow the Final Empire? Did they think that skaa were inferior to\nnoblemen?\nKelsier could sense their reservations. Many of the men realized the\nimpending danger, and only the strict exit rules kept them from fleeing.\nWhile they were eager to speak of their training, they avoided talking about\ntheir final task—that of seizing the palace and city walls, then holding off\nthe Luthadel Garrison.\nThey don’t think they can succeed, Kelsier guessed. They need\nconfidence. The rumors about me are a start, but . . .\nHe nudged Ham, getting the man’s attention.\n“Are there any men who have given you discipline problems?” Kelsier\nasked quietly.\nHam frowned at the odd question. “There are a couple, of course. I’d\nthink there are always dissidents in a group this large.”\n“Anyone in particular?” Kelsier asked. “Men who have wanted to leave?\nI need someone outspoken in their opposition to what we’re doing.”\n“There are a couple in the brig right now,” Ham said.\n“Anyone here?” Kelsier asked. “Preferably someone sitting at a table we\ncan see?”\nHam thought for a moment, scanning the crowd. “The man sitting at the\nsecond table with the red cloak. He was caught trying to escape a couple\nweeks ago.”\nThe man in question was scrawny and twitchy; he sat at his table with a\nhunched, solitary posture.\nKelsier shook his head. “I need someone a bit more charismatic.”\nHam rubbed his chin in thought. Then he paused, and nodded toward\nanother table. “Bilg. The big guy sitting at the fourth table over on the\nright.”\n“I see him,” Kelsier said. Bilg was a brawny man wearing a vest and a\nfull beard.\n“He’s too clever to be insubordinate,” Ham said, “but he’s been making\ntrouble quietly. He doesn’t think we have a chance against the Final Empire."

He doesn’t think we have a chance against the Final Empire.\nI’d lock him up, but I can’t really punish a man for expressing fear—or, at\nleast, if I did, I’d have to do the same for half the army. Besides, he’s too\ngood a warrior to discard idly.”\n“He’s perfect,” Kelsier said. He burned zinc, then looked toward Bilg.\nWhile zinc wouldn’t let him read the man’s emotions, it was possible—\nwhen burning the metal—to isolate just a single individual for Soothing or\nRioting, much as one was able to isolate a single bit of metal from hundreds\nto Pull on.\nEven still, it was difficult to single Bilg out from such a large crowd, so\nKelsier just focused on the entire tableful of men, keeping their emotions\n“in hand” for later use. Then he stood. Slowly, the cavern quieted.\n“Men, before I leave, I wish to express one last time how much I was\nimpressed by this visit.” His words rang through the room, amplified by the\ncavern’s natural acoustics.\n“You are becoming a fine army,” Kelsier said. “I apologize for stealing\nGeneral Hammond, but I leave a very competent man in his place. Many of\nyou know General Yeden—you know of his many years serving as rebellion\nleader. I have confidence in his ability to train you even further in the ways\nof soldiers.”\nHe began to Riot Bilg and his companions, enflaming their emotions,\ncounting on the fact that they’d be feeling disagreeable.\n“It is a great task I ask of you,” Kelsier said, not looking at Bilg. “Those\nskaa outside of Luthadel—indeed, most skaa everywhere—have no idea\nwhat you are about to do for them. They aren’t aware of the training you\nendure or the battles you prepare to fight. However, they will reap the\nrewards. Someday, they will call you heroes.”\nHe Rioted Bilg’s emotions even harder.\n“The Garrison of Luthadel is strong,” Kelsier said, “but we can defeat it\n—especially if we take the city walls quickly. Do not forget why you came\nhere. This isn’t simply about learning to swing a sword or wear a helm. This\nis about a revolution such as the world has never seen—it is about taking\nthe government for ourselves, about ousting the Lord Ruler. Do not lose\nsight of your goal.”\nKelsier paused. From the corner of his eye, he could see dark expressions\nfrom the men at Bilg’s table. Finally, in the silence, Kelsier heard a\nmuttered comment from the table—carried by cavern acoustics to many\nears.\nKelsier frowned, turning toward Bilg. The entire cavern seemed to grow\neven more still. “Did you say something?” Kelsier asked. Now, the moment\nof decision. Will he resist, or will he be cowed?\nBilg looked back. Kelsier hit the man with a flared Riot. His reward came\nas Bilg stood from his table, face red.\n“Yes, sir,” the brawny man snapped. “I did say something. I said that"

Rumbling whispers began to sound at\nthe back of the cavern as soldiers passed the news to those too far away to\nhear.\nBilg took a deep breath. “Because, sir, we think that this is suicide you’re\nsending us to. The Final Empire’s armies are bigger than just one garrison.\nIt won’t matter if we take the walls—we’ll get slaughtered eventually\nanyway. You don’t overthrow an empire with a couple thousand soldiers.”\nPerfect, Kelsier thought. I’m sorry, Bilg. But someone needed to say it,\nand it certainly couldn’t be me.\n“I see we have a disagreement,” Kelsier said loudly. “I believe in these\nmen, and in their purpose.”\n“I believe that you are a deluded fool,” Bilg bellowed. “And I was a\nbigger fool for coming to these bloody caves. If you’re so certain about our\nchances, then why can’t anyone leave? We’re trapped here until you send us\nto die!”\n“You insult me,” Kelsier snapped. “You know very well why men aren’t\nallowed to leave. Why do you want to go, soldier? Are you that eager to sell\nout your companions to the Lord Ruler? A few quick boxings in exchange\nfor four thousand lives?”\nBilg’s face grew redder. “I would never do such a thing, but I’m certainly\nnot going to let you send me to my death, either! This army is a waste.”\n“You speak treason,” Kelsier said. He turned, scanning the crowd. “It is\nnot fitting for a general to fight a man beneath his command. Is there a\nsoldier here who is willing to defend the honor of this rebellion?”\nImmediately, a couple dozen men stood up. Kelsier noticed one in\nparticular. He was smaller than the rest, but he had the simple earnestness\nthat Kelsier had noticed earlier. “Captain Demoux.”\nImmediately, the young captain jumped forward.\nKelsier reached over, grabbing his own sword and tossing it down to the\nman. “You can use a sword, lad?”\n“Yes, sir!”\n“Someone fetch a weapon for Bilg and a pair of studded vests.” Kelsier\nturned toward Bilg. “Noblemen have a tradition. When two men have a\ndispute, they settle it with a duel. Defeat my champion, and you are free to\nleave.”\n“And if he defeats me?” Bilg asked.\n“Then you’ll be dead,” Kelsier said.\n“I’m dead if I stay,” Bilg said, accepting a sword from a nearby soldier.\n“I accept the terms.”\nKelsier nodded, waving for some men to pull aside tables and make an\nopen space before the high table. Men began to stand, crowding around to\nwatch the contest.\n“Kell, what are you doing!” Ham hissed at his side.\n“Something that needs to be done.”\n“Needs to be . . .

He sat quietly as Bilg and Demoux hefted\ntheir weapons, a pair of soldiers tying on their leather cuirasses. When they\nwere done, Kelsier waved a hand, motioning for the battle to begin.\nHam groaned.\nIt would be a short fight. Both men had longswords and little armor. Bilg\nstepped forward with confidence, making a few testing swings toward\nDemoux. The boy was at least competent—he blocked the blows, but he\nrevealed a great deal about his abilities as he did so.\nTaking a deep breath, Kelsier burned steel and iron.\nBilg swung, and Kelsier nudged the blade to the side, giving Demoux\nroom to escape. The boy tried a thrust, but Bilg easily knocked it away. The\nlarger warrior then attacked with a barrage, sending Demoux stumbling\nbackward. Demoux tried to jump out of the way of the last swing, but he\nwas too slow.

Demoux blocked\nthe powerful swing, but Bilg knocked the boy’s weapon aside with a\ncareless sweep. Bilg struck again, and Demoux raised a hand in reflexive\ndefense.\nKelsier Pushed, freezing Bilg’s sword in midswing. Demoux stood, hand\nforward, as if he had stopped the attacking weapon with a thought. The two\nstood like that for a moment, Bilg trying to force the sword forward,\nDemoux staring in awe at his hand. Standing up a bit straighter, Demoux\ntentatively forced his hand forward.\nKelsier Pushed, throwing Bilg backward. The large warrior tumbled to\nthe ground with a cry of surprise. When he rose a moment later, Kelsier\ndidn’t have to Riot his emotions to make him angry. He bellowed in rage,\ngrabbing his sword in two hands and rushing toward Demoux.\nSome men don’t know when to quit, Kelsier thought as Bilg swung.\nDemoux began to dodge. Kelsier shoved the boy to the side, getting him\nout of the way. Then Demoux turned, gripping his own weapon in two\nhands and swinging at Bilg.

Then, Demoux raised his hands, regarding them with wonder,\nhis arms quivering slightly.\nKelsier stood, and the crowd fell to a hush once again.\n“Do you think I would send you against the Lord Ruler unprepared?”\nKelsier demanded in a loud voice. “Do you think I would just send you off\nto die?

Then, he turned to Kelsier, pulling his chair closer and\nspeaking in a low voice. “You just lied to my entire army, Kell.”\n“No, Ham,” Kelsier said quietly. “I lied to my army.”\nHam paused.

They don’t need to be warriors,\nthey just have to look threatening long enough for us to grab the atium.\nWith it, we can bribe the Garrison, and our men won’t even have to fight.\nThat’s virtually the same thing as what I promised them.”\nHam didn’t respond.\n“Before we leave,” Kelsier said, “I want you to select a few dozen of our\nmost trustworthy and devoted soldiers. We’ll send them back to Luthadel—\nwith vows that they can’t reveal where the army is—so that word of this\nevening can spread amongst the skaa.”\n“So this is about your ego?” Ham snapped.\nKelsier shook his head. “Sometimes we need to do things that we find\ndistasteful, Ham. My ego may be considerable, but this is about something\nelse entirely.”\nHam sat for a moment, then turned back to his meal. He didn’t eat,\nhowever—he just sat staring at the blood on the ground before the high\ntable.\nAh, Ham, Kelsier thought. I wish I could explain everything to you.\nPlots behind plots, plans beyond plans.\nThere was always another secret.\nAt first, there were those who didn’t think the Deepness was a serious danger, at least not to them. However, it brought with it a blight that I have seen infect nearly every\npart of the land. Armies are useless before it. Great cities are laid low by its power. Crops fail, and the land dies.\nThis is the thing I fight. This is the monster I must defeat. I fear that I have taken too long. Already, so much destruction has occurred that I fear for mankind’s\nsurvival.\nIs this truly the end of the world, as many of the philosophers predict?\n22\nWe arrived in Terris earlier this week, Vin read, and, I have to say, I find the countryside beautiful. The great mountains to the north—with their bald snowcaps and\nforested mantles—stand like watchful gods over this land of green fertility. My own lands to the south are mostly flat; I think that they might look less dreary if there were\na few mountains to vary the terrain.\nThe people here are mostly herdsmen—though timber harvesters and farmers are not uncommon. It is a pastoral land, certainly. It seems odd that a place so\nremarkably agrarian could have produced the prophecies and theologies upon which the entire world now relies.\nWe picked up a group of Terris packmen to guide us through the difficult mountain passages. Yet, these are no ordinary men. The stories are apparently true—some\nTerrismen have a remarkable ability that is most intriguing.\nSomehow, they can store up their strength for use on the next day. Before they sleep at night, they spend an hour lying in their bedrolls, during which time they\nsuddenly grow very frail in appearance—almost as if they had aged by half a century. Yet, when they wake the next morning, they become quite muscular. Apparently,\ntheir powers have something to do with the metal bracelets and earrings that they always wear."

Nevertheless, Braches—inquisitive, as always—has promised to interrogate him in the hopes\nof discovering exactly how this wondrous strength-storing is achieved.\nTomorrow, we begin the final stage of our pilgrimage—the Far Mountains of Terris. There, hopefully, I will find peace—both for myself, and for our poor land.\nA of the logbook, Vin was quickly coming to several decisions.\nS SHE READ HER COPY\nFirst was the firm belief that she did not like reading. Sazed didn’t listen to\nher complaints; he just claimed that she hadn’t practiced enough. Couldn’t\nhe see that reading was hardly as practical a skill as being able to handle a\ndagger or use Allomancy?\nStill, she continued to read as per his orders—if only to stubbornly prove\nthat she could. Many of the logbook’s words were difficult to her, and she\nhad to read in a secluded part of Renoux’s mansion where she could sound\nout the words to herself, trying to decipher the Lord Ruler’s odd style of\nwriting.\nThe continued reading led to her second conclusion: The Lord Ruler was\nfar more whiny than any god had a right to be. When pages of the logbook\nweren’t filled with boring notes about the Lord Ruler’s travels, they were\ninstead packed with internal contemplations and lengthy moralistic\nramblings. Vin was beginning to wish that she’d never found the book in\nthe first place.\nShe sighed, settling back into her wicker chair. A cool early-spring breeze\nblew through the lower gardens, passing over the petite fountain brook to\nher left. The air was comfortably moist, and the trees overhead shaded her\nfrom the afternoon sun. Being nobility—even fake nobility—certainly did\nhave its perks.\nA quiet footfall sounded behind her. It was distant, but Vin had grown\ninto the habit of burning a little bit of tin at all times. She turned, shooting a\ncovert glance over her shoulder.\n“Spook?” she said with surprise as young Lestibournes walked down the\ngarden path. “What are you doing here?”\nSpook froze, blushing. “Wasing with the Dox to come and be without the\nstay.”\n“Dockson?” Vin said. “He’s here too?” Maybe he has news of Kelsier!\nSpook nodded, approaching. “Weapons for the getting, giving for the\ntime to be.”\nVin paused. “You lost me on that one.”\n“We needed the drop off some more weapons,” Spook said, struggling to\nspeak without his dialect. “Storing them here for a while.”\n“Ah,” Vin said, rising and brushing off her dress. “I should go see him.”\nSpook looked suddenly apprehensive, flushing again, and Vin cocked her\nhead. “Was there something else?”\nWith a sudden movement, Spook reached into his vest and pulled\nsomething out. Vin flared pewter in response, but the item was simply a\npink-and-white handkerchief. Spook thrust it toward her.\nVin took it hesitantly. “What’s this for?”\nSpook flushed again, then turned and dashed away.\nVin watched him go, dumbfounded. She looked down at the"

        "text": "Vin took it hesitantly. “What’s this for?”\nSpook flushed again, then turned and dashed away.\nVin watched him go, dumbfounded. She looked down at the\nhandkerchief. It was made of soft lace, but there didn’t seem to be anything\nunusual about it.\nThat is one strange boy, she thought, tucking the handkerchief inside her\nsleeve. She picked up her copy of the logbook, then began to work her way\nup the garden path. She was growing so accustomed to wearing a dress that\nshe barely had to pay attention to keep the gown’s lower layers from\nbrushing against underbrush or stones.\nI guess that in itself is a valuable skill, Vin thought as she reached the\nmansion’s garden entrance without having snagged her dress on a single\nbranch. She pushed open the many-paned glass door and stopped the first\nservant she saw.\n“Master Delton has arrived?” she asked, using Dockson’s fake name. He\nplayed the part of one of Renoux’s merchant contacts inside Luthadel.\n“Yes, my lady,” the servant said. “He’s in conference with Lord Renoux.”\nVin let the servant go. She could probably force her way into the\nconference, but it would look bad. Lady Valette had no reason to attend a\nmercantile meeting between Renoux and Delton.\nVin chewed her lower lip in thought. Sazed was always telling her she\nhad to keep up appearances. Fine, she thought. I’ll wait. Maybe Sazed can\ntell me what that crazy boy expects me to do with this handkerchief.\nShe sought out the upper library, maintaining a pleasant ladylike smile,\ninwardly trying to guess what Renoux and Dockson were talking about.\nDropping off the weapons was an excuse; Dockson wouldn’t have come\npersonally to do something so mundane. Perhaps Kelsier had been delayed.\nOr, maybe Dockson had finally gotten a communication from Marsh—\nKelsier’s brother, along with the other new obligator initiates, should be\narriving back in Luthadel soon.\nDockson and Renoux could have sent for me, she thought with\nannoyance. Valette often entertained guests with her uncle.\nShe shook her head. Even though Kelsier had named her a full member\nof the crew, the others obviously still regarded her as something of a child.\nThey were friendly and accepting, but they didn’t think to include her. It\nwas probably unintentional, but that didn’t make it any less frustrating.\nLight shone from the library ahead. Sure enough, Sazed sat inside,\ntranslating the last group of pages from the logbook. He looked up as Vin\nentered, smiling and nodding respectfully.\nNo spectacles this time either, Vin noted. Why did he wear them for that\nshort time before?\n“Mistress Vin,” he said, rising and fetching her a chair. “How are your\nstudies of the logbook going?”\nVin looked down at the loosely bound pages in her hand. “All right, I\nsuppose. I don’t see why I have to bother reading them—you gave copies to\nKell and Breeze too, didn’t you?”\n“Of course,” Sazed said, setting the chair down beside his desk.\n“However, Master Kelsier asked every member of the crew to read the"

        "text": "Kell and Breeze too, didn’t you?”\n“Of course,” Sazed said, setting the chair down beside his desk.\n“However, Master Kelsier asked every member of the crew to read the\npages. He is correct to do so, I think. The more eyes that read those words,\nthe more likely we will be to discover the secrets hidden within them.”\nVin sighed slightly, smoothing her dress and seating herself. The white\nand blue dress was beautiful—though intended for daily use, it was only\nslightly less luxurious than one of her ball gowns.\n“You must admit, Mistress,” Sazed said as he sat, “the text is amazing.\nThis work is a Keeper’s dream. Why, I’m discovering things about my\nculture that even I did not know!”\nVin nodded. “I just got to the part where they reach Terris.” Hopefully,\nthe next part will contain fewer supply lists. Honestly, for an evil god of\ndarkness, he certainly can be dull.\n“Yes, yes,” Sazed said, speaking with uncharacteristic enthusiasm. “Did\nyou see what he said, how he described Terris as a place of ‘green fertility’?\nKeeper legends speak of this. Terris is now a tundra of frozen dirt—why,\nalmost no plants can survive there. But, once it was green and beautiful,\nlike the text says.”\nGreen and beautiful, Vin thought. Why would green be beautiful? That\nwould be like having blue or purple plants—it would just be weird.\nHowever, there was something about the logbook that made her curious\n—something that both Sazed and Kelsier had been strangely closemouthed\nabout. “I just read the part where the Lord Ruler gets some Terris\npackmen,” Vin said carefully. “He talked about how they grow stronger\nduring the day because they let themselves be weak at night.”\nSazed suddenly grew more subdued. “Yes, indeed.”\n“You know something about this? Does it have to do with being a\nKeeper?”\n“It does,” Sazed said. “But, this should remain a secret, I think. Not that\nyou aren’t worthy of trust, Mistress Vin. However, if fewer people know\nabout Keepers, then fewer rumors will be told of us. It would be best if the\nLord Ruler began to believe that he had destroyed us completely, as has\nbeen his goal for the last thousand years.”\nVin shrugged. “Fine. Hopefully, none of the secrets Kelsier wants us to\ndiscover in this text are related to the Terrisman powers—if they are, I’ll\nmiss them completely.”\nSazed paused.\n“Ah, well,” Vin said nonchalantly, flipping through the pages she hadn’t\nread. “Looks like he spends a lot of time talking about the Terrismen. Guess\nI won’t be able to give much input when Kelsier gets back.”\n“You make a good point,” Sazed said slowly. “Even if you make it a bit\nmelodramatically.”\nVin smiled pertly.\n“Very well,” Sazed said with a sigh. “We should not have let you spend\nso much time with Master Breeze, I think.”\n“The men in the logbook,” Vin said. “They’re Keepers?”\nSazed nodded. “What we now call Keepers were far more common back\nthen—perhaps even more common than Mistings are among modern"

Our art is called ‘Feruchemy,’ and it grants the ability to store\ncertain physical attributes inside bits of metal.”\nVin frowned. “You burn metals too?”\n“No, Mistress,” Sazed said with a shake of his head. “Feruchemists aren’t\nlike Allomancers—we don’t ‘burn’ away our metals. We use them as\nstorage. Each piece of metal, dependent upon size and alloy, can store a\ncertain physical quality. The Feruchemist saves up an attribute, then draws\nupon that reserve at a later time.”\n“Attribute?” Vin asked. “Like strength?”\nSazed nodded. “In the text, the Terris packmen make themselves weaker\nduring the evening, storing up strength in their bracelets for use on the next\nday.”\nVin studied Sazed’s face. “That’s why you wear so many earrings!”\n“Yes, Mistress,” he said, reaching over to pull up his sleeves. Underneath\nhis robe, he wore thick iron bracers around his upper arms. “I keep some of\nmy reserves hidden—but wearing many rings, earrings, and other items of\njewelry has always been a part of Terris culture. The Lord Ruler once tried\nto enforce a ban upon Terrismen touching or owning any metal—in fact, he\ntried to make wearing metal a noble privilege, rather than a skaa one.”\nVin frowned. “That’s odd,” she said. “One would think that the nobility\nwouldn’t want to wear metal, because that would make them vulnerable to\nAllomancy.”\n“Indeed,” Sazed said. “However, it has long been imperial fashion to\naccent one’s wardrobe with metal. It began, I suspect, with the Lord Ruler’s\ndesire to deny the Terrismen the right to touch metal. He himself began\nwearing metal rings and bracelets, and the nobility always follows him in\nfashion. Nowadays, the most wealthy often wear metal as a symbol of\npower and pride.”\n“Sounds foolish,” Vin said.\n“Fashion often is, Mistress,” Sazed said. “Regardless, the ploy failed—\nmany of the nobility only wear wood painted to look like metal, and the\nTerris managed to weather the Lord Ruler’s discontent in this area. It was\nsimply too impractical to never let stewards handle metal. That hasn’t\nstopped the Lord Ruler from trying to exterminate the Keepers, however.”\n“He fears you.”\n“And hates us. Not just Feruchemists, but all Terrismen.” Sazed laid a\nhand on the still untranslated portion of the text. “I hope to find that secret\nin here as well. No one remembers why the Lord Ruler persecutes the Terris\npeople, but I suspect that it has something to do with those packmen—their\nleader, Rashek, appears to be a very contrary man. The Lord Ruler often\nspeaks of him in the narrative.”\n“He mentioned religion,” Vin said. “The Terris religion. Something about\nprophecies?”\nSazed shook his head. “I cannot answer that question, Mistress, for I\ndon’t know any more of the Terris religion than you do.”"

        "text": "prophecies?”\nSazed shook his head. “I cannot answer that question, Mistress, for I\ndon’t know any more of the Terris religion than you do.”\n“But, you collect religions,” Vin said. “You don’t know about your\nown?”\n“I do not,” Sazed said solemnly. “You see, Mistress, this was why the\nKeepers were formed. Centuries ago, my people hid away the last few\nTerris Feruchemists. The Lord Ruler’s purges of the Terris people were\ngrowing quite violent—this was before he began the breeding program.\nBack then, we weren’t stewards or servants—we weren’t even skaa. We\nwere something to be destroyed.\n“Yet, something kept the Lord Ruler from wiping us out completely. I\ndon’t know why—perhaps he thought genocide too kind a punishment.\nAnyway, he successfully destroyed our religion during the first two\ncenturies of his rule. The organization of Keepers was formed during the\nnext century, its members intent upon discovering that which had been lost,\nthen remembering for the future.”\n“With Feruchemy?”\nSazed nodded, rubbing his fingers across the bracer on his right arm.\n“This one is made of copper; it allows for the storage of memories and\nthoughts. Each Keeper carries several bracers like this, filled with\nknowledge—songs, stories, prayers, histories, and languages. Many\nKeepers have a particular area of interest—mine is religion—but we all\nremember the entire collection. If just one of us survives until the death of\nthe Lord Ruler, then the world’s people will be able to recover all that they\nhave lost.”\nHe paused, then pulled down his sleeve. “Well, not all that was lost.\nThere are still things we are missing.”\n“Your own religion,” Vin said quietly. “You never found it, did you?”\nSazed shook his head. “The Lord Ruler implies in this logbook that it\nwas our prophets that led him to the Well of Ascension, but even this is new\ninformation for us. What did we believe? What, or whom, did we worship?\nWhere did these Terris prophets come from, and how did they predict the\nfuture?”\n“I’m . . . sorry.”\n“We continue to look, Mistress. We will find our answers eventually, I\nthink. Even if we do not, we will still have provided an invaluable service\nfor mankind. Other people call us docile and servile, but we have fought\nhim, in our own way.”\nVin nodded. “So, what other things can you store? Strength and\nmemories. Anything else?”\nSazed eyed her. “I have said too much already, I think. You understand\nthe mechanics of what we do—if the Lord Ruler mentions these things in\nhis text, you will not be confused.”\n“Sight,” Vin said, perking up. “That’s why you wore glasses for a few\nweeks after you rescued me. You needed to be able to see better that night\nwhen you saved me, so you used up your storage. Then you spent a few\nweeks with weak vision so that you could refill it.”\nSazed didn’t respond to the comment. He picked up his pen, obviously\nintending to turn back to his translation. “Was there anything else,\nMistress?”\n“Yes, as a matter of fact,” Vin said, pulling the handkerchief from her"

You’ve spent far too long\naround Kelsier, Sazed.”\n“I know,” he said with a quiet sigh. “He has corrupted me, I think.\nRegardless, I do not understand your question. What is distinctive about\nthat particular handkerchief?”\n“That’s what I want to know,” Vin said. “Spook gave it to me just a little\nbit ago.”\n“Ah.

Is that boy\ncrazy?”\n“Most young men his age are somewhat crazy, I think,” Sazed said with a\nsmile. “However, this is hardly unexpected. Haven’t you noticed how he\nstares at you when you enter the room?”\n“I just thought he was creepy. What is he thinking? He’s so much\nyounger than me.”\n“The boy is fifteen, Mistress. That only makes him one year your junior.”\n“Two,” Vin said. “I turned seventeen last week.”\n“Still, he isn’t really that much younger than you.”\nVin rolled her eyes. “I don’t have time for his attentions.”\n“One would think, Mistress, that you would appreciate the opportunities\nyou have. Not everyone is so fortunate.”\nVin paused. He’s a eunuch, you fool. “Sazed, I’m sorry. I . . .”\nSazed waved a hand. “It is something I have never known enough of to\nmiss, Mistress. Perhaps I am fortunate—a life in the underground does not\nmake it easy to raise a family. Why, poor Master Hammond has been away\nfrom his wife for months.”\n“Ham’s married?”\n“Of course,” Sazed said. “So is Master Yeden, I believe. They protect\ntheir families by separating them from underground activities, but this\nnecessitates spending large periods of time apart.”\n“Who else?” Vin asked. “Breeze? Dockson?”\n“Master Breeze is a bit too . . . self-motivated for a family, I think.\nMaster Dockson hasn’t spoken of his romantic life, but I suspect that there\nis something painful in his past. That is not uncommon for plantation skaa,\nas you might expect.”\n“Dockson is from a plantation?” Vin asked with surprise.\n“Of course. Don’t you ever spend time talking with your friends,\nMistress?”\nFriends. I have friends. It was an odd realization.\n“Anyway,” Sazed said, “I should continue my work. I am sorry to be so\ndismissive, but I am nearly finished with the translation. . . .”\n“Of course,” Vin said, standing and smoothing her dress. “Thank you.”\nShe found Dockson sitting in the guest study, writing quietly on a piece of\npaper, a pile of documents organized neatly on the desktop.

He wore a\nstandard nobleman’s suit, and always looked more comfortable in the\nclothing than the others did. Kelsier was dashing, Breeze immaculate and\nlavish, but Dockson . . . he simply looked natural in the outfit.\nHe looked up as she entered. “Vin? I’m sorry—I should have sent for\nyou. For some reason I assumed you were out.”\n“I often am, these days,” she said, closing the door behind her. “I stayed\nhome today; listening to noblewomen prattle over their lunches can get a bit\nannoying.”\n“I can imagine,” Dockson said, smiling. “Have a seat.”\nVin nodded, strolling into the room. It was a quiet place, decorated in\nwarm colors and deep woods. It was still somewhat light outside, but\nDockson already had the evening drapes drawn and was working by\ncandlelight.\n“Any news from Kelsier?” Vin asked as she sat.\n“No,” Dockson said, setting aside his document. “But that’s not\nunexpected. He wasn’t going to stay at the caves for long, so sending a\nmessenger back would have been a bit silly—as an Allomancer, he might\neven be able to get back before a man on horseback. Either way, I suspect\nhe’ll be a few days late. This is Kell we’re talking about, after all.”\nVin nodded, then sat quietly for a moment. She hadn’t spent as much\ntime with Dockson as she had with Kelsier and Sazed—or even Ham and\nBreeze. He seemed like a kind man, however. Very stable, and very clever.\nWhile most of the others contributed some kind of Allomantic power to the\ncrew, Dockson was valuable because of his simple ability to organize.\nWhen something needed to be purchased—such as Vin’s dresses—\nDockson saw that it got done. When a building needed to be rented,\nsupplies procured, or a permit secured, Dockson made it happen. He wasn’t\nout front, scamming noblemen, fighting in the mists, or recruiting soldiers.\nWithout him, however, Vin suspected that the entire crew would fall apart.\nHe’s a nice man, she told herself. He won’t mind if I ask him. “Dox, what\nwas it like living on a plantation?”\n“Hmm? The plantation?”\nVin nodded. “You grew up on one, right? You’re a plantation skaa?”\n“Yes,” Dockson said. “Or, at least, I was. What was it like? I’m not sure\nhow to answer, Vin. It was a hard life, but most skaa live hard lives. I\nwasn’t allowed to leave the plantation—or even go outside of the hovel\ncommunity—without permission. We ate more regularly than a lot of the\nstreet skaa, but we were worked as hard as any millworker. Perhaps more.\n“The plantations are different from the cities. Out there, every lord is his\nown master. Technically, the Lord Ruler owns the skaa, but the noblemen\nrent them, and are allowed to kill as many as they want. Each lord just has\nto make certain that his crops come in.”\n“You seem so . . . unemotional about it,” Vin said."

Each lord just has\nto make certain that his crops come in.”\n“You seem so . . . unemotional about it,” Vin said.\nDockson shrugged. “It’s been a while since I lived there, Vin. I don’t\nknow that the plantation was overly traumatic. It was just life—we didn’t\nknow anything better. In fact, I now know that amongst plantation lords,\nmine was actually rather lenient.”\n“Why did you leave, then?”\nDockson paused. “An event,” he said his voice growing almost wistful.\n“You know that the law says that a lord can bed any skaa woman that he\nwishes?”\nVin nodded. “He just has to kill her when he’s done.”\n“Or soon thereafter,” Dockson said. “Quickly enough that she can’t birth\nany half-breed children.”\n“The lord took a woman you loved, then?”\nDockson nodded. “I don’t talk about it much. Not because I can’t, but\nbecause I think it would be pointless. I’m not the only skaa to lose a loved\none to a lord’s passion, or even to a lord’s indifference. In fact, I’ll bet\nyou’d have trouble finding a skaa who hasn’t had someone they love\nmurdered by the aristocracy. That’s just . . . the way it is.”\n“Who was she?” Vin asked.\n“A girl from the plantation. Like I said, my story isn’t that original. I\nremember . . . sneaking between the hovels at night to spend time with her.\nThe entire community played along, hiding us from the taskmasters—I\nwasn’t supposed to be out after dark, you see. I braved the mists for the first\ntime for her, and while many thought me foolish to go out at night, others\ngot over their superstition and encouraged me. I think the romance inspired\nthem; Kareien and I reminded everyone that there was something to live for.\n“When Kareien was taken by Lord Devinshae—her corpse returned the\nnext morning for burial—something just . . . died in the skaa hovels. I left\nthat next evening. I didn’t know there was a better life, but I just couldn’t\nstay, not with Kareien’s family there, not with Lord Devinshae watching us\nwork. . . .”\nDockson sighed, shaking his head. Vin could finally see some emotion in\nhis face. “You know,” he said, “it amazes me sometimes that we even try.\nWith everything they’ve done to us—the deaths, the tortures, the agonies—\nyou’d think that we would just give up on things like hope and love. But we\ndon’t. Skaa still fall in love. They still try to have families, and they still\nstruggle. I mean, here we are . . . fighting Kell’s insane little war, resisting a\ngod we know is just going to slaughter us all.”\nVin sat quietly, trying to comprehend the horror of what he described. “I .\n. . thought you said that your lord was a kind one.”\n“Oh, he was,” Dockson said. “Lord Devinshae rarely beat his skaa to\ndeath, and he only purged the elderly when the population got completely\nout of control.

But they aren’t\nmonsters, not all of them—not like your former plantation lord.”\nDockson shook his head. “You just aren’t seeing well enough, Vin. A\nnobleman can rape and murder a skaa woman one night, then be praised for\nhis morality and virtue the next day. Skaa just aren’t people to them.\nNoblewomen don’t even consider it cheating when their lord sleeps with a\nskaa woman.”\n“I . . .” Vin trailed off, growing uncertain. This was the one area of noble\nculture she hadn’t wanted to confront. Beatings, she could perhaps forgive,\nbut this . . .\nDockson shook his head. “You’re letting them dupe you, Vin. Things like\nthis are less visible in the cities because of whorehouses, but the murders\nstill happen. Some brothels use women of very poor—but noble—birth.\nMost, however, just kill off their skaa whores periodically to keep the\nInquisitors placated.”\nVin felt a little weak. “I . . . know about the brothels, Dox. My brother\nalways threatened to sell me to one. But, just because brothels exist doesn’t\nmean that all the men go to them. There are lots of workers who don’t visit\nthe skaa whorehouses.”\n“Noblemen are different, Vin,” Dockson said sternly. “They’re horrible\ncreatures. Why do you think I don’t complain when Kelsier kills them?\nWhy do you think I’m working with him to overthrow their government?\nYou should ask some of those pretty boys you dance with how often they’ve\nslept with a skaa woman they knew would be killed a short time later.\nThey’ve all done it, at one point or another.”\nVin looked down.\n“They can’t be redeemed, Vin,” Dockson said. He didn’t seem as\npassionate about the topic as Kelsier, he just seemed . . . resigned. “I don’t\nthink that Kell will be happy until they’re all dead. I doubt we have to go\nthat far—or even that we can—but I, for one, would be more than happy to\nsee their society collapse.”\nVin sat quietly. They can’t all be like that, she thought. They’re so"

They’re so\nbeautiful, so distinguished. Elend has never taken and murdered a skaa\nwoman . . . has he?\nI sleep but a few hours each night. We must press forward, traveling as much as we can each day—but when I finally lie down, I find sleep elusive. The same thoughts that\ntrouble me during the day are only compounded by the stillness of night.\nAnd, above it all, I hear the thumping sounds from above, the pulsings from the mountains. Drawing me closer with each beat.\n23\n“T of the Geffenry brothers were a retaliation for the murder\nHEY SAY THAT THE DEATHS\nof Lord Entrone,” Lady Kliss said quietly. Behind Vin’s group, the\nmusicians played upon their stage, but the evening was growing late, and\nfew people danced.\nLady Kliss’s circle of partygoers frowned at the news. There were about\nsix of them, including Vin and her companion—one Milen Davenpleu, a\nyoung heir to a minor house title.\n“Kliss, really,” Milen said. “Houses Geffenry and Tekiel are allies. Why\nwould Tekiel assassinate two Geffenry noblemen?”\n“Why indeed?” Kliss said, leaning forward conspiratorially, her massive\nblond bun wobbling slightly. Kliss had never displayed much fashion sense.\nShe was an excellent source of gossip, however.\n“You remember when Lord Entrone was found dead in the Tekiel\ngardens?” Kliss asked. “Well, it seemed obvious that one of House Tekiel’s\nenemies had killed him. But, House Geffenry has been petitioning Tekiel\nfor an alliance—apparently, a faction within the house thought that if\nsomething happened to enflame the Tekiels, they would be more willing to\nseek allies.”\n“You’re saying that Geffenry purposely killed a Tekiel ally?” asked Rene,\nKliss’s date. He scrunched up his ample brow in thought.\nKliss patted Rene’s arm. “Don’t worry about it too much, dear,” she\nadvised, then turned eagerly back to the conversation. “Don’t you see? By\nsecretly killing Lord Entrone, Geffenry hoped to get the allegiance it needs.\nThat would give it access to those Tekiel canal routes through the eastern\nplains.”\n“But it backfired,” Milen said thoughtfully. “Tekiel discovered the ruse,\nand killed Ardous and Callins.”\n“I danced with Ardous a couple of times at the last ball,” Vin said. Now\nhe’s dead, his corpse left on the streets outside a skaa slum.\n“Oh?” Milen asked. “Was he any good?”\nVin shrugged. “Not very.” That’s all you can ask, Milen? A man is dead,\nand you just want to know if I liked him more than you?\n“Well, now he’s dancing with the worms,” said Tyden, the final man in\nthe group.\nMilen gave the quip a pity laugh, which was more than it deserved.\nTyden’s attempts at humor generally left something to be desired.

He\nseemed like the type who would have been more at home with the ruffians\nof Camon’s crew than the noblemen of the dance hall.\nOf course, Dox says they’re all like that, underneath.\nVin’s conversation with Dockson still dominated her thoughts. When\nshe’d started coming to the noblemen’s balls back on that first night—the\nnight she’d nearly been killed—she’d thought about how fake everything\nseemed. How had she forgotten that original impression? How had she let\nherself get taken in, to begin admiring their poise and their splendor?\nNow, every nobleman’s arm around her waist made her cringe—as if she\ncould feel the rot within their hearts. How many skaa had Milen killed?\nWhat about Tyden? He seemed like the type who would enjoy a night with\nthe whores.\nBut, still she played along. She had finally worn her black gown this\nevening, somehow feeling the need to set herself apart from the other\nwomen with their bright colors and often brighter smiles. However, she\ncouldn’t avoid the others’ company; Vin had finally begun to gain the\nconfidences her crew needed. Kelsier would be delighted to know that his\nplan for House Tekiel was working, and that wasn’t the only thing she had\nbeen able to discover. She had dozens of little tidbits that would be of vital\nuse to the crew’s efforts.\nOne such tidbit was about House Venture. The family was bunkering up\nfor what it expected to be an extended house war; one evidence of this was\nthe fact that Elend attended far fewer balls than he once had. Not that Vin\nminded. When he did come, he generally avoided her, and she didn’t really\nwant to talk to him anyway. Memories of what Dockson had said made her\nthink that she might have trouble remaining civil toward Elend.\n“Milen?” Lord Rene asked. “Are you still planning on joining us for a\ngame of shelldry tomorrow?”\n“Of course, Rene,” Milen said.\n“Didn’t you promise that last time?” Tyden asked.\n“I’ll be there,” Milen said. “Something came up last time.”\n“And it won’t come up again?” Tyden asked. “You know we can’t play\nunless we have a fourth man. If you’re not going to be there, we could ask\nsomeone else. . . .”\nMilen sighed, then held up a hand, sharply gesturing to the side. The\nmotion caught Vin’s attention—she had only been half listening to the\nconversation. She looked to the side, and nearly jumped in shock as she saw\nan obligator approaching the group.\nSo far she’d managed to avoid obligators at the balls. After her first run-\nin with a high prelan, some months ago—and the subsequent alerting of an\nInquisitor—she’d been apprehensive to even go near one.\nThe obligator approached, smiling in a creepy sort of way. Perhaps it was\nthe arms clasped before him, hands hidden inside the gray sleeves. Perhaps\nit was the tattoos around the eyes, wrinkled with the aging skin.

This wasn’t just a nobleman, this was an obligator—eyes of the\nLord Ruler, enforcer of His law.\nThe obligator stopped at the group. His tattoos marked him as a member\nof the Canton of Orthodoxy, the primary bureaucratic arm of the Ministry.\nHe eyed the group, speaking in a smooth voice. “Yes?”\nMilen pulled out a few coins. “I promise to meet these two for shelldry\ntomorrow,” he said, handing the coins to the aging obligator.\nIt seemed like such a silly reason to call over an obligator—or, at least, so\nVin thought. The obligator, however, didn’t laugh or point out the frivolity\nof the demand. He simply smiled, palming the coins as deftly as any thief.\n“I witness this, Lord Milen,” he said.\n“Satisfied?” Milen asked of the other two.\nThey nodded.\nThe obligator turned, not giving Vin a second glance, and strolled away.\nShe released a quiet breath, watching his shuffing form.\nThey must know everything that happens in court, she realized. If nobility\ncall them over to witness things this simple . . . The more she knew about\nthe Ministry, the more she realized how clever the Lord Ruler had been in\norganizing them. They witnessed every mercantile contract; Dockson and\nRenoux had to deal with obligators nearly every day. Only they could\nauthorize weddings, divorces, land purchases, or ratify inheritance of titles.\nIf an obligator hadn’t witnessed an event, it hadn’t happened, and if one\nhadn’t sealed a document, then it might as well not have been written.\nVin shook her head as the conversation turned to other topics. It had been\na long night, and her mind was full of information to scribble down on her\nway back to Fellise.\n“Excuse me, Lord Milen,” she said, laying a hand on his arm—though\ntouching him made her shiver slightly. “I think perhaps it is time for me to\nretire.”\n“I’ll walk you to your carriage,” he said.\n“That won’t be necessary,” she said sweetly. “I want to refresh myself,\nand then I have to wait for my Terrisman anyway. I’ll just go sit down at our\ntable.”\n“Very well,” he said, nodding respectfully.\n“Go if you must, Valette,” Kliss said. “But you’ll never know the news I\nhave about the Ministry. . . .”\nVin paused. “What news?”\nKliss’s eyes twinkled, and she glanced at the disappearing obligator. “The\nInquisitors are buzzing like insects. They’ve hit twice as many skaa thieving\nbands these last few months as usual. They don’t even take prisoners for\nexecutions—they just leave them all dead.”\n“How do you know this?” Milen asked skeptically. He seemed so\nstraight-backed and noble. You would never know what he really was.\n“I have my sources,” Kliss said with a smile. “Why, the Inquisitors found\nanother band just this afternoon.

Dockson and the rest are too clever. Even without Kelsier\nin town, they’ll be safe.\n“Cursed thieves,” Tyden spat. “Damn skaa don’t know their place. Isn’t\nthe food and clothing we give enough of a theft from our pockets?”\n“It’s amazing the creatures can even survive as thieves,” said Carlee,\nTyden’s young wife, in her normal purring voice. “I can’t imagine what\nkind of incompetent would let himself get robbed by skaa.”\nTyden flushed, and Vin eyed him with curiosity. Carlee rarely spoke\nexcept to make some jab against her husband.\nHe must have been robbed himself. A scam, perhaps?\nFiling away the information for later investigation, Vin turned to go—a\nmotion that put her face-to-face with a newcomer to the group: Shan\nElariel.\nElend’s former betrothed was immaculate, as always. Her long auburn\nhair had an almost luminous sheen, and her beautiful figure only reminded\nVin how scrawny she herself was. Self-important in a way that could make\neven a confident person uncertain, Shan was—as Vin was beginning to\nrealize—exactly what most of the aristocracy thought was the perfect\nwoman.\nThe men in Vin’s group nodded their heads in respect, and the women\ncurtsied, honored to have their conversation joined by one so important. Vin\nglanced to the side, trying to escape, but Shan was standing right before her.\nShan smiled. “Ah, Lord Milen,” she said to Vin’s companion, “it’s a pity\nthat your original date this evening took sick. It appears you were left with\nfew other options.”\nMilen flushed, Shan’s comment expertly placing him in a difficult\nposition. Did he defend Vin, possibly earning the ire of a very powerful\nwoman? Or, did he instead agree with Shan, thereby insulting his date?\nHe took the coward’s way out: He ignored the comment. “Lady Shan, it\nis a pleasure to have you join us.”\n“Indeed,” Shan said smoothly, eyes glittering with pleasure as she\nregarded Vin’s discomfort.\nCursed woman! Vin thought. It seemed that whenever Shan grew bored,\nshe would seek out Vin and embarrass her for sport.\n“However,” Shan said, “I am afraid I didn’t come to chat. Unpleasant\nthough it may be, I have business with the Renoux child. Will you excuse\nus?”\n“Of course, my lady,” Milen said, backing away. “Lady Valette, thank\nyou for your company this evening.”\nVin nodded to him and the others, feeling a little like a wounded animal\nbeing abandoned by the herd. She really didn’t want to deal with Shan this\nevening.\n“Lady Shan,” Vin said once they were alone. “I think your interest in me\nis unfounded. I haven’t really been spending much time with Elend lately.”\n“I know,” Shan said. “It appears I overestimated your competence, child.\nOne would think that once you’d gained favor with a man so much more\nimportant than yourself, you wouldn’t have let him slip away so easily.”\nShouldn’t she be jealous?

Vin thought, suppressing a cringe as she felt\nthe inevitable touch of Shan’s Allomancy on her emotions. Shouldn’t she\nhate me for taking her place?\nBut, that wasn’t the noble way. Vin was nothing—a momentary\ndiversion. Shan wasn’t interested in recapturing Elend’s affection; she just\nwanted a way to strike back at the man who had slighted her.\n“A wise girl would put herself in a position where she could make use of\nthe only advantage she has,” Shan said. “If you think any other important\nnobleman will ever pay any attention to you, then you are mistaken. Elend\nlikes to shock the court—and so, naturally, he chose to do so with the most\nhomely and lumpish woman he could find. Take this opportunity; you shall\nnot soon find another.”\nVin gritted her teeth against the insults and the Allomancy; Shan had\nobviously made an art out of forcing people to take whatever abuse she\nsought fit to deliver.\n“Now,” Shan said, “I require information regarding certain texts Elend\nhas in his possession. You can read, can’t you?”\nVin nodded curtly.\n“Good,” Shan said. “All you need to do is memorize the titles of his\nbooks—don’t look on the outside covers, they can be misleading. Read the\nfirst few pages, then report back to me.”\n“And if I should instead tell Elend what you’re planning?”\nShan laughed. “My dear, you don’t know what I’m planning. Besides,\nyou seem to be making some headway in court. Surely you realize that\nbetraying me is not something you want to even contemplate.”\nWith that, Shan walked off, immediately gathering a collection of\nhangers-on from the surrounding nobility. Shan’s Soothing weakened, and\nVin felt her frustration and anger rise. There had been a time when she\nwould have simply scampered away, ego already too beaten down to be\nbothered by Shan’s insults. This night, however, she found herself wishing\nfor a way to strike back.\nCalm yourself. This is a good thing. You’ve become a pawn in Great\nHouse plans—most lesser nobility probably dream of such an opportunity.\nShe sighed, retreating toward the now empty table she had shared with\nMilen. The ball this evening was being held at the marvelous Keep Hasting.\nIts tall, round central keep was attended by six auxiliary towers, each set off\nfrom the main building a short distance and connected to it by walltop\nwalkways. All seven towers were set with winding, curving patterns of\nstained glass.\nThe ballroom was at the top of the wide central tower. Fortunately, a\nsystem of skaa-powered pulley platforms kept noble guests from having to\nwalk all the way to the top. The ballroom itself wasn’t as spectacular as\nsome Vin had visited—just a squarish chamber with vaulted ceilings and\ncolored glass running around the perimeter.\nFunny, how easily one can become jaded, Vin thought. Perhaps that’s\nhow the noblemen can do such terrible things. They’ve been killing for so\nlong that it doesn’t unsettle them anymore."

I\nwish Kelsier would hurry up and get back, she thought. The crew, Vin\nincluded, seemed less motivated without him around. It wasn’t that she\ndidn’t want to work; Kelsier’s snappy wit and optimism just helped keep\nher moving.\nVin looked up idly, and her eyes caught sight of Elend Venture standing\njust a short distance away, chatting with a small group of young noblemen.\nShe froze. Part of her—the Vin part—wanted to scurry away and hide.\nShe’d fit beneath a table, dress and all.\nOddly, however, she found her Valette side stronger. I have to talk to him,\nshe thought. Not because of Shan, but because I have to find out the truth.\nDockson was exaggerating. He had to be.\nWhen had she grown so confrontational? Even as she stood, Vin was\namazed at her firm resolve. She crossed the ballroom—checking her black\ndress briefly as she walked. One of Elend’s companions tapped him on the\nshoulder, nodding toward Vin. Elend turned, and the other two men\nwithdrew.\n“Why, Valette,” he said as she paused in front of him. “I arrived late. I\ndidn’t even know you were here.”\nLiar. Of course you knew. Valette wouldn’t miss the Hasting Ball. How to\nbroach it? How to ask? “You’ve been avoiding me,” she said.\n“Now, I wouldn’t say that. I’ve just been busy. House issues, you know.\nBesides, I warned you that I was rude, and . . .” he trailed off. “Valette? Is\neverything all right?”\nVin realized she was sniffling slightly, and she felt a tear on her cheek.\nIdiot! she thought, dabbing her eyes with Lestibournes’s handkerchief.\nYou’ll ruin your makeup!\n“Valette, you’re shaking!” Elend said with concern. “Here, let’s go to the\nbalcony and get you some fresh air.”\nShe let him lead her away from the sounds of music and chattering\npeople, and they stepped into the quiet, dark air. The balcony—one of many\njutting from the top of the central Hasting tower—was empty. A single\nstone lantern stood as part of the railing, and some tastefully placed plants\nlined the corners.\nMist floated in the air, prevalent as ever, though the balcony was close\nenough to the keep’s warmth that the mist was weak. Elend didn’t pay any\nattention to it. He, like most noblemen, considered fear of the mist to be a\nfoolish skaa superstition—which, Vin supposed, was right.\n“Now, what is this about?” Elend asked. “I’ll admit, I have been ignoring\nyou. I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve it, I just . . . well, it seemed like you were\nfitting in so well that you didn’t need a troublemaker like me being—”\n“Have you ever slept with a skaa woman?” Vin asked."

He was right,\nyou’re all monsters.”\n“I . . .” He laid a hand on Vin’s arm, but she pulled it away, only to feel a\nteardrop drip down her face and stain her dress. She reached up, wiping her\neyes, the handkerchief coming back colored with makeup.\n“It happened when I was thirteen,” Elend said quietly. “My father\nthought it was time that I became ‘a man.’ I didn’t even know they were\ngoing to kill the girl afterward, Valette. Honestly, I didn’t.”\n“And after that?” she demanded, growing angry. “How many girls have\nyou murdered, Elend Venture?”\n“None! Never again, Valette. Not after I found out what had happened\nthat first time.”\n“You expect me to believe you?”\n“I don’t know,” Elend said. “Look, I know that it’s fashionable for the\nwomen of court to label all men brutes, but you have to believe me. We’re\nnot all like that.”\n“I was told that you are,” Vin said.\n“By whom? Country nobility? Valette, they don’t know us. They’re\njealous because we control most of the canal systems—and they might just\nhave a right to be. Their envy doesn’t make us terrible people, however.”\n“What percentage?” Vin asked. “How many noblemen do these things?”\n“Maybe a third,” Elend said. “I’m not sure. They aren’t the types I spend\nmy time with.”\nShe wanted to believe him, and that desire should have made her more\nskeptical. But, looking into those eyes—eyes she had always found so\nhonest—she found herself swayed. For the first time she could remember,\nshe completely pushed aside Reen’s whispers, and simply believed.\n“A third,” she whispered. So many. But, that’s better than all of them. She\nreached up to dab her eyes, and Elend eyed her handkerchief.\n“Who gave you that?” he asked curiously.\n“A suitor,” Vin said.\n“Is he the one who’s been telling you these things about me?”\n“No, that was another,” Vin said. “He . . . said that all noblemen—or,\nrather, all Luthadel noblemen—were terrible people. He said that court\nwomen don’t even consider it cheating when their men sleep with skaa\nwhores.”\nElend snorted. “Your informant doesn’t know women very well, then. I\ndare you to find me one lady who isn’t bothered when her husband dallies\nwith another—skaa or noble.”\nVin nodded, taking a deep breath, calming herself. She felt ridiculous . . .\nbut she also felt at peace. Elend knelt beside her chair, still obviously\nconcerned.\n“So,” she said, “your father is one of the third?”"

He\nsat down, elbow resting against the railing, running his hand through his\nmessy hair. “Well,” he noted, “you probably aren’t the first lady I’ve made\ncry at a ball, but you are the first one I’ve made cry that I sincerely care\nabout.

You can afford to ignore politics—some of us\naren’t so fortunate.”\n“I suppose.”\n“Besides,” Vin said, “you play politics just as well as the rest.

He lost someone, a woman he loved, to a nobleman\nwho wanted a pretty thing for the evening’s entertainment.”\n“At your plantation?”\nVin shook her head quickly. “He ran away and came to my father’s\nlands.”\n“And you hid him?” Elend asked with surprise. “Runaway skaa are\nsupposed to be executed!”\n“I kept his secret,” Vin said. “I didn’t know him for very long, but . . .\nwell, I can promise you this, Elend: His love was as strong as that of any\nnobleman. Stronger than most of them here in Luthadel, certainly.”\n“And intelligence?” Elend asked eagerly. “Did they seem . . . slow?”\n“Of course not,” Vin snapped. “I should think, Elend Venture, that I knew\nseveral skaa more clever than yourself. They may not have education, but\nthey’re still intelligent. And they’re angry.”\n“Angry?” he asked.\n“Some of them,” Vin said. “About the way they’re treated.”\n“They know, then? About the disparities between us and them?”\n“How could they not?” Vin said, reaching up to wipe her nose with the\nhandkerchief. She paused, however, noting just how much makeup she had\nrubbed across it.\n“Here,” Elend said, handing her his own handkerchief. “Tell me more.\nHow do you know these things?”\n“They told me,” Vin said. “They trusted me. I know that they’re angry\nbecause they would complain about their lives. I know they’re intelligent\nbecause of the things they keep hidden from the nobility.”\n“Like what?”\n“Like, the underground movement network,” Vin said. “Skaa help\nrunaways travel the canals from plantation to plantation. The noblemen\ndon’t notice because they never pay attention to skaa faces.”\n“Interesting.”"

The noblemen\ndon’t notice because they never pay attention to skaa faces.”\n“Interesting.”\n“Plus,” Vin said, “there are the thieving crews. I figure that those skaa\nmust be fairly clever if they’re able to hide from the obligators and the\nnobility, stealing from the Great Houses right beneath the Lord Ruler’s\nnose.”\n“Yes, I know,” Elend said. “I wish I could meet one of them, to ask them\nhow they hide so well. They must be fascinating people.”\nVin almost spoke further, but she held her tongue. I’ve probably said too\nmuch already.\nElend looked over at her. “You’re fascinating too, Valette. I should have\nknown better than to assume you’d been corrupted by the rest of them.\nPerhaps you’ll be able to corrupt them instead.”\nVin smiled.\n“But,” Elend said, rising. “I need to be leaving. I actually came to the\nparty tonight for a specific purpose—some friends of mine are meeting\ntogether.”\nThat’s right! Vin thought. One of the men Elend met with before—the\nones that Kelsier and Sazed thought it was strange that he would associate\nwith—was a Hasting.\nVin stood as well, handing Elend back his handkerchief.\nHe didn’t take it. “You might want to keep that. It wasn’t intended to be\nsimply functional.”\nVin looked down at the handkerchief. When a nobleman wants to court a\nlady seriously, he gives her a handkerchief.\n“Oh!” she said, pulling the handkerchief back. “Thank you.”\nElend smiled, stepping close to her. “That other man, whoever he is,\nmight have a lead on me because of my foolishness. However, I am not so\nfoolish that I would pass up the chance to give him a little competition.” He\nwinked, bowed slightly, and walked back toward the central ballroom.\nVin waited a moment, then walked forward and slipped through the\nbalcony doorway. Elend met up with the same two as before—a Lekal and a\nHasting, political enemies of the Venture. They paused for a moment, then\nall three walked toward a stairwell at the side of the room.\nThose stairwells only lead to one place, Vin thought, slipping back into\nthe room. The auxiliary towers.\n“Mistress Valette?”\nVin jumped, turning to find Sazed approaching. “Are we ready to go?” he\nasked.\nVin moved over to him quickly. “Lord Elend Venture just disappeared\ndown that stairwell with his Hasting and Lekal friends.”\n“Interesting,” Sazed said. “And why would . . . Mistress, what happened\nto your makeup!”\n“Never mind,” Vin said. “I think I should follow them.”\n“Is that another handkerchief, Mistress?” Sazed asked. “You have been\nbusy.”\n“Sazed, are you listening to me?”\n“Yes, Mistress. I suppose you could follow them if you wish, but you\nwould be fairly obvious. I don’t know that it would be the best method of\ngaining information.”\n“I wouldn’t follow them overtly,” Vin said quietly. “I’d use Allomancy."

I don’t know that it would be the best method of\ngaining information.”\n“I wouldn’t follow them overtly,” Vin said quietly. “I’d use Allomancy.\nBut, I need your permission for that.”\nSazed paused. “I see. How is your side?”\n“It’s been healed for ages,” Vin said. “I don’t even notice it anymore.”\nSazed sighed. “Very well. Master Kelsier intended to begin your training\nin earnest again when he returned, anyway. Just . . . be careful. This is a\nridiculous thing to say to a Mistborn, I think, but I ask anyway.”\n“I will,” Vin said. “I’ll meet you on that balcony over there in an hour.”\n“Good luck, Mistress,” Sazed said.\nVin was already rushing back toward the balcony. She stepped around the\ncorner, then stood before the stone railing and the mists beyond. The\nbeautiful, swirling void. It’s been far too long, she thought, reaching into\nher sleeve and pulling out a vial of metals. She downed it eagerly and got\nout a small handful of coins.\nThen, blissfully, she hopped up onto the railing and threw herself out into\nthe dark mists.\nTin gave her sight as the wind flapped at her dress. Pewter gave her\nstrength as she turned her eyes toward the buttresslike wall running between\nthe tower and the main keep. Steel gave her power as she threw a coin\ndownward, sending it into the darkness.\nShe lurched in the air. The air resistance fluttered her dress, and she felt\nlike she was trying to pull a bale of cloth behind her, but her Allomancy was\nstrong enough to deal with that. Elend’s tower was the next one over; she\nneeded to get onto the walltop walkway that ran between it and the central\ntower. Vin flared steel, Pushing herself up a bit higher, then flung another\ncoin into the mists behind her. When it hit the wall, she used it to shoot\nherself forward.\nShe slammed into her target wall just a bit too low—folds of cloth\ncushioning the blow—but she managed to grab the lip of the walkway\nabove. An unenhanced Vin would have had trouble pulling herself up onto\nthe wall, but Vin the Allomancer easily scrambled over the side.\nShe crouched in her black dress, moving quietly across the walltop\npathway. There were no guards, but the tower ahead of her had a lit\nsentrypost at its base.\nCan’t go that way, she thought, glancing upward instead. The tower\nappeared to have several rooms, and a couple of them were lit. Vin dropped\na coin and catapulted herself upward, then Pulled against a window\nmounting and yanked herself over to land lightly on the stone window\nledge. The shutters were closed against the night, and she had to lean close,\nflaring tin, to hear what was going on inside.\n“. . . balls always last well into the night. We’ll probably have to pull\ndouble duty.”\nGuards, Vin thought, jumping and Pushing against the top of the window.\nIt rattled as she shot up the side of the tower. She caught the base of the\nnext window ledge and pulled herself up."

Elend.\n“She happens to be far more attractive than you are, Telden.”\nA masculine voice laughed. “The mighty Elend Venture, finally captured\nby a pretty face.”\n“She’s more than that, Jastes,” Elend said. “She’s kindhearted—she\nhelped skaa runaways on her plantation. I think we should bring her in to\ntalk with us.”\n“Not a chance,” said a deep-voiced man. “Look, Elend, I don’t mind if\nyou want to talk philosophy. Hell, I’ll even share a few drinks with you\nwhen you do. But I’m not going to let random people come join us.”\n“I agree with Telden,” Jastes said. “Five people is enough.”\n“See, now,” Elend’s voice said. “I don’t think you’re being fair.”\n“Elend . . .” another voice said sufferingly.\n“All right,” Elend said. “Telden, did you read the book I gave you?”\n“I tried,” Telden said. “It’s a bit thick.”\n“But it’s good, right?” Elend said.\n“Good enough,” Telden said. “I can see why the Lord Ruler hates it so\nmuch.”\n“Redalevin’s works are better,” Jastes said. “More concise.”\n“I don’t mean to be contrary,” said a fifth voice. “But, is this all we’re\ngoing to do? Read?”\n“What’s wrong with reading?” Elend asked.\n“It’s a bit boring,” the fifth voice said.\nGood man, Vin thought.\n“Boring?” Elend asked. “Gentlemen, these ideas—these words—they’re\neverything. These men knew that they’d be executed for their words. Can\nyou not sense their passion?”\n“Passion, yes,” the fifth voice said. “Usefulness, no.”\n“We can change the world,” Jastes said. “Two of us are house heirs, the\nother three are second heirs.”\n“Someday, we’ll be the ones in charge,” Elend said. “If we put these\nideas into effect—fairness, diplomacy, moderation—we can exert pressure\neven on the Lord Ruler!”\nThe fifth voice snorted. “You might be heir to a powerful house, Elend,\nbut the rest of us aren’t as important. Telden and Jastes will probably never\ninherit, and Kevoux—no offense—is hardly that influential. We can’t\nchange the world.”\n“We can change the way our houses work,” Elend said. “If the houses\nwould stop squabbling, we might be able to gain some real power in the\ngovernment—rather than just bow to the whims of the Lord Ruler.”\n“Every year, the nobility grows weaker,” Jastes said in agreement. “Our\nskaa belong to the Lord Ruler, as does our land.

This is no way to live.”\n“I agree with you there,” Telden said. “Elend’s prattling about class\nimbalance seems like silliness to me, but I can see the importance of\npresenting a unified front before the Lord Ruler.”\n“Exactly,” Elend said. “This is what we have to—”\n“Vin!” a voice whispered.\nVin jumped, nearly falling off the window ledge in shock. She glanced\naround in alarm.\n“Above you,” the voice whispered.\nShe glanced up. Kelsier hung from another window ledge just above. He\nsmiled, winked, then nodded down toward the wall-walkway below.\nVin glanced back at Elend’s room as Kelsier dropped through the mists\nbeside her. Finally, she pushed herself off and followed Kelsier down, using\nher same coin to slow her descent.\n“You’re back!” she said eagerly as she landed.\n“Got back this afternoon.”\n“What are you doing here?”\n“Checking up on our friend in there,” Kelsier said. “Doesn’t seem like\nmuch has changed since the last time.”\n“Last time?”\nKelsier nodded. “I’ve spied on that little group a couple of times since\nyou told me about them. I shouldn’t have bothered—they’re not a threat.\nJust a bunch of noblelings getting together to drink and debate.”\n“But, they want to overthrow the Lord Ruler!”\n“Hardly,” Kelsier said with a snort. “They’re just doing what noblemen\ndo—planning alliances. It’s not that unusual for the next generation to start\norganizing their house coalitions before they come to power.”\n“This is different,” Vin said.\n“Oh?” Kelsier asked with amusement. “You’ve been a noble so long that\nyou can tell that already?”\nShe flushed, and he laughed, putting a friendly arm around her shoulders.\n“Oh, don’t get like that. They seem like nice enough lads, for noblemen. I\npromise not to kill any of them, all right?”\nVin nodded.\n“Perhaps we can find a way to use them—they do seem more open-\nminded than most. I just don’t want you to be disappointed, Vin. They’re\nstill noblemen. Perhaps they can’t help what they are, but that doesn’t\nchange their nature.”\nJust like Dockson, Vin thought. Kelsier assumes the worst about Elend.\nBut, did she really have any reason to expect otherwise? To fight a battle\nlike Kelsier and Dockson were, it was probably more effective—and better\nfor the psyche—to assume that all of their enemies were evil.\n“What happened to your makeup, by the way?” Kelsier asked.\n“I don’t want to talk about it,” Vin said, thinking back to her conversation\nwith Elend. Why did I have to cry? I’m such an idiot! And, the way I blurted\nout that question about him sleeping with skaa.\nKelsier shrugged. “Okay, then. We should get going—I doubt young\nVenture and his comrades will discuss anything relevant.”\nVin paused.\n“I’ve listened to them on three separate occasions, Vin,” Kelsier said."

I’ll meet you back at Clubs’s shop—have the carriage drop you and\nSazed off there, then continue on out of the city. That’ll keep up\nappearances.”\nVin nodded again, and Kelsier winked and jumped off the wall into the\nmists.\nIn the end, I must trust in myself. I have seen men who have beaten from themselves the ability to recognize truth and goodness, and I do not think I am one of them. I can\nstill see the tears in a young child’s eyes and feel pain at his suffering.\nIf I ever lose this, then I will know that I’ve passed beyond hope of redemption.\n24\nK shop when Vin and Sazed arrived. He sat with Ham,\nELSIER WAS ALREADY AT THE\nClubs, and Spook in the kitchen, enjoying a late-night drink.\n“Ham!” Vin said eagerly as she came in the back door. “You’re back!”\n“Yup,” he said happily, raising his cup.\n“It seems like you’ve been gone forever!”\n“You’re telling me,” Ham said, his voice earnest.\nKelsier chuckled, rising to refill his drink. “Ham’s a bit tired of playing\ngeneral.”\n“I had to wear a uniform,” Ham complained, stretching. He now wore his\ncustomary vest and trousers. “Even plantation skaa don’t have to deal with\nthat kind of torture.”\n“Try wearing a formal gown sometime,” Vin said, seating herself. She’d\nbrushed off the front of her dress, and it didn’t look half as bad as she’d\nfeared. The blackish gray ash still showed up a bit against the dark fabric,\nand the fibers were rough where she’d rubbed against stone, but both were\nbarely noticeable.\nHam laughed. “It seems that you’ve turned into a proper young lady\nwhile I was gone.”\n“Hardly,” Vin said as Kelsier handed her a cup of wine. She paused\nbriefly, then took a sip.\n“Mistress Vin is being modest, Master Hammond,” Sazed said, taking a\nseat. “She’s growing quite proficient at courtly arts—better than many\nactual nobles that I have known.”\nVin flushed, and Ham laughed again. “Humility, Vin? Where’d you ever\nlearn a bad habit like that?”\n“Not from me, certainly,” Kelsier said, offering Sazed a cup of wine. The\nTerrisman raised his hand in a respectful refusal.\n“Of course she didn’t get it from you, Kell,” Ham said. “Maybe Spook\ntaught her. He seems to be the only one in this crew who knows how to\nkeep his mouth shut, eh, kid?”"

And no one sent for me?”\n“You seemed busy,” Kelsier said.\n“Besides,” Ham added, “we know you’re too responsible to sit around\nand get drunk with a bunch of miscreants like us.”\n“Someone has to keep this crew running,” Dockson said lightheartedly,\npouring himself a drink. He paused, frowning at Ham. “That vest looks\nfamiliar. . . .”\nHam smiled. “I ripped the arms off of my uniform coat.”\n“You didn’t!” Vin said with a smile.\nHam nodded, looking self-satisfied.\nDockson sighed, continuing to fill his cup. “Ham, those things cost\nmoney.”\n“Everything costs money,” Ham said. “But, what is money? A physical\nrepresentation of the abstract concept of effort. Well, wearing that uniform\nfor so long was a pretty mean effort. I’d say that this vest and I are even\nnow.”\nDockson just rolled his eyes. In the main room, the shop’s front door\nopened and closed, and Vin heard Breeze bid hello to the apprentice on\nwatch.\n“By the way, Dox,” Kelsier said, leaning with his back against a\ncupboard. “I’m going to need a few ‘physical representations of the concept\nof effort’ myself. I’d like to rent a small warehouse to conduct some of my\ninformant meetings.”\n“That can probably be arranged,” Dockson said. “Assuming we keep\nVin’s wardrobe budget under control, I—” He broke off, glancing at Vin.\n“What did you do to that gown, young lady!”\nVin flushed, scrunching down in her chair. Perhaps it’s a bit more\nnoticeable than I thought. . . .\nKelsier chuckled. “You may have to get used to dirtied clothing, Dox.\nVin’s back on Mistborn duty as of this evening.”\n“Interesting,” Breeze said, entering the kitchen. “Might I suggest that she\navoid fighting three Steel Inquisitors at once this time?”\n“I’ll do my best,” Vin said.\nBreeze strolled over to the table and chose a seat with his characteristic\ndecorum. The portly man raised his dueling cane, pointing it at Ham. “I see\nthat my period of intellectual respite has come to an end.”\nHam smiled. “I thought up a couple beastly questions while I was gone,\nand I’ve been saving them just for you, Breeze.”\n“I’m dying of anticipation,” Breeze said. He turned his cane toward\nLestibournes. “Spook, drink.”\nSpook rushed over and fetched Breeze a cup of wine.\n“He’s such a fine lad,” Breeze noted, accepting the drink. “I barely even\nhave to nudge him Allomantically.

Then, with a perfectly straight face, he said, “Wasing\nnot of wasing is.”\nBreeze sat, dumbfounded, and the room burst into laughter. Breeze rolled\nhis eyes indignantly, shaking his head and muttering about the crew’s gross\nchildishness.\nVin nearly choked on her wine as she laughed. “What did you even say?”\nshe asked of Dockson as he sat down beside her.\n“I’m not sure,” he confessed. “It just sounded right.”\n“I don’t think you said anything, Dox,” Kelsier said.\n“Oh, he said something,” Spook said. “It just didn’t mean anything.”\nKelsier laughed. “That’s true pretty much all the time. I’ve found you can\nignore half of what Dox tells you and not miss much—except for maybe the\noccasional complaint that you’re spending too much.”\n“Hey!” Dockson said. “Once again, must I point out that someone has to\nbe responsible? Honestly, the way you people go through boxings . . .”\nVin smiled. Even Dockson’s complaints seemed good-natured. Clubs sat\nquietly by the side wall, looking as curmudgeonly as ever, but Vin caught\nsight of a slight smile on his lips. Kelsier rose and opened another bottle of\nwine, refilling cups as he told the crew about the skaa army’s preparations.\nVin felt . . . contented. As she sipped at her wine, she caught sight of the\nopen doorway leading into the darkened workshop. She imagined, just for a\nmoment, that she could see a figure out in the shadows—a frightened wisp\nof a girl, untrusting, suspicious. The girl’s hair was ragged and short, and\nshe wore a simple, untucked dirty shirt and a pair of brown trousers.\nVin remembered that second night in Clubs’s shop, when she had stood\nout in the dark workroom, watching the others share late-night\nconversation. Had she really been that girl—one who would hide in the cold\ndarkness, watching the laughter and friendship with a hidden envy, but\nnever daring to join it?\nKelsier made some particularly witty comment, drawing laughter from\nthe entire room."

But . . . she could finally understand, at least a little bit, why he\nworked the way he did.\n“All right,” Kelsier said, pulling over a chair and sitting on it the wrong\nway. “It looks like the army will be ready on schedule, and Marsh is in\nplace. We need to get this plan moving. Vin, news from the ball?”\n“House Tekiel is vulnerable,” she said. “Its allies are scattering, and the\nvultures are moving in. Some whisper that debts and lost business will force\nthe Tekiel to sell off their keep by the end of the month. There’s no way\nthey can afford to continue paying the Lord Ruler’s keep tax.”\n“Which effectively eliminates one entire Great House from the city,”\nDockson said. “Most of the Tekiel nobility—including Mistings and\nMistborn—will have to move to outer plantations to try and recoup losses.”\n“Nice,” Ham noted. Any noble houses they could frighten out of the city\nwould make seizing it that much easier.\n“That still leaves nine Great Houses in the city,” Breeze noted.\n“But they’ve started killing each other at night,” Kelsier said. “That’s\nonly one step away from open war. I suspect we’ll see an exodus start here\npretty soon—anyone who isn’t willing to risk assassination to maintain\ndominance in Luthadel will leave town for a couple of years.”\n“The strong houses don’t seem very afraid, though,” Vin said. “They’re\nstill throwing balls, anyway.”\n“Oh, they’ll keep doing that right up until the end,” Kelsier said. “Balls\nmake great excuses to meet with allies and keep an eye on enemies. House\nwars are primarily political, and so they demand political battlefields.”\nVin nodded.\n“Ham,” Kelsier said, “we need to keep an eye on the Luthadel Garrison.\nYou’re still planning to visit your soldier contacts tomorrow?”\nHam nodded. “I can’t promise anything, but I should be able to\nreestablish some connections. Give me a bit of time, and I’ll find out what\nthe military is up to.”\n“Good,” Kelsier said.\n“I’d like to go with him,” Vin said.\nKelsier paused. “With Ham?”\nVin nodded. “I haven’t trained with a Thug yet. Ham could probably\nshow me a few things.”\n“You already know how to burn pewter,” Kelsier said. “We’ve practiced\nthat.”\n“I know,” Vin said. How could she explain? Ham had practiced with\npewter exclusively—he was bound to be better at it than Kelsier.\n“Oh, stop pestering the child,” Breeze said. “She’s probably just tired of\nballs and parties. Let her go be a normal street urchin again for a bit.”\n“Fine,” Kelsier said, rolling his eyes. He poured himself another drink."

Why, I’d be a general. Do you have any idea how ludicrous that\nsounds?”\n“Just consider it,” Kelsier said. “Our recruitment should be mostly done\nby then, so you might be most effective if you were to go to the caves and\nlet Yeden come back to prepare his contacts here.”\nBreeze frowned. “I suppose.”\n“Regardless,” Kelsier said, rising. “I don’t think I’ve had nearly enough\nwine.

Yet, it really didn’t. True, it\nwas a bit different—she didn’t have to worry about sitting properly or\nwalking so that her dress didn’t brush against dirty walls or floors. Yet, the\nmundane clothing still felt natural to her.\nShe wore a simple pair of brown trousers and a loose white shirt, tucked\nin at the waist, then overlaid by a leather vest. Her still lengthening hair was\npulled up under a cap. Casual passersby might think her a boy, though Ham\ndidn’t seem to think it mattered.\nAnd it really didn’t. Vin had grown accustomed to having people study\nand evaluate her, but no one on the street even bothered to give her a\nglance. Shuffling skaa workers, unconcerned low noblemen, even high-\nplaced skaa like Clubs—they all ignored her."

Shuffling skaa workers, unconcerned low noblemen, even high-\nplaced skaa like Clubs—they all ignored her.\nI’d almost forgotten what it was like to be invisible, Vin thought.\nFortunately, the old attitudes—looking down when she walked, stepping out\nof people’s way, slouching to make herself inconspicuous—returned to her\neasily. Becoming Vin the street skaa felt as simple as remembering an old,\nfamiliar melody she used to hum.\nThis really is just another disguise, Vin thought as she walked beside\nHam. My makeup is a light coat of ash, carefully rubbed on my cheeks. My\ngown is a pair of trousers, rubbed to make them seem old and well used.\nWho, then, was she really? Vin the urchin? Valette the lady? Neither? Did\nany of her friends really know her? Did she even really know herself?\n“Ah, I’ve missed this place,” Ham said, walking happily beside her. Ham\nalways seemed happy; she couldn’t imagine him dissatisfied, despite what\nhe’d said about his time leading the army.\n“It’s kind of strange,” he said, turning to Vin. He didn’t walk with the\nsame careful air of despondence that Vin had cultivated; he didn’t even\nseem to care that he stood out from other skaa. “I probably shouldn’t miss\nthis place—I mean, Luthadel is the dirtiest, most crowded city in the Final\nEmpire. But, there’s also something about it. . . .”\n“Is this where your family lives?” Vin asked.\nHam shook his head. “They live in a smaller city outside of town. My\nwife is a seamstress there; she tells people I’m in the Luthadel Garrison.”\n“Don’t you miss them?”\n“Of course I do,” Ham said. “It’s hard—I only get to spend a few months\nat a time with them—but it’s better this way. If I were to get killed on a job,\nthe Inquisitors would have a tough time tracking my family. I haven’t even\ntold Kell which city they live in.”\n“You think the Ministry would go to that much trouble?” Vin asked. “I\nmean, you’d already be dead.”\n“I’m a Misting, Vin—that means that all of my descendants will have\nsome noble blood. My children might turn out to be Allomancers, as might\ntheir children. No, when the Inquisitors kill a Misting, they make certain to\nwipe out his children too. The only way to keep my family safe is to stay\naway from them.”\n“You could just not use your Allomancy,” Vin said.\nHam shook his head. “I don’t know if I could do that.”\n“Because of the power?”\n“No, because of the money,” Ham said frankly. “Thugs—or, Pewterarms,\nas the nobility prefer to call them—are the most sought-after Mistings. A\ncompetent Thug can stand against a half-dozen regular men, and he can lift\nmore, endure more, and move faster than any other hired muscle. Those\nthings mean a lot when you have to keep your crews small. Mix a couple of\nCoinshots with five or so Thugs, and you’ve got yourself a small, mobile"

Men will pay a lot for protection like that.”\nVin nodded. “I can see how the money would be tempting.”\n“It’s more than tempting, Vin. My family doesn’t have to live in packed\nskaa tenements, nor do they have to worry about starving. My wife only\nworks to keep up appearances—they have a good life, for skaa. Once I have\nenough, we’ll move away from the Central Dominance. There are places in\nthe Final Empire that a lot of people don’t know about—places where a\nman with enough money can live the life of a nobleman. Places where you\ncan stop worrying and just live.”\n“That sounds . . . appealing.”\nHam nodded, turning and leading them down a larger thoroughfare\ntoward the main city gates. “I got the dream from Kell, actually. That’s what\nhe always said he wanted to do. I just hope I have more luck than he did. . .\n.”\nVin frowned. “Everyone says he was rich. Why didn’t he leave?”\n“I don’t know,” Ham said. “There was always another job—each one\nbigger than the last. I guess when you’re a crewleader like him, the game\ncan get addicting. Soon, money didn’t even seem to matter to him.\nEventually, he heard that the Lord Ruler was storing some incalculable\nsecret in that hidden sanctum of his. If he and Mare had walked away\nbefore that job . . . But, well, they didn’t. I don’t know—maybe they\nwouldn’t have been happy living lives where they didn’t have to worry.”\nThe concept seemed to intrigue him, and Vin could see another of his\n“questions” working within his mind.\nI guess when you’re a crewleader like him, the game can get addicting. . .\n.\nHer earlier apprehensions returned. What would happen if Kelsier seized\nthe imperial throne for himself? He couldn’t possibly be as bad as the Lord\nRuler, but . . . she was reading more and more of the logbook. The Lord\nRuler hadn’t always been a tyrant. He’d been a good man, once. A good\nman whose life had gone wrong.\nKelsier’s different, Vin told herself forcefully. He’ll do the right thing.\nStill, she wondered. Ham might not understand, but Vin could see the\nenticement. Despite noble depravity, there was something intoxicating\nabout high society. Vin was captivated by the beauty, the music, and the\ndancing. Her fascination wasn’t the same as Kelsier’s—she wasn’t as\ninterested in political games or even scams—but she could understand why\nhe would have been reluctant to leave Luthadel behind.\nThat reluctance had destroyed the old Kelsier. But, it had produced\nsomething better—a more determined, less self-serving Kelsier. Hopefully.\nOf course, his plans before also cost him the woman he loved. Is that why\nhe hates the nobility so much?\n“Ham?” she asked. “Has Kelsier always hated the nobility?”\nHam nodded. “It’s worse now, though.”\n“He frightens me sometimes.

We’re going to confront\nKell, see if we can rein him in a bit. He means well, but he has a tendency\nto go a little overboard sometimes.”\nVin nodded. Ahead, the customary crowded lines of people waited for\npermission to pass through the city gates. She and Ham walked quietly past\nthe solemn group—workers being sent out to the docks, men off to work\none of the outer mills alongside the river or lake, lesser noblemen wishing\nto travel. All had to have a good reason to leave the city; the Lord Ruler\nstrictly controlled travel inside his realm.\nPoor things, Vin thought as she passed a ragged band of children\ncarrying pails and brushes—probably on duty to climb the wall and scrub\nmist-grown lichen off the parapets. Ahead, up near the gates, an official\ncursed and shoved a man out of the line. The skaa worker fell hard, but\neventually picked himself back up and shuffled to the end of the line. It was\nlikely that if he wasn’t let out of the city, he wouldn’t be able to do his day’s\nwork—and no work meant no food tokens for his family.\nVin followed Ham past the gates, heading down a street parallel to the\ncity wall, at the end of which Vin could see a large building complex. Vin\nhad never studied the Garrison headquarters before; most crewmembers\ntended to stay a good distance away from it. However, as they approached,\nshe was impressed by its defensive appearance. Large spikes were mounted\non the wall that ran around the entire complex. The buildings within were\nbulky and fortified. Soldiers stood at the gates, eyeing passersby with\nhostility.\nVin paused. “Ham, how are we going to get in there?”\n“Don’t worry,” he said, stopping beside her. “I’m known to the Garrison.\nBesides, it’s not as bad as it looks—the Garrison members just put on an\nintimidating face. As you can imagine, they aren’t very well liked. Most of\nthe soldiers in there are skaa—men who have, in exchange for a better life,\nsold out to the Lord Ruler. Whenever there are skaa riots in a city, the local\ngarrison is usually hit pretty hard by malcontents. Hence the fortifications.”\n“So . . . you know these men?”\nHam nodded. “I’m not like Breeze or Kell, Vin—I can’t put on faces and\npretend. I’m just who I am. Those soldiers don’t know I’m a Misting, but\nthey know I work in the underground. I’ve known many of these guys for\nyears; they’ve consistently tried to recruit me. They generally have better\nluck getting people like me, who are already outside mainstream society, to\njoin their ranks.”"

They generally have better\nluck getting people like me, who are already outside mainstream society, to\njoin their ranks.”\n“But, you’re going to betray them,” Vin said quietly, pulling Ham to the\nside of the road.\n“Betray?” he asked. “No, it won’t be a betrayal. Those men are\nmercenaries, Vin. They’ve been hired to fight, and they’ll attack friends—\neven relatives—in a riot or rebellion. Soldiers learn to understand these\nkinds of things. We may be friends, but when it comes to fighting, none of\nus would hesitate to kill the others.”\nVin nodded slowly. It seemed . . . harsh. But, that’s what life is. Harsh.\nThat part of Reen’s teaching wasn’t a lie.\n“Poor lads,” Ham said, looking at the Garrison. “We could have used\nmen like them. Before I left for the caves, I managed to recruit the few that\nI thought would be receptive. The rest . . . well, they picked their path. Like\nme, they’re just trying to give their kids a better life—the difference is,\nthey’re willing to work for him in order to do it.”\nHam turned back to her. “All right, you wanted some tips on burning\npewter?”\nVin nodded eagerly.\n“The soldiers usually let me spar with them,” Ham said. “You can watch\nme fight—burn bronze to see when I’m using Allomancy. The first, most\nimportant thing you’ll learn about Pewterarming is when to use your metal.\nI’ve noticed that young Allomancers tend to always flare their pewter,\nthinking that the stronger they are, the better. However, you don’t always\nwant to hit as hard as you can with each blow.\n“Strength is a big part of fighting, but it’s not the only part. If you always\nhit your hardest, you’ll tire faster and you’ll give your opponent\ninformation about your limitations. A smart man hits his hardest at the end\nof a battle, when his opponent is weakest. And, in an extended battle—like\na war—the smart soldier is the one who survives the longest. He’ll be the\nman who paces himself.”\nVin nodded. “But, don’t you tire slower when you’re using Allomancy?”\n“Yes,” Ham said. “In fact, a man with enough pewter can keep fighting at\nnear-peak efficiency for hours. But pewter dragging like that takes practice,\nand you’ll run out of metals eventually. When you do, the fatigue could kill\nyou.\n“Anyway, what I’m trying to explain is that it’s usually best to vary your\npewter burning. If you use more strength than you need, you could knock\nyourself off balance. Also, I’ve seen Thugs who rely on their pewter so\nmuch that they disregard training and practice. Pewter enhances your\nphysical abilities, but not your innate skill. If you don’t know how to use a\nweapon—or if you aren’t practiced at thinking quickly in a fight—you’ll\nlose no matter how strong you are.\n“I’ll have to be extra careful with the Garrison, since I don’t want them to\nknow I’m an Allomancer. You’ll be surprised at how often that’s important.\nWatch how I use pewter. I won’t just flare it for strength—if I stumble, I’ll"

There are dozens of little\ntricks you can do if you know when to give yourself a boost.”\nVin nodded.\n“Okay,” Ham said. “Let’s go, then. I’ll tell the garrisoners that you’re the\ndaughter of a relative. You look young enough for your age that they won’t\neven think twice. Watch me fight, and we’ll talk afterward.”\nVin nodded again, and the two of them approached the Garrison. Ham\nwaved to one of the guards. “Hey, Bevidon. I’ve got the day off. Is Sertes\naround?”\n“He’s here, Ham,” Bevidon said. “But I don’t know that this is the best\nday for sparring. . . .”\nHam raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”\nBevidon shared a glance with one of the other soldiers. “Go fetch the\ncaptain,” he said to the man.\nA few moments later, a busy-looking soldier approached from a side\nbuilding, waving as soon as he saw Ham. His uniform bore a few extra\nstripes of color and a few gold-colored bits of metal on the shoulder.\n“Ham,” the newcomer said, stepping through the gate.\n“Sertes,” Ham said with a smile, clasping hands with the man. “Captain\nnow, eh?”\n“Happened last month,” Sertes said with a nod. He paused, then eyed\nVin.\n“She’s my niece,” Ham said. “Good lass.”\nSertes nodded. “Could we speak alone for a moment, Ham?”\nHam shrugged and let himself get pulled to a more secluded place beside\nthe complex gates. Vin’s Allomancy let her make out what they were\nsaying. What did I ever do without tin?\n“Look, Ham,” Sertes said. “You won’t be able to come spar for a while.\nThe Garrison is going to be . . . occupied.”\n“Occupied?” Ham asked. “How?”\n“I can’t say,” Sertes said. “But . . . well, we could really use a soldier like\nyou right now.”\n“Fighting?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Must be something serious if it’s taking the attention of the entire\nGarrison.”\nSertes grew quiet for a moment, and then he spoke again in a hushed tone\n—so quiet that Vin had to strain to hear. “A rebellion,” Sertes whispered,\n“right here in the Central Dominance. We just got word. An army of skaa\nrebels appeared and attacked the Holstep Garrison to the north.”\nVin felt a sudden chill.\n“What?” Ham said.\n“They must have come from the caves up there,” the soldier said. “Last\nword was that the Holstep fortifications are holding—but Ham, they’re only\na thousand men strong.

Keep all\nthree of Clubs’s Tineyes on watch. If there’s trouble, head for the bolt-lair.”\nDockson nodded in acknowledgment as he hurriedly gave orders to the\napprentices.

That was clever\nthinking—we need an informant in there.”\nHam frowned apprehensively.\n“I don’t have time to deal with your nerves right now, Ham,” Kelsier\nsaid. “You don’t have to scam, just be yourself and listen.”\n“I won’t turn against the Garrison if I go with them,” he said. “I’ll listen,\nbut I’m not going to attack men who think I’m their ally.”\n“Fine,” Kelsier said curtly. “But I sincerely hope you can find a way not"

It is a very difficult attribute to collect.”\n“Not long enough,” Kelsier said. “I’ll go alone. Dox is in charge until I\nget back.”\nKelsier spun, then paused. Vin stood behind him in the same trousers,\ncap, and shirt she had worn to the Garrison. She had a pack like his slung\nover her shoulder, and she looked up at him defiantly.\n“This is going to be a difficult trip, Vin,” he said. “You’ve never done\nanything like this before.”\n“That’s fine.”\nKelsier nodded. He pulled his trunk out from beneath the table, then\nopened it and poured Vin a small pouch of pewter beads. She accepted it\nwithout comment.\n“Swallow five of those beads.”\n“Five?”\n“For now,” Kelsier said. “If you need to take some more, call to me so\nwe can stop running.”\n“Running?” the girl asked. “We’re not taking a canal boat?”\nKelsier frowned. “Why would we need a boat?”\nVin glanced down at the pouch, then grabbed a cup of water and began to\nswallow beads.\n“Make sure you have enough water in that pack,” Kelsier said. “Take as\nmuch as you can carry.” He left her, walking over to lay a hand on\nDockson’s shoulder. “It’s about three hours before sunset. If we push hard,\nwe can be there by noon tomorrow.”\nDockson nodded. “That might be early enough.”\nMaybe, Kelsier thought. The Valtroux Garrison is only three days’ march\nfrom Holstep. Even riding all night, a messenger couldn’t have gotten to\nLuthadel in under two days. By the time I get to the army . . .\nDockson could obviously read the worry in Kelsier’s eyes. “Either way,\nthe army is useless to us now,” he said.\n“I know,” Kelsier said. “This is just about saving those men’s lives. I’ll\nget word to you as soon as I can.”\nDockson nodded.\nKelsier turned, flaring his pewter. His pack suddenly became as light as if\nit had been empty. “Burn your pewter, Vin. We’re leaving.”\nShe nodded, and Kelsier felt a pulsing come from her. “Flare it,” he\nordered, pulling two mistcloaks from his trunk and tossing one to her. He\nput on the other, then walked forward, throwing open the back door to the\nkitchen. The red sun was bright overhead. Frantic crewmembers paused for\na moment, turning to watch as Kelsier and Vin left the building.\nThe girl hurried forward to walk at Kelsier’s side. “Ham told me that I\nshould learn to use pewter only when I need it—he said it’s better to be\nsubtle.”\nKelsier turned to face the girl. “This is not a time for subtlety.

Vin jumped into\nmotion, following him out of the alley and onto the street. Pewter was a\nblazing fire within her. Flared as it was, she would probably go through all\nfive beads in barely an hour.\nThe street was busy with skaa workers and noble carriages. Kelsier\nignored the traffic, bolting out into the very center of the street, maintaining\nhis ridiculous speed. Vin followed, growing increasingly worried about\nwhat she had gotten herself into.\nI can’t let him go alone, she thought. Of course, the last time she’d forced\nKelsier to take her with him, she’d ended up half dead in a sickbed for a\nmonth.\nKelsier wove between carriages, brushing past pedestrians, charging\ndown the street as if it were meant only for him. Vin followed as best as she\ncould, the ground a blur beneath her feet, people passing too quickly to see\ntheir faces. Some of them called out after her, their voices annoyed. A\ncouple of these, however, choked off immediately, falling silent.\nThe cloaks, Vin thought. That’s why we’re wearing them—that’s why we\nalways wear them. Noblemen who see the mistcloaks will know to stay out\nof our way.\nKelsier turned, running directly toward the northern city gates. Vin\nfollowed. Kelsier didn’t slow as he approached the gates, and the lines of\npeople began to point. Checkpoint guards turned with surprised faces.\nKelsier jumped.\nOne of the armored guards crumpled to the ground with a cry, smashed\ndown by Kelsier’s Allomantic weight as the crewleader passed overhead.\nVin took a breath, dropped a coin to give herself a bit of lift, and jumped.\nShe easily cleared a second guard, who looked up with surprise as his\ncompanion squirmed on the ground.\nVin Pushed against the soldier’s armor, throwing herself higher into the\nair. The man staggered, but stayed on his feet—Vin was nowhere near as\nheavy as Kelsier.\nShe shot over the wall, hearing cries of surprise from the soldiers on top\nof it. She could only hope that nobody recognized her. It wasn’t likely.\nThough her cap flew free as she soared through the air, those who were\nfamiliar with Valette the courtgoing lady would probably never connect her\nto a Mistborn in dirty trousers.\nVin’s cloak whipped angrily in the passing air. Kelsier completed his arc\nbefore her and began to descend, and Vin soon followed. It felt very strange\nto use Allomancy in the sunlight. Unnatural, even. Vin made the mistake of\nlooking down as she fell. Instead of comfortable swirling mists, she saw the\nground far below.\nSo high! Vin thought with horror.

She slowed her descent to\na manageable level before thumping against the ashen earth.\nKelsier immediately took off down the highway. Vin followed him,\nignoring merchants and travelers. Now that they were out of the city, she\nhad thought Kelsier might slow down. He didn’t. He sped up.\nAnd, suddenly, she understood. Kelsier didn’t intend to walk, or even jog,\nto the caves.\nHe planned to dash all the way there.\nIt was a two-week trip by canal. How long would it take them? They\nwere moving fast, horribly fast. Slower than a galloping horse, certainly, but\nsurely a horse couldn’t maintain such a gallop for very long.\nVin didn’t feel fatigue as she ran. She relied on the pewter, only passing a\nlittle of the strain onto her body. She could barely feel her footsteps hitting\nthe ground beneath her, and with such a large reserve of pewter, she felt that\nshe could maintain the speed for a decent length of time.\nShe caught up to Kelsier, falling into place beside him. “This is easier\nthan I thought it would be.”\n“Pewter enhances your balance,” Kelsier said. “Otherwise you’d be\ntripping over yourself right now.”\n“What do you think we’ll find? At the caves, I mean.”\nKelsier shook his head. “No use talking. Save your strength.”\n“But, I’m not feeling weary at all!”\n“We’ll see what you say in sixteen hours,” Kelsier said, speeding up even\nmore as they turned off the highway, running onto the wide towpath beside\nthe Luth-Davn Canal.\nSixteen hours!\nVin fell behind Kelsier slightly, giving herself plenty of space to run.\nKelsier increased their speed until they were going at a maddening pace. He\nwas right: In any other context, she would have quickly missed her step on\nthe uneven road. Yet, with pewter and tin guiding her, she managed to stay\non her feet—though doing so required increasing attention as the evening\ngrew dark and the mists came out.\nOccasionally, Kelsier threw down a coin and launched himself from one\nhilltop to another. However, he mostly kept them running at an even pace,\nsticking to the canal. Hours passed, and Vin began to feel the fatigue that he\nhad implied would come. She maintained her speed, but she could feel\nsomething underneath it—a resistance within, a longing to stop and rest.\nDespite pewter’s power, her body was running out of strength.\nShe made certain to never let her pewter run low. She feared that if it ever\nwent out, the fatigue would come upon her so powerfully that she wouldn’t\nbe able to get started again. Kelsier also ordered her to drink a ridiculous\namount of water, though she wasn’t that thirsty.\nThe night grew dark and silent, no travelers daring to brave the mists.\nThey passed canal boats and barges tied up for the night, as well as the\noccasional camp of canalmen, their tents huddled closely against the mists.\nTwice they saw mistwraiths on the road, the first one giving Vin a terrible"

Kelsier just passed it by—completely ignoring the terrible, translucent\nremnants of the people and animals who had been ingested, their bones now\nforming the mistwraith’s own skeleton.\nStill he kept running. Time became a blur, and the running came to\ndominate all that Vin was and did. Moving demanded so much attention\nthat she could barely even focus on Kelsier ahead of her in the mists. She\nkept putting one foot ahead of the other, her body remaining strong—yet, at\nthe same time, feeling terribly exhausted. Every step, quick though it was,\nbecame a chore. She began to yearn for rest.\nKelsier didn’t give it to her. He kept running, forcing her on, maintaining\nthe incredible speed. Vin’s world became a timeless thing of forced pain\nand burgeoning enervation. They slowed occasionally to drink water or\nswallow more pewter beads—but she never stopped running. It was like . . .\nlike she couldn’t stop. Vin let the exhaustion overwhelm her mind. Flared\npewter was everything. She was nothing else.\nLight surprised her. The sun began to rise, the mists vanishing. But\nKelsier didn’t let the illumination stop them. How could he? They had to\nrun. They had to just . . . had . . . to . . . keep . . . running. . . .\nI’m going to die.\nIt wasn’t the first time the thought had occurred to Vin during the run. In\nfact, the idea kept circling in her mind, picking at her brain like a carrion\nbird. She kept moving. Running.\nI hate running, she thought. That’s why I’ve always lived in a city, not out\non the countryside. So I wouldn’t have to run.\nSomething within her knew that the thought didn’t make any kind of\nsense. However, lucidity was not currently one of her virtues.\nI hate Kelsier too. He just keeps on going. How long has it been since the\nsun rose? Minutes? Hours? Weeks? Years? I swear, I don’t think—\nKelsier slowed to a stop on the road ahead of her.\nVin was so stunned that she nearly collided with him. She stumbled,\nslowing herself maladroitly, as if she had forgotten how to do anything\nother than run. She stopped, then stared down at her feet, dumbfounded.\nThis is wrong, she thought. I can’t just stand here. I have to be moving.\nShe felt herself begin to move again, but Kelsier grabbed her. She\nstruggled in his grip, resisting weakly.\nRest, something within her said. Relax. You’ve forgotten what that is, but\nit’s so nice. . . .\n“Vin!” Kelsier said. “Don’t extinguish your pewter. Keep burning it or\nyou’ll fall unconscious!”\nVin shook her head, disoriented, trying to make out his words.\n“Tin!” he said. “Flare it. Now!”\nShe did so. Her head blazed with a sudden headache that she had almost\nforgotten, and she had to close her eyes against the blinding sunlight. Her"

Her\nlegs ached, and her feet felt even worse. The sudden wash of senses\nrestored her sanity, however, and she blinked, looking up at Kelsier.\n“Better?” he asked.\nShe nodded.\n“You’ve just done something incredibly unfair to your body,” Kelsier\nsaid. “It should have shut down hours ago, but you have pewter to make it\nkeep going. You’ll recover—you’ll even get better at pushing yourself like\nthis—but right now you just have to keep burning the pewter and stay\nawake. We can sleep later.”\nVin nodded again. “Why . . .” Her voice croaked as she spoke. “Why did\nwe stop?”\n“Listen.”\nShe did. She heard . . . voices. Yelling.\nShe looked up at him. “A battle?”\nKelsier nodded. “The city of Holstep is about an hour more to the north,\nbut I think we’ve found what we came for. Come on.”\nHe released her, dropping a coin and jumping over the canal. Vin\nfollowed, following him as he rushed up a nearby hill. Kelsier crested it,\npeeking over the top. Then he stood up, staring at something to the east. Vin\ncrested the hill, and easily saw the battle—such as it was—in the distance.\nA shift in the wind brought scents to her nose.\nBlood. The valley beyond was speckled with corpses. Men still fought on\nthe far side of the valley—a small, ragged group in unmatched clothing was\nsurrounded by a much larger, uniformed army.\n“We’re too late,” Kelsier said. “Our men must have finished off the\nHolstep Garrison, then tried to march back to the caves. But Valtroux City\nis only a few days away, and its garrison is five thousand strong. Those\nsoldiers got here before we did.”\nSquinting, using tin despite the light, Vin could see that he was right. The\nlarger army wore imperial uniforms, and if the line of corpses was any\nindication, it had ambushed the skaa soldiers as it passed. Their army didn’t\nhave a chance. As she watched, the skaa began to throw up their hands, but\nthe soldiers just kept on killing them. Some of the remaining peasants\nfought desperately, but they were falling almost as quickly.\n“It’s a slaughter,” Kelsier said angrily. “The Valtroux Garrison must have\norders to wipe out the entire group.” He stepped forward.\n“Kelsier!” Vin said, grabbing his arm. “What are you doing?”\nHe turned back to her. “There are still men down there. My men.”\n“What are you going to do—attack an entire army by yourself? For what\npurpose? Your rebels don’t have Allomancy—they won’t be able to run\naway on swift feet and escape. You can’t stop an entire army, Kelsier.”\nHe shook himself free of her grip; she didn’t have the strength to hold on.\nShe stumbled, falling to the rough black dirt, throwing up a puff of ash.\nKelsier began to stalk down the hill toward the battlefield."

You\ncan’t save those men.”\nKelsier stood quietly, his fists clenched. Then, slowly, he bowed his head.\nIn the distance, the massacre continued, though there weren’t many rebels\nleft.\n“The caves,” Vin whispered. “Our force would have left men behind,\nright? Maybe they can tell us why the army exposed itself. Maybe you can\nsave the ones who stayed behind. The Lord Ruler’s men will certainly\nsearch out the army’s headquarters—if they aren’t trying already.”\nKelsier nodded. “All right. Let’s go.”\nKelsier dropped down into the cavern. He had to flare tin to see anything in\nthe deep darkness, lit only by a bit of reflected sunlight from far above.\nVin’s scraping in the crack above sounded thunderous to his overenhanced\nears. In the cavern itself . . . nothing. No sound, no light.\nSo she was wrong, Kelsier thought. No one stayed behind.\nKelsier breathed out slowly, trying to find an outlet for his frustration and\nanger. He’d abandoned the men on the battlefield. He shook his head,\nignoring what logic told him at the moment. His anger was still too fresh.\nVin dropped to the ground beside him, her figure no more than a shadow\nto his straining eyes.\n“Empty,” he declared, his voice echoing hollowly in the cavern. “You\nwere wrong.”\n“No,” Vin whispered. “There.”\nSuddenly, she was off, scrambling across the floor with a catlike\nlitheness. Kelsier called after her in the darkness, gritted his teeth, then\nfollowed her by sound down one of the corridors.\n“Vin, get back here! There’s nothing—”\nKelsier paused. He could just barely make out a flicker of light ahead of\nhim in the corridor. Bloody hell! How did she see it from so far away?\nHe could still hear Vin ahead of him. Kelsier made his way more\ncarefully, checking his metal reserves, worried about a trap left by Ministry\nagents. As he drew nearer to the light, a voice called out ahead. “Who’s\nthere? Say the password!”\nKelsier continued walking, the light growing bright enough for him to\nsee a spear-holding figure backlit in the corridor ahead. Vin waited in the\ndarkness, crouching. She looked up questioningly as Kelsier passed. She\nseemed to have gotten over the drain of the pewter drag, for the moment.\nWhen they finally stopped to rest, however, she’d feel it.\n“I can hear you!” the guard said anxiously. His voice sounded slightly\nfamiliar. “Identify yourself.”\nCaptain Demoux, Kelsier realized. One of ours. It’s not a trap.\n“Say the password!” Demoux commanded.\n“I need no password,” Kelsier said, stepping into the light.\nDemoux lowered his spear. “Lord Kelsier? You’ve come . . . does that\nmean the army succeeded?”"

You’ve come . . . does that\nmean the army succeeded?”\nKelsier ignored the question. “Why aren’t you guarding the entrance\nback there?”\n“We . . . thought it would be more defensible to retreat to the inner\ncomplex, my lord. There aren’t a lot of us left.”\nKelsier glanced back toward the entrance corridor. How long until the\nLord Ruler’s men find a captive willing to talk? Vin was right after all—we\nneed to get these men to safety.\nVin stood and approached, studying the young soldier with those quiet\neyes of hers. “How many of you are there?”\n“About two thousand,” Demoux said. “We . . . were wrong, my lord. I’m\nsorry.”\nKelsier looked back at him. “Wrong?”\n“We thought that General Yeden was acting rashly,” Demoux said,\nblushing in shame. “We stayed behind. We . . . thought we were being loyal\nto you, rather than him. But we should have gone with the rest of the army.”\n“The army is dead,” Kelsier said curtly. “Gather your men, Demoux. We\nneed to leave now.”\nThat night, sitting on a tree stump with the mists gathering around him,\nKelsier finally forced himself to confront the day’s events.\nHe sat with his hands clasped before him, listening to the last, faint\nsounds of the army’s men bedding down. Fortunately, someone had thought\nto prepare the group for quick departure. Each man had a bedroll, a weapon,\nand enough food for two weeks. As soon as Kelsier discovered who had\nbeen so foresighted, he intended to give the man a hefty promotion.\nNot that there was much to command anymore. The remaining two\nthousand men included a depressingly large number of soldiers who were\npast or before their prime—men wise enough to see that Yeden’s plan had\nbeen insane, or men young enough to be frightened.\nKelsier shook his head. So many dead. They’d gathered nearly seven\nthousand troops before this fiasco, but now most of them lay dead. Yeden\nhad apparently decided to “test” the army by striking at night against the\nHolstep Garrison. What had led him to such a foolish decision?\nMe, Kelsier thought. This is my fault. He’d promised them supernatural\naid. He’d set himself up, had made Yeden a part of the crew, and had talked\nso casually about doing the impossible. Was it any wonder that Yeden had\nthought he could attack the Final Empire head on, considering the\nconfidence Kelsier had given him? Was it any wonder the soldiers would go\nwith the man, considering the promises Kelsier had made?\nNow men were dead, and Kelsier was responsible. Death wasn’t new to\nhim. Neither was failure—not anymore. But, he couldn’t get over the\ntwisting in his gut. True, the men had died fighting the Final Empire, which\nwas as good a death as any skaa could hope for—however, the fact that\nthey’d likely died expecting some sort of divine protection from Kelsier . . .\nthat was disturbing.\nYou knew this would be hard, he told himself. You understood the burden\nyou were taking upon yourself."

You understood the burden\nyou were taking upon yourself.\nBut, what right had he? Even members of his own crew—Ham, Breeze,\nand the others—assumed that the Final Empire was invincible. They\nfollowed because of their faith in Kelsier, and because he had couched his\nplans in the form of a thieving job. Well, now that job’s patron was dead; a\nscout sent to check the battlefield had, for better or worse, been able to\nconfirm Yeden’s death. The soldiers had put his head on a spear beside the\nroad, along with several of Ham’s officers.\nThe job was dead. They had failed. The army was gone. There would be\nno rebellion, no seizing of the city.\nFootsteps approached. Kelsier looked up, wondering if he even had the\nstrength to stand. Vin lay curled up beside his stump, asleep on the hard\nground, only her mistcloak for a cushion. Their extended pewter drag had\ntaken a lot out of the girl, and she had collapsed virtually the moment\nKelsier had called a halt for the night. He wished he could do the same.\nHowever, he was far more experienced with pewter dragging than she was.\nHis body would give out eventually, but he could keep going for a bit\nlonger.\nA figure appeared from the mists, hobbling in Kelsier’s direction. The\nman was old, older than any that Kelsier had recruited. He must have been\npart of the rebellion from earlier—one of the skaa who had been living in\nthe caves before Kelsier hijacked them.\nThe man chose a large stone beside Kelsier’s stump, sitting with a sigh. It\nwas amazing that one so old had even been able to keep up. Kelsier had\nmoved the group at a fast pace, seeking to distance them as much as\npossible from the cave complex.\n“The men will sleep fitfully,” the old man said. “They aren’t accustomed\nto being out in the mists.”\n“They don’t have much choice,” Kelsier said.\nThe old man shook his head. “I suppose they don’t.” He sat for a\nmoment, aged eyes unreadable. “You don’t recognize me, do you?”\nKelsier paused, then shook his head. “I’m sorry. Did I recruit you?”\n“After a fashion. I was one of the skaa at Lord Tresting’s plantation.”\nKelsier opened his mouth slightly in surprise, finally recognizing a slight\nfamiliarity to the man’s bald head and tired, yet somehow strong, posture.\n“The old man I sat with that night. Your name was . . .”\n“Mennis. After you killed Tresting, we retreated up to the caves, where\nthe rebels there took us in. A lot of the others left eventually, off to find\nother plantations to join. Some of us stayed.”\nKelsier nodded. “You’re behind this, aren’t you?” he said, gesturing\ntoward the camp. “The preparations?”\nMennis shrugged. “Some of us can’t fight, so we do other things.”\nKelsier leaned forward. “What happened, Mennis? Why did Yeden do\nthis?”"

Why did Yeden do\nthis?”\nMennis just shook his head. “Though most expect young men to be fools,\nI’ve noticed that just a little bit of age can make a man far more foolish than\nhe was as a child. Yeden . . . well, he was the type who was too easily\nimpressed—both by you and by the reputation you left for him. Some of his\ngenerals thought it might be a good idea to give the men some practical\nbattle experience, and they figured a night raid on the Holstep Garrison\nwould be a clever move. Apparently, it was more difficult than they\nassumed.”\nKelsier shook his head. “Even if they’d been successful, exposing the\narmy would have made it useless to us.”\n“They believed in you,” Mennis said quietly. “They thought that they\ncouldn’t fail.”\nKelsier sighed, resting his head back, staring up into the shifting mists.\nHe slowly let his breath exhale, its air mingling with the currents overhead.\n“So, what becomes of us?” Mennis asked.\n“We’ll split you up,” Kelsier said, “get you back into Luthadel in small\ngroups, lose you among the skaa population.”\nMennis nodded. He seemed tired—exhausted—yet he didn’t retire.\nKelsier could understand that feeling.\n“Do you remember our conversation back on Tresting’s plantation?”\nMennis asked.\n“A bit,” Kelsier said. “You tried to dissuade me from making trouble.”\n“But it didn’t stop you.”\n“Troublemaking is just about the only thing I’m good at, Mennis. Do you\nresent what I did there, what I forced you to become?”\nMennis paused, then nodded. “But, in a way, I’m thankful for that\nresentment. I believed that my life was over—I awoke each day expecting\nthat I wouldn’t have the strength to rise. But . . . well, I found purpose again\nin the caves. For that, I’m grateful.”\n“Even after what I did to the army?”\nMennis snorted. “Don’t think quite so highly of yourself, young man.\nThose soldiers got themselves killed. You might have been their motivation,\nbut you didn’t make the choice for them.\n“Regardless, this isn’t the first skaa rebellion to get slaughtered. Not by\nfar. In a way, you’ve accomplished a lot—you gathered an army of\nconsiderable size, and then you armed and trained it beyond what anyone\nhad a right to expect. Things went a little more quickly than you\nanticipated, but you should be proud of yourself.”\n“Proud?” Kelsier asked, standing to work off some of his agitation. “This\narmy was supposed to help overthrow the Final Empire, not get itself killed\nfighting a meaningless battle in a valley weeks outside of Luthadel.”\n“Overthrow the . . .” Mennis looked up, frowning. “You really expected\nto do something like that?”\n“Of course,” Kelsier said. “Why else would I gather an army like this?”\n“To resist,” Mennis said. “To fight.

It wasn’t a matter of winning or losing, it was a matter of doing\nsomething—anything—to struggle against the Lord Ruler.”\nKelsier turned, frowning. “You expected the army to lose from the\nbeginning?”\n“What other end was there?” Mennis asked. He stood, shaking his head.\n“Some may have begun to dream otherwise, lad, but the Lord Ruler can’t be\ndefeated. Once, I gave you some advice—I told you to be careful which\nbattles you chose to fight. Well, I’ve realized that this battle was worth\nfighting.\n“Now, let me give you another piece of advice, Kelsier, Survivor of\nHathsin. Know when to quit. You’ve done well, better than any would have\nexpected. Those skaa of yours killed an entire garrison’s worth of soldiers\nbefore they were caught and destroyed. This is the greatest victory the skaa\nhave known in decades, perhaps centuries. Now it’s time to walk away.”\nWith that, the old man nodded his head in respect, then began to shuffle\nback toward the center of the camp.\nKelsier stood, dumbfounded. The greatest victory the skaa have known in\ndecades . . .\nThat was what he fought against. Not just the Lord Ruler, not just the\nnobility. He fought against a thousand years of conditioning, a thousand\nyears of life in a society that would label the deaths of five thousand men as\na “great victory.” Life was so hopeless for the skaa that they’d been reduced\nto finding comfort in expected defeats.\n“That wasn’t a victory, Mennis,” Kelsier whispered. “I’ll show you a\nvictory.”\nHe forced himself to smile—not out of pleasure, and not out of\nsatisfaction. He smiled despite the grief he felt at the deaths of his men; he\nsmiled because that was what he did. That was how he proved to the Lord\nRuler—and to himself—that he wasn’t beaten.\nNo, he wasn’t going to walk away. He wasn’t finished yet.

She didn’t know how Kelsier had\nkept going, leading the remnants of their army to a safe location.\nThat had been over two weeks ago. Fifteen full days, and her head still\nhurt. Kelsier said it was good for her. He claimed that she needed to\npractice “pewter dragging,” training her body to function beyond what it\nthought possible. Despite what he said, however, she doubted something\nthat hurt so much could possibly be “good” for her.\nOf course, it might well be a useful skill to have.

She and Kelsier had\nbeen able to run to the battlefield in under a single day. The return trip had\ntaken two weeks.\nVin rose, stretching tiredly. They’d been back for less than a day, in fact.\nKelsier had probably stayed up half the night explaining events to the other\ncrewmembers. Vin, however, had been happy to go straight to bed. The\nnights spent sleeping on the hard earth had reminded her that a comfortable\nbed was a luxury she’d started to take for granted.\nShe yawned, rubbed her temples again, then threw on a robe and made\nher way to the bathroom. She was pleased to see that Clubs’s apprentices\nhad remembered to draw her a bath. She locked the door, disrobed, and\nsettled into the warm, lightly scented bathwater. Had she ever really found\nthose scents obnoxious? The smell would make her less inconspicuous,\ntrue, but that seemed a slim price for ridding herself of the dirt and grime\nshe’d picked up while traveling.\nShe still found longer hair an annoyance, however. She washed it,\ncombing out the tangles and knots, wondering how the court women could\nstand hair that went all the way down their backs. How long must they\nspend combing and primping beneath a servant’s care? Vin’s hair hadn’t\neven reached her shoulders yet, and she was already loath to let it get\nlonger. It would fly about and whip her face when she jumped, not to\nmention provide her foes with something to grab on to.\nOnce finished bathing, she returned to her room, dressed in something\npractical, and made her way downstairs. Apprentices bustled in the\nworkroom and housekeepers worked upstairs, but the kitchen was quiet.\nClubs, Dockson, Ham, and Breeze sat at the morning meal. They looked up\nas Vin entered.\n“What?” Vin asked grumpily, pausing in the doorway. The bath had\nsoothed her headache somewhat, but it still pulsed slightly in the back of\nher head.\nThe four men exchanged glances. Ham spoke first. “We were just\ndiscussing the status of the plan, now that both our employer and our army\nare gone.”\nBreeze raised an eyebrow. “Status? That’s an interesting way of putting\nit, Hammond. I would have said ‘unfeasibility’ instead.”\nClubs grunted his assent, and the four turned to her, apparently waiting to\nsee her reaction.\nWhy do they care so much what I think? she thought, walking into the\nroom and taking a chair.\n“You want something to eat?” Dockson said, rising. “Clubs’s\nhousekeepers fixed some baywraps for us to—”\n“Ale,” Vin said.\nDockson paused. “It’s not even noon.”\n“Ale. Now. Please.” She leaned forward, folding her arms on the table\nand resting her head on them.\nHam had the nerve to chuckle. “Pewter drag?”\nVin nodded.\n“It’ll pass,” he said.\n“If I don’t die first,” Vin grumbled.\nHam chuckled again, but the levity seemed forced.

Breeze, Ham, and Yeden spent all their time\nrecruiting; Dockson and Renoux worked on supplies. Now that the soldiers\nare gone . . . well, that only leaves Marsh’s work with the Ministry and\nKell’s attacks on the nobility—and neither are things he needs us for. The\ncrew is redundant.”\nThe room fell silent.\n“She has a depressingly blunt way of putting it,” Dockson said.\n“Pewter drag will do that to you,” Ham noted.\n“When did you get back, anyway?” Vin asked.\n“Last night, after you were asleep,” Ham said. “The Garrison sent us\npart-time soldiers back early, so they wouldn’t have to pay us.”\n“They’re still out there, then?” Dockson asked.\nHam nodded. “Hunting down the rest of our army. The Luthadel Garrison\nrelieved the Valtroux troops, who were actually pretty beat up from the\nfighting. The majority of the Luthadel troops should be out for a long while\nyet, searching for rebels—apparently, several very large groups broke off of\nour main army and fled before the battle started.”\nThe conversation lulled into another period of silence. Vin sipped at her\nale, drinking it more out of spite than any belief that it would make her feel\nbetter. A few minutes later, footsteps sounded on the stairs.\nKelsier swept into the kitchen. “Good morning, all,” he said with\ncustomary cheerfulness. “Baywraps again, I see. Clubs, you really need to\nhire more imaginative housemaids.” Despite the comment, he grabbed a\ncylindrical baywrap and took a large bite, then smiled pleasantly as he\npoured himself something to drink.\nThe crew remained quiet. The men exchanged glances. Kelsier remained\nstanding, leaning back against the cupboard as he ate.\n“Kell, we need to talk,” Dockson finally said. “The army is gone.”\n“Yes,” Kelsier said between bites. “I noticed.”\n“The job is dead, Kelsier,” Breeze said. “It was a good try, but we failed.”\nKelsier paused. He frowned, lowering his baywrap. “Failed? What makes\nyou say that?”\n“The army is gone, Kell,” Ham said.\n“The army was only one piece of our plans. We’ve had a setback, true—\nbut we’re hardly finished.”\n“Oh, for the Lord’s sake, man!” Breeze said. “How can you stand there\nso cheerfully? Our men are dead. Don’t you even care?”\n“I care, Breeze,” Kelsier said in a solemn voice. “But what is done is\ndone. We need to move on.”\n“Exactly!” Breeze said. “Move on from this insane ‘job’ of yours. It’s\ntime to quit. I know you don’t like that, but it’s the simple truth!”\nKelsier set his plate on the counter. “Don’t Soothe me, Breeze. Never"

A gathering, in the fountain square!”\nKelsier didn’t look surprised by the boy’s announcement.\n“A gathering in the fountain square?” Ham said slowly. “That means . . .”\n“Come on,” Kelsier said, standing up straight. “We’re going to watch.”\n“I’d rather not do this, Kell,” Ham said. “I avoid these things for a\nreason.”\nKelsier ignored him. He walked at the head of the crew, who all—even\nBreeze—wore mundane skaa clothing and cloaks. A light ashfall had begun,\nand careless flakes floated down from the sky, like leaves dropped from\nsome unseen tree.\nLarge clusters of skaa clogged the street, most of them workers from\nfactories or mills. Vin knew of only one reason why the workers would be\nreleased and sent to gather in the city’s central square.\nExecutions.\nShe’d never gone to them before. Supposedly, all the men in the city—\nskaa or noble—were required to attend execution ceremonies, but thieving\ncrews knew how to remain hidden. Bells rang in the distance, announcing\nthe event, and obligators watched at the sides of the streets. They would go\ninto mills, forges, and random houses searching for those who disobeyed\nthe call, meting out death as a punishment. Gathering this many people was\nan enormous undertaking—but, in a way, doing things like this simply\nworked to prove how powerful the Lord Ruler was.\nThe streets grew even more crowded as Vin’s crew approached the\nfountain square. Building roofs were packed, and people filled the streets,\npressing forward. There’s no way they’ll all fit. Luthadel wasn’t like most\nother cities; its population was enormous. Even with only the men in\nattendance, there was no way everyone would have a view of the\nexecutions.\nYet, they came anyway. Partially because they were required, partially\nbecause they wouldn’t have to work while they watched, and partially—Vin\nsuspected—because they had the same morbid curiosity that all men\npossessed."

Partially because they were required, partially\nbecause they wouldn’t have to work while they watched, and partially—Vin\nsuspected—because they had the same morbid curiosity that all men\npossessed.\nAs the crowds grew thicker, Kelsier, Dockson, and Ham began to shove\nthe crew a path through the onlookers. Some of the skaa gave the crew\nlooks of resentment, though many were just dull-eyed and compliant. Some\nappeared surprised, even excited, when they saw Kelsier, though his scars\nwere not showing. These people moved aside eagerly.\nEventually, the crew reached the outer row of buildings surrounding the\nsquare. Kelsier picked one, nodding toward it, and Dockson moved\nforward. A man at the doorway tried to bar his entrance, but Dox pointed\ntoward the roof, then hefted his coinpouch suggestively. A few minutes\nlater, the crew had the entire rooftop to themselves.\n“Smoke us please, Clubs,” Kelsier said quietly.\nThe gnarled craftsman nodded, making the crew invisible to Allomantic\nbronze senses. Vin walked over and crouched beside the roof’s lip, hands on\nthe short stone railing as she scanned the square down below. “So many\npeople . . .”\n“You’ve lived in cities all your life, Vin,” Ham said, standing next to her.\n“Surely you’ve seen crowds before.”\n“Yes, but . . .” How could she explain? The shifting, overpacked mass\nwas unlike anything she’d seen. It was expansive, almost endless, its trails\nfilling every street leading away from the central square. The skaa were\npacked so closely, she wondered how they even had room to breathe.\nThe noblemen were at the center of the square, separated from the skaa\nby soldiers. They were close to the central fountain patio, which stood about\nfive feet above the rest of the square. Someone had constructed seating for\nthe nobility, and they lounged, as if they were visiting some show or horse\nrace. Many had servants holding up parasols against the ash, but it was\nfalling lightly enough that some just ignored it.\nStanding beside the noblemen were the obligators—regular ones in gray,\nInquisitors in black. Vin shivered. There were eight Inquisitors, their lanky\nforms standing a head above the obligators. But, it wasn’t just height that\nseparated the dark creatures from their cousins. There was an air, a\ndistinctive posture, about the Steel Inquisitors.\nVin turned, studying the regular obligators instead. Most of them held\nthemselves proudly in their administrative robes—the higher their position,\nthe finer the robes. Vin squinted, burning tin, and recognized a moderately\nfamiliar face.\n“There,” she said, pointing. “That one’s my father.”\nKelsier perked up. “Where?”\n“At the front of the obligators,” Vin said. “The shorter one with the\ngolden robe-scarf.”\nKelsier fell silent. “That’s your father?” he finally asked.\n“Who?” Dockson asked, squinting. “I can’t make out their faces.”\n“Tevidian,” Kelsier said.\n“The lord prelan?” Dockson asked with shock.\n“What?” Vin asked. “Who’s that?”"

Vin had assumed that they were too\npacked to move, but apparently she was wrong. The people began to pull\nback, making a large corridor leading to the central platform.\nWhat could make them—\nThen she felt it. The oppressive numbness, like a massive blanket\npressing down, choking away her air, stealing her will. She immediately\nburned copper. Yet, like before, she swore that she could feel the Lord\nRuler’s Soothing despite the metal. She sensed him coming closer, trying to\nmake her lose all will, all desire, all strength of emotion.\n“He’s coming,” Spook whispered, crouching down beside her.\nA black carriage drawn by a pair of massive white stallions appeared\ndown a side street. It rolled down the corridor of skaa, moving with a sense\nof . . . inevitability. Vin saw several people get clipped by its passing, and\nsuspected that if a man were to fall into the carriage’s path, the vehicle\nwouldn’t even slow as it crushed him to death.\nThe skaa sagged a bit more as the Lord Ruler arrived, a visible ripple\nwashing across the crowd, their postures drooping as they felt his powerful\nSoothing. The background roar of whispers and chatting dampened, an\nunreal silence falling over the enormous square.\n“He’s so powerful,” Breeze said. “Even at my best, I can only Soothe a\ncouple hundred men. There have to be tens of thousands of people here!”\nSpook looked over the rim of the rooftop. “It makes me want to fall. To\njust let go . . .”\nThen, he paused. He shook his head, as if waking up. Vin frowned.\nSomething felt different. Tentatively, she extinguished her copper, and\nrealized that she could no longer feel the Lord Ruler’s Soothing. The\nfeeling of awful depression—of soullessness and emptiness—had strangely\ndisappeared. Spook looked up, and the rest of the crewmembers stood just a\nlittle straighter.\nVin glanced around. The skaa below looked unchanged. Yet, her friends\n—\nHer eyes found Kelsier. The crewleader stood straight-backed, staring\nresolutely at the approaching carriage, a look of concentration on his face.\nHe’s Rioting our emotions, Vin realized. He’s counteracting the Lord\nRuler’s power. It was obviously a struggle for Kelsier to protect even their\nsmall group.\nBreeze is right, Vin thought. How can we fight something like this? The\nLord Ruler is Soothing a hundred thousand people at once!\nBut, Kelsier fought on. Just in case, Vin turned on her copper.

It felt like she was Pulling against some massive, immobile\nwall. Yet, it must have helped, for Kelsier relaxed slightly, shooting her a\ngrateful look.\n“Look,” Dockson said, probably unaware of the unseen battle that\noccurred around him. “The prisoner carts.” He pointed toward a set of ten\nlarge, bar-lined carts traveling down the corridor behind the Lord Ruler.\n“Do you recognize anyone in them?” Ham said, leaning forward.\n“I’m not of the seeing,” Spook said, looking uncomfortable. “Uncle, you\nreally the burn, right?”\n“Yes, my copper is on,” Clubs said testily. “You’re safe. We’re far\nenough away from the Lord Ruler that it wouldn’t matter anyway—that\nplaza is enormous.”\nSpook nodded, then obviously began burning tin. A moment later, he\nshook his head. “Notting of the recognizing anyone.”\n“You weren’t there for a lot of the recruiting, though, Spook,” Ham said,\nsquinting.\n“True,” Spook replied. Though his accent remained, he was obviously\nmaking an effort to speak normally.\nKelsier stepped up to the ledge, holding a hand up to shade his eyes. “I\ncan see the prisoners. No, I don’t recognize any of the faces. They aren’t\ncaptive soldiers.”\n“Who, then?” Ham asked.\n“Mostly women and children, it appears,” Kelsier said.\n“The families of the soldiers?” Ham asked, horrified.\nKelsier shook his head. “I doubt it. They wouldn’t have taken the time to\nidentify dead skaa.”\nHam frowned, looking confused.\n“Random people, Hammond,” Breeze said with a quiet sigh. “Examples\n—casual executions made in order to punish the skaa for harboring rebels.”\n“No, not even that,” Kelsier said. “I doubt the Lord Ruler even knows, or\ncares, that most of those men were recruited from Luthadel. He probably\njust assumes that it was another countryside rebellion. This . . . this is just a\nway of reminding everyone who is in control.”\nThe Lord Ruler’s carriage rolled up a platform onto the central patio. The\nominous vehicle pulled to a stop in the exact center of the square, but the\nLord Ruler himself remained inside.\nThe prisoner carts pulled to a stop, and a group of obligators and soldiers\nbegan to unload them. Black ash continued to fall as the first group of\nprisoners—most struggling only weakly—were dragged up onto the raised\ncentral platform. An Inquisitor directed the work, gesturing for prisoners to\nbe gathered beside each of the platform’s four bowl-like fountains.\nFour prisoners were forced to their knees—one beside each running\nfountain—and four Inquisitors raised obsidian axes. Four axes fell, and four\nheads were sheared free. The bodies, still held by soldiers, were allowed to\nspurt their last lifeblood into the fountain basins.\nThe fountains began to glisten red as they sprayed into the air. The\nsoldiers tossed the bodies aside, then brought four more people forward."

The\nsoldiers tossed the bodies aside, then brought four more people forward.\nSpook looked away sickly. “Why . . . why doesn’t Kelsier do something?\nTo saving them, I mean?”\n“Don’t be foolish,” Vin said. “There are eight Inquisitors down there—\nnot to mention the Lord Ruler himself. Kelsier would be an idiot to try\nsomething.”\nThough I wouldn’t be surprised if he considered it, she thought,\nremembering when Kelsier had been ready to rush down and take on an\nentire army by himself. She glanced to the side. Kelsier looked like he was\nforcibly holding himself back—white-knuckled hands gripping the chimney\nbeside him—to keep himself from rushing down to stop the executions.\nSpook stumbled over to another part of the rooftop where he could retch\nwithout spilling bile onto the people below. Ham groaned slightly, and even\nClubs looked saddened. Dockson watched solemnly, as if witnessing the\ndeaths were some sort of vigil. Breeze just shook his head.\nKelsier, however . . . Kelsier was angry. His face red, his muscles tense,\nhis eyes ablaze.\nFour more deaths, one of them a child.\n“This,” Kelsier said, angrily waving his hand toward the central square.\n“This is our enemy. There is no quarter here, no walking away. This is no\nsimple job, to be thrown aside when we encounter a few unexpected\ntwists.”\nFour more deaths.\n“Look at them!” Kelsier demanded, pointing at the bleachers full of\nnobility. Most of them appeared bored—and a few even seemed to be\nenjoying themselves, turning and joking with one another as the beheadings\ncontinued.\n“I know you question me,” Kelsier said, turning to the crew. “You think\nthat I’ve been too hard on the nobility, think that I relish killing them too\nmuch. But, can you honestly see those men laughing and tell me that they\ndon’t deserve to die by my blade? I only bring them justice.”\nFour more deaths.\nVin searched the bleachers with urgent, tin-enhanced eyes. She found\nElend sitting amid a group of younger men. None of them were laughing,\nand they weren’t the only ones. True, many of the nobility made light of the\nexperience, but there were some small minority who looked horrified.\nKelsier continued. “Breeze, you asked about the atium. I’ll be honest. It\nwas never my main goal—I gathered this crew because I wanted to change\nthings. We’ll grab the atium—we’ll need it to support a new government—\nbut this job isn’t about making me, or any of you, wealthy.\n“Yeden is dead. He was our excuse—a way that we could do something\ngood while still pretending to just be thieves. Now that he’s gone, you can\ngive up, if you want. Quit. But, that won’t change anything. The struggle\nwill go on. Men will still die. You’ll just be ignoring it.”\nFour more deaths.\n“It’s time to stop the charade,” Kelsier said, staring at them each in turn."

We have to admit that it isn’t about money. It’s about stopping\nthat.” He pointed at the courtyard with its red fountains—a visible sign of\ndeath for the thousands of skaa too far away to even tell what was\nhappening.\n“I intend to continue my fight,” Kelsier said quietly. “I realize that some\nof you question my leadership. You think I’ve been building myself up too\nmuch with the skaa. You whisper that I’m making myself into another Lord\nRuler—you think that my ego is more important to me than overthrowing\nthe empire.”\nHe paused, and Vin saw guilt in the eyes of Dockson and the others.\nSpook rejoined the group, still looking a bit sick.\nFour more deaths.\n“You’re wrong,” Kelsier said quietly. “You have to trust me. You gave\nme your confidence when we began this plan, despite how dangerous things\nseemed. I still need that confidence! No matter how things appear, no matter\nhow terrible the odds, we have to keep fighting!”\nFour more deaths.\nThe crew slowly turned toward Kelsier. Resisting the Lord Ruler’s\nPushing on their emotions didn’t seem like half as much a struggle for\nKelsier anymore, though Vin had let her zinc lapse.\nMaybe . . . maybe he can do it, Vin thought, despite herself. If there was\never a man who could defeat the Lord Ruler, it would be Kelsier.\n“I didn’t choose you men because of your competence,” Kelsier said,\n“though you are certainly skilled. I chose each of you specifically because I\nknew you to be men of conscience. Ham, Breeze, Dox, Clubs . . . you are\nmen with reputations for honesty, even charity. I knew that if I were going\nto succeed at this plan, I would need men who actually cared.\n“No, Breeze, this isn’t about boxings or about glory. This is about war—a\nwar we have been fighting for a thousand years, a war I intend to end. You\nmay go, if you wish. You know I’ll let any of you out—no questions asked,\nno repercussions exacted—if you wish to go.\n“However,” he said, eyes growing hard, “if you stay, you have to promise\nto stop questioning my authority. You can voice concerns about the job\nitself, but there will be no more whispered conferences about my\nleadership. If you stay, you follow me. Understood?”\nOne by one, he locked eyes with the crewmembers. Each one gave him a\nnod.\n“I don’t think we ever really questioned you, Kell,” Dockson said. “We\njust . . . we’re worried, and I think rightly so. The army was a big part of\nour plans.”\nKelsier nodded to the north, toward the main city gates. “What do you\nsee up in the distance, Dox?”\n“The city gates?”\n“And what is different about them recently?”\nDockson shrugged. “Nothing unusual. They’re a bit understaffed, but—”"

They’re a bit understaffed, but—”\n“Why?” Kelsier interjected. “Why are they understaffed?”\nDockson paused. “Because the Garrison is gone?”\n“Exactly,” Kelsier said. “Ham says that the Garrison could be out chasing\nremnants of our army for months, and only about ten percent of its men\nstayed behind. That makes sense—stopping rebels is the sort of thing the\nGarrison was created to do. Luthadel might be exposed, but no one ever\nattacks Luthadel. No one ever has.”\nA quiet understanding passed between the members of the crew.\n“Part one of our plan to take the city has been accomplished,” Kelsier\nsaid. “We got the Garrison out of Luthadel. It cost us far more than we\nexpected—far more than it should have. I wish to the Forgotten Gods that\nthose boys hadn’t died. Unfortunately, we can’t change that now—we can\nonly use the opening they gave us.\n“The plan is still in motion—the main peacekeeping force in the city is\ngone. If a house war starts in earnest, the Lord Ruler will have a difficult\ntime stopping it. Assuming he wants to. For some reason, he tends to step\nback and let the nobility fight each other every hundred years or so. Perhaps\nhe finds that letting them at each other’s throats keeps them away from his\nown.”\n“But, what if the Garrison comes back?” Ham asked.\n“If I’m right,” Kelsier said, “the Lord Ruler will let them chase stragglers\nfrom our army for several months, giving the nobility a chance to blow off a\nlittle steam. Except, he’s going to get a lot more than he expected. When\nthat house war starts, we’re going to use the chaos to seize the palace.”\n“With what army, my dear man?” Breeze said.\n“We still have some troops left,” Kelsier said. “Plus, we have time to\nrecruit more. We’ll have to be careful—we can’t use the caves, so we’ll\nhave to hide our troops in the city. That will probably mean smaller\nnumbers. However, that won’t be an issue—you see, that garrison is going\nto return eventually.”\nThe members of the group shared a look as the executions proceeded\nbelow. Vin sat quietly, trying to decide what Kelsier meant by that\nstatement.\n“Exactly, Kell,” Ham said slowly. “The Garrison will return, and we\nwon’t have a big enough army to fight them.”\n“But we will have the Lord Ruler’s treasury,” Kelsier said, smiling.\n“What is it you always say about those Garrisoners, Ham?”\nThe Thug paused, then smiled too. “That they’re mercenaries.”\n“We seize the Lord Ruler’s money,” Kelsier said, “and it means we get\nhis army too. This can still work, gentlemen. We can make it work.”\nThe crew seemed to grow more confident. Vin, however, turned her eyes\nback toward the square.

He does not believe that an outsider such as myself—a foreigner—could possibly be the Hero of Ages.\nHe believes that I have somehow tricked the philosophers, that I wear the piercings of the Hero unjustly.\nAccording to Rashek, only a Terrisman of pure blood should have been chosen as the Hero.

Once the captives were gone, the Lord Ruler and his obligators\nhad ridden away, leaving a pile of corpses on the platform and bloodied\nwater running in the fountains.\nAs Kelsier’s crew returned to the kitchen, Vin realized that her headache\nno longer bothered her. Her pain now seemed . . . insignificant. The\nbaywraps remained on the table, thoughtfully covered by one of the house\nmaids. No one reached for them.\n“All right,” Kelsier said, taking his customary place leaning against the\ncupboard. “Let’s plan this out. How should we proceed?”\nDockson recovered a stack of papers from the side of the room as he\nwalked over to seat himself. “With the Garrison gone, our main focus\nbecomes the nobility.”\n“Indeed,” Breeze said. “If we truly intend to seize the treasury with only\na few thousand soldiers, then we’re certainly going to need something to\ndistract the palace guard and keep the nobility from taking the city away\nfrom us. The house war, therefore, becomes of paramount importance.”\nKelsier nodded. “My thoughts exactly.”\n“But, what happens when the house war is over?” Vin said. “Some\nhouses will come out on top, and then we’ll have to deal with them.”\nKelsier shook his head. “I don’t intend for the house war to ever end, Vin\n—or, at least, not for a long while. The Lord Ruler makes dictates, and the\nMinistry polices his followers, but the nobility are the ones who actually\nforce the skaa to work. So, if we bring down enough noble houses, the\ngovernment may just collapse on its own. We can’t fight the entire Final\nEmpire as a whole—it’s too big. But, we might be able to shatter it, then\nmake the pieces fight each other.”\n“We need to put financial strain on the Great Houses,” Dockson said,\nflipping through his papers. “The aristocracy is primarily a financial\ninstitution, and lack of funds will bring any house down.”"

I can’t\ngo to parties or functions—but I can probably do solitary house visits.”\n“Same for you, Dox,” Kelsier said.\n“I figured as much,” Dockson said.\n“It will be dangerous for both of you,” Kelsier said. “But speed will be\nessential. Vin will remain our main spy—and we’ll probably want her to\nstart spreading some bad information. Anything to make the nobility\nuncertain.”\nHam nodded. “We should probably focus our attentions on the top, then.”\n“Indeed,” Breeze said. “If we can make the most powerful houses look\nvulnerable, then their enemies will be quick to strike. Only after the\npowerful houses are gone will people realize that they were the ones really\nsupporting the economy.”\nThe room fell quiet for a second, then several heads turned toward Vin.\n“What?” she asked.\n“They’re talking about House Venture, Vin,” Dockson said. “It’s the most\npowerful of the Great Houses.”\nBreeze nodded. “If Venture falls, the entire Final Empire would feel the\ntremors.”\nVin sat quietly for a moment. “They’re not all bad people,” she finally\nsaid.\n“Perhaps,” Kelsier said. “But Lord Straff Venture certainly is, and his\nfamily sits at the very head of the Final Empire. House Venture needs to go\n—and you already have an in with one of its most important members.”\nI thought you wanted me to stay away from Elend, she thought with\nannoyance.\n“Just keep your ears open, child,” Breeze said. “See if you can get the lad\nto talk about his house’s finances.

A\nfew moments later, Sazed—clad in a skaa cloak to hide his features—\nentered the kitchen.\nKelsier checked the clock. “You’re early, Saze.”\n“I try to make it a habit, Master Kelsier,” the Terrisman replied.\nDockson raised an eyebrow. “That’s a habit someone else could afford to\npick up.”\nKelsier snorted. “If you’re always on time, it implies that you never have\nanything better you should be doing.

There are two thousand men left from our army; I want you to get\nthem into Luthadel.”\nDockson nodded thoughtfully. “We’ll find a way.”\n“You want us to keep training them?” Ham asked.\nKelsier nodded.\n“Then we’ll have to hide them in squads,” he said. “We don’t have the\nresources to train men individually.

With that many men in town,\nthere’s a chance some of them will eventually get taken by the obligators\nfor one reason or another.”\nKelsier nodded. “Tell each group that it’s the only one that didn’t get\ndisbanded, and that it’s being retained just in case it’s needed at some point\nin the future.”\n“You also said that recruitment needed to be continued,” Ham said.\nKelsier nodded. “I’d like at least twice as many troops before we try and\npull this off.”\n“That’s going to be tough,” Ham said, “considering our army’s failure.”\n“What failure?” Kelsier asked. “Tell them the truth—that our army\nsuccessfully neutralized the Garrison.”\n“Though most of them died doing it,” Ham said.\n“We can gloss over that part,” Breeze said. “The people will be angry at\nthe executions—that should make them more willing to listen to us.”\n“Gathering more troops is going to be your main task over the next few\nmonths, Ham,” Kelsier said.\n“That’s not much time,” Ham said. “But, I’ll see what I can do.”\n“Good,” Kelsier said. “Saze, did the note come?”\n“It did, Master Kelsier,” Sazed said, pulling a letter from beneath his\ncloak and handing it to Kelsier.\n“And what would that be?” Breeze asked curiously.\n“A message from Marsh,” Kelsier said, opening the letter and scanning\nits contents. “He’s in the city, and he has news.”\n“What news?” Ham asked.\n“He doesn’t say,” Kelsier said, grabbing a baywrap. “But he gave\ninstructions on where to meet him tonight.” He walked over, picking up a\nregular skaa cloak. “I’m going to go scout the location before it gets dark.\nComing, Vin?”\nShe nodded, standing.\n“The rest of you keep working on the plan,” Kelsier said. “In two\nmonths’ time, I want this city to be so tense that when it finally breaks, even\nthe Lord Ruler won’t be able to hold it together.”\n“There’s something you’re not telling us, isn’t there?” Vin said, looking\naway from the window, turning toward Kelsier. “A part of the plan.”"

        "text": "“There’s something you’re not telling us, isn’t there?” Vin said, looking\naway from the window, turning toward Kelsier. “A part of the plan.”\nKelsier glanced over at her in the darkness. Marsh’s chosen meeting\nplace was an abandoned building within the Twists, one of the most\nimpoverished skaa slums. Kelsier had located a second abandoned building\nacross from the one they would meet in, and he and Vin waited on the top\nfloor, watching the street for signs of Marsh.\n“Why do you ask me that?” Kelsier finally said.\n“Because of the Lord Ruler,” Vin said, picking at the rotting wood of her\nwindowsill. “I felt his power today. I don’t think the others could sense it,\nnot like a Mistborn can. But I know you must have.” She looked up again,\nmeeting Kelsier’s eyes. “You’re still planning to get him out of the city\nbefore we try to take the palace, right?”\n“Don’t worry about the Lord Ruler,” Kelsier said. “The Eleventh Metal\nwill take care of him.”\nVin frowned. Outside, the sun was setting in a fiery blaze of frustration.\nThe mists would come soon, and supposedly Marsh would arrive a short\ntime later.\nThe Eleventh Metal, she thought, remembering the skepticism with which\nthe other crewmembers regarded it. “Is it real?” Vin asked.\n“The Eleventh Metal? Of course it is—I showed it to you, remember?”\n“That’s not what I mean,” she said. “Are the legends real? Are you\nlying?”\nKelsier turned toward her, frowning slightly. Then he smirked. “You’re a\nvery blunt girl, Vin.”\n“I know.”\nKelsier’s smile deepened. “The answer is no. I’m not lying. The legends\nare real, though it took some time for me to find them.”\n“And that bit of metal you showed us really is the Eleventh Metal?”\n“I think so,” Kelsier said.\n“But you don’t know how to use it.”\nKelsier paused, then shook his head. “No. I don’t.”\n“That’s not very comforting.”\nKelsier shrugged, turning to look out the window. “Even if I don’t\ndiscover the secret in time, I doubt the Lord Ruler will be as big a problem\nas you think. He’s a powerful Allomancer, but he doesn’t know everything\n—if he did, we’d be dead right now. He’s not omnipotent, either—if he\nwere, he wouldn’t have needed to execute all of those skaa to try and\nfrighten the city into submission.\n“I don’t know what he is—but I think he’s more like a man than he is a\ngod. The words in that logbook . . . they’re the words of a regular person.\nHis real power comes from his armies and his wealth. If we remove them,\nhe won’t be able to do anything to stop his empire from collapsing.”\nVin frowned. “He might not be a god, but . . . he’s something, Kelsier.\nSomething different. Today, when he was in the square, I could feel his\ntouch on my emotions even when I was burning copper.”\n“That’s not possible, Vin,” Kelsier said with a shake of his head. “If it"

        "text": "touch on my emotions even when I was burning copper.”\n“That’s not possible, Vin,” Kelsier said with a shake of his head. “If it\nwere, Inquisitors would be able to sense Allomancy even when there was a\nSmoker nearby. If that were the case, don’t you think they’d hunt down all\nof the skaa Mistings and kill them?”\nVin shrugged.\n“You know the Lord Ruler is strong,” Kelsier said, “and you feel like you\nshould still be able to sense him. So you do.”\nMaybe he’s right, she thought, picking off another bit of the windowsill.\nHe’s been an Allomancer for far longer than I have, after all.\nBut . . . I felt something, didn’t I? And the Inquisitor that nearly killed me\n—somehow, he found me in the darkness and rain. He must have sensed\nsomething.\nShe let the matter drop, however. “The Eleventh Metal. Couldn’t we just\ntry it and see what it does?”\n“It’s not that simple,” Kelsier said. “You remember how I told you never\nto burn a metal that wasn’t one of the ten?”\nVin nodded.\n“Burning another metal can be deadly,” Kelsier said. “Even getting the\nwrong mixture in an alloy metal can make you sick. If I’m wrong about the\nEleventh Metal . . .”\n“It will kill you,” Vin said quietly.\nKelsier nodded.\nSo, you’re not quite as certain as you pretend, she decided. Otherwise,\nyou’d have tried it by now.\n“That’s what you want to find in the logbook,” Vin said. “A clue about\nhow to use the Eleventh Metal.”\nKelsier nodded. “I’m afraid we weren’t very lucky in that respect. So far,\nthe logbook hasn’t even mentioned Allomancy.”\n“Though it does talk about Feruchemy,” Vin said.\nKelsier eyed her as he stood by his window, one shoulder leaning against\nthe wall. “So Sazed told you about that?”\nVin glanced down. “I . . . kind of forced him to.”\nKelsier chuckled. “I wonder what I’ve unleashed upon the world by\nteaching you Allomancy. Of course, my trainer said the same thing about\nme.”\n“He was right to worry.”\n“Of course he was.”\nVin smiled. Outside, the sunlight was nearly gone, and diaphanous\npatches of mist were beginning to form in the air. They hung like ghosts,\nslowly growing larger, extending their influence as night approached.\n“Sazed didn’t have time to tell me much about Feruchemy,” Vin said\ncarefully. “What kind of things can it do?” She waited in trepidation,\nassuming that Kelsier would see through her lie.\n“Feruchemy is completely internal,” Kelsier said in an offhand voice. “It\ncan provide some of the same things we get from pewter and tin—strength,\nendurance, eyesight—but each attribute has to be stored separately. It can\nenhance a lot of other things too—things that Allomancy can’t do. Memory,\nphysical speed, clarity of thought . . . even some strange things, like\nphysical weight or physical age, can be altered by Feruchemy.”"

        "text": "physical speed, clarity of thought . . . even some strange things, like\nphysical weight or physical age, can be altered by Feruchemy.”\n“So, it’s more powerful than Allomancy?” Vin said.\nKelsier shrugged. “Feruchemy doesn’t have any external powers—it\ncan’t Push and Pull emotions, nor can it Steelpush or Ironpull. And, the\nbiggest limitation to Feruchemy is that you have to store up all of its\nabilities by drawing them from your own body.\n“Want to be twice as strong for a time? Well, you have to spend several\nhours being weak to store up the strength. If you want to store up the ability\nto heal quickly, you have to spend a great deal of time feeling sick. In\nAllomancy, the metals themselves are our fuel—we can generally keep\ngoing as long as we have enough metal to burn. In Feruchemy, the metals\nare just storage devices—your own body is the real fuel.”\n“So, you just steal someone else’s storage metals, right?” Vin said.\nKelsier shook his head. “Doesn’t work—Feruchemists can only access\nmetal stores they themselves created.”\n“Oh.”\nKelsier nodded. “So, no. I wouldn’t say that Feruchemy is more powerful\nthan Allomancy. They both have advantages and limitations. For instance,\nan Allomancer can only flare a metal so high, and so his maximum strength\nis bounded. Feruchemists don’t have that kind of limitation; if a\nFeruchemist had enough strength stored up to be twice as strong as normal\nfor an hour, he could choose instead to be three times as strong for a shorter\nperiod of time—or even four, five, or six times as strong for even shorter\nperiods.”\nVin frowned. “That sounds like a pretty big advantage.”\n“True,” Kelsier said, reaching inside of his cloak and pulling out a vial\ncontaining several beads of atium. “But we have this. It doesn’t matter if a\nFeruchemist is as strong as five men or as strong as fifty men—if I know\nwhat he’s going to do next, I’ll beat him.”\nVin nodded.\n“Here,” Kelsier said, unstoppering the vial and pulling out one of the\nbeads. He took out another vial, this one filled with the normal alcohol\nsolution, and dropped the bead in it. “Take one of these. You might need it.”\n“Tonight?” Vin asked, accepting the vial.\nKelsier nodded.\n“But, it’s just Marsh.”\n“It might be,” he said. “Then again, maybe the obligators caught him and\nforced him to write that letter. Maybe they’re following him, or maybe\nthey’ve since captured him and have tortured him to find out about the\nmeeting. Marsh is in a very dangerous place—think about trying to do the\nsame thing you’re doing at those balls, except exchange all the noblemen\nfor obligators and Inquisitors.”\nVin shivered. “I guess you have a point,” she said, tucking away the bead\nof atium. “You know, something must be wrong with me—I barely even\nstop to think how much this stuff is worth anymore.”\nKelsier didn’t respond immediately. “I have trouble forgetting how much\nit’s worth,” he said quietly."

He usually wore long-\nsleeved shirts and gloves now; his reputation was making it dangerous for\nhis identifying scars to be visible in public. Vin knew they were there,\nhowever. Like thousands of tiny white scratches, layered one over the other.\n“Anyway,” Kelsier said, “you’re right about the logbook—I had hoped\nthat it would mention the Eleventh Metal. But, Allomancy isn’t even\nmentioned in reference to Feruchemy. The two powers are similar in many\nrespects; you’d think that he would compare them.”\n“Maybe he worried that someone would read the book, and didn’t want\nto give away that he was an Allomancer.”\nKelsier nodded. “Maybe. It’s also possible that he hadn’t Snapped yet.\nWhatever happened in those Terris Mountains changed him from hero to\ntyrant; maybe it also awakened his powers. We won’t know, I guess, until\nSaze finishes his translation.”\n“Is he close?”\nKelsier nodded. “Just a bit left—the important bit, hopefully. I feel a little\nfrustrated with the text so far. The Lord Ruler hasn’t even told us what he is\nsupposed to accomplish in those mountains! He claims that he’s doing\nsomething to protect the entire world, but that might just be his ego coming\nthrough.”\nHe didn’t seem very egotistical in the text to me, Vin thought. Kind of the\nopposite, actually.\n“Regardless,” Kelsier said, “we’ll know more once the last few sections\nare translated.”\nIt was growing dark outside, and Vin had to turn up her tin to see\nproperly. The street outside her window grew visible, adopting the strange\nmixture of shadow and luminance that was the result of tin-enhanced\nvision. She knew it was dark, logically. Yet, she could still see. Not as she\ndid in regular light—everything was muted—but it was sight nonetheless.\nKelsier checked his pocket watch.\n“How long?” Vin asked.\n“Another half hour,” Kelsier said. “Assuming he’s on time—and I doubt\nhe will be. He is my brother, after all.”\nVin nodded, shifting so that she leaned with arms crossed across the\nbroken windowsill. Though it was a very small thing, she felt a comfort in\nhaving the atium Kelsier had given her.\nShe paused. Thinking of atium reminded her of something important.\nSomething she’d been bothered by on several occasions. “You never taught\nme the ninth metal!” she accused, turning.\nKelsier shrugged. “I told you that it wasn’t very important.”\n“Still. What is it? Some alloy of atium, I assume?”\nKelsier shook his head. “No, the last two metals don’t follow the same\npattern as the basic eight. The ninth metal is gold.”\n“Gold?” Vin asked. “That’s it? I could have tried it a long time ago on my\nown!”\nKelsier chuckled. “Assuming you wanted to. Burning gold is a\nsomewhat. . . . uncomfortable experience.”"

We’ll\nsee, she thought.\n“You’re going to try it anyway, aren’t you?” Kelsier said, smiling.\nVin didn’t respond.\nKelsier sighed, reaching into his sash and pulling out a golden boxing\nand a file. “You should probably get one of these,” he said, holding up the\nfile. “However, if you collect a metal yourself, burn just a tiny bit first to\nmake certain that it’s pure or alloyed correctly.”\n“If it isn’t?” Vin asked.\n“You’ll know,” Kelsier promised, beginning to file away at the coin.\n“Remember that headache you had from pewter dragging?”\n“Yes?”\n“Bad metal is worse,” Kelsier said. “Far worse. Buy your metals when\nyou can—in every city, you’ll find a small group of merchants who provide\npowdered metals to Allomancers. Those merchants have a vested interest in\nmaking certain that all of their metals are pure—a grumpy Mistborn with a\nheadache isn’t exactly the kind of slighted customer one wants to deal\nwith.” Kelsier finished filing, then collected a few flakes of gold on a small\nsquare of cloth. He stuck one on his finger, then swallowed it.\n“This is good,” he said, handing her the cloth. “Go ahead—just\nremember, burning the ninth metal is a strange experience.”\nVin nodded, suddenly feeling a bit apprehensive. You’ll never know if you\ndon’t try it for yourself, she thought, then dumped the dustlike flakes into\nher mouth. She washed them down with a bit of water from her flask.\nA new metal reserve appeared within her—unfamiliar and different from\nthe nine she knew. She looked up at Kelsier, took a breath, and burned gold.\nShe was in two places at once. She could see herself, and she could see\nherself.\nOne of her was a strange woman, changed and transformed from the girl\nshe had always been. That girl had been careful and cautious—a girl who\nwould never burn an unfamiliar metal based solely on the word of one man.\nThis woman was foolish; she had forgotten many of the things that had let\nher survive so long. She drank from cups prepared by others. She\nfraternized with strangers. She didn’t keep track of the people around her.\nShe was still far more careful than most people, but she had lost so much.\nThe other her was something she had always secretly loathed. A child,\nreally. Thin to the point of scrawniness, she was lonely, hateful, and\nuntrusting. She loved no one, and no one loved her. She always told herself,\nquietly, that she didn’t care. Was there something worth living for? There\nhad to be. Life couldn’t be as pathetic as it seemed. Yet, it had to be. There\nwasn’t anything else.\nVin was both. She stood in two places, moving both bodies, being both\ngirl and woman. She reached out with hesitant, uncertain hands—one each\n—and touched herself on the faces, one each.\nVin gasped, and it was gone. She felt a sudden rush of emotions, a sense"

She felt a sudden rush of emotions, a sense\nof worthlessness and confusion. There were no chairs in the room, so she\nsimply squatted to the ground, sitting with her back to the wall, knees\npulled up, arms wrapped around them.\nKelsier walked over, squatting down to lay a hand on her shoulder. “It’s\nall right.”\n“What was that?” she whispered.\n“Gold and atium are complements, like the other metal pairs,” Kelsier\nsaid. “Atium lets you see, marginally, into the future. Gold works in a\nsimilar way, but it lets you see into the past. Or, at least, it gives you a\nglimpse of another version of yourself, had things been different in the\npast.”\nVin shivered. The experience of being both people at once, of seeing\nherself twice over, had been disturbingly eerie. Her body still shook, and\nher mind didn’t feel . . . right anymore.\nFortunately, the sensation seemed to be fading. “Remind me to listen to\nyou in the future,” she said. “Or, at least, when you talk about Allomancy.”\nKelsier chuckled. “I tried to put it out of your mind for as long as\npossible. But, you had to try it sometime. You’ll get over it.”\nVin nodded. “It’s . . . almost gone already. But, it wasn’t just a vision,\nKelsier. It was real. I could touch her, the other me.”\n“It may feel that way,” Kelsier said. “But she wasn’t here—I couldn’t see\nher, at least. It’s an hallucination.”\n“Atium visions aren’t just hallucinations,” Vin said. “The shadows really\ndo show what people will do.”\n“True,” Kelsier said. “I don’t know. Gold is strange, Vin. I don’t think\nanybody understands it. My trainer, Gemmel, said that a gold shadow was a\nperson who didn’t exist—but could have. A person you might have become,\nhad you not made certain choices. Of course, Gemmel was a bit screwy, so\nI’m not sure how much I’d believe of what he said.”\nVin nodded. However, it was unlikely that she’d find out more about gold\nanytime soon. She didn’t intend to ever burn it again, if she could help it.\nShe continued to sit, letting her emotions recover for a while, and Kelsier\nmoved back over by the window. Eventually, he perked up.\n“He’s here?” Vin asked, crawling to her feet.\nKelsier nodded. “You want to stay here and rest some more?”\nVin shook her head.\n“All right, then,” he said, placing his pocket watch, file, and other metals\non the windowsill. “Let’s go.”\nThey didn’t go out the window—Kelsier wanted to maintain a low\nprofile, though this section of the Twists was so deserted that Vin wasn’t\nsure why he bothered.

The front door was gone, though Vin\ncould see remnants of it in the splintered refuse on the floor. The room\ninside smelled of dust and soot, and she had to stifle a sneeze.\nA figure standing on the far side of the room spun at the sound. “Kell?”\n“It’s me,” Kelsier said. “And Vin.”\nAs Vin drew closer, she could see Marsh squinting in the darkness. It was\nodd to watch him, feeling like she was in plain sight, yet knowing that to\nhim she and Kelsier were nothing more than shadows. The far wall of the\nbuilding had collapsed, and mist floated freely in the room, nearly as dense\nas it was outside.\n“You have Ministry tattoos!” Vin said, staring at Marsh.\n“Of course,” Marsh said, his voice as stern as ever. “I had them put on\nbefore I met up with the caravan. I had to have them to play the part of an\nacolyte.”\nThey weren’t extensive—he was playing a low-ranked obligator—but the\npattern was unmistakable. Dark lines, rimming the eyes, running outward\nlike crawling cracks of lightning. There was one, single line—much thicker,\nand in bright red, running down the side of his face. Vin recognized the\npattern: These were the lines of an obligator who belonged to the Canton of\nInquisition. Marsh hadn’t just infiltrated the Ministry, he’d chosen the most\ndangerous section of it to infiltrate.\n“But, you’ll always have them,” Vin said. “They’re so distinctive—\neverywhere you go, you’ll be known as either an obligator or a fraud.”\n“That was part of the price he paid to infiltrate the Ministry, Vin,” Kelsier\nsaid quietly.\n“It doesn’t matter,” Marsh said. “I didn’t have much of a life before this\nanyway. Look, can we hurry? I’m expected to be somewhere soon.\nObligators lead busy lives, and I only have a few minutes’ leeway.”\n“All right,” Kelsier said. “I assume your infiltration went well, then?”\n“It went fine,” Marsh said tersely. “Too well, actually—I think I might\nhave distinguished myself from the group. I assumed that I would be at a\ndisadvantage, since I didn’t have the same five years of training that the\nother acolytes did. I made certain to answer questions as thoroughly as\npossible, and to perform my duties with precision. However, I apparently\nknow more about the Ministry than even some of its members do. I’m\ncertainly more competent than this batch of newcomers, and the prelans\nhave noticed that.”\nKelsier chuckled. “You always were an overachiever.”\nMarsh snorted quietly. “Anyway, my knowledge—not to mention my\nskill as a Seeker—has already earned me an outstanding reputation. I’m not\nsure how closely I want the prelans paying attention to me; that background\nwe devised begins to sound a bit flimsy when an Inquisitor is grilling you.”\nVin frowned. “You told them that you’re a Misting?”"

The fact that I’m one is\nenough to keep them from asking too many questions about my\nbackground. They’re happy enough to have me, despite the fact that I’m a\nfair bit older than most acolytes.”\n“Besides,” Kelsier said, “he needed to tell them he was a Misting so that\nhe could get into the more secretive Ministry sects. Most of the higher-\nranking obligators are Mistings of one sort or another. They tend to favor\ntheir own kind.”\n“With good reason,” Marsh said, speaking quickly. “Kell, the Ministry is\nfar more competent than we assumed.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“They make use of their Mistings,” Marsh said. “Good use of them. They\nhave bases throughout the city—Soothing stations, as they call them. Each\none contains a couple of Ministry Soothers whose only duty is to extend a\ndampening influence around them, calming and depressing the emotions of\neveryone in the area.”\nKelsier hissed quietly. “How many?”\n“Dozens,” Marsh said. “Concentrated in skaa sections of the city. They\nknow that the skaa are beaten, but they want to make sure things stay that\nway.”\n“Bloody hell!” Kelsier said. “I always thought that the skaa inside\nLuthadel seemed more beaten down than others. No wonder we had so\nmuch trouble recruiting. The people’s emotions are under a constant\nSoothing!”\nMarsh nodded. “The Ministry Soothers are good, Kell—very good. Even\nbetter than Breeze. All they do is Soothe all day, every day. And, since\nthey’re not trying to get you to do anything specific—instead just keeping\nyou from extreme emotional ranges—they’re very hard to notice.\n“Each team has a Smoker to keep them hidden, as well as a Seeker to\nwatch for passing Allomancers. I’ll bet this is where the Inquisitors get a lot\nof their leads—most of our people are smart enough not to burn when they\nknow that there’s an obligator in the area, but they’re more lax in the\nslums.”\n“Can you get us a list of the stations?” Kelsier asked. “We need to know\nwhere those Seekers are, Marsh.”\nMarsh nodded. “I’ll try. I’m on my way to a station right now—they\nalways do personnel changes at night, to maintain their secret. The upper\nranks have taken an interest in me, and they’re letting me visit some\nstations to become familiar with their work. I’ll see if I can get a list for\nyou.”\nKelsier nodded in the darkness.\n“Just . . . don’t be stupid with the information, all right?” Marsh said.\n“We have to be careful, Kell. The Ministry has kept these stations secret for\nquite some time. Now that we know about them, we have a serious\nadvantage. Don’t waste it.”\n“I won’t,” Kelsier promised. “What about the Inquisitors? Did you find\nanything out about them?”"

They seem to have all of the Allomantic powers, so I assume that\nthey were once Mistborn. I can’t find out much else about them—though I\ndo know that they age.”\n“Really?” Kelsier said with interest. “So, they’re not immortal?”\n“No,” Marsh said. “The obligators say that Inquisitors change\noccasionally. The creatures are very long-lived, but they do eventually die\nof old age. New ones must be recruited from noblemen ranks. They’re\npeople, Kell—they’ve just been . . . changed.”\nKelsier nodded. “If they can die of old age, then there’s probably other\nways to kill them too.”\n“That’s what I think,” Marsh said. “I’ll see what I can find, but don’t get\nyour hopes up. The Inquisitors don’t have many dealings with normal\nobligators—there’s political tension between the two groups. The lord\nprelan leads the church, but the Inquisitors think that they should be in\ncharge.”\n“Interesting,” Kelsier said slowly. Vin could practically hear his mind\nworking on the new information.\n“Anyway, I should go,” Marsh said. “I had to jog all the way here, and\nI’m going to be late getting to my appointment anyway.”\nKelsier nodded, and Marsh began to move away, picking his way over\nthe rubble in his dark obligator’s robe.\n“Marsh,” Kelsier said as Marsh reached the doorway.\nMarsh turned.\n“Thank you,” Kelsier said. “I can only guess how dangerous this is.”\n“I’m not doing this for you, Kell,” Marsh said. “But . . . I appreciate the\nsentiment. I’ll try and send you another missive once I have more\ninformation.”\n“Be careful,” Kelsier said.\nMarsh vanished out into the misty night. Kelsier stood in the fallen room\nfor a few minutes, staring after his brother.\nHe wasn’t lying about that either, Vin thought. He really does care for\nMarsh.\n“Let’s go,” Kelsier said. “We should get you back to Mansion Renoux—\nHouse Lekal is throwing another party in a few days, and you’ll need to be\nthere.”\nSometimes, my companions claim that I worry and question too much. However, while I may wonder about my stature as the hero, there is one thing that I have never\nquestioned: the ultimate good of our quest.\nThe Deepness must be destroyed. I have seen it, and I have felt it. This name we give it is too weak a word, I think. Yes, it is deep and unfathomable, but it is also\nterrible. Many do not realize that it is sentient, but I have sensed its mind, such that it is, the few times I have confronted it directly.\nIt is a thing of destruction, madness, and corruption. It would destroy this world not out of spite or out of animosity, but simply because that is what it does.\n28\nK L like the inside of a pyramid. The dance floor was set"

        "text": "28\nK L like the inside of a pyramid. The dance floor was set\nEEP EKAL’S BALLROOM WAS SHAPED\non a waist-high platform at the very center of the room, and the dining\ntables sat on four similar platforms surrounding it. Servants scuttled through\nthe trenches running between the platforms, delivering food to the dining\naristocrats.\nFour tiers of balconies ran along the inside perimeter of the pyramidal\nroom, each one a little closer to the point at the top, each one extending just\na little bit more over the dance floor. Though the main room was well lit,\nthe balconies themselves were shadowed by their overhangs. The design\nwas intended to allow proper viewing of the keep’s most distinctive artistic\nfeature—the small stained-glass windows that lined each balcony.\nLekal noblemen bragged that while other keeps had larger windows,\nKeep Lekal had the most detailed ones. Vin had to admit that they were\nimpressive. She’d seen so many stained-glass windows over the last few\nmonths that she was beginning to take them for granted. Keep Lekal’s\nwindows, however, put most of them to shame. Each of these was an\nextravagant, detailed marvel of resplendent color. Exotic animals pranced,\ndistant landscapes enticed, and portraits of famous noblemen sat proudly.\nThere were also, of course, the requisite pictures dedicated to the\nAscension. Vin could recognize these more easily now, and she was\nsurprised to see references to things she had read in the logbook. The hills\nof emerald green. The steep mountains, with faint wavelike lines coming\nfrom the tips. A deep, dark lake. And . . . blackness. The Deepness. A\nchaotic thing of destruction.\nHe defeated it, Vin thought. But . . . what was it? Perhaps the end of the\nlogbook would reveal more.\nVin shook her head, leaving the alcove—and its black window—behind.\nShe strolled along the second balcony, wearing a pure white gown—an\noutfit she would never have been able to even imagine during her life as a\nskaa. Ash and soot had been too much a part of her life, and she didn’t think\nshe’d even had a concept of what a pristine white looked like. That\nknowledge made the dress even more wondrous to her. She hoped she\nwould never lose that—the sense within herself of how life had been before.\nIt made her appreciate what she had so much more than the real nobility\nseemed to.\nShe continued along the balcony, seeking her prey. Glittering colors\nshone from backlit windows, sparkling light across the floor. Most of the\nwindows glowed inside small viewing alcoves along the balcony, and so the\nbalcony before her was interspersed with pockets of dark and color. Vin\ndidn’t stop to study any more of the windows; she’d done quite a bit of that\nduring her first balls at Keep Lekal. This night she had business to attend to.\nShe found her quarry halfway down the east balcony walkway. Lady\nKliss was speaking with a group of people, so Vin paused, pretending to\nstudy a window. Kliss’s group soon broke up—one could generally only\ntake so much of Kliss at a time. The short woman began to walk along the\nbalcony toward Vin."

The short woman began to walk along the\nbalcony toward Vin.\nWhen she drew close, Vin turned, as if in surprise. “Why, Lady Kliss! I\nhaven’t seen you all evening.”\nKliss turned eagerly, obviously excited by the prospect of another person\nwith whom to gossip. “Lady Valette!” she said, waddling forward. “You\nmissed Lord Cabe’s ball last week! Not due to a relapse of your earlier\nmalady, I hope?”\n“No,” Vin said. “I spent that evening dining with my uncle.”\n“Oh,” Kliss said, disappointed. A relapse would have made a better story.\n“Well, that’s good.”\n“I hear you have some interesting news about Lady Tren-Pedri Delouse,”\nVin said carefully. “I myself have heard some interesting things lately.” She\neyed Kliss, implying that she’d be willing to trade tidbits.\n“Oh, that!” Kliss said eagerly. “Well, I heard that Tren-Pedri isn’t at all\ninterested in a union with House Aime, though her father is implying that\nthere will be a wedding soon. You know how the Aime sons are, though.\nWhy, Fedren is an absolute buffoon.”\nInwardly, Vin rolled her eyes. Kliss just kept on talking, not even\nnoticing that Vin had something she herself wanted to share. Using subtlety\non this woman is about as effective as trying to sell bathwater perfumes to a\nplantation skaa.\n“That is interesting,” Vin said, interrupting Kliss. “Perhaps Tren-Pedri’s\nhesitance comes because of House Aime’s connection to House Hasting.”\nKliss paused. “Why would that be?”\n“Well, we all know what House Hasting is planning.”\n“We do?” Kliss asked.\nVin pretended to look embarrassed. “Oh. Perhaps that isn’t known yet.\nPlease, Lady Kliss, forget that I said anything.”\n“Forget?” Kliss said. “Why, it’s already forgotten. But, come now, you\ncan’t just stop. What do you mean?”\n“I shouldn’t say,” Vin said. “It’s just something I overheard my uncle\ntalking about.”\n“Your uncle?” Kliss asked, growing more eager. “What did he say? You\nknow that you can trust me.”\n“Well . . .” Vin said. “He said that House Hasting was relocating a lot of\nresources back to its plantations in the Southern Dominance. My uncle was\nquite happy—Hasting has withdrawn from some of its contracts, and my\nuncle was hoping to get them instead.”\n“Relocating . . .” Kliss said. “Why, they wouldn’t do that unless they\nwere planning to withdraw from the city. . . .”\n“Could you blame them?” Vin asked quietly. “I mean, who wants to risk\nwhat happened to House Tekiel?”\n“Who indeed . . .” Kliss said. She was practically shaking with eagerness\nto go share the news.\n“Anyway, please, this is obviously only hearsay,” Vin said. “You\nprobably shouldn’t tell anyone about it.”\n“Of course,” Kliss said. “Um . . . excuse me. I need to go refresh\nmyself.”"

I need to go refresh\nmyself.”\n“Of course,” Vin said, watching the woman zip away toward the balcony\nstairs.\nVin smiled. House Hasting was making no such preparations, of course;\nHasting was one of the strongest families in the city, and wouldn’t likely\nwithdraw. However, Dockson was back at the shop forging documents\nwhich, when delivered to the right places, would imply that Hasting was\nplanning to do what Vin had said.\nIf all went well, the entire city would soon expect a Hasting withdrawal.\nTheir allies would plan for it, and might even begin to withdraw\nthemselves. People seeking to buy weapons would instead look to other\nplaces, fearing that Hasting wouldn’t be able to make good on contracts\nonce it left. When Hasting didn’t withdraw, it would make them look\nindecisive. Their allies gone, their income weakened, they could very well\nbe the next house to fall.\nHouse Hasting, however, was one of the easy ones to work against. It had\na reputation for extreme subterfuge, and people would believe that it was\nplanning a secret retreat. In addition, Hasting was a strong mercantile house\n—meaning it depended a great deal upon its contracts to survive. A house\nwith such an obvious, dominating source of income also had an obvious\nweakness. Lord Hasting had worked hard to increase his house’s influence\nover the last few decades, and in doing so he had extended his house’s\nresources to their limits.\nOther houses were far more stable. Vin sighed, turning and strolling\ndown the walkway, eyeing the massive clock set between the balconies on\nthe other side of the chamber.\nVenture would not fall easily. It remained powerful through the sheer\nforce of fortune; though it participated in some contracts, it didn’t rely on\nthem like other houses. Venture was rich enough, and powerful enough, that\neven mercantile disaster would only jostle it.\nIn a way, Venture’s stability was a good thing—for Vin, at least. The\nhouse had no obvious weaknesses, so maybe the crew wouldn’t be too\ndisappointed when she couldn’t discover any way to bring it down. After\nall, they didn’t absolutely need to destroy House Venture; doing so would\nsimply make the plan go more smoothly.\nWhatever happened, Vin had to make sure that Venture didn’t suffer the\nsame fate as House Tekiel. Their reputation destroyed, their finances\nunhinged, the Tekiel had tried to pull out of the city—and this final show of\nweakness had been too much. Some of Tekiel’s nobility had been\nassassinated before they left; the rest had been found in the burned-out ruins\nof their canal boats, apparently hit by bandits. Vin, however, knew of no\nthieving band who would dare slaughter so many noblemen.\nKelsier still hadn’t been able to discover which house was behind the\nmurders, but the Luthadel nobility didn’t seem to care who the culprit was.\nHouse Tekiel had allowed itself to grow weak, and nothing was more\nembarrassing to the aristocracy than a Great House that couldn’t maintain\nitself.

Kelsier had been right: Though polite groups met at balls, the nobility\nwere more than willing to stab each other square in the chest if it benefited\nthem.\nKind of like thieving crews, she thought. The nobility really aren’t that\ndifferent from the people I grew up around.\nThe atmosphere was only made more dangerous by its polite niceties.\nUnderneath that front were plots, assassinations, and—perhaps most\nimportantly—Mistborn. It was no accident that all of the balls she had\nattended recently had displayed great numbers of guards, both wearing\narmor and not. The parties now served the additional purpose of warning\nand showing strength.\nElend is safe, she told herself. Despite what he thinks of his family,\nthey’ve done a good job of maintaining their place in the Luthadel\nhierarchy. He’s the heir—they’ll protect him from assassins.\nShe wished those assertions sounded just a bit more convincing. She\nknew that Shan Elariel was planning something. House Venture might be\nsafe, but Elend himself was a little bit . . . oblivious sometimes. If Shan did\nsomething against him personally, it might or might not be a major blow\nagainst House Venture—but it would certainly be a major blow against Vin.\n“Lady Valette Renoux,” a voice said. “I do believe that you’re late.”\nVin turned to see Elend lounging in an alcove to her left. She smiled,\nglancing down at the clock, noticing that it was indeed a few minutes past\nthe time when she had promised to meet him. “I must be picking up bad\nhabits from some friends of mine,” she said, stepping into the alcove.\n“Now, see, I didn’t say it was a bad thing,” Elend said, smiling. “Why,\nI’d say that it is a lady’s courtly duty to be a bit dilatory. It does gentlemen\ngood to be forced to wait upon a woman’s whims—or, so my mother was\nalways fond of telling me.”\n“It sounds like she was a wise woman,” Vin said. The alcove was just\nlarge enough for two people standing sideways. She stood across from him,\nthe balcony overhang a short distance to her left, a marvelous lavender\nwindow to her right, their feet nearly touching.\n“Oh, I don’t know about that,” Elend said. “She married my father, after\nall.”\n“Thereby joining the most powerful house in the Final Empire. You can’t\ndo much better than that—though, I suppose she could have tried to marry\nthe Lord Ruler. Last I knew, though, he wasn’t in the market for a wife.”\n“Pity,” Elend said. “Maybe he’d look a little less depressed if there were\na woman in his life.”\n“I guess that would depend on the woman.” Vin glanced to the side as a\nsmall group of courtgoers strolled past. “You know, this isn’t exactly the\nmost private location. People are giving us odd looks.”\n“You’re the one who stepped in here with me,” Elend pointed out.\n“Yes, well, I wasn’t thinking about the gossip we might start.”\n“Let it start,” Elend said standing up straight.\n“Because it will make your father angry?”"

Vin could feel his\nbreath. He stood there for a moment before speaking. “I think I’m going to\nkiss you.”\nVin shivered slightly. “I don’t think you want to do that, Elend.”\n“Why?”\n“How much do you really know about me?”\n“Not as much as I’d like to,” he said.\n“Not as much as you need to, either,” Vin said, looking up into his eyes.\n“So tell me,” he said.\n“I can’t. Not right now.”\nElend stood for a moment, then nodded slightly and pulled away. He\nwalked out onto the balcony walkway. “So, shall we go for a stroll, then?”\n“Yes,” Vin said, relieved—yet just a bit disappointed as well.\n“It’s for the best,” Elend said. “That alcove has absolutely terrible\nreading light.”\n“Don’t you dare,” Vin said, eyeing the book in his pocket as she joined\nhim on the walkway. “Read when you’re with someone else, not me.”\n“But that’s how our relationship began!”\n“And that’s how it could end too,” Vin said, taking his arm.\nElend smiled. They weren’t the only couple walking the balcony, and\ndown below, other pairs spun slowly to the faint music.\nIt seems so peaceful. Yet, just a few days ago, many of these people stood\nand watched idly as women and children were beheaded.\nShe felt Elend’s arm, his warmth beside her. Kelsier said that he smiled\nso much because he felt he needed to take what joy he could in the world—\nto relish the moments of happiness that seemed so infrequent in the Final\nEmpire. Strolling for a time beside Elend, Vin thought she was beginning to\nunderstand how Kelsier felt.\n“Valette . . .” Elend said slowly.\n“What?”\n“I want you to leave Luthadel,” he said.\n“What?”\nHe paused, turning to look at her. “I’ve thought about this a lot. You may\nnot realize it, but the city is becoming dangerous. Very dangerous.”\n“I know.”\n“Then you know that a small house without allies has no place in the\nCentral Dominance right now,” Elend said. “Your uncle was brave to come\nhere and try to establish himself, but he chose the wrong time. I . . . I think\nthings are going to get out of hand here very soon. When that happens, I\ncan’t guarantee your safety.”\n“My uncle knows what he’s doing, Elend.”\n“This is different, Valette,” Elend said. “Entire houses are falling. The\nTekiel family wasn’t slaughtered by bandits—that was the work of House\nHasting. Those won’t be the last deaths we see before this is through.”\nVin paused, thinking of Shan again. “But . . . you’re safe, right? House\nVenture—it’s not like the others. It’s stable.”\nElend shook his head. “We’re even more vulnerable than the rest,\nValette.”"

However, with the Lord Ruler’s house taxings . . . well, the only way we\nmaintain so much power in this city is through income. Secret income.”\nVin frowned, and Elend leaned closer, speaking almost in a whisper. “My\nfamily mines the Lord Ruler’s atium, Valette,” he said. “That’s where our\nwealth comes from. In a way, our stability depends almost completely on\nthe Lord Ruler’s whims. He doesn’t like to bother collecting the atium\nhimself, but he gets very perturbed if the delivery schedule is disrupted.”\nFind out more! instinct told her. This is the secret; this is what Kelsier\nneeds. “Oh, Elend,” Vin whispered. “You shouldn’t be telling me this.”\n“Why not?” he said. “I trust you. Look, you need to understand how\ndangerous things are. The atium supply has been having some troubles\nlately. Ever since. . . . well, something happened a few years ago. Ever since\nthen, things have been different. My father can’t meet the Lord Ruler’s\nquotas, and last time that happened . . .”\n“What?”\n“Well,” Elend said, looking troubled. “Let’s just say that things could\nsoon grow very bad for the Ventures. The Lord Ruler depends on that\natium, Valette—it’s one of the prime ways he controls the nobility. A house\nwithout atium is a house that can’t defend itself from Mistborn. By keeping\na large reserve, the Lord Ruler controls the market, making himself\nextremely wealthy. He funds his armies by making atium scarce, then\nselling extra bits for lavish amounts. If you knew more about the economics\nof Allomancy, this would probably make a lot more sense to you.”\nOh, trust me. I understand more than you think. And now I know far more\nthan I should.\nElend paused, smiling pleasantly as an obligator strolled along the\nbalcony walkway beside them. The obligator looked them over as he\npassed, eyes thoughtful within their web of tattoos.\nElend turned back to her as soon as the obligator had passed. “I want you\nto leave,” he repeated. “People know that I’ve paid attention to you.\nHopefully, they’ll assume it was just to spite my father, but they could still\ntry to use you. The Great Houses wouldn’t have any qualms about crushing\nyour entire family just to get at me and my father. You have to go.”\n“I’ll . . . think about it,” Vin said.\n“There isn’t much time left for thinking,” Elend warned. “I want you to\nleave before you get too involved with what is going on in this city.”\nI’m already involved so much more than you think. “I said I’d think about\nit,” she said. “Look, Elend, I think you should be more worried about"

If things continue as they are, we might not have\nmany more opportunities like this for a while.”\nHe paused, then finally nodded. She could see he was still troubled, but\nhe did turn back to their walk, letting her gently take his arm again as they\nstrolled. They walked together for a time, silent until something drew Vin’s\nattention. She removed her hands from his arm, instead reaching down to\ntake his hand in her own.\nHe glanced at her, frowning in confusion as she tapped the ring on his\nfinger. “It really is metal,” she said, a bit surprised, despite what she’d been\ntold.\nElend nodded. “Pure gold.”\n“Don’t you worry about . . .”\n“Allomancers?” Elend asked. He shrugged. “I don’t know—they’re not\nthe sort of thing that I’ve ever had to deal with. You don’t wear metal, out\non the plantations?”\nVin shook her head, tapping one of the barrettes in her hair. “Painted\nwood,” she said.\nElend nodded. “Probably wise,” he said. “But, well, the longer you stay\nin Luthadel, the more you’ll realize that little we do here is done in the\nname of wisdom. The Lord Ruler wears metal rings—and so, therefore,\ndoes the nobility. Some philosophers think that’s all part of His plan. The\nLord Ruler wears metal because he knows that the nobility will mimic him,\nand therefore give his Inquisitors power over them.”\n“Do you agree?” Vin asked, taking his arm again as they walked. “With\nthe philosophers, I mean?”\nElend shook his head. “No,” he said in a quieter voice. “The Lord Ruler .\n. . he’s just arrogant. I’ve read of warriors, long ago, who would run into\nbattle without armor on, supposedly to prove how brave and strong they\nwere. That’s how this is, I think—though admittedly on a far more subtle\nlevel. He wears metal to flaunt his power, to show how unfrightened—how\nunthreatened—he is by anything we could do to him.”\nWell, Vin thought, he’s willing to call the Lord Ruler arrogant. Perhaps I\ncan get him to admit a little more. . . .\nElend paused, glancing over at the clock. “I’m afraid I don’t have a\nwhole lot of time tonight, Valette.”"

He simply raised an eyebrow in her\ndirection. “Indeed, I will. You’re very observant.”\n“It doesn’t take much observing,” Vin said. “Anytime we’re at Keeps\nHasting, Venture, Lekal, or Elariel, you run off with the same people.”\n“My drinking friends,” Elend said with a smile. “An unlikely group in\ntoday’s political climate, but one that helps annoy my father.”\n“What do you do at these meetings?” Vin asked.\n“We talk philosophy, mostly,” Elend said. “We’re kind of a stuffy lot—\nwhich isn’t too surprising, I guess, if you know any of us. We talk about the\ngovernment, about politics . . . about the Lord Ruler.”\n“What about him?”\n“Well, we don’t like some of the things he’s done with the Final Empire.”\n“So you do want to overthrow him!” Vin said.\nElend gave her a strange look. “Overthrow him?

We can’t do anything about\nhim being in charge.” He looked away as they continued to walk. “No, my\nfriends and I, we just . . . wish the Final Empire could be a little different.\nWe can’t change things now, but maybe someday—assuming we all survive\nthe next year or so—we’ll be in positions to influence the Lord Ruler.”\n“To do what?”\n“Well, take those executions a few days ago,” Elend said. “I don’t see\nthat they did any good. The skaa rebelled. In reprisal, the Ministry executed\na few hundred random people. What is that going to do besides make the\npopulace even more angry? So, next time the rebellion will be bigger. Does\nthat mean that the Lord Ruler will order more people beheaded? How long\ncan that continue before there just aren’t any skaa left?”\nVin walked thoughtfully. “And what would you do, Elend Venture?” she\nfinally said. “If you were in charge.”\n“I don’t know,” Elend confessed. “I’ve read a lot of books—some that\nI’m not supposed to—and I haven’t found any easy answers.

Who knows\n—considering all of your political maneuvering, maybe House Renoux will\nsoon be the power in town, and I’ll just be a lowly beggar.”\nVin smiled, and he bowed—winking at her—then was off toward the\nstairs. Vin walked slowly over to the balcony railing, looking down at the\npeople dancing and dining below.\nSo he’s not a revolutionary, she thought. Kelsier was right again. I\nwonder if he ever gets tired of that.\nBut still, she couldn’t feel too disappointed with Elend. Not everyone\nwas so insane that they’d think to overthrow their god-emperor. The mere\nfact that Elend was willing to think for himself set him apart from the rest;\nhe was a good man, one who deserved a woman who was worthy of his\ntrust.\nUnfortunately, he had Vin.\nSo House Venture secretly mines the Lord Ruler’s atium, she thought.\nThey must be the ones who administer the Pits of Hathsin.\nIt was a frighteningly precarious position for a house to be in—their\nfinances depended directly on pleasing the Lord Ruler. Elend thought that\nhe was being careful, but Vin was worried. He wasn’t taking Shan Elariel\nseriously enough—of that, Vin was certain. She turned, walking intently\nfrom the balcony and down to the main floor.\nShe found Shan’s table easily; the woman always sat with a large group\nof attendant noblewomen, presiding like a lord over his plantation. Vin\npaused. She’d never approached Shan directly. Someone, however, needed\nto protect Elend; he was obviously too foolish to do it himself.\nVin strode forward. Shan’s Terrisman studied Vin as she approached. He\nwas so different from Sazed—he didn’t have the same . . . spirit. This man\nmaintained a flat expression, like some creature carved of stone. A few of\nthe ladies shot disapproving glances toward Vin, but most of them—Shan\nincluded—ignored her.\nVin stood awkwardly beside the table, waiting for a lull in the\nconversation. There was none. Finally, she just took a few steps closer to\nShan.\n“Lady Shan?” she asked.\nShan turned with an icy glare. “I didn’t send for you, country girl.”\n“Yes, but I’ve found some books like you—”\n“I no longer require your services,” Shan said, turning away. “I can deal\nwith Elend Venture on my own. Now, be a good little twit and stop\nbothering me.”\nVin stood, stunned. “But, your plan—”\n“I said that you are no longer needed. You think I was harsh on you\nbefore, girl? That was when you were on my good side. Try annoying me\nnow.”\nVin wilted reflexively before the woman’s demeaning gaze. She seemed .\n. . disgusted. Angry, even.

        "text": "now.”\nVin wilted reflexively before the woman’s demeaning gaze. She seemed .\n. . disgusted. Angry, even. Jealous?\nShe must have figured it out, Vin thought. She finally realized out that I’m\nnot just playing with Elend. She knows that I care for him, and doesn’t trust\nme to keep her secrets.\nVin backed away from the table. Apparently, she would have to use other\nmethods to discover Shan’s plans.\nDespite what he often said, Elend Venture did not consider himself to be a\nrude man. He was more of a . . . verbal philosopher. He liked to test and\nturn conversation to see how people would react. Like the great thinkers of\nold, he pushed boundaries and experimented with unconventional methods.\nOf course, he thought, holding his cup of brandy up before his eyes,\ninspecting it musingly, most of those old philosophers were eventually\nexecuted for treason. Not exactly the most successful role models.\nHis evening political conversation with his group was finished, and he\nhad retired with several friends to Keep Lekal’s gentlemen’s lounge, a small\nchamber adjacent to the ballroom. It was furnished in deep green colors,\nand the chairs were comfortable; it would have been a nice place to read,\nhad he been in a slightly better mood. Jastes sat across from him, puffing\ncontentedly on his pipe. It was good to see the young Lekal looking so\ncalm. These last few weeks had been difficult for him.\nHouse war, Elend thought. What terrible timing. Why now? Things were\ngoing so well. . . .\nTelden returned with a refilled drink a few moments later.\n“You know,” Jastes said, gesturing with his pipe, “any one of the servants\nin here would have brought you a new drink.”\n“I felt like stretching my legs,” Telden said, settling into the third chair.\n“And you flirted with no less than three women on your way back,”\nJastes said. “I counted.”\nTelden smiled, sipping his drink. The large man never just “sat”—he\nlounged. Telden could look relaxed and comfortable no matter what the\nsituation, his sharp suits and well-styled hair enviably handsome.\nMaybe I should pay just a little more attention to things like that, Elend\nthought to himself. Valette suffers my hair the way it is, but would she like it\nbetter if I had it styled?\nElend often intended to make his way to a stylist or tailor, but other\nthings tended to steal his attention. He’d get lost in his studies or spend too\nlong reading, then find himself late for his appointments. Again.\n“Elend is quiet this evening,” Telden noticed. Though other groups of\ngentlemen sat in the dim lounge, the chairs were spread out enough to allow\nfor private conversations.\n“He’s been like that a lot, lately,” Jastes said.\n“Ah, yes,” Telden said, frowning slightly.\nElend knew them well enough to take the hint. “Now, see, why must\npeople be like this? If you have something to say, why not simply say it?”\n“Politics, my friend,” Jastes said. “We are—if you haven’t noticed—\nnoblemen.”\nElend rolled his eyes.\n“All right, I’ll say it,” Jastes replied, running his hand through his hair—a"

I’ve seen you flirt with half the serving girls in\nthe room.”\n“I’m not heir to my house,” Telden said.\n“And,” Jastes said, “these girls are trustworthy. My family hired these\nwomen—we know their houses, their backgrounds, and their allegiances.”\nElend frowned. “What are you implying?”\n“Something’s strange about that girl, Elend,” Jastes said. He’d gone back\nto his normal nervous self, his pipe sitting unnoticed in its holder on the\ntable.\nTelden nodded. “She got too close to you too quickly, Elend. She wants\nsomething.”\n“Like what?” Elend asked, growing annoyed.\n“Elend, Elend,” Jastes said. “You can’t just avoid the game by saying you\ndon’t want to play. It’ll find you. Renoux moved into town just as house\ntensions began to rise, and he brought with him an unknown scion—a girl\nwho immediately began to woo the most important and available young\nman in Luthadel. Doesn’t that seem odd to you?”\n“Actually,” Elend noted, “I approached her first—if only because she had\nstolen my reading spot.”\n“But, you have to admit that it’s suspicious how quickly she latched on to\nyou,” Telden said. “If you’re going to dabble with romance, Elend, you\nneed to learn one thing: You can play with women if you want, but don’t let\nyourself get too close to them. That’s where the trouble starts.”\nElend shook his head. “Valette is different.”\nThe other two shared a look, then Telden shrugged, turning back to his\ndrink. Jastes, however, sighed, then stood and stretched. “Anyway, I should\nprobably be going.”\n“One more drink,” Telden said.\nJastes shook his head, running a hand through his hair. “You know how\nmy parents are on ball nights—if I don’t go out and bid farewell to at least\nsome of the guests, I’ll be nagged about it for weeks.”\nThe younger man wished them good night, walking back toward the\nmain ballroom. Telden sipped his drink, eyeing Elend.\n“I’m not thinking about her,” Elend said testily.\n“What, then?”\n“The meeting tonight,” Elend said. “I’m not sure if I like how it went.”\n“Bah,” the large man said with a wave of his hand. “You’re getting as\nbad as Jastes. What happened to the man who attended these meetings just\nto relax and enjoy time with his friends?”\n“He’s worried,” Elend said. “Some of his friends might end up in charge\nof their houses sooner than he expected, and he’s worried that none of us\nare ready.”"

In a few months, we’ll look\nback and wonder what all the fretting was about.”\nKale Tekiel won’t look back, Elend thought.\nThe conversation waned, however, and Telden eventually excused\nhimself. Elend sat for a while longer, opening The Dictates of Society for\nanother read, but he had trouble concentrating. He turned the cup of brandy\nin his fingers, but didn’t drink much.\nI wonder if Valette’s out yet. . . . He’d tried to find her once his meeting\nwas over, but apparently she’d been in a private gathering of her own.\nThat girl, he thought lazily, is far too interested in politics for her own\ngood. Perhaps he was just jealous—only a few months in court, and she\nalready seemed to be more competent than he was. She was so fearless, so\nbold, so . . . interesting. She didn’t fit any of the courtly stereotypes he’d\nbeen taught to expect.\nCould Jastes be right? he wondered. She certainly is different from other\nwomen, and she did imply there were things about her I didn’t know.\nElend pushed the thought out of his mind. Valette was different, true—\nbut she was also innocent, in a way. Eager, full of wonder and spunk.\nHe worried about her; she obviously didn’t know how dangerous\nLuthadel could be. There was so much more to politics in the city than\nsimple parties and petty intrigues. What would happen if someone decided\nto send a Mistborn to deal with her and her uncle? Renoux was poorly\nconnected, and none of the court’s members would blink twice at a few\nassassinations in Fellise. Did Valette’s uncle know how to take the proper\nprecautions? Did he even worry about Allomancers?\nElend sighed. He’d just have to make certain that Valette left the area.\nThat was the only option.\nBy the time his carriage reached Keep Venture, Elend had decided that he’d\ndrunk too much. He made his way up to his rooms, looking forward to his\nbed and pillows.\nThe hallway to his bedroom, however, passed by his father’s study. The\ndoor was open, and light still spilled out despite the late hour. Elend tried to\nwalk quietly on the carpeted floor, but he’d never really been all that\nstealthy.\n“Elend?” his father’s voice called from the study. “Come in here.”\nElend sighed quietly. Lord Straff Venture didn’t miss much. He was a\nTineye—his senses were so keen that he’d probably heard Elend’s carriage\napproaching outside. If I don’t deal with him now, he’ll just send the\nservants to pester me until I come down to speak with him. . . .\nElend turned and walked into the study. His father sat in his chair,"

His father sat in his chair,\nspeaking quietly with TenSoon—the Venture Kandra. Elend still wasn’t\nused to the creature’s most recent body, which had once belonged to a\nservant in the Hasting household. Elend shivered as it noticed him. It\nbowed, then quietly retreated from the room.\nElend leaned against the doorframe. Straff’s chair sat in front of several\nshelves of books—not a single one of which, Elend was confident, his\nfather had ever read. The room was lit by two lamps, their hoods mostly\nclosed to allow out only a bit of light.\n“You attended the ball tonight,” Straff said. “What did you learn?”\nElend reached up, rubbing his forehead. “That I have a tendency to drink\nfar too much brandy.”\nStraff was not amused by the comment. He was the perfect imperial\nnobleman—tall, firm-shouldered, always dressed in a tailored vest and suit.\n“You met with that . . . woman again?” he asked.\n“Valette? Hum, yes. Not for as long as I would have liked, though.”\n“I forbade you from spending time with her.”\n“Yes,” Elend said. “I remember.”\nStraff’s expression darkened. He stood, walking over to the desk. “Oh,\nElend,” he said. “When are you going to get over this childish temperament\nyou have? Do you think I don’t realize that you act foolishly simply to spite\nme?”\n“Actually, I got over my ‘childish temperament’ some time ago, Father—\nit just seems that my natural inclinations work even better to annoy you. I\nwish I had known that earlier; I could have saved a great deal of effort in\nmy younger years.”\nHis father snorted, then held up a letter. “I dictated this to Staxles a short\ntime ago. It is an acceptance of a lunch appointment with Lord Tegas\ntomorrow afternoon. If a house war does come, I want to make certain we\nare in a position to destroy the Hastings as quickly as possible, and Tegas\ncould be a strong ally. He has a daughter. I’d like you to dine with her at the\nluncheon.”\n“I’ll consider it,” Elend said, tapping his head. “I’m not sure what kind of\nstate I’ll be in tomorrow morning. Too much brandy, remember?”\n“You’ll be there, Elend. This is not a request.”\nElend paused. A part of him wanted to snap back at his father, to make a\nstand—not because he cared about where he dined, but because of\nsomething far more important.\nHasting is the second-most-powerful house in the city. If we made an\nallegiance with them, together we could keep Luthadel from chaos. We\ncould stop the house war, not enflame it.\nThat’s what his books had done to him—they had changed him from\nrebellious fop into would-be philosopher. Unfortunately, he’d been a fool\nfor so long. Was it any wonder that Straff hadn’t noticed the change in his\nson? Elend himself was only starting to realize it.\nStraff continued to glare at him, and Elend looked away. “I’ll think about"

Elend himself was only starting to realize it.\nStraff continued to glare at him, and Elend looked away. “I’ll think about\nit,” he said.\nStraff waved his hand dismissively, turning.\nTrying to salvage something of his pride, Elend continued. “You\nprobably don’t even have to worry about the Hastings—it seems that\nthey’re making preparations to bolt the city.”\n“What?” Straff asked. “Where did you hear that?”\n“At the ball,” Elend said lightly.\n“I thought you said you didn’t learn anything important.”\n“Now, see, I never said anything of the sort. I just didn’t feel like sharing\nwith you.”\nLord Venture frowned. “I don’t know why I even care—anything you\nlearn is bound to be worthless. I tried to train you in politics, boy. I really\ndid. But now . . . well, I hope I live to see you dead, because this house is in\nfor dire times if you ever take control.”\n“I know more than you think, Father.”\nStraff laughed, walking back to sit in his chair. “I doubt that, boy. Why,\nyou can’t even bed a woman properly—the last, and only, time I know\nabout you trying it, I had to take you to the brothel myself.”\nElend flushed. Careful, he told himself. He’s bringing that up on purpose.\nHe knows how much it bothers you.\n“Get to bed, boy,” Straff said with a wave of his hand. “You look\nterrible.”\nElend stood for a moment, then finally ducked out into the hallway,\nsighing quietly to himself.\nThat’s the difference between you and them, Elend, he thought. Those\nphilosophers you read—they were revolutionaries. They were willing to risk\nexecution. You can’t even stand up to your father.\nHe walked tiredly up to his rooms—where, oddly, he found a servant\nwaiting for him.\nElend frowned. “Yes?”\n“Lord Elend, you have a guest,” the man said.\n“At this hour?”\n“It’s Lord Jastes Lekal, my lord.”\nElend cocked his head slightly. What in the Lord Ruler’s name . . .? “He’s\nwaiting in the sitting room, I assume?”\n“Yes, my lord,” the servant said.\nElend turned regretfully away from his chambers, walking back down the\nhallway. He found Jastes waiting impatiently.\n“Jastes?” Elend said tiredly, walking into the sitting room. “I hope you\nhave something very important to tell me.”\nJastes shuffled uncomfortably for a moment, looking even more nervous\nthan normal.\n“What?” Elend demanded, his patience waning.\n“It’s about the girl.”\n“Valette?” Elend asked. “You came here to discuss Valette? Now?”\n“You should trust your friends more,” Jastes said.\nElend snorted. “Trust your knowledge of women? No offense, Jastes, but\nI think not.”\n“I had her followed, Elend,” Jastes blurted out.\nElend paused. “What?”\n“I had her carriage followed. Or, at least, I had someone watch for it at\nthe city gates. She wasn’t in it when it left the city.”\n“What do you mean?” Elend asked, his frown deepening."

She wasn’t in it when it left the city.”\n“What do you mean?” Elend asked, his frown deepening.\n“She wasn’t in the carriage, Elend,” Jastes repeated. “While her\nTerrisman was producing papers for the guards, my man snuck up and\npeeked through the carriage window, and there was nobody inside.\n“The carriage must have dropped her off somewhere in town. She’s a spy\nfrom one of the other houses—they’re trying to get at your father through\nyou. They created the perfect woman to attract you—dark-haired, a bit\nmysterious, and outside of the regular political structure. They made her\nlowborn enough that it would be a scandal for you to be interested in her,\nthen set her on you.”\n“Jastes, this is ridicu—”\n“Elend,” Jastes interrupted. “Tell me one more time: How did you meet\nher the first time?”\nElend paused. “She was standing on the balcony.”\n“In your reading spot,” Jastes said. “Everyone knows that’s where you\nusually go. Coincidence?”\nElend closed his eyes. Not Valette. She can’t be part of all this. But,\nimmediately, another thought occurred to him. I told her about the atium!\nHow could I be so stupid?\nIt couldn’t be true. He wouldn’t believe that he had been duped so easily.\nBut . . . could he risk it? He was a bad son, true, but he was no traitor to the\nhouse. He didn’t want to see Venture fall; he wanted to lead it someday, so\nthat perhaps he’d be able to change things.\nHe bid Jastes farewell, then walked back to his rooms with a distracted step.\nHe felt too tired to think about house politics. However, when he finally got\ninto bed, he found that he couldn’t sleep.\nEventually, he rose, sending for a servant.\n“Tell my father I want to make a trade,” Elend explained to the man. “I’ll\ngo to his luncheon tomorrow, just as he wants.” Elend paused, standing in\nhis evening robe by his bedroom door.\n“In exchange,” he finally said, “tell him I want to borrow a couple of\nspies so that they can follow someone for me.”\nThe others all think I should have had Kwaan executed for betraying me. To tell the truth, I’d probably kill him this moment if I knew where he’d gone. At the time,\nhowever, I just couldn’t do it.\nThe man had become like a father to me. To this day, I don’t know why he suddenly decided that I wasn’t the Hero. Why did he turn against me, denouncing me to the\nentire Conclave of Worldbringers?\nWould he rather that the Deepness win? Surely, even if I’m not the right one—as Kwaan now claims—my presence at the Well of Ascension couldn’t possibly be\nworse than what will happen if the Deepness continues to destroy the land.\n29\nI V\nT’S ALMOST OVER, IN READ.\nWe can see the cavern from our camp. It will take a few more hours of hiking to reach it, but I know that it is the right place. I can feel it somehow, feel it up there . . .\npulsing, in my mind."

The wind blows all the\ntime. I fear for Fedik—he hasn’t been quite the same since the creature made of mist attacked him, and I worry that he will wander off a cliffside or slip through one of the\nmany icy rifts in the ground.\nThe Terrismen, however, are a wonder. It is fortunate that we brought them, for no regular packmen would have survived the trip. The Terrismen don’t seem to mind\nthe cold—something about their strange metabolisms gives them a supernatural ability to resist the elements. Perhaps they have “saved up” heat from their bodies for later\nuse?\nThey won’t talk about their powers, however—and I am sure that Rashek is to blame. The other packmen look to him for leadership, though I don’t think he has\ncomplete control over them. Before he was stabbed, Fedik feared that the Terrismen would abandon us up here in the ice. I don’t think that will happen, however. I am\nhere by providence of Terris prophecies—these men will not disobey their own religion simply because one of their number has taken a dislike to me.\nI did finally confront Rashek. He did not want to speak to me, of course, but I forced him. Unleashed, he spoke at great length regarding his hatred of Khlennium\nand my people. He thinks that we have turned his people into little more than slaves. He thinks that Terrismen deserve far more—he keeps saying that his people should be\n“dominant” because of their supernatural powers.\nI fear his words, for I see some truth in them. Yesterday, one of the packmen lifted a boulder of enormous size, then tossed it out of our way with an almost casual\nthrow. I have not seen such a feat of strength in all my days.\nThese Terrismen could be very dangerous, I think. Perhaps we have treated them unfairly. However, men like Rashek must be contained—he irrationally believes\nthat all people outside of Terris have oppressed him. He is such a young man to be so angry.\nIt is so cold. When this is finished, I think I should like to live where it is warm all year. Braches has told of such places, islands to the south where great mountains\ncreate fire.\nWhat will it be like, when this is all over? I will be just a regular man again. An unimportant man. It sounds nice—more desirable, even, than a warm sun and a\nwindless sky. I am so tired of being the Hero of Ages, tired of entering cities to find either armed hostility or fanatic adoration. I am tired of being loved and hated for what\na bunch of old men say I will eventually do.\nI want to be forgotten. Obscurity. Yes, that would be nice.\nIf men read these words, let them know that power is a heavy burden. Seek not to be bound by its chains. The Terris prophecies say that I will have the power to save\nthe world.

She’d finished the entire newest portion of the logbook in one\nsitting, a feat that surprised even her. The gardens of Mansion Renoux\nextended before her, the cultured pathways, broad-limbed trees, and quiet\nstream creating her favorite reading spot. The sun was low in the sky, and it\nwas beginning to get chilly.\nShe wound her way up the path toward the mansion. Despite the chill\nevening, she could barely imagine a place like the one the Lord Ruler\ndescribed. She had seen snow on some distant peaks, but she had rarely\nseen it fall—and even then it was usually just an icy slush. To experience\nthat much snow day after day, to be in danger of having it fall upon you in\ngreat crushing avalanches . . .\nA part of her wished that she could visit such places, no matter how\ndangerous. Though the logbook didn’t describe the Lord Ruler’s entire\njourney, some of the marvels it did include—the ice fields to the north, the\ngreat black lake, and the Terris waterfalls—sounded amazing.\nIf only he’d put in more detail about what things look like! she thought\nwith annoyance. The Lord Ruler spent far too much time worrying. Though,\nadmittedly, she was beginning to feel an odd sort of . . . familiarity with him\nthrough his words. She found it hard to associate the person in her mind\nwith the dark creature that had caused so much death. What had occurred at\nthe Well of Ascension? What could have changed him so drastically? She\nhad to know.\nShe reached the mansion and went searching for Sazed. She was back to\nwearing dresses—it felt odd to be seen in trousers by anyone but the\ncrewmembers. She smiled at Lord Renoux’s interior steward as she passed,\neagerly climbing the main entryway stairs and seeking out the library.\nSazed wasn’t inside.

That must\nhave been what happened—he couldn’t resist the temptation to use the\npower selfishly. But, why isn’t there another entry? Why wouldn’t he speak\nfurther of his accomplishments?”\n“Perhaps the power changed him too much,” Sazed said. “Or, maybe he\nsimply didn’t feel a need to record any more. He had accomplished his goal,\nand had become immortal as a side benefit. Keeping a journal for one’s\nposterity becomes somewhat redundant when one is going to live forever, I\nthink.”\n“That’s just . . .” Vin ground her teeth in frustration. “It’s a very\nunsatisfying end to a story, Sazed.”\nHe smiled in amusement. “Be careful, Mistress—become too fond of\nreading, and you may just turn into a scholar.”\nVin shook her head. “Not if all the books I read are going to end like this\none!”\n“If it is of any comfort,” Sazed said, “you are not the only one who is\ndisappointed by the logbook’s contents.

Has my lady suddenly become an optimist?”\n“Has my Terrisman suddenly become a smart-mouth?” Vin retorted.\n“He always has been, I think,” Sazed said with a slight smile. “It is one\nof the things that made him a poor steward—at least, in the eyes of most of\nhis masters.”\n“Then they must have been fools,” Vin said honestly.\n“So I was inclined to think, Mistress,” Sazed replied. “We should return\nto the mansion—we should not be seen out in the gardens when the mists\narrive, I think.”\n“I’m just going to go back out into them.”\n“There are many of the grounds staff that do not know you are Mistborn,\nMistress,” Sazed said. “It would be a good secret to keep, I think.”\n“I know,” Vin said, turning. “Let’s go back then.”\n“A wise plan.”\nThey walked for a few moments, enjoying the eastern garden’s subtle\nbeauty. The grasses were kept carefully trimmed, and they had been\narranged in pleasant tiers, the occasional shrubbery giving accent. The\nsouthern garden was far more spectacular, with its brook, trees, and exotic\nplants. But the eastern garden had its own peace—the serenity of simplicity.\n“Sazed?” Vin said in a quiet voice.\n“Yes, Mistress?”\n“It’s all going to change, isn’t it?”\n“What specifically do you mean?”\n“Everything,” Vin said. “Even if we aren’t all dead in a year, the\ncrewmembers will be off working on other projects. Ham will probably be\nback with his family, Dox and Kelsier will be planning some new escapade,\nClubs will be renting his shop to another crew. . . . Even these gardens that\nwe’ve spent so much money on—they’ll belong to someone else.”\nSazed nodded. “What you say is likely. Though, if things go well,\nperhaps the skaa rebellion will be ruling Luthadel by this time next year.”\n“Maybe,” Vin said. “But even still . . . things will change.”\n“That is the nature of all life, Mistress,” Sazed said. “The world must\nchange.”\n“I know,” Vin said with a sigh. “I just wish . . . Well, I actually like my\nlife now, Sazed. I like spending time with the crew, and I like training with\nKelsier. I love going to balls with Elend on the weekends, love walking in\nthese gardens with you. I don’t want these things to change. I don’t want\nmy life to go back to the way it was a year ago.”\n“It doesn’t have to, Mistress,” Sazed said. “It could change for the\nbetter.”"

When I practice in the future, I’ll have to do\nit alone.\n“As for Elend, he doesn’t even know that I’m skaa—and it’s my job to\ntry and destroy his family. Even if House Venture doesn’t fall by my hand,\nothers will bring it down—I know Shan Elariel is planning something, and I\nhaven’t been able to discover anything about her schemes.\n“That’s only the beginning, though. We face the Final Empire. We’ll\nprobably fail—to be honest, I don’t see how things could possibly turn out\notherwise. We’ll fight, we’ll do some good, but we won’t change much—\nand those of us who survive will spend the rest of our lives running from\nthe Inquisitors. Everything’s going to change, Sazed, and I can’t stop it.”\nSazed smiled fondly. “Then, Mistress,” he said quietly, “simply enjoy\nwhat you have. The future will surprise you, I think.”\n“Maybe,” Vin said, unconvinced.\n“Ah, you just need to have hope, Mistress. Perhaps you’ve earned a little\nbit of good fortune. There were a group of people before the Ascension\nknown as the Astalsi. They claimed that each person was born with a certain\nfinite amount of ill luck. And so, when an unfortunate event happened, they\nthought themselves blessed—thereafter, their lives could only get better.”\nVin raised an eyebrow. “Sounds a bit simpleminded to me.”\n“I do not believe so,” Sazed said. “Why, the Astalsi were rather advanced\n—they mixed religion with science quite profoundly. They thought that\ndifferent colors were indications of different kinds of fortune, and were\nquite detailed in their descriptions of light and color. Why, it’s from them\nthat we get some of our best ideas as to what things might have looked like\nbefore the Ascension. They had a scale of colors, and used it to describe the\nsky of the deepest blue and various plants in their shades of green.\n“Regardless, I find their philosophies regarding luck and fortune\nenlightened. To them, a poor life was only a sign of fortune to come. It\nmight be a good fit for you, Mistress; you could benefit from the knowledge\nthat your luck cannot always be bad.”\n“I don’t know,” Vin said skeptically. “I mean, if your bad luck were\nlimited, wouldn’t your good luck be limited too? Every time something\ngood happened, I’d be worried about using it all up.”\n“Hum,” Sazed said. “I suppose that depends on your viewpoint,\nMistress.”\n“How can you be so optimistic?” Vin asked. “You and Kelsier both.”\n“I don’t know, Mistress,” Sazed said. “Perhaps our lives have been easier\nthan yours. Or, perhaps we are simply more foolish.”\nVin fell silent. They walked for a short time longer, weaving their way\nback toward the building, but not rushing the walk. “Sazed,” she finally\nsaid. “When you saved me, that night in the rain, you used Feruchemy,\ndidn’t you?”"

The Inquisitor was very focused on you, and I\nwas able to sneak up behind him, then hit him with a stone. I had grown\nmany times stronger than a regular man, and my blow threw him into the\nwall, breaking several of his bones, I suspect.”\n“Is that it?” Vin asked.\n“You sound disappointed, Mistress,” Sazed noted, smiling. “You\nexpected something more spectacular, I suppose?”\nVin nodded. “It’s just . . . you’ve been so quiet about Feruchemy. That\nmakes it seem more mystical, I guess.”\nSazed sighed. “There is really little to hide from you, Mistress. The truly\nunique power of Feruchemy—the ability to store and recover memories—\nyou must surely have already guessed. The rest of the powers are not\ndifferent, really, from the powers granted to you by pewter and tin. A few of\nthem are a little more odd—making a Feruchemist heavier, or changing his\nage—but they offer little martial application.”\n“Age?” Vin said, perking up. “You could make yourself younger?”\n“Not really, Mistress,” Sazed said. “Remember, a Feruchemist must draw\nhis powers from his own body. He could, for instance, spend a few weeks\nwith his body aged to the point that it felt and looked ten years older than he\nreally was. Then, he could withdraw that age to make himself seem ten\nyears younger for an equal amount of time. However, in Feruchemy, there\nmust be a balance.”\nVin thought about that for a moment. “Does the metal you use matter?”\nshe asked. “Like in Allomancy?”\n“Most certainly,” Sazed said. “The metal determines what can be stored.”\nVin nodded and continued to walk, thinking over what he’d said. “Sazed,\ncan I have a bit of your metal?” she finally asked.\n“My metal, Mistress?”\n“Something you’ve used as a Feruchemical store,” Vin said. “I want to\ntry burning it—maybe that will let me use some of its power.”\nSazed frowned curiously.\n“Has anyone ever tried it before?”\n“I’m sure someone must have,” Sazed said. “But, I honestly can’t think\nof a specific example. Perhaps if I were to go search my memory\ncopperminds . . .”\n“Why not just let me try it now?” Vin asked. “Do you have something\nmade from one of the basic metals? Something you haven’t stored anything\ntoo valuable in?”\nSazed paused, then reached up to one of his oversized earlobes and undid\nan earring much like the one Vin wore. He handed the earring’s tiny\nbacking, used to hold the earring in place, to Vin. “It is pure pewter,\nMistress. I have stored a moderate amount of strength in it.”\nVin nodded, swallowing the tiny stud. She felt at her Allomantic reserve,\nbut the stud’s metal didn’t seem to do anything different. She tentatively\nburned pewter.\n“Anything?” Sazed asked."

There was\nsomething there, something different.\n“What is it, Mistress?” Sazed asked, uncharacteristic eagerness sounding\nin his voice.\n“I . . . can feel the power, Saze. It’s faint—far beyond my grasp—but I\nswear that there’s another reserve within me, one that only appears when\nI’m burning your metal.”\nSazed frowned. “It’s faint, you say? Like . . . you can see a shadow of the\nreserve, but can’t access the power itself?”\nVin nodded. “How do you know?”\n“That’s what it feels like when you try to use another Feruchemist’s\nmetals, Mistress,” Sazed said, sighing. “I should have suspected this would\nbe the result. You cannot access the power because it does not belong to\nyou.”\n“Oh,” Vin said.\n“Do not be too disappointed, Mistress. If Allomancers could steal\nstrength from my people, it would already be known. It was a clever\nthought, however.” He turned, pointing toward the mansion. “The carriage\nhas already arrived. We are late for the meeting, I think.”\nVin nodded, and they hurried their pace toward the mansion.\nFunny, Kelsier thought to himself as he slipped across the darkened\ncourtyard before Mansion Renoux. I have to sneak into my own house, as if\nI were attacking some nobleman’s keep.\nThere was no avoiding it, however—not with his reputation. Kelsier the\nthief had been distinctive enough; Kelsier the rebellion instigator and skaa\nspiritual leader was even more infamous. That didn’t, of course, keep him\nfrom spreading his nightly chaos—he just had to be more careful. More and\nmore families were pulling out of the city, and the powerful houses were\ngrowing increasingly paranoid. In a way, that made manipulating them\neasier—but sneaking around their keeps was getting very dangerous.\nIn comparison, Mansion Renoux was virtually unprotected. There were\nguards, of course, but no Mistings. Renoux had to keep a low profile; too\nmany Allomancers would make him stand out. Kelsier kept to the shadows,\ncarefully making his way around to the east side of the building. Then he\nPushed off a coin and guided himself up onto Renoux’s own balcony.\nKelsier landed lightly, then peeked through the glass balcony doors. The\ndrapes were shut, but he could pick out Dockson, Vin, Sazed, Ham, and\nBreeze standing around Renoux’s desk. Renoux himself sat in the far corner\nof the room, staying out of the proceedings. His contract included playing\nthe part of Lord Renoux, but he didn’t wish to be involved in the plan\nanymore than he had to.\nKelsier shook his head. It would be far too easy for an assassin to get in\nhere. I’ll have to make sure that Vin continues to sleep at Clubs’ shop. He\nwasn’t worried about Renoux; the kandra’s nature was such that he didn’t\nneed to fear an assassin’s blade."

He\nwasn’t worried about Renoux; the kandra’s nature was such that he didn’t\nneed to fear an assassin’s blade.\nKelsier tapped lightly on the door, and Dockson strolled over, pulling it\nopen.\n“And he makes his stunning entry!” Kelsier announced, sweeping into\nthe room, throwing back his mistcloak.\nDockson snorted, shutting the doors. “You’re truly a wonder to behold,\nKell. Particularly the soot stains on your knees.”\n“I had to do some crawling tonight,” Kelsier said, waving an indifferent\nhand. “There’s an unused drainage ditch that passes right under Keep\nLekal’s defensive wall. You’d think they’d get that patched up.”\n“I doubt they need worry,” Breeze said from beside the desk. “Most of\nyou Mistborn are probably too proud to crawl. I’m surprised you were\nwilling to do so yourself.”\n“Too proud to crawl?” Kelsier said. “Nonsense! Why, I’d say that we\nMistborn are too proud not to be humble enough to go crawling about—in a\ndignified manner, of course.”\nDockson frowned, approaching the desk. “Kell, that didn’t make any\nsense.”\n“We Mistborn need not make sense,” Kelsier said haughtily. “What’s\nthis?”\n“From your brother,” Dockson said, pointing at a large map laid across\nthe desk. “It arrived this afternoon in the hollow of a broken table leg that\nthe Canton of Orthodoxy hired Clubs to repair.”\n“Interesting,” Kelsier said, scanning the map. “It’s a list of the Soothing\nstations, I assume?”\n“Indeed,” Breeze said. “It’s quite the discovery—I’ve never seen such a\ndetailed, carefully drawn map of the city. Why, it not only shows every one\nof the thirty-four Soothing stations, but also locations of Inquisitor activity,\nas well as places that the different Cantons are concerned about. I haven’t\nhad the opportunity to associate much with your brother, but I must say that\nthe man is obviously a genius!”\n“It’s almost hard to believe he’s related to Kell, eh?” Dockson said with a\nsmile. He had a notepad before him, and was in the process of making a list\nof all the Soothing stations.\nKelsier snorted. “Marsh might be the genius, but I’m the handsome one.\nWhat are these numbers?”\n“Inquisitor raids and dates,” Ham said. “You’ll notice that Vin’s\ncrewhouse is listed.”\nKelsier nodded. “How in the world did Marsh manage to steal a map like\nthis?”\n“He didn’t,” Dockson said as he wrote. “There was a note with the map.\nApparently, high prelans gave it to him—they’ve been very impressed with\nMarsh, and wanted him to look over the city and recommend locations for\nnew Soothing stations. It seems that the Ministry is a bit worried about the\nhouse war, and they want to send out some extra Soothers to try and keep\nthings under control.”\n“We’re supposed to send the map back inside the repaired table leg,”\nSazed said. “Once we are done this evening, I shall endeavor to copy it in as\nshort a time as possible.”"

The day when you’ll stop memorizing and start teaching is\ncoming soon, Saze. I hope your people are ready.\nKelsier turned, studying the map. It was as impressive as Breeze had\nsaid. Indeed, Marsh must have taken an extremely great risk in sending it\naway. Perhaps a foolhardy risk, even—but the information it contained . . .\nWe’ll have to get this back quickly, Kelsier thought. Tomorrow morning,\nif possible.\n“What is this?” Vin asked quietly, leaning across the large map and\npointing. She wore a noblewoman’s dress—a pretty one-piece garment that\nwas only slightly less ornate than a ball gown.\nKelsier smiled. He could remember a time when Vin had looked\nfrighteningly awkward in a dress, but she seemed to have taken an\nincreasing liking to them. She still didn’t move quite like a noble-born lady.\nShe was graceful—but it was the dexterous grace of a predator, not the\ndeliberate grace of a courtly lady. Still, the gowns seemed to fit Vin now—\nin a way that had nothing at all to do with tailoring.\nAh, Mare, Kelsier thought. You always wanted a daughter you could\nteach to walk the line between noblewoman and thief. They would have\nliked each other; they both had a hidden streak of unconventionality.\nPerhaps if his wife were still alive, she could have taught Vin things about\npretending to be a noblewoman that even Sazed didn’t know.\nOf course, if Mare were still alive, I wouldn’t be doing any of this. I\nwouldn’t dare.\n“Look!” Vin said. “One of these Inquisitor dates is new—it’s marked as\nyesterday!”\nDockson shot a glance at Kelsier.\nWe would have had to tell her eventually anyway. . . . “That was Theron’s\ncrew,” Kelsier said. “An Inquisitor hit them yesterday evening.”\nVin paled.\n“Should I recognize that name?” Ham asked.\n“Theron’s crew was part of the team that was trying to dupe the Ministry\nwith Camon,” Vin said. “This means . . . they probably still have my trail.”\nThe Inquisitor recognized her that night when we infiltrated the palace.\nHe wanted to know who her father was. It’s fortunate that those inhuman\nthings make the nobility uncomfortable—otherwise, we’d have to worry\nabout sending her to balls.\n“Theron’s crew,” Vin said. “Was . . . it like last time?”\nDockson nodded. “No survivors.”\nThere was an uncomfortable silence, and Vin looked visibly sick.\nPoor kid, Kelsier thought. There was little they could do but move on,\nthough. “All right. How are we going to use this map?”\n“It has some Ministry notes on house defenses,” Ham said. “Those will\nbe useful.”\n“There doesn’t appear to be any pattern in the Inquisitor hits, however,”\nBreeze said. “They probably just go where the information leads them.”"

If we\nwere to take them all out at once . . .”\n“We’d never be able to kill that many ourselves,” Dockson said.\n“We could if we used the rest of our army,” Ham said. “We’ve got them\nstashed throughout the slums.”\n“I have a better idea,” Kelsier said. “We can hire other thieving crews. If\nwe had ten crews, each assigned to take out three stations, we could clear\nthe city of Ministry Soothers and Seekers in barely a few hours.”\n“We’d have to discuss timing, though,” Dockson said. “Breeze is right—\nkilling that many obligators in one evening means making a major\ncommitment. It won’t take the Inquisitors long to retaliate.”\nKelsier nodded. You’re right, Dox. Timing will be vital. “Would you look\ninto it? Find some appropriate crews, but wait until we decide on a time\nbefore giving them the locations of the Soothing stations.”\nDockson nodded.\n“Good,” Kelsier said. “Speaking of our soldiers, Ham, how are things\ngoing with them?”\n“Better than I expected, actually,” Ham said. “They went through training\nin the caves, and so they’re fairly competent. And, they consider themselves\nthe more ‘faithful’ segment of the army, since they didn’t follow Yeden to\nbattle against your will.”\nBreeze snorted. “That’s a convenient way of looking past the fact that\nthey lost three-fourths of their army in a tactical blunder.”\n“They’re good men, Breeze,” Ham said firmly. “And so were those who\ndied. Don’t speak ill of them. Regardless, I worry about hiding the army as\nwe are—it won’t be too long before one of the teams gets discovered.”\n“That’s why none of them know where to find the others,” Kelsier said.\n“I do want to mention something about the men,” Breeze said, seating\nhimself in one of Renoux’s desk chairs. “I see the importance of sending\nHammond to train the soldiers—but honestly, what is the reason for forcing\nDockson and myself to go and visit them?”\n“The men need to know who their leaders are,” Kelsier said. “If Ham\nwere to become indisposed, someone else will need to take command.”\n“Why not you?” Breeze asked.\n“Just bear with me,” Kelsier said, smiling. “It’s for the best.”"

Unfortunately, he\ncouldn’t go out and roam the hallways—only certain servants knew he was\nat the mansion, and he needed to keep a low profile, now that his reputation\nwas building.\nHis reputation. He sighed as he leaned against the balcony railing,\nwatching the mists. In a way, the things he did worried even him. The\nothers didn’t question him out loud, as per his request, but he could tell that\nthey were still bothered by his growing fame.\nIt’s the best way. I may not need all of this . . . but, if I do, I’m going to be\nglad I went to the trouble.\nA soft knock came at his door. He turned, curious, as Sazed peeked his\nhead into the room.\n“I apologize, Master Kelsier,” Sazed said. “But a guard came to me and\nsaid he could see you up on your balcony. He was worried that you’d give\nyourself away.”\nKelsier sighed, but backed away from the balcony, pulling the doors\nclosed and shutting the drapes. “I’m not meant for anonymity, Saze. For a\nthief, I’m really not all that good at hiding.”\nSazed smiled and began to withdraw.\n“Sazed?” Kelsier asked, causing the Terrisman to pause. “I can’t sleep—\ndo you have a new proposal for me?”\nSazed smiled deeply, walking into the room. “Of course, Master Kelsier.\nLately, I’ve been thinking that you should hear about the Truths of the\nBennet. They fit you quite well, I think. The Bennet were a highly\ndeveloped people who lived on the southern islands. They were brave\nseafarers and brilliant cartographers; some of the maps the Final Empire\nstill uses were developed by Bennet explorers.\n“Their religion was designed to be practiced aboard ships that were away\nat sea for months at a time. The captain was also their minister, and no man\nwas allowed to command unless he had received theological training.”\n“Probably weren’t very many mutinies.”\nSazed smiled. “It was a good religion, Master Kelsier. It focused on\ndiscovery and knowledge—to these people, the making of maps was a\nreverent duty. They believed that once all of the world was known,\nunderstood, and catalogued, men would finally find peace and harmony."

What made them keep fighting?”\n“They were the most determined, I think.”\n“But they didn’t have any leaders,” Kelsier said. “The Lord Ruler had\nslaughtered the entire Vallan religious council as part of his first conquest.”\n“Oh, they had leaders, Master Kelsier,” Sazed said. “Dead ones, true, but\nleaders nonetheless.”\n“Some men would say that their devotion didn’t make sense,” Kelsier\nsaid. “The loss of the Vallan leaders should have broken the people, not\nmade them more determined to keep going.”\nSazed shook his head. “Men are more resilient than that, I think. Our\nbelief is often strongest when it should be weakest. That is the nature of\nhope.”\nKelsier nodded.\n“Did you want further instruction on the Valla?”\n“No. Thanks, Saze. I just needed to be reminded that there were people\nwho fought even when things looked hopeless.”\nSazed nodded, rising. “I think I understand, Master Kelsier.

Vin couldn’t quite decide why.\nShe thought about it as she waited for a servant to take her shawl. The\nnormal limelights shone outside the stained-glass windows, spraying the\nroom with shards of light. The tables were immaculate beneath their\npillared overhang. The lord’s table, set on the small balcony at the very end\nof the hallway, looked as regal as ever.\nIt’s almost . . . too perfect, Vin thought, frowning to herself. Everything\nseemed slightly exaggerated. The tablecloths were even whiter, and pressed\neven flatter, than usual. The servants’ uniforms seemed particularly sharp.\nInstead of regular soldiers at the doors, hazekillers stood looking\nintentionally impressive, distinguished by their wooden shields and lack of\narmor. All together, the room made it seem as if even the regular Venture\nperfection had been heightened.\n“Something’s wrong, Sazed,” she whispered as a servant moved off to\nprepare her table.\n“What do you mean, Mistress?” the tall steward asked, standing behind\nher and to the side.\n“There are too many people here,” Vin said, realizing one of the things\nthat was bothering her. Ball attendance had been tapering off during the last\nfew months. Yet, it seemed like everyone had returned for the Venture\nevent. And they all wore their finest.\n“Something’s going on,” Vin said quietly. “Something we don’t know\nabout.”\n“Yes . . .” Sazed said quietly. “I sense it too. Perhaps I should go to the\nstewards’ dinner early.”\n“Good idea,” Vin said. “I think I might just skip the meal this evening.\nWe’re a bit late, and it looks like people have already started chatting.”\nSazed smiled.\n“What?”\n“I remember a time when you would never skip a meal, Mistress.”\nVin snorted. “Just be glad I never tried to stuff my pockets with food\nfrom one of these balls—trust me, I was tempted. Now, get going.”\nSazed nodded and moved off toward the stewards’ dinner. Vin scanned\nthe chatting groups. No sign of Shan, thankfully, she thought. Unfortunately,\nKliss was nowhere to be seen either, so Vin had to choose someone else to\ngo to for gossip. She strolled forward, smiling at Lord Idren Seeris, a cousin\nto House Elariel and a man she had danced with on several occasions. He\nacknowledged her with a stiff nod, and she joined his group.\nVin smiled at the other members of the group—three women and one\nother lord. She knew them all at least passingly, and had danced with Lord\nYestal. However, this evening all four of them gave her cold looks.\n“I haven’t been to Keep Venture in a while,” Vin said, falling into her\npersona as a country girl. “I’d forgotten how majestic it is!”\n“Indeed,” said one of the ladies. “Excuse me—I’m going to go get\nsomething to drink.”"

Coming, Triss?”\n“Of course,” the final lady said, joining Yestal as they walked away.\nIdren adjusted his spectacles, shooting Vin a halfhearted look of apology,\nthen withdrew. Vin stood, dumbfounded. She hadn’t received such an\nobviously cold reception since her first few balls.\nWhat’s going on? she thought with increasing trepidation. Is this Shan’s\nwork? Could she turn an entire room full of people against me?\nNo, that didn’t feel right. It would have required too much effort. In\naddition, the oddity wasn’t just around her. All of the groups of noblemen\nwere . . . different this evening.\nVin tried a second group, with an even worse result. As soon as she\njoined, the members pointedly ignored her. Vin felt so out of place that she\nwithdrew, fleeing to get herself a cup of wine. As she walked, she noticed\nthat the first group—the one with Yestal and Idren—had re-formed with\nexactly the same members.\nVin paused, standing just inside the shade of the eastern overhang and\nscanning the crowd. There were very few people dancing, and she\nrecognized them all as established couples. There also seemed to be very\nlittle mingling between groups or tables. While the ballroom was filled, it\nseemed most of the attendees were distinctly trying to ignore everyone else.\nI need to get a better view of this, she thought, walking to the stairwell. A\nshort climb later, she came out on the long, corridorlike balcony set into the\nwall above the dance floor, its familiar blue lanterns giving the stonework a\nsoft, melancholy hue.\nVin paused. Elend’s cubbyhole sat between the rightmost column and the\nwall, well lit by a single lantern. He almost always spent Venture balls\nreading there; he didn’t like the pomp and ceremony that came from hosting\na party.\nThe cubbyhole was empty. She approached the railing, then craned out to\nlook toward the far end of the grand hallway. The host’s table sat on an\noverhang at the same level as the balconies, and she was shocked to see\nElend sitting there dining with his father.\nWhat? she thought incredulously. Never once, during the half-dozen balls\nshe’d attended at Keep Venture, had she seen Elend sit with his family.\nDown below, she caught sight of a familiar, colorful-robed figure moving\nthrough the crowd. She waved toward Sazed, but he had obviously already\nseen her. As she waited for him, Vin thought she faintly heard a familiar\nvoice coming from the other end of the balcony. She turned and checked,\nnoticing a short figure she’d missed before. Kliss was speaking with a small\ngroup of minor lords.\nSo that’s where Kliss went, Vin thought. Maybe she’ll talk to me. Vin\nstood, waiting for either Kliss to finish her conversation or Sazed to arrive."

Vin\nstood, waiting for either Kliss to finish her conversation or Sazed to arrive.\nSazed came first, leaving the stairwell, breathing heavily. “Mistress,” he\nsaid in a low voice, joining her by the railing.\n“Tell me you discovered something, Sazed. This ball feels . . . creepy.\nEveryone’s so solemn and cold. It’s almost like we’re at a funeral, not a\nparty.”\n“It is an apt metaphor, my lady,” Sazed said quietly. “We have missed an\nimportant announcement. House Hasting said it is not going to hold its\nregular ball this week.”\nVin frowned. “So? Houses have canceled balls before.”\n“House Elariel canceled as well. Normally, Tekiel would come next—but\nthat house is defunct. House Shunah has already announced that it won’t be\nholding any more balls.”\n“What are you saying?”\n“It appears, Mistress, that this will be the last ball for a time . . . perhaps a\nvery long time.”\nVin glanced down at the hall’s magnificent windows, which stood above\nthe independent—almost hostile—groups of people.\n“That’s what’s going on,” she said. “They’re finalizing alliances.\nEveryone is standing with their strongest friends and supporters. They know\nthis is the last ball, and so they all came to put in an appearance, but they\nknow they’ve no time left for politicking.”\n“It seems that way, Mistress.”\n“They’re all going on the defensive,” Vin said. “Retreating behind their\nwalls, so to speak. That’s why no one wants to talk to me—we made\nRenoux too neutral a force. I don’t have a faction, and it’s a bad time to be\ngambling on random political elements.”\n“Master Kelsier needs to know this information, Mistress,” Sazed said.\n“He planned on pretending to be an informant again tonight. If he’s ignorant\nof this situation, it could seriously damage his credibility. We should leave.”\n“No,” Vin said, turning toward Sazed. “I can’t go—not when everyone\nelse is staying. They all thought it was important to come and be seen at this\nlast ball, and so I shouldn’t leave until they start to.”\nSazed nodded. “Very well.”\n“You go, Sazed. Hire a carriage and go tell Kell what we’ve learned. I’ll\nstay for a little longer, then leave when it won’t make House Renoux look\nweak.”\nSazed paused. “I . . . don’t know, Mistress.”\nVin rolled her eyes. “I appreciate the help you’ve given me, but you don’t\nneed to keep holding my hand. Plenty of people come to these balls without\ntheir stewards to watch after them.”\nSazed sighed. “Very well, Mistress. I shall return, however, after I have\nlocated Master Kelsier.”\nVin nodded, bidding him farewell, and he retreated down the stone\nstairwell. Vin leaned against the balcony in Elend’s spot, watching until\nSazed appeared below and disappeared toward the front gates.\nNow what?

Who would have thought that she would come\nto enjoy noble frivolity so much? The experience was tainted by her\nknowledge of what many noblemen were capable of, but even still, there\nhad been a . . . dreamlike joy to the entire experience.\nWould she ever attend balls like these again? What would happen to\nValette the noblewoman? Would she have to put away her dresses and\nmakeup, and return to simply being Vin the street thief? There probably\nwouldn’t be room for things like grand balls in Kelsier’s new kingdom, and\nthat might not be a bad thing—what right did she have to dance while other\nskaa starved? Yet . . . it seemed like the world would be missing something\nbeautiful without the keeps and dancers, the dresses and the festivities.\nShe sighed, leaning back from the railing, glancing down at her own\ndress. It was of a deep shimmering blue, with white circular designs sewn\naround the base of the skirt. It was sleeveless, but the blue silk gloves she\nwore ran all the way past her elbows.\nOnce she would have found the outfit frustratingly bulky. Now, however,\nshe found it beautifying. She liked how it was designed to make her look\nfull through the chest, yet accentuated her thin upper torso. She liked how it\nflared at the waist, slowly fanning out into a wide bell that rustled as she\nwalked.\nShe’d miss it—she’d miss it all. But, Sazed was right. She couldn’t stop\nthe progression of time, she could only enjoy the moment.\nI’m not going to let him sit up there at the high table all evening and\nignore me, she decided.\nVin turned and walked along the balcony, nodding to Kliss as she passed.\nThe balcony ended in a corridor that turned, and—as Vin had correctly\nguessed—led out onto the ledge that held the host’s table.\nShe stood inside the corridor for a moment, looking out. Lords and ladies\nsat in regal outfits, basking in the privilege of being invited up to sit with\nLord Straff Venture. Vin waited, trying to get Elend’s attention, and finally\none of the guests noticed her, then nudged Elend. He turned with surprise,\nsaw Vin, then flushed slightly.\nShe waved briefly, and he stood, excusing himself. Vin ducked back into\nthe stone corridor a bit so they could speak more privately.\n“Elend!” she said as he walked into the corridor. “You’re sitting with\nyour father!”\nHe nodded. “This ball has turned into something of a special event,\nValette, and my father was fairly insistent that I obey protocol.”\n“When are we going to have time to talk?”\nElend paused. “I’m not sure that we will.”\nVin frowned. He seemed . . . reserved. His usual, slightly worn and\nwrinkled suit had been replaced by a sharp, well-fitted one. His hair was\neven combed.\n“Elend?” she said, stepping forward.\nHe raised a hand, warding her back. “Things have changed, Valette.”\nNo, she thought. This can’t change, not yet! “Things? What ‘things’?"

What ‘things’?\nElend, what are you talking about?”\n“I am heir to House Venture,” he said. “And dangerous times are coming.\nHouse Hasting lost an entire convoy this afternoon, and that’s only the\nbeginning. Within the month, the keeps will openly be at war. These aren’t\nthings I can ignore, Valette. It’s time I stopped being a liability to my\nfamily.”\n“That’s fine,” Vin said. “That doesn’t mean—”\n“Valette,” Elend interrupted. “You are a liability too. A very big one. I\nwon’t lie and claim that I never cared for you—I did, and I still do.\nHowever, I knew from the start—as you did—that this could never be\nanything more than a passing dalliance. The truth is, my house needs me—\nand it’s more important than you are.”\nVin paled. “But . . .”\nHe turned to go back to dinner.\n“Elend,” she said quietly, “please don’t turn away from me.”\nHe paused, then looked back at her. “I know the truth, Valette. I know\nhow you’ve lied about who you are. I don’t care, really—I’m not angry, or\neven disappointed. The truth is, I expected it. You’re just . . . playing the\ngame. Like we all are.” He paused, then shook his head and turned away\nfrom her. “Like I am.”\n“Elend?” she said, reaching for him.\n“Don’t make me embarrass you in public, Valette.”\nVin paused, feeling numb. And then, she was too angry to be numb—too\nangry, too frustrated . . . and too terrified.\n“Don’t leave,” she whispered. “Don’t you leave me too.”\n“I’m sorry,” he said. “But I have to go meet with my friends. It was . . .\nfun.”\nAnd he left.\nVin stood in the darkened corridor. She felt herself shiver quietly, and she\nturned to stumble back out onto the main balcony. To the side, she could see\nElend bid good evening to his family, then head through a back corridor\ntoward the keep’s living section.\nHe can’t do this to me. Not Elend. Not now . . .\nHowever, a voice from within—a voice she had nearly forgotten—began\nto speak. Of course he left you, Reen whispered. Of course he abandoned\nyou. Everyone will betray you, Vin. What did I teach you?\nNo! she thought. It’s just the political tension. Once this is over, I’ll be\nable to convince him to come back. . . .\nI never came back for you, Reen whispered. He won’t either. The voice\nfelt so real—it was almost like she could hear him beside her.\nVin leaned up against the balcony railing, using the iron grating for\nstrength, holding herself up. She wouldn’t let him destroy her. A life on the\nstreets hadn’t been able to break her; she wouldn’t let a self-important\nnobleman do so. She just kept telling herself that.\nBut, why did this hurt so much more than starvation—so much more than\none of Camon’s beatings?"

Don’t worry,\nchild—he’ll get what he deserves shortly.”\nVin turned, frowning at the odd tone in Kliss’s voice. The woman didn’t\nseem like herself. She seemed too . . . controlled.\n“Deliver a message to your uncle for me, will you dear?” Kliss asked\nlightly. “Tell him that a man such as himself—without house alliances—\nmight have a difficult time gathering intelligence in the upcoming months.\nIf he needs a good source of information, tell him to send for me. I know\nlots of interesting things.”\n“You’re an informant!” Vin said, pushing aside her pain for the moment.\n“But, you’re . . .”\n“A foolish gossip?” the short woman asked. “Why, yes I am. It’s\nfascinating, the kinds of things you can learn when you’re known as the\ncourt gossip. People come to you to spread obvious lies—such as the things\nyou told me about House Hasting last week. Why would you want me to\nspread such untruths? Could House Renoux be making a bid for the\nweapons market during the house war? Indeed—could Renoux be behind\nthe recent attack on the Hasting barges?”\nKliss’s eyes twinkled. “Tell your uncle that I can be made to keep quiet\nabout what I know—for a small fee.”\n“You’ve been duping me all along. . . .” Vin said numbly.\n“Of course, dear,” Kliss said, patting Vin’s arm. “That’s what we do here\nat court. You’ll learn eventually—if you survive. Now, be a good child and\ndeliver my message, all right?”\nKliss turned, her squat, gaudy dress suddenly seeming a brilliant costume\nto Vin.\n“Wait!” Vin said. “What was that you said about Elend earlier? He’s\ngoing to get what he deserves?”\n“Hum?” Kliss said, turning. “Why . . . that’s right. You’ve been asking\nafter Shan Elariel’s plans, haven’t you?”\nShan? Vin thought with rising concern. “What is she planning?”\n“Now that, my dear, is an expensive secret indeed. I could tell you . . .\nbut then, what would I have in return? A woman of an unimportant house\nlike myself needs to find sustenance somewhere. . . .”\nVin pulled off her sapphire necklace, the only piece of jewelry she was\nwearing. “Here. Take it.”\nKliss accepted the necklace with a thoughtful expression. “Hum, yes,\nvery nice indeed.”\n“What do you know?” Vin snapped.\n“Young Elend is going to be one of the first Venture casualties in the\nhouse war, I’m afraid,” Kliss said, stuffing the necklace into a sleeve\npocket. “It’s unfortunate—he really does seem like a nice boy. Too nice,\nprobably.”\n“When?” Vin demanded. “Where? How?”"

No wonder Renoux brought such a distant cousin with him to\nLuthadel!”\n“Speak!” Vin said, taking a step forward.\n“You’re too late to help him,” Kliss said. “I’d never sell a secret like this\nif it had a chance of turning on me!”\n“Tell me!”\n“He’ll be assassinated by Elariel Allomancers this evening,” Kliss\nwhispered. “He might be dead already—it was supposed to happen as soon\nas he withdrew from the lord’s table. But if you want revenge, you’ll have\nto look toward Lord Straff Venture too.”\n“Elend’s father?” Vin asked with surprise.\n“Of course, foolish child,” Kliss said. “Lord Venture would love nothing\nmore than an excuse to give the house title to his nephew instead. All\nVenture had to do was withdraw a few of his soldiers from the rooftop\naround young Elend’s room to let in the Elariel assassins. And, since the\nassassination will occur during one of Elend’s little philosophy meetings,\nLord Venture will be able to rid himself of a Hasting and a Lekal too!”\nVin spun. I have to do something!\n“Of course,” Kliss said with a chuckle, standing up. “Lord Venture is in\nfor a surprise himself. I’ve heard that your Elend has some very . . . choice\nbooks in his possession. Young Venture should be much more careful about\nthe things he tells his women, I think.”\nVin turned back to the smiling Kliss. The woman winked at her. “I’ll\nkeep your Allomancy a secret, child.

Venture is a very\nold keep, and the back passages leading to the lords’ quarters are quite the\nmaze. If you don’t know your way, you’ll end up lost for hours.”\nVin glanced around, feeling helpless.\n“Besides, child,” Kliss added, turning to walk away. “Didn’t the boy just\nspurn you? What do you owe him?”\nVin paused.\nShe’s right. What do I owe him?\nThe answer came immediately. I love him.\nWith that thought came strength. Vin rushed forward despite Kliss’s\nlaughter. She had to try. She entered the corridor and moved into the back\npassageways. However, Kliss’s words soon proved true: The dark stone\npassageways were narrow and unadorned. She’d never find her way in time.\nThe roof, she thought. Elend’s rooms will have an outside balcony. I need\na window!\nShe dashed down a passage, kicking off her shoes and pulling off her\nstockings, then running as best she could in the dress. She searched\nfrantically for a window big enough to fit through. She burst out into a\nlarger corridor, empty save for flickering torches.\nA massive lavender rose window stood on the far side of the room.\nGood enough, Vin thought. With a flare of steel, she threw herself into\nthe air, Pushing against a massive iron door behind her. She flew forward\nfor a moment, then Pushed powerfully against the rose window’s iron\nbindings.\nShe lurched to a stop in the air, Pushing both backward and forward at\nthe same time. She strained, hanging in the empty corridor, flaring her\npewter to keep from being crushed. The rose window was enormous, but it\nwas mostly glass. How strong could it be?\nVery strong. Vin groaned beneath the strain. She heard a snap behind her,\nand the door began to twist in its mountings.\nYou . . . must . . . give! she thought angrily, flaring her steel. Chips of\nstone fell around the window.\nThen, with a crack of sound, the rose window burst free from the stone\nwall. It fell backward into the dark night, and Vin shot out behind it.\nCool mist enveloped her. She Pulled slightly against the door inside the\nroom, keeping herself from going out too far, then Pushed mightily against\nthe falling window. The enormous dark-glassed window tumbled beneath\nher, churning the mists as Vin shot away from it. Straight up, toward the\nroof.\nThe window crashed to the ground just as Vin flew up over the edge of\nthe rooftop, her dress fluttering madly in the wind. She landed on the\nbronze-plated roof with a thump, falling to a crouch. The metal was cool\nbeneath her toes and fingers."

Where are they?\nThen, oddly, she thought she sensed something. An Allomantic pulse in\nthe night. Faint. Hidden. But enough.\nVin rose to dash across the rooftop, trusting her instincts. As she ran, she\nflared pewter and grabbed her dress near the neck, then ripped the garment\ndown the front with a single yank. She pulled her coin pouch and metal\nvials from a hidden pocket, and then—still running—she ripped the dress,\npetticoats, and attached leggings free, tossing it all aside. Her corset and\ngloves went next. Underneath, she wore a thin, sleeveless white shift and a\npair of white shorts.\nShe dashed frantically. I can’t be too late, she thought. Please. I can’t.\nFigures resolved in the mists ahead. They stood beside an angled rooftop\nskylight; Vin had passed several similar ones as she ran.

She\nlanded in the very center of the surprised group of people, then thrust her\ncoin pouch upward, ripping it in two.\nCoins sprayed into the air, reflecting light from the window below. As the\nglistening shower of metal fell around Vin, she Pushed.\nCoins zipped away from her like a swarm of insects, each one leaving a\ntrail in the mist. Figures cried out as coins hit flesh, and several of the dark\nforms dropped.\nSeveral did not. Some of the coins snapped away, Pushed aside by\ninvisible Allomantic hands. Four people remained standing: Two of them\nwore mistcloaks; one of them was familiar.\nShan Elariel. Vin didn’t need to see the cloak to understand; there was\nonly one reason a woman as important as Shan would come on an\nassassination like this. She was a Mistborn.\n“You?” Shan asked in shock. She wore a black outfit of trousers and shirt,\nher dark hair pulled back, her mistcloak worn almost stylishly.\nTwo Mistborn, Vin thought. Not good. She scrambled away, ducking as\none of the assassins swung a dueling cane at her.\nVin slid across the rooftop, then Pulled herself to a brief halt, spinning\nwith one hand resting against the cold bronze. She reached out and Pulled\nagainst the few coins that hadn’t escaped out into the night, yanking them\nback into her hand.\n“Kill her!” Shan snapped. The two men Vin had felled lay groaning on\nthe rooftop. They weren’t dead; in fact, one was climbing unsteadily to his\nfeet.\nThugs, Vin thought. The other two are probably Coinshots."

It’s time for me to go.\nShe couldn’t face two Mistborn at once—she couldn’t even beat Kelsier\nmost nights. Flaring Steel, Vin launched herself backward. Shan took a step\nforward and—looking determined—Pushed herself after Vin. The second\nMistborn joined her.\nBloody hell! Vin thought, spinning in the air and Pulling herself to the\nrooftop’s edge near where she had broken the rose window. Below, figures\nscrambled about, lanterns brightening the mists. Lord Venture probably\nthought that the fuss meant his son was dead. He was in for a surprise.\nVin launched herself into the air again, jumping out into the misty void.\nShe could hear the two Mistborn land behind her, then push off as well.\nThis isn’t good, Vin thought with trepidation as she hurled through the\nmisty air currents. She didn’t have any coins left, nor did she have daggers\n—and she faced two trained Mistborn."

A line of\nblue, moving slowly, appeared beneath her to the right.\nVin yanked on the line, changing her trajectory. She shot downward, the\nVenture grounds wall appearing as a dark shadow beneath her. Her anchor\nwas the breastplate of an unfortunate guard, who lay atop the wall, holding\nfrantically to a tooth in the battlements to keep himself from being pulled\nup toward Vin.\nVin slammed feet-first into the man, then spun in the misty air, flipping to\nland on the cool stone. The guard collapsed to the stone, then cried out,\ndesperately grabbing his stone anchor as another Allomantic force Pulled\nagainst him.\nSorry, friend, Vin thought, kicking the man’s hand free from the\nbattlement tooth. He immediately snapped upward, yanked into the air as if\npulled by a powerful tether.\nThe sound of bodies colliding sounded from the darkness above, and Vin\nsaw a pair of forms drop limply to the Venture courtyard. Vin smiled,\ndashing along the wall. I sure hope that was Shan.\nVin jumped up, landing atop the gatehouse. Near the keep, people were\nscattering, climbing in carriages to flee.\nAnd so the house war starts, Vin thought. Didn’t think I’d be the one to\nofficially begin it.\nA figure plummeted toward her from the mists above. Vin cried out,\nflaring pewter and jumping to the side. Shan landed dexterously—mistcloak\ntassels billowing—atop the gatehouse. She had both daggers out, and her\neyes burned with anger.\nVin jumped to the side, rolling off the gatehouse and landing on the\nwalltop below. A pair of guards jumped back in alarm, surprised to see a\nhalf-naked girl fall into their midst. Shan dropped to the wall behind them,\nthen Pushed, throwing one of the guards in Vin’s direction.\nThe man cried out as Vin Pushed against his breastplate as well—but he\nwas far heavier than she, and she was thrown backward. She Pulled on the\nguard to slow herself, and the man crashed down to the walltop. Vin landed\nlithely beside him, then grabbed his staff as it rolled free from his hand.\nShan attacked in a flash of spinning daggers, and Vin was forced to jump\nbackward again. She’s so good! Vin thought with anxiety. Vin herself had\nbarely trained with daggers; now she wished she’d asked Kelsier for a little\nmore practice. She swung the staff, but she’d never used one of the\nweapons before, and her attack was laughable.\nShan slashed, and Vin felt a flare of pain in her cheek as she dodged. She\ndropped the staff in shock, reaching up to her face and feeling blood. She\nstumbled back, seeing the smile on Shan’s face.\nAnd then Vin remembered the vial. The one she still carried—the one\nKelsier had given her.\nAtium.\nShe didn’t bother to grab it from the place she had tucked it at her waist."

Then, she\nimmediately burned iron and yanked on the bead of atium. The vial\nshattered, the bead heading back toward Vin. She caught it in her mouth,\nswallowing the lump and forcing it down.\nShan paused. Then, before Vin could do anything, she downed a vial of\nher own.\nOf course she has atium!\nBut, how much did she have? Kelsier hadn’t given Vin much—only\nenough for about thirty seconds. Shan jumped forward, smiling, her long\nblack hair flaring in the air. Vin gritted her teeth. She didn’t have much\nchoice.\nShe burned atium. Immediately, Shan’s form shot forth dozens of\nphantom atium shadows. It was a Mistborn standoff: The first one who ran\nout of atium would be vulnerable. You couldn’t escape an opponent who\nknew exactly what you were going to do.\nVin scrambled backward, keeping an eye on Shan. The noblewoman\nstalked forward, her phantoms forming an insane bubble of translucent\nmotion around her. She seemed calm. Secure.\nShe has plenty of atium, Vin thought, feeling her own storage burn away.\nI need to get away.\nA shadowy length of wood suddenly shot through Vin’s chest. She\nducked to the side just as the real arrow—apparently made with no\narrowhead—passed through the air where she had been standing. She\nglanced toward the gate-house, where several soldiers were raising bows.\nShe cursed, glancing to the side, into the mists. As she did so, she caught\na smile from Shan.\nShe’s just waiting for my atium to burn out. She wants me to run—she\nknows she can chase me down.\nThere was only one other option: attack.\nShan frowned in surprise as Vin dashed forward, phantom arrows\nsnapping against the stones just before their real counterparts arrived. Vin\ndodged between two arrows—her atium enhanced mind knowing exactly\nhow to move—passing so close that she could feel the missiles in the air to\neither side of her.\nShan swung her daggers, and Vin twisted to the side, dodging one slice\nand blocking the other with her forearm, earning a deep gash. Her own\nblood flew in the air as she spun—each droplet tossing out a translucent\natium image—and flared pewter, punching Shan square in the stomach.\nShan grunted in pain, bending slightly, but she didn’t fall.\nAtium’s almost gone, Vin thought desperately. Only a few seconds left.\nSo, she extinguished her atium early, exposing herself.\nShan smiled wickedly, coming up from her crouch, right-hand dagger\nswinging confidently. She assumed that Vin had run out of atium—and\ntherefore assumed that she was exposed. Vulnerable.\nAt that moment, Vin burned her last bit of atium. Shan paused just briefly\nin confusion, giving Vin an opening as a phantom arrow streaked through\nthe mists overhead.\nVin caught the real arrow as it followed—the grainy wood burning her"

The woman\nstumbled backward, staying on her feet.\nDamn pewter, Vin thought, ripping a sword from a sheath beside the\nunconscious soldier at her feet. She jumped forward, gritting her teeth in\ndetermination, and Shan—still dazed—raised a hand to Push against the\nsword.\nVin let the weapon go—it was just a distraction—as she slammed the\nsecond half of the broken arrow into Shan’s chest just beside its counterpart.\nThis time, Shan dropped. She tried to rise, but one of the shafts must\nhave done some serious damage to her heart, for her face paled. She\nstruggled for a moment, then fell lifeless to the stones.\nVin stood, breathing deeply as she wiped the blood from her cheek—only\nto realize that her bloody arm was just making her face worse.

One problem with\nworking at night was that he missed the evening gatherings in Clubs’s\nkitchen. Breeze and Ham continued their general banter.

I still have to—”\nThe outside kitchen door slammed open. Vin stood silhouetted by the\ndark mist, wearing nothing but her dressing undergarments—a flimsy white\nshirt and shorts. Both were sprayed with blood.\n“Vin!” Ham exclaimed, standing.\nHer cheek bore a long, thin gash, and she had a bandage tied on one\nforearm. “I’m fine,” she said wearily.\n“What happened to your dress?” Dockson immediately demanded.\n“You mean this?” Vin asked apologetically, holding up a ripped, soot-\nstained blue mass of cloth. “It . . . got in the way. Sorry, Dox.”\n“Lord Ruler, girl!” Breeze said. “Forget the dress—what happened to\nyou!”\nVin shook her head, shutting the door. Spook blushed furiously at her\noutfit, and Sazed immediately moved over, checking the wound on her\ncheek.\n“I think I did something bad,” Vin said. “I . . . kind of killed Shan\nElariel.”\n“You did what?” Kelsier asked as Sazed tisked quietly, leaving the small\ncheek cut alone as he undid the bandage on her arm.\nVin flinched slightly at Sazed’s ministrations. “She was Mistborn. We\nfought. I won.”\nYou killed a fully-trained Mistborn? Kelsier thought with shock. You’ve\npracticed for barely eight months!\n“Master Hammond,” Sazed requested, “would you fetch my healer’s\nbag?”\nHam nodded, rising.\n“You might want to grab her something to wear too,” Kelsier suggested.\n“I think poor Spook’s about to have a heart attack.”\n“What’s wrong with this?” Vin asked, nodding toward her clothing. “It’s\nnot that much more revealing than some of the thief’s clothing I’ve worn.”\n“Those are undergarments, Vin,” Dockson said.\n“So?”\n“It’s the principle of the matter,” Dockson said. “Young ladies do not run\naround in their undergarments, no matter how much those undergarments\nmay resemble regular clothing.”\nVin shrugged, sitting as Sazed held a bandage to her arm. She seemed . . .\nexhausted. And not just from the fighting. What else happened at that\nparty?\n“Where did you fight the Elariel woman?” Kelsier asked.\n“Outside Keep Venture,” Vin said, looking down. “I . . . think some of the\nguards spotted me. Some of the nobles might have too, I’m not certain.”\n“That’s going to be trouble,” Dockson said, sighing. “Of course, that\ncheek wound is going to be pretty obvious, even with makeup. Honestly,\nyou Allomancers . . . Don’t you ever worry about what you’re going to look\nlike the day after you get into one of these fights?”\n“I was kind of focused on staying alive, Dox,” Vin said.\n“He’s just complaining because he’s worried about you,” Kelsier said as"

She bore it without much visible discomfort—though she\nobviously had her pewter flared.\nShe looks so exhausted, Kelsier thought. She was such a frail-looking\nthing, mostly just arms and legs. Hammond put a cloak around her\nshoulders, but she appeared too tired to care.\nAnd I brought her into this.\nOf course, she should know better than to get herself into this kind of\ntrouble. Eventually, Sazed finished his efficient sewing, then tied a new\nbandage around the arm wound. He moved onto the cheek.\n“Why would you fight a Mistborn?” Kelsier asked sternly. “You should\nhave run. Didn’t you learn anything from your battle with the Inquisitors?”\n“I couldn’t get away without turning my back on her,” Vin said.\n“Besides, she had more atium than me. If I hadn’t attacked, she would have\nchased me down. I had to strike while we were equally matched.”\n“But how did you get into this in the first place?” Kelsier demanded.\n“Did she attack you?”\nVin glanced down at her feet. “I attacked first.”\n“Why?” Kelsier asked.\nVin sat for a moment, Sazed working on her cheek. “She was going to\nkill Elend,” she finally said.\nKelsier exhaled in exasperation. “Elend Venture? You risked your life—\nrisked the plan, and our lives—for that fool of a boy?”\nVin looked up, glaring at him. “Yes.”\n“What is wrong with you, girl?” Kelsier asked. “Elend Venture isn’t\nworth this.”\nShe stood angrily, Sazed backing away, the cloak falling the floor. “He’s\na good man!”\n“He’s a nobleman!”\n“So are you!” Vin snapped. She waved a frustrated arm toward the\nkitchen and the crew. “What do you think this is, Kelsier? The life of a\nskaa? What do any of you know about skaa? Aristocratic suits, stalking\nyour enemies in the night, full meals and nightcaps around the table with\nyour friends? That’s not the life of a skaa!”\nShe took a step forward, glaring at Kelsier. He blinked in surprise at the\noutburst.\n“What do you know about them, Kelsier?” she asked. “When’s the last\ntime you slept in an alley, shivering in the cold rain, listening to the beggar\nnext to you cough with a sickness you knew would kill him? When’s the\nlast time you had to lay awake at night, terrified that one of the men in your\ncrew would try to rape you?

You’re no skaa—you’re just noblemen\nwithout titles.”\nShe turned, stalking from the room. Kelsier watched her go, shocked,\nhearing her footsteps on the stairs. He stood, dumbfounded, feeling a\nsurprising flush of ashamed guilt.\nAnd, for once, found himself without anything to say.\nVin didn’t go to her room. She climbed to the roof, where the mists curled\nin the quiet, unlit night. She sat down in the corner, the rough stone lip of\nthe flat rooftop against her nearly bare back, wood beneath her.\nShe was cold, but she didn’t care. Her arm hurt a bit, but it was mostly\nnumb. She didn’t feel nearly numb enough herself.\nShe crossed her arms, huddling down, watching the mists. She didn’t\nknow what to think, let alone what to feel. She shouldn’t have exploded at\nKelsier, but everything that had happened . . . the fight, Elend’s betrayal . . .\nit just left her feeling frustrated. She needed to be angry at someone.\nYou should just be angry at yourself, Reen’s voice whispered. You’re the\none who let them get close. Now they’re all just going to leave you.\nShe couldn’t make it stop hurting. She could only sit and shiver as the\ntears fell, wondering how everything had collapsed so quickly.\nThe trapdoor to the rooftop opened with a quiet creak, and Kelsier’s head\nappeared.\nOh, Lord Ruler! I don’t want to face him now. She tried to wipe away her\ntears, but she only succeeded in aggravating the freshly stitched wound on\nher cheek.\nKelsier closed the trapdoor behind him, then stood, so tall and proud,\nstaring up at the mists. He didn’t deserve the things I said. None of them\ndid.\n“Watching the mists is comforting, isn’t it?” Kelsier asked.\nVin nodded.\n“What is it I once told you? The mists protect you, they give you power .\n. . they hide you. . . .”\nHe looked down, then he walked over and crouched before her, holding\nout a cloak. “There are some things you can’t hide from, Vin. I know—I’ve\ntried.”\nShe accepted the cloak, then wrapped it around her shoulders.\n“What happened tonight?” he asked. “What really happened?”\n“Elend told me that he didn’t want to be with me anymore.”\n“Ah,” Kelsier said, moving over to sit beside her. “Was this before or\nafter you killed his former fiancée?”\n“Before,” Vin said.\n“And you still protected him?”\nVin nodded, sniffling quietly. “I know.

He looked up into\nthe mists. “I loved Mare too, even after she betrayed me. Nothing could\nchange how I felt.”\n“And that’s why it hurts so much,” Vin said, remembering what Kelsier\nhad said before. I think I finally understand.\n“You don’t stop loving someone just because they hurt you,” he said. “It\nwould certainly make things easier if you did.”\nShe started to sniffle again, and he put a fatherly arm around her. She\npulled close, trying to use his warmth to push away the pain.\n“I loved him, Kelsier,” she whispered.\n“Elend? I know.”\n“No, not Elend,” Vin said. “Reen. He beat me over, and over, and over.\nHe swore at me, he yelled at me, he told me he’d betray me. Every day, I\nthought about how much I hated him.\n“And I loved him. I still do. It hurts so much to think that he’s gone, even\nthough he always told me he would leave.”\n“Oh, child,” Kelsier said, pulling her close. “I’m sorry.”\n“Everyone leaves me,” she whispered. “I can barely remember my\nmother. She tried to kill me, you know. She heard voices, in her head, and\nthey made her kill my baby sister. She was probably going to kill me next,\nbut Reen stopped her.\n“Either way, she left me. After that, I clung to Reen. He left too. I love\nElend, but he doesn’t want me anymore.” She looked up at Kelsier. “When\nare you going to go? When will you leave me?”\nKelsier looked sorrowful. “I . . . Vin, I don’t know. This job, the plan . . .”\nShe searched his eyes, looking for the secrets therein. What are you\nhiding from me, Kelsier? Something that dangerous? She wiped her eyes\nagain, pulling away from him, feeling foolish.\nHe looked down, shaking his head. “Look, now you got blood all over\nmy nice, dirty, pretend informant’s clothing.”\nVin smiled. “At least some of it is noble blood. I got Shan pretty good.”\nKelsier chuckled. “You’re probably right about me, you know. I don’t\ngive the nobility much of a chance, do I?”\nVin flushed. “Kelsier, I shouldn’t have said those things. You’re good\npeople, and this plan of yours . . . well, I realize what you’re trying to do for\nthe skaa.”\n“No, Vin,” Kelsier said, shaking his head. “What you said was true.\nWe’re not really skaa.”\n“But, that’s good,” Vin said. “If you were regular skaa, you wouldn’t\nhave the experience or courage to plan something like this.”\n“They might lack experience,” Kelsier said. “But not courage. Our army\nlost, true, but they were willing—with minimal training—to charge a\nsuperior force. No, the skaa don’t lack courage.

But now, after the\nthings she’d said below, she almost wished that she could just blow away\nlike a wisp of mist.\nI need to tell him. It could mean the plan’s success or failure. She took a\ndeep breath. “House Venture has a weakness, Kelsier.”\nHe perked up. “It does?”\nVin nodded. “Atium. They make certain the metal is harvested and\ndelivered—it’s the source of their wealth.”\nKelsier paused for a moment. “Of course! That’s how they can pay the\ntaxes, that’s why they’re so powerful. . . .

I’ll\ntry and think of another way, but as things stand now, Venture has to fall.”\n“I understand.”\n“I’m glad you told me, though.”\nShe nodded. And now I’ve betrayed him too. There was a peace in\nknowing, however, that she hadn’t done it out of spite. Kelsier was right:\nHouse Venture was a power that needed to be toppled. Oddly, her mention\nof the house seemed to bother Kelsier more than it did her. He sat, staring\ninto the mists, strangely melancholy. He reached down, absently scratching\nhis arm.\nThe scars, Vin thought. It isn’t House Venture he’s thinking about—it’s\nthe Pits. Her. “Kelsier?” she said.\n“Yes?” His eyes still looking a bit . . . absent as he watched the mists.\n“I don’t think that Mare betrayed you.”\nHe smiled. “I’m glad you think that way.”\n“No, I really mean it,” Vin said. “The Inquisitors were waiting for you\nwhen you got to the center of the palace, right?”\nKelsier nodded.\n“They were waiting for us too.”\nKelsier shook his head. “You and I fought some guards, made some\nnoise. When Mare and I went in, we were quiet. We’d planned for a year—\nwe were stealthy, secretive, and very careful. Someone set a trap for us.”\n“Mare was an Allomancer, right?” Vin asked. “They could have just\nsensed you coming.”"

They say the Lord Ruler doesn’t lie.\nWhy would he need to?”\nVin sat quietly for a moment, considering what he’d said. “Kelsier,” she\nsaid slowly, “I think that Inquisitors can sense our Allomancy even when\nwe’re burning copper.”\n“Impossible.”\n“I did it tonight. I punctured Shan’s coppercloud to locate her and the\nother assassins. That’s how I got to Elend in time.”\nKelsier frowned. “You’ve got to be mistaken.”\n“It happened before too,” Vin said. “I can feel the Lord Ruler’s touch on\nmy emotions, even when I’m burning copper. And I swear that when I was\nhiding from that Inquisitor who was hunting me, he found me when he\nshouldn’t have been able to. Kelsier, what if it’s possible? What if hiding\nyourself by Smoking isn’t just a simple matter of whether or not your\ncopper is on? What if it just depends on how strong you are?”\nKelsier sat thoughtfully. “It could be possible, I suppose.”\n“Then Mare wouldn’t have had to betray you!” Vin said eagerly.\n“Inquisitors are extremely powerful. The ones who were waiting for you,\nmaybe they just felt you burning metals! They knew that an Allomancer\nwas trying to sneak into the palace. Then, the Lord Ruler thanked her\nbecause she was the one who gave you away! She was the Allomancer,\nburning tin, that led them to you.”\nKelsier’s face took on a troubled expression. He turned, sitting himself so\nhe was directly in front of her. “Do it now, then. Tell me what metal I’m\nburning.”\nVin closed her eyes, flaring bronze, listening . . . feeling, as Marsh had\ntaught her.

You’re burning pewter.”\nKelsier blinked in surprise. “Impossible,” he whispered. “Again!”\nShe closed her eyes. “Tin,” she said after a moment. “Now steel—you\nchanged as soon as I spoke.”\n“Bloody hell!”\n“I was right,” Vin said eagerly. “You can feel Allomantic pulses through\ncopper! They’re quiet, but I guess you just have to focus hard enough to—”\n“Vin,” Kelsier interrupted. “Don’t you think Allomancers have tried this\nbefore? You don’t think that after a thousand years’time, someone would\nhave noticed that you could pierce a coppercloud? I’ve even tried it. I\nfocused for hours on my Master, trying to sense something through his\ncoppercloud.”\n“But . . .” Vin said. “But why . . .?”\n“It must have to do with strength, like you said. Inquisitors can Push and\nPull harder than any regular Mistborn—perhaps they’re so strong that they\ncan overwhelm someone else’s metal.”\n“But, Kelsier,” Vin said quietly. “I’m not an Inquisitor.”\n“But you’re strong,” he said. “Stronger than you have any right to be.\nYou killed a full Mistborn tonight!”\n“By luck,” Vin said, face flushing. “I just tricked her.”\n“Allomancy is nothing but tricks, Vin. No, there’s something special\nabout you. I noticed it on that first day, when you shrugged off my attempts\nto Push and Pull your emotions.”\nShe flushed. “It can’t be that, Kelsier. Maybe I’ve just practiced with\nbronze more than you. . . . I don’t know, I just . . .”\n“Vin,” Kelsier said, “you’re still too self-effacing. You’re good at this—\nthat much is obvious. If that’s why you can see through copperclouds . . .\nwell, I don’t know. But learn to take a little pride in yourself, kid! If there’s\nanything I can teach you, it’s how to be self-confident.”\nVin smiled.\n“Come on,” he said, standing and holding out a hand to help her up.\n“Sazed is going to fret all night if you don’t let him finish stitching that\ncheek wound, and Ham’s dying to hear about your battle. Good job leaving\nShan’s body back at Keep Venture, by the way—when House Elariel hears\nthat she was found dead on Venture property . . .”\nVin allowed him to pull her up, but she glanced toward the trapdoor\napprehensively. “I . . . don’t know if I want to go down yet, Kelsier. How\ncan I face them?”\nKelsier laughed. “Oh, don’t worry. If you didn’t say some stupid things\nevery once in a while, you certainly wouldn’t fit in with this group. Come\non.”\nVin hesitated, then let him lead her back down to the warmth of the\nkitchen.\n“Elend, how can you read at times like this?” Jastes asked.\nElend looked up from his book. “It calms me.”"

The young Lekal sat impatiently in the coach,\ntapping his fingers on the armrest. The window shades were drawn,\npartially to hide the light of Elend’s reading lantern, partially to keep out the\nmists. Though Elend would never admit it, the swirling fog made him just a\nbit nervous. Noblemen weren’t supposed to be afraid of such things, but\nthat didn’t change the fact that the deep, caliginous mist was just plain\ncreepy.\n“Your father is going to be livid when you get back,” Jastes noted, still\ntapping the armrest.\nElend shrugged, though this comment did make him a little bit nervous.\nNot because of his father, but because of what had happened this night.\nSome Allomancers had, apparently, been spying on Elend’s meeting with\nhis friends. What information had they gathered? Did they know about the\nbooks he’d read?\nFortunately, one of them had tripped, falling through Elend’s skylight.\nAfter that, it had been confusion and chaos—soldiers and ballgoers running\nabout in a semi-panic. Elend’s first thought had been for the books—the\ndangerous ones, the ones that if the obligators found he possessed, could get\nhim into serious trouble.\nSo, in the confusion, he’d dumped them all in a bag and followed Jastes\ndown to the palace side exit. Grabbing a carriage and sneaking out of the\npalace grounds had been an extreme move, perhaps, but it had been\nridiculously easy. With the number of carriages fleeing the Venture grounds,\nnot a single person had paused to notice that Elend himself was in the\ncarriage with Jastes.\nIt’s probably all died down by now, Elend told himself. People will\nrealize that House Venture wasn’t trying to attack them, and that there\nwasn’t really any danger. Just some spies who got careless.\nHe should have returned by now. However, his convenient absence from\nthe palace gave him a perfect excuse to check on another group of spies.\nAnd this time, Elend himself had sent them.\nA sudden knock on the door made Jastes jump, and Elend closed his\nbook, then opened the carriage door. Felt, one of the House Venture chief\nspies, climbed into the carriage, nodding his hawkish, mustached face\nrespectfully to Elend, then Jastes.\n“Well?” Jastes asked.\nFelt sat down with the keen litheness of his kind. “The building is\nostensibly a woodcrafter’s shop, m’lord. One of my men has heard of the\nplace—it’s run by one Master Cladent, a skaa carpenter of no small skill.”\nElend frowned. “Why did Valette’s steward come here?”\n“We think that the shop is a front, m’lord,” Felt said. “We’ve been\nobserving it ever since the steward led us here, as you ordered. However,\nwe’ve had to be very careful—there are several watchnests hidden on its\nroof and top floors.”\nElend frowned. “An odd precaution for a simple craftsman’s shop, I\nshould think.”"

We managed to sneak one\nof our best men up to the building itself—we don’t think he was spotted—\nbut he had a remarkably difficult time hearing what’s going on inside. The\nwindows are sealed and stuffed to keep in sound.”\nAnother odd precaution, Elend thought. “What do you think it means?”\nhe asked Felt.\n“It’s got to be an underground hideout, m’lord,” Felt said. “And a good\none. If we hadn’t been watching carefully, and been certain what to look for,\nwe would never have noticed the signs. My guess is that the men inside—\neven the Terrisman—are members of a skaa thieving crew. A very well-\nfunded and skilled one.”\n“A skaa thieving crew?” Jastes asked. “And Lady Valette too?”\n“Likely, m’lord,” Felt said.\nElend paused. “A . . . skaa thieving crew . . .” he said, stunned. Why\nwould they send one of their members to balls? To perform a scam of some\nsort, perhaps?\n“M’lord?” Felt asked. “Do you want us to break in? I’ve got enough men\nto take their entire crew.”\n“No,” Elend said. “Call your men back, and tell no one of what you’ve\nseen this night.”\n“Yes, m’lord,” Felt said, climbing out of the coach.\n“Lord Ruler!” Jastes said as the carriage door closed. “No wonder she\ndidn’t seem like a regular noblewoman. It wasn’t her rural upbringing—\nshe’s just a thief!”\nElend nodded, thoughtful, not certain what to think.\n“You owe me an apology,” Jastes said. “I was right about her, eh?”\n“Perhaps,” Elend said. “But . . . in a way, you were wrong about her too.\nShe wasn’t trying to spy on me—she was just trying to rob me.”\n“So?”\n“I . . . need to think about this,” Elend said, reaching out and knocking\nfor the carriage to start moving. He sat back as the coach began to roll back\ntoward Keep Venture.\nValette wasn’t the person that she’d said she was. However, he’d already\nprepared himself for that news. Not only had Jastes’s words about her made\nhim suspicious, Valette herself hadn’t denied Elend’s accusations earlier in\nthe night. It was obvious; she had been lying to him. Playing a part.\nHe should have been furious. He realized this, logically, and a piece of\nhim did ache of betrayal. But, oddly, the primary emotion he felt was one of\n. . . relief.\n“What?” Jastes asked, studying Elend with a frown.\nElend shook his head. “You’ve had me worrying over this for days,\nJastes. I felt so sick that I could barely function—all because I thought that\nValette was a traitor.”\n“But she is. Elend, she’s probably trying to scam you!”\n“Yes,” Elend said, “but at least she probably isn’t a spy for another"

In the face of all the intrigue, politics, and backbiting that has been\ngoing on lately, something as simple as a robbery feels slightly refreshing.”\n“But . . .”\n“It’s only money, Jastes.”\n“Money is kind of important to some of us, Elend.”\n“Not as important as Valette. That poor girl . . . all this time, she must\nhave been worrying about the scam she would have to pull on me!”\nJastes sat for a moment, then he finally shook his head. “Elend, only you\nwould be relieved to find out that someone was trying to steal from you.\nNeed I remind you that the girl has been lying this entire time? You might\nhave grown attached to her, but I doubt her own feelings are genuine.”\n“You may be right,” Elend admitted. “But . . . I don’t know, Jastes. I feel\nlike I know this girl. Her emotions . . . they just seem too real, too honest, to\nbe false.”\n“Doubtful,” Jastes said.\nElend shook his head. “We don’t have enough information to judge her\nyet. Felt thinks she’s a thief, but there have to be other reasons a group like\nthat would send someone to balls. Maybe she’s just an informant. Or,\nmaybe she is a thief—but not one who ever intended to rob me. She spent\nan awful lot of time mixing with the other nobility—why would she do that\nif I was her target? In fact, she spent relatively little time with me, and she\nnever plied me for gifts.”\nHe paused—imagining his meeting Valette as a pleasant accident, an\nevent that had thrown a terrible twist into both of their lives. He smiled,\nthen shook his head. “No, Jastes. There’s more here than we’re seeing.\nSomething about her still doesn’t make sense.”\n“I . . . suppose, El,” Jastes said, frowning.\nElend sat upright, a sudden thought occurring to him—a thought that\nmade his speculations about Valette’s motivation seem far less important.\n“Jastes,” he said. “She’s skaa!”\n“And?”\n“And she fooled me—fooled us both. She acted the part of an aristocrat\nalmost perfectly.”\n“An inexperienced aristocrat, perhaps.”\n“I had a real skaa thief with me!” Elend said. “Think of the questions I\ncould have asked her.”\n“Questions? What kind of questions?”\n“Questions about being skaa,” Elend said. “That’s not the point. Jastes,\nshe fooled us. If we can’t tell the difference between a skaa and a\nnoblewoman, that means that the skaa can’t be very different from us. And,\nif they’re not that different from us, what right do we have treating them as\nwe do?”\nJastes shrugged. “Elend, I don’t think you’re looking at this in\nperspective.

Too hard?\nHe had wanted her to believe, totally and completely, that he didn’t want\nanything more to do with her. Part of that had been genuine, for his own\nworries had convinced him that she couldn’t be trusted. And she couldn’t\nbe, not at the moment. Either way, he’d wanted her to leave the city. He’d\nthought that the best thing to do was break off the relationship until the\nhouse war was through.\nBut, assuming she’s really not a noblewoman, then there’s no reason for\nher to leave.\n“Elend?” Jastes asked. “Are you even paying attention to me?”\nElend looked up. “I think I did something wrong tonight. I wanted to get\nValette out of Luthadel. But, now I think I hurt her for no reason.”\n“Bloody hell, Elend!” Jastes said. “Allomancers were listening to our\nconference this night. Do you realize what could have happened? What if\nthey’d decided to kill us, rather than just spy on us?”\n“Ah, yes, you’re right,” Elend said with a distracted nod. “It’s best if\nValette leaves anyway. Anyone close to me will be in danger during the\ndays to come.”\nJastes paused, his annoyance deepening, then he finally laughed. “You’re\nhopeless.”\n“I try my best,” Elend said. “But, seriously, there’s no use worrying. The\nspies gave themselves away, and likely got chased off—or even captured—\nin the chaos. We now know some of the secrets that Valette is hiding, so\nwe’re ahead there too. It’s been a very productive night!”\n“That’s an optimistic way of looking at it, I guess. . . .”\n“Once again, I try my best.” Even still, he would feel more comfortable\nwhen they got back to Keep Venture. Perhaps it had been foolhardy to sneak\naway from the palace before hearing the details of what had happened, but\nElend hadn’t exactly been thinking carefully at the time. Besides, he’d had\nthe previously arranged meeting with Felt to attend, and the chaos had made\na perfect opportunity to slip away.\nThe carriage slowly pulled up to the Venture gates. “You should go,”\nElend said, slipping out of the carriage door. “Take the books.”\nJastes nodded, grabbing the sack, then bidding Elend farewell as he shut\nthe carriage door. Elend waited as the carriage rolled back away from the\ngates, then he turned and walked the rest of the way to the keep, the\nsurprised gate guards letting him pass with ease.\nThe grounds were still ablaze with light. Guards were already waiting for\nhim at the front of the keep, and a group of them rushed out into the mists\nto meet him. And surround him.\n“My lord, your father—”\n“Yes,” Elend interrupted, sighing. “I assume I’m to be taken to him\nimmediately?”\n“Yes, my lord.”\n“Lead on, then, Captain.”\nThey entered through the lord’s entrance on the side of the building.

They were noblemen, so Venture couldn’t\nexecute them, but he was very fond of the more brutal disciplinary forms.\nLord Venture dismissed the soldiers with a sharp gesture, then turned to\nElend with hostile eyes. Elend frowned, watching the soldiers go.\nEverything all seemed a little too . . . tense.\n“Well?” Lord Venture demanded.\n“Well what?”\n“Where have you been?”\n“Oh, I left,” Elend said offhandedly.\nLord Venture sighed. “Fine. Endanger yourself if you wish, boy. In a\nway, it’s too bad that Mistborn didn’t catch you—they could have saved me\na great deal of frustration.”\n“Mistborn?” Elend asked, frowning. “What Mistborn?”\n“The one that was planning to assassinate you,” Lord Venture snapped.\nElend blinked in startlement. “So . . . it wasn’t just a spying team?”\n“Oh, no,” Venture said, smiling somewhat wickedly. “An entire\nassassination team, sent here after you and your friends.”\nLord Ruler! Elend thought, realizing how foolish he had been to go out\nalone. I didn’t expect the house war to get so dangerous so quickly! At least,\nnot for me . . .\n“How do we know it was a Mistborn?” Elend asked, gathering his wits.\n“Our guards managed to kill her,” Straff said. “As she was fleeing.”\nElend frowned. “A full Mistborn? Killed by common soldiers?”\n“Archers,” Lord Venture said. “Apparently, they took her by surprise.”\n“And the man who fell through my skylight?” Elend asked.\n“Dead,” Lord Venture said. “Broken neck.”\nElend frowned. That man was still alive when we fled. What are you\nhiding, Father? “The Mistborn. Anyone I know?”\n“I’d say so,” Lord Venture said, settling into his desk chair, not looking\nup. “It was Shan Elariel.”\nElend froze in shock. Shan? he thought, dumbfounded. They’d been\nengaged, and she’d never even mentioned that she was an Allomancer. That\nprobably meant . . .\nShe’d been a plant all along. Perhaps House Elariel had planned to have\nElend killed once an Elariel grandson was born to the house title.\nYou’re right, Jastes. I can’t avoid politics by ignoring it. I’ve been a part\nof it all for much longer than I assumed.\nHis father was obviously pleased with himself. A high-profile member of\nHouse Elariel was dead on Venture grounds after trying to assassinate\nElend. . . . With such a triumph, Lord Venture would be insufferable for\ndays.\nElend sighed. “Did we capture any of the assassins alive, then?”\nStraff shook his head. “One fell to the courtyard as he was trying to flee.\nHe got away—he might have been Mistborn too. We found one man dead\non the roof, but we aren’t sure if there were others in the team or not.” He\npaused.\n“What?” Elend asked, reading the slight confusion in his father’s eyes."

A third Mistborn, fighting the other two . . . “Maybe\nsomeone found out about the assassination and tried to stop it.”\nLord Venture snorted. “Why would someone else’s Mistborn try to\nprotect you?”\n“Maybe they just wanted to stop an innocent man from being murdered.”\nLord Venture shook his head, laughing. “You are an idiot, boy. You\nunderstand that, right?”\nElend flushed, then turned away. It didn’t appear that Lord Venture\nwanted anything more, so Elend left. He couldn’t go back to his rooms, not\nwith the broken window and the guards, so he made his way to a guest\nbedroom, calling for a set of hazekillers to watch outside his door and\nbalcony—just in case.\nHe prepared for bed, thinking about the conversation. His father was\nprobably right about the third Mistborn. That just wasn’t the way things\nworked.\nBut . . . that’s the way it should be. The way it could be, maybe.\nThere were so many things Elend wished he could do. But, his father was\nhealthy, and young for a lord of his power. It would be decades before\nElend assumed the house title, assuming he even survived that long. He\nwished he could go to Valette, talk to her, explain his frustrations. She’d\nunderstand what he was thinking; for some reason, she always seemed to\nunderstand him better than others.\nAnd, she’s skaa! He couldn’t get over the thought. He had so many\nquestions, so many things he wanted to find out from her.\nLater, he thought as he climbed into bed. For now, focus on keeping the\nhouse together. His words to Valette in that area hadn’t been false—he\nneeded to make certain his family survived the house war.\nAfter that . . . well, perhaps they could find a way to work around the lies\nand the scams.\nThough many Terrismen express a resentment of Khlennium, there is also envy. I have heard the packmen speak in wonder of the Khlenni cathedrals, with their amazing\nstained-glass windows and broad halls. They also seem very fond of our fashion—back in the cities, I saw that many young Terrismen had traded in their furs and skins for\nwell-tailored gentlemen’s suits.\n32\nT C shop, there was a building of unusual height compared\nWO STREETS OVER FROM LUBS’S\nwith those surrounding it.

As the crew’s best Tineye, he usually\ngot the most important watches. Recently, those were the ones during the\nearly evening. That was the time when conflict among the Great Houses\nwas most likely to turn to outright fighting.\n“Are they still going at it?” Vin asked quietly, flaring her tin, scanning the\ncity. A bright haze shone in the distance, giving the mists a strange\nluminescence.\nSpook nodded, pointing toward the light. “Keep Hasting. Elariel soldiers\nwith the attacking tonight.”\nVin nodded. Keep Hasting’s destruction had been expected for some time\n—it had suffered a half-dozen raids from different houses during the last\nweek. Allies withdrawing, finances wrecked, it was only a matter of time\nbefore it fell.\nOddly, none of the houses attacked during the daytime. There was a\nfeigned air of secrecy about the war, as if the aristocracy acknowledged the\nLord Ruler’s dominance, and didn’t want to upset him by resorting to\ndaylight warfare. It was all handled at night, beneath a cloak of mists.\n“Wasing the want of this,” Spook said.\nVin paused. “Uh, Spook. Could you try to speak . . . normal?”\nSpook nodded toward a distant, dark structure in the distance. “The Lord\nRuler. Liking he wants the fighting.”\nVin nodded. Kelsier was right. There hasn’t been much of an outcry from\nthe Ministry or the palace regarding the house war, and the Garrison is\ntaking its time getting back to Luthadel. The Lord Ruler expected the house\nwar—and intends to let it run its course. Like a wildfire, left to blaze and\nrenew a field.\nExcept this time, as one fire died, another would start—Kelsier’s attack\non the city.\nAssuming Marsh can find out how to stop the Steel Inquisitors. Assuming\nwe can take the palace. And, of course, assuming Kelsier can find a way to\ndeal with the Lord Ruler . . .\nVin shook her head. She didn’t want to think poorly of Kelsier, but she\njust didn’t see how it was all going to happen. The Garrison wasn’t back\nyet, but reports said it was close, perhaps only a week or two out. Some\nnoble houses were falling, but there didn’t seem to be the air of general\nchaos that Kelsier had wanted. The Final Empire was strained, but she\ndoubted that it would crack.\nHowever, maybe that wasn’t the point. The crew had done an amazing\njob of instigating a house war; three entire Great Houses were no more, and\nthe rest were seriously weakened. It would take decades for the aristocracy\nto recover from their own squabbling.\nWe’ve done an amazing job, Vin decided. Even if we don’t attack the\npalace—or if that attack fails—we’ll have accomplished something\nwonderful.\nWith Marsh’s intelligence about the Ministry and Sazed’s translation of\nthe logbook, the rebellion would have new and useful information for future\nresistance.

Perhaps, in the future, she could help start a real rebellion—one in\na place where the skaa weren’t quite so beaten down.\nIf such a place exists . . . Vin was beginning to understand that it wasn’t\njust Luthadel and its Soothing stations that made skaa subservient. It was\neverything—the obligators, the constant work in field and mill, the mind-set\nencouraged by a thousand years of oppression. There was a reason why\nskaa rebellions were always so small.

Letting me see, letting\nme hear, letting me feel.”\n“Any tips you can pass on?” Vin asked hopefully.\nHe paused thoughtfully, sitting by the edge of the slanted rooftop, one\nfoot dangling over the side. “Tin burning . . .

They both jumped and\nducked down, and Kelsier chuckled as he walked across the rooftop. “We\nreally have to find a better way of warning people that we’re coming up.\nEvery time I visit a spynest, I worry that I’m going to startle someone off\nthe rooftop.”\nVin stood, dusting off her clothing. She wore mistcloak, shirt, and\ntrousers; it had been days since she’d worn a dress. She only put in token\nappearances at Mansion Renoux. Kelsier was too worried about assassins to\nlet her stay there for long.\nAt least we bought Kliss’s silence, Vin thought, annoyed at the expense.\n“It’s time?” she asked.\nKelsier nodded. “Nearly so, at least. I want to stop somewhere on the\nway.”\nVin nodded. For their second meeting, Marsh had chosen a location that\nhe was supposedly scouting for the Ministry. It was a perfect opportunity to\nmeet, since Marsh had an excuse to be in the building all night, ostensibly\nSeeking for any Allomantic activity nearby. He would have a Soother with\nhim for a good deal of the time, but there would be an opening near the\nmiddle of the night when Marsh figured he would have a good hour alone.\nNot much time if he had to sneak out and back, but plenty of time for a pair\nof stealthy Mistborn to pay him a quick visit.\nThey bid farewell to Spook and Pushed off into the night. However, they\ndidn’t travel the rooftops for long before Kelsier led them down onto the\nstreet, landing and walking to conserve strength and metals.\nIt’s kind of odd, Vin thought, remembering her first night practicing\nAllomancy with Kelsier. I don’t even think of the empty streets as creepy\nanymore.\nThe cobblestones were slick from mistwater, and the deserted street\neventually disappeared into the distant haze. It was dark, silent, and lonely;\neven the war hadn’t changed very much. Soldier groups, when they\nattacked, went in clumps, striking quickly and trying to overrun the\ndefenses of an enemy house.\nYet, despite the emptiness of the nighttime city, Vin felt comfortable in it.\nThe mists were with her.\n“Vin,” Kelsier said as they walked. “I want to thank you.”\nShe turned to him, a tall, proud figure in a majestic mist-cloak. “Thank\nme? Why?”\n“For the things you said about Mare. I’ve been thinking a lot about that\nday . . . about her. I don’t know if your ability to see through copperclouds"

I don’t know if your ability to see through copperclouds\nexplains everything, but . . . well, given the choice, I’d rather believe that\nMare didn’t betray me.”\nVin nodded, smiling.\nHe shook his head ruefully. “It sounds foolish, doesn’t it? As if . . . all\nthese years, I’ve just been waiting for a reason to give in to self-delusion.”\n“I don’t know,” Vin said. “Once, maybe I would have thought you a fool,\nbut . . . well, that’s kind of what trust is, isn’t it? A willful self-delusion?\nYou have to shut out that voice that whispers about betrayal, and just hope\nthat your friends aren’t going to hurt you.”\nKelsier chuckled. “I don’t think you’re helping the argument any, Vin.”\nShe shrugged. “Makes sense to me. Distrust is really the same thing—\nonly on the other side. I can see how a person, given the choice between\ntwo assumptions, would choose to trust.”\n“But not you?” Kelsier asked.\nVin shrugged again. “I don’t know anymore.”\nKelsier hesitated. “This . . . Elend of yours. There’s a chance that he was\njust trying to scare you into leaving the city, right? Perhaps he said those\nthings for your own good.”\n“Maybe,” Vin said. “But, there was something different about him . . .\nabout the way he looked at me. He knew I was lying to him, but I don’t\nthink he realized that I was skaa. He probably thought I was a spy from one\nof the other houses. Either way, he seemed honest in his desire to be rid of\nme.”\n“Maybe you thought that because you were already convinced that he\nwas going to leave you.”\n“I . . .” Vin trailed off, glancing down at the slick, ashen street as they\nwalked. “I don’t know—and it’s your fault, you know. I used to understand\neverything. Now it’s all confused.”\n“Yes, we’ve messed you up right properly,” Kelsier said with a smile.\n“You don’t seem bothered by the fact.”\n“Nope,” Kelsier said. “Not a bit. Ah, here we are.”\nHe stopped beside a large, wide building—probably another skaa\ntenement. It was dark inside; skaa couldn’t afford lamp oil, and they would\nhave put out the building’s central hearth after preparing the evening meal.\n“This?” Vin asked uncertainly.\nKelsier nodded, walking up to tap lightly on the door. To Vin’s surprise, it\nopened hesitantly, a wiry skaa face peeking out into the mists.\n“Lord Kelsier!” the man said quietly.\n“I told you I’d visit,” Kelsier said, smiling. “Tonight seemed like a good\ntime.”\n“Come in, come in,” the man said, pulling the door open. He stepped\nback, careful not to let any of the mist touch him as Kelsier and Vin entered.\nVin had been in skaa tenements before, but never before had they seemed\nso . . . depressing.

The smell of smoke and unwashed bodies was almost\noverpowering, and she had to extinguish her tin to keep from gagging. The\nwan light of a small coal stove showed a crowd of people packed together,\nsleeping on the floor. They kept the room swept of ash, but there was only\nso much they could do—black stains still covered clothing, walls, and\nfaces. There were few furnishings, not to mention far too few blankets to go\naround.\nI used to live like this, Vin thought with horror. The crew lairs were just\nas packed—sometimes more so. This . . . was my life.\nPeople roused as they saw that they had a visitor. Kelsier had his sleeves\nrolled up, Vin noticed, and the scars on his arms were visible even by\nemberlight. They stood out starkly, running lengthwise up from his wrist\npast his elbows, crisscrossing and overlapping.\nThe whispers began immediately.\n“The Survivor . . .”\n“He’s here!”\n“Kelsier, the Lord of the Mists . . .”\nThat’s a new one, Vin thought with a raised eyebrow. She stayed back as\nKelsier smiled, stepping forward to meet the skaa. The people gathered\naround him with quiet excitement, reaching out to touch his arms and cloak.\nOthers just stood and stared, watching him with reverence.\n“I come to spread hope,” Kelsier said to them quietly. “House Hasting\nfell tonight.”\nThere were murmurs of surprise and awe.\n“I know many of you worked in the Hasting smithies and steel mills,”\nKelsier said. “And, honestly, I cannot say what this means for you. But it is\na victory for all of us. For a time, at least, your men won’t die before the\nforges or beneath the whips of Hasting taskmasters.”\nThere were murmurs through the small crowd, and one voice finally\nspoke the concern loud enough for Vin to hear. “House Hasting is gone?\nWho will feed us?”\nSo frightened, Vin thought. I was never like that . . . was I?\n“I’ll send you another shipment of food,” Kelsier promised. “Enough to\nlast you for a while, at least.”\n“You’ve done so much for us,” another man said.\n“Nonsense,” Kelsier said. “If you wish to repay me, then stand up just a\nlittle straighter. Be a little less afraid. They can be beaten.”\n“By men like you, Lord Kelsier,” a woman whispered. “But not by us.”\n“You’d be surprised,” Kelsier said as the crowd began to make way for\nparents bringing their children forward. It seemed like everyone in the room\nwanted their sons to meet Kelsier personally. Vin watched with mixed\nfeelings. The crew still had reservations regarding Kelsier’s rising fame\nwith the skaa, though they kept their word and remained silent.\nHe really does seem to care for them, Vin thought, watching Kelsier pick\nup a small child. I don’t think it’s just a show. This is how he is—he loves\npeople, loves the skaa. But . . . it’s more like the love of a parent for a child\nthan it is like the love of a man for his equals."

He was, after all, a kind of father to the skaa. He was\nthe noble lord they always should have had. Still, Vin couldn’t help feeling\nuncomfortable as she watched the faintly illuminated, dirty faces of those\nskaa families, their eyes worshipful and reverent.\nKelsier eventually bid the group farewell, telling them he had an\nappointment. Vin and he left the cramped room, stepping out into blessedly\nfresh air. Kelsier remained quiet as they traveled toward Marsh’s new\nSoothing station, though he did walk with a bit more of a spring in his step.\nEventually, Vin had to say something. “You visit them often?”\nKelsier nodded. “At least a couple of houses a night. It breaks up the\nmonotony of my other work.”\nKilling noblemen and spreading false rumors, Vin thought. Yes, visiting\nthe skaa would be a nice break.\nThe meeting place was only a few streets away. Kelsier paused in a\ndoorway as they approached, squinting in the dark night. Finally, he pointed\nat a window, just faintly lit. “Marsh said he’d leave a light burning if the\nother obligators were gone.”\n“Window or stairs?” Vin asked.\n“Stairs,” Kelsier said. “The door should be unlocked, and the Ministry\nowns the entire building. It will be empty.”\nKelsier was right on both counts. The building didn’t smell musty enough\nto be abandoned, but the bottom few floors were obviously unused. Vin and\nhe quickly climbed up the stairwell.\n“Marsh should be able to tell us the Ministry reaction to the House War,”\nKelsier said as they reached the top floor. Lanternlight flickered through the\ndoor at the top, and he pushed it open, still speaking. “Hopefully, that\nGarrison won’t get back too quickly. The damage is mostly done, but I’d\nlike the war to go on for—”\nHe froze in the doorway, blocking Vin’s view.\nShe flared pewter and tin immediately, falling to a crouch, listening for\nattackers. There was nothing. Just silence.\n“No . . .” Kelsier whispered.\nThen Vin saw the trickle of dark red liquid seeping around the side of\nKelsier’s foot. It pooled slightly, then began to drip down the first step.\nOh, Lord Ruler . . .\nKelsier stumbled into the room. Vin followed, but she knew what she’d\nsee. The corpse lay near the center of the chamber, flayed and dismembered,\nthe head completely crushed. It was barely recognizable as human. The\nwalls were sprayed red.\nCould one body really produce this much blood? It was just like before,\nin the basement of Camon’s lair—only with a single victim.\n“Inquisitor,” Vin whispered.\nKelsier, heedless of the gore, stumbled to his knees beside Marsh’s\ncorpse. He raised a hand as if to touch the skinless body, but remained\nfrozen there, stunned.\n“Kelsier,” Vin said urgently. “This was recent—the Inquisitor could still\nbe near.”\nHe didn’t move."

His eyes met hers, and lucidity returned.\nHe stumbled to his feet.\n“Window,” Vin said, rushing across the room. She paused, however,\nwhen she saw something sitting on a small desk beside the wall. A wooden\ntable leg, tucked half-hidden beneath a blank sheet of paper. Vin snatched it\nas Kelsier reached the window.\nHe turned back, looking over the room one last time, then jumped out\ninto the night.\nFarewell, Marsh, Vin thought regretfully, following.\n“ ‘I think that the Inquisitors suspect me,’ ” Dockson read. The paper—a\nsingle sheet recovered from inside the table leg—was clean and white, free\nfrom the blood that stained Kelsier’s knees and the bottom of Vin’s cloak.\nDockson continued, reading as he sat at Clubs’s kitchen table. “ ‘I’ve\nbeen asking too many questions, and I know they sent at least one message\nto the corrupt obligator who supposedly trained me as an acolyte. I thought\nto seek out the secrets that the rebellion has always needed to know. How\ndoes the Ministry recruit Mistborn to be Inquisitors? Why are Inquisitors\nmore powerful than regular Allomancers? What, if any, are their\nweaknesses?\n“ ‘Unfortunately, I’ve learned next to nothing about the Inquisitors—\nthough the politicking within the regular Ministry ranks continues to amaze\nme. It’s like the regular obligators don’t even care about the world outside,\nexcept for the prestige they earn by being the most clever or successful in\napplying the Lord Ruler’s dictates.\n“ ‘The Inquisitors, however, are different. They are far more loyal to the\nLord Ruler than the regular obligators—and this is, perhaps, part of the\ndissension between the two groups.\n“ ‘Regardless, I feel that I am close. They do have a secret, Kelsier. A\nweakness. I’m sure of it. The other obligators whisper of it, though none of\nthem know it.\n“ ‘I fear that I’ve prodded too much. The Inquisitors tail me, watch me,\nask after me. So, I prepare this note. Perhaps my caution is unnecessary.\n“ ‘Perhaps not.’ ”\nDockson looked up. “That’s . . . all it says.”\nKelsier stood at the far side of the kitchen, back to the cupboard,\nreclining in his usual position. But . . . there was no levity in his posture this\ntime. He stood with arms folded, head slightly bowed. His disbelieving\ngrief appeared to have vanished, replaced with another emotion—one Vin\nhad sometimes seen smoldering darkly behind his eyes. Usually when he\nspoke of the nobility.\nShe shivered despite herself. Standing as he was, she was suddenly aware\nof his clothing—dark gray mistcloak, long-sleeved black shirt, charcoal\ntrousers. In the night, the clothing was simply camouflage. In the lit room,\nhowever, the black colors made him look menacing.\nHe stood up straight, and the room grew tense."

Send a Thug\nand a Tineye with him as protection, but tell him to abandon his canal boats\none day out of the city, then return to us.”\nDockson paused, then glanced at Vin and the others. “Okay . . .”\n“Marsh knew everything, Dox,” Kelsier said. “They broke him before\nthey killed him—that’s how Inquisitors work.”\nHe let the words hang. Vin felt a chill. The lair was compromised.\n“To the backup lair, then?” Dockson asked. “Only you and I knew its\nlocation.”\nKelsier nodded firmly. “I want everyone out of this shop, apprentices\nincluded, in fifteen minutes. I’ll meet you at the backup lair in two days.”\nDockson looked up at Kelsier, frowning. “Two days? Kell, what are you\nplanning?”\nKelsier strode over to the door. He threw it open, letting in the mist, then\nglanced back at the crew with eyes as hard as any Inquisitor’s spikes.\n“They hit me where it couldn’t have hurt worse. I’m going to do\nlikewise.”\nWalin pushed himself in the darkness, feeling his way through the cramped\ncaverns, forcing his body through cracks nearly too small.

He lay with his torso pinched in a tight rift in the rock, and had\nbeen in the process of wiggling his way through. However, his fingers—\nalways searching, even when he was barely conscious—had been feeling\nthe walls. And they’d found something.\nHis hand quivered with anticipation as he felt the crystal buds. Yes, yes,\nthat was them. They grew in a wide, circular pattern on the wall; they were\nsmall at the edges, but got gradually bigger near the center. At the direct\nmiddle of the circular pattern, the crystals curved inward, following a\npocketlike hollow in the wall. Here, the crystals grew long, each one having\na jagged, sharp edge. Like teeth lining the maw of a stone beast.\nTaking a breath, praying to the Lord Ruler, Walin rammed his hand into\nthe fist-sized, circular opening. The crystals ripped his arm, tearing long,\nshallow gashes in his skin. He ignored the pain, forcing his arm in further,\nup to his elbow, searching with his fingers for . . .\nThere! His fingers found a small rock at the center of the pocket—a rock\nformed by the mysterious drippings of the crystals. A Hathsin geode.\nHe grasped it eagerly, pulling it out, ripping his arm again as he withdrew\nit from the crystal-lined hole. He cradled the small rock sphere, breathing\nheavily with joy.\nAnother seven days. He would live another seven days.\nBefore hunger and fatigue could weaken him further, Walin began the\nlaborious climb back upward. He squeezed through crevasses, climbed up\njuttings in walls. Sometimes he had to move to the right or left until the\nceiling opened up, but it always did. There were really only two directions:\nup and down.\nHe kept a wary ear out for others. He had seen climbers killed before,\nslain by younger, stronger men who hoped to steal a geode. Fortunately, he\nmet nobody. It was good. He was an older man—old enough to know that\nhe never should have tried to steal food from his plantation lord.\nPerhaps he had earned his punishment. Perhaps he deserved to die in the\nPits of Hathsin.\nBut I won’t die today, he thought, finally smelling sweet, fresh air. It was\nnight above. He didn’t care. The mists didn’t bother him anymore—even\nbeatings didn’t bother him much anymore. He was just too tired to care.\nWalin began to climb out of the crack—one of dozens in the small, flat\nvalley known as the Pits of Hathsin. Then he froze.\nA man stood above him in the night. He was dressed in a large cloak that\nappeared to have been shredded to strips. The man looked at Walin, quiet\nand powerful in his black clothing. Then he reached down.\nWalin cringed. The man, however, grabbed Walin’s hand and pulled him\nout of the crack.\n“Go!” the man said quietly in the swirling mists. “Most of the guards are\ndead. Gather as many prisoners as you can, and escape this place. You have\na geode?”\nWalin cringed again, pulling his hand toward his chest.\n“Good,” the stranger said. “Break it open.

Sell it to the underground in whatever city you\neventually find yourself; you should earn enough to live on for years. Go\nquickly! I don’t know how long you have until an alarm is raised.”\nWalin stumbled back, confused. “Who . . . who are you?”\n“I am what you will soon be,” the stranger said, stepping up to the rift.\nThe ribbons of his enveloping black cloak billowed around him, mixing\nwith the mists as he turned toward Walin. “I am a survivor.”\nKelsier looked down, studying the dark scar in the rock, listening as the\nprisoner scrambled away in the distance.\n“And so I return,” Kelsier whispered. His scars burned, and memories\nreturned. Memories of months spent squeezing through cracks, of ripping\nhis arms on crystalline knives, of seeking each day to find a geode . . . just\none, so that he could live on.\nCould he really go back down into those cramped, quiet depths? Could\nhe enter the darkness again? Kelsier held up his arms, looking at the scars,\nstill white and stark on his arms.\nYes. For her dreams, he could.\nHe stepped over to the rift and forced himself to climb down inside of it.\nThen he burned tin. Immediately, he heard a cracking sound from below.\nTin illuminated the rift beneath him. Though the crack widened, it also\nbranched, sending out twisting rifts in all directions. Part cavern, part crack,\npart tunnel. He could already see his first crystalline atium-hole—or what\nwas left of it. The long, silvery crystals were fractured and broken.\nUsing Allomancy near atium crystals caused them to shatter. That was\nwhy the Lord Ruler had to use slaves, and not Allomancers, to collect his\natium for him.\nNow the real test, Kelsier thought, squeezing down further into the crack.\nHe burned iron, and immediately he saw several blue lines pointing\ndownward, toward atium-holes. Though the holes themselves probably\ndidn’t have an atium geode in them, the crystals themselves gave off faint\nblue lines. They contained residual amounts of atium.\nKelsier focused on one of the blue lines and Pulled lightly. His tin\nenhanced ears heard something shatter in the crack beneath him.\nKelsier smiled.\nNearly three years before, standing over the bloody corpses of the\ntaskmasters who had beaten Mare to death, he had first noticed that he\ncould use iron to sense where crystal pockets were. He’d barely understood\nhis Allomantic powers at the time, but even then, a plan had begun to form\nin his mind. A plan for vengeance.\nThat plan had evolved, growing to encompass so much more than he’d\noriginally intended. However, one of its key parts had remained sequestered\naway in a corner of his mind. He could find the crystal pockets. He could\nshatter them, using Allomancy.\nAnd they were the only means of producing atium in the entire Final\nEmpire.\nYou tried to destroy me, Pits of Hathsin, he thought, climbing down\nfurther into the rift.

We’ll\nnever get the Lord Ruler out of the city now, and we’ll certainly never get\nhim to send the palace guard into the city. It doesn’t look good, Vin.”\nVin sat quietly, digesting the information. Ham sat cross-legged on the\ndirty floor, leaning against the bricks of the far wall. The backup lair was a\ndank cellar with only three rooms, and the air smelled of dirt and ash.\nClubs’s apprentices took up one room to themselves, though Dockson had\nsent away all of the other servants before coming to the safe house.\nBreeze stood by the far wall. He occasionally shot uncomfortable looks\nat the dirty floor and dusty stools, but then decided to remain standing. Vin\ndidn’t see why he bothered—it was going to be impossible to keep his suits\nclean while living in what was, essentially, a pit in the ground.\nBreeze wasn’t the only one taking their self-imposed captivity\nresentfully; Vin had heard several of the apprentices grumble that they’d\nalmost rather have been taken by the Ministry. Yet, during their two days in\nthe cellar, everyone had stayed in the safe house except when absolutely\nnecessary. They understood the danger: Marsh could have given the\nInquisitors descriptions and aliases for each crewmember.\nBreeze shook his head. “Perhaps, gentlemen, it is time to pack up this\noperation. We tried hard, and considering the fact that our original plan—\ngathering the army—ended up so dreadfully, I’d say that we’ve done quite a\nmarvelous job.”\nDockson sighed. “Well, we certainly can’t live off of saved funds for\nmuch longer—especially if Kell keeps giving our money away to the skaa.”\nHe sat beside the table that was the room’s only piece of furniture, his most\nimportant ledgers, notes, and contracts organized into neat piles before him.\nHe had been remarkably efficient at gathering every bit of paper that could\nhave incriminated the crew or given further information about their plan.\nBreeze nodded. “I, for one, am looking forward to a change.

It pays\nfor us to be very discerning in the jobs we take. The rewards are great, but\nso are the risks.”\nHam smiled, resting with his arms behind his head, completely\nunconcerned about the dirt. “It kind of makes you wonder how we ended up\non this particular job, eh? Very high risk, very little reward.”\n“None, actually,” Breeze noted. “We’ll never get that atium now.\nKelsier’s words about altruism and working to help the skaa were all well\nand good, but I was always hoping that we’d still get to take a swipe at that\ntreasury.”\n“True,” Dockson said, looking up from his notes. “But, was it worth it\nanyway?

You’re good men—even you, Breeze. Stop\nscowling at me.”\nVin smiled at the familiar banter. There was a sense of mourning\nregarding Marsh, but these were men who knew how to move on despite\ntheir losses. In that way, they really were like skaa, after all.\n“A house war,” Ham said idly, smiling to himself. “How many noblemen\ndead, do you think?”\n“Hundreds, at least,” Dockson said without looking up. “All killed by\ntheir own greedy noble hands.”\n“I’ll admit that I had my doubts about this entire fiasco,” Breeze said.\n“But the interruption in trade this will cause, not to mention the disorder in\nthe government . . . well, you’re right, Dockson. It was worth it.”\n“Indeed!” Ham said, mimicking Breeze’s stuffy voice.\nI’m going to miss them, Vin thought regretfully. Maybe Kelsier will take\nme with him on his next job.\nThe stairs rattled, and Vin moved reflexively back into the shadows. The\nsplintery door opened, and a familiar, black-clothed form strode in. He\ncarried his mistcloak over his arm, and his face looked incredibly wearied.\n“Kelsier!” Vin said, stepping forward.\n“Hello, all,” he said in a tired voice.\nI know that tiredness, Vin thought. Pewter drag. Where has he been?\n“You’re late, Kell,” Dockson said, still not looking up from his ledgers.\n“I strive for nothing if not consistency,” Kelsier said, dropping his\nmistcloak on the floor, stretching, then sitting down. “Where are Clubs and\nSpook?”"

We figured you’d want him to have our best Tineye to keep a\nwatch.”\n“Good idea,” Kelsier said, letting out a deep sigh and closing his eyes as\nhe leaned against the wall.\n“My dear man,” Breeze said, “you look terrible.”\n“It’s not as bad as it looks—I took it easy coming back, even stopped to\nsleep for a few hours on the way.”\n“Yes, but where were you?” Ham asked pointedly. “We’ve been worried\nsick that you were out doing something . . . well, stupid.”\n“Actually,” Breeze noted, “we took it for granted that you were doing\nsomething stupid. We’ve just been wondering how stupid this particular\nevent would turn out to be. So, what is it? Did you assassinate the lord\nprelan? Slaughter dozens of noblemen? Steal the cloak off the Lord Ruler’s\nown back?”\n“I destroyed the Pits of Hathsin,” Kelsier said quietly.\nThe room fell into a stunned silence.\n“You know,” Breeze finally said, “you’d think that by now we’d have\nlearned not to underestimate him.”\n“Destroyed them?” Ham asked. “How do you destroy the Pits of\nHathsin? They’re just a bunch of cracks in the ground!”\n“Well, I didn’t actually destroy the pits themselves,” Kelsier explained. “I\njust shattered the crystals that produce atium geodes.”\n“All of them?” Dockson asked, dumbstruck.\n“All of them that I could find,” Kelsier said. “And that was several\nhundred pockets’ worth. It was actually a lot easier to get around down\nthere, now that I have Allomancy.”\n“Crystals?” Vin asked, confused.\n“Atium crystals, Vin,” Dockson said. “They produce the geodes—I don’t\nthink anyone actually knows how—that have atium beads at the center.”\nKelsier nodded. “The crystals are why the Lord Ruler can’t just send\ndown Allomancers to Pull out the atium geodes. Using Allomancy near the\ncrystals makes them shatter—and it takes centuries for them to grow back.”\n“Centuries during which they won’t produce atium,” Dockson added.\n“And so you . . .” Vin trailed off.\n“I pretty much ended atium production in the Final Empire for the next\nthree hundred years or so.”\nElend. House Venture. They’re in charge of the Pits. How will the Lord\nRuler react when he finds out about this?\n“You madman,” Breeze said quietly, eyes open wide. “Atium is the\nfoundation of the imperial economy—controlling it is one of the main ways\nthat the Lord Ruler maintains his hold over the nobility. We may not get to\nhis reserves, but this will eventually have the same effect. You blessed\nlunatic . . . you blessed genius!”\nKelsier smiled wryly. “I appreciate both compliments. Have the\nInquisitors moved against Clubs’s shop yet?”\n“Not that our watchmen have seen,” Dockson said."

At the very\nleast, maybe they don’t realize that their Soothing stations were\ncompromised. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to sleep. We have a lot of\nplanning to do tomorrow.”\nThe group paused.\n“Planning?” Dox finally asked. “Kell . . . we were kind of thinking that\nwe should pull out. We caused a house war, and you just took out the\nimperial economy. With our cover—and our plan—compromised . . . Well,\nyou can’t honestly expect us to do anything more, right?”\nKelsier smiled, staggering to his feet and moving into the back room.\n“We’ll talk tomorrow.”\n“What do you think he’s planning, Sazed?” Vin asked, sitting on a stool\nbeside the cellar’s hearth as the Terrisman prepared the afternoon meal.\nKelsier had slept through the night, and had yet to rise this afternoon.\n“I really have no idea, Mistress,” Sazed replied, sipping the stew.\n“Though, this moment—with the city so unbalanced—does seem like the\nperfect opportunity to move against the Final Empire.”\nVin sat thoughtfully. “I suppose we could still seize the palace—that’s\nwhat Kell always wanted to do. But, if the Lord Ruler has been warned, the\nothers don’t see that happening. Plus, it doesn’t seem like we have enough\nsoldiers to do much in the city. Ham and Breeze never finished their\nrecruiting.”\nSazed shrugged.\n“Maybe Kelsier plans to do something about the Lord Ruler,” Vin mused.\n“Perhaps.”\n“Sazed?” Vin said slowly. “You collect legends, right?”\n“As a Keeper I collect many things,” Sazed said. “Stories, legends,\nreligions. When I was young, another Keeper recited all of his knowledge to\nme so that I could store it, and then add to it.”\n“Have you ever heard about this ‘Eleventh Metal’ legend that Kelsier\ntalks about?”\nSazed paused. “No, Mistress. That legend was new to me when I heard of\nit from Master Kelsier.”\n“But he swears that it’s true,” Vin said. “And I . . . believe him, for some\nreason.”\n“It is very possible that there are legends I haven’t heard of,” Sazed said.\n“If the Keepers knew everything, then why would we need to keep\nsearching?”\nVin nodded, still a bit uncertain.\nSazed continued to stir the soup. He seemed so . . . dignified, even while\nperforming such a menial task. He stood in his steward’s robes,\nunconcerned with how simple a service he was performing, easily taking\nover for the servants the crew had dismissed.\nQuick footsteps sounded on the stairs, and Vin perked up, sliding off her\nstool.\n“Mistress?” Sazed asked.\n“Someone on the stairs,” Vin said, moving to the doorway.\nOne of the apprentices—Vin thought his name was Tase—burst into the"

Now that Lestibournes was gone, Tase had become the crew’s\nmain lookout.\n“People are gathering in the square,” Tase said, gesturing toward the\nstairs.\n“What’s this?” Dockson said, entering from the other room.\n“People in the fountain square, Master Dockson,” the boy said. “Word on\nthe street is that the obligators are planning more executions.”\nRetribution for the Pits, Vin thought. That didn’t take long.\nDockson’s expression darkened. “Go wake Kell.”\n“I intend to watch them,” Kelsier said, walking through the room, dressed\nin simple skaa clothing and cloak.\nVin’s stomach twisted. Again?\n“You all may do as you wish,” Kelsier said. He looked much better after\nhis extended rest—his exhaustion was gone, replaced with the characteristic\nstrength Vin had come to expect from him.\n“The executions are probably a reaction to what I did at the Pits,” Kelsier\ncontinued. “I’m going to watch those people’s deaths—because indirectly, I\ncaused them.”\n“It’s not your fault, Kell,” Dockson said.\n“It’s all of our faults,” Kelsier said bluntly. “That doesn’t make what we\ndo wrong—however, if it weren’t for us, these people wouldn’t have to die.\nI, for one, think that the least we can do for these people is bear witness to\ntheir passing.”\nHe pulled open the door, climbing the steps. Slowly, the rest of the crew\nfollowed him—though Clubs, Sazed, and the apprentices remained with the\nsafe house.\nVin climbed the musty-aired steps, eventually joining the others on a\ngrimy street in the middle of a skaa slum. Ash fell from the sky, floating in\nlazily flakes. Kelsier was already walking down the street, and the rest of\nthem—Breeze, Ham, Dockson, and Vin—quickly moved to catch up with\nhim.\nThe safe house wasn’t far from the fountain square. Kelsier, however,\npaused a few streets away from their destination. Dull-eyed skaa continued\nwalking around them, jostling the crew. Bells rang in the distance.\n“Kell?” Dockson asked.\nKelsier cocked his head. “Vin, you hear that?”\nShe closed her eyes, then flared her tin. Focus, she thought. Like Spook\nsaid. Cut through the shuffling feet and murmuring voices. Hear over the\ndoors shutting and the people breathing. Listen. . . .\n“Horses,” she said, dampening her tin and opening her eyes. “And\ncarriages.”\n“Carts,” Kelsier said, turning toward the side of the street. “The prisoner\ncarts. They’re coming this way.”\nHe looked up at the buildings around him, then grabbed hold of a\nraingutter and began to shimmy up a wall. Breeze rolled his eyes, nudging\nDockson and nodding toward the front of the building, but Vin and Ham—\nwith pewter—easily followed Kelsier up to the roof."

Vin could just\nbarely make out a row of barred prison carts rolling toward the square.\nDockson and Breeze entered the slanted rooftop through a window.\nKelsier remained where he was, standing by the roof’s lip, staring out at the\nprison carts.\n“Kell,” Ham said warily. “What are you thinking?”\n“We’re still a short distance from the square,” he said slowly. “And the\nInquisitors aren’t riding with the prisoners—they’ll come down from the\npalace, like last time. There can’t be more than a hundred soldiers guarding\nthose people.”\n“A hundred men are plenty, Kell,” Ham said.\nKelsier didn’t seem to hear the words. He took another step forward,\napproaching up onto the roof’s edge. “I can stop this. . . . I can save them.”\nVin stepped up beside him. “Kell, there might not be many guards with\nthe prisoners, but the fountain square is only a few blocks away. It’s packed\nwith soldiers, not to mention the Inquisitors!”\nHam, unexpectedly, didn’t back her up. He turned, glancing at Dockson\nand Breeze. Dox paused, then shrugged.\n“Are you all crazy?” Vin demanded.\n“Wait a moment,” Breeze said, squinting. “I’m no Tineye, but don’t some\nof those prisoners look a bit too well dressed?”\nKelsier froze, then he cursed. Without warning, he jumped off the\nrooftop, dropping to the street below.\n“Kell!” Vin said. “What—” Then she paused, looking up in the red\nsunlight, watching the slowly approaching procession of carts. Through tin-\nenhanced eyes, she thought that she recognized someone sitting near the\nfront of one of the carts.\nSpook.\n“Kelsier, what’s going on!” Vin demanded, dashing down the street behind\nhim.\nHe slowed just a bit. “I saw Renoux and Spook in that first cart. The\nMinistry must have hit Renoux’s canal procession—the people in those\ncages are the servants, staff, and guards we hired to work at the mansion.”\nThe canal procession . . . Vin thought. The Ministry must know that\nRenoux was a fake. Marsh broke after all.\nBehind them, Ham appeared out of the building and onto the street.\nBreeze and Dockson were slower in coming.\n“We have to work quickly!” Kelsier said, picking up his pace again.\n“Kell!” Vin said, grabbing his arm. “Kelsier, you can’t save them.\nThey’re too well guarded, and it’s daylight in the middle of the city. You’ll\njust get yourself killed!”\nHe paused, halting in the street, turning in Vin’s grasp. He looked into her\neyes, disappointed. “You don’t understand what this is all about, do you,\nVin? You never did. I let you stop me once before, on the hillside by the\nbattlefield. Not this time. This time I can do something.”\n“But . . .”\nHe shook his arm free. “You still have some things to learn about"

We’re not\ninvincible.”\nDockson snorted. “We’re not helpless either.”\nBreeze puffed up behind them, pointing toward a side street. “There.

The vials\nsparkled in the air beside him, falling to shatter against the cobblestones. He\nducked through one final alleyway, bursting out onto an eerily empty\nthoroughfare.\nThe prisoner carts rolled toward him, entering a small courtyard square\nformed by the intersection of two streets. Each rectangular vehicle was\nlined with bars; each one was packed with people who were now distinctly\nfamiliar. Servants, soldiers, housekeepers—some were rebels, many were\njust regular people. None of them deserved death.\nToo many skaa have died already, he thought, flaring his metals.\nHundreds. Thousands. Hundreds of thousands.\nNot today. No more.\nHe dropped a coin and jumped, Pushing himself through the air in a wide\narc. Soldiers looked up, pointing. Kelsier landed directly in their center.\nThere was a quiet moment as the soldiers turned in surprise. Kelsier\ncrouched amid them, bits of ash falling from the sky.\nThen he Pushed.\nHe flared steel with a yell, standing and Pushing outward. The burst of\nAllomantic power hurled soldiers away by their breastplates, tossing a\ndozen men into the air, sending them crashing into companions and walls.\nMen screamed. Kelsier spun, Pushing against a group of soldiers and\nsending himself flying toward a prison cart. He smashed into it, flaring his\nsteel and grabbing the metal door with his hands.\nPrisoners huddled back in surprise. Kelsier ripped the door free with a\nburst of pewter-enhanced power, then tossed it toward a group of\napproaching soldiers.\n“Go!” he told the prisoners, jumping down and landing lightly in the\nstreet. He spun.\nAnd came face-to-face with a tall figure wearing a brown robe. Kelsier\npaused, stepping back as the tall form reached up, lowering his hood,\nrevealing a pair of eyes impaled by spikes.\nThe Inquisitor smiled, and Kelsier heard footsteps approaching down\nside alleyways. Dozens. Hundreds.\n“Damnation!” Breeze swore as soldiers flooded the square. Dockson pulled\nBreeze into an alley.

Kelsier, get out of there!\nKelsier Pushed off a fallen guard, throwing himself backward in a flip over\none of the prison carts. He landed in a crouch, eyeing the new squads of\nsoldiers. Many of them carried staves and wore no armor. Hazekillers.\nThe Inquisitor Pushed himself through the ash-filled air, landing with a\nthump in front of Kelsier. The creature smiled.\nIt’s the same man. The Inquisitor from before.\n“Where’s the girl?” the creature said quietly.\nKelsier ignored the question. “Why only one of you?” he demanded.\nThe creature’s smile deepened. “I won the draw.”\nKelsier flared pewter, dashing to the side as the Inquisitor pulled out a\npair of obsidian axes. The square was quickly becoming clogged with\nsoldiers. From inside the carts he could hear people crying out.\n“Kelsier! Lord Kelsier! Please!”\nKelsier cursed quietly as the Inquisitor bore down on him. He reached\nout, Pulling against one of the still full carts and yanking himself into the air\nover a group of soldiers. He landed, then dashed to the cart, intending to\nfree its occupants. As he arrived, however, the cart shook. Kelsier glanced\nup just in time to see a steel-eyed monster grinning down at him from atop\nthe vehicle.\nKelsier Pushed himself backward, feeling the wind of an axehead swing\nbeside his head. He landed smoothly, but immediately had to jump to the\nside as a group of soldiers attacked. As he landed, he reached out—Pulling\nagainst one of the carts to anchor himself—and Pulled against the fallen\niron door he had thrown before. The barred door lurched into the air and\ncrashed through the squad of soldiers.\nThe Inquisitor attacked from behind, but Kelsier jumped away. The still\ntumbling door careened across the cobblestones in front of him, and as he\npassed over it, Kelsier Pushed, sending himself streaking into the air.\nVin was right, Kelsier thought with frustration. Below, the Inquisitor\nwatched him, trailing him with unnatural eyes. I shouldn’t have done this.\nBelow, a group of soldiers rounded up the skaa that he had freed.\nI should run—try to lose the Inquisitor. I’ve done it before.\nBut . . . he couldn’t. He wouldn’t, not this time. He had compromised too\nmany times before. Even if it cost him everything else, he had to free those\nprisoners.\nAnd then, as he began to fall, he saw a group of men charging the\ncrossroads. They bore weapons, but no uniforms. At their head ran a\nfamiliar form.\nHam! So that’s where you went.\n“What is it?” Vin asked anxiously, craning to see into the square. Above,\nKelsier’s form plunged back toward the fight, dark cloak trailing behind\nhim."

There are other ways to fight, she realized, kneeling beside\nBreeze. “How can I help?”\nKelsier ducked back from the Inquisitor again as Ham’s unit crashed into\nthe imperial soldiers and began cutting its way toward the prisoner carts.\nThe attack diverted the attention of the regular soldiers, who appeared all\ntoo happy to leave Kelsier and the Inquisitor to their solitary battle.\nTo the side, Kelsier could see skaa beginning to clog the streets around\nthe small courtyard, the fighting drawing the attention of those waiting up\nabove at the fountain square. Kelsier could see other squads of imperial\nsoldiers trying to push their way toward the fight, but the thousands of skaa\ncrowding the streets seriously slowed their progress.\nThe Inquisitor swung, and Kelsier dodged. The creature was obviously\ngrowing frustrated. To the side, a small group of Ham’s men reached one of\nthe prisoner carts and broke open its lock, freeing the prisoners. The rest of\nHam’s men kept the imperial soldiers busy as the prisoners fled.\nKelsier smiled, eyeing the annoyed Inquisitor. The creature growled\nquietly.\n“Valette!” a voice screamed.\nKelsier turned in shock. A well-dressed nobleman was pushing his way\nthrough the soldiers toward the center of the fighting. He carried a dueling\ncane and was protected by two beleaguered bodyguards, but he mostly\navoided harm by virtue of neither side being certain of wanting to strike\ndown a man of obvious noble blood.\n“Valette!” Elend Venture yelled again. He turned to one of the soldiers.\n“Who told you to raid House Renoux’s convoy! Who authorized this!”\nGreat, Kelsier thought, keeping a wary eye on the Inquisitor. The\ncreature regarded Kelsier with a twisted, hateful expression.\nYou just go right on hating me, Kelsier thought. I only have to hang on\nlong enough for Ham to free the prisoners.

Below, Ham’s main squad had\nfinally reached the last prison cart. Unfortunately, several more groups of\nimperial soldiers had pushed their way through the gawking skaa crowds.\nOne of them was a large team of archers—armed with obsidian-tipped\narrows.\nKelsier cursed, letting himself fall. The archers set up, obviously\npreparing to fire straight into the fighting crowd. They would kill some of\ntheir own soldiers, but the brunt of their attack would be borne by the\nfleeing prisoners.\nKelsier dropped to the cobblestones. He reached to the side, Pulling\nagainst some discarded bars from the cage he had destroyed. They flew\ntoward him.\nThe archers drew. But he could see their atium-shadows.\nKelsier released the bars and Pushed himself to the side just slightly,\nallowing the bars to fly between the archers and the fleeing prisoners.\nThe archers fired.\nKelsier grabbed the bars, flaring both steel and iron, Pushing against one\ntip of each bar and Pulling against the opposite tip. The bars lurched in the\nair, immediately beginning to spin like furious, lunatic windmills. Most of\nthe flying arrows were sprayed to the side by the spinning rods of iron.\nThe bars clanged to the ground amid the scattered, discarded arrows. The\narchers stood, stupefied, as Kelsier jumped to the side again, then Pulled\nlightly on the bars, flipping them up into the air in front of him. He Pushed,\nsending the bars crashing toward the archers. He turned away as men\nscreamed and died, his eyes seeking his true foe.\nWhere is that creature hiding?\nHe looked into a scene of chaos. Men fought, ran, fled, and died—each\none bearing a prophetic atium-shadow to Kelsier’s eyes. In this case,\nhowever, the shadows effectively doubled the number of people moving on\nthe battlefield, and only served to increase the sense of confusion.\nMore and more soldiers were arriving. Many of Ham’s men were down,\nmost of the rest were retreating—fortunately, they could simply discard\ntheir armor and blend into the skaa crowds. Kelsier was more worried about\nthat last prisoner cart—the one with Renoux and Spook in it. The trajectory\nat which Ham’s group had entered the battle had required them to move up\nthe line of carts, back to front. Trying to get to Renoux first would have\nrequired passing by the five other carts, leaving their people still trapped.\nHam obviously didn’t intend to leave until Spook and Renoux were free.\nAnd, where Ham fought, the rebel soldiers held.

        "text": "no clever Ironpulls or Steelpushes. Ham simply attacked with raw strength\nand speed, throwing enemy soldiers out of his way, laying waste to their\nranks, leading his squad of fifty men toward the final prison cart. As they\nreached it, Ham stepped back to fight off a group of enemy soldiers as one\nof his men broke the cart’s lock.\nKelsier smiled with pride, eyes still searching for the Inquisitor. His men\nwere few, but the enemy soldiers seemed visibly unsettled by the skaa\nrebels’ determination. Kelsier’s men fought with passion—despite their\nother, numerous hindrances, they still had this one advantage.\nThis is what happens when you finally convince them to fight. This is\nwhat hides within them all. It’s just so hard to release. . . .\nRenoux exited the cart, then stepped to the side, watching as his servants\nrushed free from their cage. Suddenly, a well-dressed figure burst from the\nmelee, grabbing Renoux by the front of his suit.\n“Where’s Valette?” Elend Venture demanded, his desperate voice\ncarrying to Kelsier’s tin-enhanced ears. “Which cage was she in?”\nKid, you’re really starting to annoy me, Kelsier thought, Pushing himself\na path through the soldiers as he ran toward the cart.\nThe Inquisitor appeared, leaping out from behind a pile of soldiers. It\nlanded on top of the cage, shaking the entire structure, an obsidian axe\ngrasped in each clawlike hand. The creature met Kelsier’s eyes and smiled,\nthen dropped from the top of the cage and buried an axe in Renoux’s back.\nThe kandra jerked, eyes opening wide. The Inquisitor turned toward\nElend next. Kelsier wasn’t certain if the creature recognized the boy.\nPerhaps the Inquisitor thought Elend to be a member of Renoux’s family.\nPerhaps it didn’t care.\nKelsier paused for just a moment.\nThe Inquisitor raised his axe to strike.\nShe loves him.\nKelsier flared steel within, stoking it, raging it until his chest burned like\nthe Ashmounts themselves. He blasted against the soldiers behind him—\nthrowing dozens of them backward—and streaked toward the Inquisitor. He\ncrashed into the creature as it began to swing.\nThe discarded axe clicked against the stones a few feet away. Kelsier\ngripped the Inquisitor by its neck as the two hit the ground; then he began to\nsqueeze with pewter-enhanced muscles. The Inquisitor reached up,\ngrabbing Kelsier’s hands, desperately trying to force them apart.\nMarsh was right, Kelsier thought through the chaos. It fears for its life. It\ncan be killed.\nThe Inquisitor gasped raggedly, the metal spikeheads protruding from its\neyes just inches from Kelsier’s face. To his side Kelsier saw Elend Venture\nstumble back.\n“The girl is fine!” Kelsier said through gritted teeth. “She wasn’t on the\nRenoux barges. Go!”\nElend paused uncertainly; then one of his bodyguards finally appeared.\nThe boy let himself get dragged away.\nCan’t believe I just saved a nobleman, Kelsier thought, struggling to"

You’d better appreciate this, girl.\nSlowly, with straining muscles, the Inquisitor forced Kelsier’s hands\napart. The creature began to smile again.\nThey’re so strong!\nThe Inquisitor pushed Kelsier back, then Pulled against a soldier, yanking\nitself in a skidding motion across the cobblestones. The Inquisitor hit a\ncorpse and flipped backward, up to its feet. Its neck was red from Kelsier’s\ngrip, bits of flesh torn by his fingernails, but it smiled still.\nKelsier Pushed against a soldier, flipping himself up as well. To his side,\nhe saw Renoux leaning against the cart. Kelsier caught the kandra’s eyes\nand nodded slightly.\nRenoux dropped to the ground with a sigh, axe in his back.\n“Kelsier!” Ham yelled over the crowd.\n“Go!” Kelsier told him. “Renoux is dead.”\nHam glanced at Renoux’s body, then nodded. He turned to his men,\ncalling orders.\n“Survivor,” a rasping voice said.\nKelsier spun. The Inquisitor strode forward, stepping with pewter’s lithe\npower, surrounded by a haze of atium-shadows.\n“Survivor of Hathsin,” it said. “You promised me a fight. Must I kill\nmore skaa?”\nKelsier flared his metals. “I never said we were done.” Then, he smiled.\nHe was worried, he was pained, but he was also exhilarated. All of his life,\nthere had been a piece of him that had wished to stand and fight.\nHe’d always wanted to see if he could take an Inquisitor.\nVin stood, trying desperately to see over the crowd.\n“What?” Dockson asked.\n“I thought I saw Elend!”\n“Here? That sounds a bit ridiculous, don’t you think?”\nVin flushed. Probably. “Regardless, I’m going to try and get a better\nview.” She grabbed the side of the alleyway.\n“Be careful,” Dox said. “If that Inquisitor sees you . . .”\nVin nodded, scrambling up the bricks. Once she got high enough, she\nscanned the intersection for familiar figures. Dockson was right: Elend was\nnowhere to be seen. One of the carts—the one off of which the Inquisitor\nhad ripped the cage—lay on its side. Horses stomped about, hedged in by\nthe fighting and the skaa crowds.\n“What do you see?” Dox called up.\n“Renoux is down!” Vin said, squinting and burning tin. “Looks like an\naxe in his back.”\n“That may or may not be fatal for him,” Dockson said cryptically. “I\ndon’t know a lot about kandra.”\nKandra?\n“What about the prisoners?” Dox called.\n“They’re all free,” Vin said. “The cages are empty.

The area was in a small\ndepression, and Vin could see thousands of skaa packing the streets sloping\nupward in all directions.\n“Ham’s free!” Vin said. “I don’t see him—alive or dead—anywhere!\nSpook’s gone too.”\n“And Kell?” Dockson asked urgently.\nVin paused. “He’s still fighting the Inquisitor.”\nKelsier flared his pewter, punching the Inquisitor, careful to avoid the flat\ndisks of metal sticking out the front of its eyes. The creature stumbled, and\nKelsier buried his fist in its stomach. The Inquisitor growled and slapped\nKelsier across the face, throwing him down with one blow.\nKelsier shook his head. What does it take to kill this thing? he thought,\nPushing himself up to his feet, backing away.\nThe Inquisitor strode forward. Some of the soldiers were trying to search\nthe crowd for Ham and his men, but many just stood still. A fight between\ntwo powerful Allomancers was something whispered about, but never seen.\nSoldier and peasant stood dumbfounded, watching the battle with awe.\nHe’s stronger than I am, Kelsier acknowledged, watching the Inquisitor\nwarily. But strength isn’t everything.\nKelsier reached out, grabbing smaller metal sources and Pulling them\naway from their owners—metal caps, fine steel swords, coin pouches,\ndaggers. He threw them at the Inquisitor—carefully manipulating\nSteelpushes and Ironpulls—and kept his atium burning so that each item he\ncontrolled would have a fanning multitude of atium-images in the\nInquisitor’s eyes.\nThe Inquisitor cursed quietly as it deflected the swarming bits of metal.\nKelsier, however, just used the Inquisitor’s own Pushes against it, Pulling\neach item back, whipping them around at the creature. The Inquisitor\nblasted outward, Pushing against all the items at once, and Kelsier let them\ngo. As soon as the Inquisitor stopped Pushing, however, Kelsier Pulled his\nweapons back.\nThe imperial soldiers formed a ring, watching warily. Kelsier used them,\nPushing against breastplates, lurching himself back and forth in the air. The\nquick changes in position let him move constantly, disorienting the\nInquisitor, allowing him to Push his different flying pieces of metal where\nhe wanted them.\n“Keep an eye on my belt buckle,” Dockson asked, wobbling slightly as he\nclung to the bricks beside Vin. “If I fall off, give me a Pull to slow the fall,\neh?”\nVin nodded, but she wasn’t paying much attention to Dox. She was\nwatching Kelsier. “He’s incredible!”\nKelsier lurched back and forth in the air, his feet never touching the\nground. Bits of metal buzzed around him, responding to his Pushes and\nPulls. He controlled them with such skill, one would have thought they\nwere living things. The Inquisitor slapped them away with a fury, but was\nobviously having trouble keeping track of them all.\nI underestimated Kelsier, Vin thought. I assumed that he was less skilled"

I assumed that he was less skilled\nthan the Mistings because he’d spread himself too thin. But that wasn’t it at\nall. This. This is his specialty—Pushing and Pulling with expert control.\nAnd iron and steel are the metals he personally trained me in. Maybe he\nunderstood all along.\nKelsier spun and flew amid a maelstrom of metal. Every time something hit\nthe ground, he flicked it back up. The items always flew in straight lines,\nbut he kept moving, Pushing himself around, keeping them in the air,\nperiodically shooting them at the Inquisitor.\nThe creature spun, confused. It tried to Push itself upward, but Kelsier\nshot several larger pieces of metal over the creature’s head, and it had to\nPush against them, throwing off its jump.\nAn iron bar hit the Inquisitor in the face.\nThe creature stumbled, blood marring the tattoos on the side of its face. A\nsteel helmet struck it in the side, tossing it backward.\nKelsier began to shoot pieces of metal quickly, feeling his rage and anger\nmount. “Were you the one who killed Marsh?” he yelled, not bothering to\nlisten for an answer. “Were you there when I was condemned, years ago?”\nThe Inquisitor raised a warding hand, Pushing away the next swarm of\nmetals. It limped backward, putting its back against the overturned wooden\ncart.\nKelsier heard the creature growl, and a sudden Push of strength washed\nthrough the crowd, toppling soldiers, causing Kelsier’s metal weapons to\nshoot away.\nKelsier let them go. He dashed forward, rushing the disoriented\nInquisitor, scooping up a loose cobblestone.\nThe creature turned toward him, and Kelsier yelled, swinging the\ncobblestone, his strength fueled almost more by rage than by pewter.\nHe hit the Inquisitor square in the eyes. The creature’s head snapped\nback, smacking against the bottom of the overturned cart. Kelsier struck\nagain, yelling, repeatedly smashing his cobblestone into the creature’s face.\nThe Inquisitor howled in pain, reaching clawlike hands for Kelsier,\nmoving as if to jump forward. Then it suddenly jerked to a stop, its head\nstuck against the cart’s wood. The spike tips that jutted from the back of its\nskull had been pounded into the wood by Kelsier’s attack.\nKelsier smiled as the creature screamed in rage, struggling to pull its\nhead free from the wood. Kelsier turned to the side, seeking an item he had\nseen on the ground a few moments before. He kicked over a corpse,\nsnatching the obsidian axe off the ground, its rough-chipped blade glittering\nin the red sunlight.\n“I’m glad you talked me into this,” he said quietly. Then he swung with a\ntwo-handed blow, slamming the axehead through the Inquisitor’s neck and\ninto the wood behind.\nThe Inquisitor’s body slumped to the cobblestones. The head remained\nwhere it was, staring out with its eerie, tattooed, unnatural gaze—pinned to\nthe wood by its own spikes."

The head remained\nwhere it was, staring out with its eerie, tattooed, unnatural gaze—pinned to\nthe wood by its own spikes.\nKelsier turned to face the crowd, suddenly feeling incredibly wearied.\nHis body ached from dozens of bruises and cuts, and he didn’t even know\nwhen his cloak had ripped free. He faced the soldiers defiantly, however, his\nscarred arms plainly visible.\n“The Survivor of Hathsin!” one whispered.\n“He killed an Inquisitor. . . .” said another.\nAnd then the chanting began. The skaa in the surrounding streets began\nto scream his name. The soldiers looked around, realizing with horror that\nthey were surrounded. The peasants began to press in, and Kelsier could\nfeel their anger and hope.\nMaybe this doesn’t have to go the way I assumed, Kelsier thought\ntriumphantly. Maybe I don’t have—\nThen it hit. Like a cloud moving before the sun, like a sudden storm on a\nquiet night, like a pair of fingers snuffing a candle. An oppressive hand\nstifled the budding skaa emotions. The people cringed, and their cries died\nout. The fire Kelsier had built within them was too new.\nSo close . . . he thought.\nUp ahead, a single, black carriage crested the hill and began to move\ndown from the fountain square.\nThe Lord Ruler had arrived.\nVin nearly lost her grip as the wave of depression hit her. She flared her\ncopper, but—as always—she could still slightly feel the Lord Ruler’s\noppressive hand.\n“Lord Ruler!” Dockson said, though Vin couldn’t tell if it was a curse or\nan observation. Skaa that had been packed in to view the fight somehow\nmanaged to make room for the dark carriage. It rolled down a corridor of\npeople toward the corpse-littered square.\nSoldiers pulled back, and Kelsier stepped away from the fallen cart,\nmoving out to face the oncoming carriage.\n“What is he doing?” Vin asked, turning toward Dockson, who had\npropped himself up on a small outcropping. “Why doesn’t he run? This is\nno Inquisitor—this isn’t something to fight!”\n“This is it, Vin,” Dockson said, awed. “This is what he’s been waiting for.\nA chance to face the Lord Ruler—a chance to prove those legends of his.”\nVin turned back toward the square. The carriage rolled to a stop.\n“But . . .” she said quietly. “The Eleventh Metal. Did he bring it?”\n“He must have.”\nKelsier always said that the Lord Ruler was his task, Vin thought. He let\nthe rest of us work on the nobility, the Garrison, and the Ministry. But this .\n. . Kelsier always planned to do this himself.\nThe Lord Ruler stepped from his carriage, and Vin leaned forward,\nburning tin. He looked like . . .\nA man.\nHe was dressed in a black and white uniform somewhat like a\nnobleman’s suit, but far more exaggerated. The coat reached all the way to\nhis feet, and trailed behind him as he walked. His vest wasn’t colored, but a\npure black, though it was accented with brilliant white markings. As Vin"

As Vin\nhad heard, his fingers glittered with rings, the symbol of his power.\nI’m so much stronger than you, the rings proclaimed, that it doesn’t\nmatter if I wear metal.\nHandsome, with jet black hair and pale skin, the Lord Ruler was tall,\nthin, and confident. And he was young—younger than Vin would have\nexpected, even younger than Kelsier. He strode across the square, avoiding\ncorpses, his soldiers pulling back and forcing the skaa away.\nSuddenly, a small group of figures burst through the line of soldiers. They\nwore the mismatched armor of rebels, and the man leading them looked just\na bit familiar. He was one of Ham’s Thugs.\n“For my wife!” the Thug said, holding up a spear and charging.\n“For Lord Kelsier!” yelled the other four.\nOh no . . . Vin thought.\nThe Lord Ruler, however, ignored the men. The lead rebel bellowed in\ndefiance, then rammed his spear through the Lord Ruler’s chest.\nThe Lord Ruler just continued to walk, passing the soldier, spear sticking\nall the way through his body.\nThe rebel paused, then grabbed a spear from one of his friends and drove\nthis one through the Lord Ruler’s back. Again, the Lord Ruler ignored the\nmen—as if they, and their weapons, were completely beneath his contempt.\nThe lead rebel stumbled back, then spun as his friends began to scream\nunder an Inquisitor’s axe. He joined them shortly, and the Inquisitor stood\nabove the corpses for a moment, hacking gleefully.\nThe Lord Ruler continued forward, two spears sticking—as if unnoticed\n—from his body. Kelsier stood waiting. He looked ragged in his ripped skaa\nclothing. Yet, he was proud. He didn’t bend or bow beneath the weight of\nthe Lord Ruler’s Soothing.\nThe Lord Ruler stopped a few feet away, one of the spears nearly\ntouching Kelsier’s chest. Black ash fell lightly around the two men, bits of\nit curling and blowing in the faint wind. The square fell horribly silent—\neven the Inquisitor stopped his gruesome work. Vin leaned forward,\nclinging precariously to the rough brickwork.\nDo something, Kelsier! Use the metal!\nThe Lord Ruler glanced at the Inquisitor that Kelsier had killed. “Those\nare very hard to replace.” His accented voice carried easily to Vin’s tin-\nenhanced ears.\nEven from a distance, she could see Kelsier smile.\n“I killed you, once,” the Lord Ruler said, turning back to Kelsier.\n“You tried,” Kelsier replied, his voice loud and firm, carrying across the\nsquare. “But you can’t kill me, Lord Tyrant. I represent that thing you’ve\nnever been able to kill, no matter how hard you try. I am hope.”\nThe Lord Ruler snorted in disdain. He raised a casual arm, then\nbackhanded Kelsier with a blow so powerful that Vin could hear the crack\nresound through the square.\nKelsier lurched and spun, spraying blood as he fell.\n“NO!” Vin screamed."

Prompted by the Inquisitor, the soldiers turned and\nattacked the crowd. Other Inquisitors appeared from the square above,\nriding black horses, ebony axes glistening in the afternoon light.\nVin ignored it all. “Kelsier!” she screamed. His body lay where it had\nfallen, spear jutting from his chest, scarlet blood pooling around him.\nNo. No. NO! She jumped from the building, Pushing against some people\nand throwing herself over the massacre. She landed in the center of the\noddly empty square—Lord Ruler gone, Inquisitors busy killing skaa. She\nscrambled to Kelsier’s side.\nThere was almost nothing remaining of the left side of his face. The right\nside, however . . . it still smiled faintly, single dead eye staring up into the\nred-black sky. Bits of ash fell lightly on his face.\n“Kelsier, no . . .” Vin said, tears streaming down her face. She prodded\nhis body, feeling for a pulse.

He was invincible.\nHe should have been.\nSomeone grabbed her and she squirmed, crying out.\n“Time to go, kid,” Ham said. He paused, looking at Kelsier, assuring for\nhimself that the crewleader was dead.\nThen he towed her away. Vin continued to struggle weakly, but she was\ngrowing numb. In the back of her mind, she heard Reen’s voice.\nSee. I told you he would leave you. I warned you.

They were\nslightly wet, cool upon her skin. Like the tears of a dead man.\nWhy does it matter, anymore? she thought, staring upward. Why does\nanything matter? What was it you said to me, Kelsier? That I never really\nunderstood? That I still needed to learn about friendship? What about you?\nYou didn’t even fight him.\nHe stood there again, in her mind. The Lord Ruler struck him down with\na disdainful blow. The Survivor had died like any other man.\nIs this why you were so hesitant to promise that you wouldn’t abandon\nme?\nShe wished she could just . . . go. Float away. Become mist. She’d once\nwished for freedom—and then had assumed she’d found it. She’d been\nwrong. This wasn’t freedom, this grief, this hole within her.\nIt was the same as before, when Reen had abandoned her. What was the\ndifference? At least Reen had been honest. He’d always promised that he\nwould leave. Kelsier had led her along, telling her to trust and to love, but\nReen had always been the truthful one.\n“I don’t want to do this anymore,” she whispered to the mists. “Can’t you\njust take me?”\nThe mists gave no answer. They continued to spin playfully, uncaring.\nAlways changing—yet somehow, always the same.\n“Mistress?” called an uncertain voice from below. “Mistress, is that you\nup there?”\nVin sighed, burning tin, then extinguishing steel and letting herself drop.\nHer mistcloak fluttered as she fell through the mists; she landed quietly on\nthe rooftop above their safe house. Sazed stood a short distance away,\nbeside the steel ladder that the lookouts had been using to get atop the\nbuilding.\n“Yes, Saze?” she asked tiredly, reaching out to Pull up the three coins\nshe’d been using as anchors to stabilize her like the legs of a tripod. One of\nthem was twisted and bent—the same coin she and Kelsier had gotten into a\nPushing match over so many months ago.\n“I’m sorry, Mistress,” Sazed said. “I simply wondered where you had\ngone.”\nShe shrugged.\n“It is a strangely quiet night, I think,” Sazed said.\n“A mournful night.” Hundreds of skaa had been massacred following\nKelsier’s death, and hundreds more had been trampled during the rush to\nescape.\n“I wonder if his death even meant anything,” she said quietly. “We\nprobably saved a lot fewer than were killed.”\n“Slain by evil men, Mistress.”\n“Ham often asks if there even is such a thing as ‘evil.’ ”\n“Master Hammond likes to ask questions,” Sazed said, “but even he\ndoesn’t question the answers. There are evil men . . . just as there are good\nmen.”"

They stood there for a moment, watching the\nnight. “What of the others?” she finally asked.\n“They are discussing what to do next,” Sazed said. “I believe it has been\ndecided that they will leave Luthadel separately and seek refuge in other\ntowns.”\n“And . . . you?”\n“I must travel north—to my homeland, to the place of the Keepers—so\nthat I can share the knowledge that I possess. I must tell my brethren and\nsisters of the logbook—especially the words regarding our ancestor, the\nman named Rashek. There is much to learn in this story, I think.”\nHe paused, then glanced at her. “This is not a journey I can take with\nanother, Mistress. The places of the Keepers must remain secret, even from\nyou.”\nOf course, Vin thought. Of course he’d go too.\n“I will return,” he promised.\nSure you will. Just like all of the others have.\nThe crew had made her feel needed for a time, but she’d always known it\nwould end. It was time to go back to the streets. Time to be alone again."

Time to be alone again.\n“Mistress . . .” Sazed said slowly. “Do you hear that?”\nShe shrugged. But . . . there was something. Voices. Vin frowned,\nwalking to the other side of the building. They grew louder, becoming\neasily distinct even without tin. She peered over the side of the rooftop.\nA group of skaa men, perhaps ten in number, stood in the street below. A\nthieving crew? Vin wondered as Sazed joined her. The group’s numbers\nwere swelling as more skaa timidly left their dwellings.\n“Come,” said a skaa man who stood at the front of the group. “Fear not\nthe mist! Didn’t the Survivor name himself Lord of the Mists? Did he not\nsay that we have nothing to fear from them? Indeed, they will protect us,\ngive us safety. Give us power, even!”\nAs more and more skaa left their homes without obvious repercussion,\nthe group began to swell even further.\n“Go get the others,” Vin said.\n“Good idea,” Sazed said, moving quickly to the ladder.\n“Your friends, your children, your fathers, your mothers, wives, and\nlovers,” the skaa man said, lighting a lantern and holding it up. “They lie\ndead in the street not a half hour from here. The Lord Ruler doesn’t even\nhave the decency to clean up his slaughter!”\nThe crowd began to mutter in agreement.\n“Even when the cleaning occurs,” the man said, “will it be the Lord\nRuler’s hands that dig the graves? No! It will be our hands. Lord Kelsier\nspoke of this.”\n“Lord Kelsier!” several men agreed. The group was getting large now,\nbeing joined by women and youths.\nClanking on the ladder announced Ham’s arrival. He was joined shortly\nby Sazed, then Breeze, Dockson, Spook, and even Clubs.\n“Lord Kelsier!” proclaimed the man below. Others lit torches,\nbrightening the mists. “Lord Kelsier fought for us today! He slew an\nimmortal Inquisitor!”\nThe crowd grumbled in assent.\n“But then he died!” someone yelled.\nSilence.\n“And what did we do to help him?” the leader asked. “Many of us were\nthere—thousands of us. Did we help? No! We waited and watched, even as\nhe fought for us. We stood dumbly and let him fall. We watched him die!\n“Or did we? What did the Survivor say—that the Lord Ruler could never\nreally kill him? Kelsier is the Lord of the Mists! Is he not with us now?”\nVin turned to the others. Ham was watching carefully, but Breeze just\nshrugged. “The man’s obviously insane. A religious nut.”\n“I tell you, friends!” screamed the man below. The crowd was still\ngrowing, more and more torches being lit. “I tell you the truth! Lord Kelsier\nappeared to me this very night! He said that he would always be with us.\nWill we let him down again?”\n“No!” came the reply."

Another one appeared to the east, near a skaa\nslum. A third appeared. Then a fourth. In a matter of moments, it seemed\nlike the entire city was glowing.\n“You insane genius . . .” Dockson whispered.\n“What?” Clubs asked, frowning.\n“We missed it,” Dox said. “The atium, the army, the nobility . . . that\nwasn’t the job Kelsier was planning. This was his job! Our crew was never\nsupposed to topple the Final Empire—we were too small. An entire city’s\npopulation, however . . .”\n“You’re saying he did this on purpose?” Breeze asked.\n“He always asked me the same question,” Sazed said from behind. “He\nalways asked what gave religions so much power. Each time, I answered\nhim the same. . . .” Sazed looked at them, cocking his head. “I told him that\nit was because their believers had something they felt passionate about.\nSomething . . . or someone.”\n“But, why not tell us?” Breeze asked.\n“Because he knew,” Dox said quietly. “He knew something we would\nnever agree to. He knew that he would have to die.”\nBreeze shook his head. “I don’t buy it. Why even bother with us, then?\nHe could have done this on his own.”\nWhy even bother . . . “Dox,” Vin said, turning. “Where’s that warehouse\nKelsier rented, the one where he held his informant meetings?”\nDockson paused. “Not far away, actually. Two streets down. He said he\nwanted it to be near the bolt-lair. . . .”\n“Show me!” Vin said, scrambling over the side of the building. The\ngathered skaa continued to yell, each cry louder than the one before. The\nentire street blazed with light, flickering torches turning the mist into a\nbrilliant haze.\nDockson led her down the street, the rest of the crew trailing behind. The\nwarehouse was a large, run-down structure squatting disconsolately in the\nslum’s industrial section. Vin walked up to it, then flared pewter and\nsmashed off the lock.\nThe door slowly swung open. Dockson held up a lantern, and its light\nrevealed sparkling piles of metal. Weapons. Swords, axes, staves, and\nhelmets glittered in the light—an incredible silvery hoard.\nThe crew stared at the room in wonder.\n“This is the reason,” Vin said quietly. “He needed the Renoux front to\nbuy weapons in such numbers. He knew his rebellion would need these if\nthey were going to succeed in taking the city.”\n“Why gather an army, then?” Ham said. “Was it just a front too?”\n“I guess,” Vin said.\n“Wrong,” a voice said, echoing through the cavernous warehouse. “There\nwas so much more to it than that.”"

That part of his plan was .\n. . hampered by events. That was only one bit of why he needed you,\nhowever. The noble houses needed to fall to leave a void in the political\nstructure. The Garrison needed to leave the town so that the skaa wouldn’t\nbe slaughtered.”\n“He planned this all from the start,” Ham said with wonder. “Kelsier\nknew that the skaa wouldn’t rise up. They’d been beaten down for so long,\ntrained to think that the Lord Ruler owned both their bodies and their souls.\nHe understood that they would never rebel . . . not unless he gave them a\nnew god.”\n“Yes,” Renoux said, stepping forward. The light glittered off his face, and\nVin gasped in surprise.\n“Kelsier!” she screamed.\nHam grabbed her shoulder. “Careful, child. It’s not him.”\nThe creature looked at her. It wore Kelsier’s face, but the eyes . . . they\nwere different. The face didn’t bear Kelsier’s characteristic smile. It seemed\nhollow. Dead.\n“I apologize,” it said. “This was to be my part in the plan, and is the\nreason Kelsier originally contracted with me. I was to take his bones once\nhe was dead, then appear to his followers to give them faith and strength.”\n“What are you?” Vin asked with horror.\nRenoux-Kelsier looked at her, and then his face shimmered, becoming\ntransparent. She could see his bones through the gelatinous skin. It\nreminded her of . . .\n“A mistwraith.”\n“A kandra,” the creature said, its skin losing its transparency. “A\nmistwraith that has . . . grown up, you might say.”\nVin turned away in revulsion, remembering the creatures she had seen in\nthe mist. Scavengers, Kelsier had said . . . creatures that digested the bodies\nof the dead, stealing their skeletons and images. The legends are even more\ntrue than I thought.\n“You were part of this plan too,” the kandra said. “All of you. You ask\nwhy he needed a crew? He needed men of virtue, men who could learn to\nworry more for the people than for coin. He put you before armies and\ncrowds, letting you practice leadership. He was using you . . . but he was\nalso training you.”\nThe creature looked to Dockson, Breeze, then Ham. “Bureaucrat,\npolitician, general. For a new nation to be born, it will need men of your\nindividual talents.” The kandra nodded to a large sheet of paper affixed to a\ntable a short distance away. “That is for you to follow.

Yet, the creature itself wasn’t like Renoux\nor Kelsier. It seemed passionless.\nThe kandra held up a small pouch. “He asked me to give you this.” It\ndropped the pouch into her hand, then continued on, the crew giving it a\nwide berth as it left the warehouse.\nBreeze started toward the table first, but Ham and Dockson beat him to it.\nVin looked down at the bag. She was . . . afraid to see what it contained.\nShe hurried forward, joining the crew.\nThe sheet was a map of the city, apparently copied from the one Marsh\nhad sent. Written at the top were some words.\nMy friends, you have a lot of work to do, and you must do it quickly. You must organize and distribute the weapons in this warehouse, then you must do the same in two\nothers like it located in the other slums. There are horses in a side room for ease of travel.\nOnce you distribute the weapons, you must secure the city gates and subdue the remaining members of the Garrison. Breeze, your team will do this—march on the\nGarrison first, so that you can take the gates in peace.\nThere are four Great Houses that retain a strong military presence in the city. I have marked them on the map. Ham, your team will deal with these. We don’t want\nan armed force other than our own inside the city.\nDockson, remain behind while the initial strikes happen. More and more skaa will come to the warehouses once word gets out. Breeze and Ham’s armies will\ninclude the troops we have trained, as well as augmentations—I hope—from the skaa gathering in the streets. You will need to make certain that the regular skaa get their\nweapons, so that Clubs can lead the assault on the palace itself.\nThe Soothing stations should already be gone—Renoux delivered the proper order to our assassin teams before he came to get you to bring you here. If you have\ntime, send some of Ham’s Thugs to check out those stations. Breeze, your own Soothers will be needed amongst the skaa to encourage them to bravery.\nI think that’s everything. It was a fun job, wasn’t it? When you remember me, please remember that. Remember to smile. Now, move quickly.\nMay you rule in wisdom.\nThe map had the city divided, with the various divisions labeled with\nvarious crewmembers’ names. Vin noticed that she, along with Sazed, were\nleft out. “I’ll go back to that group we left by our house,” Clubs said in a\ngrumbling voice. “Bring them here to get weapons.”\nHe began to hobble away. “Clubs?” Ham said, turning. “No offense, but .\n. . why did he include you as an army leader? What do you know of\nwarfare?”\nClubs snorted, then lifted up his trouser leg, showing the long, twisting\nscar that ran up the side of his calf and thigh—obviously the source of his\nlimp. “Where do you think I got this?” he said, then began to move away.\nHam turned back with wonder. “I don’t believe this is happening.”"

Kell showed us how to kill Inquisitors—we’ll just need to\npull down the others and behead them. As for the Lord Ruler . . .”\nEyes turned on Vin. She looked down at the pouch in her hand, and\npulled it open. A smaller sack, obviously filled with atium beads, fell into\nher hand. It was followed by a small bar of metal wrapped in a sheet of\npaper. The Eleventh Metal.\nVin unwrapped the paper.\nVin, it read. Your original duty tonight was going to be to assassinate the\nhigh noblemen remaining in the city. But, well, you convinced me that\nmaybe they should live.\nI could never figure out how this blasted metal was supposed to work. It’s\nsafe to burn—it won’t kill you—but it doesn’t appear to do anything useful.\nIf you’re reading this, then I failed to figure out how to use it when I faced\nthe Lord Ruler. I don’t think it matters. The people needed something to\nbelieve in, and this was the only way to give it to them.\nPlease don’t be angry at me for abandoning you. I was given an\nextension on life. I should have died in Mare’s place years ago. I was ready\nfor this.\nThe others will need you. You’re their Mistborn now—you’ll have to\nprotect them in the months to come. The nobility will send assassins against\nour fledgling kingdom’s rulers.\nFarewell. I’ll tell Mare about you. She always wanted a daughter.\n“What does it say, Vin?” Ham asked.\n“It . . . says that he doesn’t know how the Eleventh Metal works. He’s\nsorry—he wasn’t certain how to defeat the Lord Ruler.”\n“We’ve got an entire city full of people to fight him,” Dox said. “I\nseriously doubt he can kill us all—if we can’t destroy him, we’ll just tie him\nup and toss him in a dungeon.”\nThe others nodded.\n“All right!” Dockson said. “Breeze and Ham, you need to get to those\nother warehouses and begin giving out weapons. Spook, go fetch the\napprentices—we’ll need them to run messages. Let’s go!”\nEveryone scattered. Soon, the skaa they had seen earlier burst into the\nwarehouse, holding their torches high, looking in awe at the wealth of\nweaponry. Dockson worked efficiently, ordering some of the newcomers to\nbe distributors, sending others to go gather their friends and family. Men\nbegan to gear up, gathering weapons. Everyone was busy except for Vin.\nShe looked up at Sazed, who smiled at her. “Sometimes we just have to\nwait long enough, Mistress,” he said. “Then we find out why exactly it was\nthat we kept believing. There is a saying that Master Kelsier was fond of.”\n“There’s always another secret,” Vin whispered. “But Saze, everyone has"

I was originally supposed to go assassinate\nnoblemen, but Kell doesn’t want me to do that anymore.”\n“They have to be neutralized,” Sazed said, “but not necessarily murdered.\nPerhaps your place was simply to show Kelsier that fact?”\nVin shook her head. “No. I have to do more, Saze.” She gripped the\nempty pouch, frustrated. Something crinkled inside of it.\nShe looked down, opening the pouch and noticing a piece of paper that\nshe hadn’t seen before. She pulled it out and unfolded it delicately. It was\nthe drawing that Kelsier had shown her—the picture of a flower. Mare had\nalways kept it with her, dreaming of a future where the sun wasn’t red,\nwhere plants were green. . . .\nVin looked up.\nBureaucrat, politician, soldier . . . there’s something else that every\nkingdom needs.\nA good assassin.\nShe turned, pulling out a vial of metal and drinking its contents, using the\nliquid to wash down a couple beads of atium. She walked over to the pile of\nweapons, picking up a small bundle of arrows. They had stone heads. She\nbegan breaking the heads off, leaving about a half inch of wood attached to\nthem, discarding the fletched shafts.\n“Mistress?” Sazed asked with concern.\nVin walked past him, searching through the armaments. She found what\nshe wanted in a shirtlike piece of armor, constructed from large rings of\ninterlocking metal. She pried a handful of these free with a dagger and\npewter-enhanced fingers.\n“Mistress, what are you doing?”\nVin walked over to a trunk beside the table, within which she had seen a\nlarge collection of powdered metals. She filled her pouch with several\nhandfuls of pewter dust.\n“I’m worried about the Lord Ruler,” she said, taking a file from the box\nand scraping off a few flakes of the Eleventh Metal. She paused—eyeing\nthe unfamiliar, silvery metal—then swallowed the flakes with a gulp from\nher flask. She put a couple more flakes in one of her backup metal vials.\n“Surely the rebellion can deal with him,” Sazed said. “He is not so strong\nwithout all of his servants, I think.”\n“You’re wrong,” Vin said, rising and walking toward the door. “He’s\nstrong, Saze. Kelsier couldn’t feel him, not like I can. He didn’t know.”\n“Where are you going?” Sazed asked behind her.\nVin paused in the doorway, turning, mist curling around her. “Inside the\npalace complex, there is a chamber protected by soldiers and Inquisitors.\nKelsier tried to get into it twice.” She turned back toward the dark mists.\n“Tonight, I’m going to find out what’s inside of it.”\nI have decided that I am thankful for Rashek’s hatred. It does me well to remember that there are those who abhor me. My place is not to seek popularity or love; my place\nis to ensure mankind’s survival.\n36\nV T K Shaw.

It was like a radiant\ndome over the city.\nThe light was yellow, the color Kelsier had always said the sun should\nbe.\nFour nervous guards waited at the same palace doorway that she and\nKelsier had attacked before. They watched her approach. Vin stepped\nslowly, quietly, on the mist-wetted stones, her mistcloak rustling solemnly.\nOne of the guards lowered a spear at her, and Vin stopped right in front\nof him.\n“I know you,” she said quietly. “You endured the mills, the mines, and\nthe forges. You knew that someday they would kill you, and leave your\nfamilies to starve. So, you went to the Lord Ruler—guilty but determined—\nand joined his guards.”\nThe four men glanced at each other, confused.\n“The light behind me comes from a massive skaa rebellion,” she said.\n“The entire city is rising up against the Lord Ruler. I don’t blame you men\nfor your choices, but a time of change is coming. Those rebels could use\nyour training and your knowledge. Go to them—they gather in the Square\nof the Survivor.”\n“The . . . Square of the Survivor?” a soldier asked.\n“The place where the Survivor of Hathsin was killed earlier today.”\nThe four men exchanged looks, uncertain.\nVin Rioted their emotions slightly. “You don’t have to live with the guilt\nanymore.”\nFinally, one of the men stepped forward and ripped the symbol off his\nuniform, then strode determinedly into the night. The other three paused,\nthen followed—leaving Vin with an open entrance to the palace.\nVin walked down the corridor, eventually passing the same guard\nchamber as before. She strode inside—stepping past a group of chatting\nguards without hurting any of them—and entered the hallway beyond.\nBehind her, the guards shook off their surprise and called out in alarm. They\nburst into the corridor, but Vin jumped and Pushed against the lantern\nbrackets, hurling herself down the hallway.\nThe men’s voices grew distant; even running, they wouldn’t be able to\nkeep up with her. She reached the end of the corridor, then let herself drop\nlightly to the ground, enveloping cloak falling around her body. She\ncontinued her resolute, unhurried pace. There was no reason to run. They’d\nbe waiting for her anyway.\nShe passed through the archway, stepping into the dome-roofed central\nchamber. Silver murals lined the walls, braziers burned in the corners, the\nfloor was an ebony marble.\nAnd two Inquisitors stood blocking her path.\nVin strode quietly through the room, approaching the building-within-a-\nbuilding that was her goal.\n“We search all this time,” said an Inquisitor in his grinding voice. “And\nyou come to us. A second time.”\nVin stopped, standing about twenty feet in front of the pair.

The lead Inquisitor chuckled, raising a hand and Pushing disdainfully\nagainst the missiles.\nHis Push ripped the unattached rings free from the hafts, shooting the bits\nof metal backward. The arrowheads themselves, however, continued\nforward—no longer Pushed from behind, but still carried by a deadly\nmomentum.\nThe Inquisitor opened his mouth in surprise as two dozen arrowheads\nstruck him. Several punched completely through his flesh, continuing on to\nsnap against the stone wall behind him. Several others struck his companion\nin the legs.\nThe lead Inquisitor jerked, spasming as he collapsed. The other growled,\nstaying on his feet, but wobbling a bit on the weakened leg. Vin dashed\nforward, flaring her pewter. The remaining Inquisitor moved to block her,\nbut she reached inside her cloak and threw out a large handful of pewter\ndust.\nThe Inquisitor stopped, confused. To his “eyes” he would see nothing but\na mess of blue lines—each one leading to a speck of metal. With so many\nsources of metal concentrated in one place, the lines would be virtually\nblinding.\nThe Inquisitor spun, angry, as Vin dashed past him. He Pushed against\nthe dust, blowing it away, but as he did so, Vin whipped out a glass dagger\nand flipped it toward him. In the confusing mess of blue lines and atium\nshadows, he missed noticing the dagger, and it took him square in the thigh.\nHe fell, cursing in a crackly voice.\nGood thing that worked, Vin thought, leaping over the groaning body of\nthe first Inquisitor.

She didn’t turn back to fight the two further—not with\nthe trouble one of the creatures had given Kelsier. Her goal this infiltration\nwasn’t to kill, but to gather information, then run.\nVin burst into the building-within-a-building, nearly tripping on a rug\nmade from some exotic fur.

The clue to defeating him—the\nway to win this battle. She was counting on the Inquisitors being distracted\nby their wounds long enough for her to search out the Lord Ruler’s secret\nand escape.\nThe room had only one exit—the entrance she’d come through—and a\nhearth burned in the center of the chamber. The walls were decorated with\nodd trappings; furs hung from most places, the pelts dyed in strange\npatterns.

It was packed full of strange objects and\ndecorations—like the horns of some foreign beast and a strange pair of\nshoes with very wide, flat bottoms. It was the room of a pack rat, a place to\nkeep memories of the past.\nShe jumped as something moved near the center of the room. A pivoting\nchair stood by the hearth, and it spun slowly, revealing the wizened old man\nwho sat in it. Bald, with liver-spotted skin, he appeared to be in his\nseventies. He wore rich, dark clothing, and he frowned angrily at Vin.\nThat’s it, Vin thought. I’ve failed—there’s nothing here. Time to get out.\nJust as she was spinning to dash away, however, rough hands grabbed her\nfrom behind. She cursed, struggling as she glanced down at the Inquisitor’s\nbloodied leg. Even with pewter, he shouldn’t have been able to walk on it.\nShe tried to twist away, but the Inquisitor had her in a powerful grasp.\n“What is this?” the old man demanded, standing.\n“I’m sorry, Lord Ruler,” the Inquisitor said deferentially.\nLord Ruler! But . . . I saw him. He was a young man.\n“Kill her,” the old man said, waving his hand.\n“My lord,” the Inquisitor said. “This child is . . . of special interest. Might\nI keep her for a time?”\n“What special interest?” the Lord Ruler said, sighing as he sat again.\n“We wish to petition you, Lord Ruler,” said the Inquisitor. “Regarding\nthe Canton of Orthodoxy.”\n“This again?” the Lord Ruler said wearily.\n“Please, my lord,” said the Inquisitor. Vin continued to struggle, flaring\nher pewter. The Inquisitor pinned her arms to her sides, however, and her\nbackward kicking did very little good. He’s so strong! she thought with\nfrustration.\nAnd then, she remembered it. The Eleventh Metal, its power sitting\nwithin her, forming an unfamiliar reserve. She looked up, glaring at the old\nman. This had better work. She burned the Eleventh Metal.\nNothing happened.\nVin struggled in frustration, her heart sinking. And then she saw him.\nAnother man, standing right beside the Lord Ruler. Where had he come\nfrom? She hadn’t seen him enter.\nHe had a full beard and wore a thick, woolen outfit with a fur-lined cloak.\nIt wasn’t rich clothing, but it was well constructed. He stood quietly,\nseeming . . . content. He smiled happily.\nVin cocked her head. There was something familiar about the man. His\nfeatures looked very similar to those of the man who had killed Kelsier.\nHowever, this man was older and . . . more alive.\nVin turned to the side. There was another unfamiliar man beside her, a\nyoung nobleman. He was a merchant, from the looks of his suit—and a very\nwealthy one at that.\nWhat is going on?\nThe Eleventh Metal burned out.

We will meet in several hours’ time—Tevidian has already\nrequested a gathering to discuss matters outside the palace.”\n“Ah,” said the second Inquisitor. “Yes . . . it will be good for him to be\nthere. Good indeed.”\nVin continued to squirm as the Inquisitor pushed her to the ground, then\nlifted his hand, gripping something she couldn’t see. He swung, and pain\nflashed through her head.\nDespite her pewter, all went black.\nElend found his father in the north entryway—a smaller, less daunting\nentrance to Keep Venture, though only when compared with the majestic\ngrand hall.\n“What’s going on?” Elend demanded, pulling on his suit coat, his hair\ndisheveled from sleep. Lord Venture stood with his guard captains and\ncanalmasters. Soldiers and servants scattered through the white-and-brown\nhallway, rushing about with an air of apprehensive fright.\nLord Venture ignored Elend’s question, calling for a messenger to ride for\nthe east river docks.\n“Father, what’s happening?” Elend repeated.\n“Skaa rebellion,” Lord Venture snapped.\nWhat? Elend thought as Lord Venture waved for another group of\nsoldiers to approach. Impossible. A skaa rebellion in Luthadel itself . . . it\nwas unthinkable. They didn’t have the disposition to try such a bold move,\nthey were just . . .\nValette is skaa, he thought. You have to stop thinking like other noblemen,\nElend. You have to open your eyes.\nThe Garrison was gone, off to slaughter a different group of rebels. The\nskaa had been forced to watch those gruesome executions weeks ago, not to\nmention the slaughter that had come this day. They had been stressed to the\npoint of breaking.\nTemadre predicted this, Elend realized. So did half a dozen other political\ntheorists. They said that the Final Empire couldn’t last forever. God at its\nhead or not, the people would someday rise up. . . . It’s finally happening.\nI’m living through it!\nAnd . . . I’m on the wrong side.\n“Why the canalmasters?” Elend asked.\n“We’re leaving the city,” Lord Venture said tersely.\n“Abandon the keep?” Elend asked. “Where’s the honor in that?”\nLord Venture snorted. “This isn’t about bravery, boy. It’s about survival.\nThose skaa are attacking the main gates, slaughtering the remnants of the\nGarrison. I have no intention of waiting until they come for noble heads.”\n“But . . .”\nLord Venture shook his head. “We were leaving anyway. Something . . .\nhappened at the Pits a few days ago. The Lord Ruler isn’t going to be happy\nwhen he discovers it.” He stepped back, waving over his lead narrowboat\ncaptain.\nSkaa rebellion, Elend thought, still a little numb.

That, when a real rebellion finally came,\nthe skaa would slaughter wantonly . . . that every nobleman’s life would be\nforfeit.\nHe predicted that the rebellion would die out quickly, but that it would\nleave piles of corpses in its wake. Thousands of deaths. Tens of thousands.\n“Well, boy?” Lord Venture demanded. “Go and organize your things.”\n“I’m not going,” Elend surprised himself by saying.\nLord Venture frowned. “What?”\nElend looked up. “I’m not going, Father.”\n“Oh, you’re going,” Lord Venture said, eyeing Elend with one of his\nglares.\nElend looked into those eyes—eyes that were angry not because they\ncared for Elend’s safety, but because Elend dared defy them. And, strangely,\nElend didn’t feel the least bit cowed. Someone has to stop this. The\nrebellion could do some good, but only if the skaa don’t insist on\nslaughtering their allies. And, that’s what the nobility should be—their\nallies against the Lord Ruler. He’s our enemy too.\n“Father, I’m serious,” Elend said. “I’m going to stay.”\n“Bloody hell, boy! Must you insist on mocking me?”\n“This isn’t about balls or luncheons, father. It’s about something more\nimportant.”\nLord Venture paused. “No flippant comments? No buffoonery?”\nElend shook his head.\nSuddenly, Lord Venture smiled. “Stay then, boy. That’s a good idea.\nSomeone should maintain our presence here while I go rally our forces. Yes\n. . . a very good idea.”\nElend paused, frowning slightly at the smile in his father’s eyes. The\natium—Father is setting me up to fall in his place! And . . . even if the Lord\nRuler doesn’t kill me, Father assumes I’ll die in the rebellion. Either way,\nhe’s rid of me.\nI’m really not very good at this, am I?\nLord Venture laughed to himself, turning.\n“At least leave me some soldiers,” Elend said.\n“You can have most of them,” Lord Venture said. “It will be hard enough\nto get one boat out in this mess. Good luck, boy. Say hello to the Lord Ruler\nin my absence.” He laughed again, moving toward his stallion, which was\nsaddled and readied outside.\nElend stood in the hall, and suddenly he was the focus of attention.\nNervous guards and servants, realizing that they’d been abandoned, turned\nto Elend with desperate eyes.\nI’m . . . in charge, Elend thought with shock. Now what? Outside, he\ncould see the mists flaring with the light of burning fires. Several of the\nguards were yelling about an approaching mob of skaa.\nElend walked to the open doorway, staring out into the chaos. The hall\ngrew quiet behind him, terrified people realizing the extent of their danger.\nElend stood for a long moment. Then he spun. “Captain!” he said.\n“Gather your forces and the remaining servants—don’t leave anyone behind\n—then march to Keep Lekal.”"

We’ll\noffer our men to the Lekal in exchange for protecting our people.”\n“But . . . my lord,” the soldier said. “The Lekal are your enemies.”\nElend nodded. “Yes, but someone needs to make the first overture. Now,\nget moving!”\nThe man saluted, then rushed into motion.\n“Oh, and Captain?” Elend said.\nThe soldier paused.\n“Pick out five of your best soldiers to be my honor guard. I’ll be leaving\nyou in charge—those five and I have another mission.”\n“My lord?” the captain asked with confusion. “What mission?”\nElend turned back toward the mists. “We’re going to go turn ourselves\nin.”\nVin awoke to wetness. She coughed, then groaned, feeling a sharp pain in\nthe back of her skull. She opened dizzy eyes—blinking away the water that\nhad been thrown on her—and immediately burned pewter and tin, bringing\nherself completely awake.\nA pair of rough hands hoisted her into the air. She coughed as the\nInquisitor shoved something into her mouth.\n“Swallow,” he ordered, twisting her arm.\nVin cried out, trying without success to resist the pain. Eventually, she\ngave in and swallowed the bit of metal.\n“Now burn it,” the Inquisitor ordered, twisting harder.\nVin resisted nonetheless, sensing the unfamiliar metal reserve within her.\nThe Inquisitor could be trying to get her to burn a useless metal, one that\nwould make her sick—or, worse, kill her.\nBut, there are easier ways to kill a captive, she thought in agony. Her arm\nhurt so much that it felt like it would twist free. Finally, Vin relented,\nburning the metal.\nImmediately, all of her other metal reserves vanished.\n“Good,” the Inquisitor said, dropping her to the ground. The stones were\nwet, pooled with a bucketful of water. The Inquisitor turned, leaving the cell\nand slamming its barred door; then he disappeared through a doorway on\nthe other side of the room.\nVin crawled to her knees, massaging her arm, trying to sort out what was\ngoing on. My metals! She searched desperately inside, but she found\nnothing. She couldn’t feel any metals, not even the one she had ingested\nmoments before.\nWhat was it? A twelfth metal? Perhaps Allomancy wasn’t as limited as\nKelsier and the others had always assured her.\nShe took a few deep breaths, climbing to her knees, calming herself.\nThere was something . . . Pushing against her. The Lord Ruler’s presence.\nShe could feel it, though it wasn’t as powerful as it had been earlier, when\nhe had killed Kelsier.

I have to stay strong!\nShe forced herself to stand and inspect her surroundings. Her prison was\nmore like a cage than a cell. It had bars running along three of the four\nsides, and it contained no furniture—not even a sleeping mat. There were\ntwo other cell-cages in the room, one to either side of her.\nShe had been stripped, they had only left her with her undergarments.\nThe move was probably to make certain that she didn’t have any hidden\nmetals. She glanced around the room. It was long and thin, and had stark\nstone walls. A stool sat in one corner, but the room was otherwise empty.\nIf I could find just a bit of metal . . .\nShe began to search. Instinctively, she tried to burn iron, expecting the\nblue lines to appear—but, of course, she had no iron to burn. She shook her\nhead at the foolish move, but it was simply a sign of how much she’d come\nto rely on her Allomancy. She felt . . . blinded. She couldn’t burn tin to\nlisten for voices. She couldn’t burn pewter to strengthen her against the pain\nof her hurting arm and head. She couldn’t burn bronze to search for nearby\nAllomancers.\nNothing. She had nothing.\nYou functioned without Allomancy before, she told herself sternly. You\ncan do it now.\nEven so, she searched the bare floor of her cell, hoping for the chance\nexistence of a discarded pin or nail. She found nothing, so she turned her\nattention to the bars. However, she couldn’t think of a way to get off even a\nflake of the iron.\nSo much metal here, she thought with frustration. And I can’t use any of\nit!\nShe sat back on the ground, huddling up against the stone wall, shivering\nquietly in her damp clothing. It was still dark outside; the room’s window\ncasually allowed in a few trails of mist. What had happened with the\nrebellion? What about her friends? She thought that the mists outside\nlooked a bit brighter than usual. Torchlight in the night? Without tin, her\nsenses were too weak to tell.\nWhat was I thinking? she thought with despair. Did I presume to succeed\nwhere Kelsier had failed? He knew that the Eleventh Metal was useless.\nIt had done something, true—but it certainly hadn’t killed the Lord Ruler.\nShe sat, thinking, trying to figure out what had happened. There had been an\nodd familiarity about the things the Eleventh Metal had shown her. Not\nbecause of the way the visions had appeared, but because of the way Vin\nhad felt when burning the metal.\nGold. The moment when I burned the Eleventh Metal felt like that time\nwhen Kelsier had me burn gold.\nCould it be that the Eleventh Metal wasn’t really “eleventh” at all?

They’re like . . .\nLike the other metals, which were grouped into larger bases of four.\nThere were the physical metals: iron, steel, tin, and pewter. The mental\nmetals: bronze, copper, zinc, and brass. And . . . there were the time-\naffecting metals: gold and its alloy, and atium and its alloy.\nThat means there’s another metal. One that hasn’t been discovered—\nprobably because atium and gold are too valuable to forge into different\nalloys.\nBut, what good was the knowledge? Her “Eleventh Metal” was probably\njust a paired opposite of gold—the metal Kelsier had told her was the most\nuseless of them all. Gold had shown Vin herself—or, at least, a different\nversion of her that had felt real enough to touch. But, it had simply been a\nvision of what she could have become, had the past been different.\nThe Eleventh Metal had done something similar: Instead of showing\nVin’s own past, it had shown her similar images from other people. And that\ntold her . . . nothing. What difference did it make what the Lord Ruler could\nhave been? It was the current man, the tyrant that ruled the Final Empire,\nthat she had to defeat.\nA figure appeared in the doorway—an Inquisitor dressed in a black robe,\nthe hood up.

The door clicked, and she sprang to her feet, scrambling\nforward.\nHave I always been this slow without pewter? she thought with horror.\nThe Inquisitor snatched her arm as she passed, his motions unconcerned,\nalmost casual—and she could see why.

Her captor carried her out of the chamber\nand through a narrow hallway. She cried out for help, knowing that her\nscreams—in the middle of Kredik Shaw itself—would be useless. At least\nshe succeeded in annoying the Inquisitor, for he twisted her arm.\n“Quiet,” he said as she grunted in pain.\nVin fell silent, instead focusing on their location. They were probably in\none of the lower sections of the palace; the hallways were too long to be in\na tower or spire. The decorations were lavish, but the rooms looked . . .\nunused. The carpets were pristine, the furniture unmarked by scuff or\nscratch. She had the feeling that the murals were rarely seen, even by those\nwho often passed through the chambers.\nEventually, the Inquisitors entered a stairwell and began to climb. One of\nthe spires, she thought.\nWith each climbing step, Vin could feel the Lord Ruler getting closer. His\nmere presence dampened her emotions, stealing her willpower, making her\nnumb to everything but lonely depression. She sagged in the Inquisitor’s\ngrip, no longer struggling. It took all of her energy to simply resist the Lord\nRuler’s pressure on her soul.\nAfter a short time in the tunnel-like stairwell, the Inquisitors carried her\nout into a large, circular room. And, despite the power of the Lord Ruler’s\nSoothing, despite her visits to noble keeps, Vin took just a brief moment to\nstare at her surroundings. They were majestic like none she’d ever seen.\nThe room was shaped like a massive, stocky cylinder. The wall—there\nwas only one, running in a wide circle—was made entirely of glass. Lit by\nfires from behind, the room glowed with spectral light. The glass was\ncolored, though it didn’t depict any specific scene. Instead, it seemed\ncrafted from a single sheet, the colors blown and melded together in long,\nthin trails. Like . . .\nLike mist, she thought with wonder. Colorful streams of mist, running in\na circle around the entire room.\nThe Lord Ruler sat in an elevated throne in the very center of the room.\nHe wasn’t the old Lord Ruler—this was the younger version, the handsome\nman who had killed Kelsier.\nSome kind of impostor? No, I can feel him—just as I could feel the one\nbefore. They’re the same man. Can he change how he looks, then?\nAppearing young when he wishes to put forth a pretty face?\nA small group of gray-robed, eye-tattooed obligators stood conversing on\nthe far side of the room. Seven Inquisitors stood waiting, like a row of\nshadows with iron eyes. That made nine of them in all, counting the two\nthat had escorted Vin. Her scar-faced captor delivered her to one of the\nothers, who held her with a similarly inescapable grip.\n“Let us be on with this,” said the Lord Ruler.\nA regular obligator stepped forward, bowing. With a chill, she realized\nthat she recognized him."

He doesn’t know who I am,\nshe thought. He never knew he was a father.\n“My lord,” Tevidian said, turning away from her. “Look outside your\nwindow! Do we not have better things to discuss? The entire city is in\nrebellion! Skaa torches light up the night, and they dare go out into the\nmists. They blaspheme in riots, attacking the keeps of the nobility!”\n“Let them,” the Lord Ruler said in an uncaring voice. He seemed so . . .\nworn. He sat strongly on his throne, but there was still a weariness to his\nposture and his voice.\n“But my lord!” Tevidian said. “The Great Houses are falling!”\nThe Lord Ruler waved a dismissive hand. “It is good for them to get\npurged every century or so. It fosters instability, keeps the aristocracy from\ngrowing too confident. Usually, I let them kill each other in one of their\nfoolish wars, but these riots will work.”\n“And . . . if the skaa come to the palace?”\n“Then I will deal with them,” the Lord Ruler said softly. “You will not\nquestion this further.”\n“Yes, my lord,” Tevidian said, bowing and backing away.\n“Now,” the Lord Ruler said, turning to the Inquisitors. “What is it you\nwished to present?”\nThe scarred Inquisitor stepped forward. “Lord Ruler, we wish to petition\nthat leadership of your Ministry be taken from these . . . men and granted to\nthe Inquisitors instead.”\n“We have discussed this,” the Lord Ruler said. “You and your brothers\nare needed for more important tasks. You are too valuable to waste on\nsimple administration.”\n“But,” the Inquisitor said, “by allowing common men to rule your\nMinistry, you have unwittingly allowed corruption and vice to enter the\nvery heart of your holy palace!”\n“Idle claims!” Tevidian spat. “You say such things often, Kar, but you\nnever offer any proof.”\nKar turned slowly, his eerie smile lit by the twisting, colored\nwindowlight. Vin shivered. That smile was nearly as unsettling as the Lord\nRuler’s Soothing.\n“Proof?” Kar asked. “Why, tell me, Lord Prelan. Do you recognize that\ngirl?”\n“Bah, of course not!” Tevidian said with a wave of his hand. “What does\na skaa girl have to do with the government of the Ministry?”\n“Everything,” Kar said, turning to Vin. “Oh, yes . . . everything.

He can see things in the way your heart beats, and can read\nyour emotions in your eyes. He can sense the moment when you lie. He\nknows . . . oh, yes.

If the Inquisitor wanted to\nknow something, then keeping it a secret seemed like a good idea. “I’m just\na street urchin.”\n“A Mistborn street urchin?” Kar asked. “Why, that’s interesting. Isn’t it,\nTevidian?”\nThe lord prelan paused, his frown deepening. The Lord Ruler stood\nslowly, walking down the steps of his dais toward Vin.\n“Yes, my lord,” Kar said. “You felt her Allomancy earlier. You know that\nshe is a full Mistborn—an amazingly powerful one. Yet, she claims to have\ngrown up on the street. What noble house would have abandoned such a\nchild? Why, for her to have such strength, she must be of an extremely pure\nline. At least . . . one of her parents must have been from a very pure line.”\n“What are you implying?” Tevidian demanded, paling.\nThe Lord Ruler ignored them both. He strode through the streaming\ncolors of the reflective floor, then stopped right in front of Vin.\nSo close, she thought. His Soothing was so strong that she couldn’t even\nfeel terror—all she felt was the deep, overpowering, horrible sorrow.\nThe Lord Ruler reached out with delicate hands, taking her by the\ncheeks, tilting her face up to look into his eyes. “Who is your father, girl?”\nhe asked quietly.\n“I . . .” Despair twisted inside of her. Grief, pain, a desire to die.\nThe Lord Ruler held her face close to his own, looking into her eyes. In\nthat moment, she knew the truth. She could see a piece of him; she could\nsense his power. His . . . godlike power.\nHe wasn’t worried about the skaa rebellion. Why would he have to\nworry? If he wished, he could slaughter every person in the city by himself.\nVin knew it to be the truth. It might take him time, but he could kill forever,\ntirelessly. He need fear no rebellion.\nHe’d never needed to. Kelsier had made a terrible, terrible mistake.\n“Your father, child,” the Lord Ruler prompted, his demand like a physical\nweight upon her soul.\nVin spoke despite herself. “My . . . brother told me that my father was\nthat man over there. The lord prelan.” Tears rolled down her cheeks, though\nwhen the Lord Ruler turned from her, she couldn’t quite remember why she\nhad been crying.\n“It’s a lie, my lord!” Tevidian said, backing away. “What does she know?"

It worked.\nKelsier’s part in the plan—the vision, the charismatic leadership—was\nfinished. Now it was Dockson’s turn. He took Kelsier’s original strategy\nand modified it. He was careful to keep the chaos at a manageable level,\nrationing the best equipment to the men who seemed the most stable. He\nsent contingents to capture points of interest—food and water deposits—\nbefore general rioting could steal them.\nIn short, he did what he always did: He made Kelsier’s dreams become\nreality.\nA disturbance came from the front of the room, and Dockson looked up\nas a messenger rushed in.

He was a young man, in an imperial\nuniform, though he had removed the jacket to make himself look less\nobtrusive. “I’m sorry, sir,” the man said quietly. “None of the guards have\nseen her come out, and . . . well, one claimed he saw her being carried\ntoward the palace dungeons.”\n“Can you get her out?” Dockson asked.\nThe soldier—Goradel—paled.

Yet, the soldier—as a former palace\nguardsman—could get into places that other skaa could not. His former\nallies didn’t know he’d switched sides.\nAssuming he really has switched sides, Dockson thought. But . . . well,\nthings were moving too quickly now for self-doubt. Dockson had decided\nto use this man. He’d have to trust his initial instincts.\n“Well?” Dockson repeated.\nGoradel shook his head. “There was an Inquisitor holding her captive,\nsir. I couldn’t free her—I wouldn’t have the authority. I don’t . . . I . . .”\nDockson sighed. Damn fool girl! he thought. She should have had better\nsense than this. Kelsier must have rubbed off on her.\nHe waved the soldier away, then looked up as Hammond walked in, a\nlarge sword with a broken hilt resting on his shoulder.\n“It’s done,” Ham said. “Keep Elariel just fell. Looks like Lekal is still\nholding, however.”\nDockson nodded. “We’ll need your men at the palace soon.” The sooner\nwe break in there, the better chance we have of saving Vin. However, his\ninstincts told him that they’d be too late to help her. The main forces would\ntake hours to gather and organize; he wanted to attack the palace with all of\ntheir armies in tandem. The truth was he just couldn’t afford to spare men\non a rescue operation at the moment.

The\npalace was not a place to attack without substantial preparation; Vin’s\nfailure proved that much. She’d just have to look after herself for the\nmoment.\n“I’ll get my men ready,” Ham said, nodding as he tossed his sword aside.\n“I’m going to need a new sword, though.”\nDockson sighed. “You Thugs. Always breaking things. Go see what you\ncan find, then.”\nHam moved off.\n“If you see Sazed,” Dockson called, “tell him that . . .”\nDockson paused, his attention drawn by a group of skaa rebels who\nmarched into the room, pulling a bound prisoner with a cloth sack on his\nhead.\n“What is this?” Dockson demanded.\nOne of the rebels elbowed his captive. “I think he’s someone important,\nm’lord. Came to us unarmed, asked to be brought to you. Promised us gold\nif we did it.”\nDockson raised an eyebrow. The grunt pulled off the hood, revealing\nElend Venture.\nDockson blinked in surprise. “You?”\nElend looked around. He was apprehensive, obviously, but held himself\nwell, all things considered. “Have we met?”\n“Not exactly,” Dockson said. Blast. I don’t have time for captives right\nnow. Still, the son of the Ventures . . . Dockson was going to need leverage\nwith the powerful nobility when the fighting was over.\n“I’ve come to offer you a truce,” Elend Venture said.\n“ . . . excuse me?” Dockson asked.\n“House Venture will not resist you,” Elend said. “And I can probably talk\nthe rest of the nobility into listening as well. They’re frightened—there’s no\nneed to slaughter them.”\nDockson snorted. “I can’t exactly leave hostile armed forces in the city.”\n“If you destroy the nobility, you won’t be able to hold on for very long,”\nElend said. “We control the economy—the empire will collapse without\nus.”\n“That is kind of the point of this all,” Dockson said. “Look, I don’t have\ntime—”\n“You must hear me out,” Elend Venture said desperately. “If you start\nyour rebellion with chaos and bloodshed, you’ll lose it. I’ve studied these\nthings; I know what I’m talking about! When the momentum of your initial\nconflict runs out, the people will start looking for other things to destroy.\nThey’ll turn on themselves. You must keep control of your armies.”\nDockson paused. Elend Venture was supposed to be a fool and a fop, but\nnow he just seemed . . . earnest.\n“I’ll help you,” Elend said. “Leave the noblemen’s keeps alone and focus\nyour efforts on the Ministry and the Lord Ruler—they’re your real\nenemies.”\n“Look,” Dockson said, “I’ll pull our armies away from Keep Venture.\nThere’s probably no need to fight them now that—”\n“I sent my soldiers to Keep Lekal,” Elend said. “Pull your men away\nfrom all the nobility. They’re not going to attack your flanks—they’ll just\nhole up in their mansions and worry.”"

They’re not going to attack your flanks—they’ll just\nhole up in their mansions and worry.”\nHe’s probably right about that. “We’ll consider . . .” Dockson trailed off,\nnoticing that Elend wasn’t paying attention to him anymore. Blasted hard\nman to have a conversation with.\nElend was staring at Hammond, who had returned with a new sword.\nElend frowned, then his eyes opened wide. “I know you! You were the one\nwho rescued Lord Renoux’s servants from the executions!”\nElend turned back to Dockson, suddenly eager. “Do you know Valette,\nthen? She’ll tell you to listen to me.”\nDockson shared a look with Ham.\n“What?” Elend asked.\n“Vin . . .” Dockson said. “Valette . . . she went into the palace a few hours\nback. I’m sorry, lad. She’s probably in the Lord Ruler’s dungeons right now\n—assuming she’s even still alive.”\nKar tossed Vin back into her cell. She hit the ground hard and rolled, her\nloose undershirt twisting around her, her head knocking against the cell’s\nback wall.\nThe Inquisitor smiled, slamming the door. “Thank you very much,” he\nsaid through the bars. “You just helped us achieve something that has been\na long time in coming.”\nVin glared up at him, the effects of the Lord Ruler’s Soothing weaker\nnow.\n“It is unfortunate that Bendal isn’t here,” Kar said. “He chased your\nbrother for years, swearing that Tevidian had fathered a skaa half-breed.\nPoor Bendal . . . If only the Lord Ruler had left the Survivor to us, so that\nwe could have had revenge.”\nHe looked over at her, shaking his spike-eyed head. “Ah, well. He was\nvindicated in the end. The rest of us believed your brother, but Bendal . . .\neven then he wasn’t convinced—and he found you in the end.”\n“My brother?” Vin said, scrambling to her feet. “He sold me out?”\n“Sold you out?” Kar said. “He died promising us that you had starved to\ndeath years ago! He screamed it night and day beneath the hands of\nMinistry torturers. It is very hard to hold out against the pains of an\nInquisitor’s torture . . . something you shall soon discover.” He smiled.\n“But, first, let me show you something.”\nA group of guards dragged a naked, bound figure into the room. Bruised\nand bleeding, the man stumbled to the stone floor as they pushed him into\nthe cell beside Vin’s.\n“Sazed?” Vin cried, rushing to the bars.\nThe Terrisman lay groggily as the soldiers tied his hands and feet to a\nsmall metal ring set into the stone floor. He had been beaten so severely that\nhe barely seemed conscious, and he was completely naked. Vin turned away\nfrom his nudity, but not before she saw the place between his legs—a\nsimple, empty scar where his manhood should have been.\nAll Terrisman stewards are eunuchs, he had told her. That wound wasn’t\nnew—but the bruises, cuts, and scrapes were fresh."

Perhaps you think me a fool for admitting that your\nbrother’s mind snapped before we drew out his secret. But, you see, I am\nnot so much a fool that I will not admit a mistake. We should have drawn\nout your brother’s torture . . . made him suffer longer. That was an error\nindeed.”\nHe smiled wickedly, nodding to Sazed. “We won’t make that mistake\nagain, child. No—this time, we’re going to try a different tactic. We’re\ngoing to let you watch us torture the Terrisman. We’re going to be very\ncareful, making certain his pain is lasting, and quite vibrant.

The Lord Ruler has commanded my presence—I\nneed to go and receive formal leadership of the Ministry. We’ll begin when\nI return.”\nHe turned, black robe sweeping the ground. The guards followed, likely\ntaking positions in the guard chamber just outside the room.\n“Oh, Sazed,” Vin said, sinking to her knees beside the bars of her cage.\n“Now, Mistress,” Sazed said in a surprisingly lucid voice. “What did we\ntell you about running around in your undergarments? Why, if Master\nDockson were here, he would scold you for certain.”\nVin looked up, shocked. Sazed was smiling at her.\n“Sazed!” she said quietly, glancing in the direction the guards had gone.\n“You’re awake?”\n“Very awake,” he said. His calm, strong voice was a stark contrast to his\nbruised body.\n“I’m sorry, Sazed,” she said. “Why did you follow me? You should have\nstayed back and let me be stupid on my own!”\nHe turned a bruised head toward her, one eye swollen, but the other\nlooking into her eyes. “Mistress,” he said solemnly, “I vowed to Master\nKelsier that I would see to your safety. The oath of a Terrisman is not\nsomething given lightly.”\n“But . . . you should have known you’d be captured,” she said, looking\ndown in shame.\n“Of course I knew, Mistress,” he said. “Why, how else was I going to get\nthem to bring me to you?”\nVin looked up. “Bring you . . . to me?”\n“Yes, Mistress. There is one thing that the Ministry and my own people\nhave in common, I think. They both underestimate the things that we can\naccomplish.”\nHe closed his eyes. And then, his body changed.

Vin paused, lowering her hand, watching Sazed for a\nfew minutes. Could it be . . .\nHe looked so weak—as if his strength, his very muscles, were being\ndrawn away. And perhaps . . . stored somewhere?\nSazed’s eyes snapped open. His body returned to normal; then his\nmuscles continued to grow, becoming large and powerful, growing bigger,\neven, than Ham’s.\nSazed smiled at her from a head sitting atop a beefy, muscular neck; then\nhe easily snapped his bindings. He stood, a massive, inhumanly muscular\nman—so different from the lanky, quiet scholar she had known.\nThe Lord Ruler spoke of their strength in his logbook, she thought with\nwonder. He said the man Rashek lifted a boulder by himself and threw it out\nof their way.\n“But, they took all of your jewelry!” Vin said. “Where did you hide the\nmetal?”\nSazed smiled, grabbing the bars separating their cages. “I took a hint\nfrom you, Mistress. I swallowed it.” With that, he ripped the bars free.\nShe ran into the cage, embracing him. “Thank you.”\n“Of course,” he said, gently pushing her aside, then slamming a massive\npalm against the door to his cell, breaking the lock, sending the door\ncrashing open.\n“Quickly now, Mistress,” Sazed said. “We must get you to safety.”\nThe two guards who had thrown Sazed into the chamber appeared in the\ndoorway a second later. They froze, staring up at the massive beast who\nstood in place of the weak man they had beaten.\nSazed jumped forward, holding one of the bars from Vin’s cage. His\nFeruchemy, however, had obviously given him strength only, no speed. He\nstepped with a lumbering gait, and the guards dashed away, crying for help.\n“Come now, Mistress,” Sazed said, tossing aside the bar. “My strength\nwill not last long—the metal I swallowed wasn’t large enough to hold much\nof a Feruchemical charge.”\nEven as he spoke, he began to shrink. Vin moved past him, scrambling\nout of the room. The guard chamber beyond was quite small, set with only a\npair of chairs. Beneath one, however, she found a cloak rolled around one\nof the guards’ evening meals. Vin shook the cloak free, tossing it to Sazed.\n“Thank you, Mistress,” he said.\nShe nodded, moving to the doorway and peeking out. The larger room\noutside was empty, and had two hallways leading off of it—one going right,\none extending into the distance across from her.

This is where we’ll both end up if we don’t move\nquickly, she thought, waving Sazed forward.\nShe froze mid-step as a group of soldiers appeared in the far hallway, led\nby one of the guards from before. Vin cursed quietly—she would have\nheard them earlier if she’d had tin.\nVin glanced backward. Sazed was hobbling through the guard chamber.\nHis Feruchemical strength was gone, and the soldiers had obviously beaten\nhim soundly before tossing him into the cell. He could barely walk.\n“Go, Mistress!” he said, waving her forward. “Run!”\nYou still have some things to learn about friendship, Vin, Kelsier’s voice\nwhispered in her mind. I hope someday you realize what they are. . . .\nI can’t leave him. I won’t.\nVin dashed toward the soldiers. She swiped a pair of torturing knives\nfrom the table, their bright, polished steel glistening between her fingers.\nShe jumped atop the table, then leapt off of it toward the oncoming soldiers.\nShe had no Allomancy, but she flew true anyway, her months of practice\nhelping despite her lack of metals. She slammed a knife into a surprised\nsoldier’s neck as she fell. She hit the ground harder than she had expected,\nbut managed to scramble away from a second soldier, who cursed and\nswung at her.\nThe sword clanged against the stone behind her. Vin spun, slashing\nanother soldier across the thighs. He stumbled back in pain.\nToo many, she thought. There were at least two dozen of them. She tried\nto jump for a third soldier, but another man swung his quarterstaff,\nslamming the weapon into Vin’s side.\nShe grunted in pain, dropping her knife as she was thrown to the side. No\npewter strengthened her against the fall, and she hit the hard stones with a\ncrack, rolling to a dazed stop beside the wall.\nShe struggled, unsuccessfully, to rise. To her side, she could barely make\nout Sazed collapsing as his body grew suddenly weak. He was trying to\nstore up strength again. He wouldn’t have enough time.

Then he\nnoticed the Ministry soldiers. They seemed a bit confused to be confronted\nby a nobleman, but they still had superior numbers.\n“I’m taking the girl with me!” Elend said.

Spires and towers rose around\nIN PUSHED HERSELF THROUGH THE\nher like the shadowed tines of some phantom monster lurking below. Dark,\nstraight, and ominous, for some reason they made her think of Kelsier, lying\ndead in the street, an obsidian-tipped spear jutting from his chest.\nThe mists spun and swirled as she blew through them. They were still\nthick, but tin let her see a faint glistening on the horizon. Morning was near.\nBelow her, a greater light was building. Vin caught hold of a thin spire,\nletting her momentum spin her around the slick metal, giving her a\nsweeping view of the area. Thousands of torches burned in the night,\nmixing and merging like luminescent insects. They were organized in great\nwaves, converging on the palace.\nThe palace guard doesn’t have a chance against such a force, she\nthought. But, by fighting its way into the palace, the skaa army will seal its\nown doom.\nShe turned to the side, the mist-wetted spire cold beneath her fingers. The\nlast time she had jumped through the spires of Kredik Shaw, she had been\nbleeding and semiconscious. Sazed had arrived to save her, but he wouldn’t\nbe able to help this time.\nA short distance away, she could see the throne tower. It wasn’t difficult\nto spot; a ring of blazing bonfires illuminated its outside, lighting its single\nstained-glass window to those inside. She could feel Him inside. She waited\nfor a few moments, hoping, perhaps, that she might be able to attack after\nthe Inquisitors had left the room.\nKelsier believed that the Eleventh Metal was the key, she thought.\nShe had one idea. It would work. It had to.\n“As of this moment,” the Lord Ruler proclaimed in a loud voice, “the\nCanton of Inquisition is granted organizational dominance of the Ministry.\nInquiries once addressed to Tevidian should now go to Kar.”\nThe throne room fell silent, the collection of high-ranking obligators\ndumbfounded by the night’s events. The Lord Ruler waved a hand,\nindicating that the meeting was finished.\nFinally! Kar thought. He raised his head, his eye-spikes throbbing as\nalways, bringing him pain—but, this evening it was the pain of joy. The\nInquisitors had been waiting for two centuries, carefully politicking, subtly\nencouraging corruption and dissension among the regular obligators. And\nfinally it had worked. The Inquisitors would no longer bow before the\ndictates of inferior men.\nHe turned and smiled toward the group of Ministry priests, knowing full\nwell the discomfort the gaze of an Inquisitor could cause.

These metals were too diffuse to be affected by Allomancy—\nindeed, most Allomancers couldn’t even sense them.\nWith his Inquisitor’s eyes, however, Kar could see the iron-lines of these\nthings—the blue threads were fine, nearly invisible, but they outlined the\nworld for him. The obligators before him were a shuffling mass of blues,\ntheir emotions—discomfort, anger, and fear—showing in their postures.\nDiscomfort, anger, and fear . . . so sweet, all three. Kar’s smile widened,\ndespite his fatigue.\nHe had been awake for too long. Living as an Inquisitor drained the body,\nand he had to rest often. His brethren were already shuffling from the room,\nheading toward their rest chambers, which lay intentionally close to the\nthrone room. They would sleep immediately; with the executions earlier in\nthe day and the excitement of the night, they would be extremely fatigued.\nKar, however, stayed behind as both Inquisitors and obligators left. Soon,\nonly he and the Lord Ruler remained, standing in a room lit by five massive\nbraziers. The external bonfires slowly went out, extinguished by servants,\nleaving the glass panorama dark and black.\n“You finally have what you want,” the Lord Ruler said quietly. “Perhaps\nnow I can have peace in this matter.”\n“Yes, Lord Ruler,” Kar said, bowing. “I think that . . .”\nA strange sound snapped in the air—a soft click. Kar looked up,\nfrowning as a small disk of metal bounced across the floor, eventually\nrolling to a stop against his foot. He picked up the coin, then looked up at\nthe massive window, noting the small hole broken through it.\nWhat?\nDozens more coins zipped through the window, scattering it with holes.\nMetallic clinks and tinkling glass rang in the air. Kar stepped back in\nsurprise.\nThe entire southern section of the window shattered, blasting inward, the\nglass weakened by coins to the point that a soaring body could break\nthrough.\nShards of colorful glass spun in the air, spraying before a small figure\nclad in a fluttering mistcloak and carrying a pair of glittering black daggers.\nThe girl landed in a crouch, skidding a short distance on the bits of glass,\nmist billowing through the opening behind her. It curled forward, drawn by\nher Allomancy, swirling around her body. She crouched for just a moment\nin the mists, as if she were some herald of the night itself.\nThen she sprang forward, dashing directly toward the Lord Ruler.\nVin burned the Eleventh Metal. The Lord Ruler’s past-self appeared as it\nhad before, forming as if out of mist to stand on the dais beside the throne.\nVin ignored the Inquisitor. The creature, fortunately, reacted slowly—she\nwas halfway up the dais steps before it thought to chase her. The Lord\nRuler, however, sat quietly, watching her with a barely interested\nexpression.\nTwo spears through the chest didn’t even bother him, Vin thought as she\nleapt the last bit of distance up to the top of the dais. He has nothing to fear\nfrom my daggers."

He has nothing to fear\nfrom my daggers.\nWhich was why she didn’t intend to attack him with them. Instead, she\nraised her weapons and plunged directly toward the past-self’s heart.\nHer daggers hit—and passed right through the man, as if he weren’t\nthere. Vin stumbled forward, skidding directly through the image, nearly\nslipping off the dais.\nShe spun, slicing at the image again. Again, her daggers passed through it\nharmlessly. It didn’t even waver or distort.\nMy gold image, she thought in frustration, I was able to touch that. Why\ncan’t I touch this?\nIt obviously didn’t work the same way. The shadow stood still,\ncompletely oblivious of her attacks. She’d thought that maybe, if she killed\nthe past version of the Lord Ruler, his current form would die as well.\nUnfortunately, the past-self appeared to be just as insubstantial as an atium\nshadow.\nShe had failed.\nKar crashed into her, his powerful Inquisitor’s grip grabbing her at the\nshoulders, his momentum carrying her off the dais. They tumbled down the\nback steps.\nVin grunted, flaring pewter. I’m not the same powerless girl you held\nprisoner just a short time ago, Kar, she thought with determination, kicking\nhim upward as they hit the ground behind the throne.\nThe Inquisitor grunted, her kick tossing him into the air and ripping his\ngrip free of her shoulders. Her mistcloak came off in his hands, but she\nflipped to her feet and scrambled away.\n“Inquisitors!” the Lord Ruler bellowed, standing. “Come to me!”\nVin cried out, the powerful voice striking pain in her tin-enhanced ears.\nI have to get out of here, she thought, stumbling. I’ll need to come up\nwith a different way to kill him. . . .\nKar tackled her again from behind. This time he got his arms wrapped\ncompletely around her, and he squeezed. Vin cried out in pain, flaring her\npewter, pushing back, but Kar forced her to her feet. He dexterously\nwrapped one arm around her throat while pinning her own arms behind her\nback with his other. She fought angrily, squirming and struggling, but his\ngrip was tight. She tried throwing them both back with a sudden Steelpush\nagainst a doorlatch, but the anchor was too weak, and Kar barely stumbled.\nHis grip held.\nThe Lord Ruler chuckled as he sat back down on his throne. “You’ll have\nlittle success against Kar, child. He was a soldier, many years ago. He\nknows how to hold a person so that they can’t break his grip, no matter how\nstrong they may be.”\nVin continued to struggle, gasping for breath. The Lord Ruler’s words\nproved true, however. She tried ramming her head back against Kar’s, but\nhe was ready for this.

Another Inquisitor strode into the\nroom, his spikes gleaming in the distorted reflection, his dark robe ruffling.\nThat’s it, she thought in a surreal moment, watching the mists on the\nground before her, creeping through the shattered window wall, flowing\nacross the floor. Oddly, they didn’t curl around her as they usually did—as\nif something were pushing them away. To Vin, it seemed a final testament to\nher defeat.\nI’m sorry, Kelsier. I’ve failed you.\nThe second Inquisitor stepped up beside his companion. Then, he reached\nout and grabbed something at Kar’s back. There was a ripping sound.\nVin dropped immediately to the ground, gasping for breath. She rolled,\npewter allowing her to recover quickly.\nKar stood above her, teetering. Then, he toppled limply to the side,\nsprawling to the ground. The second Inquisitor stood behind him, holding\nwhat appeared to be a large metal spike—just like the ones in the\nInquisitor’s eyes.\nVin glanced toward Kar’s immobile body. The back of his robe had been\nripped, exposing a bloody hole right between the shoulder blades. A hole\nbig enough for a metal spike. Kar’s scarred face was pale. Lifeless.\nAnother spike! Vin thought with wonder. The other Inquisitor pulled it\nout of Kar’s back, and he died. That’s the secret!\n“What?” the Lord Ruler bellowed, standing, the sudden motion tossing\nhis throne backwards. The stone chair toppled down the steps, chipping and\ncracking the marble. “Betrayal! From one of my own!”\nThe new Inquisitor dashed toward the Lord Ruler. As he ran, his robe\ncowl fell back, giving Vin a view of his bald head. There was something\nfamiliar about the newcomer’s face despite the spike-heads coming out the\nfront—and the gruesome spike-tips jutting from the back—of his skull.\nDespite the bald head and the unfamiliar clothing, the man looked a little\nlike Kelsier.\nNo, she realized. Not Kelsier.\nMarsh!\nMarsh took the dais steps in twos, moving with an Inquisitor’s\nsupernatural speed. Vin struggled to her feet, shrugging off the effects of\nher near-choking. Her surprise, however, was more difficult to dismiss.\nMarsh was alive.\nMarsh was an Inquisitor.\nThe Inquisitors weren’t investigating him because they suspected him.\nThey intended to recruit him! And now he looked like he intended to fight\nthe Lord Ruler. I’ve got to help! Perhaps . . . perhaps he knows the secret to\nkilling the Lord Ruler. He figured out how to kill Inquisitors, after all!\nMarsh reached the top of the dais.\n“Inquisitors!” the Lord Ruler yelled. “Come to—”\nThe Lord Ruler froze, noticing something sitting just outside the door. A\nsmall group of steel spikes, just like the one Marsh had pulled from Kar’s\nback, lay piled on the floor. There looked to be about seven of them.\nMarsh smiled, the expression looking eerily like one of Kelsier’s smirks."

There looked to be about seven of them.\nMarsh smiled, the expression looking eerily like one of Kelsier’s smirks.\nVin reached the bottom of the dais and Pushed herself off a coin, throwing\nherself up toward the top of the platform.\nThe awesome, full power of the Lord Ruler’s fury hit her halfway up.\nThe depression, the anger-fueled asphyxiation of her soul, pushed through\nher copper, hitting her like a physical force. She flared copper, gasping\nslightly, but wasn’t completely able to push the Lord Ruler off of her\nemotions.\nMarsh stumbled slightly, and the Lord Ruler swung a backhand much\nlike the one that had killed Kelsier. Fortunately, Marsh recovered in time to\nduck. He spun around the Lord Ruler, reaching up to grab the back of the\nemperor’s black, robelike suit. Marsh yanked, ripping the cloth open along\nthe back seam.\nMarsh froze, his spike-eyed expression unreadable. The Lord Ruler spun,\nslamming his elbow into Marsh’s stomach, throwing the Inquisitor across\nthe room. As the Lord Ruler turned, Vin could see what Marsh had seen.\nNothing. A normal, if muscular, back. Unlike the Inquisitors, the Lord\nRuler didn’t have a spike driven through his spine.\nOh, Marsh . . . Vin thought with a sinking depression. It had been a\nclever idea, far more clever than Vin’s foolish attempt with the Eleventh\nMetal—however, it had proven equally faulty.\nMarsh finally hit the ground, his head cracking, then slid across the floor\nuntil he ran into the far wall. He lay slumped against the massive window,\nimmobile.\n“Marsh!” she cried, jumping and Pushing herself toward him. However,\nas she flew, the Lord raised his hand absently.\nVin felt a powerful . . . something crash into her. It felt like a Steelpush,\nslamming against the metals inside her stomach—but of course it couldn’t\nhave been that. Kelsier had promised that no Allomancer could affect\nmetals that were inside of someone’s body.\nBut he had also said that no Allomancer could affect the emotions of a\nperson who was burning copper.\nDiscarded coins shot away from the Lord Ruler, streaking across the\nfloor. The doors wrenched free from their mountings, shattering and\nbreaking away from the room. Incredibly, bits of colored glass even\nquivered and slid away from the dais.\nAnd Vin was tossed to the side, the metals in her stomach threatening to\nrip free from her body. She slammed to the ground, the blow knocking her\nnearly unconscious. She lay in a daze, addled, confused, able to think of\nonly one thing.\nSuch power . . .\nClicks sounded as the Lord Ruler walked down his dais. He moved\nquietly, ripping off his torn suit coat and shirt, leaving himself bare from the\nwaist up save for the jewelry sparkling on his fingers and wrists.

Keeps them from being Pushed\nor Pulled.\nThe Lord Ruler shook his head regretfully, his steps kicking up trails in\nthe cool mist that poured across the floor from the broken window. He\nlooked so strong, his torso erupting with muscles, his face handsome. She\ncould feel the power of his Allomancy snapping at her emotions, barely\nheld back by her copper.\n“What did you think, child?” the Lord Ruler asked quietly. “To defeat\nme? Am I some common Inquisitor, my powers endowed fabrications?”\nVin flared pewter. She then turned and dashed away—intending to grab\nMarsh’s body and break through the glass at the other side of the room.\nBut then, he was there, moving with a speed as if to make the fury of a\ntornado’s winds seem sluggish. Even within a full pewter flare, Vin couldn’t\noutrun him. He almost seemed casual as he reached out, grabbing her\nshoulder and yanking her backward.\nHe flung her like a doll, tossing her toward one of the room’s massive\nsupport pillars. Vin quested desperately for an anchor, but he had blown all\nof the metal out of the room. Except . . .\nShe Pulled on one of the Lord Ruler’s own bracelets, ones that didn’t\npierce his skin. He immediately whipped his arm upward, throwing off her\nPull, making her spin maladroitly in the air. He slammed her with another\nof his powerful Pushes, blasting her backward. Metals in her stomach\nwrenched, glass quivered, and her mother’s earring ripped free of her ear.\nShe tried to spin and hit feet-first, but she crashed into a stone pillar at a\nterrible speed, and pewter failed her. She heard a sickening snap, and a\nspear of pain shot up her right leg.\nShe collapsed to the ground. She didn’t have the will to look, but the\nagony from her torso told her that her leg jutted from beneath her body,\nbroken at an awkward angle.\nThe Lord Ruler shook his head. No, Vin realized, he didn’t worry about\nwearing jewelry. Considering his abilities and strength, a man would have\nto be foolish—as Vin had been—to try and use the Lord Ruler’s jewelry as\nan anchor. It had only let him control her jumps.\nHe stepped forward, feet clicking against broken glass. “You think this is\nthe first time someone has tried to kill me, child? I’ve survived burnings\nand beheadings. I’ve been stabbed and sliced, crushed and dismembered. I\nwas even flayed once, near the beginning.”\nHe turned toward Marsh, shaking his head. Strangely, Vin’s earlier\nimpression of the Lord Ruler returned. He looked . . . tired. Exhausted,\neven. Not his body—it was still muscular. It was just his . . . air. She tried to\nclimb to her feet, using the stone pillar for stability.\n“I am God,” he said.\nSo different from the humble man in the logbook.\n“God cannot be killed,” he said. “God cannot be overthrown. Your\nrebellion—you think I haven’t seen its like before? You think I haven’t\ndestroyed entire armies on my own? What will it take before you people"

How many centuries must I prove myself before you idiot\nskaa see the truth? How many of you must I kill!”\nVin cried out as she twisted her leg the wrong way. She flared pewter, but\ntears came to her eyes anyway. She was running out of metals. Her pewter\nwould be gone soon, and there was no way she would be able to remain\nconscious without it. She slumped against the pillar, the Lord Ruler’s\nAllomancy pressing against her. The pain in her leg throbbed.\nHe’s just too strong, she thought with despair. He’s right. He is God.\nWhat were we thinking?\n“How dare you?” the Lord Ruler asked, picking up Marsh’s limp body\nwith a bejeweled hand. Marsh groaned slightly, trying to lift his head.\n“How dare you?” the Lord Ruler demanded again. “After what I gave\nyou? I made you superior to regular men! I made you dominant!”\nVin’s head snapped up. Through the haze of pain and hopelessness,\nsomething triggered a memory inside of her.\nHe keeps saying . . . he keeps saying that his people should be dominant.\n. . .\nShe reached within, feeling her last little bit of Eleventh Metal reserve.\nShe burned it, looking through tearstained eyes as the Lord Ruler held\nMarsh in a one-handed grip.\nThe Lord Ruler’s past self appeared next to him. A man in a fur cloak and\nheavy boots, a man with a full beard and strong muscles. Not an aristocrat\nor a tyrant. Not a hero, or even a warrior. A man dressed for life in the cold\nmountains. A herdsman.\nOr, perhaps, a packman.\n“Rashek,” Vin whispered.\nThe Lord Ruler spun toward her in startlement.\n“Rashek,” Vin said again. “That’s your name, isn’t it? You aren’t the man\nwho wrote the logbook. You’re not the hero that was sent to protect the\npeople . . . you’re his servant. The packman who hated him.”\nShe paused for a moment. “You . . . you killed him,” she whispered.\n“That’s what happened that night! That’s why the logbook stopped so\nsuddenly! You killed the hero and took his place. You went into the cavern\nin his stead, and you claimed the power for yourself. But . . . instead of\nsaving the world, you took control of it.”\n“You know nothing!” he bellowed, still holding Marsh’s limp body in\none hand. “You know nothing of that!”\n“You hated him,” Vin said. “You thought that a Terrisman should have\nbeen the hero. You couldn’t stand the fact that he—a man from the country\nthat had oppressed yours—was fulfilling your own legends.”\nThe Lord Ruler lifted a hand, and Vin suddenly felt an impossible weight\npress against her. Allomancy, Pushing the metals in her stomach and in her\nbody, threatening to crush her back against the pillar. She cried out, flaring\nher last bit of pewter, struggling to remain conscious. Mists curled around\nher, creeping through the broken window and across the floor."

It sounded like . . . like cheering. Yells of joy, thousands in\nchorus. It sounded almost like they were cheering her on.\nWhat does it matter? she thought. I know the Lord Ruler’s secret, but\nwhat does it tell me? That he was a packman? A servant? A Terrisman?\nA Feruchemist.\nShe looked through dazed eyes, and again saw the pair of bracelets\nglittering on the Lord Ruler’s upper arms. Bracelets made of metal,\nbracelets that pierced his skin in places. So . . . so that they couldn’t be\naffected by Allomancy. Why do that? He supposedly wore metal as a sign\nof bravado. He wasn’t worried about people Pulling or Pushing against his\nmetals.\nOr, that was what he claimed. But, what if all the other metals he wore—\nthe rings, the bracelets, the fashion that had made its way to the nobility—\nwere simply a distraction?\nA distraction to keep people from focusing on this one pair of bracers,\ntwisting around the upper arms. Could it really be that easy? she thought as\nthe Lord Ruler’s weight threatened to crush her.\nHer pewter was nearly gone. She could barely think. Yet, she burned iron.\nThe Lord Ruler could pierce copperclouds. She could too. They were the\nsame, somehow. If he could affect metals inside of a person’s body, then she\ncould as well.\nShe flared the iron. Blue lines appeared pointing to the Lord Ruler’s rings\nand bracelets—all of them but the ones on his upper arms, piercing his skin.\nVin stoked her iron, concentrating, Pushing it as hard as she could. She\nkept her pewter flared, struggling to keep from being crushed, and she knew\nsomehow that she was no longer breathing. The force pushing against her\nwas too strong. She couldn’t get her chest to go up and down.\nMist spun around her, dancing because of her Allomancy. She was dying.\nShe knew it. She could barely even feel the pain anymore. She was being\ncrushed. Suffocated.\nShe drew upon the mists.\nTwo new lines appeared. She screamed, Pulling with a strength she had\nnever known before.

The Lord Ruler cried out in pain, a faint,\ndistant sound to Vin’s ears. The weight suddenly released her, and she\ndropped to the floor, gasping, her vision swimming.

The bracelets dropped in front\nof its red light, sparkling for a moment before plunging down into the city.\n“No!” the Lord Ruler screamed, stepping toward the window.\nHis muscles grew limp, deflating as Sazed’s had. He turned back toward\nVin, angry, but his face was no longer that of a young man. He was middle-\naged, his youthful features matured.\nHe stepped toward the window. His hair grayed, and wrinkles formed\naround his eyes like tiny webs.\nHis next step was feeble. He began to shake with the burden of old age,\nhis back stooping, his skin sagging, his hair growing limp.\nThen, he collapsed to the floor.\nVin leaned back, her mind fuzzing from the pain.

She flared tin, and the sudden increase of sensitivity shocked her\nawake. She gasped, looking up at Sazed’s concerned face.\n“Careful, Mistress,” he said, inspecting her leg. “The bone is fractured,\nthough it appears only in one place.”\n“Marsh,” she said, exhausted. “See to Marsh.”\n“Marsh?” Sazed asked. Then he saw the Inquisitor stirring slightly on the\nfloor a distance away.\n“By the Forgotten Gods!” Sazed said, moving to Marsh’s side.\nMarsh groaned, sitting up. He cradled his stomach with one arm. “What .\n. . is that . . .?”\nVin glanced at the withered form on the ground a short distance away.\n“It’s him. The Lord Ruler. He’s dead.”\nSazed frowned curiously, standing. He wore a brown robe, and had\nbrought a simple wooden spear with him. Vin shook her head at the thought\nof such a pitiful weapon facing the creature that had nearly killed her and\nMarsh.\nOf course. In a way, we were all just as useless. We should be dead, not\nthe Lord Ruler.\nI pulled his bracelets off. Why? Why can I do things like he can?\nWhy am I different?\n“Mistress . . .” Sazed said slowly. “He is not dead, I think. He’s . . . still\nalive.”\n“What?” Vin asked, frowning. She could barely think at the moment.\nThere would be time to sort out her questions later. Sazed was right—the\naged figure wasn’t dead.

The crawling figure reached the edge of the room, overlooking the\ncity through the shattered window.\nVin’s footsteps crackled on broken glass. People cheered again below,\nthough she couldn’t see them, nor see what they were cheering about.\n“Listen,” Sazed said. “Listen, he who would have been our god. Do you\nhear them cheering? Those cheers aren’t for you—this people never cheered\nfor you. They have found a new leader this evening, a new pride.”\n“My . . . obligators . . .” the Lord Ruler whispered.\n“Your obligators will forget you,” Marsh said. “I will see to that. The\nother Inquisitors are dead, slain by my own hand. Yet, the gathered prelans\nsaw you transfer power to the Canton of Inquisition. I am the only\nInquisitor left in Luthadel. I rule your church now.”\n“No . . .” the Lord Ruler whispered.\nMarsh, Vin, and Sazed stopped in a ragged group, looking down at the\nold man. In the morning light below, Vin could see a massive collection of\npeople standing before a large podium, holding up their weapons in a sign\nof respect.\nThe Lord Ruler cast his eyes down at the crowd, and the final realization\nof his failure seemed to hit him. He looked back up at the ring of people\nwho had defeated him.\n“You don’t understand,” he wheezed. “You don’t know what I do for\nmankind. I was your god, even if you couldn’t see it. By killing me, you\nhave doomed yourselves. . . .”\nVin glanced at Marsh and Sazed. Slowly, each of them nodded. The Lord\nRuler had begun coughing, and he seemed to be aging even further.\nVin leaned on Sazed, her teeth gritted against the pain of her broken leg.\n“I bring you a message from a friend of ours,” she said quietly. “He wanted\nyou to know that he’s not dead. He can’t be killed.\n“He is hope.”\nThen she raised the spear and rammed it directly into the Lord Ruler’s\nheart.\nOddly, on occasion, I sense a peacefulness within. You would think that after all I have seen—after all I have suffered—my soul would be a twisted jumble of stress,\nconfusion, and melancholy. Often, it’s just that.\nBut then, there is the peace.\nI feel it sometimes, as I do now, staring out over the frozen cliffs and glass mountains in the still of morning, watching a sunrise that is so majestic that I know that\nnone shall ever be its match."

Sazed had carried a message to the rest of the crew, telling them\nof Vin’s survival. Apparently, there had been no major casualties among the\nothers—for which Vin was glad. She hadn’t gone to them yet, however.\nSazed had told them that she needed to rest, and they were busy setting up\nElend’s new government.\n“A Feruchemist and an Allomancer,” Marsh said speculatively.

He leaned\ndown, resting one arm on his knee, staring out over the city with spikes\ninstead of eyes.\nHow does he even see? Vin wondered.\n“Yes, Master Marsh,” Sazed explained. “You see, youth is one of the\nthings that a Feruchemist can store. It’s a fairly useless process—in order to\nstore up the ability to feel and look a year younger, you would have to\nspend part of your life feeling and looking one year older. Often, Keepers\nuse the ability as a disguise, changing ages to fool others and hide. Beyond\nthis, however, no one has ever seen much use for the ability.\n“However, if the Feruchemist were also an Allomancer, he might be able\nto burn his own metal storages, releasing the energy within them tenfold.\nMistress Vin tried to burn some of my metals earlier, but couldn’t access the\npower. However, if you were able to make up the Feruchemical storages\nyourself, then burn them for the extra power . . .”\nMarsh frowned. “I don’t follow you, Sazed.”\n“I apologize,” Sazed said. “This is, perhaps, a thing that is difficult to\nunderstand without a background in both Allomantic and Feruchemical\ntheory. Let me see if I can explain it better. What is the main difference\nbetween Allomancy and Feruchemy?”\n“Allomancy draws its power from metals,” Marsh said. “Feruchemy\ndraws its powers from the person’s own body.”\n“Exactly,” Sazed said. “So, what the Lord Ruler did—I presume—was\ncombine these two abilities. He used one of the attributes only available to\nFeruchemy—that of changing his age—but fueled it with Allomancy"

By burning a Feruchemical storage that he himself had made, he\neffectively made a new Allomantic metal for himself—one that made him\nyounger when he burned it. If my guess is correct, he would have gained a\nlimitless supply of youth, since he was drawing most of his power from the\nmetal itself, rather than his own body. All he would have to do was spend\nthe occasional bit of time aged to give himself Feruchemical storages to\nburn and stay young.”\n“So,” Marsh said, “just burning those storages would make him even\nyounger than when he started?”\n“He would have had to place that excess youth inside of another\nFeruchemical storage, I think,” Sazed explained. “You see, Allomancy is\nquite spectacular—its powers generally come in bursts and flares. The Lord\nRuler wouldn’t have wanted all of that youth at once, so he’d have stored it\ninside of a piece of metal which he could slowly drain, keeping himself\nyoung.”\n“The bracelets?”\n“Yes, Master Marsh. However, Feruchemy gives decreasing returns—it\ntakes more than the proportionate amount of strength, for instance, to make\nyourself four times as strong as a regular man, as opposed to simply twice\nas strong. In the Lord Ruler’s case, this meant that he had to spend more\nand more youth to keep from aging. When Mistress Vin stole the bracelets,\nhe aged incredibly quickly because his body was trying to stretch back to\nwhere it should have been.”\nVin sat in the cool evening wind, staring out toward Keep Venture. It was\nbright with light; not even a single day had passed, and Elend was already\nmeeting with skaa and noblemen leaders, drafting a code of laws for his\nnew nation.\nVin sat quietly, fingering her earring. She’d found it in the throne room,\nhad put it back in her torn ear as it began to heal. She wasn’t certain why\nshe kept it. Perhaps because it was a link to Reen, and the mother who had\ntried to kill her. Or, perhaps, simply because it was a reminder of things she\nshouldn’t have been able to do.\nThere was much to learn, still, about Allomancy. For a thousand years,\nthe nobility had simply trusted what the Inquisitors and Lord Ruler told\nthem. What secrets had they shadowed, what metals had they hidden?\n“The Lord Ruler,” she finally said. “He . . . just used a trick to be\nimmortal, then. That means he wasn’t ever really a god, right? He was just\nlucky. Anyone who was both a Feruchemist and an Allomancer could have\ndone what he did.”\n“It appears that way, Mistress,” Sazed said. “Perhaps that was why he\nfeared Keepers so much. He hunted and killed Feruchemists, for he knew\nthat the skill was hereditary—just as Allomancy is. If the Terris lines ever\nmixed with those of the imperial nobility, the result could very well have\nbeen a child who could challenge him.”\n“Hence the breeding programs,” Marsh said.\nSazed nodded. “He needed to make absolutely sure that the Terrismen"

He did such horrible things to\nthem just to keep hold of his power.”\n“But,” Vin said, frowning, “if the Lord Ruler’s powers came from a\nmixture of Feruchemy and Allomancy, what happened at the Well of\nAscension? What was the power that the man who wrote the logbook—\nwhoever he was—was supposed to find?”\n“I don’t know, Mistress,” Sazed said quietly.\n“Your explanation doesn’t answer everything,” Vin said, shaking her\nhead. She hadn’t spoken of her own strange abilities, but she had spoken of\nwhat the Lord Ruler had done in the throne room. “He was so powerful,\nSazed. I could feel his Allomancy. He was able to Push on metals inside my\nbody! Perhaps he could enhance his Feruchemy by burning the storages, but\nhow did he get so strong at Allomancy?”\nSazed sighed. “I fear that the only person who could have answered these\nquestions died this morning.”\nVin paused. The Lord Ruler had held secrets about the Terris religion that\nSazed’s people had been searching for centuries to find. “I’m sorry. Maybe I\nshouldn’t have killed him.”\nSazed shook his head. “His own aging would have killed him soon\nanyway, Mistress. What you did was right. This way, I can record that the\nLord Ruler was struck down by one of the skaa he had oppressed.”\nVin flushed. “Record?”\n“Of course. I am still a Keeper, Mistress. I must pass these things on—\nhistory, events, and truths.”\n“You won’t . . . say too much about me, will you?” For some reason the\nidea of other people telling stories about her made her uncomfortable.\n“I wouldn’t worry too much, Mistress,” Sazed said with a smile. “My\nbrethren and I will be very busy, I think. We have so much to restore, so\nmuch to tell the world. . . . I doubt details about you need to be passed on\nwith any urgent timing. I will record what happened, but I will keep it to\nmyself for a while, if you wish.”\n“Thank you,” Vin said, nodding.\n“That power that the Lord Ruler found in the cave,” Marsh said\nspeculatively, “perhaps it was just Allomancy. You said that there is no\nrecord of any Allomancers before the Ascension.”\n“It is indeed a possibility, Master Marsh,” Sazed said. “There are very\nfew legends about the origins of Allomancy, and nearly all of them agree\nthat Allomancers first ‘appeared with the mists.’ ”\nVin frowned. She’d always assumed that the title “Mistborn” had come\nabout because Allomancers tended to do their work at night. She’d never\nconsidered that there might be a stronger connection.\nMist reacts to Allomancy. It swirls when an Allomancer uses his abilities\nnearby. And . . . what did I feel at the end?

It was like I drew something\nfrom the mists.\nWhatever she’d done, she hadn’t been able to replicate it.\nMarsh sighed and stood. He had been awake only a few hours, but he\nalready seemed tired. His head hung slightly, as if the weight of the spikes\nwere pulling it down.\n“Does that . . . hurt, Marsh?” she asked. “The spikes, I mean?”\nHe paused. “Yes. All eleven of them . . . throb. The pain reacts to my\nemotions somehow.”\n“Eleven?” Vin asked with shock.\nMarsh nodded. “Two in the head, eight in the chest, one in the back to\nseal them together. That’s the only way to kill an Inquisitor—you have to\nseparate the top spikes from the bottom ones. Kell did it through a\nbeheading, but it’s easier to just pull out the middle spike.”\n“We thought you were dead,” Vin said. “When we found the body and\nthe blood at the Soothing station . . .”\nMarsh nodded. “I was going to send word of my survival, but they\nwatched me fairly closely that first day. I didn’t expect Kell to make his\nmove so quickly.”\n“None of us did, Master Marsh,” Sazed said. “None of us expected it at\nall.”\n“He actually did it, didn’t he?” Marsh said, shaking his head in wonder.\n“That bastard. There are two things I’ll never forgive him for. The first is\nfor stealing my dream of overthrowing the Final Empire, then actually\nsucceeding at it.”\nVin paused. “And the second?”\nMarsh turned spike-heads toward her. “Getting himself killed to do it.”\n“If I may ask, Master Marsh,” Sazed said. “Who was that corpse that\nMistress Vin and Master Kelsier discovered at the Soothing station?”\nMarsh looked back over the city. “There were several corpses, actually.\nThe process to create a new Inquisitor is . . . messy. I’d rather not speak\nabout it.”\n“Of course,” Sazed said, bowing his head.\n“You, however,” Marsh said, “could tell me about this creature that\nKelsier used to imitate Lord Renoux.”\n“The kandra?” Sazed said. “I fear even the Keepers know little of them.\nThey are related to mistwraiths—perhaps even the same creatures, just\nolder. Because of their reputation, they generally prefer to remain unseen—\nthough some of the noble houses hire them on occasion.”\nVin frowned. “So . . . why didn’t Kell just have this kandra impersonate\nhim and die in his stead?”\n“Ah,” Sazed said. “You see, Mistress, for a kandra to impersonate\nsomeone, they first must devour that person’s flesh and absorb their bones.\nKandra are like mistwraiths—they have no skeletons of their own.”\nVin shivered. “Oh.”\n“He is back, you know,” Marsh said. “The creature is no longer using my\nbrother’s body—he has another one—but he came looking for you, Vin.”\n“Me?” Vin asked.\nMarsh nodded. “He said something about Kelsier transferring his"

That . . . thing ate Kelsier’s body. “I don’t want it around,”\nshe said. “I’ll send it away.”\n“Do not be quite so hasty, Mistress,” Sazed said. “Kandra are expensive\nservants—you must pay them in atium. If Kelsier bought an extended\ncontract for one, it would be foolish to waste its services. A kandra might\nprove a very useful ally in the months to come.”\nVin shook her head. “I don’t care. I don’t want that thing around. Not\nafter what it did.”\nThe trio fell silent. Finally, Marsh stood, sighing. “Anyway, if you will\nexcuse me, I should go make an appearance at the keep—the new king\nwants me to represent the Ministry in his negotiations.”\nVin frowned. “I don’t see why the Ministry deserves any say in things.”\n“The obligators are still quite powerful, Mistress,” Sazed said. “And,\nthey are the most efficient and well-trained bureaucratic force in the Final\nEmpire. His majesty would be wise to try and bring them to his side, and\nrecognizing Master Marsh may help achieve this.”\nMarsh shrugged. “Of course, assuming I can establish control over the\nCanton of Orthodoxy, the Ministry should . . . change during the next few\nyears. I’ll move slowly and carefully, but by the time I’m done, the\nobligators won’t even realize what they’ve lost. Those other Inquisitors\ncould present a problem, though.”\nVin nodded. “How many are there outside of Luthadel?”\n“I don’t know,” Marsh said. “I wasn’t a member of the order for very\nlong before I destroyed it. However, the Final Empire was a big place.\nMany speak of there being around twenty Inquisitors in the empire, but I\nnever was able to pin anyone down on a hard number.”\nVin nodded as Marsh left. However, the Inquisitors—while dangerous—\nworried her far less now that she knew their secret. She was more\nconcerned about something else.\nYou don’t know what I do for mankind. I was your god, even if you\ncouldn’t see it. By killing me, you have doomed yourselves. . . .\nThe Lord Ruler’s final words. At the time, she thought he’d been\nreferring to the Final Empire as the thing he did “for mankind.” However,\nshe wasn’t so certain anymore. There had been . . . fear in his eyes when\nhe’d spoken those words, not pride.\n“Saze?” she said. “What was the Deepness? The thing that the Hero from\nthe logbook was supposed to defeat?”\n“I wish that we knew, Mistress,” Sazed said.\n“But, it didn’t come, right?”\n“Apparently not,” Sazed said. “The legends agree that had the Deepness\nnot been stopped, the very world would have been destroyed.

He hadn’t\ndecided yet.\n“You should go to him, Mistress,” Sazed said. “He needs to see that you\nare well.”\nVin didn’t reply immediately. She stared out over the city, watching the\nbright keep in the darkening sky. “Were you there, Sazed?” she asked. “Did\nyou hear his speech?”\n“Yes, Mistress,” he said. “Once we discovered that there was no atium in\nthat treasury, Lord Venture insisted that we go seek help for you. I was\ninclined to agree with him—neither of us were warriors, and I was still\nwithout my Feruchemical storages.”\nNo atium, Vin thought. After all of this, we haven’t found a speck of it.\nWhat did the Lord Ruler do with it all? Or . . . did someone else get to it\nfirst?\n“When Master Elend and I found the army,” Sazed continued, “its rebels\nwere slaughtering the palace soldiers. Some of them tried to surrender, but\nour soldiers weren’t letting them. It was a . . . disturbing scene, Mistress.\nYour Elend . . . he didn’t like what he saw. When he stood up there before\nthe skaa, I thought that they would simply kill him too.”\nSazed paused, cocking his head slightly. “But . . . the things he said,\nMistress . . . his dreams of a new government, his condemnation of\nbloodshed and chaos . . . Well, Mistress, I fear that I cannot repeat it. I wish\nI’d had my metalminds, so that I could have memorized his exact words.”\nHe sighed, shaking his head. “Regardless, I believe that Master Breeze\nwas very influential in helping calm that riot. Once one group started\nlistening to Master Elend, the others did too, and from there . . . well, it is a\ngood thing that a nobleman ended up as king, I think. Master Elend brings\nsome legitimacy to our bid for control, and I think that we will see more\nsupport from the nobility and the merchants with him at our head.”\nVin smiled. “Kell would be angry with us, you know. He did all this\nwork, and we just turned around and put a nobleman on the throne.”\nSazed shook his head. “Ah, but there is something more important to\nconsider, I think. We didn’t just put a nobleman on the throne—we put a\ngood man on the throne.”"

The\nnobility saw Elend as a puppet they could control, and factions were already\nappearing amongst the skaa leadership.\nStill, Elend finally had an opportunity to draft the law code he’d been\ndreaming of. He could try to create the perfect nation, try to apply the\nphilosophies he had studied for so long. There would be bumps, and Vin\nsuspected that he would ultimately have to settle for something far more\nrealistic than his idealistic dream. That didn’t really matter.

Around him, ash fell from the sky in fat,\nlazy flakes. It wasn’t the burnt white ash that one saw in dead coals; this\nwas a deeper, harsher black ash. The Ashmounts had been particularly\nactive lately.\nElend felt the ash dust his face and clothing, but he ignored it. In the\ndistance, the bloody red sun was close to setting. It backlit the army which\nhad come to take Elend’s kingdom from him.\n“How many?” Elend asked quietly.\n“Fifty thousand, we think,” Ham said, leaning against the parapet, beefy\narms folded on the stone. Like everything in the city, the wall had been\nstained black by countless years of ashfalls.\n“Fifty thousand soldiers . . .” Elend said, trailing off. Despite heavy\nrecruitment, Elend barely had twenty-thousand men under his command—\nand they were peasants with under a year of training. Maintaining even that\nsmall number was straining his resources. If they’d been able to find the\nLord Ruler’s atium, perhaps things would be different. As it was, Elend’s\nrule was in serious danger of economic disaster.\n“I don’t know, El,” Ham said quietly. “Kelsier was always the one with\nthe vision.”\n“But you helped him plan,” Elend said. “You and the others, you were his\ncrew. You were the ones who came up with a strategy for overthrowing the\nempire, then made it happen.”\nHam fell silent, and Elend felt as if he knew what the man was thinking.\nKelsier was central to it all. He was the one who organized, the one who\ntook all of the wild brainstorming and turned it into a viable operation. He\nwas the leader. The genius.\nAnd he’d died a year before, on the very same day that the people—as\npart of his secret plan—had risen up in fury to overthrow their god emperor.\nElend had taken the throne in the ensuing chaos. Now it was looking more\nand more like he would lose everything that Kelsier and his crew had\nworked so hard to accomplish. Lose it to a tyrant who might be even worse\nthan the Lord Ruler. A petty, devious, bully in “noble” form. The man who\nhad marched his army on Luthadel.\nElend’s own father, Straff Venture.\n“Any chance you can . . . talk him out of attacking?” Ham asked.\n“Maybe,” Elend said hesitantly. “Assuming the Assembly doesn’t just\nsurrender the city.”\n“They close?”\n“I don’t know, honestly. I worry that they are. That army has frightened"

That army has frightened\nthem, Ham.” And with good reason, he thought. “Anyway, I have a proposal\nfor the meeting in two days. I’ll try to talk them out of doing anything rash.\nDockson got back today, right?”\nHam nodded. “Just before the army’s advance.”\n“I think we should call a meeting of the crew,” Elend said. “See if we can\ncome up with a way out of this.”\n“We’ll still be pretty shorthanded,” Ham said, rubbing his chin. “Spook\nisn’t supposed to be back for another week, and the Lord Ruler only knows\nwhere Breeze went. We haven’t had a message from him in months.”\nElend sighed, shaking his head. “I can’t think of anything else, Ham.” He\nturned, staring out over the ashen landscape again. The army was lighting\ncampfires as the sun set. Soon, the mists would appear.\nI need to get back to the palace and work on that proposal, Elend\nthought.\n“Where’d Vin run off to?” Ham asked, turning back to Elend.\nElend paused. “You know,” he said, “I’m not sure.”\nVin landed softly on the damp cobblestones, watching as the mists began to\nform around her. They puffed into existence as darkness fell, growing like\ntangles of translucent vines, twisting and wrapping around one another.\nThe great city of Luthadel was still. Even now—a year after the Lord\nRuler’s death and the rise of Elend’s new free government, the common\npeople stayed in their homes at night. They feared the mists, a tradition that\nwent far deeper than the Lord Ruler’s laws.\nVin slipped forward quietly, senses alert. Inside herself, as always, she\nburned tin and pewter. Tin enhanced her senses, making it easier for her to\nsee in the night. Pewter made her body stronger, made her lighter on her\nfeet. These, along with copper—which had the power to hide her use of\nAllomancy from others who were burning bronze—were metals that she\nleft on almost all the time.\nSome called her paranoid. She thought herself prepared. Either way, the\nhabit had saved her life on numerous occasions.\nShe approached a quiet street corner and paused, peeking out. She’d\nnever really understood how she burned metals—she could remember doing\nit for as long as she’d been alive, using Allomancy instinctively even before\nshe was formally trained by Kelsier. It didn’t really matter to her. She\nwasn’t like Elend; she didn’t need a logical explanation for everything. For\nVin, it was enough that when she swallowed bits of metal, she was able to\ndraw upon their power.\nPower she appreciated, for she well knew what it was like to lack it. Even\nnow, she was not what one would likely envision as a warrior. Slight of\nframe and barely five feet tall, with dark hair and pale skin, she knew she\nhad an almost frail look about her. She no longer displayed the underfed\nlook she had during her childhood on the streets, but she certainly wasn’t\nsomeone any man would find intimidating."

        "text": "had an almost frail look about her. She no longer displayed the underfed\nlook she had during her childhood on the streets, but she certainly wasn’t\nsomeone any man would find intimidating.\nShe liked that. It gave her an edge—and she needed every edge she could\nget.\nShe also liked the night. During the day, Luthadel was cramped and\nconfining despite its size. But at night the mists fell like a deep cloud. They\ndampened, softened, shaded. Massive keeps became shadowed mountains,\nand crowded tenements melted together like a chandler’s rejected wares.\nVin crouched beside her building, still watching the intersection.\nCarefully, she reached within herself and burned steel—one of the other\nmetals she’d swallowed earlier. Immediately, a group of translucent blue\nlines sprung up around her. Visible only to her eyes, the lines pointed from\nher chest to nearby sources of metal—all metals, no matter what type. The\nthickness of the lines was proportionate to the size of the metal pieces they\nmet. Some pointed to bronze door latches, others to crude iron nails holding\nboards together.\nShe waited silently. None of the lines moved. Burning steel was an easy\nway to tell if someone were moving nearby. If they were wearing bits of\nmetal, they would trail telltale moving lines of blue. Of course, that wasn’t\nthe main purpose of steel. Vin reached her hand carefully into her belt\npouch and pulled out one of the many coins that sat within, muffled by cloth\nbatting. Like all other bits of metal, this coin had a blue line extending from\nits center to Vin’s chest.\nShe flipped the coin into the air, then mentally grabbed its line and—\nburning steel—Pushed on the coin. The bit of metal shot into the air, arcing\nthrough the mists, forced away by the Push. It plinked to the ground in the\nmiddle of the street.\nThe mists continued to spin. They were thick and mysterious, even to\nVin. More dense than a simple fog and more constant than any normal\nweather pattern, they churned and flowed, making rivulets around her. Her\neyes could pierce them—tin made her sight more keen. The night seemed\nlighter to her, the mists less thick. Yet, they were still there.\nA shadow moved in the city square, responding to her coin—which she\nhad Pushed out into the square as a signal. Vin crept forward, and\nrecognized OreSeur the kandra. He wore a different body than he had a year\nago, during the days when he had acted the part of Lord Renoux. Yet, this\nbalding, nondescript body had now become just as familiar to Vin.\nOreSeur met up with her. “Did you find what you were looking for,\nMistress?” he asked, tone respectful—yet somehow still a little hostile. As\nalways.\nVin shook her head, glancing around in the darkness. “Maybe I was\nwrong,” she said. “Maybe I wasn’t being followed.” The acknowledgment\nmade her a bit sad. She’d been looking forward to sparring with the\nWatcher again tonight. She still didn’t even know who he was; the first\nnight, she’d mistaken him for an assassin. And, maybe he was. Yet, he\nseemed to display very little interest in Elend—and a whole lot of interest in\nVin."

At that moment, a burst of coins shot through the mists,\nspraying toward Vin.\nv1.1 proofed by billbo196\nTable of Contents\nPROLOGUE\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\nEPILOGUE"
